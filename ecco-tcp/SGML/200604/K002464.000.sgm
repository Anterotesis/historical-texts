<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is no Per&s;on more Odi|ous than the Man who makes him&s;elf greatly Eminent. It is a &s;ort of tacit Reproach on the re&s;t of the Species: and every one feels his own meanne&s;s the more &s;en&s;ibly, when he looks toward tho&s;e exalted Genius's, who have gain'd a Superi|ority over the re&s;t of mankind. This may make it obvious to imagine, that the following Dialogues are partly de&s;ign'd as Invectives; and produc'd chiefly from that Blind-&s;ide in Self|love, which makes Men willing to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rogate from every one, who has <HI>merit</HI> enough, to provoke; and <HI>fame</HI> enough, to make others think them|&s;elves le&s;&s;en'd by the overgrowth of his Character.</P>
<P>Tho' this rea&s;oning be exceedingly true in general, it ought to be con&s;ider'd
<PB REF="3">
at the &s;ame time, that any di&s;like to the Eminence of others na|turally ari&s;es, only among &s;uch per|&s;ons, as are got into the &s;ame paths of Fame. The Gentlemen of the Sword cannot bear to have others ri&s;e over their head; the Men of Genius look maliciou&s;ly on a prevailing Poet: But <HI>Pope,</HI> I pre&s;ume, never envied <HI>Marlborough</HI> the Battle of <HI>Blenheim,</HI> any more than that Hero envied him his Tran&s;lation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis for this Rea&s;on I might almo&s;t &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, that I <HI>cannot</HI> envy Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ar at lea&s;t I am unbia&s;s'd; I can hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he Applau&s;es, which are given that Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">at Man; I can admire the Pa&s;&s;a|ges, which contribute to the de&s;erv|ing them; but I cannot be unea&s;y at tho&s;e, or detract from the&s;e, out of any prejudices ari&s;ing from this Pa&s;|&s;ion. Give me leave to &s;ay farther, that in reading that Work of his, which occa&s;ion'd this E&s;&s;ay, no one cou'd be more delighted, than I was, in &s;everal parts of it. Many Beauties I &s;aw in it; and I imagin'd I &s;aw &s;ome
<PB REF="4">
Faults: In &s;ome particular Conver&s;a|tions on this Head, I have found my &s;elf indifferent in the Ca&s;e: and now I have here flung the Thoughts on both together, I hope, with &s;ome de|gree of Impartiality. But if &s;ome things &s;hou'd be blamed without &s;uf|ficient Rea&s;on, or others commended too highly, and in a manner di&s;pro|portion'd to what they de&s;erve, I &s;ub|mit each to the many better judges, who may happen to meet with the&s;e &s;heets. I ask pardon for any Errors in them: I beg to be &s;et right.</P>
<P>Prefaces, I think, are the only pla|ces in which a Man may be allow'd to talk freely of that wor&s;t of &s;ub|jects, <HI>Him&s;elf:</HI> I hope no body will deny one the u&s;e of &s;o <HI>aukward a Pri|vilege;</HI> and &s;hall therefore go on with|out any farther Apologies.</P>
<P>To many it may perhaps &s;eem ar|rogant to find fault at all with &s;o di|&s;tingui&s;h'd and &s;o noble a Poet as Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> Indeed here are &s;ome things propo&s;ed as faulty from his Tran&s;lati|on; but they are only propo&s;ed: the
<PB REF="5">
World is to judge of them. Where I have been mi&s;taken in any of the&s;e Points, it is not for want of a due de|ference to the merits of this Writer; but from the &s;hortne&s;s of my own &s;ight. On the contrary, if any &s;uch Criti|ci&s;ms happen &s;ometimes to be right, the Eminence of the Poet will be &s;o far from being a rea&s;on again&s;t them, that it makes any true Cautions the more proper, and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e per|fectly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides: The learned World, as I take it, have ever allow'd a Liberty of thinking and of &s;peaking one's &s;en|timents. That <HI>&s;erene Republick</HI> knows none of the di&s;tance and di&s;tinctions which cu&s;tom has introduced into all others. There is a decent familiari|ty to be admitted between the Great|e&s;t and the Meane&s;t Per&s;on in it. This has often rai&s;ed a Thought in me, which has &s;omething wild and agree|able in it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> when indulged to any de|gree: 'Tis in Relation to the peculi|ar happine&s;s of Men of Letters; in that they can &s;it down in their clo&s;ets
<PB REF="6">
and conver&s;e with the greate&s;t Wri|ters of every Age, or of any Nation; and that in as much freedom and in|timacy, as their neare&s;t Friends cou'd ever u&s;e toward any of them, when living. What an illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly is there on tho&s;e Shelves? The Courts of <HI>Augu&s;tus, Lewis</HI> the Four|teenth, or <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, never beheld &s;uch a frequency of great Ge|nius's, as &s;tand round a Man in his own private Study. How large an Happine&s;s is it for a Per&s;on to have it in his Power to &s;ay at any time, That he is going to &s;pend the After|noon with the mo&s;t agreeable and mo&s;t improving Company, he will chu&s;e out of all Ages? If he is in a gay Humour, perhaps with <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Anacreon,</HI> and L^d <HI>Dor&s;et;</HI> or if more &s;olid, either with <HI>Plato,</HI> Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> or Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis this ea&s;e of acce&s;s, 'tis the li|berty ari&s;ing from it, which con&s;ti|tutes and pre&s;erves the felicity of the <HI>Republick</HI> of Letters. The meaner &s;ort, which compo&s;e it, are all Freevoters;
<PB REF="7">
and may &s;peak their real Opinion without re&s;erve: at the &s;ame time the Characters too, even of the greate&s;t and fir&s;t Men in it, mu&s;t be form'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd on this open|ne&s;s of Judging, and that freedom of Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>But waving whatever has been &s;aid of this Liberty in the Learned World, mo&s;t people will be apt to help one to an Excu&s;e of another kind: for mo&s;t, I think, are very ready to agree, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is only the Ma&s;ter-hand in this Tran&s;lation; and that he has been obliged with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome other Gentle|men in &s;everal parts of it. Tho', I believe, I am acquainted with this affair more than many who &s;peak of it with a great deal of Confidence and A&s;&s;urance, any mention of it in the Piece is purpo&s;ely avoided. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has recommended the whole with his Name; He gives the fini&s;h|ing &s;troke to every thing: and the Dialogues &s;peak of him, as if he were really the Author of the whole. It
<PB REF="8">
wou'd have been a confu&s;ed thing, and often not practicable, to have &s;poken at every turn to the right Per|&s;on. This has occa&s;ion'd &s;everal ap|plau&s;es of the Poet, which may &s;eem too high for a &s;tranger: But as I have &s;ince had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to be per&s;waded, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is not the &s;ole Tran&s;lator; I have at the &s;ame time equal rea&s;on to think, that the other Gentlemen engaged are per&s;ons of e&s;tabli&s;h'd Characters in the Po|e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ick World.&mdash;After this, perhaps, tho&s;e Compliments may &s;till be al|low'd to &s;tand, as they are: I hope they are never wrought too high for Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf; and I believe they may generally be &s;poken very ju&s;tly of his <HI>Seconds</HI> in the Work.</P>
<P>One word more, and I have done. As to the manner of the&s;e Dialogues; 'Tis the old <HI>Platonick</HI> way, which <HI>Cicero</HI> brought from <HI>Greece,</HI> and u&s;ed &s;o happily in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue. It has had its Succe&s;&s;es too among the Moderns: <HI>Fontenelle</HI> will always be read with the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure, where
<PB REF="9">
he has follow'd it; That Writer is peculiarly happy in all his Dialogues, of whatever &s;ort; and, in general, may be &s;aid <HI>to talk as well with Pen and Ink,</HI> as any Man in the World. Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> and Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> have recom|mended it among us by their Exam|ple. Indeed the method it &s;elf is more capable of variety, and (which makes it particularly proper for the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e) it hath &s;omething of Action and Reality in it. Be&s;ides that the common way among us of merely keeping up a Di&s;cour&s;e be|tween two blind Names, is perhaps not very Commendable: the Per&s;ons of the Dialogue in &s;uch Ca&s;es are ge|nerally like tho&s;e Actors, who have no Character in the Play; and who only come in <HI>to talk</HI> upon the Stage. They have no more di&s;tinction, no other marks by which you may know one from another, than the two <HI>Capital Letters,</HI> which u&s;ually &s;tand for them. It is much otherwi&s;e, and and much better, among the Per&s;ons introduced by the Writers in the other
<PB REF="10">
method: their Great Names I u&s;e only to authorize this <HI>manner</HI> of Dia|logue, as that is all which I can pre|tend to imitate in them.</P>
<P>As I ought to beg pardon of the Reader, for troubling him with &s;o long a Preface; I &s;hall at the &s;ame time take the opportunity of begging Pardon of <HI>Antiphaus</HI> and <HI>Philyp&s;us,</HI> (the two Gentlemen who are di&s;|gui&s;ed under the Per&s;ons of the&s;e Dia|logues) for giving to the World, what was chiefly their Thoughts, in a manner &s;o much inferiour to what either of them might have done them|&s;elves. I wi&s;h I might have leave to mention their real Names in this place: That would add a weight to every thing they &s;ay. Tho' indeed the Sentiments of tho&s;e Gentlemen, were they fully repre&s;ented, would not want the lu&s;tre of any Authorities to &s;et them off; except that of the the Rea&s;onablene&s;s with which they both <HI>think</HI> and <HI>&s;peak;</HI> and for both which they have made them&s;elves &s;o remarkable in the World.</P>

<HEAD>An ESSAY &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">EVENING the FIRST.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_ANTIPHAUS</HI> manag'd his Affairs &s;o as to get this Winter &s;ooner than u&s;ual to the Country-&s;eat of his Friend <HI>Philyp&s;us.</HI> It is there that he pa&s;&s;es his time, when ever he can clear him&s;elf from the hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, in a retirement every way agreeable; and in a full en|joyment of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures, which at|tend on a particular Friend&s;hip, in an open and improving Conver&s;ation. The Conver&s;ation there does not run in the pre&s;ent polite way of <HI>&s;aying and &s;aying nothing;</HI> when alone, they u&s;ually fall in|to &s;ome Points of Learning; and as bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h of them are particularly fond of Poetry,
<PB N="2" REF="12">
their Di&s;putes turn more frequently on that Subject, than any other. Indeed their differing in Sentiment can &s;carce be call'd <HI>Di&s;putes;</HI> for whenever their Thoughts do not meet, each of them &s;hews a diffidence in his own Opinion, and a willingne&s;s to &s;ubmit to the Judg|ment of his Friend.</P>
<P>It is by this means that they fall in|to each others Sentiments, more than cou'd well be expected from Men of &s;o different a Turn. The enlarged Geni|us of <HI>Philyp&s;us</HI> always led him to dwell upon the mo&s;t beautified Parts of a Poem with the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure; while <HI>Anti|pha&uuml;s,</HI> who has a very clear Head, and has given much into a &s;trict way of think|ing, is taken mo&s;t with ju&s;t De&s;criptions, and plain natural Ideas: The one was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;t with the Plea&s;ure which he felt from fine Thoughts and warm Expre&s;|&s;ions, that He did not take a full Satis|faction in low Beauty, and &s;imple Re|pre&s;entations of Nature; the other, on the contrary, had &s;uch an aver&s;ion to <HI>glitterings</HI> and <HI>elevation,</HI> that he was di&s;ta&s;ted at any the lea&s;t appearance of either. If the latter was prejudiced for the Ancients, from the Purity and Ju&s;t|ne&s;s, which we find in mo&s;t of their Works; <HI>Philyp&s;us</HI> had his <HI>foible</HI> too, and
<PB N="3" REF="13">
was &s;ometimes caught by the Flouri&s;h and Colouring of the Moderns. In a word, if <HI>Philyp&s;us</HI> wou'd &s;ometimes con|temn a Point as low and mean, tho' in reality proper enough, and naturally ex|pre&s;s'd; <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> in his turn, might happen now and then to blame a Pa&s;&s;age which requir'd a good degree of Orna|ment, as being too glaring and artificial.</P>
<P>Among &s;everal other Topicks, one Evening, they happen'd to fall into a di&s;cour&s;e on Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s new Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> As they both found Beau|ties in that Piece agreeable to their par|ticular Ta&s;tes, they had read it over with a great deal of Plea&s;ure: however <HI>Philyp&s;us</HI> was the Per&s;on who admired it the mo&s;t. "There are &s;ome Lines, &s;ays he to <HI>Antiphaus</HI> (pointing to the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> which lay before them) there are &s;ome Favourites of mine in that Poem, which you mu&s;t not look upon with your u&s;ual &s;everity: Prithee <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> be more &s;en&s;ible to the Flame and Spirit of a Writer, who is evidently Our pre&s;ent <HI>Laureate in Genius,</HI> and the mo&s;t enliven'd Tran&s;lator of the Age. "I will very readily allow what you &s;ay of that Great Man, return'd <HI>Antiphaus;</HI> and &s;hall al|ways pay a deference to your more live|ly ta&s;te of the Fine and Sublime in Poetry;
<PB N="4" REF="14">
but you mu&s;t give me leave to di&s;|&s;ent from you in &s;ome Particulars: if I do not agree with your Sentiments, in relation to &s;everal Lines and Pa&s;&s;ages of that Tran&s;lation, 'tis perhaps becau&s;e I fall &s;o much &s;hort of you, in your <HI>inward &s;en&s;e</HI> of the high and elevated Beauties of Language. As I cannot imagine that to be the rea&s;on, &s;ays <HI>Philyp&s;us,</HI> I beg to hear tho&s;e Particulars you talk'd of; I am per&s;waded, &s;everal of the Pa&s;&s;ages, which I have ob&s;erv'd you to be le&s;s taken with in reading the Tran&s;lation, will upon a clo&s;er view appear to be really Beauties; to tell you the truth, I long to make a Convert of you; and beg you wou'd be full and large in com|municating whatever Remarks you have made on this Performance. The Eve|nings are long; we have &s;ufficient time upon our Hands; and I know not how we can pa&s;s it away more agreeably.</P>
<P><HI>Antiphaus</HI> paus'd for &s;ome time, and &s;eem'd to be taken up in recollecting his Thoughts on this Point: at la&s;t taking a Tablet out of his Pocket, <Q>Since you de&s;ire it (&s;ays he) I will &s;hew you what Ob&s;ervations I made as I went over the Work; they are the Thoughts which &s;truck me <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> and many of them will perhaps appear little and trifling.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="15">
You will allow me, I believe, in the fir&s;t place, That Lines very good in them&s;elves, may be bad when con&s;ider'd as a Tran&s;lation. The aim of a Tran|&s;lator is to give us the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Ori|ginal; and where the Original is ju&s;t, the very <HI>manner</HI> is to be ob&s;erv'd. By the Manner, I would not intend the ex|pre&s;s words, or the meer turn of a Peri|od; but that the Imitation ought to be ea&s;y, &s;imple, and unadorn'd, wherever the fir&s;t Writer u&s;es either of tho&s;e Styles with Judgment. You are well ac|quainted with that plain humble manner of <HI>Homer,</HI> which is more particularly kept up by him in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> And as much as I admire &s;everal parts in this Tran|&s;lation, I cannot but think there are places in it, which differ from the Man|ner of <HI>Homer,</HI> without &s;ufficient rea&s;on for a Change. The Poet, in &s;everal parts of that Work, &s;eems to me to have let fall &s;ome Lines that are forc'd; &s;ome of too much flouri&s;h, and ornament; and a few, even &s;welling, and unnatural; where the Original is with good rea&s;on plain, and natural, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd unadorn'd.</P>
<P>Where we admire the Simplicity of <HI>Homer</HI> with Ju&s;tice, we cannot avoid blaming the want of it in his Tran&s;lator. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> intimates in one of his <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 14. 1.</NOTE> Notes,
<PB N="6" REF="16">
<HI>That</HI> no Reproach has ever fall'n up|on <HI>Homer,</HI> in relation to his &s;inking too Low, or being too Familiar; That as to the&s;e Particulars he pre&s;erves an Uni|ver&s;al Ju&s;tne&s;s: and that there is not any one place in his Poem, which can be ju&s;t|ly cen&s;ur'd upon this account. If &s;o, a Tran&s;lator of <HI>Homer</HI> has no occa&s;ion for rai&s;ing any thing, beyond what it is in the Original; If he follows his Ma&s;ter it is &s;ufficient: All additional Flouri&s;h and Glitterings, where we &s;hould meet with the plain and the familiar, are at be&s;t &s;o many beautiful Excre&s;cencies.</P>
<P>There is one Ca&s;e, which &s;eems more particularly to lead Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> into a gla|ring Stile: 'tis almo&s;t ever to be found in his De&s;criptions of <HI>Day,</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> and of the <HI>Morning.</HI> 'Tis true, the&s;e are &s;ubjects which in them&s;elves may require &s;ome brightne&s;s in the language; but there is a great difference between giv|ing one Light, and dazling ones Eyes. Be&s;ide the conformity to the Original, there is another certain and ea&s;y way of judging, whether the Brightning in the&s;e or any other Points, be proper or not: that Light, we may be &s;ure, falls in a wrong manner, or an undue proportion, which does not make the thing more vi&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="17">
There are of the&s;e De&s;criptions, <HI>Phi|lyp&s;us,</HI> which &s;eem both to refine too much upon the Original, and to err ac|cording to this Rule. Did you ever ob|&s;erve tho&s;e lines on one of the mo&s;t a|greeable Images in the World, The break of Day? they are in the beginning of the third Book: If you will give me leave, I will read them to you.</P>

<P>Several of the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions &s;eemed to me at fir&s;t &s;ight to take from the Nature and Simplicity of the De&s;cription; and when I turn'd to the Greek, I found tho&s;e very Expre&s;&s;ions to have no Foun|dation there. 'Tis the &s;ame Ca&s;e in the following Lines:</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> without que&s;tion is happy in a great &s;hare of Judgment, as well as Vi|vacity and Spirit in Writing: but it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, in &s;o long a Tran&s;la|tion, e&s;pecially as it is in <HI>Rhime,</HI> not to give &s;ometimes into Sound and Orna|ment; when to crown all, the Vogue of the World goes &s;o &s;trong for both. Do not ask, whether I &s;hould de&s;ire to &s;ee
<PB N="20" REF="30">
both of them bani&s;ht out of Poetry; far from it: Expre&s;&s;ive Sounds are of u&s;e in the mo&s;t natural, and Variety in the ma|nagement of them, is nece&s;&s;ary to keep up Attention in the Reader: That, and Ornament, is what &s;ets Poetry above Pro&s;e. All I wou'd &s;ay is this, that Sound is not &s;ufficient where we might expect Sen&s;e; and that in <HI>humble</HI> Pa&s;&s;ages, in <HI>natural</HI> De&s;criptions, or in moving mo&s;t of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> additional ornaments are &s;o many blemi&s;hes.

<P>But You will allow Ornament, where the &s;ubject will bear it, and where the Original leads the Way?&mdash;In a tran&s;lation (an&s;wer'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> it is proper perhaps, only in the latter Ca&s;e; but allowing it in both, it &s;hou'd never be over-wrought in either.

<P>The running into this exce&s;s &s;o much, is what has un&s;inew'd our Poetry. 'Tis with Poetry, as it is in Buildings; the

<P>_ALMOST all the next day <HI>Philyp&s;us</HI> was taken up in reflecting on what had been &s;aid at the clo&s;e of their la&s;t meeting: he be|gan to be not &s;o unea&s;y, as u&s;ual, in thinking that the faults of a favourite Poet were to be lookt into that Evening; he did not value Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> le&s;s than formerly, but he was throughly convinc'd that there was not &s;o much of &s;everity in this Method, as he had once imagin'd. "No: (&s;ays h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to him&s;elf) Let us view impartially, that we may rationally admire: Where be|fore I was immediately in love with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eauties and fond of the Work, I now

feel an equal Plea&s;ure and an equal E&s;teem; but it is in a different manner: I now &s;eem to &s;ee the cau&s;es that move me to be pleas'd with tho&s;e fine Pa&s;&s;ages, and feel a more ju&s;t and manly Satisfaction in them: 'Tis true, the Soul is not hur|ried away with that vehemence of de|light, as formerly; but the agreeable Sen&s;e I now have from them, is both more refin'd, and more la&s;ting. How much is this <HI>rational</HI> way of admiring to be prefer'd to the common, vulgar <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> one? This is as a fla&s;h of Lightning; but the other is like the Light of the Day: 'Tis a &s;erene, dif|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us'd, &s;teady light, which at the &s;ame time that it di&s;covers all Objects to us, is it &s;elf the mo&s;t beautiful of any.</P>
<P>But then (continued he) how blind was I to the defects of this Poet. Has not <HI>Antiphaus</HI> &s;hown me &s;everal, which before I had no &s;en&s;e of, and which now appear evidently to be &s;uch? Indeed that over-&s;ight was more excu&s;able in reading the Works of this celebrated Writer, than it wou'd have been in any other: Rea&s;on may well lo&s;e &s;omething of her Liberty, when &s;he is taken up with an Object every way &s;o agreeable and engaging: However, for the future, I re&s;olve to keep my &s;elf ob&s;tinately from

being over-pleas'd with any thing; and to read his, as all other the be&s;t Pieces, in &s;pight of all their Beauty, by that Rule which <HI>Antiphaus</HI> has laid down.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Thoughts he open'd the Tran&s;lation which lay on his desk; and was very bu&s;y in con&s;idering it, when Company came in, and interrupted him for that Night: The next Day he em|ploy'd him&s;elf in the &s;ame manner; This &s;ort of view was new to him, and of cour&s;e the more agreeable: Sometimes he met with a line or two, that di&s;gu&s;ted him a little; but much more frequently was he &s;truck with the Beauties of the Poem; and tho&s;e he enjoy'd with a full Delight, as he found that Delight to be rational and ju&s;t. This &s;earch drew him on &s;trangely; he did not know how to leave off: And tho' <HI>Antiphaus</HI> &s;tay'd for the Evening before he wou'd di&s;turb him, he found him &s;till clo&s;ely employ'd at it: "My <HI>Philyp&s;us,</HI> (&s;ays he) I'm glad to &s;ee you engag'd thus in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> What new light &s;hall we have into the excellencies of this writer?

But to tell you the Truth,
<PB N="105" REF="115">
my bu&s;ine&s;s was quite contrary to what you imagine: I was upon a more difficult task; I was endeavouring to try what Faults I cou'd di&s;cover in it. That is by much the more difficult, &s;ays <HI>Anti|phaus:</HI> The few Faults of that Piece are &s;carce di&s;cernible among &s;uch a &s;uperi|our number of Beauties: How &s;eldom do we perceive the di&s;agreeablene&s;s of a &s;ingle feature, in a Face that is very taking in the whole?

<P>It was then, you know, that we con|&s;ider'd &s;everal Points in which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> appears to Elevate and Flouri&s;h too much: Have you never ob&s;erved, on the contrary, that there are a few <HI>Low|ne&s;&s;es</HI> in his Writings; and that he &s;ome|times &s;inks into a Diction, which bor|ders on the <HI>Mean</HI> and <HI>Vulgar?</HI> I have, re|ply'd <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> in &s;ome few lines: but if you have made any remarks of that kind, I beg rather to &s;ee tho&s;e of your ob&s;er|vation.</P>

<P>_AFTER having engag'd them&s;elves &s;o far, we may imagine that <HI>Antiphaus</HI> and <HI>Philyp&s;us</HI> waited with a good deal of Impatience for the remaining Part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> As it happen'd, they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oth in Town, before it appear'd in Pub|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ck; and <HI>Philyp&s;us,</HI> who was the warmer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> the two, us'd to enquire almo&s;t every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">y at <HI>Lintot</HI>'s how the Pre&s;s went on. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e grew &s;till the more eager, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">me drew nearer: and the fir&s;t moment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> cou'd procure it <HI>in Sheets,</HI> he &s;et down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> them with all the Plea&s;ure, and all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">verity, that <HI>Antiphaus</HI> had preach'd up to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m in their former Enquiries.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="179">
In the time that was taken up by this agreeable Search, he call'd often upon that Friend, with whom he &s;har'd his Studies, as well as his Affections. This was rather a Dividing, than Leaving his Pur&s;uits: for he &s;carce ever &s;aw <HI>Anti|phaus,</HI> without mentioning &s;omething of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> and hearing his Sentiments in return. When he had gone entirely thorough the Poem, he went immediate|ly to de&s;ire a Meeting, in &s;ome place where they might talk more at large up|on that Head. By good luck <HI>Antiphaus</HI> was perfectly di&s;engag'd: <Q>'Tis a fine Evening, &s;ays he; and if you plea&s;e we will take a turn together in the Gar|dens of <HI>Horatio:</HI> &s;ince we cannot enjoy his Company, at lea&s;t let us make u&s;e of that Liberty he has left with us. There we &s;hall be retir'd from the Noi&s;e, and Bu&s;tle of the Town; and &s;afe from every &s;ort of Interruption.</Q> <HI>Philyp&s;us</HI> was extremely pleas'd to find him &s;o ready: they &s;tept together into his Coach, which drove immediately to <HI>Horatio</HI>'s, and &s;et them down at the Gates which lead into the Great-Walk of the Garden.</P>
<P>After a turn or two there, they &s;at down by the &s;ide of a Fountain, full in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of the <HI>Thames,</HI> which pa&s;&s;es at
<PB N="3" REF="180">
the bottom of the Walk. The Walk it&s;elf makes a fine Vi&s;to in its De|&s;cent to the River: at a di&s;tance, you &s;ee the Fields and Hills; at fir&s;t in an ea&s;y A&s;cent varied into Pa&s;ture and A|rable, and then ri&s;ing unequally, and cover'd here and there with Woods, till they are in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t in a blui&s;h Ca&s;t of the Clouds. The agreeable|ne&s;s of the Place made <HI>Philyp&s;us</HI> forget him&s;elf for a few Moments: he was taken up wholly in wandering with his Eye, &s;ometimes over tho&s;e beautiful Gar|dens, and &s;ometimes over the irregular Pro&s;pect that lay before them. At la&s;t recollecting him&s;elf and turning to <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">aus,</HI> <Q>There is a difference (&s;ays he) in the agreeable Sen&s;e I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eel at pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rom the delightful Views on all &s;ides of us, which may partly confirm what we were talking of ju&s;t before we &s;at down.</Q> Does not this Ma&s;ter-piece of Art, with all its Symmetry and Ju&s;tne&s;s of Proportions, &s;trike the Mind in a fee|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ler manner, than that Landskape of Na|ture in its infinite Irregularity? The&s;e mea&s;ured Ri&s;es and Falls, in Slopes an|&s;wering each other, Tho&s;e Groves ter|minating every way in an exactne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">igure, The&s;e Walks intercro&s;&s;ing with|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut confu&s;ion, and uniting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o happily,
<PB N="4" REF="181">
cannot fail of plea&s;ing the Eye very much: Yet that Wildne&s;s and Variety abroad, the River, Lawn, Fields and Woods &s;o beautifully inter&s;pers'd, compo&s;e a Scene much finer and more engaging. For my part, I &s;hou'd be apt to prefer that &s;ingle Grot yonder, and the hanging Precipice over it, to a whole Scenary of natural Objects laid out in the mo&s;t regular or|der imaginable. There is &s;omething of this in the Plea&s;ure which is given us by the greate&s;t Writers. A Noble natural Genius, however irregular and uncon|fin'd, delights us in a much higher de|gree, than the mo&s;t uniform and correct: And the Writer who enjoys this freedom of Soul, amid&s;t all his Starts and Errors, is greatly to be prefer'd to the Ju&s;tne&s;s of one, who is too &s;evere to commit a Fault, and too cool and phlegmatick to be a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">et.</P>
<P>Such a temper (reply'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> can never produce any thing truly Great. The noble&s;t Poet in the World has not the fewe&s;t Faults: and the &s;ame Spirit which qualified <HI>Homer</HI> to be &s;o, is what at the &s;ame time might hurry him away from a nicer Ob&s;ervation of &s;ome little Particulars. The very Negligencies of <HI>Homer</HI> &s;hew the Greatne&s;s of his Spirit: and where there may be any like Negligencies
<PB N="5" REF="182">
in the Ver&s;ion of <HI>Homer,</HI> me|thinks, it wou'd be but Ju&s;tice to at|tribute them to the &s;ame Cau&s;e: at lea&s;t where the Spirit of that Poet is &s;o di&s;cernible, as it is in this late Tran|&s;lation.</P>
<P>I cannot but &s;mile &s;ometimes, when I hear a &s;everer Reader very gravely condemning a Poem for a few Faults, which may be evident in it here and there. Nothing can be plainer than that our Judgments ought to be form'd upon the Whole, and not upon Particu|lars: the Superiority of Beauties or D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|fects is the only thing that can deter|mine the Character of the Piece. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible that Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> may have ex|pre&s;s'd a word or two correctly, where the New Tran&s;lation has deviated into a Metaphorical or licentious Expre&s;&s;ion: but what a &s;trange method of Compari|&s;on would it be, to &s;ettle our opinion of the Writers from hence? By &s;uch a way of proceeding we might prefer one, who lo&s;es the Life and Vigour of Poetry throughout, to others who pre&s;erve it &s;o &s;trongly in the general Turn of their Compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>As we go on, <HI>Philyp&s;us,</HI> with our u|&s;ual freedom of &s;peaking our Sentiments on each particular Pa&s;&s;age; I dare &s;ay,
<PB N="6" REF="183">
that even all tho&s;e, which may &s;eem faulty to us, will make but a &s;mall fi|gure, when compar'd to the &s;everal Ex|cellencies of this Piece. As for my part, after a Re&s;earch of &s;ome care thro' the whole Tran&s;lation, I find no rea&s;on at all to alter my Opinion, <Q>That the Beau|ties of it are far more numerous, and far more con&s;iderable, than its Ble|mi&s;hes: even taking all tho&s;e things for <HI>real</HI> Blemi&s;hes, which we may only <HI>imagine</HI> to be &s;uch.</Q></P>
<P>If the fa&s;hionable Choice of <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> be ju&s;tly blameable; it may as ju&s;tly be &s;aid that no one moves with more freedom in his Fetters. In particular Lines, there may be &s;ome farther di&s;agreeable <HI>Like|ne&s;&s;es</HI> of Sound; but the <HI>Variety</HI> of Num|bers in general is great and hand&s;ome: What Smoothne&s;s and Harmony do we find thro' the cour&s;e of the Poem; and how &s;eldom are they interrupted either by the <HI>Littlene&s;s,</HI> or the <HI>Va&s;tne&s;s</HI> of the Words? by the <HI>Openne&s;s</HI> of the Vowels, the <HI>Cla&s;hing</HI> of Con&s;onants, or any other Roughne&s;&s;es whatever: Not to mention again&s;t the&s;e, that <HI>Significance</HI> of Sound, which is more frequent, and more hap|pily practis'd by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in parti|cular, than by any other of the Modern Poets.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="184">
As to the <HI>Diction;</HI> not only the Poem but our Language it&s;elf is enrich'd by it. Where it is once Mean, it is in many in&s;tances Great, Noble, and Solemn. Where a Simplicity beyond our Ta&s;te is to be pre&s;erv'd, we may expect &s;ome Flatne&s;&s;es: And it may be to the&s;e per|haps we owe that Ju&s;tne&s;s and Purity, which in &s;o many places makes us ima|gine, that we are conver&s;ing with Per|&s;ons of tho&s;e Fir&s;t Ages of the World, in all their Plainne&s;s and Hone&s;ty of Beha|viour. At other times the Narration is rais'd, and the Images &s;trengthen'd by a figurative way of &s;peaking, tho' no doubt, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to exce&s;s: but the&s;e Exce&s;&s;es may well be pa&s;s'd over, when we con&s;ider, that they proceed from Liberties, which are highly u&s;eful in rendering the Stile the more various and poetical; &s;o far, as frequently to im|prove upon <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Above all, is that <HI>flame</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit</HI> dif|fus'd thro' the whole Poem; and often|times &s;o well kept up, as to make us forget, that we are reading a Tran&s;la|tion. When we are engag'd in the Piece, do not the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>generous</HI> Sen|timents we meet with perpetually, make a few Thoughts, which have &s;omething <HI>cold</HI> or <HI>little</HI> in them, appear incon&s;iderable
<PB N="8" REF="185">
upon the fir&s;t Compari&s;on? What <HI>Eclairci&s;ements</HI> have we, and how little <HI>Ob&s;curity?</HI> What a number of natural Thoughts, Images, and De&s;criptions might be produc'd, to over-ballance &s;uch Lines in it, as may &s;eem to be Af|fected, or too Artificial?</P>
<P>Thus which ever way we turn our|&s;elves, whether we con&s;ider the <HI>Poetical Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Language,</HI> or the <HI>Ver&s;ification;</HI> in each of them the Beauties far exceed the Defects. It is with this Notion we ought to proceed in our Enquiries: we mu&s;t carry this Thought all along with us. Let us remember <HI>Philyp&s;us,</HI> <Q>That all human Excellence &s;tands merely on Compari&s;on: that no one is without Faults, and that very few arrive in any tolerable degree towards Perfecti|on: That Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> does not only ap|pear among the Few, but that his Su|periority is every way vi&s;ible: If we compare his Compo&s;itions in general with tho&s;e of our other Poets, the Di&s;proportion is as great, as when we compare the Blemi&s;hes of his own Poetry, with the Beauties which every where abound in it.</Q></P>
<P>Some of the&s;e we are now to con&s;ider; and we may enter on this View with the greater Plea&s;ure, as we have the advantage
<PB N="9" REF="186">
of Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> own Ob&s;ervations in &s;e|veral Points, both as to tho&s;e things, in which he met with the greate&s;t difficul|ty; and the Methods he has taken of rai&s;ing his Language, and improving the Ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t Sources of rai&s;ing, as well as enlarging the Poetical Lan|guage, is by inventing New Words, or importing old Ones from a foreign Soil. Words, when they are us'd vulgarly, grow mean: Like other Fa&s;hions, when their u&s;e is once got among the Populace, they &s;oon begin to be rejected by the politer Part of the World. This it is (as <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Art de bien Parler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Part 1. Chap. 4. Sect. 5.</NOTE> the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of <HI>Port Royal</HI> very ju&s;tly ob&s;erve) which nece&s;&s;itates the introducing of New Words into every Language; it occa&s;ions a continual Decay, and demands continual Supplies. Thus whoever has a Felicity this way, is a Benefactor to the Publick: he adds &s;o much to the Bank; and gives his A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in &s;upporting the pre&s;ent Credit of Language among us.</P>

<P>To deviate from the &s;trict Rules which Grammarians wou'd impo&s;e on Words, ei|ther &s;ingle, or as they &s;tand in their relati|ons to one another, gives an agreeable un|common Air to Language; but in the very Notion of it carries &s;omething of diffi|culty, and nicene&s;s along with it.

<P>A thing more u&s;eful and agreeable than either of the&s;e, is to turn the &s;tream of Words out of their common Chan|nel.&mdash;There is a good deal of Stiffne&s;s, which yet attends our Language, from the &s;tated order of Words in &s;uch a re|peated Succe&s;&s;ion: and tho' we are much freer than our Neighbours the <HI>French</HI> in this particular, I &s;hou'd be glad to

<P>I wou'd not have a certain Gramma|rian, or two, over-hear me commending the&s;e Liberties &s;o freely: it wou'd cer|tainly co&s;t one a Di&s;pute.

<P>There is another di&s;agreement in Epi|thets, when two Expre&s;&s;ions, proper in them&s;elves, are yet join'd together im|properly.

<P>An Error yet more frequent is, when we give a word that Epithet, which is proper to it on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, indiffe|rently at all times, and without any Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>This, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, has been al|ways allowable in Ver&s;e: however &s;uch a Liberty is not without its bounds, nor &s;hould it be u&s;ed intemperately. <HI>Purple</HI> (for in&s;tance) is an Epithet very frequent in the Ancient Poets for the Habit of Princes: yet it is not to be given to that of all Great Men; nor of Princes equally,

<P>There may be another Impropriety from the difference of time and circum|&s;tances: It may do very well to give the Epithet of <HI>browzing,</HI> to a Goat; or <HI>gra|zing,</HI> to the Ox: it helps to de&s;cribe them in the Fields, or to di&s;tingui&s;h them from &s;ome other Creatures; and if neither of the&s;e, at lea&s;t it gives the Language a Poetical Air: Yet the&s;e Epithets have &s;ome re&s;traints, they belong to Life and Action; they do not &s;uit with tho&s;e very Creatures, when Dead; and le&s;s &s;o, when they are cut out in the Shambles, or &s;erv'd up at a Fea&s;t: this is the Ca&s;e in a Pa&s;&s;age relating to <HI>Penelope's</HI> Suitors; they,</P>

<P>There is one particular more extreme|ly frequent in <HI>Homer:</HI> it runs thorough all his Works; and is &s;carce once omit|ted, where there is any occa&s;ion for it. I believe your Thoughts outrun me, and might prevent my &s;aying, that I mean His Reflections on the Mi&s;eries of this Life. They are mo&s;tly very emphatical; and lead to a very ea&s;y and u&s;eful infe|rence.</P>

<P>We may ob&s;erve, by the way, that the Heathen Poets, in comparing a Per|&s;on to any of their Deities, had a &s;ure Method of giving their Readers a Picture of that Per&s;on. The Statues of their Deities were known by every one; and the Faces of each as well a&s;certain'd, as the Faces of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors (for in&s;tance) can be, by frequently conver&s;ing with their Medals; This I take to be one Rea&s;on, why this &s;ort of Compari|&s;on is &s;o very frequent in the Ancients: The Ca&s;e is very different in any mo|dern Compo&s;ition; tho' we &s;eem to be equally fond of the &s;ame Compari&s;ons.</P>
<P>If it does not add to the Strength, at lea&s;t it makes the Piece more agreeable, when the&s;e Images are unu&s;ual.

<P>There may be a <HI>Prettine&s;s,</HI> as well as a <HI>Likene&s;s</HI> in the&s;e Images; I always us'd to be pleas'd with that Pa&s;&s;age, where <HI>Penelope</HI> is compar'd to a <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 19, 605&mdash;518.</NOTE> Nightingale;

<P>'Tis the proper air of Poetry to be unconfin'd and free: The Mu&s;e loves a flowing Dre&s;s: Her motions are ever Ea&s;y, and her very ornaments mu&s;t be Natural. Such is the Mu&s;e of <HI>Homer.</HI> And hence the Poet, in this &s;ort of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pictures, does not in the lea&s;t Scruple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to take in &s;everal Circum&s;tances, that do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> not affect the main Re&s;emblance.

<P>Thus in <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Philomel,</HI> the main Likene&s;s is very well taken: When the Poet has &s;ecur'd this, he touches upon the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Itylus;</HI> and launches out into Particulars, which are <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> &tgr;', 523. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> &s;o far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> from &s;quaring with the Ca&s;e of <HI>Penelope,</HI> that they have no manner of Relation to it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="352">
<HI>Homer</HI> is almo&s;t &s;ingular in another &s;ort of Similie, the Rever&s;e of the for|mer: when the Principal Figures have in them&s;elves no Likene&s;s, but agree in &s;ome one Circum&s;tance of Action.

<P>Perhaps this is blameable; and &s;o may be that &s;tringing of &s;everal Similies together, which we &s;ometimes meet with in <HI>Homer.</HI> I do not mean when &s;everal things are cho&s;en to illu&s;trate the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See &Igr;&lgr;. &xgr;, 394.</NOTE> <HI>&s;ame Point</HI> more fully: but when Similies on <HI>different</HI> things follow too clo&s;e on the Neck of one another.

<P>Now I have digre&s;s'd &s;o far on two or three Vices in ancient Similies; I &s;hall ju&s;t mention one or two of a later
<PB N="176" REF="353">

<P>The Art of extracting Similies out of a thing directly contrary to your purpo&s;e, is I think wholly Modern.

<P>Nothing is &s;o oppo&s;ite to the De&s;ign of this Beauty in Poetry, as to labour after a va&s;t Number of Likene&s;&s;es in any the minute&s;t Points; and to multiply

them, rather to &s;hew how far the Poets Wit can carry the Re&s;emblance, than to &s;trengthen the Image of the things de|&s;crib'd.

<P>But whatever Colour Di&s;&s;imulation may bear in the Schemes of Morality, it is certainly a great Excellence to paint

Di&s;&s;imulation well in Poetry. The pre|tended Pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t appear mo&s;t &s;trongly, and yet the real Pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t appear under it.

<P>There is nothing more difficult in Poetry, than to expre&s;s ju&s;tly Ideas in the Minds of Per&s;ons whom we de&s;cribe. But tho' this be the lea&s;t obvious, 'tis perhaps the mo&s;t agreeable of all Studies.

<P>A Man's Notions of Excellence are form'd generally from &s;ome advanc'd Powers of his own. Each Man is apt to make him&s;elf the Mea&s;ure of all the Species; and his Species the Standard of all Perfection. All Beings above him mu&s;t be exactly like the &s;uperior Moyety of his own Being, and all below him mu&s;t be purely of the Inferior. The Vulgar of Mankind form their Heaven hereafter out of tho&s;e things which have pleas'd them mo&s;t in Life; and the very Notions of the Deity in mo&s;t Men take a Turn from their own Complexions. The God of proud <HI>tyrannical</HI> Minds is a Being, that delights only in the <HI>Glory of being Terrible;</HI> as with the &s;oft and piti|ful, The Deity is <HI>all Mercy:</HI> the Gods of <HI>Epicurus</HI> were mere plea&s;urable In|telligences; and the Deities of the <HI>Irro|quois</HI> are <HI>Mighty Hunters.</HI> Commend me to that Philo&s;opher who &s;aid, that <HI>were his Hor&s;e to give us his Notion in this Ca&s;e; A Broad Che&s;t and a Flowing Mane would certainly be the Principal things in it.</HI></P>
<P>One cannot ea&s;ily apprehend how ge|neral an effect this has in the Actings of

our Minds. I know not that it is yet de&s;ignedly manag'd in any Sy&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy, (for Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> of <HI>Ideas</HI> &s;eems to be &s;omething very di&s;tinct from it) and as it wants a Name, give me leave to call it for the pre&s;ent, The <HI>A&s;&s;imilation of Ideas.</HI></P>

<P>There's a Pa&s;&s;age which, I remember, I was mightily pleas'd with formerly, in reading <HI>Cervantes,</HI> without &s;eeing any Rea&s;on for it at that Time; tho' I now imagine, that which took me in it comes under this View. Speaking of <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> the fir&s;t time that Adventurer came in &s;ight of the Ocean, he expre&s;&s;es his Sentiments on this Occa&s;ion in the following manner, <HI>He &s;aw the Sea, which he had never &s;een before; and thought it much bigger than the River at</HI> Salamanca.</P>
<P>This Turn of Thought is not &s;o com|monly ob&s;erv'd perhaps as it might ea&s;ily be in Life. There are other occa&s;ional <HI>Traces</HI> in the Mind, which are known and obvious: Things that are common in &s;ome Degree to all Men; and &s;uch are all tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions which follow from any <HI>Ma&s;ter-Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> One might expa|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ate here very Agreeably on each of them; but I am ever apt to be too Tedious; and will therefore confine my &s;elf to one &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;ion, that of <HI>Fear.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="364">
We may &s;ee in the De&s;criptions of the Poets, how this Pa&s;&s;ion acts on the Soul through all its different Degrees, from a <HI>Wavering</HI> and <HI>Irre&s;olution</HI> of Mind, to the Exce&s;s of <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>De&s;pair.</HI></P>
<P>When a Coward (as mo&s;t Cowards are Vain-glorious) undertakes any En|terprize of Difficulty, the Moment he is engag'd in it, his Mind turns all upon the Danger of the Undertaking. He immediately wi&s;hes him&s;elf fairly out of it; His Body begins to tremble, and his Thoughts are all confus'd and irre&s;olute. Thus it is with <HI>Dolon.</HI> That Wretch engages under the Covert of the Night, to &s;teal to the Camp of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and di&s;cover their Motions.

<P>Fear has another &s;trange Property of <HI>Magnifying</HI> our Ideas of the Danger.

They &s;peak to every the lea&s;t Circum&s;tance; and Rea|ders, who have never thought over this Point, would be &s;urpriz'd to find the great <HI>Cicero</HI> very indu&s;triou&s;ly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ettling Quantities,</HI> and <HI>mea&s;uring Words</HI> fit for &s;uch and &s;uch a Period.

<P>Why, &s;eriou&s;ly, &s;ays <HI>Philyp&s;us,</HI> I have often thought him quite tedious on the&s;e particulars: The Orator, even the Cri|tick, &s;eem'd to be lo&s;t &s;ometimes, and nothing but a mere Pedant appear in their room. I admire the force of Num|bers (continu'd he) as much as any one; but when I have been reading the Rules at large in the Criticks, I could not help thinking them too minute and trifling. If a Man mu&s;t be taken up thus in weighing Syllables and ranging of Vowels, what Elegance of Language can we ex|pect, or what Life in his Compo&s;i|tions?</P>
<P>What you &s;ay (an&s;wer'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> is what, I believe, mo&s;t Men think on this Occa&s;ion: and were a Poet always to be &s;tudying his Rules, &s;uch an Objecti|on would be very powerful: But it is with this, which is only the Mechani&s;m of Ver&s;e, as it is in the Mechani&s;m of Writing.

A Man, who thinks vehemently, will &s;peak &s;wiftly; and when we are on a grave Point, our Words will of them&s;elves be in a great Mea&s;ure &s;low and weighty. This is yet plainer from the <HI>Invention</HI> of Lan|guages; How many &s;ingle Words are there in every Tongue, that have been originally ca&s;t in a proper Mould, and on the fir&s;t Heat carried off the Images of things impre&s;s'd upon them?

Yet has it been often ob&s;erv'd that the Di&s;po&s;itions of a People are per|ceivable in that Turn of Words they chiefly delight in. Thus the <HI>French</HI>

Tongue is brisk and voluble: The <HI>Ger|mans</HI> talk in va&s;t Syllables and perpetual Con&s;onants: <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is neither too &s;oft, nor too rough: tho' our <HI>Northerly</HI> Situa|tion inclines us rather to the latter: And, as the <HI>Spaniard</HI> is the mo&s;t haughty of all Nations, their Language is the mo&s;t Grand; it prides it&s;elf in firm Syl|lables, in a frequency of the fulle&s;t Vowel, and the mo&s;t &s;onorous Termina|tions of its Words.</P>
<P>Nature certainly forms us within for fit Sounds: We &s;ee every Day that even Brutes can expre&s;s their Pa&s;&s;ions by the <HI>Tone</HI> of their Voice; and is not an In|telligent Being as well qualified by Na|ture to adapt Sounds to his Senti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">?</P>
<P>Indeed they are thus adapted already in a Multitude of In&s;tances; Our Lan|guage abounds with &s;uch words; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n many Ca&s;es we need only utter our Sentiments in the mo&s;t common Expre&s;&s;i|ons, to &s;peak with this Significance. What was it that led the fir&s;t Inventors into this frequency of &s;uch words? Was in Art, or the Natural Re&s;emblance, and their Obviou&s;ne&s;s upon that Ac|count? 'Tis in this Light we mu&s;t un|der&s;tand our Ma&s;ter Critick, where he

<P>'Tis plain the U&s;e of Words is arbi|trary: we might if we had a fancy for it, call any thing by any Name: Yet there is &s;omething from within, that has influenc'd all Nations &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ar, as to lead them to de&s;criptive Sounds, in their giving Names to things; and that more fre|quently than one would readily imagine. What Nature has done in &s;ingle Words the Poet carries on in Compo&s;ition; Al|mo&s;t all the particular Names of Sounds them&s;elves, for in&s;tance, are naturally &s;ig|nificant in mo&s;t Languages; as with us, the <HI>Roaring</HI> of Waves, the <HI>Whi&s;tling</HI> of Winds &amp;c. Of &s;uch Words, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a proper &s;tructure of Quantities, and a &s;ig|nificant Cadence of Ver&s;e, the Poet makes an Hurricane by Land, or a Storm at Sea.

Hence it is that this Point takes &s;uch a Compa&s;s in the Doctrine of the Criticks.

<P>I have heard it frequently objected to tho&s;e Gentlemen, the Criticks, that they find out &s;everal Beauties of this Kind in the Works of <HI>Homer,</HI> which he, never &s;o much as dream't of in compo|&s;ing 'em. In many Ca&s;es this may be true; and in many the Lines may be ju&s;tly commended, and really &s;ignificant, tho' that particular Beauty might not be de&s;ign'd in compo&s;ing them: But tho&s;e, who can per&s;wade them&s;elves, that <HI>Ho|mer</HI> never de&s;ign'd any &s;uch thing in his Writings, I &s;hould think, might &s;oon bring them&s;elves to believe (what has been &s;o frequently produc'd as an in&s;tance of Ab&s;urdity) that his Poems might be made by chance.</P>
<P>The Notes of Mu&s;ick in a good Com|po&s;ition are fitted to the Subject: And a good Copy of Ver&s;es wrote for Mu&s;ick will be fitted for Notes. I cannot once doubt, that the fir&s;t Stanza in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Ode for St. <HI>Caecilia</HI>'s Day has a <HI>de&s;ign'd</HI> Harmony all thorough it. 'Tis ju&s;t the &s;ame Ca&s;e with <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poems:

They were all made for Mu&s;ick; and have been all &s;ang to the Lyre.</P>
<P>As for my part, &s;ays <HI>Philyp&s;us,</HI> I find Mu&s;ick enough in them, even now, with|out the Lyri&s;t. Neither have I any quar|rel with the Criticks for giving meplea|&s;ure, and pointing out Beauties of this kind, whether de&s;ign'd by <HI>Homer</HI> or not. But I wonder at one thing: while they &s;peak of the Defect in this point perpe|tually, I never yet heard them &s;peak of any Exce&s;s in it: 'Tis certain, that the greater Number of Poets err in neglect|ing the &s;ignificant Turn of their Ver&s;es: but is there no erring too by an Affecta|tion of it?</P>
<P>I thank you, (an&s;wer'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> for putting me in mind of this particular. Undoubtedly there may be faults on both &s;ides: Even in the Poem before us I ima|gine, this is &s;ometimes carried too far, and &s;ometimes us'd improperly: The In|firmne&s;s of a Couplet, mention'd on ano|ther Occa&s;ion, agrees with the thing de&s;crib'd, and may perhaps be blameable on that very Account.</P>
