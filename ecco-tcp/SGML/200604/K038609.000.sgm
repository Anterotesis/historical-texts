<P>As Mankind, you know, are ever

Do their Maje&s;ties know the Difference of
Weight between Souls and Bodies? How|ever,

a Whi&s;tling&mdash;a Singing&mdash;a Whizzing as
it were in my Head, which I cannot get
rid of&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>From whence all my Di&s;order pro|ceeds&mdash;
I'll tell you my Ca&s;e, Sir&mdash;
You mu&s;t know, I wrote a Play &s;ome time
ago, pre&s;ented a Dedication of it to a certain
young Nobleman&mdash;He approv'd and ac|cepted
of it, but before I could ta&s;te his
Bounty, my Piece was unfortunately damn'd:
&mdash;I lo&s;t my Benefit, nor could I have Re|cour&s;e
to my Patron, for I was told that his
Lord&s;hip play'd the be&s;t Catcall the fir&s;t
Night, and was the merrie&s;t Per&s;on in the

<P>Pray, what do you call damning a
Play?&mdash;</P>

<P>Indeed I am, Sir&mdash;We had no

<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir!&mdash;No Wonder then that
you <HI>Greeks</HI> were &s;uch fine Writers&mdash;It is
impo&s;&s;ible to be de&s;crib'd, or truly felt, but
by the Author him&s;elf&mdash;If you could but
get a Leave of Ab&s;ence from this World for
a few Hours, you might perhaps have an
Opportunity of &s;eeing it your&s;elf&mdash;There is
a Sort of a new Piece comes upon our Stage
this very Night, and I am pretty &s;ure it will
meet with its De&s;erts; at lea&s;t it &s;hall not

the Actors did not &s;peak a Line of

(who writes him&s;elf) &s;truck out all the
Wit and Humour, in order to lower my

deceas'd Play, and its dying Groans, are for

<P>Why, you are in a Pa&s;&s;ion, Friend,
if you would but exert your&s;elf thus at a
proper Time, you might keep the Fox from

<P>Lord, Sir, my Wife has as much

nothing.</P>

<P>What Remedy have you to propo&s;e
for this Misfortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tay.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would propo&s;e to dip my Head in
the River, to wa&s;h away my Fancies&mdash;and if
you'll let me take a few Bottles to my Wife,
if the Water is of a cooling Nature, I may
perhaps be ea&s;y that Way; but I &s;hall do as
your Wor&s;hip plea&s;es.</P>

more, and let your Wife drink to forget your
Unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;A mutual Confidence will &s;uc|ceed,

<P>The Water will cool your Spirit,
