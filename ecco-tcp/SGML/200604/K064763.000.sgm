<P>_THE Vertue, Learning, and good Sen&s;e, which are ac|knowledged to di&s;tingui&s;h Your Character, wou'd tempt me to indulge my|&s;elf the Plea&s;ure Men naturally take, in giving Applau&s;e to tho&s;e, whom they e&s;teem and honour: And it &s;hou'd &s;eem of Importance to the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that they knew, The eminent Share You en|joy in the Favour of Your Sovereign,
<PB REF="3">
and the Honours She has conferred upon You, have not been owing to any Application from Your Lord&s;hip, but entirely to Her Maje&s;ty's own Thought, ari&s;ing from a Sen&s;e of Your Per&s;onal Merit, and an Inclination to reward it. But as Your Name is prefixed to this Treati&s;e, with an Intention to do Ho|nour to my&s;elf alone, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that I am encouraged, by the Favour You have treated me with, to addre&s;s the&s;e Papers to Your Lord&s;hip. And I was the more ambitious of doing this, becau&s;e a Philo&s;ophical Treati&s;e cou'd not &s;o properly be addre&s;&s;ed to any one, as to a Per&s;on of Your Lord&s;hip's Cha|racter, who, to Your other valuable Di&s;tinctions, have added the Know|lege and Reli&s;h of Philo&s;ophy.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THO it &s;eems the general Opi|nion of the World, no le&s;s than the De&s;ign of Nature and Pro|vidence, that the End of Spe|culation be Practice, or the Im|provement and Regulation of our Lives and Actions; Yet tho&s;e, who are mo&s;t addicted to &s;peculative Studies, &s;eem as generally of another Mind. And, indeed, if we con&s;ider the Pains that have been taken, to perplex the plaine&s;t Things, that Di&s;tru&s;t of the Sen&s;es, tho&s;e Doubts and Scruples, tho&s;e Ab&s;tractions and Refinements that occurr in the very Entrance of the Sciences; it will not &s;eem &s;trange, that Men of Lei&s;ure and Curio|&s;ity
<PB REF="5">
&s;hou'd lay them&s;elves out in fruitle&s;s Di&s;|qui&s;itions, without de&s;cending to the practical Parts of Life, or informing them&s;elves in the more nece&s;&s;ary and important Parts of Know|lege.</P>
<P>Upon the common Principles of Philo&s;ophers, we are not a&s;&s;ured of the Exi&s;tence of Things from their being perceived. And we are taught to di&s;tingui&s;h their real Nature from that which falls under our Sen&s;es. Hence ari&s;e <HI>Sceptici&s;m</HI> and <HI>Paradoxes.</HI> It is not enough, that we &s;ee and feel, that we ta&s;te and &s;mell a thing. Its true Nature, its ab&s;olute external Entity, is &s;till concealed. For, tho it be the Fiction of our own Brain, we have made it inacce&s;&s;ible to all our Faculties. Sen&s;e is fallacious, Rea&s;on defe|ctive. We &s;pend our Lives in doubting of tho&s;e things which other Men evidently know, and believing tho&s;e things which they laugh at, and de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to divert the bu&s;y Mind of Man from vain Re&s;earches, it &s;eemed nece&s;|&s;ary to inquire into the Source of its Perplexi|ties; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to lay down &s;uch Prin|ciples, as, by an ea&s;y Solution of them, together with their own native Evidence, may, at once, recommend them&s;elves for Genuine to the Mind, and re&s;cue it from tho&s;e endle&s;s Pur&s;uits it is engaged in. Which, with a plain Demon&s;tra|tion
<PB REF="6">
of the immediate Providence of an All|&s;eeing GOD, and the natural Immortality of the Soul, &s;hou'd &s;eem the readie&s;t Preparation, as well as the &s;tronge&s;t Motive, to the Study and Practice of Vertue.</P>
<P>This De&s;ign I propo&s;ed, in the Fir&s;t Part of a Treati&s;e concerning the <HI>Principles of Hu|mane Knowledge,</HI> publi&s;hed in the Year <HI>1710.</HI> But, before I proceed to publi&s;h the Second Part, I thought it requi&s;ite to treat more clearly and fully of certain Principles laid down in the Fir&s;t, and to place them in a new Light. Which is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the following <HI>Dialogues.</HI></P>
<P>In this Treati&s;e, which does not pre&s;uppo&s;e in the Reader, any Knowledge of what was contained in the former, it has been my Aim to introduce the Notions I advance, into the Mind, in the mo&s;t ea&s;y and familiar manner; e&s;pecial|ly, becau&s;e they carry with them a great Oppo|&s;ition to the Prejudices of Philo&s;ophers, which have &s;o far prevailed again&s;t the common Sen&s;e and natural Notions of Mankind.</P>
<P>If the Principles, which I here endeavour to propagate, are admitted for true; the Con&s;e|quences which, I think, evidently flow from thence, are, that <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> and <HI>Sceptici&s;m</HI> will be utterly de&s;troyed, many intricate Points made plain, great Difficulties &s;olved, &s;everal u&s;ele&s;s
<PB REF="7">
Parts of Science retrenched, Speculation referred to Practice, and Men reduced from Paradoxes to common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>And altho it may, perhaps, &s;eem an unea&s;y Reflexion to &s;ome, that when they have taken a Circuit thorow &s;o many refined and unvulgar Notions, they &s;hou'd at la&s;t come to think like o|ther Men: Yet, methinks, this Return to the &s;imple Dictates of Nature, after having wan|dered thorow the wild Mazes of Philo&s;ophy, is not unplea&s;ant. It is like coming home from a long Voyage: A Man reflects with Plea&s;ure on the many Difficulties and Perplexities he has pa&s;&s;ed thorow, &s;ets his Heart at ea&s;e, and enjoys him&s;elf with more Satisfaction for the future.</P>
<P>As it was my Intention to convince <HI>Sceptics</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> by Rea&s;on, &s;o it has been my Endea|vor &s;trictly to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t rigid Laws of Rea&s;oning. And, to an impartial Reader, I hope, it will be manife&s;t, that the &s;ublime No|tion of a GOD, and the comfortable Expecta|tion of Immortality, do naturally ari&s;e from a clo&s;e and methodical Application of Thought: Whatever may be the Re&s;ult of that loo&s;e, ram|bling Way, not altogether improperly termed <HI>Free-thinking,</HI> by certain Libertines in Thought, who can no more endure the Re&s;traints of <HI>Logic,</HI> than tho&s;e of <HI>Religion,</HI> or <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="8">
It will, perhaps, be objected to my De&s;ign, that &s;o far as it tends to ea&s;e the Mind of dif|ficult and u&s;ele&s;s Inquiries, it can affect only a few &s;peculative Per&s;ons; but, if by their Spe|culations rightly placed, the Study of Morality and the Law of Nature were brought more in|to Fa&s;hion among Men of Parts and Genius, the Di&s;couragements that draw to <HI>Sceptici&s;m</HI> removed, the Mea&s;ures of Right and Wrong accurately defined, and the Principles of Natu|ral Religion reduced into regular Sy&s;tems, as artfully di&s;po&s;ed and clearly connected as tho&s;e of &s;ome other Sciences: There are grounds to think, the&s;e Effects wou'd not only have a gra|dual Influence in repairing the too much defa|ced Sen&s;e of Vertue in the World; but al&s;o, by &s;hewing, that &s;uch Parts of Revelation, as lie within the reach of Humane Inquiry, are mo&s;t agreeable to Right Rea&s;on, wou'd di&s;po&s;e all prudent, unprejudiced Per&s;ons, to a mode&s;t and wary Treatment of tho&s;e Sacred My&s;teries, which are above the Comprehen&s;ion of our Fa|culties.</P>
<P>It remains, that I de&s;ire the Reader to with|hold his Cen&s;ure of the&s;e Dialogues, till he has read them thorow. Otherwi&s;e, he may lay them a&s;ide in a Mi&s;take of their De&s;ign, or on account of Difficulties or Objections which he wou'd find an&s;wered in the Sequel. A Treati&s;e of this Na|ture
<PB REF="9">
wou'd require to be once read over cohe|rently, in order to comprehend its De&s;ign, the Proofs, Solution of Difficulties, and the Con|nexion and Di&s;po&s;ition of its Parts. If it be thought to de&s;erve a Second Reading; this, I imagine, will make the intire Scheme very plain: E&s;pecially, if Recour&s;e be had to an E&s;&s;ay I wrote, &s;ome Years &s;ince, upon <HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> and the Treati&s;e concerning the <HI>Principles of Humane Knowlege.</HI> Wherein divers Notions advan|ced in the&s;e <HI>Dialogues,</HI> are farther pur&s;ued, or placed in different Lights, and other Points handled, which naturally tend to confirm and illu&s;trate them.</P>

<P>_GOOD Morrow, <HI>Hylas,</HI> I did not expect to find you abroad &s;o early.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hylas.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in|deed &s;omething unu&s;ual, but my Thoughts were &s;o taken up with a Sub|ject I was di&s;cour&s;ing of la&s;t Night, that finding I could not &s;leep, I re&s;olved to ri&s;e and take a turn in the Garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It happened well, to let you &s;ee what innocent and agreeable Plea&s;ures you lo&s;e every Morning. Can there be a plea&s;anter time of the Day, or a more delightful Sea|&s;on of the Year? That purple Sky, the&s;e wild but &s;weet Notes of Birds, the fra|grant Bloom upon the Trees and Flowers, the gentle Influence of the ri&s;ing Sun, the&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="11">
and a thou&s;and namele&s;s Beauties of Nature in&s;pire the Soul with &s;ecret Tran&s;ports; its Faculties too being at this time fre&s;h and lively, are fit for tho&s;e Meditations, which the Solitude of a Garden and Tranquillity of the Morning naturally di&s;po&s;e us to. But I am afraid I interrupt your Thoughts: for you &s;eemed very intent on &s;omething.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, I was, and &s;hall be obliged to you if you will permit me to go on in the &s;ame Vein; not that I would by any means deprive my&s;elf of your Company, for my Thoughts always flow more ea&s;ily in Conver|&s;ation with a Friend, than when I am alone: But my Reque&s;t is, that you would &s;uffer me to impart my Reflexions to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, it is what I &s;hould have reque&s;ted my &s;elf, if you had not pre|vented me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was con&s;idering the odd Fate of tho&s;e Men who have in all Ages, through an Affectation of being di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Vulgar, or &s;ome unaccountable Turn of Thought, pretended either to believe no|thing at all, or to believe the mo&s;t extrava|gant Things in the World. This however might be born, if their Paradoxes and Scepti|ci&s;m did not draw after them &s;ome Con&s;e|quences of general Di&s;advantage to Man|kind. But the Mi&s;chief lies here; that when Men of le&s;s Lei&s;ure &s;ee them who are &s;uppo|&s;ed
<PB N="3" REF="12">
to have &s;pent their whole time in the Pur&s;uits of Knowlege, profe&s;&s;ing an intire Ignorance of all Things, or advancing &s;uch Notions as are repugnant to plain and com|monly received Principles, they will be tempted to entertain Su&s;picions concerning the mo&s;t important Truths which they had hitherto held &s;acred and unque&s;tionable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I intirely agree with you, as to the ill Tendency of the affected Doubts of &s;ome Philo&s;ophers, and fanta&s;tical Conceits of o|thers. I am even &s;o far gone of late in this way of Thinking, that I have quitted &s;everal of the &s;ublime Notions I had got in their Schools for vulgar Opinions. And I give it you on my Word, &s;ince this Revolt from Me|taphy&s;ical Notions to the plain Dictates of Nature and common Sen&s;e, I find my Un|der&s;tanding &s;trangely enlightened, &s;o that I can now ea&s;ily comprehend a great many Things which before were all My&s;tery and Riddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to find there was nothing in the Accounts I heard of you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what were tho&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were repre&s;ented in la&s;t Night's Conver&s;ation, as one who maintained the mo&s;t extravagant Opinion that ever entered into the Mind of Man, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is no &s;uch Thing as <HI>material Sub&s;tance</HI> in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That there is no &s;uch Thing as what Philo&s;ophers call <HI>Material Sub&s;tance,</HI> I am &s;e|riou&s;ly per&s;uaded: But if I were made to &s;ee any thing Ab&s;urd or Sceptical in this, I &s;hould then have the &s;ame Rea&s;on to renounce this, that I imagine I have now to reject the con|trary Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! can any Thing be more fan|ta&s;tical, more repugnant to common Sen&s;e, or a more manife&s;t Piece of Sceptici&s;m, than to believe there is no &s;uch Thing as <HI>Matter?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly, good <HI>Hylas.</HI> What if it &s;hould prove, that you, who hold there is, are by Vertue of that Opinion a greater <HI>Sceptic,</HI> and maintain more Paradoxes and Repug|nancies to common Sen&s;e, than I who be|lieve no &s;uch Thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may as &s;oon per&s;uade me, The Part is greater than the Whole, as that, in order to avoid Ab&s;urdity and Sceptici&s;m, I &s;hould ever be obliged to give up my Opi|nion in this Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, are you content to admit that Opinion for true, which upon Examina|tion &s;hall appear mo&s;t agreeable to common Sen&s;e, and remote from Sceptici&s;m?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart. Since you are for rai&s;ing Di&s;putes about the plaine&s;t Things in Nature, I am content for once to hear what you have to &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, <HI>Hylas,</HI> what do you mean by a <HI>Sceptic?</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean what all Men mean, one that doubts of every Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He then who entertains no Doubt concerning &s;ome particular Point, with re|gard to that Point, cannot be thought a <HI>Sceptic.</HI></P>

<P>I agree with you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether does Doubting con&s;i&s;t in embracing the Affirmative or Negative Side of a Que&s;tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>In neither; for whoever under&s;tands <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> cannot but know that <HI>Doubting</HI> &s;ig|nifies a Su&s;pen&s;e between both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He then that denies any Point, can no more be &s;aid to doubt of it, than he who affirms it with the &s;ame Degree of A&s;&s;u|rance.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>

<P>I acknowlege it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How comes it then, <HI>Hylas,</HI> that you pronounce me a <HI>Sceptic,</HI> becau&s;e I deny what you affirm, <HI>viz.</HI> the Exi&s;tence of Matter? Since, for ought you can tell, I am as perem|ptory in my Denial, as you in your Affirma|tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="15">
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I have been a lit|tle out in my Definition; but every fal&s;e Step a Man makes in Di&s;cour&s;e is not to be in&s;i&s;ted on. I &s;aid, indeed, that a <HI>Sceptic</HI> was one who doubted of every Thing; but I &s;hould have added, or who denies the Reality and Truth of Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Things? Do you mean the Principles and Theoremes of Sciences? But the&s;e you know are univer&s;al intellectual No|tions, and con&s;equently independent of Mat|ter; the Denial therefore of this doth not im|ply the denying them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it. But are there no other Things? What think you of di&s;tru&s;ting the Sen&s;es, of denying the real Exi&s;tence of &s;en|&s;ible Things, or pretending to know nothing of them. Is not this &s;ufficient to denominate a Man a <HI>Sceptic?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall we therefore examine which of us it is that denies the Reality of Sen&s;ible Things, or profe&s;&s;es the greate&s;t Ignorance of them; &s;ince, if I take you rightly, he is to be e&s;teemed the greate&s;t <HI>Sceptic?</HI></P>

<P>What mean you by Sen&s;ible Things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e Things which are perceived by the Sen&s;es. Can you imagine that I mean any thing el&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, <HI>Hylas,</HI> if I am de&s;irous clearly to apprehend your Notions, &s;ince this
<PB N="7" REF="16">
may much &s;horten our Inquiry. Suffer me then to ask you this farther Que&s;tion. Are tho&s;e Things only perceived by the Sen&s;es which are perceived immediately? Or may tho&s;e Things properly be &s;aid to be <HI>Sen&s;ible,</HI> which are perceived mediately, or not with|out the Intervention of others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ufficiently under&s;tand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In reading a Book, what I immediate|ly perceive are the Letters, but mediately, or by means of the&s;e, are &s;ugge&s;ted to my Thoughts the Notions of God, Virtue, Truth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now, that the Letters are truly Sen&s;i|ble Things, or perceived by Sen&s;e, there is no doubt: But I would know whether you take the Things &s;ugge&s;ted by them to be &s;o too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No certainly, it were ab&s;urd to think <HI>God</HI> or <HI>Virtue</HI> Sen&s;ible Things, tho' they may be &s;ignified and &s;ugge&s;ted to the Mind by Sen&s;ible Marks, with which they have an arbitrary Connexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems then, that by <HI>Sen&s;ible Things</HI> you mean tho&s;e only which can be perceived immediately by Sen&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does it not follow from this, that tho' I &s;ee one part of the Sky Red, and ano|ther Blue, and that my Rea&s;on doth thence evidently conclude there mu&s;t be &s;ome Cau&s;e of that Diver&s;ity of Colours, yet that Cau&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="17">
cannot be &s;aid to be a Sen&s;ible Thing, or perceived by the Sen&s;e of Seeing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In like manner, tho' I hear Variety of Sounds, yet I cannot be &s;aid to hear the Cau&s;es of tho&s;e Sounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when by my Touch I perceive a thing to be hot and heavy, I cannot &s;ay with any Truth or Propriety, that I feel the Cau&s;e of its Heat or Weight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To prevent any more Que&s;tions of this kind, I tell you once for all, that by <HI>Sen&s;ible Things</HI> I mean tho&s;e only which are perceived by Sen&s;e, and that in truth the Sen&s;es perceive nothing which they do not perceive immediately: for they make no Infe|rences. The Deducing therefore of Cau&s;es or Occa&s;ions from Effects and Appearances, which alone are perceived by Sen&s;e, intirely relates to Rea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Point then is agreed between us, That <HI>&s;en&s;ible things are tho&s;e only which are immediately perceived by Sen&s;e.</HI> You will farther inform me, whether we immediately perceive by Sight, any thing be&s;ide Light, and Colours, and Figures: or by Hearing, any thing but Sounds: by the Palate, any thing be&s;ide Ta&s;tes: by the Smell, be&s;ide Odors: or by the Touch, more than tangible Quali|ties.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="18">
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>We do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems, therefore, that if you take away all &s;en&s;ible Qualities, there remains no|thing &s;en&s;ible.</P>

<P>Does the Reality of &s;en&s;ible things con&s;i&s;t in being perceived? or, is it &s;ome|thing di&s;tinct from their being perceived, and that bears no relation to the Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To <HI>exi&s;t</HI> is one thing, and to be <HI>per|ceived</HI> is another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;peak with regard to &s;en&s;ible things only: And of the&s;e I ask, Whether by their real Exi&s;tence you mean a Sub&s;i&s;tence exte|rior to the Mind, and di&s;tinct from their being perceived?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean a real, ab&s;olute Being, di&s;tinct from, and without any relation to, their be|ing perceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heat, therefore, if it be allowed a real Being, mu&s;t exi&s;t without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It mu&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me, <HI>Hylas,</HI> is this real Exi&s;tence equally compatible to all Degrees of Heat, which we perceive: or, is there any Rea&s;on
<PB N="10" REF="19">
why we &s;hould attribute it to &s;ome, and de|ny it others? And if there be, pray let me know that Rea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever Degree of Heat we per|ceive by Sen&s;e, we may be &s;ure, the &s;ame exi&s;ts in the Object that occa&s;ions it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, the greate&s;t as well as the lea&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, the Rea&s;on is plainly the &s;ame in re&s;pect of both: They are both perceived by Sen&s;e; nay, the greater Degree of Heat is more &s;en&s;ibly perceived; and, con|&s;equently, if there is any Difference, we are more certain of its real Exi&s;tence than we can be of the Reality of a le&s;&s;er Degree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not the mo&s;t vehement and inten&s;e Degree of Heat a very great Pain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No one can deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, is any unperceiving thing ca|pable of Pain or Plea&s;ure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is your material Sub&s;tance a &s;en&s;le&s;s Being, or a Being endowed with Sen&s;e and Perception?</P>

<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;en&s;le&s;s, without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It cannot, therefore, be the Subject of Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor, con&s;equently, of the greate&s;t Heat perceived by Sen&s;e, &s;ince you acknow|lege this to be no &s;mall Pain.</P>
</SP>

<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay then of your ex|ternal Object; is it a material Sub&s;tance, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a material Sub&s;tance with the &s;en&s;ible Qualities inhering in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then can a great Heat exi&s;t in it, &s;ince you own, it cannot in a material Sub&s;tance? I de&s;ire you wou'd clear this Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I fear I was out in yielding inten&s;e Heat to be a Pain. It &s;hou'd &s;eem rather, that Pain is &s;omething di&s;tinct from Heat, and the Con&s;equence or Effect of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon putting your Hand near the Fire, do you perceive one &s;imple, uniform Sen&s;ation, or two di&s;tinct Sen&s;ations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But one &s;imple Sen&s;ation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not the Heat immediately per|ceived?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Pain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seeing, therefore, they are both im|mediately perceived at the &s;ame time, and the Fire affects you only with one &s;imple, or uncompounded Idea, it follows, that this &s;ame &s;imple Idea is both the inten&s;e Heat im|mediately perceived, and the Pain; and, con|&s;equently, that the inten&s;e Heat immediately
<PB N="12" REF="21">
perceived, is nothing di&s;tinct from a particu|lar &s;ort of Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, try in your Thoughts, <HI>Hylas,</HI> if you can conceive a vehement Sen&s;ation to be without Pain, or Plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or, can you frame to your&s;elf an Idea of &s;en&s;ible Pain or Plea&s;ure in general, ab&s;tracted from every particular Idea of Heat, Cold, Ta&s;tes, Smells? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;I do not find that I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does it not, therefore, follow, that &s;en&s;ible Pain is nothing di&s;tinct from tho&s;e Sen&s;ations, or Ideas, in an inten&s;e Degree?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is undeniable; and to &s;peak the Truth, I begin to &s;u&s;pect, a very great Heat cannot exi&s;t but in a Mind perceiving it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! are you then in that <HI>Sceptical</HI> State of Su&s;pen&s;e, between Affirming and Denying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I may be po&s;itive in the Point. A very violent and painful Heat cannot exi&s;t without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has not, therefore, according to you, any real Being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it, therefore, certain, that there is no body in Nature really hot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not denied there is any real Heat in Bodies. I only &s;ay, there is no &s;uch thing as an inten&s;e real Heat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="22">
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, did you not &s;ay before, that all Degrees of Heat were equally real: or, if there was any difference, that the Greater were more undoubtedly real than the Le&s;&s;er?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True: But it was, becau&s;e I did not then con&s;ider the Ground there is for di&s;tin|gui&s;hing between them, which I now plainly &s;ee. And it is this: Becau&s;e inten&s;e Heat is nothing el&s;e but a particular kind of painful Sen&s;ation; and Pain cannot exi&s;t but in a perceiving Being; it follows, that no inten&s;e Heat can really exi&s;t in an unperceiving cor|poreal Sub&s;tance. But this is no Rea&s;on, why we &s;hould deny Heat in an inferior Degree, to exi&s;t in &s;uch a Sub&s;tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, how &s;hall we be able to di&s;cern tho&s;e Degrees of Heat which exi&s;t only in the Mind, from tho&s;e which exi&s;t without it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is no difficult matter. You know, the lea&s;t Pain cannot exi&s;t unperceived; what|ever, therefore, Degree of Heat is a Pain, exi&s;ts only in the Mind. But, as for all other Degrees of Heat, nothing obliges us to think the &s;ame of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you granted before, that no unperceiving Being was capable of Plea&s;ure, any more than of Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, is not Warmth, or a more gen|tle Degree of Heat than what cau&s;es Unea&s;i|ne&s;s, a Plea&s;ure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="23">
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Con&s;equently, it cannot exi&s;t with|out the Mind in any unperceiving Sub&s;tance, or Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it &s;eems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since therefore, as well tho&s;e Degrees of Heat that are not painful, as tho&s;e that are, can exi&s;t only in a Thinking Sub&s;tance, may we not conclude, that external Bodies are ab&s;olutely incapable of any Degree of Heat what&s;oever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>On &s;econd Thoughts, I do not think it &s;o evident that Warmth is a Plea&s;ure, as that a great Degree of Heat is a Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not pretend, that Warmth is as great a Plea&s;ure as Heat is a Pain. But if you grant it to be even a &s;mall Plea&s;ure, it &s;erves to make good my Conclu&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd rather call it an <HI>Indolence.</HI> It &s;eems to be nothing more than a Priva|tion of both Pain and Plea&s;ure. And that &s;uch a Quality or State as this may agree to an unthinking Sub&s;tance, I hope you will not deny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are re&s;olved to maintain that Warmth, or a gentle Degree of Heat, is no Plea&s;ure, I know not how to convince you otherwi&s;e, than by appealing to your own Sen&s;e. But what think you of Cold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ame that I do of Heat. An in|ten&s;e Degree of Cold is a Pain; for to feel
<PB N="15" REF="24">
a very great Cold, is to perceive a great Un|ea&s;ine&s;s: It cannot, therefore, exi&s;t without the Mind; but a le&s;&s;er Degree of Cold may, as well as a le&s;&s;er Degree of Heat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e Bodies, therefore, upon who&s;e Application to our own, we perceive a mode|rate Degreee of Heat, mu&s;t be concluded to have a moderate Degree of Heat or Warmth in them: And tho&s;e, upon who&s;e Applica|tion we feel a like Degree of Cold, mu&s;t be thought to have Cold in them.</P>

<P>It is.</P>

<P>When a Pin pricks your Finger, does it not rend and divide the Fibres of your Fle&s;h?</P>

<P>Since, therefore, you neither judge the Sen&s;ation it&s;elf occa&s;ioned by the Pin, nor any thing like it to be in the Pin; you &s;houl'd not, conformably to what you have now granted, judge the Sen&s;ation, occa&s;ioned by the Fire, or any thing like it, to be in the Fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, I am con|tent to yield this Point, and acknowlege, that Heat and Cold are only Sen&s;ations exi|&s;ting in our Minds: But there &s;till remain Qualities enough to &s;ecure the Reality of external Things.</P>

<SP>

<P>Let us examine them in Order. What think you of Ta&s;tes, do they exi&s;t without the Mind, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can any Man in his Sen&s;es doubt whether Sugar is &s;weet, or Wormwood bit|ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inform me, <HI>Hylas.</HI> Is a &s;weet Ta&s;te a particular kind of Plea&s;ure or plea&s;ant Sen|&s;ation, or is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not Bitterne&s;s &s;ome kind of Unea&s;ine&s;s or Pain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If, therefore, Sugar and Wormwood are unthinking corporeal Sub&s;tances exi&s;ting without the Mind, how can Sweetne&s;s and Bitterne&s;s, that is, Plea&s;ure and Pain, agree to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I now &s;ee what it was deluded me all this time. You asked whether Heat and Cold, Sweetne&s;s and Bit|terne&s;s, were not particular Sorts of Plea|&s;ure and Pain; to which I an&s;wered &s;imply,
<PB N="18" REF="27">
that they were. Whereas I &s;hould have thus di&s;tingui&s;hed: Tho&s;e Qualities, as perceived by us, are Plea&s;ures or Pains, but not as exi&s;t|ing in the external Objects. We mu&s;t not therefore conclude ab&s;olutely, that there is no Heat in the Fire, or Sweetne&s;s in the Sugar, but only that Heat or Sweetne&s;s, as perceived by us, are not in the Fire or Sugar. What &s;ay you to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay it is nothing to the Purpo&s;e. Our Di&s;cour&s;e proceeded altogether concern|ing Sen&s;ible Things, which you defined to be the Things we <HI>immediately perceive by our Sen&s;es.</HI> Whatever other Qualities, therefore, you &s;peak of, as di&s;tinct from the&s;e, I know nothing of them, neither do they at all be|long to the Point in Di&s;pute. You may, in|deed, pretend to have di&s;covered certain Qualities which you do not perceive, and a&s;|&s;ert tho&s;e in&s;en&s;ible Qualities exi&s;t in Fire and Sugar. But, what U&s;e can be made of this to your pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, I am at a Lo&s;s to conceive. Tell me then once more, do you acknowlege that Heat and Cold, Sweet|ne&s;s and Bitterne&s;s, (meaning tho&s;e Qualities which are perceived by the Sen&s;es) do not exi&s;t without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee it is to no purpo&s;e to hold out, &s;o I give up the Cau&s;e as to tho&s;e mentioned Qualities: Though I profe&s;s it &s;ounds odly, to &s;ay that Sugar is not &s;weet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="28">
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for your farther Satisfaction, take this along with you: That which at other times &s;eems &s;weet, &s;hall, to a di&s;tempered Pa|late, appear bitter. And nothing can be plainer, than that divers Per&s;ons perceive dif|ferent Ta&s;tes in the &s;ame Food, &s;ince that which one Man delights in, another abhors. And how could this be, if the Ta&s;te was &s;omething really inherent in the Food?</P>

<P>I acknowlege I know not how.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the next place, Odors are to be con|&s;idered. And with regard to the&s;e, I would fain know, whether what has been &s;aid of Ta&s;tes does not exactly agree to them? Are they not &s;o many plea&s;ing or di&s;plea&s;ing Sen|&s;ations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are.</P>
</SP>

<P>Can you then conceive it po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould exi&s;t in an unperceiving Thing?</P>
</SP>

<P>I cannot.</P>

<P>By no means.</P>

<P>Then as to Sounds, what mu&s;t we think of them: Are they Accidents really in|herent in external Bodies, or not?</P>

<P>That they inhere not in the &s;onorous Bodies, is plain from hence; becau&s;e a Bell &s;truck in the exhau&s;ted Receiver of an Air-Pump, &s;ends forth no Sound. The Air, therefore, mu&s;t be thought the Subject of Sound.</P>

<P>Becau&s;e when any Motion is rai&s;ed in the Air, we perceive a Sound greater or le&s;|&s;er, in Proportion to the Air's Motion; but without &s;ome Motion in the Air, we never hear any Sound at all.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is this very Motion in the external Air, that produces in the Mind the Sen&s;ation of <HI>Sound.</HI> For, &s;triking on the Drum of the Air, it cau&s;es a Vibration, which by the Au|ditory Nerves being communicated to the Brain, the Soul is thereupon affected with the Sen&s;ation called <HI>Sound.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! is Sound then a Sen&s;ation?</P>
</SP>

<P>You mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h, <HI>Philonous,</HI> be|tween Sound as it is perceived by us, and as it is in it&s;elf; or (which is the &s;ame thing) between the Sound we immediately perceive, and that which exi&s;ts without us.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a Micro&s;cope often di&s;covers Co|lours in an Object different from tho&s;e per|ceived by the una&s;&s;i&s;ted Sight.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, what will you conclude from all this? You cannot argue, that there are really and naturally no Colours on Objects: becau&s;e, by artificial Managements they may be altered, or made to vani&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it may evidently be concluded from your own Conce&s;&s;ions, that all the Co|lours we &s;ee with our naked Eyes, are only apparent as tho&s;e on the Clouds, &s;ince they vani&s;h upon a more clo&s;e and accurate In|&s;pection, which is afforded us by a Micro|&s;cope. Then, as to what you &s;ay by way of Prevention: I ask you, whether the real and natural State of an Object is better di&s;covered by a very &s;harp and piercing Sight, or by one which is le&s;s &s;harp?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the former, without doubt.</P>

<P>Con&s;equently, the Micro&s;copical Re|pre&s;entation is to be thought that which be&s;t &s;ets forth the real Nature of the Thing, or what it is in it&s;elf. The Colours, therefore, by it perceived, are more genuine and real, than tho&s;e perceived otherwi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s, there is &s;omething in what you &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is not only po&s;&s;ible, but manife&s;t, that there actually are Animals, who&s;e Eyes are by Nature framed to per|ceive tho&s;e things, which, by rea&s;on of their Minutene&s;s, e&s;cape our Sight. What think you of tho&s;e inconceivably &s;mall Animals, perceived by Gla&s;&s;es? Mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e they are all &s;tark blind? or, in ca&s;e they &s;ee, can it be imagined, their Sight has not the &s;ame U&s;e in pre&s;erving their Bodies from Injuries, which appears in That of all other Animals? and if it hath, is it not evident, they mu&s;t &s;ee Particles le&s;s than their own Bodies, which will pre&s;ent them with a far different View in each Object, from that which &s;trikes our Sen|&s;es? Even our own Eyes do not always re|pre&s;ent Objects to us after the &s;ame manner. In the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> every one knows that all things &s;eem yellow. Is it not, therefore,
<PB N="28" REF="41">
highly probable, tho&s;e Animals, in who&s;e Eyes we di&s;cern a very different Texture from that of ours, and who&s;e Bodies abound with different Humors, do not &s;ee the &s;ame Colours in every Object that we do? From all which, &s;hou'd it not &s;eem to follow, that all Colours are equally apparent, and that none of tho&s;e which we perceive are really inherent in any outward Object?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;hou'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Point will be pa&s;t all doubt, if you con&s;ider, that in ca&s;e Colours were real Properties or Affections inherent in external Bodies, they cou'd admit of no Alteration, without &s;ome Change wrought in the very Bodies them&s;elves: But, is it not evident from what has been &s;aid, that, upon the U&s;e of Micro&s;copes, upon a Change happening in the Humors of the Eye, or a Variation of Di&s;tance, without any manner of real Alte|ration in the Thing it&s;elf, the Colours of any Object are either changed, or totally di&s;ap|pear? Nay, all other Circum&s;tances remain|ing the &s;ame, change but the Situation of &s;ome Objects, and they &s;hall pre&s;ent different Colours to the Eye. The &s;ame thing hap|pens upon viewing an Object in various De|grees of Light. And what is more known, than that the &s;ame Bodies appear differently coloured by Candle-light, from what they do in the open Day? Add to the&s;e, the Ex|periment
<PB N="29" REF="42">
of a Pri&s;m, which, &s;eparating the heterogeneous Rays of Light, alters the Co|lour of any Object; and will cau&s;e the White&s;t to appear of a deep Blue, or Red, to the na|ked Eye. And now tell me, whether you are &s;till of Opinion, that every Body has its true real Colour inhering in it; and if you think it has, I would fain know farther from you, what certain Di&s;tance and Po&s;ition of the Object, what peculiar Texture and For|mation of the Eye, what Degree or Kind of Light is nece&s;&s;ary for a&s;certaining that true Colour, and di&s;tingui&s;hing it from apparent ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own my&s;elf intirely &s;atisfied, that they are all equally apparent; and that there is no &s;uch thing as Colour really inhering in external Bodies, but that it is altogether in the Light. And what confirms me in this Opinion is, that in proportion to the Light, Colours are &s;till more or le&s;s vivid; and if there be no Light, then are there no Colours perceived. Be&s;ides, allowing there are Co|lours on external Objects, yet, how is it po&s;|&s;ible for us to perceive them? For no exter|nal Body affects the Mind, unle&s;s it act fir&s;t on our Organs of Sen&s;e. But the only Action of Bodies is Motion; and Motion cannot be communicated otherwi&s;e than by Impul&s;e. A di&s;tant Object, therefore, can|not act on the Eye, nor, con&s;equently, make
<PB N="30" REF="43">
it&s;elf, or its Properties perceivable to the Soul. Whence it plainly follows, that it is immediately &s;ome contiguous Sub&s;tance, which operating on the Eye, occa&s;ions a Perception of Colours: And &s;uch is Light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! is Light then a Sub&s;tance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, <HI>Philonous,</HI> external Light is nothing but a thin, fluid Sub&s;tance, who&s;e minute Particles being agitated with a brisk Motion, and in various Manners reflected from the different Surfaces of outward Ob|jects to the Eyes, communicate different Mo|tions to the Optick Nerves; which being pro|pagated to the Brain, cau&s;e therein various Impre&s;&s;ions: And the&s;e are attended with the Sen&s;ations of Red, Blue, Yellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;pute about them; only I would advi&s;e you to think, whether, con&s;idering the Inquiry we are up|on, it be prudent for you to affirm, <HI>the Red and Blue which we &s;ee are not real Colours, but certain unknown Motions and Figures which no Man ever did or can &s;ee are truly &s;o.</HI> Are not the&s;e &s;hocking Notions, and are not they &s;ubject to as many ridiculous Inferences, as tho&s;e you before renounced in the Ca&s;e of Sounds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I frankly own, <HI>Philonous,</HI> that it is in vain to &s;tand out any longer. Colours, Sounds, Ta&s;tes, in a word, all tho&s;e term|ed <HI>Secondary Qualities,</HI> have certainly no Exi&s;tence without the Mind. But by this
<PB N="32" REF="45">
Acknowlegement, I mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to derogate any thing from the Reality of Mat|ter, or external Objects, &s;eeing it is no more than &s;everal Philo&s;ophers maintain, who ne|verthele&s;s are the farthe&s;t imaginable from de|nying Matter. For the clearer Under&s;tanding of this, you mu&s;t know, &s;en&s;ible Qualities are by Philo&s;ophers divided into <HI>Primary</HI> and <HI>Se|condary.</HI> The former are Exten&s;ion, Figure, Solidity, Gravity, Motion, and Re&s;t; and the&s;e they hold exi&s;t really in Bodies. The latter are tho&s;e above enumerated; or, briefly, all &s;en&s;ible Qualities be&s;ide, the Primary, which they a&s;&s;ert are only &s;o many Sen&s;a|tions or Ideas exi&s;ting no where but in the Mind. But all this, I doubt not, you are al|ready appri&s;ed of. For my part, I have been a long time &s;en&s;ible there was &s;uch an Opi|nion current among Philo&s;ophers, but was never thorowly convinced of its Truth till now.</P>

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a Right you cannot be de|nied. Figures and Exten&s;ion being di&s;patch|ed, we proceed next to <HI>Motion.</HI> Can a real Motion in any external Body be, at the &s;ame time, both very &s;wift and very &s;low?</P>

<SP>

<P>It cannot.</P>
</SP>

<P>Is not the Motion of a Body &s;wift in a reciprocal Proportion to the time it takes up in de&s;cribing any given Space? Thus a Body that de&s;cribes a Mile in an Hour, moves three times fa&s;ter than it would in ca&s;e it de|&s;cribed only a Mile in three Hours.</P>

<P>Con&s;equently the &s;ame Body may to another &s;eem to perform its Motion over any Space, in half the time that it does to you. And the &s;ame Rea&s;oning will hold as to any other Proportion: That is to &s;ay, according to your Principles (&s;ince the Motions per|ceived are both really in the Object) it is po&s;|&s;ible one and the &s;ame Body &s;hall be really moved, the &s;ame way, at once, both very &s;wift, and very &s;low.

either with common Sen&s;e, or what you ju&s;t now granted?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then as for <HI>Solidity;</HI> either you do not mean any &s;en&s;ible Quality by that Word, and &s;o it is be&s;ide our Inquiry: Or if you do, it mu&s;t be either Hardne&s;s or Re&s;i&s;tance. But both the one and the other are plainly relative to our Sen&s;es: It being evident, that what &s;eems hard to one Animal, may appear &s;oft to another, who hath greater Force and Firm|ne&s;s of Limbs. Nor is it le&s;s plain, that the Re&s;i&s;tance I feel is not in the Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, the very Sen&s;ation of Re&s;i|&s;tance, which is all you immediately perceive, is not in the Body, but the Cau&s;e of that Sen|&s;ation is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, the Cau&s;es of our Sen&s;ations are not Things immediately perceived, and there|fore not &s;en&s;ible. This Point I thought had been already determined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it was; but you will pardon me if I &s;eem a little embarra&s;&s;ed: I know not how to quit my old Notions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>To help you out, do but con&s;ider, that if Exten&s;ion be once acknowleged to have no Exi&s;tence without the Mind, the &s;ame mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be granted of Motion, Soli|dity, and Gravity, &s;ince they all evidently &s;uppo&s;e Exten&s;ion. It is therefore &s;uperfluous to inquire particularly concerning each of
<PB N="38" REF="51">
them. In denying Exten&s;ion, you have de|nied them all to have any real Exi&s;tence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder, <HI>Philonous,</HI> if what you &s;ay be true, why tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers who de|ny the Secondary Qualities any real Exi&s;tence, &s;hould yet attribute it to the Primary. If there is no Difference between them, how can this be accounted for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to account for every Opinion of the Philo&s;ophers. But a|mong other Rea&s;ons which may be a&s;&s;igned for this, it &s;eems probable, that Plea&s;ure and Pain being rather annexed to the former, than the latter, may be one. Heat and Cold, Ta&s;tes, Smells, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have &s;omething more vividly plea&s;ing or di&s;agreeable than the Ideas of Exten&s;ion, Figure, and Motion, affect us with. And, it being too vi&s;ibly ab&s;urd to hold, that Pain or Plea&s;ure can be in an un|perceiving Sub&s;tance, Men are more ea&s;ily weaned from believing the external Exi&s;tence of the Secondary, than the Primary Qualities. You will be &s;atisfied there is &s;omething in this, if you recollect the Difference you made be|tween an inten&s;e and more moderate Degree of Heat, allowing the one a real Exi&s;tence, while you denied it to the other. But after all, there is no rational Ground for that Di|&s;tinction; for &s;urely an indifferent Sen&s;ation is as truly <HI>a Sen&s;ation,</HI> as one more plea&s;ing or painful; and, con&s;equently, &s;hould not
<PB N="39" REF="52">
any more than they be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in an unthinking Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is ju&s;t come into my Head, <HI>Philo|nous,</HI> that I have &s;omewhere heard of a Di|&s;tinction between ab&s;olute and &s;en&s;ible Ex|ten&s;ion. Now, though it be acknowledged that <HI>great</HI> and <HI>&s;mall,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting meerly in the Relation which other extended Beings have to the Parts of our own Bodies, do not re|ally inhere in the Sub&s;tances them&s;elves, yet nothing obliges us to hold the &s;ame with re|gard to <HI>ab&s;olute Exten&s;ion,</HI> which is &s;omething ab&s;tracted from <HI>great</HI> and <HI>&s;mall,</HI> from this or that particular Magnitude or Figure. So likewi&s;e as to Motion, <HI>&s;wift</HI> and <HI>&s;low</HI> are al|together relative to the Succe&s;&s;ion of Ideas in our own Minds. But it does not follow, be|cau&s;e tho&s;e Modifications of Motion exi&s;t not without the Mind, that therefore ab&s;olute Motion ab&s;tracted from them does not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what is it that di&s;tingui&s;hes one Motion, or Part of Exten&s;ion, from another, is it not &s;omething &s;en&s;ible, as &s;ome Degree of Swiftne&s;s or Slowne&s;s, &s;ome certain Mag|nitude or Figure peculiar to each?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e Qualities, therefore, &s;tripped of all &s;en&s;ible Properties, are without all &s;pe|cific and numerical Differences, as the Schools call them.</P>

<P>They are.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it be &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is an univer&s;ally received Maxim, that, <HI>Every thing which exi&s;ts, is par|ticular.</HI> How then can Motion in general, or Exten&s;ion in general, exi&s;t in any corporeal Sub&s;tance?</P>

<P>But I think the Point may be &s;peedi|ly decided. Without doubt you can tell, whether you are able to frame this or that Idea. Now, I am content to put our Di&s;|pute on this I&s;&s;ue. If you can frame in your Thoughts a di&s;tinct ab&s;tract Idea of Motion or Exten&s;ion, dive&s;ted of all tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible Modes, as &s;wift and &s;low, great and &s;mall, round and &s;quare, and the like, which are acknowleged to exi&s;t only in the Mind, I will then yield the Point you contend for.

<P>Can you even &s;eparate the Ideas of Exten&s;ion and Motion, from the Ideas of Light and Colours, hard and &s;oft, hot and cold, with the re&s;t of tho&s;e Qualities which they who make the Di&s;tinction, term <HI>Secon|dary.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Is it not an ea&s;y Matter, to con&s;ider Exten&s;ion and Motion by them&s;elves, ab&s;tracted from all other &s;en&s;ible Qualities? Pray, how do the Mathematicians treat of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege, <HI>Hylas,</HI> it is not diffi|cult to form general Propo&s;itions and Rea&s;on|ings about tho&s;e Qualities, without mention|ing any other; and in this Sen&s;e, to con&s;ider or treat of them ab&s;tractedly. But, how does it follow, that becau&s;e I can pronounce the Word <HI>Motion,</HI> by it&s;elf, I can form the Idea of it in my Mind exclu&s;ive of Body? or, be|cau&s;e Theoremes may be made of Exten|&s;ion and Figures, without any mention of <HI>Great,</HI> or <HI>Small,</HI> or any other &s;en&s;ible Mode or Quality? That, therefore, it is po&s;&s;ible &s;uch an ab&s;tract Idea of Exten&s;ion, without any particular Size, Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hou'd be di|&s;tinctly formed, and apprehended by the Mind? Mathematicians treat of Quantity, without regarding what other &s;en&s;ible Qualities it is attended with, as being altogether indifferent to their Demon&s;trations. But, when laying a&s;ide the Words, they contemplate the bare Ideas, I believe you will find, they are not the pure ab&s;tracted Ideas of Exten&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, what &s;ay you to <HI>pure Intellect?</HI> may not ab&s;tracted Ideas be framed by that Faculty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="55">
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since I cannot frame ab&s;tract Ideas at all, it is plain, I cannot frame them by the Help of <HI>pure Intellect,</HI> what&s;oever Faculty you under&s;tand by tho&s;e Words. Be&s;ides, not to inquire into the Nature of pure Intellect, and its &s;piritual Objects, as <HI>Vertue, Rea&s;on, God,</HI> or the like; thus much &s;eems manife&s;t, that &s;en&s;ible Things are only to be perceived by Sen&s;e, or repre&s;ented by the Imagination. Figures, therefore, and Exten&s;ion, being ori|ginally perceived by Sen&s;e, do not belong to pure Intellect. But, for your farther Satisfaction, try if you can frame the Idea of any Figure, ab&s;tracted from all Particularities of Size, or even from other &s;en&s;ible Qualities.</P>

<P>By no means.</P>

<P>Since, therefore, it is impo&s;&s;ible, even for the Mind, to di&s;unite the Ideas of Exten|&s;ion and Motion from all other &s;en&s;ible Qua|lities, does it not follow, that where the one exi&s;t, there, nece&s;&s;arily, the other exi&s;t likewi&s;e?</P>

any farther Application of Force, again&s;t the Primary too. Be&s;ides, if you will tru&s;t your Sen|&s;es; is it not plain, all &s;en&s;ible Qualities coexi&s;t, or, to them, appear as being in the &s;ame Place?

<P>You need &s;ay no more on this Head. I am free to own, if there be no &s;ecret Error, or Over&s;ight, in our Proceedings hitherto, that all &s;en&s;ible Qualities are alike to be denied Exi&s;tence without the Mind. But my Fear is, that I have been too liberal in my former Conce&s;&s;ions, or overlooked &s;ome Fallacy or other. In &s;hort, I did not take time to think.</P>

<P>For that matter, <HI>Hylas,</HI> you may take what time you plea&s;e, in reviewing the Pro|gre&s;s of our Inquiry. You are at liberty to recover any Slips you might have made, or offer whatever you have omitted, which makes for your fir&s;t Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>One great Over&s;ight I take to be this: That I did not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>Object</HI> from the <HI>Sen&s;ation.</HI> Now, tho this lat|ter may not exi&s;t without the Mind, yet it will not thence follow, that the former can|not.</P>

<P>What Object do you mean? the Ob|ject of the Sen&s;es?</P>

<P>The Sen&s;ation I take to be an Act of the Mind perceiving; be&s;ide which, there is &s;omething perceived; and this I call the <HI>Ob|ject.</HI> For Example, there is Red and Yellow on that Tulip. But then, the Act of percei|ving tho&s;e Colours is in me only, and not in the Tulip.</P>

<SP>

<P>What Tulip do you &s;peak of? is it that which you &s;ee?</P>

<P>Nothing.</P>
</SP>

<P>What you would &s;ay then is, that the Red and Yellow are coexi&s;tent with the Ex|ten&s;ion; is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not all; I wou'd &s;ay, They have a real Exi&s;tence without the Mind, in &s;ome unthinking Sub&s;tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That the Colours are really in the Tulip which I &s;ee, is manife&s;t. Neither can it be denied, that this Tulip may exi&s;t inde|pendent of your Mind, or mine; but that any immediate Object of the Sen&s;es, <HI>i. e.</HI> any Idea, or Combination of Ideas, &s;hould exi&s;t in an unthinking Sub&s;tance, or exterior to all
<PB N="45" REF="58">
Minds, is in it&s;elf an evident Contradiction. Nor can I imagine how this follows, from what you &s;aid ju&s;t now, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Red and Yellow were on the Tulip <HI>you &s;aw,</HI> &s;ince you do not pretend to <HI>&s;ee</HI> that unthinking Sub&s;tance.</P>

<P>I &s;ee you have no mind to be pre&s;|&s;ed that way. To return then to your Di|&s;tinction between <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> and <HI>Object;</HI> if I take you right, you di&s;tingui&s;h in every Per|ception two things, the one an Action of the Mind, the other not.</P>

<P>That is my Meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Either, <HI>Hylas,</HI> you are je&s;ting, or have a very bad Memory. Though, indeed, we went through all the Qualities by Name, one after another; yet my Arguments, or ra|ther your Conce&s;&s;ions, no where tended to prove, that the Secondary Qualities did not &s;ub&s;i&s;t each alone by it&s;elf, but, that they were not <HI>at all</HI> without the Mind. Indeed, in treating of Figure and Motion, we con|cluded, they could not exi&s;t without the Mind, becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible, even in Thought, to &s;eparate them from all Secon|dary Qualities, &s;o as to conceive them exi&s;t|ing by them&s;elves. But then this was not the only Argument made U&s;e of upon that Occa&s;ion. But (to pa&s;s by all that hath been
<PB N="53" REF="66">
hitherto &s;aid, and reckon it for nothing, if you will have it &s;o) I am content to put the whole upon this I&s;&s;ue. If you can conceive it po&s;&s;ible for any Mixture or Combination of Qualities, or any &s;en&s;ible Object whatever, to exi&s;t without the Mind, then I will grant it actually to be &s;o.</P>

<P>That was, I own, an Over&s;ight; but &s;tay, let me con&s;ider what led me into it.&mdash;It is a plea&s;ant Mi&s;take enough. As I was thinking of a Tree in a &s;olitary Place, where no one was pre&s;ent to &s;ee it, methought that was to conceive a Tree as exi&s;ting unperceived or unthought of, not con&s;idering that I my|&s;elf conceived it all the while. But now I plainly &s;ee, that all I can do is to frame Ideas in my own Mind. I may, indeed, conceive in my own Thoughts the Idea of a Tree, or a Hou&s;e, or a Mountain, but that is all.

<P>It does not; but &s;till I know, upon &s;eeing an Object, what Object I &s;hall perceive after having pa&s;&s;ed over a certain Di&s;tance: No matter whether it be exactly the &s;ame or no: There is &s;till &s;omething of Di&s;tance &s;ug|ge&s;ted in the Ca&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good <HI>Hylas,</HI> do but reflect a little on the Point, and then tell me whether there be any more in it than this.

<P>To &s;peak the truth, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I think there are two Kinds of Objects, the one per|ceived immediately, which are likewi&s;e cal|led <HI>Ideas;</HI> the other are real Things, or ex|ternal Objects, perceived by the Mediation of Ideas, which are their Images and Repre|&s;entations.

<P>Yes, <HI>Philonous,</HI> in &s;ome &s;ort there is. For Example, when I look on a Picture, or Statue of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> I may be &s;aid, after a manner, to perceive him (tho' not imme|diately) by my Sen&s;es.</P>

<P>It &s;eems then, you will have our Ideas, which alone are immediately percei|ved, to be Pictures of external Things: And, that the&s;e al&s;o, are perceived by Sen&s;e, ina&s;|much as they have a Conformity or Re&s;em|blance to our Ideas.</P>

<P>Whence comes it then, that your Thoughts are directed to the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, and his are not? This cannot proceed from the Sen&s;ations, or Ideas of Sen&s;e, by you then perceived; &s;ince you acknowlege, you have no Advantage over him in that re&s;pect.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Con&s;equently, it will not follow from that In&s;tance, that any thing is perceived by Sen&s;e, which is not immediately perceived. Tho' I grant, we may, in one Acceptation, be &s;aid to perceive &s;en&s;ible Things mediately by Sen&s;e: That is, when from a frequently per|ceived Connexion, the immediate Perception of Ideas by one Sen&s;e, &s;ugge&s;ts to the Mind others, perhaps belonging to another Sen&s;e, which are wont to be connected with them. For in&s;tance, when I hear a Coach drive along the Streets, immediately I perceive only the Sound; but from the Experience I have had, that &s;uch a Sound is connected with a Coach, I am &s;aid to hear the Coach. It is, neverthe|le&s;s, evident, that, in Truth and Strictne&s;s, nothing can be <HI>heard</HI> but <HI>Sound:</HI> And the Coach is not then properly perceived by Sen&s;e, but &s;ugge&s;ted from Experience. So likewi&s;e, when we are &s;aid to &s;ee a red-hot Bar of Iron; the Solidity and Heat of the Iron are not the Objects of Sight, but &s;ugge&s;ted to the
<PB N="61" REF="74">
Imagination by the Colour and Figure, which are properly perceived by that Sen&s;e. In &s;hort, tho&s;e things alone are actually perceived by any Sen&s;e, which would have been perceived, in ca&s;e that &s;ame Sen&s;e had then been fir&s;t conferred on us. As for other things, it is plain, they are only &s;ugge&s;ted to the Mind by Experience, grounded on former Percep|tions. But, to return to your Compari&s;on of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Picture, it is plain, if you keep to that, you mu&s;t hold, the real Things, or Arche|types of our Ideas, are not perceived by Sen&s;e, but by &s;ome internal Faculty of the Soul, as Rea&s;on, or Memory. I wou'd, therefore, fain know, what Arguments you can draw from Rea&s;on, for the Exi&s;tence of what you call <HI>real Things,</HI> or <HI>material Objects.</HI> Or, whe|ther you remember to have &s;een them former|ly, as they are in them&s;elves; or, if you have heard, or read of any one that did.</P>

But, as you have excluded Sen&s;e, pray, &s;hew me what Rea&s;on you have to believe their Exi|&s;tence; or, what <HI>medium</HI> you can po&s;&s;ibly make u&s;e of, to prove it either to mine, or your own Under&s;tanding.</P>

<P>To deal ingenuou&s;ly, <HI>Philonous,</HI> now I con&s;ider the Point, I do not find I can give you any good Rea&s;on for it.

<P>What! Is it come to this, that you only believe the Exi&s;tence of material Ob|jects, and that your Belief is founded barely on the Po&s;&s;ibility of its being true? Then you will have me bring Rea&s;ons again&s;t it: Tho another would think it rea&s;onable, the Proof &s;hould lie on him, who holds the Affir|mative, And after all, this very Point which you are now re&s;olved to maintain, without any Rea&s;on, is, in effect, what you have, more than once, during this Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;een good Rea&s;on to give up. But to pa&s;s over all this; if I under&s;tand you rightly, you &s;ay, our Ideas do not exi&s;t without the Mind; but that they are Copies, Images, or Repre&s;entations of certain Originals, that do.</P>

<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed the Soul makes her Re|&s;idence in &s;ome Part of the Brain, from which the Nerves take their Ri&s;e, and are thence extended to all Parts of the Body. And that outward Objects, by the different Impre&s;&s;ions they make on the Organs of Sen&s;e, communi|cate
<PB N="69" REF="82">
certain vibrative Motions to the Nerves, and the&s;e being filled with Spirits, propagate them to the Brain or Seat of the Soul, which, according to the various Impre&s;&s;ions or Traces thereby made in the Brain, is variou&s;ly affect|ed with Ideas.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What el&s;e think you I cou'd mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sen&s;ible Things are all immediately perceivable; and tho&s;e Things which are im|mediately perceivable, are Ideas; and the&s;e exi&s;t only in the Mind. Thus much you have, if I mi&s;take not, long &s;ince agreed to.</P>

how do you account for the Origine of that Primary Idea or Brain it&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not explain the Origine of our Ideas by that Brain which is perceivable to Sen&s;e, this being it&s;elf only a Combination of &s;en&s;ible Ideas, but by another which I imagine.</P>

<P>Be&s;ide Spirits, all that we know or conceive, are our own Ideas. When, there|fore, you &s;ay, all Ideas are occa&s;ioned by Impre&s;&s;ions in the Brain, do you conceive this Brain or no? If you do, then you talk of Ideas imprinted in an Idea, cau&s;ing that &s;ame Idea, which is ab&s;urd.

At the Pro|&s;pect of the wide and deep Ocean, or &s;ome huge Mountain who&s;e Top is lo&s;t in the Sky, or of an old gloomy Forre&s;t, are not our Minds filled with a plea&s;ing Horror? Even in Rocks and De&s;erts, is there not an agreeable Wildne&s;s? How &s;incere a Plea&s;ure is it to behold the natural Beauties of the Earth! To pre&s;erve and renew our Reli&s;h for them, is not the Veil of Night alternate|ly drawn over her Face, and does &s;he not change her Dre&s;s with the Sea&s;ons? How aptly are the Elements di&s;po&s;ed? What Va|riety and U&s;e in Stones and Minerals? What Delicacy, what Beauty, what Contrivance,
<PB N="72" REF="85">
in animal and vegetable Bodies? How ex|qui&s;itely are all things &s;uited, as well to their particular Ends, as to con&s;titute appo|&s;ite Parts of the Whole! And while they mutu|ally aid and &s;upport, do they not al&s;o &s;et off and illu&s;trate each other? Rai&s;e now your Thoughts from this Ball of Earth, to all tho&s;e glorious Luminaries that adorn the high Arch of Heaven. The Motion and Situation of the Planets, are they not admirable for U&s;e and Order? Were tho&s;e (mi&s;called <HI>Erratique)</HI> Globes once known to &s;tray, in their repeated Journeys thorow the pathle&s;s Void? Do they not mea&s;ure Areas round the Sun, ever proportioned to the Times? So fixed, &s;o im|mutable are the Laws by which the un&s;een Author of Nature actuates the Univer&s;e. How vivid and radiant is the Lu&s;tre of the fixed Stars! How magnificent and rich that negli|gent Profu&s;ion, with which they appear to be &s;cattered thorow the whole Azure Vault! Yet, if you take the Tele&s;cope, it brings into your Sight a new Ho&s;t of Stars that e&s;cape the naked Eye. Here they &s;eem contiguous and minute, but, to a nearer View, immen&s;e Orbs of Light at various Di&s;tances far &s;unk in the Aby&s;s of Space. Now, you mu&s;t call Imagination to your Aid. The feeble, nar|row Sen&s;e, cannot de&s;cry innumerable Worlds revolving round the central Fires; and, in tho&s;e Worlds, the Energy of an all-perfect
<PB N="73" REF="86">
Mind di&s;play'd in endle&s;s Forms. But, nei|ther Sen&s;e nor Imagination are big enough, to comprehend the boundle&s;s Extent, with all its dazzling Furniture. Tho the labor|ing Mind exert and &s;train each Power to its utmo&s;t Reach, there &s;till &s;tands our ungra&s;ped, a Surplu&s;age immea&s;urable. Yet all the va&s;t Bodies that compo&s;e this mighty Frame, how di&s;tant and remote &s;oever, are by &s;ome &s;e|cret Mechani&s;m, &s;ome divine Art and Force, linked in a mutual Dependence and Inter|cour&s;e with each other, even with this Earth, which almo&s;t &s;lipt from my Thoughts, and was lo&s;t in the Croud of Worlds.

<P>What! Have you all along agreed to the Premi&s;es, and do you now deny the Conclu&s;ion, and leave me to maintain tho&s;e Paradoxes by my&s;elf which you led me into? This, &s;urely, is not fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny that I agreed with you in tho&s;e Notions that led to Sceptici&s;m. You, indeed, &s;aid, the Reality of &s;en&s;ible Things con&s;i&s;ted in an <HI>ab&s;olute Exi&s;tence</HI> out of the Minds of Spirits, or di&s;tinct from their being perceived. And pur&s;uant to this Notion of Reality, you are obliged to deny &s;en&s;ible Things any real Exi&s;tence: That is, accor|ding to your own Definition, you profe&s;s your&s;elf a <HI>Sceptic.</HI> But I neither &s;aid nor thought, the Reality of &s;en&s;ible Things was to be defined after that Manner. To me it is evident, for the Rea&s;ons you allow of, that &s;en&s;ible Things cannot exi&s;t otherwi&s;e than in a Mind or Spirit. Whence I conclude, not that they have no real Exi&s;tence, but that &s;ee|ing they depend not on my Thought, and have an Exi&s;tence di&s;tinct from being percei|ved by me, <HI>there mu&s;t be &s;ome other Mind wherein they exi&s;t.</HI> As &s;ure, therefore, as the &s;en&s;ible World really exi&s;ts, &s;o &s;ure is there an infinite omnipre&s;ent Spirit who contains and &s;upports it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! This is no more than I and all Chri&s;tians hold; nay, and all others too

who believe there is a God, and that he knows and comprehends all Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but here lies the Difference. Men commonly believe that all Things are known or perceived by God, becau&s;e they believed the Being of a God, whereas I, on the other &s;ide, immediately and nece&s;&s;arily conclude the Being of a God, becau&s;e all &s;en&s;ible Things mu&s;t be perceived by Him.</P>

<P>But &s;o long as we all believe the &s;ame thing, what matter is it how we come by that Belief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But neither do we agree in the &s;ame Opinion. For Philo&s;ophers, tho they ac|knowlege all corporeal Beings to be perceived by God, yet they attribute to them an ab&s;o|lute Sub&s;i&s;tence di&s;tinct from their being per|ceived by any Mind whatever, which I do not. Be&s;ides, is there no Difference between &s;ay|ing, <HI>There is a God, therefore he perceives all Things:</HI> and &s;aying, <HI>Sen&s;ible Things do really exi&s;t: and if they really exi&s;t, they are nece&s;|&s;arily perceived by an infinite Mind: therefore there is an infinite Mind, or God.</HI> This fur|ni&s;hes you with a direct and immediate De|mon&s;tration, from a mo&s;t evident Principle, of the <HI>Being of a God.</HI> Divines and Philo&s;o|phers had proved, beyond all Controver&s;y, from the Beauty and U&s;efulne&s;s of the &s;everal Parts of the Creation, that it was the Work|man&s;hip of God. But that, &s;etting a&s;ide all
<PB N="76" REF="89">
Help of A&s;tronomy and natural Philo&s;ophy, all Contemplation of the Contrivance, Order, and Adju&s;tment of Things, an infinite Mind &s;hould be nece&s;&s;arily inferred from the bare Exi&s;tence of the &s;en&s;ible World, is an Advan|tage peculiar to them only who have made this ea&s;y Reflexion: That the &s;en&s;ible World is that which we perceive by our &s;everal Sen&s;es; and that nothing is perceived by the Sen&s;es be&s;ide Ideas; and that no Idea, or Ar|chetype of an Idea, can exi&s;t otherwi&s;e than in a Mind. You may now, without any labori|ous Search into the Sciences, without any Subtilty of Rea&s;on, or tedious Length of Di&s;|cour&s;e, oppo&s;e and baffle the mo&s;t &s;trenuous Advocate for Athei&s;m. Tho&s;e mi&s;erable Re|fuges, whether in an eternal Succe&s;&s;ion of unthinking Cau&s;es and Effects, or in a for|tuitous Concour&s;e of Atoms; tho&s;e wild Imaginations of <HI>Vanini, Hobbes,</HI> and <HI>Spino|&s;a;</HI> in a word, the whole Sy&s;tem of Athei&s;m, is it not intirely overthrown, by this &s;ingle Reflexion on the Repugnancy included in &s;uppo&s;ing the Whole, or any Part, even the mo&s;t rude and &s;hapele&s;s of the vi&s;ible World, to exi&s;t without a Mind? Let any one of tho&s;e Abettors of Impiety but look into his own Thoughts, and there try if he can con|ceive how &s;o much as a Rock, a De&s;ert, a Chaos, or confu&s;ed Jumble of Atoms; how any thing at all, either &s;en&s;ible or imagina|ble,
<PB N="77" REF="90">
can exi&s;t independent of a Mind, and he need go no farther to be convinced of his Folly. Can any thing be fairer than to put a Di&s;pute on &s;uch an I&s;&s;ue, and leave it to a Man him&s;elf to &s;ee if he can conceive, even in Thought, what he holds to be true in Fact, and from a Notional to allow it a Real Exi&s;tence?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They conceive that the Soul, being im|material, is incapable of being united with material Things, &s;o as to perceive them in them&s;elves, but that &s;he perceives them by her Union with the Sub&s;tance of God, which being &s;piritual, is therefore purely intelligible, or capable of being the immediate Object of a Spirit's Thought. Be&s;ides, the Divine E&s;|&s;ence contains in it Perfections corre&s;pondent to each created Being; and which are, for that Rea&s;on, proper to exhibit or repre&s;ent them to the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not under&s;tand how our Ideas, which are Things altogether pa&s;&s;ive and inert, can be the E&s;&s;ence, or any Part (or like any Part) of the E&s;&s;ence or Sub&s;tance of God, who is an impa&s;&s;ive, indivi&s;ible, purely active

Being. Many more Difficulties and Obje|ctions there are, which occur at fir&s;t View a|gain&s;t this Hypothe&s;is; but I &s;hall only add, that it is liable to all the Ab&s;urdities of the common Hypothe&s;es, in making a created World exi&s;t otherwi&s;e than in the Mind of a Spirit. Be&s;ide all which it has this peculiar to it&s;elf; that it makes that material World &s;erve to no Purpo&s;e. And if it pa&s;s for a good Argument again&s;t other Hypothe&s;es in the Sciences, that they &s;uppo&s;e Nature or the Divine Wi&s;dom to make &s;omething in vain, or do that by tedious round-about Methods, which might have been performed in a much more ea&s;y and compendious way, what &s;hall we think of that Hypothe&s;is which &s;uppo&s;es the whole World made in vain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what &s;ay you, are not you too of Opinion that we &s;ee all Things in God? If I mi&s;take not, what you advance comes near it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I intirely agree with what the Holy Scripture &s;aith, <HI>That in God we live, and move, and have our Being.</HI> But that we &s;ee Things in his E&s;&s;ence after the manner above &s;et forth, I am far from believing. Take here in brief my Meaning. It is evident that the Things I perceive are my own Ideas, and that no Idea can exi&s;t, unle&s;s it be in a Mind. Nor is it le&s;s plain that the&s;e Ideas or Things by me perceived, either them&s;elves or their Archetypes exi&s;t independently of my Mind,
<PB N="79" REF="92">
&s;ince I know my&s;elf not to be their Author, it being out of my Power to determine at Plea&s;ure, what particular Ideas I &s;hall be af|fected with upon opening my Eyes or Ears. They mu&s;t therefore exi&s;t in &s;ome other Mind, who&s;e Will it is they &s;hould be exhi|bited to me. The Things, I &s;ay, immedi|ately perceived, are Ideas or Sen&s;ations, call them which you will. But how can any Idea or Sen&s;ation exi&s;t in, or be produced by, any thing but a Mind or Spirit? This, indeed, is inconceivable: and to a&s;&s;ert that which is inconceivable, is to talk Non&s;en&s;e: Is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But on the other hand, it is very con|ceivable that they &s;hould exi&s;t in, and be pro|duced by, a Spirit; &s;ince this is no more than I daily experience in my&s;elf, ina&s;much as I perceive numberle&s;s Ideas; and by an Act of my Will can form a great Variety of them, and rai&s;e them up in my Imagination: Tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the&s;e Creatures of the Fancy are not altogether &s;o di&s;tinct, &s;o &s;trong, vivid, and permanent, as tho&s;e perceived by my Sen&s;es, which latter are called <HI>Real Things.</HI> From all which I conclude, <HI>there is a Mind which affects me every Moment with all the &s;en&s;ible Impre&s;&s;ions I perceive.</HI> And from the Variety, Order, and Manner of the&s;e, I conclude the Author of them to be <HI>wi&s;e, powerful, and good, beyond Comprehen&s;ion.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="93">
Mark it well; I do not &s;ay, I &s;ee Things by perceiving that which repre&s;ents them in the intelligible Sub&s;tance of God. This I do not under&s;tand; but I &s;ay, The Things by me perceived are known by the Under&s;tanding, and produced by the Will, of an infinite Spirit. And is not all this mo&s;t plain and evident? Is there any more in it, than what a little Ob&s;ervation of our own Minds, and that which pa&s;&s;es in them not only enables us to conceive, but al&s;o obliges us to acknow|lege?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I under&s;tand you very clearly; and own the Proof you give of a Deity &s;eems no le&s;s evident, than it is &s;urprizing. But allowing that God is the &s;upreme and Univer&s;al Cau&s;e of all Things, yet may not there &s;till be a Third Nature be&s;ide Spirits and Ideas? May we not admit a &s;ubordinate and limited Cau&s;e of our Ideas? In a word, may there not for all that be <HI>Matter?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often mu&s;t I inculcate the &s;ame thing? You allow the Things immediately perceived by Sen&s;e to exi&s;t no where without the Mind: But there is nothing perceived by Sen&s;e, which is not perceived immediately: therefore there is nothing &s;en&s;ible that exi&s;ts without the Mind. The Matter, therefore, which you &s;till in&s;i&s;t on, is &s;omething intelli|gible, I &s;uppo&s;e; &s;omething that may be di&s;|covered by Rea&s;on, and not by Sen&s;e.</P>

<P>I find my&s;elf affected with various Ideas, whereof, I know, I am not the Cau&s;e; neither are they the Cau&s;e of them&s;elves, or of one another, or capable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by them&s;elves, as being altogether inactive, fleet|ing, dependent Beings.

<P>No; I &s;hou'd think it very ab&s;urd. Common Cu&s;tom is the Standard of Pro|priety in Language. And for any Man to affect &s;peaking improperly, is to pervert the U&s;e of Speech, and can never &s;erve to a

<P>And has it not been made evident, that no &s;uch Sub&s;tance can po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t?

But what el&s;e is this, than to play with Words, and run into that very Fault you ju&s;t now condemned with &s;o much Rea&s;on?

<PB N="83" REF="96">
to the Supreme Agent, there is a Cau&s;e of a limited and inferior Nature, which concurs in the Production of our Ideas, not by any Act of Will, or Spiritual Efficiency, but by that Kind of Action which belongs to Matter, <HI>viz. Motion.</HI></P>

<P>I find, you are at every Turn relap|&s;ing into your old exploded Conceit, of a moveable, and, con&s;equently, an extended Sub&s;tance exi&s;ting without the Mind. What!

<P>Is it not common to all In&s;truments, that they are applied to the doing tho&s;e things only, which cannot be performed by the meer Act of our Wills. Thus, for in&s;tance, I ne|ver u&s;e an In&s;trument to move my Finger, be|cau&s;e it is done by a Volition. But I &s;hou'd u&s;e one, if I were to remove part of a Rock, or tear up a Tree by the Roots.

<PB N="87" REF="100">
Operations, or not needing it, make u&s;e of it? Thus, it &s;eems to me, that you are ob|liged to own the U&s;e of a lifele&s;s, inactive In&s;trument, to be incompatible with the In|finite Perfection of God; that is, by your own Confe&s;&s;ion, to give up the Point.</P>

<P>But methinks you &s;hou'd be ready to own the Truth, when it has been fairly proved to you. We indeed, who are Be|ings of Finite Powers, are forced to make u&s;e of In&s;truments.

Whence it &s;eems a clear Con&s;equence, that the &s;upreme, unli|mited Agent, u&s;eth no Tool or In&s;trument at all. The Will of an Omnipotent Spirit is no &s;ooner exerted than executed, without the Application of Means, which, if they are imployed by inferior Agents, it is not upon account of any real Efficacy that is in them, or nece&s;&s;ary Aptitude to produce any Effect, but meerly in compliance with the Laws of Nature, or tho&s;e Conditions pre&s;cribed to them by the fir&s;t Cau&s;e, who is Him&s;elf a|bove all Limitation or Pre&s;cription what|&s;oever.</P>

<P>Either you perceive the Being of Mat|ter immediately, or mediately. If imme|diately, pray inform me by which of the Sen&s;es you perceive it. If mediately, let me know by what Rea&s;oning it is inferred from tho&s;e Things which you perceive immediate|ly. So much for the Perception. Then for the Matter it&s;elf, I ask whether it is Object, <HI>Sub&s;tratum,</HI> Cau&s;e, In&s;trument, or Occa&s;ion? You have already pleaded for each of the&s;e, &s;hifting your Notions, and making Matter to appear &s;ometime in one Shape, then in ano|ther. And what you have offered, has been di&s;approved and rejected by your&s;elf. If you have any thing new to advance, I wou'd glad|ly hear it.</P>

<P>And yet you are loath to part with your old Prejudice. But to make you quit it more ea&s;ily, I de&s;ire that, be&s;ide what has been hitherto &s;ugge&s;ted, you will farther con&s;ider, whether upon Suppo&s;ition that Mat|ter exi&s;ts, you can po&s;&s;ibly conceive how you &s;hou'd be affected by it? Or &s;uppo&s;ing it did not exi&s;t, whether it be not evident, you might for all that be affected with the &s;ame Ideas you now are, and con&s;equently have the very &s;ame Rea&s;ons to believe its Exi&s;tence that you now can have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege it is po&s;&s;ible we might perceive all things ju&s;t as we do now, tho there was no Matter in the World; neither can I conceive, if there be Matter, how it &s;hou'd produce any Idea in our Minds. And I do farther grant, you have intirely &s;atisfied me, that it is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hou'd be &s;uch a thing as Matter in any of the foregoing Ac|ceptations.

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not expect you &s;hou'd define ex|actly the Nature of that unknown Being. On|ly be plea&s;ed to tell me, whether it is a Sub|&s;tance: And if &s;o, whether you can &s;uppo&s;e

<P>We have already argued on tho&s;e Points. I have no more to &s;ay to them.

<P>Oh <HI>Philonous!</HI> now you think you have entangled me, for if I &s;ay it exi&s;ts in Place, then you will inferr that it exi&s;ts in the Mind, &s;ince it is agreed, that Place or Ex|ten&s;ion exi&s;ts only in the Mind: But I am not a&s;hamed to own my Ignorance.

<P>Since you will not tell me where it exi&s;ts, be plea&s;ed to inform me after what Manner you &s;uppo&s;e it to exi&s;t, or what you mean by its <HI>Exi&s;tence.</HI></P>

<P>Hold, let me think a little&mdash;I pro|fe&s;s, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I do not find that I can. At fir&s;t Glance methought I had &s;ome dilute and airy Notion of pure Entity in Ab&s;tract; but upon clo&s;er Attention it has quite vani&s;hed out of Sight. The more I think on it, the more am I confirmed in my prudent Re&s;olu|tion of giving none but negative An&s;wers, and not pretending to the lea&s;t Degree of any

<P>Pray tell me if the Ca&s;e &s;tands not thus: At fir&s;t, from a Belief of Material Sub|&s;tance, you would have it that the immediate Objects exi&s;ted without the Mind; then that their Archetypes; then Cau&s;es; next In&s;tru|ments; then Occa&s;ions: La&s;tly, <HI>&s;omething in general,</HI> which being interpreted, proves <HI>no|thing.</HI> So Matter comes to nothing. What think you, <HI>Hylas,</HI> is not this a fair Summary of your whole Proceeding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be that as it will, yet I &s;till in&s;i&s;t up|on it, that our not being able to conceive a Thing, is no Argument again&s;t its Ex|i&s;tence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That from a Cau&s;e, Effect, Opera|tion, Sign, or other Circum&s;tance, there may rea&s;onably be inferred the Exi&s;tence of a Thing not immediately perceived, and that it were ab&s;urd for any Man to argue again&s;t the Exi&s;tence of that Thing, from his having no direct and po&s;itive Notion of it, I freely own. But where there is nothing of all this; where neither Rea&s;on nor Revelation induceth us to believe the Exi&s;tence of a Thing; where
<PB N="95" REF="108">
we have not even a relative Notion of it; where an Ab&s;traction is made from perceiving, and being perceived, from Spirit and Idea: In fine, where there is not &s;o much as the mo&s;t inadequate or faint Idea pretended to. I will not, indeed, thence conclude again&s;t the Reality of any Notion, or Exi&s;tence of any thing: But my Inference &s;hall be, that you mean nothing at all: That you employ Words to no manner of Purpo&s;e, without any De&s;ign or Signification what&s;oever. And I leave it to you to con&s;ider how meer Jargon &s;hou'd be treated.</P>

<P>To deal frankly with you, <HI>Philonous,</HI> your Arguments &s;eem in them&s;elves unan|&s;werable, but they have not &s;o great an Ef|fect on me, as to produce that intire Con|viction, that hearty Acquie&s;cence which at|tends Demon&s;tration.

<P>But are you not &s;en&s;ible, <HI>Hylas,</HI> that two Things mu&s;t concur to take away all Scruple, and work a plenary A&s;&s;ent in the Mind? Let a vi&s;ible Object be &s;et in never &s;o clear a Light, yet if there is any Imper|fection in the Sight, or if the Eye is not di|rected towards it, it will not be di&s;tinctly &s;een. And tho a Demon&s;tration be never &s;o well grounded and fairly propo&s;ed, yet if there is withal a Stain of Prejudice, or a
<PB N="96" REF="109">
wrong Bia&s;s on the Under&s;tanding, can it be expected on a &s;uddain to perceive clearly, and adhere firmly to the Truth? No, there is need of Time and Pains: The Attention mu&s;t be awakened and detained by a frequent Repeti|tion of the &s;ame Thing placed oft in the &s;ame, oft in different Lights. I have &s;aid it already, and find I mu&s;t &s;till repeat and in|culcate, that it is an unaccountable Licence you take, in pretending to maintain you know not what, for you know not what Rea|&s;on, to you know not what Purpo&s;e? Can this be paralleled in any Art or Science, any Sect or Profe&s;&s;ion of Men? Or is there any thing &s;o barefacedly groundle&s;s and unrea|&s;onable to be met with, even in the lowe&s;t of common Conver&s;ation? But perhaps you will &s;till &s;ay Matter may exi&s;t, tho' at the &s;ame time you neither know what is meant by <HI>Matter,</HI> or by its <HI>Exi&s;tence.</HI> This indeed is &s;urprizing, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e it is altogether voluntary and of your own Head, you not being led to it by any one Rea&s;on, for I challenge you to &s;hew me that Thing in Nature, which needs Matter to explain or account for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reality of Things cannot be maintained without &s;uppo&s;ing the Exi&s;tence of Matter. And is not this, think you, a good Rea&s;on why I &s;hou'd be earne&s;t in its Defence?</P>

Or, if this will not do, how is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hou'd be a&s;&s;ured of the Reali|ty of this Thing, which I actually &s;ee in this Place, by &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;ome unknown Thing, which I never did or can &s;ee, exi&s;ts after an unknown manner, in an unknown place, or in no place at all? How can the &s;uppo&s;ed Reality of that which is intangible, be a Proof that any thing tangible really exi&s;ts? or, of that which is invi&s;ible, that any vi&s;ible thing, or, in general, of any thing which is imperceptible, that a Perceptible exi&s;ts?

Nor is this all: You are not only ignorant of the true Nature of every Thing, but you know not whether any thing really exi&s;ts, or whe|ther there are any true Natures at all; fora&s;|much as you attribute to your material Be|ings an ab&s;olute or external Exi&s;tence, where|in you &s;uppo&s;e their Reality con&s;i&s;ts. And as you are forced in the end to acknowlege, &s;uch an Exi&s;tence means either a direct Re|pugnancy, or nothing at all, it follows, that you are obliged to pull down your own Hypothe&s;is of material Sub&s;tance, and po&s;i|tively to deny the real Exi&s;tence of any Part of the Univer&s;e.

<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>Hylas,</HI> I do not pre|tend to frame any Hypothe&s;is at all. I am of a vulgar Ca&s;t, &s;imple enough to believe my Sen&s;es, and leave Things as I find them. To be plain, it is my Opinion, that the real Things are tho&s;e very Things I &s;ee and feel, and perceive by my Sen&s;es. The&s;e I know, and finding they an&s;wer all the Nece&s;&s;ities and Purpo&s;es of Life, have no rea&s;on to be &s;olici|tous about any other unknown Beings. A Piece of &s;en&s;ible Bread, for In&s;tance, wou'd &s;tay my Stomach better than ten thou&s;and times as much of that in&s;en&s;ible, unintelligi|ble, real Bread you &s;peak of. It is likewi&s;e my Opinion, that Colours and other &s;en&s;ible Qualities are on the Objects. I cannot for

my Life help thinking that Snow is white, and Fire hot. You, indeed, who by <HI>Snow</HI> and <HI>Fire</HI> mean certain external, unperceived, unperceiving Sub&s;tances, are in the right to deny Whitene&s;s or Heat to be Affections in|herent in them. But I, who under&s;tand by tho&s;e Words the Things I &s;ee and feel, am obliged to think like other Folks. And, as I am no Sceptic with regard to the Nature of Things, &s;o neither am I as to their Exi&s;tence. That a thing &s;hou'd be really perceived by my Sen&s;es, and at the &s;ame time not really exi&s;t, is to me a plain Contradiction; &s;ince I cannot pre&s;cind or ab&s;tract, even in Thought, the Exi&s;tence of a &s;en&s;ible Thing from its be|ing perceived. Wood, Stones, Fire, Water, Fle&s;h, Iron, and the like Things, which I name and di&s;cour&s;e of, are Things that I know; otherwi&s;e I &s;hou'd never have thought of them, or named them. And I &s;hou'd not have known them, but that I perceived them by my Sen&s;es; and Things perceived by the Sen&s;es are immediately perceived; and Things immmediately perceived are Ideas; and Ideas cannot exi&s;t without the Mind; their Exi&s;tence, therefore, con&s;i&s;ts in being per|ceived; when, therefore, they are actually perceived, there can be no Doubt of their Exi&s;tence. Away then with all that Scepti|ci&s;m, all tho&s;e ridiculous Philo&s;ophical Doubts. What a Je&s;t is it for a Philo&s;opher to que&s;tion

<P>I can; but then it mu&s;t be in ano|ther mind. When I deny &s;en&s;ible Things an Exi&s;tence out of the Mind, I do not mean my Mind in particular, but all Minds.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to your fir&s;t Que&s;tion; I own I have properly no Idea, either of God or any other Spirit; for, the&s;e being active, cannot be repre&s;ented by things perfectly inert, as our Ideas are. I do, neverthele&s;s, know, that I, who am a Spirit or thinking Sub&s;tance, exi&s;t as certainly, as I know my Ideas exi&s;t. Farther, I know what I mean by the Terms <HI>I</HI> and <HI>My&s;elf;</HI> and I know this immediately, or intuitively, tho I do not perceive it as I per|ceive a Triangle, a Colour, or a Sound. The Mind, Spirit, or Soul, is that indivi&s;ible un|extended
<PB N="111" REF="124">
Thing, which thinks, acts, and per|ceives. I &s;ay, <HI>indivi&s;ible,</HI> becau&s;e unextend|ed; and <HI>unextended,</HI> becau&s;e extended, figu|red, moveable Things, are Ideas; and that which perceives Ideas, which thinks, and wills, is plainly it&s;elf no Idea, nor like an Idea. Ideas are Things inactive, and per|ceived. And Spirits a &s;ort of Beings, alto|gether different from them. I do not, there|fore, &s;ay, my Soul is an Idea, or like an Idea. However, taking the Word <HI>Idea</HI> in a large Sen&s;e, my Soul may be &s;aid to furni&s;h me with an Idea, that is, an Image, or Likene&s;s of God, tho, indeed, extremely inadequate. For all the Notion I have of God, is obtained by reflecting on my own Soul, heightning its Powers, and removing its Imperfections. I have, therefore, tho not an inactive Idea, yet, in my&s;elf, &s;ome &s;ort of an active, thinking Image of the Deity. And tho I perceive Him not by Sen&s;e, yet I have a Notion of Him, or know Him by Reflexion and Rea|&s;oning. My own Mind, and my own Ideas, I have an immediate Knowlege of; and by the Help of the&s;e, do mediately apprehend the Po&s;&s;ibility of the Exi&s;tence of other Spi|rits and Ideas. Farther, from my own Be|ing, and from the Dependency I find in my|&s;elf, and my Ideas, I do, by an Act of Rea|&s;on, nece&s;&s;arily infer the Exi&s;tence of a God, and of all created Things in the Mind of
<PB N="112" REF="125">
God. So much for your fir&s;t Que&s;tion. For the &s;econd: I &s;uppo&s;e, by this time you can an&s;wer it your&s;elf.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I grant the Exi&s;tence of a &s;en&s;ible Thing con&s;i&s;ts in being perceiva|ble, but not in being actually perceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is perceivable but an Idea? And can an Idea exi&s;t without being actually perceived? The&s;e are Points long &s;ince agreed between us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, be your Opinion never &s;o true: Yet, &s;urely, you will not deny it is &s;hocking, and contrary to the common Sen&s;e of Men. Ask the Fellow, whether yonder Tree has an Exi&s;tence out of his Mind: What An|&s;wer think you he wou'd make?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ame that I &s;hou'd my&s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> That it does exi&s;t out of his Mind. But then to a Chri&s;tian, it cannot &s;urely be &s;hock|ing to &s;ay, The real Tree exi&s;ting without his Mind is truly known and comprehended by (that is, <HI>exi&s;ts in)</HI> the infinite Mind of God. Probably he may not at fir&s;t Glance be aware of the direct and immediate Proof there is of this, ina&s;much as the very Being of a Tree, or any other &s;en&s;ible Thing, implies a Mind wherein it is. But the Point it&s;elf he cannot deny. The Que&s;tion between the Materia|li&s;ts and me is, not whether Things have a real Exi&s;tence out of the Mind of this or that Per&s;on, but whether they have an ab&s;o|lute Exi&s;tence, di&s;tinct from being perceived
<PB N="114" REF="127">
by God, and exterior to all Minds. This, indeed, &s;ome Heathens and Philo&s;ophers have affirmed, but whoever entertains Notions of the Deity &s;uitable to the Holy Scriptures, will be of another Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, according to your Notions, what Difference is there between real Things, and Chimeras formed by the Imagination, or the Vi&s;ions of a Dream, &s;ince they are all equally in the Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Ideas formed by the Imagina|tion, are faint and indi&s;tinct; they have, be|&s;ides, an intire Dependence on the Will. But the Ideas perceived by Sen&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> real Things, are more vivid and clear, and being imprint|ed on the Mind by a Spirit di&s;tinct from us, have not a like Dependence on our Will. There is, therefore, no Danger of confound|ing the&s;e with the foregoing: And there is as little of confounding them with the Vi&s;ions of a Dream, which are dim, irregular, and confu&s;ed. And tho they &s;hou'd happen to be never &s;o lively and natural, yet by their not being connected, and of a Piece, with the pre|ceding and &s;ub&s;equent Tran&s;actions of our Lives, they might ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from Realities. In &s;hort, by whatever Me|thod you di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Things</HI> from <HI>Chimeras</HI> on your own Scheme, the &s;ame, it is evident, will hold al&s;o upon mine. For it mu&s;t be, I pre&s;ume, by &s;ome perceived Difference, and

I am not for depriving you of any one thing that you perceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;till, <HI>Philonous,</HI> you hold, there is nothing in the World but Spirits and Ideas. And this, you mu&s;t needs acknowlege, &s;ounds very odly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own the Word <HI>Idea,</HI> not being com|monly u&s;ed for <HI>Thing,</HI> &s;ounds &s;omething out of the way. My Rea&s;on for u&s;ing it was, becau&s;e a nece&s;&s;ary Relation to the Mind is under&s;tood to be implied by that Term; and it is now commonly u&s;ed by Philo&s;ophers, to denote the immediate Objects of the Under|&s;tanding. But however odly the Propo&s;ition may &s;ound in Words, yet it includes nothing &s;o very &s;trange or &s;hocking in its Sen&s;e, which in effect amounts to no more than this, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are only Things perceiving, and Things perceived; or that every un|thinking Being is nece&s;&s;arily, and from the very Nature of its Exi&s;tence, perceived by &s;ome Mind; if not by any finite, created Mind, yet certainly by the infinite Mind of God, in whom <HI>we live, and move, and have our Being.</HI> Is this as &s;trange as to &s;ay, The &s;en&s;ible Qualities are not on the Objects: Or, That we cannot be &s;ure of the Exi&s;tence of Things, or know any thing of their real Natures, tho we both &s;ee and feel them, and perceive them by all our Sen&s;es?</P>

<P>And in Con&s;equence of this, mu&s;t we not think there are no &s;uch Things as Phy&s;i|cal or Corporeal Cau&s;es: But that a Spirit is the immediate Cau&s;e of all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in Nature? Can there be any thing more extra|vagant than this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is infinitely more extravagant to &s;ay, A thing which is inert, operates on the Mind, and which is unperceiving, is the Cau&s;e of our Perceptions, without any regard ei|ther to Con&s;i&s;tency, or the old known Axiom: <HI>Nothing can give to another that which it hath not it&s;elf.</HI> Be&s;ides, that which to you, I know not for what Rea&s;on, &s;eems &s;o extra|vagant, is no more than the Holy Scriptures a&s;&s;ert in a hundred Places. In them God is repre&s;ented as the &s;ole and immediate Author of all tho&s;e Effects, which &s;ome Heathens and Philo&s;ophers are wont to a&s;cribe to Nature, Matter, Fate, or the like unthinking Princi|ple. This is &s;o much the con&s;tant Language of Scripture, that it were needle&s;s to confirm it by Citations.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not aware, <HI>Philonous,</HI> that in making God the immediate Author of all the Motions in Nature, you make him the Au|thor of Murder, Sacrilege, Adultery, and the like heinous Sins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In An&s;wer to that, I ob&s;erve fir&s;t, that the Imputation of Guilt is the &s;ame, whether a Per&s;on commits an Action with or without
<PB N="117" REF="130">
an In&s;trument. In ca&s;e, therefore, you &s;up|po&s;e God to act by the Mediation of an In&s;tru|ment, or Occa&s;ion, called <HI>Matter,</HI> you as truly make Him the Author of Sin as I, who think Him the immediate Agent in all tho&s;e Operations vulgarly a&s;cribed to Nature. I farther ob&s;erve, that Sin or moral Turpitude does not con&s;i&s;t in the outward Phy&s;ical Action or Motion, but in the internal Devia|tion of the Will from the Laws of Rea&s;on and Religion. This is plain, in that the kil|ling an Enemy in a Battel, or putting a Cri|minal legally to Death, is not thought &s;inful, tho the outward Act be the very &s;ame with that in the Ca&s;e of Murder. Since, therefore, Sin does not con&s;i&s;t in the Phy&s;ical Action, the making God an immediate Cau&s;e of all &s;uch Actions, is not making Him the Author of Sin. La&s;tly, I have no where &s;aid, that God is the only Agent who produces all the Mo|tions in Bodies. It is true, I have denied there are any other Agents be&s;ide Spirits: But this is very con&s;i&s;tent with allowing to Thinking, Rational Beings, in the Production of Motions, the U&s;e of limited Powers, ulti|mately, indeed, derived from God, but im|mediately under the Direction of their own Wills, which is &s;ufficient to intitle them to all the Guilt of their Actions.</P>

<P>But the denying Matter, <HI>Philonous,</HI> or corporeal Sub&s;tance; there is the Point.
<PB N="118" REF="131">
You can never per&s;uade me that this is not repugnant to the univer&s;al Sen&s;e of Man|kind. Were our Di&s;pute to be determined by mo&s;t Voices, I am confident you wou'd give up the Point, without gathering the Votes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h both our Opinions were fairly &s;tated, and &s;ubmitted to the Judgment of Men, who had plain common Sen&s;e, without the Prejudices of a learned Education. Let me be repre&s;ented as one who tru&s;ts his Sen&s;es, who thinks he knows the Things he &s;ees and feels, and entertains no Doubts of their Exi&s;tence; and you fairly &s;et forth with all your Doubts, your Paradoxes, and your Sceptici&s;m about you, and I &s;hall willingly acquie&s;ce in the Determination of any indiffe|rent Per&s;on. That there is no Sub&s;tance wherein Ideas can exi&s;t be&s;ide Spirit, is to me evident. And that the Objects immediately perceived, are Ideas, is on all Hands agreed. And that &s;en&s;ible Qualities are Objects imme|diately perceived, no one can deny. It is therefore evident, there can be no <HI>Sub&s;tratum</HI> of tho&s;e Qualities, but Spirit, in which they exi&s;t, not by way of Mode or Property, but as a thing perceived in that which perceives it. I deny therefore that there is any un|thinking <HI>Sub&s;tratum</HI> of the Objects of Sen&s;e, and, in that Acceptation, that there is any material Sub&s;tance. But, if by <HI>material Sub|&s;tance</HI> is meant only &s;en&s;ible Body, that which
<PB N="119" REF="132">
is &s;een and felt, (and the unphilo&s;ophical Part of the World I dare &s;ay mean no more) then I am more certain of Matter's Exi&s;tence than you, or any other Philo&s;opher, pretend to be. If there be any thing which makes the Generality of Mankind aver&s;e from the Notions I e&s;pou&s;e: It is a Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion that I deny the Reality of &s;en&s;ible Things: But, as it is you who are guilty of that, and not I, it follows, that in truth their Aver&s;ion is again&s;t your Notions, and not mine. I do therefore a&s;&s;ert, that I am as certain as of my own Being, that there are Bodies or corpo|real Sub&s;tances, (meaning the Things I per|ceive by my Sen&s;es) and that, granting this, the Bulk of Mankind will take no Thought about, nor think them&s;elves at all concerned in the Fate of, tho&s;e unknown Natures, and Philo&s;ophical Quiddities, which &s;ome Men are &s;o fond of.</P>

<P>What &s;ay you to this: Since, accor|ding to you, Men mu&s;t judge of the Reality of Things by their Sen&s;es, how can a Man be mi&s;taken, in thinking the Moon a plain lucid Surface, about a Foot in Diameter; or a &s;quare Tower, &s;een at a di&s;tance, round; or an Oar, with one End in the Water, crooked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is not mi&s;taken, with regard to the Ideas he actually perceives; but in the Infe|rences he makes from his pre&s;ent Percep|tions.
<PB N="120" REF="133">
Thus, in the Ca&s;e of the Oar, what he immediately perceives by Sight, is cer|tainly crooked; and &s;o far he is in the right. But if he thence conclude, that upon taking the Oar out of the Water, he &s;hall perceive the &s;ame Crookedne&s;s; or, that it wou'd af|fect his Touch, as crooked things are wont to do: In that he is mi&s;taken. In like man|ner, if he &s;hall conclude from what he per|ceives in one Station, that, in ca&s;e he advan|ced toward the Moon, or Tower, he &s;hou'd &s;till be affected with the like Ideas, he is mi|&s;taken. But his Mi&s;take lies not in what he perceives immediately, and at pre&s;ent, (it be|ing a manife&s;t Contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e, he &s;hou'd err in re&s;pect of that) but, in the wrong Judgment he makes, concerning the Ideas he apprehends to be connected with tho&s;e im|mediately perceived: Or, concerning the Ideas that, from what he perceives at pre&s;ent, he imagines wou'd be perceived in other Cir|cum&s;tances. The Ca&s;e is the &s;ame, with re|gard to the <HI>Copernican</HI> Sy&s;tem.

<P>Now, let me ask you Two Que|&s;tions: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Whether it be agreeable to the U&s;age either of Philo&s;ophers or others, to give the Name <HI>Matter</HI> to an unextended, active Being? And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether it be not ridiculou&s;ly ab&s;urd, to mi&s;apply Names contrary to the common U&s;e of Language?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, let it not be called Matter, &s;ince you will have it &s;o, but &s;ome <HI>Third Nature</HI> di&s;tinct from Matter and Spirit. For, what rea&s;on is there, why you &s;hou'd call it Spirit; does not the Notion of Spirit imply, that it is thinking, as well as active and un|extended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Rea&s;on is this: Becau&s;e I have a mind to have &s;ome Notion or Meaning in what I &s;ay, but I have no Notion of any Action di&s;tinct from Volition, neither can I conceive Volition to be any where but in a Spirit: therefore, when I &s;peak of an active Being, I am obliged to mean a Spirit. Be&s;ide, what can be plainer, than that a thing which hath no Ideas in it&s;elf, cannot impart them to me; and if it hath Ideas, &s;urely it mu&s;t be a Spirit. To make you comprehend the Point &s;till more clearly, if it be po&s;&s;ible: I a&s;&s;ert as well as you, that, &s;ince we are affected from without, we mu&s;t allow Powers to be with|out, in a Being di&s;tinct from our&s;elves. So far we are agreed. But then, we differ as to the Kind of this powerful Being. I will have
<PB N="123" REF="136">
it to be Spirit, you Matter, or I know not what (I may add too, you know not what) Third Nature. Thus, I prove it to be Spi|rit. From the Effects I &s;ee produced, I con|clude, there are Actions; and becau&s;e Acti|ons, Volitions; and becau&s;e there are Voli|tions, there mu&s;t be a Will. Again, the Things I perceive, mu&s;t have an Exi&s;tence, they or their Archetypes, out of my Mind: But be|ing Ideas, neither they, nor their Archetypes, can exi&s;t, otherwi&s;e than in an Under&s;tand|ing: There is, therefore, an Under&s;tanding. But Will and Under&s;tanding con&s;titute, in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, a Mind or Spirit. The power|ful Cau&s;e, therefore, of my Ideas, is in &s;trict Propriety of Speech a <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>

<P>And now, I warrant, you think you have made the Point very clear, little &s;u|&s;pecting, that what you advance leads direct|ly to a Contradiction. Is it not an Ab&s;urdi|ty, to imagine any Imperfection in God?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="124" REF="137">
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have a&s;&s;erted, that whatever Ideas we perceive from without, are in the Mind which affects us. The Ideas, there|fore, of Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s are in God; or, in other Words, God &s;uffers Pain: That is to &s;ay, there is an Imperfection in the Di|vine Nature, which, you acknowleged, was ab&s;urd. So you are caught in a plain Con|tradiction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That God knows or under&s;tands all things, and that He knows, among other things, what Pain is, even every &s;ort of painful Sen&s;ation, and what it is for His Creatures to &s;uffer Pain, I make no que|&s;tion. But that God, tho' He knows, and &s;ometimes cau&s;es painful Sen&s;ations in us, can Him&s;elf &s;uffer Pain, I po&s;itively deny. We, who are limited and dependent Spirits, are liable to Impre&s;&s;ions of Sen&s;e, the Effects of an external Agent, which, being produced again&s;t our Wills, are &s;ometimes painful and unea&s;y. But God, whom no external Being can affect, who perceives nothing by Sen&s;e as we do, who&s;e Will is ab&s;olute, and inde|pendent, cau&s;ing all things, and liable to be thwarted, or re&s;i&s;ted by nothing; it is evi|dent, &s;uch a Being as this, can &s;uffer nothing, nor be affected with any painful Sen&s;ation, or, indeed, any Sen&s;ation at all. We are chained to a Body, that is to &s;ay, our Per|ceptions are connected with corporeal Mo|tions.
<PB N="125" REF="138">
By the Law of our Nature, we are affected upon every Alteration in the nervous Parts of our &s;en&s;ible Body: Which &s;en&s;ible Body, rightly con&s;idered, is nothing but a Complexion of &s;uch Qualities, or Ideas, as have no Exi&s;tence di&s;tinct from being percei|ved by a Mind: So that this Connexion of Sen&s;ations with corporeal Motions, means no more, than a Corre&s;pondence in the Or|der of Nature, between two Setts of Ideas, or Things immediately perceivable. But God is a pure Spirit, di&s;engaged from all &s;uch Sympathy, or natural Ties. No corpo|real Motions are attended with the Sen&s;ati|ons of Pain, or Plea&s;ure, in his Mind. To know every thing knowable, is certainly a Perfection; but to endure, or &s;uffer, or feel any thing by Sen&s;e, is an Imperfection. The former, I &s;ay, agrees to God, but not the lat|ter. God knows, or hath Ideas; but His Ideas are not convey'd to Him by Sen&s;e, as ours are.

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="126" REF="139">
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me &s;ee how you demon&s;trate that Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I lay it down for a Principle, that the Moments, or Quantities of Motion in Bo|dies, are in a direct, compounded Rea&s;on, of the Velocities and Quantities of Matter con|tained in them. Hence, where the Velocities are equal, it follows, the Moments are di|rectly, as the Quantity of Matter in each. But it is found by Experience, that all Bo|dies (bating the &s;mall Inequalities, ari&s;ing from the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Air) de&s;cend with an equal Velocity; the Motion, therefore, of de&s;cending Bodies, and, con&s;equently, their Gravity, which is the Cau&s;e or Principle of that Motion, is proportional to the Quan|tity of Matter, which was to be demon&s;tra|ted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lay it down as a &s;elf-evident Principle, that the Quantity of Motion in any Body, is proportional to the Velocity and <HI>Matter,</HI> taken together: And this is made u&s;e of to prove a Propo&s;ition, from whence the Exi&s;tence of <HI>Matter</HI> is inferred. Pray, is not this arguing in a Circle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the Premi&s;e, I only mean, that the Motion is proportional to the Velocity, joint|ly with the Exten&s;ion and Solidity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But allowing this to be true, yet it will not thence follow, that Gravity is pro|portional to <HI>Matter,</HI> in your Philo&s;ophic Sen&s;e
<PB N="127" REF="140">
of the Word; except you take it for granted, that unknown <HI>Sub&s;tratum,</HI> or whatever el&s;e you call it, is proportional to tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible Quali|ties; which to &s;uppo&s;e, is plainly begging the Que&s;tion. That there is Magnitude and Soli|dity, or Re&s;i&s;tance, perceived by Sen&s;e, I readi|ly grant; as likewi&s;e that Gravity may be pro|portional to tho&s;e Qualities, I will not di&s;pute. But that either the&s;e Qualities, as perceived by us, or the Powers producing them, do exi&s;t in a <HI>material Sub&s;tratum;</HI> this is what I deny, and you, indeed, affirm, but, not|with&s;tanding your Demon&s;tration, have not yet proved.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no longer on that Point. Do you think, however, you &s;hall per&s;uade me the natural Philo&s;ophers have been dream|ing all this while; pray, what becomes of all their Hypothe&s;es and Explications of the <HI>Phae|nomena,</HI> which &s;uppo&s;e the Exi&s;tence of Mat|ter?</P>

<P>I have told you &s;o a hundred times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore, to explain the <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> is to &s;hew how we come to be affected with Ideas, in that Manner and Series, wherein
<PB N="128" REF="141">
they are imprinted on our Sen&s;es. Is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now if you can prove, that any Phi|lo&s;opher has explained the Production of any one Idea in our Minds, by the Help of <HI>Mat|ter,</HI> I &s;hall for ever acquie&s;ce and look on all that has been &s;aid again&s;t it as nothing: But if you cannot, it is in vain to urge the Expli|cation of <HI>Phaenomena.</HI> That a Being endow|ed with Knowlege and Will, &s;hou'd produce or exhibit Ideas, is ea&s;ily under&s;tood. But that a Being which is utterly de&s;titute of the&s;e Faculties &s;hou'd be able to produce Ideas, or in any Sort to affect an Intelligence, this I can never under&s;tand. This, I &s;ay, tho we had &s;ome po&s;itive Conception of Matter, tho we knew its Qualities, and cou'd compre|hend its Exi&s;tence, wou'd yet be &s;o far from explaining Things, that it is it&s;elf the mo&s;t inexplicable thing in the World. And, for all this, it will not follow, that Philo&s;ophers have been doing nothing neither; for, by ob&s;erving and rea&s;oning upon the Connexion of Ideas, they di&s;cover the Laws and Methods of Na|ture, which is a part of Knowlege both u&s;eful and entertaining.</P>

<P>That every epidemical Opinion ari&s;ing from Prejudice, or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Thoughtle&s;ne&s;s, may be imputed to God, as the Author of it, I believe, you will not affirm. What&s;oever Opi|nion we father on Him, it mu&s;t be, either be|cau&s;e He has di&s;covered it to us by &s;uperna|tural Revelation, or, becau&s;e it is &s;o evident to our natural Faculties, which were framed and given us by God, that it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hou'd with-hold our A&s;&s;ent from it. But, where is the Revelation? or, where is the Evidence that extorts the Belief of Matter? Nay, How does it appear, that Matter, taken for &s;omething di&s;tinct from what we perceive by our Sen&s;es, is thought to exi&s;t by all Man|kind, or, indeed, by any, except a few Phi|lo&s;ophers, who do not know what they wou'd be at?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the Rejecting a Notion that has no Foundation, either in Sen&s;e, in Rea&s;on, or in Divine Authority, &s;hou'd be thought to un&s;ettle
<PB N="130" REF="143">
the Belief of &s;uch Opinions as are grounded on all or any of the&s;e, I cannot imagine. That Innovations in Government and Religion, are dangerous, and ought to be di&s;countenanced, I freely own. But, is there the like Rea&s;on why they &s;hou'd be di&s;couraged in Philo&s;o|phy? The making any thing known which was unknown before, is an Innovation in Knowledge: And, if all &s;uch Innovations had been forbidden, Men wou'd have made a no|table Progre&s;s in the Arts and Sciences. But, it is none of my bu&s;ine&s;s to plead for Novel|ties and Paradoxes. That the Qualities we perceive, are not on the Objects: That we mu&s;t not believe our Sen&s;es: That we know nothing of the real Nature of Things, and can never be a&s;&s;ured even of their Exi&s;tence: That real Colours and Sounds, are nothing but certain unknown Figures and Motions: That Motions are, in them&s;elves, neither &s;wift nor &s;low: That there are in Bodies, ab&s;olute Exten&s;ions, without any particular Magnitude or Figure: That a Thing &s;tupid, thoughtle&s;s, and inactive, operates on a Spi|rit: That the lea&s;t Particle of a Body, con|tains innumerable extended Parts. The&s;e are the Novelties, the&s;e are the &s;trange Notions which &s;hock the genuine, uncorrupted Judg|ment of all Mankind; and, being once ad|mitted, embarra&s;s the Mind with endle&s;s Doubts and Difficulties. And, it is again&s;t
<PB N="131" REF="144">
the&s;e, and the like Innovations, I endeavor to vindicate common Sen&s;e. It is true, in doing this, I may, perhaps, be obliged to u&s;e &s;ome <HI>Ambages,</HI> and Ways of Speech not com|mon. But, if my Notions are once thorow|ly under&s;tood, that which is mo&s;t &s;ingular in them, will, in effect, be found to amount to no more than this: That it is ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible, and a plain Contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e, any unthinking Being &s;hou'd exi&s;t, without being perceived by a Mind.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;ay, you believe your Sen&s;es; and &s;eem to applaud you&s;elf, that in this you agree with the Vulgar.

Why is not the &s;ame Figure, and other &s;en&s;ible Qualities, percei|ved all manner of Ways? and, why &s;hou'd we u&s;e a Micro&s;cope, the better to di&s;cover the true Nature of a Body, if it were di&s;co|verable to the naked Eye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strictly &s;peaking, <HI>Hylas,</HI> we do not &s;ee the &s;ame Object that we feel; neither is the &s;ame Object perceived by the Micro|&s;cope, which was by the naked Eye. But, in ca&s;e every Variation was thought &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a new Kind or Individual, the endle&s;s Number or Confu&s;ion of Names wou'd render Language impracticable. Therefore,
<PB N="133" REF="146">
to avoid this, as well as other Inconvenien|cies, which are obvious upon a little Thought, Men combine together &s;everal Ideas, appre|hended by divers Sen&s;es, or by the &s;ame Sen&s;e at different Times, or in different Cir|cum&s;tances, but ob&s;erved, however, to have &s;ome Connexion in Nature, either with re|&s;pect to Coexi&s;tence or Succe&s;&s;ion; all which they refer to one Name, and con&s;ider as one Thing. Hence it follows, that when I exa|mine by my other Sen&s;es a Thing I have &s;een, it is not, in order to under&s;tand better the &s;ame Object which I had perceived by Sight, the Object of one Sen&s;e not being per|ceived by the other Sen&s;es. And, when I look thro a Micro&s;cope, it is not that I may per|ceive more clearly, what I perceived already with my bare Eyes, the Object perceived by the Gla&s;s being quite different from the for|mer. But in both ca&s;es, my Aim is only to know, what Ideas are connected together; and the more a Man knows of the Connexion of Ideas, the more he is &s;aid to know of the Nature of Things. What, therefore, if our Ideas are variable; what if our Sen&s;es are not in all Circum&s;tances affected with the &s;ame Appearances? It will not thence fol|low, they are not to be tru&s;ted, or, that they are incon&s;i&s;tent either with them&s;elves, or any thing el&s;e, except it be with your preconceived Notion of (I know not what) one &s;ingle, un|changed, unperceivable, real Nature, marked
<PB N="134" REF="147">
by each Name: Which Prejudice &s;eems to have taken its Ri&s;e, from not rightly under|&s;tanding the common Language of Men, &s;peak|ing of &s;everal di&s;tinct Ideas, as united in|to one thing by the Mind. And, indeed, there is Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, &s;everal erroneous Conceits of the Philo&s;ophers are owing to the &s;ame Original: While they began to build their Schemes, not &s;o much on Notions as Words, which were framed by the Vulgar, meerly for Conveniency and Di&s;patch in the common Actions of Life, without any regard to Speculation.</P>

<P>Methinks, I apprehend your Mean|ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is your Opinion, the Ideas we per|ceive by our Sen&s;es, are not real Things, but Images, or Copies of them. Our Knowlege, therefore, is no farther real, than as our Ideas are the true Repre&s;entations of tho&s;e Origi|nals. But, as the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Originals are in them&s;elves unknown, it is impo&s;&s;ible to know how far our Ideas re&s;emble them; or, whether they re&s;emble them at all. We can|not, therefore, be &s;ure we have any real Knowlege. Farther, as our Ideas are perpe|tually varied, without any Change in the &s;up|po&s;ed real Things, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, they cannot all be true Copies of them: Or, if &s;ome are, and others are not, it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the former from the latter.
<PB N="135" REF="148">
And, this plunges us yet deeper in Uncer|tainty. Again, when we con&s;ider the Point, we cannot conceive how any Idea, or any thing like an Idea, &s;hou'd have an ab&s;olute Exi&s;tence out of a Mind: Nor, con&s;equent|ly, according to you, how there &s;hou'd be any real Thing in Nature.

<P>For the pre&s;ent, I have no Inclination to the An&s;wering Part. I wou'd much ra|ther &s;ee how you can get over what follows. Pray, are not the Objects perceived by the

Sen&s;es of one, likewi&s;e perceivable to all o|thers pre&s;ent? If there were an hundred more here, they wou'd all &s;ee the Garden, the Trees, and Flowers, as I &s;ee them.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant, it does. Nor have I ever denied a Difference between the Objects of Sen&s;e and tho&s;e of Imagination. But, what wou'd you infer from thence? You cannot &s;ay, that &s;en&s;ible Objects exi&s;t unperceived, becau&s;e they are perceived by many.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, I can make nothing of that Objection: But, it has led me into another. Is it not your Opinion, that by our Sen&s;es we perceive only the Ideas exi&s;ting in our Minds?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Scripture Account of the Crea|tion, is, what appears to me, utterly irre|concilable with your Notions. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tells us of a Creation: A Creation of what? of Ideas? No, certainly, but of Things, of real Things, &s;olid, corporeal Sub&s;tances. Bring your Principles to agree with this, and I &s;hall the &s;ooner agree with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> mentions the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Earth and Sea, Plants and Animals: That all the&s;e do really exi&s;t, and were, in the Beginning, created by God, I make no que&s;tion. If by <HI>Ideas,</HI> you mean Fictions, and Fancies of the Mind, then the&s;e are no Ideas. If by <HI>Ideas,</HI> you mean immediate Objects of the Under&s;tanding, or &s;en&s;ible Things, which cannot exi&s;t unperceived, or out of a Mind, then the&s;e Things are Ideas. But, whether you do, or do not call them <HI>Ideas,</HI> it matters little. The Difference is on|ly about a Name. And, whether that Name be retained or rejected, the Sen&s;e, the Truth and Reality of Things, continues the &s;ame. In common Talk, the Objects of our Sen&s;es are not termed <HI>Ideas,</HI> but <HI>Things.</HI> Call them &s;o &s;till: Provided you do not attribute to them any ab&s;olute, external Exi&s;tence, and
<PB N="144" REF="157">
I &s;hall never quarrel with you for a Word. The Creation, therefore, I allow to have been a Creation of Things, of <HI>Real</HI> Things. Nei|ther is this, in the lea&s;t, incon&s;i&s;tent with my Principles, as is evident from what I have now &s;aid; and wou'd have been evident to you without this, if you had not forgotten what had been &s;o often &s;aid before. But, as for &s;olid, corporeal Sub&s;tances, I de&s;ire you to &s;hew where <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> makes any mention of them; and, if they &s;hou'd be mentioned by him, or any other in&s;pired Writer, it wou'd &s;till be incumbent on you to &s;hew, tho&s;e Words were not taken in the vulgar Accep|tation, for Things falling under our Sen&s;es, but in the Philo&s;ophic Acceptation, for Mat|ter, or an unknown Quiddity, with an ab&s;o|lute Exi&s;tence. When you have proved the&s;e Points, then (and not till then) may you bring the Authority of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> into our Di|&s;pute.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in vain to di&s;pute about a Point &s;o clear. I am content to refer it to your own Con&s;cience. Are you not &s;atisfied, there is &s;ome peculiar Repugnancy between the <HI>Mo|&s;aic</HI> Account of the Creation, and your No|tions?</P>

<PB N="145" REF="158">
with them. But there is no Sen&s;e you may not as well conceive, believing as I do. Since, be&s;ide Spirits, all you conceive are Ideas; and the Exi&s;tence of the&s;e I do not deny. Neither do you pretend, they exi&s;t without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, let me &s;ee any Sen&s;e you can under&s;tand it in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I imagine, that, if I had been pre&s;ent at the Creation, I &s;hould have &s;een Things produced into Being; that is, become perceptible, in the Order de&s;cribed by the Sa|cred Hi&s;torian. I ever before believed the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Account of the Creation, and now find no Alteration in my Manner of believing it. When Things are &s;aid to begin or end their Exi&s;tence, we do not mean this with regard to God, but His Creatures. All Ob|jects are eternally known by God, or, which is the &s;ame thing, have an eternal Exi&s;tence in his Mind: But, when Things, before un|perceptible to Creatures, are, by a Decree of God, made perceptible to them; then are they &s;aid to begin a relative Exi&s;tence, with re&s;pect to created Minds. Upon reading, therefore, the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Account of the Crea|tion, I under&s;tand, that the &s;everal Parts of the World became gradually perceivable to finite Spirits, endowed with proper Faculties; &s;o that, whoever &s;uch were pre&s;ent, they were, in truth, perceived by them. This is the li|teral,
<PB N="146" REF="159">
obvious Sen&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted to me, by the Words of the Holy Scripture: In which is included, no Mention, or no Thought, either of <HI>Sub&s;tratum,</HI> In&s;trument, Occa&s;ion, or ab&s;o|lute Exi&s;tence. And, upon Inquiry, I doubt not, it will be found, that mo&s;t plain, hone&s;t Men, who believe the Creation, never think of tho&s;e things any more than I. What me|taphy&s;ical Sen&s;e you may under&s;tand it in, you only can tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Philonous,</HI> you do not &s;eem to be aware, that you allow created Things, in the Beginning, only a relative, and, con&s;equent|ly, hypothetical, Being: That is to &s;ay, up|on Suppo&s;ition, there were Men to perceive them, without which they have no Actuality of ab&s;olute Exi&s;tence, wherein Creation might terminate. Is it not, therefore, according to you, plainly impo&s;&s;ible, the Creation of any inanimate Creatures &s;hou'd precede that of Man? And, is not this directly contrary to the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Account?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In An&s;wer to that, I &s;ay, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Crea|ted Beings might begin to exi&s;t, in the Mind of other created Intelligences, be&s;ide Men. You will not, therefore, be able to prove any Contradiction between <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and my No|tions, unle&s;s you fir&s;t &s;hew, there was no other Order of finite created Spirits in Being, before Man. I &s;ay farther, in ca&s;e we conceive the Creation, as we &s;hou'd at
<PB N="147" REF="160">
this time a Parcel of Plants or Vegetables of all &s;orts, produced by an invi&s;ible Power, in a De&s;ert where no body was pre&s;ent: That this Way of explaining or conceiving it, is con&s;i&s;tent with my Principles, &s;ince they deprive you of nothing, either &s;en&s;ible, or imaginable: That it exactly &s;uits with the common, natu|ral, undebauched Notions of Mankind: That it manife&s;ts the Dependence of all Things on God; and, con&s;equently, has all the good Ef|fect or Influence, which it is po&s;&s;ible that im|portant Article of our Faith &s;hou'd have, in making Men humble, thankful, and re&s;igned to their great Creator. I &s;ay, moreover, that in this naked Conception of Things, dive&s;ted of Words, there will not be found any No|tion of what you call the <HI>Actuality of ab&s;o|lute Exi&s;tence.</HI> You may, indeed, rai&s;e a Du&s;t with tho&s;e Terms, and &s;o lengthen our Di|&s;pute to no purpo&s;e.

<P>May we not under&s;tand it to have been intirely in re&s;pect of finite Spirits; &s;o that Things, with regard to us, may proper|ly be &s;aid to begin their Exi&s;tence, or be Created, when God decreed, they &s;hou'd be|come perceptible to intelligent Creatures, in that Order and Manner which He then e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, and we now call the Laws of Na|ture? You may call this a <HI>relative,</HI> or <HI>hypo|thetical Exi&s;tence,</HI> if you plea&s;e. But, &s;o long as it &s;upplies us with the mo&s;t natural, ob|vious, and literal Sen&s;e of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Hi&s;to|ry of the Creation; &s;o long as it an&s;wers all the religious Ends of that great Article; in a Word, &s;o long as you can a&s;&s;ign no other Sen&s;e or Meaning in its &s;tead; why &s;hou'd we reject this?

<PB N="149" REF="162">
Sceptical Humor, of making every thing Non&s;en&s;e and Unintelligible? I am &s;ure, you cannot &s;ay, it is for the Glory of God. For, allowing it to be a thing po&s;&s;i|ble, and conceivable, that the corporeal World &s;hou'd have an ab&s;olute Sub&s;i&s;tence, extrin&s;i|cal to the Mind of God, as well as to the Minds of all created Spirits: Yet, how cou'd this &s;et forth either the Immen&s;ity or Om|ni&s;cience of the Deity, or the nece&s;&s;ary and immediate Dependence of all things on Him? Nay, wou'd it not rather &s;eem to derogate from tho&s;e Attributes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but as to this Decree of God's, for making Things perceptible: What &s;ay you, <HI>Philonous,</HI> is it not plain, God did either execute that Decree from all Eternity, or, at &s;ome certain time, began to will what He had not actually willed before, but only de&s;igned to will. If the former, then there cou'd be no Creation or Beginning of Exi&s;tence in finite Things. If the latter, then we mu&s;t acknow|lege &s;omething new to befall the Deity; which implies a &s;ort of Change: and all Change argues Imperfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, con&s;ider what you are doing. Is it not evident, this Objection concludes equally again&s;t a Creation in any Sen&s;e; nay, again&s;t every other Act of the Deity, di&s;co|verable by the Light of Nature: None of which can we conceive, otherwi&s;e than as per|formed
<PB N="150" REF="163">
in Time, and having a Beginning? God is a Being of tran&s;cendent and unlimited Perfections: His Nature, therefore, is incom|prehen&s;ible to finite Spirits. It is not, there|fore, to be expected, that any Man, whether <HI>Materiali&s;t</HI> or <HI>Immateriali&s;t,</HI> &s;hou'd have ex|actly ju&s;t Notions of the Deity, His Attri|butes, and Ways of Operation? If then you wou'd infer any thing again&s;t me, your Diffi|culty mu&s;t not be drawn from the Inadequate|ne&s;s of our Conceptions of the Divine Na|ture, which is unavoidable on any Scheme; but from the Denial of Matter, of which there is not one Word, directly or indirectly, in what you have now objected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowlege, the Difficulties you are concerned to clear, are &s;uch only as ari&s;e from the Non-exi&s;tence of Matter, and are peculiar to that Notion. So far you are in the right. But I cannot by any means bring my&s;elf to think, there is no &s;uch peculiar Re|pugnancy between the Creation and your Opinion; tho, indeed, where to fix it, I do not di&s;tinctly know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What wou'd you have! do I not ac|knowlege a twofold State of Things? the one Ectypal or Natural, the other Archety|pal and Eternal. The former was created in Time; the latter exi&s;ted from Everla&s;ting, in the Mind of God. Is not this agreeable to the common Notions of Divines? or, is any more
<PB N="151" REF="164">
than this nece&s;&s;ary, in order to conceive the Creation? But you &s;u&s;pect &s;ome peculiar Repugnancy, tho you know not where it lies. To take away all Po&s;&s;ibility of Scruple in the ca&s;e, do but con&s;ider this one Point. Either you are not able to conceive the Creation on any Hypothe&s;is what&s;oever: And if &s;o, there is no ground for Di&s;like or Complaint again&s;t my particular Opinion, on that Score. Or, you are able to conceive it; and if &s;o, why not on my Principles, &s;ince thereby nothing conceivable is taken away? You have all along been allowed the full Scope of Sen&s;e, Imagination, and Rea&s;on. Whatever, there|fore, you cou'd before apprehend, either im|mediately or mediately, by your Sen&s;es, or by Ratiocination from your Sen&s;es; whatever you cou'd perceive, imagine, or under&s;tand, re|mains &s;till with you. If, therefore, the Notion you have of the Creation, by other Principles, be intelligible, you have it &s;till upon mine; if it be not intelligible, I conceive it to be no Notion at all; and &s;o there is no Lo&s;s of it.

<P>When a Man is &s;wayed, he knows not why, to one Side of a Que&s;tion; Can this, think you, be any thing el&s;e, but the Ef|fect of Prejudice, which never fails to attend old and rooted Notions? And, indeed, in this re&s;pect, I cannot deny the Belief of Mat|ter to have very much the Advantage over the contrary Opinion, with Men of a learned Education.</P>

<P>I confe&s;s, it &s;eems to be as you &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a Balance, therefore, to this Weight of Prejudice, let us throw into the Scale the great Advantages that ari&s;e from the Belief of Immateriali&s;m, both in regard to Religion and Humane Learning. The Being of a God, and Incorruptibility of the Soul, tho&s;e great Articles of Religion, are they not pro|ved with the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t immediate Evi|dence? When I &s;ay the Being of a <HI>God,</HI> I do not mean an ob&s;cure, general Cau&s;e of Things, whereof we have no Conception, but <HI>God,</HI> in the &s;trict and proper Sen&s;e of the Word. A Being, who&s;e Spirituality, Omni|pre&s;ence, Providence, Omni&s;cience, Infinite Power and Goodne&s;s, are as con&s;picuous, as the Exi&s;tence of &s;en&s;ible Things, of which (notwith&s;tanding the fallacious Pretences and affected Scruples of <HI>Sceptics)</HI> there is no more rea&s;on to doubt, than of our own Being. Then, with relation to Humane Sciences; in Natural Philo&s;ophy, what Intricacies, what Ob&s;curities, what Contradictions, has the Be|lief of Matter led Men into! To &s;ay nothing of the numberle&s;s Di&s;putes about its Extent, Continuity, Homogeneity, Gravity, Divi&s;ibi|lity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do they not pretend to explain all things by Bodies operating on Bodies, accor|ding to the Laws of Motion? and, yet, are they able to comprehend, how any one Body &s;hou'd move another? Nay, admitting there
<PB N="156" REF="169">
was no Difficulty, in reconciling the Notion of an inert Being with a Cau&s;e; or in con|ceiving, how an Accident might pa&s;s from one Body to another; yet, by all their &s;train|ed Thoughts and extravagant Suppo&s;itions, have they been able to reach the mechanical Production of any one Animal or Vegetable Body? Can they account, by the Laws of Motion, for Sounds, Ta&s;tes, Smells, or Co|lours, or for the regular Cour&s;e of Things? In fine, have they accounted, by Phy&s;ical Prin|ciples, for the Aptitude and Contrivance, even of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Parts of the Uni|ver&s;e? But, laying a&s;ide Matter and corpo|real Cau&s;es, and admitting only the Efficiency of an All-perfect Mind, are not all the Effects of Nature ea&s;y and intelligible? If the <HI>Phae|nomena</HI> are nothing el&s;e but <HI>Ideas;</HI> God is a a <HI>Spirit,</HI> but Matter an unintelligent, unper|ceiving Being. If they demon&s;trate an unli|mited Power in their Cau&s;e; God is Active and Omnipotent, but Matter an inert Ma&s;s. If the Order, Regularity, and U&s;efulne&s;s of them, can never be &s;ufficiently admired; God is infinitely Wi&s;e and Provident, but Matter de&s;titute of all Contrivance and De&s;ign. The&s;e, &s;urely, are great Advantages in <HI>Phy|&s;ics.</HI> Not to mention, that the Apprehen&s;ion of a di&s;tant Deity, naturally di&s;po&s;es Men to a Negligence in their <HI>moral</HI> Actions, which they wou'd be more cautious of, in ca&s;e they
<PB N="157" REF="170">
thought Him immediately pre&s;ent, and acting on their Minds without the Interpo&s;ition of Matter, or unthinking Second Cau&s;es. Then in <HI>Metaphy&s;ics;</HI> what Difficulties concerning Entity in Ab&s;tract, Sub&s;tantial Forms, Hylar|chic Principles, Pla&s;tic Natures, Subjects and Adjuncts, Principles of Individuation, Po&s;&s;ibility of Matter's thinking, Origine of Ideas, the Man|ner how two independent Sub&s;tances, &s;o wide|ly different as <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Matter,</HI> &s;hou'd mu|tually operate on each other? What Diffi|culties, I &s;ay, and endle&s;s Di&s;qui&s;itions con|cerning the&s;e, and innumerable other the like Points, do we e&s;cape, by &s;uppo&s;ing only Spi|rits and Ideas? Even the <HI>Mathematics</HI> them|&s;elves, if we take away the ab&s;olute Exi&s;tence of extended Things, become much more clear and ea&s;y; the mo&s;t &s;hocking Paradoxes and intricate Speculations, in tho&s;e Sciences, de|pending on the infinite Divi&s;ibility of finite Exten&s;ion, which depends on that Suppo&s;i|tion. But, what need is there to in&s;i&s;t on the particular Sciences: Is not that Oppo&s;ition to all Science what&s;oever, that Frenzy of the ancient and modern <HI>Sceptics,</HI> built on the &s;ame Foundation? Or, can you produce &s;o much as one Argument again&s;t the Reality of cor|poreal Things, or in behalf of that avowed utter Ignorance of their Natures, which does not &s;uppo&s;e their Reality to con&s;i&s;t in an ex|ternal, ab&s;olute Exi&s;tence? Upon this Sup|po&s;ition,

<P>Pray, <HI>Hylas,</HI> do you in other Ca&s;es, when a Point is once evidently proved, with|hold your A&s;&s;ent on account of Objections or Difficulties it may be liable to? Are the Difficulties that attend the Doctrine of incom|men&s;urable Quantities, of the Angle of Con|tact, of the A&s;ymptotes to Curves, or the like, &s;ufficient to make you hold out again&s;t Ma|thematical Demon&s;tration? Or, will you di&s;|believe the Providence of God, becau&s;e there may be &s;ome particular things which you know not how to reconcile with it? If there are Difficulties attending Immateriali&s;m, there are, at the &s;ame time, direct and evident Proofs for it. But, for the Exi&s;tence of Mat|ter, there is not one Proof, and far more nu|merous and in&s;urmountable Objections lie

again&s;t it. But, where are tho&s;e mighty Dif|ficulties you in&s;i&s;t on? Alas! you know not where, or what they are; &s;omething which may po&s;&s;ibly occur hereafter. If this be a &s;ufficient Pretence for withholding your full A&s;&s;ent, you &s;hou'd never yield it to any Pro|po&s;ition, how free &s;oever from Exceptions, how clearly and &s;olidly &s;oever demon&s;tra|ted.</P>

<P>But, to arm you again&s;t all future Objections, do but con&s;ider, That which bears equally hard on two contradictory Opinions, can be a Proof again&s;t neither. Whenever, therefore, any Difficulty occurs, try if you can find a Solution for it on the Hypothe&s;is of the <HI>Materiali&s;ts.</HI> Be not deceived by Words; but &s;ound your own Thoughts. And, in ca&s;e you cannot conceive it ea&s;ier by the Help of <HI>Materiali&s;m,</HI> it is plain, it can be no Objection again&s;t <HI>Immateriali&s;m.</HI> Had you proceeded all along by this Rule, you wou'd probably have &s;pared your&s;elf abun|dance of trouble in objecting; &s;ince, of all your Difficulties, I challenge you to &s;hew one that is explained by Matter, nay, which is not more unintelligible with than without that Suppo&s;ition, and, con&s;equently, makes rather <HI>again&s;t</HI> than <HI>for</HI> it. You &s;hou'd con|&s;ider, in each Particular, whether the Diffi|culty ari&s;es from the <HI>Non-exi&s;tence of Matter.</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="174">
If it does not, you might as well argue from the infinite Divi&s;ibility of Exten&s;ion again&s;t the Divine Pre&s;cience, as from &s;uch a Diffi|culty again&s;t <HI>Immateriali&s;m.</HI> And, yet, upon Recollection, I believe, you will find this to have been often, if not always, the Ca&s;e. You &s;hou'd, likewi&s;e, take heed not to ar|gue on a <HI>petitio Principii.</HI> One is apt to &s;ay, The unknown Sub&s;tances ought to be e&s;teemed real Things, rather than the Ideas in our Minds: And, who can tell but the unthinking external Sub&s;tance may concurr, as a Cau&s;e or In&s;trument in the Production of our Ideas? But is not this, proceeding on a Suppo&s;ition that there are &s;uch external Sub&s;tances? And to &s;uppo&s;e this, is it not Begging the Que&s;tion? But, above all things, you &s;hou'd beware of impo&s;ing on your|&s;elf, by that vulgar Sophi&s;m which is cal|led <HI>Ignoratio Elenchi.</HI> You talked often, as if you thought I maintained the Non-exi|&s;tence of &s;en&s;ible Things: Whereas, in truth, no one can be more thorowly a&s;&s;ured of their Exi&s;tence than I am: And it is you who doubt; I &s;hou'd have &s;aid, po&s;itively deny it. Every thing that is &s;een, felt, heard, or any way perceived by the Sen&s;es, is, on the Principles I embrace, a real Being, but not on yours. Remember, the Matter you contend for, is an unknown &s;omewhat, (if,
<PB N="162" REF="175">
indeed, it may be termed <HI>&s;omewhat)</HI> which is quite &s;tripped of all &s;en&s;ible Qualities, and can neither be perceived by Sen&s;e, nor ap|prehended by the Mind. Remember, I &s;ay, that it is not any Object which is hard or &s;oft, hot or cold, blue or white, round or &s;quare, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For all the&s;e things, I affirm, do exi&s;t. Tho, indeed, I deny, they have an Exi&s;tence di&s;tinct from being perceived; or, that they exi&s;t out of all Minds what&s;oever. Think on the&s;e Points; let them be attentively con&s;ider|ed, and &s;till kept in view. Otherwi&s;e, you will not comprehend the State of the Que&s;tion; without which, your Objections will always be wide of the Mark, and, in&s;tead of mine, may po&s;&s;ibly be directed (as more than once they have been) again&s;t your own No|tions.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t needs own, <HI>Philonous,</HI> nothing &s;eems to have kept me from agreeing with you, more than this &s;ame <HI>mi&s;taking the Que|&s;tion.</HI> In denying Matter, at fir&s;t glymp&s;e, I am tempted to imagine, you deny the Things we &s;ee and feel; but, upon Reflexion, find there is no Ground for it. What think you, therefore, of retaining the Name <HI>Matter,</HI> and applying it to &s;en&s;ible Things?

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart: Retain the Word <HI>Matter,</HI> and apply it to the Ob|jects of Sen&s;e, if you plea&s;e, provided you do not attribute to them any Sub&s;i|&s;tence di&s;tinct from their being perceived. I &s;hall never quarrel with you for an Expre&s;|&s;ion. <HI>Matter,</HI> or <HI>material Sub&s;tance,</HI> are Terms introduced by Philo&s;ophers; and, as u&s;ed by them, imply a &s;ort of Independen|cy, or a Sub&s;i&s;tence di&s;tinct from being per|ceived by a Mind: But, are never u&s;ed by common People; or, if ever, it is to &s;ignify the immediate Objects of Sen&s;e. One wou'd think, therefore, &s;o long as the Names of all particular Things, with the Terms, <HI>&s;en&s;ible Sub&s;tance, Body, Stuff,</HI> and the like, are re|tained, the Word <HI>Matter</HI> &s;hou'd be never mi&s;&s;ed in common Talk. And, in Philo|&s;ophical Di&s;cour&s;es, it &s;eems the be&s;t way to leave it quite out; &s;ince there is not, per|haps, any one thing that hath more favo|red and &s;trengthened the depraved Bent of the Mind toward <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> than the U&s;e of that general confu&s;ed Term.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, <HI>Philonous,</HI> &s;ince I am con|tent to give up the Notion of an unthink|ing Sub&s;tance exterior to the Mind, I think you ought not to deny me the Privilege of
<PB N="164" REF="177">
u&s;ing the Word <HI>Matter</HI> as I plea&s;e, and an|nexing it to a Collection of &s;en&s;ible Quali|ties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting only in the Mind. I freely own, there is no other Sub&s;tance, in a &s;trict Sen&s;e, than <HI>Spirit.</HI> But I have been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to the Term <HI>Matter,</HI> that I know not how to part with it. To &s;ay, There is no <HI>Matter</HI> in the World, is &s;till &s;hocking to me. Whereas, to &s;ay, There is no <HI>Matter,</HI> if, by that Term be meant, an unthinking Sub&s;tance exi&s;ting without the Mind: But, if by <HI>Matter</HI> is meant &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Thing, who&s;e Exi&s;tence con&s;i&s;ts in being perceived, then there is <HI>Matter.</HI> This Di&s;tinction gives it quite another Turn: And Men will come into your Notions, with &s;mall Difficulty, when they are propo&s;ed in that manner. For, after all, the Controver&s;y about <HI>Matter,</HI> in the &s;trict Acceptation of it, lies altoge|ther between you and the Philo&s;ophers; who&s;e Principles, I acknowlege, are not near &s;o natural, or &s;o agreeable to the com|mon Sen&s;e of Mankind, and Holy Scripture, as yours. There is nothing we either de|&s;ire or &s;hun, but as it makes, or is appre|hended to make, &s;ome Part of our Happi|ne&s;s or Mi&s;ery. But what has Happine&s;s, or Mi&s;ery, Joy or Grief, Plea&s;ure or Pain, to do with ab&s;olute Exi&s;tence, or with un|known Entities, ab&s;tracted from all Relation
<PB N="165" REF="178">
to us? It is evident, Things regard us only as they are plea&s;ing or di&s;plea&s;ing: And they can plea&s;e or di&s;plea&s;e, only &s;o far forth as they are perceived. Farther, therefore, we are not concerned; and thus far, you leave things as you found them. Yet, &s;till there is &s;omething new in this Doctrine. It is plain, I do not now think with the Philo&s;ophers, nor yet altogether with the Vulgar.
