<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THo&s;e who are acquainted with Mr. <HI>A&s;hmole</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t Noble Order of the Garter,</HI> will ea&s;ily &s;atisfy them&s;elves; that no Pains or Indu&s;try was wanting to Perfect and Complete &s;o Vo|luminous a Work: He had the Encourage|ment of a very gracious Prince, and the u&s;e of publick Records, more particularly the &s;e|veral Books of the <HI>Order,</HI> with the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal MSS wrote by the Offi|cers of Arms, who bore Part in the Cere|monies, or went on Emba&s;&s;ies to Stranger Kings, Princes, &amp;c. and by their con&s;tant Ob&s;ervations, were familiarly ver&s;ed in all its Laws and Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>The&s;e were very great helps to him, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed his own elaborate Study had not le&s;s owing to it. There is nothing that has relation to this <HI>mo&s;t Noble Or|der,</HI> which he has not touched on; and indeed
<PB REF="8">
it is a Work &s;o very copious, that he does him&s;elf acknowledge he has in&s;erted &s;ome things of little importance; which he de&s;ires may be con&s;idered to be done, to gratify &s;ome few, who have a more immediate concern therein.</P>
<P>The Reader will in this Treati&s;e find little el&s;e omitted: A very painful and exact A|bridgment has been made, many Corrections of the Author's, which he &s;aw before his Death, and left among his other Books in his Li|brary at <HI>Oxford,</HI> are here carefully al|tered; &s;ome Additions are made, a Li&s;t continued, of the &s;everal <HI>Knights-Com|panions,</HI> as well as Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> for above forty Years; and the Coats of Arms of abundance of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> vi&s;ibly corrected from good Authorities; and every di&s;tinct Chapter treated of at large; &s;o that this Work has not been compleated but at great Labour as well as Expence, which could not have been &s;upported, but for the Encouragement &s;ome of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> of the <HI>mo&s;t Noble Order</HI> were plea&s;ed to give it; as well in their Sub&s;criptions, as in the good Opinion they &s;eemed to Expre&s;s of the De&s;ign.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>_IT was, undoubtedly, a good Sentiment in the fir&s;t Collector of this Learned Work, to introduce, as well as a Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Knighthood</HI> in general, a Treati&s;e of all the &s;everal <HI>Orders</HI> that have prevail'd in other Parts of the World; for the&s;e in their Ri&s;e and In&s;titutions, having a relative Sen&s;e to the particular Subject he was to illu&s;trate, &s;eemed to afford him a very good Opportunity of doing it, by building on &s;o convenient a Foundation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore, (tho' much more confin'd to bre|vity) follow the &s;ame Method, making it &s;erve as a proper Introduction; there being many Things in the voluminous Original, which I conceive may with le&s;s Inconveniency be di&s;penc'd with.</P>
<P>IT was a con&s;tant Maxim in all well-regulated Go|vernments, to give a ju&s;t Encouragement to Merit, and this by proportioning Rewards to the Service done; for Merit mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to con&s;i&s;t in the Performance
<PB N="2" REF="10">
of &s;ome Vertuous or Heroick Action, directed for the publick Good: And as Vertue is either Mili|tary or Civil, &s;o the Di&s;tribution of Rewards is diffe|rent; either by be&s;towing Degrees and Titles of Ho|nour, or by Donations of Wealth; &s;o that in either Con&s;truction, Vertue may have its proper and &s;uitable Reward.</P>
<P>BUT the proper Reward of Military <HI>Vertue,</HI> is Ho|nour: (to which di&s;tinct Head this Work is confin'd.) Honour, which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls the <HI>Greate&s;t of exteriour Goods:</HI> And being an Object of a nobler Ambition than the Accumulation of Wealth, is principally the Aim of that <HI>Vertue</HI> we under&s;tand by <HI>Valour;</HI> which &s;prings from more generous Spirits, and hath been the con&s;tant Foundation of rai&s;ing Men to the highe&s;t Eminence of Glory, and &s;uperiour Dignity.</P>
<P>BUT that Fame might not lo&s;e it &s;elf in an unbounded Notion, it was at length thought fit to reduce Honour into Form and Order, by inve&s;ting the Per&s;on meriting with &s;ome particular Title or Appellation of Excellence, (the Original of all Nobility;) of which Knighthood, as it hath been accounted the mo&s;t &s;uitable Reward to the greate&s;t Vertue, &s;o it hath been e&s;teemed the chief and primary Honour among many Nations.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans</HI> held Honour and Vertue in that E&s;teem, that they deify'd, and dedicated Temples to them: They made them &s;o contiguous in their Situation, that there was no other Pa&s;&s;age to that of Honour, but thro' the Temple of Vertue, my&s;tically admoni&s;hing, that Honour was not to be attained by any other Way.</P>
<P>IN &s;everal of the <HI>Roman</HI> Coins we &s;ee Honour and Vertue repre&s;ented together in one Rever&s;e, and in one Medal; the Face of Honour &s;o &s;hadows that of Vertue, that but a little of it appears, <HI>Honour being the more illu&s;tri|ous of the two; and where we behold any Per&s;on outwardly adorned with it, we are to judge him inwardly endued with Vertue, ina&s;much as Honour is his due, and ju&s;tly be&s;towed upon him.</HI></P>

<P>&sect;. 3. UPON a more &s;ub&s;tantial Ba&s;is we &s;hall de&s;cend to the <HI>Romans;</HI> among whom, in the very Infancy of their Military Glory, a Society of Knights was in&s;tituted, immediately after their Union with the <HI>Sabines. Romulus</HI> inrolled <HI>Centuriae tres Equitum,</HI> three Centuries of Knights, out of the chiefe&s;t Families, whom he ap|pointed to be his Life-guard, and called them <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">leres,</HI> from their Activity and Di&s;patch in Martial Affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Tarquinius Pri&s;cus</HI> made an Addition to the&s;e Centu|ries; the like did <HI>Servius Tullius,</HI> who ordained, that tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;ucceed in that Body, &s;hould be elected <HI>ex cen&s;u, viz.</HI> from a con&s;iderable and certain Valuation of their E&s;tates, who had the greate&s;t Cen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, and were of the mo&s;t Noble Families, &s;ays <HI>Dyony&s;. Ha|licarn.</HI> And &s;oon after, the Eque&s;trian Cla&s;s began to be formed and con&s;tituted one of the three Orders of the Commonwealth, which were thus rank'd, according to <HI>Livy: Senatus, Ordo Eque&s;tris &amp; Plebs;</HI> which in the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Literal Notes is &s;et down after this Manner: CON. SEN. E. ORD. P. Q. R. And fora&s;much as this Degree is placed between the <HI>Patricians,</HI> or Senators, and the <HI>Plebeians,</HI> it an&s;wers exactly the State of our Knights between the Nobility and Commonalty: And from this Order, to the Height of Nobility which re&s;ided in the Senators, was the Way prepared; <HI>Junius Brutus</HI> being the fir&s;t who was rai&s;ed to a Senator from the Eque&s;trian Order.</P>
<P>IT was a Con&s;titution, as old as <HI>Tib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rius</HI>'s Reign, that none &s;hould be admitted, unle&s;s Free-born, or a Gentle|man for three Generations; and, indeed, for a long Time none were elected Knights but the be&s;t Sort of Gentlemen, and Per&s;ons of Extraction, as was the il|lu&s;trious <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cenas.</HI></P>

<P>who a&s;pired no higher, not out of any Incapacity of attaining greater Honours, but that he de&s;ired them not, &s;ays <HI>Paterculus:</HI> Yet at length, thro' Corruption of Times, <HI>Plebeians</HI> and Freedmen being too frequently re|ceived into this Degree (too near a Parallel among the Knights of this Age) occa&s;ion'd their Power to grow le&s;s and le&s;s, 'till it &s;hrunk to nothing; &s;o that the Pla|ces and Offices of Judges which they before had execu|ted, became conferrable upon the <HI>Publicans.</HI> And when <HI>Cicero</HI> was Con&s;ul, <HI>anno ab urbe conditi</HI> 690, the Eque&s;trian Order &s;tood in need of Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, whereupon they were then incorporated into that Commonwealth in the third Degree, all Acts pa&s;&s;ing <HI>in the Name of the Senate, the People of</HI> Rome, <HI>and the Eque&s;trian Order.</HI></P>
<P>They often enjoy'd Abroad the Government of &s;everal Provinces, whereof <HI>Egypt</HI> had this peculiar to it&s;elf, that none of the Senators were admitted, but only tho&s;e of the Eque&s;trian Order, who&s;e Decrees <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> com|manded to be had in like Regard, as if the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Rome,</HI> or Kings, Con&s;uls, or Praetors, had pronoun|ced them.</P>
<P>AS a Mark of Eminence, they had the Titles of <HI>Splendidi</HI> and <HI>Illu&s;tres</HI> be&s;towed upon them, and &s;ome|times have been called <HI>mo&s;t &s;acred</HI> Knights.</P>
<P>AND be&s;ides other Privileges, they had Seats with the Senators in the <HI>Circus Maximus;</HI> and by the <HI>Ro&s;cian</HI> Law, &s;at next them in the Theatres: They had likewi&s;e a College called <HI>Collegium Equitum;</HI> and Temples were dedicated to the Godde&s;s <HI>Fortune,</HI> under the Title of <HI>Eque&s;tri Fortunae.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn the Dignity and Honours of the E|que&s;trian Order among the <HI>Romans,</HI> we &s;hall now touch upon the Degrees of Knighthood which have been Per&s;onal, and may be comprehended under the Modern Title of <HI>Equites Aurati,</HI> or <HI>Milites Simplices,</HI> (as di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd from the &s;everal Orders of Chivalry, in&s;tituted in Chri&s;tendom.) In the Circum&s;tance of who&s;e Crea|tion we confe&s;s, nothing in the <HI>Roman Ordo Eque&s;tris</HI> hath place, tho' that might be the Ground and Original of the Dignity, and one common End in both, namely, the Pur&s;uit of Military Exploits, and Service in the Wars.</P>

<P>&sect;. 4. OF the Degrees of Knighthood. We &s;hall fir&s;t of the <HI>Monozons, i. e.</HI> Knights begirt with the Military Girdle, a Cu&s;tom devolved to the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Gauls</HI> from ancient Times, and from them to After-Ages.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> notes, <HI>That the late Emperors conferred the Dignity af Knighthood with the Military Girdle in&s;tead of all other Arms, becau&s;e that Part more eminent amongst them girdeth, &s;upporteth, and adorneth the re&s;t;</HI> whence <HI>Selden</HI> calls this Girding the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of the Cere|mony. Nor do we find among the various Ceremonies of <HI>Knighthood</HI> any that have continued &s;o con&s;tant in Practice as the endowing with Girdle and Sword, Or|naments proper to the Dignity and Marks of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> with which the Statues and Portraitures of <HI>Knights,</HI> on their Grave-&s;tones have been adorned.</P>
<P>FOR as at this Day <HI>Knights</HI> are &s;tyled <HI>Equites Aurati,</HI> from the Golden Spurs, heretofore put on at their Creation, &s;o were they more anciently <HI>Singulo Miletari donati,</HI> in re&s;pect, when any one was <HI>Knighted,</HI> he was not only &s;mitten with the Sword, but inve&s;ted with Sword and Belt, yet retain'd at the creating our Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> as the old Formulary thus hath it; Then &s;hall the King of great Favour take the Sword, and gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">quire therewith.</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Baccalaurei</HI> or Knights Batchelors, are to be con&s;ider'd, who are indifferently &s;tyled <HI>Chevaliers, Milites, Equites Aurati,</HI> and <HI>Knights.</HI> This Degree is truly accounted the fir&s;t of all Military Dignity, and the Foundation of all Honours in our Nation, and is deri|ved from, if not the &s;ame with that immediately pre|ceding. For as the Ceremony of a gentle Touch on the Shoulder with the flat Side of the Sword hath been &s;ince u&s;ed, in&s;tead of girting with the Sword and Belt, (e&s;pecially in Times of War, or in Ha&s;te) as an Initia|tion into the Military Order; &s;o on the contrary, it is not unu&s;ual now-adays, for the Prince, at lea&s;t <HI>Gladi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> if not <HI>Cingulo donare;</HI> for he oftentimes be&s;tows the Sword upon the Per&s;on he <HI>Knigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Miraeus</HI> gives them the Epithet <HI>Aurati,</HI> from the Pri|vilege of wearing Gold upon their Swords and Spurs, omitting <HI>Tiraquel</HI>'s fanciful Di&s;tinction between <HI>Miles</HI> and <HI>Eques Auratus,</HI> who allows the former to &s;ignify a Knight Noble before, and the other to deno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e one whom we call a Knight and no Gentleman, or applicable to the <HI>Neapo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">an</HI> Gentlemen, (u&s;ually called <HI>Cavali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ri)</HI> who
<PB N="6" REF="14">
are all &s;tyled <HI>Equites,</HI> tho' they never have attained the Knightly Dignity.</P>
<P>THE third Sort were <HI>Knights Banerets,</HI> who &s;o well de|&s;erv'd in the Wars, that they were afterwards permitted to u&s;e <HI>Vexillum quadratum,</HI> a &s;quare Banner, whence they were called <HI>Equites vexillarii,</HI> or <HI>Chevaliers a Buniere</HI> from the Dutch <HI>Banerheere,</HI> Lord or Ma&s;ter of the Banner.</P>
<P><HI>Camden</HI> conceives this Title fir&s;t devis'd by K. <HI>Edward</HI> 3. in Recompence of Martial Prowe&s;s; a Recital of which Dignity is mention'd in a Patenr 20 <HI>E.</HI> 3. to <HI>John Coup|land,</HI> for his Service, in taking <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> Pri|&s;oner. But it was much more ancient with us, as well as in <HI>France;</HI> and they had particular Robes, and other Ornaments given them from the Crown, <HI>ad apparatum &s;uum pro militia, tanquam pro Baneretto, a Rege &s;u&s;cipienda,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>viz. ad unum Tunicam,</HI> &amp;c. after which is &s;et down the particular Robes, and other Ornaments appointed for his Creation.</P>
<P>To &s;hew this Dignity yet more ancient, there is the Evidence of a Writ in K. <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d's Time, for furni&s;hing <HI>Thomas Bardolf</HI> with the Robes of a <HI>Baneret.</HI> It is an Ho|nour e&s;teemed the la&s;t among the Greate&s;t, <HI>viz. Nobilitum Majorum,</HI> or the Fir&s;t of the Second Rank; and is placed in the Middle between the <HI>Barons</HI> and the other <HI>Knights;</HI> in which re&s;pect the <HI>Baneret</HI> may be called <HI>Vexillarius minor,</HI> as if he were the le&s;&s;er <HI>Banner-Bearer;</HI> to the End he might be &s;o differenced from the Greater, namely the <HI>Baron,</HI> to whom the Right of bearing a &s;quare Banner doth belong.</P>
<P>BUT there are &s;ome remarkable differences between the&s;e Knights and Knights-Batchelors; as in the Occa|&s;ions and Circum&s;tances of their Creations, the <HI>Baneret</HI> being not Created, unle&s;s at a Time when the King's Standard is erected, and that he bears his own Banner in the Field; whil&s;t the <HI>Knight-Batchelor</HI> follows that which is anothers.</P>
<P>THIS farther difference is ob&s;erved between them, that the <HI>Knight-Baneret</HI> had &s;o many Gentlemen his Ser|vants at Command, as that he could rai&s;e a Banner, and make up a Company of Soldiers to be maintained at his Table, and with his own Pay: But the <HI>Knight-Batchelor</HI> had not &s;ufficient for this, and therefore marched under the Banner of another; and the Wages of the <HI>Baneret</HI> were double.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="15">
N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">XT to the&s;e, we are to mention Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> which is a Degree that hath the Inve&s;titure and Title of Knight, with an additional Denomination, derived from Part of the Ceremony of his Creation. It is the general receiv'd Opinion, that our K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. fir&s;t in&s;tituted the&s;e Knights, which is ju&s;tify'd by Sir <HI>John Froi&s;ard,</HI> who &s;ays he created 46 of them at his Coronation, chu&s;ing them from &s;uch, as were either his Favorites, or had preten&s;ions to it from their per|&s;onal Merits, or Services.</P>
<P>BUT if the Ceremonies and Circum&s;tances of their Creation be well con&s;ider'd, it may be inferr'd, that he rather re&s;tor'd the ancient way of making Knights, than In&s;tituted them; and con&s;equently that the Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> are really no other than <HI>Knights-Batchelors;</HI> that is, &s;uch as are created with tho&s;e Ceremonies, wherewith <HI>Knights-Batchelors</HI> were formerly created by Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks: But &s;ome of them having been laid a&s;ide, were then brought again into U&s;e, and made peculiar to this Degree, and &s;ince continued to them upon &s;ome &s;olemn and great Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t View they look like a di&s;tinct Order of Knighthood; but cannot be &s;o accounted, becau&s;e they have no Statutes a&s;&s;igned them, nor are in Ca&s;e of Va|cancy, &s;upply'd, (the E&s;&s;entials of di&s;tinct Orders) nor do they wear their Robes beyond the Time of that Oc|ca&s;ion upon which they were created; as chiefly, the Coronation of a King or Queen, the Creation of a Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and the like; whereas al&s;o their Number is uncertain, and always at the Plea&s;ure of the King.</P>
<P><HI>Favine</HI> calls them Knights of the Crown, becau&s;e, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from E&s;quires, they wore upon their Left Shoulder an E&s;cutcheon of Black Silk embroider'd with three Crowns of Gold; but therein he mi&s;takes, for they never u&s;ed only a Silk Lace, and the Jewel they wore was made of Gold, containing three Crowns, with this Motto <HI>Tria juncta in una,</HI> hanging down under the left Arm at a Carnation Ribbon worn cro&s;s the Body.</P>
<P>THIS leads us to the Degree of Baronets, who &s;eem allied to Knighthood, by having granted them the Ad|dition of <HI>Sir</HI> to be &s;et before their Names: But this gives them not the Dignity of Knighthood; nor can they properly be flyled Knights, until they be actually Knighted.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16">
IT is a Degree erected <HI>Anno</HI> 9. <HI>Jac.</HI> 1. and the Grant made by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> It is Hereditary to them, and the Heirs Male of their Bodies lawfully begotten, for ever; and by a &s;ub&s;equent Decree of the &s;aid King, Precedence is granted to them before all Banerets, except &s;uch as &s;hould be made by the King under his Standard, di&s;|play'd in an Army Royal in open War, and the King per&s;onally pre&s;ent, and next to and immediately after the younger Sons of Vi&s;count and Barons.</P>
<P>THE Ground for erecting this Degree was partly Martial; for tho' them&s;elves were not enjoined per&s;onal Service in the Wars, yet each Baronet was to maintain thirty Foot Soldiers for three Years in <HI>Ireland,</HI> after the rate of Eight Pence <HI>per</HI> Day, for the Defence of that Kingdom, and chiefly to &s;ecure the Plantation of <HI>Ul&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>THEY were at lea&s;t to be de&s;cended from a Grand|father, on the Father's Side, that bore Arms, and had a Revenue of 1000 l. <HI>per Ann.</HI> or Lands of old Rents of equal Value with 1000 l. <HI>per Ann.</HI> of improv'd Lands, or at lea&s;t two Parts of three of &s;uch E&s;tate in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the other third in Rever&s;ion Expectant upon one Life held only in Jointure.</P>
<P>THE Year after, King <HI>James</HI> I. added &s;ome new Pri|vileges and Ornaments, <HI>viz.</HI> to Knight tho&s;e already made that were no Knights; and the Heirs hereafter of every Baronet &s;hould, at the Age of One and Twenty Years, receive Knighthood; likewi&s;e that all Baronets might bear in Canton, or in an Ine&s;cutcheon, the Arms of <HI>Ul&s;ter;</HI> and farther, to have place in the Armies of the King in the Gro&s;s, near about the Royal Standard.</P>
<P>SINCE the In&s;titution of Baronets in <HI>England,</HI> there have been made divers in <HI>Ireland</HI> after the like Form: And the Knights of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> were ordained in Imitation of Baronets in <HI>England</HI> by the &s;aid King <HI>James, A. D.</HI> 1622. for the Planting that Coun|try by <HI>Scotch</HI> Colonies, and the Degree made likewi&s;e Hereditary.</P>
<P>THESE latter wear an Orange Tawny Ribbon as their Badge, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from other Knights; and it appears, there was an Intention, 1627. to move his then Maje&s;ty, that all Baronets and Knights Bachelors might wear Ribbons of &s;everal Colours, &s;ome Badge or Jewel, in &s;uch Sort as did the Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other: But that Matter dropt.</P>

THE En&s;igns of the Eque&s;trian Order among the <HI>Romans,</HI> by which they were made, was a Publick Hor&s;e, or a Gold Ring; yet &s;till, to tho&s;e who had Eque&s;trian Cen&s;e, the Hor&s;e was the ancienter Badge of the two; but when thro' the Multitude of the&s;e Knights no Publick Hor&s;es were a&s;&s;igned, but to &s;uch who were ready to enter upon Military Service, and to

fight in the Legions, &s;uch were called <HI>Legionary Knights,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the re&s;t, who had only receiv'd the Honour of a Gold-Ring; for they were not all employ'd in Wars.</P>
<P>THE Cen&s;or (after the In&s;titution of that Offiee <HI>ab urbe condita,</HI> 310.) and afterwards the Emperor, were the Per&s;ons who be&s;towed this <HI>Equus Militaris,</HI> or <HI>Pub|licus,</HI> as it was called from the Annual Allowance, to keep him, which they gave unto tho&s;e of known Ver|tue and approv'd Life, compelling him to &s;erve in the Wars, tho' again&s;t his Will; (but in the more ancient Method of Election, Con&s;traint was not u&s;ed.) And upon Negligence in the Care of the&s;e Hor&s;es, or any Blemi&s;h, Reproach, or Infamy, or Lo&s;s of Patrimony in the Knights, the Hor&s;es were not only taken away, but the Knights wholly disfranchis'd. <HI>Ro&s;inus</HI> laying down the Manner and Order u&s;ed in ejecting &s;uch Knights, adds, <HI>A Recital being made of all the Knights that were inrolled, tho&s;e who&s;e Names he omitted, were thereby un|der&s;tood to be depriv'd of that Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN they had &s;erved in the Wars the Time appoint|ed by Law, it was the Cu&s;tom to lead their Hor&s;es by the Bridle into the Forum, before the <HI>Duumvirs</HI> [Cen|&s;ors,] and giving an Account under whom and what Generals or Captains they had &s;erved; they were thereupon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from farther Service in the Wars: An Example whereof <HI>Plutarch</HI> relates to have been given by <HI>Pompey</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT whereas among the <HI>Roman</HI> In&s;criptions we find <HI>Equo publico honoratus donatus, ornatus,</HI> and <HI>exornatus,</HI> &s;uch is not to be con&s;trued to be of Eque&s;trian Dignity, but only to have received the <HI>praemia militaria,</HI> with which the Emperors u&s;ed to recompen&s;e &s;ome particular Ex|ploit, by the Honour of &s;uch a Gift, according to <HI>Sal|ma&s;ius.

<P>AMONG the <HI>Germans,</HI> the Shield and Lance were ac|counted the grand Badges of Military Honour, or Knighthood. This the <HI>Lombards,</HI> the <HI>Franks,</HI> and our Country-men, all de&s;cending out of <HI>Germany,</HI> u&s;ed, and was to us (in the Opinion of Sir <HI>Hen.

<P>ANOTHER En&s;ign and Ornament of Knightly Honour is, the <HI>Cingulum militare.</HI> or <HI>Balteus,</HI> which, <HI>Varro</HI> &s;ays, is <HI>Tu&s;can,</HI> &s;ignifying a military Girdle, which were garni&s;hed with great Buckles, Studs, and Rings of pure Gold, to &s;hew their Dignity and Power in military Com|mands; and with &s;uch a Belt, &s;et with Pearls and precious Stones, young <HI>Athel&s;tan</HI> was girded, when he receiv'd <HI>Knighthood</HI> from his Grandfather King <HI>Alfred.</HI> Our Knights were no le&s;s anciently known by the&s;e Belts, than by their gilt Swords, Spurs, &amp;c.

<P>To this Belt was al&s;o added a Sword, not of Ordinary U&s;e; and therefore termed the Sword of a <HI>Knight,</HI> which was hallowed with great Ceremony.</P>
<P>ANOTHER eminent Badge is the Golden Spurs, where|with, at the Time of their Creation, Knights Spurs were wont to be adorned; and to the&s;e, a little after the Conque&s;t, were added far more and greater Oruaments. They were u&s;ually put on after the Per&s;on had been

pre&s;ented to the Prince who gave the Honour, to &s;ignify, that the new-made Knight &s;hould not only declare his Valour by his Sword, but al&s;o by the Management of his Hor&s;e, which he &s;hould encourage and excite with his Spurs, to the carrying on his valiant De&s;igns. The&s;e Spurs have been of that E&s;teem, that Knight Batchelors are latinized <HI>Equites aurati;</HI> among the <HI>Germans, Ritter de&s;s Gulden Sporns;</HI> and with us heretofore, <HI>Knights of the Spurs:</HI> And &s;everal Families by the Name of <HI>Knight,</HI> bear for their Arms the Spurs on a Canton.</P>
<P>IT is farther certify'd among the Rights of a Knight Baneret, that upon the Account of his Knighthood he may wear gilt Spurs, as well as a gilt Sword; and that the Spurs are e&s;&s;ential, may be collected from the De|gradation of a Knight, where his gilt Spurs are fir&s;t cut off with an Hatchet, the Ca&s;e of Sir <HI>Andra Harcla.</HI> In the la&s;t Place is the Collar, an En&s;ign of Knightly Dig|nity among the <HI>Germans, Gauls, Britons, Danes</HI> and <HI>Goths,</HI> among whom it was cu&s;tomary to wear them, as deno|ting &s;uch as were remarkable for their Valour.

The fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Kings at giving this Belt ki&s;&s;ed the new Knight on the Left Cheek, &s;aying, <HI>In the Honour of the Father, and the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, I make you a Knight.</HI> It was called <HI>O&s;culum pacis,</HI> the Ki&s;s of Favour, or Bro|therhood, and is pre&s;umed to be the Accollade, or Cere|mony of Imbracing, which <HI>Charles</HI> the Great u&s;ed when he Knighted his Son <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bonair.</HI> It was in the Time of the &s;ame Emperor, the Way of Knighting by the <HI>Colaphum,</HI> or Blow on the Ear, u&s;ed in Sign of &s;u&s;taining future Hard&s;hips, which is thought to have been deriv'd from the Manner of Manumi&s;&s;ion of a Slave among the <HI>Romans;</HI> a Cu&s;tom long after retained in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> Thus <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who was to be Knighted before he could be <HI>Emperor,</HI> at his being elected King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> received Knighthood by the Box of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he Ear, &amp;c. from <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia, A.

<P>IN the Time of the <HI>Saxons</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> Knights re|ceived their In&s;titutions at the Hands of Great <HI>Prelates</HI> or <HI>Abbots;</HI> which, according to their Opinion, render'd them more au&s;picious.

And the like religious Ceremony was heretofore ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Spain</HI> at the Crea|tion of Knights, whether <HI>Cavelleros de E&s;puela d' Orada,</HI> or <HI>Amados</HI> [our Knights Batchelors,] In this Form, the Per&s;on to be Knighted was bathed in the Evening, and pre&s;ently laid in Bed; then cloathed in rich Robes, and led to the Church to perform his Vigils: That being over, and Ma&s;s heard, his Spurs were put on, and his Sword girt about him, then drawn out, and put into his Right Hand; whereupon the Oath was forthwith admini&s;tred to him; which taken, he that be&s;towed the Dignity gave him <HI>una Pe&s;conade,</HI> a Blow, or Stroke on the Neck, &s;aying, God a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the Performance of your Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Oath or Vow the Knights profe&s;&s;ed, was in ge|neral, to relieve and protect Widows, the Fatherle&s;s, Oppre&s;&s;ed and Mi&s;erable, and to defend the Church of God; which to keep and perform was e&s;teem'd as meri|torious, as to do all that a Monk, Frier, or Canon Regular &s;hould.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o mention (by Mr. <HI>Selden)</HI> of con&s;ecrating the Sword, offering it at the Altar, and receiving it again from thence, as an implicit Kind of taking an Oath. But as in Peace and great Lei&s;ure the&s;e tedious Ceremo|nies were u&s;ed, yet it was otherwi&s;e in Times of War, or on a Day of Battle, where Hurry and Throng of Affairs would not permit; and therefore, as well be|fore the joining of Battle, as after Victory obtained, it was u&s;ual for the Prince or General in the Field, on Sight of the Army, to give tho&s;e whom he thought fit to advance to that Honour (they humbly kneeling be|fore him) a Stroke with a naked Sword flatwi&s;e upon their Shoulders, or el&s;e to touch their Heads or Shoul|ders lightly, without any other Ceremony, except pronouncing <HI>Sis Eques in nomine Dei;</HI> to which he adds, <HI>Ri&s;e, Sir&mdash;Knight,</HI> or in the <HI>French, Sus,</HI> or <HI>Sois, Che|valier, au nom de Dieu,</HI> which we commonly call Dubbing, the old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Word u&s;ed for Creating [Con&s;ecrating] a Knight, from <HI>doopen</HI> to dip, by Bathing.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Manner of creating Knights Abroad was, by Royal Codicils, or Letters Patents (the&s;e the <HI>Spaniards</HI>

call <HI>Privilegios de Cavelleria)</HI> whereupon &s;uch Knights are intitled <HI>Equites Codicellares;</HI> and the&s;e were &s;ent to &s;uch as dwelt in remote Countries, and &s;ometimes, but rarely, extended &s;o as to make the Degree heredi|tary.

<P>HAVING thus briefly &s;hew'd the various Forms of Crea|tion of <HI>Knights Batchelors,</HI> I &s;hall remark what <HI>Seld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> has ob&s;erv'd of <HI>Knights Bannerets</HI> in later Times, wherein he that was advanc'd to that Honour in the Field, was in|ducted between two Senior Knights with Trumpets be|fore them, and the Heralds carrying a long Banner of his Arms, call'd a <HI>Penon;</HI> in which Manner being brou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ht to the King or Lieutenant, who bidding him good Suc|ce&s;s, the Tip of the Banner is cut off, that of an Obl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ng it might become a Square, like the Banner of a Baron: This done, he returns to his Tent, conducted as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|fore.

<P>&sect; 1. THE Grounds and Cau&s;es of founding <HI>Socie|ties</HI> or <HI>Knightly Orders,</HI> were &s;everal and different, tho' all terminated in one End. Among which, principally were the&s;e, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A &s;incere Love to <HI>Honour,</HI> and therein chiefly to excite and pro|mote <HI>Vertue</HI> by &s;uitable Rewards; &s;uch was the De&s;ign of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> when he formed him&s;elf and other Martial Men into a Fellow&s;hip, which he &s;tiled <HI>Knights of the Round Table. Secondly,</HI> To repre&s;s the Incur&s;ions and Robberies of the <HI>Saracens</HI> and <HI>Barbarians,</HI> to vindicate the Oppre&s;&s;ed, redeem the En&s;laved, and to entertain and relieve Pilgrims and Strangers, which were Part of the Duties the <HI>Knights Ho&s;pitallers</HI> and <HI>Templars,</HI> &amp;c. &s;tood engag'd in. A <HI>third</HI> Rea&s;on was, To Fight in Defence of the Chri&s;tian Faith, again&s;t Pagans and Infidels; to enlarge the Chri&s;tian Territories, and promote the Service of the Catholick Church: And indeed their Zeal very much advanced Chri&s;tianity. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> When Sovereign Princes perceived them&s;elves embroiled in Wars or dangerous Factions, the erecting &s;uch an Order or Society was, that they might by &s;uch a Tye re&s;tore Peace, quiet all Jealou&s;ies, unite Affecti|ons, and &s;ecure a la&s;ting Friend&s;hip and powerful A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, both for their own and their Country's Safety. And to this End were Badges of &s;everal Orders devi&s;ed, as Pledges of Remembrance to quicken and e&s;tabli&s;h their Friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>&sect; 3. THE In&s;titutions of the latter Sort were after a while thought too weak to continue, if not &s;u&s;tained

<P>BEFORE the taking of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> from the <HI>Saracens,</HI> certain Chri&s;tian Merchants of <HI>Naples</HI> obtain'd leave from the Caliph of <HI>Egypt</HI> to erect a &s;mall and conve|nient Hou&s;e, for the Entertainment of them&s;elves and Countrymen, which they built before the Church of the <HI>Holy Sepulchre,</HI> together with a &s;mall Oratory.

They carry'd as many Rolls as they had done gallant Exploits in the Wars; and the King him&s;elf and his Sons were of this Order; which <HI>Pur|chas</HI> calls <HI>Eagle Knights.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THERE was another Order, call'd <HI>Of the Lyons and Tygers.</HI> The&s;e Knights being commonly the mo&s;t vali|ant in the Wars, always bore with them their Badges and Armories.</P>
<P N="3">3. OTHER Knights there were, as <HI>The Grey Knights,</HI> not &s;o much re&s;pected as the re&s;t. They had their Hair cut round about the Ears: They made War upon their Enemies with En&s;igns like other Knights, and were only arm'd to the Girdle, while the mo&s;t Ho|nourable were <HI>Cap-a-Pee'd.</HI> All Knights might carry Gold and Silver, be array'd in rich Cotton, have the u&s;e of painted and gilt Ve&s;&s;els, and wear Shoes; but the common People only the earthen &s;ort; neither might they carry Shoes nor Attire them&s;elves, but in a gro&s;s Stuff. Every Order had their Lodging a&s;&s;ign'd them in the Palace, di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their proper En|&s;igns: The fir&s;t was the Lodging of the Prince, the &s;econd of <HI>Eagles,</HI> the third of <HI>Lyons and Tygers,</HI> and the fourth of <HI>Grey Knights.</HI></P>
<P>THE Province of <HI>Cinaloa</HI> (near <HI>New Mexico)</HI> created their Knights by giving a Bow, and &s;etting them to en|counter a Lyon or &s;ome other wild Bea&s;t.</P>

The Ceremonies being performed by boaring an Hole in the Ears, putting on gallant Shoes, and wearing of the Breeches, which before they were re&s;tricted, adorning their Heads with Flowers, and ha|ving the Privilege of an Herb that none but them&s;elves cou'd make u&s;e of, and la&s;tly giving an Axe into their Hands. <HI>Menenius</HI> calls the&s;e Knights <HI>Oreiones,</HI> from the <HI>Spani&s;h Orejas,</HI> flop or loll-eared, in the <HI>Latin Auri|culares,</HI> from the Leaf which they bore hanging in their Ears, or becau&s;e they only negotiated Affairs with the Emperor, and had his Ear at all times.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Japan</HI> there's an Order of Knights called <HI>Mengoras,</HI> part of whom are called <HI>Bonzees,</HI> living in Fraternities, as our Religioni&s;ts in <HI>Europe.</HI> Some of the&s;e have the Charge of their Idols, and the Service relating to their Temples, others follow the Wars.

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>HAving di&s;patch'd the &s;everal Orders of Knight|hood, and trac'd them from their proper Foun|tains, we come now to treat of the mo&s;t Noble Order of the <HI>Garter;</HI> an Order, that not only grants Merit, and Honourable, and Valiant Exploits at Home, but what Imperial Heads and Per&s;ons, fam'd for the An|tiquity of their Race, or Gallantry of Actions, have al|ways e&s;teem'd a further Advancement to their Glory therein to be enroll'd. For the better Explanation, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to begin with the De&s;cription of the Ca&s;tle, Chapel, and College of <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> The Place claims no greater Antiquity than of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> named by them <HI>Windle&s;hore,</HI> and, as <HI>Cambden</HI> conjectures, had the Denomination from the Winding of a Shore thereabouts, as did <HI>Wand&s;worth</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> heretofore written <HI>Wind|le&s;worth.</HI> The fir&s;t authentick Notice is from the Donation which King <HI>Edward the Confe&s;&s;or</HI> made thereof to the Monks of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> (as the Charter ex|pre&s;&s;es it) <HI>For the Hope of eternal Reward, the Remi&s;&s;ion of all his Sins, the Sins of his Father, Mother, and all his An|ce&s;tors, to the Prai&s;e of Almighty,</HI> &amp;c. he grants <HI>Wyndle|&s;hore,</HI> with all its Appurtenances, as an Endowment and perpetual Inheritance, to the U&s;e of the <HI>Monks</HI> there, and at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> that &s;erved GOD.

half an Hide of Land, and is there noted to be Parcel of the Mannor of <HI>[Clivore] Clure.</HI> This Ca&s;tle King <HI>Henry</HI> I. rebuilt, and beautified with great Magni|ficence, and, in the Tenth Year of his Reign, held his <HI>Whit&s;ontide</HI> there with great State and Splendor. Short|ly after, in a Charter of Peace between King <HI>Stephen</HI> and Duke <HI>Henry,</HI> (King <HI>Henry</HI> II. afterwards) this Ca&s;tle was called <HI>Mola de Winde&s;or,</HI> the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Winde&s;or.</HI> Within this Ca&s;tle was King <HI>Edward</HI> III. born, (com|monly called <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Wind&s;or)</HI> and was baptized in the old Chapel; and &s;o great was his Affection to that Place, that he con&s;tituted it the Seat of the mo&s;t noble Order of the <HI>Garter;</HI> and to embelli&s;h it the more, he founded the College of the Chapel of St. <HI>George,</HI> and much enlarged, and beautified the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>For this Work he appointed &s;everal Surveyors, whom he a&s;&s;igned to pre&s;s Hewers of Stone, Carpenters, and &s;uch other Artificers as were thought u&s;eful and nece&s;|&s;ary, as al&s;o to provide Stone, Timber, and all other Materials for them. <HI>William de Wyckham</HI> (who attained to be Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter)</HI> was one of the&s;e Supervi&s;ors, and had that Place conferr'd on him by Letters Patent, <HI>October</HI> 30. <HI>Ed.</HI> III.

<P N="1">1. THEN, King <HI>Edward</HI> III. out of the great Regard he had to military Honour, and tho&s;e who had bravely behav'd them&s;elves in his Wars, yet after chanced to fall in decay, made a Provi&s;ion for their Relief and com|fortable Sub&s;i&s;tence in old Age, by providing for them in this his Foundation, and making a Coalition in one joint Body with the Cu&s;tos and Canons; the&s;e he call'd <HI>Milites Pauperes,</HI> and we Poor or Alms-Knights. The &s;tated Number at fir&s;t were Twenty Four, equal to the Cu&s;tos and Canons at the fir&s;t Erection. But &s;hortly after, up|on his in&s;tituting the Order of the <HI>Garter,</HI> Two more were added (as there was to the fir&s;t Canons) to make the compleat Number of the Knights-Companions of that Order, which were Twenty Six, as we find &s;tated at the Ordination of the College by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Win|che&s;ter,</HI> the Pope's Delegate.</P>
<P>THE Intention of the Founder was for tho&s;e that were real Objects of Charity, as he de&s;cribes them, <HI>viz.</HI> poor Knights, infirm in Body, indigent and decay'd, or as the Statutes of the <HI>Garter</HI> qualifies them, &s;uch as thro' adver&s;e Turns of Fortune were reduced to that Extremity that they had not wherewithal to &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves, to live &s;o genteelly as was &s;uitable for a Military Condition, which for greater Caution was rei|terated in the Statutes of King <HI>Hen.</HI> V. King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and in the Orders of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> for it was ex|pre&s;s'd, in ca&s;e any E&s;tate of 20 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> devolved on them, &s;uch Knights were to be di&s;charged the Col|lege, and they were to proceed to a new Election.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t each Knight-Companion of the Order pre&s;ented his Alms-Knight, but ever after their Election was to be at the Di&s;po&s;al of the Sovereign. Their Habit
<PB N="96" REF="104">
was a Red Mantle, with the E&s;cutcheon of St. <HI>George,</HI> without any Garter to &s;urround it. Their Exhibition, after their fir&s;t Election was 12 <HI>d.</HI> a-piece every Day they were at Service in the Chapel, or re&s;ident in the College, be&s;ides 40 <HI>s. per Annum</HI> for other Contin|gencies, it being the &s;tated Allowance appointed to each of the Canons Re&s;idents.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Beginning of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VI's Reign, their <HI>quotidian</HI> Di&s;tributions and Annual 40 <HI>s.</HI> had been un|paid upon the Account of &s;ome Di&s;&s;entions ri&s;en between them and the Dean and Canons; but upon Complaint of <HI>John</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and Vi&s;itor of the College, 10 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. they were re|dre&s;&s;ed, and their Arrears of both di&s;charged, without any Deduction, and likewi&s;e obtained this Clau&s;e, That if the Trea&s;urer of the College became negligent in future Payments, he &s;hould lo&s;e his own <HI>Quotidians,</HI> from the Time of his voluntary Omi&s;&s;ion, and the &s;ame to be divided among the Alms-Knights. Their Duty was to pray for the Sovereign and the Knights Companions, to be every Day pre&s;ent at High Ma&s;s, the Ma&s;&s;es of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> at Ve&s;pers and Compline, and in default to be mulcted their 12 <HI>d. toties quoties,</HI> which was to be converted to the U&s;e of the other Alms-Knights, then re&s;iding in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> notwith&s;tanding which Decree, the Dean did afterwards break in upon them, and di&s;po&s;ed of the&s;e Forfeitures at his Plea&s;ure, till 2 <HI>Rich.</HI> II. <HI>Adam,</HI> Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>David</HI>'s, then Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and Vi&s;itor of the College, re|dre&s;s'd it, and another Complaint of like Nature being made of the Deans di&s;po&s;ing of Donations and other Liberalities of the Knights Companions in wrong of the Alms-Knights, this Chancellor decreed an equal Di|&s;tribution between the Alms-Knights and Canons, till the King and Council &s;hould otherwi&s;e determine.</P>
<P>The&s;e and other Differences between the Dean and Canons and Alms Knights, grew up to that height, that they became irreconcileable, in&s;omuch as in the Act of Parliament, 22 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. for incorporating of the Cu|&s;tos and Canons, by the Name of Dean and Canons, the Alms-Knights were not only omitted; but this Clau&s;e in&s;erted, <HI>That the Dean and Canons, and their Succe&s;&s;ors,</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="105">
<HI>&s;hould for ever more be utterly quit and di&s;charged from all manner of Exhibition or Charge of or for any of the &s;aid Knights.</HI> And this under the Cover, That the King has greatly augmented the Number of the Mini&s;ters of the Chapel, that the Revenue was in&s;ufficient to main|tain both them and the Alms-Knights; but in the Dean and Canons An&s;wer to the Knights Petition to repeal this Act, the Cau&s;e is alledged, For that &s;ome of the&s;e Knights u&s;ed their utmo&s;t Endeavours before this Act, to incorporate them&s;elves, and to be exempt from the Obedience and Rule of the Dean and Canons.</P>
<P>AFTER this Act, which &s;truck off their Quotidian Portions and Fees a&s;&s;igned by King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Foundati|on, how the Alms Knights &s;ub&s;i&s;ted we find not; but &s;o &s;oon as King <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. came to the Crown, they pe|titioned the King and Parliament for Repeal of the Act, 22 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. and alledged it was obtained without their Knowledge, or being called thereunto, which Plea a|vailed not at all; but on the contrary, the Dean and Canons, &s;ome Years after, got an Exemplification there|of under the great Seal, dated <HI>Feb.</HI> 4. 18 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII.</P>
<P>AND it is very evident from King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII's Letter to the College, that what they did in this Nature after this Act commenced, was merely upon Courte&s;ie; for he returns them Thanks for a Pen&s;ion of Twenty Marks conferred upon <HI>Peter Narbone,</HI> whom he had recom|mended to an Alms-Knights Place, and Promi&s;es to burthen them no more with Reque&s;ts of this &s;ort, but that he would &s;ettle Lands for their Maintenance. So great was their Caution, <HI>Narbone</HI> was by Covenants in|dented between him and the Dean and Canons, to re|linqui&s;h his Pen&s;ion upon that King's &s;ettling Lands on the College, for the Provi&s;ion of &s;uch Knights. In the Interval between the Di&s;union of the College and Alms-Knights, to their E&s;tabli&s;hment by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> their Habit and Badge continued the &s;ame, and was &s;o confirmed by <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII's Statutes.

<P>WE come now to treat of the mo&s;t Noble and Il|lu&s;trious <HI>Order of the Garter;</HI> which, if we con&s;i|der either its Antiquity, or the Noblene&s;s of the Per&s;onages, that have been enroll'd, it excels and outvies all other In&s;titutions of Honour in the whole World. It owes its Original, as is confe&s;&s;ed on all Hands, to <HI>Edward</HI> III. King of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> yet as to the Occa&s;ion, there are &s;everal Opinions which we &s;hall rectifie. The vulgar and more general is, that the Garter of <HI>Joan,</HI> Counte&s;s of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> dropping ca&s;ually off as &s;he danced in a &s;olemn Ball, King <HI>Edward</HI> &s;toop|ing took it up from the Ground, whereupon &s;ome of his Nobles &s;miling, as at an amorous Action, and he ob&s;erving their &s;portive Humour, turned it off with a Reply in <HI>French, Honi &s;oit qui mal y pen&s;e;</HI> but withal added, in di&s;dain of their Laughter, <HI>That &s;hortly th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;hould &s;ee that Garter advanced to &s;o high an Honour and Re|nown as to account them&s;elves happy to wear it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT upon Examination of this Tradition, let others judge what Credit it bears to e&s;tabli&s;h its Belief; for Sir <HI>John Froi&s;&s;art,</HI> the only Writer of the Age that treats
<PB N="120" REF="128">
of this In&s;titution, a&s;&s;igns no &s;uch Original, nor for 200 Years after is there any thing to the Purpo&s;e in our other Hi&s;torians, till <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> took occa&s;ion to &s;ay &s;omething of it; but had it been Fact, &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Hi&s;torian or other, would not have neglected to regi&s;ter it at a convenient Time with a Scoff and Ridicule, &s;ince that Nation was &s;o ready to deride King <HI>Henry</HI> V's De&s;ign of invading them with a Return of Tennis Balls.</P>
<P>IN the Original Statutes of this Order, there is not the lea&s;t Conjecture to countenance the Conceit of &s;uch a Feminine In&s;titution, no not &s;o much as laying an Obligation on the Knights-Companions to defend the Quarrels of Ladies (as &s;ome Orders then in being en|joyned;) nor doth the Author of that Tract entitled <HI>In|&s;titutio clari&s;&s;imi Ordinis Militaris a praenobili &s;ubligaculo nun|cupati,</HI> prefaced to the Black Book of the <HI>Garter,</HI> let fall the manife&s;t Pa&s;&s;age to ground it on.</P>
<P>As to what <HI>Polydore</HI> &s;ays, he is not &s;o confident to a&s;certain the Per&s;on who&s;e Garter it was; but cautiou&s;ly declining that, &s;ays, it was either the Queen's, or the King's Mi&s;tre&s;s's; and if it were the latter, yet doth he o|mit her Name and Title, both which (on what Authority we find not) are &s;upplied by modern Hi&s;torians, who call her <HI>Joan</HI> Counte&s;s of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> the &s;ame el&s;ewhere cele|brated by the Name of the <HI>Fair Maid</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> (whom <HI>Edward</HI> the Black Prince, afterward married) whereas no Hi&s;torian ever gave the lea&s;t Inuendo that King <HI>Edward</HI> III. ever courted her as a Mi&s;tre&s;s. <HI>Selden</HI> points at her when he calls the Lady, from whom the Garter &s;lipp'd, Counte&s;s of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Salisbury:</HI> But about the Time when this Order was founded &s;he in truth was dignified with neither Honour; for altho' &s;he was Daughter to <HI>Tho.</HI> of <HI>Wood&s;tock,</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> and had been &s;ometime the re|puted Wife of <HI>William Mountague,</HI> &s;econd Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> yet then &s;he cou'd not properly be accounted Counte&s;s of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> She was actually Wife to Sir <HI>Thomas Hol|land,</HI> (one of the Fir&s;t Founders of the Order.)

THAT there was a Counte&s;s of <HI>Salisbury</HI> with whom King <HI>Edward</HI> III. became greatly enamour'd, <HI>Froi&s;&s;art</HI> re|ports after this manner, <HI>That this King having relieved a Ca&s;tle of that Earl's in the North, wherein his Counte&s;s had been be&s;ieged by the</HI> Scots <HI>(the Earl him&s;elf being at that time Pri&s;oner in</HI> France;) <HI>upon &s;ight of her extraordinary Beauty he fell in love with her; but &s;he &s;o virtuou&s;ly demeaned her &s;elf, during his Abode there, that he declined further Solicita|tion.</HI> However, &s;ome time after, the King out of De|&s;ire to &s;ee her, proclaim'd &s;olemn Ju&s;ts in <HI>London,</HI> whi|ther this Counte&s;s and other Ladies being invited, came up. This Ca&s;tle it &s;eems was <HI>Wark</HI> upon <HI>Tweed</HI> in <HI>Nor|thumberland,</HI> which King <HI>Edward</HI> had formerly be&s;towed on her Husband, for his good Service pa&s;t, when he fir&s;t e&s;pou&s;ed her, being then but a Knight.</P>
<P>ALTHO' it &s;hould be admitted that this Counte&s;s of <HI>Salisbury</HI> was the King's Mi&s;tre&s;s, yet mu&s;t it be re|mark'd, That &s;he was Wife to <HI>William Mountague,</HI> Kt. created Earl of <HI>Salisbury, Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. Mother to <HI>William</HI> the before-mention'd &s;econd Earl, that her Chri&s;tian Name was <HI>Catherine,</HI> not <HI>Alice,</HI> as <HI>Froi&s;&s;art,</HI> not <HI>Joan,</HI> as others call her, Daughter to <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Gran&s;ton,</HI> and that &s;he expired 28 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. But that the whole may appear, what indeed it is, a meer Fable, we &s;hall in&s;ert the Judgment of Dr. <HI>Heylin,</HI> who took great Pains in this Particular. <HI>This,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I take to be a vain and idle Romance, derogatory both to the Founder and the Order fir&s;t publi&s;hed by</HI> Pol. Virgil, <HI>a Stranger to the Affairs of</HI> England, <HI>and by him taken upon no better ground than</HI> Fama Vulgi, <HI>the Tradition of the common People, too tri|fling a Foundation to &s;o great a Building.</HI></P>
<P><HI>OF the &s;ame Contexture with the former is another Tradition in</HI> Andrew du Che&s;ne, That the Queen departing from the King to her own Apartments, and he following &s;oon after, chanced to e&s;py a Blue Garter lying on the Ground (&s;up|po&s;ed to have &s;lipp'd from her Leg) whil&s;t &s;ome of his Atten|dants carele&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed by it, as di&s;daining to &s;toop at &s;uch a Trifle; but he knowing the Owner, commanded it to be gi|ven him; at the Receipt of which he &s;aid, You make but &s;mall account of this Garter; but within few Months, I'll cau&s;e the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of you all to reverence it alike. <HI>Some &s;uppo&s;e that the Motto was the Queen's An&s;wer, when the King asked</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="130">
<HI>her,</HI> What Men would conjecture of her, upon her lo&s;ing her Garter in &s;uch a manner?</P>
<P>BOTH Relations are far di&s;tant from Fact; never|thele&s;s it has thus far'd with other Orders of Sove|reign Foundation, and an amorous, in&s;tead of an ho|nourable Account, has been fal&s;ly render'd of their In&s;titution; as for In&s;tance, <HI>The Order of the</HI> Annun|ciade, and that of <HI>The Golden Fleece.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a third Opinion grounded on a Relation made of King <HI>Rich.</HI> I. who, whil&s;t his Forces were employ'd again&s;t <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Acon,</HI> and extremely tir'd and harra&s;s'd with the Siege, he, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Mediation of St. <HI>George</HI> (as imagin'd) was in&s;pir'd with fre&s;h Courage, and bethought him&s;elf of a new Device, which was to tie about the Legs of a Number of Knights, a Leathern Thong Garter, for &s;uch had he then at hand, whereby they being emulated to future Glory, with A&s;&s;urance of Reward if they prov'd victo|rious, they might be excited to behave them&s;elves in|trepidly and well, much after the Examples of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> among whom were di&s;tributed various Crowns for &s;everal Cau&s;es, to adorn the Soldiers: But if King <HI>Richard</HI> I. did make u&s;e of this Device in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> as a Signal or Mark of Di&s;tinction of a Party, upon &s;ome warlike Exploit, yet that he took Occa&s;ion to create a di&s;tinct Order of Knighthood thereupon, there is not &s;ufficient warrant to believe; (for it is only put down in the Preface of the <HI>Black Book,</HI> but not in any Part of the Annals of the Order; nor can it plead higher Antiquity than the Reign of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. when written.) All the Advantage that can be made of it, is, to heighten the Reputation of that Saint among the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by which Means the Garter came to be dedicated to him, and not that it contributed to its In&s;titution.</P>

<P>&sect; 2. THE true Motive was therefore, neither the Ladies Garter, or King <HI>Richard</HI>'s Leathern Thong, that it owes it Original to: But King <HI>Edward,</HI> being a Per&s;on of con&s;ummate Vertue, gave him&s;elf up to military Affairs; and being engag'd in War for reco|vering his Right to <HI>France,</HI> made u&s;e of the be&s;t Martiali&s;ts

And the&s;e Letters of Safe-Conduct continu'd in force until the <HI>Octaves</HI> of the Purification of our ble&s;&s;ed Virgin en&s;uing, being the 18th Year of his Reign. At the Time appointed, he provided a great Supper to begin the Solemnity, and then ordain'd this Fe&s;tival to be annually at <HI>Whit|&s;ontide;</HI> and immediately after the&s;e fir&s;t Exerci&s;es were over, for a future and better Accommodation, he im|pre&s;s'd Workmen and Carriages for erecting a particu|lar Building in the Ca&s;tle, and therein plac'd a Table of Two Hundred Foot Diameter, where the Knights &s;hould have their Entertainment of Diet, at his Ex|pence of 100 <HI>l. per</HI> Week; to which Building he gave the Name of <HI>The Round Table.</HI> And as at the&s;e great Conventions the Days were &s;pent in all Kinds of no|ble Feats of Arms, Ju&s;ts and Turnaments, &s;o were a great Part of the Nights con&s;um'd in publick Balls and dancing with the Ladies that attended the Queen thither; and perhaps it was hence conjectur'd, that at &s;ome of the&s;e Balls the Queen's Garter, or the Garter of <HI>Catherine,</HI> Counte&s;s of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> might &s;lip off, and the King's taking it up occa&s;ion Smiles in the By|&s;tanders; and afterwards, when the King had modell'd his intended Order, a Garter offering it &s;elf for its chief En&s;ign, might add to the Conjecture; but that it was the principal Cau&s;e, is a groundle&s;s Imagination. And tho' King <HI>Edward</HI> advanc'd the Honour of the Garter, as to denominate the Order, yet was it not to enhance Reputation to, or perpetuate an effeminate Occa&s;ion, but to adorn Martial Prowe&s;s, with Ho|nours, Rewards and Splendor; to increa&s;e Vertue and Valour in the Hearts of his Nobility, that &s;o true Worth, after long and hazardous Exploits, &s;hould not

enviou&s;ly be depriv'd of that Glory which it hath in|trin&s;ically de&s;erv'd, and that active and hardy Youths might not want a Spur in their Progre&s;&s;ion in the Paths of Vertue, which is to be e&s;teem'd glorious and eternal.</P>
<P>IT is further ob&s;ervable, that the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Phi|lip de Valoys,</HI> in Emulation of this Seminary at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> &s;et up a <HI>Round Table</HI> at his Court, and invited Knights and valiant Men of Arms out of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Almaine</HI> thi|ther, left they &s;hould repair to our King <HI>Edward</HI> III. which meeting with Succe&s;s, prov'd a Countermine to his main De&s;ign; who perceiving that his Ho&s;pitality towards &s;trange Knights, upon Account of reviving King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s <HI>Round Table</HI> was too general, nor did &s;uf|ficiently ingratiate them to his Per&s;on, but being un|con&s;train'd and at Liberty, did after their Departure take what Side they pleas'd in the en&s;uing Wars, he at length re&s;olv'd upon a Projection more particu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ar and &s;elect, and &s;uch as might oblige tho&s;e whom he thought fit to make his A&s;&s;ociates, in a la&s;ting Bond of Friend&s;hip and Honour: And having i&s;&s;u'd forth his own Garter for the Signal of a Battle, that was crown'd with Succe&s;s, (which is conceiv'd to be the Battle of <HI>Cre&s;&s;y,</HI> fought about Three Years after his erecting the <HI>Round Table;)</HI> upon &s;o remarkable a Victory, he thence took Occa&s;ion to in&s;titute this Order, and gave the Garter Preheminence among the En&s;igns of it, whence that &s;elect Number, whom he incorporated into a Fra|ternity, are &s;tyl'd <HI>Equites Aureae Peri&s;celidis,</HI> and vulgarly <HI>Knights of the Garter.</HI> By this Symbol he de&s;ign'd to bind the Knights and Fellows of it mutually unto one anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, and all of them joyntly to him&s;elf, as Sove|reign of the Order; nor was his Expectation fru&s;tra|ted, for it did not &s;erve only as a vehement Spur and Incentive to Honour and martial Vertue, but al&s;o as a golden Bond of Unity and internal Society; and for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">his Con&s;ideration <HI>Cambden</HI> aptly calls it a Badge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nity and Concord.</P>
<P>BY the Symbols of this Garter the Knights are re|minded, with all Religiou&s;ne&s;s, Sincerity, Friendline&s;s, Faithfulne&s;s and Dexterity, not to leave the Pur&s;uit of what&s;oever they take in hand, nor to enterprize any
<PB N="125" REF="133">
Thing contrary to the Statutes of the Order; neither to fru&s;trate the Rights of Peace and Friend&s;hip, nor vilify the Law of Arms, or proceed in any Thing far|ther than Faith and Compact, or the Bond of Friend|&s;hip will admit. Moreover, in the binding of the Leg with this enobled En&s;ign, there was given this Caveat and Exhortation, that the Knights &s;hould not pu&s;illa|nimou&s;ly (by running away from Battle) betray the Valour and Renown which is ingrafted in Con&s;tancy and Magnanimity. Nay, &s;o exactly did the Founder contrive the whole Habit into the Signification of the Garter, that he ordain'd his and the Knights-Compa|nions Robes and Ornaments to be all alike, both for Materials and Fa&s;hion, intimating thereby, That they ought to con&s;erve brotherly Affection among them|&s;elves. The great Collar of the Order was made of equal Weight, and like Number of Knots and Links, in Token of the like Bond of Faith, Peace and Amity inviolably to be ob&s;erv'd and retain'd among&s;t them: In fine, all Things were &s;o de&s;ign'd, that every one might plainly perceive how much the&s;e Things tended to the Maintenance of Amity and Concord.</P>
<P>IN further reference to the e&s;tabli&s;hing this Order, the afore&s;aid King calling together the Earls, Barons, and principal Knights of his Kingdom, <HI>Freely,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Froi&s;&s;art, and obligingly declar'd his Mind to them concerning this Affair:</HI> To which <HI>all of them being well inclin'd, en|tertain'd the Motion with equal Joy and Applau&s;e, deeming it would prove a very great Advancement to Piety, Nobility and Vertue, and likewi&s;e an excellent Expedient for the uni|ting not only his Subjects one with another, but all Foreigners conjunctively with them, in the Bonds of Amity and Peace.</HI> And 'tis very improbable the prudent Founder &s;hould &s;ummon his Nobles to con&s;ult about the Grandeur of an Order, that had taken its Ri&s;e from &s;o &s;light an Occa&s;ion as the dropping of a Garter from a Lady's Leg. Now, to draw the Tye of Friend&s;hip more clo&s;e, the King cau&s;ed tho&s;e who were (or &s;hould be) of the Order, to be call'd <HI>Fellows, A&s;&s;ociates, Colleagues, Brethren,</HI> and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and the Order it &s;elf a <HI>Society, Fellow&s;hip, College of Knights,</HI> and <HI>Knight-Companion&s;hip;</HI> and their Habits to be all alike, to repre&s;ent how they

ought to be united in all Chances and various Turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Fortune; Co-partners both in Peace and War, a&s;&s;i|&s;tant to one another in all &s;erious and dangerous Ex|ploits; and thro' the whole Cour&s;e of their Lives to &s;hew Fidelity and Friendline&s;s one towards another. There are other Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;ign'd, much to the &s;ame Effect, That the Order was in&s;tituted <HI>to fortifie the Con|fidence of the King, the Kingdom and Martial Vertue;</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>to &s;trengthen the Faith of the Subjects towards them, and for their greater Security,</HI> and <HI>becau&s;e the Garter carries with it a Bond or Tye of Fellow&s;hip, and is a Symbol of Amity between Princes, being Companions of the &s;ame Order.</HI></P>
<P>IN the la&s;t Place, if we look upon the Statutes of its In&s;titution, we &s;hall find the Injunctions wholly Mili|tary, and &s;o are the Words of Admonition pronounc'd at the putting on the En&s;igns of the Order: And the Ground of the In&s;titution (in the Preamble to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's <HI>Exemplar)</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>for the Honour of God and Exaltation of the Catholick Faith, joyn'd both with Piety and Charity, in e&s;tabli&s;hing a College of religious Men to pray for the Pro&s;perity of the Sovereign of the Order and the Knights-Companions, and to perform other holy Duties;</HI> as al&s;o <HI>or|daining a Maintenance for a Company of Alms-Knights, who have not otherwi&s;e wherewith to &s;upport them&s;elves;</HI> but not one Word relating to the Engagement on behalf of the feminine Sex.</P>
<P>AND whereas King <HI>Edw.</HI> III. had laid Claim by his Title to the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> and in Right thereof a&s;&s;um'd its Arms, he from the Colour of them, 'tis &s;aid, caus'd the Garter to be made Blue, and the Circum|&s;cription Gold: And it may, without &s;training, be in|ferr'd from the Motto, <HI>Honi &s;oit qui mal y pen&s;e,</HI> that he retorted Shame and Defiance upon him that &s;hould dare to think ami&s;s of &s;o ju&s;t an Enterprize, as he had undertaken for recovering of his lawful Right to that Crown; and that the Magnanimity and Bravery of tho&s;e Knights, whom he had elected into this Or|der, was &s;uch as would impower and enable them to maintain the Quarrel again&s;t all who thought ill of it. Con&s;onant to this is the Conjecture of <HI>Harpsfield,</HI> that this Apophthegm was de&s;ign'd to put the Knights-Companions

<P>&sect; 3. THERE have been &s;everal Endeavours &s;ince the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. for reforming the Statutes.

<P>THE fir&s;t, in Order of time, is an old Paper Book written in <HI>French,</HI> call'd <HI>Regi&s;trum Chartaceum,</HI> hitherto fortunately pre&s;erv'd in the Paper Office at <HI>White-hall,</HI> which probably was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gun by <HI>John Coningham;</HI> for we find him, 1414.

Hand; and that he &s;hortly after died in 1445. Hence|forward the&s;e Annals are entred with promi&s;cuous Hands, which may be pre&s;umed the proper Hand-Writings of the Regi&s;ters of this Noble Order, as they &s;ucceeded each other in the Office.</P>
<P>AFTER we find <HI>Richard Sidnor</HI> mention'd in the Regi&s;ter <HI>Anno</HI> 16 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. (who &s;ub&s;cribed his Name at the foot of every Leaf) the Annals were pen'd in one Hand until <HI>Anno</HI> 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. that <HI>Robert A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">drydge,</HI> D.

<P>BESIDES this there is another Book that goes by the Name of the <HI>Black Book,</HI> wherein the Annals of the Order are tran&s;cribed in <HI>Latin,</HI> concerning which there pa&s;s'd a Decree, <HI>Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. that it &s;hould be fairly copy'd out, and afterwards that the Sovereign &s;hould be put in Remembrance of it; but neither of the&s;e De|crees was put in execution, nor was this confirm'd till towards the End of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. This Book differs very little from the <HI>Regi&s;trum Chartaceum,</HI> for therein is nothing enrolled relating to the Order (except one of the Exemplars of the Founders Statutes, and a Catalogue of the fir&s;t Twenty-five Knights-Companions) before the 4th Year of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. the Annals of the Order, until that time, be|ing entirely lo&s;t.

<P>AS to the general Directions for Compiling the&s;e Books, and the Particulars they are to con&s;i&s;t of, we are inform'd from the &s;aid Statutes and Con&s;titutions; for be&s;ides the Entry of all the Scrutinies taken in Chapter and Elections made thereupon, it is his Office to record the Penalties inflicted on Knights-Compa|nions, and the Reconciliation of all Delinquents with other Acts, and their Cau&s;es appertaining to the Order, all which are decreed to be recited before the Sove|reign and Knights-Companions at the Beginning of the Chapter yearly, if Occa&s;ion be, to correct and reduce into Method.

<P>AND becau&s;e the time perfix'd for Rehear&s;al of the&s;e Particulars in Chapter, had in &s;ucceeding Years been imploy'd in other Affairs.

<P>BESIDES the abovemention'd Particulars, there were Materials of another Nature, decreed to be collected by the Chancellor of the Order and Garter King of Arms, to be dige&s;ted fir&s;t, and after entred by the Re|gi&s;ter; for whereas one part of the Chancellor's Duty was to make a Narration every Year in Chapter, at the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George,</HI> of the illu&s;trious Exploits of the Knights-Companions, as well as the Actions that tend to eclip&s;e their Glory; &s;o the Regi&s;ter was to note the&s;e, and record them from a perpetual Aera or Memorial of their Honour or Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>AND it is part of Garter's Duty diligently to enquire after the Valiant, Fortunate, and Renown'd Acts, both of the Sovereign and the re&s;t of the Knights-Compani|ons, and relate them with all Exactne&s;s to the Regi&s;ter, for his Engro&s;&s;ing: But how &s;paringly the&s;e are put in execution, the Annals them&s;elves bear witne&s;s.

<P>For the Safety and Pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Annals,</HI> the Knights-Commi&s;&s;ioners determined the 22d of <HI>May, An. Jac.</HI> I. 20.

<P>THE Habit and En&s;igns of this mo&s;t Noble Order are mo&s;t eminently di&s;tingui&s;hable and magnifi|cent, and con&s;i&s;t of the&s;e Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> Garter, Mantle, Surcoat, Hood, George, and Collar; for as the <HI>Romans</HI> were very exact and particular in a&s;&s;igning each Degree a peculiar Habit and Ve&s;ture, by which the Qua|lity and Rank of their Citizens might be di&s;cernable, the Di&s;tinction of Apparel was afterwards taken up by divers other Nations, whence every Military, as well as Eccle|&s;ia&s;tick Order of Knighthood, did appropriate to it &s;elf a peculiar Dre&s;s, En&s;ign, or Badge, as a Mark of Di&s;tin|ction one from another, to &s;et off the Lu&s;tre and Honour of their &s;everal Societies.</P>
<P>The four fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> the Garter, Mantle, Surcoar, and Hood, were a&s;&s;igned the Knights Companions, by the Founder, and the George and Collar by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and all the&s;e together are called the whole Habit or En|&s;igns of the Order, which we &s;hall treat of &s;uccinctly, beginning with the Garter.</P>
<P>The Royal Garter challengeth the Preheminence, for from it this famous Order receiv'd its Denomination: It is the fir&s;t part of the Habit pre&s;ented to Foreign Princes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Ab&s;ent Knights, and that wherewith they, and all other elect Knights, are fir&s;t adorn'd; and of &s;o great Honour and Grandeur, that by the bare Inve&s;titure with this Noble En&s;ign, the Knights are e&s;teem'd Companions of the greate&s;t Military Order in the World.</P>

the Leg; but there's no doubt but it was wrought with rich Embroidery, and the Motto rais'd with Gold, Pearl, and &s;undry Sorts of Silk, as may be gue&s;s'd from the Garters anciently plac'd on the left &s;ide of the Knights-Companions Mantles, and tho&s;e other little embroider'd Garters, wherewith their Surcoats and Hoods were heretofore embelli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>BUT of tho&s;e wrought in the la&s;t Age, we have more particular Satisfaction; for we find the Garter &s;ent to <HI>Emanuel</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy, Anno</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> was &s;et with Letters of Gold&s;mith's Work, the Buckle and Pendant of the &s;ame, and on the Pendant a Ruby, and a Pearl hanging at the End. The Garter made for <HI>Francis</HI> II. <HI>Anno</HI> 6 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was richly wrought with Letters of Gold, &s;et off and garni&s;h'd with Stones, the Buckle and Pendant weighing Three Ounces and an half-quarter, was richly &s;et with Rubies and Dia|monds. The <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. had a Garter of Purple Velvet embroider'd with Letters of Gold, and deck'd out with Diamonds and Rubies. And the Gar|ter of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> IV. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> was embroider'd with Gold and Pearls: But that Garter &s;ent to <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> outvied all others conferr'd by former Sovereigns, each Letter of the Motto being compos'd of &s;mall Diamonds; and for every Stop, a Diamond within a Range of Diamonds, above and be|low, on the &s;ides of the Garter, and be&s;ides other Dia|monds on the Buckle, and about the &s;ame, to the Num|ber in all of 411.</P>
<P>THE Garter which King <HI>Charles</HI> I. wore upon his Leg at the Time of his Martyrdom, had the Letters of the Motto compos'd likewi&s;e of Diamonds, which amount|ed to the Number of 412. It came to the Hands of Captain <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> (one of the U&s;urper's Captains) from whom the Tru&s;tees, for Sale of the King's Goods, re|ceiv'd it, and &s;old it to <HI>Ireton,</HI> &s;ometimes Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> for 205 <HI>l.</HI> But after the Re&s;toration, the King's Attorney-General proceeding upon an Action of <HI>Trover</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> Verdict was given for the King again&s;t him for 205 <HI>l.</HI> and 10 <HI>l.</HI> co&s;ts of Suits, in <HI>Trinity</HI> Term, 16 <HI>Car.</HI> II.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="167">
THE Motto of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was &s;et with Dia|monds upon Blue Velvet, and the Borders wrought with fine Gold Wire; the Diamonds which framed the Letters of the Motto, were Ro&s;e Diamonds, much of a Size or Proportion; but tho&s;e which framed the Stops, Table-Diamonds; the Total which &s;et each Let|ter, compos'd the Stops, Ilot Holes, and adorn'd the Buckle; the Table was Two Hundred and Fifty; the Hinge of the Buckle was pure Gold, and on it the So|vereign's Picture to the Brea&s;t, curiou&s;ly cut in Flat|&s;titch, crown'd with a Laurel and the military Garb of the fir&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors; the Table or Pendant was Gold, and on the back-&s;ide thereof engrav'd St. <HI>George</HI> on Hor&s;e-back encountring the Dragon.</P>
<P>THIS noble En&s;ign, the Garter, was at the Erection of the Order appointed to be wore on the left Leg, a little beneath the Knee, which U&s;age &s;till pre&s;ides: And the placing it thus, on the Sepulchral Portraictures of Knights-Companions, was an early Cu&s;tom; for on the Alaba&s;ter Monument of Sir <HI>William Fitz-warin,</HI> who was interr'd in the North-&s;ide of the Chancel at <HI>Wan|tage</HI> in <HI>Com. Berks,</HI> 35 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. he lies there with his Surcoat of Arms upon his Brea&s;t, and the Repre&s;enta|tion of a Garter (but without Motto) carv'd upon his left Leg. In the &s;ame Po&s;ture lies Sir <HI>Richard Pem|bridge,</HI> elected a Knight-Companion, <HI>temp. Edw.</HI> III. and is portraicted on his Monument in the South-&s;ide of the Cathedral of <HI>Hereford,</HI> below the Pulpit, and en|compa&s;s'd with a Rail of Iron-Spikes.</P>
<P>THE next Monument whereon the Garter was de|picted, was that erected for Sir <HI>Simon Burley,</HI> (beheaded <HI>A. D.</HI> 1388.) and rear'd in the North-Wall near the Choir of St. <HI>Paul's, London.</HI> Thence-forward the Pra|ctice became more frequent, and then the Motto began to be cut thereon; in&s;omuch that it is now the con|&s;tant and ju&s;t Practice to do it, when&s;oever the Knights-Companions are exhibited in Effigies.</P>
<P>AND altho' this En&s;ign was fir&s;t de&s;ign'd in Orna|ment to the left Leg, yet it was not confin'd &s;o &s;olely thereto, but was anciently us'd to incircle the E&s;cut|cheon of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Arms, worn by the Sovereign and Knights-Companions on their Mantles, who within a

<P>THE fir&s;t Example that occurs, is the before-menti|on'd of Sir <HI>Francis Burley,</HI> where, on the Front, to|wards the Head, is his own Arms empaling his fir&s;t Wife's, &s;et within a Garter, (wanting the Impre&s;s;) but another having the &s;ame Empalement, (plac'd be|low the Feet) is &s;urrounded with a Collar of SS. of the &s;ame Form with that about his Neck.</P>
<P>THE Monument al&s;o of <HI>Joan,</HI> Wife of <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> Earl of <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> on the South-&s;ide of the Choir, in the Cathedral of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> bears the Arms of <HI>Nevil,</HI> empaling tho&s;e of <HI>Joan,</HI> his Wife, (who dy'd <HI>A. D.</HI> 1410.) Incircled within a Garter, and fix'd on this Lady's Monument, Daughter to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gount,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> is there &s;uch a Collar of SS. placed about a Square; but the Paint being faded, was render'd un|intelligible.</P>
<P>ANOTHER antique In&s;tance is that E&s;cutcheon, <HI>Sable, Three O&s;trich Feathers Argent,</HI> &s;urrounded with the Gar|ter, affix'd in the Gla&s;s-Windows of <HI>Greenwich</HI>-Church in <HI>Kent,</HI> by <HI>Humfrey,</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and &s;upported with a Greyhound and an Antelope. It is reported, the&s;e Three Feathers were the En&s;ign of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. which were conferr'd by <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> his Father, who bore them for his Device, and placed in a <HI>Field Sable,</HI> as here, but the Pens were powder'd with <HI>Ermin,</HI> for a difference from the Black Prince's Feather, which were <HI>Argent,</HI> as the King's Pen was <HI>Or,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>'s Compony <HI>Argent</HI> and <HI>Azure.</HI></P>

<P>WHAT Duration the wearing Cloth had, is not di|rectly &s;et down, but the fir&s;t time we di&s;cover their Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">les to be of Velvet, is about the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n.</HI> VI. which Sort of Silk hath thence remained until this Day. About this Period, 'tis ob|&s;erved, that the Mantles of Foreign Princes were made here of Velvet, for &s;o was that tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;mitted to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> elected <HI>Anno</HI> 1346. Concerning the Man|tles of the Knights-Companions, there is no doubt but they were of the &s;ame Materials with tho&s;e made for the Sovereign, <HI>viz.</HI> at fir&s;t of fine Woollen Cloth, and when the Sovereign exchanged it for Velvet, they followed his Example; but we cannot meet with equal Satisfaction in this Point, becau&s;e the Knights-Compa|nions provided this Robe at their own Expence; and
<PB N="160" REF="173">
their private Accounts herein pa&s;&s;ing thro' &s;o many Con|tingences, were of no great Durability. But their Surcoats were of the Sovereigns Donation, and con&s;e|quently the Particulars of them remain on Record in the Rolls and Accounts of the great Wardrobe.</P>
<P>THE Colour of the&s;e Mantles is appointed by the Statutes to be Blue, and of this Colour was the Found|ers; by which, as by the Ground-work of the Royal Garter, it is not improbable he alluded to the Colour of the Field in the <HI>French</HI> Arms, which a few Years be|fore he began to Quarter with tho&s;e of <HI>England.</HI> But the Colour of the Surcoat was changed every Year, as will appear by and by.

<P>BUT in King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIIIth's Statutes there's no menti|on at all of the Colour of this upper Robe, &s;ave only of the <HI>Mantle,</HI> which the Proxy of a Foreign Prince was enjoined to bring with him when he came to a&s;&s;ume the Stall of his Principal; which, tho' it does not come di|rectly up to the Poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, yet it is to be ob&s;erved to be of blue Velvet.

<P>WITHIN this Garter was the Arms of St. <HI>George, viz.</HI> Argent a <HI>Cro&s;s Gules,</HI> and was heretofore wrought in Sat|tin, with Gold, Silver and Silk; but in de&s;cending Times greater Expence and Magnificence became the Practice of the Order, for it was embordered upon Velvet with Damask, Gold, and &s;undry Sorts of Purls, Plates, <HI>Venice</HI> Twi&s;ts and Silks, and the Letters of the Motto and Borders of the Garter compo&s;ed of fair Oriental Pearl.

The Third En&s;ign of the Order is the <HI>Surcoat</HI> or <HI>Kirtle,</HI> which altho' we find no Place for it in the Founder's Statutes, is neverthele&s;s as ancient as the Man|tle or upper Robe, that is only taken Notice of there, for &s;uch a Ve&s;ture King <HI>Edward</HI> III. then made, to|gether with his Mantle and a Hood to celebrate the fir&s;t Fea&s;t of the Order in.</P>
<P>ITS Original it owes to the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> a|mong&s;t whom this Garment had its determinated <HI>Tu|nica,</HI> and was worn next under the <HI>Toga,</HI> but among&s;t them was both narrower and &s;horter; it was girt clo&s;e to the Body with a Girdle, and &s;o fitted, that the Hem of it reached a little below the Knee, or to the middle of the Ham. It was the proper Mode of the <HI>Roman</HI> Citi|zens, and by its trimming were the three Degrees among them known; for the Senators Tunicks were embroi|dered or purfled over with broad purple Studs, the Knights with narrow ones, and the Plebeians plain.</P>

Princes, as appears by the Books of Warrants in the great Wardrobe, but the re&s;t are Terms of a later Date: As the fir&s;t Mantles, &s;o the fir&s;t Surcoats were compo&s;ed of Woollen Cloth, and tho' the Cloth of the Mantles was in &s;ome &s;pace after changed for Velvet, yet the Surcoats continued afterwards to be of Cloth, at lea&s;t till after the Office of Chancellor of the Garter was erected by King <HI>Edward</HI> IV. as is manife&s;t by the Precedent of this Livery in the Sovereigns great Ward|robe; but in proce&s;s of Time they became Velvet, which &s;ort of Silk is yet retained.</P>
<P>THE Colour of this Ve&s;ture was anciently changed every Year, commonly into Blue, Scarlet, Sanguine in Grain, or White.

The Length of King <HI>Charles</HI> II's Surcoat was one Yard and an half, and of the Sleeve one Yard wanting a Nail.</P>
<P>THE Ornamental Trimmings of the&s;e Garments are next worthy of Note, e&s;pecially at the Time of In&s;ti|tuting this Order, for they were then, and a long time after, powdered all over with little Garters, embroi|dered with Silk and Gold-Plate, in each of which was neatly wrought the Motto, <HI>Honi &s;oit,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>ABOUT the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. the Sovereigns Number of Garters did not much exceed tho&s;e which the Founder allow'd to him&s;elf at the In&s;titution; for the Surcoat and Hood of the &s;aid King con&s;i&s;ted of 173; and the King of <HI>Portugal, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. 120 Garters. But this Drapery of their Robes became at length quite ob&s;olete, perhaps when Cloth was altered to Velvet, and the plain Surcoat hath to this Day continued in U&s;e.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e Surcoats remained of Cloth, they were lined with Bellies of pure Minever Fur, only the Sovereigns was purfled with Ermin; and of the&s;e, it &s;eems, a like Proportion was at fir&s;t &s;tated to all the Knights-Companions, <HI>viz.</HI> 200 Bellies. Yet in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> II. &s;ome Difference began in the Allowance to the Knights-Companions, for a Baron, and all Degrees upward had 200 Bellies; but under a Ba|ron 120 only. However, <HI>Anno</HI> 1. <HI>Henry</HI> V. the Barons were tantamount to the Knights-Batchelors, for all De|grees above a Baron were allow'd, a Fur of 200 Bellies. But the Barons and Knights-Batchelors Furs were on|ly 120 Bellies.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS, by the Precedent of the Garter, there was another Proportion limited, the Prince, a Duke, a Marquis, an Earl, had each of them Five Timber of pure Minever allowed to a Surcoat; but the Vi&s;count, Baron, Baronet and Batchelor-Knights but Three Timber apiece. In time the&s;e Furs were di&s;u&s;ed, and the Surcoats came to be lined with white Sarcenet, to which, <HI>temp. Eliz.</HI> white Taffaty &s;ucc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eded, and that &s;till continues.</P>
<P>WHAT became of the old Surcoats, &s;ince the Knights-Companions had new ones every Year, the Black Book of the Order informs us, That on the Eve of the Fea&s;t
<PB N="168" REF="181">
of St. <HI>George,</HI> the Knights wore to Ve&s;pers, the Sove|reigns Livery or Surcoats, u&s;ed by them the preceding Year, which after that Night they threw off, (for the new Surcoats were worn on the Fea&s;t-Day); but the En&s;igns and Ornaments of this Kind were di&s;po&s;ed of to the U&s;e of the Colledge.</P>
<P>THE Hood and Cap comes in the next Place to be &s;poken of, which Hood in King, <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statu|tes, and the Black Book of the Order is called <HI>Hu|merale;</HI> but in the Rolls of the Great Wardrobe, <HI>Capu|cium.</HI> In the <HI>French</HI> it is <HI>Chaperon,</HI> a Word u&s;ed in the Statute, <HI>Anno</HI> 1. <HI>Richard</HI> II. <HI>C.</HI> 7. and al&s;o retained in the Old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Copy of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes made of his Reign, and annexed to this Treati&s;e. They were anciently wore for Defence of the Head again&s;t the In|clemencies of Weather, but of later Times Caps and Hats have &s;upplied their place. How they &s;at upon the Head, may be ob&s;erved in the Portraitures of the fir&s;t Founders; as al&s;o with &s;ome Variety of Fa&s;hion in &s;uc|ceeding Ages: Yet is not the Hood quite thrown by, &s;ince 'tis &s;till kept reclining upon the Back, almo&s;t like a Pilgrim's Hat.</P>
<P>THIS Hood was ordained, and is yet retained as part of the Habit of this mo&s;t Noble Order. And tho' neither it nor the Surcoat is mentioned in the Statutes of In&s;titution, or in either its Exemplars, nor doth King <HI>Henry</HI> V. lay any Stre&s;s upon it, yet it is of equal Antiquity with the re&s;t, as appears from the Rolls of the great Wardrobe, and <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes have made re|markable Ob&s;ervation of it, for the Mantle, Surcoat, Hood, and Collar are called the Habit of the Order: And in the Black Book, <HI>Anno</HI> 22. <HI>Henry</HI> VII. at the Inve&s;titure of <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> the Mantle, Kirtle, Hood and Collar are expre&s;ly called <HI>Whole Habit.</HI></P>
<P>IT was heretofore, and now is generally made of the &s;ame Materials as the Surcoat, and was anciently trim|med and &s;et off with a &s;mall Proportion of Garters lined with Cloth of a different Colour, and &s;uch as would be&s;t &s;trike the Sight; but now with Taffaty, as is the Lining of the Surcoat.</P>
<P>AS to the Cap, which was in&s;tituted to &s;ucceed the Hood; it hath been, and yet is, fa&s;hioned of black
<PB N="169" REF="182">
Velvet lin'd with Taffaty; but the Figure hath &s;everal Times varied; for <HI>Temp. Henry</HI> VIII. it was flat, in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign it was a little rai&s;ed in the Head; but in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time they were much more high-crown'd. This Cap hath been u&s;ually adorn'd with Plumes of White Feathers, and Spriggs, and bound a|bout with a Band &s;et thick with Diamonds; &s;o was the Cap for the In&s;tallation of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and &s;ometimes the Brims have been tack'd up with a large and co&s;tly Jewel.</P>
<P>THIS Cu&s;tom of wearing Caps and Feathers at the Grand Solemnities of the Order, had, for &s;ome Time, about the Beginning of King <HI>James</HI> I. Reign, been omitted, and thereupon, in a Chapter held the 13th of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 10. <HI>Jac.</HI> I. this commendable Cu&s;tom was re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>To the&s;e may be added the Cro&s;s of the Order en|compa&s;s'd with a Garter, which by the Sovereign was ordain'd the 27th of <HI>April,</HI> 2 <HI>Car.</HI> I. to be worn upon the Left Side of the Cloaks, Coats, and riding Ca&s;&s;ocks of the Sovereigns and Knights-Companions, of the Prelate and Chancellor at all Times, when they were not adorn'd with their Robes, and in all Places and A&s;&s;emblies (but not embelli&s;h'd with Pearls and Stones) that the wearing thereof might be a &s;ufficient Indication to the World, of that Height of Honour they arriv'd to from the &s;aid mo&s;t Noble Order, in&s;tituted for Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Merit and Worth.</P>
<P>AND it was not long after e'er the Glory or Star, as it was u&s;ually call'd, having certain Beams of Silver, that &s;hot out in Form of a Cro&s;s, was introduc'd and annex'd to it, in Imitation (as thought) of the <HI>French,</HI> who after the &s;ame manner wore the chief En&s;ign of the Order of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> being the Repre&s;entation of a Dove irradiated with &s;uch like Beams.</P>
<P>AND whereas &s;ome Painters affirm the Symbol of the Holy Gho&s;t to be thus adorn'd congruous enough, yet cen&s;ure it improper for a Garter, let them con&s;ider that King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. erected his White Ro&s;e with the like Glory, whereof both the Stone Work and Wood Work of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel in <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> manife&s;tly illu&s;trate, who&s;e Antiquity makes a Precedent for it long before

<P>&sect; 5. HAVING fini&s;h'd our Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Robes of the Order, we &s;hall &s;peak of the robes and Hoods a&s;&s;ign'd to the Queen, Knights-Companions Wives, and other great Ladies, by the Donation of the Sovereigns, &s;et off and embelli&s;hed with Minute Gar|ters, and lin'd with Rich Furs, which Robes they were adorn'd with during the Solemnity of the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George,</HI> a Cu&s;tom almo&s;t as ancient as its In&s;titution. The fir&s;t Mention we find recorded of the Feminine Habit occurs, <HI>Anno</HI> 7. <HI>R.</HI> II. when the Queen, the Sovereign's Mother, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> the Counte&s;&s;es of <HI>Cambridge, Buckingham, Pembroke, Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Salisbury,</HI> the Ladies <HI>Philippa</HI> and <HI>Catherine,</HI> Daughters to the Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Mohun</HI> had &s;uch kind of Robes and Hoods provided for them. They were made of Cloth, Violet in Grain, like as the Sovereign and Knights-Companions that Year, the Robes lin'd with Fur, but the Hoods with Scarlet, and both embroidered over with little Garters, and the Proportion of Cloth, Furs, and Garters, were &s;tated according to their &s;everal Ranks and Degrees; for the Queen had Eight Ells, and Half an Ell of
<PB N="171" REF="184">
Scarlet for the Lining of her Hood. The Sovereign's Mother had allow'd her one whole Piece, and a double Proportion of Scarlet; but from the large Quantity it is conceiv'd &s;he had Two Robes and Hoods made at this time: Be&s;ides, the particular Number are but Eleven Per&s;ons, and cannot el&s;e reach the Total of the Robes that were made up and expre&s;ly &s;et down to be Twelve. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> had the Allowance of Half a Piece, and Half an Ell of Scarlet; the Counte&s;s of <HI>Cambridge</HI> Seven Ells of Cloth and Half an Ell of Scarlet, and the re&s;t of the Ladies the &s;ame Proportion of Cloth with the Knights-Companions, <HI>i. e.</HI> each Five Ells a-piece, and Half an Ell of Scarlet. According to their Cloth was al&s;o their Proportion of Minever; the Queen's Allowance was Two Furs, each containing Three Hundred Bellies of pure Minever; the Sove|reign's Mother had twice that Proportion, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and Counte&s;s of <HI>Cambridge</HI> had the &s;ame Allowance as the Queen; but all the re&s;t of the Ladies had only one Fur of Two Hundred Bellies. Be&s;ides the embroidered Garters to deck out the Twenty-four Surcoats of the Sovereign and Knights-Companions, and the Twelve Robes for the Queen, and other Ladies, amounted to the Number of 2900.</P>
<P>AGAINST the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George, Anno.</HI> II. <HI>R.</HI> II. there were prepared Fifteen Robes and Hoods for the Queen and other Ladies, of the &s;ame Livery and &s;uit with the Sovereign and Knights-Companions, <HI>viz.</HI> White long Cloth, and Blue Cloth for the Lining of their Hoods, bearing the &s;ame Proportion in all Things as the former, <HI>Anno</HI> 13. <HI>Rich.</HI> II. the Ladies Robes and Hoods were Sanguine Cloth, and the Lining of their Hoods Cloth in Grain. And in the 19th <HI>Rich.</HI> II. they were Blue Cloth, and long Cloth in Grain for Lining their Hoods. In both the&s;e Years we find the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Aquitaine</HI> had double the Proportion of Cloth allow'd her (as had al&s;o the Dutche&s;s of <HI>York) viz.</HI> Fourteen Ells, (the Queen having then but the former Allowance of Eight Ells) and yet her Proportion of Lining, both for the Robe and Hood, was no more than allow'd the Queen.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="185">
BUT <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Henry</HI> V. the &s;ame Quantities of Cloth, Minevers, and Garters, were the &s;ame to Ladies of all Degrees, and that was to each Five Ells of White Woollen Cloth, only the Queen-Mother had Eight Ells of White Cloth and Eight Ells of Black Cloth, a Fee containing Two Hundred Bellies of Minever, and an Hundred embroidered Garters, and 12 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. the Ma&s;ter of the great Wardrobe was commanded to make ready the like Livery, both for Colour of Cloth, number of Ells, Bellies of Minever, and Garters, for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> again&s;t the approaching Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>A plainer Narrative is made of the&s;e Liveries, <HI>Anno</HI> 16 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. when at the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Winde&s;or,</HI> the Queen, the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the King's Daughter, and Dutche&s;s of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> the King's Si&s;ter, had for their Livery Murrey Gowns embroidered with Garters.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e Robes worn by the Ladies at the Fe|&s;tivals of the Order, there &s;eems to be &s;ome Imitation of wearing a Garter al&s;o on their Left Arms, as the Knights did on their Left Leg, as it is ob&s;erv'd on the Counte&s;s of <HI>Tankervile</HI>'s Monument, where &s;he is &s;o pourtray'd.</P>
<P>AFTER a long Di&s;u&s;e of the&s;e Robes, <HI>Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. there was an endeavour to re&s;tore it; for the Deputy Chancellor &s;ollicited the Sovereign in Chapter, That the Ladies of the Knights-Companions might be granted the Privilege to wear a Garter of the Order a|bout their Arms, and an upper Robe at Fe&s;tival Times, according to ancient U&s;age, upon which Motion the Sovereign gave Order that the Queen's Plea&s;ure &s;hould be known herein, and the Affair left to the Ladies particular Reque&s;t, and the Year en&s;uing, upon the Deputy Chancellor's Report at another Chapter at <HI>Winde&s;or,</HI> it was then left to a Chapter to be called by the Knights-Companions, to preponderate of every Circum&s;tance, how it were fitte&s;t to be effected for the Honour and Lu&s;tre of the Order; which was ap|pointed to be held at <HI>London</HI> about <HI>All-hollantide</HI> next; But the unhappy War breaking out, this Matter en|tirely broke off.</P>

<P>&sect; 6. THERE remains now the Collar and <HI>George,</HI> brought in by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. And fir&s;t, of Collars in general, which is an Ornament not of late, but ancient Invention, and the wonderful Con&s;ent of mo&s;t Nations plead for it: Sacred Writ &s;ets down the Collar of Gold for one of the Ornaments <HI>Pharaoh</HI> conferr'd upon <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> The Images of <HI>I&s;is</HI> and <HI>O&s;iris</HI> were repre&s;ented with &s;uch like Collars, in a manner, extending to their Shoulders, as <HI>Kircher</HI> informs us. Their Workman&s;hip &s;eems won|derfully curious, being inter&s;ected with various Lines, and divided with Tablets and precious Stones. The Collar was of an illu&s;trious Original among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and gave Denomination to the Family of <HI>Torquati,</HI> de|&s;cended from <HI>L. Manlius,</HI> whom the Soldiers &s;urnam'd <HI>Torquatus,</HI> becau&s;e he fought with a Champion of the <HI>Gauls, Anno V. C.</HI> 392. and, having foil'd him in fight, cut off his Head, and then pluck'd off his Collar, bloody as it was, and put it about his own Neck. In further Memory of which Action were found &s;everal <HI>Roman</HI> Coins referring to <HI>L. Torquatus,</HI> Con&s;ul with <HI>L. Cotta, Anno V. C.</HI> 688. And it's remarkable that when one of another Tribe was adopted into this Fa|mily, he did al&s;o a&s;&s;ume this Badge of Honour, as in the Coin of <HI>D. Junius Silanus,</HI> tho' the Fa&s;hion of the Work &s;ome what differ'd from the former.</P>
<P>IN pri&s;tine Times none but Kings and Princes wore Collars, and therefore their U&s;e &s;eems of Dignity and Power, as is evident from <HI>Daniel,</HI> where the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Kings u&s;ed this Ornament. Afterwards Men famous for Wi&s;dom and Council, had them as a di&s;tingui&s;hing Badge, as in the Example of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and from the Pro|clamation of <HI>Bel&s;hazzar</HI> King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who propo&s;ed it as a Praemium to him that could interpret the Hand-Writing upon the Wall. And Men famous for Milita|ry Atchievements had it conferr'd upon them, in Re|compence of their Merits; thus Collars were of the Number of the <HI>Dona &amp; Praemia Militaria</HI> among the the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the Honour of receiving them thought wor|thy to be con&s;ign'd to Po&s;terity in Marble In&s;criptions. From them the later Emperors receiv'd it, and we read of inve&s;ting a Knight of the <HI>Holy Sepulchre</HI> with a
<PB N="174" REF="187">
Collar at his Creation; where, as &s;oon as the Ceremony of his Ordination is over, the Padre Guardian Ki&s;&s;es the new Made Knight, and puts about his Neck (according to the mode of the Ancients) a Golden Collar, with a Cro&s;s hanging at it.</P>
<P>MOST aptly therefore have the Sovereigns of Military Orders annex'd this Ornament of the Collar to their Habit, and conferr'd it on the Fellows and Companions, many of whom have meritoriou&s;ly de&s;erv'd it for their great Wi&s;dom and valorous Exploits, and for this rea|&s;on it was in&s;tituted in additional Glory to the En&s;igns of the Garter, compos'd in a peculiar manner, in Rela|tion to the Name and Title; to the wearing of which the Sovereign oblig'd both him&s;elf and Knights-Com|panions, and his and their Succe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>THIS Collar was ordain'd to be of Gold Thirty Ounces Troy weight, but not to exceed it; howbeit that Collar &s;ent to <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> weigh'd Thirty-four Ounces and a Quarter, and that of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. 35 Ounces and an Half; which, after his Sufferings, fell into the Hands of <HI>Thomas Harri&s;on,</HI> one of <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Major-Generals, and was by him deli|vered to the Tru&s;tees for Sale of the King's Goods: They, 1649. &s;ent it to the <HI>Mint,</HI> with divers of the <HI>Regalia,</HI> to &s;et the Stamp on work for the fir&s;t Gold that the up&s;tart Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on-wealth coin'd.</P>
<P>IT was appointed by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes, that this Collar &s;hould be compos'd of Pieces of Gold in Fa&s;hion of Garters, the Ground enamelled Blue, and the Letters of the Motto Gold; in the mid&s;t of each Garter, Two Ro&s;es plac'd, the innermo&s;t enamei|led Red, and the outermo&s;t White, contrarily in the next Garter, the innermo&s;t Ro&s;e enamelled White, and the outermo&s;t Red, and &s;o alternately; but of lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r Times the&s;e Ro&s;es are wholly Red.</P>
<P>THE Number of the&s;e Garters are &s;o many as be the ordain'd Number of the Sovereign and Knights-Com|panions; at the In&s;titution they were Twenty-&s;ix, be|ing fa&s;ten'd together with as many Knots of Gold, and this Mode hitherto has continu'd invariable; nor ought the Collar to be adorn'd or enrich'd with pre|cious Stones, (as the <HI>George</HI> may be) &s;uch being prohi|bited by the Law of the Order.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="188">
AT the Middle of the Collar before pendant, at the Table of one of the Garters in the Collar is to be fix'd the Image of St. <HI>George</HI> arm'd &s;itting on Hor&s;eback, who having thrown the Dragon on his Back encounters him with a Tilting-Spear. This Jewel is not encompa&s;s'd with a Garter or Row of Diamonds, as in the le&s;&s;er <HI>George;</HI> but in round Relief. It is allow'd to be beauti|fied and &s;ett off with Diamonds and other Enrichments, at the Plea&s;ure of the Knight-Companion who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and upon that Score it hath been frequently adorn'd with Variety of co&s;tly Work, whereon the Diamonds, and other precious Stones, being &s;et to that Advantage as might, upon its Motion and Agitation, dart forth a re&s;plendent Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>BEFORE the E&s;tabli&s;hment of this Article by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. it appears that the Knights-Companions were inve&s;ted with Collars at their In&s;tallations, for the Black Book makes mention of a Collar among the En&s;igns of the Garter, wherewith <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> was inve&s;ted, <HI>Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. but whether a Collar of SS's, or of another Model, is not &s;pecifi'd: Neverthe|le&s;s this Scruple is in part clear'd up by an old Memo|rial of the Ceremonies, at the Creating <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> Earl of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> 1 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. where it is &s;aid in the Annals, that after he was inve&s;ted with the Robes of his State and Dignity, the Collar of the Garter was put about his Neck at con&s;tituting him a Knight of the Order. And to make it more con&s;picuous in a Vellum Book of the Statutes &s;ent to <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperor, &s;ign'd 1508. by the Regi&s;ter <HI>T. Rowthale,</HI> and in another of <HI>Edward Stanley</HI> Lord <HI>Monteagle,</HI> elected <HI>ann.</HI> 6. <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. the Forty Fir&s;t Article, enjoins a Collar to be worn by each Knight-Companion expre&s;ly called the Collar of the Order, which tho' it be not in all Re&s;pects con&s;entient to that pre&s;cribed by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Sta|tutes, yet there is not much Variation, and 'tis reported to be a <HI>Gold Collar coupled together by &s;everal Pieces of Links, in Fa&s;hion of Garters, with a Vermilion Ro&s;e, and the Image of St.</HI> George <HI>hung thereat.</HI> The Rea&s;on of the Knights-Companions wearing it at the Times appointed, the Licen&s;e for putting it to mending, the Command not

So that he did but only annex to his Body of Statutes a Decree, which for the greate&s;t part had been put in practi&s;e before. In the 11th <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. upon Interpretation of the Eleventh Article of the Statutes, the Collar is there enumerated as part of the entire Robes that a Knight-Companion is oblig'd to wear, for a more convincing Proof, That the Collar of Garters was u&s;ed before King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Reign, the Monument of Sir <HI>Giles Daubeny</HI> plainly De|lineates (who departed 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII.) in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> where his Portraicture in the Robes of the Or|der is adorned with &s;uch a Collar as King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes do afterwards de&s;cribe.</P>

<P>BY the la&s;t Article of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's.

The Variety of Workman&s;hip in tho&s;e Gold Chains whereat this Jewel hung, was u&s;ually great, according to the Fancy and Plea&s;ure of the Per&s;ons for whom they were wrought. But within a &s;hort Space, wearing the le&s;&s;er George in Silk-Ribbands, as well as Gold-Chains, was promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly us'd and <HI>ad Libitum.</HI> (So were the Symbols of Fo|reign Orders, as divers Coins and Medals declare.)

<P>IT appears by a Letter of Sir <HI>Richard</HI> St. <HI>George,</HI> Kt. <HI>Clarencieux,</HI> dated <HI>July</HI> 10th, 1627. that the blue Ribband had &s;ome Years before been additional to the Ornament of the Order; and 'tis reported, that <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> ob&s;erving in <HI>France</HI> the Jewels of the Order of St. <HI>Michael</HI> and St. <HI>E&s;prit</HI> worn in blue Ribbands, upon his return was the principal motive tho&s;e Ribbands whereat the <HI>George</HI> hung, were exchanged into that Colour. And in a Picture of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> drawn towards the Declen&s;ion of her Reign, her le&s;&s;er George is repre&s;ented hanging before her Brea&s;t in a blue Rib|band.

<P>THE Manner of wearing this Ribband in time of Peace, was of later Times pendant about the Neck, down to the Middle of the Brea&s;t, where the le&s;&s;er George hung; but &s;ince, for the more Conveniency of Riding or Action, the &s;ame is &s;pread over the left Shoulder, and brought under the right Arm where the Jewel hangs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>

<P>In &s;hort, King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. ordained, That the Gold-Chain whereat the le&s;&s;er <HI>George</HI> (in that Age) hung, &s;hould be worn all other days in the Year, except the Principal and Solemn Fea&s;ts, whereon the great Collar was ordained to be worn, and except in time of War, Sickne&s;s, or long Voyage, in any of which Ca&s;es, a Silk-Lace or Ribband, with the Image of St. <HI>George</HI> thereat, was &s;ufficient; and the blue Ribband having &s;ince &s;uc|ceeded in Place of the Cold Chain, the Injunction of this Statute extends to it in all particulars.</P>

<P>UPON this Encouragement, the Bi&s;hop pre&s;ented a Petition, which was read in the Chapter at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI>

The proportion allowed to Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> for his Livery, <HI>Anno</HI> 14. <HI>Eliz.</HI> was 18 Yards of Murray Velvet, 12 Yards of Sarcenet for the Lining, one Garter wrought with Pearls of Damask Gold for the Shoulder, one Lace (or Cordon) with But|tons, and Ta&s;&s;els of blue Silk and <HI>Venice</HI> Gold, and the &s;ame Materials and Quantities were afterwards di&s;tri|buted out of the Sovereigns great Wardrobe, to the &s;ucceeding Chancellors.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Anno</HI> 13. <HI>Car.</HI> I. The Prelate and Chancellor en|deavouring a Reformation in this Habit, the Dye both of the Prelates and this Officers Robe was changed into Purple.</P>
<P>BESIDES this Robe, the Chancellor of the Order hath an honourable Badge of Di&s;tinction a&s;&s;igned him to wear, fir&s;t granted to Sir <HI>William Peters</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors, the 9th of <HI>October,</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Ph.</HI> and <HI>Mar. viz.</HI> a golden Ro&s;e enclo&s;ed within a Garter, which he and his Succe&s;&s;ors, Chancellors of the Order, have ever &s;ince worn daily about their Necks; at fir&s;t it was Pendant in a Gold-Chain, but &s;ince in a Purple Ribband.

<P>AMONG the Officers of the Order, the Chancellor is &s;eated next beneath the Prelate, and in all Proceedings and Se&s;&s;ions, goeth, and &s;itteth, on his left Hand: And as it was ordered by the Con&s;titutions of the Offi|cers, That if the Chancellor hapned to be a Layman, he &s;hould be al&s;o a Knight, and have other per&s;onal Endowments. So did King <HI>Charles</HI> I. conceive it requi|&s;ite to confer &s;ome further Mark of Di&s;tinction upon this Officer, in relation to Place and Precedence without the Order; to which effect, there pa&s;&s;ed a Decree in a Chapter a&s;&s;embled by the Sovereign at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 23d of <HI>April,</HI> 1623. pre&s;ent, the Earls of <HI>Mulgrave, Mont|gomery, Rutland, Carli&s;le, Holland, Suffolk, Pembroke, Arundel</HI> and <HI>Surrey, Salisbury, Dor&s;et, Bark-&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Northampton, That Sir</HI> Francis Crane, <HI>the pre&s;ent Chancellor, and all others that &s;hould &s;ucceed him in that Place hereafter, &s;hall, in right of that Place, in all A&s;&s;emblies, and upon all Occa&s;ions, be ranked and placed immediately aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r Knights-Privy-Councellors, and before the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Per&s;ons holding both Places, being in</HI> Pari gradu, <HI>and con&s;equently before all others, whom the &s;aid Chancellor is to precede,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>AND to the intent the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Place may be certainly known,</HI> May <HI>the 20th, 21</HI> Jac. <HI>I. it was thus e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> That the Knights of the Mo&s;t Noble Order of the Garter, the Privy-Councellors, the Ma&s;ter of the Courts of <HI>Wards</HI> and <HI>Liveries,</HI> the Chancellor and Under Trea&s;urer of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> Chancellor of the <HI>Dutchy,</HI> the Chief Ju&s;tice of the Court of <HI>King's Bench,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Rolls,</HI> the Chief Ju&s;tice of the Court of <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> the Chief Baron of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and all other Judges and Barons

of the Degree of the Coif, &s;hould have Place and Precedency in all Places, and upon all Occa&s;ions before the younger Sons of Vi&s;counts and Barons, and before all Baronets, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE afore&s;aid Con&s;titutions provide the Chancellor of the Order an Habitation within the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> as well as the Prelate, which is the South-We&s;t Tower in the lower Ward of the Ca&s;tle, call'd the <HI>Chancellor's Tower.</HI> The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof had been for &s;ome time in the Power of others; and therefore by a Chapter convened at <HI>White-hall, Nov.</HI> 5th, 5 <HI>Car.</HI> I. it was re&s;to|red unto Sir <HI>Francis Crane,</HI> then Chan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ellor of the Order, and after his Decea&s;e, to de&s;cend to his Succe&s;&s;ors. The&s;e Con&s;titutions al&s;o ordained him the like Live|ries at the Table and Court of the Sovereign, as were allowed to the Prelate.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t Erection of this Office, the Chancellor had no Pen&s;ion awarded him, until the Con&s;titutions in reference to the Officers were E&s;tabli&s;hed. At that time there was conferr'd on him a Pen&s;ion of 100<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> in con&s;ideration of his Employment, or el&s;e an allowance proportionate in Fees, Offices or other Pro|motions, over and above his Lodgings in the Ca&s;tle, and Liveries at Court. But as to Fees and Perqui&s;ites, there are none to be Claimed by this Officer; and for that Rea&s;on, he not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;aid Pen&s;ion, but all his disbur&s;ements allowed him, even to Paper, Wax, and Wafers; and indeed tho&s;e who enjoyed the Office e&s;teem'd it as a degradation of their Po&s;t, to re|ceive either fee, or gratuity for any affair Tran&s;acted within the Order; and Sir <HI>Thomas Rowe,</HI> &s;ometime Chancellor, affirmed <HI>That his Office was an Office of Hon|our, and not of Fees, and that he had always excepted again&s;t Fees, for the disbur&s;ement of the Sovereign's Money:</HI> Tho' he acknowledged &s;ome had be&s;towed on his Clerk a &s;mall gratuity, for the bare Ingro&s;&s;ing of an Alms Knights Pa|tent, but nothing farther.</P>
<P>AND becau&s;e the Cu&s;tody of the Seals of the Order, appertains to this Officer; it will be here the fitte&s;t Place to mention &s;omething of them. By the Statutes of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. they were to have a Common Seal. This is confirmed by the Statutes of King <HI>Hen.</HI> V. and &s;ince named the Great Seal of the Order. The u&s;e of this is
<PB N="201" REF="215">
not only to Seal the Original Statutes, appointed to re|main perpetually within the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> College, as al&s;o tho&s;e Copies of which each Knight-Companion is obliged to con&s;erve one, but likewi&s;e all Letters of Licence to any of the Knights-Companions de&s;irous of winning Honour abroad, and all Mandates and Certifi|cates, relating to the Order.</P>
<P>AFTER what Model the fir&s;t Seal was compos'd, we have no exact Relation. <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> tells us, That when the Founder of the Order had fixed Choice of St. <HI>George</HI> for its Patron, he repre&s;ented him Armed, and Mounted on an Hor&s;e, bearing a Silver Shield, and thereon a Red Cro&s;s, but whether St. <HI>George</HI> thus de|&s;igned, was on the fir&s;t Seal, or only a Scutcheon of his Arms, as in latter times, is uncertain. But his Author ob&s;erves that the Founder Habited his Soldiers in white Jackets or Coats, and on their Brea&s;ts and Backs &s;owed Red Cro&s;&s;es, parallel to the Arms a&s;&s;igned to St. <HI>George,</HI> as well as to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> put under his Patronage, which Arms the Sovereigns of the Order, have ever &s;ince exhibied in their Standards. But be|&s;ides this Common Seal King <HI>Hen.</HI> V. in the 9th Year of his Reign, In&s;tituted a privy Signet, in ca&s;e the Sove|reign &s;hould be called out of this Kingdom upon weighty Affairs. The intent thereof was to affix it to all Acts pa&s;&s;ed by the Sovereign beyond Sea, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e of his Deputies in <HI>England.</HI> King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII's Statutes, Ordain the making both of a Com|mon Seal and Signet, and direct that the Arms of the Order &s;hould be Engraven upon each of them. The Common Seal u&s;ed in his Reign was a Garter, within it a Shield having the Cro&s;s of St. <HI>George,</HI> impaling the National Arms, the &s;aid Shield encompa&s;&s;ed with two Branches hanging from the Regal Crown, which debru&s;es part of the Garter; the Signet being de&s;igned after the &s;ame manner, but le&s;s: <HI>Temp. Jac.</HI> I. it &s;uf|fered no other alteration, but only in the National Arms, by admitting the Quarterings of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and new-fa&s;hioning the Crown, omitting the &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the Shield.</P>
<P>THERE was a Seal made at the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>Cha.</HI> I. which being e&s;teemed too little for the Grandure and Honour of the Sovereigns Commi&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="202" REF="216">
it was afterwards Decreed in Chapter, held 18th of <HI>April.</HI> 13. Car. I. <HI>That a new one &s;hould be made of a larger Size, with the accu&s;tomed Arms and Motto, and the care thereof commited to Sir</HI> Thomas Rowe, <HI>Chancellor;</HI> which Command he Executed with all due care and re|gard, as is manife&s;tly evident by the noblene&s;s of the de&s;ign: One Repre&s;entation being St. <HI>George,</HI> in Ar|mour, adorned with a waveing Mantle, his Bever open, his Helmet plumed, holding a Shield of his Arms in his left Hand, and &s;triking with a Sword in his right, his Body mounted on a bold Hor&s;e, Trampling over a Dragon, which A&s;&s;ails the Champion, the whole Figure is well contracted, and the Sun, a Rock, the Bones of devoured Men, and a Mountain in <HI>Lointon,</HI> in it is Circum&s;cribed, <HI>Magnum &s;igillum Nobilis Or|dinis Garterij;</HI> having the enrichments of fe&s;tons be|tween every Word placed pentagonally: The other Repre&s;entation, is the Royal Garter imperially Crown|ed, enclo&s;ing a Shield of the Arms of St. <HI>George,</HI> im|paling the Sovereign's Arms, the &s;ame Bordered with Fret-work, and other Ornaments in Cartouche. In the &s;ame decree, direction was given al&s;o for a new Signet, the former being thought too big for Letters, and this was an Oval &s;haped &s;o from its Impre&s;&s;ion, which was the Garter Crowned, wherein was St. <HI>George,</HI> and the Sovereigns Arms impaled.</P>
<P>IT was at the &s;ame Chapter further 'decreed; <Q>That all Legations to deliver this Order to Foreign Princes, all other Acts, bearing the Stile of Com|mi&s;&s;ions, all Patents of Offices and Fees, all Grants or Licences &s;ent out of the Kingdom, &s;hould be Sealed with this Seal, which &s;hould be henceforward called the Great Seal of the Order; &s;o al&s;o the Book of Statutes, &s;ent to Elect Knights or Foreign Princes, being fixed to a Label of Blue Silk, and held ac|cording to antient Cu&s;tom; and that all Letters con|cerning the Order, whether of &s;ignification of Electi|on, or Lieutenancy, or Summons upon prorogation, or other Directions from the Sovereign, &s;hould only be Sealed with the Signet: Moreover, the&s;e Seals were appointed to be thenceforth Born before the Sovereign in all Publick A&s;&s;emblies, during the

<P>BY the Statutes of In&s;titution, it was ordained, That in ca&s;e the Knights-Companions, to who&s;e care the Sovereign did commit the Seal of the Order, &s;hould upon lawful Occa&s;ions, be ab&s;ent from Court, it be|hoves him to leave it behind him, with &s;ome other Knight-Companion to pre&s;ent, to the Sovereign, to the intent it might be always in readine&s;s; but if the Sovereign be out of His Kingdom, then the di&s;po|&s;al of it, was commited to the Deputies, and the Signet of the Order &s;hould have a Warrant for all &s;uch Acts and Decrees as &s;hould b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> confirmed there.</P>

<P>THE &s;ub&s;tance of his Oath in the Statute of the In&s;titutions was, <HI>That he &s;hould enter upon the Regi&s;try, with all Fidelity, the Scrutinies, Elections, Penalties, Reconciliations, and all other Acts relating to the Order,</HI> to which was ad|ded, that he &s;hall faithfully Di&s;charge his Duty in all things. But in King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIIIth Days, the Oath en|joyned him, differs nothing from that of the Prelates and Chancellors.</P>
<P>AT his Admi&s;&s;ion, he takes this Oath Kneeling, while the Prelate u&s;ed to pronounce the Words as <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Mar.</HI> 5. and 6. <HI>Ph.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> but in his ab&s;ence, as <HI>Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Chancellor admini&s;tred it. <HI>Anno</HI> 4. <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Prelate, Chancellor, and Regi&s;ter, took their Oaths at one time, and then it was thus Ordered; fir&s;t the Regi&s;ter took it Kneeling between the Sovereign's Knees, the Black Rod holding the Evangeli&s;ts, and the <HI>Garter</HI>

read the Words out of the black Book; this done, the Regi&s;ter read the Words of the Prelates Oath, when he was Sworn; and in the la&s;t place, did the like to the Chancellor; after this manner did Garter read the Words to the Regi&s;ters, admitted 11 <HI>Car.</HI> I. and 12 <HI>Car.</HI> II. We cannot trace the Habit this Officer had a&s;&s;igned him at the Erection of the Order; but it af|terwards appears, that his Allowance was the &s;ame with the Chancellors, con&s;i&s;ting of 5 Yards of Woollen Cloth, and 3 Timber of Minever gro&s;s, equalent to what tho&s;e Knights-Companions had allotted, who were under the degree of an Earl: The Habit he is pourtrayed in, at a proceeding of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIIIth Reign, &s;hews it to be Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, a black Gown, a Surplice over that, reaching to his Ancles, and thereon a Mantle of Furs; but the Con&s;titutions of his Office re&s;tricted him to none, wherein there &s;eems a defect, &s;ince they have a&s;&s;ignd Habits to the Garter, and black Rod. Notwith&s;tanding by a Draught of the Officers in their ancient Dre&s;s, it is plainly demon&s;trable to be a Mantle, &s;omewhat of a Ru&s;&s;el colour, Faced with a Pane of blue, whereon is Embroidred a Flower-de|luce Crowned Gold, then another Pane red, thereon a Lyon Pa&s;&s;ant gardant Crowned Gold, and &s;o they are al|ternately placed to the bottom; to this Mantle belong Cordons of Silk, blue and yellow.</P>
<P>SINCE that time, not only the Regi&s;ters, but al&s;o Gar|ters and Black Rods, Robes, underwent &s;ome Altera|tions; for by a Decree in Chapter, called at St. <HI>James, Jun.</HI> 1. 4 and 5. <HI>Ph.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> the&s;e Officers were a&s;&s;ign|ed Mantles of crim&s;on Satin, Lined with Taffaty, and a Scutcheon of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Arms, Embroidred on the left Shoulder, but not encircled with a Garter, having the &s;ame Buttons and Ta&s;&s;els as wereappointed to the Pre|late and Chancellor; the proportion of Satin a&s;&s;ign|ed to each Mantle, was 14 Yards, and as many Yards of white Taffaty.</P>
<P>AND tho' the Regi&s;ters Mantle was <HI>Ann.</HI> 27 <HI>Eliz.</HI> com|po&s;ed of the preceeding Materials, and had like Trim|ming, yet they agree not in their Proportions, here be|ing allowed 18 Yards of crim&s;on Satin, and but 12 of Taffaty; from hence the&s;e Mantles continued immutable

THIS was carried upon the Petition of the Gentle|men-U&s;hers, Daily-waiters, &s;econded by the Lord Cham|berlain, the Earl-Mar&s;hal; and others, Knights-Com|panions; as is evident from another Petition of theirs to the Sovereign in Chapter, a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the 17th of <HI>January,</HI> 20 <HI>Car.</HI> I.

<P>KING <HI>Charles</HI> I. having taken into his Hands the little Park of <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and be&s;tow'd it upon <HI>James Maxwell,</HI> then U&s;her of the Black-Rod, He, at a Chap|ter held at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 5th of <HI>November,</HI> 1629. de|creed, That as the Cu&s;tody of the &s;aid Park was con|ferr'd on <HI>Maxwell</HI> in right of his Office; &s;o the &s;ame &s;hould for ever after be annex'd thereto, and not to be di&s;po&s;ed of but under the Great Seal of the Order, and that only to the U&s;her of the Order for the time being.</P>

<P>BUT le&s;t it may be &s;uppos'd by &s;ome, that the Knights-Companions pre&s;ent in Chapter, can at their
<PB N="237" REF="247">
plea&s;ures nominate or propo&s;e to elect &s;uch Per&s;ons as they deem meet, &s;o they be qualify'd according to the Statutes, this Privilege is to be under&s;tood of Knights Subjects only: For in all Ca&s;es concerning Strangers, the Sovereign doth but barely grant them Sufferance, and may direct and confine the Knights-Companions to the Nomination of &s;uch as he at any time intends to Honour with Election, which Prerogative was particularly A&s;&s;er|ted, 31 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and 3 <HI>Car.</HI> I.</P>
<P>IN the Fir&s;t of the&s;e In&s;tances, the <HI>Blue Book</HI> of the Order recordeth, That at a Chapter held immediately before Ve&s;pers on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, the Earl of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> then Lieutenant for the Sovereign, made known to the Knights-Companions, <HI>That the Sovereign did permit them, or leave it to their Plea&s;ure to chu&s;e into the Order what&s;oever Foreign Prince they &s;hould by their Votes approve of.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we have two Points that offer them&s;elves to our Con&s;ideration. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Knights-Companions have not the Liberty to nominate what Foreign Prince they plea&s;e, but the &s;ame is derivative from the Sove|reign, and only by his Permi&s;&s;ion. <HI>Secondly,</HI> To weigh the Paragraph well, that <HI>Nominare</HI> ought to be ren|der'd or under&s;tood here by the Word <HI>Eligere,</HI> and that the Power delegated to the Knights-Companions from the Sovereign, was only to nominate, not elect; For it immediately follows, <HI>That the Knights-Companions went from the Chapter to the Second Ve&s;pers; and while the Divine Offices were celebrating, the Prelate receiv'd their Nominations, and that very Evening the Lieutenant pre&s;ented them to the Sovereign for her to con&s;ider of;</HI> which had been in&s;ignifi|cant and u&s;ele&s;s, if the Knights-Companions had been impower'd by her Licence to have made the Choice them&s;elves. But the contrary is evident; for the next Morning, all the Knights-Companions attending the Sovereign in Chapter, &s;he her&s;elf confirm'd there the Election not of any Foreign Prince, but of the Earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Buckhur&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>IN the other In&s;tance, <HI>Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Sovereign in a Chapter held before Ve&s;pers on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, &s;ig|nify'd it to be his Plea&s;ure (Three Stalls being then vacant) that <HI>out of Foreign Princes, the Nomination of whom,</HI> (&s;aith the Annals in that very Place) <HI>belongs only to the</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="248">
<HI>Sovereign,</HI> i. e. The Sovereign has the Prerogative to di|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ct the Knights-Companions to name, or impo&s;e upon them the Nomination of &s;uch Foreign Prince he plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eth they, the Knights-Companions, &s;hould pitch upon; which mu&s;t undoubtedly be under&s;tood to Nominate, or enter down into the Scrutiny, (not elect) <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> For a little after, it is evident, when the Scrutiny was pre&s;ented to the Sovereign, that him&s;elf, not the Knights-Companions, made Election of them.</P>
<P>AND it is further manife&s;t, by the Scrutiny there in|&s;erted, that both tho&s;e Princes were named by every of the Knights-Companions then pre&s;ent, according to the Sovereign's &s;ignification (which has been u&s;ually done at all other Times upon the like Occa&s;ions.) But concerning the third Per&s;on then to be Elected, the Sovereign, (intending him to be a Knight-Subject) left it entirely to their Plea&s;ure to Nominate whom&s;oever they thought worthy of their Votes. Since this Time, the Nominations in like Ca&s;es, have been &s;ufficiently acknowledg'd by the Knights-Companions them&s;elves, to be a Prerogative belonging &s;olely to the Sovereign. For to the End they might more expeditiou&s;ly and clearly &s;hew their Compliance, it was moved in a Chap|ter held at <HI>Oxford, March</HI> the 2d. 19 <HI>Car.</HI> I. <HI>That it might become a Cu&s;tom for the Sovereign to declare before-hand, whether he would<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">elect any Foreign Prince, and whom, that &s;o the Knights-Companions might be there to name him in the Scrutiny.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<P>&sect;. 7. ANOTHER Con&s;ideration in our Progre&s;s towards the Act of Election, is appertaining to the Number<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Qualifications and Dignities of the Per&s;ons nominated, which may be more con&s;picuou&s;ly re&s;olved from another Branch of the before-mention'd Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That every one of the Knights-Companions pre&s;ent at the Election &s;hould nominate for him&s;elf nine very &s;ufficient Per&s;ons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> whom he &s;hould judge free from all Reproach and Scandal, whether Subjects to the Sovereign, or Fo|reigners, Provided they are known not to Favour or Abet any Party at enmity with him; that is to &s;ay, three Earls, or others of higher Degree, three Barons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="239" REF="249">
and three Knights. Wherein the Things chiefly ob|&s;ervable, we rank under five Heads.</P>
<P>For the Fir&s;t of the&s;e, their Number. Every Knight-Companion a&s;&s;embl'd in Chapter, is injoin'd to name Nine, neither more nor le&s;s. So al&s;o faith King <HI>Henry</HI> V's Statutes. Nor are King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's. any ways di&s;&s;o|nant. And in this particular, the Statutes have been hitherto inviolably ob&s;erved, except in one Ca&s;e. As to Numbers, and the My&s;teries wrapt up in them, we &s;hall not further in&s;i&s;t upon. But why our Royal Founder &s;elected this particular Number above all other, unle&s;s he had &s;ome Eye, and tacit Reflection on the Nine Worthies, or a treble threefold Cord and Symbol of perfect Stability and &s;olid Amity, the Number Nine is accounted to &s;ignifie, can with no great Facility or Certainty be decypher'd.</P>
<P>As to the Second Point, they ought to be of un|&s;potted Character. The Injunction in the Statutes of In&s;titution takes Order, that the Per&s;ons de&s;igned for Election, &s;hould be <HI>free from all Reproach, and of untaint|ted Reputation;</HI> and according to tho&s;e of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. are to be <HI>the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ufficient Knights, and free&s;t from Reproach.</HI> To the &s;ame purpo&s;e the Exemplar in the Black-Book, <HI>Such as are fitte&s;t,</HI> and whom they who Nominate <HI>believe to be free from Ignominy and Di&s;honour.</HI> And to this Act of Nomination belongs part of the Second Article in <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's Statutes, <HI>That no Knight-Companion &s;hould name any Per&s;on whom he thinks or e&s;teems in his Con&s;cience to have upon him any Spot of Reproach.</HI> But on the Contrary in another Place of the &s;ame Sta|tutes it is Provided, That they be nominated and pro|po&s;ed <HI>out of the Number of the mo&s;t worthy and &s;elect Knights.</HI></P>
<P>How tender the Knights-Companions were in pri|&s;tine Times of infringing this particular, is proved from a notable Pa&s;&s;age which happen'd <HI>Ann.</HI> 39 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. at a Scrutiny taken the 8th of <HI>February,</HI> in the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s Palace, where <HI>John de Foix</HI> Earl of <HI>Kendal,</HI> a <HI>Ga&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oigner</HI> by birth, (which makes the Example more eminent, that a Stranger &s;hould have &s;o great Regard to the Honour of the Order) not being acquainted with the Quality and Merit of Knights and Honourable Per&s;ons

among&s;t us &s;o well and demon&s;trably as to nomi|nate &s;uch whom he was confident were irreprehen&s;ible, forbore to mention any Per&s;ons at all. And certainly, &s;eeing the Statutes put very con&s;iderable Qualifications upon the Deputies and Proxies, made choice for the In&s;tallation of Strangers (as el&s;ewhere &s;hown) much more C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ution and Regard ought to be u&s;ed both in the Nomination and Election of Knights into this radiant and illu&s;trious Society.</P>
<P>THE third Head the Statutes render indifferently capable of being nominated or elected, either Knights Subjects, or Strangers, [Free Princes or their Subjects.] And it was &s;o even at the Election upon the fir&s;t Choice, where among the Twenty five E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ected Knights, Twenty three of them were Subjects. And this was the con&s;tant Cu&s;tom not only in the remaining Part of the Founders Reign, and during tho&s;e of his three Succe&s;&s;ors, but has continued ever &s;ince, as appears from the Scrutinies taken and entred throughout the Annals of the Order.</P>
<P>OF tho&s;e who have gain'd admi&s;&s;ion into this Noble Order by Election, we &s;hall in the la&s;t Chapter give an Account in a compleat Catalogue of them, and likewi&s;e in&s;ert the Names of &s;uch as have mi&s;&s;ed their Election, yet are not to be buried in Oblivion, out of this very re|&s;pect, that by their &s;tanding Candidates, have the Fame of being enrolled in the Principal Regi&s;ter of Honour now in the Chri&s;tian World. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed we &s;hould give a Li&s;t of all, (for that were a Task too laborious, and wou'd prove too numerous) but only of tho&s;e of eminent Quality in foreign Parts, with the Aera when the Scrutinies were taken.</P>

<P>THIS Duty was executed by the Regi&s;ter from the 15th Year of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to the Period of his and his Son's Reign, as the <HI>Black-Book</HI> of the Order fully evinces; as al&s;o on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1. <HI>Eliz.</HI> by <HI>John Boxhall;</HI> and at the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George</HI> held <HI>Ann.</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. by <HI>Giles Thomp&s;on,</HI> who in the &s;everal Times were Regi&s;ters, yet we mu&s;t not mi&s;take that what they officiated was on their own behalf, but &s;upply'd the Place of the Prelate.</P>
<P>IN the Beginning of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, we find the Chancellor of the Order began to perform this Ser|vice, being by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's Statutes adjoined to tho&s;e other Offices before de&s;crib'd, to collect the Scru|tinies in ab&s;ence of the Prelate, and thereby made ca|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ble of the Employment, which afterwards is tacitly remark'd to be perform'd as if in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> own right, when the Regi&s;ter has only effected it in the Chancellor's ab|&s;ence, tho' in reality it was no other, than as in the In&s;tance of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dure&s;me</HI> and Dr. <HI>Day</HI> afore&s;aid, who took the Scrutiny in the Vacancy of the Office, and ab&s;ence of the Regi&s;ter.</P>

<P>WHEREIN the &s;econd Divi&s;ion are Ranked the Barons and Vi&s;counts, for Vi&s;counts in all Scrutinies, after the fir&s;t Erection of that Dignity, were on the &s;ame level with the Barons, until the 3 of <HI>Jac.</HI> I.

And &s;o was it performed when the Prince of <HI>Denmark,</HI> Dukes of <HI>Monmouth, Cambridge,</HI> and <HI>Albemarle,</HI> received their Inve&s;titure in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. The Garter, as it was the fir&s;t, &s;o is the prin|cipal and mo&s;t worthy En&s;ign of the Order; and, in the Practice of all former Times, had always the Preference given to it. The Inve&s;titure with the&s;e two En&s;igns, hath generally been performed by the two &s;enior Knights, at the Command of the Sovereign; but always in his Pre&s;ence, the Chapter &s;itting; but if ab&s;ent, then by his Lieutenant. For, in 31 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Lord <HI>Buckhur&s;t</HI> being elected at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and coming to Court wholly igno|rant of the Affair, and after the Sovereign was ri&s;en, (yet leaving the Chapter &s;itting) her Lieutenant inve&s;ted him both with the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>George.</HI> After the Solemnity is compleated, the elect Knight renders mo&s;t humble Thanks to the Sovereign, and with due Re&s;pects &s;alutes the Knights-Companions, who re-&s;alute the elect Knight, and joyfully receive him into their Society. If two or more elect Knights receive this Inve&s;titure at one time,
<PB N="280" REF="290">
as &s;oon as the Senior is inve&s;ted, and his humble Thanks pre&s;ented, he moves downwards towards the Chapter-Hou&s;e Door, and there &s;tands till the next Junior Knight is inve&s;ted; and if there be more, &s;o on until the Chapter break up.</P>

<P>&sect; 4. Where a Knight-Subject, at the time of his Ele|ction, is far di&s;tant from Court, or beyond Sea, and the Sovereign determines to &s;end him the Two principal En|&s;igns of the Order, the Charge of this Employ does of right belong to the <HI>Garter.</HI> For the Proof of which there are divers Precedents.</P>
<P>The Letters heretofore &s;ent from the Sovereign, along with the En&s;igns of the Order, to the elect Knights, have, for the mo&s;t part, been drawn after the Form of tho&s;e that certify the Election, and differs only in the la&s;t Clau&s;e, which requires the elect Knight to repair to the Sove|reign: The difference lay not in the Body, but in the Direction of the Letter, which was always worded ac|cording to the Quality of the Per&s;on to whom it was &s;ent. As to a Knight-Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">chelor, the Direction was, <HI>To our tru|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y and well-beloved;</HI> and to an Earl, <HI>Right tru&s;ty, and rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t well-beloved Cou&s;in;</HI> to a Duke, <HI>Right tru&s;ty, and right en|tirely beloved Cou&s;in,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Forms of tho&s;e Letters, &s;ent upon like Occa&s;ions to Knights-Subjects, when King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was beyond Sea, were penn'd after another Model, and contained other additional particular Clau&s;es; as, 1. Power to wear the <HI>Star</HI> of Silver about St. <HI>George</HI>'s Cro&s;s; 2. The Great Collar of the Order; and, 3. To &s;tyle them&s;elves <HI>Knights, and Companions of the Order of the Garter,</HI> in as ample a Manner, as if they had been in&s;talled at <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> with an A&s;&s;urance of receiving the whole Habit there, when the Sovereign was re&s;tored to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof.</P>
<P>And it appears from &s;ome of the&s;e Letters, that by rea|&s;on Sir <HI>Edward Walker,</HI> Garter, was otherwi&s;e employ'd in the Service of the Sovereign, when they were tran&s;|mit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, the Sovereign pitch'd upon other Per&s;ons, to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|ry both the Letters and En&s;igns of the Order, and yet continued the Garter in the Rights of his Office. How|ever, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> e&s;teeming this devolving his Employ|ment on others, as an Inva&s;ion on the Rights of his Office; and having a ju&s;t regard for the Intere&s;t of his Succe&s;&s;ors,

<P>It was formerly the Practice, to &s;end the Book of Sta|tutes, under the common Seal of the Order, together with the Letters &s;ignifying an Election, and the En&s;igns of the Order, no le&s;s to a Knight Subject than to a Stranger, that he might peru&s;e and advi&s;e thereupon, whether he would accept of the Election, or not; for &s;o it appears, <HI>Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. by the Letters &s;ent to Sir <HI>John Fal&s;toff.</HI></P>

THE Inauguration of a Knight of this mo&s;t Noble Order, con&s;i&s;ts in a Conjunction of many Ceremonies, and contains the mo&s;t &s;olemn part of tho&s;e, which compleateth all the re&s;t; and till this great Solemnity be regularly and duly per|formed, the Per&s;on elected hath not the Honour to be enrolled among the Number of Founders, but barely pa&s;&s;es for an elect Knight, and no other: For the Sta|tute expre&s;ly &s;ays, That in Ca&s;e a Knight elect die be|fore his In&s;tallation, He &s;hall not be named one of the Founders; and the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it is, becau&s;e he hath not had the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his E&s;tate, and in this Point do the other Bodies of the Statutes agree. But when the Ceremonies of In&s;tallation are compleatly fini|&s;hed, without all doubt the Knight is amply ve&s;ted, in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Honours and Privileges appertaining to the Founder of this mo&s;t Noble Order. But to &s;pur up each elect Knight, who is either a Subject to his Sove|reign, or re&s;ides within the Realm, (and con&s;equently i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> better able to provide for In&s;tallment, than one remaining

For which rea&s;on, when certain Articles, tending to the Honour of the Or|der, had been prepared by the Sovereign's Lieutenant and ten Knights-Companions, in a Chapter held the 24th of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 21 <HI>Jacobus</HI> I. ratified by the Sovereign, and ordered to be ob&s;erved; one of them was for acce|lerating the In&s;tallation, after the Knight had been ele|cted, yet qualified with this Exception: <HI>Unle&s;s for &s;ome &s;pecial Cau&s;e the Sovereign &s;hou'd think fit to defer the &s;ame until the Eve or Day of St.</HI> George <HI>next following, the Time of Election.</HI></P>

<P>Although it has been made apparent, that the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> at their Election or In&s;tallation, &s;ucceeded the immediate <HI>defunct Knight</HI> in his Stall, yet we may ob|&s;erve, that &s;ometimes after In&s;tallation, as an e&s;pecial &s;ig|nal of Favour and Indulgence, the Sovereign hath been plea&s;ed, though very rarely, to advance a <HI>Knight-Com|panion</HI> to a higher Stall than that wherein he was fir&s;t placed; and though there be no &s;uch Permi&s;&s;ion granted by the Law of the Order, yet we find <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> removed from the &s;eventh Stall on the Prince's &s;ide, to the Prince's Stall it &s;elf, and it's &s;aid to be done by the Decree of the Sovereign and the <HI>Knights-Compa|nions.</HI> And no doubt but as this was done by &s;o good Authority, and &s;o upon no le&s;s enducements to the Sove|reign, and the whole Society. We &s;hall here mention a few of the&s;e extraordinary Ca&s;es. <HI>William Henalt,</HI> Earl of <HI>O&s;tervant,</HI> was advanced by King <HI>Richard</HI> II. from the eleventh Stall on the Sovereign's &s;ide, to the Duke of <HI>Britain</HI>'s, being the &s;econd on the Prince's &s;ide. <HI>Humphry</HI> Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. was removed from the eleventh Stall on the Sovereign's &s;ide, to the &s;econd on the &s;ame &s;ide; and <HI>Richard Nevil,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> by the Con&s;ent of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> in Chapter, <HI>Anno</HI> 39 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. was tran&s;lated to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Stall; the Lord <HI>Bonvil,</HI> to the Lord <HI>Scales</HI>'s Seat; Sir <HI>Thomas Kyriell,</HI> to the Place of the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wenlock,</HI> to the Stall of Vi&s;count <HI>Beaumont.</HI> But King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. thinking it requi&s;ite for the Sovereign of this mo&s;t Noble Order, to be impow|ered by a General, how to Act that at Plea&s;ure, which the former Sovereigns did not, but by the Power of par|ticular Acts, or Orders, in the Chapter; after he had confirmed the ancient Law of &s;ucceeding in the Stall of the immediate Predece&s;&s;or, and not to &s;uffer an alteration without the Sovereign's Licence, in the next Article he e&s;tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;hed this Privilege upon Him&s;elf and Succe&s;&s;ors: <HI>That if there were any Place or Stall void, the Sovereign, at his own Plea&s;ure, might Advance and Tran&s;late any Knight</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="307">
<HI>of the Society into the void Stall, &s;o that it were higher than that, wherein he &s;ate before.</HI></P>
<P>This in Effect did vacat the ancient Law of &s;ucceeding in Stalls, though at the &s;ame Time he &s;eem'd to Confirm it to the <HI>Knights-Subjects,</HI> for afterwards Tran&s;lations pre|ceeding to In&s;tallations, became &s;o frequent, that the Right an <HI>elect Knight</HI> had to his Predece&s;&s;or's Stall, was &s;eldom enjoyed. However, hereby he confirmed a Power to gratify &s;uch of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> as he &s;hou'd think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">it to advance, without having recour&s;e to a Chapter; and from hence began the Cu&s;tom to I&s;&s;ue out Warrants, under the Sovereign's <HI>Sign Manual,</HI> for the Tran&s;lation of Stalls, and con&s;equently the alteration and removal of &s;uch of the <HI>Knights-Companions Helms, Cre&s;ts, Banners,</HI> and <HI>Plates,</HI> who &s;hou'd receive a higher Exaltation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Power e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the Sovereigns of this mo&s;t Noble Order, of tran&s;lating Stalls, when a va|cancy happened, they farther added this larger Preroga|tive: That the Sovereign, once in his Life, might, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t plea&s;ed him, make a general Tran&s;lation of all the Stalls at his P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;ure, except of Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Dukes, who &s;hou'd keep their Stalls and Places, unle&s;s advanced to a higher Room and Stall. In which Tran&s;|lation, the long continuance in the Order, and the Prai&s;es, Worthine&s;s, and Merits of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> were to be con&s;idered and remembred.</P>
<P>But this Branch of the Sovereign's Prerogative, as far as we can find, was never put in Execution, though the Tran&s;lation, <HI>Anno</HI> 27 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. border'd &s;omething u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on it, perhaps left it might rai&s;e too great Feuds among the <HI>Knights-Subjects;</HI> fora&s;much as that of tran&s;lating only, (when there happened a vacancy,) begot great Emulations, which at length introduced a Change, to which we &s;hall pa&s;s, after we have taken notice of a Clau&s;e added in the twenty &s;econd Article of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes, re|lating to Princes.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable the ancient Law of &s;ucceeding in Stalls, in relation to them, was wholly altered. For King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. upon the E&s;tabli&s;hment of his Body of Sta|tutes, not only appointed tho&s;e Strangers, then pre&s;ent of the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">der, to be &s;eated next him&s;elf; but that all Empe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, Kings, and Princes, &s;hould hold their Stalls after their E&s;tates, and the very next unto the Sovereign, tho'
<PB N="298" REF="308">
<HI>Knights-Subjects,</HI> upon vacancy, become removable at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> II. and after him <HI>Rudolph</HI> II. his Son, had the Prince's Stalls a&s;&s;igned them after their Election into the Order; and &s;everal of the Kings of <HI>France</HI> were placed in the next below, be|ing the &s;econd on the Sovereign's &s;ide. And when there chanced to be more than one King at a time in the Or|der, the &s;econd Stall on the Prince's &s;ide was a&s;&s;igned him; for Precedency was mea&s;ured now by Dignity and State, and not by the Antiquity of the Order; As appears from the King of <HI>Bohemia, Anno</HI> 19 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and the King of <HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 8 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Princes Stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gers, accor|ding to their regality, and illu&s;trious extraction, had their Scituation next to Kings, as is manife&s;t from the Dukes of <HI>Savoy, Montmorency,</HI> and <HI>Hol&s;tein, Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>Frederick</HI> Prince <HI>Palatine,</HI> and <HI>Maurice</HI> Prince of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ange, Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Jac.</HI> I.</P>

<P>When this Letter was i&s;&s;ued out, the Sovereign in|tended to create the Prince Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> which Ceremonies were intended to begin at the old <HI>Palace-yard</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> upon the 21&s;t Day of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Car</HI> I. and to Solemnize the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George,</HI> upon the 23d of the &s;ame Month at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and to take the Scru|tiny that Evening for his Election into this Order: The next Day was de&s;igned to inve&s;t him with the Garter and George, and the Day after to &s;et forward the Caval|cade towards <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> wherein al&s;o the Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> (intended to be created with the Prince,) were to Ride with their Robes. But this Re&s;olution being alter|ed, &s;top'd the Progre&s;&s;ion of the Cavalcade, and in the room of a Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> he was created a <HI>Knight-Batchellor</HI> at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI></P>

<P>After the <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> had entered the Ca&s;tle, the Canons Re&s;ident were, by the afore&s;aid Article, ap|pointed to meet and recieve him, and with due Reve|rence conduct him into the Choir.

<P>&sect; 4. Before we come to the particular Ceremonies of the In&s;tallation, tran&s;acted either by the Sovereign, (or in his ab&s;ence by his Lieutenant or Commi&s;&s;ioners,) we &s;hall premi&s;e this general Remark: That &s;ince neither the Statutes of <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> nor tho&s;e of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. afford us a Formulary for the Per&s;onal In&s;tallation of a Knight elect; yet tho&s;e enacted by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. do briefly exhibit the Order and Method of it.

<P>The Attendance to be given upon the Sovereign's Lieu|tenant, and &s;uch of the Knights-Companions as are appoin|ted for his A&s;&s;i&s;tants, is by the Officers of the Order and of Arms, the Prebends and Alms-Knights, either at his Lodgings, or el&s;ewhere he &s;hall deem meet to appoint; from which the Knights-Companions are exempt.

We pre&s;ume the Que&s;tion, (what&s;oever it was) chanced not to be propounded, till the proceeding was ready to pa&s;s on, and then &s;tarted on a &s;udden, becau&s;e the Heralds (as the Annals note,) did not quickly di&s;cypher the mat|ter, that it proceeded more from &s;urprize, than want of Ability to re&s;olve.</P>

<P>Neverthele&s;s, there was a Que&s;tion moved 12 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. whether the u&s;age of wearing the Hood &s;hould not be re|&s;tored to the left Shoulder, but it &s;eems it was over-ruled; and 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II. &s;ome of the Knights-Companions ima|gining it mo&s;t proper to wear their Hoods on their left Shoulders, ran into that error, but upon better informa|tion the next Morning, altered them to the right.

<P>&sect; 6. The Knight elect, habited as before, proceeds from the Chapter-Hou&s;e along the North I&s;le, and enters the We&s;t Door of the Choir in &s;olemn Order; but his Place in this proceeding is changed, for here he is led be|tween two Knights-Companions. This is noted in the Black-Book to be the Order wherein <HI>Albra Va&s;ques d'Al|madea,</HI> Earl of <HI>Averence,</HI> and two others, proceeded to their In&s;tallations, 24 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. And notwith&s;tanding the Statutes of In&s;titution, and tho&s;e made by King <HI>Henry</HI> V. are &s;ilent in the Order of this Proceeding; yet for an elect Knight to be led to his Stall between two fellow Knights, is no modern Ceremony; &s;ince we likewi&s;e find, that the Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">count <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">urchier,</HI> 30 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. pa&s;t to his In&s;talment between the Lord <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI> and Lord <HI>Beauchamp.</HI> But the Order of proceeding is preci&s;ely &s;et down in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes, <HI>viz.

<P>In all ca&s;es where the Sovereign is pre&s;ent at an In&s;tal|lation, after the cu&s;tom of inve&s;ting with the Collar in the Chapter-Hou&s;e was left off, it is generally to be ob|&s;erved, that as &s;oon as the Inve&s;titure with the Surcoat is fini&s;hed, the Sovereign pa&s;&s;es from the Chapter-Hou&s;e into the Choir, with the whole proceeding before him, leaving the elect Knight behind; and when he and the Knights-Companions have taken their Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ls, the two Senior Knights-Companions, by the Sovereign's verbal Directions, de&s;cend from their Stalls, and &s;tand under their Banners, whil&s;t the Alms-Knights, but not the Pre|bends, Officers of Arms, and the three inferior Officers of the Order, pa&s;s out of the Choir, and proceed before them to the Chapter-Hou&s;e, from whence they introduce the elect Knight into the Choir to his In&s;tallation; but if there be more than one Knight in&s;talled, then the two next Senior Knights de&s;cend, and &s;o the next, till all the elect Knights are conducted in: And this cour&s;e is like|wi&s;e ob&s;erved when a Lieutenant is c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;tituted, and hath been generally &s;o practi&s;ed &s;ince the Inve&s;titure with the Collar was performed in the Choir; and particularly at the In&s;tallations of the Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s of <HI>Pem|brook, Marr,</HI> and <HI>Southamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">n,</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. and of the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> 3 <HI>Jac.</HI> I.

<HEAD>Of &s;etting up the Knight's Atchievements.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 11. The la&s;t thing to be done at this great Solemnity, is &s;etting up the <HI>Helm, Cre&s;t, Sword, Banner,</HI> and <HI>Plate,</HI> of the new in&s;talled Knight, over his Stall in the Chappel of St. <HI>George;</HI> to which purpo&s;e they are to be provided, according to the Directions before given.</P>
<P>By the Statutes of In&s;titution it is ordained, that the time for &s;etting up the Atchievements &s;hall be when the elect Knight comes to <HI>Wind&s;or-Ca&s;tle,</HI> that is, to his In|&s;tallation, and not before; and the rea&s;on is there like|wi&s;e given, le&s;t it &s;hould happen, he not coming for his In&s;tallation within the time limitted, and con&s;equently the vacating his Election en&s;uing, that a new Election being made, tho&s;e military En&s;igns might not &s;eem to be di&s;|gracefully withdrawn, and an occa&s;ion of Di&s;honour given, which otherwi&s;e could not be avoided, if they &s;hould be &s;uddenly taken down from a Place &s;o high; which de|mon&s;trates, that the intention of this Article extends to the fini&s;hing the Ceremonies of In&s;tallation, before the At|chievements ought to be &s;et up, by &s;o carefully providing again&s;t the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;honour of taking them down, in ca&s;e the Election &s;hould become void; which mu&s;t infallibly hap|pen, if the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ight elect died but an Hour before he were compleatly in&s;talled. Accordingly, in the ancient Depu|tations both to Sir <HI>William Philip,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Fal&s;taff,</HI> Power is given their Proctors fir&s;t to demand, receive, and obtain their principal Stalls, and next to tender their Helms, and Swords, to be hung up in the Choir of <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> according to Cu&s;tom: And for clearer Informa|tion of the cour&s;e of this Ceremony, that the Sovereign impowered his Commi&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ers, fir&s;t to give the De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uty Po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion of his Principal's Stall, and after to receive the Atchievements, and place them over it: This is to be con&s;idered as a Memorial of the Knights being in&s;talled a Companion of the Order, and 'tis incongruous in the Rules of Honour to have the Sign or a Memorial of an Action precede the Action it &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f.</P>

are no Fees due, nor can be claimed, till the Ceremonies on which they become due are entirely fini&s;hed.

<P>And though this was the Practice anciently, yet were the Atchievements always prepared and brought to <HI>Wind|&s;or,</HI> and &s;et before the elect Knight's Stall; and in ca&s;e of his not coming to receive In&s;tallation, then, being no otherwi&s;e placed, they might be the ea&s;ier removed with|out the Choir, in as decent manner as could be, &s;o that the Honour of Knighthood might be pre&s;erved entire; ne|verthele&s;s, to be retained for publick U&s;e, and the Be|nefit of the College.</P>
<P>Where mention is made in the Annals of any Per&s;on employed to &s;et up the Atchievements of a Knight, it is to be under&s;tood that he was his Proctor, and in&s;talled on his behalf: And there appears but one &s;ingle In&s;tance where one Per&s;on hath hung up a Knight's Atchievements, when another was in&s;talled for him; and this happen'd 14th of <HI>Augu&s;t, Anno</HI> 29 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. where the Lord <HI>Rivers</HI> having been elected to the Stall of the Lord <HI>Hungerford,</HI> his Sword and Helm were &s;oon after (&s;ent) hung up by <HI>William Bobden,</HI> his E&s;q; and <HI>Guyen Herald,</HI> and he in&s;talled the 30 <HI>October</HI> following, by Sir <HI>William Craf|ford</HI> his Proctor; but this was contrary to the Law of the Order.</P>

<P>&sect; 1.

<P>It was therefore by the <HI>Statutes</HI> ordained: That when any &s;uch &s;hould be cho&s;en into the <HI>Order,</HI> they &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ertified of their Elections by the Sovereign; and be&s;ides, that, at his Charge, the <HI>Garter</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent over to them, with the <HI>Mantle</HI> and <HI>Statutes</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> Sealed with the common Seal; &s;o that they might have notice, at+lea&s;t within four Months from the time of Election, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd they might advi&s;e and determine with them&s;elves, fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m the Tenor of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> whether they would re|ceive the Honour of this mo&s;t <HI>Noble Order.</HI></P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance of the&s;e Directions, it became cu&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mary for the Sovereign, when he &s;ent his Letters, to &s;end al&s;o, and that by way of &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;y, the Habit and En&s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> or the <HI>Order,</HI> with a Book of the <HI>Statutes;</HI> and in ca&s;e the Election were accepted, Inve&s;titure might be re|ceived before the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">turn of the Per&s;ons, by whom the

<P>The right of bearing the&s;e Letters &s;ignifying Election, and returning the Strangers An&s;wer, belongs to <HI>Garter,</HI> by the Con&s;titutions of his Office. And though Certi|ficate of Election was to be made within f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ur Months from the time of Election, yet King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. added this nece&s;&s;ary Clau&s;e: <HI>That when the Sovereign had any great or high Impediment, he might defer certifying the Election till a more convenient Time.</HI> As may be &s;een in the ca&s;e of <HI>Frederick</HI> III. Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> in the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">me of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. who having been elected 35 of that King, had not Letters &s;ent him to &s;ignify it till the next Year. It likewi&s;e appears, that Letters to the &s;ame Effect were then likewi&s;e di&s;patched to the King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who had been elected eight Years before.</P>
<P>And yet we find it recorded, that the <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>En|&s;igns</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> were &s;ent by &s;pecial Amba&s;&s;adors to all three, 34 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. two Years before: But perhaps this ought to be under&s;tood of their being but then de&s;ign'd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and ordered to be &s;ent, and on &s;econd Thoughts might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;topped, or if &s;ent, by &s;ome accident might have mi&s;car|ried; otherwi&s;e it &s;eems needle&s;s to have &s;ent other Let|ters to give notice of their Election two Years after: But to clear this matter, we after find a &s;econd mention of &s;ending the <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>En&s;igns</HI> to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> 37 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. by which it is demon&s;trable, that the fir&s;t Emba&s;&s;y took no Effect.</P>
<P>It does not appear that King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. or any of his Succe&s;&s;ors, ever made u&s;e of that Liberty granted by the afore&s;aid Article of his <HI>Statutes,</HI> for deferring the &s;ignifi|catory Letters of El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ction beyond the time appointed by t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>Statutes</HI> of In&s;titution, as we find by the many In|&s;tances of that kind. <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t King of <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ance</HI> was elected <HI>Oct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ber</HI> 21. 19 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and was in&s;talled the 25 <HI>January</HI> following; &s;o that 'tis plain, the Letters of No|ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e mu&s;t needs have been di&s;patched within the limited Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mes</HI> V. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was elected 20 <HI>Jan.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">6 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. had notice of Election immediately &s;ent him; and <HI>Hen.</HI> II. of <HI>Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> having been elected 24

<P>But for an in&s;tance, after the &s;aid additional Clau&s;e, there is one remarkable enough, in the Preamble of the Sovereign's <HI>Credential Letters</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Phil.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> &s;ent with the Habit and En&s;igns of the <HI>Order;</HI> in which it appears: <HI>That the Sovereign having given notice of his Election into this mo&s;t Noble</HI> Order, <HI>he had returned back his cheerful and ready Acceptance of, and &s;ingular Satisfaction in the &s;aid Choice; and therefore cor|dially wi&s;hed it might attain its due Effect.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;ucceeding Times it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, where the whole <HI>Habit</HI> was &s;ent to a <HI>Stranger,</HI> together with the Sovereign's Letters of notice, to make a provi&s;ional De|cree, (which pa&s;&s;ed, 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I.) <HI>That Garter, and all others, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e plea&s;ed to join in Commi&s;&s;ion with him, &s;hould be mo&s;t punctually careful, that they delivered not the</HI> En&s;igns <HI>of the</HI> Order <HI>to any</HI> elect Stranger, <HI>till they were &s;atisfied, by his</HI> Letters Patent, <HI>of his kind and grate|ful Acceptance thereof;</HI> or in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, to forbear their Pre&s;entation.</P>

<P>&sect; 5. That &s;ometimes this Honour hath not been accept|ed, appears in the &s;ingle ca&s;e of <HI>Philip</HI> II.

The Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> it &s;eems, made no An&s;wer to this Letter: It was therefore again debated at the next Year's Fea&s;t, and then thought fit, to &s;end Per|&s;ons over to him with the Nomination, who &s;hould pre&s;s him for his final An&s;wer. And then it appears, that the &s;aid Duke weighing the Statutes, and reflecting on the Quarrels between the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> his Unckle, made a plau&s;ible Excu&s;e, refu&s;ing the Election, le&s;t he &s;hould be forced e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ther di&s;honou|rably to violate the pious Con&s;titutions of the <HI>Order,</HI> or the obligations of Alliance; and upon this they proceeded to a new E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ction.</P>
<P>But this is the only in&s;tance of this kind; and it hath been the con&s;tant way of all elect Strangers, not only to accept, but to receive with the highe&s;t Marks of Satis|faction, the notice of their Election, and the Inveititure of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>

<P>And therefore we find it &s;ix Years after the Election of the Kings of <HI>Arragon</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;|wick,</HI> e'er we meet with the fir&s;t notice of the Sovereign's determination of &s;ending over the Habit: For they having been elected 4 <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 28 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. the preparations for the <HI>Legation</HI> were not made till the thirty fourth Year of the &s;ame King; and doubtle&s;s &s;ome cau&s;e, within the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s of that conveniency allowed to the Sovereign by the afore&s;aid Article of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> or the accident of Mi&s;carriage might fall out; particularly in re&s;pect to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> becau&s;e three Years after the former Order of <HI>Legation,</HI> we find new Directions i&s;&s;ued for &s;ending the En&s;igns of the <HI>Order</HI> to him.</P>
<P>But in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's Body of <HI>Statutes,</HI> this Clau&s;e of &s;ending the Legation with convenient &s;peed, is wholly omitted, and the Sovereign is not limitted as to the Time; &s;o that the Habit and En&s;igns have happen'd to be &s;ent &s;ometimes &s;ooner, &s;ometimes later; as the Sovereign

<P>The Credential Letters are, as to particulars, drawn &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, by the <HI>Chancellor</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> and directed to the <HI>Stranger elect;</HI> but the Sub|&s;tance, in general, is, <HI>That the Sovereign having e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ected him into the Society of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> Order, <HI>hath &s;ent his Amba&s;&s;a|dors with full Power to pre&s;ent the</HI> Habit, <HI>and perform the Ceremonies due and accu&s;tomed, as if him&s;elf were pre&s;ent.</HI> And farther, to de&s;ire him, <HI>To give Credit to all that his Amba&s;&s;adors &s;hall &s;ay, or perform, on his behalf, in reference to their Commi&s;&s;ion, as he would do to him&s;elf.</HI></P>

<PB N="396" REF="406">
whence &s;ome may infer, that the Practice of tho&s;e Times was al&s;o agreeable to the afore&s;aid direction; namely, that of the <HI>Proctor</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Francis</HI> I. 19 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. where <HI>Garter</HI> &s;tood at the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e</HI> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or, with the <HI>Mantle,</HI> and as the Proceeding pa&s;&s;ed by, pre|&s;ented it to the two Senior <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> who placed it upon the <HI>Proctor's</HI> right Arm; and &s;o of the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o|ctor</HI> of <HI>Emanuel,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Phil.</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</HI> who entered not into the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> but had the <HI>Mantle</HI> di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at the Door.</P>
<P>But the&s;e In&s;tances, if duly weighed, cannot properly, or with any Advantage, be alledged to prove the A&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">on; becau&s;e the Affairs relating to both, receiv'd di&s;pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ch in the <HI>Proctors</HI> Lodging a little before, and where the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">octor</HI> him&s;elf was pre&s;ent, where the meeting of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners and Proctor cannot be deemed le&s;s than a <HI>Chapter,</HI> tho' not held in the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> from the Tran&s;actions that pa&s;&s;ed there, <HI>viz.</HI> producing the Sovereign's Warra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and the <HI>Proctor's</HI> In&s;trument of Deputation, which were both read before them by the <HI>Regi&s;ter,</HI> and the <HI>Proctor</HI> accordingly admitted, which being fini&s;hed, nothing re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a|ting to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e required their pa&s;&s;ing into the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> or remained to be done till they came into the <HI>Choir.</HI></P>
<P>But the general Practice runs &s;trong on the contrary &s;ide; for we find that the <HI>Proctor</HI> for <HI>Charles</HI> IX.

<P>Nor are the&s;e In&s;tances, and the Practice in this latter ca&s;e, really derogatory to the Statutes, which, though they prohibit the <HI>Proxies</HI> Entrance into the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> yet do not extend to any thing previous to the In&s;tallation, but what may happen after; for the Article of the <HI>Statutes</HI> having fir&s;t dire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ted the delivery of the <HI>Mantle</HI> to the <HI>Proxy,</HI> and next the a&s;&s;umption of his <HI>Principal's Stall,</HI> in the&s;e Words, <HI>Dictus Procurator In&s;tallatus,</HI> it immediately &s;ubjoins, <HI>that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">om thenceforth,</HI> that is, from the time of In&s;tallation, <HI>he &s;hall neither wear the</HI> Mantle, <HI>nor enter into the</HI> Chapter, <HI>nor have Voice there, by virtue of any Power g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">anted him.</HI> All which are Prohibitions, plainly relating to future Examples, and ari&s;ing after the Ceremonies of In|&s;tallation are pa&s;t, and not at all refering to what preceeds it.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems the Law hath been thus under&s;tood, in regard the greater prevalence of Practice hath generally attended it; for not only the <HI>Proxies</HI> of Strangers, as is ob&s;erved, but generally <HI>Knights-Subjects,</HI> have been cal|led into the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> and there received the <HI>Mantle,</HI> before they proceeded into the <HI>Choir.</HI></P>
<P>The Ceremony of delivering the <HI>Mantle</HI> to the <HI>Proctor,</HI> is performed by the Sovereign, his Deputy, or the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, <HI>Garter</HI> pre&s;enting it to them; and the manner of it was anciently, by putting it on the <HI>Proxies</HI> right Arm or Shoulder, in the Name of his Lord and Ma&s;ter, there to hold it till the End of Divine Service.</P>

Monarch, yet the Grand Fea&s;t began to decline, by a re|moval of the ob&s;ervation of St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day</HI> from <HI>Wind|&s;or,</HI> and a prorogatory Celebration of the Grand Fea&s;t to other times.</P>
<P>The Article of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> cau&s;ing this great alteration from the original de&s;ign of the fir&s;t In&s;titution, gives the Sovereign Power to prorogue the Grand Fea&s;t at his Plea|&s;ure; but then 'tis evident from the &s;ame Statute, that St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day</HI> was neverthele&s;s ordained to be duly obler|ved by it &s;elf, in what Place &s;oever the Sovereign (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h|in the Realm) &s;hould then re&s;ide; <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> hereby being not excluded.</P>
<P>It farther implies, the &s;acred <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> to be per|formed, with other Matters concerning the <HI>Order;</HI> for be|&s;ides the particulars therein enumerated, this general Clau&s;e is ob&s;ervable: That what other urgent Affair &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|ever, relating to the <HI>Order,</HI> &s;hould offer it &s;elf to be per|formed, the &s;ame might be treated of, and receive di&s;|patches, in the <HI>Chapter</HI> held where the Sovereign then &s;hould be, as fully as if he were at <HI>Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>So that henceforward, all things began to be ordered, both on the Eve the Day of St. <HI>George,</HI> and the Morrow after, with as great State; all Affairs as legally di&s;patched, and all Ceremonies as magnificently performed, except that of offering up of Atchie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ements, which is peculiar to the Chappel of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> only, as cou'd be ob&s;erved at the <HI>Grand Fe&s;tival</HI> it &s;elf.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t Solemn Action on the Entrance of the Grand Fea&s;t, which the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> are obliged to perform, is to Celebrate a <HI>Chapter,</HI> to which end it hath been mo&s;t u&s;ual for them to proceed from the Pre&s;ence Chamber, <HI>every one in their due Place and Order;</HI> fir&s;t to the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> to con&s;ult of things of cour&s;e; and next into the <HI>Choir,</HI> to hear Divine Service; which has been the con&s;tant Cu&s;tom from the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. as many Examples, recorded in the Regi&s;ters of the <HI>Order,</HI> evidence.</P>
<P>As this Cu&s;tom of holding a <HI>Chapter</HI> on the Eve of the Grand Fea&s;t, was con&s;tantly ob&s;erved when celebrated without Prorogation; &s;o al&s;o hath a <HI>Chapter</HI> been in like manner held before <HI>Ve&s;pers,</HI> on the Eve, at &s;uch time as the Fea&s;t Day of St. <HI>George</HI> only hath been ob&s;erv'd, when (for any cau&s;e) the Anniver&s;ary of the Grand Fea&s;t receiv'd Prorogation: As for In&s;tance, <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Mary,</HI> a <HI>Chapter</HI> was held at the Mannor of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, on the <HI>Vigil</HI> of St. <HI>George,</HI> before the fir&s;t <HI>Ve&s;pers;</HI> whereunto is fixt this Note, <HI>ut moris e&s;t;</HI> and the Grand Fea&s;t f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r that Year receiv'd Adjournment, until the coming of <HI>Philip,</HI> then Prince (after King) of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, though the Celebration of the Grand Fea&s;ts were removed from <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and ob&s;erved at other Places, yet this u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of holding a <HI>Chapter</HI> on the Eve, was always practi&s;ed; after which the proceeding to Evening Prayer &s;ucceeded, as is manife&s;t by &s;everal Te&s;timonies from the <HI>Regi&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>The publick proce&s;&s;ional way to the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> u&s;ed Time out of Mind, led from the Pre&s;ence Chamber through the Cloi&s;ter, and the great Gate of the King's Lodging, to the upper Ward of the Ca&s;tle, thence through the middle Ward, and part of the lower, to and through the Pa&s;&s;age, between the Ea&s;t End of the Chappel

<P>But the Sovereign hath &s;ometimes thought fit to wave this publick proce&s;&s;ional way, and pa&s;s along the private way, which leads from the King's Privy Chamber, down the Stairs into the Terrace, <HI>viz.</HI> through that &s;tately Walk lying on the North &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, and entring again at a Door, heretofore made through a part of the Ca&s;tle Wall into one of the Canons Lodgings, adjoining to <HI>Win|che&s;ter Tower,</HI> (now made up) went thence through the Cloi&s;ters, proceeding in the Order before &s;hewed.</P>

The Queen and the King's Mother rode in a Chair, covered with rich Cloth of Gold, drawn by &s;ix Cour&s;ers finely Harna&s;s'd, and twenty one Ladies, habited in Crim&s;on Velvet, rode on white Palfries: Sir <HI>Roger Cotton,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Queen's Hor&s;e, led her Hor&s;e of State, whereon was a Saddle of Cloth of Gold, and three Crowns of Silver gilt; as &s;oon as they alighted, the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> proceeded to the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> and thence to Evening Song, which ended, they return'd in the Order they came.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in the eleventh Year of his Reign, at three a Clock in the Afternoon, with all the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> in the Habit of the <HI>Order,</HI> proceeded from the Pre&s;ence Chamber in <HI>Wind&s;or-Ca&s;tle,</HI> till they came to the Quadrangle, where they took their Hor&s;es, and rode according to their Stalls, not according to their E&s;tate, next before the King, and thence rode to the middle Door of the Chappel, and there alighted, and pro|ceeded without the <HI>Choir</HI> to the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e;</HI> there are other Examples, but the&s;e may &s;uffice.</P>

<P>In what Manner and Order the Sovereign, <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> are ranked, at the holding of a <HI>Chapter,</HI> is de&s;crib'd, <HI>Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. when the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> con&s;ulted in the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> on the Reformation and Explanation of the <HI>Statutes</HI> of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>The Sovereign, on his Entrance, proceeded to the mid&s;t of the North-end of the Table; the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> who&s;e Stalls in the <HI>Choir</HI> were on the Sovereign's &s;ide, took the right Hand of the Table, and tho&s;e of the Princes &s;ide the left; then the Prelate of the <HI>Order</HI> came and &s;tood on the Sovereign's right Hand, at the corner of the Table<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">; <HI>Regi&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Garter</HI> were at the lower end, and <HI>Black-Rod</HI> kept the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e</HI> Door on the in&s;ide.

<HEAD>Tran&s;actions in the <HI>Chapter</HI> held before the <HI>Ve&s;pers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>&sect; 5. When the <HI>Chapter</HI> held before the <HI>Ve&s;pers</HI> is open|ed, and no Adjournment given thereto, all things are then to be provided for, which concern the Honour and Dignity of this mo&s;t Noble <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>The matters of cour&s;e are; fir&s;t, Swearing, and adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t|ting Officers; &s;econdly, Debating about the <HI>Knights-Com|panions</HI> then ab&s;ent, and either di&s;pen&s;ing with, or in|flicting Penalties on them; and thirdly, Con&s;tituting or appointing an Officer, to carry on the State and Solem|nity of the Fea&s;t in the Sovereign's ab&s;ence. But other Particulars that are occa&s;ional, cannot &s;o well be brought within Rule, as being wholly accidental.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> &s;oon after the <HI>Chapter</HI> is open'd, take their re&s;pective Oaths, in Order to perform the Duty of their &s;everal Places, during the Se&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> and thenceforward, as is evident from &s;everal Examples, but one may &s;uffice, from a <HI>Chapter</HI> held at <HI>Wind&s;or, Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Car.</HI> I. whereat Dr. <HI>Neal,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> was Swo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n Prelate; Sir <HI>Francis Crane,</HI> Chancellor; and Dr. <HI>Mathew Wren,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely,</HI> Re|gi&s;ter.</P>
<P>It hath &s;ometimes happened, that &s;ome of the Officers of this <HI>Order</HI> have been Sworn at other Times, as at <HI>Chapters</HI> next en&s;uing their Nomination and Choice, where|in the Admini&s;tration of the Oath is one of the fir&s;t things done.</P>
<P>Touching the &s;econd particular debated in <HI>Chapter, viz.</HI> the di&s;pen&s;ing with, or puni&s;hing ab&s;ent Knights; it is to be con&s;idered, that the <HI>Statutes</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> enjoin all the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> to be pre&s;ent at the Celebration of the Grand Fea&s;t: that is, tho&s;e that are within the Kingdom, or el&s;ewhere; although the Service of St. <HI>George,</HI> according to the Rites of the Church, be not celebrated, as on the Service of the Day whereon that of St. <HI>George</HI> has fallen, <HI>viz. Good-Friday:</HI> But with this Limitation,
<PB N="450" REF="460">
&s;o that they be in a capacity, or may conveniently repair thither.</P>
<P>Therefore the next thing u&s;ually entred upon in the <HI>Chapter,</HI> is the Sovereign's and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> ta|king notice, whether any of the Fellow&s;hip make default of coming at the Hour a&s;&s;ign'd; and if &s;o, they are con&s;idered under one of the&s;e Heads. Fir&s;t, Stranger Princes; Secondly, Late Commi&s;&s;ioners who are arrived, or every Minute expected; and Thirdly, Such as have given notice that they cannot be pre&s;ent, during the con|tinuation of the Fea&s;t: Of the&s;e Excu&s;es of cour&s;e, ver|bal Apologies, or Letters of Excu&s;e, are, or may be, of|fered; and in ca&s;e they are approved or admitted, then the Penance, which by the <HI>Statutes</HI> ought otherwi&s;e to be inflicted, is admitted; all which ought to be recor|ded.</P>
<P>Stranger Princes are excu&s;ed in cour&s;e, on Account of their nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;idence in their own Territories; and of their Excu&s;es and accu&s;tom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d Di&s;pen&s;ations, are divers In&s;tances in the Regi&s;ters of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> who are tardy in their Jour|ney, or being come to the Ca&s;tle, fall &s;hort of the Hour, or of attending the Sovereign to the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> ei|ther through negligence, or want of timely notice, or other accident; the <HI>Statutes</HI> enjoin for Penance, that they be not permitted for that time to enter into the <HI>Chapter,</HI> but tarry without the Door, and not have Voice in any thing that &s;hall happen to be done there, unle&s;s they can alledge a ju&s;t Excu&s;e, or render &s;uch a &s;ufficient cau&s;e as the So|vereign, or his Deputy, &s;hall approve of; but few defa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l|ters have been noted of this kind.</P>
<P>The third &s;ort of Delinquents, are tho&s;e <HI>Knights-Com|panions</HI> ab&s;ent, not only at the Hour of <HI>Tierce,</HI> but are likely to be &s;o during the whole Fea&s;t; the Proceedings relating to them, are either upon what is offered in Excu&s;e of their ab&s;ence, or determined on their neglect of making Apology for it.</P>
<P>Excu&s;es for ab&s;ence, are either by Letters or Word of Mouth; if by Letters, they are directed to the Chancel|lor of the <HI>Order;</HI> or el&s;e the Sovereign &s;ends to his Lieu|tenant on their behalf, and both are produc'd by the Chan|cellor: But if Excu&s;es be made by Word of Mouth, then are they delivered by the Sovereign him&s;elf; or on m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tion
<PB N="451" REF="461">
made by &s;ome of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> pre&s;ent in <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom of &s;ending Letters has been very ancient: The Lord <HI>Powis</HI>'s Letter, under his Hand and Seal, (cer|tifying his Indi&s;po&s;ition of Body,) was produc'd in <HI>Chap|ter, Anno</HI> 8 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. And the following Year the Dukes of <HI>York, Norfolk,</HI> and <HI>Buckingham,</HI> with the Earls of <HI>Sali&s;|bury, Shrewsbury,</HI> and <HI>Pembrook,</HI> Vi&s;count <HI>Bourchier,</HI> the Lord <HI>Rivers,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Fal&s;taff;</HI> being all ab&s;ent from St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Fea&s;t, they declared the rea&s;on of their ab&s;ence by their Me&s;&s;engers.</HI> There are many Precedents of this kind, and of Letters &s;ent from the Sovereign, directed to his Lieutenant, to accept of <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> Excu&s;es, who&s;e ab&s;ence he had beforehand di&s;penc'd with; we ob|&s;erve tho&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ations excus'd not the &s;ending their own particular Excu&s;es; for it is evident they were al&s;o expected, and that &s;uch allowance of ab&s;ence was not Ab&s;olute, the Clau&s;e running thus: <HI>That you [the Sove|reign's Deputy] allow the&s;e Excu&s;es &s;o far as are con&s;onant to rea&s;on.</HI> And in all other Letters of the &s;ame nature, a Clau&s;e to this Effect hath been in&s;erted: <HI>That as the So|vereign thought good to adverti&s;e his Deputy, that for certain Cau&s;es he had di&s;penc'd with their Attendance for that time; &s;o he will'd him to accept their rea&s;onable Excu&s;es in that behalf accordingly.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The ab&s;ent <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> have had their Excu&s;es frequently made by Word of Mouth, ei|ther of the Sovereign, or &s;ome other of the <HI>Knights-Com|panions,</HI> pre&s;ent in the <HI>Chapter.</HI> This Favour is done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i|ther by the Sovereign him&s;elf, if pre&s;ent; or by his Order to the Lieutenant, in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>There have been many Examples of what hath been done in this Ca&s;e, and al&s;o when the Sovereign hath not been pre&s;ent in <HI>Chapter,</HI> but hath beforehand verbally given his Deputy or Lieutenant direction to excu&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ab&s;ence of &s;everal <HI>Knights-Companions.</HI></P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve what Effect the Ex|cu&s;es have u&s;ually produc'd; whereinto we find the ju&s;t and rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">onable favourably admitted, &s;ome &s;u&s;pended<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and divers di&s;allowed.

Fourthly, Imployment in the Sovereign's Service, either Abroad or at Home; tho&s;e Abroad are nece&s;&s;arily excus'd, tho&s;e at Home we &s;hall be more particular to. The Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury, Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Eliz.</HI> was taken up in certain Af|fairs, enjoin'd him by the Sovereign; the Earl of <HI>Hun|tington,</HI> 26 <HI>Eliz.</HI> being Pre&s;ident of the Council of the North, his ab&s;ence was for that, and &s;everal Years fol|lowing favourably excus'd; and a like Ca&s;e was that of the Earl of <HI>Danby, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. who for his nece&s;&s;ary Attendance at the Seat of Ju&s;tice in <HI>Eyre,</HI> was excus'd waiting on the Sovereign at the Grand Fea&s;t that Year.

<P>And as the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> have been often ex|cus'd for not appearing on the Grand Fea&s;t, &s;o hath the Sovereign, on &s;ufficient Grounds, been pleas'd to licen&s;e and di&s;pence with their departure; from the &s;ame of this is an Example, 6 <HI>Eliz.</HI> when the Lord <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI> of <HI>Lough|borough,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">alling Ill a little before the Offering on St.

or di&s;allow of their Excu&s;es, but referr'd the con&s;i|deration to the next <HI>Chapter,</HI> to be held by Prorogation.</P>
<P>Of Excu&s;es which have not been allow'd, the mo&s;t re|markable is that of the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Scales, Anno</HI> 36 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. who were adjudg'd to the Pe|nalty of the Statute, in regard the Cau&s;es alledged to ex|cu&s;e their ab&s;ence were not approved; the latter was &s;igned by the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> in a Jewel to the value of twenty Marks, to be offered in the College; whereby the rigour of the <HI>Statutes</HI> appears to have been more &s;trictly executed on him, than the Duke, probably becau&s;e the Lord <HI>Scales</HI> was ab&s;ent the Year before, and no cau&s;e thereof &s;hewed to the <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>
<P>In relation to the Proceedings on the ab&s;ent <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> neglect of &s;ending their Excu&s;es, we &s;hall ob|&s;erve, that &s;ome of them have with difficulty been remit|ted, &s;ome left in &s;u&s;pence, and others &s;entenc'd, and re|ferr'd either to the Sovereign's plea&s;ure, or the Puni&s;h|ment a&s;&s;ign'd by Law; of the fir&s;t kind we find that the Earl of <HI>We&s;tmorland, Anno</HI> 10 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. though not very well, yet had much ado to be excus'd, becau&s;e he &s;ig|nified not the Cau&s;e of his ab&s;ence, as the <HI>Statutes</HI> requi|red.

<P>When the Alms-Knights arrive at the We&s;t-Door, they fir&s;t enter in a whole Body, while the re&s;t of the Pro|ceeding makes a &s;hort &s;tand, and pa&s;s forward near the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> where they make a joint and low Obey&s;ance; next, all turning about by the left Hand, to the Sovereign's Seat; then &s;till turning from the right, to the left Hand, they a&s;cend the <HI>Haut Pas's,</HI> even to the Rails &s;et before the <HI>Altar;</HI> and forthwith divide them|&s;elves, flanking on each &s;ide, the <HI>Juniors</HI> neare&s;t the Rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</P>

<P>Afterwards, the two <HI>Junior Knights-Companions</HI> enter, pa&s;&s;ing on till they come near their own Stalls, and there make their Reverences, and then divide, and take their &s;tands directly before their Stalls; and &s;o of the re&s;t of the <HI>Knights-Companions.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> the <HI>Black-Rod, Gar|ter,</HI> and <HI>Regi&s;ter,</HI> enter in a Brea&s;t, who, proceeding to the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> make their Obey&s;ances, and then pa&s;s to their Form, placed on the South-&s;ide of the <HI>Choir,</HI> before the Sovereign's Stall, and &s;tand before it.

<P>The <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> being all &s;eated, the Prelate and Chancellor pa&s;s into the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> and having made double Reverences, return to their Forms, and &s;it down.

<P>As to the Sovereign's other Attendants, the Noble|man who carries the Sword retires before the Sovereign's Stall, a little on the right Hand; and the Lord Cham|berlain of the Hou&s;hold, if not a Knight of the <HI>Garter,</HI> and the Vice Chamberlain, on the left, till the Sovereign give them leave to &s;it down.

<P>This being done, preparation for <HI>Ve&s;pers</HI> begin; in re|ference to which, the Prelate a&s;cends the <HI>Altar,</HI> it being the Duty of his Office, which if he omits, he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ined twenty Marks, to the u&s;e of the College, unle&s;s he give &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his ab&s;ence; in which Ca&s;e, or on the vacancy of the See of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> the Sovereign hath &s;ometimes appointed another Bi&s;hop to Officiate for him.

<P>Fir&s;t, The Serjeant of the Ve&s;try makes a double Reve|rence, then comes before the Prelate, and makes a &s;ingle one to him; who thereon ari&s;es from his Seat, and the Serjeant proceeds before him into the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> where the Prelate makes a double Reverence; and pa&s;&s;ing forward after the Serjeant, and having a&s;cended the upper|mo&s;t <HI>Haut-pas</HI> before the <HI>Altar,</HI> he makes one &s;ingle Re|verence toward the &s;ame, and &s;o goes to the North &s;ide of it.</P>
<P>After which, the two <HI>Provincial Kings, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Pur&s;uivants,</HI> leaving their fore-mentioned Stations, jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n together till they come near the Forms of the <HI>Regi&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, Garter,</HI> and <HI>Black-Rod;</HI> where, making their double R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">verences,

<P>La&s;tly, The Alms-Knights come down into the <HI>Choir</HI> in a Body, and there make their joint double Reverences, and then take their Chairs; all which being fini&s;hed, Divine Service is begun by the Prelate.</P>
<P>The like Solemnity is ob&s;erved at any other Place, as well as at <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> where, becau&s;e the Alms-Knights are ab&s;ent, the Pur&s;uivants at Arms a&s;cend nearer the <HI>High-Altar</HI> than when they are at <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> but this occa&s;ions little Variation.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Ve&s;pers</HI> are ended, the Prelate goes to the middle of the <HI>Altar,</HI> and with great Reverence makes an Obey&s;ance; and thence, with the Serjeant before him, de&s;cends to the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> where he makes his double Reverences, and &s;o returns to his Seat; where|upon all make ready to pa&s;s out of the <HI>Choir,</HI> which is performed in much the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame State, as they proceeded thither; and the Servants and Attendants of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> are mar&s;halled in the &s;ame Order as they were at the beginning of the Proceeding, that the whole Proce&s;&s;ion may again pa&s;s through them.</P>
<P>The Alms-Knights having entered the Guard Chamber, &s;pread them&s;elves on each &s;ide thereof; the Prebends pa&s;s through them, and fall off on either &s;ide the Room to the Pre&s;ence Chamber Door.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Pur&s;uivants, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Provincial Kings,</HI> proceeding through the Lane made by the Alms-Knights and Prebends, enter the Pre&s;ence Chamber, and fall off on either &s;ide toward the Stall, the King's &s;tanding upper|mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Then enter the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and place them|&s;elves on each &s;ide of the State, in &s;uch Order as they &s;at in their Stalls, the elde&s;t neare&s;t the State; but tho&s;e who&s;e Companions are ab&s;ent, &s;tand alone; after whom follow the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> di&s;po&s;ing them&s;elves con|veniently near the State.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The Sovereign pa&s;&s;es to the Step before the State, where, being arrived, he turns toward the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> who make their Reverences jointly to him, and he thereon puts off his Cap, and re-&s;alutes them;
<PB N="462" REF="472">
which done, the Sovereign and they withdraw into the Privy Chamber till Supper time.</P>
<P>But in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, when the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George</HI> was held at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> or <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and the Sovereign, as was u&s;ual with her, proceeded no farther on the Eve to <HI>Ve&s;pers,</HI> than to the great Clo&s;et, the or|dinary way, and thence &s;ent her Lieutenant into the <HI>Choir.</HI> Then, in &s;uch Ca&s;e, when <HI>Ve&s;pers</HI> were ended, the Lieu|tenant returned from the <HI>Choir,</HI> through the great Hall, and &s;o back to the &s;aid Clo&s;et, and &s;tood at the Door thereof, attending the Sovereign's coming forth; from whence they all proceeded before her into the Pre&s;ence-Chamber, and there the Ceremony, for that time, ended.</P>
<P>But in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. when the Supper on the Eve, as al&s;o the following Meals, were prepared in the Banquetting-Hou&s;e, the Sovereign's Lieutenant fre|quently returned from the Clo&s;et, by the Lobby, to the &s;aid Banquetting-Hou&s;e, in&s;tead of going to the Pre|&s;enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">; and pa&s;&s;ing up the State, gave an End to the Ce|remony till Supper time: And &s;o we find it ob&s;erved in the 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 16 of that King.</P>
<P>When the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> are retired, they are not to put off any part of their Robes till Supper is over, for that is prohibited by the <HI>Statutes,</HI> not only to tho&s;e who do not Sup, as well as tho&s;e who do. And hereon, 19 <HI>Car.</HI> II. the Sovereign having a mind to take the Air, went into <HI>Hide-Park,</HI> after he had taken leave of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> being with him, but all in full Robes, and &s;o returned to Supper.</P>

Then the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> pa&s;&s;ing up beyond them, formerly divided them&s;elves on either &s;ide, according to the Decree, 16 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and made a &s;tand, each taking Place, according to the Order of their Stalls. But at the Fea&s;t held at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> 19 <HI>Car.</HI> II. the Sovereign di|rected that they &s;hould &s;tand all on the right Hand &s;ide, facing the Table.</P>
<P>Next, the five Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> follow, who a&s;|cending beyond the <HI>Senior</HI> Knight, retire on the right Hand: After them the Sovereign, and the Officers of Arms, all doing him Reverence as he pa&s;&s;es by: Who pa&s;&s;ing up to the <HI>Haut-pas,</HI> before his own Table, turns him&s;elf to the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and putting off his Cap, they re|turn their Reverences jointly to him.</P>
<P>The Sovereign &s;itting down to Supper, is fir&s;t &s;erved by Water by &s;ome Nobleman; then Grace is &s;aid by the Prelate; then is the <HI>Senior</HI> Knight conducted to his Table by two Officers of <HI>Arms,</HI> and &s;o the re&s;t in Order, to the Tables appointed them. Whereupon the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> and of Arms, retire out of the Hall to Supper.</P>
<P>If a Lieutenant be con&s;tituted, he proceeds to Supper in full Robes, and in the &s;ame Order as doth the Sove|reign, and &s;its alone at the Sovereign's Table, yet on the left Hand of the Cloth of State, being &s;erved in all Points with Water, and by a <HI>Cup-bearer, Carver,</HI> and <HI>Sewer,</HI> as the Sovereign him&s;elf is.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="474">
When Supper is ended, and the Banquet taken away, the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> proceed back in the &s;ame Order they came to the Pre&s;ence Chamber, where the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, &s;tanding on the Step before the Cloth of State, Salutes them as before; and then appoints the Hour and Place for the <HI>Knights-Com|panions</HI> to attend him the next Morning: The like, if the Supper be provided in any other Place be&s;ides the Pre&s;ence Chamber, the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> proceed back thither, becau&s;e the Ceremony ought to end there, as has always been the Cu&s;tom. And if the Supper be prepared in the Pre&s;ence Chamber, they then take their Leave in the &s;ame Room, there being no occa&s;ion to pro|ceed farther.</P>
<P>If any of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> accompany the Sove|reign, or his Lieutenant, to his Lodgings, they then go after, not before him, in regard the State of that Night's Service ended in the Pre&s;ence Chamber; and after they have retired to their Loding, they have Permi&s;&s;ion to Unrobe.</P>
<P>When the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, do not Sup in St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Hall</HI> on the Eve of the Fea&s;t, on the follow|ing Night, the Officers of Arms have formerly had the Liberty to Eat there; and this Privilege was a&s;&s;igned them by Decree of a <HI>Chapter</HI> held 16 <HI>Eliz.</HI> appointing them <HI>that Table, which was before that time u&s;ed by the Chancellor, Regi&s;ter,</HI> and other <HI>Officers</HI> of the <HI>Order:</HI> But how they came to lo&s;e this Privilege, is not mentioned; for now, in&s;tead of &s;itting in the great Hall, they are ne|ce&s;&s;itated to Eat in &s;uch Rooms of the Ca&s;tle as they can procure.</P>

<P>When the Sovereign, having the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> before him, has entered the Pre|&s;ence, the Sword is delivered to the Nobleman appointed to bear it; and after the u&s;ual Salutations, the Proceeding &s;ets forward to the Chappel in the &s;ame Order as on the Eve; the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> having their Trains born by &s;ome of their own Gentlemen.</P>
<P>At the Foot of the Stairs, entering the Cloi&s;ter, or Stone Gallery, twelve Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber attend, with a rich Canopy of Cloth of Gold, who, when the Sovereign approa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hes, receive him under it, and bear it over his Head, till he comes to the <HI>Choir Door</HI> of St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Chappel;</HI> which Cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y is carried only on the Morn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ng of the Fea&s;t Day, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d not at any other time.</P>

it was the Cu&s;tom to hold a <HI>Chapter</HI> in the Morning of the Fea&s;t Day, either before Mattins, or after, before the Grand Proce&s;&s;ion &s;et forward.

<P>But if no <HI>Chapter</HI> be held at this time, then, as &s;oon as the Proceeding comes near the Chappel, in&s;tead of enter|ing the Pa&s;&s;age between the Ea&s;t-end of the Chappel, and King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Tomb Hou&s;e, as it does on the Eve, by rea&s;on the Sovereign goes fir&s;t to the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI> it proceeds &s;traight on to the South Door, and thence into the <HI>Choir:</HI> Yet King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in the 15 of his Reign, appointed the whole Proceeding to pa&s;s by the &s;aid South Door, all along the South &s;ide of the Chappel, and then to enter at the We&s;t Door, which was then, and &s;ince ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>When the Alms-Knights are come to the We&s;t Door of the <HI>Choir,</HI> they enter, and pa&s;s up above the Steps of the <HI>Altar,</HI> in the very &s;ame Manner and Order as they did on the Eve, and &s;o exactly of the re&s;t: Which being done, the Prelate begins the Morning Service, according to the Order ob&s;erved in the Common-Prayer, only that the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on being made proper to the Fe&s;tival, is taken out of the 44 Chapter of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus.</HI></P>

<P>&sect; 2.

<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in his Body of <HI>Statutes,</HI> alters this Article in three particulars; fir&s;t, as to the &s;etting up their Plates, which he appoints not to be after their Deaths, but within, after the In&s;tallation of every <HI>Knight-Com|panion;</HI> &s;econdly, as to the nature of the Metal, that it may be &s;uch as the Knight &s;hall plea&s;e him&s;elf: And la&s;tly, as to the &s;ize, though he al&s;o re&s;trains the <HI>Knights-Subjects</HI> to a le&s;&s;er than tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Founders; yet he gives liberty to the <HI>Knights-Strangers</HI> to u&s;e their Plates and Fa&s;hions at Plea&s;ure.

<P>Fir&s;t, That for many Years after the In&s;titution of the <HI>Order,</HI> the Plate whereon the Shield was engraved, bore no other In&s;cription, than the decea&s;ed Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ght's Name, &s;et at the Foot thereof, under the E&s;cutcheon of his Arms. Afterwards, the chief Title of Honour began to be ad|ded, though now and then, in the fir&s;t and elder times, both were omitted, as al&s;o their Cre&s;ts. But about the beginning of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Reign, not only the Knight's chief Title, but all othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Titles and Dignities, whether Honorary, or Officiary, were drawn together in one In&s;cription, concluding with that of Knight of this mo&s;t Noble <HI>Order;</HI> and which, about the &s;ame time, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> u&s;ed to in&s;ert, in all their publick and private In&s;truments of Writing; a Cu&s;tom ob&s;erved by the Knights of other Sovereigns <HI>Orders</HI> Abroad.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> gave their Paternal Coats of Arms, &s;ingly and without any Quarterings; but toward the beginning of <HI>Hen.</HI> V. they began to add their Quarterings, as appears from the E&s;cutcheons of <HI>Hugh,</HI> Lord <HI>Burnel,</HI> who died 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. Sir <HI>Lewis R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|be&s;&s;art,</HI> and others. Yet was not the &s;ame generally u&s;ed, but left to the Plea&s;ure of the <HI>Knights-Companions.</HI></P>
<P>But of later times, this very thing was thought of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uch concern, that where a Knight has been elected, who wanted Quarterings, the Sovereign has been plea&s;ed to grant him another Coat of Arms, to quarter with his Paternal Coat; that his Banner, which ought to hang over his Stall, might not &s;eem too naked.</P>
<P>Soon after King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Acce&s;&s;ion, the Knights compa&s;&s;ed their Shields with the Royal <HI>Garter,</HI> and there|on (&s;uch as were Noblemen) placed the Coronet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">elong|ing to their Dignity.

after the Offertory: But after Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had removed the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George</HI> from <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> this Solemnity was frequently di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">patched in one Day, before they went out of the <HI>Choir;</HI> and the ancient Rule, as to the time, being thus broke, was never after re&s;tored, but generally performed the very &s;ame Morning wherein the elect Knights were in&s;talled: And though the Day was thus changed, yet the Ceremony it &s;elf was not performed till after the In&s;tallation was fini&s;hed, that Solemnity having always the Precedency, till 9 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. when he ob&s;erving how incongruous it &s;eemed, to in&s;tal a new Knight before his Predece&s;&s;or had been fully di&s;charged of his Stall, gave Order for Offering the Atchievements of Sir <HI>Henry Lea,</HI> the Lord <HI>Scroop,</HI> and others, before the In&s;talment of the elect Knights.</P>
<P>Not long after, it was thought convenient to perform this Ceremony on the Eve of the Fea&s;t, pre&s;ently af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er the fir&s;t <HI>Ve&s;pers</HI> began; and next to proceed with the In|&s;tallations; whereby, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the Stalls of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> might be &s;upplied, in all the re&s;t of the Solemnities of the Fea&s;t. But if at any time, any of the new elect Knights were introduced into the <HI>Choir,</HI> before the Offering of the Atchievements began, they were appointed to &s;tand there under the Stalls de&s;igned for them till that Ceremony was fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Thus it continued from the &s;aid 9 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. till the 15 <HI>Car.</HI> II. when it was performed at the time anciently ac|cu&s;tomed for it; the Prince of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> being both in&s;talled before the fir&s;t <HI>Ve&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> began, and the Atchievements of the defunct Knights not offered till the Morrow after the Fea&s;t Day.</P>
<P><HI>As to the Manner and Order of this Ceremony, among other In&s;titutions of King</HI> Henry <HI>V. it is appointed,</HI> That as often as, through the vacancy of any Stall, the Sword<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, Helms, with the re&s;t of the defunct Knights, ought to be offered, the Sword of the decea&s;ed Knight &s;hall be fir&s;t offered, being carried up to the <HI>High Altar</HI> by two of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and afterwards the Helm, with the Cre&s;t and Mantlings, by two other <HI>Knights-Companions;</HI> and this Offering is to be made for them, in the Order they were in&s;talled, not as they died.</P>
<P>But of the Offering of a defunct Knight's Banner, we find no expre&s;s mention till 18 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. at which time
<PB N="497" REF="507">
the Banner of the Lord <HI>Brook</HI> was offered: But after|wards the direction for Offering their En&s;ign and Banner was taken into King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Body of <HI>Statutes.</HI> And &s;ince the &s;ame were introduced, according to the fore|going Precedent, it was to be offered fir&s;t, and &s;o hath been generally ob&s;erved.</P>

There are likewi&s;e many Examples where the Sovereign's Lieutenant has joined in the Ceremony to a&s;|&s;i&s;t the other Knights: Nor is a Proxy, or Deputy, to be admitted to perform any part of the Ceremony, though in the Offering of Money he ought.</P>
<P>We &s;hall next proceed to the Duties of the Prelate of the <HI>Order,</HI> the Prebends, and Officers of Arms<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> as their Services &s;everally, or jointly, relate to the performance of this Ceremony.
