<HEAD>TO
JAMES BOSWELL, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF <HI>Adam Fitzadam</HI> pre&s;umed to in&s;cribe a volume
of the WORLD to MR MOORE, I can &s;ee no rea|&s;on
why I, <HI>a Gentleman of Scotland,</HI> may not take much
the &s;ame liberty with MR BOSWELL.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, Sir, becau&s;e this addre&s;s comes
in the form of a dedication, that I have been invo|king
the godde&s;s of Flattery. Indeed I have no in|tention
to pay your compliments: not that your di&s;|cernment
is &s;o nice as to reject them with indignation;
but becau&s;e it is my &s;incere opinion that they would
do you harm. To entertain agreeable notions of one's
own character, is a great incentive to act with propri|ety
and &s;pirit. But I &s;hould be &s;orry to contribute in
any degree, to your acquiring an exce&s;s of &s;elf-&s;uffi|ciency.</P>
<P>To talk thus freely, is certainly a proof that I wi&s;h
<PB N="3" REF="3">
you well: and I make no doubt, Sir, but you con&s;i|der
me as your very good friend; although &s;ome peo|ple,
&mdash;and tho&s;e too not de&s;titute of wi&s;dom,&mdash;will
not &s;cruple to in&s;inuate the contrary.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, give me leave to thank you for
your particular kindne&s;s to me; and chiefly for the
profound re&s;pect with which you have always treated
me.</P>
<P>I own indeed, that when I have boa&s;ted of a glimp&s;e
of regard from the fine&s;t eyes, and mo&s;t amiable heart
in the world; or, to di&s;play my exten&s;ive erudition,
have quoted Greek, Latin, and French &s;entences, one
after another with a&s;toni&s;hing celerity; or have got in|to
my <HI>Old-hock humour,</HI> and fallen a-raving about prin|ces
and lords, knights and geniu&s;es, ladies of quality
and harp&s;ichords;&mdash;you, with a peculiar comic &s;mile,
have gently reminded me of the <HI>importance of a man to
him&s;elf,</HI> and &s;lily left the room, with the witty DEAN
lying open at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"><HI>P. P. clerk of this pari&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The following ODE which courts your acceptance,
is on a &s;ubject grave and &s;olemn; and therefore may
be con&s;idered by many people, as not &s;o well &s;uited to
<PB N="4" REF="4">
your volatile di&s;po&s;ition. But I, Sir, who enjoy the
plea&s;ure of your intimate acquaintance, know that
many of your hours of retirement are devoted to
thought; and that you can as &s;trongly reli&s;h the pro|ductions
of a &s;erious Mu&s;e, as the mo&s;t brilliant &s;al|lies
of &s;portive Fancy.</P>
<P>As to my merit as a poet, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that
while I am certain of YOUR approbation, I &s;hall be
entirely &s;atisfied: and if I can any how improve the
noble feelings of that hone&s;t open heart of yours, I &s;hall
reckon my&s;elf infinitely happy.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now bid you farewell, with an a&s;&s;urance,
that while you continue the man that you are, you
&s;hall ever find me, with the greate&s;t &s;incerity and af|fection,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Yours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
