<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. WILLOUGHBY was, at the age of
thirty, left a widow, with a &s;on and a
daughter, of whom &s;he was extremely fond,
and to who&s;e education &s;he entirely devoted
her&s;elf. George Willoughby, her&s;on, had
been placed at Eton by his father, but at|tended
by a private tutor, a man of &s;en&s;e
and learning, who was di&s;tantly related to
their family. When he was about thirteen,
a fever, from which he narrowly e&s;caped,
&s;o injured his con&s;titution, that his mother
was directed by his phy&s;icians to take him
to the South of Europe. Thither &s;he and
<PB N="2" REF="4">
her daughter, with Mr. Everard, accompa|nied
him. A few months completely re|&s;tored
his health; and they then went all
together to Geneva; where, after a &s;hort re|&s;idence,
&s;he left her &s;on to pur&s;ue his &s;tudies
under the care of Mr. Everard; and with
her daughter Matilda, then near eight years
old, &s;he fixed her&s;elf for &s;ome time at
Hieres, on the coa&s;t of Provence; a town
with who&s;e beauty &s;he had been much
&s;truck four or five years before, when, to
divert her concern for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;|band,
&s;he had made a tour of &s;ome months
through France and Italy.</P>
<P>Matilda was placed in a convent, for the
purpo&s;es of in&s;truction; and there &s;he be|came
the playfellow of a little girl almo&s;t
three years younger, who was known among
the Nuns by the name of <HI>la petite Cele&s;tine.</HI>
The fondne&s;s which &s;oon &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between
her and Matilda introduced her of cour&s;e to
Mrs. Willoughby, who was at fir&s;t &s;ight
charmed with her beauty, and after a few in|terviews,
&s;o delighted with her infantine ca|re&s;&s;es,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
that &s;he became as anxious to &s;ee her
every day as &s;he was to &s;ee her own child.
Her countenance, with that blooming de|licacy
which the French di&s;tingui&s;h by call|ing
it "<HI>le vrai teint Anglois,</HI>" had all that
animation which is more u&s;ually found
among the natives of the &s;outh of Europe;
yet this &s;pirited expre&s;&s;ion often melted
into &s;oftne&s;s &s;o in&s;inuating, that it was dif|ficult
to &s;ay whether pen&s;ive tenderne&s;s or
&s;parkling vivacity was the mo&s;t predomi|nant;
or whether it was the loveline&s;s of
her little form and face, or the enchant|ment
of her manners, which made her &s;o
very attractive, that the very &s;ervants who
&s;aw her with Matilda became &s;o fond of
her, as never to carry her back to the con|vent,
after a vi&s;it to their lady, but with re|luctance
and regret.</P>
<P>The Nuns, however, with whom &s;he
lived, &s;eemed, either from &s;eeing her con|&s;tantly,
or for want of ta&s;te, to be quite in|&s;en&s;ible
of perfections which won every
other heart. They treated her &s;ometimes
<PB N="4" REF="6">
with har&s;hne&s;s, and always with indiffe|rence;
&s;o that to be with Mrs. Willoughby
&s;oon became the greate&s;t happine&s;s the little
Cele&s;tina could enjoy. Mrs. Willoughby
found an equal plea&s;ure in returning her
affection; and was &s;ometimes moved even
to tears, when happening to care&s;s Matilda,
the other amiable child would approach as
if to &s;hare her tenderne&s;s, take her hand,
look innocently in her face, and &s;ay with a
&s;igh, "<HI>Helas! que n'ai je au&s;&s;i une Ma|man</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Alas! why have not I a Mama too!"</NOTE>!"</P>
<P>The&s;e artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions, and the cold|ne&s;s
with which the &s;i&s;terhood treated their
infant pen&s;ioner, rai&s;ed in Mrs. Willoughby
a great de&s;ire to know to whom the child
belonged: but every attempt to gain in|formation
was at fir&s;t repre&s;&s;ed by &s;o much
re&s;erve, that &s;he almo&s;t de&s;paired of being
gratified. At length however &s;he received
a hint, that by the &s;kilful application of
means equally potent in Courts or Con|vents,
&s;he might learn all the Nuns knew;
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and in con&s;equence of pur&s;uing this hint,
&s;he was informed, that the la&s;t Superior of
the hou&s;e, who had been dead two years,
had received Cele&s;tina into it when only a
few months old, as a child who&s;e birth it
was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to conceal:
that only the Superior her&s;elf, and her
Confe&s;&s;or, who was al&s;o dead, had ever
known to whom &s;he belonged; every trace
of which &s;ecret had by them been &s;o care|fully
obliterated, that after the decea&s;e of
both, every attempt at di&s;covery had been
ineffectual. It was believed that a con&s;i|derable
&s;um of money had been received
as the price of &s;ecre&s;y, and as a provi&s;ion
for the child; but it had never been car|ried
to account, or any part of it appro|priated
to the u&s;e of the community in ge|neral,
who now con&s;equently murmured at
the nece&s;&s;ity they were under, as they &s;aid,
<HI>par charit&eacute;, et pour l'amour de Dieu,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Through charity, and for the love of God.</NOTE> to &s;up|port
<HI>la petite Cele&s;tine</HI> for life: but they added,
that as &s;oon as &s;he was old enough to take
<PB N="6" REF="8">
the vows, &s;he mu&s;t become a Nun, and fill
one of the inferior offices of the convent,
&s;ince &s;he had no friends or money to pay
for being on a higher footing.</P>
<P>The pity excited by this account, added
to the &s;en&s;ibility with which, infant as &s;he
was, &s;he felt her own &s;ituation; her tender
attachment to her benefactre&s;s, and to Ma|tilda,
and the &s;en&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s vi&s;ible in
all &s;he &s;aid and did, procured for her, in the
tender and generous heart of Mrs. Wil|loughby,
an intere&s;t little &s;hort of what &s;he
felt for Matilda her&s;elf. Every hour in|crea&s;ed
this intere&s;t; till after a &s;tay of
eighteen months at Hieres, during which
&s;he had &s;een her almo&s;t every day, &s;he
found, in reflecting on her departure, that
&s;he &s;hould be really unhappy the re&s;t of
her life, if &s;he returned to England, and
left this amiable child to a fate &s;o melan|choly
in it&s;elf, and &s;o unworthy of the pro|mi&s;e
of perfection given by her infancy.
Having once entertained the idea of taking
her to England, it &s;oon became too plea&s;ing
<PB N="7" REF="9">
to be relinqui&s;hed. There were however
great difficulties in the way. Though the
community complained of Cele&s;tina as a
burthen to them, they made, as they de|clared,
a point of con&s;cience, not to part
with her to an heretic; and the more &s;oli|citous
Mrs. Willoughby became, the more
they declaimed again&s;t the &s;in it would be,
to hazard the &s;oul of <HI>la petite Cele&s;tine</HI> for
the &s;ake of any worldly advantage. While
the matter was yet in debate, George Wil|loughby
and Mr. Everard, who had been
&s;ent for that the whole family might return
to England together, arrived; and the lat|ter
finding how much Mrs. Willoughby
de&s;ired to become the &s;ole protectre&s;s of
the little orphan, prevailed with Father
Angelo, the pre&s;ent confe&s;&s;or, to remove
at once all the &s;cruples he had been in&s;tru|mental
in rai&s;ing: in a word, Mr. Everard
u&s;ed the argument to which Monks, in
de&s;pite of their profe&s;&s;ions of poverty, are
not more in&s;en&s;ible than the re&s;t of man|kind;
and Mrs. Willoughby having left a
<PB N="8" REF="10">
certificate of her having taken Cele&s;tina
out of the convent, a promi&s;e to educate
her without influencing her to change her
religion, and to provide for her, together
with a direction where &s;he might, in ca&s;e
of enquiry, be found, was permitted to
carry with her, from Hieres, the lovely
little French girl, who was from that hour
put on an equal footing with her own
daughter, and whom &s;he &s;eemed as ten|derly
to love.</P>
<P>After an ab&s;ence of between three and
four years, Mrs. Willoughby and her fa|mily
returned to England; where to all her
friends, who were generally &s;truck with the
beauty and elegance of her adopted child,
&s;he related, without re&s;erve, the little hi&s;tory
of their accidental attachment.</P>
<P>George Willoughby, now in his &s;even|teenth
year, was &s;ent to Cambridge: his
tutor retired to a &s;mall living, which had
fallen near his e&s;tate in the We&s;t of
England, &s;ince his ab&s;ence, and to which
his mother, as patrone&s;s in his minority,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
had pre&s;ented this excellent and amiable
man.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willoughby u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed the
winters in London; where ma&s;ters of mu|&s;ic,
drawing, dancing, and languages, at|tended
her two girls, for &s;o &s;he equally
termed Matilda and her little friend:&mdash;their
&s;ummers were divided between pub|lic
places and Al&s;tone (or Alve&s;tone, as it
was &s;pelt), an e&s;tate between Sidmouth
and Exeter, of which her hu&s;band had
been &s;o fond, that he had hurt his fortune
by the large &s;ums he had expended on its
improvement. This attachment George
&s;eemed to inherit; and in compliment to
him, his mother always pa&s;&s;ed the vaca|tions
there: Willoughby him&s;elf having
no plea&s;ure &s;o great as in talking and
thinking of the happine&s;s he &s;hould enjoy,
when he &s;hould become ma&s;ter of Al&s;tone,
and &s;ee his mother and &s;i&s;ter, of whom he
was extremely fond, &s;ettled there with him
for the greate&s;t part of every year. Mrs.
Willoughby, who&s;e love for him might
<PB N="10" REF="12">
have been &s;aid to border on weakne&s;s, if it
had been po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover any exce&s;s in
the attachment of a mother to a &s;on &s;o un|commonly
de&s;erving, had always encou|raged
the inclination he had from his in|fancy
betrayed for this his paternal &s;eat:
though his little projects often gave her
pain; for &s;he knew, what &s;he had with
more tenderne&s;s than prudence &s;tudiou&s;ly
concealed from him, that his father's
affairs were at his death &s;o much embar|ra&s;&s;ed,
as to render it doubtful whether a
minority of near thirteen years would &s;o far
clear his e&s;tates, as to enable him at the
end of that period to re&s;ide in this favourite
place, with the &s;plendour and ho&s;pitality
for which his ance&s;tors had for centuries
been eminent. The la&s;t Mr. Willoughby
had indeed continued the &s;ame line of
conduct in the country; but his manner of
living in town had been quite unlike that
of his prudent and plainer ance&s;tors; who
had but ju&s;t recovered his e&s;tate, when it
was tran&s;mitted to him, from the injuries it
<PB N="11" REF="13">
had received by their adherence to Charles
the Fir&s;t; during who&s;e unfortunate reign,
they had &s;old &s;ome part of their exten&s;ive
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and had been plundered of
more. His grandfather and great-grand|father
had nearly retrieved the whole of
the e&s;tate round Alver&s;tone, where they
piqued, them&s;elves on lo&s;ing none of the
family con&s;equence; but the manners of
the times in which he lived, and a di&s;po&s;ition
extremely gay and volatile, had led
the la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or into expences, which, if
they did not oblige him to &s;ell, had obliged
him to mortgage great part of this, as well
as all his other e&s;tates; and being charged
at his death with twelve hundred a year to
his widow, and the intere&s;t of ten thou&s;and
pounds given to his daughter, they &s;lowly
and with difficulty produced, under the ma|nagement
of very careful executors, little
more than &s;ufficient to pay &s;uch charges,
and the intere&s;t of the money for which
they were mortgaged.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
Mrs. Willoughby however was unwilling
to interrupt the felicity of her &s;on's happie&s;t
hours, by repre&s;enting to him a dreary
pro&s;pect of the future; e&s;pecially as &s;he
thought that future might, as it advanced,
become brighter; and that it was po&s;&s;ible
all his gay vi&s;ions might be realized. He
had a great uncle, far advanced in life, and
very rich, who, though the late Mr. Wil|loughby
had di&s;obliged him, might, &s;he
thought, through mere family pride, give
to the &s;on, what he had often declared the
father &s;hould never po&s;&s;e&s;s. Her brother,
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, was the la&s;t male of his
illu&s;trious race: he had only a daughter;
and an increa&s;e of his family becoming
every day more improbable, he had con|certed
with his &s;i&s;ter, even while George
(who was younger than his daughter) was
yet a child, how the family might be re|&s;tored
by a union of its two remaining
branches.</P>
<P>The good &s;en&s;e of Mrs. Willoughby
had not entirely &s;aved her from family
<PB N="13" REF="15">
pride; and this project, which the &s;ituation
of her &s;on's fortune rendered doubly de|&s;irable,
had by degrees taken &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of her mind, that nothing would have
made her more unhappy, than &s;u&s;pecting
it might not take effect. After her return
with her family from France, &s;he had an
interview with her brother, Lord Ca&s;tle|north,
who was then in England (though
his health occa&s;ioned him for the mo&s;t part
to re&s;ide abroad), and it was then agreed
with him, or rather with Lady Ca&s;tlenorth,
who&s;e will was his law, that if the young
people liked each other, of which they
hardly &s;uffered them&s;elves to doubt, the
match &s;hould take place as &s;oon as young
Willoughby became of age, who was then
to a&s;&s;ume the name of Fitz-Hayman, and
in who&s;e favour, when united with the &s;ole
heire&s;s of the family, there was little doubt
of procuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the title.
Willoughby, who was yet ignorant of this
propo&s;ed arrangement, had accompanied
his mother in her vi&s;it: but far from feel|ing
<PB N="14" REF="16">
any partiality for his cou&s;in, he had
hardly taken any notice of her, and had
pa&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e hours when common civi|lity
did not oblige him to attend the fa|mily,
in wandering with his tutor over the
exten&s;ive domain belonging to his Lord|&s;hip's
magnificent &s;eat. He &s;eemed indeed
much more &s;en&s;ible of the charms of Ca&s;tle|north,
which was the name of his uncle's
hou&s;e, from whence the title was derived,
than plea&s;ed with either its pre&s;ent or
its future po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Mr. Everard, who
anxiou&s;ly watched every emotion of his
mind, &s;aw this, and he &s;aw too that his
pupil was of a temper which would ill bear
to be dictated to in a point &s;o nearly con|nected
with his own happine&s;s. He pre|vailed
therefore, with &s;ome difficulty, on
Mrs. Willoughby, not to explain her views
till nearer the period when &s;he meant they
&s;hould be perfected; and they left Ca&s;tle|north
without Willoughby's having the
&s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of them, or carrying
away any other idea of his cou&s;in, than that
<PB N="15" REF="17">
&s;he was a tall, fat, formal brown girl, whom
he &s;oon forgot and never de&s;ired to re|member.
His uncle's complaints and
quack medicines&mdash;his long lectures on ge|nealogy
and heraldry&mdash;had tired him; and
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth's dictatorial manners of|fended
and di&s;gu&s;ted him. He told Mr.
Everard, that the only hour in which he
had felt any plea&s;ure during his abode at
their hou&s;e, was that in which his mother
fixed the time of departing for her own.
Thither he returned with redoubled de|light,
after the re&s;traint he had felt him&s;elf
under at Ca&s;tlenorth; for there lay all
his plans of future felicity, and there were
Matilda and Cele&s;tina, his two &s;i&s;ters, as he
always called them, who &s;eemed equally
dear to him.</P>
<P>In a few months he went to Cambridge;
and Mr. Everard, who afterwards &s;aw him
only for a few days in the year, had no
longer the &s;ame opportunities of judging
of his &s;entiments. He &s;till however had
intere&s;t enough with Mrs. Willoughby, to
<PB N="16" REF="18">
prevail on her to delay any intimation of
the intended alliance. Lord Ca&s;tlenorth,
his lady, and daughter, were now in Italy,
and were to remain there till within &s;ix
months of the time fixed among them&s;elves
for the marriage of the latter: but above a
twelvemonth before the arrival of the for|mer
period, Mr. Everard died. Mrs. Wil|loughby
and her family lo&s;t in him the &s;in|cere&s;t
friend and mo&s;t capable monitor: a
lo&s;s which greatly affected Willoughby, as
well as his mother, who &s;ent for her &s;on
from Cambridge on that melancholy occa|&s;ion.
Thither he had hardly returned, be|fore
the uncle of his father, on whom he
had great dependance, and who had not
long before taken him into his favour, and
promi&s;ed to make him his heir, died with|out
having altered his will, and endowed
an ho&s;pital with the e&s;tate which he had
really meant to give his nephew, had not
death overtaken him before he could con|quer
his habitual indolence, aggravated by
<PB N="17" REF="19">
the feeblene&s;s and imbecility of eighty-&s;even.</P>
<P>This di&s;appointment was &s;everely felt by
Mrs. Willoughby, who apprehended that
not only the immediate but the contingent
intere&s;t of her &s;on might be deeply affected
by it: &s;he doubted whether it would not
change the intentions of her brother in his
favor; but after &s;ome weeks of unea&s;y
&s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;he received a&s;&s;urances from
Italy that tho&s;e his intentions and wi&s;hes
were &s;till the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willoughby, though re-a&s;&s;ured in
this re&s;pect, was &s;till in very low &s;pirits,
and felt every hour, with encrea&s;ing &s;eve|rity,
the lo&s;s &s;he had &s;u&s;tained in &s;uch a
friend as Mr. Everard, whom &s;he lamented
indeed publicly, but &s;till more bitterly in
private. Her con&s;titution, naturally very
delicate, began to decline under the &s;orrow
which oppre&s;&s;ed her. Matilda, then about
&s;ixteen, was the only per&s;on about her who
&s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible of the alteration which
now made a &s;low but very evident pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="20">
in her looks and manner. Her coun|tenance
was &s;till plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting,
but very languid; her eyes had lo&s;t their
fire; and &s;he grew very thin. Her amia|ble
manners remained; but all her viva|city
in conver&s;ation was fled. She no
longer enjoyed &s;ociety, of which &s;he had
been &s;o fond: but &s;he &s;till went into com|pany,
becau&s;e Matilda, now of an age to
enter into all the gaieties of high life, did
indeed engage in them with an avidity
which her mother was too indulgent to
repre&s;s, though &s;he could not approve it.
Sometimes however &s;he &s;uffered &s;o much
from crouded rooms and late hours, that
though &s;he did not even then complain,
her phy&s;icians in&s;i&s;ted on her forbearing
&s;o continually to hazard-her health. Ma|tilda,
who was very unea&s;y if long kept
from company, was then put under the
care of &s;ome of her mother's friends, and
the ta&s;k of attending on her beloved be|nefactre&s;s
fell entirely to the lot of Cele&s;|tina,
who was never &s;o happy as when
<PB N="19" REF="21">
employed in it, and who now having ju&s;t
completed her fourteenth year, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed,
in the perfections both of per&s;on and mind,
all that Mrs. Willoughby, partial as &s;he
had always been to her, had ever &s;uppo&s;ed
&s;he would attain.</P>
<P>Above two years pa&s;&s;ed away: Wil|loughby
pur&s;uing very regularly his &s;tudies
at Cambridge; Matilda pur&s;uing as regu|larly
every amu&s;ement that offered it&s;elf;
and Cele&s;tina, carele&s;s of all that has u&s;ually
attractions for youth, devoting her whole
time and thoughts to Mrs. Willoughby,
who without &s;aying any thing of what &s;he
felt to be inevitable, was gradually &s;inking
into the grave.</P>
<P>This conviction made her determine to
di&s;clo&s;e to her &s;on, when &s;he next &s;aw
him, her purpo&s;e in regard to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman;
but it was a re&s;olution &s;he could
not bring her&s;elf to make, without infinite
regret; for in giving her rea&s;ons for wi&s;h|ing
this alliance, it was nece&s;&s;ary for her
to open to him the real &s;tate of his fortune;
<PB N="20" REF="22">
of which her tenderne&s;s, in this in&s;tance
perhaps injudicious, had hitherto kept him
in ignorance. The longer this affectionate
mother thought of the pain &s;he &s;hould
thus inflict on her &s;on, the le&s;s &s;he found
her&s;elf able to undertake it: &s;he therefore
determined that Mr. Daw&s;on, who had
been employed many years by his father
as &s;teward and manager of the e&s;tates,
&s;hould, under pretence of con&s;ulting him
on his affairs, now that he was of an age
to direct in them, di&s;clo&s;e to him their
real &s;ituation. For this purpo&s;e he went
to Cambridge; and there this unplea&s;ant
explanation was made to Willoughby: who
learned, that his father, towards the latter
end of his life, had mortgaged above a
third of his property for nearly its value;
that-what remained was not only encum|bered
by heavy debts, which were to be
di&s;charged out of it, but had a charge of
twelve hundred a year, his mother's jointure,
and was to pay his &s;i&s;ter ten thou&s;and
pounds, with intere&s;t till &s;he married&mdash;
<PB N="21" REF="23">
burthens which &s;o dimini&s;hed the income,
as to make it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave any thing
during his minority, and left him no pro&s;|pect
of ever enjoying his paternal e&s;tate
unembarra&s;&s;ed, but by an opulent mar|riage.
Though Mr. Daw&s;on had, with
as much caution and tenderne&s;s as po&s;&s;ible,
opened to Willoughby the real condition
of his affairs, the young man, of warm
pa&s;&s;ions and keen feelings, could not hear
&s;uch a mortifying account but with the
extreme&s;t pain and humiliation. Unable
to remain tranquilly at Cambridge, he
immediately &s;et out for London, and
a&s;ked of his mother a farther explanation;
as if unwilling to receive from any hand
but her's a blow &s;o cruel, which &s;eemed to
de&s;troy for ever all his favourite hopes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willoughby had ever been &s;o far
from &s;u&s;pecting that her &s;on loved money,
that a tendency to carele&s;ne&s;s in that re|&s;pect
had &s;ometimes alarmed her: &s;he was
therefore extremely &s;urprized at the eager|ne&s;s
of his enquiries, and the evident
<PB N="22" REF="24">
anxiety and concern he expre&s;&s;ed at his
di&s;appointment. But having convinced
him that all he had heard was but too true,
and recovered from the agitation into
which the nece&s;&s;ity of giving him &s;o much
pain had thrown her, &s;he &s;eized the op|portunity,
while his mind &s;eemed to turn
with unea&s;y &s;olicitude towards the means
of redeeming his patrimony, to &s;ugge&s;t to
him the plan &s;he had &s;o long con&s;idered as
infallible&mdash;"My dear George," &s;aid &s;he,
"there is one way by which all this may
be repaired; and your e&s;t&amacr;te, devolving
to you from a long line of ance&s;tors, of
whom any man might be proud, may not
only be repaired but encrea&s;ed, by an al|liance
of which an ambitious man may be
&s;till prouder. My brother, Lord Ca&s;tle|north,
is the la&s;t male of a line di&s;tingui&s;hed
&s;ince the conque&s;t; your cou&s;in, his only
daughter, will inherit his fortune; the ti|tles
die with him. It is equally natural
therefore for him and for me, to wi&s;h that
you, my &s;on, in becoming the hu&s;band
<PB N="23" REF="25">
of my niece, may po&s;&s;e&s;s the e&s;tates
and honours of my family, which on &s;uch
a union would be ea&s;ily obtained; and
that in you may be revived, or rather per|petuated,
the family of Fitz-Hayman. I
did not intend to have named this to you
till your farther acquaintance with your
cou&s;in, who returns to England in the
cour&s;e of the next &s;ummer, &s;hould have
made it on your part a mea&s;ure of incli|nation;
for from all the accounts I have
had of her, &s;he is very amiable and highly
accompli&s;hed: but my uncertain health,
and the near approach of that period when
you become ma&s;ter of your&s;elf, have at
length determined me to tell you my
thoughts in a matter, on which the pro&s;|perity
of your future life depends. I need
not &s;ay, George, that &s;eeing it in that light,
there is nothing in this world &s;o near my
heart as its completion."</P>
<P>Willoughby, who&s;e mind was contend|ing
with the various emotions this di&s;cour&s;e
of his mother's had rai&s;ed, remained &s;ilent
<PB N="24" REF="26">
and confu&s;ed. He changed colour; he
&s;ighed, as if to throw off the unexpected
pre&s;&s;ure on his heart; and Mrs. Willoughby,
who &s;aw with concern that he entered not
into the project with the alacrity &s;he had
expected, began again to de&s;cribe to him
not only the numerous advantages which
mu&s;t follow the marriage, but to repeat all
&s;he had heard, and more that &s;he had ima|gined,
of the perfections of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman.</P>
<P>Willoughby however appeared rather to
be mu&s;ing than attending to almo&s;t the
only conver&s;ation from his mother that he
had ever thought tedious. When &s;he
&s;eemed to have exhau&s;ted the &s;ubject, he
&s;till pau&s;ed a moment; then taking his
hand from his forehead, he a&s;ked his mo|ther&mdash;whether
&s;he thought Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man
as lovely as Cele&s;tina?</P>
<P>"As lovely as Cele&s;tina!" replied Mrs.
Willoughby in great and apparently pain|ful
&s;urprize&mdash;"How came Cele&s;tina to
occur to you?"</P>
<P>"Nay," an&s;wered her &s;on, attempting
<PB N="25" REF="27">
to appear indifferent&mdash;I know not how,
unle&s;s becau&s;e &s;he is the prettie&s;t young
woman I have lately &s;een."</P>
<P>"Surely you do not think of Cele&s;tina,"
rea&s;&s;umed Mrs. Willoughby with encrea&s;ed
emotion&mdash;"&s;urely you are not imprudent
enough to entertain an idea of her other|wi&s;e
than as a &s;i&s;ter. There are objections&mdash;in&s;uperable
objections. For God's &s;ake,
George, let me be a&s;&s;ured that you will
never again think of her."</P>
<P>"Dear Madam," returned Willoughby
with &s;ome quickne&s;s, "that is really more
than I can promi&s;e. How is it po&s;&s;ible for
me to a&s;&s;ure you, with any hope of my
being able to keep my word, that I will
not think of a beautiful and intere&s;ting
object, which, whenever I am with you,
is continually before my eyes."</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid his mother with yet
more chagrin, "&s;ince it is &s;o, you will
compel me to remove her where&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Surely," cried the young man, ea|gerly
interrupting her, "that would be
<PB N="26" REF="28">
very cruel&mdash;very cruel as it would affect
Cele&s;tina, and very unnece&s;&s;ary as it re|lates
to me; for I &s;hall now be very &s;eldom
at home; and I can, without any danger
of breaking my word, a&s;&s;ure you, that no|thing
will ever make your &s;on forget the
duty he owes you, or hazard giving you
pain. I am very &s;orry I named Cele&s;tina,
&s;ince you &s;eem &s;o unea&s;y at it. Think of
it no more I be&s;eech you; and continue
to love, as you u&s;ed to do, my adopted
&s;i&s;ter, or I &s;hall never forgive my&s;elf for
my inadvertence."</P>
<P>Willoughby then, without &s;taying to talk
over farther the propo&s;ed alliance with
Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, hurried away; and
that he might avoid all farther conver&s;ation
with his mother, he &s;taid out to &s;upper that
night, and immediately after breakfa&s;t the
following morning returned to Cambridge;
telling her, as he took leave, that it would
be time enough to talk over the bu&s;ine&s;s
&s;he had opened to him when the parties to
whom it related were in England, but that
<PB N="27" REF="29">
&s;he might a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf that <HI>her</HI> happine&s;s
was always nearer his heart than his own.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t time in his life that
the parted from Matilda and Cele&s;tina
without &s;aluting them both. When break|fa&s;t
was over, and he had taken leave of
his mother, he ki&s;&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter as u&s;ual,
and was approaching Cele&s;tina, who al|ready
held out her hand to him, when
catching his mother's eye, who &s;eemed to
look at him reproachingly, he blu&s;hed,
and only bowing and wi&s;hing Cele&s;tina her
health till he &s;aw her again, he ha&s;tened
to the door, and without venturing even
to look at her, as &s;he followed him thither
with his mother and &s;i&s;ter, he mounted his
hor&s;e and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Hurt cruelly at this behaviour, (which
from the very different judgment &s;he had
formed of it, had yet more alarmed his
mother,) Cele&s;tina could not repre&s;s the
tears which &s;he felt ri&s;ing to her eyes. Mrs.
Willoughby &s;tood at the door till her &s;on
turned into another &s;treet; and was then
<PB N="28" REF="30">
going to her own room, when Cele&s;tina,
from an emotion &s;he could not command,
caught her hand and bur&s;t into tears: and
for the fir&s;t time in her life, her benefac|tre&s;s,
in&s;tead of &s;oothing her, received her
mournful care&s;&s;es with repul&s;ive coldne&s;s,
and almo&s;t without &s;peaking to her left
her. Matilda was as u&s;ual engaged to a
morning concert, and had neither time nor
inclination to attend to the concern of Ce|le&s;tina
or the di&s;plea&s;ure of her mother,
which indeed &s;he either did not &s;ee, or &s;ee|ing,
reflect upon. Poor Cele&s;tina there|fore,
who never &s;u&s;pected the real &s;ource
of Willoughby's affected coldne&s;s, nor
could imagine why his mother, who al|ways
found plea&s;ure and comfort in her
company, &s;hould now fly from her, con|cluded
&s;he had offended them both, and
pa&s;&s;ed the morning in tears. At dinner,
however, Mrs. Willoughby, as if con|&s;cious
of her inju&s;tice, behaved to her with
even more than her accu&s;tomed tenderne&s;s.
After they had dined, as Matilda was &s;till
<PB N="29" REF="31">
out, their reading went on as u&s;ual. Mrs.
Willoughby took no notice of the &s;wolen
eyes and half-&s;tifled &s;obs which &s;till agitated
the gentle bo&s;om of her young friend; but
without naming the cau&s;e, &s;he &s;eemed
&s;olicitous to remove every remaining un|ea&s;ine&s;s;
and by her ea&s;y and affectionate
manner Cele&s;tina became convinced that
concern for her &s;on's departure, and not
anger towards her, had occa&s;ioned the
coldne&s;s which had &s;o much alarmed her;
and her &s;oft heart was thus re&s;tored to
tranquillity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Mrs. Willoughby took
infinite pains to appear cheerful, and to hide
the progre&s;s of the illne&s;s which was un|dermining
her con&s;titution, her efforts to
appear better than &s;he was, could not de|ceive
her phy&s;icians; who now propo&s;ed
that &s;he &s;hould go either to Li&s;bon or the
South of France. This pre&s;cription how|ever
&s;he endeavoured to evade, by a&s;&s;uring
them that travelling &s;o late in the year
would infallibly injure rather than be u&s;eful
to her; but &s;he promi&s;ed to follow their
advice early in the en&s;uing &s;pring, and to
pa&s;s the winter at Bath. Thither &s;he re|paired
in November, with her daughter
and Cele&s;tina, to remain &s;ome months.
Willoughby declined joining them at the
end of term, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom:
<PB N="31" REF="33">
he informed his mother, by letter, that he
had made a party with &s;ome of his friends
to pa&s;s the Chri&s;tmas vacation at Alve|&s;tone,
and that on their way back to Cam|bridge
they would &s;tay two or three days
at Bath.</P>
<P>Matilda in the mean time, who fre|quented
every public amu&s;ement, was be|come
a Bath beauty, followed and admired
by that de&s;cription of men who&s;e opinion
is con&s;idered as deci&s;ive in the world of
fa&s;hion. Mi&s;s Willoughby was always
mo&s;t elegantly dre&s;&s;ed; for to be &s;o was
the principal &s;tudy of her life. She was
always with people of rank, was of an ho|nourable
family, had a good fortune, great
connections, a pretty per&s;on, and was, to
u&s;e the common phra&s;e, "extremely ac|compli&s;hed;"
that is, &s;he knew &s;omething
of every thing, and talked as if &s;he knew
a great deal more. Among the men of
ton who contributed to feed her vanity and
rai&s;e her fa&s;hion, was Mr. Molyneux, the
only &s;on of an Iri&s;h Baronet, of whom the
bounty of a grandfather had made him in|dependent.
<PB N="32" REF="34">
With an hand&s;ome figure, a
good fortune, and a title in rever&s;ion, Mr.
Molyneux was every where courted and
admired; and by lounging about from
one public place to another during the
&s;ummer, and pa&s;&s;ing his winters, whether
in England or Ireland, in the very fir&s;t
world, he had acquired &s;o high a poli&s;h,
that his manners and his dre&s;s, his expre&s;|&s;ions,
and even his air, were copied by all
the ri&s;ing beaux. His under&s;tanding was
ju&s;t of that level which rendered him capa|ble
of being plea&s;ed with this &s;pecies of
fame; and having no great warmth of
heart, he had no other motive of choice
in marrying than that which aro&s;e from
his &s;olicitude to maintain his importance as
a man of ta&s;te in the fa&s;hionable world.
He had indeed no great inclination to
marry at all; but his father, now far ad|vanced
in life, pre&s;&s;ed him &s;o earne&s;tly to
take a wife, and he was &s;o be&s;ieged by the
kind entreaties of two maiden aunts who
had a great deal to give him, that tired by
<PB N="33" REF="35">
their importunity, and willing enough to
oblige them in a matter which was indif|ferent
to him&s;elf, he at length, in the
thirty-fifth year of his age, fixed on Mi&s;s
Willoughby, as a pretty woman, well
born, and above all&mdash;very much "the
rage." Propo&s;als from &s;uch a man were
of cour&s;e accepted by the mother and the
daughter; Willoughby was plea&s;ed to hear
his &s;i&s;ter was likely to be &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed;
and in a few weeks it was &s;ettled that the
wedding was to take place in February,
when Mrs. Willoughby and her family
propo&s;ed returning to London.</P>
<P>When Willoughby came with his Cam|bridge
friends to Bath, to fulfil the promi&s;e
given to his mother, he was introduced to
his future brother-in-law. But a very &s;hort
ob&s;ervation convinced him that they were
not de&s;igned for friends; and that however
clo&s;ely they might be allied, Mr. Moly|neux
would &s;till be to him a mere ac|quaintance.
Willoughby was eager in the
pur&s;uit of knowledge; his mind, already
<PB N="34" REF="36">
highly cultivated, his heart warm and open,
and his manners, with all the ingenuous
&s;implicity of youth, had the natural good
breeding which only good under&s;tanding
can give. Whatever was the real charac|ter
of Molyneux, it was no longer di&s;tin|gui&s;hable
under the poli&s;h of fa&s;hion; to
obtain which, alone, &s;eemed to be his
&s;tudy; all his ideas of good and evil, of
right or wrong, centered there. If books
had been the object, in the circle where he
moved, he would have qualified him&s;elf to
talk upon them; but as they were not, his
reading never extended beyond a &s;hort no|vel,
a pamphlet, or a new&s;paper. To
&s;trike out &s;omething new in a cape or a
carriage, &s;omething which the great would
imitate and the little wonder at, was half
the purpo&s;e of his life: to have any af|fections
was reckoned extremely vulgar;
and as he really had as few as was well po&s;|&s;ible,
it co&s;t him but little trouble to di|ve&s;t
him&s;elf of them entirely, and to obtain
that <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> which is the true criterion
<PB N="35" REF="37">
of a man of fa&s;hion. It is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to be in the Hou&s;e of Commons.
A &s;eat therefore he had for a Corni&s;h bo|rough;
where he gave a &s;ilent vote to the
Mini&s;ter for the time being, and neither
cared nor enquired whether it would bene|fit
or injure his country, about which he
was perfectly indifferent. Yet with a mind
occupied almo&s;t entirely by trifles, his hand|&s;ome
figure, and his affluent fortune and
fa&s;hionable manners, gave him that con&s;e|quence
which is often denied to virtues and
talents. His air was that of a man of rank;
and the calm coldne&s;s of his manner gave
an idea of latent powers, which he was
&s;uppo&s;ed to be too indolent to exert.</P>
<P>Matilda, in many re&s;pects, &s;eemed to be
his very counterpart. Since they had been
&s;o much together, &s;he had adopted his
thoughts and caught his phra&s;es; and her
brother, though he did not think her by
any means improved by the imitation, al|lowed,
that if &s;imilarity of character gives
happine&s;s in marriage, his &s;i&s;ter had a pro&s;|pect
<PB N="36" REF="38">
of being completely happy. But when
he looked at Cele&s;tina, which he avoided
doing as much as po&s;&s;ible, he &s;aw in her
improvements &s;o different from tho&s;e of
Matilda, that all his re&s;olutions to wean
his mind from dwelling on her perfections
faded before her. She was now in her &s;e|venteenth
year, with a face and form which
in&s;tantly attracted the eye, even before the
beauties of her under&s;tanding had time to
di&s;play them&s;elves. The&s;e latter &s;he never
obtruded on ob&s;ervation; but was as &s;ilent
in company as Matilda was talkative and gay.
The loveline&s;s of her form therefore it was
that immediately &s;truck the young compa|nions
of Willoughby; who both, the in&s;tant
they quitted the room where they had been
introduced to Mrs. Willoughby, her daugh|ter,
and Cele&s;tina, a&s;ked of Willoughby
farther particulars of his adopted &s;i&s;ter, de|claring
they had never &s;een &s;o charming a
girl, and expre&s;&s;ing their wonder at the
calmne&s;s with which he had frequently
&s;poken of her. This conver&s;ation was &s;o
<PB N="37" REF="39">
unea&s;y to him, that he could with difficulty
conceal his vexation; and as his college
friends from time to time renewed it, that
circum&s;tance, added to the pain he felt in
forcing him&s;elf to behave to Cele&s;tina with
cold and di&s;tant civility, &s;hortened his vi&s;it
to three days; at the end of which time he
took leave of his mother, who again men|tioned
to him her views in regard to Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman; to which Willoughby, who
was le&s;s than ever inclined to li&s;ten to her
on that point, returned vague but gentle
an&s;wers; e&s;caping from it as well as he
could without giving any thing like a pro|mi&s;e,
he ha&s;tened back to his books,
among which he hoped to lo&s;e the idea of
Cele&s;tina, which he could not cheri&s;h but at
the hazard of rendering either his mother
or him&s;elf unhappy.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed to attend in London his
&s;i&s;ter's wedding, which was now to take
place in a month, and for which prepara|tions
were making: but about a week be|fore
the day fixed for Mrs. Willoughby's
<PB N="38" REF="40">
departure for London, an inflammation on
her already injured lungs &s;eized her &s;o &s;ud|denly,
that there was only time to &s;end an
expre&s;s to Cambridge for her &s;on, who,
notwith&s;tanding his utmo&s;t expedition, ar|rived
hardly an hour before his excellent
parent expired.</P>
<P>As &s;he had before taken leave of her
daughter and Cele&s;tina, the greater part of
that melancholy hour was given to her &s;on,
ever the object of her tendere&s;t affections.
What pa&s;&s;ed was known only to Wil|loughby,
who, the moment his mother
was no more, gave way to &s;uch an exce&s;s
of &s;orrow, as deprived him for &s;ome hours
of his &s;en&s;es; and when they were re&s;tored,
the &s;ight of Matilda's calmne&s;s, who did
not &s;eem to him to feel half the concern
&s;he ought to do, and the perfect compo&s;ure
of Molyneux, who evidently felt nothing,
&s;eemed to him &s;o in&s;upportable, that he
&s;hut him&s;elf up in his own lodgings and
refu&s;ed every offer of con&s;olation. Though
Cele&s;tina had long apprehended that the
<PB N="39" REF="41">
life of her beloved benefactre&s;s was in a
much more precarious &s;ituation than &s;he
could her&s;elf allow, or than Matilda was
willing to &s;ee, yet this cruel and yet unex|pected
blow quite overwhelmed her: but
Willoughby, as unable to bear the &s;ight of
her grief as di&s;plea&s;ed at the &s;toical com|po&s;ure
of his &s;i&s;ter, fled with equal &s;olici|tude
from both of them; and having given
directions for removing the remains of his
mother to the family &s;eat at Alve&s;tone, he
ha&s;tened thither him&s;elf to receive and pay
them the la&s;t offices; which being done,
he wrote to his &s;i&s;ter, recommending it to
her to return to London with Cele&s;tina,
and to &s;end for an elderly maiden relation
to remain with them till her marriage,
which the death of her mother had of ne|ce&s;&s;ity
po&s;tponed: he promi&s;ed to &s;ee her
in town in the cour&s;e of a fortnight, there
to execute, as far as he could, tho&s;e parts
of his mother's will which demanded im|mediate
attention.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">
In pur&s;uance of the&s;e directions the two
young ladies &s;et out for London, Mr.
Molyneux following them in his own car|riage.
The fight of the hou&s;e which had
now lo&s;t its mi&s;tre&s;s, threw Cele&s;tina into
all tho&s;e agonies which the recollection of
pa&s;t happine&s;s and pa&s;t kindne&s;s, from a
lamented friend, gives to a heart &s;o tender
and &s;o &s;en&s;ible as her's; while Matilda,
who &s;hed a tear or two from feeling &s;ome|thing
of the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation, pre&s;ently re|covered
her&s;elf, and received her lover,
who waited upon her immediately after his
arrival, without betraying any &s;ymptoms
of emotion which could give him cau&s;e to
apprehend that the repo&s;e of his future life
might &s;uffer any interruption from the too
exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of his wife.</P>
<P>At the time he had appointed, Wil|loughby
rejoined them. Though he now
&s;aw them with le&s;s emotion, his melancholy
&s;eemed to be deeper than at fir&s;t. With
his &s;i&s;ter he avoided all conver&s;ation that
was not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; with Cele&s;|tina
he was even more re&s;erved, and never,
<PB N="41" REF="43">
as in their happier days, brought his books
and &s;at with her, or &s;ought her conver&s;a|tion
as his greate&s;t plea&s;ure. He contrived
indeed, under pretence of having affairs
to &s;ettle abroad, to &s;ee her only at dinner
or &s;upper; and frequently, under pretence
of illne&s;s, ab&s;ented him&s;elf from both.</P>
<P>After having been with them a few days,
during which this re&s;erved and altered be|haviour
almo&s;t broke the heart of Cele&s;tina,
who &s;eemed to have lo&s;t, by the death of
the mother, the friend&s;hip of the &s;on, he
&s;ent up one of the female &s;ervants to her
room, when &s;he retired thither after break|fa&s;t,
to beg to &s;peak to her in his &s;i&s;ter's
dre&s;&s;ing room. This formal me&s;&s;age, &s;o
unlike the brotherly familiarity with which
he u&s;ed to treat her, cut her to the heart,
but &s;he immediately attended the &s;ummons.</P>
<P>Willoughby bowed on her entrance.
They both fat down: Cele&s;tina trying to
check the tears &s;he found ri&s;ing to her eyes,
and the &s;ighs which &s;welled her bo&s;om.
His looks, &s;o pale, &s;o changed from what
<PB N="42" REF="44">
they were, his attitude, his &s;ilence, all con|tributed
to di&s;tre&s;s her; while he &s;eemed
collecting fortitude to go through the ta&s;k
he was to execute. After a &s;hort pau&s;e,
he took from his pocket book a paper,
opened it, and counted out three Bank
notes, of &s;ix hundred pounds each, on the
table; then advancing towards her with
them in his hand, he pre&s;ented them to
her, &s;aying in a voice which he did not
intend &s;hould faulter&mdash;"There, Madam,
is the &s;um which Mrs. Willoughby&mdash;which
my mother, by her will, bequeaths you,
and which, as her executor, I mo&s;t wil|lingly
pay you. Allow me to wi&s;h you
every happine&s;s&mdash;and&mdash;" He would
have gone on: but Cele&s;tina, who had
ari&s;en on his approaching her, turned pale
and &s;at down. "You are not well," &s;aid
he: "the recollection of my mother&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Does indeed overcome me," an&s;wered
Cele&s;tina. "<HI>I</HI> have lo&s;t a mother&mdash;and a
brother too&mdash;Yes! I have lo&s;t all!"</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">
"Pardon me, Mi&s;s de Mornay," re|plied
Willoughby, "I meant not to di&s;|tre&s;s
you&mdash;and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s de Mornay!" repeated Cele&s;tina,
again interrupting him&mdash;"<HI>Mi&s;s</HI> de Mor|nay
and <HI>Madam.</HI> Ah! Mr. Willoughby!
tho&s;e appellations of di&s;tant civility con|vince
me that I have no longer a friend&mdash;a
brother&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nay, but my dear Madam, be not,
I be&s;eech you, guilty of &s;o much inju&s;tice.
Let me execute the directions given me
by my dear decea&s;ed mother, who&s;e or|ders
you know were, that within two
months after her decea&s;e the&s;e &s;hould be
put in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion." He then again
offered the notes to her.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina put forth her trembling hand;
but in&s;tantly withdrew it.&mdash;"I cannot
take the notes indeed, Mr. Willoughby,"
&s;aid &s;he. "What can I do with them?
I, who am a minor, a &s;tranger, an or|phan;
who have no relation, no guar|dian&mdash;no
friend! I did indeed hope," con|tinued
&s;he, her eyes filling with tears from
<PB N="44" REF="46">
the recollection of her forlorn &s;ituation&mdash;"I
did indeed hope that you, Sir, would
have had the goodne&s;s to have kept it for
me till&mdash;"</P>
<P>She &s;topped from inability to proceed.
"Till when, my dear Mi&s;s De Mornay?"
cried Willoughby with eagerne&s;s he &s;eemed
endeavouring to check.&mdash;"Certainly I
would if it had been in my power; but it
was my &s;olemn promi&s;e to my mother to
pay it into your hands, or into tho&s;e of
any per&s;on whom you &s;hould appoint."</P>
<P>"And cannot I name <HI>you</HI> as being that
per&s;on?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, dear Cele&s;tina," an|&s;wered
Willoughby, &s;peaking ha&s;tily, as if
fearful of relap&s;ing into the fondne&s;s he
once felt, and de&s;irous of quitting a pain|ful
&s;ubject&mdash;"pardon me, it is not po&s;&s;ible
for me to be of that &s;ervice to you which
mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly I &s;hould rejoice to be if&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Dear Cele&s;tina!" replied &s;he. "Ah!
Willoughby! I have &s;een for many, many
months, that I am no longer your once
<PB N="45" REF="47">
dear &s;i&s;ter Cele&s;tina. Call me Madam and
Mi&s;s de Mornay, as you did ju&s;t now, ra|ther
than flatter me with the &s;ound, when
the &s;incerity of your regard is gone! Well
Sir! &s;ince, for rea&s;ons which perhaps I
ought not to penetrate, it is no longer in
<HI>your</HI> power to act by me as a brother and a
friend, I will no farther intrude on your
kindne&s;s than to beg you will tell me how
I ought to place the provi&s;ion thus made
for me by my benefactre&s;s."</P>
<P>Willoughby half &s;tifled a deep &s;igh; and
after a moment's pau&s;e &s;aid&mdash;"I would
advi&s;e you to place it immediately on go|vernment
&s;ecurity, in the names of two
per&s;ons on whom you can rely, till you
become of age. Daw&s;on, who was, you
know, always employed by my mother, is
more conver&s;ant than I am in the&s;e mat|ters.
If you will give me leave I will &s;end
him to you; and I am convinced you may
&s;afely tru&s;t to his honor and probity."</P>
<P>He then again offered the notes he had
in his hand. Cele&s;tina took them in &s;ilence,
<PB N="46" REF="48">
being in truth unable to &s;peak; and turn|ing
ha&s;tily away, he reached the door,
where he &s;topped as if irre&s;olute; then in a
low and faultering voice he &s;aid&mdash;"As I
&s;hall probably &s;ee you no more, unle&s;s in
mixed company, before I return to Cam|bridge,
I cannot take this my la&s;t leave
without a&s;&s;uring you, that however cir|cum&s;tances
may, alas! <HI>mu&s;t</HI> prevent my
&s;hewing it, my heart can never be indif|ferent
to the welfare&mdash;to the happine&s;s of
my &s;i&s;ter Cele&s;tina."</P>
<P>There was no time for the trembling
auditor to an&s;wer this addre&s;s, to reflect on
the peculiar way in which the whole was
delivered, nor on the &s;trong empha&s;is laid
on the words <HI>may</HI> and <HI>mu&s;t;</HI> for he
was in a moment at the bottom of the
&s;tairs, and Cele&s;tina, who remained in
breathle&s;s agitation, with the door of the
apartment &s;till open, heard him a moment
afterwards call to his &s;ervant for his hat,
and the door of the hou&s;e pre&s;ently &s;hut
after him. She then &s;at down and bur&s;t
<PB N="47" REF="49">
into tears, for which &s;he was, on a little
reflection, a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on even
to her&s;elf. "For what do I weep," &s;aid
&s;he&mdash;"or why am I di&s;appointed? What
did I expect? that Willoughby was at|tached
to me? Surely no! for he never
gave me any rea&s;on to imagine it, and of
late has &s;edulou&s;ly avoided me, as if he
&s;uppo&s;ed me weak and vain enough to
mi&s;interpret the friend&s;hip and regard he
u&s;ed to &s;hew me. Let me, while he does
&s;tay, convince him that he may, without
prejudice to his views in regard to Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman, &s;till treat me and con&s;ider
me as his &s;i&s;ter, and that I never thought
of being looked upon otherwi&s;e, which
&s;urely he mu&s;t have fancied, or he would
not behave to me as he does!" Another
flood of tears relieved the &s;welling heart
of Cele&s;tina after this &s;oliloquy. She then
dried her eyes, dre&s;&s;ed, and acquired &s;o
much command over her&s;elf as to meet
Willoughby at dinner without betraying
any &s;ymptoms of the unea&s;ine&s;s and morti|fication
<PB N="48" REF="50">
&s;he &s;till &s;uffered; and when the
next day he took leave of her and Matilda,
&s;he bade him adieu with the &s;ame appa|rent
calmne&s;s.</P>
<P>Three months pa&s;&s;ed, and the time fixed
for Matilda's marriage arrived. Wil|loughby
then wrote to de&s;ire his &s;i&s;ter would
excu&s;e his devoting only a &s;ingle day to
her on that occa&s;ion: he would attend
he &s;aid to give her away, but was obliged
by indi&s;pen&s;ible bu&s;ine&s;s to return imme|diately
afterwards to Cambridge. Matilda
remarked how &s;trange it was that her bro|ther,
who had now been &s;ome time of
age, was &s;o bigotted to his books that he
could not leave them for longer than a
day even on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; but his
plea&s;ures and her's differed &s;o greatly, and
their tempers and pur&s;uits were &s;o oppo&s;ite,
that no &s;ympathy had for &s;ome years ex|i&s;ted
between them; though on the part of
Willoughby there was always great affec|tion
for her; and on her's, as much regard
for her brother as it was her nature to feel
<PB N="49" REF="51">
for any body. This difference of &s;enti|ment
and inclination however had in&s;en&s;ibly
&s;o far e&s;tranged them from each other,
that the company of Willoughby was of|tener
a re&s;traint than a plea&s;ure to his &s;i&s;ter,
and therefore as &s;he felt little regret in
lo&s;ing it, &s;he thought not much about his
motives for depriving her of it.</P>
<P>The evening before that on which Ma|tilda
was by &s;pecial licence to be married
to Mr. Molyneux, her brother arrived:
but in&s;tead of the gaiety the occa&s;ion re|quired,
or even that which had formerly
been u&s;ual with him, his melancholy and
regret &s;eemed to have become habitual by
indulgence. He hardly &s;poke: and when
he did, it was with &s;uch languor that Ma|tilda
might with rea&s;on have been alarmed
for his health, if &s;he had been capable of
attending &s;eriou&s;ly to any thing but her|&s;elf.
Cele&s;tina, to whom he behaved with
more di&s;tant re&s;erve than ever, could not
be in&s;en&s;ible or &s;ilent about a health and
life which ought &s;he thought to be &s;o pre|cious
<PB N="50" REF="52">
to his &s;i&s;ter and his friends, and there|fore
&s;he &s;poke to Matilda, when they re|tired
after &s;upper, of the change &s;o evident
in her brother. Matilda an&s;wered coldly
that it was owing to nothing but his bury|ing
him&s;elf as he did among his books,
and lo&s;ing all reli&s;h for other company.
"I wi&s;h," added &s;he, "that the&s;e Fitz-Haymans
were come over, that he might
live in the world again, and be like other
people, which he mu&s;t be when he is mar|ried."
Cele&s;tina could not heartily join in
this wi&s;h, and even doubted whether Wil|loughby
ever would be quite like tho&s;e
who were called "other people" by his
&s;i&s;ter. She dropped the conver&s;ation how|ever,
and retired to her pillow with more
&s;olicitude for the happine&s;s of Matilda,
which was to be determined the next day,
than Matilda was capable of feeling for
her&s;elf. The image of Willoughby, &s;uch
as he was a few years before, was &s;trongly
painted by her imagination: &s;he ran over
all their former early plea&s;ures; their
<PB N="51" REF="53">
walks, their reading, their gardening toge|ther
at Alve&s;tone while yet children; then
Willoughby, &s;uch as he now was, &s;o amia|ble
yet &s;o changed, obtruded him&s;elf on
her mind; and being unable to look forward
with any degree of plea&s;ure, &s;he felt with
redoubled &s;orrow that tho&s;e days of inno|cent
confidence and ingenuous tenderne&s;s,
could never&mdash;never return!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the party met the next day,
every body had left off their mourning,
and every face appeared cheerful but
tho&s;e of Willoughby and Cele&s;tina: the
latter, when gaily rallied by the friends of
Mr. Molyneux, endeavoured to recover
her tranquillity; and as to Matilda her&s;elf,
&s;he gave away her hand with as much ea&s;e
as if it was a matter of cour&s;e. Molyneux
received it with equal compo&s;ure; and as
&s;oon as they were married, they &s;at out,
accompanied only by Cele&s;tina and Mr.
Hamilton, a near relation of the bride|grooms,
for an hou&s;e which Mr. Moly|neux
rented in Hamp&s;hire. Willoughby
&s;aluted his &s;i&s;ter; and as he handed her into
the coach he again wi&s;hed her happine&s;s.
It was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid doing the &s;ame
<PB N="53" REF="55">
as Cele&s;tina pa&s;&s;ed him, but he faultered,
and could hardly articulate his compli|ment,
which while he was yet tremulou&s;ly
attempting to expre&s;s, holding one of her
hands between his, Mr. Hamilton, who had
been detained by giving &s;ome orders to his
&s;ervant, came up, and taking her other
hand &s;aid&mdash;"Come, come! as you don't go
with us, Willoughby, the care of this lady
devolves upon me, and I &s;hall not allow
the&s;e &s;orrowful partings to make her as me|lancholy
as you are your&s;elf all her journey."
Cele&s;tina was then unre&s;i&s;tingly led away;
while Willoughby, who followed her to
the coach door, found at that moment his
heart a&s;&s;ailed by pangs it had never felt
before, but which he knew too well to be
jealou&s;y in its mo&s;t corro&s;ive form. As the
coach drove away, he &s;tood looking after
it; now repenting that he had not accom|panied
his &s;i&s;ter and her hu&s;band into
Hamp&s;hire, then determining to order his
hor&s;e and follow them; now dete&s;ting Ha|milton,
of whom he had never thought be|fore,
and then re&s;olving to conquer a
<PB N="54" REF="56">
pa&s;&s;ion which a thou&s;and circum&s;tances
made it the height of folly to indulge.
The coach which contained the object of
it was already out of &s;ight; but Willoughby
&s;till &s;tood on the &s;pot from whence it had
been driven, &s;o lo&s;t in the indulgence of
the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, that he forgot where he
was, and was rou&s;ed from his reverie only
by the arrival of a friend with whom he
had made an appointment to go in his
chai&s;e part of the way to Cambridge.</P>
<P>This friend he was a&s;hamed to di&s;appoint,
nor could he form any excu&s;e to account
for his &s;uddenly changing his mind and
following his &s;i&s;ter, whom he had &s;teadily
declined to accompany under pretence of
urgent engagements. While he yet de|bated,
the chai&s;e was ready, and with an
heart torn with contending pa&s;&s;ions, and a
mind intent only on Cele&s;tina and the
advantage Hamilton enjoyed of being &s;o
long with her, as during the &s;tay of Mo|lyneux
in Hamp&s;hire and in the tour they
were afterwards to make, he proceeded,
<PB N="55" REF="57">
ab&s;ent, &s;ilent, and mi&s;erable, to the end of
his journey.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina with equal oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits
was yet more unfortunate, becau&s;e &s;he was
afraid of enquiring too narrowly into the
&s;ource of her concern, nor did &s;he dare to
indulge it, but was compelled to a&s;&s;ume
cheerfulne&s;s very foreign to her feelings.
Mr. Hamilton, who had never taken much
notice of her before, now &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed
to amu&s;e him&s;elf by coquetting with her;
but &s;he had &s;o little inclination to encou|rage
him, that, as he was too perfectly a
man of the world to give him&s;elf much
trouble about any woman, he &s;oon left her
to her own amu&s;ements. In a few days
after the bride and bridegroom arrived at
their hou&s;e, it was filled with company;
and Matilda, wholly occupied with parties
all the morning, and play in the evening,
had never time to think of Cele&s;tina, who
&s;oon found her&s;elf neglected by the only
per&s;on whom &s;he could now call her
friend; and the di&s;appointment which &s;till
<PB N="56" REF="58">
&s;at &s;o heavy on her heart&mdash;the failure, as
&s;he believed, of Willoughby's regard&mdash;was
now embittered by the coldne&s;s or rather
carele&s;ne&s;s which &s;he experienced from his
&s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>In a few weeks a party was made to vi&s;it
Plymouth and the We&s;tern bathing places.
Cele&s;tina went with them as a matter of
cour&s;e, but &s;he felt her&s;elf dwindling fa&s;t
into the humiliating character of a de|pendent
companion, and &s;ometimes fancied
that her place in the coach might have
been occupied by another more to the &s;a|tisfaction
of her friend: yet Mrs. Molyneux
was never rude to her; and &s;ometimes re|lated
(with apparent kindne&s;s) how her
mother had adopted her from a convent,
and that therefore &s;he ever &s;hould con&s;ider
her as her &s;i&s;ter. Cele&s;tina always felt her|&s;elf
more mortified than gratified by the&s;e
relations; and by degrees they became &s;o
irk&s;ome to her, and the whole &s;tyle of con|ver&s;ation
among Matilda's friends &s;o little
to her ta&s;te, that &s;he in&s;en&s;ibly acquired
<PB N="57" REF="59">
an habit of ab&s;enting her&s;elf, and of living
very much alone either in her own room
or in the walks which wherever the party
fixed &s;he contrived to find, and whither
the image of Willoughby, &s;uch as it had
been at a very early period of her life
impre&s;&s;ed on her young heart, ince&s;&s;antly
accompanied her. This was more parti|cularly
the ca&s;e when in the cour&s;e of their
tour Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux undertook
to &s;hew their friends Alve&s;tone, where
Willoughby had ordered every thing to
be prepared for their reception as if he had
been him&s;elf there. Matilda re-vi&s;ited
this beautiful place with no other emotions
than tho&s;e of gratified pride; but on Cele&s;|tina
it had a very different effect: this
was the &s;cene where the happie&s;t, hours of
her life had pa&s;&s;ed. The dre&s;&s;ing room
where they all u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble when the
only parent &s;he had known was it's mi&s;tre&s;s,
brought her forcibly to the recollection of
Cele&s;tina. The chair on which &s;he u&s;ed
to &s;it, the furniture which &s;he had worked
<PB N="58" REF="60">
her&s;elf, and the pictures &s;he had collected,
were &s;o many memorials on which Cele&s;tina
could not look without recollecting a thou|&s;and
in&s;tances of her general goodne&s;s or
her particular tenderne&s;s, and feeling with
bitter regret the irreparable lo&s;s &s;he had
&s;u&s;tained. The park and the gardens too
furni&s;hed her with many &s;ources of painful
contemplation, mingled however with a
degree of melancholy &s;o &s;oothing, that
nothing would have been to her &s;o great
a puni&s;hment as being obliged to exchange
it for the de&s;ultory and unintere&s;ting con|ver&s;ation,
which, in the little time &s;pared
from the card table, engaged the party
within the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The party however troubled them&s;elves
very little with her; and &s;he was left at
liberty to retrace the walks which &s;he had
&s;o often traver&s;ed with Willoughby while
Matilda leaned on one arm and &s;he on the
other, and to gaze on the pro&s;pects which
he, while yet a boy, had pointed out to
them with &s;o much plea&s;ure. She remem|bered
<PB N="59" REF="61">
all the propo&s;ed improvements of
which he delighted to talk. A rapid &s;tream
bur&s;ting from the hollow of a rocky com|mon
that bounded the park, and made its
way through it, had been by the former
Mr. Willoughby widened at a great ex|pence,
and now fell &s;everal feet into a vale
which he had at a &s;till greater co&s;t, floated
with water. On the &s;ides of this fall, which
had been formerly part of the common,
grew &s;ome old oaks and beech, and among
the&s;e the mountain a&s;h and weeping birch
had been planted and now &s;pread their
various foliage and half concealed the wa|ter
that da&s;hed from rock to rock between
them. The&s;e &s;teep banks had ever been
the favourite &s;eats of Willoughby; who
there &s;itting between his two &s;i&s;ters, and
holding each of their hands, had very fre|quently
amu&s;ed him&s;elf with projects to
encrea&s;e the roar of the water or deepen
the &s;hade of the wood that fringed it's &s;ide.
This place was the daily re&s;ort of Cele&s;tina
during the week &s;he remained at Alve&s;tone
<PB N="60" REF="62">
and thither &s;he u&s;ually carried &s;ome of
tho&s;e books from the library that &s;he re|membered
Willoughby had read to her.
The&s;e were principally poetry: and the re|peru&s;al
of them, the place, the &s;ea&s;on, a
thou&s;and tender remembrances enforced
by each, &s;erved at once to &s;often and de|pre&s;s
an heart naturally tender and affec|tionate,
which, deprived of almo&s;t every
other object of it's regard, cheri&s;hed with
painful plea&s;ure the idea of Willoughby,
&s;uch as he once was, and when they pa&s;&s;ed
here &s;o many innocent enchanting hours.
But when &s;he imagined that in a few months
he would probably re-vi&s;it the&s;e &s;cenes
with another, with Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
who would then be his wife, and that &s;he
her&s;elf &s;hould never again be admitted to
wander among them with their beloved
ma&s;ter, &s;ick de&s;pondence took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of her &s;oul, and it was with difficulty after
the&s;e reflections that &s;he could rea&s;&s;ume
courage enough to mix with the friends
whom Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux had a&s;&s;em|bled
<PB N="61" REF="63">
to li&s;ten to in&s;ipid plea&s;antry and at|tend
to unintere&s;ting conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But whatever regret Cele&s;tina felt in re|collecting
pa&s;t hours of felicity which &s;he
knew could never return, &s;he left Alve|&s;tone
with extreme reluctance, and had it
been proper, or po&s;&s;ible, would mo&s;t wil|lingly
have remained there alone. In
quitting it never to return, &s;he felt almo&s;t as
much concern as &s;he had done when in
taking leave of Willoughby &s;he fancied
that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him no more till he was
married to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman.</P>
<P>Of that match Mrs. Molyneux now
very frequently &s;poke as a matter entirely
&s;ettled, and Cele&s;tina no longer doubted
of it's &s;peedy completion. This circum|&s;tance,
(which gave her unea&s;ine&s;s that &s;he
was unable either to repre&s;s or entirely to
di&s;gui&s;e), the encrea&s;ing indifference of
Matilda towards her, and the con&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of company in which Mr. and Mrs.
Molyneux lived, united to rai&s;e in her a
wi&s;h to quit them; and finding that the
<PB N="62" REF="64">
hints &s;he gave of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition were
received with perfect carele&s;ne&s;s, and that
&s;uch a removal would probably not be
objected to, &s;he every day grew fonder of
her project, and during their &s;tay at Sid|mouth
fixed on a cottage about four miles
from it, where &s;he thought &s;he might re|&s;ide,
if not happily at lea&s;t in that quiet
ob&s;curity which her circum&s;tances rendered
prudent, and her di&s;ta&s;te to the world in
which &s;he now lived, plea&s;ant. She found
that &s;he could there be accommodated
with board and lodging, and there &s;he
would now have remained if Mrs. Moly|neux
had not, when &s;he under&s;tood her
project, in&s;i&s;ted on her returning to Lon|don
with her after fini&s;hing their tour.&mdash;"Go
with me however," &s;aid &s;he, "the
re&s;t of our journey, and till we meet the
Ca&s;tlenorths, who are to be in town in
October; and then if you have this rural
pa&s;&s;ion &s;till &s;o &s;trong upon you, you &s;hall
take your own way." Though there was
little appearance of affection in this invi|tation,
<PB N="63" REF="65">
Cele&s;tina thought &s;he ought not to
decline it, and therefore, though meeting
the Ca&s;tlenorths was what &s;he mo&s;t &s;oli|citou&s;ly
wi&s;hed to avoid, &s;he determined
to go with her friend to town, that &s;he
might not give her any pretence for for|getting
her entirely, or incur the cen&s;ure
of the world for leaving abruptly the only
protection &s;he could claim.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE return of Mr. and Mrs. Moly|neux
to London was po&s;tponed from time
to time till November. Lord Ca&s;tlenorth
had been too ill to &s;et out on his journey to
England at the time he propo&s;ed, and the
family meeting which was to &s;ettle all that
related to the marriage was now delayed
till after Chri&s;tmas. Willoughby however
te&s;tified no impatience: he had promi&s;ed
to meet his &s;i&s;ter and her hu&s;band in town
on their arrival; but in&s;tead of doing &s;o,
he &s;ent &s;uch an in&s;ufficient excu&s;e as mu&s;t
have appeared very &s;trange to Matilda
had &s;he thought much about it; but im|mer&s;ed
in plea&s;ures and pur&s;uits of her
own, &s;he gave her&s;elf very little time to re|flect
on her brother's conduct, and was
far from &s;uppo&s;ing that he ab&s;ented him|&s;elf
<PB N="65" REF="67">
becau&s;e he could not &s;ee Cele&s;tina
without encrea&s;ing and confirming a pa&s;|&s;ion
which he had many rea&s;ons again&s;t
indulging, and of which he was determined
to cure him&s;elf by ab&s;ence and reflection.
The negociation with his uncle, which
had been carried &s;o far by his mother, he
neither declined nor forwarded; but &s;uf|fered
it to remain nearly on the footing &s;he
had left it, flattering him&s;elf that by the
time Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman arrived in London,
he &s;hould have &s;o far conquered his early
attachment as to have an heart as well as
the hand, which he had promi&s;ed to his
mother's entreaties, to offer her.</P>
<P>Though his endeavours to forget Cele&s;|tina
had hitherto been quite un&s;ucce&s;sful,
he had however acquired &s;o much re&s;olu|tion
as to determine not to &s;ee her, till the
arrival of his de&s;tined wife, and the final
&s;ettlement of every thing that related to
his marriage, &s;hould put it out of his power
to break the engagement he had made to
Mrs. Willoughby in her la&s;t hours, and to
&s;acrifice every thing to his pa&s;&s;ion. The
<PB N="66" REF="68">
&s;truggle he underwent however was dread|ful,
and by continually repeating to him|&s;elf
the nece&s;&s;ity there was for his forgetting
Cele&s;tina, he &s;o accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to
think of her, that he in reality &s;oon cea&s;ed
to think with intere&s;t of any body el&s;e;
and though he endeavoured to per&s;uade
him&s;elf that he &s;hould have courage to
acquit him&s;elf of what he tried to think his
duty to his family, to his mother's me|mory,
and him&s;elf, there was no intelligence
he &s;o much dreaded as that of the arrival
of his uncle's family in England.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina on her part, pa&s;&s;ed her time in
a way very unplea&s;ant to her. Mrs. Moly|neux,
now mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf, plunged
into uncea&s;ing di&s;&s;ipation; and as Cele&s;tina
was frequently de&s;ired to accompany her,
and always to make one of the parties &s;he
collected at her own hou&s;e, &s;he found that
the expences of dre&s;s alone would greatly
exceed the income of her little fortune,
and that &s;he &s;hould &s;oon exhau&s;t it to live
among people who&s;e &s;ociety gave her no
<PB N="67" REF="69">
plea&s;ure, and who for the mo&s;t part con&s;i|dered
her only as &s;he was capable of filling
up a table or the corner of a coach when
it was vacant. Her quickne&s;s of appre|hen&s;ion
and extreme &s;en&s;ibility made her
too frequently remark, that the table or the
coach might in the apprehen&s;ion of Matilda
always be as well, and &s;ometimes better
filled; and the&s;e ob&s;ervations, together
with her growing di&s;like to Mr. Molyneux,
and the people with whom he a&s;&s;ociated,
who not unfrequently treated her with the
impertinent familiarity which they thought
them&s;elves at liberty to u&s;e towards Mrs.
Molyneux's <HI>companion,</HI> renewed, before &s;he
had been &s;ix weeks in town, her wi&s;h to
quit them for ever, and to enjoy in her
own way the &s;mall independence given her
by her lamented benefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>The certainty that Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
was &s;o &s;oon to become the wife of the only
man for whom &s;he ever had felt the lea&s;t
degree of partiality, ha&s;tened the execution
of her project. She now heard every day
<PB N="68" REF="70">
of the great beauty, the extraordinary ac|compli&s;hments,
and the immen&s;e fortune
of the future bride, while Mrs. Molyneux
was exerci&s;ing her fancy on the equipages,
and other preparations which were &s;o &s;oon
to be on foot for the wedding of her bro|ther;
a &s;ubject that Cele&s;tina always li&s;tened
to with impatience, which, though &s;he with
difficulty concealed it from others, &s;he was
painfully con&s;cious of her&s;elf. The eter|nal
harangues of Mrs. Molyneux on ta&s;te
and elegance had always been fatiguing to
her, but &s;he was more than u&s;ually di&s;|gu&s;ted
when the purpo&s;e of the&s;e lectures
was to decide upon or to de&s;cribe the bri|dal
fineries intended for Willoughby and
Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman.</P>
<P>A letter now arrived from Lady Ca&s;tle-north
announcing her intentions of being
in London with her Lord and her daughter
the following week; and at this intelli|gence
Cele&s;tina, no longer he&s;itating, wrote
to the per&s;on near Sidmouth, to whom &s;he
had &s;poken the preceding &s;ummer; and
<PB N="69" REF="71">
finding &s;he could be immediately received
at the lodging &s;he had then looked at,
&s;he packed up and &s;ent by the waggon
the &s;mall collection of books given her
by Mrs. Willoughby, which with her
cloaths and the legacy ve&s;ted in the funds,
were all her worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and that
evening after &s;upper, when by a chance
very unu&s;ual with them Mr. and Mrs. Mo|lyneux
were without company, &s;he declared
her intentions of going into the country
the next day.</P>
<P>Mr. Molyneux, twirling about a wine
gla&s;s and humming a tune, &s;eemed to at|tend
very little to the information; his
wife, after hearing it with almo&s;t equal in|difference,
&s;aid&mdash;"I cannot imagine, my
dear, why you think of going into the
country now, or what you propo&s;e by it."</P>
<P>"Nothing more," replied Cele&s;tina,
piqued at the coldne&s;s of her manner,
"than to accu&s;tom my&s;elf at once to a
mode of life which my narrow fortune ren|ders,
<PB N="70" REF="72">
if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, at lea&s;t
highly prudent."</P>
<P>"Prudence," cried Molyneux with a
&s;mile which Cele&s;tina thought a contemptu|ous
one, "is an acqui&s;ition very unu&s;ual
at eighteen: but a girl of &s;pirit, with &s;o
pretty a per&s;on as your's is, &s;hould be ra|ther
ambitious than prudent, and &s;hould
try to make her fortune by marriage in&s;tead
of hiding her&s;elf in the country. Num|berle&s;s
young women about town have
done extremely well, who, without any com|pliment,
have not had your &s;hare of beauty."</P>
<P>"Very po&s;&s;ibly, Sir," replied Cele&s;tina;
"but unle&s;s my mind was di&s;po&s;ed as
their minds probably were, which I believe
it never will be, the per&s;onal advantages
you &s;o flatteringly allow me, will never ob|tain
the affluence you think &s;o de&s;irable."</P>
<P>"What do you mean to &s;ay?" an&s;wered
he. "What! do you pretend that you
would not marry as other women do for
money or title?"</P>
<P>"For neither, upon my honor."</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73">
"Pooh! I thought you had more &s;en&s;e;
but &s;ince it is &s;o, my dear Cele&s;tina, I wi&s;h
you all po&s;&s;ible felicity in your new plan
of pa&s;toral amu&s;ement, and doubt not but
that &s;ome tender and amiable Philander, in
the &s;hape of a young we&s;t country curate,
will enable you to realize to your heart's
content all your ideas of di&s;intere&s;ted love
and rural happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Molyneux then &s;auntered away, and his
lady looking in a pocket mirror, and pick|ing
her teeth with the nice&s;t care, took up
the argument.</P>
<P>"You know Cele&s;tina that I have the
greate&s;t regard in the world for you, and
that I have argued with you for ever about
this non&s;en&s;ical re&s;olution, which I cannot
imagine what put into your head. You
will be tired to death child, in the country
at this time of the year. However if you
will go, do &s;tay here at lea&s;t till after my
brother is married. We &s;hall have half the
world with us then, and I &s;hall want you
for twenty things."</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">
At the mention of Willoughby's mar|riage,
Cele&s;tina, though &s;o much accu&s;tomed
to hear of it, changed colour, and her
voice as well as her look might have be|trayed
the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations &s;he felt, if
Mrs. Molyneux had not been always too
much occupied by her&s;elf to attend very
narrowly to another.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, dear Madam," &s;aid Ce|le&s;tina,
"I certainly cannot be wanted on
that occa&s;ion. You will have &s;o many
other friends about you that I &s;hall not be
mi&s;&s;ed; and I have no right, indeed I
never had any, to be upon an equality with
the per&s;ons who will then be a&s;&s;embled
about you. Let me therefore find my
own place in &s;ociety, and learn at once to
&s;ubmit to it."</P>
<P>After &s;ome other conver&s;ation, Cele&s;tina,
&s;till unwilling to appear in the &s;lighte&s;t de|gree
ungrateful for pa&s;t kindne&s;s or too
impatient of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, agreed
to &s;tay another week in town; and retired
to her own room relieved by having thus
<PB N="73" REF="75">
declared her intentions, and fixed the time
when her pre&s;ent unea&s;y &s;tate of depend|ance
would be at an end.</P>
<P>But of this delay &s;he repented, when the
next day notice was received by Mrs. Mo|lyneux
of the arrival of Lord and Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth at their hou&s;e in Gro&s;venor|&s;treet.
Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux in&s;tantly
waited on them; the next evening they
were to return the vi&s;it in form; and
thus Cele&s;tina was compelled to be pre&s;ent
at a meeting &s;he had been &s;tudiou&s;ly endea|vouring
to avoid.</P>
<P>Lord Ca&s;tlenorth was one of tho&s;e un|fortunate
beings, who have been brought
up never to have a wi&s;h unprevented or a
want ungratified. He was born when his
father was far advanced in life, the &s;ole
heir to one of the mo&s;t ancient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Hayman, Earl of Gloce&s;ter, came in with
the Conqueror, the heire&s;s of which family married
a natural &s;on of Henry I. by Ne&s;la, daughter of
Rhees Prince of South Wales.</NOTE> families
and opulent fortunes in England; and was
<PB N="74" REF="76">
of &s;o much con&s;equence, that till he was
near eighteen he was hardly ever &s;uffered
out of the &s;ight of his father. He was
then relea&s;ed by death from the officious
affection which had long been very trou|ble&s;ome
to him; and with every thing on
his &s;ide but a good con&s;titution, he &s;at
out on a wild career of plea&s;ure, in which,
before he had materially hurt his fortune,
he was &s;topped by the apprehen&s;ion of de|clining
health. His figure was one of tho&s;e
which look as if
<Q>The bla&s;ts of January would blow them thro'
and thro';</Q>
and the irregularities of his life had &s;o
much impaired a habit naturally weak,
that at thirty he was a mere &s;hadow, and
then was told by his phy&s;icians that he
mu&s;t re&s;olve on a re&s;idence of &s;ome time
in the South of Europe if he would avoid
going to that country "from who&s;e bourn
no traveller returns:" to which having
an invincible aver&s;ion, he lo&s;t not a mo|ment
<PB N="75" REF="77">
in complying with their advice. But
as he &s;oon recovered &s;ome degree of health,
he grew every day le&s;s attentive to injunc|tions
they had given as to his manner
of life; and relap&s;ing into his former
indi&s;cretions, he was again reduced to ex|tremities,
and when very little hope of his
life remained, was recommended by one of
his medical friends in London to put him|&s;elf
under the care of Dr. Maclaurin, a
Scotti&s;h phy&s;ician, who had been &s;ettled for
two or three years at Naples with his wife
and family.</P>
<P>There he was treated with the mo&s;t a&s;&s;i|duous
attention, not only by the Doctor
him&s;elf but by Mrs. Maclaurin and her
daughter, then near thirty, who was &s;o rea|&s;onable
as to allow her&s;elf to be five and
twenty. She was tall, and had a tolerable
face, with which her ambition to be ad|mired,
&s;uffered her not to be content in it's
natural &s;tate. She had been brought up
to attend mo&s;t &s;edulou&s;ly to her own inte|re&s;t,
and to pur&s;ue the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her
<PB N="76" REF="78">
fortune by marriage: &s;he had therefore
learned early to fawn and flatter; and to
the cunning of her mother united &s;ome
portion of the abilities of her father. Mrs.
Maclaurin was one of that &s;pecies of beings
who are by courte&s;y denominated good
&s;ort of women. All her virtues were ne|gative;
and of the few vices &s;he had it in
her power to practi&s;e, &s;he contented her|&s;elf
with malice and defamation, and even
in tho&s;e &s;he never indulged her&s;elf unle&s;s
very certain that the objects were incapable
of retort and totally defencele&s;s. She had
now however but little opportunity of gra|tification;
for though &s;he had lived three
years in Italy, &s;he under&s;tood not a word
of the language, and her attempts to amend
the world being therefore made, in one not
under&s;tood by tho&s;e in who&s;e favor they
were exerted, were very little compre|hended,
and of cour&s;e failed of affording
her much &s;atisfaction. Her talents being
thus perforce confined to her own hou&s;hold,
had taken another turn, and had been ap|plied
<PB N="77" REF="79">
to the acqui&s;ition of money, and of
&s;ecuring a good match for her daughter.</P>
<P>The Doctor, though really a man of
&s;ome abilities, had not hitherto been &s;uc|ce&s;sful
enough in his profe&s;&s;ion to be ena|bled
to give her a fortune: the project of
marrying her well was equally intere&s;ting
to him; and among the various patients
he had received into his hou&s;e &s;ince he re|&s;ided
at Naples, the elder &s;on of a very
opulent merchant in London, and an old
Baronet, who had &s;everal daughters older
than Mi&s;s Maclaurin, very narrowly e&s;caped
her multiform attractions by the impertinent
remon&s;trances of their families.</P>
<P>Lord Ca&s;tlenorth had no relations but
Mrs. Willoughby, who was very unlikely
to interfere in any matrimonial project; he
had be&s;ides a much larger fortune, and was
of a much higher rank, than any of tho&s;e
for whom the family of Maclaurin had in|tended
the honor of their alliance; but the
very circum&s;tances which rendered the pro&s;|pect
of &s;uch a marriage mo&s;t alluring,
<PB N="78" REF="80">
&s;eemed to preclude the probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>Among the few things Lord Ca&s;tlenorth
had learned of his father, the principal was
to value him&s;elf on his de&s;cent; and, as
far as related to his own family, he was a
genealogi&s;t almo&s;t as &s;oon as he could &s;peak.
As he advanced in life, he found him&s;elf
of &s;o little con&s;equence for individual me|rit,
that he was compelled to avail him&s;elf
of the names of his ance&s;tors, from whom
only he derived any importance at all;
and the "puny in&s;ect &s;hivering at a breeze,"
&s;welled with con&s;cious pride when he recited
the names of heroes from whom he had &s;o
woefully degenerated.</P>
<P>This pride of ance&s;try was now the mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hing feature in a character where
it appeared with the greate&s;t prominence,
from the faintne&s;s and in&s;ipidity of the
other traits, for being no longer able to
pur&s;ue the di&s;&s;olute manner of life which
he had adopted rather from fa&s;hion than in|clination,
<PB N="79" REF="81">
he had now in other re&s;pects no
character at all.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Maclaurin, who began to &s;tudy
him as &s;oon as he was received by her fa|ther,
&s;oon &s;aw it, and &s;aw it with di&s;may;
for &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that it would be an in&s;u|perable
bar to tho&s;e hopes, which &s;he
thought &s;he might otherwi&s;e very rea&s;onably
entertain.</P>
<P>The Doctor however had too many re|&s;ources
to be &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;couraged. He
fabricated with admirable ingenuity a &s;tory,
of which he ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed the ignorance
and indolence of his patient would prevent
his ever detecting the fal&s;ehood. He &s;aid
that he was really a Hamilton, and had
taken his pre&s;ent name in compliance with
the whim of a di&s;tant relation, who had on
that condition given him his property.
The only objection being thus removed,
Mi&s;s Maclaurin had a fair field for her at|tractive
talents; and they were &s;o effectually
exerted, that in about five months after
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth's reception into the family
<PB N="80" REF="82">
of Maclaurin, he became him&s;elf a member
of it, and Mi&s;s Maclaurin returned to Eng|land
as his wife.</P>
<P>That her father might &s;till retain, with|out
too &s;crupulous an enquiry, his relation|&s;hip
to the hou&s;e of Hamilton, and that
her mother's coar&s;e figure and coar&s;er man|ners
might be no di&s;grace to Lady Ca&s;tle|north
in the &s;phere where &s;he now prepared
to blaze, &s;he prevailed upon them to retire
to their native country on a pen&s;ion which
there gave them con&s;equence: while her
Lady&s;hip, who while &s;he was Mi&s;s Mac|laurin
had nothing doubted of her own
eminent perfections, was now &s;o convinced
of their irre&s;i&s;tible power by their having
thus e&s;tabli&s;hed her in a &s;ituation &s;o much
above her hopes, that &s;he thought her&s;elf
born for the government and amendment
of the world, and from that period had
been advancing inarrogance and o&s;tentation
till the pre&s;ent hour; when at the age of
fifty, with an unweildy per&s;on and a broad
face, where high cheek bones appeared
<PB N="81" REF="83">
emulous of giving &s;ome protection to two
grey prominent eyes, who&s;e lids &s;eemed
inadequate to &s;hade them, Lady Ca&s;tle|north
was as well by her rank as her ta|lents
and her travels, qualified in her own
opinion for univer&s;al dominion. Not con|tent
therefore with governing her Lord
with de&s;potic &s;way, (which indeed &s;aved
him the trouble and probably the di&s;grace
of governing him&s;elf) &s;he a&s;&s;umed towards
the re&s;t of the world a &s;tyle equally dicta|torial.
Her opinion was &s;trongly enforced
on every topic that came before her; in
private anecdote, in public debates, in
literature, in politics, in fa&s;hions, &s;he was
equally omni&s;cient; and whether the con|ver&s;ation
ran on taxes or on ta&s;te, in laying
out grounds or on &s;etting out a dinner, in
making a peace or a poem, &s;he under&s;tood
all, de&s;canted on all, and could decide
on all, in a way from which few of her
auditors had at the moment courage to ap|peal.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84">
By the &s;ide of this maje&s;tic figure, her
Lord, the de&s;cendant of the old Earls of
Glouce&s;ter, of Wel&s;h Princes and Engli&s;h
Kings, &s;unk into in&s;ignificance. His di|minutive
figure, now &s;hrunk by age and
&s;ickne&s;s, his &s;allow and withered counte|nance,
and his feeble &s;tep, formed a de|cided
contra&s;t to his robu&s;t and Juno-like
lady, by whom he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be
led about, without ever pretending to di&s;|&s;ent
from her opinion, unle&s;s in matters of
heraldry or genealogy, where he &s;till ven|tured
to take the lead, in which &s;he was
for the mo&s;t part willing to indulge him.
His Lord&s;hip's ill health had made him
al&s;o conver&s;ant in phy&s;ic; a &s;cience in
which, notwith&s;tanding her hereditary claim
to it, Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had not &s;hewn much
di&s;po&s;ition to contend with him: but as
there was more trouble and di&s;gu&s;t than
honour to be obtained by a con&s;tant atten|tion
to it, as applied to his real or ima|ginary
complaints, &s;he had very frequently
delegated her authority, and at length
quite relinqui&s;hed her knowledge, to a
<PB N="83" REF="85">
relation, who being a widow (and &s;aid to
po&s;&s;e&s;s a pretty fortune though nobody ever
knew where it lay) now about &s;ix and forty,
had with infinite philanthropy dedicated
her days to relieve the infirmities of her
fellow creatures without any other advan|tage
than that of being received in turn
at their hou&s;es. She knew every receipt,
whether of diet or medicine, that could be
named, as preventative or cure; under&s;tood
the preparation of every quack remedy,
and the qualities of all the drugs of which
they are compounded: nor was &s;he le&s;s
acquainted with the human frame; and
would in all companies give the hi&s;tory of
any complaint to which it is &s;ubject in
technical terms, to the wonder of &s;ome
and the terror of many hearers. Such were
the manners of Mrs. Calder; and her per|&s;on
was one of tho&s;e, which but for their
&s;ingularity, nobody would ever recollect
as having &s;een at all. She now re&s;ided
almo&s;t con&s;tantly with Lord and Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth, to both of whom &s;he had con|trived
<PB N="84" REF="86">
to render her&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary. With
them &s;he had been abroad, (where &s;he had
greatly improved her &s;tock of knowledge,
and had actually written a treati&s;e on the
goitres of the Alpine pea&s;ants, which Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth was poli&s;hing for publication,)
and &s;he was now of the party who were
a&s;&s;embled at Mrs. Molyneux's; where the
la&s;t but not the lea&s;t in con&s;equence ap|peared
al&s;o&mdash;the de&s;tined bride of Wil|loughby.</P>
<P>The claim of this young lady to eminent
beauty, or to any thing more than a barely
tolerable per&s;on, would certainly not have
been allowed, had &s;he not been heire&s;s to
the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Fitz-Hayman; but
the e&s;cutcheon of pretence, which &s;he had a
right to, &s;eemed to give her a pretence al&s;o,
to much of what nature had very &s;cantily
allowed her. She was as tall and almo&s;t
as large as her mother, whom &s;he greatly
re&s;embled. Her complexion was brown,
and as her hair was not dark, the want of
contra&s;t produced a muddy and heavy
<PB N="85" REF="87">
effect, which nothing could have relieved
but two dark eyes, who&s;e powers were
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a greater quantity of rouge than
unmarried ladies are even by the French
cu&s;toms u&s;ually allowed. What expre&s;&s;ion
they naturally had however was not plea&s;|ing,
and what they borrowed from this ad|dition
added more to their fiercene&s;s than
their lu&s;tre. They were eyes of "high
claims and expectations," which demanded
rather than &s;olicited admiration, and &s;igni|fied
pretty plainly the real di&s;po&s;ition of a
character, inflated with ideas of it's own con|&s;equence,
and con&s;idering more than half
the world as beings of another &s;pecies,
who&s;e evils &s;he could not feel for, becau&s;e
&s;he was placed where it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he
could ever &s;hare them.</P>
<P>To the per&s;onal arrogance of her mother,
&s;he added the hereditary pride of her fa|ther:
the fir&s;t had taught her that hardly
any man could de&s;erve &s;o perfect and ac|compli&s;hed
a creature; the &s;econd, that it
was more de&s;irable to unite her&s;elf with
<PB N="86" REF="88">
Willoughby, and thus continue her own il|lu&s;trious
race, than lo&s;e or &s;hare her con|&s;equence
by marrying a nobleman of &s;upe|rior
rank. Some degree of per&s;onal partiality
too, contributed to render this re&s;olution
more plea&s;ing to her; for though &s;he had
not &s;een her cou&s;in for between three and
four years, his graceful and beautiful form
when he left Eton, with his dark auburn
hair flowing over his &s;houlders, had made
a very la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion in his favor.</P>

<P>SUCH was the group, which, at a very
late hour in the evening, entered the din|ing-room
of Mrs. Molyneux, who, with
her hu&s;band and Cele&s;tina, received them
in the u&s;ual forms. Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, as

a&s;&s;urances that he would certainly be in
town the fir&s;t moment he po&s;&s;ibly could af|ter
hearing of the arrival of his noble re|lations.</P>
<P>"What &s;ort of ta&s;te, my dear," cried
her Lady&s;hip to Mrs. Molyneux, "is this
apartment fitted up in?&mdash;Is this the pre|&s;ent
&s;tyle in England?&mdash;I think it ex|tremely
ugly."</P>
<P>This was trenching on Matilda in a very
tender point. Ta&s;te was her reigning foi|ble;
<PB N="88" REF="90">
and the hou&s;e had, on her recent
marriage, been fitted up under her direc|tions
at an immen&s;e expence. To have
her elegance called &s;o abruptly in que&s;tion,
therefore, was very far from being plea&s;ant,
and &s;he an&s;wered coldly&mdash;"I am &s;orry you
di&s;like it: it is, I believe, the newe&s;t &s;tyle
of doing rooms. To what does your La|dy&s;hip
object?"</P>
<P>"Oh, to the whole. The&s;e &s;ort of pa|pers
are uncla&s;&s;ical and glaring: I don't
like the colour of your furniture neither."</P>
<P>"Nor I," interrupted Mrs. Calder; "'tis
terrible for the eyes: does not your Lord&s;hip
find it dazzling and inconvenient even by
candle-light?" She then began to explain
the effect of glaring and &s;trong colours on
the vi&s;ual orb, when Lady Ca&s;tlenorth,
who had no intention to throw the conver|&s;ation
into her hands, turned abruptly to|wards
Cele&s;tina, of whom &s;he had hitherto
taken no notice, and &s;aid, looking &s;teadily
at her while &s;he addre&s;&s;ed Mrs. Molyneux,
"That, I think, is the young woman whom
<PB N="89" REF="91">
your late mother <HI>&s;aid</HI> &s;he took out of a con|vent
&s;omewhere in France, is it not?"
Mrs.Molyneux an&s;wering in the affirmative,
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, her eyes &s;till fixed on
the object of her enquiry, &s;aid, "Aye, I
thought I recollected her:&mdash;Umph!&mdash;and
&s;o Mrs. Willoughby provided for her, did
&s;he?&mdash;Well! and is &s;he to live on with
you, as &s;he did in your mother's time?"</P>
<P>"Only a few days longer, Madam," &s;aid
Cele&s;tina, who had borne very impatiently
this rude and unfeeling &s;crutiny; "I am
then going to re&s;ide entirely in the coun|try."</P>
<P>"I am glad of it, child," replied the
lady; for I always con&s;ider it as a misfor|tune
when girls are educated above their
fortune, and introduced into a &s;tyle of life
they have no preten&s;ions to. Indeed, I
gave Mrs. Willoughby my opinion about
you repeatedly in your infancy. I did not
then know that her circum&s;tances allowed
her, in ju&s;tice to <HI>her hu&s;band's</HI> children, to
provide &s;o amply for another. However,
<PB N="90" REF="92">
though it was a great deal for her to do, it
is not by any means a fortune to authori&s;e
you with prudence to continue to live
about town. You took, I think, your
Chri&s;tian name from the order of Nuns
among whom you were reared; and your
&s;urname&mdash;I mean the name they gave
you&mdash;it has e&s;caped me?"</P>
<P>"My name, Madam," &s;aid Cele&s;tina,
who&s;e tears were re&s;trained only by indig|nation,
"is De Mornay."</P>
<P>"True; I recollect it now. I remem|ber
I enquired of Mrs. Willoughby, whe|ther
when they gave you that name they
had any rea&s;on to fancy you any way re|lated
to the family of the famous du Ple&s;&s;is
Mornay; but I think &s;he told me no, and
that you received that appellation becau&s;e
the Superior to who&s;e care you were en|tru&s;ted had &s;ome fanciful partiality to the
name."</P>
<P>To this no an&s;wer being given the con|ver&s;ation
took another turn, but was &s;till
engro&s;&s;ed by Lady Ca&s;tlenorth; while Mrs.
<PB N="91" REF="93">
Molyneux, wearied to death, propo&s;ed cards,
and making a table with the noble pair,
Mrs. Calder, and her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;at
down her&s;elf by Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, and
endeavoured to enter into conver&s;ation with
her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman however, who never
loved her cou&s;in becau&s;e &s;he had heard her
reckoned hand&s;ome, and who was out of
humour to find that Willoughby was not
yet arrived, though there was barely time
for him to have come expre&s;s, received all
her advances with more than her u&s;ual
haughty indifference; and while &s;he an|&s;wered
in &s;hort &s;entences or mere mono|&s;yllables,
&s;he now examined with looks of
di&s;like the &s;tudied but becoming dre&s;s of
Mrs. Molyneux, now, with yet more un|plea&s;ant
expre&s;&s;ion, glanced with averted
head, from the corners of her eyes, on Ce|le&s;tina,
who without any &s;tudy at all was
infinitely more beautiful.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;cowling looks of mingled malig|nity
and contempt, added to the behaviour
<PB N="92" REF="94">
of Lady Ca&s;tlenorth towards her, had by
this time rendered the room &s;o di&s;agreeable
to her, that &s;he left it as &s;oon as &s;he could.
A loud rap at the door however &s;oon after
announced the arrival of other vi&s;itors; and
&s;ome ladies coming in who had fini&s;hed
their circle of vi&s;its for that evening, Mrs.
Molyneux, as tired of the daughter's &s;i|lence
as &s;he had before been of the mother's
loquacity, propo&s;ed a table at <HI>vingt un,</HI>
which Cele&s;tina was immediately de&s;ired to
join.</P>
<P>The party were hardly placed at it, be|fore
Mr. Molyneux was informed by his
gentleman that Mr. Willoughby was be|low
and a&s;ked to &s;peak to him. "De&s;ire
him to come up," replied he, without any
&s;eeming con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the formidable na|ture
of the interview he was to go through.</P>
<P>"He is in boots, Sir," replied the &s;er|vant,
"and de&s;ired me to &s;ay that he is
going immediately to his lodgings."</P>
<P>"Oh but we &s;hall not let him go,"
&s;aid Molyneux. "Do Mrs. Molyneux,"
<PB N="93" REF="95">
continued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his
wife, "do go down and bring up this
brother of your's."</P>
<P>Mrs. Molyneux ro&s;e and left the room.
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, &s;till appearing to attend
to her game, turned her fiercely-que&s;tion|ing
eyes, fir&s;t on her daughter, who might
have blu&s;hed if her complexion had been
calculated to &s;hew the &s;uffu&s;ion of blood,
and then unluckily they were attracted by
the more unequivocal and deep ro&s;e co|lour,
which for a moment took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the face of Cele&s;tina, who &s;at next to her.</P>
<P>There was no time to comment on this
appearance before it was heightened by the
entrance of Willoughby, who was imme|diately
led by his &s;i&s;ter to Lord Ca&s;tlenorth,
then to her Lady&s;hip, and at length to
Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman. He paid his compli|ments
to all with his u&s;ual graceful man|ners,
but not without an expre&s;&s;ion of pain
and embarra&s;&s;ment in his countenance,
which he &s;eemed vainly trying to &s;hake off.
He had yet di&s;tingui&s;hed nobody in the
<PB N="94" REF="96">
room but tho&s;e to whom he had been
&s;peaking; but on recovering from the low
bow he had made to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
he &s;aw Cele&s;tina; and &s;tarting, he &s;aid in
a hurrying way&mdash;"Mi&s;s De Mornay! I
thought you had left my &s;i&s;ter! I hope I
&s;ee you well!" Cele&s;tina an&s;wered only by
a curt&s;ey; and Willoughby, turning away
towards Mrs. Molyneux, told her that he
was a good deal fatigued, and mu&s;t beg
her to excu&s;e him for the re&s;t of the even|ing,
but that he would be with her the
following morning to breakfa&s;t. "Your
Lord&s;hip," added he turning to his uncle,
"will perhaps allow me to pay my re&s;pects
to you and Lady Ca&s;tlenorth in the cour&s;e
of the morning:" then without waiting
for the reply which his Lord&s;hip was in
great form waiting to give him, he hurried
out of the room, and the card tables very
&s;oon afterwards broke up.</P>
<P>Though Willoughby was very much
altered &s;ince Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman had la&s;t
&s;een him, the change appeared greatly in
<PB N="95" REF="97">
his favour. His undre&s;s, and the agitation
he was apparently in, which &s;he imputed
to the effect of her charms, combined to
make him appear more intere&s;ting both to
the mother and daughter; and as they went
home, Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, who grew every
day fonder of the propo&s;ed marriage,
&s;poke much in prai&s;e of his nephew's fi|gure
and manner. He has a great deal,
&s;aid he, of the family countenance. He
&s;trikes me, indeed he always did from a
boy, as re&s;embling greatly the picture
painted on board of William, &s;on of Ro|bert
Fitz-Hayman, Sene&s;chal to Henry II.
who obtained the grants of the e&s;tate in
Glouce&s;ter&s;hire. His arms were azure, a
lion rampant, gardant or; the original
bearing of the family; you &s;ee it &s;o in the
great window of the hall at Ca&s;tlenorth:
the next is that of his wife, party per pale,
two griffins counter &s;ailant, &s;able, langued
gules. This is my fir&s;t quarter for the
name of Bigot, a daughter of which hou&s;e,
<PB N="96" REF="98">
this William, &s;on of Robert, married."
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth was now got on his
favourite topic, and in the numberle&s;s quar|terings
of his pre&s;ent bearing, he quite for|got
the merits of his nephew, and was
bu&s;ied among wyverns and boars, pearls,
&s;altiers, fe&s;&s;es and bend dexters, till they
arrived at their own hou&s;e. The imagina|tions
however of the re&s;t of the company
finding nothing to arre&s;t them in a detail
&s;o often repeated, had all left him to &s;ettle
his chevrons and chevronels his own way;
even the attentive and complai&s;ant Mrs.
Calder was con&s;idering whether a lady in
the company they had left, who had re|lated
her complaints to her, was in a right
cour&s;e of medicine; Lady Ca&s;tlenorth was
laying up a little magazine of literature,
which &s;he intended to open on Willoughby
the next day; and her daughter was con|templating
in her mind's eye, the hand|&s;ome
per&s;on of Willoughby, the figure
they &s;hould make at Court, and the tri|umph
<PB N="97" REF="99">
there would be, when without de|grading
her&s;elf, by an unequal alliance in
point of family, &s;he &s;hould notwith&s;tand|ing
carry to her hu&s;band &s;o &s;plendid a
fortune, and titles &s;o ancient and illu&s;|trious.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE party the noble vi&s;itors had left
were very differently employed: Mrs.
Molyneux, almo&s;t always accu&s;tomed to
be heard with attention and &s;ubmitted to
with deference as a beauty and a woman
of exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, was piqued and offended
by the air of &s;uperior intelligence a&s;&s;umed
by Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, who treated her like
a child that knew nothing. Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
too had not expre&s;&s;ed any admi|ration
at her dre&s;s and figure, but had
viewed her with &s;upercilious &s;ilence; while
Mrs. Calder, from knowing her to be a
young married woman, had with more cu|rio&s;ity
than elegance enquired whether &s;he
was likely to give the Molyneux family
the heir &s;o much de&s;ired by the older part
<PB N="99" REF="101">
of it; a que&s;tion which extremely di&s;gu&s;ted
her. Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, (who had compli|mented
her upon her per&s;on, particularly
on her long Chine&s;e eyes, and the form of
her face, which he &s;aid was extremely like
that of Gertrude Fitz-Hayman, &s;ome time
Maid of Honor to Catharine of Arragon and
afterwards Counte&s;s of Powis,) was, &s;he
declared to Mr. Molyneux, the only tole|rable
creature of the party. "My uncle,"
&s;aid &s;he, as &s;oon as they were alone, "my
uncle is a rea&s;onable being; but for the
re&s;t! did you ever &s;ee a plainer woman
than Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman? her cloaths might
be French, but I am &s;ure &s;he looks ab&s;o|lutely
Dutch in them. It's really a mis|fortune
at her time of life to be &s;o large."</P>
<P>Molyneux carele&s;sly an&s;wered&mdash;"You
&s;ee &s;he is &s;en&s;ible of the misfortune by her
endeavours to conceal it: but 'tis more
witty than wi&s;e, I think, to find fault with
her. Willoughby <HI>can &s;ee</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e as well
as you can, and I don't think it very po|litic
in you to give him your authority for
<PB N="100" REF="102">
di&s;liking her. Let him marry her, and
then hate and abu&s;e her as much as you
will."</P>
<P>"Oh!" replied the lady, "I &s;hall al|ways
dete&s;t her, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"So I dare &s;ay will he," interrupted
Molyneux; "but let them be once mar|ried,
and all that is very immaterial to you:
it is by no means &s;o, that your brother
cannot, till he does marry, pay the &s;econd
five thou&s;and pounds of your fortune, un|le&s;s
he &s;ells the Withcombe e&s;tate, which
indeed the mortgagee is, as far as I can
learn, very impatient to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
with this charge upon it, which he will
immediately pay off. You &s;ee that Wil|loughby
has no choice&mdash;matrimony or the
di&s;membering his e&s;tates; and pray never
put it into his head to he&s;itate." This af|fectionate
brother in law then went to his
own dre&s;&s;ing room, and Mrs. Molyneux
taking a candle, &s;urveying her&s;elf in the
great gla&s;s, and wondering how it was po&s;|&s;ible
&s;uch a figure and face could fail to at|tract
<PB N="101" REF="103">
univer&s;al admiration from all ages and
&s;exes, retired to her bed.</P>
<P>The contemplations of poor Cele&s;tina,
who had left them the moment the com|pany
di&s;per&s;ed, were much more painful.
The &s;ight of Willoughby, his &s;urprize, and,
as &s;he thought, his di&s;plea&s;ure at finding
her &s;till there, were as poi&s;oned arrows in
her brea&s;t. But the pride of con&s;cious
worth, aided by her di&s;intere&s;ted affection
for him, enabled her, though not to heal,
yet to endure without weak complainings,
the exqui&s;ite pain they inflicted, and to give
her courage immediately to execute the
de&s;ign &s;he had long formed of withdrawing
her&s;elf from his &s;ight for ever. It was now
impo&s;&s;ible for her to &s;et out the next day,
but that immediately following it &s;he fixed
for her departure; and after a night in which
&s;he enjoyed very little repo&s;e, &s;he aro&s;e
early in order to make the immediate pre|parations
for her journey, which &s;he deter|mined,
in order to &s;ave expence, to make
in the Exeter &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104">
As &s;he was de&s;irous of giving as little
trouble as po&s;&s;ible to Mr. Molyneux's &s;er|vants,
who were all people of great con&s;e|quence
and would any of them have
thought &s;uch a commi&s;&s;ion degrading, &s;he
determined to go her&s;elf into the city,
where places were to be taken. It was yet
&s;o early when &s;he went down to execute
this intention, that only the hou&s;emaid was
&s;tirring, and the windows of the parlour
only were opened: there Cele&s;tina &s;at
while the maid went into the kitchen to
get her a gla&s;s of milk and water, which
&s;he had a&s;ked for; and while &s;he yet trifled
with it, being indeed afraid to venture into
the &s;treets till &s;he &s;aw more people in them,
&s;he heard the &s;ervant, who was at the door
du&s;ting the hall and &s;teps, &s;peak to &s;ome|body
who entered, and the in&s;tant after|wards
Willoughby came into the room
where &s;he was.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e trembling and amazed from
her &s;eat. "Mi&s;s De Mornay," &s;aid he,
"&s;o early prepared to go out?" Cele&s;tina
<PB N="103" REF="105">
an&s;wered&mdash;"yes," and &s;at down again.
He laid down his hat on the &s;ide board;
and as if he knew not what to &s;ay, went to
the window.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina &s;at motionle&s;s; and Willough|by,
after &s;tanding there a moment, &s;eemed
a&s;hamed of his &s;ilence yet afraid to &s;peak.
He traver&s;ed the room, mended the fire,
and complaining of the cold, at length
ventured to enquire of Cele&s;tina what in|duced
her to venture out at &s;o early an
hour of &s;o unplea&s;ant a morning? She
replied calmly, for &s;he had by this time
regained her compo&s;ure, that &s;he had bu&s;i|ne&s;s
in the city.</P>
<P>"Bu&s;ine&s;s in the city!" cried Wil|loughby;
"and at this time of the day!
Ah! Cele&s;tina! there was a time when you
would not thus have an&s;wered my enquiry."
He was going on, when Cele&s;tina inter|rupted
him:</P>
<P>"There was indeed," &s;aid &s;he with a
deep &s;igh, "a time when you would not
have made it."</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106">
"Not have made it!" an&s;wered he;
"was I not then ever intere&s;ted in all that
concerned you, and was any action of
your's indifferent to me?"</P>
<P>He faultered and &s;topped. "I was once
&s;imple enough to think &s;o indeed," &s;aid
Cele&s;tina, "and in tho&s;e days of fortunate
illu&s;ion you certainly would have made no
&s;uch enquiry as the pre&s;ent, becau&s;e I
&s;hould then have done nothing of which
you would not have known the motive,
nor have taken any mea&s;ure without the
concurrence of my brother and my friend;
but as you told me your&s;elf&mdash;would I could
forget it!&mdash;that it was no longer in your
power to retain tho&s;e characters towards
me, I am learning to forget that I ever
was &s;o happy as to fancy that no change in
my &s;ituation, e&s;pecially a change for the
wor&s;e, could rob me of that regard &s;o va|luable
always, &s;o particularly valuable now!"</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven!" cried Willoughby,
entirely thrown off his guard by her words
and manner&mdash;"How have I acted, what
<PB N="105" REF="107">
have I &s;aid, to de&s;erve this reproach from
you Cele&s;tina? When we parted la&s;t&mdash;"</P>
<P>She again interrupted him&mdash;"Did we
part like friends? like brother and &s;i&s;ter?"</P>
<P>"No," replied he ha&s;tily; "but I tore
my&s;elf from you like a man who &s;acrifices,
to the performance of a fatal promi&s;e, his
own happine&s;s, and who is the victim of
family pride and family nece&s;&s;ity." This
&s;entence was deci&s;ive. His re&s;olution for|&s;ook
him at once, and his long &s;tifled af|fection
bur&s;t through all the re&s;traints he
determined to lay on it. "Oh! Cele&s;|tina!"
continued he, "you whom I loved
before I knew what it was to love! you
whom I now adore with a pa&s;&s;ion too &s;trong
for my rea&s;on! do not, do not, I be&s;eech
you, aggravate my &s;ufferings. I promi&s;ed
to my mother&mdash;and you know how well
&s;he de&s;erved to be obeyed&mdash;I promi&s;ed to
unite my&s;elf with her niece; I promi&s;ed to
extirpate from my heart an inclination that
even then I could not conceal. Ra&s;h and
ridiculous promi&s;e! No, Cele&s;tina, it is
<PB N="106" REF="108">
impo&s;&s;ible for me to cea&s;e loving you!
All my behaviour, which you have thought
cold and unfriendly, was a part I was act|ing
in oppo&s;ition to my real affections! I
can &s;u&s;tain it no longer: I cannot bear
that you &s;hould think of me with indiffer|ence:
and yet&mdash;Oh! my mother, what
a cruel ta&s;k have you impo&s;ed on me!
Cele&s;tina, pity me; I am more wretched
than you can imagine!" His agitation
now became too violent: he &s;eized the
hand of Cele&s;tina, and fervently ki&s;&s;ed it,
while her own &s;en&s;ations were &s;uch as no
language can de&s;cribe. That Willoughby
loved her, that what &s;he had con&s;idered as
indifference was owing to the &s;truggle be|tween
his duty and his tenderne&s;s, was
tran&s;port &s;uch as obliterated every other
&s;entiment. But this delirium la&s;ted but a
moment: her rea&s;on, her genuine affection
for him, told her, that to indulge this ten|derne&s;s
was injurious to him, and &s;he de|termined
to &s;hew that &s;he could &s;acrifice
her&s;elf to his advantage, and that con|tented
<PB N="107" REF="109">
with his brotherly attachment, &s;he
could re&s;ign him to the fortunate Mi&s;s
Fitz-Hayman. The terms however in
which &s;he declared this, the &s;oftne&s;s of her
voice, and her eyes filled with tears, were
little calculated to reconcile Willoughby
to the re&s;olution, which, after a long dia|logue,
&s;he urged him to adopt; &s;he a&s;&s;ured
him that whatever might be her own fate,
&s;he &s;hould never forgive her&s;elf were &s;he
to be the means of his breaking a promi&s;e
&s;o &s;olemnly given, and given at &s;uch a
time, to her dear decea&s;ed benefactre&s;s.
"No! my brother," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;he is
dead, but my obligations to her can never
be annihilated; and what would become
of me, were I ever to feel my&s;elf reproached
for ingratitude to her memory, were I to
de&s;troy the fabric &s;he had rai&s;ed for the
happine&s;s of her beloved &s;on, and to fancy
that the &s;pirit of my more than mother,
which I now often invocate with con&s;cious
plea&s;ure, &s;hould, in&s;tead of beholding her
Cele&s;tina with complacency not un&s;uited
<PB N="108" REF="110">
to her pre&s;ent &s;tate of happine&s;s, &s;ee her de|graded
into a &s;elfi&s;h and unworthy being,
who repays her benefits with the blacke&s;t
ingratitude."</P>
<P>Willoughby, who&s;e love, once &s;uffered
to obtain the advantage, now acquired
more power every moment, combated the&s;e
objections with very dangerous eloquence;
telling Cele&s;tina that he had determined the
evening before, on a &s;ight of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man,
who was in&s;upportable to him, to put
an end to the negociation, and &s;ay plainly
to his uncle that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him
to fulfil an engagement in which his heart
never had any &s;hare. Cele&s;tina repre&s;ented
to him the &s;ituation of his fortune; the ab|&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity there was for his marrying
one who could repair its deficiency, and
re&s;tore him to the &s;plendid affluence of his
ance&s;tors; but for this he talked of oeco|nomy
and &s;implicity, by which when they
lived entirely at Alve&s;tone he &s;hould be
able to repair every thing; then for a mo|ment
indulging his vivid imagination in
<PB N="109" REF="111">
painting the happine&s;s they &s;hould enjoy
there together, (images of felicity which
reflected in &s;tronger colours tho&s;e which
Cele&s;tina had a thou&s;and times formed,
though knowing they could never be rea|lized,)
he thought &s;uddenly of the fatal
promi&s;e he had given to his mother, and
his heart &s;eemed to &s;hrink from the idea
of breaking it to obtain even the highe&s;t
human happine&s;s, which under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances
he felt would be da&s;hed with
gall. He obtained however from Cele&s;tina,
but not without difficulty, a promi&s;e that
&s;he would lay a&s;ide her intentions of going
into the city that morning to prepare for
her journey, of which he would not hear;
and &s;he prevailed upon him to wait on Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth, as he had a&s;&s;ured the family
he would do: "Though wherefore &s;hould
I do it," &s;aid he, "unle&s;s to put an end at
once and for ever to all thoughts of this
odious marriage."</P>
<P>"You ought &s;urely," replied Cele&s;tina,
to wait on the brother of your mother tho'
<PB N="110" REF="112">
no &s;uch connection had been thought of:
and no di&s;like which you may have con|ceived
to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman as your wife,
&s;hould induce you to forget what you owe
to your uncle.</P>
<P>By arguments thus rea&s;onable, Cele&s;tina,
while &s;he prevailed on Willoughby to do
what was, he was forced to own, proper,
would have rivetted his chains, if indeed
they had not already been immoveable.
The noble candour and di&s;intere&s;ted gene|ro&s;ity
of her &s;oul, gave tenfold force to the
charms of her per&s;on, which &s;ince he had
la&s;t &s;een her, Willoughby thought greatly
improved: and the tenderne&s;s of her man|ner,
the certainty of her affection for him,
which &s;he tried to conceal with more kind|ne&s;s
than &s;ucce&s;s, had altogether &s;uch an
effect on him, that nothing but the fatal
promi&s;e which lay &s;o heavy on his heart,
could have prevented his marrying her
immediately, in de&s;pite of every con&s;ider|ation
of prudence or family engagement.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE Cele&s;tina remained with Wil|loughby,
the very tumult and agitation of
her heart had &s;u&s;tained her courage, and
like a fever that lends momentary &s;trength
to the patient it is de&s;troying, this di&s;order
of her &s;pirits had &s;upported her again&s;t the
flood of tenderne&s;s that overwhelmed her
as &s;oon as &s;he was alone. A conflict then
began between her affection for him and
her duty and gratitude towards the memory
of his mother, which was almo&s;t too &s;evere
to be endured; but however &s;oft her heart,
her rea&s;on was equal to the ta&s;k of check|ing
a dangerous or guilty indulgence of
that &s;en&s;ibility; and after long arguing
with her&s;elf, &s;he found &s;he loved Willough|by
better than every thing but his honor
and his repo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114">
The fir&s;t, and too probably the &s;econd,
&s;he &s;aw too plainly that he mu&s;t forfeit, by
yielding to an affection, which, circum|&s;tanced
as he was, would perhaps be as
fatal to both as it certainly was to his pe|cuniary
intere&s;t. She had heard Mr. Mo|lyneux
&s;ay, who had his rea&s;ons for repeat|ing
it before her, that nothing but his
marrying a woman as opulent as Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
could prevent his &s;elling the
greater part of his e&s;tates; "and in that
ca&s;e," added he, "I don't &s;ee how he can
avoid di&s;po&s;ing of Alve&s;ton too; for with
the income he will then have, to think of
keeping up &s;uch a place as that, would be
quite in&s;anity." Cele&s;tina knew that no
blow could fall &s;o heavy on the heart of
Willoughby, as the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling
this his paternal &s;eat; and though &s;he was
flattered and delighted when he had ju&s;t
before declared to her, that to obtain her
every deprivation would be ea&s;y, &s;he knew,
while &s;he now more coolly reflected on it,
his local attachment to be &s;o &s;trong, that it
<PB N="113" REF="115">
was very probable his love would &s;oon
yield to the regret which would ari&s;e from
their &s;acrifice. "What would become of
me," &s;aid &s;he as &s;he meditated on this mat|ter,
"were I to be the wife of Willoughby,
and to &s;ee him unhappy that I was &s;o? He
would have broken his faith to his mother;
he who has always been taught to hold the
&s;lighte&s;t promi&s;e &s;acred; he would &s;ee his
e&s;tate di&s;membered; even Alve&s;ton, the
place he &s;o loves, would pa&s;s into the hands
of &s;trangers, and it would be to me he
would owe his indigence and his unhappi|ne&s;s!
How dare I &s;uppo&s;e that my affec|tion,
warm and &s;incere as it is, could
make him any amends for all tho&s;e morti|fications.
Oh! let me not &s;uppo&s;e it, nor
ever think of ri&s;king it. I can bear to quit
him now&mdash;I believe I can&mdash;but how &s;hould
I endure to find my&s;elf the &s;ource of re|pentance
to him! how &s;hould I ever &s;ur|vive
&s;eeing him decidedly unhappy, with
the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he owed his being &s;o
to his partiality for me."</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116">
The&s;e reflections, and above all the ob|ligation
by which he had bound him&s;elf to
obey the la&s;t injunctions of his mother, de|termined
Cele&s;tina as to the conduct &s;he
ought to adopt; and having once &s;een it
by the light lent by integrity and di&s;inte|re&s;ted
love to her &s;trong and excellent
under&s;tanding, &s;he ha&s;tened to execute it,
and certain that he was engaged for the re&s;t
of the morning, &s;he had no &s;ooner break|fa&s;ted
than &s;he told Mrs. Molyneux &s;he
was going to make &s;ome purcha&s;es for
which &s;he had occa&s;ion before &s;he left Lon|don,
and getting into an hackney coach,
was driven into the City, where &s;he &s;ecured
a place in the Exeter &s;tage, which was to
leave London at a very early hour the
next day. She returned to the hou&s;e of
Mrs. Molyneux about twelve o'clock, and
then learned, that &s;he and her hu&s;band were
engaged to dine at Lord Ca&s;tlenorth's,
where a very large party were to a&s;&s;emble.
In the card which Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had
&s;ent to invite them, no mention was made
<PB N="115" REF="117">
of Cele&s;tina nor was any &s;eparate card &s;ent
to her. "It is mere forgetfulne&s;s I fancy,"
&s;aid Mrs. Molyneux as &s;he mentioned it to
her: "you will go however, as the cere|mony
of an invitation is not very material."</P>
<P>"Pardon me," replied Cele&s;tina, "it ap|pears
to me of &s;o much con&s;equence in the
pre&s;ent ca&s;e, that I certainly &s;hall not go
without it. I am indeed very glad to be
excu&s;ed, and I am &s;ure you will not urge
me to violate etiquette in a matter where
to forbear doing it is &s;o particularly de&s;ir|able."</P>
<P>Mrs. Molyneux, very &s;olicitous about
the contents of certain band boxes with
which her woman entered at that moment,
forbore to pre&s;s her farther, and Cele&s;tina
de&s;iring her to let her know when &s;he was
dre&s;&s;ed, that &s;he might &s;ee her before &s;he
went, retired to her own room, leaving her
friend to the plea&s;ing and important occu|pation
of the toilet, in which half what is
now called morning, was u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed by
Matilda.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118">
Cele&s;tina had promi&s;ed Willoughby to
give up for that day her intention of fixing
her journey; but this promi&s;e &s;he thought
her&s;elf well ju&s;tified in breaking. The en|tertainment
at Lord Ca&s;tlenorth's was given
on his account: of cour&s;e he would be en|gaged
the whole day; and &s;ince &s;he mu&s;t
go, &s;he de&s;ired nothing &s;o much as to be
&s;pared the fruitle&s;s pain of a farther di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion
of the &s;ubject, and the mi&s;ery, which
&s;he was not &s;ure her re&s;olution would &s;up|port,
of bidding him a la&s;t farewel.</P>
<P>At a little after five however, after &s;he
had undergone the form of &s;itting down
alone to table, where &s;he eat nothing, and
had then retired to her own room, Mrs.
Willoughby's woman came to &s;ay that her
mi&s;tre&s;s was dre&s;&s;ed. Cele&s;tina had once
determined to tell Mrs. Molyneux how
&s;oon &s;he meant to quit her, and to have
taken leave of her, but on reflection &s;he
thought her doing &s;o might betray her re|&s;olution
to Willoughby, from whom it was
nece&s;&s;ary to conceal it till it was actually
<PB N="117" REF="119">
executed. She now therefore intended to
leave a letter of thanks, and to take leave
of Mrs. Molyneux as if it was only till the
next day.</P>
<P>But when the moment approached in
which &s;he was in reality to bid adieu&mdash;per|haps
for ever&mdash;to the friend and companion
of her infancy&mdash;to the daughter of her be|loved
friend&mdash;to the &s;i&s;ter of Willoughby&mdash;her
heart &s;unk within her; and hardly had
&s;he &s;trength to go to the door of Mrs. Mo|lyneux's
dre&s;&s;ing room, on opening which
&s;he &s;aw her friend &s;tanding before the gla&s;s
putting the la&s;t fini&s;h to her very elegant
dre&s;s, while with her eyes fixed on her
own figure, &s;he was arguing with more
than her u&s;ual warmth with &s;ome per&s;on
who &s;at be&s;ide her, and who Cele&s;tina pre|&s;ently
di&s;covered to be Willoughby him|&s;elf,
in boots, and his hair out of powder.
His countenance was pale and dejected;
and while his &s;i&s;ter talked to him he leaned
with one arm on another chair, and &s;eemed
rather mu&s;ing than attending.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120">
"I am glad you are come," &s;aid Mrs.
Molyneux to Cele&s;tina as &s;he entered,
"for here is George behaving quite ab|&s;urdly:
he will not go he &s;ays to Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth's, though the dinner is made
on purpo&s;e for him. Do Cele&s;tina&mdash;he
minds your opinion always more than
mine&mdash;do try to make him under&s;tand
how very ab&s;urd and odly he acts."</P>
<P>"I have no talents," Cele&s;tina would
have &s;aid but the words died away on her
lips; and before &s;he could collect courage
to fini&s;h the &s;entence, Molyneux, who
was now ready, came in, and &s;eeing Wil|loughby
unprepared to go, expre&s;&s;ed his
&s;urprize in terms which were warmer than
Willoughby could hear with perfect com|mand
of temper. "Surely Sir," &s;aid he,
"I am my own ma&s;ter. I am not di&s;|po&s;ed
to go, and I will not go!"</P>
<P>"And what am I to &s;ay," cried Mrs.
Molyneux, "to Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, to my
uncle, and to my cou&s;in?"</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t what you plea&s;e," replied he.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="121">
Molyneux, finding by the tone in
which his brother in law &s;poke, that he
would not be dictated to, now called his
wife out of the room, and Willoughby and
Cele&s;tina were le&s;t alone.</P>
<P>It was now that all her fortitude and
&s;trength of mind were nece&s;&s;ary. Her duty
evidently was to per&s;uade Willoughby to
accompany his &s;i&s;ter and to complete a
marriage which his mother had when dy|ing
enjoined: a marriage &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to
the acqui&s;ition of all that the world calls
happine&s;s in life, and on which depended
the continuance of his family e&s;tate in his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But her heart refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;ent
to what her rea&s;on pointed out as the con|duct
&s;he ought to pur&s;ue, and the affection
he now &s;o evidently had for her, adding
to the &s;trength of her long attachment to
him, &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to urge his
quitting her for ever, though &s;he thought
&s;he had yet courage enough to tear her&s;elf
from him if &s;he heard not his complaints
<PB N="120" REF="122">
nor witne&s;&s;ed his agonies while &s;he com|bated
her own.</P>
<P>"I cannot&mdash;I will not go to the&s;e peo|ple,"
&s;aid Willoughby after a &s;hort &s;ilence:
why &s;hould I? &s;ince to marry Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
would be the height of cruelty to
her&mdash;&s;ince I am incapable of di&s;&s;imula|tion&mdash;&s;ince&mdash;In
&s;hort, Cele&s;tina, I feel
it to be impo&s;&s;ible for me to live with
her&mdash;to live without you; and I have de|termined
to declare my&s;elf in writing to
that effect."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, whom this &s;peech was not
calculated to calm, an&s;wered, trembling&mdash;"Indeed
I think you wrong, Mr. Wil|loughby.
As your uncle, as your mother's
brother, Lord Ca&s;tlenorth has undoubtedly
a claim to this mark of re&s;pect. It is not
probably expected to be any thing more
than a vi&s;it of form, and &s;urely you ought
not rudely and without rea&s;on to decline it."</P>
<P>"If it <HI>were indeed</HI> meant only as a vi&s;it
of ceremony," &s;aid he&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123">
"It is in your power however," inter|rupted
Cele&s;tina, "to appear to con&s;ider
it &s;o: your not going mu&s;t &s;eem very ex|traordinary;
your going certainly leads to
no con&s;equence."</P>
<P>"If you think &s;o," replied Willoughby;
if you think I ought to go.&mdash;But why did
they not a&s;k you?"</P>
<P>"Why &s;hould they a&s;k me?" an&s;wered
&s;he. "I am almo&s;t unknown to Lady Ca&s;tle|north;
and in the little time I ever did &s;ee
her, I appeared to be no favourite. Believe
me, &s;o far from being di&s;plea&s;ed I am re|joiced
at the omi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"In&s;olent, odious woman!" cried Wil|loughby.
"If any thing could add to
my di&s;like of her and her daughter, it
would be the &s;upercilious airs they gave
them&s;elves towards you even in the &s;hort
moment I &s;aw them here. But my Cele&s;|tina
&s;hall never be expo&s;ed to their in&s;ult|ing&s;corn;
and if I my&s;elf this time undergo
the puni&s;hment of keeping up the hateful
farce which I have &s;o unhappily been en|gaged
<PB N="122" REF="124">
in, it &s;hall be with a determination
to put an end to it."</P>
<P>At this moment Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux
entered the room; and Cele&s;tina wi&s;hing
them all an agreeable day, left it; having
&s;u&s;tained with &s;ome difficulty the various
emotions which were contending in her
bo&s;om. Willoughby &s;oon after left the
hou&s;e, to dre&s;s at his own lodgings, which
were in the neighbourhood, and having
promi&s;ed to join his brother and &s;i&s;ter at
dinner, they &s;oon after departed them&s;elves,
much better &s;atisfied with him than they
were before his &s;hort conver&s;ation with
Cele&s;tina.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA, though more unwil|ling
than ever to go, had pre&s;cribed to
her&s;elf in her cooler moments a line of con|duct,
from which, feeling it her duty to
adhere to it, &s;he now determined not to
depart. In arguing with her&s;elf on it's pro|priety,
and &s;trengthening her faultering
re&s;olution, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the night. At four
o'clock the &s;ervant who was commi&s;&s;ioned
to awaken her, came to her door: &s;he aro&s;e
and dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf by candle-light: the
morning was cold and dark: every object
appeared dreary and forlorn: &s;he hurried
on her cloaths however, and endeavoured
to drive away every recollection that might
enfeeble her &s;pirits too much; but, as &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed the door of the drawing room, &s;he
<PB N="124" REF="126">
remembered that it was there &s;he had &s;een
Willoughby perhaps for the la&s;t time, and
almo&s;t involuntarily &s;he went in, and by
the light of her &s;olitary candle, contem|plated
a whole length picture of him which
had ju&s;t been fini&s;hed for his &s;i&s;ter: the
likene&s;s was &s;o &s;trong, that by the waver|ing
and uncertain light that fell upon it,
&s;he almo&s;t fancied he was about to &s;peak to
her: &s;he &s;tarted at the idea, and feeling a
fort of chilly terror at the &s;ilence and ob|&s;curity
of every thing around her, &s;he
turned away and ha&s;tened to the &s;ervant
who had prepared her tea in the parlour:
&s;he had however hardly time to drink it,
before the hackney coach which had been
ordered the night before was at the door;
and having &s;een what little baggage &s;he
had not before &s;ent put into it, &s;he &s;tepped
in her&s;elf, and was &s;oon at a di&s;tance from
the re&s;idence of Mrs. Molyneux, from the
friend of her early years, and was launched
alone and unprotected into a world of
which &s;he had yet &s;een nothing but through
<PB N="125" REF="127">
the favourable medium lent by affluence
and pro&s;perity to tho&s;e who from thence
contemplate difficulties they are never
likely to encounter and calamities they
probably never can participate.</P>
<P>That a young woman, who might &s;till
have enjoyed tho&s;e indulgences, &s;hould re|nounce
them at an age when they have &s;o
many charms; that Cele&s;tina, who had
been educated with &s;o much delicacy, and
accu&s;tomed &s;ince her fir&s;t recollection: to
every indulgence, &s;hould thus voluntarily
enter on a life of comparative hard&s;hip
and deprivation, may appear improbable,
but when it is added that &s;he quitted the
man to whom &s;he had &s;o long been fondly
attached, and leaving him to her fortunate
rival, devoted her&s;elf to a life of &s;olitude
and regret, &s;uch an effort of heroi&s;m in a
woman not yet quite nineteen, might be
cla&s;&s;ed among impo&s;&s;ibilities, were it re|lated
of any other than Cele&s;tina: but her
character was an uncommon one: though
&s;he had always been told by Mrs. Wil|loughby
<PB N="126" REF="128">
that her birth was very uncertain,
and that nothing was known of it but that
it was di&s;graceful to her parents, &s;ince they
had taken &s;uch pains to conceal it, &s;he felt
within her&s;elf a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of hereditary
worth, an innate pride, which would never
&s;uffer her to believe her&s;elf de&s;cended from
mean or unworthy per&s;ons: her open and
commanding countenance, where &s;at dig|nity
mingled with &s;weetne&s;s; her nymph|like
and graceful form, which might have
rivalled the models of Grecian art; were
advantages of which, though &s;he was not
vain of them, &s;he could not be in&s;en&s;ible,
and if &s;he had any foible, (a perfect cha|racter
it has been &s;aid mu&s;t not be repre|&s;ented
becau&s;e it cannot exi&s;t) if &s;he had
any foible, it was carrying a little too far,
though &s;he carefully concealed it, that &s;ort
of pride which &s;eemed born with her, and
which, after all that has been &s;aid again&s;t
it, is often, e&s;pecially in a young and
beautiful woman, a fortunate defect.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129">
The circum&s;tances of her birth had &s;el|dom
been touched upon in the family, for
it was a topic which could not but be pain|ful
to her: but if ever any thing relating to
it had been accidentally introduced, when
Mrs. Willoughby was conver&s;ing with her
three children, (as &s;he often termed Wil|loughby,
Matilda, and Cele&s;tina,) Wil|loughby
would &s;ay laughingly that it was
impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could be born of French
parents: his mother had been &s;ometimes
half angry at this a&s;&s;ertion, in which how|ever
he u&s;ually per&s;i&s;ted, a&s;&s;erting, with
prejudice that &s;he declared to be entirely
Engli&s;h, that no native of the South of
France ever had a complexion or a form
like her's. After &s;he grew up, though
the&s;e perfections became more eminent,
Willoughby never appeared to notice them;
with the improvement of her form, her
mind kept pace; and as it acquired every
day more &s;trength, &s;he gradually became
more &s;en&s;ible of her obligation to her be|nefactre&s;s;
but while &s;he indulged her gra|titude
<PB N="128" REF="130">
towards the friend on whom &s;he de|pended,
&s;he felt that &s;he was not born to be
dependent.</P>
<P>This elevation of &s;pirit now &s;upported
her; and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s &s;he was acting
right, blunted for a while the poignancy of
that pain which &s;he too &s;en&s;ibly felt in tear|ing
her&s;elf from Willoughby. Obliged to
act for her&s;elf, having no brea&s;t on which
&s;he could with propriety lean, her naturally
exalted &s;oul acquired new firmne&s;s, before
which trifling inconveniences di&s;appeared;
and with an heart occupied by the beloved
image of Willoughby, and the &s;acrifice
&s;he was making for him, &s;he hardly re|membered
that &s;he had never in her life
been in a &s;tage coach before, till &s;he found
her&s;elf &s;eated in one under the dark gate|way
of an inn in the city at five o'clock in a
dreary winter morning.</P>
<P>Two female pa&s;&s;engers had already taken
their places; one of whom expre&s;&s;ed great
anxiety for a number of hat boxes and cara|van
trunks which the people belonging to
<PB N="129" REF="131">
the inn were placing in different parts of
the coach, while the lady particularly re|commended
to their care one box, which
&s;he a&s;&s;ured them contained her new <HI>laylock</HI>
bonnet, an article for the &s;afety of which
&s;he was &s;o &s;olicitous that &s;he would have
taken the great machine in which it was
contained into the coach, had it not been
oppo&s;ed by the coachman, and pre&s;ently
after by a man who had been drinking
with him, and who now preparing to enter
the coach, prote&s;ted vehemently again&s;t
this whim of his &s;i&s;ter Mary's.&mdash;"Who
d'ye think will be &s;croughed and crammed
up," cried he, "with your confounded
trumpery? No, no &s;uch thing. Here Da|niel,
prythee take and &s;tow it &s;omewhere
or another: it &s;hall not enter the coach,
I'll be &s;worn."</P>
<P>The man then placed him&s;elf by the &s;ide
of the other female pa&s;&s;enger, oppo&s;ite to
Cele&s;tina, and appeared to be as anxious
for his own ea&s;e as his &s;i&s;ter was for the
&s;afety of her wardrobe. The coach moved
<PB N="130" REF="132">
on, but it was &s;till quite dark, and &s;ilence
prevailed for the fir&s;t four or five miles, in|terrupted
only by &s;ome fretful expre&s;&s;ions
from the lady of the bandboxes, at the in|conveniences
to which people were &s;ub|jected
by going in &s;tage coaches, and &s;ome
exclamations again&s;t the unfortunate damp|ne&s;s
of the morning, which &s;he declared
would certainly penetrate the covering and
entirely &s;poil her <HI>laylock</HI> bonnet, which &s;he
&s;aid co&s;t her three guineas.</P>
<P>"The more fool you," cried her bro|ther,
who was of a character Cele&s;tina had
never had an opportunity of &s;eeing before,
that of a country trade&s;man affecting to be
a wit and a buck&mdash;"the more fool you, &s;i&s;ter
Mary. What! d'ye think a three guinea
bonnet will make you look three years
younger? No, no, take my word for it,
your flounces, and fringes, and furbelows
&s;erve for no purpo&s;e at all but to &s;hew your
wrinkles."</P>
<P>"Wrinkles!" repeated the lady di&s;|dainfully,
"what do you mean, John

Jedwyn? I declare you are &s;o rude and
di&s;agreeable I always repent travelling
with you. I wi&s;h you would find out ano|ther

<P>"Egad," an&s;wered Jedwyn, "I can|not
have a wor&s;e than your wrinkles, that's
true enough; and upon my &s;oul," added
he, looking confidently in the face of Ce|le&s;tina
and then in that of the other female
pa&s;&s;enger, who, though pale and thin, was
very young and very pretty, "here <HI>is</HI> two
better &s;ubjects, one a&s;ide of me and t'other
oppo&s;ite: no, no, &s;i&s;ter of mine, now day
breaks a little, and lets a body &s;ee how the

wrinkles; for as Hamlet &s;ays&mdash;let me &s;ee&mdash;aye&mdash;"here's
that metal that's more at|tractive;
hey, Mi&s;s?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, to whom this hey Mi&s;s was
addre&s;&s;ed, who had till now been very lit|tle
aware of the &s;pecies of rudene&s;s and
impertinence to which her mode of tra|velling
might &s;ubject her, was &s;hocked
and alarmed at this addre&s;s from a per&s;on,
<PB N="132" REF="134">
who, had he &s;een her a few days before,
would have approached her with awe and
&s;poken to her with di&s;&s;idence. She re|mained
&s;ilent however, ca&s;ting a look on
the man &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of the con|tempt
&s;he felt for him: but he was not of
a humour to be ea&s;ily daunted or repul&s;ed,
and without &s;eeming to under&s;tand her,
began, with pur&s;e-proud pertne&s;s to relate
as if it was a narrative which all the world
&s;hould be informed of, that he was a gro|cer
and chandler at Exeter, in a very flou|ri&s;hing
trade, and in partner&s;hip with a
gentleman who had married one of his
&s;i&s;ters: "and this <HI>laylock</HI> bonnet lady,"
continued he, "is my elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, who
has been a <HI>wi&s;iting</HI> this half year and better
an old aunt of our's at Camberwell. She
is an old maid her&s;elf, but devili&s;h rich,
and from a &s;ort of fellow feeling you know
&s;he intends to make our Mary here her
heir. The old girl mu&s;t hop the perch

<PB N="133" REF="135">
niece a hu&s;band it's my opinion, unle&s;s
may be an Iri&s;hman or a &s;trolling player."</P>
<P>This &s;econd attack on her&s;elf, and his
vi&s;ible admiration of Cele&s;tina's beauty,
compleated the ill humour of his &s;i&s;ter, who
with a look where anger and &s;corn con|tended
for preeminence, remained &s;ilently
&s;welling, while the facetious trader again
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>"What do you never make talking?
Come, &s;ince now you have a hi&s;tory of me,
let's hear a little who you are, and where
you are bound to?"</P>
<P>"Sir," replied Cele&s;tina, "it is impo&s;&s;i|ble
that either can be of any con&s;equence
to you."</P>
<P>"How are you &s;ure of that?" cried Mr.
Jedwyn with a loud laugh: "now I
think nothing is more likely than that we
may be better acquainted. 'Tis nothing
now I believe for a young man of &s;pirit, as
well in the world as I am, to take a fancy
to a pretty woman."</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">
"A fancy!" exclaimed Mi&s;s Mary
Jedwyn, with great acrimony&mdash;"a fancy!
Jack Jedwyn I am amazed at you!"</P>
<P>"And why amazed, my ancient &s;pin|&s;ter?"
retorted he. "What the devil! I'm
my own ma&s;ter I hope. To be &s;ure you
are &s;ome fifteen or twenty years older than
me. But what of that?&mdash;So much the
wor&s;e for you. I hope I a'nt to be go|verned
by a duenna. What a plague,
mayn't I talk to a hand&s;ome girl I wonder
without your putting in your &s;quinnygut
opinion?"</P>
<P>"If you intend to in&s;ult me," an&s;wered
the lady, trying to hide under the appear|ance
of calm contempt her great di&s;po&s;ition
to cry:&mdash;"if you intend to in&s;ult me, I
am &s;ure I heartily wi&s;h I had got the better
of my fears and travelled alone in a po&s;t
<HI>cbai;</HI> for no rudene&s;s as I might have met
on the road could be wor&s;e than your's."</P>
<P>"That's your gratitude now, cried Jed|wyn,
for my coming up clear from Exeter
to fetch you at a time when I had no
<PB N="135" REF="137">
bu&s;ine&s;s in London nor &s;hould a had for
the&s;e &s;ix weeks: that's your thanks for my
kindne&s;s, and for li&s;tening to your non&s;en|&s;ical
fears and frights. Rude to you! oh
Lord! as if any mortal man who has eyes
would ever look at you twice. No Mary!
make your&s;elf ea&s;y; that weazen, winterly
vi&s;age of your's, is fafeguard enough if you
were to travel from here to Jericho."</P>
<P>He then began to mimic his &s;i&s;ter, and
enlarge on the terrors to which &s;he was, he
&s;aid, perpetually &s;ubject, le&s;t &s;ome &s;ad
daring rake of a man &s;hould carry her away:
and had he been le&s;s gro&s;s and di&s;gu&s;ting,
Cele&s;tina would hardly have forborne a
&s;mile at &s;ome part of the ludicrous repre|&s;entation
he gave of this apprehen&s;ive de|licacy
and trembling nicety, for which &s;he
could not, in the per&s;onal attractions of
Mi&s;s Jedwyn, find any rea&s;onable grounds;
for &s;he was very tall, very thin, and very
yellow: her long, &s;craggy neck, appeared
hardly adequate to the &s;upport of a head,
where art had &s;o redundantly been called
<PB N="136" REF="138">
in aid of nature, that it &s;eemed to abound
in &s;hining black hair, nicely curled, with|out
powder, which was &s;uffered to wanton
over her forehead and flow down her back,
while a little white beaver hat, perched on
one &s;ide, was meant to give to her counte|nance
that bewitching archne&s;s which &s;he
had ob&s;erved that mode of head dre&s;s to
be&s;tow on the young and lovely.</P>
<P>Mr. Jedwyn having exhau&s;ted all his
immediate &s;tock of wit on his &s;i&s;ter, now
left her to dige&s;t the indignation he had
rai&s;ed, and applied him&s;elf again to Cele&s;|tina.
Having no idea that any thing but
money be&s;towed con&s;equence, and having
lived the greater part of his time among
tho&s;e who had le&s;s of it than him&s;elf, he
had never been accu&s;tomed to allow of any
&s;uperiority, nor could he comprehend how
a young woman &s;o humbly &s;ituated in life,
as to travel in a &s;tage coach, could help
being charmed into liking by his wit, and
awed into complai&s;ance by his importance.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139">
On &s;uch a man the native dignity of
Cele&s;tina failed totally of it's u&s;ual effect.
He became more and more trouble&s;ome;
for he was piqued but not repre&s;&s;ed by the
coldne&s;s and even contempt of her manner.
He told her, among much other imperti|nence,
that all her &s;hyne&s;s &s;hould not hin|der
him from finding out who &s;he was;
and then with yet more offen&s;ive familiarity
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the other young wo|man,
who he thought belonged to her, and
who heard his conver&s;ation with terror and
di&s;like as great as that of Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>His behaviour at length becoming in|&s;upportably
unea&s;y to her, Cele&s;tina, when
the coach reached the village where they
were to breakfa&s;t, determined not to &s;ub|ject
her&s;elf to it any longer; &s;he therefore
ordered her tea to be carried into another
room, and a po&s;t chai&s;e to be ready as &s;oon
as &s;he had drank it.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;at at her breakfa&s;t, &s;he &s;aw the
young woman, who&s;e countenance had
greatly intere&s;ted her, walk by the window
<PB N="138" REF="140">
&s;lowly and dejectedly, one hand held to her
forehead, and an handkerchief in the other.
Ever ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the unhappy, the ge|nerous
heart of Cele&s;tina was touched with
compa&s;&s;ion towards this forlorn &s;tranger.
"She is as young as I am," &s;aid &s;he, "and
perhaps even more unfortunate. Why
&s;hould I not take her with <HI>me,</HI> if &s;he is, as
I &s;uppo&s;e, travelling the &s;ame road? why
&s;hould I leave her expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of
that odious man, which, humble as her for|tune
&s;eems to be, &s;he ill knows how to
bear. I may at lea&s;t, though I cannot
otherwi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;ave her from pa&s;&s;ing
the remainder of the journey improperly
and unplea&s;antly." Cele&s;tina then rang the
bell, and directing her fellow traveller to
be called, de&s;ired her not only to partake
of her breakfa&s;t, but to accompany her the
re&s;t of the way in a po&s;t chai&s;e which &s;he
had ordered, to e&s;cape from Mr. Jedwyn.</P>
<P>The young per&s;on, notwith&s;tanding the
kindne&s;s of Cele&s;tina's addre&s;s, &s;till conti|nued
&s;tanding, and with a faint blu&s;h &s;aid,
<PB N="139" REF="141">
"You are very good Madam;&mdash;but&mdash;though
we happen to be in the &s;ame coach
I am &s;ure I ought not to put my&s;elf on a
footing with you: I am only a &s;ervant, tra|velling
into the country to my friends to
recover my health, and it would be very
wrong in me to intrude on a lady like you."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, won by this humble &s;implicity,
&s;oon rea&s;&s;ured her new acquaintance, and
&s;oon after Je&s;&s;y Woodburn, (which was
her name,) followed Cele&s;tina to the chai&s;e;
where having paid the coach in London,
&s;he now had directed her box to be placed.</P>
<P>Mr. Jedwyn left the hot rolls and cho|colate
with which he was regaling him&s;elf,
to remon&s;trate at the chai&s;e door again&s;t
this &s;ece&s;&s;ion. Cele&s;tina, without giving
him any an&s;wer, drew up the gla&s;&s;es the
moment &s;he was &s;eated, which gave Jed|wyn
an opportunity to &s;ay to the po&s;tillion,
who was not yet on hor&s;eback, that if he
would in the cour&s;e of a fortnight find out
who the lady was, and whither &s;he went, he
would make up the half crown he then
<PB N="140" REF="142">
gave him half a guinea. The boy readily
promi&s;ed to execute to the be&s;t of his
power &s;o lucrative a commi&s;&s;ion; and Ce|le&s;tina
and her companion were &s;oon at a
di&s;tance, and proceeded on their journey
much plea&s;ed with the exchange they had
made of a conveyance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA having by her ea&s;y and
gentle manners conquered part of the ex|treme
diffidence of her companion, began
to que&s;tion her about her &s;ituation in life;
and as &s;he had one of tho&s;e faces and one
of tho&s;e voices which win every heart
where any &s;park of feeling is found, Je&s;&s;y
&s;oon found her&s;elf enough at ea&s;e and even
flattered by the intere&s;t &s;he &s;eemed to take
in her fate, as to acquire courage to relate
the following narrative.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t go back a great way, Madam,
&s;ince you command me to tell you all I
know of my&s;elf; even as far as my grand|father,
who is &s;till living, and who is one of
the riche&s;t farmers in our part of De|von&s;hire
u&s;ing his own land, as all his
<PB N="142" REF="144">
family I have heard have done before him
for a great many years. He married a
clergyman's daughter who had been edu|cated
very well, greatly indeed above the
&s;ort of life &s;he was to lead as a farmer's
wife. But &s;he was very pretty. Her fa|ther
left her unprovided for, and &s;o &s;he
married perhaps more for money than love.
My mother was the only child they ever
had, and my grandmother, though her
own education had only &s;erved to make
her unhappy, would fain have had her
daughter brought up as &s;he had been
her&s;elf; but her hu&s;band, of a very hard
and ob&s;tinate temper and repenting perhaps
of having married a wife too fine for him,
was &s;o far from allowing her to have any
education, that he went to the other ex|treme;
in&s;i&s;ting that his girl &s;hould do as
his mother did thirty or forty years before,
and not only be taught to under&s;tand all
the bu&s;ine&s;s of the farm, but to live as he
did him&s;elf, and as he obliged his wife to
do, the &s;ame as the farming men.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">
The con&s;equence of this difference of
opinion was fatal to my poor mother: one
of her parents took every opportunity of
giving her notions above her&s;elf, which
very naturally, &s;he ea&s;ily took; and the
other &s;eemed to delight in humbling and
degrading her: when &s;he was about eigh|teen
&s;he lo&s;t her mother, and then was
forced to &s;ubmit to the har&s;h and unnece&s;|&s;ary
confinement impo&s;ed upon her by her
father, from whom &s;he endeavoured to
conceal her pa&s;&s;ion for reading, which
only gained &s;trength by this unrea&s;onable
re&s;traint. Home was very unea&s;y to her,
but &s;he could hardly ever leave it but by
&s;tealth. As &s;he was likely to have a very
good fortune, &s;he had numberle&s;s &s;uitors;
but my grandfather would &s;uffer none of
them to &s;ee her; de&s;igning to marry her
to a relation of his own almo&s;t as old as
him&s;elf, to whom &s;he had an invincible
aver&s;ion, which through the timidity of
her nature &s;he dared not declare.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146">
A neighbouring farmer, with whom my
grandfather had for many years been at
variance, and with whom he had had two
or three law-&s;uits, had two &s;ons, both
brought up to his own bu&s;ine&s;s; the elde&s;t
was married and had a family, but the
other had been &s;poiled by his mother,
and the notice taken of him by the neigh|bouring
gentlemen on account of his &s;kill
in field &s;ports; he had indeed always been
rather fonder of being with them at cricket
matches, and races, than minding his
farm. He found means to introduce him|&s;elf
to my mother, though he had been
po&s;itively refu&s;ed by my grandfather: he
won her affections, and after &s;everal pri|vate
meetings &s;he agreed to go off with
him: the con&s;equence of which was her
having the door of her paternal hou&s;e &s;hut
again&s;t her for ever.</P>
<P>For a little time after this marriage my
mother was received at the hou&s;e of her
father in law, but on his death it became
the right of the elde&s;t &s;on, who had a
<PB N="145" REF="147">
number of children; and as my father's fa|mily
were all irritated and di&s;appointed
by the ob&s;tinate re&s;entment of my grand|father
towards his daughter, they &s;oon
behaved with &s;uch unkindne&s;s towards
her, that &s;he prevailed on my father to
quit them, and take a little farm of his
own, which he with difficulty borrowed
money enough to &s;tock, for he had long
&s;ince paid away in di&s;charge of old debts,
all the money left him by his father. He
had been &s;o long u&s;ed to an idle, or ra|ther
a gay life, that he could not now ac|cu&s;tom
him&s;elf to the labour requi&s;ite on
&s;o &s;mall a farm. My mother however by
ince&s;&s;ant attention remedied for &s;ome years
this deficiency on his part; and though
nothing was laid by, they contrived to
live; my mother making from time to
time attempts to obtain her father's pardon,
though &s;he received nothing but cruel and
po&s;itive refu&s;als, either to &s;ee her or her
children, or ever to give them the lea&s;t
a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148">
This hardne&s;s of heart, which &s;hould
have excited pity, only made my father
treat my poor mother with har&s;hne&s;s too.
A young man of fortune in the neighbour|hood
ju&s;t then coming of age, was often
at his &s;eat near our little farm, and took
&s;uch a fancy to my father that he was al|ways
at his hou&s;e, living as he lived, and
a&s;&s;ociating with gentlemen from London,
and women they brought down with them.
He never came home but in &s;uch a terrible
humour, that I and my &s;i&s;ter, who were
then about ten and nine years old, u&s;ed to
be terrified to death; yet when he was
gone, as he &s;ometimes was for weeks toge|ther,
my mother lamented his ab&s;ence and
the lo&s;s of his affection, much more than
the fatigue, poverty, and &s;orrow, to which
his conduct expo&s;ed us all.</P>
<P>"Pre&s;ent anxiety and the fear of leaving
me and my &s;i&s;ter to a fate as deplorable as
her own, together with the ince&s;&s;ant toil
attending the care of a farm wholly neg|lected
by her hu&s;band, gradually de&s;troyed
<PB N="147" REF="149">
her con&s;titution, till at la&s;t, Madam, her
heart was quite broken. When &s;he found
&s;he had only a few hours to live, &s;he en|treated
the clergyman of the pari&s;h to go
to her father, and beg, if he would not &s;ee
her, that he would only &s;end her his for|givene&s;s,
for &s;he could not die in peace
without it.</P>
<P>"Even that he had the cruelty to refu&s;e!
I lo&s;t my dear mother, Madam; and my
&s;i&s;ter, who was always of a weak con&s;titution,
followed her &s;oon afterwards to the grave.
Ah! how often have I wi&s;hed that I had
died too. Troubles now multiplied around
us: my father's great friend had by this
time &s;o compleatly ruined him&s;elf, that
every thing was &s;eized and he left the
country. My father having no longer a
hou&s;e to be at, was forced to live at home;
but it was only for a little while; for dur|ing
my mother's illne&s;s every thing had
been neglected, and we could not pay our
rent; &s;o the landlord &s;eized, our cattle
<PB N="148" REF="150">
were &s;old, and we were turned out of the
farm and went to a mi&s;erable cottage in
the next village; where, as my father was
&s;o unu&s;ed to work, we &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for a while
on the reluctant charity of my uncle, who&s;e
daughters were always reproaching me with
taking their bread from them. Believe
me, Madam, I did all I could do to earn
it for my father and my&s;elf: but what
could hands &s;o feeble as mine do towards
&s;upporting us both. I made an attempt
to &s;ee my grandfather, and to implore his
pity and protection towards one who had
never offended him; but he ordered me
to be driven from his door, and never
again &s;uffered to appear there: orders which
tho&s;e he had about him were ready enough
to execute. I returned home quite di&s;|heartened
indeed, but &s;till endeavouring to
the utmo&s;t of my power to procure a &s;up|port
by my labour for my father and my|&s;elf;
I even went out to work in the fields;
but all I could earn was &s;o in&s;ufficient that
we often wanted nece&s;&s;ary food, at lea&s;t <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="151">
have often wanted it. But my father had
made an acquaintance with a widow wo|man
in the next village, who was &s;aid to
be worth forty or fifty pounds. She was
young too and not ugly, and in le&s;s than
a year after my dear mother's death, he
married her, and we removed to her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"The extremes of poverty I had before
known, bitter as I thought them, were
comparatively happine&s;s to what I now en|dured.
I became the &s;ervant of my mother
in law, only without wages. She &s;oon
brought my father an increa&s;e of family:
to them then I was nur&s;e, and very &s;oon
had neither &s;leep by night or re&s;pite by day.
I thought it my duty to bear every thing
for my father, without murmuring, but as
my fatigue and &s;ufferings encrea&s;ed, my
dejection encrea&s;ed too, and I was &s;ome|times
through mere de&s;pondence unable to
fulfil my heavy ta&s;ks, in which if I failed
in the flighte&s;t degree, I was in&s;ulted with
opprobious language and told to go to my
rich grandfather.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152">
"Alas! my rich grandfather continued
inexorable; but home was &s;o dreadful that
I determined to go to &s;ervice, being near
twenty, and able I thought to undertake
any place that could be offered me; for a
harder than that I now filled, it was im|po&s;&s;ible
to meet with.</P>
<P>"I applied to a relation I had at Exeter,
who after &s;ome enquiries procured me a
place in the family of an attorney in Lon|don,
who was willing to di&s;pen&s;e with my
want of experience in favour of my being
a country &s;ervant. Thither therefore I
went, and entered as cheerfully as I could
on a new mode of life; endeavouring to
forget that I ever had any expectations of
a better. The dark, damp places where
the &s;ervants of per&s;ons in the midling ranks
of life, live in the city, appeared very
dreadful to me; and it was my bu&s;ine&s;s,
after a day of fatiguing work, to &s;it up for
my ma&s;ter or the clerks, who were often
out very late. My mi&s;tre&s;s too was a very
fine lady, and kept a great deal of com|pany,
<PB N="151" REF="153">
and it was part of my employment
to wait on her own maid, who was al&s;o a
&s;ort of hou&s;ekeeper, and much more diffi|cult
to be plea&s;ed than the lady her&s;elf:
&s;he took care indeed that I &s;hould never
want bu&s;ine&s;s; but determined as I was
never again to be a burthen to my father,
I went through the duties of my place,
heavy as they were, with courage and
&s;teadine&s;s; &s;o that even this &s;econd mi&s;tre&s;s,
however unwilling to be plea&s;ed, could
not find fault with me.</P>
<P>"Among a great number of clerks that
my ma&s;ter kept, there was one who was
employed merely to copy, and was not
admitted among the re&s;t, though he looked
I am &s;ure more like a gentleman than any
of them. He did not lodge in the hou&s;e,
but came every morning early to his work,
and &s;at at it, poor young man! till five or
&s;ix o'clock at night, when he dined with
us &s;ervants, after the family and other clerks
had done. Often indeed, in&s;tead of eating,
he would &s;igh all dinner time as if his heart
<PB N="152" REF="154">
would break; and I could not help fancy|ing
that he had been u&s;ed to live quite in
other company; though he never &s;eemed
above ours, but was always very obliging,
though he was very melancholy.</P>
<P>"It happened once, that my ma&s;ter had
&s;ome extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s to do that re|quired
great ha&s;te; it was &s;ome papers that
were to be &s;ent to India; and Mr. Cathcart,
the young man I have been &s;peaking of,
hearing my ma&s;ter &s;ay how afraid he was he
&s;hould not get ready, offered to work all
day on Sunday, when none of the re&s;t of
the clerks would have &s;taid from their plea|&s;ure
on any account. My ma&s;ter was
plea&s;ed with his willingne&s;s to oblige, and
he &s;at down to his ta&s;k. Nobody was in
the hou&s;e but him and me; for it was the
cu&s;tom of my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s to dine in
the country on a Sunday with my mi&s;tre&s;s's
mother at Edmonton; and all the gentle|men
in the office went different ways.
The footman attended my mi&s;tre&s;s; and
Mrs. Gillam, her maid, always went to
<PB N="153" REF="155">
&s;ee her acquaintance, who lived at the
other end of the town, and very often
came home &s;adly out of temper becau&s;e
her place was not &s;o fine and &s;o fa&s;hionable
as their's; and then I was &s;ure to &s;uffer for
it, as indeed I did for all her ill temper
when &s;he had nobody el&s;e to vent it upon.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam! often of a Sunday in
the &s;ummer I have gone up into cur din|ing
room, becau&s;e the &s;treet was &s;o clo&s;e
and narrow that below we hardly &s;aw day
light from one end of the year to the other;
and I have opened the &s;a&s;h, and looked
again&s;t the black walls and &s;hut windows
of the hou&s;es oppo&s;ite, and have thought
how di&s;mal it was! Ah! I remembered
too well the beautiful green hills, the mea|dows
and woods, where I &s;o often u&s;ed to
ramble with my &s;i&s;ter when we were chil|dren,
in our own country, before we were
old enough to know that my poor mother
was unhappy, and had learned to weep
with her! How often have I wi&s;hed tho&s;e
days would come again, and how often
<PB N="154" REF="156">
have I &s;hut my eyes and tried to fancy I
&s;aw once more all the dear objects that
then were &s;o charming. Alas! the dream
would not la&s;t long! or if it did it &s;erved
only to make me feel more unhappy, when,
in&s;tead of being able to indulge it, I was
obliged to go back to hard, and what was
yet wor&s;e, to dirty work in our di&s;mal
kitchen. In Devon&s;hire I had been u&s;ed
to work hard enough; but I had always
fre&s;h air to breathe, and could now and
then of an evening &s;it at our cottage win|dow,
and look at the moon, and fancy
that my mother might be there with my
&s;i&s;ter, and that they &s;aw and pitied their
poor unfortunate Je&s;&s;y. Tears then re|lieved
me; and I gathered courage to bear
the next day the ill humour of my mother
in law, which now that it was over I fan|cied
was not wor&s;e than the ill humour of
Mrs. Gillam. My father's har&s;hne&s;s indeed
was wor&s;e than either, becau&s;e I loved
him, and every time he u&s;ed to &s;peak cru|elly
<PB N="155" REF="157">
to me, and &s;eem to wi&s;h me away, it
was like a dagger in my heart!"</P>
<P>The tears of the unfortunate Je&s;&s;y here
interrupted her narrative a moment, and
Cele&s;tina took occa&s;ion to &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>"But what were you going to tell me
about Mr. Cathcart? You &s;eem to have
forgotten him?"</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam!" replied &s;he with a
deep &s;igh, "I thought after I began to talk
of him, that I was doing wrong, and that
it was better not to &s;ay any more about
him: be&s;ides, Madam, though you are &s;o
good and &s;o conde&s;cending, it is not per|haps
proper for me to trouble you with all
the rea&s;ons I have to be &s;orrowful."</P>
<P>"Indeed I wi&s;h extremely to know
them," replied Cele&s;tina; "and particu|larly
I de&s;ire to know all that relates to
Mr. Cathcart. The little you have &s;aid,
has intere&s;ted me greatly."</P>
<P>"It was on the Sunday, Madam, that
I was &s;peaking of, when every body was
gone out, that poor Mr. Cathcart fir&s;t
<PB N="156" REF="158">
&s;poke to me alone. Often before that to
be &s;ure I thought he pitied me, when he
&s;aw me doing work too heavy for my
&s;trength; and often he has offered to help
me, and did not di&s;dain to a&s;&s;i&s;t me though
the footmen did; and yet I am &s;ure his
look and his manners were a great deal
more like tho&s;e of a nobleman than any
thing el&s;e. Mrs. Gillam however was al|ways
&s;o angry if &s;he &s;aw him &s;peak to, or
help me, and u&s;ed to put her&s;elf into &s;uch
pa&s;&s;ions, that he was afraid almo&s;t of look|ing
at me before her, lea&s;t it &s;hould be the
occa&s;ion of my being u&s;ed ill.</P>
<P>On the Sunday, Madam, that I was
&s;peaking of, he had fini&s;hed all my ma&s;ter
left for him to do, between &s;ix and &s;even
o'clock: for he wrote &s;uch a beautiful hand
and &s;o quick that his writing &s;eemed done
by enchantment. That day he had eat no
dinner: but a little after &s;ix o'clock he
came down into the kitchen, where I was
fitting: "Je&s;&s;y," &s;aid he, "will you
"make me &s;ome tea: I am fatigued, and I
<PB N="157" REF="159">
think it will refre&s;h me." Ah! Madam!
how plea&s;ed I was to do any thing for him.
As he &s;at on the other &s;ide of the table
drinking his tea, I looked at him, and
thought his eyes &s;eemed inflamed as if he
had been crying, and he &s;eemed more me|lancholy
than u&s;ual. "What is the mat|ter,
Mr. Cathcart?" &s;aid I, "you have
tired your&s;elf too much?"</P>
<P>"Yes, an&s;wered he, "I have been
writing a long time; but I have fini&s;hed
my bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o I never mind my head
ache." He &s;eemed de&s;irous of turning
the di&s;cour&s;e, and reaching acro&s;s to the
&s;ide of the table where I &s;at, he took up a
torn book, which, while I was &s;weeping
the clerk's office the day before, my ma&s;ter
had thrown to me, bidding me burn it, for
that he would not have &s;uch trumpery lay
about there. I never had time to read,
though my poor mother had taught me to
love it; and I had thrown this book into
a drawer, from whence I had taken it but a
moment before Mr. Cathcart came down.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160">
He enquired how I came by it, and
when I told him, a&s;ked if I had read it?
I an&s;wered that I had no time. "It is my
book," &s;aid he, &s;ighing from the bottom
of his heart as he &s;poke; "and it is the
&s;tory of a poor young man, who was as
unfortunate as I am: but he had the
re&s;olution to end his calamities; he in|deed
was not enchained to life as I mu&s;t
be. Heaven and earth!" exclaimed he,
as if at that moment oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome
idea altogether in&s;upportable, "how long
&s;hall I remain the wretch I am!"</P>
<P>He &s;tarted from his chair, and walked
about the room with looks &s;o wild that I
was terrified to death: I went to him trem|bling,
and be&s;ought him to be calm, to
tell me if I could do any thing for him:
he looked eagerly at me a moment and
bur&s;t into tears&mdash;"Ah! Je&s;&s;y," cried he,
"you pity me, and all the return I make
is to terrify and di&s;tre&s;s you!" For a mo|ment
Madam, after this gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion,
he became calmer, and &s;at down; then as
<PB N="159" REF="161">
I &s;tood &s;till trembling by him, he took
my hands within his and put them to his
burning forehead and eyes; but after a
moment &s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, he
&s;ighed, let them go, and &s;aid&mdash;"I hardly
know, Je&s;&s;y, what ailed me ju&s;t now; but
I was &s;o tired, my &s;pirits were &s;o ex|hau&s;ted
by having been &s;o long at the
de&s;k employed in &s;uch tedious kind of
writing, that when I looked at you&mdash;when
you &s;eemed concerned for me&mdash;I
am &s;o little u&s;ed to meet any friendly
looks here, that your pity affected me
&s;trangely; I felt ju&s;t then how terrible,
how very terrible my fate was; and
this proud rebellious heart, un&s;ubdued
yet to my cruel de&s;tiny, deprived me for
a moment of my rea&s;on."</P>
<P>Thank God, replied I, you are now
ea&s;ier: indeed you did &s;adly frighten me.
Tell me, dear Mr. Cathcart, why did you
talk &s;o, and why are you &s;o unhappy?</P>
<P>"I will tell you, Je&s;&s;y," an&s;wered he,
"though you are the only per&s;on in the
<PB N="160" REF="162">
hou&s;e who ever &s;hall gue&s;s at my real &s;i|tuation.
I am unhappy:&mdash;not becau&s;e I
was born and educated a gentleman,
and am now reduced to a condition
wor&s;e than ab&s;olute &s;ervitude, but be|cau&s;e
tho&s;e I love and feel for more than
for my&s;elf are fallen with me; becau&s;e
my labour&mdash;and yet I am &s;acrificing my
life to follow it&mdash;my labour is in&s;ufficent
to &s;upport a woman, delicately brought
up, and her four infant children!"</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam! all the &s;orrow I
had ever known was nothing to the cold
death-like feeling which &s;eemed to wither
up my heart, when for the moment I
thought Mr. Cathcart was married and had
a family! I did not know at that time why
it hurt me &s;o: but I was not able to &s;peak,
while he, after remaining &s;ilent a minute,
&s;aid&mdash;"By my work to-day I have earned
a guinea more than my weekly &s;tipend:
&s;urely therefore in&s;tead of murmuring
thus, I ought rather to be thankful that
I have had power to do this, for to-mor|row
<PB N="161" REF="163">
I &s;hall receive it, and to-morrow I
&s;hall be able to carry to my Sophy and
her children &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries which they
have long wanted, but which I could
not before &s;pare money enough to pro|cure
for them, out of what I earned
weekly as the only &s;upport of us all."</P>
<P>"Poor as I am, Madam, I could not
help unlocking my tea che&s;t where I kept
my little &s;avings; and though I trembled
like a leaf as I did it, I put a guinea and
&s;ome &s;ilver, all I had, into a paper, and
carried it to him. Mr. Cathcart, &s;aid I,
pray be not offended, but take this trifle,
and make u&s;e of it for your family; they
want it more than I do, and you cannot
think how much happier it will make me
if you have it, than if I lay it out on my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Gracious God!" cried he, "this is too
much. No, my dear, generous girl, do
not imagine I will take what you have &s;o
hardly acquired. Believe me, Je&s;&s;y, this
in&s;tance of &s;en&s;ibility and kindne&s;s,
<PB N="162" REF="164">
charming as they are, only render me
more wretched. In the meane&s;t &s;ervi|tude,
in the lowe&s;t degradation, amid
the harde&s;t labour, I have found a &s;oul
&s;o much &s;uperior to tho&s;e I have met
with in poli&s;hed &s;ociety: but your form,
your manners, your &s;entiments, are not
tho&s;e of your &s;tation: &s;urely you were
not born what I now &s;ee you?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, replied I, I was: my father
is now a labourer; I have no mother; nor
any friend willing, if they are able, to do
any thing for me: but while I am able to
work I mu&s;t not, I will not be di&s;con|tented,
whatever hard&s;hips I may undergo,
if you Mr. Cathcart will but let me be
your friend. Let me &s;ee your children;
indeed I &s;hall love them; and if your lady
will give me leave I will work for them:
I can bring any thing &s;he will give me to
do home, and work in my own room in|&s;tead
of going to bed.</P>
<P>"I do not know Madam, how I was
able to &s;ay &s;o much, for I felt my heart
<PB N="163" REF="165">
throb as if it would break all the time I
was &s;peaking. Oh! Madam! I was &s;ud|denly
tran&s;ported as it were to heaven,
when Mr. Cathcart, thanking me a thou|&s;and
times for my offer, told me that the
children he &s;upported were not his own
but his &s;i&s;ter's, who&s;e hu&s;band had been
undone by the villainy of &s;ome people with
whom he had been connected in trade,
and by the wickedne&s;s of an attorney; it
is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe how I was relieved
to find he was not married! for though I
am &s;ure I &s;hould have loved his children
dearly becau&s;e they were his, yet methought
I loved them much better now."</P>
<P>Sen&s;ations &s;he had her&s;elf felt in regard
to Willoughby, now forcibly occurred to
Cele&s;tina: &s;he remained &s;ilent however,
and Je&s;&s;y went on.</P>
<P>After this time, Madam, Mr. Cathcart
took every opportunity of &s;peaking to me;
and I got leave to go out one evening,
and he took me to &s;ee this beloved and
unfortunate &s;i&s;ter. It was in one of tho&s;e
<PB N="164" REF="166">
little new hou&s;es which are run up in a road
leading from Iflington to London, that
Mr. Cathcart's family lodged: his &s;i&s;ter,
Madam, was &s;o like him, that the mo|ment
I &s;aw her I could have died for her;
and I forgot all the reluctance with which
I agreed at his earne&s;t reque&s;t to go to &s;ee
her: &s;he &s;eemed to be four or five years
older than he is, and was very pale and
thin, but &s;he had &s;uch beautiful eyes, and
hands &s;o white!&mdash;her form was &s;o graceful,
&s;o commanding, that her very plain dre&s;s,
and a clo&s;e cap, &s;uch as widow's wear,
could not disfigure her, or make her look
otherwi&s;e than like a gentlewoman. When
her brother led me in, &s;he held out her
hand to me, and begged I would &s;it down:
though in &s;uch a poor little lodging, I felt
that &s;he was &s;o much my &s;uperior that I
could not obey her without he&s;itation;
but &s;he pre&s;ently by her gracious manners
di&s;&s;ipated my fears, and I &s;at down by her
clo&s;e to a frame on which &s;he had been
working. A cradle, with a &s;leeping baby
<PB N="165" REF="167">
in it, &s;tood at her feet, by which a little
girl of three years old &s;at, as if watching
the infant, and on ha&s;&s;ocks near the win|dow
were placed two little boys, the elder
not above &s;ix years old, who were learning
their ta&s;ks. As &s;oon as my reception was
over, &s;he &s;miled on her brother with more
cheerfulne&s;s than it &s;eemed po&s;&s;ible a mo|ment
before for her countenance to a&s;&s;ume;
and de&s;ired he would a&s;&s;i&s;t her in getting
&s;ome tea for me. Cathcart went down
&s;tairs, and then &s;he entered into conver&s;a|tion
with me: "My brother," &s;aid &s;he,
has often told me how unfit you are for
the condition in which he found you,
and if I may judge by your appearance,
you certainly were not born to it. Had
my dear Frank been any other than he
is, I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed him influ|enced
by beauty; but I know that mere
per&s;onal loveline&s;s in any rank never
affected him, and many rea&s;ons induced
me, Je&s;&s;y, to con&s;ent to &s;ee you&mdash;rea&s;ons
which relate to him as well as your&s;elf.
<PB N="166" REF="168">
He has told you, Je&s;&s;y, that he was born
to pro&s;pects very different from tho&s;e
now before him&mdash;pro&s;pects which are I
fear vani&s;hed for ever. My misfortunes,
which are &s;uch as I dare not attempt to
relate to you, have extended to him:
yet does he with unexampled genero&s;ity,
give him&s;elf up to &s;ervitude, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me
and my poor children. Judge whether
&s;uch a brother is not dear to me&mdash;judge
whether I ought not to love all that he
loves, and to comply as far as po&s;&s;ible
with all his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>"I have of late &s;een with infinite pain,
that in addition to all the calamities of
indigence, a pa&s;&s;ion has &s;eized him,
which mu&s;t encrea&s;e, and may perpe|tuate,
his misfortunes, and I con&s;ented,
and even wi&s;hed to &s;ee you, that I might
fairly &s;tate to you the &s;ituation he is in,
as to circum&s;tances; in the hope&mdash;a
hope in which I tru&s;t I &s;hall not be de|ceived,
that your good &s;en&s;e, and even
your regard for him, will lead you to
<PB N="167" REF="169">
avoid an error &s;o &s;educing as that of be|coming
his wife."</P>
<P>"I do not knew Madam, how I looked
at that moment, but I believe Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
thought I &s;hould faint, for &s;he
gave me immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance by opening
the window, fetched me a gla&s;s of water,
and very earne&s;tly entreated me to try to
recover my&s;elf before her brother returned.
I &s;hould be too tedious, Madam, were I to
relate all that pa&s;&s;ed even in the few mi|nutes
we were together afterwards. I found
that Cathcart's regard for me was &s;uch,
that he was willing to forget what he had
once been, and what he might &s;till be,
and to unite him&s;elf for ever with the
poor and humble Je&s;&s;y. Ah! Madam,
had it not been for Mrs. Elphin&s;tone's
&s;ake, who with her children had no other
dependence, I &s;hould have feared no po|verty,
no di&s;tre&s;s with him; but &s;hould
have been too happy to have begged round
the world with him: as it was, I &s;aw that
I ought not to think a moment of a mar|riage,
<PB N="168" REF="170">
which would at be&s;t only encrea&s;e
his difficulties. Oh! how I then wi&s;hed
that my grandfather were le&s;s cruel, my
poor father le&s;s imprudent!</P>
<P>"After this fir&s;t interview with Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone, I &s;aw her whenever I could
get leave to go out, which was not indeed
very often: but my ma&s;ter, who did not
want humanity, &s;eeing me look dreadfully
ill, ordered Mrs. Gillam to let me go out
whenever &s;he could &s;pare me, for air.
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, who watched every alter|ation
of my countenance, gue&s;&s;ed at all I &s;uf|fered;
and at length &s;he became &s;o fond of
me, that &s;he rather de&s;ired than oppo&s;ed the
completion of her brother's wi&s;hes. The
&s;truggle I underwent nearly co&s;t me my
life: but at length, Madam, I have left
them both. I could not bear to &s;ee my
dear Cathcart every day more and more
unhappy: I could not bear to become a
burthen to him: for &s;ome time I redoubled
my diligence, and exerted my&s;elf greatly
beyond my &s;trength, from a hope, that by
<PB N="169" REF="171">
becoming nece&s;&s;ary to my mi&s;tre&s;s, I
&s;hould obtain an encrea&s;e of wages, out of
which I thought it po&s;&s;ible that I might
be able to &s;ave &s;omething; but the upper
&s;ervant took pains to render all my endea|vours
ineffectual; and my health declined
&s;o rapidly under the labour and anxiety I
endured, that Cathcart, who&s;e unea&s;ine&s;s
compleated the mea&s;ure of my &s;ufferings,
at length propo&s;ed that I &s;hould quit my
&s;ervice, as the only means of &s;aving my
life, and try what my native air would do
to re&s;tore me.</P>
<P>"I hope my father will receive me
without unkindne&s;s, and &s;uffer me to &s;tay
till I am able to take another &s;ervice; and
&s;ometimes I am willing to flatter my&s;elf
that my grandfather may relent, though it
is more po&s;&s;ible than probable."</P>
<P>"And where," enquired Cele&s;tina,
"have you left your lover?"</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam," replied the weeping
Je&s;&s;y, "he &s;till remains writing for the
exi&s;tence of his &s;i&s;ter and her children: at
<PB N="170" REF="172">
his pen from early morning, to eleven or
twelve at night. By &s;uch a&s;&s;iduous appli|cation
he is enabled indeed to earn double
the money he would otherwi&s;e do; but his
dear health is fa&s;t declining, and God only
knows," continued &s;he, cla&s;ping her hands
together, "whether I &s;hall ever &s;ee him
more: but if not, one comfort, one great
comfort is, that we &s;hall not be &s;eparated
long:&mdash;in heaven nothing can part us!"</P>
<P>"Let us however hope," &s;aid Cele&s;tina,
"that your tenderne&s;s, your fortitude,
and genero&s;ity, will be rewarded on earth.
Your father then knows nothing of your
arrival?"</P>
<P>"Ah! no, Madam: I dared not write
to him, for fear he &s;hould have been angry
with me for having quitted my &s;ervice, and
have refu&s;ed to receive me. Now I hope,
when he &s;ees me &s;o &s;adly altered, for I am
not at all like what I was when I left him,
he will have &s;ome pity upon me, and &s;uf|fer
me at lea&s;t to &s;tay in his hou&s;e till I
<PB N="171" REF="173">
have &s;trength enough to undertake another
&s;ervice."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall go with me, however, to|night,"
&s;aid Cele&s;tina, "and you &s;hall &s;tay
with me till you are fitter than you now
appear to be to undergo an interview with
this cruel father."</P>
<P>The poor Je&s;&s;y, oppre&s;&s;ed by this good|ne&s;s,
could not &s;peak, but &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the
hand of her benefactre&s;s with a re&s;pectful
gratitude, and a mournful but not unplea&s;|ing
&s;adne&s;s kept the generous and &s;oft
hearted Cele&s;tina &s;ilent till their arrival at
the inn where they were to remain that
night.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY in the evening of the follow|ing
day, Cele&s;tina and her humble friend
arrived at the lodging &s;he had taken: it
was a &s;mall new built brick hou&s;e, on the
edge of an exten&s;ive common: enclo&s;ures
at a di&s;tance relieved a little the dreary
uniformity of the view from it's windows,
and a village church, with a few &s;traggling
hou&s;es &s;cattered round the edge of the
heath at the di&s;tance of about half a mile,
gave &s;ome relief to the eye, and &s;ome in|timation
of an inhabited country: winter
had alike dive&s;ted the common of it's
furze and heath blo&s;&s;oms, and the few
elms on it's borders, of their foliage. All
was alike dull, and unplea&s;ant: but Ce|le&s;tina
remembered that &s;he had now
<PB N="173" REF="175">
e&s;caped from the Ca&s;tlenorths, from the
&s;ight of preparations for Willoughby's mar|riage,
and that if &s;he was not to live to
&s;ee him happy, &s;he &s;hould not now witne&s;s
his &s;truggles and his di&s;tre&s;s: &s;he tried to
believe that &s;he could receive intelligence
of his marriage with compo&s;ure, and be
glad in the reflection that he had obeyed
his mother; but her heart revolted, and all
&s;he could promi&s;e her&s;elf was, to exert her
re&s;olution to obtain &s;uch a &s;tate of mind,
as might enable her to hear, without very
acute angui&s;h, of an event, which, notwith|&s;tanding
all that had pa&s;&s;ed at her la&s;t in|terview
with Willoughby, &s;he &s;till con&s;i|dered
as inevitable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day after her arrival was pa&s;&s;ed
in &s;ettling her&s;elf in her new habitation
by the aid of Je&s;&s;y, who helped her to
arrange her books and her wardrobe. The
pen&s;ive &s;implicity of her new friend's cha|racter
won upon her every hour; and now,
deprived as &s;he was of all her former con|nections,
and of every pro&s;pect of happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="174" REF="176">
for her&s;elf, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of no
other plea&s;ure than what aro&s;e from the
power of &s;oothing the &s;orrows of her un|fortunate
companion, and forming &s;chemes
for re&s;toring her to the favour of her grand|father;
and to her unhappy lover, in who&s;e
fate &s;he became as much intere&s;ted from
the artle&s;s de&s;cription Je&s;&s;y had given, as
if &s;he had her&s;elf known him. It was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
however to part with her: but as
&s;he appeared in too weak a &s;tate of health
to encounter the rude reception &s;he might
meet with from her father and her mother
in law, if &s;he appeared before them with|out
notice, Cele&s;tina thought it be&s;t to
keep her till an an&s;wer could be obtained
from them, and &s;he therefore hired a me&s;|&s;enger,
by whom the letter the trembling
Je&s;&s;y indited was di&s;patched to the cottage
of Woodburn, which was about &s;even
miles di&s;tant. Towards evening he re|turned,
and brought a reluctant and &s;urly
con&s;ent from her father to receive her for
a little time till &s;he recovered her health.
<PB N="175" REF="177">
The terms in which this an&s;wer was written,
though Cele&s;tina endeavoured to give
them the be&s;t interpretation &s;he could, were
cruelly painful to poor Je&s;&s;y, who wept
over the letter, while Cele&s;tina, with the
mo&s;t generous pity, a&s;&s;ured her, that if
her father's behaviour to her was unkind,
and her &s;tay at his hou&s;e uncomfortable,
&s;he would again receive her, and that &s;he
&s;hould be welcome to remain with her till
her health was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and till means
could be found to procure for her the fa|vour
of her grandfather, who, on enquiry
of her ho&s;te&s;s, Cele&s;tina found to be as
Je&s;&s;y had repre&s;ented him&mdash;a very rich
farmer, now quite &s;uperannuated, and al|mo&s;t
childi&s;h; who having once determined
to re&s;ent his daughter's marriage, had per|&s;i&s;ted
in it from the hard ob&s;tinacy of his
nature, and had been &s;upported in it by
the arts of an old female relation who lived
with him, and who, while &s;he made a
pur&s;e every year out of what was entru&s;ted
to her, looked forward with avidity to his
<PB N="176" REF="178">
death, when &s;he hoped to po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole.
Cele&s;tina procured an hor&s;e and a man to
lead it, the expence of which &s;he paid
her&s;elf, and on the third day after their
arrival at Thorpe Heath, Je&s;&s;y took leave
of her lovely and generous benefactre&s;s,
who was now left to reflect, without inter|ruption,
on her own de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>Till lately &s;he had not been con&s;cious
of the force of her attachment to Willough|by;
for it began &s;o early in life, that &s;he
had never been alarmed by the unea&s;ine&s;s
which &s;eizes the heart on it's fir&s;t reception
of a new pa&s;&s;ion: &s;he now however found
that her exi&s;tence had been delightful to
her, only as his idea had mingled it&s;elf
with every hour of it, and that now, when
&s;he believed &s;he ought no longer to in|dulge
her&s;elf in thinking of him, &s;he could
think of nothing el&s;e with either intere&s;t or
plea&s;ure: the benevolence and tenderne&s;s
of her heart &s;till afforded her &s;ome &s;atis|faction,
while &s;he could exert it in favour
of the unfortunate, and the power of be|friending
<PB N="177" REF="179">
friending the de&s;olate and unhappy Je&s;&s;y
had called off her attention a little from
her own unea&s;y feelings; but now, having
done all &s;he could at pre&s;ent do for her,
her heart was again &s;en&s;ible of the cruel
deprivation to which &s;he was condemned,
and her mind occupied in reflecting on
what Willoughby would think, what he
would &s;ay, when he learned &s;he was gone;
in conjectures on his behaviour to the
Ca&s;tlenorths, and in trembling &s;olicitude
whether he would write to her, or without
any farther indulgence of an attachment,
which he knew he ought not to cheri&s;h,
drive her from his recollection, at lea&s;t
till he had obeyed the injunctions of his
mother, and by compleating the marriage
&s;he had in&s;i&s;ted upon, put it out of his
power to think of Cele&s;tina otherwi&s;e than
as his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Two or three days pa&s;&s;ed thus, before
Cele&s;tina could acquire in any degree her
u&s;ual &s;erenity, and &s;it down to her books,
her drawing, or her work. By mu&s;ic,
<PB N="178" REF="180">
which &s;he now fancied would &s;ooth and
calm her &s;pirits, &s;he could not amu&s;e her|&s;elf;
for though &s;he had a plano forte which
u&s;ed to be called her's, yet, as it had ne|ver
been formally given to her, and as
Mrs. Molyneux had not mentioned it,
Cele&s;tina would not take it on her quitting
London. At length the fir&s;t unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tions
on her change of &s;ituation a little &s;ub|&s;ided,
and &s;he began to con&s;ider of a letter
which &s;he thought it indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary
to write to Mrs. Molyneux.</P>
<P>In the mean time the ardent and eager
temper of Willoughby exhibited in London
a &s;cene, which, could Cele&s;tina have known,
it would have redoubled all her anxiety.
The dinner of which he had been with diffi|culty
induced to partake at Lord Ca&s;tle|north's,
had &s;erved only to fill him with new
and invincible di&s;gu&s;t towards the whole fa|mily,
and hardly could he command him&s;elf
&s;o as not to betray it. The re&s;traint, however,
which, in con&s;ideration of their relation&s;hip
to his mother, he determined, whatever it
<PB N="179" REF="181">
co&s;t him, to put upon his &s;entiments, gave
to two of the per&s;ons concerned a favour|able
impre&s;&s;ion of him: Lord Ca&s;tlenorth,
fond of form, and of that re&s;erve which he
fancied &s;upported dignity, liked his ne|phew
the better he &s;aid for not a&s;&s;uming
the familiar and too ea&s;y manners, &s;o di&s;|agreeable
to him in the behaviour of mo&s;t
of the young men he &s;aw; and Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
who liked his per&s;on better on
every interview, and who never could for
a moment &s;uppo&s;e that any man could be|hold
her's with indifference, imputed to
re&s;pect and admiration that di&s;tant polite|ne&s;s
which was intended to conceal aver|&s;ion.
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, however, who
had &s;een more of the world than her daugh|ter,
and had not the &s;ame prejudices as
her hu&s;band, was by no means plea&s;ed
with the ob&s;ervations &s;he made in the
cour&s;e of the day, nor with the plea&s;ure &s;he
&s;aw for the fir&s;t time in the eyes of Wil|loughby
when the moment of their depar|ture
arrived. This was not till four in the
<PB N="180" REF="182">
morning. The late hour of dinner, and
the parties which were made for cards,
brought on a &s;upper at near two, of which
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth &s;eemed to expect her
gue&s;ts would partake: they &s;taid there|fore;
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth retiring early, by
the advice of Mrs. Calder; and the uni|ver&s;atility
of Lady Ca&s;tlenorth's knowledge
being di&s;played the whole time to the ex|treme
fatigue of Willoughby, and by no
means to the &s;atisfaction of his &s;i&s;ter, who
found in her aunt a de&s;ire to monopolize
not only all the conver&s;ation, but the at|tention
of every man pre&s;ent, to whom
&s;he contrived to addre&s;s her&s;elf by turns,
and with whom &s;he appeared immediately
offended, if Mrs. Molyneux, whom &s;he
con&s;idered and treated as a pretty automa|ton,
attracted even for a moment any of
that admiration that &s;he was generally, at
her own parties and among her own friends,
accu&s;tomed to engro&s;s.</P>
<P>Willoughby was &s;et down by his &s;i&s;ter
at his own lodgings, and Mrs. Molyneux
<PB N="181" REF="183">
her&s;elf knew nothing of Cele&s;tina's depar|ture
till breakfa&s;t the next day; when bu|&s;ied
with preparations for a ball &s;ub&s;cribed
for by &s;ome noblemen of her acquaintance,
&s;he li&s;tened to the information hardly
knowing &s;he received it, and te&s;tified no
other concern than by &s;aying coldly&mdash;"I
wi&s;h &s;he had &s;taid till to-morrow, for &s;he
has really &s;omething of a ta&s;te, and I
&s;hould have liked to have had her here
when I dre&s;s." This important dre&s;s, how|ever,
was too momentous to &s;uffer her to
think long of any human being; and
when her brother called upon her about
three o'clock, &s;he was adju&s;ting the orna|ments
on a tiara of her own invention, and
had forgotten for the moment not only the
&s;udden journey of Cele&s;tina but Cele&s;tina
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Willoughby &s;at down by her; and in
hopes of Cele&s;tina's coming in, entered
into conver&s;ation on frivolous &s;ubjects, to
which he in fact gave &s;o little attention
that he hardly heard the an&s;wers his &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="182" REF="184">
gave him. He de&s;ired, however, to pro|long
the time of his &s;tay as much as po&s;&s;i|ble,
that without a&s;king for Cele&s;tina, he
might &s;ee her; and he knew, that bu&s;ied
as Mrs. Molyneux was, he &s;hould have
an opportunity of &s;peaking to her without
ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The tiara was at length ornamented,
and no Cele&s;tina appeared: Willoughby
then enquired why &s;he did not a&s;&s;i&s;t at an
operation &s;o important, and heard with
pain and amazement that &s;he had left the
hou&s;e at five o'clock that morning.</P>
<P>"And whither is &s;he gone?" &s;aid he
in a voice hardly audible: "and how
could you &s;uffer her to go?"</P>
<P>"Oh! as to that," an&s;wered Mrs. Mo|lyneux,
quite regardle&s;s of his di&s;tre&s;s,
"&s;he has taken tho&s;e lodgings you know
in Devon&s;hire that you have &s;o often heard
her &s;peak of; and for her going, you know
&s;he has long determined on it, and indeed
I did not oppo&s;e it, thinking as things
<PB N="183" REF="185">
are, it was the very be&s;t re&s;olution &s;he
could take."</P>
<P>"As things are!" repeated Willoughby,
trying vainly to &s;tifle the painful &s;en&s;ation
his &s;i&s;ter's coldne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility gave
him: "I know not, Mrs. Molyneux,
what you mean exactly, but&mdash;"</P>
<P>He was proceeding, when the hair dre&s;&s;er,
who on the&s;e great occa&s;ions was employed
in preference to her own maid, was an|nounced;
and Mrs. Molyneux, ordering
him into her powdering room, walked im|mediately
away, and le&s;t Willoughby &s;it|ting
like a &s;tatue by the dre&s;&s;ing table &s;he
had left.</P>
<P>He remained there near a quarter of an
hour, in a &s;tate of mind difficult to be de|&s;cribed:
the danger to which Cele&s;tina
mu&s;t be expo&s;ed, alone and unprotected;
the probability of his lo&s;ing her for ever;
nay of her &s;acrificing her&s;elf to &s;ome of
tho&s;e pretenders whom he doubted not
her beauty would attract, in the &s;ame &s;pirit
of di&s;intere&s;ted heroi&s;m, as that which had
<PB N="184" REF="186">
determined her to quit London: the ex|ce&s;&s;ive
tenderne&s;s he was con&s;cious of
towards her, again&s;t which he found every
hour the impo&s;&s;ibility of contending, and
the encrea&s;ing di&s;gu&s;t that he felt in con|templating
the chains he had promi&s;ed to
put on, all contributed to overwhelm his
mind with angui&s;h, from which he &s;aw
not how it was ea&s;y or even po&s;&s;ible to
e&s;cape.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t idea was to obtain a direction
to Cele&s;tina, and follow her immediately;
but he knew the delicacy of her mind, and
he felt perfectly what was due to her &s;itua|tion:&mdash;reflections
which checked tho&s;e in|tentions
almo&s;t as &s;oon as they were formed;
and before he could decide on what he
ought to do, he received from Molyneux,
who had ju&s;t come in and gone out again,
an un&s;ealed note, containing the&s;e lines:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

</LETTER>
<P>This note, &s;o peremptorily requiring
what the writer knew Willoughby could
not obtain but by ha&s;tily confirming tho&s;e
mea&s;ures which were &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to him;
this unfeeling precipitation, which ap|peared
only a fine&s;&s;e to compel him to
plunge into them, rou&s;ed Willoughby from
the &s;tate of undetermined anxiety he had
been in, into anger and indignation: his
fir&s;t &s;olicitude however was to rai&s;e in|&s;tantly
<PB N="186" REF="188">
the five hundred pounds for that
evening's play, which was clearly the
meaning of his brother in law; and &s;natch|ing
up his hat, he left the hou&s;e, deter|mining,
in the fir&s;t emotions of his re&s;ent|ment,
to enter it no more. He took his
way towards the city, and applying to a
banker in Lombard-&s;treet, in who&s;e hands
his father had kept his money, and who
had had con&s;iderable advantages by his
own affairs during his minority, he obtained,
not without &s;olicitation the mo&s;t painful
to his pride and on terms as hard as
would have been demanded by a common
money lender, the &s;um he wanted; which
he enclo&s;ed in a cover, and &s;ent by one of
the clerks, with the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"Mr. Willoughby enclo&s;es to Mr.
Molyneux the &s;um for which he has &s;o
pre&s;&s;ing an occa&s;ion, and a&s;&s;ures him
he will lo&s;e no time in procuring the
re&s;t, that all pecuniary tran&s;actions may
be at an end between them."</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189">
It was with great difficulty he bridled
the natural vehemence of his temper, and
forbore to expre&s;s with bitterne&s;s the di&s;|plea&s;ure
Molyneux's proceeding had given
him. More re&s;olute than ever not to be
dictated to by his brother in law, and de|te&s;ting
more than before the marriage
which was thus intended to be forced
upon him, di&s;&s;atisfied with every idea
that occurred to him, and having no friend
in London to whom he could open his
oppre&s;&s;ed heart, he determined at length
to procure a direction to Cele&s;tina, and re|turning
immediately to Cambridge him|&s;elf,
con&s;ult a friend he had there, on
who&s;e judgment and attachment he had
an equal reliance, how he &s;hould avoid an
alliance with the woman he dete&s;ted and
the hazard he now incurred of lo&s;ing the
woman he adored.</P>
<P>He &s;ent therefore a &s;ervant, as &s;oon as
he returned to his lodgings, to procure
from the &s;ervants of Molyneux a copy of
the direction that had been put on the
<PB N="188" REF="190">
trunks &s;ent to Cele&s;tina. This being ob|tained,
he ordered a po&s;t chai&s;e, and late
as it was, and without giving any account
of him&s;elf either to his &s;i&s;ter or the Ca&s;tle|norths,
he &s;et out for Cambridge, and ar|rived
at his college about four in the morn|ing
of the next day.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter arrived a day after Willough|by's
abrupt departure. Between the conti|nual
and uncea&s;ing hurry in which &s;he
lived, and her vexation at that event, &s;he
hardly read it, but threw it carele&s;sly by
on her toilet, where it remained forgotten
like the writer of it.</P>
<P>On the day Willoughby had dined and
&s;upped in Gro&s;venor-&s;treet, the whole fa|mily
had been much di&s;&s;atisfied with his con|duct,
<PB N="192" REF="194">
except his uncle; who retaining much
of form and ceremony in his own manners,
was willing to impute his coldne&s;s to re|&s;pect,
and his di&s;tant civility to veneration:
but the mother and daughter were by no
means content with his deportment; and
though they concealed their feelings as it
were by mutual con&s;ent, their pride was
equally alarmed, and both re&s;olved to have
an early explanation</P>
<P>Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, however, who&s;e policy
only had power to re&s;train awhile the
ebullitions of her wounded pride, waited one
day in hopes that Willoughby would in a fa|mily
conference te&s;tify more ardour for the
match than he had done in mixed company;
but Willoughby never appeared; and her
indignation now knowing no bounds, &s;he
ordered her coach, and on the next, &s;talked
with more than u&s;ual maje&s;ty into the
dre&s;&s;ing room of Mrs. Molyneux ju&s;t as
&s;he had fini&s;hed her breakfa&s;t, which was,
owing to the hour on which &s;he went to
<PB N="193" REF="195">
bed the preceding morning, even later
than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Lady Ca&s;tlenorth hardly &s;poke to Mrs.
Molyneux when &s;he entered, but demanded
in an imperious tone what was become of
Mr. Willoughby.</P>
<P>The lady to whom &s;he thus abruptly
addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf was as haughty and of as
high con&s;equence in her own e&s;timation as
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth her&s;elf; and feeling and
re&s;enting her rude and peremptory &s;tile,
&s;he an&s;wered, with almo&s;t as little complai|&s;ance
in her manner, that &s;he knew not.</P>
<P>"You don't know, Madam!" ex|claimed
the imperious Vi&s;counte&s;s; "you
don't know! Very extraordinary &s;urely.
What am I to under&s;tand from all this?"</P>
<P>"Of that al&s;o I am ignorant," replied
Mrs. Molyneux. "Mr. Willoughby,
Madam, is his own ma&s;ter; and I really
can no more account for than direct his
actions,"</P>
<P>"A&s;toni&s;hing!" re-a&s;&s;umed Lady Ca&s;|tlenorth;
"that a man &s;ituated as he is,
<PB N="194" REF="196">
who is not an ab&s;olute ideot, &s;hould he|have
in this manner in an affair on which
his very exi&s;tence as a man of fa&s;hion de|pends:
but don't imagine, Mi&s;tre&s;s Moly|neux,
that <HI>my</HI> daughter&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Dear Madam," interrupted Matilda,
irritated by the &s;upercilious and in&s;olent
tone in which her Lady&s;hip &s;poke, and
particularly the empha&s;is &s;he put on the
word Mi&s;tre&s;s, "I beg and entreat that you
will &s;pare your anger. I at lea&s;t cannot
de&s;erve it, for I have no influence over
my brother. I dare &s;ay he has &s;ome rea|&s;ons
for having left London &s;o abruptly,
though I a&s;&s;ure you I do not know them."</P>
<P>"You don't!&mdash;I do: he is gone after that
creature, whom your mother, to her utter
di&s;grace, brought up in the family, and
with whom &s;he &s;uffered her &s;on to live in
habits of intimacy which &s;hock me every
time I think of it."</P>
<P>At this moment Mr. Molyneux entered
with a letter in his hand, and hardly in his
ha&s;te noticing Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, he told
<PB N="195" REF="197">
his wife that the letter was that in&s;tant deli|vered
to him by an expre&s;s, that his father
was dying, and that they mu&s;t immediately
&s;et out for Ireland at his earne&s;t entreaty.
"Ha&s;ten therefore," &s;aid he, "to pre|pare
your&s;elf, for the chai&s;e I have &s;ent for
will be at the door in a moment. Your
Lady&s;hip will excu&s;e us I am &s;ure on &s;uch
an occa&s;ion," added he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf
to Lady Ca&s;tlenorth. "Matilda, we have
not a moment to lo&s;e: direct your maid
to prepare what you want to take with you,
and to follow her&s;elf with the baggage that
may not be &s;o immediately nece&s;&s;ary."</P>
<P>"And where is Willoughby?" cried
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, rai&s;ing her voice: "I
in&s;i&s;t upon &s;eeing him."</P>
<P>"I believe he has left London," an|&s;wered
Molyneux; "but I a&s;&s;ure you I
know not whither he is gone. I dare &s;ay
your Lady&s;hip will &s;oon hear of him. In
the mean time pray pardon me; it is im|po&s;&s;ible
for me now to have the honour of
attending you."</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="198">
He then left the room, as his wife had
done already; and Lady Ca&s;tlenorth,
bur&s;ting with anger and indignation which
&s;he had nobody to li&s;ten to, returned in
all the fury of mortified pride to her own
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>While &s;he was there meditating how to
revenge the neglect &s;hewn to her daughter,
of which &s;he now no longer doubted, Wil|loughby
was pouring out all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es
of his heart to a friend whom heaven &s;eemed
to have &s;ent him for their alleviation.</P>
<P>Mr. Vava&s;our, his mo&s;t intimate friend,
had been ab&s;ent when he left Cambridge
on his ha&s;ty and reluctant journey to Lon|don,
but was now returned, and to him
Willoughby immediately di&s;clo&s;ed the
cau&s;e of that unea&s;ine&s;s which his friend
perceived he &s;uffered under even before he
&s;poke.</P>
<P>"What &s;hall I do?" &s;aid he, as he
leaned on the table, "how extricate my|&s;elf
from the mo&s;t in&s;upportable of en|gagements?
how &s;atisfy this narrow and un|feeling
<PB N="197" REF="199">
Molyneux? my &s;oul revolts from
the odious nece&s;&s;ity of being obliged to
him for forbearance: yet to &s;ell my e&s;tates&mdash;is
more painful to me than any mea&s;ure
but marrying Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman. Yet my
promi&s;e, my a&s;&s;urances to my mother&mdash;I
&s;ee not how I can e&s;cape from the diffi|culties
that encompa&s;s me."</P>
<P>"You make more of them &s;urely, my
dear George," replied Vava&s;our, "than is
nece&s;&s;ary. What! &s;hould either a promi&s;e
or an exigence compel you to be mi&s;erable
for life; then indeed there would be no
e&s;cape: but now, &s;urely, my friend, your
e&s;cape is not difficult."</P>
<P>"Were you &s;ituated as I am then, how
would you act?"</P>
<P>"Why I would without he&s;itation de|clare
off with the woman I did not like, and
marry the woman I did: that is, if I were
di&s;po&s;ed to marry at all."</P>
<P>"And would you do this, Vava&s;our,
contrary to a &s;olemn promi&s;e given to her
who cannot now relea&s;e me from it? and
<PB N="198" REF="200">
then how can I act in regard to Molyneux?
be the con&s;equence what it will he &s;hall
never again dun me for money, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Never!" interrupted Vava&s;our warmly,
"if you will li&s;ten to me. I am not quite
of age it is true, but my fortune is &s;uch,
that nothing is ea&s;ier than for me to rai&s;e
this paltry five thou&s;and pounds, or twice the
&s;um, on no very exorbitant terms. I have
already taken up money for my own plea|&s;ures,
and &s;hall I he&s;itate when my friend
has real occa&s;ion for it? In a week's time
the money &s;hall be ready for you. Pray
then let us hear no more of any difficulties
of that &s;ort, and as for your promi&s;e&mdash;the
good lady, when &s;he extorted it, could never
think it binding."</P>
<P>"Speak not lightly of her, my dear
friend," cried Willoughby, "that I may
feel all the kindne&s;s of the former part of
your &s;peech without alloy: &s;he was a wo|man
whom, had you known, you would
have reverenced and loved, and it was in
<PB N="199" REF="201">
kindne&s;s only that &s;he made me give her
an engagement&mdash;"</P>
<P>"To make your&s;elf mi&s;erable. I am,
you know, George, an Epicurean; you are
&s;omewhat of a Stoic I &s;uppo&s;e; and if that
is the ca&s;e, fulfil your promi&s;e, take your
heire&s;s, and philo&s;ophize at your lei&s;ure. I
have never &s;een your Cele&s;tina, you know;
but from your de&s;cription of her, and your
long attachment, I &s;hould pity you&mdash;I am
afraid I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e you&mdash;I am &s;ure I
&s;hould not love you&mdash;were you to &s;acrifice
&s;uch a creature to any pecuniary con&s;idera|tions.
Come, my dear fellow, a&s;&s;ure
your&s;elf that if five thou&s;and pounds or
more will relieve you from what weighs
on your &s;pirits about Molyneux's matter,
it is your's; the other affair you mu&s;t &s;ettle
with your own heart, and I leave you to ar|gue
it together."</P>
<P>Vava&s;our then quitted the room; and
Willoughby, relea&s;ed from his anxiety
about his debt by the genero&s;ity of his
friend, gave him&s;elf up to all tho&s;e plea|&s;ant
<PB N="200" REF="202">
images which pre&s;ented them&s;elves to
his mind. To be united immediately with
Cele&s;tina, to carry her down to Alve&s;tone,
and there to enter on a plan of oeconomy
which &s;hould in a very few years retrieve
his circum&s;tances, was a vi&s;ion which he
found &s;o much delight in cheri&s;hing, that
he drove from his mind as much as po&s;&s;ible
the painful objections that &s;till cruelly in|truded
them&s;elves to de&s;troy it: the con|ver&s;ation
of Vava&s;our helped to put
them entirely to flight; and Willoughby,
per&s;uaded that by the projects of oeconomy
he had formed he &s;hould &s;oon be enabled
to pay his friend the money &s;o generou&s;ly
offered him, agreed without much he&s;ita|tion
to accept it. The young men then
&s;ettled that they would go the next day
but one to London, &s;tay there long enough
to negociate this bu&s;ine&s;s, and then go
down together to Alve&s;tone, from whence
Willoughby, who had no inclination to
encounter Lady Ca&s;tlenorth per&s;onally,
determined to write to his uncle, re&s;igning
<PB N="201" REF="203">
all preten&s;ions to the honor intended him,
and immediately to complete his marriage
with her who had &s;o long been mi&s;tre&s;s of
his heart. This arrangement, once made,
became every moment more &s;educing to
his imagination; &s;till the words of his mo|ther,
the &s;olemn charge given him with
her la&s;t breath, returned now and then to
di&s;turb his vi&s;ionary felicity: but Cele&s;|tina,
always &s;o lovely in his eyes, leaning
on his arm amid the &s;hades of Alve&s;tone,
the delight of all who beheld her, the ad|miration
of his friends, the patrone&s;s of
his tenants, the protectre&s;s of the poor,
was an image &s;o deliciou&s;ly &s;oothing to
his fancy, that by indulging it he at
length per&s;uaded him&s;elf that his mother,
who had &s;o very tenderly loved her, would,
could &s;he be &s;en&s;ible of all the happine&s;s
they &s;hould &s;hare together, applaud his
violation of his promi&s;e and &s;anction his
choice.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, gay, generous, open hearted,
and volatile, always eagerly following him|&s;elf
<PB N="202" REF="204">
his own inclinations, and as warmly
&s;olicitous for his friend's gratification as his
own, encouraged as much as po&s;&s;ible all
tendency in Willoughby to throw off any
adherence to what he deemed tyranny be|yond
the grave; and by the time the ne|gociation
for the loan was completed,
which took them up near a week, Wil|loughby
had no longer any &s;cruples remain|ing.
His only bu&s;ine&s;s in town then was
to pay Molyneux, who&s;e conduct had of|fended
him &s;o much that he had not been
to the hou&s;e: as &s;oon however as the mo|ney
was ready, he wrote a note to his bro|ther
in law, &s;ignifying that he would on
the next day meet him at his attorney's
chambers to &s;ettle all accounts between
them. The &s;ervant who was &s;ent brought
the note back; and Willoughby then fir&s;t
learning that his &s;i&s;ter and her hu&s;band
were embarked for Ireland, depo&s;ited the
money at a banker's, and wrote a cold let|ter
to Molyneux, &s;ignifying that it waited
his orders. He then gave directions to
<PB N="203" REF="205">
his own &s;olicitor to take proper receipts on
the payment of it, and with Vava&s;our
ha&s;tened down to Alve&s;tone, in the neigh|bourhood
of which place he knew Cele&s;|tina
was; but he had determined not to
&s;ee her till he had obviated every
objection &s;he could make to his plan of
happine&s;s, by breaking at once and for
ever with the Ca&s;tlenorths; a ta&s;k on which,
re&s;olved as he was to execute it, he could
not think without a mixture of concern
and apprehen&s;ion that he was a&s;hamed of
feeling, and dared by no means betray to
his friend Vava&s;our; who, without knowing
any thing of the Ca&s;tlenorths him&s;elf, had
made up his mind that they were an odious
and di&s;agreeable &s;et, and from &s;uch, what|ever
might be their rank, he always flew
away him&s;elf, and encouraged his friends
to do it at whatever ri&s;k. If he was care|le&s;s
and even rude towards tho&s;e whom he
did not wi&s;h to plea&s;e, he was altogether
as amiable and attentive to tho&s;e to whom
<PB N="204" REF="206">
he &s;ought to be acceptable. His di&s;likes
and his attachments were equally warm,
and the latter had hitherto been rather
warm than permanent.</P>

<PB N="205" REF="207">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things were pa&s;&s;ing at
Cambridge and in London, Cele&s;tina un|derwent
the cruelle&s;t anxiety at not hearing
from Mrs. Molyneux; but all her conjec|tures
ended in the painful conclu&s;ion that
the preparations and celebration of Wil|loughby's
marriage entirely engaged her,
and prevented her writing. All her rea|&s;on
was now &s;ummoned to &s;upport her
again&s;t the &s;hock which the certainty of
this event would give her. With a beat|ing
heart, and in breathle&s;s agitation, &s;he
ran over the paper which once a week a
travelling new&s;man brought from Exeter,
and where &s;he knew the marriage of a
man of &s;o much con&s;equence in the neigh|bourhood
would not fail to be in&s;erted.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208">
No &s;uch intelligence however appeared;
and Cele&s;tina, imagining that the marriage
had notwith&s;tanding certainly taken place,
endeavoured, &s;ince &s;he could not conquer
her regret, to divert it, by trying what
&s;he could do towards &s;oftening the &s;or|rows
and relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the
unfortunate Je&s;&s;y, who&s;e patient endurance
of evils, evidently &s;everer than her own,
who&s;e fortitude in tearing her&s;elf perhaps
for ever from the man &s;he loved, and &s;a|crificing
the indulgence of her affection
to his intere&s;t, made Cele&s;tina &s;ometimes
a&s;hamed of the murmurs &s;he found excited
in her heart by le&s;s inconveniences, and
blu&s;h at the reluctance with which &s;he had
&s;ubmitted to the lo&s;s of a man, who&s;e regard
for her &s;eemed already to have yielded to
the influence of pecuniary advantage, and
family convenience.</P>
<P>But in de&s;pite of every argument &s;he
could bring to &s;ubdue the pain ari&s;ing
from the recollection of lo&s;t happine&s;s, and
totally &s;ilence the Syren voice of hope which
<PB N="207" REF="209">
now and then pre&s;ented the po&s;&s;ibility of
more favourable days, the uncertainty whe|ther
the event to which &s;he laboured to be|come
reconciled had really happened,
di&s;turbed and rendered her re&s;tle&s;s and
unea&s;y. Je&s;&s;y, to whom &s;he now &s;ent to
de&s;ire her company for a little time, joy|fully
accepted the &s;ummons; and in her
company Cele&s;tina felt great &s;atisfaction,
though &s;he had never di&s;clo&s;ed to her any
part of the &s;orrow that oppre&s;&s;ed her, or
given the remote&s;t hint of her attachment
to Willoughby. All the indulgence &s;he
allowed her&s;elf was, that of &s;ometimes
chu&s;ing to walk towards a knoll at the
extremity of the common, which afforded
an exten&s;ive view towards the we&s;t; from
thence, by the help of a tele&s;cope lent her
by her landlord, Cele&s;tina had di&s;covered
a clump of firs in Alve&s;tone Park; and
though they were near ten miles di&s;tant,
and without a gla&s;s appeared only a dark
&s;pot above the re&s;t of the land&s;cape, &s;he
found a melancholy plea&s;ure in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
<PB N="208" REF="210">
them, and would frequently, as
&s;he leant on Je&s;&s;y's arm in their pen&s;ive
rambles, fix her eyes on that di&s;tant ob|ject,
gaze on it &s;teadily for two or three
minutes, and then with a deep &s;igh turn
away, and walk &s;ilently home.</P>
<P>She encouraged however the artle&s;s
Je&s;&s;y to talk to her of Cathcart; and the
poor girl, plea&s;ed with every opportunity
of repeating his name, and flattered by the
tender intere&s;t Cele&s;tina took in their
&s;tory, was never weary of &s;peaking of him.
She at length acquired confidence enough
to produce &s;ome of the letters he wrote to
her; and Cele&s;tina, who had very natu|rally
imputed much of the prai&s;e Je&s;&s;y had
be&s;towed on his writing and on his &s;tyle
to the fond partiality of her affection for
him, was &s;urpri&s;ed to find in the&s;e letters
the mo&s;t manly, clear, and &s;en&s;ible &s;tile
&s;he had almo&s;t ever met with. The ge|nerous
emulation which appeared between
the&s;e lovers, their di&s;intere&s;ted tenderne&s;s,
and the &s;teadine&s;s of their mutual attach|ment,
<PB N="209" REF="211">
rai&s;ed in Cele&s;tina admiration and
even re&s;pect, and every hour encrea&s;ed her
inclination to contribute to their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But the&s;e intentions &s;he had no way
of executing but by means of Willoughby,
who was, as &s;he knew from long experi|ence,
ever ready to befriend the unfortu|nate;
and on &s;uch an occa&s;ion &s;he thought,
that as &s;oon as he was married &s;he might,
without any impropriety, addre&s;s her&s;elf
to him; and as the farm which old Win|nington,
the grandfather of Je&s;&s;y, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
adjoined to his e&s;tate at Alve&s;tone, Ce|le&s;tina
imagined he could hardly fail of
having &s;ome influence, which &s;he knew
he would be ready to exert for her unfor|tunate
friend.</P>
<P>In meditating how to admini&s;ter to the
afflictions of others, her own &s;orrows were
at lea&s;t mitigated: but the calm &s;he out|wardly
a&s;&s;umed was the mere effort of re|&s;olution,
while her anxiety to hear of Wil|loughby
and of his &s;i&s;ter encrea&s;ed every
hour; and as the delay grew more unac|countable,
<PB N="210" REF="212">
it became almo&s;t in&s;upportably
painful.</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of March:
the weather was uncommonly cold and
dreary; and a deep &s;now, which had
fallen &s;ome days before, had confined Ce|le&s;tina
and her companion almo&s;t entirely
to the hou&s;e. It was very unu&s;ual to &s;ee
any per&s;on pa&s;s by the hou&s;e, near which
there was no public road, and the incle|mency
of the &s;ea&s;on rendered it &s;till le&s;s
frequent: Je&s;&s;y, therefore, who went to
the window by accident to fetch &s;ome
work that lay there, mentioned to Cele&s;tina,
as a matter of &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, that two foot
pa&s;&s;engers, who had the appearance of gen|tlemen,
were cro&s;&s;ing the common towards
the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who was at that moment me|ditating,
with her eyes fixed on the fire,
on the long, long &s;pace of time that had
elap&s;ed &s;ince &s;he had heard of Willough|by,
and on all the events that might have
taken place in that period, gave very little
<PB N="211" REF="213">
attention to this intelligence, and on Je&s;&s;y's
repeating it, an&s;wered that probably it was
&s;ome per&s;ons who had lo&s;t their way in
the &s;now and were coming to the hou&s;e
for directions to regain the road.</P>
<P>To Je&s;&s;y, however, the idea of Cathcart
was ever pre&s;ent: one of the &s;trangers was
not unlike him in figure as &s;he fancied,
though both were wrapped in great coats;
and the po&s;&s;ibility of his having come in
&s;earch of her, had no &s;ooner &s;truck her,
than with eager eyes and a beating heart
&s;he watched every &s;tep they took: at
length they entered the little gate that di|vided
the garden of the hou&s;e from the
common; Je&s;&s;y was then convinced that
neither of them were Cathcart; but her
curio&s;ity was &s;trongly excited, and li&s;ten|ing
to the que&s;tions they put to the &s;ervant
who went to the door, &s;he di&s;tinctly heard
one of them enquire for Mi&s;s de Mornay.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina was now in her turn alarmed;
and trembling, though &s;he knew not why,
&s;he de&s;ired Je&s;&s;y to go down and a&s;k who
<PB N="212" REF="214">
it was, but before &s;he could be obeyed the
door opened, and &s;he &s;aw, with emotions
to which language cannot do ju&s;tice&mdash;Willoughby
him&s;elf!</P>
<P>The fir&s;t idea that &s;truck her was, that
he was come to announce his marriage;
and the air of triumph and &s;atisfaction his
countenance wore, &s;eemed to tell her he
was the happy hu&s;band of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man.
Long as &s;he had been accu&s;tomed
to dwell on this idea, &s;he &s;hrunk with ter|ror
from it's &s;uppo&s;ed reality, and pale and
trembling drew back, as he eagerly ad|vanced
towards her:&mdash;"My heavenly
girl! my own Cele&s;tina!" cried he as he
took her hand. This addre&s;s, from the
married Willoughby, &s;eemed an in&s;ult: &s;he
withdrew her hand with an air of re&s;ent|ment,
would have &s;poken but could not,
and unable to &s;upport her&s;elf &s;at down.</P>
<P>Willoughby, who&s;e own anxious emo|tions
had too much prevented his con&s;i|dering
how &s;he might be affected by his
abrupt appearance, now &s;aw that he had
<PB N="213" REF="215">
been too precipitate. He placed him&s;elf
by her, and again taking the hand &s;he had
withdrawn, he enquired, with more ten|derne&s;s
and le&s;s impetuo&s;ity, if &s;he was
&s;orry to &s;ee him. Again Cele&s;tina would
have &s;poken, but her native pride again
refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; and while &s;he was
vainly endeavouring to acquire re&s;olution
enough to congratulate him on his &s;up|po&s;ed
marriage, &s;he learned that he had
not only broken for ever with Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
but was come to offer him&s;elf
to her, who had from his childhood been
the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of his affections.</P>
<P>This &s;udden and unexpected happine&s;s
was too much. Her rea&s;on, which in the
&s;evere&s;t calamity had never quite de&s;erted
her, now &s;eemed unequal to tidings &s;o
overwhelming, and for a moment or
two &s;he &s;at like a &s;tatue; till Willoughby,
in that well known voice, and with that
graceful and manly tenderne&s;s which had
rendered him ever &s;o dear to her, related
all that had pa&s;&s;ed from the hour of their
<PB N="214" REF="216">
la&s;t parting, and the re&s;olution he had
adopted of &s;acrificing that wealth, which
could not be&s;tow happine&s;s, to the long
and incurable pa&s;&s;ion he had conceived
for an object &s;o de&s;erving, and without
whom no advantages of fortune or &s;itua|tion
could give his life the &s;malle&s;t value.</P>
<P>Tears of gratitude and affection now
fell from the eyes of Cele&s;tina; and as he
found the tumult of her &s;pirits &s;ub&s;ide, he
went on to relate to her, with the mo&s;t
generous delicacy, the plans he had formed
for their future life, and the means by
which he hoped to retrieve his affairs,
without &s;acrificing his happine&s;s. Ten|derly
however as he touched on the&s;e &s;ub|jects,
his violated promi&s;e to his mother
returned with all it's force to the recollec|tion
of Cele&s;tina. Willoughby, who&s;e
eyes were fixed on her's, &s;aw the painful
idea by their expre&s;&s;ion as &s;oon as it aro&s;e,
and in a voice that trembled from emotions
he could not repre&s;s, he endeavoured to
obviate the objections he feared &s;he was
<PB N="215" REF="217">
about to make, even before &s;he could ut|ter
them.</P>
<P>All his eloquence, however, could not
&s;ilence that monitor in the brea&s;t of Ce|le&s;tina,
which told her that there was
more of &s;ophi&s;try than of &s;ound rea&s;on in
his arguments; but fondly attached to
him as &s;he was, it was &s;ophi&s;try too en|chanting
for her to have courage to at|tempt
detecting it. She wi&s;hed to be con|vinced
Willoughby was right; to &s;ee him
happy had almo&s;t from her earlie&s;t recol|lection
been the &s;econd wi&s;h of her heart;
for perhaps to have the power of making
him &s;o had always, even unknown to
her&s;elf, been the fir&s;t: that happine&s;s
&s;eemed now to depend upon her; and &s;he
determined (after one of tho&s;e &s;hort &s;trug|gles,
in which, when inclination and duty
contend, the former has too often the ad|vantage,)
to &s;ti&s;le within her own bo&s;om
every painful remembrance, to think as
he thought, and in rendering happy the
&s;on of her bene&s;actre&s;s, to acquit her&s;elf
<PB N="216" REF="218">
through her future life of the debt of grati|tude
&s;he owed her.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, therefore, made no objection
to the propo&s;als Willoughby laid before
her, which were, that they &s;hould be mar|ried
privately in about ten days, and take
up their abode at Alve&s;tone in the &s;ame
&s;tile they meant always to re&s;ide in. The&s;e
preliminaries being arranged, Willoughby
be&s;ought her to permit him to introduce
Vava&s;our to her, who had been waiting be|low;
he went down him&s;elf to bring up
his friend; and Cele&s;tina, in the moment
of his ab&s;ence, endeavoured to recall her
pre&s;ence of mind, and habituate her&s;elf to
think with le&s;s agitation on the happine&s;s
of being the wife of her beloved Wil|loughby.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, from the ardour with which
his friend had &s;poken of her per&s;onal per|fections,
was prepared to find her very
lovely; and Willoughby on their fir&s;t in|terview
watched his looks, trying to di&s;|cover
if his expectations had been an|&s;wered:
<PB N="217" REF="219">
they were compleatly &s;o: the
agitation &s;he had &s;uffered had rai&s;ed the
glow of her cheeks, and given more &s;oft|ne&s;s
to her eyes, in which the tears yet trem|bled;
while the natural dignity of her
manner received in his opinion new charms
from the remains of embarra&s;&s;ment which
&s;he endeavoured to &s;hake off, and in which,
after a few moments, &s;he &s;ucceeded &s;o well,
that they all became as much at their ea&s;e
as if they had all been as long acquainted
as Willoughby and Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>Je&s;&s;y, who had left the room on Wil|loughby's
fir&s;t entrance, was now de&s;ired
by Cele&s;tina to return. During her &s;hort
ab&s;ence, while &s;he prepared a repa&s;t of
cold meat for the hungry travellers who
had walked from Alve&s;tone, Cele&s;tina re|lated
to them as much of her hi&s;tory as
intere&s;ted both of them in her favour; and
Willoughby, who found in every &s;entiment
and every action of Cele&s;tina &s;omething
to encrea&s;e his tenderne&s;s and admiration,
was charmed with the generous pity &s;he
<PB N="218" REF="220">
had &s;hewn to her humble friend, and pro|mi&s;ed
her all his influence to obtain for
her the provi&s;ion &s;he had a right to ex|pect
from her grandfather, and unite her
to her de&s;erving lover.</P>
<P>Willoughby hung with fondne&s;s ap|proaching
to adoration on every word Ce|le&s;tina
uttered, and forgot, that for this time
the delight of &s;eeing her mu&s;t be &s;hort;
Vava&s;our, gay, volatile, and enjoying
with extreme good humour the happine&s;s
of his friend, was little accu&s;tomed to think
at all; and Je&s;&s;y was in too humble a
&s;ituation to offer her opinion: on Cele&s;tina
only, therefore, the prudence of the whole
party depended; and as the &s;now was very
deep, and they had between eight and nine
miles to Alve&s;tone, &s;he at la&s;t ventured
to hint that it was time they &s;hould go.</P>
<P>To Willoughby, the nece&s;&s;ity of quitting
her had never occurred, and he now heard
of it as a &s;entence of bani&s;hment; but
Cele&s;tina repeating that &s;he &s;hould be very
unea&s;y if in &s;uch weather they delayed &s;o
<PB N="219" REF="221">
long a walk to a late hour in the evening, he
&s;aw that he &s;hould make her really uncom|fortable
by his &s;tay; and having obtained
leave to &s;ee her the next day, and every
day till they were to part no more, he at
la&s;t con&s;ented to go, that he and his com|panion
might reach Alve&s;tone before the
night fell.</P>
<P>When he relea&s;ed the hand of Cele&s;tina,
which he ki&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and times as he
bade her adieu, &s;he turned towards the
window, and her eyes followed him
acro&s;s the heath till the furze and
thorns at a di&s;tance concealed him from
her sight. The very traces of his foot&s;teps
in the &s;now were dear to her; and in that
frame of mind which renders it hardly
con&s;cious of it's own &s;en&s;ations, &s;he &s;till
gazed on <HI>them</HI> when &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h
<HI>him</HI> no longer. Je&s;&s;y, though &s;he could
ea&s;ily account for her &s;ilence, became
after &s;ome time unea&s;y, and &s;peaking to
her, rou&s;ed her from her reverie: &s;he then
&s;at down in her u&s;ual place, and attempted
<PB N="220" REF="222">
to quiet the perturbation of her mind by
re-a&s;&s;uming her u&s;ual occupations; but
the &s;udden tran&s;ition within the la&s;t three
hours, from lifele&s;s de&s;pondence to a pro&s;|pect
of the utmo&s;t felicity &s;he had ever
imagined, was too violent to &s;uffer her
&s;pirits to return to their u&s;ual calm. The
recollection of her decea&s;ed benefactre&s;s,
and of the fatal promi&s;e Willoughby had
given her, recurred in de&s;pite of her en|deavours
to e&s;cape from it: and though,
re&s;olute as he appeared to be, to reconcile
him&s;elf to its violation, there was nobody
who had power by their interference to pre|vent
the execution of the determination he
had made; though nothing was likely to
prevent the marriage on which he had re|&s;olved
upon; yet the mind of Cele&s;tina re|mained
impre&s;&s;ed with a confu&s;ed &s;en&s;a|tion
rather than any di&s;tinct pro&s;pect of
the happine&s;s &s;he had been offered; and
the tran&s;actions of the day appeared like a
dream, from which &s;he feared, by examin|ing
it's reality, to be awakened.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>NEITHER the per&s;on or the mind
of Cele&s;tina were of that &s;ort which make
the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the fir&s;t view;
and intere&s;ting as her figure and face were,
it was the grace as well as the &s;ymmetry of
the former, and the expre&s;&s;ion rather than
the beauty of the latter that made her
altogether &s;o enchanting. Willoughby
and Vava&s;our were now with her every
day; and while her lover found in every
hour of tho&s;e days more rea&s;on to congra|tulate
him&s;elf on the choice he had made,
his friend grew in&s;en&s;ibly &s;o intere&s;ted for
Cele&s;tina, that volatile and un&s;teady as he
had been till then, he found, that though,
con&s;idering her already as Willoughby's
wife, he could form neither hopes or de|&s;igns
<PB N="222" REF="224">
for him&s;elf, yet that her happine&s;s
was the fir&s;t wi&s;h of his heart; and that
without violating his warm friend&s;hip to|wards
his friend, he, for the fir&s;t time in
his life, envied a man who was going to
be married.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent happine&s;s of Willoughby
could be exceeded in his idea only by that
which he imagined he had &s;ecured to him|&s;elf
by having determined to live only for
the happine&s;s of Cele&s;tina; and in conti|nually
contemplating her perfections, he
endeavoured to ju&s;tify to him&s;elf the mea|&s;ures
he had taken, and to di&s;mi&s;s from
his mind the unplea&s;ing circum&s;tances
which might have robbed him of her for
ever. He had written, after many attempts,
to Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, declining to carry any
farther a negociation in which his inclina|tions
had never any &s;hare; and though he
&s;oftened this mortifying information as
well as he could, he was &s;en&s;ible of the
bitterne&s;s and re&s;entment it mu&s;t create,
and indeed was &s;o little &s;atisfied him&s;elf
<PB N="223" REF="225">
with his performance, that after the fifth or
&s;ixth attempt, he would &s;till have delayed
or wholly have evaded &s;ending the letter,
if Vava&s;our had not with many arguments
and much difficulty per&s;uaded him, that,
re&s;olved as he was to break with the fa|mily,
any letter he could write in explana|tion,
would be le&s;s offen&s;ive than total &s;i|lence.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina was very &s;olicitous to know
how he had acquitted him&s;elf towards his
uncle; yet, as he &s;eemed &s;edulou&s;ly to
avoid the &s;ubject, &s;he feared to give him
pain by recurring to it, and yielded per|haps
too ea&s;ily to the artifices &s;he &s;aw he
u&s;ed to draw her thoughts from it: while
he, &s;tudying every turn of her &s;peaking
face, often &s;aw, by the pen&s;ive ca&s;t it a&s;|&s;umed,
unea&s;y thoughts ari&s;e in her mind;
and on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, exerting him&s;elf to
di&s;pel them, he delighted to recall their
&s;parkling vivacity to her eyes:
<Q>E'l lampeggiar dell' angelico ri&s;o,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PETRARCH. The lightning of the angelic &s;mile.</NOTE></Q>
<PB N="224" REF="226">
which never be&s;towed greater charms on
any countenance than on that of Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>It was now decided that as &s;oon as the
&s;ettlements were fini&s;hed, which Willough|by
had directed rather according to his
love than to his fortune, and which were
likely to take up about three weeks, Ce|le&s;tina
was to become mi&s;tre&s;s of Alve&s;tone.
He had promi&s;ed her to forbear making
about that delightful place any of the al|terations
he meditated, till his income was
&s;o far retrieved as to allow him to do it
with prudence, but he had a thou&s;and rea|&s;ons
ready why Cele&s;tina &s;hould go there
every day; for to re&s;ide there entirely, till
&s;he was married, &s;he had refu&s;ed with &s;uch
firmne&s;s as left Willoughby nothing to
urge with any chance of &s;ucce&s;s. Partial
as him&s;elf to this &s;pot, where &s;he had
pa&s;&s;ed the happie&s;t hours of her life, &s;he
yet, in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, felt di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
and unea&s;y at the thoughts of vi&s;iting it;
but Willoughby pre&s;&s;ed it with &s;o much
earne&s;tne&s;s, that, as the weather was now
<PB N="225" REF="227">
fine, and &s;he had defended her&s;elf as long
as &s;he could, &s;he at length, on condition
of having Je&s;&s;y with her, agreed to go
there for a whole day, and that Wil|loughby
&s;hould fetch them both in his
phaeton. <HI>C'e&s;t le premier pas qui coute,</HI>
&s;ays a French proverb; and he longed to
have this day over, knowing that the
memorials of his mother, which Cele&s;tina
would there meet with, and which he
feared would give her &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tions,
would, after &s;he was accu&s;tomed to
&s;ee them, lo&s;e their effect on her mind,
and that &s;he would in&s;en&s;ibly learn to be|hold
them rather with agreeable than un|ea&s;y
&s;entiments.</P>
<P>He per&s;uaded him&s;elf that &s;uch a revo|lution
had been effected in his own mind,
and that notwith&s;tanding his clear recol|lection
of certain forcible words his mother
had u&s;ed in their la&s;t melancholy inter|view,
he was, in making him&s;elf happy,
doing that, which, if &s;he had yet any know|ledge
<PB N="226" REF="228">
of human events, &s;he would mo&s;t
warmly approve.</P>
<P>Intoxicated with his pa&s;&s;ion, which rea|&s;on
and ta&s;te &s;eemed &s;o entirely to ju&s;tify,
and an extorted promi&s;e only to oppo&s;e,
Willoughby no longer &s;uffered any unea&s;y
recollections to ca&s;t a &s;hade over the
bright pro&s;pect opening before him. He
now &s;aw Cele&s;tina, the woman he had
from his infancy adored, in that &s;pot where
his local affections were &s;o fondly &s;ettled.
Nothing &s;eemed likely to impede his pa&s;&s;ing
with her there a life of uninterrupted feli|city;
and till their union could take place,
his greate&s;t anxiety was to detach her
imagination from all tho&s;e objections which
might yet linger in her mind, and to con|firm
her in the per&s;ua&s;ion that to con&s;titute
through her future life the happine&s;s of the
&s;on of her benefactre&s;s, would be her be&s;t
acquittal of tho&s;e obligations &s;he owed to
her in the early part of it.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of &s;uffering her to
vi&s;it immediately the particular parts of
<PB N="227" REF="229">
the hou&s;e which he knew would mo&s;t
forcibly recall ideas which might di&s;tre&s;s
her, he de&s;ired Vava&s;our to attend on Je&s;&s;y,
and follow them into the garden, where,
when they were at a little di&s;tance, he re|lated
to Cele&s;tina the mea&s;ures he had
already taken to re&s;tore or rather to in|troduce
her amiable and injured friend to
the favour of her grandfather. Cele&s;tina
warmly approved his proceedings, and
gratefully acknowledged his kindne&s;s,
while the hope of &s;eeing Je&s;&s;y re&s;cued
from the &s;evere hard&s;hips to which &s;he mu&s;t
otherwi&s;e be expo&s;ed, and rewarding the
di&s;intere&s;ted attachment of her de&s;erving
lover, was mo&s;t grateful to her generous
heart. Willoughby him&s;elf never &s;eemed
&s;o perfect as when thus employing his time
and his power in the &s;ervice of the un|happy.
The fine &s;cenery around her ne|ver
appeared to &s;uch advantage as now,
when &s;he leaned on one arm while with
the other he pointed out to her its various
beauties; and at this moment the very
<PB N="228" REF="230">
&s;ea&s;on &s;eemed to add &s;omething to her
felicity. Within a few days the whole
face of nature was changed: the &s;now,
which had covered every object with
cold uniformity, had now given place
to the bright verdure of infant &s;pring;
the earlie&s;t trees and tho&s;e in the mo&s;t
&s;heltered &s;ituations had put forth their ten|der
buds; the cop&s;es were &s;trewn with
primro&s;es and March violets, and the
garden glowing with the fir&s;t flowers of
the year; while in&s;tead of the u&s;ually rude
winds of the &s;ea&s;on, tho&s;e gales only blew
which
<Q><L>Call forth the long expecting flowers</L>
<L>And wake the purple year!</L></Q>
Myriads of birds, who found food and
&s;helter amid the &s;hrubberies and wood|walks,
&s;eemed to hail with &s;ongs their
future lovely protectre&s;s,
<Q>Hopp'd in her walks and gambol'd in her eyes:</Q>
and while every thing was thus gay and
<PB N="229" REF="231">
cheerful without, the hou&s;e, when &s;he en|tered
it, &s;hewed her only contented faces:
the old &s;ervants, it's ancient and faithful
inhabitants, had known and loved her from
her earlie&s;t childhood, and rejoiced in the
hope of ending their days in her &s;ervice;
the tenants, who loved their young land|lord,
were glad to find, that in&s;tead of
carrying his rents to London he was
coming to &s;ettle among them; and the
poor, who had now for &s;ome time &s;everely
mi&s;&s;ed the bounty which had marked Mrs.
Willoughby's annual re&s;idence among
them, invoked ble&s;&s;ings on her &s;on, from
whom they were a&s;&s;ured of more con&s;tant
con&s;ideration, from his own noble nature
as well as from the influence of Cele&s;tina,
who, as they well remembered, was for|merly
the &s;ucce&s;sful mediatrix between
them and their decea&s;ed mi&s;tre&s;s, when
her own daughter had frequently heard
their petitions with indifference, or avoided
them with di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="232">
In a few days after this fir&s;t vi&s;it to
Alve&s;tone, a fortunate circum&s;tance oc|curred
to facilitate the good offices Wil|loughby
had undertaken in favour of
Je&s;&s;y Woodburn. The old female rela|tion
who had acquired unbounded influ|ence
over her grandfather died &s;uddenly;
and the old man, thus re&s;tored to the little
power of reflection his very advanced age
left him, and alarmed by the death of a
per&s;on younger than him&s;elf, no longer re|fu&s;ed
to li&s;ten to the remon&s;trances of a
clergyman in the neighbourhood, who had
by Willoughby been engaged to &s;peak to
him in favour of his daughter's child. He
con&s;ented to &s;ee her, provided no attempt
was made to introduce her father to him,
towards whom neither time, age, or &s;ick|ne&s;s,
had blunted the a&s;perity of his hatred;
but though the&s;e odious pa&s;&s;ions retained,
from habitual indulgence, all their inve|terate
malignity, the &s;ofter feelings of na|tural
affection were dead in him; and ra|ther
yielding to importunity than prompted
<PB N="231" REF="233">
by inclination, he con&s;ented to receive
his granddaughter to officiate about him as
a &s;ervant, and &s;tipulated that during his
life &s;he &s;hould be no expence to him;
thus gra&s;ping to the la&s;t moment of his
exi&s;tence, that which he had never en|joyed,
and could no longer want. As he
had nobody he valued more, he con|&s;ented
however, after many per&s;ua&s;ions, to
make a will, by which he gave her every
thing, on the expre&s;s condition, to u&s;e his
own phra&s;e, that her father "might never
be the better for it."</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary, though this important
point was carried, that Je&s;&s;y &s;hould, by
re&s;iding with him, preclude the po&s;&s;ibility
of being again &s;uperceded by &s;ome of
tho&s;e mercenary beings who are in all
ranks of life ready to &s;urround the couch
of the dying mi&s;er: a nece&s;&s;ity Cele&s;tina
admitted with reluctance, and Je&s;&s;y with
tears and regret; but they were both
con&s;oled by the reflection that a very
&s;hort time mu&s;t in &s;ome degree re-unite
<PB N="232" REF="234">
them by the removal of Cele&s;tina to Alve&s;|tone,
which was within a walk of the farm
at which her friend was now to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>Willoughby, having thus far &s;ucceeded
for the intere&s;ting proteg&eacute;e of Cele&s;tina,
determined to complete his generous work
by attending to the &s;ituation of Cathcart.
He knew nothing could more highly
oblige <HI>her,</HI> to contribute to who&s;e &s;lighte&s;t
&s;atisfaction was the &s;upreme plea&s;ure of
his life; and his own good heart prompted
him to lo&s;e no time in relieving the un|merited
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a de&s;erving young
man: he wrote, therefore, (without com|municating
what he had done) to Cath|cart,
enclo&s;ed him a bank note for his
expences; and informing him of all that
pa&s;&s;ed in regard to Je&s;&s;y, de&s;ired that he
would relinqui&s;h his place with the attor|ney,
and come down to Alve&s;tone, where
Willoughby meant that the &s;ame day which
gave him Cele&s;tina &s;hould unite Cathcart
to her humble friend.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="235">
The joy this unexpected turn of fortune
gave to Cathcart can better be imagined
than de&s;cribed. That &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;oul,
which long de&s;pondence and anxiety had
produced, vani&s;hed at once: his imme|diate
care was to &s;ecure his &s;i&s;ter's and
her children's &s;upport during his ab&s;ence;
and re&s;erving to him&s;elf no more of Wil|loughby's
generous pre&s;ent than &s;ufficed
for the expences of his journey, he took a
tender leave of Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, a&s;&s;uring
her that the fir&s;t u&s;e he would make of his
good fortune &s;hould be to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; he
then &s;et out on a hired hor&s;e for Alve&s;tone,
where he arrived ten days before that which
was fixed upon for his patron's happine&s;s
and his own.</P>
<P>If Willoughby had been greatly inte|re&s;ted
for him before he &s;aw him, he was
much more &s;o now that he found him very
intelligent and well informed, with abilities
that might have made his way to any &s;i|tuation
of life, and a heart that would
have done honour to the mo&s;t exalted:
<PB N="234" REF="236">
his knowledge, which was very exten&s;ive,
was without pedantry, and his gratitude
without &s;ervility. The meeting between
him and Je&s;&s;y, at which Willoughby con|trived
that Cele&s;tina &s;hould be pre&s;ent,
was very affecting; and after the fir&s;t
tran&s;ports of happine&s;s &s;o unexpected had
a little &s;ub&s;ided, Willoughby explained
to them his views for the future. "You,
my dear Je&s;&s;y," &s;aid he, "mu&s;t not think
of leaving your grandfather, who mu&s;t
know nothing of your marriage while he
lives, which can, according to the cour&s;e
of nature, be only a very little time; and
as you may &s;ee each other every day, this
partial &s;eparation may for that little time
be ea&s;ily borne. As for you, Cathcart,
you will &s;tay with me: I have, in con&s;e|quence
of my new plan of life, many re|gulations
to make, and many accounts to
&s;ettle, in which you can be of great u&s;e
to me. Poor Beechcroft, my old &s;teward,
is in his eightieth year, and the pal&s;y has
lately made &s;uch ravages in his intel|lects,
<PB N="235" REF="237">
that he is unequal to the common
bu&s;ine&s;s of his office; while he lives how|ever,
and thinks him&s;elf capable of exe|cuting
his tru&s;t, I am very unwilling to
mortify him by taking the affairs out of
his hands: at his death I &s;hall not replace
him, but become my own &s;teward; and
you, my good friend, can be of the mo&s;t
effectual &s;ervice to me in preparing every
thing for this arrangement: while your
neighbourhood to the e&s;tate of which you
will probably &s;oon become ma&s;ter, will
give you an opportunity of in&s;pecting it,
and &s;ettling tho&s;e plans for the future
which will I hope and believe make you
a very fortunate man."</P>
<P>While the con&s;iderate kindne&s;s of Wil|loughby
endeared him every hour to Ce|le&s;tina,
and while the hearts of Cathcart
and Je&s;&s;y overflowed with gratitude, it
would have been hardly po&s;&s;ible for a hap|pier
party to have been any where found
than that which now occa&s;ionally inha|bited
Alve&s;tone, if the painful recollection
<PB N="236" REF="238">
of Willoughby's violated promi&s;e could
have been entirely expelled from the con|&s;cious
recollection of Cele&s;tina, and if
Vava&s;our had not &s;ometimes felt towards
Cele&s;tina &s;omething bordering on &s;erious
love, which was a &s;entiment &s;o new to
him, who had never thought with re&s;pect|ful
affection of any woman before, and
had pa&s;&s;ed too much of his time in &s;cenes
of fa&s;hionable debauchery, that he hardly
knew him&s;elf what it meant. He formed
however no de&s;igns, for his temper was
generous, candid, and artle&s;s; &s;o artle&s;s
indeed that he took no pains to conceal
what he felt almo&s;t without under&s;tanding
his feelings; and frequently fixed his
eyes on Cele&s;tina with &s;o impa&s;&s;ioned a
look, or &s;poke to her, or of her, with &s;uch
unre&s;erved marks of fondne&s;s and admira|tion,
that Je&s;&s;y and Cathcart both &s;aw it
with &s;ome alarm; but Willoughby, too
liberal for jealou&s;y, and knowing his friend
more inclined to general libertini&s;m among
the loo&s;er part of the &s;ex than capable of
<PB N="237" REF="239">
a particular attachment to any woman of
character; &s;ure of Cele&s;tina's affection,
and imputing all Vava&s;our's attentions to
his admiration of beauty wherever found,
either noticed not his manner, or held them
to be wholly without con&s;equence; while
Cele&s;tina, perfectly uncon&s;cious of the
power of her own charms, treated him
with that affectionate familiarity which his
own open and lively manners encouraged,
and which his friend&s;hip for Willoughby,
and the obligations they both owed to him,
ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>Only three days were now to intervene
before that fixed for the double wedding,
which was to be celebrated in the pari&s;h
church at Alve&s;tone, in the pre&s;ence only
of two tru&s;ty &s;ervants, and Vava&s;our, who
was to act as father to both the brides.</P>
<P>Very different pro&s;pects of life from
tho&s;e which now were before Willoughby
and Cele&s;tina, had opened to Mr. and Mrs.
Molyneux, who, on their arrival in Ire|land,
had found Sir O&s;wald Molyneux
<PB N="238" REF="240">
ju&s;t alive: he lingered unexpectedly a few
weeks after their arrival, and then died,
leaving to his &s;on an immen&s;e fortune, of
which Sir Philip ha&s;tened to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
and to di&s;play, as &s;oon as decency
permitted, his wealth and his intere&s;t;
while Matilda, now Lady Molyneux, lo&s;t
no opportunity of availing her&s;elf of the
eclat which almo&s;t boundle&s;s fortune gave
to novelty. Nobody was &s;o much fol|lowed
and admired; no ta&s;te was &s;o uni|ver&s;ally
adopted, no parties &s;o &s;plendidly
attended, as her's; and having thus at|tained
the &s;ummit of what &s;he fancied hap|pine&s;s,
&s;he was in no ha&s;te to return to
England till &s;he had exhau&s;ted the felicity
Ireland offered her, and cheerfully ac|quie&s;ced
in her hu&s;band's propo&s;al of
&s;taying one &s;ummer at their magnificent
&s;eat about twenty miles from Dublin. In
the mean time &s;he had heard from her bro|ther,
who&s;e re&s;entment towards her hu&s;|band
did not extend to her, of his having
broke with the Ca&s;tlenorths, and his inten|tions
<PB N="239" REF="241">
in regard to Cele&s;tina. She di&s;liked
both Lady Ca&s;tlenorth and her daughter,
and therefore was plea&s;ed with their morti|fication
and di&s;appointment: &s;he had now
no pecuniary claims on her brother, and
heard therefore with indifference his re&s;o|lution
to marry a woman without fortune;
and as to Cele&s;tina, though &s;he was inca|pable
of any affection for her, yet &s;he
thought &s;he would make a good quiet wife
for her brother, and be well adapted to that
in&s;ipid dome&s;tic life, his turn for which
&s;he had always pitied and de&s;pi&s;ed. As
Willoughby's ju&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t Sir
Philip had never given her any concern,
&s;he gave her&s;elf no trouble to remove it;
and Sir Philip him&s;elf, above all attention
for the feelings of others, and too much a
man of the very fir&s;t fa&s;hion to under&s;tand
the claims of relation&s;hip, or to feel tho&s;e
of friend&s;hip, was as unconcerned as if no
&s;uch re&s;entment had ever been de&s;erved;
and while they both enjoyed their newly
acquired con&s;equence in Ireland, Wil|loughby
<PB N="240" REF="242">
was &s;uffered to proceed his own
way at Alve&s;tone without remon&s;trance and
almo&s;t without notice.</P>
<P>But neither the neglect of his &s;i&s;ter, or
the &s;ullen re&s;entment of his uncle and Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth, from whom he heard nothing,
now gave Willoughby any concern: his
happine&s;s it was out of their power to
di&s;turb or prevent, &s;ince one day only in|tervened
before he was to be the hu&s;band
of Cele&s;tina.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>VAVASOUR, born to a &s;plendid for|tune,
and left by the early death of his
parents to the care of guardians, who,
while they took &s;ufficient care of his pro|perty,
had very little influence over his
mind and his morals, had never yet formed
a wi&s;h which it was not immediately in his
power to gratify: the growing inclination,
therefore, that he found towards Cele&s;tina, was
painful and unea&s;y to him, for he had too
much honour, and too true a regard for
Willoughby, to &s;uffer a thought injurious
to him to dwell on his mind; and had he
been capable of entertaining wi&s;hes or
forming &s;chemes again&s;t his happine&s;s, he
knew that Cele&s;tina's attachment to him
was not to be &s;haken, and that he &s;hould
<PB N="242" REF="244">
excite her contempt and abhorrence in|&s;tead
of continuing to enjoy that confidence
and regard with which &s;he now favoured
him.</P>
<P>But the more hopele&s;s his partiality for
her was, the more re&s;tle&s;s he of cour&s;e be|came
in it's encrea&s;e: for &s;everal days he
endeavoured to conquer or at lea&s;t to con|ceal
it by redoubling his gaiety: he
romped, laughed, and rattled, till his
violent &s;pirits became even di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to
Cele&s;tina: all however would not do; and
as he had no notion of enduring any kind
of unea&s;ine&s;s while there was a chance of
relieving him&s;elf, he at length re&s;olved to
quit Willoughby, and not to return to him
till after he was actually married; and this
re&s;olution he prepared to execute the fol|lowing
morning, which was the preceding
one to that which was fixed for the mar|riage.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall leave you this morning,
George," &s;aid he to Willoughby, as they
were at breakfa&s;t together.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="245">
"Leave me!" cried Willoughby in
much &s;urpri&s;e: "for what rea&s;on?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e I hate all formal ceremonies,
and have be&s;ides bu&s;ine&s;s el&s;ewhere."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous! &s;urely you are not in
earne&s;t?"</P>
<P>"Perfectly &s;o, believe me: never more
in earne&s;t in my life. I'll come back to
you in a week or ten days, but I po&s;itively
go this very day."</P>
<P>"Thou art a &s;trange fellow, and there
is never any telling where to have thee.
Did you not promi&s;e to be father to the
brides? What will Cele&s;tina &s;ay?"</P>
<P>"Why probably as you do&mdash;that I am
a &s;trange fellow."</P>
<P>"You make me unea&s;y, Harry," &s;aid
Willoughby very gravely. "Whim&s;ical
and un&s;ettled as you are, it mu&s;t be &s;urely
&s;omething more than mere whim which
urges you to leave me at &s;uch a time."</P>
<P>"Not at all," an&s;wered he gaily: "it
is the time in the world you can be&s;t &s;pare
me; and upon my &s;oul I have bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="244" REF="246">
to do which I have fooli&s;hly neglected,
and which I mu&s;t either go after now or a
fortnight hence, when I intend to be with
you; and &s;o, my dear George, we'll talk
no more about it: my &s;ervants are getting
ready, and will be at the door in a minute:
oh they are driving round. Well, George,
God ble&s;s you, my dear fellow. Give my
love to the girls, and tell Cele&s;tina to &s;ave
me a great piece of bride cake."</P>
<P>Willoughby would again have remon|&s;trated,
but Vava&s;our, in his wild way,
ran on rallying him about his marriage,
and refu&s;ing to li&s;ten to him, till the cur|ricle
was ready; into which he &s;tepped,
after again promi&s;ing to return in a fort|night,
and immediately drove away.</P>
<P>Willoughby, though long accu&s;tomed
to the&s;e &s;tarts of caprice from his thought|le&s;s
friend, was equally &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;|concerted
at a re&s;clution for which he could
not account: he was far from the remote&s;t
idea of the real cau&s;e; and, occupied as
his thoughts were by Cele&s;tina, he inve&s;ti|gated
<PB N="245" REF="247">
not &s;o deeply the motives of his
friend's actions as at another time he might
have done.</P>
<P>On the preceding day, moved by his
tender reproaches that &s;he had no confi|dence
in his honour, and affected needle&s;s
precaution, Cele&s;tina had acceded to his
wi&s;hes that &s;he would allow him, as the day
was fixed for Thur&s;day, to fetch her to
Alve&s;tone in the morning of Wedne&s;day,
where Je&s;&s;y was to meet her, and that &s;he
would then take her la&s;t leave of her hum|ble
abode on Thorpe Common.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, therefore, as Vava&s;our was
gone, he di&s;patched Cathcart for Je&s;&s;y,
and ha&s;tened him&s;elf to Cele&s;tina, who was
ready for him. As they journeyed to|wards
the hou&s;e that was henceforth to be
their home, Willoughby, with more than
u&s;ual tenderne&s;s in his voice and manner,
entered into a more minute detail than he
had ever yet done of the plans he had
formed for their future life: with the &s;an|guine
hand of youthful hope, he drew a
<PB N="246" REF="248">
picture of uninterrupted felicity, which
Cele&s;tina, involuntarily &s;ighing, thought
too perfect to be realized; and with timid
apprehen&s;ion, for which &s;he could not ac|count
and was unwilling to betray, &s;he
internally a&s;ked her&s;elf wherefore &s;he could
expect to de&s;erve or enjoy ble&s;&s;ings &s;o
much &s;uperior to the common lot of hu|manity.</P>
<P>All, however, that might have been to
another an alloy to happine&s;s, was none
to her, &s;o far as it related only to her&s;elf.
In marrying her, Willoughby had re&s;igned
all pro&s;pect of ever re&s;toring his family to
the &s;plendid fortune and high con&s;equence
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his ance&s;tors, nor could he
even retrieve the e&s;tate he had left, or
keep up the place he was &s;o fond of, but
by relinqui&s;hing all &s;uperfluous expences,
and confining him&s;elf to that mode of life,
which was &s;ome years &s;ince adopted, but
would now be thought below the preten|&s;ions
of a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only of a thou&s;and
a year: in fact Willoughby found, on a
<PB N="247" REF="249">
clo&s;e in&s;pection of his affairs, that by living
within that income, he might in about ten
years clear, without di&s;membering his
e&s;tate. "It is enough for happine&s;s, my
Cele&s;tina," he would &s;ay; "it is enough
to afford us all the decencies, and all the
comforts of life, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who
may not have either. Oh how little rea|&s;on
we &s;hall have to envy tho&s;e who have
more." Cele&s;tina a&s;&s;ented with her whole
heart; and if ever an unea&s;y reflection
aro&s;e there for a moment, repre&s;enting that
for her he re&s;igned the &s;plendour and
luxury in which he might have lived, &s;he
recollected her opinion of the greater part
of tho&s;e who moved amid a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
tho&s;e luxuries, and a&s;ked her&s;elf whether
there was one among them who was &s;o
much re&s;pected by others, or &s;o well con|tent
with him&s;elf, as Willoughby would
probably be, living as he propo&s;ed. She
remembered how often, when &s;he was ac|cu&s;tomed
to &s;ee nearly many of tho&s;e, who,
by adventitious advantages, dazzle at a
<PB N="248" REF="250">
di&s;tance, &s;he had been compelled to a&s;&s;ent
to the truth of that &s;evere expre&s;&s;ion of
the satiri&s;t's, which &s;ays, that it may be
&s;een&mdash;
<Q><L>Of how &s;mall e&s;timation is exorbitant wealth</L>
<L>In the &s;ight of God,</L>
<L>By his be&s;towing it on the mo&s;t unworthy</L>
<L>Of all mortals.</L></Q></P>
<P>The departure of Vava&s;our, of which
Willoughby had, with &s;ome marks of re|gret
and &s;urpri&s;e, on his fir&s;t meeting Ce|le&s;tina
informed her, had given her con|cern,
as it &s;eemed to have been a di&s;ap|pointment
to him; but for her&s;elf, &s;he
felt rather relieved by the ab&s;ence of a
too lively gue&s;t. There was at times an
unguarded vivacity about him, of which
&s;he was not always able to check the ex|ce&s;s;
and though &s;he had never any idea
of his partiality to her, nor thought him
capable of a &s;erious attachment to any
woman, there had of late been a warmth
and earne&s;tne&s;s in his manner which &s;he was
<PB N="249" REF="251">
afraid of being called prudi&s;h if &s;he at|tempted
to repre&s;s, and yet &s;he could not
but feel that it was improper to allow
it in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and would
be more &s;o when &s;he became the wife of
Willoughby. On their arrival at Alve&s;|tone,
the lawyer was ready with the &s;ettle|ments:
they were immediately executed in
the pre&s;ence of Cathcart and Je&s;&s;y; and
when that unplea&s;ant ceremony was over,
a walk filled up the time till dinner.
Nothing was ever &s;o gay and happy as
Willoughby: Cele&s;tina was now mi&s;tre&s;s
of his hou&s;e: his happine&s;s was &s;ecured al|mo&s;t
beyond the reach of fate: and &s;ince
only a few hours were to intervene before
their marriage, he tenderly chid Cele&s;tina
for her pen&s;ive gravity, and endeavoured
to engage her thoughts by nece&s;&s;ary ar|rangements
that he propo&s;ed in the hou&s;e,
and by enlarging on tho&s;e topics which &s;he
had li&s;tened to with &s;o much complacency
in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="252">
After dinner another walk was propo&s;ed;
but ju&s;t as they were ri&s;ing from table, a
&s;ervant entered with a letter for Willough|by,
which he &s;aid had been brought ex|pre&s;s
from Exeter.</P>
<P>He broke the &s;eal, which, like the hand
of the direction, was unknown to him;
he ran over the contents ha&s;tily, changing
countenance as he read; and then enquir|ing
if the me&s;&s;enger waited, ha&s;tily left
the room.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who watched his looks, was
alarmed both by them, and his manner of
leaving the room. A moment's reflection
&s;ubdued her apprehen&s;ions; but they were
pre&s;ently renewed and heightened by his
&s;ending to &s;peak with Cathcart; who, after
being with him almo&s;t a quarter of an
hour, returned by his directions to inform
her, that he was gone on hor&s;eback to
Exeter to meet &s;ome people who had &s;ent
to him about bu&s;ine&s;s which would admit
of no delay: he begged Cathcart to tell
her that it would be &s;oon di&s;patched, and
<PB N="251" REF="253">
that he &s;hould certainly return in a few
hours.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina knew, from his own account,
every circum&s;tance of his fortune; &s;he
knew that except the mortgages on his
e&s;tate, the intere&s;t of which had been
punctually paid, he had no pecuniary
claims to an&s;wer but his debt to Vava&s;our:
&s;he was equally certain that he had no di&s;|pute
with any body, and that therefore it
could not be an affair of honour, and &s;he
thought it certain that if Lady Molyneux
or any of his relations had been in the
neighbourhood, he would have made no
my&s;tery of their arrival: his abrupt de|parture,
therefore, without &s;eeing her, &s;ur|pri&s;ed
and troubled her; and neither her
own rea&s;on, which urged how unlikely
it was that any di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould
detain him, or the arguments of Cathcart
and Je&s;&s;y, could quiet or mitigate the
anxiety which every moment of his ab&s;ence
encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="254">
Four, five, &s;ix hours, had now been
pa&s;&s;ed by Cele&s;tina, while it was light, in
traver&s;ing the avenue and the road that led
towards Exeter; and after it became dark,
in li&s;tening at the door to every noi&s;e.
It was ten o'clock: a &s;till, &s;tar-light night:
a low wind conveyed now the di&s;tant mur|mur
of the water-fall in the park, now
the voices of men from the village, where
every thing &s;oon &s;unk into repo&s;e. Nei|ther
Cathcart nor Je&s;&s;y could longer di&s;|gui&s;e
their fears, though neither knew
what to dread; but while they affected to
believe Cele&s;tina's apprehen&s;ions in great
mea&s;ure groundle&s;s, their anxious returns
to the door to li&s;ten, their re&s;tle&s;s inquie|tude,
and various conjectures, convinced
her too evidently that they participated the
fears they pretended to condemn.</P>
<P>At length about eleven o'clock, a hor&s;e,
or as they were willing to believe, hor&s;es,
were heard to come fa&s;t along the road:
the park gate opened and &s;hut with vio|lence.
It was Willoughby they all fondly
<PB N="253" REF="255">
hoped: all ran out eagerly, impatient
to meet him: as the hor&s;eman ap|proached,
however, they di&s;tingui&s;hed
him to be not Willoughby, but the &s;ervant
who had attended him.</P>
<P>"Where is your Ma&s;ter, Hugh?" &s;aid
Cele&s;tina; "is he coming? is he well?"</P>
<P>The man took a letter from his pocket,
and an&s;wered in a dejected tone&mdash;"No,
Madam, not coming: he &s;ent me with
this letter to Mr. Cathcart."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina followed trembling, while
Cathcart ran into the hall, and by the
light which hung there, read the&s;e words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Cathcart,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>come to me imme|diately.
I &s;hall not return to-night. I
know not if&mdash;But a&s;&s;ure Cele&s;tina of
my &s;afety. Lo&s;e not a moment in
coming to</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>your's ever,
G. W.</SIGNED> <DATELINE><HI>Swan, Exeter,</HI>
<DATE>Wedne&s;day night.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="254" REF="256">
The painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e Cele&s;tina had be|fore
endured, was happine&s;s and ea&s;e in
compari&s;on of the vague but terrible ap|prehen&s;ions
that now &s;eized her. What
could detain him again&s;t his wi&s;hes? what
meant the unfini&s;hed &s;entence&mdash;"I know
not if&mdash;?" what could he want with
Cathcart? and why not di&s;clo&s;e the cau&s;e
of his &s;tay, and his bu&s;ine&s;s with Cath|cart,
if it was only an affair of little con|&s;equence,
&s;ince he could not but know
how much his &s;udden departure mu&s;t
alarm her. The note too &s;eemed to have
been written with a trembling hand; the
lines were crooked, and the letters hardly
formed, and the paper blotted: all de|noted
hurry and confu&s;ion, very unlike
Willoughby's manner in matters of mere
bu&s;ine&s;s; and the indications of &s;ome
impending evil, alarming enough in them|&s;elves,
were exaggerated by the terrors
which had now taken entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the mind of Cele&s;tina. Unable to re&s;train
her emotions, &s;he ran, hardly knowing
<PB N="255" REF="257">
whither &s;he went, to the &s;table, where the
&s;ervant who had brought the note was
getting ready the hor&s;e on which Cath|cart
was to go. She eagerly que&s;tioned
the man who was with his ma&s;ter? He
an&s;wered that he did not know: that he
&s;aw nobody with him, but he had heard at
the inn that two ladies had come thither
that morning, who had &s;ent the me&s;&s;enger
to Alve&s;tone; that he believed they had
been with his ma&s;ter, but he did not
know, and when his ma&s;ter &s;poke to him,
and gave him the letter for Mr. Cathcart,
he was alone, and &s;eemed very unea&s;y,
&s;aying however little more to him than to
de&s;ire he would make what ha&s;te he could.</P>
<P>This account &s;erved only to encrea&s;e
the terrible ob&s;curity which tormented
Cele&s;tina. A thou&s;and other que&s;tions oc|curred.
Were the&s;e ladies yet at the inn?
Did they travel in their own chai&s;e? Had
they &s;ervants with them? Hugh could
not an&s;wer the fir&s;t que&s;tion; but the other
two being &s;uch as lay more within the
<PB N="256" REF="258">
reach of his ob&s;ervation, he an&s;wered that
there were certainly neither &s;ervants nor
hor&s;es at the inn belonging to any &s;tranger
when he came away.</P>
<P>Cathcart was by this time ready; and
&s;eeing the extreme inquietude of Cele&s;tina,
he a&s;&s;umed the appearance of tranquillity
he was far from feeling, &s;aid that it was
probably &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s relative to Mr.
Willoughby's e&s;tates, which had been
overlooked and neglected; that at all
events he would be back in a few hours,
when it was almo&s;t certain that if Mr.
Willoughby did not return him&s;elf, he
&s;hould be commi&s;&s;ioned fully to acquaint
her of the rea&s;ons of his detention, and
convince her that her fears for his &s;afety
were groundle&s;s: in the mean time he
be&s;ought her to endeavour to quiet her
&s;pirits and to take &s;ome repo&s;e. Cathcart
then departed; and Cele&s;tina, leaning on
the arm of Je&s;&s;y, returned to the hou&s;e;
but to follow the advice he had given her,
was not in her power; the little &s;he
<PB N="257" REF="259">
had gathered from the &s;ervant &s;erved to
awaken new alarms, not le&s;s painful, though
very different from tho&s;e which had at fir&s;t
a&s;&s;ailed her: then &s;he had a confu&s;ed idea
that the abrupt departure of Vava&s;our had
been occa&s;ioned by &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding
between them, which had produced a
challenge; it was unlikely, but it was not
impo&s;&s;ible: now &s;he gave up that con|jecture
for another, and &s;uppo&s;ed that Wil|loughby
might have formed &s;ome con|nection
or engagement with &s;ome woman,
who, hearing of his intended marriage,
had thus prevented it by urging her prior
claim to his hand: this &s;uppo&s;ition was,
however, more improbable than the other,
from his known integrity and unblemi&s;hed
honour, from his long and tender attach|ment
to her, and from the whole tenor of
his morals and his conduct; but however
unlikely, it was not quite impo&s;&s;ible; and
the anxious and alarmed &s;pirit of Cele&s;tina
ran over the remote&s;t po&s;&s;ibilities, but
found in all only exchange of angui&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="260">
As Cathcart had promi&s;ed to return in a
few hours, Cele&s;tina, certain of not being
able to &s;leep, would not go to bed; and
Je&s;&s;y, who &s;hared all her &s;olicitude, &s;at
up with her. As the time approached
that Cathcart had named for the probable
period of his return, they were again both
at the window, and again eagerly li&s;tening
to every noi&s;e. The &s;un aro&s;e, but di&s;co|vered
not the objects of their &s;olicitude;
and Cele&s;tina, now unable to re&s;t within
the hou&s;e, be&s;ought Je&s;&s;y to go down with
her to the end of the long avenue of elms
and into the road, as if the attempt to
meet tho&s;e they expected rendered the
&s;u&s;pen&s;e le&s;s di&s;tracting.</P>
<P>Weary of conjecture, and fatigued both
in mind and body, they moved &s;lowly and
melancholy along: neither of them &s;poke,
for neither had any comfort to offer the
other. Of the labourers, who were come
by this time to their work, they enquired
if they had heard of their ma&s;ter, or &s;een
Mr. Cathcart on the road. But no intelli|gence
<PB N="259" REF="261">
could be gained of either. The
pea&s;ants, however, alarmed by the que&s;|tions
and by the looks of tho&s;e who a&s;ked
them, all eagerly offered to go any where,
to do any thing their ma&s;ter's &s;ervice might
require, and begged Cele&s;tina to employ
them: but though &s;he had &s;everal times,
during the long and anxious night, thought
of &s;ending a me&s;&s;enger with a letter to
Willoughby, or even of going her&s;elf,
&s;he now remembered that all the intelli|gence
&s;he could gain from the fir&s;t expe|dient,
&s;he would probably receive from
Cathcart before any me&s;&s;enger could get
to Exeter; and for the &s;econd, that it
might be di&s;plea&s;ing to Willoughby, were
&s;he to appear thus prying into his actions
and mi&s;tru&s;tful of his honour.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, remained but to
bear, with what firmne&s;s &s;he could, &s;u&s;|pen&s;e
which every moment rendered more
in&s;upportably cruel. Hardly con&s;cious of
what &s;he was doing, and in&s;en&s;ible of per|&s;onal
fatigue, &s;he had advanced near a
<PB N="260" REF="262">
mile beyond the park, and had partly
cro&s;&s;ed a &s;andy heath, over which the high
road lay, when Je&s;&s;y ha&s;tily cried out that
Cathcart was coming: he &s;aw them at the
&s;ame moment; and ha&s;tening on, leaped
from his hor&s;e as &s;oon as he came near
them.</P>
<P>His countenance was little likely to
quiet their fears: he was as pale as death,
and his lips trembled as he &s;poke to Ce|le&s;tina,
and a&s;&s;ured her, in a voice that
&s;eemed to contradict the words it hardly
articulated, that Mr. Willoughby was
well, perfectly well, and had authori&s;ed
him to &s;ay every thing to her that might
make her ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The hurried manner in which he &s;poke
this, the impre&s;&s;ion of unea&s;ine&s;s on his
countenance, and the improbability that
Willoughby &s;hould be well and not return
him&s;elf, all &s;truck forcibly on the mind of
Cele&s;tina, and convinced her that &s;ome|thing
very fatal had happened. "You
deceive me, Cathcart," cried &s;he in the
<PB N="261" REF="263">
wild and tremulous voice of de&s;pair, "I
know you deceive me. Something very
dreadful has befallen him: he is dead, or
dying: I will go to him, however&mdash;I will
know the wor&s;t."</P>
<P>Cathcart now took her hands, and with
the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s began again to re|peat
his a&s;&s;urances that Willoughby was
not only alive but well. Cele&s;tina, inter|rupting
him, a&s;ked&mdash;"Why then do I
not &s;ee him? why is he detained? and
what bu&s;ine&s;s of fatal import could keep
him &s;o long? Cathcart, I will not, I can|not
be deceived: tell me at once what I
have to &s;uffer, and I will endeavour to bear
it; but this incertitude, the&s;e apprehen|&s;ions,
I cannot endure another hour, nor
another moment.</P>
<P>While this dialogue pa&s;&s;ed, he had taken
one of her arms within his, and having
made a &s;ign to Je&s;&s;y to take the other, they
led her gently towards Alve&s;tone park
gate. Cathcart was &s;ilent for a moment,
as if con&s;idering how he could &s;often the
<PB N="262" REF="264">
&s;hock which it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to
give her; while Cele&s;tina continued im|patiently
urging him to tell her the wor&s;t,
whatever it might be. "Let me repeat
to you, deare&s;t Madam," &s;aid he, "let
me repeat to you, that you have nothing
to fear for the life of our dear friend; and
&s;urely whatever other intelligence I have
to impart&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Other intelligence!" cried Cele&s;tina:
"you have then &s;omething to impart
which all my fortitude is required to &s;u&s;|tain.
Willoughby&mdash;but no! it is im|po&s;&s;ible:
he cannot be unworthy&mdash;he
cannot have cruelly deceived me&mdash;it is
impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;"</P>
<P>"It is indeed," replied Cathcart, "in
my opinion impo&s;&s;ible for Mr. Willoughby
to be guilty of any unworthy action. You,
Mi&s;s de Mornay, have, I am convinced, a
&s;trength of under&s;tanding very uncom|mon&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Cathcart," cried Cele&s;tina with energy,
"this is no time for flattery: prove your
<PB N="263" REF="265">
opinion of my under&s;tanding by daring to
entru&s;t me with this fearful &s;ecret: the
knowledge of it cannot give me &s;o much
pain as your he&s;itation."</P>
<P>"I would very fain obey you!" re|plied
he&punc; "What then will you &s;ay if I tell
you, that, though I am wholly ignorant
of the cau&s;e of a re&s;olution &s;o extraordi|nary,
&s;o unexpected, I am afraid it will
be very long before you &s;ee Willoughby
again, and that he is now many miles
di&s;tant from us; though upon my &s;oul,
by all my hopes here and hereafter, I &s;wear
that I neither know the motives of his de|parture
nor whither he is gone."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, prepared as &s;he was for &s;ome
heavy blow, found this hideous uncer|tainty
more than &s;he could &s;u&s;tain: that
Willoughby &s;hould have quitted her, pro|bably
for ever, without a&s;&s;igning any
cau&s;e, at the very moment they were to
be united; that he &s;hould not him&s;elf have
&s;een her to have &s;oftened the pain this
cruel and unaccountable event mu&s;t in|flict;
<PB N="264" REF="266">
that he &s;hould not even have written
to her, but &s;hould, in this abrupt and un|feeling
way, abandon her to all the mi&s;ery
of endle&s;s conjecture, regret, and di&s;ap|pointment;
were circum&s;tances &s;o unex|pected,
&s;o in&s;upportable, that her rea&s;on,
which would have &s;u&s;tained her in almo&s;t
any other exigence, &s;eemed for a moment
to yield to this: &s;he became extremely
faint, her knees trembled, a cold dew hung
on her forehead, and all the effort &s;he
could make was, to &s;ignify by a motion of
her hand that &s;he could go no farther.</P>
<P>They were then more than half a mile
from the park gate: but the road along
which they were pa&s;&s;ing was worn, and a
bank on either &s;ide offered her a &s;eat. Cath|cart
and Je&s;&s;y &s;at down by her, both &s;ilent,
and almo&s;t as much affected as &s;he was.
She leaned her head on Je&s;&s;y, and after a
moment a deep &s;igh a little relieved her.
She turned her eyes mournfully on Cathcart,
with an expre&s;&s;ion he perfectly under&s;tood,
as &s;eeming to &s;ay, tell me all&mdash;and I will
try to endure it.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267">
"Do not think, I conjure you, my dear
Madam," continued he, "that the ardent
and tender affection of Mr. Willoughby for
you is dimini&s;hed. Were it po&s;&s;ible for me
to do ju&s;tice to the agonies I &s;aw him in,
when he told me that a &s;trange nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;a
nece&s;&s;ity he could not explain&mdash;compelled
him to quit you;&mdash;if language could de|&s;cribe
the wretchedne&s;s in which he &s;eemed
to be involved&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Do not de&s;cribe it, dear Cathcart,"
&s;aid Cele&s;tina, &s;peaking with difficulty. "I
can bear my own mi&s;ery, terrible as it is,
better than the thoughts of his."</P>
<P>"Mitigate his &s;ufferings then, amiable
Mi&s;s de Mornay," interrupted Cathcart,
"by collecting all your fortitude, and re|membering
how much reliance you ought
to have on his honour and his affection;
and let me be able to &s;ay, when I write to
him, that this &s;ad &s;eparation has not injured
your health, nor your opinion of him: be|lieve
me, &s;uch is the only intelligence that
can admini&s;ter any con&s;olation to the torn
heart of my noble friend."</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="268">
"I will try then, Cathcart, that he &s;hall
have it. You know where to write to him?
He expects to hear from you, and from me
he wi&s;hes not to hear?"</P>
<P>"He told me," rea&s;&s;umed Cathcart,
"that as &s;oon as he was able he would
write to you him&s;elf: that he was going
immediately to London: whither he &s;hould
go afterwards he knew not; but that a hate|ful
my&s;tery&mdash;Then he &s;topped; &s;eemed
to repent having &s;aid &s;o much; charged me
to a&s;&s;ure you of his everla&s;ting affection;
&s;tarted from his &s;eat; walked about the
room wildly; then again repeated his charge
to me that I would not leave you, or &s;uffer
Je&s;&s;y to leave you, but that you would re|main
at Alve&s;tone till you heard from him:
again he he&s;itated, doubted, and wringing
my hand, a&s;ked me, with di&s;turbed looks
and in a tremulous voice, if ever wretched|ne&s;s
equalled his. I would have be&s;ought
him to tell me from whence it aro&s;e; but
as if fore&s;eeing whither my enquiry would
tend, he &s;topped me: "Cathcart," cried he,
<PB N="267" REF="269">
"you know I have great confidence in you,
and that I would entru&s;t you with this fatal
my&s;tery, which I go now to clear up; but
I have &s;worn never to divulge the cau&s;e of
my&mdash;what can I &s;ay?&mdash;Oh! Cele&s;tina!
be&s;t and lovelie&s;t of human beings! what
mu&s;t be tho&s;e &s;ufferings which Willoughby
dares not communicate to you!&mdash;which
your pity and tenderne&s;s&mdash;" Again he
broke off, and hurried out of the room.
He returned, however, in a few moments,
&s;omewhat more calm; and alarmed as I
had been by his agitation, by the wild ea|gerne&s;s
of his manner, and the incoherence
of his words, I thought it better to &s;oothe
him than to attempt to obtain an explanation
which it co&s;t him &s;o much even to
&s;peak of: I contented my&s;elf therefore with
a&s;&s;uring him of my implicit obedience to
all his commands, and of my conviction
that whatever might be your di&s;tre&s;s and
anxiety, you would acquie&s;ce in all his
wi&s;hes, and that your reliance on him, your
affection for him, would not be &s;haken by
<PB N="268" REF="270">
this involuntary &s;eparation, which, dear
Sir, continued I, will &s;urely be temporary
only; I was going on, but he checked
me&mdash;"I know not," &s;aid he, with quick|ne&s;s&mdash;"I
know not&mdash;involuntary, God
knows it is, but <HI>when</HI> it will end!&mdash;Oh
Cele&s;tina! is this the day which I have with
&s;o much delight anticipated!" He now
&s;truck his open hand on his forehead, again
&s;tarted away from me, and again relap&s;ed
into all the agonies of &s;orrow."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina had not hitherto &s;hed a tear.
Stunned by the greatne&s;s and &s;ingularity of
her misfortune, terrified by the evil, which
its ob&s;curity rendered doubly fearful, her
&s;en&s;es were for &s;ome moments &s;u&s;pended;
but Willoughby weeping, and in de&s;pair&mdash;Willoughby
torn from her by an invi&s;ible
and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s hand&mdash;awakened all her ten|derne&s;s,
and tears filled her eyes, as, with a
deep &s;igh, &s;he ca&s;t them towards heaven,
and with cla&s;ped hands and in a faint voice
cried&mdash;"Wherever he goes&mdash;what&s;oever
he does&mdash;may God protect and ble&s;s him;
<PB N="269" REF="271">
and if the remembrance of poor Cele&s;tina
cau&s;es him any unhappine&s;s, may he for|get
her. Indeed, Cathcart," added &s;he,
"indeed his happine&s;s, and not my own,
has been always the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart."
She would have gone on, but her voice failed
her. After a moment's &s;ilence, however,
&s;he &s;eemed to have found &s;ome degree of
fortitude and &s;trength&mdash;"Let us return to
the hou&s;e, my dear Je&s;&s;y," &s;aid &s;he, "while
I am able, and let us there con&s;ider what it
will be right to do."</P>
<P>Cathcart, glad to &s;ee her more compo&s;ed
than he had dared to hope, now again led
her forward with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Je&s;&s;y.
But their help &s;eemed no longer requi|&s;ite:
&s;he hurried on with as much quick|ne&s;s
as if &s;he expected her &s;u&s;pen&s;e to be
terminated on her reaching the hou&s;e;
where &s;he arrived, out of breath, trembling,
and agitated. She &s;poke not, but hurried
through the hall into the library, where
they u&s;ually &s;at; and there the fir&s;t object
that &s;truck her was Mr. Thorold, the clergy|man
<PB N="270" REF="272">
man who had been engaged to marry them,
the &s;ame who had, at the reque&s;t of Wil|loughby,
&s;o effectually exerted his zeal and
friend&s;hip in introducing Je&s;&s;y Woodburn
to her grandfather, and of who&s;e &s;ociety
Willoughby was very fond.</P>
<P>He laid down his book on the entrance
of Cele&s;tina, and prepared to &s;alute her with
cheerful congratulations, for it was not now
more than eight o'clock; he had put his
hor&s;e into the &s;table him&s;elf as was his cu&s;|tom,
and walked into the library, where he
had been &s;ome time expecting Willoughby,
and began to wonder, as he was a very
early ri&s;er, at his delay.</P>
<P>All ideas of bridal fe&s;tivity however were
driven from his mind the moment he be|held
the countenance of Cele&s;tina. "My
dear Mi&s;s De Mornay," cried he, approach|ing
her, "are you ill?&mdash;has any thing hap|pened?"
Cele&s;tina, &s;truck by the &s;ight of
him, could not an&s;wer, but &s;at down in the
fir&s;t chair &s;he found, and Cathcart, &s;eeing
how greatly &s;he was affected, took Mr.
<PB N="271" REF="273">
Thorold by the arm and led him into the
garden.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina in the mean time leaning
again&s;t Je&s;&s;y, who hung weeping over her,
attempted again to recover her re&s;olution
and compo&s;ure. She &s;ighed deeply. "Je&s;&s;y,
my love," &s;aid &s;he, when &s;he could com|mand
her voice, "I wi&s;h to return to
Thorpe Heath. Methinks I am now an
intruder here: &s;end, therefore, for &s;ome
conveyance for me; and think for me, my
dear friend, for I fear I am incapable of
judging for my&s;elf."</P>
<P>The timid and &s;oft tempered Je&s;&s;y was but
little likely to direct or &s;upport her. "Let
us, deare&s;t Madam," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;peak to
Cathcart again before you take any re&s;olu|tion:
let us hear Mr. Thorold's opinion."</P>
<P>"Do you then attend them for that
purpo&s;e," replied Cele&s;tina, "for my&s;elf, I
cannot hear them. I &s;hould I think be
better were I left alone for a few moments:
I will go, therefore, to my own room&mdash;my
own room? alas! I have none in this hou&s;e!
<PB N="272" REF="274">
Let me go, however, Je&s;&s;y, to that which
I u&s;ed to call mine. I would recall my
di&s;&s;ipated and di&s;tracted &s;pirits, I would ac|quire
&s;ome degree of rea&s;on and re&s;igna|tion;
and &s;ince wretchedne&s;s is now irrevo|cably
mine, I would teach this rebellious
heart to &s;ubmit to it."</P>
<P>Je&s;&s;y an&s;wered not; and Cele&s;tina ri&s;ing,
walked &s;lowly through the hall, leaning on
her friend's arm, towards the &s;tair ca&s;e.
As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;aw Willoughby's hat
and gloves on the table where he generally
placed them; a book he had been reading
to her, as they &s;auntered in the garden the
preceding day, lay by them: Cele&s;tina
&s;tarted as if a &s;pectre had met her: the pain|ful
contra&s;t between her pre&s;ent &s;ituation
and that of a few hours before &s;truck her
forcibly: &s;he &s;huddered, and &s;natching up
the book, ha&s;tened away with it, as if &s;he
apprehended &s;omebody would take it from
her.</P>
<P>When they reached the door of the apart|ment
which &s;he had cho&s;en for her dre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="273" REF="275">
room, &s;he turned to Je&s;&s;y, and with a me|lancholy
and forced compo&s;ure bade her
adieu for an hour. "You will go, my
dear," &s;aid &s;he, "to Mr. Thorold and
Mr. Cathcart, and &s;ay to the former, with
my compliments, that I will endeavour to
&s;ee him if he will be kind enough to &s;tay
till ten o'clock and breakfa&s;t here, and tell
him too that I depend much on his friendly
advice, and that it cannot be given to any
being who wants it more or will be more
&s;en&s;ible of it's value."</P>
