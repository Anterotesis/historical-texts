<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady SNEERWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE paragraphs, you &s;ay, Mr. Snake, were all
in&s;erted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were, Madam; and as I copied them
my&s;elf in a &s;eigned hand, there can be no &s;u&s;picion
from whence they came.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you circulate the report of Lady
Brittle's intrigue with Captain Boa&s;tall?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's in as fine a train as your Lady&s;hip could
wi&s;h; in the common cour&s;e of things, I think it mu&s;t
reach Mrs. Clacket's ears within twenty-four hours,
and then the bu&s;ine&s;s, you know, is as good as done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, Mrs. Clacket has talents,
and a great deal of indu&s;try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>True Madam, and has been tolerably &s;uc|ce&s;sful
in her day; to my knowledge &s;he has been the
cau&s;e of &s;ix matches being broken off, and three &s;ons
di&s;inherited; of four forced elopments, as many clo&s;e
confinements, nine &s;eparate maintenances, and two di|vorces;
&mdash;nay, I have more than once traced her cau|&s;ing
a <HI>tete a tete</HI> in the Town and Country Magazine,
<PB N="4" REF="4">
when the parties never &s;aw one another before in the
whole cour&s;e of their lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, &s;he has genius, but her
manner is too gro&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam; &s;he has a fine tongue, and a
bold invention; but then her colouring is too dark,
and the outlines rather too extravagant; &s;he wants that
delicacy of hint, and mellowne&s;s of &s;neer, which di&s;|tingui&s;hes
your Lady&s;hip's &s;candal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are partial, Snake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the lea&s;t; every body will allow that
Lady Sneerwell can do more with a word or look than
many others with the mo&s;t laboured detail, even though
they accidentally happen to have a little truth on their
&s;ide to &s;upport it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear Snake, and I'll not deny
the plea&s;ure I feel at the &s;ucce&s;s of my &s;chemes; <STAGE>(<HI>both
ri&s;e</HI>)</STAGE> wounded my&s;elf, in the early part of my life, by
the envenomed tongue of &s;lander, I confe&s;s nothing
can give me greater &s;atisfaction, than reducing others
to the level of my own injured reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam; but there is one affair, in
which you have lately employed me, wherein, I confe&s;s,
I am at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s at your motives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pre&s;ume you mean with regard to my
friend Sir Peter Teazle, and his family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do; here are two young men, to whom Sir
Peter has acted as guardian &s;ince their father's death;
the elde&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t amiable character, and
univer&s;ally well &s;poken of; the younge&s;t the mo&s;t di&s;|&s;ipated,
wild, extravagant young fellow in the world;
the former an avowed admirer of your Lady&s;hip, and
apparently your favourite; the latter attached to Maria,
Sir Peter's ward, and confe&s;&s;edly admired by her: Now,
<PB N="5" REF="5">
on the face of the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is utterly un|accountable
to me, why you, the widow of a city
Knight, with a large fortune, &s;hould not immediately
clo&s;e with the pa&s;&s;ion of a man of &s;uch character and
expectation as Mr. Surface; and more &s;o, why you are
&s;o uncommonly earne&s;t to de&s;troy the mutual attach|ment
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting between his brother Charles and Maria.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then at once, to unravel this my&s;tery,
I mu&s;t inform you, that love has no &s;hare whatever in
the intercour&s;e between Mr. Surface and me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! his real views are to Maria, or
her fortune, while in his brother he finds a favoured
rival; he is, therefore, obliged to ma&s;k his real inten|tions,
and profit by my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet &s;till I am more puzzled why you &s;hould
intere&s;t your&s;elf for his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! how dull you are! can't you
&s;urmi&s;e a weakne&s;s I have hitherto through &s;hame con|cealed
even from you? Mu&s;t I confe&s;s it that Charles,
that profligate, that libertine, that bankrupt in fortune
and reputation, that he it is for whom I am thus anxi|ous
and malicious; and to gain whom I would &s;acrifice
every thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, indeed, your conduct appears con&s;i&s;t|ent;
but pray how came you and Mr. Surface &s;o con|fidential?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>For our mutual intere&s;t; he pretends
to, and recommends &s;entiment and liberality, but I
know him to be artful, clo&s;e and malicious. In &s;hort,
a &s;entimental knave, while with Sir Peter, and indeed
with mo&s;t of his acquaintances he pa&s;&s;es for a youth|ful
miracle of virtue, good &s;en&s;e, and benevolence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I know Sir Peter vows he has not his
fellow in England, and has prai&s;ed him as a man of
character and &s;entiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and with the appearance of be|ing
&s;entimental, he has brought Sir Peter to favour his
addre&s;&s;es to Maria, while poor Charles has no friend
in the hou&s;e, though I fear he has a powerful one in
Maria's heart, again&s;t whom we mu&s;t direct our
&s;chemes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SERVANT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Surface, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shew him up <STAGE>(<HI>exit Servant</HI>)</STAGE> he ge|nerally
calls about this hour&mdash;I don't wonder at peo|ple's
giving him to me for a lover.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> JOSEPH SURFACE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Sneerwell, good morning to you&mdash;
Mr. Snake your mo&s;t obedient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Snake has ju&s;t been rallying me up|on
our attachment, but I have told him our real views;
I need not tell you how u&s;eful he has been to us, and
believe me, our confidence has not been ill placed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;u&s;|pect
a man of Mr. Snake's merit and accompli&s;h|ments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no compliments; but tell me
when you &s;aw Maria, or what's more material to us,
your brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not &s;een either &s;ince I left you, but I
can tell you they never met; &s;ome of your &s;tories have
had a good effect in that quarter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>The merit of this, my dear Snake, be|longs
to you; but do your brother's di&s;tre&s;&s;es increa&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every hour! I am told he had another exe|cution
<PB N="7" REF="7">
in his hou&s;e ye&s;terday&mdash;in &s;hort, his di&s;&s;ipation
and extravagance exceeds any thing I ever heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Charles!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Poor Charles indeed! notwith&s;tand|ing
his extravagance one cannot help pitying him; I
wi&s;h it was in my power to be of any e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice
to him; for the man who does not feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es
of a brother, even though merited by his own mi&s;|conduct,
de&s;erves to be&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you are going to be moral, and
forget you are among friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad, &s;o I was, ha! ha!&mdash;I'll keep that
&s;entiment till I &s;ee Sir Peter, ha! ha! however it
would certainly be a generous act in you to re&s;cue
Maria from &s;uch a libertine, who, if he is to be re|claimed
at all, can only be &s;o by a per&s;on of your &s;u|perior
accompli&s;hments and under&s;tanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe Lady Sneerwell, here's company
coming; I'll go and copy the letter I mentioned to
your Lady&s;hip. Mr. Surface, your mo&s;t obedient.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit Snake.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Snake, your mo&s;t obedient. I wonder
Lady Sneerwell, you would put any confidence in
that fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have di&s;covered he has of late had &s;everal
conferences with old Rowley, who was formerly my
father's &s;teward; he has never, you know, been a
friend of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think he would betray us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not unlikely; and take my word for it,
Lady Sneerwell, that fellow has not virtue enough to
be faithful to his own villanies.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="8" REF="8">
<HI>Enter</HI> MARIA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Maria, my dear, how do you do?
What's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, Madam, only this odious lover of
mine, Sir Benjamin Backbite, and his uncle Crabtree,
ju&s;t called in at my guardian's; but I took the fir&s;t op|portunity
to &s;lip out, and run away to your Lady&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had my brother Charles been of the party
you would not have been &s;o much alarmed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now you are too &s;evere; for I
dare &s;ay the truth of the matter is, Maria heard you
was here, and therefore came; but pray Maria, what
particular objection have you to Sir Benjamin, that you
avoid him &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam, he has done nothing; but his
whole conver&s;ation is a perpetual libel upon all his
acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the wor&s;t of it is, there is no ad|vantage
in not knowing him, for he would abu&s;e a
&s;tranger as &s;oon as his be&s;t friend, and his uncle is as
bad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I own wit loo&s;es its re&s;pect
with me, when I &s;ee it in company with malice;&mdash;
what think you Mr. Surface?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure, Madam,&mdash;to &s;mile at a je&s;t that
plants a thorn in the brea&s;t of another, is to become a
principal in the mi&s;chief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pa&s;h&mdash;there is no po&s;&s;ibility of being
witty without a little ill nature; the malice in a good
thing is the barb that makes it &s;tick.&mdash;What is your
<HI>real</HI> opinion, Mr. Surface?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my opinion is, that where the &s;pirit
<PB N="9" REF="9">
of railery is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the conver&s;ation mu&s;t be natu|rally
in&s;ipid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well I will not an&s;wer how far &s;lander may
be allowed, but in a man, I am &s;ure it is de&s;picable.&mdash;
We have pride, envy, rival&s;hip, and a thou&s;and mo|tives
to depreciate each other; but the male &s;landerer,
mu&s;t have the cowardice of a woman, before he can
traduce one.</P>

Now, Maria, here's a character to your ta&s;te; though
Mrs. Candour is a little talkative, yet every body al|lows
&s;he is the be&s;t natured &s;ort of woman in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;with the very gro&s;s affectation of
good nature, &s;he does more mi&s;chief than the direct
malice of old Crabtree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo&s;eph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith it's very true; and whenever I hear
the current of abu&s;e running hard again&s;t the characters
of my be&s;t friends I never think them in &s;uch danger,
as when Candour undertakes their defence.</P>

<P>Aye, &s;o am I child&mdash;but what can

agreeably together as they did.</P>

<P>I am &s;ure &s;uch reports are without foun|dation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, &s;o the&s;e things generally are:
&mdash;It's like Mr. Fa&s;hion's affair with Colonel Goterie;
though, indeed, that affair was never rightly cleared
up; and it was but ye&s;terday Mi&s;s Prim a&s;&s;ured me,
that Mr. and Mrs. Honeymoon were now become mere
man and wife, like the re&s;t of their acquaintance. She
likewi&s;e hinted, that a certain widow in the next &s;treet,
had got rid of her drop&s;y, and recovered her &s;hape in
a mo&s;t &s;urprizing manner.</P>

<P>The licence of invention, &s;ome people give
them&s;elves, is a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis &s;o&mdash;but how will you &s;top
people's tongues? 'Twas but ye&s;terday Mrs. Clacket
informed me, that our old friend, Mi&s;s Prudely, was
going to elope, and that her guardian caught her ju&s;t
&s;tepping into the York Diligence, with her dancing|ma&s;ter.
I was informed too, that Lord Flim&s;ey caught
his wife at a hou&s;e of no extraordinary fame, and that
Tom Saunter and Sir Harry Idle, were to mea&s;ure
&s;words on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion.&mdash;But I dare &s;ay there is
no truth in the &s;tory, and I would not circulate &s;uch
a report for the world.</P>

<P>Why, Sir, this Mr. Stanley was a near re|lation
of their mother's, and formerly an eminent mer|chant
in Dublin&mdash;he failed in trade, and is greatly
reduced; he has applied by letter to Mr. Surface and
Charles for a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;from the former of whom he
has received nothing but fair promi&s;es; while Charles
in the mid&s;t of his own di&s;tre&s;&s;es, is at pre&s;ent endea|vouring
to rai&s;e a &s;um of money, part of which I know
he intends for the u&s;e of Mr. Stanley.</P>

<P>Now, Sir, we propo&s;e, that Sir Oliver &s;hall
vi&s;it them both, in the character of Mr. Stanley, as I
<PB N="34" REF="34">
have informed them he has obtained leave of his credi|tors
to wait on his friends in per&s;on&mdash;and in the
younger, believe me, you'll find one, who, in the mid&s;t
of di&s;&s;ipation and extravagance, has &s;till, as our im|mortal

<P>Why Sir, I have per&s;uaded him, there's
no pro&s;pect of his being paid &s;everal &s;ums of money he
has advanced for Charles, but through the bounty of

<P>Well,&mdash;aver&s;e to &s;entiments, as I am

nothing more than having been a while mi&s;taken for
an hone&s;t man; but it would be better, for the con|tinuance
and completion of his happine&s;s, were he to
become, for life, and in reality, what he has only
&s;eemed to be.</P>
