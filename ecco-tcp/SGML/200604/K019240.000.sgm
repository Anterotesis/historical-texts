<HEAD>REFLECTIONS
ON THE
Late alarming BANKRUPTCIES in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WAR, famine, and pe&s;tilence, u&s;ed
formerly to fill up the number of
the general calamities of man|kind;
but, in the pre&s;ent age,
one has been added, <HI>viz.</HI> Bankruptcy. The
year 1772 will ever be remembered as a
year of confu&s;ion, di&s;may, and di&s;tre&s;s. All
<HI>Scotland</HI> has been &s;haken by a kind of com|mercial
earthquake, while, like a company
connected by an electrical wire, the people
in every corner of the country have almo&s;t
in&s;tantaneou&s;ly received the &s;ame &s;hock.</P>
<P>But it is to be feared that the evil has as
yet had very little effect, in compari&s;on of
what it will have. The term of <HI>Martinmas</HI>
is ju&s;t at hand, and that of <HI>Candlemas</HI> is not
far off: at the&s;e terms payments mu&s;t and
will be demanded; and there is great rea|&s;on
to apprehend, that very mi&s;erable con|&s;equences
will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>There cannot therefore be a fitter &s;ubject
than that which I have cho&s;en, for a pam|phlet
<PB N="2" REF="5">
of &s;uch a &s;ize as to be ea&s;ily purcha&s;ed
and generally read. In times of national
di&s;tre&s;s, there have been very u&s;eful hints
&s;ugge&s;ted by individuals: It is related, that
during the famous &s;iege of <HI>Leyden,</HI> when the
inhabitants, who then defended them&s;elves
with a mo&s;t determined bravery, were me|ditating
a &s;urrender, becau&s;e they were in
ab&s;olute want of provi&s;ion, an aged citizen
of no con&s;iderable note &s;tept forth, and told
them, that while there remained an old &s;hoe
within the walls they &s;hould not give up,
for that he had for &s;everal days &s;upported
him&s;elf by leather, boiled long enough
to become tender, which though not a very
palatable di&s;h, afforded &s;ufficient nouri&s;h|ment
to prevent him from &s;tarving: The
experiment was made, and found to &s;ucceed,
and thus the city was enabled to hold out;
till relieved by the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>At &s;uch times too the minds of men are
more than u&s;ually di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to &s;ober
advice, and profit by friendly in&s;truction;
and therefore it may be hoped that the&s;e
few pages will meet with an agreeable re|ception.</P>
<P>The public odium is at pre&s;ent directed
again&s;t that cla&s;s of men called <HI>bankers</HI>; but
it were to be wi&s;hed that a proper di&s;tinc|tion
were made between true and fal&s;e, or
real and fictitious bankers. Tho&s;e of the
former kind are de&s;cribed in &s;o ju&s;t and
<PB N="3" REF="6">
lively a manner by a writer in England,
that his words &s;hall be tran&s;cribed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>Bankers are an honourable and an u&s;e|ful
&s;et of men in civil &s;ociety, and ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a trading nation
as ours: they in turn tru&s;t the Lord, the
merchant, and the mechanic, with &s;ums
that give life, vigour, and di&s;patch to bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Banking is a mo&s;t laudable, u&s;eful, and
advantageous refinement on bu&s;ine&s;s. It
collects together &s;ums of u&s;ele&s;s ca&s;h, and
brings a large fund into circulation, which
otherwi&s;e mu&s;t lie unemployed for the
time each man may not want it; or, in
other words, the Iodgments at a banker's
&s;hop are made up of &s;uch &s;ums as each of
his cu&s;tomers may not want for the pre|&s;ent
hour. The general fund aids every
man in turn, in proportion to his credit,
and interchangeably &s;erves each his pur|po&s;es,
as their various occa&s;ions may at
different periods require: like a large re|&s;ervoir
made up from &s;mall &s;hallow and
u&s;ele&s;s rivulets, it &s;upplies all its neigh|bours
in plentiful draughts, &s;atisfies their
common and extraordinary wants at each
man's requi&s;ition, and then turns that
which was before beneficial to no one in|to
a wonderful and exten&s;ive advantage.</P>
<P>Bankers are generally entitled to confi|dence
by fair character, a clo&s;e attention
<PB N="4" REF="7">
to bu&s;ine&s;s, and by fortunes of their own;
which not only give &s;ecurity, but are in|terwoven
and blended with the credit and
various purpo&s;es of their cu&s;tomers and
friends.</P></Q></P>
<P>Such are real bankers; and although we
have none exactly &s;uch in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet we
have among us &s;everal merchants who an|&s;wer
the &s;ame purpo&s;es, in &s;omewhat a dif|ferent
form, and I &s;hall hold <HI>them</HI> as real
bankers on whom we can depend. Let us
comfort our&s;elves that we have a few &s;uch
among us. The late convul&s;ions of the com|mercial
world have winnowed our traders,
and &s;eparated the wheat from the chaff: we
now know the men of &s;ub&s;tance&mdash;of know|ledge
in bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;of prudence, to confine
their views within moderate bounds&mdash;and,
let me add, of hone&s;ty. A few &s;uch men
we have, and let us e&s;teem them accord|ingly.</P>
<P>On the other hand, what &s;hall be &s;aid of
tho&s;e who have held them&s;elves forth to the
world as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good &s;tocks, while, at
the &s;ame time, they were con&s;cious that
they were wor&s;e than nothing? who, in or|der
to carry on the cheat, and at the &s;ame
time gratify the wretched vanity of figuring
for a while in borrowed feathers, have lived
with a degree of elegance, becoming in peo|ple
of the fir&s;t rank, but ridiculous and of|fen&s;ive
in men of low extraction: Such un|principled
<PB N="5" REF="8">
men having been entru&s;ted with
the money of numbers, and with the <HI>all</HI> of
&s;ome, have villanou&s;ly con&s;umed it, and
involved their creditors in the &s;ame ruin,
though not in the &s;ame guilt, with them|&s;elves:
On &s;uch men let the con&s;equences
of their di&s;hone&s;ty fall heavy, for me. How
incon&s;i&s;tent is it, that in a country where
we hang a man who &s;teals or robs to the ex|tent
of a trifle, we &s;hould be &s;o tender to
<HI>fraudulent bankrupts,</HI> though they have actual|ly
deprived their neighbours of &s;ums enor|mous,
and occa&s;ioned univer&s;al and deep
di&s;tre&s;s. I will, however, do what is in my
power to &s;how that I can di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween
good and evil: I am not to be &s;ooth|ed
by the whining of their artful emi&s;&s;a|ries,
to accept of a paultry compo&s;ition,
and &s;uffer <HI>them</HI> to live at large; nay, better
than I can afford to do: No;&mdash;for the &s;ake
of ju&s;tice, for the &s;ake of deterring them,
and &s;uch corrupt, hard-hearted impo&s;tors
from again making a prey of their neigh|bours,
my voice is, <HI>Spare not:</HI> If they will
&s;trut, let it be in pri&s;on; if they will be
merry, let it be within tho&s;e walls where
culprits dwell, as well-born, as remor&s;ele&s;s,
and as jovial as they.</P>
<P>Yet let us not forget that there are a few
unfortunate; a few who&s;e ruin has been oc|ca&s;ioned
through their connections with the
unworthy. For the&s;e I can make all the
<PB N="6" REF="9">
allowance that the tendere&s;t humanity would
wi&s;h: But let us be &s;ure that the excu&s;e is
true, before we di&s;pen&s;e with the puni&s;hment.
The compa&s;&s;ionate remedy of a <HI>Ce&s;&s;io-bonorum</HI>
is not granted but to &s;uch debtors as have
<HI>proved that their failure has been occa&s;ioned through
misfortune.</HI> We mu&s;t have &s;ome evidence in
favour of all our bankrupts or in&s;olvent
debtors, or by whatever other name they
chu&s;e to pa&s;s, before they have our indul|gence.
What that evidence &s;hould be I do
not pretend to define, I leave it to the con|&s;cience
of every enquirer; I my&s;elf am a|greeably
&s;atisfied with the innocence of &s;ome:
Woe be to tho&s;e villains who have thrown a
cloud of &s;u&s;picion over all, and made it &s;o
hard for the truly hone&s;t to get them&s;elves
di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Although men in trade have been the
prominent and fir&s;t-di&s;covered victims in the
late broad and &s;udden cru&s;h; we have al|ready
&s;een &s;everal men of other profe&s;&s;ions,
and &s;ome too of the lowe&s;t, throwing their
&s;hattered per&s;onal e&s;tates into the Court of
Se&s;&s;ion, which by the new bankrupt-act
is become the perpetual light-hou&s;e for tem|pe&s;tuous
fortunes, and univer&s;al guardian
of &s;hip-wrecked goods. Were none but
traders &s;wallowed up in this gulf of bank|ruptcy,
le&s;s would be my regret; but it is
a melancholy truth, that almo&s;t all will be
&s;ufferers in a greater or le&s;&s;er degrace; for, I
<PB N="7" REF="10">
am &s;orry to &s;ay it, that almo&s;t all are ad|venturers
in the article of money and cre|dit;
owing either to extravagance, negli|gence,
or the de&s;ire of being precipitantly
rich.</P>
<P>Of the extravagance of certain men I have
already &s;poken with a due &s;everity; but I
am coming round, and &s;hall have a word
with mo&s;t of my neighbours. The mi&s;chief
is, that for &s;ome years pa&s;t there has been
in Scotland an abominable &s;pirit of levelling
all tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which ages of civilized
&s;ociety have, through all the gradations of
politene&s;s introduced among&s;t mankind.
<Q><L>Ill fares the land, to ha&s;t'ning ills a prey,</L>
<L>Where wealth accumulates and men decay;</L></Q>
&s;ays Dr. <HI>Gold&s;mith:</HI> and I apply his elegant
lines to the decay of gentlemen. Ever &s;ince
the &s;eat of government has been removed
from among us, we have been encrea&s;ing
in riches and barbarity, as a body in pro|portion
as it grows fat becomes coar&s;e. In|tere&s;t
or amu&s;ement draw the greate&s;t num|ber
of our people of fa&s;hion up to London;
and tho&s;e who remain are hardly to be per|ceived,
as mo&s;t of them &s;uffer them&s;elves
to mingle undi&s;tingui&s;hed with the general
ma&s;s. Up&s;tarts, who have picked up for|tunes
abroad they be&s;t know how, and pup|pies
at home, who have obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of wealth by various means, have fla&s;hed a|mong
<PB N="8" REF="11">
us with all the &s;plendor of prodigality,
lavi&s;hing away perhaps in one week as much
as &s;upported their father's family, and might
&s;till &s;upport a family of their neare&s;t relations
for a whole year. Our real gentry, who
have had every mechanical bu&s;ine&s;s, nay, in
&s;ome in&s;tances, every &s;ervile office, perform|ed
to them by the fathers of the&s;e men, have
been mean enough to a&s;&s;ociate with them as
equals, and fooli&s;h enough to vie with them
in expence, till drowned in debt, their lands
have fallen to the lot of the&s;e very people.
And hence it has happened that there is no
di&s;tinction of tables, as there is no di&s;tinc|tion
of ranks; all mu&s;t have an equal num|ber
of di&s;hes, all mu&s;t have wines equally
co&s;tly, as all think them&s;elves equally <HI>gentle|men,</HI>
as the word is now u&s;ed; &s;o that it may
be ju&s;tly &s;aid, Our fea&s;ts are noble, and our
manners plebeian. This, though an iron
age with a vengeance, in the true &s;en&s;e of
the expre&s;&s;ion, is, in one re&s;pect, a golden
age; for gold is the object on which all in|clinations
are fixed, and which procures all
tho&s;e advantages, which, in times of higher
&s;pirit and nobler &s;entiments, no riches could
obtain: I have &s;aid that gold procures &s;uch
advantages&mdash;I would alter the phra&s;e a lit|tle;
for, from the very nature of things, the
genuine di&s;tinction which good birth com|mands
cannot be the &s;ubject of commerce;
therefore the low-born enjoy it not, as it
<PB N="9" REF="12">
can never be acquired; but, like the com|pliant
drunken companion, who &s;aid to his
friend who had fallen upon the ground,
'I cannot help you up, but I'll lie down
be&s;ide you,' our people of birth bring
them&s;elves to a level with the mean; &s;o that
when the genuine honours due to birth are
de&s;troyed, gold may then purcha&s;e every
thing that remains.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> there is a court; in <HI>Ireland</HI> the
repre&s;entation of a court, which nearly an|&s;wers
the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and in both the&s;e
countries a di&s;tinction of ranks is pre&s;erved;
whereas in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> except at a dancing|ma&s;ter's
ball, the weekly a&s;&s;embly for dan|cing,
or the annual levee of his Maje&s;ty's
commi&s;&s;ioner to the general a&s;&s;embly of the
kirk, and &s;ometimes a funeral, there is not
the lea&s;t room for precedency. I do not de|&s;ire
to have a lord-lieutenant; but I could
wi&s;h that we had &s;ome deputy at the palace
of Holyrood-hou&s;e, to keep us a little in mind
of the di&s;tinction of ranks. However &s;ome
factious &s;pirits may attempt to de&s;troy it, our
government, limited as it is, is certainly a
monarchical government, and, until it is &s;o|lemnly
changed to another, we ought to keep
alive the true &s;pirit of it, which cannot be
done without ob&s;erving the di&s;tinction of
ranks. "In a monarchical &s;tate, (&s;ays an
ingenious French writer,) are two orders,
e&s;&s;entially &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, the nobles
<PB N="10" REF="13">
and the plebeians: the functions of the for|mer
are to defend it; tho&s;e of the latter to
feed and to enrich it, without ever a&s;piring
to u&s;ele&s;s honours, which are not made for
them"</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould tho&s;e of the inferior ranks of
life think them&s;elves di&s;paraged, or treated
with tyrannical contempt, when they are
kept apart from tho&s;e whom they ought ha|bitually
to reverence: They may be e&s;teemed
as reputable men in their &s;tation, while they
remain in their own places with content|ment
and quietne&s;s, and do not fret their
minds by a vain and re&s;tle&s;s contention for
equality. They may lead perhaps as com|fortable
lives as tho&s;e above them, and if
ambition &s;tirs within them, they may feed
it with &s;ome probability, while they plea&s;e
them&s;elves with the idea, that the wealth
acquired by their indu&s;try may lay the foun|dation
of a family, which, in a long cour&s;e
of time, may be as re&s;pectable and noble as
any.</P>
<P>Let me not be branded as a niggard, or
an un&s;ocial fellow, for what I am now going
to &s;ay. Take it as you plea&s;e, I am per&s;ua|ded,
that there is truth and ju&s;tice in the
remark, that one great &s;ource of extrava|gance
at pre&s;ent is the practice of exten&s;ive
and indi&s;criminate entertaining, which pre|vails
among&s;t us. I remember the time,
when no body dined or &s;upped at our
<PB N="11" REF="14">
hou&s;es, but relations or particular friends
and connections, except at the hou&s;es of men
of high rank, or in public offices, who were
therefore obliged, in point of decorum, and
for the purpo&s;es of good policy, to give en|tertainments
to large and general compa|nies.
Indifferent people paid us a morning
vi&s;it, or drank a di&s;h of tea at our hou&s;es in
the afternoon. Whereas now, what a wide
circle of dining and &s;upping acquaintance
has every one of us!A man re&s;olves on
having a dinner or a &s;upper. He &s;ends
about cards, and he is never at re&s;t till he
has &s;ecured as many as will fill his table.
The &s;lighte&s;t acquaintance &s;uffices for giving
and receiving &s;uch invitations; and, from
their being &s;o promi&s;cuous, and &s;uch a con|tinual
round of them, true ho&s;pitality no
longer exi&s;ts. We a&s;k chiefly tho&s;e who will
a&s;k us again, and we a&s;k &s;o many, that with
one half of them we have no connection,
and no &s;uch reciprocation of regard as
&s;hould be found between the ma&s;ter of a
hou&s;e and his gue&s;ts. On the contrary, it is
very common to find them attack each other
behind their backs, if not with rancorous
abu&s;e, at lea&s;t with bitter &s;arca&s;m, or deba|&s;ing
buffoonery:<Q>Non ho&s;pes ab ho&s;pite tutus.</Q></P>
<P>Such indi&s;criminate entertaining is the
wor&s;e, that not only do we think our&s;elves
obliged to have our tables more plentifully
<PB N="12" REF="15">
covered than in mo&s;t hou&s;es in London, but
we mu&s;t drink hard upon almo&s;t every oc|ca&s;ion.
I will venture to &s;ay, that there is
at this time more hard-drinking in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
than in any other country in Europe, <HI>Ire|land</HI>
not excepted. The regular artillery of
the gla&s;&s;es, the bumpers, the varieties of
toa&s;ting in &s;hort all the
<Q>Pride, pomp, and circum&s;tance of glorious drinking,</Q>
are &s;till in full ob&s;ervance among&s;t us. It
may &s;eem extraordinary, that this fa&s;hion
&s;hould have increa&s;ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when it is
wearing out both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; but
&s;o is mo&s;t certainly the fact; account for it
who will.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt, that the fa&s;hion
of hard drinking at every table has contri|buted
much to roughen our manners. Our
gentlemen of the la&s;t age were much more
polite than tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent; they had
their jovial clubs of an evening, but they
ro&s;e from dinner time enough to pay their
compliments to the ladies in the drawing-room.
The Edinburgh Mi&s;cellany, Allan
Ram&s;ay's Tea-table Mi&s;cellany, and even
Mr. Hamilton of Bangour's Poems, which
are of a much later date, &s;hew us, that there
was in Scotland a genteel mode of &s;ociety,
which &s;eems now to be quite given up.
Our ladies and gentlemen a&s;&s;embled at tea
in the afternoons, where they had the mo&s;t
agreeable opportunities of improving them|&s;elves
<PB N="13" REF="16">
in a genteel addre&s;s and gay conver|&s;ation.
Colonel <HI>Forre&s;ter,</HI> who wrote <HI>The
Polite Philo&s;opher,</HI> was formed in &s;uch &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Whereas now every drawing-room is like
a nunnery, and the ladies hardly &s;ee the gen|tlemen
but at &s;ome public place, where they
often appear when much intoxicated; a
mon&s;trous degree of indecency, peculiar to
Scotland. Surely being accu&s;tomed to &s;ee
men drunk, (a &s;ituation into which the A|thenians
forced their &s;laves, that their youth
might, by beholding its ugly effects, have
an abhorrence at the vice,) mu&s;t not a little
hurt the delicacy of our ladies. Although
the gentlemen &s;hould not be what is called
<HI>mortal,</HI> their being inflamed with liquor mu&s;t
make their conver&s;ation and behaviour &s;uch,
as ought to &s;hock our ladies; and, if they
are much accu&s;tomed to it, &s;ure I am the
enamel is off their minds, and blunted are
tho&s;e finer feelings of which an elegant wo|man
ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As another proof of our pre&s;ent coar&s;e|ne&s;s,
I cannot but ob&s;erve, that, amid&s;t all
our extravagance, we are &s;hamefully defici|ent
in dre&s;s, which is the lea&s;t hurtful mode
of expence, as it can do no harm either to
body or mind, while it encourages the la|bours
of the indu&s;trious, and affords a pretty
exerci&s;e for ta&s;te and fancy.</P>
<P>Negligence, or want of attention to oeco|nomy,
is the &s;econd general cau&s;e of bank|ruptcy.
<PB N="14" REF="17">
Sir <HI>Francis Osborne,</HI> who wrote a
great many years ago in <HI>England,</HI> has a pa&s;|&s;age

few variations, might be addre&s;&s;ed at this
day to numbers in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The &s;ub&s;tance

<P><Q REND="inline">I find the <HI>oeconomicks,</HI> though mo&s;t u&s;e|ful
to being, the lea&s;t e&s;teemed with our <HI>gal|lants,</HI>
looked upon by &s;ome as trivial, by o|thers
as di&s;honourable and unbecoming a
ma&s;culine employment; yet a total neglect
of them may be found in experience the ruin
of the greate&s;t families in <HI>England,</HI> as their
more exact pro&s;ecution keeps up men's
e&s;tates in <HI>Italy,</HI> where the inhabitants are ce|lebrated
as mo&s;t generally wi&s;e, and there|fore
not unfitly propo&s;ed in this for an uni|ver&s;al
pattern, but where they border too
near the confines of penury and ba&s;ene&s;s,
mo&s;t unbecoming the cu&s;tom and plenty of
<HI>England</HI>; and where in this particular, (till
the &s;word received a commi&s;&s;ion from GOD
to devour all things good and honourable
in the land,) our noblemen equalled the
princes, and our king exceeded in ho&s;pita|lity
all the monarchs in the known world;
and might yet have done more, had the true
elements of thrift been maintained in equal
proportion, by providing all things at the
be&s;t hand, and making u&s;e of times and &s;ea|&s;ons;
in which I confe&s;s, &s;o much as purely
<PB N="15" REF="18">
belongs to hou&s;ewifery ought, if not in di&s;|cretion,
yet in reverence to cu&s;tom, to be
left to women, provided they own abilities
competent for the employment, which is yet
&s;ometimes &s;o far contradicted by experience,
as the fir&s;t leak of a hu&s;band's fortune is
found to ri&s;e in the kitchen, and &s;uch rooms
as a man of quality cannot decently vi&s;it.
Nor is there a better way patent to obviate
this falling into a hectic through a dy&s;entery,
than by an equal balancing all weekly ac|counts;
never noted by wi&s;dom any more
blemi&s;h to honour, than to know how many
hor&s;es he keeps in the &s;table, a place that
cannot be denied to be made, by u&s;e rather
than rea&s;on, more becoming his pre&s;ence
than the pa&s;try or larder: nor is the keeping
of a regulated expence (magnified rather
than decried in the highe&s;t courts of wi&s;|dom,)
neglected &s;o much out of &s;corn as
defect; fathers, e&s;pecially rich ones, being
&s;o far to learn them&s;elves what is mo&s;t fit
their children &s;hould be taught, as they keep
them &s;o long in their Latin &s;chool, till the
time is lap&s;ed mo&s;t proper for reading, and
to make a perfect accountant, the mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary
part of the mathematics, and &s;o much
as cannot be in any commerce &s;pared: it re|maining
indubitable, that none, &s;o indu&s;tri|ous
as to call him&s;elf to a weekly, or at lea&s;t
an annual reckoning, did ever through his
own default &s;pend an e&s;tate; whereas the
<PB N="16" REF="19">
want of this fir&s;t rudiment of thrift hath,
within the compa&s;s of my experience,
brought divers to a bit of bread, and demo|li&s;hed
the hou&s;es of the mo&s;t ancient gentry
in <HI>England.</HI> Now, if any de&s;ire to under&s;tand
how our more illiterate fathers came to e&s;cape
this cur&s;e, an an&s;wer lies ready, That the
greate&s;t part of their revenues did con&s;i&s;t in
provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, paid punctually at a
day, and &s;o ea&s;ily accounted for and remem|bered.
And this abundance they enjoyed
kept them plea&s;ed, and in friend&s;hip with
their e&s;tates, wanting neither company nor
re&s;pect, through which they became le&s;s li|quori&s;h
after the glory and &s;mall delights of
<HI>London,</HI> and the court, towards which they
did &s;eldom look but upon con&s;traint, having
never ta&s;ted them in youth, as now they do,
the only time to contract an affection to any
place or thing: So as that we call <HI>the breed|ing
of our gentry</HI> is the main rea&s;on of their
undoing, the glorious a&s;pects the city affords
rendering the more &s;olid plea&s;ures of the
country contemptible and di&s;ta&s;teful. And
thus infatuated, from the hope of a redemp|tion
by an <HI>office</HI> or <HI>wife,</HI> they drop into an
ocean of debts, between the <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Cha|rybdis</HI>
of a <HI>London</HI> and country hou&s;e, which
for want of moderating their expence, (a
thing arithmetic is the readie&s;t, if not the
only means to reform,) it becomes no le&s;s
terrible to look upon in relation to <HI>&s;olitude</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="20">
and <HI>dilapidations,</HI> than un&s;afe to abide in for
fear of the <HI>Sheriff.</HI></Q></P>
<P>So far <HI>Sir Francis Osborne.</HI>&mdash;And, indeed,
every man of ob&s;ervation and reflection mu&s;t
&s;ub&s;cribe to the truth of what he has &s;aid.
As judicious divines have remarked, that
none who are con&s;tant in the duty of pray|er,
by which their lives are daily reviewed
by them, with at lea&s;t &s;ome degree of awe,
will be very wicked; &s;o none who are re|gular
in keeping accounts will be very ex|travagant.
But negligence is often produ|ced
by extravagance. People perceive their
expence to be &s;o great, that they are afraid
to examine into the &s;tate of their affairs,
which they know are in a ruinous condition;
but they have not courage to retrieve them,
and abandon them&s;elves to de&s;pair. Such is
the &s;ituation of &s;ome; but the greate&s;t num|ber
of tho&s;e whom I have in my view have
not even an apprehen&s;ion or &s;u&s;picion of
their danger; they repo&s;e in ignorant ne|gligence,
while debt, like corroding ru&s;t, is
&s;ilently and &s;urely devouring their &s;ub&s;tance:
While thus deluded with ea&s;y dreams, they
are un&s;olicitous with regard to their own
expence, and thoughtle&s;sly become bound
as &s;ecurity for others, another unhappy cir|cum&s;tance,
which is now &s;o common, that
to refu&s;e it will irritate, and you have no
thanks for granting it. And here again <HI>Sir
Francis Osborne</HI> comes in, who cautions his
<PB N="18" REF="21">
&s;on in a &s;trong and lively manner, "Such
as are betrayed by their ea&s;y nature, to be
ordinary &s;ecurity for their friends, leave &s;o
little to them&s;elves, as their liberty remains
ever after arbitrary at the will of others.
Experience having recorded many (whom
their fathers had left elbow-room enough)
that by &s;urety&s;hip have expired in a dun|geon.
But if you cannot avoid this laby|rinth,
enter no further than the thread of
your own &s;tock will reach; the ob&s;ervation
of which, will, at wor&s;t, enable you to bail
your&s;elf."</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of being precipitantly rich is
the third general cau&s;e of bankruptcy. The
old prudent maxims of frugality, by which
our fathers acquired wealth and kept it, or
by which they at lea&s;t left their fortunes in
no wor&s;e &s;ituation than they found them,
are exploded; and we mu&s;t all attain to
riches by means of project and adventure.
A few men of enterprize may be of u&s;e in a
country, but what mu&s;t become of that
country where all are men of enterprize?
The con&s;equence mu&s;t be, that labourers, me|chanicks,
traders, and farmers, by all &s;trug|gling
to get into a &s;ituation higher than that
to which they have any probable means of
attaining, mu&s;t, like the frog in the fable, bur&s;t
in the attempt. Our landed gentlemen again,
ob&s;erving the artificial and temporary ri&s;e
in the price of all provi&s;ions, demand exor|bitant
<PB N="19" REF="22">
rents, which di&s;tracted men in &s;ome
ca&s;es agree to pay; and in other ca&s;es, the
gentlemen think them&s;elves &s;ure of getting,
after keeping their grounds for &s;ometime in
their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and laying out large
&s;ums of money upon their improvement, not
con&s;idering that in a few years their tenants
break, and that the calculations of profits
which they have framed upon their improve|ments
turn out to be fallacious. They are of|fended
if you would hint &s;uch things to them
while they are living up to the full extent of
their imaginary rents. Let us &s;ee the re|&s;ult
of all this. Our news-papers are filled
with &s;ales of lands, and the rolls of the court
of &s;e&s;&s;ion crouded with adjudications and
<HI>Ce&s;&s;io Bonorums,</HI> in the cour&s;e of which it has
come out, that footmen, common &s;oldiers,
and in &s;hort the lowe&s;t of mankind, have
obtained credit for hundreds, nay, thou|&s;ands
of pounds.</P>
<P>This unhappy &s;ubject of credit brings be|fore
us tho&s;e numerous banks and banking
companies, that mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing circulation
of paper currency, and that amazing multi|tude
of ca&s;h accounts which are at this time
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to which many of the bank|ruptcies
mu&s;t be imputed. Such has been
the rage of making profits by banking, and
&s;uch the flattering expectations, that if any
failures did happen, tho&s;e who i&s;&s;ued notes
would either be &s;o fortunate as not to be the
<PB N="20" REF="23">
&s;ufferers, or would be indemnified by the
intere&s;t drawn for their mere paper, that
they have given ca&s;h-accounts to many peo|ple
who, they could not but be &s;en&s;ible, had
neither money nor effects equal to the ex|tent
of the &s;um; and &s;uch men becoming
mutual &s;ecurity for each other, could not
mend the matter, but only &s;erve to encou|rage
the delu&s;ion, by having the appearance
of &s;ome &s;trength without any reality.</P>
<P>In the view of what I have already &s;up|po&s;ed,
that at the en&s;uing terms, payments
mu&s;t and will be demanded all over <HI>Scotland,</HI>
with a degree of rigour which we have ne|ver
before experienced. I would &s;ay a few
words to three different cla&s;&s;es of readers;
tho&s;e who can immediately pay; tho&s;e who,
if let alone for a time, may be able to pay;
and tho&s;e who mu&s;t be con&s;cious that they
neither can at pre&s;ent, nor have a probabi|lity
of ever being able to pay.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who are able to pay, let them
con&s;ider that they are called upon, not only
by ju&s;tice, but by every motive of humani|ty,
not to plead any affected excu&s;e, or avail
them&s;elves of any eva&s;ive delays, but on the
contrary, to exert them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t
diligence and anxiety, to make punctual pay|ment,
becau&s;e their failing &s;o to do may be
the occa&s;ion of breaking the credit of many,
who, if they could get exact payment of
what is due to them, might &s;till be able to
&s;upport them&s;elves with decency, and be
<PB N="21" REF="24">
u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. They ought to
con&s;ider that delaying on this critical and
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, to pay back the money
which they have borrowed till their creditors
have &s;uffered, is like delaying in the time of
a famine to pay back bread, which they have
borrowed, till their neighbours are dead:
nor is it enough that the law is open to all;
for we well know, that, notwith&s;tanding the
pre&s;ent di&s;patch in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, the
forms which ju&s;tice has devi&s;ed to prevent
crude deci&s;ions being pa&s;&s;ed, and ha&s;ty advan|tages
being taken, afford an opportunity for
chicane to contrive, that we &s;hall feel what
<HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> ju&s;tly enumerates, as one of the
mo&s;t galling evils, "the law's delay;" and a
good deal more is expended on every law-&s;uit,
than what is repaid when co&s;ts are allowed.
Be&s;ides, they ought to recollect, that there is
no proportion between the injury done to
<HI>them</HI> by a law-&s;uit, and that which is done by
it to men of le&s;s confirmed credit than theirs.
The bla&s;ts, that hardly &s;hake the deep-root|ed
tree, will tear up one that is not &s;o advan|tageou&s;ly
&s;ituated.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e who cannot pay immediately,
but, if let alone for a time, may be able to
pay, of which I do believe there will be
found a con&s;iderable number; I would ad|vi&s;e
them, when pu&s;hed by any of their cre|ditors,
candidly and fairly to explain their
&s;ituation and their pro&s;pects. If they are
gentlemen of e&s;tates, who have laid out mo|ney
<PB N="22" REF="25">
judiciou&s;ly, let them &s;hew, that in a few
years they will be able to di&s;charge what
they owe, and be richer than at pre&s;ent.
Gentlemen who have e&s;tates are however the
lea&s;t to be pitied; for, if their improvements
be &s;olid, they may always command credit;
but tho&s;e who have laid out their borrowed
money in farming or in trade, in the expec|tation
of con&s;iderable profits, and of being
allowed to pay off their debt gradually as
their profits come in, mu&s;t be in a very un|happy
&s;ituation, if a &s;udden demand is made
upon them. Let them then be in condition
to lay their circum&s;tances before their credi|tors,
both with accuracy and openne&s;s, &s;o
as to obtain their confidence and &s;ympathy,
while they may at the &s;ame time demon&s;trate
to them, that it will be their own intere&s;t to
have patience, as har&s;h mea&s;ures would have
the effect to forfeit tho&s;e lea&s;es, and fru&s;trate
tho&s;e advantageous &s;chemes, which would in
time afford a fund for full payment, in&s;tead
of the &s;mall &s;hare which would now be
drawn. I would hope, that following the
rules, which have been now pointed out,
may be attended with very beneficial con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e who mu&s;t be con&s;cious, that
they neither can at pre&s;ent, nor have a pro|bability
of ever being able to pay. I would
earne&s;tly exhort them to brave it out no
longer&mdash;no longer to go on accumulating
<PB N="23" REF="26">
di&s;tre&s;s on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">hers, and guilt on them&s;elves;
they can never have a better opportunity
for &s;topping than the pre&s;ent time, when
they have &s;o many neighbours to keep them
in countenance. I would advi&s;e them too,
to &s;eize the opportunity for another rea&s;on,
which may &s;trike a knell to &s;ome of their
hearts; for next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, an act
may be pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t fraudulent, and even
prodigal bankrupts, fraught with &s;uch &s;eve|rity,
as I wi&s;h from my &s;oul had been pa&s;&s;ed
&s;everal years ago. All of them will yet meet
with the greater indulgence the &s;ooner they
di&s;cover them&s;elves, and I promi&s;e them
they will find much more ea&s;e in their own
minds than in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, when they
are mi&s;erably a&s;&s;uming a fal&s;e appearance,
and hourly in terror of detection; while
every man whom they do not know they
&s;u&s;pect to be a me&s;&s;enger, and every pac|ket
that is delivered to them, they dread
contains a charge of horning.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude without expre&s;&s;ing my
hopes, that the late bankruptcies, however
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to individuals, de&s;erving and un|de&s;erving,
may be of general utility, if they
have the effect which we may &s;uppo&s;e they
will have on every rational and well-di&s;po|&s;ed
per&s;on, by re&s;toring ju&s;t notions of &s;ub|ordination,
frugality, and every other prin|ciple
by which the good order of &s;ociety is
maintained.</P>
