<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS now almo&s;t &s;even Years, &s;ince I happen'd to &s;ay one Morning to a certain Per&s;on di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Me|rit and Quality, that wherever the <HI>Italian Opera</HI> had come, it had driven out Poetry from that Nation, and not only Poetry, but the very Ta&s;t of Poetry, and of all the politer Arts; and that if the &s;ame Protection and Encouragement were continued to the <HI>O|pera,</HI> by which it was then &s;upported, the &s;ame
<PB REF="3">
Calamity would befal <HI>Great Britain</HI> which had happen'd to the Neighbouring Nations. As 'tis hard to find a Man more quick or more pe|netrating, than the Per&s;on to whom I &s;poke this; he immediately enter'd into that Senti|ment, and &s;oon after withdrew that Encou|ragement which he had given to the <HI>Italians.</HI> All that I foretold, and more than all hath happen'd. For &s;uch Things, &s;uch mon&s;trous Things have been lately writ, and &s;uch mon|&s;trous Judgments pa&s;s'd&punc; that what has been formerly &s;aid has been &s;ufficiently confirm'd, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible an Author can be &s;o very fooli&s;h, but he will find more &s;tupid Admi|rers.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t notorious In&s;tance of this Depravi|ty of Genius and Ta&s;t, is the E&s;&s;ay upon which the following Reflections are writ, and the Approbation which it has met with. I will not deny but that there are two or three Pa&s;&s;ages in it with which I am not di&s;pleas'd; but what are two or three Pa&s;&s;ages as to the whole?</P>
<Q><L>Fit Chaerilus ille</L>
<L>Quem bis ter&abque; bonum cum ri&s;u miror.</L></Q>
<P>The approving two or Three Pa&s;&s;ages among&s;t a multitude of bad ones, is by no means ad|vantageous to an Author. That little that is
<PB REF="4">
good in him does but &s;et off its contrary, and make it appear more extravagant. The Thoughts, Expre&s;&s;ions, and Numbers of this E&s;&s;ay are for the mo&s;t part but very indifferent, and in|different and execrable in Poetry are all one. But what is wor&s;e than all the rest, we find throughout the whole a deplorable want of that very Quality, which ought principally to appear in it, which is Judgment; and I have no Notion that where there is &s;o great a want of Judgment, there can be any Genius.</P>
<P>However, I had not publi&s;h'd the following Letter, but had &s;uffer'd his Readers to have bugg'd them&s;elves in the Approbation of a Pam|phlet &s;o very unde&s;erving, if I had not found things in it that have provok'd my Scorn, tho' not my Indignation. For I not only found my &s;elf attack'd without any manner of Provoca|tion on my &s;ide, and attack'd in my Per&s;on, in&s;tead of my Writings, by one who is whol|ly a Stranger to me, and at a time when all the World knew that I was per&s;ecuted by For|tune, I not only &s;aw that this was attempted in a clande&s;tine manner with the utmo&s;t Fal|&s;hood and Calumny, but found that all this was done by a little affected Hypocrite, who had nothing in his mouth at the &s;ame time but <HI>Truth, Candor, Friend&s;hip, good Nature, Hu|manity,</HI> and <HI>Magnanimity.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5">
'Tis for this Rea&s;on that I have publi&s;h'd the following Letter, in which if I have not treated the Author of the E&s;&s;ay with my u&s;ual Candor, he may thank him&s;elf and this good|natur'd Town. For having ob&s;erv'd with no little A&s;toni&s;hment, that Per&s;ons have been cen|&s;ur'd for ill Nature, who have attempted to di&s;play the Errors of Authors unde&s;ervedly &s;uc|ce&s;sful; tho' they have done this with all i|maginable Candor, and with the best and no|ble&s;t De&s;igns, which are the doing Ju&s;tice, the Di&s;covery of Truth, and the Improvement of Arts; while Writers of Lampoons and infamous Libels, who&s;e Anonymous Authors have lain lurking in the dark, &s;ometimes in Clubs, and &s;ometimes &s;olitary, like &s;o many common Rogues and Footpads, to ruin the Fortunes, and mur|der the Reputations of others; have been ca|re&s;s'd and bugg'd by their thoughtle&s;s Applau|ders, and treated as if they had been the mo&s;t vertuous and the be&s;t natur'd Men in the World; having ob&s;erv'd all this with no little a&s;toni&s;hment, I at la&s;t found out the rea|&s;on of it, which is, becau&s;e the Attempts of Libellers and Lampooners hurt only tho&s;e whom they attack, and delight the re&s;t of the Rea|ders; whereas they who expo&s;e by a ju&s;t Cri|tici&s;m the Ab&s;urdities of fooli&s;h fortunate Au|thors, attack all tho&s;e who commend and ad|mire tho&s;e Authors, and di&s;turb perhaps by o|pening their Eyes, no fewer than a thou&s;and
<PB REF="6">
Fops in the good Opinion which they have conceiv'd of them&s;elves. 'Tis for this Rea&s;on that I have endeavour'd to comply with this wi&s;e and good natur'd general Di&s;po&s;ition of Minds, and to make amends for the Ill-nature of my Critici&s;m, by the Allurements of my <HI>Satyr.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> at <HI>Sunning-Hill, Berks.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here &s;end you my An&s;wer to the two Que&s;tions which I lately received from you, which are whether the E&s;&s;ay upon Critici&s;m, which I lately &s;ent you is like to take in Town, and who is the Author of that anonymous Rhap&s;ody.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the fir&s;t Que&s;tion, my Opinion is that it will take very well. For the &s;ame thing is true of great Bo|dies of Men, which has been ob&s;erv'd of particular Per&s;ons; and that is, that when Genius thinks fit to depart from among them, good Ta&s;te never cares to be very long after it. When the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera drove Poetry from out this I&s;land, Critici&s;m thought it a very great Impertinence for her to &s;tay long behind. Be&s;ides that the elegant Tran&s;lations of the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera's, which Mr. <HI>Ton&s;on</HI> has publi&s;hed by the mo&s;t eminent Hands, have prepared People to like any thing that is of an equal Merit with tho&s;e Tran&s;lations, and with <HI>Tom Sternhold</HI>'s Ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>For the &s;econd <HI>Quaere,</HI> Mr.<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">  is of Opinion that this E&s;&s;ay was writ by &s;ome experienced judicious Per&s;on, who knows what Quantity of ba&s;e Alloy is at this Juncture requi&s;ite to deba&s;e the Coin of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and reduce it to the current Standard. But I am inclin'd to believe that it was writ by &s;ome young, or &s;ome raw Author, for the fol|lowing Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He di&s;covers in every Page a Sufficiency that is far beyond his little Ability; and hath ra&s;hly undertaken a Task which is infinitely above his Force; a Task that is only fit for the Author, with the ju&s;t Encomium of who&s;e E&s;&s;ay my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI> begins his own.</P>
<Q><PB N="2" REF="9">
<L>Happy that Author who&s;e correct E&s;&s;ay</L>
<L>Repairs &s;o well our old <HI>Horatian</HI> way.</L></Q>
<P>There is nothing more wrong, more low, or more incor|rect than this Rhap&s;ody upon Critici&s;m. The Author all along taxes others with Faults of which he is more guilty him&s;elf. He tells us in the very two fir&s;t Lines, that</P>
<Q><L>'Tis hard to &s;ay if greater want of Skill</L>
<L>Appear in writing, or in judging ill.</L></Q>
<P>Now whereas others have been at &s;ome Pains and Thought to &s;hew each of the&s;e wants of Skill &s;eparately and di&s;tinct|ly, his comprehen&s;ive Soul hath mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly contriv'd to &s;hew them both in a &s;upreme Degree together.</P>
<P>Secondly, While this little Author &s;truts and affects the Dictatorian Air, he plainly &s;hews that at the &s;ame time he is under the Rod; and that while he pretends to give Laws to others, he is him&s;elf a pedantick Slave to Authority and Opinion, of which I &s;hall give &s;ome In&s;tances.</P>
<P>In the beginning of his E&s;&s;ay he lays down this Maxim:</P>
<Q><L>Let &s;uch teach others who them&s;elves excel;</L>
<L>And cen&s;ure others who have written well.</L></Q>
<P>Where he would in&s;inuate, that they alone are fit to be Cri|ticks who have &s;hewn them&s;elves great Poets. And he brings in <HI>Pliny</HI> to confirm by his Authority the Truth of a Precept, which is denied by matter of Fact, and by the Experience of above Two thou&s;and Years.</P>
<Q><L>De Pictore, Sculptore, Fictore ni&s;i Artifex judicare non pote&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved by Writers of Politicks, That they who have &s;ucceeded be&s;t in the&s;e kind of Writings, have never been either Governours of Provinces, or Mini&s;ters of State, as <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in <HI>Greece, Machiavel</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and in this I&s;land <HI>Harrington.</HI> I will not &s;ay that this may be applied to Criticks. There are and have been very good ones who have been great Poets, as <HI>Horace</HI> in <HI>Italy, Boileau</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and in <HI>Great Britain</HI> my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common,</HI> and a living noble Author. Nay I am fully convinc'd, that there never was an admirable Poet, but he was a great Critick. For what can be more ab&s;urd than to imagine, that any Man can excel in any Art, or Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Profe&s;&s;ion, who
<PB N="3" REF="10">
does not under&s;tand that Profe&s;&s;ion, Art, or Bu&s;ine&s;s. Now he who under&s;tands the Art of Poetry is a Critick in Poetry. But this is undeniable at the &s;ame time, that there have been Criticks, who have been approv'd of by all the World, who never meddled with Poetry. Was <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> him&s;elf, the very Father of <HI>Criticks,</HI> a Poet? Why yes, 'tis pretended that there is a Fragment of an Ode, which was writ by him, remaining in <HI>Athenaeus.</HI> But is that &s;uf|ficient to denominate him a Poet? Did he ever write either Tragedy or Epick Poem? And yet how freely did he cen|&s;ure both Tragick and Epick Poets? <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;aeus,</HI> and <HI>Diony&s;ius Longinus</HI> among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Quintilian</HI> a|mong the <HI>Romans</HI> were free Cen&s;urers, yet no Poets. And &s;o are <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> and <HI>Dacier</HI> at pre&s;ent among the <HI>French.</HI> And what is &s;till more remarkable, is, that this young Author forgets him&s;elf to that degree, as to commend <HI>Longinus</HI> and <HI>Quintilian</HI> for accompli&s;h'd Criticks contrary to his own Precept.</P>
<P>Another In&s;tance which I &s;hall give of his being a Slave to Authority and Opinion, is the &s;ervile Deference which he pays to the Ancients.</P>
<Q><BIBL>P. 13.</BIBL> <L>Still Green with Bays each ancient Altar &s;tands </L>
<L>Above the reach of &s;acrilegious Hands,</L>
<L>Secure from Flames, from Envy's fiercer Rage,</L>
<L>De&s;tructive War, and all devouring Age.</L>
<L>See from each Clime the Learn'd their Incen&s;e bring,</L>
<L>Hear in all Tongues triumphant Poeans ring!</L>
<L>In Prai&s;e &s;o ju&s;t let ev'ry Voice be join'd,</L>
<L>And fill the general Chorus of Mankind.</L></Q>
<P>Which is ju&s;t the oppo&s;ite Extravagance and Extreme to that of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Perrault.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>French</HI>-man with an in&s;olent Stupidity contemn'd and bla&s;phem'd, even tho&s;e Hero's of Antiquity, who&s;e Wri|tings are admirable and Divine: This E&s;&s;ayer deifies Au|thors, who&s;e Writings are but tolerable and indifferent. <HI>Boileau,</HI> as a rea&s;onable Man, took the Path that lay in the middle of the two Extremes, as we &s;hall &s;ee by what follows.</P>
<Q>For what remains, &s;ays he, I would not have any one think, that in this number of ancient Writers approv'd of by all Ages, 'tis my Intention to comprehend &s;ome Au|thors,
<PB N="4" REF="11">
who indeed are ancient, but who have only acquir'd a moderate E&s;teem, as <HI>Lycophron, Nonnus, Silius Italicus,</HI> and the Author of the Tragedies which are attributed to <HI>Seneca,</HI> to whom in my mind we may not only boldly com|pare, but ju&s;tly prefer &s;everal of the modern Writers. I only admit into that exalted Rank that &s;mall number of admirable Writers, who&s;e Name alone is their Panegyrick, as <HI>Homer, Plato, Cicero, Virgil, &amp;c.</HI> And I do not regulate the E&s;teem which I have for them, by that length of Time which their Works have la&s;ted, but by the number of Years which they have been admir'd; of which 'tis convenient to adverti&s;e a great many People, who otherwi&s;e perhaps might indi&s;creetly believe, what Mon&s;ieur <HI>Perrault</HI> has a mind to in&s;inuate, that we commend the Ancients for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they are Ancients; and blame the Moderns for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they are Moderns; which is utterly fal&s;e; &s;ince there are &s;everal among the Ancients whom we do not admire, and &s;everal among the Moderns whom all the World extols. The An|tiquity of a Writer is no certain proof of his Merit; but the ancient and con&s;tant Admiration which all the World has had for his Writings, is a certain and infallible proof that we ought to admire them. <HI>Boileau</HI> Reflect. the 7^t^h on <HI>Longinus.</HI></Q>
<P>Thus hath <HI>Boileau</HI> determin'd this matter like a dextrous Di&s;tingui&s;her, and a mo&s;t rightful Judge. If I may be al|low'd to &s;peak my Sentiments after &s;o great a Ma&s;ter, I mu&s;t freely declare my Opinion, that of all the Poets a|mong the <HI>Graecians,</HI> I only admire <HI>Homer, Sophocles, Pindar,</HI> and <HI>Euripides,</HI> tho' I am very much pleas'd with &s;ome of the re&s;t; and of all the Poets among the <HI>Romans,</HI> I admire on|ly <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> and &s;ome parts of <HI>Lucretius</HI>; tho' I am very much pleas'd with <HI>Catullus, Tibullus, Terence,</HI> and others. For as for <HI>Lycophron, Nonnus, Apollonius Rhodius, Valerius Flaccus, Silius Italicus, Statius,</HI> I prefer the <HI>Para|di&s;e lost</HI> of <HI>Milton</HI> before them all together: Nay I will go yet farther, and declare, that tho' I mu&s;t freely own, that <HI>Virgil</HI> has infinitely the Advantage of <HI>Milton,</HI> in the wonderful Contrivance of his Poem, in the Harmony of his Ver&s;ification, and in the con&s;tant Tenor of his Maje&s;ty, and his Elevation; yet that <HI>Milton</HI> in &s;ome particular parts of his Poem has the Advantage of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and of Mankind.
<PB N="5" REF="12">
And tho' I can by no means believe <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> to be of equal Merit with <HI>Sophocles</HI> or <HI>Euripides,</HI> for which I &s;hall give my Rea&s;ons in another place; yet this I can &s;ay for the Honour of my Countryman, and of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that there are &s;everal &s;ingle Scenes in <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> which I prefer to all the Tragedies put together of which <HI>Seneca</HI> is accounted the Author.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give one more In&s;tance, by which it will appear that while this Young&s;ter is pretending to give Laws, he behaves him&s;elf like one who is &s;till in awe of the Rod; that he admires the Ancients, becau&s;e his Ma&s;ter tells him that they mu&s;t be admir'd; and that if the Ancients were his Contemporaries, and produc'd the &s;ame Writings now which they did formerly, he would u&s;e them with the &s;ame In&s;olence with which he treats his Contemporaries. In the 8^t^h Page of this E&s;&s;ay, he gives a verbo&s;e and indige&s;ted Encomium of the fir&s;t <HI>Graecian</HI> Criticks, but forgets and contradicts him&s;elf before he comes to the bottom of that very Page. For, &s;ays he,</P>
<Q><L>The gen'rous Critick fann'd the Poet's Fire,</L>
<L>And taught the World with Rea&s;on to admire;</L>
<L>Then Critici&s;m, the Mu&s;es Handmaid, proud</L>
<L>To dre&s;s her Charms, and make her more belov'd:</L>
<L>But following Wits from that Intention &s;tray'd,</L>
<L>Who could not win the Mi&s;tre&s;s, woo'd the Maid,</L>
<L>Set up them&s;elves, and drove a &s;ep'rate Trade.</L></Q>
<P>Never was any thing more ob&s;cure and confus'd than the foregoing Rhimes; but if there is any meaning in them, it mu&s;t be that which follows.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t Poets and Criticks were all one; and the&s;e Po|ets made u&s;e of their Critici&s;m only to make their Poetry more charming, and more accompli&s;h'd. But the Wits who immediately follow'd after them, deviated from the De&s;ign of their Predece&s;&s;ors; and not being able to attain to Poetry, took up a Re&s;olution to drive a &s;eparate Trade, and to &s;et up only for Criticks. If this is not his meaning, I &s;hould be glad to hear in Pro&s;e, and in plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> what his meaning is; for Rhime has been always a wicked Abettor and Concealer of Non&s;en&s;e. But if this is his meaning, then I de&s;ire to make the&s;e two Remarks, Fir&s;t, that the anciente&s;t Criticks among the <HI>Graecians</HI> were not
<PB N="6" REF="13">
Poets, as we ob&s;erv'd before; and Secondly, that if <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;aeus,</HI> and others were now a|live, and their excellent Critici&s;ms were now fir&s;t to ap|pear, it would be objected to tho&s;e great Men, in order to di&s;qualify them for Criticks, that they were no Ver&s;ifyers. And it is plain from the 2^d Page that another Objection would be made to them: For when he comes there to &s;peak of the Moderns, he tells us,</P>
<Q><L>Some dryly plain, without Invention's Aid,</L>
<L>Write dull Receipts how Poems may be made.</L></Q>
<P>Now it being evident, that the Critici&s;ms of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and of <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;aeus</HI> are writ with a great deal of Simpli|city, 'tis manife&s;t that if tho&s;e two Criticks had writ but ye&s;terday, they would be accus'd to day of being drily plain, and of writing dull Receipts.</P>
<P>But a third infallible mark of a young Author, is, that he hath done in this E&s;&s;ay what School-boys do by their Exerci&s;es, he hath borrow'd both from Living and Dead, and particularly from the Authors of the two famous E&s;&s;ays upon Poetry and Tran&s;lated Ver&s;e; but &s;o borrow'd, that he &s;eems to have the very Rever&s;e of <HI>Midas</HI>'s noble Facul|ty. For as the cour&s;e&s;t and the dulle&s;t Metals, were upon the touch of that <HI>Lydian</HI> Monarch immediately chang'd into fine Gold; &s;o the fine&s;t Gold upon this Author's handling it, in a moment lo&s;es both its lu&s;tre and its weight, and is immediately turn'd to Lead.</P>
<P>A fourth thing that &s;hews him a young man, is the not knowing his own mind, and his frequent Contradictions of him&s;elf. His Title &s;eems to promi&s;e an E&s;&s;ay upon Criti|ci&s;m in general, which afterwards dwindles to an E&s;&s;ay upon Critici&s;m in Poetry. And after all, he is all along giving Rules, &s;uch as they are, for Writing rather than Judging. In the beginning of the 8^t^h Page the Rules are nothing but Nature.</P>
<Q><L>The&s;e Rules of old di&s;cover'd, not devis'd,</L>
<L>Are Nature &s;till, but Nature methodiz'd.</L></Q>
<P>But no &s;ooner is he come to the 10^t^h Page, but the Rules and Nature are two different things.</P>
<Q><PB N="7" REF="14">
<L>When fir&s;t great <HI>Maro,</HI> in his boundle&s;s mind.</L>
<L>A Work t'outla&s;t immortal <HI>Rome</HI> de&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>Perhaps he &s;eem'd above the Critick's Law,</L>
<L>And but from Nature's Fountains &s;corn'd to draw.</L></Q>
<P>But in the la&s;t Line of this very Paragraph they are the &s;ame things again.</P>
<Q><L>Learn hence for ancient Rules and just E&s;teem,</L>
<L>To copy Nature is to copy them.</L></Q>
<P>But to this he will an&s;wer, That he is guilty of no Con|tradiction, that he is only &s;hewing that <HI>Virgil</HI> was guilty of Error and Ignorance; who fir&s;t ab&s;urdly began to write his <HI>Aeneis,</HI> and afterwards &s;ate down to learn the Rules of Wri|ting; which when he began to write that Poem, he took to be things di&s;tinct from Nature; but that after he had wrote part of it, he fell to the reading of <HI>Homer,</HI> and that undeceiv'd him. That while he is talking of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Er|ror and Ignorance, he is making a Parade of his own in|comparable Wi&s;dom and Knowledge; and not contradict|ing him&s;elf, but <HI>Virgil,</HI> or rather making him appear in|con&s;i&s;tent with and contradicting him&s;elf: for that tho' <HI>Vir|gil</HI> took the Rules and Nature to be di&s;tinct from each other, for his own part he is wi&s;er, and knows better things. Now is not this a very mode&s;t and a very judicious Gentleman?</P>
<P>A fifth Sign of his being a young Author is his being almo&s;t perpetually in the wrong. And here in relation to the foregoing pa&s;&s;age, I might de&s;ire to ask him one or two civil Que&s;tions. Fir&s;t, who acquainted him with that noble Particularity of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Life, that he de&s;igned to write his <HI>Aeneis</HI> without Art? Had he it from ancient or modern Authors, or does he owe it to a noble Effort of his own &s;agacious Soul? If <HI>Virgil</HI> had &s;o little Know|ledge of the Rules of his own Art, and &s;o very little true Judgment within him, as to be capable of &s;uch an Extravagance, an Extravagance which, &s;ays this E&s;&s;ayer, nothing but the reading of <HI>Homer</HI> was able to correct, how comes he &s;o far to have &s;urpa&s;s'd his Ma&s;ter in the admirable Contrivance of his Poem.

<PB N="10" REF="17">
If he &s;ays to the Knowing, what is it that he tells them here? That they mu&s;t judge according to Na|ture, or write according to Nature. Now does he tell them any thing in this that they did not know before? Well, but he &s;ays, he is laying down the&s;e Rules for the Ignorant; why then I humbly conceive that he ought to have told them what he means by Nature, and what it is to write or to judge according to Nature. For by expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf at the rate that he does, he neither &s;ays any thing to the Learned which they did not know before, nor any thing to the Ignorant which they can po&s;&s;ibly un|der&s;tand. <HI>Horace</HI> proceeded in a very different Method from this, when he was to acquaint the <HI>Pi&s;o</HI>'s what was the principal Source of good Writing, he not only told them that it was moral Philo&s;ophy,</P>
<Q><L>Scribendi recte, &s;apere est &amp; principium &amp; Fons,</L></Q>
<P>But pointed to the very Books where they might find that moral Philo&s;ophy,</P>
<Q><L>Rem tibi Socraticae poterant o&s;tendere Chartae.</L></Q>
<P>So that in one we have a clear and per&s;picuous Precept, and in the other an ob&s;cure and unintelligible Jargon. But let us go on.</P>
<Q><L>That Art is best which mo&s;t re&s;embles her,</L>

<Q><L>True Wit is everla&s;ting like the Sun,</L></Q>
<P>But awkardly borrow'd, and utterly &s;poil'd in the remo|val. For what can Expre&s;&s;ion be properly &s;aid to &s;hine upon? True Wit, or Genius; for that the noble Author means, as is plain from &s;everal parts of his Poem, &s;hines thro' and di&s;covers it &s;elf by the Expre&s;&s;ion; but Expre&s;|&s;ion, at the very be&s;t, can but &s;hine with a borrow'd Light, like the Moon and the re&s;t of the Planets, whereas Genius &s;hines and flames with its own Cele&s;tial Fire.</P>
<P>His In&s;tructions, his A&s;&s;ertions, his Commendations, his Cen&s;ures, his Advice, wherever they are his own, are ei|ther fal&s;e or trivial, or both. Such is that in the beginning of the twelfth Page.</P>

Thus is this E&s;&s;ayer for a double Di&s;pen&s;ing Power in Kings and ancient Authors, and is for making the Mo|derns doubly Slaves, Slaves in their Actions, and Slaves in their Writings. But as we boldly deny that Kings have either Power to make Laws, or to di&s;pen&s;e with them after they are made; &s;o tho&s;e Laws of Writing were nei|ther made by the Ancients, nor can tho&s;e Ancients di&s;|pen&s;e with them. As they are the Laws of Nature, and not of Men, as he has him&s;elf hinted in the beginning of the 8^t^h Page.</P>
<Q><L>Tho&s;e Rules of old di&s;cover'd, not devis'd,</L>
<L>Are Nature &s;till, but Nature methodiz'd.</L></Q>
<P>They are eternal and irrevocable, and never to be di&s;|pens'd with but by Nature that made them; and the only Rule for that Di&s;pen&s;ation is this, that a le&s;s Law may be violated to avoid the infringing of a greater; and 'tis e|qually the Duty both of Ancients and Moderns, to break thro' a le&s;s important Rule, when without that Infringe|ment a greater mu&s;t be violated, or the great End of all the Rules neglected. The great End of all the Rules is to in&s;truct, and the &s;ubordinate End is to plea&s;e, by moving of Pa&s;&s;ion, and particularly that kind of Pa&s;&s;ion which ought chiefly to reign in that &s;ort of Poetry in which the Poet writes. Now 'tis a Rule in Poetry, that the notori|ous Events of Hi&s;tory are not to be fal&s;ifyed, nor the Pe|riods of Time tran&s;pos'd or confounded. And yet <HI>Virgil</HI> in the fourth of his <HI>Aeneis,</HI> broke thro' this Rule at once by a bold and a judicious Anachroni&s;m, in order to make his Poem more admirable, and the more to exalt the Glory of the <HI>Roman</HI> Name. Whatever the Ancients ju&s;tly did, the Moderns may ju&s;tly do. 'Tis ridiculous and pedan|tick to imagine, that the natural Powers of the Soul were &s;tronger or more excellent in the Ancients than they are in the Moderns. And as to Experience we have va&s;tly the Advantage of them. When we con&s;ider Experience, as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> ob&s;erves, we are properly the Ancients, who live in the elder Ages of the World, and have the Advantage of the Knowledge of Three thou&s;and Years over the fir&s;t Writers. Not but that at the &s;ame time that I a&s;&s;ert the Equality of Faculties in the Moderns,
<PB N="15" REF="22">
and the Advantage of their Experience, I freely acknow|ledge the actual Preheminence that &s;everal of the Ancients have over the Moderns; but I have &s;ufficiently &s;hewn in the <HI>Advancement of Modern Poetry,</HI> that that actual Pre|heminence proceeded from accidental Cau&s;es, and not from any Superiority of Faculties in tho&s;e ancient Au|thors.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the &s;ame Page 12. there is &s;omething a&s;&s;erted that is both fal&s;e and impudent; where &s;peaking of the Ancients, he tells us,</P>

<L>His Precepts teach but what his Works in&s;pire.</L>
<L>Our Criticks take a contrary Extreme,</L>

<P>Before he goes ten Lines farther, he forgets him&s;elf, and commends <HI>Longinus</HI> for the very contrary Quality for which he commended <HI>Horace,</HI> and for the very &s;ame thing for which he condemns his Contemporaries.</P>

<P>He commends <HI>Horace</HI> for judging cooly in Ver&s;e, and ex|tols <HI>Longinus</HI> for criticizing with Fire in Pro&s;e. What a mi&s;erable Slave is this Author to Opinion?

Now he who writes any thing with Sublimity, let it be Pro&s;e or Ver&s;e, let it be Critici&s;m or Poetry, writes &s;ometimes with Fury, as <HI>Lon|ginus</HI> hath &s;hewn both by his Doctrine and his Example in the fir&s;t Chapter of his Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>But pray who are the&s;e Moderns that judge with Fury, and write with Flegm?

<L>And &s;uch as <HI>Chaucer</HI> is &s;hall <HI>Dryden</HI> be.</L></Q>
<P>Now what does young Mr. <HI>Bays</HI> mean by <HI>our &s;econd Life,</HI> and by <HI>bare Three&s;core?</HI> If he &s;peaks of him&s;elf, and means three&s;core Days, he means too much in Rea&s;on: But if he &s;peaks of <HI>Chaucer, Spencer,</HI> and <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and means three&s;core Years, he means too little in Con&s;cience. 'Tis now a hundred Years &s;ince <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> began to write, more &s;ince <HI>Spencer</HI> flouri&s;hed, and above 300 Years &s;ince <HI>Chaucer</HI> died. And yet the Fame of none of the&s;e is extingui&s;h'd. The Rea&s;on that he gives for this is fal&s;e too.</P>
<Q><L>Our Sons their Fathers failing Language &s;ee,</L></Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> may &s;uffice to &s;hew the Fal&s;ity of this, 'Tis above three&s;core Years &s;ince that Gentleman began to write, and yet his Language is &s;till good and new. Thus we find that the A&s;&s;ertion is fal&s;e here, the Rea&s;on of it fal&s;e; and we &s;hall find anon that the Inference is fal&s;e too.</P>
<Q><L>And &s;uch as <HI>Chaucer</HI> is &s;hall <HI>Dryden</HI> be;</L></Q>
<P>That is, &s;hall grow ob&s;olete and neglected, and be either forgot, or be read but by a few.</P>
<P>Whether the Language of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> will ever be as ob&s;olete as is at pre&s;ent that of <HI>Chaucer,</HI> is what neither this Author nor any one el&s;e can tell. For ev'ry Lan|guage hath its particular period of Time to bring it to Perfection, I mean to all the Perfection of which that Language is capable. And they who are alive cannot po&s;&s;ibly tell whether that period hath happen'd or not: If that period has not yet happen'd; yet 'tis not the Ob&s;oletene&s;s of Language which makes a Poet fall from the Reputation which he once enjoy'd, provided the Language in which that Poet wrote was at the Time of his Writing come to be capable of Harmony. For <HI>Spen|cer</HI> is ob&s;olete, yet is &s;till renown'd. That which makes an Author fall from his former Reputation, is, &s;ays <HI>Boi|leau,</HI> in his &s;eventh Reflection upon <HI>Longinus,</HI> his not
<PB N="20" REF="27">
having attain'd to that Point of Solidity and Perfection, which are nece&s;&s;ary to give a never dying E&s;teem to his Works. For Example, &s;ays he, the Latin Tongue in which <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> wrote, was already very much alter'd in the Time of <HI>Quintilian</HI> and of <HI>Aulus Gellius</HI>; and yet <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> were more e&s;teem'd when tho&s;e Criticks wrote, than they were in their own Age, be|cau&s;e they had as it were by their Writings fix'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Language, having attain'd to that Point of Soli|dity and Perfection which I have mention'd above.</P>
<P>If we reflect upon that mi&s;erable Ta&s;t which reigns now among our Readers, and that want of Genius which is &s;o deplorable in our pre&s;ent Writers, and that Ta&s;t and Genius daily more and more decline, we may with|out being Prophets foretel, according to the foremen|tion'd Ob&s;ervation of the Solidity and Perfection of Po|ems, that the Language is not like to alter to the Di&s;|advantage of tho&s;e Poets, who&s;e Works are the only Remains of them here below. But be that as it will, yet this is certain, that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> had one Quality in his Language, which <HI>Chaucer</HI> had not, and which mu&s;t always remain. For having acquir'd &s;ome Ju&s;tne&s;s of Numbers, and &s;ome Truth of Harmony and of Ver&s;i|fication, to which <HI>Chaucer</HI> thro' the Rudene&s;s of the Language, or want of Ear, or want of Experience, or rather perhaps a mixture of all, could not po&s;&s;ibly at|tain, that Ju&s;tne&s;s of Numbers, and Truth of Harmony and of Ver&s;ification can never be de&s;troy'd by any altera|tion of Language; and therefore Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> whatever alteration happens to the Language, can never be like to <HI>Chaucer.</HI></P>
<P>Wherever this Gentleman talks of Wit, he is &s;ure to &s;ay &s;omething that is very fooli&s;h, as Page 29.</P>
<Q><L>What is this Wit that does our Cares employ,</L>
<L>The Owner's Wife that other Men enjoy?</L>
<L>The more his Trouble as the more admir'd,</L>
<L>Where wanted &s;corn'd, and envy'd where acquir'd.</L></Q>
<P>Here again I de&s;ire leave to ask two or three Que|&s;tions. Fir&s;t, how can Wit be &s;corn'd where it is not? Is not this a Figure frequently employ'd in <HI>Hibernian</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="28">
Land? The Per&s;on who wants this Wit may indeed be &s;corn'd; but &s;uch a Contempt declares the Honour that the Contemner has for Wit. But &s;econdly, what does he mean by acquir'd Wit? Does he mean Genius by the word Wit, or Conceit and Point? If he means Ge|nius, that is certainly never to be acquir'd; and the Per&s;on who &s;hould pretend to acquire it, would be al|ways &s;ecure from Envy. But if by Wit he means Con|ceit and Point, tho&s;e are things that ought never to be in Poetry, unle&s;s by chance &s;ometimes in the Epigram, or in Comedy, where it is proper to the Character and the Occa&s;ion; and ev'n in Comedy it ought always to give place to Humour, and ev'n to be lo&s;t and ab&s;orp'd in that, according to the Precept of the noble Author of the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Poetry.</HI></P>
<Q><L>That &s;illy thing Men call &s;heer Wit avoid,</L>
<L>With which our Age &s;o nau&s;eou&s;ly is cloy'd;</L>
<L>Humour is all, Wit &s;hould be only brought</L>
<L>To turn agreeably &s;ome proper Thought.</L></Q>
<P>In the beginning of the 33^d Page there is a Couplet of Advice, the fir&s;t line of which is very impertinent, and the &s;econd very wrong.</P>
<Q><L>Be &s;ilent always when you doubt your Sen&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>Now who are the Per&s;ons to whom he is giving Advice here? Why, to Poets or Criticks, or both; but the Per|&s;ons to whom he ought to be &s;peaking are Criticks, that is, People who pretend to in&s;truct others. But can any man of common Sen&s;e want to be told, that he ought not to pretend to in&s;truct others, as long as he doubts of the Truth of his own Precepts?</P>
<P>But what can be more wrong or more ab&s;urd than the latter Ver&s;e of the Couplet?</P>
<Q><L>Speak when you're &s;ure, yet &s;peak with Diffidence.</L></Q>
<P>Now I &s;hould think that when a man is &s;ure, 'tis his Duty to &s;peak with a mode&s;t A&s;&s;urance; &s;ince in do|ing otherwi&s;e he betrays the Truth, e&s;pecially when he
<PB N="22" REF="29">
&s;peaks to tho&s;e who are guided more by Imagination than they are by Judgment, which is the Ca&s;e of three parts of the World, and three parts of the other Part.</P>
<P>He is &s;o great a Lover of Fal&s;hood, that whenever he has a mind to calumniate his Contemporaries, he up|braids them with &s;ome Defect, which is ju&s;t contrary to &s;ome good Quality for which all their Friends and their Acquaintance commend them. As for Example, if a Man is remarkable for the extraordinary Deference which he pays to the Opinions and the Remon&s;trances of his Friends, him he Libels for his Impatience under Reproof. On the contrary, if he has a mind to extol the Ancients, he pa&s;&s;es by either thro' Envy or Igno|rance all the great Qualities which they have, and ex|tols them for &s;ome peculiar one, the very want of which is known to all the World to be their Infirmity and their Defect. Thus in the 37^t^h Page he takes occa&s;ion to commend <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> for what he wrote in Phy&s;icks, a great deal of which is &s;o ju&s;tly cen&s;ur'd and condemn'd ev'n by the &s;ame learned and judicious Men, who allow his <HI>Aethicks,</HI> his <HI>Politicks,</HI> his <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> and his <HI>Poe|tick,</HI> to be worthy of the greate&s;t Philo&s;opher. And here as the Commendation which he gives him is fal&s;e, the manner of giving it is &s;till more fal&s;e. For, &s;ays he,</P>
<Q><L>Not only Nature did his Laws obey,</L>
<L>But Fancy's boundle&s;s Empire own'd his Sway.</L></Q>
<P>The Expre&s;&s;ion in the fir&s;t Ver&s;e is not only ab&s;urd, but bla&s;phemous. The Laws of Nature are unalterable and indi&s;pen&s;able but by God him&s;elf; and the greate&s;t Excel|lence to which the wi&s;e&s;t Philo&s;opher can attain, is not to controul, but to obey Nature.</P>
<P>In the Libel upon King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, he has not only endeavour'd to brand the Memory of that Prince for &s;omething which is utterly fal&s;e, but for &s;omething which if it had been true had been an Ex|cellence in that Prince. For <HI>Wits,</HI> &s;ays he, in that Mo|narch's Reign had Pen&s;ions, when all the World knows that it was one of the Faults of that Reign that none
<PB N="23" REF="30">
of the politer Arts were then encourag'd. For of this we may be &s;ure, that whenever we have a Prince and Mini&s;ters, who truly under&s;tand either their own Inte|re&s;t, or that of the Publick, Arts and Learning will be then encourag'd; I mean not &s;peciou&s;ly and pretended|ly, but really and &s;incerely.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> pretended to encourage Arts by allowing Pen&s;ions to &s;ome few Profe&s;&s;ors of them, where|as at the &s;ame time he was and is doing a thing, which has a natural Tendency to the driving them out of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> For by kindling and pro&s;ecuting an unju&s;t War thro' &s;o many different Nations, he has gone a very great way towards the barbarizing the Chri&s;tian World; and the Arts would have been at a much greater height, than they are now, without any manner of Encouragement from him, if they had been &s;uffer'd to have enjoy'd the Quiet of an univer&s;al Peace. In the &s;ame manner &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality in <HI>Great Britain</HI> have been kind to &s;ome par|ticular Profe&s;&s;ors of Poetry; but at the very &s;ame time, by not only introducing the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera among us, but by continuing con&s;tant Encouragers of it to this very day, they are doing a thing which will drive the very Art it &s;elf out of the Kingdom, as it has been already driven out of every other Nation; and are depriving their Favourite Authors of more than ever they yet be|&s;tow'd upon them. Any great Mini&s;ter would now have a glorious Opportunity of being a true Encourager of Poe|try, and ev'ry other generous Art, by repre&s;enting ef|fectually to her Maje&s;ty the Mi&s;chief that the <HI>Italians</HI> do both to her Subjects, and to the Arts, and &s;o driving tho&s;e melodious Ballad-Singers out of the Na|tion.</P>
<P>But to return to the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond, from which I may &s;eem to have in &s;ome mea&s;ure digre&s;s'd; there was then indeed a favourable regard &s;hewn to Wit, but no real Encouragement. <HI>Butler</HI> was &s;tarv'd at the &s;ame time that the King had his Book in his Poc|ket. Another great Wit lay &s;even Years in Pri&s;on for an incon&s;iderable Debt, and <HI>Otway</HI> dar'd not to &s;hew his Head for fear of the &s;ame Fate. The&s;e are &s;ome of the Glories of that Reign according to this Author. For if it be a Vice in a Prince to encourage an Art, 'tis a Vertue
<PB N="24" REF="31">
to neglect it. What a wretched Creature is this Pretender to Critici&s;m and Poetry to keep &s;uch a pother about an Art, the Encouragement of which he imputes as Infamy to King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second?</P>
<P>Well! but he tells us that not only</P>
<Q><L>The Wits had Pen&s;ions, but young Lords had Wit.</L></Q>
<P>Here in the compa&s;s of one poor Line are two devili&s;h Bobs for the Court. But 'tis no ea&s;y matter to tell which way the latter &s;quinting Reflection looks. For if he pretends to reflect upon that Prince, for receiving Per&s;ons of Quality who had Wit into his Court, can any thing be more imper|tinent than twice in one Line to libel a Monarch for being favourable to that very thing, which he takes &s;o much pains in this very Book to recommend to the World? If he means that the young Lords of the Court who pretended to Wit had it not, can any thing be more arrogant than to fly in the Face of all Mankind, and to contradict almo&s;t the only thing in which all &s;orts of People agree, ev'n in this divided Age, <HI>Britons</HI> and Foreigners, Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts, Whigs and Tories, Churchmen and Di&s;&s;enters, and to pre|tend to reflect upon Per&s;ons who&s;e very Names are their Panegyricks? The young Lords who had Wit in the Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, are the&s;e: The young former Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the young Earl of <HI>Mulgrave</HI> now Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the young Lord <HI>Buckhur&s;t</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> and <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> and the young Marque&s;s of <HI>Halifax</HI>; the young Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> the young Lord <HI>Vaughan</HI> now Lord <HI>Carbury,</HI> and &s;everal others. If the looking favou|rably upon young Per&s;ons of Quality who had Wit, may be imputed as Scandal to the Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond, that Court was certainly the mo&s;t &s;candalous one in <HI>Europe.</HI> But if he &s;ays on the other &s;ide that 'tis di&s;ho|nourable to a Prince to be mi&s;taken in this Point, and to look with a favourable Eye on Pretenders in&s;tead of real Ma&s;ters; to that all the World with one accord wlll an|&s;wer that never Prince had a clearer Reputation in this Point.</P>
<P>Thus are his A&s;&s;ertions, and his Precepts frequently fal&s;e or trivial, or both, his Thoughts very often crude and abortive, his Expre&s;&s;ions ab&s;urd, his Numbers often har&s;h
<PB N="25" REF="32">
and unmu&s;ical, without Cadence and without Variety, his Rhimes trivial and common. He dictates perpetually, and pretends to give Law without any thing of the Simplicity or Maje&s;ty of a Legi&s;lator, and pronounces Sentence with|out any thing of the Plainne&s;s or Clearne&s;s, or Gravity of a Judge. In&s;tead of Simplicity we have little Conceit and Epigram, and Affectation. In&s;tead of Maje&s;ty we have &s;omething that is very mean, and in&s;tead of Gravity we have &s;omething that is very boyi&s;h. And in&s;tead of Per|&s;picuity and lucid Order, we have but too often Ob&s;curity and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But what mo&s;t &s;hews him a very young Author, is, that with all the&s;e Faults and this Weakne&s;s he has the In&s;olence of a Hero, and is a downright Bully of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> who is ev'ry moment thundr'ing out Fool, Sot, Fop, Coxcomb, Blockhead, and thinks to hide his want of Sen&s;e by his pretended Contempt of others, as a Hector does his want of Courage by his perpetual blu&s;tring and roaring; and is &s;agaciou&s;ly of Opinion, that he arrogates &s;o much Sen&s;e to him&s;elf as he imputes Folly to other People.</P>
<Q><L>Thus a wild <HI>Tartar</HI> when he &s;pies</L>
<L>A Man that's hand&s;ome, valiant, wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Thinks if he kills him to inherit</L>
<L>His Wit, his Beauty, and his Spirit,</L>
<L>As if ju&s;t &s;o much he enjoy'd</L>
<L>As in another he de&s;troy'd.</L></Q>
<P>By what he &s;ays Page the 25^t^h, and his returning to the Charge, Page 34, his particular Pique &s;eems to be at People of Quality, for whom he appears to have a very great Contempt, I mean for the Authors of that Rank; as if a Man were to a&s;&s;ert his Title to <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> by proving him&s;elf a Plebeian in <HI>Great Britain</HI>; or as if an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> So|vereign by making a Man honourable, made him dull. Good Gods, how ab&s;olute would our Princes be at that rate! when they would have the very Under&s;tandings of their Subjects at their di&s;po&s;al, and would need only to prefer the Di&s;obedient to cha&s;ti&s;e them.</P>
<P>I hope, I may without offence, gently put young Mr. <HI>Bays</HI> in mind, that the Subordination which is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Government of the World requires
<PB N="26" REF="33">
that Re&s;pect &s;hould be paid to Per&s;ons of Quality, ev'n where E&s;teem cannot be paid to them; but that in this ca&s;e they both may and ought to have our Re&s;pect and E&s;teem together. For I know very few People of Quality who have applied them&s;elves to Poetry, who have not &s;uc|ceeded; on the other &s;ide 'tis known to all the World that &s;ome of them have been admirable. For nothing is more certain than that &s;uppo&s;ing equal Talent and equal Appli|cation, a Man of Quality has great Advantages over the re&s;t of Men. But can any thing be more &s;tupidly impu|dent and impertinent, than that this little Gentleman &s;hould rail thus at the Writings of People of Quality in this very E&s;&s;ay, the one half of which he has borrow'd from two noble Authors, and appropriated it to him&s;elf, by the &s;ame Method by which a <HI>Jack-pudding</HI> engro&s;&s;es a Sack-po&s;&s;et, <HI>viz.</HI> by mingling &s;ome Bea&s;tline&s;s with it, which does not fail to render it nau&s;eous to tho&s;e who made it. This extraordinary Proceeding of borrowing and railing puts me in mind of a Pa&s;&s;age in Mr. <HI>Cowley.</HI></P>
<Q><L>'Tis now become the frugal Fa&s;hion</L>
<L>Rather to bide than pay the Obligation;</L>
<L>Nay Wrongs and Outrages we do,</L>
<L>Lest Men &s;hould think we Owe.</L></Q>
<P>But the Men of Quality, as they want not the Di&s;cern|ment, will have the Satisfaction to &s;ee, that as there is a great deal of Venom in this little Gentleman's Temper, Nature has very wi&s;ely corrected it with a great deal of Dulne&s;s.</P>
<Q><L>His rankest Libels lull a&s;leep his Foes,</L>
<L>As Vipers blood in Treacle makes us do&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>As there is no Creature in Nature &s;o venomous, there is nothing &s;o &s;tupid and &s;o impotent as a hunch-back'd Toad; and a Man mu&s;t be very quiet and very pa&s;&s;ive, and &s;tand &s;till to let him fa&s;ten his Teeth and his Claws, or be &s;ur|priz'd &s;leeping by him, before that Animal can have any power to hurt him.</P>
<P>Thus in order to find out his outward Per&s;on, have we taken a Survey of his inward Man, in his &s;everal noble Ta|lents
<PB N="27" REF="34">
and Vertues, his Poetry, his Critici&s;m, his Mode&s;ty, his Humility, his Gratitude, and his good Breeding. Let us now take a Survey of his Politicks, and his Religion, not by any means by way of Reflection; for Poetry and Critici&s;m are of no Party, and of no Religion, but only to find who he is.</P>
<P>I find then that in the compa&s;s of one Page, which is the thirty fir&s;t, he has Libell'd two Monarchs and two Na|tions. The two Monarchs are King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>William:</HI> The two Nations are the <HI>Dutch</HI> and our own. The <HI>Dutch</HI> we are told are a parcel of Sharpers, and we are downright Bubbles and Fools. King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond was too much a Libertine, and too much an Encou|rager of Wit for him; King <HI>William</HI> the Third was too much a <HI>Socinian.</HI> But tho' he has without Mercy con|demn'd the Reigns of the foremention'd Monarchs, he is graciou&s;ly pleas'd to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence that which comes between them. In the beginning of the 12^t^h Page, we find what that is which &s;o happily reconcil'd him to it, and that was the Di&s;pen&s;ing Pow'r, which was &s;et on foot in order to introduce and to e&s;tabli&s;h Popery, and to make it the National Religion. Now I humbly conceive that he who Libels our Confederates, mu&s;t be by Politicks a <HI>Jacobite</HI>; and he who Libels all the Prote&s;tant Kings that we have had in this I&s;land the&s;e three&s;core Years, and who ju&s;tifies the Di&s;pen&s;ing Pow'r &s;o long after we are free'd from it, a Pow'r which as was hinted above was &s;et on foot on purpo&s;e to introduce Popery: He who ju&s;tifies this when he lyes under the Tye of no Nece&s;&s;ity, nor ev'n Conveniency to approve of it, mu&s;t, I humbly conceive, derive his Religion from St. <HI>Omer</HI>'s, as he &s;eems to have done his Humanity and his Critici&s;m; and is, I &s;uppo&s;e, politickly &s;etting up for Poet-Laureat again&s;t the coming over of the Pretender, which by his In&s;olence he &s;eems to believe approaching, as People of his Capacity are gene|rally very &s;anguine.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee if we can find any thing in his Rhimes, which may direct us to his Coffee-hou&s;e, or to his Book&s;ellers. By his taking three Opportunities to commend Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s as p. 23, 27, 28, I fancy we may hear of him at <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Head, or at <HI>Will</HI>'s, for to revive old Quarrels which
<PB N="28" REF="35">
have been long out of doors, and to renew the memo|ry of Poetical Wars wag'd formerly between Sir <HI>R. B.</HI> Mr. <HI>L. M.</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> can be agreeable to none but a very few of the Frequenters of tho&s;e Places. This is to run counter to his own Direction; for he tells us Page 27. that formerly</P>
<Q><L>Pride, Malice, Folly against <HI>Dryden</HI> ro&s;e</L>
<L>In various &s;hapes of Par&s;ons, Criticks, Beaus.</L></Q>
<P>Upon which, Page 28, he gives this grave Advice,</P>
<Q><L>Be thou the first true Merit to befriend,</L>
<L>His Prai&s;e is lost who &s;tays till all commend.</L></Q>
<P>The appearing in Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s behalf now is too late. 'Tis like offering a Man's &s;elf for a Second, after the Princi|pal has been whipp'd through the Lungs. Now Mr. <HI>Dry|den</HI> is dead, he commends him with the re&s;t of the World. But if this little Gentleman had been his Contemporary thirty Years ago, why then I can tell a very damn'd &s;hape that Pride and Malice, and Folly would have appear'd in again&s;t Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI></P>
<P>For his Acquaintance he names Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h.</HI> I had the good Fortune to know Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> very well; who was a learned, candid, judicious Gentleman. But he had by no means the Qualification which this Author reckons ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to a Critick; it being certain that Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> was like this E&s;&s;ayer a very indifferent Poet; but he was a Man of a very good Under&s;tanding, in &s;pight of his being a Beau. He lov'd to be well dre&s;s'd, as <HI>Do|rimant</HI> &s;ays, and thought it no Di&s;paragement to his Un|der&s;tanding; and I remember a little young Gentleman, with all the Qualifications which we have found to be in this Author, whom Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> us'd &s;ometimes to take in|to his Company as a double Foil to his Per&s;on, and his Ca|pacity. It has been ob&s;erv'd that of late Years a certain Spectre exactly in the &s;hape of that little Gentleman, has haunted a certain ancient Wit, and has been by the Peo|ple of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> &s;tyl'd his evil Genius. For it hath been extremely remarkable, that while that Spectre hath haunted that ancient Wit, he has never been able to write
<PB N="29" REF="36">
or talk like him&s;elf: Which has by no means happen'd by any Decay of his natural Parts, but by the wonderful Pow'r of Magick. For as &s;oon as the dumb Conjurer has been employ'd to lay the Spectre for three or four months, either in the mid&s;t of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> or the mid|dle of <HI>Wind&s;or-Fore&s;t,</HI> the old Gentleman has &s;trait been his own Man as perfectly as ever he was in his Life.</P>
<P>And now if you have a mind to enquire between <HI>Sun|ning-Hill</HI> and <HI>Ockingham,</HI> for a young, &s;quab, &s;hort Gentle|man, with the forementioned Qualifications, an eternal Writer of Amorous Pa&s;toral Madrigals, and the very Bow of the God of Love, you will be &s;oon directed to him. And pray as &s;oon as you have taken a Survey of him, tell me whether he is a proper Author to make per|&s;onal Reflections on others; and tell him if he does not like my Per&s;on, 'tis becau&s;e he is an ungrateful Creature, &s;ince his Con&s;cience tells him, that I have been always in|finitely delighted with his: So delighted, that I have lately drawn a very graphical Picture of it; but I believe I &s;hall keep the <HI>Dutch</HI> Piece from ever &s;eeing the Light, as a certain old Gentleman in <HI>Wind&s;or-Forest</HI> would have done by the Original, if he dur&s;t have been half as im|partial to his own Draught as I have been to mine. This little Author may extol the Ancients as much and as long as he plea&s;es, but he has rea&s;on to thank the good Gods that he was born a Modern. For had he been born of <HI>Graecian</HI> Parents, and his Father by con&s;equence had by Law had the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al of him, his Life had been no longer than that of one of his Poems, the Life of half a day. In&s;tead of &s;etting his Picture to &s;how, I have taken a keener Revenge, and expos'd his Intellectuals, as duly con&s;idering that let the Per&s;on of a Gentleman of his Parts be never &s;o contemptible, his inward Man is ten times more ridiculous; it being impo&s;&s;ible that his outward Form, tho' it &s;hould be that of downright Monkey, &s;hould differ &s;o much from human Shape, as his immaterial unthinking part does from human Under&s;tanding. How agreeable it is to be in a Libel with &s;o much good Compa|ny as I have been, with two great Monarchs, two mighty Nations, and e&s;pecially the People of Quality of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and this Libel compos'd by a little Gentleman, who has writ a Panegyrick upon him&s;elf! Which Panegy|rick
<PB N="30" REF="37">
if it was not writ with Judgment, yet was it pub|li&s;h'd with Di&s;cretion, for it was publi&s;h'd in Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>'s Name; &s;o that by this wi&s;e Proceeding he had the Benefit of the Encomium, and Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> had the Scandal of the Poetry: which it brought upon him to &s;uch a degree, that 'tis ten to one if ever he recovers the Reputation of a good Ver&s;ifyer. And thus for the pre&s;ent I take my leave of you and of this little Critick and his Book; a Book throughout which Folly and Ignorance, tho&s;e Brethren &s;o lame and &s;o impotent, do ridiculou&s;ly at one and the &s;ame time look ve|ry big and very dull, and &s;trut, and hobble cheek by jowl with their Arms on Kimbo, being led and &s;upported, and Bully-back'd by that blind Hector Impudence.

<P>1. <HI>First follow Nature,</HI> p. 7.</P>
<P><HI>Horace</HI> has giv'n a Precept, which may be quoted by undi|&s;tingui&s;hing People to keep this in countenance.</P>
<Q><L>Re&s;picere exemplar vitae, morum&abque; jubebo</L>
<L>Doctum imitatorem &amp; veras hinc Ducere voces.</L></Q>
<P>For he bids the Per&s;on to whom this is directed con&s;ult Na|ture; but then he does three things, which va&s;tly di&s;tin|gui&s;h him from the Writer of the E&s;&s;ay: For fir&s;t he makes it very plain what &s;ort of Per&s;on this is to whom he directs him&s;elf, and that is <HI>Doctus Imitator,</HI> one who is both Poet and Critick, Dramatick Poet, and Dramatick Critick; one who writes Plays, and under&s;tands the Rules, and knows the Secrets of his Art; notwith&s;tanding which, he may be ignorant of that important one, which <HI>Horace</HI> is about to di&s;cover to him; or in ca&s;e he does already know it, he may want to be put in mind of it, becau&s;e his Intere&s;t, as we &s;hall find anon, is a &s;trong Temptation to deviate from it. But &s;econdly <HI>Horace</HI> tells us very intelligibly what he
<PB N="31" REF="38">
means by Nature here, and that is, human Life, and the manners of Men. Thirdly, he makes it as clear as the Sun, what it is to follow Nature in giving a draught of human Life, and of the manners of Men, and that is not to draw after particular Men, who are but Copies and imperfect Co|pies of the great univer&s;al Pattern; but to con&s;ult that innate Original, and that univer&s;al Idea, which the Crea|tor has fix'd in the minds of ev'ry rea&s;onable Creature, and &s;o to make a true and a ju&s;t Draught. For as ev'ry Copy deviates from the Original both in Life and Grace, and Re&s;emblance, a Poet who de&s;igns to give a true Draught of human Life and Manners, mu&s;t con&s;ult the univer&s;al Idea, and not particular Per&s;ons. For Example, when a Poet would draw the Character of a covetous or a revengeful per&s;on, he is not to draw after <HI>Lucius</HI> or <HI>Caius</HI>; but to con|&s;ult the univer&s;al pattern within him, and there to behold what Revenge or Covetou&s;ne&s;s would do in &s;uch and &s;uch Natures, upon &s;uch and &s;uch Occa&s;ions. For if he draws after <HI>Lucius</HI> or <HI>Caius,</HI> the workings of Revenge and Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s in the&s;e two, being but Copies and imperfect Co|pies of their workings according to the univer&s;al <HI>Idea,</HI> and the Poet degenerating in his Draught ev'n from tho&s;e faint and imperfect Copies, whenever a ju&s;t and di&s;cerning Judge comes to compare that Draught with the Original within him, he immediately finds that that Draught falls extreme|ly &s;hort of the Truth of Nature, and immediately di&s;ap|proves of it, as a &s;econd, ungraceful, faint, unre&s;embling Copy. Agreeable to this is that pa&s;&s;age of the mo&s;t di&s;cer|ning Author of the E&s;&s;ay upon Poetry.</P>
<Q><L>If once the Ju&s;tne&s;s of each part is lost,</L>
<L>Well may we laugh, but at the Poet's cost.</L></Q>
<P>Thus <HI>Horace</HI> here &s;peaks to the Knowing, yet tells them &s;omething that &s;everal of them want to be taught, and &s;e|veral to be put in mind of. For it has been a Complaint of Two thou&s;and Years &s;tanding, that Poets have been us'd to violate their Subjects, and to force their Characters out of complai&s;ance to their Actors, that is, to their Intere&s;t. Mo&s;t of the Writers for the Stage in my time, have not only adapted their Characters to their Actors, but tho&s;e Actors have as it were &s;ate for them. For which rea&s;on the
<PB N="32" REF="39" MS="y">
Lu&s;tre of the mo&s;t &s;hining of their Characters mu&s;t decay with the Actors, while tho&s;e of <HI>Sophocles, Euripides, Terence,</HI> and <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> will eternally remain.</P>

<P>2. <HI>Still green with</HI> Bays <HI>each ancient Altar &s;tands,</HI> p. 13.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Bays</HI> &s;hould &s;ay here that by each ancient Altar he does not mean ev'ry ancient Poet, but only tho&s;e few who have been admir'd by all &s;ucceeding Ages; to this I an&s;wer, that be&s;ides that the Expre&s;&s;ion will by no means bear this Sen&s;e, it appears plainly from the two fir&s;t lines of p. 12. that he &s;peaks of the Ancients in general.</P>
<Q><L>And tho' the Ancients thus their Rules invade,</L>
<L>As Kings di&s;pen&s;e with Laws them&s;elves have made.</L>
<L>Moderns beware. <BIBL>p. 12.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>I think nothing can be more plain, than that here he pre|fers all the Ancients before all the Moderns, treating the former as &s;o many Monarchs and Legi&s;lators at the &s;ame time in the Regions of Sen&s;e, and the latter as &s;o many Slaves. Be&s;ides that the&s;e Ver&s;es manife&s;tly relate rather to the indifferent Poets among the Ancients, than to tho&s;e who are admirable; for the indifferent ones have mo&s;t and oftne&s;t invaded the Rules, Indeed they have &s;carce ever ob&s;erv'd them; as <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> have &s;carce ever tran&s;|gre&s;s'd them.</P>
