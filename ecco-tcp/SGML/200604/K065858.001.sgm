<PB REF="3">
<P>THE melancholy duty of examining the Papers of my
decea&s;ed Friend devolved upon me at a time when I
was depre&s;&s;ed by &s;evere afflictions.</P>
<P>In that &s;tate of mind, I he&s;itated to undertake the
ta&s;k of &s;electing and preparing his Manu&s;cripts for the
pre&s;s. The warmth of my early and long attachment to
Mr. Gibbon made me con&s;cious of a partiality, which
it was not proper to indulge, e&s;pecially in revi&s;ing
many of his juvenile and unfini&s;hed compo&s;itions. I
had to guard, not only again&s;t a &s;entiment like my
own, which I found exten&s;ively diffu&s;ed, but al&s;o again&s;t
the eagerne&s;s occa&s;ioned by a very general curio&s;ity to &s;ee
in print every literary relick, however imperfect, of &s;o
di&s;tingui&s;hed a writer.</P>
<P>Being aware how di&s;gracefully Authors of Eminence
have been often treated, by an indi&s;creet po&s;thumous pub|lication
of fragments and carele&s;s effu&s;ions; when I had
&s;elected tho&s;e Papers which to my&s;elf appeared the fitte&s;t
for the public eye, I con&s;ulted &s;ome of our common
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
friends, whom I knew to be equally anxious with my&s;elf
for Mr. Gibbon's fame, and fully competent, from their
judgment, to protect it.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch a &s;anction it is, that, no longer &s;u&s;pecting
my&s;elf to view through too favourable a medium the
compo&s;itions of my Friend, I now venture to publi&s;h
them: and it may here be proper to give &s;ome informa|tion
to the Reader, re&s;pecting the Contents of the&s;e
Volumes.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important part con&s;i&s;ts of Memoirs of Mr.
Gibbon's Life and Writings, a work which he &s;eems
to have projected with peculiar &s;olicitude and atten|tion,
and of which he left Six different &s;ketches, all
in his own hand-writing. One of the&s;e &s;ketches, the
mo&s;t diffu&s;e and circum&s;tantial, &s;o far as it proceeds,
ends at the time when he quitted Oxford. Another
at the year 1764, when he travelled to Italy. A
third, at his father's death, in 1770. A fourth, which
he continued to a &s;hort time after his return to Lau|&s;anne
in 1788, appears in the form of Annals, much
le&s;s detailed than the others. The two remaining &s;ketches
are &s;till more imperfect. It is difficult to di&s;cover the
order in which the&s;e &s;everal Pieces were written, but
there is rea&s;on to believe that the mo&s;t copious was the
la&s;t. From all the&s;e the following Memoirs have been
carefully &s;elected, and put together.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5">
My he&s;itation in giving the&s;e Memoirs to the world
aro&s;e, principally, from the circum&s;tance of Mr.
Gibbon's appearing, in &s;ome re&s;pect, not to have been
&s;atisfied with them, as he had &s;o frequently varied
their form: yet, notwith&s;tanding this diffidence, the
compo&s;itions, though unfini&s;hed, are &s;o excellent, that
they may ju&s;tly entitle my Friend to appear as his
own biographer, rather than to have that ta&s;k under|taken
by any other per&s;on le&s;s qualified for it.</P>
<P>This opinion has rendered me anxious to publi&s;h the
pre&s;ent Memoirs, without any unnece&s;&s;ary delay; for I
am per&s;uaded, that the Author of them cannot be made
to appear in a truer light than he does in the following
pages. In them, and in his different Letters, which
I have added, will be found a complete picture of
his talents, his di&s;po&s;ition, his &s;tudies, and his attain|ments.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;light variations of character, which naturally
aro&s;e in the progre&s;s of his Life, will be unfolded in a
&s;eries of Letters, &s;elected from a Corre&s;pondence between
him and my&s;elf, which continued full thirty years, and
ended with his death.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, that all the &s;ketches of the Me|moirs,
except that compo&s;ed in the form of Annals, and
which &s;eems rather de&s;igned as heads for a future Work,
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
cea&s;e about twenty years before Mr. Gibbon's death;
and con&s;equently, that we have the lea&s;t detailed ac|count
of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of his Life. His Cor|re&s;pondence
during that period will, in great mea&s;ure,
&s;upply the deficiency. It will be &s;eparated from the
Memoirs and placed in an Appendix, that tho&s;e
who are not di&s;po&s;ed to be plea&s;ed with the repeti|tions,
familiarities, and trivial circum&s;tances of epi&s;to|lary
writing, may not be embarra&s;&s;ed by it. By many,
the Letters will be found a very intere&s;ting part
of the pre&s;ent Publication. They will prove, how
plea&s;ant, friendly, and amiable Mr. Gibbon was in
private life; and if, in publi&s;hing Letters &s;o flatter|ing
to my&s;elf, I incur the imputation of vanity, I
&s;hall meet the charge with a frank confe&s;&s;ion, that
I am indeed highly vain of having enjoyed, for &s;o
many years, the e&s;teem, the confidence, and the affec|tion
of a man, who&s;e &s;ocial qualities endeared him to
the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;ociety, and who&s;e talents, great
as they were, mu&s;t be acknowledged to have been fully
equalled by the &s;incerity of his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Whatever cen&s;ure may be pointed again&s;t the
Editor, the Public will &s;et a due value on the Let|ters
for their intrin&s;ic merit. I mu&s;t, indeed, be
blinded, either by vanity or affection, if they do
not di&s;play the heart and mind of their Author, in
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
&s;uch a manner as ju&s;tly to increa&s;e the number of his
admirers.</P>
<P>I have not been &s;olicitous to garble or expunge pa&s;&s;ages
which, to &s;ome, may appear trifling. Such pa&s;&s;ages will
often, in the opinion of the ob&s;erving Reader, mark the
character of the Writer, and the omi&s;&s;ion of them would
materially take from the ea&s;e and familiarity of authentic
letters.</P>
<P>Few men, I believe, have ever &s;o fully unveiled their
own character, by a minute narrative of their &s;entiments
and pur&s;uits, as Mr. Gibbon will here be found to have
done; not with &s;tudy and labour&mdash;not with an affected
frankne&s;s&mdash;but with a genuine confe&s;&s;ion of his little
foibles and peculiarities, and a good-humoured and na|tural
di&s;play of his own conduct and opinions.</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon began a Journal, a work di&s;tinct from
the &s;ketches already mentioned, in the early part of his
Life, with the following declaration:</P>
<P><Q>I propo&s;e from this day, Augu&s;t 24th 1761, to
keep an exact Journal of my actions and &s;tudies, both
to a&s;&s;i&s;t my memory, and to accu&s;tom me to &s;et a due
value on my time. I &s;hall begin by &s;etting down
&s;ome few events of my pa&s;t life, the dates of which
I can remember.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="8">
This indu&s;trious project he pur&s;ued occa&s;ionally in
French, under various titles, and with the minutene&s;s,
fidelity, and liberality of a mind re&s;olved to watch over
and improve it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Journal is continued under different titles, and
is &s;ometimes very conci&s;e, and &s;ometimes &s;ingularly de|tailed.
One part of it is entitled "My Journal," ano|ther
"Ephemerides, or Journal of my Actions, Studies,
and Opinions." The other parts are entitled, "Ephe|merides,
ou Journal de ma Vie, de mes Etudes, et de
mes Sentimens." In this Journal, among the mo&s;t tri|vial
circum&s;tances, are mixed very intere&s;ting ob&s;ervations
and di&s;&s;ertations on a Satire of Juvenal, a Pa&s;&s;age of
Homer, or of Longinus, or of any other author who&s;e
works he happened to read in the cour&s;e of the day; and
he often pa&s;&s;es from a Remark on the mo&s;t common
event, to a critical Di&s;qui&s;ition of con&s;iderable learning,
or an Enquiry into &s;ome ab&s;tru&s;e point of Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>It certainly was not his intention that this private and
motley Diary &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the Public; nor
have I thought my&s;elf at liberty to pre&s;ent it, in the
&s;hape in which he left it. But by reducing it to an ac|count
of <HI>his literary occupations,</HI> it formed &s;o &s;ingular
and &s;o intere&s;ting a portrait of an indefatigable Stu|dent,
that I per&s;uade my&s;elf it will be regarded as a
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
valuable acqui&s;ition by the Literary World, and as an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of fame to the memory of my Friend. With the
Extracts from Mr. Gibbon's Journal will be printed,
his Di&s;&s;ertations entitled "Extraits rai&s;onn&eacute;s de mes
Lectures:" and "Recueil de mes Ob&s;ervations, et
Pieces d&eacute;tach&eacute;es &s;ur diff&eacute;rens Sujets." A few other
pa&s;&s;ages from other parts of the Journals, introduced
in Notes, will make a curious addition to the Memoirs.</P>
<P>His Fir&s;t Publication, "E&s;&s;ai &s;ur l'Etude de la
Litterature," with corrections and additions from an
interleaved copy which my Friend gave to me &s;everal
years ago, is reprinted as part of the&s;e volumes.</P>
<P>Three more of his &s;maller Publications are al&s;o re|printed.
1. His ma&s;terly Critici&s;m on the Sixth Book
of Virgil, in an&s;wer to Bi&s;hop Warburton. 2. His
own Vindication of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chapters
of his Hi&s;tory, in an&s;wer to Mr. Davis and others. And
3. His "Repon&s;e &agrave; l'Expo&s;&eacute; de la Cour de France,"&mdash;an
occa&s;ional compo&s;ition, which obtained the highe&s;t ap|plau&s;e
in Foreign Courts, and of which he &s;poke to me
with &s;ome plea&s;ure, ob&s;erving that it had been tran&s;|lated
even into the Turki&s;h language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Peter&s;burgh and Vienna it was currently ob&s;erved by the Corps Diplomatique, that the Engli&s;h Mini&s;try had publi&s;hed a Memorial written not only with great ability, but al&s;o in French, &s;o correct, that they mu&s;t have employed a Frenchman.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e various writings the Author has &s;poken him|&s;elf,
in de&s;cribing his own Life. I have yet to notice
<PB N="x" REF="10">
&s;ome articles not mentioned in his Memoirs, and which
will be found in this Publication. 1. A juvenile &s;ketch,
entitled, "Outlines of the Hi&s;tory of the World."
2. A Di&s;&s;ertation, which he had &s;hewn to a few friends,
on that curious &s;ubject, "L'Homme au Ma&s;que de Fer."
3. A more con&s;iderable work, "The Antiquities of the
Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick;" an hi&s;torical di&s;cour&s;e, com|po&s;ed
about the year 1790. In this Work he intended
to appropriate &s;eparate books: 1. To the Italian de&s;cent;
2. To the Germanic reign: and, 3. To the Briti&s;h Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick. The Manu&s;cript
clo&s;es in completing the Italian branch of his &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t &s;plendid pa&s;&s;ages of that unfi|ni&s;hed
work may be enumerated, the characters of Leib|nitz
and Muratori: A &s;ketch of Albert-Azo the Second,
a prince who retained his faculties and reputation
beyond the age of one hundred years: An account
of Padua and its univer&s;ity, and remarks on the epic
glory of Ferrara.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Paper of the&s;e Volumes has the mournful at|traction
of being a &s;ketch interrupted by death, and affords
an honourable proof that my Friend's ardour for the pro|motion
of hi&s;torical knowledge attended him to the la&s;t.
It is entitled merely, "An Addre&s;s;" and expre&s;&s;es a
wi&s;h that our Latin memorials of the middle ages, the
"Scriptores Rerum Anglicarum," may be publi&s;hed in
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
England, in a manner worthy of the &s;ubject, and of the
country. He mentions Mr. John Pinkerton as a per&s;on
well qualified for the conduct of &s;uch a national under|taking.</P>
<P>In the collection of writings which I am now &s;end|ing
to the pre&s;s, there is no article that will &s;o much
engage the public attention as the Memoirs. I will
therefore clo&s;e all I mean to &s;ay as their Editor, by
a&s;&s;uring the Reader, that, although I have in &s;ome
mea&s;ure newly arranged tho&s;e intere&s;ting Papers, by
forming one regular narrative from the Six different
&s;ketches, I have neverthele&s;s adhered with &s;crupulous
fidelity to the very words of their Author; and I u&s;e
the letter S. to mark &s;uch Notes of my own, as it &s;eemed
nece&s;&s;ary to add.</P>
<P>It remains only to expre&s;s a wi&s;h, that in di&s;charging
this late&s;t office of affection, my regard to the memory of
my Friend may appear, as I tru&s;t it will do, proportioned
to the high &s;atisfaction which I enjoyed for many years in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his entire confidence, and very partial attach|ment.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF
MY LIFE AND WRITINGS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fifty-&s;econd year of my age, after the completion of an
arduous and &s;ucce&s;sful work, I now propo&s;e to employ &s;ome
moments of my lei&s;ure in reviewing the &s;imple tran&s;actions of a
private and literary life. Truth, naked, unblu&s;hing truth, the fir&s;t
virtue of more &s;erious hi&s;tory, mu&s;t be the &s;ole recommendation of
this per&s;onal narrative. The &s;tyle &s;hall be &s;imple and familiar: but
&s;tyle is the image of character; and the habits of correct writing
may produce, without labour or de&s;ign, the appearance of art and
&s;tudy. My own amu&s;ement is my motive, and will be my reward:
and if the&s;e &s;heets are communicated to &s;ome di&s;creet and indulgent
friends, they will be &s;ecreted from the public eye till the author &s;hall
be removed beyond the reach of critici&s;m or ridicule<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This pa&s;&s;age is found in one only of the &s;ix &s;ketches, and in that which &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t written, and which was laid a&s;ide among loo&s;e papers. Mr. Gibbon, in his communications with me on the &s;ubject of his Memoirs, a &s;ubject which he had never mentioned to any other per&s;on, expre&s;&s;ed a determination of publi&s;hing them in his lifetime; and never appears to have departed from that re&s;olution, excepting in one of his letters annexed, in which he intimates a doubt, though rather carele&s;sly, whether in his time, or at any time, they would meet the eye of the public.&mdash;In a conver&s;ation, however, not long before his death, it was &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that, if he &s;hould make them a full image of his mind, he would not have nerves to publi&s;h them in his lifetime, and therefore that they &s;hould be po&s;thumous;&mdash;He an&s;wered, rather eagerly, that he was determined to publi&s;h them <HI>in his lifetime.</HI> S.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="27">
A lively de&s;ire of knowing and of recording our ance&s;tors &s;o gene|rally
prevails, that it mu&s;t depend on the influence of &s;ome common
principle in the minds of men. We &s;eem to have lived in the per|&s;ons
of our forefathers; it is the labour and reward of vanity to ex|tend
the term of this ideal longevity. Our imagination is always
active to enlarge the narrow circle in which Nature has confined us.
Fifty or an hundred years may be allotted to an individual, but we
&s;tep forwards beyond death with &s;uch hopes as religion and philo|&s;ophy
will &s;ugge&s;t; and we fill up the &s;ilent vacancy that precedes
our birth, by a&s;&s;ociating our&s;elves to the authors of our exi&s;tence.
Our calmer judgment will rather tend to moderate, than to &s;uppre&s;s,
the pride of an antient and worthy race. The &s;atyri&s;t may laugh,
the philo&s;opher may preach; but Rea&s;on her&s;elf will re&s;pect the pre|judices
and habits, which have been con&s;ecrated by the experience of
mankind.</P>
<P>Wherever the di&s;tinction of birth is allowed to form a &s;uperior
order in the &s;tate, education and example &s;hould always, and will
often, produce among them a dignity of &s;entiment and propriety of
conduct, which is guarded from di&s;honour by their own and the
public e&s;teem. If we read of &s;ome illu&s;trious line &s;o antient that it
has no beginning, &s;o worthy that it ought to have no end, we &s;ym|pathize
in its various fortunes; nor can we blame the generous en|thu&s;ia&s;m,
or even the harmle&s;s vanity, of tho&s;e who are allied to
the honours of its name. For my own part, could I draw my pedi|gree
from a general, a &s;tate&s;man, or a celebrated author, I &s;hould
&s;tudy their lives with the diligence of filial love. In the inve&s;tiga|tion
of pa&s;t events, our curio&s;ity is &s;timulated by the immediate or
indirect reference to our&s;elves; but in the e&s;timate of honour we
&s;hould learn to value the gifts of Nature above tho&s;e of Fortune; to
e&s;teem in our ance&s;tors the qualities that be&s;t promote the intere&s;ts of
&s;ociety; and to pronounce the de&s;cendant of a king le&s;s truly noble
than the offspring of a man of genius, who&s;e writings will in&s;truct
<PB N="3" REF="28">
or delight the late&s;t po&s;terity. The family of Confucius is, in my
opinion, the mo&s;t illu&s;trious in the world. After a painful a&s;cent of
eight or ten centuries, our barons and princes of Europe are lo&s;t in
the darkne&s;s of the middle ages; but, in the va&s;t equality of the em|pire
of China, the po&s;terity of Confucius have maintained, above two
thou&s;and two hundred years, their peaceful honours and perpetual
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The chief of the family is &s;till revered, by the &s;overeign
and the people, as the lively image of the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind. The
nobility of the Spencers has been illu&s;trated and enriched by the tro|phies
of Marlborough; but I exhort them to con&s;ider the <HI>Fairy Queen</HI>
as the mo&s;t precious jewel of their coronet. I have expo&s;ed my pri|vate
feelings, as I &s;hall always do, without &s;cruple or re&s;erve. That
the&s;e &s;entiments are ju&s;t, or at lea&s;t natural, I am inclined to believe,
&s;ince I do not feel my&s;elf intere&s;ted in the cau&s;e; for I can derive
from my ance&s;tors neither glory nor &s;hame.</P>
<P>Yet a &s;incere and &s;imple narrative of my own life may amu&s;e &s;ome
of my lei&s;ure hours; but it will &s;ubject me, and perhaps with ju&s;tice,
to the imputation of vanity. I may judge, however, from the ex|perience
both of pa&s;t and of the pre&s;ent times, that the public are
always curious to know the men, who have left behind them any
image of their minds: the mo&s;t &s;canty accounts of &s;uch men are
compiled with diligence, and peru&s;ed with eagerne&s;s; and the &s;tudent
of every cla&s;s may derive a le&s;&s;on, or an example, from the lives mo&s;t
&s;imilar to his own. My name may hereafter be placed among the
thou&s;and articles of a Biographia Britannica; and I mu&s;t be con&s;cious,
that no one is &s;o well qualified, as my&s;elf, to de&s;cribe the &s;eries of my
thoughts and actions. The authority of my ma&s;ters, of the grave
Thuanus, and the philo&s;ophic Hume, might be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify
my de&s;ign; but it would not be difficult to produce a long li&s;t of
antients and moderns, who, in various forms, have exhibited their
own portraits. Such portraits are often the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, and
&s;ometimes the only intere&s;ting parts of their writings; and, if they
<PB N="4" REF="29">
be &s;incere, we &s;eldom complain of the minutene&s;s or prolixity of
the&s;e per&s;onal memorials. The lives of the younger Pliny, of Pe|trarch,
and of Era&s;mus, are expre&s;&s;ed in the epi&s;tles, which they
them&s;elves have given to the world. The e&s;&s;ays of Montagne and
Sir William Temple bring us home to the hou&s;es and bo&s;oms of the
authors: we &s;mile without contempt at the head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions of
Benevenuto Cellini, and the gay follies of Colley Cibber. The con|fe&s;&s;ions
of St. Au&s;tin and Rou&s;&s;eau di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecrets of the human
heart: the commentaries of the learned Huet have &s;urvived his evan|gelical
demon&s;tration; and the memoirs of Goldoni are more truly
dramatic than his Italian comedies. The heretic and the churchman
are &s;trongly marked in the characters and fortunes of Whi&s;ton and
Bi&s;hop Newton; and even the dullne&s;s of Michael de Marolles and
Anthony Wood acquires &s;ome value from the faithful repre&s;entation
of men and manners. That I am equal or &s;uperior to &s;ome of the&s;e,
the effects of mode&s;ty or affectation cannot force me to di&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>MY family is originally derived from the county of Kent. The
&s;outhern di&s;trict, which borders on Su&s;&s;ex and the &s;ea, was formerly
over&s;pread with the great fore&s;t Anderida, and even now retains the
denomination of the <HI>Weald,</HI> or Woodland. In this di&s;trict, and in the
hundred and pari&s;h of Rolvenden, the Gibbons, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
lands in the year one thou&s;and three hundred and twenty-&s;ix; and
the elder branch of the family, without much increa&s;e or diminution
of property, &s;till adheres to its native &s;oil. Fourteen years after the
fir&s;t appearance of his name, John Gibbon is recorded as the Mar|morarius
or architect of King Edward the Third: the &s;trong and
&s;tately ca&s;tle of Queen&s;borough, which guarded the entrance of the
Medway, was a monument of his &s;kill; and the grant of an here|ditary
toll on the pa&s;&s;age from Sandwich to Stonar, in the I&s;le of
<PB N="5" REF="30">
Thanet, is the reward of no vulgar arti&s;t. In the vi&s;itations of the
heralds, the Gibbons are frequently mentioned: they held the rank
of E&s;quire in an age, when that title was le&s;s promi&s;cuou&s;ly a&s;&s;umed:
one of them, under the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was captain of the
militia of Kent; and a free &s;chool, in the neighbouring town of Be|nenden,
proclaims the charity and opulence of its founder. But time,
or their own ob&s;curity, has ca&s;t a veil of oblivion over the virtues
and vices of my Kenti&s;h ance&s;tors; their character or &s;tation confined
them to the labours and plea&s;ures of a rural life: nor is it in my power
to follow the advice of the Poet, in an inquiry after a name&mdash;
<Q><L>"Go! &s;earch it there, where to be born, and die,</L>
<L>"Of rich and poor makes all the hi&s;tory."</L></Q>
So recent is the in&s;titution of our pari&s;h regi&s;ters. In the beginning
of the &s;eventeenth century, a younger branch of the Gibbons of Rol|venden
migrated from the country to the city; and from this branch
I do not blu&s;h to de&s;cend. The law requires &s;ome abilities; the
church impo&s;es &s;ome re&s;traints; and before our army and navy, our
civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, and India empire, had opened &s;o many paths of
fortune, the mercantile profe&s;&s;ion was more frequently cho&s;en by
youths of a liberal race and education, who a&s;pired to create their
own independence. Our mo&s;t re&s;pectable families have not di&s;|dained
the counting-hou&s;e, or even the &s;hop; their names are in|rolled
in the Livery and Companies of London; and in England,
as well as in the Italian commonwealths, heralds have been com|pelled
to declare, that gentility is not degraded by the exerci&s;e of
trade.</P>
<P>The armorial en&s;igns which, in the times of chivalry, adorned the
cre&s;t and &s;hield of the &s;oldier, are now become an empty decoration,
which every man, who has money to build a carriage, may paint ac|cording
to his fancy on the pannels. My family arms are the &s;ame,
which were borne by the Gibbons of Kent in an age, when the
College of Heralds religiou&s;ly guarded the di&s;tinctions of blood and
<PB N="6" REF="31">
name: a lion rampant gardant, between three &s;challop-&s;hells Argent,
on a field Azure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The father of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke married an heire&s;s of this family of Gibbon. The Chancellor's e&s;cutcheon in the Temple Hall quarters the arms of Gibbon, as does al&s;o that, in Lincoln's Inn Hall, of Charles York, Chancellor in 1770. S.</NOTE>. I &s;hould not however have been tempted to
blazon my coat of arms, were it not connected with a whim&s;ical
anecdote.&mdash;About the reign of James the Fir&s;t, the three harmle&s;s
&s;challop-&s;hells were changed by Edmund Gibbon e&s;q. into three
<HI>Ogre&s;&s;es,</HI> or female cannibals, with a de&s;ign of &s;tigmatizing three
ladies, his kin&s;women, who had provoked him by an unju&s;t law-&s;uit.
But this &s;ingular mode of revenge, for which he obtained the &s;anction
of Sir William Seagar, king at arms, &s;oon expired with its author;
and, on his own monument in the Temple church, the mon&s;ters
vani&s;h, and the three &s;challop-&s;hells re&s;ume their proper and heredi|tary
place.</P>
<P>Our alliances by marriage it is not di&s;graceful to mention. The
chief honour of my ance&s;try is James Fiens, Baron Say and Seale,
and Lord High Trea&s;urer of England, in the reign of Henry the
Sixth; from whom by the Phelips, the Whetnalls, and the Cromers,
I am lineally de&s;cended in the eleventh degree. His di&s;mi&s;&s;ion and
impri&s;onment in the Tower were in&s;ufficient to appea&s;e the popular
clamour; and the Trea&s;urer, with his &s;on-in-law Cromer, was be|headed
(1450), after a mock trial by the Kenti&s;h in&s;urgents. The
black li&s;t of his offences, as it is exhibited in Shake&s;peare, di&s;plays
the ignorance and envy of a plebeian tyrant. Be&s;ides the vague
reproaches of &s;elling Maine and Normandy to the Dauphin, the
Trea&s;urer is &s;pecially accu&s;ed of luxury, for riding on a foot-cloth;
and of trea&s;on, for &s;peaking French, the language of our enemies:
<Q>Thou ha&s;t mo&s;t traiterou&s;ly corrupted the youth of the realm,</Q> &s;ays
Jack Cade to the unfortunate Lord, <Q>in erecting a grammar-&s;chool;
and whereas before our forefathers had no other books than the
&s;core and the tally, thou ha&s;t cau&s;ed printing to be u&s;ed; and,
<PB N="7" REF="32">
contrary to the king, his crown, and dignity, thou ha&s;t built a
paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face, that thou ha&s;t men
about thee, who u&s;ually talk of a noun and a verb, and &s;uch abo|minable
words, as no chri&s;tian ear can endure to hear.</Q> Our dra|matic
poet is generally more attentive to character than to hi&s;tory;
and I much fear that the art of printing was not introduced into
England, till &s;everal years after Lord Say's death: but of &s;ome of
the&s;e meritorious crimes I &s;hould hope to find my ance&s;tor guilty;
and a man of letters may be proud of his de&s;cent from a patron and
martyr of learning.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the la&s;t century Robert Gibbon e&s;q. of Rol|venden
in Kent, (who died in 1618,) had a &s;on of the &s;ame name of
Robert, who &s;ettled in London, and became a member of the Cloth-workers'
Company. His wife was a daughter of the Edgars, who
flouri&s;hed about four hundred years in the county of Suffolk, and
produced an eminent and wealthy &s;erjeant-at-law, Sir Gregory Edgar,
in the reign of Henry the Seventh. Of the &s;ons of Robert Gibbon,
(who died in 1643,) Matthew did not a&s;pire above the &s;tation of a
linen-draper in Leadenhall-&s;treet; but John has given to the public
&s;ome curious memorials of his exi&s;tence, his character, and his family.
He was born on the 3d of November in the year 1629; his education
was liberal, at a grammar-&s;chool, and afterwards in Je&s;us College at
Cambridge; and he celebrates the retired content which he enjoyed
at Alle&s;borough in Worce&s;ter&s;hire, in the hou&s;e of Thomas Lord Co|ventry,
where John Gibbon was employed as a dome&s;tic tutor, the
&s;ame office which Mr. Hobbes exerci&s;ed in the Devon&s;hire family.
But the &s;pirit of my kin&s;man &s;oon immerged into more active life:
he vi&s;ited foreign countries as a &s;oldier and a traveller, acquired the
knowledge of the French and Spani&s;h languages, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time
in the I&s;le of Jer&s;ey, cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic, and re&s;ided upwards of a
twelvemonth (1659) in the ri&s;ing colony of Virginia. In this remote
province, his ta&s;te, or rather pa&s;&s;ion, for heraldry found a &s;ingular
<PB N="8" REF="33">
gratification at a war-dance of the native Indians. As they moved
in mea&s;ured &s;teps, brandi&s;hing their tomahawks, his curious eye con|templated
their little &s;hields of bark, and their naked bodies, which
were painted with the colours and &s;ymbols of his favourite &s;cience.
<Q>At which I exceedingly wondered; and concluded that heraldry
was ingrafted <HI>naturally</HI> into the &s;en&s;e of human race. If &s;o, it
de&s;erves a greater e&s;teem than now-a-days is put upon it.</Q> His
return to England after the Re&s;toration was &s;oon followed by his
marraige&mdash;his &s;ettlement in a hou&s;e in St. Catherine's Cloy&s;ter, near
the Tower, which devolved to my grandfather&mdash;and his introduc|tion
into the Heralds' College (in 1671) by the &s;tyle and title of
Blue-mantle Pur&s;uivant at Arms. In this office he enjoyed near fifty
years the rare felicity of uniting, in the &s;ame pur&s;uit, his duty and
inclination: his name is remembered in the College, and many of
his letters are &s;till pre&s;erved. Several of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable cha|racters
of the age, Sir William Dugdale, Mr. A&s;hmole, Dr. John
Betts, and Dr. Nehemiah Grew, were his friends; and in the &s;ociety
of &s;uch men, John Gibbon may be recorded without di&s;grace as the
member of an a&s;trological club. The &s;tudy of hereditary honours is
favourable to the Royal prerogative; and my kin&s;man, like mo&s;t of
his family, was a high Tory both in church and &s;tate. In the latter
end of the reign of Charles the Second, his pen was exerci&s;ed in the
cau&s;e of the Duke of York: the Republican faction he mo&s;t cordially
dete&s;ted; and as each animal is con&s;cious of its proper arms, the
heralds' revenge was emblazoned on a mo&s;t diabolical e&s;cutcheon.
But the triumph of the Whig government checked the preferment
of Blue-mantle; and he was even &s;u&s;pended from his office, till his
tongue could learn to pronounce the oath of abjuration. His life
was prolonged to the age of ninety; and, in the expectation of the
inevitable though uncertain hour, he wi&s;hes to pre&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ings
of health, competence, and virtue. In the year 1682 he publi&s;hed
at London his <HI>Introductio ad Latinam Blafoniam,</HI> an original attempt,
<PB N="9" REF="34">
which Camden had de&s;iderated, to define, in a Roman idiom, the
terms and attributes of a Gothic in&s;titution. It is not two years
&s;ince I acquired, in a foreign land, &s;ome dome&s;tic intelligence of my
own family; and this intelligence was conveyed to Switzerland from
the heart of Germany. I had formed an acquaintance with Mr.
<HI>Langer,</HI> a lively and ingenious &s;cholar, while he re&s;ided at Lau&s;anne
as preceptor to the Hereditary Prince of <HI>Brun&s;wick.</HI> On his return
to his proper &s;tation of Librarian to the Ducal Library of Wolfen|buttel,
he accidentally found among &s;ome literary rubbi&s;h a &s;mall old
Engli&s;h volume of heraldry, in&s;cribed with the name of <HI>John Gibbon.</HI>
From the title only Mr. <HI>Langer</HI> judged that it might be an acceptable
pre&s;ent to his friend; and he judged rightly. His manner is quaint
and affected; his order is confu&s;ed; but he di&s;plays &s;ome wit, more
reading, and &s;till more enthu&s;ia&s;m; and if an enthu&s;ia&s;t be often ab|&s;urd,
he is never languid. An Engli&s;h text is perpetually inter|&s;per&s;ed
with Latin &s;entences in pro&s;e and ver&s;e; but in his own
poetry he claims an exemption from the laws of pro&s;ody. Amid&s;t a
profu&s;ion of genealogical knowledge, my kin&s;man could not be for|getful
of his own name; and to him I am indebted for almo&s;t the
whole of my information concerning the Gibbon family. From this
&s;mall work (a duodecimo of one hundred and &s;ixty-five pages) the
author expected immortal fame: and at the conclu&s;ion of his labour
he &s;ings, in a &s;train of &s;elf-exultation;</P>
<LG>
<L>"U&s;que huc corrigitur Romana Bla&s;onia per me;</L>
<L>"Verborumque dehinc barbara forma cadat.</L>
<L>"Hic liber, in meritum &s;i for&s;itan incidet u&s;um,</L>
<L>"Testis rite meae &s;edulitatis erit.</L>
<L>"Quicquid agat Zoilus, ventura fatebitur aetas</L>
<L>"Artis qu&ocirc;d fueram non Clypearis inops."</L>
</LG>
<P>Such are the hopes of authors! In the failure of tho&s;e hopes John
Gibbon has not been the fir&s;t of his profe&s;&s;ion, and very po&s;&s;ibly
may not be the la&s;t of his name. His brother Matthew Gibbon, the
<PB N="10" REF="35">
draper, had one daughter and two &s;ons&mdash;my grandfather Edward,
who was born in the year 1666, and Thomas, afterwards Dean of
Carli&s;le. According to the mercantile creed, that the be&s;t book is a
profitable ledger, the writings of John the herald would be much le&s;s
precious, than tho&s;e of his nephew Edward: but an author profe&s;&s;es
at lea&s;t to write for the public benefit; and the &s;low balance of trade
can be plea&s;ing to tho&s;e per&s;ons only, to whom it is advantageous.
The &s;ucce&s;sful indu&s;try of my grandfather rai&s;ed him above the level
of his immediate ance&s;tors; he appears to have launched into various
and exten&s;ive dealings: even his opinions were &s;ubordinate to his
intere&s;t; and I find him in Flanders clothing King William's troops,
while he would have contracted with more plea&s;ure, though not per|haps
at a cheaper rate, for the &s;ervice of King James. During his
re&s;idence abroad, his concerns at home were managed by his mother
He&s;ter, an active and notable woman. Her &s;econd hu&s;band was a
widower, of the name of Acton: they united the children of their
fir&s;t nuptials. After his marriage with the daughter of Richard
Acton, gold&s;mith in Leadenhall-&s;treet, he gave his own &s;i&s;ter to Sir
Whitmore Acton, of Aldenham; and I am thus connected, by a
triple alliance, with that ancient and loyal family of Shrop&s;hire ba|ronets.
It con&s;i&s;ted about that time of &s;even brothers, all of gigan|tic
&s;tature; one of whom, a pigmy of &s;ix feet two inches, confe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf the la&s;t and lea&s;t of the &s;even; adding, in the true &s;pirit of
party, that &s;uch men were not born &s;ince the Revolution. Under
the Tory admini&s;tration of the four la&s;t years of Queen Anne
(1710&mdash;1714) Mr. Edward Gibbon was appointed one of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
of the Cu&s;toms; he &s;at at that Board with Prior: but the
merchant was better qualified for his &s;tation than the poet; &s;ince Lord
Bolingbroke has been heard to declare, that he had never conver&s;ed
with a man, who more clearly under&s;tood the commerce and finances
of England. In the year 1716 he was elected one of the Directors
of the South Sea Company; and his books exhibited the proof that,
<PB N="11" REF="36">
before his acceptance of this fatal office, he had acquired an inde|pendent
fortune of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>But his fortune was overwhelmed in the &s;hipwreck of the year
twenty, and the labours of thirty years were bla&s;ted in a &s;ingle day.
Of the u&s;e or abu&s;e of the South Sea &s;cheme, of the guilt or inno|cence
of my grandfather and his brother Directors, I am neither a
competent nor a di&s;intere&s;ted judge. Yet the equity of modern times
mu&s;t condemn the violent and arbitrary proceedings, which would
have di&s;graced the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, and would render inju&s;tice &s;till
more odious. No &s;ooner had the nation awakened from its golden
dream, than a popular and even a parliamentary clamour demanded
their victims: but it was acknolwedged on all &s;ides that the South
Sea Directors, however guilty, could not be touched by any known
laws of the lands. The &s;peech of Lord Mole&s;worth, the author of the
State of Denmark, may &s;hew the temper, or rather the intemperance,
of the Hou&s;e of Commons. <Q>Extraordinary crimes (exclaimed that
ardent Whig) call aloud for extraordinary remedies. The Roman
lawgivers had not fore&s;een the po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence of a parricide:
but as &s;oon as the fir&s;t mon&s;ter appeared, he was &s;own in a &s;ack, and
ca&s;t headlong into the river; and I &s;hall be content to inflict the
&s;ame treatment on the authors of our pre&s;ent ruin.</Q> His motion
was not literally adopted; but a bill of pains and penalties was intro|duced,
a retroactive &s;tatute, to puni&s;h the offences, which did not
exi&s;t at the time they were committed. Such a pernicious violation
of liberty and law can be excu&s;ed only by the mo&s;t imperious nece&s;|&s;ity;
nor could it be defended on this occa&s;ion by the plea of impend|ing
danger or u&s;eful example. The legi&s;lature re&s;trained the per&s;ons
of the Directors, impo&s;ed an exorbitant &s;ecurity for their appearance,
and marked their characters with a previous note of ignominy: they
were compelled to deliver, upon oath, the &s;trict value of their e&s;tates;
and were di&s;abled from making any transfer or alienation of any
part of their property. Again&s;t a bill of pains and penalties it is the
<PB N="12" REF="37">
common right of every &s;ubject to be heard by his coun&s;el at the bar:
they prayed to be heard; their prayer was refu&s;ed; and their op|pre&s;&s;ors,
who required no evidence, would li&s;ten to no defence. It
had been at fir&s;t propo&s;ed that one-eighth of their re&s;pective e&s;tates
&s;hould be allowed for the future &s;upport of the Directors; but it was
&s;peciou&s;ly urged, that in the various &s;hades of opulence and guilt &s;uch
an unequal proportion would be too light for many, and for &s;ome
might po&s;&s;ibly be too heavy. The character and conduct of each
man were &s;eparately weighed; but, in&s;tead of the calm &s;olemnity of
a judicial inquiry, the fortune and honour of three and thirty Eng|li&s;hmen
were made the topic of ha&s;ty conver&s;ation, the &s;port of a
lawle&s;s majority; and the ba&s;e&s;t member of the committee, by a ma|licious
word or a &s;ilent vote, might indulge his general &s;pleen or per|&s;onal
animo&s;ity. Injury was aggravated by in&s;ult, and in&s;ult was em|bittered
by plea&s;antry. Allowances of twenty pounds, or one &s;hilling,
were facetiou&s;ly moved. A vague report that a Director had for|merly
been concerned in <HI>another</HI> project, by which &s;ome unknown
per&s;ons had lo&s;t their money, was admitted as a proof of his actual
guilt. One man was ruined becau&s;e he had dropt a fooli&s;h &s;peech, that
his hor&s;es &s;hould feed upon gold; another becau&s;e he was grown &s;o
proud, that, one day at the Trea&s;ury, he had refu&s;ed a civil an&s;wer
to per&s;ons much above him. All were condemned, ab&s;ent and un|heard,
in arbitrary fines and forfeitures, which &s;wept away the greate&s;t
part of their &s;ub&s;tance. Such bold oppre&s;&s;ion can &s;carcely be &s;hielded
by the omnipotence of parliament: and yet it may be &s;eriou&s;ly
que&s;tioned, whether the Judges of the South Sea Directors were the
true and legal repre&s;entatives of their country. The fir&s;t parliament
of George the Fir&s;t had been cho&s;en (1715) for thre years: the
term had elap&s;ed, their tru&s;t was expired; and the four additional
years (1718&mdash;1722), during which they continued to &s;it, were de|rived
not from the people, but from them&s;elves; from the &s;trong
mea&s;ure of the &s;eptennial bill, which can only be paralleled by <HI>il &s;erar
<PB N="13" REF="38">
di con&s;iglio</HI> of the Venetian hi&s;tory. Yet candour will own that to the
&s;ame parliament every Engli&s;hman is deeply indebted: the &s;eptennial
act, &s;o vicious in its origin, has been &s;anctioned by time, experience,
and the national con&s;ent. Its fir&s;t operation &s;ecured the Hou&s;e of
Hanover on the throne, and its permanent influence maintains the
peace and &s;tability of government. As often as a repeal has been
moved in the Hou&s;e of Commons, I have given in its defence a clear
and con&s;cientious vote.</P>
<P>My grandfather could not expect to be treated with more lenity
than his companions. His Tory principles and connections rendered
him obnoxious to the ruling powers: his name is reported in a &s;u&s;|picious
&s;ecret; and his well-known abilities could not plead the ex|cu&s;e
of ignorance or error. In the fir&s;t proceedings again&s;t the South
Sea Directors, Mr. Gibbon is one of the few who were taken into
cu&s;tody; and, in the final &s;entence, the mea&s;ure of his fine proclaims
him eminently guilty. The total e&s;timate which he delivered on
oath to the Hou&s;e of Commons amounted to one hundred and &s;ix
thou&s;and five hundred and forty-three pounds five &s;hillings and &s;ix|pence,
exclu&s;ive of antecedent &s;ettlements. Two different allow|ances
of fifteen and of ten thou&s;and pounds were moved for Mr.
Gibbon; but, on the que&s;tion being put, it was carried without a
divi&s;ion for the &s;maller &s;um. On the&s;e ruins, with the &s;kill and
credit, of which parliament had not been able to de&s;poil him, my
grandfather at a mature age erected the edifice of a new fortune:
the labours of &s;ixteen years were amply rewarded; and I have rea&s;on
to believe that the &s;econd &s;tructure was not much inferior to the fir&s;t.
He had realized a very con&s;iderable property in Su&s;&s;ex, Hamp&s;hire,
Buckingham&s;hire, and the New River Company; and had acquired
a &s;pacious hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since inhabited by Mr. Wood, Sir John Shelley, the Duke of Norfolk, &amp;c. S.</NOTE>, with gardens and lands, at Putney, in Surry,
where he re&s;ided in decent ho&s;pitality. He died in December 1736,
<PB N="14" REF="39">
at the age of &s;eventy; and by his la&s;t will, at the expence of Edward,
his only &s;on, (with who&s;e marriage he was not perfectly reconciled,)
enriched his two daughters, Catherine and He&s;ter. The former became
the wife of Mr. Edward Elli&s;ton, an Ea&s;t India captain: their daugh|ter
and heire&s;s Catherine was married in the year 1756 to Edward
Eliot e&s;q. (now Lord Eliot), of Port Eliot, in the county of Cornwall;
and their three &s;ons are my neare&s;t male relations on the father's
&s;ide. A life of devotion and celibacy was the choice of my aunt, Mrs.
He&s;ter Gibbon, who, at the age of eighty-five, &s;till re&s;ides in a her|mitage
at Cliffe, in Northampton&s;hire; having long &s;urvived her
&s;piritual guide and faithful companion Mr. William Law, who, at
an advanced age, about the year 1761, died in her hou&s;e. In our
family he had left the reputation of a worthy and pious man, who
believed all that he profe&s;&s;ed, and practi&s;ed all that he enjoined.
The character of a nonjuror, which he maintained to the la&s;t, is a
&s;ufficient evidence of his principles in church and &s;tate; and the &s;a|crifice
of intere&s;t to con&s;icence will be always re&s;pectable. His the|ological
writings, which our dome&s;tic connection has tempted me to
peru&s;e, pre&s;erve an imperfect &s;ort of life, and I can pronounce with
more confidence and knowledge on the merits of the author. His
la&s;t compo&s;itions are darkly tinctured by the incomprehen&s;ible vi&s;ions
of Jacob Behmen; and his di&s;cour&s;e on the ab&s;olute unlawfulne&s;s of
&s;tage-entertainments is &s;ometimes quoted for a ridiculous intempe|rance
of &s;entiment and language.&mdash;<Q>The actors and &s;pectators mu&s;t
all be damned: the playhou&s;e is the porch of Hell, the place of
the Devil's abode, where he holds his filthy court of evil &s;pirits: a
play is the Devil's triumph, a &s;acrifice performed to his glory, as much
as in the heathen temples of Bacchus or Venus, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> But
the&s;e &s;allies of religious phren&s;y mu&s;t not extingui&s;h the prai&s;e, which
is due to Mr. William Law as a wit and a &s;cholar. His argument
on topics of le&s;s ab&s;urdity is &s;pecious and acute, his manner is lively,
his &s;tyle forcible and clear; and, had not his vigorous mind been
<PB N="15" REF="40">
clouded by enthu&s;ia&s;m, he might be ranked with the mo&s;t agreeable
and ingenious writers of the times. While the Bangorian controver&s;y
was a fa&s;hionable theme, he entered the li&s;ts on the &s;ubject of Chri&s;t's
kingdom, and the authority of the prie&s;thood: again&s;t the plain ac|count
of the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper he re&s;umed the com|bat
with Bi&s;hop Hoadley, the object of Whig idolatry, and Tory ab|horrence;
and at every weapon of attack and defence the nonjuror,
on the ground which is common to both, approves him&s;elf at lea&s;t
equal to the prelate. On the appearance of the Fable of the Bees, he
drew his pen again&s;t the licentious doctrine that private vices are
public benefits, and morality as well as religion mu&s;t join in his ap|plau&s;e.
Mr. Law's ma&s;ter-work, the <HI>Serious Call,</HI> is &s;till read as a
popular and powerful book of devotion. His precepts are rigid, but
they are founded on the go&s;pel: his &s;atire is &s;harp, but it is drawn
from the knowledge of human life; and many of his portraits are
not unworthy of the pen of La Bruyere. If he finds a &s;park of
piety in his reader's mind, he will &s;oon kindle it to a flame; and a
philo&s;opher mu&s;t allow that he expo&s;es, with equal &s;everity and truth,
the &s;trange contradiction between the faith and practice of the Chri&s;|tian
world. Under the names of Flavia and Miranda he has ad|mirably
de&s;cribed my two aunts&mdash;the heathen and the chri&s;tian
&s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>My father, Edward Gibbon, was born in October 1707: at the
age of thriteen he could &s;carcely feel that he was di&s;inherited by act
of parliament; and, as he advanced towards manhood, new pro&s;pects
of fortune opened to his view. A parent is mo&s;t attentive to &s;upply
in his children the deficiencies, of which he is con&s;cious in him&s;elf:
my grandfather's knowledge was derived from a &s;trong under|&s;tanding,
and the experience of the ways of men; but my father
enjoyed the benefits of a liberal education as a &s;cholar and a gentle|man.
At We&s;tmin&s;ter School, and afterwards at Emanuel College
in Cambridge, he pa&s;&s;ed through a regular cour&s;e of academical di&s;|cipline;
<PB N="16" REF="41">
and the care of his leanring and morals was entru&s;ted to his
private tutor, the &s;ame Mr. William Law. But the mind of a &s;aint
is above or below the pre&s;ent world; and while the pupil proceeded
on his travels, the tutor remained at Putney, the much-honoured
friend and &s;piritual director of the whole family. My father re&s;ided
&s;ome time at Paris to acquire the fa&s;hionable exerci&s;es; and as his
temper was warm and &s;ocial, he indulged in tho&s;e plea&s;ures, for which
the &s;trictne&s;s of his former education had given him a keener reli&s;h.
He afterwards vi&s;ited &s;everal provinces of France; but his excur&s;ions
were neither long nor remote; and the &s;lender knowledge, which he
had gained of the French language, was gradually obliterated. His
pa&s;&s;age through Be&s;an&ccedil;on is marked by a &s;ingular con&s;equence in the
chain of human events. In a dangerous illne&s;s Mr. Gibbon was at|tended,
at his own reque&s;t, by one of his kin&s;men of the name of
Acton, the younger brother of a younger brother, who had applied
him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic. During the &s;low recovery of his pa|tient,
the phy&s;ician him&s;elf was attacked by the malady of love:
he married his mi&s;tre&s;s, renounced his country and religion, &s;ettled at
Be&s;an&ccedil;on, and became the father of three &s;ons; the elde&s;t of whom,
General Acton, is con&s;picuous in Europe as the principal Mini&s;ter of
the King of the Two Sicilies. By an uncle whom another &s;troke of
fortune had tran&s;planted to Leghorn, he was educated in the naval
&s;ervice of the Emperor; and his valour and conduct in the command
of the Tu&s;can frigates protected the retreat of the Spaniards from Al|giers.
On my father's return to England he was cho&s;en, in the
general election of 1734, to &s;erve in parliament for the borough of
Petersfield; a burgage tenure, of which my grandfather po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
weighty &s;hare, till he alienated (I know not why) &s;uch important
property. In the oppo&s;ition to Sir Robert Walpole and the Pelhams,
prejudice and &s;ociety connected his &s;on with the Tories,&mdash;&s;hall I &s;ay
Jacobites? or, as they were plea&s;ed to &s;tyle them&s;elves, the country
gentlemen? with them he gave many a vote; with them he drank
<PB N="17" REF="42">
many a bottle. Without acquiring the fame of an orator or a &s;tate&s;|man,
he eagerly joined in the great oppo&s;ition, which, after a &s;even
years cha&s;e, hunted down Sir Robert Walpole: and in the pur&s;uit of an
unpopular mini&s;ter, he gratified a private revenge again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;or
of his family in the South Sea per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>I was born at Putney, in the county of Surry, the 27th of April,
O. S. in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty-&s;even; the
fir&s;t child of the marriage of Edward Gibbon e&s;q. and of Judith
Porten<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The union to which I owe my birth was a marriage of inclination and e&s;teem. Mr. James Porten, a merchant of London, re&s;ided with his family at Putney, in a hou&s;e adjoining to the bridge and church-yard, where I have pa&s;&s;ed many happy hours of my childhood. He left one &s;on (the late Sir Stanier Porten) and three daughters: Catherine, who pre&s;erved her maiden name, and of whom I &s;hall hereafter &s;peak; another daughter married Mr. Darrel of Richmond, and left two &s;ons, Edward and Robert: the younge&s;t of the three &s;i&s;ters was Judith, my mother.</NOTE>. My lot might have been that of a &s;lave, a &s;avage, or a
pea&s;ant; nor can I reflect without plea&s;ure on the bounty of Nature,
which ca&s;t my birth in a free and civilized country, in an age of
&s;cience and philo&s;ophy, in a family of honourable rank, and decently
endowed with the gifts of fortune. From my birth I have enjoyed
the right of primogeniture; but I was &s;ucceeded by five brothers and
one &s;i&s;ter, all of whom were &s;natched away in their infancy. My
five brothers, who&s;e names may be found in the pari&s;h regi&s;ter of
Putney, I &s;hall not pretend to lament: but from my childhood to
the pre&s;ent hour I have deeply and &s;incerely regretted my &s;i&s;ter,
who&s;e life was &s;omewhat prolonged, and whom I remember to have
&s;een an amiable infant. The relation of a brother and a &s;i&s;ter, e&s;pe|cially
if they do not marry, appears to me of a very &s;ingular nature.
It is a familiar and tender friend&s;hip with a female, much about
our own age; an affection perhaps &s;oftened by the &s;ecret influence
of &s;ex, but pure from any mixture of &s;en&s;ual de&s;ire, the &s;ole &s;pecies
of Platonic love that can be indulged with truth, and without
danger.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="43">
At the general election of 1741, Mr. Gibbon and Mr. Delm&eacute; &s;tood
an expen&s;ive and &s;ucce&s;sful conte&s;t at Southampton, again&s;t Mr. Dum|mer
and Mr. Henly, afterwards Lord Chancellor and Earl of North|ington.
The Whig candidates had a majority of the re&s;ident voters;
but the corporation was firm in the Tory intere&s;t: a &s;udden creation
of one hundred and &s;eventy new freemen turned the &s;cale; and a
&s;upply was readily obtained of re&s;pectable volunteers, who flocked
from all parts of England to &s;upport the cau&s;e of their political friends.
The new parliament opened with the victory of an oppo&s;ition, which
was fortified by &s;trong clamour and &s;trange coalitions. From the
event of the fir&s;t divi&s;ions, Sir Robert Walpole perceived that he
could no longer lead a majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and pru|dently
re&s;igned (after a dominion of one and twenty years) the
guidance of the &s;tate (1742). But the fall of an unpopular mini&s;ter
was not &s;ucceeded, according to general expectation, by a millenium
of happine&s;s and virtue: &s;ome courtiers lo&s;t their places, &s;ome pa|triots
lo&s;t their characters, Lord Orford's offences vani&s;hed with his
power; and after a &s;hort vibration, the Pelham government was fixed
on the old ba&s;is of the Whig ari&s;tocracy. In the year 1745, the
throne and the con&s;titution were attacked by a rebellion, which does
not reflect much honour on the national &s;pirit: &s;ince the Engli&s;h
friends of the Pretender wanted courage to join his &s;tandard, and his
enemies (the bulk of the people) allowed him to advance into the
heart of the kingdom. Without daring, perhaps without de&s;iring,
to aid the rebels, my father invariably adhered to the Tory oppo&s;i|tion.
In the mo&s;t critical &s;ea&s;on he accepted, for the &s;ervice of the
party, the office of alderman in the city of London: but the duties
were &s;o repugnant to his inclination and habits, that he re&s;igned his
gown at the end of a few months. The &s;econd parliament in which
he &s;at was prematurely di&s;&s;olved (1747): and as he was unable or
unwilling to maintain a &s;econd conte&s;t for Southampton, the life of
the &s;enator expired in that di&s;&s;olution.</P>

The death of a new-born child before that of its parents may &s;eem
an unnatural, but it is &s;trictly a probable, event: &s;ince of any given
number the greater part are extingui&s;hed before their ninth year,
before they po&s;&s;e&s;s the faculties of the mind or body. Without ac|cu&s;ing
the profu&s;e wa&s;te or imperfect workman&s;hiop of Nature, I &s;hall
only ob&s;erve, that this unfavourable chance was multiplied again&s;t my
infant exi&s;tence. So feeble was my con&s;titution, &s;o precarious my
life, that, in the bapti&s;m of each of my brothers, my father's pru|dence
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively repeated my chri&s;tian name of Edward, that, in
ca&s;e of the departure of the elde&s;t &s;on, this patronymick appellation
might be &s;till perpetuated in the family.
<Q>&mdash;Uno avul&s;o non deficit alter.</Q>
To pre&s;erve and to rear &s;o frail a being, the mo&s;t tender a&s;&s;iduity was
&s;carcely &s;ufficient; and my mother's attention was &s;omewhat diverted
by her frequent pregnancies, by an exclu&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion for her hu&s;band,
and by the di&s;&s;ipation of the world, in which his ta&s;te and authority
obliged her to mingle. But the maternal office was &s;upplied by my
aunt, Mrs. Catherine Porten; at who&s;e name I feel a tear of grati|tude
trickling down my cheek. A life of celibacy transferred her
vacant affection to her &s;i&s;ter's fir&s;t child: my weakne&s;s excited her
pity; her attachment was fortified by labour and &s;ucce&s;s: and if there
be any, as I tru&s;t there are &s;ome, who rejoice that I live, to that
dear and excellent woman they mu&s;t hold them&s;elves indebted.
Many anxious and &s;olitary days did &s;he con&s;ume in the patient trial
of every mode of relief and amu&s;ement. Many wakeful nights did
&s;he &s;it by my bed-&s;ide in trembling expectation that each hour would
be my la&s;t. Of the various and frequent di&s;orders of my childhood
my own recollection is dark; nor do I wi&s;h to expatiate on &s;o di&s;|gu&s;ting
a topic. Suffice it to &s;ay, that while every practitioner, from
Sloane and Ward to the Chevalier Taylor, was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;um|moned
to torture or relieve me, the care of my mind was too fre|quently
neglected for that of my health: compa&s;&s;ion always &s;ugge&s;ted
<PB N="20" REF="45">
an excu&s;e for the indulgence of the ma&s;ter, or the idlene&s;s of the
pupil; and the chain of my education was broken, as often as I was
recalled from the &s;chool of learning to the bed of &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the u&s;e of &s;peech had prepared my infant rea&s;on for the
admi&s;&s;ion of knowledge, I was taught the arts of reading, writing,
and arithmetic. So remote is the date, &s;o vague is the memory of
their origin in my&s;elf, that, were not the error corrected by analogy,
I &s;hould be tempted to conceive them as innate. In my childhood
I was prai&s;ed for the readine&s;s, with which I could multiply and di|vide,
by memory alone, two &s;ums of &s;everal figures: &s;uch prai&s;e en|couraged
my growing talent; and had I per&s;evered in this line of
application, I might have acquired &s;ome fame in mathematical
&s;tudies.</P>
<P>After this previous in&s;titution at home, or at a day-&s;chool at Put|ney,
I was delivered at the age of &s;even into the hands of Mr. John
Kirkby, who exerci&s;ed about eighteen months the office of my do|me&s;tic
tutor. His own words, which I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe, in&s;pire
in his favour a &s;entiment of pity and e&s;teem.&mdash;<Q>During my abode
in my native county of Cumberland, in quality of an indigent
curate, I u&s;ed now-and-then in a Summer, when the plea&s;antne&s;s
of the &s;ea&s;on invited, to take a &s;olitary walk to the &s;ea-&s;hore, which
lies about two miles from the town where I lived. Here I would
amu&s;e my&s;elf, one while in viewing at large the agreeable pro&s;pect
which &s;urrounded me, and another while (confining my &s;ight to
nearer objects) in admiring the va&s;t variety of beautiful &s;hells, thrown
upon the beach; &s;ome of the choice&s;t of which I always picked up,
to divert my little ones upon my return. One time among the
re&s;t, taking &s;uch a journey in my head, I &s;at down upon the de|clivity
of the beach with my face to the &s;ea, which was now come
up within a few yards of my feet; when immediately the &s;ad
thoughts of the wretched condition of my family, and the un|&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s
of all endeavours to amend it, came crowding into
<PB N="21" REF="46">
my mind, which drove me into a deep melancholy, and ever and
anon forced tears from my eyes.</Q> Di&s;tre&s;s at la&s;t forced him to
leave the country. His learning and virtue introduced him to my
father; and at Putney he might have found at lea&s;t a temporary
&s;helter, had not an act of indi&s;cretion again driven him into the
world. One day reading prayers in the pari&s;h church, he mo&s;t un|luckily
forgot the name of King George: his patron, a loyal &s;ub|ject,
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with &s;ome reluctance, and a decent reward; and
<HI>how</HI> the poor man ended his days I have never been able to learn.
Mr. John Kirkby is the author of two &s;mall volumes; the Life of
Automathes (London, 1745), and an Engli&s;h and Latin Grammar
(London, 1746); which, as a te&s;timony of gratitude, he dedicated
(November 5th, 1745) to my father. The books are before me:
from them the pupil may judge the preceptor; and, upon the whole,
his judgment will not be unfavourable. The grammar is executed
with accuracy and &s;kill, and I know not whether any better exi&s;ted
at the time in our language: but the life of Automathes a&s;pires to
the honours of a philo&s;ophical fiction. It is the &s;tory of a youth, the
&s;on of a &s;hipwrecked exile, who lives alone on a de&s;ert i&s;land from
infancy to the age of manhood. A hind is his nur&s;e; he inherits a
cottage, with many u&s;eful and curious in&s;truments; &s;ome ideas re|main
of the education of his two fir&s;t years; &s;ome arts are bor|rowed
from the beavers of a neighbouring lake; &s;ome truths are re|vealed
in &s;upernatural vi&s;ions. With the&s;e helps, and his own in|du&s;try,
Automathes becomes a &s;elf-taught thought &s;peechle&s;s philo&s;o|pher,
who had inve&s;tigated with &s;ucce&s;s his own mind, the natural
world, the ab&s;tract &s;ciences, and the great principles of morality and
religion. The author is not entitled to the merit of invention, &s;ince
he has blended the Engli&s;h &s;tory of Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe with the Ara|bian
romance of Hai Ebn Yokhdan, which he might have read in the
Latin ver&s;ion of Pocock. In the Automathes I cannot prai&s;e either
the depth of thought or elegance of &s;tyle; but the book is not devoid
<PB N="22" REF="47">
of entertainment or in&s;truction; and among &s;everal intere&s;ting pa&s;|&s;ages,
I would &s;elect the di&s;covery of fire, which produces by acci|dental
mi&s;chief the di&s;covery of con&s;cience. A man who had though
&s;o much on the &s;ubjects of language and education was &s;urely no or|dinary
preceptor: my childi&s;h years, and his ha&s;ty departure, pre|vented
me from enjoying the full benefit of his le&s;&s;ons; but they en|larged
my knowledge of arithmetic, and left me a clear impre&s;&s;ion of
the Engli&s;h and Latin rudiments.</P>
<P>In my ninth year (January 1746), in a lucid interval of compa|rative
health, my father adopted the convenient and cu&s;tomary mode
of Engli&s;h education; and I was &s;ent to King&s;ton upon Thames, to
a &s;chool of about &s;eventy boys, which was kept by Dr. Woodde&s;on
and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants. Every time I have &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed over Putney Com|mon,
I have always noticed the &s;pot where my mother, as we drove
along in the coach, admoni&s;hed me that I was now going into the
world, and mu&s;t learn to think and act for my&s;elf. The expre&s;&s;ion
may appear ludicrous; yet there is not, in the cour&s;e of life, a more
remarkable change than the removal of a child from the luxury and
freedom of a wealthy hou&s;e, to the frugal diet and &s;trict &s;ubordina|tion
of a &s;chool; from the tenderne&s;s of parents, and the ob&s;equiou&s;|ne&s;s
of &s;ervants, to the rude familiarity of his equals, the in&s;olent ty|ranny
of his &s;eniors, and the rod, perhaps, of a cruel and capricious
pedagogue. Such hard&s;hips may &s;teel the mind and body again&s;t the
injuries of fortune; but my timid re&s;erve was a&s;toni&s;hed by the
crowd and tumult of the &s;chool; the want of &s;trength and activity
di&s;qualified me for the &s;ports of the play-field; nor have I forgotten
how often in the year forty-&s;ix I was reviled and buffetted for the
&s;ins of my Tory ance&s;tors. By the common methods of di&s;cipline,
at the expence of many tears and &s;ome blood, I purcha&s;ed the
knowledge of the Latin &s;yntax: and not long &s;ince I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of the dirty volumes of Phaedrus and Cornelius Nepos, which I pain|fully
con&s;trued and darkly under&s;tood. The choice of the&s;e authors
<PB N="23" REF="48">
is not injudicious. The <HI>lives</HI> of Cornelius Nepos, the friend of At|ticus
and Cicero, are compo&s;ed in the &s;tyle of the pure&s;t age: his
&s;implicity is elegant, his brevity copious: he exhibits a &s;eries of men
and manners; and with &s;uch illu&s;trations, as every pedant is not in|deed
qualified to give, this cla&s;&s;ic biographer may initiate a young
&s;tudent in the hi&s;tory of Greece and Rome. The u&s;e of fables or
apologues has been approved in every age from antient India to mo|dern
Europe. They convey in familiar images the truths of morality
and prudence; and the mo&s;t childi&s;h under&s;tanding (I advert to the
&s;cruples of Rou&s;&s;eau) will not &s;uppo&s;e either that bea&s;ts <HI>do</HI> &s;peak, or
that men <HI>may</HI> lie. A fable repre&s;ents the genuine characters of ani|mals;
and &s;kilful ma&s;ter might extract from Pliny and Buffon &s;ome
plea&s;ing le&s;&s;ons of natural hi&s;tory, a &s;cience well adapted to the ta&s;te
and capacity of children. The Latinity of Phaedrus is not exempt
from an alloy of the &s;ilver age; but his manner is conci&s;e, ter&s;e, and
&s;ententious: the Thracian &s;lave di&s;creetly breathes the &s;pirit of a free|man;
and when the text is found, the &s;tyle is per&s;picuous. But his
fables, after a long oblivion, were fir&s;t publi&s;hed by Peter Pithou,
from a corrupt manu&s;cript. The labours of fifty editors confe&s;s the
defects of the copy, as well as the value of the original; and the
&s;chool-boy may have been whipt for mi&s;apprehending a pa&s;&s;age,
which Bentley could not re&s;tore, and which Burman could not
explain.</P>
<P>My &s;tudies were too frequently interrupted by &s;ickne&s;s; and after
a real or nominal re&s;idence at King&s;ton-&s;chool of near two years, I
was finally recalled (December 1747) by my mother's death, which
was occa&s;ioned, in her thirty-eighth year, by the con&s;equences of
her la&s;t labour. I was too young to feel the importance of my lo&s;s;
and the image of her per&s;on and conver&s;ation is faintly imprinted in
my memory. The affectionate heart of my aunt, Catherine Porten,
bewailed a &s;i&s;ter and a friend; but my poor father was incon&s;olable,
and the tran&s;port of grief &s;eemed to threaten his life or his rea&s;on.
<PB N="24" REF="49">
I can never forget the &s;eene of our fir&s;t interview, &s;ome weeks after
the fatal event; the awful &s;ilence, the room hung with black, the
mid-day tapers, his &s;ighs and tears; his prai&s;es of my mother, a &s;aint
in heaven; his &s;olemn adjuration that I would cheri&s;h her memory
and imitate her virtues; and the fervor with which he ki&s;&s;ed and
ble&s;&s;ed me as the &s;ole &s;urviving pledge of their loves. The &s;torm of
pa&s;&s;ion in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ub&s;ided into calmer melancholy. At a convivial
meeting of his friends, Mr. Gibbon might affect or enjoy a gleam of
cheerfulne&s;s; but his plan of happine&s;s was for ever de&s;troyed: and
after the lo&s;s of his companion he was left alone in a world, of which
the bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ures were to him irk&s;ome or in&s;ipid. After
&s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful trials he renounced the tumult of London and the
ho&s;pitality of Putney, and buried him&s;elf in the rural or rather ru&s;tic
&s;olitude of Buriton; from which, during &s;everal years, he &s;eldom
emerged.</P>
<P>As far back as I can remember, the hou&s;e, near Putney-bridge and
church-yard, of my maternal grandfather appears in the light of my
prper and native home. It was there that I was allowed to &s;pend
the greate&s;t part of my time, in &s;ickne&s;s or in health, during my
&s;chool vacations and my parents' re&s;idence in London, and finally
after my mother's death. Three months after that event, in the
&s;pring of 1748, the commercial ruin of her father, Mr. James Por|ten,
was accompli&s;hed and declared. He &s;uddenly ab&s;conded: but as
his effects were not &s;old, nor the hou&s;e evacuated, till the Chri&s;tmas
following, I enjoyed during the whole year the &s;ociety of my aunt,
without much con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her impending fate. I feel a melan|choly
plea&s;ure in repeating my obligations to that excellent woman,
Mrs. Catherine Porten, the true mother of my mind as well as of
my health. Her natural good &s;en&s;e was improved by the peru&s;al of
the be&s;t books in the Engli&s;h language; and if her rea&s;on was &s;ome|times
clouded by prejudice, her &s;entiments were never di&s;gui&s;ed by
hypocri&s;y or affectation. Her indulgent tenderne&s;s, the frankne&s;s of
<PB N="25" REF="50">
her temper, and my innate ri&s;ing curio&s;ity, &s;oon removed all di&s;tance
between us: like friends of an equal age, we freely conver&s;ed on
every topic, familiar or ab&s;tru&s;e; and it was her delight and reward
to ob&s;erve the fir&s;t &s;hoots of my young ideas. Pain and languor
were often &s;oothed by the voice of in&s;truction and amu&s;ement; and
to her kind le&s;&s;ons I a&s;cribe my early and invincible love of read|ing,
which I would not exchange for the trea&s;ures of India. I
&s;hould perhaps be a&s;toni&s;hed, were it po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the date, at
which a favourite tale was engraved, by frequent repetition, in my
memory: the Cavern of the Winds; the Palace of Felicity; and the
fatal moment, at the end of three months or centuries, when Prince
Adolphus is overtaken by Time, who had worn out &s;o many pair of
wings in the pur&s;uit. Before I left King&s;ton &s;chool I was well ac|quainted
with Pope's Homer and the Arabian Nights Entertainments,
two books which will always plea&s;e by the moving picture of human
manners and &s;pecious miracles: nor was I then capable of di&s;cerning
that Pope's tran&s;lation is a portrait endowed with every merit, except|ing
that of likene&s;s to the original. The ver&s;es of Pope accu&s;tomed my
ear to the &s;ound of poetic harmony: in the death of Hector, and the
&s;hipwreck of Uly&s;&s;es, I ta&s;ted the new emotions of terror and pity; and
&s;eriou&s;ly di&s;puted with my aunt on the vices and virtues of the heroes
of the Trojan war. From Pope's Homer to Dryden's Virgil was an
ea&s;y tran&s;ition; but I know not how, from &s;ome fault in the author,
the tran&s;lator, or the reader, the pious Aeneas did not &s;o forcibly
&s;eize on my imagination; and I derived more plea&s;ure from Ovid's
Metamorpho&s;es, e&s;pecially in the fall of Phaeton, and the &s;peeches of
Ajax and Uly&s;&s;es. My grandfather's flight unlocked the door of a
tolerable library; and I turned over many Engli&s;h pages of poetry
and romance, of hi&s;tory and travels. Where a title attracted my eye,
without fear or awe I &s;natched the volume from the &s;helf; and Mrs.
Porten, who indulged her&s;elf in moral and religious &s;peculations,
was more prone to encourage than to check a curio&s;ity above the
<PB N="26" REF="51">
&s;trength of a boy. This year (1748), the twelfth of my age, I &s;hall
note as the mo&s;t propitious to the growth of my intellectual &s;tatue.</P>
<P>The relies of my grandfather's fortune afforded a bare annuity for
his own maintenance; and his daughter, my worthy aunt, who had
already pa&s;&s;ed her fortieth year, was left de&s;titute. Her noble &s;pirit
&s;corned a life of obligation and dependence; and after revolving &s;e|veral
&s;chemes, &s;he preferred the humble indu&s;try of keeping a board|ing-hou&s;e
for We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid in the family, that &s;he was principally induced to this undertaking by her affection for her nephew, who&s;e weak con&s;titution required her con&s;tant and unre|mitted attention. S.</NOTE>, where &s;he laboriou&s;ly earned a
competence for her old age. This &s;ingular opportunity of blending
the advantages of private and public education decided my father.
After the Chri&s;tmas holidays in January 1749, I accompanied Mrs.
Porten to her new hou&s;e in College-&s;treet; and was immediately en|tered
in the &s;chool, of which Dr. John Nicoll was at that time head|ma&s;ter.
At fir&s;t I was alone: but my aunt's re&s;olution was prai&s;ed;
her character was e&s;teemed; her friends were numerous and active:
in the cour&s;e of &s;ome years &s;he became the mother of forty or fifty
boys, for the mo&s;t part of family and fortune; and as her primitive
habitation was too narrow, &s;he built and occupied a &s;pacious man|&s;ion
in Dean's Yard. I &s;hall always be ready to join in the common
opinion, that our public &s;chools, which have produced &s;o many emi|nent
characters, are the be&s;t adapted to the genius and con&s;titution
of the Engli&s;h people. A boy of &s;pirit may acquire a previous and
practical experience of the world; and his playfellows may be the
future friends of his heart or his intere&s;t. In a free intercour&s;e with
his equals, the habits of truth, fortitude, and prudence will in&s;en&s;ibly
be matured. Birth and riches are mea&s;ured by the &s;tandard of per|&s;onal
merit; and the mimic &s;cene of a rebellion has di&s;played, in
their true colours, the mini&s;ters and patriots of the ri&s;ing generation.
Our &s;eminaries of learning do not exactly corre&s;pond with the
<PB N="27" REF="52">
precept of a Spartan king, <Q>that the child &s;hould be in&s;tructed in the
arts, which will be u&s;eful to the man;</Q> &s;ince a fini&s;hed &s;cholar may
emerge from the head of We&s;tmin&s;ter or Eton, in total ignorance of
the bu&s;ine&s;s and conver&s;ation of Engli&s;h gentlemen in the latter end
of the eighteenth century. But the&s;e &s;chools may a&s;&s;ume the merit
of teaching all that they pretend to teach, the Latin and Greek lan|guages:
they depo&s;it in the hands of a di&s;ciple the keys of two valu|able
che&s;ts; nor can he complain, if they are afterwards lo&s;t or ne|glected
by his own fault. The nece&s;&s;ity of leading in equal ranks &s;o
many unequal powers of capacity and application, will prolong to
eight or ten years the juvenile &s;tudies, which might be di&s;patched in
half that time by the &s;kilful ma&s;ter of a &s;ingle pupil. Yet even the
repetition of exerci&s;e and di&s;cipline contributes to fix in a vacant
mind the verbal &s;cience of grammar and pro&s;ody: and the private or
voluntary &s;tudent, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the cla&s;&s;ics, may
offend, by a fal&s;e quantity, the &s;crupulous ear of a well-flogged critic.
For my&s;elf, I mu&s;t be content with a very &s;mall &s;hare of the civil and
literary fruits of a public &s;chool. In the &s;pace of two years (1749,
1750), interrupted by danger and debility, I painfully climbed into
the third form; and my riper age was left to acquire the beauties of
the Latin, and the rudiments of the Greek tongue. In&s;tead of auda|ciou&s;ly
mingling in the &s;ports, the quarrels, and the connections of
our little world, I was &s;till cheri&s;hed at home under the maternal
wing of my aunt; and my removal from We&s;tmin&s;ter long preceded
the approach of manhood.</P>
<P>The violence and variety of my complaints, which had excu&s;ed
my frequent ab&s;ence from We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool, at length engaged
Mrs. Porten, with the advice of phy&s;icians, to conduct me to Bath:
at the end of the Michaelmas vacation (1750) &s;he quitted me with
reluctance, and I remained &s;everal months under the care of a tru&s;ty
maid-&s;ervant. A &s;trange nervous affection, which alternately con|tracted
my legs, and produced, without any vi&s;ible &s;ymptoms, the
<PB N="28" REF="53">
mo&s;t excruciating pain, was ineffectually oppo&s;ed by the various
methods of bathing and pumping. From Bath I was tran&s;ported to
Winche&s;ter, to the hou&s;e of a phy&s;ician; and after the failure of his
medical &s;kill, we had again recour&s;e to the virtues of the Bath waters.
During the intervals of the&s;e fits, I moved with my father to Buriton
and Putney; and a &s;hort un&s;ucce&s;sful trial was attempted to renew
my attendance at We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool. But my infirmities could not
be reconciled with the hours and di&s;cipline of a public &s;eminary; and
in&s;tead of a dome&s;tic tutor, who might have watched the favourable
moments, and gently advanced the progre&s;s of my learning, my
father was too ea&s;ily content with &s;uch occa&s;ional teachers, as the dif|ferent
places of my re&s;idence could &s;upply. I was never forced, and
&s;eldom was I per&s;uaded, to admit the&s;e le&s;&s;ons: yet I read with a
clergyman at Bath &s;ome odes of Horace, and &s;everal epi&s;odes of
Virgil, which gave me an imperfect and tran&s;ient enjoyment of the
Latin poets. It might now be apprehended that I &s;hould continue
for life an illiterate cripple: but, as I approached my &s;ixteenth year,
Nature di&s;played in my favour her my&s;terious energies: my con&s;ti|tution
was fortified and fixed; and my di&s;orders, in&s;tead of growing
with my growth and &s;trengthening with my &s;trength, mo&s;t wonder|fully
vani&s;hed. I have never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or abu&s;ed the in&s;olence of
health: but &s;ince that time few per&s;ons have been more exempt from
real or imaginary ills; and, till I am admoni&s;hed by the gout, the
reader will no more be troubled with the hi&s;tory of my bodily com|plaints.
My unexpected recovery again encouraged the hope of my
education; and I was placed at E&s;her, in Surry, in the hou&s;e of the
Reverend Mr. Philip Francis, in a plea&s;ant &s;pot, which promi&s;ed to
unite the various benefits of air, exerci&s;e, and &s;tudy (January 1752).
The tran&s;lator of Horace might have taught me to reli&s;h the Latin
poets, had not my friends di&s;covered in a few weeks, that he preferred
the plea&s;ures of London, to the in&s;truction of his pupils. My father's
perplexity at this time, rather than his prudence, was urged to em|brace
<PB N="29" REF="54">
a &s;ingular and de&s;perate mea&s;ure. Without preparation or de|lay
he carried me to Oxford; and I was matriculated in the univer|&s;ity
as a gentleman commoner of Magdalen college, before I had ac|compli&s;hed
the fifteenth year of my age (April 3, 1752).</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity, which had been implanted in my infant mind, was
&s;till alive and active; but my rea&s;on was not &s;ufficiently informed to
under&s;tand the value, or to lament the lo&s;s, of three precious years
from my entrance at We&s;tmin&s;ter to my admi&s;&s;ion at Oxford. In|&s;tead
of repining at my long and frequent confinement to the cham|ber
or the couch, I &s;ecretly rejoiced in tho&s;e infirmities, which deli|vered
me from the exerci&s;es of the &s;chool, and the &s;ociety of my
equals. As often as I was tolerably exempt from danger and pain,
reading, free de&s;ultory reading, was the employment and comfort of
my &s;olitary hours. At We&s;tmin&s;ter, my aunt &s;ought only to amu&s;e
and indulge me; in my &s;tations at Bath and Winche&s;ter, at Buriton
and Putney, a fal&s;e compa&s;&s;ion re&s;pected my &s;ufferings; and I was
allowed, without controul or advice, to gratify the wanderings of an
unripe ta&s;te. My indi&s;criminate appetite &s;ub&s;ided by degrees in the
<HI>hi&s;toric</HI> line: and &s;ince philo&s;ophy has exploded all innate ideas
and natural propen&s;ities, I mu&s;t a&s;cribe this choice to the a&s;&s;idu|ous
peru&s;al of the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, as the octavo volumes &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively
appeared. This unequal work, and a treati&s;e of Hearne, the
<HI>Ductor hi&s;toricus,</HI> referred and introduced me to the Greek and Roman
hi&s;torians, to as many at lea&s;t as were acce&s;&s;ible to an Engli&s;h reader.
All that I could find were greedily devoured, from Littlebury's lame
Herodotus, and Spelman's valuable Xenophon, to the pompous
folios of Gordon's Tacitus, and a ragged Procopius of the beginning
of the la&s;t century. The cheap acqui&s;ition of &s;o much knowledge
confirmed my di&s;like to the &s;tudy of languages; and I argued with
Mrs. Porten, that, were I ma&s;ter of Greek and Latin, I mu&s;t inter|pret
to my&s;elf in Engli&s;h the thoughts of the original, and that &s;uch
extemporary ver&s;ions mu&s;t be inferior to the elaborate tran&s;lations of
<PB N="30" REF="55">
profe&s;&s;ed &s;cholars; a &s;illy &s;ophi&s;m, which could not ea&s;ily be con|futed
by a per&s;on ignorant of any other language than her own.
From the ancient I leaped to the modern world: many crude lumps
of Speed, Rapin, Mezeray, Davila, Machiavel, Father Paul, Bower,
&amp;c. I devoured like &s;o many novels; and I &s;wallowed with the &s;ame
voracious appetite the de&s;criptions of India and China, of Mexico
and Peru.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t introduction to the hi&s;toric &s;cenes, which have &s;ince en|gaged
&s;o many years of my life, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to an accident. In
the &s;ummer of 1751, I accompanied my father on a vi&s;it to Mr.
Hoare's, in Wilt&s;hire; but I was le&s;s delighted with the beauties of
Stourhead, than with di&s;covering in the library a common book,
the Continuation of Echard's Roman Hi&s;tory, which is indeed exe|cuted
with more &s;kill and ta&s;te than the previous work. To me
the reigns of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Con&s;tantine were ab&s;olutely new;
and I was immer&s;ed in the pa&s;&s;age of the Goths over the Da|nube,
when the &s;ummons of the dinner-bell reluctantly dragged me
from my intellectual fea&s;t. This tran&s;ient glance &s;erved rather to
irritate than to appea&s;e my curio&s;ity; and as &s;oon as I returned to
Bath I procured the &s;econd and third volumes of Howel's Hi&s;tory of
the World, which exhibit the Byzantine period on a larger &s;cale.
Mahomet and his Saracens &s;oon fixed my attention; and &s;ome in&s;tinct
of critici&s;m directed me to the genuine &s;ources. Simon Ockley, an
original in every &s;en&s;e, fir&s;t opened my eyes; and I was led from
one book to another, till I had ranged round the circle of Oriental
hi&s;tory. Before I was &s;ixteen, I had exhau&s;ted all that could be
learned in Engli&s;h of the Arabs and Per&s;ians, the Tartars and Turks;
and the &s;ame ardour urged me to gue&s;s at the French of D'Herbelot,
and to con&s;true the barbarous Latin of Pocock's Abulfaragius. Such
vague and multifarious reading could not teach me to think, to write,
or to act; and the only principle, that darted a ray of light into the
indige&s;ted chaos, was an early and rational application to the order
<PB N="31" REF="56">
of time and place. The maps of Cellarius and Wells imprinted in my
mind the picture of ancient geography: from Stranchius I imbibed
the elements of chronology: the Tables of Helvicus and Ander&s;on,
the Annals of U&s;her and Prideaux, di&s;tingui&s;hed the connection of
events, and engraved the multitude of names and dates in a clear and
indelible &s;eries. But in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t ages I overleaped
the bounds of mode&s;ty and u&s;e. In my childi&s;h balance I pre&s;umed
to weigh the &s;y&s;tems of Scaliger and Petavius, of Mar&s;ham and New|ton,
which I could &s;eldom &s;tudy in the originals; and my &s;leep has
been di&s;turbed by the difficulty of reconciling the Septuagint with the
Hebrew computation. I arrived at Oxford with a &s;tock of erudition,
that might have puzzled a doctor, and a degree of ignorance, of which
a &s;chool-boy would have been a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this fir&s;t period of my life, I am tempted to
enter a prote&s;t again&s;t the trite and lavi&s;h prai&s;e of the happine&s;s of
our boyi&s;h years, which is echoed with &s;o much affectation in the
world. That happine&s;s I have never known, that time I have never
regretted; and were my poor aunt &s;till alive, &s;he would bear te&s;ti|mony
to the early and con&s;tant uniformity of my &s;entiments. It will
indeed be replied, that <HI>I</HI> am not a competent judge; that plea&s;ure is
incompatible with pain; that joy is excluded from &s;ickne&s;s; and that
the felicity of a &s;chool-boy con&s;i&s;ts in the perpetual motion of
thoughtle&s;s and playful agility, in which I was never qualified to
excel. My name, it is mo&s;t true, could never be enrolled among
the &s;prightly race, the idle progeny of Eton or We&s;tmin&s;ter,
<Q><L>"Who foremo&s;t may delight to cleave,</L>
<L>"With pliant arm, the gla&s;&s;y wave,</L>
<L>"Or urge the flying ball."</L></Q>
The poet may gaily de&s;cribe the &s;hort hours of recreation; but he
forgets the daily tedious labours of the &s;chool, which is approached
each morning with anxious and reluctant &s;teps.</P>

A traveller, who vi&s;its Oxford or Cambridge, is &s;urpri&s;ed and edified
by the apparent order and tranquillity that prevail in the &s;eats of the
Engli&s;h mu&s;es. In the mo&s;t celebrated univer&s;ities of Holland, Ger|many,
and Italy, the &s;tudents, who &s;warm from different countries,
are loo&s;ely di&s;per&s;ed in private lodgings at the hou&s;es of the burghers:
they dre&s;s according to their fancy and fortune; and in the intempe|rate
quarrels of youth and wine, their <HI>&s;words,</HI> though le&s;s frequently
than of old, are &s;ometimes &s;tained with each other's blood. The u&s;e
of arms is bani&s;hed from our Engli&s;h univer&s;ities; the uniform habit
of the academics, the &s;quare cap, and black gown, is adapted to the
civil and even clerical profe&s;&s;ion; and from the doctor in divinity to
the under-graduate, the degrees of learning and age are externally
di&s;tingui&s;hed. In&s;tead of being &s;cattered in a town, the &s;tudents of
Oxford and Cambridge are united in colleges; their maintenance is
provided at their own expence, or that of the founders; and the
&s;tated hours of the hall and chapel repre&s;ent the di&s;cipline of a regu|lar,
and, as it were, a religious community. The eyes of the travel|ler
are attracted by the &s;ize or beauty of the public edifices; and the
principal colleges appear to be &s;o many palaces, which a liberal nation
has erected and endowed for the habitation of &s;cience. My own
introduction to the univer&s;ity of Oxford forms a new aera in my life;
and at the di&s;tance of forty years I &s;till remember my fir&s;t emotions
of &s;urpri&s;e and &s;atisfaction. In my fifteenth year I felt my&s;elf &s;ud|denly
rai&s;ed from a boy to a man: the per&s;ons, whom I re&s;pected as my
&s;uperiors in age and academical rank, entertained me with every mark
of attention and civility; and my vanity was flattered by the velvet
cap and &s;ilk gown, which di&s;tingui&s;h a gentleman commoner from a
plebeian &s;tudent. A decent allowance, more money than a &s;chool-boy
had ever &s;een, was at my own di&s;po&s;al; and I might command,
among the trade&s;men of Oxford, an indefinite and dangerous lati|tude
of credit. A key was delivered into my hands, which gave me
<PB N="33" REF="58">
the free u&s;e of a numerous and learned library: my apartment con|&s;i&s;ted
of three elegant and well-furni&s;hed rooms in the new building,
a &s;tately pile, of Magdalen College; and the adjacent walks, had
they been frequented by Plato's di&s;ciples, might have been compared
to the Attic &s;hade on the banks of the Ili&s;&s;us. Such was the fair
pro&s;pect of my entrance (April 3, 1752) into the univer&s;ity of
Oxford.</P>
<P>A venerable prelate, who&s;e ta&s;te and erudition mu&s;t reflect honour
on the &s;ociety in which they were formed, has drawn a very intere&s;t|ing
picture of his academical life.&mdash;<Q>I was educated (&s;ays Bi&s;hop
Lowth) in the UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. I enjoyed all the ad|vantages,
both public and private, which that famous &s;eat of learn|ing
&s;o largely affords. I &s;pent many years in that illu&s;trious &s;o|ciety,
in a well-regulated cour&s;e of u&s;eful di&s;cipline and &s;tudies, and
in the agreeable and improving commerce of gentlemen and of
&s;cholars; in a &s;ociety where emulation without envy, ambition
without jealou&s;y, contention without animo&s;ity, incited indu&s;try,
and awakened genius; where a liberal pur&s;uit of knowledge, and
a genuine freedom of thought, was rai&s;ed, encouraged, and pu&s;hed
forward by example, by commendation, and by authority. I
breathed the &s;ame atmo&s;phere that the HOOKERS, the CHILLING|WORTHS,
and the LOCKES had breathed before; who&s;e benevo|lence
and humanity were as exten&s;ive as their va&s;t genius and
comprehen&s;ive knowledge; who always treated their adver&s;aries
with civility and re&s;pect; who made candour, moderation, and
liberal judgment as much the rule and law as the &s;ubject of their
di&s;cour&s;e. And do you reproach me with my education in this
place, and with my relation to this mo&s;t re&s;pectable body, which
I &s;hall always e&s;teem my greate&s;t advantage and my highe&s;t ho|nour?</Q> I tran&s;cribe with plea&s;ure this eloquent pa&s;&s;age, without
examining what benefits or what rewards were derived by Hooker,
or Chillingworth, or Locke, from their academical in&s;titution; without
<PB N="34" REF="59">
inquiring, whether in this angry controver&s;y the &s;pirit of Lowth him|&s;elf
is purified from the intolerant zeal, which Warburton had a&s;cribed
to the genius of the place. It may indeed be ob&s;erved, that the at|mo&s;phere
of Oxford did not agree with Mr. Locke's con&s;titution, and
that the philo&s;opher ju&s;tly de&s;pi&s;ed the academical bigots, who ex|pelled
his per&s;on and condemned his principles. The expre&s;&s;ion of
gratitude is a virtue and a plea&s;ure: a liberal mind will delight to
cheri&s;h and celebrate the memory of its parents; and the teachers of
&s;cience are the parents of the mind. I applaud the filial piety, which
it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to imitate; &s;ince I mu&s;t not confe&s;s an imagi|nary
debt, to a&s;&s;ume the merit of a ju&s;t or generous retribution. To
the univer&s;ity of Oxford <HI>I</HI> acknowledge no obligation; and &s;he will
as cheerfully renounce me for a &s;on, as I am willing to di&s;claim her
for a mother. I &s;pent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they
proved the fourteen months the mo&s;t idle and unprofitable of my
whole life: the reader will pronounce between the &s;chool and the
&s;cholar; but I cannot affect to believe that Nature had di&s;qualified me
for all literary pur&s;uits. The &s;pecious and ready excu&s;e of my ten|der
age, imperfect preparation, and ha&s;ty departure, may doubtle&s;s
be alleged; nor do I wi&s;h to defraud &s;uch excu&s;es of their proper
weight. Yet in my &s;ixteenth year I was not devoid of capacity or
application; even my childi&s;h reading had di&s;played an early though
blind propen&s;ity for books; and the &s;hallow flood might have been
taught to flow in a deep channel and a clear &s;tream. In the di&s;ci|pline
of a well-con&s;tituted academy, under the guidance of &s;kilful
and vigilant profe&s;&s;ors, I &s;hould gradually have ri&s;en from tran&s;|lations
to originals, from the Latin to the Greek cla&s;&s;ics, from
dead languages to living &s;cience: my hours would have been oc|cupied
by u&s;eful and agreeable &s;tudies, the wanderings of fancy
would have been re&s;trained, and I &s;hould have e&s;caped the tempta|tions
of idlene&s;s, which finally precipitated my departure from
Oxford.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="60">
Perhaps in a &s;eparate annotation I may coolly examine the fabu|lous
and real antiquities of our &s;i&s;ter univer&s;ities, a que&s;tion which
has kindled &s;uch fierce and fooli&s;h di&s;putes among their fanatic &s;ons.
In the mean while it will be acknolwedged, that the&s;e venerable
bodies are &s;ufficiently old to partake of all the prejudices and infirmi|ties
of age. The &s;chools of Oxford and Cambridge were founded in
a dark age of fal&s;e and barbarous &s;cience; and they are &s;till tainted
with the vices of their origin. Their primitive di&s;cipline was adapted
to the education of prie&s;ts and monks; and the government &s;till re|mains
in the hands of the clergy, an order of men who&s;e manners
are remote from the pre&s;ent world, and who&s;e eyes are dazzled by
the light of philo&s;ophy. The legal incorporation of the&s;e &s;ocieties
by the charters of popes and kings had given them a monopoly of
the public in&s;truction; and the &s;pirit of monopoli&s;ts is narrow,
lazy, and oppre&s;&s;ive: their work is more co&s;tly and le&s;s productive
than that of independent arti&s;ts; and the new improvements &s;o
eagerly gra&s;ped by the competition of freedom, are admitted with
&s;low and &s;ullen reluctance in tho&s;e proud corporations, above the fear
of a rival, and below the confe&s;&s;ion of an error. We may &s;carcely
hope that any reformation will be a voluntary act; and &s;o deeply are
they rooted in law and prejudice, that even the omnipotence of par|liament
would &s;hrink from an inquiry into the &s;tate and abu&s;es of
the two univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of academical degrees, as old as the thirteenth century, is
vi&s;ibly borrowed from the mechanic corporations; in which an ap|prentice,
after &s;erving his time, obtains a te&s;timonial of his &s;kill, and
a licence to practi&s;e his trade and my&s;tery. It is not my de&s;ign to de|preciate
tho&s;e honours, which could never gratify or di&s;appoint my
ambition; and I &s;hould applaud the in&s;titution, if the degrees of ba|chelor
or licentiate were be&s;towed as the reward of manly and &s;uc|ce&s;sful
&s;tudy: if the name and rank of doctor or ma&s;ter were &s;trictly
<PB N="36" REF="61">
re&s;erved for the profe&s;&s;ors of &s;cience, who have approved their title
to the public e&s;teem.</P>
<P>In all the univer&s;ities of Europe, excepting our own, the languages
and &s;ciences and di&s;tributed among a numerous li&s;t of effective pro|fe&s;&s;ors:
the &s;tudents, according to their ta&s;te, their calling, and their
diligence, apply them&s;elves to the proper ma&s;ters; and in the annual
repetition of public and private lectures, the&s;e ma&s;ters are a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly
employed. Our curio&s;ity may inquire what number of profe&s;&s;ors has
been in&s;tituted at Oxford? (for I &s;hall now confine my&s;elf to my own
univer&s;ity;) by whom are they appointed, and what may be the
probable chances of merit or incapacity? how many are &s;tationed to
the three faculties, and how many are left for the liberal arts? what
is the form, and what the &s;ub&s;tance, of their le&s;&s;ons? But all the&s;e
que&s;tions are &s;ilenced by one &s;hort and &s;ingular an&s;wer, <Q>That in
the univer&s;ity of Oxford, the greater part of the public profe&s;&s;ors
have for the&s;e many years given up altogether even the pretence
of teaching.</Q> Incredible as the fact may appear, I mu&s;t re&s;t my
belief on the po&s;itive and impartial evidence of a ma&s;ter of moral and
political wi&s;dom, who had him&s;elf re&s;ided at Oxford. Dr. Adam
Smith a&s;&s;igns as the cau&s;e of their indolence, that, in&s;tead of being
paid by voluntary contributions, which would urge them to increa&s;e
the number, and to de&s;erve the gratitude of their pupils, the Oxford
profe&s;&s;ors are &s;ecure in the enjoyment of a fixed &s;tipend, without the
nece&s;&s;ity of labour, or the apprehen&s;ion of controul. It has indeed
been ob&s;erved, nor is the ob&s;ervation ab&s;urd, that excepting in expe|rimental
&s;ciences, which demand a co&s;tly apparatus and a dexterous
hand, the many valuable treati&s;es, that have been publi&s;hed on every
&s;ubject of learning, may now &s;uper&s;ede the ancient mode of oral in|&s;truction.
Were this principle true in its utmo&s;t latitude, I &s;hould
only infer that the offices and &s;alaries, which are become u&s;ele&s;s, ought
without delay to be aboli&s;hed. But there &s;till remains a material
<PB N="37" REF="62">
difference between a book and a profe&s;&s;or; the hour of the lecture
inforces attendance; attention is fixed by the pre&s;ence, the voice,
and the occa&s;ional que&s;tions of the teacher; the mo&s;t idle will carry
&s;omething away; and the more diligent will compare the in&s;truc|tions,
which they have heard in the &s;chool, with the volumes, which
they peru&s;e in their chamber. The advice of a &s;kilful profe&s;&s;or will
adapt a cour&s;e of reading to every mind and every &s;ituation; his
authority will di&s;cover, admoni&s;h, and at la&s;t cha&s;ti&s;e the negligence
of his di&s;ciples; and his vigilant inquiries will a&s;certain the &s;teps of
their literary progre&s;s. Whatever &s;cience he profe&s;&s;es he may il|lu&s;trate
in a &s;eries of di&s;cour&s;es, compo&s;ed in the lei&s;ure of his
clo&s;et, pronounced on public occa&s;ions, and finally delivered to the
pre&s;s. I ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure, that in the univer&s;ity of Oxford
Dr. Lowth, with equal eloquence and erudition, has executed this
ta&s;k in his incomparable <HI>Praelections</HI> on the Poetry of the Hebrews.</P>
<P>The college of St. Mary Magdalen was founded in the fifteenth
century by Wainfleet bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; and now con&s;i&s;ts
of a pre&s;ident, forty fellows, and a number of inferior &s;tudents.
It is e&s;teemed one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t wealthy of our acade|mical
corporations, which may be compared to the Benedictine
abbeys of catholic countries; and I have loo&s;ely heard that the
e&s;tates belonging to Magdalen College, which are lea&s;ed by tho&s;e
indulgent landlords at &s;mall quit-rents and occa&s;ional &s;ines, might
be rai&s;ed, in the hands of private avarice, to an annual revenue of
nearly thirty thou&s;and pounds. Our colleges are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;chools
of &s;cience, as well as of education; nor is it unrea&s;onable to
expect that a body of literary men, devoted to a life of celibacy,
exempt from the care of their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and amply provided
with books, &s;hould devote their lei&s;ure to the pro&s;ecution of &s;tudy,
and that &s;ome effects of their &s;tudies &s;hould be manife&s;ted to the
world. The &s;helves of their library groan under the weight of the
Benedictine folios, of the editions of the fathers, and the collections
<PB N="38" REF="63">
of the middle ages, which have i&s;&s;ued from the &s;ingle abbey of
St. Germain de Pr&eacute;z at Paris. A compo&s;ition of genius mu&s;t be the
offspring of one mind; but &s;uch works of indu&s;try, as may be di|vided
among many hands, and mu&s;t be continued during many
years, are the peculiar province of a laborious community. If I
inquire into the manufactures of the monks of Magdalen, if I ex|tend
the inquiry to the other colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, a
&s;ilent blu&s;h, or a &s;cornful frown, will be the only reply. The fel|lows
or monks of my time were decent ea&s;y men, who &s;upinely
enjoyed the gifts of the founder: their days were filled by a &s;eries
of uniform employments; the chapel and the hall, the coffee-hou&s;e
and the common room, till they retired, weary and well &s;atisfied,
to a long &s;lumber. From the toil of reading, or thinking, or writing,
they had ab&s;olved their con&s;cience; and the fir&s;t &s;hoots of learning
and ingenuity withered on the ground, without yielding any fruits
to the owners or the public. As a gentleman commoner, I was ad|mitted
to the &s;ociety of the fellows, and fondly expected that &s;ome
que&s;tions of literature would be the amu&s;ing and in&s;tructive topics of
their di&s;cour&s;e. Their conver&s;ation &s;tagnated in a round of college
bu&s;ine&s;s, Tory politics, per&s;onal anecdotes, and private &s;candal: their
dull and deep potations excu&s;ed the bri&s;k intemperance of youth;
and their con&s;titutional toa&s;ts were not expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t lively
loyalty for the hou&s;e of Hanover. A general election was now ap|proaching:
the great Oxford&s;hire conte&s;t already blazed with all the
malevolence of party-zeal. Magdalen College was devoutly attached
to the old intere&s;t! and the names of Wenman and Da&s;hwood were
more frequently pronounced, than tho&s;e of Cicero and Chry&s;o&s;tom.
The example of the &s;enior fellows could not in&s;pire the under-gra|duates
with a liberal &s;pirit or &s;tudious emulation; and I cannot de|&s;cribe,
as I never knew, the di&s;cipline of college. Some duties
may po&s;&s;ibly have been impo&s;ed on the poor &s;cholars, who&s;e am|bition
a&s;pired to the peaceful honours of a fellow&s;hip (<HI>a&s;cribi
<PB N="39" REF="64">
quietis ordinibus&mdash;Deorum</HI>); but no independent members were
admitted below the rank of a gentleman commoner, and our velvet
cap was the cap of liberty. A tradition prevailed that &s;ome of our
predece&s;&s;ors had &s;poken Latin declamations in the hall; but of this
ancient cu&s;tom no ve&s;tige remained: the obvious methods of public
exerci&s;es and examinations were totally unknown; and I have never
heard that either the pre&s;ident or the &s;ociety interfered in the private
oeconomy of the tutors and their pupils.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of the Oxford profe&s;&s;ors, which deprives the youth
of public in&s;truction, is imperfectly &s;upplied by the tutors, as they
are &s;tyled, of the &s;everal colleges. In&s;tead of confining them&s;elves
to a &s;ingle &s;cience, which had &s;atisfied the ambition of Burman or
Bernoulli, they teach, or promi&s;e to teach, either hi&s;tory or ma|thematics,
or ancient literature, or moral philo&s;ophy; and as it is
po&s;&s;ible that they may be defective in all, it is highly probable that
of &s;ome they will be ignorant. They are paid, indeed, by private
contributions; but their appointment depends on the head of the
hou&s;e: their diligence is voluntary, and will con&s;equently be languid,
while the pupils them&s;elves, or their parents, are not indulged in
the liberty of choice or change. The fir&s;t tutor into who&s;e hands
I was re&s;igned appears to have been one of the be&s;t of the tribe:
Dr. Waldegrave was a learned and pious man, of a mild di&s;po&s;ition,
&s;trict morals, and ab&s;temious life, who &s;eldom mingled in the po|litics
or the jollity of the college. But his knowledge of the world
was confined to the univer&s;ity; his learning was of the la&s;t, rather
than of the pre&s;ent age; his temper was indolent; his faculties, which
were not of the fir&s;t rate, had been relaxed by the climate, and he
was &s;atisfied, like his fellows, with the &s;light and &s;uperficial di&s;|charge
of an important tru&s;t. As &s;oon as my tutor had &s;ounded the
in&s;ufficiency of his di&s;ciple in &s;chool-learning, he propo&s;ed that we
&s;hould read every morning from ten to eleven the comedies of Te|rence.
<PB N="40" REF="65">
The &s;um of my improvement in the univer&s;ity of Oxford
is confined to three or four Latin plays; and even the &s;tudy of an
elegant cla&s;&s;ic, which might have been illu&s;trated by a compari&s;on
of ancient and modern theatres, was reduced to a dry and literal in|terpretation
of the author's text. During the fir&s;t weeks I con|&s;tantly
attended the&s;e le&s;&s;ons in my tutor's room; but as they
appeared equally devoid of profit and plea&s;ure, I was once tempted
to try the experiment of a formal apology. The apology was ac|cepted
with a &s;mile. I repeated the offence with le&s;s ceremony;
the excu&s;e was admitted with the &s;ame indulgence: the &s;lighte&s;t
motive of lazine&s;s or indi&s;po&s;ition, the mo&s;t trifling avocation at
home or abroad, was allowed as a worthy impediment; nor did my
tutor appear con&s;cious of my ab&s;ence or neglect. Had the hour of
lecture been con&s;tantly filled, a &s;ingle hour was a &s;mall portion of
my academic lei&s;ure. No plan of &s;tudy was recommended for my
u&s;e; no exerci&s;es were pre&s;cribed for his in&s;pection; and, at the
mo&s;t precious &s;ea&s;on of youth, whole days and weeks were &s;uffered
to elap&s;e without labour or amu&s;ement, without advice or account.
I &s;hould have li&s;tened to the voice of rea&s;on and of my tutor; his
mild behaviour had gained my confidence. I preferred his &s;ociety to
that of the younger &s;tudents; and in our evening walks to the top
of Heddington-hill, we freely conver&s;ed on a variety of &s;ubjects.
Since the days of Pocock and Hyde, Oriental learning has always
been the pride of Oxford, and I once expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to
&s;tudy Arabic. His prudence di&s;couraged this childi&s;h fancy; but
he neglected the fair occa&s;ion of directing the ardour of a curious
mind. During my ab&s;ence in the Summer vacation, Dr. Walde|grave
accepted a college living at Wa&s;hington in Su&s;&s;ex, and on my
return I no longer found him at Oxford. From that time I have
lo&s;t &s;ight of my fir&s;t tutor; but at the end of thirty years (1781)
he was &s;till alive; and the practice of exerci&s;e and temperance had
entitled him to a healthy old age.</P>

The long rece&s;s between the Trinity and Michaelmas terms
empties the colleges of Oxford, as well as the courts of We&s;t|min&s;ter.
I &s;pent, at my father's hou&s;e at Buriton in Hamp&s;hire,
the two months of Augu&s;t and September. It is whim&s;ical enough,
that as &s;oon as I left Magdalen College, my ta&s;te for books began to
revive; but it was the &s;ame blind and boyi&s;h ta&s;te for the pur&s;uit of
exotic hi&s;tory. Unprovided with original learning, unformed in
the habits of thinking, un&s;killed in the arts of compo&s;ition, I re|&s;olved&mdash;to
write a book. The title of this fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay, <HI>the Age of
Se&s;o&s;tris,</HI> was perhaps &s;ugge&s;ted by Voltaire's Age of Lewis XIV.
which was new and popular; but my &s;ole object was to inve&s;tigate
the probable date of the life and reign of the conqueror of A&s;ia. I
was then enamoured of Sir John Mar&s;ham's Canon Chronicus; an
elaborate work, of who&s;e merits and defects I was not yet qualified
to judge. According to his &s;pecious, though narrow plan, I &s;ettled
my hero about the time of Solomon, in the tenth century before the
Chri&s;tian aera. It was therefore incumbent on me, unle&s;s I would
adopt Sir I&s;aac Newton's &s;horter chronology, to remove a formi|dable
objection; and my &s;olution, for a youth of fifteen, is not de|void
of ingenuity. In his ver&s;ion of the Sacred Books, Manetho
the high prie&s;t has identified Setho&s;is, or Se&s;o&s;tris, with the elder
brother of Danaus, who landed in Greece, according to the Parian
Marble, fifteen hundred and ten years before Chri&s;t. But in my
&s;uppo&s;ition the high prie&s;t is guilty of a voluntary error; flattery is
the prolific parent of fal&s;ehood. Manetho's Hi&s;tory of Egypt is
dedicated to Ptolemy Philadelphus, who derived a fabulous or ille|gitimate
pedigree from the Macedonian kings of the race of Her|cules.
Danaus is the ance&s;tor of Hercules; and after the failure
of the elder branch, his de&s;cendants, the Ptolemies, are the &s;ole re|pre&s;entatives
of the royal family, and may claim by inheritance the
kingdom which they hold by conque&s;t. Such were my juvenile
di&s;coveries; at a riper age, I no longer pre&s;ume to connect the
<PB N="42" REF="67">
Greek, the Jewi&s;h, and the Egyptian antiquities, which are lo&s;t in
a di&s;tant cloud. Nor is this the only in&s;tance, in which the belief
and knowledge of the child are &s;uper&s;eded by the more rational
ignorance of the man. During my &s;tay at Buriton, my infant-labour
was diligently pro&s;ecuted, without much interruption from
company or country diver&s;ions; and I already heard the mu&s;ic of
public applau&s;e. The di&s;covery of my own weakne&s;s was the fir&s;t
&s;ymptom of ta&s;te. On my return to Oxford, the Age of Se&s;o&s;tris
was wi&s;ely relinqui&s;hed; but the imperfect &s;heets remained twenty
years at the bottom of a drawer, till, in a general clearance of papers,
(November 1772,) they were committed to the flames.</P>
<P>After the departure of Dr. Waldgrave, I was transferred, with his
other pupils, to his academical heir, who&s;e literary character did not
command the re&s;pect of the college. Dr. *** well remembered that
he had a &s;alary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to per|form.
In&s;tead of guiding the &s;tudies, and watching over the behaviour
of his di&s;ciple, I was never &s;ummoned to attend even the ceremony
of a lecture; and, excepting one voluntary vi&s;it to his rooms, during
the eight months of his titular office, the tutor and pupil lived in the
&s;ame college as &s;trangers to each other. The want of experience,
of advice, and of occupation, &s;oon betrayed me into &s;ome impro|prieties
of conduct, ill-cho&s;en company, late hours, and incon&s;ider|ate
expence. My growing debts might be &s;ecret; but my frequent
ab&s;ence was vi&s;ible and &s;candalous: and a tour to Bath, a vi&s;it into
Buckingham&s;hire, and four excur&s;ions to Lodon in the &s;ame winter,
were co&s;tly and dangerous frolics. They were, indeed, without a
meaning, as without an excu&s;e. The irk&s;omene&s;s of a cloi&s;tered
life repeatedly tempted me to wander; but my chief plea&s;ure was
that of travelling; and I was too young and ba&s;hful to enjoy, like
a Manly Oxonian in Town, the plea&s;ures of London. In all the&s;e
excur&s;ions I eloped from Oxford; I returned to college; in a few
days I eloped again, as if I had been an independent &s;tranger in a
<PB N="43" REF="68">
hired lodging, without once hearing the voice of admonition, with|out
once feeling the hand of control. Yet my time was lo&s;t, my
expences were multiplied, my behaviour abroad was unknown; folly
as well as vice &s;hould have awakened the attention of my &s;uperiors,
and my tender years would have ju&s;tified a more than ordinary de|gree
of re&s;traint and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>It might at lea&s;t be expected, that an eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;chool &s;hould
inculcate the orthodox principles of religion. But our venerable
mother had contrived to unite the oppo&s;ite extremes of bigotry and
indifference: an heretic, or unbeliever, was a mon&s;ter in her eyes;
but &s;he was always, or often, or &s;ometimes, remi&s;s in the &s;piritual
education of her own children. According to the &s;tatutes of the
univer&s;ity, every &s;tudent, before he is matriculated, mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe his
a&s;&s;ent to the thirty-nine articles of the church of England, which are
&s;igned by more than read, and read by more than believe them.
My in&s;ufficient age excu&s;ed me, however, from the immediate per|formance
of this legal ceremony; and the vice-chancellor directed
me to return, as &s;oon as I &s;hould have accompli&s;hed my fifteenth year;
recommending me, in the mean while, to the in&s;truction of my col|lege.
My college forgot to in&s;truct: I forgot to return, and was
my&s;elf forgotten by the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the univer&s;ity. Without
a &s;ingle lecture, either public or private, either chri&s;tian or prote&s;tant,
without any academical &s;ub&s;cription, without any epi&s;copal confirm|ation,
I was left by the dim light of my catechi&s;m to grope my way
to the chapel and communion-table, where I was admitted, without
a que&s;tion, how far, or by what means, I might be qualified to receive
the &s;acrament. Such almo&s;t incredible neglect was productive of the
wor&s;t mi&s;chiefs. From my childhood I had been fond of religious
di&s;putation: my poor aunt has been often puzzled by the my&s;teries
which &s;he &s;trove to believe; nor had the ela&s;tic &s;pring been totally
broken by the weight of the atmo&s;phere of Oxford. The blind acti|vity
of idlene&s;s urged me to advance without armour into the dan|gerous
<PB N="44" REF="69">
mazes of controver&s;y; and at the age of &s;ixteen, I bewildered
my&s;elf in the errors of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of my conver&s;ion may tend to illu&s;trate, at lea&s;t, the
hi&s;tory of my own mind. It was not long &s;ince Dr. Middleton's free
inquiry had &s;ounded an alarm in the theological world: much ink
and much gall had been &s;pilt in the defence of the primitive miracles;
and the two dulle&s;t of their champions were crowned with academic
honours by the univer&s;ity of Oxford. The name of Middleton was
unpopular; and his pro&s;cription very naturally led me to peru&s;e his
writings, and tho&s;e of his antagoni&s;ts. His bold critici&s;m, which ap|proaches
the precipice of infidelity, produced on my mind a &s;ingular
effect; and had I per&s;evered in the communion of Rome, I &s;hould
now apply to my own fortune the prediction of the Sybil,
<Q><L>&mdash;Via prima &s;alutis,</L>
<L>Quod minim&eacute; reris, Grai&acirc;, pandetur ab urbe.</L></Q>
The elegance of &s;tyle and freedom of argument were repelled by a
&s;hield of prejudice. I &s;till revered the character, or rather the names,
of the &s;aints and fathers whom Dr. Middleton expo&s;es; nor could he
de&s;troy my implicit belief, that the gift of miraculous powers was
continued in the church, during the fir&s;t four or five centuries of
chri&s;tianity. But I was unable to re&s;i&s;t the weight of hi&s;torical evi|dence,
that within the &s;ame period mo&s;t of the leading doctrines of
popery were already introduced in theory and practice: nor was my
conclu&s;ion ab&s;urd, that miracles are the te&s;t of truth, and that the
church mu&s;t be orthodox and pure, which was &s;o often approved by
the vi&s;ible interpo&s;ition of the Deity. The marvellous tales which
are &s;o boldly atte&s;ted by the Ba&s;ils and Chry&s;o&s;toms, the Au&s;tins and
Jeroms, compelled me to embrace the &s;uperior merits of celibacy, the
in&s;titution of the mona&s;tic life, the u&s;e of the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, of
holy oil, and even of images, the invocation of &s;aints, the wor&s;hip
of relics, the rudiments of purgatory in prayers for the dead, and
<PB N="45" REF="70">
the tremendous my&s;tery of the &s;acrifice of the body and blood of
Chri&s;t, which in&s;en&s;ibly &s;welled into the prodigy of tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion.
In the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, and already more than half a convert, I
formed an unlucky intimacy with a young gentleman of our college,
who&s;e name I &s;hall &s;pare. With a character le&s;s re&s;olute, Mr. ****
had imbibed the &s;ame religious opinions; and &s;ome Popi&s;h books, I
know not through what channel, were conveyed into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
I read, I applauded, I believed: the Engli&s;h tran&s;lations of two fa|mous
works of Bo&s;&s;uet Bi&s;hop of Meaux, the Expo&s;ition of the Ca|tholic
Doctrine, and the Hi&s;tory of the Prote&s;tant Variations, at|chieved
my conver&s;ion, and I &s;urely fell by a noble hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gibbon never talked with me on the &s;ubject of his conver&s;ion to popery but once; and then, he imputed his change to the works of Par&s;ons the je&s;uit, who lived in the reign of Elizabeth, and who, he &s;aid, had urged all the be&s;t arguments in favour of the Roman catholic religion.</NOTE>. I have
&s;ince examined the originals with a more di&s;cerning eye, and &s;hall
not he&s;itate to pronounce, that Bo&s;&s;uet is indeed a ma&s;ter of all the
weapons of controver&s;y. In the Expo&s;ition, a &s;pecious apology, the
orator a&s;&s;umes, with con&s;ummate art, the tone of candour and &s;im|plicity;
and the ten-horned mon&s;ter is tran&s;formed, at his magic
touch, into the milk-white hind, who mu&s;t be loved as &s;oon as &s;he
is &s;een. In the Hi&s;tory, a bold and well-aimed attack, he di&s;plays,
with a happy mixture of narrative and argument, the faults and
follies, the changes and contradictions of our fir&s;t reformers;
who&s;e variations (as he dexterou&s;ly contends) are the mark of hi&s;to|rical
error, while the perpetual unity of the catholic church is the
&s;ign and te&s;t of infallible truth. To my pre&s;ent feelings it &s;eems in|credible
that I &s;hould ever believe that I believed in tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion.
But my conqueror oppre&s;&s;ed me with the &s;acramental words,
"Hoc e&s;t corpus meum," and da&s;hed again&s;t each other the figura|tive
half-meanings of the prote&s;tant &s;ects: every objection was re|&s;olved
into omnipotence; and after repeating at St. Mary's the Atha|na&s;ian

creed, I humbly acquie&s;ced in the my&s;tery of the real
pre&s;ence.
<Q><L>"To take up half on tru&s;t, and half of try,</L>

<L>"For who would break with Heaven, and would not break for all?"</L></Q>
No &s;ooner had I &s;ettled my new religion than I re&s;olved to profe&s;s
my&s;elf a catholic. Youth is &s;incere and impetuous; and a moment|ary
glow of enthu&s;ia&s;m had rai&s;ed me above all temporal con&s;ider|ations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He de&s;cribed the letter to his father, announcing his conver&s;ion, as written with all the pomp, the dignity, and &s;elf-&s;atisfaction of a martyr.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By the keen prote&s;tants, who would gladly retaliate the example
of per&s;ecution, a clamour is rai&s;ed of the increa&s;e of popery: and
they are always loud to declaim again&s;t the toleration of prie&s;ts and
je&s;uits, who pervert &s;o many of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from their reli|gion
and allegiance. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, the fall of one or more
of her &s;ons directed this clamour again&s;t the univer&s;ity; and it was
confidently affirmed that popi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries were &s;uffered, under va|rious
di&s;gui&s;es, to introduce them&s;elves into the colleges of Oxford.
But ju&s;tice obliges me to declare, that, as far as relates to my&s;elf,
this a&s;&s;ertion is fal&s;e; and that I never conver&s;ed with a prie&s;t, or
even with a papi&s;t, till my re&s;olution from books was ab&s;olutely
fixed. In my la&s;t excur&s;ion to London, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Mr.
Lewis, a Roman catholic book&s;eller in Ru&s;&s;ell-&s;treet, Covent Garden,
who recommended me to a prie&s;t, of who&s;e name and order I am at
pre&s;ent ignorant. In our fir&s;t interview he &s;oon di&s;covered that per|&s;ua&s;ion
was needle&s;s. After &s;ounding the motives and merits of my
<PB N="47" REF="72">
conver&s;ion, he con&s;ented to admit me into the pale of the church;
and at his feet, on the eighth of June 1753, I &s;olemnly, though pri|vately,
abjured the errors of here&s;y. The &s;eduction of an Engli&s;h
youth of family and fortune was an act of as much danger as glory; but
he bravely overlooked the danger, of which I was not then &s;ufficiently
informed. <Q>Where a per&s;on is reconciled to the &s;ee of Rome, or
procures others to be reconciled, the offence (&s;ays Black&s;tone)
amounts to high trea&s;on.</Q> And if the humanity of the age would
prevent the execution of this &s;anguinary &s;tatute, there were other
laws of a le&s;s odious ca&s;t, which condemned the prie&s;t to perpetual
impri&s;onment, and tran&s;ferred the pro&s;elyte's e&s;tate to his neare&s;t re|lation.
An elaborate controver&s;ial epi&s;tle, approved by my director,
and addre&s;&s;ed to my father, announced and ju&s;tified the &s;tep which I
had taken. My father was neither a bigot nor a philo&s;opher; but
his affection deplored the lo&s;s of an only &s;on; and his good &s;en&s;e was
a&s;toni&s;hed at my &s;trange departure from the religion of my country.
In the fir&s;t &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion he divulged a &s;ecret which prudence might
have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the gates of Magdalen College were for ever &s;hut
again&s;t my return. Many years afterwards, when the name of Gib|bon
was become as notorious as that of Middleton, it was indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
whi&s;pered at Oxford, that the hi&s;torian had formerly "turned
papi&s;t:" my character &s;tood expo&s;ed to the reproach of incon&s;tancy;
and this invidious topic would have been handled without mercy by
my opponents, could they have &s;eparated my cau&s;e from that of the
univer&s;ity. For my own part, I am proud of an hone&s;t &s;acrifice of
intere&s;t to con&s;cience. I can never blu&s;h, if my tender mind was en|tangled
in the &s;ophi&s;try that &s;educed the acute and manly under&s;tand|ings
of CHILLINGWORTH and BAYLE, who afterwards emerged
from &s;uper&s;ition to &s;ceptici&s;m.</P>
<P>While Charles the Fir&s;t goverened England, and was him&s;elf go|verned
by a catholic queen, it cannot be denied that the mi&s;&s;ionaries
<PB N="48" REF="73">
of Rome laboured with impunity and &s;ucce&s;s in the court, the coun|try,
and even the univer&s;ities. One of the &s;heep,
<Q><L>&mdash;Whom the grim wolf with privy paw</L>
<L>Daily devours apace, and nothing &s;aid,</L></Q>
is Mr. William Chillingworth, Ma&s;ter of Arts, and Fellow of Tri|nity
College, Oxford; who, at the ripe age of twenty-eight years,
was per&s;uaded to elope from Oxford, to the Engli&s;h &s;eminary at
Douay in Flanders. Some di&s;putes with Fi&s;her, a &s;ubtle je&s;uit, might
fir&s;t awaken him from the prejudices of education; but he yielded to
his own victorious argument, <Q>that there mu&s;t be &s;omewhere an in|fallible
judge; and that the church of Rome is the only chri&s;tian
&s;ociety which either does or can pretend to that character.</Q> After
a &s;hort trial of a few months, Mr. Chillingworth was again tormented
by religious &s;cruples: he returned home, re&s;umed his &s;tudies, unra|velled
his mi&s;takes, and delivered his mind from the yoke of autho|rity
and &s;uper&s;tition. His new creed was built on the principle, that
the Bible is our &s;ole judge, and private rea&s;on our &s;ole interpreter:
and he ably maintains this principle in the Religion of a Prote&s;tant,
a book which, after &s;tartling the doctors of Oxford, is &s;till e&s;teemed
the mo&s;t &s;olid defence of the Reformation. The learning, the virtue,
the recent merits of the author, entitled him to fair preferment: but
the &s;lave had now br&oacute;ken his fetters; and the more he weighed, the le&s;s
was he di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe to the thirty-nine articles of the church
of England. In a private letter he declares, with all the energy of
language, that he could not &s;ub&s;cribe to them without &s;ub&s;cribing to his
own damnation; and that if ever he &s;hould depart from this immoveable
re&s;olution, he would allow his friends to think him a madman, or an
athei&s;t. As the letter is without a date, we cannot a&s;certain the num|ber
of weeks or months that elap&s;ed between this pa&s;&s;ionate abhor|rence
and the Sali&s;bury Regi&s;ter, which is &s;till extant. <Q>Ego Gu|lielmus
Chillingworth,...omnibus hi&s;ce articulis,...et &s;in|gulis

in ii&s;dem contentis volens, et ex animo &s;ub&s;cribo, et con&s;en&s;um
meum ii&s;dem praebeo. 20 die Julii 1638.</Q> But, alas! the chan|cellor
and prebendary of Sarum &s;oon deviated from his own &s;ub&s;crip|tion:
as he more deeply &s;crutinized the article of the Trinity, neither
&s;cripture nor the primitive fathers could long uphold his orthodox
belief; and he could not but confe&s;s, <Q>that the doctrine of Arius is
either a truth, or at lea&s;t no damnable here&s;y.</Q> From this middle
region of the air, the de&s;cent of his rea&s;on would naturally re&s;t on
the firmer ground of the Socinians: and if we may credit a doubtful
&s;tory, and the popular opinion, his anxious inquiries at la&s;t &s;ub&s;ided
in philo&s;ophic indifference. So con&s;picuous, however, were the can|dour
of his nature and the innocence of his heart, that this appa|rent
levity did not affect the reputation of Chillingworth. His fre|quent
changes proceeded from too nice an inqui&s;ition into truth.
His doubts grew out of him&s;elf; he a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with all the &s;trength
of his rea&s;on: he was then too hard for him&s;elf; but finding as little
quiet and repo&s;e in tho&s;e victories, he quickly recovered, by a new
appeal to his own judgment: &s;o that in all his fallies and retreats, he
was in fact his own convert.</P>
<P>Bayle was the &s;on of a Calvini&s;t mini&s;ter in a remote province of
France, at the foot of the Pyrenees. For the benefit of education,
the prote&s;tants were tempted to ri&s;k their children in the catholic
univer&s;ities; and in the twenty-&s;econd year of his age, young Bayle
was &s;educed by the arts and arguments of the je&s;uits of Thoulou&s;e.
He remained about &s;eventeen months (19th March 1669&mdash;19th Au|gu&s;t
1670) in their hands, a voluntary captive; and a letter to his
parents, which the new convert compo&s;ed or &s;ub&s;cribed (15th April
1670), is darkly tinged with the &s;pirit of popery. But Nature had
de&s;igned him to think as he plea&s;ed, and to &s;peak as he thought: his
piety was offended by the exce&s;&s;ive wor&s;hip of creatures; and the
&s;tudy of phy&s;ics convinced him of the impo&s;&s;ibility of tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion,
which is abundantly refuted by the te&s;timony of our &s;en&s;es.
<PB N="50" REF="75">
His return to the communion of a falling &s;ect was a bold and di&s;in|tere&s;ted
&s;tep, that expo&s;ed him to the rigour of the laws; and a &s;peedy
flight to Geneva protected him from the re&s;entment of his &s;piritual
tyrants, uncon&s;cious as they were of the full value of the prize, which
they had lo&s;t. Had Bayle adhered to the catholic church, had he
embraced the eccle&s;ia&s;tical profe&s;&s;ion, the genius and favour of &s;uch
a pro&s;elyte might have a&s;pired to wealth and honours in his native
country: but the hypocrite would have found le&s;s happine&s;s in the
comforts of a benefice, or the dignity of a mitre, than he enjoyed at
Rotterdam in a private &s;tate of exile, indigence, and freedom. With|out
a country, or a patron, or a prejudice, he claimed the liberty and
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the labours of his pen: the inequality of his voluminous
works is explained and excu&s;ed by his alternately writing for him|&s;elf,
for the book&s;ellers, and for po&s;terity; and if a &s;evere critic would
reduce him to a &s;ingle folio, that relic, like the books of the Sybil,
would become &s;till more valuable. A calm and lofty &s;pectator of the
religious tempe&s;t, the philo&s;opher of Rotterdam condemned with
equal firmne&s;s the per&s;ecution of Lewis the Fourteenth, and the re|publican
maxims of the Calvini&s;ts; their vain prophecies, and the in|tolerant
bigotry which &s;ometimes vexed his &s;olitary retreat. In re|viewing
the controver&s;ies of the times, he turned again&s;t each other
the arguments of the di&s;putants; &s;ucce&s;&s;ively wielding the arms of the
catholics and prote&s;tants, he proves that neither the way of authority,
nor the way of examination can afford the multitude any te&s;t of reli|gious
truth; and dexterou&s;ly concludes that cu&s;tom and education mu&s;t
be the &s;ole grounds of popular belief. The ancient paradox of Plu|tarch,
that athei&s;m is le&s;s pernicious than &s;uper&s;tition, acquires a ten|fold
vigor, when it is adorned with the colours of his wit, and pointed
with the acutene&s;s of his logic. His critical dictionary is a va&s;t repo|&s;itory
of facts and opinions; and he balances the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> religions in his
&s;ceptical &s;cales, till the oppo&s;ite quantities (if I may u&s;e the language
of algebra) annihilate each other. The wonderful power which he
<PB N="51" REF="76">
&s;o boldly exerci&s;ed, of a&s;&s;embling doubts and objections, had tempted
him joco&s;ely to a&s;&s;ume the title of the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the cloud-compelling
Jove; and in a conver&s;ation with the ingenious Abb&eacute;
(afterwards Cardinal) de Polignac, he freely di&s;clo&s;ed his univer&s;al
Pyrrhoni&s;m. <Q>I am mo&s;t truly (&s;aid Bayle) a prote&s;tant; for I
prote&s;t indifferently again&s;t all &s;y&s;tems and all &s;ects.</Q></P>
<P>The academical re&s;entment, which I may po&s;&s;ibly have provoked,
will prudently &s;pare this plain narrative of my &s;tudies, or rather of
my idlene&s;s; and of the unfortunate event which &s;hortened the term
of my re&s;idence at Oxford. But it may be &s;ugge&s;ted, that my father
was unlucky in the choice of a &s;ociety, and the chance of a tutor. It
will perhaps be a&s;&s;erted, that in the lap&s;e of forty years many im|provements
have taken place in the college and in the univer&s;ity. I
am not unwilling to believe, that &s;ome tutors might have been found
more active than Dr. Waldgrave, and le&s;s contemptible than Dr. ****.
About the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame walk, a Bentham was &s;till
treading in the foot&s;teps of a Burton, who&s;e maxims he had adopted,
and who&s;e life he had publi&s;hed. The biographer indeed preferred
the &s;chool-logic to the new philo&s;ophy, Bugur&s;dicius to Locke; and
the hero appears, in his own writings, a &s;tiff and conceited pedant.
Yet even the&s;e men, according to the mea&s;ure of their capacity,
might be diligent and u&s;eful; and it is recorded of Burton, that he
taught his pupils what he knew; &s;ome Latin, &s;ome Greek, &s;ome
ethics and metaphy&s;ics; referring them to proper ma&s;ters for the lan|guages
and &s;ciences of which he was ignorant. At a more recent
period, many &s;tudents have been attracted by the merit and reputa|tion
of Sir William Scott, then a tutor in Univer&s;ity College, and
now con&s;picuous in the profe&s;&s;ion of the civil law: my per&s;onal ac|quaintance
with that gentleman has in&s;pired me with a ju&s;t e&s;teem for
his abilities and knowledge; and I am a&s;&s;ured that his lectures on hi&s;|tory
would compo&s;e, were they given to the public, a mo&s;t valuable
treati&s;e. Under the au&s;pices of the pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop of York,

Dr. Markham, him&s;elf an eminent &s;cholar, a more regular di&s;cipline
has been introduced, as I am told, at Chri&s;t Church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written on the information Mr. Gibbon had received, and the ob&s;erva|tion he had made, previous to his late re&s;idence at Lau&s;anne. During his la&s;t vi&s;it to England, he had an opportunity of &s;eeing at Sheffield-place &s;ome young men of the college above alluded to; he had great &s;atisfaction in conver&s;ing with them, made many inquiries re&s;pecting their cour&s;e of &s;tudy, applauded the di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t Church, and the liberal attention &s;hewn by the Dean, to tho&s;e who&s;e only recommend|ation was their merit. Had Mr. Gibbon lived to revi&s;e this work, I am &s;ure he would have mentioned the name of Dr. Jack&s;on with the highe&s;t commendation. There are other colleges at Oxford, with who&s;e di&s;cipline my friend was unacquainted, to which, without doubt, he would willingly have allowed their due prai&s;e, particularly Brazen No&s;e and Oriel Colleges; the former under the care of Dr. Cleaver, bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, the latter under that of Dr. Eveleigh. It is &s;till greatly to be wi&s;hed that the general expence, or rather extravagance, of young men at our Engli&s;h univer&s;ities may be more effectually re&s;trained. The expence, in which they are permitted to indulge, is incon&s;i&s;tent not only with a nece&s;&s;ary degree of &s;tudy, but with tho&s;e habits of mo|rality which &s;hould be promoted, by all means po&s;&s;ible, at an early period of life. An academical education in England is at pre&s;ent an object of alarm and terror to every thinking parent of moderate fortune. It is the apprehen&s;ion of the expence, of the di&s;&s;ipation, and other evil con&s;equences, which ari&s;e from the want of proper re&s;traint at our own univer&s;ities, that forces a number of our Engli&s;h youths to tho&s;e of Scot|land, and utterly excludes many from any &s;ort of academical in&s;truction. If a charge be true, which I have heard in&s;i&s;ted on, that the heads of our colleges in Oxford and Cambridge are vain of having under their care chiefly men of opulence, who may be &s;uppo&s;ed exempt from the nece&s;&s;ity of oeconomical controul, they are indeed highly cen&s;urable; &s;ince the mi&s;chief of allowing early habits of expence and di&s;&s;ipation is great, in various re&s;pects, even to tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of large property; and the mo&s;t &s;erious evil from this indulgence mu&s;t happen to youths of humbler fortune, who certainly form the majority of &s;tudents both at Oxford and Cambridge. S.</NOTE>; a cour&s;e of
cla&s;&s;ical and philo&s;ophical &s;tudies is propo&s;ed, and even pur&s;ued, in
that numerous &s;eminary: learning has been made a duty, a plea&s;ure,
and even a fa&s;hion; and &s;everal young gentlemen do honour to
the college in which they have been educated. According to the
will of the donor, the profit of the &s;econd part of Lord Clarendon's
Hi&s;tory has been applied to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a riding-&s;chool, that
the polite exerci&s;es might be taught, I know not with what &s;ucce&s;s,
in the univer&s;ity. The Vinerian profe&s;&s;or&s;hip is of far more &s;erious
importance; the laws of his country are the fir&s;t &s;cience of an Eng|li&s;hman
<PB N="53" REF="78">
of rank and fortune, who is called to be a magi&s;trate, and
may hope to be a legi&s;lator. This judicious in&s;titution was coldly
entertained by the graver doctors, who complained (I have heard the
complaint) that it would take the young people from their books:
but Mr. Viner's benefaction is not unprofitable, &s;ince it has at lea&s;t
produced the excellent commentaries of Sir William Black&s;tone.</P>
<P>After carrying me to Putney, to the hou&s;e of his friend Mr. Mallet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of a life of Bacon, which has been rated above its value; of &s;ome forgotten poems and plays; and of the pathetic ballad of William and Margaret.</NOTE>,
by who&s;e philo&s;ophy I was rather &s;candalized than reclaimed, it was
nece&s;&s;ary for my father to form a new plan of education, and to de|vi&s;e
&s;ome method which, if po&s;&s;ible, might effect the cure of my
&s;piritual malady. After much debate it was determined, from the
advice and per&s;onal experience of Mr. Eliot (now Lord Eliot) to fix
me, during &s;ome years, at Lau&s;anne in Switzerland. Mr. Frey, a
Swi&s;s gentleman of Ba&s;il, undertook the conduct of the journey: we
left London the 19th of June, cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea from Dover to Calais,
travelled po&s;t through &s;everal provinces of France, by the direct road
of St. Quentin, Rheims, Langres, and Be&s;an&ccedil;on, and arrived the
30th of June at Lau&s;anne, where I was immediately &s;ettled under
the roof and tuition of Mr. Pavilliard, a Calvini&s;t mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t marks of my father's di&s;plea&s;ure rather a&s;toni&s;hed than
afflicted me: when he threatened to bani&s;h, and di&s;own, and di&s;in|herit
a rebellious &s;on, I cheri&s;hed a &s;ecret hope that he would not be
able or willing to effect his menaces; and the pride of con&s;cience
encouraged me to &s;u&s;tain the honourable and important part which I
was now acting. My &s;pirits were rai&s;ed and kept alive by the rapid
motion of my journey, the new and various &s;cenes of the Continent,
and the civility of Mr. Frey, a man of &s;en&s;e, who was not ignorant
of books or the world. But after he had re&s;igned me into Pavilliard's
hands, and I was fixed in my new habitation, I had lei&s;ure to con|template
<PB N="54" REF="79">
the &s;trange and melancholy pro&s;pect before me. My fir&s;t
complaint aro&s;e from my ignorance of the language. In my child|hood
I had once &s;tudied the French grammar, and I could imper|fectly
under&s;tand the ea&s;y pro&s;e of a familiar &s;ubject. But when I
was thus &s;uddenly ca&s;t on a foreign land, I found my&s;elf deprived of
the u&s;e of &s;peech and of hearing; and, during &s;ome weeks, incapable
not only of enjoying the plea&s;ures of conver&s;ation, but even of a&s;king
or an&s;wering a que&s;tion in the common intercour&s;e of life. To a
home-bred Engli&s;hman every object, every cu&s;tom was offen&s;ive;
but the native of any country might have been di&s;gu&s;ted with the
general a&s;pect of his lodging and entertainment. I had now ex|changed
my elegant apartment in Magdalen College, for a narrow,
gloomy &s;treet, the mo&s;t unfrequented of an unhand&s;ome town, for
an old inconvenient hou&s;e, and for a &s;mall chamber ill-contrived and
ill-furni&s;hed, which, on the approach of Winter, in&s;tead of a com|panionable
fire, mu&s;t be warmed by the dull invi&s;ible heat of a &s;tove.
From a man I was again degraded to the dependance of a &s;chool-boy.
Mr. Pavilliard managed my expences, which had been reduced to
a diminutive &s;tate: I received a &s;mall monthly allowance for my
pocket-money; and helple&s;s and awkward as I have ever been,
I no longer enjoyed the indi&s;pen&s;able comfort of a &s;ervant. My
condition &s;eemed as de&s;titute of hope, as it was devoid of plea|&s;ure:
I was &s;eparated for an indefinite, which appeared an infinite
term from my native country; and I had lo&s;t all connection with
my catholic friends. I have &s;ince reflected with &s;urpri&s;e, that as the
Romi&s;h clergy of every part of Europe maintain a clo&s;e corre&s;pond|ence
with each other, they never attempted, by letters or me&s;&s;ages,
to re&s;cue me from the hands of the heretics, or at lea&s;t to confirm
my zeal and con&s;tancy in the profe&s;&s;ion of the faith. Such was my
fir&s;t introduction to Lau&s;anne; a place where I &s;pent nearly five years
with plea&s;ure and profit, which I afterwards revi&s;ited without com|pul&s;ion,
and which I have finally &s;elected as the mo&s;t grateful retreat
for the decline of my life.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="80">
But it is the peculiar felicity of youth that the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing ob|jects
and events &s;eldom make a deep or la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion; it forgets
the pa&s;t, enjoys the pre&s;ent, and anticipates the future. At the
flexible age of &s;ixteen I &s;oon learned to endure, and gradually to
adopt, the new forms of arbitrary manners: the real hard&s;hips of my
&s;ituation were alienated by time. Had I been &s;ent abroad in a more
&s;plendid &s;tyle, &s;uch as the fortune and bounty of my father might
have &s;upplied, I might have returned home with the &s;ame &s;tock of
language and &s;cience, which our countrymen u&s;ually import from the
Continent. An exile and a pri&s;oner as I was, their example be|trayed
me into &s;ome irregularities of wine, of play, and of idle ex|cur&s;ions:
but I &s;oon felt the impo&s;&s;ibility of a&s;&s;ociating with them on
equal terms; and after the departure of my fir&s;t acquaintance, I held
a cold and civil corre&s;pondence with their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. This &s;eclu&s;ion
from Engli&s;h &s;ociety was attended with the mo&s;t &s;olid benefits. In
the <HI>Pays de Vaud,</HI> the French language is u&s;ed with le&s;s imperfection
than in mo&s;t of the di&s;tant provinces of France: in Pavilliard's fa|mily,
nece&s;&s;ity compelled me to li&s;ten and to &s;peak; and if I was at
fir&s;t di&s;heartened by the apparent &s;lowne&s;s, in a few months I was
a&s;toni&s;hed by the rapidity of my progre&s;s. My pronunciation was
formed by the con&s;tant repetition of the &s;ame &s;ounds; the variety of
words and idioms, the rules of grammar, and di&s;tinctions of genders,
were impre&s;&s;ed in my memory: ea&s;e and freedom were obtained by
practice; correctne&s;s and elegance by labour; and before I was re|called
home, French, in which I &s;pontaneou&s;ly thought, was more
familiar than Engli&s;h to my ear, my tongue, and my pen. The fir&s;t
effect of this opening knowledge was the revival of my love of read|ing,
which had been chilled at Oxford; and I &s;oon turned over,
without much choice, almo&s;t all the French books in my tutor's li|brary.
Even the&s;e amu&s;ements were productive of real advantage:
my ta&s;te and judgment were now &s;omewhat riper. I was introduced
to a new mode of &s;tyle and literature: by the compari&s;on of manners
<PB N="56" REF="81">
and opinions, my views were enlarged, my prejudices were corrected,
and a copious voluntary ab&s;tract of the <HI>Hi&s;toire de l'Egli&s;e at de l'Em|pire,</HI>
by le Sueur, may be placed in a middle line between my childi&s;h
and my manly &s;tudies. As &s;oon as I was able to conver&s;e with the
natives, I began to feel &s;ome &s;atisfaction in their company: my awk|ward
timidity was poli&s;hed and emboldened; and I frequented, for
the fir&s;t time, a&s;&s;emblies of men and women. The acquaintance of
the Pavilliards prepared me by degrees for more elegant &s;ociety. I
was received with kindne&s;s and indulgence in the be&s;t families of
Lau&s;anne; and it was in one of the&s;e that I formed an intimate and
la&s;ting connection with Mr. Deyverdun, a young man of an amiable
temper and excellent under&s;tanding. In the arts of fencing and
dancing, &s;mall indeed was my proficiency; and &s;ome months were
idly wa&s;ted in the riding-&s;chool. My unfitne&s;s to bodily exerci&s;e
reconciled me to a &s;edentary life, and the hor&s;e, the favourite of my
countrymen, never contributed to the plea&s;ures of my youth.</P>
<P>My obligations to the le&s;&s;ons of Mr. Pavilliard, gratitude will not
&s;uffer me to forget: he was endowed with a clear head and a warm
heart; his innate benevolence had a&s;&s;uaged the &s;pirit of the church;
he was rational, becau&s;e he was moderate: in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies
he had acquired a ju&s;t though &s;uperficial knowledge of mo&s;t branches

we began to under&s;tand each other, he gently led me, from a blind
and undi&s;tingui&s;hing love of reading, into the path of in&s;truction.
I con&s;ented with plea&s;ure that a portion of the morning-hours &s;hould
be con&s;ecrated to a plan of modern hi&s;tory and geography, and to the
critical peru&s;al of the French and Latin cla&s;&s;ics; and at each &s;tep I
felt my&s;elf invigorated by the habits of application and method. His
prudence repre&s;&s;ed and di&s;&s;embled &s;ome youthful fallies; and as &s;oon
as I was confirmed in the habits of indu&s;try and temperance, he gave
the reins into my own hands. His favourable report of my beha|viour
and progre&s;s gradually obtained &s;ome latitude of action and
expence; and he wi&s;hed to alleviate the hard&s;hips of my lodging and
entertainment. The principles of philo&s;ophy were a&s;&s;ociated with
the examples of ta&s;te; and by a &s;ingular chance, the book, as well as
the man, which contributed the mo&s;t effectually to my education, has
a &s;tronger claim on my gratitude than on my admiration. Mr. De
Crou&s;az, the adver&s;ary of Bayle and Pope, is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by lively
fancy or profound reflection; and even in his own country, at the
end of a few years, his name and writings are almo&s;t obliterated.
But his philo&s;ophy had been formed in the &s;chool of Locke, his di|vinity
<PB N="58" REF="83">
in that of Limborch and Le Clerc; in a long and laborious
life, &s;everal generations of pupils were taught to think, and even to
write; his le&s;&s;ons re&s;cued the academy of Lau&s;anne from Calvini&s;tic
prejudice; and he had the rare merit of diffu&s;ing a more liberal &s;pirit
among the clergy and people of the Pays de Vaud. His &s;y&s;tem of
logic, which in the la&s;t editions has &s;welled to &s;ix tedious and prolix
volumes, may be prai&s;ed as a clear and methodical abridgment of the
art of rea&s;oning, from our &s;imple ideas to the mo&s;t complex opera|tions
of the human under&s;tanding. This &s;y&s;tem I &s;tudied, and medi|tated,
and ab&s;tracted, till I have obtained the free command of an
univer&s;al in&s;trument, which I &s;oon pre&s;umed to exerci&s;e on my ca|tholic
opinions. Pavilliard was not unmindful that his fir&s;t ta&s;k, his
mo&s;t important duty, was to reclaim me from the errors of popery.
The intermixture of &s;ects has rendered the Swi&s;s clergy acute and
learned on the topics of controver&s;y; and I have &s;ome of his letters
in which he celebrates the dexterity of his attack, and my gradual
conce&s;&s;ions, after a firm and well-managed defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Pavilliard has de&s;cribed to me the a&s;toni&s;hment with which he gazed on Mr. Gibbon &s;tanding before him: a thin little figure, with a large head, di&s;puting and urging, with the greate&s;t ability, all the be&s;t arguments that had ever been u&s;ed in favour of popery. Mr. Gibbon many years ago became very fat and corpulent, but he had uncommonly &s;mall bones, and was very &s;light made.</NOTE>. I was willing,
and I am now willing, to allow him a hand&s;ome &s;hare of the honour
of my conver&s;ion: yet I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it was principally effected
by my private reflections; and I &s;till remember my &s;olitary tran&s;port
at the di&s;covery of a philo&s;ophical argument again&s;t the doctrine of
tran&s;ub&s;tantiation: <HI>that</HI> the text of &s;cripture, which &s;eems to inculcate
the real pre&s;ence, is atte&s;ted only by a &s;ingle &s;en&s;e&mdash;our &s;ight; while
the real pre&s;ence it&s;elf is di&s;proved by three of our &s;en&s;es&mdash;the &s;ight,
the touch, and the ta&s;te. The various articles of the Romi&s;h creed di&s;|appeared
like a dream; and after a full conviction, on Chri&s;tmas-day
1754, I received the &s;acrament in the church of Lau&s;anne. It was

La de&s;&s;us je n'ai pas jug&eacute; qu'il fallut le pou&s;&s;er &agrave; bout, et extorquer de lui un aveu que &s;on coeur de&s;avoueroit; je lui donnois alors du tems pour r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir; tous mes livres etoient &agrave; &s;a di&s;po&s;ition; je revenois &agrave; la charge quand il m'avouoit qu'il avoit etudi&eacute; la matiere au&s;&s;i bien qu'il l'avoit pu, et en&s;in j'etabli&s;&s;oit une verit&eacute;.</P>
<P>Je me per&s;uadois, que quand j'aurois detruit les principales erreurs de l'egli&s;e Ro|maine, je n'aurois qu'&agrave; faire voir que les autres &s;ont des con&s;equences des premi&egrave;res, et qu'elles ne peuvent &s;ub&s;i&s;ter quand les fundamentales &s;ont renver&s;&eacute;es; mais, comme je l'ai dit, je me &s;uis tromp&eacute;, il a fallu traitter chaque article dans &s;on entier. Par la grace de Dieu, je n'ai pas perdu mon tems, et aujourdhui, &s;i meme il con&s;erve quelques re&s;tes de &s;es pernicieu&s;es erreurs, j'o&s;e dire qu'il n'e&s;t plus membre de l'egli&s;e Romaine; voici dans o&ugrave; nous en &s;ommes.</P>
<P>J'ai renver&s;&eacute; l'infallibilit&eacute; de l'egli&s;e; j'ai prouv&eacute; que jamais St. Pierre n'a &eacute;t&eacute; chef des ap&ocirc;tres; que quand il l'auroit &eacute;t&eacute;, le pape n'e&s;t point &s;on &s;ucce&s;&s;eur; qu'il e&s;t dou|teu&s;e que St. Pierre a jamais &eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; Rome, mais &s;uppo&s;&eacute; qu'il y ait &eacute;t&eacute;, il n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; ev&ecirc;que de cette ville: que la tran&s;ub&s;tantiation e&s;t un invention humaine, et peu ancienne dans l'egli&s;e; que l'adoration de l'Euchari&s;te et le retranchement de la coupe &s;ont contraires &agrave; la parole de Dieu: qu'il y a des &s;aints, mais que nous ne &s;avons pas que ils &s;ont, et par con&s;equent qu'on ne peut pas le prier; que le re&s;pect et le culte qu'on rend aux reliques e&s;t condamnable; qu'il n'y a point de purgatoire, et que la doctrine des indulgences e&s;t fau&s;&s;e: que la Careme et les jeunes du Vendredi et du Sa|medi &s;ont ridicules aujourdhui, et de la maniere que l'egli&s;e Romaine les pre&s;crit: que les imputations que l'egli&s;e de Rome nous fait de varier dans notre doctrine, et d'avoir pour reformateurs des per&s;onnes dont la conduite et les moeurs ont &eacute;t&eacute; en &s;candale, &s;ont entierement fau&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Vous comprenez bien, Mon&s;ieur, que ces articles &s;ont d'un longue di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, qu'il a fallu du tems &agrave; Mon&s;ieur votre &s;ils pour mediter mes rai&s;ons et pour y chercher des repon&s;es. Je lui ai demand&eacute; plu&s;ieurs &s;ois, &s;i mes preuves et mes rai&s;ons lui paroi&s;|&s;oient convainquantes; il m'a toujours a&s;&s;ur&eacute; qu'oui, de fa&ccedil;on que j'o&s;e a&s;&s;urer, au&s;&s;i comme je le lui a dit &agrave; lui meme, il y a peu de tems qu'il n'&eacute;toit plus catholique Ro|main. Je me flatte, qu'apr&egrave;s avoir obtenu la victoire &s;ur ces articles, je l'aurai &s;ur le re&s;te avec le &s;ecours de Dieu. Tellement que je compte de vous marquer dans peu que cette ouvrage e&s;t fini, je dois vous dire encore, que quoique j'ai trouv&eacute; M^r votre fils tr&egrave;s ferme dans &s;es id&eacute;es, je l'ai trouv&eacute; rai&s;onnable, qu'il s'e&s;t rendu &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re, et qu'il n'e&s;t pas, ce qu'on appelle, chicaneur. Par raport &agrave; l'article du jeune le Venredi et Sa|medi, long tems apres que je vous eus ecrit qu'il n'avoit jamais marqu&eacute; qu'il voulut l'ob|&s;erver, environ le commencement du mois de Mars je m'aper&ccedil;us un Vendredi qu'il ne mangeoit point de viande; je lui parlai en particulier pour en &s;avoir la rai&s;on, craig|nant que ce ne fut par indi&s;po&s;ition; il me repondit qu'il l'avoit fait &agrave; de&s;&s;ein, et qu'il avoit cru &ecirc;tre oblig&eacute; de &s;e conformer &agrave; la pratique d'un egli&s;e dont il etoit membre: nous parlames quelques tems &s;ur ce &s;ujet; il m'a&s;&s;ura qu'il n'invi&s;ageoit cela que comme une pratique bonne &agrave; la verit&eacute;, et qu'il devoit &s;uivre, quoiqu'il ne la crus pas &s;ainte en elle meme, ni d'in&s;titution divine. Je ne crus pas devoir in&s;i&s;ter pour lors, ni le forcer &agrave; agir contre &s;es lumi&egrave;res: j'ai traitt&eacute; cette article qu'e&s;t certainement un des moins importans, des moins fond&eacute;s; et cependant il m'a fallu un tems con&s;iderable pour le detromper, et pour lui faire comprendre qu'il avoit tort de s'a&s;&s;ujettir &agrave; la pra|tique d'un Egli&s;e qu'il ne reconnoi&s;&s;oit plus pour infaillible; que &s;i meme cette pra|tique avoit eu quelque utilit&eacute; dans &s;on in&s;titution, cependant elle n'en avoit aucune en elle meme, puis qu'elle ne contribuoit en rien &agrave; la puret&eacute; des moeurs; qu'ain&s;i il n'y avoit aucune rai&s;on, ni dans l'in&s;titution de cette pratique, ni dans la pratique en elle m&ecirc;me, que l'autoris&acirc;t &agrave; s'y &s;oumettre: qu'aujourdhui ce n'etoit qu'une affaire d'interet, puis qu'avec de l'argent on obtennoit des di&s;pen&s;es pour manger gras, &amp;c. de manier que je l'ai ramen&eacute; &agrave; la libert&eacute; Chretienne avec beaucoup de peine et &s;eulement depuis quelques &s;e maines.

Such, from my arrival at Lau&s;anne, during the fir&s;t eighteen or
twenty months (July 1753&mdash;March 1755), were my u&s;eful &s;tudies,
the foundation of all my future improvements. But every man who
ri&s;es above the common level has received two educations: the fir&s;t
from his teachers; the &s;econd, more per&s;onal and important, from
him&s;elf. He will not, like the fanatics of the la&s;t age, define the
moment of grace; but he cannot forget the aera of his life, in which
his mind has expanded to its proper form and dimen&s;ions. My
worthy tutor had the good &s;en&s;e and mode&s;ty to di&s;corn how far he
could be u&s;eful: as &s;oon as he felt that I advanced beyond his &s;peed
and mea&s;ure, he wi&s;ely left me to my genius; and the hours of le&s;&s;on
<PB N="61" REF="86">
were &s;oon lo&s;t in the voluntary labour of the whole morning, and
&s;ometimes of the whole day. The de&s;ire of prolonging my time,
gradually confirmed the &s;alutary habit of early ri&s;ing; to which I have
always adhered, with &s;ome regard to &s;ea&s;ons and &s;ituations: but it is
happy for my eyes and my health, that my temperate ardour has
never been &s;educed to tre&s;pa&s;s on the hours of the night. During the
la&s;t three years of my re&s;idence at Lau&s;anne, I may a&s;&s;ume the merit
of &s;erious and &s;olid application; but I am tempted to di&s;tingui&s;h the
la&s;t eight months of the year 1755, as the period of the mo&s;t extra|ordinary
diligence and rapid progre&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOURNAL, December 1755.]&mdash;In fini&s;hing this year, I mu&s;t remark how favour|able it was to my &s;tudies. In the &s;pace of eight months, from the beginning of April, I learnt the principles of drawing; made my&s;elf complete ma&s;ter of the French and Latin languages, with which I was very &s;uperficially acquainted before, and wrote and tran&s;lated a great deal in both; read Cicero's Epi&s;tles ad Familiares, his Brutus, all his Orations, his Dialogues de Amiciti&acirc;, and De Senectute; Terence, twice; and Pliny's Epi&s;tles. In French, Giannone's Hi&s;tory of Naples, and l'Abb&eacute; Bannier's Mythology, and M. de Boehat's Memoirs &s;ur la Sui&s;&s;e, and wrote a very ample relation of my tour. I likewi&s;e began to &s;tudy Greek, and went through the Grammar. I begun to make very large collections of what I read. But what I e&s;teem mo&s;t of all, from the peru&s;al and meditation of De Crou&s;az's Logic, I not only under&s;tood the principles of that &s;cience, but formed my mind to a habit of thinking and rea&s;oning I had no idea of before.</NOTE>. In my French and Latin
tran&s;lations I adopted an excellent method, which, from my own &s;uc|ce&s;s,
I would recommend to the imitation of &s;tudents. I cho&s;e &s;ome
cla&s;&s;ic writer, &s;uch as Cicero and Vertot, the mo&s;t approved for
purity and elegance of &s;tyle. I tran&s;lated, for in&s;tance, an epi&s;tle of
Cicero into French; and after throwing it a&s;ide, till the words and
phra&s;es were obliterated from my memory, I re-tran&s;lated my French
into &s;uch Latin as I could find; and then compared each &s;entence of
my imperfect ver&s;ion, with the ea&s;e, the grace, the propriety of the
Roman orator. A &s;imilar experiment was made on &s;everal pages of
the Revolutions of Vertot; I turned them into Latin, returned them
<PB N="62" REF="87">
after a &s;ufficient interval into my own French, and again &s;crutinized
the re&s;emblance or di&s;&s;imilitude of the copy and the original. By
degrees I was le&s;s a&s;hamed, by degrees I was more &s;atisfied with my|&s;elf;
and I per&s;evered in the practice of the&s;e double tran&s;lations,
which filled &s;everal books, till I had acquired the knowledge of both
idioms, and the command at lea&s;t of a correct &s;tyle. This u&s;eful
exerci&s;e of writing was accompanied and &s;ucceeded by the more
plea&s;ing occupation of reading the be&s;t authors. The peru&s;al of the
Roman cla&s;&s;ics was at once my exerci&s;e and reward. Dr. Middle|ton's
Hi&s;tory, which I then appreciated above its true value, natu|rally
directed me to the writings of Cicero. The mo&s;t perfect edi|tions,
that of Olivet, which may adorn the &s;helves of the rich, that of
Erne&s;ti, which &s;hould lie on the table of the learned, were not in my
power. For the familiar epi&s;tles I u&s;ed the text and Engli&s;h comment|ary
of Bi&s;hop Ro&s;s: but my general edition was that of Verburgius,
publi&s;hed at Am&s;terdam in two large volumes in folio, with an in|different
choice of various notes. I read, with application and plea|&s;ure,
<HI>all</HI> the epi&s;tles, <HI>all</HI> the orations, and the mo&s;t important trea|ti&s;es
of rhetoric and philo&s;ophy; and as I read, I applauded the ob|&s;ervation
of Quintillian, that every &s;tudent may judge of his own
proficiency, by the &s;atisfaction which he receives from the Roman
orator. I ta&s;ted the beauties of language, I breathed the &s;pirit of
freedom, and I imbibed from his precepts and examples the public
and private &s;en&s;e of a man. Cicero in Latin, and Xenophon in
Greek, are indeed the two ancients whom I would fir&s;t propo&s;e to a
liberal &s;cholar; not only for the merit of their &s;tyle and &s;entiments,
but for the admirable le&s;&s;ons, which may be applied almo&s;t to every
&s;ituation of public and private life. Cicero's Epi&s;tles may in parti|cular
afford the models of every form of corre&s;pondence, from the
carele&s;s effu&s;ions of tenderne&s;s and friend&s;hip, to the well-guarded
declaration of di&s;creet and dignified re&s;entment. After fini&s;hing this

great author, a library of eloquence and rea&s;on, I formed a more
exten&s;ive plan of reviewing the Latin cla&s;&s;ics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOURNAL, January 1756.]&mdash;I determined to read over the Latin authors in or|der; and read this year, Virgil, Sallu&s;t, Livy, Velleius Paterculus, Valerius Maximus, Tacitus, Suetonius, Quintus Curtius, Ju&s;tin, Florus, Plautus, Terence, and Lucretius. I al&s;o read and meditated Locke upon the Under&s;tanding.</NOTE>, under the four divi|&s;ions
of, 1. hi&s;torians, 2. poets, 3. orators, and 4. philo&s;ophers, in
a chronological &s;eries, from the days of Plautus and Sallu&s;t, to the
decline of the language and empire of Rome: and this plan, in the
la&s;t twenty-&s;even months of my re&s;idence at Lau&s;anne (January
1756&mdash;April 1758), I <HI>nearly</HI> accompli&s;hed. Nor was this review,
however rapid, either ha&s;ty or &s;uper&s;icial. I indulged my&s;elf in a
&s;econd and even a third peru&s;al of Terence, Virgil, Horace, Tacitus,
&amp;c. and &s;tudied to imbibe the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit mo&s;t congenial to my
own. I never &s;uffered a difficult or corrupt pa&s;&s;age to e&s;cape, till I
had viewed it in every light of which it was &s;u&s;ceptible: though often
di&s;appointed, I always con&s;ulted the mo&s;t learned or ingenious com|mentators,
Torrentius and Dacier on Horace, Catrou and Servius on
Virgil, Lip&s;ius on Tacitus, Meziriac on Ovid, &amp;c.; and in the ardour
of my inquiries, I embraced a large circle of hi&s;torical and critical
erudition. My ab&s;tracts of each book were made in the French
language: my ob&s;ervations often branched into particular e&s;&s;ays; and
I can &s;till read, without contempt, a di&s;&s;ertation of eight folio pages
on eight lines (287-294) of the fourth Georgic of Virgil. Mr.
Deyverdun, my friend, who&s;e name will be frequently repeated,
had joined with equal zeal, though not with equal per&s;everance, in
the &s;ame undertaking. To him every thought, every compo&s;ition,
was in&s;tantly communicated; with him I enjoyed the benefits of a
free conver&s;ation on the topics of our common &s;tudies.</P>
<P>But it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for a mind endowed with any active cu|rio&s;ity
to be long conver&s;ant with the Latin cla&s;&s;ics, without a&s;piring

<P>It was now that I regretted the early years which had been
wa&s;ted in &s;ickne&s;s or idlene&s;s, or mere idle reading; that I con|demned
the perver&s;e method of our &s;choolma&s;ters, who, by fir&s;t
teaching the mother-language, might de&s;cend with &s;o much ea&s;e and
per&s;picuity to the origin and etymology of a derivative idiom. In
the nineteenth year of my age I determined to &s;upply this defect;
and the le&s;&s;ons of Pavilliard again contributed to &s;mooth the entrance
of the way, the Greek alphabet, the grammar, and the pronunci|ation
according to the French accent. At my earne&s;t reque&s;t we
pre&s;umed to open the Iliad; and I had the plea&s;ure of beholding,
though darkly and through a gla&s;s, the true image of Homer, whom
I had long &s;ince admired in an Engli&s;h dre&s;s. After my tutor had left
me to my&s;elf, I worked my way through about half the Iliad, and af|terwards
interpreted alone a large portion of Xenophon and Hero|dotus.
But my ardour, de&s;titute of aid and emulation, was gra|dually
cooled, and, from the barren ta&s;k of &s;earching words in a
lexicon, I withdrew to the free and familiar conver&s;ation of Virgil
and Tacitus. Yet in my re&s;idence at Lau&s;anne I had laid a &s;olid
foundation, which enabled me, in a more propitious &s;ea&s;on, to pro|&s;ecute
the &s;tudy of Grecian literature.</P>

&s;o rea&s;onable a wi&s;h. During two winters I attended the private

<PB N="66" REF="91">
was totally extinct, I was content to receive the pa&s;&s;ive impre&s;&s;ion
of my Profe&s;&s;or's lectures, without any active exerci&s;e of my own
powers. As &s;oon as I under&s;tood the principles, I relinqui&s;hed for ever
the pur&s;uit of the mathematics; nor can I lament that I de&s;i&s;ted,
before my mind was hardened by the habit of rigid demon&s;tration,
&s;o de&s;tructive of the &s;iner feelings of moral evidence, which mu&s;t,
however, determine the actions and opinions of our lives. I li&s;tened
with more plea&s;ure to the propo&s;al of &s;tudying the law of nature and
nations, which was taught in the academy of Lau&s;anne by Mr.
Vicat, a profe&s;&s;or of &s;ome learning and reputation. But, in&s;tead of
attending his public or private cour&s;e, I preferred in my clo&s;et the
le&s;&s;ons of his ma&s;ters, and my own rea&s;on. Without being di&s;gu&s;ted
by Grotius or Puffendorf, I &s;tudied in their writings the duties of a
man, the rights of a citizen, the theory of ju&s;tice (it is, alas! a
theory), and the laws of peace and war, which have had &s;ome influ|ence
on the practice of modern Europe. My fatigues were alleviated
by the good &s;en&s;e of their commentator Barbeyrac. Locke's Treati&s;e
of Government in&s;tructed me in the knowledge of Whig principles,
which are rather founded in rea&s;on than experience; but my delight
was in the frequent peru&s;al of Monte&s;quieu, who&s;e energy of &s;tyle,
and boldne&s;s of hypothe&s;is, were powerful to awaken and &s;timulate
the genius of the age. The logic of De Crou&s;az had prepared me to
<PB N="67" REF="92">
engage with his ma&s;ter Locke, and his antagoni&s;t Bayle; of whom
the former may be u&s;ed as a bridle, and the latter applied as a &s;pur,
to the curio&s;ity of a young philo&s;opher. According to the nature of
their re&s;pective works, the &s;chools of argument and objection, I care|fully
went through the E&s;&s;ay on Human Under&s;tanding, and occa|&s;ionally
con&s;ulted the mo&s;t intere&s;ting articles of the Philo&s;ophic Dic|tionary.
In the infancy of my rea&s;on I turned over, as an idle
amu&s;ement, the mo&s;t &s;erious and important treati&s;e: in its maturity,
the mo&s;t trifling performance could exerci&s;e my ta&s;te or judgment;
and more than once I have been led by a novel into a deep and in|&s;tructive
train of thinking. But I cannot forbear to mention three
particular books, &s;ince they may have remotely contributed to form
the hi&s;torian of the Roman empire. 1. From the Provincial Letters
of Pa&s;cal, which almo&s;t every year I have peru&s;ed with new plea&s;ure,
I learned to manage the weapon of grave and temperate irony, even
on &s;ubjects of eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;olemnity. 2. The Life of Julian, by
the Abb&eacute; de la Bleterie, fir&s;t introduced me to the man and the
times; and I &s;hould be glad to recover my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay on the truth
of the miracle which &s;topped the rebuilding of the Temple of Jeru|&s;alem.
3. In Giannone's Civil Hi&s;tory of Naples, I ob&s;erved with
a critical eye the progre&s;s and abu&s;e of &s;acerdotal power, and the
revolutions of Italy in the darker ages. This various reading,
which I now conducted with di&s;cretion, was dige&s;ted, according to
the precept and model of Mr. Locke, into a large common-place
book; a practice, however, which I do not &s;trenuou&s;ly recom|mend.
The action of the pen will doubtle&s;s imprint an idea on
the mind as well as on the paper: but I much que&s;tion whether
the benefits of this laborious method are adequate to the wa&s;te
of time; and I mu&s;t agree with Dr. John&s;on, (Idler, No. 74.)
<Q>that what is twice read, is commonly better remembered, than
what is tran&s;cribed.</Q></P>

During two years, if I forget &s;ome boyi&s;h excur&s;ions of a day or a

with Pavilliard: and our &s;hort ab&s;ence of one month (Septem|ber

<HEAD>From EDWARD GIBBON to Mrs. PORTEN.</HEAD>
<P>* * * Now for my&s;elf. As my father has given me leave to make a journey round Switzerland, we &s;et out to-morrow. Buy a map of Switzerland, it will co&s;t you but a &s;hilling, and follow me. I go by Iverdun, Neufchatel, Bienne or Biel, Soleurre or Solothurn, Bale or Ba&s;il, Bade, Zurich, Lucerne, and Bern. The voyage will be of about four weeks; &s;o that <HI>I hope to find a letter from you waiting for me.</HI> As my father had given me leave to learn what I had a mind, I have learned to ride, and learn actually to dance and draw. Be&s;ides that, I often give ten or twelve hours a day to my &s;tudies. I find a great many agree|able people here; &s;ee them &s;ometimes, and can &s;ay upon the whole, without vanity, that though I am the Engli&s;hman here who &s;pends the lea&s;t money, I am he who is the mo&s;t generally liked. I told you that my father had promi&s;ed to &s;end me into France and Italy. I have thanked him for it; but if he would follow my plan, he won't do it yet a while. I never liked young travellers; they go too raw to make and great remarks, and they lo&s;e a time which is (in my opinion) the mo&s;t precious part of a man's life. My &s;cheme would be, to &s;pend this winter at Lau&s;anne: for though it is a very good place to acquire the air of good company and the French tongue, we have no good profe&s;&s;ors. To &s;pend (I &s;ay) the winter at Lau&s;anne; go into England to &s;ee my friends a couple of months, and after that, fini&s;h my &s;tudies, either at Cambridge (for after what has pa&s;&s;ed one cannot think of Oxford), or at an univer&s;ity in Holland.

who &s;eek the &s;ublime beauties of nature. But the political
face of the country is not le&s;s diver&s;ified by the forms and &s;pirit of
&s;o many various republics, from the jealous government of the <HI>few</HI>
to the licentious freedom of the <HI>many.</HI> I contemplated with plea|&s;ure
the new pro&s;pects of men and manners; though my conver&s;a|tion
with the natives would have been more free and in&s;tructive, had
I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the German, as well as the French language. We pa&s;&s;ed
through mo&s;t of the principal towns of Switzerland; Neufch&acirc;tel,
Bienne, Soleurre, Arau, Baden, Zurich, Ba&s;il, and Bern. In
every place we vi&s;ited the churches, ar&s;enals, libraries, and all the
mo&s;t eminent per&s;ons; and after my return, I dige&s;ted my notes in
fourteen or fifteen &s;heets of a French journal, which I di&s;patched to
my father, as a proof that my time and his money had not been
mi&s;-&s;pent. Had I found this journal among his papers, I might be
tempted to &s;elect &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages; but I will not tran&s;cribe the printed
accounts, and it may be &s;ufficient to notice a remarkable &s;pot, which
left a deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on my memory. From Zurich
we proceeded to the Benedictine Abbey of Einfidlen, more com|monly
&s;tyled Our Lady of the Hermits. I was a&s;toni&s;hed by the
profu&s;e o&s;tentation of riches in the poore&s;t corner of Europe; amid&s;t
a &s;avage &s;cene of woods and mountains, a palace appears to have
been erected by magic; and it was erected by the potent magic of
religion. A crowd of palmers and votaries was pro&s;trate before the
altar. The title and wor&s;hip of the Mother of God provoked my
indignation; and the lively naked image of &s;uper&s;tition &s;ugge&s;ted
to me, as in the &s;ame place it had done to Zuinglius, the mo&s;t
pre&s;&s;ing argument for the reformation of the church. About two
years after this tour, I pa&s;&s;ed at Geneva a u&s;eful and agreeable
month; but this excur&s;ion, and &s;ome &s;hort vi&s;its in the Pais de
Vaud, did not materially interrupt my &s;tudious and &s;edentary life at
Lau&s;anne.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="95">
My thir&s;t of improvement, and the languid &s;tate of &s;cience at
Lau&s;anne, &s;oon prompted me to &s;olicit a literary corre&s;pondence
with &s;everal men of learning, whom I had not an opportunity of
per&s;onally con&s;ulting. 1. In the peru&s;al of Livy&punc; (xxx. 44.) I had
been &s;topped by a &s;entence in a &s;peech of Hannibal, which cannot be
reconciled by any torture with his character or argument. The
commentators di&s;&s;emble, or confe&s;s their perplexity. It occurred to
me, that the change of a &s;ingle letter, by &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>odio</HI> in&s;tead of
<HI>odio,</HI> might re&s;tore a clear and con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e; but I wi&s;hed to
weigh my emendation in &s;cales le&s;s partial than my own. I ad|dre&s;&s;ed
my&s;elf to M. Crevier<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letters, N^o I.</NOTE>, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Rollin, and a pro|fe&s;&s;or
in the univer&s;ity of Paris, who had publi&s;hed a large and va|luable
edition of Livy. His an&s;wer was &s;peedy and polite; he
prai&s;ed my ingenuity, and adopted my conjecture. 2. I main|tained
a Latin corre&s;pondence, at fir&s;t anonymous, and afterwards
in my own name, with Profe&s;&s;or Breitinger<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ditto, N^o IV. and V.</NOTE> of Zurich, the learned
editor of a Septuagint Bible. In our frequent letters we di&s;cu&s;&s;ed
many que&s;tions of antiquity, many pa&s;&s;ages of the Latin cla&s;&s;ics.
I propo&s;ed my interpretations and amendments. His cen&s;ures, for
he did not &s;pare my boldne&s;s of conjecture, were &s;harp and &s;trong;
and I was encouraged by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my &s;trength, when
I could &s;tand in free debate again&s;t a critic of &s;uch eminence
and erudition. 3. I corre&s;ponded on &s;imilar topics with the cele|brated
Profe&s;&s;or Matthew Ge&s;ner<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ditto, N^o VI. VII. and VIII.</NOTE>, of the univer&s;ity of Gottingen;
and he accepted, as courteou&s;ly as the two former, the invitation of
an unknown youth. But his abilities might po&s;&s;ibly be decayed; his
elaborate letters were feeble and prolix; and when I a&s;ked his proper
direction, the vain old man covered half a &s;heet of paper with the
fooli&s;h enumeration of his titles and offices. 4. The&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors of
Paris, Zurich, and Gottingen, were &s;trangers, whom I pre&s;umed to
<PB N="71" REF="96">
addre&s;s on the credit of their name; but Mr. Allamand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letters, N^o II. and III.</NOTE>, Mini&s;ter
at Bex, was my per&s;onal friend, with whom I maintained a more
free and intere&s;ting corre&s;pondence. He was a ma&s;ter of language,
of &s;cience, and, above all, of di&s;pute; and his acute and flexible
logic could &s;upport, with equal addre&s;s, and perhaps with equal in|difference,
the adver&s;e &s;ides of every po&s;&s;ible que&s;tion. His &s;pirit
was active, but his pen had been indolent. Mr. Allamand had ex|po&s;ed
him&s;elf to much &s;candal and reproach, by an anonymous letter
(1745) to the Prote&s;tants of France; in which he labours to per|&s;uade
them that <HI>public</HI> wor&s;hip is the exclu&s;ive right and duty of the
&s;tate, and that their numerous a&s;&s;emblies of di&s;&s;enters and rebels were
not authori&s;ed by the law or the go&s;pel. His &s;tyle is animated, his
arguments &s;pecious; and if the papi&s;t may &s;eem to lurk under the
ma&s;k of a prote&s;tant, the philo&s;opher is concealed under the di&s;gui&s;e
of a papi&s;t. After &s;ome trials in France and Holland, which were
defeated by his fortune or his character, a genius that might have
enlightened or deluded the world, was buried in a country living,
unknown to fame, and di&s;contented with mankind. <HI>E&s;t &s;acrificulus
in pago, et ru&s;ticos decipit.</HI> As often as private or eccle&s;ia&s;tical bu&s;ine&s;s
called him to Lau&s;anne, I enjoyed the plea&s;ure and benefit of his
conver&s;ation, and we were mutually flattered by our attention to
each other. Our corre&s;pondence, in his ab&s;ence, chiefly turned
on Locke's metaphy&s;ics, which he attacked, and I defended; the
origin of ideas, the principles of evidence, and the doctrine of
liberty;
<Q>And found no end, in wandering mazes lo&s;t.</Q>
By fencing with &s;o &s;kilful a ma&s;ter, I acquired &s;ome dexterity in the
u&s;e of my philo&s;ophic weapons; but I was &s;till the &s;lave of edu|cation
and prejudice. He had &s;ome mea&s;ures to keep; and I much
<PB N="72" REF="97">
&s;u&s;pect that he never &s;hewed me the true colours of his &s;ecret
&s;ceptici&s;m.</P>
<P>Before I was recalled from Switzerland, I had the &s;atisfaction of
&s;eeing the mo&s;t extraordinary man of the age; a poet, an hi&s;torian,
a philo&s;opher, who has filled thirty quartos, of pro&s;e and ver&s;e, with
his various productions, often excellent, and always entertaining.
Need I add the name of Voltaire? After forfeiting, by his own
mi&s;conduct, the friend&s;hip of the fir&s;t of kings, he retired, at the age
of &s;ixty, with a plentiful fortune, to a free and beautiful country,
and re&s;ided two winters (1757 and 1758) in the town or neigh|bourhood
of Lau&s;anne. My de&s;ire of beholding Voltaire, whom I
then rated above his real magnitude, was ea&s;ily gratified. He re|ceived
me with civility as an Engli&s;h youth; but I cannot boa&s;t
of any peculiar notice or di&s;tinction, <HI>Virgilium vidi tantum.</HI></P>
<P>The ode which he compo&s;ed on his fir&s;t arrival on the banks of
the Leman Lake, <HI>O Mai&s;on d' Ari&s;tippe! O Jardin d'Epicure, &amp;c.</HI>
had been imparted as a &s;ecret to the gentleman by whom I was in|troduced.
He allowed me to read it twice; I knew it by heart;
and as my di&s;cretion was not equal to my memory, the author was
&s;oon di&s;plea&s;ed by the circulation of a copy. In writing this trivial
anecdote, I wi&s;hed to ob&s;erve whether my memory was impaired,
and I have the comfort of finding that every line of the poem is
&s;till engraved in fre&s;h and indelible characters. The highe&s;t grati|fication
which I derived from Voltaire's re&s;idence at Lau&s;anne, was
the uncommon circum&s;tance of hearing a great poet declaim his own
productions on the &s;tage. He had formed a company of gentle|men
and ladies, &s;ome of whom were not de&s;titute of talents. A
decent theatre was framed at Monrepos, a country-hou&s;e at the end
of a &s;uburb; dre&s;&s;es and &s;cenes were provided at the expence of the
actors; and the author directed the rehear&s;als with the zeal and at|tention
of paternal love. In two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive winters his tragedies of
Zayre, Alzire, Zulime, and his &s;entimental comedy of the Enfant
<PB N="73" REF="98">
Prodigue, were played at the theatre of Monrepos. Voltaire re|pre&s;ented
the characters be&s;t adapted to his years, Lu&s;ignan, Al|var&eacute;z,
Bena&s;&s;ar, Euphemon. His declamation was fa&s;hioned to the
pomp and cadence of the old &s;tage; and he expre&s;&s;ed the enthu&s;ia&s;m
of poetry, rather than the feelings of nature. My ardour, which
&s;oon became con&s;picuous, &s;eldom failed of procuring me a ticket.
The habits of plea&s;ure fortified my ta&s;te for the French theatre, and
that ta&s;te has perhaps abated my idolatry for the gigantic genius of
Shake&s;peare, which is inculcated from our infancy as the fir&s;t duty
of an Engli&s;hman. The wit and philo&s;ophy of Voltaire, his table
and theatre, refined, in a vi&s;ible degree, the manners of Lau&s;anne;
and, however addicted to &s;tudy, I enjoyed my &s;hare of the amu&s;e|ments
of &s;ociety. After the repre&s;entation of Monrepos I &s;ome|times
&s;upped with the actors. I was now familiar in &s;ome, and ac|quainted
in many hou&s;es; and my evenings were generally devoted
to cards and conver&s;ation, either in private parties or numerous
a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>I he&s;itate, from the apprehen&s;ion of ridicule, when I approach
the delicate &s;ubject of my early love. By this word I do not mean
the polite attention, the gallantry, without hope or de&s;ign, which
has originated in the &s;pirit of chivalry, and is interwoven with
the texture of French manners. I under&s;tand by this pa&s;&s;ion the
union of de&s;ire, friend&s;hip, and tenderne&s;s, which is inflamed by
a &s;ingle female, which prefers her to the re&s;t of her &s;ex, and which
&s;eeks her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as the &s;upreme or the &s;ole happine&s;s of our
being. I need not blu&s;h at recollecting the object of my choice;
and though my love was di&s;appointed of &s;ucce&s;s, I am rather proud
that I was once capable of feeling &s;uch a pure and exalted &s;entiment.
The per&s;onal attractions of Mademoi&s;elle Su&s;an Curchod were em|belli&s;hed
by the virtues and talents of the mind. Her fortune was
humble, but her family was re&s;pectable. Her mother, a native of
France, had preferred her religion to her country. The profe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="74" REF="99">
of her father did not extingui&s;h the moderation and philo&s;ophy of
his temper, and he lived content with a &s;mall &s;alary and laborious

In the &s;olitude of a &s;eque&s;tered village he be&s;towed a liberal, and
even learned, education on his only daughter. She &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his
hopes by her proficiency in the &s;ciences and languages; and in her
&s;hort vi&s;its to &s;ome relations at Lau&s;anne, the wit, the beauty, and
erudition of Mademoi&s;elle Curchod were the theme of univer&s;al ap|plau&s;e.
The report of &s;uch a prodigy awakened my curio&s;ity; I
&s;aw and loved. I found her learned without pedantry, lively in
conver&s;ation, pure in &s;entiment, and elegant in manners; and the
fir&s;t &s;udden emotion was fortified by the habits and knowledge of
a more familiar acquaintance. She permitted me to make her two
or three vi&s;its at her father's hou&s;e. I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome happy days
there, in the mountains of Burgundy, and her parents honourably
encouraged the connection. In a calm retirement the gay vanity of
<PB N="75" REF="100">
youth no longer fluttered in her bo&s;om; &s;he li&s;tened to the voice
of truth and pa&s;&s;ion, and I might pre&s;ume to hope that I had made
&s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on a virtuous heart. At Cra&s;&s;y and Lau&s;anne I in|dulged
my dream of felicity: but on my return to England, I &s;oon
di&s;covered that my father would not hear of this &s;trange alliance,
and that without his con&s;ent I was my&s;elf de&s;titute and helple&s;s.
After a painful &s;truggle I yielded to my fate: I &s;ighed as a lover, I
obeyed as a &s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Oeuvres de Rou&s;&s;eau, tom. xxxiii. p. 88, 89. octavo edition. As an author I &s;hall not appeal from the judgment, or ta&s;te, or caprice of <HI>Jean Jaques:</HI> but that extraordinary man, whom I admire and pity, &s;hould have been le&s;s precipitate in con|demning the moral character and conduct of a &s;tranger.</NOTE>; my wound was in&s;en&s;ibly healed by time, ab|&s;ence,
and the habits of a new life. My cure was accelerated by
a faithful report of the tranquillity and cheerfulne&s;s of the lady her|&s;elf,
and my love &s;ub&s;ided in friend&s;hip and e&s;teem. The mini&s;ter of
Cra&s;&s;y &s;oon afterwards died; his &s;tipend died with him: his daughter
retired to Geneva, where, by teaching young ladies, &s;he earned a
hard &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for her&s;elf and her mother; but in her lowe&s;t
di&s;tre&s;s &s;he maintained a &s;potle&s;s reputation, and a dignified behaviour.
A rich banker of Paris, a citizen of Geneva, had the good fortune
and good &s;en&s;e to di&s;cover and po&s;&s;e&s;s this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure; and
in the capital of ta&s;te and luxury &s;he re&s;i&s;ted the temptations of
wealth, as &s;he had &s;u&s;tained the hard&s;hips of indigence. The ge|nius
of her hu&s;band has exalted him to the mo&s;t con&s;picuous &s;tation
in Europe. In every change of pro&s;perity and di&s;grace he has re|clined
on the bo&s;om of a faithful friend; and Mademoi&s;elle Curchod
is now the wife of M. Necker, the mini&s;ter, and perhaps the legi|&s;lator,
of the French monarchy.</P>
<P>What&s;oever have been the fruits of my education, they mu&s;t be
a&s;cribed to the fortunate bani&s;hment which placed me at Lau&s;anne.
I have &s;ometimes applied to my own fate the ver&s;es of Pindar, which
remind an Olympic champion that his victory was the con&s;equence

<P>If my childi&s;h revolt again&s;t the religion of my country had not
&s;tripped me in time of my academic gown, the five important years,
&s;o liberally improved in the &s;tudies and conver&s;ation of Lau&s;anne,
would have been &s;teeped in port and prejudice among the monks of
Oxford. Had the fatigue of idlene&s;s compelled me to read, the
path of learning would not have been enlightened by a ray of phi|lo&s;ophic
freedom. I &s;hould have grown to manhood ignorant of
the life and language of Europe, and my knowledge of the world
would have been confined to an Engli&s;h cloi&s;ter. But my religious
error fixed me at Lau&s;anne, in a &s;tate of bani&s;hment and di&s;grace.
The rigid cour&s;e of di&s;cipline and ab&s;tinence, to which I was con|demned,
invigorated the con&s;titution of my mind and body; poverty
and pride e&s;tranged me from my countrymen. One mi&s;chief, how|ever,
and in their eyes a &s;erious and irreparable mi&s;chief, was de|rived
from the &s;ucce&s;s of my Swi&s;s education: I had cea&s;ed to be an
Engli&s;hman. At the flexible period of youth, from the age of &s;ix|teen
to twenty-one, my opinions, habits, and &s;entiments were ca&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="102">
in a foreign mould; the faint and di&s;tant remembrance of Eng|land
was almo&s;t obliterated; my native language was grown le&s;s
familiar; and I &s;hould have cheerfully accepted the offer of a
moderate independence on the terms of perpetual exile. By the
good &s;en&s;e and temper of Pavilliard my yoke was in&s;en&s;ibly light|ened:
he left me ma&s;ter of my time and actions; but he could
neither change my &s;ituation, nor increa&s;e my allowance, and with
the progre&s;s of my years and rea&s;on I impatiently &s;ighed for the
moment of my deliverance. At length, in the Spring of the year
one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-eight, my father &s;ignified his
permi&s;&s;ion and his plea&s;ure that I &s;hould immediately return home.
We were then in the mid&s;t of a war: the re&s;entment of the French
at our taking their &s;hips without a declaration, had rendered that
polite nation &s;omewhat peevi&s;h and difficult. They denied a pa&s;&s;age
to Engli&s;h travellers, and the road through Germany was circuitous,
toil&s;ome, and perhaps in the neighbourhood of the armies, expo&s;ed
to &s;ome danger. In this perplexity, two Swi&s;s officers of my ac|quaintance
in the Dutch &s;ervice, who were returning to their gar|ri&s;ons,
offered to conduct me through France as one of their com|panions;
nor did we &s;ufficiently reflect that my borrowed name and
regimentals might have been con&s;idered, in ca&s;e of a di&s;covery, in a
very &s;erious light. I took my leave of Lau&s;anne on the 11th of
April 1758, with a mixture of joy and regret, in the firm re&s;olu|tion
of revi&s;iting, as a man, the per&s;ons and places which had been
&s;o dear to my youth. We travelled &s;lowly, but plea&s;antly, in a
hired coach, over the hills of Franche-compt&eacute; and the fertile pro|vince
of Lorraine, and pa&s;&s;ed, without accident or inquiry, through
&s;everal fortified towns of the French frontier: from thence we en|tered
the wild Ardennes of the Au&s;trian dutchy of Luxemburg;
and after cro&s;&s;ing the Meu&s;e at Liege, we traver&s;ed the heaths of
Brabant, and reached, on the fifteenth day, our Dutch garri&s;on of
Bois le Duc. In our pa&s;&s;age through Nancy, my eye was gratified
by the a&s;pect of a regular and beautiful city, the work of Stani&s;laus,
<PB N="78" REF="103">
who, after the &s;torms of Poli&s;h royalty, repo&s;ed in the love and
gratitude of his new &s;ubjects of Lorraine. In our halt at Mae&s;tricht
I vi&s;ited Mr. de Beaufort, a learned critic, who was known to me by
his &s;pecious arguments again&s;t the five fir&s;t centuries of the Roman
Hi&s;tory. After dropping my regimental companions, I &s;tepped
a&s;ide to vi&s;it Rotterdam and the Hague. I wi&s;hed to have ob&s;erved
a country, the monument of freedom and indu&s;try; but my days
were numbered, and a longer delay would have been ungraceful. I
ha&s;tened to embark at the Brill, landed the next day at Harwich,
and proceeded to London, where my father awaited my arrival.
The whole term of my fir&s;t ab&s;ence from England was four years
ten months and fifteen days.</P>
<P>In the prayers of the church our per&s;onal concerns are judiciou&s;ly
reduced to the threefold di&s;tinction of <HI>mind, body,</HI> and <HI>e&s;tate.</HI> The
&s;entiments of the mind excite and exerci&s;e our &s;ocial &s;ympathy.
The review of my moral and literary character is the mo&s;t intere&s;t|ing
to my&s;elf and to the public; and I may expatiate, without re|proach,
on my private &s;tudies; &s;ince they have produced the publc
writings, which can alone entitle me to the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of
my readers. The experience of the world inculcates a di&s;creet re|&s;erve
on the &s;ubject of our per&s;on and e&s;tate, and we &s;oon learn
that a free di&s;clo&s;ure of our riches or poverty would provoke the
malice of envy, or encourage the in&s;olence of contempt.</P>
<P>The only per&s;on in England whom I was impatient to &s;ee was
my aunt Porten, the affectionate guardian of my tender years. I
ha&s;tened to her hou&s;e in College-&s;treet, We&s;tmin&s;ter; and the even|ing
was &s;pent in the effu&s;ions of joy and confidence. It was not
without &s;ome awe and apprehen&s;ion that I approached the pre&s;ence
of my father. My infancy, to &s;peak the truth, had been neglected
at home; the &s;everity of his look and language at our la&s;t parting
&s;till dwelt on my memory; nor could I form any notion of his cha|racter,
or my probable reception. They were both more agreeable
than I could expect. The dome&s;tic di&s;cipline of our ance&s;tors has
<PB N="79" REF="104">
been relaxed by the philo&s;ophy and &s;oftne&s;s of the age; and if my
father remembered that he had trembled before a &s;tern parent, it was
only to adopt with his own &s;on an oppo&s;ite mode of behaviour.
He received me as a man and a friend; all con&s;traint was bani&s;hed
at our fir&s;t interview, and we ever afterwards continued on the &s;ame
terms of ea&s;y and equal politene&s;s. He applauded the &s;ucce&s;s of
my education; every word and action was expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t
cordial affection; and our lives would have pa&s;&s;ed without a cloud,
if his oeconomy had been equal to his fortune, or if his fortune had
been equal to his de&s;ires. During my ab&s;ence he had married his
&s;econd wife, Mi&s;s Dorothea Patton, who was introduced to me with
the mo&s;t unfavourable prejudice. I con&s;idered his &s;econd marriage
as an act of di&s;plea&s;ure, and I was di&s;po&s;ed to hate the rival of my
mother. But the inju&s;tice was in my own fancy, and the imaginary
mon&s;ter was an amiable and de&s;erving woman. I could not be mi&s;|taken
in the fir&s;t view of her under&s;tanding, her knowledge, and
the elegant &s;pirit of her conver&s;ation: her polite welcome, and her
a&s;&s;iduous care to &s;tudy and gratify my wi&s;hes, announced at lea&s;t
that the &s;urface would be &s;mooth; and my &s;u&s;picions of art and
fal&s;ehood were gradually di&s;pelled by the full di&s;covery of her warm
and exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility. After &s;ome re&s;erve on my &s;ide, our minds
a&s;&s;ociated in confidence and friend&s;hip; and as Mrs. Gibbon had
neither children nor the hopes of children, we more ea&s;ily adopted
the tender names and genuine characters of mother and of &s;on.
By the indulgence of the&s;e parents, I was left at liberty to con&s;ult
my ta&s;te or rea&s;on in the choice of place, of company, and of
amu&s;ements; and my excur&s;ions were bounded only by the limits
of the i&s;land, and the mea&s;ure of my income. Some faint efforts
were made to procure me the employment of &s;ecretary to a foreign
emba&s;&s;y; and I li&s;tened to a &s;cheme which would again have tran&s;|ported
me to the continent. Mrs. Gibbon, with &s;eeming wi&s;dom,
exhorted me to take chambers in the Temple, and devote my lei&s;ure
to the &s;tudy of the law. I cannot repent of having neglected her
<PB N="80" REF="105">
advice. Few men, without the &s;pur of nece&s;&s;ity, have re&s;olution
to force their way through the thorns and thickets of that gloomy
labyrinth. Nature had not endowed me with the bold and ready
eloquence which makes it&s;elf heard amid&s;t the tumult of the bar;
and I &s;hould probably have been diverted from the labours of lite|rature,
without acquiring the fame or fortune of a &s;ucce&s;sful pleader.
I had no need to call to my aid the regular duties of a profe&s;&s;ion;
every day, every hour, was agreeably filled; nor have I known,
like &s;o many of my countrymen, the tediou&s;ne&s;s of an idle life.</P>
<P>Of the two years (May 1758&mdash;May 1760,) between my return
to England and the embodying of the Hamp&s;hire militia, I pa&s;&s;ed
about nine months in London, and the remainder in the country.
The metropolis affords many amu&s;ements, which are open to all.
It is it&s;elf an a&s;toni&s;hing and perpetual &s;pectacle to the curious eye;
and each ta&s;te, each &s;en&s;e may be gratified by the variety of objects
which will occur in the long circuit of a morning walk. I a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly
frequented the theatres at a very propitious aera of the &s;tage, when
a con&s;tellation of excellent actors, both in tragedy and comedy, was
eclip&s;ed by the meridian brightne&s;s of Garrick in the maturity of
his judgement, and vigour of his performance. The plea&s;ures of a
town-life are within the reach of every man who is regardle&s;s of his
health, his money, and his company. By the contagion of ex|ample
I was &s;ometimes &s;educed; but the better habits, which I had
formed at Lau&s;anne, induced me to &s;eek a more elegant and rational
&s;ociety; and if my &s;earch was le&s;s ea&s;y and &s;ucce&s;sful than I might
have hoped, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent impute the failure to the di&s;advantages
of my &s;ituation and character. Had the rank and fortune of my
parents given them an annual e&s;tabli&s;hment in London, their own
hou&s;e would have introduced me to a numerous and polite circle of
acquaintance. But my father's ta&s;te had always preferred the highe&s;t
and the lowe&s;t company, for which he was equally qualified; and after
a twelve years retirement, he was no longer in the memory of the
great with whom he had a&s;&s;ociated. I found my&s;elf a &s;tranger in
<PB N="81" REF="106">
the mid&s;t of a va&s;t and unknown city; and at my entrance into life
I was reduced to &s;ome dull family parties, and &s;ome &s;cattered con|nections,
which were not &s;uch as I &s;hould have cho&s;en for my&s;elf.
The mo&s;t u&s;eful friends of my father were the Mallets: they re|ceived
me with civility and kindne&s;s at fir&s;t on his account, and af|terwards
on my own; and (if I may u&s;e Lord Che&s;terfield's words)
I was &s;oon <HI>dome&s;ticated</HI> in their hou&s;e. Mr. Mallet, a name among
the Engli&s;h poets, is prai&s;ed by an unforgiving enemy, for the ea&s;e
and elegance of his conver&s;ation, and his wife was not de&s;titute of
wit or learning. By his a&s;&s;i&s;tance I was introduced to lady Hervey,
the mother of the pre&s;ent earl of Bri&s;tol. Her age and infirmities
confined her at home; her dinners were &s;elect; in the evening her
hou&s;e was open to the be&s;t company of both &s;exes and all nations;
nor was I di&s;plea&s;ed at her preference and affectation of the manners,
the language, and the literature of France. But my progre&s;s in the
Engli&s;h world was in general left to my own efforts, and tho&s;e efforts
were languid and &s;low. I had not been endowed by art or nature
with tho&s;e happy gifts of confidence and addre&s;s, which unlock
every door and every bo&s;om; nor would it be rea&s;onable to com|plain
of the ju&s;t con&s;equences of my &s;ickly childhood, foreign edu|cation,
and re&s;erved temper. While coaches were rattling through
Bond-&s;treet, I have pa&s;&s;ed many a &s;olitary evening in my lodging
with my books. My &s;tudies were &s;ometimes interrupted by a &s;igh,
which I breathed towards Lau&s;anne; and on the approach of Spring,
I withdrew without reluctance from the noi&s;y and exten&s;ive &s;cene
of crowds without company, and di&s;&s;ipation without plea&s;ure. In
each of the twenty-five years of my acquaintance with London
(1758&mdash;1783) the pro&s;pect gradually brightened; and this unfa|vourable
picture mo&s;t properly belongs to the fir&s;t period after my
return from Switzerland.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="107">
My father's re&s;idence in Hamp&s;hire, where I have pa&s;&s;ed many
light, and &s;ome heavy hours, was at Buriton, near Peters&s;ield, one
mile from the Port&s;mouth road, and at the ea&s;y di&s;tance of fifty-eight
miles from London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The e&s;tate and maner of Beriton, otherwi&s;e Buriton, were con&s;iderable, and were &s;old a few years ago to Lord Stawell. S.</NOTE> An old man&s;ion, in a &s;tate of decay,
had been converted into the fa&s;hion and convenience of a modern
hou&s;e: and if &s;trangers had nothing to &s;ee, the inhabitants had little
to de&s;ire. The &s;pot was not happily cho&s;en, at the end of the vil|lage
and the bottom of the hill: but the a&s;pect of the adjacent
grounds was various and cheerful; the downs commanded a noble
pro&s;pect, and the long hanging woods in &s;ight of the hou&s;e could
not perhaps have been improved by art or expence. My father
kept in his own hands the whole of the e&s;tate, and even rented
&s;ome additional land; and what&s;oever might be the balance of profit
and lo&s;s, the farm &s;upplied him with amu&s;ement and plenty. The
produce maintained a number of men and hor&s;es, which were mul|tiplied
by the intermixture of dome&s;tic and rural &s;ervants; and in
the intervals of labour the favourite team, a hand&s;ome &s;et of bays
or greys, was harne&s;&s;ed to the coach. The oeconomy of the hou&s;e
was regulated by the ta&s;te and prudence of Mrs. Gibbon. She
prided her&s;elf in the elegance of her occa&s;ional dinners; and from
the uncleanly avarice of Madame Pavilliard, I was &s;uddenly tran&s;|ported
to the daily neatne&s;s and luxury of an Engli&s;h table. Our
immediate neighbourhood was rare and ru&s;tic; but from the verge of
our hills, as far as Chiche&s;ter and Goodwood, the we&s;tern di&s;trict of
Su&s;&s;ex was inter&s;per&s;ed with noble &s;eats and ho&s;pitable families, with
whom we cultivated a friendly, and might have enjoyed a very fre|quent,
intercour&s;e. As my &s;tay at Buriton was always voluntary, I
was received and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with &s;milies; but the comforts of my retire|ment
did not depend on the ordinary plea&s;ures of the country. My
<PB N="83" REF="108">
father could never in&s;pire me with his love and knowledge of farm|ing.
I never handled a gun, I &s;eldom mounted an hor&s;e; and
my philo&s;ophic walks were &s;oon terminated by a &s;hady bench, where
I was long detained by the &s;edentary amu&s;ement of reading or me|ditation.
At home I occupied a plea&s;ant and &s;pacious apartment;
the library on the &s;ame floor was &s;oon con&s;idered as my peculiar do|main;
and I might &s;ay with truth, that I was never le&s;s alone than
when by my&s;elf. My &s;ole complaint, which I piou&s;ly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed,
aro&s;e from the kind re&s;traint impo&s;ed on the freedom of my time.
By the habit of early ri&s;ing I always &s;ecured a &s;acred portion of the
day, and many &s;cattered moments were &s;tolen and employed by my
&s;tudious indu&s;try. But the family hours of breakfa&s;t, of dinner,
of tea, and of &s;upper, were regular and long; after breakfa&s;t Mrs.
Gibbon expected my company in her dre&s;&s;ing-room; after tea my
father claimed my conver&s;ation and the peru&s;al of the new&s;papers;
and in the mid&s;t of an intere&s;ting work I was often called down to
receive the vi&s;it of &s;ome idle neighbours. Their dinners and vi&s;its
required, in due &s;ea&s;on, a &s;imilar return; and I dreaded the period
of the full moon, which was u&s;ually re&s;erved for our more di&s;tant
excur&s;ions. I could not refu&s;e attending my father, in the &s;ummer
of 1759, to the races at Stockbridge, Reading, and Odiam, where
he had entered a hor&s;e for the hunter's plate; and I was not
di&s;plea&s;ed with the &s;ight of our Olympic games, the beauty of
the &s;pot, the fleetne&s;s of the hor&s;es, and the gay tumult of the
numerous &s;pectators. As &s;oon as the militia bu&s;ine&s;s was agi|tated,
many days were tediou&s;ly con&s;umed in meetings of deputy-lieutenants
at Petersfield, Alton, and Winche&s;ter. In the clo&s;e of
the &s;ame year, 1759, Sir Simeon (then Mr.) Stewart attempted
an un&s;ucce&s;sful conte&s;t for the county of Southampton, again&s;t
Mr. Legge, Chancellor of the Exchequer: a well-known conte&s;t,
in which Lord Bute's influence was fir&s;t exerted and cen&s;ured.
Our canvas at Port&s;mouth and Go&s;port la&s;ted &s;everal days; but
<PB N="84" REF="109">
the interruption of my &s;tudies was compen&s;ated in &s;ome degree by
the &s;pectacle of Engli&s;h manners, and the acqui&s;ition of &s;ome prac|tical
knowledge.</P>
<P>If in a more dome&s;tic or more di&s;&s;ipated &s;cene my application was
&s;omewhat relaxed, the love of knowledge was inflamed and gratified
by the command of books; and I compared the poverty of Lau&s;anne
with the plenty of London. My father's &s;tudy at Buriton was
&s;tuffed with much tra&s;h of the la&s;t age, with much high church
divinity and politics, which have long &s;ince gone to their proper
place: yet it contained &s;ome valuable editions of the cla&s;&s;ics and the
fathers, the choice, as it &s;hould &s;eem, of Mr. Law; and many
Engli&s;h publications of the times had been occa&s;ionally added.
From this &s;lender beginning I have gradually formed a numerous
and &s;elect library, the foundation of my works, and the be&s;t com|fort
of my life, both at home and abroad. On the receipt of the
fir&s;t quarter, a large &s;hare of my allowance was appropriated to my
literary wants. I cannot forget the joy with which I exchanged
a bank-note of twenty pounds for the twenty volumes of the Me|moirs
of the Academy of In&s;criptions; nor would it have been ea&s;y,
by any other expenditure of the &s;ame &s;um, to have procured &s;o large
and la&s;ting a fund of rational amu&s;ement. At a time when I mo&s;t
a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly frequented this &s;chool of antient literature, I thus ex|pre&s;&s;ed
my opinion of a learned and various collection, which &s;ince
the year 1759 has been doubled in magnitude, though not in merit&mdash;
<Q>Une de ces &s;ociet&eacute;s, qui ont mieux immortali&s;&eacute; Louis XIV. qu'un

ne cede qu'&agrave; peine aux decouvertes, une <HI>ignorance</HI> mode&s;te et
<HI>&s;avante.</HI></Q> The review of my library mu&s;t be re&s;erved for the
period of its maturity; but in this place I may allow my&s;elf to ob|&s;erve,
that I am not con&s;cious of having ever bought a book from a
<PB N="85" REF="110">
motive of o&s;tentation, that every volume, before it was depo&s;ited on
the &s;helf, was either read or &s;ufficiently examined, and that I &s;oon
adopted the tolerating maxim of the elder Pliny, <Q>nullum e&s;&s;e
librum tam malum ut non ex aliqu&acirc; parte prode&s;&s;et.</Q> I could not
yet find lei&s;ure or courage to renew the pur&s;uit of the Greek lan|guage,
excepting by reading the le&s;&s;ons of the Old and New Te&s;tament
every Sunday, when I attended the family to church. The &s;eries of
my Latin authors was le&s;s &s;trenuou&s;ly completed; but the acqui&s;i|tion,
by inheritance or purcha&s;e, of the be&s;t editions of Cicero,
Quintilian, Livy, Tacitus, Ovid, &amp;c. afforded a fair pro&s;pect, which
I &s;eldom neglected. I per&s;evered in the u&s;eful method of ab&s;tracts
and ob&s;ervations; and a &s;ingle example may &s;uffice, of a note which
had almo&s;t &s;welled into a work. The &s;olution of a pa&s;&s;age of Livy
(xxxviii. 38.) involved me in the dry and dark treati&s;es of Greaves,
Arbuthnot, Hooper, Bernard, Ei&s;en&s;chmidt, Gronovius, La Barr&eacute;,
Freret, &amp;c; and in my French e&s;&s;ay (chap. 20.) I ridiculou&s;ly &s;end
the reader to my own <HI>manu&s;cript</HI> remarks on the weights, coins, and
mea&s;ures of the ancients, which were abruptly terminated by the
militia drum.</P>
<P>As I am now entering on a more ample field of &s;ociety and
&s;tudy, I can only hope to avoid a vain and prolix garrulity, by over|looking
the vulgar crowd of my acquaintance, and confining my&s;elf
to &s;uch intimate friends among books and men, as are be&s;t entitled to
my notice by their own merit and reputation, or by the deep im|pre&s;&s;ion
which they have left on my mind. Yet I will embrace this
occa&s;ion of recommending to the young &s;tudent a practice, which
about this time I my&s;elf adopted. After glancing my eye over the
de&s;ign and order of a new book, I &s;u&s;pended the peru&s;al till I had
fini&s;hed the ta&s;k of &s;elf-examination, till I had revolved, in a &s;olitary
walk, all that I knew or believed, or had thought on the &s;ubject
of the whole work, or of &s;ome particular chapter: I was then quali|fied
to di&s;cern how much the author added to my original &s;tock; and
<PB N="86" REF="111">
I was &s;ometimes &s;atisfied by the agreement, I was &s;ometimes armed
by the oppo&s;ition, of our ideas. The favourite companions of my
lei&s;ure were our Engli&s;h writers &s;ince the Revolution: they breathe
the &s;pirit of rea&s;on and liberty; and they mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onably contributed
to re&s;tore the purity of my own language, which had been corrupted
by the long u&s;e of a foreign idiom. By the judicious advice of Mr.
Mallet, I was directed to the writings of Swift and Addi&s;on; wit and
&s;implicity are their common attributes: but the &s;tyle of Swift is &s;up|ported
by manly original vigour; that of Addi&s;on is adorned by the
female graces of elegance and mildne&s;s. The old reproach, that no
Briti&s;h altars had been rai&s;ed to the mu&s;e of hi&s;tory, was recently di&s;|proved
by the fir&s;t performances of Robert&s;on and Hume, the hi&s;|tories
of Scotland and of the Stuarts. I will a&s;&s;ume the pre&s;umption
of &s;aying, that I was not unworthy to read them: nor will I di&s;gui&s;e
my different feelings in the repeated peru&s;als. The perfect compo&s;i|tion,
the nervous language, the well-turned periods of Dr. Robert|&s;on,
inflamed me to the ambitious hope that I might one day tread
in his foot&s;teps: the calm philo&s;ophy, the carele&s;s inimitable beauties
of his friend and rival, often forced me to clo&s;e the volume with a
mixed &s;en&s;ation of delight and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of my fir&s;t work, the E&s;&s;ay on the Study of Literature,
was &s;ugge&s;ted by a refinement of vanity, the de&s;ire of ju&s;tifying and
prai&s;ing the object of a favourite pur&s;uit. In France, to which my
ideas were confined, the learning and language of Greece and Rome
were neglected by a philo&s;ophic age. The guardian of tho&s;e &s;tudies,
the Academy of In&s;criptions, was degraded to the lowe&s;t rank among
the three royal &s;ocieties of Paris: the new appellation of Erudits
was contemptuou&s;ly applied to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Lip&s;ius and Ca&s;au|bon;
and I was provoked to hear (&s;ee M. d'Alembert Di&s;cours pre|liminaire
&agrave; l'Encyclopedie) that the exerci&s;e of the memory, their
&s;ole merit, had been &s;uper&s;eded by the nobler faculties of the imagi|nation
and the judgment. I was ambitious of proving by my own
<PB N="87" REF="112">
example, as well as by my precepts, that all the faculties of the mind
may be exerci&s;ed and di&s;played by the &s;tudy of ancient literature: I
began to &s;elect and adorn the various proofs and illu&s;trations which
had offered them&s;elves in reading the cla&s;&s;ics; and the fir&s;t pages or
chapters of my e&s;&s;ay were compo&s;ed before my departure from
Lau&s;anne. The hurry of the journey, and of the fir&s;t weeks of my
Engli&s;h life, &s;u&s;pended all thoughts of &s;erious application: but my
object was ever before my eyes; and no more than ten days, from
the fir&s;t to the eleventh of July, were &s;uffered to elap&s;e after my
&s;ummer e&s;tabli&s;hment at Buriton. My e&s;&s;ay was fini&s;hed in about
&s;ix weeks; and as &s;oon as a fair copy had been tran&s;cribed by one of
the French pri&s;oners at Peters&s;ield, I looked round for a critic and
judge of my fir&s;t performance. A writer can &s;eldom be content with
the doubtful recompence of &s;olitary approbation; but a youth igno|rant
of the world, and of him&s;elf, mu&s;t de&s;ire to weigh his talents in
&s;ome &s;cales le&s;s partial than his own: my conduct was natural, my
motive laudable, my choice of Dr. Maty judicious and fortunate.
By de&s;cent and education Dr. Maty, though born in Holland, might
be con&s;idered as a Frenchman; but he was fixed in London by the
practice of phy&s;ic, and an office in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum. His repu|tation
was ju&s;tly founded on the eighteen volumes of the <HI>Journal
Britannique,</HI> which he had &s;upported, almo&s;t alone, with per&s;everance
and &s;ucce&s;s. This humble though u&s;eful labour, which had once
been digni&s;ied by the genius of Bayle and the learning of Le Clerc,
was not di&s;graced by the ta&s;te, the knowledge, and the judgment of
Maty: he exhibits a candid and plea&s;ing view of the &s;tate of litera|ture
in England during a period of &s;ix years (January 1750&mdash;De|cember
1755); and, far different from his angry &s;on, he handles the
rod of critici&s;m with the tenderne&s;s and reluctance of a parent. The
author of the <HI>Journal Britannique</HI> &s;ometimes a&s;pires to the character
of a poet and philo&s;opher: his &s;tyle is pure and elegant; and in his
virtues, or even in his defects, he may be ranked as one of the la&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="113">
di&s;ciples of the &s;chool of Fontenelle. His an&s;wer to my fir&s;t letter
was prompt and polite: after a careful examination he returned my
manu&s;cript, with &s;ome animadver&s;ion and much applau&s;e; and when
I vi&s;ited London in the en&s;uing winter, we di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the de&s;ign and
execution in &s;everal free and familiar conver&s;ations. In a &s;hort ex|cur&s;ion
to Buriton I reviewed my e&s;&s;ay, according to his friendly ad|vice;
and after &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a third, adding a third, and altering a
third, I con&s;ummated my fir&s;t labour by a &s;hort preface, which is
dated February 3d, 1759. Yet I &s;till &s;hrunk from the pre&s;s with
the terrors of virgin mode&s;ty: the manu&s;cript was &s;afely depo&s;ited in
my de&s;k; and as my attention was engaged by new objects, the
delay might have been prolonged till I had fulfilled the precept of
Horace, <Q>nonumque prematur in annum.</Q> Father Sirmond, a
learned je&s;uit, was &s;till more rigid, &s;ince he advi&s;ed a young friend
to expect the mature age of fifty, before he gave him&s;elf or his writ|ings
to the public (Olivet Hi&s;toire de l'Academie Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e, tom. ii.
p. 143.). The coun&s;el was &s;ingular; but it is &s;till more &s;ingular that
it &s;hould have been approved by the example of the author. Sir|mond
was him&s;elf fifty-five years of age when he publi&s;hed (in 1614)
his fir&s;t work, an edition of Sidonius Apollinaris, with many valu|able
annotations: (&s;ee his life, before the great edition of his works
in five volumes folio, Paris, 1696, &eacute; Typographi&acirc; Regi&acirc;).</P>
<P>Two years elap&s;ed in &s;ilence: but in the &s;pring of 1761 I yielded
to the authority of a parent, and complied, like a pious &s;on, with
the wi&s;h of my own heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, March 8th, 1758.]&mdash;I began my E&s;&s;ai &s;ur l'&Eacute;tude de la Litterature, and wrote the 23 fir&s;t chapters (excepting the following ones, 11, 12, 13. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.) before I left Switzerland.</P>
<P>July 11th. I again took in hand my E&s;&s;ay; and in about &s;ix weeks fini&s;hed it, from C. 23&mdash;55. (excepting 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. and note to C. 38.) be&s;ides a number of chapters from C. 55. to the end, which are now &s;truck out.</P>
<P>Feb. 11th, 1759. I wrote the chapters of my E&s;&s;ay, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. the note to C. 38. and the fir&s;t part of the preface.</P>
<P>April 23d, 1761. Being at length, by my father's advice, determined to publi&s;h my E&s;&s;ay, I revi&s;ed it with great care, made many alterations, &s;truck out a con&s;ider|able part, and wrote the chapters from 57&mdash;78, which I was obliged my&s;elf to copy out fair.</P>
<P>June 10th, 1761. Finding the printing of my book proceeded but &s;lowly, I went up to town, where I found the whole was fini&s;hed. I gave Becket orders for the pre&s;ents: 20 for Lau&s;anne; copies for the Duke of Richmond, Marquis of Carnarvon, Lords Waldegrave, Litchfield, Bath, Granville, Bute, Shelbourn, Che&s;terfield, Hard|wicke, Lady Hervey, Sir Jo&s;eph Yorke, Sir Matthew Feather&s;tone, M. M. Mallet, Maty, Scott, Wray, Lord Egremont, M. de Bu&s;&s;y, Mademoi&s;elle la Duche&s;&s;e d'Aguil|ion, and M. le Comte de Caylus:&mdash;great part of the&s;e were only my father's or Mallet's acquaintance.</P></NOTE>. My private re&s;olves were influenced
<PB N="89" REF="114">
by the &s;tate of Europe. About this time the belligerent powers had
made and accepted overtures of peace; our Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries
were named to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Congre&s;s of Aug&s;bourg, which never met:
I wi&s;hed to attend them as a gentleman or a &s;ecretary; and my father
fondly believed that the proof of &s;ome literary talents might introduce
me to public notice, and &s;econd the recommendations of my friends.
After a la&s;t revi&s;al I con&s;ulted with Mr. Mallet and Dr. Maty, who
approved the de&s;ign and promoted the execution. Mr. Mallet, after
hearing me read my manu&s;cript, received it from my hands, and de|livered
it into tho&s;e of Becket, with whom he made an agreement in
my name; an ea&s;y agreement: I required only a certain number of
copies; and, without transferring my property, I devolved on the
book&s;eller the charges and profits of the edition. Dr. Maty under|took,
in my ab&s;ence, to correct the &s;heets: he in&s;erted, without my
knowledge, an elegant and flattering epi&s;tle to the author; which is
compo&s;ed, however, with &s;o much art, that, in ca&s;e of a defeat, his
favourable report might have been a&s;cribed to the indulgence of a
friend for the ra&s;h attempt of a <HI>young Engli&s;h</HI> gentleman. The
work was printed and publi&s;hed, under the title of E&s;&s;ai &s;ur l'&Eacute;tude
de la Litterature, &agrave; Londres, chez T. Becket et P. A. de Hondt, 1761,
in a &s;mall volume in duodecimo: my dedication to my father, a
<PB N="90" REF="115">
proper and pious addre&s;s, was compo&s;ed the twenty-eighth of May:
Dr. Maty's letter is dated the 16th of June; and I received the fir&s;t
copy (June 23d) at Alresford, two days before I marched with the
Hamp&s;hire militia. Some weeks afterwards, on the &s;ame ground, I
pre&s;ented my book to the late Duke of York, who breakfa&s;ted in
Colonel Pitt's tent. By my father's direction, and Mallet's advice,
many literary gifts were di&s;tributed to &s;everal eminent characters in
England and France; two books were &s;ent to the Count de Caylus,
and the Duche&s;&s;e d'Aiguillon, at Paris: I had re&s;erved twenty copies
for my friends at Lau&s;anne, as the fir&s;t fruits of my education, and
a grateful token of my remembrance: and on all the&s;e per&s;ons I
levied an unavoidable tax of civility and compliment. It is not &s;ur|pri&s;ing
that a work, of which the &s;tyle and &s;entiments were &s;o totally
foreign, &s;hould have been more &s;ucce&s;sful abroad than at home. I
was delighted by the copious extracts, the warm commendations,
and the flattering predictions of the Journals of France and Holland:
and the next year (1762) a new edition (I believe at Geneva) ex|tended
the fame, or at lea&s;t the circulation, of the work. In England
it was received with cold indifference, little read, and &s;peedily for|gotten:
a &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion was &s;lowly di&s;per&s;ed; the book&s;eller mur|mured,
and the author (had his feelings been more exqui&s;ite) might
have wept over the blunders and baldne&s;s of the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation.
The publication of my Hi&s;tory fifteen years afterwards revived the
memory of my fir&s;t performance, and the E&s;&s;ay was eagerly &s;ought
in the &s;hops. But I refu&s;ed the permi&s;&s;ion which Becket &s;olicited of
reprinting it: the public curio&s;ity was imperfectly &s;atisfied by a
pirated copy of the book&s;ellers of Dublin; and when a copy of the
original edition has been di&s;covered in a &s;ale, the primitive value of
half-a-crown has ri&s;en to the fanciful price of a guinea or thirty
&s;hillings.</P>
<P>I have expatiated on the petty circum&s;tances and period of my
fir&s;t publication, a memorable aera in the life of a &s;tudent, when he
<PB N="91" REF="116">
ventures to reveal the mea&s;ure of his mind: his hopes and fears are
multiplied by the idea of &s;elf-importance, and he believes for a while
that the eyes of mankind are &s;ixed on his per&s;on and performance.
Whatever may be my pre&s;ent reputation, it no longer re&s;ts on the
merit of this fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay; and at the end of twenty-eight years I may
appreciate my juvenile work with the impartiality, and almo&s;t with
the indifference, of a &s;tranger. In his an&s;wer to Lady Hervey, the
Count de Caylus admires, or affects to admire, <Q>les livres &s;ans
nombre que Mr. Gibbon a lus et tres bien lus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> See Appendix, Letter, No. X.</NOTE></Q>. But, alas! my
&s;tock of erudition at that time was &s;canty and &s;uperficial; and if I
allow my&s;elf the liberty of naming the Greek ma&s;ters, my genuine
and per&s;onal acquaintance was con&s;ined to the Latin cla&s;&s;ics. The
mo&s;t &s;erious defect of my E&s;&s;ay is a kind of ob&s;curity and abruptne&s;s
which always fatigues, and may often elude, the attention of the
reader. In&s;tead of a preci&s;e and proper definition of the title it&s;elf,
the &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>Litterature</HI> is loo&s;ely and variou&s;ly applied: a
number of remarks and examples, hi&s;torical, critical, philo&s;ophical,
are heaped on each other without method or connection; and if we
except &s;ome introductory pages, all the remaining chapters might
indifferently be rever&s;ed or tran&s;po&s;ed. The ob&s;curity of many
pa&s;&s;ages is often affected, <HI>brevis e&s;&s;e laboro, ob&s;curus fio;</HI> the de&s;ire
of expre&s;&s;ing perhaps a common idea with &s;ententious and oracular
brevity: alas! how fatal has been the imitation of Monte&s;quieu!
But this ob&s;curity &s;ometimes proceeds from a mixture of light and
darkne&s;s in the author's mind; from a partial ray which &s;trikes upon
an angle, in&s;tead of &s;preading it&s;elf over the &s;urface of an object.
After this fair confe&s;&s;ion I &s;hall pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that the E&s;&s;ay does
credit to a young writer of two and twenty years of age, who had
read with ta&s;te, who thinks with freedom, and who writes in a fo|reign
language with &s;pirit and elegance. The defence of the early
Hi&s;tory of Rome and the new Chronology of Sir I&s;aac Newton
<PB N="92" REF="117">
form a &s;pecious argument. The patriotic and political de&s;ign of the
Georgies is happily conceived; and any probable conjecture, which
tends to rai&s;e the dignity of the poet and the poem, de&s;erves to be
adopted, without a rigid &s;crutiny. Some dawnings of a philo&s;ophic
&s;pirit enlighten the general remarks on the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory and of
man. I am not di&s;plea&s;ed with the inquiry into the origin and na|ture
of the gods of polythei&s;m, which might de&s;erve the illu&s;tra|tion
of a riper judgment. Upon the whole, I may apply to the
fir&s;t labour of my pen the &s;peech of a far &s;uperior arti&s;t, when he
&s;urveyed the fir&s;t productions of his pencil. After viewing &s;ome
portraits which he had painted in his youth, my friend Sir Jo&s;hua
Reynolds acknowledged to me, that he was rather humbled than
flattered by the compari&s;on with his pre&s;ent works; and that after
&s;o much time and &s;tudy, he had conceived his improvement to be
much greater than he found it to have been.</P>
<P>At Lau&s;anne I compo&s;ed the fir&s;t chapters of my E&s;&s;ay in French,
the familiar language of my conver&s;ation and &s;tudies, in which it
was ea&s;ier for me to write than in my mother-tongue. After my
return to England I continued the &s;ame practice, without any af|fectation,
or de&s;ign of repudiating (as Dr. Bentley would &s;ay) my
vernacular idiom. But I &s;hould have e&s;caped &s;ome Anti-gallican
clamour, had I been content with the more natural character of an
Engli&s;h author. I &s;hould have been more con&s;i&s;tent had I rejected
Mallet's advice, of prefixing an Engli&s;h dedication to a French book;
a confu&s;ion of tongues that &s;eemed to accu&s;e the ignorance of my
patron. The u&s;e of a foreign dialect might be excu&s;ed by the hope
of being employed as a negociator, by the de&s;ire of being generally
under&s;tood on the continent; but my true motive was doubtle&s;s the
ambition of new and &s;ingular fame, an Engli&s;hman claiming a place
among the writers of France. The Latin tongue had been con&s;e|crated
by the &s;ervice of the church, it was refined by the imitation of
the ancients; and in the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth centuries the &s;cholars
<PB N="93" REF="118">
of Europe enjoyed the advantage, which they have gradually re|&s;igned,
of conver&s;ing and writing in a common and learned idiom.
As that idiom was no longer in any country the vulgar &s;peech, they
all &s;tood on a level with each other; yet a citizen of old Rome
might have &s;miled at the be&s;t Latinity of the Germans and Britons;
and we may learn from the <HI>Ciceronianus</HI> of Era&s;mus, how difficult it
was found to &s;teer a middle cour&s;e between pedantry and barbari&s;m.
The Romans them&s;elves had &s;ometimes attempted a more perilous
ta&s;k, of writing in a living language, and appealing to the ta&s;te and
judgment of the natives. The vanity of Tully was doubly intere&s;ted
in the Greek memoirs of his own con&s;ul&s;hip; and if he mode&s;tly
&s;uppo&s;es that &s;ome Latini&s;ms might be detected in his &s;tyle, he is
confident of his own &s;kill in the art of I&s;ocrates and Ari&s;totle;
and he reque&s;ts his friend Atticus to di&s;per&s;e the copies of his work
at Athens, and in the other cities of Greece, (<HI>ad Atticum,</HI> i. 19. ii. 1.)
But it mu&s;t not be forgotten, that from infancy to manhood Cicero
and his contemporaries had read and declaimed, and compo&s;ed with
equal diligence in both languages; and that he was not allowed to
frequent a Latin &s;chool till he had imbibed the le&s;&s;ons of the Greek
grammarians and rhetoricians. In modern times, the language of
France has been diffu&s;ed by the merit of her writers, the &s;ocial
manners of the natives, the influence of the monarchy, and the
exile of the prote&s;tants. Several foreigners have &s;eized the oppor|tunity
of &s;peaking to Europe in this common dialect, and Germany
may plead the authority of Leibnitz and Frederic, of the fir&s;t of her
philo&s;ophers, and the greate&s;t of her kings. The ju&s;t pride and
laudable prejudice of England has re&s;trained this communication of
idioms; and of all the nations on this &s;ide of the Alps, my country|men
are the lea&s;t practi&s;ed, and lea&s;t perfect in the exerci&s;e of the
French tongue. By Sir William Temple and Lord Che&s;terfield it was
only u&s;ed on occa&s;ions of civility and bu&s;ine&s;s, and their printed letters
will not be quoted as models of compo&s;ition. Lord Bolingbroke may
<PB N="94" REF="119">
have publi&s;hed in French a &s;ketch of his Reflections on Exile: but his
reputation now repo&s;es on the addre&s;s of Voltaire, <Q>Docte &s;ermones
utriu&s;que linguae;</Q> and by his Engli&s;h dedication to Queen Caro|line,
and his E&s;&s;ay on Epic Poetry, it &s;hould &s;eem that Voltaire him&s;elf
wi&s;hed to de&s;erve a return of the &s;ame compliment. The exception
of Count Hamilton cannot fairly be urged; though an Iri&s;hman by
birth, he was educated in France from his childhood. Yet I am
&s;urpri&s;ed that a long re&s;idence in England, and the habits of do|me&s;tic
conver&s;ation, did not affect the ea&s;e and purity of his inimi|table
&s;tyle; and I regret the omi&s;&s;ion of his Engli&s;h ver&s;es, which
might have afforded an amu&s;ing object of compari&s;on. I might
therefore a&s;&s;ume the <HI>primus ego in patriam, &amp;c.;</HI> but with what &s;uc|ce&s;s
I have explored this untrodden path mu&s;t be left to the deci&s;ion
of my French readers. Dr. Maty, who might him&s;elf be que&s;tioned
as a foreigner, has &s;ecured his retreat at my expence. <Q>Je ne crois
pas que vous vous piquiez d'&ecirc;tre moins facile &agrave; reconnoitre pour un
Anglois que Lucullus pour un Romain.</Q> My friends at Paris have
been more indulgent, they received me as a countryman, or at lea&s;t
as a provincial; but they were friends and Pari&s;ians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The copious extracts which were given in the <HI>Journal Etranger</HI> by Mr. Suard, a judicious critic, mu&s;t &s;atisfy both the author and the public. I may here ob&s;erve, that I have never &s;een in any literary review a tolerable account of my Hi&s;tory. The manufacture of journals, at lea&s;t on the continent, is mi&s;erably deba&s;ed.</NOTE>. The defects
which Maty in&s;inuates, <Q>Ces traits &s;aillans, ces figures hardies, ce
&s;acrifice de la r&eacute;gle au &s;entiment, et de la cadence &agrave; la force,</Q> are
the faults of the youth, rather than of the &s;tranger: and after the
long and laborious exerci&s;e of my own language, I am con&s;cious
that my French &s;tyle has been ripened and improved.</P>
<P>I have already hinted, that the publication of my E&s;&s;ay was de|layed
till I had embraced the military profe&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall now amu&s;e
my&s;elf with the recollection of an active &s;cene, which bears no
affinity to any other period of my &s;tudious and &s;ocial life.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="120">
In the out&s;et of a glorious war, the Engli&s;h people had been de|fended
by the aid of German mercenaries. A national militia has
been the cry of every patriot &s;ince the Revolution; and this mea&s;ure,
both in parliament and in the field, was &s;upported by the country
gentlemen or Tories, who in&s;en&s;ibly transferred their loyalty to the
hou&s;e of Hanover: in the language of Mr. Burke, they have changed
the idol, but they have pre&s;erved the idolatry. In the act of offer|ing
our names and receiving our commi&s;&s;ions, as major and captain
in the Hamp&s;hire regiment, (June 12th, 1759,) we had not &s;up|po&s;ed
that we &s;hould be dragged away, my father from his farm,
my&s;elf from my books, and condemned, during two years and a half,
(May 10, 1760&mdash;December 23, 1762,) to a wandering life of military
&s;ervitude. But a weekly or monthly exerci&s;e of thirty thou&s;and pro|vincials
would have left them u&s;ele&s;s and ridiculous; and after the
pretence of an inva&s;ion had vani&s;hed, the popularity of Mr. Pitt gave
a &s;anction to the illegal &s;tep of keeping them till the end of the war
under arms, in con&s;tant pay and duty, and at a di&s;tance from their
re&s;pective homes. When the King's order for our embodying came
down, it was too late to retreat, and too &s;oon to repent. The South
battalion of the Hamp&s;hire militia was a &s;mall independent corps of
four hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix, officers and men, commanded by
lieutenant-colonel Sir Thomas Wor&s;ley, who, after a prolix and
pa&s;&s;ionate conte&s;t, delivered us from the tyranny of the lord lieute|nant,
the Duke of Bolton. My proper &s;tation, as fir&s;t captain, was
at the head of my own, and afterwards of the grenadier, company;
but in the ab&s;ence, or even in the pre&s;ence, of the two field officers,
I was entru&s;ted by my friend and my father with the effective labour
of dictatig the orders, and exerci&s;ing the battalion. With the help
of our original journal, I could write the hi&s;tory of my bloodle&s;s
and inglorious campaigns; but as the&s;e events have lo&s;t much of
their importance in my own eyes, they &s;hall be di&s;patched in a few
words. From Winche&s;ter, the fir&s;t place of a&s;&s;embly, (June 4, 1760,)
<PB N="96" REF="121">
we were removed, at our own reque&s;t, for the benefit of a foreign
education. By the arbitrary, and often capricious, orders of the
War-office, the battalion &s;ucce&s;&s;ively marched to the plea&s;ant and
ho&s;pitable Blandford (June 17); to Hil&s;ea barracks, a &s;eat of di&s;ea&s;e
and di&s;cord (September 1); to Cranbrook in the weald of Kent
(December 11); to the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Dover (December 27); to Win|che&s;ter
camp (June 25, 1761); to the populous and di&s;orderly town
of Devizes (October 23); to Sali&s;bury (February 28, 1762); to our
beloved Blandford a &s;econd time (March 9); and finally, to the
fa&s;hionable re&s;ort of Southampton (June 2); where the colours were
fixed till our final di&s;&s;olution (December 23). On the beach at
Dover we had exerci&s;ed in &s;ight of the Gallic &s;hores. But the mo&s;t
&s;plendid and u&s;eful &s;cene of our life was a four months encampment
on Winche&s;ter Down, under the command of the Earl of Effing|ham.
Our army con&s;i&s;ted of the thirty-fourth regiment of foot
and &s;ix militia corps. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our defects was &s;timu|lated
by friendly emulation. We improved our time and opportu|nities
in morning and evening field-days; and in the general re|views
the South Hamp&s;hire were rather a credit than a di&s;grace to
the line. In our &s;ub&s;equent quarters of the Devizes and Blandford,
we advanced with a quick &s;tep in our military &s;tudies; the ballot of
the en&s;uing &s;ummer renewed our vigour and youth; and had the
militia &s;ub&s;i&s;ted another year, we might have conte&s;ted the prize
with the mo&s;t perfect of our brethren.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of &s;o many bu&s;y and idle hours was not compen&s;ated by
any elegant plea&s;ure; and my temper was in&s;en&s;ibly &s;oured by the
&s;ociety of our ru&s;tic officers. In every &s;tate there exi&s;ts, however,
a balance of good and evil. The habits of a &s;edentary life were
u&s;efully broken by the duties of an active profe&s;&s;ion: in the health|ful
exerci&s;e of the field I hunted with a battalion, in&s;tead of a pack;
and at that time I was ready, at any hour of the day or night, to
fly from quarters to London, from London to quarters, on the
<PB N="97" REF="122">
&s;lighte&s;t call of private or regimental bu&s;ine&s;s. But my principal
obligation to the militia, was the making me an Engli&s;hman, and a
&s;oldier. After my foreign education, with my re&s;erved temper, I
&s;hould long have continued a &s;tranger in my native country, had I
not been &s;haken in this various &s;cene of new faces and new friends:
had not experience forced me to feel the characters of our leading
men, the &s;tate of parties, the forms of office, and the operation of
our civil and military &s;y&s;tem. In this peaceful &s;ervice, I imbibed the
rudiments of the language, and &s;cience of tactics, which opened a
new field of &s;tudy and ob&s;ervation. I diligently read, and meditated,
the <HI>Memoires Militaires</HI> of Quintus Icilius, (Mr. Guichardt,) the
only writer who has united the merits of a profe&s;&s;or and a veteran.
The di&s;cipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a
clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion; and the captain of
the Hamp&s;hire grenadiers (the reader may &s;mile) has not been u&s;e|le&s;s
to the hi&s;torian of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>A youth of any &s;pirit is fired even by the play of arms, and in
the fir&s;t &s;allies of my enthu&s;ia&s;m I had &s;eriou&s;ly attempted to em|brace
the regular profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;oldier. But this military fever
was cooled by the enjoyment of our mimic Bellona, who &s;oon un|veiled
to my eyes her naked deformity. How often did I &s;igh for my
proper &s;tation in &s;ociety and letters. How often (a proud compari&s;on)
did I repeat the complaint of Cicero in the command of a provincial
army: <Q>Clitellae bovi &s;unt impo&s;itae. E&s;t incredibile quam me
negotii taedeat. Non habet &s;atis magnum campum ille tibi non
ignotus cur&s;us animi; et indu&s;triae meae praeclara opera ce&s;&s;at.

a &s;ervice without danger I might indeed have retired without di&s;|grace;
but as often as I hinted a wi&s;h of re&s;igning, my fetters
were rivetted by the friendly intreaties of the colonel, the parental
authority of the major, and my own regard for the honour and
<PB N="98" REF="123">
welfare of the battalion. When I felt that my per&s;onal e&s;cape was
impracticable, I bowed my neck to the yoke: my &s;ervitude was
protracted far beyond the annual patience of Cicero; and it was not
till after the preliminaries of peace that I received my di&s;charge, from
the act of government which di&s;embodied the militia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, January 11th, 1761.]&mdash;In the&s;e &s;even or eight months of a mo&s;t di&s;|agreeably active life, I have had no &s;tudies to &s;et down; indeed, I hardly took a book in my hand the whole time. The fir&s;t two months at Blandford, I might have done &s;ome|thing; but the novelty of the thing, of which for &s;ome time I was &s;o fond as to think of going into the army, our field-days, our dinners abroad, and the drinking and late hours we got into, prevented any &s;erious reflections. From the day we marched from Blandford I had hardly a moment I could call my own, almo&s;t continually in motion; if I was fixed for a day, it was in the guard-room, a barrack, or an inn. Our di&s;putes con&s;umed the little time I had left. Every letter, every memorial relative to them fell to my &s;hare; and our evening conferences were u&s;ed to hear all the morning hours &s;trike. At la&s;t I got to Dover, and Sir Thomas left us for two months. The charm was over, I was &s;ick of &s;o hateful a &s;ervice; I was &s;ettled in a comparatively quiet &s;itu|ation. Once more I began to ta&s;te the plea&s;ure of thinking.</P>
<P>Recollecting &s;ome thoughts I had formerly had in relation to the &s;y&s;tem of Pagani&s;m, which I intended to make u&s;e of in my E&s;&s;ay, I re&s;olved to read Tully de Natur&acirc; Deo|rum, and fini&s;hed it in about a month. I lo&s;t &s;ome time before I could recover my habit of application.</P>
<P>Oct. 23d.]&mdash;Our fir&s;t de&s;ign was to march through Marlborough; but finding on inquiry that it was a bad road, and a great way about, we re&s;olved to pu&s;h for the Devizes in one day, though nearly thirty miles. We accordingly arrived there about three o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Nov. 2d.]&mdash;I have very little to &s;ay for this and the following month. Nothing could be more uniform than the life I led there. The little civility of the neighbouring gentlemen gave us no opportunity of dining out; the time of year did not tempt us to any excur&s;ions round the country; and at fir&s;t my indolence, and afterwards a violent cold, prevented my going over to Bath. I believe in the two months I never dined or lay from quarters. I can therefore only &s;et down what I did in the literary way. De|&s;igning to recover my Greek, which I had &s;omewhat neglected, I &s;et my&s;elf to read Homer, and fini&s;hed the four fir&s;t books of the Iliad, with Pope's tran&s;lation and notes; at the &s;ame time, to under&s;tand the geography of the Iliad, and particularly the cata|logue, I read the 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th, and 14th books of Strabo, in Ca&s;au|bon's Latin tran&s;lation: I likewi&s;e read Hume's Hi&s;tory of England to the Reign of Henry the Seventh, ju&s;t publi&s;hed, <HI>ingenious but &s;uperficial;</HI> and the <HI>Journals des S&ccedil;avans</HI> for Augu&s;t, September, and October 1761, with the <HI>Bibliotheque des Sciences,</HI> &amp;c. from July to October: Both the&s;e Journals &s;peak very hand&s;omely of my book.</P>
<P>December 25th, 1761.]&mdash;When, upon fini&s;hing the year, I take a review of what I have done, I am not di&s;&s;atisfied with what I did in it, upon making proper allowances. On the one hand, I could begin nothing before the middle of January. The Deal duty lo&s;t me part of February; although I was at home part of March, and all April, yet electioneering is no friend to the Mu&s;es. May, indeed, though di&s;&s;ipated by our &s;ea parties, was pretty quiet; but June was ab&s;olutely lo&s;t, upon the march, at Alton, and &s;ettling our&s;elves in camp. The four &s;ucceeding months in camp allowed me little lei&s;ure, and le&s;s quiet. November and December were indeed as much my own as any time can be whil&s;t I remain in the militia; but &s;till it is, at be&s;t, not a life for a man of letters. However, in this tumultuous year, (be&s;ides &s;maller things which I have &s;et down,) I read four books of Homer in Greek, &s;ix of Strabo in Latin, Cicero de Natur&acirc; Deorum, and the great philo&s;ophical and theological work of M. de Beau|&s;obre: I wrote in the &s;ame time a long di&s;&s;ertation on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Naples; re|viewed, &s;itted for the pre&s;s, and augmented above a fourth, my E&s;&s;ai &s;ur l'&Eacute;tude de la Litterature.</P>
<P>In the &s;ix weeks I pa&s;&s;ed at Beriton, as I never &s;tirred from it, every day was like the former. I had neither vi&s;its, hunting, or walking. My only re&s;ources were my|&s;elf, my books, and family conver&s;ations.&mdash;But to me the&s;e were great re&s;ources.</P>
<P>April 24th, 1762.]&mdash;I waited upon Colonel Harvey in the morning, to get him to apply for me to be brigade major to Lord E&s;&s;ingham, as a po&s;t I &s;hould be very fond of, and for which I am not unfit. Harvey received me with great good-nature and candour, told me he was both willing and able to &s;erve me; that indeed he had already applied to Lord E&s;&s;ingham for * * * * *, one of his own officers, and though there would be more than one brigade major, he did not think he could pro|perly recommend two; but that if I could get &s;ome other per&s;on to break the ice, he would &s;econd it, and believed he &s;hould &s;ucceed: &s;hould that fail, as * * * * * was in bad circum&s;tances, he believed he could make a compromi&s;e with him (this was my de&s;ire) to let me do the duty without pay. I went from him to the Mallets, who pro|mi&s;ed to get Sir Charles Howard to &s;peak to Lord E&s;&s;ingham.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 22d.]&mdash;I went with Ballard to the French church, where I heard a mo&s;t indifferent &s;ermon preached by M. * * * * * *. A very bad &s;tyle, a wor&s;e pronun|ciation and action, and a very great vacuity of ideas, compo&s;ed this excellent per|formance. Upon the whole, which is preferable, the philo&s;ophic method of the Engli&s;h, or the rhetoric of the French preachers? The fir&s;t (though le&s;s glorious) is certainly &s;afer for the preacher. It is difficult for a man to make him&s;elf ridiculous, who propo&s;es only to deliver plain &s;en&s;e on a &s;ubject he has thoroughly &s;tudied. But the in&s;tant he di&s;covers the lea&s;t preten&s;ions towards the &s;ublime, or the pathetic, there is no medium; we mu&s;t either admire or laugh: and there are &s;o many various talents requi&s;ite to form the character of an orator, that it is more than probable we &s;hall laugh. As to the advantage of the hearer, which ought to be the great con&s;ideration, the dilemma is much greater. Excepting in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, where we are blinded by popular prejudices, we are in general &s;o well acquainted with our duty, that it is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to convince us of it. It is the heart, and not the head, that holds out; and it is certainly po&s;&s;ible, by a moving eloquence, to rou&s;e the &s;leeping &s;entiments of that heart, and incite it to acts of virtue. Unluckily it is not &s;o much acts, as habits of virtue, we &s;hould have in view; and the preacher who is inculcating, with the eloquence of a Bourdaloue, the nece&s;&s;ity of a virtuous life, will di&s;mi&s;s his a&s;&s;embly full of emotions, which a variety of other objects, the coldne&s;s of our northern con|&s;titutions, and no immediate opportunity of exerting their good re&s;olutions, will di&s;&s;i|pate in a few moments.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 24th.]&mdash;The &s;ame rea&s;on that carried &s;o many people to the a&s;&s;embly to-night, was what kept me away; I mean the dancing.</P>
<P>28th.]&mdash;To-day Sir Thomas came to us to dinner. The Spa has done him a great deal of good, for he looks another man. Plea&s;ed to &s;ee him, we kept bumperizing till after roll-calling; Sir Thomas a&s;&s;uring us, every fre&s;h bottle, how infinitely &s;oberer he was grown.</P>
<P>29th.]&mdash;I felt the u&s;ual con&s;equences of Sir Thomas's company, and lo&s;t a morn|ing, becau&s;e I had lo&s;t the day before. However, having fini&s;hed Voltaire, I re|turned to Le Clerc (I mean for the amu&s;ement of my lei&s;ure hours); and laid a&s;ide for &s;ome time his <HI>Bibliotheque Univer&s;elle,</HI> to look into the <HI>Bibliotheque Choi&s;ie,</HI> which is by far the better work.</P>
<P>September 23d.]&mdash;Colonel Wilkes, of the Buckingham&s;hire militia, dined with us, and renewed the acquaintance Sir Thomas and my&s;elf had begun with him at Reading. I &s;carcely ever met with a better companion; he has inexhau&s;tible &s;pirits, infinite wit and humour, and a great deal of knowledge. He told us him&s;elf, that in this time of public di&s;&s;en&s;ion he was re&s;olved to make his fortune. Upon this principle he has con|nected him&s;elf clo&s;ely with Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt, commenced a public adver&s;ary to Lord Bute, whom he abu&s;es weekly in the North Briton, and other political papers in which he is concerned. This proved a very debauched day: we drank a good deal both after dinner and &s;upper; and when at la&s;t Wilkes had retired, Sir Thomas and &s;ome others (of whom I was not one) broke into his room, and made him drink a bottle of claret in bed.</P>
<P>October 5th.]&mdash;The review, which la&s;ted about three hours, concluded, as u&s;ual, with marching by Lord E&s;&s;ingham, by grand divi&s;ions. Upon the whole, con|&s;idering the camp had done both the Winche&s;ter and the Go&s;port duties all the &s;ummer, they behaved very well, and made a &s;ine appearance. As they marched by, I had my u&s;ual curio&s;ity to count their files. The following is my field return: I think it a curio&s;ity; I am &s;ure it is more exact than is commonly made to a reviewing general.</P>

<P>N. B. The Go&s;port detachment from the Lanca&s;hire con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred and fifty men. The Buckingham&s;hire took the Winche&s;ter duty that day.</P>
<P>So that this camp in England, &s;uppo&s;ed complete, with only one detachment, had under arms, on the day of the grand review, little more than half their e&s;tabli&s;hment. This amazing deficiency (though exemplified in every regiment I have &s;een) is an extraordinary military phoenomenon: what mu&s;t it be upon foreign &s;ervice? I doubt whether a nominal army of an hundred thou&s;and men often brings fifty into the field.</P>
<P>Upon our return to Southampton in the evening, we found Sir Thomas Wor&s;ley.</P>
<P>October 21&s;t.]&mdash;One of tho&s;e impul&s;es, which it is neither very ea&s;y nor very nece&s;&s;ary to with&s;tand, drew me from Longinus to a very different &s;ubject, the Greek Calendar. La&s;t night, when in bed, I was thinking of a di&s;&s;ertation of M. de la Nauze upon the Roman calendar, which I read la&s;t year. This led me to con&s;ider what was the Greek, and finding my&s;elf very ignorant of it, I determined to read a &s;hort, but very excellent ab&s;tract of Mr. Dodwell's book de Cyclis, by the famous Dr. Halley. It is only twenty-five pages; but as I meditated it thoroughly, and verified all the calculations, it was a very good morning's work.</P>
<P>October 28th.]&mdash;I looked over a new Greek Lexicon which I have ju&s;t received from London. It is that of Robert Con&s;tantine, Lugdun. 1637. It is a very large volume in folio, in two parts, compri&s;ing in the whole 1785 pages. After the great The&s;aurus, this is e&s;teemed the be&s;t Greek Lexicon. It &s;eems to be &s;o. Of a variety of words for which I looked, I always found an exact definition; the various &s;en&s;es well di&s;tingui&s;hed, and properly &s;upported, by the be&s;t authorities. However, I &s;till prefer the radical method of Scapula to this alphabetical one.</P>
<P>December 11th.]&mdash;I have already given an idea of the Go&s;port duty; I &s;hall only add a trait which characterizes admirably our unthinking &s;ailors. At a time when they knew that they &s;hould infallibly be di&s;charged in a few weeks, numbers, who had con|&s;iderable wages due to them, were continually jumping over the walls, and ri&s;quing the lo&s;ing of it for a few hours amu&s;ement at Port&s;mouth.</P>
<P>17th.]&mdash;We found old Captain Meard at Alresford, with the &s;econd divi&s;ion of the fourteenth. He and all his officers &s;upped with us, and made the evening rather a drunken one.</P>
<P>18th.]&mdash;About the &s;ame hour our two corps paraded to march off. They, an old corps of regulars, who had been two years quiet in Dover ca&s;tle. We, part of a young body of militia, two-thirds of our men recruits, of four months &s;tanding, two of which they had pa&s;&s;ed upon very di&s;agreeable duty. Every advantage was on their &s;ide, and yet our &s;uperiority, both as to appearance and di&s;cipline, was &s;o &s;triking, that the mo&s;t prejudiced regular could not have he&s;itated a moment. At the end of the town our two companies &s;eparated; my father's &s;truck off for Petersfield, whil&s;t I continued my rout to Alton; into which place I marched my company about noon; two years &s;ix months and fifteen days after my fir&s;t leaving it. I gave the men &s;ome beer at roll-calling, which they received with great cheerfulne&s;s and decency. I dined and lay at Harri&s;on's, where I was received with that old-fa&s;hioned breeding, which is at once &s;o honourable and &s;o trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>23d.]&mdash;Our two companies were di&s;embodied; mine at Alton, and my father's at Beriton. Smith marched them over from Petersfield: they fired three vollies, lodged the major's colours, delivered up their arms, received their money, partook of a dinner at the major's expence, and then &s;eparated with great cheerfulne&s;s and regularity. Thus ended the militia; I may &s;ay ended, &s;ince our annual a&s;&s;emblies in May are &s;o very precarious, and can be of &s;o little u&s;e. However, our &s;erjeants and drums are &s;till kept up, and quartered at the rendezvous of their company, and the adjutant remains at Southampton in full pay.</P>
<P>As this was an extraordinary &s;cene of life, in which I was engaged above three years and a half from the date of my commi&s;&s;ion, and above two years and a half from the time of our embodying, I cannot take my leave of it without &s;ome few reflec|tions. When I engaged in it, I was totally ignorant of its nature and con&s;equences. I offered, becau&s;e my father did, without ever imagining that we &s;hould be called out, till it was too late to retreat with honour. Indeed, I believe it happens through|out, that our mo&s;t important actions have been often determined by chance, caprice, or &s;ome very inadequate motive. After our embodying, many things contributed to make me &s;upport it with great impatience. Our continual di&s;putes with the duke of Bolton; our un&s;ettled way of life, which hardly allowed me books or lei&s;ure for &s;tudy; and more than all, the di&s;agreeable &s;ociety in which I was forced to live.</P>
<P>After mentioning my &s;ufferings, I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething of what I found agreeable. Now it is over, I can make the &s;eparation much better than I could at the time. 1. The un&s;ettled way of life it&s;elf had its advantages. The exerci&s;e and change of air and of objects amu&s;ed me, at the &s;ame time that it fortified my health. 2. A new field of knowledge and amu&s;ement opened it&s;elf to me; that of military affairs, which, both in my &s;tudies and travels, will give me eyes for a new world of things, which before would have pa&s;&s;ed unheeded. Indeed, in that re&s;pect I can hardly help wi&s;hing our battalion had continued another year. We had got a fine &s;et of new men, all our difficulties were over; we were perfectly well clothed and appointed; and, from the progre&s;s our recruits had already made, we could promi&s;e our&s;elves that we &s;hould be one of the be&s;t militia corps by next &s;ummer: a circum&s;tance that would have been the more agreeable to me, as I am now e&s;tabli&s;hed the real acting major of the battalion. But what I value mo&s;t, is the knowledge it has given me of mankind in general, and of my own country in particular. The general &s;y&s;tem of our government, the methods of our &s;everal offices, the departments and powers of their re&s;pective officers, our pro|vincial and municipal admini&s;tration, the views of our &s;everal parties, the characters, connections, and influence of our principal people, have been impre&s;&s;ed on my mind, not by vain theory, but by the indelible le&s;&s;ons of action and experience. I have made a number of valuable acquaintance, and am my&s;elf much better known, than (with my re&s;erved character) I &s;hould have been in ten years, pa&s;&s;ing regularly my &s;ummers at Beriton, and my winters in London. So that the &s;um of all is, that I am glad the militia has been, and glad that it is no more.</P></NOTE>.</P>

con&s;umed the hours which were not employed in the field; and
amid the perpetual hurry of an inn, a barrack, or a guard-room, all

literary ideas were bani&s;hed from my mind. After this long fa&s;t,
the longe&s;t which I have ever known, I once more ta&s;ted at Dover

the plea&s;ures of reading and thinking; and the hungry appetite with
which I opened a volume of Tully's philo&s;ophical works is &s;till
pre&s;ent to my memory. The la&s;t review of my E&s;&s;ay before its pub|lication,
had prompted me to inve&s;tigate the <HI>nature of the gods;</HI> my
inquiries led me to the Hi&s;toire Critique du Manich&egrave;i&s;me of Beau|&s;obre,

who di&s;cu&s;&s;es many deep que&s;tions of Pagan and Chri&s;tian
theology: and from this rich trea&s;ury of facts and opinions, I de|duced
my own con&s;equences, beyond the holy circle of the author.
After this recovery I never relap&s;ed into indolence; and my ex|ample
might prove, that in the life mo&s;t aver&s;e to &s;tudy, &s;ome hours
may be &s;tolen, &s;ome minutes may be &s;natched. Amid&s;t the tumult
of Winche&s;ter camp I &s;ometimes thought and read in my tent; in
the more &s;ettled quarters of the Devizes, Blandford, and South|ampton,
I always &s;ecured a &s;eparate lodging, and the nece&s;&s;ary books;
and in the &s;ummer of 1762, while the new militia was rai&s;ing, I
enjoyed at Beriton two or three months of literary repo&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOURNAL, May 8th, 1762.]&mdash;This was my birth-day, on which I entered into the twenty-&s;ixth year of my age. This gave me occa&s;ion to look a little into my&s;elf, and con&s;ider impartially my good and bad qualities. It appeared to me, upon this inquiry, that my character was virtuous, incapable of a ba&s;e action, and formed for generous ones; but that it was proud, violent, and di&s;agreeable in &s;ociety. The&s;e qualities I mu&s;t endeavour to cultivate, extirpate, or re&s;train, according to their dif|ferent tendency. Wit I have none. My imagination is rather &s;trong than plea&s;ing. My memory both capacious and retentive. The &s;hining qualities of my under&s;tanding are exten&s;ivene&s;s and penetration; but I want both quickne&s;s and exactne&s;s. As to my &s;ituation in life, though I may &s;ometimes repine at it, it perhaps is the be&s;t adapted to my character. I can command all the conveniencies of life, and I can command too that independence, (that fir&s;t earthly ble&s;&s;ing,) which is hardly to be met with in a higher or lower fortune. When I talk of my &s;ituation, I mu&s;t exclude that temporary one, of being in the militia. Though I go through it with &s;pirit and ap|plication, it is both unfit for, and unworthy of me.</NOTE>. In
forming a new plan of &s;tudy, I he&s;itated between the mathematics
and the Greek language; both of which I had neglected &s;ince my
return from Lau&s;anne. I con&s;ulted a learned and friendly mathe|matician,
Mr. George Scott, a pupil of de Moivre; and his map
of a country which I have never explored, may perhaps be more
&s;erviceable to others<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letter, N^o XI. <HI>excellent,</HI> from Mr. Scott to Mr. Gibbon.</NOTE>. As &s;oon as I had given the preference to
Greek, the example of Scaliger and my own rea&s;on determined me

<P>In the &s;tudy of a poet who has &s;ince become the mo&s;t intimate of
my friends, I &s;ucce&s;&s;ively applied many pa&s;&s;ages and fragments of
Greek writers; and among the&s;e I &s;hall notice a life of Homer, in
the Opu&s;cula Mythologica of Gale, &s;everal books of the geography

grammatical &s;kill was improved, my vocabulary was enlarged; and
in the militia I acquired a ju&s;t and indelible knowledge of the fir&s;t of
languages. On every march, in every journey, Horace was always in
my pocket, and often in my hand: but I &s;hould not mention his two
critical epi&s;tles, the amu&s;ement of a morning, had they not been accom|panied
by the elaborate commentary of Dr. Hurd, now Bi&s;hop of Wor|ce&s;ter.
On the intere&s;ting &s;ubjects of compo&s;ition and imitation of epic

<P>After having long revolved &s;ubjects for my intended hi&s;torical
e&s;&s;ay, I renounced my fir&s;t thought of the expedition of Charles
VIII. as too remote from us, and rather an introduction to great
events, than great and important in it&s;elf. I &s;ucce&s;&s;ively cho&s;e
and rejected the cru&s;ade of Richard the Fir&s;t, the barons' wars
again&s;t John and Henry the Third, the hi&s;tory of Edward the
Black Prince, the lives and compari&s;ons of Henry V. and the Em|peror
Titus, the life of Sir Philip Sidney, and that of the Marquis
of Montro&s;e. At length I have fixed on Sir Walter Raleigh for
<PB N="107" REF="132">
my hero. His eventful &s;tory is varied by the characters of the
&s;oldier and &s;ailor, the courtier and hi&s;torian; and it may afford
&s;uch a fund of materials as I de&s;ire, which have not yet been pro|perly
manufactured. At pre&s;ent I cannot attempt the execution
of this work. Free lei&s;ure, and the opportunity of con&s;ulting
many books, both printed and manu&s;cript, are as nece&s;&s;ary as
they are impo&s;&s;ible to be attained in my pre&s;ent way of life.
However, to acquire a general in&s;ight into my &s;ubject and re|&s;ources,
I read the life of Sir Walter Raleigh by Dr. Birch, his
copious article in the General Dictionary by the &s;ame hand, and
the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and James the Fir&s;t in Hume's

Sir Walter Raleigh, and looked more clo&s;ely into my materials.
I read the two volumes in quarto of the Bacon Papers, publi&s;hed

Mallet's Life of Lord Bacon, and the political treati&s;es of that
great man in the fir&s;t volume of his works, with many of his
letters in the &s;econd; Sir William Mon&s;on's Naval Tracts, and the

<P>(During my &s;ummer re&s;idence.)</P>
<P>I am afraid of being reduced to drop my hero; but my time
has not, however, been lo&s;t in the re&s;earch of his &s;tory, and of a
memorable aera of our Engli&s;h annals. The Life of Sir Walter
Raleigh, by Oldys, is a very poor performance; a &s;ervile pane|gyric,
or flat apology, tediou&s;ly minute, and compo&s;ed in a dull
<PB N="108" REF="133">
and affected &s;tyle. Yet the author was a man of diligence and
learning, who had read every thing relative to his &s;ubject, and
who&s;e ample collections are arranged with per&s;picuity and method.
Excepting &s;ome anecdotes lately revealed in the Sidney and Bacon
Papers, I know not what I &s;hould be able to add. My ambition
(exclu&s;ive of the uncertain merit of &s;tyle and &s;entiment) mu&s;t be
confined to the hope of giving a good abridgment of Oldys. I
I have even the di&s;appointment of finding &s;ome parts of this
copious work very dry and barren; and the&s;e parts are unluckily
&s;ome of the mo&s;t characteri&s;tic: Raleigh's colony of Virginia, his
quarrels with E&s;&s;ex, the true &s;ecret of his con&s;piracy, and, above
all, the detail of his private life, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and important
to a biographer. My be&s;t re&s;ource would be in the circumjacent
hi&s;tory of the times, and perhaps in &s;ome digre&s;&s;ions artfully in|troduced,
like the fortunes of the Peripatetic philo&s;ophy in the
portrait of Lord Bacon. But the reigns of Elizabeth and James
the Fir&s;t are the periods of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, which have been the
mo&s;t variou&s;ly illu&s;trated: and what new lights could I reflect on
a &s;ubject, which has exerci&s;ed the accurate indu&s;try of <HI>Birch,</HI> the
lively and curious acutene&s;s of <HI>Walpole,</HI> the critical &s;pirit of <HI>Hurd,</HI>
the vigorous &s;en&s;e of <HI>Mallet</HI> and <HI>Robert&s;on,</HI> and the impartial
philo&s;ophy of <HI>Hume?</HI> Could I even &s;urmount the&s;e ob&s;tacles,
I &s;hould &s;hrink with terror from the modern hi&s;tory of England,
where every character is a problem, and every reader a friend
or an enemy; where a writer is &s;uppo&s;ed to hoi&s;t a flag of party,
and is devoted to damnation by the adver&s;e faction. Such would
be <HI>my</HI> reception at home: and abroad, the hi&s;torian of Raleigh
mu&s;t encounter an indifference far more bitter than cen&s;ure or
reproach. The events of his life are intere&s;ting; but his cha|racter
is ambiguous, his actions are ob&s;cure, his writings are
Engli&s;h, and his fame is confined to the narrow limits of our
language and our i&s;land. I mu&s;t embrace a &s;afer and more ex|ten&s;ive
theme.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="134">
There is one which I &s;hould prefer to all others, <HI>The Hi&s;tory
of the Liberty of the Swi&s;s,</HI> of that independence which a brave
people re&s;cued from the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, defended again&s;t a
Dauphin of France, and finally &s;ealed with the blood of Charles
of Burgundy. From &s;uch a theme, &s;o full of public &s;pirit, of
military glory, of examples of virtue, of le&s;&s;ons of government,
the dulle&s;t &s;tranger would catch fire: what might not <HI>I</HI> hope,
who&s;e talents, what&s;oever they may be, would be inflamed with
the zeal of patrioti&s;m. But the materials of this hi&s;tory are in|acce&s;&s;ible
to me, fa&s;t locked in the ob&s;curity of an old barbarous
German dialect, of which I am totally ignorant, and which I
cannot re&s;olve to learn for this &s;ole and peculiar purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have another &s;ubject in view, which is the contra&s;t of the
former hi&s;tory: the one a poor, warlike, virtuous republic, which
emerges into glory and freedom; the other a commonwealth, &s;oft,
opulent, and corrupt; which, by ju&s;t degrees, is precipitated from
the abu&s;e to the lo&s;s of her liberty: both le&s;&s;ons are, perhaps,
equally in&s;tructive. This &s;econd &s;ubject is, <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the
Republic of Florence, under the Hou&s;e of Medicis:</HI> a period of one
hundred and fifty years, which ri&s;es or de&s;cends from the dregs of
the Florentine democracy, to the title and dominion of Co&s;mo de
Medicis in the Grand Duchy of Tu&s;cany. I might deduce a
chain of revolutions not unworthy of the pen of Vertot; &s;ingular
men, and &s;ingular events; the Medicis four times expelled, and
as often recalled; and the Genius of Freedom reluctantly yielding
to the arms of Charles V. and the policy of Co&s;mo. The cha|racter
and fate of Savanerola, and the revival of arts and letters in
Italy, will be e&s;&s;entially connected with the elevation of the family
and the fall of the republic. The Medicis (&s;tirps qua&s;i fataliter
nata ad in&s;tauranda vel fovenda &s;tudia (Lip&s;ius ad Germanos et
Gallos, Epi&s;t. viii.) were illu&s;trated by the patronage of learning;
and enthu&s;ia&s;m was the mo&s;t formidable weapon of their adver|&s;aries.
<PB N="110" REF="135">
On this &s;plendid &s;ubject I &s;hall mo&s;t probably &s;ix; but

That re&s;pectable body, of which I have the honour of being a member, affords every evening a &s;ight truly Engli&s;h. Twenty or thirty, perhaps, of the fir&s;t men in the kingdom, in point of fa&s;hion and for|tune, &s;upping at little tables covered with a napkin, in the middle of a coffee-room, upon a bit of cold meat, or a Sandwich, and drinking a gla&s;s of punch. At pre&s;ent, we are full of king's coun&s;ellors and lords of the bedchamber; who, having jumped into the mini&s;try, make a very &s;ingular medley of their old principles and language, with their modern ones.</P>
<P>Nov. 26.]&mdash;I went with Mallet to breakfa&s;t with Garrick; and thence to Drury|lane Hou&s;e, where I a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a very private rehear&s;al, in the Green-room, of a new tragedy of Mallet's, called Elvira. As I have &s;ince &s;een it acted, I &s;hall defer my opinion of it till then; but I cannot help mentioning here the &s;urpri&s;ing ver&s;atility of Mrs. Pritchard's talents, who rehear&s;ed, almo&s;t at the &s;ame time, the part of a furious queen in the Green-room, and that of a coquette on the &s;tage; and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal times from one to the other with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Dec. 30.]&mdash;Before I clo&s;e the year I mu&s;t balance my accounts&mdash;not of money, but of time. I may divide my &s;tudies into four branches: 1. Books that I have read for them&s;elves, cla&s;&s;ic writers, or capital treati&s;es upon any &s;cience; &s;uch books as ought to be peru&s;ed with attention, and meditated with care. Of the&s;e I read <HI>the twenty la&s;t books of the Iliad twice, the three fir&s;t books of the Ody&s;&s;ey, the Life of Homer,</HI> and <HI>Longinus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. 2. Books which I have read, or con&s;ulted, to illu&s;trate the former. Such as this year, <HI>Blackwall's Inquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer, Burke's Sublime and Beautiful, Hurd's Horace, Guichard's Memoires Militaires,</HI> a great va|riety of pa&s;&s;ages of the ancients occa&s;ionally u&s;eful: large extracts from <HI>Mezeriac, Bayle,</HI> and <HI>Poter;</HI> and many memoirs and ab&s;tracts from the <HI>Academy of Belles Lettres:</HI> among the&s;e I &s;hall only mention here two long and curious &s;uites of di&s;&s;ertations&mdash;<HI>the one upon the Temple of Delphi, the Amphictyonic Council, and the Holy Wars, by M. M. Har|dion and de Valois; the other upon the Games of the Grecians, by M. M. Burette, Gedoyne, and de la Barre.</HI> 3. Books of amu&s;ement and in&s;truction, peru&s;ed at my lei&s;ure hours, without any reference to a regular plan of &s;tudy. Of the&s;e, perhaps, I read too many, &s;ince I went through the Life of Era&s;mus, by Le Clerc and Burigny, many extracts from <HI>Le Clerc's Bibliotheques, The Ciceronianus,</HI> and <HI>Colloquies of Era&s;mus, Barclay's Ar|genis, Tera&s;&s;on's Sethos, Voltaire's Siecle de Louis XIV. Madame de Motteville's Memoirs,</HI> and <HI>Fontenelle's Works.</HI> 4. Compo&s;itions of my own. I find hardly any, except <HI>this Journal,</HI> and the <HI>Extract of Hurd's Horace,</HI> which (like a chapter of Montaigne) con|tains many things very different from its title. To the&s;e four heads I mu&s;t this year add a fifth. 5.

<P>The three weeks which I pa&s;&s;ed at Beriton, at the end of this and the beginning of the en&s;uing year, are almo&s;t a blank. I &s;eldom went out; and as the &s;cheme of my travelling was at la&s;t entirely &s;ettled, the hurry of impatience, the cares of preparations, and the tenderne&s;s of friends I was going to quit, allowed me hardly any moments for &s;tudy.</P></NOTE>.</Q>

The youthful habits of the language and manners of France had
left in my mind an ardent de&s;ire of revi&s;iting the Continent on a
larger and more liberal plan. According to the law of cu&s;tom, and
perhaps of rea&s;on, foreign travel completes the education of an
Engli&s;h gentleman: my father had con&s;ented to my wi&s;h, but I was
detained above four years by my ra&s;h engagement in the militia. I
eagerly gra&s;ped the fir&s;t moments of freedom: three or four weeks in
Hamp&s;hire and London were employed in the preparations of my
journey, and the farewell vi&s;its of friend&s;hip and civility: my la&s;t
act in town was to applaud Mallet's new tragedy of Elvira<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, January 11th, 1763.]&mdash;I called upon Dr. Maty in the morning. He told me that the Duke de Nivernois de&s;ired to be acquainted with me. It was in|deed with that view that I had written to Maty from Beriton to pre&s;ent, in my name, a copy of my book to him. Thence I went to Becket, paid him his bill, (fifty-four pounds,) and gave him back his tran&s;lation. It mu&s;t be printed, though very indif|ferent.

He offered me very politely letters for Paris. We dined at our lodgings. I went to Covent Garden to &s;ee Woodward in Bobadil, and &s;upped with the Mallets at George Scott's.</P>
<P>JOURNAL, Jan. 19th, 1763.]&mdash;I waited upon Lady Hervey and the Duke de Niver|nois, and received my credentials. Lady Hervey's are for M. le Comte de Caylus, and Madame Geoffrin. The Duke received me civilly, but (perhaps through Maty's fault) treated me more as a man of letters than as a man of fa&s;hion. His letters are entirely in that &s;tyle; for the Count de Caylus and M. M. de la Bleterie, de S^t^e Palaye, Ca|peronier, du Clos, de Forcemagne, and d'Alembert. I then undre&s;&s;ed for the play. My father and I went to the Ro&s;e, in the pa&s;&s;age of the play-hou&s;e, where we found Mallet, with about thirty friends. We dined together, and went thence into the pit, where we took our places in a body, ready to &s;ilence all oppo&s;ition. How|ever, we had no occa&s;ion to exert our&s;elves. Notwith&s;tanding the malice of party, Mallet's nation, connections, and, indeed, imprudence, we heard nothing but ap|plau&s;e. I think it was de&s;erved. The plan was borrowed from de la Motte, but the details and language have great merit. A &s;ine vein of dramatic poetry runs through the piece. The &s;cenes between the father and &s;on awaken almo&s;t every &s;en&s;ation of the human brea&s;t; and the coun&s;el would have equally moved, but for the inconve|nience unavoidable upon all theatres, that of entru&s;ting fine &s;peeches to indifferent actors. The perplexity of the cata&s;trophe is much, and I believe ju&s;tly, critici&s;ed. But another defect made a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion upon me. When a poet ventures upon the dreadful &s;ituation of a father who condemns his &s;on to death, there is no medium, the father mu&s;t either be a mon&s;ter or a hero. His obligations of ju&s;tice, of the public good, mu&s;t be as binding, as apparent, as perhaps tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Brutus. The cruel nece&s;&s;ity con&s;ecrates his actions, and leaves no room for re|pentance. The thought is &s;hocking, if not carried into action. In the execution of Brutus's &s;ons I am &s;en&s;ible of that fatal nece&s;&s;ity. Without &s;uch an example, the un&s;ettled liberty of Rome would have peri&s;hed the in&s;tant after its birth. But Alonzo might have pardoned his &s;on for a ra&s;h attempt, the cau&s;e of which was a private in|jury, and who&s;e con&s;equences could never have di&s;turbed an e&s;tabli&s;hed government. He might have pardoned &s;uch a crime in any other &s;ubject; and as the laws could exact only an equal rigour for a &s;on, a vain appetite for glory, and a mad a&s;&s;ectation of he|roi&s;m, could alone have influenced him to exert an unequal and &s;uperior &s;everity.</P></NOTE>; a po&s;t|chai&s;e

my diligence, that I reached Paris on the 28th of January 1763,

In this fir&s;t vi&s;it I pa&s;&s;ed three months and a half, (January 28
&mdash;May 9,) and a much longer &s;pace might have been agreeably
filled, without any intercour&s;e with the natives. At home we are
content to move in the daily round of plea&s;ure and bu&s;ine&s;s; and a
&s;cene which is always pre&s;ent is &s;uppo&s;ed to be within our know|ledge,
or at lea&s;t within our power. But in a foreign country, cu|rio&s;ity
is our bu&s;ine&s;s and our plea&s;ure; and the traveller, con&s;cious
of his ignorance, and covetous of his time, is diligent in the &s;earch
and the view of every object that can de&s;erve his attention. I de|voted
many hours of the morning to the circuit of Paris and the
neighbourhood, to the vi&s;it of churches and palaces con&s;picuous by
their architecture, to the royal manufactures, collections of books
and pictures, and all the various trea&s;ures of art, of learning, and of
luxury. An Engli&s;hman may hear without reluctance, that in the&s;e
curious and co&s;tly articles Paris is &s;uperior to London; &s;ince the opu|lence
of the French capital ari&s;es from the defects of its government
and religion. In the ab&s;ence of Louis XIV. and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the
Louvre has been left unfini&s;hed: but the millions which have been
lavi&s;hed on the &s;ands of Ver&s;ailles, and the mora&s;s of Marli, could
not be &s;upplied by the legal allowance of a Briti&s;h king. The &s;plen|dour
of the French nobles is confined to their town re&s;idence; that
of the Engli&s;h is more u&s;efully di&s;tributed in their country feats;
and we &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed at our own riches, if the labours of
architecture, the &s;poils of Italy and Greece, which are now &s;cattered
from Inverary to Wilton, were accumulated in a few &s;treets between
Marybone and We&s;tmin&s;ter. All &s;uperfluous ornament is rejected
by the cold frugality of the prote&s;tants; but the catholic &s;uper&s;ti|tion,
which is always the enemy of rea&s;on, is often the parent of
the arts. The wealthy communities of prie&s;ts and monks expend
their revenues in &s;tately edifices; and the pari&s;h church of St. Sul|pice,

Nous &s;ommes all&eacute;s d'abord &agrave; la bibliotheque de l'Abbay&eacute; de St. Germain des Prez, o&ugrave; tout le monde &eacute;toit occup&eacute; &agrave; l'arrangement d'un cabinet de curio&s;it&eacute;s, et &agrave; l'h&ograve;pital des in|valides, o&ugrave; le d&ograve;me &eacute;toit ferm&eacute; &agrave; cau&s;e des reparations qu'on y fai&s;oit. Il faut donc differer la vi&s;ite et la de&s;cription de ces deux endroits. De l&agrave; nous &s;ommes all&eacute;s voir l'&eacute;cole militaire. Comme ce b&acirc;timent s'&eacute;leve &agrave; cot&eacute; des Invalides, bien des gens y verroient un moyen a&s;&s;ez facile d'apprecier les ames differentes de leurs fondateurs. Dans l'un tout e&s;t grand et fa&s;tueux, dans l'autre tout e&s;t petit et me&s;quin. De petits corps de logis blancs et a&s;&s;ez propres, qui, au lieu de 500 gentil&s;hommes, dont on a parl&eacute;, en con|tiennent 258, compo&s;ent tout l'etabli&s;&s;ement; car le man&eacute;ge et les ecuries ne &s;ont rien. Il e&s;t vrai qu'on dit que ces batimens ne &s;ont qu'un &eacute;chaffaudage, qu'on doit &ocirc;ter, pour &eacute;lever le v&eacute;ritable ouvrage &s;ur ces d&eacute;bris. Il faut bien en effet qu'on n'ait pas b&acirc;ti pour l'&eacute;ternit&eacute;, pui&s;que dans vingt ans la pl&ucirc;part des poutres &s;e font pourries. Nous jett&acirc;mes en&s;uite un coup d'oeil &s;ur l'&eacute;gli&s;e de St. Sulpice, dont la fa&ccedil;ade (le pr&eacute;texte et le fruit de tant de lotteries) n'e&s;t point encore achev&eacute;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the principal end of my journey was to enjoy the &s;ociety
of a poli&s;hed and amiable people, in who&s;e favour I was &s;trongly
prejudiced, and to conver&s;e with &s;ome authors, who&s;e conver&s;ation,
as I fondly imagined, mu&s;t be far more plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive than
their writings. The moment was happily cho&s;en. At the clo&s;e of
a &s;ucce&s;sful war the Briti&s;h name was re&s;pected on the continent.</P>
<Q><L>Clarum et venerabile nomen</L>
<L>Gentibus.</L></Q>
<P>Our opinions, our fa&s;hions, even our games, were adopted in
France, a ray of national glory illuminated each individual, and
every Engli&s;hman was &s;uppo&s;ed to be born a patriot and a philo&s;o|pher.
For my&s;elf, I carried a per&s;onal recommendation; my name and
my E&s;&s;ay were already known; the compliment of having written in
<PB N="115" REF="140">
the French language entitled me to &s;ome returns of civility and
gratitude. I was con&s;idered as a man of letters, who wrote
for amu&s;ement. Before my departure I had obtained from the
Duke de Nivernois, Lady Hervey, the Mallets, Mr. Walpole, &amp;c.
many letters of recommendation to their private or literary friends.
Of the&s;e epi&s;tles the reception and &s;ucce&s;s were determined by
the character and &s;ituation of the per&s;ons by whom and to whom
they were addre&s;&s;ed: the &s;eed was &s;ometimes ca&s;t on a barren
rock, and it &s;ometimes multiplied an hundred fold in the pro|duction
of new &s;hoots, &s;preading branches, and exqui&s;ite fruit.
But upon the whole, I had rea&s;on to prai&s;e the national urbanity,
which from the court has diffu&s;ed its gentle influence to the &s;hop,
the cottage, and the &s;chools. Of the men of genius of the age,
Monte&s;quieu and Fontenelle were no more; Voltaire re&s;ided on his
own e&s;tate near Geneva; Rou&s;&s;eau in the preceding year had been
driven from his hermitage of Montmorency; and I blu&s;h at my
having neglected to &s;eek, in this journey, the acquaintance of Buffon.
Among the men of letters whom I &s;aw, D'Alembert and Diderot
held the foremo&s;t rank in merit, or at lea&s;t in fame. I &s;hall content
my&s;elf with enumerating the well-known names of the Count de
Caylus, of the Abb&eacute; de la Bleterie, Barthelemy, Reynal, Arnaud,
of Me&s;&s;ieurs de la Condamine, du Clos, de S^t^e Palaye, de Bougainville,
Caperonnier, de Guignes, Suard, &amp;c. without attempting to di&s;cri|minate
the &s;hades of their characters, or the degrees of our connec|tion.
Alone, in a morning vi&s;it, I commonly found the arti&s;ts and
authors of Paris le&s;s vain, and more rea&s;onable, than in the circles
of their equals, with whom they mingle in the hou&s;es of the rich.
Four days in a week I had a place, without invitation, at the ho&s;|pitable
tables of Me&s;dames Geoffrin and du Bocage, of the cele|brated
Helvetius, and of the Baron d'Olbach. In the&s;e &s;ympo&s;ia
the plea&s;ures of the table were improved by lively and liberal con|ver&s;ation;

<P>The &s;ociety of Madame du Bocage was more &s;oft and moderate
than that of her rivals, and the evening conver&s;ations of M. de
Foncemagne were &s;upported by the good &s;en&s;e and learning of the
principal members of the Academy of In&s;criptions. The opera and
the Italians I occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited; but the French theatre, both in
<PB N="117" REF="142">
tragedy and comedy, was my daily and favourite amu&s;ement. Two
famous actre&s;&s;es then divided the public applau&s;e. For my own
part, I preferred the con&s;ummate art of the Clairon, to the intem|perate
&s;allies of the Dume&s;nil, which were extolled by her admirers,
as the genuine voice of nature and pa&s;&s;ion. Fourteen weeks in|&s;en&s;ibly
&s;tole away; but had I been rich and independent, I &s;hould
have prolonged, and perhaps have fixed, my re&s;idence at Paris.</P>
<P>Between the expen&s;ive &s;tyle of Paris and of Italy it was prudent
to interpo&s;e &s;ome months of tranquil &s;implicity; and at the thoughts
of Lau&s;anne I again lived in the plea&s;ures and &s;tudies of my early
youth. Shaping my cour&s;e through Dijon and Be&s;an&ccedil;on, in the
la&s;t of which places I was kindly entertained by my cou&s;in Acton, I
arrived in the month of May 1763 on the banks of the Leman
Lake. It had been my intention to pa&s;s the Alps in the autumn,
but &s;uch are the &s;imple attractions of the place, that the year had
almo&s;t expired before my departure from Lau&s;anne in the en&s;uing
&s;pring. An ab&s;ence of five years had not made much alteration in
manners, or even in per&s;ons. My old friends, of both &s;exes, hailed
my voluntary return; the mo&s;t genuine proof of my attachment.
They had been flattered by the pre&s;ent of my book, the produce of
their &s;oil; and the good Pavilliard &s;hed tears of joy as he embraced
a pupil, who&s;e literary merit he might fairly impute to his own
labours. To my old li&s;t I added &s;ome new acquaintance, and among
the &s;trangers I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h Prince Lewis of Wirtemberg, the
brother of the reigning Duke, at who&s;e country-hou&s;e, near Lau|&s;anne,
I frequently dined: a wandering meteor, and at length a
falling &s;tar, his light and ambitious &s;pirit had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively dropped
from the firmament of Pru&s;&s;ia, of France, and of Au&s;tria; and his
faults, which he &s;tiled his misfortunes, had driven him into philo&s;o|phic
exile in the Pais de Vaud. He could now moralize on the va|nity
of the world, the equality of mankind, and the happine&s;s of
a private &s;tation. His addre&s;s was affable and polite, and as he had
<PB N="118" REF="143">
&s;hone in courts and armies, his memory could &s;upply, and his elo|quence
could adorn, a copious fund of intere&s;ting anecdotes. His
fir&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m was that of charity and agriculture; but the &s;age
gradually lap&s;ed in the &s;aint, and Prince Lewis of Wirtemberg is
now buried in a hermitage near Mayence, in the la&s;t &s;tage of my&s;tic
devotion. By &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical quarrel, Voltaire had been pro|voked
to withdraw him&s;elf from Lau&s;anne, and retire to his ca&s;tle
at Ferney, where I again vi&s;ited the poet and the actor, without
&s;eeking his more intimate acquaintance, to which I might now have
pleaded a better title. But the theatre which he had founded, the
actors whom he had formed, &s;urvived the lo&s;s of their ma&s;ter; and
recent from Paris, I attended with plea&s;ure at the repre&s;entation of
&s;everal tragedies and comedies. I &s;hall not de&s;cend to &s;pecify par|ticular
names and characters; but I cannot forget a private in&s;titu|tion,
which will di&s;play the innocent freedom of Swi&s;s manners.
My favourite &s;ociety had a&s;&s;umed, from the age of its members, the
proud denomination of the &s;pring (<HI>la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute; du printems</HI>). It
con&s;i&s;ted of fifteen or twenty young unmarried ladies, of genteel,
though not of the very fir&s;t families; the elde&s;t perhaps about
twenty, all agreeable, &s;everal hand&s;ome, and two or three of ex|qui&s;ite
beauty. At each other's hou&s;es they a&s;&s;embled almo&s;t every day,
without the controul, or even the pre&s;ence, of a mother or an aunt;
they were tru&s;ted to their own prudence, among a crowd of young
men of every nation in Europe. They laughed, they &s;ung, they
danced, they played at cards, they acted comedies; but in the mid&s;t
of this carele&s;s gaiety, they re&s;pected them&s;elves, and were re&s;pected
by the men; the invi&s;ible line between liberty and licentiou&s;ne&s;s was
never trangre&s;&s;ed by a ge&s;ture, a word, or a look, and their virgin
cha&s;tity was never &s;ullied by the breath of &s;candal or &s;u&s;picion. A
&s;ingular in&s;titution, expre&s;&s;ive of the innocent &s;implicity of Swi&s;s man|ners.
After having ta&s;ted the luxury of England and Paris, I could not
have returned with &s;atisfaction to the coar&s;e and homely table of Ma|dame
<PB N="119" REF="144">
Pavilliard; nor was her hu&s;band offended that I now entered my|&s;elf
as a <HI>pen&s;ionaire,</HI> or boarder, in the elegant hou&s;e of Mr. De Me&s;ery,
which may be entitled to a &s;hort remembrance, as it has &s;tood above
twenty years, perhaps, without a parallel in Europe. The hou&s;e in
which we lodged was &s;pacious and convenient, in the be&s;t &s;treet, and
commanding, from behind, a noble pro&s;pect over the country and the
Lake. Our table was &s;erved with neatne&s;s and plenty; the boarders
were &s;elect; we had the liberty of inviting any gue&s;ts at a &s;tated
price; and in the &s;ummer the &s;cene was occa&s;ionally transferred to
a plea&s;ant villa, about a league from Lau&s;anne. The characters of
Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s were happily &s;uited to each other, and to their
&s;ituation. At the age of &s;eventy-five, Madame de Me&s;ery, who
has &s;urvived her hu&s;band, is &s;till a graceful, I had almo&s;t &s;aid a
hand&s;ome woman. She was alike qualified to pre&s;ide in her kitchen
and her drawing-room; and &s;uch was the equal propriety of her con|duct,
that of two or three hundred foreigners, none ever failed in
re&s;pect, none could complain of her neglect, and none could ever
boa&s;t of her favour. Me&s;ery him&s;elf, of the noble family of De
Crou&s;az, was a man of the world, a jovial companion, who&s;e ea&s;y
manners and natural fallies maintained the cheerfulne&s;s of his hou&s;e.
His wit could laugh at his own ignorance: he di&s;gui&s;ed, by an air
of profu&s;ion, a &s;trict attention to his intere&s;t; and in this &s;itu|ation,
he appeared like a nobleman who &s;pent his fortune and enter|tained
his friends. In this agreeable &s;ociety I re&s;ided nearly eleven
months (May 1763&mdash;April 1764); and in this &s;econd vi&s;it to Lau|&s;anne,
among a crowd of my Engli&s;h companions, I knew and
e&s;teemed Mr. Holroyd (now Lord Sheffield); and our mutual at|tachment
was renewed and fortified in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tages of our
Italian journey. Our lives are in the power of chance, and a &s;light
variation on either &s;ide, in time or place, might have deprived me
of a friend, who&s;e activity in the ardour of youth was always

<P>D&eacute;cembre 31^m^e.]&mdash;Jettons un coup d'oeil &s;ur cette ann&eacute;e 1763. Voyons com|ment j'ai employ&eacute; cette portion de mon exi&s;tence qui s'e&s;t &eacute;coul&eacute;e et qui ne re|viendra plus. Le mois de Janvier s'e&s;t pa&s;&s;&eacute; dans le &s;ein de ma famille &agrave; qui il falloit &s;acrifier tous mes momens, parcequ'ils &eacute;toient les derniers dans les &s;oins d'un d&eacute;part et dans l'embarras d'un voyage. Dans ce voyage cependant je trouvai moyen de lire les lettres de <HI>Bu&s;bequius,</HI> Mini&s;tre Imperial &agrave; la Porte. Elles &s;ont au&s;&s;i int&eacute;|re&s;&s;antes qu'in&s;tructives. Je re&s;tai &agrave; Paris depuis le 28 JANVIER ju&s;qu'au 9 MAI. Pendant tout ce tems je n'&eacute;tudiai point. Les amu&s;ements m'occupoient beaucoup, et l'habitude de la di&s;&s;ipation, qu'on prend &s;i facilement dans les grandes villes, ne me per|mettoient pas de mettre &agrave; pro&s;it le tems qui me demeuroit. A la verit&eacute;, &s;i j'ai peu feuillet&eacute; les livres, l'ob&s;ervation de tous les objets curieux qui &s;e pre&s;entent dans une grande capitale, et la conver&s;ation avec les plus grands hommes du &s;i&eacute;cle, m'ont in&s;truit de beaucoup de cho&s;es que je n'aurois point trouv&eacute; dans les livres. Les &s;ept ou huit derniers mois de cette ann&eacute;e ont &eacute;t&eacute; plus tranquilles. D&egrave;s que je me &s;uis vu etabli &agrave; Lau&s;anne, j'ai entrepris une &eacute;tude &s;uivie &s;ur la g&eacute;ographie ancienne de l'Italie. Mon ardeur s'e&s;t tr&egrave;s bien foutenue pendant &s;ix &s;emaines ju&s;qu'&agrave; la fin du mois de Juin. Ce fut alors qu'un voyage de Geneve interrompit un peu mon a&s;&s;iduit&eacute;, que le &s;ejour de Me&s;ery m'o&s;&s;rit mille di&s;tractions, et que la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute; de Sau&s;&s;ure acheva de me faire perdre mon tems. Je repris mon travail avec ce Journal au milieu <HI>d'Aout,</HI> et depuis ce tems, ju&s;qu'au commencement de <HI>Novembre,</HI> j'ai mis a profit tous mes in&s;tans; j'avoue que pendant les deux derniers mois mon ardeur s'e&s;t un peu rallantie.

L'<HI>Italia Antiqua</HI> de Cluvier, en deux volumes in folio. 8. L'<HI>Iter</HI> ou le Voyage de Cl. Rutillius Numatianus dans les Gaules. 9. Les Catalogues de Virgile. 10. Celui de Silius Italicus. 11. Le Voyage d'Horace a Brundu&s;ium. N. B. J'ai lu deux fois ces trois deruiers morceaux. 12. Le Trait&eacute; &s;ur les Me&s;ures Itineraires par M. d'Anville, et quelques Memoires de l'Academie des Belles Lettres. II^m^e^n^t, On me fit attendre Nardini de la Bibliotheque de Geneve. Je voulus remplir ce moment de vuide par la lecture de <HI>Juvenal,</HI> po&euml;te qui je ne con|noi&s;&s;ois encore que de r&eacute;putation. Je le lu deux fois avec plai&s;ir et avec &s;oin. III^m^e^n^t, Pendant l'ann&eacute;e j'ai lu quelques journaux, entre autres le Journal Etranger depuis &s;on commencement, un tome des Nouvelles de Bayle, et les xxxv premiers volumes de la Bibliotheque rai&s;onn&eacute;e. IV^m^e^n^t, J'ai beaucoup ecrit de mon Recueil G&eacute;ographique de l'Italie qui e&s;t deja bien ample et a&s;&s;ez curieux. V^m^e^n^t, Je ne dois point oublier ce journal m&ecirc;me qui e&s;t devenu un ouvrage; 214 pages en quatre mois et demi et des pages des mieux fournies font un objet con&s;iderable. Au&s;&s;i &s;ans compter un grand nombre d'ob&s;ervations d&eacute;tach&eacute;es, il s'y trouve des di&s;&s;ertations &s;avantes et rai&s;on&eacute;es. Celle du pa&s;&s;age d'Annibal contient dix pages, et celle &s;ur le guerre &s;ociale en a douze. Mais ces morceaux &s;ont trop etendus, et le journal m&ecirc;me a be&s;oin d'une reforme qui lui retranche quantit&eacute; de pieces qui &s;ont a&s;&s;ez &eacute;trangeres &agrave; &s;on veritable plan. Apr&egrave;s avoir un peu reflechi l&agrave; de&s;&s;us, voici quelques regles que je me &s;uis faites &s;ur les objets qui lui conviennent. I^m^e^n^t, Toute ma vie civile et priv&eacute;e, mes amu&s;emens, mes liai&s;ons, mes ecarts m&ecirc;me, et toutes mes r&eacute;fl&eacute;xions qui ne roulent que &s;ur des &s;ujets qui me &s;ont per&s;onels, je conviens que tout cela n'e&s;t intere&s;&s;ant que pour moi, mais au&s;&s;i ce n'e&s;t que pour moi que j'ecris mon journal. II^m^e^n^t, Tout ce que j'apprens par l'ob&s;ervation ou la conver&s;ation. A l'egard de celle-ci je ne rapporterai que ce que je tiens de per|&s;onnes tout &agrave; la &s;ois in&s;truites et v&eacute;ridiques, lor&s;qu'il e&s;t que&s;tion de faits, ou du petit nombre de ceux qui meritent le titre de grand homme, s'il s'agit de &s;entimens et d'opi|nions. III^m^e^n^t, J'y mettrai &s;oigneu&s;ement tout ce qu'on peut appeller la partie ma|terielle de mes &eacute;tudes; combien d'heures j'ai travaill&eacute;, combien de pages j'ai ecrit ou lu, avec une courte notice du &s;ujet qu'elles contenoient. IV^m^e^n^t, Je &s;erois fach&eacute; de lire fans r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir &s;ur mes lectures, &s;ans porter des jugemens rai&s;onn&eacute;s &s;ur mes auteurs, et &s;ans &eacute;plucher avec &s;oin leurs id&eacute;es et leurs expre&s;&s;ions. Mais toute lecture ne fournit pas egalement. Il y a des livres qu'on parcourt, et il y en a qu'on lit; il y en a enfin qu'on doit &eacute;tudier. Mes ob&s;ervations &s;ur ceux de la premiere cla&s;&s;e no peuvent qu'etre courtes et detach&eacute;es. Elles conviennent au journal. Celles qui re|gardent la &s;econde cla&s;&s;e n'y entreront qu'autant qu'elles auront le m&ecirc;me caract&egrave;re. V^m^e^n^t, Mes r&eacute;fl&eacute;xions &s;ur ce petit nombre d'auteurs cla&s;&s;iques, qu'on medite avec &s;oin, &s;eront naturellement plus approfondies et plus &s;uivies. C'e&s;t pour elles, et pour des pieces plus etendues et plus originales, aux quelles la lecture ou la meditation peut donner lieu, que je &s;erai un recueil &s;&eacute;par&eacute;. Je con&s;erverai cependant fa liai&s;on avec le journal par des renvois con&s;tans qui marqueront le numero de chaque piece avec le tems et l'occa&s;ion de &s;a compo&s;ition. Moyennant ces pr&eacute;cautions mon journal ne peut que m'&egrave;tre utile. Ce compte exact de mon tems m'en &s;era mieux &s;entir le prix; il di&s;&s;i|pera par &s;on detail, l'illu&s;ion qu'on &s;e fait d'invi&s;ager &s;eulement les ann&eacute;es et les mois et de mepri&s;er les heures et les jours. Je ne dis rien de l'agr&eacute;ment. C'en e&s;t un bien grand cependant de pouvoir repa&s;&s;er chaque epoque de &s;a vie, et de &s;e placer, d&egrave;s qu'on le veut, au milieu de toutes les petites &s;cenes qu'on a jou&eacute;, ou qu'on a vu jouer.</P>

Au d&eacute;&s;e&s;poir de voir mon ami engag&eacute; dans une affaire qui ne pouvoit que lui faire du tort, j'ai couru chez M. de Crou&s;az o&ugrave; demeuroit * * * * * *. J'ai bientot vu qu'il ne lui falloit qu'une explication a&s;&s;ez l&eacute;gere, jointe a quelque apologie de la part de G * * * * pour le d&eacute;&s;armer, et je &s;uis retourn&eacute; chez lui avec H * * * * pour l'en|gager a la donner. Nous lui avons fait comprendre que l'aveu d'une veritable tort ne ble&s;&s;oit jamais l'honneur, et que &s;on in&s;ulte envers les dames au&s;&s;i bien qu'envers * * * * * &eacute;toit &s;ans excu&s;e. Je lui ai dict&eacute; un billet convenable, mais &s;ans la moindre ba&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, que j'ai port&eacute; au Hollandois. Il a rendu les armes &s;ur le champ, lui a fait la r&eacute;pon&s;e la plus polie, et m'a remerci&eacute; mille fois du r&ocirc;le que j'avois fait. En v&eacute;rit&eacute; cet homme n'e&s;t pas di&s;&s;icile. Apr&egrave;s diner j'ai vu nos dames &agrave; qui j'ai port&eacute; une lettre d'excu&s;es. La mere n'en veut plus a G * * * *, mais Mademoifelle * * * * * * e&s;t de&s;ol&eacute;e du tort que certe affaire peut lui faire dans le monde. Cette n&eacute;gociation m'a pris le jour entier; mais peut on mieux employer un jour qu'&agrave; &s;auver la vie, peut&ecirc;tre a deux per&s;onnes, et a con&s;erver la r&eacute;putation d'un ami? Au re&s;te j'ai vu au fond plus d'un caract&eacute;re. G * * * * * e&s;t brave, vrai, et &s;ens&eacute;, mais d'une imp&eacute;tuo&s;it&eacute; qui n'e&s;t que plus dan|gereu&s;e pour &ecirc;tre &s;upprim&eacute;e a l'ordinaire. C * * * * * e&s;t d'une &eacute;tourderie d'enfant. De S * * * * d'une indifference qui vient bien plus d'un d&eacute;faut de &s;en&s;ibilit&eacute;, que d'un exc&egrave;s de rai&s;on.

Greek abbreviations and Gothic alphabets, &s;ince every day, in a fa|miliar
language, I am at a lo&s;s to decypher the hieroglyphics of a
female note. In a tranquil &s;cene, which revived the memory of my
fir&s;t &s;tudies, idlene&s;s would have been le&s;s pardonable: the public
libraries of Lau&s;anne and Geneva liberally &s;upplied me with books;
and if many hours were lo&s;t in di&s;&s;ipation, many more were em|ployed
in literary labour. In the country, Horace and Virgil, Ju|venal
and Ovid, were my a&s;&s;iduous companions: but, in town, I
formed and executed a plan of &s;tudy for the u&s;e of my Tran&s;alpine
expedition: the topography of old Rome, the ancient geography of
Italy, and the &s;cience of medals. 1. I diligently read, almo&s;t always
with my pen in my hand, the elaborate treati&s;es of Nardini, Donatus,
&amp;c. which fill the fourth volume of the Roman Antiquities of
Graevius. 2. I next undertook and fini&s;hed the <HI>Italia Antiqua</HI> of
Cluverius, a learned native of Pru&s;&s;ia, who had mea&s;ured, on foot,
every &s;pot, and has compiled and dige&s;ted every pa&s;&s;age of the
ancient writers. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in Greek or Latin authors I peru&s;ed
in the text of Cluverius, in two folio volumes: but I &s;eparately read
the de&s;criptions of Italy by Strabo, Pliny, and Pomponius Mela, the
Catalogues of the Epic poets, the Itineraries of We&s;&s;eling's Anto|ninus,
and the coa&s;ting Voyage of Rutilius Numatianus; and I &s;tudied
two kindred &s;ubjects in the Me&s;ures Itineraires of d'Anville, and the
copious work of Bergier, <HI>Hi&s;toire des grands Chemins de l'Empire
Romain.</HI> From the&s;e materials I formed a table of roads and di&s;tances
reduced to our Engli&s;h mea&s;ure; filled a folio common-place book
with my collections and remarks on the geography of Italy; and in|ferted
in my journal many long and learned notes on the in&s;ulae and
populou&s;ne&s;s of Rome, the &s;ocial war, the pa&s;&s;age of the Alps by
Hannibal, &amp;c. 3. After glancing my eye over Addi&s;on's agreeable
dialogues, I more &s;eriou&s;ly read the great work of Ezechiel Spanheim
<HI>de Prae&s;tanti&acirc; et U&s;&ugrave; Numi&s;matum,</HI> and applied with him the medals

Je leur ai dit cent folies, et nous nous &s;ommes embra&s;&s;&eacute;s en riant. Me&s;ery nous a donn&eacute; un tr&egrave;s beau &s;ouper avec une partie de la compagnie du matin, augment&eacute;e de Bourgeois et de Pavilliard. Ce &s;ouper, les adieux &s;ur tout a Pavilliard, que j'aime v&eacute;ritablement, et les pr&eacute;parati&s;s du d&eacute;part, m'ont occup&eacute; ju&s;qu'a deux heures du matin.</P>
<P>Je quitte Lau&s;anne avec moins de regret que la premi&egrave;re fois. Je n'y lai&s;&s;e plus que des connoi&s;&s;ances. C'etoit la maitre&s;&s;e et l'ami dont je pleurois la perte. D'ail|lieurs je voyois Lau&s;anne avec les yeux encore novices d'un jeune homme, qui lui devoit la partie rai&s;onable de fon exi&s;tence, et qui jugeoit fans objets de compa|rai&s;on. Aujourdhui j'y vois une ville mal batie, au milieu d'un pays delicieux, qui jouit de la paix et du repos, et qui les prend pour la libert&eacute;. Un peuple nombreux et bien &eacute;lev&eacute;, qui aime la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;, qui y e&s;t propre, et qui admet avec plai&s;ir les &eacute;trangers dans &s;es cotteries, qui &s;eroient bien plus agr&eacute;ables, &s;i la conver&s;ation n'avoit pas c&eacute;d&eacute; la place au jeu. Les &s;emmes &s;ont jolies, et malgr&eacute; leur grande libert&eacute;, elles &s;ont tr&egrave;s &s;ages. Tout au plus peuvent elles &ecirc;tre un peu complai&s;antes, dans l'id&eacute;e honn&ecirc;te, mais incertaine, de rendre un &eacute;tranger dans leurs &s;ilets. L'affectation e&s;t le p&eacute;ch&eacute; originel des Lau&s;annois. Affectation de depen&s;e, affectation de noble&s;&s;e, affectation d'e&s;prit: les deux premi&eacute;res &s;ont fort repandues, pendant que la troi&s;i&eacute;me e&s;t fort rare. Comme ce vice &s;e choque a tout in&s;tant avec celui des autres, Lau&s;anne &s;e trouve partag&eacute;e dans un grand nombre d'etats, dont les principes et le langage varient a l'infini, et qui n'ont de commun que leur mepris reciproque les uns pour les autres. Leur gout pour la depen&s;e s'accorde mal avec celui de la noble&s;&s;e. Ils p&eacute;riroient plutot que de renoncer a leurs grandeurs, ou d'embra&s;&s;er la &s;eule profe&s;&s;ion qui pui&s;&s;e les y &s;outenir. La mai&s;on de M. De Me&s;ery e&s;t charmante: le caract&eacute;re franc et genereux du Mari, les agr&eacute;mens de la femme, une &s;ituation d&eacute;licieu&s;e, une chere ex|cellente, la compagnie de &s;es compatriotes, et une libert&eacute; parfaite, font aimer ce &s;&eacute;jour a tout Anglois. Que je voudrois en trouver un &s;emblable a Londres! J'y regrette encore Holroyd, mais il nous &s;uit de pr&egrave;s.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I &s;hall advance with rapid brevity in the narrative of this tour, in
which &s;omewhat more than a year (April 1764&mdash;May 1765) was
agreeably employed. Content with tracing my line of march, and
&s;lightly touching on my per&s;onal feelings, I &s;hall wave the minute
inve&s;tigation of the &s;cenes which have been viewed by thou&s;ands,
and de&s;cribed by hundreds, of our modern travellers. ROME is the
<PB N="126" REF="151">
great object of our pilgrimage: and 1&s;t, the journey; 2d, the re&s;i|dence;
and 3d, the return; will form the mo&s;t proper and per&s;pi|cuous
divi&s;ion. 1. I climbed Mount Cenis, and de&s;cended into the
plain of Piedmont, not on the back of an elephant, but on a light
o&s;ier &s;eat, in the hands of the dextrous and intrepid chairmen of the
Alps. The architecture and government of Turin pre&s;ented the
&s;ame a&s;pect of tame and tire&s;ome uniformity: but the court was re|gulated
with decent and &s;plendid oeconomy; and I was introduced
to his Sardinian maje&s;ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letter, No. XII.</NOTE> Charles Emanuel, who, after the incom|parable
Frederic, held the &s;econd rank (proximus longo tamen inter|vallo)
among the kings of Europe. The &s;ize and populou&s;ne&s;s of
Milan could not &s;urpri&s;e an inhabitant of London: but the fancy is
amu&s;ed by a vi&s;it to the Boromean I&s;lands, an enchanted palace, a
work of the fairies in the mid&s;t of a lake encompa&s;&s;ed with moun|tains,
and far removed from the haunts of men. I was le&s;s amu&s;ed
by the marble palaces of Genoa, than by the recent memorials of her
deliverance (in December 1746) from the Au&s;trian tyranny; and I
took a military &s;urvey of every &s;cene of action within the inclo&s;ure
of her double walls. My &s;teps were detained at Parma and Modena,
by the precious relics of the Farne&s;e and E&s;te collections: but, alas!
the far greater part had been already tran&s;ported, by inheritance or
purcha&s;e, to Naples and Dre&s;den. By the road of Bologna and the
Apennine I at la&s;t reached Florence, where I repo&s;ed from June to
September, during the heat of the &s;ummer months. In the Gallery,
and e&s;pecially in the Tribune, I fir&s;t acknowledged, at the feet of
the Venus of Medicis, that the chi&s;&s;el may di&s;pute the pre-eminence
with the pencil, a truth in the fine arts which cannot on this &s;ide of
the Alps be felt or under&s;tood. At home I had taken &s;ome le&s;&s;ons
of Italian: on the &s;pot I read, with a learned native, the cla&s;&s;ics of
the Tu&s;can idiom: but the &s;hortne&s;s of my time, and the u&s;e of the
<PB N="127" REF="152">
French language, prevented my acquiring any facility of &s;peaking;
and I was a &s;ilent &s;pectator in the conver&s;ations of our envoy, Sir
Horace Mann, who&s;e mo&s;t &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s was that of entertaining
the Engli&s;h at his ho&s;pitable table<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOURNAL, Florence, Aout 9^m^e, 1764.]&mdash;Cocchi &agrave; din&eacute; avec nous. Nous avons beaucoup cau&s;&eacute;, mais je ne lui trouve pas le genie qu'on lui attribue, c'e&s;t peut&ecirc;tre, parceque les notres ne &s;ont pas analogues. J'entrevois de l'extravagance dans &s;es id&eacute;es, de l'affectation dans &s;es mani&eacute;res. Il &s;e plaint &agrave; tout moment de &s;a pauvret&eacute;. Il connoit peu la veritable dignit&eacute; d'un homme de lettres. S'il a beaucoup de &s;cience, elle e&s;t born&eacute;e &agrave; la phy&s;ique. Il m'a demand&eacute; &s;i Lord Spen&s;er ne pouvoit pas faire des &eacute;veques, et m'a fait un conte de Lord Lyttelton (dont il ne peut &s;ouffrir le fils) ou il &eacute;toit que&s;tion des Parlemens de Campagne.</NOTE>. After leaving Florence, I com|pared
the &s;olitude of Pi&s;a with the indu&s;try of Lucca and Leghorn,
and continued my journey through Sienna to Rome, where I arrived
in the beginning of October. 2. My temper is not very &s;u&s;ceptible
of enthu&s;ia&s;m; and the enthu&s;ia&s;m which I do not feel, I have ever
&s;corned to affect. But, at the di&s;tance of twenty-five years, I can
neither forget nor expre&s;s the &s;trong emotions which agitated my
mind as I fir&s;t approached and entered the <HI>eternal city.</HI> After a &s;leep|le&s;s
night, I trod, with a lofty &s;tep, the ruins of the Forum; each
memorable &s;pot where Romulus <HI>&s;tood,</HI> or Tully &s;poke, or Cae&s;ar fell,
was at once pre&s;ent to my eye; and &s;everal days of intoxication
were lo&s;t or enjoyed before I could de&s;cend to a cool and minute in|ve&s;tigation.
My guide was Mr. Byers, a Scotch antiquary of experi|ence
and ta&s;te; but, in the daily labour of eighteen weeks, the
powers of attention were &s;ometimes fatigued, till I was my&s;elf qua|lified,
in a la&s;t review, to &s;elect and &s;tudy the capital works of
ancient and modern art. Six weeks were borrowed for my tour of
Naples, the mo&s;t populous of cities, relative to its &s;ize, who&s;e luxu|rious
inhabitants &s;eem to dwell on the con&s;ines of paradi&s;e and hell|&s;ire.
I was pre&s;ented to the boy-king by our new envoy, Sir William
Hamilton; who, wi&s;ely diverting his corre&s;pondence from the Se|cretary
of State to the Royal Society and Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, has eluci|dated
<PB N="128" REF="153">
a country of &s;uch ine&s;timable value to the naturali&s;t and anti|quarian.
On my return, I fondly embraced, for the la&s;t time, the
miracles of Rome; but I departed without ki&s;&s;ing the feet of Rezzo|nico
(Clement XIII.), who neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the wit of his prede|ce&s;&s;or
Lambertini, nor the virtues of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Ganganelli. 3. In
my pilgrimage from Rome to Loretto I again cro&s;&s;ed the Apennine;
from the coa&s;t of the Adriatic I traver&s;ed a fruitful and populous
country, which could alone di&s;prove the paradox of Monte&s;quieu,
that modern Italy is a de&s;ert. Without adopting the exclu&s;ive pre|judice
of the natives, I &s;incerely admire the paintings of the Bologna
&s;chool. I ha&s;tened to e&s;cape from the &s;ad &s;olitude of Ferrara, which
in the age of Cae&s;ar was &s;till more de&s;olate. The &s;pectacle of Ve|nice
afforded &s;ome hours of a&s;toni&s;hment; the univer&s;ity of Padua
is a dying taper: but Verona &s;till boa&s;ts her amphitheatre, and his
native Vicenza is adorned by the cla&s;&s;ic architecture of Palladio:
the road of Lombardy and Piedmont (did Monte&s;quieu find them
without inhabitants?) led me back to Milan, Turin, and the pa&s;&s;age
of Mount Cenis, where I again cro&s;&s;ed the Alps in my way to
Lyons.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of foreign travel has been often debated as a general
que&s;tion; but the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be finally applied to the character
and circum&s;tances of each individual. With the education of boys,
<HI>where</HI> or <HI>how</HI> they may pa&s;s over &s;ome juvenile years with the lea&s;t
mi&s;chief to them&s;elves or others, I have no concern. But after &s;up|po&s;ing
the previous and indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ites of age, judgment, a
competent knowledge of men and books, and a freedom from do|me&s;tic
prejudices, I will briefly de&s;cribe the qualifications which I
deem mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to a traveller. He &s;hould be endowed with
an active, indefatigable vigour of mind and body, which can &s;eize
every mode of conveyance, and &s;upport, with a carele&s;s &s;mile, every
hard&s;hip of the road, the weather, or the inn. The benefits of foreign
travel will corre&s;pond with the degrees of the&s;e qualifications; but,
<PB N="129" REF="154">
in this &s;ketch, tho&s;e to whom I am known will not accu&s;e me of
framing my own panegyric. It was at Rome, on the 15th of Octo|ber
1764, as I &s;at mu&s;ing amid&s;t the ruins of the Capitol, while the
bare-footed fryars were &s;inging ve&s;pers in the Temple of Jupiter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now the church of the Zoccolants, or Franci&s;can Friars.</NOTE>,
that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city fir&s;t &s;tarted to
my mind. But my original plan was circum&s;cribed to the decay of
the city rather than of the empire: and, though my reading and re|flections
began to point towards that object, &s;ome years elap&s;ed, and
&s;everal avocations intervened, before I was &s;eriou&s;ly engaged in the
execution of that laborious work.</P>
<P>I had not totally renounced the &s;outhern provinces of France, but
the letters which I found at Lyons were expre&s;&s;ive of &s;ome impa|tience.
Rome and Italy had &s;atiared my curious appetite, and I was
now ready to return to the peaceful retreat of my family and books.
After a happy fortnight I reluctantly left Paris, embarked at Calais,
again landed at Dover, after an interval of two years and five months,
and ha&s;tily drove through the &s;ummer du&s;t and &s;olitude of London.
On the 25th of June 1765 I arrived at my father's hou&s;e: and the
five years and a half between my travels and my father's death (1770)
are the portion of my life which I pa&s;&s;ed with the lea&s;t enjoyment,
and which I remember with the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction. Every &s;pring I
attended the monthly meeting and exerci&s;e of the militia at South|ampton;
and by the re&s;ignation of my father, and the death of Sir
Thomas Wor&s;ley, I was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively promoted to the rank of major
and lieutenant-colonel commandant: but I was each year more di&s;|gu&s;ted
with the inn, the wine, the company, and the tire&s;ome repe|tition
of annual attendance and daily exerci&s;e. At home, the oeco|nomy
of the family and farm &s;till maintained the &s;ame creditable ap|pearance.
My connection with Mrs. Gibbon was mellowed into a
warm and &s;olid attachment: my growing years aboli&s;hed the di&s;tance
<PB N="130" REF="155">
that might yet remain between a parent and a &s;on, and my beha|viour
&s;atisfied my father, who was proud of the &s;ucce&s;s, however
imperfect in his own life-time, of my literary talents. Our &s;oli|tude
was &s;oon and often enlivened by the vi&s;it of the friend of my
youth, Mr. Deyverdun, who&s;e ab&s;ence from Lau&s;anne I had &s;incerely
lamented. About three years after my fir&s;t departure, he had emi|grated
from his native lake to the banks of the Oder in Germany.
The <HI>res angu&s;ta domi,</HI> the wa&s;te of a decent patrimony, by an impro|vident
father, obliged him, like many of his countrymen, to con|fide
in his own indu&s;try; and he was entru&s;ted with the education
of a young prince, the grand&s;on of the Margrave of Schavedt, of
the Royal Family of Pru&s;&s;ia. Our friend&s;hip was never cooled, our
corre&s;pondence was &s;ometimes interrupted; but I rather wi&s;hed than
hoped to obtain Mr. Deyverdun for the companion of my Italian
tour. An unhappy, though honourable pa&s;&s;ion, drove him from his
German court; and the attractions of hope and curio&s;ity were for|tified
by the expectation of my &s;peedy return to England. During
four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ummers he pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal weeks or months at Beri|ton,
and our free conver&s;ations, on every topic that could intere&s;t
the heart or under&s;tanding, would have reconciled me to a de&s;ert or
a pri&s;on. In the winter months of London my &s;phere of know|ledge
and action was &s;omewhat enlarged, by the many new ac|quaintance
which I had contracted in the militia and abroad; and I
mu&s;t regret, as more than an acquaintance, Mr. Godfrey Clarke of
Derby&s;hire, an amiable and worthy young man, who was &s;natched
away by an untimely death. A weekly convivial meeting was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
by my&s;elf and travellers, under the name of the Roman
Club<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The members were Lord Mount&s;tuart (now Earl of Bute), Colonel Edmon&s;tone, Weddal, Palgrave, Lord Berkley, Godfrey Clarke, Holroyd (Lord She&s;field), Major Ridley, Sir William Guize, Sir John Aubrey, Lord Abingdon, Hon. Peregrine Bertie, Cleaver, Hon. John Damer, Hon. George Damer (Lord Milton), Sir Thomas Ga&s;|coygne, Sir John Hort, E. Gibbon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="156">
The renewal, or perhaps the improvement, of my Engli&s;h life
was embittered by the alteration of my own feelings. At the age
of twenty-one I was, in my proper &s;tation of a youth, delivered
from the yoke of education, and delighted with the comparative
&s;tate of liberty and affluence. My &s;ilial obedience was natural and
ea&s;y; and in the gay pro&s;pect of futurity, my ambition did not ex|tend
beyond the enjoyment of my books, my lei&s;ure, and my pa|trimonial
e&s;tate, undi&s;turbed by the cares of a family and the duties
of a profe&s;&s;ion. But in the militia I was armed with power; in my
travels, I was exempt from controul; and as I approached, as I
gradually pa&s;&s;ed my thirtieth year, I began to feel the de&s;ire of
being ma&s;ter in my own hou&s;e. The mo&s;t gentle authority will
&s;ometimes frown without rea&s;on, the mo&s;t cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion will
&s;ometimes murmur without cau&s;e; and &s;uch is the law of our im|perfect
nature, that we mu&s;t either command or obey; that our
per&s;onal liberty is &s;upported by the ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of our own de|pendants.
While &s;o many of my acquaintance were married or in
parliament, or advancing with a rapid &s;tep in the various roads of
honour and fortune, I &s;tood alone, immoveable and in&s;ignificant;
for after the monthly meeting of 1770, I had even withdrawn my|&s;elf
from the militia, by the re&s;ignation of an empty and barren
commi&s;&s;ion. My temper is not &s;u&s;ceptible of envy, and the view
of &s;ucce&s;sful merit has always excited my warme&s;t applau&s;e. The
mi&s;eries of a vacant life were never known to a man who&s;e hours
were in&s;ufficient for the inexhau&s;tible plea&s;ures of &s;tudy. But I
lamented that at the proper age I had not embraced the lucrative
pur&s;uits of the law or of trade, the chances of civil office or India
adventure, or even the fat &s;lumbers of the church; and my repent|ance
became more lively as the lo&s;s of time was more irretrievable.
Experience &s;hewed me the u&s;e of grafting my private con&s;equence
on the importance of a great profe&s;&s;ional body; the benefits of tho&s;e
firm connections which are cemented by hope and intere&s;t, by grati|tude
<PB N="132" REF="157">
and emulation, by the mutual exchange of &s;ervices and favours.
From the emoluments of a profe&s;&s;ion I might have derived an ample
fortune, or a competent income, in&s;tead of being &s;tinted to the &s;ame
narrow allowance, to be increa&s;ed only by an event which I &s;incerely
deprecated. The progre&s;s and the knowledge of our dome&s;tic di&s;|orders
aggravated my anxiety, and I began to apprehend that I
might be left in my old age without the fruits either of indu&s;try or
inheritance.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;ummer after my return, whil&s;t I enjoyed at Beriton
the &s;ociety of my friend Deyverdun, our daily conver&s;ations expa|tiated
over the field of antient and modern literature; and we freely
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed my &s;tudies, my fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay, and my future projects. The
Decline and Fall of Rome I &s;till contemplated at an awful di&s;tance:
but the two hi&s;torical de&s;igns which had balanced my choice were
&s;ubmitted to his ta&s;te; and in the parallel between the Revolutions
of Florence and Switzerland, our common partiality for a country
which was <HI>his</HI> by birth, and <HI>mine</HI> by adoption, inclined the &s;cale in
favour of the latter. According to the plan, which was &s;oon con|ceived
and dige&s;ted, I embraced a period of two hundred years,
from the a&s;&s;ociation of the three pea&s;ants of the Alps to the plenitude
and pro&s;perity of the Helvetic body in the &s;ixteenth century. I
&s;hould have de&s;cribed the deliverance and victory of the Swi&s;s, who
have never &s;hed the blood of their tyrants but in a field of battle;
the laws and manners of the confederate &s;tates; the &s;plendid tro|phies
of the Au&s;trian, Burgundian, and Italian wars; and the wi&s;|dom
of a nation, who, after &s;ome &s;allies of martial adventure, has
been content to guard the ble&s;&s;ings of peace with the &s;word of
freedom.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Manus haec inimica tyrannis</L>
<L>En&s;e petit placidam &s;ub libertate quietem.</L></Q>
<P>My judgment, as well as my enthu&s;ia&s;m, was &s;atisfied with the
glorious theme; and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Deyverdun &s;eemed to remove
<PB N="133" REF="158">
an in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle. The French or Latin memorials, of which
I was not ignorant, are incon&s;iderable in number and weight; but
in the perfect acquaintance of my friend with the German language,
I found the key of a more valuable collection. The mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary
books were procured; he tran&s;lated, for my u&s;e, the folio volume of
Schilling, a copious and contemporary relation of the war of Bur|gundy;
we read and marked the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of the great
chronicle of T&s;chudi; and by his labour, or that of an inferior a&s;|&s;i&s;tant,
large extracts were made from the Hi&s;tory of Lauffer and
the Dictionary of Lew: yet &s;uch was the di&s;tance and delay, that
two years elap&s;ed in the&s;e preparatory &s;teps; and it was late in the
third &s;ummer (1767) before I entered, with the&s;e &s;lender materials,
on the more agreeable ta&s;k of compo&s;ition. A &s;pecimen of my
Hi&s;tory, the fir&s;t book, was read the following winter in a literary
&s;ociety of foreigners in London; and as the author was unknown,
I li&s;tened, without ob&s;ervation, to the free &s;trictures, and unfavour|able
&s;entence, of my judges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Hume &s;eems to have had a different opinion of this work.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is but a few days ago &s;ince M. Deyverdun put your manu&s;cript into my hands, and I have peru&s;ed it with great plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. I have only one objec|tion, derived from the language in which it is written. Why do you compo&s;e in French, and carry faggots into the wood, as Horace &s;ays with regard to Romans who wrote in Greek? I grant that you have a like motive to tho&s;e Romans, and adopt a language much more generally diffu&s;ed than your native tongue: but have you not remarked the fate of tho&s;e two ancient languages in following ages? The Latin, though then le&s;s celebrated, and con&s;ined to more narrow limits, has in &s;ome mea&s;ure outlived the Greek, and is now more generally under&s;tood by men of letters. Let the French, therefore, triumph in the pre&s;ent di&s;&s;u&s;ion of their tongue. Our &s;olid and increa&s;ing e&s;tabli&s;hments in America, where we need le&s;s dread the inun|dation of Barbarians, promi&s;e a &s;uperior &s;tability and duration to the Engli&s;h lan|guage.</P>
<P>Your u&s;e of the French tongue has al&s;o led you into a &s;tyle more poetical and figurative, and more highly coloured, than our language &s;eems to admit of in hi&s;to|rical productions: for &s;uch is the practice of French writers, particularly the more recent ones, who illuminate their pictures more than cu&s;tom will permit us. On the whole, your Hi&s;tory, in my opinion, is written with &s;pirit and judgment; and I ex|hort you very earne&s;tly to continue it. The objections that occurred to me on reading it, were &s;o frivolous, that I &s;hall not trouble you with them, and &s;hould, I believe, have a difficulty to recollect them. I am, with great e&s;teem,</P>

</LETTER></NOTE>. The momentary &s;en&s;ation was pain|ful;
<PB N="134" REF="159">
but their condemnation was ratified by my cooler thoughts.
I delivered my imperfect &s;heets to the flames<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He neglected to burn them. He left at Sheffield-Place the introduction, or fir&s;t book, in forty-three pages folio, written in a very &s;mall hand, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number of notes. If Mr. Gibbon had not declared his judgment, perhaps Mr. Hume's opinion, expre&s;&s;ed in the letter in the la&s;t note, might have ju&s;tified the pub|lication of it. S.</NOTE>, and forever re|nounced
a de&s;ign in which &s;ome expence, much labour, and more
time, had been &s;o vainly con&s;umed. I cannot regret the lo&s;s of a
&s;light and &s;uperficial e&s;&s;ay; for &s;uch the work mu&s;t have been in
the hands of a &s;tranger, uninformed by the &s;cholars and &s;tate&s;men,
and remote from the libraries and archives of the Swi&s;s republics.
My antient habits, and the pre&s;ence of Deyverdun, encouraged me to
write in French for the continent of Europe; but I was con&s;cious
my&s;elf that my &s;tyle, above pro&s;e and below poetry, degenerated
into a verbo&s;e and turgid declamation. Perhaps I may impute the
failure to the injudicious choice of a foreign language. Perhaps I
may &s;u&s;pect that the language it&s;elf is ill adapted to &s;u&s;tain the
vigour and dignity of an important narrative. But if France, &s;o
rich in literary merit, had produced a great original hi&s;torian, his
genius would have formed and fixed the idiom to the proper tone,
the peculiar mode of hi&s;torical eloquence.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="160">
It was in &s;earch of &s;ome liberal and lucrative employment that my
friend Deyverdun had vi&s;ited England. His remittances from home
were &s;canty and precarious. My pur&s;e was always open, but it was
often empty; and I bitterly felt the want of riches and power,
which might have enabled me to correct the errors of his fortune.
His wi&s;hes and qualifications &s;olicited the &s;tation of the travelling
governor of &s;ome wealthy pupil; but every vacancy provoked &s;o
many eager candidates, that for a long time I &s;truggled without
&s;ucce&s;s; nor was it till after much application that I could even
place him as a clerk in the office of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate. In a
re&s;idence of &s;everal years he never acquired the ju&s;t pronunciation
and familiar u&s;e of the Engli&s;h tongue, but he read our mo&s;t dif|ficult
authors with ea&s;e and ta&s;te: his critical knowledge of our
language and poetry was &s;uch as few foreigners have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and
few of our countrymen could enjoy the theatre of Shake&s;peare and
Garrick with more exqui&s;ite feeling and di&s;cernment. The con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
of his own &s;trength, and the a&s;&s;urance of my aid, embold|ened
him to imitate the example of Dr. Maty, who&s;e <HI>Journal Bri|tannique</HI>
was e&s;teemed and regretted; and to improve his model, by
uniting with the tran&s;actions of literature a philo&s;ophic view of the
arts and manners of the Briti&s;h nation. Our Journal for the year
1767, under the title of <HI>Memoires Literaires de la Grand Bretagne,</HI>
was &s;oon fini&s;hed and &s;ent to the pre&s;s. For the fir&s;t article, Lord
Lyttelton's Hi&s;tory of Henry II. I mu&s;t own my&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible;
but the public has ratified my judgment of that voluminous work,
in which &s;en&s;e and learning are not illuminated by a ray of genius.
The next &s;pecimen was the choice of my friend, <HI>the Bath Guide,</HI>
a light and whim&s;ical performance, of local, and even verbal, plea|&s;antry.
I &s;tarted at the attempt: he &s;miled at my fears: his courage
was ju&s;tified by &s;ucce&s;s; and a ma&s;ter of both languages will ap|plaud
the curious felicity with which he has transfu&s;ed into French
<PB N="136" REF="161">
pro&s;e the &s;pirit, and even the humour, of the Engli&s;h ver&s;e. It is
not my wi&s;h to deny how deeply I was intere&s;ted in the&s;e Memoirs,
of which I need not &s;urely be a&s;hamed; but at the di&s;tance of more
than twenty years, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to a&s;certain the
re&s;pective &s;hares of the two a&s;&s;ociates. A long and intimate com|munication
of ideas had ca&s;t our &s;entiments and &s;tyle in the &s;ame
mould. In our &s;ocial labours we compo&s;ed and corrected by turns;
and the prai&s;e which I might hone&s;tly be&s;tow, would fall perhaps on
&s;ome article or pa&s;&s;age mo&s;t properly my own. A &s;econd volume
(for the year 1768) was publi&s;hed of the&s;e Memoirs. I will pre|&s;ume
to &s;ay, that their merit was &s;uperior to their reputation; but it
is not le&s;s true, that they were productive of more reputation than
emolument. They introduced my friend to the protection, and
my&s;elf to the acquaintance, of the Earl of Che&s;terfield, who&s;e age
and infirmities &s;ecluded him from the world; and of Mr. David
Hume, who was under-&s;ecretary to the office in which Deyverdun
was more humbly employed. The former accepted a dedication,
(April 12th, 1769,) and re&s;erved the author for the future educa|cation
of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or: the latter enriched the Journal with a reply
to Mr. Walpole's Hi&s;torical Doubts, which he afterwards &s;haped
into the form of a note. The materials of the third volume were
almo&s;t completed, when I recommended Deyverdun as governor to
Sir Richard Wor&s;ley, a youth, the &s;on of my old Lieutenant-co|lonel,
who was lately decea&s;ed. They &s;et forwards on their travels;
nor did they return to England till &s;ome time after my father's
death.</P>
<P>My next publication was an accidental &s;ally of love and re&s;ent|ment;
of my reverence for mode&s;t genius, and my aver&s;ion for in|&s;olent
pedantry. The &s;ixth book of the Aeneid is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing
and perfect compo&s;ition of Latin poetry. The de&s;cent of Aeneas
and the Sybil to the infernal regions, to the world of &s;pirits, expands
<PB N="137" REF="162">
an awful and boundle&s;s pro&s;pect, from the nocturnal gloom of the
Cumaean grot,
<Q>Ibant ob&s;curi-&s;ol&acirc; &s;ub nocte per umbram,</Q>
to the meridian brightne&s;s of the Ely&s;ian fields;
<Q><L>Largior hic campos aether et lumine ve&s;tit</L>
<L>Purpureo&mdash;</L></Q>
from the dreams of &s;imple Nature, to the dreams, alas! of Egyptian
theology, and the philo&s;ophy of the Greeks. But the final di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion
of the hero through the ivory gate, whence
<Q>Fal&s;a ad coelum mittunt in&s;omnia manes,</Q>
&s;eems to di&s;&s;olve the whole enchantment, and leaves the reader in a
&s;tate of cold and anxious &s;ceptici&s;m. This mo&s;t lame and impotent
conclu&s;ion has been variou&s;ly imputed to the ta&s;te or irreligion of
Virgil; but, according to the more elaborate interpretation of Bi&s;hop
Warburton, the de&s;cent to hell is not a fal&s;e, but a mimic &s;cene;
which repre&s;ents the initiation of Aeneas, in the character of a law-giver,
to the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries. This hypothe&s;is, a &s;ingular
chapter in the Divine Legation of Mo&s;es, had been admitted by
many as true; it was prai&s;ed by all as ingenious; nor had it
been expo&s;ed, in a &s;pace of thirty years, to a fair and critical di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion.
The learning and the abilities of the author had rai&s;ed
him to a ju&s;t eminence; but he reigned the dictator and tyrant of
the world of literature. The real merit of Warburton was degraded
by the pride and pre&s;umption with which he pronounced his infal|lible
decrees; in his polemic writings he la&s;hed his antagoni&s;ts with|out
mercy or moderation; and his &s;ervile flatterers, (&s;ee the ba&s;e and
malignant E&s;&s;ay on the <HI>Delicacy of Friend&s;hip,</HI>) exalting the ma&s;ter
critic far above Ari&s;totle and Longinus, a&s;&s;aulted every mode&s;t di&s;|&s;enter
who refu&s;ed to con&s;ult the oracle, and to adore the idol. In
a land of liberty, &s;uch de&s;poti&s;m mu&s;t provoke a general oppo&s;ition,
<PB N="138" REF="163">
and the zeal of oppo&s;ition is &s;eldom candid or impartial. A late
profe&s;&s;or of Oxford, (Dr. Lowth,) in a pointed and poli&s;hed epi&s;tle,
(Augu&s;t 31&s;t, 1765,) defended him&s;elf, and attacked the Bi&s;hop;
and, what&s;oever might be the merits of an in&s;ignificant controver&s;y,
his victory was clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;ilent confu&s;ion of War|burton
and his &s;laves. <HI>I</HI> too, without any private offence, was am|bitious
of breaking a lance again&s;t the giant's &s;hield; and in the be|ginning
of the year 1770, my Critical Ob&s;ervations on the Sixth
Book of the Aeneid were &s;ent, without my name, to the pre&s;s. In
this &s;hort E&s;&s;ay, my fir&s;t Engli&s;h publication, I aimed my &s;trokes
again&s;t the per&s;on and the hypothe&s;is of Bi&s;hop Warburton. I
proved, at lea&s;t to my own &s;atisfaction, <HI>that</HI> the antient lawgivers
did not invent the my&s;teries, and <HI>that</HI> Aeneas was never inve&s;ted
with the office of lawgiver: <HI>that</HI> there is not any argument, any
circum&s;tance, which can melt a fable into allegory, or remove the
&s;eene from the Lake Avernus to the Temple of Ceres: <HI>that</HI> &s;uch a
wild &s;uppo&s;ition is equally injurious to the poet and the man: <HI>that</HI>
if Virgil was not initiated he could not, if he were he would not,
reveal the &s;ecrets of the initiation: <HI>that</HI> the anathema of Horace
(<HI>vetabo qui Cereris &s;acrum vulgarit, &amp;c.</HI>) at once atte&s;ts his own
ignorance and the innocence of his friend. As the Bi&s;hop of
Glouce&s;ter and his party maintained a di&s;creet &s;ilence, my critical
di&s;qui&s;ition was &s;oon lo&s;t among the pamphlets of the day; but the
public coldne&s;s was overbalanced to my feelings by the weighty ap|probation
of the la&s;t and be&s;t editor of Virgil, Profe&s;&s;or Heyne of
Gottingen, who acquie&s;ces in my confutation, and &s;tiles the un|known
author, <HI>doctus&mdash;et eleganti&s;&s;imus Britannus.</HI> But I cannot
re&s;i&s;t the temptation of tran&s;cribing the favourable judgment of Mr.
Hayley, him&s;elf a poet and a &s;cholar: <Q>An intricate hypothe&s;is,

critici&s;m on Warburton, and &s;ome articles in the Journal, were my
&s;ole publications. It is more e&s;pecially incumbent on me to mark
the employment, or to confe&s;s the wa&s;te of time, from my travels
to my father's death, an interval in which I was not diverted by
any profe&s;&s;ional duties from the labours and plea&s;ures of a &s;tudious
life. 1. As &s;oon as I was relea&s;ed from the fruitle&s;s ta&s;k of the
Swi&s;s revolutions, (1768,) I began gradually to advance from the
wi&s;h to the hope, from the hope to the de&s;ign, from the de&s;ign to
the execution, of my hi&s;torical work, of who&s;e limits and extent I
had yet a very inadequate notion. The Cla&s;&s;ics, as low as Tacitus,
the younger Pliny, and Juvenal, were my old and familiar com|panions.

I in&s;en&s;ibly plunged into the ocean of the Augu&s;tan hi&s;|tory;
and in the de&s;cending &s;eries I inve&s;tigated, with my pen
almo&s;t always in my hand, the original records, both Greek and
Latin, from Dion Ca&s;&s;ius to Ammianus Marcellinus, from the reign
of Trajan to the la&s;t age of the We&s;tern Cae&s;ars. The &s;ub&s;idiary
rays of medals, and in&s;criptions of geography and chronology,
were thrown on their proper objects; and I applied the collections
of Tillemont, who&s;e inimitable accuracy almo&s;t a&s;&s;umes the cha|racter
of genius, to fix and arrange within my reach the loo&s;e and
&s;cattered atoms of hi&s;torical information. Through the darkne&s;s of
the middle ages I explored my way in the Annals and Antiquities of
Italy of the learned Muratori; and diligently compared them with
the parallel or tran&s;ver&s;e lines of Sigonius and Maffei, Baronius and
Pagi, till I almo&s;t gra&s;ped the ruins of Rome in the fourteenth cen|tury,
without &s;u&s;pecting that this final chapter mu&s;t be attained by
the labour of &s;ix quartos and twenty years. Among the books
which I purcha&s;ed, the Theodocian Code, with the commentary of
James Godefroy, mu&s;t be gratefully remembered. I u&s;ed it (and much
I u&s;ed it) as a work of hi&s;tory, rather than of juri&s;prudence: but
in every light it may be con&s;idered as a full and capacious repo&s;itory
of the political &s;tate of the empire in the fourth and fifth centuries.
As I believed, and as I &s;till believe, that the propagation of the
Go&s;pel, and the triumph of the church, are in&s;eparably connected
with the decline of the Roman monarchy, I weighed the cau&s;es
and effects of the revolution, and contra&s;ted the narratives and apo|logies
of the Chri&s;tians them&s;elves, with the glances of candour or
enmity which the Pagans have ca&s;t on the ri&s;ing &s;ects. The Jewi&s;h
and Heathen te&s;timonies, as they are collected and illu&s;trated by Dr.
Lardner, directed, without &s;uper&s;eding, my &s;earch of the originals;
and in an ample di&s;&s;ertation on the miraculous darkne&s;s of the
pa&s;&s;ion, I privately withdrew my conclu&s;ions from the &s;ilence of an
unbelieving age. I have a&s;&s;embled the preparatory &s;tudies, directly
<PB N="141" REF="166">
or indirectly relative to my hi&s;tory; but, in &s;trict equity, they mu&s;t
be &s;pread beyond this period of my life, over the two &s;ummers
(1771 and 1772) that elap&s;ed between my father's death and my
&s;ettlement in London. 2. In a free conver&s;ation with books and
men, it would be endle&s;s to enumerate the names and characters of
all who are introduced to our acquaintance; but in this general ac|quaintance
we may &s;elect the degrees of friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, ac|cording
to the wi&s;e maxim, <HI>Multum legere potius quam multa.</HI> I re|viewed,
again and again, the immortal works of the French and
Engli&s;h, the Latin and Italian cla&s;&s;ics. My Greek &s;tudies (though
le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous than I de&s;igned) maintained and extended my know|ledge
of that incomparable idiom. Homer and Xenophon were &s;till
my favourite authors; and I had almo&s;t prepared for the pre&s;s an
E&s;&s;ay on the Cyropoedia, which, in my own judgment, is not un|happily
laboured. After a certain age, the new publications of merit
are the &s;ole food of the many; and the mo&s;t au&s;tere &s;tudent will be
often tempted to break the line, for the &s;ake of indulging his own
curio&s;ity, and of providing the topics of fa&s;hionable currency. A more
re&s;pectable motive may be a&s;&s;igned for the third peru&s;al of Black&s;tone's
Commentaries, and a copious and critical ab&s;tract of that Engli&s;h
work was my fir&s;t &s;erious production in my native language.
3. My literary lei&s;ure was much le&s;s complete and independent than
it might appear to the eye of a &s;tranger. In the hurry of London I
was de&s;titute of books; in the &s;olitude of Hamp&s;hire I was not
ma&s;ter of my time. My quiet was gradually di&s;turbed by our do|me&s;tic
anxiety, and I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of my unfeeling philo&s;ophy,
had I found much time or ta&s;te for &s;tudy in the la&s;t fatal &s;ummer
(1772) of my father's decay and di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>The di&s;embodying of the militia at the clo&s;e of the war (1763)
had re&s;tored the Major (a new Cincinnatus) to a life of agriculture.
His labours were u&s;eful, his plea&s;ures innocent, his wi&s;hes mode|rate;
and my father <HI>&s;eemed</HI> to enjoy the &s;tate of happine&s;s which is
<PB N="142" REF="167">
celebrated by poets and philo&s;ophers, as the mo&s;t agreeable to nature,
and the lea&s;t acce&s;&s;ible to fortune.</P>
<Q><L>Beatus ille, qui procul negotiis</L>

<L>Like the fir&s;t mortals, ble&s;t is he,</L>

</LG></NOTE>.</L><BIBL>FRANCIS.</BIBL>

<P>But the la&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able condition, the freedom from debt, was
wanting to my father's felicity; and the vanities of his youth were
&s;everely puni&s;hed by the &s;olicitude and &s;orrow of his declining age.
The fir&s;t mortgage, on my return from Lau&s;anne, (1758,) had af|forded
him a partial and tran&s;ient relief. The annual demand of
intere&s;t and allowance was a heavy deduction from his income; the
militia was a &s;ource of expence, the farm in his hands was not a
profitable adventure, he was loaded with the co&s;ts and damages of
an ob&s;olete law-&s;uit; and each year multiplied the number, and ex|hau&s;ted
the patience, of his creditors. Under the&s;e painful circum|&s;tances,
I con&s;ented to an additional mortgage, to the &s;ale of Putney,
and to every &s;acrifice that could alleviate his di&s;tre&s;s. But he was
no longer capable of a rational effort, and his reluctant delays po&s;t|poned
not the evils them&s;elves, but the remedies of tho&s;e evils (<HI>re|media
malorum potius quam mala differebat</HI>). The pangs of &s;hame,
tenderne&s;s, and &s;elf-reproach, ince&s;&s;antly preyed on his vitals; his
con&s;titution was broken; he lo&s;t his &s;trength and his &s;ight; the ra|pid
progre&s;s of a drop&s;y admoni&s;hed him of his end, and he &s;unk
into the grave on the 10th of November 1770, in the &s;ixty-fourth
year of his age. A family-tradition in&s;inuates that Mr. William
Law had drawn his pupil in the light and incon&s;tant character of
<PB N="143" REF="168">
<HI>Flatus,</HI> who is ever confident, and ever di&s;appointed in the chace of
happine&s;s. But the&s;e con&s;titutional failings were happily compen|&s;ated
by the virtues of the head and heart, by the warme&s;t &s;enti|ments
of honour and humanity. His graceful per&s;on, polite ad|dre&s;s,
gentle manners, and unaffected cheerfulne&s;s, recommended
him to the favour of every company; and in the change of
times and opinions, his liberal &s;pirit had long &s;ince delivered him
from the zeal and prejudice of a Tory education. I &s;ubmitted to
the order of Nature; and my grief was &s;oothed by the con&s;cious
&s;atisfaction that I had di&s;charged all the duties of filial piety.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had paid the la&s;t &s;olemn duties to my father, and
obtained, from time and rea&s;on, a tolerable compo&s;ure of mind, I
began to form the plan of an independent life, mo&s;t adapted to my
circum&s;tances and inclination. Yet &s;o intricate was the net, my ef|forts
were &s;o awkward and feeble, that nearly two years (November
1770&mdash;October 1772) were &s;uffered to elap&s;e before I could di&s;en|tangle
my&s;elf from the management of the farm, and transfer my
re&s;idence from Beriton to a hou&s;e in London. During this interval
I continued to divide my year between town and the country; but
my new &s;ituation was brightened by hope; my &s;tay in London was
prolonged into the &s;ummer; and the uniformity of the &s;ummer was
occa&s;ionally broken by vi&s;its and excur&s;ions at a di&s;tance from home.
The gratification of my de&s;ires (they were not immoderate) has been
&s;eldom di&s;appointed by the want of money or credit; my pride
was never in&s;ulted by the vi&s;it of an importunate trade&s;man; and
my tran&s;ient anxiety for the pa&s;t or future has been di&s;pelled by the
&s;tudious or &s;ocial occupation of the pre&s;ent hour. My con&s;cience
does not accu&s;e me of any act of extravagance or inju&s;tice, and the
remnant of my e&s;tate affords an ample and honourable provi&s;ion for
my declining age. I &s;hall not expatiate on my oeconomical affairs,
which cannot be in&s;tructive or amu&s;ing to the reader. It is a rule
of prudence, as well as of politene&s;s, to re&s;erve &s;uch confidence for
<PB N="144" REF="169">
the ear of a private friend, without expo&s;ing our &s;ituation to the
envy or pity of &s;trangers; for envy is productive of hatred, and
pity borders too nearly on contempt. Yet I may believe, and even
a&s;&s;ert, that in circum&s;tances more indigent or more wealthy, I &s;hould
never have accompli&s;hed the ta&s;k, or acquired the fame, of an hi&s;|torian;
that my &s;pirit would have been broken by poverty and con|tempt,
and that my indu&s;try might have been relaxed in the labour
and luxury of a &s;uperfluous fortune.</P>
<P>I had now attained the fir&s;t of earthly ble&s;&s;ings, independence: I
was the ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of my hours and actions: nor was I deceived
in the hope that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of my library in town would allow
me to divide the day between &s;tudy and &s;ociety. Each year the circle
of my acquaintance, the number of my dead and living companions,
was enlarged. To a lover of books, the &s;hops and &s;ales of London
pre&s;ent irre&s;i&s;tible temptations; and the manufacture of my hi&s;tory
required a various and growing &s;tock of materials. The militia, my
travels, the Hou&s;e of Commons, the fame of an author, contributed
to multiply my connections: I was cho&s;en a member of the fa&s;hion|able
clubs; and, before I left England in 1783, there were few per|&s;ons
of any eminence in the literary or political world to whom I
was a &s;tranger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the mixed, though polite, company of Boodle's, White's, and Brooks's, I mu&s;t honourably di&s;tingui&s;h a weekly &s;ociety, which was in&s;tituted in the year 1764, and which &s;till continues to flouri&s;h, under the title of the Literary Club. (Hawkins's Life of John&s;on, p. 415. Bo&s;well's Tour to the Hebrides, p. 97.) The names of Dr. John&s;on, Mr. Burke, Mr. Topham Beauclerc, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Gold&s;mith, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Colman, Sir William Jones, Dr. Percy, Mr. Fox, Mr. She|ridan, Mr. Adam Smith, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Dunning, Sir Jo&s;eph Banks, Dr. Warton, and his brother Mr. Thomas Warton, Dr. Burney, &amp;c. form a large and luminous con&s;tellation of Briti&s;h &s;tars.</NOTE>. It would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be in my power to amu&s;e
the reader with a gallery of portraits and a collection of anecdotes.
But I have always condemned the practice of transforming a private
memorial into a vehicle of &s;atire or prai&s;e. By my own choice I
pa&s;&s;ed in town the greate&s;t part of the year; but whenever I was
<PB N="145" REF="170">
de&s;irous of breathing the air of the country, I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ho&s;pitable
retreat at Sheffield-place in Su&s;&s;ex, in the family of my valuable
friend Mr. Holroyd, who&s;e character, under the name of Lord
Sheffield, has &s;ince been more con&s;picuous to the public.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was I &s;ettled in my hou&s;e and library, than I under|took
the compo&s;ition of the fir&s;t volume of my Hi&s;tory. At the
out&s;et all was dark and doubtful; even the title of the work, the
true aera of the Decline and Fall of the Empire, the limits of the
introduction, the divi&s;ion of the chapters, and the order of the nar|rative;
and I was often tempted to ca&s;t away the labour of &s;even
years. The &s;tyle of an author &s;hould be the image of his mind, but
the choice and command of language is the fruit of exerci&s;e. Many
experiments were made before I could hit the middle tone between
a dull chronicle and a rhetorical declamation: three times did I com|po&s;e
the fir&s;t chapter, and twice the &s;econd and third, before I was
tolerably &s;atisfied with their effect. In the remainder of the way I
advanced with a more equal and ea&s;y pace; but the fifteenth and
&s;ixteenth chapters have been reduced by three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive revi&s;als, from
a large volume to their pre&s;ent &s;ize; and they might &s;till be com|pre&s;&s;ed,
without any lo&s;s of facts or &s;entiments. An oppo&s;ite fault
may be imputed to the conci&s;e and &s;uperficial narrative of the fir&s;t
reigns from Commodus to Alexander; a fault of which I have never
heard, except from Mr. Hume in his la&s;t journey to London. Such
an oracle might have been con&s;ulted and obeyed with rational de|votion;
but I was &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted with the mode&s;t practice of read|ing
the manu&s;cript to my friends. Of &s;uch friends &s;ome will
prai&s;e from politene&s;s, and &s;ome will critici&s;e from vanity. The
author him&s;elf is the be&s;t judge of his own performance; no one has
&s;o deeply meditated on the &s;ubject; no one is &s;o &s;incerely intere&s;ted
in the event.</P>
<P>By the friend&s;hip of Mr. (now Lord) Eliot, who had married my
fir&s;t cou&s;in, I was returned at the general election. for the borough
<PB N="146" REF="171">
of Le&s;keard. I took my &s;eat at the beginning of the memorable
conte&s;t between Great Britain and America, and &s;upported, with
many a &s;incere and &s;ilent vote, the rights, though not, perhaps, the
intere&s;t, of the mother country. After a fleeting illu&s;ive hope, pru|dence
condemned me to acquie&s;ce in the humble &s;tation of a mute.
I was not armed by Nature and education with the intrepid energy
of mind and voice.</P>
<Q>Vincentem &s;trepitus, et natum rebus agendis.</Q>
<P>Timidity was fortified by pride, and even the &s;ucce&s;s of my pen di&s;|couraged
the trial of my voice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A French &s;ketch of Mr. Gibbon's Life, written by him&s;elf, probably for the u&s;e of &s;ome foreign journali&s;t or tran&s;lator, contains no fact not mentioned in his Engli&s;h Life.

But I a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the debates of a
free a&s;&s;embly; I li&s;tened to the attack and defence of eloquence and
rea&s;on; I had a near pro&s;pect of the characters, views, and pa&s;&s;ions
of the fir&s;t men of the age. The cau&s;e of government was ably
vindicated by <HI>Lord North,</HI> a &s;tate&s;man of &s;potle&s;s integrity, a con|&s;ummate
ma&s;ter of debate, who could wield, with equal dexterity,
the arms of rea&s;on and of ridicule. He was &s;eated on the Trea&s;ury-bench
between his Attorney and Solicitor General, the two pillars
of the law and &s;tate, <HI>magis pares quam &s;imiles;</HI> and the mini&s;ter might
indulge in a &s;hort &s;lumber, whil&s;t he was upholden on either hand
by the maje&s;tic &s;en&s;e of <HI>Thurlow,</HI> and the &s;kilful eloquence of <HI>Wedder|burne.</HI>
From the adver&s;e &s;ide of the hou&s;e an ardent and powerful
oppo&s;ition was &s;upported, by the lively declamation of <HI>Barr&eacute;,</HI> the
legal acutene&s;s of <HI>Dunning,</HI> the profu&s;e and philo&s;ophic fancy of
<HI>Burke,</HI> and the argumentative vehemence of <HI>Fox,</HI> who in the con|duct
of a party approved him&s;elf equal to the conduct of an empire.
<PB N="147" REF="172">
By &s;uch men every operation of peace and war, every principle
of ju&s;tice or policy, every que&s;tion of authority and freedom, was
attacked and defended; and the &s;ubject of the momentous conte&s;t
was the union or &s;eparation of Great Britain and America. The
eight &s;e&s;&s;ions that I &s;at in parliament were a &s;chool of civil pru|dence,
the fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential virtue of an hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>The volume of my Hi&s;tory, which had been &s;omewhat delayed
by the novelty and tumult of a fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, was now ready for
the pre&s;s. After the perilous adventure had been declined by my
friend Mr. Elm&s;ly, I agreed, upon ea&s;y terms, with Mr. Thomas
Cadell, a re&s;pectable book&s;eller, and Mr. William Strahan, an emi|nent
printer; and they undertook the care and ri&s;k of the publica|tion,
which derived more credit from the name of the &s;hop than
from that of the author. The la&s;t revi&s;al of the proofs was &s;ub|mitted
to my vigilance; and many blemi&s;hes of &s;tyle, which had
been invi&s;ible in the manu&s;cript, were di&s;covered and corrected in
the printed &s;heet. So moderate were our hopes, that the original
impre&s;&s;ion had been &s;tinted to five hundred, till the number was
doubled by the prophetic ta&s;te of Mr. Strahan. During this awful
interval I was neither elated by the ambition of fame, nor depre&s;&s;ed
by the apprehen&s;ion of contempt. My diligence and accuracy were
atte&s;ted by my own con&s;cience. Hi&s;tory is the mo&s;t popular &s;pecies
of writing, &s;ince it can adapt it&s;elf to the highe&s;t or the lowe&s;t ca|pacity.
I had cho&s;en an illu&s;trious &s;ubject. Rome is familiar to
the &s;chool-boy and the &s;tate&s;man; and my narrative was deduced
from the la&s;t period of cla&s;&s;ical reading. I had likewi&s;e flattered
my&s;elf, that an age of light and liberty would receive, without &s;can|dal,
an inquiry into the human <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of the progre&s;s and e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s how to de&s;cribe the &s;ucce&s;s of the work, without
betraying the vanity of the writer. The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion was ex|bau&s;ted
in a few days; a &s;econd and third edition were &s;carcely
<PB N="148" REF="173">
adequate to the demand; and the book&s;eller's property was twice
invaded by the pirates of Dublin. My book was on every table,
and almo&s;t on every toilette; the hi&s;torian was crowned by the ta&s;te
or fa&s;hion of the day; nor was the general voice di&s;turbed by the
barking of any <HI>profane</HI> critic. The favour of mankind is mo&s;t freely
be&s;towed on a new acquaintance of any original merit; and the
mutual &s;urprize of the public and their favourite is productive of
tho&s;e warm &s;en&s;ibilities, which at a &s;econd meeting can no longer be
rekindled. If I li&s;tened to the mu&s;ic of prai&s;e, I was more &s;eriou&s;ly
&s;atisfied with the approbation of my judges. The candour of Dr.
Robert&s;on embraced his di&s;ciple. A letter from Mr. Hume overpaid
the labour of ten years; but I have never pre&s;umed to accept a
place in the triumvirate of Briti&s;h hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>That curious and original letter will amu&s;e the reader, and his
gratitude &s;hould &s;hield my free communication from the reproach of
vanity.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>EDINBURGH, <DATE>18th March 1776.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As I ran through your volume of hi&s;tory with great avidity and
impatience, I cannot forbear di&s;covering &s;omewhat of the &s;ame impa|tience
in returning you thanks for your agreeable pre&s;ent, and expre&s;&s;|ing
the &s;atisfaction which the performance has given me. Whether
I con&s;ider the dignity of your &s;tyle, the depth of your matter, or the
exten&s;ivene&s;s of your learning, I mu&s;t regard the work as equally
the object of e&s;teem; and I own that if I had not previou&s;ly had
the happine&s;s of your per&s;onal acquaintance, &s;uch a performance
from an Engli&s;hman in our age would have given me &s;ome &s;urprize.
You may &s;mile at this &s;entiment; but as it &s;eems to me that your
countrymen, for almo&s;t a whole generation, have given them&s;elves
up to barbarous and ab&s;urd faction, and have totally neglected all
polite letters, I no longer expected any valuable production ever to
come from them. I know it will give you plea&s;ure (as it did me)
<PB N="149" REF="174">
to find that all the men of letters in this place concur in their ad|miration
of your work, and in their anxious de&s;ire of your con|tinuing
it.</P>
<P>When I heard of your undertaking, (which was &s;ome time ago,)
I own I was a little curious to &s;ee how you would extricate your&s;elf
from the &s;ubject of your two la&s;t chapters. I think you have ob|&s;erved
a very prudent temperament; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to treat
the &s;ubject &s;o as not to give grounds of &s;u&s;picion again&s;t you, and
you may expect that a clamour will ari&s;e. This, if any thing, will
retard your &s;ucce&s;s with the public; for in every other re&s;pect your
work is calculated to be popular. But among many other marks of
decline, the prevalence of &s;uper&s;tition in England progno&s;ticates the
fall of philo&s;ophy and decay of ta&s;te; and though nobody be more
capable than you to revive them, you will probably find a &s;truggle
in your fir&s;t advances.</P>
<P>I &s;ee you entertain a great doubt with regard to the authenticity
of the poems of O&s;&s;ian. You are certainly right in &s;o doing. It is
indeed &s;trange that any men of &s;en&s;e could have imagined it po&s;&s;ible,
that above twenty thou&s;and ver&s;es, along with numberle&s;s hi&s;torical
facts, could have been pre&s;erved by oral tradition during fifty gene|rations,
by the rude&s;t, perhaps, of all the European nations, the
mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous, the mo&s;t turbulent, and the mo&s;t un&s;ettled. Where
a &s;uppo&s;ition is &s;o contrary to common &s;en&s;e, any po&s;itive evidence
of it ought never to be regarded: Men run with great avidity to
give their evidence in favour of what flatters their pa&s;&s;ions and their
national prejudices. You are therefore over and above indulgent to
us in &s;peaking of the matter with he&s;itation.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t inform you that we are all very anxious to hear that you
have fully collected the materials for your &s;econd volume, and that
you are even con&s;iderably advanced in the compo&s;ition of it. I &s;peak
this more in the name of my friends than in my own; as I cannot
<PB N="150" REF="175">
expect to live &s;o long as to &s;ee the publication of it. Your en&s;uing
volume will be more delicate than the preceding, but I tru&s;t in your
prudence for extricating you from the difficulties; and, in all
events, you have courage to de&s;pi&s;e the clamour of bigots.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, with great regard,
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient, and mo&s;t humble Servant,
DAVID HUME.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>Some weeks afterwards I had the melancholy plea&s;ure of &s;eeing
Mr. Hume in his pa&s;&s;age through London; his body feeble, his
mind firm. On the 25th of Augu&s;t of the &s;ame year (1776) he
died, at Edinburgh, the death of a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>My &s;econd excur&s;ion to Paris was determined by the pre&s;&s;ing in|vitation
of M. and Madame Necker, who had vi&s;ited England in
the preceding &s;ummer. On my arrival I found M. Necker Director-general
of the finances, in the fir&s;t bloom of power and popularity.
His private fortune enabled him to &s;upport a liberal e&s;tabli&s;hment;
and his wife, who&s;e talents and virtues I had long admired, was ad|mirably
qualified to pre&s;ide in the conver&s;ation of her table and
drawing-room. As their friend, I was introduced to the be&s;t com|pany
of both &s;exes; to the foreign mini&s;ters of all nations, and to
the fir&s;t names and characters of France; who di&s;tingui&s;hed me by
&s;uch marks of civility and kindne&s;s, as gratitude will not &s;uffer me
to forget, and mode&s;ty will not allow me to enumerate. The
fa&s;hionable &s;uppers often broke into the morning hours; yet I occa|&s;ionally
con&s;ulted the Royal Library, and that of the Abbey of
St. Germain, and in the free u&s;e of their books at home, I had
always rea&s;on to prai&s;e the liberality of tho&s;e in&s;titutions. The &s;o|ciety
of men of letters I neither courted nor declined; but I was
<PB N="151" REF="176">
happy in the acquaintance of M. de Buffon, who united with a &s;u|blime
genius the mo&s;t amiable &s;implicity of mind and manners.
At the table of my old friend, M. de Foncemagne, I was involved
in a di&s;pute with the Abb&eacute; de Mably; and his jealous ira&s;cible &s;pirit
revenged it&s;elf on a work which he was incapable of reading in the
original.</P>
<P>As I might be partial in my own cau&s;e, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the words
of an unknown critic, ob&s;erving only, that this di&s;pute had been
preceded by another on the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, at the hou&s;e of the
Counte&s;s de Froulay, an old Jan&s;eni&s;t lady.</P>
<P><Q>Vous &eacute;tiez chez M. de Foncemagne, mon cher Theodon, le jour
que M. l'Abb&eacute; de Mably et M. Gibbon y dinerent en grande com|pagnie.
La conver&s;ation roula pre&s;que enti&egrave;rement &s;ur l'hi&s;toire.
L'Abb&eacute; etant un profond politique, la tourna &s;ur l'admini&s;tration,
quand on fut au de&s;ert: et comme par caract&egrave;re, par humeur,
par l'habitude d'admirer Tite Live, il ne pri&s;e que le &s;y&s;t&ecirc;me re|publicain,
il &s;e mit &agrave; vanter l'excellence des republiques; bien
per&s;uad&eacute; que le &s;avant Anglois l'approuveroit en tout, et admireroit
la profondeur de g&eacute;nie qui avoit fait deviner tous ces avantages &agrave;
un Fran&ccedil;ois. Mais M. Gibbon, in&s;truit par l'experience des in|conveniens
d'un gouvernement populaire, ne fut point du tout de
&s;on avis, et il prit g&eacute;n&eacute;reu&s;ement la d&eacute;fen&s;e du gouvernement mo|narchique.
L'Abb&eacute; voulut le convaincre par Tite Live, et par
quelques argumens tir&eacute;s de Plutarque en faveur des Spartiates.
M. Gibbon, dou&eacute; de la memoire la plus heureu&s;e, et ayant tous l&egrave;s
faits pre&s;ens &agrave; la pen&s;&eacute;e, domina bien-tot la conver&s;ation; l'Abb&eacute; &s;e
facha, il s'emporta, il dit des cho&s;es dures; l'Anglois, con&s;ervant le
phlegme de &s;on pays, prenoit &s;es avantages, et pre&s;&s;oit l'Abb&eacute; avee
d'autant plus de &s;ucc&egrave;s que la colere le troubloit de plus en plus.
La conver&s;ation s'echauffoit, et M. de Foncemagne la rompit en &s;e
levant de table, et en pa&s;&s;ant dans le &s;alon, o&ugrave; per&s;onne ne fut tent&eacute;

<P>Nearly two years had elap&s;ed between the publication of my fir&s;t
and the commenc&eacute;ment of my &s;econd volume; and the cau&s;es mu&s;t
be a&s;&s;igned of this long delay. 1. After a &s;hort holiday, I indulged
my curio&s;ity in &s;ome &s;tudies of a very different nature, a cour&s;e of
anatomy, which was demon&s;trated by Doctor Hunter; and &s;ome
le&s;&s;ons of chymi&s;try, which were delivered by Mr. Higgins. The
principles of the&s;e &s;ciences, and ta&s;te for books of natural hi&s;tory,
contributed to multiply my ideas and images; and the anatomi&s;t and
chymi&s;t may &s;ometimes track me in their own &s;now. 2. I dived,
perhaps too deeply, into the mud of the Arian controver&s;y; and
many days of reading, thinking, and writing were con&s;umed in the
pur&s;uit of a phantom. 3. It is difficult to arrange, with order and
per&s;picuity, the various tran&s;actions of the age of Con&s;tantine; and
&s;o much was I di&s;plea&s;ed with the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, that I committed to the
flames above fifty &s;heets. 4. The &s;ix months of Paris and plea&s;ure
mu&s;t be deducted from the account. But when I re&s;umed my ta&s;k
I felt my improvement; I was now ma&s;ter of my &s;tyle and &s;ubject,
and while the mea&s;ure of my daily performance was enlarged, I di&s;|covered
<PB N="153" REF="178">
le&s;s rea&s;on to cancel or correct. It has always been my
practice to ca&s;t a long paragraph in a &s;ingle mould, to try it by my
ear, to depo&s;it it in my memory, but to &s;u&s;pend the action of the
pen till I had given the la&s;t poli&s;h to my work. Shall I add, that I
never found my mind more vigorous, nor my compo&s;ition more
happy, than in the winter hurry of &s;ociety and parliament?</P>
<P>Had I believed that the majority of Engli&s;h readers were &s;o fondly
attached even to the name and &s;hadow of Chri&s;tianity; had I fore&s;cen
that the pious, the timid, and the prudent, would feel, or affect to
feel, with &s;uch exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility; I might, perhaps, have &s;o&s;tened
the two invidious chapters, which would create many enemies, and
conciliate few friends. But the &s;haft was &s;hot, the alarm was &s;ounded,
and I could only rejoice, that if the voice of our prie&s;ts was clamo|rous
and bitter, their hands were di&s;armed from the powers of per|&s;ecution.
I adhered to the wi&s;e re&s;olution of tru&s;ting my&s;elf and
my writings to the candour of the public, till Mr. Davies of Oxford
pre&s;umed to attack, not the faith, but the fidelity, of the hi&s;torian.
<HI>My Vindication,</HI> expre&s;&s;ive of le&s;s anger than contempt, amu&s;ed for
a moment the bu&s;y and idle metropolis; and the mo&s;t rational part
of the laity, and even of the clergy, appear to have been &s;atisfied
of my innocence and accuracy. I would not print this Vindication in
quarto, le&s;t it &s;hould be bound and pre&s;erved with the hi&s;tory it&s;elf. At
the di&s;tance of twelve years, I calmly affirm my judgment of Davies,
Chel&s;um, &amp;c. A victory over &s;uch antagoni&s;ts was a &s;ufficient hu|miliation.
They, however, were rewarded in this world. Poor
Chel&s;um was indeed neglected; and I dare not boa&s;t the making
Dr. Wat&s;on a bi&s;hop; he is a prelate of a large mind and liberal
&s;pirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letters, N^o LXVIII. LXIX. and C.</NOTE>: but I enjoyed the plea&s;ure of giving a Royal pen&s;ion to
Mr. Davies, and of collating Dr. Apthorpe to an archiepi&s;copal living.

remember, and tedious to rehear&s;e. The li&s;t of my adver&s;aries, how|ever,
was graced with the more re&s;pectable names of Dr. Prie&s;tley,
Sir David Dalrymple, and Dr. White; and every polemic, of either
univer&s;ity, di&s;charged his &s;ermon or pamphlet again&s;t the impe|netrable
&s;ilence of the Roman hi&s;torian. In his Hi&s;tory of the
Corruptions of Chri&s;tianity, Dr. Prie&s;tley threw down his two gaunt|lets
to Bi&s;hop Hurd and Mr. Gibbon. I declined the challenge in a
letter, exhorting my opponent to enlighten the world by his philo|&s;ophical
di&s;coveries, and to remember that the merit of his prede|ce&s;&s;or
Servetus is now reduced to a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age, which indicates the
&s;maller circulation of the blood through the lungs, from and to the
heart<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A&s;truc de la Structure du Coeur, tom. i. 77. 79. Appendix, Letters CXIX-CXXIV.</NOTE> In&s;tead of li&s;tening to this friendly advice, the dauntle&s;s
philo&s;opher of Birmingham continued to &s;ire away his double bat|tery
again&s;t tho&s;e who believed too little, and tho&s;e who believed too
much. <HI>From my</HI> replies he has nothing to hope or fear: but his
Socinian &s;hield has repeatedly been pierced by the &s;pear of Hor&s;ley,
and his trumpet of &s;edition may at length awaken the magi&s;trates of
a free country.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ion and rank of Sir David Dalrymple (now a Lord of
Se&s;&s;ion) has given a more decent colour to his &s;tyle. But he &s;cru|tinized
<PB N="155" REF="180">
each &s;eparate pa&s;&s;age of the two chapters with the dry mi|nutene&s;s
of a &s;pecial pleader; and as he was always &s;olicitous to
make, he may have &s;ucceeded &s;ometimes in finding, a flaw. In his
Annals of Scotland, he has &s;hewn him&s;elf a diligent collector and an
accurate critic.</P>
<P>I have prai&s;ed, and I &s;till prai&s;e, the eloquent &s;ermons which were
preached in St. Mary's pulpit at Oxford by Dr. White. If he a&s;|&s;aulted
me with &s;ome degree of illiberal acrimony, in &s;uch a place,
and before &s;uch an audience, he was obliged to &s;peak the language
of the country. I &s;miled at a pa&s;&s;age in one of his private letters to
Mr. Badcock; <Q>The part where we encounter Gibbon mu&s;t be
brilliant and &s;triking.</Q></P>
<P>In a &s;ermon preached before the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, Dr. Ed|wards
complimented a work, <Q>which can only peri&s;h with the
language it&s;elf;</Q> and e&s;teems the author a formidable enemy. He
is, indeed, a&s;toni&s;hed that more learning and ingenuity has not been
&s;hewn in the defence of I&s;rael; that the prelates and dignitaries of
the church (alas, good man!) did not vie with each other, who&s;e
&s;tone &s;hould &s;ink the deepe&s;t in the forehead of this Goliah.</P>
<P><Q>But the force of truth will oblige us to confe&s;s, that in the at|tacks
which have been levelled again&s;t our &s;ceptical hi&s;torian, we
can di&s;cover but &s;lender traces of profound and exqui&s;ite erudition,
of &s;olid critici&s;m and accurate inve&s;tigation; but we are too fre|quently
di&s;gu&s;ted by vague and inconclu&s;ive rea&s;oning; by un&s;ea|&s;onable
banter and &s;en&s;ele&s;s wittici&s;ms; by imbittered bigotry and
enthu&s;ia&s;tic jargon; by futile cavils and illiberal invectives. Proud
and elated by the weakne&s;s of his antagoni&s;ts, he conde&s;cends not
to handle the &s;word of controver&s;y<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monthly Review, Oct. 1790.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Let me frankly own that I was &s;tartled at the fir&s;t di&s;charge of
eccle&s;ia&s;tical ordnance; but as &s;oon as I found that this empty noi&s;e
was mi&s;chievous only in the intention, my fear was converted into
<PB N="156" REF="181">
indignation; and every feeling of indignation or curio&s;ity has long
&s;ince &s;ub&s;ided in pure and placid indifference.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecution of my hi&s;tory was &s;oon afterwards checked by
another controver&s;y of a very different kind. At the reque&s;t of the
Lord Chancellor, and of Lord Weymouth, then Secretary of State,
I vindicated, again&s;t the French manife&s;to, the ju&s;tice of the Briti&s;h
arms. The whole corre&s;pondence of Lord Stormont, our late am|ba&s;&s;ador
at Paris, was &s;ubmitted to my in&s;pection, and the <HI>Memoire
Ju&s;tificatif,</HI> which I compo&s;ed in French, was fir&s;t approved by the
Cabinet Mini&s;ters, and then delivered as a &s;tate paper to the courts
of Europe. The &s;tyle and manner are prai&s;ed by Beaumarchais
him&s;elf, who, in his private quarrel, attempted a reply; but he
flatters me, by a&s;cribing the memoir to Lord Stormont; and the
gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of his invective betrays the lo&s;s of temper and of wit; he
acknowledged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oeuvres de Beaumarchais, tom. iii. p. 299. 355.</NOTE>, that <HI>le &s;tyle ne &s;eroit pas &s;ans grace, ni la logique
&s;ans ju&s;te&s;&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. if the facts were true which he undertakes to di&s;|prove.
For the&s;e facts my credit is not pledged; I &s;poke as a
lawyer from my brief, but the veracity of Beaumarchais may be
e&s;timated from the a&s;&s;ertion that France, by the treaty of Paris
(1763), was limited to a certain number of &s;hips of war. On the
application of the Duke of Choi&s;eul, he was obliged to retract this
daring fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>Among the honourable connections which I had formed, I may
ju&s;tly be proud of the friend&s;hip of Mr. Wedderburne, at that time
Attorney General, who now illu&s;trates the title of Lord Lough|borough,
and the office of Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas. By
his &s;trong recommendation, and the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of Lord
North, I was appointed one of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade
and Plantations; and my private income was enlarged by a clear
addition of between &s;even and eight hundred pounds a-year. The
fancy of an ho&s;tile orator may paint, in the &s;trong colours of ridi|cule,
<PB N="157" REF="182">
<Q>the perpetual virtual adjournment, and the unbroken &s;itting

(See Mr. Burke's &s;peech on the Bill of Reform, p. 72-80.)

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Ye&s;terday I received a very intere&s;ting communication from my friend, who&s;e kind and honourable behaviour towards me I mu&s;t always remember with the highe&s;t gratitude. He informed me that, in con&s;equence of an arrangement, a place at the Board of Trade was re&s;erved for me, and that as &s;oon as I &s;ignified my acceptance of it, he was &s;atisfied no farther difficulties would ari&s;e. My an&s;wer to him was &s;incere and explicit. I told him that I was far from approving all the pa&s;t mea&s;ures of the ad|mini&s;tration, even &s;ome of tho&s;e in which I my&s;elf had &s;ilently concurred; that I &s;aw, with the re&s;t of the world, many capital defects in the characters of &s;ome of the pre|&s;ent mini&s;ters, and was &s;orry that in &s;o alarming a &s;ituation of public affairs, the country had not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal able and hone&s;t men who are now in oppo|&s;ition. But that I had not formed with any of tho&s;e per&s;ons in oppo&s;ition any engage|ments or connections which could in the lea&s;t re&s;train or affect my parliamentary con|duct; that I could not di&s;cover among them &s;uch &s;uperior advantages, either of mea|&s;ures or of abilities, as could make me con&s;ider it as a duty to attach my&s;elf to their cau&s;e; and that I clearly under&s;tood, from the public and private language of&mdash;, one of their leaders, that in the actual &s;tate of the country, he him&s;elf was &s;eriou&s;ly of opinion that oppo&s;ition could not tend to any good purpo&s;e, and might be productive of much mi&s;chief; that, for tho&s;e rea&s;ons, I &s;aw no objections which could prevent me from accepting an office under the pre&s;ent government, and that I was ready to take a &s;tep which I found to be con&s;i&s;tent both with my intere&s;t and my honour.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t now be decided, whether I may continue to live in England, or whether I mu&s;t &s;oon withdraw my&s;elf into a kind of philo&s;ophical exile in Switzerland. My father left his affairs in a &s;tate of embarra&s;&s;ment, and even of di&s;tre&s;s. My attempts to di&s;po&s;e of a part of my landed property have hitherto been di&s;appointed, and are not likely at pre&s;ent to be more &s;ucce&s;sful: and my plan of expence, though moderate in it&s;elf, de&s;erves the name of extravagance, &s;ince it exceeds my real income. The ad|dition of the &s;alary which is now offered will make my &s;ituation perfectly ea&s;y; but I hope you will do me the ju&s;tice to believe that my mind could not be &s;o, unle&s;s I were &s;atisfied of the rectitude of my own conduct.</P>

The a&s;pect of the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was &s;tormy and pe|rilous;
county meetings, petitions, and committees of corre&s;pond|ence,
announced the public di&s;content; and in&s;tead of voting with
a triumphant majority, the friends of government were often ex|po&s;ed
to a &s;truggle, and &s;ometimes to a defeat. The Hou&s;e of Com|mons
adopted Mr. Dunning's motion, <Q>That the influence of the
Crown had increa&s;ed, was increa&s;ing, and ought to be dimi|ni&s;hed:</Q>
and Mr. Burke's bill of reform was framed with &s;kill,
introduced with eloquence, and &s;upported by numbers. Our late
pre&s;ident, the American Secretary of State, very narrowly e&s;caped
the &s;entence of pro&s;cription; but the unfortunate Board of Trade
was aboli&s;hed in the committee by a &s;mall majority (207 to 199)
of eight votes. The &s;torm, however, blew over for a time; a large
defection of country gentlemen eluded the &s;anguine hopes of the
patriots: the Lords of Trade were revived; admini&s;tration reco|vered
their &s;trength and &s;pirit; and the flames of London, which
were kindled by a mi&s;chievous madman, admoni&s;hed all thinking
men of the danger of an appeal to the people. In the premature
di&s;&s;olution which followed this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament I lo&s;t my &s;eat.
Mr. Elliot was now deeply engaged in the mea&s;ures of oppo&s;ition,
and the electors of Le&s;keard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The borough which Mr. Gibbon had repre&s;ented in parliament.</NOTE> are commonly of the &s;ame opinion
as Mr. Elliot.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="184">
In this interval of my &s;enatorial life, I publi&s;hed the &s;econd and
third volumes of the Decline and Fall. My eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory &s;till
breathed the &s;ame &s;pirit of freedom; but prote&s;tant zeal is more
indifferent to the characters and controver&s;ies of the fourth and fifth
centuries. My ob&s;tinate &s;ilence had damped the ardour of the po|lemics.
Dr. Wat&s;on, the mo&s;t candid of my adver&s;aries, a&s;&s;ured me
that he had no thoughts of renewing the attack, and my impartial
balance of the virtues and vices of Julian was generally prai&s;ed.
This truce was interrupted only by &s;ome animadver&s;ions of the Ca|tholics
of Italy, and by &s;ome angry letters from Mr. Travis, who
made me per&s;onally re&s;pon&s;ible for condemning, with the be&s;t cri|tics,
the &s;purious text of the three heavenly witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The piety or prudence of my Italian tran&s;lator has provided an
antidote again&s;t the poi&s;on of his original. The 5th and 7th vo|lumes
are armed with five letters from an anonymous divine to his
friends, Foothead and Kirk, two Engli&s;h &s;tudents at Rome; and this
meritorious &s;ervice is commended by Mon&s;ignor Stonor, a prelate of
the &s;ame nation, who di&s;covers much venom in the <HI>fluid</HI> and nervous
&s;tyle of Gibbon. The critical e&s;&s;ay at the end of the third volume
was furni&s;hed by the Abbate Nicola Spedalieri, who&s;e zeal has gra|dually
&s;welled to a more &s;olid confutation in two quarto volumes.&mdash;
Shall I be excu&s;ed for not having read them?</P>
<P>The brutal in&s;olence of Mr. Travis's challenge can only be excu&s;ed
by the ab&s;ence of learning, judgment, and humanity; and to that ex|cu&s;e
he has the faire&s;t or foule&s;t preten&s;ion. Compared with Arch|deacon
Travis, Chel&s;um and Davies a&s;&s;ume the title of re&s;pectable
enemies.</P>

are founded in argument, enriched with learning, and enlivened
with wit; and his adver&s;ary neither de&s;erves nor finds any quarter at
his hands. The evidence of the three heavenly witne&s;&s;es would now
be rejected in any court of ju&s;tice: but prejudice is blind, authority
is deaf, and our vulgar bibles will ever be polluted by this &s;purious

Bi&s;hop Newton, in writing his own life, was at full liberty to declare
how much he him&s;elf and two eminent brethren were di&s;gu&s;ted by
Mr. G.'s prolixity, tediou&s;ne&s;s, and affectation. But the old man
&s;hould not have indulged his zeal in a fal&s;e and feeble charge again&s;t

<P>Thomas Newton, Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol and Dean of St. Paul's, was born at Litchfield on the 21&s;t of December 1703, O. S. (1 &s;t January 1704, N. S.), and died the 14th of February 1782, in the 79th year of his age. A few days before his death he fini&s;hed the memoirs of his own life, which have been prefixed to an edition of his po&s;thu|mous works, fir&s;t publi&s;hed in quarto, and &s;ince (1787) re-publi&s;hed in &s;ix volume octavo.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 173, 174. Some books were publi&s;hed in 1781, which employed &s;ome of the Bi&s;hop's lei&s;ure hours, and during his illne&s;s. Mr. Gibbon's <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Decline and Fall of the Roman &Eacute;mpire</HI> he read throughout, but it by no means an&s;wered his expecta|tion; for he found it rather a prolix and tedious performance, his matter unintere&s;ting, and his &s;tyle affected; his te&s;timonies not to be depended upon, and his frequent &s;coffs at religion offen&s;ive to every &s;ober mind. He had before been convicted of making fal&s;e quotations, which &s;hould have taught him more prudence and caution. But, without examining his authorities, there is one which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;trike every man who has read Dr. Burnet's Treati&s;e <HI>de Stat&uacute; Mortuorum.</HI> In vol. iii. p. 99. Mr. G. has the following note:&mdash;<Q>Burnet (<HI>de S. M.</HI> p. 56&mdash;84.) collects the opinions of the Fathers, as far as they a&s;&s;ert the &s;leep or repo&s;e of human &s;ouls till the day of judg|ment. He afterwards expo&s;es (p. 91.) the inconveniences which mu&s;t ari&s;e if they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a more active and &s;en&s;ible exi&s;tence. Who would not from hence infer that Dr. B. was an advocate for the &s;leep or in&s;en&s;ible exi&s;tence of the &s;oul after death? whereas his doctrine is directly the contrary. He has employed &s;ome chap|ters in treating of the &s;tate of human &s;ouls in the interval between death and the re&s;urrection; and after various proofs from rea&s;on, from &s;cripture, and the Fathers, his conclu&s;ions are, that human &s;ouls exi&s;t after their &s;eparation from the body, that they are in a good or evil &s;tate according to their good or ill behaviour, but that neither their happine&s;s nor their mi&s;ery will be complete or perfect before the day of judgment. His argumentation is thus &s;ummed up at the end of the 4th chapter&mdash;<HI>Ex quibus con&s;tat primo, animas &s;upere&s;&s;e extincto corpore; &s;ecundo, bonas bene, malas male &s;e habituras; tertio, nec illis &s;ummam felicitatem, nec his &s;ummam mi&s;eriam, acce&s;&s;uram e&s;&s;e ante diem judicii.</HI></Q> (The Bi&s;hop's reading the whole was a greater compliment to the work than was paid to it by two of the mo&s;t eminent of his brethren for their learn|ing and &s;tation. The one entered upon it, but was &s;oon wearied, and laid it a&s;ide in di&s;gu&s;t: the other returned it upon the book&s;eller's hands; and it is &s;aid that Mr. G. him&s;elf happened unluckily to be in the &s;hop at the &s;ame time.)</P>
<P>Does the Bi&s;hop comply with his own precept in the next page? (p. 175.) <Q>Old age &s;hould lenify, &s;hould &s;often men's manners, and make them more mild and gentle; but often has the contrary effect, hardens their hearts, and makes them more &s;our and crabbed.</Q> &mdash;He is &s;peaking of Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>Have I ever infinuated that preferment-hunting is the great occupation of an eccle|&s;ia&s;tical life? (Memoirs pa&s;&s;im); that a mini&s;ter's influence and a bi&s;hop's patronage are &s;ometimes pledged eleven deep? (p. 151.) that a prebendary con&s;iders the audit week as the better part of the year? (p. 127.) or that the mo&s;t eminent of prie&s;ts, the pope him&s;elf, would change their religion, if any thing better could be offered them? (p. 56.) Such things are more than in&s;inuated in the Bi&s;hop's Life, which afforded &s;ome &s;candal to the church, and &s;ome diver&s;ion to the profane laity.</P></NOTE>, who had faithfully and even cautiou&s;ly rendered Dr.

<P>I was however encouraged by &s;ome dome&s;tic and foreign te&s;timo|nies
of applau&s;e; and the &s;econd and third volumes in&s;en&s;ibly ro&s;e in
&s;ale and reputation to a level with the fir&s;t. But the public is &s;eldom
wrong; and I am inclined to believe that, e&s;pecially in the begin|ning,
they are more prolix and le&s;s entertaining than the fir&s;t: my
efforts had not been relaxed by &s;ucce&s;s, and I had rather deviated
into the oppo&s;ite fault of minute and &s;uperfluous diligence. On the
Continent, my name and writings were &s;lowly diffu&s;ed: a French
tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t volume had di&s;appointed the book&s;ellers of
Paris; and a pa&s;&s;age in the third was con&s;trued as a per&s;onal reflec|tion
on the reigning monarch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may not be generally known that Louis the Sixteenth is a great reader, and a reader of Engli&s;h books.

I &s;hall neither di&s;claim the allu&s;ion, nor examine the likene&s;s; but the &s;ituation of the late King of France excludes all &s;u&s;picion of flattery; and I am ready to declare that the concluding ob&s;ervations of my third volume were written before his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before I could apply for a &s;eat at the general election the li&s;t was
already full; but Lord North's promi&s;e was &s;incere, his recommend|ation
was effectual, and I was &s;oon cho&s;en on a vacancy for the
borough of Lymington, in Hamp&s;hire. In the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the
new parliament, admini&s;tration &s;tood their ground; their final over|throw
was re&s;erved for the &s;econd. The American war had once
been the favourite of the country: the pride of England was irritated
by the re&s;i&s;tance of her colonies, and the executive power was driven
by national clamour into the mo&s;t vigorous and coercive mea&s;ures.
But the length of a fruitle&s;s conte&s;t, the lo&s;s of armies, the accumu|lation
of debt and taxes, and the ho&s;tile confederacy of France, Spain,
and Holland, indi&s;po&s;ed the public to the American war, and the
<PB N="163" REF="188">
per&s;ons by whom it was conducted; the repre&s;entatives of the people,
followed, at a &s;low di&s;tance, the changes of their opinion; and the
mini&s;ters who refu&s;ed to bend, were broken by the tempe&s;t. As
&s;oon as Lord North had lo&s;t, or was about to lo&s;e, a majority in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, he &s;urrendered his office, and retired to a pri|vate
&s;tation, with the tranquil a&s;&s;urance of a clear con&s;cience and a
cheerful temper: the old fabric was di&s;&s;olved, and the po&s;ts of go|vernment
were occupied by the victorious and veteran troops of op|po&s;ition.
The lords of trade were not immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, but
the board it&s;elf was aboli&s;hed by Mr. Burke's bill, which decency
had compelled the patriots to revive; and I was &s;tripped of a conve|nient
&s;alary, after having enjoyed it about three years.</P>
<P>So flexible is the title of my Hi&s;tory, that the final aera might be
fixed at my own choice; and I long he&s;itated whether I &s;hould be
content with the three volumes, the fall of the We&s;tern empire,
which fulfilled my fir&s;t engagement with the public. In this interval
of &s;u&s;pence, nearly a twelvemonth, I returned by a natural impul&s;e
to the Greek authors of antiquity; I read with new plea&s;ure the
Iliad and the Ody&s;&s;ey, the Hi&s;tories of Herodotus, Thucydides,
and Xenophon, a large portion of the tragic and comic theatre of
Athens, and many intere&s;ting dialogues of the Socratic &s;chool. Yet
in the luxury of freedom I began to wi&s;h for the daily ta&s;k, the
active pur&s;uit, which gave a value to every book, and an object to
every inquiry: the preface of a new edition announced my de&s;ign,
and I dropped without reluctance from the age of Plato to that of
Ju&s;tinian. The original texts of Procopius and Agathias &s;upplied the
events and even the characters of his reign: but a laborious winter
was devoted to the Codes, the Pandects, and the modern interpre|ters,
before I pre&s;umed to form an ab&s;tract of the civil law. My
&s;kill was improved by practice, my diligence perhaps was quickened
by the lo&s;s of office; and, excepting the la&s;t chapter, I had fini&s;hed the
<PB N="164" REF="189">
fourth volume before I &s;ought a retreat on the banks of the Leman
Lake.</P>
<P>It is not the purpo&s;e of this narrative to expatiate on the public or
&s;ecret hi&s;tory of the times: the &s;chi&s;m which followed the death of
the Marquis of Rockingham, the appointment of the Earl of Shel|burne,
the re&s;ignation of Mr. Fox, and his famous coalition with
Lord North. But I may a&s;&s;ert, with &s;ome degree of a&s;&s;urance, that
in their political conflict tho&s;e great antagoni&s;ts had never felt any
per&s;onal animo&s;ity to each other, that their reconciliation was ea&s;y
and &s;incere, and that their friend&s;hip has never been clouded by the
&s;hadow of &s;u&s;picion or jealou&s;y. The mo&s;t violent or venal of their
re&s;pective followers embraced this fair occa&s;ion of revolt, but their
alliance &s;till commanded a majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons; the
peace was cen&s;ured, Lord Shelburne re&s;igned, and the two friends
knelt on the &s;ame cu&s;hion to take the oath of &s;ecretary of &s;tate.
From a principle of gratitude I adhered to the coalition: my vote
was counted in the day of battle, but I was overlooked in the divi|&s;ion
of the &s;poil. There were many claimants more de&s;erving and
importunate than my&s;elf: the board of trade could not be re&s;tored;
and, while the li&s;t of places was curtailed, the number of candidates
was doubled. An ea&s;y di&s;mi&s;&s;ion to a &s;ecure &s;eat at the board of
cu&s;toms or exci&s;e was promi&s;ed on the fir&s;t vacancy: but the chance
was di&s;tant and doubtful; nor could I &s;olicit with much ardour an
ignoble &s;ervitude, which would have robbed me of the mo&s;t valu|able
of my &s;tudious hours: at the &s;ame time the tumult of London,
and the attendance on parliament, were grown more irk&s;ome; and,
without &s;ome additional income, I could not long or prudently main|tain
the &s;tile of expence to which I was accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>From my early acquaintance with Lau&s;anne I had always cheri&s;hed
a &s;ecret wi&s;h, that the &s;chool of my youth might become the retreat
of my declining age. A moderate fortune would &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings
<PB N="165" REF="190">
of ea&s;e, lei&s;ure, and independence: the country, the people, the
manners, the language, were congenial to my ta&s;te; and I might in|dulge
the hope of pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome years in the dome&s;tic &s;ociety of a
friend. After travelling with &s;everal Engli&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Richard Wor&s;ley, Lord Che&s;terfield, Broderick Lord Midleton, and Mr. Hume, brother to Sir Abraham.</NOTE> Mr. Deyverdun was
now &s;ettled at home, in a plea&s;ant habitation, the gift of his decea&s;ed
aunt: we had long been &s;eparated, we had long been &s;ilent; yet in
my fir&s;t letter I expo&s;ed, with the mo&s;t perfect confidence, my &s;itu|ation,
my &s;entiments, and my de&s;igns. His immediate an&s;wer was
a warm and joyful acceptance: the picture of our future life pro|voked
my impatience; and the terms of arrangement were &s;hort
and &s;imple, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the property, and I undertook the ex|pence
of our common hou&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letters, No. CXXV. CXXVI. CXXVII. CXXVIII. CXXIX. CXXX.</NOTE> Before I could break my Engli&s;h
chain, it was incumbent on me to &s;truggle with the feelings of my
heart, the indolence of my temper, and the opinion of the world,
which unanimou&s;ly condemned this voluntary bani&s;hment. In the
di&s;po&s;al of my effects, the library, a &s;acred depo&s;it, was alone ex|cepted:
as my po&s;t-chai&s;e moved over We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge I bid a
long farewel to the <Q>fumum et opes &s;trepitum&abque; Romae.</Q> My jour|ney
by the direct road through France was not attended with any
accident, and I arrived at Lau&s;anne nearly twenty years after my
&s;econd departure. Within le&s;s than three months the coalition &s;truck
on &s;ome hidden rocks: had I remained on board, I &s;hould have
peri&s;hed in the general &s;hipwreck<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letter, No. CL.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Since my e&s;tabli&s;hment at Lau&s;anne, more than &s;even years have
elap&s;ed; and if every day has not been equally &s;oft and &s;erene, not
a day, not a moment, has occurred in which I have repented of my
choice. During my ab&s;ence, a long portion of human life, many
changes had happened: my elder acquaintance had left the &s;tage;
<PB N="166" REF="191">
virgins were ripened into matrons, and children were grown to the
age of manhood. But the &s;ame manners were tran&s;mitted from one
generation to another: my friend alone was an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure;
my name was not totally forgotten, and all were ambitious to wel|come
the arrival of a &s;tranger and the return of a fellow-citizen. The
fir&s;t winter was given to a general embrace, without any nice di&s;cri|mination
of per&s;ons and characters. After a more regular &s;ettlement,
a more accurate &s;urvey, I di&s;covered three &s;olid and permanent bene|fits
of my new &s;ituation. 1. My per&s;onal freedom had been &s;ome|what
impaired by the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Board of Trade;
but I was now delivered from the chain of duty and dependence,
from the hopes and fears of political adventure: my &s;ober mind was
no longer intoxicated by the fumes of party, and I rejoiced in my
e&s;cape, as often as I read of the midnight debates which preceded the
di&s;&s;olution of parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letter, No. CXLVI.</NOTE>. 2. My Engli&s;h oeconomy had been that
of a &s;olitary bachelor, who might afford &s;ome occa&s;ional dinners. In
Switzerland I enjoyed at every meal, at every hour, the free and plea|&s;ant
conver&s;ation of the friend of my youth; and my daily table was
always provided for the reception of one or two extraordinary
gue&s;ts. Our importance in &s;ociety is le&s;s a po&s;itive than a relative
weight: in London I was lo&s;t in the crowd; I ranked with the fir&s;t
families of Lau&s;anne, and my &s;tyle of prudent expence enabled me
to maintain a fair balance of reciprocal civilities. 3. In&s;tead of a
&s;mall hou&s;e between a &s;treet and a &s;table-yard, I began to occupy a
&s;pacious and convenient man&s;ion, connected on the north &s;ide with
the city, and open on the &s;outh to a beautiful and boundle&s;s horizon.
A garden of four acres had been laid out by the ta&s;te of Mr. Deyver|dun:
from the garden a rich &s;cenery of meadows and vineyards de|&s;cends
to the Leman Lake, and the pro&s;pect far beyond the Lake is
crowned by the &s;tupendous mountains of Savoy. My books and my
acquaintance had been fir&s;t united in London; but this happy po&s;i|tion
<PB N="167" REF="192">
of my library in town and country was finally re&s;erved for
Lau&s;anne. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every comfort in this triple alliance, I could
not be tempted to change my habitation with the changes of the
&s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>My friends had been kindly apprehen&s;ive that I &s;hould not be able
to exi&s;t in a Swi&s;s town at the foot of the Alps, after having &s;o long
conver&s;ed with the fir&s;t men of the fir&s;t cities of the world. Such lofty
connections may attract the curious, and gratify the vain; but I am
too mode&s;t, or too proud, to rate my own value by that of my a&s;&s;o|ciates;
and what&s;oever may be the fame of learning or genius, ex|perience
has &s;hewn me that the cheaper qualifications of politene&s;s
and good &s;en&s;e are of more u&s;eful currency in the commerce of life.
By many, conver&s;ation is e&s;teemed as a theatre or a &s;chool: but,
after the morning has been occupied by the labours of the library, I
wi&s;h to unbend rather than to exerci&s;e my mind; and in the interval
between tea and &s;upper I am far from di&s;daining the innocent amu&s;e|ment
of a game at cards. Lau&s;anne is peopled by a numerous
gentry, who&s;e companionable idlene&s;s is &s;eldom di&s;turbed by the
pur&s;uits of avarice or ambition: the women, though con&s;ined to a
dome&s;tic education, are endowed for the mo&s;t part with more ta&s;te
and knowledge than their hu&s;bands and brothers: but the decent
freedom of both &s;exes is equally remote from the extremes of &s;im|plicity
and refinement. I &s;hall add as a misfortune rather than a
merit, that the &s;ituation and beauty of the Pays de Vaud, the long
habits of the Engli&s;h, the medical reputation of Dr. Ti&s;&s;ot, and the
fa&s;hion of viewing the mountains and <HI>Glaciers,</HI> have opened us on
all &s;ides to the incur&s;ions of foreigners. The vi&s;its of Mr. and Ma|dame
Necker, of Prince Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia, and of Mr. Fox, may from
&s;ome plea&s;ing exceptions; but, in general, Lau&s;anne has appeared
mo&s;t agreeable in my eyes, when we have been abandoned to our
own &s;ociety. I had frequently &s;een Mr. Necker, in the &s;ummer of
1784, at a country hou&s;e near Lau&s;anne, where he compo&s;ed his
<PB N="168" REF="193">
Treati&s;e on the Admini&s;tration of the Finances. I have &s;ince, in
October 1790, vi&s;ited him in his pre&s;ent re&s;idence, the ca&s;tle and
barony of Copet, near Geneva. Of the merits and mea&s;ures of that
&s;tate&s;man various opinions may be entertained; but all impartial men
mu&s;t agree in their e&s;teem of his integrity and patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>In the month of Augu&s;t 1784, Prince Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia, in his way
to Paris, pa&s;&s;ed three days at Lau&s;anne. His military conduct has
been prai&s;ed by profe&s;&s;ional men; his character has been vilified by
the wit and malice of a daemon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoire Secret de la Cour de Berlin.</NOTE>; but I was flattered by his affabi|lity,
and entertained by his conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>In his tour of Switzerland (September 1788) Mr. Fox gave me
two days of free and private &s;ociety<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Letter in the Continuation, October 1, 1788.</NOTE>. He &s;eemed to feel, and even
to envy, the happine&s;s of my &s;ituation; while I admired the powers
of a &s;uperior man, as they are blended in his attractive character
with the &s;oftne&s;s and &s;implicity of a child. Perhaps no human being
was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, va|nity,
or fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>My tran&s;migration from London to Lau&s;anne could not be ef|fected
without interrupting the cour&s;e of my hi&s;torical labours. The
hurry of my departure, the joy of my arrival, the delay of my tools,
&s;u&s;pended their progre&s;s; and a full twelvemonth was lo&s;t before I
could re&s;ume the thread of regular and daily indu&s;try. A number
of books mo&s;t requi&s;ite and lea&s;t common had been previou&s;ly
&s;elected; the academical library of Lau&s;anne, which I could u&s;e as
my own, contained at lea&s;t the fathers and councils; and I have de|rived
&s;ome occa&s;ional &s;uccour from the public collections of Berne
and Geneva. The fourth volume was &s;oon terminated, by an ab|&s;tract
of the controver&s;ies of the Incarnation, which the learned
Dr. Prideaux was apprehen&s;ive of expo&s;ing to profane eyes. It had
been the original de&s;ign of the learned Dean Prideaux to write the
<PB N="169" REF="194">
hi&s;tory of the ruin of the Ea&s;tern Church. In this work it would
have been nece&s;&s;ary, not only to unravel all tho&s;e controver&s;ies
which the Chri&s;tians made about the hypo&s;tatical union, but al&s;o to
unfold all the niceties and &s;ubtle notions which each &s;ect entertained
concerning it. The pious hi&s;torian was apprehen&s;ive of expo&s;ing
that incomprehen&s;ible my&s;tery to the cavils and objections of unbe|lievers;
and he dur&s;t not, <Q>&s;eeing the nature of this book, venture
it abroad in &s;o wanton and lewd an age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See preface to the Life of Mahomet, p. 10, 11.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In the fifth and &s;ixth volumes the revolutions of the empire and

<P>It was not till after many de&s;igns, and many trials, that I pre|ferred,
as I &s;till prefer, the method of grouping my picture by na|tions;
and the &s;eeming neglect of chronological order is &s;urely com|pen&s;ated
by the &s;uperior merits of intere&s;t and per&s;picuity. The
&s;tyle of the fir&s;t volume is, in my opinion, &s;omewhat crude and ela|borate;
in the &s;econd and third it is ripened into ea&s;e, correctne&s;s,
and numbers; but in the three la&s;t I may have been &s;educed by
the facility of my pen, and the con&s;tant habit of &s;peaking one lan|guage
and writing another may have infu&s;ed &s;ome mixture of Gallic
idioms. Happily for my eyes, I have always clo&s;ed my &s;tudies with
the day, and commonly with the morning; and a long, but tem|perate,
labour has been accompli&s;hed, without fatiguing either the
mind or body; but when I computed the remainder of my time and
my ta&s;k, it was apparent that, according to the &s;ea&s;on of publica|tion,
the delay of a month would be productive of that of a year.
I was now &s;training for the goal, and in the la&s;t winter many even|ings
<PB N="170" REF="195">
were borrowed from the &s;ocial plea&s;ures of Lau&s;anne. I could
now wi&s;h that a pau&s;e, an interval, had been allowed for a &s;erious
revi&s;al.</P>
<P>I have pre&s;umed to mark the moment of conception: I &s;hall now
commemorate the hour of my final deliverance. It was on the day,
or rather night, of the 27th of June 1787, between the hours of
eleven and twelve, that I wrote the la&s;t lines of the la&s;t page, in a
&s;ummer-hou&s;e in my garden. After laying down my pen, I took
&s;everal turns in a <HI>berceau,</HI> or covered walk of acacias, which com|mands
a pro&s;pect of the country, the lake, and the mountains. The
air was temperate, the &s;ky was &s;erene, the &s;ilver orb of the moon
was reflected from the waters, and all nature was &s;ilent. I will not
di&s;&s;emble the fir&s;t emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom,
and, perhaps, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of my fame. But my pride was
&s;oon humbled, and a &s;ober melancholy was &s;pread over my mind, by
the idea that I had taken an everla&s;ting leave of an old and agreeable
companion, and that what&s;oever might be the future date of my
Hi&s;tory, the life of the hi&s;torian mu&s;t be &s;hort and precarious. I
will add two facts, which have &s;eldom occurred in the compo&s;ition
of &s;ix, or at lea&s;t of five, quartos. 1. My fir&s;t rough manu&s;cript,
without any intermediate copy, has been &s;ent to the pre&s;s. 2. Not a
&s;heet has been &s;een by any human eyes, excepting tho&s;e of the author
and the printer: the faults and the merits are exclu&s;ively my own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Extract from</HI> Mr. GIBBON's <HI>Common-place Book.</HI></Q>

<P>I cannot help recollecting a much more extraordinary fact, which
is affirmed of him&s;elf by Retif de la Bretorme, a voluminous and
original writer of French novels. He laboured, and may &s;till labour,
<PB N="171" REF="196">
in the humble office of corrector to a printing-hou&s;e; but this office
enabled him to tran&s;port an entire volume from his mind to the
pre&s;s; and his work was given to the public without ever having
been written with a pen.</P>
<P>After a quiet re&s;idence of four years, during which I had never
moved ten miles from Lau&s;anne, it was not without &s;ome reluct|ance
and terror that I undertook, in a journey of two hundred
leagues, to cro&s;s the mountains and the &s;ea. Yet this formidable
adventure was atchieved without danger or fatigue; and at the end
of a fortnight I found my&s;elf in Lord Sheffield's hou&s;e and library,
&s;afe, happy, and at home. The character of my friend (Mr. Hol|royd)
had recommended him to a &s;eat in parliament for Coventry,
the command of a regiment of light dragoons, and an Iri&s;h peerage.
The &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of his political writings have decided the public
opinion on the great que&s;tions of our commercial intere&s;t with Ame|rica
and Ireland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on the Commerce of the American States, by John Lord She&s;&s;ield, the 6th edition, London, 1784, in octavo.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;ale of his Ob&s;ervations on the American States was diffu&s;ive,
their effect beneficial; the Navigation Act, the palladium of Britain,
was defended, and perhaps &s;aved, by his pen; and he proves, by
the weight of fact and argument, that the mother-country may &s;ur|vive
and flouri&s;h after the lo&s;s of America. My friend has never
cultivated the arts of compo&s;ition; but his materials are copious and
correct, and he leaves on his paper the clear impre&s;&s;ion of an active
and vigorous mind. His "Ob&s;ervations on the Trade, Manufac|tures,
and pre&s;ent State of Ireland," were intended to guide the
indu&s;try, to correct the prejudices, and to a&s;&s;uage the pa&s;&s;ions of a
country which &s;eemed to forget that &s;he could be free and pro|&s;perous
only by a friendly connection with Great Britain. The con|cluding
ob&s;ervations are written with &s;o much ea&s;e and &s;pirit, that
they may be read by tho&s;e who are the lea&s;t intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="197">
He fell (in 1784) with the unpopular coalition; but his merit has
been acknowledged at the la&s;t general election, 1790, by the ho|nourable
invitation and free choice of the city of Bri&s;tol. During
the whole time of my re&s;idence in England I was entertained at
Sheffield-Place and in Downing-Street by his ho&s;pitable kindne&s;s;
and the mo&s;t plea&s;ant period was that which I pa&s;&s;ed in the dome&s;tic
&s;ociety of the family. In the larger circle of the metropolis I ob|&s;erved
the country and the inhabitants with the knowledge, and
without the prejudices, of an Engli&s;hman; but I rejoiced in the ap|parent
increa&s;e of wealth and pro&s;perity, which might be fairly
divided between the &s;pirit of the nation and the wi&s;dom of the mi|ni&s;ter.
All party-re&s;entment was now lo&s;t in oblivion: &s;ince I was
no man's rival, no man was my enemy. I felt the dignity of inde|pendence,
and as I a&s;ked no more, I was &s;atisfied with the general
civilities of the world. The hou&s;e in London which I frequented
with mo&s;t plea&s;ure and a&s;&s;iduity was that of Lord North. After
the lo&s;s of power and of &s;ight, he was &s;till happy in him&s;elf and
his friends; and my public tribute of gratitude and e&s;teem could no
longer be &s;u&s;pected of any intre&s;ted motive. Before my departure
from England, I was pre&s;ent at the augu&s;t &s;pectacle of Mr. Ha&s;tings's
trial in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall. It is not my province to ab&s;olve or con|demn
the Governor of India; but Mr. Sheridan's eloquence de|manded
my applau&s;e; nor could I hear without emotion the per|&s;onal
compliment which he paid me in the pre&s;ence of the Briti&s;h
nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;aid the facts that made up the volume of narrative were unparalleled in atro|ciou&s;ne&s;s, and that nothing equal in criminality was to be traced, either in ancient or modern hi&s;tory, in the correct periods of Tacitus or the luminous page of Gibbon. <HI>Morning Chronicle, June</HI> 14, 1788.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this di&s;play of genius, which blazed four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days,
I &s;hall &s;toop to a very mechanical circum&s;tance. As I was waiting
in the managers' box, I had the curio&s;ity to inquire of the &s;hort|hand
<PB N="173" REF="198">
writer, how many words a ready and rapid orator might pro|nounce
in an hour? From 7000 to 7500 was his an&s;wer. The me|dium
of 7200 will afford 120 words in a minute, and two words in
each &s;econd. But this computation will only apply to the Engli&s;h
language.</P>
<P>As the publication of my three la&s;t volumes was the principal ob|ject,
&s;o it was the fir&s;t care of my Engli&s;h journey. The previous
arrangements with the book&s;eller and the printer were &s;ettled in my
pa&s;&s;age through London, and the proofs, which I returned more
correct, were tran&s;mitted every po&s;t from the pre&s;s to Sheffield-Place.
The length of the operation, and the lei&s;ure of the country, allowed
&s;ome time to review my manu&s;cript. Several rare and u&s;eful books,
the A&s;&s;i&s;es de Jeru&s;alem, Ramu&s;ius de Bello C. P^a^r^o, the Greek Acts of
the Synod of Florence, the Statuta Urbis Romae, &amp;c. were procured,
and introduced in their proper places the &s;upplements which they af|forded.
The impre&s;&s;ion of the fourth volume had con&s;umed three
months. Our common intere&s;t required that we &s;hould move with
a quicker pace; and Mr. Strahan fulfilled his engagement, which
few printers could &s;u&s;tain, of delivering every week three thou&s;and
copies of nine &s;heets. The day of publication was, however, de|layed,
that it might coincide with the fifty-fir&s;t anniver&s;ary of my
own birth-day; the double fe&s;tival was celebrated by a cheerful
literary dinner at Mr. Cadell's hou&s;e; and I &s;eemed to blu&s;h while

<P>In the preface of the fourth volume, while I gloried in the name

I once, in a year's vi&s;it, entertain a wi&s;h of &s;ettling in my native
country. Britain is the free and fortunate i&s;land; but where is the
&s;pot in which I could unite the comforts and beauties of my e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
at Lau&s;anne? The tumult of London a&s;toni&s;hed my eyes
and ears; the amu&s;ements of public places were no longer adequate
to the trouble; the clubs and a&s;&s;emblies were filled with new faces and
young men; and our be&s;t &s;ociety, our long and late dinners, would
<PB N="179" REF="204">
&s;oon have been prejudicial to my health. Without any &s;hare in the
political wheel, I mu&s;t be idle and in&s;ignificant: yet the mo&s;t &s;plen|did
temptations would not have enticed me to engage a &s;econd time
in the &s;ervitude of parliament or office. At Tunbridge, &s;ome weeks
after the publication of my Hi&s;tory, I reluctantly quitted Lord and
Lady Sheffield, and, with a young Swi&s;s friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Wilhelm. de Severy.</NOTE>, whom I had intro|duced
to the Engli&s;h world, I pur&s;ued the road of Dover and Lau|&s;anne.
My habitation was embelli&s;hed in my ab&s;ence, and the la&s;t
divi&s;ion of books, which followed my &s;teps, increa&s;ed my cho&s;en
library to the number of between &s;ix and &s;even thou&s;and volumes.
My &s;eraglio was ample, my choice was free, my appetite was keen.
After a full repa&s;t on Homer and Ari&s;tophanes, I involved my&s;elf
in the philo&s;ophic maze of the writings of Plato, of which the dra|matic
is, perhaps, more intere&s;ting than the argumentative part:
but I &s;tepped a&s;ide into every path of inquiry which reading or re|flection
accidentally opened.</P>
<P>Alas! the joy of my return, and my &s;tudious ardour, were &s;oon
damped by the melancholy &s;tate of my friend Mr. Deyverdun. His
health and &s;pirits had long &s;uffered a gradual decline, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
apoplectic fits anounced his di&s;&s;olution; and before he expired, tho&s;e
who loved him could not wi&s;h for the continuance of his life. The
voice of rea&s;on might congratulate his deliverance, but the feelings
of nature and friend&s;hip could be &s;ubdued only by time: his ami|able
character was &s;till alive in my remembrance; each room, each

at my own philo&s;ophy, if a long interval of &s;tudy had not preceded
and followed the death of my friend. By his la&s;t will he left to me
the option of purcha&s;ing his hou&s;e and garden, or of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them
during my life, on the payment either of a &s;tipulated price, or of
<PB N="180" REF="205">
an ea&s;y retribution to his kin&s;man and heir. I &s;hould probably have
been tempted by the daemon of property, if &s;ome legal difficulties
had not been &s;tarted again&s;t my title: a conte&s;t would have been
vexatious, doubtful, and invidious; and the heir mo&s;t gratefully
&s;ub&s;cribed an agreement, which rendered my life-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion more
perfect, and his future condition more advantageous. Yet I had
often revolved the judicious lines in which Pope an&s;wers the objec|tions
of his long-&s;ighted friend:</P>
<LG>
<L>Pity to build without or child or wife;</L>
<L>Why, you'll enjoy it only all your life:</L>
<L>Well, if the u&s;e be mine, does it concern one,</L>
<L>Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon?</L>
</LG>
<P>The certainty of my tenure has allowed me to lay out a con&s;iderable
&s;um in improvements and alterations: they have been executed with
&s;kill and ta&s;te; and few men of letters, perhaps, in Europe, are &s;o de&s;ira|bly
lodged as my&s;elf. But I feel, and with the decline of years I &s;hall
more painfully feel, that I am alone in paradi&s;e. Among the circle
of my acquaintance at Lau&s;anne, I have gradually acquired the &s;olid
and tender friend&s;hip of a re&s;pectable family<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The family of de Severy.</NOTE>: the four per&s;ons of
whom it is compo&s;ed are all endowed with the virtues be&s;t adapted
to their age and &s;ituation; and I am encouraged to love the parents
as a brother, and the children as a father. Every day we &s;eek and
find the opportunities of meeting: yet even this valuable connection
cannot &s;upply the lo&s;s of dome&s;tic &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Within the la&s;t two or three years our tranquillity has been clouded
by the di&s;orders of France: many families at Lau&s;anne were alarmed
and affected by the terrors of an impending bankruptcy; but the re|volution,
or rather the di&s;&s;olution of the kingdom has been heard and
felt in the adjacent lands.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="206">
I beg leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my a&s;&s;ent to Mr. Burke's creed on the re|volution
of France. I admire his eloquence, I approve his politics,
I adore his chivalry, and I can almo&s;t excu&s;e his reverence for church
e&s;tabli&s;hments. I have &s;ometimes thought of writing a dialogue of
the dead, in which Lucian, Era&s;mus, and Voltaire &s;hould mutually
acknowledge the danger of expo&s;ing an old &s;uper&s;tition to the con|tempt
of the blind and fanatic multitude.</P>
<P>A &s;warm of emigrants of both &s;exes, who e&s;caped from the public
ruin, has been attracted by the vicinity, the manners, and the lan|guage
of Lau&s;anne; and our narrow habitations in town and coun|try
are now occupied by the fir&s;t names and titles of the departed
monarchy. The&s;e noble fugitives are entitled to our pity; they may
claim our e&s;teem, but they cannot, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind and
fortune, much contribute to our amu&s;ement. In&s;tead of looking
down as calm and idle &s;pectators on the theatre of Europe, our do|me&s;tic
harmony is &s;omewhat embittered by the infu&s;ion of party
&s;pirit: our ladies and gentlemen a&s;&s;ume the character of &s;elf-taught
politicians; and the &s;ober dictates of wi&s;dom and experience are
&s;ilenced by the clamour of the triumphant <HI>democrates.</HI> The fanatic
mi&s;&s;ionaries of &s;edition have &s;cattered the &s;eeds of di&s;content in our
cities and villages, which had flouri&s;hed above two hundred and fifty
years without fearing the approach of war, or feeling the weight of
government. Many individuals, and &s;ome communities, appear to
be infe&s;ted with the Gallic phrenzy, the wild theories of equal and
boundle&s;s freedom; but I tru&s;t that the body of the people will be
faithful to their &s;overeign and to them&s;elves; and I am &s;atisfied that
the failure or &s;ucce&s;s of a revolt would equally terminate in the ruin
of the country. While the ari&s;tocracy of Bern protects the happine&s;s,
it is &s;uperfluous to enquire whether it be founded in the rights, of
man: the oeconomy of the &s;tate is liberally &s;upplied without the aid
of taxes; and the magi&s;trates <HI>mu&s;t</HI> reign with prudence and equity,
&s;ince they are unarmed in the mid&s;t of an armed nation.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="207">
The revenue of Bern, excepting &s;ome &s;mall duties, is derived from
church lands, tithes, feudal rights, and intere&s;t of money. The re|public
has nearly 500,000l. &s;terling in the. Engli&s;h funds, and the
amount of their trea&s;ure is unknown to the citizens them&s;elves. For
my&s;elf (may the omen be averted) I can only declare, that the fir&s;t
&s;troke of a rebel drum would be the &s;ignal of my immediate de|parture.</P>
<P>When I contemplate the common lot of mortality, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge
that I have drawn a high prize in the lottery of life. The far
greater part of the globe is over&s;pread with barbari&s;m or &s;lavery: in
the civilized world, the mo&s;t numerous cla&s;s is condemned to igno|rance
and poverty; and the double fortune of my birth in a free and
enlightened country, in an honourable and wealthy family, is the
lucky chance of an unit again&s;t millions. The general probability is
about three to one, that a new-born infant will not live to complete
his fiftieth year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Buffon, Supplement &agrave; l'Hi&s;toire naturelle, tom. vii. page 158&mdash;164. of a given number of new-born infants, one half, by the fault of nature or man, is extin|gui&s;hed before the age of puberty and rea&s;on.&mdash;A melancholy calculation!</NOTE>.

improved by cultivation; but it may be que&s;tioned, whether &s;ome

the weeds of prejudice. 2. Since I have e&s;caped from the long perils

be ta&s;tele&s;s or bitter if their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion were not a&s;&s;ured by an annual
and adequate &s;upply. According to the &s;cale of Switzerland, I am a
rich man; and I am indeed rich, &s;ince my income is &s;uperior to my

<P>I am di&s;gu&s;ted with the affectation of men of letters, who com|plain
that they have renounced a &s;ub&s;tance for a &s;hadow; and that
their fame (which &s;ometimes is no in&s;upportable weight) affords a

WHEN I fir&s;t undertook to prepare Mr. Gibbon's Memoirs for
the pre&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;ed that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to introduce
&s;ome continuation of them, from the time when they cea&s;e, namely,
&s;oon after his return to Switzerland in the year 1788; but the exa|mination
of his corre&s;pondence with me &s;ugge&s;ted, that the be&s;t con|tinuation
would be the publication of his letters from that time to
his death. I &s;hall thus give more &s;atisfaction, by employing the
language of Mr. Gibbon, in&s;tead of my own; and the public will
&s;ee him in a new and (I think) an admirable light, as a writer of
letters. By the in&s;ertion of a few occa&s;ional &s;entences, I &s;hall obviate
the di&s;advantages that are apt to ari&s;e from an interrupted narration.
A prejudiced or a fa&s;tidious critic may condemn, perhaps, &s;ome parts
of the letters as trivial; but many readers, I flatter my&s;elf, will be
gratified by di&s;covering even in the&s;e my friend's affectionate feelings,
and his character in familiar life. His letters in general bear a &s;trong
re&s;emblance to the &s;tyle and turn of his conver&s;ation; the charac|teri&s;tics
of which were vivacity, elegance, and preci&s;ion, with know|ledge
a&s;toni&s;hingly exten&s;ive and correct. He never cea&s;ed to be
in&s;tructive and entertaining; and in general there was a vein of
plea&s;antry in his conver&s;ation which prevented its becoming languid,
even during a re&s;idence of many months with a family in the
country.</P>
<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed that he always arranged what he intended to
&s;ay, before he &s;poke; his quickne&s;s in conver&s;ation contradicts this
<PB N="188" REF="212">
notion: but it is very true, that before he &s;at down to write a note
or letter, he completely arranged in his mind what he meant to ex|pre&s;s.
he pur&s;ued the &s;ame method in re&s;pect to other compo&s;i|tion;
and he occa&s;ionally would walk &s;everal times about his apart|ment
before he had rounded a period to his ta&s;te. He has plea&s;antly
remarked to me, that it &s;ometimes co&s;t him many a turn before he
could throw a &s;entiment into a form that gratified his own critici&s;m.
His &s;y&s;tematic habit of arrangement in point of &s;tyle, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in his
in&s;tance, by an excellent memory and correct judgment, is much to
be recommended to tho&s;e who a&s;pire to any perfection in writing.</P>
<P>Although the Memoirs extend beyond the time of Mr. Gibbon's
return to Lau&s;anne, I &s;hall in&s;ert a few Letters, written immediately
after his arrival there, and combine them &s;o far as to include even the
la&s;t note which he wrote a few days previou&s;ly to his death. Some
of them contain few incidents; but they connect and carry on the
account either of his opinions or of his employment.</P>

<P>SATURDAY is now arrived, and I much doubt whether I &s;hall have
time to fini&s;h. I ro&s;e, as u&s;ual, about &s;even; but as I knew I &s;hould
have &s;o much time, you know it would have been ridiculous to
begin any thing before breakfa&s;t. When I returned from my break|fa&s;t-room
to the library, unluckily I found on the table &s;ome new
and intere&s;ting books, which in&s;tantly caught my attention; and
without injuring my corre&s;pondent, I could &s;afely be&s;tow a &s;ingle
hour to gratify my curio&s;ity. Some things which I found in them
in&s;en&s;ibly led me to other books, and other enquiries; the morning
has &s;tolen away, and I &s;hall be &s;oon &s;ummoned to dre&s;s and dine
with the two Severys, father and &s;on, who are returned from the
country on a di&s;agreeable errand, an illne&s;s of Madame, from which
&s;he is however recovering. Such is the faithful picture of my mind
and manners, and from a &s;ingle day <HI>di&s;ce omnes.</HI> After having been
&s;o long chained to the oar, in a &s;plendid galley indeed, I freely and
fairly enjoy my liberty as I promi&s;ed in my preface; range without
<PB N="191" REF="215">
control over the wide expan&s;e of my library; conver&s;e, as my fancy
prompts me, with poets and hi&s;torians, philo&s;ophers and orators, of
every age and language; and often indulge my meditations in the
invention and arrangement of mighty works, which I &s;hall probably
never find time or application to execute. My garden, ber&ccedil;eau, and
pavilion often varied the &s;cene of my &s;tudies; the beautiful weather
which we have enjoyed exhilarated my &s;pirits, and I again ta&s;ted the
wi&s;dom and happine&s;s of my retirement, till that happine&s;s was inter|rupted
by a very &s;erious calamity, which took from me for above a fort|night
all thoughts of &s;tudy, of amu&s;ement, and even of corre&s;pondence.
I mentioned in my fir&s;t letter the unea&s;ine&s;s I felt at poor Deyverdun's
declining health, how much the plea&s;ure of my life was embittered by
the &s;ight of a &s;uffering and languid friend. The joy of our meeting
appeared at fir&s;t to revive him; and, though not &s;atisfied, I began
to think, at lea&s;t to hope, that he was every day gaining ground;
when, alas! one morning I was &s;uddenly recalled from my ber&ccedil;eau
to the hou&s;e, with the dreadful intelligence of an apoplectic &s;troke;
I found him &s;en&s;ele&s;s: the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance was in&s;tantly collected; and
he had the aid of the genius and experience of Mr. Ti&s;&s;ot, and of the
a&s;&s;iduous care of another phy&s;ician, who for &s;ome time &s;carcely
quitted his bed&s;ide either night or day. While I was in momentary
dread of a relap&s;e, with a confe&s;&s;ion from his phy&s;icians that &s;uch a
relap&s;e mu&s;t be fatal, you will feel that I was much more to be
pitied than my friend. At length, art or nature triumphed over the
enemy of life. I was &s;oon a&s;&s;ured that all immediate danger was
pa&s;t; and now for many days I have had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing
him recover, though by &s;low degrees, his health and &s;trength, his
&s;leep and appetite. He now walks about the garden, and receives
his particular friends, but has not yet gone abroad. His future
health will depend very much upon his own prudence: but, at all
events, this has been a very &s;erious warning; and the &s;lighte&s;t indi&s;|po&s;ition
will hereafter a&s;&s;ume a very formidable a&s;pect. But let us
<PB N="192" REF="216">
turn from this melancholy &s;ubject.&mdash;The Man of the People e&s;caped
from the tumult, the bloody tumult of the We&s;tmin&s;ter election,
to the lakes and mountains of Switzerland, and I was informed
that he was arrived at the Lyon d'Or. I &s;ent a compliment; he
an&s;wered it in per&s;on, and &s;ettled at my hou&s;e for the remainder of
the day. I have eat and drank, and conver&s;ed and &s;at up all night
with Fox in England; but it never has happened, perhaps it never
can happen again, that I &s;hould enjoy him as I did that day, alone,
from ten in the morning till ten at night. Poor Deyverdun, before
his accident, wanted &s;pirits to appear, and has regretted it &s;ince.
Our conver&s;ation never flagged a moment; and he &s;eemed thoroughly
plea&s;ed with the place and with his company. We had little politics;
though he gave me, in a few words, &s;uch a character of Pitt, as one
great man &s;hould give of another his rival: much of books, from my
own, on which he flattered me very plea&s;antly, to Homer and the
Arabian Nights: much about the country, my garden (which he
under&s;tands far better than I do), and, upon the whole, I think he
envies me, and would do &s;o were he mini&s;ter. The next morning
I gave him a guide to walk him about the town and country, and in|vited
&s;ome company to meet him at dinner. The following day he
continued his journey to Bern and Zurich, and I have heard of him
by various means. The people gaze on him as a prodigy, but he
&s;hews little inclination to conver&s;e with them, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Our friend
<HI>Douglas</HI> has been curious, attentive, agreeable; and in every place
where he has re&s;ided &s;ome days, he has left acquaintance who
e&s;teem and regret him: I never knew &s;o clear and general an im|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>After this long letter I have yet many things to &s;ay, though none
of any pre&s;&s;ing con&s;equence. I hope you are not idle in the deliver|ance
of Beriton, though the late events and edicts in France begin

<P>BEFORE your letter, which I received ye&s;terday, I was in the
anxious &s;ituation of a king, who hourly expects a courier from his
general, with the news of a deci&s;ive engagement. I had ab&s;tained
from writing, for fear of dropping a word, or betraying a feeling,
which might render you too cautious or too bold. On the famous
8th of April, between twelve and two, I reflected that the bu&s;ine&s;s
was determined; and each &s;ucceeding day I computed the &s;peedy
approach of your me&s;&s;enger, with favourable or melancholy tidings.
When I broke the &s;eal, I expected to read, <Q>What a damned un|lucky
fellow you are! Nothing tolerable was offered, and I in|dignantly
withdrew the e&s;tate.</Q> I <HI>did</HI> remember the fate of poor
Lenborough, and I was afraid of your magnanimity, &amp;c. It is
whim&s;ical enough, but it is human nature, that I now begin to think
of the deep-rooted foundations of land, and the airy fabric of the
funds. I not only con&s;ent, but even wi&s;h, to have eight or ten thou|&s;and
pounds on a good mortgage. The pipe of wine you &s;ent to me
was &s;eized, and would have been confi&s;cated, if the government of
Berne had not treated me with the mo&s;t flattering and di&s;tingui&s;hed
civility: they not only relea&s;ed the wine, but they paid out of their own
pocket the &s;hares to which the bailiff and the informer were entitled
by law. I &s;hould not forget that the bailiff refu&s;ed to accept of his
part. Poor Deyverdun's con&s;titution is quite broken; he has had
two or three attacks, not &s;o violent as the fir&s;t: every time the door
is ha&s;tily opened, I expect to hear of &s;ome fatal accident: the be&s;t or
wor&s;t hopes of the phy&s;icians are only that he may linger &s;ome time
longer; but, if he lives till the &s;ummer, they propo&s;e &s;ending him to
&s;ome mineral waters at Aix, in Savoy. You will be glad to hear
that I am now a&s;&s;ured of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, during my life, this delightful
hou&s;e and garden. The act has been lately executed in the be&s;t
form, and the hand&s;ome&s;t manner. I know not what to &s;ay of your
<PB N="195" REF="219">
miracles at home: we rejoice in the king's recovery, and its mini&s;te|rial
con&s;equences; and I cannot be in&s;en&s;ible to the hope, at lea&s;t the
chance, of &s;eeing in this country a fir&s;t lord of trade, or &s;ecretary at
war. In your an&s;wer, which I &s;hall impatiently expect, you will
give me a full and true account of your de&s;igns, which by this time
mu&s;t have dropt, or be determined at lea&s;t, for the pre&s;ent year. If
you come, it is high time that we &s;hould look out for a hou&s;e&mdash;a
ta&s;k much le&s;s ea&s;y than you may po&s;&s;ibly imagine. Among new
books, I recommend to you the Count de Mirabeau's great work,
"Sur la Monarchie Pru&s;&s;ienne;" it is in your own way, and gives a
very ju&s;t and complete idea of that wonderful machine. His "Cor|re&s;pondence
Secrette" is diabolically good. Adieu. Ever yours.</P>

<P>YOU are in truth a wi&s;e, active, indefatigable, and ine&s;timable
friend; and as our virtues are often connected with our faults, if
you were more tame and placid, you would be perhaps of le&s;s u&s;e
and value. A very important and difficult tran&s;action &s;eems to be
nearly terminated with &s;ucce&s;s and mutual &s;atisfaction: we &s;eem to
run before the wind with a pro&s;perous gale; and, unle&s;s we &s;hould
&s;trike on &s;ome &s;ecret rocks which I do not fore&s;ee, &s;hall, on or
before the 31&s;t July, enter the harbour of Content; though I cannot
pur&s;ue the metaphor by adding we &s;hall <HI>land,</HI> &s;ince our operation is
of a very oppo&s;ite tendency. I could not ea&s;ily forgive my&s;elf for
&s;hutting you up in a dark room with parchments and attornies, did
I not reflect that this probably is the la&s;t material trouble that you
will ever have on my account; and that after the labours and delays
of twenty years, I &s;hall at la&s;t attain what I have always &s;ighed for,
a clear and competent income, above my wants, and equal to my
wi&s;hes. In this contemplation you will be &s;ufficiently rewarded. I
hope * * * * * will be content with our title-deeds, for I cannot furni&s;h
<PB N="196" REF="220">
another &s;hred of parchment. Mrs. Gibbon's jointure is &s;ecured on
the Beriton e&s;tate, and her legal con&s;ent is requi&s;ite for the &s;ale.
Again and again I mu&s;t repeat my hope that &s;he is perfectly &s;ati&s;|fied,
and that the clo&s;e of her life may not be embittered by &s;u&s;pi|cion,
or fear, or di&s;content. What new &s;ecurity does &s;he prefer,&mdash;
the funds, the mortgage, or your land? At all events &s;he mu&s;t be
made ea&s;y. I wrote to her again &s;ome time ago, and begged that if
&s;he were too weak to write, &s;he would de&s;ire Mrs. Gould or Mrs.
Holroyd to give me a line concerning her &s;tate of health. To this
no an&s;wer; I am afraid &s;he is di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now for the di&s;po&s;al of the money: I approve of the 8000l.
mortgage on Beriton; and honour your prudence in not &s;hewing,
by the compari&s;on of the rent and intere&s;t, how fooli&s;h it is to pur|cha&s;e
land. * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.
There is a chance of my drawing a con&s;iderable &s;um into this coun|try,
for an arrangement which you your&s;elf mu&s;t approve, but
which I have not time to explain at pre&s;ent. For the &s;ake of di&s;|patching,
by this evening's po&s;t, an an&s;wer to your letter which ar|rived
this morning, I confine my&s;elf to the <HI>needful,</HI> but in the
cour&s;e of a few days I will &s;end a more familiar epi&s;tle. Adieu.

<P>POOR Deyverdun is no more: he expired Saturday the 4th in&s;tant;
and in his unfortunate &s;ituation, death could only be viewed by him|&s;elf,
and by his friends, in the light of a con&s;ummation devoutly to
be wi&s;hed. Since September he has had a dozen apoplectic &s;trokes,
more or le&s;s violent: in the intervals between them his &s;trength gra|dually
decayed; every principle of life was exhau&s;ted; and had he
continued to drag a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, he mu&s;t probably have &s;ur|vived
the lo&s;s of his faculties. Of all misfortunes this was what he
<PB N="197" REF="221">
him&s;elf mo&s;t apprehended: but his rea&s;on was clear and calm to the
la&s;t; he beheld his approaching di&s;&s;olution with the firmne&s;s of a
philo&s;opher. I fancied that time and reflection had prepared me for
the event; but the habits of three-and-thirty years friend&s;hip are not
&s;o ea&s;ily broken. The fir&s;t days, and more e&s;pecially the fir&s;t nights,
were indeed painful. La&s;t Wedne&s;day and Saturday it would not
have been in my power to write. I mu&s;t now recollect my&s;elf, &s;ince
it is nece&s;&s;ary for me not only to impart the news, but to a&s;k your
opinion in a very &s;erious and doubtful que&s;tion, which mu&s;t be de|cided
without lo&s;s of time. I &s;hall &s;tate the facts, but as I am on the
&s;pot, and as new lights may occur, I do not promi&s;e implicit obe|dience.</P>
<P>Had my poor friend died without a will, a female <HI>fir&s;t</HI> cou&s;in
&s;ettled &s;omewhere in the north of Germany, and whom I believe he
had never &s;een, would have been his heir at law. In the next de|gree
he had &s;everal cou&s;ins; and one of the&s;e, an old companion, by
name Mr. de Montagny, he has cho&s;en for his heir. As this hou&s;e
and garden was the be&s;t and cleare&s;t part of poor Deyverdun's
fortune; as there is a heavy duty or fine (what they call <HI>lods</HI>) on
every change of property out of the legal de&s;cent; as Montagny has
a &s;mall e&s;tate and a large family, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome pro|vi&s;ion
in his favour. The will therefore leaves me the option of en|joying
this place during my life, on paying the &s;um of 250l. (I
reckon in Engli&s;h money) at pre&s;ent, and an annual rent of 30l.; or
el&s;e, of purcha&s;ing the hou&s;e and garden for a &s;um which, including
the duty, will amount to 2500l. If I value the rent of 30l. at
twelve years purcha&s;e, I may acquire my enjoyment for life at about
the rate of 600l.; and the remaining 1900l. will be the difference
between that tenure and ab&s;olute perpetual property. As you have
never accu&s;ed me of too much zeal for the intere&s;t of po&s;terity, you
will ea&s;ily gue&s;s which &s;cale at fir&s;t preponderated. I deeply felt the
advantage of acquiring, for the &s;maller &s;um, every po&s;&s;ible enjoy|ment,
<PB N="198" REF="222">
as long as I my&s;elf &s;hould be capable of enjoying: I rejected,
with &s;corn, the idea of giving 1900l. for ideal po&s;thumous property;
and I deemed it of little moment who&s;e name, after my death,
&s;hould be in&s;cribed on my hou&s;e and garden at Lau&s;anne. How
often did I repeat to my&s;elf the philo&s;ophical lines of Pope, which
&s;eem to determine the que&s;tion:</P>
<LG>
<L>Pray Heaven, cries Swift, it la&s;t as you go on;</L>
<L>I wi&s;h to God this hou&s;e had been your own.</L>
<L>Pity to build without or &s;on or wife:</L>
<L>Why, you'll enjoy it <HI>only</HI> all your life.</L>
<L>Well, if the u&s;e be mine, does it concern one,</L>
<L>Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon?</L>
</LG>
<P>In this &s;tate of &s;elf-&s;atisfaction I was not much di&s;turbed by all my
real or nominal friends, who exhort me to prefer the right of pur|cha&s;e:
among &s;uch friends, &s;ome are carele&s;s and &s;ome are ignorant;
and the judgment of tho&s;e, who are able and willing to form an opi|nion,
is often bia&s;&s;ed by &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h or &s;ocial affection, by &s;ome
vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible intere&s;t. But my own reflections have gradually
and forcibly driven me from my fir&s;t propen&s;ity; and the&s;e reflec|tions
I will now proceed to enumerate:</P>
<P>1. I can make this purcha&s;e with ea&s;e and prudence. As I have
had the plea&s;ure of <HI>not</HI> hearing from you very lately, I flatter my&s;elf
that you advance on a carpet road, and that almo&s;t by the receipt of
this letter (July 31&s;t) the acres of Beriton will be tran&s;muted into
&s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds: if the payment be not ab&s;olutely com|pleted
by that day, * * * * * will not &s;cruple, I &s;uppo&s;e, depo&s;iting the
2600l. at Go&s;ling's, to meet my draught. Should he he&s;itate, I can
de&s;ire Darrel to &s;ell <HI>quantum &s;ufficit</HI> of my &s;hort annuities. As &s;oon
as the new &s;ettlement of my affairs is made, I &s;hall be able, after
deducting this &s;um, to &s;quare my expence to my income, &amp;c.</P>
<P>2. On mature con&s;ideration, I am perhaps le&s;s &s;elfi&s;h and le&s;s phi|lo&s;ophical
than I appear at fir&s;t &s;ight: indeed, were I not &s;o, it
<PB N="199" REF="223">
would now be in my power to turn my fortune into life-annuities,
and let the Devil take the hindmo&s;t. I feel, (perhaps it is fooli&s;h,)
but I feel that this little paradi&s;e will plea&s;e me &s;till more when it is
ab&s;olutely my own; and that I &s;hall be encouraged in every im|provement
of u&s;e or beauty, by the pro&s;pect that, after my departure,
it will be enjoyed by &s;ome per&s;on of my own choice. I &s;ometimes
reflect with plea&s;ure that my writings will &s;urvive me; and that idea
is at lea&s;t as vain and chimerical.</P>
<P>3. The heir, Mr. de Montagny, is an old acquaintance. My &s;itua|tion
of a life-holder is rather new and &s;ingular in this country: the
laws have not provided for many nice ca&s;es which may ari&s;e between
the landlord and tenant: &s;ome I can fore&s;ee, others have been &s;ug|ge&s;ted,
many more I might feel when it would be too late. His
right of property might plague and confine me; he might forbid my
lending to a friend, in&s;pect my conduct, check my improvements,
call for &s;ecurities, repairs, &amp;c. But if I purcha&s;e, I walk on my
own terrace fierce and erect, the free ma&s;ter of one of the mo&s;t deli|cious
&s;pots on the globe.</P>
<P>Should I ever migrate homewards, (you &s;tare, but &s;uch an event
is le&s;s improbable than I could have thought it two years ago,) this
place would be di&s;puted by &s;trangers and natives.</P>
<P>Weigh the&s;e rea&s;ons, and &s;end me without delay a rational ex|plicit
opinion, to which I &s;hall pay &s;uch regard as the nature of cir|cum&s;tances
will allow. But, alas! when all is determined, I &s;hall
po&s;&s;e&s;s this hou&s;e, by what&s;oever tenure, without friend&s;hip or do|me&s;tic
&s;ociety. I did not imagine, &s;ix years ago, that a plan of life
&s;o congenial to my wi&s;hes, would &s;o &s;peedily vani&s;h. I cannot write
upon any other &s;ubject. Adieu, your's ever.</P>

<P>AFTER receiving and di&s;patching the power of attorny, la&s;t Wed|ne&s;day,
I opened, with &s;ome palpitation, the unexpected mi&s;&s;ive
<PB N="200" REF="224">
which arrived this morning. The peru&s;al of the contents &s;poiled
my breakfa&s;t. They are di&s;agreeable in them&s;elves, alarming in
their con&s;equences, and peculiarly unplea&s;ant at the pre&s;ent moment,
when I hoped to have formed and &s;ecured the arrangements of my
future life. I do not perfectly under&s;tand what are the&s;e deeds
which are &s;o inflexibly required; the wills and marriage-&s;ettlements
I have &s;ufficiently an&s;wered. But your arguments do not convince
* * * * *, and I have very little hope from the Lenborough &s;earch.
What will be the event? If his objections are only the re&s;ult of
legal &s;crupulo&s;ity, &s;urely they might be removed, and every chink
might be filled, by a general bond of indemnity, in which I boldly
a&s;k you to join, as it will be a &s;ub&s;tantial important act of friend|&s;hip,
without any po&s;&s;ible ri&s;k to your&s;elf or your &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Should
he &s;till remain obdurate, I mu&s;t believe what I already &s;u&s;pect, that
* * * repents of his purcha&s;e, and wi&s;hes to elude the conclu&s;ion.
Our ca&s;e would be then hopele&s;s, <HI>ibi omnis effu&s;us labor,</HI> and the
e&s;tate would be returned on our hands with the taint of a bad title.
The refu&s;al of mortgage does not plea&s;e me; but &s;urely our offer
&s;hews &s;ome confidence in the goodne&s;s of my title. If he will not
take eight thou&s;and pounds at <HI>four per cent.</HI> we mu&s;t look out el&s;e|where;
new doubts and delays will ari&s;e, and I am per&s;uaded that
you will not place an implicit confidence in any attorney. I know
not as yet your opinion about my Lau&s;anne purcha&s;e. If you are
again&s;t it, the pre&s;ent po&s;ition of affairs gives you great advantage,
&amp;c. &amp;c. The Severys are all well; an uncommon circum&s;tance for
the four per&s;ons of the family at once. They are now at Mex, a
country-hou&s;e &s;ix miles from hence, which I vi&s;it to-morrow for
two or three days. They often come to town, and we &s;hall contrive
to pa&s;s a part of the autumn together at Rolle. I want to change
the &s;cene; and beautiful as the garden and pro&s;pect mu&s;t appear to
every eye, I feel that the &s;tate of my own mind ca&s;ts a gloom over
them; every &s;pot, every walk, every bench, recals the memory of
<PB N="201" REF="225">
tho&s;e hours, of tho&s;e conver&s;ations, which will return no more. But
I tear my&s;elf from the &s;ubject. I could not help writing to-day,
though I do not find I have &s;aid any thing very material. As you
mu&s;t be con&s;cious that you have agitated me, you will not po&s;tpone
any agreeable, or even <HI>deci&s;ive</HI> intelligence. I almo&s;t he&s;itate, whe|ther
I &s;hall run over to England, to con&s;ult with you on the &s;pot,
and to fly from poor Deyverdun's &s;hade, which meets me at every
turn. I did not expect to have felt his lo&s;s &s;o &s;harply. But &s;ix hun|dred
miles! Why are we &s;o far off?</P>
<P>Once more, What is the difficulty of the title? Will men of
&s;en&s;e, in a &s;en&s;ible country, never get rid of the tyranny of lawyers?
more oppre&s;&s;ive and ridiculous than even the old yoke of the clergy.
Is not a term of &s;eventy or eighty years, nearly twenty in my own
per&s;on, &s;ufficient to prove our legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? Will not the records
of fines and recoveries atte&s;t that <HI>I</HI> am free from any bar of entails
and &s;ettlements? Con&s;ult &s;ome &s;age of the law, whether their pre|&s;ent
demand be nece&s;&s;ary and legal. If your ground be firm, force
them to execute the agreement or forfeit the depo&s;it. But if, as I
much fear, they have a right, and a wi&s;h, to elude the con&s;ummation,
would it not be better to relea&s;e them at once, than to be hung up
for five years, as in the ca&s;e of Lovegrove, which co&s;t me in the
end four or five thou&s;and pounds? You are bold, you are wi&s;e;
con&s;ult, re&s;olve, act. In my penultimate letter I dropped a &s;trange
hint, that a migration homeward was not impo&s;&s;ible. I know not
what to &s;ay; my mind is all afloat; yet you will not reproach me with
caprice or incon&s;tancy. How many years did you damn my &s;cheme
of retiring to Lau&s;anne! I executed that plan; I found as much
happine&s;s as is compatible with human nature, and during four
years (1783&mdash;1787) I never breathed a &s;igh of repentance. On
my return from England the &s;cene was changed: I found only a
faint &s;emblance of Deyverdun, and that &s;emblance was each day
fading from my &s;ight. I have pa&s;&s;ed an anxious year, but my
<PB N="202" REF="226">
anxiety is now at an end, and the pro&s;pect before me is a melan|choly
&s;olitude. I am &s;till deeply rooted in this country; the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of this paradi&s;e, the friend&s;hip of the Severys, a mode of
&s;ociety &s;uited to my ta&s;te, and the enormous trouble and <HI>expence</HI> of
a migration. Yet in England (when the pre&s;ent clouds are di&s;pelled)
I could form a very comfortable e&s;tabli&s;hment in London, or rather
at Bath; and I have a very noble country-&s;eat at about ten miles
from Ea&s;t Grin&s;tead in Su&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to Sheffield-Place.</NOTE>. That &s;pot is dearer to me than the
re&s;t of the three kingdoms; and I have &s;ometimes wondered how
two men, &s;o oppo&s;ite in their tempers and pur&s;uits, &s;hould have im|bibed
&s;o long and lively a propen&s;ity for each other. Sir Stanier
Porten is ju&s;t dead. He has left his widow with a moderate pen&s;ion,
and two children, my neare&s;t relations: the elde&s;t, Charlotte, is
about Loui&s;a's age, and al&s;o a mo&s;t amiable &s;en&s;ible young creature.
I have conceived a romantic idea of educating and adopting her;
as we de&s;cend into the vale of years our infirmities require &s;ome do|me&s;tic
female &s;ociety: Charlotte would be the comfort of my age,
and I could reward her care and tenderne&s;s with a decent fortune.
A thou&s;and difficulties oppo&s;e the execution of the plan, which I
have never opened but to you; yet it would be le&s;s impracticable
in England than in Switzerland. Adieu. I am wounded; pour
&s;ome oil into my wounds: yet I am le&s;s unhappy &s;ince I have
thrown my mind upon paper.</P>
<P>Are you not amazed at the French revolution? They have the
power, will they have the moderation, to e&s;tabli&s;h a good con&s;ti|tution?

<P>WITHIN an hour after the reception of your la&s;t, I drew my
pen for the purpo&s;e of a reply, and my exordium ran in the following
words: <Q>I find by experience, that it is much more rational, as well

as ea&s;y, to an&s;wer a letter of real bu&s;ine&s;s by the return of the

<P>1. I was indeed in low &s;pirits when I &s;ent what you &s;o ju&s;tly &s;tile
my di&s;mal letter; but I do a&s;&s;ure you, that my own feelings con|tributed
much more to &s;ink me, than any events or terrors relative to
the &s;ale of Beriton. But I again hope and tru&s;t, from your con&s;o|latory
epi&s;tle, that, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>2. My Swi&s;s tran&s;action has &s;uffered a great alteration. I &s;hall
not become the proprietor of my hou&s;e and garden at Lau&s;anne, and
I relinqui&s;h the phantom with more regret than you could ea&s;ily
imagine. But I have been determined by a difficulty, which at fir&s;t
appeared of little moment, but which has gradually &s;welled to an
alarming magnitude. There is a law in this country, as well as in
&s;ome provinces of France, which is &s;tyled <HI>le droit de retrait, le retrait
lignagere,</HI> (Lord Loughborough mu&s;t have heard of it,) by which
the relations of the decea&s;ed are entitled to redeem a hou&s;e or e&s;tate
at the price for which it has been &s;old; and as the &s;um fixed by
poor Deyverdun is much below its known value, a crowd of compe|titors
are beginning to &s;tart. The be&s;t opinions (for they are di|vided)
are in my favour, that I am not &s;ubject to <HI>le droit de retrait,</HI>
&s;ince I take not as a purcha&s;er, but as a legatee. But the words of
the will are &s;omewhat ambiguous, the event of law is always uncer|tain,
the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice at Bern (the la&s;t appeal) depends
too much on favour and intrigue; and it is very doubtful whether I
could revert to the life-holding, after having cho&s;en and lo&s;t the
<PB N="204" REF="228">
property. The&s;e con&s;iderations engaged me to open a negociation
with Mr. de Montagny, through the medium of my friend the judge;
and as he mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hes to keep the hou&s;e, he con&s;ented,
though with &s;ome reluctance, to my propo&s;als. Ye&s;terday he &s;igned
a covenant in the mo&s;t regular and binding form, by which he
allows my power of transferring my intere&s;t, interprets in the mo&s;t
ample &s;en&s;e my right of making alterations, and expre&s;sly renounces
all claim, as landlord, of vi&s;iting or in&s;pecting the premi&s;es. I have
promi&s;ed to lend him twelve thou&s;and livres, (between &s;even and
eight hundred pounds,) &s;ecured on the hou&s;e and land. The mort|gage
is four times its value; the intere&s;t of four pounds <HI>per cent.</HI> will
be annually di&s;charged by the rent of thirty guineas. So that I am
now tranquil on that &s;core for the remainder of my days. I hope
that time will gradually reconcile me to the place which I have in|habited
with my poor friend; for in &s;pite of the <HI>cream</HI> of London,
I am &s;till per&s;uaded that no other place is &s;o well adapted to my ta&s;te
and habits of &s;tudious and &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>Far from delighting in the whirl of a metropolis, my only com|plaint
again&s;t Lau&s;anne is the great number of &s;trangers, always of
Engli&s;h, and now of French, by whom we are infe&s;ted in &s;ummer.
Yet we have e&s;caped the <HI>damned</HI> great ones, the Count d'Artois, the
Polignacs, &amp;c. who &s;lip by us to Turin. What a &s;cene is France!
While the a&s;&s;embly is voting ab&s;tract propo&s;itions, Paris is an inde|pendent
republic; the provinces have neither authority nor freedom,
and poor Necker declares that credit is no more, and that the people
refu&s;e to pay taxes. Yet I think you mu&s;t be &s;educed by the abo|lition
of tithes. If Eden goes to Paris you may have &s;ome curious
information. Give me &s;ome account of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas. Do
they live with Lord North? I hope they do. When will parlia|ment
be di&s;&s;olved? Are you &s;till Coventry-mad? I embrace my
Lady, the &s;prightly Maria, and the &s;miling Loui&s;a. Alas! alas!
you will never come to Switzerland. Adieu, ever yours.</P>

<L>Alas! what perils do environ</L>
<L>The man who meddles with cold iron.</L>
</LG>
<P>ALAS! what delays and difficulties do attend the man who meddles
with legal and landed bu&s;ine&s;s! Yet if it be only to di&s;appoint your
expectation, I am not &s;o very nervous at this new provoking ob|&s;tacle.
I had totally forgotten the deed in que&s;tion, which was con|trived
in the la&s;t year of my father's life, to tie his hands and regu|late
the di&s;order of his affairs; and which might have been &s;o ea&s;ily
cancelled by Sir Stanier, who had not the &s;malle&s;t intere&s;t in it,
either for him&s;elf or his family. The amicable &s;uit, which is now
become nece&s;&s;ary, mu&s;t, I think, be &s;hort and unambiguous, yet I
cannot help dreading the crotchets, that lurk under the chancellor's
great wig; and, at all events, I fore&s;ee &s;ome additional delay and
expence. The golden pill of the two thou&s;and eight hundred pounds
has &s;oothed my di&s;content; and if it be &s;afely lodged with the Go&s;|lings,
I agree with you, in con&s;idering it as an unequivocal pledge of
a fair and willing purcha&s;er. It is indeed chiefly in that light I now
rejoice in &s;o large a depo&s;it, which is no longer nece&s;&s;ary in its full
extent. You are appri&s;ed by my la&s;t letter that I have reduced
my&s;elf to the life-enjoyment of the hou&s;e and garden. And, in
&s;pite of my feelings, I am every day more convinced that I have
cho&s;en the &s;afer &s;ide. I believe my cau&s;e to have been good, but
it was doubtful. Law in this country is not &s;o expen&s;ive as in
England, but it is more trouble&s;ome; I mu&s;t have gone to Bern,
have &s;olicited my judges in per&s;on; a vile cu&s;tom! the event was
uncertain; and during at lea&s;t two years, I &s;hould have been in a
&s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and anxiety; till the conclu&s;ion of which it would
have been madne&s;s to have attempted any alteration or improvement.
According to my pre&s;ent arrangement I &s;hall want no more than
eleven hundred pounds of the two thou&s;and, and I &s;uppo&s;e you will
<PB N="206" REF="230">
direct Go&s;ling to lay out the remainder in India bonds, that it may
not lie quite dead, while I am accountable to * * * * for the in|tere&s;t.
The elderly lady in a male habit, who informed me that
York&s;hire is a regi&s;ter county, is a certain judge, one Sir William
Black&s;tone, who&s;e name you may po&s;&s;ibly have heard. After &s;tating
the danger of purcha&s;ers and creditors, with regard to the title of
e&s;tates on which they lay out or lend their money, he thus con|tinues:
<Q>In Scotland every act and event regarding the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion
of property is regularly entered on record; and &s;ome of our own
provincial divi&s;ions, particularly the extended county of York
and the populous county of Middle&s;ex, have prevailed with the
legi&s;lature to erect &s;uch regi&s;ters in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts.</Q>
(Black&s;tone's Commentaries, vol. ii. p. 343, edition of 1774, in
quarto.) If I am mi&s;taken, it is in pretty good company; but I
&s;u&s;pect that we are all right, and that the regi&s;ter is confined to one
or two ridings. As we have, alas! two or three months before us, I
&s;hould hope that your prudent &s;agacity will di&s;cover &s;ome &s;ound
land, in ca&s;e you &s;hould not have time to arrange another mortgage.
I now write in a hurry, as I am ju&s;t &s;etting out for Rolle, where I
&s;hall be &s;ettled with cook and &s;ervants in a plea&s;ant apartment, till
the middle of November. The Severys have a hou&s;e there, where
they pa&s;s the autumn. I am not &s;orry to vary the &s;cene for a few
weeks, and I wi&s;h to be ab&s;ent while &s;ome alterations are making in
my hou&s;e at Lau&s;anne. I wi&s;h the change of air may be of &s;ervice to
Severy the father, but we do not at all like his pre&s;ent &s;tate of health.
How completely, alas, how completely! could I now lodge you:
but your firm re&s;olve of making me a vi&s;it &s;eems to have vani&s;hed
like a dream. Next &s;ummer you will not find five hundred pounds
for a rational friendly expedition; and &s;hould parliament be di&s;|&s;olved,
you will perhaps find five thou&s;and for&mdash;. I cannot
think of it with patience. Pray take &s;erious &s;trenuous mea&s;ures for
&s;ending me a pipe of excellent Madeira in ca&s;k, with &s;ome dozens
<PB N="207" REF="231">
of Malm&s;ey Madeira. It &s;hould be con&s;igned to Me&s;&s;rs. Romberg
Voituriers at O&s;tend, and I mu&s;t have timely notice of its march.
We have &s;o much to &s;ay about France, that I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall never
&s;ay any thing. That country is now in a &s;tate of di&s;&s;olution. Adieu.</P>

<P>YOU have often rea&s;on to accu&s;e my &s;trange &s;ilence and neglect in
the mo&s;t important of <HI>my own</HI> affairs; for I will pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert,
that in a bu&s;ine&s;s of yours of equal con&s;equence, you &s;hould not
find me cold or carele&s;s. But on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion my &s;ilence is,
perhaps, the highe&s;t compliment I ever paid you. You remember
the an&s;wer of Philip of Macedon: <Q>Philip may &s;leep, while he
knows that Parmenio is awake.</Q> I expected, and, to &s;ay the
truth, I wi&s;hed that my Parmenio would have decided and acted,
without expecting my dilatory an&s;wer, and in his deci&s;ion I &s;hould
have acquie&s;ced with implicit confidence. But &s;ince you will have
my opinion, let us con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my affairs. In the
cour&s;e of my life I have often known, and &s;ometimes felt, the dif|ficulty
of getting money, but I now find my&s;elf involved in a more
&s;ingular di&s;tre&s;s, the difficulty of placing it, and if it continues much
longer, I &s;hall almo&s;t wi&s;h for my land again.</P>
<P>I perfectly agree with you, that it is bad management to purcha&s;e
in the funds when they do not yield four pounds <HI>per cent.</HI> *
* * * * * * * * * * * *.
Some of this money I can place &s;afely, by means of my banker
here; and I &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s, what I have always de&s;ired, a command of
ca&s;h, which I cannot abu&s;e to my prejudice, &s;ince I have it in my
power to &s;upply with my pen any extraordinary or fanciful in|dulgence
of expence. And &s;o much, much indeed, for pecuniary
matters. What would you have me &s;ay of the affairs of France?
We are too near, and too remote, to form an accurate judgment of
that wonderful &s;cene. The abu&s;es of the court and government
<PB N="208" REF="232">
called aloud for reformation; and it has happened, as it will always
happen, tha an innocent well-di&s;po&s;ed Prince has paid the forfeit of
the &s;ins of his predece&s;&s;ors; of the ambition of Lewis the Fourteenth,
of the profu&s;ion of Lewis the Fifteenth. The French nation had a
glorious opportunity, but they have abu&s;ed, and may lo&s;e their ad|vantages.
If they had been content with a liberal tran&s;lation of our
&s;y&s;tem, if they had re&s;pected the prerogatives of the crown, and the
privileges of the nobles, they might have rai&s;ed a &s;olid fabric on the
only true foundation, the natural ari&s;tocracy of a great country.
How different is the pro&s;pect! Their King brought a captive to
Paris, after his palace had been &s;tained with the blood of his guards;
the nobles in exile; the clergy plundered in a way which &s;trikes at
the root of all property; the capital an independent republic; the
union of the provinces di&s;&s;olved; the flames of di&s;cord kindled by
the wor&s;t of men; (in that light I con&s;ider Mirabeau;) and the
hone&s;te&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly, a &s;et of wild vi&s;ionaries, (like our Dr.
Price,) who gravely debate, and dream about the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
a pure and perfect democracy of five-and-twenty millions, the vir|tues
of the golden age, and the primitive rights and equality of
mankind, which would lead, in fair rea&s;oning, to an equal partition
of lands and money. How many years mu&s;t elap&s;e before France
can recover any vigour, or re&s;ume her &s;tation among the Powers of
Europe! As yet, there is no &s;ymptom of a great man, a Richlieu
or a Cromwell, ari&s;ing, either to re&s;tore the monarchy, or to lead the
commonwealth. The weight of Paris, more deeply engaged in the
funds than <HI>all</HI> the re&s;t of the kingdom, will long delay a bank|ruptcy;
and if it &s;hould happen, it will be, both in the cau&s;e and
the effect, a mea&s;ure of weakne&s;s, rather than of &s;trength. You
&s;end me to Chamberry, to &s;ee a Prince and an Archbi&s;hop. Alas!
we have exiles enough here, with the Mar&s;hal de Ca&s;tries and the
Duke de Guignes at their head; and this inundation of &s;trangers,
which u&s;ed to be confined to the &s;ummer, will now &s;tagnate all the
<PB N="209" REF="233">
winter. The only ones whom I have &s;een with plea&s;ure are
Mr. Mounier, the late pre&s;ident of the national a&s;&s;embly, and the
Count de Lally; they have both dined with me. Mounier, who is
a &s;erious dry politician, is returned to Dauphine. Lally is an ami|able
man of the world, and a poet: he pa&s;&s;es the winter here. You
know how much I prefer a quiet &s;elect &s;ociety to a crowd of
names and titles, and that I always &s;eek conver&s;ation with a view
to amu&s;ement, rather than information. What happy countries
are England and Switzerland, if they know and pre&s;erve their
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have a thou&s;and things to &s;ay to my Lady, Maria, and Loui&s;a,
but I can add only a &s;hort po&s;t&s;cript about the Madeira. Good Ma|deira
is now become e&s;&s;ential to my health and reputation. May
your hog&s;head prove as good as the la&s;t; may it not be intercepted
by the rebels or the Au&s;trians. What a &s;cene again in that country!
Happy England! Happy Switzerland! I again repeat, adieu.</P>

<P>YOUR two la&s;t epi&s;tles, of the 7th and 11th in&s;tant, were &s;omewhat
delayed on the road; they arrived within two days of each other,
the la&s;t this morning (the 27th); &s;o that I an&s;wer by the fir&s;t, or
at lea&s;t by the &s;econd po&s;t. Upon the whole, your French method,
though &s;ometimes more rapid, appears to me le&s;s &s;ure and &s;teady
than the old German highway, &amp;c. &amp;c. * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * *
But enough of this. A new and brighter pro&s;pect &s;eems to be break|ing
upon us, and few events of <HI>that kind</HI> have ever given me more
plea&s;ure than your &s;ucce&s;sful negociation and * * * *'s &s;atisfactory
an&s;wer. The agreement is, indeed, equally convenient for both
parties: no time or expence will be wa&s;ted in &s;crutinizing the title of
the e&s;tate; the intere&s;t will be &s;ecured by the clau&s;e of five <HI>per cent.</HI>
and I lament with you, that no larger &s;um than eight thou&s;and

But I wi&s;h you to choo&s;e and execute one or the other of the&s;e ar|rangements

the repetition of dirty land and vile money; when we may expatiate
on the politics of the world and our per&s;onal &s;entiments. Without
expecting your an&s;wer of bu&s;ine&s;s, I mean to write &s;oon in a purer
&s;tyle, and I wi&s;h to lay open to my friend the &s;tate of my mind,
which (exclu&s;ive of all worldly concerns) is not perfectly at ea&s;e.
In the mean while, I mu&s;t add two or three &s;hort articles. 1. I am

<P>SINCE the fir&s;t origin (<HI>ab ovo</HI>) of our connection and corre&s;pond|ence,
&s;o long an interval of &s;ilence has not intervened, as far as I
remember, between us, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>From my &s;ilence you conclude that the moral complaint, which I
had in&s;inuated in my la&s;t, is either in&s;ignificant or fanciful. The con|clu&s;ion
is ra&s;h. But the complaint in que&s;tion is of the nature of a &s;low
lingering di&s;ea&s;e, which is not attended with any immediate danger.
As I have not lei&s;ure to expatiate, take the idea in three words: <Q>Since
the lo&s;s of poor Deyverdun, I am <HI>alone;</HI> and even in Paradi&s;e, &s;o|litude
is painful to a &s;ocial mind. When I was a dozen years
younger, I <HI>&s;carcely</HI> felt the weight of a &s;ingle exi&s;tence amid&s;t the
crowds of London, of parliament, of clubs; but it will pre&s;s more
<PB N="211" REF="235">
heavily upon me in this tranquil land, in the decline of life, and
with the increa&s;e of infirmities. Some expedient, even the mo&s;t
de&s;perate, mu&s;t be embraced, to &s;ecure the dome&s;tic &s;ociety of a
male or female companion. But I am not in a hurry; there is
time for reflection and advice.</Q> During this winter &s;uch &s;iner
feelings have been &s;u&s;pended by the gro&s;&s;er evil of bodily pain. On
the ninth of February I was &s;eized by &s;uch a fit of the gout as I had
never known, though I mu&s;t be thankful that its dire effects have
been confined to the feet and knees, without a&s;cending to the more
noble parts. With &s;ome vici&s;&s;itudes of better and wor&s;e, I have
groaned between two and three months; the debility has &s;urvived
the pain, and though now ea&s;y, I am carried about in my chair,
without any power, and with a very di&s;tant chance, of &s;upporting
my&s;elf, from the extreme weakne&s;s and contraction of the joints of
my knees. Yet I am happy in a &s;kilful phy&s;ician, and kind a&s;&s;idu|ous
friends: every evening, during more than three months, has
been enlivened (excepting when I have been forced to refu&s;e them) by
&s;ome cheerful vi&s;its, and very often by a cho&s;en party of both &s;exes.
How different is &s;uch &s;ociety from the &s;olitary evenings which I
have pa&s;&s;ed in the tumult of London! It is not worth while fighting
about a &s;hadow, but &s;hould I ever return to England, Bath, not the
metropolis, would be my la&s;t retreat.</P>
<P>Your portrait is at la&s;t arrived in perfect condition, and now oc|cupies
a con&s;picuous place over the chimney-gla&s;s in my library. It
is the object of general admiration; good judges (the few) applaud
the work; the name of Reynolds opens the eyes and mouths of the
many; and were not I afraid of making you vain, I would inform
you that the original is not allowed to be more than five-and-thirty.
In &s;pite of private reluctance and public di&s;content, I have honour|ably
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>my&s;elf</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His portrait.</NOTE>. I &s;hall arrive at Sir Jo&s;hua's before the end
of the month; he will give me a look, and perhaps a touch; and
<PB N="212" REF="236">
you will be indebted to the pre&s;ident one guinea for the carriage.
Do not be nervous, I am not rolled up; had I been &s;o, you might
have gazed on my charms four months ago. I want &s;ome account
of your&s;elf, of my Lady, (&s;hall we never directly corre&s;pond?) of
Loui&s;a, and of Maria. How has the latter &s;ince her launch &s;up|ported
a quiet winter in Su&s;&s;ex? I &s;o much rejoice in your divorce
from that b&mdash;Kitty Coventry, that I care not what marriage you
contract. A great city would &s;uit your dignity, and the duties
which would kill me in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, would &s;upply your activity
with a con&s;tant fund of amu&s;ement. But tread &s;oftly and &s;urely;
the ice is deceitful, the water is deep, and you may be &s;ou&s;ed over
head and ears before you are aware. Why did not you or Elm&s;ley
&s;end me the African pamphlet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on the Project for aboli&s;hing the Slave Trade, by Lord Sheffield.</NOTE> by the po&s;t? it would not have
co&s;t much. You have &s;uch a knack of turning a nation, that I am
afraid you will triumph (perhaps by the force of argument) over
ju&s;tice and humanity. But do you not expect to work at Belze|bub's
&s;ugar plantations in the infernal regions, under the tender go|vernment
of a negro-driver? I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e both my Lady and
Mi&s;s Firth very angry with you.</P>
<P>As to the bill for prints, which has been too long neglected,
why will you not exerci&s;e the power, which I have never revoked,
over all my ca&s;h at the Go&s;lings? The Severy family has pa&s;&s;ed a
very favourable winter; the young man is impatient to hear from a
family which he places above all others: yet he will generou&s;ly write
next week, and &s;end you a drawing of the alterations in the hou&s;e.
Do not rai&s;e your ideas; you know <HI>I</HI> am &s;atisfied with convenience
in architecture, and &s;ome elegance in furniture. I admire the cool|ne&s;s
with which you a&s;k me to epi&s;tolize Reynell and Elm&s;ley, as if
a letter were &s;o ea&s;y and plea&s;ant a ta&s;k; it appears le&s;s &s;o to me
every day.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="237">
1790.</P>
<P>YOUR indignation will melt into pity, when you hear that for
&s;everal weeks pa&s;t I have been again confined to my chamber and my
chair. Yet I mu&s;t ha&s;ten, generou&s;ly ha&s;ten, to exculpate the gout,
my old enemy, from the cur&s;es which you already pour on his head.
He is not the cau&s;e of this di&s;order, although the con&s;equences have
been &s;omewhat &s;imilar. I am &s;atisfied that this effort of nature has
&s;aved me from a very dangerous, perhaps a fatal, cri&s;is; and I li&s;ten
to the flattering hope that it may tend to keep the gout at a more
re&s;pectful di&s;tance, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The whole &s;heet has been filled with dry &s;elfi&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s; but I
mu&s;t and will re&s;erve &s;ome lines of the cover for a little friendly con|ver&s;ation.
I pa&s;&s;ed four days at the ca&s;tle of Copet with Necker; and
could have wi&s;hed to have &s;hewn him, as a warning to any a&s;piring
youth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the daemon of ambition. With all the means
of private happine&s;s in his power, he is the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of human
beings: the pa&s;t, the pre&s;ent, and the future are equally odious to
him. When I &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome dome&s;tic amu&s;ements of books, build|ing,
&amp;c. he an&s;wered, with a deep tone of de&s;pair, <Q>Dans l'&ecirc;tat ou
je &s;uis, je ne puis &s;entir que le coup de vent qui m'a abbat&ucirc;.</Q>
How different from the carele&s;s cheerfulne&s;s with which our poor
friend Lord North &s;upported his fall! Madame Necker maintains
more external compo&s;ure, <HI>mais le Diable n'y perd rien.</HI> It is true
that Necker wi&s;hed to be carried into the clo&s;et, like old Pitt, on the
&s;houlders of the people; and that he has been ruined by the demo|cracy
which he had rai&s;ed. I believe him to be an able financier, and
know him to be an hone&s;t man; too hone&s;t, perhaps, for a mini&s;ter.
His rival Calonne has pa&s;&s;ed through Lau&s;anne, in his way from
Turin; and was &s;oon followed by the Prince of Cond&eacute;, with his &s;on
and grand&s;on; but I was too much indi&s;po&s;ed to &s;ee them. They
have, or have had, &s;ome wild projects of a counter-revolution:
hor&s;es have been bought, men levied: &s;uch fooli&s;h attempts mu&s;t
<PB N="214" REF="238">
end in the ruin of the party. Burke's book is a mo&s;t admirable me|dicine
again&s;t the French di&s;ea&s;e, which has made too much progre&s;s
even in this happy country. I admire his eloquence, I approve his
politics, I adore his chivalry, and I can forgive even his &s;uper&s;tition.
The primitive church, which I have treated with &s;ome freedom, was
it&s;elf at that time an innovation, and I was attached to the old Pagan
e&s;tabli&s;hment. The French &s;pread &s;o many lies about the &s;entiments
of the Engli&s;h nation, that I wi&s;h the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men of all
parties and de&s;criptions would join in &s;ome public act, declaring
them&s;elves &s;atisfied and re&s;olved to &s;upport our pre&s;ent con&s;titution.
Such a declaration would have a wonderful effect in Europe; and,
were I thought worthy, I my&s;elf would be proud to &s;ub&s;cribe it.
I have a great mind to &s;end you &s;omething of a &s;ketch, &s;uch as all
thinking men might adopt.</P>
<P>I have intelligence of the approach of my Madeira. I accept with
equal plea&s;ure the &s;econd pipe, now in the Torrid Zone. Send me
&s;ome plea&s;ant details of your dome&s;tic &s;tate, of Maria, &amp;c. If my

<P>I ANSWER at once your two letters; and I &s;hould probably have
taken earlier notice of the fir&s;t, had I not been in daily expectation
of the &s;econd. I mu&s;t begin on the &s;ubject of what really intere&s;ts
me the mo&s;t, your glorious election for Bri&s;tol. Mo&s;t &s;incerely do I
congratulate your exchange of a cur&s;ed expen&s;ive jilt, who de&s;erted
you for a rich Jew, for an honourable connection with a cha&s;te and
virtuous matron, who will probably be as con&s;tant as &s;he is di&s;in|tere&s;ted.
In the whole range of election from Caithne&s;s to St. Ives,
I much doubt whether there be a &s;ingle choice &s;o truly honourable
to the member and the con&s;tituents. The &s;econd commercial city
invites, from a di&s;tant province, an independent gentleman, known
<PB N="215" REF="239">
only by his active &s;pirit, and his writings on the &s;ubject of trade;
and names him, without intrigue or expence, for her repre&s;entative:
even the voice of party is &s;ilenced, while factions &s;trive which &s;hall
applaud the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>You are now &s;ure, for &s;even years to come, of never wanting food;
I mean bu&s;ine&s;s: what a crowd of &s;uitors or complainants will be|&s;iege
your door! what a load of letters and memorials will be heaped
on your table! I much que&s;tion whether even you will not &s;ome|times
exclaim, <HI>Ohe! jam &s;atis e&s;t!</HI> but that is your affair. Of the
excur&s;ion to Coventry I cannot decide, but I hear it is pretty gene|rally
blamed: but, however, I love gratitude to an old friend; and
&s;hall not be very angry if you damned them with a farewel to all
eternity. But I cannot repre&s;s my indignation at the u&s;e of tho&s;e
fooli&s;h, ob&s;olete, odious words, Whig and Tory. In the American
war they might have &s;ome meaning; and then your Lord&s;hip was a
Tory, although you &s;uppo&s;ed your&s;elf a Whig: &s;ince the coalition,
all general principles have been confounded; and if there ever was
an oppo&s;ition to men, not mea&s;ures, it is the pre&s;ent. Luckily both
the leaders are great men; and, whatever happens, the country mu&s;t
fall upon its legs. What a &s;trange mi&s;t of peace and war &s;eems to
hang over the ocean! We can perceive nothing but &s;ecrecy and
vigor; but tho&s;e are excellent qualities to perceive in a mini&s;ter.
From your&s;elf and politics I now return to my private concerns,
which I &s;hall methodically con&s;ider under the three great articles of
mind, body, and e&s;tate.</P>
<P>1. I am not ab&s;olutely di&s;plea&s;ed at your firing &s;o ha&s;tily at the
hint, a tremendous hint, in my la&s;t letter. But the danger is not &s;o
&s;erious or imminent as you &s;eem to &s;u&s;pect; and I give you my
word, that, before I take the &s;lighte&s;t &s;tep which can bind me either
in law, con&s;cience, or honour, I will faithfully communicate, and
we will freely di&s;cu&s;s, the whole &s;tate of the bu&s;ine&s;s. But at pre|&s;ent
there is not any thing to communicate or di&s;cu&s;s; I do a&s;&s;ure you
<PB N="216" REF="240">
that I have not any particular object in view: I am not in love with
any of the hyaenas of Lau&s;anne, though there are &s;ome who keep
their claws tolerably well pared. Sometimes, in a &s;olitary mood, I
have fancied my&s;elf married to one or another of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ociety
and conver&s;ation are the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to me; but when I have
painted in my fancy all the probable con&s;equences of &s;uch an union,
I have &s;tarted from my dream, rejoiced in my e&s;cape, and ejaculated
a thank&s;giving that I was &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my natural freedom.
Yet I feel, and &s;hall continue to feel, that dome&s;tic &s;olitude, how|ever
it may be alleviated by the world, by &s;tudy, and even by friend|&s;hip,
is a comfortle&s;s &s;tate, which will grow more painful as I de|&s;cend
in the vale of years. At pre&s;ent my &s;ituation is very tolerable;
and if at dinner-time, or at my return home in the evening, I &s;ome|times
&s;igh for a companion, there are many hours, and many occa|&s;ions,
in which I enjoy the &s;uperior ble&s;&s;ing of being &s;ole ma&s;ter of
my own hou&s;e. But your plan, though le&s;s dangerous, is &s;till more
ab&s;urd than mine: &s;uch a couple as you de&s;cribe could not be found;
and, if found, would not an&s;wer my purpo&s;e; their rank and po&s;ition
would be awkward and ambiguous to my&s;elf and my acquaintance;
and the agreement of three per&s;ons of three characters would be &s;till
more impracticable. My plan of Charlotte Porten is undoubtedly the
mo&s;t de&s;irable; and &s;he might either remain a &s;pin&s;ter (the ca&s;e is not
without example), or marry &s;ome Swi&s;s of my choice, who would
increa&s;e and enliven our &s;ociety; and both would have the &s;tronge&s;t
motives for kind and dutiful behaviour. But the mother has been
indirectly &s;ounded, and will not hear of &s;uch a propo&s;al for &s;ome
years. On my &s;ide, I would not take her, but as a piece of &s;oft
wax which I could model to the language and manners of the
country: I mu&s;t therefore be patient.</P>
<P>Young Severy's letter, which may be now in your hands, and
which, for the&s;e three or four la&s;t po&s;ts, has furni&s;hed my indolence
with a new pretence for delay, has already informed you of the
<PB N="217" REF="241">
means and circum&s;tances of my re&s;urrection. Tedious indeed was
my confinement, &s;ince I was not able to move from my hou&s;e or
chair, from the ninth of February to the fir&s;t of July, very nearly five
months. The fir&s;t weeks were accompanied with more pain than I
have ever known in the gout, with anxious days and &s;leeple&s;s nights;
and when that pain &s;ub&s;ided, it left a weakne&s;s in my knees which
&s;eemed to have no end. My confinement was however &s;oftened by
books, by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every comfort and convenience, by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
each evening of agreeable company, and by a flow of equal
&s;pirits and general good health. During the la&s;t weeks I de&s;cended
to the ground floor, poor Deyverdun's apartment, and con&s;tructed a
chair like Merlin's, in which I could wheel my&s;elf in the hou&s;e and
on the terrace. My patience has been univer&s;ally admired; yet how
many thou&s;ands have pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e five months le&s;s ea&s;ily than my|&s;elf.
I remember making a remark perfectly &s;imple, and perfectly
true: <Q>At pre&s;ent, (I &s;aid to Madame de Severy,) I am not po&s;i|tively
mi&s;erable, and I may rea&s;onably hope a daily or weekly im|provement,
till &s;ooner or later in the &s;ummer I &s;hall recover new
limbs, and new plea&s;ures, which I do not now po&s;&s;e&s;s: have any
of you &s;uch a pro&s;pect?</Q> The prediction has been accompli&s;hed,
and I have arrived to my pre&s;ent condition of &s;trength, or rather of
feeblene&s;s: I now can walk with tolerable ea&s;e in my garden and
&s;mooth places; but on the rough pavement of the town I u&s;e, and
perhaps &s;hall u&s;e, a &s;edan chair. The Pyrmont waters have per|formed
wonders; and my phy&s;ician (not Ti&s;&s;ot, but a very &s;en&s;ible
man) allows me to hope, that the term of the interval will be in
proportion to that of the fit.</P>
<P>Have you read in the Engli&s;h papers, that the government of
Berne is overturned, and that we are divided into three democratical
leagues? true as what I have read in the French papers, that the
Engli&s;h have cut off Pitt's head, and aboli&s;hed the Hou&s;e of Lords.
The people of this country are happy; and in &s;pite of &s;ome mi&s;|creants,
<PB N="218" REF="242">
and more foreign emi&s;&s;aries, they are &s;en&s;ible of their hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Finally&mdash;Inform my Lady, that I am indignant at a fal&s;e and here|tical
a&s;&s;ertion in her la&s;t letter to Severy, <Q>that friends at a di&s;tance
cannot love each other, if they do not write.</Q> I love her better
than any woman in the world; indeed I do; and yet I do not write.
And &s;he her&s;elf&mdash;but I am calm. We have now nearly one hundred
French exiles, &s;ome of them worth being acquainted with; par|ticularly
a Count de Schomberg, who is become almo&s;t my friend;
he is a man of the world, of letters, and of &s;ufficient age, &s;ince in
1753 he &s;ucceeded to Mar&s;hal Saxe's regiment of dragoons. As to
the re&s;t, I entertain them, and they flatter me: but I wi&s;h we were
reduced to our Lau&s;anne &s;ociety. Poor France! the &s;tate is di&s;&s;olved,
the nation is mad! Adieu.</P>

<P>FIRST, of my health: it is now tolerably re&s;tored, my legs are &s;till
weak, but the animal in general is in a &s;ound and lively condition; and
we have great hopes from the fine weather and the Pyrmont waters.
I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;hed for the pre&s;ence of Maria, to embelli&s;h a ball
which I gave the 29th of la&s;t month to all the be&s;t company, natives
and foreigners, of Lau&s;anne, with the aid of the Severys, e&s;pecially of
the mother and &s;on, who directed the oeconomy, and performed the ho|nours
of the <HI>f&ecirc;te.</HI> It opened about &s;even in the evening; the a&s;&s;embly
of men and women was plea&s;ed and plea&s;ing, the mu&s;ic good, the illu|mination
&s;plendid, the refre&s;hments profu&s;e: at twelve, one hundred
and thirty per&s;ons &s;at down to a very good &s;upper: at two, I &s;tole away
to bed, in a &s;nug corner; and I was informed at breakfa&s;t, that the
remains of the veteran and young troops, with Severy and his &s;i&s;ter
at their head, had concluded the la&s;t dance about a quarter before
&s;even. This magnificent entertainment has gained me great credit;
and the expence was more rea&s;onable than you can ea&s;ily imagine.
<PB N="219" REF="243">
This was an extraordinary event, but I give frequent dinners; and
in the &s;ummer I have an a&s;&s;embly every Sunday evening. What a
wicked wretch! &s;ays my Lady.</P>
<P>I cannot pity you for the accumulation of bu&s;ine&s;s, as you ought not
to pity <HI>me,</HI> if I complained of the tranquillity of Lau&s;anne; we &s;uffer or
enjoy the effects of our own choice. Perhaps you will mutter &s;ome|thing,
of our not being born for our&s;elves, of public &s;pirit (I have for|merly
read of &s;uch a thing), of private friend&s;hip, for which I give you
full and ample credit, &amp;c. But your parliamentary operations, at
lea&s;t, will probably expire in the month of June; and I &s;hall refu&s;e to
&s;ign the Newhaven conveyance, unle&s;s I am &s;atisfied that you will
execute the Lau&s;anne vi&s;it this &s;ummer. On the 15th of June, &s;up|po&s;e
Lord, Lady, Maria, and maid, (poor Loui&s;a!) in a po&s;t coach,
with Elienne on hor&s;eback, &s;et out from Downing-Street, or Sheffield-Place,
cro&s;s the channel from Brighton to Dieppe, vi&s;it the National
A&s;&s;embly, buy caps at Paris, examine the ruins of Ver&s;ailles, and arrive
at Lau&s;anne, without danger or fatigue, the &s;econd week in July; you
will be lodged plea&s;antly and comfortably, and will not perhaps
de&s;pi&s;e my &s;ituation. A couple of months will roll, alas! too ha&s;tily
away: you will all be amu&s;ed by new &s;cenes, new people; and
whenever Maria and you, with Severy, mount on hor&s;eback to vi&s;it
the country, the glaciers, &amp;c. my Lady and my&s;elf &s;hall form a very
quiet t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te at home. In September, if you are tired, you may
return by a direct or indirect way; but I only de&s;ire that you will not
make the plan impracticable, by gra&s;ping at too much. In return, I
promi&s;e you a vi&s;it of three or four months in the autumn of ninety-two:
you and my book&s;ellers are now my principal attractions in
England. You had &s;ome right to growl at hearing of my &s;upple|ment

which I had thrown out in a letter, and which in all probability will
never be executed. Yet I am not totally idle. Adieu.</P>

I therefore &s;igned them with my eyes &s;hut, and in that

<P>AT length I &s;ee a ray of &s;un&s;hine breaking from a dark cloud.
Your epi&s;tle of the 13th arrived this morning, the 25th in&s;tant, the
day after my return from Geneva; it has been communicated to
Severy. We now believe that you intend a vi&s;it to Lau&s;anne this
&s;ummer, and we hope that you will execute that intention. If you
are a man of honour, you &s;hall find me one; and, on the day of
<PB N="221" REF="245">
your arrival at Lau&s;anne, I will ratify my engagement of vi&s;iting the
Briti&s;h i&s;le before the end of the year 1792, excepting only the fair
and foul exception of the gout. You rejoice me, by propo&s;ing the
addition of dear Loui&s;a; it was not without a bitter pang that I
threw her overboard, to lighten the ve&s;&s;el and &s;ecure the voyage: I
was fearful of the governe&s;s, a &s;econd carriage, and a long train of
difficulty and expence, which might have ended in blowing up the
whole &s;cheme. But if you can bodkin the &s;weet creature into the
coach, &s;he will find an ea&s;y welcome at Lau&s;anne. The fir&s;t arrange|ments
which I mu&s;t make before your arrival, may be altered by
your own ta&s;te, on a &s;urvey of the premi&s;es, and you will all be com|modiou&s;ly
and plea&s;antly lodged. You have heard a great deal of
the beauty of my hou&s;e, garden, and &s;ituation; but &s;uch are their
intrin&s;ic value, that, unle&s;s I am much deceived, they will bear the
te&s;t even of exaggerated prai&s;e. From my knowledge of your Lord|ship,
I have always entertained some doubt how you would get
through the &s;ociety of a Lau&s;anne winter: but I am &s;atisfied that,
exclu&s;ive of friend&s;hip, your &s;ummer vi&s;its to the banks of the Leman
Lake will long be remembered as one of the mo&s;t agreeable periods
of your life; and that you will &s;carcely regret the amu&s;ement of a
Su&s;&s;ex Committee of Navigation in the dog days. You a&s;k for de|tails:
what details? a map of France and a po&s;t-book are ea&s;y and
infallible guides. If the ladies are not afraid of the ocean, you are
not ignorant of the pa&s;&s;age from Brighton to Dieppe: Paris will then
be in your direct road; and even allowing you to look at the Pan|daemonium,
the ruins of Ver&s;ailles, &amp;c. a fortnight diligently em|ployed
will clear you from Sheffield Place to Gibbon Ca&s;tle. What
can I &s;ay more?</P>
<P>As little have I to &s;ay on the &s;ubject of my worldly matters, which
&s;eem now, Jupiter be prai&s;ed, to be drawing towards a final conclu|&s;ion;
&s;ince when people part with their money, they are indeed
&s;erious. I do not perfectly under&s;tand the ratio of the preci&s;e &s;um
<PB N="222" REF="246">
which you have poured into Go&s;ling's re&s;ervoir, but &s;uppo&s;e it will
be explained in a general account.</P>
<P>You have been very dutiful in &s;ending me, what I have always
de&s;ired, a cut Woodfall on a remarkable debate; a debate, indeed,
mo&s;t remarkable! Poor * * * * * is the mo&s;t eloquent and rational mad|man
that I ever knew. I love * * *'s feelings, but I dete&s;t the poli|tical
principles of the man, and of the party. Formerly, you dete&s;ted
them more &s;trongly during the American war, than my&s;elf. I am
half afraid that you are corrupted by your unfortunate connections.
Should you admire the National A&s;&s;embly, we &s;hall have many an
altercation, for I am as high an ari&s;tocrat as Burke him&s;elf; and he
has truly ob&s;erved, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to debate with temper on the
&s;ubject of that cur&s;ed revolution. In my la&s;t excur&s;ion to Geneva
I frequently &s;aw the Neckers, who by this time are returned to their
&s;ummer re&s;idence at Copet. He is much re&s;tored in health and
&s;pirits, e&s;pecially &s;ince the publication of his la&s;t book, which has
probably reached England. Both parties, who agree in abu&s;ing him,
agree likewi&s;e that he is a man of virtue and genius; but I much fear
that the pure&s;t intentions have been productive of the mo&s;t baneful
con&s;equences. Our military men, I mean the French, are leaving
us every day for the camp of the Princes at Worms, and &s;upport
what is called repre&s;entation. Their hopes are &s;anguine;
I will not an&s;wer for their being well grounded: it is <HI>certain,</HI> how|ever,
that the emperor had an interview the 19th in&s;tant with the
Count of Artois at Mantua; and the ari&s;tocrats talk in my&s;terious
language of Spain, Sardinia, the Empire, four or five armies, &amp;c.
They will doubtle&s;s &s;trike a blow this &s;ummer: may it not recoil on
their own heads! Adieu. Embrace our female travellers. A &s;hort

I have not any thing particular to add, excepting that our impatience
is increa&s;ed in the <HI>inver&s;e ratio</HI> of time and &s;pace. Yet I almo&s;t
doubt whether you have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ea. The news of the King of
France's e&s;cape mu&s;t have reached you before the 28th, the day of
your departure, and the pro&s;pect of &s;trange unknown di&s;order may
well have &s;u&s;pended your firme&s;t re&s;olves. The royal animal is
again caught, and all may probably be quiet. I was ju&s;t going to
exhort you to pa&s;s through Bru&s;&s;els and the confines of Germany;
a fair Iri&s;hi&s;m, &s;ince if you read this, you are already at Paris.
The only rea&s;onable advice which now remains, is to obtain, by
means of Lord Gower, a &s;ufficiency, or even &s;uperfluity, of forcible
pa&s;&s;ports, &s;uch as leave no room for cavil on a jealous frontier. The
frequent intercour&s;e with Paris has proved that the be&s;t and &s;horte&s;t
road, in&s;tead of Be&s;an&ccedil;on, is by Dijon, Dole, Les Rou&s;&s;es, and
Nyon. Adieu. I warmly embrace the Ladies. It would be idle
now to talk of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<PB N="225" REF="249">
<P>IT has appeared from the foregoing Letters, that a vi&s;it from
my&s;elf and my family, to Mr. Gibbon at Lau&s;anne, had been for
&s;ome time in agitation. This long-promi&s;ed excur&s;ion took place
in the month of June 1791, and occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable ce&s;&s;a|tion
of our corre&s;pondence. I landed at Dieppe immediately after
the flight from, and return to, Paris of the unfortunate Lewis XVI.
During my &s;tay in that capital, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing the
extraordinary ferment of men's minds, both in the national a&s;&s;embly,
in private &s;ocieties, and in my pa&s;&s;age through France to Lau&s;anne,
where I recalled to my memory the intere&s;ting &s;cenes I had wit|ne&s;&s;ed,
by frequent conver&s;ations with my decea&s;ed friend. I might
have wi&s;hed to record his opinions on the &s;ubject of the French re|volution,
if he had not expre&s;&s;ed them &s;o well in the annexed Letters.
He &s;eemed to &s;uppo&s;e, as &s;ome of his Letters hint, that I had a ten|dency
to the new French opinions. Never indeed, I can with truth
aver, was &s;u&s;picion more unfounded; nor could it have been ad|mitted
into Mr. Gibbon's mind, but that his extreme friend&s;hip for
me, and his utter abhorrence of the&s;e notions, made him anxious
and jealous, even to an exce&s;s, that I &s;hould not entertain them. He
was, however, &s;oon undeceived; he found that I was full as aver&s;e
to them as him&s;elf. I had from the fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed an opinion, that
&s;uch a change as was aimed at in France, mu&s;t derange all the regular
governments in Europe, hazard the internal quiet and deare&s;t in|tere&s;ts
of this country, and probably end in bringing on mankind
a much greater portion of mi&s;ery, than the mo&s;t &s;anguine reformer
<PB N="226" REF="250">
had ever promi&s;ed to him&s;elf or others to produce of benefit, by the
vi&s;ionary &s;chemes of liberty and equality, with which the ignorant
and vulgar were mi&s;led and abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon at fir&s;t, like many others, &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the pro|&s;pect
of the reform of inveterate abu&s;es; but he very &s;oon di&s;covered
the mi&s;chief which was intended, the imbecility with which con|ce&s;&s;ions
were made, and the ruin that mu&s;t ari&s;e, from the want of re|&s;olution
or conduct, in the admini&s;tration of France. He lived to
reprobate, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible, the folly of the fir&s;t re|formers,
and the &s;omething wor&s;e than extravagance and ferocity of
their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. He &s;aw the wild and mi&s;chievous tendency of
tho&s;e pretended reformers, which, while they profe&s;&s;ed nothing but
amendment, really meant de&s;truction to all &s;ocial order; and &s;o
&s;trongly was his opinion fixed, as to the danger of ha&s;ty innovation,
that he became a warm and zealous advocate for every &s;ort of old
e&s;tabli&s;hment, which he marked in various ways, &s;ometimes rather
ludicrou&s;ly; and I recollect, in a circle where French affairs were
the topic, and &s;ome Portugue&s;e pre&s;ent, he, &s;eemingly with &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s,
argued in favour of the inqui&s;ition at Li&s;bon, and &s;aid he
would not, at the pre&s;ent moment, give up even that old e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, not be quite unintere&s;ting to the readers of the&s;e
Memoirs, to know, that I found Mr. Gibbon at Lau&s;anne in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of an excellent hou&s;e; the view from which, and from the
terrace, was &s;o uncommonly beautiful, that even his own pen would
with difficulty de&s;cribe the &s;cene which it commanded. This pro&s;pect
comprehended every thing grand and magnificent, which could be
furni&s;hed by the fine&s;t mountains among the Alps, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive
view of the Lake of Geneva, with a beautifully varied and cul|tivated
country, adorned by numerous villas, and picture&s;que build|ings,
intermixed with beautiful ma&s;&s;es of &s;tately trees. Here my
friend received us with an ho&s;pitality and kindne&s;s which I can never
<PB N="227" REF="251">
forget. The be&s;t apartments of the hou&s;e were appropriated to our
u&s;e; the choice&s;t &s;ociety of the place was &s;ought for, to enliven our
vi&s;it, and render every day of it cheerful and agreeable. It was
impo&s;&s;ible for any man to be more e&s;teemed and admired than Mr.
Gibbon was at Lau&s;anne. The preference he had given to that
place, in adopting it for a re&s;idence, rather than his own country,
was felt and acknowledged by all the inhabitants; and he may have
been &s;aid almo&s;t to have given the law to a &s;et of as willing &s;ubjects
as any man ever pre&s;ided over. In return for the deference &s;hewn
to him, he mixed, without any affectation, in all the &s;ociety, I
mean all the be&s;t &s;ociety, that Lau&s;anne afforded; he could indeed
command it, and was, perhaps, for that rea&s;on the more partial to
it; for he often declared that he liked &s;ociety more as a relaxation
from &s;tudy, than as expecting to derive from it amu&s;ement or in|&s;truction;
that to books he looked for improvement, not to living
per&s;ons. But this I con&s;idered partly as an an&s;wer to my expre&s;&s;ions
of wonder, that a man who might choo&s;e the mo&s;t various and
mo&s;t generally improved &s;ociety in the world, namely, in England,
that he &s;hould prefer the very limited circle of Lau&s;anne, which he
never de&s;erted, but for an occa&s;ional vi&s;it to M. and Madame Necker.
It mu&s;t not, however, be under&s;tood, that in chu&s;ing Lau&s;anne for his
home, he was in&s;en&s;ible to the merits of a re&s;idence in England:
he was not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an income which corre&s;ponded with his
notions of ea&s;e and comfort in his own country. In Switzerland,
his fortune was ample. To this con&s;ideration of fortune may be
added another, which al&s;o had its weight; from early youth Mr.
Gibbon had contracted a partiality for foreign ta&s;te and foreign
habits of life, which made him le&s;s a &s;tranger abroad than he
was, in &s;ome re&s;pects, in his native country. This aro&s;e, per|haps,
from having been out of England from his &s;ixteenth to
his twenty-fir&s;t year; yet, when I came to Lau&s;anne, I found
him apparently without reli&s;h for French &s;ociety. During the
<PB N="228" REF="252">
&s;tay I made with him he renewed his intercour&s;e with the prin|cipal
French who were at Lau&s;anne; of whom there happened to
be a con&s;iderable number, di&s;tingui&s;hed for rank or talents; many
indeed re&s;pectable for both<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mar&s;hal de Ca&s;tries and &s;everal branches of his family, Duc de Guignes and daughters, Duc and Duche&s;&s;e de Guiche, Madame de Grammont, Prince&s;&s;e d'Henin, Prince&s;&s;e de Bouillon, Duche&s;&s;e de Biron, Prince de Salms, Comte de Schomberg, M. Lally Tolendal, M. de Mounier, Madame d'Ague&s;&s;eau and family, M. de Mal|herbes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. During my &s;tay in Switzerland I was
not ab&s;ent from my friend's hou&s;e, except during a &s;hort excur&s;ion
that we made together to Mr. Necker's at Copet, and a tour to Geneva,
Chamouny, over the Col de Balme, to Martigny, St. Maurice, and
round the Lake by Vevay to Lau&s;anne. In the &s;ocial and &s;ingularly
plea&s;ant months that I pa&s;&s;ed with Mr. Gibbon, he enjoyed his u&s;ual
cheerfulne&s;s, with good health. Since he left England, in 1788, he
had had a &s;evere attack, mentioned in one of the foregoing letters, of
an Ery&s;ipelas, which at la&s;t &s;ettled in one of his legs, and left &s;ome|thing
of a drop&s;ical tendency; for at this time I fir&s;t perceived a
con&s;iderable degree of &s;welling about the ancle.</P>
<P>In the beginning of October I left this delightful re&s;idence; and
&s;ome time after my return to England, our corre&s;pondence recom|menced.</P>

<P>I remember to have read &s;omewhere in Rou&s;&s;eau, of a lover quit|ting
very often his mi&s;tre&s;s, to have the plea&s;ure of corre&s;ponding
with her. Though not ab&s;olutely your lover, I am very much
your admirer, and &s;hould be extremely tempted to follow the &s;ame
example. The &s;pirit and rea&s;on which prevail in your conver&s;ation,
appear to great advantage in your letters. The three which I have
<PB N="203" REF="254">
received from Berne, Coblentz, and Bru&s;&s;els have given me much
real plea&s;ure; fir&s;t, as a proof that you are often thinking of me;
&s;econdly, as an evidence that you are capable of keeping a re&s;olu|tion;
and thirdly, from their own intrin&s;ic merit and entertainment.
The &s;tyle, without any allowance for ha&s;te or hurry, is perfectly
correct; the manner is neither too light, nor too grave; the dimen|&s;ions
neither too long, nor too &s;hort: they are &s;uch, in a word, as I
&s;hould like to receive from the daughter of my be&s;t friend. I attend
your lively journal, through bad roads, and wor&s;e inns. Your de|&s;cription
of men and manners conveys very &s;atisfactory information;
and I am particularly delighted with your remark concerning the
irregular behaviour of the Rhine. But the Rhine, alas! after &s;ome
temporary wanderings, will be content to flow in his old channel,
while man&mdash;man is the greate&s;t fool of the whole creation.</P>
<P>I direct this letter to Sheffield-Place, where I &s;uppo&s;e you arrived
in health and &s;afety. I congratulate my Lady on her quiet e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
by her fire&s;ide; and hope you will be able, after all your ex|cur&s;ions,
to &s;upport the climate and manners of Old England. Before
this epi&s;tle reaches you, I hope to have received the two promi&s;ed
letters from Dover and Sheffield-Place. If they &s;hould not meet
with a proper return, you will pity and forgive me. I have not yet
heard from Lord Sheffield, who &s;eems to have devolved on his
daughter, the ta&s;k which &s;he has &s;o gloriou&s;ly executed. I &s;hall pro|bably
not write to him, till I have received his fir&s;t letter of bu&s;ine&s;s
from England; but with regard to my Lady, I have mo&s;t excellent
intentions.</P>
<P>I never could under&s;tand how two per&s;ons of &s;uch &s;uperior merit,
as Mi&s;s Holroyd and Mi&s;s Lau&s;anne, could have &s;o little reli&s;h for
one another, as they appeared to have in the beginning; and it was
with great plea&s;ure that I ob&s;erved the degrees of their growing inti|macy,
and the mutual regret of their &s;eparation. Whatever you
may imagine, your friends at Lau&s;anne have been thinking as fre|quently
<PB N="231" REF="255">
of your&s;elf and company, as you could po&s;&s;ibly think of
them; and you will be very ungrateful, if you do not &s;eriou&s;ly re|&s;olve
to make them a &s;econd vi&s;it, under &s;uch name and title as you
may judge mo&s;t agreeable. None of the Severy family, except per|haps
my &s;ecretary, are inclined to forget you; and I am continually
a&s;ked for &s;ome account of your health, motions, and amu&s;ements.
Since your departure, no great events have occurred. I have made
a &s;hort excur&s;ion to Geneva and Copet, and found Mr. Necker in
much better &s;pirits than when you &s;aw him. They pre&s;&s;ed me to
pa&s;s &s;ome weeks this winter in their hou&s;e at Geneva; and I may
po&s;&s;ibly comply, at lea&s;t, in part, with their invitation. The a&s;pect of
Lau&s;anne is peaceful and placid; and you have no hopes of a revolution
driving me out of this country. We hear nothing of the proceedings
of the commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A commi&s;&s;ion, at the head of which was Mon&s;ieur Fi&s;cher, one of the principal members of the government of Berne, a very active and intelligent man, who would have di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the admini&s;tration of any country. This commi&s;&s;ion, which was accompanied by two or three thou&s;and of the be&s;t of the German militia of the Canton of Berne, was &s;ent for the purpo&s;e of examining into &s;ome attempts to in|troduce the French revolutionary principles into the Pays de Vaud. Several per&s;ons were &s;eized; the greater part were relea&s;ed; the examination was &s;ecret, but Ro&s;&s;et and La Motte were confined in the ca&s;tle of Chillon; and being afterwards condemned, for corre&s;pondence with the French, to a long impri&s;onment, were transferred to the ca&s;tle of Arbourg. S.</NOTE>, except by playing at cards every evening with
Mon&s;ieur Fi&s;cher, who often &s;peaks of Lord Sheffield with e&s;teem
and re&s;pect. There is no appearance of Ro&s;&s;et and La Motte being
brought to a &s;peedy trial, and they &s;till remain in the ca&s;tle of
Chillon, which (according to the geography of the National A&s;&s;em|bly)
is wa&s;hed by the &s;ea. Our winter begins with great &s;everity;
and we &s;hall not probably have many balls, which, as you may ima|gine,
I lament much. Angletine does not con&s;ider two French
words as a letter. Montrond &s;ighs and blu&s;hes whenever Loui&s;a's
name is mentioned: Philippine wi&s;hes to conver&s;e with her on men

and manners. The French ladies are &s;ettled in town for the winter,
and they form, with Mrs. Trevor, a very agreeable addition to our
&s;ociety. It is now enlivened by a vi&s;it of the Chevalier de Boufflers,
one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed men in the <HI>ci devant</HI> kingdom of France.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madame de Silva.</NOTE>, who has mi&s;carried, is about to leave us, I mu&s;t
either cure or die; and, upon the whole, I believe the former will be
mo&s;t expedient. You will &s;ee her in London, with dear Corea,
next winter. My rival magnificently pre&s;ents me with an hog&s;head
of Madeira; &s;o that in honour I could not &s;upplant him: yet I do
a&s;&s;ure you, from my heart, that another departure is much more
painful to me. The apartment below<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The apartment principally inhabited during the re&s;idence of my family at Lau|&s;anne. S.</NOTE> is &s;hut up, and I know not

<HEAD>EDWARD GIBBON E&s;q. to the Right Hon. Lord SHEFFIELD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>December 28, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALAS! alas! the daemon of procra&s;tination has again po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me.
Three months have nearly rolled away &s;ince your departure; and
&s;even letters, five from the mo&s;t valuable Maria, and two from your|&s;elf,
have extorted from me only a &s;ingle epi&s;tle, which perhaps
would never have been written, had I not u&s;ed the permi&s;&s;ion of em|ploying
my own tongue and the hand of a &s;ecretary. Shall I tell you,
that, for the&s;e la&s;t &s;ix weeks, the eve of every day has witne&s;&s;ed a
<HI>firm</HI> re&s;olution, and the day it&s;elf has furni&s;hed &s;ome ingenious delay?
This morning, for in&s;tance, I determined to invade you as &s;oon as
the breakfa&s;t things &s;hould be removed: they were removed; but
I had &s;omething to read, to write, to meditate, and there was time
<PB N="233" REF="257">
enough before me. Hour after hour has &s;tolen away, and I finally
begin my letter at two o'clock, evidently too late for the po&s;t, as I
mu&s;t dre&s;s, dine, go abroad, &amp;c. A foundation, however, <HI>&s;hall be</HI> laid,
which will &s;tare me in the face; and next Saturday I &s;hall probably
be rou&s;ed by the awful reflection that it is the la&s;t day in the year.</P>
<P>After realizing this &s;ummer an event which I had long con&s;idered
as a dream of fancy, I know not whether I &s;hould rejoice or grieve
at your vi&s;it to Lau&s;anne. While I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the family, the &s;enti|ment
of plea&s;ure highly predominated; when, ju&s;t as we had &s;ub|&s;ided
in a regular, ea&s;y, comfortable plan of life, the la&s;t trump
&s;ounded, and, without &s;peaking of the pang of &s;eparation, you left
me to one of the mo&s;t gloomy, &s;olitary months of October which I
have ever pa&s;&s;ed. For your&s;elf and daughters, however, you have
contrived to &s;natch &s;ome of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;cenes of this world.
Paris, at &s;uch a moment, Switzerland, and the Rhine, Stra&s;burg,
Coblentz, have &s;ugge&s;ted a train of lively images and u&s;eful ideas,
which will not be &s;peedily era&s;ed. The mind of the young dam&s;el,
more e&s;pecially, will be enlarged and enlightened in every &s;en&s;e. In
four months &s;he has lived many years; and &s;he will much deceive
and di&s;plea&s;e me, if &s;he does not review and methodize her journal,
in &s;uch a manner as &s;he is capable of performing, for the amu&s;ement
of her particular friends. Another benefit which will redound from
your recent view is, that every place, per&s;on, and object, about
Lau&s;anne, are now become familiar and intere&s;ting to you. In our
future corre&s;pondence (do I dare pronounce the word corre&s;pond|ence?)
I can talk to you as freely of every circum&s;tance as if it
were actually before your eyes. And fir&s;t, of my own improve|ments.
&mdash;All tho&s;e venerable piles of ancient verdure which you <HI>ad|mired</HI>
have been eradicated in one fatal day. Your faithful &s;ub&s;ti|tutes,
William de Severy and Levade, have never cea&s;ed to per&s;ecute
me, till I &s;igned their death warrant. Their place is now &s;upplied
<PB N="234" REF="258">
by a number of picture&s;que naked poles, the fo&s;ter-fathers of as
many twigs of Platanu&s;&s;es, which may afford a grateful but di&s;tant
&s;hade to the founder, or to his &s;eris Nepotibus. In the mean while
I mu&s;t confe&s;s that the terrace appears broader, and that I di&s;cover a
much larger quantity of &s;now than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e do. The
workmen admire your ingenious plan for cutting out a new bed|chamber
and book-room; but, on mature con&s;ideration, we all una|nimou&s;ly
prefer the old &s;cheme of adding a third room on the ter|race
beyond the library, with two &s;pacious windows, and a fire-place
between. It will be larger (28 feet by 21), and plea&s;anter, and
warmer: the difference of expence will be much le&s;s con&s;iderable
than I imagined: the door of communication with the library will
be artfully buried in the wain&s;cot; and, unle&s;s it be opened by my
own choice, may always remain a profound &s;ecret. Such is the de|&s;ign;
but, as it will not be executed before next &s;ummer, you have
time and liberty to &s;tate your objections. I am much colder about
the &s;tairca&s;e, but it may be fini&s;hed, according to your idea, for
thirty pounds; and I feel they will per&s;uade me. Am I not a very
rich man? When the&s;e alterations are completed, few authors of
&s;ix volumes in quarto will be more agreeably lodged than my&s;elf.
Lau&s;anne is now full and lively; all our native families are re|turned
from the country; and, prai&s;ed be the Lord! we are infe&s;ted
with few foreigners, either French or Engli&s;h. Even our demo|crats
are more rea&s;onable or more di&s;creet; it is agreed, to wave
the &s;ubject of politics, and all &s;eem happy and cordial. I have a
grand dinner this week, a &s;upper of thirty or forty people on
Twelfth-day, &amp;c.; &s;ome concerts have taken place, &s;ome balls are
talked of; and even Maria would allow (yet it is ungenerous to &s;ay
even Maria) that the winter &s;cene at Lau&s;anne is tolerably gay and
active. I &s;ay nothing of the Severys, as Angletine has epi&s;tolized
Maria la&s;t po&s;t. She has probably hinted that her brother meditates a
<PB N="235" REF="259">
&s;hort excur&s;ion to Turin: that worthy fellow Trevor has given him
a pre&s;&s;ing invitation to his own hou&s;e. In the beginning of Febru|ary
I propo&s;e going to Geneva for three or four weeks. I &s;hall lodge
and eat with the Neckers; my mornings will be my own, and I &s;hall
&s;pend my evenings in the &s;ociety of the place, where I have many
acquaintance. This &s;hort ab&s;ence will agitate my &s;tagnant life, and
re&s;tore me with fre&s;h appetite to my hou&s;e, my library, and my
friends. Before that time (the end of February) what events may
happen, or be ready to happen! The National A&s;&s;embly (compared
to which the former was a &s;enate of heroes and demi-gods) &s;eem re|&s;olved
to attack Germany <HI>avec quatre millions de bayonettes libres;</HI> the
army of the princes mu&s;t &s;oon either &s;ight, or &s;tarve, or conquer.
Will Sweden draw his &s;word? will Ru&s;&s;ia draw her pur&s;e? an empty
pur&s;e! All is darkne&s;s and anarchy: neither party is &s;trong enough
to oppo&s;e a &s;ettlement; and I cannot &s;ee a po&s;&s;ibility of an amicable
arrangement, where there are no heads (in any &s;en&s;e of the word)
who can an&s;wer for the multitude. Send me your ideas, and tho&s;e
of Lord Guildford, Lord Loughborough, Fox, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, a word of my vexatious affairs.&mdash;Shall I never
&s;ail on the &s;mooth &s;tream of good &s;ecurity and half-yearly intere&s;t?
will every body refu&s;e my money? I had already written to Darrel
and Go&s;ling to obey your commands, and was in hopes that you
had already made large and &s;alutary evacuations. During your ab|&s;ence
I never expected much effect from the cold indifference of
agents; but you are now in England&mdash;you will be &s;peedily in Lon|don:
&s;et all your &s;etting-dogs to beat the field, hunt, enquire, why
&s;hould you not adverti&s;e? Yet I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to complain of
&s;ome &s;tagnation of intere&s;t, when I am witne&s;s to the natural and
acquired philo&s;ophy of &s;o many French, who are reduced from
riches, not to indigence, but to ab&s;olute want and beggary. A
Count Argout has ju&s;t left us, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ten thou&s;and a-year in
<PB N="236" REF="260">
the i&s;land of St. Domingo; he is utterly burnt and ruined; and a
brother, whom he tenderly loved, has been murdered by the negroes.
The&s;e are real misfortunes. I have much revolved the plan of the
Memoirs I once mentioned; and, as you do not think it ridiculous,
I believe I &s;hall make an attempt: if I can plea&s;e my&s;elf, I am con|fident
of not di&s;plea&s;ing; but let this be a profound &s;ecret between
us: people mu&s;t not be prepared to laugh; they mu&s;t be taken by
&s;urpri&s;e. Have you looked over your, or rather my, letters? Surely,
in the cour&s;e of the year, you may find a &s;afe and cheap occa&s;ion of
&s;ending me a parcel; they may a&s;&s;i&s;t me. Adieu. I embrace my
Lady: &s;end me a favourable account of her health. I ki&s;s the Mar|maille.
By an amazing pu&s;h of remor&s;e and diligence I have
fini&s;hed my letter (three pages and a half) this &s;ame day &s;ince
dinner; but I have not time to read it.</P>

<P>I NOW mo&s;t &s;incerely repent of my late repentance, and do almo&s;t
&s;wear never to renounce the amiable and u&s;eful practice of pro|cra&s;tination.
Had I delayed, as I was &s;trongly tempted, another po&s;t,
your mi&s;&s;ive of the 13th, which did not reach me till this morning
(three mails were due), would have arrived in time, and I might
have avoided this &s;econd Herculean labour. It will be, however, no
more than an infant Hercules. The topics of conver&s;ation have
been fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and I &s;hall now confine my&s;elf to the needful of
the new bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>Felix fau&s;tumque &s;it!</HI> may no untoward accident
di&s;arrange your York&s;hire mortgage; the conclu&s;ion of which will
place me in a clear and ea&s;y &s;tate, &s;uch as I have never known &s;ince
the fir&s;t hour of property. * * * *</P>

The three per cents are &s;o high, and the country is in &s;uch a
damned &s;tate of pro&s;perity under that fellow Pitt, that it goes again&s;t
me to purcha&s;e at &s;uch low intere&s;t. In my vi&s;it to England next
autumn, or in the &s;pring following, (alas! you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> acquie&s;ce in
the alternative,) I hope to be armed with &s;ufficient materials to draw
a &s;um, which may be employed as ta&s;te or fancy &s;hall dictate, in
the improvement of my library, a &s;ervice of plate, &amp;c. I am not
very &s;anguine, but &s;urely this is no uncomfortable pro&s;pect. This
pecuniary detail, which has not indeed been &s;o unplea&s;ant as it u&s;ed
formerly to be, has carried me farther than I expected. Let us now
drink and be merry. I flatter my&s;elf that your Madeira, improved
by its travels, will &s;et forwards for me&s;&s;rs. Romberg, at O&s;tend, early
in the &s;pring; and I &s;hould be very well plea&s;ed if you could add a
hog&s;head of excellent Claret, for which we &s;hould be entitled to the
drawback: they mu&s;t halt at Ba&s;te, and &s;end notice to me for a &s;afe|conduct.
Have you had any intelligence from Lord Auckland about
the wine which he was to order from Bourdeaux, by Mar&s;eilles and
the Rhone? The one need not impede the other; I wi&s;h to have a
large &s;tock. Corea has promi&s;ed me a hog&s;head of his native Ma|deira,
for which I am to give him an order on Cadell for a copy of
the Decline and Fall: he vani&s;hed without notice, and is now at
Paris. Could you not fi&s;h out his direction by Mrs. Wood, who by
this time is in England? I rejoice in Lally's pro&s;perity. Have you
recon&s;idered my propo&s;al of a declaration of con&s;titutional principles
from the heads of the party? I think a fooli&s;h addre&s;s from a body
of Whigs to the National A&s;&s;embly renders it &s;till more incumbent
on you. Atchieve my worldly concerns, <HI>et eris mihi magnus Apollo.</HI>

<P>FOR fear you &s;hould abu&s;e me, as u&s;ual, I will begin the attack,
and &s;cold at you, for not having yet &s;ent me the long-expected
intelligence of the completion of my mortgage. You had po&s;itively
a&s;&s;ured me that the &s;econd of February would terminate my worldly
cares, by a con&s;ummation &s;o devoutly to be wi&s;hed. The news,
therefore, might reach me about the eighteenth; and I argued with
the gentle logic of lazine&s;s, that it was perfectly idle to an&s;wer your
letter, till I could chaunt a thank&s;giving &s;ong of gratitude and prai&s;e.
As every po&s;t di&s;appointed my hopes, the &s;ame argument was re|peated
for the next; and twenty empty-handed po&s;tilions have
blown their in&s;ignificant horns, till I am provoked at la&s;t to write
by &s;heer impatience and vexation. <HI>Facit indignatio ver&s;um. Co&s;petto
di Baccho;</HI> for I mu&s;t ea&s;e my&s;elf by &s;wearing a little. What is
the cau&s;e, the meaning, the pretence, of this delay? Are the York-&s;hire
mortgagers incon&s;tant in their wi&s;hes? Are the London lawyers
con&s;tant in their procra&s;tination? Is a letter on the road, to inform
me that all is concluded, or to tell me that all is broken to pieces?
Had the money been placed in the three per cents la&s;t May; be&s;ides
the annual intere&s;t, it would have gained by the ri&s;e of &s;tock nearly
twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> Your Lord&s;hip is a wi&s;e man, a &s;ucce&s;sful writer,
and an u&s;eful &s;enator; you under&s;tand America and Ireland, corn
and &s;laves, but your prejudice again&s;t the funds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be more correct if he had &s;aid, my preference of land. S.</NOTE>, in which I
am often tempted to join, makes you a little blind to their in|crea&s;ing
value in the hands of our virtuous and excellent mini&s;ter.
But our regret is vain; one pull more and we reach the &s;hore; and
our future corre&s;pondence will be no longer tainted with bu&s;ine&s;s.
Shall I then be more diligent and regular? I hope and believe &s;o;
for now that I have got over this article of worldly intere&s;t, my letter
<PB N="239" REF="263">
&s;eems to be almo&s;t fini&s;hed. <HI>A propos</HI> of letters, am I not a &s;ad
dog to forget my Lady and Maria? Alas! the dual number has
been prejudicial to both. How happy could I be with either, were
t'other dear charmer away. I am like the a&s;s of famous memory;
I cannot tell which way to turn fir&s;t, and there I &s;tand mute and
immoveable. The Baronial and maternal dignity of my Lady, &s;up|ported
by twenty years friend&s;hip, may claim the preference. But
the &s;ive incomparable letters of Maria!&mdash;Next week, however.&mdash;
Am I not a&s;hamed to talk of next week?</P>
<P>I have mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully, and mo&s;t agreeably, executed my plan of
&s;pending the month of March at Geneva, in the Necker-hou&s;e, and
every circum&s;tance that I had arranged turned out beyond my ex|pectation;
the freedom of the morning, the &s;ociety of the table and
drawing-room, from half an hour pa&s;t two till &s;ix or &s;even; an even|ing
a&s;&s;embly and card-party, in a round of the be&s;t company, and,
excepting one day in the week, a private &s;upper of free and friendly
conver&s;ation. You would like Geneva better than Lau&s;anne; there
is much more information to be got among the men; but though I
found &s;ome agreeable women, their manners and &s;tile of life are,
upon the whole, le&s;s ea&s;y and plea&s;ant than our own. I was much
plea&s;ed with Necker's brother Mr. De Germain, a good-humoured,
polite, &s;en&s;ible man, without the genius and fame of the &s;tate&s;man,
but much more adapted for private and ordinary happine&s;s. Ma|dame
de Stael is expected in a few weeks at Copet, where they re|ceive
her, and where, <Q>the plea&s;ing anxious being,</Q> &s;he will
have lei&s;ure to regret <Q>to dumb forgetfulne&s;s a prey,</Q> which &s;he en|joyed
amid&s;t the &s;torms of Paris. But what can the poor creature
do? her hu&s;band is in Sweden, her lover is no longer &s;ecretary at war,
and her father's hou&s;e is the only place where &s;he can re&s;ide with the
lea&s;t degree of prudence and decency. Of that father I have really a
much higher idea than I ever had before; in our dome&s;tic intimacy
he ca&s;t away his gloom and re&s;erve; I &s;aw a great deal of his mind,
<PB N="240" REF="264">
and all that I &s;aw is fair and worthy. He was overwhelmed by the
hurricane, he mi&s;took his way in the fog, but in &s;uch a perilous
&s;ituation, I much doubt whether any mortal could have &s;een or
&s;tood. In the meanwhile, he is abu&s;ed by all parties, and none of
the French in Geneva will &s;et their foot in his hou&s;e. He remem|bers
Lord Sheffield with e&s;teem; his health is good, and he would
be tranquil in his private life, were not his &s;pirits continually
wounded by the arrival of every letter and every new&s;paper. His
&s;ympathy is deeply intere&s;ted by the fatal con&s;equences of a revo|lution,
in which he had acted &s;o leading a part; and he feels as a
friend for the danger of M. de Le&s;&s;art, who may be guilty in the
eyes of the Jacobius, or even of his judges, by tho&s;e very actions
and di&s;patches which would be mo&s;t approved by all the lovers of
his country. What a momentous event is the Emperor's death!
In the forms of a new reign, and of the Imperial election, the demo|crats
have at lea&s;t gained time, if they knew how to u&s;e it. But the
new monarch, though of a weak complexion, is of a martial temper;
he loves the &s;oldiers, and is beloved by them; and the &s;low fluctu|ating
politics of his uncle may be &s;ucceeded by a direct line of
march to the gates of Stra&s;bourg and Paris. It is the opinion of the
ma&s;ter movers in France, (I know it mo&s;t certainly,) that their troops
will not fight, that the people have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of patrioti&s;m, and
that on the fir&s;t di&s;charge of an Au&s;trian cannon the game is up.
But what occa&s;ion for Au&s;trians or Spaniards? the French are them|&s;elves
their greate&s;t enemies; four thou&s;and Mar&s;eillois are marched
again&s;t Arles and Avignon, the <HI>troupes de ligne</HI> are divided between
the two parties, and the flame of civil war will &s;oon extend over the
&s;outhern provinces. You have heard of the unworthy treatment
of the Swi&s;s regiment of Ern&s;t. The canton of Berne has bravely
recalled them, with a &s;tout letter to the King of France, which mu&s;t
be in&s;erted in all the papers. I now come to the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant
article, our home politics. Bo&s;&s;et and La Motte are condemned to
<PB N="241" REF="265">
fine and twenty years impri&s;onment in the fortre&s;s of Arbourg. We
have not yet received their official &s;entence, nor is it believed that
the proofs and proceedings again&s;t them will be publi&s;hed; an auk|ward
circum&s;tance, which it does not &s;eem ea&s;y to ju&s;tify. Some
(though none of note) are taken up, &s;everal are fled, many more are
&s;u&s;pected and &s;u&s;picious. All are &s;ilent, but it is the &s;ilence of fear
and di&s;content; and the &s;ecret hatred which rankled again&s;t go|vernment
begins to point again&s;t the few who are known to be well-affected.
I never knew any place &s;o much changed as Lau&s;anne,
even &s;ince la&s;t year; and though you will not be much obliged to
me for the motive, I begin very &s;eriou&s;ly to think of vi&s;iting Shef|field-Place
by the month of September next. Yet here again I am
frightened, by the dangers of a French, and the difficulties of a
German, route. You mu&s;t &s;end me an account of the pa&s;&s;age from
Dieppe to Brighton, with an itinerary of the Rhine, di&s;tances, ex|pences,
&amp;c. As u&s;ual, I ju&s;t &s;ave the po&s;t, nor have I time to read
my letter, which, after wa&s;ting the morning in deliberation, has
been &s;truck off in a heat &s;ince dinner. No news of the Madeira.
Your views of S. P. are ju&s;t received; they are admired, and &s;hall be
framed. Severy has &s;pent the carnival at Turin. Trevor is only
the be&s;t man in the world.</P>

<P>AFTER the receipt of your <HI>penultimate,</HI> eight days ago, I expected,
with much impatience, the arrival of your next-promi&s;ed epi&s;tle.
It arrived this morning, but has not completely an&s;wered my ex|pectations.
I wanted, and I hoped for a full and fair picture of the
pre&s;ent and probable a&s;pect of your political world, with which, at
this di&s;tance, I &s;eem every day le&s;s &s;atisfied. In the &s;lave que&s;tion
you triumphed la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, in this you have been defeated. What
<PB N="242" REF="266">
is the cau&s;e of this alteration? If it proceeded only from an impul&s;e
of humanity, I cannot be di&s;plea&s;ed, even with an error; &s;ince it is
very likely that my own vote (had I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one) would have
been added to the majority. But in this rage again&s;t &s;lavery, in the
numerous petitions again&s;t the &s;lave trade, was there no leaven of
new democratical principles? no wild ideas of the rights and natural
equality of man? It is the&s;e, I fear. Some articles in new&s;papers,
&s;ome pamphlets of the year, the Jockey Club, have fallen into my
hands. I do not infer much from &s;uch publications; yet I have
never known them of &s;o black and malignant a ca&s;t. I &s;huddered at
Grey's motion; di&s;liked the half-&s;upport of Fox, admired the firm|ne&s;s
of Pitt's declaration, and excu&s;ed the u&s;ual intemperance of Burke.
Surely &s;uch men as * * *, * * * *, * * * *, * * * *, * * *, have talents for mi&s;|chief.
I &s;ee a club of reform which contains &s;ome re&s;pectable names.
Inform me of the profe&s;&s;ions, the principles, the plans, the re&s;ources, of
the&s;e reformers. Will they heat the minds of the people? Does the
French democracy gain no ground? Will the bulk of your party &s;tand
firm to their own intere&s;t, and that of their country? Will you not
take &s;ome active mea&s;ures to declare your &s;ound opinions, and &s;e|parate
your&s;elves from your rotten members? If you allow them
to perplex government, if you trifle with this &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;s, if
you do not re&s;i&s;t the &s;pirit of innovation in the fir&s;t attempt, if you
admit the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t &s;pecious change in our parliamentary
&s;y&s;tem, you are lo&s;t. You will be driven from one &s;tep to another;
from principles ju&s;t in theory, to con&s;equences mo&s;t pernicious in
practice; and your fir&s;t conce&s;&s;ions will be productive of every &s;ub|&s;equent
mi&s;chief, for which you will be an&s;werable to your country
and to po&s;terity. Do not &s;uffer your&s;elves to be lulled into a fal&s;e
&s;ecurity; remember the proud fabric of the French monarchy. Not
four years ago it &s;tood founded, as it might &s;eem, on the rock of
time, force, and opinion, &s;upported by the triple ari&s;tocracy of the
church, the nobility, and the parliaments. They are crumbled into
<PB N="243" REF="267">
du&s;t; they are vani&s;hed from the earth. If this tremendous warning
has no effect on the men of property in England; if it does not
open every eye, and rai&s;e every arm, you will de&s;erve your fate.
If I am too precipitate, enlighten; if I am too de&s;ponding, en|courage
me.</P>
<P>My pen has run into this argument; for, as much a foreigner
as you think me, on this momentous &s;ubject, I feel my&s;elf an Eng|li&s;hman.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of re&s;iding at Sheffield-Place is, after all, the fir&s;t
and the ultimate object of my vi&s;it to my native country. But when
or how will that vi&s;it be effected? Clouds and whirlwinds, Au&s;trian
Croats and Gallic cannibals, &s;eem one very &s;ide to impede my pa&s;&s;age.
You &s;eem to apprehend the perils or dfficulties of the German road,
and French peace is more &s;anguinary than civilized war. I mu&s;t
pa&s;s through, perhaps, a thou&s;and republics or municipalities, which
neither obey nor are obeyed. The &s;trictne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ports, and the
popular ferment, are much increa&s;ed &s;ince la&s;t &s;ummer: ari&s;tocrate
is in every mouth, lanterns hang in every &s;treet, and an ha&s;ty word,
or a ca&s;ual re&s;emblance, may be fatal. Yet, on the other hand, it
is probable that many Engli&s;h, men, women, and children, will
traver&s;e the country without any accident before next September;
and I am &s;en&s;ible that many things appear more formidable at a di&s;|tance
than on a nearer approach. Without any ab&s;olute determina|tion,
we mu&s;t &s;ee what the events of the next three or four months
will produce. In the mean while, I &s;hall expect with impatience
your next letter: let it be &s;peedy; my an&s;wer &s;hall be prompt.</P>
<P>You will be glad, or &s;orry, to learn that my gloomy apprehen&s;ions
are much abated, and that my departure, whenever it takes place,
will be an act of choice, rather than of nece&s;&s;ity. I do not pretend
to affirm, that &s;ecret di&s;content, dark &s;u&s;picion, private animo&s;ity,
are very materially a&s;&s;uaged; but we have not experienced, nor do
we now apprehend, any dangerous acts of violence, which may
<PB N="244" REF="268">
compel me to &s;eek a refuge among the friendly Bears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Berne.</NOTE>, and to aban|don
my library to the mercy of the democrats. The firmne&s;s and
vigour of government have cru&s;hed, at lea&s;t for a time, the &s;pirit of in|novation;
and I do not believe that the body of the people, e&s;pecially
the pea&s;ants, are di&s;po&s;ed for a revolution. From France, prai&s;ed be
the demon of anarchy! the in&s;urgents of the Pays de Vaud could
not at pre&s;ent have much to hope; and &s;hould the <HI>gardes nationales,</HI>
of which there is little appearance, attempt an incur&s;ion, the country
is armed and prepared, and they would be re&s;i&s;ted with equal num|bers
and &s;uperior di&s;cipline. The Gallic wolves that prowled round
Geneva are drawn away, &s;ome to the &s;outh and &s;ome to the north,
and the late events in Flanders &s;eem to have diffu&s;ed a general con|tempt,
as well as abhorrence, for the lawle&s;s &s;avages, who fly before
the enemy, hang their pri&s;oners, and murder their officers. The
brave and patient regiment of Erne&s;t is expected home every day,
and as Berne will take them into pre&s;ent pay, that veteran and re|gular
corps will add to the &s;ecurity of our frontier.</P>
<P>I rejoice that we have &s;o little to &s;ay on the &s;ubject of worldly
affairs. * * * * This &s;ummer we are threatened with an inundation,
be&s;ides many namele&s;s Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h; but I am anxious for the
Duche&s;s of Devon&s;hire and the Lady Elizabeth Fo&s;ter, who are on
their march. Lord Malm&s;bury, the <HI>audacieux</HI> Harris, will inform
you that he has &s;een me: <HI>him</HI> I would have con&s;ented to keep.</P>
<P>One word more before we part; call upon Mr. John Nicholls,
book&s;eller and printer, at Cicero's Head, Red-Lion-Pa&s;&s;age, Fleet-Street,
and a&s;k him whether he did not, about the beginning of
March, receive a very polite letter from Mr. Gibbon of Lau&s;anne?
To which, either as a man of bu&s;ine&s;s or a civil gentleman, he
&s;hould have returned an an&s;wer. My application related to a
dome&s;tic article in the Gentleman's Magazine of Augu&s;t 1788,

&s;ervice to me; the work appears far more difficult in the execution
than in the idea, and as I am now taking my leave for &s;ome time
of the library, I &s;hall not make much progre&s;s in the memoirs of P. P.
till I am on Engli&s;h ground. But is it indeed true, that I &s;hall eat
any Su&s;&s;ex phea&s;ants this autumn? The event is in the book of
Fate, and I cannot unroll the leaves of September and October.
Should I reach Sheffield-Place, I hope to find the whole family in a
perfect &s;tate of exi&s;tence, except a certain Maria Holroyd, my fair
and <HI>generous</HI> corre&s;pondent, who&s;e annihilation on proper terms I
mo&s;t fervently de&s;ire. I mu&s;t receive a copious an&s;wer before the

<P>WHEN I inform you, that the de&s;ign of my Engli&s;h expedition is
at la&s;t po&s;tponed till another year, you will not be much &s;urpri&s;ed.
The public ob&s;tacles, the danger of one road, and the difficulties of
another, would alone be &s;ufficient to arre&s;t &s;o unwieldy and inactive a
being; and the&s;e ob&s;tacles, on the &s;ide of France, are growing every
day more in&s;uperable. On the other hand, the terrors which might
have driven me from hence have, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;ub&s;ided; our
&s;tate-pri&s;oners are forgotten: the country begins to recover its old
good humour and un&s;u&s;pecting confidence, and the la&s;t revolution

of Paris appears to have convinced almo&s;t every body of the fatal
con&s;equences of democratical principles, which lead by a path of
flowers into the aby&s;s of hell. I may therefore wait with patience
and tranquillity till the Duke of Brun&s;wick &s;hall have opened the
French road. But if I am not driven from Lau&s;anne, you will a&s;k,
I hope with &s;ome indignation, whether I am not drawn to England,

and yours is now the &s;tronge&s;t, and mu&s;t gradually become the &s;ole,
inducement that can force me from my library and garden, over

would almo&s;t begin to think me on the road. How dreadfully, &s;ince
my la&s;t date, has the French road been polluted with blood! and
what horrid &s;cenes may be acting at this moment, and may &s;till be
aggravated, till the Duke of Brun&s;wick is ma&s;ter of Paris! On every
rational principle of calculation he mu&s;t &s;ucceed; yet &s;ometimes,
when my &s;pirits are low, I dread the blind efforts of mad and de|&s;perate
multitudes fighting on their own ground. A few days or
weeks mu&s;t decide the military operations of this year, and perhaps
for ever; but on the faire&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, I cannot look forwards to
any firm &s;ettlement, either of a legal or an ab&s;olute government. I
cannot pretend to give you any Paris news. Should I inform you,
as we believe, that <HI>Lally is &s;till among the cannibals,</HI> you would po&s;|&s;ibly

Madame de Stael, after miraculou&s;ly e&s;caping through pikes and
poignards, has reached the ca&s;tle of Copet, where I &s;hall &s;ee her be|fore
the end of the week. If any thing can provoke the King of
Sardinia and the Swi&s;s, it mu&s;t be the foul de&s;truction of <HI>his</HI> cou&s;in
Madame de Lamballe, and of <HI>their</HI> regiment of guards. An extra|ordinary
council is &s;ummoned at Berne, <HI>but re&s;entment may be checked
by prudence.</HI> In &s;pite of Maria's laughter, I applaud your modera|tion,
and &s;igh for a hearty union of all the &s;en&s;e and property of
the country. The times require it; but your la&s;t political letter was
a cordial to my &s;pirits. The Duche&s;s of D. rather di&s;likes a coa|lition:
amiable creature! The Eliza (we call her Be&s;s) is furious
again&s;t you for not writing. We &s;hall lo&s;e them in a few days; but
the motions of Be&s;s and the Duche&s;s for Italy or England, are doubt|ful.
Ladies Spencer and Duncannon certainly pa&s;s the Alps. I live
with them. Adieu. Since I do not appear in per&s;on, I feel the ab|&s;olute
propriety of writing to my Lady and Maria; but there is far
from the knowledge to the performance of a duty. Ever your's.</P>

<P>AS our Engli&s;h new&s;papers mu&s;t have informed you of the inva|&s;ion
of Savoy by the French, and as it is po&s;&s;ible that you may
have &s;ome trifling apprehen&s;ions of my <HI>being killed and eaten by tho&s;e
cannibals,</HI> it has appeared to me that a &s;hort extraordinary di&s;patch
might not be unacceptable on this occa&s;ion. It is indeed true, that
about ten days ago the French army of the South, under the com|mand
of M. de Monte&s;quieu, (if any French army can be &s;aid to be
under any command,) has entered Savoy, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves
of Chamberry, Montmelian, and &s;everal other places. It has always
been the practice of the king of Sardinia to abandon his tran&s;alpine
<PB N="248" REF="272">
dominions; but on this occa&s;ion the court of Turin appears to have
been &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;trange excentric motions of a democracy,
which always acts from the pa&s;&s;ion of the moment; and their infe|rior
troops have retreated, with &s;ome lo&s;s and di&s;grace, into the pa&s;&s;es
of the Alps. Mount Cenis is now impervious, and our Engli&s;h tra|vellers
who are bound for Italy, the Duche&s;s of Devon&s;hire, An|ca&s;ter,
&amp;c. will be forced to explore a long circuitous road through
the Tirol. But the Chablais is yet intact, nor can our tele&s;copes di&s;|cover
the tricolor banners on the other &s;ide of the lake. Our ac|counts
of the French numbers &s;eem to vary from fifteen to thirty
thou&s;and men; the regulars are few, but they are followed by a
rabble rout, which mu&s;t &s;oon, however, melt away, as they will find
no plunder, and &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, in the poverty and barrenne&s;s of
Savoy. <HI>N. B.</HI> I have ju&s;t &s;een a letter from Mr. de Monte&s;quieu,
who boa&s;ts that at his fir&s;t entrance into Savoy he had only twelve
battalions. Our intelligence is far from correct.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates of Geneva were alarmed by this dangerous neigh|bourhood,
and more e&s;pecially by the well-known animo&s;ity of an
exiled citizen, Claviere, who is one of the &s;ix mini&s;ters of the
French republic. It was carried by a &s;mall majority in the General
Council, to call in the &s;uccour of three thou&s;and Swi&s;s, which is &s;ti|pulated
by antient treaty. The &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on or pretence of the
minority, was founded on the danger of provoking the French, and
they &s;eem to have been ju&s;tified by the event; &s;ince the complaint
of the French re&s;ident amounts to a declaration of war. The forti|fications
of Geneva are not contemptible, e&s;pecially on the &s;ide of
Savoy; and it is much doubted whether Mr. de Monte&s;quieu is pre|pared
for a regular &s;iege; but the malecontents are numerous within
the walls, and I que&s;tion whether the &s;pirit of the citizens will hold
out again&s;t a bombardment. In the mean while the diet has declared
that the fir&s;t cannon fired again&s;t Geneva will be con&s;idered as an act
of ho&s;tility again&s;t the whole Helvetic body. Berne, as the neare&s;t
and mo&s;t powerful canton, has taken the lead with great vigour and
<PB N="249" REF="273">
vigilance; the road is filled with the perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of troops
and artillery; and, if &s;ome di&s;affection lurks in the towns, the
pea&s;ants, e&s;pecially the Germans, are inflamed with a &s;trong de&s;ire
of encountering the murderers of their countrymen. Mr. de Watte|ville,
with whom you dined at my hou&s;e la&s;t year, refu&s;ed to accept
the command of the Swi&s;s &s;uccour of Geneva, till it was made his
fir&s;t in&s;truction that he &s;hould never, in any ca&s;e, &s;urrender him&s;elf
pri&s;oner of war.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, you may &s;uppo&s;e that we have &s;ome fears. I
have great dependence, however, on the many chances in our
favour, the valour of the Swi&s;s, the return of the Piedmonte&s;e with
their Au&s;trian allies, eight or ten thou&s;and men from the Milane&s;e,
a diver&s;ion from Spain, the great events (how &s;lowly they proceed)
on the &s;ide of Paris, the incon&s;tancy and want of di&s;cipline of the
French, and the near approach of the winter &s;ea&s;on. I am not
nervous, but I will not be ra&s;h. It will be painful to abandon my
hou&s;e and library; but, if the danger &s;hould approach, I will retreat
before it, fir&s;t to Berne, and gradually to the North. Should I even
be forced to take refuge in England (a violent mea&s;ure &s;o late in the
year), you would perhaps receive me as kindly as you do the French
prie&s;ts&mdash;a noble act of ho&s;pitality! Could I have fore&s;een this
&s;torm, I would have been there &s;ix weeks ago; but who can fore&s;ee
the wild mea&s;ures of the &s;avages of Gaul? We thought our&s;elves
perfectly out of the hurricane latitudes. Adieu. I am going to bed,
and mu&s;t ri&s;e early to vi&s;it the Neckers at Rolle, whither they have
retired, from the frontier &s;ituation of Copet. Severy is on hor&s;eback,
with his dragoons: his poor father is dangerou&s;ly ill. It will be &s;hock|ing
if it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary to remove him. While we are
in this very awkward cri&s;is, I will write at lea&s;t every week. Ever

<P>Since my la&s;t of the 6th, our attack is not more eminent, and our
defence is mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly &s;tronger, two very important circum&s;tances,
at a time when every day is leading us, though not &s;o fa&s;t as our im|patience
could wi&s;h, towards the unwarlike month of November; and
we ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure that the troops of Mr. de Monte&s;quieu,
which are chiefly from the Southern Provinces, will not cheerfully
entertain the rigor of an Alpine winter. The 7th in&s;tant, Mr. de
Chateauneuf, the French re&s;ident, took his leave with an haughty
mandate, commanding the Genevois, as they valued their &s;afety and
the friend&s;hip of the republic, to di&s;mi&s;s their Swi&s;s allies, and to
puni&s;h the magi&s;trates who had traiterou&s;ly propo&s;ed the calling in
the&s;e foreign troops. It is preci&s;ely the fable of the wolves, who
offered to make peace with the &s;heep, provided they would &s;end
away their dogs. You know what became of the &s;heep. This de|mand
appears to have kindled a ju&s;t and general indignation, &s;ince it
announced an edict of pro&s;cription; and mu&s;t lead to a democratical
revolution, which would probably renew the horrid &s;cenes of Paris
and Avignon. A general a&s;&s;embly of the citizens was convened, the
me&s;&s;age was read, &s;peeches were made, oaths were taken, and it was
re&s;olved (with only three di&s;&s;entient voices) to live and die in the
defence of their country. The Genevois mu&s;ter above three thou|&s;and
well-armed citizens; and the Swi&s;s, who may ea&s;ily be in|crea&s;ed
(in a few hours) to an equal number, add &s;pirit to the timo|rous,
<PB N="251" REF="275">
and confidence to the well-affected: their ar&s;enals are filled
with arms, their magazines with ammunition, and their granaries
with corn. But their fortifications are exten&s;ive and imperfect, they
are commanded from two adjacent hills; a French faction lurks in
the city, the character of the Genevois is rather commercial than
military, and their behaviour, lofty promi&s;e, and ba&s;e &s;urrender, in
the year 1782, is fre&s;h in our memories. In the mean while, 4000
French at the mo&s;t are arrived in the neighbouring camp, nor is
there yet any appearance of mortars or heavy artillery. Perhaps
an haughty menace may be repelled by a firm countenance. If it
were worth while talking of ju&s;tice, what a &s;hameful attack of a
feeble, unoffending &s;tate! On the news of their danger, all Swit|zerland,
from Scha&s;&s;ou&s;e to the Pays de Vaud, has ri&s;en in arms;
and a French re&s;ident, who has pa&s;&s;ed through the country, in his
way from Rati&s;bon, declares his intention of informing and admo|ni&s;hing
the National Convention. About eleven thou&s;and Bernois
are already po&s;ted in the neighbourhood of Copet and Nyon; and
new reinforcements of men, artillery, &amp;c. arrive every day. Ano|ther
army is drawn together to oppo&s;e Mr. de Ferrieres, on the &s;ide
of Bienne and the bi&s;hopric of Ba&s;le; and the Au&s;trians in Swabia
would be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to cro&s;s the Rhine in our defence. But
we are yet ignorant whether our &s;overeigns mean to wage an
offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive war. If the latter, which is more likely, will
the French begin the attack? Should Genoa yield to fear or force,
this country is open to an inva&s;ion; and though our men are brave,
we want generals; and I de&s;pi&s;e the French much le&s;s than I did two
months ago. It &s;hould &s;eem that our hopes from the King of Sar|dinia
and the Au&s;trians of Milan are faint and di&s;tant; Spain &s;leeps;
and the Duke of Brun&s;wick (amazement!) &s;eems to have failed in his
great project. For my part, till Geneva falls, I do not think of a
retreat; but, at all events, I am provided with two &s;trong hor&s;es, and
an hundred Louis in gold. Zurich would be probably my winter quar|ters,
<PB N="252" REF="276">
and the &s;ociety of the Neckers would make any place agreeable.
Their &s;ituation is wor&s;e than mine: I have no daughter ready to lie
in; nor do I fear the French ari&s;tocrats on the road. Adieu. Keep
my letters; excu&s;e contradictions and repetitions. The Duche&s;s of

<P>SINCE my la&s;t, our affairs take a more pacific turn; but I will not
venture to affirm that our peace will be either &s;afe or honourable.
Mr. de Monte&s;quieu and three commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention,
who are at Carrouge, have had frequent conferences with the magi&s;|trates
of Geneva; &s;everal expre&s;&s;es have been di&s;patched to and from
Paris, and every &s;tep of the negotiation is communicated to the de|puties
of Berne and Zurich. The French troops ob&s;erve a very
tolerable degree of order and di&s;cipline; and no act of ho&s;tility has
yet been committed on the territory of Geneva.</P>

<P>My u&s;ual temper very readily admitted the excu&s;e, that it would
be better to wait another week, till the final &s;ettlement of our affairs.
The treaty is &s;igned between France and Geneva; and the ratifica|tion
of the Convention is looked upon as a&s;&s;ured, if any thing can be
a&s;&s;ured in that wild democracy. On condition that the Swi&s;s garri|&s;on,
with the approbation of Berne and Zurich, be recalled before
the fir&s;t of December, it is &s;tipulated that the independence of Ge|neva
&s;hall be pre&s;erved inviolate; that Mr. de Monte&s;quieu &s;hall im|mediately
&s;end away his heavy artillery; and that no French troops
&s;hall approach within ten leagues of the city. As the Swi&s;s have
acted only as auxiliaries, they have no occa&s;ion for a direct treaty; but
they cannot prudently di&s;arm, till they are &s;atisfied of the pacific
<PB N="253" REF="277">
intentions of France; and no &s;uch &s;atisfaction can be given till they
have acknowledged the new republic, which they will probably do
in a few days, with a deep groan of indignation and &s;orrow; it has
been cemented with the blood of their countrymen! But when the
Emperour, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, the fir&s;t general, and the fir&s;t army
in Europe have failed, le&s;s powerful &s;tates may acquie&s;ce, without
di&s;honour, in the determination of fortune. Do you under&s;tand this
mo&s;t unexpected failure? I will allow an ample &s;hare to the badne&s;s
of the roads and the weather, to famine and di&s;ea&s;e, to the &s;kill of
Dumourier, a heaven-born general! and to the enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardour
of the new Romans; but &s;till, &s;till there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;ecret and
&s;hameful cau&s;e at the bottom of this &s;trange retreat. We are now
delivered from the impending terrors of &s;iege and inva&s;ion. The
Geneva <HI>emigr&eacute;s,</HI> particularly the Neckers, are ha&s;tening to their
homes; and I &s;hall not be reduced to the hard nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking a
winter a&s;ylum at Zurich or Con&s;tance: but I am not plea&s;ed with
our future pro&s;pects. It is much to be feared that the pre&s;ent govern|ment
of Geneva will be &s;oon modelled after the French fa&s;hion; the
new republic of Savoy is forming on the oppo&s;ite bank of the Lake;
the Jacobin mi&s;&s;ionaries are powerful and zealous; and the malecon|tents
of this country, who begin again to rear their heads, will be
&s;urrounded with temptations, and examples, and allies. I know not
whether the Pays de Vaud will long adhere to the dominion of
Berne; or whether I &s;hall be permitted to end my days in this little
paradi&s;e, which I have &s;o happily &s;uited to my ta&s;te and circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>La&s;t Monday only I received your letter, which had &s;trangely
loitered on the road &s;ince its date of the 29th of September. There
mu&s;t &s;urely be &s;ome di&s;order in the po&s;ts, &s;ince the Eliza departed
indignant at never having heard from you.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of my wine I think peculiarly hard: to lo&s;e my Madeira,
and to be &s;colded for lo&s;ing it. I am much indebted to Mr. Nichols for
<PB N="254" REF="278">
his genealogical communications, which I am impatient to receive;
but I do not under&s;tand why &s;o civil a gentleman could not favour
me, in &s;ix months, with an an&s;wer by the po&s;t: &s;ince he entru&s;ts me
with the&s;e valuable papers, you have not, I pre&s;ume, informed him
of my negligence and awkwardne&s;s in regard to manu&s;cripts. Your
reproach rather &s;urpri&s;es me, as I &s;uppo&s;e I am much the &s;ame as I
have been for the&s;e la&s;t twenty years. Should you hold your re&s;olu|tion
of writing only &s;uch things as may be publi&s;hed at Charing-Cro&s;s,
our future corre&s;pondence would not be very intere&s;ting. But
I expect and require, at this important cri&s;is, a full and confidential
account of your views concerning England, Ireland, and France.
You have a &s;trong and clear eye; and your pen is, perhaps, the mo&s;t
u&s;eful quill that ever has been plucked from a goo&s;e. Your protec|tion
of the French re&s;ugees is highly applauded. Ro&s;&s;et and La

di&s;agreeable demands from the republic. Adieu. Ever yours.</P>

<P>RECEIVED this day, November 9th, a mo&s;t amiable di&s;patch
from the too humble &s;ecretary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;s Holroyd.</NOTE> of the family of E&s;pee<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Meaning Sheffield-Place.</NOTE>, dated
October 24th, which I an&s;wer the &s;ame day. It will be acknow|ledged,
that I have fulfilled my engagements with as much accuracy
as our uncertain &s;tate and the fragility of human nature would allow.
I re&s;ume my narrative. At the time when we imagined that all was
&s;ettled, by an equal treaty between two &s;uch unequal powers, as the
Geneva Flea and the Leviathan France, we were thunder&s;truck with
the intelligence that the mini&s;ters of the republic refu&s;ed to ratify the
conditions; and they were indignant, with &s;ome colour of rea&s;on, at
<PB N="255" REF="279">
the hard obligation of withdrawing their troops to the di&s;tance of
ten leagues, and of con&s;equently leaving the Pays de Gez naked,
and expo&s;ed to the Swi&s;s, who had a&s;&s;embled 15,000 men on the
frontier, and with whom they had not made any agreement. The
me&s;&s;enger who was &s;ent la&s;t Sunday from Geneva is not yet re|turned;
and many per&s;ons are afraid of &s;ome de&s;ign and danger in
this delay. Monte&s;quieu has acted with politene&s;s, moderation, and
apparent &s;incerity; but he may re&s;ign, he may be &s;uper&s;eded, his
place may be occupied by an <HI>enrag&eacute;,</HI> by Servan, or Prince Charles
of He&s;&s;e, who would a&s;pire to imitate the predatory fame of Cu&s;tine
in Germany. In the mean while, the General holds a wolf by the
ears; an officer who has &s;een his troops, about 18,000 men (with a
tremendous train of artillery), repre&s;ents them as a black, daring, de&s;|perate
crew of buccaneers, rather &s;hocking than contemptible; the
officers (&s;carcely a gentleman among them), without &s;ervants, or
hor&s;es, or baggage, lying <HI>higgledy piggledy</HI> on the ground with the
common men, yet maintaining a rough kind of di&s;cipline over them.
They already begin to accu&s;e and even to &s;u&s;pect their general, and
call aloud for blood and plunder: could they have an opportunity of
&s;queezing &s;ome of the rich citizens, Geneva would cut up as &s;at as
mo&s;t towns in Europe. During this &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities they are
permitted to vi&s;it the city without arms, &s;ometimes three or four
hundred at a time; and the magi&s;trates, as well as the Swi&s;s com|mander,
are by no means plea&s;ed with this dangerous intercour&s;e,
which they dare not prohibit. Such are our fears: yet it &s;hould &s;eem
on the other &s;ide, that the French affect a kind of magnanimous ju&s;tice
towards their little neighbour, and that they are not ambitious of an
unprofitable conte&s;t with the poor and hardy Swi&s;s. The Swi&s;s are
not equal to a long and expen&s;ive war; and as mo&s;t of our militia
have families and trades, the country already &s;ighs for their return.
Whatever can be yielded, without ab&s;olute danger or di&s;grace, will
<PB N="256" REF="280">
doubtle&s;s be granted; and the bu&s;ine&s;s will probably end in our owning
the &s;overeignty, and tru&s;ting to the good faith of the republic of France:
how that word would have &s;ounded four years ago! The mea&s;ure
is humiliating; but after the retreat of the Duke of Brun&s;wick, and
the failure of the Au&s;trians, the &s;maller powers may acquie&s;ce with|out
di&s;honour. Every dog has his day; and the&s;e Gallic dogs have
their day, at lea&s;t, of mo&s;t in&s;olent pro&s;perity. After forcing or
tempting the Pru&s;&s;ians to evacuate their country, they conquer Sa|voy,
pillage Germany, threaten Spain: the Low Countries are ere
now invaded; Rome and Italy tremble; they &s;cour the Mediterra|nean,
and talk of &s;ending a &s;quadron into the South Sea. The whole
horizon is &s;o black, that I begin to feel &s;ome anxiety for England,
the la&s;t refuge of liberty and law; and the more &s;o, as I perceive
from Lord Sheffield's la&s;t epi&s;tle that his firm nerves are a little &s;haken:
but of this more in my next, for I want to unburthen my con&s;cience.
If England, with the experience of our happine&s;s and French calami|ties,
&s;hould now be &s;educed to eat the apple of fal&s;e freedom, we
&s;hould indeed de&s;erve to be driven from the paradi&s;e which we
enjoy. I turn a&s;ide from the horrid and improbable (yet not impo&s;|&s;ible)
&s;uppo&s;ition, that, in three or four years' time, my&s;elf and my
be&s;t friends may be reduced to the deplorable &s;tate of the French
emigrants: they thought it as impo&s;&s;ible three or four years ago.
Never did a revolution affect, to &s;uch a degree, the private exi&s;tence
of &s;uch numbers of the fir&s;t people of a great country: your ex|amples
of mi&s;ery I could ea&s;ily match with &s;imilar examples in this
country and the neighbourhood; and our &s;ympathy is the deeper,
as we do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, like you, the means of alleviating, in &s;ome
degree, the misfortunes of the fugitives. But I mu&s;t have, from the
very excellent pen of the Maria, the tragedy of the Archbi&s;hop of
Arles; and the longer the better. Madame de Biron has probably
been tempted by &s;ome faint and (I fear) fallacious promi&s;es of cle|mency
<PB N="257" REF="281">
to the women, and which have likewi&s;e engaged Madame
d'Ague&s;&s;eau and her two daughters to revi&s;it France. Madame de
Bouillon &s;tands her ground, and her &s;ituation as a foreign prince&s;s is
le&s;s expo&s;ed. As Lord S. has a&s;&s;umed the glorious character of pro|tector
of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, his name is pronounced with gratitude and
re&s;pect. The D. of Richmond is prai&s;ed, on Madame de Biron's
account. To the Prince&s;s d'Henin, and Lally, I wi&s;h to be remem|bered.
The Neckers cannot venture into Geneva, and Madame de
Stael will probably lie in at Rolle. He is printing a defence of the
King, &amp;c. again&s;t their republican Judges; but the name of Necker
is unpopular to all parties, and I much fear that the guillotine will
be more &s;peedy than the pre&s;s. It will, however, be an eloquent

<P>The revolution of France, and my triple di&s;patch by the
&s;ame po&s;t to Sheffield-Place, are, in my opinion, the two mo&s;t
&s;ingular events in the eighteenth century. I found the ta&s;k &s;o
ea&s;y and plea&s;ant, that I had &s;ome thoughts of adding a letter
to the gentle Loui&s;a. I am this moment informed, that our
troops on the frontier are beginning to move, on their
return home; yet we hear nothing of the treaty's being con|cluded.</P>

<P>IN di&s;patching the weekly political journal to Lord S. my con|&s;cience
(for I have &s;ome remains of con&s;cience) mo&s;t powerfully
urges me to &s;alute, with &s;ome lines of friend&s;hip and gratitude, the
amiable &s;ecretary, who might &s;ave her&s;elf the trouble of a mode&s;t
apology. I have not yet forgotten our different behaviour after the
much lamented <HI>&s;eparation</HI> of October the 4th, 1791, your meritori|ous
punctuality, and my unworthy &s;ilence. I have &s;till before me
that entertaining narrative, which would have intere&s;ted me, not only
in the progre&s;s of the <HI>cari&s;&s;ima familia,</HI> but in the motions of a
Tartar camp, or the march of a caravan of Arabs; the mixture of
ju&s;t ob&s;ervation and lively imagery, the &s;trong &s;en&s;e of a man, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
with the ea&s;y elegance of a female. I &s;till recollect with
plea&s;ure the happy compari&s;on of the Rhine, who had heard &s;o much
of liberty on both his banks, that he wandered with mi&s;chievous
licentiou&s;ne&s;s over all the adjacent meadows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gibbon alludes to letters written to him by Mi&s;s Holroyd, when &s;he was returning from Switzerland, along the Rhine, to England. S.</NOTE>. The inundation,
alas! has now &s;pread much wider; and it is &s;adly to be feared that
the Elbe, the Po, and the Danube, may imitate the vile example of
the Rhine: I &s;hall be content, however, if our own Thames &s;till
pre&s;erves his fair character, of</P>
<Q>Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.</Q>
<P>The&s;e agreeable epi&s;tles of Maria produced only &s;ome dumb in|tentions,
and &s;ome barren remor&s;e; nor have I de&s;igned, except by
a brief mi&s;&s;ive from my chancellor, to expre&s;s how much I loved
the author, and how much I was plea&s;ed with the compo&s;ition.
That amiable author I have known and loved from the fir&s;t dawning
of her life and <HI>coquetry,</HI> to the pre&s;ent maturity of her talents; and as
<PB N="259" REF="283">
long as I remain on this planet, I &s;hall pur&s;ue, with the &s;ame tender
and even anxious concern, the future &s;teps of her e&s;tabli&s;hment and
life. That e&s;tabli&s;hment mu&s;t be &s;plendid; that life mu&s;t be happy.
She is endowed with every gift of nature and fortune; but the ad|vantage
which &s;he will derive from them, depends almo&s;t entirely on
her&s;elf. You mu&s;t not, you &s;hall not, think your&s;elf unworthy to
write to any man: there is none whom your corre&s;pondence would
not amu&s;e and &s;atisfy. I will not undertake a ta&s;k, which my ta&s;te
would adopt, and my indolence would too &s;oon relinqui&s;h; but I
am really curious, from the be&s;t motives, to have a particular account
of your own &s;tudies and daily occupation. What books do you read?
and how do you employ your time and your pen? Except &s;ome
profe&s;&s;ed &s;cholars, I have often ob&s;erved that women in general read
much more than men; but, for want of a plan, a method, a fixed
object, their reading is of little benefit to them&s;elves, or others. If
you will inform me of the &s;pecies of reading to which you have the
mo&s;t propen&s;ity, I &s;hall be happy to contribute my &s;hare of advice or
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I lament that you have not left me &s;ome monument of
your pencil. Lady Elizabeth Fo&s;ter has executed a very pretty
drawing, taken from the door of the green-hou&s;e where we dined
la&s;t &s;ummer, and including the poor Acacia (now recovered from the
cruel &s;heers of the gardener), the end of the terrace, the front of the
Pavilion, and a di&s;tant view of the country, lake, and mountains. I
am almo&s;t reconciled to d'Apples' hou&s;e, which is nearly fini&s;hed.
In&s;tead of the mon&s;ters which Lord Hercules Sheffield extirpated,
the terrace is already &s;haded with the new acacias and plantanes; and
although the uncertainty of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion re&s;trains me from building, I
my&s;elf have planted a bo&s;quet at the bottom of the garden, with &s;uch
admirable &s;kill that it affords &s;hade without intercepting pro&s;pect.
The &s;ociety of the afore&s;aid Eliza, commonly called Be&s;s, of the
Duche&s;s of D. &amp;c. has been very intere&s;ting; but they are now flown
beyond the Alps, and pa&s;s the winter at Pi&s;a. The Legards, who
<PB N="260" REF="284">
have long &s;ince left this place, &s;hould be at pre&s;ent in Italy; but I
believe Mrs. Grim&s;tone and her daughter returned to England. The
Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ades are highly flattered by your remembrance. Since you &s;till
retain &s;ome attachment to this delightful country, and it is indeed
delightful, why &s;hould you de&s;pair of &s;eeing it once more? The
happy peer or commoner, who&s;e name you may a&s;&s;ume, is &s;till con|cealed
in the book of fate; but, who&s;oever he may be, he will cheer|fully
obey your commands, of leading you from&mdash;Ca&s;tle to
Lau&s;anne, and from Lau&s;anne to Rome and Naples. Before that
this event takes place, I may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee you in Su&s;&s;ex; and,
whether as a vi&s;itor or a fugitive, I hope to be welcomed with a
friendly embrace. The delay of this year was truly painful, but it
was inevitable; and individuals mu&s;t &s;ubmit to tho&s;e &s;torms which
have overturned the thrones of the earth. The tragic &s;tory of the
Archbi&s;hop of Arles I have now &s;omewhat a better right to require
at your hands. I wi&s;h to have it in all its horrid details<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The An&s;wer to Mr. Gibbon's Letter is annexed, as giving the be&s;t account I have &s;een of the barbarous tran&s;action alluded to. S.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>SHEFFIELD-PLACE,&punc; <DATE>November 1791.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR three letters received ye&s;terday cau&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;incere plea&s;ure to each individual of this family; to none more than my&s;elf. Prai&s;e, (I fear, beyond my de&s;erts,) from one who&s;e opinion I &s;o highly value, and who&s;e e&s;teem I &s;o much wi&s;h to pre&s;erve, is more plea&s;ing than I can de&s;cribe. I had not neglected to make the collection of facts which you recommend, and which the great variety of unfortunate per&s;ons whom we &s;ee, or with whom we corre&s;pond, enables me to make.</P>
<P>As to that part of your letter which re&s;pects <HI>my &s;tudies,</HI> I can only &s;ay, the &s;lighte&s;t hint on that &s;ubject is always received with the greate&s;t gratitude, and attended to with the utmo&s;t punctuality; but I mu&s;t decline that topic for the pre&s;ent, to obey your commands, which require from me the horrid account of the <HI>ma&s;&s;acre aux Carmes.</HI>&mdash;Eight re&s;pectable eccle&s;ia&s;tics landed, about the beginning of October, from an open boat at Seaford, wet as the waves. The natives of the coa&s;t were endeavouring to get from them what they had not, (viz.) money, when a gentle|man of the neighbourhood came to their protection; and, finding they had nothing, &s;hewed his good &s;en&s;e, by di&s;patching them to Milord Sheffield: they had been pillaged, and with great difficulty had e&s;caped from Paris. The reception they met with at this hou&s;e, &s;eemed to make the greate&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on them; they were in extacy on finding M. de Lally living: they gradually became cheerful, and en|joyed their dinner: they were greatly affected as they recollected them&s;elves, and found us attending on them. Having dined, and drank a gla&s;s of wine, they began to di&s;cover the beauties of the dining-room, and of the chateau: as they walked about, they were overheard to expre&s;s their admiration at the treatment they met, and <HI>from Prote&s;tants.</HI> We then a&s;&s;embled in the library, formed half a circle round the fire, M. de Lally and Milord occupying the hearth <HI>&agrave; l'Angloi&s;e,</HI> and que&s;tioning the prie&s;ts concerning their e&s;cape. Thus we di&s;covered, that two of the&s;e unfor|tunate men were in the Carmelite Convent at the time of the ma&s;&s;acre of the one hundred and twenty prie&s;ts, and had mo&s;t miraculou&s;ly e&s;caped, by climbing trees in the garden, and from thence over the tops of the buildings. One of them, a man of &s;uperior appearance, de&s;cribed, in the mo&s;t pathetic manner, the death of the Archbi&s;hop of Arles, (and with &s;uch &s;implicity and feeling, as to leave no doubt of the truth of all that he &s;aid,) to the following purport.&mdash;On the &s;econd of Sep|tember, about five o'clock in the evening, at the time they were permitted to walk in the garden, expecting every hour to be relea&s;ed, they expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing &s;everal large pits, which had been digging for two days pa&s;t: they &s;aid, the day is almo&s;t &s;pent; and yet Manuel told a per&s;on who interceded for us la&s;t Thur&s;|day, that on the Sunday following not one &s;hould remain in captivity: we are &s;till pri&s;oners: &s;oon after, they heard &s;houts, and &s;ome mu&s;quet-&s;hots. An en&s;ign of the national guard, &s;ome commi&s;&s;aries of the &s;ections, and &s;ome Mar&s;eillois ru&s;hed in: the mi&s;erable victims, who were di&s;per&s;ed in the garden, a&s;&s;embled under the walls of the church, not daring to go in, le&s;t it &s;hould be polluted with blood. One man, who was behind the re&s;t, was &s;hot. "<HI>Point de coup de fu&s;ils,</HI>" cried one of the chiefs of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, thinking that kind of death too ea&s;y. The&s;e well-trained fu&s;ileers went to the rear; les piques, les haches, les poignards came forward. They demanded the Archbi&s;hop of Arles; he was immediately &s;urrounded by all the prie&s;ts. The worthy prelate &s;aid to his friends, <Q>Let me pa&s;s; if my blood will appea&s;e them, what &s;ignifies it, if I die? Is it not my duty to pre&s;erve your lives at the expence of my own?</Q> He a&s;ked the elde&s;t of the prie&s;ts to give him ab&s;olution: he knelt to receive it; and when he aro&s;e, forced him&s;elf from them, advanced &s;lowly, and with his arms cro&s;&s;ed upon his brea&s;t, and his eyes rai&s;ed to heaven, &s;aid to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, "<HI>Je &s;uis celui que vous cherchez.</HI>" His appearance was &s;o dignified and noble, that, during ten minutes, not one of the&s;e wretches had cou|rage to lift his hand again&s;t him: they upbraided each other with cowardice, and advanced; one look from this venerable man &s;truck them with awe, and they re|tired. At la&s;t, one of the mi&s;creants &s;truck off the cap of the Archbi&s;hop with a pike; re&s;pect once violated, their fury returned, and another from behind cut him through the &s;kull with a &s;abre. He rai&s;ed his right hand to his eyes; with another &s;troke they cut off his hand. The Archbi&s;hop &s;aid, <HI>O! mon Dieu!</HI> and rai&s;ed the other: a third &s;troke acro&s;s the face left him &s;itting; the fourth extended him life|le&s;s on the ground; and then all pre&s;&s;ed forward, and buried their pikes and poignards in the body. The prie&s;ts all agreed, that he had been one of the mo&s;t amiable men in France; and that his only <HI>crime</HI> was, having, &s;ince the revolution, expended his private fortune, to &s;upport the nece&s;&s;itous clergy of his dioce&s;e. The &s;econd victim was the General des Benedictins. Then the national guards obliged the prie&s;ts to go into the church, telling them, they &s;hould appear, one after another, before the Commi&s;&s;aires du &s;ection. They had hardly entered, before the people impatiently called for them; upon which, all kneeling before the altar, the Bi&s;hop of Beauvais gave them ab&s;olution: they were then obliged to go out, two by two; they pa&s;&s;ed before a commi&s;&s;aire, who did not que&s;tion, but only counted, his victims; they had in their &s;ight the heaps of dead, to which they were going to add. Among the one hundred and twenty prie&s;ts thus &s;acrificed, were the Bi&s;hops of Zaintes and Beauvais (both of the Rochefoucauld family). I &s;hould not omit to remark, that one of the prie&s;ts ob&s;erved they were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, becau&s;e they would not &s;wear to a con&s;titution which their murderers had de&s;troyed. We had (to comfort us for this melancholy &s;tory) the mo&s;t grateful expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to|wards the Engli&s;h nation, from whom they did not do us the ju&s;tice to expect &s;uch a reception.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the ma&s;&s;acres was concerted at a meeting at the Duke of Orleans's hou&s;e. I &s;hall make you as di&s;mal as my&s;elf by this narration. I mu&s;t change the &s;tyle. * * * * * * * * * *</P>

are now &s;o much mingled with the French exiles, I am of opinion,
that were you to keep a journal of all the authentic facts which they

yours I &s;hould be glad to have &s;ome information of the health, &s;pirits,

<P>I COULD never forgive my&s;elf, were I capable of writing by the
&s;ame po&s;t, a political epi&s;tle to the father, and a friendly letter to
the daughter, without &s;ending any token of remembrance to the re|&s;pectable
matron, my deare&s;t my Lady, whom I have now loved as a
&s;i&s;ter for &s;omething better or wor&s;e than twenty years. No, indeed,
the hi&s;torian may be carele&s;s, he may be indolent, he may always
intend and never execute, but he is neither a mon&s;ter nor a &s;tatue;
he has a memory, a con&s;cience, a heart, and that heart is &s;incerely
devoted to Lady S&mdash;. He mu&s;t even acknowledge the fallacy of
a &s;ophi&s;m which he has &s;ometimes u&s;ed, and &s;he has always and
mo&s;t truly denied; that, where the per&s;ons of a family are &s;trictly
united, the writing to one is in fact writing to all; and that con|&s;equently
all his numerous letters to the hu&s;band, may be con&s;idered
as equally addre&s;&s;ed to his wife. He feels, on the contrary, that
&s;eparate minds have their di&s;tinct ideas and &s;entiments, and that
each character, either in &s;peaking or writing, has its peculiar tone
of conver&s;ation. He agrees with the maxim of Rou&s;&s;eau, that
three friends who wi&s;h to di&s;clo&s;e a common &s;ecret, will impart it
only <HI>deux &agrave; deux;</HI> and he is &s;atisfied that, on the pre&s;ent memorable
occa&s;ion, each of the per&s;ons of the Sheffield family will claim a
peculiar &s;hare in this triple mi&s;&s;ive, which will communicate, how|ever,
a triple &s;atisfaction. The experience of what may be effected
by vigorous re&s;olution, encourages the hi&s;torian to hope that he
&s;hall ca&s;t the &s;kin of the old &s;erpent, and hereafter &s;hew him&s;elf as
a new creature.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="288">
I lament, on all our accounts, that the la&s;t year's expedition to
Lau&s;anne did not take place in a golden period, of health and &s;pirits.
But we mu&s;t reflect, that human felicity is &s;eldom without alloy;
and if we cannot indulge the hope of your making a &s;econd vi&s;it to
Lau&s;anne, we mu&s;t look forwards to my re&s;idence next &s;ummer at
Sheffield-Place, where I mu&s;t find you in the full bloom of health,
&s;pirits, and beauty. I can perceive, by all public and private intel|ligence,
that your hou&s;e has been the open ho&s;pitable a&s;ylum of
French fugitives; and it is a &s;ufficient proof of the firmne&s;s of your
nerves, that you have not been overwhelmed or agitated by &s;uch a
concour&s;e of &s;trangers. Curio&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion may, in &s;ome de|gree,
have &s;upported you. Every day has pre&s;ented to your view
&s;ome new &s;cene of that &s;trange tragical romance, which occupies all
Europe &s;o infinitely beyond any event that has happened in our
time, and you have the &s;atisfaction of not being a mere &s;pectator of
the di&s;tre&s;s of &s;o many victims of fal&s;e liberty. The benevolent
fame of Lord S. is widely diffu&s;ed.</P>
<P>From Angletine's la&s;t letter to Maria, you have already &s;ome idea
of the melancholy &s;tate of her poor father. As long as Mr. de Se|very
allowed our hopes and fears to fluctuate with the changes of
his di&s;order, I was unwilling to &s;ay any thing on &s;o painful a &s;ub|ject;
and it is with the deepe&s;t concern that I now confe&s;s our ab|&s;olute
de&s;pair of his recovery. All his particular complaints are now
lo&s;t in a general di&s;&s;olution of the whole frame; every principle
of life is exhau&s;ted, and as often as I am admitted to his bed-&s;ide,
though he &s;till looks and &s;miles with the patience of an angel, I
have the heart-felt grief of &s;eeing him each day drawing nearer to
the term of his exi&s;tence. A few weeks, po&s;&s;ibly a few days, will
deprive me of a mo&s;t excellent friend, and break for ever the
mo&s;t perfect &s;y&s;tem of dome&s;tic happine&s;s, in which I had &s;o large
and intimate a &s;hare. Wilhelm (who has obtained leave of ab|&s;ence
<PB N="265" REF="289">
from his military duty) and his &s;i&s;ter behave and feel like
tender and dutiful children; but they have a long gay pro&s;pect of
life, and new connections, new families will make them forget, in
due time, the common lot of mortality. But it is Madame de Se|very
whom I truly pity; I dread the effects of the fir&s;t &s;hock, and I
dread &s;till more the deep perpetual con&s;uming affliction for a lo&s;s
which can never be retrieved. You will not wonder that &s;uch re|flections
&s;adden my own mind, nor can I forget how much my &s;ituation
is altered &s;ince I retired, nine years ago, to the banks of the Leman
Lake. The death of poor Deyverdun fir&s;t deprived me of a do|me&s;tic
companion, who can never be &s;upplied; and your vi&s;it has
only &s;erved to remind me that man, however amu&s;ed and occupied
in his clo&s;et, was not made to live alone. Severy will &s;oon be no
more; his widow for a long time, perhaps for ever, will be lo&s;t to
her&s;elf and her friends, the &s;on will travel, and I &s;hall be left a
&s;tranger in the in&s;ipid circle of mere common acquaintance. The
revolution of France, which fir&s;t embittered and divided the &s;ociety of
Lau&s;anne, has oppo&s;ed a barrier to my Su&s;&s;ex vi&s;it, and may finally
expel me from the paradi&s;e which I inhabit. Even that paradi&s;e,
the expen&s;ive and delightful e&s;tabli&s;hment of my hou&s;e, library, and
garden, almo&s;t becomes an incumbrance, by rendering it more dif|ficult
for me to relinqui&s;h my hold, or to form a new &s;y&s;tem of life
in my native country, for which my income, though improved and
improving, would be probably in&s;ufficient. But every complaint
&s;hould be &s;ilenced by the contemplation of the French; compared
with who&s;e cruel fate, all mi&s;ery is relative happine&s;s. I perfectly
concur in your partiality for Lally; though Nature might forget
&s;ome meaner ingredients, of prudence, oeconomy, &amp;c. &s;he never
formed a purer heart, or a brighter imagination. If he be with you,
I beg my kinde&s;t &s;alutations to him. I am every day more clo&s;ely
united with the Neckers. Should France break, and this country
<PB N="266" REF="290">
be over-run, they would be reduced, in very humble circum&s;tances,
to &s;eek a refuge; and where but in England? Adieu, dear Madam,
there is, indeed, much plea&s;ure in di&s;charging one's heart to a real
friend. Ever yours.</P>

<OPENER>[Send me a Li&s;t of the&s;e Letters, with their re&s;pective dates.]<DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>Nov. 25th, 1792.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER the triple labour of my la&s;t di&s;patch, your experience of
the creature might tempt you to &s;u&s;pect that it would again re|lap&s;e
into a long &s;lumber. But, partly from the &s;pirit of contradiction,
(though I am not a lady,) and partly from the ea&s;e and plea&s;ure which
I now find in the ta&s;k, you &s;ee me again alive, awake, and almo&s;t
faithful to my hebdomadal promi&s;e. The la&s;t week has not, how|ever,
afforded any events de&s;erving the notice of an hi&s;torian. Our
affairs are &s;till floating on the waves of the convention, and the rati|fication
of a corrected treaty, which had been fixed for the twentieth,
is not yet arrived; but the report of the diplomatic committee has
been favourable, and it is generally under&s;tood that the leaders of
the French republic do not wi&s;h to quarrel with the Swi&s;s. We are
gradually withdrawing and di&s;banding our militia. Geneva will be
left to &s;ink or &s;wim, according to the humour of the people; and our
la&s;t hope appears to be, that by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and good behaviour we
&s;hall avert for &s;ome time the impending &s;torm. A few days ago an
odd accident happened in the French army; the defertion of the ge|neral.
As the Neckers were &s;itting, about eight o'clock in the even|ing,
in their drawing-room at Rolle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A con&s;iderable town between Lau&s;anne and Geneva.</NOTE>, the door flew open, and they
<PB N="267" REF="291">
were a&s;tounded by their &s;ervant's announcing <HI>Mon&s;ieur le General
de Monte&s;quieu?</HI> On the receipt of &s;ome &s;ecret intelligence of a
<HI>decret d'accu&s;ation,</HI> and an order to arre&s;t him, he had only time to
get on hor&s;eback, to gallop through Geneva, to take boat for Copet,
and to e&s;cape from his pur&s;uers, who were ordered to &s;eize him alive
or dead. He left the Neckers after &s;upper, pa&s;&s;ed through Lau&s;anne
in the night, and proceeded to Berne and Ba&s;le, whence he intended
to wind his way through Germany, amid&s;t enemies of every de&s;crip|tion,
and to &s;eek a refuge in England, America, or the moon. He
told Necker, that the &s;ole remnant of his fortune con&s;i&s;ted in a
wretched &s;um of twenty thou&s;and livres; but the public report, or
&s;u&s;picion, be&s;peaks him in much better circum&s;tances. Be&s;ides the
reproach of acting with too much tamene&s;s and delay, he is accu&s;ed
of making very foul and exorbitant contracts; and it is certain that
new Sparta is infected with this vice, beyond the example of the
mo&s;t corrupt monarchy. Kellerman is arrived, to take the com|mand;
and it is apprehended that on the fir&s;t of December, after the
departure of the Swi&s;s, the French may <HI>reque&s;t</HI> the permi&s;&s;ion of
u&s;ing Geneva, a friendly city, for their winter quarters. In that
ca&s;e, the democratical revolution, which we all fore&s;ee, will be very
&s;peedily effected.</P>
<P>I would a&s;k you, whether you apprehend there was any trea&s;on in
the Duke of Brun&s;wick's retreat, and whether you have totally
withdrawn your confidence and e&s;teem from that once-famed ge|neral?
Will it be po&s;&s;ible for England to pre&s;erve her neutrality
with any honour or &s;afety? We are bound, as I under&s;tand, by
treaty, to guarantee the dominions of the King of Sardinia and the
Au&s;trian provinces of the Netherlands. The&s;e countries are now
invaded and over-run by the French. Can we refu&s;e to fulfil our
engagements, without expo&s;ing our&s;elves to all Europe as a per|fidious
or pu&s;illanimous nation? Yet, on the other hand, can we
a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e allies, without plunging headlong into an aby&s;s, who&s;e
<PB N="268" REF="292">
bottom no man can di&s;cover? But my chief anxiety is for our do|me&s;tic
tranquillity; for I mu&s;t find a retreat in England, &s;hould I
be driven from Lau&s;anne. The idea of firm and honourable union
of parties plea&s;es me much; but you mu&s;t frankly unfold what are the
great difficulties that may impede &s;o &s;alutary a mea&s;ure: you write to
a man di&s;creet in &s;peech, and now careful of papers. Yet what can
&s;uch a coalition avail? Where is the champion of the con&s;titution?
Alas, Lord Guildford! I am much plea&s;ed with the Manche&s;ter
A&s;s. The a&s;&s;es or wolves who &s;acrificed him have ca&s;t off the ma&s;k too
&s;oon; and &s;uch a non&s;en&s;ical act mu&s;t open the eyes of many &s;imple
patriots, who might have been led a&s;tray by the &s;pecious name of
reform. It &s;hould be made as notorious as po&s;&s;ible. Next winter may
be the cri&s;is of our fate, and if you begin to improve the con&s;titution,
you may be driven &s;tep by &s;tep from the disfranchi&s;ement of old
Sarum to the King in Newgate, the Lords voted u&s;ele&s;s, the Bi&s;hops
aboli&s;hed, and a Hou&s;e of Commons without articles (<HI>&s;ans cu|lottes</HI>). Necker has ordered you a copy of his royal defence, which
has met with, and de&s;erved, univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;s. The pathetic and
argumentative parts are, in my opinion, equally good, and his mild
eloquence may per&s;uade without irritating. I have applied to this
gentler tone &s;ome ver&s;es of Ovid, (Metamorph. l. iii. 302, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>Qu&agrave; tamen u&s;que pote&s;t, vires &s;ibi demere tentat.</L>

She talks wildly enough of vi&s;iting England this winter. She is a

<P>OUR little &s;torm has now completely &s;ub&s;ided, and we are again
&s;pectators, though anxious &s;pectators, of the general tempe&s;t that
invades or threatens almo&s;t every country of Europe. Our troops
are every day di&s;banding and returning home, and the greate&s;t part
of the French have evacuated the neighbourhood of Geneva. Mon|&s;ieur
Barthelemy, whom you have &s;een &s;ecretary in London, is mo&s;t
courteou&s;ly entertained, as amba&s;&s;ador, by the Helvetic body. He is
now at Berne, where a diet will &s;peedily be convened; the language
on both &s;ides is now pacific, and even friendly, and &s;ome hopes are

<P>WITH the return of peace I have relap&s;ed into my former indo|lence;
but now awakening, after a fortnight's &s;lumber, I have little
or nothing to add, with regard to the internal &s;tate of this country,
only the revolution of Geneva has already taken place, as I an|nounced,
but &s;ooner than I expected. The Swi&s;s troops had no
&s;ooner evacuated the place, than the <HI>Egali&s;eurs,</HI> as they are called,
a&s;&s;embled in arms; and as no re&s;i&s;tance was made, no blood was
&s;hed on the occa&s;ion. They &s;eized the gates, di&s;armed the garri&s;on,
impri&s;oned the magi&s;trates, imparted the rights of citizens to all the
rabble of the town and country, and proclaimed a <HI>National</HI> Conven|tion,
<PB N="270" REF="294">
which has not yet met. They are all for a pure and ab&s;olute
democracy; but &s;ome wi&s;h to remain a &s;mall independent &s;tate,
whil&s;t others a&s;pire to become a part of the republic of France; and
as the latter, though le&s;s numerous, are more violent and ab&s;urd
than their adver&s;aries, it is highly probable that they will &s;ucceed.
The citizens of the be&s;t families and fortunes have retired from Ge|neva
into the Pays de Vaud; but the French methods of recalling
or pro&s;cribing emigrants, will &s;oon be adopted. You mu&s;t have ob|&s;erved,
that Savoy is now become <HI>le department du Mont Blanc.</HI> I
cannot &s;atisfy my&s;elf, whether the ma&s;s of the people is plea&s;ed or
di&s;plea&s;ed with the change; but my noble &s;cenery is clouded by
the democratical a&s;pect of twelve leagues of the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, which
every morning obtrude them&s;elves on my view. I here conclude the
fir&s;t part of the hi&s;tory of our Alpine troubles, and now con&s;ider
my&s;elf as di&s;engaged from all promi&s;es of periodical writing. Upon
the whole, I kept it beyond our expectation; nor do I think that
you have been &s;ufficiently a&s;toni&s;hed by the wonderful effort of the
triple di&s;patch.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t now &s;ucceed to my ta&s;k, and I &s;hall expect, during
the winter, a regular political journal of the events of your greater
world. You are on the theatre, and may often be behind the &s;cenes.
You can always &s;ee, and may &s;ometimes fore&s;ee. My own choice has
indeed tran&s;ported me into a foreign land; but I am truly attached,
from intere&s;t and inclination, to my native country; and even as a
citizen of the world, I wi&s;h the &s;tability of England, the &s;ole great
refuge of mankind, again&s;t the oppo&s;ite mi&s;chiefs of de&s;poti&s;m and
democracy. I was indeed alarmed, and the more &s;o, as I &s;aw that
you were not without apprehen&s;ion; but I now glory in the triumph
of rea&s;on and genuine patrioti&s;m, which &s;eems to pervade the coun|try;
nor do I di&s;like &s;ome mixture of popular enthu&s;ia&s;m, which
may be requi&s;ite to encounter our mad or wicked enemies with equal
<PB N="271" REF="295">
arms. The behaviour of Fox does not &s;urpri&s;e me. You may re|member
what I told you la&s;t year at Lau&s;anne, when you attempted
his defence, that * * * * * * * * * * * * *

You have now cru&s;hed the daring &s;ubverters of the con&s;titution;
but I now fear the moderate well-meaners, reformers. Do not, I
be&s;eech you, tamper with parliamentary repre&s;entation. The pre|&s;ent
hou&s;e of commons forms, in <HI>practice,</HI> a body of gentlemen, who
mu&s;t always &s;ympathize with the intere&s;ts and opinions of the people;
and the &s;lighte&s;t innovation launches you, without rudder or com|pa&s;s,
on a dark and dangerous ocean of theoretical experiment. On
this &s;ubject I am indeed &s;erious.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I like the beginning of ninety-three better than
the end of ninety-two. The illu&s;ion &s;eems to break away through|out
Europe. I think England and Switzerland are &s;afe. Brabant
adheres to its old con&s;titution. The Germans are di&s;gu&s;ted with the
rapine and in&s;olence of their deliverers. The Pope is re&s;olved
to head his armies, and the Lazzaroni of Naples have pre&s;ented
St. Januarius with a gold fuzee, to fire on the Brigands Fran&ccedil;ois.
So much for politics, which till now never had &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
my mind. Next po&s;t I will write about my&s;elf and my own de|&s;igns.
Alas, your poor eyes! make the Maria write; I will &s;peedily
an&s;wer her. My Lady is &s;till dumb. The German po&s;ts are now
&s;low and irregular. You had better write by the way of France,

<P>THERE was formerly a time when our corre&s;pondence was a pain|ful
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of my private affairs; a vexatious repetition of
lo&s;&s;es, of di&s;appointments, of &s;ales, &amp;c. The&s;e affairs are decently
arranged: but public cares have now &s;ucceeded to private anxiety,
and our whole attention is lately turned from Lenborough and Be|riton,
to the political &s;tate of France and of Europe. From the&s;e
politics, however, one letter &s;hall be free, while I talk of my&s;elf and
of my own plans; a &s;ubject mo&s;t intere&s;ting to a friend, and only
to a friend.</P>
<P>I know not whether I am &s;orry or glad that my expedition has
been po&s;tponed to the pre&s;ent year. It is true, that I now wi&s;h my|&s;elf
in England, and almo&s;t repent that I did not gra&s;p the opportu|nity
when the ob&s;tacles were comparatively &s;maller than they are now
likely to prove. Yet had I reached you la&s;t &s;ummer before the
month of Augu&s;t, a con&s;iderable portion of my time would be now
elap&s;ed, and I &s;hould already begin to think of my departure. If
the gout &s;hould &s;pare me this winter, (and as yet I have not felt any
&s;ymptom,) and if the &s;pring &s;hould make a &s;oft and early appearance,
it is my intention to be with you in Downing-&s;treet before the end
of April, and thus to enjoy &s;ix weeks or two months of the mo&s;t
agreeable &s;ea&s;on of London and the neighbourhood, after the hurry
of parliament is &s;ub&s;ided, and before the great rural di&s;per&s;ion. As
the banks of the Rhine and the Belgic provinces are completely
over&s;pread with anarchy and war, I have made up my mind to pa&s;s
through the territories of the French republic. From the be&s;t and
mo&s;t recent information, I am &s;atisfied that there is little or no real
danger in the journey; and I mu&s;t arm my&s;elf with patience to &s;up|port
<PB N="273" REF="297">
the vexatious in&s;olence of democratical tyranny. I have even
a &s;ort of curio&s;ity to &s;pend &s;ome days at Paris, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the debates
of the Pandaemonium, to &s;eek an introduction to the principal devils,
and to contemplate a new form of public and private life, which
never exi&s;ted before, and which I devoutly hope will not long con|tinue
to exi&s;t. Should the ob&s;tacles of health or weather confine
me at Lau&s;anne till the month of May, I &s;hall &s;carcely be able to
re&s;i&s;t the temptation of pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome part at lea&s;t of the &s;ummer in
my own little paradi&s;e. But all the&s;e &s;chemes mu&s;t ultimately de|pend
on the great que&s;tion of peace and war, which will indeed be
&s;peedily determined. Should France become impervious to an Eng|li&s;h
traveller, what mu&s;t I do? I &s;hall not ea&s;ily re&s;olve to explore
my way through the unknown language and abominable roads of
the interior parts of Germany, to embark in Holland, or perhaps at
Hamburgh, and to be finally intercepted by a French privateer. My
&s;tay in England appears not le&s;s doubtful than the means of tran&s;|porting
my&s;elf. Should I arrive in the &s;pring, it is po&s;&s;ible, and
barely po&s;&s;ible, that I &s;hould return here in the autumn: it is much
more probable that I &s;hall pa&s;s the winter, and there may be even a
chance of my giving my own country a longer trial. In my letter
to my Lady I fairly expo&s;ed the decline of Lau&s;anne; but &s;uch an
e&s;tabli&s;hment as mine mu&s;t not be lightly abandoned; nor can I di&s;|cover
what adequate mode of life my private circum&s;tances, ea&s;y as
they now are, could afford me in England. London and Bath have
doubtle&s;s their re&s;pective merits, and I could wi&s;h to re&s;ide within a
day's journey of Sheffield-Place. But a &s;tate of perfect happine&s;s is
not to be found here below; and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my library,
hou&s;e, and garden, with the relicks of our &s;ociety, and a frequent
intercour&s;e with the Neckers, I may &s;till be tolerably content.
Among the di&s;a&s;trous changes of Lau&s;anne, I mu&s;t principally
reckon the approaching di&s;&s;olution of poor Severy and his family.
He is &s;till alive, but in &s;uch a hopele&s;s and painful decay, that we
<PB N="274" REF="298">
no longer conceal our wi&s;hes for his &s;peedy relea&s;e. I never loved
nor e&s;teemed him &s;o much as in this la&s;t mortal di&s;ea&s;e, which he
&s;upports with a degree of energy, patience, and even cheerfulne&s;s,
beyond all belief. His wife, who&s;e whole time and &s;oul are devoted
to him, is almo&s;t &s;inking under her long anxiety. The children are
mo&s;t amiably a&s;&s;iduous to both their parents, and, at all events, his
filial duties and worldly cares mu&s;t detain the &s;on &s;ome time at
home.</P>
<P>And now approach, and let me drop into your mo&s;t private ear
a literary &s;ecret. Of the Memoirs little has been done, and with
that little I am not &s;atisfied. They mu&s;t be po&s;tponed till a mature
&s;ea&s;on; and I much doubt whether the book and the Author can
ever &s;ee the light at the &s;ame time. But I have long revolved in my
mind another &s;cheme of biographical writing: the Lives, or rather
the Characters, of the mo&s;t eminent Per&s;ons in Arts and Arms, in
Church and State, who have flouri&s;hed in Britain from the reign of
Henry the Eighth to the pre&s;ent age. This work, exten&s;ive as it may
be, would be an amu&s;ement, rather than a toil: the materials are
acce&s;&s;ible in our own language, and, for the mo&s;t part, ready to my
hands: but the &s;ubject, which would afford a rich di&s;play of human
nature and dome&s;tic hi&s;tory, would powerfully addre&s;s it&s;elf to the
feelings of every Engli&s;hman. The ta&s;te or fa&s;hion of the times
&s;eems to delight in picture&s;que decorations; and this &s;eries of Briti&s;h
portraits might aptly be accompanied by the re&s;pective heads, taken
from originals, and engraved by the be&s;t ma&s;ters. Alderman Boy|dell,
and his &s;on-in-law, Mr. George Nicol, book&s;eller in Pall|mall,
are the great undertakers in this line. On my arrival in Eng|land
I &s;hall be free to con&s;ider, whether it may &s;uit me to proceed
in a mere literary work without any other decorations than tho&s;e
which it may derive from the pen of the Author. It is a &s;erious
truth, that I am no longer ambitious of fame or money; that my
<PB N="275" REF="299">
habits of indu&s;try are much impaired, and that I have reduced my
&s;tudies, to be the loo&s;e amu&s;ement of my morning hours, the re|petition
of which will in&s;en&s;ibly lead me to the la&s;t term of exi&s;t|ence.
And for this very rea&s;on I &s;hall not be &s;orry to bind my|&s;elf
by a liberal engagement, from which I may not with honour
recede.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, we mu&s;t &s;ay a word or two of parliamentary
and pecuniary concerns. 1. We all admire the generous &s;pirit with
which you damned the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins * *. I hope that * * * * *
The opinion of parliament in favour of Louis was declared in a
manner worthy of the repre&s;entatives of a great and a wi&s;e nation.
It will certainly have a powerful effect; and if the poor King be not
already murdered, I am &s;atisfied that his life is in &s;afety: but in &s;uch a
life worth his care? Our debates will now become every day more
intere&s;ting; and as I expect from you only opinions and anecdotes,
I mo&s;t earne&s;tly conjure you to &s;end me Woodfall's Regi&s;ter as often
(and that mu&s;t be very often) as the occa&s;ion de&s;erves it. I now
&s;pare no expence for news.</P>
<P>I want &s;ome account of Mrs. G.'s health. Will my Lady
never write? How can people be &s;o indolent! I &s;uppo&s;e this will
find you at Sheffield-Place during the rece&s;s, and that the heavy
baggage will not move till after the birth-day. Shall I be with you
by the fir&s;t of May? The Gods only know. I almo&s;t wi&s;h that
I had accompanied Madame de Stael. Ever yours.</P>

<P>THE &s;truggle is at length over, and poor de Severy is no more!
He expired about ten days ago, after every vital principle had
been exhau&s;ted by a complication of di&s;orders, which had la&s;ted
above five months: and a mortification in one of his legs, that gra|dually
ro&s;e to the more noble parts, was the immediate cau&s;e of his
death. His patience and even cheerfulne&s;s &s;upported him to the
fatal moment; and he enjoyed every comfort that could alleviate his
&s;ituation, the &s;kill of his phy&s;icians, the a&s;&s;iduous tenderne&s;s of his
family, and the kind &s;ympathy not only of his particular friends,
but even of common acquaintance, and generally of the whole town.
The &s;troke has been &s;everely felt: yet I have the &s;atisfaction to per|ceive
that Madame de Severy's health is not affected; and we may
hope that in time &s;he will recover a tolerable &s;hare of compo&s;ure and
happine&s;s. Her firmne&s;s has checked the violent &s;allies of grief;
her gentlene&s;s has pre&s;erved her from the wor&s;t of &s;ymptoms, a dry,
&s;ilent de&s;pair. She loves to talk of her irreparable lo&s;s, &s;he de&s;cants
with plea&s;ure on his virtues; her words are interrupted with tears,
but tho&s;e tears are her be&s;t relief; and her tender feelings will in&s;en|&s;ibly
&s;ub&s;ide into an affectionate remembrance. Wilhelm is much
more deeply wounded than I could imagine, or than he expected
him&s;elf: nor have I ever &s;een the affliction of a &s;on more lively and
&s;incere. Severy was indeed a very valuable man: without any
&s;hining qualifications, he was endowed in a high degree with good
&s;en&s;e, honour, and benevolence; and few men have filled with more
propriety their circle in private life. For my&s;elf, I have had the
misfortune of knowing him too late, and of lo&s;ing him too &s;oon.&mdash;
But enough of this melancholy &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="301">
The affairs of this theatre, which mu&s;t always be minute, are now
grown &s;o tame and tranquil, that they no longer de&s;erve the hi&s;to|rian's
pen. The new con&s;titution of Geneva is &s;lowly forming,
without much noi&s;e or any blood&s;hed; and the patriots, who have
&s;taid in hopes of guiding and re&s;training the multitude, flatter them|&s;elves
that they &s;hall be able at lea&s;t to prevent their mad countrymen
from giving them&s;elves to the French, the only mi&s;chief that would
be ab&s;olutely irretrievable. The revolution of Geneva is of le&s;s con|&s;equence
to us, however, than that of Savoy; but our fate will de|pend
on the general event, rather than on the&s;e particular cau&s;es.
In the mean while we hope to be quiet &s;pectators of the &s;truggle of
this year; and we &s;eem to have a&s;&s;urances that both the Emperor and
the French will compound for the neutrality of the Swi&s;s. The Hel|vetic
body does not acknowledge the republic of France; but Bar|thelemy,
their amba&s;&s;ador, re&s;ides at Baden, and &s;teals, like Chauve|lin,
into a kind of extra-official negotiation. All &s;pirit of oppo&s;i|tion
is quelled in the Canton of Berne, and the perpetual bani&s;hment
of the ****** family has &s;carcely excited a murmur. It will proba|bly
be followed by that of ****** *****: the crime alleged in
their &s;entence is the having a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the federation-dinner at Rolle
two years ago; and as they are ab&s;ent, I could almo&s;t wi&s;h that they
had been &s;ummoned to appear, and heard in their own defence. To
the general &s;upinene&s;s of the inhabitants of Lau&s;anne I mu&s;t a&s;cribe,
that the death of Louis the Sixteenth has been received with le&s;s
horror and indignation than I could have wi&s;hed. I was much
tempted to go into mourning, and probably &s;hould, had the Duche&s;s
been &s;till here; but, as the only Engli&s;hman of any mark, I was
afraid of being &s;ingular; more e&s;pecially as our French emigrants,
either from prudence or poverty, do not wear black, nor do even
the Neckers. Have you read his di&s;cour&s;e for the King? It might
indeed &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of mourning. I &s;hould judge from
your la&s;t letter, and from the Diary, that the French declaration of
<PB N="278" REF="302">
war mu&s;t have rather &s;urpri&s;ed you. I wi&s;h, although I know not
how it could have been avoided, that we might &s;till have continued
to enjoy our &s;afe and pro&s;perous neutrality. You will not doubt
my be&s;t wi&s;hes for the de&s;truction of the mi&s;creants; but I love
England &s;till more than I hate France. All rea&s;onable chances are
in favour of a confederacy, &s;uch as was never oppo&s;ed to the ambi|tion
of Louis the Fourteenth; but, after the experience of la&s;t year,
I di&s;tru&s;t rea&s;on, and confe&s;s my&s;elf fearful for the event. The
French are &s;trong in numbers, activity, enthu&s;ia&s;m; they are rich in
rapine; and, although their &s;trength may be only that of a phrenzy
fever, they may do infinite mi&s;chief to their neighbours before they
can be reduced to a &s;trait wai&s;tcoat. I dread the effects that may be
produced on the minds of the people by the increa&s;e of debt and
taxes, probable lo&s;&s;es, and po&s;&s;ible mi&s;management. Our trade mu&s;t
&s;uffer; and though projects of inva&s;ion have been always abortive, I
cannot forget that the fleets and armies of Europe have failed before
the towns in America, which have been taken and plundered by a
handful of Buccaneers. I know nothing of Pitt as a war mini&s;ter;
but it affords me much &s;atisfaction that the intrepid wi&s;dom of the

<P>MY deare&s;t Friend, for &s;uch you mo&s;t truly are, nor does there
exi&s;t a per&s;on who obtains, or &s;hall ever obtain, a &s;uperior
place in my e&s;teem and affection.</P>
<P>After too long a &s;ilence I was &s;itting down to write, when, only
ye&s;terday morning (&s;uch is now the irregular &s;lowne&s;s of the Engli&s;h
po&s;t), I was &s;uddenly &s;truck, indeed &s;truck to the heart, by the fatal
intelligence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The death of Lady Sheffield.</NOTE> from Sir Henry Clinton and Mr. de Lally. Alas! what
is life, and what are our hopes and projects! When I embraced her
at your deparure from Lau&s;anne, could I imagine that it was for
the la&s;t time? when I po&s;tponed to another &s;ummer my journey
to England, could I apprehend that I never, never &s;hould &s;ee her
again? I always hoped that &s;he would &s;pin her feeble thread
to a long duration, and that her delicate frame would &s;urvive
(as is often the ca&s;e) many con&s;titutions of a &s;touter appearance.
In four days! in your ab&s;ence, in that of her children! But &s;he
is now at re&s;t; and if there be a future life, her mild virtues
have &s;urely entitled her to the reward of pure and perfect feli|city.
It is for you that I feel, and I can judge of your &s;entiments
by comparing them with my own. I have lo&s;t, it is true, an ami|able
and affectionate friend, whom I had known and loved above
<PB N="280" REF="304">
three-and-twenty years, and whom I often &s;tyled by the endearing
name of &s;i&s;ter. But you are deprived of the companion of your life,
the wife of your choice, and the mother of your children; poor
children! the liveline&s;s of Maria, and the &s;oftne&s;s of Loui&s;a, render
them almo&s;t equally the objects of my tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion. I do not
wi&s;h to aggravate your grief; but, in the &s;incerity of friend&s;hip, I
cannot hold a different language. I know the impotence of rea&s;on,
and I much fear that the &s;trength of your character will &s;erve to
make a &s;harper and more la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The only con&s;olation in the&s;e melancholy trials to which human
life is expo&s;ed, the only one at lea&s;t in which I have any confidence,
is the pre&s;ence of a real friend; and of that, as far as it depends on
my&s;elf, you &s;hall not be de&s;titute. I regret the few days that mu&s;t
be lo&s;t in &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary preparations; but I tru&s;t that to-morrow
&s;e'nnight (May the fifth) I &s;hall be able to &s;et forwards on my jour|ney
to England; and when this letter reaches you, I &s;hall be con|&s;iderably
advanced on my way. As it is yet prudent to keep at a
re&s;pectful di&s;tance from the banks of the French Rhine, I &s;hall in|cline
a little to the right, and proceed by Schaffou&s;e and Stutgard to
Frankfort and Cologne: the Au&s;trian Netherlands are now open and
&s;afe, and I am &s;ure of being able at lea&s;t to pa&s;s from O&s;tend to
Dover; whence, without pa&s;&s;ing through London, I &s;hall pur|&s;ue
the direct road to Sheffield-Place. Unle&s;s I &s;hould meet with
&s;ome unfore&s;een accidents and delays, I hope, before the end of the
month to &s;hare your &s;olitude, and &s;ympathize with your grief. All
the difficulties of the journey, which my indolence had probably
magnified, have now di&s;appeared before a &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion; and you
will not be &s;orry to hear, that, as far as Frankfort to Cologne, I &s;hall
enjoy the advantage of the &s;ociety, the conver&s;ation, the German
language, and the active a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Severy. His attachment to me
is the &s;ole motive which prompts him to undertake this trouble&s;ome
journey; and as &s;oon as he has &s;een me over the roughe&s;t ground,
<PB N="281" REF="305">
he will immediately return to Lau&s;anne. The poor young man
loved Lady S. as a mother, and the whole family is deeply affected
by an event which reminds them too painfully of their own misfor|tune.
Adieu. I could write volumes, and &s;hall therefore break off
abruptly. I &s;hall write on the road, and hope to find a few lines
<HI>&agrave; po&s;te re&s;tante</HI> at Frankfort and Bru&s;&s;els. Adieu; ever yours.</P>

<P>I MUST write a few lines before my departure, though indeed I
&s;carcely know what to &s;ay. Nearly a fortnight has now elap&s;ed
&s;ince the fir&s;t melancholy tidings, without my having received the
&s;lighte&s;t &s;ub&s;equent accounts of your health and &s;ituation. Your
own &s;ilence announces too forcibly how much you are involved in
your feelings; and I can but too ea&s;ily conceive that a letter to me
would be more painful than to an indifferent per&s;on. But that ami|able
man Count Lally might &s;urely have written a &s;econd time; but
your &s;i&s;ter, who is probably with you; but Maria,&mdash;alas! poor Maria!
I am left in a &s;tate of darkne&s;s to the workings of my own fancy,
which imagines every thing that is &s;ad and &s;hocking. What can I
think of for your relief and comfort? I will not expatiate on tho&s;e
common-place topics, which have never dried a &s;ingle tear; but let
me advi&s;e, let me urge you to force your&s;elf into bu&s;ine&s;s, as I would
try to force my&s;elf into &s;tudy. The mind mu&s;t not be idle; if it
be not exerci&s;ed on external objects, it will prey on its own vitals.
A thou&s;and little arrangements, which mu&s;t precede a long journey,
have po&s;tponed my departure three or four days beyond the term
which I had fir&s;t appointed; but all is now in order, and I &s;et off
to-morrow, the ninth in&s;tant, with my <HI>valet de chambre,</HI> a courier
on hor&s;eback, and Severy, with his &s;ervant, as far as Frankfort. I
<PB N="282" REF="306">
calculate my arrival at Sheffield-Place (how I dread and de&s;ire to &s;ee
that man&s;ion!) for the fir&s;t week in June, &s;oon after this letter; but
I will try to &s;end you &s;ome later intelligence. I never found my&s;elf
&s;tronger, or in better health. The German road is now cleared,
both of enemies and allies, and though I mu&s;t expect fatigue, I
have not any apprehen&s;ions of danger. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible
that you &s;hould meet me at Frankfort, but I &s;hall be much di&s;ap|pointed
at not finding a line at Bru&s;&s;els or O&s;tend. Adieu. If there

<P>AND here I am in good health and &s;pirits, after one of the ea&s;ie&s;t,
&s;afe&s;t, and plea&s;ante&s;t journies which I ever performed in my
whole life; not the appearance of an enemy, and hardly the ap|pearance
of a war. Yet I hear, as I am writing, the cannon of the
&s;iege of Mayence, at the di&s;tance of twenty miles; and long, very
long, will it be heard. It is confe&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, that the French
fight with a courage worthy of a better cau&s;e. The town of May|ence
is &s;trong, their artillery admirable; they are already reduced
to hor&s;e-fle&s;h, but they have &s;till the re&s;ource of eating the inhabit|ants,
and at la&s;t of eating one another; and, if that repa&s;t could
to extended to Paris and the whole country, it might e&s;&s;entially
contribute to the relief of mankind. Our operations are carried
on with more than German &s;lowne&s;s, and when the be&s;ieged are
quiet, the be&s;iegers are perfectly &s;atisfied with their progre&s;s. A
&s;pirit of divi&s;ion undoubtedly prevails; and the character of the
Pru&s;&s;ians for courage and di&s;cipline is &s;unk lower than you can po&s;|&s;ibly
imagine. Their glory has expired with Frederick. I am &s;orry

<P>THIS day, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I am
arrived at this place in excellent pre&s;ervation. My expedition,
which is now drawing to a clo&s;e, has been a journey of per&s;everance
rather than &s;peed, of &s;ome labour &s;ince Frankfort, but without the

Ghent. On Wedne&s;day the 29th in&s;tant I &s;hall reach O&s;tend in

Frankfort. Beyond that I can &s;ay nothing po&s;itive; but &s;hould the

<DIV1 TYPE="editorial note">
<PB N="284" REF="308">
<P>THE preceding Letters intimate that, in return for my vi&s;it to
Lau&s;anne in 1791, Mr. Gibbon engaged to pa&s;s a year with
me in England; that the war having rendered travelling exceedingly
inconvenient, e&s;pecially to a per&s;on who, from his bodily infirmities,
required every accommodation, prevented his undertaking &s;o formi|dable
a journey at the time he propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The call of friend&s;hip, however, was &s;ufficient to make him over|look
every per&s;onal con&s;ideration, when he thought his pre&s;ence
might prove a con&s;olation. I mu&s;t ever regard it as the mo&s;t en|dearing
proof of his &s;en&s;ibility, and of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the true &s;pirit
of friend&s;hip, that after having relinqui&s;hed the thought of his in|tended
vi&s;it, he ha&s;tened to England, in &s;pite of encrea&s;ing impedi|ments,
to &s;oothe me by the mo&s;t generous &s;ympathy, and to alle|viate
my dome&s;tic affliction; neither his great corpulency, nor his
extraordinary bodily infirmities, nor any other con&s;ideration, could
prevent him a moment from re&s;olving on an undertaking that might
have deterred the mo&s;t active young man. He, almo&s;t immediately,
with alertne&s;s by no means natural to him, undertook a great cir|cuitous
journey, along the frontiers of an enemy, wor&s;e than &s;avage,
within the found of their cannon, within the range of the light
troops of the different armies, and through roads ruined by the enor|mous
machinery of war.</P>
<P>The readine&s;s with which he engaged in this kind office of friend|&s;hip,
at a time when a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit might have pleaded a thou&s;and
rea&s;ons for declining &s;o hazardous a journey, con&s;pired, with the pe|culiar
<PB N="285" REF="309">
charms of his &s;ociety to render his arrival a cordial to my
mind. I had the &s;atisfaction of finding that his own delicate and
precarious health had not &s;uffered in the &s;ervice of his friend, a
&s;ervice in which he di&s;regarded his own per&s;onal infirmities. He
arrived in the beginning of June at my hou&s;e in Downing-Street,
&s;afe and in good health; and after we had pa&s;&s;ed about a month to|gether
in London, we &s;ettled at Sheffield-Place for the &s;ummer;
where his wit, learning, and cheerful politene&s;s delighted a great
variety of characters.</P>
<P>Although he was inclined to repre&s;ent his health as better than it
really was, his habitual di&s;like to motion appeared to increa&s;e; his
inaptne&s;s to exerci&s;e confined him to the library and dining-room,
and there he joined my friend Mr. Frederick North, in plea&s;ant ar|guments
again&s;t exerci&s;e in general. He ridiculed the un&s;ettled and
re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition that &s;ummer, the mo&s;t uncomfortable, as he &s;aid,
of all &s;ea&s;ons, generally gives to tho&s;e who have the free u&s;e of their
limbs. Such arguments were little required to keep &s;ociety within
doors, when his company was only there to be enjoyed; for neither
the finene&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, nor the mo&s;t promi&s;ing parties of plea&s;ure,
could tempt the company of either &s;ex to de&s;ert him.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have enjoyed the &s;ociety of Mr. Gibbon will agree
with me, that his conver&s;ation was &s;till more captivating than his
writings. Perhaps no man ever divided time more fairly between
literary labour and &s;ocial enjoyment; and hence, probably, he de|rived
his peculiar excellence of making his very exten&s;ive knowledge
contribute, in the highe&s;t degree, to the u&s;e or plea&s;ure of tho&s;e with
whom he conver&s;ed. He united, in the happie&s;t manner imagin|able,
two characters which are not often found in the &s;ame per&s;on,
the profound &s;cholar and the fa&s;cinating companion.</P>
<P>It would be &s;uper&s;tuous to attempt a very minute delineation of a
character which is &s;o di&s;tinctly marked in the Memoirs and Letters.
<PB N="286" REF="310">
He has de&s;cribed him&s;elf without re&s;erve, and with perfect &s;incerity.
The Letters, and e&s;pecially the extracts from the Journal, which could
not have been written with any purpo&s;e of being &s;een, will make the
reader perfectly acquainted with the man.</P>
<P>Excepting a vi&s;it to Lord Egremont and Mr. Hayley, whom he
very particularly e&s;teemed, Mr. Gibbon was not ab&s;ent from Shef|field-Place
till the beginning of October, when we were reluctantly
obliged to part with him, that he might perform his engagement to
Mrs. Gibbon at Bath, the widow of his father, who had early de|&s;erved,
and invariably retained, his affection. From Bath he pro|ceeded
to Lord Spen&s;er's at Althorp, a family which he always met
with uncommon &s;atisfaction. He continued in good health during
the whole &s;ummer, and in excellent &s;pirits (I never knew him enjoy
better); and when he went from Sheffield-Place, little did I imagine
it would be the la&s;t time I &s;hould have the inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing him there in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of health.</P>
<P>The few following &s;hort letters, though not important in them|&s;elves,
will fill up this part of the narrative better, and more agree|ably,
than any thing I can &s;ub&s;titute in their place.</P>

I wi&s;h you back to Sheffield-Place. The health of dear Loui&s;a is
doubtle&s;s the fir&s;t object; but I did not expect Brighton after Tun|bridge.
Whenever dear little aunt is &s;eparate from you, I &s;hall cer|tainly

<P>I MUST at length withdraw the veil before my &s;tate of health,
though the naked truth may alarm you more than a fit of the
gout. Have you never ob&s;erved, through my inexpre&s;&s;ibles, a
large prominency <HI>circa genitalia,</HI> which, as it was not at all pain|ful,
and very little trouble&s;ome, I had &s;trangely neglected for
many years? But &s;ince my departure from Sheffield-Place it has
<PB N="291" REF="315">
increa&s;ed, (mo&s;t &s;tupendou&s;ly,) is increa&s;ing, and ought to be dimi|ni&s;hed.
Ye&s;terday I &s;ent for Farquhar, who is allowed to be a very
&s;kilful &s;urgeon. After viewing and palping, he very &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;ired
to call in a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and has examined it again to-day with Mr. Cline,
a &s;urgeon, as he &s;ays, of the fir&s;t eminence. They both pronounce
it a <HI>hydrocele,</HI> (a collection of water,) which mu&s;t be let out by the
operation of tapping; but, from its magnitude and long neglect,
they think it a mo&s;t extraordinary ca&s;e, and wi&s;h to have another
&s;urgeon, Dr. Bayley, pre&s;ent. If the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould go off &s;moothly,
I &s;hall be delivered from my burthen, (it is almo&s;t as big as a &s;mall
child,) and walk about in four or five days with a tru&s;s. But the
medical gentlemen, who never &s;peak quite plain, in&s;inuate to me
the po&s;&s;ibility of an inflammation, of fever, &amp;c. I am not ap|palled
at the thoughts of the operations, which is fixed for Wedne&s;|day
next, twelve o'clock; but it has occurred to me, that you might
wi&s;h to be pre&s;ent, before and afterwards, till the cri&s;is was pa&s;t; and
to give you that opportunity, I &s;hall &s;olicit a delay till Thur&s;day, or
even Friday. In the mean while, I crawl about with &s;ome labour,
and much indecency, to Devon&s;hire-Hou&s;e (where I left all the fine
Ladies making flannel wai&s;tcoats); Lady Lucan's, &amp;c. Adieu.
Varni&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s for the Ladies; yet I am afraid it will be public;
&mdash;the advantage of being notorious. Ever yours.</P>

IMMEDIATELY on receiving the la&s;t letter, I went the &s;ame day
from Brighthelm&s;tone to London, and was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to
find that Mr. Gibbon had dined at Lord Lucan's, and did not re|turn
to his lodgings, where I waited for him, till eleven o'clock at
night. Tho&s;e who have &s;een him within the la&s;t eight or ten
years, mu&s;t be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear, that he could doubt, whether
his di&s;order was apparent. When he returned to England in
1787, I was greatly alarmed by a prodigious increa&s;e, which I
always conceived to proceed from a rupture. I did not under&s;tand
why he, who had talked with me on every other &s;ubject relative to
him&s;elf and his affairs without re&s;erve, &s;hould never in any &s;hape
hint at a malady &s;o trouble&s;ome; but on &s;peaking to his valet de
chambre, he told me, Mr. Gibbon could not bear the lea&s;t allu&s;ion
to that &s;ubject, and never would &s;uffer him to notice it. I con|&s;ulted
&s;ome medical per&s;ons, who with me &s;uppo&s;ing it to be a
rupture, were of opinion that nothing could be done, and &s;aid that
he &s;urely mu&s;t have had advice, and of cour&s;e had taken all ne|ce&s;&s;ary
precautions. He now talked freely with me about his di&s;|order;
which, he &s;aid, began in the year 1761; that he then con|&s;ulted
Mr. Hawkins the &s;urgeon, who did not decide whether it was
the beginning of a rupture, or an hydrocele; but he de&s;ired to &s;ee
Mr. Gibbon again when he came to town. Mr. Gibbon not feel|ing
any pain, nor &s;uffering any inconvenience, as he &s;aid, never
returned to Mr. Hawkins; and although the di&s;order continued to
increa&s;e gradually, and of late years very much indeed, he never
mentioned it to any per&s;on, however incredible it may appear, from
1761 to November 1793. I told him, that I had always &s;uppo&s;ed
there was no doubt of its being a rupture; his an&s;wer was, that he
never thought &s;o, and that he, and the &s;urgeons who attended him,
<PB N="293" REF="317">
were of opinion that it was an hydrocele. It is now certain that
it was originally a rupture, and that an hydrocele had lately taken
place in the &s;ame part; and it is remarkable, that his legs, which had
been &s;welled about the ankle, particularly one of them, &s;ince he
had the eri&s;ipelas in 1790, recovered their former &s;hape as &s;oon as
the water appeared in another part, which did not happen till be|tween
the time he left Sheffield-Place, in the beginning of October,
and his arrival at Althorpe, towards the latter end of that month.
On the Thur&s;day following the date of his la&s;t letter, Mr. Gibbon
was tapped for the fir&s;t time; four quarts of a tran&s;parent watery
fluid were di&s;charged by that operation. Neither inflammation nor
fever en&s;ued; the tumour was dimini&s;hed to nearly half its &s;ize; the
remaining part was a &s;oft irregular ma&s;s. I had been with him two
days before, and I continued with him above a week after the fir&s;t
tapping, during which time he enjoyed his u&s;ual &s;pirits; and the
three medical gentlemen who attended him will recollect his plea|&s;antry,
even during the operation. He was abroad again in a few
days, but the water evidently collecting very fa&s;t, it was agreed that
a &s;econd puncture &s;hould be made a fortnight after the fir&s;t. Know|ing
that I &s;hould be wanted at a meeting in the country, he pre&s;&s;ed
me to attend it, and promi&s;ed that &s;oon after the &s;econd operation
was performed he would follow me to Sheffield-Place; but before
he arrived I received the two following Letters:</P>

<P>IT will not be in my power to reach Sheffield-Place quite &s;o &s;oon as
I wi&s;hed and expected. Lord Auckland informs me, that he &s;hall
be at Lambeth next week, Tue&s;day, Wedne&s;day, and Thur&s;day. I
have therefore agreed to dine at Beckenham on Friday. Saturday will
be &s;pent there, and unle&s;s &s;ome extraordinary temptation &s;hould de|tain
me another day, you will &s;ee me by four o'clock Sunday the ninth
of December. I dine to-morrow with the Chancellor at Hamp&s;tead,
and, what I do not like at this time of the year, without a propo&s;al to
&s;tay all night. Yet I would not refu&s;e, more e&s;pecially as I had de|nied
him on a former day. My health is good; but I &s;hall have a
final interview with Farquhar before I leave town. We are &s;till in

Mr. Gibbon generally took the opportunity of pa&s;&s;ing a night
or two with his friend Lord Auckland, at Eden-Farm, (ten miles
from London,) on his pa&s;&s;age to Sheffield-Place; and notwith|&s;tanding
his indi&s;po&s;ition, he had lately made an excur&s;ion thither
from London; when he was much plea&s;ed by meeting the Arch|bi&s;hop
of Canterbury, of whom he expre&s;&s;ed an high opinion. He
returned to London, to dine with Lord Loughborough, to meet
Mr. Burke, Mr. Windham, and particularly Mr. Pitt, with whom
he was not acquainted; and in his la&s;t journey to Su&s;&s;ex, he re|vi&s;ited
Eden-Farm, and was much gratified by the opportunity of
again &s;eeing, during a whole day, Mr. Pitt, who pa&s;&s;ed the night
there. From Lord Auckland's, Mr. Gibbon proceeded to Sheffield-Place;
and his di&s;cour&s;e was never more brilliant, nor more entertain|ing,
than on his arrival. The parallels he drew, and the compari&s;ons
he made, between the leading men of this country, were &s;ketched
in his be&s;t manner, and were infinitely intere&s;ting. However, this
la&s;t vi&s;it to Sheffield-Place became far different from any he had ever
made before. That ready, cheerful, various, and illuminating con|ver&s;ation,
which we had before admired in him, was not now always
to be found in the library or the dining-room. He moved with
difficulty, and retired from company &s;ooner than he had been u&s;ed
to do. On the twenty-third of December, his appetite began to fail
him. He ob&s;erved to me, that it was a very bad &s;ign <HI>with him</HI>
when he could not eat his breakfa&s;t, which he had done at all times
very heartily; and this &s;eems to have been the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ion
of apprehen&s;ion that the was ever ob&s;erved to utter. A con&s;iderable
degree of fever now made its appearance. Inflammation aro&s;e, from
the weight and the bulk of the tumour. Water again collected very
fa&s;t, and when the &s;ever went off, he never entirely recovered his ap|petite
<PB N="296" REF="320">
even for breakfa&s;t. I became very unea&s;y indeed at his &s;ituation
towards the end of the month, and thought it nece&s;&s;ary to advi&s;e him
to &s;et out for London. He had before &s;ettled his plan to arrive
there about the middle of January. I had company in the hou&s;e,
and we expected one of his particular friends; but he was obliged
to &s;acrifice all &s;ocial plea&s;ure to the immediate attention which his
health required. He went to London on the &s;eventh of January,
and the next day I received the following billet; the la&s;t he ever
wrote:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>EDWARD GIBBON E&s;q. to Lord SHEFFIELD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>ST. JAMES'S-STREET, <DATE>four o'clock, Tue&s;day.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS date &s;ays every thing. I was almo&s;t killed between Shef|field-Place
and Ea&s;t-Grin&s;ted, by hard, frozen, long, and cro&s;s
ruts, that would di&s;grace the approach of an Indian wig-wam.
The re&s;t was &s;omething le&s;s painful; and I reached this place half|dead,
but not &s;eriou&s;ly feveri&s;h, or ill. I found a dinner invitation
from Lord Lucan; but what are dinners to me? I wi&s;h they did
not know of my departure. I catch the flying po&s;t. What
an effort! Adieu, till Thur&s;day or Friday.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="editorial note">
<P>By his own de&s;ire, I did not follow him till Thur&s;day the ninth.
I then found him far from well. The tumour more di&s;tended than
before, inflamed, and ulcerated in &s;everal places. Remedies were
applied to abate the inflammation; but it was not thought proper to
puncture the tumour for the third time, till Monday the 13th of
January, when no le&s;s than &s;ix quarts of fluid were di&s;charged. He
&s;eemed much relieved by the evacuation. His &s;pirits continued
good. He talked, as u&s;ual, of pa&s;&s;ing his time at hou&s;es which he
<PB N="297" REF="321">
had often frequented with great plea&s;ure, the Duke of Devon|&s;hire's,
Mr. Craufurd's, Lord Spen&s;er's, Lord Lucan's, Sir Ralph
Payne's, and Mr. Batt's; and when I told him that I &s;hould not re|turn
to the country, as I had intended, he pre&s;&s;ed me to go; know|ing
I had an engagement there on public bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;aid, <Q>you
may be back on Saturday, and I intend to go on Thur&s;day to De|von&s;hire-Hou&s;e.</Q>
I had not any apprehen&s;ion that his life was
in danger, although I began to fear that he might not be re&s;tored to
a comfortable &s;tate, and that motion would be very trouble&s;ome to
him; but he talked of a radical cure. He &s;aid, that it was fortunate
the di&s;order had &s;hewn it&s;elf while he was in England, where he might
procure the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and if a radical cure could not be obtained
before his return to Lau&s;anne, there was an able &s;urgeon at Geneva,
who could come to tap him when it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the fourteenth, when the ri&s;k of inflammation and
fever from the la&s;t operation was &s;uppo&s;ed to be over, as the medical
gentlemen who attended him expre&s;&s;ed no fears for his life, I went
that afternoon part of the way to Su&s;&s;ex, and the following day
reached Sheffield-Place. The next morning, the &s;ixteenth, I received
by the po&s;t a good account of Mr. Gibbon, which mentioned al&s;o
that he hourly gained &s;trength. In the evening came a letter by ex|pre&s;s,
dated noon that day, which acquainted me that Mr. Gibbon
had had a violent attack the preceding night, and that it was not
probable he &s;hould live till I could come to him. I reached his
lodgings in St. James's-&s;treet about midnight, and learned that my
friend had expired a quarter before one o'clock that day, the &s;ixteenth
of January 1794.</P>
<P>After I left him on Tue&s;day afternoon the fourteenth, he &s;aw &s;ome
company, Lady Lucan and Lady Spen&s;er, and thought him&s;elf well
enough at night to omit the opium draught, which he had been u&s;ed
to take for &s;ome time. He &s;lept very indifferently; before nine the
<PB N="298" REF="322">
next morning he ro&s;e, but could not eat his breakfa&s;t. However, he
appeared tolerably well, yet complained at times of a pain in his &s;to|mach.
At one o'clock he received a vi&s;it of an hour from Madame
de Sylva, and at three, his friend, Mr. Craufurd, of Auchinames,
(whom he always mentioned with particular regard,) called, and
&s;tayed with him till pa&s;t five o'clock. They talked, as u&s;ual, on
various &s;ubjects; and twenty hours before his death, Mr. Gibbon
happened to fall into a conver&s;ation, not uncommon with him, on
the probable duration of his life. He &s;aid, that he thought him&s;elf
a good life for ten, twelve, or perhaps twenty years. About &s;ix,
he ate the wing of a chicken, and drank three gla&s;&s;es of Madeira.
After dinner he became very unea&s;y and impatient; complained
a good deal, and appeared &s;o weak, that his &s;ervant was alarmed.
Mr. Gibbon had &s;ent to his friend and relation, Mr. Robert Darell,
who&s;e hou&s;e was not far di&s;tant, de&s;iring to &s;ee him, and adding,
that he had &s;omething particular to &s;ay. But, unfortunately, this
de&s;ired interview never took place.</P>
<P>During the evening he complained much of his &s;tomach, and of
a di&s;po&s;ition to vomit. Soon after nine, he took his opium draught,
and went to bed. About ten, he complained of much pain, and de|&s;ired
that warm napkins might be applied to his &s;tomach. He almo&s;t
ince&s;&s;antly expre&s;&s;ed a &s;en&s;e of pain till about four o'clock in the
morning, when he &s;aid he found his &s;tomach much ea&s;ier. About
&s;even, the &s;ervant a&s;ked, whether he &s;hould &s;end for Mr. Farquhar?
he an&s;wered, no; that he was as well as he had been the day before.
At about half pa&s;t eight, he got out of bed, and &s;aid he was "<HI>plus
adroit</HI>" than he had been for three months pa&s;t, and got into bed again,
without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, better than u&s;ual. About nine, he &s;aid that he
would ri&s;e. The &s;ervant, however, per&s;uaded him to remain in bed
till Mr. Farquhar, who was expected at eleven, &s;hould come.
Till about that hour he &s;poke with great facility. Mr. Farquhar
<PB N="299" REF="323">
came at the time appointed, and he was then vi&s;ibly dying. When
the <HI>valet de chambre</HI> returned, after attending Mr. Farquhar out of
the room, Mr. Gibbon &s;aid, "<HI>Pourquoi e&s;t ce que vous me quittez?</HI>"
This was about half pa&s;t eleven. At twelve, he drank &s;ome brandy
and water from a tea-pot, and de&s;ired his favourite &s;ervant to &s;tay
with him. The&s;e were the la&s;t words he pronounced articulately.
To the la&s;t he pre&s;erved his &s;en&s;es; and when he could no longer
&s;peak, his &s;ervant having a&s;ked a que&s;tion, he made a &s;ign, to &s;hew
that he under&s;tood him. He was quite tranquil, and did not &s;tir;
his eyes half-&s;hut. About a quarter before one, he cea&s;ed to breathe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The body was not opened till the fifth day after his death. It was then &s;ound, except that a degree of mortification, not very con&s;iderable, had taken place on a part of the <HI>colon;</HI> which, with the whole of the <HI>omentum,</HI> of a very enlarged &s;ize, had de&s;cended into the <HI>&s;crotum,</HI> forming a bag that hung down nearly as low as the knee. Since that part had been inflamed and ulcerated, Mr. Gibbon could not bear a trufs; and when the la&s;t &s;ix quarts of fluid were di&s;charged, the <HI>colon</HI> and <HI>omentum</HI> de&s;cending lower, they, by their weight, drew the lower mouth of the &s;tomach downwards to the <HI>os pubis,</HI> and this probably was the immediate cau&s;e of his death.</P>
<P>The following is the account of the appearance of the body, given by an eminent &s;urgeon who opened it:</P><Q><P>Aperto tumore, qui ab inguine u&s;que ad genu &s;e extenderat, ob&s;ervatum e&s;t partem ejus inferiorem con&s;tare ex tunic&acirc; vaginati te&s;tis continenti duas qua&s;i libras liquoris &s;ero&s;i tincti &s;anguine.

not the mournful gratification of being near him on the day he ex|pired,

THE Letters of Mr. Gibbon, from the time of his return to
Switzerland in 1788, are annexed to his Memoirs, as the be&s;t con|tinuation
of them. Among his Letters of an earlier date, I find
&s;everal which he has alluded to, and other which will illu&s;trate the
account he has given of him&s;elf. The&s;e, I flatter my&s;elf, will
plea&s;e the generality of readers; &s;ince, when he touches on matters
of private bu&s;ine&s;s, even &s;ubjects of the drie&s;t nature become inte|re&s;ting,
from his mode of treating them. Many Letters from di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
per&s;ons to him will be introduced, and &s;ome that he received
at a very early period of life. Although we have not all his own
Letters to which the&s;e were an&s;wers, yet we have enough to te&s;tify
his ambition, even in youth, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed as a &s;cholar.</P>
<P>It has been &s;ometimes thought nece&s;&s;ary to offer to the Public an
apology for the publication of private Letters. I have no &s;cruple to
&s;ay, that I publi&s;h the&s;e, becau&s;e I think they place my friend in
an advantageous point of view. He might not, perhaps, have ex|pected
that all his Letters &s;hould be printed; but I have no rea&s;on
to believe that he would have been aver&s;e to the publication of any.
If I had, they never would have been made public, however highly
I might have conceived of their excellence.</P>

<P>I AM extremely obliged by your expre&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem, without taking
them in the literal &s;en&s;e, and believing my&s;elf an oracle. But I am a lover
of truth and &s;incerity, and always ready to avail my&s;elf of the communica|tions
of my learned friends. With the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, therefore, I received
<PB N="308" REF="329">
your ingenious conjecture illu&s;trating a pa&s;&s;age of Livy, by which I had
been puzzled. I adopt all your ob&s;ervations and rea&s;onings. By changing
a &s;ingle letter, you &s;ub&s;titute, in&s;tead of an aukward and ob&s;cure meaning, a
thought per&s;picuous in it&s;elf, &s;uitable to the character of the &s;peaker, and
connected with the purport of his di&s;cour&s;e. I &s;hall not fail noticing this
judicious correction, when an opportunity occurs, and mentioning the name
of the per&s;on to whom I am indebted for it.</P>
<P>I will add only one remark, of &s;mall importance indeed, but nece&s;&s;ary for
giving complete correctne&s;s to the pa&s;&s;age with which your attention has been
&s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully occupied. With your emendation it runs thus: <HI>Nec e&s;&s;e in vos
otio ve&s;tro con&s;ultum ab Romanis credatis.</HI> The <HI>in vos</HI> does not appear to me
to corre&s;pond well with <HI>otio ve&s;tro;</HI> &s;ince it &s;eems to indicate &s;omething
adver&s;e to the intere&s;t of the Carthaginians, and therefore does not accord
well with the idea of their tranquillity. In&s;tead of the words <HI>in vos</HI> I would
read <HI>in his;</HI> which would render the pa&s;&s;age perfectly correct. <HI>Nec e&s;&s;e
<PB N="309" REF="330">
in his otio ve&s;tro con&s;ultum ab Romanis credatis.</HI> <Q>Do not believe that the
Romans, when they deprive you of your forces, and forbid you to make
war on foreign nations, mean thereby to promote your tranquillity.</Q></P>
<P>It remains only, Sir, that I &s;hould thank you for your goodne&s;s in com|municating
to me &s;o happy a thought. It would give me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure

<P>&Agrave; PRESENT queme voil&agrave; &eacute;chapp&eacute; de l'orage des fonctions publiques
donc cette &eacute;gli&s;e e&s;t charg&eacute;e en tems de f&ecirc;te, je &s;ai&s;is avec joie
quelques momens de repos pour m'entretenir, Mon&s;ieur, avec vous:
ce &s;era, s'il vous plait, &s;ans faire de trop grands efforts &s;ur l'article
des id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es que vous me propo&s;ez. Outre que je ri&s;querois de
dire comme je ne &s;ais quelle des interlocutrices de Terence, <HI>Magno
conatu magnas nugas;</HI> il y a fort long tems que je n'ai relu
M. Locke, l'oracle moderne &s;ur cette mati&egrave;re, et il faudroit trop de
tems et de papier pour tout &eacute;plucher. Ayez donc la bont&eacute; de vous
contenter des premi&egrave;res r&eacute;flexions qui &s;e pr&eacute;&s;enteront &s;ur quelques
endroits de &s;on premier livre.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="332">
Je commence par le chap. i. &sect; 5. o&ugrave; cet habile homme entreprend
de prouver que ces deux principes, <HI>Ce qui e&s;t, e&s;t; il e&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
qu'une m&ecirc;me cho&s;e &s;oit, et en m&ecirc;me temps ne &s;oit pas,</HI> ne &s;ont point
inn&eacute;es, pui&s;qu'ils n'&eacute;toient point dans l'e&s;prit pendant l'enfance; et
la preuve qu'ils n'y &eacute;toient pas, c'e&s;t que l'enfant n'y pen&s;oit point,
et que bien des gens meurent, &s;ans les avoir jamais apper&ccedil;us; <Q>or, dit M. Locke, une id&eacute;e ne &s;auroit &ecirc;tre dans l'e&s;prit, &s;ans que l'e&s;prit
ne s'en apper&ccedil;oive,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Il e&s;t clair, Mon&s;ieur, que toute la force de ce rai&s;onnement, e&s;t
dans cette derni&egrave;re a&s;&s;ertion; mais cette a&s;&s;ertion n'e&s;t elle pas evi|demment
d&eacute;truite par l'exp&eacute;rience? Apper&ccedil;evez vous actuellement
toutes les id&eacute;es que vous avez dans l'e&s;prit? N'y en a t'il point au|quelles
vous ne prendrez peut&ecirc;tre garde de plu&s;ieurs ann&eacute;es? Et
dans les efforts que l'on fait &s;ouvent pour rappeller ce qu'on a confi&eacute;
&agrave; &s;a m&eacute;moire; ne &s;ent on pas qu'il peut y avoir des connoi&s;&s;ances &s;i
cach&eacute;es dans &s;es replis, que loin de les apper&ccedil;evoir &s;ans ce&s;&s;e, il faut
bien de la peine pour les rattrapper? Je &s;ais que M. Locke, qui a
<PB N="312" REF="333">
&s;enti la difficult&eacute;, tache de la r&eacute;&s;oudre. Ch. iii. &sect; 20. Mais en v&eacute;|rit&eacute;,
la longueur et l'embarras de cet article montre a&s;&s;ez que M. L.
n'&eacute;toit par &agrave; &s;on ai&s;e en l'&eacute;crivant; et comment y auroit il &eacute;t&eacute;?
Voici, autant que j'en puis juger, &agrave; quoi il &s;e r&eacute;duit. Il avoue, <Q>Que
nous avons dans l'e&s;prit des id&eacute;es que nous n'apper&ccedil;evons point
actuellement; mais, dit-il, c'e&s;t dans la <HI>m&eacute;moire</HI> qu'elles &s;ont: et
cela e&s;t &s;i vrai, qu'on ne &s;e les rappelle point &s;ans &s;e &s;ouvenir, en
m&ecirc;me temps, qu'on les a d&eacute;j&agrave; apper&ccedil;ues. Or, tel n'e&s;t point le
cas des <HI>id&eacute;es</HI> qu'on pretend <HI>inn&eacute;es.</HI> Quand on les apper&ccedil;oit pour
la premi&egrave;re fois, ce n'e&s;t point avec r&eacute;mini&s;cence, comme on de|vroit,
&s;i ces id&eacute;es l&agrave; avoient &eacute;t&eacute; dans l'e&s;prit avant cette premi&egrave;re
apperception, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>De gr&acirc;ce, Mon&s;ieur, croyez vous que M. Locke s'entendit bien
lui m&ecirc;me, quand il di&s;tinguoit <HI>etre dans l'e&s;prit</HI> et <HI>etre dans la m&eacute;|moire?</HI>
Et qu'importe &agrave; la que&s;tion, qu'on &s;e &s;ouvienne d'avoir
d&eacute;j&agrave; &s;u ce que l'on &s;e rappelle, s'il n'en e&s;t pas moins vrai qu'on l'a
eu long temps dans l'e&s;prit &s;ans s'en apper&ccedil;evoir; ce qui e&s;t le point
<PB N="313" REF="334">
dont il s'agit? Au re&s;te, M. Locke auroit pu &s;entir que &s;i l'on ne
&s;e <HI>rappelle</HI> point les id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es par <HI>r&eacute;mini&s;cence,</HI> e'e&s;t qu'elles ne
&s;ont point entr&eacute;es dans l'e&s;prit d'une mani&egrave;re qui ait exig&eacute;, ou attir&eacute;
&s;on attention. Et c'e&s;t au&s;&s;i le cas de plu&s;ieurs id&eacute;es acqui&s;es; car,
quoiqu'en dire M. Locke, chacun &s;e trouve au be&s;oin, nombre d'id&eacute;es
qui ne peuvent s'&ecirc;tre in&s;inu&eacute;es dans &s;on e&s;prit, qu'&agrave; la pr&eacute;&s;ence
de certains objets, auquels il n'a point pris garde, ou, en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral,
par des moyens inconnus, qui l'ont enrichi &s;ans qu'il &s;ache com|ment,
et &s;ans qu'il cr&ucirc;t les avoir ju&s;ques au moment qu'elles &s;e
&s;ont pr&eacute;&s;ent&eacute;es.</P>
<P>Sur le fond m&ecirc;me de la que&s;tion, il me &s;emble que M. Locke
confond perp&eacute;tuellement deux cho&s;es tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rentes. <HI>L'id&eacute;e elle
m&ecirc;me,</HI> qui e&s;t une connoi&s;&s;ance dans l'e&s;prit et un principe de rai|&s;onnement;
et <HI>l'&eacute;nonc&eacute; de cette id&eacute;e</HI> en forme de propo&s;ition, ou de
d&eacute;finition. Il &s;e peut, et il e&s;t m&ecirc;me tr&egrave;s probable, que bien des
gens n'ont jamais form&eacute; ou envi&s;ag&eacute; en eux m&ecirc;mes cet &eacute;nonc&eacute;,
<PB N="314" REF="335">
<HI>il e&s;t impo&s;&s;ible qu'une cho&s;e &s;oit, et ne &s;oit pas en m&ecirc;me tems.</HI> Voyez
Liv. 1. ch. i. &sect; 12. Mais &s;uit-il del&agrave;, qu'ils ne connoi&s;&s;ent pas la
v&eacute;rit&eacute; qu'il exprime, et qu'ils n'en ont pas l'id&eacute;e?&mdash;Nullement. Tout
homme qui a&s;&s;ure, qui nie, tout homme qui parle, un enfant quand
il demande, quand il refu&s;e, quand il &s;e plaint, &amp;c. ne &s;uppo&s;e t'il
pas, que d&egrave;s qu'une cho&s;e e&s;t, il e&s;t impo&s;&s;ible qu'en m&ecirc;me tems.
elle ne &s;oit pas? Ne trouvez vous pas, Mon&s;ieur, qu'on pourroit
&s;outenir la r&eacute;alit&eacute; des id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es, pr&eacute;ci&s;&eacute;ment &s;ur ce que M. Locke
all&eacute;gue contre elles, que beaucoup de gens n'ont jamais pen&s;&eacute; aux
propo&s;itions &eacute;videntes dont il parle; car, pui&s;que &s;ans y avoir
pen&s;&eacute;, ils s'en &s;ervent, ils b&acirc;ti&s;&s;ent l&agrave; de&s;&s;us, ils jugent de la v&eacute;rit&eacute;,
ou de l'ab&s;urdit&eacute; d'un di&s;cours par &s;es rapports avec ces principes
l&agrave;, &amp;c. D'o&ugrave; leur vient cette familiarit&eacute; avec des principes qu'ils
n'ont jamais apperc&ccedil;us di&s;tinctement, &s;i ce n'e&s;t de ce qu'ils en ont
une connoi&s;&s;ance, ou &s;i l'on veut, un &s;entiment naturel?</P>
<P>Aux &sect; 17 et 18, M. Locke nei que le con&s;entement que l'on
donne &agrave; certaines propo&s;itions, d&egrave;s qu'on les entend prononcer, &s;oit
<PB N="315" REF="336">
une preuve que l'id&eacute;e qu'elles expriment &s;oit inn&eacute;e; et il &s;e fonde,
&s;ur ce qu'il y a bien des propo&s;itions que l'on re&ccedil;oit ain&s;i d'abord,
qui certainement ne &s;ont point inn&eacute;es; et il en donne divers ex|emples,
viz. <HI>deux &amp; deux &s;ont quotre,</HI> &amp;c. Mais ne vous paro&icirc;tra
t'il pas qu'il confond i&ccedil;i de &s;imples d&eacute;finitions de mots avec des
v&eacute;rit&eacute;s &eacute;videntes par elles m&ecirc;mes? Au moins, e&s;t il certain que
tous &s;es exemples &s;ont de &s;imples d&eacute;finitions des mots, <HI>deux et deux
&s;ont quatre.</HI> L'id&eacute;e qu'on exprime par <HI>deux et deux,</HI> e&s;t la m&ecirc;me
que celle qu'on exprime par <HI>quatre,</HI> &amp;c. Or per&s;onne ne dit que
la connoi&s;&s;ance d'une d&eacute;finition de mots &s;oit inn&eacute;e, pui&s;qu'elle &s;up|po&s;e
celle du langage. Mais cette propo&s;ition, <HI>le tout e&s;t plus grand
que chacune de &s;es parties,</HI> n'e&s;t point dans ce cas; et il e&s;t certain
que le plus petit enfant &s;uppo&s;e la v&eacute;rit&eacute; de cette propo&s;ition
toutes les fois que non content d'une moiti&eacute; de pomme, il veut la
pomme toute enti&egrave;re.</P>
<P>Prenez la peine, Mon&s;ieur, d'examiner le &sect; 23; o&ugrave; M. Locke veut
convaincre de fau&s;&s;et&eacute; cette &s;uppo&s;ition, qu'il y a des principes tel|lement
<HI>inn&eacute;s,</HI> que ceux qui en entendent pour la premi&egrave;re fois, et
<PB N="316" REF="337">
qui en comprennent l'&eacute;nonc&eacute;, n'apprennent rien de nouveau. <Q>Pre|mi&egrave;rement,
dit-il, il e&s;t clair qu'ils ont appris les <HI>termes</HI> de l'&eacute;nonc&eacute;
et la <HI>&s;ignification</HI> de ces termes.</Q> Mais qui ne voit que M. Locke
&s;ort de la que&s;tion? Per&s;onne n'a jamais dit que des termes, qui ne
&s;ont que des &s;ignes arbitraires de nos id&eacute;es, fu&s;&s;ent inn&eacute;s. Il ajoute,
<Q>Que les id&eacute;es renferm&eacute;es dans de pareils &eacute;nonc&eacute;s ne nai&s;&s;ent pas
plus avec nous, que leurs expre&s;&s;ions, et qu'on acquiert ces id&eacute;es
dans la &s;uite apr&egrave;s en avoir appris les noms.</Q> Mais, 1. N'e&s;t ce
pas donner pour preuve de ce qu'on affirme, cette affirmation m&ecirc;me?
Il n'y a point d'id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es, car il n'y en a que d'acqui&s;es! M.
Locke riroit bien d'un pareil rai&s;onnement, s'il le trouvoit dans &s;es
adver&s;aires. 2. S'il e&s;t vrai qu'on apprend les mots avant que
d'avoir les id&eacute;es qu'ils expriment, au moins s'il e&s;t vrai que cela &s;oit
toujours ain&s;i, comme M. Locke l'entend, je voudrois bien &s;avoir
comment la premi&egrave;re langue a pu &ecirc;tre form&eacute;e? Et m&ecirc;me comment
il e&s;t po&s;&s;ible qu'on fa&s;&s;e comprendre &agrave; quelqu'un le &s;ens d'un mot
nouveau pour lui? Tout homme qui n'a nulle id&eacute;e de <HI>l'ordre,</HI> par
<PB N="317" REF="338">
exemple, doit au&s;&s;i peu &ecirc;tre capable d'entendre ce mot <HI>ordre,</HI> qu'un
aveugle n&eacute; celui de <HI>couleur.</HI></P>
<P>Au &sect; 27, M. Locke nie les id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es, parcequ'elles ne paro&icirc;&s;|&s;ent
ni dans les enfans, ni dans les imb&eacute;cilles, o&ugrave; elles devroient pa|ro&icirc;tre
le plus. Mais, 1. Ceux qui admettent les id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es, ne les
croyent pas plus naturelles &agrave; l'ame, que &s;es facultes; puis donc que
l'&eacute;tat et la con&s;titution du corps nuit &agrave; celles-ci dans les imb&eacute;cilles,
elle &s;era au&s;&s;i cau&s;e qu'on ne leur remarque point les autres. 2. Le
fait m&ecirc;me n'e&s;t pas enti&egrave;rement vrai; les enfans et les imb&eacute;cilles ont
l'id&eacute;e de leur exi&s;tence, de leur individualit&eacute;, de leur identit&eacute;, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Dans le re&s;te de ce &sect;, M. Locke &s;e divertit au depens de ceux qui
croyent que les &eacute;nonc&eacute;s des maximes ab&s;traites &s;ont inn&eacute;es: mais les
plus d&eacute;termin&eacute;s &s;chola&s;tiques n'ont jamais rien dit de &s;emblable, et il
rit d'une chim&egrave;re qu'il s'e&s;t faite lui m&ecirc;me.</P>
<P>Je ne &s;ais, Mon&s;ieur, comment il e&s;t arriv&eacute; qu'au lieu de trois ou
quatre courtes r&eacute;flexions que j'aurois du vous donner &s;ur tout ceci,
<PB N="318" REF="339">
je me &s;uis engag&eacute; dans une critique longue et ennuyeu&s;e, de quel|ques
endroits d'un &s;eul chapitre: c'e&s;t apparemment un re&s;te de

qu'&agrave; pen&s;er tout &s;eul. Prenez patience et pardonnez. J'entrevois bien
des cho&s;es &agrave; dire &s;ur le &s;econd chapitre, o&ugrave; il s'agit des principes inn&eacute;s
de pratique; mais je ne vous en fatiguerai qu'apr&egrave;s en avoir re&ccedil;u

and many per&s;ons die without ever perceiving the truth of the&s;e axioms;
<Q>but it is impo&s;&s;ible,</Q> Mr. Locke ob&s;erves, <Q>for an idea to be in the

whole weight of his rea&s;oning re&s;ts on this la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion; which a&s;&s;ertion
it&s;elf &s;eems to be manife&s;tly contradicted by experience. Do you per|ceive,
Sir, at this moment all the ideas that are in your mind? Are
there not &s;ome of them which you may not, perhaps, take notice of for
many years? In the efforts which we make to recall things to the me|mory,
are we not &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome ideas may be &s;o deeply hidden in its re|ce&s;&s;es,
that in&s;tead of continually perceiving them, we have no &s;mall trouble
in bringing them back to our remembrance? I know that Mr. Locke,
<PB N="312" REF="333">
c. iii. &sect; 20, endeavours to obviate the&s;e objections; but the length and per|plexity
of that article &s;hews that he was not at ea&s;e in writing it. How in|deed
could he be &s;o? &s;ince, as far as I am able to judge, the following is
the re&s;ult of his argument: <Q>I confe&s;s that we have ideas in the mind, of
which we are not con&s;cious; but then the&s;e ideas are in the memory; as
appears from this, that we never recall them without remembering that
they formerly were objects of our perception. But this is not &s;uppo&s;ed to
hold with regard to what are called innate ideas. When the&s;e are perceived
for the fir&s;t time, it is not with remini&s;cence, which would certainly be the
ca&s;e if they had been in the mind before this fir&s;t perception of them,
&amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to tell me, Sir, whether you think that Mr. Locke him&s;elf will
under&s;tood the di&s;tinction which he makes between <HI>being in the mind,</HI> and
<HI>being in the memory?</HI> And of what importance is it, that we remember
to have formerly had the recalled ideas, provided it be allowed that we had
<PB N="313" REF="334">
them long, without taking any notice of them, which is the point in que&s;tion?
Be&s;ides, Mr. Locke ought to have known that innate ideas are not recalled
with remini&s;cence, becau&s;e tho&s;e ideas come originally into the mind in a
way that neither excites nor requires our attention; for whatever Mr. Locke
may &s;ay, every one may be &s;en&s;ible from his own experience, that many
even of his acquired ideas could not have come into his mind independ|ently
of the pre&s;ence of certain objects of which he had never taken any
notice; or, in general, independently of certain unknown cau&s;es, which
enriched him, without his being &s;en&s;ible of it, with ideas that he did not be|lieve
him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, till they actually pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>As to the main que&s;tion, Mr. Locke &s;eems to me perpetually to con|found
two things extremely different; the idea it&s;elf, which is a perception
of the mind, and a principle of rea&s;oning; and the expre&s;&s;ion of that idea
in the form of a propo&s;ition or definition. It is po&s;&s;ible, nay, very probable,
that many per&s;ons have never formed, or thought of the propo&s;ition, <Q>It
<PB N="314" REF="335">
is impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;ame thing to be and not to be at the &s;ame time.</Q>
See Locke, b. i. c. 1. &sect; 12. But does it follow from this, that they are
ignorant of the truth expre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e words? By no means. Every
man who affirms, denies, or &s;peaks; a child who a&s;ks, refu&s;es, or complains,
mu&s;t know the truth of this propo&s;ition. Does it not appear to you, Sir,
that the doctrine of innate ideas may be defended on the &s;ame principle by
which Mr. Locke attacks it; namely, that many per&s;ons have never thought
of the propo&s;itions or de&s;criptions by which they are expre&s;&s;ed? For if with|out
ever having thought of tho&s;e propo&s;itions, they make u&s;e of them in
their rea&s;onings, and employ them in judging of the ju&s;tne&s;s or ab&s;urdity of
every di&s;cour&s;e which they hear, how could they be &s;o familiar with prin|ciples
which they never di&s;tinctly took notice of, unle&s;s they had a natural
knowledge or innate perception of them?</P>
<P>In paragraphs 17 and 18, Mr. Locke denies that our con&s;enting to certain
propo&s;itions at fir&s;t hearing them, is a proof that the ideas expre&s;&s;ed by them
<PB N="315" REF="336">
are innate; &s;ince many propo&s;itions, thus a&s;&s;ented to, evidently expre&s;s
ideas that had been acquired, for example, <HI>two and two make four,</HI> &amp;c.
But does it not appear to you, that he here confounds the definition of words
with &s;elf-evident truths? at lea&s;t, all the examples which he gives are mere
definitions. The idea expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>two and two</HI> is preci&s;ely the &s;ame with
the idea of <HI>four.</HI> Nobody &s;ays that our knowledge of the definitions of
words is innate, becau&s;e that would imply language to be &s;o. But the
knowledge of this truth, that the whole is greater than its part, does not
imply that &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;ince an infant &s;hews it&s;elf acquainted with this
principle, when, di&s;&s;atisfied with the half of an apple, it indicates its de&s;ire
to po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole.</P>
<P>Take the trouble, Sir, to examine &sect; 23; in which Mr. Locke endeavours
to di&s;prove the a&s;&s;ertion, that there are &s;ome principles &s;o truly innate, that
tho&s;e who hear them expre&s;&s;ed in words for the fir&s;t time, immediately com|prehend
<PB N="316" REF="337">
them without learning any thing new. <Q>Fir&s;t of all,</Q> he ob&s;erves,
<Q>it is clear they mu&s;t have learned the terms of the expre&s;&s;ion, and the
meaning of tho&s;e terms.</Q> But here Mr. Locke manife&s;tly departs from
the que&s;tion. Nobody &s;ays that words, which are merely arbitrary &s;igns of
our ideas, are innate. He adds, <Q>that the ideas denoted by the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions
are no more born with us than the expre&s;&s;ions them&s;elves, and that we ac|quire
the ideas after fir&s;t learning the terms by which they are expre&s;&s;ed.</Q>
But, 1. Is not this to take for granted the thing to be proved? There are
no innate ideas, for all ideas are acquired. Mr. Locke would laugh at his
adver&s;aries, were they to make u&s;e of &s;uch an argument. 2. If words are
learned before ideas, at lea&s;t if that is always the ca&s;e, as Mr. Locke un|der&s;tands
it to be, I would be glad to know how the fir&s;t language could
have been formed, or how it could be po&s;&s;ible to communicate to any one
the meaning of a word altogether new to him? A per&s;on who had no idea
<PB N="317" REF="338">
of order, for example, would be no more capable of under&s;tanding the word
order, than a man born blind could under&s;tand the word colour.</P>
<P>In paragraph 27, Mr. Locke denies innate ideas, becau&s;e they are not
found in children and idiots, in whom we ought mo&s;t to expect meeting
with them. I an&s;wer, 1. Tho&s;e who admit innate ideas, do not believe
them more natural to the mind than its faculties; and as the &s;tate and con|&s;titution
of the body di&s;turbs the faculties of idiots, the &s;ame cau&s;e may
hinder them from &s;howing any &s;igns of innate ideas. 2. The fact is not
&s;trictly true. Even idiots and infants have the idea of their exi&s;tence, in|dividuality,
identity, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the remainder of that paragraph, Mr. Locke diverts him&s;elf with the
ab&s;urdity of tho&s;e who believe the expre&s;&s;ions of ab&s;tract maxims to be in|nate;
but the mo&s;t determined &s;chola&s;tic never maintained any &s;uch opinion;
and he combats a chimera which is the work of his own fancy.</P>
<P>I know not how it has happened that, in&s;tead of a few general reflections
which I intended, I have &s;ent you a long and tire&s;ome critici&s;m on &s;ome
<PB N="318" REF="339">
pa&s;&s;ages of a &s;ingle chapter. The remains of la&s;&s;itude, probably, made it
ea&s;ier for me to follow and di&s;pute with Mr. Locke, than to think and
rea&s;on alone. Have patience, and pardon me. There are many remarks
to make on the &s;econd chapter where he treats of innate practical principles.
But I will not tire you with that &s;ubject, unle&s;s you de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>Our new&s;papers &s;ay, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has beat the Au&s;trians, and
killed twenty thou&s;and of their men; with the lo&s;s of fifteen thou&s;and of his
own. This was the object he had in view when he pa&s;&s;ed through Leip&s;ick.
If the news be true, the war mu&s;t become general; and, according to ap|pearances,
it will be terrible. But I much fear le&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty
meet with the fate of Charles XII. What are his re&s;ources for defence
again&s;t the united &s;trength of France and Au&s;tria, and perhaps of Ru&s;&s;ia?</P>
<P>I have the honour to be, with the mo&s;t perfect con&s;ideration, yours, &amp;c.</P>

<P>JE &s;uis charm&eacute; de l'exactitude et de la p&eacute;n&eacute;tration qui &s;e di&s;putent
le terrein dans la derni&egrave;re lettre que vous avez pris la peine de
m'&eacute;crire: et comme vous, Mon&s;ieur, je crois que la que&s;tion touche
&agrave; &s;a d&eacute;ci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Vous avez &s;ans doute rai&s;on de dire que les propo&s;itions &eacute;videntes
dont il s'agit, ne &s;ont pas de &s;imples id&eacute;es, mais des jugemens. Mais
ayez au&s;&s;i la complai&s;ance de reconno&icirc;tre que M. Locke les alleguant
en exemple d'id&eacute;es qui pa&s;&s;ent pour inn&eacute;es et qui ne le &s;ont pas &s;elon
lui, s'il y a i&ccedil;i de la m&eacute;pri&s;e, c'e&s;t lui qu'il faut relever l&agrave;-de&s;&s;us, et
non pas moi, qui n'avois autre cho&s;e &agrave; faire qu'&agrave; refuter &s;a mani&egrave;re
de rai&s;onner contre l'inn&eacute;&iuml;t&eacute; de ces id&eacute;es, ou jugmens l&agrave;. D'ailleurs,
Mon&s;ieur, vous remarquerez, s'il vous plait, que dans cette di&s;pute
il s'agit en e&s;&s;et, de &s;avoir &s;i certaines v&eacute;rit&eacute;s &eacute;videntes et com|munes,
et non pas &s;eulement certaines id&eacute;es &s;imples, &s;ont inn&eacute;es ou
<PB N="320" REF="341">
non. Ceux qui affirment, ne donnent gu&egrave;re pour exemple d'id&eacute;es
&s;imples qui le &s;oyent, que celles de Dieu, de l'unit&eacute;, et de l'exi&s;tence:
les autres exemples &s;ont pris de propo&s;itions completes, que vous
appellez jugemens.</P>
<P>Mais, dites vous, y aura t'il donc des jugemens inn&eacute;s? Le juge|ment
e&s;t il autre cho&s;e qu'un acte de nos facult&eacute;s intellectuelles dans
la comparai&s;on des id&eacute;es? Le jugement &s;ur les v&eacute;rit&eacute;s &eacute;videntes,
n'e&s;t il pas une &s;imple vue de ces v&eacute;rit&eacute;s l&agrave;, un &s;imple coup d'oeil que
l'e&s;prit jette &s;ur elles? J'accorde tout cela. Et de grace, qu'e&s;t ce
qu'<HI>id&eacute;e?</HI> N'e&s;t ce pas <HI>vue,</HI> ou coup d'oeil, &s;i vous voulez? Ceux
qui d&eacute;fini&s;&s;ent l'id&eacute;e autrement, ne s'&eacute;loignent ils pas vi&s;iblement du
&s;ens et de l'intention du mot? Dire que les id&eacute;es &s;ont les e&s;peces
des cho&s;es imprim&eacute;es dans l'e&s;prit, comme l'image de l'objet &s;en&s;ible
trac&eacute;e dans l'oeil, n'e&s;t ce pas jargonner plut&ocirc;t que d&eacute;finir? Or c'e&s;t
la faute, qu'ont fait tous les metaphy&s;iciens, et quoique M. Locke
l'ait bien &s;entie, il a mieux aim&eacute; &s;e f&acirc;cher contre eux, et tirer contre
les girouettes de la place, que s'appliquer &agrave; d&eacute;m&ecirc;ler ce galimatias.
<PB N="321" REF="342">
Que n'a-t'il dit: non &s;eulement il n'y a point d'id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es dans le
&s;ens de ces Me&s;&s;ieurs; mais il n'y a point d'id&eacute;es du tout dans ce &s;ens
l&agrave;: toute id&eacute;e e&s;t un acte, une vue, un coup d'oeil de l'e&s;prit.
D&egrave;s lors demander s'il y a des id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es, c'e&s;t demander s'il y a
certaines v&eacute;rit&eacute;s &s;i &eacute;videntes et &s;i communes que tout e&s;prit non

me paro&icirc;t inconte&s;table, et &s;elon moi, le que&s;tion e&s;t vuid&eacute;e
par l&agrave;.</P>
<P>Maintenant prenez garde, Mon&s;ieur, que cette mani&egrave;re d'entendre
l'affaire, va au but des parti&s;ans des id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es, tout comme la
leur; et par la m&ecirc;me, contredit M. Locke dans le &s;ien. Car pour|quoi
voudroit on qu'il y eu des id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es? C'e&s;t pour en oppo&s;er
la certitude et l'&eacute;vidence au doute univer&s;el des &s;ceptiques, qui e&s;t
ruin&eacute; d'un &s;eul coup, s'il y a des v&eacute;rit&eacute;s dont la vue &s;oit n&eacute;ce&s;&s;aire
et naturelle &agrave; l'homme. Or vous &s;entez, Mon&s;ieur, que je puis
<PB N="322" REF="343">
leur dire cela dans ma fa&ccedil;on d'expliquer la cho&s;e, tout au&s;&s;i bien que
les parti&s;ans ordinaires des id&eacute;es inn&eacute;es dans la leur. Et voil&agrave; ce
qui &s;emble incommoder un peu M. Locke, qui, &s;ans &s;e declarer
pyrrhonien, lai&s;&s;e apper&ccedil;evoir un peu trop de foible pour le pyrrho|ni&s;me,
et a beaucoup contribu&eacute; &agrave; le nourrir dans ce &s;i&egrave;cle. A
force de vouloir marquer les bornes de nos connoi&s;&s;ances, ce qui
&eacute;toit fort n&eacute;ce&s;&s;aire, il a quelquefois tout mis en bornes.</P>
<P>Apr&egrave;s ces remarques g&eacute;n&eacute;rales &s;ur le fond de la que&s;tion, il e&s;t peu
n&eacute;ce&s;&s;aire de s'arr&ecirc;ter &agrave; quelques particuli&egrave;res, o&ugrave; vous ne me croyez
pas fond&eacute;. Cependant vous me permettrez de vous faire ob&s;erver
&s;ur celles que vous relevez: 1. Que dans ce &sect; 5. du ch. 1. il e&s;t
bien vrai que M. Locke m&ecirc;le ces deux cho&s;es, &ecirc;tre actuellement dans
l'e&s;prit, <HI>&s;ans que l'e&s;prit s'en apper&ccedil;oive</HI>&mdash;et, y &ecirc;tre, <HI>&s;ans qu'il s'en &s;oit
jamais apper&ccedil;u.</HI>&mdash;Mais il e&s;t certain au&s;&s;i, qu'&agrave; la conclu&s;ion de ce &sect;,
il s'en tient au premier incognito, et donne lieu &agrave; ma critique en
s'exprimant en ces termes. Je &s;uis la traduction Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e n'ayant
pas l'original. <Q>De &s;orte, dit-il, que &s;outenir qu'une cho&s;e &s;oit
dans l'entendement, et qu'elle n'e&s;t pas con&ccedil;ue par l'entendement,
<PB N="323" REF="344">
qu'elle e&s;t dans l'e&s;prit, &s;ans que l'e&s;prit l'apper&ccedil;oive, c'e&s;t autant
que &s;i l'on di&s;oit, qu'une cho&s;e e&s;t, et n'e&s;t pas dans l'e&s;prit ou
dans l'entendement.</Q> N'e&s;t il pas clair, Mon&s;ieur, que ce grand
philo&s;ophe, &eacute;crivant cela, &eacute;toit dans l'erreur, ou la m&eacute;pri&s;e de fait
que je prends la libert&eacute; de lui reprocher; c'e&s;t que l'e&s;prit ne peut
avoir aucune connoi&s;&s;ance qu'il ne l'apper&ccedil;oive actuellement? Je
crois bien que &s;i on l'avoit d'abord relev&eacute; l&agrave;-de&s;&s;us il auroit &s;enti
&s;a m&eacute;pri&s;e, mais il n'en e&s;t pas moins vrai, et qu'il y e&s;t tomb&eacute;,

<P>2. Vous voulez qu'on lui pa&s;&s;e &s;a di&s;tinction entre les id&eacute;es qui

<HEAD>Mr. ALLAMAND to Mr. GIBBON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BEX, <DATE>October 12, 1756.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am delighted with your la&s;t letter, equally di&s;tingui&s;hed by accuracy and
penetration; and with you, Sir, I believe that the que&s;tion approaches to
its deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>You are right in &s;aying, that the &s;elf-evident propo&s;itions, which I men|tioned,
are not merely ideas, but judgments: yet you will have the good|ne&s;s
to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Locke having given them as examples of ideas
which pa&s;s for being innate, but which he does not regard as &s;uch, the mi&s;|take
is chargeable on him, and not on me, who had nothing farther to do
than to refute his manner of rea&s;oning. Be&s;ides, you will be plea&s;ed to re|mark,
that the real que&s;tion is, whether not only certain ideas, but al&s;o
<PB N="320" REF="341">
certain common and &s;elf-evident propo&s;itions be innate. The only ex|amples
produced of innate ideas are tho&s;e of God, unity, and exi&s;tence;
the other examples are of innate propo&s;itions, which you call judgments.</P>
<P>You a&s;k, whether it be po&s;&s;ible that our judgments &s;hould be innate,
judgment being nothing el&s;e but the act of our intellectual faculties in
comparing our ideas, and our judgment concerning &s;elf-evident truths
being merely the perception of tho&s;e truths by a &s;imple glance of the
mind? I grant all that, but would a&s;k, what el&s;e is an idea but a glance of
the mind? Tho&s;e who define it otherwi&s;e, widely depart from the original
&s;en&s;e of the word; and talk unintelligibly, when they &s;ay that ideas are
&s;pecies; that is, appearances of things impre&s;&s;ed on the mind, as the images
of corporeal objects are impre&s;&s;ed on the eye. All metaphy&s;icians have
committed this mi&s;take; and Mr. Locke, though &s;en&s;ible of it, has cho&s;en
in his anger to direct his batteries again&s;t the weathercocks, rather than
again&s;t the building it&s;elf. According to the meaning of the&s;e metaphy&s;icians,

there are &s;urely no innate ideas, becau&s;e in their &s;en&s;e of the word there are no
ideas whatever. An idea is merely an act or perception of the mind: and
the que&s;tion concerning innate ideas is merely to determine, whether certain
truths be not &s;o common and &s;o evident, that every mind, not ab&s;olutely
&s;tupid, mu&s;t recognize them at a &s;ingle glance, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any
teacher, and without the intervention of any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion or rea&s;oning; and
often without being &s;en&s;ible that this glance is ca&s;t on them? The affirm|ative
appears to me incontrovertible; and the que&s;tion thereby is &s;olved.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to remark, that this way of explaining the matter is as
favourable to innate ideas, and therefore as oppo&s;ite to Mr. Locke's doctrine,
as the unintelligible hypothe&s;is above mentioned. For what rea&s;on do we
contend in favour of innate ideas? To oppo&s;e evidence and certainty to
univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m; who&s;e cau&s;e is ruined by proving certain truths to be
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary and &s;o natural to man, that they are univer&s;ally recognized by
a &s;ingle glance. This may be proved according to my meaning of the word
<PB N="322" REF="343">
idea, as well as according to the &s;en&s;e in which this word is vulgarly taken,
and the proof would not have been very plea&s;ing to Mr. Locke, who, with|out
profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a &s;ceptic, yet &s;hews a leaning to the &s;ceptical &s;ide;
and who&s;e works have contributed much to the diffu&s;ion of &s;ceptici&s;m in the
pre&s;ent age. His too eager de&s;ire of fixing the limits of human knowledge,
a thing highly nece&s;&s;ary, has made him leave nothing but limits.</P>
<P>After the&s;e general ob&s;ervations on the main que&s;tion, it is not very ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to de&s;cend to the particulars in which you think me mi&s;taken. Yet
you will permit me to an&s;wer your objections. 1. It is true, that Mr. Locke,
&sect; 5. c. 1. joins the two expre&s;&s;ions, <Q>being in the mind, without being actu|ally
perceived by the mind,</Q> and <Q>being in the mind, without having ever
been perceived by the mind;</Q> but at the conclu&s;ion of the paragraph he lays
him&s;elf open to my critici&s;m, by expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf as follows: <Q>So that to
be in the under&s;tanding and not to be under&s;tood, to be in the mind and
<PB N="323" REF="344">
never to be perceived, is all one as to &s;ay, any thing is and is not in the
mind or under&s;tanding.</Q> It is clear, Sir, that this great philo&s;opher
erred in writing this pa&s;&s;age; maintaining, what I took the liberty to con|tradict,
that nothing could be in the under&s;tanding without being perceived
to be there. I doubt not that he would have corrected this mi&s;take had it
been pointed out to him; but the certainly falls into it, and employs it as a
principle of rea&s;oning again&s;t his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>2. You think that we ought to admit his di&s;tinction between <Q>ideas in the
mind,</Q> and <Q>ideas in the memory.</Q> I admit the di&s;tinction with all my
heart, provided you take the word idea in the &s;ame acceptation as I do. In that
&s;en&s;e an idea is in the mind, when the mind actually con&s;iders the propo&s;ition
which is the object of its idea, that is, of its glance or perception; and an
idea is in the memory when the mind, having formerly ca&s;t that glance on
it, finds thereby a greater facility in recalling it, remembering at the &s;ame
time that it formerly was the object of its perception. But if you under&s;tand
<PB N="324" REF="345">
by ideas the&s;e chimerical &s;pecies, the mere fictions of metaphy&s;icians, and,
as it &s;eems to me, not &s;ufficiently di&s;proved by Mr. Locke, I return to my
a&s;&s;ertion, and maintain that the di&s;tinction is unintelligible between <Q>being
in the mind,</Q> and <Q>being in the memory.</Q></P>
<P>A violent headach, which I brought with me from our venerable cla&s;s,
hinders me from continuing this letter, or rendering what I have already written
&s;horter and more per&s;picuous. I intreat you to excu&s;e its imperfections.
Your penetration will perhaps di&s;cern how all difficulties may be &s;olved con|cerning
innate practical principles. Mr. Locke treats this &s;ubject better than
he does the others; but in &s;everal parts he is &s;omewhat puzzled.</P>
<P>I rejoiced at the hopes of &s;eeing you for a moment at Vevay, and was
&s;urpri&s;ed at being <HI>di&s;appointed.</HI> If I rightly under&s;tand this word of your
language, it cannot be well tran&s;lated into ours. I met with Mr. Pavillard
only in the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="346">
If the march of an hundred and twenty thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians is not a fable,
what mu&s;t become of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia? Does it not appear to you,
that we are threatened with great revolutions? I have long &s;u&s;pected a de|&s;ign
of reducing the general &s;y&s;tem of Europe to three great empires; that
of the French on the we&s;t of the Rhine, of Au&s;tria on the ea&s;t, and of
Ru&s;&s;ia in the north. Yet we read of nothing of this kind in the Revelation.
But let the world be divided as it may, provided it be lawful for us to believe
that <Q>whatever is, is;</Q> and <Q>that two contradictory propo&s;itions can|not
both at the &s;ame time be true.</Q> Tho&s;e three empires will be great
only when mea&s;ured on this earth; viewed but from the moon, they will be

<P>THOUGH I am Davus, not Oedipus, I will give you my opinion concern|ing
the difficulties in Ju&s;tin, which you propo&s;e for my con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>1. In the third chapter of his &s;econd book he &s;ays, <Q>That A&s;ia was tri|butary
fifteen centuries to the Scythians, and that Ninus put an end to
tho&s;e contributions.</Q> The number of years is &s;o manife&s;tly erroneous,
that it is a&s;toni&s;hing &s;uch a reading &s;hould ever have been admitted into the
text; for it makes Ninus later than Se&s;o&s;tris by a period of fifteen hundred
years. Oro&s;ius, who abridged Ju&s;tin with the greate&s;t fidelity, &s;peaks to the
following purpo&s;e: <Q>The Scythians would have ravi&s;hed the whole of
Egypt, had they not been prevented by the mar&s;hes. When they re|turned
from that country, they made a bloody conque&s;t of A&s;ia, and ren|dered
it tributary. Having remained there fifteen re&s;tle&s;s years, they at
<PB N="327" REF="348">
length returned home, at the earne&s;t intreaty of their wives; who &s;aid,
that unle&s;s their hu&s;bands came home to them, they would, for the &s;ake
of having children, cohabit with their neighbours. <BIBL>Oro&s;ius, lib. i. c. 14.</BIBL></Q>
There cannot be any doubt, therefore, that "fifteen hundred" has been
&s;ub&s;tituted for "fifteen." You inve&s;tigate very ingeniou&s;ly the cau&s;e of the
error; but the emendation which you propo&s;e, by changing <HI>per mille</HI> into
<HI>permi&s;&s;a,</HI> cannot be well founded, if the number was expre&s;&s;ed, as is mo&s;t
probable, by arithmetical marks in the ancient copies.</P>
<P>2. In Ju&s;tin, lib. xii. c. 8. we read, <Q>They (the Macedonians) returned,
after beating the enemy, with congratulations, or thank&s;givings, into the
&s;ame camp.</Q> In this pa&s;&s;age you &s;eem to me needle&s;sly to di&s;turb the
ancient reading. You a&s;&s;ume, without proof, that they did not venture to
attack the Cuphites. Oro&s;ius, Ju&s;tin's faithful interpreter, declares the
direct contrary. <Q>When they came to the country of the Cho&s;ides, they
fought with two hundred thou&s;and of the enemy's cavalry; and, having
conquered them with much difficulty, becau&s;e they them&s;elves were now
worn out with years and fatigue, and &s;unk in &s;pirit, they formed a camp
more magnificent than u&s;ual, to commemorate their exploit. <BIBL>Oro&s;ius,
lib. iii. c. 19.</BIBL></Q> They did not, therefore, return into their camp until they had
<PB N="328" REF="349">
combated and conquered the enemy. Ju&s;tin him&s;elf gives us to under&s;tand
as much, when he &s;ays, <Q>That Alexander, moved by &s;uch ju&s;t prayers,
cau&s;ed, at the end of his <HI>victory,</HI> a camp to be formed, who&s;e walls might
<HI>in&s;pire terror</HI> into the enemy.</Q> If the Macedonians, therefore, as you
imagine, had been frightened at the innumerable forces of the Cuphites, and
therefore returned ha&s;tily into their camp, I do not &s;ee why Ju&s;tin &s;hould
&s;ay, <HI>at the end of his victory, in&s;pire terror into the enemy,</HI> or <HI>that they
returned to their camp with thank&s;givings.</HI> It may here be remarked, in
oppo&s;ition to Sebi&s;ius' emendation, that the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>cum gratulatione,</HI> if
tran&s;lated "with thank&s;givings," will include the <HI>cae&s;is ho&s;tiis,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">;
that is, the <HI>&s;acrifice of thanks;</HI> &s;o that your alteration of <HI>cae&s;is ho&s;tiis</HI>
into <HI>omi&s;&s;is ho&s;tibus,</HI> is equally incon&s;i&s;tent with hi&s;torical truth and the
words of Ju&s;tin.</P>
<P>3. In Ju&s;tin, lib. xxiv. c. viii. we read, <Q>Part of the mountain carried
away by the earthquake overwhelmed the army of the Gauls; and its
thick ma&s;&s;es breaking in &s;cattered pieces, fell down with great force, not
without wounding the enemy.</Q> You need not be offended with the har&s;h
<PB N="329" REF="350">
tran&s;po&s;ition of the word <HI>ho&s;tium,</HI> which you think ought to be joined with
<HI>conferti&s;&s;imi cunei;</HI> as if that la&s;t word meant, the military <HI>cunei,</HI> or wedges,
of the Gauls; whereas it really means the thick ma&s;&s;es detached from the
rock or mountain, which, breaking into &s;maller fragments, fell down and
wounded the enemy, that is, the Gauls. There is no tran&s;po&s;ition therefore
in the ca&s;e; the &s;entence flows in the mo&s;t natural order; and the <HI>conferti&s;&s;imi
cunei</HI> ought not to be joined with <HI>ho&s;tium,</HI> le&s;t the ambiguity of the word <HI>cunei</HI>
&s;hould make it be applied to the military <HI>cunei,</HI> or wedges of men.</P>
<P>4. In Ju&s;tin, lib. xxviii. c. 2. we read <Q>That the Romans could not &s;ave
their city from the Gauls; and when it was taken, in&s;tead of defending it
by the &s;word, had ran&s;omed it with money.</Q> If this pa&s;&s;age required,
or admitted emendation, there is no correction I would adopt more willingly
than yours, which, in&s;tead of <HI>captamque,</HI> &s;ub&s;titutes <HI>capitoliumque.</HI> Shef|ferus
objects, without rea&s;on, that a city <HI>captam,</HI> taken, cannot properly be
&s;aid <HI>defendi &s;erro,</HI> to be defended with the &s;word; for the Roman hi&s;torians
<PB N="330" REF="351">
agree that their city, when taken, was defended, though in a cowardly man|ner.
Oro&s;ius, among others, &s;ays, lib. xi. c. 19. <Q>The Gauls penetrated
into the open city; Rome was now taken; the re&s;t of the youth were
&s;hut up and <HI>be&s;ieged</HI> in the citadel of the Capitoline Mount; where they
were a prey to hunger, pe&s;tilence, terror, and de&s;pair.</Q> You may per|ceive,
therefore, that though the city was taken, its defence was not en|tirely
abandoned; and if it had not been taken, it needed not to have been
ran&s;omed. It &s;eems not to have occurred to you, that your correction im|plies
the Capitol only to have been ran&s;omed, which is not hi&s;torically true.</P>
<P>5. In Ju&s;tin, lib. xxxi. c. 1. we read, <Q>Amba&s;&s;adors were fir&s;t &s;ent by the
Roman &s;enate to per&s;uade Antiochus, King of Syria, that he &s;hould not
make war on the cities of Caele-Syria, which the Egyptians had occupied
in the former war, and which were therefore &s;ubject to Egypt; u&s;ing with
him this argument, that the&s;e cities belonged to a young prince, their
pupil, who had been committed by his father to the protection of the
Romans.</Q> This &s;ame Author, lib. xxx. c. iii. &s;ays, <Q>M. Lepidus was
<PB N="331" REF="352">
&s;ent into Egypt to govern that kingdom, with the title of tutor to the
young king. A &s;econd emba&s;&s;y was &s;ent, after Antiochus had taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e cities, demanding that they &s;hould be re&s;tored; and
without making any mention of the pupil king, merely on this ground,
that the&s;e cities belonged to the Romans by the right of war. <BIBL>Ju&s;tin,
lib. xxxi. c. 1.</BIBL></Q> What this right of war is, in contradi&s;tinction both to war
it&s;elf, and to conque&s;ts made by war, appears from the two following pa&s;|&s;ages,
the fir&s;t of which is part of Quintus Flamininus's &s;peech to the tyrant
Nabis, in Livy, lib. xxxiv. c. 32: <Q>By what mea&s;ures is the friend&s;hip
between &s;tates violated? Principally by the&s;e two; when you treat with
ho&s;tility our allies, and when you make alliance with our enemies. Are
not you guilty of both, &s;ince you, through our ally, have &s;eized, by arms
and violence, Me&s;&s;en&eacute;, a city as much our ally as Lacedemon it&s;elf; and
&s;ince you have entered into an alliance with Philip our enemy?</Q> The
other pa&s;&s;age is in Florus, lib. iii. c. 5. <Q>The King (Mithridates) did
not con&s;ider A&s;ia as a country not belonging to him; but as it had been
formerly taken from him by violence, he &s;ought to recover it by the law
<PB N="332" REF="353">
of war.</Q> I need not mention that "the law of war," in Ju&s;tin, may have
a reference to both the circum&s;tances by which friend&s;hip between &s;tates is
violated; but principally to the attack made on the dominions of Ptolemy,
an ally of the Romans, who de&s;ire him to be rein&s;tated by Antiochus in
his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; for the author immediately adds, that when Antiochus refu&s;ed
to comply, war was denounced again&s;t him.</P>
<P>6. In Ju&s;tin, lib. xxxi. c. 1. we read, <Q>The &s;enate, therefore, wrote to
Flamininus, that if it &s;eemed expedient to him, as he had delivered Ma|cedon
from Philip, &s;o he &s;hould deliver Greece from Nabis.</Q> The glory
of Flamininus, the general in the Macedonian war, is &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted
by the words of the &s;enate's decree, in Livy, lib. xxxiii. c. 32. <Q>The &s;e|nate
and Roman people, and L. Quintius the general, having conquered
king Philip and the Macedonians, declare free and independent republics,
the Corinthians,</Q> &amp;c. Florus, lib. ii. c. 12. &s;ays, <Q>Per&s;eus &s;ucceeded his
father Philip, and did not think it becoming the dignity of Macedon, that it
&s;hould remain in &s;ubjection, in con&s;equence of being defeated in one war.</Q>
You a&s;k, whether Quintius, who conquered Macedon, can be &s;aid, in any
&s;en&s;e, to have delivered it from Philip, although it appears that Philip was
<PB N="333" REF="354">
really not deprived of that kingdom? and whether, if the Roman general con|quered
Nabis, as he had already conquered Philip, he did not thereby free
Greece? The&s;e difficulties are &s;olved by Ju&s;tin, lib. xxx. c. 4. <Q>The
fortune of the Romans conquered the Macedonians; &s;o that Philip, after
his defeat, having obtained peace from the con&s;ul Flamininus, pre&s;erved
indeed the name of king, but kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion only of Macedon, having
lo&s;t all tho&s;e cities of Greece, which, like &s;cattered members of the Ma|cedonian
kingdom, lay beyond its ancient boundaries.</Q> In the letters,
therefore, of the Roman &s;enate to the con&s;ul Flamininus, Marcedon &s;ignifies
not the country &s;trictly &s;o called, which alone was not taken from Philip,
but that part of Greece which lay beyond the original limits of Macedon;
to which is oppo&s;ed the re&s;t of Greece, which was then hara&s;&s;ed by Nabis,
but which had never been &s;ubject to Macedon. Hence the meaning of the
&s;enate appears to have been, that Quintius, as he had delivered Macedonia,
that is, the part of Greece belonging to Macedon, from Philip, &s;o he &s;hould
<PB N="334" REF="355">
deliver the re&s;t of Greece from Nabis, who had actually made him&s;elf ma&s;ter
nearly of the whole of that country.</P>
<LG>
<L>This is not merely a conjecture &s;age,</L>
<L>But truth as certain as the Sibyl's page.</L>

<P>THOSE who apply them&s;elves to critici&s;m ought to be cautious in conjec|tural
emendation, and diligent in cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudy, that they may perceive
what va&s;t application this critical art requires, and how ra&s;hly tho&s;e behave,
who immediately alter a pa&s;&s;age which they do not at fir&s;t &s;ight under&s;tand,
or which &s;eems to them incon&s;i&s;tent with their rules of grammar or logic.
This ra&s;hne&s;s is ju&s;tly reprehended by many, and particularly by the illu&s;tri|ous
Burman, in his valuable preface to Phaedrus; which, as I have always
made it the rule by which my own critical labours have been directed, &s;o I
would warmly recommend it to all tho&s;e who pur&s;ue the &s;ame walk of litera|ture.
<PB N="335" REF="356">
Having made this preparatory ob&s;ervation, I proceed to the diffi|culties
in Ju&s;tin, about which &s;o much learning has been employed.</P>
<P>1. The emendation of the manife&s;tly corrupt pa&s;&s;age in lib. ii. c. 3. &sect; 18.
(a corruption depending on numbers, and therefore as natural as frequent,)
which corrects the error by changing fifteen hundred into fifteen, mu&s;t be
approved by all judicious critics. The cau&s;e which introduced the faulty
reading into the text is uncertain; and the que&s;tion that has been &s;o indu&s;|triou&s;ly
agitated concerning it, appears to me more curious than u&s;eful, &s;ince
the error might have originated in a thou&s;and different fources. The cor|rupt
reading runs thus: "A&s;ia was tributary to the Scythians fifteen hundred
years." We agree that it &s;hould be corrected thus: "A&s;ia was tributary
to the Scythians fifteen years." But in the corrupt text you think that
ob&s;cure traces of the genuine reading may be di&s;cerned, and imagine that
<HI>per mille</HI> had crept into the text, in&s;tead of <HI>permi&s;&s;a;</HI> explaining the pa&s;|&s;age
as if "A&s;ia had been permitted to be tributary to the Scythians for fif|teen
years." I ob&s;erved that this emendation, for which I &s;ee not any ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
is rendered highly improbable, becau&s;e in ancient manu&s;cripts the
<PB N="336" REF="357">
names of numbers are expre&s;&s;ed, not by words, but by letters u&s;ed as nu|meral
marks; and though they are &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed by words, yet this
is not frequent, e&s;pecially in works of hi&s;tory. This a&s;&s;ertion is confirmed
by innumerable te&s;timonies; I &s;hall be contented with referring to that of
Galen de Antidot. I.&mdash;It is a &s;ubject indeed both of &s;urpri&s;e and grief, that
this part of critici&s;m, which con&s;i&s;ts in a&s;certaining exactly the rules of nu|meral
notation, &s;hould not have met with due attention; although thereby
the ra&s;hne&s;s of wild conjecture would be greatly re&s;trained, and more cer|tainty
might be attained in determining the age and authenticity of manu&s;cripts.
But let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that your correction were &s;afe on this &s;ide, yet it
would be de&s;troyed by the pa&s;&s;age which you your&s;elf quote from Ju&s;tin;
<Q>That Se&s;o&s;tris being put to flight by the Scythians, left behind him his
<PB N="337" REF="358">
army and baggage.</Q> The hi&s;torian having ob&s;erved, in &sect; 15, that the
Scythians, after returning from the pur&s;uit of the king, rendered A&s;ia,
which they had &s;ubdued, tributary; how is it po&s;&s;ible that, in &sect; 18, he
&s;hould &s;ay that this happened not in con&s;equence of their own military &s;uc|ce&s;s,
but in con&s;equence of the permi&s;&s;ion of Se&s;o&s;tris? We are not now
inquiring what is hi&s;torically true, but what is Ju&s;tin's report; which mu&s;t
not be &s;uppo&s;ed incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf.</P>
<P>2. If we here con&s;ult Arrian, he tells us merely that <Q>Alexander pro|ceeded
to the river Hypha&s;is, with a view to conquer the Indians who
lived beyond it; but that the Macedonians, then perceiving there was
no end to their labours, refu&s;ed to advance; and finally prevailed on
Alexander, through the earne&s;t intreaty of Coenus, to prepare for his
return; &s;ince every thing &s;eemed adver&s;e to his farther progre&s;s. Then
Alexander erected twelve great altars, as monuments of his conque&s;ts.</Q>
Arrian &s;ays nothing about the Cuphites, the camp, or the two hundred
thou&s;and hor&s;emen, who &s;o much terrified the Macedonians. Curtius
lib. ix. c. 2 and 3, relates, <Q>that Alexander, when he came to the Hy|pha&s;is,
<PB N="338" REF="359">
di&s;covered that the farther bank was inhabited by the Gangaridae
and Pharra&s;ii; that their king, with twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e and two hun|dred
thou&s;and foot, meant to ob&s;truct his pa&s;&s;age; being furni&s;hed be&s;ides
with two thou&s;and chariots and three thou&s;and elephants; which la&s;t formed
the mo&s;t alarming part of his &s;trength. The Macedonians then refu&s;ed
to follow the king farther; and obtained, through Coenus' entreaty, that
preparations &s;hould be made for their return home.</Q> He &s;ubjoins;
<Q>Alexander came forth on the third day, and ordered twelve altars of
&s;quare &s;tone to be erected as a monument of his expedition, and the for|tifications
of his camp to be enlarged, and beds of a gigantic &s;ize to be
con&s;tructed, that by diffu&s;ing an air of va&s;tne&s;s on every object around
him, he might excite the credulous wonder of po&s;terity.</Q> Plutarch,
in his treati&s;e concerning the fortune of Alexander, &s;peaks to the &s;ame
purpo&s;e. By comparing the&s;e authors with Ju&s;tin, the reader will perceive
that he differs from them all in &s;everal e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tances; and parti|cularly
in &s;aying that Alexander had two motives for enlarging the fortifi|cations
of his camp; one of which regarded the enemy, and the other had
<PB N="339" REF="360">
a relation to po&s;terity. <Q>Moved by &s;uch ju&s;t prayers, he ordered a camp to
be built more magnificent than u&s;ual, as at the end of his victory; that its
fortifications might be an object of terror to the enemy, and of admiration
to po&s;terity. <BIBL>Ju&s;tin, <HI>ibid.</HI> &sect; 16.</BIBL></Q> The other hi&s;torians are totally &s;ilent
as to what regards the enemy; which is favourable to that reading of Ju&s;tin
which on the faith of manu&s;cripts &s;tands in his text, and extremely adver&s;e
to your emendation. For "the end of his victory" mu&s;t refer to &s;ome re|cent
victory, and not to his victories in general; otherwi&s;e Ju&s;tin, as you
acknowledge, would have &s;aid, "the end of his victories," as in &sect; 10.
above, "wearied, not le&s;s by the number of his victories, than by his
toils." As to Alexander's &s;econd motive, concerning which all other
hi&s;torians are &s;ilent, "that his fortifications might be an object of terror to
the enemy;" there would not &s;urely be any room for it, on the &s;uppo&s;ition
that he had determined to move his camp, and leave the country, without
fighting a battle. The Cuphites could not be &s;eized with alarm at &s;eeing
the monuments of the exploits of a man who had not ventured to engage
with their army; nor, on that &s;uppo&s;ition, would there be any mention of
<PB N="340" REF="361">
victory, terror, or &s;acrifices of thanks; for that the word <HI>gratulatio</HI> refers
to the &s;olemn victims &s;acrificed in gratitude for &s;ucce&s;s, and frequently men|tioned
by Arrian, cannot be doubtful to tho&s;e conver&s;ant with ancient writers.
Be&s;ides, the word <HI>omi&s;&s;is</HI> including the idea of &s;omething begun or neglected,
does not plea&s;e me, nor &s;eem conformable with Ju&s;tin's &s;tyle. Your prolix
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion concerning the age, de&s;ign, and character of Oro&s;ius has but little
connection with the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. It is univer&s;ally acknowledged, that he
&s;o clo&s;ely, or rather &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly, follows Ju&s;tin's foot&s;teps, that he fre|quently
expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the &s;ame words and phra&s;es; and it has long
ago been proved by good critics, that Ju&s;tin's text, &s;uch as it &s;tood in the
copy u&s;ed by Oro&s;ius, may in innumerable places be re&s;tored by an attention
to the latter writer. He mu&s;t be blind indeed, who does not perceive that
in the pa&s;&s;age before us Oro&s;ius mu&s;t have copied Ju&s;tin. Whence could he
otherwi&s;e have derived the name <HI>Cho&s;idum,</HI> or <HI>Cuphitum,</HI> which is not men|tioned
by any other hi&s;torian? and if that be the ca&s;e, Oro&s;ius mu&s;t have
<PB N="341" REF="362">
found in his original, not that "the enemy were omitted," but that "they
were beat;" in which &s;en&s;e Ju&s;tin ought to be interpreted.</P>
<P>4. I grant that a town taken by a &s;iege cannot be &s;aid to be defended by
its own walls. But may it not be defended by troops in the citadel? When
the enemy are obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of the citadel, the town may thereby
be delivered from all danger. The expre&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t, might be u&s;ed by
an author fond of antithe&s;is and amplification.</P>
<P>5. Your new conjecture concerning the towns of Syria which the Romans
acquired by the law of war, would &s;olve the difficulty, were not that con|jecture
built on an anachroni&s;m. For the league entered into with the am|ba&s;&s;adors
of Antiochus, who came to crave peace, which you find in Livy,
lib. xxxviii. c. 37. was not prior, but &s;ub&s;equent, to Antiochus's expedition
into Egypt, mentioned in Ju&s;tin, lib. xxxi. c. 1. You may con&s;ider whether
the following words of Livy do not refer to this &s;ubject: <Q>After this,
Quintius and his ten lieutenants received the amba&s;&s;adors of kings,
<PB N="342" REF="363">
nations, and cities. Tho&s;e of king Antiochus were fir&s;t introduced.
They &s;aid the &s;ame things as formerly, when at Rome, without gaining
belief; and they were now told, not in the ambiguous language which the
Romans had u&s;ed before the defeat of Philip, and while their own for|tune
was &s;till doubtful, but in expre&s;s terms, that Antiochus mu&s;t evacuate
all the cities of A&s;ia, which had belonged either to Philip or to Ptolemy.</Q>
Livy, lib. xxxiii. c. 34; with which compare c. 39 and 40. Be &s;atisfied with
this authority. Farewell and pro&s;per.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH I had long dedicated my&s;elf, and had purpo&s;ed to &s;pend my

commend your &s;agacity and genius, which require rather the rein than the
&s;pur; and I earne&s;tly wi&s;h that you were accompanied in this literary walk by a
&s;cholar of more cultivated ta&s;te, and more copious erudition, than my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="365">
You employ many arguments in defending your emendation of Ju&s;tin,
lib. xii. c. 8. &sect; 17; where, in&s;tead of "the enemy being bear," you &s;ub&s;ti|tute
"the enemy being omitted." I formerly gave you my rea&s;ons for re|jecting
this emendation, and &s;hall not repeat them here, nor enter into a
particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the an&s;wers which you make to my objections. Thus
much only in general I will ob&s;erve, that the reading in the text, which is
approved by the con&s;enting authority of the manu&s;cripts, mu&s;t be acknow|ledged
to contain a very natural meaning, conveyed in good Latin, and in
Ju&s;tin's &s;tyle. This reading, indeed, makes mention of a battle with the
Cuphites, concerning which the other hi&s;torians of Alexander are &s;ilent.
But ought this &s;ilence to make us alter Ju&s;tin's text, e&s;pecially as none of
tho&s;e hi&s;torians deny &s;uch a battle to have happened? If &s;uch licence be
<PB N="345" REF="366">
indulged to critics, that they may expunge or alter the words of an hi&s;|toriam,
becau&s;e he is the &s;ole relater of a particular event, we &s;hall leave
few materials for authentic hi&s;tory. Two rea&s;ons &s;trongly militate again&s;t
your correction: the fir&s;t, that if it be admitted, there will no longer be any
con&s;i&s;tency in Ju&s;tin's narrative; and the whole clau&s;e mu&s;t be expunged
which mentions the return of the Macedonians into their camp; which, if
they did not mean to fight, it was not nece&s;&s;ary for them to leave. The
&s;econd rea&s;on is, that the phra&s;e <HI>omittere ho&s;tes,</HI> though frequently u&s;ed by
Ju&s;tin, is never, that I know, applied by him in the &s;en&s;e which you give
to it. The generals entitled to direct military mea&s;ures are &s;aid <HI>omittere
ho&s;tes;</HI> but never the &s;oldiers, who&s;e duty it is to obey orders; and who, in
the pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration, reque&s;t that they may not be ordered to
renew the engagement with the enemy. To this may be added, that where|ever
this phra&s;e, <HI>omi&s;&s;is ho&s;tibus,</HI> occurs in Ju&s;tin, it denotes not an end, but
only a change, of the war. Turn to the pa&s;&s;age which you formerly referred
<PB N="346" REF="367">
to, lib. xxvii. c. 3. &sect; 6. <Q>They left off fighting again&s;t their foreign ene|my,
and made war on each other:</Q> to which you will find a parallel in
lib. xxix. c. 2. &sect; 7. <Q>By this oration he prevailed with Philip to leave
off fighting again&s;t the Etolians, and to make war on the Romans.</Q> But
it is &s;ufficient that Oro&s;ius read <HI>cae&s;is ho&s;tibus</HI> in the copies of Ju&s;tin which
he made u&s;e of. If, by &s;aying <HI>omi&s;&s;is ho&s;tibus,</HI> Oro&s;ius confirmed your con|jecture,
the reading in the text would be doubtful indeed.</P>
<P>I have nothing farther to add to my ob&s;ervations concerning the cities of
Syria which the Romans acquired by the right of war.</P>
<P>That we may not harp on the old &s;tring, but have new matter for our
friendly conte&s;t, you rai&s;e a difficulty concerning the fir&s;t con&s;ul&s;hip of Ju|lius
Cae&s;ar; which happened on the fir&s;t of January, in the &s;ix hundred and
ninety-fifth year of Rome, and in the forty-fir&s;t of his age; although by
the laws a&s;certaining the age of candidates, no per&s;on was entitled to crave
that honour before his forty-third year. But this law, which was propo&s;ed
by Villius, appears not, any more than other laws appertaining to the &s;ame
object, to have been of perpetual authority; as we learn, both from the
<PB N="347" REF="368">
Roman hi&s;torians and from the con&s;ular Fa&s;ti. Livy, lib. viii. c. 4, &s;ays, that
in the con&s;ul&s;hip of C. Marius Rutilus and Q. Servilius Ahala, it was pro|vided
by a law of the people, that no per&s;on &s;hould bear the &s;ame magi&s;tracy
twice in the &s;pace of ten years. But this law &s;eems either not to have been
confirmed, or not to have remained in force: for we afterwards find both in
the Falti and in Livy, that T. Manlius Torquatus was a &s;econd time con&s;ul
in the &s;pace of four years; M. Valerius Corvus, in eight; and L. Papirius
Cra&s;&s;us, in &s;ix: L. Papirius Cur&s;or was four times con&s;ul in eight years:
which things are incon&s;i&s;tent with this law. To this &s;ubject may be referred
what Dio Ca&s;&s;ius &s;ays concerning another law of the &s;ame kind, in his fortieth
book, &s;ect. 56. <Q>Pompey re&s;tored the law of the Comitia, which prohi|bited
any per&s;on from being elected into any office of magi&s;tracy in his
ab&s;ence; a law which had fallen into total di&s;u&s;e; and confirmed another,
which had been a &s;hort time before enacted by the &s;enate, forbidding any
man who had been a magi&s;trate in the city to command in any foreign
province before the expiration of five years. Yet Pompey, who had ju&s;t
pa&s;t the&s;e laws, was not a&s;hamed to accept his command in Spain for five
<PB N="348" REF="369">
years longer; and to grant, by the &s;ame decree, to Cae&s;ar (who&s;e friends
impatiently brooked &s;uch regulations) the permi&s;&s;ion of being candidate
for the con&s;ul&s;hip in his ab&s;ence, &amp;c.</Q> That the law propo&s;ed by Villius
was not uniformly ob&s;erved, appears from Cicero's oration again&s;t Rullus;
where the orator boa&s;ts that he was the fir&s;t man, not graced by ancient no|bilty,
who had obtained the con&s;ul&s;hip in the year that he was entitled to
&s;olicit it: but this pa&s;&s;age does not inform us what was the force of Villius's
law, when the candidates were patricians of ancient family, or men of con|&s;ular
dignity. Dolabella certainly, after Cae&s;ar's murder, &s;eized the con&s;ul&s;hip,
when only twenty-five years old, as we are informed by Appian: on which
&s;ubject Dio Ca&s;&s;ius, lib. xliv. &sect; 22, &s;ays, that Dolabella intruded him&s;elf

<P>CHEZ les Romains, ce peuple g&eacute;n&eacute;reux, qui nous a lai&s;&s;&eacute; tant de

longs travaux avoient rendus les oracles du barreau, ne &s;e croyoient

voudrois la r&eacute;tablir cette coutume excellente, et la tran&s;porter m&ecirc;me
dans les autres &s;ciences. Quiconque canno&icirc;t tant &s;oit peu vos
ouvrages et votre r&eacute;putation, ne vous refu&s;era pas, je pen&s;e, le titre
d'un des premi&egrave;res litt&eacute;rateurs du &s;iecle, et je ne crois pas qu'une
folle pr&eacute;&s;omption m'&eacute;gare, lor&s;que je m'attribue quelques di&s;po&s;itions
&agrave; r&eacute;u&s;&s;ir dans les Belles Lettres. Votre commerce pourroit m'&ecirc;tre
d'une grande utilit&eacute;. Voil&agrave; mon &s;eul titre pour vous le demander.

vous demander des &eacute;clairci&s;&s;emens &s;ur quelques difficultes, et des d&eacute;|ci&s;ions

<P>1. Qui &eacute;toit ce Pi&s;on le Pere, &agrave; qui Horace addre&s;&s;e &s;on art
po&eacute;tique? M. Dacier croit que c'&eacute;toit ce L. Pi&s;on le pontife qui tri|ompha

&eacute;crivit &s;on art po&eacute;tique avant l'an 734, pui&s;qu'il y parle de Virgile, qui
mourut dans cette ann&eacute;e, d'une fa&ccedil;on &agrave; faire bien comprendre qu'il

<P>Ce qui ne peut gu&egrave;res convenir qu'&agrave; un jeune homme de dix huit, &agrave;
vingt ans. Mais ce L. Pi&s;on ne pouvoit point avoir dans ce tems la
un fils au&s;&s;i ag&eacute;. Il mourut en 785, ag&eacute; de quatre vingt ans<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Tacit. ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>. Il
<PB N="353" REF="374">
naquit donc en 705, et il n'avoit que trente ans tout au plus, quand
cette &eacute;pitre fut &eacute;crite. Je vois a&s;&s;ez clairement, que ce ne pouvoit pas
&ecirc;tre l&agrave; le Pi&s;on que nous cherchons; mais, parmi un a&s;&s;ez grand
nombre de per&s;onnages du &s;iecle d'Augu&s;te qui portoient ce nom, je
voudrois qu'on m'aidat &agrave; trouver celui &s;ur qui les &s;oup&ccedil;ons peuvent
tomber avec quelque vrai&s;emblance.</P>
<P>2. Vous &s;avez combein les critiques &s;e &s;ont donn&eacute;s de peine, pour
rechercher le vrai but qu'avoit Horace dans la troi&s;i&egrave;me ode du troi|&s;i&egrave;me
livre. La grandeur des id&eacute;es, et la noble&s;&s;e des expre&s;&s;ions y
font &s;entir partout la main de ma&icirc;tre: mais on e&s;t &agrave; la fois fach&eacute; et
&s;urpris d'y voir que le commencement ne &s;e lie point avec la &s;uite,
que la harangue de Junon paro&icirc;t ne tenir &agrave; rien, et n'aboutir &agrave; rien;
et apr&egrave;s avoir admir&eacute; cette ode par parties, on ne peut gu&egrave;res s'em|p&ecirc;cher
d'en condamner l'en&s;emble. Taneguy le Fevre l'avoit ex|pliqu&eacute;e
par un &s;y&s;t&ecirc;me que M. Dacier trouve m&eacute;riter autant d'&eacute;loges
que l'ode elle m&ecirc;me, et qui en effet me paro&icirc;t des plus jolis. Vous
&s;avez qu'il le fonde &s;ur la crainte qu'il pr&ecirc;te au peuple Romain de
<PB N="354" REF="375">
voir transf&eacute;rer &agrave; Ilium le &s;iege de l'empire; et qu'il &s;uppo&s;e qu'Horace
compo&s;a cette ode dans la vue de d&eacute;tourner Augu&s;te de ce de&s;&s;ein, en
lui rappellant tout la part que les Dieux avoient eu &agrave; la de&s;truction de
cette ville, et combien le mortel qui o&s;eroit la reb&acirc;tir s'expo&s;eroit &agrave;
tout le courroux de ces m&ecirc;mes Dieux. Le peuple pouvoit d'autant
plus facilement &s;uppo&s;er ce de&s;&s;ein &agrave; ce prince, que &s;on pere adoptif
en avoit &eacute;t&eacute; &s;oupc&ccedil;onn&eacute;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. i. c. 79.</NOTE>. Mais je doute que ce fy&s;t&ecirc;me pui&s;&s;e &s;e

peuple Romain, qui &s;on m&ecirc;mes &s;ans vrai&s;emblance; Augu&s;te &s;e
di&s;tingua toujours par les &s;oins particuliers qu'il donna &agrave; la ville de
Rome, qui devoient ra&s;&s;urer le peuple contre toutes les craintes d'une
pareille e&s;pece. On peut en voir le d&ecirc;tail dans la vie d'Augu&s;te par
Suetone, c. 28, 29, 30. Je n'en marquerai que deux: il engagea la
plus part des grands &agrave; orner la ville, par des b&acirc;timens &s;uperbes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vell. Paterculus, L. ii. c. 89.</NOTE>, et il
b&acirc;tit un Temple &agrave; Mars le Vengeur, o&ugrave; il ordonna que le &s;&eacute;nat s'a&s;|&s;embleroit
toutes les fois qu'il &s;eroit que&s;tion de guerres ou de tri|omphes<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 29.</NOTE>.
Sont ce la les actions d'un homme qui &s;onge &agrave; &s;e faire

ce fut vers la fin de &s;a vie qu'il dut concevoir ce projet,

d&eacute;marches folles et mal entendues, qu'Augu&s;te &s;e piqua toujours
d'&eacute;viter avec &s;oin. La &s;age opini&acirc;tret&eacute; avec laquelle il refu&s;a tou|jours
la dictature, peut &s;ervir de preuve &agrave; ce que je dis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 52. Vell. Patercul. L. ii. c. 89.</NOTE>. Voila
les rai&s;ons qui m'emp&ecirc;chent d'acquie&s;cer au &s;y&s;t&ecirc;me de Taneguy le

&s;ans doute, et qui en applanira &eacute;galement les difficult&eacute;s.</P>
<P>3. Antiochus, roi de Syrie, avoit pris plu&s;ieurs villes de la Coele|Syrie
et de la Pale&s;tine au jeune Ptol&eacute;m&eacute;e, alors &s;ous la tutelle des
Romains. Ceux ci prennent la d&eacute;fen&s;e de leur &eacute;leve, et ordonnent
au roi de Syrie de les rendre. Il m&eacute;pri&s;e ces ordres, et les retient.
Sur quoi on lui envoye une &s;econde amba&s;&s;ade, laquelle lai&s;&s;ant de
c&ocirc;t&eacute; les pr&eacute;ten&s;ions du jeune prince, lui ordonna de rendre des villes,
<PB N="356" REF="377">

qui nous jettent dans une difficult&eacute; embara&s;&s;ante. On ne con&ccedil;oit pas
comment les Romains pouvoient avoir acquis des villes dans la Syrie,
et dans l'Egypte, pui&s;que, bien loin d'y avoir fait des conqu&ecirc;tes,
ils ne porterent leurs armes en A&s;ie que plu&s;ieurs ann&eacute;es apr&egrave;s cette

d'Egypte avant ce tems<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. Liv. Epitom. L. iv. Eutrop. L. ii. Valer. Maxim. L. iv. c. 3.</NOTE> mais c'&eacute;toit un pur trait&eacute; d'alliance et
d'amiti&eacute; qui ne fut pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute; ni &s;uivi d'aucune guerre. J'ai cru que
l'examen des autres hi&s;toriens, qui ont racont&eacute; ces m&ecirc;mes &eacute;venemens,

<P>4. Un different que Scaliger et I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius ont eu en&s;emble, &s;ur
la veritable &eacute;poque de la mort du po&euml;te Catulle, a fait beaucoup de
bruit dans la republique des lettres. Je n'ai point eu en main les
pieces du proc&egrave;s, &s;avoir les &eacute;ditions de Catulle de ces deux hommes
c&eacute;lebres; mais Bayle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bayle Dictionnaire Critique, art. Catulle.</NOTE> nous a donn&eacute; un extrait fort d&eacute;taill&eacute; de leur
di&s;pute, y ajoutant &s;&eacute;s propres r&eacute;flexiens. Je &s;uis fach&eacute; de ne pou|voir
pas remonter aux &s;ources; mais dans la n&eacute;ce&s;&s;it&eacute; de me &s;ervir de

<P>Quoique deux habiles litt&eacute;rateurs &s;e &s;oient exerc&eacute;s &s;ur cette que&s;|tion,
je &s;uis bien loin de la regarder comm&eacute; parfaitement &eacute;claircie.
Vo&s;&s;ius me paro&icirc;t avoir trop avanc&eacute; le mort du po&euml;te, Scaliger l'a
certainement trop recul&eacute;e. Catulle ne mourut pas bien &s;urement
A. U. C. 696; mais il ne ve&ccedil;ut pas non plus ju&s;qu'aux jeux &s;&eacute;culaires

<P>Catulle parle de la Grande Bretagne et de &s;es habitans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Catull. Carm. xi. &amp;c.</NOTE>, or
C&eacute;&s;ar fut le premier qui fit conno&icirc;tre cette i&s;le aux Romains<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tacit. in Vit. Agricol. C. 13.</NOTE>, et

Scaliger pour prouver qu'il fut &s;pectateur des triomphes de C&eacute;&s;ar,

en d&eacute;tail &s;i les paroles <HI>paterna prima lancinata &s;unt bona,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Idem, xxvii. ver. 29.</NOTE>
conviennent mieux aux premi&egrave;res victoires de C&eacute;&s;ar qu'aux der|ni&egrave;res,
parceque je crois qu'il n'y e&s;t que&s;tion ni des unes ni des
autres. Il n'y a qu'&agrave; lire cette &eacute;pigramme avec quelque attention
<PB N="359" REF="380">
pour voir que Catulle s'addre&s;&s;e toujours &agrave; C&eacute;&s;ar dans la &s;econde
per&s;onne:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Cinoede Romule, haec videbis et feres?</L>
<L>"Es impudicus, et vorax, et helluo."</L>

<L>"Parum expatravit? an parvum helluatus e&s;t?</L>
<L>"Paterna prima lancinata &s;unt bona.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Il n'y e&s;t donc nullement que&s;tion des di&s;&s;ipations de C&eacute;&s;ar, mais
de celle de Mamurra; et toutes les con&s;&eacute;quences qu'on en peut tirer
par rapport aux triomphes de celui la, &s;ont ill&eacute;gitimes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cependant &s;i l'on avoit la curio&s;it&eacute; de rechercher l'&eacute;poque pr&eacute;ci&s;e de la compo&s;i|tion de cette &eacute;pigramme, un pa&s;&s;age de Cic&eacute;ron nous conduiroit &agrave; la fixer vers l'an 708. Car quoiqu'en di&s;e Bayle, on ne peut gu&egrave;res entendre ce pa&s;&s;age que d'une piece &s;aty|rique faite contre Mamurra; au&s;&s;i bien le &s;avant Dr. Middleton a t'il embra&s;&s;&eacute; cette opi|nion. Il e&s;t inutile de dire que Catulle n'auroit jamais o&s;&eacute; compo&s;er cette &eacute;pigramme contre C&eacute;&s;ar alors tout pui&s;&s;ant. Le cl&eacute;mence de C&eacute;&s;ar envers &s;es ennemis &eacute;toit a&s;&s;ez connue; la fa&ccedil;on m&ecirc;me, dont les anciens parlent de la mod&eacute;ration dont C&eacute;&s;ar u&s;a envers le &s;atyrique, &s;emble &s;uppo&s;er qu'il avoit alors la pui&s;&s;ance en main, pui&s;qu'auparavant &s;a cl&eacute;|mence auroit eu peu de m&eacute;rite.

Or on ne peut pas douter qu'Augu&s;te ne fut &s;ouverain alors.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="381">
D'un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, Catulle ne ve&ccedil;ut pas ju&s;qu'aux jeux &s;&eacute;culaires
d'Augu&s;te, pui&s;qu'il mourut avant Tibulle. Ovide, dans l'&eacute;l&eacute;gie qu'il
&s;it expr&egrave;s &s;ur la mort de ce dernier, met Catulle parmi les po&euml;tes, que
&s;on ami devoit recontrer &agrave; &s;a de&s;cente dans les Champs Elys&eacute;es:</P>

<L>"Tempora, cum Calvo, docte Catulle tuo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ovid. Eleg. L. iii. 9.</NOTE>."</L>
</LG>
<P>Mais dans quel tems Tibulle mourut il? Une petite &eacute;pigramme
de Domitius Marius nous l'apprend: le m&ecirc;me jour, ou du moins la
m&ecirc;me ann&eacute;e, que Virgile:</P>
<LG>

</LG>
<P>Or per&s;onne n'ignore que Virgile mourut le 22 Septembre 734<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Vit. Virgil.</NOTE>.
Il e&s;t donc clair que Catulle, d&eacute;ja mort dans ce tems la, ne vit point
les jeux &s;&eacute;culaires qui ne &s;e c&eacute;l&eacute;brerent qu'en 736.</P>
<P>Avan&ccedil;ons plus loin, et di&s;ons, que Catulle &eacute;toit d&eacute;ja mort avant
721. Je me fonde &s;ur le t&eacute;moignage d'un hi&s;torien contemporain,
<PB N="361" REF="382">
ami de Cic&eacute;ron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. i. c. 55. Vo&s;&s;. de Hi&s;t. Latin. L. i. c. 24.</NOTE> et de Catulle lui m&ecirc;me<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Catull. Carm. i.</NOTE>; en un mot de Cornelius
Nepos. Il faut le d&eacute;velopper ce t&eacute;moignage. Dans la vie d'Atticus,
que cet &eacute;crivain nous a lai&s;&s;&eacute;e, parlant d'un certain L. Julius Calidius,
&agrave; qui Atticus rendit de grands &s;ervices, il ajoute pour le faire
mieux conno&icirc;tre, <HI>quem po&s;t Lucretii Catullique mortem, multo clegan|ti&s;&s;imum
poetam, no&s;tram tuli&s;&s;e aetatem vere videor po&s;&s;e contendere</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cornel. Nepos, in Vit. Attici, c. 12.</NOTE>.
Catulle &eacute;toit donc mort lor&s;que Nepos &eacute;crivit ce pa&s;&s;age. Mais ne
pourroit on pas fixer le tems de &s;a compo&s;ition? tr&egrave;s facilement:
de vingt deux chapitres qui compo&s;ent cette vie d'Atticus dix huit
furent publi&eacute;s de &s;on vivant. <HI>Hactenus Attico vivo haec a nobis edita
&s;unt</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Idem, c. 18.</NOTE> 'Le pa&s;&s;age, o&ugrave; il e&s;t parl&eacute; de la mort de Catulle, &s;e trouve
dans le douzi&egrave;me chapitre; d'o&ugrave; il s'en&s;uit que Catulle mourut avant
Atticus. Mais celui ci finit &s;a vie &s;ous le con&s;ulat de Cn. Domitius
et de C. So&s;ius<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Idem, o. 21.</NOTE>. Si l'on vouloit pou&s;&s;er l'exactitude encore plus
loin, et qu'on e&ucirc;t envie de d&eacute;terminer l'ann&eacute;e pr&eacute;ci&s;e de la mort
de notre po&euml;te, on ne &s;e tromperoit pas de beaucoup en prenant

l'ann&eacute;e moyenne entre A. U. C. 706 et 721; ce qui nous donnera
714, &eacute;poque qui quadre fort bien avec tout ce que nous en &s;avons
d'ailleurs.</P>
<P>Le &s;eul argument de Scaliger, qui pourroit embarra&s;&s;er, e&s;t celui
qu'il tire du po&euml;me &s;&eacute;culaire que Catulle doit avoir compo&s;&eacute;. La con|jecture
de Vo&s;&s;ius qu'on c&eacute;l&eacute;bra des jeux au commencement du VII
&s;iecle de Rome n'e&s;t pas &s;outenable. Je doute que celle de Bayle
vaille mieux. Le commencement de ce &s;iecle &eacute;toit marqu&eacute; par tant
de d&eacute;&s;ordres, on negligeoit tellement les anciennes c&eacute;r&eacute;moines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 37.</NOTE>,
qu'il n'y pas d'apparence qu'on ait con&ccedil;u le de&s;&s;ein de c&eacute;l&eacute;brer de
pareils jeux, ni que le peuple s'y attend&icirc;t. Mais quel be&s;oin de
&s;uppo&s;er que ce po&euml;me avoit &eacute;t&eacute; compo&s;&eacute; pour les &s;&eacute;culaires. N'e&s;t il
pas bien plus naturel de le croire de&s;tin&eacute; pour la f&ecirc;te de Diane qui &s;e

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG the Romans, that generous people, who had &s;o many in&s;titutions
worthy of being admired and imitated, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable old lawyers,
who&s;e long labours had rendered them the oracles of the bar, did not think
their time u&s;ele&s;s to the community, when it was employed in forming the
talents of youth, and in providing for them&s;elves worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. This
excellent cu&s;tom ought to be adopted, and extended to other &s;ciences. Who|ever
is acquainted with your reputation and your works, will not deny you
the title of one of the mo&s;t learned men of the age; and I hope that my
fooli&s;h pre&s;umption does not deceive me, when I a&s;cribe to my&s;elf &s;ome na|tural
aptitude for &s;ucceeding in the pur&s;uits of literature. Your corre&s;pond|ence
would be highly u&s;eful to me. On this ground only I reque&s;t it. In
the hope that it will not be refu&s;ed, I proceed to beg your explanation of
<PB N="352" REF="373">
&s;ome difficulties that I have met with, and your opinion of &s;ome conjectures
that have occurred to my mind.</P>
<P>1. Who was that Pi&s;o, the father, to whom Horace addre&s;&s;es his Art of
Poetry? Mr. Dacier &s;uppo&s;es him to have been the high-prie&s;t who ob|tained
a triumph for his exploits in Thrace, and who died praefect of the city
in the &s;even hundred and eighty-fifth year of Rome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. vi. c. 10. Flor. Hi&s;t. Rom. L. iv. c. 12. T. Liv. Epitom. L. c.</NOTE>. But that could not be
the man; for Horace's Art of Poetry was written before the year &s;even hun|dred
and thirty-four, &s;ince it makes mention of Virgil (who died that year)
in terms which &s;hew that he was &s;till alive<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Horat. Art. Poet. v. 55.</NOTE>: and in another part of the
poem<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. v. 366.</NOTE>, Horace addre&s;&s;es the elde&s;t of Pi&s;o's &s;ons, as a young man of culti|vated
talents; which implies that he was not le&s;s than eighteen or twenty
years of age. But L. Pi&s;o, the high-prie&s;t, could not &s;urely have a &s;on &s;o old.
He him&s;elf died at the age of four&s;core<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Tacit. ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>, in the &s;even hundred and eighty-fifth
<PB N="353" REF="374">
year of Rome. He was born, then, in &s;even hundred and five; and was not
above thirty when the Art of Poetry was written. It is clear therefore, that he
is not the per&s;on to whom Horace writes; but, among the number of other
men who bore that name, I wi&s;h that you would help me to di&s;cover the
Pi&s;o to whom that poem was mo&s;t probably addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>2. You know how much trouble it has co&s;t the critics to find out Horace's
true de&s;ign in the third ode of his third book. This ma&s;terly performance
is di&s;tingui&s;hed by greatne&s;s of thought and dignity of expre&s;&s;ion; but we
are &s;urpri&s;ed and grieved to find, that the end does not corre&s;pond with the
beginning; and that Juno's &s;peech is totally unconnected with what precedes
or follows it; &s;o that after admiring the detached parts of this ode, we are
forced to condemn it as a whole. Taneguy le Fevre explained it by a con|jecture,
which Dacier thinks de&s;erving of as high encomiums as the ode
it&s;elf; and which is, doubtle&s;s, very ingenious. You know that his expla|nation
turns on the &s;uppo&s;ed dread of the Romans, le&s;t the &s;eat of their em|pire
<PB N="354" REF="375">
&s;hould be removed to Troy; and that he fancies the ode to have been
written with a view to divert Augu&s;tus from &s;uch a de&s;ign, by &s;hewing him
how earne&s;tly the Gods had co-operated towards the de&s;truction of Troy,
and how much their refentment would be provoked by an attempt to rebuild
that ill-fated city. The people might the more naturally &s;u&s;pect Augu&s;tus
of &s;uch an intention, becau&s;e it was thought to have been entertained by his
adoptive father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. i. c. 79.</NOTE>. But this conjecture, I fear, will not bear examination. It
is impo&s;&s;ible to prove tho&s;e pretended fears of the Romans; which are ren|dered
highly improbable, when we con&s;ider that Augu&s;tus was remarkable
for his affectionate partiality towards Rome; as may be &s;een in his Life, by
Suetonius, c. 28, 29, 30. I &s;hall mention but two examples of it. He en|couraged
almo&s;t all the great men of Rome to adorn the city by &s;uperb edi|fices<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vell. Paterculus, L. ii. c. 89.</NOTE>;
and him&s;elf erected a temple to Mars the Avenger, where the &s;enate was
ordered to a&s;&s;emble during its deliberations concerning wars and triumphs<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 29.</NOTE>.
<PB N="355" REF="376">
The&s;e are not the actions of a man who wi&s;hed to found a new capital. The ex|ample
of his uncle is not applicable; that project was formed by him towards
the end of his life, when he was intoxicated by pro&s;perity, and engaged in a
thou&s;and wild enterpri&s;es, which the prudence of Augu&s;tus carefully avoided.
The cautious firmne&s;s with which the latter prince always refu&s;ed the office
of dictator, confirms my remark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 52. Vell. Patercul. L. ii. c. 89.</NOTE>. Such are the rea&s;ons which hinder me
from acquie&s;cing in Le Fevre's explanation. I am &s;orry for it, and will not
be ea&s;y till you &s;upply me with another more &s;olidly founded, and equally
well fitted to remove all difficulties.</P>
<P>3. Antiochus, king of Syria, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal cities in
Coele-Syria and Judaea, belonging to young Ptolemy, then under the pro|tection
of the Romans. That people undertake the defence of their pupil,
and order Antiochus to re&s;tore his towns. He de&s;pi&s;es their orders, and
keeps tho&s;e towns in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; in con&s;equence of which, the Romans
&s;end to him a &s;econd emba&s;&s;y, which, without making any mention of young
Ptolemy's preten&s;ions, <Q>claim tho&s;e towns as belonging to the Romans by
<PB N="356" REF="377">
the right of war.</Q> The&s;e are Ju&s;tin's words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;tin. L. xxx. c. 1.</NOTE>, which pre&s;ent us with a
very perplexing difficulty; becau&s;e we do not perceive how the Romans
could have acquired tho&s;e places by the right of war, &s;ince they were &s;o far
from having made conque&s;ts in A&s;ia then, that they did not carry their arms
into that country till a later aera. A treaty indeed &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them
and the kings of Egypt<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. Liv. Epitom. L. iv. Eutrop. L. ii. Valer. Maxim. L. iv. c. 3.</NOTE>, but it was a treaty merely of friend&s;hip and alliance,
neither preceded nor followed by any war. I thought that an examination
of the other hi&s;torians, who relate the &s;ame tran&s;actions, might throw light
on this ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age of Ju&s;tin. But Livy, who mentions &s;everal times<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. Liv. L. xxxiii. c. 34. 39, 40.</NOTE> the
negociations by which the Romans endeavoured to recover for Ptolemy the
places taken from him by Antiochus, is altogether &s;ilent with regard to this
"right of war," in virtue of which they were demanded. I acquainted the
learned Mr. Breitinger, profe&s;&s;or of Greek at Zurich, with my difficulty on
<PB N="357" REF="378">
this &s;ubject; which, after attempting in vain to re&s;olve, he was obliged to
leave unexplained. But,</P>
<Q><L>"Nil de&s;perandum, Teucro duce; et au&s;pice Teucro."</L></Q>
<P>4. A difference of opinion between Scaliger and I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius, concerning
the time of Catullus' death, made great noi&s;e in the republic of letters. I
have not at hand the original arguments of tho&s;e learned men, which are
contained in their re&s;pective editions of Catullus; but Bayle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bayle Dictionnaire Critique, art. Catulle.</NOTE> has given us a
particular account of their di&s;pute, with his own reflections on the &s;ubject.
I am &s;orry that I cannot draw from the fountain head; but Bayle's accuracy
as a compiler will not be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the labours of the&s;e great &s;cholars, I am far from think|ing
the que&s;tion decided. Vo&s;&s;ius &s;eems to me to place Catullus' death too
early, and Scaliger certainly fixes it at too late an aera. That poet &s;urely did
not die in the year of the city &s;ix hundred and ninety-&s;ix; but neither did
<PB N="358" REF="379">
he live to &s;ee the &s;ecular games of Augu&s;tus celebrated in &s;even hundred and
thirty-&s;ix. Let us prove the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, and endeavour to find out the
true aera in que&s;tion, which mu&s;t have been at an intermediate time between
the years ju&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>Catullus &s;peaks of Great Britain and its inhabitants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Catull. Carm. xi. &amp;c.</NOTE>, with which Cae&s;ar fir&s;t
made the Romans acquainted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tacit. in Vit. Agricol. C. 13.</NOTE>, by his expedition thither, in the year of Rome
&s;ix hundred and ninety-eight<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar. Comm. L. iv. Dion. Hi&s;t. L. xxxix. p. 113.</NOTE>. Catullus al&s;o mentions the &s;econd con&s;ul&s;hip
of Pompey, which happened on that &s;ame year<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Catull. Carm. cxi.</NOTE>. He lived &s;o late as the
year &s;even hundred and &s;ix, &s;ince he &s;peaks of the con&s;ul&s;hip of Vatinius<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Idem, lii.</NOTE>.
I will not make u&s;e of Scaliger's arguments to prove that the poet witne&s;&s;ed
Cae&s;ar's triumphs, becau&s;e I do not believe them well-founded. I will not
particularly examine whether the words <HI>paterna prima lancinata &s;unt bona</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Idem, xxvii. ver. 29.</NOTE>,
be&s;t apply to the fir&s;t or la&s;t victories of Cae&s;ar, becau&s;e I do not believe
them to have any reference to the one or the other. We need only to read
<PB N="359" REF="380">
the epigram attentively, to perceive that Catullus always addre&s;&s;es Cae&s;ar
in the &s;econd per&s;on, and Mamurra in the third.</P>
<P>The poet alludes, therefore, not to Cae&s;ar's di&s;&s;ipation, but to that of Ma|murra;
and all the con&s;equences deduced from his applying his words to the
former, are built on a fal&s;e hypothe&s;is<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Were we curious to a&s;certain exactly the date of this epigram, a pa&s;&s;age of Cicero would lead us to fix it at the year 708. For, notwith&s;tanding Bayle's rea&s;onings, we can|not regard it in any other light than that of a &s;atire written again&s;t Mamurra; an opinion embraced by the learned Dr. Middleton. There is no weight in the ob&s;ervation, that Ca|tullus would not have ventured to write this epigram again&s;t Cae&s;ar in the plenitude of his power. Cae&s;ar's clemency towards his enemies is well known; and the terms in which hi&s;torians &s;peak of his lenity &s;hewn to this &s;atiri&s;t implies that he was then po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of power to puni&s;h him; otherwi&s;e his moderation would have been of little value. Tacitus<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Annal. L. iv. c. 34.</NOTE> &s;peaks of this affair as a parallel to that of Bibalculus, who &s;ati|ri&s;ed Augu&s;tus when the latter was certainly inve&s;ted with &s;overeign dominion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="381">
Catullus, on the other hand, did not live to &s;ee the &s;ecular games cele|brated
by Augu&s;tus, &s;ince he died before Tibullus. Ovid, in an elegy
written on the death of the latter, places Catullus among the poets whom
his friend will meet with in the Ely&s;ian fields<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ovid. Eleg. L. iii. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But when did Tibullus die? A little epigram of Domitius Marius in|forms
us, that he died the &s;ame day, or at lea&s;t in the &s;ame year, with Virgil<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. Tibull. Carm. L. iv. c. 15.</NOTE>.
Now it is well known that Virgil died the twenty-&s;econd of September &s;even
hundred and thirty-four<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Vit. Virgil.</NOTE>. Catullus then could not &s;ee the &s;ecular games,
which were not celebrated till &s;even hundred and thirty-&s;ix.</P>
<P>We may go farther, and affirm, that Catullus was dead before the year
&s;even hundred and twenty-one. This is proved by a contemporary hi&s;to|rian,
<PB N="361" REF="382">
the friend of Cicero<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. i. c. 55. Vo&s;&s;. de Hi&s;t. Latin. L. i. c. 24.</NOTE> and of Catullus<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Catull. Carm. i.</NOTE>; I mean Cornelius Nepos. In
his Life of Atticus, &s;peaking of a certain Julius Calidius, to whom Atticus
had rendered very important &s;ervices, he di&s;tingui&s;hes him, <Q>as the mo&s;t
elegant poet of that age, &s;ince the death of Lucretius and Catullus <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cornel. Nepos, in Vit. Attici, c. 12.</NOTE>.</Q>
The latter, therefore, was dead before Nepos wrote this pa&s;&s;age; of which
it is not difficult to fix the date. Nepos' Life of Atticus con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-two
chapters; the fir&s;t eighteen of which were, as he tells us, written while
the &s;ubject of them &s;till lived<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Idem, c. 18.</NOTE>. The pa&s;&s;age mentioning the death of Ca|tullus
is in the twelfth chapter; from whence it follows, that Atticus &s;ur|vived
Catullus. But Atticus died during the con&s;ul&s;hip of Cn. Domitius
and C. So&s;ius<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Idem, o. 21.</NOTE>. Did we wi&s;h to a&s;certain &s;till more accurately the preci&s;e
year of Catullus' death, we &s;hould not be much mi&s;taken in fixing it at the
middle term between the years of Rome &s;even hundred and &s;ix, and &s;even
<PB N="362" REF="383">
hundred and twenty-one; which will give us the year &s;even hundred and
fourteen; which very well agrees with all other particulars known con|cerning
him.</P>
<P>The only argument adduced by Scaliger, that can occa&s;ion any difficulty,
is, that Catullus compo&s;ed a &s;ecular poem. Vo&s;&s;ius' conjecture, that the
&s;ecular games were celebrated at the commencement of the &s;eventh century
of Rome, is altogether unwarranted: that of Bayle, I fear, re&s;ts not on
much better authority. The beginning of that century was deformed by
&s;o many di&s;orders, and by &s;uch a marked neglect of ancient ceremonies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 37.</NOTE>,
that there is not any probability that &s;uch games &s;hould then have been
either exhibited or expected. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e that Ca|tullus'
poem was written for the &s;ecular games. It might have been in|tended
merely for Diana's fe&s;tival, which was celebrated yearly in the month
of Augu&s;t; as Bentley conjectured<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bentl. in Praefat. Edit. Horatian.</NOTE>. This is confirmed by comparing this
poem with Horace's <HI>Carmen Seculare.</HI> In the former, both the boys and girls
<PB N="363" REF="384">
form but one chorus, which addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to Diana<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catull. Carm. xxxiv. ver. 1.</NOTE>. In Horace, the boys
addre&s;s them&s;elves to Apollo, and the girls to Diana<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Horat. Carm. Secular. ver. 34.</NOTE>. This di&s;tinction had
been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the oracle who commanded the celebration of the
games<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. Di&s;&s;ertat. Cl. Turretin de Ludis Secular. p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. GESNER to Mr. GIBBON.</HEAD>
<P>1. YOU inquire who were the Pi&s;os, of whom Horace &s;peaks in &s;uch ho|nourable
terms in his Art of Poetry. Dacier and Sanadon would probably,
mo&s;t learned Sir, have obtained more credit with you, had they cited the
authority on which their opinion re&s;ts; and independently of which, it &s;eems
no better than a gue&s;s, which a &s;light argument is &s;ufficient to overturn.
This authority is that of Porphyrio, an ancient writer, who treats of the
names mentioned in Horace, and who here perhaps copies from &s;ome author
more ancient than him&s;elf. In his corrected edition Porphyrio &s;ays, <Q>Ho|race's
work, intitled the Art of Poetry, is addre&s;&s;ed to L. Pi&s;o, who was
afterwards governor of Rome; for Pi&s;o was him&s;elf a poet, and a patron
of literary pur&s;uits.</Q> But chronology, you &s;ay, does not warrant this
explanation. It does; for Tacitus tells us, in his Annals, (lib. vi. c. 10.)
that Pi&s;o died U. C. 785, at the age of eighty. He held his office twenty
<PB N="365" REF="386">
years; and therefore entered on it U. C. 765; before which period Horace
mu&s;t have &s;ent to him the Art of Poetry, (which I &s;u&s;pect once &s;tood at the
third epi&s;tle of the &s;econd book,) becau&s;e Porphyrio &s;ays, <Q>who was after|wards
governor of Rome.</Q> Let us &s;uppo&s;e that Pi&s;o's &s;on was born
when the father was thirty years old; and that the &s;on was &s;ixteen when
Horace addre&s;&s;ed him, <HI>O major juvenum;</HI> the Art of Poetry will then have
been written in the fifty-&s;econd year of Horace's age; which well agrees
with Bentley's computation; a &s;ubject which I remember to have exa|mined
and approved when about the &s;ame time of life I publi&s;hed my edi|tion
of Horace. If we think &s;ixteen years too young for the prai&s;es be|&s;towed
by the poet, we may add to them five, or even ten years more.
But to this mode of reckoning it is objected, that Virgil was alive when
Horace wrote his Art of Poetry; and as the latter died in the year of
Rome &s;even hundred and thirty-five, Pi&s;o, who was then but thirty years
old him&s;elf, could not have a &s;on above ten or twelve at the utmo&s;t. But
&s;ome critics do not di&s;approve of the application of <HI>juvenis</HI> to a boy of ten
<PB N="366" REF="387">
years, and of a forward genius: Grotius and others were poets at that age;
and the Roman courtiers would naturally, I think, be prodigal in u&s;ing the
term <HI>juvenis,</HI> after Cicero gave &s;o much offence by applying the term <HI>puer</HI>
to Augu&s;tus.</P>
<P>But I &s;ee not any convincing argument to prove that Virgil was alive
when the Art of Poetry was written. For, in the pa&s;&s;age alluded to, Horace
does not contra&s;t living poets with tho&s;e that were dead, but ancient poets
with the modern; and, according to the critics whom he mentions, not
death alone, but the being dead a certain number of years, was nece&s;&s;ary for
the attainment of poetical &s;ame.</P>
<Q><L>"E&s;t vetus atque probus, centum qui perficit annos."</L></Q>
<BIBL>See the fir&s;t epi&s;tle of the &s;econd book.</BIBL>
<P>2. Concerning the third ode of the third book, I formerly gave my opi|nion
in the ob&s;ervations accompanying my edition, which, as you have not
&s;een them, I &s;hall here repeat and explain. Augu&s;tus &s;ometimes repre&s;ented
in &s;port the &s;uppers of the gods. We know from Suetone, lib. ii. c. 70.
that he was blamed for his imitation of the &s;upper of the twelve gods, which
<PB N="367" REF="388">
u&s;ed to take place in the capitol, where pallets were &s;pread for them; of
which we &s;ee an example in Livy, lib. xxii. c. 10. Is it not po&s;&s;ible that
Horace, either with or without the orders of Augu&s;tus, might think proper
to write ver&s;es adapted to &s;uch a repre&s;entation? Might he not endeavour to
remove the blame attached to it, by exhibiting an example in which it was
not only innocent, but conformable with the in&s;titutions and inclinations of
the Romans? At the &s;ame time his ode would be a compliment to the
Julian family? which had long boa&s;ted its de&s;cent from Aeneas and I&uuml;lus. For
entering on this &s;ubject, the poet ingeniou&s;ly prepares the way, by &s;howing
that men had attained divinity through ju&s;tice and fortitude. Augu&s;tus is
entitled to our admiration and prai&s;e; and, as he &s;ung in another ode, written
nearly about the &s;ame time, <HI>pre&s;ens divus habebitur,</HI> being not le&s;s worthy of
divinity than Bacchus and Romulus; the latter of whom was not without dif|ficulty
admitted to that honour, <Q>till Juno made her mo&s;t plea&s;ing and ac|ceptable
&s;peech in the council of the gods.</Q> This &s;peech is of the &s;ame
purport with that in the Aeneid, lib. xii. v. 791. <HI>&amp; &s;eq.;</HI> and might have
been pronounced with propriety, without &s;uppo&s;ing that Augu&s;tus ever &s;eri|ou&s;ly
thought of changing the &s;eat of his empire. That prince al&s;o mu&s;t
<PB N="368" REF="389">
have been plea&s;ed with an attempt to per&s;uade the people that he condemned
a de&s;ign, &s;aid to have been entertained by Julius Cae&s;ar, but which was &s;o
much dete&s;ted by the Romans, and would, if carried into execution, have
been &s;o calamitous to Rome. The &s;peech indeed is longer, and more pa|thetic
than might be expected from the beginning of the ode; but <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t
be ignorant of the nature of lyric poetry, as illu&s;trated in the writings of the
ancients, who finds fault with the length of this real or apparent digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>3. The knot mu&s;t be hard indeed, which not only baffles the exertions of
a learned and ingenious youth, but re&s;i&s;ts the &s;trength of Breitinger, a ve|teran
in the literary field, who&s;e name I never pronounce but with the highe&s;t
re&s;pect. How could Roman amba&s;&s;adors require that the cities taken by
Antiochus in A&s;ia &s;hould be re&s;tored, according to the law of war, to Rome,
when the &s;enate &s;hortly before had declared tho&s;e cities to belong to its
pupil Ptolemy? Or how could the Romans claim tho&s;e cities by the law of
war, when Scipio, a few years afterwards, was the fir&s;t Roman general that
pa&s;&s;ed into A&s;ia with an army? Livy, lib. xxxvii. The knot, however,
may be untied, without having recour&s;e to Alexander's &s;word, provided we
<PB N="369" REF="390">
follow the &s;eries of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, as related by Ju&s;tin and Livy. The
latter hi&s;torian, lib. xxxi. c. 14, relates, <Q>that Philip's courage was in|crea&s;ed
by his league with Antiochus, king of Syria, with whom, as &s;oon
as he learned Ptolemy's death, he purpo&s;ed, according to the tenor
of that agreement, dividing the &s;poils of Egypt.</Q> Ju&s;tin, again, lib. xxx.
c. 2, tells us, <Q>that the Alexandrians &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Rome, re|que&s;ting
the &s;enate to defend the cau&s;e of their pupil, threatened with the
partition of his dominions, in con&s;equence of a treaty for that purpo&s;e be|tween
Philip and Antiochus.</Q> This treaty indeed &s;oon began to be car|ried
into effect; for, according to Livy, lib. xxxii. c. 19. <Q>Antiochus,
while his ally was occupied in the war with Rome, conquered all the
cities belonging to Ptolemy in Coele-Syria; purpo&s;ing next to invade
the coa&s;t of Caria and Cilicia, and at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;i&s;t Philip with a
fleet and army.</Q> Meanwhile Philip is conquered by the Roman con&s;ul
Quintius; who then openly declared to Antiochus' amba&s;&s;adors, <Q>that their
<PB N="370" REF="391">
ma&s;ter mu&s;t evacuate (&s;upply, "according to the law of war,") all tho&s;e
cities to which either Philip or Ptolemy had any claims. <BIBL>Livy, lib. xxxiii.
c. 34.</BIBL></Q> Ju&s;tin's narrative, therefore, though ob&s;cured by brevity, is yet
con&s;i&s;tent with truth.</P>
<P>Do you not repent, learned Sir, the having written to an indolent old
man, who could delay two months &s;ending an an&s;wer to a letter &s;o obliging,
and &s;o honourable to him&s;elf? I will not throw the blame on my advanced
age, though I begin to feel my former powers of exertion &s;omewhat &s;lacken
and abate under the weight of &s;ixty-&s;even years. At this time of life mo&s;t
old men are indulged with a diminution of labour; whereas I, on the con|trary,
am continually burdened with an increa&s;e of occupations and cares.
I belong to &s;everal academies, particularly that of Berlin, and this here of
Gottingen; which la&s;t I am appointed to direct &s;ix months in the year; I
al&s;o pre&s;ide weekly in the German &s;ociety of this place, and frequently cor|re&s;pond
with the Latin &s;ociety of Jena. I am entru&s;ted with the care of
the public library, con&s;i&s;ting at lea&s;t of fifty thou&s;and volumes; with the in|&s;pection
<PB N="371" REF="392">
of the colleges in his maje&s;ty's German dominions; and with the
&s;uperintendance of about twenty youths, who are educated at the public ex|pence.
The ta&s;k al&s;o falls on me of writing whatever is in&s;erted in the ar|chives
of the univer&s;ity, in the name of the rector and &s;enate: and it is my
duty to give daily three, four, and &s;ometimes more prelections. To the&s;e
public offices mu&s;t be added the avocations of private company, and of a
very exten&s;ive corre&s;pondence. Be&s;ides, I have always &s;ome work in hand,
which requires nicer attention to render it worthy of the public eye. At
pre&s;ent I am employed about an edition of Claudian; which, God willing!
&s;hall be publi&s;hed in the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer. Thus circum&s;tanced, I
confe&s;s that I laid a&s;ide your letter, which &s;eemed as if it would require more
pains to an&s;wer than were afterwards found nece&s;&s;ary, until I &s;hould enjoy a
few hours of uninterrupted lei&s;ure. This opportunity occurred only ye&s;ter|day,
of which, you &s;ee, I made u&s;e.</P>
<P>It remains that I reque&s;t you to receive favourably this attempt; and if it
does not fully an&s;wer your expectation, to a&s;cribe the failure to any other
<PB N="372" REF="393">
cau&s;e rather than my want of inclination to oblige you. Brevity was my
aim, becau&s;e it &s;eemed unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat what you had &s;o well &s;aid on
the &s;ubject. I write in Latin, a language familiar to me, le&s;t I &s;hould com|mit
a mi&s;take &s;imilar to that of which you, though well-&s;killed in French, are
guilty, when you &s;ay, <HI>Un different que Scaliger &amp; I&s;. Vo&s;&s;ius ont eu en&s;emble.</HI>
From which words it might be concluded, that a difference had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween
the&s;e learned men, of whom the one died nine years before the other
was born. I remain &s;incerely, with much con&s;ideration, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Apr&egrave;s cette explication, je vous avouerai qu'il me re&s;te encore quel|ques
nuages &s;ur le Pi&s;on de l'Art Po&eacute;tique. Vous ne croyez pas que
les paroles d'Horace touchant Virgile, prouvent que ce po&euml;te f&ucirc;t en|core
vivant, et que l'oppo&s;ition e&s;t plut&ocirc;t des anciens aux modernes,
que des mots aux vivans. J'ai relu l'endroit, mais cette nouvelle
lecture, et les r&eacute;flexions aux quelles elle a donn&eacute; lieu, n'ont fait que
me confirmer dans ma premi&egrave;re opinion. Horace trouvoit la langue
<PB N="378" REF="399">
Latine pauvre et trop &s;t&eacute;rile, pour exprimer les id&eacute;es ab&s;traites que
les compagnons de Romulus, les p&acirc;tres, et les brigands ne connoi&s;|&s;oient
point: plu&s;ieurs de &s;es compatriotes lui avoient trouv&eacute; le
m&ecirc;me d&eacute;faut. Horace &s;ouhaite de l'enrichir. Il propo&s;e pour cet
effet aux Virgile, aux Varius, de travailler dans ce de&s;&s;ein, et d'em|prunter
du Grec quantit&eacute; de termes &eacute;nergiques dont ils avoient
be&s;oin. Il leur offre &s;on &s;ecours. C'e&s;t un projet qu'il forme et non
une cho&s;e d&eacute;ja faite qu'il ju&s;tifie. Par con&s;&eacute;quent l'avenir qu'il envi|&s;age
ne peut regarder que ceux d'entre les &eacute;crivains qui vivoient en|core.
Par con&s;&eacute;quent l'Art Po&eacute;tique fut compo&s;&eacute; avant l'an 735.
Le point de vue &s;ous lequel je con&s;idere ce pa&s;&s;age, e&s;t &s;i bien celui du

<P>After this apology, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I have &s;till &s;ome remaining doubts
concerning the Pi&s;o to whom Horace addre&s;&s;es his Art of Poetry. You
think that the manner in which that poet &s;peaks of Virgil does not prove the
latter to be &s;till alive; becau&s;e Horace does not oppo&s;e the dead to the living,
but the ancients to the moderns. I examined the pa&s;&s;age again, and that
new peru&s;al excited reflections which confirmed me more &s;trongly in my
former opinion. Horace thought the Latin tongue too poor and barren, and
<PB N="378" REF="399">
deficient in words expre&s;&s;ive of ab&s;tract ideas, which were unknown to Ro|mulus'
companions, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;hepherds and robbers. This imperfection
had been remarked by others. Horace, wi&s;hing to remedy it, propo&s;es
to the Virgils and Variu&s;es, to co-operate with him in this de&s;ign, by bor|rowing
from the Greek many energetic terms and phra&s;es which were want|ing
in Latin. He does not ju&s;tify a thing already done, but propo&s;es a new
enterpri&s;e. The futurity which he looks to can only have a reference to
authors &s;till alive. The Art of Poetry was therefore written before the year
of Rome &s;even hundred and thirty-five. This explanation agrees &s;o well
with the poet's thought, that his oppo&s;ition between the dead and living
poets, concludes with one of the ju&s;te&s;t and livelie&s;t images that I ever
remember to have met with:</P>

<P>The <HI>licuit</HI> has a reference to the Terences and the Ceciliu&s;es, who were long
<PB N="379" REF="400">
dead; the <HI>licebit,</HI> in the future, to the Variu&s;es and Virgils, who were &s;till
alive, and might avail them&s;elves of the maxim<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This explanation is the more probable, becau&s;e Virgil appears in his works to value him&s;elf rather on reviving old words, than on borrowing new ones from the Greek. I doubt whether a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age can be pointed out, in which he followed Horace's advice.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>You &s;ay that Pi&s;o's elde&s;t &s;on might be ten years old when the Art of
Poetry was publi&s;hed; an age at which Grotius wrote ver&s;es. Grotius did
&s;o; but how few boys of that age have not only the fire to write, but the
judgment to critici&s;e poetry? It is not likely that Pi&s;o the father &s;hould
have children at the age of twenty. You well know the paucity of mar|riages
under Augu&s;tus, which rendered the conjugal felicity of Germanicus

the Roman nobles from marriage, e&s;pecially amid&s;t the civil wars, which,

the fir&s;t of tho&s;e laws was enacted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Horat. Carm. Secular. v. 17, &amp;c. Torrent de Lege Juli&acirc; ad Calc. Horat. p. 75, &amp;c.</NOTE>. If an ordinary generation is computed

to be extended to forty, than reduced to twenty years. The&s;e, I acknow|ledge,
are but probabilities; but in the &s;cience of critici&s;m probabilities de|&s;troy
po&s;&s;ibilities, and are them&s;elves de&s;troyed by proofs. This principle
is not to be controverted. The authority of Porphyrio is of too little weight
among the learned to be the foundation of an argument; it might at be&s;t
help to prop an argument, otherwi&s;e well &s;upported. The ancients do not
a&s;&s;ign to him the fir&s;t rank among Horace's commentators<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Vitam Horat. &s;ine nomine Autoris.</NOTE>; and the mo|derns,
<PB N="381" REF="402">
particularly Mr. Dacier, find in him many errors. I do not &s;ee any
ground for your fir&s;t hypothe&s;is. If Pi&s;o had a &s;on when he was thirty years
old, this &s;on might be &s;ixteen when Horace wrote his Art of Poetry; an age
which you think agrees with every quality required in him. Did you not
forget, in writing this &s;entence, that Horace died in &s;even hundred and forty-five,
when Pi&s;o him&s;elf was only forty years old?</P>
<P>2. I think it certain that Horace, in the third ode of his third book,
meant to &s;how the Romans, that if their prince a&s;pired to divine honours,
<HI>Viamque affectat Olympo,</HI> he well merited them by his exploits, which rivalled
tho&s;e of the greate&s;t heroes, Bacchus, Hercules, and Romulus, who, after
trampling on their human enemies, and appea&s;ing the jealou&s;y of the gods,
had opened for them&s;elves a road to the palace of the immortals. But did
the poet al&s;o intend, by this ode, to re&s;i&s;t and de&s;troy the clamours of the
people concerning the infamous &s;upper of the twelve gods? I think he did
not. 1. This de&s;ign does not agree with chronology. Suetonius does not
tell us the date of this &s;upper; but &s;ince Mark Antony mentioned it, in his
<PB N="382" REF="403">
letters to Augu&s;tus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suet. L. ii. c. 70.</NOTE>, it mu&s;t have happened before the la&s;t quarrel of the tri|umvirs.
According to Bentley<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bentley in Praefat. ad Horat.</NOTE>, who&s;e opinion you adopt, Horace wrote
the third book of his odes in the forty-&s;econd and forty-third years of his
age; that is, in the &s;even hundred and twenty-eighth and &s;even hundred and
twenty-ninth years of Rome. An apology for Augu&s;tus' debaucheries,
written &s;even years after they happened, could have only &s;erved to revive the
memory of enormities, which the policy of that prince and the gratitude of
the Romans had long con&s;igned to oblivion. 2. Augu&s;tus &s;upped with
eleven men and women, who, as well as him&s;elf, were adorned with the
emblems of divinities. The poet &s;eated Augu&s;tus at the table of the gods,
<HI>purpureo bibit ore nectar;</HI> but can we rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that he meant to
place there the companions of his fea&s;t? This would have been no render
the honour too common; and his panegyric would have degenerated into a &s;a|tire.
I agree with you, that it is rather de&s;irable than nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover the
<PB N="383" REF="404">
plan of an ode; the writers of Lyric poetry having always enjoyed the pri|vilege
of &s;oaring to heights, which, if admired by fancy, mu&s;t not be
critici&s;ed by rea&s;on. This fault, if it be one, is compen&s;ated by great
beauties. The two fir&s;t &s;tanzas prove the wonderful efficacy of poetry
when combined with philo&s;ophy. The <HI>ju&s;tum &amp; tenacem propo&s;iti virum</HI> is the
&s;age of the Stoics, their king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horat. Serm. L. i. Serm. iii. ver. 124.</NOTE>, and only happy man; all who&s;e de&s;igns are

prejudices, never ca&s;ts his eyes on the tumults of human life, without ex|claiming,
<Q><L>"O! curas hominum! O! quantum in rebus inane!"</L></Q>
To the di&s;grace of mankind, &s;uch a character never exi&s;ted; but it is not
a &s;mall honour for the &s;pecies, that &s;uch perfect virtue has been de&s;cribed and
reli&s;hed. The climax is beautiful. The &s;age would re&s;i&s;t the clamorous

it is kindled. He would de&s;pi&s;e the threats of a furious tyrant: but the
hearts of tyrant &s;ometimes relent with compa&s;&s;ion. He would hear without
terror the raging tempe&s;t, which overpowers the cries of the wretched; but
fortune has often re&s;cued victims from the boi&s;terous waves. He would not
dread the thunder of Jupiter: here the trembling imagination pau&s;es, fear|ing

to Tacitus, when Dru&s;us arrived in the camp of the rebels, his or|ders
were di&s;obeyed, his offers &s;u&s;pected, the &s;oldiers made him pri&s;oner,
they in&s;ulted his friends, and waited only for a pretence to begin the &s;laughter.
Such were the dangers that threatened his per&s;on! <HI>Sibi ancipitia tam re.</HI> The

<P>I read with much plea&s;ure your &s;olution of the difficulty in Ju&s;tin; and

Moudon. C'&eacute;toit le con&s;eil perp&eacute;tuel du prince. Sans leur con|&s;entement,
il ne pouvoit, ni faire de nouvelles loix, ni &eacute;tablir de nou|veaux
impots. Si j'&eacute;tois &s;ur les lieux j'&eacute;tablirais ces droits, par vos
monumens les plus authentiques. Tout &eacute;loign&eacute; que j'en &s;uis, je ne
erains pas d'appeller &agrave; leur t&eacute;moignage. Il me re&s;te toujours une
preuve moins &s;en&s;ible pour le peuple, mais au&s;&s;i d&eacute;ci&s;ive pour les gens
de lettres: c'e&s;t l'analogie. Les Barbares du cinqui&egrave;me &s;iecle jette|rent
par toute l'Europe, les racines de ce gouvernement que Charle|magne
&eacute;tablit dans les Pays Bas, la France, l'Italie, la Sui&s;&s;e, et
<PB N="398" REF="419">
l'Allemagne. Quelques &eacute;venemens, les degr&eacute;s, et les tems ou les
arri&egrave;re-fiefs &s;e formerent des fiefs, ou le' clerg&eacute; acquit des terres &s;ei|gneuriales,
ou les villes acheterent leurs affranchi&s;&s;emens, y appor|terent
de l&eacute;g&egrave;res diff&eacute;rences. Mais le fond de cette con&s;titution e&s;t
demeur&eacute; dans toutes les r&eacute;volutions, et rien de plus libre que ce
fonds. Ces &eacute;tats, leurs membres, et leurs droits &s;e con&s;erverent
toujours, et partout ils &eacute;toient les m&ecirc;mes.</P>
<P>Je vous entends, mon ami, qui m'interrompez. Je vous ai &eacute;cout&eacute;,
me dites vous, avec patience: mais que voulez vous conclure de ce
tableau de notre gouvernement? Bien ou mal con&s;truit, nous n'en
re&s;&s;entons que des effets &s;alutaires, et vos con&s;eils, vos &eacute;tats, auroient
de la peine &agrave; nous d&eacute;gouter de nos magi&s;trats anciens, pour nous faire
e&s;&s;ayer des nouveaut&eacute;s.</P>
<P>Arretez, Mon&s;ieur; je vous ai parl&eacute; en homme libre, et vous me
r&eacute;pondez dans le langage de la &s;ervitude. Arretez. En convenant
pour un moment de votre bonheur, de qui le tenez vous? de la con|&s;titution?
<PB N="399" REF="420">
Vous n'o&s;ez pas le dire. C'e&s;t done du prince? Les
Romains en devoient un plus grand &agrave; Titus. Ils &eacute;toient cependant
de vils e&s;claves. Brutus vous auroit appris que, dans un &eacute;tat de&s;po|tique,
le prince peut quelquefois vouloir de bien: mais que dans les
&eacute;tats libres, il ne peut que le vouloir. La f&eacute;licit&eacute; actuelle du citoyen
et de l'e&s;clave, e&s;t &s;ouvent &eacute;gale, mais celle du dernier e&s;t pr&eacute;caire,
pui&s;qu'elle e&s;t fond&eacute;e &s;ur les pa&s;&s;ions des hommes, pendant que celle
du premier e&s;t a&s;&s;ur&eacute;e. Elle e&s;t li&eacute;e avec les loix qui contiennent
&eacute;galement ces m&ecirc;mes pa&s;&s;ions dans le &s;ouverain et dans le pay&s;an.</P>
<P>Mais malheureu&s;ement on ne trouve que trop de cho&s;es &agrave; re|prendre
dans votre admini&s;tration politique. Je vais d&eacute;tailler des
&s;autes, des negligences, des oppre&s;&s;ions. Vous vous r&eacute;crierez &s;ur
ma malignit&eacute;, mais en &s;ecret votre e&s;prit gro&s;&s;ira le catalogue de
cent articles que j'aurai ou ignor&eacute;s ou oubli&eacute;s. Il e&s;t du devoir du
&s;ouverain de faire jouir &s;on peuple de tous les avantages de la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile. Des guerres entrepri&s;es pour &s;a d&eacute;fen&s;e, l'en d&eacute;tourneront
<PB N="400" REF="421">
quelquefois; mais d&egrave;&s;que le calme renait dans &s;es &eacute;tats, des &eacute;tabli&s;&s;e|mens
utiles, et de &s;ages loix, la religion, les moeurs, les &s;ciences, le
commerce, les manufactures, l'agriculture, et la police, m&eacute;ritent toute
&s;on attention, et l'en r&eacute;compen&s;eront avec u&s;ure. Sur ces principes
jugeons le &s;&eacute;nat de Berne. Il a &eacute;t&eacute; ma&icirc;tre du Pays de Vaud de|puis
l'an 1536. Quand je con&s;idere ce qu'&eacute;toient alors la France,
l'Angleterre, la Hollande, ou l'Allemagne, j'ai de la peine &agrave; me per|&s;uader
qu'elles &eacute;toient les m&ecirc;mes pays que ceux qui portent aujourd'|hui
ces noms. De barbares, ils &s;ont devenus civili&s;&eacute;s; d'ignorans,
&eacute;clair&eacute;s; et de pauvres, riches. Je vois des villes o&ugrave; il y avoit des
d&eacute;&s;erts, et les for&ecirc;ts d&eacute;frich&eacute;es &s;e &s;ont converties en champs fer|tiles.
Leurs princes, et leurs mini&s;tres, un Henri quatre, un Sully,
un Colbert, une Elizabeth, un de Wit, un Frederic-Guillaume, ont
op&eacute;r&eacute; ces merveilles. La per&s;pective du Pays de Vaud n'e&s;t point
au&s;&s;i riante. Les arts langui&s;&s;ent, faute de ces r&eacute;compen&s;es que le
prince &s;eul peut donner; nul commerce, nulles manufactures, nuls
<PB N="401" REF="422">
projets utiles pour le pays; un engourdi&s;&s;ement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral qui regne
partout. Cependant les princes dont je viens de parler n'avoient
que des momens pour ces objets, o&ugrave; les Bernois ont eu des &s;iecles.
Que n'auroient ils pas fait, ces grands hommes, rarement tranquilles
&s;ur le tr&ocirc;ne, &s;i pendant deux cens douze ans, ils n'eu&s;&s;ent eu que
des voi&s;ins pacifiques, et des peuples &s;oumis? Je m'en rapporte &agrave;
vous m&ecirc;me. Indiquez moi quelque &eacute;tabli&s;&s;ement vraiment utile que
vous deviez au &s;ouverain. Mais ne m'indiquez pas l'acad&eacute;mie de
Lau&s;anne, fond&eacute;e par des vues de d&eacute;votion, dans la chaleur d'une
r&eacute;formation, neglig&eacute;e depuis, et toujours acad&eacute;mie, quoique un digne
magi&s;trat de cette ville, propo&s;&agrave;t de l'&eacute;riger en univer&s;it&eacute;.</P>
<P>Non ce n'e&s;t point une politique peu eclair&eacute;e qui fait agir vos
ma&icirc;tres. Je connois trop leur habilet&eacute;. Mais un monarque aime
&eacute;galement tous &s;es &s;ujets. Les citoyens d'une ville capitale voyent
au contraire d'un oeil jaloux l'agrandi&s;&s;ement des provinces. Si elles
s'&eacute;levent, di&s;ent ils, nous tombons. Nos &eacute;gales pour les lumi&egrave;res et
<PB N="402" REF="423">

vous l'an 1685. La mauvai&s;e politique de Louis XIV. expatria la
partie la plus indu&s;trieu&s;e de &s;es &s;ujets; une multitude &s;e r&eacute;fugia
dans le Pays de Vaud. Il etoit prochain, il etoit Fran&ccedil;ois. Ils ne|demandoient
qu'un azile, et l'auroient pay&eacute; au poids de l'or par les
riche&s;&s;es, et les arts plus pr&eacute;cieux que les riche&s;&s;es, qu'ils vous appor|toient.
Mais ici la politique partiale des Bernois s'&eacute;pouvanta. <Q>Si
nous fai&s;ons participer ces fugitifs &agrave; notre droit de Bourgeoi&s;ie,
la fortune nous &s;era commune; mais comment &eacute;lever des mortels
au rang des dieux? Si nous les lai&s;&s;ons confondus parmi nos
&s;ujets, nos &s;ujets recueilleront le fruit de leur indu&s;trie.</Q> Ils con|clurent

&s;ouverains &s;avoient mieux profiter de cette occa&s;ion unique. Il en
re&s;ta une partie dans le Pays de Vaud, mais c'&eacute;toit la partie la plus
pauvre, et la plus fain&eacute;ante, qui n'avoit ni le moyen, ni la vo|lont&eacute;

<P>`A peine ces malheureux commen&ccedil;oient ils &agrave; oublier leurs &s;ouf|frances

avoit &s;ucc&eacute; avec le lait, toute la duret&eacute; du &s;y&s;t&ecirc;me de Calvin, th&eacute;o|logien
atrabilaire qui aimoit trop la libert&eacute;, pour &s;ouffrir que les Chr&eacute;|tiens
porta&s;&s;ent d'autres fers que les &s;iens. D'ailleurs &s;a conformit&eacute;
avec les id&eacute;es d'un c&eacute;lebre philo&s;ophe, int&eacute;re&s;&s;oit l'honneur du nom
Allemand &agrave; le &s;outenir. Comme les &s;entimens s'&eacute;toient adoucis dans

qu'ils pourroient, non &agrave; la v&eacute;rit&eacute; par le fer et le feu, mais par

<P>En &s;outenant les droits de l'humanit&eacute;, je n'outre point les maxi|mes
de la tol&eacute;rance. Je veux bien que le magi&s;trat ne di&s;tribue

objets o&ugrave; l'erreur fait &s;on bonheur. Mais que le &s;ouverain &s;e
pr&ecirc;tant avec chaleur aux minuties th&eacute;ologiques, d&eacute;cide des que&s;tions
qu'on ne peut d&eacute;cider, a&s;&s;urement il e&s;t ab&s;urde. Qu'impo&s;ant des

<P>Je viens, non pas d'&eacute;pui&s;er, mais d'indiquer quelques d&eacute;fauts qui
&s;e trouvent dans votre pui&s;&s;ance l&eacute;gi&s;lative. Pa&s;&s;ons &agrave; l'ex&eacute;cutrice.
Celle-ci e&s;t la force publique, comme l'autre e&s;t la volont&eacute; publique.
Mais un &s;eul corps, un &s;eul homme, peut d&eacute;lib&eacute;rer et d&eacute;cider pour
toute une nation. Il ne peut tout &s;eul agir pour elle. L'admini&s;tra|tion
politique, compo&s;&eacute;e d'un nombre infini de branches, veut qu'un
grand nombre d'officiers, &s;oumis les uns aux autres, s'employent &agrave;
faire jouer la machine &agrave; laquelle le ma&icirc;tre ne peut que donner le
mouvement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral. Les honneurs, et les avantages, que les loix
attachent &agrave; ces emplois, doivent &ecirc;tre ouverts &agrave; tous les citoyens, que
leurs talens et leur &eacute;ducation ont mis en &eacute;tat de les remplir. Les
fardeaux leur &s;ont communs &agrave; tous, les recompen&s;es doivent l'etre
au&s;&s;i. Un gouvernement monarchique &s;atisfait ai&s;ement &agrave; ces ju&s;tes
<PB N="406" REF="427">
pr&eacute;ten&s;ions. `Al'exception de quelques courti&s;ans, qui approchent la
per&s;onne du prince d'a&s;&s;ez pr&egrave;s, pour &s;ub&s;tituer la flatterie aux &s;er|vices,
tous &s;es &s;ujets lui &s;ont &eacute;gaux. D&egrave;&s;qu'un homme a du m&eacute;rite,
ou, &s;i l'on veut de la faveur, on ne lui demande point s'il e&s;t Nor|mand
ou Proven&ccedil;al. D'Epernon &eacute;toit Ga&s;con; Richelieu, Champe|nois;
Mazarin, Romain. Mais dans les r&eacute;publiques ari&s;tocratiques,
les &s;ouverains compo&s;&eacute;s de toute une ville veulent &ecirc;tre l&eacute;gi&s;lateurs en
corps, et partager entre eux en d&eacute;tail tous les emplois con&s;id&eacute;rables.
Les talens, les lumi&egrave;res, dans votre Pays, &s;ont inutiles pour quicon|que
n'e&s;t pas n&eacute; Bernois, et dans un autre &s;ens ils &s;ont &eacute;galement
inutiles pour qui l'e&s;t. Le &s;ujet &s;e voit condamn&eacute; par &s;a nai&s;&s;ance &agrave;
ramper dans un honteu&s;e ob&s;curit&eacute;. Le d&eacute;&s;e&s;poir le &s;ai&s;it; il neglige
ce qui ne le peut mener &agrave; rien, et le grand homme ne devient qu'un
homme agr&eacute;able. Si je parlais de faire participer les &s;ujets aux
Bailliages, les Bernois crieroient au &s;acrilege; les Bailliages &s;ont le
<PB N="407" REF="428">
patrimoine de l'&eacute;tat, et nous &s;ommes l'&eacute;tat. Il e&s;t vrai qu'on vous
lai&s;&s;e les Lieutenances Baillivales; mais vous &s;avez a&s;&s;ez qu'on y m&ecirc;le
certaines &s;tipulations, de fa&ccedil;on que, &s;i le nouveau magi&s;trat ne vit
pas quelque tems, &s;a famille perd au march&eacute;.</P>
<P>Priv&eacute;s de re&s;&s;ources, que re&s;te il aux gentilhommes du Pays de
Vaud? le &s;ervice &eacute;tranger. Mais on n'a pas manqu&eacute; de leur
rendre cette carri&egrave;re des plus &eacute;pineu&s;es, et de leur y fermer l'acc&egrave;s des
grades un peu &eacute;lev&eacute;s. Je ne dirai rien du brilliant &s;ervice de France.
Les d&eacute;pen&s;es &s;ont in&eacute;vitables, et la paye &s;i modique que l'en&s;eigne &s;e|ruine,
le capitaine vit &agrave; peine, et m&ecirc;me le colonel ne peut ama&s;&s;er.
Ain&s;i vous devez b&eacute;nir le &s;oin paternel du &s;ouverain qui a dre&s;&s;&eacute;
toutes les capitulations, de mani&egrave;re &agrave; ne vous point introduire en ten|tation.
Ne parlons que du &s;ervice des Etats G&eacute;n&eacute;raux, &s;ervice plus
utile que riant, ou l'on s'ennuye et s'enrichit. Par le trait&eacute; de 1712,
le Canton de Berne accorda vingt quatre compagnies &agrave; leurs Hautes
<PB N="408" REF="429">
Pui&s;&s;ances, et promit de permettre qu'on en &s;it toujours des recrues
dans leurs &eacute;tats. Seize compagnies &eacute;toient de&s;tin&eacute;es aux Bernois, et
les &s;ouverains partageoient avec leurs &s;ujets les huit autres com|pagnies,
dont on daignoit lai&s;&s;er l'entr&eacute;e ouverte &agrave; ceux ci: ain&s;i
&agrave; ne &s;uppo&s;er le cr&eacute;dit des Bernois qu'&eacute;gal &agrave; celui des &s;ujets, pour
parvenir &agrave; ces huit derni&egrave;res compagnies, ce peuple roi en po&s;&s;ede|roit
toujours vingt, &s;ur vingt quatre. La proportion e&s;t honn&ecirc;te, &s;i
l'on fait attention qu'il y a dans le Canton pr&egrave;s de cent mille
hommes en &eacute;tat de porter les armes, dont il n'y en a pas huit cens,
bourgeois de Berne. D'ailleurs les petits bourgeois, &agrave; qui ce nom
&s;eul in&s;pire de la fiert&eacute;, aiment mieux croupir dans la mi&s;&egrave;re &agrave;
Berne, que de &s;e faire par leur travail un &eacute;tat vraiment re&s;pectable.
Ain&s;i dans toutes ces troupes, je doute qu'on pui&s;&s;e trouver cinquante
Bernois qui ne &s;oient par officiers.</P>
<P>Ces malheurs, me dites vous, ne &s;ont que pour les gentilhommes;
c'e&s;t &agrave; dire, pour la partie la plus re&s;pectable, mais la moins nom|breu&s;e,
<PB N="409" REF="430">
des citoyens. Ils s'&eacute;vanoui&s;&s;ent dans ces maximes g&eacute;n&eacute;rales
et &eacute;gales que vous venez d'&eacute;tablir. La tyrannie de vos Baillis s'y
&eacute;vanouit elle au&s;&s;i? Le peuple, nom &s;i cher &agrave; l'humanit&eacute;, en &s;ent
tout le joug. Je ne vous conterai point des hi&s;toires de leurs op|pre&s;&s;ions.
Vous me chicaneriez &s;ur la v&eacute;rit&eacute; des faits, et puis vous
me diriez, qu'il ne faut jamais conclure du particulier au g&eacute;n&eacute;ral,
et vous auriez rai&s;on. Il vaut mieux faire &s;entir l'&eacute;tendue de leur
pouvoir, et lai&s;&s;er &agrave; votre connoi&s;&s;ance du coeur humain, &agrave; juger de
l'u&s;age qu'ils en font. Chaque Bailli e&s;t &agrave; la fois chef de la ju&s;tice,
de la milice, des finances, et de la r&eacute;ligion. Comme juge, il d&eacute;cide
&s;ans appel ju&s;qu'&agrave; la &s;omme de cent francs, &s;omme tres modique
pour vous, mais qui fait la fortune d'un pay&s;an; et il d&eacute;cide &s;eul,
car &s;es a&s;&s;e&s;&s;eurs, n'ont pas voix pond&eacute;rative. Il donne, ou plut&ocirc;t
il vend, pre&s;que tous les emplois dans &s;on bailliage. Si l'on veut
appeller de &s;es &s;entences, il n'y a plus de tribunal &agrave; Moudon; il faut
aller &agrave; Berne, et quel pay&s;an veut &s;e ruiner &agrave; la pour&s;uite de la
<PB N="410" REF="431">
ju&s;tice? S'il cherche encore &agrave; faire punir &s;on tyran, il demande
l'entr&eacute;e en con&s;eil. L'Avoyer l'accorde, peut &ecirc;tre avec beaucoup
de difficult&eacute;, et &agrave; force de fatigues et de d&eacute;pen&s;es il parvient &agrave; pouvoir
plaider devant un tribunal li&eacute; avec &s;on baillif par le &s;ang, et plus
encore par une conformit&eacute; de forfaits, ou d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts.</P>
<P>Votre pays e&s;t &eacute;pui&s;&eacute; par les impots, tout modiques qu'ils &s;ont.
D&eacute;velopons cette id&eacute;e. Pendant que les pays le plus riches de
l'Europe s'abyment de d&eacute;pen&s;es et de dettes, et mettent en oeuvre des
moyens qui feroient trembler le plus hardi di&s;&s;ipateur, le Canton de
Berne e&s;t le &s;eul qui ama&s;&s;e des tr&eacute;&s;ors. Le &s;ecret de l'&eacute;tat e&s;t &s;i bien
gard&eacute;, qu'il e&s;t difficile de le deviner. Stanian, amba&s;&s;adeur d'Angle|terre
&agrave; Berne, qui avoit un e&s;prit d'ob&s;ervation et de grandes facilit&eacute;s
pour &s;e bien informer, e&s;timoit, il y a quarante ans, les &s;ommes qu'il
avoit dans les fonds publics de Londres &agrave; trois cens milles livres &s;ter|ling,
ou &s;ept millions, et tout ce qui &eacute;toit re&s;t&eacute; dans le tr&eacute;&s;or de
Berne, ou di&s;pers&eacute; dans les autres banques de l' Europe, &agrave; dix huit
<PB N="411" REF="432">
cens mille livres &s;terling, ou quarante trois millions. On peut
croire que ces tr&eacute;&s;ors n'ont pas diminu&eacute;s depuis l'an 1722. Le
moyen que le Canton employe pour s'enrichir e&s;t tr&egrave;s &s;imple. Il
d&eacute;pen&s;e beaucoup moins qu'il ne re&ccedil;oit. Mais que re&ccedil;oit il? Je
l'ignore; mais je vais tacher de le deviner. Les douze bailliages du
Pays de Vaud rendent dans leurs &s;ix ans, &agrave; peu pres cinq cens mille
livres de Sui&s;&s;e, les uns portant les autres. Le revenu de douze,
peut donc monter &agrave; un million de livres de rente. J'ai toujours
entendu dire que les Baillis prennent le dix pour cent &s;ur les
revenus du &s;ouverain. Le voil&agrave; donc ce revenu d'un million par
ann&eacute;e. En rabattant les cent mille livres des Baillis, je compterais
encore cent mille &eacute;c&ucirc;s pour les charges de l'&eacute;tat, ce qui n'e&s;t point une
&s;uppo&s;ition batie en l'air. Les autres deux cens mille ec&ucirc;s, qui dans
un autre pays, fourniroient &agrave; l'entretien d'une cour et d'une arm&eacute;e,
dont les d&eacute;pen&s;es feroient retomber &s;ur la terre la ro&s;&eacute;e qui en &eacute;toit
tir&eacute;e, vont ici s'enfouir dans les coffres du &s;ouverain, ou &s;e di&s;per&s;er

dans les banques publiques, et pr&eacute;caires de l'Europe, pour etre un
jour une proye &agrave; l'infid&eacute;lit&eacute; d'un commis, ou &agrave; l'ambition d'un con|querant.
Cette pe&s;te continuelle des e&s;peces &eacute;teint l'indu&s;trie, em|p&ecirc;che
tout effort, qui ne &s;e peut faire &s;ans argent, et appauvrit in|&s;en&s;iblement

<P>Tels &s;ont vos maux, Mon&s;ieur. Eh bien! me repondez vous,
n'avez vous &s;ond&eacute;, nos playes que pour en aigrir la douleur? Quel
con&s;eil nous donnez vous? Aucun, &s;i vous ne m'avez pas d&eacute;ja

la remontrance. Mais il y a des maux tellement enracin&eacute;s dans la
con&s;titution d'un &eacute;tat, que Platon lui m&ecirc;me n'eut pas e&s;p&eacute;r&eacute; du &s;ucc&egrave;s
pour une pareille d&eacute;putation. Ne tiendront ils pas contre les remon|trances,
eux qui ont pu tenir contre deux cens and de fid&eacute;lit&eacute; et de

glorieux: Guillaume Tell vous l'e&ucirc;t con&s;eill&eacute;; mais je ne vous le con|&s;eille

<PB N="413" REF="434">
les malheurs attach&eacute;s &agrave; la &s;oumi&s;&s;ion. Il ignore ceux que la r&eacute;&s;i&s;|tance
pourroit entrainer. Vous, qui me connoi&s;&s;ez, Mon&s;ieur, vous
&s;avez combien je re&s;pecte ces principes amis de la paix et des
hommes. Tribun &s;&eacute;ditieux, je ne chercherai jamais &agrave; faire &s;ecouer au

above all others, there mu&s;t be rea&s;ons for my preference: but, if I am not
mi&s;taken, my heart is &s;u&s;ceptible of affection for more countries than one.
Did I &s;acrifice all to Sweden, I &s;hould only pay my debt of gratitude to the
land in which I was born, and to which I owe my life and fortune. Yet
life and fortune would have been but melancholy burthens, if, after my ba|ni&s;hment
from home in early youth, your country had not formed my ta&s;te
<PB N="389" REF="410">
and rea&s;on, and taught me more refined morals than our own. I &s;hould
prove my&s;elf unworthy of this goodne&s;s, did it not in&s;pire me with the live|lie&s;t
gratitude: and now that Sweden, enjoying tranquillity under the pro|tection
of laws, requires nothing from its &s;ubjects but a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their
happine&s;s, I may direct my attention, without offence, to the Pais de Vaud,
my &s;econd country; rejoicing with you in its advantages, or commi&s;erating
its mi&s;fortunes.</P>
<P>You enjoy a fine climate, a fertile &s;oil, and have conveniencies for internal
commerce, from which great benefit might be derived. But I con&s;ider the
people rather than their territory. Philo&s;ophy flouri&s;hes in London; Paris
is the centre of tho&s;e attracted by the allurements of poli&s;hed &s;ociety. Your
country, though inferior to tho&s;e capitals, yet unites in &s;ome mea&s;ure their
re&s;pective advantages: &s;ince it is the only country who&s;e inhabitants, while
they think freely and boldly, live politely and elegantly. What then is
wanting? Liberty; and deprived of it, you have lo&s;t your all.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="411">
This truth &s;urpri&s;es and offends you. The right of complaining, you
an&s;wer, that we are not free, is a proof of our liberty. If I wrote at Lau|&s;anne,
the argument would have weight; yet even there, it would not be
convincing; for your ma&s;ters are not ignorant of Cardinal Mazarine's maxim,
and are willing to allow you to talk, provided you allow them to act; &s;o that
the proce&s;s is not yet determined.</P>
<P>If I wrote for the people I would &s;peak to their pa&s;&s;ions, and hold a lan|guage
repeated in all ages, that under republics, tho&s;e who are free are more
free, and tho&s;e who are en&s;laved, more en&s;laved, than under any other form
of government. But with a friend like you I would &s;eek only the maxims
of truth, and employ only the arguments of rea&s;on. When I compare
your condition with that of &s;urrounding nations, I can &s;incerely congratulate
you on your happine&s;s. Whenever we quit the neighbourhood of your lake
and mountains, we find men who, though worthy of a better fate, are
plunged in the mo&s;t abject &s;uper&s;tition; who&s;e property and indu&s;try are the
<PB N="391" REF="412">
&s;poils of a licentious &s;oldiery; and who&s;e lives are ready every moment to
be &s;acrificed to the caprice of one man, who, when he hears that twenty
thou&s;and of his fellow-creatures have fallen &s;acrifices to his ambition, is
contented with &s;aying coldly, "they have done their duty."</P>
<P>You, on the contrary, enjoy a Chri&s;tianity brought back to the purity of
its original principles, taught publicly by worthy mini&s;ters, who are loved
and re&s;pected, but who have it not in their power to become the objects of
fear. Your connection with the Swi&s;s cantons has pre&s;erved to you the
ble&s;&s;ings of peace two centuries; a thing unexampled in hi&s;tory. Your
taxes are moderate; and the public admini&s;tration is gentle. You have not
to complain of tho&s;e arbitrary &s;entences, which, without any form of legal
procedure, without an accu&s;er, and without a crime, have been known to
tear citizens from the bo&s;oms of their families. The &s;overeign is never
&s;een; the weight of his authority is rarely felt: yet if liberty con&s;i&s;ts in
being &s;ubject to laws, which impartially con&s;ult the intere&s;ts of all the mem|bers
of the community, you do not enjoy that ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="413">
When the inju&s;tice of &s;ome, and the weakne&s;s of others, &s;howed the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
for civil &s;ociety, individuals were obliged to renounce their beloved,
but pernicious, independence. All particular wills were melted down into
the general will of the public; by which, under the &s;anction of definite pu|ni&s;hments,
men became bound to regulate their conduct. But it is a matter
of the utmo&s;t delicacy to determine with whom that general will ought to
be depo&s;ited. Shall it re&s;ide in the brea&s;t of a prince, who thereby be|comes
ab&s;olute? I know that the true intere&s;ts of a prince can never be
&s;eparated from tho&s;e of his people, and that in exerting him&s;elf for their be|nefit,
he labours for his own. This is the language of philo&s;ophy, but it is
&s;eldom &s;poken by the preceptors of princes; and if the latter &s;ometimes
read it in their own hearts, the impre&s;&s;ion is &s;peedily effaced by contrary
pa&s;&s;ions, in them&s;elves, their confe&s;&s;ors, their mini&s;ters, or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. The
groans of the people are not &s;oon heard; and their ma&s;ter learns only by a
fatal experience, that it is the intere&s;t of a &s;hepherd to pre&s;erve his flock.
The legi&s;lative power, therefore, cannot &s;afely be entru&s;ted to a &s;ingle per|&s;on.
<PB N="393" REF="414">
A council, who&s;e members mutually in&s;truct, and mutually check
each other, appears to be its proper depo&s;itory. But in this council one
condition is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite. It mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of deputies from every or|der
in the &s;tate, intere&s;ted by their own &s;afety in oppo&s;ing every regulation
incon&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of that order to which they belong. Such a
council will rarely be guilty of gro&s;s errors; and &s;hould this &s;ometimes hap|pen,
it will &s;oon blu&s;h for, and repair them. Is this the picture of your
legi&s;lature? When I &s;urvey your country, I behold two nations, di&s;tinctly
characteri&s;ed by their rights, employments, and manners: the one, con|&s;i&s;ting
of three hundred families, born to command; the other, con&s;i&s;ting of
an hundred thou&s;and, doomed to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The former are inve&s;ted, as a
body, with all the prerogatives of hereditary monarchs, which are the more
humiliating to you their &s;ubjects, becau&s;e they belong to men apparently
your equals. The compari&s;on between your&s;elves and them is made every
moment; no circum&s;tance tends to conceal it from your fancy.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="415">
A council of three hundred per&s;ons is the &s;overeign umpire of your deare&s;t
intere&s;ts, which will always be &s;acrificed when they cla&s;h with their own.
This council is inve&s;ted with the executive, as well as the legi&s;lative, power;
two branches of authority which can never be united, without rendering each of
them too formidable to the &s;ubject. When they belong to different per&s;ons,
or a&s;&s;emblies, the legi&s;lature will not venture to form violent re&s;olutions,
becau&s;e the&s;e would be of no avail, unle&s;s they were carried into execution
by another power, always its rival, and often its antagoni&s;t. The &s;word of
authority is not only &s;harpened by this union, but is thereby confined to a
&s;maller number of hands. In the la&s;t century the great council of Bern be|gan
to elect its own members; which was a great &s;tep towards oligarchy,
&s;ince it excluded from elections the citizens at large, and thereby narrowed the
ba&s;is of the government. But this arrangement was liable to other inconve|niencies.
Intrigue, venality, and debauchery &s;ignali&s;ed the admi&s;&s;ion of citi|zens
into the &s;overeign council; and ambitious men &s;quandered their wealth,
<PB N="395" REF="416">
that they might purcha&s;e a right to indulge their rapacity. A committee of
&s;ix coun&s;ellors, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the infancy of the republic, to watch the exe|cution
of the laws, and who&s;e offices were held at plea&s;ure, became entru&s;ted
with the power of naming the members of the grand council, by which this
committee it&s;elf was appointed. Its number was augmented by &s;ixteen &s;e|nators,
cho&s;en in the manner mo&s;t favourable to the de&s;igns of faction. They
exerci&s;ed their power at fir&s;t collectively, but by degrees they came to un|der&s;tand
that their particular intere&s;ts would be better promoted by each
naming his &s;on, &s;on-in-law, or kin&s;man. The powerful families which then
commanded the &s;enate, &s;till rule in it at pre&s;ent. Thirty places are filled by
the Wattevilles and Steiguers. This &s;elfi&s;h traffic, by which the members of
the little council are elected by the great council, con&s;i&s;ting of their own rela|tions,
that they may name other relations to &s;eats in the great council, has re|duced
the number of families, which have a right to &s;it in the latter, to nearly
four&s;core. The&s;e princely families look down with equal contempt on tho&s;e
who are their fellow-citizens by the law of nature, and tho&s;e who were ren|dered
<PB N="396" REF="417">
&s;uch by the con&s;titution of their country. The former cla&s;s is deprived
of a re&s;ources which the mo&s;t ab&s;olute princes have &s;eldom ventured to wre&s;t
from their &s;ubjects; I mean tho&s;e courts of ju&s;tice acknowledged by the
prince, and revered by the people, as the organs of public opinion, and the
depo&s;itories of the laws. The commands of the &s;overeign are obeyed with
cheerfulne&s;s only when their propriety is confirmed by the approbation of
tho&s;e tribunals, who&s;e members it has been found difficult either to deceive,
to &s;educe, or to intimidate. Their re&s;i&s;tance to oppre&s;&s;ion is re&s;pectful, but
firm; and in exerting it, they di&s;play that warmth of eloquence with which
rea&s;on and liberty in&s;pire good citizens. In the members of tho&s;e peaceful
tribunals, &s;uch qualities appear in their greate&s;t lu&s;tre. De&s;titute of arms,
their whole &s;trength lies in their talents and their probity. What noble
le&s;&s;ons to kings have been given by the parliament of Paris? What excel|lent
examples to &s;ubjects are &s;et by the Mandarines of China? Monarchs
<HI>mu&s;t</HI> hear the groans of their people, when &s;uch re&s;pectable bodies of men
<PB N="397" REF="418">
are their organs. The people too learn that they have a country, which
they will begin to love, to &s;tudy its laws, and to form them&s;elves to public
virtues. The&s;e virtues ripen &s;ilently; they are exerted when an opportunity
offers; and &s;ometimes they will make an opportunity for their own exhibi|tion.
In the Pa&iuml;s de Vaud, which was equally re&s;pectable under the kings
of Burgundy and the dukes of Savoy, the &s;tates formed &s;uch a tribunal.
They were compo&s;ed of the nobility, clergy, and deputies from the principal
cities, which annually a&s;&s;embled at Moudon, and formed the perpetual
council of the prince, without who&s;e con&s;ent he could neither enact new
laws, nor impo&s;e new taxes. Were I on the &s;pot, I could prove the exi&s;t|ence
of tho&s;e rights by your mo&s;t authentic records. At a di&s;tance I can
only appeal to their te&s;timony, and employ an analogical proof, which will
be &s;ufficiently convincing to men of letters. The Barbarians, who over|flowed
Europe in the fifth century, every where laid the foundation of that
form of government which Charlemagne e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Low Countries,
France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. The different modes of tenure
<PB N="398" REF="419">
which were at different times introduced, the various degrees of dependance
which one fief came to have on another, the acqui&s;ition of lord&s;hips by the
clergy, and the purcha&s;e of franchi&s;es by cities; all the&s;e circum&s;tances occa|&s;ioned
but &s;light differences in the ground-work of the con&s;titution, which
remained unalterably founded on a firm ba&s;is of liberty. The &s;tates, their
members, and their rights, were invariably maintained; remaining uniformly
the &s;ame at all times, and in all places.</P>
<P>I think that I hear you, my friend, interrupting me. Hitherto, you &s;ay,
I have li&s;tened to you with patience; but what is your conclu&s;ion from this
picture of our government? Whatever defects there may be in its prin|ciples,
we have experienced its &s;alutary con&s;equences; and the &s;tates and
a&s;&s;emblies which you &s;o much commend, will not ea&s;ily make us aboli&s;h our
ancient magi&s;tracies, in order to try innovations.</P>
<P>It is time, Sir, to pau&s;e; I &s;poke to you as became a freeman, and you
an&s;wer me in the language of &s;lavery. Let us admit for a moment your
pro&s;perity; to whom do you owe it? You will not an&s;wer, to the con&s;titu|tion.
<PB N="399" REF="420">
It is due then to your rulers. The Romans owed a pro&s;perity yet
greater to Titus; but &s;till remained the ba&s;e&s;t of &s;laves. Brutus would have
taught you that a de&s;pot may &s;ometimes choo&s;e to promote the public hap|pine&s;s;
but that the magi&s;trates of a free people can have no other wi&s;h.
The advantages actually enjoyed by a citizen and a &s;lave may be the &s;ame;
but tho&s;e of the latter are precarious, having no other foundation than the
changeable pa&s;&s;ions of men; whereas tho&s;e of the former are &s;ecure, being
&s;olidly &s;upported on tho&s;e laws which curb guilty pa&s;&s;ions in the prince as
well as in the pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>But unfortunately too many faults may be &s;ound in your public admini|&s;tration.
I &s;hall give you the black li&s;t of omi&s;&s;ions and oppre&s;&s;ions, which,
notwith&s;tanding that you will exclaim again&s;t my malignity, your own me|mory
will augment by an hundred articles, which I may be either ignorant
of, or forget to mention. It is the duty of a &s;overeign to procure for
his people all the happine&s;s of which their condition is &s;u&s;ceptible. His
public &s;pirited exertions may be &s;u&s;pended by the exigencies of defen&s;ive
<PB N="400" REF="421">
war; but as &s;oon as peace is re&s;tored, he will be continually and u&s;efully
occupied with the intere&s;ts of religion, laws, morals, &s;ciences, police, com|merce,
and agriculture. Let us try the merits of the &s;enate of Bern by
the&s;e maxims. The members of this &s;enate have been ma&s;ters of the Pa&iuml;s
de Vaud &s;ince the year one thou&s;and five hundred and thirty-&s;ix. When we
con&s;ider the deplorable condition in tho&s;e days of France, England, Hol|land,
and Germany, we can &s;carcely imagine that they were the &s;ame coun|tries
with tho&s;e re&s;pectively known at pre&s;ent by the &s;ame names. Their
barbari&s;m has been civilized, their ignorance enlightened, their poverty en|riched;
their de&s;erts have become cities, and their fore&s;ts now wave with
yellow harve&s;ts. The&s;e wonders have been effected by their princes and
mini&s;ters: a Henry the Fourth, a Sully, a Colbert, an Elizabeth, a de Witt,
and a Frederick William. The comparative condition of the Pa&iuml;s de Vaud
at tho&s;e two remote aeras, does not pre&s;ent &s;o plea&s;ing a picture. There
the arts &s;till langui&s;h, for want of tho&s;e encouragements which princes
only can be&s;tow: the country is &s;till de&s;titute of commerce and manufac|tures:
we hear not of any projects for promoting the public pro&s;perity: we
<PB N="401" REF="422">
&s;ee nothing but the marks of an univer&s;al lethargy. Yet the princes above
mentioned had but moments for executing their great de&s;igns; the &s;enators
of Bern have had ages. What benefits might not tho&s;e patriotic kings
have conferred on their &s;ubjects, if, in&s;tead of having their thrones conti|nually
&s;haken by war and &s;edition, they had enjoyed during two centuries
the advantage of having loyal &s;ubjects and pacific neighbours? I appeal to
your&s;elf; point out a &s;ingle u&s;eful e&s;tabli&s;hment which the Pa&iuml;s de Vaud owes
to the &s;overeignty of Bern: but do not tell me of the academy of Lau&s;anne,
founded on motives of religion during the zeal of reformation, but &s;ince
totally neglected, though a worthy magi&s;trate of that city propo&s;ed the laud|able
de&s;ign of erecting it into an univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Your ma&s;ters err not through ignorance. They are not deficient, I
know, in political abilities. But while a prince treats with impartial bounty
all his &s;ubjects, the citizens of an ari&s;tocratical capital are apt to behold with
jealou&s;y the improvement of the provinces. Their elevation, they think,
mu&s;t pave the way for their own downfal; and if they become their equals
in point of knowledge and riches, they will &s;oon be tempted, they imagine,
<PB N="402" REF="423">
to a&s;pire at an equality with them&s;elves in power. Recal to memory the
year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and eighty-five; when the wretched policy of
Louis the Fourteenth drove from their country the mo&s;t indu&s;trious portion
of his &s;ubjects, many of whom &s;ought refuge in the Pa&iuml;s de Vaud; a neigh|bouring
di&s;trict, and &s;peaking their own language. They reque&s;ted only
an a&s;ylum, the benefits of which they would richly have repaid by the wealth
which they carried with them, and their &s;kill in manufactures, &s;till more va|luable.
But the narrow policy of Bern took the alarm. <Q>If we make
the&s;e men citizens of Bern, their intere&s;ts will coincide with our own.
But is it fit that mortals &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the rank of gods? If they
are mixed with the ma&s;s of our &s;ubjects, our &s;ubjects will be enriched by
their indu&s;try.</Q> They concluded therefore, with the amba&s;&s;adors of Por|&s;enna&mdash;
<Q>that it was more de&s;irable for a prince to govern a poor but &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive
people, than to contend with the unruly pa&s;&s;ions of men pam|pered
by pro&s;perity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="424">
The emigrants, di&s;gu&s;ted at being repeatedly refu&s;ed what they ought to
have been reque&s;ted to accept, travelled to Holland, Pru&s;&s;ia, and England,
who&s;e rulers had the good &s;en&s;e to avail them&s;elves of an emergency as fa|vourable
as it was &s;ingular. A part of them indeed remained in the Pa&iuml;s
de Vaud, but the poore&s;t and the idle&s;t, who had neither money nor &s;pirit
to travel farther.</P>
<P>The&s;e unhappy fugitives had no &s;ooner begun to forget their pa&s;t &s;uffer|ings,
than they learned by fatal experience that, in order to avoid per&s;e|cution,
it was nece&s;&s;ary to fly from the &s;ociety of men. The &s;overeigns of
the country in which they had &s;ettled had imbibed the &s;evere &s;y&s;tem of Cal|vin,
a &s;tern theologian, who loved liberty too well, to endure that Chri&s;tians
&s;hould wear any other chains than tho&s;e impo&s;ed by him&s;elf. His near con|formity
in opinion with a celebrated German philo&s;opher, intere&s;ted the ho|nour
of the German name in &s;upporting his doctrines. But in the Pa&iuml;s
de Vaud the a&s;perity of religious opinions had &s;oftened with the improve|ment
of &s;ociety. It became nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to &s;end thither formulas
<PB N="404" REF="425">
and inqui&s;itors, de&s;igned to make as many hypocrites as po&s;&s;ible, not indeed
by fire and &s;word, but by threats and depo&s;ition from office.</P>
<P>In &s;upporting the rights of man, I would not carry too far the maxims
of toleration. It is ju&s;t that public rewards &s;hould be be&s;towed only on tho&s;e
who teach the religion of the public; and tho&s;e bold innovators, who would
impart a dangerous light to the people, may very properly be re&s;trained by
the arm of the magi&s;trate. But it &s;urely is ab&s;urd, that the &s;overeign &s;hould
interfere in theological minutiae, and take part warmly in que&s;tions which
are incapable of being decided. It is particularly unju&s;t, that he &s;hould
impo&s;e confe&s;&s;ions of &s;aith on old mini&s;ters, who wi&s;h to avoid di&s;putation;
leaving them the mi&s;erable alternative of fal&s;ehood or beggary. But this
per&s;ecution has now cea&s;ed. What put an end to it? It was not &s;hame,
nor the tears of the people, but the boldne&s;s of Davel, that meritorious en|thu&s;ia&s;t.
Even to the pre&s;ent day, a &s;ecret inqui&s;ition &s;till reigns at Lau|&s;anne;
where the names of Arminian and Socinian are often mentioned in
<PB N="405" REF="426">
the letters written by very hone&s;t people to their patrons of Bern; and
offices are often given or withheld according to the reports made of the reli|gious
tenets of the candidates.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e &s;trictures on your legi&s;lature, which by no means ex|hau&s;t
the &s;ubject, I proceed to con&s;ider the defects of your executive power;
which is the public force, as the legi&s;lature ought to be the public will. But
a &s;ingle council, or a &s;ingle man, may deliberate and re&s;olve for a whole
nation; the executive power, on the contrary, requires the exertions of many:
as it is compo&s;ed of a great variety of branches, many officers, &s;ubordinate
one to the other, mu&s;t actuate the different parts of the machine, to which
the chief magi&s;trate can only communicate the fir&s;t general movement. The
honours and emoluments legally attached to &s;uch offices, ought to be open
to all tho&s;e citizens who are properly qualified for di&s;charging them. Each
individual, as he bears a &s;hare of the public burdens, is entitled al&s;o to a
&s;hare of the public rewards. This ju&s;t arrangement is ea&s;ily maintained in
monarchies; where, with the exception of a few courtiers, who, by being
<PB N="406" REF="427">
continually about the prince's per&s;on, have an opportunity of &s;ub&s;tituting
flattery in&s;tead of real &s;ervices, all the inhabitants of the kingdom are treated
with comparative equity. In France, provided a man has court-favour
or merit, the que&s;tion is never a&s;ked whether he comes from Provence or
Normandy. D'Epernon was born in Ga&s;cony; Richelieu, in Champagne;
Mazarine, in Rome. But in ari&s;tocratical republics, the citizens of one
town are not contented with being &s;overeigns collectively, unle&s;s they indi|vidually
appropriate all offices of honour or emolument. In the canton of
Bern talents and information are not of the &s;malle&s;t u&s;e to any one who is
not born in the capital; and in another &s;en&s;e they are u&s;ele&s;s to tho&s;e born
there; becau&s;e they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> make their way without them. Their &s;ubjects in
the Pa&iuml;s de Vaud are condemned, by the circum&s;tances of their birth, to a
condition of &s;hameful ob&s;curity. They naturally become, therefore, a prey
to de&s;pair; and neglecting to cultivate talents which they can never enjoy an
opportunity to di&s;play, tho&s;e who had capacities for becoming great men are
contented with making them&s;elves agreeable companions. Should I propo&s;e
that the &s;ubjects obtained a right to hold the lucrative employments of
<PB N="407" REF="428">
<HI>Baillis,</HI> or governors of di&s;tricts, the ari&s;tocratical families of Bern would
think me guilty of a crime little le&s;s than &s;acrilege. <Q>The emoluments of
the&s;e offices form the patrimony of the &s;tate; and we are the &s;tate.</Q> It
is true, that you in the Pa&iuml;s de Vaud may be deputies to the Baillis; but the
advantages belonging to that &s;ubordinate magi&s;tracy are obtained on certain
conditions, which, unle&s;s the holder of the office lives a certain number of
years, renders his bargain a very bad one for his family.</P>
<P>What encouragement is then left for the gentlemen of the Pa&iuml;s de Vaud?
That of foreign &s;ervice. But to them, even this road to preferment is ex|tremely
difficult, and to attain the higher ranks is impo&s;&s;ible. I &s;peak not
of the brilliant &s;ervice of France: in that country, expence is unavoidable;
the en&s;ign is ruined, the captain can &s;carcely live, and the colonel cannot
&s;ave money. You are therefore obliged to the paternal care of the magi|&s;trates
of Bern, who&s;e treaties for &s;upplying troops to France do not lead
you into temptation. Let us only con&s;ider the &s;ervice of Holland, a &s;ervice
more profitable than &s;howy, where officers have nothing to do but to grow
rich. By the treaty of 1712, the Canton of Bern granted the u&s;e of twenty-four
<PB N="408" REF="429">
companies to their High Mightine&s;&s;es, and promi&s;ed that they &s;hould al|ways
be allowed to recruit them in their territories. But the command of
&s;ixteen of tho&s;e companies was appropriated by the citizens of Bern, and the
remaining eight were left common between them and their &s;ubjects in the
Pa&iuml;s de Vaud. On the &s;uppo&s;ition, then, that the intere&s;t of both cla&s;&s;es of
candidates for tho&s;e companies is equal, the &s;overeign people will obtain
four out of the eight, and twenty out of the whole twenty-four. This pro|portion
appears the more unrea&s;onable, when it is con&s;idered that in the can|ton
there are above an hundred thou&s;and men &s;it to bear arms, of whom
&s;carcely eight hundred are citizens of Bern. Be&s;ides, the poorer cla&s;&s;es of
citizens, proud merely of this title, prefer living in idlene&s;s at Bern to ho|nourable
exertions abroad, by which they might better their condition.
I doubt, therefore, whether fifty citizens of Bern, who are not officers, will
be found in the whole of the Swi&s;s Dutch troops.</P>
<P>The&s;e inconveniencies, you will tell me, are only felt by men of family;
that is to &s;ay, by the mo&s;t re&s;pectable, but lea&s;t numerous, portion of the
<PB N="409" REF="430">
community; and they di&s;appear amid&s;t the general equity and impartiality
of the public admini&s;tration. But does the tyranny of the <HI>bailiffs</HI> di&s;appear
al&s;o? The people, a name &s;o dear to humanity, feel the full weight of
their oppre&s;&s;ion. I will not have recour&s;e to particular examples; becau&s;e
you might call in que&s;tion the authenticity of facts, or object with rea&s;on,
that general conclu&s;ions are not to be drawn from particular principles. I
&s;hall be contented with pointing out the extent of their power, and leave to
your own knowledge of human nature to infer the abu&s;es with which it mu&s;t
be accompanied. In his own di&s;trict every bailiff is at the head of religion,
of the law, the army, and the finances. As judge, he decides, without appeal,
all cau&s;es to the amount of an hundred franks; a &s;um of little importance
to a gentleman, but which often makes the whole fortune of a pea&s;ant; and
he decides alone, for the voice of his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors has not any weight in the
&s;cale. He confers, or rather he &s;ells, all the employments in his di&s;trict.
When the injured party wi&s;hes to appeal from his &s;entence, as there is no
court of ju&s;tice at Moudon, he is obliged to remove the cau&s;e to Bern; and
<PB N="410" REF="431">
how few pea&s;ants can bear this expence? But if his eagerne&s;s to puni&s;h his
tyrant carries him thither, it is not without many difficulties on his part that
the Avoyer, or chief magi&s;trate, grants him admi&s;&s;ion into the council; where,
after all his trouble and expence, he is finally allowed to plead his cau&s;e be|fore
a tribunal, the members of which are connected with his oppre&s;&s;or by
the ties of blood, and &s;till more by a conformity of intere&s;ts and crimes.</P>
<P>Your taxes, moderate as they are, exhau&s;t the country. This ob&s;ervation
requires to be explained. While the great kingdoms of Europe, loaded
with expences and debts, are driven to expedients which would alarm the
wilde&s;t prodigal, Bern is the only &s;tate which has ama&s;&s;ed a large trea&s;ure.
The &s;ecret has been &s;o well kept, that it is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain its amount.
Stanyan, the Briti&s;h envoy at Bern, a man inqui&s;itive and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
good means of information, e&s;timated forty years ago the money belonging
to that republic, in the Engli&s;h funds, at three hundred thou&s;and pounds, or
&s;even millions of Swi&s;s livres; and the &s;ums remaining in the trea&s;ury of
Bern, or di&s;per&s;ed through the other funds or banks of Europe, at eighteen
<PB N="411" REF="432">
hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, or forty-three millions Swi&s;s. The&s;e trea|&s;ures
have not probably dimini&s;hed &s;ince the year 1722. The Canton en|riches
it&s;elf by the &s;imple means of receiving much and expending little.
But what is the amount of its receipts? I know not, but I will try to di&s;|cover
it. The twelve bailiwics, or di&s;tricts, of the Pa&iuml;s de Vaud pay, one
with another, during the &s;ix years that they are governed by the &s;ame ma|gi&s;trate,
five hundred thou&s;and Swi&s;s livres. The contributions, therefore
of all the twelve amount to a million of livres annually, I have always
been told that the bailiffs, or governors, retain ten <HI>per cent.</HI> on the reve|nues
rai&s;ed within their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions. The million of revenue,
dimini&s;hed by an hundred thou&s;and livres con&s;umed in the appointments of
the <HI>bailiffs,</HI> is reduced to three hundred thou&s;and crowns; of which one
hundred thou&s;and may be allowed for the expences of the &s;tate, a &s;um not
cho&s;en at random; and the other two hundred thou&s;and crowns, which in
other countries would be employed in the maintenance of a court and army,
who&s;e incomes would circulate through the general ma&s;s of the people on
whom they had been rai&s;ed, are here buried in the coffers of the &s;overeignty,
<PB N="412" REF="433">
or di&s;per&s;ed through the precarious banks of Europe, to become one day
a prey to the knavery of a clerk, or the ambition of a conqueror. This con|tinual
ab&s;orption of &s;pecie extingui&s;hes indu&s;try, deadens every enterpri&s;e
that requires the aid of money, and gradually impoveri&s;hes the country.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are your hard&s;hips. But I think you will &s;ay to me, <Q>Have
you thus probed our wounds merely to make us feel their &s;mart? What
advice do you give us?</Q> None, unle&s;s you have already anticipated
it. I would indeed advi&s;e you to remon&s;trate. But there are evils &s;o deeply
rooted in governments, that Plato him&s;elf would de&s;pair of curing them.
What could you expect to obtain from tho&s;e ma&s;ters by remon&s;trances, who
have remained during two centuries in&s;en&s;ible to the merit of your faithful &s;er|vice?
There is another remedy, more prompt, more perfect, and more glori|ous.
William Tell would have pre&s;cribed it; I do not. I know that the &s;pirit
of a good citizen is, like that of charity, long-&s;uffering, and hoping all things.
The citizen is in the right; &s;ince he knows the evils re&s;ulting from his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="413" REF="434">
but knows not the greater evils which might be produced by his
re&s;i&s;tance. You know me too well to be ignorant how much I re&s;pect tho&s;e
principles, &s;o friendly to the intere&s;ts of peace and of human kind. I will
never, in the language of a &s;editious tribune, per&s;uade the people to &s;hake
off the yoke of authority, that they may proceed from murmur to &s;edition,
from &s;edition to anarchy, and from anarchy perhaps to de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>Yet, with the freedom which has hitherto guided my pen, I will endea|vour
to de&s;troy &s;ome giants of romance, which might otherwi&s;e in&s;pire you
with vain terror. Whether you prefer the road of bold enterpri&s;e or cautious
repo&s;e, I wi&s;h that rea&s;on, not prejudice, &s;hould dictate your choice.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates of Bern have a right to expect your obedience: you fear
to do them wrong in withholding it.</P>

<P>FEAR no reproaches for your negligence, however great; for your
&s;ilence, however long. I love you too well to make you any.
Nothing, in my opinion, is &s;o ridiculous as &s;ome kind of friends,
wives, and lovers, who look on no crime as &s;o heinous as the letting
&s;lip a po&s;t without writing. The charm of friend&s;hip is liberty; and
he that would de&s;troy the one, de&s;troys, without de&s;igning it, the
better half of the other. I compare friend&s;hip to charity, and letters
to alms; the la&s;t &s;ignifies nothing without the fir&s;t, and very often
the fir&s;t is very &s;trong, although it does not &s;hew it&s;elf by the other.
It is not good-will which is wanting, it is only opportunities or
means. However, one month&mdash;two months&mdash;three months&mdash;four
months&mdash;I began not to be angry, but to be unea&s;y, for fear &s;ome
accident had happened to you. I was often on the point of writing,
but was always &s;topped by the hopes of hearing from you the next
po&s;t. Be&s;ides, not to flatter you, your excu&s;e is a very bad one.
<HI>You cannot entertain me by your letters.</HI> I think I ought to know
that better than you; and I a&s;&s;ure you that one of <HI>your plain &s;incere
letters</HI> entertains me more than the mo&s;t poli&s;hed one of Pliny or
Cicero. 'Tis your heart &s;peaks, and I look on your heart as much
better in its way than either of their heads.</P>
<P>Out of pure politene&s;s I ought to talk of **** ********
before my&s;elf. I was &s;ome hours with him in this place, that is to
&s;ay, almo&s;t all the time he was here. I find him always ***
****, always good-natured, always amu&s;ing, and always trifling.
I a&s;ked him &s;ome que&s;tions about Italy; he told me, he hurried out
<PB N="415" REF="436">
of it as &s;oon as he could, becau&s;e there was no French comedy, and
he did not love the Italian opera. I let &s;lip &s;ome words of the
plea&s;ure he &s;hould have of &s;eeing his native country again, on
account of the &s;ervices he could render her in parliament. <Q>Yes
(&s;ays he), I want va&s;tly to be at London; there are three years
&s;ince I have &s;een Garrick.</Q> He &s;poke to me of you, and indeed
not only with con&s;ideration, but with affection. Were there nothing
el&s;e valuable in his character, I &s;hould love him, becau&s;e he loves
you. He told me he intended to &s;ee you as &s;oon as he &s;hould be in
England; I am glad he has kept his word. I was &s;o taken up with
my old friend, that I could not &s;peak a word to * * *.
He appeared, however, a good, &s;en&s;ible, mode&s;t young man. Poor
Minorca indeed thus lo&s;t! but poor Engli&s;hmen who have lo&s;t it!
I think the &s;econd exclamation &s;till &s;tronger than the fir&s;t. Poor
Lord Torrington! I can't help pitying him. What a &s;hameful
uncle he has! I &s;hall lo&s;e all my opinion of my countrymen, if the
whole nation, Whigs, Tories, Courtiers, Jacobites, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
are not unanimous in dete&s;ting that man. Pray, is there any truth
in a &s;tory we had here, of a brother of Admiral Byng's having
killed him&s;elf out of rage and &s;hame? I did not think he had any
brothers alive. It is thought here that Byng will be acquitted. I
hope not. Though I do not love ra&s;h judgments, I cannot help
thinking him guilty.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me, when I &s;hall come into England? How &s;hould I know
it? The 14th of June I wrote to my father, and &s;aying nothing of
my return, which I knew would have been to no purpo&s;e, I de|&s;ired
him to give me a fixed allowance of 200l. a-year, or, at lea&s;t,
to allow me a &s;ervant. No an&s;wer. About a fortnight ago I re|newed
my reque&s;t; and I cannot yet know what will be my &s;ucce&s;s.
I de&s;ign to make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, to keep quiet during this win|ter,
and to put in u&s;e all my machines next &s;pring, in order to come

dutiful letter I can imagine to my father. If all that produces no
effect, I don't know what I can do.</P>
<P>You talk to me of my cou&s;in Elli&s;on's wedding; but you don't
&s;ay a word of who &s;he is married to. Is it Elliot? Though you
have not &s;een my father yet, I &s;uppo&s;e you have heard of him.
How was he in town? His wife, was &s;he with him? Has marriage
produced any changement in his way of living? Is he to be always
at Beriton, or will he come up to London in winter? Pray have
you ever &s;een my mother-in-law, or heard any thing more of her
character? Compliments to every body that makes me compliments:
to the Gilberts, to the Comarques, to Lord Newnham, &amp;c. When
you &s;ee the Comarques again, a&s;k them if they did not know, at
Putney, Mon&s;ieur la Vabre, and his daughters; perhaps you know
them your&s;elf. I &s;aw them lately in this country; one of them very
well married.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;hman who lodges in our hou&s;e, is little &s;ociable at lea&s;t
for a rea&s;onable per&s;on. My health always good, my &s;tudies pretty
good. I under&s;tand Greek pretty well. I have even &s;ome kind of
corre&s;pondence with &s;everal learned men, with Mr. Crevier of Paris,
with Mr. Breitinger of Zurick, and with Mr. Allamand, a clergy|man
of this country, the mo&s;t rea&s;onable divine I ever knew. Do
you never read now? I am a little piqued that you &s;ay nothing of
Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; if you have not read it yet, read it for my
&s;ake. Perhaps Clari&s;&s;a does not encourage you; but, in my opinion,
it is much &s;uperior to Clari&s;&s;a. When you have read it, read the
letters of Madame de Sevign&eacute; to her daughter; I don't doubt of
their being tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h. They are properly what I called
<PB N="417" REF="438">
in the beginning of my letter, letters of the heart; the natural ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of a mother's fondne&s;s; regret at their being at a great di&s;|tance
from one another, and continual &s;chemes to get together again.
All that, won't it plea&s;e you? There is &s;carce any thing el&s;e in &s;ix
whole volumes: and notwith&s;tanding that, few people read them
without finding them too &s;hort. Adieu: my paper is at an end.

<P>AN addre&s;s in writing, from a per&s;on who has the plea&s;ure of
being with you every day, may appear &s;ingular. However, I
have preferred this method, as upon paper I can &s;peak without a
blu&s;h, and be heard without interruption. If my letter di&s;plea&s;es
you, impute it, dear Sir, only to your&s;elf. You have treated me,
not like a &s;on, but like a friend. Can you be &s;urpri&s;ed that I &s;hould
communicate to a friend, all my thoughts, and all my de&s;ires? Unle&s;s
the friend approve them, let the father never know them; or at
lea&s;t, let him know at the &s;ame time, that however rea&s;onable, how|ever
eligible, my &s;cheme may appear to me, I would rather forget
it for ever, than cau&s;e him the &s;lighte&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t returned to England, attentive to my future intere&s;t,
you were &s;o good as to give me hopes of a &s;eat in parliament. This
&s;eat, it was &s;uppo&s;ed would be an expence of fifteen hundred pounds.
This de&s;ign flattered my vanity, as it might enable me to &s;hine
in &s;o augu&s;t an a&s;&s;embly. It flattered a nobler pa&s;&s;ion; I promi&s;ed
my&s;elf that by the means of this &s;eat I might be one day the in&s;tru|ment
of &s;ome good to my country. But I &s;oon perceived how little
a mere virtuous inclination, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by talents, could contribute
towards that great end; and a very &s;hort examination di&s;covered to
me, that tho&s;e talents had not fallen to my lot. Do not, dear Sir,
impute this declaration to a fal&s;e mode&s;ty, the meane&s;t &s;pecies of
pride. Whatever el&s;e I may be ignorant of, I think I know my&s;elf,
and &s;hall always endeavour to mention my good qualities without
vanity, and my defects without repugnance. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of
the mo&s;t intimate acquaintance with his country and language, &s;o ab|&s;olutely
<PB N="419" REF="440">
nece&s;&s;ary to every &s;enator. Since they may be acquired, to
alledge my deficiency in them, would &s;eem only the plea of lazine&s;s.
But I &s;hall &s;ay with great truth, that I never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that gift of
&s;peech, the fir&s;t requi&s;ite of an orator, which u&s;e and labour may
improve, but which nature alone can be&s;tow. That my temper,
quiet, retired, &s;omewhat re&s;erved, could neither acquire popularity,
bear up again&s;t oppo&s;ition, nor mix with ea&s;e in the crowds of public
life. That even my genius (if you will allow me any) is better
qualified for the deliberate compo&s;itions of the clo&s;et, than for the
extemporary di&s;cour&s;es of the parliament. An unexpected objection
would di&s;concert me; and as I am incapable of explaining to others,
what I do not thoroughly under&s;tand my&s;elf, I &s;hould be meditating,
while I ought to be an&s;wering. I even want nece&s;&s;ary prejudices of
party, and of nation. In popular a&s;&s;emblies, it is often nece&s;&s;ary to
in&s;pire them; and never orator in&s;pired well a pa&s;&s;ion, which he did
not feel him&s;elf. Suppo&s;e me even mi&s;taken in my own character;
to &s;et out with the repugnance &s;uch an opinion mu&s;t produce, offers
but an indifferent pro&s;pect. But I hear you &s;ay, it is not nece&s;&s;ary
that every man &s;hould enter into parliament with &s;uch exalted hopes.
It is to acquire a title the mo&s;t glorious of any in a free country, and
to employ the weight and con&s;ideration it gives, in the &s;ervice of
one's friends. Such motives, though not glorious, yet are not di&s;|honourable;
and if we had a borough in our command, if you
could bring me in without any great expence, or if our fortune en|abled
us to de&s;pi&s;e that expence, then indeed I &s;hould think them
of the greate&s;t &s;trength. But with our private fortune, is it worth
while to purcha&s;e at &s;o high a rate, a title, honourable in it&s;elf, but
which I mu&s;t &s;hare with every fellow that can lay out fifteen hundred
pounds? Be&s;ides, dear Sir, a merchandi&s;e is of little value to the
owner, when he is re&s;olved not to &s;ell it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould affront your penetration, did I not &s;uppo&s;e you now &s;ee
the drift of this letter. It is to appropriate to another u&s;e the &s;um
<PB N="420" REF="441">
with which you de&s;tined to bring me into parliament; to employ it,
not in making me great, but in rendering me happy. I have often
heard you &s;ay your&s;elf, that the allowance you had been &s;o indulgent
as to grant me, though very liberal in regard to your e&s;tate, was yet
but &s;mall, when compared with the almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary extravagancies
of the age. I have indeed found it &s;o, notwith&s;tanding a good deal
of oeconomy, and an exemption from many of the common ex|pences
of youth. This, dear Sir, would be a way of &s;upplying
the&s;e deficiencies, without any additional expence to you.&mdash;But I
forbear.&mdash;If you think my propo&s;als rea&s;onable, you want no en|treaties
to engage you to comply with them; if otherwi&s;e, all will
be without effect.</P>
<P>All that I am afraid of, dear Sir, is, that I &s;hould &s;eem not &s;o
much a&s;king a favour, as this really is, as exacting a debt. After
all I can &s;ay, you will &s;till remain the be&s;t judge of my good, and
your own circum&s;tances. Perhaps, like mo&s;t landed gentlemen,
an addition to my annuity would &s;uit you better, than a &s;um of
money given at once; perhaps the &s;um it&s;elf may be too con&s;ider|able.
Whatever you &s;hall think proper to be&s;tow upon me, or in
whatever manner, will be received with equal gratitude.</P>
<P>I intended to &s;top here; but as I abhor the lea&s;t appearance of art,
I think it will be better to lay open my whole &s;cheme at once. The
unhappy war which now de&s;olates Europe, will oblige me to defer
&s;eeing France till a peace. But that rea&s;on can have no influence
upon Italy, a country which every &s;cholar mu&s;t long to &s;ee; &s;hould
you grant my reque&s;t, and not di&s;approve of my manner of em|ploying
your bounty, I would leave England this Autumn, and
pa&s;s the Winter at Lau&s;anne, with M. de Voltaire and my old
friends. The armies no longer ob&s;truct my pa&s;&s;age, and it mu&s;t be
indifferent to you, whether I am at Lau&s;anne or at London during
the Winter, &s;ince I &s;hall not be at Beriton. In the Spring I would
cro&s;s the Alps, and after &s;ome &s;tay in Italy, as the war mu&s;t then
<PB N="421" REF="442">
be terminated, return home through France; to live happily with
you and my dear mother. I am now two-and-twenty; a tour mu&s;t
take up a con&s;iderable time, and though I believe you have no
thoughts of &s;ettling me &s;oon, (and I am &s;ure I have not,) yet &s;o
many things may intervene, that the man who does not travel early,
runs a great ri&s;k of not travelling at all. But this part of my
&s;cheme, as well as the whole, I &s;ubmit entirely to you.</P>
<P>Permit me, dear Sir, to add, that I do not know whether the com|plete
compliance with my wi&s;hes could increa&s;e my love and gra|titude;
but that I am very &s;ure, no refu&s;al could dimini&s;h tho&s;e &s;en|timents

<P>I read with as much eagerne&s;s as plea&s;ure the excellent and agreeable work
with which the author pre&s;ented me. I &s;peak as if Mr. Gibbon had not

who loves them for their own &s;ake, without exception or prejudice; and
who unites with much talent the more precious gift of good &s;en&s;e, and an

<HEAD>N^o XIV. GEO. LEWIS SCOTT E&s;quire to EDWARD GIBBON junior.</HEAD>
<P>SUPPOSING you &s;ettled in quarters, dear Sir, I obey your com|mands,
and &s;end you my thoughts, relating to the pur&s;uit of your
mathematical &s;tudies. You told me, you had read Clairaut's Alge|bra,
and the three fir&s;t books of l'Hopital's Conic Sections. You
did not mention the Elements of Geometry you had peru&s;ed. What|ever
they were, whether Euclid's, or by &s;ome other, you will do
well, if you have not applied your&s;elf that way for &s;ome time
pa&s;t, to go over them again, and render the conclu&s;ions familiar to
your memory. You may defer, however, a very critical inquiry
into the principles and rea&s;oning of geometers, till Dr. Simp&s;on's
new edition of Euclid (now in the pre&s;s) appears. I would have
you &s;tudy that book well; in the mean time recapitulate Clairaut
and l'Hopital, &s;o far as you have gone, and then go through the re|mainder
of the marquis's books with care. The fifth book will be
an Introduction to the <HI>Analy&s;e des Infiniment petits;</HI> to which I
would advi&s;e you to proceed, after fini&s;hing the Conic Sections. The
<HI>Infiniment petits</HI> may want a comment; Crou&s;az has written one, but
it is a wretched performance: he did not under&s;tand the fir&s;t prin|ciples
of the &s;cience he undertook to illu&s;trate; and his geometry
&s;hews, that he did not under&s;tand the fir&s;t principles of geometry.
There is a po&s;thumous work of M. Varignon's, called <HI>Eclairci&s;&s;emens
&s;ur l' Analy&s;e des Infiniment petits.</HI> Paris, 1725, 4to. This will be often
of u&s;e to you. However, it mu&s;t be owned, that the notion of the
<HI>Infiniment petits,</HI> or <HI>Infinite&s;imals,</HI> as we call them, is too bold an a&s;|&s;umption,
and too remote from the principles of the ancients, our
ma&s;ters in geometry; and has given a handle to an ingenious author
<PB N="425" REF="446">
(Berkeley, late bi&s;hop of Cloyne) to attack the logic of modern
mathematicians. He has been an&s;wered by many, but by none &s;o
clearly as by Mr. Maclaurin, in his Fluxions, (2 vols. in 4to,) where
you will meet with a collection of the mo&s;t valuable di&s;coveries
in the mathematical and phy&s;ico-mathematical &s;ciences. I recom|mend
this author to you; but whether you ought to read him
immediately after M. de l'Hopital, may be a que&s;tion. I think you
may be &s;atisfied at fir&s;t with reading his introduction, and chap. 1.
book I. of the grounds of the Method of Fluxions, and then pro|ceed
to chap. 12. of the &s;ame book, &sect; 495 to &sect; 505 inclu&s;ive, where
he treats of the Method of Infinite&s;imals, and of the Limits of Ratios.
You may then read chap. 1. book II. &sect; 697 to &sect; 714 inclu&s;ive; and
this you may do immediately after reading the fir&s;t &s;ection of the
<HI>Analy&s;e des Infiniment petits:</HI> or if you plea&s;e, you may po&s;tpone a
critical inquiry into the principles of Infinite&s;imals and Fluxions, till
you have &s;een the u&s;e and application of this doctrine in the drawing
of Tangents, and in finding the Maxima and Minima of Geometrical
Magnitudes. <HI>Annal. des Infin. pet.</HI> &sect; 2 <HI>and</HI> 3.</P>
<P>When you have read the beginning of l'Hopital's 4th &s;ect. to
&s;ect. 65 inclu&s;ive, you may read Maclaurin's chap. 2, 3, and 4;
where he fully explains the nature of the&s;e higher orders of Fluxions,
and applies the notion to geometrical figures. Your principles being
then firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, you may fini&s;h M. de l'Hopital.</P>
<P>Your next &s;tep mu&s;t be to the inver&s;e method of Fluxions, called
by the French <HI>calcul integral.</HI> Mon&s;ieur de Bougainville has given
us a treati&s;e upon this &s;ubject, Paris, 1754, 4to. under the title
<HI>Trait&eacute; du calcul integral pour &s;ervir de &s;uite a l' Analy&s;e des Infiniment
petits.</HI> You &s;hould have it; but though he explains the methods
hitherto found out for the determination of Fluents from given
Fluxions, or in the French &s;tyle, <HI>pour trouver les integrales des dif|ferences
donne&eacute;s;</HI> yet as he has not &s;hewn the u&s;e and application of
this doctrine, as de l'Hopital did, with re&s;pect to that part which he
<PB N="426" REF="447">
treats of, M. de Bougainville's book is, for that rea&s;on, not &s;o well
&s;uited to beginners as could be wi&s;hed. You may therefore take
Carr&eacute;'s book in 4to, printed at Paris, 1700, and entitled, <HI>Methode
pour la Me&s;ure des Surfaces,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>par l' Application du Calcul integral.</HI>
Only I mu&s;t caution you again&s;t depending upon him in his fourth
&s;ection, where he treats of the centre of o&s;cillation and percu&s;&s;ion;
he having made &s;everal mi&s;takes there, as M. de Mairan has &s;hewn,
p. 196. <HI>Mem. de l' Acad. Royale des Sciences,</HI> edit. Paris, 1735. After
Carr&eacute;, you may read Bougainville.</P>
<P>I have recommended French authors to you, becau&s;e you are a
thorough ma&s;ter of that language, and becau&s;e, by their &s;tudying
&s;tyle and clearne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, they &s;eem to me be&s;t adapted to
beginners. Our authors are often profound and acute, but their la|coni&s;ms,
and neglect of expre&s;&s;ion, often perplex beginners. I
except Mr. Maclaurin, who is very clear; but then he has &s;uch a
va&s;t variety of matter, that a great part of his book is, on that ac|count,
too difficult for a beginner. I might recommend other au|thors
to you, as a cour&s;e of elements; for in&s;tance, you might
read Mr. Thomas Simp&s;on's Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry, and
Fluxions; all which contain a great variety of good things. In his
Geometry he departs from Euclid without a &s;ufficient rea&s;on. How|ever,
you may read him after Dr. Robert Sim&s;on's Euclid, or
together with it, and take notice of what is new in Thomas Simp&s;on.
His Algebra you may join with Clairaut; and the rather that Clairaut
has been &s;paring of particular problems, and has, be&s;ides, omitted &s;e|veral
u&s;eful applications of Algebra. Simp&s;on's Fluxions may go hand
in hand with l'Hopital, Maclaurin, Carr&eacute;, and Bougainville. If you
come to have a competent knowledge of the&s;e authors, you will be
far advanced, and you may proceed to the works of Newton, Cotes,
the Bernoulli's, Dr. Moivre, &amp;c. as your inclination and time will
permit. Sir I&s;aac Newton's treati&s;e of the Quadrature of Curves has
been well commented by Mr. Stewart, and is of it&s;elf a good in|&s;titution
<PB N="427" REF="448">
of Fluxions. Sir I&s;aac's Algebra is commented in &s;everal
places by Clairaut, and in more in Maclaurin's Algebra; and New|ton's
famous Principia are explained by the <HI>Minims Jacquirs et le
Seur,</HI> Geneva, 4 vols. 4to. Cotes is explained by Don Walme&s;ley,
in his <HI>Analy&s;e des Me&s;ures,</HI> &amp;c. Paris, 4to. You &s;ee you may find
work enough. But my paper bids me &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf, dear Sir,</P>

<SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, GEO. LEWIS SCOTT.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> But I recollect, a little late, that the books I have men|tioned,
excepting Newton's Principia, and the occa&s;ional problems in
the re&s;t, treat only of the ab&s;tract parts of the Mathematics; and
you are, no doubt, willing to look into the concrete parts, or what is
called Mixed Mathematics, and the Phy&s;ico-mathematical Sciences.
Of the&s;e the principal are, mechanics, optics, and a&s;tronomy. As to
the principles of mechanics, M. d'Alembert has recommended M.
Trabaud's <HI>Principes du Mouvement et de l'Equilibre,</HI> to beginners;
and you cannot do better than to &s;tudy this book. In optics we
have Dr. Smith's Complete Sy&s;tem, 2 vols. 4to. I wi&s;h though, we
had a good in&s;titution, &s;hort and clear; the Doctor's book entering
into too great details for beginners. However, you may con&s;ider his
fir&s;t book, or popular Treati&s;e, as an In&s;titution, and you will from
thence acquire a good deal of knowledge. In a&s;tronomy I recom|mend
M. le Monnier's <HI>In&s;titutions A&s;tronomiques,</HI> in 4to. Paris, 1746.
It is a tran&s;lation from Keil's A&s;tronomical Lectures, but with con|&s;iderable
additions. You &s;hould al&s;o have Ca&s;&s;ini's <HI>Elemens d' A&s;tro|nomie,</HI>
2 vols. 4to. As to the phy&s;ical cau&s;es of the cele&s;tial mo|tions,
after having read Maclaurin's account of Sir I&s;aac Newton's
philo&s;ophical Di&s;coveries, and Dr. Pemberton's View of Sir I&s;aac's
Philo&s;ophy, you may read the great author him&s;elf, with the com|ment.
But if you read Maclaurin's Fluxions throughout, you will
find many points of Sir I&s;aac's philo&s;ophy well explained there.
<PB N="428" REF="449">
They theory of light and colours &s;hould be &s;tudied in Sir I&s;aac him|&s;elf,
in the Engli&s;h edition of his Optics, 8vo. there is a branch
of the optical &s;ciences which I have not mentioned, that is, Per|&s;pective.
Dr. Brook Taylor's is the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem, but his &s;tyle and
expre&s;&s;ion is embarra&s;&s;ed and ob&s;cure. L'Abb&eacute; de la Caille has al&s;o
given a good treati&s;e of Per&s;pective, at the end of his <HI>Optique:</HI> the&s;e
are of u&s;e to painters; but the theory of mathematical projection
in general is more exten&s;ive, and has been well treated of by old
writers, Clavius, Aguillonius, Tacquet, and De Chules: and lately
M. de la Caille has given a memoir among tho&s;e of the <HI>Acad. Roy.
des Sciences</HI> of Paris, <HI>anno</HI> 1741, <HI>&s;ur le calcul des projections en ge|neral.</HI>
This &s;ubject is nece&s;&s;ary for the under&s;tanding of the theory
of maps and plani&s;pheres. Mathematicians have al&s;o applied their
art to the theory of &s;ounds and mu&s;ic. Dr. Smith's Harmonics is
the principal book of the kind.</P>
<P>Thus have I given you &s;ome account of the principal elementary
authors in the different branches of mathematical knowledge, and
it were much to be wi&s;hed that we had a complete in&s;titution, or
cour&s;e, of all the&s;e things of a moderate &s;ize, which might &s;erve as
an introduction to all the good original authors. Wolfius attempted
this; his intention was laudable, but his book is &s;o full of errors of
the pre&s;s, be&s;ides &s;ome of his own, that I cannot recommend him
to a beginner. He might be u&s;ed occa&s;ionally for the &s;ignification
of terms, and for many hi&s;torical facts relating to mathematics;
and, be&s;ides, may be con&s;idered as a collector of problems, which
is u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the books I have mentioned, it might be of u&s;e to you to
have M. Montucla's <HI>Hi&s;toire des Mathematiques,</HI> in 4to. 2. vols. You
will there find a hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s of the mathematical &s;ciences,
and &s;ome account of the principal authors relating to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I mentioned to you in conver&s;ation, the &s;uperior elegance of the
antient method of demon&s;tration. If you incline to examine this
<PB N="429" REF="450">
point, after being well ver&s;ed in Euclid, you may proceed to Dr.
Sim&s;on's Conic Sections; and to form an idea of the antient analy&s;is
or method of inve&s;tigating the &s;olution of geometrical problems, read
Euclid's Data, which Dr. Sim&s;on will publi&s;h, together with his new
edition of Euclid; and then read his <HI>Loci Plani,</HI> in 4to. The elegance
of the method of the ancients is confe&s;&s;ed; but it &s;eems to require the
remembrance of a great multitude of propo&s;itions, and in complicated
problems it does not &s;eem probable that it can be extended &s;o far as
the algebraic method.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>PARIS, <DATE>February the 12th, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU remember our agreement,&mdash;&s;hort and frequent letters. The
fir&s;t part of the treaty you have no doubt of my ob&s;erving. I
think I ought not to leave you any of the &s;econd. <HI>A propos</HI> of
treaty: our definitive one was &s;igned here ye&s;terday, and this morn|ing
the Duke of Bridgewater and Mr. Neville went for London
with the news of it. The plenipotentiaries &s;at up till ten o'clock
in the morning at the amba&s;&s;ador of Spain's ball, and then went to
&s;ign this treaty, which regulates the fate of Europe.</P>
<P>Paris, in mo&s;t re&s;pects, has fully an&s;wered my expectations. I
have a number of very good acquaintance, which increa&s;e every
day; for nothing is &s;o ea&s;y as the making them here. In&s;tead of
complaining of the want of them, I begin already to think of mak|ing
a choice. Next Sunday, for in&s;tance, I have only three invita|tions
to dinner. Either in the hou&s;es you are already acquainted,
<PB N="430" REF="451">
you meet with people who a&s;k you to come and &s;ee them, or &s;ome
of your friends offer them&s;elves to introduce you. When I &s;peak of
the&s;e connections, I mean chiefly for dinner and the evening. Sup|pers,
as yet, I am pretty much a &s;tranger to, and I fancy &s;hall con|tinue
&s;o; for Paris is divided into two &s;pecies, who have but little
communication with each other. The one, who is chiefly con|nected
with the men of letters, dine very much at home, are glad to
&s;ee their friends, and pa&s;s the evenings till about nine, in agreeable
and rational conver&s;ation. The others are the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable, &s;up
in numerous parties, and always play, or rather game, both before
and after &s;upper. You may ea&s;ily gue&s;s which &s;ort &s;uits me be&s;t.
Indeed, Madam, we may &s;ay what we plea&s;e of the frivolity of the
French, but I do a&s;&s;ure you, that in a fortnight pa&s;&s;ed at Paris, I
have heard more conver&s;ation worth remembering, and &s;een more
men of letters among the people of fa&s;hion, than I had done in two
or three winters in London.</P>
<P>Among&s;t my acquaintance I cannot help mentioning M. Helvetius,
the author of the famous book <HI>de l' E&s;prit.</HI> I met him at dinner at
Madame Geoffrin's, where he took great notice of me, made me a
vi&s;it next day, has ever &s;ince treated me, not in a polite but a
friendly manner. Be&s;ides being a &s;en&s;ible man, an agreeable com|panion,
and the worthie&s;t creature in the world, he has a very pretty
wife, an hundred thou&s;and livres a year, and one of the be&s;t tables
in Paris. The only thing I di&s;like in him is his great attachment to,
and admiration for, * * * *, who&s;e character is indeed at Paris
beyond any thing you can conceive. To the great civility of this
foreigner, who was not obliged to take the lea&s;t notice of me, I mu&s;t

<OPENER><DATELINE>PARIS, <DATE>February 24, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your letter about twelve days after its date, owing, as
I apprehend, to Mr. Foley's negligence. My direction is, <HI>&agrave;

Mon&s;ieur Mon&s;ieur</HI> Gibbon, <HI>Gentilhomme Anglois &agrave; l' Hotel de Lon|dres,
rue de Columbier, Fauxbourg St. Germains, &agrave; Paris.</HI> You &s;ee I am
&s;till in that part of the town; and indeed from all the intelligence I
could collect, I &s;aw no rea&s;on to change, either on account of cheap|ne&s;s
or plea&s;antne&s;s. Madame Bontems, Mrs. Mallet's friend, and
a Marquis de Mirabeau, (I got acquainted with at her hou&s;e,) have
acted a very friendly part; though all their endeavours have only
&s;erved to convince me that Paris is unavoidably a very dear place. I
am &s;orry to find my Engli&s;h cloaths look very foreign. The French
are now exce&s;&s;ively long-wai&s;ted. At pre&s;ent we are in mourning
for the Bi&s;hop of Liege, the king's uncle; and expect &s;oon another
of a &s;ingular nature, for the old Pretender, who is very ill. They
mourn for him, not as a crowned head, but as a relation of the
king's. I am doubtful how the Engli&s;h here will behave; indeed
we can have no difficulties, &s;ince we need only follow the example
of the Duke of Bedford.</P>
<P>I have now pa&s;&s;ed nearly a month in this place, and I can &s;ay with
truth, that it has an&s;wered my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. The
buildings of every kind, the libraries, the public diver&s;ions, take up
a great part of my time; and I have already found &s;everal hou&s;es,
where it is both very ea&s;y and very agreeable to be acquainted.
Lady Harvey's recommendation to Madame Geoffrin was a mo&s;t
excellent one. Her hou&s;e is a very good one; regular dinners there
every Wedne&s;day, and the be&s;t company of Paris, in men of letters
and people of fa&s;hion. It was at her hou&s;e I connected my&s;elf with
<PB N="432" REF="453">
M. Helvetius, who, from his heart, his head, and his fortune, is a
mo&s;t valuable man.</P>
<P>At his hou&s;e I was introduced to the Baron d'Olbach, who is a
man of parts and fortune, and has two dinners every week. The
other hou&s;es I am known in, are the Duche&s;s d' Aiguillon's, Madame
la Comte&s;&s;e de Froulay's, Madame du Bocage, Madame Boyer,
M. le Marquis de Mirabeau, and M. de Foucemagn. All the&s;e
people have their different merit; in &s;ome I meet with good din|ners;
in others, &s;ocieties for the evening; and in all, good &s;en&s;e,
entertainment, and civility; which, as I have no favours to a&s;k, or
bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act with them, is &s;ufficient for me. Their men of
letters are as affable and communicative as I expected. My letters
to them did me no harm, but were very little nece&s;&s;ary. My book
had been of great &s;ervice to me, and the compliments I have re|ceived
upon it would make me in&s;ufferably vain, if I laid any &s;tre&s;s
on them. When I take notice of the civilities I have received, I mu&s;t
take notice too of what I have &s;een of a contrary behaviour. You
know how much I always built upon the Count de Caylus: he has
not been of the lea&s;t u&s;e to me. With great difficulty I have &s;een
him, and that is all. I do not, however, attribute his behaviour to
pride, or di&s;like to me, but &s;olely to the man's general character,
which &s;eems to be a very odd one. De la Motte, Mrs. Mallet's
friend, has behaved very drily to me, though I have dined with
him twice. But I can forgive him a great deal, in con&s;ideration of
his having introduced me to M. d'Augny (Mrs. Mallet's &s;on). Her
men are generally angels or devils; but here I really think, without
being very prone to admiration, that &s;he has &s;aid very little too much
of him. As far as I can judge, he has certainly an uncommon degree
of under&s;tanding and knowledge, and, I believe, a great fund of
honour and probity. We are very much together, and I think our
intimacy &s;eems to be growing into a friend&s;hip. Next Sunday we
go to Ver&s;ailles; the king's guard is done by a detachment from
<PB N="433" REF="454">
Paris, which is relieved every four days; and as he goes upon this
command, it is a very good occa&s;ion for me to &s;ee the palace. I
&s;hall not neglect, at the &s;ame time, the opportunity of informing
my&s;elf of the French di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The great news at pre&s;ent is the arrival of a very extraordinary
per&s;on from the I&s;le of France in the Ea&s;t Indies. An ob&s;cure
Frenchman, who was lately come into the i&s;land, being very ill, and
given over, &s;aid, that before he died he mu&s;t di&s;charge his con&s;cience
of a great burden he had upon it, and declared to &s;everal people, he
was the accomplice of Damien, and the very per&s;on who held the
hor&s;es. Unluckily for him, the man recovered after this declaration,
was immediately &s;ent pri&s;oner to Paris, and is ju&s;t landed at Port
l'Orient, from whence he is daily expected here, to unravel the
whole my&s;tery of that dark affair. This &s;tory (which at fir&s;t was
laughed at) has now gained entire credit, and I apprehend mu&s;t be
founded on real fact.</P>
<P>A lady of Mi&s;s Caryll's acquaintance has de&s;ired me to convey the
inclo&s;ed letter to her. You will be &s;o good as to &s;end it over to Lady|holt.

<HEAD>N^o XVII. Mr. GIBBON to Mr. HOLROYD at Lau&s;anne.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BOROMEAN ISLANDS, <DATE>May the 16th, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR HOLROYD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HURRY of running about, time taken up with &s;eeing places, &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c. are excellent excu&s;es; but I fancy you will gue&s;s
that my lazine&s;s and aver&s;ion to writing to my be&s;t friend are the
real motives, and I am afraid you will have gue&s;&s;ed right.</P>
<P>We are at this minute in a mo&s;t magnificent palace, in the middle
of a va&s;t lake; ranging about &s;uites of rooms without a &s;oul to
interrupt us, and &s;ecluded from the re&s;t of the univer&s;e. We &s;hall
&s;it down in a moment to &s;upper, attended by all the Count's hou&s;e|hold.
This is the fine &s;ide of the medal: turn to the rever&s;e. We
are got here wet to the &s;kin; we have crawled about fine gardens
which rain and fogs prevented our &s;eeing; and if to-morrow does
not hold up a little better, we &s;hall be in &s;ome doubt whether we
can &s;ay we have &s;een the&s;e famous i&s;lands. Gui&s;e &s;ays yes, and I
&s;ay no. The Count is not here; we have our &s;upper from a paultry
hedge alehou&s;e, (excu&s;e the bull,) and the &s;ervants have offered us
beds in the palace, pur&s;uant to their ma&s;ter's directions.</P>
<P>I hardly think you will like Turin; the court is old and dull;
and in that country every one follows the example of the court.
The principal amu&s;ement &s;eems to be, driving about in your coach
in the evening, and bowing to the people you meet. If you go
while the Royal Family is there, you have the additional plea&s;ure
of &s;topping to &s;alute them every time they pa&s;s. I had that advan|tage
fifteen times one afternoon. We were pre&s;ented to a lady who
keeps a public a&s;&s;embly, and a very mournful one it is; the few
women that go to it are each taken up by their cici&s;beo; and a poor
Engli&s;hman, who can neither talk Piedmontois nor play at Faro,
<PB N="435" REF="456">
&s;tands by him&s;elf without one of their haughty nobility doing him
the honour of &s;peaking to him. You mu&s;t not attribute this account
to our not having &s;taid long enough to form connections. It is a
general complaint of our countrymen, except of Lord ***, who
has been engaged for about two years in the &s;ervice of a lady,
who&s;e long no&s;e is her mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing fine feature. The mo&s;t
&s;ociable women I have met with are the king's daughters. I chatted
for about a quarter of an hour with them, talked about Lau&s;anne,
and grew &s;o very free and ea&s;y, that I drew my &s;nuff-box, rapped
it, took &s;nuff twice (a crime never known before in the pre&s;ence
chamber), and continued my di&s;cour&s;e in my u&s;ual attitude of my
body bent forwards, and my fore &s;inger &s;tretched out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This attitude continued to be characteri&s;tic of Mr. Gibbon. The engraving in
the fronti&s;piece of the Memoirs is taken from the figure of Mr. Gibbon cut with
&s;ci&s;&s;ars by Mrs. Brown thirty years after the date of this letter. The extraordinary
talents of this lady have furni&s;hed as complete a likene&s;s of Mr. Gibbon, as to per&s;on,
face, and manner, as can be conceived; yet it was done in his ab&s;ence.</NOTE>. As it might
however have been difficult to keep up this acquaintance, I chiefly
employ my time in &s;eeing places, which fully repaid me in plea&s;ure
the trouble of my journey. What entertained me the mo&s;t, was the
mu&s;eum and the citadel. The fir&s;t is under the care of a M. Bartoli,
who received us, without any introduction, in the polite&s;t manner
in the world, and was of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to us, as I dare &s;ay he
will be to you. The citadel is a &s;tupendous work; and when you
have &s;een the &s;ubterraneous part of it, you will &s;carcely think it po&s;|&s;ible
&s;uch a place can ever be taken. As it is however a regular one,
it does not pique my curio&s;ity &s;o much as tho&s;e irregular fortifica|tions
hewn out of the Alps, as Exiles, Fene&s;trelles, and the Brunette
would have done, could we have &s;pared the time nece&s;&s;ary. Our
next &s;tage from Turin has been Milan, where we were mere &s;pecta|tors,
as it was not worth while to endeavour at forming connections
for &s;o very few days. I think you will be &s;urpri&s;ed at the great
church, but infinitely more &s;o at the regiment of Baden, which is in
the citadel. Such &s;teadine&s;s, &s;uch alertne&s;s in the men, and &s;uch
<PB N="436" REF="457">
exactne&s;s in the officers, as exceeded all my expectations. Next Friday
I &s;hall &s;ee the regiment reviewed by General Serbelloni. Perhaps
I may write a particular letter about it. From Milan we proceed
to Genoa, and thence to Florence. you &s;tare&mdash;But really we find
it &s;o inconvenient to travel like mutes, and to lo&s;e a number of
curious things for want of being able to a&s;&s;i&s;t our eyes with our

for next year. I think I &s;hould advi&s;e you to do the &s;ame.</P>

<P>THE next morning was not fair, but however we were able to
take a view of the i&s;lands, which, by the help of &s;ome imagination,
we conclude to be a very delightful, though not an enchanted place.
I would certainly advi&s;e you to go there from Milan, which you
may very well perform in a day and half. Upon our return, we
found Lord Tilney and &s;ome other Engli&s;h in their way to Venice.
We heard a melancholy piece of news from them: Byng died at
Bologna a few days ago of a fever. I am &s;ure you will be all very

and in particular to the alliance of the Duche&s;s with the Frog. Is it
already concluded? How does the bride look after her great revo|lution?

health, not forgetting the little woman on the top of Mount Cenis, in
the middle of the Lago Maggiore, &amp;c. &amp;c. I expect &s;ome account

<HEAD>N^o XVIII. Mr. GIBBON to Mr. HOLROYD at Berlin.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BERITON, <DATE>October 31&s;t, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR HOLROYD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHY did I not leave a letter for you at Mar&s;eilles? For a very
plain rea&s;on: becau&s;e I did not go to Mar&s;eilles. But, as you
have mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly added, why did not I &s;end one? Humph. I
own that nonplu&s;&s;es me a little. However, hearken to my hi&s;tory.
After revolving a variety of plans, and &s;uiting them as well as
po&s;&s;ible to time and finances, Gui&s;e and I at la&s;t agreed to pa&s;s from
Venice to Lyons, &s;wim down the Rhone, wheel round the &s;outh of
France, and embark at Bourdeaux. Alas! At Lyons I received
letters which convinced me that I ought no longer to deprive my
country of one of her greate&s;t ornaments. Unwillingly I obeyed,
left Gui&s;e to execute alone the remainder of our plan, pa&s;&s;ed about
ten delicious days at Paris, and arrived in England about the end of
June. Gui&s;e followed me about two months afterwards, as I was
informed by an epi&s;tle from him, which, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment,
I immediately an&s;wered. You perceive there is &s;till &s;ome virtue
among&s;t men. <HI>Exempli grati&acirc;,</HI> your letter is dated Vienna, October
12th, 1765; it made its appearance at Beriton, Wedne&s;day evening,
October the 29th. I am at this pre&s;ent writing, &s;itting in my library,
on Thur&s;day morning, between the hours of twelve and one. I
have ventured to &s;uppo&s;e you &s;till at Berlin; if not, I pre&s;ume you
take care that your letters &s;hould follow you. This ideal march to
Berlin is the only one I can make at pre&s;ent. I am under command;
and were I to talk of a third fally as yet, I know &s;ome certain people
who would think it ju&s;t as ridiculous as the third &s;ally of the re|nowned
Don Quixote. All I ever hoped for was, to be able to take
<PB N="438" REF="459">
the field once more, after lying quiet a couple of years. I mu&s;t
own that your executing your tour in &s;o complete a manner gives
me a little &s;elfi&s;h. If I make a &s;ummer's e&s;cape to Berlin, I
cannot hope for the companion I flattered my&s;elf with. I am &s;orry
however I have &s;aid &s;o much; but as it is difficult to encrea&s;e your
Honour's proper notions of your own perfections, I will e'en let it
&s;tand. Indeed I owed you &s;omething for your account of the fa|vourable
reception my book has met with. I &s;ee there are people of
ta&s;te at Vienna, and no longer wonder at your liking it. Since the
court is &s;o agreeable, a thorough reformation mu&s;t have taken place.
The &s;tiffne&s;s of the Au&s;trian etiquette, and the haughty magnificence
of the Hungarian princes, mu&s;t have given way to more civilized
notions. You have (no doubt) informed your&s;elf of the forces and
revenues of the empre&s;s. I think (however unfa&s;hionably) we
always e&s;teemed her. Have you lo&s;t or improved that opinion.
Princes, like pictures to be admired, mu&s;t be &s;een in their proper
point of view, which is often a pretty di&s;tant one. I am afraid you
will find it peculiarly &s;o at Berlin.</P>
<P>I need not de&s;ire you to pay a mo&s;t minute attention to the Au&s;trian
and Pru&s;&s;ian di&s;cipline. You have been bit by a mad &s;erjeant as well
as my&s;elf; and when we meet, we &s;hall run over every particular
which we can approve, blame, or imitate. Since my arrival, I
have a&s;&s;umed the augu&s;t character of Major, received returns, i&s;&s;ued
orders, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I do not intend you &s;hall have the honour of
reviewing my troops next &s;ummer. Three fourths of the men will
be recruits; and during my pilgrimage, di&s;cipline &s;eems to have been
relaxed. But I &s;ummon you to fulfil another engagement. Make
me a vi&s;it next &s;ummer. You will find here a bad hou&s;e, a plea&s;ant
country in &s;ummer, &s;ome books, and very little <HI>&s;trange</HI> company.
Such a plan of life for two or three months mu&s;t, I &s;hould imagine,
&s;uit a man who has been for as many years &s;truck from one end of
Europe to the other like a tennis-ball. At lea&s;t I judge of you by
<PB N="439" REF="460">
my&s;elf. I always loved a quiet, &s;tudious, indolent life; but never
enjoyed the charms of it &s;o truly, as &s;ince my return from an agree|able
but fatiguing cour&s;e of motion and hurry. However I &s;hall
hear of your arrival, which can &s;carcely be &s;o &s;oon as January 1766,
and &s;hall probably have the misfortune of meeting you in town &s;oon
after. We may then &s;ettle any plans for the en&s;uing campaign.</P>
<P><HI>En attendant,</HI> (admire me, this is the only &s;crap of foreign lingo I
have imported into this epi&s;tle&mdash;if you had &s;een that of Gui&s;e to
me!) let me tell you a piece of Lau&s;anne news. Nanette Grand is
married to Lieutenant-colonel Prevot. Grand wrote to me; and by
the next po&s;t I congratulated both father and daughter. There is
exactne&s;s for you. The Curchod (Madame Necker) I &s;aw at Paris.
She was very fond of me, and the hu&s;band particularly civil. Could
they in&s;ult me more cruelly? A&s;k me every evening to &s;upper; go
to bed, and leave me alone with his wife&mdash;what an impertinent &s;ecu|rity!
it is making an old lover of mighty little con&s;equence. She is
as hand&s;ome as ever, and much genteeler; &s;eems plea&s;ed with her
fortune rather than proud of it. I was (perhaps indi&s;creetly enough)
exalting Nanette d'Illens's good luck and the fortune. What fortune?
(&s;aid &s;he, with an air of contempt)&mdash;not above twenty thou&s;and
livres a-year. I &s;miled, and &s;he caught her&s;elf immediately.&mdash;
<Q>What airs I give my&s;elf in de&s;pi&s;ing twenty thou&s;and livres a-year,
who a year ago looked upon eight hundred as the &s;ummit of my
wi&s;hes.</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t end this tedious &s;crawl. Let me hear from you: I think
I de&s;erve it. Believe me, Dear Holroyd, I &s;hare in all your plea&s;ures,
and feel all your misfortunes. Poor Bolton! I &s;aw it in the new&s;|paper.
Is Ridley with you? I &s;u&s;pect not: but if he is, a&s;&s;ure him
I do not forget him though he does me. Adieu; and believe me,
mo&s;t affectionately yours,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>BERITON, <DATE>April 29, 1767.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR HOLROYD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAPPENED to-night to &s;tumble upon a very odd piece of intel|ligence
in the St. James's Chronicle; it related to the marriage
of a certain Mon&s;ieur Olroy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name was &s;o &s;pelt in the new&s;papers.</NOTE>, formerly Captain of Hu&s;&s;ars. I do
not know how it came into my head that this Captain of Hu&s;&s;ars
was not unknown to me, and that he might po&s;&s;ibly be an acquaint|ance
of yours. If I am not mi&s;taken in my conjecture, pray give
my compliments to him, and tell him from me, that I am at lea&s;t as
well plea&s;ed that he is married as if I were &s;o my&s;elf. A&s;&s;ure him,
however, that though as a philo&s;opher I may prefer celibacy, yet as
a politician I think it highly proper that the &s;pecies &s;hould be propa|gated
by the u&s;ual method; a&s;&s;ure him even that I am convinced,
that if celibacy is expo&s;ed to fewer mi&s;eries, marriage can alone pro|mi&s;e
real happine&s;s, &s;ince dome&s;tic enjoyments are the &s;ource of
every other good. May &s;uch happine&s;s, which is be&s;towed on few,
be given to him; the tran&s;ient ble&s;&s;ings of beauty, and the more
durable ones of fortune, good &s;en&s;e, and an amiable di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I can ea&s;ily conceive, and as ea&s;ily excu&s;e you, if you have
thought mighty little this winter of your poor ru&s;ticated friend. I
have been confined ever &s;ince Chri&s;tmas, and confined by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of very melancholy occupations. I had &s;carcely arrived at Beriton,
where I propo&s;ed &s;taying only about a fortnight, when a brother of
Mrs. Gibbon's died unexpectedly, though after a very long and painful
illne&s;s. We were &s;carcely recovered from the confu&s;ion which &s;uch
an event mu&s;t produce in a family, when my father was taken dan|gerou&s;ly
<PB N="441" REF="462">
ill, and with &s;ome intervals has continued &s;o ever &s;ince.
I can a&s;&s;ure you, my dear Holroyd, that the &s;ame event appears in
a very different light when the danger is &s;erious and immediate; or
when, in the gaiety of a tavern dinner, we affect an in&s;en&s;ibility that
would do us no great honour were it real. My father is now much
better; but I have &s;ince been a&s;&s;ailed by a &s;evere &s;troke&mdash;the lo&s;s of
a friend. You remember, perhaps, an officer of our militia, whom
I &s;ometimes u&s;ed to compare to your&s;elf. Indeed, the compari&s;on
would have done honour to any one. His feelings were tender and
noble, and he was always guided by them: his principles were ju&s;t
and generous, and he acted up to them. I &s;hall &s;ay no more, and
you will excu&s;e my having &s;aid &s;o much, of a man with whom you
were unacquainted; but my mind is ju&s;t now &s;o very full of him,
that I cannot ea&s;ily talk, or even think, of any thing el&s;e. If I know
you right, you will not be offended at my <HI>weakne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>What rather adds to my unea&s;ine&s;s, is the nece&s;&s;ity I am under of
joining our militia the day after to-morrow. Though the lively
hurry of &s;uch a &s;cene might contribute to divert my ideas, yet
every circum&s;tance of it, and the place it&s;elf, (which was that of his
re&s;idence,) will give me many a painful moment. I know nothing
would better rai&s;e my &s;pirits than a vi&s;it from you; the reque&s;t may
appear un&s;ea&s;onable, but I think I have heard you &s;peak of <HI>an uncle</HI>
you had near Southampton. At all events, I hope you will &s;natch a
moment to write to me, and give me &s;ome account of your pre&s;ent
&s;ituation and future de&s;igns. As you are now fettered, I &s;hould ex|pect
you will not be &s;uch a <HI>hic et ubique</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The motto of the regiment called Royal Fore&s;ters, in which Mr. Holroyd had

<P>There are two county conte&s;ts, Sir Thomas Egerton and Colonel
Townley in Lanca&s;hire, after the county had for &s;ome time gone

<P>HOWEVER, notwith&s;tanding my indignation, I will employ five
minutes in telling you two or three recent pieces of news.</P>
<P>1. Charles Fox is commenced patriot, and is already attempting to
pronounce the words <HI>country, liberty, corruption,</HI> &amp;c.; with what &s;uc|ce&s;s,
<PB N="450" REF="471">
time will di&s;cover. Ye&s;terday he re&s;igned the Admiralty. The
&s;tory is, that he could not prevail on mini&s;try to join with him in
his intended repeal of the marriage act, (a favourite mea&s;ure of his
father, who oppo&s;ed it from its origin,) and that Charles very judi|ciou&s;ly
thought Lord Holland's friend&s;hip imported him more than
Lord North's.</P>
<P>2. Ye&s;terday the marriage me&s;&s;age came to both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment.
You will &s;ee the words of it in the papers: and, thanks to
the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive piety of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, it is hoped that *.</P>
<P>3. To-day the Hou&s;e of Commons was employed in a very odd
way. Tommy Town&s;hend moved, that the &s;ermon of Dr. Knowell,
who preached before the Hou&s;e on the 30th of January, (<HI>id e&s;t,</HI>
before the Speaker and four members,) &s;hould be burnt by the
common hangman, as containing arbitrary, tory, high-flown doc|trines.
The Hou&s;e was nearly agreeing to the motion, till they re|collected
that they had already thanked the Preacher for his excellent
di&s;cour&s;e, and ordered it to be printed. Knowell's book&s;eller is much
obliged to the Right Honourable Tommy Town&s;hend.</P>

<P>YOUR very elegant letter on the antiquity and authenticity of the
book of Daniel, (ju&s;t now received,) finds me here, if not without
lei&s;ure, yet without books, and therefore in no condition to enter far
into the depths of this controver&s;y; which indeed is the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary,
as every thing that relates to the &s;ubject will come of cour&s;e to be
con&s;idered by my learned &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the new lecture. For as the
prophecies of Daniel make an important link in <HI>that chain, which,</HI> as
you &s;ay, <HI>has been let down from heaven to earth,</HI> (but not by the
author of the late &s;ermons, who brought into view only what he
had not invented,) the grounds on which their authority re&s;ts will,
without doubt, be carefully examined, and, as I &s;uppo&s;e, firmly
e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But in the mean time, and to make at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;mall return for
the civility of your addre&s;s to me, I beg leave to trouble you with
two or three &s;hort remarks, &s;uch as occur to me on reading your
letter.</P>
<P>Your main difficulties are the&s;e two: 1. That the author of the
book of Daniel is too clear for a prophet; as appears from his pre|diction
of the Per&s;ian and Macedonian affairs: and, 2. too fabulous
for a contemporary hi&s;torian; as is evident, you &s;uppo&s;e, from his
mi&s;takes, particularly in the &s;ixth chapter.</P>
<P>1. The fir&s;t of the&s;e difficulties is an extraordinary one. For
why may not prophecy, if the in&s;pirer think fit, be as clear as
hi&s;tory? Scriptural prophecy, whence your idea of its ob&s;curity is
<PB N="456" REF="477">
taken, is <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> thus clear, I mean after the event; and Daniel's
prophecy of the revolutions in the Grecian empire, would have been
ob&s;cure enough to Porphyry him&s;elf before it.</P>
<P>But your opinion, after all, when you come to explain your&s;elf,
really is, as one &s;hould expect, that, as a prophet, Daniel is not
clear enough; for you enforce the old objection of Porphyry, by
ob&s;erving, that where a pretended prophecy is clear to a certain
point of time, and afterwards ob&s;cure and &s;hadowy, there common
&s;en&s;e leads one to conclude that the author of it was an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning is plau&s;ible, but not conclu&s;ive, unle&s;s it be taken for
granted, that a prophecy mu&s;t, in all its parts, be equally clear and
preci&s;e: whereas, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of real in&s;piration, it may be
fit, I mean it may &s;uit with the views of the in&s;pirer, to predict &s;ome
things with more per&s;picuity, and in terms more obviou&s;ly and
directly applicable to the events in which they were fulfilled, than
others. But further, this rea&s;oning, whatever force it may have,
has no place here; at lea&s;t you evidently beg the que&s;tion when
you urge it; becau&s;e the per&s;ons you di&s;pute again&s;t maintain, that
the &s;ub&s;equent prophecies of Daniel are equally di&s;tinct with tho&s;e
preceding ones concerning the Per&s;ian and Macedonian empires, at
lea&s;t &s;o much of them as they take to have been fulfilled; and that
to judge of the re&s;t, we mu&s;t wait for the conclu&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>However, you admit that the &s;u&s;picion ari&s;ing from the cleare&s;t
prophecy may be removed by direct po&s;itive evidence that it was
compo&s;ed before the event. But then you carry your notions of
that evidence very far, when you require, <Q>that the exi&s;tence of
&s;uch a prophecy, prior to its accompli&s;hment, &s;hould be proved
by the knowledge of its being generally diffu&s;ed among&s;t an en|lightened
nation previous to that period, and its public exi&s;tence
atte&s;ted by an unbroken chain of authentic writers.</Q></P>
<P>What you here claim as a matter of <HI>right,</HI> is, without que&s;tion, very
de&s;irable, but &s;hould, I think, be accepted, if it be given at all, as a
<PB N="457" REF="478">
matter of <HI>favour.</HI> For what you de&s;cribe is the utmo&s;t evidence that
the ca&s;e admits: but what right have we in this, or any other &s;ub|ject
whatever of natural or revealed religion, to the utmo&s;t evidence?
Is it not enough that the evidence be &s;ufficient to induce a rea&s;onable
a&s;&s;ent? and is not that a&s;&s;ent rea&s;onable, which is given to real
evidence, though of an inferior kind, when uncontrolled by any
greater? And &s;uch evidence we clearly have for the authenticity of
the book of Daniel, in the reception of it by the Jewi&s;h nation down
to the time of Je&s;us, who&s;e appeal to it &s;uppo&s;es and implies that
reception to have been con&s;tant and general: not to ob&s;erve, that
the te&s;timony of Je&s;us is further &s;upported by all the con&s;iderations
that are alleged for his own divine character. To this evidence,
which is po&s;itive &s;o far as it goes, you have nothing to oppo&s;e but
&s;urmi&s;e and conjectures; that is, nothing that de&s;erves to be called
evidence. But I doubt, Sir, you take for granted that the claim of
in&s;piration is never to be allowed, &s;o long as there is a po&s;&s;ibility of
&s;uppo&s;ing that it was not given.</P>
<P>II. In the &s;econd divi&s;ion of your letter, which is longer, and
more elaborate, than the fir&s;t, you endeavour to &s;hew that the <HI>hi&s;|torical</HI>
part of the book of Daniel, chiefly that of the &s;ixth chapter,
is fal&s;e and fabulous, and as &s;uch, confutes and overthrows the <HI>pro|phetical.</HI>
What you advance on this head, is contained under <HI>five</HI>
articles:</P>
<P>1. You think it &s;trange that Daniel, or any other man, &s;hould be
promoted to a &s;ecret office of &s;tate, <HI>for his &s;kill in divination.</HI></P>
<P>But here, fir&s;t, you forget that Jo&s;eph was thus promoted for the
&s;ame rea&s;on. Or, if you object to this in&s;tance, what &s;hould hinder
the promotion either of Jo&s;eph or Daniel, (when their &s;kill in divina|tion
had once brought them to the notice and favour of their &s;ove|reign,)
for what you call <HI>mere human accompli&s;hments?</HI> For &s;uch
<PB N="458" REF="479">
a&s;&s;uredly both the&s;e great men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, if we may believe the plain
part of their &s;tory, which a&s;&s;erts of Jo&s;eph, and indeed proves, that
he was in no common degree <HI>di&s;creet and wi&s;e;</HI> and of Daniel,
that <HI>an excellent &s;pirit was found in him;</HI> nay, that <HI>he had knowledge
and &s;kill in all learning and wi&s;dom,</HI> over and above his <HI>under&s;tanding
in all vi&s;ions and dreams.</HI> In &s;hort, Sir, though princes of old might
not make it a rule to chu&s;e their mini&s;ters out of their &s;ooth&s;ayers,
yet neither would their being &s;ooth&s;ayers, if they were otherwi&s;e
well accompli&s;hed, prevent them from being mini&s;ters. Ju&s;t as in
modern times, though churchmen have not often, I will &s;uppo&s;e,
been made officers of &s;tate, even by bigotten princes, becau&s;e they
were churchmen; yet neither have they been always excluded from
&s;erving in tho&s;e &s;tations when they have been found eminently qua|lified
for them.</P>
<P>2. Your next exception is, that a combination could &s;carce have
been formed in the court of Babylon again&s;t the favourite mini&s;ter,
(though &s;uch factions are common in other courts,) becau&s;e the
courtiers of Darius <HI>mu&s;t have apprehended that the piety of Daniel
would be a&s;&s;erted by a miraculous interpo&s;ition;</HI> of which they had
&s;een a recent in&s;tance. And here, Sir, you expatiate with a little
too much complacency on the &s;trange indifference which the ancient
world &s;hewed to the gift of miracles. You do not, I dare &s;ay, ex|pect
a &s;erious an&s;wer to this charge; or if you do, it may be enough
to ob&s;erve, what I am &s;ure your own reading and experience mu&s;t
have rendered very familiar to you, that the &s;tronge&s;t belief, or con|viction
of the mind, perpetually gives way to the inflamed &s;elfi&s;h
pa&s;&s;ions; and that, when men have any &s;cheme of intere&s;t or re|venge
much at heart, they are not re&s;trained from pur&s;uing it, though
the &s;caffold and the axe &s;tand before them in full view, and have
perhaps been &s;treaming but the day before with the blood of other
&s;tate-criminals. I a&s;k not, whether miracles have ever <HI>actually</HI>
<PB N="459" REF="480">
exi&s;ted, but whether you do not think that multitudes have been
firmly <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> of their exi&s;tence; and yet their indifference about
them, is a fact which I readily concede to you.</P>
<P>3. Your third critici&s;m is directed again&s;t what is &s;aid of <HI>the law
of the Medes and Per&s;ians, that it altereth not;</HI> where I find nothing to
admire, but the extreme rigour of A&s;iatic de&s;poti&s;m. For I con|&s;ider
this irrevocability of the law, when once promulgated by the
&s;overeign, not as contrived to be a check on his will, but rather to
&s;hew the irre&s;i&s;tible and fatal cour&s;e of it. And this idea was &s;o
much cheri&s;hed by the de&s;pots of Per&s;ia, that, rather than revoke
the iniquitous law, obtained by &s;urprize, for exterminating the Jews,
Aha&s;uerus took the part, as we read in the book of E&s;ther, (and as
Baron Monte&s;quieu, I remember, ob&s;erves,) to permit the Jews to
defend them&s;elves again&s;t the execution of it; whence we &s;ee how
con&s;i&s;tent this law is with the determination of the judges, quoted
by you from Herodotus, <Q>that it was lawful for the king to do
whatever he <HI>plea&s;ed:</HI></Q> for we under&s;tand that he did <HI>not</HI> plea&s;e that
this law, when once declared by him, &s;hould be altered.</P>
<P>You add under this head, <Q>May I not a&s;&s;ert that the Greek
writers, who have &s;o copiou&s;ly treated of the affairs of Per&s;ia,
have not left us the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of a re&s;traint, equally inju|rious
to the monarch and prejudicial to the people.</Q> I have not
the Greek writers by me to con&s;ult, but a common book I chance
to have at hand refers me to one &s;uch ve&s;tige, in a very eminent
Greek hi&s;torian, Diodorus Siculus. <HI>Lowth's Comment. in loc.</HI></P>
<P>4. A fourth objection to the hi&s;toric truth of the book of Daniel is
taken, with more plau&s;ibility, from the matter of this law, which, as
you truly ob&s;erve, was very &s;trange for the king's coun&s;ellor to ad|vi&s;e,
and for any de&s;pot whatever to enact.</P>
<P>But, 1. I a little que&s;tion whether prayer was &s;o con&s;tant and
con&s;iderable a part of Pagan wor&s;hip as is &s;uppo&s;ed; and if it was
not, the prejudices of the people would not be &s;o much &s;hocked by
<PB N="460" REF="481">
this interdict as we are ready to think. Daniel indeed prayed three
times a day; but the idolaters might content them&s;elves with pray|ing
now and then at a &s;tated &s;olemnity. It is clear, that when you
&s;peak of <HI>depriving men of the comforts, and prie&s;ts of the profits, of
religion,</HI> you have Chri&s;tian, and even modern principles and man|ners
in your eye: perhaps in the <HI>comforts,</HI> you repre&s;ented to your|&s;elf
a company of poor inflamed Huguenots under per&s;ecution; and
in the <HI>profits,</HI> the lucrative trade of popi&s;h ma&s;&s;es. But be this as
it may, it &s;hould be con&s;idered, 2. That this law could not, in the
nature of the thing, &s;uppre&s;s all prayer, if the people had any great
propen&s;ity to it. It could not &s;uppre&s;s <HI>mental</HI> prayer; it could not
even &s;uppre&s;s <HI>bodily</HI> wor&s;hip, if performed, as it ea&s;ily might be, in
the night, or in &s;ecret. Daniel, it was well known, was u&s;ed to
pray in open day-light, and in a place expo&s;ed to in&s;pection, from
his u&s;ual manner of praying; which manner, it was ea&s;ily concluded,
&s;o zealous a votary as he was, would not change or di&s;continue, on
account of the edict. La&s;tly, though the edict pa&s;&s;ed for thirty
days, to make &s;ure work, yet there was no doubt but the end pro|po&s;ed
would be &s;oon accompli&s;hed, and then it was not likely that
much care would be taken about the ob&s;ervance of it.</P>
<P>All this put together, I can very well conceive that extreme envy
and malice in the courtiers might &s;ugge&s;t the idea of &s;uch a law, and
that an impotent de&s;pot might be flattered by it. Certainly, if what
we read in the third chapter be admitted, that <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e de&s;pots re|quired
all people, nations, and languages, to wor&s;hip his image on
pain of death, there is no great wonder that <HI>another</HI> of them &s;hould
demand the exclu&s;ive wor&s;hip of him&s;elf for a month; nay, per|haps,
he might think him&s;elf civil, and even bounteous to his gods,
when he left them a &s;hare of the other eleven. For as to the pre|&s;umption,
<Q><L>"Nihil e&s;t quod credere de &s;e</L>
<L>Non po&s;&s;it, cum laudatur diis aequa pote&s;tas.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="482">
5. A fifth, and what you &s;eem to think the &s;tronge&s;t, objection
to the credit of the book of Daniel is, that <Q>no &s;uch per&s;on as
Darius the Mede is to be found in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Babyloni&s;h
princes,</Q> (you mean as given in Ptolemy's canon and the Greek
writers,) <Q>between the time of Nebuchadnezzar and that of Cyrus.</Q>
In &s;aying this, you do not forget or di&s;own what our able&s;t chrono|logers
have &s;aid on the &s;ubject; but then you object that Xenophon's
Cyaxares (to &s;erve a turn) has been made to per&s;onate Darius the
Mede; and yet that Xenophon's book, whether it be a romance or
a true hi&s;tory, overturns the u&s;e which they have made of this
hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>I permit my&s;elf perhaps to be too much flattered by your civility
in referring me to my own ta&s;te, rather than to the authority of
Cicero: but the truth is, I am much di&s;po&s;ed to agree with you,
that, <Q>if we unravel with any care the &s;ine texture of the Cyro|poedia,
we &s;hall di&s;cover in every thread the Spartan di&s;cipline
and the philo&s;ophy of Socrates.</Q> But then, as the judicious
author cho&s;e to make &s;o recent a &s;tory as that of Cyrus, and one &s;o well
known, the vehicle of his political and moral in&s;tructions, he would
be &s;ure to keep up to the truth of the &s;tory as far as might be; e&s;pe|cially
in the leading facts, and in the principal per&s;ons, as we may
&s;ay, of the drama. This obvious rule of decorum &s;uch a writer as
Xenophon could not fail to ob&s;erve; and therefore, on the &s;uppo&s;i|tion
that his Cyropoedia is a romance, I &s;hould conclude certainly
that the outline of it was genuine hi&s;tory. But,</P>
<P>2. If it be &s;o, you conclude that there is no ground for thinking
that Darius the Mede ever reigned at Babylon, becau&s;e Cyaxares
him&s;elf never reigned there.</P>
<P>Now, on the idea of Xenophon's book being a romance, there
might be good rea&s;on for the author's taking no notice of the &s;hort
reign of Cyaxares, which would break the unity of his work, and
divert the reader's attention too much from the hero of it: while yet
<PB N="462" REF="483">
the omi&s;&s;ion could hardly &s;eem to violate hi&s;toric truth, &s;ince the
lu&s;tre of his hero's fame, and the real power, which, out of que&s;tion,
he re&s;erved to him&s;elf, would make us forget or overlook Cyaxares.
But, as to the fact, it &s;eems no way incredible that Cyrus &s;hould
concede to his royal ally, his uncle, and his father-in-law, (for he
was all the&s;e,) the <HI>nominal</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;overeignty; or that he
&s;hould <HI>&s;hare</HI> the &s;overeignty with him; or, at lea&s;t, that he &s;hould
leave the <HI>admini&s;tration,</HI> as we &s;ay, in his hands at Babylon, while
he him&s;elf was pro&s;ecuting his other conque&s;ts at a di&s;tance. Any
of the&s;e things is &s;uppo&s;able enough; and I would rather admit any
of them than reject the expre&s;s, the repeated, the circum&s;tantial
te&s;timony of a not confe&s;&s;edly fabulous hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>After all, Sir, I &s;hould forfeit, I know, your good opinion, if I
did not acknowledge that &s;ome, at lea&s;t, of the&s;e circum&s;tances are
&s;uch as one &s;hould not, perhaps, expect at fir&s;t &s;ight. But then &s;uch
is the condition of things here; and what is true in human life, is
not always, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, not often, that which was previou&s;ly
to be expected; whence an ordinary romance is, they &s;ay, more
<HI>probable</HI> than the be&s;t hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>But &s;hould any or all of the&s;e circum&s;tances convince you per|fectly,
that &s;ome degree of error or fiction is to be found in the book
of Daniel, it would be too precipitate to conclude that therefore the
whole book was of no authority: for, at mo&s;t, you could but infer,
that the hi&s;torical part, in which tho&s;e circum&s;tances are ob&s;erved,
namely, the 6th chapter, is not genuine; ju&s;t as you know has been
judged of &s;ome other hi&s;torical tracts which had formerly been in|&s;erted
in the book of Daniel. For it is not with the&s;e collections,
which go under the names of the Prophets, as with &s;ome regularly
connected &s;y&s;tem, where a charge of fal&s;ehood, if made good again&s;t
one part, &s;hakes the credit of the whole. Fictitious hi&s;tories may
have been joined to true prophecies, when all that bore the name of
the &s;ame per&s;on, or any way related to him, came to be put together
<PB N="463" REF="484">
in the &s;ame volume: but the detection of &s;uch mi&s;alliance could
not affect the prophecies; certainly not tho&s;e of Daniel, which
re&s;pect <HI>the latter times;</HI> for the&s;e have an intrin&s;ic evidence in them|&s;elves,
and a&s;&s;ert their own authenticity, in proportion as we &s;ee, or
have rea&s;on to admit the accompli&s;hment of them.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I have only to commit the&s;e ha&s;ty reflections to
your candour; a virtue which cannot be &s;eparated from the love of
truth, and of which I ob&s;erve many traces in your agreeable letter;
and if you &s;hould indulge this quality &s;till further, &s;o as to conceive
the po&s;&s;ibility of that being <HI>true and rea&s;onable,</HI> in matters of religion,
which may &s;eem &s;trange, or, to &s;o lively a fancy as yours, even ridi|culous,
you would not hurt the credit of your excellent under&s;tand|ing,
and would thus remove one, perhaps a principal, occa&s;ion of
tho&s;e mi&s;ts which, as you complain, <HI>hang over the&s;e nice and difficult
&s;ubjects.</HI></P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<HEAD>The following Fragment was found with the foregoing Letter, in
Mr. GIBBON's handwriting.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR an&s;wers to my five objections again&s;t the 6th chapter of
Daniel come next to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>1. With regard to Daniel's promotion, I con&s;ent to withdraw my
oppo&s;ition, and to allow the ea&s;es of Ximenes, Wol&s;ey, and Richlieu
as parallel in&s;tances; though there is &s;urely &s;ome difference between
a young foreign &s;ooth&s;ayer being <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> rewarded, for the inter|pretation
of a dream, with the government of Babylon, and a prie&s;t
of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, ri&s;ing gradually to the great offices of
&s;tate.</P>
<P>2. You apprehend, Sir, that my &s;econd objection &s;carcely de&s;erves
a &s;erious an&s;wer; and that it is quite &s;ufficient to appeal to my own
reading and experience, whether <HI>the &s;tronge&s;t conviction of the mind
<PB N="464" REF="485">
does not perpetually give way to the inflamed and &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Since
you appeal to me, I &s;hall fairly lay before you the re&s;ult of my ob|&s;ervations
on that &s;ubject. 1. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the drunkard
often &s;inks into the grave, and the prodigal into a gaol, without a
po&s;&s;ibility of deceiving or of checking them&s;elves. But they &s;ink by
&s;low degrees; and, whil&s;t they indulge the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, attend
only to the trifling moment of each guinea, or of each bottle, with|out
calculating their accumulated weight, till they feel them&s;elves
irretrievably cru&s;hed under it. 2. In mo&s;t of the hazardous inter|prizes
of life there is a mixture of chance and good fortune; what is
called good fortune, is often the effect of &s;kill: and as our vanity
flatters us into an opinion of our &s;uperior merit, we are neither &s;ur|pri&s;ed
nor di&s;mayed by the mi&s;carriage of our ra&s;h predece&s;&s;ors.
<HI>The con&s;pirator turns his eyes from the axe and &s;caffold, perhaps &s;till
&s;treaming with blood,</HI> to the &s;ucce&s;sful boldne&s;s of Sylla, of Cae&s;ar,
and of Cromwell; and convinces him&s;elf that on &s;uch a golden pur|&s;uit
it is even <HI>prudent</HI> to &s;take a precarious and in&s;ipid life. We may
add, that the mo&s;t daring flights of ambition are as often the effects
of nece&s;&s;ity as of choice. The princes of Hindo&s;tan mu&s;t either
reign or peri&s;h; and when Cae&s;ar pa&s;&s;ed the Rubicon, it was &s;carcely
po&s;&s;ibly for him to return to a private &s;tation. 3. You think, Sir,
we may learn from our own experience, that an indifference con|cerning
miracles is very compatible with a full conviction of their
truth; and &s;o it undoubtedly is with &s;uch a conviction as we have
an opportunity of ob&s;erving.</P>

<P>I BEG ten thou&s;and pardons for not being dead, as I certainly ought
to be. But &s;uch is my abject nature, that I had rather live in
Bentinck-&s;treet, attainted and convicted of the &s;in of lazine&s;s, than
enjoy your applau&s;e either at old Nick's or even in the Ely&s;ian Fields.
After all, could you expect that I &s;hould honour with my corre|&s;pondence
a wild barbarian of the Bogs of Erin? Had the natives
intercepted my letter, the terrors occa&s;ioned by &s;uch unknown magic
characters might have been fatal to you. But now you have e&s;caped
the fury of their ho&s;pitality, and are arrived among a cee-vi-leezed
nation, I may venture to renew my intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>You tell me of a long li&s;t of dukes, lords, and chieftains of re|nown
to whom you are introduced; were I with you, I &s;hould
prefer one <HI>David</HI> to them all. When you are at Edinburgh, I hope
you will not fail to vi&s;it the &s;tye of that fatte&s;t of Epicurus's hogs,
and inform your&s;elf whether there remains no hope of its reco|vering
the u&s;e of its right paw. There is another animal of <HI>great,</HI>
though not perhaps of <HI>equal,</HI> and certainly not of <HI>&s;imilar</HI> merit,
one Robert&s;on; has he almo&s;t created the new world? Many other
men you have undoubtedly &s;een, in the country where you are at
pre&s;ent, who mu&s;t have commanded your e&s;teem: but when you
return, if you are not very hone&s;t, you will po&s;&s;e&s;s great advantages
over me in any di&s;pute concerning Caledonian merit.</P>
<P>Boodle's and Atwood's are now no more. The la&s;t &s;tragglers,
and Godfrey Clarke in the rear of all, are moved away to their
<PB N="471" REF="492">
&s;everal ca&s;tles; and I now enjoy, in the mid&s;t of London, a delicious
&s;olitude. My library, Ken&s;ington Gardens, and a few parties with
new acquaintance who are chained to London, (among whom I
reckon Gold&s;mith and Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds,) fill up my time, and
the mon&s;ter <HI>Ennui</HI> pre&s;erves a very re&s;pectful di&s;tance. By the bye,
your friends Batt, Sir John Ru&s;&s;ell, and La&s;celles, dined with me one
day before they &s;et off; for I &s;ometimes give the prettie&s;t little dinner
in the world. But all this compo&s;ure draws near its conclu&s;ion.
About the &s;ixteenth of this month Mr. Eliot carries me away, and after
picking up Mrs. Gibbon at Bath, &s;ets me down at Port Eliot: there
I &s;hall certainly remain &s;ix weeks, or, in other words, to the end of
September. My future motions, whether to London, Derby&s;hire,
or a longer &s;tay in Cornwall, (pray is not "motion to &s;tay" rather
in the Hibernian &s;tyle?) will depend on the life of Port Eliot, the
time of the meeting of parliament, and perhaps the impatience of
Mr. *, Lord of Lenborough. One of my plea&s;ures in
town I forgot to mention, the unexpected vi&s;it of Deyverdun, who
accompanies his young lord (very young indeed!) on a two months
tour to England. He took the opportunity of the Earl's going
down to the Duke of *, to &s;pend a fortnight (nor do
I recollect a more plea&s;ant one) in Bentinck-&s;treet. They are now
gone together into York&s;hire, and I think it doubtful whether I
&s;hall &s;ee him again before his return to Leip&s;ic. It is a melancholy
reflection, that while one is plagued with acquaintance at the corner
of every &s;treet, real friends &s;hould be &s;eparated from each other by
un&s;urmountable bars, and obliged to catch at a few tran&s;ient mo|ments
of interview. I de&s;ire that you and my Lady (whom I
mo&s;t re&s;pectfully greet) would take your &s;hare of that very new
and acute ob&s;ervation, not &s;o large a &s;hare indeed as my Swi&s;s friend,
&s;ince nature and fortune give <HI>us</HI> more frequent opportunities of being
together. You cannot expect news from a de&s;art, and &s;uch is
<PB N="472" REF="493">
London at pre&s;ent. The papers give you the full harve&s;t of public
intelligence; and I imagine that the eloquent nymphs of Twicken|ham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;s Cambridges.</NOTE>
communicate all the tran&s;actions of the polite, the amorous,
and the marrying world. The great pantomime of Port&s;mouth was
univer&s;ally admired; and I am angry at my own lazine&s;s in ne|glecting
an excellent opportunity of &s;eeing it. Foote has given us
the Bankrupt, a &s;erious and &s;entimental piece, with very &s;evere
&s;trictures on the licence of &s;candal in attacking private characters.
Adieu. Forgive and epi&s;tolize me. I &s;hall not believe you &s;incere
in the former, unle&s;s you make Bentinck-&s;treet your inn. I fear
I &s;hall be gone; but Mrs. Ford<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His hou&s;ekeeper.</NOTE> and the parrot will be proud to

A word too, if you plea&s;e, concerning father and &s;i&s;ter; to
<PB N="473" REF="494">
the latter I enclo&s;e a receipt from Mrs. G. who is now with me at
Port Eliot.</P>
<P>Blind as you accu&s;e me of being to the beauties of nature, I am
wonderfully plea&s;ed with this country. Of her three dull notes,
<HI>ground, plants,</HI> and <HI>water,</HI> Cornwall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the fir&s;t and la&s;t in
very high perfection. Think of a hundred &s;olitary &s;treams peace|fully
gliding between amazing cliffs on one &s;ide, and rich meadows
on the other, gradually &s;welling by the aid of the tide into noble
rivers, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively lo&s;ing them&s;elves in each other, and all at length
terminating in the harbour of Plymouth, who&s;e broad expan&s;e is
irregularly <HI>dotted</HI> with two-and-forty line of battle &s;hips. In plants
indeed we are deficient; and though all the gentlemen now attend
to po&s;terity, the country will for a long time be very naked. We
have &s;pent &s;everal days agreeably enough in little parties; but in
general our time rolls away in complete uniformity. Our landlord
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es neither a pack of hounds, nor a &s;table of running hor&s;es,
nor a large farm, nor a good library. The la&s;t only could intere&s;t
me; but it is &s;ingular that a man of fortune, who choo&s;es to
pa&s;s nine months of the year in the country, &s;hould have none of
them.</P>
<P>According to our pre&s;ent de&s;ign, Mrs. G. and my&s;elf return to
Bath about the beginning of next month. I &s;hall probably make
but a &s;hort &s;tay with her, and defer my Derby&s;hire journey till ano|ther
year. Sufficient for the &s;ummer is the evil thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> one
di&s;tant country excur&s;ion. Natural inclination, the pro&s;ecution of
my great work, and the conclu&s;ion of my Lenborough bu&s;ine&s;s,
plead &s;trongly in favour of London. However I de&s;ire, and one
always finds time for what one really de&s;ires, to vi&s;it Sheffield-Place
before the end of October, &s;hould it only be for a few days.
I know &s;everal hou&s;es where I am invited to think my&s;elf at home,
but I know no other where I &s;eem inclined to accept of the invita|tion.

I forgot to tell you, that I have declined the publication of
Lord Che&s;terfield's Letters. The public will &s;ee them, and upon
the whole, I think, with plea&s;ure; but the family were &s;trongly
bent again&s;t it; and e&s;pecially on Deyverdun's account, I deemed
it more prudent to avoid making them my per&s;onal enemies.</P>

<P>AT length I am a little more at liberty. Godfrey Clarke went
out of town this morning. In&s;tead of going directly into Der|by&s;hire,
where he would have been overwhelmed with vi&s;its, &amp;c.
he has taken his &s;i&s;ter, brother, and aunts to a villa near Farnham,
in which he has the happine&s;s of having no neighbourhood. If my
e&s;teem and friend&s;hip for Godfrey had been capable of any addition,
it would have been very much increa&s;ed by the manner in which he
<PB N="480" REF="501">
felt and lamented his father's death. He is now in very different
circum&s;tances than before; in&s;tead of an ea&s;y and ample allowance,
he has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great e&s;tate, with low rents and high
incumbrances. I hope the one may make amends for the other:
under your conduct I am &s;ure they would, and I have freely offered
him your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in ca&s;e he &s;hould wi&s;h to apply for it.</P>
<P>In the mean time I mu&s;t not forget my own affairs, which &s;eem

heard from him. I have &s;ome thoughts of writing <HI>my&s;elf</HI> to the
jockey, &s;tating the various &s;teps of the affair, and offering him, with
polite firmne&s;s, the <HI>immediate</HI> choice of Chancery or arbitration.</P>
<P>For the time, however, I forgot all the&s;e difficulties, in the pre|&s;ent
enjoyment of Deyverdun's company; and I glory in thinking,
that although my hou&s;e is &s;mall, it is ju&s;t of a &s;ufficient &s;ize to hold

<P>LAST night was the triumph of Boodle's. Our ma&s;querade co&s;t
two thou&s;and guineas; a &s;um that might have fertili&s;ed a pro|vince,
(I &s;peak in your own &s;tyle,) vani&s;hed in a few hours, but
not without leaving behind it the fame of the mo&s;t &s;plendid and ele|gant

It would be as difficult to de&s;cribe the magnificence of the
&s;cene, as it would be ea&s;y to record the humour of the night. The
one was above, the other below, all relation. I left the Pantheon
about five this morning, ro&s;e at ten, took a good walk, and returned
home to a more rational entertainment of Batt, Sir John Ru&s;&s;ell, and
La&s;celles, who dined with me. They have left me this moment; and
were I to enumerate the things &s;aid of Sheffield, it would form a
much longer letter than I have any inclination to write. Let it
&s;uffice, that Sir John means to pa&s;s in Su&s;&s;ex the interval of the two
terms. Every thing, in a word, goes on very plea&s;antly, except
the terre&s;trial bu&s;ine&s;s of Lenborough. La&s;t Saturday &s;e'nnight I

<P>DO you remember that there exi&s;ts in the world one Edward
Gibbon, a hou&s;ekeeper in Bentinck-&s;treet? If the &s;tandard
of writing and of affection were the &s;ame, I am &s;ure he would ill-de&s;erve
it. I do not wi&s;h to di&s;cover, how many days (I am afraid
I ought to u&s;e another word) have elap&s;ed &s;ince the date of my la&s;t,
or even of your la&s;t letter, and yet &s;uch is the &s;luggi&s;h nature of the
bea&s;t, that I am afraid nothing but the arrival of Mrs. Bonfoy, and
the expectation of Mr. Eliot, could have rou&s;ed me from my le|thargy.
The Lady gave me great &s;atisfaction, by her general ac|count
of your health and &s;pirits, but communicated &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s,
by the mention of a little encounter, in the &s;tyle of one of Don
Quixote's, but which proved, I hope, as trifling as you at fir&s;t ima|gined
it. For my own part, I am well in mind and body, bu&s;y
with my books, (which may perhaps produce &s;omething next year,
either to tire or amu&s;e the world,) and every day more &s;atisfied with
my pre&s;ent mode of life, which I always believed was calculated to
make me happy. My only remaining unea&s;ine&s;s is Lenborough,
which is not terminated. By Holroyd's advice, I rather try what
may be obtained by a little more patience, than ru&s;h at once into
the horrors of Chancery. But let us talk of &s;omething el&s;e. Mrs.
Porten grows younger every day. You remember, I think, in New|man-&s;treet,
an agreeable woman, Mi&s;s W ****. The Under-&s;ecre|tary
is &s;eriou&s;ly in love with her, and &s;eriou&s;ly unea&s;y that his preca|rious
&s;ituation precludes him from happine&s;s. We &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee which
will get the better, love or rea&s;on. I bet three to two on love.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="505">
Gue&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e, when Mrs. Gibbon of Northampton&s;hire &s;ud|denly
communicated her arrival. I immediately went to Surrey|&s;treet,
where &s;he lodged, but though it was no more than half
an hour after nine, the Saint had fini&s;hed her evening devotions,
and was already retired to re&s;t. Ye&s;terday morning (by appoint|ment)
I breakfa&s;ted with her at eight o'clock, dined with her to|day
at two in Newman-&s;treet, and am ju&s;t returned from &s;etting her
down. She is, in truth, a very great curio&s;ity: her dre&s;s and figure
exceed any thing we had at the ma&s;querade: her language and ideas
belong to the la&s;t century. However, in point of religion &s;he was
rational; that is to &s;ay, &s;ilent. I do not believe that &s;he a&s;ked a
&s;ingle que&s;tion, or &s;aid the lea&s;t thing concerning it. To me &s;he
behaved with great cordiality, and <HI>in her way</HI> expre&s;&s;ed a great

times;</HI> the &s;econd <HI>twice,</HI> and all the others have undergone reviews,
corrections, &amp;c. As to the tail, it is perfectly formed and dige&s;ted,
(and were I &s;o much given to &s;elf-content and ha&s;te,) it is almo&s;t
all written. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical part, for in&s;tance, is written out in four|teen
&s;heets, which I mean to <HI>refondre</HI> from beginning to end. As
to the friendly critic, it is very difficult to find one who has lei&s;ure,
candour, freedom, and knowledge &s;ufficient. However, Batt and
Deyverdun have read and ob&s;erved. After all, the public is the be&s;t
critic. I print no more than five hundred copies of the fir&s;t edition;
and the &s;econd (as it happens frequently to my betters) may receive
many improvements. So much for Rome. We have nothing new
from America. But I can venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that admini&s;tration
is now as unanimous and decided as the occa&s;ion requires. Some|thing
will be done this year; but in the Spring the force of the
country will be exerted to the utmo&s;t. Scotch Highlanders, Iri&s;h
Papi&s;ts, Hanoverians, Canadians, Indians, &amp;c. will all in various
&s;hapes be employed. Parliament meets the fir&s;t week in November.
I think his Catholic Maje&s;ty may be &s;atisfied with his Summer's
amu&s;ement. The Spaniards fought with great bravery, and made a
fine retreat; but our Algerine friends &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them as much in
conduct as in number. Adieu.</P>

(if they refre&s;h them&s;elves in England or Ireland,) will you go and
&s;ee their camp? We have great hopes of getting a body of the&s;e
Barbarians. In con&s;equence of &s;ome very plain advances, King
George, with his own hand, wrote a very polite epi&s;tle to &s;i&s;ter
Kitty, reque&s;ting her friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Full powers and in&s;truc|tions

on condition, however&punc; that they &s;hould &s;erve, not as auxiliaries,
but as mercenaries, and that the Ru&s;&s;ian general &s;hould be ab&s;olutely
under the command of the Briti&s;h. They daily and hourly expect
a me&s;&s;enger, and hope to hear that the bu&s;ine&s;s is concluded. The
wor&s;t of it is, that the Baltic will &s;oon be frozen up, and that it mu&s;t
be late next year before they can get to America. 2. In the mean
time we are not quite ea&s;y about Canada; and even if it &s;hould be
&s;afe from an attack, we cannot flatter our&s;elves with the expectation
of bringing down that martial people on the Back Settlements. The
prie&s;ts are ours; the gentlemen very prudently wait the event, and
are di&s;po&s;ed to join the &s;tronger party; but the &s;ame lawle&s;s &s;pirit
and impatience of government which have infected our Colonies, are
gone forth among the Canadian pea&s;ants, over whom, &s;ince the

<P>* * * * SINCE my la&s;t I have read Mr. Gibbon's Hi&s;|tory

It is a work of very high merit indeed. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that indu&s;try
<PB N="499" REF="520">
of re&s;earch, without which no man de&s;erves the name of an Hi&s;torian.
His narrative is per&s;picuous and intere&s;ting; his &s;tyle is elegant and
forcible, though in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages I think rather too laboured, and in
others too quaint. But the&s;e defects are amply compen&s;ated by the
beauty of the general flow of language, and a very peculiar hap|pine&s;s
in many of his expre&s;&s;ions. I have traced him in many of
his quotations, (for experience has taught me to &s;u&s;pect the accuracy
of my brother pen-men,) and I find he refers to no pa&s;&s;age but what
he has &s;een with his own eyes. I hope the book will be as &s;ucce&s;sful
as it de&s;erves to be. I have not yet read the two la&s;t chapters, but
am &s;orry, from what I have heard of them, that he has taken &s;uch

<P>***** I AM very much taken with Mr. Gibbon's
Roman Hi&s;tory, which came from your
pre&s;s, and am glad to hear of its &s;ucce&s;s. There will no books of
reputation now be printed in London but through your hands and Mr.

edition. I re&s;olved to have given him my advice with regard to the
manner of printing it; but as I am now writing to you, it is the
&s;ame thing. He ought certainly to print the number of the chapter
at the head of the margin; and it would be better if &s;omething of
the contents could al&s;o be added. One is al&s;o plagued with his notes,
according to the pre&s;ent method of printing the book: when a note
is announced, you turn to the end of the volume; and there you

often find nothing but a reference to an authority. All the&s;e autho|rities
ought only to be printed at the margin, or the bottom of the

Gibbon; as wi&s;hing that gentleman, whom I &s;o highly value, &s;hould

<P>I SHOULD make &s;ome apology for not writing you &s;ooner an an|&s;wer
to your obliging letter: but if you &s;hould honour me fre|quently
with &s;uch reque&s;ts, you will find, that, with very good in|tentions,
I am a very dilatory and irregular corre&s;pondent. I am
&s;orry to tell you, that our re&s;pectable friend<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hume.</NOTE> is &s;till declining in his
health; he is greatly emaciated, and lo&s;es &s;trength. He talks fami|liarly
of his near pro&s;pect of dying. His mother, it &s;eems, died
under the &s;ame &s;ymptoms; and it appears &s;o little nece&s;&s;ary, or
proper, to flatter him, that no one attempts it. I never ob&s;erved
his under&s;tanding more clear, or his humour more plea&s;ant and
lively. He has a great aver&s;ion to leave the tranquillity of his own
hou&s;e, to go in &s;earch of health among inns and ho&s;tlers. And his
friends here gave way to him for &s;ome time; but now think it
nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould make an effort to try what change of place
and air, or any thing el&s;e Sir John Pringle may advi&s;e, can do for
<PB N="502" REF="523">
him. I left him this morning in the mind to comply in this article,
and I hope that he will be prevailed on to &s;et out in a few days. He
is ju&s;t now &s;ixty-five.</P>
<P>I am very glad that the plea&s;ure you give us recoils a little on
your&s;elf, through our feeble te&s;timony. I have, as you &s;uppo&s;e,
been employed, at any intervals of lei&s;ure or re&s;t I have had for
&s;ome years, in taking notes, or collecting materials, for a Hi&s;tory
of the di&s;tractions that broke down the Roman Republic, and
ended in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Augu&s;tus and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.
The compliment you are plea&s;ed to pay, I cannot accept of, even to
my &s;ubject. Your &s;ubject now appears with advantages it was not
&s;uppo&s;ed to have had; and I &s;u&s;pect that the magnificence of the
mouldering ruin will appear more &s;triking, than the &s;ame building
when the view is perplexed with &s;caffolding, workmen, and di&s;or|derly
lodgers, and the ear is &s;tunned with the noi&s;e of de&s;tructions
and repairs, and the alarms of fire. The night which you begin
to de&s;cribe is &s;olemn, and there are gleams of light &s;uperior to what
is to be found in any other time. I comfort my&s;elf, that as my
trade is the &s;tudy of human nature, I could not fix on a more inte|re&s;ting
corner of it, than the end of the Roman Republic. Whether
my compilations &s;hould ever de&s;erve the attention of any one be&s;ides
my&s;elf, mu&s;t remain to be determined after they are farther advanced.
I take the liberty to trouble you with the inclo&s;ed for Mr. Smith,
who&s;e uncertain &s;tay in London makes me at a lo&s;s how to direct for

more than &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and men with him. Clinton de&s;igns to

greater confequence, a province made its &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ired to
be rein&s;tated in the peace of the King. It is indeed only poor little
Georgia; and the application was made to Governor Tonyn of Flo|rida.
Some di&s;gu&s;t at a violent &s;tep of the Congre&s;s, who removed
the Pre&s;ident of their Provincial A&s;&s;embly, a leading and popular

<P>WHEN I ventured to a&s;&s;ume the character of Hi&s;torian, the fir&s;t,
the mo&s;t natural, but at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t ambitious,
wi&s;h which I entertained, was to obtain the approbation of Dr. Ro|bert&s;on
and of Mr. Hume; two names which friend&s;hip united, and
which po&s;terity will never &s;eparate. I &s;hall not therefore attempt to
di&s;&s;emble, though I cannot ea&s;ily expre&s;s, the plea&s;ure which I re|ceived
from your obliging letter, as well as from the intelligence of
your mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ent. The &s;atifaction which I &s;hould other|wi&s;e
have enjoyed, in common with the public, will now be height|ened
by a &s;entiment of a more per&s;onal and flattering nature; and
I &s;hall frequently whi&s;per to my&s;elf, that I have in &s;ome mea&s;ure:
de&s;erved the e&s;teem of the writer whom I admire.</P>
<P><PB N="520" REF="541">
A &s;hort excur&s;ion which I have made to this place, during the
&s;ummer months, has occa&s;ioned &s;ome delay in my receiving your
letter, and will prevent my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, till my return, the copy of
your Hi&s;tory, which you &s;o politely de&s;ired Mr. Strahan to &s;end me.
But I have already gratified the eagerne&s;s of my impatience; and
although I was obliged to return the book much &s;ooner than I could
have wi&s;hed, I have &s;een enough to convince me, that the pre&s;ent
publication will &s;upport, and, if po&s;&s;ible, will extend the fame of
the Author; that the materials are collected with diligence, and ar|ranged
with &s;kill; that the fir&s;t book contains a learned and &s;atisfac|tory
account of the progre&s;s of di&s;covery; that the achievements,
the dangers, and the crimes, of the Spani&s;h adventures are related
with a temperate &s;pirit; and that the mo&s;t original, perhaps the
mo&s;t curious, portion of the hi&s;tory of human manners is at length
re&s;cued from the hands of &s;ophi&s;ts and declaimers. Lord Stormont,
and the few in this Capital, who have had an opportunity of per|u&s;ing
the Hi&s;tory of America, unanimou&s;ly concur in the &s;ame
&s;entiments. Your work is already become a favourite topic of public
conver&s;ation; and Mr. Suard is repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed, in my hearing,
to fix the time when his tran&s;lation will appear.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf you will not abandon your de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Lon|don
next winter; as I already anticipate, in my own mind, the ad|vantages
which I &s;hall derive from &s;o plea&s;ing and &s;o honourable a
connection. In the mean while, I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf happy, if
you could think of any literary commi&s;&s;ion, in the execution of
which I might be u&s;eful to you at Paris, where I propo&s;e to &s;tay till
very near the meeting of Parliament. Let me, for in&s;tance, &s;ugge&s;t
an enquiry, which cannot be indifferent to you, and which might
perhaps be within my reach. A few days ago I dined with Bagni|ou&s;ky,
the famous adventurer, who e&s;caped from his exile at Kam|&s;chat&s;ka,
and returned into Europe by Japan and China. His nar|rative
<PB N="521" REF="542">
was amu&s;ing, though I know not how far his veracity, in point
of circum&s;tances, may &s;afely be tru&s;ted. It was his original de&s;ign
to penetrate through the North Ea&s;t Pa&s;&s;age; and he actually fol|lowed
the coa&s;t of A&s;ia as high as the latitude of 67&deg; 35&prime;, till his
progre&s;s was &s;topped by the ice, in a Streight between the two
Continents, which was only &s;even leagues broad. Thence he de|&s;cended
along the coa&s;t of America, as low as Cape Mendocin; but
was repul&s;ed by contrary winds, in his attempts to reach the port of
Acapulco. The Journal of his Voyage, with his original Charts, is
now at Ver&s;ailles, in the <HI>Dep&oacute;t des Affaires Etrangers;</HI> and if you
conceived that it would be of any u&s;e to you for a &s;econd edition, I
would try what might be obtained; though I am not ignorant of
that mean jealou&s;y which you your&s;elf have experienced, and &s;o
de&s;ervedly &s;tigmati&s;ed. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>N^o XCVII. Dr. ROBERTSON to Mr. GIBBON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of your obliging Letter, and I &s;hould be a very
proud man indeed, if I were not vain of the approbation which
you are plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon me. As you will now have had an
opportunity to peru&s;e the book, which you had only &s;een when you
wrote to me, I indulge my&s;elf in the hopes, that the favourable opi|nion
you had formed of it, is not dimini&s;hed. I am much plea&s;ed
with your mentioning my friend&s;hip with Mr. Hume; I have al|ways
con&s;idered that as one of the mo&s;t fortunate and honourable
circum&s;tances of my life. It is a felicity of the age and country in
which we live, that men of letters can enter the &s;ame walk of &s;cience,
and go on &s;ucce&s;sfully, without feeling one &s;entiment of envy or
<PB N="522" REF="543">
rival&s;hip. In the intercour&s;e between Mr. Hume and me, we always
found <HI>&s;omething to blame,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;omething to commend.</HI> I have
received frequently very valuable critici&s;ms on my performances
from him; and I have &s;ometimes ventured to offer him my &s;trictures
on his works. Permit me to hope for the &s;ame indulgence from
you. If, in reading the Hi&s;tory of America, any thing, either in
the matter or &s;tyle, has occurred to you as reprehen&s;ible, I will deem
it a mo&s;t obliging favour if you will communicate it freely to me.
I am certain of profiting by &s;uch a communication.</P>
<P>I return you thanks for your frank offer of executing any literary
commi&s;&s;ion for me. I accept of it without ceremony, and am flat|tered
with the idea of receiving &s;uch aid from your hands. I know
nothing of Bagniou&s;ki's Adventures, but what was publi&s;hed in &s;ome
New&s;paper. If one can rely on his veracity, what he relates mu&s;t
be very intere&s;ting to me. If you had been writing the Hi&s;tory of
America, the que&s;tion concerning the mode of peopling it, might
not perhaps have occupied your attention very much. But it was
proper for me to con&s;ider it more fully. Bagniou&s;ki (if he may be
credited) has &s;een what it may be u&s;eful for me to know. I can &s;ee
no rea&s;on why the Court of France &s;hould be &s;hy about communi|cating
his Journal, and the Charts which illu&s;trate it; po&s;&s;ibly my
name may operate &s;omewhat towards obtaining a copy of both;
your interpo&s;ition, I am confident, will do a great deal. It will be
very illiberal indeed, if &s;uch a communication were refu&s;ed. My Lord
Stormont (by who&s;e attention I have been much honoured) would
not decline to give his aid, were that nece&s;&s;ary. But if your Court
re&s;embles that of Spain, I am afraid every propo&s;al from an am|ba&s;&s;ador
is received with &s;ome degree of jealou&s;y. Your own private
application will, I apprehend, be more effectual. As it is pro|bable
that a &s;econd edition may go to pre&s;s early in the winter, it
will add to the favour, if you can &s;oon inform me concerning the
&s;ucce&s;s of your negociation. As this is &s;omething in the &s;tyle of
<PB N="523" REF="544">
the <HI>Corps Diplomatique,</HI> allow me to recommend one of its members
to you. Mr. Fullarton, the new &s;ecretary of the emba&s;&s;y, is a par|ticular
friend of mine. He is a young man of &s;uch qualities both of
head and heart, that I am &s;ure you will e&s;teem and love him. Plea&s;e

<OPENER><DATELINE>PARIS, <DATE>June 16, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I TOLD you what would infallibly happen, and you know enough
of the nature of the bea&s;t not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at it. I have now
been at Paris exactly five weeks; during which time I have not
written to any per&s;on what&s;oever within the Briti&s;h dominions, ex|cept
two lines of notification to Mrs. Gibbon. The daemon of pro|cra&s;tination
has at length yielded to the genius of friend&s;hip, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
indeed by the powers of fear and &s;hame. But when I have &s;eated
my&s;elf before a table, and begin to revolve all that I have &s;een
and ta&s;ted during this bu&s;y period, I feel my&s;elf oppre&s;&s;ed and
confounded; and I am very near throwing away the pen, and re|&s;igning
my&s;elf to indolent de&s;pair. A complete hi&s;tory would re|quire
a volume, at lea&s;t, as corpulent as the Decline and Fall; and if
I attempt to &s;elect and abridge, be&s;ides the difficulty of the choice,
there occur &s;o many things which cannot properly be entru&s;ted to
paper, and &s;o many others of too &s;light a texture to &s;upport the
journey, that I am almo&s;t tempted to re&s;erve for our future conver|&s;ations
the detail of my plea&s;ures and occupations. But as I am &s;en|&s;ible
that you are <HI>rigid</HI> and impatient, I will try to convey, in a few
words, a general idea of my &s;ituation as a man of the world, and as
<PB N="524" REF="545">
a man of letters. You remember that the Neckers were my princi|pal
dependance; and the reception which I have met with from them
very far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. I do not indeed
lodge in their hou&s;e, (as it might incite the jealou&s;y of the hu&s;band,
and procure me a lettre de cachet,) but I live very much with them,
and dine and &s;up whenever they have company, which is almo&s;t
every day, and whenever I like it, for they are not in the lea&s;t <HI>exi|geans.</HI>
Mr. Walpole gave me an introduction to Madame du Def|fand,
an agreeable young lady of eighty-two years of age, who has
con&s;tant &s;uppers, and the be&s;t company in Paris. When you &s;ee the
Duke of Richmond, he will give you an account of that hou&s;e, where
I meet him almo&s;t every evening. A&s;k him about Madame de Cam|bis.
I have met the Duke of Choi&s;eul at his particular reque&s;t,
dined by <HI>accident</HI> with Franklin, conver&s;ed with the Emperor, been
pre&s;ented at court, and gradually, or rather rapidly, I find my
acquaintance &s;preading over the mo&s;t valuable parts of Paris. They
pretend to like me, and whatever you may think of French profe&s;|&s;ions,
I am convinced that &s;ome at lea&s;t are &s;incere. On the other
hand, I feel my&s;elf ea&s;y and happy in their company, and only regret
that I did not come over two or three months &s;ooner. Though Paris
throughout the &s;ummer promi&s;es me a very agreeable &s;ociety, yet I
am hurt every day by the departure of men and women whom I begin
to know with &s;ome familiarity, the departure of officers for their go|vernments
and garri&s;ons, of bi&s;hops for their dioce&s;es, and even of
country gentlemen for their e&s;tates, as a rural ta&s;te gains ground in
this country. So much for the general idea of my acquaintance;
details would be endle&s;s, yet un&s;atisfactory. You may add, to the
plea&s;ures of &s;ociety tho&s;e of the &s;pectacles and promenades, and you
will find that I lead a very agreeable life; let me ju&s;t conde&s;cend to
ob&s;erve, that it is not extravagant. After decking my&s;elf out with
&s;ilks and &s;ilver, the ordinary e&s;tabli&s;hment of coach, lodging, &s;ervants,
eating, and pocket expences, does not exceed &s;ixty pounds <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="525" REF="546">
month. Yet I have two footmen in hand&s;ome liveries behind my
coach, and my apartment is hung with dama&s;k. Adieu for the pre|&s;ent:
I have more to &s;ay, but were I to attempt any farther progre&s;s,
you mu&s;t wait another po&s;t; and you have already waited long
enough, of all con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Let me ju&s;t in two words give you an idea of my day. I am now
going (nine o'clock) to the King's library, where I &s;hall &s;tay till twelve;
as &s;oon as I am dre&s;&s;ed, I &s;et out to dine with the Duke de Nivernois;
&s;hall go from thence to the French comedy, into the Prince&s;s de
Beauveau's loge grill&eacute;e, and cannot quite determine whether I &s;hall
&s;up at Madame du Deffand's, Madame Necker's, or the Sardinian
Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s's. Once more adieu.</P>
<P>I embrace my Lady and <HI>Bambini.</HI> I &s;hall with cheerfulne&s;s exe|cute
any of her commi&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>WELL, and who is the culprit now?&mdash;Thus far had I written in
the pride of my heart, and fully determined to inflict an epi&s;tle
upon you, even before I received any an&s;wer to my former; I was
very near a bull. But this forward half line lay ten days barren and
inactive, till its generative powers were excited by the mi&s;&s;ive which
I received ye&s;terday. What a wretched piece of work do we &s;eem to
be making of it in America? The greate&s;t force which any European
power ever ventured to tran&s;port into that continent, is not &s;trong
enough even to attack the enemy; the naval &s;trength of Great Britain
is not &s;ufficient to prevent the Americans (they have almo&s;t lo&s;t the
appellation of Rebels) from receiving every a&s;&s;i&s;tance that they
<PB N="526" REF="547">
wanted; and in the mean time you are obliged to call out the militia
to defend your own coa&s;ts again&s;t their privateers. You po&s;&s;ibly may
expect from me &s;ome account of the de&s;igns and policy of the French
court, but I choo&s;e to decline that ta&s;k for two rea&s;ons: 1&s;t, Becau&s;e
you may find them laid open in every new&s;paper; and 2dly, Becau&s;e
I live too much with their courtiers and mini&s;ters to know any thing
about them. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that I am not under any immediate
apprehen&s;ions of a war with France. It is much more plea&s;ant as
well as profitable to view in &s;afety the raging of the tempe&s;t, occa|&s;ionally
to pick up &s;ome pieces of the wreck, and to improve their
trade, their agriculture, and their finances, while the two countries
are <HI>lento colli&s;a duello.</HI> Far from taking any &s;tep to put a &s;peedy end
to this a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;pute, I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed if next &s;ummer
they were to lend their cordial a&s;&s;i&s;tance to England, as to the weaker
party. As to my per&s;onal engagement with the D. of R. I recollect
a few &s;light &s;kirmi&s;hes, but nothing that de&s;erves the name of a ge|neral
engagement. The extravagance of &s;ome di&s;putants, both
French and Engli&s;h, who have e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of America, &s;ome|times
in&s;pires me with an extraordinary vigour. Upon the whole, I
find it much ea&s;ier to defend the ju&s;tice than the policy of our mea|&s;ures;
but there are certain ca&s;es, where whatever is repugnant to
&s;ound policy cea&s;es to be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>The more I &s;ee of Paris, the more I like it. The regular cour&s;e
of the &s;ociety in which I live is ea&s;y, polite, and entertaining;
and almo&s;t every day is marked by the acqui&s;ition of &s;ome new
acquaintance, who is worth cultivating, or who, at lea&s;t, is worth re|membering.
To the great admiration of the French, I regularly
dine and regularly &s;up, drink a di&s;h of &s;trong coffee after each meal,
and find my &s;tomach a citizen of the world. The &s;pectacles, (parti|cularly
the Italian, and above all the French Comedies,) which are
open the whole &s;ummer, afford me an agreeable relaxation from com|pany;
and to &s;hew you that I frequent them from ta&s;te, and not from
<PB N="527" REF="548">
idlene&s;s, I have not yet &s;een the Coli&s;ee, the Vauxhall, the Boul|vards,
or any of tho&s;e places of entertainment which con&s;titute Paris
to mo&s;t of our countrymen. Occa&s;ional trips to dine or &s;up in &s;ome
of the thou&s;and country-hou&s;es which are &s;cattered round the envi|rons
of Paris, &s;erve to vary the &s;cene. In the mean while the &s;um|mer
in&s;en&s;ibly glides away, and the fatal month of October approaches,
when I mu&s;t change the hou&s;e of Madame Necker for the Hou&s;e of
Commons. I regret that I could not choo&s;e the winter, in&s;tead of the
&s;ummer, for this excur&s;ion: I &s;hould have found many valuable per|&s;ons,
and &s;hould have pre&s;erved others whom I have lo&s;t as I began
to know them. The Duke de Choi&s;eul, who de&s;erves attention both
for him&s;elf, and for keeping the be&s;t hou&s;e in Paris, pa&s;&s;es &s;even
months of the year in Touraine; and though I have been tempted, I
con&s;ider with horror a journey of &s;ixty leagues into the country.
The Prince&s;s of Beauveau, who is a mo&s;t &s;uperior woman, has been
ab&s;ent above &s;ix weeks, and does not return till the 24th of this
month. A large body of recruits will be a&s;&s;embled by the Fontain|bleau
journey; but in order to have a thorough knowledge of this
&s;plendid country, I ought to &s;tay till the month of January; and if
I could be &s;ure that Oppo&s;ition would be as tranquil as they were la&s;t
year&mdash;I think your life has been as animated, or, at lea&s;t, as tumul|tuous,
and I envy you Lady Payne, &amp;c. much more than either the
Primate, or the Chief-ju&s;tice. Let not the generous brea&s;t of my Lady
be torn by the black &s;erpents of envy. She &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the fir&s;t place

<P>YOU do not readily believe in praeternatural mi&s;carriages of letters;
nor I neither. Li&s;ten, however, to a plain and hone&s;t narra|tive.
This morning after breakfa&s;t, as I was ruminating on <HI>your</HI>
&s;ilence, Thomas, my new footman, with confu&s;ion in his looks and
&s;tammering on his tongue, produced a letter rea&s;onably &s;oiled, which
he was to have brought me the day of his arrival, and which had
lain forgotten from that time in his pocket. To &s;horten as much
as po&s;&s;ible the continuance, I immediately enquired, whether any
method of conveyance could be devi&s;ed more expeditious than the
po&s;t, and was fortunately informed of your coachman's intentions.
You probably know the heads of the plan; an Act of Parliament to
declare, that we never <HI>had</HI> any intention of taxing America: another
Act, to empower the Crown to name Commi&s;&s;ioners, authori&s;ed to
&s;u&s;pend ho&s;tilities by &s;ea and land, as well as all obnoxious Acts;
and, in &s;hort, to grant every thing, except independence. Oppo|&s;ition,
after expre&s;&s;ing their doubts whether the lance of Achilles
could cure the wound which it had inflicted, could not refu&s;e their
a&s;&s;ent to the principles of conduct which they them&s;elves had always
recommended. Yet you mu&s;t acknowledge, that in a bu&s;ine&s;s of
this magnitude there may ari&s;e &s;everal important que&s;tions, which,
without a &s;pirit of faction, will de&s;erve to be debated: whether Par|liament
ought not to name the Commi&s;&s;ioners? whether it would
not be better to repeal the obnoxious Acts our&s;elves? I do not find
that the world; that is, a few people whom I happen to conver&s;e
with; are much inclined to prai&s;e Lord N.'s ductility of temper.
In the &s;ervice of next Friday you will, however, take notice of the
injunction given by the Liturgy: <Q>And all the People &s;hall &s;ay
<PB N="532" REF="553">
after the <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> Turn us again, O Lord, and &s;o &s;hall we be
turned.</Q> While we con&s;ider whether we &s;hall negociate, I fear
the French have been more diligent. It is po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, both
in private and in Parliament, and not contradicted by the Mini&s;ters,
that on the fifth of this month a Treaty of Commerce (which na|turally
leads to a war) was &s;igned at Paris with the independent
States of America. Yet there &s;till remains a hope that England may
obtain the preference. The two greate&s;t countries in Europe are
fairly running a race for the favour of America.</P>

<P>As bu&s;ine&s;s thickens, and you may expect me to write &s;ometimes,
I &s;hall lay down one rule; totally to avoid political argument,
conjecture, lamentation, declamation, &amp;c. which would fill pages,
not to &s;ay volumes; and to confine my&s;elf to &s;hort, authentic pieces
of intelligence, for which I may be able to afford moments and lines.
Hear then&mdash;The French Amba&s;&s;ador went off ye&s;terday morning,
not without &s;ome &s;light expre&s;&s;ions of ill-humour from John Bull.
Lord Stormont is probably arrived to-day. No <HI>immediate</HI> declaration,
except on our &s;ide. A report (but vague) of an action in the Bay,
between La Motte Piquet and Digby; the former has five &s;hips
and three frigates, with three large &s;tore-&s;hips under convoy; the
latter has eleven &s;hips of the line. If the Frenchman &s;hould &s;ail to
the mouth of the Delawar, he may po&s;&s;ibly be followed and &s;hut
up. When Franklin was received at Ver&s;ailles, Deane went in the
&s;ame character to Vienna, and Arthur Lee to Madrid. Notwith|&s;tanding
the reports of an action in Sile&s;ia, they &s;ub&s;ide; and I have
&s;een a letter from Eliot at Berlin of the tenth in&s;tant, without any
<PB N="533" REF="554">
mention of actual ho&s;tilities, and even &s;peaking of the impending
war as not ab&s;olutely inevitable. La&s;t Tue&s;day the fir&s;t payment
of the loan of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds was certainly made;
and as it would otherwi&s;e be forfeited, it is a &s;ecurity for the re|mainder.
I have not yet got the intelligence you want about former
prices of &s;tock in critical times. There are &s;urely &s;uch. <HI>Dixi.
Vale.</HI> Send me &s;ome good news from Bucks; in &s;pite of the war, I

<P>***'s Letter gave me that &s;ort of &s;atisfaction which one

pronounces your ca&s;e incurable. But no more of that. I
take up the pen, as I &s;uppo&s;e by this time you begin to &s;wear at my

D'E&s;taing's fleet has pa&s;&s;ed through the Gut (I leave you to gue&s;s

mo&s;t wonderful lethargy and oblivion, of war and peace, of Europe

attended, and Government ingeniou&s;ly contrived to &s;ecure the double

<P>I DELAYED writing, not &s;o much through indolence, as becau&s;e I
expected every po&s;t to hear from you. The &s;tate of Beriton is
uncertain, incomprehen&s;ible, tremendous. It would be endle&s;s to
&s;end you the folios of Hugonin, but I have inclo&s;ed you one of his
mo&s;t picture&s;que epi&s;tles, on which you may meditate. Few offers;
one, promi&s;ing enough, came from a gentleman at Camberwell. I
detected him, with ma&s;terly &s;kill and diligence, to be only an attorney's
Clerk, without money, credit, or experience. I have written as yet
in vain to Sir John Shelley, about Hear&s;ay; perhaps you might get

an effort of friend&s;hip worthy of The&s;eus or Perithous: modern

No news from America; yet there are people, large ones too, who
talk of conquering it next &s;ummer with the help of twenty thou&s;and

<P>THE inclo&s;ed will inform you of an event<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His appointment as Lord of Trade.</NOTE>, not the mo&s;t di&s;|agreeable
of tho&s;e which I have lately experienced. I have
only to add, that it was effected by the firm and &s;incere friend&s;hip of
the Attorney General. So many incidents have happened, that I
hardly know how to talk of news. You will learn that the Lords
have &s;trangely ca&s;trated the new Militia Bill. The Ferrol &s;quadron,
eight or nine &s;hips, have joined the French. The numbers &s;tand on
our &s;ide thirty-two, on theirs thirty-&s;even; but our force is at lea&s;t
equal, and the general con&s;ternation much di&s;pelled. If you do not
Hibernize, you might at lea&s;t Bentinckize. I embrace, &amp;c. Parliament

<SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM well and happy; two words which you will accept as the
&s;ub&s;tance of a very long letter; and even as a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for
a very long &s;ilence. Yet I really do intend to behave better; and to
prevent the abominable con&s;equence of hours and days and po&s;ts
&s;tealing away, till the &s;um total amounts to a formidable account,
I have a great mind to enter into an agreement, of &s;ending you
regularly every month, a <HI>miniature</HI> picture of my actual &s;tate and
condition on the fir&s;t day of the afore&s;aid month.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear of the very beneficial effects you have derived
from your recent friend&s;hip with the goats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Abergavenny.</NOTE>; and as I cannot di&s;|cover
in what re&s;pect this poor country is more pro&s;perous or &s;ecure
than it was la&s;t year, I mu&s;t con&s;ider your pre&s;ent confidence as a
proof that you view the pro&s;pect through a purer medium, and a
gla&s;s of a more cheerful colour. I find my&s;elf &s;o much more &s;u&s;|ceptible
of private friend&s;hip than of public &s;pirit, that I am very
well &s;atisfied with that conclu&s;ion. My &s;ummer has been pa&s;&s;ed in
the town and neighbourhood, which I &s;till maintain to be the be&s;t
&s;ociety and the be&s;t retirement; the latter, however, has been &s;ometimes
interrupted by the Colonel of Dragoons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Colonel Holroyd at that time was rai&s;ing a regiment of Light Dragoons.</NOTE> with a train of &s;erjeants,
trumpets, recruits, &amp;c. &amp;c. My own time is much and agreeably
employed in the pro&s;ecution of my bu&s;ine&s;s. After doing much
more than I expected to have done within the time, I find my&s;elf
much le&s;s advanced than I expected: yet I begin to reckon, and as
well as I can calculate, I believe, that in twelve or fourteen months I
&s;hall be brought to-bed, perhaps of twins; may they live, and prove
<PB N="544" REF="565">
as healthy as their elde&s;t brother. With regard to the little foundling
which &s;o many friends or enemies cho&s;e to lay at my door, I am
perfectly innocent, even of the knowledge of that production; and
all the faults or merits of the Hi&s;tory of Oppo&s;ition mu&s;t, as I am
informed, be imputed to Macpher&s;on, the author or tran&s;lator of
Fingal. Dear Madam, mo&s;t truly yours.</P>

<P>WHEN the Attorney General informed me of the expre&s;s he had

embracing the bolder re&s;olution. You are indeed obliged to him for
his real friend&s;hip, which he feels and expre&s;&s;es warmly; on this

find your&s;elf among us at St. Stephen's in the heat of the battle. But
you know that I am a da&s;tardly, pu&s;illanimous &s;pirit, more inclined
to fear than to hope, and not very eager in the pur&s;uit of <HI>expen&s;ive</HI>

prevent oppo&s;ition; but at the general election your enemy the

warn you again&s;t any promi&s;es or engagements which may terminate
in a defeat, or at lea&s;t a conte&s;t of ten thou&s;and pounds. Adieu.
I could believe (without &s;eeing it under her paw) that my Lady
wi&s;hes to leave Coventry. No news! foreign or dome&s;tic. I did
not forget to mention the <HI>companies,</HI> but find people, as I expected,
torpid. Burke makes his motion Friday; but I think the rumours

<P>WHEN you awakened me with your pen, it was my intention to
have &s;hewn &s;ome &s;igns of life by the next po&s;t. But &s;o un|certain
are all human affairs, that I found my&s;elf arre&s;ted by a mighty

&s;trength nor &s;pirits to u&s;e my hand in relating the melancholy tale.
At pre&s;ent, I have the plea&s;ure of informing you, that the fever and
inflammation have &s;ub&s;ided: but the ab&s;olute weakne&s;s and mon&s;trous
&s;welling of my two feet confine me to my chair and flannels; and

<P>AS a Member of Parliament, I cannot be expo&s;ed to any danger,

I am not apt, without duty or nece&s;&s;ity, to thru&s;t my&s;elf

So much for per&s;onal &s;afety; but I cannot give the &s;ame a&s;&s;urances
of public tranquillity: forty thou&s;and Puritans, &s;uch as they might
be in the time of Cromwell, have &s;tarted out of their graves; the
tumult has been dreadful; and even the remedy of military force
and martial law is unplea&s;ant. But Government, with fifteen thou&s;and
regulars in town, and every gentleman (but one) on their &s;ide, mu&s;t
extingui&s;h the flame. The execution of la&s;t night was &s;evere; per|haps
it mu&s;t be repeated to-night: yet, upon the whole, the tumult
&s;ub&s;ides. Colonel Holroyd was all la&s;t night in Holborn among the

<P>I BELIEVE we may now rejoice in our common &s;ecurity. All
tumult has perfectly &s;ub&s;ided, and we only think of the ju&s;tice

The mea&s;ures of Government have been &s;ea&s;onable and
vigorous; and even oppo&s;ition has been forced to confe&s;s, that the
military power was applied and regulated with the utmo&s;t propriety.
Our danger is at an end, but our di&s;grace will be la&s;ting, and the

fanatici&s;m, which I had &s;uppo&s;ed to be extinct, but which actually
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts in Great Britain, perhaps beyond any other country in Eu|rope.

<PB N="551" REF="572">
covered as much &s;pirit as to tell you, with what perfect &s;atisfaction I
have not only peru&s;ed, but &s;tudied, this part of your work. I knew
enough of your talents and indu&s;try to expect a great deal, but you
have gone far beyond my expectations. I can recollect no hi&s;torical
work from which I ever received &s;o much in&s;truction; and, when I
con&s;ider in what a barren field you had to glean and pick up ma|terials,
I am truly a&s;toni&s;hed at the connected and intere&s;ting &s;tory
you have formed. I like the &s;tyle of the&s;e volumes better than that
of the fir&s;t; there is the &s;ame beauty, richne&s;s, and per&s;picuity of
language, with le&s;s of that quaintne&s;s, into which your admiration of
Tacitus &s;ometimes &s;educed you. I am highly plea&s;ed with the reign of
Julian. I was a little afraid that <HI>you</HI> might lean with &s;ome partiality to|wards
him; but even bigots, I &s;hould think, mu&s;t allow, that you have
delineated his mo&s;t &s;ingular character with a more ma&s;terly hand than
ever touched it before. You &s;et me a reading his works, with which
I was very &s;lenderly acquainted; and I am much &s;truck with the
felicity wherewith you have de&s;cribed that odd infu&s;ion of Heathen
fanatici&s;m and philo&s;ophical coxcombry, which mingled with the
great qualities of a hero, and a genius. Your chapter concerning
the pa&s;toral nations is admirable; and, though I hold my&s;elf to
be a tolerably good general hi&s;torian, a great part of it was new to
me. As &s;oon as I have lei&s;ure, I purpo&s;e to trace you to your &s;ources
of information; and I have no doubt of finding you as exact there,
as I have found you in other pa&s;&s;ages where I have made a &s;crutiny.
It was always my idea that an hi&s;torian &s;hould feel him&s;elf a witne&s;s
giving evidence upon oath. I am glad to perceive by your minute
&s;crupulo&s;ity, that your notions are the &s;ame. The la&s;t chapter in
your work is the only one with which I am not entirely &s;atisfied.
I imagine you rather anticipate, in de&s;cribing the juri&s;prudence and
in&s;titutions of the Franks; and &s;hould think that the account of
private war, ordeals, chivalry, &amp;c. would have come in more in its
place about the age of Charlemagne, or later: but with re&s;pect

<P>SOON after my return I had a long conver&s;ation with our friend
Mr. Smith, in which I &s;tated to him every particular you men|tioned
to me, with re&s;pect to the propriety of going on with your
great work. I was happy to find, that his opinion coincided per|fectly
with that which I had ventured to give you. His deci&s;ions,
you know, are both prompt and vigorous; and he would not allow
that you ought to he&s;itate a moment in your choice. He promi&s;ed
to write his &s;entiments to you very fully. But as he may have ne|glected
to do this, for it is not willingly that he puts pen to paper,
I thought it might be agreeable to you to know his opinion, though I
imagine you could hardly entertain any doubt concerning it. I hope
you have brought &s;uch a &s;tock of health and &s;pirits from Bright|helm&s;tone,
that you are &s;et &s;eriou&s;ly at your de&s;k, and that in two
winters or &s;o, you will di&s;play the cre&s;cent of Mahomet on the
dome of St. Sophia. I met t'other day, in a work addre&s;&s;ed to
your&s;elf, a &s;en&s;ible pa&s;&s;age from F. Paul, which perfectly removes
one of your chief difficulties, as to the barrenne&s;s of &s;ome parts of
your period. Hayley's E&s;&s;ay on Hi&s;tory, p. 133. By the bye,
who is this Mr. Hayley? His poetry has more merit than that of
mo&s;t of his contemporaries; but his whiggi&s;m is &s;o bigotted, and
his Chri&s;tianity &s;o &s;ierce, that he almo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ts one with two very
good things.</P>

<P>I RETURNED to this place with Lord and Lady Sheffield, with the
de&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ing two or three weeks in a &s;ituation which had
&s;o highly delighted me. But how vain are all &s;ublunary hopes! I
had forgot that there is &s;ome difference between the &s;un&s;hine of
Augu&s;t and the cold fogs (though we have uncommon good weather)
of November. In&s;tead of my beautiful &s;ea-&s;hore, I am confined to
a dark lodging in the middle of the town; for the place is &s;till full,
and our time is now &s;pent in the dull imitation of a London life.
To complete my misfortunes, Lord Sheffield was ha&s;tily ordered to
Canterbury and Deal, to &s;uppre&s;s &s;ome di&s;turbances, and I was left
almo&s;t alone with my Lady, in the &s;ervile &s;tate of a married man.
But he returns to-day, and I hope to be &s;eated in my own library
by the middle of next week. However, you will not be &s;orry to
hear that I have refre&s;hed my&s;elf by a very <HI>idle</HI> &s;ummer, and indeed
a much idler and more plea&s;ant winter than the Hou&s;e of Commons
will ever allow me to enjoy again. I had almo&s;t forgot Mr. Hayley;
ungratefully enough, &s;ince I really pa&s;&s;ed a very &s;imple, but enter|taining
day with him. His place, though &s;mall, is elegant as his
mind, which I value much more highly. Mrs. ** wrote a
melancholy &s;tory of an American mother, a friend of her friend,
who in a &s;hort time had lo&s;t three &s;ons; one killed by the &s;avages,

to me, that it might not be ami&s;s to enclo&s;e the two e&s;&s;ential lines, if
I only added that the influenza has been known to me only by the re|port

in the Cabinet are &s;u&s;pected. If Lord Shelburne &s;hould be the
man, as I think he will, the friends of his predece&s;&s;or will quarrel
with him before Chri&s;tmas. At all events, I fore&s;ee much tumult
and &s;trong oppo&s;ition, from which I &s;hould be very glad to extricate
my&s;elf, by quitting the Hou&s;e of Commons with honour. What|ever
you may hear, I believe there is not the lea&s;t intention of di&s;|&s;olving
Parliament, which would indeed be a ra&s;h and dangerous
mea&s;ure. I hope you like Mr. Hayley's poem; he ri&s;es with his

under the veil of Hampton Court I may lurk ten days or a fortnight
at Sheffield, if the enraged Lady does not &s;hut the doors again&s;t me.
The Warden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed through in his way to Dover. He is not &s;o

may &s;afely exult in my &s;ilence and your own victory. The
difference between us, (on the credibility of miracles,) which you
chu&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e, and wi&s;h to argue, is a trite and antient topic
of controver&s;y, and, from the opinion which you entertain of your|&s;elf

either edify or enlighten the Public.</P>

a friend to it: a conduct which I &s;cruple not to call highly unworthy
and mean; and in&s;ult on the common &s;en&s;e of the Chri&s;tian world;
as a method of &s;creening you from the notice of the law, (which is
as ho&s;tile to me as it is to you,) you mu&s;t know that it could avail
you nothing; and, though that mode of writing might be deemed
ingenious and witty in the fir&s;t inventor of it, it has been too often
repeated to de&s;erve that appellation now.</P>
<P>According to your own rule of conduct, this charge ought to pro|voke
you to de&s;cend into the amphitheatre once more, as much as
the accu&s;ation of Mr. Davis: for it is a call upon you to defend, not
your <HI>principles</HI> only, but al&s;o your <HI>honour.</HI> For what can reflect
greater di&s;honour on a man, than to &s;ay one thing and mean another?
You have certainly been very far from con&s;ining your&s;elf, as you
pretend, to a &s;imple narrative of authentic facts, without interpo&s;ing
your own &s;entiments. I hold no opinions, obnoxious as they are,
that I am not ready both to <HI>avow</HI> in the mo&s;t explicit manner, and
al&s;o to defend with any per&s;on of competent judgment and ability.
Had I not con&s;idered you in this light, and al&s;o as fairly open, by
the &s;train of your writings, to &s;uch a challenge, I &s;hould not have
called upon you as I have done. The Public will form its own
judgment both of that and of your &s;ilence on the occa&s;ion; and
finally decide between you, the <HI>humble hi&s;torian,</HI> and me, the <HI>proud
di&s;putant.</HI></P>
<P>As to my <HI>reputation,</HI> for which you are &s;o very obligingly con|cerned,
give me leave to ob&s;erve, that, as far as it is an object with
any per&s;on, and a thing to be enjoyed by him&s;elf, it mu&s;t depend
upon his particular notions and feelings.&mdash;Now, odd as it will appear to
<PB N="567" REF="588">
you, the e&s;teem of a very few rational Chri&s;tian friends (though I know
that it will en&s;ure me the dete&s;tation of the greater part of the pre&s;ent
nominally Chri&s;tian world that happen to hear me) given me more
real &s;atisfaction, than the applau&s;e of what you call the philo&s;ophic
world. I admire Servetus, by who&s;e example you wi&s;h me to take
warning, more for his courage in dying for the cau&s;e of important
truth, than I &s;hould have done if, be&s;ides the certain di&s;covery of
the circulation of the blood, he had made any other the mo&s;t cele|brated
di&s;covery in philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>However, I do not &s;ee what my philo&s;ophical friends (of whom
I have many, and whom I think I value as I ought,) have to do with
my metaphy&s;ical or theological writings. They may, if they plea&s;e,
con&s;ider them as my particular whims or amu&s;ements, and accord|ingly
neglect them. They have, in fact, interfered very little with
my application to philo&s;ophy, &s;ince I have had the means of doing
it. I was never more bu&s;y, or more &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;o, in my philo&s;ophi|cal
pur&s;uits, than during the time that I have been employed about
the Hi&s;tory of the Corruptions of Chri&s;tianity. I am at this very
time, <HI>totus in illis,</HI> as my friends know; and as the Public will
know in due time; which with me is never long, and if you had
thought proper to enter into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion I propo&s;ed, it would not
have made me neglect my laboratory, or omit a &s;ingle experiment
that I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have made.</P>

<P>I NEITHER reque&s;ted nor wi&s;hed to have any <HI>private corre&s;pondence</HI>

<P>IF Dr. Prie&s;tley con&s;ults his friends, he will probably learn, that a

Dr. Prie&s;tley or him&s;elf with explaining the motives of his refu&s;al.</P>

<P>DR. Prie&s;tley is as unwilling to be guilty of any real impropriety
as Mr. Gibbon can wi&s;h him to be: but, as the corre&s;pondence
between them relates not to any <HI>private,</HI> but only to a <HI>public matter,</HI>
he apprehends that it may, according to Mr. Gibbon's own di&s;tinction,
at the plea&s;ure of either of the parties be laid before the Public; who,
in fact, are intere&s;ted to know, at lea&s;t, the re&s;ult of it. Dr. Prie&s;tley's
<PB N="570" REF="591">
conduct will always be open to animadver&s;ion, that of Mr. Gibbon,
or of any other per&s;on. His appeal is to men of honour, and even
men of the world; and he de&s;ires no favour.</P>
<P>Dr. Prie&s;tley has &s;ent a &s;ingle copy of the corre&s;pondence to a
friend in London, with leave to &s;hew it to any other common friends,
but with a prohibition to take any other copy: but between this and
<HI>printing</HI> there is no difference, except in <HI>mode</HI> and <HI>extent.</HI> In the
eye of the law and of rea&s;on both are equally publications; and has
Mr. Gibbon never thought him&s;elf at liberty to &s;hew a copy of a
letter to a third per&s;on?</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon may ea&s;ily e&s;cape all further altercation by di&s;con|tinuing
this mutually di&s;agreeable corre&s;pondence, by leaving Dr.
Prie&s;tley to act as his own di&s;cretion or indi&s;cretion may dictate;
and for this, him&s;elf only, and not Mr. Gibbon, is re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>

<P>QUE j'aime la douce et parfaite confiance de nos &s;entimens r&eacute;ci|proques!
Nous nous aimons dans l'&eacute;loignement et le &s;ilence, et
il nous &s;uffit &agrave; l'un et &agrave; l'autre, de &s;avoir de tems en tems, des nou|velles
de la &s;ant&eacute; et du bonheur de &s;on ami. Aujourd'hui j'ai be&s;oin
de vous &eacute;crire' je commence &s;ans excu&s;es et &s;ans reproches, comme
&s;i nous allions reprendre la conver&s;ation famili&egrave;re du jour pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent.
Si je propo&s;ois de faire un <HI>compte rendu</HI> de mes &eacute;tudes, de mes occu|pations,
de mes plai&s;irs, de mes nouvelles liai&s;ons, de ma politique
toujours muette, mais un peu plus rapproch&eacute;e des grands &eacute;venemens,
je multiplierois mes <HI>in quarto,</HI> et je ne &s;ais pas encore votre avis &s;ur
ceux que je vous ai dej&agrave; envoy&eacute;s. Dans cette hi&s;toire moderne, il
<PB N="571" REF="592">
&s;eroit toujours que&s;tion de la d&eacute;cadence des empires; et autant que
j'en puis juger &s;ur mes r&eacute;mini&s;cences et &s;ur le rapport de l'ami
Bugnon, vous aimez au&s;&s;i peu la pui&s;&s;ance de l'Angleterre que celle
des Romains. Notre chute, cependant, a &eacute;t&eacute; plus douce. Apres une
guerre &s;ans &s;ucc&egrave;s, et une paix a&s;&s;ez peu glorieu&s;e, il nous re&s;te de
quoi vivre contens et heureux; et lor&s;que je me &s;uis d&eacute;pouill&eacute; du
r&ocirc;le de Membre du Parlement, pour redevenir homme, philo&s;ophe,
et hi&s;torien, nous pourrions bien nous trouver d'accord &s;ur la plus part
des &s;c&ecirc;nes &eacute;tonnantes qui viennent de &s;e pa&s;&s;er devant nos yeux, et
qui fourniront une riche mati&egrave;re aux plus habiles de mes &s;uc|ce&s;&s;eurs.</P>
<P>Bornons nous &agrave; cette heure &agrave; un objet moins illu&s;tre &s;ans doute,
mais plus int&eacute;re&s;&s;ant pour tous les deux, et c'e&s;t beaucoup que le
m&ecirc;me objet pui&s;&s;e int&eacute;re&s;&s;er deux mortels qui ne &s;e &s;ont pas v&ucirc;s, qui
a peine &s;e &s;ont &eacute;crit depuis&mdash;oui ma foi&mdash;depuis huit ans. Ma
plume, tr&egrave;s pare&s;&s;eu&s;e au commencement, ou plut&ocirc;t avant le com|mencement,
marche a&s;&s;ez vite, lor&s;qu'elle s'e&s;t une fois mi&s;e en train;
mais une rai&s;on qui m'emp&ecirc;cheroit de lui donner carri&egrave;re, c'e&s;t l'e&s;|p&eacute;rance
de pouvoir bient&ocirc;t me &s;ervir avec vous d'un in&s;trument
encore plus commode, la langue. Que l'homme, l'homme Anglois,
l'homme Gibbon, e&s;t un &s;ot animal! Je l'e&s;pere, je le de&s;ire, je le

qui me paro&icirc;&s;&s;ent tres ob&s;cures, et tres &eacute;quivoques; et vous
aurez la bont&eacute; de m'apprendre qu'elle &s;era ma conduite future. Il
vous &s;ouvient, Seigneur, que mon grand pere a fait &s;a fortune, que
mon pere l'a mang&eacute;e avec un peu trop d'app&eacute;tit, et que je jouis
actuellement du fruit, ou plut&ecirc;t du re&s;te de leurs travaux. Vous
n'avez pas oubli&eacute; que je &s;uis entr&eacute; au Parlement &s;ans patrioti&s;me,
&s;ans ambition, et que toutes mes vues &s;e bornoient &agrave; la place com|mode
et honn&ecirc;te d'un <HI>Lord of Trade.</HI> Cette place, je l'ai obtenue
<PB N="572" REF="593">
enfin; je l'ai po&s;&s;&eacute;d&eacute;e trois ans, depuis 1779 ju&s;qu' &agrave; 1782, et le
produit net, qui &s;e montoit &agrave; &s;ept cens cinquante livres &s;terling, aug|mentoit
mon revenu, au niveau de mes be&s;oins, et de mes de&s;irs.
Mais au printems de l'ann&eacute;e pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente, l'orage a grond&eacute; &s;ur nos
t&ecirc;tes: Milord North a &eacute;t&eacute; renver&s;&eacute;, votre &s;erviteur cha&s;&s;&eacute;, et le

r&eacute;formation de M. Burke, avec beaucoup d'autres places de l'Etat, et
de la mai&s;on du Roi. Pour mon malheur, je &s;uis toujours re&s;t&eacute;
Membre de la Chambre ba&s;&s;e: &agrave; la fin du dernier Parlement (en
1780) M. Eliot &agrave; retir&eacute; &s;a nomination; mais la faveur de Milord
North a facilit&eacute; ma rentr&eacute;e, et la reconnoi&s;ance m'impo&s;oit le devoir
de faire valoir, pour &s;on &s;ervice, les droits que je tenois en partie
de lui. Cet hyver nous avons combatu &s;ous les &eacute;tendards r&eacute;unis
(vous &s;avez notre hi&s;toire) de Milord North, et de M. Fox; nous
avons triomph&eacute; de Milord Shelburne et de la paix, et mon ami (je
n'aime pas &agrave; profaner ce nom) a remont&eacute; &s;ur &s;a b&ecirc;te en qualit&eacute; de
Secretaire d'Etat. C'e&s;t &agrave; pr&eacute;&s;ent qu'il peut bien me dire: <Q>C'&eacute;toit
beaucoup pour moi; ce n'&eacute;toit rien pour vous;</Q> et malgr&eacute; les a&s;|&s;urances
les plus fortes, j'ai trop de rai&s;on, pour avoir de la foi.
Avec beaucoup d'e&s;prit, et des qualit&eacute;s tr&egrave;s re&s;pectables, il n'a plus ni le

r&eacute;volution, qui me fera perdre dans un in&s;tant, ce qui m'aura co&ucirc;t&eacute;
tant de &s;oins et de recherches. Si je ne con&s;ultois que mon coeur

d&eacute;pendance; je quitterois le Parlement, Londres, l'Angleterre; je
chercherois &s;ous un ciel plus doux, dans un pays plus tranquille, le
repos, la libert&eacute;, l' ai&s;ance, et une &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;clair&eacute;e et aimable. Je coule|rois
quelques ann&eacute;es de ma vie &s;ans e&s;p&eacute;rance, et &s;ans crainte,
<PB N="573" REF="594">
j'acheverois mon hi&s;toire, et je ne rentrerois dans ma patrie qu'en
homme libre, riche, et re&s;pectable par &s;a po&s;ition, au&s;&s;i bien que
par &s;on caract&egrave;re. Mes amis, et &s;urtout Milord Sheffield, ne
veulent pas me permettre d'&ecirc;tre heureux &s;uivant mon go&ucirc;t et mes
lumi&egrave;res. Leur prudence exige que je fa&s;&s;e tous mes efforts, pour
obtenir un emploi tr&egrave;s &s;ur &agrave; la v&eacute;rit&eacute;, qui me donneroit mille guin&eacute;es

pr&ecirc;te &agrave; leur zele, et je leur ai promis de ne partir qu'en automne,
apr&egrave;s avoir con&s;acr&eacute; l'&eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; cette derni&egrave;re tentative. Le &s;ucc&egrave;s, cepen|dant,
e&s;t tr&egrave;s incertain, et je ne &s;ais &s;i je le de&s;ire de bonne foi.</P>
<P>Si je parviens &agrave; me voir exil&eacute;, mon choix ne &s;era pas douteux
Lau&s;anne a eu mes pr&eacute;mices; elle me &s;era toujours chere par le doux
&s;ouvenir de ma jeune&s;&s;e. Au bout de trente ans, je me rappelle les
poli&s;&s;ons qui &s;ont aujourd'hui juges, les petites &s;illes de la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute; du
printems, qui &s;ont devenues grand-meres. Votre pays e&s;t charmant,
et, malgr&eacute; le d&eacute;go&ucirc;t de Jean Jacques, les moeurs, et l'e&s;prit de &s;es
habitants, me paroi&s;&s;ent tr&egrave;s a&s;&s;ortis aux bords du lac L&eacute;man. Mais
un tr&eacute;&s;or que je ne trouverois qu'&agrave; Lau&s;anne; c'e&s;t un ami qui me
convient &eacute;galement par les &s;entimens, et les id&eacute;es, avec qui je n'ai
jamais connu un in&s;tant d'ennui, de &s;&eacute;chere&s;&s;e, ou de r&eacute;&s;erve. Au|trefois
dans nos libres &eacute;panchemens, nous avons cent fois fait le
projet de vivre en&s;emble, et cent fois nous avons &eacute;pluch&eacute; tous les
d&eacute;tails du Roman, avec une chaleur qui nous &eacute;tonnoit nous memes.
A pr&eacute;&s;ent il demeure, ou plut&ocirc;t vous demeurez, (car je me la&s;&s;e de ce
ton &eacute;tudi&eacute;,) dans une mai&s;on charmante et commode; je vois d'ici mon
appartement, nos &s;alles communes, notre table, et nos promenades;
mais ce mariage ne vaut rien, s'il ne convient pas &eacute;galement aux
deux &eacute;poux, et je &s;ens combien des circon&s;tances locales, des go&ucirc;ts
nouveaux, de nouvelles liai&s;ons, peuvent s'oppo&s;er aux de&s;&s;eins, qui
nous ont paru les plus agr&eacute;ables dans le lointain. Pour fixer mes
id&eacute;es, et pour nous &eacute;pargner des regrets, il faut me d&eacute;voiler avec
la franchi&s;e dont je vous ai donn&eacute; l'exemple, le tableau ext&eacute;rieur et
int&eacute;rieur de George Deyverdun. Mon amour e&s;t trop d&eacute;licat, pour
<PB N="574" REF="595">
&s;upporter l'indiff&eacute;rence et les &eacute;gards, et je rougirois d'un bonheur
dont je &s;erois redevable, non &agrave; l'inclination, mais &agrave; la fid&eacute;lit&eacute; de mon
ami. Pour m'armer contre les malheurs po&s;&s;ibles, helas! peut &egrave;tre

projet favori, et de me repr&eacute;&s;enter &agrave; Lau&s;anne votre bon voi&s;in, &s;ans
&ecirc;tre pr&eacute;ci&s;ement votre commen&s;al. Si j'y &eacute;tois r&eacute;duit, je ne voudrois
pas tenir mai&s;on, autant par rai&s;on d'&eacute;conomie, que pour &eacute;viter l'en|nui
de manger &s;eul. D'un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, une pen&s;ion ouverte, fut elle
mont&eacute;e &s;ur l'ancien pied de celle de Me&s;ery, ne conviendroit plus
&agrave; mon age, ni &agrave; mon caract&egrave;re? Pa&s;&s;erois je ma vie au milieu
d'une foule de jeunes Anglois &eacute;chapp&eacute;s du college, moi qui aimerois
Lau&s;anne cent fois davantage, &s;i j'y pouvois &egrave;tre le &s;eul de ma
nation? Il me faudroit donc une mai&s;on commode et riante, un
&eacute;tat au de&s;&s;us de la bourgeoi&s;ie, un mari in&s;truit, une femme qui ne
re&s;embleroit pas &agrave; Madame Pavilliard; et l'a&s;&s;urance d'y &ecirc;tre re&ccedil;u
comme le fils unique, ou plut&ocirc;t comme le frere de la famille. Pour
nous arranger &s;ans g&ecirc;ne, je meublerai tr&egrave;s volontiers un joli apparte|ment
&s;ous le m&ecirc;me toit, ou dans le voi&s;inage, et pui&s;que le m&eacute;nage
le plus foible, lai&s;&s;e encore de l'&eacute;toffe pour une forte pen&s;ion, je ne
&s;erois pas oblig&eacute; de chicaner &s;ur les conditions p&eacute;cuniaires. Si je
me vois d&eacute;chu de cette derni&eacute;re e&s;p&eacute;rance, je renoncerois en &s;oupi|rant

lac de Neufchatel, parmi les bons Savoyards de Chamberry, ou &s;ous
le beau climat des Provinces M&eacute;ridionales de la France. Je finis
bru&s;quement, parceque j'ai mille cho&s;es &agrave; vous dire. Je pen&s;e que
nous nous re&s;&s;emblons pour la corre&s;pondance. Pour le bavardage
&s;avant, ou m&ecirc;me amical, je &s;uis de tous les hommes le plus pare&s;|&s;eux,
mais des qu'il s'agit d'un objet r&eacute;el, d'un &s;ervice e&s;&s;entiel, le
premier Courier emporte toujours ma r&eacute;pon&s;e. A la &s;in d'un mois,

et incertain, que je l'&eacute;tais il y a quelques ann&eacute;es, ne &s;achant quelle
nouvelle &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute; choi&s;ir, et a&s;&s;ez di&s;po&s;&eacute; &agrave; vendre enfin cette po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
qui m'a cau&s;&eacute; bien des plai&s;irs, et bien des peines. Ma
mai&s;on e&s;t donc &agrave; votre di&s;po&s;ition pour cet automne, et vous y

arriveriez comme un Dieu dans une machine qui finit l'embroglio
Voil&agrave; quant &agrave; moi; parlons de vous maintenant avec la m&ecirc;me &s;in|c&eacute;rit&eacute;.</P>
<P>Un mot de pr&eacute;ambule. Qulque int&eacute;re&s;&s;&eacute; que je &s;ois &agrave; votre
r&eacute;&s;olution, convaincu qu'il faut aimer &s;es amis pour eux m&ecirc;mes,
&s;entant d'ailleurs combien il &s;eroit affreux pour moi de vous voir des
regrets, je vous donne ici ma parole d'honneur, que mon int&eacute;r&ecirc;t n'in|flue
en rien &s;ur ce que je vais &eacute;crire, et que je ne dirai pas un mot
que je ne vous di&s;&s;e, &s;i l'hermite de la grotte etoit un autre que moi.
Vos amis Anglais vous aiment pour eux m&ecirc;mes: je ne veux moi
que votre bonheur. Rappellez vous, mon cher ami, que je vis
avec peine votre entr&eacute;e dans le Parlement, et je crois n'avoir &eacute;t&eacute; que
trop bon prophete; je &s;uis &s;ur que cette carri&egrave;re vous a fait &eacute;prouver
plus de privations que de joui&s;&s;ances, beaucoup plus de peines que
de plai&s;irs; j'ai cru toujours, depuis que je vous ai connu, que vous
&eacute;tiez de&s;tin&eacute; &agrave; vivre heureux par les plai&s;irs du cabinet et de la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;,
que tout autre marche &eacute;tait un &eacute;cart de la route du bonheur, et que
ce n'etait que les qualit&eacute;s r&eacute;unies d'homme de lettres, et d'homme
aimable de &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;, qui pouvoient vous procurer gloire, honneur,
plai&s;irs, et un &s;uite continuelle de joui&s;&s;ances. Au bout de quelques
tours dans votre &s;alle, vous &s;entirez parfaitement que j'avois bien vu,
et que l'&eacute;venement a ju&s;tifi&eacute; mes id&eacute;es. Lor&s;que j'ai appris que vous
&eacute;tiez <HI>Lord of Trade,</HI> j'en ai &eacute;t&eacute; fach&eacute;; quand j'ai &s;u que vous aviez
perdu cette place, je m'en &s;uis r&eacute;jouis pour vous; quand on m'a
anonc&eacute; que Milord North &eacute;toit remont&eacute; &s;ur &s;a b&ecirc;te, j'ai cru vous
voir tr&egrave;s mal &agrave; votre ai&s;e, en croupe derri&egrave;re lui, et je m'en &s;uis af|flig&eacute;
pour vous. Je &s;uis donc charm&eacute;, mon cher ami, de vous &s;avoir
&agrave; pied, et je vous con&s;eille tr&egrave;s &s;inc&egrave;rement de re&s;ter dans cette po&s;i|tion,
et bien loin de &s;olliciter la place en que&s;tion, de la refu&s;er, &s;i elle
vous &eacute;tait offerte. Mille guin&eacute;es vous d&eacute;dommageront elles de cinq
jours pris de la &s;emaine? Je &s;uppo&s;e, ce que cependant j'ai peine &agrave;
<PB N="577" REF="598">
croire, que vous me di&s;iez que oui: et la vari&eacute;t&eacute; et l'incon&s;tance con|tinuelle
de votre mini&s;t&egrave;re, vous promettent elles d'en jouir long tems
con&s;tamment, et n'e&s;t il pas plus d&eacute;&s;agr&eacute;able, mon cher Mon&s;ieur, de
n'avoir plus 1000 livres &s;terl. de rente, qu'il n'a &eacute;t&eacute; agr&eacute;able d'en
jouir? D'ailleurs ne pourrez vous pas toujours rentrer dans la car|ri&egrave;re,
&s;i l'ambition ou l'envie de &s;ervir la patrie, vous reprennent; ne
rentrerez vous pas avec plus d'honneur, lor&s;que vos rentes &eacute;tant aug|ment&eacute;es
naturellement, vous &s;erez libre et ind&eacute;pendant?</P>
<P>En fai&s;ant cette retraite en Sui&s;&s;e, outre la beaut&eacute; du pays, et les
agr&eacute;mens de la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;, vous acquererez deux biens que vous avez
perdus, la libert&eacute; et la riche&s;&s;e. Vous ne &s;erez d'ailleurs point
inutile; vos ouvrages continueront &agrave; nous &eacute;clairer, et independam|ment
de vos talens, l'honn&ecirc;te homme, le galant homme, n'e&s;t jamais
inutile.</P>
<P>Il me re&s;te &agrave; vous pr&eacute;&s;ente le tableau que vous trouveriez. Vous
aimiez ma mai&s;on et mon jardin, c'e&s;t bien autre cho&s;e &agrave; pr&eacute;&s;ent.
Au premier &eacute;tage qui donne &s;ur la de&s;cente d'Ouchy, je me &s;uis ar|rang&eacute;
un appartement qui me &s;uffit, j'ai une chambre de dome&s;tique,
deux &s;allons, et deux cabinets. J'ai au plein pied de la terra&s;&s;e,
deux autres &s;allons dont l'un &s;ert en &eacute;t&eacute; de &s;alle &agrave; manger, et l'autre
de &s;allon de compagnie. J'ai fait un nouvel appartement de trois
pi&egrave;ces dans le vuide entre la mai&s;on et la remi&s;e, en &s;orte que j'ai &agrave;
vous offrir tout le grand appartement, qui con&s;i&s;te actuellement en
onze pi&egrave;ces, tant grandes que petites, tourn&eacute;es au Levant et au Midi,
meubl&eacute;es &s;ans magnificence d&eacute;plac&eacute;e, mais avec une &s;orte d'&eacute;l&eacute;gance
dont j'e&s;p&egrave;re que vous &s;eriez &s;atisfait. La terra&s;&s;e a peu chang&eacute;;
mais elle e&s;t termin&eacute;e par un grand cabinet mieux proportionn&eacute; que le
pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent, garnie tout du long, de cai&s;&s;es d'orangers, &amp;c. La treille,
qui ne vous e&s;t pas indiff&eacute;rente, a embelli, pro&s;p&eacute;r&eacute;, et regne pre&s;|qu'enti&egrave;rement
ju&s;qu'au bout; parvenu &agrave; ce bout, vous trouverez un
petit chemin qui vous conduira &agrave; une chaumi&egrave;re plac&eacute;e dans un coin;
et de ce coin, en &s;uivant le long d'une autre route &agrave; l'Anglai&s;e, le
<PB N="578" REF="599">
mur d'un man&eacute;ge. Vous trouverez au bout, un chalet avec &eacute;curie,
vacherie, petite porte, petit cabinet, petite biblioth&egrave;que, et une galerie
de bois dor&eacute;, d'o&ugrave; l'on voit tout ce qui &s;ort et entre en ville par la porte
du Ch&ecirc;ne, et tout ce qui &s;e pa&s;&s;e dans ce Faubourg. J'ai acquis la
vigne au-de&s;&s;ous du jardin; j'en ai arrach&eacute; tout ce qui &eacute;toit devant
la mai&s;on; j'en ai fait un tapis vert, arro&s;&eacute; par l'eau du jet d'eau; et
j'ai fait tout autour de ce petit parc, une promenade tr&egrave;s vari&eacute;e par
les diff&eacute;rens points de vue et les objets m&ecirc;me int&eacute;rieurs, tantot
jardin potager, tantot parterre, tantot vigne, tantot pr&egrave;s, puis chalet,
chaumiere, petite montagne; bref, les &eacute;trangers viennent le voir et
l'admirent, et malgr&eacute; la de&s;cription pompeu&s;e que je vou en fais,
vous en &s;erez content.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> J'ai plant&eacute; une quantit&eacute; d'excellens arbres fruitiers.</P>
<P>Venons &agrave; moi; vous comprenez bien que j'ai vieilli, except&eacute; pour
la &s;en&s;ibilit&eacute;; je &s;uis &agrave; la mode, mes nerfs &s;ont attaqu&eacute;s; je &s;uis plus
m&eacute;lancolique, mais je n'ai pas plus d'humeur; vous ne &s;ouffrirez
de mes maux que tout au plus n&eacute;gativement. En&s;emble, et &s;&eacute;par&eacute;s
par nos logemens, nous jouirons vis-&agrave;-vis l'un de l'autre, de la plus
grande libert&eacute;. Nous prendrons une gouvernante douce et entendue,
plut&ocirc;t par commodit&egrave; que par n&eacute;ce&s;&s;it&eacute;; car je me chargerois &s;ans
crainte de la &s;urintendance. J'ai fait un m&eacute;nage de quatre, pen|dant
quelque tems; j'ai fait le mien, et j'ai remarqu&eacute; que cela mar|choit
tout &s;eul, quand c'&eacute;toit une fois en train. Les petites gens qui
n'ont que ce m&eacute;rite, font grand bruit pour rien. Mon jardin nous
fournira avec abondance de bons fruits et d'excellens l&eacute;gumes.
Pour la re&s;te de la table et de la d&eacute;pen&s;e dome&s;tique, je ne demanderais
pas mieux que de vous re&ccedil;evoir chez moi, comme vous m'avez re&ccedil;u
chez vous; mais nos &s;ituations &s;ont diff&eacute;rentes &agrave; cet egard; cepen|dant
&s;i vous etiez plus ruin&eacute;, je vous l'offrirois &s;ans doute, et je
devrois le faire; mais avec les rentes que vous aviez, quand j'&eacute;tois
chez vous, en les &s;uppo&s;ant m&ecirc;me diminu&eacute;es, vous vivrez tr&egrave;s agr&eacute;|ablement
<PB N="579" REF="600">
ablement &agrave; Lau&s;anne. Enfin &agrave; cet &eacute;gard nous nous arrangerons,
comme il vous &s;era le plus agr&eacute;able, et en proportion de nos revenus.
Toujours &s;erez vous ain&s;i, &agrave; ce qui j'e&s;p&egrave;re, plus d&eacute;cemment et plus
comfortablement, que vous ne &s;eriez par tout ailleurs au m&ecirc;me prix.</P>
<P>Quant &agrave; la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;, quoique infiniment agr&eacute;able, je commence ce
chapitre par vous dire que j'&eacute;viterois de vous y inviter, &s;i vous &eacute;tiez
enti&egrave;rement d&eacute;&s;oeuvr&eacute;; les jours &s;ont longs alors, et lai&s;&s;ent bien
du vuide; mais homme de lettres, comme vous &ecirc;tes, je ne connois
point de &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute; qui vous convienne mieux. Nous aurona autour de
nous un cercle, comme il &s;eroit impo&s;&s;ible d'en trouver ailleurs dans
un au&s;&s;i petit e&s;pace. Madame de Corcelles, Mademoi&s;elle Sulens, et
M. de Montolieu (Madame e&s;t morte), Me&s;&s;rs. Polier et leurs fem|mes,
Madame de Severy, et M. et Madame de Na&s;&s;au, Mademoi&s;elle
de Chandieu, Madame de St. Cierge, et M. avec leurs deux filles
jolies et aimables, Madames de Crou&s;az, Polier, de Charrieres, &amp;c.
font un fonds de bonne compagnie dont on ne &s;e la&s;&s;e point, et dont
M. de Servan e&s;t &s;i content qu'il regrette toujours d'&ecirc;tre oblig&eacute; de re|tourner
dans &s;es terres, et ne re&s;pire que pour s'&eacute;tablir tout &agrave; fait &agrave;
Lau&s;anne. Il pa&s;&s;a tout l'hyver de 1782 avec nous, et il fut, on ne
peut plus, agr&eacute;able. Vous trouverez les moeurs chang&eacute;es en bien,
et plus conformes &agrave; nos ages, et &agrave; nos caract&egrave;res; peu de grandes
a&s;&s;embl&eacute;es, de grands repas, mais beaucoup de petits &s;oupers, de
petites a&s;&s;embl&eacute;es, o&ugrave; l'on fait ce qu' on veut, o&ugrave; l'on cau&s;e, lit, &amp;c.
ct dont on &eacute;carte avec &s;oin les facheux de toute e&s;pece. Il y le
Dimanche un &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;, o&ugrave; tout ce qu'il y a d'un peu di&s;tingu&eacute; en
&eacute;trang&egrave;res et &eacute;trangers, e&s;t invit&eacute;. Cela fait des a&s;&s;embl&eacute;es de 40 &agrave; 50
per&s;onnes, o&ugrave; l'on voit ce qu'on ne voit gueres le re&s;te de la &s;emaine,
et ces e&s;peces de <HI>rout</HI> font quelquefois plai&s;ir. Nous &s;ommes fort
d&eacute;gout&eacute;s des &eacute;trangers, &s;urtout des jeunes gens, et nous les &eacute;cartons
avec &s;oin de nos petits comit&eacute;s, &agrave; moins qu'ils n'ayent du m&eacute;rite, ou
quelques talens. A cet &eacute;gard un de nos petits travers, c'e&s;t l'en|gouement;
mais vous en profiterez, mon cher Mon&s;ieur, comme
<PB N="580" REF="601">
Edward Gibbon, et comme mon ami; vous ferez d'abord l'homme &agrave;
la mode, et je vois d'ici que vous &s;outiendrez fort bien ce r&ocirc;le, &s;ans
vous en f&agrave;cher, d&ucirc;t on un peu vous &s;urfaire. <HI>Je &s;ens que tu me
flattes, mais tu me fais plai&s;ir,</HI> e&s;t peut &ecirc;tre le meilleur vers de De&s;|touches.
Voil&agrave; donc l'hyver; l'&eacute;tude le matin, quelques conver&s;a|tions,
quand vous &s;erez fatigu&eacute;, avec quelque homme de lettres, ou
amateur, ou du moins qui aura vu quelque cho&s;e; &agrave; l'heure qu'il
vous plaira un diner, point de &s;ermier g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, mais l'honn&ecirc;te &eacute;pi|curien,
avec un ou deux amis quand vous voudrez; puis quelques
vi&s;ites, une &s;oir&eacute;e, &s;ouvent un &s;ouper. Quant &agrave; l'&eacute;t&eacute;, vu votre mani&egrave;re
d'aimer la campagne, on diroit que ma remi&s;e a &eacute;t&eacute; faite pour vous;
pendant que vous vous y promenerez en &s;&eacute;nateur, je &s;erai &s;ouvent en
bon pay&s;an Sui&s;&s;e, devant mon chalet, ou dans ma chaumi&egrave;re; puis
nous nous rencontrerons tout &agrave; coup, et t&acirc;cherons de nous remettre
au niveau l'un de l'autre. Nous fermerons nos portes &agrave; l'ordinaire,
except&eacute; aux &eacute;trangers qui pa&s;&s;ent leur chemin; mais quand nous
voudrons, nous y aurons tous ceux que nous aimerons &agrave; y voir:
car on ne demande pas mieux que d'y venir &s;e rejouir. J'ai eu, un
beau jour d'Avril ce printems, un d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner, qui m'a co&ucirc;t&eacute; quelques
Louis, ou il y avait plus de 40 per&s;onnes, je ne &s;ais combien de
petites tables, une bonne mu&s;ique au milieu du verger, et une quan|tit&eacute;
de jeunes et jolies per&s;onnes dan&s;ant des branles, et formant des
chifres en cadence; j'ai vu bien des f&egrave;tes, j'en ai peu vu de plus
jolies. Quand mon pare vous ennuyera, nous aurous, ou nous
louerons en&s;emble (et ce &s;era ain&s;i un plai&s;ir peu cher) un cabriolet
l&eacute;ger, avec deux chevaux gentils, et nous irons vi&s;iter nos amis
di&s;per&s;&eacute;s dans les campagnes, qui nous recevront &agrave; bras ouverts. Vous
en &s;erez content de nos campagnes; toujours en proportion vous
comprenez, et vous trouverez en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral un heureux changement
pour les agr&eacute;mens de la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;, et une &s;orte de recherche &s;imple,
mas &eacute;l&eacute;gante. Les berg&egrave;res du <HI>printems,</HI> except&eacute; Madame de Van|berg,
ne &s;ont &s;ans doute plus pr&eacute;&s;entables, mais il y en a d'autres a&s;&s;ez
<PB N="581" REF="602">
gentilles, et quoiqu'elles ne &s;oyent pas en bien grand nombre, il y
en aura toujours a&s;&s;ez pour vous, mon cher Mon&s;ieur. Peu &agrave; peu
mon imagination m'a emport&eacute;, et mon &s;tyle s'&eacute;gaye, comme cela
nous arrivait quelquefois dans nos chateaux en E&s;pagne. Il e&s;t bien
tems de finir cet article, r&eacute;&s;umons nous plus &s;&eacute;rieu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Si vous ex&eacute;cutez le plan que vous avez imagin&eacute;, j'aimerois m&ecirc;me
&agrave; dire que vous embra&s;&s;ez, &s;urtout d'apr&egrave;s ce que vous marquez
vous m&ecirc;me, <HI>Si je ne con&s;ultatis que mon coeur et ma rai&s;on, je romprois
&s;ur le champ cette indigne chaine,</HI> &amp;c. Eh! que voulez vous con&s;ulter,
&s;i ce n'e&s;t votre coeur et votre rai&s;on? Si, dis-je, vous ex&eacute;cutez
ce plan, vous retrouverez une libert&eacute; et une ind&eacute;pendance, que vous
n'auriez jamais du perdre, et dont vous m&eacute;ritez de jouir, une ai&s;ance
qui ne vous co&ucirc;tera qu'un voyage de quelques jours, une tranquil|lit&eacute;
que vous ne pouvez avoir &agrave; Londres, et enfin un ami qui n'a peut
&ecirc;tre pas &eacute;t&eacute; un jour &s;ans pen&s;er &agrave; vous, et qui malgr&eacute; &s;es d&eacute;fauts,
&s;es foible&s;&s;es et &s;on inf&eacute;riorit&eacute;, e&s;t encore un des compagnons qui
vous convient le mieux.</P>
<P>Il me re&s;te &agrave; vous apprendre pourquoi je vous r&eacute;ponds &s;i tard:
vous &s;avez dej&agrave; actuellement que ce n'e&s;t pas manque d'amiti&eacute; et de
zele pour la cho&s;e; mais votre lettre m'a &eacute;t&eacute; renvoy&eacute;e de Lau&s;anne
ici, &agrave; Stra&s;bourg, et je n'ai pa&s;&s;&eacute; qu'une po&s;te &s;ans y r&eacute;pondre, ce qui
n'e&s;t pas trop, vous l'avouerez, pour un pareil bavardage. Je &s;uis
parti de Lau&s;anne la veille de P&acirc;ques pour venir voir un M. Bour|card
de Ba&s;le, fort de mes amis; il e&s;t ici aupr&egrave;s du Comte de
Caglio&s;tro, pour pro&s;iter de &s;es rem&eacute;des. Vous aurez entendu parler
peut &ecirc;tre de cet homme extraordinaire &agrave; tous &eacute;gards. Comme j'ai
&eacute;t&eacute; a&s;&s;ez malade tout l'hyver, je profite au&s;&s;i de &s;es rem&egrave;des; mais
comme le tems du &s;&eacute;jour du Comte ici n'e&s;t rien moins que &s;ur, le
mieux &s;era que vous m'&eacute;criviez <HI>&agrave; M. D. chez M. Bourcard du Kir&s;h|garten,

<HEAD>N^o CLII. M. GIBBON &agrave; M. DEYVERDUN.</HEAD>
<P>JE re&ccedil;ois votre lettre du 10 Juin, le 21 de ce mois. Aujourd'hui
Mardi 24th, je mets la main &agrave; la plume (comme dit M. Fr&eacute;ron)
pour y r&eacute;pondre, quoique ma mi&s;&s;ive ne pui&s;&s;e partir par arrange|ment
des po&s;tes, que Vendredi prochain, 27 du courant. O merveille,
de la grace efficace! Elle n'agit pas moins pui&s;&s;amment &s;ur vous,
et moyennant le &s;ecours toujours pr&ecirc;t, et toujours prompt de nos
couriers, un mois nous &s;uffit pour la demande et la r&eacute;pon&s;e. Je
remercie mille fois le g&eacute;nie de l'amiti&eacute;, qui m'a pou&s;&s;&eacute;, apr&egrave;s mille
efforts inutiles, &agrave; vous &eacute;crire enfin au moment le plus critique et le
plus favorable. Jamais d&eacute;marche n'a r&eacute;pondu &s;i parfaitement &agrave; tous
mes voeux et &agrave; toutes mes e&s;p&eacute;rances. Je comptois &s;ans doute &s;ur
la dur&eacute;e et la v&eacute;rit&eacute; de vos &s;entimens; mais j'ignorois (telle e&s;t la
foible&s;&s;e humaine) ju&s;qu'&agrave; quel point ils avoient pu &ecirc;tre atti&eacute;dis par le
tems et l'&eacute;loignement; et je &s;avois encore moins l'&eacute;tat actuel de
votre &s;ant&eacute;, de votre fortune et de vos liai&s;ons, qui auroient pu
oppo&s;er tant d'ob&s;tacles &agrave; notre r&eacute;union. Vous m'&eacute;crivez, vous
m'aimez toujours; vous d&eacute;&s;irez avec zele, avec ardeur, de r&eacute;ali&s;er nos
anciens projets; vous le pouvez, vous le voulez; vous m'o&s;&s;rez d&egrave;s
l'automne votre mai&s;on, et quelle mai&s;on! votre terra&s;&s;e, et quelle
terra&s;&s;e! votre &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;, et quelle &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;! L'arrangement nous con|vient
&agrave; tous les deux; je retrouve &agrave; la fois le compagnon de ma
jeune&s;&s;e, un &s;age con&s;eiller, et un peintre qui &s;ait repr&eacute;&s;enter et
<PB N="583" REF="604">
exag&eacute;rer m&ecirc;me les objets les plus rians. Ces exag&eacute;rations me font
pour le moins autant de plai&s;ir, que la &s;imple v&eacute;rit&eacute;. Si votre
portrait &eacute;toit tout &agrave; fait re&s;&s;emblant, ces agr&eacute;mens n'exi&s;teroient
que hors de nous m&ecirc;mes, et j'aime encore mieux les trouver dans
la vivacit&eacute; de votre coeur et de votre imagination. Ce n'e&s;t pas que
je ne reconnoi&s;&s;e un grand fond de v&eacute;rit&eacute; dans le tableau de Lau|&s;anne;
je connois le lieu de la &s;c&ecirc;ne, je me tran&s;porte en id&eacute;e &s;ur
notre terra&s;&s;e, je vois ces c&ocirc;teaux, ce lac, ces montagnes, ouvrages
favoris de la nature, et je con&ccedil;ois &s;ans peine les embelli&s;&s;emens que
votre go&ucirc;t s'e&s;t plu y ajouter. Je me rappelle depuis vingt ou trente
ans les moeurs, l'e&s;prit, l'ai&s;ance de la &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;, et je comprends que|ce
v&eacute;ritable ton de la bonne compagnie &s;e perp&eacute;tue, et s'&eacute;pure de pere
en fils, ou plut&ocirc;t de mere en fille; car il m'a toujours paru qu'&agrave; Lau|&s;anne,
au&s;&s;i bien qu'en France, les femmes &s;ont tr&egrave;s &s;up&eacute;rieures aux
hommes. Dans un parcil &s;&eacute;jour, je craindrois la di&s;&s;ipation bien
plus que l'ennui, et le tourbillon de Lau&s;anne &eacute;tonneroit un phi|lo&s;ophe
accoutum&eacute;, depuis tant d'ann&eacute;es &agrave; la tranquillit&eacute; de Lon|dres.
Vous &ecirc;tes trop in&s;truit pour regarder ce propos, comme
une mauvai&s;e plai&s;anterie; c'e&s;t dans les d&eacute;troits qu'on e&s;t en|train&eacute;
par la rapidit&eacute; des courans: il n'y en a point en pleine
mer. D&egrave;&s;qu'on ne recherche plus les plai&s;irs bruyans, et qu'on
s'affranchit volontiers des devoirs p&eacute;nibles, la libert&eacute; d'un &s;imple
particulier &s;e fortifie par l'immen&s;it&eacute; de la ville. Quant &agrave; moi,
l'application &agrave; mon grand ouvrage, l'habitude, et la r&eacute;compen&s;e
du travail, m'ont rendu plus &s;tudieux, plus &s;&eacute;dentaire, plus ami de
la retraite. La chambre des communes et les grands d&igrave;ners exigent
beaucoup de tems; et la temp&eacute;rance d'un repas Anglois, vous permet
de go&ucirc;ter de cinq ou &s;ix vins diff&eacute;rens, et vous ordonne de boire une
bouteille de claret apr&egrave;s le d&eacute;&s;ert. Mais enfin je ne &s;oupe jamais, je
me couche de bonne heure, je re&ccedil;ois peu de vi&s;ites, les matin&eacute;es &s;ont
longues, les &eacute;t&eacute;s &s;ont libres, et d&egrave;&s;que je ferme ma porte; je &s;uis oubli&eacute;
du Monde entier. Dans une &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute; plus born&eacute;e et plus amicale, les
<PB N="584" REF="605">
d&eacute;marches &s;ont publiques, les droits &s;ont r&eacute;ciproques, l'on dine
de bonne heure, on &s;e go&ucirc;te trop pour ne pas pa&s;&s;er l'apr&egrave;s-midi
en&s;emble; on &s;oupe, on veille, et les plai&s;irs de la &s;oir&eacute;e ne lai&s;&s;ent
pas de d&eacute;ranger le repos de la nuit, et le travail du lendemain Quel
e&s;t cependant le r&eacute;&s;ultat de ces plaintes? c'e&s;t &s;eulement que la mari&eacute;e
e&s;t trop belle, et que j'o&s;e me &s;ervir de l'excu&s;e honn&ecirc;te de la &s;ant&eacute;
et du privilege d'un homme de lettres; il ne tiendra qu'&agrave; moi de
mod&eacute;rer un peu l'exc&egrave;s de mes joui&s;&s;ances. Pour cet engouement
que vous m'annoncez, et qui a toujours &eacute;t&eacute; le d&eacute;faut des peuples les
plus &s;pirituels, je l'ai dej&agrave; &eacute;prouv&eacute; &s;ur un plus grand th&eacute;&acirc;tre. Il y a
&s;ix ans que l'ami de Madame Necker fut re&ccedil;u &agrave; Paris, comme celui
de George Deyverdum pourroit l'&ecirc;tre &agrave; Lau&s;anne. Je ne connois
rien de plus flateur que cet accueil favorable d'un public poli et
&eacute;clair&eacute;. Mais cette faveur, &s;i douce pour l'&eacute;tranger, n'e&s;t-elle pas
un peu dangereu&s;e pour l'habitant expo&s;&eacute; &agrave; voir fl&eacute;trir &s;es lauriers,
par &s;a faute ou par l'incon&s;tance des &s;es juges? Non; on &s;e &s;outient
toujours, peut &ecirc;tre pas pr&eacute;ci&s;ement, au m&ecirc;me point d'&eacute;l&eacute;vation.
&Agrave; l'abri de trois gros volumes in quarto en langue &eacute;trang&egrave;re, encore
ce qui n'e&s;t pas un petit avantage, je con&s;erverai toujours la r&eacute;puta|tion
litt&eacute;raire, et cette r&eacute;putation donnera du relief aux qualit&eacute;s
&s;ociales, &s;i l'on trouve l'hi&s;torien &s;ans travers, &s;ans affectation et
&s;ans pr&eacute;ten&s;ions. Je &s;erai donc charm&eacute; et content de votre &s;oci&eacute;t&eacute;,
et j'aurois pu dire en deux mots, ce qui j'ai bavard&eacute; en deux pages;
mais il y a tant de plai&s;ir &agrave; bavarder avec un ami! car en&s;in je
po&s;&s;&egrave;de &agrave; Lau&s;anne un v&eacute;ritable ami; et les &s;imples connoi&s;&s;ances
remplaceront &s;ans beaucoup de peine, tout ce qui s'appelle liai&s;on, et
m&ecirc;me amiti&eacute;, dans ce va&s;te d&eacute;&s;ert de Londres. Mais au moment ou
j'&eacute;cris, je vois de tous c&ocirc;t&eacute;s une foule d'objets dont la perte &s;era bien
plus difficile &agrave; r&eacute;parer. Vous conno&s;&s;iez ma biblioth&egrave;que; mais je

piece qui lui &eacute;toit de&s;tin&eacute;e, elle s'e&s;t d&eacute;bord&eacute;e dans la chambre &s;ur la

tous les recoins de la mai&s;on de <HI>Bentinck-&s;treet,</HI> et ju&s;ques dans une

<P>Le fonds e&s;t de la meilleure compagnie Grecque, Latine, Italienne,
Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e, et Angloi&s;e, et les auteurs les moins chers &agrave; l'homme de go&ucirc;t,
des eccl&eacute;&s;ia&s;tiques, des Byzantins, des Orientaux, &s;ont les plus n&eacute;ce&s;&s;aires
&agrave; l'hi&s;torien de la d&eacute;cadence et de la chute, &amp;c. Vous ne &s;entez que
trop bien le d&eacute;&s;agr&eacute;ment de lai&s;&s;er, et l'impo&s;&s;ibilit&eacute; de tran&s;porter
cinq ou &s;ix milles volumes, d'autant plus que le ciel n'a pas voulu
faire de la Sui&s;&s;e, un pays maritime. Cependant mon zele pour la
r&eacute;u&s;&s;ite de nos projets communs, me fait imaginer que ces ob&s;tacles
pourront s'applanir, et que je puis adoucir ou &s;upporter ces privations
douloureu&s;es. Les bons auteurs cla&s;&s;iques, la bibliotheque des nations,
&s;e retrouvent dans tous les pays. Lau&s;anne n'e&s;t pas d&eacute;pourvu de
livres, ni de polite&s;&s;e, et j'ai dans l'e&s;prit qu'on pourroit acqu&eacute;rir pour
un certain tems, quelque bibliotheque d'un vieillard ou d'un mineur,
dont la famille ne voudroit pas &s;e d&eacute;faire enti&egrave;rement. Quant aux
outils de mon travail, nous commencerons par examiner l'&eacute;tat de
nos riche&s;&s;es; apres quoi il faudroit faire un petit calcul du prix, du
poids et de la raret&eacute; de chaque ouvrage, pour juger de ce qu'il
&s;eroit n&eacute;ce&s;&s;aire de tran&s;porter de Londres, et de ce qu'on acheteroit
plus commod&eacute;ment en Sui&s;&s;e; &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de ces frais, on devroit les
envi&s;ager comme les avances d'une manufacture tran&s;plant&eacute;e en pays
&eacute;tranger, et dont on e&s;pere retirer dans la &s;uite un profit rai&s;onnable.
Malheureu&s;ement votre bibliotheque publique, en y ajoutant m&ecirc;me
celle de M. de Bochat, e&s;t a&s;&s;ez piteu&s;e; mais celles de Berne et de
<PB N="586" REF="607">
Ba&s;le &s;ont tr&egrave;s nombreu&s;es, et je compterois a&s;&s;ez &s;ur la bonhommie
Helv&eacute;tique, pour e&s;p&eacute;rer que, moyennant des recommandations et
des cautions, il me &s;eroit permis d'en tirer les livres dont j'aurois
e&s;&s;entiellement be&s;oin. Vous &ecirc;tes tr&egrave;s bien plac&eacute; pour prendre les
informations, et pour fixer les d&eacute;marches convenables; mais vous
voyez du moins combien je me retourne de tous les c&ocirc;t&eacute;s, pour
e&s;quiver la difficult&eacute; la plus formidable.</P>
<P>Venons &agrave; pre&s;ent &agrave; des objets moins relev&eacute;s, mais tr&egrave;s importans
&agrave; l'exi&s;tence et au bien &ecirc;tre de l'animal, le logement, les dome&s;tiques,
et la table. Pour mon appartement particulier, une chambre &agrave;
coucher, avec un grand cabinet et une antichambre, auroient &s;uffi &agrave;
tous mes be&s;oins; mais &s;i vous pouvez vous en pa&s;&s;er, je me pro|menerai
avec plai&s;ir dans l'immen&s;it&eacute; de vos onze pieces, qui s'ac|commoderont
&s;ans doute aux heures et aux &s;ai&s;ons diff&eacute;rentes. L'article
des dome&s;tiques renferme une a&s;&s;ez forte difficult&eacute;, &s;ur la quelle je
dois vous con&s;ulter. Vous connoi&s;&s;ez, et vous e&s;timez Caplin mon
valet de chambre, maitre d'hotel, &amp;c. qui a &eacute;t&eacute; nourri dans notre
mai&s;on, et qui comptoit y finir &s;es jours. Depuis votre d&eacute;part,
&s;es talens et &s;es vertus &s;e &s;ont d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s de plus en plus, et je le
con&s;idere bien moins &s;ur le pied d'un dome&s;tique, que &s;ur celui
d'un ami. Malheureu&s;ement il ne &s;ait que l'Anglois, et jamais il
n'apprendra de langue &eacute;trang&egrave;re. Il m'accompagna, il y a &s;ix ans,
dans mon voyage &agrave; Paris, mais il rapporta fidelement &agrave; Londres
toute l'ignorance, et tous les pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s d'un bon patriote. &Agrave; Lau|&s;anne
il me co&ucirc;teroit beaucoup, et &agrave; l'exception du &s;ervice per&s;onel,
il ne nous &s;eroit que d'une tr&egrave;s petite utilit&eacute;. Cependant je &s;up|porterois
volontiers cette d&eacute;pen&s;e, mais je &s;uis tr&egrave;s per&s;uad&eacute; que, &s;i
&s;on attachement le portoit &agrave; me &s;uivre, il s'ennuyeroit &agrave; mourir dans
un pays o&ugrave; tout lui &s;eroit &eacute;tranger et d&eacute;&s;agr&eacute;able. Il faudroit donc
me d&eacute;tacher d'un homme dont je connois le zele, la fid&eacute;lit&eacute;, rompre
tout d'un coup de petites habitudes qui &s;ont li&eacute;es avec le bien &ecirc;tre
journalier et momentan&eacute;, et &s;e re&s;oudre &agrave; lui &s;ub&s;tituer un vi&s;age

nouveau, peut &ecirc;tre un mauvais &s;ujet, toujours quelque avanturier
Sui&s;&s;e pris &s;ur le pav&eacute; de Londres. Vous rappellez vous un certain
Georges Sui&s;&s;e qui a fait autrefois avec moi, le voyage de France et
d'Italie? Je le crois mari&eacute; et &eacute;tabli &agrave; Lau&s;anne; s'il vit encore, &s;i
vous pouvez l'engager &agrave; &s;e rendre ici, pour me ramener en Sui&s;&s;e,
la compagnie d'un bon et ancien &s;erviteur ne lai&s;&s;eroit pas d'adoucir
la chute, et il re&s;teroit peut &ecirc;tre aupres de moi, ju&s;qu'&agrave; ce que nous
eu&s;&s;ions choi&s;i un jeune homme du pays, adroit, mode&s;te et bien
&eacute;lev&eacute;, &agrave; qui je ferois un parti avantageux. Les autres dome&s;tiques,
gouvernantes, laquais, cui&s;ini&egrave;re, &amp;c. &s;e prennent et &s;e renvoyent
&s;ans difficult&eacute;. Un article bien plus important, c'e&s;t notre table, car
enfin nous ne &s;ommes pas a&s;&s;ez hermites, pour nous contenter des
l&eacute;gumes et des fruits de votre jardin, tout excellens qu'ils &s;ont; mais
je n'ai pre&s;que rien &agrave; ajouter &agrave; l'honn&ecirc;tet&eacute; de vos propos, qui me
donnent beaucoup plus de plai&s;ir que de &s;urpri&s;e. Si je me trouvois
&s;ans fortune, au lieu de rougir des bienfaits de l'amiti&eacute;, j'accepterois
vos offres au&s;&s;i &s;implement que vous les faites. Mais nous ne &s;om|mes
pas r&eacute;duits &agrave; ce point, et vous comprenez a&s;&s;ez qu'une d&eacute;con|&s;iture
Angloi&s;e lai&s;&s;e encore une fortune fort d&eacute;cente au Pays de Vaud,
et pour vous dire quelque cho&s;e de plus pr&eacute;cis, je d&eacute;pen&s;erois &s;ans
peine et &s;ans inconvenient cinq ou &s;ix cens Louis. Vous connoi&s;&s;ez
le r&eacute;&s;ultat au&s;&s;i bien que les d&eacute;tails d'un m&eacute;nage; en &s;uppo&s;ant une
petite table de deux philo&s;ophes Epicuriens, quatre, cinq, ou &s;ix
dome&s;tiques, des amis a&s;&s;ez &s;ouvent, des repas a&s;&s;ez rarement, beau|coup
de &s;en&s;ualit&eacute;, et peu de luxe, &agrave; combien e&s;timez vous en gros
le d&eacute;pen&s;e d'un mois et d'une ann&eacute;e? Le partage que vous avez dej&agrave;
fait, me paro&icirc;t des plus rai&s;onnables; vous me logez, et je vous
nourris. &Agrave; votre calcul, j'ajouterois mon entretien per&s;onnel, habits,

<P>YOU will read the following lines with more patience and attention
than you would probably give to an ha&s;ty conference, perpe|tually
interrupted by the opening of the door, and perhaps by the
quickne&s;s of our own tempers. I neither expect nor de&s;ire an an|&s;wer
on a &s;ubject of extreme importance to my&s;elf, but which
friend&s;hip alone can render intere&s;ting to you. We &s;hall &s;oon meet
at Sheffield.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to repeat the reflections which we have &s;ometimes
debated together, and which I have often &s;eriou&s;ly weighed in my
&s;ilent &s;olitary walks. Notwith&s;tanding your active and ardent &s;pirit,
you mu&s;t allow that there is &s;ome perplexity in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation,
and that my future pro&s;pects are di&s;tant and cloudy. I have lived
too long in the world to entertain a very &s;anguine idea of the friend|&s;hip
or zeal of mini&s;terial patrons; and we are all &s;en&s;ible how much
the powers of patronage are reduced. * * *.
At the end of the Parliament, or rather
long before that time, (for their lives are not worth a year's pur|cha&s;e,)
our Mini&s;ters are kicked down &s;tairs, and I am left their di&s;|intere&s;ted
friend, to fight through another oppo&s;ition, and to expect
the fruits of another revolution. But I will take a more favourable
&s;uppo&s;ition, and conceive my&s;elf in &s;ix months firmly &s;eated at the
board of cu&s;toms; before the end of the next &s;ix months I &s;hould
infallibly hang my&s;elf. In&s;tead of regretting my di&s;appointment, I
rejoice in my e&s;cape; as I am &s;atisfied that no &s;alary could pay me
for the irk&s;omene&s;s of attendance, and the drudgery of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o
<PB N="594" REF="615">
repugnant to my ta&s;te, (and I will dare to &s;ay,) &s;o unworthy of my
character. Without looking forwards to the po&s;&s;ibility, &s;till more
remote, of exchanging that laborious office for a &s;maller annuity,
there is &s;urely another plan, more rea&s;onable, more &s;imple, and more
plea&s;ant; a temporary retreat to a quiet and le&s;s expen&s;ive &s;cene.
In a four years re&s;idence at Lau&s;anne, I &s;hould live within my in|come,
&s;ave, and even accumulate, my ready money; fini&s;h my
Hi&s;tory, an object of profit, as well as fame, expect the contin|gencies
of elderly lives, and return to England at the age of fifty,
to form a la&s;ting independent e&s;tabli&s;hment, without courting the
&s;miles of a Mini&s;ter, or apprehending the downfal of a party. Such
have been my &s;erious &s;ober reflections. Yet I much que&s;tion,
whether I &s;hould have found courage to follow my rea&s;on and
my inclination, if a friend had not &s;tretched his hand to draw me
out of the dirt. The twentieth of la&s;t May I wrote to my friend
Deyverdun, after a long interval of &s;ilence, to expo&s;e my &s;ituation,
and to con&s;ult in what manner I might be&s;t arrange my&s;elf at Lau|&s;anne.
From his an&s;wer, which I received about a fortnight ago,
I have the plea&s;ure to learn, that his heart and his hou&s;e are both
open for my reception; that a family which he had lodged for &s;ome
years is about to leave him, and that at no other time my company
could have been &s;o acceptable and convenient. I &s;hall &s;tep, at my
arrival, into an excellent apartment and a delightful &s;ituation; the fair
divi&s;ion of our expences will render them very moderate, and I &s;hall
pa&s;s my time with the companion of my youth, who&s;e temper and
&s;tudies have alwayes been congenial to my own. I have given him
my word of honour to be at Lau&s;anne in the beginning of October,
and no power or per&s;ua&s;ion can divert me from this IRREVOCABLE
re&s;olution, which I am every day proceeding to execute.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, but I &s;carcely hope, to convince you of the propriety of
my &s;cheme; but at lea&s;t you will allow, that when we are not able to
prevent the <HI>follies</HI> of our friends, we &s;hould &s;trive to render them as
<PB N="595" REF="616">
ea&s;y and harmle&s;s as po&s;&s;ible. The arrangement of my hou&s;e, fur|niture,
and books will be left to meaner hands, but it is to your zeal
and judgment alone that I can tru&s;t the more important di&s;po&s;al of
Lenborough and * * *. On the&s;e &s;ubjects we may go
into a committee at Sheffield-Place, but you know it is the rule of a
committee, not to hear any arguments again&s;t the <HI>principle</HI> of the
bill. At pre&s;ent I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that neither of the&s;e negocia|tions
ought to detain me here; the former may be di&s;patched as well,
the latter much better, in my ab&s;ence. <HI>Vale.</HI></P>

le &s;uperflu, que vous oubliez l'e&s;&s;entiel, et ce n'e&s;t que
par des conjectures &s;ines et &s;avantes que je devine la date du tems et du

&agrave; quarante milles de Londres, ce qui ajoute deux jours pour l'arriv&eacute;e
et le d&eacute;part du courier. Je re&ccedil;ois votre lettre (je ne &s;ais du quan|ti&egrave;me)
le 30 Juillet de l'an de grace 1783, je r&eacute;ponds du 31 du dit mois
et de la dite ann&eacute;e. Le zele ne &s;e rallentit point pour la con&s;umma|tion
du grand oeuvre. Je &s;ens votre proc&eacute;d&eacute; d&eacute;licat et g&eacute;n&eacute;reux, et
quoique je n'eu&s;&s;e pas &eacute;t&eacute; fach&eacute; de trouver dans votre fermet&eacute;, un
appui &agrave; la mienne, mon inclination e&s;t &s;i bien affermie &s;ur la ba&s;e
in&eacute;branlable de l'inclination et de la rai&s;on, que je ne crains plus les
ob&s;tacles ext&eacute;rieurs ni int&eacute;rieurs. D&egrave;&s;que j'ai o&s;&eacute; &s;ixer mon d&eacute;part,
les nuages qui le couvroient, &s;e &s;ont &eacute;vanouis; les montagnes s'ap|lani&s;&s;oient
devant moi, et les dragons qui s'&eacute;toient pr&eacute;&s;ent&eacute;s &s;ur

<PB N="596" REF="617">
grand coup par la ca&s;&s;ation du bail de ma mai&s;on de <HI>Bentinck-&s;treet;</HI>
et apr&egrave;s le mois de Septembre, &s;i je ne couche pas &agrave; Lau&s;anne, je
coucherai dans la rue. Mes diff&eacute;rens bonnets de nuit s'arrangent
tous les jours, avec beaucoup d'ordre et de facilit&eacute;. Lord Sheffield
lui m&ecirc;me, ce terrible St. George, vrai champion de l'Angleterre, s'e&s;t
rendu &agrave; mes rai&s;ons, ou plut&ocirc;t aux votres. Il e&s;t charm&eacute; du tableau
de votre premi&egrave;re lettre, et malgr&eacute; l'activit&eacute; de &s;on ame, au lieu de
me condamner, il me porte envie; et nous di&s;putons (un peu en
l'air) &s;ur le projet d'une vi&s;ite que lui, &s;on amiable compagne et &s;a
fille ain&eacute;e, &s;e propo&s;ent de nous faire dans deux ans aux bords du
Lac L&eacute;man. Bien loin de combattre mon de&s;&s;ein, il me con&s;eille,
il me &s;econde dans l'ex&eacute;cution, et je n'aurai pas be&s;oin de recourir
aux lumi&egrave;res de votre ami Louis Tey&s;&s;ier, d'autant plus que pour les
menus d&eacute;tails de la corre&s;pondence &eacute;trang&egrave;re, je trouve dans le
libraire Elm&s;ly un con&s;eiller &s;age, in&s;truit et di&s;cret. * * *
Votre calcul de la d&eacute;pen&s;e de la mai&s;on &s;urpa&s;&s;e, non pas ab&s;olument
mes moyens, mais un peu mes e&s;p&eacute;rances et mes conjectures. La
con&s;ummation en Sui&s;&s;e n'e&s;t point charg&eacute;e d'impots; le vin y coule
comme l'eau de fontaine; votre jardin produit des fruits et des
l&eacute;gumes. Se peut il que vingt ou trente Louis &s;e d&eacute;pen&s;ent tous les
mois pour le pain, la viande, le bois, la chandelle, quelque peu de
vin &eacute;tranger, les dome&s;tiques de la cui&s;ine, &amp;c.? Je me flatte que
dans l'incertitude, vous avez cav&eacute; au plus fort; mais enfin tout ce
d&eacute;tail &s;e r&eacute;glera &s;uivant nos go&ucirc;ts et nos facult&eacute;s; et un mois d'ex|p&eacute;rience
&s;era plus in&s;tructif que cent pages de rai&s;onnemens. La
comparai&s;on que vous me demandez de mon m&eacute;nage de Londres, ne
meneroit &agrave; rien. &Agrave; la riguerur je ne tiens pas mai&s;on; je ne donne
pre&s;que jamais &agrave; manger: en hyver je dine a&s;&s;ez rarement chez moi;
je ne &s;oupe jamais; et une partie a&s;&s;ez con&s;id&eacute;rable de la d&eacute;pen&s;e
(celle des clubs et des <HI>tavernes</HI>) n'entre point dans le compte de la
<PB N="597" REF="618">
mai&s;on. Ma nourriture dome&s;tique n'excede pas toutefois votre
calcul Lau&s;annois; mais je &s;ens la diff&eacute;rence entre le petit couvert
tri&s;te et me&s;quin d'un gar&ccedil;on, et la table honn&ecirc;te et ho&s;pitali&egrave;re de
deux amis, qui auront d'autres amis, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Votre id&eacute;e de ma&s;quer mes grands op&eacute;rations e&s;t de la plus pro|fonde
politique; mais les d&eacute;clarations, et m&ecirc;me les d&eacute;marches qui
&s;eront n&eacute;ce&s;&s;aires pour me retirer de la Chambre des Communes, d&eacute;|clareront
un peu trop tot l'&eacute;tendue de mes projets. Cependant on
peut tirer quelque parti de cette honn&ecirc;te di&s;&s;imulation, pour calmer
un peu les &s;crupules, et les regrets des dames ag&eacute;es que vous con|noi&s;&s;ez,
et que vous ne connoi&s;&s;ez pas. Mais le moyen le plus effi|cace
pour arr&ecirc;ter, ou pour ne pas &eacute;couter les mauvais di&s;cours, c'e&s;t
de s'y d&eacute;rober par une prompte fuite, et depuis que ma r&eacute;&s;olution a
&eacute;t&eacute; pri&s;e, je compte les jours et les momens. Le 10 du mois prochain
je retournerai &agrave; Londres, o&ugrave; je travaillerai vivement &agrave; pr&eacute;parer ce
grand changement d'&eacute;tat. J'attends tous les jours la r&eacute;pon&s;e de Ma|dame
Gibbon, &agrave; qui j'ai t&acirc;ch&eacute; de per&s;uader qu'une entrevue de trois
ou quatre jours &agrave; Bath, &s;eroit moins douce qu'am&egrave;re &agrave; tous les deux.
Si elle &s;e rend, ou fait &s;emblant de &s;e rendre &agrave; mes rai&s;ons, je
compte que tout fini la premi&egrave;re, ou du moins la &s;econde &s;e|maine
de Septembre, et comme je couperai droit par la Champagne,
et la Franche-Comt&eacute;, je pourrois fort bien me trouver &agrave; Lau&s;anne
vers le 20 ou le 25 de ce mois l&agrave;, &s;uppo&s;&eacute; toujours que cette prompti|tude
vous convienne, que votre mai&s;on &s;era libre, et que vous y

Stra&s;bourg, de vous prendre &agrave; Ba&s;le, et de pa&s;&s;er avec vous par
Berne, &amp;c. mais, tout bien con&s;id&eacute;r&eacute;, j'aime mieux abr&eacute;ger le grand
voyage et r&eacute;&s;erver cette promenade (&s;i nous avions envie de la faire)
pour une &s;ai&s;on plus tranquille. J'attends votre r&eacute;pon&s;e dans une
trentaine de jours; mais &s;ans l'attendre je vous &eacute;crirai de Londres,
pour continuer le fil de l'hi&s;toire, et peut &ecirc;tre pour vous charger de

heart at Sheffield-Place. Bu&s;ine&s;s advances; this morning my books
were &s;hipped for Rouen, and will reach Lau&s;anne almo&s;t as &s;oon
as my&s;elf. On Thur&s;day morning the bulk of the library moves
from Bentinck-&s;treet to Downing-&s;treet. I &s;hall e&s;cape from the

leave. I want to know your preci&s;e motions, what day you arrive
in town, whether you vi&s;it Lord * * * before the races,
&amp;c. I am now impatient to be gone, and &s;hall only wait for a la&s;t

j'ai manqu&eacute; &agrave; ceux qui me quittent, et &agrave; celui qui vient me joindre;
enfin je me &s;uis tr&egrave;s mal conduit. M. * * *, qui loge chez moi,

que ne doutant pas qu'il ne trouv&acirc;t &agrave; s'arranger pendant tout l'&eacute;t&eacute;,
je la regardois dej&agrave; d'avance comme vacante. Le plai&s;ir extr&ecirc;me
que j'avois &agrave; vous l'offrir, n'a pas peu contribu&eacute; &agrave; &s;outenir cette il|lu&s;ion;
en&s;in n'entendant parler cependant de rien, je lui ai &eacute;crit,
apr&egrave;s avoir re&ccedil;u il y a &s;ix jours votre derni&egrave;re, et il vient de me
<PB N="600" REF="621">
r&eacute;pondre qu'il n'&agrave; rien trouv&eacute; encore, mais qu'il n'&eacute;pargnera ni &s;oins

il &eacute;toit que&s;tion; mais je l'ai pri&eacute; de me dire &agrave; quelle &eacute;poque il

deux petits cabinets, o&ugrave; vous pourriez &ecirc;tre pa&s;&s;ablement, en attend|ant
que la mai&s;on f&ucirc;t tout &agrave; fait libre; le tout e&s;t &agrave; plein pied de la

pourrions nous faire apporter &agrave; manger, cho&s;e pratiqu&eacute;e par nombre
de Grands Seigneurs, entr'autres par Mon&s;eigneur le Margrave

en&s;emble. Ou en&s;in 3. pa&s;&s;er l'hyver dans quelle autre ville
du Continent qu'il vous plaira choi&s;ir, ou j'irai vous joindre et vous
porter mes excu&s;es. Une r&eacute;flexion que je fais dans ce moment ci, et
qui me con&s;ole un peu, c'e&s;t que dans votre premi&egrave;re lettre, votre r&eacute;&s;o|lution
ne tenoit point &agrave; ma mai&s;on, ni m&ecirc;me &agrave; l'id&eacute;e de loger et vivre

premier ne &s;era que diff&eacute;r&eacute;; ain&s;i appai&s;ez vous, mon cherami, pardonnez
moi, et &eacute;crivez moi tout de &s;uite lequel de ces partis vous convient le
mieux, pour que je m'y conforme; ou &s;i vous en imaginez un nouveau,
annoncez le moi. Une r&eacute;flexion qui contribue encore &agrave; me con&s;oler,
c'e&s;t que pendant le tems que nous camperons ain&s;i en quelque mani&egrave;re,
nous aurons le tems de bien voir autour de nous, et de nous arranger
&agrave; notre ai&s;e, d'une mani&egrave;re &s;table et commode pour notre &eacute;tabli&s;&s;e|ment.

Lau&s;anne. I lo&s;t &s;ight of our almo&s;t certain meeting at the end of
a term, which, at our age, cannot appear very di&s;tant; nor could I
amu&s;e my unea&s;ine&s;s with the hopes, the more doubtful pro&s;pect, of
your vi&s;it to Switzerland. The agitation of preparing every thing
for my departure has, in &s;ome degree, diverted the&s;e melancholy

<P>Surely never any thing was &s;o unlucky as the un&s;ea&s;onable death of
Sir John Ru&s;&s;el on his pa&s;&s;age to his friend at Sheffield-Place, which
&s;o &s;trongly reminded us of the in&s;tability of human life and human

that the air of your favourite Brighton, the bathing, and the quiet

without giving way to melancholy fears, my rea&s;on conjectures that
his indolence thought it &s;uperfluous to write any more, that it was
my bu&s;ine&s;s to act and move, and his duty to &s;it &s;till and receive me
with open arms. At lea&s;t he is well informed of my operations, as
I wrote to him (&s;ince his la&s;t) July thirty-fir&s;t, from Sheffiield-Place;

<P>I ARRIVED &s;afe in harbour la&s;t Saturday, the 27th in&s;tant, about
ten o'clock in the morning; but as the po&s;t only goes out twice
a week, it was not in my power to write before this day. Except
one day, between Langres and Be&s;an&ccedil;on, which was laborious
enough, I fini&s;hed my ea&s;y and gentle airing without any fatigue,
either of mind or body. I found Deyverdum well and happy, but
much more happy at the &s;ight of a friend, and the accompli&s;hment
of a &s;cheme which he had &s;o long and impatiently de&s;ired. His
garden, terrace, and <HI>park,</HI> have even exceeded the mo&s;t &s;anguine of
my expectations and remembrances; and you your&s;elf cannot have
<PB N="611" REF="632">
forgotten the charming pro&s;pect of the lake, the mountains, and the de|clivity
of the Pays de Vaud. But as human life is perpetually chequered
with good and evil, I have found &s;ome di&s;appointments on my arrival.
The ea&s;y nature of Deyverdun, his indolence, and his impatience,
had promted him to reckon too po&s;itively that his hou&s;e would be
vacant at Michaelmas; &s;ome unfore&s;een difficulties have ari&s;en, or
have been di&s;covered when it was already too late, and the con&s;um|mation
of our hopes is (I am much afraid) po&s;tponed to next
&s;pring. At fir&s;t I was knocked down by the unexpected thunder|bolt,
but I have gradually been reconciled to my fate, and have
granted a free and gracious pardon to my friend. As his own apart|ment,
which afforded me a temporary &s;helter, is much too narrow
for a &s;ettled re&s;idence, we hired for the winter a convenient ready-furni&s;hed
apartment in the neare&s;t part of the Rue de Bourg, who&s;e
back door leads in three &s;teps to the terrace and garden, as often as
a tolerable day &s;hall tempt us to enjoy their beauties; and this ar|rangement
has even its advantage, of giving us time to deliberate
and provide, before we enter on larger and more regular e&s;tabli&s;h|ment.
But this is not the &s;um of my misfortunes; hear, and pity!
The day after my arrival (Sunday) we had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a very tem|perate
dinner, and intended to begin a round of vi&s;its on foot,
<HI>chapeau &s;ous le bras,</HI> when, mo&s;t unfortunately, Deyverdun propo&s;ed
to &s;hew me &s;omething in the court; we boldly and &s;ucce&s;sfully
a&s;cended a flight of &s;tone &s;teps, but in the de&s;cent I mi&s;&s;ed my foot|ing,
and &s;trained, or &s;prained, my ancle in a painful manner. My
old latent enemy, (I do not mean the Devil,) who is always on the
watch, has made an ungenerous u&s;e of his advantage, and I much
fear that my arrival at Lau&s;anne will be marked with a fit of the
gout, though it is quite unnece&s;&s;ary that the intelligence or &s;u&s;picion
&s;hould find its way to Bath. Ye&s;terday afternoon I lay, or at lea&s;t
&s;at, in &s;tate to receive vi&s;its, and at the &s;ame moment my room was
filled with four different nations. The loude&s;t of the&s;e nations
<PB N="612" REF="633">
was the &s;ingle voice of the Abb&eacute; Raynal, who, like your friend,
has cho&s;en this place for the a&s;ylum of freedom and hi&s;tory. His
conver&s;ation, which might be very agreeable, is intolerably loud,
peremptory, and in&s;olent; and you would imagine that he alone
was the monarch and legi&s;lator of the world. Adieu. I embrace
my Lady, and the infants. With regard to the important tran&s;ac|tions
for which you are con&s;tituted plenipotentiary, I expect with
&s;ome impatience, but with perfect confidence, the re&s;ult of your la|bours.
You may remember what I mentioned of my conver&s;ation
with * * * about the place of Mini&s;ter at Bern: I have
talked it over with Deyverdun, who does not di&s;like the idea, pro|vided
this place was allowed to be my villa, during at lea&s;t two-thirds
of the year; but for my part, I am &s;ure that * * * are
worth more than mini&s;terial friend&s;hip and gratitude; &s;o I am in|clined
to think, that they are preferable to an office which would be
procured with difficulty, enjoyed with con&s;traint and expence, and
lo&s;t, perhaps, next April, in the annual revolutions of our dome&s;tic
Government. Again adieu.</P>

<P>THE progre&s;s of my gout is in general &s;o regular, and there is
&s;o much uniformity in the Hi&s;tory of its Decline and Fall, that
I have hitherto indulged my lazine&s;s, without much &s;hame or re|mor&s;e,
without &s;uppo&s;ing that you would be very anxious for my
&s;afety, which has been &s;ufficiently provided for by the triple care of
my friend Deyverdun, my humbler friend Caplin, and a very con|ver&s;able
phy&s;ician, (not the famous Ti&s;&s;ot,) who&s;e ordinary fee is ten
batz, about fifteen pence Engli&s;h. After the u&s;ual increa&s;e and de|crea&s;e
<PB N="613" REF="634">
of the member (for it has been confined to the injured part)
the gout has retired in good order, and the remains of weakne&s;s,
which obliged me to move on the rugged pavement of Lau&s;anne
with a &s;tick, or rather &s;mall crutch, are to be a&s;cribed to the &s;prain,
which might have been a much more &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s. As I have
now &s;pent a month at Lau&s;anne, you will enquire with much cu|rio&s;ity,
more kindne&s;s, and &s;ome mixture of &s;pite and malignity,
how far the place has an&s;wered my expectations, and whether I do
not repent of re&s;olution which has appeared &s;o ra&s;h and ridiculous
to my ambitious friends? To this que&s;tion, however natural and
rea&s;onable, I &s;hall not return an immediate an&s;wer, for two rea&s;ons:
1. <HI>I have not yet made a fair trial.</HI> The di&s;appointment and delay with
regard to Deyverdun's hou&s;e, will con&s;ine us this winter to lodgings,
rather convenient than &s;pacious or plea&s;ant. I am only beginning
to recover my &s;tength and liberty, and to look about on per&s;ons and
things; the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e per&s;ons are in the country taken
up with their vintage; my books are not yet arrived, and, in &s;hort,
I cannot look upon my&s;elf as &s;ettled in that comfortable way which
you and I under&s;tand and reli&s;h. Yet the weather has been hea|venly,
and till this time, the end of October, we enjoy the bright|ne&s;s
of the fun, and &s;omewhat gently complain of its immoderate
heat. 2. If I &s;hould be too &s;anguine in explaining my &s;atisfaction
in what I have done, you would a&s;cribe that &s;atisfaction to the no|velty
of the &s;cene, and the incon&s;tancy of man; and I deem it far
more &s;afe and prudent to po&s;tpone any po&s;itive declaration, till I am
placed by experience beyond the danger of repentance and recanta|tion.
Yet of one thing I am &s;ure, that I po&s;&s;e&s;s in this country, as
well as in England, the be&s;t cordial of life, a &s;incere, tender, and
&s;en&s;ible friend, adorned with the mo&s;t valuable and plea&s;ant qualities
both of the heart and head. The inferiour enjoyments of lei&s;ure
and &s;ociety are likewi&s;e in my power; and in the &s;hort excur&s;ions
which I have hitherto made, I have commenced or renewed my ac|quaintance
<PB N="614" REF="635">
with a certain number of per&s;ons, more e&s;pecially wo|men,

to our prouder &s;ex,) of rational minds and elegant manners.
I breakfa&s;t alone, and have declared that I receive no vi&s;its in a
morning, which you will ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e is devoted to &s;tudy. I find
it impo&s;&s;ible, without inconvenience, to defer my dinner beyond two
o'clock. We have got a very good woman cook. Deyverdun,
who is &s;omewhat of an Epicurean philo&s;opher, under&s;tands the ma|nagement
of a table, and we frequently invite a gue&s;t or two to
&s;hare our luxurious, but not extravagant repa&s;ts. The afternoons
are (and will be much more &s;o hereafter) devoted to &s;ociety, and I
&s;hall &s;ind it nece&s;&s;ary to play at cards much oftener than in London:
but I do not di&s;like that way of pa&s;&s;ing a couple of hours, and I
&s;hall not be ruined at &s;hilling whi&s;t. As yet I have not &s;upped, but
in the cour&s;e of the winter I mu&s;t &s;ometimes &s;acrifice an evening
abroad, and in exchange I hope &s;ometimes to &s;teal a day at home,
without going into company * * *.
I have all this time been talking to Lord Sheffield; I hope that he has
di&s;patched my affairs, and it would give me plea&s;ure to hear that I
am no longer member for Lymington, nor Lord of <HI>Lenborough.</HI>
Adieu. I feel every day that the di&s;tance only to make me
think with more tenderne&s;s of the per&s;ons whom I love.</P>

<P>LAST Tue&s;day, November eleventh, after plaguing and vexing
your&s;elf all the morning, about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of your fertile
creation, you went to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and pa&s;&s;ed the after|noon,
<PB N="615" REF="636">
the evening, and perhaps the night, without &s;leep or food,
&s;tifled in a clo&s;e room by the heated re&s;piration of &s;ix hundred po|liticians,
inflamed by party and pa&s;&s;ion, and tired of the repetition
of dull non&s;en&s;e, which, in that illu&s;trious a&s;&s;embly, &s;o far out|weighs
the proportion of rea&s;on and eloquence. On the &s;ame day,
after a &s;tudious morning, a friendly dinner, and a cheerful a&s;&s;embly
of both &s;exes, I retired to re&s;t at eleven o'clock, &s;atisfied with the
pa&s;t day, and certain that the next would afford me the return of the
&s;ame quiet and rational enjoyments. <HI>Which has the better bargain?</HI>
Seriou&s;ly, I am every hour more grateful to my own judgment and
re&s;olution, and only regret that I &s;o long delayed the execution of
a favourite plan, which I am convinced is the be&s;t adapted to my
character an inclinations. You conjecture of the revolutions of
my face, when I heard that the hou&s;e was for this winter inace&s;&s;ible,
is probable, but fal&s;e. I bore my di&s;appointment with the temper of
a &s;age, and only u&s;e it to render the pro&s;pect of next year &s;till more
plea&s;ing to my imagination. You are likewi&s;e mi&s;taken, in imput|ing
my fall to the awkwardne&s;s of my limbs. The &s;ame accident
might have happened to Sling&s;by him&s;elf, or to any <HI>hero</HI> of the age;
the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for his <HI>bodily activity.</HI> I have now re&s;umed
my entire &s;trength, and walk with caution, yet with &s;peed and
&s;afety, through the &s;treets of this mountainous city. After a month
of the fine&s;t autumn I ever &s;aw, the <HI>bi&s;e</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The North Ea&s;t wind.</NOTE> made me feel my old
acquaintance; the weather is now milder, and this pre&s;ent day is
dark and rainy, not much better than what you probably enjoy in
England. The town is comparatively empty, but the Noble&s;&s;e are
returning every day from their chateaux, and I already perceive that
I &s;hall more rea&s;on to complain to complain of di&s;&s;ipation than of dulne&s;s,
As I told Lady S. I am afraid of being too ra&s;h and ha&s;ty in ex|pre&s;&s;ing
my &s;atisfaction; but I mu&s;t again repeat, that appearances
<PB N="616" REF="637">
are extremely favourable. I am &s;en&s;ible that general prai&s;e conveys
no di&s;tinct ideas, but it is very difficult to enter into particulars
where the individuals are unknown, or indifferent to our corre|&s;pondent.
You have forgotten the <HI>old</HI> generation, and in twenty years
a new one is grown up. Death has &s;wept many from the world,
and chance or choice has brought many to this place. If you en|quire
after your old acquaintance Catherine, you mu&s;t be told, that
&s;he is &s;olitary, ugly, blind, and univer&s;ally forgotten. Your later
flame, and our common godde&s;s, the Eliza, pa&s;&s;ed a month at the
inn. She came to con&s;ult Ti&s;&s;ot, and was acquainted with Cerjat.
And now to bu&s;ine&s;s. * * *
With regard to meaner ca&s;es, the&s;e are two, which you can and
will undertake. 1. As I have not renounced my country, I &s;hould
be glad to hear of your parliamentary &s;quabbles, which may be
done with &s;mall trouble and expence. After an intere&s;ting debate,
my Lady in due time may cut the &s;peeches from Woodfall. You
will write or dictate any curious anecdote, and the whole, inclo&s;ed
in a letter, may be di&s;patched to Lau&s;anne. 2. A &s;et of Wedge|wood
china, which we talked of in London, and which would be
mo&s;t acceptable here. As you have a <HI>&s;ort</HI> of a ta&s;te, I leave to
your own choice the colour and the pattern; but as I have the in|clination
and means to live very hand&s;omely <HI>here,</HI> I de&s;ire that the
&s;ize and number of things may be adequate to a plentiful table. If
you &s;ee Lord North, a&s;&s;ure him of my gratitude; had he been a
more &s;ucce&s;sful friend, I &s;hould now be drudging at the Board of
Cu&s;toms, or vexed with bu&s;ine&s;s in the amiable &s;ociety of&mdash;.
To Lord Loughborough pre&s;ent an affectionate &s;entiment; I am &s;a|tisfied
of his intention to &s;erve me, if I had not been in &s;uch a
fidget. I am &s;ure you will not fail, while you are in town, to vi&s;it
and comfort poor aunt Kitty. I wrote to her on my fir&s;t arrival,
and &s;he may be a&s;&s;ured that I will not neglect her. To my Lady I
<PB N="617" REF="638">
&s;ay nothing; we have now our private corre&s;pondence, into which
the eye of an hu&s;band &s;hould not be permitted to intrude. I am
really &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of the pamphlet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on the Commerce with the American States.</NOTE>; not only becau&s;e
I have a &s;neaking kindne&s;s for the author, but as it &s;hews me that
plain &s;en&s;e, full information, and warm &s;pirit, are &s;till acceptable in
the world. You talk of Lau&s;anne as a place of retirement, yet,
from the &s;ituation and freedom of the Pays de Vaud, all nations,
and all extraordinary characters, are a&s;toni&s;hed to meet each other.
The Abb&eacute; Raynal, the grand Gibbon, and Mercier, author of the
<HI>Tableau de Paris,</HI> have been in the &s;ame room. The other day the
Prince and Prince&s;s de Ligne, the Duke and Duche&s;s d'Ur&s;el, &amp;c.
came from Bru&s;&s;els on purpo&s;e (literally true) to act a comedy at
* * *, in the country. He was dying, and could not
appear; but we had comedy, ball, and &s;upper. The event &s;eems to
have revived him; for that great man is fallen from his ancient
glory, and his neare&s;t relations refu&s;e to &s;ee him. I told you of
poor Catherine's deplorable &s;tate; but Madame de Me&s;ery, at the age
of &s;ixty-nine, is &s;till hand&s;ome. Adieu.</P>

<P>I HAVE received both your epi&s;tles; and as any excu&s;e will &s;erve a
man who is at the &s;ame time very bu&s;y and very idle, I patiently
expected the &s;econd, before I entertained any thoughts of an&s;wering
the fir&s;t. * * *
I therefore conclude, that on every principle of common &s;en&s;e, be|fore
this moment your active zeal has already expelled me from the
<PB N="618" REF="639">
hou&s;e, to which, without regret, I bid an everla&s;ting farewel. The
agreeable hour of five o'clock in the morning, at which you com|monly
retire, does not tend to revive my attachment; but if you add
the &s;oft hours of your morning Committee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;elect Committee for inquiring into frauds committed in re&s;pect to the revenue.</NOTE>, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of taxes,
cu&s;toms, frauds, &s;mugglers, &amp;c. I think I &s;hould beg to be relea&s;ed
and quietly &s;ent to the gallies, as a place of lei&s;ure and freedom.
Yet I do not depart from my general principles of toleration. Some
animals are made to live in the water, others on the earth, many in
the air, and &s;ome, as it is now believed, even in fire. Your pre&s;ent
hurry of Parliament I perfectly under&s;tand; when oppo&s;ition make
the attack,
<Q><L>&mdash;Horae</L>
<L>Momento cita mors venit, aut victoria laeta.</L></Q>
But when the Mini&s;ter brings forward any &s;trong and deci&s;ive mea|&s;ure,
the at length prevails; but his progre&s;s is retarded at every &s;tep,
and in every &s;tage of the bill, by a pertinacious, though un&s;ucce&s;sful,
minority. I am not &s;orry to hear of the &s;plendour of Fox; I am
proud, in a foreign country, of his fame and abilities, and our little
animo&s;ities are extingui&s;hed by my retreat from the Engli&s;h &s;tage.
With regard to the &s;ub&s;tance of the bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;carcely know what
to think: the vices of the Company<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ea&s;t India Company.</NOTE>, both in their per&s;ons and their
con&s;titution, were manifold and manife&s;t; the danger was imminent,
and &s;uch an empire, with thirty millions of &s;ubjects, was not to be
lo&s;t for trifles. Yet, on the other hand, the faith of charters, the
rights of property! I he&s;itate and tremble. Such an innovation
would at lea&s;t require that the remedy &s;hould be as certain as the
evil, and the proprietors may perhaps in&s;inuate, that <HI>they</HI> were as
competent guardians of their own affairs, as either * * *
or * * *. Their acting without a &s;alary, &s;eems
childi&s;h, and their not being removable by the Crown, is a &s;trange
<PB N="619" REF="640">
and dangerous precedent. But enough of politics, which I now be|gin
to view through a thin, cold, di&s;tant cloud, yet not without a
rea&s;onable degree of curio&s;ity and patrioti&s;m. From the papers
(e&s;pecially when you add an occa&s;ional &s;lice of the Chronicle) I &s;hall
be amply informed of facts and debates. From you I expect the
cau&s;es, rather than the events, the true &s;prings of action, and tho&s;e
intere&s;ting ancedotes which &s;eldom a&s;cend the garret of a Fleet-&s;treet
editor. You &s;ay that many friends (alias acquaintance) have ex|pre&s;&s;ed
curio&s;ity and concern; I &s;hould not wi&s;h to be immediately
forgotten. That others (you once mentioned Gerard Hamilton) con|demn
Government, for &s;uffering the departure of a man who might
have done them &s;ome credit and &s;ome &s;ervice, perhaps as much as
* * * him&s;elf. To you, in the confidence of friend&s;hip,
and without either pride or re&s;entment, I will fairly own that I am
&s;omewhat of Gerards's opinion; and if I did not compare it with
the re&s;t of his character, I &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed that * * *
&s;uffered me to depart, without even a civil an&s;wer to my letter.
Were I capable of hating a man, whom it is not ea&s;y to hate, I &s;hould
&s;ind my&s;elf amply revenged by * * *. But the happy &s;ouls in
Paradi&s;e are &s;u&s;ceptible only of love and pity, and though Lau&s;anne is
not a Paradi&s;e, more e&s;pecially in winter, I do a&s;&s;ure you, in &s;ober
profe, that it has hitherto fulfilled, and even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, my warme&s;t
expectation. Yet I often ca&s;t a look toward Sheffield-Place, where
you now repo&s;e, if you can repo&s;e, during the Chri&s;tmas re|ce&s;s.
Embrace my Lady, the young Barone&s;s, and the gentle
Loui&s;a, and in&s;inuate to your &s;ilent Con&s;ort, that &s;eparate letters re|quire
&s;eparate an&s;wers. Had I an air balloon, the great topic of
modern conver&s;ation, I would call upon you till the meeting of Par|liament.

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>December 27th, 1783.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR MADAM</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THE unfortunate are loud and loquacious in their complaints, but
real happine&s;s is content with its own &s;ilent enjoyment; and if
that happine&s;s is of a quiet uniform kind, we &s;uffer days and weeks
to elap&s;e without communicating our &s;en&s;ations to a di&s;tant friend.
By you, therefore, who&s;e temper and under&s;tanding have extracted
from human life on every occa&s;ion the be&s;t and mo&s;t comfortable in|gredients,
my &s;ilence will always be interpreted as an evidence of
content, and you would only be alarmed (the danger is not at
hand) by the too frequent repetition of my letters. Perhaps I
&s;hould have continued to &s;lumber, I don't know how long, had I
not been awakened by the anxiety which you expre&s;s in your la&s;t
letter. * * *</P>
<P>From this ba&s;e &s;ubject I a&s;cend to one which more &s;eriou&s;ly and
&s;trongly engages your thoughts, the con&s;ideration of my health
and happine&s;s. And you will give me credit when I a&s;&s;ure you
with &s;incerity, that I have not repented a &s;ingle moment of the &s;tep
which I have taken, and that I only regret the not having executed
the &s;ame de&s;ign two, or five, or even ten years ago. By this time
I might have returned independant and rich to my native country;
I &s;hould have e&s;caped many di&s;agreeable events that have happened
in the meanwhile, and I &s;hould have avoided the parliamentary life,
which experience has proved to be neither &s;uitable to my temper, nor
conducive to my fortune. In &s;peaking of the happine&s;s which I
enjoy, you will agree with me, in giving the preference to a &s;incere
and &s;en&s;ible friend; and though you cannot di&s;cern the full extent
of his merit, you will ea&s;ily believe that Deyverdun is the man.
<PB N="621" REF="642">
Perhaps two per&s;ons &s;o perfectly fitted to live togethe, were never
ormed by Nature and education. We have both read and &s;een a
great variety of objects; the lights and &s;hades of our different cha|racters
are happily blended, and a friend&s;hip of thirty years has
taught us to enjoy our mutual advantages, and to &s;upport our un|avoidable
imperfections. In love and marriage, &s;ome har&s;h &s;ounds
will &s;ometimes interrupt the harmony, and in the cour&s;e of time,
like our neighbours, we mu&s;t expect &s;ome di&s;agreeable moments;
but confidence and freedom are the two pillars of our union, and I
am much mi&s;taken, if the building be not &s;olid and comfortable.
One di&s;appointment I have indeed experienced, and patiently &s;up|ported.
The family who were &s;ettled in Deyverdun's hou&s;e &s;tarted
&s;ome unexpected difficulties, and will not leave it till the &s;pring; &s;o
that you mu&s;t not yet expect any poetical, or even hi&s;torical, de|&s;cription
of the beauties of my habitation. During the dull months
of winter we are &s;atisfied with a very comfortable apartment in the
middle of the town, and even derive &s;ome advantage from this de|lay;
as it gives us time to arrange &s;ome plans of alteration and fur|niture,
which will embelli&s;h our future and more elegant dwelling.
In this &s;ea&s;on I ri&s;e (not at four in the morning) but a little before
eight; at nine, I am called from my &s;tudy to breakfa&s;t, which I al|ways
perform alone, in the Engli&s;h &s;tile, and, with the aid of
Caplin, I perceive no difference between Lau&s;anne and Bentinck-&s;treet.
Our mornings are u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed in &s;eparate &s;tudies; we
never approach each other's door without a previous me&s;&s;age, or
thrice knocking, and my apartment is already &s;acred and formidable
to &s;trangers. I dre&s;s at half pa&s;t one, and at two (an early hour, to
which I am not perfectly reconciled,) we &s;it down to dinner. We have
hired a female cook, well-&s;killed in her profe&s;&s;ion, and accu&s;tomed to
the ta&s;te of every nation; as for in&s;tance, we had excellent mince-pies
ye&s;terday. After dinner, and the departure of our company, one
two, or three friends, we read together &s;ome amu&s;ing book, or
<PB N="622" REF="643">
play at che&s;s, or retire to our rooms, or make vi&s;its, or go to the
coffee-hou&s;e. Between &s;ix and &s;even the a&s;&s;emblies begin, and I am
oppre&s;&s;ed only with their number and variety. Whi&s;t, at &s;hillings
or half-crowns, is the game I generally play, and I play three rub|bers
with plea&s;ure. Between nine and ten we withdraw to our bread
and cheefe, and friendly conver&s;e, which &s;ends us to bed at eleven;
but the&s;e &s;ober hours are too often interrupted by private or nume|rous
&s;uppers, which I have not the courage to re&s;i&s;t, though I practi&s;e
a laudable ab&s;tinence at the be&s;t furni&s;hed tables. Such is the &s;ke|leton
of my life; it is impo&s;&s;ible to communicate a perfect idea of
the vital and &s;ub&s;tantial parts, the characters of the men and women
with whom I have very ea&s;ily connected my&s;elf in loo&s;er and clo&s;er
bonds, according to their inclination and my own. If I do not de|ceive
my&s;elf and if Deyverdun does not flatter me, I am already a
general favourite; and as our likings and di&s;likes are commonly
mutual, I am equally &s;atisfied with the freedom and elegance of man|ners,
and (after proper allowances and exceptions) with the worthy
and amiable qualities of many individuals. The autumn has been
beautiful, and the winter hitherto mild, but in January we mu&s;t
expect &s;ome &s;evere fro&s;t. In&s;tead of rollings in a coach, I walk the
&s;treets, wrapped up in a fur cloak; but this exerci&s;e is whole&s;ome,
and except an accidental fit of the gout of a few days, I never en|joyed
better health. I am no longer in Pavillard's hou&s;e, where I
was almo&s;t &s;tarved with cold and hunger, and you may be a&s;&s;ured
that I now enjoy every benefit of comfort, plenty, and even decent
luxury. You wi&s;h me happy; acknowledge that &s;uch a life is more
conducive to happine&s;s, than five nights in the week pa&s;&s;ed in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, or five mornings &s;pent at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.
Send me, in return, a fair account of your own &s;ituation in mind
and body. I am &s;atisfied your own good &s;en&s;e would have recon|ciled
you to inevitable &s;eparation; but there never was a more &s;uit|able
diver&s;ion than your vi&s;it to Sheffield-Place. Among the innu|merable
<PB N="623" REF="644">
proofs of friend&s;hip which I have received from that family,
there are none which affect me more &s;en&s;ibly than their kind civilities
to you, though I am per&s;uaded that they are at lea&s;t as much on
your account as on mine. At length Madame de * * *
is delivered by her tyrant's death; her daughter, a valuable woman
of this place, has made &s;ome enquiries, and though her own cir|cum&s;tances
are narrow, &s;he will not &s;uffer her father's widow to be
left totally de&s;titute. I am glad you derived &s;o much melancholy
plea&s;ure from the letters, yet had I known it, I &s;hould have withheld

<P>WITHIN two or three days after your la&s;t <HI>gracious</HI> epi&s;tle, your
complaints were &s;ilenced, and your enquiries were &s;atisfied,
by an ample di&s;patch of four pages, which overflowed the in&s;ide of
the cover, and in which I expo&s;ed my opinions of things in general,
public as well as private, as they exi&s;ted in my mind, in my &s;tate
of ignorance and error, about the eighteenth or twentieth of la&s;t
month. Within a week after that date I epi&s;toli&s;hed, in the &s;ame rich
and copious &s;train, the two venerable females of Newman-&s;treet and
Bath, who&s;e murmurings mu&s;t now be changed into &s;ongs of gra|titude
and applau&s;e. My corre&s;pondence with the holy matron of
Northampton&s;hire has been le&s;s lively and loquacious. You have
not forgotten the author's vindication of him&s;elf from the foul ca|lumnies
of pretended Chri&s;tians. Within a fortnight after his arrival
at Lau&s;anne, he communicated the joyful event to Mrs. E&s;ther Gibbon.
She an&s;wered, <HI>per</HI> return of po&s;t, both letters at the &s;ame time, and
in very dutiful language, almo&s;t excu&s;ing her advice, which was in|tended
<PB N="624" REF="645">
for my &s;piritual, as well as temporal good, and a&s;&s;uring me,
that <HI>nobody &s;hould be able to injure me with her.</HI> Unle&s;s the &s;aint is
an hypocrite, &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t convey a favourable and im|portant
meaning. At all events, it is worth giving <HI>our&s;elves</HI> &s;ome
trouble about her, without indulging any &s;anguine expectations of
inheritance. So much for my females; with regard to my male
corre&s;pondents, you are the only one to whom I have given any
&s;igns of my exi&s;tence, though I have formed many a generous re&s;o|lution.
Yet I am not in&s;en&s;ible of the kind and friendly manner in
which Lord Loughborough has di&s;tingui&s;hed me. He could have
no inducements of intere&s;t, and now that I veiw the di&s;tant picture
with impartial eyes, I am convinced that (for a &s;tate&s;man) he was
&s;incere in his wi&s;hes to &s;erve me. When you &s;ee <HI>him,</HI> the Paynes,
Eden, Crauford, &amp;c. tell them that I am well, happy, and a&s;hamed.
On your &s;ide, the zeal and diligence of your pen has &s;urpri&s;ed and
delighted me, and your letters, at this intere&s;ting moment, are ex|actly
&s;uch as I wi&s;hed them to be&mdash;authentic anecdotes, and rational
&s;peculations, worthy of a man who acts a part in the great theatre,
and who fills a &s;eat, not only in the general Pandaemonium, but in
the private council of the princes of the infernal regions. With
regard to the detail of parliamentary operations, I mu&s;t repeat my
reque&s;t to you, or rather to my Lady, who will now be on the &s;pot,
that &s;he will write, not with her pen, but with her &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and that
after every debate which de&s;erves to pa&s;s the &s;ea and mountains,
&s;he will di&s;&s;ect the faithful narrative of Woodfall, and &s;end it off by
the next po&s;t, as an agreeable &s;upplement to the meagre accounts of
our weekly papers. The wonderful revolutions of la&s;t month have
&s;ounded to my ear more like the &s;hifting &s;cenes of a comedy, or
comic-opera, than like the &s;ober events of real and modern hi&s;tory;
and the irregularity of our winter po&s;ts, which &s;ometimes retarded,
and &s;ometimes ha&s;tened, the arrival of the di&s;patches, has increa&s;ed
the confu&s;ion of our ideas. Surely the Lord has blinded the eyes
<PB N="625" REF="646">
of Pharoah and of his &s;ervants; the ob&s;tinacy of la&s;t &s;pring was
nothings compared to the head&s;trong and headlong madne&s;s of this
winter. I expect with much impatience the fir&s;t days of your
meeting; the purity and integrity of the coalition will &s;uffer a fiery
trial; but if they are true to them&s;elves and to each other, a ma|jority
of the Hou&s;e of Commons mu&s;t prevail; the rebellion of the
young gentlemen will be cru&s;hed, and the ma&s;ters will re&s;ume the
government of the &s;chool. After the addre&s;s and an&s;wer, I have
no conception that Parliament can be di&s;&s;olved during the &s;e&s;&s;ion;
but if the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try can outlive the &s;torm, I think the death-warrant
will infallibly be &s;igned in the &s;ummer. <HI>Here</HI> I blu&s;h for
my country, without confe&s;&s;ing her &s;hame. Fox acted like a man
of honour, yet &s;urely his union with Pitt affords the only hope of
&s;alvation. How mi&s;erably are we wa&s;ting the &s;ea&s;on of peace!</P>
<P>I have written three pages before I come to my own bu&s;ine&s;s and
feelings. In the fir&s;t place, I mo&s;t &s;incerely rejoice that I left the
&s;hip, and &s;wam a&s;hore on a plank: the daily and hourly agitation
in which I mu&s;t have lived would have made me truly mi&s;erable;
and if I had obtained a place during plea&s;ure, * * *, for
in&s;tance? On the fir&s;t news of the di&s;&s;olution, I con&s;idered my &s;eat
as &s;o totally and irrecoverably gone, that I have been le&s;s afflicted
with * * *'s ob&s;tinacy. * * *
On this occa&s;ion remember you are acting for a <HI>poor</HI> friend; di&s;mi&s;s
a little of the &s;pirit of faction and patrioti&s;m, and &s;toop to a pru|dential
line of conduct, which in your own ca&s;e you might po&s;&s;ibly
di&s;dain. * * *
Perhaps you will abu&s;e my prudence and patrioti&s;m, when I inform
you, that I have already ve&s;ted a part (thirty thou&s;and livres, about
one thou&s;and three hundred puunds) in the new loan of the King of
France. I get eight <HI>per cent.</HI> on the joint lives of Deyverdun and
<PB N="626" REF="647">
my&s;elf, be&s;ides thirty tickets in a very advantageous lottery, of which
the highe&s;t prize is an annuity of forty thou&s;and livres (one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred pounds) a year. At this moment, the beginning of
a peace, and probably a long peace, I think (and the world &s;eems
to think) the French funds at lea&s;t as &s;olid as our own, I have em|powered
my agent, M. de Le&s;&s;art, a capital banker at Paris, to draw
upon Go&s;ling for the money two months hence; and to avoid all
accidents that may re&s;ult from untoward delays, and mercantile
churli&s;hne&s;s, I expect that you will &s;upport my credit in Fleet-&s;treet
with you own more re&s;pectable name. * * *
What &s;ay you now? Am I not a wi&s;e man? My letter is enormous,
and the po&s;t on the wing. In a few days I will write to my Lady
her&s;elf, and enter &s;omething more into the details of dome&s;tic life.
Suffice it to &s;ay, that the &s;cene becomes each day more plea&s;ant
and comfortable, and that I complain only of the di&s;&s;ipation of
Lau&s;anne. In the cour&s;e of March or April we &s;hall take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Deyverdun's hou&s;e. My books, which, by &s;ome &s;trange
neglect, did not leave Paris till the third of this month, will arrive
in a few weeks; and I &s;hall &s;oon re&s;ume the continuation of my
Hi&s;tory, which I &s;hall pro&s;ecute with the more vigour, as the com|pletion
affords me a di&s;tant pro&s;pect of a vi&s;it to England. Adieu.
Ever yours.</P>

<P>AFTER my la&s;t enormous di&s;patch, nothing can remain, except
&s;ome &s;mall gleanings, or occa&s;ional hints; and thus in order:
I am not con&s;cious that any of your valuable MSS. have mi&s;carried,
or that I have omitted to an&s;wer any e&s;&s;ential particulars. They
<PB N="627" REF="648">
&s;tand in my bureau carefully arranged, and docketed under the fol|lowing
dates; September twenty-three, October twenty-three, No|vember
eighteen, December two, December fifteen, December nine|teen,
December twenty-three, December twenty-nine, January &s;ixteen,
which la&s;t I have received this day, February 2d. For greater per|&s;picuity,
it will not be ami&s;s (on either &s;ide) to number our future
epi&s;tles, by a con&s;picuous Roman character in&s;cribed in the front, to
which we may at any time refer. But in&s;tead of writing by O&s;tend,
the &s;horter and &s;urer way, e&s;pecially on all occa&s;ions that de&s;erve cele|rity,
will be to inclo&s;e them to my banker, M. de Le&s;&s;art at Paris, who
will forward them to me. Through Germany the pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea is
more uncertain, the roads wor&s;e, and the di&s;tance greater: we
often complain of delay and irregularity at this intere&s;ting moment.
By your la&s;t I find that you have boldly and generou&s;ly opened a
treaty with the enemy, which I propo&s;ed with fear and he&s;itation.
I impatiently expect the re&s;ult; and again repeat, that <HI>whatever</HI> you
can obtain for * * *, I &s;hall con&s;ider it as &s;o much &s;aved
out of the fire, &amp;c. &amp;c. Do you remember Dunning's motion (in
the year 1780) to addre&s;s the Crown again&s;t a di&s;&s;olution of Par|liament;
a &s;imple addre&s;s we rejected, as an infringement on the
prerogative? yet how far &s;hort of the&s;e &s;trong democratical mea|&s;ures,
for which you have probably voted, as I &s;hould probably have
done: &s;uch is the contagion of party. Fox drives mo&s;t furiou&s;ly,
yet I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed if Pitt's moderation and character
&s;hould in&s;en&s;ibly win the nation, and even the Hou&s;e, to e&s;pou&s;e
his cau&s;e. * * *
Unle&s;s when I look back on England with a &s;elfi&s;h or a tender re|gard,
my hours roll away very plea&s;antly, and I can again repeat
with truth, that I have not regretted one &s;ingle moment the &s;tep
which I have taken. We are now at the height of the winter
di&s;&s;ipation, and I am peculiarly happy when I can &s;teal away from
<PB N="628" REF="649">
great a&s;&s;emblies, and &s;uppers of twenty or thirty people, to a more
private party of &s;ome of tho&s;e per&s;ons whom I begin to call my
friends. Till we are &s;ettled in our hou&s;e little can be expected on
our &s;ide; yet I have already given two or three hand&s;ome dinners;
and though every thing is grown dearer, I am not alarmed at the
general view of my expence. Deyverdun &s;alutes you; and we are
agreed that few married couples are better entitled to the flitch of
bacon than we &s;hall be at the end of the year. When I had written
about half this epi&s;tle my books arrived: at our fir&s;t meeting all was
rapture and confu&s;ion, and two or three po&s;ts, from the &s;econd to
this day, the fourteenth, have been &s;uffered to depart unnoticed.
Your letter of the twenty-&s;eventh of January, which was not re|ceived
till ye&s;terday, has again awakened me, and I thought the
&s;ure&s;t way would be to &s;end off this &s;ingle &s;heet without any farther
delay.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely rejoice in the &s;tability of Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;uppo&s;ition was founded on Mr. Banks's declaration in the name of Mr. Pitt.</NOTE>; and the fir&s;t

<P>ALAS! alas! alas! We may now exchange our mutual condo|lence.
La&s;t Chri&s;tmas, on the change of admini&s;tration, I was
&s;truck with the thunderbolt of the unexpected event, and in the ap|proaching
<PB N="629" REF="650">
di&s;&s;olution I &s;ore&s;aw the lo&s;s of * * *.
The long continuance and various changes
of the tempe&s;t rendered me by degrees callous and in&s;en&s;ible; when
the art of the mariners was exhau&s;ted I felt that we were &s;inking&punc;
I expected the &s;hip to founder, and when the fatal moment arrived,
I was even plea&s;ed to be delivered from hope and fear, to the calm|ne&s;s
of de&s;pair. I now turn my eyes, not on the pa&s;t, but on the
pre&s;ent and the future; what is lo&s;t I try to con&s;ider as if it never
had exi&s;ted; and every day I congratulate my own good fortune,
let me &s;ay my prudence and re&s;olution, in migrating from your noi&s;y
&s;tage to a &s;cene of repo&s;e and content. But even in this &s;eparate
&s;tate, I was &s;till anxious for my friend upon Engli&s;h earth, and at
fir&s;t was much delighted with your hint, that you were &s;etting off
for Coventry, without any pro&s;pect of an oppo&s;ition. Every po&s;t,
Wedne&s;days and Saturdays, I eagerly looked for the intelligence of
your victory; and in &s;pite of my mi&s;behaviour, which I do not
deny, I mu&s;t abu&s;e <HI>my Lady,</HI> rather than you, for leaving me in &s;o
painful a &s;ituation. Each day rai&s;ed and increa&s;ed my apprehen&s;ion;
the <HI>Courier de l' Europe</HI> fir&s;t announced the conte&s;t, the Engli&s;h papers
proclaimed your defeat, and your la&s;t letter, which I received four
days ago, &s;hewed me that you exerted fir&s;t the &s;pirit, and at la&s;t the
temper of an hero. I am not much &s;urpri&s;ed that you &s;hould have
been &s;wept away in the general unpopularity, &s;ince even in this
quiet place, your friends are con&s;idered as a factious crew, acting in
direct oppo&s;ition both to the King and people. For your&s;elf I am
at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay. If this repul&s;e &s;hould teach you to renounce
all connection with Kings and Mini&s;ters, and Patriots and Parties,
and Parliaments; for all of which you are by many degrees too
hone&s;t; I &s;hould exclaim, with Teague of re&s;pectable memory,
<Q>By my &s;houl, dear joy, you have <HI>gained</HI> a lo&s;s.</Q> Private life,
whether contemplative or active, has &s;urely more &s;olid and inde|pendent
charms; you have <HI>&s;ome</HI> dome&s;tic comforts; Sheffield-Place
<PB N="630" REF="651">
is &s;till &s;u&s;ceptible of u&s;eful and ornamental improvements, (alas!
how much better might even the la&s;t * * * have been laid out!)
and if the&s;e cares are not &s;ufficient to occupy your lei&s;ure, I can
tru&s;t your re&s;tle&s;s and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit to find new methods to pre|&s;erve
you from the in&s;ipidity of repo&s;e. But I much fear your di&s;|content
and regret at being excluded from that Pandaemonium which
we have &s;o often cur&s;ed, as long as you were obliged to attend it.
The leaders of the party will flatter you with the opinion of their
friend&s;hip and your own importance; the warmith of your temper
makes you credulous and un&s;u&s;picious; and, like the re&s;t of our
&s;pecies, male and female, you are not ab&s;olutely deaf to the voice of
prai&s;e. Some other place will be &s;ugge&s;ted, ea&s;y, honourable, cer|tain,
where nothing is wanted but a man of character and &s;pirit to
head a &s;uperior intere&s;t; the oppo&s;ition, if any, is contemptible, and
the expence cannot be large. You will go down, find almo&s;t every
circum&s;tance fal&s;ely &s;tated, repent that you had engaged your&s;elf,
but you cannot de&s;ert tho&s;e friends who are firmly attached to your
cau&s;e; be&s;ides, the money you have already &s;pent would have been
thrown away; another thou&s;and will complete the bu&s;ine&s;s: deeper
and deeper will you plunge, and the la&s;t evil will be wor&s;e than the
fir&s;t. You &s;ee I am a free-&s;poken coun&s;ellor; may I not be a true
prophet! Did I con&s;ult my own wi&s;hes, I &s;hould ob&s;erve to you,
that as you are no longer a &s;lave, you might &s;oon be tran&s;ported, as
you &s;eem to de&s;ire, to one of the Alpine hills. The purity and
calmne&s;s of the air is the be&s;t calculated to allay the heat of a poli|tical
fever; the education of the two Prince&s;&s;es might be &s;ucce&s;sfully
conducted under your eye and that of my Lady; and if you had
re&s;olution to determine on a re&s;idence, not a vi&s;it, at Lau&s;anne, your
worldly affairs might repo&s;e them&s;elves after their late fatigues. But
you know that <HI>I</HI> am a friend to toleration, and am always di&s;po&s;ed to
make the large&s;t allowance for the different natures of animals; a lion
and a lamb, an eagle and a worm. I am afraid we are too quiet for
<PB N="631" REF="652">
you; here it would not be ea&s;y for you to create any bu&s;ine&s;s; you
have for &s;ome time neglected books, and I doubt whether you would
not think our &s;uppers and a&s;&s;emblies &s;omewhat trifling and in&s;ipid.
You are far more difficult than I am; you are in &s;earch of knowledge,
and you are not content with your company, unle&s;s you can derive
from them information or extraordinary amu&s;ement. For my part,
I like to draw information from books, and I am &s;atisfied with
polite attention and ea&s;y manners. Finally, I am happy to tell, and
you will be happy to hear, that this place has in every re&s;pect ex|ceeded
my be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes. How often have you
&s;aid, as often as I expre&s;&s;ed any ill-humour again&s;t the hurry, the
expence, and the precarious condition of my London life, <Q>Ay,
that is a non&s;en&s;ical &s;cheme of retiring to Lau&s;anne that you have
got into your head, a pretty fancy; you remember how much you
liked it in your youth, but you have now &s;een more of the world,
and if you were to try it again, you would find your&s;elf woefully
di&s;appointed?</Q> I had it in my head, in my heart, I have tried it,
I have not been di&s;appointed, and my knowledge of the world has
&s;erved only to convince me, that a capital and a crowd may contain
much le&s;s real &s;ociety, than the &s;mall circle of this gentle retirement.
The winter has been longer, but, as far as I can learn, le&s;s rigorous
than in the re&s;t of Europe. The &s;pring is now bur&s;ting upon us,
and in our own garden it is di&s;played in all its glory. I already oc|cupy
a temporary apartment, and we live in the lower part of the
hou&s;e; before you receive this we &s;hall be in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We
have much to enjoy and &s;omething to do, which I take to be the
happie&s;t condition of human life. Now for bu&s;ine&s;s, the kind of
&s;ubject which I always undertake with the mo&s;t reluctance, and leave
with the mo&s;t plea&s;ure. * * *
Adieu.</P>
<P><PB N="632" REF="653">
And now, my Lady,</P>
<P>LET me approach your gentle, not grimalkin, pre&s;ence, with
deep remor&s;e. You have indirectly been informed of my &s;tate of
mind and body; (the whole winter I have not had the &s;lighte&s;t re|turn
of the gout, or any other complaint what&s;oever;) you have
been appri&s;ed, and are now appri&s;ed, of my motions, or rather of
my perfect and agreeable repo&s;e; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s (and I <HI>feel</HI>)
that &s;omething of a direct and per&s;onal exchange of &s;entiment has
been neglected on my &s;ide, though I &s;till <HI>per&s;uade</HI> my&s;elf that when
I am &s;ettled in my new hou&s;e I &s;hall have more &s;ubject, as well
as lei&s;ure, to write. Such tricks of lazine&s;s your active &s;pirit is
a &s;tranger to, though Mrs. * * * complains that &s;he has never
had an an&s;wer to her la&s;t letters. Poor Lady Pembroke! <HI>you</HI> will
feel for her; after a cruel alternative of hope and fear, her only
daughter, Lady Charlotte, died at <HI>Aix en Provence;</HI> they have per|&s;uaded
her to come to this place, where &s;he is intimately connected
with the Cerjat family. She has taken an agreeable hou&s;e, about
three miles from the town, and lives retired. I have &s;een her; her
behaviour is calm, but her affliction&mdash;. I accept with gratitude
your friendly propo&s;al of Wedgewood's ware, and &s;hould be glad to
have it bought and packed, and &s;ent without delay through Ger|many;
and I &s;hall only &s;ay, that I wi&s;h to have a very complete
&s;ervice for two cour&s;es and a de&s;ert, and that our &s;uppers are nu|merous,
frequently fifteen or twenty per&s;ons. Adieu. I do not
mean this as your letter. You are very good to poor Kitty. With
you I do not condole about Coventry.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>May 28th, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEGIN without preface or apology, as if I had received your
letter by the la&s;t po&s;t. In my own defence I know not what to
&s;ay; but if I were di&s;po&s;ed to recriminate, I might ob&s;erve that you
your&s;elf are not perfectly free from the &s;in of lazine&s;s and procra&s;ti|nation.
I have often wondered why we are not fonder of letter-writing.
We all delight to talk of our&s;elves, and it is only in letters,
in writing to a friend, that we can enjoy that conver&s;ation, not only
without reproach or interruption, but with the highe&s;t propriety
and mutual &s;atisfaction; &s;ure that the per&s;on whom we addre&s;s feels
an equal, or at lea&s;t a &s;trong and lively intere&s;t in the con&s;ideration
of the plea&s;ing &s;ubject. On the &s;ubject therefore of <HI>&s;elf</HI> I will en|tertain
a friend, to whom none of my thoughts or actions, none of
my pains or plea&s;ures, can ever be indifferent. When I fir&s;t che|ri&s;hed
the de&s;ign of retiring to Lau&s;anne, I was much more appre|hen&s;ive
of wounding your tender attachment, than of offending
Lord Sheffield's manly and vehement friend&s;hip. In the abolition
of the Board of Trade the motives for my retreat became more
urgent and forcible; I wi&s;hed to break loo&s;e, yet I delayed above a
year before I could take my final re&s;olution; and the letter in which
I di&s;clo&s;ed it to you co&s;t me one of the mo&s;t painful &s;truggles of my
life. As &s;oon as I had conquered that difficulty, all meaner ob&s;tacles
fell before me, and in a few weeks I found my&s;elf at Lau&s;anne,
a&s;toni&s;hed at my firmne&s;s and my &s;ucce&s;s. Perhaps you &s;till blame
or &s;till lament the &s;tep which I have taken. If on your own ac|count,
I can only &s;ympathize with your feelings, the recollection
of which often co&s;ts me a &s;igh: if on mine, let me fairly &s;tate what
<PB N="634" REF="655">
I have e&s;caped in England, and what I have found at Lau&s;anne.
Recollect the tempe&s;ts of this winter, how many anxious days I
&s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed, how many noi&s;y, turbulent, hot, unwhole&s;ome
nights, while my political exi&s;tence, and that of my friends, was at
&s;take; yet the&s;e feeble efforts would have been unavailing; I &s;hould
have lo&s;t my &s;eat in parliament, and after the extraordinary expence of
another year, I mu&s;t &s;till have pur&s;ued the road of Switzerland, unle&s;s
I had been tempted by &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h patron, or by Lord S.'s a&s;piring
&s;pirit, to incur a mo&s;t inconvenient expence for a new &s;eat; and
once more, at the beginning of an oppo&s;ition, to engage in new
&s;cenes of bu&s;ine&s;s. As to the immediate pro&s;pect of any thing like
a quiet and profitable retreat, I &s;hould not know where to look; my
friends are no longer in power. With * * * and his party I
have no connection; and were he di&s;po&s;ed to favour a man of
letters, it is difficult to &s;ay what he could give, or what I would ac|cept;
the reign of pen&s;ions and &s;inecures is at an end, and a com|mi&s;&s;ion
in the Exci&s;e or Cu&s;toms, the &s;ummit of my hopes, would
give me income at the expence of lei&s;ure and liberty. When I re|volve
the&s;e circum&s;tances in my mind, my only regret, I repeat it
again and again, is, that I did not embrace this &s;alutary mea&s;ure
three, five, ten years ago. Thus much I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;ay, and &s;hall now di&s;mi&s;s this unplea&s;ing part of the &s;ubject.
For my &s;ituation here, health is the fir&s;t con&s;ideration; and on that
head your tenderne&s;s had conceived &s;ome degree of anxiety. I
know not whether it has reached you that I had a &s;it of the gout
the day after my arrival. The deed is true, but the cau&s;e was acci|dental;
carele&s;sly &s;tepping down a flight of &s;tairs, I &s;prained my
ancle; and my ungenerous enemy in&s;tantly took advantage of my
weakne&s;s. But &s;ince my breaking that double chain, I have enjoyed
a winter of the mo&s;t perfect health that I have perhaps ever known,
without any mixture of the little flying incommodities which in my
be&s;t days have &s;ometimes di&s;turbed the tranquillity of my Engli&s;h
<PB N="635" REF="656">
life. You are not ignorant of Dr. Ti&s;&s;ot's reputation, and his merit
is even above his reputation. He a&s;&s;ures me, that in his opinion, the
moi&s;ture of England and Holland is mo&s;t pernicious; the dry pure
air of Switzerland mo&s;t favourable to a gouty con&s;titution: that ex|perience
ju&s;tifies the theory; and that there are fewer martyrs of that
di&s;order in this, than in any other country in Europe. This winter
has every where been mo&s;t uncommonly &s;evere: and you &s;eem in
England to have had your full &s;hare of the general hard&s;hip: but in
this corner, &s;urrounded by the Alps, it has rather been long than
rigorous; and its duration &s;tole away our &s;pring, and left us no
interval between furs and &s;ilks. We now enjoy the genial influence
of the climate and the &s;ea&s;on; and no &s;tation was ever more calcu|lated
to enjoy them than Deyverdun's hou&s;e and garden, which are
now become my own. You will not expect that the pen &s;hould de|&s;cribe
what the pencil would imperfectly delineate. A few circum|&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">y, however, be mentioned. My library is about the &s;ame
&s;ize <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 words"> in Bentinck-&s;treet, with this difference, however, that
in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">king on a paved court, twelve feet &s;quare, I command
a boundles pro&s;pect of vale, mountain, and water, from my three
windows. My apartment is completed by a &s;pacious light clo&s;et, or
&s;tore-room, with a bed-chamber and dre&s;&s;ing-room. Deyverdun's
habitation is plea&s;ant and convenient, though le&s;s exten&s;ive: for our
common u&s;e we have a very hand&s;ome winter apartment of four
rooms; and on the ground-floor, two cool &s;aloons for the &s;ummer,
with a &s;ufficiency, or rather &s;uperfluity, of offices, &amp;c. A terrace,
one hundred yards long, extends beyond the front of the hou&s;e, and
leads to a clo&s;e impenetrable &s;hrubbery; and from thence the circuit
of a long and various walk carries me round a meadow and vine|yard.
The intervals afford abundant &s;upply of fruit, and every &s;ort
of vegetables; and if you add, that this villa (which has been much
ornamented by my friend) touches the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ociable part of
the town, you will agree with me, that few per&s;ons, either princes
<PB N="636" REF="657">
or philo&s;ophers, enjoy a more de&s;irable re&s;idence. Deyverdun,
who is proud of his own works, often walks me round, pointing out,
with acknowledgment and enthu&s;ia&s;m, the beauties that change with
every &s;tep and with every variation of light. I &s;hare, or at lea&s;t I &s;ym|pathize
with his plea&s;ure. He appears contented with my progre&s;s,
and has already told &s;everal people, that he does not de&s;pair of making
me a gardener. Be that as it may, you will be glad to hear that I am,
by my own choice, infinitely more in motion, and in the open air,
than I ever have been formerly; yet my perfect liberty and lei&s;ure
leave me many &s;tudious hours; and as the circle of our acquaintance
retire into the country, I &s;hall be much le&s;s engaged in company and
diver&s;ion. I have &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;umed the pro&s;ecution of my Hi&s;tory;
each day and each month adds &s;omething to the completion of the
great work. The progre&s;s is &s;low, the labour continual, and the
end remote and uncertain; yet every day brings its amu&s;ement, as
well as labour; and though I dare not fix a term, even in my own
fancy, I advance, with the plea&s;ing reflection, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of pub|lication
(&s;hould I be detained here &s;o long) mu&s;t enforce my return
to England, and re&s;tore me to the be&s;t of mothers and friends. In
the mean while, with health and competence, a full independence of
mind and action, a delightful habitation, a true friend, and many
plea&s;ant acquaintance; you will allow, that I am rather an object of
envy than of pity; and if you were more conver&s;ant with the u&s;e of the
French language, I would &s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;e to you to repo&s;e your&s;elf
with us in this fine country. My indirect intelligence (on which
I &s;ometimes depend with more implicit faith than on the kind di&s;&s;imu|lation
of your friend&s;hip) gives me rea&s;on to hope that the la&s;t winter
has been more favourable to your health than the preceding one.
A&s;&s;ure me of it your&s;elf hone&s;tly and truly, and you will afford me
one of the mo&s;t lively plea&s;ures.</P>

<P>SINCE my retreat to Lau&s;anne our corre&s;pondence has never re|ceived
&s;o long an interruption; and as I have been equally taci|turn
with the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h world, it may now be a problem
among that &s;ceptical nation, whether the Hi&s;torian of the Decline
and Fall be a living &s;ub&s;tance or an empty name. So tremendous
is the &s;leepy power of lazine&s;s and habit, that the &s;ilence of each
po&s;t operated &s;till more &s;trongly to benumb the hand, and to freeze the
<HI>epi&s;tolary</HI> ink. How or when I &s;hould have naturally awakened, I can|not
<PB N="638" REF="659">
tell; but the pre&s;&s;ure of my affairs, and the arrival of your la&s;t
letter, compel me to remember that you are entru&s;ted with the final
amputation of the be&s;t limb of my property. The &s;ubject is in
it&s;elf &s;o painful, that I have po&s;tponed it, like a child's phy&s;ic, from
day to day; and lo&s;ing whole mornings, as I walked about my
library, in u&s;ele&s;s regret and impotent re&s;olution, you will be amazed
to hear that (after peeping to &s;ee if you are all well, and returned
from Ireland) I have not yet had the courage to peru&s;e your letter,
for fear of meeting with &s;ome gloomy intelligence; and I will now
fini&s;h what I have to &s;ay of pecuniary matters, before I know whe|ther
its contents will fortify or overthrow my unbia&s;&s;ed &s;entiments.
* * *
To what purpo&s;e (will you &s;ay) are the&s;e
tardy and u&s;ele&s;s repinings? To arraign your manager? No, I am
&s;atisfied with the &s;kill and firmne&s;s of the pilot, and complain only
of the untoward violence of the tempe&s;t. To repent of your re|treat
into Switzerland? No, &s;urely, every &s;ub&s;equent event has
tended to make it as nece&s;&s;ary as it has proved agreeable. Why
then the&s;e lamentations? Hear and attend&mdash;It is to intere&s;t (if
po&s;&s;ible more &s;trongly) your zeal and friend&s;hip, to ju&s;tify a &s;ort of
avarice, a love of money, very &s;oreign to my character, but with
which I cling to the&s;e la&s;t fragments of my fortune. * * *
As far as I can judge from the experience of a year, though I find
Lau&s;anne much more expen&s;ive than I imagined, yet my &s;tile of
living (and a very hand&s;ome &s;tile it is) will be brought <HI>nearly</HI> within
my ordinary revenues. I wi&s;h our poor country could &s;ay as much!
But it was always my favourite and rational wi&s;h, that at the wind|ing
up of my affairs I might po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;um, from one to two thou|&s;and
pounds, neither buried in land, nor locked up in the funds, but
free, light, and ready to obey any call of intere&s;t, or plea&s;ure, or
virtue; to defray any extraordinary expence, &s;upport any delay, or
<PB N="639" REF="660">
remove any ob&s;tacle. For the attainment of this object, I tru&s;t in
your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. * * *
Thus much for this
money tran&s;action; to you I need add no other &s;timulative, than
to &s;ay that my ea&s;e and comfort very much depend on the &s;ucce&s;s of
this plan.</P>
<P>As I thought every man of &s;en&s;e and fortune in Ireland mu&s;t be
&s;atisfied, I did not conceive the cloud &s;o dark as you repre&s;ent it.
I will &s;eriou&s;ly peru&s;e the 8vo. and in due time the 4to. edi|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of Ob&s;ervations on the Commerce with the American States.</NOTE>.
it would become a cla&s;&s;ic book, if you could find lei&s;ure
(will you ever find it?) to introduce order and ornament. You
mu&s;t negociate <HI>directly</HI> with Deyverdun; but the &s;tate will not hear
of parting with their only Reynolds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Alluding to his portrait.</NOTE> I embrace my Lady; let
her be angry, provided &s;he be well. Adieu. Yours.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> The care of Ireland may have amu&s;ed you in the &s;ummer;
but how do you mean to employ the winter? Do you not ca&s;t a long|ing,
lingering look at St. Stephen's chapel? With your fiery &s;pirit,
and firm judgment, I almo&s;t wi&s;h you there; not for your benefit,
but for the public. If you re&s;olve to recover your &s;eat, do not
li&s;ten to any fallacious and infinite projects of intere&s;t, conte&s;t, re|turn,
petition, &amp;c. but limit your expence.</P>

<P>A FEW weeks ago, as I was walking on our terrace with M. Ti&s;&s;ot,
the celebrated phy&s;ician; M. Mercier, the author of the <HI>Tableau
de Paris;</HI> the Abb&eacute; Raynal; Mon&s;ieur, Madame, and Mademoi&s;elle
<PB N="640" REF="661">
Necker; the Abb&eacute; de Bourbon, a natural &s;on of Lewis the Fifteenth,
the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, Prince Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia, and a
dozen Counts, Barons, and extraordinary per&s;ons, among whom was
a natural &s;on of the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia&mdash;Are you &s;atisfied with this
lift? which I could enlarge and embelli&s;h, without departing from
truth; and was not the Baron of Sheffield (profound as he is on
the &s;ubject of the American trade) doubly mi&s;taken with regard to
Gibbon and Lau&s;anne? Whenever I u&s;ed to hint my de&s;ign of retir|ing,
that illu&s;trious Baron, after a proper effu&s;ion of d&mdash;d fools,
conde&s;cended to ob&s;erve, that &s;uch an ob&s;cure nook in Switzerland
might plea&s;e me in the ignorance of youth, but that after ta&s;ting for
&s;o many years the various &s;ociety of Paris and London, I &s;hould
&s;oon be tired with the dull and uniform round of a provincial town.
In the winter, Lau&s;anne is indeed reduced to its native powers; but
during the &s;ummer, it is po&s;&s;ibly, after Spa, one of the mo&s;t fa|vourite
places of general re&s;ort. The tour of Switzerland, the Alps,
and the Glaciers, is become a fa&s;hion. Ti&s;&s;ot attracts the invalids,
e&s;pecially from France; and a colony of Engli&s;h have taken up the
habit of &s;pending their winters at Nice, and their &s;ummers in the
Pays de Vaud. Such are the &s;plendour and variety of our &s;ummer
vi&s;itors; and <HI>you</HI> will agree with me more readily than the Baron,
when I &s;ay that this variety, in&s;tead of being a merit, is, in my
opinion, one of the very few objections to the re&s;idence of Lau|&s;anne.
After the di&s;&s;ipation of the winter I expected to have en|joyed,
with more freedom and &s;olitude, my&s;elf, my friend, my
books, and this delicious paradi&s;e; but my po&s;ition and character
make me here a &s;ort of a public character, and oblige me to &s;ee and
be &s;een. However, it is my firm re&s;olution for next &s;ummer to
a&s;&s;ume the independence of a philo&s;opher, and to be vi&s;ible only to the
per&s;ons whom I like. On the principle I &s;hould not, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly,
have avoided the Neckers and Prince Henry. The former have
purcha&s;ed the barony of Copet near Geneva; and as the buildings
<PB N="641" REF="662">
were very much out of repair, they pa&s;&s;ed this &s;ummer at a country|hou&s;e
at the gates of Lau&s;anne. They afford a new example, that
per&s;ons who have ta&s;ted of greatne&s;s can &s;eldom return with plea|&s;ure
to a private &s;tation. In the moments when we were alone he
conver&s;ed with me freely, and I believe truly, on the &s;ubject of his
admini&s;tration and fall; and has opened &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of modern
hi&s;tory, which would make a very good figure in <HI>the</HI> American
book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervation on the Commerce with the American States.</NOTE> If they &s;pent the &s;ummers at the ca&s;tle of Copet, about
nine leagues from hence, a fortnight or three weeks vi&s;it would be a
plea&s;ant and healthful excur&s;ion; but, alas! I fear there is little ap|pearance
of its being executed. <HI>Her</HI> health is impaired by the agi|tation
of her mind: in&s;tead of returning to Paris, &s;he is ordered to
pa&s;s the winter in the &s;outhern provinces of France, and our la&s;t
parting was &s;olemn; as I very much doubt whether I &s;hall ever
&s;ee her again. They have now a very trouble&s;ome charge, which
you will exeprience in a few years, the di&s;po&s;al of a Barone&s;s; Ma|demoi&s;elle<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Now Madame de Staal.</NOTE>
Necker, one of the greate&s;t heire&s;&s;es in Europe, is now
about eighteen, wild, vain, but good-natured, and with a much larger
provi&s;ion of wit than of beauty: what increa&s;es their difficulties is
their religious ob&s;tinacy of marrying her only to a prote&s;tant. It
would be an excellent opportunity for a young Engli&s;hman of a great
name and a fair reputation. Prince Henry mu&s;t be a man of &s;en&s;e;
for he took more notice, and expre&s;&s;ed more e&s;teem for me, than
any body el&s;e. He is certainly (without touching his military
character) a very lively and entertaining companion. He talked
with freedom, and generally with contempt, of mo&s;t of the princes
of Europe; with re&s;pect of the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, but never men|tioned
the name of his brother, except once, when he hinted that
it was <HI>he him&s;elf</HI> that won the battle of Ro&s;bach. His nephew, and
<PB N="642" REF="663">
our nephew, the hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick is here for his edu|cation.
Of the Engli&s;h, who live very much as a national colony,
you will like to hear of Mrs. Fra&s;er and <HI>one</HI> more. Donna Cathe|rian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Honourable Mrs. Fra&s;er.</NOTE>
plea&s;es every body, by the perfect &s;implicity of her &s;tate of
nature. You know &s;he has had re&s;olution to return from England
(where &s;he told me &s;he &s;aw you) to Lau&s;anne, for the &s;ake of Mi&s;s
Bri&s;tow, who is in bad health, and in a few days they &s;et off for
Nice. <HI>The other</HI> is the Eliza; &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through Lau&s;anne, in her
road from Italy to England; poorly in health, but &s;till adorable,
(nay, do not frown!) and I enjoyed &s;ome delightful hours by her
bed-&s;ide. She wrote me a line from Paris, but has not executed her
promi&s;e of vi&s;iting Lau&s;anne in the month of October. My pen
has run much fa&s;ter, and much farther, than I intended on the &s;ub|ject
of other; yet, in de&s;cribing them, I have thrown &s;ome light
over my&s;elf and my &s;ituation. A year, a very &s;hort one, has now
clap&s;ed &s;ince my arrival at Lau&s;anne; and after a cool review of my
&s;entiments, I can &s;incerely declare, that I have never, during a &s;ingle
moment, repented of having executed my <HI>ob&s;urd</HI> project of retiring to
Lau&s;anne. It is needle&s;s to dwell on the fatigue, the hurry, the vexa|tion
which I mu&s;t have felt in the narrow and dirty circle of Engli&s;h
politics. My pre&s;ent life wants no foil, and &s;hines by its own na|tive
light. The cho&s;en part of my library is now arrived, and ar|ranged
in a room full as good as that in Bentinck-&s;treet, with this
difference indeed, that in&s;tead of looking on a &s;tone court, twelve
feet &s;quare, I command, from three windows of plate-gla&s;s, an un|bounded
pro&s;pect of many a league of vineyard, of fields, of wood,
of lake, and of mountains; a &s;cene which Lord Sheffield will tell
you is &s;uperior to all you can imagine. The climate, though &s;evere
in winter, has perfectly agreed with my con&s;titution, and the year
is accompli&s;hed without any return of the gout. An excellent
<PB N="643" REF="664">
hou&s;e, a good table, a plea&s;ant garden, are no contemptible ingre|dients
in human happine&s;s. The general &s;tyle of &s;ociety hits my
&s;ancy; I have cultivated a large and agrecable circle of acquaintance,
and I am much deceived if I have not laid the foundations of two
or three more intimate and valuable connections; but their names
would be indifferent, and it would require pages, or rather volumes,
to de&s;cribe their per&s;ons and characters. With regard to my &s;tand|ing
di&s;h, my dome&s;tic friend, I could not be much di&s;appointed,
after an intimacy of eight-and-twenty years. His heart and his
head are excellent; he has the warme&s;t attachment for me, he is &s;a|tisfied
that I have the &s;ame for him: &s;ome &s;light imperfections mu&s;t be
mutually &s;upported; two bachelors, who have lived &s;o long alone and
independent, have their peculiar fancies and humours, and when the
ma&s;k of form and ceremony is laid a&s;ide, every moment in a family-life
has not the &s;weetne&s;s of the honey-moon, even between the
hu&s;bands and wives who have the true&s;t and mo&s;t tender regard for
each other. Should you be very much &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of my
being married? Amazing as it may &s;eem, I do a&s;&s;ure you that the
event is le&s;s improbable than it would have appeared to my&s;elf a
twelvemonth ago. Deyverdun and I have often agreed, in je&s;t and
in earne&s;t, that a hou&s;e like ours would be regulated, and graced,
and enlivened, by an agreeable female companion; but each of us
&s;eems de&s;irous that his friend &s;hould &s;acrifice him&s;elf for the public
good. Since my re&s;idence here I have lived much in women's com|pany;
and, to your credit be it &s;poken, I like you the better the
more I &s;ee of you. Not that I am in love with any particular per|&s;on.
I have di&s;covered about half-a-dozen <HI>wives</HI> who would plea&s;e
me in different ways, and by various merits: one as a mi&s;tre&s;s (a
widow, va&s;tly like <HI>the</HI> Eliza; if &s;he returns I am to bring them to|gether);
a &s;econd, a lively entertaining acquaintance; a third, a &s;in|cere
good-natured friend; a fourth, who would repre&s;ent with grace
and dignity at the head of my table and family; a fifth, an excel|lent
<PB N="644" REF="665">
oeconomi&s;t and hou&s;ekeeper; and a &s;ixth, a very u&s;eful nur&s;e.
Could I find all the&s;e qualities united in a &s;ingle per&s;on, I &s;hould dare
to make my addre&s;&s;es, and &s;hould de&s;erve to be refu&s;ed. You hint in
&s;ome of your letters, or rather po&s;t&s;cripts, that you con&s;ider me as
having renounced England, and having &s;ixed my&s;elf for the re&s;t of
my life in Switzerland, and that you &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of my
vague or in&s;idious &s;chemes of purcha&s;e or return. To remove, as
far as I can, your doubts and &s;u&s;picions, I will tell you, on that in|tere&s;ting
&s;ubject, fairly and &s;imply as much as I know of my own
intentions. There is little appearance that I &s;hall be &s;uddenly re|called
by the offer of a place or pen&s;ion. I have no claim to the
friend&s;hip of your young mini&s;ter, and &s;hould he propo&s;e a Com|mi&s;&s;ioner
of the Cu&s;toms, or Secretary at Paris, the &s;uppo&s;ed ob|jects
of my low ambition, Adam in Paradi&s;e would refu&s;e them with
contempt. <HI>Here</HI> therefore I &s;hall certainly live till I have fini&s;hed
the remainder of my Hi&s;tory; an arduous work, which does not
proceed &s;o fa&s;t as I expected, amid&s;t the avocations of &s;ociety, and
mi&s;cellaneous &s;tudy. As &s;oon as it is completed, mo&s;t probably in
three or <HI>four</HI> years, I &s;hall infallibly return to England, about the
month of May or June; and the nece&s;&s;ary labour of printing with
care two or three quarto volumes, will detain me till their publi|cation,
in the en&s;uing &s;pring. Lord Sheffield and your&s;elf will be
the load&s;tone that mo&s;t forcibly attracts me; and as I &s;hall be a va|gabond
on the face of the earth, I &s;hall be the better qualified to
dome&s;ticate my&s;elf with you, both in town and country. Here
then, at no very extravagant di&s;tance, we have the certainty (if we
live) of &s;pending a year together, in the peace and freedom of a
friendly intercour&s;e; and a year is no very contemptible portion of
this mortal exi&s;tence. Beyond that period all is dark, but not
gloomy. Whether, after the final completion of my Hi&s;tory, I
&s;hall return to Lau&s;anne, or &s;ettle in England, mu&s;t depend on a
thou&s;and events which lie beyond the reach of human fore&s;ight, the
<PB N="645" REF="666">
&s;tate of public and private affairs, my own health, the health and
life of Deyverdun, the various changes which may have rendered
Lau&s;anne more dear, or le&s;s agreeable, to me than at pre&s;ent. But
without lo&s;ing our&s;elves in this di&s;tant futurity, which perhaps we
may never &s;ee, and without giving any po&s;itive an&s;wer to Maria's
parting que&s;tion, whether I &s;hall be buried in England or Switzer|land,
let me &s;eriou&s;ly and earne&s;tly a&s;k you, whether you do not
mean to vi&s;it me next &s;ummer? The defeat at Coventry would, I
&s;hould think, facilitate the project; &s;ince the Baron is no longer de|tained
the whole winter from his dome&s;tic affairs, nor is there any
attendance on the Hou&s;e that keeps him till Mid&s;ummer in du&s;t and
di&s;pute. I can &s;end you a plea&s;ant route, through Normandy, Paris,
and Lyons, a vi&s;it to the Glaciers, and your return down the Rhine,
which would be commodiou&s;ly executed in three or four months, at
no very extravagant expence, and would be productive of health
and &s;pirits to you, of entertainment to you both, and of in&s;truction
to <HI>the</HI> Maria. Without the &s;malle&s;t inconvenience to my&s;elf, I am
able to lodge your&s;elves and family, by arranging you in the winter
apartment, which in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on is not of any u&s;e to us. I
think you will be &s;atisfied with your habitation, and already &s;ee you
in your dre&s;&s;ing-room; a &s;mall plea&s;ant room, with a delightful
pro&s;pect to the we&s;t and &s;outh. If poor aunt Kitty (you oblige me
beyond expre&s;&s;ion by your tender care of that excellent woman) if
&s;he were only ten years younger, I would de&s;ire you to take her
with you, but I much fear we &s;hall never meet again. You will
not complain of the brevity of this epi&s;tle; I expect, in return, a
full and fair account of your&s;elf, your thoughts and actions, &s;oul
and body, pre&s;ent and future, in the &s;afe, though unre&s;erved, con|fidence
of friend&s;hip. The Baron in two words hinted but an in|different
account of your health; you are a fine machine; but as he
was ab&s;ent in Ireland, I hope I under&s;tand the cau&s;e and the remedy.
<PB N="646" REF="667">
Next to your&s;elf, I want to hear of the two Barone&s;&s;es. You mu&s;t
give me a faithful picture (and though a mother you can give it)
of their pre&s;ent external and internal forms; for a year has now
elap&s;ed, and in <HI>their</HI> lives a year is an age. Adieu. Ever yours.</P>

<P>Another week is now elap&s;ed, and though nothing is changed in
this too faithful &s;tate of my affairs, I feel my&s;elf able to encounter
them with more &s;pirit and re&s;olution; to look on the future, rather
than the pa&s;t, on the fair, rather than on the foul &s;ide of the pro|&s;pect.
I &s;hall &s;peak in the confidence of friend&s;hip, and while you
li&s;ten to the more doleful tale of my wants and wi&s;hes, you will
<PB N="647" REF="668">
have the &s;atisfaction of hearing &s;ome circum&s;tances in my pre&s;ent
&s;ituation of a le&s;s unplea&s;ing nature. 1. In the fir&s;t place, I mo&s;t
heartily rejoice in the &s;ale, however unfavourable, of the Bucks
e&s;tate. Con&s;idering the dullne&s;s of the times, and the high intere&s;t
of money, it is not a little to obtain even a tolerable price, and I am
&s;en&s;ible how much your patience and indu&s;try have been exerci&s;ed
to extort the payment. 2. Your re&s;i&s;tance to my Swi&s;s expedition
was more friendly than wi&s;e. Had I yielded, after eighteen months
of &s;u&s;pence and anxiety, I &s;hould now, a &s;till poorer man, be driven
to embrace the &s;ame re&s;ource, which has &s;ucceeded according to, or
even beyond, my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. I do not pretend to
have di&s;covered the terre&s;trial paradi&s;e, which has not been known
in this world &s;ince the fall of Adam; but I can truly declare, (now
the charms of novelty are long &s;ince faded,) that I have found the
plan of life the be&s;t adapted to my temper and my &s;ituation. I am
now writing to you in a room as good as that in Bentinck-&s;treet,
which commands the country, the lake, and the moun|tains,
and the opening pro&s;pect of the &s;pring. The afore&s;aid
room is furni&s;hed without magnificence, but with every conve|niency
for warmth, ea&s;e, and &s;tudy, and the walls are already
covered with more than two thou&s;and volumes, the choice of a
cho&s;en library. I have health, friends, an amu&s;ing &s;ociety, and
perfect freedom. A Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Exci&s;e! the idea makes me
&s;ick. If you a&s;k me what I have &s;aved by my retreat to Lau&s;anne?
I will fairly tell you (in the two great articles of a carriage and a
hou&s;e in town, both which were indi&s;pen&s;able, and are now anni|hilated,
with the difference of clubs, public places, &s;ervants wages,
&amp;c.) about four hundred pounds, or guineas, a year; no incon&s;ider|able
&s;um, when it mu&s;t be annually found as addition to an expence
which is &s;omewhat larger than my pre&s;ent revenue. 3. <HI>What is then,
you will a&s;k, my pre&s;ent-e&s;tabli&s;hment? This</HI> is not by any means a
cheap country; and, except in the article of wine, I could give a
<PB N="648" REF="669">
dinner, or make a coat, perhaps for the &s;ame price in London as at
Lau&s;anne. My chief advantage ari&s;es from the things which I do
not want; and in &s;ome re&s;pects my &s;tyle of living is enlarged by the
increa&s;e of my relative importance, an ob&s;cure bachelor in England,
the ma&s;ter of a con&s;iderable hou&s;e at Lau&s;anne. Here I am expected
to return entertainments, to receive ladies, &amp;c. and to perform
many duties of &s;ociety, which, though agreeable enough in them|&s;elves,
contribute to inflame the hou&s;ekeeper's bills. From the di&s;|bur&s;ements
of the fir&s;t year I cannot form any ju&s;t e&s;timate; the ex|traordinary
expences of the journey, carriage of heavy goods from
England, the acqui&s;ition of many books, which it was not expe|dient
to tran&s;port, the purcha&s;e of furniture, wine, fitting up my
library, and the irregularity of a new menage, have con&s;umed a
pretty large &s;um. But in a quiet, prudent, regular cour&s;e of life, I
think I can &s;upport, my&s;elf with comfort and honour for &s;ix or &s;even
hundred pounds a year, in&s;tead of a thou&s;and or eleven hundred in
England.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e uncertainties, (uncertain at lea&s;t as to the time,) I
have a &s;ure and honourable &s;upply from my own pen. I continue
my Hi&s;tory with plea&s;ure and a&s;&s;iduity; the way is long and labo|rious,
yet I &s;ee the end, and I can almo&s;t promi&s;e to land in England
next September twelvemonth, with a manu&s;cript of the current
value of about four thou&s;and pounds, which will afford either a
&s;mall income or a large capital. 5. It is in the meanwhile that my
&s;ituation is &s;omewhat difficult. * * *
Such are the &s;ervices and revenues of the year; proceed we now, in
the &s;tyle of the budget, to the ways and means of extraordinary
&s;upplies. * * *
I will not affront your friend&s;hip,
by ob&s;erving that you will incur little or no ri&s;k on this occa&s;ion.
Read, con&s;ider, act, and write.</P>
<P><PB N="649" REF="670">
It is the privilege of friend&s;hip to make our friend a patient hearer,
and active a&s;&s;ociate in our own affairs; and I have now written five
pages on my private affairs, without &s;aying a word either of the pub|lic,
or of your&s;elf. Of the public I have little to &s;ay; I never was a
very warm patriot, and I grow every day a citizen of the world. The
&s;cramble for power or profit at We&s;tmin&s;ter or St. James's, and the
names of Pitt and Fox, become le&s;s intere&s;ting to me than tho&s;e of Cae&s;ar
and Pompey. You are not a friend of the young Mini&s;ter, but he
is a great favourite on the continent, as he appears to be &s;till; and you
mu&s;t own that the fairne&s;s of his character, his eloquence, his ap|plication
to bu&s;ine&s;s, and even his youth, mu&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;s at lea&s;t the
ignorant in his favour. Of the merit or defects of his admini&s;tra|tion
I cannot pretend to &s;peak; but I find, from the complaints of
&s;ome intere&s;ted per&s;ons, that his re&s;traints on the &s;muggling of tea
have already ruined the Ea&s;t India Companies of Antwerp and
Sweden, and that even the Dutch will &s;carcely find it worth their
while to &s;end any &s;hips to China. Your Iri&s;h friends appear to be
more quiet, at lea&s;t the volunteers and national congre&s;s &s;eem to
&s;ub&s;ide. How far that tranquillity mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed on our &s;ide,
by any pernicious &s;acrifices, you will be&s;t decide; and from &s;ome
hint in your la&s;t letters, I am inclined to think that you are le&s;s af|fected
than might be &s;uppo&s;ed with national or local prejudice.
Your introduction I have attentively read; the matter, though mo&s;t
important in it&s;elf, is out of the line of my &s;tudies and habits, and
the &s;ubordinate beauties of &s;tyle you di&s;claim. Yet I can &s;ay with
truth, that I never met with more curious and diligent inve&s;tigation,
more &s;trong &s;en&s;e, more liberal &s;pirit, and more cool and impartial
temper in the &s;ame number of pages. By this time you have pro|bably
read Necker's book on the finances. Perhaps for you there is
too much French enthu&s;ia&s;m and paint; but in many re&s;pects you
mu&s;t have gained a knowledge of his country; and on the whole,
you mu&s;t have been plea&s;ed with the picture of a great and bene|volent
<PB N="650" REF="671">
mind. In your attack on Deyverdun for my picture I cannot
promi&s;e you much &s;ucce&s;s; he &s;eems re&s;olved to maintain his right
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and your only chance would be a per&s;onal a&s;&s;ault. The
next &s;ummer (how time &s;lips away!) was fixed for your vi&s;it to
Lau&s;anne. We are prepared at all points to receive <HI>you,</HI> my Lady,
and a prince&s;s or two, with their train; and if you have a proper
contempt for St. Stephen's chapel, you are perfectly free, and at
lei&s;ure (can you ever be at lei&s;ure?) for the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. As
you are now in a great mea&s;ure di&s;engaged from any affairs, you
may find time to inform me of your proceedings and your projects.
At pre&s;ent I do not even know whether you pa&s;s the winter at Shef|field-Place
or in Downing-&s;treet. My Lady revenges her&s;elf of my
long &s;ilence; yet I embrace her and the infants. Adieu. You
have deranged the Decline and Fall this morning. I have fini&s;hed
my epi&s;tle &s;ince dinner, and am now going to a plea&s;ant party and
good &s;upper.</P>

<HEAD>N^o CLXXXII. EDWARD GIBBON E&s;quire to the Right Honourable Lord SHEFFIELD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>September 5th, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EXTRACT from a weekly Engli&s;h Paper, September 5th, 1785.
<Q>It is reported, but we hope without foundation, that the ce|lebrated
Mr. Gibbon, who had retired to Lau&s;anne in Switzer|land
to fini&s;h his valuable Hi&s;tory, lately died in that city.</Q></P>
<P>The hope of the New&s;paper-writer is very hand&s;ome and obliging
to the Hi&s;torian; yet there are &s;everal weighty rea&s;ons which would
incline me to believe that the intelligence may be true. <HI>Primo,</HI> It
mu&s;t one day be true; and therefore may very probably be &s;o at
pre&s;ent. <HI>Secundo,</HI> We may always depend on the impartiality, ac|curacy,
and veracity of an Engli&s;h New&s;paper. <HI>Tertio,</HI> which is
<PB N="651" REF="672">
indeed the &s;tronge&s;t argument, We are credibly informed that for a
long time pa&s;t the &s;aid celebrated Hi&s;torian has not written to any
of his friends in England; and as that re&s;pectable per&s;onage had
always the reputation of a mo&s;t exact and regular corre&s;pondent, it
may be fairly concluded from his &s;ilence, that he either is, or ought
to be dead. The only objection that I can fore&s;ee, is the a&s;&s;urance
that Mr. G&mdash;him&s;elf read the article as he was eating his break|fa&s;t,
and laughed very heartily at the mi&s;take of his brother Hi&s;to|rian;
but as he might be de&s;irous of concealing that unplea&s;ant
event, we &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on his apparent health and &s;pirits, which
might be affected by that &s;ubtle politician. He affirms, however,
not only that he is alive, and was &s;o on the fifth of September, but
that his head, his heart, his &s;tomach, are in the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate,
and that the climate of Lau&s;anne has been congenial both to his mind
and body. He confe&s;&s;es indeed, that after the la&s;t &s;evere winter, the
gout, his old enemy, from whom he hoped to have e&s;caped, pur|&s;ued
him to his retreat among the mountains of Helvetia, and that
the &s;iege was long, though more languid than in his precedent at|tacks;
after &s;ome exerci&s;e of patience he began to creep, and gra|dually
to walk; and though he can neither run, nor fly, nor dance,
he &s;upports him&s;elf with firmne&s;s on his two legs, and would will|ingly
kick the impertinent Gazetteer; impertinent enough, though
more ea&s;ily to be forgiven than the in&s;olent <HI>Courier du Bas Rhin,</HI>
who about three years ago amu&s;ed him&s;elf and his readers with a
fictitious epi&s;tle from Mr. Gibbon to Dr. Robert&s;on.</P>
<P>Perhaps now you think, Baron, that I &s;hall apologize in humble
&s;tyle for my &s;ilence and neglect. But, on the contrary, I do
a&s;&s;ure you that I am truly provoked at your Lord&s;hip's not conde|&s;cending
to be in a pa&s;&s;ion. I might really have been dead, I might
have been &s;ick; if I were neither dead nor &s;ick, I de&s;erved a volley of
cur&s;es and reproaches for my infernal lazine&s;s, and you have de&s;rauded
me of my ju&s;t dues. Had I been &s;ilent till Chri&s;tmas, till doom&s;|day,
<PB N="652" REF="673">
you would never have thought it worth your while to abu&s;e
me. Why then (let me a&s;k in your name) did you not write be|fore?
That is indeed a very curious que&s;tion of natural and moral
philo&s;ophy. Certainly I am not lazy; elaborate quartos have proved,
and will abundantly prove my diligence. I <HI>can</HI> write; &s;pare my
mode&s;ty on that &s;ubject. I like to conver&s;e with my friends by pen
or tongue, and as &s;oon as I can &s;et my&s;elf a going, I know no mo|ments
that run off more plea&s;antly. I am &s;o well convinced of that
truth, &s;o much a&s;hamed of forcing people that I love to forget
me, that I have now re&s;olved to &s;et apart the fir&s;t hour of each
day for the di&s;charge of my obligations; beginning, <HI>comme de rai&s;on,</HI>
with your&s;elf, and regularly proceeding to Lord Loughborough and
the re&s;t. May Heaven give me &s;trength and grace to accompli&s;h
this laudable intention! Amen. Certainly (yet I do not know
whether it be &s;o certain) I &s;hould write much oftener to you if we
were not linked in bu&s;ine&s;s, and if my bu&s;ine&s;s had not always been
of the unplea&s;ant and mortifying kind. Even now I &s;hove the ugly
mon&s;ter to the end of this epi&s;tle, and will confine him to a page by
him&s;elf, that he may not infect the purer air of our corre&s;pondence.
Of my &s;ituation here I have little new to &s;ay, except a very comfort|able
and &s;ingular truth, that my pa&s;&s;ion for my wife or mi&s;tre&s;s (Fanny
Lau&s;anne) is not palled by &s;atiety and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two years. I
have &s;een her in all &s;ea&s;ons, and in all humours, and though &s;he is
not without faults, they are infinitely overbalanced by her good
qualities. Her face is not hand&s;ome, but her per&s;on, and every
thing about her, has admirable grace and beauty: &s;he is of a very
cheerful &s;ociable temper; without much learning, &s;he is endowed
with ta&s;te and good &s;en&s;e; and though not rich, the &s;implicity of
her education makes her a very good oeconomi&s;t; &s;he is forbid by
her parents to wear any expen&s;ive finery; and though her limbs are
not much calculated for walking, &s;he has not yet a&s;ked me to keep
her a coach. La&s;t &s;pring (not to wear the metaphor to rags) I &s;aw
<PB N="653" REF="674">
Lau&s;anne in a new light, during my long fit of the gout, and mu&s;t
boldly declare, that either in health or &s;ickne&s;s I find it far more
comfortable than your huge metropolis. In London my confine|ment
was &s;ad and &s;olitary; the many forgot my exi&s;tence when they
&s;aw me no longer at Brookes's; and the few, who &s;ometimes ca&s;t a
thought or an eye on their friend, were detained by bu&s;ine&s;s or
plea&s;ure, the di&s;tance of the way, or the hours of the Hou&s;e of
Commons, and I was proud and happy if I could prevail on Elm&s;ly
to enliven the dulne&s;s of the evening. Here the objects are nearer,
and much more di&s;tinct, and I my&s;elf am an object of much larger
magnitude. People are not kinder, but they are more idle, and it
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that, of all nations on the globe, the Engli&s;h are
the lea&s;t attentive to the old and infirm; I do not mean in acts of
charity, but in the offices of civil life. During three months I have
had round my chair a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of agreeable men and women, who
came with a &s;mile, and vani&s;hed at a nod; and as &s;oon as it was agree|able
I had a con&s;tant party at cards, which was &s;ometimes di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
to their re&s;pective homes, and &s;ometimes detained by Dyverdun to
&s;upper, without the lea&s;t trouble or inconvenience to my&s;elf. In a
word, my plan has mo&s;t completely an&s;wered; and I &s;olemnly pro|te&s;t,
after two years trial, that I have never in a &s;ingle moment re|pented
of my tran&s;migration. The only di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance
is the increa&s;e of a race of animals with which this country has been
long infe&s;ted, and who are &s;aid to come from an i&s;land in the
Northern Ocean. I am told, but it &s;eems incredible, that upwards
of forty thou&s;and Engli&s;h, ma&s;ters and &s;ervants, are now ab&s;ent on
the continent; and I am &s;ure we have our full proportion, both in
town and country, from the month of June to that of October.
The occupations of the clo&s;et, indifferent health, want of hor&s;es,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure plead my excu&s;e; yet I do too much to plea&s;e my|&s;elf,
and probably too little to &s;atisfy my countrymen. What is &s;till
more unlucky is, that a part of the colony of this pre&s;ent year are
<PB N="654" REF="675">
really good company, people one knows, &amp;c.; the A&s;tons, Hales,
Hampdens, Trevors, Lady Clarges and Mi&s;s Carter, Lord North|ington,
&amp;c. I have &s;een Trevor &s;everal times, who talks of you, and
&s;eems to be a more exact corre&s;pondent than my&s;elf. <HI>His wife</HI> is
much improved by her diplomatic life, and &s;hines in every company,
as a woman of fa&s;hion and elegance. But tho&s;e who have repaid
me for the re&s;t, were Lord and Lady Spencer. I &s;aw them almo&s;t
every day, at my hou&s;e or their own, during their &s;tay of a month;
for they were ha&s;tening to Italy, that they might return to Lon|don
next February. He is a valuable man, and where he is fami|liar,
a plea&s;ant companion; &s;he a charming woman, who, with
&s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, has the &s;implicity and playfulne&s;s of a child. You
are not ignorant of her talents, of which &s;he has left me an
agreeable &s;pecimen, a drawing of the Hi&s;toric Mu&s;e, &s;itting in a
thoughtful po&s;ture to compo&s;e. So much of &s;elf and Co. let us
now talk a little of your hou&s;e and your two countries. Does my
Lady ever join in the abu&s;e which I have merited from you? Is &s;he
&s;atisfied with her own behaviour, her unpardonable &s;ilence, to one of
the prettie&s;t, mo&s;t obliging, mo&s;t entertaining, mo&s;t, &amp;c. epi&s;tles
that ever was penned &s;ince the epi&s;tles of * * *?
Will &s;he not <HI>mew</HI> one word of reply? I want &s;ome account of her
&s;pirits, health, amu&s;ements, of the elegant accompli&s;hments of Maria,
and the opening graces of Loui&s;a: of your&s;elf I wi&s;h to have &s;ome
of tho&s;e details which &s;he is mo&s;t likely to tran&s;mit. Are you patient
in your exclu&s;ion from the Hou&s;e? Are you &s;atisfied with legi&s;|lating
with your pen? Do you pa&s;s the whole winter in town?
Have you re&s;umed the pur&s;uits of farming, &amp;c.? What new con|nections,
public or private, have you formed? A tour to the conti|nent
would be the be&s;t medicine for the &s;hattered nerves of a &s;oldier
and politician. By this expre&s;&s;ion you will perceive that your letter
to Deyverdun is received; it landed la&s;t po&s;t, after I had already
written the two fir&s;t pages of this compo&s;ition. On the whole my
<PB N="655" REF="676">
friend was plea&s;ed and flattered; but in&s;tead of &s;urrendering, or ca|pitulating,
he &s;eems to be making preparations for an ob&s;tinate de|fence.
He already talks of the right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His portrait, painted by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds.</NOTE>, of the duties
of a good citizen, of a <HI>writ ue exeat regnum,</HI> and of a vote of the
two hundred, that whom&s;oever &s;hall, directly or indirectly, &amp;c. is
an enemy to his country. Between you be the &s;trife, while I &s;it
with my &s;cales in my hand, like Jupiter on Mount Ida. I begin to
view with the &s;ame indifference the combat of Achilles Pitt, and Hector
Fox; for &s;uch, as it &s;hould now &s;eem, mu&s;t be the compari&s;on of
the two warriors. * * *
At this di&s;tance I am much le&s;s angry with bills, taxes, and propo|&s;itions,
than I am plea&s;ed with Pitt for making a friend and a de&s;erv|ing
man happy, for relea&s;ing Batt from the &s;hackles of the law, and
for enhancing the gift of a &s;ecure and honourable competency, by
the hand&s;ome manner in which it was conferred. This I under|&s;tand
to be the ca&s;e, from the un&s;u&s;picious evidence of Lord North|ington
and Chief Baron Skinner; and if I can find time, (<HI>re&s;olution,</HI>)
I will &s;end him a hearty congratulation; if I fail, you may at lea&s;t
communicate my intentions. Of Ireland I know nothing, and while
I am writing the Decline of a great Empire, I have not lei&s;ure to
attend to the affairs of a remote and petty province. I &s;ee that your
friend Fo&s;ter has been hooted by the mob, and unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en
Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons. How could Pitt expo&s;e him|&s;elf
to the di&s;grace of withdrawing his propo&s;itions after a public
attempt? Have Mini&s;ters no way of computing beforehand the
&s;en&s;e or non&s;en&s;e of an Iri&s;h Parliament? I am quite in the dark;
your pamphlet, or book, would probably have opened my eyes; but,
whatever may have been the rea&s;on, I give you <HI>my word of honour,</HI>
that I have never &s;een nor heard of it. Here we are much more
engaged with continental politics. In general we hate the Emperor,
<PB N="656" REF="677">
as the enemy of peace, without daring to make war. The old lion
of Pru&s;&s;ia acts a much more glorious part, as the champion of public
tranquillity, and the independence of the German &s;tates.</P>
<P>And now for the bitter and nau&s;eous pill of pecuniary bu&s;ine&s;s,
upon which I &s;hall be as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible in the two articles of my
di&s;cour&s;e, land and money. * * *
It is impo&s;&s;ible to hate more than I do this odious nece&s;&s;ity of
owing, borrowing, anticipating, and I look forwards with impatience
to the happy period when the &s;upplies will always be rai&s;ed within
the year, with a decent and u&s;eful &s;urplus in the trea&s;ury. I now
tru&s;t to the conclu&s;ion of my Hi&s;tory, and it will ha&s;ten and &s;ecure
the principal comforts of my life. You will believe I am not lazy;
yet I fear the term is &s;omewhat more di&s;tant than I thought. My
long gout lo&s;t me three months in the &s;pring; in every great work
unfore&s;een dangers, and difficulties, and delays will ari&s;e; and I
&s;hould be rather &s;orry than &s;urpri&s;ed if next autumn was po&s;tponed
to the en&s;uing &s;pring. If my Lady (a good creature) &s;hould write
to Mrs. Porten, &s;he may convey news of my life and health, without
&s;aying any thing of this <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> delay. Adieu. I embrace, &amp;c.

<P>HEAR, all ye nations! An epi&s;tle from Sheffield-Place, received the
&s;eventeenth of January, is an&s;wered the &s;ame day; and to &s;ay
the truth, this method, which is the be&s;t, is at the &s;ame time the

&s;ilence and delay you have any more rea&s;on to &s;wear than my&s;elf.
Our letters cro&s;&s;ed each other, our claims were equal, and if both
<PB N="657" REF="678">
had been &s;tiffly maintained, our mutual &s;ilence mu&s;t have continued
till the day of judgment. The balance was doubtle&s;s in my favour,

matter of my la&s;t di&s;patch. Even at pre&s;ent, of my&s;elf, my

only &s;peak dryly and briefly to very dry and di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s.
* * * But we &s;hall both agree,
that the true criminal is my Lady; and though I do &s;uppo&s;e that a
letter is on the road, which will make &s;ome amends, her ob&s;tinate,
contumacious, dilatory &s;ilence, &s;o many months or years &s;ince my
valuable letter, is worthy a royal tigre&s;s. * * *
Notwith&s;tanding your gloomy politicians, I do love the funds; and
were the next war to reduce them to half, the remainder would be
a better and plea&s;anter property, than a &s;imilar value in your dirty
acres. We are now in the height of our winter amu&s;ements; balls,
great &s;uppers, comedies, &amp;c. and, except St. Stephen's, I certainly
lead a more gay and di&s;&s;ipated life here, among the Alps, (by the
bye, a mo&s;t extraordinary mild winter,) than in the mid&s;t of Lon|don.
Yet my mornings, and &s;ometimes an afternoon, are diligently
employed. My work advances, but much remains, indeed much
more than I imagined; but a great book, like a great hou&s;e, was
never yet fini&s;hed at the given time. When I talk of the &s;pring of
eighty-&s;even, I &s;uppo&s;e all my time well be&s;towed; and what do you
think of a fit of the gout, that may di&s;qualify me for two or three
months? You may growl, but if you calmly reflect on my pecu|niary
and &s;entimental &s;tate, you will believe that I mo&s;t earne&s;tly
de&s;ire to complete my labour, and <HI>vi&s;it</HI> England. Adieu.</P>

<P>BY the difference, I &s;uppo&s;e, of the po&s;ts of France and Germany,
Sir Stanier's letter, though fir&s;t written, is &s;till on the road,
and your's, which I received ye&s;terday morning, brought me the
fir&s;t account of poor Mrs. Porten's departure. There are few events
that could afflict me more deeply, and I have been ever &s;ince in a
&s;tate of mind more de&s;erving of your pity than of your reproaches. I
certainly am not ignorant that we have nothing better to wi&s;h for our|&s;elves
than the fate of that be&s;t-humoured woman, as you very ju&s;tly
&s;tyle her; a good under&s;tanding and an excellent heart, with health,
&s;pirits, and a competency, to live in the mid&s;t of her friends till the
age of four&s;core, and then to &s;hut her eyes without pain or remor&s;e.
Death can have deprived her only of &s;ome years of weakne&s;s, per|haps
of mi&s;ery; and for my&s;elf, it is &s;urely le&s;s painful to lo&s;e her
at pre&s;ent, than to find her in my vi&s;it to England next year &s;inking
under the weight of age and infirmities, and perhaps forgetful of
her&s;elf and of the per&s;ons once the deare&s;t to her. All this is per|fectly
true: but all the&s;e reflections will not di&s;pel a thou&s;and &s;ad
and tender remembrances that ru&s;h upon my mind. To her care I
am indebted in earlie&s;t infancy for the pre&s;ervation of my life and
health. I was a puny child, neglected by my mother, &s;tarved by
my nur&s;e, and of who&s;e being very little care or expectation was
entertained; without her maternal vigilance I &s;hould either have
been in my grave, or imperfectly lived a crooked ricketty mon&s;ter,
a burden to my&s;elf and others. To her in&s;tructions I owe the fir&s;t
rudiments of knowledge, the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, and a ta&s;te for
books, which is &s;till the plea&s;ure and glory of my life; and though
&s;he taught me neither language nor &s;cience, &s;he was certainly the
<PB N="659" REF="680">
mo&s;t u&s;eful preceptor I ever had. As I grew up, an intercour&s;e of
thirty years endeared her to me, as the faithful friend and the agree|able
companion. You have &s;een with what freedom and confidence
we lived together, and have often admired her character and conver|&s;ation,
which could alike plea&s;e the young and the old. All this is
now lo&s;t, finally, irrecoverably lo&s;t! I will agree with my Lady,
that the immortality of the &s;oul is at &s;ome times a very comfortable
doctrine. A thou&s;and thanks to her for her con&s;tant kind attention
to that poor woman who is no more. I wi&s;h I had as much to ap|plaud,
and as little to reproach, in my own behaviour towards Mrs.
Porten &s;ince I left England; and when I reflect that my letters would
have &s;oothed and comforted her decline, I feel more deeply than I
can expre&s;s, the real neglect, and &s;eeming indifference, of my &s;ilence.
To delay a letter from the Wedne&s;day to the Saturday, and then
from the Saturday to the Wedne&s;day, appears a very &s;light offence;
yet in the repetition of &s;uch delay, weeks, months, and years will
clap&s;e, till the omi&s;&s;ion may become irretrievable, and the con&s;e|quence
mi&s;chievous or fatal. After a long lethargy, I had rouzed
my&s;elf la&s;t week, and wrote to the three old Ladies; my letter for
Mrs. Porten went away la&s;t po&s;t, Saturday night, and yours did not
arrive till Monday morning. Sir Stanier will probably open it, and
read the true picture of my &s;entiments for a friend who, when I
wrote, was already extinct. There is &s;omething &s;ad and awful in
the thought, yet, on the whole, I am not &s;orry that even this tardy
epi&s;tle preceded my knowledge of her death: but it did not precede
(you will ob&s;erve) the information of her dangerous and declining
&s;tate, which I conveyed in my la&s;t letter, and her anxious concern
that &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee or <HI>hear</HI> from me again. This idea, and
the hard thoughts which you mu&s;t entertain of me, pre&s;s &s;o much
on my mind, that I mu&s;t frankly acknowledge a &s;trange inexcu&s;able
&s;upinene&s;s, on which I de&s;ire you would make no comment, and
<PB N="660" REF="681">
which in &s;ome mea&s;ure may account for my delays in corre&s;ponding
with you. The unplea&s;ant nature of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the apprehen&s;ion
of finding &s;omething di&s;agreeable, tempted me to po&s;tpone from day
to day, not only the an&s;wering, but even the opening, your penulti|mate
epi&s;tle; and when I received your la&s;t, ye&s;terday morning, the
&s;eal of the former was &s;till unbroken. Oblige me &s;o far as to make
no reflections; my own may be of &s;ervice to me hereafter. Thus
far (except the la&s;t &s;entence) I have run on with a &s;ort of melan|choly
plea&s;ure, and find my heart much relieved by unfolding it to
a friend. And the &s;ubject &s;o &s;trongly holds me, &s;o much di&s;qualifies
me for other di&s;cour&s;e, either &s;erious or plea&s;ant, that here I would
willingly &s;top, and re&s;erve all mi&s;cellaneous matter for a &s;econd vo|lunteer
epi&s;tle. But we both know how frail are promi&s;es, how
dangerous are delays, and there are &s;ome pecuniary objects on which
I think it nece&s;&s;ary to give you an immediate, though now tardy,
explanation.</P>
<P>I do not return you any formal thanks for * * *
I have really a hundred things to &s;ay of my&s;elf, of you and Co. of
your works, of mine, of my books in Downing-&s;treet, of Lau&s;anne,
of politics, &amp;c. &amp;c. After this, &s;ome epi&s;tolary debts mu&s;t and
SHALL be paid; and to proceed with order, I have fixed this day
fortnight (May twenty-fifth) for the date and di&s;patch of your &s;e|cond
epi&s;tle. Give me credit once more. Pray does my Lady

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>May 12th, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE melancholy event which you have communicated, in your
la&s;t obliging letter of the twenty-fourth of April, might indeed
be too naturally feared and expected. If we con&s;ult our rea&s;on, we
can wi&s;h nothing better for our&s;elves than the lot of that dear and
valuable friend whom we have now lo&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His aunt, Mrs. Catherine Porten.</NOTE>. A warm heart, a &s;trong
and clear under&s;tanding, a mo&s;t invaluable happine&s;s of temper,
which &s;hewed her the agreeable or comfortable &s;ide of every object,
and every &s;ituation; an ea&s;y competency, the reward of her own
attention; private friend&s;hip, general e&s;teem, a mature age, and a
placid decline. But the&s;e rational motives of con&s;olation are in&s;uf|ficient
to check a thou&s;and &s;oft and &s;ad remembrances that ru&s;h into
my mind; the intimacy of a whole life; of mine, at lea&s;t, from the
earlie&s;t dawn of my infancy; the maternal and a&s;&s;iduous care of my
health, and afterwards of my mind; the freedom and frequency of
our conver&s;ations; the regret which I felt in our la&s;t &s;eparation, and
the hope, however faint and precarious, of &s;eeing her again. Time
alone can reconcile us to this irreparable lo&s;s, and to his healing
power I mu&s;t recommend your grief, as well as my own. I &s;in|cerely
applaud her very proper and natural di&s;po&s;al of her effects,
and am proud of the pre-eminence which &s;he has allowed me in a
li&s;t of dear and worthy relations.</P>
<P>I am too full of a &s;ingle idea to expatiate, as I &s;hould otherwi&s;e
do, on indifferent matters; yet not totally indifferent to my friends,
&s;ince they relate to my pre&s;ent &s;ituation. My health is in general
<PB N="662" REF="683">
perfectly good, and the only drawbacks &s;ome occa&s;ional vi&s;its of the
gout, which abate, however, in &s;trength, and are grown, I think
le&s;s frequent and la&s;ting. The life which I lead is temperate and
tranquil, and the di&s;temper it&s;elf is not common in the purity and
dryne&s;s of the climate. After a long trial, I can now approve my
own choice of retiring to Switzerland. My delightful habitation, at
once in town and country; my library, and the &s;ociety of agreeable
men and women, compo&s;e a very eligible plan of life, which is
&s;haded with very few, and very &s;light exceptions. I pro&s;ecute with
ea&s;e, and regular diligence, the conclu&s;ion of my Hi&s;tory; and, as
far as I can judge, I may hope to deliver it to the pre&s;s in the cour&s;e
of next year. That important bu&s;ine&s;s will recal me to England,
and detain me there &s;ome months; and I &s;hall rejoice in the oppor|tunity
of revi&s;iting my country and my friends; among them tho&s;e
of Ken&s;ington-Palace hold a high and di&s;tingui&s;hed place.</P>
<P>I truly &s;ympathize, my dear Sir, in your paternal feelings, in the
health and progre&s;s of your very promi&s;ing children. May that,
and every other ble&s;&s;ing, attend both your&s;elf and Lady Porten.
My friend M. Deyverdun de&s;ires to a&s;&s;ure you of his re&s;pect and
good wi&s;hes. I am, dear Sir, mo&s;t affectionately yours.</P>

<P>* * *
Since I have another page, and &s;ome lei&s;ure moments,
we may as well employ it in friendly conver&s;e; the more &s;o, as the
great letter to which I alluded is wonderfully precarious and uncer|tain:
the more &s;o likewi&s;e, as our corre&s;pondence for &s;ome time pa&s;t
has been of an abrupt and di&s;agreeable ca&s;t. Let us fir&s;t talk of Shef|field's
<PB N="663" REF="684">
works: they are of two &s;orts: <HI>Primo,</HI> Two nymphs, whom I
much de&s;ire to &s;ee; the &s;prightly Maria and the gentle Loui&s;a. I
perfectly repre&s;ent them both in the eye of fancy; each of them
accompli&s;hed according to her age and character, yet totally different
in their external and internal forms. <HI>Secundo,</HI> Three pamphlets;
pamphlets! I cry you mercy; three weighty treati&s;es, almo&s;t as
u&s;eful as an inquiry into the &s;tate of the primitive church. And
here let me ju&s;tify, if I have not before, my &s;ilence on a &s;ubject
which we authors do not ea&s;ily forgive. The fir&s;t, who&s;e fir&s;t edi|tions
had &s;een the light before I left England, followed me here in
a more complete condition; and that Treati&s;e on the American Trade
has been read, judged, approved, and reported. The &s;econd, on
Ireland, I have &s;een by accident the copy you &s;ent to Mr. Trevor, who
pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t &s;ummer (eighty-five) here. The third, and in my pre|&s;ent
&s;ituation the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, on the French Commerce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A mi&s;take&mdash;Lord Sheffield did not PUBLISH any tract on French Commerce.</NOTE>, I
have not yet &s;een by any means what&s;oever, and you who know
what orders you have given to Elm&s;ly or others, will be&s;t di&s;cern on
whom &s;hould be laid the fault and the blame. By the bye, Mrs.
Trevor is now here, without her hu&s;band, and I am ju&s;t going to
&s;ee her, about a mile out of town: &s;he is judged elegant and ami|able.
But to return to your books, all that I have &s;een mu&s;t do you
honour, and might do the public &s;ervice; you are above the trifling
decorations of &s;tyle; but your &s;en&s;e is &s;trong, your views im|partial,
and your indu&s;try laudable. I find that your American
Tract is ju&s;t tran&s;lated into German. Do you &s;till corre&s;pond with
* * *? If he could e&s;tabli&s;h a beneficial intercour&s;e between
the two fir&s;t nations in the world, I would excu&s;e him &s;ome little
political tergiver&s;ation. At &s;ome di&s;tance of time and place, tho&s;e
dome&s;tic &s;quabbles lo&s;s much of their importance; and though I
&s;hould not forgive him any breach of private friend&s;hip or confi|dence,
<PB N="664" REF="685">
I cannot much blame him if he cho&s;e rather to &s;erve his fa|mily
and his country, than to per&s;evere in a hopele&s;s and, as I &s;u&s;|pect,
an unpopular oppo&s;ition. You have never told me clearly
and correctly how you &s;upport your inactive retreat from the Hou&s;e
of Commons; whether you have re&s;umed your long forgotten ta&s;te
for rural and dome&s;tic plea&s;ures, and whether you have never ca&s;t a
look towards Coventry, or &s;ome other borough equally pure and
re&s;pectable. In the &s;hort &s;pace that is left I will only repeat more
di&s;tinctly, that in the pre&s;ent contemplation of my work, June or
July of next year is the earlie&s;t term at which I can hope to &s;ee Eng|land;
and if I have a fit of the gout? I have indeed been free from
the mon&s;ter this la&s;t twelvemonth; but he is mo&s;t arbitrary and ca|pricious.
Of my own &s;ituation let me &s;ay with truth that it is tran|quil,
ea&s;y, and well adapted to my character. All enthu&s;ia&s;m is
now at an end; I &s;ee things in their true light, and I applaud the
judgment and choice of my retirement. I am well, happy, and
diligent; but your kind hint of the London hou&s;e is perfectly &s;uper|fluous;
as in&s;tead of the <HI>&s;pring,</HI> we mu&s;t already read the <HI>&s;ummer</HI> of
next year. Do not be childi&s;h or pa&s;&s;ionate; tru&s;t me, I wi&s;h to
appear in England; but it mu&s;t be with my book in my hand; and
a book takes more time in making than a pudding. Adieu. Will
my Lady never write?</P>
<P>You &s;ee why I have left a blank in the fir&s;t page; and when I
begun I had no de&s;ign of going beyond it; and now, unle&s;s I have
&s;ome extraordinary fit of diligence and zeal, &s;hall probably wait till
the return of your epi&s;tle. A word before we part, about the lea&s;t
unplea&s;ant of my bu&s;ine&s;s; my library in Downing-&s;treet. Excu&s;e
the accidental derangement; I &s;hall &s;end for no more books, and
only beg you to give them &s;helter in your uninhabited parlour till
my arrival. Two or three mornings will &s;uffice for per&s;onal review,
and the &s;ub&s;equent &s;teps of &s;ale or travel will mo&s;t properly be exe|cuted

<P>I RECEIVED your letter this morning (the 16th in&s;tant), and an|&s;wer
it the &s;ame day. I am a &s;ad corre&s;pondent, but it has been
my con&s;tant endeavour that my negligence &s;hould never affect the
intere&s;t or happine&s;s of my friends.</P>
<P>The report you &s;o kindly mention is &s;omewhat incorrect. I
never could fix a particular day for dining with Lord Sheffield, nor
&s;hould I think of performing the journey in the winter month of
February. The la&s;t autumn was the term which I had fixed in my
hopes, and long &s;ince in my letters to him. It has been changed
to next &s;pring, and by the &s;pring I mu&s;t now under&s;tand the
middle of the &s;ummer, which I can at pre&s;ent a&s;certain with &s;ome
confidence, from a nearer pro&s;pect of the end of my work, which I
&s;hall bring over for the pre&s;s. It will con&s;i&s;t of three more quarto
volumes, &s;omewhat thinner, perhaps, than their predece&s;&s;ors; but as
that difference cannot be enough to affect the price, it will be &s;o
much &s;aved on the author's pains, and the printer's expences. I am
happy to under&s;tand the public entertain the &s;ame opinion of the
pa&s;t, and the &s;ame impatience for the remainder; and, unle&s;s I am
&s;trangely deceived, their expectation will not be di&s;appointed. The
three la&s;t volumes are laboured at lea&s;t with equal diligence; they
contain a longer period of time, and a far greater variety of events;
and the whole will compri&s;e a general &s;eries of hi&s;tory, from the
reign of Trajan and the Antonines, to the taking of Con&s;tantinople
by Mahomet the Second; with a review of Mahomet and his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors,
the Cru&s;ades and the Turks, as far as in their utmo&s;t latitude
they are connected with the fate of the Ea&s;tern or We&s;tern Empire.
With regard to our pecuniary arrangements, I per&s;uade my&s;elf that
<PB N="666" REF="687">
we &s;hall have no more difficulties now than heretofore; that you
will cheerfully a&s;&s;ign the &s;ame value to the three younger as to the
three elder brothers; and that &s;o important a tran&s;action will have
been concluded in the fir&s;t in&s;tance by three minutes of conver&s;a|tion,
and in the &s;econd by three lines of a letter; a memorable ex|ample
in the annals of authors and book&s;ellers. If you agree with
me on this &s;ubject, you may provide paper, &amp;c. as &s;oon as you
plea&s;e in the &s;pring, in the full confidence of &s;eeing me with my
book in the &s;ummer; and I &s;hould not be &s;orry to learn what time
(in u&s;ing the utmo&s;t expedition) would be &s;ufficient for printing,
and how late you would con&s;ent to publi&s;h in the en&s;uing &s;pring.
At this moment, when I am &s;training every nerve to conclude my
living labours, I am ill-di&s;po&s;ed to lo&s;e any time in the dull dead
work of correcting a new edition. When I am in England, quiet
in the country, there would be room and lei&s;ure for a complete re|vi&s;ion;
and I &s;hould have no objection to place at the end of the
&s;ixth volume a &s;tring of amendments and improvements, which
hereafter might be in&s;erted in their proper places. We &s;hall like|wi&s;e
have occa&s;ion for a good and general index to the whole.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely condole with you in your various lo&s;&s;es: Ro&s;e and
Strahan were indeed valuable men. For my&s;elf, you will rejoice to
hear that I am &s;atisfied with my Swi&s;s retirement; and that, except
&s;ome mild and tran&s;ient fits of the gout, I enjoy as much health and
happine&s;s as is compatible with the lot of man. I expect with much
impatience Dr. Robert&s;on's improved edition. There are three or
four books which I &s;hould like to have without delay: that work,
Pennant's Arctic Zoology, White's Sermons (the Arabic profe&s;&s;or),
the Annual Regi&s;ters &s;ince the year 1782. With Elm&s;ley's a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
(he is a &s;ad dog, but I will write to him &s;oon) could you not
inclo&s;e them in a &s;mall box, with any other recent publications of
merit, and di&s;patch them in&s;tantly by &s;ome more co&s;tly and expedi|tious

<P>AFTER &s;ome &s;allies of wrath, you &s;eem at length to have &s;ub&s;ided
in &s;ullen &s;ilence, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s not totally without rea&s;on.
Yet if your mind be &s;till open to truth, you will confe&s;s that I am
not &s;o black as I appear. 1. Your Lord&s;hip has &s;hewn much le&s;s
activity and eloquence than formerly, and your la&s;t letter was an
an&s;wer to mine, which I had expected &s;ome time with impatience.
Bad examples are dangerous to young people. 2. Formerly I have
neglected an&s;wering your epi&s;tles on e&s;&s;ential, though unplea&s;ant,
bu&s;ine&s;s; and the <HI>res-publica</HI> or <HI>privata</HI> may have &s;uffered by
my neglect. Suppo&s;ing therefore we had no tran&s;actions, why
&s;hould I write &s;o often? To exchange &s;entimental compliments, or
to relate the various and important tran&s;actions of the republic of
Lau&s;anne. As long as I do not inform you of my death, you have
good grounds to believe me alive and well. You have a general,
and will &s;oon have a more particular idea of my &s;y&s;tem and arrange|ment
here. One day glides away after another in tranquil uni|formity.
Every object mu&s;t have &s;ides and moments le&s;s luminous
than others; but, upon the whole, the life and the place which I have
cho&s;en are mo&s;t happily adapted to my character and circum&s;tances;
and I can now repeat, at the end of three years, what I &s;oon and
&s;incerely affirmed, that never, in a &s;ingle in&s;tant, have I repented of
my &s;cheme of retirement to Lau&s;anne; a retirement which was
judged by my be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t friend a project little &s;hort of in&s;anity.
The place, the people, the climate, have an&s;wered or exceeded my
warme&s;t expectations. And though I truly rejoice in my approach|ing
vi&s;it to England, Mr. Pitt, were he your friend and mine, would
not find it an ea&s;y ta&s;k to prevent my return. 3. And now let me add
<PB N="668" REF="689">
a third rea&s;on, which often diverted me from writing; namely, my
impatience to &s;ee you this next &s;ummer. I am building a great
book, which, be&s;ides the three &s;tories already expo&s;ed to the public
eye, will have three &s;tories more before we reach the roof and
battlements. You too have built or altered a great Gothic ca&s;tle
with baronial battlements. Did you fini&s;h it within the time you
intended? As that time drew near, did you not find a thou&s;and
namele&s;s and unexpected works that mu&s;t be performed; each of
them calling for a portion of time and labour? and had you not de|&s;pi&s;ed,
nobly de&s;pi&s;ed, the minute diligence of fini&s;hing, fitting up,
and furni&s;hing the apartments, you would have di&s;covered a new
train of indi&s;pen&s;able bu&s;ine&s;s. Such, at lea&s;t, has been my ca&s;e.
A long while ago, when I contemplated the di&s;tant pro&s;pect of my
work, I gave you and my&s;elf &s;ome hopes of landing in England la&s;t
autumn; but, alas! when autumn grew near, hills began to ri&s;e on
hills, Alps on Alps, and I found my journey far more tedious and
toil&s;ome than I had imagined. When I look back on the length of
the undertaking, and the variety of materials, I cannot accu&s;e, or
&s;uffer my&s;elf to be accu&s;ed of idlene&s;s; yet it appeared that unle&s;s I
doubled my diligence, another year, and perhaps more, would elap&s;e
before I could embark with my complete manu&s;cript. Under the&s;e
circum&s;tances I took, and am &s;till executing, a bold and meritorious
re&s;olution. The mornings in winter, and in a country of early
dinners, are very conci&s;e; to them, my u&s;ual period of &s;tudy, I
now frequently add the evenings, renounce cards and &s;ociety, refu&s;e
the mo&s;t agreeable evenings, or perhaps make my appearance at a
late &s;upper. By this extraordinary indu&s;try, which I never prac|ti&s;ed
before, and to which I hope never to be again reduced, I &s;ee the
la&s;t part of my Hi&s;tory growing apace under my hands; all my
materials are collected and arranged; I can exactly compute, by the
&s;quare foot, or the &s;quare page, all that remains to be done; and af|ter
concluding text and notes, after a general review of my time
<PB N="669" REF="690">
and my ground, I now can deci&s;ively a&s;certain the final period of
the Decline and Fall, and can boldly promi&s;e that I will dine with
you at Sheffield-Place in the month of Augu&s;t, or perhaps of July,
in the pre&s;ent year; within le&s;s than a twelvemonth of the term
which I had loo&s;ely and originally fixed; and perhaps it would not
be ea&s;y to find a work of that &s;ize and importance in which the
workman has &s;o tolerably kept his word with him&s;elf and the public.
But in this &s;ituation, oppre&s;&s;ed with this particular object, and &s;teal|ing
every hour from my amu&s;ement, to the fatigue of the pen, and
the eyes, you will conceive, or you might conceive, how little &s;to|mach
I have for the epi&s;tolary &s;tyle; and that in&s;tead of idle, though
friendly, corre&s;pondence, I think it far more agreeable to employ
my time in the effectual mea&s;ures that may ha&s;ten and exhilarate our
per&s;onal interview. About a month ago I had a voluntary, and not
unplea&s;ing, epi&s;tle from Cadell; he informs me that he is going to
print a new octavo edition, the former being exhau&s;ted, and that the
public expect with impatience the conclu&s;ion of that excellent work,
who&s;e reputation increa&s;es every day, &amp;c. I an&s;wered him by the
return of the po&s;t, to inform him of the period and extent of my
labours, and to expre&s;s a rea&s;onable hope that he would &s;et the &s;ame
value on the three la&s;t as he had done on the three former volumes.
Should we conclude in this ea&s;y manner a tran&s;action &s;o honourable
to the author and book&s;eller, my way is clear and open before me;
in pecuniary matters I think I am a&s;&s;ured for the re&s;t of my life of
never troubling my friends, or being troubled my&s;elf; a &s;tate to
which I a&s;pire, and which I indeed de&s;erve, if not by my manage|ment,
at lea&s;t by moderation.</P>
<P>In your la&s;t, you talk more of the French treaty than of your&s;elf
and your wife and family; a true Engli&s;h <HI>quid nunc!</HI> For my part,
in this remote, inland, neutral country, you will &s;uppo&s;e, that after
a &s;light glance on the papers, I have neither had the means nor the
inclination to think very deeply about it. As a citizen of the world,
<PB N="670" REF="691">
a character to which I am every day ri&s;ing or &s;inking, I mu&s;t rejoice
in every agreement that dimini&s;hes the &s;eparation between neigh|bouring
countries, which &s;oftens their prejudices, unites their in|tere&s;ts
and indu&s;try, and renders their future ho&s;tilities le&s;s frequent
and le&s;s implacable. With regard to the pre&s;ent treaty, I hope both
nations are gainers; &s;ince otherwi&s;e it cannot be la&s;ting; and &s;uch
double mutual gain is &s;urely po&s;&s;ible in fair trade, though it could
not ea&s;ily happen in the mi&s;chievous amu&s;ements of war and gaming.
* * *
What a delightful hand have the&s;e great
&s;tate&s;men made of it &s;ince my departure! without power, and, as
far as I can &s;ee, without hope. When we meet I &s;hall advi&s;e you
to dige&s;t all your political and commercial knowledge, (England, Ire|land,
France, America,) and, with &s;ome attention to &s;tyle and order,
to make the whole a cla&s;&s;ic book, which may pre&s;erve your name
and benefit your country. I know not whether you have &s;een Sir
Henry Clinton &s;ince his return: he pa&s;&s;ed a day with me, and
&s;eemed plea&s;ed with my reception and place. We talked over you
and the American war. I embrace the <HI>&s;ilent my Lady</HI> and the two
honourable Mi&s;&s;es, whom I &s;igh to behold and admire. Adieu.
Ever yours.</P>
<P>Though I can part with land, you find I cannot part with books:
the remainder of my library has &s;o long embarra&s;&s;ed your room,
that it may now await my pre&s;ence and final judgment. Has my
Lady read a novel intitled Caroline de Litchfield, of our home ma|nufacture;
I may &s;ay of ours, &s;ince Deyverdun and my&s;elf were
the judges and patrons of the manu&s;cript. The author, who is &s;ince
married a &s;econd time, (Madame de Crou&s;az, now Montolieu,) is a
charming woman. I was in &s;ome danger. Once more, bar a long
fit of the gout, and the Hi&s;torian will land at Dover before the end
of July. Adieu.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>February 24th, 1787.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM perfectly &s;atisfied with your's and Mr. Strahan's cheerful and
liberal a&s;&s;ent to my propo&s;al, and am glad to find that your part|ner
has not degenerated from his worthy father, who&s;e lo&s;s I &s;in|cerely
lament. The &s;ole remaining difficulty (of the volumes falling
below the guinea price) it is unnece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent to di&s;cu&s;s,
as I think it unlikely to happen. As I am re&s;olved to fini&s;h and revi&s;e
the work before I leave Lau&s;anne, it will depend on your&s;elf to ar|range
your preparations of paper, &amp;c. in &s;uch a manner that we
may lo&s;e no time, but go to pre&s;s the fir&s;t week after my arrival.
But in the mean while I wi&s;h you to reflect and inquire; 1&s;t, In
how many months the impre&s;&s;ion of the three volumes may be com|pleted,
either with ordinary or extraordinary diligence. And,
2dly, How late in next year you would be de&s;irous or willing to
publi&s;h. On my revi&s;al I may find more alterations and improve|ments
to make than I at pre&s;ent fore&s;ee; I may be di&s;abled by a fit
of the gout; and your &s;peedy an&s;wer will inform me of the utmo&s;t
latitude in which I may be indulged, without totally di&s;concerting our
common intere&s;t. You probably agree with me in the nece&s;&s;ity of
a good general index for the &s;ix volumes. If you are po&s;&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
an intelligent workman, he might without delay take in hand the
fir&s;t three volumes; but in that ca&s;e I mu&s;t de&s;ire him to &s;end me as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible a <HI>&s;hort</HI> &s;pecimen by the po&s;t. I have thought on the
&s;ubject of index-making, and can give him &s;ome advice, which will
abridge the &s;ize, without impairing the u&s;e and value of his alpha|betical
table. By a letter of the thirteenth in&s;tant, Elm&s;ley informs
me that he is on the point of &s;ending the books; and I hope to
<PB N="672" REF="693">
have them here before the end of next month. I propo&s;e writing
to him very &s;oon; but as the events of life are uncertain, it may be
&s;afer to an&s;wer his que&s;tion through your channel: <Q>The author of
Caroline (Madame de Crou&s;az) is now become Madame la Ba|ronne
de Montolieu by &s;econd marriage, and has other cares and
plea&s;ures be&s;ides tho&s;e of writing. Her pen is not idle, but her
new &s;chemes of romance are not in any degree of forwardne&s;s
or maturity. Perhaps an hand&s;ome propo&s;al from an Engli&s;h
book&s;eller might &s;timulate her diligence.</Q> I am &s;incerely yours.</P>
<P>In our &s;tyle of negociation it is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to &s;ay that I

<P>I BEGIN to di&s;cover that if I wait till I could atchieve a ju&s;t and
&s;atisfactory epi&s;tle, equally plea&s;ant and in&s;tructive, you would
have a poor chance of hearing from me. I will therefore content

you repeat with &s;ome impatience: "When may we expect you in

&s;ome &s;light ornaments, the painting and glazing of the la&s;t fini&s;hed

re&s;idence of Sheffield-Place. It is therefore my &s;incere and peremp|tory
intention to depart from Lau&s;anne about the twentieth of July,

the gout, the capricious tyrant, who obeys no laws either of time
or place; and &s;o unfortunately are we circum&s;tanced, that &s;uch a fit,

coming till next &s;pring; &s;ince thereby I &s;hould lo&s;e the &s;ea&s;on, the
mon&s;oon, for the impre&s;&s;ion of three quarto volumes, which will
require nine months (a regular parturition), and cannot advantage|ou&s;ly
appear after the beginning or middle of May. At the &s;ame
time do not be apprehen&s;ive that I mean to play you a dog's trick.
From a thou&s;and motives it is my wi&s;h to come over this year: the
de&s;ire of &s;eeing you, and the <HI>&s;ilent &s;ullen</HI> my Lady; the family ar|rangements,
di&s;charge of &s;ervants, which I have already made; the
&s;trong wi&s;h of &s;ettling my three younge&s;t children in a manner
honourable to them and beneficial to their parents. Much mi&s;cella|neous
matter ri&s;es to my pen, but I will not be tempted to turn the
leaf. Expect me therefore at Sheffield-Place, with &s;trong probability,
about the fifteenth of Augu&s;t. Adieu. Yours.</P>

<P>THE twentieth of July is pa&s;t, and I am &s;till at Lau&s;anne; but
the march of heavy bodies, &s;uch as armies and hi&s;torians, can
&s;eldom be fore&s;een or fixed to a preci&s;e day. Some particular rea|&s;ons

of my departure is now (<HI>I believe</HI>) determined for Sunday the twenty-ninth

Engli&s;h traveller, and my &s;ervant is not accu&s;tomed to ride po&s;t. I
was never fond of deeds of darkne&s;s, and if the weather be hot, we
mu&s;t repo&s;e in the middle of the day. Yet the roads are in general
good: between &s;un and &s;un the interval is long; and, barring the
accidents of winds and waves, I think it po&s;&s;ible to reach London
in ten or twelve days; <HI>viz.</HI> on or before the ninth of Augu&s;t. With
<PB N="674" REF="695">
your active &s;pirit, you will &s;carce under&s;tand how I can look on this
ea&s;y journey with &s;ome degree of reluctance and apprehen&s;ion; but
after a tranquil &s;edentary life of four years, (having lain but a &s;ingle
night out of my own bed,) I &s;ee mountains and mon&s;ters in the
way; and &s;o happy do I feel my&s;elf <HI>at home,</HI> that nothing but the
&s;tronge&s;t calls of friend&s;hip and intere&s;t could drag me from hence.
You ingeniou&s;ly propo&s;e that I &s;hould turn off at Sittingbourn, and
&s;eem to wonder what bu&s;ine&s;s I can find, or make, for an immediate
re&s;idence in the capital. Have you totally forgot that I bring over
three quarto voumes for the pre&s;s? and are you ignorant that not a
moment mu&s;t be lo&s;t, if we are de&s;irous of appearing at a proper &s;ea&s;on;
and that I mu&s;t &s;et the machine in motion before I can &s;ecede to Shef|field-Place with an ea&s;y mind, and for a rea&s;onable term? Of this be
a&s;&s;ured, that I &s;hall not be le&s;s impatient than your&s;elf, and that, of hu|man
two-legged animals, your&s;elf and yours are the fir&s;t whom I &s;hall
wi&s;h to &s;ee in England. For my&s;elf, I do not regret the occupancy
of Downing-&s;treet; in my fir&s;t vi&s;it to London, a lodging or hotel
in the Adelphi will be more convenient; but I have &s;ome anxiety
about my books, and mu&s;t try whether I can approach tho&s;e holy
relics, without offending the delicacy of an amiable Duche&s;s. Our
interview is &s;o near, that I have little more to add, except a caution
about my own concerns, in which you will confe&s;s, that from&mdash;,
and&mdash;, to&mdash;, I have been generally unlucky. If any thing
remains, pre&s;ent or future, it mu&s;t be agitated and decided; but all
retro&s;pects are u&s;ele&s;s and painful, and we have &s;o many plea&s;ant

<P>ALAS! alas! alas! How vain and fallacious are all the de&s;igns of

month &s;ince my departure from Sheffield-Place; and it was firmly
my wi&s;h, my hope, my re&s;olution, that after di&s;patching &s;ome need|ful
bu&s;ine&s;s in London, and accompli&s;hing a pious duty at Bath, I
<PB N="677" REF="698">
&s;hould by this day be re&s;tored to the tranquil lei&s;ure, and friendly
&s;ociety, of Sheffield-Place. A cruel tyrant has di&s;concerted all my
plans; my bu&s;ine&s;s in town has been neglected, my attendance at
Bath is ju&s;t begun, and my return is yet di&s;tant. I was not a little
edified to hear of &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of regret and di&s;content on my
departure; and though I am not able to produce as good evidence,
you will perhaps believe that in the &s;olitude of a London lodging I
often railed at the gout for maliciou&s;ly delaying his attack till I was
removed from a place where my &s;ufferings would have been allevi|ated
by every kind and comfortable attention. I grew at la&s;t &s;o
de&s;perately impatient, as to re&s;olve on immediate flight, without
waiting till I had totally expelled the foe, and recovered my &s;trength.
I performed the journey with tolerable ea&s;e, but the motion has agi|tated
the remains of the humour. I am very lame, and a &s;econd
fit may po&s;&s;ibly be the puni&s;hment of my ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>As yet I have &s;een nothing of Bath except Mrs. G&mdash;; and weak|ne&s;s,
as well as propriety, will confine me very clo&s;ely to her. Lord

We begin to throw out hints of the &s;hortne&s;s of our &s;tay, and in|di&s;pen&s;able

it is re&s;olved in our cabinet to leave Bath on Thur&s;day the twenty-&s;ixth,
and pa&s;&s;ing through Lord Loughborough's and town, to &s;ettle
at Sheffield-Place, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, before the end of the year. For
my own part I can &s;ay with truth, that did not the pre&s;s loudly de|mand
my pre&s;ence, I could, without a &s;igh, allow the Duche&s;s to
reign in Downing-&s;treet the greate&s;t part of the winter, and &s;hould

<P>THOUGH you have now been &s;ome time in London, yet as I heard
of your welfare by different channels, and as I know from expe|rience
how much a man has to do who is printing three quartos, even
after he thinks they are altogether ready for the pre&s;s, I have hitherto
forborne to interrupt you by any letter or inquiry of mine. But
there is &s;uch a general impatience to &s;ee your new publication among
people of letters here; and, as your friend, I am &s;o frequently in|terrogated
about the length it has advanced, and the time when it
will appear, that I begin to be a&s;hamed of knowing nothing more
about it than other people. I mu&s;t reque&s;t of you then to furni&s;h
me with &s;uch information as may both pre&s;erve my credit, and gra|tify
my own curio&s;ity. My expectations from this part of your
work are, indeed, very high. Your materials begin to improve, and
are certainly much more copious than during a great part of the pe|riod
you have gone through. You have three or four events as
great, and &s;plendid, and &s;ingular, as the heart of an hi&s;torian could
wi&s;h to delineate. The contemporary writers will furni&s;h you with
all the nece&s;&s;ary facts. To adorn them as elegant writers, or to ac|count
for them as philo&s;ophers, never entered into their heads. This
they have left to you.</P>
<P>Since you went to the continent I have not done &s;o much as I
wi&s;hed. My health, until lately, has been more &s;hattered; and as
I advance in life, (I am now &s;ixty-&s;ix,) though my faculties, I ima|gine,
are &s;till entire, yet I find my mind le&s;s active and ardent. I
have, however, fini&s;hed a very careful revi&s;e of all my works, and
have given them the la&s;t poli&s;h they will receive from my hand. I
<PB N="679" REF="700">
have made &s;ome additions to each of them, and in the Hi&s;tory of
Scotland pretty con&s;iderable ones. I have de&s;ired Mr. Strahan to
&s;end to you a copy of them uniformly bound, and hope you will
accept of them, as a memorial of my e&s;teem and affection. You
will &s;ee that I have got in Mr. Whitaker an adver&s;ary &s;o bigotted
and zealous, that though I have denied no article of faith, and am
at lea&s;t as orthodox as he him&s;elf, yet he rails again&s;t me with all
the a&s;perity of theological hatred. I &s;hall adhere to my fixed
maxim of making no reply. May I hope that when you &s;ee Lord
Loughborough you will remember me to him with kindne&s;s and re|&s;pect.
Our friend Mr. Smith, whom we were in great danger of

an indi&s;pen&s;able tribute. This day, at length, after long delay
and frequent expo&s;tulation, I have received the writings, which I
am now in the act of &s;igning, &s;ealing, and delivering, according to
the lawyer's directions. * * *
I long to be at Sheffield-Place. You
&s;ee my departure is not po&s;tponed a moment by idlene&s;s or plea&s;ure,
but the preci&s;e day &s;till hangs on contingencies, and we mu&s;t all be
patient, if our wi&s;hes &s;hould be thwarted. I &s;ay our wi&s;hes, for I
&s;incerely de&s;ire to be with you. I have had many dinners, &s;ome
&s;plendid and memorable, with Ha&s;tings la&s;t Thur&s;day, with the
Prince of Wales next Tue&s;day at Craufurd's. But the town empties,
Texier is &s;ilent, and in an evening, I <HI>de&s;iderate</HI> the re&s;ources of a
<PB N="680" REF="701">
family or a club. Caplin has fini&s;hed the Herculean labour, and
&s;even maje&s;tic boxes will abdicate on Monday your hall. Severy
has likewi&s;e di&s;patched his affairs, and &s;ecured his companion Clarke,
who is arrived in town; but his &s;chemes are abridged by the inexo|rable
rigour of Lord Howe, who has a&s;&s;ured our great and fair in|terce&s;&s;ors,
that by the King's order the dock-yards are &s;hut again&s;t
all &s;trangers. We therefore give up Port&s;mouth, and content our|&s;elves
with two &s;hort trips; one to Stowe and Oxford, the other to
Chatham; and if we can catch a launch and review, <HI>encore vit on.</HI>
He (Severy, not Lord Howe,) &s;alutes with me the family. Adieu.
Yours.</P>

<P>ACCORDING to your imperious law I write a line, to po&s;tpone
my arrival till Friday, or perhaps Saturday, but I hope Friday,
and I promi&s;e you that not a moment &s;hall be wa&s;ted. And now let

fixed between the tenth and fifteenth of July. After a full and
free enjoyment of each other's &s;ociety, let us &s;ubmit, without a
&s;truggle, to rea&s;on and fate. It would be idle to pretend bu&s;ine&s;s at
Lau&s;anne; but a complete year will elap&s;e before my return. Severy

clo&s;ed for this year. Sheridan &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; and though I am
far from con&s;idering him as a perfect orator, there were many beau|tiful
pa&s;&s;ages in his &s;peech, on ju&s;tice, filial love, &amp;c.; one of
the clo&s;e&s;t chains of argument I ever heard, to prove that Ha&s;tings
was re&s;pon&s;ible for the acts of Middleton; and a compliment, much
admired, to a certain Hi&s;torian of your acquaintance. Sheridan, in
the clo&s;e of his &s;peech, &s;unk into Burke's arms; but I called this
morning, he is perfectly well. I fear that I &s;hall not be able to dine
at home a &s;ingle day. To-morrow Severy and my&s;elf go to Bu&s;hy.

<OPENER><DATELINE>COLLEGE of EDINBURGH, <DATE>July 30th, 1788.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LONG before this I &s;hould have acknowledged the receipt of your
mo&s;t acceptable pre&s;ent; but for &s;everal weeks I have been af|flicted
with a violent fit of deafne&s;s, and that un&s;ocial malady is always
<PB N="682" REF="703">
accompanied with &s;uch a degree of languor, as renders even the
writing of a letter an effort. During my &s;olitude the peru&s;al of your
book has been my chief amu&s;ement and con&s;olation. I have gone
through it once with great attention, and am now advanced to the
la&s;t volume in my &s;econd reading. I ventured to predict the &s;uperior
excellence of the volumes lately publi&s;hed, and I have not been a
fal&s;e prophet. Indeed, when I con&s;ider the extent of your under|taking,
and the immen&s;e labour of hi&s;torical and philo&s;ophic re|&s;earch
requi&s;ite towards executing every part of it, I am a&s;toni&s;hed
that all this &s;hould have been accompli&s;hed by one man. I know
no example, in any age or nation, of &s;uch a va&s;t body of valuable
and elegant information communicated by any individual. I feel,
however, &s;ome degree of mortification mingled with my a&s;toni&s;h|ment.
Before you began your hi&s;toric career, I u&s;ed to pride my&s;elf
in being at lea&s;t the mo&s;t indu&s;trious hi&s;torian of the age; but now,
alas! I can pretend no longer even to that prai&s;e, and mu&s;t &s;ay, as
Pliny did of his uncle, <HI>Si comparer illi &s;um de&s;idio&s;i&s;&s;imus.</HI> Your
&s;tyle appears to me improved in the&s;e new volumes; by the habit
of writing, you write with greater ea&s;e. I am &s;orry to find that our
ideas on the effects of the Cru&s;ades do not altogether coincide. I
con&s;idered that point with great care, and cannot help thinking &s;till
that my opinion was well founded. I &s;hall con&s;ult the autho|rities
to which I refer; for when my &s;entiments differ from yours,
I have &s;ome rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t them, and I may po&s;&s;ibly trouble you
with a letter on the &s;ubject. I am much flattered with the manner
in which you have &s;o often mentioned my name. <HI>Laetus &s;um lau|dari
a te landato viro.</HI> I feel much &s;atisfaction in having been di|&s;tingui&s;hed
by the two hi&s;torians of my own times, who&s;e favour|able
opinion I was mo&s;t ambitious of obtaining.</P>
<P>I hope this letter may find you &s;till in England. When you re|turn
to Lau&s;anne, permit me to recommend to your good office my
younge&s;t &s;on, who is now at Yverdun on account of his health, and
lives with M. Herman, a clergyman there. You will find the
<PB N="683" REF="704">
young man (if you can rely on the partial te&s;timony of a father)
&s;en&s;ible, mode&s;t, and well-bred, and though no great &s;cholar, he
has &s;een much; having returned from India, where he &s;erved la&s;t
war, by Ba&s;&s;ora, Bagdat, Mou&s;&s;ul, and Aleppo. He is now a Cap|tain
in the twenty-third regiment. If you have any friend at Yver|dun,
be &s;o good as to recommend him. It will do him credit
to have your countenance. I have de&s;ired him to pay his re&s;pects
to you at Lau&s;anne. Farewell, my dear Sir. I ever am yours mo&s;t

<P>I SHOULD be much more a&s;hamed of my &s;ilence, were I not &s;ati&s;|fied
that you have received a recent and favourable account of me
from &s;ome of our friends who have vi&s;ited this place &s;ince my re|turn.
<PB N="684" REF="705">
But I &s;hould be inexcu&s;able, did I not thank you for your
kind and &s;ea&s;onable wi&s;hes, which I can return with equal &s;incerity.
I do not propo&s;e making any improvements or corrections in the
octavo edition which you meditate: &s;ome &s;light alterations would give
me more trouble than plea&s;ure. A thorough revi&s;ion of the whole
work would be the labour of many months; it may be the amu&s;e|ment
of my old age, and will be a valuable legacy, to renew your
copy-right at the expiration of the la&s;t fourteen years. In the mean
while, &s;ome expedition may be u&s;eful to guard your property from
the unexpected inva&s;ion of <HI>foreign</HI> pirates. Eight volumes in octavo
are already printed at Ba&s;il, and the remainder is expected every day.
I am both glad and &s;orry to inform you, that the type is neat, the
paper tolerable, and the text <HI>wonderfully</HI> correct. I hear of another
Engli&s;h edition in Saxony, and of two French tran&s;lations advancing
with &s;peed and emulation at Paris. Of the &s;ucce&s;s of the work at
home you are be&s;t qualified, and mo&s;t intere&s;ted, to judge; and I
am happy to find that you expre&s;s your&s;elf, with &s;ome re&s;erve, &s;ati&s;|fied
with the &s;ale. From &s;ome reports of angry critici&s;ms, and from
the u&s;e and abu&s;e of my name in the papers, I perceive that I am
not forgotten. Before a year has elap&s;ed from the time of publica|tion,
my Hi&s;tory will have been peru&s;ed by &s;ome thou&s;and readers
of various characters and under&s;tandings. Each will probably find
&s;omething to blame, and I hope &s;omething to commend; and the
balance of their private judgments will fix the public e&s;timate of its
merit and reputation. Since my return I have been, as I promi&s;e
in the preface, very bu&s;y an very idle in my library: &s;everal ideal
works have been embraced and thrown a&s;ide; but if the warm
weather &s;hould ripen any project to form and maturity, you may
depend on the earlie&s;t intelligence. I have received a very friendly
and flattering letter from Dr. Robert&s;on, and have had the plea&s;ure
of &s;hewing &s;ome civilities to his &s;on during his re&s;idence in this
place. If you can, &s;end me a good account of Adam Smith; there
<PB N="685" REF="706">
is no man more &s;incerely intere&s;ted in his welfare than my&s;elf. I

<P>I RECEIVED with more concern than &s;urprize, your kind notification
of my poor uncle's departure. My own knowledge of his many
valuable qualities teaches me to &s;ympathize in your lo&s;s; but his long

<P>I SHOULD indeed be inexcu&s;able for my long neglect of your
la&s;t obliging letter, had it not reached me in a moment of pain
and weakne&s;s, in a &s;it of the gout, the longe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;evere that
I have ever known. A letter with me is no trifling enterprize;
and before I could find &s;trength, and time, and re&s;olution, the oc|ca&s;ion
on which you &s;o hand&s;omely con&s;ulted me was already pa&s;t.
I &s;uppo&s;e that the abridgment of my Hi&s;tory is now freely circu|lated,
either with or without your name; nor can I fore&s;ee any
po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chief, either for <HI>my</HI> reputation or <HI>your</HI> intere&s;t. A tran&s;|lation,
an abridgment, or even a critici&s;m, always proves the &s;ucce&s;s,
and con&s;equently extends the &s;ale, of any popular work.</P>
<P>As I am inclined to flatter my&s;elf that you have no rea&s;on to be
di&s;plea&s;ed with your purcha&s;e, I now wi&s;h to a&s;k you whether you
feel your&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to add a &s;eventh, or &s;upplemental volume to
my Hi&s;tory? The materials of which it will be compo&s;ed will
naturally be cla&s;&s;ed under the three following heads: 1. A &s;eries
of fragments, di&s;qui&s;itions, digre&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. more or le&s;s connected
with the principal &s;ubject. 2. Several tables of geography, chro|nology,
coins, weights and mea&s;ures, &amp;c.; nor &s;hould I de&s;pair of
obtaining from a gentleman at Paris &s;ome accurate and well-adapted
maps. 3. A critical review of all the authors whom I have u&s;ed
and quoted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gibbon &s;oon became tired of this plan, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h it had not been mentioned. He &s;aid his Hi&s;tory was a critical review of the authors he had u&s;ed. S.</NOTE>. I am convinced &s;uch a &s;upplement might be rendered
entertaining, as well as u&s;eful; and that few purcha&s;ers would refu&s;e
<PB N="687" REF="708">
to <HI>complete</HI> their Decline and Fall. But as the writer could not derive
either fame or amu&s;ement from the&s;e ob&s;cure labours, he mu&s;t be
encouraged by other motives; and, in plain Engli&s;h, I &s;hould expect
the &s;ame reward for the &s;eventh, as for any of the preceding vo|lumes.
You think and act with too much liberality, to confound
&s;uch a large original &s;upplement with the occa&s;ional improvements
of a new edition, which are already your property by the terms of
our former convenant. But as I am jealous of &s;tanding clear, not
only in law and equity, but in your e&s;teem and my own, I &s;hall
in&s;tantly renounce the undertaking, if it appears by your an&s;wer
that you have the &s;hadow of an objection. Should you tempt me
to proceed, this &s;upplement will be only the employment of my
lei&s;ure hours; and I fore&s;ee that full two years will elap&s;e before I
can deliver it into the hands of the printer.</P>
<P>Our friend Elm&s;ley, who po&s;&s;ibly thinks me dead and buried, will
be, or will not be, &s;urprized when you inform him that I have now
a letter of two pages in my bureau addre&s;&s;ed to him, dated the twenty-&s;ixth
of May, and not yet fini&s;hed. Hunger, literary hunger, will
&s;oon, however, compel me to write; as I have many que&s;tions to
a&s;k, and many commi&s;&s;ions to give. In the mean while I thir&s;t for
Mr. Burke's Reflections on the Revolutions of France. Intreat
Elm&s;ley, in my name, to di&s;patch it to Lau&s;anne with care and

may add to the parcel the new edition of Adam Smith's Theory of
Moral Sentiments. I heard of his death with more concern than
&s;urprize. What a lo&s;s to letters, philo&s;ophy, and mankind!</P>
<P>I beg you would remember me to Mr. Strahan and all our friends.
In my happy exile, my public and private affections remind me that
I am an Engli&s;hman. Pray thank Dr. Moore, in my name, for the
plea&s;ure which I have received from Zeluco, the be&s;t philo&s;ophical

<P>AS much as I am accu&s;tomed to my own &s;ins, I am &s;hocked,
really &s;hocked, when I think of my long and mo&s;t inex|cu&s;able

to the be&s;t and deare&s;t of my friends, who indeed has been very
&s;eldom out of my thoughts. I have &s;ometimes imagined that if the
opportunities of writing occurred le&s;s frequently, they would be
&s;eized with more diligence; but the unfortunate departure of the
po&s;t twice every week encourages procra&s;tination, and each &s;hort
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive delay is indulged without &s;eruple, till the whole has &s;welled

I am afraid that writing grows painful to you, I have the confidence
to &s;olicit a <HI>&s;peedy line,</HI> to &s;ay that you love and forgive me. After a
long experience of the unfeeling doubts and delays of the law, you will
probably &s;oon hear from Lord Sheffield that the Beriton tran&s;action

to enjoy it is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;incere wi&s;h of my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="690" REF="711">
In the placid cour&s;e of our lives, at Lau&s;anne and Bath, we have
few events to relate, and fewer changes to de&s;cribe; but I indulge
my&s;elf in the plea&s;ing belief that we are both as well and as happy
as the common order of nature will allow us to expect. I &s;hould be
&s;atisfied, had I received from time to time &s;ome indirect, but agree|able,
information of your health. For my&s;elf, I have no complaint,
except the gout; and though the vi&s;its of my old enemy are &s;ome|what
longer, and more enfeebling, they are con&s;ined to my feet and
knees; the pain is moderate, and my impri&s;onment to my chamber,
or my chair, is much alleviated by the daily kindne&s;s of my friends.
I wi&s;h it were in my power to give you an adequate idea of the con|veniency
of my hou&s;e, and the beauty of my garden; both of
which I have improved at a con&s;iderable expence &s;ince the death of
poor Deyverdun. But the lo&s;s of a friend is indeed irreparable.
Were I ten years younger, I might po&s;&s;ibly think of a female com|panion;
but the choice is difficult, the &s;ucce&s;s doubtful, the engage|ment
perpetual, and at fifty-four a man &s;hould never think of alter|ing
the whole &s;y&s;tem of his life and habits. The di&s;po&s;al of Beri|ton,
and the death of my aunt He&s;ter, who has left me her e&s;tate
in Su&s;&s;ex, makes me very ea&s;y in my worldly affairs: my income is
equal to my expence, and my expence is adequate to my wi&s;hes.
You may po&s;&s;ibly have heard of literary projects which are a&s;cribed
to me by the public without my knowledge: but it is much more
probable that I have clo&s;ed the account; and though I &s;hall never
lay a&s;ide the plea&s;ing occupations of &s;tudy, you may be a&s;&s;ured that
I have no &s;erious &s;ettled thoughts of a new work. Next year I
&s;hall meditate, and I tru&s;t &s;hall execute, a vi&s;it to England, in which
the Belvidere is one of my powerful load&s;tones. I often reflect
with a painful emotion on the imperious circum&s;tances which have
thrown us at &s;uch a di&s;tance from each other.</P>
<P>In the moving picture of the world, you cannot be indifferent
to the &s;trange revolution which has humbled all that was high, and
exalted all that was low, in France. The irregular and lively &s;pirit
<PB N="691" REF="712">
of the nation has di&s;graced their liberty, and in&s;tead of building a
free con&s;titution, they have only exchanged de&s;poti&s;m for anarchy.
This town and country are crowded with noble exiles; and we
&s;ometimes count in an a&s;&s;embly a dozen Prince&s;&s;es and Duche&s;&s;es.
Burke, if I remember right, is no favourite of yours; but there is
&s;urely much eloquence and much &s;en&s;e in his book. The pro&s;perity
of England forms a proud contra&s;t with the di&s;orders of France; but
I hope we &s;hall avoid the folly of a Ru&s;&s;ian war. Pitt, in this in|&s;tance,
&s;eems too like his father. Mr. Helrard, a &s;en&s;ible man, and
his pupil have left us. They found, as your friends will always
find, the weight of your recommendation with me. I am, deare&s;t
Madam, ever mo&s;t affectionately yours.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LENNEL-HOUSE, <DATE>Augu&s;t 25th, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME time before the publication of my Hi&s;torical Di&s;qui&s;ition
concerning India I de&s;ired our friend Mr. Cadell to &s;end a copy
of it to you in my name. I hope you received it long ago, and
will allow it to remain in your library, as a memorial of my re&s;pect
and friend&s;hip. No man had formed a more decided re&s;olution of
retreating early from public view, and of &s;pending the eve of life in the
tranquillity of profe&s;&s;ional and dome&s;tic occupations; but, directly in
the face of that purpo&s;s, I &s;tep forth with a new work, when ju&s;t on
the brink of three&s;core and ten. The preface of the book gives a fair
and &s;imple account how this happened. Hitherto I have no cau&s;e to
repent of a &s;tep which I took with he&s;itation and anxiety. My book
has met with a reception beyond what the <HI>&s;pe lenius, pavidu&s;que
futuri,</HI> dared to expect. I find, however, like other parents, that I
have a partial fondne&s;s for this child of my old age; and cannot &s;et
<PB N="692" REF="713">
my heart quite at ea&s;e, until I know your opinion of it. I need
not &s;ay with what perfect confidence I re&s;t upon your judgment, and
how happy it will make me to find that this production meets with
your approbation. Nothing will add &s;o much to that plea&s;ure, as
your communicating to me any remarks that occurred to you in per|u&s;ing
it. While I was engaged in compo&s;ing the Di&s;qui&s;ition it often
occurred to me, that I was more upon your ground than in any of my
former works; and I often wi&s;hed that I had been &s;o near to you as
to profit by your advice and information. Next to that will be the
benefit I may derive from your friendly &s;trictures. Be &s;o kind then
as to mention to me any error or omi&s;&s;ion you have ob&s;erved; every
critici&s;m of yours will be in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>Permit me to reque&s;t another favour. You allowed me to hope,
that as &s;oon as you fixed upon a new &s;ubject you would let me
know, and give me the &s;atisfaction of indulging the hopes of living
until you fini&s;hed it. I tru&s;t that you are not idle &s;till. I may now
tell you with authority, that you are yet far from that period of life
when you &s;hould lay down your pen. I can &s;ay from experience,
that the bu&s;ie&s;t &s;ea&s;on of life is the mo&s;t happy; and I have no doubt
that you will concur with me in this &s;entiment. Let me know then,
my dear Sir, how you are, what you are doing, and what progre&s;s
you make. As for my part, I enjoy good health; and, except &s;ome
fits of deafne&s;s, am little troubled with the infirmities of old age. I
write this at my &s;on-in-law's, Mr. Brydone, who, if he had not a
wife and family, loves Switzerland &s;o well, and has &s;o many friends
in Lau&s;anne, that I believe he would gladly join you there. Believe
me to be, with great re&s;pect, your mo&s;t faithful and obedient &s;ervant,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>Augu&s;t 1&s;t, 1792.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>MY DEAREST MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the arts of our great enemy, the daemon
of procra&s;tination, I &s;hould not have po&s;tponed for &s;o many
months a plea&s;ing duty, which may at any time be performed in a
&s;ingle hour, had I not for &s;ome time pa&s;t entertained a lively and
probable hope of vi&s;iting you this autumn in per&s;on; had I not
flattered my&s;elf, that the very next po&s;t I might be able to fix the
day of my departure from Lau&s;anne, and almo&s;t of my arrival at
the Belvidere. That hope is now vani&s;hed, and my journey to
England is unavoidably delayed till the &s;pring or &s;ummer of next
year. The extraordinary &s;tate of public affairs in France oppo&s;es an
in&s;uperable bar to my pa&s;&s;age; and every prudent &s;tranger will
avoid that inho&s;pitable land, in which a people of &s;laves is &s;uddenly
become a nation of tyrants and cannibals. The German road is in|deed
&s;afe, but, independent of a great addition of fatigue and ex|pence,
the armies of Au&s;tria and Pru&s;&s;ia now cover that frontier;
and though the generals are polite, and the troops well di&s;ciplined,
I am not de&s;irous of pa&s;&s;ing through the clouds of hu&s;&s;ars and pan|dours
that attend their motions. The&s;e public rea&s;ons are fortified
by &s;ome private motives, and to this delay I re&s;ign my&s;elf, with a
&s;igh for the pre&s;ent, and a hope for the future.</P>
<P>What a &s;trange wild world do we live in! You will allow me to
be a tolerable hi&s;torian, yet, on a fair review of ancient and modern
times, I can find none that bear any affinity with the pre&s;ent. My
knowledge of your di&s;cerning mind, and my recollection of your
political principles, a&s;&s;ure me, that you are no more a <HI>democrat</HI> than
my&s;elf. Had the French improved their glorious opportunity to
erect a free con&s;titutional monarchy on the ruins of arbitrary power
and the Ba&s;tille, I &s;hould applaud their generous effort; but this
<PB N="694" REF="715">
total &s;ubver&s;ion of all rank, order, and government could be produc|tive
only of a popular mon&s;ter, which, after devouring every thing
el&s;e, mu&s;t finally devour it&s;elf. I was once apprehen&s;ive that this
mon&s;ter would propagate &s;ome imps in our happy i&s;land, but they
&s;eem to have been cru&s;hed in their cradle; and I acknowledge with
plea&s;ure and pride the good &s;en&s;e of the Engli&s;h nation, who &s;eem
truly con&s;cious of the ble&s;&s;ings which they enjoy: and I am happy
to find that the mo&s;t re&s;pectable part of Oppo&s;ition has cordially
joined in the &s;upport of "things as they are." Even this country
has been &s;omewhat tainted with the democratical infection; the vigi|lance
of government has been exerted, the malecontents have been
awed, the mi&s;guided have been undeceived, the fever in the blood
has gradually &s;ub&s;ided, and I flatter my&s;elf that we have &s;ecured the
tranquil enjoyment of ob&s;cure felicity, which we had been almo&s;t
tempted to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>You have heard, mo&s;t probably, from Mrs. Holroyd, of the long|expected
though tran&s;ient &s;atisfaction which I received from the
vi&s;it of Lord Sheffield's family. He appeared highly &s;atisfied with
my arrangements here, my hou&s;e, garden, and &s;ituation, at once in
town and country, which are indeed &s;ingular in their kind, and
which have often made me regret the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;hewing them
to my deare&s;t friend of the Belvidere. Lord Sheffield is &s;till, and
will ever continue, the &s;ame active being; always employed for
him&s;elf, his friends, and the public, and always per&s;uading him&s;elf
that he wi&s;hes for lei&s;ure and repo&s;e. There are various roads
to happine&s;s; but when I compare his &s;ituation with mine, I do not,
upon the whole, repent that I have given the preference to a life of
celibacy and retirement. Although I have been long a &s;pectator of
the great world, my unambitious temper has been content with the
occupations and rewards of &s;tudy; and although my library be &s;till
my favourite room, I am now no longer &s;timulated by the pro&s;ecution
of any literary work. The &s;ociety of Lau&s;anne is adapted to my
ta&s;te; my hou&s;e is open to many agreeable acquaintance, and &s;ome
<PB N="695" REF="716">
real friends; the uniformity of the natives is enlivened by travellers of
all nations; and this &s;ummer I am happy in a familiar intercour&s;e
with Lady Spencer, the Duche&s;s of Devon&s;hire, Lady Elizabeth
Fo&s;ter, and Lady Duncannon, who &s;eems to be gradually recovering
from her &s;evere complaints. My health is remarkably good. I
have now enjoyed a long interval from the gout; and I endeavour
to u&s;e with moderation Dr. Cadogan's be&s;t remedies, temperance,
exerci&s;e, and cheerfulne&s;s. Adieu, dear Madam; may every ble&s;&s;|ing
that nature can allow be attendant on your latter &s;ea&s;on. Your
age and my habits will not permit a very clo&s;e corre&s;pondence;
but I wi&s;h to hear, and I <HI>pre&s;ume</HI> to a&s;k, a &s;peedy <HI>direct</HI> account of
your own &s;ituation. May it be &s;uch as I &s;hall hear with plea&s;ure!
Once more adieu; I live in hopes of embracing you next &s;ummer at
the Belvidere, but you may be a&s;&s;ured that I bring over nothing for

<P>I REMEMBER it has been ob&s;erved of Augu&s;tus and Cromwell, that
they &s;hould never have been born, or never have died; and I
am &s;ometimes tempted to apply the &s;ame remark to certain beings
of a &s;ofter nature, who, after a &s;hort re&s;idence on the banks of the
Leman Lake, are now flown far away over the Alps and the Ap|penines,
and have abandoned their votaries to the in&s;ipidity of com|mon
life. The remark, however, would be unrea&s;onable, and the
&s;entiment ungrateful. The plea&s;ures of the &s;ummer, the lighter and
the graver moments of the &s;ociety of <HI>petit Ouchy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A beautiful villa near the lake, about a mile from Lau&s;anne.</NOTE>, are indeed pa&s;t,
<PB N="696" REF="717">
perhaps never to return; but the remembrance of that delightful
period is it&s;elf a plea&s;ure, and I enjoy, I cheri&s;h the flattering per|&s;ua&s;ion
that it is remembered with &s;ome &s;atisfaction in the gallery of
Florence, as well as in <HI>the library</HI> of Lau&s;anne. Long before we
were reduced to &s;eek a refuge from the &s;avages of Gaul, I had &s;e|cretly
indulged the thought, or at lea&s;t the wi&s;h, of a&s;king leave to
attend <HI>mes bonnes amies</HI> over Mount Cenis, of ba&s;king once more in
an Italian &s;un, and of paying once more my devotions to the Apollo
of the Vatican. But my aged and gouty limbs would have failed
me in the bold attempt of &s;caling St. Bernard, and I wanted patience
to undertake the tedious circumitineration of the Tirol. Your re|turn
to the Pays de Vaud next &s;ummer I hold to be extremely doubt|ful;
but my anxiety on that head is &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed by the
&s;ure and certain hope of our all meeting in England the en&s;uing
winter. I flatter my&s;elf that the Porter of Devon&s;hire-hou&s;e will
not be inexorable; yet I am afraid of lo&s;ing you amid&s;t the &s;moke
and tumult of fa&s;hionable London, in which the night is devoted to
plea&s;ure and the morning to &s;leep. My ambition may perhaps a&s;pire
to pa&s;s &s;ome hours in the palladian Chi&s;wick, or even &s;ome days at
Chat&s;worth; but the&s;e princely man&s;ions will not recal the freedom,
the ea&s;e, the <HI>primitive</HI> &s;olitude of dear little Ouchy. Indeed! indeed!
your fair friend was made for &s;omething better than a Duche&s;s.</P>
<P>Although you mo&s;t magnanimou&s;ly abandoned us in the cri&s;is of
our fate, yet as you &s;eem to intere&s;t your&s;elf in the hopes and fears
of this little country, it is my duty to inform you, that we &s;till
hang in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e; inclining, however, to the &s;ide of hope,
rather than of de&s;pair. The garri&s;on, and even the bourgeoi&s;ie, of
Geneva &s;hewed a vigorous re&s;olution of defending the city; and our
frontiers have been gradually covered with fifteen thou&s;and intrepid
Swi&s;s. But the threats of a bombardment, the weight of expence,
and, above all, the victorious a&s;cendant of the French republic, have
abated much of the fir&s;t heroic ardour. Mon&s;ieur de Monte&s;quiou
<PB N="697" REF="718">
di&s;played a pacific, and even yielding, temper; and a treaty was
&s;igned, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the Swi&s;s garri&s;on from Geneva, and removing
the French troops to the di&s;tance of ten leagues. But this la&s;t con|dition,
which is indeed objectionable, di&s;plea&s;ed the convention,
who refu&s;ed to ratify the agreement. New conferences were held,
new me&s;&s;engers have been di&s;patched; but unle&s;s they are deter|mined
to find or to make a &s;ubject of quarrel, it is probable that we
&s;hall purcha&s;e peace by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. As Geneva has a very dangerous
democratical party within her walls, and as the national guards are
already allowed to enter the city, and to tamper with the inhabitants
and the garri&s;on, I will not en&s;ure that poor little republic from one
week to another. For our&s;elves, the approaches of danger mu&s;t be
more gradual. I think we are now &s;afe for this winter, and I no
longer run to the window to &s;ee whether the French are coming.
But with &s;o many enemies without, and &s;o many within, the go|vernment
of Bern, and the tranquillity of this happy country, will
be &s;u&s;pended by a very &s;lender twig; and I begin to fear that Satan
will drive me out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Paradi&s;e. My only comfort
will be, that I &s;hall have been expelled by the power, and not &s;educed
by the arts, of the blacke&s;t daemon in hell, the daemon of demo|cracy.
Where indeed will this tremendous inundation, this con|&s;piracy
of numbers again&s;t rank and property, be finally &s;topped.
Europe &s;eems to be univer&s;ally tainted, and wherever the French
can light a match, they may blow up a mine. Our only hope is
now in their devouring one another; they are furious and hungry
mon&s;ters, and war is almo&s;t declared between the convention and
the city of Paris, between the moderate republicans and the ab&s;olute
levellers. A majority of the convention wi&s;hes to &s;pare the royal
victims, but they mu&s;t yield to the rage of the people and the thir&s;t
of popularity, and a few hours may produce a trial, a &s;entence, and
a guillotine. Mr. Necker is publi&s;hing a pamphlet in defence of th&eacute;
augu&s;t &s;ufferers; but his feeble and tardy efforts will rather do credit
<PB N="698" REF="719">
to him&s;elf, than &s;ervice to his clients. You kindly a&s;k after the
&s;ituation of poor Severy. Alas! it is now hopele&s;s; all his com|plaints
are increa&s;ed, all his re&s;ources are exhau&s;ted; where nature
cannot work, the effect of art is vain, and his be&s;t friends begin to wi&s;h
him a quiet relea&s;e. His wife, I had almo&s;t &s;aid his widow, is truly
an object of compa&s;&s;ion. The dragoon is returned for a few days;
and if his dome&s;tic &s;orrows gave him leave, he would almo&s;t regret
the want of an occa&s;ion to de&s;erve his feather and cockade. Your
note has been communicated to Madame de Montelieu; but as &s;he
is engaged with a dying aunt, I have not yet &s;een her. Madame
Dagai&s;&s;eau has ha&s;tily left us; the la&s;t decrees &s;eemed to give the <HI>emi|gr&eacute;s</HI>
only the option of &s;tarving abroad or hanging at home; yet &s;he
has ventured into France, on &s;ome faint glimp&s;e of clemency for the
women and children. Madame de Bouillon does not appear to move.
Madame de Stael, whom I &s;aw la&s;t week at Rolle, is &s;till uncertain
where &s;he &s;hall drop her burthen; but &s;he mu&s;t &s;oon re&s;olve, for the
young lady or gentleman is at the door;
<Q>&mdash;Demanding life, impatient for the &s;kies.</Q>
By this time you have joined the Ladies Spencer and Duncannon,
whom I beg leave to &s;alute with the proper &s;hades of re&s;pect and
tenderne&s;s. You may, if you plea&s;e <HI>be, belle comme un ange;</HI> but
I do not like your compari&s;on of the archangel. Tho&s;e of Milton,
with whom I am better acquainted at pre&s;ent than with Guido, are
all ma&s;culine manly figures, with a great &s;word by their &s;ide, and
&s;ix wings folding round them. The heathen godde&s;&s;es would plea&s;e
me as little. Your friend is le&s;s &s;evere than Minerva, more decent
than Venus, le&s;s cold than Diana, and not quite &s;o great a vixen as
the ox-eyed Juno. To expre&s;s that infallible mixture of grace,
&s;weetne&s;s, and dignity, a new race of beings mu&s;t be invented, and
I am a mere pro&s;e narrator of matter of fact. Be&s;s is much nearer
the level of a mortal, but a mortal for whom the wi&s;e&s;t man, hi&s;|toric
<PB N="699" REF="720">
or medical, would throw away two or three worlds, if he had
them in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. From the afore&s;aid Be&s;s I have received
three marks of kind remembrance, from the foot of St. Bernard,
with an exqui&s;ite monument of art and friend&s;hip, from Turin,
and finally from Milan, with a mo&s;t valuable in&s;ertion from the
Duche&s;s. At birds in the air it is difficult to take aim, and I fear
or hope that I &s;hall &s;u&s;tain &s;ome reproaches on your not finding this
long epi&s;tle at Florence. I will mark it N^o 1.; and why &s;hould
I de&s;pair of my future &s;ince I can &s;ay with truth, that &s;ince
your departure I have not &s;pent &s;o agreeable a morning. To each
of the dear little Caro's pray deliver nine ki&s;&s;es for me, which &s;hall
be repaid on demand. My be&s;t compliments to Mr. Pelham, if he

<P>HAD I not given previous notice of my own unworthine&s;s, the
plea of being an old incorrigible offender would &s;erve only to
aggravate my guilt; it is &s;till &s;ufficiently black, and I can patiently
hear every reproach, except the cruel and unju&s;t imputation of hav|ing
forgotten my fair friends of the Arno and the Tyber. They
would indeed have been le&s;s pre&s;ent to my thoughts, had I main|tained
a regular <HI>weekly</HI> corre&s;pondence; &s;ince, by the effect of my
negligence, not a <HI>day</HI> has elap&s;ed without a &s;erious, though fruitle&s;s,
re&s;olution of writing by the very next po&s;t. What may have &s;ome|what
contributed, be&s;ides original &s;in, to this vile procra&s;tination, is
the cour&s;e of events that has filled this abominable winter. As long
as the poor King's fate was on &s;u&s;pen&s;e, one waited from po&s;t to po&s;t,
<PB N="700" REF="721">
between hope and fear, and when the blow was &s;truck, even Shake|&s;peare's
language was inadequate to expre&s;s our grief and indigna|tion.
I have never approved the execution of Charles the Fir&s;t; yet
Charles had invaded, in many re&s;pects, the ancient con&s;titution of
England, and the que&s;tion had been judged in the field of Na&s;eby
before it was tried in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. But Louis had given and
&s;uffered every thing. The cruelty of the French was aggravated by
ingratitude, and a life of innocence was crowned by the death of a
&s;aint, or, what is far better, of a virtuous prince, who de&s;erves our
pity and e&s;teem. He might have lived and reigned, had he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
as much active courage as he was endowed with patient forti|tude.
When I read the accounts from home, of the univer&s;al grief
and indignation which that fatal event excited, I indeed gloried in
the character of an Engli&s;hman. Our national fame is now pure
and &s;plendid; we have nobly &s;tood forth in the common cau&s;e of
mankind; and although our armaments are &s;omewhat &s;low, I &s;till
per&s;uade my&s;elf that we &s;hall give the la&s;t deadly wound to the Gallic
hydra. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia is likewi&s;e &s;low, and your poor friend,
the Duke of Brun&s;wick, is now not cen&s;ured but forgotten. We
turn our eyes to the Prince of Cobourg and his Au&s;trians, and it
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the deliverance of Holland and Brabant from
&s;uch a dragon as Dumourier is a very tolerable employment for the
month of March. The&s;e blo&s;&s;oms of the &s;pring will be followed,
it may be fairly hoped, by the fruits of &s;ummer; and in the mean|while
the troubles of Paris, and the revolt of the provinces, may
promote, by the increa&s;e of anarchy, the re&s;toration of order. I
&s;ee that re&s;toration through a dark cloud; but if France be lo&s;t, the
re&s;t of Europe, I believe and tru&s;t, will be &s;aved. But amid&s;t the
hurricane, I dare not fix my eyes on the <HI>Temple.</HI> So much for po|litics,
which now engro&s;s the waking and &s;leeping thoughts of every
feeling and thinking animal. In this country we are tranquil, and I
believe &s;afe, at lea&s;t for this &s;ummer; though peace has been pur|cha&s;ed
<PB N="701" REF="722">
cha&s;ed at &s;ome expence of national honour, of the old reputation of
Swi&s;s courage, we have crouched before the tiger, and &s;troked him
till he has &s;heathed his claws, and cea&s;ed for a moment to roar.
My journey to England this year mu&s;t depend on the events of the
campaign; as I am fully re&s;olved rather to remain quiet another
autumn and winter in my &s;weet habitation, than to encounter the
dangers of the &s;ea and land. I envy the plea&s;ures which you and
your companions have enjoyed at Florence and Rome; nor can I
decide which have ta&s;ted the mo&s;t perfect delight, tho&s;e to whom
&s;uch beauties were new, or tho&s;e to whom they were familiar.
A fine eye, correct judgment, and elegant &s;en&s;ibility, are requi&s;ite
to qualify the &s;tudious traveller; and the&s;e gifts have been liberally
di&s;pen&s;ed among the Ouchy caravan. But when you have been
gratified, though not &s;atiated, with the He&s;perian pro&s;pect, to what
fortunate clime will you direct your foot&s;teps? Have we any hopes
of meeting (for my journey, at all events, would be late) in the
&s;hades, or rather in the &s;un&s;hine, of Ouchy? Should Mount Cenis
be &s;till imperious, you have trampled on St. Bernard in a more ri|gorous
&s;ea&s;on; and what&s;oever may be the &s;tate of the world, the
Pays de Vaud will afford you a &s;ecure a&s;ylum, or a plea&s;ant &s;tation.
I rejoice to hear of Lady Be&s;borough's improvement. Will that
new title make any difference in the plan? Is the Duche&s;s very
impatient to revi&s;it England? Except &s;ome trifling con&s;iderations
of children, &amp;c. all countries may be indifferent to her; as &s;he is
&s;ure of being loved and admired in all. I am anxious and impatient
to learn the re&s;ult of your coun&s;els; but I feel my&s;elf unworthy of
a regular corre&s;pondence, and am not de&s;irous of heaping fre&s;h coals
of fire on my head.</P>
<P>I am happy to find that you forgive and pity my friend Necker,
again&s;t whom you all entertained &s;ome Ver&s;ailles prejudices. As his
heart has been always pure, he cannot feel remor&s;e; but as his con|duct
<PB N="702" REF="723">
has been un&s;ucce&s;sful, he is penetrated with grief and regret.
Madame de Stael has written to me from England; &s;he likes the
country, but means to fly over again in May.</P>

<HEAD>N^o CCX. Mr. GIBBON to Lord * * *.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>ROLLE, <DATE>February 23d, 1793.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO not merely congratulate your Lord&s;hip's promotion to an office
which your abilities have long de&s;erved. My &s;atisfaction does
not ari&s;e from an a&s;&s;urance of the wi&s;dom and vigour which admi|ni&s;tration
will derive from the &s;upport of &s;o re&s;pectable an ally. But
as a friend to government in general, I mo&s;t &s;incerely rejoice that
you are now armed in the common cau&s;e again&s;t the mo&s;t dangerous
fanatics that have ever invaded the peace of Europe; again&s;t the
new barbarians, who labour to confound the order and happine&s;s of
&s;ociety; and who, in the opinion of thinking men, are not le&s;s the
enemies of &s;ubjects than of kings. The hopes of the wi&s;e and
good are now fixed on the &s;ucce&s;s of England; and I am per&s;uaded
that my per&s;onal attachment to your Lord&s;hip will be amply gra|tified
by the important &s;hare which your coun&s;els will a&s;&s;ume in that
&s;ucce&s;s. I could wi&s;h that &s;ome of your former a&s;&s;ociates po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
&s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to extricate them&s;elves from the toils of
prejudice and party. But I grieve that a man, whom it is im|po&s;&s;ible
for me not to love and admire, &s;hould refu&s;e to obey the
voice of his country; and I begin to fear that the powerful genius
of Mr.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A town between Lau&s;anne and Geneva, where M. Necker then re&s;ided.</NOTE>, in&s;tead of being u&s;eful, will be adver&s;e to the public
&s;ervice. At this momentous cri&s;is we &s;hould enli&s;t our whole force
<PB N="703" REF="724">
of virtue, ability, and &s;pirit; and without any view to his private
advantage, I could wi&s;h that * * * might be properly
&s;tationed in &s;ome part of the line.</P>
<P>Mr. Necker, in who&s;e hou&s;e I am now re&s;iding on a vi&s;it of
&s;ome days, wi&s;hes me to expre&s;s the &s;entiments of e&s;teem and con|&s;ideration
which he entertains for your Lord&s;hip's character. As a
friend to the intere&s;t of mankind, he is warmly attached to the wel|fare
of Great Britain, which he has long revered as the fir&s;t, and
perhaps as the la&s;t a&s;ylum of genuine liberty. His late eloquent
work, <HI>Du pouvoir executif,</HI> which your Lord&s;hip has a&s;&s;uredly read,
is a valuable te&s;timony of his e&s;teem for our con&s;titution; and the
te&s;timony of a &s;agacious and impartial &s;tranger may have taught
&s;ome of our countrymen to value the political ble&s;&s;ings which they
have been tempted to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>I cheri&s;h a lively hope of being in England, and of paying my
re&s;pects to your Lord&s;hip before the end of the &s;ummer: but the
events of the year are &s;o uncertain, and the &s;ea and land are encom|pa&s;&s;ed
with &s;o many difficulties and dangers, that I am doubtful
whether it will be practicable for me to execute my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I am, my Lord, mo&s;t re&s;pectfully, and your Lord&s;hip will permit
me to add mo&s;t affectionately, your mo&s;t faithful humble &s;ervant.</P>
