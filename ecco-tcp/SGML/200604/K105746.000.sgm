<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT gave Occa&s;ion to the
following <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> is briefly
what follows, my learned and
worthy Friend Dr. <HI>Cheyne,</HI>
&s;ome rears ago publi&s;hed an E&s;&s;ay upon
<HI>Health and long Life,</HI> in which he
gave a Proof both of his Judgment
and Humanity. This Book was receiv'd
by the Publick, with the Re&s;pect that
was due to the Importance of its Con|tents;
it became the Subject of Con|ver&s;ation,
and produc'd even Sects in
the dietetick Philo&s;ophy. In &s;ome of
tho&s;e &s;ympo&s;iac Di&s;putations among&s;t my
Acquaintance, being appeal'd to; I
happen'd to affirm that the dietetick Part
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
of Medicine depended, as much as any
of the re&s;t, upon &s;cientifick Principles:
Being call'd upon to make good my A&s;|&s;ertion,
I compos'd the following &s;hort
Treati&s;e which is properly &s;peaking only
an E&s;&s;ay or Attempt of a <HI>Phy&s;iology
of Aliment.</HI> The mo&s;t of it was wrote
in a Situation, where I had no A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
except from Extracts out of &s;ome
imperfect Editions of the Works of the
mo&s;t learned and indu&s;trious <HI>Boerhaave,</HI>
and from a very excellent Edition of his
Chymi&s;try by Dr. <HI>Shaw,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cham|bers.</HI>
This I am oblig'd to &s;ay once
for all, to &s;ave my &s;elf the Trouble of
perpetual Quotations: The Circum&s;tan|ces
of ill Health, and Ab&s;ence from my
Books in which I compos'd it, and the
Want of Lei&s;ure &s;ince to correct it &s;uf|ficiently,
may he &s;ome Excu&s;e for the
Want of that Accuracy which the Sub|ject
de&s;erves, and which I frankly
own, I have di&s;cover'd in &s;ome Things
of &s;mall moment &s;ince the Book was
printed off. I am likewi&s;e obliged to
<PB N="v" REF="4">
make u&s;e of a very common and tri|vial
Rea&s;on for publi&s;hing it at this
Time, <HI>viz.</HI> the Approbation of &s;ome
Friends who perus'd it, and per&s;uaded
me that it might be of &s;ome U&s;e to the
Publick. I can &s;ay but little of the
Merit of the Performance, but a great
deal of that of the Subject; for &s;urely
the Choice and Mea&s;ure of the Mate|rials
of which the whole Body is com|pos'd,
and what we take daily by
Pounds, is at lea&s;t of as much Impor|tance,
as of what we take &s;eldom, and
only by Grains and Spoonfuls.</P>
<P>The Reader mu&s;t not be &s;urpriz'd to
find the mo&s;t common and ordinary
Facts taken notice of: In Subjects of
this Nature there is no room for In|vention;
many important Con&s;equences
may be drawn from the Ob&s;ervation of
the mo&s;t common Things, and analogous
Rea&s;onings from the Cau&s;es of them.</P>
<P>I believe a Reader with as much
Anatomy as a Butcher knows, and mo|derate
Skill in Mechanicks, may un|der&s;tand
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
the whole E&s;&s;ay, provided he
goes through it at Lei&s;ure, and with
Attention: To a Per&s;on &s;o qualify'd
many Ob&s;ervations concerning his own
Con&s;titution will occur, which I was
not capable of making; as for the hard
Words which I was oblig'd to u&s;e,
they are either Terms of Art, or &s;uch
as I &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of others,
that were too low, and vulgar; the
Reader will find mo&s;t of them explain'd
at the Beginning of the Book: And
I hope an Indulgence to a few, will
not be reckon'd an Indignity to the re&s;t;
and that I &s;hall not be &s;u&s;pected of
Affectation, where my principal Inten|tion
was Per&s;picuity. In Subjects of
this Kind, one is oblig'd in the &s;ame
Paragraph, to join many Particulars
together in one Propo&s;ition; becau&s;e the
Repetition of the Sub&s;tantive Verb
would be tedious and unnece&s;&s;ary. This
hinders the Stile from being &s;mooth,
but not from being per&s;picuous.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">
I have laid a Plan for treating the
other Parts of Diet, as Air, Re&s;t, and
Motion after the &s;ame Manner; but I
am oblig'd to delay the Execution of
my De&s;ign till I have more Lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>I do not pre&s;ume to in&s;truct the Gen|tlemen
of my own Profe&s;&s;ion; and if
any of them &s;hall in&s;truct me better, I
declare before-hand that I am very
willing to be convinc'd: I will not de|fend
any Mi&s;take, and at the &s;ame
time I do not think my &s;elf oblig'd to
an&s;wer every frivolous Objection.</P>

<HEAD>THE
EXPLANATION
OF SOME
CHYMICAL TERMS
U&s;ed in the following
ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>AS the following Treati&s;e is chief|ly
de&s;ign'd for Per&s;ons not bred
up in the Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy|&s;ick,
it is nece&s;&s;ary to give a
general Notion of the Mean|ing
of &s;ome Chymical Words that fre|quently
occur in it.</P>
<P>The Principles of Natural Bodies ac|cording
to the Chymi&s;ts, are Water, Earth,
Oil, Salt, Spirit, of all which every one
has &s;ome general Notion; but the Diver|&s;ity
<PB N="xxvi" REF="24">
of the Names and Qualities of Salts
and Spirits occa&s;ions &s;ome Confu&s;ion in
the Minds of &s;uch as are ignorant of Chy|mi&s;try.</P>
<P>The Chymi&s;ts define Salt from &s;ome
of its Properties, to be a Body fu&s;ible in
the Fire, congealable again by Cold into
britle Glebes or Cry&s;tals, &s;oluble in Wa|ter
&s;o as to di&s;appear, not malleable, and
having &s;omething in it which affecteth
the Organs of Ta&s;te with a Sen&s;ation of
Acrimony or Sharpne&s;s. Of Native Salts
there are,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Sea-Salt and Sal Gemmae, or
Rock-Salt which are of the &s;ame Nature.
The fir&s;t in all appearance being a Solu|tion
of the Second in the Water of the
Ocean; the&s;e two are perfect Salts, fixt,
and immutable by any Power in Animal
Bodies; for the other Salts are never
found in the Urine of any Animal that
&s;wallows them down, but Sea-Salt is al|ways
found in the Urine of every Animal
that takes it, and in no other.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Sal Nitre, or Sal Petre, which
is more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olv'd by Fire, and le&s;s
ea&s;ily by Water than any other Salt, it is
cold and affects the Tongue like a &s;alti&s;h
Ice: It &s;eems to be of a middle Nature
between Fo&s;&s;ile and Animal, being pro|ducible
from Animal Excrements inter|mix'd
with vegetable Salts.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvii" REF="25">
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Sal Ammoniac of two Sorts,
the ancient de&s;cribed by <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Dio&s;|corides</HI>
no more to be found: And the
Modern which is a Compound of Fo&s;&s;ile,
Animal and Vegetable Salt. This Salt
cools Water, it is fix'd in a gentle Fire
and &s;ublimes in a great one, its Ta&s;te is
quicker than that of common Salt re|&s;embling
that of Urine.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Borax, a Fo&s;&s;ile Salt of a
&s;weeti&s;h Ta&s;te, it promotes the Fu&s;ion of
Metals.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Alum, which tho' no pure Salt,
has mo&s;t of the Properties of Salts, being
&s;oluble in Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Salts are divided into Acid and Alka|line:
Of Acid or Sour, one has a Notion
from Ta&s;te; Sourne&s;s being one of tho&s;e
&s;imple Ideas, which one cannot more
plainly de&s;cribe. What being mix'd with
an Acid cau&s;eth an Efferve&s;cence, is call'd
an Alkali.</P>
<P>Efferve&s;cence in the Chymical Sen&s;e,
&s;ignifies an inte&s;tine Commotion, produ|ced
by mixing two Bodies together, that
lay at re&s;t before; attended &s;ometimes
with a hi&s;&s;ing Noi&s;e, Froathing, and E|bullition:
For Example, let us place in
the fir&s;t Cla&s;s, Acids as Vinegar, Juice of
Lemons, Juice of Oranges, Spirit of Ni|tre,
Spirit of Alum: In the &s;econd Cla&s;s,
other Saline Sub&s;tances obtain'd from A|nimals
<PB N="xxviii" REF="26">
and Vegetables, by Di&s;tillation,
Putrefaction, Calcination, as Spirit of
Urine, Spirit of Harts-horn, Salt of Tar|tar;
becau&s;e the Sub&s;tances of the &s;econd
Cla&s;s, being mix'd with the Sub&s;tances of
the fir&s;t rai&s;e an Efferve&s;cence, they are
call'd Alkalis. There is a third Cla&s;s of
Sub&s;tances, commonly call'd Ab&s;orbents,
as the various Kinds of Shels, Coral,
Chalk, Crabs-eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which being
mix'd with the fir&s;t Cla&s;s, likewi&s;e rai&s;e
an Efferve&s;cence, and are therefore call'd
Alkalis, tho' not &s;o properly; for they
are not Salts and have nothing common
with the &s;econd Cla&s;s, except this Quality
of fermenting with Acids.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that a violent Cold, as
well as Heat may be produced by this
Ebullition; for if Sal Ammoniac, or any
pure volatile Alkali di&s;&s;olv'd in Water be
mix'd with an Acid; an Ebullition with
a great Degree of Cold will en&s;ue, there|fore,
I think (with leave of the Chy|mi&s;ts)
Efferve&s;cence not &s;o proper a Word
to expre&s;s this inte&s;tine Motion. There
is another Criterion of Acid and Alkali
by the Change of Colour which they pro|duce
in &s;ome Bodies; for Example, tho&s;e
Liquors, which being pour'd to the Syrup
of Violets turn it red, are Acids; tho&s;e
which change it into a green Colour, are
reckon'd Alkalis. Thus Oil of Vitriol
<PB N="xxix" REF="27">
Syrup of Violets red, and Oil of
Tartar green.</P>
<P>The Word Alkali, comes from an Herb
call'd by the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> Kali. This Herb
they burnt to A&s;hes, boil'd them in Wa|ter;
and after having evaporated the Wa|ter,
there remain'd at the bottom a white
Salt, this they call'd Sal Kali, or Alkali.
It is corro&s;ive, producing Putrefaction in
Animal Sub&s;tances, to which it is ap|ply'd.</P>
<P>Sub&s;tances which are not perfectly A|cid
but naturally turn &s;o, I call Ace&s;cent.
Sub&s;tances which are not perfectly Alka|line
but naturally turn &s;o, I call Alka|le&s;cent.</P>
<P>The&s;e are not Qualities in Bodies mere|ly
imaginary, but have very different and
contrary Effects upon Human Bodies.</P>
<P>Salts which are neither Acid nor Al|kaline,
are call'd Neutral, &s;o are Sal Am|moniac,
Sea-Salt, Sal Gemmae, Borax,
Alum, Nitre, which as long as they re|tain
their Saline Quality, are neither A|cid
nor Alkaline. But the Chymical Pro|ducts
of them all (except Sal Ammoniac)
are generally Acid.</P>
<P>Fix'd Salts are &s;uch as &s;u&s;tain the Fire
without flying away.</P>
<P>Volatile Salts fly away with a &s;mall
Heat, affecting the No&s;e with an urinous
Smell.</P>
<P><PB N="xxx" REF="28">
There are volatile and fix'd Alkalis.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ential Salts of Plants are &s;uch
as &s;hoot upon the Sides of the Ve&s;&s;els,
which contain their expre&s;s'd Juices.</P>
<P>In Di&s;tillations what trickles down the
Sides of the Receiver in certain unctious
Rivulets, if it will not mix with Water,
it is call'd Oil, if it will mix with Wa|ter,
it is call'd Spirits; Spirits are either
inflammable, or not inflammable. The la&s;t
either Acid or Alkaline. Alkaline Spi|rits,
are &s;ubtile volatile Liquors, that run
in Veins down the Sides of the Receiver
in Di&s;tillations, which will not take Fire,
mix with Water, and contain &s;ome Al|kaline
Salt, as Spirit of Harts-horn. Such
are obtain'd from all the Parts of Ani|mals,
from all Plants by Putrefaction, and
from the pungent Kind, as Mu&s;tard,
Hor&s;e-Radi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without it. Acid Spi|rits
are &s;ubtile Liquors which come over
in Di&s;tillations, not inflammable, mi&s;cible
with Water, &s;uch are obtain'd from Ve|getables
di&s;till'd with Water, and like|wi&s;e
from Fo&s;&s;ils; inflammable Spirits are
&s;ubtile volatile Liquors which come over
in Di&s;tillations, mi&s;cible with Water, and
wholly combu&s;tible; &s;uch Spirits are ob|tainable
from Plants by a previous Fer|mentation,
and not without it. By the
Spirit of a Plant or that of an Animal,
we under&s;tand that pure elaborated Oil,
<PB N="xxxi" REF="29">
which by rea&s;on of its extreme Volatility
exhales &s;pontaneou&s;ly, in which the Odour
or Smell con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Soap is a Mixture of a fix'd Alkaline
Salt and Oil, in common U&s;e its Virtues
are clean&s;ing, penetrating, attenuating and
re&s;olving. Any Mixture of any oily Sub|&s;tance
with Salt may be call'd a Soap.</P>
<P>Bodies of this Nature are call'd Sapo|naceous.</P>
<P>He who would skilfully treat of the
Nature and Choice of different Sorts of
Aliment, ought to draw his Ob&s;ervations
from the following Particulars. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
From the Alterations which the Aliment
undergoes in its Pa&s;&s;age into the Blood.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> From the Alteration it under|goes
during its Circulation with the
Blood. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> From the Nature and
mo&s;t &s;imple Analy&s;is of Vegetable Sub|&s;tances.
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> From the Nature and
mo&s;t &s;imple Analy&s;is of Animal Sub&s;tan|ces.
<HI>Fifthly,</HI> He ought to treat of the
Effects of different Sorts of Alimentary
Sub&s;tanees upon the Fluids and Solids of
a Human Body. <HI>Sixthly,</HI> Of the diffe|rent
Intentions to be pur&s;ued in the
Choice of Aliment in different Con&s;titu|tions.
Tho' I have neither Time, Abi|lity,
nor Ob&s;ervations &s;ufficient to handle
tho&s;e Particulars &s;o fully as they de&s;erve,
<PB N="xxxii" REF="30">
I hope at lea&s;t to give a Specimen how
they ought to be treated.</P>
<P>This is agreeable to the Doctrine of
<HI>Hippocrates,</HI> who tells you in his fir&s;t
Book of Diet, that to write duly upon it,
one mu&s;t under&s;tand the Nature of Ali|ment,
and of the Per&s;on it is given to.</P>
<P>For the Ea&s;e of the Reader, I have &s;et
down every thing in di&s;tinct Propo&s;itions

<HEAD>PROP. I.</HEAD>
<P>MASTICATION is a very
nece&s;&s;ary Preparation of &s;olid
Aliment, without which there can
be no good Dige&s;tion. By chewing,
&s;olid Aliment is divided into &s;mall
<PB N="2" REF="32">
Parts; in a human Body, there is no
other In&s;trument to perform this
Action, but the Teeth. By the Action
of chewing, the Spittle and Mucus is
&s;queez'd from the Glands, and mix'd
with the Aliment, which Action if
it be long continued, will turn the
Aliment into a &s;ort of Chyle. The
Spittle is an active Liquor, immedi|ately
deriv'd from the arterial Blood.
It is &s;aponaceous, as appears by its
froathing, and likewi&s;e by di&s;tilla|tion,
and con&s;equently is attenuating,
re&s;olving, penetrating, and deter|ging.
After long Ab&s;tinence, it is ex|tremely
acrid, and copious, it fer|ments
with the juices of Vegetables,
and con&s;equently di&s;po&s;eth them to
be chang'd into inflamable Spirits,
it di&s;covereth its Virtues in &s;everal
Chirurgical u&s;es. Be&s;ides, in the action
of chewing, the Mucus (which is an
Humour different from the Spittle,
and by its Vi&s;cidity collects Air) mix|eth
with the Aliment, and helps to
<PB N="3" REF="33">
attenuate it. The nece&s;&s;ity of Saliva
or Spittle to di&s;&s;olve the Aliment, ap|pears
from the contrivance of Na|ture
in making the &s;alivary Ducts of
Animals, which ruminate or chew the
Cud, extremely open. Such Animals
as &s;wallow their Aliment without
chewing, want &s;alivary Glands; and
Birds have them placed in their Maw.
There are in&s;tances of Men who
&s;wallow'd their Meat whole, but
Ruminated or chew'd the Cud after|wards.
(Rumination is given to A|nimals
to enable them at once to lay
up a great &s;tore of Food and after|wards
to chew it.) And Animals ru|minate
more upon Hay than Gra&s;s,
the Food being harder. From all
which Ob&s;ervations it appears, that
the Solution of the Aliment by Ma|&s;tication
is very nece&s;&s;ary; and that
without it the Aliment could not be
duly di&s;po&s;ed; for the other changes
which it receives as it pa&s;&s;eth through
the Alimentary duct.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="34">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A great lo&s;s of Spittle cau&s;eth
a decay of Appetite. This has been
confirm'd by Experience in &s;everal,
who have made it their con&s;tant cu|&s;tom
to chew Ma&s;tick; chewing and
&s;moaking of Tobacco is only good
in phlegmatick People.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The humour of Saliva|tion
is not properly Spittle, but pu|trified
Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The depravation of the
In&s;truments of Ma&s;tication, by a
paralytical di&s;po&s;ition, or by the want
of Teeth, as in old Men and Infants,
is a natural Indication of a liquid
Dyet, as of Milk and Broaths, and
even &s;uch of them as take Solids
ought to chew in order to make an
expre&s;&s;ion of the Spittle.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. II.</HEAD>
<P>The Change which is made of the
Aliment in the Stomach, is effected
by Attrition of the &s;olid Parts, or
inward Coat of the Stomach, and
<PB N="5" REF="35">
the action of a di&s;&s;olvent Liquor
a&s;&s;i&s;ted with Heat.</P>
<P>The Liquor in the Stomach con|&s;i&s;ts
of that which is &s;eparated from
its inward Coat; of the Spittle,
which is almo&s;t continually &s;wal|low'd,
and the Liquor which di&s;tills
from the Gullet. By the help of this
Liquor, and the con&s;tant Attrition
of the &s;olid Parts, the Aliment is
di&s;&s;olv'd by an Operation re&s;embling
that of making an Emul&s;ion, in
which Operation the Oyly parts of
Nutts and Seeds being gently ground
in a Marble Mortar, and gradually
mix'd with &s;ome watery Liquor, are
di&s;&s;olv'd into a &s;weet, thick, turbid
milky Liquor, re&s;embling the Chyle
in an Animal Body. That the Sto|mach
in Animals levigates the Sub|&s;tances,
which it receives, is evident
from the Di&s;&s;ection of &s;ome Animals
which have &s;wallow'd Metals,
which have been found poli&s;h'd on
the &s;ide next the Stomach. Birds being
<PB N="6" REF="36">
without Teeth to make the fir&s;t
preparation of their Aliment, have
&s;trong and nervous Stomachs, to
make this Attrition the &s;tronger;
and this motion in them hath been
both &s;een and heard. The Rugae or
Plyes of the inward Coat of the
Stomach contribute to the detain|ing
the Aliment in the Stomach.
The Heat in Land Animals helps
likewi&s;e to the Solution of the Ali|ment,
but not much, for Fi&s;hes
have a &s;trong dige&s;tion without it,
tho' by the tryal of the Thermo|&s;cope,
they have more heat than the
Element which they &s;wim in. It has
been &s;how'd before that the Spittle
is a great Di&s;&s;olvent, and there is a
great quantity of it in the Stomach,
being &s;wallow'd con&s;tantly, at lea&s;t
in Sleep. He who eats a Pound of
Bread &s;wallows at lea&s;t as much Spit|tle
as Bread. This Liquor of the
Stomach in a &s;ound &s;tate is not Acid,
for it has been found by Experiments,
<PB N="7" REF="37">
that Pearls have pa&s;s'd through Cocks
and Hens undi&s;&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>1. The Liquor of the Stomach,
which with fa&s;ting grows extremely
Acrid, and the quick &s;en&s;ation of the
inward villous Coat of the Stomach,
&s;eem to be the cau&s;e of the Sen&s;e of
Hunger.</P>
<P>2. Such as have, by the u&s;e of
&s;pirituous Liquors, weaken'd and de|&s;troy'd
&s;ome of the &s;olid parts of the
Stomach, cannot recover a right
Dige&s;tion, for this inward villous Coat
when de&s;troy'd cannot be re&s;tor'd.</P>
<P>3. This Liquor of the Stomach
may (by rea&s;on of &s;ome &s;aline Acri|mony)
be made of &s;ome determined
quality, and affect human Creatures
with Appetites of other Animals,
which in that ca&s;e they can take
without hurt; or it may likewi&s;e
occa&s;ion an exorbitant Appetite of
u&s;ual things, which they will take in
&s;uch quantities till they vomit it up
like Dogs, from whence it is call'd
<PB N="8" REF="38">
Canine; in the fir&s;t ca&s;e the Organs
of Ta&s;te are vitiated; both Di&s;ea&s;es
are cur'd by Dyet, oppo&s;ite to this
Acrimony, whether Alkaline, Acid or
Muriatick.</P>
<P>4. Thir&s;t and Hunger denote the
&s;tate of the Spittle, and Liquor of
the Stomach. Thir&s;t is the &s;ign of
an Acrimony commonly Alkale&s;|cent
or Muriatick.</P>
<P>5. A Paralytical di&s;po&s;ition of the
Nerves of the Stomach, a deprav'd
condition of the Liquor of the Sto|mach,
&s;omething vi&s;cous, fat and
oyly remaining there, de&s;troys the
Sen&s;ation of Hunger.</P>
<P>6. The Action of the Stomach is
totally &s;top'd by too great Repleti|on,
in which ca&s;e both the Orifices
of the Stomach by a nece&s;&s;ary Me|chani&s;m
clo&s;e, and neither will ad|mit
nor expel any thing. In which
ca&s;e relaxing, as by warm Water, is
the only proper Expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="39">
The Signs of the Functions of the
Stomach being deprav'd, are Pains
in the Stomach many Hours after
Repa&s;t; Eructations either with the
Ta&s;te of the Aliment Acid, Nido|ro&s;e,
or Foetid, re&s;embling the Ta&s;te
of rotten Eggs; Inflations, or the Sen|&s;ation
of Fulne&s;s; Sickne&s;s, Hickup,
Vomiting, a Flu&s;hing in the Coun|tenance,
Foulne&s;s of the Tongue. In
general, whatever be the State of the
Tongue, the &s;ame is that of the in|ward
Coat of the Stomach. When
the Ta&s;te of the Mouth is bitter, it
is a Sign of a Redundance of a bi|lious

<P>By Dige&s;tion in the Alimentary
Duct the &s;pecifick Difference of all
Sub&s;tances is aboli&s;h'd, and the whole
Action re&s;embles Putrefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="40">
Dige&s;tion is a Fermentation be|gun,
becau&s;e there is all the Requi|&s;ites
of &s;uch a Fermentation, Heat,
Air and Motion, but it is not a
compleat Fermentation, becau&s;e that
requires a greater Time than the Con|tinuance
of the Aliment in the Sto|mach.
Vegetable Putrefaction re&s;em|bles
very much Animal Dige&s;tion.
Vegetable Putrefaction is produced
by throwing Green &s;ucculent Vege|tables
in a Heap in open warm Air,
and pre&s;&s;ing them together, by which
all Vegetables acquire, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Heat
equal to that of a Human Body.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> A putrid &s;tercoraceous Ta&s;te
and Odour, in Ta&s;te re&s;embling pu|trid
Fle&s;h, and in Smell Human Foe|ces.
This putrid Matter being di|&s;till'd,
affords, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Water im|pregnated
with an urinous Spirit,
like that obtainable from Animal
Sub&s;tances, which Water is &s;eperable
into Elementary Water, and a vola|tile
Animal Salt. <HI>Secondly,</HI> A vola|tile
<PB N="11" REF="41">
oyly Alkaline Salt. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> A
volatile thick Oyl. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> The
remainder being calcin'd affords no
fixt Salt; in &s;hort, every thing hap|pens
as if the Subject had not been
Vegetable, but Animal. Putrefaction
utterly de&s;troys the &s;pecifick Diffe|rence
of one Vegetable from ano|ther,
converting them into a pulpy
Sub&s;tance of an Animal Nature:
Making the &s;ame Alteration very
near as if the Vegetable had gone
through the Body of a &s;ound Ani|mal,
for tho' &s;uch an Animal &s;hould
entirely live upon Acids, no Part of
its Body affords any acid fix'd Salt.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</NOTE> This is &s;o far true, that even the
Herbs taken out of the <HI>Oma&s;us</HI> of

tho' this Action of Putrefaction comes

&s;o far differs from it, that the Salts
<PB N="12" REF="42">

Animal Body &s;o long as they remain
benign and friendly to it; but as

<P>The Gall is the principal Di&s;&s;ol|vent
of the Aliment, and when it is
peccant or deficient, there can be no
right Dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>The Bile is of two Sorts, the Cy|&s;tick
or that contain'd in the Gall|Bladder,
which is a &s;ort of Repo&s;itory
for the Gall, and the Hepatick or what
flows immediately from the Liver. The
Cy&s;tick Gall is thick and inten&s;ly bit|ter,
&s;o that one Drop of it will make a
whole Pint of Water bitter. The He|patick
Gall is more fluid and not &s;o
bitter. There is no other bitter Hu|mour
in a Human Body, be&s;ides
Gall, except the Wax of the Ear.
<PB N="13" REF="43">
The Gall is not a perfect Alkali, for
it does not ferment with an Acid,
but it is Alkale&s;cent, entirely oppo|&s;ite
to Ace&s;cents, and &s;oon corrupti|ble,
and convertible into a Corro&s;ive
Alkali. It is a &s;aponaceous Sub|&s;tance,
being compos'd of an Alka|line
Salt, Oyl and Water, all which
can be extracted from it. The Bile,
like Soap, takes out Spots from Wool
or Silk, and the Painters u&s;e it to
mix their Colours; by this &s;apona|ceous
Quality, it mixeth the oyly
and watery Parts of the Aliment to|gether.
But tho' the Bile be an Oyl,
it is not combu&s;tible till dry. The&s;e
Qualities make it a mo&s;t powerful
and proper Di&s;&s;olvent, which ap|pears
by Experience. The Milk in
the Stomach of Calves, which is co|agulated
by the Runnet, is again di&s;|&s;olv'd,
and rendered fluid by the Gall
in the <HI>Duodenum.</HI> Voracious Ani|mals,
and &s;uch as do not chew, have
a great Quantity of Gall, and &s;ome
<PB N="14" REF="44">
of them have the Biliary Duct in|&s;erted

the chief In&s;trument (by its Ir|ritation)
of the peri&s;taltick Motion of

peccant or deficient are reliev'd by
Bitters, which are a &s;ort of &s;ub&s;idia|ry
Gall. The learned <HI>Boorhaave</HI> has

mo&s;t inten&s;ely bitter, a mo&s;t effectual
Remedy in &s;uch Ca&s;es. The com|mon

the Chyle pa&s;&s;eth through the Me|&s;entery,
it is mix'd with the Lymph

more perfect; be&s;ides, none of the&s;e

are mix'd with the Foeces of
an Animal, which in a &s;ound State
are hard. So that one may com|pute
that a Pound of Bread before

<PB N="20" REF="50">
with four times the quantity of Ani|mal

is ob&s;erv'd in the Circulation of the

intimately with the Parts of the Fluid
to which it is to be a&s;&s;imilated.</P>
<P>1. From whence it follows, that
an Animal who&s;e Juices are un&s;ound
or &s;olid Parts weak can never be duly
nouri&s;h'd, for un&s;ound Juices can never
duly repair the Fluids and Solids of
an Animal Body, and without a due

be&s;ides, the Chyle is not &s;uck'd

of the Guts: The Mouths of the
Lacteals are open'd by the inte&s;tinal
Tube, affecting a &s;treight in&s;tead of
a &s;piral Cylinder. Thus it is plain,
that the Chyle mu&s;t be peccant in
Quantity or Quality when the&s;e Acti|ons

whatever &s;trengthens the &s;olid Parts

<P>2. Diarhaeas and &s;trong Purgati|ons
mu&s;t &s;poil the fir&s;t Dige&s;tion,
becau&s;e of the great Quantities of
Animal Liquids which they expel
out of the Body; a va&s;t Quantity and
Variety of Animal Liquors are car|ried
off by Purging, Air, Spittle,
<HI>Mucus,</HI> all the Liquors that are &s;epa|rated
in the Glands of the Alimenta|ry
Duct, both Sorts of Bile, the pan|creatick
Juice, Lymph, and &s;ometimes
Blood; computing the Quantity of
the&s;e Secretions, makes it plain that
the whole Juices may be carried off
by purging, and when tho&s;e Liquors
are expell'd out of the Body, which
by their Mixture convert the Ali|ment
into an Animal Liquid, this
cannot &s;o well be perform'd.</P>
<P>3. The peri&s;taltick Motion of the

to &s;ub&s;ide at the Expul&s;ion of it.
The Pulmonary Artery and Vein pa&s;s
along the &s;urfaces of the&s;e Air-Blad|ders
in an infinite number of Rami|fications.
A great number of tho&s;e
Air-Bladders form what we call Lo|buli,
which hang upon the Bronchia,
like bunches of Grapes upon a Stalk.
The&s;e Lobuli con&s;titute the Lobes,
and the Lobes the Lungs. Let us &s;ee
what effect an Engine &s;o contriv'd
will have upon the crude mixture of
Blood and Chyle; fir&s;t, as the Blood

they will be &s;till more perfectly mix'd,
a red Liquor, and a white Liquor
pa&s;&s;ing through only one Tube, will
both retain their Original Colours;
but if this Pipe is divided into
Branches, and the&s;e again &s;ubdivided,
the red and white Liquors, as they
pa&s;s through the Ramifications, will
be more intimately mix'd, and both
Colours will be blended together;
<PB N="28" REF="58">
the more Ramifications, the mixture
will be the more perfect; but this
is not all, for as this mixture of
Blood and Chyle pa&s;&s;eth through the

contrary forces, that of the Heart
driving it forward again&s;t the &s;ides

of the Air pre&s;&s;ing it on the oppo&s;ite

this Arterial Tube creeps. By tho&s;e
two oppo&s;ite forces, the parts of the

who&s;e &s;urfaces are by turns freed

1. The force of the Air upon the
Pulmonary Artery is but &s;mall, in
re&s;pect of that of the Heart, but it
is &s;till &s;omething, and whatever the
effect of it be, it encrea&s;eth, and di|mini&s;heth
with the Gravity of the
Air, to which the Ela&s;ticity is pro|portional.</P>
<P>As to the admittance of the
weighty and ela&s;tick parts of the Air
into the Blood, through the Coats

Experience. The &s;pumous and florid
&s;tate which the Blood acquires in

accounted for, from its own Ela&s;ti|city,
and the violent motion before
de&s;crib'd: The Aerial Particles in the
Blood and Chyle expanding them|&s;elves.
That the air in the Blood
Ve&s;&s;els has a communication with
the outward Air, I think &s;eems plain
from the Experiments of Human
Creatures being able to bear Air of
much greater Den&s;ity in diving, and of

much le&s;s upon the tops of Moun|tains,
provided the Changes be made
gradually; otherwi&s;e the Air within
the Ve&s;&s;els being of a le&s;s Den&s;ity,
the outward Air would pre&s;s their
&s;ides together, and being of a greater
Den&s;ity, would expand them &s;o as

<P>1. As much Blood pa&s;&s;eth through
the Lungs, as through all the re&s;t of
the Body. The Circulation is quicker
and Heat greater, and their Texture
is extremely delicate; upon all which
Accounts they are extremely &s;en&s;ible
of any Force either from the too vio|lent
Motion or Acrimony of the

<P>2. Since the Lungs are the fir&s;t

the Animal that has that Or|gan
faulty, can never be duly nou|ri&s;h'd,
nor have the Vital Juices,

<P>The Fluids and Solids of an Animal
Body demand a con&s;tant Reparation.</P>
<P>An Animal in order to be
moveable mu&s;t be flexible, and there|fore
is fitly made of &s;eparate and
&s;mall &s;olid Parts replete with proper
Fluids. The whole Body is nothing
but a Sy&s;tem of &s;uch Canals, which
all communicate with one another,
mediately or immediately (for a Lym|phatick
Ve&s;&s;el communicates with
the Artery, by the intermediate
Gland.) In this moveable Body the
fluid and &s;olid Parts, mu&s;t be con|&s;um'd
by the Mu&s;cular Motion, and
the perpetual Flux of the Liquids;
<PB N="39" REF="69">
a great part of which are thrown
out of the Body by proper Emi&s;&s;a|ries,
and the &s;maller Solids are like|wi&s;e
rubb'd off, mix'd with the
Fluids, and in that form exhal'd.
Therefore both Fluids and Solids de|mand
a con&s;tant Reparation.</P>
<P>1. The Quantity of Solids not
Morbid in an Animal Body is very
&s;mall, as appears by Atrophies, or
Decays; and likewi&s;e by Micro&s;copes,
tho&s;e Solids are entirely Nervous
and proceed from the Brain, and
Spinal Marrow, which by their bulk
appear &s;ufficient to furni&s;h all the
Stamina or Threads of the &s;olid
Parts. The Solids are originally form'd
of a Fluid, from a &s;mall Point, as
appears by the gradual Formation
of a Foetus. The Solids and Fluids
differ, only in the degree of Cohe|&s;ion,
which being a little encreas'd
turns a Fluid into a Solid. How
the Fluids are repair'd has been
already explain'd. The Nutrition
<PB N="40" REF="70">
of the Solids is &s;omewhat more ob|&s;cure.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>Nutrition of the Solids is per|form'd
by the circulating Liquid in

<P>The Fluids and Solids of an Ani|mal

into one another. The white of an
Egg (a Fluid re&s;embling the Serum
of the Blood, and of which a whole
Animal is made) will coagulate and
turn Solid by a moderate Heat, and
the harde&s;t of Animal Solids are re|&s;olvable
again into Gellys.</P>
<P>As the white of an Egg by Incu|bation,
&s;o can the Serum by the
action of the Fibres be &s;till more
and more attenuated. A Fluid
moving through a flexible Canal,
when the Canal grows extremely
&s;mall and &s;lender, by its Friction,
<PB N="41" REF="71">
will naturally lengthen, and as it
were Wire-draw, the Sides of the
Canal, according to the Direction
of its Axis, and as the Canal is leng|then'd
or Wire-drawn, it grows &s;till
&s;maller and &s;lenderer &s;o as that the

the Extremities of the&s;e &s;mall

off with the Fluid continually, and
likewi&s;e continually repair'd and new
ones made in their room. The Force
of the Fluid will likewi&s;e &s;eparate the
&s;malle&s;t Particles which compo&s;e the
Fibres &s;o as to leave vacant Inter&s;ti|ces
in tho&s;e Places where they co|her'd

will be again fill'd up by Particles
carried on by the &s;ucceeding Fluid
(as a Bank by the Mud of the Cur|rent)
and which of cour&s;e mu&s;t be
reduced to that Figure which gives
the lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance to the Current,
and con&s;equently mu&s;t apply them|&s;elves
to the inward Surface of the
<PB N="42" REF="72">

Sy&s;tem of Tubes that is the Animal
entire.</P>
<P>1. Tho&s;e Tubes that are mo&s;t re|cently
made of Fluids are mo&s;t fle|xible
and mo&s;t ea&s;ily lengthen'd, &s;uch
Tubes as have often &s;uffer'd this Force
grow rigid, and hardly more extendi|ble
therefore.</P>
<P>2. An Animal the nearer to its
Original, the more it grows.</P>
<P>3. To this Motion of Elongation
of the Fibres is owing the Union
or Conglutination of the Parts of the
Body, when they are &s;eparated by a
Wound.</P>
<P>4. From the foregoing Doctrine
it is ea&s;y to explain the Formation
of the mo&s;t &s;olid Parts of the Body,
for when the Fluid moves in &s;everal
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, which by the Contact
of their Sides &s;top the Current of
the Fluid tho&s;e Canals by degrees
are aboli&s;h'd and grow &s;olid, &s;everal
of them united grow a Membrane,
<PB N="43" REF="73">
the&s;e Membranes further con&s;olidated
become Cartilages, and Cartilages,
Bones; con&s;equently, an Animal the
nearer it is to its Original, the more
Pipes it hath, and as it advanceth in
Age &s;till the fewer. Many of our
Ve&s;&s;els degenerate into Ligaments the
very Sutures of the Skull are aboli&s;h'd
in old Age.</P>
<P>5. Many practical Rules may be
drawn from the foregoing Doctrine,
for the Diet of Human Creatures
according to their different States of
Life, and the Condition of the So|lids,
it is evident that the Diet of
Infants ought to be extremely thin,
&s;uch as lengthens the Fibres without
Rupture; but in a young Animal,
when the Solids are too Lax (the
Ca&s;e of rickety Children) the Diet
ought to be gently A&s;tringent.</P>
<P>The Aliment likewi&s;e ought to be
different according to the State of
the Solids, in Animals full grown:
tho' an Animal arrives at its full
<PB N="44" REF="74">
Growth at a certain Age, perhaps it
never comes to its full Bulk, till the
la&s;t Period of Life. The <HI>Membra|na
adipo&s;a</HI> inve&s;ts almo&s;t every Part
of the Body, &s;o that there is hard|ly
any Fibre, but is &s;heath'd with a
Part of it. This Membrane &s;epa|rates
an oily Liquor call'd Fat, ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for many Purpo&s;es of Life;
when the Fibres are Lax, and the
Aliment too redundant, great part
of it is converted into this oily Li|quor,
all the &s;uperfluous Weight of
an Animal beyond the Ve&s;&s;els, Bones
and Mu&s;cles is nothing but Fat; but
the Conver&s;ion of the Aliment into
Fat is not properly Nutrition, which
is a Reparation of the Solids and
Fluids, and Fat properly &s;peaking is
neither. But I &s;hall treat more par|ticularly
of the&s;e Subjects in their
proper Place.</P>
<P>7. The Matter of Nutrition is
mo&s;t &s;ubtile, and Nutrition the la&s;t
and mo&s;t perfect Animal Action, to

perform it by the foregoing Propo|&s;itions,
there mu&s;t be a due Degree
of projectile Motion, or Celerity of
Circulation to which Attrition and
Heat is proportional. The Heat e|qual
to Incubation, is only nutri|tious;
any thing le&s;s or more is in|&s;ufficient,
and the nutritious Juice it|&s;elf
re&s;embles the White of an Egg,
in all its Qualities. By too weak a
Circulation the Aliment approacheth
to the&s;e Qualities which it would ac|quire

Barley is Emollient, moi&s;tning

<P>The Operations of Cookery

no Chymi&s;t can make Milk or Blood

Vegetables re&s;olve them&s;elves by &s;uch
Simple Operations, as barely &s;epa|rate
their Parts without confounding
or de&s;troying them.</P>
<P>The two Operations already men|tion'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> making an Emul&s;ion
and Vegetable Putrefaction re&s;emble
Animal Dige&s;tion the mo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="94">
1. In making an Emul&s;ion, the
oily Parts of Vegetables di&s;&s;olve in|to
a white Liquor, re&s;embling Chyle.
Our Vegetable Food con&s;i&s;ts of mealy
Seeds, Fruits, Bread, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon which
the Teeth and Jaws act as the Pe&s;tle
and Mortar, the Spittle, Bile, Pancrea|tick

in&s;tead of the Water, which
the Chymi&s;t employs, the Stomach
and Inte&s;tines are the Pre&s;s, and the
Lacteal Ve&s;&s;els the Strainers, to &s;e|parate
the pure Emul&s;ion from its
Foeces. The Chyle is white, as con|&s;i&s;ting
of Salt, Oil, and Water of
our Food, much levigated or &s;mooth.
This likewi&s;e con&s;titutes the white|ne&s;s
of Emul&s;ions.</P>
<P>2. Vegetable Putrefaction (by
what has been mention'd before)
turns Vegetable Sub&s;tances into an
Animal Nature.</P>
<P>3. Among&s;t the Ingredients of
Vegetables that which con&s;titutes the
mo&s;t &s;piritous and fragrant part of
<PB N="65" REF="95">
the Plant, is what pa&s;&s;eth by Per|&s;piration,
and exhales by the action
of the Sun. This is as it were the
pre&s;iding Spirit of the Plant, from
which it draws its peculiar flavour,
and is the mo&s;t active Principle in
the Vegetable. Thus every Plant has
its Atmo&s;phere, which have very
various effects on the&s;e who &s;tay
near them, producing Head Achs,
Sleep, Fainting, Vapours; and o|thers,
a great refre&s;hment of the Spi|rits.
It is reported, that in <HI>Brazil</HI>
there are Trees which kill tho&s;e that
&s;it under their &s;hade in a few Hours.
This fragrant Spirit is obtain'd from
all Plants which are in the lea&s;t Aro|matick,
by a cold Still, with a heat
not exceeding that of Summer.</P>
<P>4. If to a Plant you pour hot Wa|ter,
and let it &s;tand a &s;ufficient time,
the Liquor &s;train'd is call'd the infu|&s;ion
of the Plant, if the Plant be boil'd
in the &s;ame Water, the &s;train'd Li|quor
is call'd the Decoction of the
<PB N="66" REF="96">
Plant. The Infu&s;ions and Decoctions
of Plants contain the mo&s;t &s;eparable
parts of the Plants, and convey not
only their Nutritious but Medicinal
Qualities into the Blood. This is
plain by many Experiments. The
Infu&s;ion of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia Fi&s;tularis</HI> makes the
Urine Green. The Infu&s;ions and De|coctions
of Rhubarb, and Saffron
will in a quarter of an Hour tinge
the Urine with a high Yellow.</P>
<P>5. The mo&s;t oily parts are not
&s;eparated by a &s;light Decoction, till
they are di&s;entangl'd from the Salts,
for if what remains of the Subject
after the Infu&s;ion and Decoction, be
continu'd to be boil'd down with
the addition of fre&s;h Water, a fat
&s;apid odorous vi&s;cous inflammable
frothy Water will con&s;tantly be found
floating a top of the boiling Liquor,
which being &s;cumm'd off and gently
dry'd, will flame away in the Fire.
This Liquor is a kind of Soap con&s;i|&s;ting
of the Oil and Salt of the Plant.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="97">
6. Infu&s;ions and &s;light De|coctions
contain more of the Speci|fick
Qualities of the Plant than the&s;e
which are more violent, for by a
&s;trong Decoction &s;ome part of the
Ta&s;te and Smell fly off every Mo|ment.</P>
<P>7. The Infu&s;ion and Decocti|on
prepar'd as before being evapo|rated
to a thicker Con&s;i&s;tence, ac|cording
to the &s;everal Degrees of
Thickne&s;s pa&s;&s;eth into a Jelly, Defru|tum,
&s;apa Rob extract which contain
all the virtues of the Infu&s;ion or De|coction
freed only from &s;ome of the
watery parts.</P>
<P>8. The utmo&s;t force of boiling
Water is not able to de&s;troy the
&s;tructure of the tendere&s;t Plant. The
Lineaments of a White Lily will re|main
after the &s;tronge&s;t Decoction.</P>
<P>9. The Extract obtain'd by the
former Operation burnt to A&s;hes,
and tho&s;e A&s;hes boil'd in Water, and
filtrated, yield a fiery Salt.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="98">
10. The greater Quantity of vo|latile
Salt any Plant contains, which
is the ca&s;e of the more pungent in
Ta&s;te, and Odour, the le&s;s it affords
of this fixt Alkali: Tho&s;e fix'd Al|kaline
Salts do not preexi&s;t in the
&s;ame form in the Plant, for Acid
Plants as Sorel will afford by this O|peration,
an Alkaline Salt. Tho&s;e
Salts grow &s;till more fiery and
Alkaline by a greater degree of Heat.
Of all the E&s;&s;ential Salts of Plants,
that which is in mo&s;t common u&s;e
in Aliment, is Sugar, which rather
di&s;&s;olves Flegm, than increa&s;eth it;
fot it grows tenacious only by long
boiling, it is a Sal Oleo&s;um, for
it is both &s;oluble in Water, and fu|&s;ible
in Fire.</P>
<P>11. Another manner of preparing
Vegetables is by expre&s;&s;ing their
Juices. Tho&s;e expre&s;s'd Juices, con|tain
the true E&s;&s;ential Salt of the
Plant, for if they be boil'd into the
con&s;i&s;tence of a Syrup, and fet in a
<PB N="69" REF="99">
cool place; the E&s;&s;ential Salt of the
Plant will &s;hoot upon the &s;ides of
the Ve&s;&s;els. Tho&s;e E&s;&s;ential Salts of
Plants differ according to the Plant
unto which they belong, but are re|duc'd
into three Cla&s;&s;es. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Tho&s;e
of Acid A&s;tringent, Au&s;tere Vege|tables
as of unripe Fruits which re|&s;emble
the Tartar. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Tho&s;e
of &s;ucculent watery Plants, as En|dive,
Cichory which afford a fine
nitrous kind of Salt &s;oluble in Wa|ter,
and very cooling. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Tho&s;e
from oily Aromatick and odorife|rous
Vegetables, which will hardly
afford any till their Oils be extract|ed
from them: feom hence it ap|pears
that the expre&s;s'd Juices of Ve|getables
not filtrated very clear con|tain
their whole Specifick Virtues.</P>
<P>12. In the preparations of Coo|kery
the mo&s;t volatile parts of Ve|getables
are de&s;troy'd; if any of them
are retain'd it is in Decoctions which
are made in Balneo.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="100">
Decoctions, when we take the Li|quor,
contain the Specifick Virtues
of the Plants, when we feed upon
the Plant it makes their &s;olid parts
more tender, and deprives them of
a great deal of their more &s;ubtile
Oils.</P>
<P>13. The va&s;cular and &s;olid parts
of Plants are incapable of any change
in the Animal Body, for the remain|der
of a &s;trong Decoction held over
a clear Fire will burn to A&s;hes,
which is true Elementary Earth.
The fibrous and &s;olid parts of Plants,
pa&s;s unalter'd through the Inte&s;tines,
and &s;ometimes by &s;ticking there oc|ca&s;ion
great di&s;orders. Grains and
Nuts pa&s;s often through Animals
unalter'd. The Excrements of Hor&s;es
are nothing but Hay, and as &s;uch

of Vegetables by Fermentation,
whereby they are wrought up into
&s;pirituous Liquors, which may be call'd

<P>AN Animal con&s;ider'd in its
material part, cannot well be
defin'd from any particular origanical
part, which in &s;ome &s;pecies are want|ing,
in others are more than one,
nor from its locomotive Faculty;
for there are &s;ome which adhere to

<PB N="72" REF="102">
of an Animal is to take
its Aliment by a voluntary action,
by &s;ome aperture of the Body,
which may be call'd a Mouth, and
to convey it into another call'd the
Inte&s;tines, into which its Roots are
implanted, whereby it draws its
Nouri&s;hment much after the manner
of Vegetables, only a Vegetable has
its Root planted without it&s;elf, and
an Animal its Root within its &s;elf.
A Foetus in the Womb is indeed
nouri&s;h'd like a Plant, but after|wards
by a Root planted within
it&s;elf, perhaps too an Animal may
be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from a Vegetable in
that its Juices move through the Ca|nals
by a projectile Motion.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. I.</HEAD>
<P>To give a &s;hort account of the con|&s;tituent
Parts of Animal Sub&s;tances.</P>
<P>An Animal con&s;i&s;ts of &s;olid and fluid
Parts, unle&s;s one &s;hould reckon &s;ome
<PB N="73" REF="103">
of an intermediate nature as Fat and
Flegm.</P>
<P>1. The &s;olids &s;&egrave;em to be Earth
bound together with &s;ome Oil, for
if a Bone be calcin'd &s;o, as the lea&s;t
force will crumble it, being im|mers'd
in Oil it will grow firm
again.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Animal Solids are Earth
in its greate&s;t Simplicity, for the
Chymi&s;ts make Ve&s;&s;els of Animal
Sub&s;tances calcin'd, which will not
vitrify in the Fire; for all Earth which
hath any Salt or Oil in it, will turn
to Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>2. The Fluids of Animals are
more crude, and re&s;emble tho&s;e of
Vegetables, as they are nearer the
Root of the Animal. Thus Chyle
may be &s;aid to be a, vegetable Juice
in the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, and
pour'd upon Blood it &s;eems like Oil;
as it pa&s;&s;eth into the Lacteals it
grows &s;till more Animal, and when
it has circulated often with the Blood,
it is entirely &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="104">
3. Blood is the mo&s;t univer&s;al
Juice in an Animal Body, and from
which all the re&s;t are deriv'd, the red
part of it differs from the Serum, the
Serum from the Lymph, the Lymph
from the nervous Juice, and that
from the &s;everal other Humours that
are &s;eparated in the Glands.</P>
<P>4. Animal Sub&s;tances differ from
Vegetable in two Things. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In
that being reduc'd to A&s;hes they are
perfectly in&s;ipid, all Animal Salts
being volatile, flying off with great
Heat. <HI>Secondly,</HI> In that there is no
&s;incere Acid in any Animal Juice.</P>
<P>5. And yet the Parts of the one
are tran&s;mutable into the nutritious
Juice of the other. An Animal can
nouri&s;h a Plant, and a Plant an Ani|mal,
by which it &s;eems probable that
Vegetables have the Power of con|verting
the alkaline Juices of Ani|mals
into Acids. From the two
foremention'd Differences of Vegeta|ble
and Animal Sub&s;tances follows,
<PB N="75" REF="105">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That all Animal Diet is alka|le&s;cent,
or anti-acid. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That
Animal Sub&s;tances containing no fixt
Salt, want the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e for
Dige&s;tion, which pre&s;erve them both
within and without the Body from
Putrefaction.</P>
<P>6. The con&s;tituent Parts of Ani|mals
are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Earth. <HI>Secondly,</HI> A
peculiar Spirit analogous to that of
Plants. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Water. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Salts.
<HI>Fifthly,</HI> Oil.</P>
<P>7. The Earth as was before ob|&s;erv'd
is &s;incere, and immutable.</P>
<P>8. The Spirit is an oily Sub&s;tance
&s;o attenuated as to become volatile.
This Spirit &s;eems to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd
in every Species, and Individual; a
Blood-Hound will follow the Tract
of the Per&s;on he pur&s;ues, and all
Hounds the particular Game they
have in Cha&s;e, and the Faculty by
which they di&s;tingui&s;h particular Men
&s;eems to be analogous to ours of di&s;|tingui&s;hing
the different Species of
Vegetables by their Scent.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="106">
9. Therefore, &s;ince the Animals
of the wild kind have their Scent,
and con&s;equently this pre&s;iding Spi|rit
more high, it is probable that
their Juices are more exalted in Pro|portion.</P>
<P>10. Water is the chief Ingredient
in all the Animal Fluids and Solids;
for a dry Bone di&s;till'd affords a great
quantity of in&s;ipid Water. There|fore
Water &s;eems to be proper Drink
for every &s;ort of Animal.</P>
<P>11. The Juices of Animals con|&s;i&s;t
of Water impregnated with Salts
of a peculiar Nature (excepting
Chyle which as was &s;aid before may
be reputed a vegetable Juice, and
often contain Acids) The&s;e Salts are
neither acid, nor perfectly volatile;
for in the Evaporation of Human
Blood by a gentle Fire the Salt will
not ri&s;e, but only the Spirit, and
Water, not perfectly fix'd; for Hu|man
Blood calcin'd yields no fix'd
Salt, nor is it a <HI>Sal Ammoniac;</HI> for
<PB N="77" REF="107">
that remains immutable after repeat|ed
Di&s;tillations; and Di&s;tillation de|&s;troys
the ammoniacal Quality of
Animal Salts, and turns them alka|line,
&s;o that it is a Salt neither quite
fix'd, nor quite volatile, nor quite
acid, nor quite alkaline, nor quite
ammoniacal, but &s;oft and benign,
approaching neare&s;t to the Nature of
a <HI>Sal Ammoniac.</HI> The elementary
Salts of Animals are not the &s;ame, as
they appear by Di&s;tillation; the&s;e
Alterations being made by Fire. Tho&s;e
Salts are of a peculiar benign mild
Nature in healthy Per&s;ons who have
a vital Force to &s;ubdue all the &s;apid
Sub&s;tances which they feed upon, but
in &s;uch who have not that vital Force,
or commit &s;ome Error in their Diet,
the&s;e Salts are not &s;ufficiently atte|nuated,
and retain their original Qua|lities,
which they di&s;cover in Cahe|xies,
Scurvies of &s;everal kinds and
other Di&s;tempers. The Cure of which
chiefly lies in the choice of Aliment
<PB N="78" REF="108">
with Qualities oppo&s;ite to the Na|ture
of the&s;e Salts.</P>
<P>12. Animal Oil is various accord|ing
to Principles inherent in it, but
being freed from the Earth, Salts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
it is a &s;imple unactive principle, and
the &s;ame in all Animals.</P>
<P>13. Animal Sub&s;tances are more
ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imulated into Animal Sub|&s;tances,
and therefore it &s;eems pro|bable
that they are more nouri&s;hing
to Human Bodies than Vegetable.</P>
<P>The Nature of Animal Food mu&s;t
depend upon the Nature, Age, Diet,
and other Circum&s;tances of the Ani|mal
we feed upon.</P>
<P>Animal Juices as well as Vegetable
are in their greate&s;t Perfection when
the Animal is full grown; young A|nimals
participate of the Nature of
their tender Aliment, as Sucklings of
Milk.</P>
<P>Animal Nouri&s;hment differs con|&s;iderably
as the Animal is terre&s;trial,
amphibious, or aquatick. Fi&s;hes con|tain
<PB N="79" REF="109">
more of Animal Salts and Oil,
for they corrupt &s;ooner than terre&s;|trial
Animals, &s;ome Fi&s;hes as the

<P>The mu&s;cular Fibres of Fi&s;hes are

tho&s;e of terre&s;trial Animals, and their
whole Sub&s;tance more watery. Some
Fi&s;hes as Whitings, can be almo&s;t
entirely di&s;&s;olv'd into Water.</P>
<P>From which Qualities a Diet of
Fi&s;h is more rich and alkale&s;ccnt than
that of Fle&s;h, and therefore very im|proper
for &s;uch as practi&s;e Mortifi|cation.
The Inhabitants of Sea-Port
Towns are generally prolifick.</P>
<P>The Oils with which Fi&s;hes a|bound
often turn rancid, and lie hea|vy
on the Stomach, and effect the
very Sweat with a rancid Smell, which
is found to be true in &s;ome Places
where the Inhabitants live entirely
upon Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="110">
Notwith&s;tanding the redundant
Oil in Fi&s;hes they do not increa&s;e
Fat &s;o much as Fle&s;h, by rea&s;on of
their watery Quality.</P>
<P>Water-Fowl abound with the &s;ame
rancid Oil as Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h being highly alkale&s;cent, wants
to be qualified by Salt and Vinegar.</P>
<P>14. Another Difference of the Fle&s;h
of Animals depends upon the diffe|rence
of their Food, from which it
is not hard to determine their Qua|lities
con&s;ider'd as Aliment. Tho&s;e
Animals that live upon other Ani|mals
have their Fle&s;h and Juices more
alkale&s;cent, than tho&s;e that live upon
Vegetables.</P>
<P>15. The difference of the Quali|ties
of the Fle&s;h of the &s;ame Species,
depends upon the manner of living
of the Animal.</P>
<P>Ab&s;tracting from other Con&s;ide|rations,
the mo&s;t healthy Animal
affords the be&s;t Aliment, and the
ca&s;trated; than tho&s;e that are not &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="111">
An Animal that feeds it&s;elf takes
the mo&s;t proper Food, in the pro|pere&s;t
Quantities (if it has plenty
enough) has better Air, and more
Exerci&s;e, all which contribute to
make the Animal more healthy; for
the&s;e Rea&s;ons <HI>Hippocrates</HI> commends
the Fle&s;h of the wild Sow above the
tame. The wild Kinds of Animals
having more Exerci&s;e, have their Jui|ces
more elaborated and exalted; but
for the &s;ame Rea&s;on the Fibres are
harder, e&s;pecially when old. For this
Rea&s;on perhaps the Roe-Buck is the

Rule in &s;ome mea&s;ure holds true with
Fi&s;hes; Sea-Fi&s;h living in an Ele|ment
more agitated, and River-Fi&s;h

<P>Eels for want of Exerci&s;e are fat
and &s;limy, for this Rea&s;on perhaps
Fi&s;h without Fins and Scales were for|bid

<P>As the Fibres of fat Animals are

<P>16. The Juices of the &s;ame Ani|mal
in Decoctions are often more
nouri&s;hing, when the &s;olid Parts are
not &s;o good, and the Broth made
of grown Animals more nouri&s;hing
than that of young; for of the Parts
of the &s;ame Animal the mu&s;cular
Fle&s;h with the nervous Parts, afford
the be&s;t Nouri&s;hment as containing
the mo&s;t &s;pirituous Parts. The dif|ference
of the mu&s;cular Fle&s;h taken
in Sub&s;tance depends upon the Hard|ne&s;s,
Tenderne&s;s, Moi&s;ture or Dry|ne&s;s
of the Fibres. The Glands dif|fer
according to the particular Juices
which they &s;eparate from the Blood.

immediately ari&s;e; from whence the
Propo&s;ition is evident, that Milk is
neither an Acid nor Alkali, but when
there is an Acid and Alkali mix'd in
it, they manife&s;t them&s;elves by their
Conflict: Milk doth not di&s;cover it|&s;elf

<P>2. The Milks of &s;everal Animals

Order. That of Women,
A&s;&s;es, Mares, Goats, Sheeps, Cows.
The Milk of Animals which make
hard Dung is mo&s;t nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>3. Milk &s;tanding &s;ome time, na|turally
&s;eparates into an oily Liquor,
call'd Cream, and a thinner, blue
and more ponderous Liquor, call'd
skimm'd Milk, neither of which Parts
is naturally acid or alkaline (but may
<PB N="86" REF="116">
turn &s;o by &s;tanding for &s;ome time)
nor in the lea&s;t acrimonious, for be|ing
let fall into the Eye they cau&s;e
no Pain or Sen&s;ation of Sharpne&s;s.
Milk is a kind of Emul&s;ion, or white
Animal Liquor re&s;embling Chyle pre|pared
chiefly from Vegetables, and
after it has been mix'd with the Ani|mal
Juices of the Saliva, Bile, pan|creatick
Juice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is ea&s;ily &s;eparated
from them again in the Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>4. It differs from a vegetable E|mul&s;ion
by coagulating into a curdy
Ma&s;s with Acids, which Chyle and
vegetable Emul&s;ions will not: Acids
mix'd with them precipitate a to|phaceous
chalky Matter, but not a
chyly Sub&s;tance; for as was before
ob&s;erv'd, if you pour Spirit of Nitre
into any Quantity of boiling new
Milk, and no Conflict or Efferve&s;|cence
will follow, but the Liquor di|vides
it&s;elf into Curd and Whey,
which Whey turns &s;pontaneou&s;ly a|cid,
and the Curd will turn into
<PB N="87" REF="117">
Chee&s;e as hard as a Stone; which
&s;hows that the mo&s;t &s;olid Parts of
Animals may be made of Milk. The
&s;ame Effect of turning Milk into a
hard Curd, may happen in a Human
Body that abounds with Acids.</P>
<P>5. Milk drawn from a &s;ound Ani|mal
fed on Vegetables, &s;tanding in
a Heat equal to that of a Man in
Health, will &s;oon &s;eparate it&s;elf into
a Cream, and a more &s;erous and
ponderous Liquor, which after twelve
Days attains to the highe&s;t Degree
of Acidity. But if the Milk be
drawn from &s;ome Animals that feed
only upon Fle&s;h, that have fa&s;t'd
long, are feveri&s;h, or have under|gone
hard Labour, it will be more
apt to turn rancid and putrify than
turn acid, acquiring fir&s;t a &s;aline
Ta&s;te which is a Sign of Putrefacti|on,
and then it will turn into an
Ichor.</P>
<P>6. If to a quantity of boiling
new Milk you add by Degrees any
<PB N="88" REF="118">
fix'd Alkali, as Salt of Tartar, or
Oil of Tartar <HI>per deliquium,</HI> there
will be a lighter <HI>Coagulum</HI> form'd than
by an acid. The Milk by boiling
will change into a yellow Colour,
and run through all the intermediate
Degrees, till it &s;tops in an inten&s;e
red. The &s;ame thing happens by
the alkaline Powers of the Body; for
when an Animal that gives Suck
turns feveri&s;h, that is, its Juices more
alkaline, the Milk turns from its na|tive
genuine Whitene&s;s to Yellow;
to which the Suckling has an Aver|&s;ion:
This was the Ca&s;e (as the
learned <HI>Boerhaave</HI> tells us) of the
Cows of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>7. If a Nur&s;e &s;hould ab&s;tain from
all acid Vegetables, from Wine,
Malt-Drink, and feed only on Fle&s;h,
and drink Water, her Milk in&s;tead
of turning &s;our will turn putrid, and
&s;mell like Urine. An alkale&s;cent
Diet except that of Water is often
the Ca&s;e of Nur&s;es in great Fami|lies.
<PB N="89" REF="119">
Their Milk &s;ubjects the Child
to Fevers; on the other Hand the
Milk of poor People that feed upon
an Ace&s;cent Vegetable Diet, &s;ubjects
the Child to Di&s;ea&s;es, that depend
upon Acidity in the Bowels, as
Cholick: The Symptoms of &s;uch a
Con&s;titution are a &s;our Smell in
the Faces, &s;our Belchings, 'Di&s;ten|&s;ions
of the Bowels, and Palene&s;s of
the Fle&s;h. The Cure of both Di&s;|ea&s;es
is effected by a change of Diet
in the Nur&s;e from Alkale&s;cent to
Ace&s;cent or contrary ways as the ca&s;e
requires. The be&s;t Diet for Nur&s;es is
a Mixture of both.</P>
<P>It follows likewi&s;e from the forego|ing
Ob&s;ervations, that no Nur&s;e &s;hould
give Suck after twelve Hours fa&s;ting,
and that a tendency to Yellow, is an
early Sign of a Fever in the Nur&s;e.</P>
<P>8. Recent Urine as it is neither
Acid, nor Alkaline, di&s;till'd yields a
Limpid Water, neither Acid nor Al|kaline,
Saline nor Inflammable, and
<PB N="90" REF="120">
what remains at the Bottom of the
Retort is neither Acid nor Alkaline;
but being exhal'd by the Con&s;i&s;tence
of a Syrup, pa&s;&s;eth through all the
degrees of Colours, Yellow, Red,
Brown and Black; and this &s;oapy
Water being calcin'd affords &s;ome
Quantity of Sea Salt, but only in
the ca&s;e of the Animal's taking Sea Salt
with its Food.</P>
<P>9. Hence Sea Salt pa&s;&s;eth unal|ter'd
through all the Strainers of a
human Body, the moderate u&s;e of
it is very proper to pre&s;erve Bodies
through which it pa&s;&s;eth from Cor|ruption,
it detergeth the Ve&s;&s;els, and
keeps the Fluids from Putrefaction.
The Ancients gave the <HI>Sal Gemmoe</HI>
in putrid Fevers.</P>
<P>All human Urine di&s;till'd affords
a Water of a fetid Odour which
that of Animals fed on Vegetables
does not. The Urine of hard
Drinkers and feveri&s;h Per&s;ons affords
a Liquor extremely fetid, but no
<PB N="91" REF="121">
Inflammable Spirit, what is Inflam|mable
&s;tays in the Blood, and affects
the Brain. Great Drinkers commonly
die Apoplectick.</P>
<P>10. The Urine is a Lixivium of
the Salts that are in a human Body,
and the proper Mark of the State
and Quantity of &s;uch Salts, and
therefore very certain Indications for
the choice of Diet may be taken
from the &s;tate of Urine. Though
the Salts of human Urine be neither
Acid nor Alkaline, the&s;e Salts may
by the violent Motion of the Blood
be turn'd Alkaline, and even Corro|&s;ive,
and when they begin to turn &s;o,
they affect the &s;mall and tender Fibres
of the Brain more &s;en&s;ibly than other
Parts.</P>
<P>11. Recent Urine di&s;till'd with a
great Heat, and dry Sand will afford
a Volatile Alkaline Salt, and after
the &s;ame manner the Heat of a hu|man
Body as it grows more inten&s;e
makes the Urine &s;mell &s;till more
<PB N="92" REF="122">
&s;trong, and of a deeper Colour.
But as long as tho&s;e Alkaline Salts
are carried off by Urine, the Brain
and Nerves are le&s;s affected, but on
the contrary, when in a Fever the&s;e
Salts are left behind, that is when
the Urine turns pale, the Patient is
in danger.</P>
<P>12. Recent Urine di&s;till'd with a
fix'd Alkali is turn'd into an Alka|line
Nature, whence it &s;eems proba|ble
that Alkaline Salts taken into a
human Body, have the power of
turning its benign Salts into fiery and
volatile, on which account they
&s;eem improper in inflammatory Di|&s;tempers,
where the Salts are already
too much attenuated. <HI>Hippocrates</HI>
who found out this by Experience
order'd in &s;uch a ca&s;e Things of an
Acid Nature. In general a high co|lour'd
Urine indicates an Acid cool|ing
Diet, for it is certain an Acid
or Alkale&s;cent Diet makes a great
difference in the Salts of a human
Body.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="123">
13. The Rob or Sapa of Urine
di&s;till'd with quick Lime affords a
&s;iery, but not an Alkaline Spirit,
and Lime Water given inwardly in
the Ca&s;e of a Diabetes, will bring
the Urine from Limpid Pale to be
of a higher Colour, which &s;hows the
Power of a Lixivium of quick Lime
to unlock the Salts that are entangled
in the vi&s;cid Juices of &s;ome &s;corbutic
Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>14. Recent Urine will likewi&s;e
cry&s;talize by In&s;pi&s;&s;ation and afford
a Salt neither Acid nor Alkaline,
but of an active Nature, which may
be properly call'd the e&s;&s;ential Salt
of a human Body. Urine becomes
Alkaline by Dige&s;tion in a heat not
greater than that of a human Body,
and throws off a &s;tony Matter to the
Sides of the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>15. The Urine long detain'd in
the Bladder as well as a Gla&s;s will grow
red, fetid, cadaverous and alka|line.
The Ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the
<PB N="94" REF="124">
&s;tagnant Water of Hydropical Per|&s;ons,
which at la&s;t produce a Drought
and feveri&s;h Heat.</P>
<P>16. From hence very good Rules
may be drawn for the Diet of Ne|phritick
and Drop&s;ical Per&s;ons, that
it ought to be &s;uch as is oppo&s;ite to
and &s;ubdueth the Alkale&s;cent Nature
of the Salts in the Serum of their
Blood; tho&s;e manife&s;t them&s;elves in
the Urine, which as was &s;aid before
is the Lixivium of the whole Body.
Sal Ammoniac may likewi&s;e be ob|tain'd
from Urine, which is neare&s;t
to the Nature of an Animal Salt.</P>
<P>17. The White of an Egg re&s;em|bles
the Nutritious Juice of an Ani|mal
Body, from the White of an Egg
every part of a perfect Animal is
form'd, for during the Incubation of
the Hen, there is nothing of the Egg
con&s;um'd but the White.</P>
<P>18. The White of an Egg is a
vi&s;cous, unactive, in&s;ipid, inodorous
Liquor capable of mixing with Wa|ter,
<PB N="95" REF="125">
and &s;o mild that appply'd to the
mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part, the Eye, it cau&s;eth
no Pain.</P>
<P>19. It is neither Acid nor Alka|line,
for if the Juices of an Animal
Body were either, &s;o as by the mix|ture
of the oppo&s;ites, to cau&s;e an
Ebullition, they would bur&s;t the
Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>20. The White of an Egg gra|dually
di&s;&s;olves by Heat, exceeding a
little the Heat of a human Body, a
greater degree of Heat will thicken it
into a white, opaque, dry, vi&s;cous
Ma&s;s, and this is the Ca&s;e of the Se|rum
of the Blood, upon which dif|ferent
Degrees of Heat produce con|trary
Effects.</P>
<P>Attention ought to be had to this
Maxim in the Management of Diet,
Exerci&s;e and all outward and inward
Application to human Bodies and
warm Catapla&s;ms di&s;cu&s;s, but &s;calding
hot may confirm the Tumor. Heat in
general doth not re&s;olve and attenuate
<PB N="96" REF="126">
the Juices of a human Body, for too
great Heat will produce Concre|tions.</P>
<P>21. Spirit of Wine mix'd cold
with the White of an Egg, coagu|lates
it as much as boil'd Water,
which &s;hows that Spirit of Wine is
an immediate Styptick; &s;o that in|jected
into the Veins it is &s;udden
Death, and taken by the Mouth in
great Quantities is &s;ometimes &s;udden,
but always certain Death. Spirituous
Liquors are &s;o far from attenuating,
volatilizing and rendring per&s;pirable
the Animal Fluids, that it rather
conden&s;eth them and hardneth the
Solids, and therefore properly us'd
to hinder the growth of young Ani|mals,
and this it will do by mere
external Friction; thereby coagulating
the Juices in the Extremities of the
Ve&s;&s;els, hardening and aboli&s;hing the
Canals, and &s;o increa&s;ing their Re|&s;i&s;tance
again&s;t the Force of the in|fluent
Liquid, which would other|wi&s;e
<PB N="97" REF="127">
&s;tretch them. This plainly de|mon&s;trates
the bad Effects of inflam|mable
Spirits on human Bodies.</P>
<P>22. The Water gain'd from the
White of an Egg by a gentle Di&s;til|lation,
is neither Acid nor Alkaline;
but by a &s;trong Di&s;tillation it affords
an Alkaline Spirit, Salt, two kinds of
Oil, and an Earth, which is another
in&s;tance of the Alterations great de|grees
of Heat cau&s;e in Animal Sub|jects;
and hence we may conclude
that Volatile Salts never exi&s;t in
their own form, in an Animal Bo|dy,
that the Heat requir'd to make
them Volatile endangers the life of
the Animal; hence a highly Alka&s;|cent
Diet in hot Con&s;titutions mu&s;t
be hurtful,</P>
<P>23. The White of an Egg will
putrify and turn Alkaline by Di|ge&s;tion,
a &s;ingle Grain of this pu|trify'd
Sub&s;tance has operated like a
Poi&s;on, cau&s;ing Vomiting and a Loo&s;e|ne&s;s,
the Antidote of this Poi&s;on is &s;ome
<PB N="98" REF="128">
Acid Liquor, and &s;uch are indeed in|dicated
when the Juices of a human
Body verge to Putrefaction. The
White of an Egg during Incubation
is di&s;&s;olv'd, but not properly &s;peak|ing
putrify'd, for in &s;uch a State it
would be unfit for Nutrition.</P>
<P>24. It &s;eems probable that the
Bile in a human Body by &s;tagnating
putrifies, cau&s;ing a Cholera Morbus
in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, and a Pe&s;tilen|tial
Di&s;temper when it mixeth with
the Blood. In &s;uch a &s;tate of the
Bile, the Aliment ought to be thin
to dilute, demulcent to temper, or
acid to &s;ubdue and de&s;troy an Alka|line
Acrimony.</P>
<P>The Nutritious Juice of a healthy
Animal re&s;embles the White of an
Egg in mo&s;t of its Qualities, but
this nutritious Juice being a &s;ubtile
Liquor, &s;carce obtainable from a
human Body, the Serum of the
Blood is fairly &s;ub&s;tituted in its
place.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="129">
25. The Serum of the Blood
&s;tands the foremention'd Trials, and
di&s;covers it&s;elf to be neither Acid
nor Alkaline, only Oil of Vitriol
thickens and the Oil of Tartar thins
it a little.</P>
<P>26. The Serum of the Blood di|ge&s;ted
in a Heat not greater than
that of a human Body in health,
will gradually become thinner, be|gin
to &s;mell Cadaverous and putrify,
and at la&s;t, like the White of an Egg,
turn to an Alkaline Ichor, that fer|ments
with Acids, and committed
to Di&s;tillation affords like the White
of an Egg, an Alkaline Salt. This
&s;hows the Effect of gentle Heat in di&s;|&s;olving
Coagulations, for even the
Vi&s;cous Matter which lies like Leather
upon the extrava&s;ated Blood of Pleu|ritick
People may be di&s;&s;olv'd by a
due Degree of Heat.</P>
<P>27. When the Blood &s;tagnates in
any part of the Body, it fir&s;t coa|gulates
<PB N="100" REF="130">
then re&s;olves, turns Alkaline,
Putrid and Corro&s;ive.</P>
<P>28. As the Serum of the Blood
is re&s;olvable by a &s;mall Heat, a
greater Heat coagulates it &s;o as to
turn it horny like Parchment, but
when it is throughly putrified it will
no longer concrete. The Blood of
&s;ome Per&s;ons who have dy'd of the
Plague could not be made to con|crete,
by rea&s;on of the Putrefaction
already begun.</P>
<P>29. The Serum of Blood coa|gulates
like the White of an Egg
with cold Spirit of Wine.</P>
<P>30. The Serum of the Blood is
more Saline than the White of an
Egg, perhaps by the Salts taken in
Nouri&s;hment, and has &s;omething of
a more fetid urinous Scent.</P>
<P>31. The Serum of the Blood af|fords
by Di&s;tillation an exceeding
limpid Water, neither Acid nor Al|kaline,
which &s;hows that the mo&s;t
<PB N="101" REF="131">
&s;ubtile part of the Blood approacheth
nearer to Water than any other Li|quor,
and that the Blood naturally
contains no volatile Salt.</P>
<P>32. The&s;e Experiments are to be
made on the Blood of healthy Ani|mals:
It is po&s;&s;ible in a lax and
weak habit of Body, where the Chyle
is not throughly a&s;&s;imilated by Cir|culation,
but floats on the Blood like
Oil, that &s;uch a Serum might af|ford
quite other Contents, and per|haps
even an inflammable Spirit,
by rea&s;on of the Vegetable Nature of
the Chyle.</P>
<P>33. The Serum of the Blood by
a &s;trong Di&s;tillation affords a Spirit,
or Volatile Alkaline Salt, and two
kinds of Oil, and an Earth which
&s;till proves the Effect of Heat in hu|man
Bodies, in changing the benign
Salts into Alkaline.</P>
<P>34. The Serum of the Blood is
attenuated by Circulation, &s;o as to
pa&s;s into the minute&s;t Channels of an
<PB N="102" REF="132">
Animal Body, and become fit Nutri|ment
for it, but by the continual At|trition,
and Heat of &s;ome of its Particles
becomes &s;harp and offen&s;ive to the
Body: Nature has provided the Kid|neys
to di&s;charge them. Hence ap|pears
as by Prop. VIII. Chap. II.
the continual Nece&s;&s;ity of a fre&s;h Re|cruit
of Chyle, which like an Emul|&s;ion
dilutes the Serum, the Mi&s;chiefs

that ought to pa&s;s by Urine, and
likewi&s;e the proper Indications for

<P>35. It appears by Experiments
made upon Bones, and other Ani|mal

dry Bone di&s;till'd affords a great
Quantity of in&s;ipid Water, after the
Bones have undergone the Violence

Salt, only &s;ometimes in Animals
that take Sea Salt, there will be a
<PB N="103" REF="133">
very &s;mall Proportion of that in the
A&s;hes.</P>
<P>36. The Animal Fluids and So|lids
are re&s;olvable into the &s;ame
Principles, and this is true not only
of the Fluids and Solids them&s;elves,
but likewi&s;e of all Preparations of
them. The Gellies made of the
Decoction of lean Fle&s;h, and Bones
in clear Water are re&s;olvable into
the &s;ame Principles as the Fle&s;h and
Bones them&s;elves, and if the&s;e De|coctions
be repeated till the Water
comes off clear, the Remainder yields
no Salt by Di&s;tillation and little Oil;
therefore it is po&s;&s;ible to extract the
whole Virtues of Animal Sub&s;tances
by Decoctions, but the gentle&s;t, ex|tract
the mo&s;t volatile and fine&s;t
Parts after the Oil or Fat is &s;epa|rated.</P>
<P>37. Preparations by Cookery of
Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h ought to be made with
regard to rectifying their mo&s;t noxi|ous
and &s;limy Sub&s;tances, and to re|tain
<PB N="104" REF="134">
tho&s;e that are mo&s;t Nutritious;
&s;uch Preparations as retain the Oil
or Fat are mo&s;t heavy to the Sto|mach,
which makes bak'd Meat hard
of Dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>38. By Experiments of the Mix|ture
of different Sub&s;tances with the
Serum of the Blood, it appears that
all Volatile Alkalis thin it, and Acids
coagulate it. I &s;aid Volatile Alkalis
for the Serum being mix'd with an
equal Quantity of Oil of Tartar <HI>per
deliquium,</HI> will grow &s;omewhat thicker,
and an Alkaline Vapour ari&s;eth from
the Mixture; but the fame Propor|tion
of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac
makes the Serum thinner without
cau&s;ing any Alteration in the Scent
or Colour.</P>
<P>39. Spirit of Vitriol pour'd to
pure unmix'd Serum coagulates it
as if it had been boil'd. Spirit
of Sea Salt makes a perfect Coagu|lation
of the Serum likewi&s;e, but
with &s;ome different Phenomena from
<PB N="105" REF="135">
the former. The Spirit of Nitre pro|duceth
the &s;ame Effect.</P>
<P>The Serum which is mix'd with
an Alkali being pour'd to that which
is mix'd with an Acid rai&s;eth an Ef|ferve&s;cence,
at the Ce&s;&s;ation of which
the Salts, of which the Acid was com|pos'd,
will be regenerated.</P>
<P>40. Vinegar is an Acid of a very
peculiar Nature cooling and yet not
coagulating; for Spirit of Vinegar
gently dilutes the Serum of the Blood,
and even the Oil of Tartar being
pour'd to this Mixture cau&s;eth no
Efferve&s;cence; tho' <HI>Honiberg</HI> &s;ays, that
Spirit of Vinegar concentrated, and
reduc'd to its greate&s;t &s;trength will
coagulate the Serum.</P>
<P>41. The Mixture of the Solutions
of Sea-Salt, Sal Gemmae, Borax Ni|tre,
and Sal Ammoniac, cau&s;e no
change of Colour in the Serum; but
di&s;&s;olve its Texture a little, all except
that of the Borax. Glaubers Salt
maketh a &s;trong Coagulation of the
<PB N="106" REF="136">
Serum by rea&s;on of the Oil of Vi|triol
it contains.</P>
<P>42. All &s;aponaceous Sub&s;tances,
which are a Mixture of Oil and al|kaline
Salt, thin the Blood without
cau&s;ing any Efferve&s;cence; Spirit of
Harts-Horn given in great Quanti|ties
will produce Hemorrhages,
which I have known by Experience,
and therefore is very improper in ma|ny
Ca&s;es. <HI>Boerhaave</HI> in his Chymi&s;|try,
&s;ays, That <HI>Sal volatile oleo&s;um</HI>
will coagulate the Serum on Ac|count
of the Alcahol or rectify'd Spi|rit
it contains.</P>
<P>43. The Tincture of Salt of Tar|tar,
<HI>viz.</HI> a Preparation of the high|e&s;t
rectify'd Spirit of Wine, and the
&s;tronge&s;t fix'd Alkali, pre&s;erves the
Serum in a neutral State; for the Spi|rit
of Wine tends to coagulate, and
the Alkali on the contrary to di&s;&s;olve
it, whence it becomes neither thicker
nor thinner.</P>

upon them, according to

their different Natures. There|fore,</P>
<P>1. The proper Way of treating
the Subject of Aliment is to con&s;ider
the Actions of the &s;everal Sorts of it

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. II.</HEAD>
<P>The Di&s;ea&s;es of Human Bodies
often require Sub&s;tances of more
active Principles, than what are
found in common Aliment, in or|der
to produce &s;udden Alterations:
But where &s;uch Alterations are not
nece&s;&s;ary, the &s;ame Effect may be
obtained by the repeated Force of
Diet, with more Safety to the Bo|dy,
where the le&s;s &s;udden Chan|ges

by its Quantity, for accord|ing
<PB N="109" REF="139">
to the Laws of Motion, if the
Bulk and Activity of Aliment and
Medicines are in reciprocal Propor|tion,
the Effect will be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>1. All Bodies which by the Ani|mal
Faculties can be changed into
the Fluids and Solids of our Bodies
are call'd Aliment. But to take it
in the large&s;t Sen&s;e, by Aliment I
under&s;tand every thing which a Hu|man
Creature takes in common Diet,
as Meat, Drink, and Sea&s;oning, as
Salt, Spice, Vinegar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. It has been explain'd <HI>Prop.</HI> VII.

through the capillary Tubes at la&s;t,
as it were &s;tagnates and unites it&s;elf
to the Ve&s;&s;el or Tube through which
it flows. But in this Motion it will
act differently, both upon the Fluid
and Solid, according to its different
Nature. Every thing that acts up|on
the Fluids mu&s;t at the &s;ame time
act upon the Solids, and contrary|wi&s;e,

<PB N="110" REF="140">
<HEAD>PROP. III.</HEAD>
<P>To enumerate the different Acti|ons
upon the Fluids and Solids of a
Human Body.</P>
<P>There is a multitude of Words to
expre&s;s the various Alterations which
are produc'd in a Human Body by
Diet and Medicines, but as far as
relates to our pre&s;ent Subject, they
may be reduc'd to the following ge|neral
Heads.</P>
<P>1. The Actions upon the Solids
are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Stimulating or increa&s;ing
their Vibrations or o&s;cillatory Mo|tions.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Contracting, that is
dimini&s;hing their Length, and in|crea&s;ing

or making them more flexible
in their le&s;s coherent Parts. And
<HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Con&s;tipating or &s;hutting up
the Cavity of the capillary Tubes.</P>
<P>2. The Actions upon the Fluids
are either changing their Qualities or
their Quantity.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="141">
3. Their Qualities are chang'd by,
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Attenuating and conden&s;ing, that
is dimini&s;hing or increa&s;ing the Bulk
of their Particles. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By rend|ring
them acrimonious or mild.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> By coagulating and diluting,
that is, making their Parts more or
le&s;s coherent. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> By increa&s;ing
or dimini&s;hing their Motion through
the Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>4. The Quantity of the Fluids is
increas'd or dimini&s;h'd by the Increa&s;e
or Diminution of the Quantity of A|liment;
or by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing or pro|moting
Animal Secretions.</P>
<P>5. That all the&s;e Actions can be
perform'd by Aliment as well as Me|dicines,
is plain from Rea&s;on, Ex|perience
and in &s;ome Ca&s;es by ocu|lar
Demon&s;tration, by ob&s;erving the
Effects of different Sub&s;tances upon
the Fluids and Solids of a Human
Body when the Ve&s;&s;els are open, and
gape by a Wound or Sore. The Ef|fects
of tepid Water and farmaceous
<PB N="112" REF="142">
Sub&s;tances in relaxing; of Spirits, in
&s;topping Hemorrages, and con&s;olidat|ing
the Fibres; the Power of al|kaline
Ab&s;orbents in &s;ubduing Acri|mony,
and of Oil in &s;topping Per|&s;piration
is well known to Chirur|geons,
who are likewi&s;e well ac|quainted
with the Influence of Diet
upon the Wounds and Sores of their
Patients, and from the Condition of
the one, can gue&s;s at the Errors or
Regularity of the other. Acrid Sub|&s;tances
will break the Ve&s;&s;els, and
produce an Ichor in&s;tead of laudable
Pus. The chief Intention of Chi|rurgery
as well as Medicine, is keep|ing
a ju&s;t <HI>Equilibrium</HI> between the in|fluent
Fluids, and va&s;cular Solids,
when the Ve&s;&s;els are too lax, and
don't &s;ufficiently re&s;i&s;t the Influx of
the Liquid, it begets a <HI>Fungus</HI> or
proud Fle&s;h; when the Balance is on
the other &s;ide, it produceth a Cica|trice.
Were it not criminal to try
Experiments upon Patients, which
<PB N="113" REF="143">
they too often try upon them&s;elves,
I could an&s;wer that the Doctrine of
this Chapter would be verify'd by
Experience in Wounds and Sores, as
it is often perceptible even in an

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Effects of diffe|rent
alimentary Sub&s;tances upon the
Fluids and Solids of a Human Body.</P>
<P>1. The fir&s;t &s;ort of Alimentary
Sub&s;tances are &s;uch as are of &s;o mild
a Nature, that they act with &s;mall
Force upon the Solids, and as the
Action and Re-action are equal, the
&s;malle&s;t Degree of Force in the Solids
dige&s;ts and a&s;&s;imilates them; of &s;uch
&s;ort is Milk and Broths made of the
mu&s;cular Parts of Animals, which are
as it were already prepar'd, and ea&s;i|ly
converted into Animal Sub&s;tances;
the&s;e are proper. Nouri&s;hment for
weak Bodies, and agree perfectly
<PB N="114" REF="144">
well with them, unle&s;s there be &s;ome
particular Acrimony in the Stomach,
which &s;ometimes makes them offen|&s;ive,
and which Cu&s;tom at la&s;t will
overcome.</P>
<P>2. Tho&s;e Things which &s;timulate
the Solids, produce the greate&s;t Al|terations
in an Animal Body. This
is &s;een in many In&s;tances. Violent
Sneezing produceth Convul&s;ions in
all the Mu&s;cles of Re&s;piration, and
an univer&s;al Secretion of all the Hu|mours,
Tears, Spittle, Sweat, U|rine,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> So great an Alteration can
be produc'd only by the Tickling of
a Feather, and if the Action of
Sneezing &s;hould be continu'd by &s;ome
very acrid Sub&s;tance, it will at la&s;t
produce Head-ach, Vomiting, uni|ver&s;al
Convul&s;ions, Fever and Death,
Therefore &s;uch active Sub&s;tances as
taken inwardly in &s;mall Quantities
make great Alterations in the Fluids,
mu&s;t produce this Effect by their &s;ti|mulating
Quality.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="145">
3. Acrid Sub&s;tances, which are
&s;mall enough to pa&s;s into the capil|lary
Tubes, mu&s;t &s;timulate the &s;mall
Fibres, and irritate them into greater
Contraction, and &s;tronger Vibrati|ons.</P>
<P>4. Many things which we take
as Aliment, or with our Aliment
have this Quality in &s;ome degree:
As the Juices of acid Vegetables,
fermented Liquors, e&s;pecially &s;harp
Wines, fermented Spirits, aromatical
Vegetables as Fennel, Savory, Thyme,
Garlick, Onions, Leeks, Mu&s;tard,
which abound with a volatile pun|gent
Salt, all Spices, in general all
Vegetables, which being corrupted
ea&s;ily re&s;olve them&s;elves into a fetid
oily Alkali. Onions, Garlick, Pep|per,
Salt, and Vinegar taken in great
Quantities by their <HI>Stimulus,</HI> excite
a momentary Heat and Fever, and
therefore in &s;ome Ca&s;es to be men|tion'd
afterwards are very proper.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="146">
5. The &s;olid Parts may be con|tracted
various Ways. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By di&s;|&s;olving
their Continuity, for when
a Fibre is cut through, it contracts
it&s;elf at both Ends; therefore all
Things which are &s;o acrimonious as
to de&s;troy the &s;mall Fibres mu&s;t
contract them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whatever
makes a Depletion of the Ve&s;&s;els
gives room to the Fibres to contract;
therefore Ab&s;tinence produceth this
Effect in the be&s;t Manner. What|ever
&s;hortens the Fibres, by in&s;inuat|ing
it&s;elf into their Parts, as Water
in a Rope, contracts; fermented
Spirits po&s;&s;e&s;s their Quality in a great
Degree.</P>
<P>6. The more oily any Spirit is,
the more pernicious, becau&s;e it is
harder to be eluted by the Blood.
Brandy is more ea&s;y to be &s;o, than
Spirit of Juniper, and that than Spi|rit
of Ani&s;e&s;eed. Compound aro|matical
Spirits de&s;troy, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By
their fermentative Heat. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By
<PB N="117" REF="147">
their oily Tenacity. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By a
cau&s;tick Quality re&s;iding in Spices
apt to de&s;troy the &s;olid Parts, but
the&s;e Qualities render them proper
in &s;ome Ca&s;es taken in &s;mall Quan|tities.</P>
<P>7. Fermented Spirits contract,
harden and con&s;olidate many Fibres
together, aboli&s;hing many Canals, e&s;|pecially
where the Fibres are the ten|dere&s;t
as in the Brain, by which Qua|lity
they de&s;troy the Memory and
intellectual Faculties.</P>
<P>8. Acid au&s;tere Vegetables have
this Faculty of Contracting and
&s;trengthning the Fibres without &s;ome
of the bad Effects of fermented Spi|rits,
as all Kinds of Sorrel (the Vir|tues
of which lie in an acid a&s;trin|gent
Salt, a &s;overeign Antidote a|gain&s;t
the putre&s;cent bilious Alkali)
&s;everal Kinds of Fruits, as Quinces,
&s;ome &s;orts of Pears with the Marma|lades
made of them, Medlars, Ca|pers,
Barberries, Pomegranates, Pur&s;|lain,
<PB N="118" REF="148">
&s;uch are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h'd by
a rough &s;typtick Ta&s;te. Among&s;t
Drinks Au&s;tere Wines, unripe Fruits
likewi&s;e have the &s;ame Quality, but
are apt to ob&s;truct the Nerves, and
occa&s;ion Pal&s;ies.</P>
<P>9. Relaxing the Fibres is making
them flexible, or ea&s;y to be leng|then'd
without Rupture, which is done
only in the capillary va&s;cular Solids.
Among&s;t Liquids endued with this
Quality of relaxing, warm Water
&s;tands fir&s;t, next watery Decoctions
of farinaceous Vegetables, or Grains,
as Oats, Barley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All &s;weet and
mild Garden-fruits, almo&s;t all Pot|Herbs,
Spinage, Betes, Cabbage, Cole|worts,
and all that Tribe. Red Cab|bage
be&s;ides is reckon'd a good Pec|toral;
&s;ome of the lacte&s;cent and
pape&s;cent Plants, as Lettuce, Cicho|ry,
who&s;e Milk is anodyne and re|&s;olvent,
therefore good in Di&s;ea&s;es
of the Liver; but all &s;uch Vegeta|bles
mu&s;t be unfermented, for Fer|mentation
<PB N="119" REF="149">
changes their Nature. Oils
expre&s;s'd from mild Plants, Animal
Oils, Cream, Butter, Marrow, which
la&s;t is of all oily Sub&s;tances the mo&s;t
penetrating.</P>
<P>10. It is not probable that any
thing which Human Creatures take
as Aliment, &s;hould have the Quality
of entirely con&s;tipating or &s;hutting
up the capillary Ve&s;&s;els, becau&s;e &s;uch
Sub&s;tances could hardly enter the
Lacteals, and if they did, would &s;top
the Circulation in the Lungs, but all
vi&s;cid Aliment &s;uch as is made of
farinaceous Sub&s;tances un&s;ermented,
neither pa&s;s the Lacteals, nor circu|late
&s;o ea&s;ily as the &s;ame Sub&s;tances
fermented. Some of the <HI>Fungus</HI> Kind
gather'd by mi&s;take for edible Mu&s;h|rooms,
have produced a Difficulty
of Breathing.</P>
<P>11. The Qualities of the Fluids
can be likewi&s;e chang'd by Diet, as
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By attenuating or dimini&s;hing
the Cohe&s;ion of the Parts of the
<PB N="120" REF="150">
Fluid. The Cohe&s;ion of the Parts
depends upon the Weight and Quan|tity,
therefore Ab&s;tinence and a &s;len|der
Diet attenuates, becau&s;e Deple|tion
of the Ve&s;&s;els gives room to the
Fluid to expand it&s;elf.</P>
<P>12. Whatever penetrates and di|lutes
at the &s;ame time; therefore
Water impregnated with &s;ome pene|trating
Salt, attenuates mo&s;t &s;trongly;
Water with <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> will pa&s;s
through a Human Skin. To this
Quality may be ju&s;tly a&s;crib'd the
great Effects of medicated Waters,
all &s;timulating Sub&s;tances by increa&s;|ing
the Motion of the Blood atte|nuate,
unle&s;s they increa&s;e the Mo|tion
&s;o much, as at la&s;t to produce
Coagulation.</P>
<P>13. Thickening the Blood is mo&s;t
ea&s;ily brought about by exhaling the
mo&s;t liquid Parts by &s;udori&s;ick or
watery Evaporations; but this brings
it into a morbid State. Acid au&s;tere
Vegetables before mention'd, have
<PB N="121" REF="151">
this Quality of conden&s;ing the
Fluids, as well as &s;trengthning the
Solids.</P>
<P>14. The Blood of labouring Peo|ple
is more den&s;e and heavy than of
tho&s;e who live a &s;edentary life, and
the Di&s;ea&s;es which People imagine
proceed from the Thickne&s;s of Blood,
come often from the contrary Cau&s;e;
too thin Blood &s;trays into the im|mediately
&s;ubordinate Ve&s;&s;els which
are de&s;tin'd to carry Humours &s;ecre|ted
from the Blood, according to
what was &s;aid Prop. V. Chap. II.
This cau&s;es an Ob&s;truction fal&s;ly
a&s;crib'd to the Thickne&s;s of the Blood.</P>
<P>The Qualities of Blood in a healthy
State are to be florid when let out
of the Ve&s;&s;el, the red Part congeal|ing
&s;trongly and &s;oon together in a
Ma&s;s moderately tenaceous,&s;wimming
in the Serum, which ought to be with|out
any very yellow or greeni&s;h ca&s;t.
The Gravity of Blood to Sea-Water
is as 26 is to 25, that of the Serum to
<PB N="122" REF="152">
the &s;ame Water, as 300 to 353, it's
an ea&s;y matter to examine extrava|&s;ated
Blood by the&s;e Marks.</P>
<P>15. Acrimony is not Natural, but
induc'd into the Fluids of an Ani|mal
Body. Acrimony may be intro|duc'd
by Diet, that is either Muria|tick,
(Briny) or Acid, which likewi&s;e
is of two &s;orts, of things naturally
Acid; or (made &s;o by Fermentation)
Aromatick, con&s;i&s;ting of Salts, and
highly exalted Oils, intimately uni|ted.
Or <HI>Secondly,</HI> by increa&s;ing the
Velocity of the Blood, and con&s;e|quently
the Attrition of the Parts.</P>
<P>16. Acrimony in the Blood it &s;elf
is commonly of three Sorts accord|ing
to the Nature of the Salts in
which it re&s;ides. Acid, Alkaline or
Muriatick as in the Sea Scurvy, but
the la&s;t approaches more towards the
Alkaline, and admits of the &s;ame
Cure: Acid Acrimony re&s;ides chiefly
in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, proceeding often
from the Weakne&s;s of Dige&s;tion, and
<PB N="123" REF="153">
the too long Duration of Vegetables,
and Milk in the Stomach. Animal
Sub&s;tanccs are all Alkale&s;cent, of
Vegetable Sub&s;tances &s;ome are Acid,
others Alkale&s;cent, and each Sort is
to be u&s;ed according to the two dif|ferent
Intentions.</P>
<P>17. Antiacid Vegetables are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
All kinds of Garlick, Onions, Leeks,
and Selery, the Acti&s;corbutick
Plants, Carrots, Turnips, Eringo
Roots, A&s;paragus, Hor&s;e-radi&s;h, Mu|&s;tard,
Cabbage. <HI>Secondly,</HI> All Ani|mal
Sub&s;tances e&s;pecially of &s;uch as
live on other Animals; the Juices
of which are more Alkale&s;cent than
of the Animals which live upon
Vegetables, &s;uch are mo&s;t Fi&s;hes, e&s;|pecially
&s;ome of the Te&s;taceous kind.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Water as it dilutes and &s;ubdues
Acidity. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Oils are Antia|cids
&s;o far as they blunt Acri|mony,
but as &s;ome times they
are hard of Dige&s;tion they produce
Acrimony of another Sort.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="154">
18. On the other Hand when the
Acrimony is Alkaline, which is more
frequently the Ca&s;e in the circulating
Juices. The proper Diet is Decocti|ons
of Farinaceous Vegetables which
&s;eem appointed by Nature, for the
Vegetable Diet of human Creatures.
This Alkaline Acrimony indicates
the copious u&s;e of Vinegar, and
Acid Fruits, as Oranges, which con|tain
a Juice mo&s;t effectual in the
Cure of the Muriatick Scurvy of Ma|riners;
the Juice of Lemons is like|wi&s;e
more proper and more cooling
and a&s;tringent than that of Oranges.
In this ca&s;e all the mild Anti&s;corbu|ticks
are indicated as Sorrel, Cichory,
Lettuce, Apples, and of Liquids
Whey: On the contrary all the A|crid
Anti&s;corbuticks, as Scurvygra&s;s,
Hor&s;eradi&s;hes, Mu&s;tard, &amp;c. are hurt|ful
in this hot Scurvy.</P>
<P>19. There is a third &s;ort of
Anti&s;corbuticks proper in this Alka|le&s;cent
State of the Fluids, which
<PB N="125" REF="155">
is call'd A&s;tringent, &s;uch as Pome|granates,
Capers, and mo&s;t of the
common Pickles prepar'd with Vine|gar.
The Extremity of Alkali is
Putrefaction. All Acid Sub&s;tances,
and Sea Salt re&s;i&s;t Putrefaction, but
as it is a &s;harp &s;olid Body unalterable
in an Animal Body, when it is taken
in too great Quantities in a con&s;tant
Diet of Salt Meat, it breaks the
Ve&s;&s;els, produceth Ero&s;ions of the
&s;olid Parts, and all the Symptoms of
the Sea-Scurvy, which is to be cured
by Acid Vegetables, and not by hot
Anti&s;corbutick; all Spices likewi&s;e
induce this Acrimony, as was hinted
before.</P>
<P>20. There are other Sub&s;tances
which are oppo&s;ite to both Sorts of
Acrimony which are call'd demul|cent
or mild, becau&s;e they blunt or
&s;heath the&s;e &s;harp Salts, as Farinaceous
Legumes, &s;uch as Pea&s;e, Beans, Len|tils.
Native Oils of Animals, as
Cream, Butter, Marrow, which la&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="156">
is a Specifick in that Scurvy which
occa&s;ions a Crackling of the Bones,
in which ca&s;e Marrow performs its
natural Function of moi&s;tening them.
All Plants which are without Smell
or pungent Ta&s;te are demulcent, as
likewi&s;e all the Alimentary Parts of
&s;ound Animals, for none of their
Juices will hurt the Eye or a fre&s;h
Wound. Acrimony which is not
vi&s;cid may be cur'd by Diet, but Vi&s;|cidity
requires more active Sub&s;tances
to di&s;&s;olve it.</P>
<P>21. Whatever renders the motion
of the Blood more languid than na|tural
di&s;po&s;eth to an Acid Acrimo|ny:
What accelerates the Motion of
the Blood beyond what is natural
di&s;po&s;eth to an Alkaline Acrimony.</P>
<P>22. The next Alteration which
is made in the Fluids is rendering it
more thin, which is perform'd by
Diluting, there is no real Diluent but
Water, every Fluid is diluent as it
contains Water in it. Water dilutes,
<PB N="127" REF="157">
but at the &s;ame time relaxeth, this
la&s;t Quality is taken off by mixing
&s;ome Acid Juice with it: Water
mix'd with Acids re&s;i&s;ts the Heat
and Alkale&s;cent State of the Fluids,
as long as there is Thir&s;t, a quick
Pul&s;e, Dryne&s;s, with a free Pa&s;&s;age by
Urine, and Stricture of the Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o
long is Water &s;afely taken.</P>
<P>23. Oppo&s;ite to Dilution is Co|agulation
or Thickening, which is
perform'd by di&s;&s;ipating the mo&s;t
liquid Parts by Heat, or by in&s;i|nuating
&s;ome Sub&s;tances which make
the Parts of the Fluid cohere more
&s;trongly. All Vegetables which make
a black Tincture with the Vitriol of
Steel have this Quality, they have
commonly a rough &s;typtick Ta&s;te:
Vinegar as was &s;aid before is an A|cid
very particular, for it doth not
coagulate: Inflammable Spirits co|agulate
the Fluids, and harden the
Solids in a &s;trong Degree.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="158">
24. Re&s;olving what is congeal'd
is turning it into a Fluid again; this
can be perform'd by watery Liquors,
impregnated with &s;ome penetrating
Salt, but more effectually by &s;apa|naceous
Sub&s;tances compos'd of Oil
and Salt, &s;uch are Honey, and the
Robs and Gellies of mo&s;t Fruits.
Vinegar and Honey mix'd is a &s;trong
re&s;olvent. Spi&s;&s;itude is &s;ubdu'd by
Acrid things, and Acrimony by in|&s;pi&s;&s;itating.</P>
<P>25. The &s;econd Manner of Ope|rating
upon the Fluids is by in|crea&s;ing
or dimini&s;hing their Quan|tity,
the fir&s;t is perform'd by a plen|tiful
Diet, and the Suppre&s;&s;ion of E|vacuations,
the &s;econd either by a
&s;pare Diet or promoting the Animal
Secretions, that is expelling the
Fluids out of the Body. Tho' Secre|tions
of the laudable Juices are be&s;t
accompli&s;h'd by increa&s;ing the Fluids.</P>
<P>26. Whatever generates a Quan|tity
of good Chyle, mu&s;t likewi&s;e
<PB N="129" REF="159">
generate Milk, &s;uch is new Milk
&s;ea&s;on'd with Sugar or Salt. This
will increa&s;e the Milk when it is di|mini&s;h'd
by the too great u&s;e of
Fle&s;h Meat: Gruels made of Grains,
Broths, Malt Drink not much
hopp'd, Po&s;&s;et Drinks, and in gene|ral
whatever relaxeth, have the &s;ame
Effect.</P>
<P>27. There are as many good
Pectorals of the Alimentary, as of
the Medicinal kind, as all Prepara|tions
of Barley, Oats, Honey, all
Saponaceous Sub&s;tances before-men|tion'd
which attenuate Flegm.</P>
<P>28. There is Aliment lenitive ex|pelling
the faeces without &s;timulating
the Bowels, &s;uch are Anim al Oils
quite fre&s;h (for by &s;tanding they
grow Acrid) as Cream, Butter, Mar|row,
Broths made of the Parts of
Animals about the Me&s;entery, Oils
expre&s;s'd from ripe Fruits (from un|ripe
they are au&s;tere and a&s;tringent)
the Juices of mild and ripe Fruits,
<PB N="130" REF="160">
Decoctions of farinaceous Vegeta|bles,
natural Soaps as Honey, Sugar,
&s;uch Diet is proper for the hot Con|&s;titutions
of warm Countries, where
&s;trong Per&s;piration exhales the Moi&s;|ture.
Water, Milk, Whey, taken in
the open Air without much exerci&s;e
&s;o as to make them per&s;pire, relax
the Belly.</P>
<P>29. There are Aliments which
be&s;ides this lubricating Quality, &s;ti|mulate
in a &s;mall Degree. Gellies
made of the &s;olid parts of Animals,
as of their Horns, &s;timulate by the
Salts that are in them. Salted Fle&s;h
which often throws Ships-crews into
Fluxes, Shell Fi&s;hes which have a Sa|line
Ta&s;te, Garden Fruits which have
any Acrimony, mo&s;t &s;orts of Berries,
&s;ome of which will produce Diarrhoeas,
warm Water mix'd with Honey,
and Honey mix'd with Acids di&s;&s;olve
Flegm in the Bowels. There are o|thers
which promote the Secretion of
Bile, &s;uch as all natural Soaps, the
<PB N="131" REF="161">
Juices of Fruits &s;harp, and &s;weet, e&s;|pecially
Grapes, the immoderate u&s;e
of which will produce a Cholera Mor|bus.</P>
<P>30. Diureticks are Decoctions,
Emul&s;ions and Oils of Emollient
Vegetables, in &s;o far as they relax
the Urinary Pa&s;&s;ages: Such as relax
ought to be try'd before &s;uch as force
and &s;timulate. Tho&s;e Emollients
ought to be taken in open Air to
hinder them from per&s;piring, and on
empty Stomachs. Vegetables which
abound with e&s;&s;ential Salt, are Diu|retick
by &s;timulating, as Sorrel,
Chervil, Par&s;ly, Eringo, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
likewi&s;e all &s;uch as contain an Aro|matical
Bal&s;am as A&s;paragus, Fen|nel,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>31. As to Sudorificks, it ought
to be con&s;ider'd that the Liquid which
goes off by Sweat, is often the mo&s;t
&s;ubtile part of the Blood, and ought
not to be forc'd away without ma|nifect
nece&s;&s;ity. The Matter of in|&s;en&s;ible
<PB N="132" REF="162">
Per&s;piration is mild, that of
Sweat re&s;embles Urine, and yields a
Volatile Salt, oily and fetid. When
Sweat is vehement it will grow Bloody.
The Matter of Sweat is the watery
part of our Drink impregnated with
this Salt, &s;ometimes in weak and
con&s;umptive People, Crude, Chyle,
and &s;ometimes (as was &s;aid before)
the mo&s;t elaborate &s;ubtile part of
our Blood, as in fat People who
have a &s;mall in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration.</P>
<P>32. Sweat is produc'd by chang|ing
the balance between the Fluids
and Solids (in which it mu&s;t be
confe&s;t that true Health con&s;i&s;ts) &s;o
as the projectile Motion of the
Fluids overcome the Re&s;i&s;tance of
the Solids; therefore it is produc'd
by relaxing the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Skin.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> By diluting. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By
di&s;&s;olving the Blood. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> By
accelerating its Motion. Water dilutes
and relaxes at the &s;ame time, therefore
the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t Sudorifick, watery
<PB N="133" REF="163">
and Acid things mix'd prove &s;trong
Sudorificks; Spices by Heating, and
di&s;&s;olving the Blood are not &s;o pro|per
and &s;afe Sudorificks.</P>
<P>33. In&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration is the
la&s;t and mod perfect Action of A|nimal
Dige&s;tion; the keeping it up
in due mea&s;ure, is the cau&s;e as well
as &s;ign of Health, and the lea&s;t
Deviation from that due Quantity,
the certain forerunner of a Di&s;ea&s;e,
therefore the be&s;t Indications for Diet
are taken from the Mea&s;ure of Per|&s;piration.</P>
<P>The Food which is mo&s;t Vapo|ri&s;h
and Per&s;pirable is certainly the
mo&s;t ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, but &s;uch may
be proper or improper, for the A|nimal
according to its Circum&s;tances,
e&s;pecially the Quantity of its Mu&s;|cular
Motion. By Prop. IV. Chap. II.
The &s;trength of the Aliment mu&s;t
be proportion'd to the action of the
Solids upon it, which in an Animal
under a cour&s;e of exerci&s;e or hard
<PB N="134" REF="164">
labour is much &s;tronger; therefore
Aliment too Vaporo&s;e or Per&s;pira|ble,
will &s;ubject it to the inconve|niences
of too &s;trong a Per&s;piration,
which are Debility, Faintings, and
&s;ometimes &s;udden Death. What di|mini&s;heth
Sweating, or the &s;en&s;ible
Per&s;piration increa&s;eth the in&s;en&s;ible,
for that rea&s;on a Strengthning and
A&s;tringent Diet often conduceth to
this purpo&s;e. According to the Ex|periments
of <HI>Sanctorius</HI> the mo&s;t
nouri&s;hing Aliment is the lea&s;t per|&s;pirable
except Mutton, which of
all others is mo&s;t &s;o, and Hog's
Fle&s;h the lea&s;t; and for the &s;ame rea|&s;on
Eels, and all very fat and oily
Sub&s;tances: copious Food of &s;mall
Nouri&s;hment per&s;pires much.</P>
<P>A Stomach too void or too full
&s;tops Per&s;piration. The Fruits of the
low Pomiferous Plants as Cucum|bers,
Melons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;top Per&s;pira|tion,
therefore they are wi&s;ely provi|ded
by Nature in a Sea&s;on when the
<PB N="135" REF="165">
Per&s;piration is too great. Variety of
Meats dimini&s;h Per&s;piration, Honey
in cold Con&s;titutions increa&s;eth Per|&s;piration,
except when it promotes
too great a Secretion of the Bile,
and then it dimini&s;heth it: Drinking
exce&s;&s;ively during the time of Chy|lification,
&s;tops Per&s;piration. Let
tho&s;e who &s;it long at their Bottle af|ter
Meals con&s;ider this.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;ure &s;ign of a deficient
Per&s;piration is Flatulency or Wind.</P>
<P>34. The Men&s;es are promoted.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By every thing which occa&s;i|ons
a Plethora, &s;uch are all Aliments
of ea&s;y Dige&s;tion, taken in &s;ufficient
Quantity. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By all Sapona|ceous
Sub&s;tances, which incide the
Mucus in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages. <HI>Thirdly,</HI>
By Spices and warm Vegetables
which abound with a Volatile oily
Salt. Of the&s;e we have &s;poken be|fore.</P>
<P>35. Heat in Animal Bodies is
produc'd by the Attrition of the Fluids
<PB N="136" REF="166">
and Solids, for when that cea&s;eth as
in Death, there is extremity of Cold,
The &s;olid parts of Animals rubbing
again&s;t one another would in time
produce a Heat capable to de&s;troy
the Parts, had not Nature provided
an oily Sub&s;tance to lubricate and
moi&s;ten them; when that fails as
happens &s;ometimes in the Scurvy,
Gout, and Rheumati&s;m, an Inflam|matory
Heat is often produc'd.</P>
<P>36. Stimulating Sub&s;tances taken
in Diet increa&s;e Heat, becau&s;e they
increa&s;e the O&s;cillatory Motion of
the Solids, but mo&s;t of all In|flammatory
Spirits. Whatever in|crea&s;eth
the Den&s;ity of the Blood,
even without increa&s;ing its Celerity,
heats, becau&s;e a den&s;er Body is hot|ter
than a rarer. Extreme Cold at la&s;t
heats. Cold in Animal Bodies is
produc'd by Cau&s;es contrary to tho&s;e
productive of Heat, as <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> by di|mini&s;hing
the force of any Stimulus,
as by Whey, Milk, Water, <HI>&amp;c.
<PB N="137" REF="167">
Secondly,</HI> By all Things which relax.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Alkaline Sub&s;tances in re|&s;pect
of Acid, and Acid in re&s;pect
of Alkaline are cooling.</P>
<P>37. Cephalick are all &s;uch Things
as attenuate the Blood &s;o as to make
it circulate ea&s;ily through the capil|lary
Ve&s;&s;els of the Brain. A Cor|dial
properly &s;peaking is not always
what increa&s;eth the Force of the
Heart; for by increa&s;ing that the
Animal may be weaken'd as in in|flammatory
Di&s;ea&s;es. Whatever in|crea&s;eth
the Natural or Animal
Strength, the Force of moving the
Fluids and the Mu&s;cles is a Cordial,
&s;uch are &s;uch Sub&s;tances, as bring
the Serum of the Blood into the
propere&s;t Condition for Circulation
and Nutrition, as Broths made of
Animal Sub&s;tances, Milk, ripe Fruits,
and whatever is endued with a
whole&s;ome but not pungent Ta&s;te.
Whatever relaxes the too &s;trict, or
&s;trengthens the too lax Fibres, what
<PB N="138" REF="168">
in &s;ome Ca&s;es di&s;pels Wind, what
excites and takes off the &s;luggi&s;h Mo|tion
of the Animal Spirits, as Spi|ces,
Wine, and &s;pirituous Liquors.</P>
<P>38. Carminative are &s;uch Things
as dilute and relax at the &s;ame time,
becau&s;e Wind occa&s;ions a Spa&s;m or
Convul&s;ion in &s;ome Part; whatever
promotes in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration is
Carminative, for Wind is per&s;pirable
Matter retain'd in the Body.</P>
<P>39. All emollient relaxing Diet,
and all things which de&s;troy Acrimo|ny,
abate Pain.</P>
<P>40. There are &s;everal Things ta|ken
in Diet which kill Worms, as
Oil, and Honey.</P>
<P>Whoever attends to the Particu|lars
barely hinted at in this Chapter,
will ea&s;ily perceive that all the In|tentions
pur&s;ued by Medicines, may
be obtain'd and inforc'd by Diet.</P>
<P>It may be expected that I &s;hould
&s;ay &s;omething in this Chapter of the
Qualities of three exotick Plants,
<PB N="139" REF="169">
who&s;e Infu&s;ions and Decoctions are
now much us'd in common Aliment,
Tea, Coffee and Chocolate: There
are many Treati&s;es wrote about them,
which a&s;cribe to them both good
and bad Qualities, which they have
not. There is lately publi&s;hed a ve|ry
learned and elaborate Di&s;&s;ertation
upon Tea, by Doctor <HI>Thomas Short,</HI>
in which the Author with great
Knowledge, Indu&s;try, and Skill, has
not only given us the natural Hi&s;to|ry
of the Plant, but likewi&s;e its A|naly&s;is.</P>
<P>But as the Infu&s;ions and Decocti|ons
of the foremention'd Vegetables
in common Water, are the only Pre|parations
of them in U&s;e, there is no
nece&s;&s;ity in this Place of con&s;idering
any of their Contents, but &s;uch as
are extracted by tho&s;e &s;imple Opera|tions
of Cookery.</P>
<P>The green Leaves of Tea contain
a narcotick Juice, which exudes by
Roa&s;ting. This is perform'd with
<PB N="140" REF="170">
great Care before it is expos'd to &s;ale.
The &s;everal Methods of di&s;covering
the Adulterations of Tea by Coppe|ras,
Galls, Spirit of Harts-horn, one
may &s;ee in the foremention'd Trea|ti&s;e.
Tea by its manner of affecting
the Organs of Ta&s;te and Smell, con|tains
very little of a volatile Spirit;
its Ro&s;in or fix'd Oil which is bit|ter
and a&s;tringent, cannot be ex|tracted
by Water, but demands recti|fy'd
Spirit. The active Principles of
it extracted by Infu&s;ion, are the mo&s;t
&s;eparable Parts of its Oil or Gum,
and its Salt.</P>
<P>Its Salt and Gum are a&s;tringent;
chalybeat Water draws from it a
Tincture of the &s;ame Colour as that
from Oak-leaves. It is ace&s;cent as
appears by its Effects upon Stomachs
troubled with Acidity. So that Tea
is an Infu&s;ion of a Plant ace&s;cent,
and moderately a&s;tringent in warm
Water.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="171">
As a watery Liquor, it is diluting
and &s;timulating by its Salt: By its
a&s;tringent Quality it moderates the
relaxing Quality of warm Water.
By what has been &s;aid before in this
Chapter, Water endu'd with any &s;a|line
&s;timulating Sub&s;tance is very pe|netrating,
and goes into the mo&s;t
inward Rece&s;&s;es of the circulating
Juices by its Quality, and re|fre&s;heth
the Brain and Animal Spi|rits;
but by its &s;typtick and &s;timu|lating
Quality it affects the Nerves,
very often occa&s;ioning Tremors, by
its Heat it promotes Per&s;piration, by
its watery Quality it di&s;&s;olves what
is vi&s;cid in the Stomach, and &s;o
ay help Dige&s;tion; but a &s;trong
Decoction of it is emetick, and
drinking too great Quantities may
relax and weaken the Tone of the
Stomach.</P>
<P>As &s;timulating and diluting it is
diuretick, but as it is a&s;tringent, it
is not quite &s;o proper where relax|ing
<PB N="142" REF="172">
the urinary Pa&s;&s;ages is nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>Milk abates &s;ome of the foremen|tion'd
Qualities, making it more &s;oft
and nutritious, and Sugar as a Salt
increa&s;eth its <HI>Stimulus.</HI> From tho&s;e
Hints it follows, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That Tea is
proper only for &s;uch who&s;e Bodies
are in &s;uch a State as demands &s;ome
of the foremention'd Alterations.
Who the&s;e are, will be &s;hown more
plainly in the following Chapter. <HI>Se|condly,</HI>
That the immoderate Strength
and Quantity of this Liquor may be
hurtful in many Ca&s;es, and to mo&s;t
People.</P>
<P>Coffee has in common with all
Nuts an Oil &s;trongly combin'd, and
entangled with earthy Particles.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t noxious Part of its Oil
exhales in roa&s;ting to the Abatement
of near 1/4 of its Weight.</P>

<P>What is extracted by Water from
Coffee, is the mo&s;t &s;eparable Parts of
Oil which often &s;wims a-top of the

and con&s;equently very little Nutri|tious.</P>
<P>Volatile Oils refre&s;h the Animal
Spirits, but likewi&s;e are endued with
all the bad Qualities of &s;uch Sub|&s;tances,
producing all the Effects of
an oily and aromatical Acrimony
mention'd in the following Chapter,
as Dryne&s;s, Heat, Stimulation, Tre|mors
of the Nerves, from whence it
has been accus'd of cau&s;ing Pal&s;ies,
Leanne&s;s, Watchfulne&s;s, and de&s;troy|ing
ma&s;culine Vigour.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="174">
From the&s;e Qualities it is ea&s;y to
imagine that it mu&s;t be hurtful to
hot, dry, bilious Con&s;titutions, and
perhaps beneficial to Phlegmatick,
and that drank in too great a Degree
of Strength or Quantity hurtful to
every Body.</P>
<P>Chocolate is certainly much the
be&s;t of tho&s;e three exotick Liquors,
its Oil &s;eems to be both rich, ali|mentary,
and anodyne; for an Oil
as &s;oft as that of &s;weet Almonds can
be extracted from the Nut, and the
<HI>Indians</HI> made Bread of it. This Oil
combin'd with its own Salt and Su|gar,
makes it &s;aponaceous and de|tergent,
by which Quality it often
helps Dige&s;tion and excites Appetite,
when it is mix'd with Vanillios or
Spices; it acquires likewi&s;e the good
and bad Qualities of aromatick Oils,
which are proper in &s;ome Ca&s;es and

<P>To enumerate the mo&s;t common

<P>The mo&s;t common Diver&s;ities of
Human Con&s;titutions ari&s;e either
from the &s;olid Parts as to their dif|ferent
Degrees of Strength and Ten|&s;ion;
in &s;ome being too lax and
weak, in others too ela&s;tick and
&s;trong; or from the different State
of the Fluids, which, as they con&s;i&s;t
of Spirit, Water, Salts, Oil and ter|re&s;trial
Parts, differ according to the
Redundance of the whole, or of a|ny
of the&s;e Ingredients, and there|fore
are plethorick, phlegmatick, oily

Di&s;&s;ipation of the mo&s;t fluid Parts,
which la&s;t Con&s;titution is call'd, by
the Antients, Atrabilarian or Melan|cholick.
A plethorick Con&s;titution
in which true Blood abounds, is

call'd Sanguineous. A &s;aline Con&s;titu|tion

according to the Difference

<P>2. In &s;ome of the&s;e Sen&s;es, tho'
every Human Con&s;titution is mor|bid,
yet are their Di&s;ea&s;es con&s;i&s;tent
with the common Functions of Life,

<P>3. I think it proper to adverti&s;e

That I endeavour to give the mo&s;t

<HEAD>PROP. II.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Cau&s;es, Symptoms
and proper Diet of &s;uch as have
weak and lax Fibres.</P>
<P>1. In all the Fibres of an Animal
Body, and in the Sides of all the
Canals, there is a contractile Power
whereby the Fibres endeavour to
&s;horten them&s;elves. This is evident;
for if a Fibre be cut tran&s;ver&s;ly, both
the Ends &s;hrink, and make the
Wound gape; the Force oppos'd to
this contractile Power of the Fibres,
is the influent Liquid. Health con|&s;i&s;ts
in the <HI>Equilibrium</HI> between tho&s;e
two Powers, when the Fluids move
&s;o equally, that they don't pre&s;s up|on
the Solids with a greater Force
than they can bear, and no more in
one Part than in another; and on
<PB N="149" REF="179">
the other hand when the Solids re|&s;i&s;t,
and act upon the Fluids &s;o e|qually
that there is no unea&s;y Sen&s;a|tion,
the Animal is in Health; on
the contrary when ever this <HI>Equili|brium</HI>
between the influent Fluids and
Solids is taken away the Animal is
in a morbid State; and whatever
de&s;troys it in any Point, de&s;troys it
in &s;ome mea&s;ure through the whole
Body.</P>
<P>2. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple So|lids
of our Body are perhaps merely
terre&s;trial, incapable of any Change
or Di&s;ea&s;e; of the&s;e Elements are
con&s;tituted the &s;malle&s;t Fibres, of
tho&s;e Fibres the Ve&s;&s;els, of tho&s;e Ve&s;|&s;els
the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> or Organs of the Bo|dy;
therefore the Weakne&s;s and La|xity
of the Fibres, Ve&s;&s;els, Vi&s;cera,
and all Parts of the Body may be
con&s;idered as one Di&s;ea&s;e, tho' it
mu&s;t be own'd that the Di&s;ea&s;e is
not always univer&s;al, and there will
be &s;ometimes a Weakne&s;s in &s;ome
<PB N="150" REF="180">
Organ with a great Degree of mu&s;|cular
Strength.</P>
<P>3. A Fibre is &s;aid to be weak
when the Cohe&s;ion of its Parts is &s;o
&s;mall that it may be broken, or re|&s;olved
by a Force not much greater
than what happens commonly in the
Body of a healthy Per&s;on: Debility
of the Ve&s;&s;els or Organs is &s;o &s;mall
a Cohe&s;ion of the con&s;tituent Parts
as makes them unable to di&s;charge
the common Functions of Life, con|&s;ider'd
in a State of Health. Tho'
there is a Debility of Fibres in In|fants
ab&s;olutely &s;peaking, yet it is
no Di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e their Fibres be|ing
lax, lengthen by the Influx of
the Liquids which is the Cau&s;e of
their Growth; but in adult Per&s;ons,
when the Fibres cannot any more
yield, they mu&s;t either break or lo&s;e
their Spring.</P>
<P>4. Laxity of a Fibre is &s;uch a
&s;mall Cohe&s;ion of its Parts, as &s;uf|fers
it to be lengthen'd by a &s;mall
<PB N="151" REF="181">
Force: Laxity is a Species of Debi|lity.</P>
<P>5. The mo&s;t common Cau&s;es of
Debility of Fibres are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A De|fect
or great Lo&s;s of the vital nutri|tious
Juices: If there is not Blood
enough the Chyle cannot be ea&s;ily
a&s;&s;imilated. A Per&s;on who lo&s;eth
daily great Quantities of Blood turns
Drop&s;ical and Leucophlegmatick.
An ela&s;tick Fibre like a Bow, the
more it is extended, re&s;tores it&s;elf
with the greater Force; if the Spring
be de&s;troy'd, it is like a Bag only
pa&s;&s;ive as to the Influx of the Li|quid.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Nouri&s;hment too
vi&s;cid and glutinous to be &s;ubdu'd
by the vital Force; of this Sort <HI>Hip|pocrates</HI>
reckoned unfermented Bread.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> A &s;edentary Life, for Mo|tion
increa&s;eth the Circulation of the
Juices, and con&s;equently the Appli|cation
of the &s;olid Parts to one an|other.
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> Too great an Ex|tention
of the Fibres by Plenitude;
<PB N="152" REF="182">
a Lute-&s;tring will bear a hundred
Weight without Rupture; but at
the &s;ame time cannot exert its Ela&s;ti|city,
take away fifty, and imme|diately
it rai&s;eth the Weight. <HI>Fifth|ly,</HI>
A moi&s;t Atmo&s;phere. The At|mo&s;phere
is what keeps the Fibres
of an Animal Body together, we
feel our Fibres grow &s;trict or lax ac|cording
to the State of the Air; ma|ny
who live healthy in a dry Air, fall
into all the Di&s;ea&s;es that depend up|on
Relaxation in a moi&s;t one. <HI>La&s;t|ly,</HI>
A natural Weakne&s;s from the
Frame and Con&s;titution of the Body.</P>
<P>6. The common Signs and Ef|fects
of weak Fibres are Palene&s;s,
Smoothne&s;s, Coldne&s;s of the Skin,
Colour of the Blood not Florid (for
what maketh that is a &s;trong action
of the Solids) a weak Pul&s;e, Tume|factions
in the whole Body or Parts,
Stagnation of Humours, and its
con&s;equence Putrefactions; for when
the force of the Ve&s;&s;els and Pre&s;&s;ure
<PB N="153" REF="183">
of the Air is taken off, all the Hu|mours
expand them&s;elves, and what
&s;tagnates mu&s;t putrify; if a Per&s;on
of a firm Con&s;titution begins to
bloat, and from being warm grows
cold, his Fibres grow weak. Anxiety
and Palpitations of the Heart are a
&s;ign of weak Fibres: Acid Eructati|ons
upon taking Vegetable Food, or
Nidoro&s;e upon taking Animal is a
&s;ign of weak Organs of Dige&s;tion.
Depravation of the Humours from a
&s;ound State, to what the Phy&s;icians
call by the general Name of a Caco|chymy,
Spots and Di&s;colorations of
the Skin are &s;igns of weak Fibres;
for the lateral Ve&s;&s;els which lie out
of the Road of Circulation, let gro&s;s
Humours pa&s;s, which could not if the
Ve&s;&s;els had their due Degree of
&s;tricture. Atrophy as denoting a De|&s;truction
or Ob&s;truction of the Ve&s;|&s;els,
which carry the Nouri&s;hment,
and Drop&s;ies proceed from a Laxity
of the Fibres being too weak to re|turn
the Fluid.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="184">
7. It is evident that the Aliment
of Per&s;ons with weak Fibres, ought
to be &s;uch as requires but a &s;mall
force to convert it into Animal Sub|&s;tances,
&s;uch is that mention'd
Chap. V. Prop. IV. V. Milk is the
Chylous part of an Animal already
prepar'd, the Chee&s;y part is &s;epara|ted
and di&s;&s;olv'd by the Bile, and the
more Serous and Spiritous Part en|ters
into the Blood, meer Whey is
too relaxing, Eggs taken warm from
the Hen; for the mo&s;t elaborate and
&s;piritous Part is lo&s;t in the dre&s;&s;ing
Broths made of Fle&s;h, which are
the Nutritious Animal Juices &s;eparated
from the &s;olid Parts. The Alkale&s;|cent
Quality of them may be corre|cted,
if nece&s;&s;ary, by mixing them with
&s;ome Acid. Decoctions, and Creams,
or Jellies of well fermented Bread, (for
Fermentation as was hinted Chap. III.
Prop. IV. de&s;troys the glutinous
oily Vi&s;cidity with which mealy Sub|&s;tances
abound) au&s;tere Wines di|luted
<PB N="155" REF="185">
with Water, which cool more
than Water alone, and at the &s;ame
time do not relax, Vegetables with
an acid au&s;tere Juice mention'd
Chap V. Prop. IV. VIII. are all pro|per
in this Ca&s;e. Relaxation from Ple|nitude
is cur'd by &s;pare Diet, and from
any Cau&s;e by that which is contrary to
it. Care mu&s;t be taken in contracting
the Fibres, not to ob&s;truct the Ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. III.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Symptoms, Cau&s;es,
and proper Diet of &s;uch as have too
&s;trong and too ela&s;tick Fibres.</P>
<P>1. A State oppo&s;ite to the former
is too great Rigidity and Ela&s;ticity
of the Fibres, which is &s;uch a Degree
of Cohe&s;ion as makes them inflexible
to the Cau&s;es, to which they ought
to yield, &s;o as to pre&s;erve the Ani|mal
in Health: Too great Ela&s;ticity
is that Quality by which they not
only re&s;i&s;t again&s;t Elongation, but
<PB N="156" REF="186">
re&s;tore them&s;elves with too great
Pre&s;&s;ure and Force upon the moving
Fluid.</P>
<P>Rigidity of the Organs is &s;uch a
State as makes them re&s;i&s;t that Ex|pan&s;ion,
which is nece&s;&s;ary to carry
on the Vital Functions. Rigidity of
the Ve&s;&s;els and Organs mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
follow from Rigidity of the
Fibres, both as the Fibres are their
con&s;tituent Parts, and likewi&s;e be|cau&s;e
by the &s;trong Force of the
Heart and Motion of the Fluids,
many of the Solids are compacted into
one, and the Canals, through which
they flow'd, aboli&s;h'd as by Prop. VII.
Chap. II.</P>
<P>2. True Health con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch a
Flexibility of Fibres as yield to the
Force of the Heart, &s;o as to admit
the influent Fluid, and then &s;uch a
due Spring to re&s;tore them&s;elves &s;o
as to drive it forward; for if the Ca|nals
were entirely rigid, or the Force
of the Fibres in re&s;toring them&s;elves
<PB N="157" REF="187">
were either in Equilibrium with, or
exceeding that of the Heart, there
could be no Circulation, even if the
Ve&s;&s;els drive back the Blood with
too great a Force upon the Heart,
it will produce Polypo&s;e Concreti|ons
in the Ventricles of the Heart,
e&s;pecially when the Valves of the
Heart are apt them&s;elves to grow too
rigid, if but one Drop of Blood re|main
in the Heart at every Pul&s;e;
tho&s;e in many Pul&s;es will grow to a
con&s;iderable Ma&s;s.</P>
<P>3. It is ea&s;y by the Laws of Hy|draulicks
to determine the natural
Effects of &s;uch a Con&s;titution, which
is the Parent of acute Di&s;ea&s;es, as
Laxity of Chronical.</P>
<P>4. The Cau&s;e of &s;uch a Di&s;ea&s;e
be&s;ides the Natural Con&s;titution
and Frame of the Body is too long
a Continuance of &s;uch Diet as
&s;trengthens the Fibres, hard Exerci&s;e
or Labour, &s;uch as u&s;e it, according
to <HI>Hippocrates</HI> are not ea&s;ily cur'd of
<PB N="158" REF="188">
Pleuri&s;ies; &s;uch a Con&s;titution is
ea&s;ily known by the outward ap|pearances
of the Body being lean,
warm, hairy, &s;craggy, dry without a
Di&s;ea&s;e, with hard and firm Mu&s;cles,
for the great Force by which the
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els re&s;tore them&s;elves, makes
them grow narrow, expelling the
Liquor they contain, and &s;carce ad|mitting
what is influent by which
the Ve&s;&s;els grow hard and contract|ed;
la&s;tly by the Strength of the
Pul&s;e, and the Force of the vital
Actions.</P>
<P>5. The Rules of Diet for &s;uch a
Con&s;titution may be drawn from
Prop. IV. of the foregoing Chapter.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Ab&s;tinence from things us'd
in the contrary State of too great
Laxity. Milk is too nouri&s;hing, but
Whey proper as an Emollient. Au|&s;tere
and &s;trong Wines are improper
but much more &s;o are inflammable
Spirits which harden the Fibres; Wa|ter
is the proper Drink being &s;trongly
<PB N="159" REF="189">
relaxing, there is no better way of
&s;uppling a Carca&s;s then by drenching
it in Water. All Emollient Nouri&s;h|ment,
&s;uch as Fruits which contain a
Mucilage, and may be boil'd into Jel|lies.
Pot Herbs of the Emollient kind,
&s;uch things as re&s;olve and clean&s;e,
that is take away any tenacious So|lid
which adheres to the Fibres, &s;uch
are Vegetable Soaps, the chief of
which is Honey. The Animal Food
&s;hould be prepar'd in Broths rather
than in any other form, all things
which increa&s;e Fat, all oily Sub&s;tan|ces.
The Animal Oils, Cream, But|ter,
Marrow, farinaceous Sub&s;tances
unfermented, as little Salt in the A|liment
as po&s;&s;ible, for Salt hardens.</P>
<P>6. From tho&s;e two Cau&s;es of the
Laxity and Rigidity of the Fibres,
the Methodi&s;ts an ancient Set of
Phy&s;icians deriv'd all Di&s;ea&s;es of hu|man
Bodies with a great deal of
Rea&s;on, for the Fluids derive their
Qualities from the Solids. There
<PB N="160" REF="190">
&s;eems hardly any other Account to

am of Opinion, that in mo&s;t ca&s;es
where the Juices are in a morbid

<P>1. A &s;anguineous Con&s;titution (in
the common Acceptation of the

with Blood is different from a Ple|thorick;
the common outward Sign
of &s;uch a Con&s;titution is a florid
Appearance in the Countenance, a
Bluene&s;s and Fullne&s;s of the Veins,
Softne&s;s of the Fle&s;h, a particular
vivid, fair, but not pale Colour of
the Skin, &s;uch a Con&s;titution with
a great Appearance of Health is &s;ub|ject
to many Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="193">
2. The Blood as was ob&s;erved,
Prop. V. Chap. II. con&s;i&s;ts of red
Globules &s;wimming in a thin Li|quor
call'd Serum, the red part is
&s;malle&s;t in quantity. The red Glo|bules
are Ela&s;tick, and will break,
one red Globule into &s;ix &s;mall, and
then they will turn yellow, tho&s;e
yellow Globules break into o|thers
&s;till &s;maller, and then they
grow more white and tran&s;parent; the
Ve&s;&s;els, which admit the &s;maller Glo|bules,
cannot admit the greater with|out

pa&s;&s;eth through narrower Channels,
the Redne&s;s di&s;appears more and more.
All the Chyle is white, and acquires
this red Colour by Circulation. A
free and &s;trong Projectile Motion of
the Blood mu&s;t occa&s;ion a florid Ap|pearance

Con&s;titutions, becau&s;e a &s;tronger

Per&s;ons is plain, from their
great Veins appearing blue and tran&s;|parent

Action or Reaction of the Fluids and

to which Heat is proportional: This
great Attrition mu&s;t produce a great

<P>If the Ve&s;&s;els are in a &s;tate of too

of an erroneous Circulation, (that is,
when the Blood &s;trays into the Ve&s;&s;els
de&s;tin'd to carry Serum or Lymph,
according to Prop. V. Chap. II.)
From whence will follow Ob&s;tructions
and Inflammations, and as the Thin|ne&s;s

reigns through the whole Sy&s;|tem,
it mu&s;t affect the Glands and

<P>To explain the Symptoms, Cau|&s;es,
and proper Diet of Acid Con|&s;titutions.</P>
<P>1. It has been demon&s;trated b|fore,
that the Juices of a &s;ound Ani|mal,
are neither Acid nor Alkaline,
by the Experiments mention'd
Chapter IV. All the Sub&s;tances
Fluid, and Solid, of an Animal fed,
even with ace&s;cent Sub&s;tances, yield
by fire, nothing but Alkaline Salts.
Tho&s;e Experiments which endeavour
to &s;hew the contrary, have been made
upon Animals, which had taken
much Sea-Salt, which is never totally
changed in an Animal Body. The
ingenious and learned <HI>Boerhaave</HI> fed
a Sparrow with Bread four Days, in
which time it eat more than its own
weight, and yet there was no Acid
found in its Body or Excrements.
The rea&s;on of this is, that the vital
<PB N="168" REF="198">
Force of a &s;ound Animal is capable
to tran&s;mute the Acid Sub&s;tances it
takes in Aliment, into &s;oft nutritious
animal Liquids by its vital Force (by
which is under&s;tood the &s;umm of all
tho&s;e Powers in an Animal Body,
which converts its Aliment into
Fluids of its own Nature) a Cow
fed with Trefoil, Dai&s;ies, Sorrel,
gives Milk, in which there is not
the lea&s;t Acidity; but if this vital
Force is weak, it is in&s;ufficient to &s;ub|due
the Acidity of the Sub&s;tances
taken by the Mouth. The Liquors,
which are made of fermented Plants,
as Wine and Malt Liquors &s;tanding
in a Heat not greater than that of
a human Body, turn &s;our; and &s;o
they will in a human Body that has
not &s;ufficient vital Force to change
them, which makes no more Alteration
in &s;uch Sub&s;tances, than a Ve&s;&s;el
with the &s;ame degree of Heat and
Moi&s;ture. Thus weak Stomachs vo|mit
up the Wine that they drink in
<PB N="169" REF="199">
too great Quantities to be dige&s;ted,
in me form of Vinegar. Put Bread
into the Stomach of a dying Man,
and it will follow its own Nature,
and undergo the Alteration that is
merely the Effect of Heat. A weak
Stomach will turn Rye-Bread into
Vinegar, and a Plough-Man will
dige&s;t it. Mealy Sub&s;tances ferment|ed
turn &s;our, and unfermented be|ing
mix'd with a &s;mall Quantity of
Water they turn vi&s;cid, and then
hard like Stones: accordingly given
to a weak Child they &s;till retain
their Nature; for Bread will give
him the Cholick, and unfermented
farinaceous Sub&s;tances will fill his
Belly with a vi&s;cous Humour.</P>
<P>2. As no Acid is naturally in an
Animal Body, but mu&s;t be taken in
by the Mouth; &s;o if it is not &s;ub|du'd
in the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Chyle,
it may get into the Blood; and if
there is not a &s;ufficient Quantity of
Blood, and Strength of Circulation
<PB N="170" REF="200">
to &s;ubdue it, it may infect the
whole Ma&s;s of the Fluids; but this
is a morbid State. The Experi|ments
made upon Chyle have never
di&s;cover'd any Acidity in it; but the
Subject of the&s;e Experiments has
been always the Chyle of healthy
Animals.</P>
<P>3. The fir&s;t and principal Seat of
Acidity is the Stomach; this Quali|ty
of the Chyle is in &s;ome mea&s;ure
taken off in the <HI>Duodenum,</HI> and by the
Mixture of Bile with it, grows le&s;s in
the other Parts of the alimentary
Duct, and &s;till le&s;s in the Thoracick
Duct, becau&s;e great Quantities of
Animal Liquors have been mix'd with
it; but at la&s;t it may (as was &s;aid
before) infect the Blood: Thus it is
found by Experience, that the Sweat
is &s;ometimes acid, which is a Sign
of Recovery after acute Di&s;tempers,
where the Blood was in the contra|ry
alkale&s;cent Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

4. The Antecedent Concomitants
and Effects of &s;uch a Con&s;titution,
are Acids taken in too great Quan|tities:
Sour Eructations, a craving Ap|petite,
e&s;pecially of terre&s;trial and ab|&s;orbent
Sub&s;tances, the Ca&s;e of Girls
in the Green Sickne&s;s, Sourne&s;s in
the Stomach, Pain in the Stomach
(which tho' &s;ometimes occa&s;ion'd by
an acrid Bile, this Cau&s;e may be
di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Ab&s;ence of other
Symptoms) Colical Pains about the
Navel, the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> dry Gripes are
perhaps occa&s;ion'd by the too great
Quantities of Acids, as Lime-juice in
Punch. The Colicks of Infants
proceed from Acidity, and the Air
in the Aliment expanding it&s;elf while
the Aliment ferments; for Oil of Vi|triol
will throw the Stomach into
involuntary Contractions, Inactivity
and Change of Colour in the Bile;
for Acids change the Colour and
Con&s;i&s;tence of it. Bile is the chief
In&s;trument of Dige&s;tion, and as was
<PB N="172" REF="202">
&s;aid before, <HI>Prop.</HI> V. <HI>Chap.</HI> I. can
attenuate the chee&s;y Sub&s;tance in the
Stomach of a Calf, and render it
fluid; hence bilious Con&s;titutions ea|&s;ily
dige&s;t Chee&s;e, a &s;our Smell of
the Faeces (when the Bile is redun|dant,
they &s;mell cadaverous) acid
Sweats, Palene&s;s of the Skin; for as
was ob&s;erv'd before, taking much
Vinegar will make the Lips pale. It
is po&s;&s;ible that Tumors in the Brea&s;ts
may be the Effect of Acidity in the
Milk, and Convul&s;ions in Infants
may be occa&s;ion'd from Acidity pa&s;|&s;ing
into the Blood, and affecting
the tender Fibres of the Brain. Some
Sorts of cutaneous Eruptions are oc|ca&s;ion'd
by feeding much on acid
unripe Fruits, and farinaceous Sub|&s;tances.</P>
<P>5. Acidity, as it is not the natu|ral
State of the Animal Fluids, but
induc'd by Aliment, is to be cur'd
by Aliment, with the contrary Qua|lities;
for which the Reader is re|ferr'd
<PB N="173" REF="203">
to the foregoing Chapter. An|ti-acid
Medicines are ineffectual with|out
a Diet of the &s;ame Kind; all
Animal Diet is Alkale&s;cent, e&s;pecial|ly
of &s;uch as feed upon other Ani|mals,
as Infects, Fi&s;h; and e&s;pecially
Shell-Fi&s;h. Acidity in the Infant
may be cur'd by a Fle&s;h-Diet; in
the Nur&s;e. There are a great many
anti-acid Vegetables which do not
ea&s;ily ferment, but putrify, as all the
warm Anti-&s;corbuticks: Selery, A&s;|paragus,
Cabbage, Turnips, Carrots,
Onions, Leeks, Radi&s;hes, Mu&s;tard,
Eringo-Roots and Nettles, are An|ti-acid.
In Ca&s;es of Acidity, Water is
the proper Drink, its Quality of re|laxing
too much may be corrected
by boiling it with &s;ome Animal Sub|&s;tances,
as Ivory, Harts-horn: Ab&s;ti|nence
from fermented Liquors is ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>6. This Di&s;temper is mo&s;t inci|dent

<P>To explain the Symptoms, Cau|&s;es,
and proper Diet of Con&s;tituti|ons,
which abound with a &s;pontane|ous
Alkali.</P>
<P>1. A Con&s;titution oppo&s;ite to the
former is that which abounds with a
&s;pontaneous Alkali. No Animal un|putrify'd
being burnt, yields any al|kaline
Salt, but putrify'd yields a
volatile Alkali, therefore in a healthy
Animal no true Alkali is found; but
as an Animal degenerates from this
State, by &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es as increa&s;e
the Attrition and Heat of the Fluids,
the Animal Salts formerly benign
approach towards an alkaline Nature,
<PB N="175" REF="205">
Human Blood, when it is fir&s;t let, is
mild, and will not make the Eye or
a fre&s;h Wound &s;mart. Let it &s;tand
in a Degree of Heat equal to that of
a Human Body, it will grow in three
Days, fetid, the Salt of it volatile and
alkaline fermenting with Acids, the
Oil that remains volatile and rancid;
the Blood in the Ve&s;&s;els may at la&s;t
arrive at the &s;ame State, but mu&s;t
pa&s;s thro' infinite Degrees, and be|fore
it comes to the la&s;t, the Ani|mal
will be de&s;troyed. All Animal
Sub&s;tances expos'd to the Air turn
Alkaline of their own accord, and
&s;ome Vegetables by Heat will not
turn acid but alkaline: Every Plant in
that State of Putrefaction by <HI>Prop.</HI>
III. <HI>Chap.</HI> I. is converted as it were
into an Animal Sub&s;tance, by Chy|mical
Trials yielding the &s;ame Con|tents.</P>
<P>2. The Cau&s;es of &s;uch a Di&s;tem|per,
is a Diet of alkale&s;cent Sub&s;tan|ces.
If a Woman &s;hould live upon
<PB N="176" REF="206">
Vegetables, Bread, and fermented
Liquors, her Milk would be ace&s;cent
or ready to turn &s;our; if only on
Animal Food her Milk would be
apt to turn fetid and putrid, but not
&s;our.</P>
<P>If it was po&s;&s;ible to take Mu&s;tard
in great Quantities, it would quick|ly
bring the Blood into this alkaline
State, and de&s;troy the Animal; the
warm anti&s;corbutical Plants taken in
Quantities will occa&s;ion &s;tinking
Breath, and corrupt the Blood. All
Animals that live upon other Ani|mals
have their Juices more alkale&s;|cent,
than &s;uch as live upon Vegeta|bles,
and for that Rea&s;on perhaps
Fi&s;hes have this Quality more than
terre&s;trial Animals; for in the open
Air they putrify &s;ooner, by what
was &s;aid <HI>Prop.</HI> I. <HI>Chap.</HI> IV. An Ani|mal
with a &s;trong vital Force of Di|ge&s;tion
will turn Acids into Animal
Sub&s;tances; but if its Food be in|tirely
alkale&s;cent, its Juices will be
<PB N="177" REF="207">
more &s;o. No Per&s;on is able to &s;up|port
a Diet of Fle&s;h and Water with|out
Acids, as Salt, Vinegar, and
Bread, without falling into a putrid
Fever. If his Diet con&s;i&s;ted of Snails,
Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially their Livers, Shell-Fi&s;h,
Vipers, ravenous Birds, as &s;ome
who feed upon In&s;ects and alka|le&s;cent
Vegetables, the Effect would
happen &s;ooner. Eggs and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Wines, taken in great Quantities with|out
Exerci&s;e, will occa&s;ion a Fever. A|bundance
of good Blood and laudable
Juices di&s;po&s;eth towards this alkale&s;|cent
State. Likewi&s;e long Ab&s;tinence,
(by which the Fluids are depriv'd of
a Dilution of the cooling Emul&s;ion
of fre&s;h Chyle. See <HI>Prop.</HI> VIII. <HI>Chap.</HI>
II.) great Strength of the Bowels, and
a right State and Abundance of Bile.
Bile is an anti-acid. Another Cau&s;e
is a vigorous Action of the Ve&s;&s;els,
through which the Juices circulate,
which is the Rea&s;on &s;trong healthy
and young People are more in peril
<PB N="178" REF="208">
by pe&s;tilential Fevers, than the Weak
and Old.</P>
<P>Violent Animal Motion produ|ceth
this alkaline State. Two hard
Bones rubb'd hard again&s;t one ano|ther,
or with a File, produce a fetid
Smell. It is po&s;&s;ible to produce a
Gangrene by &s;trong Friction, and
yet Stagnation of the Fluids turns
them putrid.</P>
<P>The Effects of &s;uch an alkale&s;cent
State in any great Degree, are Thir&s;t,
and a Dejection of Appetite, which pu|trid
Things occa&s;ion more than any
other; (tho&s;e who are troubled with
Acidity have often a bad Dige&s;tion,
but a craving Appetite) nidoro&s;e e|ructations,
which are different from a|cid,
Foulne&s;s of the Tongue and
Palate, a bitter and hot Ta&s;te in the
Mouth, Thir&s;t, Sickne&s;s, Loathing,
bilious Vomitings and Dejections of
a cadaverous Smell, iliacal Pains with
Heat. The&s;e are the Effects of it
in the alimentary Diet. Such a
<PB N="179" REF="209">
State di&s;&s;olves the Blood, and di&s;po|&s;eth
it towards Putrefaction, hinders
Nutrition; for no Chicken can be
hatch'd of a rotten Egg, the Blood
turning acrimonious corrodes the
Ve&s;&s;els producing Hemorrhages, Pu&s;|tules
red, lead-colour'd, black and
gangrenous, and almo&s;t all Di&s;ea&s;es
of the inflammatory Kind.</P>
<P>3. The Aliment of &s;uch Per&s;ons
ought to be ace&s;cent Sub&s;tances, as
Bread, Vinegar, &s;uch as are de&s;crib'd
in the foregoing Chapter. Acids
keep Animal Sub&s;tances from Putre|faction;
for neither Blood, Fle&s;h or
Fat will putrify in Vinegar, or &s;our
Wine: The Effect of the &s;tronge&s;t
Acids, even Oil of Vitriol in putrid
Fevers, is known by Experience, in
which your alkaline Spirits mu&s;t be
hurtful, farinaceous Things, e&s;pecial|ly
&s;uch as are made of Oats, are
proper as having an ace&s;cent Quali|ty;
it is a common Mi&s;take that
People in &s;uch a State &s;hould for|bear
<PB N="180" REF="210">
Wine. Thin Wines, as Rheni&s;h,
Mo&s;elle mix'd with Water are pro|per
in a Fever. But when the Di&s;|temper
is attended with great Heat,
Milk mixed with Water is the pro|pere&s;t
Drink. The propere&s;t Sea|&s;oning
is Salt-petre; Sea-&s;alt creates
Thir&s;t, Water is the only Diluent;
but as it has no Acidity in it, it is
better mix'd with Limon, or with
the Rob or Jelly of &s;ome acid Fruit,
&s;ometimes the demulcent Aliment
mention'd <HI>Prop.</HI> IV. of the foregoing
Chapter, will be of great U&s;e.</P>
<P>The muriatick Scurvy induced
commonly by too great Quantity
of Sea-&s;alt, and common among
Mariners, is rather an artificial than
a natural Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;pontaneous only
in few who have a great Di&s;po&s;ition
towards it. Its common Symptoms
are a &s;aline Ta&s;te in the Spittle, Itch|ing
and red Ero&s;ions of the Skin,
great Thir&s;t, Dryne&s;s of the Skin, a
lixivial Urine &s;ometimes with a fatty
<PB N="181" REF="211">
Sub&s;tance like a thin Skin a-top,
Relief from watery and acid Sub|&s;tances.
The Cure of this Di&s;tem|per
lies in a Diet of fre&s;h un&s;alted
Things, watery Liquors acidulated,
farinaceous emollient Sub&s;tances, &s;our
Milk, Butter Milk, acid Fruits, and
avoiding of the hot Anti&s;corbuticks
of the Mu&s;tard Kind, the Rule of
Diet is not much different from that
in the alkaline Scurvy before men|tion'd.</P>
<P>5. It is of great Importance to
know whether cutaneous Di&s;tempers
proceed from an acid or alkaline
Cau&s;e, becau&s;e, according to the dif|ference
of the Cau&s;e, there mu&s;t be
quite oppo&s;ite Methods of Cure;
they may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd fir&s;t by the
difference of the Diet that occa&s;ion'd
them, crude Aliment, farinaceous Sub|&s;tances,
unripe Fruits, and other Ace&s;|cents
will &s;ometimes produce the Scur|vy
and Itch, and even Lepro&s;ies de|pending
on the &s;ame cau&s;e, in which
<PB N="182" REF="212">
volatile Salts, and &s;uch as are taken
from Animal Sub&s;tances are indica|ted.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> From the Ab&s;ence of
the concomitant Symptoms of the
one, and the other: in the acid Acri|mony,
there is not Thir&s;t, Heat nor
&s;o great a Dejection of Appetite as
in the Alkaline. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Ero|&s;ions
of the Skin are not of &s;o deep
a Colour in the Acid as Alkaline. In
general, an Attention to the Symp|toms
before enumerated may be a
Guide to the Diet.</P>
<P>6. Another Con&s;titution of the
Fluids of a Human Body, may be
properly call'd Glutinous or Phleg|matick:
Phlegm among&s;t the An|cients
&s;ignified a cold vi&s;cous Hu|mour
contrary to the Etymology of
the Word which comes from <ADD><GAP DESC="foreign"></ADD>,
to burn; but among&s;t them there
were two Sorts of Phlegm, cold and
hot. A cold Tumor they call'd &s;im|ply
Phlegmonem; when it came from
glutinous Blood, they call'd it Phleg|monem
Phlegmenodem.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="213">
7. Phlegm or Pituite is a Sort of
&s;emi-fluid, it being &s;o far &s;olid, that
one Part draws along &s;everal other
Parts adhering to it, which doth not
happen in a perfect Fluid, and yet
no Part will draw the whole Ma&s;s,
as happens in a perfect Solid.</P>
<P>8. The Pituite or Mucus &s;ecern'd
in the No&s;e, Mouth, Palate, Stomach,
Inte&s;tines, and Wind-Pipe, is not an
excrementitious but a laudable Hu|mour,
nece&s;&s;ary for defending tho&s;e
Parts from which it is &s;ecern'd, from
Excoriations, as happens in the No&s;e,
when the Pituite is too thin. The
Want of it in the Wind-Pipe occa|&s;ions
Hoar&s;ene&s;s, in the Gullet and
Difficulty of Swallowing. The Pituite
defends the Inte&s;tines from the Acri|mony
of the Inge&s;ta, and lubricates
the Extremities of the Joints. There|fore
tho&s;e are mi&s;taken who imagine
that Phlegm cannot be too much
purg'd off; but when the Phlegm is
either too vi&s;cous, or &s;eparates in too
<PB N="184" REF="214">
great a Quantity, it brings the Body
into a morbid State; this vi&s;cous
Phlegm &s;eems to be the vitrious Pi|tuite
of the Ancients.</P>
<P>9. The fir&s;t Seat of it is the ali|mentary
Duct where it creates Cru|dity,
Dejection of Appetite, a Sen&s;e
of Repletion and Sickne&s;s; for it
hinders the natural Contraction of
the Fibres, and that Sen&s;e of Irrita|tion
which produceth Hunger. A
Sen&s;ation of Fullne&s;s without eating
is a &s;ure Sign of a phlegmatick Sto|mach.
In the Inte&s;tines it occa&s;ions
a Tumor of the Belly, with an Atro|phy
in the re&s;t of the Body; for
the vi&s;cous Cru&s;t &s;tops the Entry of
the Chyle into the Lacteals. The
Ca&s;e of rickety Children. In the
Body it often affects the Lungs,
Phlegm may be &s;o concocted in the
Lungs by the Evaporation of its
mo&s;t liquid Parts as to &s;hut up the
Pa&s;&s;ages of the Bronchea, and it makes
Palene&s;s in the Skin; for as it was
<PB N="185" REF="215">
ob&s;erv'd before, our Aliment in the
form of Chyle before it circulates
with the Blood is whiti&s;h, by the
Force of Circulation, it runs through
all the intermediate Colours till it
&s;ettles in an inten&s;e Red; as much
as the Force of Circulation is defi|cient,
&s;o much will the Blood fall
&s;hort of that florid Colour, and Per|&s;ons
in that Condition are call'd
Leucophlegmatick; from this Phlegm
proceed white cold Tumors, Vi&s;ci|dity,
and con&s;equently Immeability
of the Juices; hence Lethargies in
old People.</P>
<P>10. The Cau&s;es of this phlegma|tick
Con&s;titution are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Vi&s;cid
Aliment as of unripe Fruits, farina|ceous
Sub&s;tances unfermented and
taken in great Quantities. The Flowers
of Grains mix'd with Water will
make a &s;ort of Glue. Meals have
an Oil in them which makes their
Parts adhere. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Great Lo&s;s
or Want of Blood which is a natu|ral
<PB N="186" REF="216">
Soap, pre&s;erving it&s;elf and the
Aliment from Coagulation by con|&s;tant
Motion. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Weakne&s;s and
Indige&s;tion in the alimentary Duct
which leaves the Aliment vi&s;cous.
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> A Defect or bad Con&s;ti|tution
of the Bile (which is the chief
Re&s;olvent of the Aliment) phlegma|tick
and bilious Con&s;titutions are
oppo&s;ite. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> Di&s;&s;ipation of the
mo&s;t fluid Parts by Heat or &s;ome
great Evacuation, therefore profu&s;e
Sweats, and Fluxes of Urine di&s;po&s;e
towards this Con&s;titution by thicken|ing
the Phlegm. <HI>Sixthly,</HI> Stagna|tion
from the Debility of In&s;tru|ments
of Excretion for if the Pi|tuite
&s;tagnates, it mu&s;t grow vi&s;cid
from Heat. The&s;e are the Cau&s;es
and Symptoms of a phlegmatick
cold Con&s;titution, but Spi&s;&s;itude at|tended
with Heat grows inflamma|tory.</P>
<P>11. The Symptoms point to the
Cure. All the Methods of atte|nuating,
<PB N="187" REF="217">
mention'd <HI>Chap.</HI> V. <HI>Prop.</HI> IV.
well fermented Bread, and well fer|mented
Liquors, Fermentation de|&s;troys
the Vi&s;cidity of farinaceous
Sub&s;tances. High &s;ea&s;on'd Aliment
is proper for Phlegmaticks. Spices,
Onions, Garlick, di&s;&s;olve Vi&s;cidity.
Water impregnated with &s;ome &s;timu|lating
Sub&s;tance which both dilutes
and attenuates. Hot Mineral Wa|ters
are the be&s;t Di&s;&s;olvers of Phlegm.
All Sorts of Nouri&s;hment which pro|mote
Heat, and a vigorous Motion
of the Blood, and for that Rea&s;on
Broths made of the mo&s;t volatile and
alkale&s;cent Parts of Animals.</P>
<P>12. A Di&s;ea&s;e oppo&s;ite to this
Spi&s;&s;itude is too great Fluidity, the
Symptoms of which are Exce&s;s of
Animal Secretions as of Per&s;piration,
Swear, Urine, Liquid, Dejectures,
Leanne&s;s, Weakne&s;s, and Thir&s;t. The
Methods in &s;uch a Ca&s;e mu&s;t be op|po&s;ite
to the former. Farinaceous
Sub&s;tances, and watery Liquors, un|fermented
<PB N="188" REF="218">
Gellies of Animal and Ve|getable
Sub&s;tances, all &s;uch Things
as are de&s;crib'd <HI>Prop.</HI> IV. <HI>Chap.</HI> V.</P>
<P>13. Another Con&s;titution is the oily
or fat; Animal Fat is a Sort of am|phibious
Sub&s;tance, it is &s;ci&s;&s;ile like
a Solid, re&s;olvable by Heat not greater
than what is incident to Human
Bodies, circum&s;crib'd and contain'd
in proper Ve&s;&s;els, like a Fluid. The
Symptoms of this Con&s;titution are
too manife&s;t to want a De&s;cription,
it co-incides often with the pletho|rick
and phlegmatick Con&s;titutions
above de&s;crib'd. It is but one Spe|cies
of Corpulency, for there may
be Bulk without Fat, from the great
Quantity of mu&s;cular Fle&s;h, the Ca&s;e
of robu&s;t People. An Animal in the
Cour&s;e of hard Labour &s;eems to be
nothing, but Ve&s;&s;els, Bones and mu&s;|cular
Fle&s;h. Let the &s;ame Animal
continue long in Re&s;t, it will per|haps
double in Weight and Bulk.
This Superaddition is nothing but
<PB N="189" REF="219">
Fat or Oil, and in this Sen&s;e an A|nimal
perhaps never arrives at its full
Growth.</P>
<P>14. The common Cau&s;es of this
Di&s;temper are a particular, and per|haps
a gentilitious Di&s;po&s;ition of Bo|dy,
which &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in the Chy|lopoetick
or Organs of the fir&s;t Di|ge&s;tion
being &s;trong, and the Fibres
of the circulating Ve&s;&s;els, e&s;pecially
tho&s;e about the <HI>Panniculus carno&s;us</HI>
being lax, according to the Doctrine
of the &s;econd Chapter. By the Ac|tion
of the Fibres of the Ve&s;&s;els up|on
the Fluids the oily Parts of the
Chyle are intimately mix'd with the
Blood, which by <HI>Prop.</HI> III. <HI>Chap.</HI> II.
will &s;wim a top of it &s;everal Hours
after Repa&s;t; when this Action is not
&s;trong enough, and the Chyle ex|tremely
copious, perhaps the thicker
Oil is never entirely &s;ubdu'd; &s;ome
Sorts of cramm'd Fowl have always
a milky Juice &s;wimming a-top of
their Blood. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Quantities of
<PB N="190" REF="220">
oily Nouri&s;hment, Milk, Butter, and
oily fermented Liquors. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> All
Things which occa&s;ion Coldne&s;s in
the Skin &s;o as to &s;top Per&s;piration,
by which the oily Parts are con|geal'd,
which Heat re&s;olves and at|tenuates.
The Inhabitants of cold
moi&s;t Countries are generally more
fat than tho&s;e of warm and dry; but
the mo&s;t common Cau&s;e is too great
a Quantity of Food, and too &s;mall
a Quantity of Motion, in plain <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI>
Gluttony, and Lazine&s;s. I am
of Opinion that &s;pare Diet and La|bour
will keep Con&s;titutions, where
this Di&s;po&s;ition is the &s;tronge&s;t, from
being fat. You may &s;ee in an Ar|my
forty thou&s;and Foot-Soldiers with|out
a fat Man among&s;t them; and I
dare affirm that by Plenty and Re&s;t,
twenty of the forty &s;hall grow fat.</P>
<P>15. The Oil in Animals is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for many Purpo&s;es; in all for
Motion, in &s;ome for Nouri&s;hment;
&s;uch accumulate Fat in the Summer
<PB N="191" REF="221">
which &s;erves to refre&s;h the Blood in
the Penury of Aliment during the
Winter, and for that purpo&s;e &s;ome
Animals have a quadruple Omen|tum.
But the too great abundance
of Fat &s;ubjects Human Con&s;titutions
to the following Inconveniences.</P>
<P>16. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It hinders the Motion
of the Joints by making them more
heavy by filling the Spaces, occupy'd
by the Mu&s;cles when they contract
and &s;well. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It &s;ubjects them
to all the Di&s;ea&s;es depending upon a
defective projectile Motion of the
Blood; for the Blood flows through
the Ve&s;&s;els by the Exce&s;s of the Force
of the Heart above the incumbent
Pre&s;&s;ure, which in fat People is ex|ce&s;&s;ive;
and as want of a due Quan|tity
of Motion of the Fluids increa&s;|eth
Fat, the Di&s;ea&s;e is the Cau&s;e of
it&s;elf. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To Suppurations, of
which the <HI>Membrana adipo&s;a</HI> is the
chief Seat. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> To danger in
inflammatory Di&s;tempers, a Fever re|&s;olves
<PB N="192" REF="222">
many Things which &s;tagnate,
and among&s;t others the Fat, which
being mix'd with the Blood turns

much more dangerous than the &s;a|line;
for Salts can be diluted with
Water which Oils cannot. That the
Fat is di&s;&s;olv'd by Fevers, is evident
from the great lo&s;s of Fat which
People undergo in Fevers. Among&s;t
tho&s;e and many other bad Effects of
this oily Con&s;titution, there is one
Advantage that &s;uch of them who
arrive to an advanc'd Age, are not
&s;ubject to the Stricture and Hard|ne&s;s
of Fibres, the Effect of old
Age.</P>
<P>17. The Cau&s;es above mention'd
lead directly to the Cure; as it is the
Product of Gluttony and Lazine&s;s,
Exerci&s;e and Ab&s;tinence is the Anti|dote;
it has been ob&s;erv'd that a fe|veri&s;h
Heat re&s;olves Fat, and there|fore

Onions, Vinegar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> taken

Fever. Salt taken in great
Quantities will reduce an Animal Bo|dy

&s;en&s;ible of the Force of Stimulating

&s;aponaceous Sub&s;tances, as Sugar,
Honey, the Juices of ripe Fruits, Pot

Unfermented watery Liquors are hurt|ful

were us'd only as Coolers, they would
not be &s;o proper in this Ca&s;e, in
which it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep up a
con&s;iderable Degree of Heat; but
for their foremention'd Qualities they
are &s;trongly indicated in the inflam|matory
Di&s;tempers of fat People,
where the Oil di&s;po&s;eth to a rancid
Putrefaction; but Ab&s;tinence being
the chief dietetick Method of pre|venting
or curing the Di&s;ea&s;e, leads
me to &s;ay &s;omewhat of the Quantity
of Aliment in general.</P>
<P>18. By <HI>Prop.</HI> VIII. <HI>Chap.</HI> II. The
frequent Repetition of Aliment is
nece&s;&s;ary, not only for repairing the
Fluids and Solids, but to keep the
<PB N="195" REF="225">
Fluids from the putre&s;cent alkaline
State, which they acquire by con&s;tant
Attrition without being diluted; from
whence it follows, <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> That long
Ab&s;tinence may be the Parent of
great Di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially in hot bi|lious
Con&s;titutions, and extremely
painful to acid Con&s;titutions by the
unea&s;y Sen&s;ation it creates in the Sto|mach.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Quantity
of Aliment nece&s;&s;ary to keep the A|nimal
in a due State of Vigour ought
to be divided into Meals at proper
Intervals in the natural Day, by
which Method neither the chylopoe|tick
Organs, nor the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els
are overcharg'd, nor the Juices de|priv'd
too long of fre&s;h Recruits of
Chyle. <HI>Sanctorius</HI> confirms this Ma|xim
in his Doctrine of Per&s;pira|tion.</P>
<P>19. The great Secret of Health
is keeping the Fluids in due Propor|tion
to the Capacity and Strength of
the Channels through which they
<PB N="196" REF="226">
pa&s;s; but the Danger is le&s;s when
the Quantity of the Fluid is too
&s;mall; than when it is too great, for
a &s;maller Quantity of Fluid will pa&s;s
where a larger cannot, but not con|trariwi&s;e.</P>
<P>20. When the Quantity of the
Fluid is too &s;mall, the ela&s;tick Pow|er
of the Canal (in which Life con|&s;i&s;ts)
exerts it&s;elf with too great a
Strength upon the Fluid. In which
Ca&s;e there mu&s;t follow too great a
Di&s;&s;ipation of the Fluid, Dryne&s;s
and a gradual Decay. In too great
Repletion either the ela&s;tick Force
of the Tube is totally de&s;troy'd; or
if it continue proportional to the
Degree of Exten&s;ion like a Bow too
&s;trongly drawn, it throws the Fluid
with too great a projectile Force
forward through the Ve&s;&s;els, and
back upon the Heart, and &s;ubjects
the Animal to all the Di&s;ea&s;es de|pending
upon a Plethory, and may
bring it into immediate Danger.
<PB N="197" REF="227">
Therefore the Di&s;ea&s;es depending up|on
Repletion are more acute and
dangerous than tho&s;e that depend
upon the contrary State. The In|&s;tances
of Longevity are chiefly a|mong&s;t
the Ab&s;temious. Ab&s;tinence
in Extremity will prove a mortal
Di&s;ea&s;e, but the Experiments of it
are very rare.</P>
<P>21. Such as have an imperfect
Circulation through any Organ of
the Body, &s;hould never charge their
Ve&s;&s;els with too great a Quantity of
Chyle, this was ob&s;erv'd <HI>Prop.</HI> II.
<HI>Chap.</HI> II. of the Lungs, and is equal|ly
true in any other Ca&s;e, as in Head|aches,
which eating little relieves,
and eating and drinking much occa|&s;ion.
A Sen&s;ation of Drou&s;ine&s;s,
Oppre&s;&s;ion, Heavine&s;s and La&s;&s;itude
are Signs of a too plentiful Meal,
e&s;pecially in young People.</P>
<P>22. The Mea&s;ure of in&s;en&s;ible
Per&s;piration di&s;cover'd by weighing
is the be&s;t Rule of Diet; therefore
<PB N="198" REF="228">
in fat People the U&s;e of vaporo&s;e or
per&s;pirable Food, and exerci&s;e (both
which increa&s;e Per&s;piration) are pro|per.</P>
<P>23. The Con&s;titution of the Air
di&s;po&s;eth the Inhabitants of one
Country more to be fat than that of
another. <HI>Sanctorius's</HI> Experiment of
Per&s;piration being to the other Se|cretions
as 5 to 3 does not hold in
this Country, except in the hotte&s;t
Time of Summer; &s;o that the Acti|on
of <HI>Paduan</HI> Air in promoting Per|&s;piration
the whole Year round, is
equal to ours in the Month of <HI>Au|gu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>24. From the foregoing Doctrine,
a common Ca&s;e both of fat and lean
Men having great Stomachs may be
accounted for: by the la&s;t having a
great Per&s;piration, and &s;ome of the
per&s;pirable Matter in the fir&s;t not
&s;ufficiently attenuated, &s;topping at
the Surface of the Skin, and as it
were carried about him. Hunger is
<PB N="199" REF="229">
only a Warning of the Ve&s;&s;els being
in &s;uch a State of Vacuity as to re|quire
a fre&s;h Supply of Aliment, af|ter
Secretions, the Ve&s;&s;els of the fat
and lean Man are equally empty; for
the Fat is as much out of the Thread
of Circulation as what is evaporated,
and perhaps the Fat in that Ca&s;e
becomes like a morbid Excre&s;cence,
requiring a &s;uperfluous Nutrition.</P>
<P>25. Infants and old People &s;up|port
Ab&s;tinence wor&s;t. The fir&s;t
from the Quantity of Aliment con|&s;um'd

their Weakne&s;s, and the &s;mall Quan|tity
of Aliment taken at once. The
Middle-aged &s;upport it the be&s;t, be|cau&s;e
of the oily Parts abounding in
the Blood.</P>
<P>26. From the foregoing Princi|ples
follow naturally the Hippocrati|cal
Rules of Diet in Fevers, of giv|ing
more or le&s;s, more thick, or more
thin Aliment, according to the fore|&s;een
time of the Duration of the Fe|ver;
<PB N="200" REF="230">
for Example, in an Ephemera

one Day, in a Fever of four Days
Duration le&s;s than in one of eight.
And as the Fever comes to its
Height &s;till &s;ubtracting from the
Quantity of Aliment, and making it
more diluent and thin.</P>
<P>27. We come now to what we
may call the earthy or atrabilarian
Con&s;titution, where the &s;pirituous
and mo&s;t fluid Parts of the Blood
are di&s;&s;ipated, that is the Spirit, Wa|ter
and &s;ubtile Oil &s;o much evapo|rated,
as to leave the Salts, Earth,
and gro&s;&s;er Oil in too great a Pro|portion.
The Blood grows darki&s;h
and thick, &s;uch a Con&s;titution the
Ancients call'd Atrabilarian or melan|cholick:
Melancholy, &s;ignifying in
<HI>Greek,</HI> black Gall; whether there be
any &s;uch Humour as black Gall, is
only a Di&s;pute about Words. <HI>Hip|pocrates</HI>
gave &s;uch an Humour this
Name, and that is &s;ufficient; be&s;ides
<PB N="201" REF="231">
it is matter of fact, that in the Ex|tremity
of this Di&s;ea&s;e, the Gall it|&s;elf
will turn of a blacki&s;h Colour,
and the Blood verge towards a pitchy
Con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>28. The Signs of a Tendency to
&s;uch a State, are Darkne&s;s or Lividi|ty
of the Countenance, Dryne&s;s of
the Skin, Leanne&s;s, a penetrating
quick Genius, a &s;low Pul&s;e and Re|&s;piration.
The Cau&s;es of it are all
&s;uch as expel the mo&s;t volatile Parts
of the Blood, and fix the Re&s;idue:
Great Applications of the Mind to
one Object, either &s;uch as produce
Sadne&s;s, or great Joy, both which
equally di&s;&s;ipate the Spirits, and im|moderate
Exerci&s;e in hot Air with un|quench'd
Thir&s;t: Aliments of hard
Dige&s;tion, as dry'd and &s;alted Fle&s;h,
unripe Fruits, farinaceous Sub&s;tances
unfermented, and likewi&s;e immode|rate
U&s;e of &s;pirituous Liquors.</P>
<P>The Effects of &s;uch a vapid and
vi&s;cous Con&s;titution of Blood, are
<PB N="202" REF="232">
Stagnation, Ob&s;tructions, Acrimo|ny,
Putrefactions, Vi&s;cidity, and im|perfect
Secretion of the Gall, a de|fective
Circulation, e&s;pecially in the
lateral Branches de&s;tined to &s;eparate
the more fluid Parts, and therefore
vi&s;cous, and &s;paring Secretions in
the Glands: The Blood moving too
&s;lowly through the celiack and me|&s;enterick
Arteries, produce various
Complaints in the lower Bowels and
Hypochondres; from whence &s;uch
Per&s;ons are call'd Hypochondriack:
Such as Sen&s;ation of Weight, Anxie|ty
and Repletion, a bad Dige&s;tion;
from whence different Kinds of Ali|ment
acquire &s;uch a State as they
affect of their own Nature, ace&s;cent,
if the Diet is of acid Vegetables,
and alkaline or nidoro&s;e, if of Ani|mal
Sub&s;tances, e&s;pecially Fat, which
remains rancid &s;o as the Spittle will
&s;ometimes flame in the Fire. This
Indige&s;tion proceeds from the Inac|tivity
of the Gall, which likewi&s;e oc|ca&s;ions

a Con&s;tipation of the Belly,
and a Difficulty of being purg'd.
The Urine is &s;ometimes limpid,
&s;ometimes thick, which latter is of|ten
a Sign of Recovery. The Ob|&s;truction
of the Pituite in the lower
Belly, forceth it upon the &s;alivary
Glands, and produceth Spitting.</P>
<P>29. Such a State of the Fluids at
la&s;t affects the tender capillary Ve&s;|&s;els
of the Brain by the Vi&s;cidity and
Immeability of the Matter impacted
in them, and di&s;orders the Imagi|nation,
and at la&s;t produceth Cor|ruption
in the Bowels of the lower
Belly.</P>
<P>30. It is plain, that the Removal
of &s;uch a Di&s;ea&s;e is not to be at|tempted
by active Remedies, any
more than a Thorn in the Fle&s;h, or
pitchy Matter adhering to a Thread
of Silk is to be taken away by Vio|lence;
what is vi&s;cid, ought to be
gently attenuated, diluted and carried
off. That all Sub&s;tances, which do
<PB N="204" REF="234">
heat, will &s;till di&s;&s;ipate the fluid Parts
more, and con&s;equently increa&s;e the
Di&s;ea&s;e. Therefore Water impregnat|ed
with &s;ome penetrating Salt, is
found to have great Effects in this
Di&s;temper. The Diet ought to be
oppo&s;ite to the particular Acrimony,
whether acid or alkaline, which it is
ea&s;y to gue&s;s at by N^o. 5. of this
Propo&s;ition. It ought to be demul|cent,
in both Ca&s;es light, and of ea|&s;y
Dige&s;tion, moi&s;tening and re&s;ol|vent

vegetable Soaps, as Honey, and the
Juices of ripe Fruits, &s;ome of the
cooling, lacte&s;cent, pape&s;cent Plants,
as Cichory, Letuce, Dandelion, which
are found effectual in hot Countries.

<P>To draw a few general Inferences
from the foregoing Doctrine.</P>
<P>From the Doctrine of this &s;hort
E&s;&s;ay, it is as ea&s;y to determine the
Rules of Diet in the different natu|ral
States, as in the different morbid
States of a Human Body.</P>
<P>1. By <HI>Prop.</HI> VII. <HI>Chap.</HI> II. Infan|cy
and Childhood demand thin co|pious
nouri&s;hing Aliment, &s;uch as
lengthens their Fibres without break|ing
or hardening, becau&s;e of their
Weakne&s;s and State of Accretion.
Milk has all tho&s;e Qualities.</P>
<P>2. By <HI>Prop.</HI> IV. <HI>Chap.</HI> II. The So|lidity,
Quantity and Strength of the
Aliment is to be proportion'd to the
Labour or Quantity of mu&s;cular
Motion, which in Youth is greater
than any other Age, upon which Ac|count
a &s;trong and &s;olid Diet would
&s;eem to be indicated; but as that
<PB N="206" REF="236">
Age is &s;till in a State of Accretion,
their Diet ought &s;till to be emollient,
and relaxing, copious, and without
Acrimony.</P>
<P>3. The Diet of a Human Crea|ture
full grown, and in the State of
Manhood ought to be &s;olid, with a
&s;ufficient Degree of Tenacity, with|out
Acrimony, their chief Drink Wa|ter
cold, becau&s;e in &s;uch a State it
has its own natural Spirit and Air,
(which Heat de&s;troys) with a Quanti|ty
of fermented Liquors propor|tion'd
to their natural Con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>4. The Cour&s;e of the Fluids
through the va&s;cular Solids, and the
common Animal Functions without
any Violence, mu&s;t in length of
Time harden the Fibres, aboli&s;h ma|ny
of the Canals, and make the So|lids
grow together; from whence
Dryne&s;s, Weakne&s;s, Immobility, De|bility
of the vital Force both of the
fir&s;t and &s;econd Dige&s;tion. Lo&s;s of
Teeth, Depravation of Ma&s;tication,

the Condition of old Age, which
therefore demands a Diet re&s;embling
that of Childhood often repeated, but
not &s;o copious in Proportion to the
Bulk, emollient and diluting.</P>
<P>5. From the Doctrine of the fifth
Chapter, it is likewi&s;e ea&s;y to de|termine
the Inconveniences ari&s;ing
from the Exce&s;s of any one &s;ort of
Diet. Too much Sea-&s;alt produceth
Thir&s;t, Hoar&s;ene&s;s, Acrimony in the
Serum (which de&s;troys its &s;oft nutri|tious
Quality) Ero&s;ion of the &s;mall
Fibres, Pains, and all the Symptoms
of the muriatick Scurvy.</P>
<P>6. Acids taken in too great Quan|tities,
e&s;pecially &s;uch as are au&s;tere,
as unripe Fruits, produce too great a
Stricture of the Fibres, incra&s;&s;ate and
coagulate the Fluids; from whence
Pains, Rheumati&s;m and Gout, Pale|ne&s;s,
Itch, and other Eruptions of
the Skin: Sub&s;tances extremely &s;tip|tick
are hurtful to the Nerves, and
occa&s;ion Pal&s;ies.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="238">
7. Spices in too great Quantities
occa&s;ion Thir&s;t; Dryne&s;s and Heat,

Motion of the Blood, di&s;&s;ipate the
Fluids; from whence Leanne&s;s, Pains
in the Stomach, Loathings, and Fe|vers.</P>
<P>8. Strong Liquors, e&s;pecially in|flammable
Spirits, taken in great
Quantities, intoxicate, con&s;tringe, har|den,
dry, and &s;timulate the Fibres,
and coagulate the Fluids. They cor|rode
and de&s;troy the inward Coat of
the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, and if
Dige&s;tion be a Putrefaction, Spirits
mu&s;t by their natural Quality hinder
that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Chi&s;elton's</HI> Anatomy.</NOTE> they produce Debility, Flatu|lency,

the Liver, Fevers, Leucophlegmacy,

Fermentation, as Mu&s;t and new Ale,
are apt to produce Spa&s;ms in the
Stomach, Cholick and Diarrhaeas.</P>
<P>9. A Diet of vi&s;cid Aliment creates
Flatulency and Crudities in the Sto|mach,

Mouths of the Lacteals and Glands,
Tumors and Hardne&s;s of the Belly,
Coldne&s;s, Palene&s;s of the Skin, and
Vi&s;cidity in the Fluids.</P>
<P>10. A Diet of oily Nouri&s;hment
relaxeth the Solids, and particular|ly
the Stomach and the Inte&s;tines,
(Monks who take a great deal of Oil
are &s;ubject to inte&s;tinal Hernias) it
creates nidoro&s;e Eructations, Loath|ings,
Oily and bitter Vomitings, ob|&s;tructs
the capillary Ve&s;&s;els by hin|dering
the Entrance of the watery
and fluid Part, with which it will not

<P><PB N="210" REF="240">
11. A con&s;tant Adherence to one
&s;ort of Diet, may have bad Effects
on any Con&s;titution. Nature has
provided a great Variety of Nou|ri&s;hment
for Human Creatures, and
furni&s;h'd us with Appetites to de&s;ire,
and Organs to dige&s;t them (there is
a mo&s;t curious Bill of Fair in Sir
<HI>Hans Sloan's</HI> Natural Hi&s;tory of <HI>Ja|maica)</HI>
as Aliments have different
Qualities; a con&s;tant Adherence to
one Sort, may make the Con&s;titu|tion
verge to &s;ome of the Extremes
mention'd in this Chapter; for heal|thy
People, <HI>Cel&s;us's</HI> Rule I. Chap. I.
is a good one, <HI>Sanus homo qui bene
valet &amp; &s;uae &s;pontis e&s;t, nullis obliga|re
&s;e Legibus debet, nullum cibi genus
fugere quo populus utitur, interdum in
couvivio e&s;&s;e, interdum ab eo &s;e ab&s;ti|nere,
modo plus, modo amplius a&s;&s;umere,</HI>
&amp;c. The Sen&s;e of the whole Pa&s;|&s;age,
is, That a healthy Man under
his own Government, ought not to tie
him&s;elf up to &s;trict Rules, nor to ab|&s;tain
<PB N="211" REF="241">
from any &s;ort of Food in com|mon
U&s;e, that he ought &s;ometimes
to fea&s;t, &s;ometimes to fa&s;t, &s;ome|times
to &s;leep, &s;ometimes to watch
more than ordinary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> An un|erring
Regularity is almo&s;t impracti|cable,
and the &s;werving from it,
when it is grown habitual, dange|rous;
for every unu&s;ual thing in a
Human Body becomes a Stimulus,
as Wine, or Fle&s;h-Meat to one not
us'd to them; therefore <HI>Cel&s;us's</HI> Rule
with the proper moral Re&s;trictions,
is a good one for People in Health,
and even in Per&s;ons di&s;eas'd in any
of the Sen&s;es of this Chapter, as too
&s;trict, too lax, acid and bilious, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
A con&s;tant Adherence to one Sort of
Diet, may carry the Ca&s;e beyond a
Cure to the contrary Extreme.</P>
<P>12. General Rules about Diet,
without Regard to particular Con&s;ti|tutions,
are ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>13. That with regard to diffe|rent
Con&s;titutions, the common Di&s;|tinction
<PB N="212" REF="242">
of Diet into Vegetable
with Water, and Animal with fer|mented
Liquors, is not proper and
compleat. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e in the E|numeration
of Con&s;titutions in this
Chapter, there is not one that can
be limited and re&s;tricted by &s;uch a
Di&s;tinction, nor can perhaps the
&s;ame Per&s;on in different Circum&s;tan|ces
be properly confin'd to one or
the other. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e a ve|getable
Diet is not characteriz'd, there
is not a general alimentary Quality
in which all Vegetables agree; there
are Vegetables, acid, alkaline, cool|ing,
hot, relaxing, a&s;tringent, acrid,
and mild, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> U&s;eful or hurtful, ac|cording
to the different Con&s;tituti|ons
to which they are apply'd, there
may be a &s;tronger Broth made of
Vegetables than any Gravy-&s;oup.</P>
<P>14. As Fle&s;h-Diet is generally al|kale&s;cent,
and many Vegetables are
acid and cooling; People of hot bi|lious
Con&s;titutions find them&s;elves
<PB N="213" REF="243">
extremely well in a vegetable Diet
and Water, and the &s;ame Per&s;ons
perhaps had enjoy'd their Health as
well with a Mixture of Animal Diet
qualify'd with a &s;ufficient Quantity of
Ace&s;cents, as Bread, Vinegar, and
fermented Liquors.</P>
<P>15. The Oil of mo&s;t Vegeta|bles
in which their nutritious Qua|lity
chiefly con&s;i&s;ts, &s;eems not to
be &s;o hard of Dige&s;tion as that of
Animals; fat Meat is harder to di|ge&s;t
than the mo&s;t oily Plant taken
as Aliment: Sick People could not
take &s;o great a Quantity of melted
Fat, as they can of Oil of &s;weet Al|monds.</P>
<P>16. Animal Sub&s;tances are more
nouri&s;hing, and more ea&s;ily tran&s;mu|table
into Animal Juices, than Vege|table,
and therefore a vegetable Diet
is more proper for &s;ome Con&s;tituti|ons,
as being le&s;s nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>17. As the Qualities of Plants are
more various than tho&s;e of Animal
<PB N="214" REF="244">
Sub&s;tances, a Diet of &s;ome Sorts of
Vegetables may be more effectual in
the Cure of &s;ome chronical Di&s;tem|pers,
than an Animal Diet.</P>
<P>18. The fibrous or va&s;cular Parts
of Vegetables &s;eem &s;carce changeable
in the Alimentary Duct. The Dung
of Hor&s;es is nothing but the Fila|ments
of the Hay, and as &s;uch Com|bu&s;tible.</P>
<P>19. Vegetables abound more with
aerial Particles, than Animal Sub&s;tan|ces;
and therefore are more flatulent.</P>
<P>20. Man is by his Frame as well
as his Appetite a carnivorous Ani|mal;
the In&s;truments of Dige&s;tion
are &s;o well adapted to the proper
Food of each Animal, that from the
Structure of the Fir&s;t, it is ea&s;y to
gue&s;s at the Second. Mo&s;t Quadru|pedes
that live upon Herbs, have
inci&s;or Teeth to pluck and divide
them: after they are &s;wallow'd, they
are brought up again from one Sto|mach
to receive a new Alteration
<PB N="215" REF="245">
by a &s;econd Ma&s;tication, after that
the Ma&s;s &s;o prepar'd, pa&s;&s;eth through
four Stomachs of different Figures
and Structure before it comes into
the Inte&s;tines. This is the Ca&s;e of
ruminating Animals, except &s;ome
few; as of Hares who have but one
Stomach, by which it appears, that
Nature is at a great deal of Labour
to tran&s;mute Vegetable into Animal
Sub&s;tances: Therefore Herb-eating
Animals, which don't ruminate, have
&s;trong Grinders, and chew much.
There have been &s;everal In&s;tances of
ruminating Men, and that Quality
leaving them, was a Symptom of
approaching Sickne&s;s, Vid. <HI>Philo&s;oph.

Granivorous Birds have the
Mechani&s;m of a Mill, their Maw is
the Happer, which holds and &s;oftens
the Grain, letting it drop by Degrees
into the Stomach where it is ground
by two &s;trong Mu&s;cles, in which
Action they are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;mall
<PB N="216" REF="246">
Stones which they &s;wallow for the
Purpo&s;e, and becau&s;e this Action of
Grinding; cannot be perform'd by
the weaker Stomachs of their Young;
many of them, as Pigeons, half di|ge&s;t
the Aliment before they give it.
Some Birds that live upon Sub&s;tan|ces
ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olvable, as Worms,
Eggs, have the Coats of the Sto|machs
&s;mooth; as Cuckows. Birds
of Prey that live upon Animal Sub|&s;tances,
have membranaceous not
mu&s;cular Stomachs.</P>
<P>The be&s;t In&s;truments for dividing
of Herbs are inci&s;or Teeth; for crack|ing
of hard Sub&s;tances, as Bones
and Nuts; Grinders or Mill-Teeth;
for dividing of Fle&s;h; &s;harp-pointed
or Dog-Teeth, which &s;eem to be &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary for that Purpo&s;e, that an
Eagle has &s;uch Teeth not in his Bill,
but two at the Root of his Tongue
to hold his Prey, and three Rows in
his Jaws at the Entry of his Gullet.
A Human Creature has all the three
<PB N="217" REF="247">
Sorts of Teeth; the Teeth and Sto|machs
of &s;ome carnivorous Bea&s;ts,
don't differ much from the Human.
A Lion has generally fourteen in
each Jaw; four Inci&s;ors, four Ca|nine,
and &s;ix Grinders, &s;harpi&s;h, for
dividing of Fle&s;h as well as cracking
of Bones. A Human Creature has
commonly &s;ixteen Teeth in each
Jaw, two of them only Canine.
The inward Coat of a Lion's Sto|mach
has &s;tronger Folds than a Hu|man,
but in other Things not much
different. The Stomachs of Water-Fowl
that live upon Fi&s;h are Hu|man;
therefore it &s;eems that Nature
has provided Human Creatures with
In&s;truments to prepare and dige&s;t al|mo&s;t
all Sorts of alimentary Sub|&s;tances,
as Herbs, Grain, Nuts, by
the Structure of their Parts as well
as Appetites, they are plainly carni|vorous.</P>
<P>21. It has been objected again&s;t
this Doctrine, that Granivorous
<PB N="218" REF="248">
Animals have a long Colon and a
Caecum which in Carnivorous are
wanting. Now it is well known
that a Man has both, Vid. <HI>Philo&s;o|phical
Tran&s;actions;</HI> to this it is an|&s;wer'd
that the Ob&s;ervation is not
true without Exceptions; many car|nivorous
Animals have neither Co|lon
nor Caecum, and many Grani|vorous
have both. There are Ani|mals
not carnivorous that have a
large Caecum and no Colon, and
others that have neither.</P>
<P>There are carnivorous Animals, I
mean &s;uch as eat Fle&s;h &s;ometimes,
that have both Colon and Caecum;
but as the Ob&s;ervation is generally
true, it proves at lea&s;t that Mankind
is de&s;ign'd to take vegetable Food
&s;ometimes, and it is a fre&s;h In&s;tance
of Nature's being at more Labour to
a&s;&s;imilate Vegetable into Animal Sub|&s;tances,
by affording them a longer
and more retarded Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="249">
22. Carnivorous Animals have
more Courage, mu&s;cular Strength,
Activity in Proportion to their Bulk,
which is evident by comparing the
Cat-Kind, as Lions, Tigers; and
likewi&s;e the Dog-Kind with Herb
eating Animals of the &s;ame Bulk.
Birds of Prey excell Granivorous, in
Strength and Courage. I know more
than one In&s;tance of ira&s;cible Pa&s;&s;i|ons
being much &s;ubdu'd by a vege|table
Diet.</P>
<P>23. Fermented Liquors are pro|per,
and perhaps nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch
as live upon an Animal Diet; for
Fle&s;h without being qualify'd with
Acids, as Bread, Vinegar, and fer|mented
Liquors, is too alkale&s;cent a
Diet; and Wine moderately taken,
rather qualifies the Heat of Animal
Food than increa&s;eth it. Water is
the only Diluter, and the be&s;t Di&s;|&s;olvent
of mo&s;t of the Ingredients
of our Aliment. It is found by Ex|perience,
that Water dige&s;teth a full
<PB N="220" REF="250">
Meale, &s;ooner than any other Liquor;
but as it relaxeth, the con&s;tant U&s;e
of it, may hurt &s;ome Con&s;titutions.
As it contains no Acid, it is impro|per
with a Diet that is entirely Alka|le&s;cent.</P>
<P>The Doctrine laid down in this
<HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> is in mo&s;t Particulars (I do
not &s;ay in all) conform to that of
the divine <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> as appears
by &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of his Works;
particularly of his Books of Diet,
of his Method of Diet in acute Di&s;|ea&s;es,
and <HI>Galen's</HI> Commentaries both
upon tho&s;e Books, and &s;ome others
of his Works. I &s;hall in&s;tance in
&s;ome few Particulars as far as relates
to that Part of Diet call'd Aliment,
without refering to the Editions,
Books and Pages, which would be
of &s;mall U&s;e to my Readers. The
Maxims of this great Man are, That
Health depends chiefly upon the
Choice of Aliment.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="251">
That the Phy&s;icians before his
Time were to be blam'd, for not pre|&s;cribing
Rules of Diet.</P>
<P>That he who would skilfully treat
the Subject of Aliment, mu&s;t con&s;i|der
the Nature of Man, the Nature
of Aliments, and the Con&s;titution
of the Per&s;on who takes them.</P>
<P>In his Books of Diet, he de|&s;cribes
the Qualities of all the Sub|&s;tances
which Mankind generally feed
upon.</P>
<P>As of all Sorts of Fle&s;h, many of
which are not in U&s;e among&s;t us,
as of Dogs, Foxes, A&s;&s;es, Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>That the Fle&s;h of Wild Animals
is dryer than that of Tame, of Stall|fed,
than of tho&s;e fed by Pa&s;to|rage.</P>
<P>That the Fle&s;h of Animals, in the
Vigor of their Age, and of &s;uch as
are ca&s;trated, is be&s;t.</P>
<P>That of Animals, which have not
us'd hard Labour, is tendere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="252">
That Beef is bilious that is alka|le&s;cent,
as all Fle&s;h Meat is.</P>
<P>That the Fle&s;h of hot dry Coun|tries
is mo&s;t nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>He is very particular as to Man|ner
of Cookery, that Roa&s;ting de&s;troys
the Humidity.</P>
<P>That &s;alted Fle&s;h &s;hould be mace|rated
and moi&s;ten'd.</P>
<P>That &s;alted Fle&s;h dries, attenuates,
and moves the Belly.</P>
<P>He is likewi&s;e very curious in
tempering the Qualities of his Meats,
by Sea&s;onings of contrary Qualities.</P>
<P>He de&s;cribes the Qualities of the
Fle&s;h of mo&s;t Sorts of Fowl, that
the Fle&s;h of granivorous Birds is not
&s;o moi&s;t and oily as that of Ducks;
he is particular as to the Qualities
of Fi&s;hes fre&s;h and &s;alted, and of all
Vegetables both Alimentary and Me|dicinal;

<P>That unripe Cucumbers are hard
of Dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>That the Fruits of the Earth in
hot Countries, are dryer and hotter
than in cold.</P>
<P>He is no le&s;s exact in de&s;cribing
the Qualities of Milk, Whey, all
Sorts of Bread and Water, which he
choo&s;es clear, light, without Ta&s;te or
Smell, drawn not from Snow, but
from Springs with an Ea&s;terly Expo|&s;ition;
tho' he &s;eems to have known
&s;omething of Mineral Waters, he &s;ays
nothing of the U&s;e of them.</P>
<P>He is no le&s;s accurate in the De|&s;cription
of the Qualities of &s;everal
Sorts of Wines, black, white, au&s;tere,
oily, thin, with the proper U&s;es of
<PB N="224" REF="254">
them, by which it appears, that
Wine was &s;eldom or never drunk in
his Country without Water. He
allows Wine unmix'd after great Di&s;|&s;ipations
of the Spirits by Fatigue,
and regulates the Quantities of it ac|cording
to the Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e con&s;ider'd the Medi|cinal
Qualities of Aliments, and tells
you, that of Aliments &s;ome are laxa|tive,

to alimentary Sub&s;tances, are
the four in common U&s;e among&s;t
the Ancients, as hot, cold, moi&s;t,
and dry; according to tho&s;e, his No|tions
are often very ju&s;t and in&s;truc|tive,
and nothing can be more &s;o
than what follows, that acid, acrid,

nouri&s;h; but by their A&s;tringency
create Horror, that is, &s;timulate the

<P>That Di&s;ea&s;es depend on the Parts

<P>That a Man cannot be healthy

how&s;oever they may be acceptable
to &s;ome one Part, that is (according
to what was &s;aid in this <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>) that
they are a Sort of &s;ub&s;idiary Gall:
