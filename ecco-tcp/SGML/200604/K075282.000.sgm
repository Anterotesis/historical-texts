<HEAD>THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>THOMAS GRAY was born in Cornhill, in the
city of London, on the 26th of December, 1716.
His father, Philip Gray, was a money-&s;crivener; but
being of an indolent and profu&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, he rather
dimini&s;hed than improved his paternal fortune. Our
Author received his cla&s;&s;ical education at Eton &s;chool,
under Mr. Antrobus, his mother's brother, a man
of &s;ound learning and refined ta&s;te, who directed his
nephew to tho&s;e pur&s;uits which laid the foundation of
his future literary fame.</P>
<P>During his continuance at Eton, he contracted a
friend&s;hip with Mr. Horace Walpole, well known for
his knowledge in the fine arts; and Mr. Richard
We&s;t, &s;on of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, a youth
of very promi&s;ing talents.</P>
<P>When he left Eton &s;chool in 1734, he went to
Cambridge, and entered a pen&s;ioner at Peterhou&s;e, at
the recommendation of his uncle Antrobus, who had
been a fellow of that college. It is &s;aid that, from
his effeminacy and fair complexion, he acquired,
among his fellow &s;tudents, the appellation of <HI>Mi&s;s</HI>
Gray, to which the delicacy of his manners &s;eems not
a little to have contributed. Mr. Walpole was at
that time a fellow-commoner of King's College, in the
&s;ame Univer&s;ity; a fortunate circumstance, which af|forded
Gray frequent opportunities of intercour&s;e with
his Honourable Friend.</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;t went from Eton to Chri&s;t Church. Ox|ford;
and in this &s;tate of &s;eparation, the&s;e two vo|taries
of the Mu&s;es, who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions were conge|nial,
commenced an epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence, part of
which is publi&s;hed by Mr. Ma&s;on, a gentleman who&s;e
character &s;tands high in the republic of letters.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
Gray, having imbibed a ta&s;te for poetry, did not
reli&s;h tho&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e &s;tudies which generally occupy
the minds of &s;tudents at College; and therefore, as he
found very little gratification from academical pur&s;uits,
he left Cambridge in 1738, and returned to London,
intending to apply him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the law:
but this intention was &s;oon laid a&s;ide, upon an invita|tion
given him by Mr. Walpole, to accompany him
in his travels abroad; a &s;ituation highly preferable,
in Gray's opinion, to the dry study of the law.</P>
<P>They &s;et out together for France, and vi&s;ited most
of the places worthy of notice in that country: from
thence they proceeded to Italy, where an unfortunate
di&s;pute taking place between them, a &s;eparation en&s;ued
upon their arrival at Florence. Mr. Walpole after|wards,
with great candour and liberality, took upon
him&s;elf the blame of the quarrel; though, if we
con&s;ider the matter coolly and impartially, we may be
induced to conclude that Gray, from a con&s;cious &s;u|periority
of ability, might have claimed a deference
to his opinion and judgment, which his Honourable
Friend was not at that time di&s;po&s;ed to admit: the
rupture, however, was very unplea&s;ant to both par|ties.</P>
<P>Gray pur&s;ued his journey to Venice on an economic
plan, &s;uitable to the circum&s;cribed state of his finan|ces;
and having continued there &s;ome weeks, returned
to England in September, 1741. He appears, from
his letters, publi&s;hed by Mr. Ma&s;on, to have paid the
minute&s;t attention to every object worthy of notice
throughout the cour&s;e of his travels. His de&s;criptions
are lively and picture&s;que, and bear particular marks
of his genius and di&s;po&s;ition. We admire the &s;ub|limity
of his ideas when he a&s;cends the &s;tupendous
heights of the Alps, and are charmed with his di&s;play
of nature, decked in all the beauties of vegetation.
Indeed, abundant information, as well as entertain|ment,
may be derived from his ca&s;ual letters.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">
In about two months after his arrival in England,
he lo&s;t his father, who, by an indi&s;creet profu&s;ion, had
&s;o impaired his fortune, as not to admit of his son's
pro&s;ecuting the &s;tudy of the law with that degree of
re&s;pectability which the nature of the profe&s;&s;ion re|quires,
without becoming burthen&s;ome to his mother
and aunt. To obviate, therefore, their importunities
on the &s;ubject, he went to Cambridge, and took his
bachelor's degree in civil law.</P>
<P>But the inconveniencies and di&s;tre&s;s attached to a
&s;canty fortune were not the only ills our Poet had to
encounter at this time: he had not only lo&s;t the friend|&s;hip
of Mr. Walpole abroad, but poor We&s;t, the
partner of his heart, fell a victim to complicated ma|ladies,
brought on by family misfortunes, on the 1&s;t
of June, 1742, at Popes, a village, in Hertford&s;hire,
where he went for the benefit of the air.</P>
<P>The exce&s;&s;ive degree in which his mind was agita|ted
for the lo&s;s of his friend, will be&s;t appear from the
following beautiful little sonnet:
<Q><L>" In vain to me the &s;miling mornings &s;hine,</L>
<L>" And redd'ning Poebus lifts his go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">den fire:</L>
<L>" The birds in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ain their am'rous de&s;cant join,</L>
<L>" Or cheerful fields re&s;ume their green attire:</L>
<L>" The&s;e ears, ala&s;! for other notes repine;</L>
<L>" A different object do the&s;e eyes require;</L>
<L>" My lonely angui&s;h melts no heart but mine,</L>
<L>" And in my brea&s;t th' imperfect joys expire;</L>
<L>" Yet morning &s;miles the bu&s;y race to cheer,</L>
<L>" And new-born plea&s;ure brings to happier men;</L>
<L>" The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;</L>
<L>" To warn their little loves the birds comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ain:</L>
<L>" I fruitle&s;s mourn to him that cannot hear;</L>
<L>" And weep the more, becau&s;e I weep in vain.'</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Gray now &s;eems to have applied his mind very
&s;edulou&s;ly to poetical compo&s;ition: his <HI>Ode to Spring</HI>
was written early in June, to his friend Mr. We&s;t,
before he received the melancholy news of his death:
how our Poet's &s;u&s;ceptible mind was affected by that
melancholy incident, is evidently demon&s;trated by the
lines quoted above; the impre&s;&s;ion, indeed, appears
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
to have been too deep to be &s;oon effaced; and the te|nour
of the &s;ubjects which called for the exertions of his
poetical talents &s;ub&s;equent to the production of this
Ode, corroborates that ob&s;ervation; the&s;e were his
<HI>Pro&s;pect of Eton,</HI> and his <HI>Ode to Adver&s;ity.</HI> It is al&s;o
&s;uppo&s;ed, and with great probability, that he began
his <HI>Elegy in a Country Church Yard</HI> about the &s;ame
time. He pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome weeks at Stoke, near Wind&s;or,
where his mother and aunt re&s;ided, and in that plea&s;ing
retirement fini&s;hed &s;everal of his mo&s;t celebrated
Poems.</P>
<P>From thence he returned to Cambridge, which,
from this period, was his chief re&s;idence during the
remainder of his life. The conveniencies with which
a college life was attended, to a per&s;on of his narrow
fortune, and &s;tudious turn of mind, were more than
a compen&s;ation for the di&s;like which, for &s;everal rea|&s;ons,
he bore to the place: but he was perfectly re|conciled
to his &s;ituation, on Mr. Ma&s;on's being elected
a fellow of Pembroke-Hall; a circum&s;tance which
brought him a companion, who, during life, re|tained
for him the highest degree of friend&s;hip and
e&s;teem.</P>
<P>In 1742 he was admittted to the degree of Batchelor
in the Civil Law, as appears from a letter written to
his particular friend Dr. Wharton, of Old Park,
near Durham, formerly fellow of Pembroke Hall,
Cambridge, in which he ridicules, with much point
and humour, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">lies and foibles, and the dullne&s;s
and formality, which prevailed in the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>In order to enrich his mind with the ideas of others,
he devoted a con&s;iderable portion of his time to the
&s;tudy of the be&s;t Greek authors; &s;o that, in the cour&s;e
or &s;ix years, there were hardly any writers of emi|nence
in that language who&s;e works he had not only
read, but thoroughly dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>His attention, however, to the Greek cla&s;&s;ics, did
not wholly engro&s;s his time; for he found lei&s;ure
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
to advert, in a new &s;arca&s;tical manner, to the igno|rance
and dullne&s;s with which he was &s;urrounded,
though &s;ituated in the centre of learning. There is
only a fragment remaining of what he had written on
this &s;ubject, from which it may be inferred, that it
was intended as an <HI>Hymn to Ignorance.</HI> The fragment
is wholly introductory; yet many of the lines are &s;o
pointed in &s;ignification, and harmonious in ver&s;ifica|tion,
that they will be admitted, by the admirers of
ver&s;e, to di&s;play his poetical talents with more bril|liancy
than appears in many of his lyric productions.</P>

<P><PB N="x" REF="9">
In 1744 he &s;eems to have given up his attention to
the Mu&s;es. Mr. Walpole, de&s;irous of pre&s;erving
what he had already written, as well as perpetuating
the merit of their decea&s;ed friend, We&s;t, endea|voured
to prevail with Gray, to whom he had previ|ou&s;ly
become reconciled, to publi&s;h his own Poems,
together with tho&s;e of We&s;t; but Gray declined it,
conceiving their productions united would not &s;uffice
to fill even a &s;mall volume.</P>
<P>In 1747 Gray became acquainted with Mr. Ma&s;on,
then a &s;cholar of St. John's College, and afterwards
Fellow of Pembroke Hall. Mr. Ma&s;on, who was
a man of great learning and ingenuity, had written,
the year before, his "Monody on the Death of Pope,"
and his "II Bellico&s;o," and "Il Pacifico;" and Gray
revi&s;ed the&s;e pieces at the reque&s;t of a friend. This
laid the foundation of a friend&s;hip that terminated
but with life: and Mr. Ma&s;on, after the death of
Gray, te&s;tified his regard for him, by &s;uperintending
the publication of his works.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year he wrote a little Ode on the Death
of a favourite Cat of Mr. Walpole's, in which hu|mour
and in&s;truction are happily blended: but the fol|lowing
year he produced an effort of much more im|portance;
the Fragment of an <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Alliance of
Education and Government.</HI> Its tendency was to de|mon&s;trate
the nece&s;&s;ary concurrence of both to form
great and u&s;eful Men. It opens with the two follow|ing
&s;imilies. The exordium is rather uncommon;
but he &s;eems to have adopted it as a kind of clue to
the &s;ubject he meant to pur&s;ue in the &s;ub&s;equent part
of the Poem.</P>

<P>It is much to be lamented that our Author did not
fini&s;h what was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully begun, as the Fragment
is deemed &s;uperior to every thing in the &s;ame &s;tyle of
writing which our language can boa&s;t.</P>
<P>In 1750 he put his fini&s;hing &s;troke to his <HI>Elegy writ|ten
in a Country Church-yard,</HI> which was communi|cated
first to his friend Mr. Walpole, and by him to
many per&s;ons of rank and di&s;tinction. This beauti|ful
production introduced the author to the favour of
Lady Cobham, and gave occa&s;ion to a &s;ingular compo|&s;ition,
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
called, <HI>A Long Story</HI>; in which various effu|&s;ions
of wit and humour are very happily inter&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Elegy having found its way into the "Maga|zine
of Magazines," the Author wrote to Mr. Wal|pole,
reque&s;ting he would put it into the hands of Mr.
Dod&s;ley, and order him to print it immediately, in
order to re&s;cue it from the di&s;grace it might have in|curred
by its appearance in a Magazine. The Elegy
was the mo&s;t popular of all our Author's productions;
it ran through eleven editions, and was tran&s;lated
into Latin by An&s;tey and Roberts; and in the &s;ame
year a ver&s;ion of it was publi&s;hed by Lloyd. Mr.
Bentley, an eminent Arti&s;t of that time, wi&s;hing to
decorate this elegant compo&s;ition with every ornament
of which it is so highly de&s;erving, drew for it a set of
de&s;igns, as he al&s;o did for the re&s;t of Gray's
produc|tions,
for which the arti&s;t was liberally repaid by the
Author in &s;ome beautiful Stanzas, but unfortunately
no perfect copy of them remains. The following,
however, are given as a &s;pecimen:

<P>It appears, by a letter to Dr. Wharton, that Gray
fini&s;hed his Ode on the <HI>Progre&s;s of Poetry</HI> early in 1755.
The <HI>Bard</HI> al&s;o was begun about the &s;ame time; and
the following beautiful Fragment on the <HI>Plea&s;ure ari|&s;ing
from Vici&s;&s;itude</HI> the next year. The merit of the
two former pieces was not immediately perceived, nor
generally acknowledged. Garrick wrote a few lines
in their prai&s;e. Lloyd and Colman wrote, in concert,
two Odes to "Oblivion" and "Ob&s;curity," in which
they were ridiculed with much ingenuity.</P>

</LG> </Q>
<P>Our Author's reputation, as a Poet, was &s;o high,
that, on the death of Colley Cibber, in 1757, he had
the honour of refu&s;ing the office of Poet-Laureat, to
which he was probably induced by the di&s;grace brought
upon it through the inability of &s;ome who had filled it.</P>
<P>His curio&s;ity &s;ome time after drew him away from
Cambridge to a lodging near the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum,
where he re&s;ided near three years, reading and tran|&s;cribing.</P>
<P>In 1762, on the death of Mr. Turner, Profe&s;&s;or
of Modern Languages and Hi&s;tory at Cambridge, he
was, according to his own expre&s;&s;ion, "cockered and
&s;pirited up" to apply to Lord Bute for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
His Lord&s;hip refu&s;ed him with all the politene&s;s of a
courtier, the office having been previou&s;ly promi&s;ed to
Mr. Brocket, the tutor of Sir James Lowther.</P>
<P>His health being on the decline, in 1765 he under|took
a journey to Scotland, conceiving he &s;hould de|rive
benefit from exerci&s;e and change of &s;ituation.
His account of that country, as far as it extends, is
curious and elegant; for as his mind was comprehen|&s;ive,
it was employed in the contemplation of all the
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
works of art, all the appearances of nature, and all
the monuments of pa&s;t events.</P>
<P>During his &s;tay in Scotland, he contracted a friend|&s;hip
with Dr. Beattie, in whom he found, as he him|&s;elf
expre&s;&s;es it, a poet, a philo&s;opher, and a good
man. Through the intervention of his friend the
Doctor, the Mari&s;chal College at Aberdeen offered
him the degree of Doctor of Laws, which he thought
it decent to decline, having omitted to take it at
Cambridge.</P>
<P>In December, 1767, Dr. Beattie, &s;till de&s;irous that
his country &s;hould leave a memento of its regard to
the merit of our Poet, &s;olicited his permi&s;&s;ion to
print, at the Univer&s;ity of Gla&s;gow, an elegant edi|tion
of his works. Gray could not comply with his
friend's reque&s;t, as he had given his promi&s;e to Mr.
Dod&s;ley. However, as a compliment to them both,
he pre&s;ented them with a copy, containing a few
notes, and the imitations of the old Norwegian poetry,
intended to &s;upplant the Long Story, which was printed
at fir&s;t to illu&s;trate Mr. Bentley's de&s;igns.</P>
<P>In 1768 our Author obtained that office without
&s;olicitation, for which he had before applied without
effect. The Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of Languages and Hi&s;tory
again became vacant, and he received an offer of it
from the Duke of Grafton, who had &s;ucceeded Lord
Bute in office. The place was valuable in it&s;elf, the
&s;alary being 400l. a year; but it was rendered peculi|arly
acceptable to Mr. Gray, as he obtained it with|out
&s;olicitation.</P>
<P>Soon after he &s;ucceeded to this office, the impaired
&s;tate of his health rendered another journey nece&s;&s;ary;
and he vi&s;ited, in 1769, the counties of We&s;tmoreland
and Cumberland. His remarks on the wonderful
&s;cenery which the&s;e northern regions di&s;play, he tran&s;|mitted
in epi&s;tolary journals to his friend, Dr. Whar|ton,
which abound, according to Mr. Ma&s;on's elegant
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
diction, with all the wildne&s;s of Salvator, and the
&s;oftne&s;s of Claude.</P>
<P>He appears to have been much affected by the anxiety
he felt at holding a place without di&s;charging the du|ties
annexed to it. He had always de&s;igned reading
lectures, but never put it in practice; and a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
of this neglect contributed not a little to in|crea&s;e
the malady under which he had long laboured:
nay, the office at length became &s;o irk&s;ome, that he
&s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;ed to re&s;ign it.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of May, 1771, he removed from
Cambridge to London, after having &s;uffered violent
attacks of an hereditary gout, to which he had long
been &s;ubject, notwith&s;tanding he had ob&s;erved the mo&s;t
rigid ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s throughout the whole cour&s;e of
his life. By the advice of his phy&s;icians, he removed
from London to Ken&s;ington; the air of which place
proved &s;o &s;alutary, that he was &s;oon enabled to return
to Cambridge, whence he de&s;igned to make a vi&s;it to
his friend Dr. Wharton, at Old Park, near Durham;
indulging a fond hope that the excur&s;ion would tend
to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his health: but, alas! that
hope proved delu&s;ive. On the 24th of July he was
&s;eized, while at dinner in the College hall, with a &s;ud|den
nau&s;ea, which obliged him to retire to his cham|ber.
The gout had fixed on his &s;tomach in &s;uch a
degree as to re&s;i&s;t all the powers of medicine. On the
29th he was attacked with a &s;trong convul&s;ion, which
returned with increa&s;ed violence the en&s;uing day; and
on the evening of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t of May, 177<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, he departed
this life in the 55th year of his age.</P>
<P>From the narrative of his friend, Mr. Ma&s;on, it
appears, that Gray was actuated by motives of &s;elf
improvement, and &s;elf gratification, in his application
to the Mu&s;es, rather than any view to pecuniary emo|lument.
His pur&s;uits were in general di&s;intere&s;ted;
and as he was free from avarice on the one hand, &s;o
was he from extravagance on the other; being one of
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
tho&s;e few characters in the annals of literature, e&s;pe|cially
in the poetical cla&s;s, who are devoid of &s;elf in|tere&s;t,
and at the &s;ame time attentive to economy; but
Mr. Ma&s;on adds, that he was induced to decline tak|ing
any advantage of his literary productions by a de|gree
of pride, which influenced him to di&s;dain the idea
of being thought an author by profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It appears, from the &s;ame narrative, that Gray
made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the &s;tudy of architecture,
particularly the gothic. He endeavoured to trace this
branch of the &s;cience, from the period of its com|mencement,
through its various changes, till it ar|rived
at its perfection in the time of Henry VIII.
He applied him&s;elf al&s;o to the &s;tudy of heraldry, of
which he obtained a very competent knowledge, as
appears from his <HI>Remarks on Saxon Churches,</HI> in the
introduction to Mr. Bentham's <HI>Hi&s;tory of Ely.</HI></P>
<P>But the favourite &s;tudy of Gray, for the la&s;t two
years of his life, was natural hi&s;tory, which he rather
re&s;umed than began, as he had acquired &s;ome know|ledge
of botany in early life, while he was under the
tuition of his uncle Antrobus. He wrote copious
marginal notes to the works of Linnaeus, and other
writers in the three kingdoms of nature: and Mr.
Ma&s;on further ob&s;erves, that, excepting pure mathe|matics,
and the &s;tudies dependent on that &s;cience,
there was hardly any part of human learning in which
he had not acquired a competent &s;kill; in mo&s;t of them
a con&s;ummate ma&s;tery.</P>
<P>Mr. Ma&s;on has declined drawing any formal charac|ter
of him; but has adopted one from a letter to
James Bo&s;well, E&s;q. by the Rev. Mr. Temple, Rec|tor
of St. Gluvias, in Cornwall, fir&s;t printed anony|mou&s;ly
in the London Magazine, which, as we con|ceive
authentic, from the &s;anction of Mr. Ma&s;on, we
&s;hall therefore tran&s;cribe.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Perhaps he was the mo&s;t learned man in Europe.
He was equally acquainted with the elegant and pro|found
parts of &s;cience, and that not &s;uperficially, but
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
thoroughly. He knew every branch of hi&s;tory, both
natural and civil; had read all the original hi&s;torians
of England, France, and Italy; and was a great anti|quarian.
Critici&s;m, metaphy&s;ics, morals, and politics,
made a principal part of his &s;tudy; voyages and tra|vels
of all &s;orts were his favourite amu&s;ements; and
he had a fine ta&s;te in painting, prints, architecture,
and gardening. With &s;uch a fund of knowledge, his
conver&s;ation mu&s;t have been equally in&s;tructive and
entertaining; but he was al&s;o a good man, a man of
virtue and humanity. There is no character without
&s;ome &s;peck, &s;ome imperfection; and I think the greate&s;t
defect in his was an affectation in delicacy, or rather
effeminacy, and a vi&s;ible fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s, or contempt and
di&s;dain of his inferiors in &s;cience. He al&s;o had, in
&s;ome degree, that weakne&s;s which di&s;gu&s;ted Voltaire
&s;o much in Mr. Congreve: though he &s;eemed to value
others chiefly according to the progre&s;s they had made
in knowledge, yet he could not bear to be con&s;idered
him&s;elf merely as a man of letters; and though with|out
birth, or fortune, or &s;tation, his de&s;ire was to be
looked upon as a private independent gentleman, who
read for his amu&s;ement. Perhaps it may be &s;aid, What
&s;ignifies &s;o much knowledge, when it produced &s;o little?
Is it worth taking &s;o much pains to leave no memorial
but a few Poems? But let it be con&s;idered that Mr.
Gray was, to others, at lea&s;t innocently employed;
to him&s;elf, certainly beneficially. His time pa&s;&s;ed
agreeably; he was every day making &s;ome new ac|qui&s;ition
in &s;cience; his mind was enlarged, his heart
&s;oftened, his virtue &s;trengthened; the world and man|kind
were &s;hewn to him without a ma&s;k; and he was
taught to con&s;ider every thing as trifling, and unworthy
of the attention of a wi&s;e man, except the pur&s;uit of
knowledge and practice of virtue, in that &s;tate wherein
God hath placed us.</Q></P>
<P>In addition to this character, Mr. Ma&s;on has re|marked,
that Gray's effeminacy was affected mo&s;t
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
before tho&s;e whom he did not wi&s;h to plea&s;e; and that
he is unju&s;tly charged with making knowledge his
&s;ole rea&s;on of preference, as he paid his e&s;teem to none
whom he did not likewi&s;e believe to be good.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on makes the following ob&s;ervations:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">What has occurred to me, from the &s;light in&s;pection
of his letters, in which my undertaking has engaged
me, is, that his mind had a large gra&s;p; that his
curio&s;ity was unlimited, and his judgment cultivated;
that he was a man likely to love much where he loved
at all, but that he was fa&s;tidious, and hard to plea&s;e.
His contempt, however, is often employed, where I
hope it will be approved, upon &s;ceptici&s;m and in&s;ide|lity.
His &s;hort account of Shafte&s;bury I will in&s;ert.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">You &s;ay you cannot conceive how lord Sha&s;te&s;|bury
came to be a philo&s;opher in vogue; I will tell
you: fir&s;t, he was a lord; &s;econdly, he was as vain
as any of his readers; thirdly, men are very prone to
believe what they do not under&s;tand; fourthly, they
will believe any thing at all, provided they are under
no obligation to believe it; fifthly, they love to take
a new road, even when that road leads no where;
&s;ixthly, he was reckoned a fine writer, and &s;eems al|ways
to mean more than he &s;aid. Would you have
any more rea&s;ons? An interval of above forty years has
pretty well de&s;troyed the charm. A dead lord ranks
with commoners: vanity is no longer intere&s;ted in the
matter; for a new road is become an old one.</Q></P>
<P>As a writer he had this peculiarity, that he did not
write his pieces fir&s;t rudely, and then correct them,
but laboured every line as it aro&s;e in the train of com|po&s;ition;
and he had a notion not very peculiar, that
he could not write but at certain times, or at happy
moments; a fanta&s;tic foppery, to which our kindne&s;s
for a man of learning and of virtue wi&s;hes him to
have been &s;uperior.</P>
<P>As a Poet he &s;tands high in the e&s;timation of the
candid and judicious. His works are not numerous;
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
but they bear the marks of inten&s;e application, and
careful revi&s;ion. The Elegy in the Churchyard is
deemed his ma&s;ter-piece; the &s;ubject is intere&s;ting, the
&s;entiment &s;imple and pathetic, and the ver&s;ification
charmingly melodious. This beautiful compo&s;ition
has been often &s;elected by orators for the di&s;play of
their rhetorical talents. But as the mo&s;t fini&s;hed pro|ductions
of the human mind have not e&s;caped cen&s;ure,
the works of our Author have undergone illiberal
comments. His Elegy has been &s;uppo&s;ed defective in
want of plan. Dr. Knox, in his E&s;&s;ays, has ob|&s;erved,
<Q REND="inline">that it is thought by &s;ome to be no more
than a confu&s;ed heap of &s;plendid ideas, thrown toge|ther
without order and without proportion.</Q> Some
pa&s;&s;ages have been cen&s;ured by Kelly in the <HI>Babbler</HI>;
and imitations of different authors have been pointed
out by other critics. But the&s;e imitations cannot be
a&s;certained, as there are numberle&s;s in&s;tances of coin|cidence
of ideas; &s;o that it is difficult to &s;ay, with pre|ci&s;ion,
what is or is not a de&s;igned or accidental imitation.</P>
<P>Gray, in his Elegy in the Church-yard, has great
merit in adverting to the mo&s;t intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ions of
the human mind; yet his genius is not marked alone
by the tender &s;en&s;ibility &s;o con&s;picuous in that elegant
piece; but there is a &s;ublimity which gives it an equal
claim to univer&s;al admiration.</P>
<P>His Odes on <HI>The Progre&s;s of Poetry,</HI> and of <HI>The
Bard,</HI> according to Mr. Ma&s;on's account, <Q REND="inline">breathe
the high &s;pirit of lyric enthu&s;ia&s;m. The tran&s;itions
are &s;udden and impetuous; the language full of fire
and force; and the imagery carried, without impro|priety,
to the mo&s;t daring height. They have been
accu&s;ed of ob&s;curity: but the one can be ob&s;cure to
tho&s;e only who have not read Pindar; and the other
only to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the hi&s;tory of
our own nation.</Q></P>
<P>Of his other lyric pieces, Mr. Wakefield, a learned
and ingenious commentator, ob&s;erves, that, though,
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
like all other human productions, they are not with|out
their defects, yet the &s;pirit of poetry, and exqui|&s;ite
charms of the ver&s;e, are more then a compen&s;ation
for tho&s;e defects. The Ode on <HI>Eton College</HI> abounds
with &s;entiments natural, and con&s;onant to the feelings
of humanity, exhibited with per&s;picuity of method,
and in elegant, intelligible, and expre&s;&s;ive language.
The Sonnet on <HI>the Death of We&s;t,</HI> and the Epitaph on
Sir <HI>William Williams,</HI> are as perfect compo&s;itions of
the kind as any in our language.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on was confe&s;&s;edly a man of great genius;
but the partial and uncandid mode of critici&s;m he
has adopted in his remarks on the writings of Gray,
has given to liberal minds great and ju&s;t offence. Ac|cording
to Mr. Ma&s;on's account, he has &s;ubjected
Gray's poetry to the mo&s;t rigorous examination. De|clining
all con&s;ideration of the general plan and con|duct
of the pieces, he has confined him&s;elf &s;olely to
&s;trictures on words and forms of expre&s;&s;ion; and Mr.
Ma&s;on very pertinently adds, that <HI>verbal</HI> critici&s;m is
an ordeal which the mo&s;t perfect compo&s;ition cannot
pa&s;s without injury.</P>
<P>He has al&s;o fallen under Mr. Wakefield's &s;evere&s;t
cen&s;ure. This commentator affirms, that <Q REND="inline">he thinks
a refutation of his &s;trictures upon Gray a nece&s;&s;ary
&s;ervice to the public, without which they might ope|rate
with a malignant influence upon the national ta&s;te.
His cen&s;ure, however, is too general, and expre&s;&s;ed
with too much vehemence; and his remarks betray,
upon the whole, an unrea&s;onable fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s of ta&s;te,
and an unbecoming illiberality of &s;pirit. He appears
to have turned an unwilling eye upon the beauties of
Gray, becau&s;e his jealou&s;y would not &s;uffer him to
&s;ee &s;uch &s;uperlative merit in a cotemporary.</Q> The&s;e
remarks of Mr. Wakefield appear to be well founded;
and it has been ob&s;erved, by another writer, that
Dr. John&s;on, being &s;trongly influenced by his politi|cal
and religious principles, was inclined to treat with
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
the utmo&s;t &s;everity &s;ome of the productions of our
be&s;t writers; to which may be imputed that &s;everity
with which he cen&s;ures the lyric performances of Gray.
It is highly probable that no one poetical reader will
univer&s;ally &s;ub&s;cribe to his deci&s;ions, though all may
admire his va&s;t intuitive knowledge, and power of
di&s;crimination.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t copy of this exqui&s;ite Poem, Mr. Ma&s;on
ob&s;erves, the conclu&s;ion was different from that which
the Author afterwards compo&s;ed; and though his
after-thought was unque&s;tionably the be&s;t, yet there
is a pathetic melancholy in the four &s;tanzas that were
rejected, following, "With incen&s;e kindled at the
Mu&s;es' flame," which highly claim pre&s;ervation.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>The thoughtle&s;s wor'd to Maje&s;ty may bow,</L>
<L>Exalt the brave, and idolize &s;ucce&s;s;</L>
<L>But more to innocence their &s;afety owe,</L>
<L>Than pow'r or genius e'er con&s;pir'd to ble&s;s.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>And thou who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,</L>
<L>Du&s;t in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e notes their artle&s;s tale relate,</L>
<L>By night and lonely contemplation led,</L>
<L>To wander in the gloomy walks of fate,</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Hark! how the &s;acred calm, that breathes around,</L>
<L>Bids every fierce tumultuous pa&s;&s;ion. cea&s;e;</L>
<L>In &s;till &s;mall accents whi&s;pering from the ground,</L>
<L>A grateful earne&s;t of eternal peace.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>No more, with rea&s;on and thy&s;elf at &s;trife,</L>

</LG></Q>
<P>In one in&s;tance, the Doctor's incon&s;i&s;tency, and de|viation
from his general character, does him honour.
After having commented with the mo&s;t rigid &s;everity
on the poetical works of Gray, as it con&s;cious of the
inju&s;tice done him, he &s;eems to apologize by the fol|lowing
declaration, which concludes his Critici&s;m, and
&s;hall conclude the Memoirs of our Author.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">In the character of his Elegy (&s;ays John&s;on) I
rejoice and concur with the common reader; for, by
the common &s;en&s;e of readers, uncorrupted with literary
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23">
prejudices, after all the refinements of &s;ubtilty, and
the dogmati&s;m of learning, mu&s;t be finally decided all
claim to poetical honours. The <HI>Church-yard</HI> abounds
with images which find a mirror in every mind, and
with &s;entiments to which every bo&s;om returns an echo.
The four &s;tanzas beginning, <HI>Yet e'en the&s;e bones</HI> are
to me original; I have never &s;een the notions in any
other place; yet he that reads them here, per&s;uades
him&s;elf that he has always felt them. Had Gray
written often thus, it had been vain to blame, and
u&s;ele&s;s to prai&s;e him.</Q></P>

Brian, King of Dublin. The Earl and all his Forces were cut to Pieces, and
Sigtryg was in Danger of a total Defeat; but the Enemy had a greater Lo&s;s
