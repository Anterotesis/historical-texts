<HEAD>THE CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>SECT. I. Mathematicians pre&s;umed to be the great Ma&s;ters of Rea&s;on. Hence an undue deference to their deci&s;ions where they have no right to decide. This one Cau&s;e of Infidelity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. II. Their Principles and Methods to be exa|mined with the &s;ame freedom, which they a&s;&s;ume with regard to the Principles and My&s;teries of Religion. In what Sen&s;e and how far Geometry is to be allowed an Improvement of the Mind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. III. Fluxions the great Object and Employment of the profound Geometricians in the pre|&s;ent Age. What the&s;e Fluxions are.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. IV. Moments or na&s;cent Increments of flowing Quantities difficult to conceive. Fluxions of different Orders. Second and third Fluxions ob&s;cure My&s;teries.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="3">
SECT. V. Differences, <HI>i. e.</HI> Increments or Decre|ments infinitely &s;mall, u&s;ed by foreign Ma|thematicians in&s;tead of Fluxions or Velo|cities of na&s;cent and evane&s;cent Incre|ments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. VI. Differences of various Orders, <HI>i. e.</HI> Quan|tities infinitely le&s;s than Quantities infi|nitely little; and infinite&s;imal Parts of infinite&s;imals of in&s;inite&s;imals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without end or limit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. VII. My&s;teries in faith unju&s;tly objected again&s;t by tho&s;e who admit them in Science.</ITEM>

<ITEM>SECT. IX. Method for finding the Fluxion of a Rect|angle of two indeterminate Quantities, &s;hewed to be illegitimate and fal&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. X. Implicit Deference of Mathematicalmen for the great Author of Fluxions. Their earne&s;tne&s;s rather to go on fa&s;t and far, than to &s;et out warily and &s;ee their way di&s;tinctly.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="4">
SECT. XI. Momentums difficult to comprehend. No middle Quantity to be admitted between a finite Quantity and nothing, without admitting Infinite&s;imals.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XII. The Fluxion of any Power of a flowing Quantity. Lemma premi&s;ed in order to examine the method for finding &s;uch Fluxion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XIII. The rule for the Fluxions of Powers attained by unfair rea&s;oning.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XIV. The afore&s;aid rea&s;oning farther unfold|ed and &s;hew'd to be illogical.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XV. No true Conclu&s;ion to be ju&s;tly drawn by direct con&s;equence from incon&s;i&s;tent Sup|po&s;itions. The &s;ame Rules of right rea|&s;on to be ob&s;erved, whether Men argue in Symbols or in Words.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XVI. An Hypothe&s;is being de&s;troyed, no con&s;e|quence of &s;uch Hypothe&s;is to be retained.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XVII. Hard to di&s;tingui&s;h between evane&s;cent Increments and infinite&s;imal Differences. Fluxions placed in various Lights. The great Author, it &s;eems, not &s;atisfied with his own Notions.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="5">
SECT. XVIII. Quantities infinitely &s;mall &s;uppo&s;ed and rejected by <HI>Leibnitz</HI> and his Followers. No Quantity, according to them, greater or &s;maller for the Addition or Subduc|tion of its Infinite&s;imal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXIX. Conclu&s;ions to be proved by the Princi|ples, and not Principles by the Conclu&s;ions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XX. The Geometrical Analy&s;t con&s;idered as a Logician; and his Di&s;coveries, not in them&s;elves, but as derived from &s;uch Principles and by &s;uch Inferences.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXI. A Tangent drawn to the Parabola ac|cording to the <HI>calculus differentialis.</HI> Truth &s;hewn to be the re&s;ult of error, and how.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXII. By virtue of a twofold mi&s;take Ana|ly&s;ts arrive at Truth, but not at Science: ignorant how they come at their own Conclu&s;ions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXIII. The Conclu&s;ion never evident or accu|rate, in virtue of ob&s;cure or inaccurate Premi&s;es. Finite Quantities might be rejected as well as Infinite&s;imals.</ITEM>

<ITEM><PB REF="6">
SECT. XXV. Sundry Ob&s;ervations thereupon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXVI. Ordinate found from the Area by means of evane&s;cent Increments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXVII. In the foregoing Ca&s;e the &s;uppo&s;ed evane&s;cent Increment is really a finite Quantity, de&s;troyed by an equal Quantity with an oppo&s;ite Sign.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXVIII. The foregoing Ca&s;e put generally. Algebraical Expre&s;&s;ions compared with Geometrical Quantities.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXIX. Corre&s;pondent Quantities Algebraical and Geometrical equated. The Analy&s;is &s;hewed not to obtain in Infinte&s;imals, but it mu&s;t al&s;o obtain in finite Quantities.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXX. The getting rid of Quantities by the received Principles, whether of Fluxions or of Differences, neither good Geometry nor good Logic. Fluxions or Velocities, why introduced.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXXI. Velocities not to be ab&s;tracted from Time and Space: Nor their Proportions to be inve&s;tigated or con&s;idered exclu&s;ively of Time and Space.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="7">
SECT. XXXII. Difficult and ob&s;cure Points con&s;titute the Principles of the modern Analy&s;is, and are the Foundation on which it is built.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXXIII. The rational Faculties whether im|proved by &s;uch ob&s;cure Analytics.</ITEM>

<ITEM>SECT. XXXVIII. Fluxions, whether the Velocities with which infinite&s;imal Differences are generated?</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XXXIX. Fluxions of Fluxions or &s;econd Fluxions, whether to be conceived as Velo|cities of Velocities, or rather as Velocities of the &s;econd na&s;cent Increments?</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="8">
SECT. XL. Fluxions con&s;idered, &s;ometimes in one Sen&s;e, &s;ometimes in another: One while in them&s;elves, another in their Exponents: Hence Confu&s;ion and Ob&s;curity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECT. XLI. I&s;ochronal Increments, whether finite or na&s;cent, proportional to their re&s;pective Velocities.</ITEM>

<P>I. _THOUGH I am a Stranger to your Per&s;on, yet I am not, Sir, a Stranger to the Repu|tation you have acquired, in that branch of Learning which hath been your peculiar Study; nor to the Authority that you therefore a&s;&s;ume in things foreign to your Profe&s;&s;ion, nor to the Abu&s;e that you, and too many more of the like Cha|racter, are known to make of &s;uch undue Authority, to the mi&s;leading of unwary Per&s;ons in matters of the highe&s;t Con|cernment, and whereof your mathemati|cal Knowledge can by no means qualify you to be a competent Judge. Equity in|deed and good Sen&s;e would incline one to di&s;regard the Judgment of Men, in Points
<PB N="4" REF="11">
which they have not con&s;idered or exami|ned. But &s;everal who make the loude&s;t Claim to tho&s;e Qualities, do, neverthele&s;s, the very thing they would &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e, clothing them&s;elves in the Livery of other Mens Opinions, and putting on a general deference for the Judgment of you, Gen|tlemen, who are pre&s;umed to be of all Men the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters of Rea&s;on, to be mo&s;t conver&s;ant about di&s;tinct Ideas, and never to take things upon tru&s;t, but al|ways clearly to &s;ee your way, as Men who&s;e con&s;tant Employment is the de|ducing Truth by the ju&s;te&s;t inference from the mo&s;t evident Principles. With this bias on their Minds, they &s;ubmit to your Deci&s;ions where you have no right to de|cide. And that this is one &s;hort way of making Infidels I am credibly informed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>II. Whereas then it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that you apprehend more di&s;tinctly, con&s;ider more clo&s;ely, infer more ju&s;tly, conclude more accurately than other Men, and that you are therefore le&s;s religious becau&s;e more judicious, I &s;hall claim the privilege of a Free-Thinker; and take the Liberty
<PB N="5" REF="12">
to inquire into the Object, Principles, and Method of Demon&s;tration admitted by the Mathematicians of the pre&s;ent Age, with the &s;ame freedom that you pre&s;ume to treat the Principles and My&s;teries of Reli|gion; to the end, that all Men may &s;ee what right you have to lead, or what En|couragement others have to follow you. It hath been an old remark that Geome|try is an excellent Logic. And it mu&s;t be owned, that when the Definitions are clear; when the Po&s;tulata cannot be refu&s;ed, nor the Axioms denied; when from the di&s;|tinct Contemplation and Compari&s;on of Figures, their Properties are derived, by a perpetual well-connected chain of Con&s;e|quences, the Objects being &s;till kept in view, and the attention ever fixed upon them; there is acquired an habit of rea|&s;oning, clo&s;e and exact and methodical: which habit &s;trengthens and &s;harpens the Mind, and being transferred to other Subjects, is of general u&s;e in the inquiry after Truth. But how far this is the ca&s;e of our Geometrical Analy&s;ts, it may be worth while to con&s;ider.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="6" REF="13">
<P>III. The Method of Fluxions is the ge|neral Key, by help whereof the modern Mathematicians unlock the &s;ecrets of Geo|metry, and con&s;equently of Nature. And as it is that which hath enabled them &s;o remarkably to outgo the Ancients in di&s;|covering Theorems and &s;olving Problems, the exerci&s;e and application thereof is be|come the main, if not &s;ole, employment of all tho&s;e who in this Age pa&s;s for pro|found Geometers. But whether this Me|thod be clear or ob&s;cure, con&s;i&s;tent or repugnant, demon&s;trative or precarious, as I &s;hall inquire with the utmo&s;t impar|tiality, &s;o I &s;ubmit my inquiry to your own Judgment, and that of every candid Reader. Lines are &s;uppo&s;ed to be gene|rated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introd. ad Quadraturam Curvarum.</NOTE> by the motion of Points, Plains by the motion of Lines, and Solids by the motion of Plains. And whereas Quan|tities generated in equal times are greater or le&s;&s;er, according to the greater or le&s;&s;er Velocity, wherewith they increa&s;e and are generated, a Method hath been found to determine Quantities from the Velocities of their generating Motions.
<PB N="7" REF="14">
And &s;uch Velocities are called Fluxions: and the Quantities generated are called flowing Quantities. The&s;e Fluxions are &s;aid to be nearly as the Increments of the flowing Quantities, generated in the lea&s;t equal Particles of time; and to be accurately in the fir&s;t Proportion of the na&s;cent, or in the la&s;t of the evane&s;cent, Increments. Sometimes, in&s;tead of Velo|cities, the momentaneous Increments or Decrements of undetermined flowing Quantities are con&s;idered, under the Ap|pellation of Moments.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>IV. By Moments we are not to under|&s;tand finite Particles. The&s;e are &s;aid not to be Moments, but Quantities genera|ted from Moments, which la&s;t are only the na&s;cent Principles of finite Quanti|ties. It is &s;aid, that the minute&s;t Errors are not to be neglected in Mathematics: that the Fluxions are Celerities, not pro|portional to the finite Increments though ever &s;o &s;mall; but only to the Moments or na&s;cent Increments, whereof the Pro|portion alone, and not the Magnitude, is con&s;idered. And of the afore&s;aid Fluxions
<PB N="8" REF="15">
there be other Fluxions, which Fluxions of Fluxions are called &s;econd Fluxions. And the Fluxions of the&s;e &s;econd Fluxions are called third Fluxions: and &s;o on, fourth, fifth, &s;ixth, <HI>&amp;c. ad infinitum.</HI> Now as our Sen&s;e is &s;trained and puzzled with the perception of Objects extremely minute, even &s;o the Imagination, which Faculty derives from Sen&s;e, is very much &s;trained and puzzled to frame clear Ideas of the lea&s;t Particles of time, or the lea&s;t Incre|ments generated therein: and much more &s;o to comprehend the Moments, or tho&s;e Increments of the flowing Quanti|ties in <HI>&s;tatu na&s;centi,</HI> in their very fir&s;t origin or beginning to exi&s;t, before they become finite Particles. And it &s;eems &s;till more difficult, to conceive the ab&s;tracted Velocities of &s;uch na&s;cent imperfect En|tities. But the Velocities of the Velocities, the &s;econd, third, fourth and fifth Velo|cities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> exceed, if I mi&s;take not, all Humane Under&s;tanding. The further the Mind analy&s;eth and pur&s;ueth the&s;e fugi|tive Ideas, the more it is lo&s;t and be|wildered; the Objects, at fir&s;t fleeting and minute, &s;oon vani&s;hing out of &s;ight. Cer|tainly
<PB N="9" REF="16">
in any Sen&s;e a &s;econd or third Fluxion &s;eems an ob&s;cure My&s;tery. The incipient Celerity of an incipient Celerity, the na&s;cent Augment of a na&s;cent Aug|ment, <HI>i. e.</HI> of a thing which hath no Magnitude: Take it in which light you plea&s;e, the clear Conception of it will, if I mi&s;take not, be found impo&s;&s;ible, whe|ther it be &s;o or no I appeal to the trial of every thinking Reader. And if a &s;econd Fluxion be inconceivable, what are we to think of third, fourth, fifth Fluxions, and &s;o onward without end?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>V. The foreign Mathematicians are &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, even of our own, to proceed in a manner, le&s;s accurate per|haps and geometrical, yet more intelligi|ble. In&s;tead of flowing Quantities and their Fluxions, they con&s;ider the variable finite Quantities, as increa&s;ing or dimi|ni&s;hing by the continual Addition or Sub|duction of infinitely &s;mall Quantities. In|&s;tead of the Velocities wherewith Incre|ments are generated, they con&s;ider the In|crements or Decrements them&s;elves, which they call Differences, and which are &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="10" REF="17">
to be infinitely &s;mall. The Diffe|rence of a Line is an infinitely little Line; of a Plain an infinitely little Plain. They &s;uppo&s;e finite Quantities to con&s;i&s;t of Parts infinitely little, and Curves to be Poly|gones, whereof the Sides are infinitely lit|tle, which by the Angles they make one with another determine the Curvity of the Line. Now to conceive a Quantity in|finitely &s;mall, that is, infinitely le&s;s than any &s;en&s;ible or imaginable Quantity, or than any the lea&s;t finite Magnitude, is, I confe&s;s, above my Capacity. But to con|ceive a Part of &s;uch infinitely &s;mall Quan|tity, that &s;hall be &s;till infinitely le&s;s than it, and con&s;equently though multiply'd infinitely &s;hall never equal the minute&s;t finite Quantity, is, I &s;u&s;pect, an infinite Difficulty to any Man what&s;oever; and will be allowed &s;uch by tho&s;e who can|didly &s;ay what they think; provided they really think and reflect, and do not take things upon tru&s;t.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>VI. And yet in the <HI>calculus differentialis,</HI> which Method &s;erves to all the &s;ame In|tents and Ends with that of Fluxions,
<PB N="11" REF="18">
our modern Analy&s;ts are not content to con&s;ider only the Differences of finite Quantities: they al&s;o con&s;ider the Diffe|rences of tho&s;e Differences, and the Diffe|rences of the Differences of the fir&s;t Diffe|rences. And &s;o on <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> That is, they con&s;ider Quantities infinitely le&s;s than the lea&s;t di&s;cernible Quantity; and others infinitely le&s;s than tho&s;e infinitely &s;mall ones; and &s;till others infinitely le&s;s than the prece|ding Infinite&s;imals, and &s;o on without end or limit. In&s;omuch that we are to ad|mit an infinite &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Infinite&s;imals, each infinitely le&s;s than the foregoing, and infinitely greater than the following. As there are fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, fourth, fifth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Fluxions, &s;o there are Diffe|rences, fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, fourth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in an infinite Progre&s;&s;ion towards nothing, which you &s;till approach and never arrive at. And (which is mo&s;t &s;trange) although you &s;hould take a Million of Millions of the&s;e Infinite&s;imals, each whereof is &s;up|po&s;ed infinitely greater than &s;ome other real Magnitude, and add them to the lea&s;t given Quantity, it &s;hall be never the bigger. For this is one of the mode&s;t <HI>po&s;tulata</HI> of
<PB N="12" REF="19">
our modern Mathematicians, and is a Cor|ner-&s;tone or Ground-work of their Specu|lations.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<P>VII. All the&s;e Points, I &s;ay, are &s;up|po&s;ed and believed by certain rigorous Ex|actors of Evidence in Religion, Men who pretend to believe no further than they can &s;ee. That Men, who have been con|ver&s;ant only about clear Points, &s;hould with difficulty admit ob&s;cure ones might not &s;eem altogether unaccountable. But he who can dige&s;t a &s;econd or third Fluxi|on, a &s;econd or third Difference, need not, methinks, be &s;queami&s;h about any Point in Divinity. There is a natural Pre&s;ump|tion that Mens Faculties are made alike. It is on this Suppo&s;ition that they attempt to argue and convince one another. What, therefore, &s;hall appear evidently impo&s;&s;i|ble and repugnant to one, may be pre|&s;umed the &s;ame to another. But with what appearance of Rea&s;on &s;hall any Man pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that My&s;teries may not be Objects of Faith, at the &s;ame time that he him&s;elf admits &s;uch ob&s;cure My&s;teries to be the Object of Science?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<PB N="13" REF="20">
<P>VIII. It mu&s;t indeed be acknowledged, the modern Mathematicians do not con&s;i|der the&s;e Points as My&s;teries, but as clear|ly conceived and ma&s;tered by their com|prehen&s;ive Minds. They &s;cruple not to &s;ay, that by the help of the&s;e new Analy|tics they can penetrate into Infinity it &s;elf: That they can even extend their Views be|yond Infinity: that their Art comprehends not only Infinite, but Infinite of Infinite (as they expre&s;s it) or an Infinity of Infinites. But, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions and Preten&s;ions, it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tion|ed whether, as other Men in other Inqui|ries are often deceived by Words or Terms, &s;o they likewi&s;e are not wonderfully de|ceived and deluded by their own peculiar Signs, Symbols, or Species. Nothing is ea&s;ier than to devi&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions or Notations for Fluxions and Infinite&s;imals of the fir&s;t, &s;e|cond, third, fourth and &s;ub&s;equent Orders, proceeding in the &s;ame regular form with|out end or limit x^.. x^.^.. x^&tridot;. x^&quaddot;.<GAP DESC="math"> or <HI>dx. ddx. dddx. ddddx &amp;c.</HI> The&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions in|deed are clear and di&s;tinct, and the Mind finds no difficulty in conceiving them to be continued beyond any a&s;&s;ignable Bounds.
<PB N="14" REF="21">
But if we remove the Veil and look under|neath, if laying a&s;ide the Expre&s;&s;ions we &s;et our &s;elves attentively to con&s;ider the things them&s;elves, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be expre&s;&s;ed or marked thereby, we &s;hall di&s;cover much Emptine&s;s, Darkne&s;s, and Confu&s;ion; nay, if I mi&s;take not, direct Impo&s;&s;ibilities and Contradictions. Whe|ther this be the ca&s;e or no, every think|ing Reader is intreated to examine and judge for him&s;elf.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<P>IX. Having con&s;idered the Object, I proceed to con&s;ider the Principles of this new Analy&s;is by Momentums, Fluxions, or Infinite&s;imals; wherein if it &s;hall appear that your capital Points, upon which the re&s;t are &s;uppo&s;ed to depend, include Er|ror and fal&s;e Rea&s;oning; it will then fol|low that you, who are at a lo&s;s to con|duct your &s;elves, cannot with any decen|cy &s;et up for guides to other Men. The main Point in the method of Fluxions is to obtain the Fluxion or Momentum of the Rectangle or Product of two indeter|minate Quantities. Ina&s;much as from thence are derived Rules for obtaining the
<PB N="15" REF="22">
Fluxions of all other Products and Pow|ers; be the Coefficients or the Indexes what they will, integers or fractions, rational or &s;urd.

<P>XI. The Points or meer Limits of na&s;|cent Lines are undoubtedly equal, as hav|ing no more magnitude one than ano|ther, a Limit as &s;uch being no Quantity.

<P>XII. From the foregoing Principle &s;o demon&s;trated, the general Rule for find|ing the Fluxion of any Power of a flow|ing Quantity is derived <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;ophiae naturalis principia Mathematica, lib. 2. lem. 2.</NOTE>.

<P>XIV. To make this Point plainer, I &s;hall unfold the rea&s;oning, and propo&s;e it in a fuller light to your View. It amounts therefore to this, or may in other Words be thus expre&s;&s;ed. I &s;uppo&s;e that the Quantity <HI>x</HI> flows, and by flowing is in|crea&s;ed, and its Increment I call <HI>o,</HI> &s;o that by flowing it becomes <HI>x</HI> &plus; <HI>o.</HI> And as <HI>x</HI> increa&s;eth, it follows that every Power of <HI>x</HI> is likewi&s;e increa&s;ed in a due Pro|portion.
<PB N="22" REF="29">
Therefore as <HI>x</HI> becomes <HI>x</HI> &plus; <HI>o, x^n</HI> will become <GAP DESC="math">: that is, accord|ing to the Method of infinite Series, <HI>x^n</HI> &plus; <HI>nox^n</HI>^&minus;^1 &plus; <GAP DESC="math"><HI>oox^n</HI>^&minus;^2 &plus; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if from the two augmented Quantities we &s;ubduct the Root and the Power re&s;pec|tively, we &s;hall have remaining the two Increments, to wit, <HI>o</HI> and <HI>nox^n</HI>^&minus;^1 &plus; <GAP DESC="math"><HI>oox^n</HI>^&minus;^2 &plus; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Increments, being both divided by the common Divi|&s;or <HI>o,</HI> yield the Quotients 1 and <HI>nx^n</HI>^&minus;^1 &plus; <GAP DESC="math"><HI>ox^n</HI>^&minus;^2 &plus; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are there|fore Exponents of the Ratio of the Incre|ments. Hitherto I have &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>x</HI> flows, that <HI>x</HI> hath a real Increment, that <HI>o</HI> is &s;omething. And I have proceeded all along on that Suppo&s;ition, without which I &s;hould not have been able to have made &s;o much as one &s;ingle Step. From that Suppo&s;ition it is that I get at the Incre|ment of <HI>x^n,</HI> that I am able to compare it with the Increment of <HI>x,</HI> and that I find the Proportion between the two In|crements.

But then which of the&s;e &s;oever you make it &s;ignify, you mu&s;t argue con|&s;i&s;tently with &s;uch its Signification, and not proceed upon a double Meaning: Which to do were a manife&s;t Sophi&s;m.

Be the Difference ever &s;o &s;mall, yet &s;till there is a Difference.

This is the true State of the Ca&s;e, however it may be di&s;gui&s;ed. And to this in reality it amounts, and is at bottom the &s;ame thing, if we &s;hould pretend to find the Subtangent by hav|ing fir&s;t found, from the Equation of the Curve and &s;imilar Triangles, a ge|neral Expre&s;&s;ion for all Sub&s;ecants, and then reducing the Subtangent under this general Rule, by con&s;idering it as the

And it is all one whatever Magnitude you allow to <HI>BD,</HI> whether that of an infinite&s;imal Difference or a finite Increment ever &s;o great. It is there|fore plain, that the &s;uppo&s;ing the rejectaneous
<PB N="47" REF="54">
algebraical Quantity to be an infinitely &s;mall or evane&s;cent Quantity, and there|fore to be neglected, mu&s;t have produced an Error, had it not been for the curvi|linear Spaces being equal thereto, and at the &s;ame time &s;ubducted from the other Part or Side of the Equation agreeably to the Axiom, <HI>If from Equals you &s;ubduct Equals, the Remainders will be equal.</HI> For tho&s;e Quantities which by the Analy&s;ts are &s;aid to be neglected, or made to vani&s;h, are in reality &s;ubducted.

<P>XXIX. Therefore, be the Power what you plea&s;e, there will ari&s;e on one Side an algebraical Expre&s;&s;ion, on the other a geometrical Quantity, each of which na|turally divides it &s;elf into three Members: The algebraical or fluxionary Expre&s;&s;ion, into one which includes neither the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion

of the Increment of the Ab&s;ci&s;s nor of any Power thereof, another which includes the Expre&s;&s;ion of the Increment it &s;elf, and a third including the Expre&s;|&s;ion of the Powers of the Increment. The geometrical Quantity al&s;o or whole in|crea&s;ed Area con&s;i&s;ts of three Parts or Members, the fir&s;t of which is the given Area, the &s;econd a Rectangle under the Ordinate and the Increment of the Ab|&s;ci&s;s, and the third a curvilinear Space. And, comparing the homologous or cor|re&s;pondent Members on both Sides, we find that as the fir&s;t Member of the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion is the Expre&s;&s;ion of the given Area, &s;o the &s;econd Member of the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion will expre&s;s the Rectangle or &s;e|cond Member of the geometrical Quanti|ty; and the third, containing the Powers of the Increment, will expre&s;s the curvi|linear Space, or third Member of the geo|metrical Quantity. This hint may, per|haps, be further extended and applied to good purpo&s;e, by tho&s;e who have lei&s;ure and curio&s;ity for &s;uch Matters. The u&s;e I make of it is to &s;hew, that the Analy&s;is cannot obtain in Augments or Differences,

<P>XXX. It &s;eems therefore upon the whole that we may &s;afely pronounce, the Conclu&s;ion cannot be right, if in order thereto any Quantity be made to vani&s;h, or be neglected, except that either one Error is redre&s;&s;ed by another; or that &s;e|condly, on the &s;ame Side of an Equa|tion equal Quantities are de&s;troyed by contrary Signs, &s;o that the Quantity we mean to reject is fir&s;t annihilated; or la&s;tly, that from the oppo&s;ite Sides equal Quantities are &s;ubducted.

<P>XLVII. Upon the whole it appears that the Celerities are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and in&s;tead thereof Areas and Ordinates are introduced. But however expedient &s;uch Analogies or &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions may be found for facili|tating the modern Quadratures, yet we &s;hall not find any light given us thereby into the original real nature of Fluxions; or that we are enabled to frame from thence ju&s;t Ideas of Fluxions con&s;idered in them|&s;elves. In all this the general ultimate drift of the Author is very clear, but his Principles are ob&s;cure. But perhaps tho&s;e Theories of the great Author are not mi|nutely con&s;idered or canva&s;&s;ed by his Di&s;|ciples; who &s;eem eager, as was before hinted, rather to operate than to know, rather to apply his Rules and his Forms, than to under&s;tand his Principles and en|ter into his Notions. It is neverthele&s;s cer|tain, that in order to follow him in his Quadratures, they mu&s;t find Fluents from Fluxions; and in order to this, they mu&s;t know to find Fluxions from Fluents; and in order to find Fluxions, they mu&s;t fir&s;t know what Fluxions are. Otherwi&s;e they proceed without Clearne&s;s and without

Science. Thus the direct Method precedes the inver&s;e, and the knowledge of the Principles is &s;uppo&s;ed in both. But as for operating according to Rules, and by the help of general Forms, whereof the ori|ginal Principles and Rea&s;ons are not un|der&s;tood, this is to be e&s;teemed merely technical. Be the Principles therefore ever &s;o ab&s;tru&s;e and metaphy&s;ical, they mu&s;t be &s;tudied by whoever would comprehend the Doctrine of Fluxions. Nor can any Geometrician have a right to apply the Rules of the great Author, without fir&s;t con&s;idering his metaphy&s;ical Notions whence they were derived. The&s;e how nece&s;&s;ary &s;oever in order to Science, which can never be attained without a preci&s;e, clear, and accurate Conception of the Principles, are neverthele&s;s by &s;everal carele&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed over; while the Expre&s;|&s;ions alone are dwelt on and con&s;idered and treated with great Skill and Manage|ment, thence to obtain other Expre&s;&s;ions by Methods, &s;u&s;picious and indirect (to &s;ay the lea&s;t) if con&s;idered in them&s;elves, however recommended by Induction and
