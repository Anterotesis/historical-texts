<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>JOHN DYER,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_I Shall not trouble my kind Reader with a tedious Apology for the Publi&s;hing of this Narrative, but as I hope I have, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, a due &s;en&s;e of my Sins and the folly of my Youth; I think it my Duty to Almighty God and my Country, to Declare openly and truely, &s;uch Things as
<PB N="4" REF="4">
&s;hall be for the Publick Good, and a warning to all Hone&s;t Men, that they may &s;ecure them&s;elves, their Hou&s;es, Goods and Money, from the vile Practices of Highwaymen, Street-Robbers, and Hou&s;e-Breakers, and all &s;orts of Thieves; and I hope my unhappy Fate will be a warning to all Per&s;ons again&s;t the committing &s;uch Crimes, as I &s;adly La|ment, and am to Suffer for, as the ju&s;t Rewards of my Evil Deeds: I beg leave to &s;ay, that I was born of hone&s;t Parents at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who gave me a Sober and &s;olid Education; and when I left my School, they put me to an hone&s;t Trade, a <HI>Cordwainer,</HI> to which I &s;erv'd my Apprentice&s;hip: At my fir&s;t falling into this wicked Cour&s;e of Life; being &s;hort of Money, I made bold to Rob a <HI>Chandlers Shop</HI> of the Money-Box of about 30 s. at <HI>Collingbourn</HI> in the County of <HI>Wilts,</HI> and got clear off without being any ways &s;u&s;|pected: Some time after that, my Ma&s;ter &s;ent me one <HI>Sunday</HI> to another <HI>Chandlers|Shop</HI> to get him a Shilling&s;worth of Half|pence, and there being no Body at Home, I cut the Bar of the Window off, and got in and Rifled all the Shop: I took all the Money I could find, it being about three half Crowns, and out of a merry Frolick I brought away all the Rai&s;ins and Currants that were in the Shop, and they was like to betray me, but I &s;tood it out, with a great A&s;&s;urance, and
<PB N="5" REF="5">
&s;o I got off. I was however, &s;earch'd for the Money, but I had hid it in a parcel of Nettles, but in their &s;earching of me they found &s;ome of the Rai&s;ins in my Coat-Pocket; but as u&s;ual, I in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that I bought them at <HI>Andover</HI> Market the <HI>Saturday</HI> before, and they could not di&s;prove me, &s;o I got clear off. Some &s;hort time after, my Ma&s;ter &s;end|ing me to <HI>Andover</HI> Market with five Pound to buy &s;ome Leather, another Boy and I agreed together to feign a Story as if I had been Robb'd of the Money, &s;o I went home and told my Ma&s;ter that I was Robb'd, and brought the other Boy, who was concern'd with me, who vouch'd it to be True; &s;o the Boy and I &s;hared the five Pound between us: This was done near <HI>Lurger&s;hel</HI> in <HI>Wilt|&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter &s;ometime after that, &s;ent me among&s;t his Cu&s;tomers to get in &s;ome Money which was due to him, upon which I got up about three Pound, and as &s;oon as I receiv'd it I went off with it, and made the be&s;t of my way for <HI>Salisbury</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI>; as &s;oon as I came there, I got acquainted with a young Woman, and with her A&s;&s;i&s;tance and my own, we &s;oon &s;pent the Money; when Madam found the Money gone, &s;he march'd off too, and then I was put to my Shift. Going one Market Day into the Market, I &s;py'd a young Woman, and &s;aw her receive
<PB N="6" REF="6">
&s;ome Money, then I watch'd her till &s;he left the Town, when I follow'd her and overtook her, and knock'd her down, and Robb'd her of what Money &s;he had; afterwards I made her go into the Wood, where I made her comply to my Lu&s;tful de&s;ire; after I had my Will of her, I tied her to a Tree, and there left her; this Robbery was committed about two Miles from <HI>Salisbury.</HI> Afterwards I made my Addre&s;&s;es to a young Woman at a Place call'd <HI>Forthingbridge</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> I went there to Work Journey work, and &s;o became acquainted with her; but after &s;ome &s;mall Acquaintance, I went to Lodge at her Mo|thers, and that was what I wanted, after I had lodg'd &s;ome &s;hort Time there, I made bold to take up my Lodging with the Daugh|ter, which occa&s;ion'd a Swelling in her Belly; finding her&s;elf with Child, &s;he and I con&s;ult|ed to Rob her Mother, which we did of twenty Pounds; after that we made the be&s;t of our way for <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> there we liv'd upon the Rever&s;ion of the Money till it was all gone: Then &s;he return'd once more to pay another vi&s;it to her Mother, where the good old Woman receiv'd her and the Child, with abundance of Joy; I thought it not proper for me to appear, therefore I made the be&s;t of my way, and left the good old Woman to take care of her Dutiful Daughter and Grand|Child.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
After this I made the be&s;t of my way to &s;ee my Mother at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> I had not been long with her, but I took an opportunity to Rob her of fifty Pounds, and went immedi|ately for <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and there Gamed be&s;t part of the Money away: Then I took to Work at my Trade again, and from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> I went to a place call'd <HI>Thornbury</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI>; and there I came acquainted with one Mrs. <HI>Low</HI> a Widow Woman, where we liv'd toge|ther about &s;ix Months, and we took the Town in for about 30 <HI>l.</HI> then we Sold all off, and went to a Place call'd <HI>Weekware,</HI> and there the Biter was Bit; for I agreed with a <HI>Collier</HI> to go Partners with him, and was to give him 50 <HI>l.</HI> whereof I gave him 30 <HI>l.</HI> down, and was to pay him the other Monthly, but before I came to pay the fir&s;t Payment, my very good Friend the <HI>Collier</HI> went off of the Ground, <HI>and &s;o the Biter was Bit indeed,</HI> &s;o I pack'd up my Awls and came packing away from thence.</P>
<P>From thence I went to a Place call'd <HI>Bart|ley</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and there I work'd very hone&s;tly for &s;ometime, till I was known by a Man that came from <HI>Thornbury,</HI> and was oblig'd to move farther, for fear of being be|tray'd, &s;o I pack'd up my Awls there likewi&s;e, and went to <HI>Hereford</HI> City, and Work'd there very Hone&s;tly; till one Night I was in Com|pany with a <HI>Higler,</HI> and he &s;aid he was a go|ing
<PB N="8" REF="8">
to a Place call'd <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> to buy &s;ome Fowls; I readily reply'd, I don't care if I go along with you, he &s;aid he &s;hould be very glad of my Company, but poor Man, he little thought I &s;hould deprive him of his Journey; the next Day accordingly we &s;et out, and had not gone above four Miles but I attack'd my Fellow|Traveller, and robb'd him of two Shillings; I thought that but a very &s;mall matter of Money for him to buy Poultry with, there|fore I had a thought came into my Head to &s;earch the Hampers, and accordingly I did, where I found twelve Pounds; &s;o I left him his Hampers to look on, but his Hor&s;e I took, and rid him about 40 Miles, and then turn'd him loo&s;e: After that I went to <HI>Marlborough</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and &s;tay'd there about a Fort|night, there I was taken and put into <HI>Marl|borough</HI> Goal for a Silver pint Mug where I remain'd about a Fortnight, but one Night I took an Opportunity and made my E&s;cape, and never had the Manners to take my leave of my new Landlord, which gave me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, but that &s;oon went off.</P>
<P>From thence I went to &s;ee an <HI>Aunt</HI> of mine, at a Place call'd <HI>Douton,</HI> within &s;even or eight Miles of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and there I re|main'd till my <HI>Uncle</HI> and <HI>Aunt</HI> began to have Words about me; but the fir&s;t Oppor|tunity I had, I took my Leave of my <HI>Uncle</HI> and Aunt, and went afterwards to my own
<PB N="9" REF="9">
Si&s;ter, and there liv'd with her about &s;ix Months, and I met with an old Play|mate, where we renew'd our former Ac|quaintance, and began to play &s;ome of our old former Pranks; for we thought, what we took from our own Friends, was our own, and no Robbery, we having in our Opinion, as much right to it as them; &s;o we very di&s;hone&s;tly, and he like an unduti|ful Son, began with his own Mother, and robb'd her to the Value of about fifty Shil|lings, or three Pounds; and then we re|turn'd to our old Cour&s;e of Life, Gaming, as we had done before; but we was di&s;ap|pointed of our Aim, for we was &s;oon ap|prehended and taken, and brought Home to his Mother's, where we were mightily per|&s;uaded to own the Robbery, but we as u&s;u|al brazen'd it out; but after all, they carri|ed us before a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and he very hone&s;tly committed us to <HI>Bridewell</HI>; where not approving of our new Lodging, we thought it not convenient for us to &s;tay, therefore we made our Way thro' the Nece&s;|&s;ary-Hou&s;e, without &s;o much as taking Leave of our Landlord.</P>
<P>Afterwards I turn'd Jockey, and went to Hor&s;e-Cour&s;ing, and took as many Hor&s;es one Spring, out of the King's New-Fore&s;t, near <HI>Rum&s;ay,</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> as I &s;old for a|bove three&s;core Pounds, at thirty and forty
<PB N="10" REF="10">
Shillings a-piece; they were none of your large Hor&s;es, but only little Fore&s;ters; and indeed, I went &s;o often, that I was a&s;ham'd to go any more, for fear that the People &s;hould think much of my Coming, &s;o I thought it be&s;t to leave off in Time; but &s;oon after I &s;tole a Hor&s;e, and &s;et up a new Trade, but do not think it proper to name the Man, that I &s;tole the Hor&s;e from, becau&s;e the Owner of it is a-live, and he knows me. I went to work, and the fir&s;t Man I met with in that Way, was one Mr. <HI>Whitehead,</HI> a Painter, and I robb'd him of eighteen Shillings and a Plate-button-Coat, and coming bravely off of that, put more Courage into me; and I bought me a Pair of Pi&s;tols with &s;ome of the Money, for I had but one before, and then I was &s;tock'd very well. And &s;o I proceeded on too,</P>
<P>The next Adventure, which was with an old Man, that was going to Market, to buy a Pig, but I &s;oon &s;topp'd his Journey, and robb'd him, and took what Money he had away from him, and &s;ent him Home about his Bu&s;ine&s;s; the Man is &s;ince dead, he lived at a Place called <HI>White-Pari&s;h,</HI> near <HI>Salisbury,</HI> his Name was <HI>John Price,</HI> a Taylor. After|wards I went on with my old, or rather new Game, and with Abundance of Cou|rage, having pretty good Succe&s;s, the next that I met with was a Butter-Woman, com|ing
<PB N="11" REF="11">
from <HI>Rum&s;ay-Market,</HI> and I robb'd her of twelve Shillings, and made her go about her Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;he had not been gone long, but came by a Servant-Maid, ju&s;t out of Place, &s;o I made bold to rifle her of all the Money &s;he had. The Sum mounted to three and fifty Shillings, and a Ring from her, and after having &s;erved her &s;o, I thought it Pity to let her carry a Box of Luggage, and ea&s;ed her of that al&s;o; in the Box I found two Suits of Cloaths, and Linnen, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, which &s;erved for tra|velling Charges, &s;o I came away about my Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>From thence I went to <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and there I di&s;pos'd of the Box of Cloaths, and afterwards I went to the <HI>Cock Alehou&s;e,</HI> in <HI>High-Street,</HI> and after &s;ometime Drinking, I fell into Di&s;cour&s;e with a <HI>Laceman</HI> about Travelling, till the <HI>Laceman</HI> told me he was going to <HI>Amsbury</HI> Fair, in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> I told him I was going that Way too, &s;o at Night, when we got to <HI>Amsbury,</HI> and put up our Hor&s;es, at the Sign of the <HI>Chopping-Knife,</HI> at one Mr. <HI>Hedges</HI>'s, from whence the <HI>Lace|man</HI> went out to take a Standing for to &s;ell his Goods in; and the while he was gone, I went to the <HI>Landlord,</HI> and asked him for my Partner's Box of Lace, and he gave it to me, and I went to the <HI>Ho&s;tler,</HI> and got my
<PB N="12" REF="12">
Hor&s;e, and away I went, and left the <HI>Land|lord</HI> and the <HI>Laceman</HI> to agree.</P>
<P>The next I met with, a bonny <HI>Scot,</HI> tra|velling over the Plain, going towards the <HI>De|vizes,</HI> and I &s;aid, well over-taken Mr. <HI>John|&s;on,</HI> and he &s;aid, <HI>How Mon, how done you,</HI> but he did not know me, but I knew him, &s;o a&s;ked him if he had any good Handker|chiefs, and &s;aid Yea, he put down his Pack, and opened it, and &s;howed me &s;everal Sorts of Goods, among which I &s;aw a large Quan|tity of Hair, which is a good Commodity; &s;o I &s;aid to my Friend <HI>John&s;on, that I did not want to buy any Thing of him, for I mu&s;t have them for nothing</HI>; but he began to make Words about that, and was going to be <HI>ob&s;tropolous,</HI> till I &s;hew'd him the Pi&s;tols; and then he begged very heartily not for to u&s;e him ill, and take all that he had, upon which I took him about forty Yards from his Pack, and there tied him to the Po&s;t of a Well, and then went and &s;earched the Pack all over, and found therein nine Pounds odd Money, and a great Parcel of Hair, as much as I &s;old at <HI>Marlborough</HI> for eight Pounds. I al&s;o took &s;ix Dozen of Handkerchiefs, and a Quantity of Mu&s;lin, all that was light Carriage; and when I had took as much as I thought proper, I went and relea&s;ed the <HI>Scotchman</HI> from the Well, that he might take Care of his Pack again, and then I took my
<PB N="13" REF="13">
Leave of Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> and he paid his Re|&s;pects in a very hand&s;ome Manner, but it was more out of <HI>Fear,</HI> than <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>After I had parted from the <HI>Scotchman,</HI> I met with a jolly Shepherd, that had been at a Place call'd <HI>Burfet-Fair</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and had &s;old a Quantity of Sheep for his Ma&s;ter, but that was a Mi&s;take of mine, to &s;ay, that he &s;old them for his Ma&s;ter, <HI>I &s;hould rather have &s;aid, he had &s;old them for me</HI>; for I met him at a Place call'd <HI>Humington,</HI> about two Miles from the <HI>Fair,</HI> where he &s;old the Sheep, and there I attack'd him, but he was a good old Fellow, for before he would part with his Money, he would have a Duel; I was loth to kill him, becau&s;e he was a brave Fellow, &s;o I fought him with my Hanger, till the old Fellow yielded, and then I rifled him all over, and took from him &s;eventy odd Pounds, which he had receiv'd for the Sheep, upon which he &s;aid, that if he had had his <HI>Crook,</HI> he would not a Lo&s;t his Money without he had been kill'd; but as I have not my Weapon, &s;ays he, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and &s;o he went homewards about his Bu&s;ine&s;s. After which I went away about mine al&s;o, to a Place call'd <HI>Dortche&s;ter,</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and there I &s;tay'd till be&s;t Part of my Money was wa&s;ted, where I took up with a broken <HI>But|cher</HI> to be my Companion, but I was dubi|ous of him, for fear that his Heart &s;hould
<PB N="14" REF="14">
fail him, but it did not, for he proved to be a good Fellow, and &s;o we agreed very well together, for &s;ome Time, till he began to &s;ink &s;ome of the Monies out of our Stock; but I found him out, and told him of it, and he owned it, but &s;aid he never would do &s;o no more, and &s;o we agreed and went on together.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Butcher</HI> and I went to a Place call'd <HI>Woodbury-Hill-Fair,</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and there we tarry'd till the Fair was over, and then our Fair began. We attack'd a Man that had been &s;elling of Chee&s;es, but he had but a &s;mall Matter of Money about him, for he had paid it away, for we &s;ee him receive above four&s;core Pounds; but when we came to &s;earch him, he had not above twelve Pounds about him; on which we fell a <HI>Cur|&s;ing</HI> our hard Fortune, and we gave him four or five good Licks with our Whips, <HI>and bid him never pay Money away when Gen|tlemen waited to receive it</HI>; but the old Man went homewards very heavy Hearted as it was, we did not take above twelve Pound from him, which was but a &s;mall Trifle to what we expected; and &s;o we left the hone&s;t <HI>Chee&s;|man.</HI></P>
<P>The next was an hone&s;t <HI>Hop-Merchant,</HI> who an&s;wer'd our Expectation very well, but we may thank his Wife for our Booty, for when we begun to &s;earch him, we did not find any
<PB N="15" REF="15">
Money about him, till we began to Cur&s;e and Swear, and &s;aid we would kill him, and then the good Wife cry'd out, do not kill him, and I will tell you where the Money is; &s;o I ask'd her, and &s;he &s;aid, it was in his Boots, upon which I took my Knife out of my Pocket and cut his Boots off of his Legs, and there found in his Boots fifty Guineas, which I liked the Looks of very well; &s;o I took and put them in my Pocket, and we went &s;miling away about our Bu&s;ine&s;s; returning Thanks to the good Woman for our Booty.</P>
<P>From thence I and my Friend went away together from <HI>Woodbury-Hill,</HI> to a Place call'd <HI>Sherbourn,</HI> and there we &s;taid and took our Plea&s;ure for &s;ome Time, and we got each of us a fine La&s;s to divert us by the way, &s;o we &s;taid and enjoy'd our &s;elves as well as we could for &s;ome Time, when we had Informa|tion of a <HI>Gra&s;ier</HI> going further down into the Country to buy &s;ome lean Bea&s;t to fatten; upon which we went after him and robb'd him of all the Money he had, which was four&s;core and ten Pounds; with which we diverted our &s;elves, and came back again in hopes of more Bu&s;ine&s;s, and went to a place call'd <HI>Ringwood</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and there my Friend happened to fall &s;ick, and lay for &s;ome Time, till that Money was almo&s;t con&s;umed; and then grow|ing pretty well again, I took him down to the <HI>Bath</HI> with me, where we &s;taid about &s;ix Weeks,
<PB N="16" REF="16">
and then we fell to work again, and robb'd the Stage Coaches going from <HI>Bath</HI> to <HI>London</HI>; and took them as they came back again from <HI>London</HI> to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and continued that Practice till they were oblig'd to hire People to guard the Coach to and fro, as it pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Bath</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> and from <HI>London</HI> to the <HI>Bath</HI>: We robb'd the Stage for &s;ix Weeks together, as it pa&s;&s;ed to and fro every Time; but once we were like to receive Damage by a Gentle|man in the Coach, for as we went up to de|mand the Money, the Gentleman fired a Blun|derbu&s;s at us, but mi&s;s'd us both; however, we robb'd them afterwards, and well Hor&s;e|whipp'd the Gentleman for his Reward, and then we came away about other Bu&s;ine&s;s of the like Nature.</P>
<P>The next Adventure was at a Place call'd <HI>Hungerford,</HI> and there we &s;taid for two Months, where I made up a Match for my Friend to be marry'd to a Widow Woman, one of his own Trade; &s;o we liv'd very well there, till &s;uch time we were blow'd by &s;omebody that knew us, and was very near being taken, but by good Conduct we got away &s;afe, and came to <HI>Newberry,</HI> which was not a great ways from the Place where we was put to the Rout; that did not put any &s;top to our Proceedings, we met with a <HI>Tallow-Chandler,</HI> not far from <HI>New|berry,</HI> and we robbed him of what he had; then we concluded to go and &s;ee one of the Wonders of
<PB N="17" REF="17">
the Country, a Place called <HI>Stoneage,</HI> where we &s;taid about three or four Days, and then we concluded to make our way further from our Enemies, and agreed to come to <HI>London,</HI> which accordingly we did, and proceeded on our Journey till we came to <HI>Reading,</HI> and there we was like to be taken again by the <HI>Bath</HI> Stage Coachman; but I and my Friend were pretty well mounted, and by good Luck got away, and rode that Night, and the next Day, from <HI>Reading</HI> to <HI>Exeter</HI> in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and there we were &s;afe; &s;o we remained there a|bout three Weeks; but being very unea&s;y in our Minds, for fear we &s;hould be taken, we agreed to part by Con&s;ent, and accordingly we did; and he went back to <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> again, and I &s;et out for <HI>Salisbury</HI> to &s;ee my Friends, and &s;taid there about a Week: After which I &s;et out again for <HI>London</HI> once more, by a round about way, and in coming to <HI>London,</HI> I met with four young Sparks who were going for <HI>Oxford,</HI> but the merry Joke was, that after I had attack'd and had &s;earch'd them, I could not find any Money about two of them, but the other two I had rifled, and took from them their Money and Watches, and was riding away therewith; they called to me, and told me that their Companions had Money about them, &s;o I went to Work again, and at la&s;t I found Money upon one of them, planted under the Buttons of his Coat, and eas'd him

<P>When I came to <HI>London,</HI> I liv'd very ho|ne&s;t, and went to Work Journey-work at my Trade, and Lodg'd at one Mr. <HI>Rickets</HI> a Shoe-maker in <HI>Harp-Alley, Shoe-Lane,</HI> and there Work'd for about Six Months, for Mr. <HI>Holliday,</HI> Shoe-maker upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill</HI>; and from thence I moved into <HI>Leather-Lane</HI> in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> and there I Work'd almo&s;t Twelve|months; till at la&s;t I took up with a Harlot of the Town; I had not kept her Company

wanted Money, but did not know how to get any, open'd his mind to me one Night as we was a walking in the Fields; and &s;aid he mu&s;t go upon the Highway, or el&s;e he mu&s;t go to Pri&s;on; &s;o I asked him if ever he did any &s;uch thing? he &s;aid no; and I asked him if he had any Pi&s;tols, he &s;aid no, but he would Pledge his Watch and buy a Pair, and accordingly he did; and he and I went out one Night together, and at the old <HI>Spaw</HI> we &s;top'd a Man and Rob'd him of his Watch and two Rings and what Money he had, which was not much, it was about 7 or 8 <HI>s.</HI> in Silver; and from thence we went farther into the Fields, and by <HI>Sadlers-Wells</HI> we rob'd another Gentleman of his Watch and one Cypher Ring with a Heart in it, and a pair of Silver Buckles, his Hat and Wig, and then we ty'd his Hands and Legs and came away and left him. My Companion thought that was a good and quick way to get Money, therefore he liked it &s;o well, that he kept to it; &s;o the next time that we went out, we had better Succe&s;s than we had before, for we &s;top'd a Gentleman's Chariot up by <HI>Pancras-wa&s;h,</HI> and robb'd the Gentle|man and his Lady, to the Value of 30 <HI>l.</HI> in Goods and Money, and &s;o we came home.</P>
<P>Soon after which my Friend and I met one Mr. <HI>Lewen,</HI> the late City <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> and robb'd him to the Sum of near eight Pounds, in <HI>Horn|&s;ey-Lane,</HI>

The next Engagement was in the <HI>Strand,</HI> where we &s;topp'd a Hackney Coach, and rifled the Men all over, but to a very little Purpo&s;e.

<P>I hope I &s;hall not be thought tedious in gi|ving this true and plain Account how I fell from the Paths of Virtue, and a &s;ober Religious Life in which my Dear Parents took great care to have render'd me an hone&s;t Man; I do not boa&s;t of my Sins, nor believe there is any real &s;atisfaction in the doing what is ill, con|trary to the Laws of God and Man: I hum|bly take &s;hame to my &s;elf, and do affirm that the foregoing <HI>Narrative</HI> is in every part true; I only rehear&s;e it to warn young Men e&s;peci|ally to take notice by what degrees I fell into the&s;e Crimes, &s;o that they may by the Pru|dent u&s;e of God's Grace, be pre&s;erved from Iniquities: I have &s;hewn how Ma&s;ters may be wronged by their Servants, who follow &s;uch Vices as I own I have done, as well as to caution again&s;t the &s;ad con&s;equences of conver&s;ing with lewd Women, and as what I have already &s;aid was Principally done in the Country. I &s;hall now proceed plainly and briefly as I can, to &s;hew what Company and more pernicious Adventures I have more late|ly been engag'd in, which has brought me to many dangerous Misfortunes, and render'd me liable to be Pro&s;ecuted, even by my vile

<P>Some little Time after our E&s;cape in <HI>Lin|coln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Fields</HI> before mention'd; I and my Fellowmen robb'd a Gentleman and a Woman at <HI>Hyde-Park</HI> corner in a Hackney Coach, of a &s;ilver Watch, Snuff Box, and about four or five Pounds in Money, and a &s;mall Cypher Ring, the Value of it was not very much, but they was very de&s;iring not to part with it, which made us the more eager to keep it; but we told the People <HI>that if it was not a Diamond one, they &s;hould have it again, if they would let us know their Names, and where to direct for them, they &s;hould have it again</HI>; (upon Honour) and accordingly we &s;ent it to them to the <HI>Devil-Tavern</HI> at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI> in a Penny-Po&s;t Letter, for it was no Service to us.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="27">
Some &s;mall time after, we met a <HI>Clergyman</HI> near the &s;ame Place, where we Robbed him of all his Money, Watch, Hat and Wig, and &s;o came Home for that Night.</P>
<P>The next Prank we play'd was at <HI>Hollow|way,</HI> going to <HI>Highgate,</HI> and there we Robbed the <HI>Barnet</HI> Stage Coach; there was but two Pa&s;&s;engers in the Coach, and we Rifled them both, but they had but a &s;mall quantity of Money about them, not above thirty Shillings between them; we &s;tay'd there about all Night till Morning, and met with the <HI>Hog|Butchers</HI> going to <HI>Finchley</HI> to buy <HI>Hogs,</HI> but I believe it prevented their Journey, for they were oblig'd to go back again to fetch more Money before they could proceed on their Journey; for we took from them between forty and fifty Pounds, and came away about our Bu&s;ine&s;s; <HI>but I fear they were oblig'd to &s;ell Bacon very dear to fetch up their Money we took from them.</HI></P>
<P>The next was an hone&s;t <HI>Baker</HI> (if a <HI>Baker</HI> can be &s;o) that we met coming from <HI>Hamp|&s;tead,</HI> but he was very much in Liquor, and which oblig'd us to tye his Hands and Feet before we could do any thing with him, and then we rifled him of twenty-five Pounds, a Silver Watch and two plain Rings, and left him in the Fields.</P>
<P>We next met with a <HI>Hackney-Coach</HI> coming from <HI>Hamp&s;tead,</HI> with two <HI>Taylors</HI> and a Wo|man
<PB N="28" REF="28">
in it, we pull'd the <HI>Taylors</HI> out of the Coach to Search them, and then we handed their Lady out and rifled her al&s;o, but &s;he was worth both the <HI>Taylors,</HI> for &s;he had a very hand&s;ome Gold Chain about her Neck, and two good Rings on her Fingers, and a <HI>Spanker</HI> in her Pocket, and Seven or Eight Shillings in Silver, but the two poor <HI>Taylors</HI> not above four Shillings between them; &s;o we bid the Coachman drive on, and I gave him half a Crown <HI>and bid him &s;ay nothing</HI>; but when they came to <HI>Tottenham-Court</HI> Turn-Pyke, the Coachman begun to cry out, <HI>Thieves and Rogues on the Road</HI>; but he little thought that we was &s;o nigh them, for we heard every Word they &s;aid, and &s;o they went on about their Bu&s;ine&s;s, but the Coachman had better to have held his Tongue, and then he might have got home Safe, <HI>but he fared well, and cry'd Roa&s;t-meat</HI>; upon which as &s;oon as he had pa&s;s'd the Turn-Pyke we &s;top'd him and took the half Crown from him, that we had before given him, and twelve Shillings to boot, and made him go about his Bu&s;ine&s;s, which we &s;aid would <HI>teach the Fool more Wit another Time.</HI></P>
<P>In an other Adventure, I and my Compa|nion undertook to rob the <HI>Salisbury</HI> Waggon, at <HI>Knightsbridge</HI>; there prov'd to be but one Pa&s;&s;enger in it, who was a Country Fellow, and going into the Country; he had but a
<PB N="29" REF="29">
&s;mall Store of Money about him, and was very loth to part with it, but we frighted him into a Compliance, and left him Penny|le&s;s, all he had was twelve Shillings and Six-pence. We had not Time, nor proper Opportunity, to take out any Boxes, it be|ing &s;o near the Town, and People pa&s;&s;ing hard-by, who probably &s;aw what we were Doing; but they, and the Waggoners, find|ing our being armed with &s;everal Pi&s;tols, made free Way for our E&s;capes.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day we took a Tour to <HI>Black|heath,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> where we met with a Gen|tleman on Hor&s;eback, well mounted; my Partner &s;uddenly took hold of his Hor&s;e, whil&s;t I &s;urprized the Gentleman, laying hold of him, pre&s;ented my Pi&s;tol to his Brea&s;t, cock'd and prim'd, &s;wearing, [<HI>The Lord in Mercy pardon me,</HI>] <HI>that I would &s;hoot him im|mediately, if he did not in&s;tantly, without any Delay, or making any Noi&s;e, deliver what he had</HI>; and we took from him fourteen Shil|lings in Money, and a hand&s;ome &s;ilver Watch, cutting his Stirrups, and Hor&s;e's Bridle, we left him unmounted, not imagi|ning he could, or would attempt to follow after us; but unexpectedly, the enraged Gen|tleman mended the broken Bridle, that he mounted again, and pur&s;u'd us with more <HI>Ra&s;hne&s;s</HI> than with <HI>Prudence,</HI> for his own <HI>Safety</HI>; for he pur&s;u'd us with &s;o great Ha&s;t,
<PB N="30" REF="30">
that he forced us to attack him, in our own Defence, whil&s;t we ran over the Common; whereas, had he &s;liely followed us, as he might have done, we having not the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of his being mounted, he might have ea&s;ily apprehended us, when he had found us in a conveniently Place, where he might have had A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but he, as I &s;aid before, attack'd us by him&s;elf, that we were forced to unhor&s;e him again, to give him <HI>Blows</HI> for his <HI>Blows,</HI> and then, to bind him to &s;trick Obedience of our Plea&s;ure. <HI>viz. To lie quiet until we were out of Sight</HI>; and to &s;peak the Truth, we left him &s;ecure, until &s;ome might come to relieve him; and for his Hor&s;e, we quite demoli&s;hed his Furniture, and turned him loo&s;e, and by this Means got free from one of the mo&s;t refractory Chaps I ever met with; in a Word, he acted as a Per&s;on <HI>drunk</HI> or <HI>mad.</HI></P>
<P>We took our Way by <HI>Peckham</HI> to <HI>Lam|beth,</HI> and &s;o over the Ferry, and &s;o Home, to &s;pend the &s;ad Fruits of our abominable Labour; and &s;hortly after, as our Wants required, we took a Journey to <HI>Epping-Fo|re&s;t,</HI> where looking for our Prey, we met with a Gentleman and his Lady in a Chai&s;e; we civilly acco&s;t them, in our Way, de&s;iring them, <HI>To &s;upply our Want of Money,</HI> which we hoped they could conveniently &s;pare; which they being unwilling to do, we took
<PB N="31" REF="31">
the Boldne&s;s to oblige them to alight, and &s;hewing our Pi&s;tols, the Fear of Death com|pelled them to &s;ubmit to be &s;earch'd, and we found five Guineas and &s;ome Silver, and a &s;ilver Watch from the Gentleman, and a Ring and &s;ilver Snuff-Box from the Lady, who we u&s;ed with great Tenderne&s;s, ob&s;er|ving that &s;he was in a great Fright, in&s;o|much, that they freely forgave us, and would never pro&s;ecute us, if it &s;hould be in their Power, and &s;o we parted with great Curte&s;y. This Booty &s;erved us a little while, but we quickly <HI>turned out</HI> again, chu|&s;ing to change our Hor&s;es, Apparel, Wigs, and every Thing that was remarkable about us.</P>
<P>The next Attempt we made, was on <HI>Hat|field</HI> Common, were we met a <HI>Tallow-Chand|ler</HI> coming from <HI>Ware,</HI> who was well moun|ted, and &s;omewhat ob&s;tinate; however, we took from him eleven Guineas, and about &s;even or eight Shillings in Silver; we left him unhors'd, and made the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Way we could back to Town. Immediately after we met a Gentleman very drunk, on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> of whom we took five Pounds in Silver, his Hat and Wig, after he had been very ru&s;tical and fought with us. We were forced to prevent his Clamour and Noi&s;e, for he began to cry out aloud for Help; but we left him on the Ground, and took pru|dently
<PB N="32" REF="32">
to our Heels. The &s;ame Morning we made our Way Home by <HI>Doctors-Commons, where we de&s;ir'd a Gentleman to &s;peak with us,</HI> and telling him our Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>was wanting Money,</HI> we begged that he would &s;pare what he had about him; the Gentleman was great|ly &s;urpriz'd &s;eeing our Commi&s;&s;ion, a Pi&s;tol, begged of us <HI>not to kill him,</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>no Sir, We will not hurt your Body, it's your Money we want, and that we mu&s;t, and will have</HI>; we were forced to rifle him, and took about thirty five Shillings; he did (<HI>&s;tage much</HI>) that is our <HI>Cant</HI> Word for <HI>crying out</HI>; &s;o we left him, and found no Manner of Annoy|ance from the Watchmen, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Coming to <HI>Fleet-Ditch,</HI> in <HI>Harp Alley,</HI> we met with a Per&s;on, who for &s;ome Rea&s;ons I believe was a <HI>Grocer,</HI> he was &s;urprized and &s;topt by us, we took from him fourteen Shil|lings, a Watch, and a Cane, which he was pretty ea&s;y to part withal, after we had put him into a trembling Fit. A few Days after we and our <HI>Doxies</HI> having con&s;umed the Pro|duct of our ill-gotten Pelf, we turned into <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Lane,</HI> in our common Road, like Birds of Prey, and there we met with one of the Di&s;turbers of <HI>Human Society,</HI> I mean a <HI>Petty Fogging Lawyer</HI> (as he call'd him&s;elf) who upon our attacking him, told us his Em|ploy, and would argue with us, with the Con|&s;ideration of the great Danger we &s;hould bring
<PB N="33" REF="33">
upon our&s;elves, by provoking a Per&s;on of his Knowledge; how to find us out he knew ma|ny <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Highwaymen</HI>; &s;ome had been his <HI>Clients,</HI> and as for the <HI>Thief-Takers</HI> he knew all, in or about <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> We had dragg'd him, partly by Force, and gentle Per&s;ua&s;ions, to a convenient dark &s;ilent Place under the Walls, and found him &s;o Di|verting, that I de&s;ired my Partners to let him go; but one of them had felt his Pocket, and &s;aid there was <HI>Swag</HI> in it, and obliged me to con&s;ent that he might rifle his Pocket, where they found Thirty odd Shillings, and one of them took his Sword, gilt Handle, of little Value; the poor Gentleman was obliged to &s;ubmit, and has &s;ince made a mo&s;t &s;ad Com|plaint, to &s;ome of my Acquaintance, who a&s;&s;ures me, that he pretended in <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn,</HI> to have lo&s;t a great Sum of his Clients Money. We left him in a quiet Temper, and much I fear &s;ome Thieves as well as hone&s;t Men, have dearly paid for this Robbery, which was done very lately in the la&s;t long Vacation.</P>
<P>Another very late Crime I committed with my Companion, was on a <HI>Victualler,</HI> who ha|ving been Merry with his Friends abroad, was reeling over <HI>Bloomsbury-Market,</HI> betwixt One and Two in the Morning; we attack'd him, and he plea&s;antly asked, <HI>What we meant, what we wanted</HI>; our Reply was &s;till the Same&punc; <HI>We were Men of Fortune, and Money</HI>

<HI>was our Game.</HI> We had no Time, the Place would not admit of a long Di&s;pute, we flung him down, &s;topp'd his Mouth, (not to hurt him) then took from a &s;ilver Watch, Seventeen Shillings in Money, two plain Rings, and his Buckles out of his Shoes, and &s;o <HI>wi&s;h'd him better For|tune for the Future.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards in <HI>Tottenham Court Road,</HI> we met with a Man coming to Town, we &s;eized him by Surprize and took from him Forty|four Shillings, and the Man was as Joyful to be rid of our Company, as we were to be free from him: I prevented his being &s;tripp'd of his Cloaths, for I ever abhorr'd to leave any Per&s;on naked, or to offer any Violence to mode&s;t Women, but have often re&s;trained the rude and cruel Behaviour of my unhap|py Acquaintance, when &s;uch Attempts have been de&s;igned.</P>
<P>Another late Exploit was returning to <HI>Chel|&s;ea</HI> Road, where we met with two <HI>Gardiners,</HI> coming Drunk from Market, they prov'd very Trouble&s;ome a-while, but we were too Strong for them, and our u&s;ual Arms a|frighted them to a Compliance, &s;o we took 12 <HI>s.</HI> from them, and they having warm great Coats, and my Companions wanting them, took the Freedom to take them, and tied them Back to Back, di&s;abling them from pur&s;uing us. In the long Field we robb'd Mr. <HI>Homes,</HI> commonly call'd Lord <HI>Homes,</HI> a Clerk at <HI>Chel|&s;ea,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="35">
he had a Guinea and a Steel Seal, which was all he had about him, but the Patrole coming that way, which we were aware off, we made our E&s;cape with great Precipitation. Other Crimes we committed, and laid wait to do, to the Prejudice of great Men, and par|ticular private Families, which may not in the Reading be unacceptable to the Reader.</P>
<P>I not long ago meet with a Per&s;on of &s;ome di&s;tinction well known in this Town of the &s;ordid vile Company of <HI>Sodamites</HI> [I was clean dre&s;t and look'd fre&s;h] in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn Fields,</HI> he pretended after &s;everal times turn|ing and looking hard at me to know me, and de&s;ired me as I went along to go and drink a Gla&s;s of Wine with him at a Tavern, which I con&s;ented to do, and he going to the Draw|er de&s;ired a good Room up Stairs, who car|ried us into a Room next the Street, which happen'd luckily to my purpo&s;e; for this Gentleman (who is in Years) was very amo|rous upon me, and would by all means treat me with a Fowl or any thing I could Eat, which was order'd accordingly, and whil&s;t it was getting ready, he took a Diamond Ring from his Finger, &s;aying it was a rich Stone; I begg'd the Favour to &s;ee if my Finger was not bigger then his, which he granted, and pre&s;ently after I had it on, I being near the Window and &s;eeing a Coach going by, I call'd out &s;top Coach, pretending I had a Friend in

the Coach that I wanted to Speak with; I ran down Stairs, and &s;o went off with the Ring. I &s;hortly after met the &s;ame Gentleman under the great Arch in <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Fields,</HI> who in a Surpize told me he wondered that I carried away his Ring, I gave him a &s;urley An&s;wer, and &s;o he went quietly away.</P>
<P>A <HI>Whipmaker's</HI> Hou&s;e in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> we broke open, and took a quantity of Whips from him one <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, and we came away &s;afe.</P>
<P>The next was a <HI>Shoemaker's</HI> Shop in <HI>Wild|Court</HI> near <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> and there I and my Companions, took away all the Shoes the Man had in his Shop, and likewi&s;e came off &s;afe that Night.</P>
<P>I am my Companion had a mind for a hol|low Bit, &s;o we open'd a <HI>Poulterer's</HI> Shop in <HI>Clare-Market,</HI> (with a fal&s;e Key) and took a dozen of Chickens, and two Turkeys for our Selves and Doxies, ju&s;t for our own Spend|ing; for &s;oon after one of our Doxies lay-in, and with the help of tho&s;e Chickens and two Turkeys, we made a grand Chri&s;tening, were we had &s;ome of our own Fraternity and Dox|ies; but my Companion and I never had the good Manners to Invite the <HI>Poulterer</HI> and his Wife.</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince we met a Man in <HI>Kirby|&s;treet</HI> near <HI>Hatton-Garden,</HI> and we knock'd him down, and Robb'd him of his Hat and
<PB N="37" REF="37">
Whig, and that was all, for we were di&s;turb|ed from doing any more, for the Watch came and Surrounded us, that we was oblig'd to Fire before we could get away, but by good Luck we got off Safe.</P>
<P>Then we broke open a <HI>Linnen Draper's</HI> Shop at the Sign of the <HI>Maiden-Head</HI> in <HI>Piccadilly,</HI> there we took a great Quantity of Linnen, as much as two of us could well bring away, and came off with it, without being Di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The two la&s;t Robberies I was Capi|tally Convicted for at the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, at the <HI>Old-Bailey,</HI> and am to Suffer To-morrow, at <HI>Tyburn</HI> for them.</P>
