<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Take the Liberty of addre&s;|&s;ing the following Sheets to you, without the Formality of asking your Leave: I have for a long Time thought that &s;uch a Formality propo&s;es an implicite Bar|gain, which is very liable to be turn'd into Ridicule. This was the Opinion
<PB REF="4">
of the late Earl of <HI>Hallifax,</HI> who had receiv'd more Addre&s;&s;es of this Nature, than any Man of his Time. The End of this Epi&s;tle, is, to return you my humble Thanks for Obligations pa&s;t; for Obligations laid not only upon me, but upon my Country, when you en|deavour'd to &s;erve it &s;o warmly, by oppo&s;ing that de&s;perate Scheme which had like to have proved &s;o fatal to it, and by advi&s;ing, after the Mi&s;chief was done, the U&s;e of Lenitives, rather than of Corro&s;ives, which might have thrown all Things into Confu&s;ion. Another Intention of this Addre&s;s, is, to implore your Protection for the ex|piring Arts; for tho&s;e noble Arts in which you have been educated, and which have rais'd you to this envied Heighth, as it were, on purpo&s;e that you may prove their Protector and Pre|&s;erver. You are not to be told, Sir, and it would be ea&s;y to prove it to the re&s;t of the World, that the Studies of Humanity in <HI>Great Britain</HI> have flouri&s;h'd with the Stage; and that with
<PB REF="5">
the Stage they mu&s;t in time decline. I &s;peak not only of every other Branch of Poetry, but even of that manly Eloquence which appears &s;o con&s;picu|ous in you, whenever you are pleas'd to di&s;play its Charms to an Augu&s;t A&s;|&s;embly. But the Stage is ju&s;t upon the Point of &s;inking, unle&s;s an Arm &s;o powerful as yours &s;hall vouch&s;afe to &s;upport it. A <HI>Wat Tyler,</HI> a <HI>Jack Straw,</HI> and a <HI>Jack Cade</HI> of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> have by Encroachments got the entire Direction of it from its ea&s;y Patentee, and &s;eem re&s;olv'd, like their Name-&s;akes of old, to advance the Rabble and Scum of <HI>Par|na&s;&s;us,</HI> and to oppre&s;s or demoli&s;h all whom God and Nature have plac'd above them. The Dramatick Piece on which I have writ the following Re|marks, has, with a thou&s;and Faults, and a thou&s;and Weakne&s;&s;es, been palm'd upon the World by &s;hameful Artifices for a Wonder of Art and Na|ture: And that no one may pre&s;ume to detect the Fraud, the Author has in&s;olently dar'd to fly for Protection
<PB REF="6">
to the King him&s;elf. But the Author ought to have known, that it can ne|ver be the De&s;ign of &s;o good and &s;o wi&s;e a King, to &s;helter Error from the At|tacks of Rea&s;on: He ought to have known, that the King has declar'd his Intention to encourage real Merit, that Learning and Arts may flouri&s;h; by which Glory may accrue to His Reign, and Honour to <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>You know very well, Sir, that there has not been in <HI>Europe</HI> the&s;e thou&s;and Years a Prince more haughty than <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. a Prince more jealous of his Authority, and more ambitious of Glory: You know, Sir, that almo&s;t all his Poetical Subjects, who knew the darling Pa&s;&s;ion of his Soul, addre&s;s'd &s;ome of their Works to him. You know very well, Sir, that mo&s;t of them had been rewarded by him: And yet when <HI>BOILEAU,</HI> in a Di&s;cour&s;e addre&s;s'd to that King him&s;elf, and afterwards prefix|ed to his Works, expos'd and ridiculed the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e Pieces; you know very well, Sir, that that di&s;cern|ing
<PB REF="7">
Prince, who &s;aw that his true In|tere&s;t and his &s;olid Glory depended up|on the Advancement of Arts, and up|on the encouraging real Merit, was &s;o far from being offended with <HI>BOILEAU</HI> for the Liberty he took in that Di&s;|cour&s;e, that it recommended him to his Favour.</P>
<P>I do believe, from my very Soul, that 'tis the Intention of &s;o wi&s;e a Prince as the King, to encourage Arts and Learning; and I &s;hould have be|liev'd it, tho' the King had never told us &s;o, becau&s;e I know it to be his true Intere&s;t. And therefore I can never believe that 'tis the King's Intention any more to patronize Ignorance and Error in the Writings of his Subjects, than to protect their Vices and Follies of any other Kind. For Ignorance and Error, and Vice and Folly, mu&s;t e&s;trange the Hearts of his Subjects from him; only Ignorance and Error, and Vice and Folly, can favour and in|dulge that Super&s;tition, and that fal&s;e Religion, which are his mortal Enemies.
<PB REF="8">
And yet it has happen'd, by I know not what &s;ort of Caprice of Fortune, or of Fate, that Arts and Learning have, of late, &s;en&s;ibly, if not precipitately, de|clin'd. Never did &s;uch a Crowd of ill Plays and mi&s;erable Poems appear in &s;o &s;hort a Time: We have hardly &s;een one good one. And what is yet more &s;urpri&s;ing, the mo&s;t &s;tupid of all tho&s;e Plays and Poems, have been addre&s;s'd to the King him&s;elf. One would &s;wear, that the Authors were wild enough to expect, that Pen&s;ions, Gratuities, and Salaries, &s;hould be appointed to encourage Stu|pidity, and to mortify Sen&s;e and Me|rit. The very Boa&s;t and Glory of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mu&s;e is Comedy, in which <HI>Great Britain</HI> excels every other Coun|try: Nay, we can &s;hew more good, and more entertaining Comedies, than all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI> together. Du|ring the whole Reigns of King <HI>Charles,</HI> King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>William,</HI> there hardly pa&s;s'd a Year without one or two, and &s;ometimes three. During the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> alone, we
<PB REF="9">
had &s;even or eight very agreeable ones, only from two Gentlemen, Sir <HI>John Van|brugh</HI> and Mr. <HI>Congreve.</HI> But &s;ince that pernicious Licence was granted to four &s;ordid Players, during the late Queen's Time, we have hardly had one that has been worth one Farthing.</P>
<P>Sir, As the King, upon his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, came a Stranger among us, and as the Mini&s;try had then, and have had almo&s;t ever &s;ince, Affairs of greater and more immediate Impor|tance, than tho&s;e of the Theatre, the afore&s;aid Grant of the late Queen was unhappily renew'd; &s;ince which the Stage has yearly declin'd, and does de|cline daily; and every Branch of Hu|man Learning daily declines with it. <HI>Etenim omnes artes, quae ad Humanitatem pertinent, habeant quoddam commune vin|culum, &amp; qua&s;i cognatione quadam inter &s;e continentur.</HI> Thus all the Branches of Human Learning are like to be lo&s;t, or very much impair'd, unle&s;s you ge|nerou&s;ly undertake to &s;upport them. If the Condition in which they are,
<PB REF="10">
were but known to the King, I am confident, he would not &s;uffer them to be driven from among us during his Reign, as he regards either his own In|tere&s;t and Glory, or the Intere&s;t and Glory of the Nation which he governs. Nor is it beneath the greate&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t Mini&s;ter to take care of Arts and Letters. Two of the greate&s;t that ever were in the World, <HI>Maecenas</HI> and Car|dinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> are chiefly famous for the Protection they gave to them. Whenever, in any Nation, Human Learning has been diligently and im|partially cultivated, at that Time that Nation has flouri&s;h'd, its King has been glorious and belov'd, and his Mini&s;ters renowned and happy. I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN &s;ometime before the act|ing of Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Play, I ob&s;er|ved the &s;candalous Artifices that were practis'd to procure Succe&s;s to it, and was acquainted with the double Cheat which was to be impos'd on the Town, upon their Pockets, and upon their Under|&s;tandings, I thought I &s;hould de&s;erve the Fa|vour of the Publick, if I di&s;cover'd and pre|vented &s;o gro&s;s an Impo&s;ition, and &s;o palpable an Affront. But in&s;tead of meeting with the
<PB REF="12">
Thanks which I expected, and which I thought I had merited by the Service I intended them. I found my&s;elf in the &s;ame Situation that <HI>Sur|ly</HI> was, upon di&s;covering the Cheat in the <HI>Al|chymi&s;t</HI>; for not only <HI>Face</HI> and <HI>Subtle,</HI> who were Joynt-partners in carrying on this Po|etical Cheat made vehement Outcries, and &s;pread various Slanders, and engag'd &s;everal of their Bubbles to believe them, and di&s;per&s;e them, but they obliged the mo&s;t Sen&s;ele&s;s of all their Bubbles to repeat the Scurrility which they dictated to them. This immediately not only recall'd <HI>Butler</HI>'s Ver&s;es to my Remem|brance,</P>
<Q><L>Doubtle&s;s the Plea&s;ure is as great,</L>
<L>Of being cheated, as to cheat:</L>
<L>As Lookers-on feel mo&s;t Delight,</L>
<L>That lea&s;t perceive a Juggler's Slight,</L>
<L>And &s;till the le&s;s they under&s;tand,</L>
<L>The more th' admire his Slight of Hand;</L></Q>
<P>but made me &s;u&s;pect that <HI>Butler</HI> in this hardly came up to the full Truth, becau&s;e the fooli&s;h Part of the World loves more to be cheated, than the knavi&s;h Part does to cheat.
<PB REF="13">
The Generality of Mankind are &s;ure to love him, who impo&s;es on them, and to hate him who opens their Eyes; For he who cheats them, does it by entertaining &s;ome plea&s;ing Pa&s;&s;ion: But he who undeceives them, holds the Gla&s;s to them, and &s;hews them Truth and them&s;elves, a mortifying Sight. Now, when|ever you put a Man out of Conceit with him|&s;elf, you put him out of Humour with you likewi&s;e. All the Time the grand Cheat of the South Sea was carrying on by the fir&s;t Directors, I con&s;tantly ob&s;erv'd, that if any one at any Time was &s;o hardy as to tell any one of the Subcribers that he was cheated, it made him terribly out of humour with him who told him &s;o, and augmented his implicit Faith in the Directors who cheated him, and redoubled his Re&s;pect and E&s;teem for them.</P>
<P>The double Cheat above-mention'd, which was contriv'd by <HI>Face</HI> and <HI>Subtle</HI> in Concert, but executed cheifly by <HI>Subtle,</HI> was perhaps the mo&s;t audacious that ever was impos'd on the Capital of a great People, by Per&s;ons who pretended at the &s;ame Time to act by publick Authority: And I know not which is the
<PB REF="14">
more impudent Part of it; the u&s;ing &s;uch &s;candalous Methods, to make the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd and mo&s;t in&s;ipid Entertainment that ever came upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, pa&s;s for the very be&s;t, or the rai&s;ing the Prices for a Hum-drum Repre&s;entation, which they had nicknamed a Comedy, and the rai&s;ing them on the Account of the Scenes, for&s;ooth. Sir <HI>Wil|liam Davenant</HI> was the fir&s;t who brought Scenes upon the Stage, towards the Middle of the la&s;t Century; and to defray the Ex|pence of them, from time to time, rais'd the Theatrical Receipt above a third Part high|er than it was before. The Pit, which was before but eighteen Pence, was rais'd to Half a Crown; The Boxes, which were Half a Crown before, were advanc'd to four Shil|lings; the fir&s;t Gallery from a Shilling to eigh|teen Pence; and the upper Gallery, from Six|pence to a Shilling. So that, as I &s;aid before, there is above a third Part of each Night's Receipt, even at the common Prices, allow'd for the Scenes. Now what &s;hall we &s;ay of the&s;e mo&s;t &s;ordid Wretches, who&s;e Avarice is no more to be &s;atisfied than the barren Womb, or the Grave? They are not content|ed,
<PB REF="15">
it &s;eems, with getting, even at common Prices, each of them a thou&s;and or fifteen Hundred Pounds a Year, which enables them to live in &s;hameful Luxury, di&s;graceful to <HI>Great Britain</HI>: They are not contented to loll each of them in his gilded Chariot, as often as they vouch&s;afe, at their own Expence, to give the Publick a <HI>Farce</HI> without Doors, and to look down upon the tran&s;itory Bubles, who &s;upport them: They are not contented to en|joy their unmerited Gains, without paying any Thing out of them either to Poor or Publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">, and that at a Time when Offices, Salaries, Pen&s;ions, when every Mortal, every Thing is tax'd: They are not content to be thus un|accountably indulg'd; but at the &s;ame Time they mu&s;t impo&s;e upon the Publick, and wrong their Audiences of twelve hundred Pounds, as they certainly did, during, what, in their Theatrical Cant, they call the Run of their la&s;t <HI>Rhap&s;ody.</HI></P>
<P>Some People take Succe&s;s to be a Proof of Merit in Writers, whereas in the Degene|racy of Ta&s;te, if 'tis attended with a Cabal, 'tis a certain Proof of the want of it. All the <HI>Roman</HI> Satiri&s;ts were out of Humour with
<PB REF="16">
the &s;ucce&s;sful Scriblers of their Times, be|cau&s;e as it appears by what they &s;ay of them, they ow'd their Succe&s;s to Cabals, and to the repeating their Works to A&s;&s;emblies: Witne&s;s what <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Fannius</HI> in the <HI>4</HI>th Sa|tire of the fir&s;t Book.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Beatus Fannius, ultro</L>
<L>Delatis cap&s;is &amp; imagine: cum mea ne|mo</L>
<L>Scripta legat, vulgo recitare timentis&mdash;</L>

</Q>
<P>And what <HI>Juvenal</HI> &s;ays in the beginning of his fir&s;t Satire,</P>
<Q><L>Semper ego Auditor tantum? nunquamne reponam,</L>
<L>Vexatus toties Rauci The&s;eide Codri?</L>
<L>Ergo impune mihi recitaverit ille togatas</L><L>Hic elegos?</L></Q>
<P>But be&s;ides unde&s;erved Succe&s;s, the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Satiri&s;ts had another Provocation to Satire, and that was Hypocri&s;y, when Per|&s;ons who were void of all Morality pretend|ed to a more rigid Virtue than all the re&s;t of
<PB REF="17">
the World; and it was this chiefly that mov'd the Spleen of <HI>Lucilius,</HI> as <HI>Horace</HI> tells us in the fir&s;t Satire of his &s;econd Book.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;e&s;t Lucilius au&s;us</L>
<L>Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem,</L>
<L>Detrahere &amp; pellem, nitidus qu&acirc; qui&s;que per ora,</L>
<L>Cederet, intror&s;um turpis.</L></Q>
<P>But if &s;uch vile Wretches ever arrived to &s;uch a Height of Impudence as to pretend to teach Virtue to the re&s;t of the World, the Provocation then became in&s;upportable, and the Satiri&s;t began with Fury.</P>

As I make no doubt but that upon the publi&s;hing this little Treati&s;e there will be the &s;ame Outcries again&s;t Criticks and Criti|ci&s;m, which have been formerly &s;o often rai|&s;ed, I &s;hall lay before the Reader what the late Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> writ in Defence of them, with a great deal of good Sen&s;e, and Addre&s;s, and Penetration. The Pa&s;&s;age is in the <HI>230</HI>th Page of the fir&s;t Volume of the <HI>Characteri&s;ticks.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Nor &s;hould I &s;u&s;pect the Genius of our Writers, or charge them with Meanne&s;s and In&s;ufficiency on the account of this Low-&s;piritedne&s;s which they di&s;cover, were it not for another &s;ort of Fear, by which they more plainly betray them&s;elves, and &s;eem con&s;cious of their own Defects. The Criticks, it &s;eems, are formidable to 'em: TheCriticks are the dreadful Spectres, the Giants, the Enchanters, who traver&s;e and di&s;turb them in their Works: The&s;e are the Per&s;ecutors, for who&s;e Sakes they are ready to hide their Heads, begging Re&s;cue and Protection from all good Peo|ple, and flying in particular to the Great, by who&s;e Favour they hope to be defended
<PB REF="19">
from this mercile&s;s, examining Race; for what can be more cruel than to be forc'd to &s;ubmit to the rigorous Laws of Wit, and write under &s;uch &s;evere Judges as are deaf to all Court&s;hip, and can be wrought upon by no In&s;inuation or Flattery to pa&s;s by Faults, and pardon any Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of Art?</P><P>To judge, indeed, of the Circum&s;tances of a modern Author by the Pattern of his Prefaces, Dedications, and Introductions, one would think, that at the Moment, when a Piece of his was in hand, &s;ome Conjuration was forming again&s;t him, &s;ome diabolical Powers drawing together to bla&s;t his Work, and cro&s;s his generous De&s;ign; he therefore rouzes his Indigna|tion, hardens his Forehead, and with ma|ny furious Defiances and <HI>Avaunt-Satans!</HI> enters on his Bu&s;ine&s;s, not with the lea&s;t regard to what may ju&s;tly be objected to him in a way of Critici&s;m, but with an ab&s;olute Contempt of the Manner and Art it&s;elf.</P><P><HI>Odi profanum vulgus &amp; arceo,</HI> was in its time, no doubt, a generous Defiance;
<PB REF="20">
the <HI>Avaunt</HI> was natural and proper in its place, e&s;pecially where Religion and Vir|tue were the Poets Theme; but with our Moderns the Ca&s;e is generally the very rever&s;e, and accordingly the Defiance or <HI>Avaunt</HI> &s;hould run much after this man|ner. As for you vulgar Souls, mere Na|turals, who know no Art, were never ad|mitted into the Temple of Wi&s;dom, nor ever vi&s;ited the Sanctuaries of Wit or Learning, gather your&s;elves together from all Parts, and hearken to the Song or Tale I am about to utter; but for you Men of Science and Under&s;tanding, who have Ears and Judgment, and can weigh Sen&s;e, &s;can Syllables, and mea&s;ure Sounds; you who by a certain Art di&s;tingui&s;h fal&s;e Thought from true, Correctne&s;s from Rudene&s;s, and Bomba&s;t and Chaos from Order and the Sublime, away hence! or &s;tand aloof! whil&s;t I practi&s;e upon the Ea&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e mean Capacities and Ap|prehen&s;ions who make the mo&s;t numerous Audience, and are the only competent Judges of my Labours.</P><P><PB REF="21">
Accuracy of Workman&s;hip requires a Critick's Eye; 'tis lo&s;t upon a vulgar Judgment. Nothing grieves a real Arti&s;t, more than that Indifference of the Publick, which &s;uffers Work to pa&s;s uncriticiz'd. Nothing on the other Side, rejoices him, more than the nice View and In&s;pection of the accurate Examiner, and Judge of Work: 'Tis the mean Genius, the &s;lovenly Performer, who knowing nothing of true Workman&s;hip, endeavours by the be&s;t outward Glo&s;s, and dazzling Shew, to turn the Eye from a direct and &s;teddy Survey of his Piece.</P><P>What is there which an expert Mu&s;ician more de&s;ires than to perform his Part in in the Pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who are knowing in his Art? 'Tis to the Ear alone he applies him&s;elf; the critical, the nice Ear. Let his Hearers be of what Character they plea&s;e: Be they naturally au&s;tere, moro&s;e, or rigid; no matter &s;o they are Criticks, able to cen&s;ure, remark, and &s;ound every Accord and Symphony. What is there mortifies the good Painter, more than when amid&s;t his admiring Spectators, there is not one pre&s;ent who has been us'd to compare the
<PB REF="22">
Hands of different Ma&s;ters, or has an Eye to di&s;tingui&s;h the Advantages or Defects of every Stile? Thro' all the inferior Orders of Mechanicks, the Rule is found to hold the &s;ame: In every Science, every Art, the real Ma&s;ters, or Proficients, rejoice in no|thing more, than in the thorough Search and Examination of their Performances by all the Rules of Art, and nice&s;t Cri|tici&s;m. Why therefore (in the Mu&s;es Name) is it not the &s;ame with our Pre|tenders to the Writing Art; our Poets and Pro&s;e Authors of every kind? Why, in this Profe&s;&s;ion are we found &s;uch Cri|tick-Haters, and indulg'd in this unlearn'd Aver&s;ion, unle&s;s it be taken for granted that as Wit and Learning &s;tand at pre&s;ent, in our Nation, we are &s;till upon the Foot of Empiricks and Mountebanks.</P><P>From the&s;e Con&s;iderations, I take upon me ab&s;olutely to condemn the fa&s;hionable Cu&s;tom of inveighing again&s;t <HI>Criticks,</HI> as the common Enemies, the Pe&s;ts, and Incen|diaries of the Commonwealth of Wit and Letters. I a&s;&s;ert, on the contrary, that they are the Props and Pillars of this Building;
<PB REF="23">
and that without the Encouragement and Propagation of this Race, we &s;hould re|main as <HI>Gothick Architects</HI> as ever.</P></Q>
<P>Thus far the late mo&s;t ingenious and mo&s;t ju|dicious Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> has gone in the De|fence of Criticks and Critici&s;m. I &s;hall de&s;ire to &s;ay a little in my own particular Defence: I have been long &s;ince repre&s;ented, by Per|&s;ons who have never read what I have writ, as one who likes nothing, and one who makes it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to find out Faults, and never di&s;covers Beauties: Upon my publi&s;hing lately the Defence of Sir <HI>Fopling Flutter,</HI> this Accu&s;ation was renew'd, tho' it was a Contradiction in Terms. It being impo&s;&s;ible that any one can write a Defence of a <HI>Drama|tick</HI> Poem, which he does not like; or com|mend a Comedy, in which he finds no Beauties. The Truth of this Affair is, that no <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Author of any Note has commended &s;o many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets, as I have: I &s;hall give a Li&s;t of &s;ome of them; <HI>Shake&s;pear, Ben John&s;on, Milton, Butler, Ro&s;comon, Denham, Waller, Dryden, Wycherly, Otway, Etherege, Shadwell, Crown, Congreve, Phillips.</HI> The&s;e are &s;ome of tho&s;e whom I have occa&s;ionally

<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE PREFACE TO THE <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Author tells us in the Begin|ning of his Preface, That <HI>this Comedy has been receiv'd with univer&s;al Acceptance.</HI> Whether he is in the Right, or not, I ap|peal to the World. The Rea&s;on which he gives for this univer&s;al Acceptance is very extraordinary: <HI>It has been receiv'd,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>with univer&s;al Acceptance, for it was in every Part excellently perform'd.</HI> Is it not a plea|&s;ant
<PB N="2" REF="26">
Humility in a Dramatick Writer, to affirm, that he is indebted for his whole Succe&s;s to the Actors? I was apt to believe, at the fir&s;t Sight, that this was an affected Mode&s;ty, and a counterfeit Humility. But when I went a little further, I began to think I was mi&s;taken, and that the Author was in ear|ne&s;t; for he &s;eems to be apprehen&s;ive, that the Applau&s;e of the Reader would hardly be &s;o general as was that of the Spectator; and he does his Endeavour to induce the Reader not to pa&s;s a Judgment of the Play, till he has &s;een it acted: <HI>It mu&s;t be remembred,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that a Play is to be &s;een, and is made to be repre&s;ented with the Advantage of Actors, nor can appear but with half the Spirit without it.</HI> Now there have been &s;eve|ral Plays writ in &s;everal Languages, which were never de&s;ign'd to be &s;een. There are two of our own: The Tragedy of <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> by <HI>Milton</HI>; and the <HI>State of In|nocence,</HI> by <HI>Dryden.</HI> 'Tis true, indeed, mo&s;t Plays are de&s;ign'd by their Authors to be &s;een, but that is not the chief De&s;ign of a Dramatick Writer, who has a good Genius. For &s;uch an Author writes to all Countries, and to all Ages, and writes with the lively Hope, that his great Ma&s;ter-pieces &s;hall out|live the very Language in which they are compos'd. When Sir <HI>Richard</HI> &s;ays, That a Play can appear but with half the Spirit, un|le&s;s we &s;ee it acted, I would fain ask, on whom he de&s;igns to impo&s;e this? If he who
<PB N="3" REF="27">
reads a Play is qualified to read and to judge, he reads it with a truer and ju&s;ter Spirit than can be &s;upplied by any Company of Actors. If &s;uch a Reader happens at any Time to be better plea&s;ed with the Repre&s;entation of a Play than the reading it, 'tis an infallible Sign, that &s;uch a Play is a very wretched Performance.</P>
<P>But let us &s;ee how Sir <HI>Richard</HI> goes on. <HI>The greate&s;t Effect,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>of a Play in reading it, is to excite the Reader to go &s;ee it; and when he does &s;o, it is then a Play has the Effect of Precept and Example.</HI> Good God! is it po&s;&s;ible that this could come from any one but a Man who is re|&s;olv'd to &s;hew that he takes all his Readers to be Ideots? When we read the Tragedies of <HI>Sophocles</HI> or <HI>Euripides,</HI> or the Comedies of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes, Plautus,</HI> or <HI>Terence,</HI> is the greate&s;t Effect they have upon us, the exciting us to go to &s;ee them acted? When Sir <HI>Richard</HI> read the <HI>Andria</HI> of <HI>Terence,</HI> was the exciting him to go to &s;ee it acted the greate&s;t Effect that it had upon him? No, the greate&s;t Ef|fect that it had upon him, was the De&s;ire to &s;ee another Play acted, and that was his own deplorable Imitation of the <HI>Andria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But a Play,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>has only, in the Re|pre&s;entation, the Effect of Example and Precept.</HI> So that 'tis not the Dramatick Per&s;ons, it &s;eems, 'tis not <HI>Timoleon, Scipio, Bontus,</HI> who are to be the Examples of Vir|tue
<PB N="4" REF="28">
to us; no, 'tis the Players, I warrant, who repre&s;ent them; 'tis Mr. <HI>Booth,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ro|bert Wilks,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Colley Cibber,</HI> who&s;e Heroick Virtue we are to imitate, and by who&s;e Actions we are to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Richard</HI> goes on, and tells us, That the chief De&s;ign of the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers</HI> was to be an innocent Performance. Now there are a hundred innocent Performances upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Stage: But perhaps he meant a Performance that &s;hould have nothing but its Innocence to recommend it, and &s;hould, by con&s;equence, be thought the only Play of its Kind. But in that he is mi&s;taken, for there is one more, and that is, the Perfor|mance of <HI>Bays</HI> in the <HI>Rehear&s;al,</HI> which is, indeed, incoherent, incongruous, imperti|nent, in&s;ipid, and ridiculous; but certainly a very innocent Performance. I am afraid it will appear by the following Sheets, that the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers</HI> has no &s;mall Share of &s;ome of the&s;e Qualities, and has nothing valuable but barely the Cata&s;trophe. And here I can|not but ob&s;erve, that Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> who has upon &s;o many Occa&s;ions inveigh'd again&s;t the Rules, and particularly, in that notable Pa|per call'd the <HI>Theatre,</HI> owes the only enter|taining Scene of his Play to the Ob&s;ervation of a Rule of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> which is, That the Di&s;covery &s;hould be immediately follow'd by the Change of Fortune, that is, by the Ca|ta&s;trophe. Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> indeed, without ever
<PB N="5" REF="29">
dreaming of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> had it from <HI>Terence,</HI> who took it from <HI>Menander,</HI> who had it from the Precept of that great Philo&s;opher, and from the Practice of <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Eu|ripides.</HI> For the tragick and comick Poets frequently borrow'd their Hints from one another; but, at the &s;ame time, took Care to do it with Judgment, and not to intrench upon each other's Province. And therefore we &s;ee, that the Di&s;covery in <HI>Terence,</HI> and the Reconciliation of <HI>Simo</HI> to <HI>Pamphilus,</HI> is comprehended in a narrow Compa&s;s, and has nothing in it of tho&s;e violent Tran&s;ports of Grief which are incon&s;i&s;tent with Co|medy.</P>
<Q><L>Ver&s;ibus exponi Tragicis res comica non vult,</L></Q>
<P>&s;ays <HI>Horace</HI> in his <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> which <HI>Boileau</HI> has imitated in the two following Lines of his</P>
<Q><L>Le Comique ennemi des &s;oupirs &amp; des pleurs</L>
<L>N'admet point en &s;oi des Tragiques Douleurs.</L></Q>
<P>But I beg the Reader's Pardon for this Digre&s;&s;ion, and now return to the Preface.</P>
<P>As to the Quarrel in the fourth Act, I &s;hall &s;peak to it in its Place. In the mean time I am of the Number of tho&s;e, who believe that this Incident, and the Ca&s;e of the Fa|ther and Daughter, are not the proper Sub|jects
<PB N="6" REF="30">
of Comedy. When Sir <HI>Richard</HI> &s;ays, that any thing that has its Foundation in Happi|ne&s;s and Succe&s;s mu&s;t be the Subject of Co|medy, he confounds Comedy with that Species of Tragedy which has a happy Ca|ta&s;trophe. When he &s;ays, that 'tis an Im|provement of Comedy to introduce a Joy too exqui&s;ite for Laughter, he takes all the Care that he can to &s;hew, that he knows nothing of the Nature of Comedy. Does he really believe that <HI>Moliere</HI> under&s;tood the Nature of it: I &s;ay <HI>Moliere,</HI> who, in the Opinion of all <HI>Europe,</HI> excepting that &s;mall Portion of it which is acquainted with <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> had born away the Prize of Comedy from all Na|tions, and from all Ages, if for the &s;ake of his Profit, he had not de&s;cended &s;ometimes too much to Buffoonry. Let Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> or any one, look into that little Piece of <HI>Moliere,</HI> call'd, <HI>La Critique de l'Ecole des Femmes,</HI> and he &s;hall find there, that in <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Opinion, 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Comick Poet to enter into the Ridicule of Men, and to expo&s;e the blind Sides of all Sorts of People agreeably; that he does nothing at all, if he does not draw the Pictures of his Contem|poraries, and does not rai&s;e the Mirth of the &s;en&s;ible Part of an Audience, which, &s;ays he, 'tis no ea&s;y Matter to do. This is the Sen&s;e of <HI>Moliere,</HI> tho' the Words are not his exactly.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="31">
When Sir <HI>Richard</HI> talks of a Joy too exqui|&s;ite for Laughter, he &s;eems not to know that Joy, generally taken, is common like Anger, Indignation, Love, to all Sorts of Poetry, to the Epick, the Dramatick, the Lyrick; but that that kind of Joy which is attended with Laughter, is the Characteri&s;tick of Comedy; as Terror or Compa&s;&s;ion, according as one or the other is predominant, makes the Cha|racteri&s;tick of Tragedy, as Admiration does of Epick Poetry.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>Richard</HI> &s;ays, That weeping upon the Sight of a deplorable Object is not a Sub|ject for Laughter, but that 'tis agreeable to good Sen&s;e and to Humanity, he &s;ays nothing but what all the &s;en&s;ible Part of the World has already granted; but then all that &s;en&s;ible Part of the World have always deny'd, that a deplorable Object is fit to be &s;hewn in Comedy. When Sir <HI>George Etherege,</HI> in his Comedy of <HI>Sir Fopling Flutter,</HI> &s;hews <HI>Loveit</HI> in all the Height and Violence of Grief and Rage, the Judicious Poet takes care to give tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions a ridiculous Turn by the Mouth of <HI>Dorimant.</HI> Be&s;ides that, the Subject is at the Bottom ridiculous: For <HI>Loveit</HI> is a Mi&s;tre&s;s, who has abandon'd her &s;elf to <HI>Dorimant</HI>; and by falling into the&s;e violent Pa&s;&s;ions, only becau&s;e &s;he fancies that &s;omething of which &s;he is very de&s;irous has gone be&s;ide her, makes her&s;elf truly ridicu|lous. Thus is this famous Scene in the &s;e|cond
<PB N="8" REF="32">
Act of <HI>Sir Foppling,</HI> by the Charac|ter of <HI>Loveit,</HI> and the dextrous handling the Subject, kept within the Bounds of Come|dy: But the Scene of the Di&s;covery in the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers</HI> is truly Tragical. <HI>Indiana</HI> was &s;trictly virtuous: She had indeed con|ceiv'd a violent Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Bevil</HI>; but all young People in full Health are liable to &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, and perhaps the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and the mo&s;t virtuous are more than others lia|ble: But be&s;ides, that &s;he had kept this Pa&s;&s;ion within the Bounds of Honour, it was the natural Effect of her E&s;teem for her Be|nefactor, and of her Gratitude, that is, of her Virtue. The&s;e Con&s;iderations render'd her Ca&s;e deplorable, and the Cata&s;trophe down|right tragical, which of a Comedy ought to be the mo&s;t comical Part, for the &s;ame Rea|&s;on that it ought to be the mo&s;t tragical Part of a Tragedy.</P>
<P>Before I take my Leave of Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Preface, I cannot help &s;aying a Word to his Song, which he has brought in here by Violence, to the great Surprize of the Rea|der, for no other End, than to &s;hew that he is as notable at Metre as he is at Pro&s;e. He &s;eems as much concern'd for the Omi&s;&s;ion of it in the Repre&s;entation of his, as <HI>Bays</HI> in the third Act of the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI> is for the Neglect of his; nay, and to have as high an Opinion of it, as that merry Bard di&s;|covers that he has of his, when he &s;ays to
<PB N="9" REF="33">
<HI>John&s;on, What! are they gone without &s;ing|ing my la&s;t new Song? 's Bud, would it were in their Bellies. I'll tell you, Mr.</HI> John&s;on<HI>, if I have any Skill in the&s;e Matters, I vow to Gad this Song is peremptorily the very be&s;t that ever yet was written: You mu&s;t know it was made by</HI> Tom Thimble<HI>'s fir&s;t Wife, after &s;he was dead.</HI></P>
<P>So that this Song of Mr. <HI>Bays</HI> too, as well as his Brother Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s, is a Love-Song, de&s;ign'd ju&s;t as judiciou&s;ly, expre&s;s'd ju&s;t as pa&s;&s;ionately, but more harmoniou&s;ly, more freely, and better contriv'd for Me|lody. And yet from the Omi&s;&s;ion of this Song of his, does Sir <HI>Richard</HI> take an occa&s;ion to affront the fine&s;t Arti&s;t of his kind in the World, and to treat Signor <HI>Carbonelli</HI> like a Country Fidler, who &s;ings <HI>John Dory</HI> at Wakes and Fairs to Hobnail'd Pea&s;ants and Milk-Maids.</P>
<P>I thought here to take my Leave; but the Sight of <HI>Terence</HI> and <HI>Cibber</HI> together pro|vokes me to go a little farther.</P>
<Q><L>Jungentur jam gryphes equis: aevoque &s;equenti</L>
<L>Cum canibus timidi venient ad pocula damae.</L>
<BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard</HI> &s;ays, that he is extremely &s;ur|priz'd to find what <HI>Cibber</HI> told him prove a Truth, that what he valued him&s;elf &s;o much upon, the Tran&s;lation of <HI>Terence</HI> &s;hould be
<PB N="10" REF="34">
imputed to him as a Reproach. Sir <HI>Richard</HI> knew very well, that <HI>Cibber</HI> had &s;aid &s;o many fal&s;e Things with relation to this Play, that he might be very well &s;urpriz'd to find Truth come from him, e&s;pecially upon that Subject. But Sir <HI>Richard</HI> is mi&s;taken; <HI>Cibber</HI> is con&s;tant to him&s;elf, and does not deviate from Fal&s;|hood upon this Occa&s;ion. No Mortal re|proaches Sir <HI>Richard</HI> with his Tran&s;lation of <HI>Terence.</HI> He has &s;hewn clearly, that he is not capable of tran&s;lating any one Scene of him. But tho' he had been never &s;o capable, he ought to have known that a Tran&s;la|tion of <HI>Terence,</HI> by the be&s;t Hand in the World, would not &s;ucceed upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage. He ought to have known the De|fect, that the <HI>Romans</HI> them&s;elves, who liv'd &s;ome time after him, and e&s;pecially <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> found in that Comick Poet. The great Ob|jection to him was, that he wanted the co|mick Force, that is to &s;ay, that he had not in his Comedies that Humour and Plea|&s;antry which are &s;o agreeable to the Nature of Comedy. For the Force of any kind of Writing con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in that which di|&s;tingui&s;hes it from all other Kinds. Now the Ridicule being that which di&s;tingui&s;hes Comedy from every other kind of Poetry, the <HI>Comick Force</HI> mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in that. But how came it to pa&s;s then, that five of the &s;ix Comedies of <HI>Terence</HI> &s;ucceeded upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Stage? The An&s;wer is plain, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="35">
the Generality of the <HI>Romans,</HI> at the Time they were writ, knew no better. The <HI>Roman</HI> Comedy in general had but little of that agreeable Plea&s;antry that is fit to divert Men of Sen&s;e, which occa&s;ion'd the follow|ing Cen&s;ure of <HI>Quintilian</HI>: <HI>In Comaedia maxime claudicamus: licet</HI> Varro <HI>dicat Mu|&s;as,</HI> Aelii Stolonis <HI>&s;ententia,</HI> Plautino <HI>&s;er|mone locuturas fui&s;&s;e, &s;i latin&egrave; loqui vellent: licet Caecilium veteres laudibus ferant: licet</HI> Terentii <HI>&s;cripta ad</HI> Scipionem Africanum <HI>referantur: quae tamen &s;unt in hoc genere eleganti&s;&s;ima, &amp; plus adhuc habitura gratiae &s;i intra Ver&s;us trimetros &s;teti&s;&s;ent. Vix le|vem con&s;equimur umbram, adeo ut mihi &s;er|mo ip&s;e</HI> Romanus <HI>non recipere videatur illam &s;olis conce&s;&s;am Atticis venerem, quando eam ne</HI> Graeci <HI>quidem in alio genere linguae obtinu|erint.</HI> And therefore, when <HI>Shadwell</HI> un|dertook to write a Comedy upon the Plan of the <HI>Adelphi,</HI> he, who very well knew the Nature of his Art, and by con&s;equence knew what was defective in the <HI>Roman</HI> Comedy, took particular Care to &s;upply from his own Invention the Ridicule that was wanting in that; and it was by u&s;ing that Me|thod that he made the <HI>Squire of Al&s;atia</HI> a very good and very entertaining Comedy. <HI>Moliere,</HI> who writ upon the &s;ame Plan, has done the very &s;ame Thing in his <HI>L'Ecole des Maris.</HI> He has done the very &s;ame in his <HI>Fourberies de Scapin,</HI> which is writ upon
<PB N="12" REF="36">
the Plan of the <HI>Phormio</HI>; but in the latter, he has gone too far, and &s;hamefully, to u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Boileau,</HI> coupled <HI>Terence</HI> with <HI>Jack-Pudding</HI>; a Conjunction as &s;can|dalous as Sir <HI>Richard</HI> had made of <HI>Terence</HI> and his Friend <HI>Cibber:</HI> I heartily congratulate both of them upon this their mutual Friend|&s;hip. They are <HI>par nobile fratrum,</HI> a Pair &s;o pious, &s;o good, &s;o human, &s;o virtuous, &s;o religious, that they are perfectly &s;ecur'd, even in the mid&s;t of a treacherous World, of each other's mutual Fidelity; becau&s;e there is not in the World that Third Per&s;on who is fit to be a Friend to either. The Knight was too humble, when he attributed the great Suc|ce&s;s of his Play to the Players in general; the Succe&s;s is only due to him&s;elf, and to his virtuous Friend; that is, to that Cabal which was &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly conven'd by them, and to tho&s;e Artifices which were with &s;o much Skill conducted by them. They have done greater Services than this for each other, and have &s;ecured the Stage to them&s;elves alone, which they regard as their proper <HI>Domain,</HI> and therefore every Stranger who for the fu|ture comes upon their Ground, is to be e&s;teem'd a Tre&s;pa&s;&s;er. In the mean Time, they have re&s;olved between them&s;elves, to make the Town &s;wallow any Entertainment which they &s;hall think fit to provide for them; and they &s;eem agreed to vouch for each other. <HI>Cibber</HI> is to make Affidavit, that the Knight's
<PB N="13" REF="37">
Gudgeons are Cod-Fi&s;h and Sea-Carp, that arriv'd by the la&s;t Fi&s;h-Pool; and the Knight is to give it upon his immaculate Honour, that <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Strickle-Bats and Millers-Thumbs are either Mullets or Turbuts. And they &s;eem to have made a formal Order, That the Town &s;hall believe them, under the Pe|nalty of being treated with the &s;ame Ana|thema's that <HI>Martin</HI> and <HI>John</HI> were treated by <HI>Peter</HI> in the <HI>Tale of a Tub</HI>; that is, if you will not give Credit to what we tell you, rather than believe your Sen&s;es, G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d eternally damn you. <HI>Cibber</HI> indeed has re|ceiv'd &s;ome tran&s;itory Rebukes upon taking this Re&s;olution; but he &s;till keeps firm to his Point, and is re&s;olved to carry it.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE determin'd to make &s;ome Remarks, with Brevity and Im|partiallity, upon a late Drama|tick Performance, call'd, <HI>The Con&s;cious Lovers,</HI> a Comedy: That I may be then certainly able to determine whether the great Succe&s;s of it is owing to un|common Merit, or to tho&s;e extraordinary in|famous Methods which I have lately taken Notice of in a former Treati&s;e, and which, if there is not a &s;udden Stop put to them, will occa&s;ion the utter Downfal of the Stage, and of all the Arts dependent on it.</P>
<P>'Tis an Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> in the &s;ixteenth Chapter of his <HI>Poeticks,</HI> that there &s;hould be no Incident in the Action of a Tragedy, which &s;hould be without its Rea|&s;on, becau&s;e the Ab&s;urdity of the Incidents
<PB N="15" REF="39">
would de&s;troy the Probability of the Action, and turn poetical Fiction into downright Fal&s;hood. Now, if upon this Account 'tis requir'd that all the Incidents &s;hould be rea|&s;onable in Tragedy, 'tis &s;till more requi&s;ite in Comedy, where the Probable is more ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and the Wonderful le&s;s tolerable. But now this whole Dramatick Performance &s;eems to me to be built upon &s;everal Things which have no Foundation, either in Pro|bability, or in Rea&s;on, or Nature. The Father of <HI>Indiana,</HI> who&s;e Name is <HI>Danvers,</HI> and who was formerly an eminent Merchant at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> upon his Arrival from the <HI>Indies,</HI> from whence he returns with a great E&s;tate, carries on a very great Trade at <HI>London</HI> un|known to his Friends and Relations at <HI>Bri&s;|tol,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Sealand.</HI> Now this Fiction, without which there could be no Comedy, nor any thing call'd a Comedy, is not &s;upported by Probability, or by Rea&s;on, or Nature. 'Tis true, he tells his Daugh|ter, in the fifth Act, towards the Top of the 82d Page, That when his Misfortunes drove him to the <HI>Indies,</HI> for Rea&s;ons too tedious to be mention'd at the Time he &s;poke, he chang'd his Name of <HI>Danvers</HI> into <HI>Sealand.</HI> When his Misfortunes drove him out of his Country, tho&s;e Misfortunes were Rea&s;ons &s;ufficient to account for the changing his Name. But is it probable, that at his Ar|rival in the <HI>Indies,</HI> or at his Return to <HI>Eng|land</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="40">
with a va&s;t E&s;tate, he &s;hould &s;till retain the Name of <HI>Sealand?</HI> Is it natural to be|lieve, that under that borrow'd Name he &s;hould conceal him&s;elf from his Family and all his Relations, as it appears by what his Daughter &s;ays, <HI>Act</HI> II. <HI>Page</HI> 30. that he does? Is it credible, that he could be &s;uch a Mon&s;ter, as never to &s;end to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> after his Arrival from the <HI>Indies,</HI> to enquire after his Wife, his Si&s;ter, and his Daughter? and that he &s;hould feloniou&s;ly marry a &s;econd Wife, without ever knowing what was be|come of the fir&s;t? Is it rea&s;onable to be|lieve, that if he could be ab&s;urd enough to de&s;ign this, he could ever po&s;&s;ibly effect it? Is it po&s;&s;ible that a Man can return from the <HI>Indies</HI> with a va&s;t E&s;tate, and the World &s;hould not know either what he is, or what he was when he went thither, e&s;pecially when he traded to every Part of the Globe? Is there &s;o much as one Man in <HI>England</HI> with a va&s;t E&s;tate, who&s;e Original is not known? Or was there ever any one great Merchant of <HI>London,</HI> who&s;e Family and Original was not known to the Merchants at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> when betwixt the one and the other there is always &s;o &s;trict and con&s;tant a Communication?</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, the filial Obedience of young <HI>Bevil</HI> is carried a great deal too far. He is &s;aid to be one of a great E&s;tate, and a great Under&s;tanding; and yet he makes a Promi&s;e to his Father, not to marry without his Con|&s;ent,
<PB N="17" REF="41">
which is a Promi&s;e that can do his Fa|ther only a vain imaginary Good, and may do him real Hurt. A young Man of a great Under&s;tanding, cannot but know, that if he makes &s;uch a Promi&s;e, he may be oblig'd to break it, or peri&s;h, or, at lea&s;t, be unhappy all the re&s;t of his Life. Such a one cannot but know, that he may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;eiz'd with a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, and &s;o violent, that he mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s, or peri&s;h; and con&s;e|quently, if the Woman who in&s;pires this Pa&s;&s;ion, be a Woman of &s;trict Virtue, he mu&s;t marry, or peri&s;h, or, at lea&s;t, be mor|tally unea&s;y for the re&s;t of his Life. Chil|dren, indeed, before they come to Years of Di&s;cretion are oblig'd to pay a blind Obe|dience to their Parents. But after they are come to the full U&s;e of their Rea&s;on, they are only bound to obey them in what is rea|&s;onable. Indeed, if a Son is in Expectation of an E&s;tate from his Father, he is engag'd to a good deal of Compliance, even after he comes to Years of Di&s;cretion. But that was not <HI>Bevil</HI>'s Ca&s;e: He enjoy'd a very good one of his Mother's, by vertue of a Marriage Ar|ticle; and therefore it was unrea&s;onable in him to make &s;uch a Promi&s;e to his Father, as it was unrea&s;onable in his Father to urge him to it, e&s;pecially upon &s;o &s;ordid a Motive as the doubling a great E&s;tate. This is acting in a manner &s;omething arbitrary. And it ill becomes an Author, who would be thought
<PB N="18" REF="42">
a Patron of Liberty, to &s;uppo&s;e that Fathers are ab&s;olute, when Kings them&s;elves are li|mitted. If he had not an Under&s;tanding of his own to tell him this, he might have learn'd from Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> in his &s;ixth Chap|ter of his admirable <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Government: That every Man has a Right to his natural Freedom, without being &s;ubjected to the Will or Authority of any other Man. Children, I confe&s;s,</HI> &s;ays that great Man, <HI>are not born in this full State of Equality, though they are born to it. Their Parents have a &s;ort of Rule and Juri&s;diction over them when they come into the World, and for &s;ome Time after; but 'tis,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but a temporary one. The Bonds of this Subjection are like the Swadling Clothes which they are wrapp'd up in, and &s;upported by in the Weakne&s;s of their Infancy: Age and Rea&s;on, as they grow up, loo&s;en them, till at length they drop quite off, and leave a Man at his own free Di&s;po&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Author a little after adds, <HI>That God having given Man an Under&s;tanding to direct his Actions, has allowed him a Free|dom of Will, and Liberty of acting, as pro|perly belonging thereunto, within the Bounds of that Law he is under. But while he is in an E&s;tate wherein he has no Under&s;tand|ing of his own to direct his Will, he is not to have any Will of his own to follow; he that under&s;tands for him, mu&s;t will for him too; he mu&s;t pre&s;cribe to his Will, and re|gulate</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="43">
<HI>his Actions: But when he comes to the E&s;tate that made his Father a Freeman, the Son is a Freeman too.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This holds,</HI> &s;ays that great Man, <HI>in all the Laws a Man is under, whether Natural or Civil. Is a Man under the Law of Na|ture? What made him free of that Law? What gave him a free di&s;po&s;ing of his Pro|perty according to his own Will, within the Compa&s;s of that Law? I an&s;wer, a State of Maturity, wherein he might be &s;uppos'd capable to know that Law, that &s;o he might keep his Actions within the Bounds of it. When he has acquir'd that State, he is pre|&s;um'd to know how far that Law is to be his Guide, and how far he may make u&s;e of his Freedom; and &s;o comes to have it: Till then &s;ome body el&s;e mu&s;t guide him, who is pre&s;um'd to know how far the Law allows a Liberty. If &s;uch a State of Rea&s;on, &s;uch an Age of Di&s;cretion made him free, the &s;ame &s;hall make his Son free too. Is a Man under the Law of</HI> England<HI>? What made him free of that Law; that is, to have the Li|berty to di&s;po&s;e of his Actions and Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions according to his own Will, within the Permi&s;&s;ion of that Law? A Capacity of knowing that Law, which is &s;uppos'd by that Law at the Age of Twenty one, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es &s;ooner. If this made the Fa|ther free, it &s;hall make the Son free too. Till then we &s;ee the Law allows the Son</HI><PB N="20" REF="44">
<HI>to have no Will, but he is to be guided by the Will of his Father, or Guardian, who is to under&s;tand for him. And if the Father die, and fail to &s;ub&s;titute a Deputy in this Tru&s;t, if he has not provided a Deputy to govern his Son during his Minority, during his want of Under&s;tanding, the Law takes care to do it; &s;ome other mu&s;t govern him, and be a Will to him till he has attain'd to a State of Freedom, and his Under&s;tanding be fit to take the Government of his Will. But after that the Father and Son are equal|ly free, as much as a Tutor and Pupil after Nonage, equally Subjects of the &s;ame Law together, without any Dominion left in the Father over the Life, Liberty, or E&s;tate of the Son, whether they be only in the State, and under the Law of Nature, or under the po&s;itive Laws of an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that this Quotation has been a great deal too long; and yet to &s;et the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of <HI>Bevil</HI>'s Promi&s;e in a full Light, I am oblig'd to add what the &s;ame Author &s;ays a little lower in the very &s;ame Chapter, <HI>viz. The Power of the Father extends not to the Laws, or Goods, which either his Children's Indu&s;try, or another's Bounty has made theirs, nor to their Li|berty neither, when they are once arriv'd to the Enfranchi&s;ement of the Years of Di&s;|cretion. The Father's Empire then cea&s;es; and he can from thence-forwards no more</HI><PB N="21" REF="45">
<HI>di&s;po&s;e of the Liberty of his Son, than of any other Man. And it mu&s;t be far from an ab|&s;olute or perpetual Juri&s;diction, from which a Man may withdraw him&s;elf; having Li|cen&s;e from divine Authority, to leave Fa|ther and Mother, and cleave to his Wife.</HI></P>
<P>From what I have quoted from &s;o judi|cious and &s;o penetrating an Author, I think it is pretty plain, that young <HI>Bevil,</HI> who di&s;pos'd of part of his E&s;tate without, nay, and as he might rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, again&s;t the Con&s;ent of his Father, might <HI>&agrave; fortiori</HI> have di&s;pos'd of his Per&s;on too, if it had not been for his unrea&s;onable Promi&s;e; and that 'tis highly improbable, that one of the E&s;tate and Under&s;tanding, which he is &s;aid to have, &s;hould ab&s;urdly make a Promi&s;e which might po&s;&s;ibly endanger the Happi|ne&s;s of his whole Life. 'Tis &s;aid, indeed, in more than one Place of the Play, that the Son has uncommon Obligations to his Father; but we are neither told, nor are we able to gue&s;s what tho&s;e Obligations are. What uncommon Obligations can a Son, who has a great E&s;tate in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, have to a Father of &s;o &s;ordid a Nature as Sir <HI>John Bevil</HI> &s;hews him&s;elf? <HI>Act</HI> 4. <HI>Page</HI> 65. Be&s;ides, what Obligations can be binding enough to make a Man of a great E&s;tate part with Liberty, with the very Liberty of his Choice, in the mo&s;t important Action of his Life, upon which the Happine&s;s of all the re&s;t depends.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="46">
But as unrea&s;onable as this Promi&s;e is, which young <HI>Bevil</HI> made to his Father, by which he gave away his Birthright, his Liberty, yes, the very Liberty of his Choice, in an Affair upon which his Happine&s;s mo&s;t de|pended, his Behaviour to <HI>Indiana</HI> is &s;till more unaccountable: He loves her, and is beloved by her; makes con&s;tant Vi&s;its and profu&s;e Pre&s;ents to her; and yet conceals his Pa&s;&s;ion from her; which may be per|haps a clum&s;y Expedient for the Author's preparing the Di&s;covery, but is neither a|greeable to Nature nor Rea&s;on: For 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible that any young Man in Nature in Health and Vigour, and in the Height of a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, can &s;o far command him|&s;elf by the meer Force of Rea&s;on. I am wil|ling, indeed, to allow that he may be able to do it by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the true Reli|gion: But the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Comick Poet is only to teach Morality: Grace is not taught, but in&s;pir'd. The dreadful My&s;teries of Chri&s;tianity are but ill compatible with the Lightne&s;s and Mirth of Comedy; or with the Ob&s;cenity and Prophane&s;s of a degenerate Stage, or with the Di&s;po&s;itions of an A&s;|&s;embly, compos'd of Per&s;ons who have &s;ome of them no Religion, and &s;ome of them not the true one. Be&s;ides that, nothing but a Doctrine taken from the moral Law can be a ju&s;t Foundation of a Fable; which every true Comedy is.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="47">
Nor is &s;uch a Behaviour any more agreeable to Rea&s;on, than it is to Nature: <HI>Bevil</HI> loves <HI>Indiana,</HI> and is beloved by her: She adores him, &s;he dies for him, and he knows it: He ob&s;erves it; and ob&s;erves at the &s;ame Time that &s;o violent a Pa&s;&s;ion is attended with equal Anxiety; and that Anxiety is entirely caus'd by the perplexing Doubt &s;he is in, whether &s;he is beloved, or not, as appears by what he &s;ays him&s;elf, <HI>Act</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 27. Why then doth he not declare him&s;elf, and by that Declaration compo&s;e her Mind, and qualify her to expect with Patience the Benefit of Time. 'Tis indeed true, that he had pro|mis'd his Father never to marry without his Con&s;ent, while his Father liv'd; but he had not promis'd him never to love without his Con&s;ent; for that would have been a ridicu|lous Promi&s;e; a Promi&s;e, the Performance of Non-performance of which was not in his own Power, and would depend entirely on what the People call <HI>Chance,</HI> and what Phi|lo&s;ophers call <HI>Providence.</HI> What could he mean then by not declaring him&s;elf? As the Love he had conceiv'd for <HI>Indiana</HI> was no Breach of the Promi&s;e he had made to his Father, &s;o neither could he violate it by any Declaration of that Pa&s;&s;ion! What then, once more, can he mean by his Silence? His only rea&s;onable way of proceeding had been to acquaint not only his Mi&s;tre&s;s, but his Fa|ther, and all the World, with the Pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="24" REF="48">
which he felt for her, and with the Nece&s;&s;ity he was in to marry her, or to be for ever mi&s;erable. Such a Declaration was not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with his Duty; and if his Father had either Rea&s;on or Compa&s;&s;ion, would have caus'd him to relent, and to re|lea&s;e his Son from a Promi&s;e, the per&s;evering in which mu&s;t prove unhappy, or fatal to him. If it &s;hould be &s;aid that &s;uch a Con|cealment of his Pa&s;&s;ion was nece&s;&s;ary, that he might make a Retreat with Honour, in Ca&s;e his Father &s;hould &s;till be ob&s;tinate; to this I an&s;wer, That there was no Retreat for him, unle&s;s he would at the &s;ame time re|treat from Virtue and Honour; that his Be|haviour had fix'd and determined him; that by his Genero&s;ity and con&s;tant Vi&s;its, he had rai&s;ed the Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Indiana</HI> to &s;uch a Height, that his leaving her would in all likelihood be followed by Madne&s;s, or by Self-murder, or by dreadful Hy&s;terical Symp|toms, as deplorable as either; of which, what pa&s;&s;es between her Father and her in the fifth Act, is a &s;ufficient Proof. Be&s;ide, that &s;uch a Retreat would prove as fatal to her Honour as to her Per&s;on: He had for &s;ome time made con&s;tant Vi&s;its; he had made ve|ry extravagant Pre&s;ents to her; he had made no Declaration of the Affection he had for her, either to her or to her Aunt <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> or acquainted any one with his De&s;ign to marry her, if he could obtain his Father's
<PB N="25" REF="49">
Con&s;ent. Now can any thing be more plain, than that &s;uch a Behaviour, if he left her, would ruin the Reputation of the poor Lady, and cau&s;e all the World to entertain &s;uch Thoughts of her as <HI>Sealand</HI> and <HI>Myrtle</HI> had already expre&s;s'd. And thus I have endea|vour'd to &s;hew that the Behaviour of <HI>Bevil</HI> to <HI>Indiana,</HI> in his concealing his Pa&s;&s;ion from her, is as ridiculou&s;ly whim&s;ical, as that of <HI>Cimberton</HI> to her Si&s;ter <HI>Lucinda.</HI></P>
<P>The Cata&s;tophre, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is very moving, but it would be more &s;o, if it were rightly and rea&s;onably handled, becau&s;e it would be much more &s;urprizing. For the Surprize is, in a good Mea&s;ure, prevented by the Behaviour of <HI>I&s;abella</HI> upon the fir&s;t Ap|pearance of <HI>Sealand</HI>; which, if it had not been out of all Probability and Nature, would have prevented it more. It was highly in Nature and Probability, that <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> upon the fir&s;t di&s;covering her Brother, &s;hould fly into an exce&s;&s;ive Tran&s;port of Joy, and have run to embrace him; for when &s;he is made to &s;ay, That her Brother mu&s;t not know her yet, &s;he is made to give no Rea|&s;ons for it, nor can the Audience imagine any. 'Tis not <HI>I&s;abella</HI> who &s;ays that, but the Author, who clum&s;ily u&s;es it to &s;erve a Turn; for if &s;he had di&s;cover'd her&s;elf to her Brother at his fir&s;t Appearance, it had prevented the Audience's Sorrow and Com|pa&s;&s;ion for the imaginary Di&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Indiana,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="50">
and, con&s;equently, their return to Joy. But as <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and all the great Criticks after him, have taught us, that there is to be no Inci|dent in a Dramatick Poem, but what mu&s;t be founded on Rea&s;on, it happens, as we ob&s;erv'd above, very unluckily here, that there is no Incident in the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers</HI> but what is attended by &s;ome great Ab&s;ur|dity. For the Action of <HI>Indiana,</HI> in throw|ing away her Bracelet, is of the &s;ame Stamp, and is entirely the Author's, and not the Dramatick Per&s;on's; for it was neither ne|ce&s;&s;ary nor profitable, that <HI>Indiana,</HI> in the Height of her Agony, &s;hould &s;o much as think of her Bracelet, or if &s;he did think of it, &s;hould re&s;olve to throw away the greate&s;t Token that &s;he had to remember her dead Mother, for who&s;e Memory her Grief and Di&s;tre&s;s ought naturally to renew and re|double her Tenderne&s;s. But the Author is obliged to have Recour&s;e to this as an awkard Expedient, tho' the be&s;t he could find, to bring on the Di&s;covery. But had he known any thing of the Art of the Stage, he would have known, that tho&s;e Di&s;coveries are but dully made, which are made by Tokens; that they ought nece&s;&s;arily or probably to &s;pring from the whole Train of the Incidents contrary to our Expectation. And how ea&s;y was it to bring that about here? For &s;uch a Di&s;covery had been very well prepared, by what young <HI>Bevil</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Humphrey</HI> in the
<PB N="27" REF="51">
fir&s;t Act, and by the Hint <HI>Indiana</HI> gives to <HI>Sealand</HI> in the fifth Act, which Hint the old Gentleman readily takes; for when &s;he tells him &s;he had been made an Infant Captive on the Seas, he immediately crys out, <HI>An Infant Captive!</HI> and, after &s;ome Interruption given by <HI>Indiana,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>Dear Lady! O yet one Moment's Patience, my Heart grows full with your Affliction, but yet there is &s;ome|thing in your Story that</HI>&mdash;She an&s;wers as if &s;he were at cro&s;s Purpo&s;es, <HI>My Portion here is Bitterne&s;s and Sorrow.</HI> To which he replies, <HI>Do not think &s;o. Pray an&s;wer me, Does</HI> Bevil <HI>know your Name and Fami|ly?</HI> So that a few Que&s;tions more, perti|nently an&s;wer'd, would have brought on the Di&s;covery. Now if the Di&s;covery had been made this Way, and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had not known her Brother at her fir&s;t &s;eeing him, but had come in to <HI>Sealand</HI> and <HI>Indiana</HI> ju&s;t after the Di&s;covery had been made, there would have been two Surprizes, both greater and more agreeable than now they are, and both of them without Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>But now the Mention of the Infant Cap|tive brings to my Remembrance the Cir|cum&s;tances of that Captivity, which are, to u&s;e Mr. <HI>Cimberton</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion, pregnant with Ab&s;urdity. <HI>Indiana,</HI> it &s;eems, with her Mother and her Aunt, are taken, in their Pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Indies,</HI> by a Privateer from <HI>Toulon,</HI> and carried into that Place. Now
<PB N="28" REF="52">
where were they taken? It mu&s;t be either in the Channel, or on the Ocean. Now, in the fir&s;t place, I never heard that <HI>Toulon</HI> &s;et out any Privateers. Secondly, Suppo&s;e they did, 'tis improbable that a Privateer from <HI>Toulon</HI> &s;hould cruize in the Ocean, and much more improbable that they &s;hould rove as far as the Channel. Thirdly, 'Tis highly impro|bable, that an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, which had Force enough to venture without a Convoy, &s;hould be taken by a Privateer. Fourthly, 'Tis not a Jot more probable, that &s;uppo&s;ing a Privateer from <HI>Toulon</HI> &s;hould have taken &s;uch a Ve&s;&s;el, it &s;hould chu&s;e to carry it into <HI>Toulon,</HI> rather than into <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> or <HI>St. Malo.</HI> For how long mu&s;t a Privateer be carrying an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ve&s;&s;el from the Channel to <HI>Toulon,</HI> which is above a thou&s;and Miles from the Chan|nel, and little le&s;s di&s;tant from that Part of the Ocean o'er which our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships pa&s;s. Now in &s;o long a Voyage, the Priva|teer might very well be taken, and the Prize be retaken; whereas the latter might be carried to <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> or <HI>St. Malo,</HI> with a hun|dred Times le&s;s Danger.</P>
<P>Well! But let us &s;uppo&s;e the Privateer got &s;afely with his Prize into <HI>Toulon.</HI> Does Sir <HI>Richard</HI> believe, that <HI>Toulon</HI> is &s;ituate under one of the Poles, that neither Ship nor Pa&s;|&s;engers were heard of in &s;o many Years. If <HI>Indiana</HI> was an Infant, <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was old enough to write; and if &s;he was &s;o indiffe|rent
<PB N="29" REF="53">
or &s;tupid as to omit it, the Captain of the Ship and his Mate would not fail to write to their Owners, to let them know the Fate of their Ship. If there was no Pa&s;&s;age for Letters directly thro' <HI>France,</HI> yet the Way of <HI>Holland</HI> was open, and upon the Arrival of tho&s;e Letters, not only the whole <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, but all <HI>London</HI> would have known what was become of the Ship, at a Time when &s;o many News-Writers contend|ed which could furni&s;h the Town with mo&s;t and the fre&s;he&s;t News. So that if <HI>Sealand,</HI> upon his coming from the <HI>Indies,</HI> had made but never &s;o little Enquiry, he would have found that his Si&s;ter and Daughter had been at <HI>Toulon:</HI> If he had made no Enquiry, he mu&s;t have &s;hewn him&s;elf a fine Gentleman, in|deed, who would marry a &s;econd Wife before he was certain the fir&s;t was dead: And it is impo&s;&s;ible he could know that the fir&s;t was dead, without knowing that his Si&s;ter and his Daughter were at <HI>Toulon.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now compare the Relation that old <HI>Bevil</HI> makes to his Man <HI>Humphrey,</HI> in the fir&s;t Scene of the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers,</HI> to that which <HI>Simo</HI> makes to <HI>So&s;ia</HI> in the be|ginning of the <HI>Andria:</HI> But I &s;hall only compare them at pre&s;ent with relation to the Incidents; I &s;hall take an Oportunity afterwards to con&s;ider the Sentiments and Expre&s;&s;ions by them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="54">
The beginning of the <HI>Andria</HI> is perfectly in Nature: <HI>Simo</HI> begins the Relation which he makes to <HI>So&s;ia</HI> with a grave and a &s;o|lemn Air, &s;uitable to the Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind he is in, and the great Concern he is under: Old <HI>Bevil,</HI> who is &s;uppos'd to be in the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind, and to lie under the &s;ame Concern, begins the Rela|tion which he makes to <HI>Humphrey</HI> with an Impertinence dully gay; and therefore the beginning of the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers</HI> is entire|ly out of <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Andria, Chremes,</HI> a rich old <HI>A|thenian</HI> Citizen, offers to be&s;tow his only Daughter <HI>Philumena</HI> with a great Dowry on <HI>Pamphilus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Simo,</HI> who ac|cepts that Offer for his Son. The Match breaks off upon the Di&s;covery which <HI>Pam|philus</HI> makes at the Funeral of <HI>Chry&s;is</HI> of his Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Glycerium. Simo</HI> the Father pretends that it &s;till goes on, that he may take an Opportunity, from his Son's Refu|&s;al, of giving him a &s;evere Reprimand:</P>
<Q><L>Si propter amorem uxorem nolit ducere,</L>
<L>Ea primum ab illo animadvertenda Injuria e&s;t,</L>
<L>Et nunc id operam do, ut per fal&s;as Nuptias</L>
<L>Vera objurgandi Cau&s;a &s;it, &s;i deneget.</L></Q>
<P>In the beginning of the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers</HI> there is a very ab&s;urd Imitation of this Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Terence:</HI> Where old <HI>Bevil</HI> &s;peaks
<PB N="31" REF="55">
thus to his Man <HI>Humphrey,</HI> concerning his Son.</P>
<P><HI>If there is &s;o much in this Amour of his, that he denies upon my Summons to marry, I &s;hall have Cau&s;e enough to be offended: And then by in&s;i&s;ting upon his marrying to Day, I &s;hall know how far he is engag'd to the Lady in Ma&s;querade, and from thence only &s;hall be able to take my Mea&s;ures.</HI></P>
<P>Now it &s;eems plain to me, that <HI>Simo</HI> would have rea&s;on to be angry at his Son's Refu&s;al, and that old <HI>Bevil</HI> would have none. <HI>Pamphilus</HI> would refu&s;e a Wife with a great Dowry, which he wanted, having nothing but what his Father &s;upply'd him with, who, perhaps, might not be very ea&s;y in his own Circum&s;tances. Be&s;ides, <HI>Glyce|rium</HI> pa&s;s'd for a Courtezan, (which was not the Ca&s;e of <HI>Indiana,</HI>) becau&s;e &s;he was believ'd to be the Si&s;ter of <HI>Chry&s;is,</HI> who was publickly known to be one. And it would provoke any Father of a good Family, and who had all along liv'd with Reputation in the World, to find, to the Ruin and Di&s;|grace of that Family, his only Son married to a Whore, or living with her as if he were married to her, which was again&s;t both Law and Cu&s;tom at <HI>Athens,</HI> and a great deal more &s;candalous there, than it is in this Ble&s;&s;ed Town, as is evident from what <HI>Simo</HI> &s;ays in that admirable Scence which is between him and his Son and <HI>Chremes,</HI> in
<PB N="32" REF="56">
the fifth Act of this Comedy, where Nature is drawn with &s;uch ma&s;terly Strokes, and in &s;uch lively and glowing Colours.</P>
<Q><L>Adeo n'impotentie&s;&s;e animo, ut praeter Civium</L>

<P>But 'tis downright ridiculous in old <HI>Bevil</HI> to pretend to be offended, in Ca&s;e his Son who is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great E&s;tate, and entirely independant on his Father, and one whom the Father him&s;elf calls a &s;ober and di&s;creet Gentleman, &s;hould refu&s;e to marry at a Minute's Warning a Woman whom he does not like, and whom the Father chu&s;es only with the &s;ordid View of doubling a great E&s;|tate, when what they had already was more than &s;ufficient: Becau&s;e the Father is &s;ordid, mu&s;t the Son be unhappy? Mu&s;t the Son, who has be&s;poke a Di&s;h for him&s;elf, take up with another that is his Aver&s;ion, only be|cau&s;e his Father choo&s;es it? The Pa&s;&s;ion which young <HI>Bevil</HI> had for another, is a ju&s;t Cau&s;e of his Refu&s;al; and if his Father is unrea&s;onably offended, the Son, who has no Dependance upon him, may very rea&s;onably be comforted. As the Father knew very well that the Son had no Occa&s;ion for the Wealth which would come from the marrying <HI>Lu|cinda,</HI> &s;o he did not believe his frequenting <HI>Indiana,</HI> whether he &s;uppos'd her an hono|rable
<PB N="33" REF="57">
or a kept Mi&s;tre&s;s, would bring any Scandal either upon him&s;elf or his Family. Witne&s;s what he &s;ays to <HI>Sealand</HI> in <HI>Act</HI> 4 <HI>Page</HI> 62 concerning this very Affair, <HI>viz. Sir, I can't help &s;aying, that what might injure a Citizen's Credit may be no Stain to a Gen|tleman's Honour.</HI> So that 'tis plain <HI>Simo</HI> had two important Rea&s;ons to be offended at his Son's Refufal, which old <HI>Bevil</HI> apparent|ly had not; becau&s;e he rejected Wealth, which he wanted; and courted Infamy, for which no one can have an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Relation of what pa&s;&s;ed between young <HI>Bevil</HI> and <HI>Indiana</HI> at the Ma&s;querade, is a very ab&s;urd Imitation of what pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Pamphilus</HI> and <HI>Glycerium</HI> at the Funeral of <HI>Chry&s;is. Pamphilus</HI> attends <HI>Glycerium</HI> to the Funeral of <HI>Chry&s;is,</HI> who pa&s;s'd for her Si&s;ter. While the Body was burning, <HI>Gly|cerium</HI> in the Agony of her Grief, ran to the Fire, and was about to throw her&s;elf into it, when <HI>Pamphilus,</HI> half dead with Fear, runs to her, catches hold of her, throws his Arms about her, and by that Action, and his tender Expo&s;tulation di&s;covers the Vio|lence of that Pa&s;&s;ion which he had hitherto conceal'd; upon which <HI>Glycerium,</HI> by an Action which manife&s;ted her habitual Love, weeping reclin'd her Head upon his Brea&s;t with a mo&s;t moving Tenderne&s;s. This is the Sen&s;e of that celebrated Pa&s;&s;age: But is but
<PB N="34" REF="58">
barely the Sen&s;e; for no Pen, no Tongue can expre&s;s the Elegance and the Grace of <HI>Terence.</HI></P>
<P>But now let us &s;ee the Imitation of this in the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers:</HI> 'Tis in the fir&s;t Scene of the Play, where old <HI>Bevil</HI> relates to his Man <HI>Hump<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ey</HI> what pa&s;&s;ed at the la&s;t Ma&s;|querade.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir J. Bevil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, I was la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> at the Ma&s;querade; my Son, you may remember, &s;oon found us out. He knew his Grandfather's Habit, which I then wore; and tho' it was the Mode, in the la&s;t Age, yet the Maskers, you know, follow'd us as if we had been the mo&s;t mon&s;trous Figures in the whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>

<P>I remember, indeed, a young Man of Quality in the Habit of a Clown, that was particularly trouble &s;ome.</P>

<P>Right: He was too much what he &s;eemed to be.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir J. Bevil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, he followed us, till the Gentleman, who led the Lady in the <HI>Indian</HI> Mantle, pre&s;ented that gay Creature to the Ru&s;tick, and bid him (like <HI>Cymon</HI> in the Fable) grow polite, by falling in Love, and let that worthy old Gentleman alone, meaning me. The Clown was not reform'd, but rudely per&s;i&s;ted, and offer'd to force off my Mask; with that the Gentleman, throw|ing off his own, appear'd to be my Son; and in his Concern for me, tore off that of the No|bleman;
<PB N="35" REF="59">
At this they &s;eiz'd each other: The Company called the Guards, and in the Surpri&s;e the Lady &s;wooned away; upon which my Son quitted his Adver&s;ary, and had now no Care but of the Lady; when rai|&s;ing her in his Arms, art thou gone, cried he, for ever&mdash;Forbid it Heaven!&mdash;She revives at his known Voice,&mdash;and with the mo&s;t familiar, tho' mode&s;t Ge&s;ture, hangs in Safety over his Shoulder, weeping; but wept as in the Arms of one before whom &s;he could give her&s;elf a Loo&s;e, were &s;he not under Ob&s;ervation: while &s;he hides her Face in his Neck, he carefully conveys her from the Company.</P>
</SP>
<P>Now there is this remarkable Difference between what pa&s;s'd at the Funeral, and what pa&s;s'd at the Ma&s;querade, that every Thing that relates to the former, &s;eems to be either nece&s;&s;ary or profitable; and almo&s;t eve|ry Thing that relates to the latter, appears to be improbable. How injudicious an Imitation is the Behaviour of <HI>Indiana</HI> at the Ma&s;que|rade, of the Behaviour of <HI>Glycerium</HI> at the Funeral. Nothing can be more natural than the Freedom which <HI>Glycerium</HI> takes with <HI>Pamphilus.</HI> She lov'd him, and was be|lov'd by him: She was betroth'd to him; She had no Re&s;erve for him: The utmo&s;t Fami|liarities had pa&s;s'd between them: She was with Child by him, and expected every Day
<PB N="36" REF="60">
that the Time of her being deliver'd was come.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of <HI>Indiana</HI> is very different, and her Behaviour is very incon&s;i&s;tent with her Character; 'tis true, &s;he was in Love with young <HI>Bevil,</HI> but doubted very much whe|ther that Love was reciprocal; he had been &s;o far from taking the &s;ame Liberty with her that <HI>Pamphilus</HI> had done with <HI>Glycerium,</HI> that his Behaviour had been always very re|&s;pectful; and yet <HI>Indiana</HI> u&s;es the &s;ame Fa|miliarity upon this Occa&s;ion with him, that <HI>Glycerium</HI> at the Funeral does with <HI>Pamphi|lus</HI>; &s;he revives at his known Voice, which &s;he heard, it &s;eems, after &s;he had lo&s;t all her Sen&s;es, and comes from Death to Life upon it, like the dead Men in the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI> at the Voice of Poet <HI>Bays,</HI> and with the mo&s;t familiar, tho' mode&s;t Ge&s;ture, hangs in Safe|ty over his Shoulder weeping, but wept as in the Arms of one before whom &s;he could give her&s;elf a Loo&s;e, were &s;he not under Ob|&s;ervation; and while &s;he hides her Face in his Neck, he carefully conveys her from the Company.</P>
<P>Now this Behaviour is by no means con|&s;i&s;tent with the Character of <HI>Indiana</HI>; fami|liar and mode&s;t are not in this Ca&s;e very compatible; and then what does Sir <HI>Richard</HI> mean by <HI>wept as in the Arms of one before whom &s;he could give her&s;elf a Loo&s;e?</HI> If the&s;e Words have any Meaning, I would fain know what it is.</P>

<P>Thus have I gone thro' the whole Train of Incidents, which are a Heap of Ab&s;urdi|ties and Incon&s;i&s;tences. I have partly like|wi&s;e gone thro' the Character of young <HI>Be|vil,</HI> who is made up of Contradictions. He is one who differs from him&s;elf as much as from the re&s;t of the World. This Man of Con&s;cience and of Religion is as arrant an Hypocrite as a certain Author. 'Tis indeed a plea&s;ant Religion that never &s;eizes a Man but when he is upon the Point either of Love
<PB N="38" REF="62">
or Battle: This Man of Con&s;cience and of Religion di&s;&s;embles with his Father mo&s;t vilely, which Religion doth by no means allow, and &s;o chu&s;es rather to offend Heaven than an old &s;ordid Blockhead, who pretends to treat one who is independent of him, and at Years of Di&s;cretion, like an arrant Boy; yet this the Son calls an hone&s;t Di&s;&s;imulation, as he calls Breach of Tru&s;t the getting over a fal&s;e Point of Honour. In the fir&s;t Scene of the &s;econd Act this Man of Religion is put|ting <HI>Myrtle</HI> upon a Fraud, and palming two counterfeit Lawyers upon old Mrs. <HI>Sealand,</HI> a Practice which Religion and Morality both abhor.</P>
<P>The Character of young <HI>Bevil</HI> therefore is made up of Qualities, either incoherent and contradictory, as Religion and Di&s;&s;imulation, Morality and Fraud; or mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly con&s;i&s;tent, as Circum&s;pection and Folly. For one may &s;ay the &s;ame thing of young <HI>Bevil</HI> that <HI>Scandal</HI> in <HI>Love for Love</HI> &s;ays of and to <HI>Fore&s;ight, That if ever he commits an Er|ror, 'tis not without a great deal of Con&s;ide|ration, Circum&s;pection and Caution.</HI> The Character therefore of young <HI>Bevil</HI> is not an Image of any thing in Life, and e&s;pecially in common Life, as every thing in Comedy ought to be, but the Phantom of a feveri&s;h Author's Brain, as &s;everal of the other Cha|racters likewi&s;e are.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="63">
As young <HI>Bevil</HI> is the Character of &s;uch a young Man as is not to be found in the World, upon the foot of Nature, of which all true Poetry is a ju&s;t Imitation, <HI>Cimberton</HI> is a Creature who is &s;et as much below Humani|ty as <HI>Bevil</HI> appears to be drawn above it; he is an Animal that is nothing &s;o like a Man as a Monkey is, nor is he near &s;o well qua|lified to entertain a Lady agreeably; he is &s;o very mon&s;trous, that one would not think he could be produced by any thing that had hu|man Shape, and for the Credit of Human Nature ought, like a <HI>Sooterkin,</HI> to be demo|li&s;hed as &s;oon as he appears.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the other Characters are faintly and coar&s;ly drawn, which is very &s;trange, if we con&s;ider the admirable Patterns that <HI>Terence</HI> has laid before him. The Characters of that Comick Poet I mu&s;t confe&s;s are in no great Compa&s;s, but tho' they are few they are excellent; they are &s;o &s;trong in Nature, that they may be taken for the Life, may be taken for Per&s;ons rather than Pictures, and for real rather than dramatick Per&s;ons. Sir <HI>Richard</HI> &s;eems to be wholly ignorant of what <HI>Boileau</HI> has &s;aid of this Matter, who is one of the greate&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Poets, and one of the ju&s;te&s;t of their Criticks.</P>

<P>That is,</P>
<Q>Beware of being plea&s;ant at the Expence of good Sen&s;e, and take care that you never go out of Nature. Ob&s;erve with what an Air a Father in <HI>Terence</HI> reprimands his a|morous Son for his imprudent Conduct, with what Air the Lover hearkens to his grave Remon&s;trances, then runs away to his Mi|&s;tre&s;s to laugh at the&s;e mu&s;ty Morals.

<P>The very Character of <HI>Simo</HI> in the <HI>Andria</HI> is admirable, and the Relation he makes to <HI>So&s;ia</HI> a Ma&s;terpiece; I never read it but I &s;ee the old <HI>Athenian</HI> before my Eyes in the very &s;ame Colours that <HI>Davus</HI> paints <HI>Crito</HI> the <HI>Andrian</HI> in the &s;ame Comedy.</P>

Whatever he &s;ays goes to my Heart; whereas old <HI>Bevil</HI> is an old fribling Block|head, and that which comes from him &s;carce touches my Lips.</P>

<P>The Sentiments of <HI>Terence</HI> are always true, are always ju&s;t, and adapted to the Cha|racters; His Dialogue is the mo&s;t charming that is to be found among the <HI>Roman</HI> Au|thors: Where is there that Purity, that Ele|gance, that Delicacy, that Grace, that Har|mony? If it has any Fault, 'tis too uniform a Politene&s;s; the Servant &s;peaking always with the &s;ame Grace and the &s;ame Elegance that his Ma&s;ter does. Setting that a&s;ide, 'tis every way accompli&s;h'd: It has particularly for its Purity the Authorities of two of the be&s;t and greate&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Judges, <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Cicero. Cicero</HI> &s;ays of this Comick Poet, that he is <HI>optimus Author Latinitatis</HI>; and all the World has &s;een the Ver&s;es that <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> made upon the &s;ame Author.</P>
