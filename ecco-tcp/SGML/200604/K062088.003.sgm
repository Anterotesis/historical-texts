<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>AT the end of a week, Cele&s;tina, with
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone and her children, were
arrived at the &s;mall village of Kirby Thorn,
where, as the younge&s;t of the little boys had
appeared the preceding day to droop, his
mother determined to pa&s;s the night. Ce|le&s;tina,
who &s;aw her friend greatly alarmed
by the indi&s;po&s;ition of the child, endea|voured
to appea&s;e her fears by imputing it
to the fatigue and heat of their journey.
But the terrified mother &s;aw every moment
new grounds for her apprehen&s;ions, and the
next day the child was evidently much
<PB N="2" REF="4">
wor&s;e. Four and twenty hours more pa&s;&s;ed
in painful &s;olicitude, and then Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
knew that it was the mea&s;les;
and became much ea&s;ier, though the elde&s;t
boy had every &s;ymptom of having taken
the &s;ame di&s;order.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphin&s;tone never left her children
a moment; and Cele&s;tina, with the ten|dere&s;t
&s;olicitude, a&s;&s;i&s;ted her. The elder
boy was of a &s;anguine and irritable con&s;ti|tution,
and the eruptive fever ran high;
while the &s;ituation they were in, at a little
inn, where the &s;ervants and children of the
hou&s;e had not had the di&s;temper, was ren|dered
extremely uncomfortable by the fears
of it's other inhabitants&mdash;the murmurs of
the landlady and the reluctance of the &s;er|vants.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, with that cheerful benignity
which was on all occa&s;ions ready for the
&s;ervice of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, now acted for her
friend almo&s;t the part of a &s;ervant; and in
her frequent vi&s;its to the kitchen for what
was wanted in the &s;ick room, &s;he &s;aw three
<PB N="3" REF="5">
&s;ervents, a po&s;tillion and two footmen, and
ob&s;erved that they &s;eemed fixed there, and
were not at pre&s;ent travelling. The men
were remarkably well behaved, and ob|&s;erving
the di&s;content of the people of the
inn, had more than once offered to go out
for her on any me&s;&s;ages &s;he might have oc|ca&s;ion
to &s;end.</P>
<P>The mind of Cele&s;tina was, however, too
much occupied by the little invalids to &s;uf|fer
her curio&s;ity to be awakened by this
circum&s;tance; and &s;he never enquired to
whom the&s;e &s;ervants, nor a very plain but
fa&s;hionable po&s;t chai&s;e, about which &s;he &s;aw
them &s;ometimes bu&s;ied, belonged. The
children were in the height of the di&s;tem|per,
and the anxious mother and Cele&s;tina
entirely occupied about them, when a very
decent per&s;on, about fifty, who had the
look of a hou&s;ekeeper to &s;ome per&s;on of
fa&s;hion, came to the door of their room,
which was left open for the &s;ake of air, and
a&s;king permi&s;&s;ion to come in, told them,
that her lady, Lady Horatia Howard, had
<PB N="4" REF="6">
ordered her to wait on them to enquire if
her &s;ervants or any thing in her power
could contribute to the ea&s;e of the children,
or the ladies to whom they belonged.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphin&s;tone returned a proper an|&s;wer
to this very polite and humane me&s;|&s;age;
and after the per&s;on who had deli|vered
it was withdrawn, Cele&s;tina pau&s;ing
a moment, &s;aid that &s;he recollected the
name of Lady Horatia Howard, and that
&s;he was one of the friends mo&s;t e&s;teemed
among the numerous acquaintance culti|vated
by Mrs. Willoughby.</P>
<P>It was now debated between them whe|ther,
after &s;o obliging a me&s;&s;age, Cele&s;tina
&s;hould not make her&s;elf known to Lady
Horatia: Mrs. Elphin&s;tone was inclined to
think &s;he ought; but Cele&s;tina &s;eemed ra|ther
di&s;po&s;ed to avoid it.&mdash;"It is true,"
&s;aid &s;he, "that I recollect my dear Mrs.
Willoughby to have been very partial to
her, but it is probable that &s;he has long
&s;ince forgotten me, and that I &s;hall be ex|po&s;ed
to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of an|nouncing
<PB N="5" REF="7">
my&s;elf, and recalling to her mind
circum&s;tances&punc; which I cannot remember
but with pain. Perhaps, too, &s;he may
know the &s;trange occurrences which have
&s;ince happened; and though I remember
her conver&s;ation to have been very refined
and elegant, perhaps &s;he may expect, if &s;he
honours me with her notice, that I &s;hould
prove my&s;elf worthy of it, by relating all
that has happened; for who knows in
what light the Ca&s;tlenorth's may have re|pre&s;ented
my conduct. I am unequal to all
this, I fear; and unle&s;s to avail my&s;elf of
our former acquaintance will be of any u&s;e
to you, my dear Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, I &s;hall
not, for my own fake only, endeavour to
renew it."</P>
<P>In a few hours afterwards, however, La|dy
Horatia, who had heard from her &s;er|vant
of the fine form and amiable manners
of the young per&s;on who was &s;o attentive to
the &s;ick children, contrived to have a door
left open by which &s;he mu&s;t pa&s;s; and &s;ee|ing
her, immediately knew her. On her
<PB N="6" REF="8">
return into the room therefore, Lady Ho|ratia
&s;ent her woman again, with her com|pliments,
begging to know if the name of
one of the ladies was not De Mornay, and
if it was, reque&s;ting the favour of &s;peaking
to her.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina could not now decline going;
and following the me&s;&s;enger, was &s;hewn
into a room where Lady Horatia &s;at alone.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, dear Mi&s;s de Mornay,"
cried &s;he, the moment &s;he entered, "if
in&s;tead of waiting on you, I reque&s;t to &s;ee
you here. The truth is, I am fooli&s;hly af|fected
by the &s;ight of illne&s;s. That which
has attacked your little friends is not howe|ver,
I hope, dangerous?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who by the freedom and kind|ne&s;s
of this addre&s;s was immediately re|lieved
from &s;ome little unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;he
had felt from this unexpected interview,
an&s;wered with all her u&s;ual ea&s;e and grace,
and Lady Horatia, who &s;eemed extremely
plea&s;ed with having met her, enquired after
Lady Molyneux, and &s;uch other of their
<PB N="7" REF="9">
former friends, as &s;he thought would renew
no unplea&s;ing recollections: for though &s;he
did not know all that had happened, &s;he
was well aware how cruel a blow the death
of Mrs. Willoughby had been to Cele&s;tina,
and had heard &s;ome confu&s;ed reports that
the marriage of Willoughby and Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman
was interrupted by his prior at|tachment
to his mother's ward; but &s;he
knew not how far Cele&s;tina had been pre|ferred
to the haughty heire&s;s; and though
&s;he had always a partial kindne&s;s to her
when &s;he u&s;ed to meet her at Mrs. Wil|loughby's,
&s;he had lo&s;t fight of her en|tirely
afterwards, and, after &s;ome enqui|ries,
concluded &s;he was gone back to
France.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of her now, at a remote inn
in the North, was as agreeable as it was
unexpected; and though the difference of
their ages &s;eemed to preclude any great de|gree
of intimacy before, for Lady Horatia
was pa&s;&s;ed the middle of life, yet now &s;he
felt her&s;elf &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed to cultivate a
<PB N="8" REF="10">
plea&s;ure thus thrown in her way. Cele&s;tina
could not be in&s;en&s;ible of the honour &s;he
derived from the notice of a per&s;on more
eminent for her goodne&s;s and her talents
than her birth or her fortune, and always
plea&s;ing, &s;he grew infinitely more &s;o where
&s;he de&s;ired to plea&s;e. In a few hours, there|fore,
they became &s;o happy with each
other, that Lady Horatia could not part
with her but with regret; and Cele&s;tina
would have left her with reluctance on any
other occa&s;ion than to attend the children
of her friend, (which, during her ab&s;ence,
Mrs. Hemmings, Lady Horatia's woman,
had done, with an attention that prevented
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone's &s;uffering from the en|gagement
of Cele&s;tina with her lady.)</P>
<P>The children became better and their
mother ea&s;ier. Lady Horatia &s;aw and liked
her, and invited both her and Cele&s;tina to
give her as much of their time as they
could &s;pare from their little convale&s;cents.
In con&s;equence of this invitation they were
now a good deal with her, and Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
<PB N="9" REF="11">
on &s;ome occa&s;ion expre&s;&s;ing how
fortunate &s;he thought her&s;elf that in &s;o re|mote
a place &s;he had the honour of be|coming
known to her, Lady Horatia &s;aid,
&s;miling,&mdash;"And I dare &s;ay you think it
very extraordinary too, my dear Madam;
for unle&s;s you had known me before it
would be difficult to account for my being
here. Did you never remark that unhap|pine&s;s
makes people re&s;tle&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Oh, yes! very often," replied Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>"It has had that effect on me," &s;aid
Lady Horatia; and &s;atiated with every
thing in what is called the world, where I
have pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of my life, I
often leave it and ramble about, carele&s;s
of every thing but change of place; my
old faithful &s;ervants and a few books being
the &s;ole companions of my travels. I have
for the&s;e la&s;t four or five years given up
my hou&s;e in the country, and pa&s;&s;ed all
the &s;ummer in wandering about Switzer|land,
France, and England. This year
<PB N="10" REF="12">
I am going into Scotland, for no other
rea&s;on than becau&s;e I have not been there
before: at this village one of my hor&s;es
fell lame; and as it was indifferent to me
where I was, I agreed to my &s;ervant's re|que&s;t
of &s;taying here a day or two. While
I waited, you arrived here, and I own very
&s;incerely that I became intere&s;ted for the
children and for the ladies, &s;uch as Hem|mings
de&s;cribed them to me. I hope we
&s;hall none, of us be &s;orry for the accidents
that detained us here, when the little boys
are quite well, as I am per&s;uaded they will
be now in a few days. They will have
pa&s;&s;ed happily through a very trouble&s;ome
di&s;temper, and I think you will each of
you have added a friend to your &s;tock:
the advantage, however, will be &s;till more
evidently mine, for I hope to have added
two."</P>
<P>A few days confirmed the good opinion
which Lady Horatia entertained of her
new acquaintance and her acquaintance of
her. If &s;he was particularly attached to
<PB N="11" REF="13">
Cele&s;tina, it was becau&s;e &s;he was young
enough to be her daughter, and becau&s;e
&s;he told her that &s;he could not look at her,
e&s;pecially when &s;he was reading or em|ployed
in any thing that gave a &s;erious ca&s;t
to her features, without remarking her
likene&s;s to a per&s;on &s;he had once fondly
loved.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who&s;e thoughts were perpetu|ally
fixed on the &s;trange my&s;tery which
hung over her birth, and who caught at
every thing likely to clear it up, blu&s;hed
deeply the fir&s;t time &s;he made this remark,
and a&s;ked whether this per&s;on was a fo|reigner?</P>
<P>Lady Horatia &s;ighed in her turn, and
&s;aid, no! it was a brother of hers, who
had not been long dead. "He was a
&s;oldier," &s;aid &s;he, "and lo&s;t his life in
America, in that war which tore it from the
Briti&s;h empire. Judge your&s;elf of the like|ne&s;s,
though I well know it mu&s;t be acci|dental."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
She then took out of a travelling trunk a
little filligreed ca&s;ket, in which were &s;e|veral
valuable trinkets and &s;everal pictures.
Three were the portraits of gentlemen.&mdash;"Come,"
&s;aid Lady Horatia, "to prove
whether this re&s;emblance is merely a chi|mera
of mine, let us a&s;k Mrs. Elphin&s;tone
if among the&s;e pictures &s;he &s;ees one which
is like any body &s;he knows; for my dear
Mi&s;s de Mornay, do you know this &s;imi|litude
of countenance &s;truck me when you
were a child with Mrs. Willoughby; and
now that your features are more formed, it
is, in my mind, wonderfully &s;trong. But,
my &s;weet friend, why do you appear &s;o
unea&s;y?"</P>
<P>"I cannot very well tell," replied Ce|le&s;tina,
trying to force a &s;mile: "I am &s;ure
to bear a re&s;emblance to any body dear to
your Lady&s;hip mu&s;t be ever plea&s;ing to
me, though I well know that it mu&s;t be,
as you ob&s;erve, quite accidental."</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphin&s;tone then coming in, Lady
Horatia &s;hewed her the three portraits:&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="15">
"Come tell us, Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, if you
know any living friend whom either of the&s;e
portraits re&s;embles?"</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphin&s;tone took them, and looked
&s;teadily a moment on each; then fixing on
one, &s;he looked more intently, fir&s;t on
that and then on Cele&s;tina. "Indeed I
think I do," cried &s;he: "I &s;urely &s;ee a
re&s;emblance&mdash;a very &s;trong re&s;emblance,
between this picture and Mi&s;s de Mornay.
Ble&s;s me, how very like! the &s;hape of the
face, the mouth, the dark-brown eyebrow,
the colour of the eyes, the &s;etting on of the
hair round the forehead and temples; ex|cept
that it is le&s;s fair, that the features are
proportionably larger, and that you wear
a cap, in truth, my dear friend, it might
have been drawn for you."</P>
<P>"And yet," &s;aid Lady Horatia, &s;mil|ing
mournfully, "this was drawn for a
brother of mine, who could, I fear, be no
relation to our lovely friend here: &s;o
&s;trangely it happens that features coincide."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">
"It is fortunate, very fortunate for me,
Madam," &s;aid Cele&s;tina gravely, "if this
re&s;emblance has had the effect of prejudic|ing
your Lady&s;hip in my favour."</P>
<P>"You have merit enough to ju&s;tify it,
though I had conceived an affection for
you without any introduction. But we will
talk no more of re&s;emblances, if &s;uch di&s;|cour&s;e
makes us melancholy."</P>
<P>Lady Horatia then turned the conver&s;a|tion;
and the next day, as the two little
boys were by this time well enough to con|tinue
their journey, they moved on about
twenty miles together; Lady Horatia beg|ging
for that day to have Cele&s;tina with
her, while her woman went with Mrs. El|phin&s;tone,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the care of her chil|dren.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who knew only in general
that Lady Horatia was a widow of very
affluent fortune, who gave up much of
her time to literary pur&s;uits and literary con|nections,
and much of her fortune to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the unhappy, now learned
<PB N="15" REF="17">
that dome&s;tic misfortunes had contributed,
with her natural turn of mind, to e&s;trange
her entirely from tho&s;e &s;cenes where Cele&s;|tina
had &s;ometimes formerly &s;een her; and
that having lo&s;t an only daughter, (the la&s;t
of her children,) of a deep decline, &s;he now
tried to call off her mind from the &s;ubjects
of her mournful contemplations by change
of place, and had never, &s;ince that period,
re&s;ided long at any of her own hou&s;es, but
had pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t the whole year in tra|velling;
&s;topping wherever &s;he found a
plea&s;ant &s;pot, and often remaining &s;everal
days, or even weeks, at &s;ome remote hou&s;e.
She had once or twice, &s;he &s;aid, engaged
friends to go with her on the&s;e expeditions,
but had always found the difficulties they
made &s;o much counterbalance the plea&s;ure
they were capable of affording her, that
&s;he now travelled alone. "Some," &s;aid
&s;he, "were tired, and &s;ome were ta&s;tele&s;s;
&s;ome were talkative and &s;ome were in&s;ipid.
You will certainly think me fa&s;tidious;
and perhaps I am &s;o; but indeed it is
<PB N="16" REF="18">
more difficult to find &s;uch a companion as
&s;uits me in every re&s;pect, than appears at
fir&s;t view. Women of my own age, who
are e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world, cannot of
cour&s;e leave their families and connections;
tho&s;e who are not, are for the mo&s;t part
unhappy from pecuniary or family di&s;tre&s;&s;es,
and the mind, depre&s;&s;ed at that period of
life, has lo&s;t it's power of re&s;i&s;tance, and
&s;inks in that hopele&s;s languor from which
I often want to be my&s;elf relieved by cheer|ful
conver&s;ation. The young do not tra|vel
for pro&s;pects, or enjoy cataracts and
mountains: they are looking out for lo|vers;
and are wearied when there are nei|ther
men to talk to or adventures to be
hoped for. I have tried two or three young
ladies; and found, that as we had no ideas
in common, our conver&s;ation was &s;oon ex|hau&s;ted;
and when I  was near any place
of &s;ummer re&s;ort, or pa&s;&s;ed through a town
at the time of a race or a mu&s;ic meeting,
their hearts were beating to enter into &s;cenes
which I was only &s;olicitous to fly from.
<PB N="17" REF="19">
Do you know, however, that if I had not
met you ab&s;olutely engaged on this Scotti&s;h
journey, I &s;hould have been &s;trongly
tempted to enquire whether you would al|low
me to make the experiment once more,
where I am &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with an idea
that I &s;hould meet with better &s;ucce&s;s."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina an&s;wered, that her good opi|nion
did her the utmo&s;t honour: and by
degrees the tender and maternal &s;olicitude
Lady Horatia expre&s;&s;ed for her, drew from
her the little narrative of her life. Lady
Horatia expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t aver&s;ion to
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth. "It is true," &s;aid &s;he,
"I do hot know her much from my own
ob&s;ervation; for &s;he is a woman who&s;e,
conver&s;ation I have always di&s;liked and
avoided; but from &s;ome anecdotes of her
that have been related to me by tho&s;e who
know her well, I believe it may with truth
be &s;aid of her, as was &s;aid of a celebrated
political character, that &s;he has "a heart
to imagine, a head to contrive, and a hand
to execute any mi&s;chief." Willoughby
<PB N="18" REF="20">
is young, open-hearted, and artle&s;s: by no
means likely to &s;u&s;pect, or likely to detect
artifice &s;o deep as what &s;he is capable of;
and I am well convinced that there are no
contrivances at which &s;he would he&s;itate,
either to carry a favourite point or avenge
it's failure."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina was extremely comforted by
this opinion given by &s;o good a judge.
Every other &s;orrow was comparatively light
to that which &s;he felt from the idea, when|ever
it forced it&s;elf upon her mind, that
Willoughby had, through ambition, or ca|price,
or avarice, voluntarily de&s;erted her;
and every opinion that &s;trengthened her
own hopes of his unaltered affection, and
imputed his leaving her to the evil machi|nations
of the Ca&s;tlenorths, was &s;oothing
and con&s;olatory.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia Howard was now travel|ling
towards Edinburgh, and made the
time of Mrs. Elphin&s;tone her own, for
the plea&s;ure &s;he derived from her company,
and &s;till more from that of Cele&s;tina, to
<PB N="19" REF="21">
whom, during this journey, &s;he became &s;o
much attached, that &s;he made her promi&s;e
to come to her whenever the abode &s;he was
now going to &s;hould be inconvenient, or
whenever &s;he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of
changing it. An invitation &s;o flattering
was gratefully accepted; and Lady Ho|ratia
having &s;hewn both her travelling
friends every polite and generous attention,
took leave of them with regret on their
leaving Edinburgh with Elphin&s;tone, who
was there waiting for them. She gave Ce|le&s;tina
directions whither to write to her for
the remainder of the &s;ummer, and again
made her promi&s;e to come to her in the
winter, if &s;he left her Scotti&s;h friends; and
at all events to contrive to pa&s;s with her
two or three months of the next &s;ummer.
After taking leave of her, a very tedious
and very dreary journey of many days
brought the Elphin&s;tone's and Cele&s;tina to
the &s;ea &s;ide, where they were to embark for
the I&s;le of Skie. Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, ac|cu&s;tomed
to &s;ee &s;o many different countries,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
was yet &s;truck with di&s;may at the &s;ight of
the black and dreary heaths over which
they travelled; and in &s;pite of all her at|tempts
to &s;u&s;tain her courage, &s;he looked
at her children with eyes where maternal
angui&s;h was too vi&s;ibly expre&s;&s;ed. Elphin|&s;tone,
however, to whom novelty had al|ways
charms, was not yet weary of his &s;i|tuation,
and he was as gay and unconcerned
as if he had been leading his wife to the
mo&s;t beautiful e&s;tate in England. Cele&s;tina,
though very little delighted with the coun|try
they had pa&s;&s;ed through, was deter|mined
to te&s;tify no di&s;like to it that might
add to the painful dejection of her friend,
and by making light of the inconveniencies
of the journey, and putting their hopes and
pro&s;pects in the faire&s;t light, &s;he &s;upported
her drooping &s;pirits, which the thoughtle&s;s
and &s;omewhat unfeeling vivacity of El|phin&s;tone
him&s;elf, &s;erved rather to depre&s;s
than to &s;upport.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>ARRIVED at their in&s;ular abode after
great fatigue, Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, recalling
all her fortitude, bu&s;ied her&s;elf in making
it as comfortable as &s;he could; and a&s;&s;umed,
at lea&s;t, the appearance of cheerfulne&s;s,
though Cele&s;tina &s;aw with concern that it
was often <HI>but</HI> appearance. Cele&s;tina her|&s;elf,
however, who&s;e mind had too long
been unplea&s;ingly called off from that ob|ject
on which &s;he be&s;t loved to fix it, was
far from being di&s;plea&s;ed by the perfect
&s;eclu&s;ion of the place. She could now
wander whole days alone, amid the wild
&s;olitude in which &s;he found her&s;elf, li&s;ten|ing
only to the ru&s;h of the cataract, which,
da&s;hing through broken &s;tones, &s;parkled
amid the dark heath on either &s;ide of it;
<PB N="22" REF="24">
or the &s;ullen waves of the ocean it&s;elf,
which on all &s;ides, &s;urrounded her. The
ptarmigan,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A bird of the grous kind, common in the high|lands of Scotland.</NOTE> bur&s;ting from it's heathy co|vert,
or the &s;ea fowl &s;creeming from the
rocks, were the only &s;ounds that broke
the&s;e murmurs; but &s;he found her &s;pirits
&s;oothed by the wildne&s;s of the places &s;he
vi&s;ited; and far from regretting the more
cultivated &s;cenes &s;he had left, &s;he rejoiced
that &s;ince &s;he no longer could hope to &s;ee
Willoughby, &s;he was relea&s;ed from the
nece&s;&s;ity of attending to any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>The immen&s;e di&s;tance that was now be|tween
them, &s;he &s;ometimes con&s;idered with
di&s;may; but at others &s;he remembered&mdash;
<Q>That di&s;tance only, cannot change the heart.</Q></P>
<P>She tru&s;ted on the long tried, the long
a&s;&s;ured tenderne&s;s of her lover, and was
willing to indulge the &s;oothing hope that
they &s;hould meet again to be &s;eparated no
more, and that he was labouring to remove
<PB N="23" REF="25">
the fatal ob&s;tacle, whatever it was, that
now divided them.</P>
<P>After having been above five weeks on
the i&s;land, a large pacquet arrived from
Cathcart. It enclo&s;ed, among many to
his &s;i&s;ter, one to Cele&s;tina from Willough|by;
and this, more than any &s;he had yet
received from him &s;ince his ab&s;ence, &s;eemed
to a&s;&s;ure her of his unfailing attachment.
It was le&s;s confu&s;ed than tho&s;e he had for|merly
written, and &s;eemed the production
of a mind more ma&s;ter of it&s;elf: and,
though it did not &s;peak in po&s;itive terms
of his immediate return, Cele&s;tina fancied
that many of the expre&s;&s;ions alluded to
that hour; and her heart found this idea
&s;o deliciou&s;ly &s;oothing, that &s;he would not
&s;uffer her rea&s;on to deprive her of any part
of the plea&s;ure &s;he found in indulging it.</P>
<P>A few of the re&s;idents of this and the
neighbouring i&s;lands were by this time ac|quainted
at the hou&s;e of Mr. Elphin&s;tone.
The young, (and of young people their
vi&s;itors principally con&s;i&s;ted,) were all
<PB N="24" REF="26">
charmed with Cele&s;tina, who, whatever
was her inclination for &s;olitude, never re|fu&s;ed
to make one in the ramble of the
morning, or to join the cheerful dance of
an evening. Elphin&s;tone, naturally good
humoured, and particularly de&s;irous of
plea&s;ing her, &s;oon became anxious to pro|mote
the&s;e parties, which Cele&s;tina, who&s;e
heart was opened to new &s;en&s;ations of plea|&s;ure
&s;ince the receipt of Willoughby's la&s;t
letter, did not decline; not only becau&s;e
&s;he found much in the&s;e remote regions to
gratify her curio&s;ity, but becau&s;e &s;he fore&s;aw
that, from the &s;hortne&s;s.of the &s;ummer &s;o
far North, the days when the&s;e amu&s;ements
were practicable were drawing to their con|clu&s;ion,
and that &s;he &s;oon &s;hould be left
unmole&s;ted, to li&s;ten to the roaring of the
waters, and the &s;ighings of the wind round
the naked rocks, again&s;t which it ince&s;|&s;antly
beat.</P>
<P>It was now the end of July, and Cele&s;|tina
had already vi&s;ited Jona and &s;everal
other i&s;lands. Sometimes the&s;e excur&s;ions
<PB N="25" REF="27">
had been made with Mrs. Elphin&s;tone,
but oftener without her. Elphin&s;tone kept
a boat, which was always ready for the
&s;ervice of Cele&s;tina, and when his wife
could not go with her, a Mi&s;s Macqueen,
a very agreeable young highland lady, al|ways
made the third.</P>
<P>Several little i&s;les, which afford no habi|tations
for winter, are &s;cattered among the
larger i&s;lands, which are called the Hebri|des.
One of the&s;e lay within &s;ight of El|phin&s;tone's
hou&s;e, (which was clo&s;e to the
&s;hore,) at the di&s;tance of about a mile and
a half. It was remarkable for the grote&s;que
form of the cliffs which aro&s;e round it, and
for a &s;tream of the pure&s;t water, that bub|bled
up at the highe&s;t ground, and fell
into the &s;ea through a cha&s;m of the rock.
Cele&s;tina, to whom Elphin&s;tone had &s;hewn
it, laughingly called it her i&s;land; and he,
in return, had &s;aid that were &s;he e&s;tabli&s;hed
on it, it would become more dangerous
than the i&s;land of Calyp&s;o. Among other
little plans of amu&s;ement, which the decline
<PB N="26" REF="28">
of &s;ummer in&s;en&s;ibly rendered more fre|quent,
it was agreed that on the fir&s;t fine
day &s;ome cold provi&s;ions &s;hould be taken,
and that they would all dine together on
one of the natural &s;tone tables in Cele&s;tina's
i&s;land.</P>
<P>A fine day was found; the party, which
were Mr. and Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, Mi&s;s
Macqueen, and two gentlemen, were
ready, when one of the boatmen who u&s;u|ally
accompanied them was no where to
be found. Elphin&s;tone, equally impatient
and eager, whatever was the importance or
in&s;ignificance of the matter he was engaged
in, was going him&s;elf in &s;earch of the mi&s;s|ing
man, when one of tho&s;e who remained
in the boat followed and told him that
there was a young man a few yards farther
on the &s;hore, who would take the place of
him that was ab&s;ent, and that it was better
not to wait: Elphin&s;tone, &s;atisfied &s;o long
as his party was not interrupted, accepted
the offer, and the boatman beckoning to a
highlander who &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance, he
<PB N="27" REF="29">
ran towards them and was admitted into
the boat.</P>
<P>The party now put off from &s;hore. The
water was beautifully &s;mooth, the &s;ky
clear, and the wind in their favour; very
little exertion therefore on the part of the
men who were entru&s;ted with the naviga|tion,
landed them &s;afely on the ilk. It
did not contain more than three acres of
land, and the &s;ole inhabitant of it was a
&s;olitary herd&s;man, who&s;e temporary dwel|ling,
compo&s;ed of loo&s;e &s;tones, turf, and
heath, he had rai&s;ed under the protection
of a large cliff of grey &s;late, that &s;eemed
to have &s;tarted away, in &s;ome &s;trange con|cu&s;&s;ion
of nature, from &s;ome other i&s;land,
and to have fixed it&s;elf as a &s;ea mark
amid&s;t the perpendicular and abrupt rocks
that fenced this on every &s;ide. The &s;pring
bur&s;t out near it's ba&s;e, and here the party
&s;at down to make their gay repa&s;t.</P>
<P>When it was over, the gentlemen went
away; and while the boatmen were at
dinner, pu&s;hed out the boat them&s;elves
<PB N="28" REF="30">
and began to fi&s;h near the &s;hore, while
Cele&s;tina, leaving the ladies together,
walked away alone to the we&s;tern coa&s;t of
the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The &s;un was already declining in an
almo&s;t cloudle&s;s &s;ky, and gave the warm|e&s;t
&s;plendour to the broad expan&s;e of
ocean, broken by &s;everal i&s;lands, who&s;e
rocky points and angular cliffs caught the
&s;trong lights, in brilliant contra&s;t to the
lucid hue of the heath with which their
&s;ummits were cloathed, and which on the
northern and ea&s;tern &s;ides threw a dark
&s;hadow on the clear and tranquil bo&s;om
of the &s;ea. The &s;ea birds, in &s;warming
myriads, were returning to their ne&s;ts
among the ragged precipices beneath her;
and Cele&s;tina, recalling to her mind the
"green delights" of Alve&s;tone,
<Q>It's deepening woods, gay lawns, and airy &s;ummits,</Q>
compared it, in pen&s;ive contemplation,
with the &s;cene before her; yet different as
they were, &s;he thought that with Wil|loughby
<PB N="29" REF="31">
any place would be to her a para|di&s;e;
and that even in &s;uch a remote &s;pot
as this &s;he &s;hould be happy if it gave only
a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with him.</P>
<P>This train of thought a little indulged,
made her have recour&s;e to her pencil, and
produced an addre&s;s to him in the follow|ing</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>SONNET.</HEAD>

</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">
The broad orb of the &s;un was now only
half &s;een above the horizon; and Cele&s;tina,
who had little marked the progre&s;s of
time, ro&s;e, and ha&s;tened to join her com|panions;
as &s;he turned for this purpo&s;e
towards that part of the i&s;land where &s;he
had left them, &s;he &s;aw the highlander,
who had been taken by chance into the
boat in con&s;equence of the ab&s;ence of ano|ther,
&s;tart up from the ground at about
two hundred paces from her, where he
&s;eemed to have been concealed behind a
cairn or pile of rude &s;tones, and hurry
away towards the part of the &s;hore where
the boat had been left. The incident
however made no great impre&s;&s;ion on her
mind, but from the &s;ingular appearance
of the man, who was in a complete high|land
dre&s;s, which is now not often &s;een,
and which made him, as he walked very
quickly on before her, &s;eem exactly the
figure a painter would have cho&s;en to have
placed in a land&s;cape, repre&s;enting the
<PB N="31" REF="33">
heathy &s;ummits and romantic rocks of the
Hebrides.</P>
<P>She &s;oon rejoined Mrs. Elphin&s;tone and
Mi&s;s Macqueen. The three gentlemen
almo&s;t as &s;oon approached to tell them it
was time to return; and they arrived again
at their home after a little excur&s;ion with
which all &s;eemed plea&s;ed, though Cele&s;|tina
had &s;uffered &s;ome raillery for having
&s;o long de&s;erted them.</P>
<P>Every day now pa&s;&s;ed nearly alike, di|ver&s;ified
only now and then by the com|pany
of a &s;tranger from &s;ome of the other
i&s;lands, and &s;ometimes a party in the boat.
Elphin&s;tone was not yet tired by the pro|ject
which brought him hither, for to u&s;e
an expre&s;&s;ion of his wife's, which &s;he ut|tered
with a melancholy &s;mile to Cele&s;tina,
"the new was not yet off." He was there|fore
gay and alert; per&s;uaded him&s;elf, by
calculations, which he made after his own
&s;anguine manner, that he was not only a
benefactor to the public, but &s;hould in a
few years realize a great fortune by facili|tating
<PB N="32" REF="34">
the capture of herrings among the
we&s;tern i&s;lands of Scotland.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for the proof of his exploits
in this way was now rapidly approaching,
and he became every day more bu&s;y: but
his wife looked forward to it with le&s;s
plea&s;ure: &s;he langui&s;hed for her little
girls, who were at the other extremity of
England, and thought with di&s;may of the
tempe&s;ts of winter, which would &s;hut her
out from the little communication &s;he yet
had with that country. But whatever was
her regret, &s;he &s;uffered it not to di&s;turb
the tran&s;ient happine&s;s her hu&s;band &s;eemed
to enjoy, nor to communicate any gloom
to the milder cheerfulne&s;s of Cele&s;tina,
who&s;e company was her greate&s;t re&s;ource
again&s;t that cold de&s;pondence, which, in
de&s;pite of all her fortitude, &s;ometimes
&s;eized on her heart.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina had now been almo&s;t three
months an inhabitant of the I&s;le of Skie,
and felt nothing unplea&s;ant in her in&s;u|lar
&s;ituation but the length of time that
<PB N="33" REF="35">
mu&s;t always elap&s;e before &s;he could hear
from Willoughby or even from Cathcart.
A &s;econd packet was however brought to
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone from the latter before the
expiration of the eleventh week of their
abode. With eager impatience it was
opened. Cele&s;tina received her part of it
with a beating heart; but on un&s;ealing it
found no letter from Willoughby. A
letter, in a hand which &s;he did not at the
moment recollect ever to have &s;een be|fore,
attracted her attention and mingled
it with &s;omething of terror. She looked
eagerly at the name, and &s;aw it &s;igned
with that of the elder Mr. Thorold. Her
&s;pirits &s;unk! was it &s;ome ill news of Wil|loughby,
which he communicated that he
might &s;often the blow? She hurried it
over in &s;uch breathle&s;s agitation as hardly
gave her leave to under&s;tand what &s;he read,
which was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Your old friend, amiable Cele&s;tina,
though he has only had one letter from
<PB N="34" REF="36">
you &s;ince you left him, reminds you
of him&s;elf once more, and is &s;orry that,
like every thing in this world, his letter
will convey to you a mixture of plea&s;ure
and pain.</P>
<P>My daughter Arabella is married, to
her own wi&s;hes and tho&s;e of her mo|ther.
In point of fortune &s;he has done
well. We cannot here obtain every
thing. I hope &s;he will be happy, and
am &s;ure &s;he will be rich, which, in the
opinion of mo&s;t fathers, you know, puts
the former point out of doubt. You
will gue&s;s that Mr. Betten&s;on is the
gentleman who is now numbered with
my family. My wife has been gone
with the new married couple &s;ome
weeks to the &s;eat of Mr. Betten&s;on's fa|ther
in Norfolk.</P>
<P>You know I love home; and I love
that tho&s;e who are le&s;s delighted with
it &s;hould not be needle&s;sly di&s;turbed
when they are out; for which rea&s;on I
have never communicated to his mo|ther,
<PB N="35" REF="37">
that Montague, after attending
his &s;i&s;ter's wedding here, did not return
to Oxford as he talked of doing; that
I know not whither he is gone, and
have only had one letter from him &s;ince,
in which he a&s;&s;ures me he is well, and
de&s;ires I would not be unea&s;y about him.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to be otherwi&s;e.
This eccentric young man makes me
tremble for him perpetually. Having
no clue to direct my gue&s;&s;es, I have no
conjecture where or with whom he is;
and think it better to &s;ay as little as I
can about an ab&s;ence on which a thou|&s;and
unfavourable con&s;tructions may be
put. Ah! my lovely ward, how fortu|nate
it would have been, if, when his
judgment directed his heart, it could
have been accepted where&mdash;but this is
wrong, or at be&s;t u&s;ele&s;s. Farewel!

you not to forget</P>

<P><PB N="36" REF="38">
Relieved from her fir&s;t apprehen&s;ions,
Cele&s;tina felt extremely concerned at the
ab&s;ence of Montague Thorold; &s;o painful
to his father, perhaps &s;o di&s;creditable to
him&s;elf. She read over the letter again,
and fancied it very evident that Mr. Tho|rold
imputed it to &s;ome new attachment;
and giving a &s;igh to the recollection of all
it mu&s;t co&s;t &s;uch a father to &s;ee &s;uch an
unfortunate turn of mind bla&s;t all the ac|quirements
of learning, and all the advan|tages
of genius, &s;he turned her thoughts
to Willoughby, and felt with renewed
poignancy the di&s;appointment of not hav|ing
heard from him.</P>
<P>Another and another week pa&s;&s;ed with|out
any intelligence, and all the &s;oothing
hopes Cele&s;tina had &s;o fondly encouraged
gradually gave way to fear and apprehen|&s;ion.
At length a &s;econd packet arrived:
it contained a letter indeed from Wil|loughby;
but &s;o far was it from confirm|ing
the favourable pre&s;ages of the former,
that &s;he &s;aw in it only a prelude to the
<PB N="37" REF="39">
event which other information made her
believe would &s;oon happen&mdash;the marriage
of Willoughby and Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman.
Lady Horatia Howard, who&s;e-attachment
to Cele&s;tina had taken very deep root,
had written to her from London, whither
&s;he was now gone, and had told her, with
as much tenderne&s;s as &s;he could, that &s;uch
was the general report among the relations
of the family, and what was generally be
lieved in the world. From the &s;ame
channel &s;he al&s;o learned that Sir Philip
and Lady Molyneux were expected in
England early in the en&s;uing winter, and
that a large hou&s;e in Portman-&s;quare was
fitting up in the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;tile for their
reception.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia concluded a mo&s;t friendly
letter to Cele&s;tina thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>But my dear Mi&s;s De Mornay, how|ever
all the&s;e things may be, let me
hope that you will not hide your&s;elf in
the Hebrides all the winter: why &s;hould
you? Talents and virtues like your's
<PB N="38" REF="40">
were never intended for ob&s;curity.
Come then to me, and a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf
of the true&s;t welcome. You need not
apprehend meeting Mr. Willoughby
and his bride, for it is under&s;tood that
they are to remain &s;ome time abroad;
and before they return to England,
you will have learned to conquer tho&s;e
painful emotions which the &s;ight of
them now perhaps might give you.
<HI>Your</HI> under&s;tanding &s;ets you above the
puerile indulgence which inferior minds
claim by pre&s;cription towards a fir&s;t
love. The man whom any common
con&s;ideration could induce, after hav|ing
won your affections, to de&s;ert you,
never could de&s;erve you; and if &s;ome
in&s;urmountable barrier is between you,
you will learn to con&s;ider him as a
friend, and con&s;ult his peace in regain|ing
that cheerfulne&s;s which he meant
not to de&s;troy; but which to &s;ee de|&s;troyed,
mu&s;t overcloud his days, how|ever
pro&s;perous they may otherwi&s;e be.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">
There was in this letter more meant
than was expre&s;&s;ed; and on con&s;idering
it, the wonder and unea&s;ine&s;s of Cele&s;tina
were redoubled. But however obliged &s;he
thought her&s;elf by the friendly intere&s;t
Lady Horatia took in her happine&s;s, and
however ju&s;t her arguments might be, &s;he
felt no inclination to quit her pre&s;ent &s;oli|tude;
and &s;ince &s;he had now le&s;s hope
than ever of meeting Willoughby, &s;he
had le&s;s than ever a de&s;ire to return into
the world, but gave her&s;elf up to that
melancholy de&s;pondence, again&s;t which
hope, and her own &s;anguine and cheerful
temper, had till now &s;upported her.</P>
<P>To indulge this encrea&s;ing &s;adne&s;s, it
was now her cu&s;tom to walk out alone af|ter
dinner, and to make for her&s;elf a &s;pe|cies
of gloomy enjoyment from the dreary
and wild &s;cenes around her. A little time
before, &s;he had been imagining how plea|&s;ant
the mo&s;t de&s;olate of the&s;e barren i&s;lands
might be rendered to her by the pre&s;ence
of her beloved Willoughby. She now ra|ther
<PB N="40" REF="42">
&s;ought images of horror. The &s;un,
far di&s;tant from this northern region, was
as faint and languid as the &s;ick thoughts
of Cele&s;tina: his feeble rays no longer
gave any warm colouring to the rugged
cliffs that ro&s;e above her head, or lent the
undulating &s;ea that &s;parkling brilliance
which a few weeks before had given gaiety
and cheerfulne&s;s even to the&s;e &s;cattered
ma&s;&s;es of almo&s;t naked &s;tone, again&s;t which
the water ince&s;&s;antly broke. Grey, &s;ullen,
and cold, the waves now &s;lowly rolled to|wards
the &s;hore, where Cele&s;tina fre|quently
&s;at whole hours, as if to count
them, when &s;he had in reality no idea pre|&s;ent
to her but Willoughby lo&s;t to her for
ever&mdash;Willoughby forgetting her, and mar|ried
to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman!</P>
<P>She had more than once remarked, in
returning from her walks, that a man,
who kept always at &s;uch a di&s;tance that
&s;he could merely di&s;cover to be a high|lander,
&s;eemed to be ob&s;erving her; yet
as he never came near her, and always
<PB N="41" REF="43">
di&s;appeared before &s;he got near the hou&s;e,
&s;he could not imagine him to be one of
the people belonging to Elphin&s;tone: but
puzzled rather than alarmed by his ap|pearance,
for which &s;he could not account,
&s;he in&s;en&s;ibly cea&s;ed to notice him. Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone, occupied as &s;he was by her
own dome&s;tic unea&s;ine&s;s, was &s;till mo&s;t
tenderly attentive to Cele&s;tina, and endea|voured
to communicate to her &s;ome of that
&s;till and mournful acquie&s;cence which
&s;erved her in place of philo&s;ophy. Ce|le&s;tina
had not yet &s;uffered enough to learn
it; but &s;he forbore to add to the melan|choly
of her friend by indulging her own
while they were together; and this re|&s;traint
threw her more than ever into entire
&s;olitude, though the autumn was &s;o far ad|vanced
that the weather frequently drove
her from the open hill, or the vale under
it, to the ca&s;ual &s;helter of &s;ome natural
cave, by the &s;ide of which, the torrent, en|crea&s;ed
by the &s;torm, hoar&s;ely ru&s;hed, and
was an&s;wered by the roar of other &s;treams,
<PB N="42" REF="44">
who&s;e hollow murmurs &s;welled in the gu&s;ts
of wind that whi&s;tled through the moun|tainous
tracks, and compelled even the
fowls of the de&s;art to &s;eek &s;helter, where
only it was afforded, within the caverns
of the cliffs, or among the matted heath
that cloathed their &s;ummits.</P>
<P>The delicate, the elegant, the lovely
Cele&s;tina, &s;he who&s;e talents would have

reclu&s;e in the remote&s;t and mo&s;t
uncultivated part of the Briti&s;h dominions.
Her wi&s;h now was, to pa&s;s her whole life
here, in that &s;ullen calm which &s;he at length
hoped to obtain; and the rude&s;t &s;cene of
the&s;e i&s;lands now appeared to her infinitely
preferable to any of the plea&s;ures Lady
Horatia Howard offered her, &s;ince <HI>they</HI>
could only &s;erve to remind her of Wil|loughby;
perhaps to &s;hew her how happy
he could learn to be, united with another.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">
The frequency of &s;torms now prevented
many of tho&s;e vi&s;its which had, during
&s;ummer, a little broken, for Elphin&s;tone,
the uniformity of &s;olitude; but it was the
height of the &s;ea&s;on for catching herrings,
and he was bu&s;y, and for the pre&s;ent hap|py;
while his unfortunate wife, who, de|&s;olate
as her pre&s;ent &s;ituation was, yet
dreaded the hour when this bu&s;tle &s;hould
&s;ink into di&s;content and give place to other
projects, received him on his return from
tho&s;e expeditions to other i&s;lands, in which
he was now frequently engaged, always
with cheerfulne&s;s, which he did not, or
would not &s;ee, was forced; and &s;ometimes
with &s;miles, which to every body but him
very evidently were the &s;miles of &s;tifled an|gui&s;h.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina an&s;wered Lady Horatia's letter
as it de&s;erved, but to Willoughby &s;he de|termined
not to write. That trembling
&s;olicitude with which &s;he had been accu&s;|tomed
to expect letters from him, it was
now, &s;he thought, time to &s;ubdue, for &s;he
<PB N="44" REF="46">
per&s;uaded her&s;elf that never again they
would bring to her any thing but angui&s;h
and regret: and yet by tho&s;e contradict|ing
&s;en&s;ations to which violent attachments
&s;ubject the human heart, &s;he ince&s;&s;antly
indulged her&s;elf in thinking of all tho&s;e
happy hours which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed with
him, whom &s;he fancied de&s;erved little or
no regret, of whom &s;he ought not to think
at all, and yet was &s;o fond of recollecting,
that every conver&s;ation was irk&s;ome to
her, and every employment a ta&s;k, which
took off her attention a moment from him.</P>
<Q>Ti perdo! ti la&s;cio, non ti vedro piu&mdash;</Q>
<P>&s;he repeated ince&s;&s;antly to her&s;elf, &s;ome|times
with tears of tenderne&s;s, and &s;ome|times
with tho&s;e painful emotions of min|gled
anger and regret which pre&s;s on the
heart when pride and re&s;entment are &s;trug|gling
with affection. In other moods &s;he
reproached her&s;elf for thus cheri&s;hing this
unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, tried to recal tho&s;e days
of re&s;ignation when, without hope of ever
<PB N="45" REF="47">
being his, &s;he yet preferred Willoughby to
all mankind; and to di&s;mi&s;s from her mind
for ever the recollection of the few weeks
when he had awakened that hope, and
called forth all her &s;en&s;ibility only as it
&s;hould &s;eem to render her wretched; then
&s;he exclaimed in her native language&mdash;
<Q><L>Felicit&eacute; pa&s;&s;&eacute;e</L>
<L>Qui ne peut revenir</L>
<L>Tourment de ma pen&s;&eacute;e</L>
<L>Que n'ai je en te perdant, perdu le &s;ouvenir.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the&s;e gloomy moods, &s;he was quite
unable to remain a moment in company,
e&s;pecially in the company of Elphin&s;tone,
who, with the true projecter's infatuation,
fancied every body el&s;e as much intere&s;ted
about the fi&s;hery as he was; and per&s;ecuted
her with details of how many <HI>bu&s;&s;es</HI> he had
out and how many <HI>la&s;ts</HI> they had taken;
what was the be&s;t method of curing them,
and of the &s;uperiority which a few years
would give the fi&s;hery in which he was en|gaged,
over the Dutch.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">
Cele&s;tina began to dread the conver&s;a|tion;
and had it not been for Mrs. El|phin&s;tone,
of who&s;e &s;uffering merit &s;he
was every hour more &s;en&s;ible, &s;he would
not have forborne to expre&s;s her wearine&s;s
and di&s;gu&s;t. A hearer was nece&s;&s;ary to
Elphin&s;tone; and when he had' nobody
el&s;e to talk to, this unenviable place was
filled by the inwardly-impatient Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>It happened, however, that &s;he was re|lea&s;ed
from this for &s;ome days. Towards
the end of November, Elphin&s;tone went
to the I&s;le of Harries, on his bu&s;ine&s;s, as
he fancied, and the wind being again&s;t his
return, &s;he no longer li&s;tened. to the me|thod
of curing herrings, but returned to
her &s;hortened but le&s;s interrupted walks.
In one of the&s;e, towards the clo&s;e of a very
lowering and cheerle&s;s day, when her way
was along the rugged cliffs that, on the
we&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;land, hung over the
&s;ea, &s;he compo&s;ed the following &s;onnet:</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>ELPHINSTONE had now been
ab&s;ent &s;ome days, and the wind, which
was contrary and violent, prevented his
return to the place of his abode. Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone became unea&s;y at the &s;torms
which detained him, and Cele&s;tina parti|cipated
in her anxiety. At length the
wind &s;unk, and, towards the evening of
the fifth day of his ab&s;ence, was fair to
bring him from Herries. Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone,
who had been a good deal alarmed
by the hurricanes of &s;everal preceding
days, and had wearied her &s;pirits by watch|ing
the weather and. keeping an anxious
eye towards the impracticable &s;ea, found
her&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed and &s;hivering; and
telling Cele&s;tina that &s;he believed &s;he had
<PB N="49" REF="51">
caught cold, &s;he went early to bed, re|marking,
as &s;he bade her good night, that
Elphin&s;tone would probably be at home
in the morning.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, left alone, went out as was
her cu&s;tom, even although the evening
was already clo&s;ed in; and &s;tanding on
the edge of the rocks, near the hou&s;e, re|marked
the &s;ingular appearance of the
moon, which was now ri&s;ing. It was
large, and of a dull red, &s;urrounded by
clouds of a deep purple, who&s;e &s;kirts
&s;eemed touched with flame. Large vo|lumes
of heavy vapour were gathering in
the &s;ky, and the heaving &s;urges &s;welled
towards the &s;hore, and broke upon it with
that &s;ullen regularity that foretels a &s;torm.
From the North, aro&s;e di&s;tinctly the pointed
rays of the Aurora Borealis: fiery and
portentous, they &s;eemed to fla&s;h like faint
lightning a little while, till the moon be|coming
clearer, rendered them le&s;s vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Not a &s;ound was heard but the dull
murmurs of the &s;ea on one &s;ide and the
<PB N="50" REF="52">
rapid waterfalls on the other, who&s;e en|crea&s;ed
noi&s;e foretold with equal certainty
an approaching tempe&s;t. Cele&s;tina, who
was in that di&s;po&s;ition of mind to which
horrors are congenial, walked &s;lowly on
notwith&s;tanding; but quitting the cliffs,
on account of the gales of wind which now
blew from the &s;ea, &s;he went along a narrow
pa&s;s, where there was a cairn or heap of
&s;tones loo&s;ely piled together, the work of
the fir&s;t wild natives of the country; and
as that was as far as &s;he thought it proper
to venture from the hou&s;e, though it was
not more than eight o'clock, &s;he leaned
pen&s;ively again&s;t it, and watched with &s;ome
&s;urpri&s;e the fluctuations of the clouds that
were wildly driven by the wind acro&s;s the
di&s;k of the moon, and li&s;tened with a kind
of chill awe, to the loud yet hollow echo
of the wind among the hills; which &s;ome|times
&s;obbed with &s;tormy violence for a
moment, and then &s;uddenly &s;inking, was
&s;ucceeded by a pau&s;e more terrible.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">
It was in one of the&s;e moments of alarm|ing
&s;ilence, that Cele&s;tina thought &s;he &s;aw
the &s;hadow of a human form for a moment
on the ground, as if the per&s;on was behind
her who occa&s;ioned it. She was very little
&s;ubject to fear; but the loneline&s;s of the
place, and her own de&s;ponding &s;pirits to|gether,
made her &s;tart with terror and turn
round. Something immediately glided
away; and convinced that the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion
had not been the work of fancy,
&s;he ha&s;tened with quick &s;teps from the
place, and hardly at the di&s;tance of above
a hundred yards, ventured to look behind
her. She fancied that &s;he &s;aw a man
&s;tanding in the place &s;he had left; and the
&s;trange &s;uper&s;titions of the i&s;lands, of
which &s;he had heard much &s;ince her re&s;id|ing
on them, crowding at that moment on
her mind, &s;he became extremely terrified,
and hurried on with &s;uch unguarded &s;peed,
that a little before &s;he reached the hou&s;e
&s;he trod on a loo&s;e &s;tone, that turned under
her foot, and &s;he fell with &s;ome violence
<PB N="52" REF="54">
and with con&s;iderable pain; which, toge|ther
with the fear &s;he had before felt, pro|duced
a momentary &s;tupor, from which
&s;he was awakened by finding her&s;elf eagerly
rai&s;ed from the ground by &s;ome per&s;on,
who wildly expre&s;&s;ed his fears for her
&s;afety, and in who&s;e voice &s;he recognized,
with a&s;toni&s;hment that deprived her of ut|terance,
Montague Thorold. Surprize at
that moment conquered the pain &s;he felt:
"Oh! Mr. Montague!" cried &s;he, "is
it po&s;&s;ible? For heaven's &s;ake what
brought you hither?"</P>
<P>"No matter what," replied he eagerly:
"think not&mdash;a&s;k not about me!&mdash;when
you are your&s;elf hurt&mdash;in pain&mdash;brui&s;ed, I
fear, by your fall!"</P>
<P>"I have no hurt &s;o great," &s;aid Cele&s;|tina,
ri&s;ing and attempting to walk: "I feel
no bodily pain &s;o acute, as that which your
extraordinary conduct gives me."</P>
<P>"Let me a&s;&s;i&s;t you into the hou&s;e," in|terrupted
he. "Do you not &s;ee that the
tempe&s;t, which has been gathering the
<PB N="53" REF="55">
whole evening in the &s;outh-we&s;t, is now
driving hither with uncommon fury?"</P>
<P>"And let it come," an&s;wered &s;he lan|guidly:
"I am ju&s;t now &s;o very unhappy
my&s;elf&mdash;I feel &s;o much for the unhappine&s;s
of my friends, particularly of your father,
that it is indifferent to me what comes."</P>
<P>"It is not for <HI>me,</HI> at lea&s;t, that you
feel," an&s;wered he: "that I know but
too well: but undoubtedly you will be
greatly concerned for poor Elphin&s;tone,
who&s;e boat has been beating about ever
&s;ince night-fall, within a mile of the &s;hore,
at the imminent hazard of being da&s;hed to
pieces."</P>
<P>At this information Cele&s;tina forgot her|&s;elf,
forgot the unea&s;y a&s;toni&s;hment into
which the unexpected pre&s;ence of Monta|gue
Thorold had thrown her, and the
danger of Elphin&s;tone occupied all her
thoughts. "Oh! where!" cried &s;he,
"where is he? Shew me the bark which
is in &s;o much hazard, and for heaven's
<PB N="54" REF="56">
&s;ake call the people, who are not, perhaps,
aware of it's danger."</P>
<P>"Alas!" an&s;wered he, "&s;everal men
have been upon the &s;hore above half an
hour, alarmed, as I was, at the danger the
ve&s;&s;el was in of &s;triking on the rocks, which
&s;he has got among from the unexpected
&s;hifting of the wind; but in their pre&s;ent
&s;tate no human a&s;&s;i&s;tance can do them any
&s;ervice."</P>
<P>He had, during this dialogue, taken her
arm, and led her towards a point of the
rock, where &s;he &s;aw, by the pale and uncer|tain
light of a moon, wrapped continually
in volumes of clouds, the boat &s;truggling
among the dark heavy waves which often
totally concealed it, and continually driven
by the &s;udden gu&s;ts of violent wind from
the point it was attempting to reach.</P>
<P>She now &s;aw and &s;huddered at the peril
of tho&s;e who were in it: but &s;till fancying
it was po&s;&s;ible to afford them a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
&s;he felt impatient and almo&s;t angry that
Montague Thorold, holding her arm
<PB N="55" REF="57">
within his, &s;tood gazing when &s;he fancied
he might be helping. "Why &s;tand here,"
cried &s;he, "when we might be of u&s;e in
&s;ummoning people to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e
poor creatures?" While &s;he yet &s;poke,
and while Montague, though not le&s;s alive
to their di&s;tre&s;s, was le&s;s &s;anguine in the
hope to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and therefore &s;till he&s;itated,
&s;he di&s;engaged her&s;elf ha&s;tily from
his arm, and flew towards the hou&s;e, no
longer con&s;cious of any thing but their
danger: before &s;he could reach it, though
the di&s;tance was not a quarter of a mile, the
wind &s;uddenly blew with treble fury, and
a hail &s;torm accompanied it, again&s;t which
&s;he found it difficult to &s;tand. She found the
door open, and Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, whom
the wind and the talking of the &s;ervants
had awakened, already below. Trembling
with apprehen&s;ion, which the &s;udden ap|pearance
of Cele&s;tina encrea&s;ed&mdash;"Good
God, my dear friend, what is the matter?"
cried &s;he, "and why are you out in &s;o
dreadful a night?"</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58">
"Ah! dear Madam!" replied Cele&s;tina:
"Mr. Elphin&s;tone&mdash;his boat&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What of him?" interrupted her terri|fied
friend: "is he drowned? is he lo&s;t?"</P>
<P>"No, no! I hope, I believe not," cried
Cele&s;tina; "but a boat, which they &s;ay
is his, is beating off the i&s;land, and the
people are afraid it will go to pieces."</P>
<P>This was enough for the unhappy Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone, who &s;eeing, in it's mo&s;t dread|ful
light, the evil which threatened her,
now ran her&s;elf wildly towards the beach;
while Cele&s;tina, overtaking her with diffi|culty,
per&s;uaded her to accept her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance&mdash;a&s;&s;i&s;tance
which &s;he was very little
able to give.</P>
<P>The &s;ad event had happened before the
trembling friends had reached the head|land.
The boat &s;triking on the &s;unken
rocks, to &s;ave it from which the united
efforts of the little crew had been exerted
in vain, was &s;taved to pieces, and the
unhappy men, already exhau&s;ted with fa|tigue,
were unable to re&s;i&s;t by &s;wimming,
<PB N="57" REF="59">
the violence of the &s;ea. Mrs. Elphin&s;tone
and Cele&s;tina looked out in vain for the
place where a few moments before the boat
had been &s;een: no ve&s;tige of it remained,
and they &s;aw only, by the waining moon,
which but &s;erved to lend new horrors to the
view, the wild waves da&s;hing over the&s;e
rocks in &s;heets of white foam; while the
fury of the winds and the beating of the
rain hardly allowed them to &s;tand on the
precipice that overlooked the &s;cene of
&s;tormy de&s;olation.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina doubted but little of the cala|mity,
and therefore endeavoured to per|&s;uade
her unfortunate friend to return to
the hou&s;e; but this was impo&s;&s;ible: &s;he
continued to wander backwards and for|wards
for &s;ome moments, till terror quite
overcame her; and &s;he threw her&s;elf on
the ground, &s;aying, in a low and &s;olemn
voice to Cele&s;tina&mdash;"Elphin&s;tone is
drowned; I know he is; and here I will
wait to &s;ee his corps, which will be driven
on &s;hore in the morning." Then &s;tarting
<PB N="58" REF="60">
up, &s;he would have gone down to the
&s;hore, from an idea which &s;uddenly oc|curred
to her that he might yet be &s;aved
by &s;wimming. Cele&s;tina, not knowing
whether it was be&s;t to prevent or to in|dulge
her, unable to di&s;&s;imulate and affect
hope &s;he did not feel, was in a &s;ituation
hardly better than that of her di&s;tracted
friend whom &s;he &s;upported, when Mon|tague
Thorold joined them. Mrs. El|phin&s;tone,
occupied only by the terror of
the moment, took no notice of the extra|ordinary
circum&s;tance of a &s;tranger, whom
&s;he had never &s;een before, thus &s;uddenly
appearing; but uncon&s;cious of every
thing, and heedle&s;s of who he was, re|que&s;ted
in accents of piercing angui&s;h his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to help her down the winding
path which led to the beach. He lent it,
though very certain that the cata&s;trophe
had already taken place which by her ea|ger
and wild enquiries he &s;aw &s;he yet
thought doubtful; and giving her one
arm, while with the other he cla&s;ped the
<PB N="59" REF="61">
trembling hand of Cele&s;tina, they reached
the place, where &s;even or eight men were
already a&s;&s;embled. The moon was by
this time down, and the darkne&s;s was only
broken by livid fla&s;hes of faint lightning,
which, with the thunder muttering at a
di&s;tance, encrea&s;ed the horrors of the
&s;torm. Amid the black and &s;welling
waves, however, objects were &s;een floating,
and many of the&s;e heavy &s;eas had not
broken on the &s;hore, before the&s;e objects
were di&s;cerned to be the bodies of tho&s;e
who had peri&s;hed, and that of the ill fated
Elphin&s;tone was one of the fir&s;t which was
thrown on the beach, and too well known
by his unhappy wife. She now no longer
remembered all the cau&s;es of unea&s;ine&s;s
that her hu&s;band had given her; but &s;aw
only Elphin&s;tone, once &s;o fondly beloved,
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of her fir&s;t affections, the fa|ther
of her children, a disfigured corp&s;e
before her. Her native &s;trength of under|&s;tanding,
and the calmne&s;s acquired by
habitual &s;uffering, for&s;ook her at once, and

grief produced a momentary phrenzy, dur|ing
which fearful paroxy&s;m, Cele&s;tina, who&s;e
pre&s;ence of mind was now &s;ummoned to
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her poor unhappy friend,
had her conveyed with great difficulty to
the hou&s;e; where Montague Thorold at|tending
them both with the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous
tenderne&s;s, &s;he watched for many days
over the di&s;ordered intellects of the ill fated
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone before &s;he &s;aw them re|&s;tored.
At length the violence of her af|fliction,
which Cele&s;tina found means to
&s;often by pre&s;enting her children continu|ally
to her, and talking to her of tho&s;e
that were ab&s;ent, &s;unk into the calm torpor
of de&s;pair. She heard nothing, &s;he &s;aw
nothing but the children, whom &s;he would
not &s;uffer to be a moment ab&s;ent from her;
and the agitation of her mind preying on
her &s;lender frame, &s;he was reduced to a
&s;tate of languor which made Cele&s;tina
tremble for her life.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina had, immediately after the fa|tal
event, written to Cathcart, de&s;iring his <PB N="61" REF="67">
directions, and even entreating him to
come, him&s;elf to fetch them all from a place
where there was now no rea&s;on for their
&s;tay. But &s;he knew that it mu&s;t be five
or &s;ix weeks before &s;he could have an an|&s;wer;
and hardly dared tru&s;t her&s;elf to
meditate on the &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s &s;he mu&s;t
in that time encounter.</P>
<P>Amid all the horrors however which had
&s;urrounded her, &s;he had not forgotten the
fears and alarms to which &s;he knew the ab|&s;ence
of Montague Thorold expo&s;ed his
father, her benefactor; &s;he &s;eized the fir&s;t
interval, after the death of Elphin&s;tone, to
urge to him the cruelty of his conduct,
and to entreat him to return home; but
he replied, that nothing on earth &s;hould
induce him to leave the place where &s;he
was, while there was a probability of his
being of u&s;e to her; and that whether &s;he
admitted him to &s;ee her, or drove her from
him, the i&s;land &s;hould be his re&s;idence
while &s;he remained in it. All that then
remained for her was, to write to Mr. Tho|rold,

<PB N="62" REF="68">
which &s;he did under cover to Cath|cart,
acquainting him as briefly as &s;he
could of the unexpected appearance of his
&s;on, and all that had happened &s;ince.</P>
<P>Having thus far acquitted her&s;elf, &s;he
found her&s;elf in a &s;ituation in which it was
almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for her to help receiving
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one to whom &s;he trembled
to be obliged, while &s;he knew it encou|raged
and augmented a pa&s;&s;ion that em|poi&s;oned
his life. On him, however, &s;he
was compelled to entru&s;t the regulation of
the la&s;t melancholy offices that were to
be performed for poor Elphin&s;tone, who
was interred in a little ruined chapel about
two miles from his late re&s;idence; his
wife con&s;enting reluctantly to this di&s;po&s;i|tion,
and taking opiates ince&s;&s;antly to pro|cure
that torpor which alone prevented the
more violent ebullitions of grief from &s;eiz|ing
her again, when the remains of her
hu&s;band were removed.</P>
<P>Recour&s;e to opiates became gradually a
habit with Mrs. Elphin&s;tone; and though
<PB N="63" REF="69">
Cele&s;tina trembled for the con&s;equences,
&s;he thought it almo&s;t inhuman to oppo&s;e
the application of any remedy, which, un|der
&s;uch circum&s;tances, won her friend
from &s;orrow even for an hour. Yet the
frequent ab&s;ences it occa&s;ioned, compelled
her to be very long and very often alone
with Montague Thorold, to who&s;e manly
tenderne&s;s on the late &s;ad occa&s;ion &s;he could
not be in&s;en&s;ible, and to who&s;e uncea&s;ing
attention &s;he was every hour more obliged.
In the fir&s;t conference they had held when
the melancholy event to which they had
been witne&s;&s;es allowed them to talk of
them&s;elves, Cele&s;tina, after urging him to
return to his father by every motive with
which rea&s;on and truth &s;upplied her, repeated
to him with great firmne&s;s her re&s;olution
never to marry if Willoughby was not her
hu&s;band, and repre&s;ented very forcibly the
cruelty as well as ab&s;urdity of his pur&s;uing
her; to which he replied, that he knew all
&s;he repre&s;ented before he came thither,
that his only wi&s;h was to be allowed to &s;ee
<PB N="64" REF="70">
her, though at a di&s;tance, and his only
gratification, that of being &s;uffered to
breathe the &s;ame air; that it was the na|tural
privilege of every human being to
pur&s;ue their happine&s;s when it injured no|body;
and that finding <HI>his</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in
being near her, though without even the
hope of her admitting him into her pre|&s;ence,
he had followed that axiom, and
had for &s;ome weeks, been the di&s;tant and
un&s;een companion of all her walks. "I
was the highlander," &s;aid he, "who &s;up|plied
the vacancy I had before taken care
to make when you went your excur&s;ion on
the water. I am the per&s;on of whom you
have &s;ometimes caught a glimp&s;e at a di&s;|tance,
and who would never have ap|proached
you nearer, had not my fears for
you the evening of the &s;torm thrown me
off my guard, and induced me to conceal
my&s;elf within a few yards of you, behind
tho&s;e piled up &s;tones again&s;t which you
leaned. Ah! I heard you &s;igh&mdash;I heard
the name of Willoughby repeated with
<PB N="65" REF="71">
tenderne&s;s! but I bore it all! and nothing,
believe me, nothing but your fall, your ap|parent
danger, could have compelled me
to break the vow I had made never to in|trude
upon you&mdash;never to offend you with
my unhappy pa&s;&s;ion!"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina could not help being affected
with the melancholy &s;olemnity with which
he uttered the&s;e words; but making an
effort to prevent his perceiving it, &s;he
&s;aid&mdash;"It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary now that
you again take up as much of &s;o proper a
re&s;olution as relates to not &s;peaking to me
on a topic which to you mu&s;t be u&s;ele&s;s,
and to me painful; and while you per&s;i&s;t in
remaining here, let me at lea&s;t owe it to
your complai&s;ance not to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by
declarations to which I cannot, ought not,
will not li&s;ten."</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, then laying his
hand on his heart, a&s;&s;ured her that if &s;he
would allow him only to &s;ee her, indulge
him only with being u&s;eful to her in her
pre&s;ent remote and comfortle&s;s re&s;idence,
<PB N="66" REF="72">
he never would again name to her the pa&s;|&s;ion
which he knew, he &s;aid, he mu&s;t carry
to the grave; and from that moment he
kept his word; though Cele&s;tina &s;aw, with
more emotion perhaps than the warme&s;t
declarations could have given her, his
painful &s;truggles and continual contention
with him&s;elf: but while her pity for him
encrea&s;ed, &s;he &s;tudied more carefully to
conceal from him that &s;he felt any, and
behaved with as much calm politene&s;s as
&s;he could have done towards the mo&s;t in|different
man in the world.</P>
<P>To beguile the tedious moments during
which they were compelled to wait the
hoped for arrival of Cathcart, and while
the &s;ea that &s;urrounded them was agitated
continually by the wintry tempe&s;t, Cele&s;|tina
had recour&s;e to the books with which
poor Elphin&s;tone, who, among all his
faults and errors, was not without ta&s;te,
had furni&s;hed a clo&s;et in the hou&s;e. Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone, moved by the repre&s;entations
of Cele&s;tina to attend to her health for the
<PB N="67" REF="73">
&s;ake of her children, who&s;e &s;ole dependance
was now on her, con&s;ented by degrees to
li&s;ten while Cele&s;tina read. Montague
Thorold, who&s;e re&s;idence was at the cot|tage
of a highlander that boa&s;ted of hav|ing
two rooms and a chimney, about a mile
farther on the i&s;land, was &s;ometimes ad|mitted
to the&s;e parties; and as Cele&s;tina
was &s;oon fatigued, and as he read remark|ably
well, Mrs. Elphin&s;tone appeared
plea&s;ed with his taking occa&s;ionally the
office of their reader, and gradually he
became accu&s;tomed to attend them every
afternoon, and to read aloud to them till
the hour of their &s;imple &s;upper.</P>
<P>Among the books in this little collection,
there were &s;everal that Cele&s;tina recollected
as the peculiar favourites of Willoughby;
and the remembrance of tho&s;e days when
heread them to her, though never a mo|ment
ab&s;ent from her thoughts, were now
mo&s;t forcibly recalled by hearing them
again repeated. Some pieces of poetry
particularly affected her, from their &s;imple
<PB N="68" REF="74">
pathos, and the manner in which Monta|gue
Thorold read them; while they often
drew tears from the unhappy Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone,
an effect at which Cele&s;tina rejoiced,
as her grief was now &s;ettled into that &s;till
and &s;ullen melancholy un&s;olicitous of con|&s;olation
and incapable of receiving it;
which, while it produces a degree of appa|rent
calmne&s;s, preys with fatal power on
the heart.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the heavy hours; till at
length, after a fortnight longer delay than
they had reckoned upon, letters were re|ceived
from Cathcart: they contained in|telligence
that old Winnington was dead,
and Je&s;&s;y in &s;uch a &s;tate of health as made
it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for Cathcart to leave
her. He therefore be&s;ouglit Cele&s;tina to
accept the protection of Montague Tho|rold
for her&s;elf, for Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, and
her children, and to ha&s;ten to his hou&s;e,
where he was now as able as happy to re|ceive
them, as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible and
&s;afe. Mr. Thorold wrote al&s;o to Cele&s;tina,
<PB N="69" REF="75">
and expre&s;&s;ed his hope that the wild eccen|tricity
of his &s;on, which had occa&s;ioned to
him &s;o much pain, might at lea&s;t be of
&s;ervice to her, and entreated her to allow
him to attend her and her unfortunate
friend into Devon&s;hire, where he a&s;&s;ured
her he would prevent her receiving any
trouble from the importunities of Monta|gue,
&s;hould he be weak enough to pre|&s;ume
too much on her favour. He wrote
al&s;o to his &s;on; but after the contents of
that letter Cele&s;tina did not enquire, and
Montague carefully concealed them.</P>
<P>It was now determined that the plan
laid down by Cathcart and Mr. Thorold
&s;hould be pur&s;ued. Montague undertook
the arrangement of every thing, and with|in
ten days they were ready to depart.</P>
<P>The weather alone &s;eemed now likely to
prevent their cro&s;&s;ing the water. Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone, who had till now feared no|thing,
being &s;o apprehen&s;ive for her chil|dren,
that every gu&s;t of wind, every &s;well
of the &s;ea, made her &s;hrink back with di&s;|may,
<PB N="70" REF="76">
and po&s;tpone from day to day a little
voyage which &s;he yet earne&s;tly wi&s;hed
over. It was the end of November, and
very good weather could hardly be ex|pected.
Dark and gloomy days, with
&s;torms of wind and rain, &s;ucceeded each
other; and Cele&s;tina, who&s;e thoughts had
been of late called frequently from her own
mournful contemplations to the acute di&s;|tre&s;&s;es
of others, now relap&s;ed again into
that de&s;ponding &s;tate of mind which her
long ab&s;ence from Willoughby and his
apparent neglect of her unavoidably threw
her into. She had confined her&s;elf a good
deal to the hou&s;e &s;ince Montague Thorold
had been &s;o much with them, becau&s;e
there either Mrs. Elphin&s;tone or the chil|dren
were u&s;ually in the room, and &s;he by
that means avoided being alone with him;
but now, as he was more engaged by the
preparations for their departure, which he
had undertaken to &s;uperintend, and in &s;et|tling
poor Elphin&s;tone's accounts with his
employers, Cele&s;tina again ventured out
<PB N="71" REF="77">
of an evening whenever &s;he could e&s;cape
un&s;een.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e walks, along the edge of
very &s;teep rocks, where the &s;cene pre&s;ented
only de&s;olation: the dark and turbulent
&s;ea on one &s;ide, and on the other a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of mountains, which &s;eemed to
have been thrown upon each other in &s;ome
tremendous convul&s;ion of nature, &s;he
turned towards the yet more dreary North,
and reflected on the condition of tho&s;e
whom the poet de&s;cribes as
<Q>The la&s;t of men,</Q>
the inhabitants of Siberia, of Lapland, and
tho&s;e extreme regions where
<Q>Life at la&s;t goes out.</Q></P>
<P>"Alas!" cried &s;he, "if they have not our
enjoyments, they &s;uffer not from tho&s;e &s;en|&s;ibilities
which embitter our days. Their
&s;hort &s;ummer pa&s;&s;es in laying up nece&s;&s;a|ries
for their long winter; and with what
their de&s;olate region affords them they
<PB N="72" REF="78">
are content, becau&s;e they know not that
there are comforts and conveniencies be|yond
what it affords them. Void of the
wi&s;h and the power to ob&s;erve other
modes of life, they are content with their
own, and though little &s;uperior in point
of intellect to the animal from which they
derive their &s;upport, yet they are happy,
if not from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of good, at
lea&s;t from the ab&s;ence of evil; from that
&s;ickne&s;s of the &s;oul which we ta&s;te from
deprivation and di&s;appointment."</P>
<P>A deep &s;igh clo&s;ed this &s;hort &s;oliloquy;
and after indulging a little longer this
train of thought, it produced the follow|ing
&s;onnet:</P>
<Q><LG>
<PB N="73" REF="79">
<HEAD>THE LAPLANDER.</HEAD>
<L>The &s;hivering native, who by Tenglio's &s;ide</L>
<L>Beholds with fond regret the parting light</L>
<L>Sink far away, beneath the darkening tide,</L>
<L>And leave him to long months of dreary night,</L>
<L>Yet knows, that &s;pringing from the ea&s;tern wave,</L>
<L>The &s;un's glad beams &s;hall re-illume his way,</L>
<L>And, from the &s;nows, &s;ecur'd within his cave,</L>
<L>He waits in patient hope&mdash;returning day.</L>
<L>Not &s;o the &s;ufferer feels, who, o'er the wa&s;te</L>
<L>Of joyle&s;s life, is de&s;tin'd to deplore</L>
<L>Fond love forgotten, tender friend&s;hip pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Which, once extinqui&s;h'd, can revive no more:</L>
<L>O'er the blank void he looks with hopele&s;s pain;</L>
<L>For him tho&s;e beams of heaven &s;hall never &s;hine again.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>A few days after this, an interval of
calm weather gave to Mrs. Elphin&s;tone
courage to determine on embarking: but
the evening before that on which it was
finally fixed that they &s;hould go, &s;he told
Cele&s;tina, with a &s;olemnity of voice and
manner that convinced her &s;he was not to
be diverted from her purpo&s;e, that &s;he
could not be &s;atisfied to leave the i&s;land
without vi&s;iting the &s;pot where lay the re|mains
<PB N="74" REF="80">
of her hu&s;band. Cele&s;tina, without
much hope of &s;ucce&s;s, repre&s;ented to her
how wrong it was to yield, or rather to en|courage
&s;orrow, unavailing to it's object,
and injurious to tho&s;e who were his living
repre&s;entatives, by depriving her of her calm|ne&s;s
of mind when exertion was mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary,
and injuring her own health, now &s;o par|ticularly
precious to them. To the&s;e argu|ments
her poor friend replied, with melan|choly
compo&s;ure, that &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer more
in reflecting on her omi&s;&s;ion than &s;he could
do in fulfilling what &s;he had per&s;uaded her|&s;elf
was a duty. Cele&s;tina therefore agreed
to accompany her that evening. Monta|gue
Thorold had already &s;hewn her the
place, and Mrs. Elphin&s;tone de&s;ired to
have no other witne&s;s to her &s;orrows, than
the &s;oft hearted and pitying friend, without
who&s;e generous &s;ympathy &s;he would pro|bably
long before have &s;unk under them.</P>
<P>It was near two months &s;ince the death
of Elphin&s;tone, when this melancholy fare|wel
vi&s;it was to be paid by his widow. A
<PB N="75" REF="81">
calm but &s;ullen day, with an overclouded
&s;ky, threatening &s;now, was &s;ucceeded by a
dark but mild evening. The di&s;tant &s;un
had left a few lines of red light in the
we&s;tern horizon; and the moon, within a
day or two of being at the full, edged with
fainter rays the oppo&s;ite clouds, through
which it appeared not but at intervals.
The unhappy widow, leaning on the arm
of her tender friend, walked &s;lowly and
with languid &s;teps, as &s;he was guided to|wards
the ruined chapel, and a univer&s;al
pau&s;e of nature &s;eemed to re&s;pect her &s;or|rows!
Not a breath of air wandered
among the channels of the hills, and the
waterfalls murmured low and hollow at a
di&s;tance; the &s;ea was calm, and being low
on the &s;ands, was hardly heard; while the
birds, and few animals who inhabited the
land, were retired to their repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Around this little chapel, now more than
half in ruins, a few rude &s;tones were rai&s;ed
to the memory of the dead of former times.
The gra&s;s and weeds concealed many, and
<PB N="76" REF="82">
on the re&s;t no figures but tho&s;e of cro&s;&s;es
rudely cut were now vi&s;ible. Elphin&s;tone
had been interred within the walls of the
edifice it&s;elf; his widow de&s;ired her friend
to enter it with her, to &s;hew her the place,
and to leave her.</P>
<P>As they approached the &s;pot, the ground
&s;ounded hollow beneath their feet, and a
mournful echo ran round the damp walls.
The moon, darting for a moment through
the ruined &s;tone work of the di&s;mantled
window, &s;hewed them a broken table that
had once been the altar, on which &s;ome
pieces of the gothic ornaments of the cha|pel,
and &s;everal human bones, were &s;cat|tered,
and near it, the newly turned up
earth, on which a few &s;tones were loo&s;ely
piled, di&s;covered the grave of poor El|phin&s;tone.
Cele&s;tina could not tru&s;t her
voice to point it out; but leading her
friend to it, &s;he immediately comprehended
that there lay the remains of her hu&s;band,
and fetching a deep &s;igh, &s;he &s;topped at it.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="83">
"I had better not leave you &s;urely,"
cried Cele&s;tina mournfully. "I cannot
bear to leave you in this dreadful place."</P>
<P>"Pray oblige me," replied her friend;
"it is the la&s;t indulgence I will a&s;k, and I
promi&s;e not to &s;tay long."</P>
<P>"I will wait for you without then," re|plied
Cele&s;tina; "and pray, dear Sophy,
con&s;ider your children, and let it not be
long that you indulge this &s;ad propen&s;ity."</P>
<P>She then went out of the chapel; and
&s;eating her&s;elf on one of the ruined, monu|ments
near it's entrance, yielded to all the
gloomy thoughts which the place, the hour,
and the occa&s;ion in&s;pired. "Ah! who
knows," cried &s;he, "whether I too may
not have rea&s;on to lament even as this poor
mourner, who&s;e groans tear my heart to
pieces while I li&s;ten to them! I hear her!
&s;he implores forgivene&s;s of the &s;hade of
her departed hu&s;band for all the involun|tary
offences &s;he committed again&s;t him:
&s;he, who&s;e whole life has been one cour&s;e
of &s;uffering, &s;olicits forgivene&s;s of him to
<PB N="78" REF="84">
whom tho&s;e &s;ufferings were owing: &s;he
forgets his faults towards her, and recol|lects
only that he once loved her, that he
was the hu&s;band of her youth, and that he
is gone for ever; while &s;he trembles for
the future fate of him, who&s;e errors &s;he only
remembers to recommend them to mercy!
Dreadful then is the final &s;eparation even
from tho&s;e, of whom, though we have rea|&s;on
to complain, we have once loved: ah!
what mu&s;t it be when an eternal barrier is
put between us and tho&s;e whom we unre|&s;ervedly
and pa&s;&s;ionately love. Willough|by!
if I have regretted &s;o deeply our &s;e|paration,
what would become of me &s;hould
I ever hang over the grave where thy
adored form moulders in the du&s;t. Oh!
God! grant that I never &s;u&s;tain a trial like
that!"</P>
<P>Overwhelmed by the&s;e &s;ad thoughts,
and terrified at the encrea&s;ing darkne&s;s and
fearful &s;ilence, which was broken only by
the deep &s;ighs of her unhappy friend pro&s;|trate
on the grave of her hu&s;band, &s;he
<PB N="79" REF="85">
&s;tarted up to recall her from her mournful
employment, when Montague Thorold,
breathle&s;s with ha&s;te and anxiety, ap|proached
her; &s;he was glad to recognize
him, and took the hand he offered her;
while he cried impatiently&mdash;"Wherefore
is all this, my dear Madam, and where is
your friend?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina led him to the place, &s;hudder|ing
as &s;he approached, while Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone,
recovering her&s;elf by an effort of
re&s;olution, and having perhaps di&s;burthened
her oppre&s;&s;ed heart and &s;atisfied her
mournful propen&s;ity, agreed immediately
to go with them, and having turned once
more her &s;treaming eyes on the &s;pot as &s;he
quitted the chapel, &s;he &s;uffered each of her
friends to take an arm, and lead her home
in &s;ilence; where Montague Thorold ad|vi&s;ed
her and Cele&s;tina to take immediately
a few hours re&s;t, as the tide would &s;erve
very early in the morning for their em|barkation
in the ve&s;&s;el which now lay ready
to receive them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mrs. Elphin&s;tone was too much de|jected
to allow her to go out, Cele&s;tina, who
had great plea&s;ure in vi&s;iting antiquities, and
who&s;e active mind was perpetually in &s;earch
of new ideas, was compelled either to relin|qui&s;h
the&s;e gratifications, or to permit
Montague Thorold only to accompany
her. He was generally &s;o guarded in his
conver&s;ation, that, though it was ea&s;y to
&s;ee how much he &s;uffered in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
his pa&s;&s;ion, Cele&s;tina had no rea&s;onable
ground of complaint. He found, how|ever,
at Edinburgh, that it was particularly
unea&s;y to her to vi&s;it the places &s;he wi&s;hed
to &s;ee without &s;ome other companion, and
recollecting that one of the profe&s;&s;ors was
well known to his father, he made u&s;e of
<PB N="82" REF="92">
the claim that acquaintance gave him, and
by that means Cele&s;tina received all the at|tention
and ho&s;pitality for which the Scot|ti&s;h
nation are &s;o ju&s;tly prai&s;ed. The gen|tleman
to whom &s;he thus became known,
had &s;everal daughters, amiable and ele|gant
young women: with them &s;he &s;aw all
that the capital of Scotland afforded wor|thy
of ob&s;ervation; with them &s;he vi&s;ited
the ruinous chapel and magnificently
mournful apartments of Holyrood Hou&s;e,
and gave a &s;igh to the fate of the lovely,
luckle&s;s Mary, who was almo&s;t its la&s;t re&s;i|dent
&s;overeign. Then parting with her
newly acquired friends with mutual regret,
&s;he proceeded on her road to England,
nothing particular occurring on the way
for &s;ome time except the &s;low but evident
amendment of Mrs. Elphin&s;tone's &s;pirits,
and the &s;ymptoms of encrea&s;ed attachment
in Montague Thorold; who, if he loved
her before with an attachment fatal to his
peace and &s;ubver&s;ive of his pro&s;pects, now
&s;eemed to idolize her with an ardour bor|dering
<PB N="83" REF="93">
on phrenzy. In de&s;pite of the re&s;olu|tions
&s;he had avowed to him, in de&s;pite
of tho&s;e he had him&s;elf formed, this ar|dent
and invincible pa&s;&s;ion was vi&s;ible in
every thing he &s;aid and did. He &s;eemed
to have forgotten that he had any other
bu&s;ine&s;s in the world than to &s;erve her, to
li&s;ten to the enchantment of her voice, to
watch every change of her countenance.
His whole being was ab&s;orbed in that one
&s;entiment; and though he had promi&s;ed
not to con&s;ider the advantages, which his
own wild Quixoti&s;m, aided by accident,
had thus obtained for him, as making the
lea&s;t alteration in the decided preference
of Cele&s;tina for another, he in&s;en&s;ibly for|got,
at lea&s;t at times, her unalterable affec|tion
for Willoughby; and &s;eeing, notwith|&s;tanding
all her attempts to conceal it, that
&s;he pitied him, that &s;he was not in&s;en&s;ible
of his attempts to plea&s;e her nor blind to
his powers of plea&s;ing, he cheri&s;hed, in
defiance of rea&s;on and conviction (from
which he fled as much as po&s;&s;ible) the ex|travagant
<PB N="84" REF="94">
hope that the barrier, whatever
it was, between her and Willoughby would
be found invincible, and that the time,
though it might yet be remote, would at
length arrive when he &s;hould him&s;elf be
allowed to a&s;pire to her favour.</P>
<P>The human mind, however &s;trong,
yields too ea&s;ily to the&s;e illu&s;ions, whence
at lea&s;t it enjoys the &s;oft con&s;olations of
hope, and &s;ees rays of light, which, though
imaginary, perhaps are all we often have to
carry us on with courage over the rugged
way, too thickly &s;own with real, or, mi&s;&s;ing
them, with imaginary and &s;elf-created evils.</P>
<P>It is therefore little to be wondered at, if
Montague Thorold, &s;o &s;anguine in tem|perament,
of &s;o little experience in life,
(for he was yet hardly twenty two) and &s;o
much in love, &s;hould thus eagerly feed
him&s;elf with hopes of its ultimate &s;ucce&s;s,
and be wilfully deaf to every argument
which rea&s;on would have brought again&s;t
the reality of the gay vi&s;ions he cheri&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="95">
Cele&s;tina, pitying and e&s;teeming him,
was very anxious to reduce this unhappy
and fruitle&s;s prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the bounds of
friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, and though &s;he at this
time thought of Willoughby with &s;o much
internal angui&s;h that &s;he never on other
occa&s;ions willingly named him, yet &s;he
now took occa&s;ion &s;ometimes to &s;peak of
him, and purpo&s;ely laid her train of con|ver&s;ation
in &s;uch a way with Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone,
as gave Montague Thorold to un|der&s;tand
that her &s;entiments in regard to
him who had fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and &s;till was
ma&s;ter of her heart, could never &s;uffer any
material change, or be transferred to ano|ther,
even though &s;he was &s;ure that &s;he
was per&s;onally divided from him for ever.</P>
<P>After &s;ome days travelling, which the lan|guor
of Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, and her extreme
anxiety about her children, rendered tedious,
the party arrived at York, and there it was
determined to remain two days. Cele&s;tina,
who had nobody to receive her at the end
of her pilgrimage with peculiar delight,
<PB N="86" REF="96">
was not very eager to fini&s;h it; Mrs. El|phin&s;tone,
&s;eeing nothing but poverty and
dependence before her, of which her mind,
being enfeebled by grief, was little able to bear
a nearer pro&s;pect, was yet le&s;s anxious; and
Montague Thorold cared not how long a
journey la&s;ted which gave him what he
mu&s;t at its termination lo&s;e, the happine&s;s
of being with, and of being u&s;eful to the
mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart.</P>
<P>When they arrived at York, there was
an appearance of &s;now; it fell with violence
during the night, and by ten o'clock the
next morning the north road was rendered
impa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>The travellers were well a&s;&s;ured that
in a day or two it would be &s;ufficiently
beat for them to proceed with &s;afety, and
as their original intention was to remain at
lea&s;t two days, the farther immaterial delay
with which this circum&s;tance threatened
them, gave to none of them any concern.</P>
<P>The &s;now, however, continued to fall
very heavily, and the cold became almo&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="97">
in&s;upportably &s;evere. The party were
drawn round a good fire at the inn, and
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone had ju&s;t put her children
to bed, when an unu&s;ual clamour and bu&s;tle
below attracted their attention. Hor&s;es
were called for, and a loud voice was heard
to &s;ay&mdash;"If four are not &s;ufficient, my
ma&s;ter will have fourteen rather than be
&s;topped a moment."</P>
<P>"This is &s;ome matrimonial expedition,"
cried Montague Thorold, "or why all
this ha&s;te?" The idea, which the ladies
allowed to be probable, excited &s;ome de|gree
of curio&s;ity, and when the waiter &s;oon
after came in to lay the cloth for &s;upper,
Montague could not forbear enquiring if
the hor&s;es which were a &s;hort time before
&s;o eagerly called for were not for the ac|commodation
of a young couple ha&s;tening
into Scotland. The man replied that the
gentleman was going into Scotland, and
had been &s;topped by the &s;now about &s;even
miles off, the hor&s;es he had to his chai&s;e
being unable, to draw him; but that he
<PB N="88" REF="98">
under&s;tood he was quite alone, that hor&s;es
and men had been &s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
that he was expected there pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The man, who probably loved to hear
him&s;elf talk, went on to inform them,
though they now no longer felt any great
degree of curio&s;ity, that the gentleman's
valet de chambre and one of the po&s;tillions,
who had come forward, (who were warming
them&s;elves at the fire below before they re|turned
back as they were ordered,) had de|clared
that they were almo&s;t dead with
cold; "but as for that, Sir," continued
the waiter, "he &s;ays, that is, Sir, the <HI>wa|let
de &s;ham</HI> &s;ays, &s;ays he, my ma&s;ter if
once he've got a &s;cheme in his head, 'tis
not cold, no nor water, nor fire neither,
<HI>as</HI> will find it an ea&s;y matter to &s;top him,
and then, &s;ays he, as. for fatigue to his
own &s;elf, &s;ays he, or danger, or any thing
of the like nature, or expence, though it
co&s;t him a hundred, aye or a thou&s;and
pounds, why my ma&s;ter, &s;ays he, minds
it no more than nothing; 'tis all one to
<PB N="89" REF="99">
him; yet to be &s;ure, &s;ays he, he is a good
ma&s;ter in the main, and no &s;neaker, nei|ther
in money, nor liquor, nor no other
accommodation to &s;ervants."</P>
<P>"And pray," &s;aid Montague Thorold,
"who is this courageous, bountiful, and
accommodating gentleman?"</P>
<P>"I did not think to a&s;k his name, Sir,"
replied the waiter, "but I can know in a
minute." He then, without waiting for
an an&s;wer, ran down &s;tairs, and returning
almo&s;t in&s;tantly, &s;aid that the gentleman
was 'Squire Vava&s;our of Stafford&s;hire.</P>
<P>"Vava&s;our!" cried Cele&s;tina in a faint
voice, and turning as pale as death.
"Good Heaven! to what purpo&s;e can
Vava&s;our be travelling in &s;uch ha&s;te to|wards
Scotland."</P>
<P>"Vava&s;our!" echoed Montague Tho|rold,
his countenance betraying all that
pa&s;&s;ed in his heart: "Vava&s;our! Ah!
Mi&s;s De Mornay, it was to you he was
undoubtedly going. Willoughby is re|turned,
<PB N="90" REF="100">
and &s;ends his friend to reclaim his
betrothed wife."</P>
<P>"Sends his friend! oh! no, no," an|&s;wered
Cele&s;tina with quickne&s;s, "that
cannot be: were Willoughby returned, he
would not <HI>&s;end;</HI> rather it is &s;ome &s;ad news
he has to impart, and I mu&s;t prepare my|&s;elf
for it&mdash;I mu&s;t bear it be it what it
may."</P>
<P>The cruelle&s;t anxiety now took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of both Cele&s;tina and Montague Thorold;
they both dreaded an explanation, though
unable to bear the &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Thorold
went down to &s;ee what he could gather
from the men; but Mr. Vava&s;our's &s;ervant
was gone back to meet his ma&s;ter, and the
po&s;tillion had only come with him from the
la&s;t po&s;t town. Cele&s;tina in the mean
time now traver&s;ed the room, now went
to the window, and now appeared to at|tend
to the conjectures Mrs. Elphin&s;tone
offered, that perhaps this journey might in
no re&s;pect relate to her, but might be ow|ing
to one of tho&s;e &s;udden &s;tarts of caprice
<PB N="91" REF="101">
in which Vava&s;our was known to indulge
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and conjecture,
which is of all others lea&s;t ea&s;y to be borne,
did not la&s;t long, for in about a quarter of
an hour the carriage, in which Vava&s;our
him&s;elf was, arrived.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina now debated within her&s;elf
whether &s;he ought to &s;end to him, to in|form
him of her being on her way to Eng|land,
or &s;uffer him to proceed, whither
&s;he doubted not he was going, even to the
Hebrides in &s;earch of her. This internal
debate was however &s;hort: her extreme
&s;olicitude to have news of Willoughby &s;u|perceded
every other thought; and whe|ther
Vava&s;our was going to Scotland to an|nounce
her fate to her by the direction of
Willoughby, or merely in con&s;equence of
&s;ome whim of his own, &s;he knew that he
in all probability could give her &s;ome in|telligence
of him of whom &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed
to hear. Montague Thorold, who trem|bled
lea&s;t in con&s;equence of this interview
<PB N="92" REF="102">
all the day dreams in which he had been
indulging him&s;elf &s;hould be at once de|&s;troyed,
would have repre&s;ented to her
&s;ome imaginary improprieties which his
wi&s;h to find them rai&s;ed in his mind.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, however, had, with all her can|dour
and humility, a deci&s;ive &s;pirit, the ef|fect
of her great good &s;en&s;e, which, when
&s;he had once examined and determined on
any &s;ubject, did not leave her open to the
trifling perplexities of feeble and unim|portant
debate. She con&s;idered, that even
if Vava&s;our <HI>was</HI> going on &s;ome eccentric
idea of his own to follow her into Scot|land,
it would be cruel and unju&s;t to &s;uf|fer
him to pur&s;ue &s;uch a journey at &s;uch a
&s;ea&s;on, and therefore &s;teadily re&s;i&s;ting all
the repre&s;entations of Montague Thorold
again&s;t it, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed to him the follow|ing
note:</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s de Mornay pre&s;ents her compli|ments
to Mr. Vava&s;our, and having
learned by accident that he is at this
<PB N="93" REF="103">
place, reque&s;ts the favour of &s;eeing him
to-morrow morning to breakfa&s;t with
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone and with her at half
pa&s;t nine."</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, being unable wholly
to prevent, thought he could at lea&s;t im|pede
the delivery of this note till the next
day; but Cele&s;tina was too impatient to
hear of Willoughby to be blind to the ar|tifice
which Montague was too much in
love to manage very dexterou&s;ly, and
therefore quitting the room her&s;elf, &s;he
found one of the waiters, who &s;he enjoined
to give the note to the gentleman who was
ju&s;t arrived, as &s;oon as he had done &s;upper.</P>
<P>This was not perhaps very di&s;creet: but
Cele&s;tina thought much at the moment of
Willoughby, and very little of Vava&s;our,
and in her anxiety to hear news of the
one, &s;he reflected not on the way in which
it might be conveyed by the other, who,
after a long and cold journey, having fi|ni&s;hed
his &s;upper, was not likely at lea&s;t to
<PB N="94" REF="104">
be a clear and calm me&s;&s;enger, and a mo|ment's
reflection would have convinced her
that he was not a man who from motives of
delicate forbearance and polite deference
would put off the interview to the time &s;he
had named.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the note from Cele&s;tina
delivered to Vava&s;our, than he ran up
&s;tairs with an impatience amounting al|mo&s;t
to phrenzy, his eyes fla&s;hing fire, and
his countenance expre&s;&s;ive of the violent
emotions with which he was agitated; he
hardly noticed Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, but ca&s;t|ing
a look of angry &s;urpri&s;e at Montague
Thorold, whom he immediately knew, he
approached Cele&s;tina, took her hand, and
eagerly ki&s;&s;ing it, told her in a hurried
manner that he was ha&s;tening to Scotland
to give her intelligence of very great con|&s;equence,
and to deliver her a packet from
Willoughby.</P>
<P>"From Willoughby!" replied Cele&s;tina,
&s;o extremely affected by his abrupt entrance
<PB N="95" REF="105">
that &s;he was ready to faint. "Is he well?
is he returned to England?"</P>
<P>"No," replied he, without &s;eeming
&s;en&s;ible of the nature of her &s;ufferings,
"not returned to England, or likely to re|turn,
but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Is he married then?" &s;aid Cele&s;tina,
interrupting him in a &s;till more trembling
voice.</P>
<P>"Not yet, but I have a letter for you
which&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Give it me," cried &s;he, hardly able
to breathe. He had it not about him, but
ringing for his &s;ervant, gave him the key
of his portmanteau, and bidding him bring
a large &s;ealed packet, which he &s;aid he
would find there, the man immediately re|turned
with it; and Cele&s;tina, without
&s;peaking to Vava&s;our, hurried away with
it in breathle&s;s agitation, Mrs. Elphin&s;tone,
alarmed at her looks, following her in &s;i|lence.</P>
<P>All this time Montague Thorold had re|mained
leaning again&s;t one of the piers:
<PB N="96" REF="106">
with contracted brows and cla&s;ped hands
watching the countenance of Cele&s;tina,
while his own changed from pale to red,
from red again to pale. He had always
returned the di&s;like which Vava&s;our had
&s;hewn towards him as much as his nature
could return di&s;like; and this was en|crea&s;ed
by the abrupt and unfeeling man|ner
in which Vava&s;our had executed a com|mi&s;&s;ion,
that, whether it brought to her
welcome or unwelcome tidings, demanded,
he thought, more delicacy and more pre|paration.
When Cele&s;tina and Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
were gone, he felt no inclination
therefore to &s;tay with Vava&s;our, who
walked up and down the room as if ex|pecting
their return; but was preparing to
leave it, when, as he cro&s;&s;ed to the door,
Vava&s;our, turning &s;hort towards him, a&s;ked
how he came to be at York with Mi&s;s De
Mornay.</P>
<P>"How I came, Sir!" replied Monta|tague
Thorold with equal abruptne&s;s.
"Have <HI>you</HI> any right, Sir, to enquire?"</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="107">
"Yes," replied Vava&s;our contemptu|ou&s;ly,
"I have a right."</P>
<P>"To enquire into my actions, Sir?" in|terrupted
Thorold; "&s;urely not!"</P>
<P>"To enquire into tho&s;e of Mi&s;s De Mor|nay,
Sir, <HI>I have</HI> a right."</P>
<P>"Well, Sir, if &s;he allows of that right,
to her you may then apply; but you will
be &s;o good as to leave me at liberty to be
at York, or wherever el&s;e it is convenient
to me to be."</P>
<P>"Not with her, Sir, you mu&s;t not; not
with Mi&s;s De Mornay, be a&s;&s;ured. As for
the re&s;t, pray under&s;tand, that were it not
for the circum&s;tance of your being &s;een in
company with her, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould never recollect
that &s;uch a per&s;on was in the world as Mr.
Montague Thorold."</P>
<P>Thorold, though naturally of a gentle
di&s;po&s;ition, was little di&s;po&s;ed to bear the
contemptuous arrogance of any man: he
therefore an&s;wered with more quickne&s;s,
that it was an honour he could well di&s;|pen&s;e
with, to be thought of at all by <HI>&s;uch</HI> a
<PB N="98" REF="108">
man as Mr. Vava&s;our. The tone in which
he &s;poke this, and the empha&s;is he laid on
the words <HI>&s;uch</HI> a man, provoked the
haughty and impetuous &s;pirit of Vava&s;our;
and words ro&s;e &s;o high between them, that
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, who was only in the
next room, came in, and extremely terri|fied
at their violence, be&s;ought them to
&s;eparate. Vava&s;our, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were
at all times too &s;trong to &s;uffer him to li&s;|ten
either to rea&s;on from others or to his
own, gave very little attention to her re|mon&s;trances;
but Montague Thorold, on
&s;eeing her extreme unea&s;ine&s;s, and on
hearing the name of Cele&s;tina, became in
a moment apparently calm; and a&s;&s;uring
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone that &s;he had no rea&s;on to
be alarmed, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf coolly
to Vava&s;our, and &s;aid, that if he had any
bu&s;ine&s;s with him he would be at his &s;er|vice
in the morning: he then be&s;ought
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone to return to Cele&s;tina;
and taking her hand, led her out of the
room, a&s;&s;uring her in a whi&s;per that he
<PB N="99" REF="109">
would not return that evening to Vava&s;our,
nor have any farther contention with him.
"Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, therefore, my dear
Madam," &s;aid he, "and tell me&mdash;how is
our lovely friend? what are the contents
of a letter which required &s;o extraordinary
a me&s;&s;enger?"</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphin&s;tone an&s;wered, that Cele&s;tina
had appeared in great emotion while &s;he
read the beginning of the letter, and then
telling her that &s;he &s;hould fini&s;h it in her
own room, had left her, in encrea&s;ed agi|tation
&s;he thought, but without tears.</P>
<P>"And &s;hall you &s;ee her no more to|night?"
enquired Montague Thorold.</P>
<P>"I rather believe not," replied Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone.</P>
<P>"And do you think," &s;aid Thorold,
"do you think, my dear Madam, that the
agitation, the emotion you remarked, was
the effect of joy, of grief&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Of grief, of di&s;appointment, of regret,
I think," an&s;wered &s;he. "I believe Ce|le&s;tina
is now convinced that every proba|bility
<PB N="100" REF="110">
of her becoming the wife of Mr.
Willoughby is at an end for ever."</P>
<P>"Then," cried Montague Thorold,
unable to repre&s;s the violence of his feel|ings;
"oh! then there will be hope for me!"</P>
<P>There was &s;omething like the tran&s;ports
of phrenzy in the manner in which he ut|tered
this, and Mrs. Elphin&s;tone was
&s;hocked at it. "Be not too &s;anguine, Mr.
Montague," &s;aid &s;he. "I do not believe
that the affections of Mi&s;s De Mornay are
to be ea&s;ily or lightly transferred, but if
they were, think of the powerful claims
upon them that are u&s;ing again&s;t your's."</P>
<P>"Claims! what claims?" cried he:
"who &s;hall dare to di&s;pute with me an heart
to which&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nay, nay," an&s;wered Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone,
"this is all phrenzy and wildne&s;s.
Do you not know that you have no claim,
though I am willing to allow all your me|rit;
and do you not &s;ee that Willoughby,
in being compelled to re&s;ign her, recom|mends
<PB N="101" REF="111">
his friend Vava&s;our to her favour,
and therefore &s;ends him hither."</P>
<P>"Vava&s;our!" cried he: "recommend
Vava&s;our to her! And would Cele&s;tina,
who, with all that dignified gentlene&s;s, has
a great deal of &s;pirit, with a proper con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of her own value; would &s;he
bear to be con&s;igned, like a bale of mer|chandi&s;e,
to a friend, and to &s;uch a man as
Vava&s;our? Impo&s;&s;ible! he dare not think
of it: but I wi&s;h he may, for her in&s;ulted
pride will mitigate the pain of her di&s;ap|pointed
love, and &s;he will be mine&mdash;the
charmer will be mine."</P>
<P>The look, the manner, in which this
was uttered, encrea&s;ed the concern of Mrs. Elphin&s;tone,
who, from her own recent
and &s;evere &s;ufferings, had learned to dread
any thing like romantic eccentricity. She
laid her &s;oft cold hand on the burning
hands of Montague Thorold, as they were
wildly cla&s;ped together&mdash;"My dear Sir,"
&s;aid &s;he, in the gentle&s;t accents, "I owe
you a thou&s;and obligations for all the atten|tion
<PB N="102" REF="112">
you &s;hewed me in my late calamitous
&s;ituation, and ill, very ill, &s;hould I repay
tho&s;e obligations, if I did not try as a
friend to mitigate the&s;e violent tran&s;ports.
Believe me, the heart of Cele&s;tina, fixed
in her early life to one object, is attached
to that object with more than common
firmne&s;s: Vava&s;our's frantic fondne&s;s, and
your real merit, will, in my opinion, be
equally indifferent to her; and I verily be|lieve,
that if Willoughby marries another,
as I conclude he will, Mi&s;s De Mornay
will never marry at all."</P>
<P>Montague Thorold could not bear this.
The idea of rivalry had been painful; but
the pain was mitigated by his knowledge
of her character and of the character of
Vava&s;our, which, with all its avowed li|bertini&s;m,
he knew Cele&s;tina could not
even tolerate, and certainly not approve:
but the idea of her living only for Wil|loughby,
even when Willoughby lived for
another, was in&s;upportable, and &s;ince he
was unwilling to own it was po&s;&s;ible, he
<PB N="103" REF="113">
would therefore have been ready to quarrel
with any body but Mrs. Elphin&s;tone for
&s;uppo&s;ing it probable: but to every being
who was unfortunate, and e&s;pecially if that
unfortunate being was a woman, the kind
heart of Montague Thorold overflowed
with good will and &s;ympathy: he there|fore
checked him&s;elf; and &s;aying he
&s;hould be impatient to hear of Mi&s;s De
Mornay in the morning, he wi&s;hed Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone a good night, and left her.</P>

<P>IT was not till after two or three read|ings,
with a palpitating heart&mdash;a heart &s;o
much agitated as hardly to leave her the
u&s;e of her rea&s;on, that Cele&s;tina perfectly
under&s;tood the meaning of Willoughby's
letter, which ran thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>The only apology, dear Cele&s;tina, that
the unhappy Willoughby has to offer for
his conduct is, to relate to you all that
has befallen him &s;ince that fatal night
when he parted from you at Alve&s;tone.
The emotions which I mu&s;t feel while I
write, I will endeavour to &s;uppre&s;s,
both for your &s;ake and my own; it &s;hall
be, if I can command my&s;elf, a hi&s;tory
<PB N="105" REF="115">
of events rather than of the &s;ufferings to
which tho&s;e events have condemned me.
You know, that after the abrupt and
unaccountable note that I received, I
ha&s;tened to the inn at Exeter, where
I was informed &s;ome per&s;ons, who had
bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t importance which
admitted not of a moment's delay,
waited to &s;ee me. The terms in which
the note was written were &s;uch as gave
me a &s;trange alarm, though I knew not
what to dread. This unea&s;y a&s;toni&s;h|ment
was not le&s;&s;ened, when, after much
appearance of my&s;tery, I was introduced
to&mdash;Lady Ca&s;tlenorth.</P>
<P>You know the woman, and can ima|gine
how ill her har&s;hne&s;s, when irritated
by the malignity of di&s;appointed pride,
was calculated to &s;often the blow which
it was her plea&s;ure to give me her&s;elf.
She told me, that having heard I was
on the following morning to become
your hu&s;band, &s;he felt it to be her duty
to &s;ave me from the horrors of &s;uch a
<PB N="106" REF="116">
union, by informing me that &s;he knew
you to be the daughter of my mother,
the daughter of that Mr. Everard who
was my tutor, and that the woman &s;he
had with her, who had been a &s;ervant
in the hou&s;e at the time, could give the
mo&s;t indi&s;putable account of your birth.</P>
<P>Stunned as by a &s;troke of thunder, I
turned towards the woman, of who&s;e
face as a &s;ervant of my mother's I had
not the lea&s;t recollection. I know not
what I &s;aid to her; I only remember
that &s;he gave, in a confu&s;ed and vulgar
way, an account of what &s;he pretended
to have been witne&s;s to. I &s;uffered her
to talk on, for my very &s;oul was &s;ink|ing
with angui&s;h. My mother's ho|nour
de&s;troyed! my Cele&s;tina torn from
me! My &s;oul recoiled from the idea as
from an execrable fal&s;hood. Yet when
I remembered the &s;olemn injunction
that beloved mother gave me in her
la&s;t moments to marry Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man,
the promi&s;e &s;he drew from me ne|ver
<PB N="107" REF="117">
otherwi&s;e to unite my&s;elf&mdash;when
my agonized mind ran back to the di&s;|plea&s;ure
&s;he &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed at my
fondne&s;s and admiration for you&mdash;I
dared not, with all the pain and all the
horror I felt, I dared not throw from me
with indignation this odious intelligence;
I dared not load the hateful communi|cators
of it with the odium which would
have been dictated by my &s;welling heart,
had it not been checked by the&s;e &s;ad
recollections, which pre&s;&s;ed upon me
in de&s;pite of my&s;elf, and gave me &s;ome|thing
like internal evidence of the facts
I would very fain have denied.</P>
<P>There was, in the countenance of
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, &s;omething of in&s;o|lent
triumph which I could not bear.
She made a merit of her di&s;intere&s;ted
conduct, and talked of virtue, and ho|nour,
and integrity, till I was blind and
deaf: &s;he then threw out &s;ome reflec|tions
on my mother's memory, which
rou&s;ed me from the torpor of amaze|ment
<PB N="108" REF="118">
and &s;orrow to re&s;entment; &s;he ut|tered
&s;ome malignant &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t
you, and I flew from her.</P>
<P>She had, however, completely exe|cuted
her purpo&s;e, if it was that of ren|dering
me the mo&s;t wretched of human
beings; and in quitting the hou&s;e,
which &s;he did &s;oon afterwards, had the
barbarous plea&s;ure of knowing that &s;he
had de&s;troyed my peace for &s;ome time&mdash;if
not for ever.</P>
<P>To return to you, Cele&s;tina, under
the doubts which di&s;tracted me was
impo&s;&s;ible. To become your hu&s;band&mdash;&s;o
lately the fonde&s;t, the fir&s;t wi&s;h of a
heart that doated upon you, was not
to be thought of, while ideas of &s;o much
horror obtruded them&s;elves on my mind:
yet to leave you without accounting for
my ab&s;ence, to leave you to all the tor|turing
&s;u&s;pen&s;e of vague conjectures, to
leave you to &s;uppo&s;e I had deceived
and for&s;aken you, was cruel, was un|pardonable:
it was, however, what,
<PB N="109" REF="119">
after a long and dreadful &s;truggle, I de|termined
to do. I might, indeed, have
put an end to your conjectures by deli|vering
you over to others more tor|menting&mdash;by
communicating the doubts
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had rai&s;ed; but this
I found I could le&s;s bear to do than
even to leave you wholly in &s;u&s;pen&s;e.
Believing her capable of any thing which
revenge or malice could dictate, there
was rea&s;on, notwith&s;tanding all my
trembling apprehen&s;ions, to &s;uppo&s;e it
more than po&s;&s;ible that &s;he might have
invented the &s;tory, and have bribed the
woman with her to give evidence of it's
truth. To this po&s;&s;ibility my mind
clung with the eagerne&s;s of a drowning
wretch; and I could not re&s;olve to &s;ully
before you the memory of my angel
mother, which I know you hold in &s;uch
tender veneration; I could not deter|mine
to rai&s;e in your delicate and &s;en&s;i|ble
mind doubts and terrors which
might make &s;uch fatal impre&s;&s;ions as
<PB N="110" REF="120">
might impede our union, even if the
fallacy of this invention to divide us
was detected. In a &s;tate of mind then
which I will not attempt to de&s;cribe, I
at length determined to &s;end for Cath|cart,
and without explaining even to
him the motives of my &s;udden journey,
to &s;ecure, if I could, your continuance
at Alve&s;tone, and to &s;et out my&s;elf to
di&s;cover the real circumstances of your
birth; and never to return till I had
the mo&s;t thorough convinction that you
were not the daughter of my mother, or
till I could learn to con&s;ider you, if it
were &s;o&mdash;only as a beloved &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Ah! Cele&s;tina! I little knew the ta&s;k
I undertook; yet with angui&s;h and de|pre&s;&s;ion,
to which no words can do ju&s;|tice,
I &s;et about it. My fir&s;t &s;tep was,
to find out Wat&s;on, my mother's old
&s;ervant, who had never, I knew, left
her for many years. I knew that after
her death, and on receiving the legacy
of fifty pounds that her mi&s;tre&s;s left her,
<PB N="111" REF="121">
&s;he had retired to the hou&s;e of her &s;on,
who was married and &s;ettled at White|haven.
I might have written to have
enquired after her; but then I mu&s;t
have waited &s;ome days in &s;u&s;pen&s;e I
could not bear; and while I was in mo|tion
I felt my mi&s;ery le&s;s, from an idea
that I was doing &s;omething to end it.
I &s;at out therefore on hor&s;eback for
Whitehaven, and on my arrival there
learned that &s;he had been dead about
&s;ix weeks. This fir&s;t hope of certainty
thus fru&s;trated, it occurred to me that
perhaps among her papers there might
be &s;ome memorandums that would be
u&s;eful; and as she always hired and di&s;|charged
the inferior &s;ervants, and kept
an account of the time and terms of their
&s;ervice in a book, I flattered my&s;elf that
I might find &s;ome date of the time
when Hannah Bi&s;coe, who pretended
to have been in her confidence and to
have been entru&s;ted with a &s;ecret of &s;uch
importance, really lived in the family.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="122">
I told her &s;on, that to &s;ee all the pa|pers
his mother had left, was of impor|tance
to me. He readily brought all
he had. There were &s;ome books of ac|counts,
and &s;ome memorandums about
&s;ervants, but none that gave me any
light, or were of any importance to my
enquiry, for none went back above ten
years. The man told me there were
more; but that not knowing they were
of any con&s;equence, or even &s;uppo&s;ing
them likely to be called for, he had
given them to his children, who had cut
them to pieces. "I believe, however,
Sir, &s;aid he, that there are &s;ome letters
in a drawer of a bureau, which I re|member
to have &s;een during my mo|ther's
illne&s;s: I will fetch them if you
think they will be of any &s;ervice."</P>
<P>I de&s;ired him to do &s;o, and he brought
me about twenty letters: &s;ome of them
were from my mother, while &s;he was in
London in the years 1779 and 1780,
and Wat&s;on was at Alve&s;tone with you
<PB N="113" REF="123">
and my &s;i&s;ter, of whom &s;he had, as you
well remember, the care on all occa&s;ions
where it was nece&s;&s;ary for my mother to
be ab&s;ent. You were then about nine,
and Matilda about eleven years old.
The only &s;entences of any kind of con|&s;equence
were the&s;e:</P>
<P>I have no notion of any real danger
from the landing of troops from the fleets
of France and Spain. No landing can
take place; and 'tis all non&s;en&s;e and bra|vado.
I thought you had more &s;en&s;e,
Wat&s;on, than to catch the panic of the
vulgar and the ignorant, which <HI>they</HI> ra|ther
like to communicate. However,
&s;ince you write &s;o pre&s;&s;ingly to know
what &s;hould be done if any thing &s;hould
happen, I give you an an&s;wer, fir&s;t, that
nothing will happen; and &s;econdly, if
you have any alarm, which a rea&s;onable
being would con&s;ider &s;uch, take <HI>my</HI> two
girls and bring them up hither in&s;tantly.
But I &s;hall be down at Alve&s;tone in about
<PB N="114" REF="124">
ten days, and nothing can happen within
that time believe me</P>
<P><HI>My two girls,</HI> was the only &s;entence in
this letter on which I could lay any
&s;tre&s;s. <HI>My</HI> two girls! Well, and what
then? have I not heard my mother a
thou&s;and times &s;ay, <HI>my</HI> two girls? <HI>My
Matilda, my Cele&s;tina,</HI> were names in|di&s;criminately
u&s;ed: my <HI>children;</HI> even
my <HI>daughters,</HI> were terms not unfre|quent
with her. Ah! little, little did
her generous and benevolent heart &s;up|po&s;e
that <HI>&s;uch</HI> advantage might be taken
of that genero&s;ity&mdash;of that benevolence;
for now&mdash;even now&mdash;no&mdash;I do not, I
cannot, I will not believe that Cele&s;tina
has any other claim to her friend&s;hip, to
her protection, than what aro&s;e from
that genero&s;ity and benevolence. Now,
do I &s;ay?&mdash;can I &s;ay it? Oh heaven!
how dreadfully contradictory are the &s;en|timents
that agitate and tear my heart!</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="125">
Let me, however, recall my &s;cattered
thoughts: and remember, that it is a
&s;imple hi&s;tory of facts only, and not of
feelings, that I promi&s;ed to relate.</P>
<P>Another letter was written to Wat&s;on,
when Mr. Everard, after a very tedious
illne&s;s, which had long confined him in
town, went down to Alve&s;tone in the
year eighty, for change of air, rather
than to his own par&s;onage, where &s;ome
repairs were then going on. This letter
was expre&s;&s;ive of great &s;olicitude and
anxiety: but from thence what could be
inferred? nothing but that the dear and
benevolent writer was &s;olicitous for the
health of a friend to whom &s;he had long
been attached. There was not in this a
word on which the mo&s;t invidious ob|&s;erver
could dwell; nor was there in
any other letter a &s;yllable to give me
any confirmation of what I dreaded to
find. Still I procured from the per&s;on
who had &s;ucceeded to Wat&s;on's effects,
every paper and every book that re|mained;
<PB N="116" REF="126">
but I found nothing; and re|turned
to London as mi&s;erable, as di&s;&s;a|tisfied
as I left it.</P>
<P>Nothing made me more wretched
than the que&s;tions with which I was now
per&s;ecuted. I fled from &s;ociety; &s;topped
at a &s;mall village in the neighbourhood
of London, where I avoided every body
who was likely to know me, and thought
only how I might &s;atisfy my own tor|turing
doubts, and e&s;cape tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t obvious method &s;eemed to
be, to find out the woman who had ac|companied
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, and que&s;|tion
her when &s;he was no longer under
the influence of her employer: but this
I could not do without getting, at my
uncle's hou&s;e, information which I
knew not how to &s;et about. To go
there, was hateful to me. I could not
now bear the &s;ight of people whom I
had never loved, and to whom I imputed
all the mi&s;ery I laboured under.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="127">
My &s;ervant Farnham had been little
u&s;ed to tho&s;e &s;ort of negociations, and
knew not much better than I did, how
to ingratiate him&s;elf into the favour of
the per&s;ons, through who&s;e means only
he could procure the intelligence &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to us. He went, however, about
it as well as he could; but all I learned
was, that Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had, &s;oon
after her journey into Devon&s;hire, &s;ent
the woman who accompanied her away
into her native country, which was ei|ther
Norfolk or Suffolk, and with &s;o
much &s;ecrecy that nobody knew whi|ther
&s;he was gone, or how &s;he was pro|vided
for: but Farnham with &s;ome diffi|culty
drew from the re&s;t of the &s;ervants,
with whom he found means of conver&s;|ing,
that &s;he had boa&s;ted, in &s;ome mo|ments
of vulgar exultation, that her
fortune was made for ever.</P>
<P>No clue, however, could I obtain by
which I could find out this woman; and
after much fruitle&s;s enquiry, where the
<PB N="118" REF="128">
art of the adver&s;ary with whom I had
to engage baffled all my a&s;&s;iduity, I de|termined
to go to Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, to
&s;tate to him the &s;tigma that his wife had
thrown on the honour of my mother,
his &s;i&s;ter, and to demand that I might
have proofs of the facts &s;he alledged,
&s;uch as &s;he could now give, or that &s;he
might acknowledge the wickedne&s;s and
inju&s;tice of her a&s;per&s;ions.</P>
<P>I was not aware, till I conver&s;ed with
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth, to how debilitated a
&s;tate indolence, ignorance, pride, and
prejudice, can reduce the human mind.
His, however, was of &s;o &s;ingular a ca&s;t,
that in&s;tead of being &s;hocked at the in|jury
done to his &s;i&s;ter's honour, he af|fected
to re&s;ent, in &s;pite of his family
pride, my doubts of his wife's veracity,
flew from the point to which I attempted
to bring him, and we parted in mutual
di&s;gu&s;t: at lea&s;t I was di&s;gu&s;ted, and
more wretched and more hopele&s;s than
before I had made this attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="129">
Every effort to di&s;cover the retreat of
the woman failing, my next mea&s;ure
was to go to the convent at Hieres. It
was owing to the&s;e cruel circum&s;tances,
Cele&s;tina, that I left you in doubt while
I remained in England; it was owing
to the&s;e, that I left England in the
hope&mdash;though it became every day more
mingled with apprehen&s;ion&mdash;that I left
England without accounting to you for
my conduct. Were the&s;e &s;urmi&s;es
groundle&s;s, why &s;hould I empoi&s;on your
delicate mind? why &s;hould I &s;ully for
a moment the &s;acred fame of my mo|ther
by divulging them? were they
found to be at length too well &s;ub&s;tan|tiated,
it would be then time enough to
inform you of them.</P>
<P>On my arrival at Hieres, I went di|rectly
to the pre&s;ent Confe&s;&s;or of the
community out of who&s;e care my mo|ther
took you. I found him to be intel|ligent,
obliging, and officious. From
him I learned, that the pre&s;ent Superior
<PB N="120" REF="130">
was a young woman of good family,
who had been compelled to take the veil,
and who would probably have very few
real &s;cruples as to giving me all the in|formation
&s;he could.</P>
<P>I &s;ucceeded ea&s;ily in my re&s;earch, as
far as it depended on the&s;e two per&s;ons.
I found that the memorandum of my
mother's having taken you out of the
convent, by the name of Cele&s;tina de
Mornay, remained; and I found, with
emotions on which I mu&s;t not dwell,
that there was another memorandum of
expences, for the little <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> child,
received at the reque&s;t of Madame de
P&mdash;. Such is the literal &s;en&s;e of the
French words. Who then was this
Madame de P&mdash;? An old nun, who
had lived in the hou&s;e above five and
twenty years, and who was the only
per&s;on who recollected any circum&s;tan|ces
of your reception, told me that &s;he
well remembered that this Madame de
P&mdash;came from Bayonne, or &s;ome
<PB N="121" REF="131">
part of the country in the neighbour|hood
of that town; and that &s;he was an
intimate friend of the then Abbe&s;s, and
her name, of which only the initials
were expre&s;&s;ed in the memorandum,
was le Marqui&s;e de Pellatier.</P>
<P>I enquired of the old nun, if &s;he
knew on what ground it was you were
repre&s;ented as an Engli&s;h child? &s;he
replied, that &s;he knew no more than
that when fir&s;t you were received under
the care of the Superior, you were &s;aid
to be the child of Engli&s;h parents, or at
lea&s;t that one of your parents was of that
nation: but that &s;oon afterwards this
was, by the Abbe&s;s's authority, contra|dicted;
it was forbidden to be men|tioned
in the community; and it was
ordered that you &s;hould from that time
be &s;poken of as Mademoi&s;elle de Mor|nay;
while intimations were given that
you were a relation of her own; born of
a concealed marriage; and that your
father being dead, and your mother
<PB N="122" REF="132">
married to another per&s;on, you were to
be con&s;idered as belonging only to the
community in which you were de&s;tined
to pa&s;s your life.</P>
<P>Ah! Cele&s;tina! what food was here
for tho&s;e corro&s;ive conjectures which
preyed on my heart. Having exhau&s;ted
however, every kind of information
which it was here po&s;&s;ible to procure, I
&s;et out for Bayonne; where &s;ome of the
family at lea&s;t of Madame de Pellatier
were, I under&s;tood, to be found.</P>
<P>She had her&s;elf been dead &s;ome years.
I met, however, with her &s;on, a gay
young man of four or five and twenty,
from whom I could obtain nothing but
a general confe&s;&s;ion that his mother
probably had, from the general tenor of
her life, occa&s;ion in more than one in|&s;tance
to exerci&s;e the &s;ecrecy and kind
offices of her friends, and very probably
obliged them in her turn: and when I
explained to him my rea&s;ons for the
anxious enquiries I made, which I
<PB N="123" REF="133">
thought the only means likely to intere&s;t
him for me, he &s;aid that he was "<HI>vrai|ment
au de&s;e&s;poir</HI>" at the little <HI>embarras</HI>
into which I had fallen: that la belle
demoi&s;elle might be my &s;i&s;ter or might
be his; that he had not the lea&s;t hope
of being of &s;ervice to me in unravelling
the my&s;tery, for he had de&s;troyed all
his mother's papers in pur&s;uance of her
dying directions &s;ome years before, and
did not believe the &s;lighte&s;t trace re|mained
of any connection with an En|gli&s;h
lady, or an Engli&s;h family. I en|quired
where his mother lived in the
years 1770 and 1771, which was about
the time of your birth, and where in the
year 1772, the time of your reception in
the convent; he replied that &s;he was
then &s;ometimes at Paris, where &s;he was
believed to have an arrangement with
Count W&mdash;, a German nobleman,
&s;ometimes at Pezenas and &s;ometimes
at Hieres. From all this I could gather
nothing to my purpo&s;e; and Mon&s;ieur
<PB N="124" REF="134">
de Pellatier &s;oon quitting his hou&s;e in
the neighbourhood of Bayonne to go to
Paris, I returned thither al&s;o, infinitely
more unhappy than before my re&s;earch.</P>
<P>All I have related, Cele&s;tina, is &s;o lit|tle
convincing when it is put together,
that perhaps I ought not to lay any &s;tre&s;s
upon it, when to &s;uch &s;light and un&s;atis|factory
ground of conjecture, is oppo&s;ed
the character and the principles of my
mother: yet &s;hall I tell you truly, that
the energy with which &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me
with her la&s;t words to marry Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman;
the di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he always
&s;hewed at my expre&s;&s;ing any partiality
towards you; her grief at the death of
Mr. Everard, which it was ea&s;y to &s;ee
&s;he never recovered; &s;ome words which,
though I could not clearly under&s;tand
them, e&s;caped her lips almo&s;t with her
la&s;t &s;igh, and in which the name of Ce|le&s;tina
&s;eemed united with &s;ome ardent
prayer, or &s;ome earne&s;t injunction,
while, in her cold convul&s;ed hand, &s;he
<PB N="125" REF="135">
pre&s;&s;ed mine to her trembling lips; oh!
Cele&s;tina! tho&s;e &s;ounds I have &s;ince in|terpreted
into a confe&s;&s;ion of this fatal
&s;ecret. Still, &s;till inarticulate as they
were, they vibrate on my heart: and
now, united with the &s;tory of Lady Ca&s;|tlenorth,
and the circum&s;tances I have
gathered of your being born of Engli&s;h
parents&mdash;all, all unite to render me
wretched.</P>
<P>Yet there is not the lea&s;t likene&s;s be|tween
you and my mother; there is not
the remote&s;t re&s;emblance between you
and Mr. Everard, who had remarkably
&s;trong features and very red hair: oh!
Cele&s;tina! what am I to conjecture?
what am I to do? can I, ought I, on
&s;uch grounds, to re&s;ign you? Can I ever
learn to con&s;ider you only as my &s;i&s;ter?
Where &s;hall I go next? how &s;atisfy my
doubts? how ever po&s;&s;e&s;s again a mo|ment's
happine&s;s? Every other evil is light to this. Even
the di&s;order of my affairs, the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="126" REF="136">
I &s;hall &s;oon be in to &s;ell Alve&s;tone, is
hardly felt. On my leaving England,
I rai&s;ed money at an enormous premium
in order to pay Vava&s;our what I could
not bear to owe him, uncertain as I was
what would become of me. This, to|gether
with my ab&s;ence; has alarmed
&s;ome of my mortgagees, who talk of
foreclo&s;ing their mortgages; while my
own neglect of my affairs has, in de&s;pite
of Cathcart's a&s;&s;iduity, contributed to
my embarra&s;&s;ments. But what are the&s;e
inferior di&s;tre&s;&s;es, compared to the
wretchedne&s;s of a heart, adoring Cele&s;|tina
yet afraid of indulging his pa&s;&s;ion
le&s;t it lead him into guilt? Ah! every
evil fortune could inflict but this, I could
bear.</P>
<P>But again it is nece&s;&s;ary to recall my
pen from the de&s;cription of feelings to the
narrative of facts.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady Ca&s;tlenorth and their
daughetr arrived in the early part of the
&s;ummer in France. I was then ab&s;ent
<PB N="127" REF="137">
on the re&s;earch I have related to you,
but heard they had been very earne&s;t in
their enquiries after me at Paris; and on
my return thither, &s;ome months after|wards,
I received a letter from Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth, earne&s;tly de&s;iring me to
join them at Florence or Naples. The
letter imported that the alliance he once
wi&s;hed was no longer in que&s;tion; but
that finding his health every day de|clining,
he wi&s;hed to &s;ee the only male
relation he had, on the &s;ettlement of
&s;ome family concerns.</P>
<P>This invitation I ought not perhaps
on other accounts to have refu&s;ed; but
the hope of being able to gain &s;ome far|ther
intelligence of the circum&s;tances
which occupied my mind ince&s;&s;antly,
determined me at once to accept it.
I went then, and met them at Florence,
where my uncle received me with as
much overacted civility, as when we
parted la&s;t he had treated me with &s;uper|cilious
&s;corn.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="138">
I found him, however, not more rea|&s;onable
than before : the prejudices that
had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind were &s;o
&s;trong that he was angry and amazed
that what made the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of
his life could be to any other per&s;on
matters of mere indifference. He talked
to me ince&s;&s;antly of remedies for the
gout, of the medicines he was taking,
and of their effects; told me how he
&s;lept and how he eat; and read di&s;&s;er|tations
without end on chronic di&s;orders
in general; and from this di&s;cour&s;e he
glided by &s;ome link which e&s;caped
me, into his other favourite &s;cience, he|raldry.
Oh! the quarterings and bear|ings
which I was compelled to affect
hearing; the genealogies I was di&s;|tracted
with; and the marriages and in|termarriages
to which I appeared to li&s;ten,
while in fact I knew nothing of what he
&s;aid, and only endured this &s;ort of mar|tyrdom
in the hope of &s;eeing Lady Ca&s;|tlenorth,
<PB N="129" REF="139">
who on my fir&s;t vi&s;its did not
deign to appear.</P>
<P>All the&s;e latter harangues were, I
found, intended to impre&s;s on my mind
the pride and prudence which would at|tend
a union with my cou&s;in, his daugh|ter,
and the advantage it would give me
above any other alliance I could form.
My patient acquie&s;cence was imputed to
returning inclination for this boa&s;ted
connection; and when I was thought to
be &s;ufficiently impre&s;&s;ed with the ideas
thus meant to be conveyed to me, and
to be weaned from the weakne&s;s I had
betrayed, I was admitted, without any
&s;olicitation however on my part, to the
honour of &s;eeing Lady Ca&s;tlenorth and
her daughter.</P>
<P>The elder lady was the only one of
them with whom I wi&s;hed to have any
conver&s;ation, and her love of hearing
her&s;elf talk obtained me this favour, in
&s;pite of all the di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he had con|ceived
again&s;t me: but it was very dif|ficult
<PB N="130" REF="140">
to bring her to conver&s;e on that
&s;ubject which alone intere&s;ted me: &s;he
would talk politics, or give me a di&s;&s;er|tation
on the nature of the &s;oul, or on
the eruptions of Ve&s;uvius, de&s;cant on
the age of the world, or on her <HI>own</HI>
age,(if her auditors would allow her to
be not quite five and forty:) but of Ce|le&s;tina
&s;he would <HI>not</HI> talk; and if ever I,
in &s;pite of her eva&s;ions, introduced the
conver&s;ation, &s;he affected to hear me
with horror, and to con&s;ider every men|tion
I made of a per&s;on whom &s;he called
&s;o connected with me, as the mo&s;t inde|licate
and improper conver&s;ation with
which I could entertain her. She was
for the mo&s;t part &s;urrounded, when I
was admitted to her, with abbati, and
the oracle of a circle &s;he had her&s;elf
formed, in which it was generally im|practicable
to entertain her with any
other conver&s;ation than that &s;he cho&s;e to
lead to.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="141">
Her daughter, who had formerly re|ceived
me with &s;o much haughtine&s;s,
and who had &s;ince been offended in the
tendere&s;t point, a point too in which
her extreme vanity had rendered her
particularly &s;u&s;ceptible, affected no
longer the overweening pride which in
our fir&s;t interviews had been &s;o repul|&s;ive,
but a &s;oft melancholy, which &s;its
well enough on &s;ome people, but was
in her more likely to move mirth than
pity: &s;he &s;eldom &s;poke to me; but when
&s;he did, it was with the air of one who&s;e
ju&s;t indignation was conquered by
&s;ofter &s;entiments. I knew I never could
de&s;erve tho&s;e &s;entiments from her, and
therefore was very &s;orry to &s;ee them, even
though certain they were feigned.</P>
<P>But it was here only I could hope to
gain any information of the woman,
Hannah Bi&s;coe, who pretended to have
lived with my mother near twenty years
&s;ince. Lady Ca&s;tlenorth evaded, with
wonderful art, ever giving me any trace
<PB N="132" REF="142">
of this circum&s;tance, and of her daugh|ter
I knew it was in vain to enquire;
but there was a little &s;mart Italian girl,
called Ju&s;tina, who had attended on
Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman for &s;ome time, and
who had been in England with her, and
I took occa&s;ion, as often as I could &s;ee
her, to &s;ay &s;ome obliging thing to her,
and &s;ometimes to make her a trifling
pre&s;ent. Ju&s;tina, in con&s;equence of my
taking &s;o much notice of her, began
officiou&s;ly to put her&s;elf in my way;
and I believe her vanity prompted her
for &s;ome time to &s;uppo&s;e I had very differ|ent
motives for my attention than tho&s;e
with which I was really actuated.</P>
<P>But in a foreign woman of that rank
even vanity u&s;ually yields to avarice.
When I had obtained an opportunity of
clearly explaining my&s;elf, Ju&s;tina un|dertook
to procure me a direction to the
woman whom I was &s;o &s;olicitous to
find. She produced it in about a week,
but artfully evaded my que&s;tion as to
<PB N="133" REF="143">
how &s;he came by it. I &s;ent off my own
&s;ervant in&s;tantly with it, determined to
follow him my&s;elf if the information as
to her place of abode proved to be true.
I received an account from him that a
few days before his arrival at the hou&s;e
in Suffolk, where &s;he was &s;aid to live,
&s;he had removed from thence, and the
people either did not know or would
not tell whither &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed &s;o like an artifice of
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth's to prevent my mak|ing
the enquiry which &s;he knew I had
&s;o long and &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that I
could now no longer doubt but that
Ju&s;tina had betrayed me: but during
this di&s;quieting &s;u&s;pen&s;e time wore away,
and you, Cele&s;tina&mdash;what did you, what
could you think of me?</P>
<P>I entertained the &s;tronge&s;t hopes, that
&s;ince Lady Ca&s;tlenorth &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly
kept me from the per&s;on &s;he had her&s;elf
produced as likely to give me authentic
and indi&s;putable te&s;timony, that &s;he knew
<PB N="143" REF="144">
her evidence would not bear inve&s;tiga|tion,
and to this hope I eagerly adhered.
My mind, however, was too much irri|tated
by the idea of &s;uch complicated
treachery to allow me to keep terms
with her as I had hitherto done: I was
wandering about Italy all the time of
Farnham's ab&s;ence: on his rejoining me,
I went back to the re&s;idence of Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth, and very peremptorily
taxed his wife with fraud. I denied
that Hannah Bi&s;coe lived with my mo|ther
at the period &s;he pretended to have
done &s;o; and that lea&s;t I &s;hould di&s;co|ver
the deception, that &s;he had been
&s;ent away from the place where I had
with difficulty di&s;covered her.</P>
<P>Lady Ca&s;tlenorth affected the calm
indifference of injured innocence, the
proud con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of ill treated inte|grity;
&s;he affected to declare that &s;he
was de&s;irous of my &s;eeing this Hannah
Bi&s;coe, that &s;he knew not of her depar|ture
from the place whither &s;he went,
<PB N="135" REF="145">
which was the hou&s;e of a brother in law,
nor was in any way concerned about her;
"but," added &s;he, ri&s;ing and going to a
cabinet where &s;he kept papers; "you
&s;hall pre&s;ently be convinced that &s;he did
live with your mother in the year 1770."</P>
<P>She took out a letter, which I &s;aw
immediately to be my mother's hand.
It was directed to Hannah Bi&s;coe at
Mrs. Willoughby's, South Audley-&s;treet,
where my mother's town hou&s;e then
was. The&s;e were the words:</P>

</LETTER>
<PB N="136" REF="146">
<P>I returned the letter to Lady Ca&s;tle|north,
and expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf very warmly;
in&s;i&s;ting upon it that from &s;uch evidence
nothing could be derived or even
gue&s;&s;ed at: but &s;he bade me, with a
contemptuous &s;mile, remember, that
when I que&s;tioned this woman at Exe|ter
&s;he had told me, that you were for
the fir&s;t months of your life nur&s;ed at
Ken&s;ington, whither &s;he went almo&s;t
every day to &s;ee you, and that at five
or &s;ix months old you were &s;ent abroad;
and when my mother went to the South
of France, on pretence of recovering
her health, eighteen or twenty months
after the death of my father, you were
conveyed thither, and there put under
the care of a friend, who placed you
&s;oon after with the Superior of the con|vent
of St. Cele&s;tine, at Hieres, as a rela|tion
of her own.</P>
<P>The coincidence of this &s;tory, with
what I had heard before relative to Ma|dame
Pellatier, &s;truck me with more force
<PB N="137" REF="147">
than any thing I had yet learned. I
left the hou&s;e of Lord Ca&s;tlenorth more
mi&s;erable than I had ever been before,
and again &s;et out for Provence, hardly
knowing why, and not caring at all
what became of me.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince that period, Cele&s;tina, I
have been wandering from place to place
in &s;earch of information which I cannot
obtain, and, which obtained, would cer|tainly
render me wretched, if indeed
any wretchedne&s;s can be greater than
that which in my pre&s;ent &s;tate of mi|&s;erable
uncertainty it is my lot to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Are we then, Cele&s;tina, are we related
by blood? and is there an invincible
bar between us? Was my mother, that
admirable, that excellent, and almo&s;t
faultle&s;s woman, capable of living in a
&s;tate of continual di&s;&s;imulation as to
you, and of hiding one fault by another,
which might have been followed by con|&s;equences
&s;o hideous to my imagina|tion?
Oh! Cele&s;tina, it &s;eems &s;acrilege
<PB N="138" REF="148">
to her memory to think it: yet her
aver&s;ion to my expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s
towards you, her conduct in a hundred
in&s;tances I can recollect, her &s;trong in|junctions,
the promi&s;e &s;he extorted from
me to marry Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman&mdash;a pro|mi&s;e
urged with &s;uch vehemence, even
in her la&s;t moments! Could the poor
con&s;ideration of pecuniary advantage in|fluence
her then? did it ever influence
her? And the repetition of your name
with her la&s;t breath, mingled with words
that might be a prayer for you, but
which I have &s;ince thought was po&s;&s;ibly
the fatal &s;ecret which &s;he determined to
divulge only in death. The &s;ad recol|lection
of that &s;cene, her countenance,
which I continually behold, her voice,
which murmurs &s;till in my ears, all, all
contribute to empoi&s;on every moment
of my life, and to make that tender af|fection,
that ardent love, which was
once the joy of my exi&s;tence and the
<PB N="139" REF="149">
pride of my heart, the &s;evere&s;t cur&s;e
with which heaven can pur&s;ue me.</P>
<P>Yes, Cele&s;tina, unle&s;s I dared in|dulge
that fondne&s;s with which my
heart overflows, I would I could forget
you for ever, and determine never to &s;ee
you more, for I de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing
you as I&mdash;Pardon me, I am lo&s;t in
the confu&s;ion of &s;en&s;ations I cannot de|&s;cribe;
and at this moment I hope &s;o
mi&s;erable a being does not exi&s;t on this
earth. Write to me, Cele&s;tina: you
have more &s;trength of mind than I have;
you are not, like me, the &s;port of ago|nizing
pa&s;&s;ions. Write to me; tell me
what you would have me do farther to
unveil this &s;ad my&s;tery, or to throw it
from us for ever, if that may be. I
have told Vava&s;our what it appeared
impo&s;&s;ible longer to conceal from him:
he is warmly my friend, and you may
employ him in any way in which you
think he can be u&s;eful. Cele&s;tina, I com|mit
you to his protection! till&mdash;till
<PB N="140" REF="150">
when, heaven only knows; and I dare
not tru&s;t my pen with another word;
only I entreat you to write to me; and

</LETTER>
<P>Thus ended this long letter, and thus
was explained the &s;trange circum&s;tances
that had co&s;t Cele&s;tina &s;o many tears. But
&s;he wept not now: &s;he read the letter over
twice: her fir&s;t tremulous emotion &s;ub|&s;ided;
but her &s;tunned &s;en&s;es had not re|covered
their tone. It was late; it was
cold; her candle had burnt nearly out.
She put the letter on her pillow; and un|able
to undre&s;s her&s;elf, threw her&s;elf on the
bed in her cloaths, and lay pondering on
what &s;he had read, on Willoughby's &s;itua|tion
and her own, till the tedious night was at an end.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>VAVASOUR, who had pa&s;&s;ed great
part of <HI>his</HI> night over a bottle, was not,
however, at all more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;leep to|wards
morning than if he had been in bed,
but at half after &s;even o'clock he &s;ent the
hou&s;emaid to know if Mi&s;s De Mornay
was up, and, if &s;he was, directed the &s;er|vant
to give his compliments to her, and
let her know that he &s;hould take it as a fa|vour
if &s;he would allow him to &s;peak to her
for a few moments before her other friends
were a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina had but ju&s;t fallen into an un|quiet
&s;lumber, when &s;he was awakened by
the maid who tapped at the door, from an
unea&s;y dream indeed, but from a change
of unea&s;ine&s;s. With her returning me|mory,
<PB N="142" REF="152">
all the purport of Willoughby's let|ter
returned; and Vava&s;our's me&s;&s;age added
mo&s;t painfully, the recollection that &s;he
mu&s;t di&s;cu&s;s it all with him.</P>
<P>She ordered him to be told, that &s;he was
not very well, and could not immediately
attend him: then &s;haking off the heavy
la&s;&s;itude which unea&s;ine&s;s and want of re&s;t
had occa&s;ioned, &s;he called to her aid all
that &s;trength of mind and rectitude of heart
with which &s;he was eminently endowed by
nature; and having again read over Wil|loughby's
letter, began to con&s;ider what &s;he
ought to do.</P>
<P>With a doubt of &s;uch a nature on his
mind, &s;he re&s;olved, whatever it co&s;t her,
never to meet him but as his &s;i&s;ter; unle&s;s,
which was very improbable, the &s;trong and
bewildering circum&s;tances which had given
ri&s;e to &s;uch an idea could all be removed.
With &s;o much purity did &s;he love him,
that &s;he felt, that were he happy with ano|ther,
and his e&s;teem and tenderne&s;s for her
undimini&s;hed, &s;he could be content through
<PB N="143" REF="153">
life to find her felicity in witne&s;&s;ing his.
She re&s;olved, therefore, after much debate
with her&s;elf and &s;ome pangs of unavoidable
regret, that &s;ince this dark and unpa&s;&s;able
barrier was rai&s;ed, either by nature or by
artifice, between her and the only man &s;he
had ever thought of with fond partiality,
&s;he would never marry, but would leave
him at full liberty to compleat that union
with Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, which might at
once fulfil his engagement to his mother,
wean him from that lingering fondne&s;s
for her which it was folly if not guilt to
indulge, and retrieve his pecuniary con|cerns
from tho&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments which were
now ha&s;tening to overwhelm him.</P>
<P>Having formed this heroic and proper
determination, &s;he endeavoured to com|po&s;e
her countenance, to quiet the agita|tion
of her mind, and to meet Vava&s;our
with that degree of calm &s;pirit which &s;he
imagined, from pa&s;t experience of his be|haviour,
&s;uch a meeting would require.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="154">
This, however, was ea&s;ier to imagine
than to execute. She wi&s;hed indeed to
meet him without witne&s;&s;es, becau&s;e &s;he
knew he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too little of that delicacy
which would teach him, to repre&s;s any
part of his knowledge before &s;trangers, as
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone and Montague Thorold
were to him: but when &s;he opened the
door of the room where &s;he knew he waited
for her, the blood for&s;ook her cheeks, her
trembling hands refu&s;ed the little exertion
nece&s;&s;ary to turn the lock, her feet refu&s;ed
to carry her forward, and &s;he would have
returned without &s;peaking to him for that
time, if he, who was eagerly waiting her
approach, had not heard her light foot &s;teps
in the pa&s;&s;age, and opened the door while
&s;he yet &s;tood he&s;itating at it.</P>
<P>He was &s;truck by the fight of her &s;wollen
and heavy eyes, the languor of her air, and
the palene&s;s of her countenance; and his
u&s;ual addre&s;s, which had more of warmth
and vivacity than elegance, was &s;oftened
by the real concern of which he was at that
<PB N="145" REF="155">
moment &s;en&s;ible. He took her hand,
which trembled within his as he led her to
a feat&mdash;"I am &s;orry," &s;aid he, "to &s;ee that
you are not well."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina tried to &s;peak, but could not.
Vava&s;our had but an indifferent notion of
admini&s;tering con&s;olation, nor could he
contrive to condole with her for what he
&s;ecretly rejoiced at him&s;elf; &s;o that be|tween
his di&s;&s;embled concern and his un|di&s;&s;embled
&s;atisfaction, he &s;at a moment or
two &s;ilent; and then remarked, that the
letter he had brought gave a very good ac|count
of George's health.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, without having any very pre|ci&s;e
idea of what &s;he &s;aid, an&s;wered faintly,
yes; and by this time Vava&s;our added,
that it contained al&s;o, he &s;uppo&s;ed, like what
he had at the &s;ametime received, the hi&s;tory
of a devili&s;h awkward, my&s;terious bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who found her&s;elf unequal to
the conver&s;ation, thought it better to put
an end to it at once and for ever. She
therefore, by an effort of re&s;olution, com|manded
<PB N="146" REF="156">
voice enough to &s;ay&mdash;"Mr. Vava|&s;our,
you under&s;tand undoubtedly that
every idea of the alliance between your
friend and me, is at an end for ever. As
for the rea&s;ons that exi&s;t again&s;t it, a thou|&s;and
motives make me wi&s;h they may re|main
&s;ecret; from this moment, therefore,
you will very much oblige me, by forbear|ing
to &s;peak of Mr. Willoughby otherwi&s;e
than as my be&s;t friend, and by concealing
from the world a &s;ecret, in which it can
have no intere&s;t, but which will give pain
to many to have divulged."</P>
<P>"Divulged!" cried he, laughing:
"what then do you &s;uppo&s;e it is any &s;e|cret?"</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure I do," &s;he replied.</P>
<P>"Oh! yes," an&s;wered he, "that is
mighty likely, when Lady Ca&s;tlenorth has
taken &s;uch pains to talk of it every where
already."</P>
<P>"Lady Ca&s;tlenorth!" cried Cele&s;tina;
a faint blu&s;h ri&s;ing in her pale cheek.</P>
<P>"Aye, to be &s;ure," &s;aid Vava&s;our care|le&s;sly,
"that &s;he did months ago. Why
<PB N="147" REF="157">
don't you know, that be&s;ides the intere&s;t &s;he
had in dividing you and Willoughby, be|cau&s;e
her daughter is in love with him it
&s;eems, &s;he always hated his mother; and
that death it&s;elf is no barrier again&s;t ma|lice
like her's."</P>
<P>"Do you think it probable or po&s;&s;ible
that this &s;tory may be entirely the effect of
that malice."</P>
<P>"Why faith no. I own I do not. You
know&mdash;at lea&s;t people tell me &s;o who
do know, that it was whi&s;pered about a
great many years ago, and even &s;aid, that
Everard was privately married to Mrs.
Willoughby. But what &s;ignifies talking
about it," added he, "&s;eeing her again
change colour&mdash;"You have ju&s;t been de|&s;iring
me to &s;ay nothing about it. George
&s;eems to me to have made up his mind
about it: he will marry his cou&s;in, and re|trieve
his e&s;tates, as was his fir&s;t plan; and
my fair Cele&s;tina" (and he took her hand)
"will look out for &s;omebody el&s;e to trans|fer
tho&s;e affections to that he re&s;igns."</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="158">
"No, Sir," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, withdrawing
her hand ha&s;tily from him, "they are not,
I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;o ea&s;ily transferred."</P>
<P>"I am glad to hear it," replied Vava|&s;our,
without being at all di&s;compo&s;ed by
her manner; "for then I hope this pe|dantic
young fellow, whom I find here
travelling with you, will not have the pre|&s;umption
to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>he</HI> has any chance of
obtaining them? Pray tell me&mdash;how
comes he here with you? is he any rela|tion
of the people you are with?"</P>
<P>This was a que&s;tion it was impo&s;&s;ible for
Cele&s;tina to an&s;wer ingenuou&s;ly. The
piercing and enquiring eyes of Vava&s;our,
inflamed and fierce from the late hours and
free u&s;e of wine the preceding night, were
fixed on her face. She changed counte|nance;
felt that &s;he did, and again her
complexion altered. The various emo|tions
with which &s;he was agitated, con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
that &s;he mu&s;t no longer think of
Willoughby as a lover, yet could never
admit another to that di&s;tinction, con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="149" REF="159">
too that Montague Thorold mu&s;t ap|pear
in the eyes of the world to have &s;uc|ceeded
to that place, and anger that Vava|&s;our
&s;hould thus pre&s;ume on the confidence
of Willoughby to que&s;tion her with a free|dom
he had otherwi&s;e no preten&s;ions to, all
combined to affect, to di&s;tre&s;s, and to de|prive
her for a few moments of that pre|&s;ence
of mind, which, from the &s;trength
and clearne&s;s of her under&s;tanding, was
u&s;ually at her command.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, who, from the time he found
Willoughby mu&s;t in all probability re&s;ign
her, made no doubt of &s;ucceeding to her
affections; who had no idea of the &s;en&s;a|tions
which pre&s;&s;ed on her heart, from his
total inability to feel them him&s;elf; be|came
irritated and impatient at the &s;ilence
his own impetuo&s;ity had occa&s;ioned. He
&s;at eagerly reading on her countenance the
emotions of her heart, and interpreting
them his own way: again he repeated his
que&s;tion&mdash;"How came young Thorold
<PB N="150" REF="160">
with you? Is he related to the&s;e Elphin|&s;tone's?"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t enquire of him," Cele&s;tina
was on the point of &s;aying; but the fear
lea&s;t a quarrel between them &s;hould be the
con&s;equence of her &s;o an&s;wering, checked
her. She tried, therefore, to evade the
que&s;tion. "Of what concern is it," &s;aid
&s;he, "<HI>how</HI> he came hither. We were
talking of Mr. Willoughby. Pray tell
me&mdash;is he aware that our &s;uppo&s;ed relation|&s;hip
is talked of? Does he know the pains
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth has been at to circulate
the &s;tory?"</P>
<P>"'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to know that,"
&s;aid Vava&s;our, (as it really was;) "it is
much more in your way to tell me, how
this college boy came hither with you."</P>
<P>"I know no right you have to enquire
about it," an&s;wered Cele&s;tina faintly, "be|cau&s;e
I cannot &s;ee that it is a concern in
which you are at all intere&s;ted."</P>
<P>"You will give me leave then to make
my own conclu&s;ions; or rather," added he,
<PB N="151" REF="161">
in a louder voice, on &s;eeing Montague
Thorold enter the room, "rather to inter|rogate
the gentleman him&s;elf."</P>
<P>This was exactly what Cele&s;tina had been
mo&s;t &s;olicitous to avoid; the impetuo&s;ity
of Vava&s;our, the &s;urprize and anger &s;he
&s;aw fla&s;hing from the eyes of Thorold, her
&s;leeple&s;s night and long agitated &s;pirits,
the fear of &s;he knew not what con&s;equences
from the&s;e two inflammable &s;pirits, and her
inability to check or repre&s;s tho&s;e over
whom &s;he had no pretence to a&s;&s;ume any
authority, were together a combination of
cruel circum&s;tances which might have
overcome a &s;tronger mind than her's.
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone was dejected from &s;itua|tion,
and languid from recent &s;orrow of her
own: to her, therefore, Cele&s;tina would in
any ca&s;e reluctantly have applied; and now
&s;he could not leave the room to &s;eek her
without leaving together two men who
&s;eemed &s;o highly irritated again&s;t each
other that the fir&s;t moment of her ab&s;ence
would probably bring them to extremities.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="162">
To &s;peak to Vava&s;our, was to addre&s;s
the winds or the &s;ea: &s;he &s;aw that he was
hardly &s;ober, that he was incapable of feel|ing
for her di&s;tre&s;s, or of li&s;tening to any
thing but his pa&s;&s;ionate impetuo&s;ity: it was
on Thorold alone &s;he had any hopes of
prevailing; but in the moment of her de|liberation
this hope &s;eemed e&s;caping her.</P>
<P>Before &s;he could determine on what to
do, Vava&s;our had, in a manner at once
contemptuous and ha&s;ty, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
to Montague Thorold, and enquired how
it happened that he was at York attending
on Mrs. Elphin&s;tone and Mi&s;s De Mornay?</P>
<P>"How it happens, Sir?" &s;aid Thorold.
"Is there then any thing &s;o very extraor|dinary
in it? May I not be at York or at
Canterbury?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Vava&s;our, "when you
are Archbi&s;hop of either; and then you will
be, for aught I know, in your right place;
but at pre&s;ent I think you in the wrong
one."</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="163">
"What <HI>you</HI> think, Sir," replied Tho|rold,
"is the la&s;t thing that ever can be
of any con&s;equence to me; and if my ac|tions
are, as I apprehend, of as little to
you, I imagine we can, find &s;ome plea&s;anter
topic than either the one or the other on
which to entertain this lady."</P>
<P>He then approached Cele&s;tina, who was,
he &s;aw, ready to &s;ink from her chair; and
&s;oftening his voice, &s;aid&mdash;"You are ill I
am afraid."</P>
<P>"No," replied &s;he; "but I am alarmed
and unea&s;y; and I beg of you," continued
&s;he, lowering her voice, "I beg of you
to keep your temper, let Mr. Vava&s;our &s;ay
what he will."</P>
<P>"I cannot promi&s;e that," &s;aid he in the
&s;ame tone; "but I can promi&s;e never vo|luntarily
to do or &s;ay any thing that &s;hall
give you a moment's pain. Do not be &s;o
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, I be&s;eech you; let me find Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone. You tremble: you &s;eem
ready to faint."</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="164">
"I am indeed," replied &s;he, "affected
from numberle&s;s cau&s;es. If you will be &s;o
good as to call Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, I will be
much obliged to you."</P>
<P>Thorold went immediately to obey her;
and Vava&s;our approaching her, cried&mdash;"I
&s;ee how it is; that young fellow is to con|&s;ole
you for the lo&s;s of Willoughby. Your
partiality to him I always &s;u&s;pected, and
am now too well convinced of it."</P>
<P>"Well, Sir," cried Cele&s;tina, a&s;&s;uming
in &s;ome degree her u&s;ual &s;pirit; "and ad|mitting
it to be &s;o, I do not really under|&s;tand
by what pretence you call me to an
account for it."</P>
<P>"By my own long and ardent affection
for you," cried he; "of which, however
you may now chu&s;e to affect ignorance,
you cannot have been ignorant. I &s;acri|ficed
it to Willoughby's prior claim, and
to your vi&s;ible attachment to him; but I
am not humble enough to withdraw my
preten&s;ions in favour of &s;uch a raw boy as
Montague Thorold."</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="165">
"I am obliged to you, Sir," an&s;wered
Cele&s;tina, "for the predilection you avow
in my favour: though it cannot <HI>command</HI>
my affection, it demands my &s;incerity; and
I therefore a&s;&s;ure you, that though I am
now perhaps at liberty, I have no intention
of engaging my&s;elf again. I &s;hall hope to
be allowed to con&s;ider both you and Mr.
Thorold as my friends, while I ab&s;olutely
decline any preference to either."</P>
<P>The pride of Vava&s;our was hurt ex|tremely
by this &s;peech. Though he was
not per&s;onally vain, yet he had from his in|fancy
been &s;o accu&s;tomed to have his own
way, that oppo&s;ition from any quarter was
new and in&s;upportable to him. Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
and Thorold at this moment en|tering
the room, he for once checked him|&s;elf;
and breakfa&s;t being ready, he was in|vited
to partake of it, which however he
declined, but told Cele&s;tina, on retiring,
that he mu&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee her again alone in
an hour.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="166">
Cele&s;tina now attempted to repre&s;s the
various emotions with which &s;he was agi|tated,
and to quiet the throbbings of her
heart. She &s;at down to the table, and tried
to eat, but could not; while Montague
Thorold, watching with eager fondne&s;s
every turn of her countenance, officiou&s;ly
tried to engage her to partake of the break|fa&s;t
that was before her.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he could, however, &s;he with|drew;
and after a moment's pau&s;e alone,
her &s;cattered and oppre&s;&s;ed &s;en&s;es were col|lected
enough to bring before her all that
had happened, and tears, which &s;he had
not hitherto been able to &s;hed, came to her
relief.</P>
<P>Her rea&s;on too, came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and &s;trengthened the re&s;olution &s;he had
formed after her fir&s;t peru&s;al of Willough|by's
letter. But though &s;he was able to
decide on what &s;he ought to do her&s;elf,
&s;he &s;aw many painful circum&s;tances likely
to be created by the violence of Vava&s;our,
and the impo&s;&s;ibility of prevailing either
<PB N="157" REF="167">
on him or on Montague Thorold to leave
her and Mrs. Elphin&s;tone to pur&s;ue their
journey with the others; or, what &s;he
would &s;till have preferred, of continuing it
without the attendance of either.</P>
<P>When the mind is oppre&s;&s;ed with any
heavy affliction, the le&s;s &s;erious evils which
at other times it can repel or &s;ubmit to, are
felt with painful impatience. Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone,
drooping and depre&s;&s;ed from her
pa&s;t &s;ufferings and future apprehen&s;ions,
could no longer interpo&s;e to check the
impetuo&s;ity of two young men, each of
whom thought him&s;elf at liberty to attend
on Cele&s;tina: while Cele&s;tina her&s;elf, who
never meant to encourage either, and who&s;e
heart was &s;o recently wounded by the dread
of having lo&s;t that protection on which &s;he
was wont with fondne&s;s to rely, was yet
more unequal to the exertion which was
nece&s;&s;ary to part the&s;e men, who were de|termined
to look upon each other as rivals,
or to keep them within the bounds of ci|vility
<PB N="158" REF="168">
if they per&s;i&s;ted in remaining toge|ther.</P>
<P>Anxious to proceed towards the hou&s;e
of Cathcart, and to put her children under
the care of her brother, while &s;he her&s;elf
tried to enter on &s;ome mode of life by which
to procure them a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
became impatient of any farther
delay; while Cele&s;tina, though equally
anxious to get forward, trembled at the
thought of a journey, which &s;he fore&s;aw
would produce a quarrel, and perhaps a
duel, before they had proceeded three
&s;tages.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;he thought of leaving the
whole party abruptly, and going on as
&s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible alone: but be&s;ides her
unwillingne&s;s to leave Mrs. Elphin&s;tone,
&s;he fore&s;aw that if &s;he did, this Vava&s;our
would follow and overtake her; and Tho|rold
would hardly content him&s;elf with at|tending
her friend, while certain that Va|va&s;our
was with her. After much con&s;ider|ation,
therefore, nothing &s;eemed to remain,
<PB N="159" REF="169">
but to endeavour to prevail on Thorold to
go forward without them; than which, no|thing
&s;eemed much more unlikely to &s;uc|ceed,
unle&s;s it was the &s;ame attempt on
Vava&s;our. She felt, too, a reluctance in
a&s;king a favour of Thorold, which he
might interpret as encouragement &s;he never
meant to give him; and was afraid that the
a&s;&s;urances &s;he mu&s;t make him in regard to
her total indifference towards Vava&s;our,
might afford him rea&s;on to hope, that to|wards
him &s;he would be le&s;s inexorable.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, immediately
to make the e&s;&s;ay; and therefore &s;ending
for Mr. Thorold, &s;he with trembling he&s;i|tation
told him, that the letters brought by
Mr. Vava&s;our had been deci&s;ive in regard
to ending the intended alliance between her
and Mr. Willoughby. But &s;he had hardly
uttered the word Willoughby, before the
countenance of Montague Thorold was
animated with all the warm hopes to which
this intelligence gave birth. She &s;aw it
with concern; and with as much re&s;olu|tion
<PB N="160" REF="170">
as &s;he could, be&s;ought him to attend
to her, while with a faultering voice, and
her tears with difficulty repre&s;&s;ed, &s;he went
on&mdash;"That I &s;hall now never be the wife
of Willoughby is certain: but do not mi&s;|under&s;tand
me; I have determined never
to be the wife of any other per&s;on. I &s;hall
go, for the re&s;t of the winter, to Lady
Horatia Howard, and afterwards retire to
&s;ome village as remote as po&s;&s;ible from
that part of England where I once ex|pected
to pa&s;s my life. This re&s;olution is
unalterable. But though I never can re|turn
as you wi&s;h the favourable &s;entiments
with which you have honoured me, my
friend&s;hip, my gratitude, my e&s;teem, it is
in your power to &s;ecure and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Friend&s;hip! gratitude! e&s;teem!"
cried Montague Thorold. "Can I be
content with &s;uch cold words: I, who can
never for an in&s;tant di&s;engage my thoughts
from you; I, who wor&s;hip your very &s;ha|dow,
and who cannot bear the thoughts of
quitting you even for a moment! Oh!
<PB N="161" REF="171">
Cele&s;tina! if ever the mo&s;t pure and vio|lent
love de&s;erved a return&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Forgive me," cried Cele&s;tina, "if in
my turn I interrupt you. Do you not mi&s;|take
your &s;entiments, or, by an abu&s;e of
terms, call a tran&s;ient liking by that name
which ought to belong only to that refined
affection of the heart which leads us to pre|fer
the happine&s;s of another to our own,
and to &s;acrifice every inferior con&s;ideration
to the &s;ublime plea&s;ure of promoting that
happine&s;s."</P>
<P>"Heaven and earth!" cried Thorold
impetuou&s;ly, "and do I not feel that &s;en|timent
in all its purity for you? Would I
not lay down my life to procure you any
real&mdash;almo&s;t any imaginary good."</P>
<P>"Prove it," interrupted Cele&s;tina,
"prove it by obliging me in the reque&s;t I
am going to make: a reque&s;t in which I
mu&s;t not be refu&s;ed, and which, before I
make it, you mu&s;t ab&s;olutely promi&s;e to
grant."</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="172">
"I promi&s;e," returned Thorold, who
had at that moment no idea whither her
reque&s;t tended, "I promi&s;e to obey you,
even though you de&s;ired my death. If the
&s;acrifice I make has any merit in your eyes,
how cheaply would your approbation be
purcha&s;ed even by the lo&s;s of exi&s;tence."</P>
<P>"All that is very ab&s;urd and very wild,"
replied Cele&s;tina. "What I a&s;k you can
ea&s;ily do, and ought to do without reluc|tance."</P>
<P>"Name it," cried he, "and &s;ee how
well I can obey you."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina then told him, that Vava&s;our,
fancying his friend&s;hip with Mr. Willough|by
gave him a right to attend her, meant,
&s;he feared, to go on with her and Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
to London; "And from the
dialogues which have twice pa&s;&s;ed between
you and him," added &s;he, "there is rea|&s;on
to apprehend that your continuing to|gether
may be attended with very unplea|&s;ant
con&s;equences: neither Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone
or I have courage to encounter the
<PB N="163" REF="173">
&s;ort of contention which may ari&s;e between
you: and to avoid the hazard of it, allow
us to thank you for all the trouble you have
taken for us, and now to bid you adieu till
we meet again in Devon&s;hire."</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, who from the mo|ment
he under&s;tood her had li&s;tened with
impatience, now prote&s;ted that the promi&s;e
he had ju&s;t given could not be binding in
an in&s;tance that mu&s;t be as injurious to his
honour as cruel, to his feelings. "Why
&s;hould you &s;uffer this Mr. Vava&s;our," &s;aid
he, "to force him&s;elf upon you, while
you drive me from you? What is this chi|merical
claim that he derives from Wil|loughby,
who has re&s;igned his own; and
how poor and &s;piritle&s;s mu&s;t I appear, who
having been permitted that of &s;eeing
you thus far on your journey, con&s;ent to
re&s;ign to another the honour of attending
you to the end of it: to another, who a&s;|&s;umes
a right no better founded than my
own; and to whom I am to give place
for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e he rudely
<PB N="164" REF="174">
demands it. You would de&s;pi&s;e me, Ma|dam,
and I &s;hould de&s;erve to be de&s;pi&s;ed,
were I capable of &s;o mean a de&s;ertion."</P>
<P>This was exactly what Cele&s;tina feared;
but per&s;i&s;ting in her re&s;olution to e&s;cape the
alarm to which &s;he mu&s;t be &s;ubject from
Vava&s;our and Montague Thorold's being
together during the journey, &s;he told the
latter very calmly, that unle&s;s he con&s;ented
to oblige her, and to go forward under pre|tence
of being obliged to return home,
that their acquaintance mu&s;t here end for
ever.</P>
<P>Even again&s;t this, fear, his reluctante to
yield, or to appear, to yield the right of at|tending
her to Vava&s;our, awhile &s;upported
him. The dread, too, leaft Vava&s;our
&s;hould now &s;ucceed for him&s;elf, and that he
&s;hould &s;ee tho&s;e hopes de&s;troyed for ever
which he &s;o fondly cheri&s;hed &s;ince Willoughby
was out of the que&s;tion, made him
re&s;i&s;t &s;till more forcibly the injunctions
Cele&s;tina de&s;ired to lay upon him. At
length, his fear of offending her, his real
<PB N="165" REF="175">
love for her, and the &s;ight of her unea&s;ine&s;s;
her a&s;&s;urances that Vava&s;our never would
have any particular intere&s;t in her favour,
(though at the &s;ame time &s;he bade him un|der&s;tand
that he had him&s;elf no better
claim,) and his wi&s;h to &s;hew her how much
he preferred her &s;atisfaction to his own,
prevailed upon him to &s;acrifice his pride
and his fears to her entreaties; and making
him&s;elf acquainted with the place where
&s;he was to be with Mrs. Elphin&s;tone in
London, where he obtained permi&s;&s;ion to
attend her as &s;oon as &s;he arrived, Monta|gue
Thorold, though &s;till reluctantly and
with great compul&s;ion on him&s;elf, departed
alone, and on po&s;t hor&s;es pur&s;ued his way
to London.</P>
<P>Having thus prevailed on Thorold to
depart, Cele&s;tina again &s;at down to recol|lect
her fatigued &s;pirits. She had &s;ome
hours before determined to write to Lady
Horatia Howard, and accept of the invi|tation
&s;o repeatedly offered her, as &s;oon as
&s;he &s;aw Mrs. Elphin&s;tone &s;afe in the pro|tection
<PB N="166" REF="176">
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cathcart, who was
to meet them in London.</P>
<P>This letter, therefore, &s;he wrote, and
forwarded; and as neither the weather or
any other circum&s;tance was now likely to
render their progre&s;s hazardous, Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
agreed that they would &s;et out at
a very early hour the next morning.</P>
<P>The day, however, was of nece&s;&s;ity to
be ended where they were; and it was
very certain that Vava&s;our would pa&s;s it
with them. He had ordered for them
every thing they were likely to have occa|&s;ion
for, in a &s;tile infinitely &s;uperior to
what they would them&s;elves have thought
of; and when they met at dinner, he re|ceived
them as his gue&s;ts, and when his
natural vivacity was heightened by that
&s;ort of triumph that he felt on finding that
Thorold was gone, his exulting &s;pirits
were &s;uch as to be cruelly oppre&s;&s;ive both
to Mrs. Elphin&s;tone and Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>Incapable of entering into <HI>their</HI> feelings,
he had no idea of repre&s;&s;ing his own. He
<PB N="167" REF="177">
fancied there no longer exi&s;ted any ob&s;tacle
to his project in regard to Cele&s;tina; and
as that project had long been the fir&s;t of
his heart, and had become doubly impor|tant
from the oppo&s;ition it had met with,
he concealed no part of the plea&s;ure he felt
at what he fancied the ab&s;olute certainty of
its immediate accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>This was conduct that was in&s;upportably
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to Cele&s;tina. He &s;poke without
&s;cruple of the re&s;ignation Willoughby had
made of her hand, and &s;eemed to have as
little delicacy as to the occa&s;ion of it. Of
an attachment to him, ab&s;tracted from
every idea of becoming his wife, Vava&s;our
had no idea; and Cele&s;tina had no courage
to urge it; &s;o entirely did his want of feel|ing,
and the proud certainty he &s;hewed of
his own &s;ucce&s;s, overwhelm her. All &s;he
could do was, to entreat Mrs. Elphin&s;tone
not to leave her with him, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t her
as much as po&s;&s;ible in attempting at lea&s;t
to check that a&s;&s;uming manner, for which
neither her former friend&s;hip for Vava&s;our,
<PB N="168" REF="178">
nor the regard Willoughby had for him,
could, in her opinion, offer any apology.</P>
<P>Fortunately, however, for both her and
her friend, two young men of fortune,
much acquainted with Vava&s;our, arrived
at the inn early in the evening, and &s;eeing
his &s;ervants, enquired for him, and were
&s;hewn into the room almo&s;t as &s;oon as din|ner
was over. Cele&s;tina and her friend
took the earlie&s;t opportunity to withdraw;
and Vava&s;our's attention to his gue&s;ts over
their wine, delivered them for the re&s;t of
the evening from his company.</P>
<P>He had taken care, however, to inform
him&s;elf of all that related to their journey
the next day. But eager as he was to have
Cele&s;tina in the chai&s;e with him, he was
compelled to de&s;i&s;t from the reque&s;t he at
fir&s;t ventured to make, on her repre&s;enting
the impo&s;&s;ibility of her leaving Mrs. El|phin&s;tone;
to whom, though Vava&s;our
heartily wi&s;hed her once more in the He|brides,
he had at length the complai&s;ance
to offer his place in his own chai&s;e, as being
<PB N="169" REF="179">
more commodious than the hired ones to
be found on the road; and agreed, on her
acquie&s;cence in that arrangement, to fol|low
him&s;elf in a hack chai&s;e with his &s;er|vant.</P>
<P>The gentlemen who had pa&s;&s;ed the even|ing
with him at the inn, were not le&s;s fond
of the plea&s;ures of the table than he was
him&s;elf; and their orgies had been pro|longed
till it was no longer worth while for
him to go to bed. With a very little al|teration
of his dre&s;s therefore, and with a
great deal of wine &s;till in his head, he was
ready in the morning to &s;et out: but &s;uch
was his appearance, and &s;uch his manners
in con&s;equence of his debauch the pre|ceding
evening, that Cele&s;tina was more
than ever &s;olicitous to avoid him; and had
it been po&s;&s;ible for her to have thought of
him before with the &s;lighte&s;t degree of par|tiality,
his looks and his conver&s;ation of
this morning would have filled her with ter|ror
and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="180">
As &s;he travelled on, however, by the
&s;ide of her dejected friend, who had no
&s;pirits for conver&s;ation, &s;he could not, amid
all the reflection on her own circum&s;tances,
which filled her mind, avoid con&s;idering,
with, melancholy regret, the &s;ituation of
this young man, who, with &s;ome talents
and many virtues, was thus yielding to the
wild current of pa&s;&s;ion and vice, and de|&s;troying
his con&s;titution and his fortune
before he knew the value of either. She
then with mournful recollection contra&s;ted
his character with that of Willoughby,
who had once all his vivacity, tempered
with &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s, &s;o much attention
to the feelings of others; who had all his
genero&s;ity of &s;pirit and openne&s;s of heart,
without any of his carele&s;s di&s;&s;ipation; and
who&s;e brighter talents were not ob&s;cured by
vice, nor degraded by folly; and as all his
virtues, all his amiable qualities were enu|merated,
her heart felt all the acutene&s;s of
&s;orrow, in remembering too that under
their influence &s;he had lo&s;t the hope of
<PB N="171" REF="181">
pa&s;&s;ing her life: yet the cruel pain of the
reflection that the&s;e hopes were now at an
end, was immediately mitigated, when &s;he
con&s;idered, that this &s;he might perhaps
&s;till do, as his &s;i&s;ter and his friend; but her
rea&s;on, however it began to recover its
tone, could never &s;ay any thing to her that
for a moment taught her to reflect with
plea&s;ure, or even with tranquillity, on the
thoughts of his being united to Mi&s;s Fitz|Hayman.</P>
<P>On reperu&s;ing Willoughby's letter, which
&s;he had now acquired courage to &s;tudy
more minutely, &s;he &s;aw with new unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
what in the fir&s;t tumult of her &s;pirits
had e&s;caped her, or at lea&s;t made but a
&s;light impre&s;&s;ion&mdash;that he recommended
her particularly to the care and protection
of Vava&s;our; and that, as he had probably
intimated the &s;ame tru&s;t to Vava&s;our him|&s;elf,
&s;he &s;hould find it very difficult to di&s;|engage
her&s;elf from his attendance.</P>
<P>The longer &s;he dwelt on Willoughby's
expre&s;&s;ions, the more &s;he apprehended he
<PB N="172" REF="182">
was but too well convinced that the whole
&s;tory of their relation&s;hip did not originate
with Lady Ca&s;tlenorth. She fore&s;aw, that
while even the &s;hadow of a doubt remained,
their union never ought to be thought of:
but having nobody with whom &s;he could
properly di&s;cu&s;s the various and contradic|tory
ideas on this bewildering &s;ubject that
pa&s;&s;ed through her mind, &s;he looked forward
with earne&s;t impatience to the hour when
&s;he &s;hould receive the maternal coun&s;el and
&s;oothing con&s;olation which Lady Horatia
Howard alone was likely to afford her.</P>
<P>The journey, however, was to be per|formed;
and though &s;he carefully avoided,
during the two days that it la&s;ted, being
alone with Vava&s;our, yet &s;he &s;uffered ex|treme
pain from the encrea&s;ing conviction
that he pre&s;umed on Willoughby's total
re&s;ignation of her, and openly declared
that he thought him&s;elf a candidate for her
favour, who&s;e fortune and preten&s;ions of
every kind rendered him &s;ecure of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="183">
At length the party reached London,
and Cathcart received his &s;i&s;ter and her
friend at the lodgings he had prepared, for
them on being informed of the time of their
arrival.</P>
<P>The meeting between him and Mrs. El|phin&s;tone
was too affecting to the already
depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of Cele&s;tina. She retired
early to her own room, having with diffi|culty
prevailed on Vava&s;our to quit her,
and there endeavoured to acquire &s;teadine&s;s
to talk over with Cathcart, the next morn|ing,
the purport of Willoughby's letter;
and then to take leave of him and her poor
dejected friend, as Lady Horatia Howard
had received with avidity the information
of her intended vi&s;it to her, and was to &s;end
her coach for her at one o'clock on the
following day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE morning at length arrived, and
the friends who had &s;o long found all the
con&s;olation their circum&s;tances admitted of
in being together, were now to part; un|certain
when, or if ever, they were to meet
again. Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, &s;inking as &s;he
was under oppre&s;&s;ion of many pre&s;ent for|rows
and future apprehen&s;ions, yet found
them all deepened by the lo&s;s of Cele&s;tina,
who had &s;o generou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in &s;up|porting
them: and Cele&s;tina felt, that
when to &s;oothe the &s;pirits and &s;trengthen
the re&s;olution of her friend was no longer
her immediate ta&s;k, &s;he &s;hould dwell with
more painful and more &s;teady &s;olicitude on
her own &s;ingular and unfortunate &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="185">
Cathcart, warmly attached as he was to
both, from gratitude and from affection,
had no power to &s;peak comfort to either.
Early in the morning he had met Cele&s;tina,
and gone through Willoughby's letter:
but though his mind &s;ometimes &s;trongly
re&s;i&s;ted the idea of that relation&s;hip of
which it &s;poke, he had nothing to offer
again&s;t it; and could only &s;igh over the
incurable unhappine&s;s with which he &s;aw
the future days of friends he &s;o much loved
would be clouded.</P>
<P>Silently they all a&s;&s;embled round the
breakfa&s;t table; but nobody could eat.
Cathcart tried to talk of Je&s;&s;y, of his hou&s;e,
of his farm, of his fortunate pro&s;pects, and
of his &s;i&s;ter's two little girls, whom he had
taken home; but there was not one topic
on which he could &s;peak that did not re|mind
him of the obligations he owed to
Cele&s;tina and Willoughby, nor one idea
which aro&s;e unembittered with the reflec|tion,
that they, to whom he was indebted
<PB N="176" REF="186">
for all <HI>his</HI> happine&s;s, were them&s;elves mi|&s;erable.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock Vava&s;our came into
the room in his u&s;ual way; enquired eagerly
of Cele&s;tina when &s;he went to Lady Hora|tia
Howard's, and when he could &s;ee her
there; and without waiting for an an&s;wer
to his enquiry, told her that he had that
morning met Sir Philip Molyneux, and
that Lady Molyneux had been in town
about a week. Every body who were re|lated
to Willoughby was intere&s;ting to Ce|le&s;tina;
and from Lady Molyneux &s;he had
always &s;uppo&s;ed more might be collected
than from any other per&s;on: but now her
mind was too much oppre&s;&s;ed and too
much confu&s;ed to allow her to di&s;tingui&s;h
her &s;en&s;ations, or to arrange any &s;ettled
plan for her future conduct towards Lady
Molyneux. She received Vava&s;our's in|formation,
therefore, with coldne&s;s; and
indeed her manners towards him were very
con&s;trained and di&s;tant, which he either
did not or would not notice; rattling on in
<PB N="177" REF="187">
his u&s;ual wild way, though he &s;aw the de|jection
and concern of the party; a circum|&s;tance
that more than ever di&s;gu&s;ted Ce|le&s;tina,
who began &s;ome time before to
doubt whether the credit which Vava&s;our
had for good nature was not given him on
very &s;lender foundations: for to be &s;o en|tirely
occupied by his own plea&s;ures and
pur&s;uits as to be incapable of the lea&s;t &s;ym|pathy
towards others, to be unable or un|willing
to check for one moment his viva|city
in compliment to their de&s;pondence,
&s;eemed to Cele&s;tina &s;uch a want of &s;en&s;i|bility,
as gave her a very indifferent opinion
of his heart.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphin&s;tone quitted the room to
make the la&s;t preparations for her departure:
but Cathcart, who had fettled every thing
before, remained with Cele&s;tina and Vava|&s;our.
He would have given the world to
have pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e moments in conver&s;ation
with her; but the pre&s;ence of a third per|&s;on,
and e&s;pecially of Vava&s;our, put an end
to all hope he had of an opportunity of
<PB N="178" REF="188">
explaining to her, with that tenderne&s;s and
caution which the &s;ubject required, &s;ome
circum&s;tances relative to Willoughby's for|tune,
which had lately come to his know|ledge.
New embarra&s;&s;ments &s;eemed threat|ening
him; and a law &s;uit, involving part
of the property which belonged to Alve&s;|tone
e&s;tate, &s;eemed likely to encrea&s;e the&s;e
embarra&s;&s;ments; while the mortgagees
were gradually undermining the e&s;tate it|&s;elf;
and the ab&s;ence of the ma&s;ter en|crea&s;ed
the impatience and mi&s;tru&s;t of tho&s;e
who had claims upon it.</P>
<P>All this, Cathcart thought Cele&s;tina
ought to know; yet in their fir&s;t interview
that morning he had not courage to tell
her of it, and now Vava&s;our left him no
chance of doing it; for while he yet deli|berated,
the coach &s;ent by Lady Horatia
Howard &s;topped at the door, and the mo|ment
was come in which he was to take his
leave of her.</P>
<P>He took her hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it with an
air of grateful re&s;pect; but he could only
<PB N="179" REF="189">
&s;ay&mdash;"I &s;hall write to you in a few days,
and, I hope, give you a good account of
my &s;i&s;ter and of Je&s;&s;y."</P>
<P>"I hope you will," returned Cele&s;tina
faintly.</P>
<P>"And," added he, "you will of cour&s;e
like to hear of all that pa&s;&s;es material in our
neighbourhood?"</P>
<P>"Certainly I &s;hall," replied &s;he. "Adieu,
dear Sir. I cannot <HI>&s;ay</HI> much, but you
know what I feel for you all."</P>
<P>Vava&s;our had taken her hand to lead her
down &s;tairs; but &s;he di&s;engaged it from
him, and &s;aid to Cathcart, as &s;he gave it
to him&mdash;"Let us go to your &s;i&s;ter." He
led her to the door of the room; where at
that moment Mrs. Elphin&s;tone entered,
pale and breathle&s;s: her eyes were heavy,
and fixed on Cele&s;tina, but &s;he did not
weep. Cele&s;tina's tears, however, were
more ready, and, as &s;he embraced her
friend, they choaked the trembling adieu
&s;he would have uttered, and fell in &s;howers
on her bo&s;om. The emotion was too pain|ful;
<PB N="180" REF="190">
and Cathcart, de&s;iring to end it for
both their &s;akes, di&s;engaged his &s;i&s;ter
gently from the arms of the trembling Ce|le&s;tina,
while Vava&s;our, again &s;eizing her
hand, hurried her down &s;tairs, and as he
put her into the coach, told her he &s;hould
call upon her the next day. She would
have be&s;ought him not to do it, as a liberty
he ought not to take in the hou&s;e whither
&s;he was going; but before &s;he could &s;uffi|ciently
recover her&s;elf to find words, the
coach was driven away, and in a few mo|ments
&s;he found her&s;elf at the door of Lady
Horatia Howard, in Park-&s;treet, Gro&s;venor|&s;quare,
and it became nece&s;&s;ary for her to
collect her &s;pirits, to acquit her&s;elf as &s;o
much kind attention de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia received her with un|feigned
plea&s;ure, and with a degree of ma|ternal
kindne&s;s that &s;et her almo&s;t imme|diately
at ea&s;e with her&s;elf. She was put
into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her apartment, and bade
to remember that it was her's as long as &s;he
would occupy it, and that her time was al|ways
<PB N="181" REF="191">
ways to be her own. "I am going out,"
&s;aid Lady Horatia, "to dinner to-day. I
have a great notion you had rather dine at
home?" Cele&s;tina owned &s;he had. "Be
it &s;o then," replied &s;he: "and whenever
you prefer being at home to going with
me, I &s;hall be plea&s;ed at your u&s;ing that
freedom, without which &s;uch a &s;ituation as
I am able to offer you would be not only of
no value but a &s;pecies of &s;lavery." While
&s;he &s;aid this in the kinde&s;t manner, Cele&s;|tina
ob&s;erved that &s;he looked very earne&s;tly
at her eyes, which were red with weeping;
and examined, with a kind of mournful
enquiry, her features, which bore traces of
the concern &s;he had felt in parting from
her friends; and having thus examined her
countenance &s;ome time, her own, which
was remarkably expre&s;&s;ive, a&s;&s;umed a look
of &s;urpri&s;e tempered with concern; and
then, as if &s;he checked her&s;elf, &s;he rang
for her woman to receive orders about Ce|le&s;tina's
dinner, and while they remained
<PB N="182" REF="192">
together, &s;he gave the conver&s;ation a more
general turn.</P>
<P>When Cele&s;tina was alone, &s;he ran over
in her thoughts the tran&s;actions of the la&s;t
month, and wondered what Fate would
do with her next. But not of her&s;elf alone
&s;he thought: Willoughby, unhappy and
un&s;ettled; his mind thrown from its ba|lance
by di&s;appointment; his talents lo&s;t
in the bewildering unea&s;ine&s;s of uncer|tainty,
and his temper injured by the cor|ro&s;ive
anxieties of pecuniary inconvenience;
he, who had &s;uch a mind, &s;uch a heart,
&s;uch talents, &s;uch a temper; who de&s;erved
every happine&s;s, and yet had hitherto
known none; Willoughby, wandering
about the world to obtain confirmation of
a fact, which, when known, would only
complete his mi&s;ery; was an object from
which the thoughts of Cele&s;tina could ne|ver
a moment e&s;cape: and a thou&s;and
times &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he had never been born,
&s;ince to her, to whom&s;oever &s;he owed her
<PB N="183" REF="193">
birth, Willoughby certainly owed his un|happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was time to con&s;ider of obeying the
injunction he gave her, towards the clo&s;e
of his letter, to write to him; but on this
&s;ubject &s;he determined to con&s;ult Lady
Horatia Howard, as well as to a&s;k her ad|vice
in what way &s;he &s;hould act in regard
to Vava&s;our, who&s;e importunities &s;he
dreaded, yet from who&s;e vi&s;its &s;he knew
not how to di&s;engage her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch protection, however, &s;he
knew that much of the inconvenience &s;he
mu&s;t in other circum&s;tances feel from Va|va&s;our's
behaviour would be obviated; and
that the &s;en&s;e as well as the &s;ituation of
Lady Horatia would prevent that improper
familiarity which, when &s;he was only with
Cathcart or Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, whom he
looked upon as inferior and as dependent,
it was too much his nature to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>With more complacency, &s;he thought
of Montague Thorold, and always of his
father with a degree of affectionate reve|rence.
<PB N="184" REF="194">
As to the young man, though her
heart never admitted, in regard to him, the
&s;lighte&s;t tendency towards that &s;ort of par|tiality
which could ever grow into love, yet
&s;he had received &s;o many marks of real and
ardent attachment from him, &s;he thought
&s;o well of his talents, and &s;o much better
of his heart, that &s;he could never dive&s;t
her&s;elf of &s;olicitude for his welfare. Per|haps&mdash;for
in what heart, however pure,
does not &s;ome &s;uch weakne&s;s lurk&mdash;perhaps,
the &s;tories &s;he had heard of his former uni|ver&s;al
propen&s;ity to form attachments, and
which were intended to prejudice her
again&s;t him, had an influence on her mind
of which &s;he was her&s;elf uncon&s;cious, and
that her &s;elf-love, though no human being
ever appeared to have le&s;s, was gratified by
having thus fixed a man &s;o volatile and un|&s;teady,
though &s;he never could, nor ever
had given him rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he could,
return the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had thus in&s;pired.</P>
<P>While there remained any hope of ever
&s;eeing Willoughby &s;uch as he had once
<PB N="185" REF="195">
been, &s;he had felt an utter repugnance to
&s;uffer the a&s;&s;iduities of Montague Thorold;
but Willoughby's apparent neglect of her
for &s;ome time before &s;he left the I&s;le of
Skie, and the little probability there now
was that they could ever meet in peace,
&s;ince the receipt of his letter, had gra|dually
and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly accu&s;tomed
her to the attentions of Montague Tho|rold:
and though &s;he felt for him no|thing
like love, &s;he could not help being
&s;en&s;ible of a great difference in her &s;enti|ments
towards him and towards Vava&s;our.
One &s;eemed to live only to obey and oblige
her; the other, pre&s;uming on the advan|tages
of fortune, or on tho&s;e which Wil|loughby's
friend&s;hip gave him, appeared
rather to demand than to &s;olicit her re|gard&mdash;rather
to re&s;ent her neglect of his
&s;uit, than court as a favour her acceptance
of it: and if Cele&s;tina had any fault, it
was a &s;ort of latent pride, the child of con|&s;cious
worth and elevated under&s;tanding;
which, though &s;he was certainly ob&s;curely,
and po&s;&s;ibly di&s;honourably born, &s;he never
<PB N="186" REF="196">
could &s;ubdue, and, perhaps, never &s;e|riou&s;ly
tried to &s;ubdue it. She felt, that in
point of intellect &s;he was &s;uperior to almo&s;t
every body &s;he conver&s;ed with; &s;he could
not look in the gla&s;s without &s;eeing the re|flection
of a form, worthy of &s;o fair an in|habitant
as an enlightened human &s;oul;
and could &s;he have been blind to the&s;e
advantages, the preference Willoughby had
given her &s;o early in life would have taught
her all their value.</P>
<P>It is not the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of worth that
is offen&s;ive and di&s;gu&s;ting, but the tribute
of re&s;pect that is demanded of others who
have perhaps no &s;uch conviction, and of
whom it is therefore unrea&s;onable and ar|rogant
to expect that they will acknowledge
what they cannot perceive. Nobody was
ever yet eminently hand&s;ome in per&s;on, or
eminently brilliant in intellect, who did
not feel from &s;elf evidence that they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
tho&s;e advantages; though many, from
the infirmity and weakne&s;s of their tem|pers,
<PB N="187" REF="197">
fancy they exi&s;t where none but them|&s;elves
can find any &s;hadow of them.</P>
<P>Good &s;en&s;e, one prominent feature of
which is a due attention to the opinion and
to the &s;elf love of the re&s;t of the world,
will rarely &s;uffer tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it to ob|trude
even real advantages on the notice
of others; and without good &s;en&s;e, little
di&s;tinction appears between the real bloom
of youth and beauty and the factitious
charms purcha&s;ed at a per&s;umer's: both
are, if not equally di&s;gu&s;ting, equally de|void
of all that can make them e&s;timable
or valuable. Of this good &s;en&s;e, Cele&s;tina
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;hare, that con&s;cious as
&s;he was of that &s;uperiority of which &s;he was
continually told, no village girl had ever
more unaffected &s;implicity of manners;
and while her mind was irradiated by more
than common genius, and her knowledge
very exten&s;ive for her time of life, &s;he was
in company as &s;ilent, and as attentive to
the opinion of others, as if &s;he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
only a plain and common under&s;tanding,
<PB N="188" REF="198">
with no other cultivation than what a com|mon
boarding &s;chool education afforded.</P>
<P>Her pride, therefore, &s;o moderated, was
rather a virtue than a blemi&s;h, and taught
her to value her&s;elf, but never to de&s;pi&s;e
the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>There was about her, too, much of that
di&s;po&s;ition which the French call <HI>amenet&eacute;:</HI>
a di&s;po&s;ition to plea&s;e by &s;eeming inte|re&s;ted
for others; by entering into their
joys and &s;orrows, and by a thou&s;and little
namele&s;s kindne&s;&s;es, which though they
con&s;i&s;ted perhaps only in attending pa|tiently
to a tale of &s;orrow, told by a
mourner of whom the world was tired or
who was tired of the world, or li&s;tening
with concern to the hi&s;tory of pain and con|finement
related by the valetudinarian,
&s;miling at the fond enthu&s;ia&s;m of a mother
when &s;he de&s;cribed the wit or beauty of a
darling child, or admiring the plans which
an improver had laid down for the altera|tion
of his grounds, were all &s;o many te&s;ti|monies
of a good di&s;po&s;ition, in the opi|nion
<PB N="189" REF="199">
of tho&s;e towards whom the&s;e little ci|vilities
were exerted, that Cele&s;tina had
formerly had almo&s;t as many friends as ac|quaintance
wherever &s;he appeared. In
the circle where &s;he was now to move,
more &s;plendid even than that where Mrs.
Willoughby's kindne&s;s had placed her, it
was probable that under &s;uch introduction
as that of Lady Horatia Howard, all the
charms of her per&s;on, talents, and temper,
would be &s;een to the utmo&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>Unaccu&s;tomed as Vava&s;our was to look
far into con&s;equences, he had di&s;cerned
this as &s;oon as he heard of the invitation
Cele&s;tina had received; and he fore&s;aw &s;o
many impediments to the pur&s;uit of his
wi&s;hes, as well from the &s;everity and pru|dery
which he had heard imputed to Lady
Horatia, as from the interference of rivals,
that he would very gladly have per&s;uaded
her again&s;t accepting it, had he had any
pretence to offer for his objections: but
having none, and not daring to invent any,
he had confined him&s;elf to mutterings
<PB N="190" REF="200">
again&s;t prudi&s;h old cats, and repre&s;enting
to Cele&s;tina that, &s;he was going to confine
her&s;elf as an humble companion to bear all
the caprices of a &s;uperannuated woman of
quality. Cele&s;tina heard him at fir&s;t with
concern, from an idea that he had heard
Lady Horatia mi&s;repre&s;ented; but when,
on his afterwards repeating this conver&s;a|tion,
&s;he found that he knew nothing of
her character even from report, and only
de&s;cribed her in &s;o unplea&s;ant a light from
his wi&s;h to deter Cele&s;tina from finding an
a&s;ylum in her hou&s;e, anger conquered her
concern, and even her complai&s;ance, and
&s;he be&s;ought him in very &s;trong terms ne|ver
again to name Lady Horatia Howard
to her, unle&s;s he could prevail upon him|&s;elf
to remember that &s;he de&s;erved, from
her character rather than her rank, the re|&s;pect
of every man, and particularly of
every <HI>gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Vavafour had de&s;i&s;ted then from talking
of her in this &s;tyle; but he was not at all
more reconciled to the abode Cele&s;tina
<PB N="191" REF="201">
had cho&s;en; where, if he was admitted to
&s;ee her at all, it would probably be only
in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who would be little
affected with his profe&s;&s;ions of that love
which every day became a greater torment
to him, and little dazzled by that fortune
which he had to offer as the price of its re|turn.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, however, to whom he had
repeatedly &s;aid that he would vi&s;it her,
thought &s;he could not too &s;oon apprize
Lady Horatia of her &s;ituation; and the fir&s;t
hour they were alone together, Lady Hora|tia
expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a de&s;ire to know all that
had pa&s;&s;ed in regard to Willoughby, &s;ince
&s;he &s;aw her on her journey into Scotland,
that Cele&s;tina, without he&s;itation, but not
without great emotion, related it all, and
put into her hands the letters received from
Willoughby.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia read them, and attended
with great intere&s;t to what Cele&s;tina related
of the &s;udden appearance of Montague
Thorold and the avowed preten&s;ions of
<PB N="192" REF="202">
Vava&s;our; and after deliberating &s;ome
time, &s;he &s;miled, yet not with a &s;mile of
plea&s;ure, and &s;aid&mdash;"It appears, my love,
as if you were only come to tantalize me
for a moment with your company; for be|&s;et
as you are by the&s;e young men, I &s;ee I
&s;hall never be able to keep you long."</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam!" replied Cele&s;tina,
"neither Mr. Vava&s;our nor Mr. Thorold
can excite a wi&s;h in me to quit your protec|tion
while it is convenient to you to afford
it to me; and for my fir&s;t, my mo&s;t beloved
friend! my&mdash;what &s;hall I call him?&mdash;he
talks not of returning to England: and if
he does&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And if he does return," interrupted
Lady Horatia, "you mu&s;t, and rightly
formed as your heart is, you do, I am &s;ure
under&s;tand, that while the fainte&s;t mi&s;t of
doubt hangs over you, you ought never to
meet him, unle&s;s indeed one of you were
married."</P>
<P>"Allow me to a&s;k, Madam," &s;aid Ce|le&s;tina,
in a tremulous voice, "allow me to
<PB N="193" REF="203">
a&s;k your Lady&s;hip, who were &s;o well ac|quainted
with Mrs. Willoughby, whether
from any recollection of remarks made in
her life time, you have any per&s;ua&s;ion as to
the foundation of tho&s;e doubts."</P>
<P>"You might have &s;een," replied Lady
Horatia, "from the purport of a letter I
wrote to you while you were in Scotland,
that I had even then heard rumours of the
cau&s;e of your &s;eparation from Willoughby,
which Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had very indu&s;|triou&s;ly
&s;et forth. I judged, from what I
then heard, that if it was not true, her art
would be &s;o effectually exerted that you
would never di&s;cover the deception; and
that you mu&s;t be rendered unhappy. It
was therefore I advi&s;ed you to detach your|&s;elf
as much as you could from what is
childi&s;hly called a fir&s;t love. I thought,
that what Mr. Willoughby was then &s;aid
to be on the point of completing&mdash;his
marriage with Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman&mdash;was the
very be&s;t thing he could do, both for his
own &s;ake and your's: for if it &s;hould be
<PB N="194" REF="204">
found you are related, the very idea is at|tended
with too much horror to be dwelt
upon; and even if it is a fabrication of Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth's, unle&s;s it can be clearly proved
to be &s;o, your whole life might be embit|tered
by it; be&s;ides, my dear Cele&s;tina,
how could Mr. Willoughby, circum&s;tanced
as I under&s;tand he is in regard to money
matters, how could he afford to marry
you?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina &s;ighed deeply from the recol|lection
of the arrangements as to all tho&s;e
affairs which Willoughby had &s;o fondly
made, and to which &s;he had &s;o fondly
li&s;tened; then recovering her&s;elf, &s;he re|peated
her que&s;tion, which &s;he thought
Lady Horatia had evaded&mdash;"But has your
Lady&s;hip any recollection of circum&s;tances
in Mrs. Willoughby's conduct or life, that
give you rea&s;on to believe this unhappy
&s;tory may <HI>not</HI> be the fabrication of Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth?"</P>
<P>"Not from my own knowledge," re|plied
&s;he, "for I was in Italy with General
<PB N="195" REF="205">
Howard, who was then in an ill &s;tate of
health, at the time Mr. Willoughby's fa|ther
died and for two years afterwards.
When I returned to England, I was ab|&s;orbed
in dome&s;tic unea&s;ine&s;s, and heard,
without attending much to them, tho&s;e
go&s;&s;ipping &s;tories which fly about for a
week or a month till &s;ome newer &s;candal
cau&s;es them to be forgotten. Yet I do re|collect,
I own, hearing &s;ome hints of Mrs.
Willoughby's partiality for Mr. Everard,
and that they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be privately
married: but I accounted for it, when I
attended to it at all, by recollecting that
Mrs. Willoughby was, at the time of her
hu&s;band's death, a young and beautiful
woman, with a good fortune, and an ad|mirable
under&s;tanding; advantages, which,
while they created envy and malignity in
the minds of an hundred people who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
nothing of all that, among her own
&s;ex; produced as many pretenders to her
favour among the other; every one of
whom, though &s;ome were men of rank and
<PB N="196" REF="206">
all of cour&s;e eminent enough in their own
eyes, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by her on their fir&s;t
application with a polite but po&s;itive re|fu&s;al.
The&s;e men were piqued, and the&s;e
women were &s;piteful; and they together
found out a rea&s;on for the unheard of re|fu&s;al
of a young and admired widow, by
&s;uppo&s;ing her attached to her &s;on's tutor;
not one of them, from the information of
their own hearts, being able to conceive it
po&s;&s;ible that &s;he made this &s;acrifice to ma|ternal
tenderne&s;s, and refu&s;ed her hand to
a &s;econd hu&s;band, becau&s;e &s;he would &s;uffer
nothing to interrupt the attention &s;he owed
to the children of the fir&s;t."</P>
<P>"You do not then believe," &s;aid Ce|le&s;tina
eagerly&mdash;"you do not then believe,
my dear Madam, that there is any truth in
this odious &s;tory?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me," an&s;wered Lady Horatia;
"I did not &s;ay &s;o."</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven!" exclaimed Cele&s;|tina,
"is it po&s;&s;ible you can believe it."</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="207">
"My dear young friend," &s;aid &s;he
calmly, "I have lived &s;o long in the
world, that though I do not ha&s;tily and on
&s;light grounds believe &s;uch a report, yet I
&s;hould not <HI>wonder</HI> were it in the event to be
verified."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who had always in her own
heart oppo&s;ed the idea of her being the
daughter of Mrs. Willoughby, though &s;he
felt and &s;ubmitted to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeing
Willoughby no more while one doubt re|mained
un&s;atisfied, now changed colour,
affected as well by the manner of Lady
Horatia as by what &s;he &s;aid. She had not,
however, courage to pre&s;s her farther, but
&s;poke of the vi&s;it intended her by Mr. Va|va&s;our&mdash;"I
wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid &s;he,
"to convince him at once that I &s;hall ne|ver
li&s;ten to the propo&s;al with which he is
plea&s;ed to honour me. As Willoughby's
friend," added &s;he, and &s;ighed, "I &s;hall
be always glad to &s;ee him; but, in any
other light, never&mdash;".</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="208">
"I think you wrong however," replied
Lady Horatia, "in wi&s;hing &s;o ha&s;tily to
di&s;mi&s;s him. He is a man of family, of
fortune, and, as you allow, not di&s;agreeable
in his per&s;on; and for his morals, they are not
wor&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, than tho&s;e of other young
men; he is allowed, I think, to be generous,
good tempered, and not to want &s;en&s;e. If
every idea of Willoughby is at an end,
why not relieve your&s;elf and him from a
&s;tate of unea&s;y retro&s;pection by receiving
the addre&s;&s;es of one whom he cannot di&s;|approve."</P>
<P>"Are you in earne&s;t, Lady Horatia?"
cried Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>"Certainly I am," replied &s;he: "at
lea&s;t, I venture very &s;eriou&s;ly to advi&s;e you
not to di&s;mi&s;s Vava&s;our &s;o ha&s;tily, but re|ceive
him as an acquaintance till you are
&s;ure you di&s;approve of him as a lover."</P>
<P>"Dear Madam!" re&s;umed Cele&s;tina,
"were I capable of giving away my hand
&s;o lightly, is Mr. Vava&s;our a man who you
think could make me happy?"</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="209">
"Nay," replied Lady Horatia, "if
there is any body whom you prefer that is
another point: I only &s;ay, that if you feel
your&s;elf perfectly di&s;engaged, I cannot
think Vava&s;our ought to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
ha&s;tily. Perhaps half the young women in
London would think a more de&s;irable match
could not offer."</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation was interrupted by
the entrance of a &s;ervant, who announced
the arrival of the per&s;on who was the &s;ub|ject
of it; and Vava&s;our immediately en|tered
the room.</P>
<P>He conde&s;cended to pay to Lady Hora|tia
more re&s;pect than he generally &s;hewed
to tho&s;e who were indifferent to him. Hers
was, however, that &s;ort of company in
which he by no means found him&s;elf at
ca&s;e; and his eagerne&s;s to entertain Cele&s;|tina
alone, once or twice broke through
the re&s;traint which he impo&s;ed upon him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia, who was candid and li|beral,
&s;aw in him only an unformed and un|&s;teady
<PB N="200" REF="210">
young man, who&s;e morals and man|ners
required nothing but time and good
company to render e&s;timable. She &s;aw the
prejudice Cele&s;tina &s;eemed to entertain to|wards
him, as a mere prejudice; and on
his ri&s;ing to depart, gave him a general in|vitation
to her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who knew the refinement of
her mind, and the delicacy of her ta&s;te, was
amazed at her &s;eeming to approve him;
and when he was gone, ventured to &s;ay&mdash;"What
does your Lady&s;hip think of Mr.
Vava&s;our?"</P>
<P>"Why really very well," replied &s;he.
"He is very young, and quite unformed;
but with tho&s;e giddy manners, and amid
that unpoli&s;hed conver&s;ation, there is no
want of under&s;tanding."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina again &s;ighed. "No," an|&s;wered
&s;he, "no want of under&s;tanding
certainly; for Willoughby was not likely
to &s;elect him for his friend had that been
wanting: but yet they were &s;o unlike&mdash;&s;o
very unlike&mdash;that I have often wondered at
<PB N="201" REF="211">
their long and intimate friend&s;hip. Vava|&s;our
is &s;o head long, &s;o impetuous, &s;o &s;elf|willed,
and &s;ometimes &s;o boi&s;terous, while
Willoughby, with more imagination, more
genius, more &s;trength of under&s;tanding, is
&s;o calm, &s;o rea&s;onable, &s;o attentive to every
body&mdash;"</P>
<P>She was too much affected to proceed in
the catalogue of his virtues, a &s;ubject on
which &s;he had hardly ever touched before;
but &s;topped, from the emotion &s;he felt;
and Lady Horatia, who &s;aw and pitied the
&s;ource of that emotion, changed the con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, flattered by the reception he
had met with from the pre&s;ent protectre&s;s
of Cele&s;tina, and more in love than ever
in proportion as &s;he was in his opinion in|finitely
hand&s;omer now than ever, was
now very frequent in his vi&s;its; while Ce|le&s;tina's
whole mind was occupied by the
nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was under of writing to Wil|loughby,
and the difficulty &s;he was under
how to an&s;wer with propriety &s;uch a letter
<PB N="202" REF="212">
as that &s;he had received from him. At
length, with many efforts, and more tears,
the letter was written and approved of by
Lady Horatia; and Cele&s;tina endeavoured,
in compliance with the wi&s;hes of her friend,
and with more earne&s;tne&s;s than &s;ucce&s;s, to
di&s;mi&s;s from her mind &s;ome of its corro&s;ive
&s;en&s;ations, and to enter, if not with avidity,
at lea&s;t with cheerfulne&s;s, into that &s;tyle of
fa&s;hionable life, which, though &s;he could
not always enjoy, &s;he never failed to adorn.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="203" REF="213">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>VAVASOUR had been with her every
day &s;ince her arrival in town, which was
almo&s;t a week, and Montague Thorold had
never appeared. While Cele&s;tina at once
wondered at his ab&s;ence and rejoiced at it,
(though perhaps her &s;en&s;ations were min|gled
with a &s;light degree of mortification,)
for while &s;he di&s;dained every &s;pecies of co|quetry,
&s;he yet felt humiliated by the &s;ud|den
ce&s;&s;ation of that attachment which he
had taken &s;uch pains to convince her, could
not be de&s;troyed even by de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Impatience, however, to hear of Wil|loughby,
was &s;till predominant in her
mind : and for this purpo&s;e &s;he wi&s;hed to
&s;ee Lady Molyneux. No acquaintance
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her and Lady Horatia;
<PB N="204" REF="214">
and therefore &s;he determined to write and
beg leave to wait on her old friend. This
&s;he executed in a note to the following
purport:</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s de Mornay being in town for a
&s;hort time, &s;olicits permi&s;&s;ion to wait
on Lady Molyneux at any time when
her Lady&s;hip may be di&s;engaged."</P>
<P>This note was delivered to Lady Moly|neux
in company. She read it, and as if
&s;he had forgotten totally the claim Cele&s;tina
had upon her from their having been
brought up together, and from her mother's
fondne&s;s for her, &s;he a&s;ked carele&s;sly whe|ther
the me&s;&s;enger waited for an an&s;wer;
the &s;ervant replied, that he did. Lady Mo|lyneux
had formed an idea that Cele&s;tina,
of whom &s;he had not thought for many
months, was now wandering about the
world in a dependent and inferior &s;ituation,
and might perhaps expect an invitation to
&s;tay with her, which &s;he had no inclination
<PB N="205" REF="215">
to give; &s;he therefore in a cold and care|le&s;s
way bade the footman tell the per&s;on
who brought the me&s;&s;age, that being then
engaged with company &s;he could not write
an an&s;wer, but would take an opportunity
of letting Mi&s;s de Mornay know when &s;he
&s;hould be at home. She then entered again
into conver&s;ation with her gue&s;ts; and it
was not till the next day that &s;he remem|bered
having heard from Cele&s;tina at all;
when &s;eeing the note on her table as &s;he
was going to dre&s;s for the opera, &s;he gave
it to her maid, and bade her put her in
mind to &s;end an an&s;wer to it and fix the
fir&s;t morning &s;he &s;hould be di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina in the mean time received the
verbal an&s;wer to her note with more con|cern
than &s;urpri&s;e. She had not expected
much kindne&s;s from Matilda, who during
&s;o many months had never once written to,
or enquired after her; but &s;he could not
without internal angui&s;h reflect that it was
the daughter of her more than mother, the
friend of her orphan youth, and the &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="206" REF="216">
of Willoughby, who was thus in&s;en&s;ible of
all tho&s;e feelings which &s;welled her heart
when the &s;cenes of that orphan youth, and
the plea&s;ures of that infantine friend&s;hip,
were remembered.</P>
<P>Amid the&s;e painful reflections, however,
there was one that gave her &s;ome degree of
con&s;olation. She thought that Lady Mo|lyneux
could not, either from any know|ledge
of her own, or from the reports
&s;pread by Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, believe that
any relation&s;hip by blood &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between
them; for &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be impo&s;&s;ible
for her in that ca&s;e to treat with &s;o much
cold neglect a per&s;on whom &s;he knew to be
her &s;i&s;ter. On this, therefore, &s;he dwelt,
as a circum&s;tance favourable to the notion
&s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed to entertain ; and as two
or three days pa&s;&s;ed on without her hearing
from Lady Molyneux, her eagerne&s;s to
enquire of her &s;ub&s;ided into a &s;trong belief
that &s;he knew nothing.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attended every day
at the hou&s;e of Lady Horatia during this
<PB N="207" REF="217">
interval, and contrived to obtain for him|&s;elf
&s;ome degree of intere&s;t in her favour.
The openne&s;s and candour of his temper,
was with her an apology for half his faults;
while his youth and natural vivacity ob|tained
his pardon for the re&s;t. His fortune
was &s;plendid, and his family ancient and
re&s;pectable; while his per&s;on was &s;uch as
could hardly fail to plea&s;e; and his man|ners,
carele&s;s and wild as they were, ap|peared
to advantage in the eyes of Lady
Horatia; who had been di&s;gu&s;ted by the
coldne&s;s and apathy, either real or affected,
of many of tho&s;e young men of fa&s;hion
who frequented her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On Cele&s;tina, however, the frequent op|portunities
&s;he had of ob&s;erving Vava&s;our,
had a very oppo&s;ite effect. In <HI>her</HI> mind
a &s;tandard of perfection had been early
formed, and every man &s;he now &s;aw was
plea&s;ing or otherwi&s;e as they re&s;embled or
differed from Willoughby. She continued
therefore to treat Vava&s;our with encrea&s;ing
coldne&s;s and &s;aw with concern that Lady
<PB N="208" REF="218">
Horatia was every day more &s;olicitous for
his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Willoughby, in the mean time, conti|nued
to wander about Europe without any
fixed plan, and merely flying from him&s;elf.
Still anxious to gather information on the
&s;ubject which had de&s;troyed all the happi|ne&s;s
of his life, and having little hopes of
obtaining any but by means of Lady Ca&s;|tlenorth,
he often conquered his reluctance,
and vi&s;ited his uncle at a villa he now inha|bited
near Naples; where he was always
received with plea&s;ure, and where, &s;ave
only on the point which alone intere&s;ted
him, Lady Ca&s;tlenorth &s;eemed to de&s;cend
from her natural character, to endeavour
by every means in her power to gratify
and oblige him: and her lord, who really
loved his nephew as much as his imbecility
of mind allowed him to love any body,
and who &s;aw in him and in his alliance
with his daughter, the only chance of per|petuating
a family which was the great ob|ject
of his pride, became hourly more ea|ger
<PB N="209" REF="219">
to &s;ee him, and more gratified by his
company.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that there are two
rea&s;ons which equally operate in determin|ing
&s;ome people to marry&mdash;love and ha|tred;
and &s;omething re&s;embling both the&s;e
&s;entiments agitated the heart of Mi&s;s Fitz|Hayman.
Of an involuntary preference to
her cou&s;in, &s;he had been &s;en&s;ible from the
fir&s;t moment &s;he &s;aw him; and his indif|ference,
his preference of Cele&s;tina, and
even his po&s;itively declining the honour of
her hand, had mortified without curing her
of her partiality; though re&s;entment and
di&s;dain were mingled with the inclination
&s;he could not conquer, and which neither
his ab&s;ence nor his coldne&s;s. had prevented
from gaining on her heart. When &s;he &s;aw
him again, new force was given to this
pa&s;&s;ion: he was le&s;s hand&s;ome, le&s;s ani|mated;
but more intere&s;ting and more
plea&s;ing; while his melancholy and dejec|tion,
though created by another object,
gave him &s;o many charms in the opinion
<PB N="210" REF="220">
of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, that her pride
yielded to them; and as it was now very
certain that he had no attachment but to
Cele&s;tina, whom, &s;ince &s;he fully believed
their relation&s;hip, &s;he knew he never could
marry, &s;he doubted not of being able to
in&s;pire him with an affection for her, and,
in returning to England his wife, of ful|filling
at once her parents wi&s;hes and her
own.</P>
<P>Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, who&s;e love of intrigue
time had by no means dimini&s;hed, and
who&s;e arrogance had been deeply wounded
by the failure of her original plan, which
&s;he fancied Willoughby would with &s;o
much eagerne&s;s have embraced, was now
doubly anxious to avail her&s;elf of the ad|vantage
&s;he had gained by having pre|vented
the intended union of Willoughby
and Cele&s;tina. Pique and re&s;entment ope|rated
upon her mind with even more force
than attachment and regard would have on
another. Be&s;ides, in the marriage of her
daughter with any man of &s;uperior rank
<PB N="211" REF="221">
and independent fortune, &s;he found great
probability that her influence would be le&s;|&s;ened
and her government di&s;claimed; but
in uniting her daughter with Willoughby,
who&s;e fortune was in di&s;order and who&s;e
temper was remarkably ea&s;y, &s;he fore&s;aw
the continuation of her power, and that &s;he
&s;hould neither &s;ee her daughter take place
of her, or e&s;cape from her influence.</P>
<P>Whatever was the wi&s;h of her friends,
the a&s;&s;iduous Mrs. Calder officiou&s;ly
adopted; and when &s;he found how much
Lord Ca&s;tlenorth had &s;et his heart on con|cluding
the marriage between his daugh|ter
and her nephew, &s;he applied all her
rhetoric to prove its advantages, and all her
art to &s;ecure it's &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Willoughby was uncon&s;cious of the plans
that were thus forming in the family of his
uncle, and did not think it po&s;&s;ible that
their pride would allow them to &s;olicit again
an alliance which he had once declined:
he therefore went to them without any ap|prehen&s;ion
that he was encouraging ex|pectations
<PB N="212" REF="222">
he never meant to fulfil, and
had indeed no other de&s;ign than to lay in
wait for traces of that involved my&s;tery,
which he &s;till thought had been created by
the intrigues and machinations of Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth.</P>
<P>In art, however, &s;he was &s;o much his
&s;uperior, that the very means he adopted
to obtain &s;atisfaction, was, in her hands, a
means of bewildering more deeply. She
now affected the mo&s;t perfect candour; and
whenever &s;he &s;aw him touching with a ten|der
hand on the &s;ubject, &s;he appeared to
feel for his unea&s;ine&s;s, and ready to give
him every &s;atisfaction in her power.</P>
<P>Willing to avail him&s;elf of this apparent
di&s;po&s;ition in his favour, he one day, when
he was &s;itting alone with Lady Ca&s;tlenorth,
a&s;ked her, whether &s;he had now no traces
of Hannah Bi&s;coe, the &s;ervant who alone
&s;eemed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the circum&s;tances into
which he mo&s;t wi&s;hed to enquire. Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth an&s;wered with great apparent
ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;he did not exactly
<PB N="213" REF="223">
know, as &s;he had no connection at all with
her, but that if he wi&s;hed to make any en|quiry,
her woman &s;hould write out the di|rections
to her relations, which &s;he did not
her&s;elf recollect.</P>
<P>Willoughby eagerly &s;eized on this offer,
and begged that the&s;e directions might be
immediately written out for him. Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth in&s;tantly called her woman,
and que&s;tioned her as to her recollection of
the abode of the relations of this Hannah
Bi&s;coe; the woman named what &s;he knew;
her lady directed her to put it down, and
Willoughby left the hou&s;e, flattering him|&s;elf
that he had at length obtained a clue
which might lead him to e&s;cape from the
labyrinth of error and mi&s;take where he
had &s;o &s;everely &s;uffered.</P>
<P>It was, however, by no means Lady
Ca&s;tlenorth's plan to &s;uffer Willoughby to
return to England in &s;earch of this woman,
who&s;e direction &s;he &s;eemed &s;o willing to
give him; and as from the eagerne&s;s and
agitation he expre&s;&s;ed on receiving this pa|per,
<PB N="214" REF="224">
it appeared but too likely that he me|ditated
going him&s;elf, in order to preclude
the po&s;&s;ibility of his views being again
fru&s;trated, &s;he found that all her art would
be nece&s;&s;ary to prevent his e&s;caping her.</P>
<P>Fortunately for her views, Lord Ca&s;tle|north
was &s;eized a few hours afterwards
with one of tho&s;e illne&s;&s;es which had &s;o of|ten
reduced him to the brink of the grave;
and the pre&s;ence of his nephew, which he
&s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, the generous and feel|ing
heart of Willoughby could not deny;
while he endured the cruelle&s;t re&s;traint in
&s;taying, and thought every hour an age
till he could go him&s;elf to England, and
renew his hitherto hopele&s;s re&s;earch after
the real &s;ituation of Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed, however, a month after the
arrival of Cele&s;tina in London; and then
the arrival of an Engli&s;h gentleman at Na|ples
brought him her letter, written in an|&s;wer
to that &s;he received at York. Nothing
could equal the impatience with which he
had expected this letter, but the pain he
<PB N="215" REF="225">
felt at reading it. He learned by it that
&s;he was returning to London, where he fan|cied
&s;o many objects would combine to
&s;often her concern for their &s;eparation;
and he fancied the letter expre&s;&s;ed too
much calmne&s;s, and that &s;he &s;ubmitted to
the &s;eparation which he had him&s;elf indi|cated
as too likely to be inevitable without
feeling half that regret and angui&s;h which
he expected &s;he would have de&s;cribed.
The reluctance &s;he expre&s;&s;ed to be left to
the protection of Vava&s;our, made him be|lieve
his pre&s;ence interfered with her pre|ference
to &s;ome other per&s;on&mdash;a preference,
of which the very &s;u&s;picion threw him into
agonies at the very moment his rea&s;on
told him that he ought not to think of her
for him&s;elf. Jealou&s;y now added to the
pangs of di&s;appointed love, and the letter
which Cele&s;tina had endeavoured to word
&s;o as to calm and &s;ooth him, and to teach
him to &s;ubmit to that nece&s;&s;ity of which he
allowed the force, &s;eemed to him to
breathe only indifference, and to prove that
<PB N="216" REF="226">
&s;he &s;aw him, without regret, relinqui&s;h his
claim to tho&s;e affections, which were al|ready
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another.</P>
<P>All his &s;ufferings were confirmed and
encrea&s;ed, when a day or two afterwards
he had an opportunity of conver&s;ing with
Mr. Jarvis, the gentleman who brought
the letter, and who was ha&s;tening to Rome.
He had been often in company with Cele&s;|tina
at parties where &s;he attended Lady
Horatia Howard; and believing, as all the
world now did, that Willoughby was cer|tainly
to be married to Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman;
and that the marriage of Cele&s;tina would be
a &s;ubject of &s;atisfaction to him, he related
without he&s;itation the reports he had heard
of her being &s;oon to give her hand to Mr.
Vava&s;our.</P>
<P>To the amazement Willoughby expre&s;&s;ed
at the fir&s;t intimation of &s;uch a match, Jar|vis,
who entirely mi&s;took it's cau&s;e, &s;aid&mdash;"Yes,
it is wonderful to be &s;ure, con&s;ider|ing
all we know of Vava&s;our, that he &s;hould
&s;eriou&s;ly intend to marry."</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="227">
So acute was the pain which the intelli|gence
Willoughby had ju&s;t received gave
him, that he could make no an&s;wer to this;
and Jarvis fancying him out of &s;pirits for
&s;ome rea&s;on or other which he never
thought of enquiring after, &s;oon after left
him to meditate on what he had heard.</P>
<P>There was "room for meditation even
"to madne&s;s," when he recollected a thou|&s;and
circum&s;tances that had till now ap|peared
of no moment; he was convinced
that Vava&s;our had long admired Cele&s;tina;
he had him&s;elf re&s;igned her, or at lea&s;t in|timated
that he dared not think of her;
and the per&s;on, the fortune, the impetuous
ardour of Vava&s;our, which his agitated
mind repre&s;ented as irre&s;i&s;tible, now all
crouded on his recollection, and he doubted
not but that before he could reach England,
Cele&s;tina would have given her&s;elf away.</P>
<P>Yet with the horrid my&s;tery unremoved,
on what pretence could he wi&s;h or even
think of impeding a marriage with a man
of whom his regard was evinced by his long
<PB N="218" REF="228">
friend&s;hip, and who had &s;o affluent a for|tune.
As a lover, he could him&s;elf no
longer interfere; as her relation, he could
not bear to con&s;ider him&s;elf; and were he
only &s;uch, an alliance with Vava&s;our could
not be objected to on any rea&s;onable
grounds.</P>
<P>The longer he reflected, therefore, on
what he had heard, the more unable he
became to &s;upport his reflections; and they
concluded in a re&s;olution to &s;et out imme|diately
for England; a determination which
he communicated to his uncle the &s;ame
day, who was affected by it even to tears.</P>
<P>Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had, in conver&s;ation
with Mr. Jarvis, heard the report of Cele&s;|tina's
intended marriage, and knew imme|diately
how to account for the extreme un|ea&s;ine&s;s
Willoughby betrayed, and his
&s;udden re&s;olution to depart for England.
When Jarvis, who proceeded immediately
on his journey, was gone, &s;he found an
opportunity a few hours afterwards to &s;peak
to Willoughby on Engli&s;h news, and the
<PB N="219" REF="229">
change of his countenance confirmed her
conjectures. This was an occa&s;ion not to
be lo&s;t; &s;he ventured, what &s;he u&s;ually
avoided, to name Cele&s;tina, and to expre&s;s
her &s;atisfaction that &s;he was likely to be &s;o
well married. "After all the conver&s;ation
there has been about this young per&s;on,"
&s;aid &s;he, affecting to have a great deal of
feeling for her, "I am very glad that the
poor girl will be &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed. A man
of Vava&s;our's independent fortune can well
afford to plea&s;e him&s;elf; and I doubt not
but that you and Lady Molyneux mu&s;t on
every account rejoice at her change of
name, and that nothing more will be &s;aid
of her origin." Though Lady Ca&s;tlenorth
affected to &s;peak with &s;entiment, and to
&s;o&s;ten her voice, her piercing and en|quiring
eyes were demanding from the
countenance of Willoughby that explana|tion
which &s;he knew it would give of his
real &s;entiments; and &s;he &s;aw the blood for|&s;ake
his cheeks, his lips turn white and
tremble, and a mingled expre&s;&s;ion of doubt,
<PB N="220" REF="230">
fear, anger, and di&s;dain, marked on his fea|tures.
"If I were certain, Madam," &s;aid
he, "that all the odious reports, on which
<HI>you,</HI> who fir&s;t promulgated them, have in|variably
refu&s;ed to &s;atisfy me as you might
do&mdash;if I were &s;ure they were all true&mdash;"</P>
<P>"If!" interrupted Lady Ca&s;tlenorth:
"can you then doubt their truth? Will
you compel me to make, by adducing
tho&s;e proofs, a matter public which you
ought on every account to wi&s;h might be
buried in eternal oblivion?"</P>
<P>"Will I compel you, Madam! Yes
&s;urely I will if the means are in my power.
'Tis for this only I have been &s;o much with
you; not to compel you indeed, but in
the hope of prevailing upon you, if you
really po&s;&s;e&s;s the evidence you have often
meditated, to give it me all without re|&s;erve."</P>
<P>"Well," cried Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, "I
have now given you a direction to the only
per&s;on who is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this evidence.
You might have procured it as long &s;ince as
when I interfered to &s;ave you from the hor|rors
<PB N="221" REF="231">
of a marriage which mu&s;t have ren|dered
you and the object of your unhappily
placed affection mi&s;erable for ever: but
then you flew from me, and re&s;ented my
friend&s;hip as if it had been an injury.
Since that time it is not my fault if you
have been unable to find this per&s;on, whom
I have never &s;ecreted, and of whom I know
little or nothing. Satisfied in having &s;aved
you from an aby&s;s of guilt and mi&s;ery, I
tru&s;ted to time and your own principles to
convince you of the inju&s;tice your &s;u&s;picions
did me. You have &s;earched for proo&s;s in
tho&s;e places where your mother is &s;aid to
have been with her young charge: tell me,
have you ever found any rea&s;on to believe
the facts I told you of to be of my inven|tion&mdash;to
have been totally unfounded?"</P>
<P>Willoughby was con&s;cious he had not;
yet at the &s;ame moment he di&s;covered that
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had watched him, and
knew of the journies he had made to Hieres
and to other places. Vexed and angry,
not knowing what to think, or whether he
<PB N="222" REF="232">
was impo&s;ed on by her &s;uperior cunning,
or was needle&s;sly tormenting him&s;elf in
pu&s;hing the enquiry farther, he could not
command the various unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations
with which he was agitated; and therefore
abruptly leaving the room, he ha&s;tened to
his lodgings, and gave directions for his
immediate departure for England.</P>
<P>He was concerned, however, for his un|cle,
and returned in the evening to take
leave of him: he found him &s;itting with
Mrs. Calder, who was reading to him a
&s;ort of <HI>catalogue rai&s;onn&eacute;e</HI> of the various ills
to which the human body is &s;ubject; and as
they pa&s;&s;ed in melancholy review before
him, he &s;topped her to. con&s;ult her on his
own &s;ymptoms, and to enquire of her whe|ther
&s;he did not think &s;uch and &s;uch com|plaints
were about to add to his bodily in|firmities.
Mrs. Calder, who was always
obliged to every body who fancied her
&s;kill enabled her to an&s;wer &s;uch que&s;tions,
was delighted with the opportunity this af|forded
her of exhibiting her knowledge to
<PB N="223" REF="233">
Willoughby, from whom &s;he could never
procure the &s;malle&s;t voluntary attention;
and the conver&s;ation became &s;o irk&s;ome,
that having waited near an hour, and &s;ee|ing
it not likely to end, Willoughby at
length &s;tarted up and approached to take
his uncle's hand, when Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
in all the languor of unhappy love, &s;wam
into the room.</P>
<P>On her entrance, Willoughby &s;at down
again, as being unwilling to have her
&s;uppo&s;e he rudely fled from her approach.
She put on an air of affected humility, and
looked as if &s;he thanked him for even this
&s;light mark of attention. She gave a loud
and deep &s;igh, prolonged as much as po&s;|&s;ible;
her eyes, robbed of their fire, were
turned mournfully upon him&mdash;"You are
going from us, Mr. Willoughby?" &s;aid
&s;he, in a &s;ubdued and faint voice.</P>
<P>He replied, that bu&s;ine&s;s, which could
not longer be delayed, made his return to
England nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="234">
Another deep &s;igh was all the lady's an|&s;wer
to this information: but Lord Ca&s;tle|north
cried&mdash;"I am &s;orry to hear you &s;ay
&s;o, George&mdash;very &s;orry. I did hope that
we might have all returned together as &s;oon
as my complaints &s;ub&s;ide a little. As to
bu&s;ine&s;s, you ought to remember that all
your money matters might be ea&s;ily &s;ettled
if you plea&s;ed."</P>
<P>"I thank you, Sir," replied Willough|by,
who &s;aw whither the di&s;cour&s;e would
tend; "but tho&s;e matters are the lea&s;t of
my concern."</P>
<P>"Stay, however, one day," &s;aid Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth, "that you may execute &s;ome
bu&s;ine&s;s for me. Surely, nephew, you will
oblige me &s;o far."</P>
<P>Though every hour's delay was death to
him, he at length agreed, on his uncle's
repeated entreaties, to &s;tay four and twenty
hours longer at Naples; and then leaving
the room, he was followed by the officious
Mrs. Calder, who de&s;iring leave to &s;ay half
<PB N="225" REF="235">
a dozen words to him alone, he &s;uffered
her to &s;hew him into another room.</P>
<P>She put on a mo&s;t rueful countenance,
&s;troked her handkerchief, plaited her ruf|fles,
and uttering an "oh dear!" between
a &s;igh and a groan, &s;he continued thus&mdash;"My
dear good Sir! I wi&s;h to have a lit|tle
conver&s;ation relative to your &s;ituation in
this dear worthy family, for every member
of which my poor heart bleeds."</P>
<P>"And yet, Madam," interrupted Wil|loughby
impatiently, "there is, perhaps,
hardly a family among your acquaintance
who are, in the opinion of the world, &s;o little
objects of compa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"The world!" exclaimed the lady.
"Lord ble&s;s me, what &s;ignifies the opinion
of the world. The world cannot &s;ee as I
do into all their feelings. There's your
mo&s;t excellent uncle, as worthy a man as
ever exi&s;ted, &s;inking, poor good dear
man! under five complaints, all incurable,
and denied, alas! the only &s;atisfaction this
world has to give him&mdash;&s;eeing his darling
<PB N="226" REF="236">
daughter &s;ettled to his wi&s;hes, which would
&s;mooth his path to heaven, and leave him
nothing but bodily pain&mdash;which is &s;evere
enough&mdash;nothing but bodily pain, as I ob|&s;erved,
to contend with. Oh! Sir, what
heart felt &s;atisfaction it mu&s;t be to you!
what comfortable reflection for a good heart,
&s;uch as inhabits your brea&s;t no doubt&mdash;I
&s;ay, what delight it would be to you, to
hold forth the amiable hand that &s;hould&mdash;
<Q>Rock the cradle of repo&s;ing age,</Q>
and &s;ooth the latter days of &s;o excellent
and worthy an uncle."</P>
<P>The whine, and the hypocritical gri|mace
with which this &s;peech was delivered,
would have conquered the gravity of Wil|loughby
at any other time: but he now
felt his di&s;gu&s;t irritated by impatience,
amounting almo&s;t to rage; but he repre&s;&s;ed
his feelings with difficulty, unwilling by
oppo&s;ition to lengthen the conver&s;ation,
which Mrs. Calder &s;uffered not to langui&s;h,
but thus went on&mdash;"Ah dear! what a me|lancholy
<PB N="227" REF="237">
reflection, as I ob&s;erved, it is, to
con&s;ider, that, poor good man, this is not
likely to happen; and in&s;tead of it, this
darling daughter, this fine young woman,
heire&s;s to &s;uch a noble fortune, &s;o beauti|ful,
&s;o accompli&s;hed, &s;o elegant&mdash;undenia|bly
the fir&s;t match in England in point of
rank and beauty and fortune&mdash;&s;o lovely in
per&s;on, &s;o amiable in mind, &s;o elevated in
under&s;tanding&mdash;far, alas! from being happy,
&s;ees her youth pa&s;s away in a hopele&s;s pa&s;|&s;ion,
which from her infancy &s;he has been
taught to cheri&s;h, and which now her rea|&s;on,
aided by her affronted pride, tries in
vain to repre&s;s. Oh! Mr. Willoughby!
Mr. Willoughby! the happine&s;s that you
refu&s;e, by how many would be courted!
The heart that you di&s;dain to accept, by
how many would be adored! Dear crea|ture!
when I &s;ee how thin &s;he is grown,
and know the cau&s;e of it &s;o well!&mdash;when I
hear her &s;igh, and know how injurious it is
to her dear delicate con&s;titution, I really
Sir&mdash;you will forgive my zeal&mdash;have looked
<PB N="228" REF="238">
upon you with amazement, and have a&s;ked
my&s;elf whether you have eyes&mdash;whether
you have a heart&mdash;"</P>
<P>"To what, Madam," interrupted Wil|loughby,
who could no longer endure her
harangue patiently&mdash;"to what does all this
tend?"</P>
<P>"Tend, dear Sir!" replied Mrs. Calder;
"why certainly to open your eyes if po&s;&s;i|ble
to a &s;en&s;e of the happine&s;s you are throw|ing
away; to prevail on you to an&s;wer the
expectations of all your friends, to con&s;ult
your own intere&s;t, and to become all you
ought to be."</P>
<P>"You mean well, I conclude, Madam,"
an&s;wered Willoughby, "by all this; but
you mi&s;take greatly, when you &s;uppo&s;e
that the alliance to which you allude would
contribute to the happine&s;s of any of the
parties for whom you are intere&s;ted. I
have no heart to offer Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman;
and if the partiality which you repre&s;ent
exi&s;ts any where but in your own imagina|tion,
it would be ungenerous to encou|rage
<PB N="229" REF="239">
and unworthy to avail my&s;elf of it,
feeling as I do that I never can an&s;wer it
as I am very willing to allow the young
lady's merits de&s;erve: excu&s;e me, there|fore,
if I entreat of you never to con&s;ider
me as being likely to be more clo&s;ely united
with the family of Lord Ca&s;tlenorth than I
at pre&s;ent am, and to declare to you, that
by per&s;i&s;ting in pre&s;&s;ing it, my uncle will
put it out of my power to te&s;tify for him
that regard and affection which I really
feel."</P>
<P>Willoughby then left the room; and
Mrs. Calder, piqued and mortified at the
little &s;ucce&s;s of her rhetoric, went reluc|tantly
to give an account to Lady Ca&s;tle|north,
by whom &s;he had been employed,
of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of her emba&s;&s;y.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>WILLOUGHBY, notwith&s;tanding
every effort and every art made u&s;e of to
detain him, pur&s;ued his way to England:
but at Paris, the fatigue he had undergone,
and the anxiety which had &s;o long weighed
on his &s;pirits, combined to throw him into
one of tho&s;e fevers, to which, from his in|fancy,
he had been &s;ubject; and for three
weeks he was in the mo&s;t imminent dan|ger.
Amid the wild ravings of the delirium
that perpetually occurred during the &s;eve|re&s;t
paroxy&s;ms of the complaint, he called
ince&s;&s;antly on Cele&s;tina; and complaining
that Lady Ca&s;tlenorth had taken her from
him, entreated of his &s;ervant, a man who
had lived with him for &s;ome years, to &s;end
for her that he might &s;ee her before he died.
<PB N="231" REF="241">
This, in the &s;implicity of his heart, his faith|ful
attendant would have done, having no
idea that any thing could be of more con&s;e|quence
than the wi&s;hes of his dear ma&s;ter,
for who&s;e life he was &s;o cruelly alarmed;
but when he a&s;ked him whither he was to
&s;end, Willoughby put his hand on his
heart, &s;ighed deeply, and replied, either
that he did not know or that it would be of
no effect; for that, indifferent what be|came
of him, &s;he had already refu&s;ed to
come to him, and was gone to Scotland
with Vava&s;our.</P>
<P>When the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ub&s;ided,
he cea&s;ed to name her; and his &s;ervant,
afraid of renewing his recollection, care|fully
avoided any hint of what he had
dwelt upon during his delirious ravings.
Slowly, and with two relap&s;es, he recovered
&s;trength enough to proceed to Calais; but
nine weeks had elap&s;ed &s;ince the informa|tion
he had received from Vava&s;our; and it
was near three months after that time before
he arrived in London.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="242">
His fir&s;t enquiry was after Vava&s;our,
who was, he found, in Stafford&s;hire; and
his heart was relieved by the intelligence,
for he dreaded lea&s;t he &s;hould have met
him in London, perhaps married to Cele&s;|tina.
His next was after his &s;i&s;ter, whom
he &s;till loved, and in favour of whom he
was willing to forget all the neglect he had
experienced from her, as well as the cau&s;es
of di&s;plea&s;ure given him by her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>After Cele&s;tina he feared to a&s;k by a di|rect
me&s;&s;age to her&s;elf, and he therefore
&s;ought &s;omebody who could tell where &s;he
now was, of which he concluded he &s;hould
have intelligence from Lady Molyneux.</P>
<P>Lady Molyneux attended his &s;ummons;
and while he embraced her, with tears of
fraternal fondne&s;s, from a thou&s;and tender
recollections that crouded on his heart, he
&s;aw her equally unmoved by their meet|ing
and unconcerned at his illne&s;s, of which
he &s;till retained melancholy proofs in his
altered countenance and reduced figure.
He took an early opportunity of turning
<PB N="233" REF="243">
the di&s;cour&s;e on Cele&s;tina; and &s;aw, with
encrea&s;ed amazement, that far from be|ing
intere&s;ted in the enquiry which had
occupied his whole thoughts &s;o long,
Matilda was perfectly indifferent about it,
or if he moved her a moment from the &s;till|ne&s;s
of fa&s;hionable apathy, &s;he &s;hrunk from
the &s;ubject with &s;omething like di&s;gu&s;t;
&s;eemed afraid of the trouble of inve&s;tiga|tion,
and carele&s;s how it might terminate;
wi&s;hing rather to hear nothing about it,
than to hazard&mdash;not the tarni&s;hing her mo|ther's
honour, for to that &s;he &s;eemed in|&s;en&s;ible,
but the probability of being obliged
to own for a &s;i&s;ter, one whom &s;he had
hitherto con&s;idered as a dependent; and
of &s;eeing her brother, from a point of ho|nour,
undertake to provide for her as a re|lation.
Avarice, the heterogeneous child
of &s;elfi&s;h vanity, was become a leading
feature in the character of Matilda: &s;he
found &s;o many u&s;es for money in adorning
and in indulging her&s;elf, that &s;he loved no|thing
&s;o well, except the adulation it pro|cured
<PB N="234" REF="244">
for her; and &s;o much power has this
odious pa&s;&s;ion to pervert the heart, that
in&s;tead of feeling concern in contemplating
the &s;unken features and palid cheek of her
brother, &s;he could not, nor indeed did &s;he
attempt to check, a half formed idea of the
pecuniary advantage &s;he &s;hould receive
from his death.</P>
<P>While &s;uch were her thoughts, Wil|loughby
a&s;ked her when &s;he had la&s;t &s;een
Cele&s;tina?</P>
<P>"Oh!" replied &s;he, "I have &s;een her
only once in a room, and that was by acci|dent.
I was never at home when &s;he called;
and I hate that old Lady Horatia Howard
that &s;he lives with, and &s;o took no great
pains to meet them when I returned her
vi&s;it. I have &s;een her though in public five
or &s;ix times lately, but the girl &s;eemed to
me &s;o very much altered, and to give her|&s;elf
&s;uch intolerable airs, that I rather
&s;hunned than &s;ought her.</P>
<P>"Airs!" cried Willoughby. "She mu&s;t
indeed be greatly changed if &s;he de&s;erves
<PB N="235" REF="245">
&s;uch cen&s;ure: but tell me, Matilda&mdash;what
kind of airs?"</P>
<P>"Oh! the airs of a beauty," an&s;wered
&s;he, "which you fir&s;t taught her to a&s;&s;ume,
and which &s;he has made a tolerable pro|gre&s;s
in, &s;ince this old cat of fa&s;hion has
taken it into her head to make &s;uch a fu&s;s
about her, and &s;ince &s;he has been &s;urrounded
with &s;uch a &s;et of &s;en&s;ele&s;s boys. There's
your friend Vava&s;our con&s;tantly one of her
&s;uit, and there was a notion of his being
fool enough to marry her, but I fancy that
was given out merely by her exorbitant
vanity, for I dare &s;ay Vava&s;our knows
better."</P>
<P>The heart of Willoughby &s;unk within
him; but he was unable to expre&s;s what he
felt; and Lady Molyneux went on&mdash;"However,
I have heard &s;ince, I think,
that the girl has been addre&s;&s;ed by another
young fellow&mdash;one of the Thorolds I
think&mdash;whom I have lately &s;een with her,
which would be more &s;uitable and more
likely to be a match."</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="246">
"You have &s;een her then often?" &s;aid
Willoughby, in a faint and faultering
voice.</P>
<P>"Yes, in public," replied his &s;i&s;ter;
"but I have had no conver&s;ation with her."
Lady Molyneux then changed the con|ver&s;ation,
and &s;oon afterwards left her bro|ther
more unhappy than &s;he had found him.</P>
<P>He was by no means able to &s;ee Cele&s;|tina
in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of wretched uncer|tainty:
yet to know that by traver&s;ing two
or three &s;treets he could once more behold
her, once more gaze on that lovely coun|tenance,
and hear that voice &s;o &s;oothing,
&s;o enchanting to his ears; was to him a &s;tate
of tantalizing mi&s;ery, from which he knew
nothing could relieve him but detecting
the fal&s;hood of Lady Ca&s;tlenorth's report;
and this he could only hope to do by ano|ther
journey into York&s;hire, in order to
find that Hannah Bi&s;coe to whom he now
thought he had certainly obtained a direc|tion,
and this he propo&s;ed doing immedi|ately.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="247">
Cele&s;tina, however, &s;urrounded by crouds
of admirers; Cele&s;tina, forgetting all the
tenderne&s;s &s;he once felt for him and render|ing
all his re&s;earches fruitle&s;s even if they
proved to him that he might again plead
for the renewal of that affection, was an
idea that uncea&s;ingly tormented him; and
&s;o painfully did the intelligence affect him
which Lady Molyneux had given, that the
ferment of his &s;pirits produced a return of
his fever; in a &s;lighter degree, but &s;till &s;o
as to confine him to his room; where, in a
few days, he received a vi&s;it from Vava&s;our.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our was totally uncon&s;cious of the
&s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s which Willoughby &s;uf|fered;
and &s;ince he him&s;elf had re&s;igned
her, and agreed to complete his engage|ments
with the family of Ca&s;tlenorth, for &s;o
his conduct had been generally under&s;tood
in England, had no notion that the ad|dre&s;&s;es
of another, and particularly of his
friend, could be otherwi&s;e than plea&s;ing to
him. He began, therefore, without re|marking
the concern and coldne&s;s of Wil|loughby,
<PB N="238" REF="248">
imputing it only to his vi&s;ibly
deranged health, to relate to him his own
views in regard to Cele&s;tina, and to com|plain
of her preference of Montague Tho|rold.
"The devil take me," &s;aid he, "if
there is in England or in Europe another
woman for whom I would take a fifth part
of the trouble which this bewitching girl
has already given me. Cur&s;e me if I am
not a&s;hamed of my&s;elf when I think what
a whining puppy &s;he has made of me; ten
times I have left her, and ten times have
returned, to prove to her that &s;he might
u&s;e me like a dog."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s de Mornay," &s;aid Willoughby,
in a voice affected by the various &s;en&s;ations
he felt&mdash;"Mi&s;s de Mornay mu&s;t be greatly
changed, Sir, if &s;he is become capable of
any improper levity towards any gentle|man
who profe&s;&s;es regard for her&punc; at the
&s;ame time you will recollect, Mr. Vava|&s;our,
that &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf, and at
liberty to reject tho&s;e who&s;e offers may not
be acceptable to her. From the experi|ments
<PB N="239" REF="249">
which you have been plea&s;ed to
make, (though from our long friend&s;hip I
&s;hould rather have expected you to have
applied to me before you made them)&mdash;from
the experiments you have been plea&s;ed
to make, it &s;eems clear that Mi&s;s De Mor|nay
has no favourable intentions towards
you, and I would advi&s;e you by all means
to decline the pur&s;uit."</P>
<P>"May I peri&s;h if I do!" replied Vava|&s;our,
with all his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity. "No,
George, unle&s;s it can be made to appear
that young Thorold&mdash;that little curatizing
fellow&mdash;without a &s;hilling, and with no|thing
but his impudence and &s;craps of plays
to recommend him, has better preten&s;ions
than I have, cur&s;e me if I will give it up!"</P>
<P>This &s;econd intimation of Cele&s;tina's en|couraging
the addre&s;&s;es of Montague Tho|rold,
was a &s;econd dagger in the &s;ick heart
of Willoughby. He dreaded an explana|tion,
which, while it might &s;erve perhaps
to &s;ubdue all his fears as to Vava&s;our,
might create others equally in&s;upportable.
<PB N="240" REF="250">
He could not, however, remain many mi|nutes
in the breathle&s;s agitation of &s;uch &s;u&s;|pence,
and therefore &s;aid&mdash;"I really don't
know any thing about Thorold. I hardly
recollect that there was &s;uch a man."</P>
<P>"What!" exclaimed Vava&s;our; "not
know him? Not know that &s;he went im|mediately
from Alve&s;tone to the hou&s;e of
that old prie&s;t his father."</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered Willoughby, "that
I certainly knew; for it was by my reque&s;t
that the elder Mr. Thorold became her
guardian."</P>
<P>"Well, nothing was &s;o natural, I &s;up|po&s;e,
as for his reverence to delegate the
tru&s;t to his &s;on; and as his deputy; I &s;up|po&s;e
it was, that he went with his ward to
Scotland, and was her guardian all the
time &s;he was among the highlands and the
i&s;lands."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" cried Willoughby. "He
did not&mdash;could not have been there."</P>
<P>"He was by heaven!" exclaimed Va|va&s;our;
"and when I met Cele&s;tina, with
<PB N="241" REF="251">
your letter, at York, I found that young
fellow attending on her and Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone:
but <HI>I</HI> was authori&s;ed by your&s;elf to
wait on her; and I obliged <HI>him</HI> there to re|&s;ign
a po&s;t, which, when I think of his
having &s;o long filled, and apparently with
her approbation, by all that's diabolical I
could tear his puritanical &s;oul out!"</P>
<P>Nothing that Willoughby had ever felt
was equal to the angui&s;h which pre&s;&s;ed on
his heart at this moment. The coldne&s;s
he fancied he had found in Cele&s;tina's la&s;t
letter was now accounted for; and all the
warmth of grateful prai&s;e, with which in
her former letters &s;he had &s;poken of Mr.
Thorold, was imputed to her growing af|fection
for his &s;on. Lo&s;t as &s;he might be,
and probably was to him for ever before
this intelligence, unle&s;s he could content
him&s;elf with that &s;hare of &s;i&s;terly affection
which was all &s;he ought to be&s;tow, there
was &s;omething &s;o terrible to his imagina|tion
in her feeling a warm attachment to
another, that he could not think of it with|out
<PB N="242" REF="252">
horror, nor conceal from Vava&s;our the
effect it had upon him. His mildne&s;s of
manners for&s;ook him; and &s;peaking le&s;s
like him&s;elf than like Vava&s;our, who&s;e ve|hemence
he &s;eemed to adopt, he cried, in
a voice that trembled with pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;"How
dared he pretend to Cele&s;tina!"</P>
<P>"He not only dared then," interrupted
Vava&s;our, "but dares &s;till; and has con|trived
to get Lady Horatia Howard to be
of his party. He has fa&s;cinated the old
woman with his piety and his poetry, and
I &s;ee very plainly that the young one will
throw her&s;elf away upon him unle&s;s you
prevent it."</P>
<P>"May I peri&s;h," cried he, "if I do
<HI>not!</HI>" Yet at that moment the recollection
too forcibly occurred to him that he had no
right to prevent it, unle&s;s by urging a claim
as her relation, from which his &s;oul recoiled.
So painfully acute were his pre&s;ent &s;en&s;a|tions,
that he was unable to breathe, and
without attending longer to the exhorta|tions
of Vava&s;ours who eagerly pre&s;&s;ed him
<PB N="243" REF="253">
to interfere immediately, he abruptly left
the room, and &s;ent by his &s;ervant a me&s;|&s;age
to Vava&s;our, &s;aying he found him&s;elf
&s;o ill that he was gone to bed; but &s;hould
be glad he would call again for an hour in
the evening.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, however, of attempting to pro|cure
that repo&s;e which his encrea&s;ed fever
required, he went to the trunk where Ce|le&s;tina's
letters were depo&s;ited, and with
trembling hands taking them out, he ran
them over, even from the fir&s;t &s;he wrote to
him after their &s;eparation, to the la&s;t which
Mr. Jarvis had delivered to him at Naples.</P>
<P>His apprehen&s;ive jealou&s;y &s;o powerfully
awakened, now taught him to fancy, that
from the moment of Cele&s;tina's acquaint|ance
with Montague Thorold, her letters
had become gradually cooller, and that
the la&s;t too plainly evinced her cheerful ac|quie&s;cence
to that reluctant and only con|ditional
re&s;ignation, which <HI>be</HI> had with &s;o
much angui&s;h of heart been compelled to
&s;end her, while he explained the cruel cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="244" REF="254">
that had torn him from her and
from happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The longer he dwelt on her letters, the
more this idea was &s;trengthened, and the
more in&s;upportable it became. His illne&s;s,
originally occa&s;ioned by anxiety, returned
upon him; and though without delirium,
his fever was nearly as high as when he was
in &s;o much danger at Paris.</P>
<P>He now determined to &s;end to Lady
Horatia Howard; and he attempted to
write to her. But he could hardly com|mand
his pen, and found him&s;elf wholly
unequal to the more difficult ta&s;k of com|po&s;ing
&s;uch a letter as could alone be pro|per.
He threw away the paper in de&s;pair;
and calling his &s;ervant, ordered him to
find out immediately &s;ome means of be|coming
acquainted with the &s;ervants of
Lady Horatia Howard, and procure intelli|gence
of what vi&s;itors were mo&s;t at the
hou&s;e, particularly if a Mr. Thorold of De|von&s;hire
was there often.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="255">
The man ha&s;tened to enter on a ta&s;k by
no means difficult to him. He contrived
the &s;ame afternoon to introduce him&s;elf to
one of the footmen of Lady Horatia at the
porter hou&s;e he frequented, and learned
that his mi&s;tre&s;s and her young friend, of
whom he &s;poke as of an angel, were gone
for a fortnight or three weeks on a vi&s;it into
Oxford&s;hire; that Mr. Vava&s;our u&s;ed to be
a good deal at the hou&s;e when fir&s;t Lady
Horatia came to town; that now he was
much le&s;s frequently there; but that Mr.
Thorold was there almo&s;t every day, and
read to the ladies whole evenings; who,
&s;ince the&s;e reading parties at home, went
much le&s;s into public than they had done
before.</P>
<P>This intelligence di&s;tracted Willoughby
by redoubling every apprehen&s;ion he had
felt. The man, however, was &s;ent back
for further information, and bade to a&s;k if
Mr. Thorold was of their party in their
pre&s;ent journey, and if there was any talk
<PB N="246" REF="256">
among the &s;ervants of an intended marriage
between him and Mi&s;s De Mornay.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e queries, he had the
mortification of hearing that Montague
Thorold was to meet the ladies at Oxford;
and that it was, in the family, generally
under&s;tood that he was the accepted lover
of Cele&s;tina, and highly approved by Lady
Horatia.</P>
<P>It was now that the corro&s;ive jealou&s;y
that had long tormented him had a decided
object, and fixed with the mo&s;t envenomed
power on the heart of Willoughby. The
impo&s;&s;ibility of his interfering, to prevent
Cele&s;tina giving her&s;elf to another while he
him&s;elf remained in &s;uch a &s;ituation as the
pre&s;ent, and dared not even &s;ee her; the
little probability he &s;aw of removing the
doubts that di&s;tracted him; and the appre|hen&s;ions
lea&s;t if they were for ever effectu|ally
withdrawn Cele&s;tina would rejoice that
they were &s;o; the cruel idea of Montague
Thorold's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that heart which he
once knew to be all his own, and the pre|ference
<PB N="247" REF="257">
of that elegant mind of which he
had with &s;o much delight contemplated the
improvement; were thoughts that ince&s;|&s;antly
pur&s;ued and tormented him: and he
had no means of obtaining any information
of the conduct of Cele&s;tina, or of her return
to town, but by his &s;ervant, who was now
employed whole days to gather from the do|me&s;tics
of Lady Horatia, intelligence,
which, when obtained, &s;erved only to en|crea&s;e
his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The anecdotes he gathered from his &s;i&s;ter
&s;erved too but to aggravate his di&s;tre&s;s: yet
when he &s;aw her, (as he generally did once
every day,) from whatever point the con|ver&s;ation
&s;at out, it always ended in que&s;tions
about Cele&s;tina: and Lady Molyneux,
who had in&s;en&s;ibly familiari&s;ed her mind to
the idea of her brother's dying a bachelor
in con&s;equence of his early di&s;appointment,
now &s;aw with concern that his attachment to
Cele&s;tina, though it prevented his marrying
any other, was yet &s;o rooted in his heart,
that &s;hould he find, as &s;he believed he
<PB N="248" REF="258">
would, the imagined relation&s;hip a mere
fiction, he would mo&s;t undoubtedly return
to her with more ardour than before they
were parted: and notwith&s;tanding the em|barra&s;&s;ed
&s;tate of his affairs, which every
day became more &s;erious, would marry her,
and di&s;appoint every view of fortune&mdash;en|crea&s;e
of fortune&mdash;which her avaricious am|bition
fore&s;aw might otherwi&s;e accrue to
her.</P>
<P>Actuated, therefore, by very different
motives, &s;he co-operated with Lady Ca&s;tle|north
in endeavouring to divide him from
Cele&s;tina; and while one was &s;trengthening
the barrier rai&s;ed between them, the other
was trying to convince Willoughby that he
ought not to wi&s;h for it's removal.</P>
<P>The means of doing this were, &s;he
thought, to keep him at a di&s;tance from
Cele&s;tina, and to pique his pride by repre|&s;enting
her as attached to another. The
fir&s;t point was for the pre&s;ent &s;ecured by his
illne&s;s; and &s;he took care &s;o artfully to in|&s;inuate
the &s;econd, that aided as &s;he was by
<PB N="249" REF="259">
the report of Vava&s;our, and by the conti|nual
repetitions of what he had &s;een on the
journey from Scotland, that every hour the
fatal impre&s;&s;ion &s;unk, deeper into his heart,
and his rea&s;on, or his reliance on Cele&s;tina's
affection, had not &s;ufficient power to re&s;i&s;t
it.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed five or &s;ix days after his ar|rival
in London. He endeavoured to &s;hake
off his illne&s;s; for by a journey into York|&s;hire,
which he could not till it was con|quered
undertake, he could alone hope to
obtain any &s;atisfaction as to the original
cau&s;e of their &s;eparation. Yet even from
thence he now no longer dared to look for|ward
to happine&s;s, which even while he
was employed in attempting to regain it,
&s;eemed e&s;caping from him for ever.</P>
<P>But that he might undertake &s;omething
to relieve him&s;elf from the wretched &s;tate
he was now in, he put him&s;elf into the care
of a phy&s;ician, and &s;et about getting out of
an illne&s;s he had hitherto neglected or ra|ther
indulged. Though very languid, and
<PB N="250" REF="260">
with a great deal of fever &s;till about him,
he went to Lady Molyneux's; and in a
day or two afterwards, as he found him&s;elf
better from change of &s;cene and of place,
he accompanied her on &s;ome of her vi&s;its,
and called in at a card party, where &s;he
told him &s;he mu&s;t &s;hew her&s;elf for a quarter
of an hour. The rooms were full; and
Lady Molyneux being, notwith&s;tanding her
declaration that &s;he &s;hould &s;tay &s;o &s;hort a
time, &s;et down to a card table, Willoughby
&s;auntered into one of the apartments where
the younger part of the company were
&s;eated at a commerce table; where the fir&s;t
per&s;on that met his eyes was Cele&s;tina, ele|gantly
dre&s;&s;ed and more beautiful than ever,
with myriads of charms playing round her
face, and cheerfulne&s;s and plea&s;ure dancing
in her eyes; while on one &s;ide &s;at a young
man whom Willoughby immediately recol|lected
to be Montague Thorold, and on
the other another gentleman, who, though
he &s;eemed to be more a &s;tranger to her, was
<PB N="251" REF="261">
evidently charmed with her, and unable to
keep his eyes from her face.</P>
<P>Fixed to the place where he &s;tood un|heeded
among &s;ome other idle people who
were looking on, he remained gazing at
her for &s;everal minutes. His legs trembled
&s;o that it was with difficulty he &s;upported
him&s;elf, and his heart beat as if it would
break. He debated with him&s;elf whether
he &s;hould &s;peak to her, or retire unob|&s;erved;
but while he yet argued the point,
a &s;mile and a whi&s;per that pa&s;&s;ed between
her and Montague Thorold determined
him to fly from the torments he felt, and
which he found it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to en|dure
another moment: he &s;tepped ha&s;tily
away to find his &s;i&s;ter and entreat her to
go; but &s;o deeply was he affected, that,
weakened as he was by illne&s;s, he &s;taggered,
and might have fallen, had not the &s;hame
of betraying &s;o much weakne&s;s lent him re|&s;olution
to reach a chair, where he &s;at a
moment to recover breath and recollection.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="262">
Mortified tenderne&s;s and di&s;appointed
love gave him for an in&s;tant a &s;en&s;ation re|&s;embling
hatred. He fancied he could
quit Cele&s;tina never again to feel any inte|re&s;t
in her fate; but, leaving her to the
man &s;he preferred, &s;trengthen him&s;elf
again&s;t his fatal and till now invincible
attachment, by contemplating the fatal
barrier which he had &s;o long been try|ing
to de&s;troy, and to believe that artifice
rather than nature had placed between them.
Of this cau&s;e of their &s;eparation, no part
had in fact been removed; and he re|proached
him&s;elf for the ab&s;urdity, folly,
and even vice of his pre&s;ent conduct. Hav|ing
argued him&s;elf into what he thought a
re&s;olution to feel no longer for Cele&s;tina,
he hurried to Lady Molyneux, and told
her, that if her game was not nearly at an
end, he mu&s;t leave her and go home in a
chair, as he found him&s;elf unable to bear
the heat of the room.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter an&s;wered, that &s;he was only
&s;ettling her winnings, and would attend
<PB N="253" REF="263">
him in a moment if he would wait for her.
He agreed to do &s;o, and going to the door
that led out of that into the next room, he
leaned again&s;t the &s;ide of it, turning his
eyes as much as po&s;&s;ible from the apartment
where Cele&s;tina was.</P>
<P>Lo&s;t in the painful &s;en&s;ations inflicted by
di&s;tracting jealou&s;y and bitter regret, which
he yet &s;truggled to &s;ti&s;le, he di&s;tingui&s;hed
not the objects: all, to him, unintere&s;ting
that moved before him. A croud of young
people, however, who had ju&s;t ri&s;en from
their table, were pre&s;&s;ing into another
room where refre&s;hments were di&s;tributed.
He moved a little to make way for them,
when he &s;aw, clo&s;e to him, and even borne
again&s;t him by her companions, Cele&s;tina
her&s;elf. Her face was at fir&s;t turned from
him; for &s;he was &s;peaking to Montague
Thorold, who was on the other &s;ide; but
finding her&s;elf crouding again&s;t &s;omebody,
&s;he turned to apologi&s;e for the rudene&s;s &s;he
was guilty of, when the well known figure,
the well known face of Willoughby, ema|ciated
<PB N="254" REF="264">
and pale as they were, in&s;tantly
&s;truck her. An involuntary and faint
&s;hriek te&s;tified the impre&s;&s;ion they made;
and Willoughby, who caught the weak
&s;ound of her di&s;tre&s;sful voice, was at fir&s;t,
by an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e, hurried to her
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but &s;eeing the arm of Montague
Thorold &s;upporting her, and his counte|nance
expre&s;&s;ing all the intere&s;t he took in
her emotion, heimputed that emotion to her
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her attachment to her new
favourite; and darting at her a look of im|patient
reproach, he forced him&s;elf through
the croud, and without looking back, &s;at
down breathle&s;s and trembling by Lady
Molyneux, who was that moment coming
forward to meet him.</P>
<P>The agitation of poor Cele&s;tina could not
be concealed, nor could &s;he for a moment
or two e&s;cape from the enquiring eyes of
tho&s;e who remarked it. As &s;oon, however,
as &s;he could di&s;engage her&s;elf from the
throng, &s;he &s;at down, hardly daring to en|quire
whether what &s;he had &s;een was real or
<PB N="255" REF="265">
vi&s;ionary. She had returned from Oxford|&s;hire
with Lady Horatia only the evening
before, and knew nothing of Willoughby's
being in England; while, in addition to
the amazement the &s;ight of him occa&s;ioned,
his apparent ill health impre&s;&s;ed her with
concern, and the di&s;plea&s;ure with which he
&s;urveyed her, with terror.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, who had &s;een Wil|loughby,
and who&s;e eyes were never a
moment away from Cele&s;tina, knew at once
the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s. He followed her,
little le&s;s affected than &s;he was her&s;elf, to a &s;o|pha
where &s;he had thrown her&s;elf, and a&s;ked
her, in a faint and tremulous voice, if he
&s;hould fetch her any thing? &s;he an&s;wered
"if you plea&s;e," &s;o low that he &s;carce di&s;|tingui&s;hed
what &s;he &s;aid; but &s;tepping a
few paces from her, he took a gla&s;s of le|monade
from a &s;ervant and brought it to
her. She took it, and carried it to her
lips, almo&s;t uncon&s;cious of what &s;he did,
while Montague Thorold leaned over the
arm of the &s;opha on which &s;he &s;at, and
<PB N="256" REF="266">
watched the emotions of <HI>her</HI> countenance,
with all the &s;olicitude he felt &s;trongly
painted on his own.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame moment Willoughby ap|peared,
leading Lady Molyneux through
the room. The fir&s;t objects that he &s;aw as
he approached the door, were Cele&s;tina and
Montague Thorold: but having once &s;een
them, he turned ha&s;tily from them; and
&s;eeming to give all his attention to his &s;i&s;ter,
he di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina's eyes followed him with a look
of inexpre&s;&s;ible amazement and concern.
She &s;eemed to be in a fearful dream; and
when &s;he no longer &s;aw him, her eyes were
fixed on the door through which he had
gone out. She heeded no longer what
Montague Thorold &s;aid to her; but &s;at,
with a palpitating heart and oppre&s;&s;ed
breath, till Lady Horatia, after twice
&s;peaking to her, rou&s;ed her from her half
formed and confu&s;ed reflections by remind|ing
her it was time to go.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="267">
She followed, in &s;ilence, where Lady
Horatia led, and at the coach door wi&s;hed
Montague Thorold good night; for the
only di&s;tinct &s;en&s;ation &s;he felt, was a wi&s;h
for his ab&s;ence: but Lady Horatia, who
was immediately going home, de&s;ired him
to return and &s;up with her; which, without
knowing what he did, he con&s;ented to,
though too con&s;cious while he did it that
Cele&s;tina had rather be without him, for as
he handed her into the coach, he felt her
tremble &s;o that &s;he could hardly &s;upport
her&s;elf, and he heard the deep &s;igh bur&s;t
from her heart as if it would break.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia had not &s;een Willoughby,
and had no idea of Cele&s;tina's &s;ufferings.
She talked therefore in her u&s;ual way of the
people they had &s;een, and of &s;ome books
that had been recommended to her; till
ob&s;erving that Cele&s;tina, who u&s;ually bore
her part in the conver&s;ation, did not an&s;wer,
&s;he enquired if &s;he was not well?</P>
<P>"Pretty well, I thank your Lady&s;hip,"
replied Cele&s;tina; "but I am uncommonly
<PB N="258" REF="268">
fatigued to-night, and have the head ach."
This an&s;wer &s;atisfied Lady Horatia, who
continued to addre&s;s her&s;elf to Montague
Thorold, till they arrived in Park-&s;treet;
where Cele&s;tina would immediately have
gone to her own room, &s;o unfit was &s;he for
conver&s;ation and &s;o unable to &s;u&s;tain it;
but Lady Horatia ordering her woman to
bring a remedy for the head ach, of which
Cele&s;tina had complained, and that had be|fore
been of &s;ervice to her, &s;he, rather than
alarm her kind benefactre&s;s, &s;at down near
the &s;upper table to wait for it.</P>
<P>But &s;o great an effect had the violent
though &s;hort perturbation of her &s;pirits had
on her countenance, that Lady Horatia
immediately perceived it. "The head
ach!" cried &s;he in &s;urpri&s;e, and taking Ce|le&s;tina's
hand: "my dear, you have &s;urely
&s;omething wor&s;e the matter with you than a
common head ach"</P>
<P>"Pray, deare&s;t Madam," replied Cele&s;|tina,
"pardon me if I am utterly unable
to &s;ay what is the matter. To-morrow I
<PB N="259" REF="269">
&s;hall be better, and I know you will for|give
me till then."</P>
<P>The manner in which &s;he uttered the&s;e
few words, as, trembling and faint, &s;he ad|vanced
towards the door, alarmed and &s;ur|pri&s;ed
Lady Horatia. She &s;aw, however,
by the countenance of Montague Thorold,
that he could explain the cau&s;e of Cele&s;tina's
unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;he therefore &s;uffered her to de|part,
and immediately made the enquiry of
him.</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly informed her of what he had
&s;een; and with no favourable de&s;cription of
the looks and manner of Willoughby,
which had indeed appeared to him to be
extremely cruel and in&s;ulting towards Ce|le&s;tina.
Lady Horatia, with whom Wil|loughby
was no favourite, and who ex|tremely
di&s;liked his &s;i&s;ter Lady Molyneux,
&s;aw his conduct in the &s;ame point of view
as Thorold repre&s;ented it; and, after &s;ome
conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject, &s;aid, that
though &s;he was much concerned for the
&s;hock Cele&s;tina had received, yet that upon
<PB N="260" REF="270">
the whole it might perhaps be better for
her that this circum&s;tance had happened.
"For now," &s;aid &s;he, "I think &s;he will,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, as &s;he does, &s;o much proper
pride, be convinced, that even if the &s;tory
coming from Lady Ca&s;tlenorth has no
foundation, as I my&s;elf &s;uppo&s;e it has, that
&s;till &s;he ought not to indulge her early pre|judice
in favour of a man, who, whatever
<HI>he</HI> may have pretended or <HI>&s;he</HI> may have be|lieved,
never intended to act honourably
by her, and now not only de&s;erts but in|&s;ults
her."</P>
<P>Thorold heartily a&s;&s;ented to this opinion,
and &s;at down to &s;upper with a heart &s;ome|what
relieved from the extreme unea&s;ine&s;s
which the emotion of Cele&s;tina on the ap|pearance
of Willoughby had given him.
Still, however, he could not eat, he could
not conver&s;e; but as &s;oon as he could di&s;|engage
him&s;elf, he took leave of Lady
Horatia, and full of anxiety, and trembling
lea&s;t all the hopes he had of late &s;o fondly
cheri&s;hed &s;hould be bla&s;ted, he returned to
his lodgings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA, in retiring to her own
room, had hoped to recall her &s;cattered and
oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, and clearly recollect all
that had befallen her; but the angry, the
di&s;dainful look which that countenance
wore where &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee
only the &s;miles of approbation or the ten|derly
anxious looks of love, was the image
&s;till mo&s;t prevalent in her mind, joined to
the painful idea of the ruined con&s;titution
of him who&s;e life was ever dearer to her
than her own.</P>
<P>The cruelty of his being in London, of
his going into public without ever having
&s;een or wrote to her, &s;unk deeply into her
heart. "Ah! Willoughby," exclaimed
&s;he, "is it thus we meet again after &s;uch
<PB N="262" REF="272">
a parting? Is this the end of all your a&s;|&s;urances,
that you would ever be my friend?
that you would learn to con&s;ider me as your
&s;i&s;ter if we were indeed related? alas! is it
thus then you throw me off entirely, and
&s;eem &s;orry to remember that you ever &s;aw
me?" A flood of tears followed this cruel
reflection; but after weeping &s;ome time,
her pride came to her relief: &s;he remem|bered
the haughty neglect with which Lady
Molyneux had treated her, and doubted
not but that her influence with Willoughby
had prevailed on him to expel her for ever
from that place in his regard which the
very rea&s;ons on which he re&s;igned her as
his wife, ought to give her as a defencele&s;s
and unhappy orphan, dependent on his
family. She recollected now but too well
the re&s;erve and di&s;dain, the look of min|gled
anger and &s;corn, which Willoughby's
features &s;poke as &s;he &s;aw him the &s;econd
time leading out his &s;i&s;ter; and her mind
dwelt on the expre&s;&s;ion of his eyes as they
fir&s;t met her's; when, though he mu&s;t have
<PB N="263" REF="273">
&s;een how much &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed and af|fected
by the &s;ight of him, he flew from
her without one con&s;oling word, though it
was evident &s;he could hardly &s;upport her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>"All is over then," cried &s;he: "that
tender friend&s;hip which would have been
the con&s;olation of my life, is at an end.
Every tie that from our infancy united us
is broken, and I have now no reliance but
on the kindne&s;s of tho&s;e who are compara|tively
&s;trangers. Ah! is it generous thus
to di&s;card me, without even trying to
&s;often the blow: but go, cruel, capricious
man, go, and enjoy, with your opulent
heire&s;s, all that affluence can give: go, and
become callous and in&s;en&s;ible to all tho&s;e
noble &s;entiments that once animated your
bo&s;om, which once rendered you &s;o de|&s;ervedly
dear to me. They are gone. Wil|loughby,
&s;elfi&s;h, cruel, unfeeling, and in|&s;olent,
is not the Willoughby to whom my
heartwas devoted. Why therefore &s;hould I
be thus wretched about him? why let his
<PB N="264" REF="274">
proud malignant &s;i&s;ter triumph in knowing
that I am mortified and unhappy. Let me
try to drive his too painful remembrance
from me; or at lea&s;t to remember him only
as the &s;on of my beloved benefactre&s;s."</P>
<P>At the mention of that revered name,
however, all her newly acquired re&s;olution
for&s;ook her. The memory of her tender,
her fir&s;t friend, was &s;o intimately connected
with that of Willoughby him&s;elf, that her
tears flowed for both; and again&s;t the un|kindne&s;s
of the latter neither her pride nor
her rea&s;on could &s;u&s;tain her.</P>
<P>A &s;leeple&s;s night &s;ucceeded to this con|flicting
evening; and it was not till towards
morning that Cele&s;tina determined to write
to Willoughby, entreating him &s;till to al|low
her that place in his friend&s;hip, which
no fault of her's had, &s;he thought, forfeited,
and a&s;&s;uring him that whatever might be
her de&s;tiny her regard for him was un|changeable,
though &s;he would never in|trude
upon him with it. Her tenderne&s;s
conquered her re&s;entment, and the idea of
<PB N="265" REF="275">
what &s;he owed to the &s;on of her early friend,
whatever might be his conduct towards her,
came in aid of that long rooted tenderne&s;s,
and produced the re&s;olution which &s;he
meant to execute in the morning. Having
thus determined, her mind gradually be|came
more tranquil, and her &s;pirits being
quite exhau&s;ted, &s;he &s;unk into &s;lumber.</P>
<P>But the fainter though &s;till painful ideas
of the evening before pur&s;ued her; and af|ter
tormenting her with numberle&s;s wild
terrors, &s;he fancied that &s;he &s;aw Willoughby
with the &s;ame menacing look he wore the
preceding night, with a dagger in his hand,
approaching and threatening her to plunge
it into a heart, which was, he &s;aid, perfi|dious
and ungrateful, and had been the
means of driving him to guilt and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>From an image of &s;uch horror &s;he wildly
&s;tarted; and awaking, found Lady Hora|tia
Howard &s;itting by her bed &s;ide, holding
one of her hands, and gazing on her with
great concern.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="276">
With the mo&s;t &s;oothing voice &s;he &s;poke
to Cele&s;tina, and endeavoured to quiet the
exce&s;&s;ive agitation of her &s;pirits. Her rea|&s;onable
and gentle arguments had their de|&s;ired
effect; and Cele&s;tina, a&s;hamed of ap|pearing
in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;olicitude of &s;uch
a friend, &s;ummoned all her re&s;olution to
her aid, and was able in about an hour to
attend the breakfa&s;t table with &s;omething
like compo&s;ure. Her cheeks, however,
had &s;till that crim&s;on glow which the per|turbed
&s;tate of her mind had given them:
her eyes were heavy with tears, which in
de&s;pite of all her efforts continued to fill
them when the image of Willoughby, pale
and thin, with anger fla&s;hing from his eyes,
and contempt trembling on his lips, again
aro&s;e in her imagination. Lady Horatia
looked at her with more than her u&s;ual ten|der
complacency; for it was when her fine
open countenance expre&s;&s;ed pen&s;ive &s;orrow,
that &s;he was, from her then particularly re|&s;embling
the regretted brother of Lady
Horatia, to her more than u&s;ually intere&s;ting.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="277">
Before the breakfa&s;t table was removed,
Montague Thorold was introduced. He
was extremely dejected; and hardly able to
return the compliments of Lady Horatia,
who was always glad to &s;ee him, and who
had undoubtedly given him all her intere&s;t
with Cele&s;tina, and more encouragement to
pur&s;ue his &s;uit than was perhaps &s;trictly pru|dent;
&s;ince Cele&s;tina, though &s;he could not
avoid him, though &s;he never could prevail
upon her&s;elf to behave to him with unkind|ne&s;s,
and though his talents and conver&s;a|tion,
and perhaps that &s;ort of re&s;pectful
idolatry by which few women can help be|ing
gratified however they may wi&s;h to re|pre&s;s
it, were, in &s;ome degree, plea&s;ing to
her, had yet repeatedly declared to Lady
Horatia and to Montague Thorold him&s;elf,
that &s;he felt not, and was per&s;uaded &s;he never
&s;hould feel for him, that tender preference,
without which &s;he never would marry.
This declaration they both imputed to that
affection for Willoughby, which the uncer|tainty
<PB N="268" REF="278">
of her own &s;ituation continued to
nouri&s;h. Per&s;uaded as they both were, that
Willoughby had promi&s;ed to become the
hu&s;band of Mi&s;s Fitz Hayman, which every
body but Cele&s;tina had long believed,
Lady Horatia doubted not but that the
merit and attachment of Montague Tho|rold,
the &s;imilarity of their ta&s;te, Cele&s;tina's
regard for his father, and the ea&s;y compe|tence
which with him &s;he could po&s;&s;e&s;s and
which &s;he often declared was the condition
of life &s;he would prefer, would altogether
induce her to reward his ardent affection
with her hand, as &s;oon as it became certain
that Willoughby, either from intere&s;ted mo|tives
or from conviction of their too near
relation&s;hip, ab&s;olutely and for ever relin|qui&s;hed
all preten&s;ions to it. She was,
therefore, glad that the accidental meeting
which had &s;o much affected Cele&s;tina was
likely to ha&s;ten this period; and far from
&s;eeing it in the unfavourable light Thorold
him&s;elf did, &s;he told him, as &s;oon as Ce|le&s;tina
<PB N="269" REF="279">
left the room, that for him no cir|cum&s;tance
could be more favourable.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia had long &s;ince transferred
entirely to Montague Thorold tho&s;e good
wi&s;hes which &s;he had at fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed to|wards
Vava&s;our. His great fortune, his
hand&s;ome figure, and his apparent affection
for Cele&s;tina, had for &s;ome time intere&s;ted
her for him; and &s;he imputed his extrava|gant
vivacity, and even his violent irregu|larities,
to his youth and unchecked habits
of gratification. Before her, Vava&s;our had
at fir&s;t &s;o far re&s;trained the intemperate &s;al|lies
of his ungovernable temper, that &s;he
was for &s;ome time di&s;po&s;ed to think well of
his heart and his under&s;tanding: but &s;oon
finding that this &s;emblance of moderation
availed him not, and that he gained no|thing
on the inflexible heart of Cele&s;tina, he
became tired of it, and relap&s;ed into &s;uch a
wild way of talking, and of boa&s;ting of ac|tions
&s;till wilder, that Lady Horatia was no
longer able to excu&s;e him; and though &s;he
&s;till received him at her hou&s;e with civility,
<PB N="270" REF="280">
&s;he entirely approved of the re&s;olution Ce|le&s;tina
had made never to li&s;ten to him as a
lover.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t at that period that Montague
Thorold, who on Cele&s;tina's fir&s;t arrival in
town had not availed him&s;elf of the per|mi&s;&s;ion
he had obtained to &s;ee her, came
to &s;olicit of Lady Horatia that indulgence,
and accounted for his ab&s;ence by relating a
long illne&s;s his father had ju&s;t e&s;caped; in
which, as Mrs. Thorold was ab&s;ent with
one of her daughters, he had him&s;elf been
his only and con&s;tant attendant. "You
know," &s;aid he to Cele&s;tina, "how much I
love my father, and how well he de&s;erves
that I &s;hould love him; and you will ea&s;ily
imagine what mu&s;t have been my anxiety,
when, for &s;o many nights and days, I &s;aw
him experience the mo&s;t excruciating tor|tures,
and knew his life to be in the mo&s;t
imminent danger. Even the reigning, the
triumphant pa&s;&s;ion of my heart&mdash;my love,
my adoration of Cele&s;tina, was &s;u&s;pended,
<PB N="271" REF="281">
in the pain and &s;olicitude I &s;uffered for my
father."</P>
<P>His looks, which were greatly changed
&s;ince Cele&s;tina &s;aw him before, witne&s;&s;ed
how &s;evere this pain and &s;olicitude had
been; and Cele&s;tina not only forgave, but
e&s;teemed him the more for that neglect,
which had at fir&s;t given her a &s;light degree
of mortification. From that time he had
con&s;tantly vi&s;ited at the hou&s;e of Lady Ho|ratia,
and from his power of amu&s;ing her
by reading and conver&s;ation, he was be|come
&s;o great a favourite, that he had no
rival in her good opinion but Cele&s;tina her|&s;elf.
It was at her reque&s;t he had met
them at Oxford, and gone with them to
Bath and Bri&s;tol. Cele&s;tina, who &s;aw but
too plainly that all this was but feeding a
pa&s;&s;ion already fatal to the repo&s;e of a
young man whom &s;he highly e&s;teemed, had
in vain remon&s;trated with Lady Horatia on
the &s;ubject; who an&s;wered, that <HI>her</HI> pre|&s;ence
was a &s;ufficient protection, and that as
to his love, he would not indulge it the le&s;s
<PB N="272" REF="282">
for being refu&s;ed the opportunity of &s;peak|ing
of it. To this doctrine Cele&s;tina could
not a&s;&s;ent; but, in her &s;ituation, to diffent
was of little effect; and all &s;he could do to
counteract the effects of this indi&s;creet in|dulgence
of Lady Horatia towards Monta|gue
Thorold, was, to declare to him very
&s;olemnly, whenever he introduced the &s;ub|ject
of his love, which was whenever they
were alone, that though her e&s;teem and re|gard
for him were very great, &s;he never
could think of him otherwi&s;e than as
her friend: and when he an&s;wered, that
content with that e&s;teem and regard he
&s;hould be the happie&s;t of mankind to be
permitted by time and tenderne&s;s to win her
love, &s;he very frankly a&s;&s;ured him, that the
&s;entiments which were once her's for Wil|loughby,
though towards him they might
be at an end, could never, &s;he was well a&s;|&s;ured,
be transferred to another.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, however, young,
&s;anguine, and violently in love, was not
ea&s;ily di&s;couraged; while the favour of
<PB N="273" REF="283">
Lady Horatia, the wi&s;hes of his father, and
the complacency and kindne&s;s with which,
notwith&s;tanding her repeated declarations,
Cele&s;tina treated him, all contributed to
cheri&s;h a pa&s;&s;ion which in&s;en&s;ibly ab&s;orbed
his whole &s;oul. Every action, every &s;enti|ment,
every look of Cele&s;tina, at once en|crea&s;ed
and ju&s;tified this exce&s;&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion;
and he lived now only to think of her when
he was ab&s;ent, or gaze on her with adora|tion
when &s;he was pre&s;ent. Whenever he
knew &s;he was to be at any public place, (in|formation
which he was very a&s;&s;iduous and
very &s;ucce&s;sful in obtaining,) thither he
went al&s;o; and though, unle&s;s he was in|vited,
he never introduced him&s;elf into the
parties &s;he was with, he contrived &s;o to
place him&s;elf as to be able to &s;ee her, and
was content.</P>
<P>The extreme dejection with which he had
on the la&s;t morning entered the hou&s;e of
Lady Horatia, all fled before her a&s;&s;urances
that the meeting between Willoughby and
Cele&s;tina, however &s;he might for a little
<PB N="274" REF="284">
time be affected by it, would prove of ad|vantage
to him. Elated more than ever by
hope, he left Lady Horatia, having ob|tained
leave to meet them at the opera,
whither they were going that evening.</P>
<P>But with poor Cele&s;tina it was very dif|ferent:
hope had now wholly for&s;aken her,
yet &s;till &s;he clung even to de&s;pair, when it
gave her an excu&s;e for dwelling on the be|loved
and regretted name of Willoughby.</P>
<P>She took out of her dre&s;&s;ing box a locket,
in which his hair was interwoven with that
of his mother and of his &s;i&s;ter, and which
&s;he had been u&s;ed when a child to wear
round her neck. She looked at it a mo|ment,
and remembered a thou&s;and cir|cum&s;tances
that brought the tears again
into her eyes. She ki&s;&s;ed it; &s;he put it to
her heart; and that &s;oft heart melting at the
tender images this &s;light memorial pre|&s;ented
to it, the re&s;entment which her pride
had made her feel the evening before was
forgotten; while, unable to bear the thoughts
of having &s;een the la&s;t of Willoughby, of
<PB N="275" REF="285">
his having taken an accidental but eternal
leave of her with anger and &s;corn, &s;he de|termined
in&s;tantly to execute her purpo&s;e
formed the evening before, and with a trem|bling
and uncertain hand wrote as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Do not think, dear Willoughby, that
the unfortunate Cele&s;tina means to in|trade
upon you with her complaints, or
to trouble you, after the pre&s;ent moment,
with even her name. But when tho&s;e
recollections which &s;he cannot all at
once &s;ubdue pre&s;s upon her heart, &s;he
finds it impo&s;&s;ible, quite impo&s;&s;ible, to
&s;ubmit to take of you an eternal farewel,
without entreating, that though we ne|ver
meet again, we may part in peace
with each other.</P>
<P>I might indeed urge to you, Wil|loughby,
that if the account you gave
me of our &s;uppo&s;ed relation&s;hip be re|alized,
it ought not to excite your anger,
but to give me a claim to your protec|tion.
If my heart did not, I know not
<PB N="276" REF="286">
why, revolt from the idea of being &s;o
nearly your relation, I might on that
&s;core claim your protection and your
pity; I might be permitted &s;urely to
love you as my brother, &s;ince, alas! whe|ther
you permit it or no, I mu&s;t &s;till
love you&mdash;but with an affection &s;o di&s;in|tere&s;ted
and pure, that, be my &s;ituation
in regard to you what it may, I feel no|thing
for which I ought to blu&s;h.</P>
<P>You look very ill, Willoughby. You
look unhappy: and on me you looked
unkindly. I do not a&s;k to &s;ee you, &s;ince
my accidentally meeting you was evi|dently
painful to you; but I a&s;k to have
a few lines from you to tell me that you
are not ill, that you are not unhappy,
and that your once loved Cele&s;tina is
not become hateful to you. Believe me,
I &s;hall rejoice in your happine&s;s where|ever
found. Do not then refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t
me in obtaining&mdash;not happine&s;s, for that
is no where to be found for me&mdash;but in
obtaining that degree of content and re|&s;ignation
<PB N="277" REF="287">
which may enable me to go
through life without regretting the hour
that I ever received it. This, Willough|by,
is in your power, and you mu&s;t be

<P>Though by no means &s;atisfied with her
letter when &s;he had fini&s;hed it, &s;he de&s;paired
of plea&s;ing her&s;elf better. She therefore
&s;ealed and &s;ent it away by one of the foot|men
to the hou&s;e of Lady Molyneux, as
&s;he knew no other addre&s;s to Willoughby.
The &s;ervant returned in about half an hour,
and told her that Mr. Willoughby was not
there, but that he had &s;ent in the letter and
received a me&s;&s;age that it &s;hould be taken
care of and delivered to him.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="288">
She had flattered her&s;elf that if not a

put an end to that almo&s;t in&s;upportable
&s;tate of anxiety which &s;he had been in ever
&s;ince &s;he &s;aw him. If he wrote to her with

as much coldne&s;s and di&s;dain as he did dur|ing
their &s;hort interview, &s;he hoped that
re&s;entment would &s;upport her: and that
though her pride might be wounded, her
affection would torment her le&s;s.</P>
<P>She was now, however, to wait&mdash;per|haps
a whole day in anxiety; and, what was
more dreadful, be compelled to &s;u&s;tain this
anxiety under the appearance of calmne&s;s
if not of cheerfulne&s;s; for Lady Horatia,
who had made an engagement with &s;ome of
her friends to go to the opera, whither &s;he
&s;eldom went her&s;elf, on purpo&s;e to gratify
Cele&s;tina by hearing a new and celebrated
performer, did not &s;eem at all di&s;po&s;ed to
reli&s;h the propo&s;al &s;he had ventured to hint
at breakfa&s;t, of being left out of the party
<PB N="279" REF="289">
of the evening: and though &s;he was gene|rally
very de&s;irous that Cele&s;tina &s;hould in
all &s;uch matters follow her own inclinations,
yet there were times when &s;he &s;eemed to
expect &s;ome &s;acrifices to be made to her.</P>
<P>Her grateful heart was extremely &s;en&s;ible
of all the kindne&s;s of Lady Horatia; who,
from having taken her into her protection
quite a &s;tranger, was now &s;o attached to
her that her happine&s;s &s;eemed her fir&s;t ob|ject.
Having no very &s;trong affection for
her only &s;urviving brother, who was a man
immer&s;ed in politics and without pretence
to natural affection; and having been torn
early in life from a man &s;he loved, and mar|ried
by her father to one towards whom &s;he
was indifferent; having &s;ince followed her
three children, who alone had reconciled
her to her lot, to their early graves; her
heart had become in&s;en&s;ible to what are
commonly called friend&s;hips, and &s;he had
for &s;ome years rather &s;ought to amu&s;e than
to connect her&s;elf. But the graces of Ce|le&s;tina's
mind, the &s;weetne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;i|tion,
<PB N="280" REF="290">
and the goodne&s;s of her heart, had &s;o
won upon her, that the apathy of wearied
&s;en&s;ibility, which &s;he had &s;o long been in,
gradually gave place to an affection almo&s;t
as tender as &s;he could have felt had &s;he been
her mother; and this affection, created by
merit, was &s;trengthened by the re&s;emblance
which continually &s;truck her between Cele&s;|tina
and her younger brother, who lo&s;t his
life in America, the lo&s;s, which, among all
her misfortunes, &s;he mo&s;t &s;everely lamented.</P>
<P>Her encrea&s;ing tenderne&s;s for Cele&s;tina,
made her often reflect with unea&s;ine&s;s on
her &s;ituation, and very earne&s;tly wi&s;h to &s;ee
her married. She was very &s;en&s;ible that her
own life was not a good one; for early ca|lamity
had &s;haken her con&s;titution and
brought on in the early autumn of her days
the infirmities of old age; and &s;he knew,
that after having taken her as her daughter,
and accu&s;tomed her to &s;hare all the indul|gencies
which her own rank and income
procured, it would be a very painful re|ver&s;e
of fortune were &s;he to leave her in the
<PB N="281" REF="291">
narrow circum&s;tances in which &s;he found
her. To &s;ave much out of her jointure had
never been her wi&s;h, and was hardly now
in her power. Her own fortune, in default
of children, returned to her brother; and
all &s;he had to di&s;po&s;e of was about two
thou&s;and pounds. This &s;he gave, by a will
made in the fourth month of their being
together, to Cele&s;tina; and with this, and
what &s;he before had, &s;he thought that Ce|le&s;tina
might, if married to Montague Tho|rold,
enjoy through life that ea&s;y compe|tence
which was the utmo&s;t of her ambi|tion.
The embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances of
Willoughby, which the good natured world
had always exaggerated, and which Lady
Horatia had con&s;idered as irretrievable; his
very expen&s;ive place at Alve&s;tone, which
&s;he knew it required a large fortune to keep
up; the doubtful birth of Cele&s;tina, whom
&s;he always fancied too nearly related to
him; and &s;ome prejudice again&s;t him,
merely becau&s;e he was the brother of Lady
Molyneux, whom &s;he &s;o very much di&s;|liked;
<PB N="282" REF="292">
all combined to rai&s;e in the mind of
Lady Horatia a de&s;ire to impede every
&s;tep towards the re-union of Cele&s;tina and
Willoughby, and to promote her alliance
with Montague Thorold, near who&s;e re&s;i|dence,
wherever it was, &s;he propo&s;ed to
take a hou&s;e in &s;ummer, and to have them
frequently with her in winter at her hou&s;e
in town.</P>
<P>Though &s;he had not di&s;clo&s;ed all her in|tentions,
Cele&s;tina yet knew enough to be
deeply &s;en&s;ible of the uncommon gene|ro&s;ity
of her friend, and the whole &s;tudy of
her life was to &s;hew that &s;he was &s;o. She
made it a rule never to oppo&s;e the wi&s;hes of
Lady Horatia whenever they were clearly
expre&s;&s;ed; and therefore it was that &s;he had
often, contrary to her own judgment and
to her own inclinations, &s;uffered the a&s;&s;i|duities
of Montague Thorold; and &s;eemed
to the world to give him that encourage|ment,
the ill effects of which &s;he endea|voured
to counteract, by ingenuou&s;ly de|claring
to him the impo&s;&s;ibility of her ever
<PB N="283" REF="293">
making the return he expected to his affec|tion.</P>
<P>Too certain that Lady Horatia would be
di&s;appointed if not di&s;plea&s;ed if &s;he declined
on this evening to go out, and not having
courage to tell her the &s;tep &s;he had taken
in regard to writing to Willoughby, &s;he
was compelled to &s;truggle with her unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
and to attempt concealing if &s;he could
not conquer it: but every rap at the door
which &s;eemed to be that of a &s;ervant, made
her tremble; and while &s;itting at work be|fore
dinner, &s;he could not help going to
the window &s;everal times, nor li&s;tening to
every &s;ound that &s;he heard in the hall.
Time wore away, and her impatience en|crea&s;ed,
and at length grew &s;o evident that
Lady Horatia remarked it. "What is
the matter, my dear?" enquired &s;he: "do
you expect any one?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, con&s;cious that &s;he was betray|ing
her&s;elf, and fearing lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould be
blamed for what &s;he had done, of which &s;he
began already to repent as too humiliating,
<PB N="284" REF="294">
blu&s;hed at this que&s;tion &s;o deeply, that had
not Lady Horatia been intent at that mo|ment
on her work, her &s;u&s;picions mu&s;t have
been heightened. Cele&s;tina, however, not
immediately an&s;wering, &s;he repeated her
que&s;tion&mdash;"do you expect any body?"
Twenty rea&s;ons might have been given for
her &s;eeming anxiety, and twenty people
might have been named as likely to call;
but not one of all the&s;e occurred to Cele&s;|tina,
who was little practi&s;ed in di&s;&s;imula|tion:
&s;he therefore an&s;wered faintly, "no;"
and in hopes of turning Lady Horatia's at|tention
from her, and of hiding what &s;he
felt, &s;he propo&s;ed fini&s;hing the peru&s;al of a
poem which Montague Thorold had began
to read the preceding morning.</P>
<P>"Do &s;o," &s;aid Lady Horatia.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina took up the book and began;
but had no idea of what &s;he was about, and
of cour&s;e read &s;o extremely ill, and &s;o un|like
her u&s;ual manner, that Lady Horatia,
looking at her very earne&s;tly, &s;aid "Surely,
Cele&s;tina&mdash;&s;urely &s;omething is the matter?"</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="295">
"No, indeed, Madam," replied &s;he,
"nothing except perhaps &s;ome &s;light re|mains
of nervous agitation, from the cir|cum&s;tances
of la&s;t night."</P>
<P>"Try, my dear, to conquer that," re|plied
Lady Horatia, "and think of re|gaining
the compo&s;ure you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed be|fore;
which &s;uch a circum&s;tance, fairly con|&s;idered,
ought not to de&s;troy."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina &s;ighed; and to avoid the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of giving an an&s;wer, went on with
the book before her. She had hardly, how|ever,
read ten lines, when a &s;ervant brought
in a letter and gave it her. She turned paler
than death as &s;he took it, and the book fell
from her hands.</P>
<P>Lady Horaria, who&s;e attention was now
fixed upon her, eagerly a&s;ked from whom
was the letter. Cele&s;tina had by this time
read it; for it was only a note from a young
friend, for who&s;e painting &s;he had promi&s;ed
to give &s;ome pattern. She put it down:
"It is only from Mi&s;s Clayton, Madam,"
&s;aid &s;he, "about the patterns I am drawing
for her."</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="296">
"Dear child," cried Lady Horatia, "and
is all this trembling and anxiety, this faul|tering
and &s;olicitude, about Mi&s;s Clayton's
patterns? Cele&s;tina, I am afraid you are
not ingenuous with me. Surely I de&s;erve
that you &s;hould be &s;o?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina felt that this accu&s;ation, of want
of confidence, and the claim made to it,
were equally ju&s;t. The mea&s;ure &s;he had
adopted, at the ri&s;que of di&s;plea&s;ing her
be&s;t friend, had produced nothing but
&s;ome hours of angui&s;h, and would end pro|bably
in the conviction that Willoughby
de&s;pi&s;ed and contemned her: for it was
now five o'clock; and it was very impro|bable
that he &s;hould not, in all the hours
that had intervened &s;ince &s;he wrote, have
been at his lodgings, or have had time to
acknowledge the receipt of her letter. This
mortifying reflection, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
that &s;he ought to have con&s;ulted Lady Ho|ratia,
quite overwhelmed her. She was
pale and &s;ilent a moment; and then reco|vering
her voice, with difficulty &s;aid&mdash;"I
<PB N="287" REF="297">
believe I have acted &s;o fooli&s;hly, &s;o im|properly,
that I hardly dare hope you will
forgive me."</P>
<P>Lady Horatia expre&s;&s;ing her unea&s;ine&s;s
and &s;urpri&s;e, Cele&s;tina, in a tremulous
voice, told her what &s;he had done. Pity
rather than anger was created by the reci|tal.
"Certainly, my dear child," &s;aid
Lady Horatia, "had you con&s;ulted me, I
&s;hould have advi&s;ed you again&s;t writing to
Mr. Willoughby. Situated as you both
are, no advances &s;hould have come from
you. If he is convinced that you are &s;o
related to him as to make every thought of
you, beyond &s;uch as that relation&s;hip autho|ri&s;es,
guilty and odious, he &s;hould &s;urely,
on his coming to England, have &s;ent to
you if he was unwilling to &s;ee you, and
have behaved with humanity and brotherly,
tenderne&s;s, though love were for ever out
of the que&s;tion: if he is not convinced of
it, how will you account for his conduct,
but by &s;uppo&s;ing, that, influenced by pe|cuniary
motives or by caprice, he is de|&s;irous
<PB N="288" REF="298">
of forgetting all his former affection
for you, and yet has not that generous
openne&s;s of character which would urge
him to quit you hand&s;omely."</P>
<P>To the truth of the&s;e remarks Cele&s;tina
had nothing to object; but their ju&s;tice
cruelly depre&s;&s;ed her, and her &s;ick heart
recoiled from the idea of being obliged to
appear in public. Again &s;he ventured ve|ry
gently to in&s;inuate a wi&s;h to be left at
home that evening. "If you are really
ill you &s;hall," &s;aid Lady Horatia; "but
otherwi&s;e I hope you will go."</P>
<P>"I am not really ill," replied Cele&s;tina,
"if your Lady&s;hip means only bodily &s;uf|fering:
but my &s;pirits, my mind&mdash;"</P>
<P>"For the maladies of tho&s;e," interrupted
Lady Horatia, "there is no remedy more
&s;ure than change of &s;cene and variety of
amu&s;ement; and believe me, dear Cele&s;|tina&mdash;believe
me, (and I have &s;uffered
much from the maladies of the mind,) they
only grow by indulgence: if we would
conquer, we mu&s;t contend with and not
<PB N="289" REF="299">
encourage them.&mdash;You will &s;uffer much le&s;s
to-night, if you are in a circle of friends,
who love and admire you, than in brooding
at home over the defection of one, who, if
he ever did, certainly does not now de&s;erve
you.&mdash;I beg, therefore, that you will
go."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, unaccu&s;tomed to di&s;pute any
wi&s;h of her friend, yielded, with as good a
grace as &s;he could, to her remon&s;trances;
and with a heavy and aching heart, went to
fini&s;h her dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The hour of going out arrived; and
Cele&s;tina found Montague Thorold, and a
Mr. Howard, a relation of Lady Horatia's,
ready to attend them.&mdash;As there was no
e&s;cape, &s;he endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume the &s;em|blance
of tranquillity, and to talk with
them on indifferent matters: but the idea
that Willoughby had left London without
&s;eeing her; or, being &s;till in it, di&s;dained to
an&s;wer her letter, and utterly refu&s;ed to no|tice
her; hung &s;o heavy on her heart, that
<PB N="290" REF="300">
&s;he could with difficulty &s;upport her&s;elf;
while the protracted &s;tate, in which &s;he had
been &s;ince the preceding evening, occa|&s;ioned
&s;uch a ferment in her blood, that
her cheeks were of a feveri&s;h crim&s;on; and
the languid lu&s;tre of her fine eyes never
appeared to greater advantage.&mdash;Deep &s;ighs,
which &s;he tried in vain to &s;uppre&s;s, &s;tole
from her heart; and Mr. Howard rallied
her upon them, with that &s;ort of common|place
wit, which is &s;o u&s;ual, and &s;o irk&s;ome,
where there is real unea&s;ine&s;s to contend
with: while Montague Thorold an&s;wered
every &s;igh of hers, by one yet deeper of
his own; and watched every turn of her
countenance with trembling &s;olicitude.&mdash;Lady
Horatia was to join another party at
the opera; and Cele&s;tina was in hopes,
that by obtaining a &s;eat in one of the la&s;t
rows in the box, &s;he &s;hould be excu&s;ed
from the ta&s;k of &s;eeming to give any at|tention,
either to the performance, or the
people around her.&mdash;This, therefore, &s;he
<PB N="291" REF="301">
contrived to do, and Montague Thorold
placed her&s;elf by her.</P>
<P>Her thoughts were engro&s;&s;ed wholly by
Willoughby&mdash;and by the cruelty of his re|fu&s;ing
to an&s;wer her letter. She &s;aw not the
objects about her; &s;he attended not to the
humble and plaintive voice of Thorold,
who now and then &s;poke to her; when
Lady Horatia Howard turning to her,
bade her remark, that into the oppo&s;ite box
had ju&s;t entered Lady Ca&s;tlenorth and her
daughter.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina in&s;tantly &s;aw them, and as in|&s;tantly
concluded, that Willoughby's con|duct
towards her was owing to his being on
the point of marriage with Mi&s;s Fitz|Hayman.&mdash;She
had hardly felt her heart
&s;ink under this cruel idea, before Wil|loughby
him&s;elf appeared; and Lady Ca&s;tle|worth
making room for him, he &s;at down
between her and her daughter.</P>
<P>A look from the penetrating eyes of Lady
Horatia Howard made Cele&s;tina turn away
her head; but &s;he then met the anxious
<PB N="292" REF="302">
and enquiring eyes of Montague Thorold;
and again &s;ought refuge in looking to|wards
the pit&mdash;hardly knowing where &s;he
was, and not daring again to tru&s;t her&s;elf
with the &s;ight of the group placed imme|diately
oppo&s;ite to her. Willoughby &s;aw
her not; and after a while, her eyes, in
de&s;pite of the pain &s;he felt, &s;ought him
again.&mdash;His countenance did not wear ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of bridal felicity&mdash;he was, &s;he
thought, paler and thinner than the night
before, and on his brow &s;ome corro&s;ive &s;or|row
&s;eemed to hang: but Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man,
gay and animated, talked to him in|ce&s;&s;antly;
and both &s;he and her mother en|deavoured
to engro&s;s his attention by a flow
of conver&s;ation.&mdash;He li&s;tened to them&mdash;but
Cele&s;tina fancied, with more politene&s;s than
plea&s;ure&mdash;He &s;miled; but &s;he thought his
&s;miles were the &s;miles of complai&s;ance, and
not of content. Still, however, his ap|pearance
in public with them was enough
to convince her that his marriage was not
far off. Her heart &s;unk at this &s;ad cer|tainty;
<PB N="293" REF="303">
for though &s;he had long &s;ince en|deavoured
to wean her mind from the hopes
of ever being his, &s;he had &s;till too keen re|collections
of that time when it was the
fir&s;t wi&s;h of both their hearts; and &s;he was
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an idea, &s;he hardly knew
why, that with Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, he
would be mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>That they had been parted by the arti|fice
of Lady Ca&s;tleworth, &s;he now more
than ever &s;u&s;pected. But how Willoughby
could be cheated into &s;uch a belief; and if
he was, why he &s;hould entirely throw off,
as a relation, her whom, as the cho&s;en
mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart, he had &s;o fondly
cheri&s;hed, &s;he could not comprehend; or
could &s;he in any way reconcile his conduct
with that manly and liberal &s;pirit, which
had &s;o eminently marked his character&mdash;As
&s;he gazed on his face, as on that of a
&s;tranger&mdash;the hu&s;band of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man&mdash;that
face which &s;he had been ac|cu&s;tomed
to contemplate with &s;o much
tenderne&s;s; and when &s;he con&s;idered that,
<PB N="294" REF="304">
lo&s;t to her for ever, &s;he now dared no
longer look up to <HI>him</HI> as a friend, whom
&s;he had once hoped to find, through life,
her fond and generous protector, her re|flections
became too bitter; and had &s;he
not feared that her going out would have
attracted his eyes towards her; and known
that Montague Thorold would have at|tended
her, which &s;he de&s;ired to avoid; &s;he
would have returned home&mdash;for her &s;uf|ferings
were almo&s;t in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>She hoped, however, to e&s;cape without
his &s;eeing her; and &s;hrunk back as much
as &s;he could, pretending that her head-ache
made the light particularly unea&s;y to her.
Montague Thorold, though knowing too
well the real &s;ource of her unea&s;ine&s;s was
yet as anxious as &s;he was that Willoughby
might not &s;ee her; and favoured her con|cealment
as much as he could.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the opera, however,
Willoughby, who &s;eemed very weary of his
&s;eat, left it to &s;peak to &s;omebody he &s;aw in
the pit&mdash;Cele&s;tina &s;aw him very near the
<PB N="295" REF="305">
box where &s;he &s;at; and became &s;o faint
that &s;he was afraid &s;he mu&s;t have &s;unk from
her &s;eat.&mdash;But her &s;ufferings &s;till en|crea&s;ed,
when, a moment afterwards, Mr.
Howard, who &s;at next to her, called to
him; and got up to &s;peak to him.&mdash;In an|&s;wering
his que&s;tion, Willoughby turned
towards him&mdash;his eyes immediately fell on
Cele&s;tina, and Montague Thorold clo&s;e
be&s;ide her.&mdash;An expre&s;&s;ion of mingled
anger and &s;corn ro&s;e in&s;tantly in his coun|tenance;
he abruptly broke off his conver|&s;ation
with Mr. Howard, and walked away.&mdash;In
a moment Cele&s;tina &s;aw him rejoin
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, and Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman.&mdash;She
&s;aw him affect to enter into conver|&s;ation
with them; but that it was all effort.
His eyes once or twice were turned to|wards
her, but immediately withdrawn as if
they had met a ba&s;ili&s;k; and after a very
few minutes, &s;he &s;aw, by his manner, that
he complained of the heat of the hou&s;e,
pleaded indi&s;po&s;ition, and left them.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, overwhelmed with &s;en&s;ations
<PB N="296" REF="306">
too much to be borne, began to think the
opera never would end; and that Lady
Horatia, who &s;aw her di&s;tre&s;s, had never
before had &s;o little compa&s;&s;ion. At length
it was fini&s;hed; and as Montague Thorold
handed her to the coach, &s;he be&s;ought him
not to &s;tay &s;upper, if Lady Horatia &s;hould
a&s;k him; "for I mu&s;t in that ca&s;e &s;tay,
you know, to entertain you, and really I
am &s;o unwell, that it is cruelty to expect it
of me." Gratified by the power of obeying
her, even when her wi&s;hes were contrary to
his own; and full of hope that this la&s;t
&s;truggle, between her lingering love for
Willoughby, and the certainty of his hav|ing
left her for another, would terminate
in his own favour, Thorold promi&s;ed to be
wholly governed by her, and took his leave
at the door.</P>
<P>"Well, Cele&s;tina," &s;aid Lady Horatia,
as &s;oon as they were alone, "you are now,
I think, convinced that Willoughby is, like
mo&s;t other men, capricious, and unfeeling.&mdash;What
was his conduct to-night, but the
<PB N="297" REF="307">
mo&s;t in&s;ulting that it was po&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ume
and after receiving a letter too from you,
which you con&s;e&s;s was couched in the ten|dere&s;t
and mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive terms, which,
as a gentleman, he ought to have an|&s;wered,
had you never had any claim what|ever
upon him.&mdash;I hope, and believe, how|ever,
that &s;uch conduct will have the hap|pie&s;t
effect&mdash;that of weaning you for ever
from that exce&s;&s;ive partiality, which from
early prejudice you always appeared to me
to think it a merit to cheri&s;h. If he quitted
you, as he pretended, on account of the
doubts rai&s;ed in his mind, by that &s;orcere&s;s,
Lady Ca&s;tlenorth, why does he not, tho&s;e
doubts being now certainties, own you as
his &s;i&s;ter, and become your protector as
relation? Why, if they are not a&s;certained,
does he poorly &s;hrink from the enquiry,
and evade, under &s;uch paltry pretences,
the engagements which you would &s;urely
relea&s;e: him from, if told that he no longer
wi&s;hed to accompli&s;h them."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina tried to &s;peak, but could not
<PB N="298" REF="308">
articulate; and Lady Horatia, who&s;e indig|nation
again&s;t Willoughby &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e
by indulgence, went on&mdash;"Let me
conjure you, then, my dear Cele&s;tina, to
exert that large &s;hare of rea&s;on, with which
you are endowed; and, expelling from your
mind all that has pa&s;&s;ed, try to look for|ward
to happier pro&s;pects&mdash;to pro&s;pects un|clouded,
by doubt, and undarkened by the
gloomy apprehen&s;ions of being de&s;pi&s;ed by
the family of your hu&s;band, and of be|ing
reproached as having embarra&s;&s;ed his
fortune. Time and rea&s;on, the a&s;&s;iduous
tenderne&s;s of a man who really adores you,
will conquer all remains of regret; and you
will, by degrees, learn to think of Wil|loughby,
and of all the events of your
early life, with the mo&s;t perfect indiffer|ence.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina thought that was impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;but
altogether unable to enter into the ar|gument,
&s;he could only &s;igh, and in a tre|mulous
voice intreat to be permitted to re|tire;
&s;aying that, in the morning, &s;he &s;hould
<PB N="299" REF="309">
have, &s;he hoped, more re&s;olution, and have
got the better of the agitation of her &s;pirits.
Sleep, however, refu&s;ed to vi&s;it her&mdash;the
image of Willoughby, cruel and capricious
as he was, ince&s;&s;antly haunted her. Hav|ing
been long u&s;ed to &s;tudy his counte|nance,
&s;he under&s;tood all its expre&s;&s;ions;
and when &s;he had courage to fix her eyes
on him, during the opera, no turn of it
e&s;caped her: all the comfort &s;he could de|rive
to her&s;elf from tho&s;e ob&s;ervations was,
believing that his attention to Mi&s;s Fitz|Hayman
was forced; and that the &s;olici|tude
with which &s;he her&s;elf was avoided,
aro&s;e, rather from &s;ome remains of tender|ne&s;s,
than from total indifference. "Sure|ly,"
&s;aid &s;he, "if he felt nothing for me,
he would not fly from me, but treat me
with polite indifference; or, with that can|dour
and openne&s;s of heart which u&s;ed to
be &s;o natural to him; he would avow his
de&s;igns, and give his rea&s;ons for them; for
he knows, that be his intentions or his mo|tives
what they may, I &s;hall never reproach
<PB N="300" REF="310">
him; but, whatever I may feel for my&s;elf,
rejoice, if he can find happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Thus, the real affection of her heart for
Willoughby, counteracted the effect of that
native pride and dignity of &s;oul, which,
under other circum&s;tances, would have &s;up|ported
her; and even of his quitting her,
without finding that unan&s;werable rea&s;on
for it, which was once &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t,
&s;he thought rather in &s;orrow, than in
anger.</P>
<P>The morning came, joyle&s;s and unintere&s;t|ing
to her&mdash;&s;he expected nothing but a re|petition
of common, irk&s;ome occurrences,
with the &s;u&s;pen&s;e and mi&s;ery of not hearing
from Willoughby.&mdash;Lady Horatia's re|mon&s;trance&mdash;Montague
Thorold's &s;ilent,
but a&s;&s;iduous attendance&mdash;company whom
&s;he wi&s;hed not to &s;ee&mdash;or parties abroad
that could afford her no plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The day, and another and another, wore
away, and &s;till no letter from Willoughby
arrived&mdash;the forlorn hope, which &s;he had
till now fondly, cheri&s;hed, that he &s;till re|tained
<PB N="301" REF="311">
a lingering preference for her in his
heart, now faded away; and an almo&s;t certain
conviction &s;ucceeded, that he not only
quitted her for ever, but di&s;claimed her
even as a friend; and gave her up in &s;ilent
contempt, without either offering her the
protection of a relation, or feeling for her
the regret which the lo&s;s of a plea&s;ant ac|quaintance
would once, &s;he thought, have
given him.</P>
<P>She repented &s;he had concealed the let|ter
&s;he had written from Lady Horatia
Howard; and while &s;he was con&s;cious that
&s;he ought to have no re&s;erves towards her,
&s;he felt, that in her pre&s;ent anxious &s;tate of
&s;u&s;pen&s;e, it would be &s;ome con&s;olation to
talk it over with her friend. But far from
&s;oothing her with hope, and attempting to
account for the &s;ilent neglect of Willough|by,
by any means that might palliate its
cruelty, Lady Horatia exhorted her, more
earne&s;tly than ever, to call off her thoughts
from a man, who was con&s;idered in every
light &s;o unworthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s them: and,
<PB N="302" REF="312">
&s;he urged, more earne&s;tly than &s;he had
ever yet done, her wi&s;hes, that the tender
and generous attachment of Montague
Thorold might be immediately rewarded.</P>
<P>Though to the nece&s;&s;ity of giving her|&s;elf
to another, Cele&s;tina could by no means
agree, yet &s;he felt, that &s;he mu&s;t either
learn to think with more calmne&s;s of her
eternal &s;eparation from Willoughby, or &s;ink
under it&mdash;for &s;uch pain as the undecided
wretchedne&s;s of the la&s;t two or three days
had given her, human nature could not
long &s;u&s;tain. She promi&s;ed Lady Horatia
that &s;he would endeavour to regain her tran|quillity;
but be&s;ought her, for a day or
two, to excu&s;e her from mixing with com|pany;
and that in the mean time nothing
might be &s;aid to Montague Thorold, to give
him more encouragement than he had al|ready
received. From the looks of Wil|loughby,
when he had &s;een her with him;
and from his pre&s;ent di&s;dainful &s;ilence, &s;he
&s;uppo&s;ed that he believed her engaged to
him, and either re&s;ented her having enter|ed
<PB N="303" REF="313">
into &s;uch an engagement, without con|&s;ulting
him, or &s;till felt &s;ome pain in be|lieving
&s;he had given her&s;elf to another&mdash;of
which, &s;he could not help owning, there
was every appearance, from their being &s;o
frequently together; and from the report
which had gone forth, which her protec|tre&s;s
had not only left uncontradicted, but
had rather encouraged. Of Montague
Thorold, therefore, &s;he now thought with
concern and di&s;quiet, as being partly the
cau&s;e of the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he &s;uffered from
the certainty which every hour in its flight
confirmed, that Willoughby had taken
leave of her for ever.</P>
