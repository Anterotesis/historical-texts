<P>HOGARTH's MARRIAGE-A-LA-MODE has before furni&s;hed Materials to the Au|thor of a Novel, publi&s;hed &s;ome Years ago, un|der the Title of <HI>The Marriage-Act:</HI> But as that Writer per&s;ued a very different Story, and as his Work was chiefly de&s;igned for a Political Satire, very little U&s;e could be made of it for the Service of this Comedy.</P>
<P>In Ju&s;tice to the Per&s;on, who has been con|&s;idered as the &s;ole Author, the Party, who has hitherto lain concealed, thinks it incumbent on him to declare, that the Di&s;clo&s;ure of his Name was, by his own De&s;ire, re&s;erved till the Publication of the Piece.</P>
<P>Both the Authors, however, who have be|fore been &s;eparately honoured with the indul|gence of the Publick, now beg Leave to make their joint Acknowledgements for the very favourable Reception of the CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE.</P>

<L>POETS and Painters, who from Nature draw</L>
<L>Their be&s;t and riche&s;t Stores, have made this Law:</L>
<L>That each &s;hould neighbourly a&s;&s;i&s;t his Brother,</L>
<L>And &s;teal with Decency from one another.</L>
<L>To-night, your matchle&s;s Hogarth gives the Thought,</L>
<L>Which from his Canvas to the Stage is brought.</L>
<L>And who &s;o fit to warm the Poet's Mind,</L>
<L>As he who pictur'd Morals and Mankind?</L>
<L>But not the &s;ame their Characters and Scenes;</L>
<L>Both labour for one End, by different Means:</L>
<L>Each, as it &s;uits him, takes a &s;eparate Road,</L>
<L>Their one great Object, MARRIAGE-A-LA-MODE!</L>
<L>Where Titles deign with Cits to have and hold,</L>
<L>And change rich Blood for more &s;ub&s;tantial Gold!</L>
<L>And honour'd Trade from Intere&s;t turns a&s;ide,</L>
<L>To hazard Happine&s;s for titled Pride.</L>
<L>The Painter dead, yet &s;till he charms the Eye;</L>
<L>While England lives, his Fame can never die:</L>
<L>But he, who <HI>&s;truts his Hour upon the Stage,</HI></L>
<L>Can &s;carce extend his Fame for Half an Age;</L>
<L>Nor Pen nor Pencil can the Actor &s;ave,</L>
<L>The Art, and Arti&s;t, &s;hare one common Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O let me drop one tributary Tear,</L>
<L>On poor <HI>Jack Fal&s;taff</HI>'s Grave, and <HI>Juliet</HI>'s Bier!</L>
<L>You to their Worth mu&s;t Te&s;timony give;</L>
<L>'Tis in your Hearts alone their Fame can live.</L>
<L>Still as the Scenes of Life will &s;hift away,</L>
<L>The &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ions of their Art decay.</L>
<L>Your Children cannot feel what you have known;</L>
<L>They'll boa&s;t of QUINS and CIBBERS of their own:</L>
<L>The greate&s;t Glory of our happy few,</L>
<L>Is to be felt, and be approv'd by YOU.</L>

<P>Dear Ma'am, you may depend upon me. There is not a more tru&s;tier creature on the face of the earth, than I am. Though I &s;ay it, I am as &s;e|cret as the grave&mdash;and if it's never told, till I tell it, it may remain untold till doom's-day for Betty.</P>

<P>Well&mdash;&s;ay no more of this&mdash;It makes me unea&s;y&mdash;All I have to a&s;k of you, is to be faithful and &s;ecret, and not to reveal this matter, till we di&s;clo&s;e it to the family our&s;elves.</P>

<P>My love!&mdash;How's this?&mdash;In tears?&mdash;Indeed this is too much.

Why will you &s;tudy to add to our unea&s;ine&s;s and perplexity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mr. Lovewell! the indelicacy of a &s;ecret marriage grows every day more and more &s;hock|ing to me. I walk about the hou&s;e like a guilty wretch: I imagine my&s;elf the object of the &s;u&s;picion
<PB N="4" REF="9">
of the whole family; and am under the perpetual terrors of a &s;hameful detection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, indeed, you are to blame. The amiable delicacy of your temper, and your quick &s;en&s;ibility, only &s;erve to make you unhappy.&mdash;To clear up this affair properly to Mr. Sterling, is the continual employment of my thoughts. Every thing now is in a fair train. It begins to grow ripe for a di&s;covery; and I have no doubt of its concluding to the &s;atisfaction of our&s;elves, of your father, and the whole family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>End how it will, I am re&s;olved it &s;hall end &s;oon&mdash;very &s;oon.&mdash;I wou'd not live another week in this agony of mind to be mi&s;tre&s;s of the univer&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be too violent neither. Do not let us di&s;turb the joy of your &s;i&s;ter's marriage with the tumult this matter may occa&s;ion!&mdash;I have brought letters from Lord Ogleby and Sir John Melvil to Mr. Sterling.&mdash;They will be here this evening&mdash;and, I dare &s;ay, within this hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter&mdash;Only let us di&s;clo&s;e our marri|age immediately!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>As &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>But directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a few days, you may depend on it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>To-night&mdash;or to-morrow morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, I fear, will be impracticable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but you mu&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mu&s;t! why?</P>

<P>Indeed, you mu&s;t.&mdash;I have the mo&s;t alarm|ing rea&s;ons for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alarming indeed! for they alarm me, even before I am acquainted with them&mdash;What are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not tell me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at pre&s;ent. When all is &s;ettled, you &s;hall be acquainted with every thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sorry they are coming!&mdash;Mu&s;t be di&s;|covered!&mdash;What can this mean!&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible you can have any rea&s;ons that need be concealed from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not di&s;turb your&s;elf with conjectures&mdash;but re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that though you are unable to di|vine the cau&s;e, the con&s;equence of a di&s;covery, be it what it will, cannot be attended with half the mi&s;eries of the pre&s;ent interval.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You put me upon the rack.&mdash;I wou'd do any thing to make you ea&s;y.&mdash;But you know your father's temper.&mdash;Money (you will excu&s;e my frank|ne&s;s) is the &s;pring of all his actions, which nothing but the idea of acquiring nobility or magnificence can ever make him forego&mdash;and the&s;e he thinks his money will purcha&s;e.&mdash;You know too your aunt's, Mrs. Heidelberg's, notions of the &s;plendor of high life, her contempt for every thing that does not reli&s;h of what &s;he calls Quality, and that from the va&s;t fortune in her hands, by her late hu&s;band, &s;he ab&s;olutely governs Mr. Sterling and the whole family: now, if they &s;hould come to the knowledge of this affair too abruptly, they might, perhaps, be incen&s;ed beyond all hopes of reconciliation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if they are made acquainted with it otherwi&s;e than by our&s;elves, it will be ten times wor&s;e: and a di&s;covery grows every day more pro|bable. The whole family have long &s;u&s;pected our affection. We are al&s;o in the power of a fooli&s;h maid-&s;ervant; and if we may even depend on her fidelity, we cannot an&s;wer for her di&s;cretion.&mdash;Di&s;|cover it therefore immediately, le&s;t &s;ome accident &s;hould bring it to light, and involve us in additional di&s;grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;well&mdash;I meant to di&s;cover it &s;oon, but would not do it too precipitately.&mdash;I have more than once &s;ounded Mr. Sterling about it, and will attempt him more &s;eriou&s;ly the next opportunity. But my principal hopes are the&s;e.&mdash;My relation&s;hip
<PB N="6" REF="11">
to Lord Ogleby, and his having placed me with your father, have been, you know, the fir&s;t links in the chain of this connection between the two families; in con&s;equence of which, I am at pre&s;ent in high favour with all parties: while they all remain thus well-affected to me, I propo&s;e to lay our ca&s;e before the old Lord; and if I can prevail on him to me|diate in this affair, I make no doubt but he will be able to appea&s;e your father; and, being a lord and a man of quality, I am &s;ure he may bring Mrs. Heidelberg into good-humour at any time.&mdash;Let me beg you, therefore, to have but a little patience, as, you &s;ee, we are upon the very eve of a di&s;covery, that mu&s;t probably be to our advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Manage it your own way. I am per|&s;uaded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in the mean time make your&s;elf ea&s;y.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>As ea&s;y as I can, I will.&mdash;We had better not remain together any longer at pre&s;ent.&mdash;Think of this bu&s;ine&s;s, and let me know how you proceed.</P>

I &s;pare no expence, not I.&mdash;This is quite another-gue&s;s &s;ort of a place than it was when I fir&s;t took it, my Lord. We were &s;urrounded with trees. I cut down above fifty to make the lawn before the hou&s;e, and let in the wind and the &s;un&mdash;&s;mack-&s;mooth&mdash;as you &s;ee.&mdash;Then I made a green-hou&s;e out of the old laundry,

It commands the whole road. All the coaches and chariots, and chai&s;es, pa&s;s and repa&s;s under your eye. I'll mount you up there in the afternoon, my Lord.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true. I came into the family with|out any impre&s;&s;ions on my mind&mdash;with an unim|pa&s;&s;ioned indifference ready to receive one woman as &s;oon as another. I looked upon love, &s;erious, &s;ober love, as a chimaera, and marriage as a thing of cour&s;e, as you know mo&s;t people do. But I, who was lately &s;o great an infidel in love, am now one of its &s;incere&s;t votaries.&mdash;In &s;hort, my defection from Mi&s;s Sterling proceeds from the violence of my attachment to another.</P>

<P>Not think of it? I can think of nothing el&s;e.

<P>You have gone too far to recede. A negotiation, &s;o nearly concluded, cannot be broken off with any grace. The lawyers, you know, are hourly expected; the preliminaries almo&s;t finally &s;ettled between Lord Ogleby and Mr. Sterling; and Mi&s;s Sterling her&s;elf ready to receive you as a hu&s;band.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why the banns have been publi&s;hed, and nobody has forbidden them, 'tis true. But you know either of the parties may change their minds even after they enter the church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think too lightly of this matter. To carry your addre&s;&s;es &s;o far&mdash;and then to de&s;ert her&mdash;and for her &s;i&s;ter too!&mdash;It will be &s;uch an affront to the family, that they can never put up with it.</P>

<P>I don't think &s;o: for as to my transfer|ring my pa&s;&s;ion from her to her &s;i&s;ter, &s;o much the better&punc;&mdash;for then, you know, I don't carry my af|fections out of the family.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that now&mdash;why that&mdash;that is ju&s;t&mdash;ju&s;t as it may &s;trike different people. There are many admirers of Mi&s;s Sterling's vivacity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Vivacity! a medley of Cheap&s;ide pert|ne&s;s, and Whitechapel pride.&mdash;No&mdash;no&mdash;if I do go &s;o far into the city for a wedding-dinner, it &s;hall be upon turtle at lea&s;t.</P>

<P>But I &s;ee no probability of &s;ucce&s;s; for granting that Mr. Sterling wou'd have con&s;ented to it at fir&s;t, he cannot li&s;ten to it now. Why did not you break this affair to the family before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under &s;uch embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances as I have been, can you wonder at my irre&s;olution or perplexity? Nothing but de&s;pair, the fear of lo&s;ing my dear Fanny, cou'd bring me to a declaration

Will Sir John take Fanny without a fortune? No.&mdash;After you have &s;ettled the large&s;t part of your property on your younge&s;t daughter, can there be an equal portion left for the elde&s;t? No.&mdash;Does not this overturn the whole &s;y&s;tum of the fammaly? Yes, yes, yes. You know I was always for my niece Bet&s;ey's marrying a per&s;on of the very fir&s;t quallaty. That was my maxum. And, therefore, much the large&s;t &s;ettle|ment was of cour&s;e to be made upon her.&mdash;As for Fanny, if &s;he could, with a fortune of twenty or thirty thou&s;and pounds, get a knight, or a member of parliament, or a rich common-council-man for a hu&s;band, I thought it might do very well.</P>

<P>Indeed, Sir, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the tortures I have already endured in con&s;equence of my di&s;obedience.

<P>And if they do, I will receive them into mine. Look ye, Mr. Sterling, there have been &s;ome
<PB N="89" REF="94">
mi&s;takes, which we had all better forget for our own &s;akes; and the be&s;t way to forget them is to forgive the cau&s;e of them; which I do from my &s;oul.&mdash;Poor girl! I &s;wore to &s;upport her affection with my life and fortune;&mdash;'tis a debt of honour, and mu&s;t be paid&mdash;you &s;wore as much too, Mr. Sterling; but your laws in the city will excu&s;e <HI>you,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e; for you never &s;trike a ballance without errors excepted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a father, my Lord; but for the &s;ake of all other fathers, I think I ought not to forgive her, for fear of encouraging other &s;illy girls like her&s;elf to throw them&s;elves away without the con&s;ent of their parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope there will be no danger of that, Sir. Young ladies with minds, like my Fanny's, would &s;tartle at the very &s;hadow of vice; and when they know to what unea&s;ine&s;s only an indi&s;cretion has expo&s;ed her, her example, in&s;tead, of encouraging, will rather &s;erve to deter them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Heidel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indi&s;cretion, quoth a! a mighty pretty delicat word to expre&s;s di&s;obedience!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I indulge my own pa&s;&s;ions too much to tyrannize over tho&s;e of other people. Poor &s;ouls, I pity them. And you mu&s;t forgive them too. Come, come, melt a little of your flint, Mr. Sterling!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Heidel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The girl's ruined, and I forgive her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;&s;o do I then.&mdash;Nay, no thanks&mdash; <STAGE>[to Lovewell and Fanny, who &s;eem preparing to &s;peak]</STAGE> there's an end of the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Lovewell, what makes you dumb all this while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your kindne&s;s, my Lord&mdash;I can &s;carce believe my own &s;en&s;es&mdash;they are all in a tumult of fear, joy, love, expectation, and gratitude; I ever was, and am now more bound in duty to your Lord|&s;hip;
<PB N="90" REF="95">
for you, Mr. Sterling, if every moment of my life, &s;pent gratefully in your &s;ervice, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ate the want of fortune, you perhaps will not repent your goodne&s;s to me. And you, ladies, I flatter my&s;elf, will not for the future &s;u&s;pect me of artifice and intrigue&mdash;I &s;hall be happy to oblige, and &s;erve you.&mdash;As for you, Sir John&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No apologies to me, Lovewell, I do not de&s;erve any. All I have to offer in excu&s;e for what has happened, is my total ignorance of your &s;itua|tion. Had you dealt a little more openly with me, you would have &s;aved me, and your&s;elf, and that lady, (who I hope will pardon my behaviour) a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s. Give me leave, however, to a&s;&s;ure you, that light and capricious as I may have ap|peared, now my infatuation is over, I have &s;en&s;ibility enough to be a&s;hamed of the part I have acted, and honour enough to rejoice at your happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t Fanny, though we are &s;eemingly the happie&s;t of beings, yet all our joys will be dampt, if his Lord&s;hip's genero&s;ity and Mr. Sterling's forgivene&s;s &s;hould not be &s;ucceeded by the indulgence, approbation, and con&s;ent of the&s;e our be&s;t benefactors. <STAGE>[To the audience.</STAGE></P>
