<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Play of <HI>Liberty A&s;&s;erted,</HI> is by the right of Nature Yours, not only as You are a zealous Lover of Your Country, and a generous A&s;&s;ertor of Liberty, but as it owes its Birth and its very Being to You. For it was You, Sir, who gave the happy Hint upon which this Poem was form'd; from You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> from a Source of noble Sentiments it de&s;cended to Me, and 'tis from Me that with a ju&s;t Ambition it a&s;cends to You.</P>
<P>If I had had the Happine&s;s to be nearer to You during the time that I was writing this Tragedy; if, as I at fir&s;t receiv'd the Hint from You, I could have receiv'd Your In&s;tructions about the De&s;ign and the Working of the Scenes, the Faults in this Poem had then been fewer; and the Pre&s;ent more worthy You. But I know that the Noblene&s;s of Your Engli&s;h Prin|ciples will oblige You to excu&s;e its Faults, on Con|&s;ideration of the ju&s;t Intention with the which it was writ; and that was no le&s;s than to do good to Your Country; to open the Eyes of deluded Men, to in|&s;pire them with the Love of Liberty, and unite and animate them again&s;t the Common Foe of <HI>Europe.</HI> But yet, if at la&s;t I did not flatter my &s;elf that this
<PB REF="6">
Play had many more Beauties than Faults, You &s;hould be the very la&s;t Per&s;on to whom I would chu&s;e to addre&s;s it. If You appear to be of the &s;ame Opinion, I have gain'd the chief Ends which I propo&s;e to my &s;elf in Writing, and that is to do a little Good, to di&s;tingui&s;h my &s;elf by what I write, and by tho&s;e to whom I addre&s;s my &s;elf. I &s;hall look upon Your Approbation as a glorious Earne&s;t of Fame, for Truth will be &s;ure at la&s;t to prevail; and that which we call Ta&s;te in Writing, is nothing but a fine Di&s;cern|ment of Truth. But as Truth mu&s;t be always one, and always the &s;ame to all who have Eyes to di&s;cern it; he who plea&s;es one of a true Ta&s;te at fir&s;t, is &s;ure of plea&s;ing all the World at la&s;t. But I who have &s;ometimes had the Honour to hear You talk of Critici&s;m, have been a long time throughly con|vinc'd that from an Intimacy with the Ancients, and a ju&s;t Knowledge of the Moderns, You have form'd that fine and admirable Ta&s;te, which is &s;o rarely found among us. But I ought to con&s;ider that while I commend it, I may perhaps di&s;plea&s;e it, and ought in Di&s;cretion to &s;ay no more. I am,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Entertainments of our Theatres are publick, and &s;upported by publick Authority, it is but ju&s;t that the In&s;truction, which is the ultimate end of them, &s;hould tend to the publick Advantage. 'Tis true, indeed, the Stage, by correcting particular Per&s;ons, has a natural tendency to the improving the Publick. But when, I &s;ay, that the Publick ought to receive Advantage from the Entertainments of our Thea|tres, I mean, that it ought to do &s;o immediately, and that the In|&s;tructions which we receive from the Stage ought to be for the Be|nefit of the lawful e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government.</P>
<P>That this was the Ca&s;e among the <HI>Athenians</HI> appears plain to me; and the rea&s;on why they &s;ettled &s;o va&s;t a Fund upon the Tragick Stage, was becau&s;e they regarded it as the very Barrier of Liberty, which it &s;upported by expo&s;ing the Misfortunes of Ty|rants, and the Calamities that attended upon Arbitrary Pow'r. And it &s;eems to me to be for this rea&s;on that they had that high E&s;teem for <HI>Oedipus,</HI> and were at &s;o uncommon an Expence in the Decoration of it, becau&s;e both the Crimes and the Calamities of <HI>Oe|dipus</HI> were the Con&s;equences of his a&s;&s;uming unlimited Pow'r. 'Tis true, he kill'd his Father before he came to be King, but it was by a&s;cending the Throne that he committed Ince&s;t, and that he came to the knowledge of what he had done; and had he continued a private Man, he had neither known the Guilt of his Actions, nor had he felt the Puni&s;hment of them.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Athenians</HI> had Liberty with a Common-wealth, the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> enjoy the very &s;ame Liberty under the Government of the be&s;t of Queens, and in &s;o doing are the happie&s;t People in the World. I thought therefore that I could not do a thing that would be more acceptable to all true Engli&s;hmen, than to ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in my Mite towards the defending and &s;upporting of that Liberty.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
That the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and of this I&s;land particularly, are in no &s;mall Danger at pre&s;ent from the growing Power of <HI>France,</HI> will be ea&s;ily granted by all but &s;uch who are either Fools or Knaves too incorrigible to be talk'd too. But this is plain, that they are not &s;o much in danger, from what &s;ome call the Greatne&s;s of the <HI>French,</HI> as from the Ba&s;ene&s;s of the re&s;t of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> If we were but as true to Liberty, as the <HI>French</HI> are to Tyranny, they would &s;oon be as de&s;picable in their Circum&s;tances as they are now in their Principles. 'Tis the want of publick Spi|rit that ruins us, and the De&s;ign of this Tragedy is to inculcate that, this being its important Moral; that the want of publick Spirit in the Members of any Community makes not only the publick, but very often tho&s;e private Per&s;ons who want it&punc; very unhappy; that whoeven &s;ells or betrays his Country either to a foreign Tyrant, as &s;ome of the Confederates, or to a home-bred one, as the whole Bo|dy of the <HI>French</HI> do; whoever does this upon the account of ad|vancing his Family, which is the general Motive to &s;uch publick Trea&s;ons, is &s;ure to have him&s;elf and his Family &s;uffer with the re&s;t, and perhaps with the foremo&s;t. And this Moral is prov'd by the Dramatick Action both ways. It &s;hews a Man who makes a Treaty with the <HI>French</HI> upon private Intere&s;t, made by that Treaty the mo&s;t wretched of Mankind, of the happie&s;t that he was before; and it &s;hews the very Frenchman who breaks it, about to be plung'd by the Breach of it, in the mo&s;t deplorable Calamity; and it &s;hews &s;omething farther too, that the <HI>French,</HI> who are the In&s;truments of promoting Tyranny upon a private Intere&s;t, are &s;o only becau&s;e they are &s;o far blinded by their Pa&s;&s;ions, that they know not what they do; that is, they know not that they are &s;acrificing to their Tyrant their very Children and Families, for who&s;e Support they pretend to act; that if their other Pa&s;&s;ions did not conccal this from them, all of them who have any thing of natural Affection, would be &s;o far from being guilty of &s;o unnatural a Villany, that they would immediately declare for Liberty.</P>
<P>Some People may perhaps admire, that I who have been accus'd of repeating the &s;ame thing in the Play, the Prologue and Epilogue, &s;hould yet appear to be farther guilty of that very Fault in the Preface. To whom I an&s;wer, That &s;ince after all the Care I had taken in the Play, the Prologue and Epilogue, to a&s;&s;ure the World
<PB REF="7">
that this was an Engli&s;h and not a Party Play; there were &s;ome malicious enough to affirm that this was a Play writ pur|po&s;ely to oblige the Whigs, I thought it lay upon me to prove what I had affirm'd before, that this was not a Whig but an Engli&s;h Play, which I &s;hall manife&s;tly, I believe, make out, un|le&s;s they will urge, that becau&s;e it is an Engli&s;h therefore it is a Whiggi&s;h Play.</P>
<P>If this Play is writ for a Party, why then it mu&s;t be writ again&s;t a Party. Now it will be pretty plain from what has been &s;aid above, con&s;idered with the Play it &s;elf, that the De&s;ign of this Tragedy is to make Men in Love with Liberty, by &s;hewing them that nothing can be more according to Nature, and by &s;hewing this not by &s;uch forcible and extra|ordinary Arguments as require more than ordinary Penetration to be under&s;tood, for that has been already done &s;o incompara|bly by Mr. <HI>Lock</HI> that nothing need or can be added to it; but by &s;omething &s;o plain that ev'ry Under&s;tanding is capable of it, and that is, by the mo&s;t Tender of all Sentiments which Nature has implanted in the Minds of Men, and that is, the Love of their Children. The Party therefore that this Play was writ to oblige, are all tho&s;e who have any concern for their Country, their Religion, their Relations, their Friends and their Children; and the Party it was writ again&s;t, are all tho&s;e who care not one farthing for any or all of the&s;e. Now I would give a good deal to behold &s;o abominable a Wretch as to own him&s;elf of &s;uch a Party.</P>
<P>He who writes for a Party writes for Intere&s;t; now I would fain ask any one where can be my Intere&s;t in writing for the Party for which it is &s;uppo&s;ed that I write. The fir&s;t thing that I wrote which had relation to the Publick was a Poem call'd <HI>The Court of Death,</HI> in which I lamented the Death of the late Queen of happy and glorious Memory. And tho' both the De&s;ign and Spirit of that Poem were thought by &s;ome of the be&s;t Judges, to be above the common level of Poetry, yet I was almo&s;t the only Per&s;on of all the Writers who appear'd upon that Subject, of whom the Court took no notice. My Friends can bear me Witne&s;s that I was &s;o far from being mortified at it, that I was re&s;olv'd to per&s;evere in what I thought my Duty, and of all the fore&s;aid Writers I was afterwards
<PB REF="8">
the only Per&s;on who bewail'd the Death of the late King in the &s;ame publick manner that I had before lamented that of his Royal Con&s;ort. I had almo&s;t the &s;ame Fortune with that Poem that I had with the former: It brought me indeed a little more Repu|tation, but ju&s;t as much Advantage.</P>
<P>He who after this could be induc'd to expect any thing from tho&s;e whom they call the Whigs, mu&s;t be of a more &s;anguine Temper than I am. I know indeed that there are a great many People whom they call Whigs, who are really Engli&s;hmen, and to oblige Engli&s;hmen I &s;hall be always proud, by what Names &s;oever they may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; By a real Engli&s;hman I mean one who is for the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, and the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, upon the view of the good of his Countrey, and his own no farther than as it depends on the other.</P>
<P>But upon the fir&s;t acting this Tragedy there were not wanting &s;ome worthy Per&s;ons who made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to report about the Town that it was a Republican Play. Now to give them an An&s;wer to which nothing can be replyed, I have ordered the la&s;t Scene of the Play to be printed, which on the account of Length was left out in Acting, tho' it yet remains in the Play-hou&s;e-copy. At the &s;ame time I de&s;ire the Reader to believe, that I am not &s;uch a Fool to contend for Names but for Things; that Liberty is Liberty under a limited Monarchy, as much as under a Common-wealth; that we enjoy enough under the pre&s;ent Queen to make us the happie&s;t of People; that I have as high a Venera|tion for Her as any Subject She has, and would venture as much to &s;erve Her, becau&s;e I am perfectly convinc'd, that all that She aims at by Her perpetual Care and the Wi&s;dom of Her Conduct, is to &s;up|port and defend the&s;e Liberties which Her glorious Predece&s;&s;our deliver'd to us; and which 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Play to a&s;&s;ert and vindicate. So that the De&s;ign of this Tragedy being only to pro|mote the good Intentions of the Queen, it is more Her Intere&s;t than it is any Per&s;ons in <HI>England</HI> that it &s;hould make the Impre&s;|&s;ion which it was de&s;ign'd to make; tho' I believe it at the &s;ame time to be the Intere&s;t of ev'ry Per&s;on in <HI>England,</HI> excepting tho&s;e who are wi&s;hing for a French Government or contriving to bring it in.</P>
<P>This is not the fir&s;t time that &s;ince Her Maje&s;ties happy Acce&s;&s;ion
<PB REF="9">
to Her Throne I have endeavour'd to &s;erve Her. And all the world knows that it is not my Fault that I have not done Her a mo&s;t important Service. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Propo&s;al for putting a &s;peedy end to the War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;old by Mrs. <HI>Baldwin.</HI></NOTE> Had that been done, there had been no need of writing the following Tragedy. There had been no need of firing People with the Love of Liberty, or animating them a|gain&s;t the common Foe. Had that been done the Liberties of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> and our own had been &s;ufficiently &s;ecur'd.</P>
<P>I know very well that the foregoing Declaration is not over politick; that to declare for the Publick again&s;t Parties is to make no Friends. I am perfectly convinc'd that if I could be brought to e&s;pou&s;e any Party warmly, that Party might be brought to e&s;pou&s;e me, but that till I make that &s;tep I mu&s;t be left to my &s;elf; of this, I &s;ay, I am perfectly convinc'd, and yet not|with&s;tanding that Conviction, I hope in God I &s;hall not change my Conduct.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;s of this Play has been &s;o favourable notwith&s;tanding Malice and ill Accidents; it has had the Felicity of having &s;o many illu&s;trious Voices for it, that I may &s;pare my &s;elf the Trouble of an&s;wering Objections. However, &s;ince good Manners appear to be concern'd in two of them, I &s;hall &s;ay a word to tho&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, that there are in this Play National Reflections, which ought not to be made. To which I an&s;wer, that I plainly perceive that the Art of the following Tragedy is by no means all under&s;tood. That part of it con&s;i&s;ts in this, that what &s;ome mi|&s;take for a National Satyr, is only a Satyr upon Arbitrary Power, a Satyr upon the Government of the French, and not upon their Manners as they proceed from their Climate. The French are in them|&s;elves a brave and a gallant Nation; but the Submi&s;&s;ion which they fondly pay to unlimited Power has plung'd them in Vices which their Natures abhor, and render'd them odious and de&s;picable. To &s;hew this, I have introduced the Characters of two Frenchmen, <HI>Frontenac</HI> and <HI>Miramont,</HI> who are both of them Men of Honour; but the difference between them is this, that <HI>Miramont,</HI> who de|clares again&s;t Arbitrary Pow'r, is altogether without Blemi&s;h, and the Faults and Defects in <HI>Frontenac</HI>'s Character, are plainly deriv'd
<PB REF="10">
from his Zeal for their pre&s;ent Government.</P>
<P>The other Objection is this, that the Satyr in the Amba&s;&s;adors Scene is too cour&s;e for delicate Ears. I know it very well, and in complai&s;ance to &s;ome Gentlemen whom I e&s;teem, I order'd it to be left out after the fir&s;t Night, but I have printed it with the re&s;t becau&s;e they who do not like it may turn over it, and becau&s;e it is likely to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the end for which this Poem was writ, and that is, to animate our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again&s;t the <HI>French</HI>; for I believe it may not be unacceptable to &s;ome hone&s;t downright Engli&s;hmen, who while we and the <HI>French</HI> are cutting one anothers Throats, will not take it ill, that we do it without Ceremony.</P>
<P>The Scene of this Tragedy lies at <HI>Agnie</HI> in <HI>Canada</HI>; which, for the &s;ake of the better &s;ound, I call <HI>Angie. Canada</HI> is a va&s;t Tract of Land in <HI>Northern America,</HI> on the Back of <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>New York.</HI> As <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>New York,</HI> and the Coun|try about them belong to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a con&s;iderable part of <HI>Ca|nada</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>French</HI>; and as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> divide the Country, they divide the Natives. The mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable Nation of <HI>Canada,</HI> next to the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> are the <HI>Hurons,</HI> who are Friends to the <HI>French.</HI> But the five Warlike Nations of the <HI>Iroquois</HI> are our Confederates; of tho&s;e five Nations, <HI>Agnies</HI> or <HI>Angies</HI> is one; and the chief Place of the Nation is <HI>Agnie</HI> or <HI>Angie,</HI> and thus much I thought fit to premi&s;e for the Sake of tho&s;e who have never read either <HI>Hennepin</HI> or <HI>La Hontan.</HI></P>
<P>But now it will be convenient to &s;ay a word concerning the Scenes as they are mark'd in the printed Play, and here&punc; by the word Scene, I do not mean &s;o much the Place, as the Number of Per&s;ons who are in Action upon that Place at a time. I have therefore di&s;tingui&s;h'd the Scenes in the following Play, as they have been always di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Ancients and by the Moderns of other Countries, and by our own <HI>Ben. John&s;on.</HI> Any Per&s;on who comes upon the Place of Action, or leaves it, makes a different Scene, and that new Scene is mark'd by the Figure of its re&s;pe|ctive Number, and the Names of the Per&s;ons who are upon the Place of Action. I thought that agreeable Delu&s;ion into which the Reader willingly and gladly enters, for the &s;ake of his Plea|&s;ure, would be both greater and ea&s;ier if he were not put in mind
<PB REF="11">
of a Stage by <HI>Entrances</HI> and <HI>Exits,</HI> which are nothing but Dire|rections that are given to a Play Hou&s;e Prompter.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of this Play was much improv'd by the Remon&s;trances which I receiv'd from my valued Friend Mr. <HI>Southern,</HI> who be&s;ides his Zeal to do good to his Friends, and a noble Sincerity, uncommon among the Writers of this Age, by the <HI>ex tempore</HI> Re|marks which he made upon my reading this Play to him in a very ha&s;ty manner, &s;hew'd at once &s;o much penetrating Quickne&s;s, as well as &s;o much Solidity, and &s;o much &s;urene&s;s, as could belong to no Man but one who has a thorough Under&s;tanding of Nature, and who has that admirable Talent for touching the Pa&s;&s;ions which he has &s;hewn in his Tragedies. I mu&s;t own the Obligation too which I have to Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> for the Hints I received from him, as well as for his excellent Action.</P>
<P>This Play indeed receiv'd all the Grace and Ornament of A|ction in mo&s;t of the principal Parts, and in all the Womens. But that of <HI>Sakia</HI> by Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> was acted &s;o admirably and inimita|bly, as that no Stage in <HI>Europe</HI> can boa&s;t of any thing that comes near to her Performance; or if the Foreign Stages can &s;hew any thing like it, they are at lea&s;t prodigiou&s;ly improv'd &s;ince I was upon the Continent. That incomparable Actre&s;s changing like Nature which &s;he repre&s;ents, from Pa&s;&s;ion to Pa&s;&s;ion, from Extream to Extream, with piercing Force, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Grace, changes the Hearts of all who &s;ee her with irre&s;i&s;tible Plea&s;ure.</P>
