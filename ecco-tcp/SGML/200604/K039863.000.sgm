<P><HI>THE Reverend Mr. White,</HI> &s;o agreeably
known to the public by his <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory
of Selborne,</HI> left behind him a &s;eries of yearly
books, containing his diurnal ob&s;ervations
on the occurrences in the various walks of
rural nature, from the year 1768 to the time
of his death in 1793. From the&s;e annals he
had already extracted all the matter com|prized
in the work above mentioned, down
to the middle of 1787; but &s;everal curious
facts in the preceding numbers had not been
thus employed; and all the &s;ub&s;equent ones
remained untouched. It was thought a mark
of re&s;pect due to his memory, and to the re|putation
he had acquired as a faithful and
elegant ob&s;erver, not to con&s;ign the&s;e relicks
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
to neglect. The manu&s;cripts were accord|ingly
put into my hands for the purpo&s;e of
&s;electing from them what might &s;eem worthy
of laying before the public. The pre&s;ent
&s;mall publication is the fruit of my re&s;earch.
With no &s;mall pains I collected the mate|rials
of it, di&s;per&s;ed through the records of
&s;o many years, and gave them &s;uch an ar|rangement
as I thought would pre&s;ent them
in the mo&s;t agreeable and u&s;eful manner to
the lovers of natural knowledge.</P>

<P>THE mode in which the following rural
calendar of the year has been compo&s;ed, was
to copy out from the journals all the cir|cum&s;tances
thought worthy of noting, with
the &s;everal dates of their recurrence, and to
pre&s;erve the earlie&s;t and late&s;t of the&s;e dates;
&s;o that the calendar exhibits the extreme
range of variation in the fir&s;t occurrence of
all the phenomena mentioned. To many
of them only one date is annexed, only one
ob&s;ervation having been entered. This is
particularly the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the
flowering of plants, with which the book of
1768 alone was copiou&s;ly filled; and it is to
be noted that this was rather a backward year.</P>

through &s;uch meteorous turbulencies, as
one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e would embarra&s;s and

<P>When the boys bring me wa&s;ps ne&s;ts, my

becau&s;e &s;ome combs of wa&s;ps happened to

were conveyed thither doubtle&s;s for the &s;ake

<P>MANY creatures are endowed with a ready

Thus my neighbour's poultry watch

Partridges, it is true, roo&s;t on the ground, not

<HEAD>A HYBRID PHEASANT.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Stawell &s;ent me from the great
lodge in the holt a curious bird for my in|&s;pection.
It was found by the &s;paniels of
one of his keepers in a coppice, and &s;hot on
the wing. The &s;hape, and air, and habit
of the bird, and the &s;carlet ring round the
eyes, agreed well with the appearance of a
cock phea&s;ant; but then the head and neck
and brea&s;t and belly were of a glo&s;&s;y black:
and though it weighed 3 lb. 3&frac12; oz.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hen phea&s;ants u&s;ually weigh only 2 lb. 1 oz.</NOTE> the
weight of a large full grown cock phea&s;ant,
yet there were no &s;igns of any &s;purs on the
legs, as is u&s;ual with all grown cock phea|&s;ants,
who have long ones. The legs and
feet were naked of feathers; and therefore it
could be nothing of the grous kind. In
<PB N="66" REF="63">
the tail were no long bending feathers, &s;uch
as cock phea&s;ants u&s;ually have; and are cha|racteri&s;tic
of the &s;ex. The tail was much
&s;horter than the tail of a hen phea&s;ant, and
blunt and &s;quare at the end. The back,
wing-feathers, and tail, were all of a pale
ru&s;&s;et curiou&s;ly &s;treaked, &s;omewhat like the
upper parts of a hen partridge. I returned
it, with my verdict, that it was probably a
&s;purious or hybrid hen bird, bred between
a cock phea&s;ant and &s;ome dome&s;tic fowl.
When I came to talk with the keeper who
brought it, he told me that &s;ome peahens had
been known la&s;t &s;ummer to haunt the coppices
and coverts where this mule was found.</P>
<P>Mr. Elmer, of Farnham, the famous game
painter, was employed to take an exact copy
of this curious bird.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It ought to be mentioned, that
&s;ome good judges have imagined this bird to
have been a &s;tray grous or black-cock; it is

that its legs and feet were naked, where|as

<HEAD>LAND RAIL.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN brought me a <HI>land-rail</HI> or <HI>daker-hen,</HI>
a bird &s;o rare in this di&s;trict, that we
&s;eldom &s;ee more than one or two in a &s;ea|&s;on,
and tho&s;e only in autumn. This is
deemed a bird of pa&s;&s;age by all the writers:
yet from its formation &s;eems to be poorly
qualified for migration; for its wings are
&s;hort, and placed &s;o forward, and out of
the centre of gravity, that it flies in a very
heavy and embarra&s;&s;ed manner, with its legs
hanging down; and can hardly be &s;prung a
&s;econd time, as it runs very fa&s;t, and &s;eems
to depend more on the &s;wiftne&s;s of its feet
than on its flying.</P>
<P>When we came to draw it, we found the
<PB N="68" REF="65">
entrails &s;o &s;oft and tender that in appearance
they might have been dre&s;&s;ed like the ropes
of a woodcock. The craw or crop was
&s;mall and lank, containing a mucus; the
gizzard thick and &s;trong, and filled with
&s;mall &s;hell &s;nails, &s;ome whole, and many
ground to pieces through the attrition which
is occa&s;ioned by the mu&s;cular force and mo|tion
of that inte&s;tine. We &s;aw no gravels
among the food: perhaps the &s;hell &s;nails
might perform the functions of gravels or
pebbles, and might grind one another. <HI>Land-rails</HI>

in the low wet bean fields of Chri&s;tian-Malford
in North Wilts, and in the mea|dows
near Paradi&s;e gardens at Oxford, where
I have often heard them cry crex, crex.

when, notwith&s;tanding the report of the gun,
it was immediately pur&s;ued by the blue

but e&s;caped into &s;ome covert. He

the hawk hovering round him all the while

<HEAD>GREAT SPECKLED DIVER, OR LOON.</HEAD>
<P>As one of my neighbours was traver&s;ing
Wolmer fore&s;t from Bram&s;hot acro&s;s the
moors, he found a large uncommon bird
fluttering in the heath, but not wounded,
<PB N="72" REF="69">
which he brought home alive. On exami|nation
it proved to be <HI>Colymbus glacialis
Linn:</HI> the great &s;peckled diver or loon,
which is mo&s;t excellently de&s;cribed in Wil|lughby's
ornithology.</P>
<P>Every part and proportion of this bird
is &s;o incomparably adapted to its mode of
life, that in no in&s;tance do we &s;ee the wi&s;|dom
of God in the creation to more ad|vantage.
The head is &s;harp, and &s;maller
than the part of the neck adjoining, in order
that it may pierce the water; the wings are
placed forward and out of the center of
gravity, for a purpo&s;e which &s;hall be noticed
hereafter; the thighs quite at the podex, in
order to facilitate diving; and the legs are
flat, and as &s;harp backwards almo&s;t as the
edge of a knife, that in &s;triking they may
ea&s;ily cut the water; while the feet are
palmated, and broad for &s;wimming, yet &s;o
<PB N="73" REF="70">
folded up when advanced forward to take
a fre&s;h &s;troke, as to be full as narrow as the
&s;hank. The two exterior toes of the feet
are longe&s;t; the nails flat and broad re|&s;embling
the human, which give &s;trength
and increa&s;e the power of &s;wimming. The
foot, when expanded, is not at right angles
to the leg or body of the bird: but the ex|terior
part inclining towards the head forms
an acute angle with the body; the intention
being not to give motion in the line of the
legs them&s;elves, but by the combined im|pul&s;e
of both in an intermediate line, the line
of the body.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t people know, that have ob&s;erved at
all, that the &s;wimming of birds is nothing
more than a walking in the water, where
one foot &s;ucceeds the other as on the land;
yet no one, as far as I am aware, has re|marked
<PB N="74" REF="71">
that diving fowls, while under water,
impel and row them&s;elves forward by a mo|tion
of their wings, as well as by the impul&s;e
of their feet: but &s;uch is really the ca&s;e, as
any per&s;on may ea&s;ily be convinced who will
ob&s;erve ducks when hunted by dogs in a
clear pond. Nor do I know that any one
has given a rea&s;on why the wings of diving
fowls are placed &s;o forward: doubtle&s;s, not
for the purpo&s;e of promoting their &s;peed in
flying, &s;ince that po&s;ition certainly impedes
it; but probably for the increa&s;e of their
motion under water, by the u&s;e of four oars
in&s;tead of two; yet were the wings and feet
nearer together, as in land birds, they would,
when in action, rather hinder than a&s;&s;i&s;t one
another.</P>
<P>This <HI>Colymbus</HI> was of con&s;iderable bulk,
weighing only three drachms &s;hort of three
<PB N="75" REF="72">
pounds avoirdupois. It mea&s;ured in length
from the bill to the tail (which was very
&s;hort) two feet; and to the extremities of
the toes four inches more; and the breadth
of the wings expanded was 42 inches. A
per&s;on attempted to eat the body, but found
it very &s;trong and rancid, as is the fle&s;h of
all birds living on fi&s;h. <HI>Divers</HI> or <HI>Loons,</HI>
though bred in the mo&s;t northerly parts of
Europe, yet are &s;een with us in very &s;evere

of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The legs of the <HI>Colymbi</HI> and <HI>Mergi</HI> are
placed &s;o very backward, and &s;o out of all
center of gravity, that the&s;e birds cannot

de&s;erves; in Italy, of &s;ucking the teats of

lays its eggs along the chines of kine, where
the maggots, when hatched, eat their way
through the hide of the bea&s;t into the fle&s;h,
and grow to a very large &s;ize. I have ju&s;t
talked with a man, who &s;ays, he has more
than once &s;tripped calves who have died of

<P>A <HI>fern owl,</HI> this evening (Augu&s;t 27),
&s;howed off in a very unu&s;ual and entertaining
manner, by hawking round and round the
circumference of my great &s;preading oak,
for twenty times following, keeping mo&s;tly
clo&s;e to the gra&s;s, but occa&s;ionally glanc|ing

up amid&s;t the boughs of the tree. This
amu&s;ing bird was then in pur&s;uit of a brood
of &s;ome particular phalaena belonging to the

exhibited on the occa&s;ion a command of
wing &s;uperior, I think, to that of the &s;wallow
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on approaches the haunt of
fern-owls in an evening, they continue fly|ing
round the head of the obtruder, and by
&s;triking their wings together above their
backs, in the manner that the pigeons called
&s;miters are known to do, make a &s;mart
&s;nap: perhaps at that time they are jealous
for their young; and this noi&s;e and ge&s;ture
are intended by way of menace.</P>
<P>Fern-owls have attachment to oaks, no
doubt on account of food; for the next
evening we &s;aw one again &s;everal times

<HEAD>SAND MARTINS.</HEAD>
<P>MARCH 23, 1788. A gentleman who was
this week on a vi&s;it at Waverley, took the
opportunity of examining &s;ome of the holes
in the &s;and banks with which that di&s;trict
abounds. As the&s;e are undoubtedly bored
by bank-martins, and are the places where
they avowedly breed, he was in hopes they
<PB N="84" REF="81">
might have &s;lept there al&s;o, and that he
might have &s;urpri&s;ed them ju&s;t as they
were awaking from their winter &s;lumbers.
When he had dug for &s;ome time, he found
the holes were horizontal, and &s;erpentine, as
I had ob&s;erved before; and that the ne&s;ts
were depo&s;ited at the inner end, and had
been occupied by broods in former &s;ummers:
but no torpid birds were to be found. He
opened and examined about a dozen holes.
Another gentleman made the &s;ame &s;earch
many years ago, with as little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e holes were in depth about two
feet.</P>
<P>March 21, 1790. A &s;ingle <HI>bank</HI> or <HI>&s;and
martin</HI> was &s;een hovering and playing round
the &s;and pit at Short heath, where in the
&s;ummer they abound.</P>
<P>April 9, 1793. A &s;ober hind a&s;&s;ures us,

<HI>bank-martins</HI> playing in and out, and
hanging before &s;ome ne&s;t holes in a &s;and

<P>This incident confirms my &s;u&s;picions, that
this &s;pecies of hirundo is to be &s;een fir&s;t of
any; and gives great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that
they do not leave their wild haunts at all,
but are &s;ecreted amid&s;t the clefts and caverns
of tho&s;e abrupt cliffs where they u&s;ually &s;pend
their &s;ummers.</P>
<P>The late &s;evere weather con&s;idered, it is
not very probable that the&s;e birds &s;hould
have migrated &s;o early from a tropical re|gion,
through all the&s;e cutting winds, and

go. The flight about the church &s;eems to
con&s;i&s;t chiefly of hou&s;e-martins, about 400
in number: but there are other places of

<P>It is remarkable, that though mo&s;t of them
&s;it on the battlements and roof, yet many

This occurrence brought to my mind the

it might be proper, though not practi&s;ed, to
leave purpo&s;ely &s;ome male plants in every

the blo&s;&s;oms. The female plants without
their male attendants are not in their natural
&s;tate: hence we may &s;uppo&s;e the frequent
failure of crop &s;o incident to hop-grounds; no
other growth, cultivated by man, has &s;uch
frequent and general failures as hops.</P>
<P>Two hop gardens much injured by a hail
