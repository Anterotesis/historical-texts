<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of day Ma|dame
arrived at a &s;mall village &s;i|tuated
among the mountains, where &s;he
purpo&s;ed to pa&s;s the night. The even|ing
was remarkably fine, and the gro|te&s;que
beauty of the &s;urrounding &s;cenery
invited her to walk. She followed the
windings of a &s;tream, which was lo&s;t at
&s;ome di&s;tance among luxuriant groves
of che&s;nut. The rich colouring of even|ing
glowed through the dark foliage,
which &s;preading a pen&s;ive gloom around,
offered a &s;cene congenial to the pre&s;ent
temper of her mind, and &s;he entered the
&s;hades. Her thoughts, affected by the
<PB N="2" REF="4">
&s;urrounding objects, gradually &s;unk into
a plea&s;ing and complacent melancholy,
and &s;he was in&s;en&s;ibly led on. She &s;till
followed the cour&s;e of the &s;tream to where
the deep &s;hades retired, and the &s;cene
again opening to day, yielded to her a
view &s;o various and &s;ublime, that &s;he
pau&s;ed in thrilling and delightful won|der.
A group of wild and grote&s;que
rocks ro&s;e in a &s;emicircular form, and
their fanta&s;tic &s;hapes exhibited Nature in
her mo&s;t &s;ublime and &s;triking attitudes.
Here her va&s;t magnificence elevated the
mind of the beholder with high enthu|&s;ia&s;m.
Fancy caught the thrilling &s;en|&s;ation,
and at her touch the towering
&s;teeps became &s;haded with unreal
glooms; the caves more darkly frowned&mdash;the
projecting cliffs a&s;&s;umed a more
terrific a&s;pect, and the wild overhanging
&s;hrubs waved to the gale in deeper
murmurs. The &s;cene in&s;pired Ma|dame
with reverential awe, and her
thoughts involuntarily ro&s;e "from Na|ture
up to Nature's God." The la&s;t dy|ing
<PB N="3" REF="5">
gleams of day tinted the rocks and
&s;hone upon the waters, which retired
through a rugged channel, and were lo&s;t
afar among the receding cliffs. While &s;he
li&s;tened to their di&s;tant murmur, a voice
of liquid and melodious &s;weetne&s;s aro&s;e
from among the rocks; it &s;ung an air,
who&s;e melancholy expre&s;&s;ion awakened
all her attention, and captivated her heart.
The tones &s;welled and died faintly away
among the clear, yet langui&s;hing, echoes
which the rocks repeated with an effect
like that of enchantment. Madame
looked around in &s;earch of the &s;weet
warbler, and ob&s;erved at &s;ome di&s;tance
a pea&s;ant girl &s;eated on a &s;mall projec|tion
of the rock, over&s;hadowed by droop|ing
&s;ycamores. She moved &s;lowly to|wards
the &s;pot, which &s;he had almo&s;t
reached, when the &s;ound of her &s;teps
&s;tartled and &s;ilenced the &s;yren, who,
on perceiving a &s;tranger, aro&s;e in an
attitude to depart. The voice of Ma|dame
arre&s;ted her, and &s;he approach|ed.
<PB N="4" REF="6">
Language cannot paint the &s;en&s;a|tion
of Madame, when, in the di&s;gui&s;e
of a pea&s;ant girl, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the
features of Julia, who&s;e eyes lighted up
with &s;udden recollection, and who &s;unk
into her arms overcome with joy. When
their fir&s;t emotions were &s;ub&s;ided,
and Julia had received an&s;wers to her enqui|ries
concerning Ferdinand and Emilia,
&s;he led Madame to the place of her con|cealment.
This was a &s;olitary cottage,
in a clo&s;e valley &s;urrounded by moun|tains
who&s;e cliffs appeared wholly inac|ce&s;&s;ible
to mortal foot. The deep &s;oli|tude
of the &s;cene di&s;&s;ipated at once Ma|dame's
wonder that Julia had &s;o long
remained undi&s;covered, and excited &s;ur|prize
how &s;he had been able to explore
a &s;pot thus deeply &s;eque&s;tered; but
Madame ob&s;erved with extreme con|cern,
that the countenance of Julia no
longer wore the &s;mile of health and
gaiety. Her fine features had received
the impre&s;&s;ions not only of melancholy,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
but of grief. Madame &s;ighed as &s;he
gazed, and read too plainly the cau&s;e
of the change. Julia under&s;tood that &s;igh,
and an&s;wered it with her tears. She
pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Madame in mourn|ful
&s;ilence to her lips, and her cheeks
were &s;uffu&s;ed with a crim&s;on glow. At
length, recovering her&s;elf, "I have
much, my dear Madame, to tell," &s;aid
&s;he, "and much to explain, 'ere you
will admit me again to that e&s;teem of
which I was once &s;o ju&s;tly proud. I
had no re&s;ource from mi&s;ery, but
in flight; and of that I could not make
you a confidant, without meanly in|volving
you in its di&s;grace." "Say no
more, my love, on the &s;ubject," replied
Madame; "with re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I ad|mired
your conduct, and felt &s;everely
for your &s;ituation. Rather let me hear
by what means you effected your e&s;|cape,
and what has &s;ince befallen you."
Julia pau&s;ed a moment, as if to &s;ti&s;le her
ri&s;ing emotion, and then commenced her narrative.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
"You are already acquainted with
the &s;ecret of that night, &s;o fatal to my
peace. I recall the remembrance of it
with an angui&s;h which I cannot con|ceal;
and why &s;hould I wi&s;h its con|cealment,
&s;ince I mourn for one, who&s;e noble
qualities ju&s;tified all my admi|ration,
and de&s;erved more than my
feeble prai&s;e can be&s;tow; the idea of
whom will be the la&s;t to linger in
my mind till death &s;huts up this pain|ful
&s;cene." Her voice trembled, and
&s;he pau&s;ed. After a few moments &s;he
re&s;umed her tale. "I will &s;pare my|&s;elf
the pain of recurring to &s;cenes
with which you are not unacquainted,
and proceed to tho&s;e which more imme|diately
attract your intere&s;t. Caterina,
my faithful &s;ervant, you know, attend|ed
me in my confinement; to her kind|ne&s;s
I owe my e&s;cape. She obtained
from her lover, a &s;ervant in the ca&s;tle,
that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which gave me liberty.
One night when Carlo, who had been
appointed my guard, was a&s;leep, Nicolo
<PB N="7" REF="9">
crept into his chamber, and &s;tole from
him the keys of my pri&s;on. He had
previou&s;ly procured a ladder of ropes.
O! I can never forget my emotions,
when in the dead hour of that night,
which was meant to precede the day of
my &s;acrifice, I heard the door of my
pri&s;on unlock, and found my&s;elf half
at liberty! My trembling limbs with
difficulty &s;upported me as I followed
Caterina to the &s;aloon, the windows of
which being low and near to the terrace,
&s;uited our purpo&s;e. To the terrace we
ea&s;ily got, where Nicolo awaited us with
the rope ladder. He fa&s;tened it to the
ground; and having climbed to the top
of the parapet, quickly &s;lided down
on the other &s;ide. There he held it
while we a&s;cended, and de&s;cended; and
I &s;oon breathed the air of freedom again.
But the apprehen&s;ion of being retaken
was &s;till too powerful to permit a full
enjoyment of my e&s;cape. It was my
plan to proceed to the place of my
<PB N="8" REF="10">
faithful Caterina's nativity, where &s;he
had a&s;&s;ured me I might find a &s;afe a&s;y|lum
in the cottage of her parents, from
whom, as they had never &s;een me I
might conceal my birth. This place,
&s;he &s;aid, was entirely unknown to the
marquis, who had hired her at Naples
only a few months before, without any
enquiries concerning her family. She
had informed me that the village was
many leagues di&s;tant from the ca&s;tle,
but that &s;he was very well acquainted
with the road. At the foot of the walls
we left Nicolo, who returned to the ca&s;|tle
to prevent &s;u&s;picion, but with an in|tention
to leave it at a le&s;s dangerous
time, and repair to Farrini to his good
Caterina. I parted from him with many
thanks, and gave him a &s;mall diamond
cro&s;s, which, for that purpo&s;e, I had
taken from the jewels &s;ent to me for
wedding ornaments."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>"ABOUT aquarter of a league from
the walls we &s;topped, and I a&s;&s;um|ed
the habit in which you now &s;ee me.
My own dre&s;s was fa&s;tened to &s;ome hea|vy
&s;tones, and Caterina threw it into the
&s;tream, who&s;e murmurings you have &s;o
often admired. The fatigue and hard|&s;hip
I endured in this journey, perform|ed
almo&s;t wholly on foot, at any other
time would have overcome me; but my
mind was &s;o occupied by the danger I
was avoiding, that the&s;e le&s;&s;er evils were
di&s;regarded. We arrived in &s;afety at
the cottage, which &s;tood at a little di&s;|tance
from the village of Farrini and
were received by Caterina's parents with
&s;ome &s;urprize, and more kindne&s;s. I
&s;oon perceived it would be u&s;ele&s;s, and
even dangerous, to attempt to pre&s;eve
the character I per&s;onated. In the eyes
of Caterina's mother, I read a degree of
<PB N="10" REF="12">
&s;urprize and admiration which declar|ed
&s;he believed me of &s;uperior rank;
I, therefore, thought it more prudent to
win her fidelity by entru&s;ting her with
my &s;ecret than, by endeavouring to con|ceal
it, leave it to be di&s;covered by
her curio&s;ity or di&s;cernment. Accord|ingly
I made known my quality and
my di&s;tre&s;s, and received &s;trong a&s;&s;uran|ces
of a&s;&s;i&s;tance and attachment. For fur|ther
&s;ecurity, I removed to this &s;u&s;pici|ous
&s;pot. The cottage we are now in
belongs to a &s;i&s;ter of Caterina, upon who&s;e
faithfulne&s;s I have been hitherto fully
ju&s;tified in relying. But I am not even
here &s;ecure from apprehen&s;ion, &s;ince for
&s;everal days pa&s;t hor&s;emen of a &s;upici|ous
appearance have been ob&s;erved near
Marcy, which is only half a league from hence."</P>
<P>Here Julia clo&s;ed her narration,to
which Madame had li&s;tened with a mix|ture
of &s;urprize and pity, which her eyes
&s;ufficiently di&s;covered. The la&s;t circum|&s;tance
<PB N="11" REF="13">
of the narrative &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed
her. She acquainted Julia with the pur|&s;uit
which the duke had undertaken;
and &s;he did not he&s;itate to believe it a
party of his people whom Julia had de&s;|cribed.
Madame, therefore, carne&s;tly
advi&s;ed her to quit her pre&s;ent &s;ituation,
and to accompany her in di&s;gui&s;e to the
mona&s;tery of St. Augu&s;tin, where &s;he
would find a &s;ecure retreat; becau&s;e,
even if her place of refuge &s;hould be di&s;|covered,
the &s;uperior authority of the
church would protect her. Julia ac|cepted
the propo&s;al with much joy. As
it was nece&s;&s;ary that Madame &s;hould
&s;leep at the village where &s;he had left
her &s;ervants and hor&s;es, it was agreed
that at break of day &s;he &s;hould return to
the cottage, where Julia would await
her. Madame took an affectionate leave
of Julia, who&s;e heart, in &s;pite of rea&s;on,
&s;unk when &s;he &s;aw her depart though
but for the nece&s;&s;ary interval of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>At the dawn of day Madame aro&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
Her &s;ervants, who were hired for the
journey, were &s;trangers to Julia, from
them, therefore, &s;he had nothing to ap|prehend.
She reached the cottage before
&s;un-ri&s;e, having left her people at &s;ome
little di&s;tance. Her heart foreboded evil,
when, on knocking at the door, no an|&s;wer
was returned. She knocked again,
and &s;till all was &s;ilent. Through the
ca&s;ement &s;he could di&s;cover no object,
amid&s;t the grey ob&s;curity of the dawn.
She now opened the door, and to her
inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;tre&s;s,
found the cottage empty. She pro|ceeded
to a &s;mall inner room, where lay
a part of Julia's apparel. The bed had no
appearance of having been &s;lept in, and
every moment &s;erved to heighten and
confirm her apprehen&s;ions. While &s;he
pur&s;ued the &s;earch, &s;he &s;uddenly heard
the trampling of feet at the cottage door,
and pre&s;ently after &s;ome people entered.
Her fears for Julia now yielded to tho&s;e
for her own &s;afety, and &s;he was undeter|mined
<PB N="13" REF="15">
whether to di&s;cover her&s;elf, or
remain in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, when
&s;he was relieved from her irre&s;olution
and di&s;tre&s;s by the appearance of Julia.</P>
<P>On the return of the good woman,
who had accompanied Madame to the
village on the preceding night, Julia went
to the cottage at Farrini. Her grate|ful
heart would not &s;uffer her to depart
without taking leave of her faithful
friends, thanking them for their kind|ne&s;s,
and informing them of her future
pro&s;pects. They had prevailed upon
her to &s;pend the few intervening hours
at this cot, whence &s;he had ju&s;t ri&s;en
to meet Madame.</P>
<P>They now ha&s;tened to the &s;pot where
the hor&s;es were &s;tationed,and commenc|ed
their journey. For &s;ome leagues they
travelled in &s;ilence and thought, over
a wild and picture&s;que country. The
land&s;cape was tinted with rich and varie|gated
hues; and the autumnal lights,
which &s;treamed upon the hills, produc|ed
<PB N="14" REF="16">
a &s;pirited and beautiful effect upon the
&s;cenery. All the glories of the vin|tage
ro&s;e to their view: the purple
grapes flu&s;hed through the dark green of
the &s;urrounding foliage, and the pro&s;|pect
glowed with warm luxuriance.</P>
<P>They now de&s;cended into a deep val|ley,
which appeared more like a &s;cene
of airy enchantment than reality. Along
the bottom flowed a clear maje&s;tic
&s;tream, who&s;e banks were adorned with
thick groves of orange and citron trees.
Julia &s;urveyed the &s;cene in &s;ilent com|placency,
but her eye quickly caught
an object which changed with in&s;tanta|neous
&s;hock the tone of her feelings.
She ob&s;erved a party of hor&s;emen wind|ing
down the &s;ide of a hill behind them.
Their uncommon &s;peed alarmed her,
and she pushed her hor&s;e into a gallop.
On looking back they clearly perceived
them&s;elves to be pur&s;ued. Soon after
the men &s;uddenly appeared from behind
a dark grove within a &s;mall di&s;tance of
<PB N="15" REF="17">
them; and upon their nearer approach,
Julia overcome with fatigue and fear,
&s;unk breathle&s;s from her hor&s;e. She was
&s;aved from the ground by one of the
pur&s;uers, who caught her in his arms.
Madame, with the re&s;t of the party, were
quickly overtaken; and as &s;oon as Julia
revived, they were bound, and re-con|ducted
to the hill from whence they had
de&s;cended. Imagination only can paint
the angui&s;h of Julia's mind, when &s;he &s;aw
her&s;elf thus delivered up to the power of
her enemy. Madame, in the &s;urround|ing
troop, di&s;covered none of the mar|quis's
people, and they were therefore
evidently in the hands of the duke.
After travelling for &s;ome hours, they
quitted the main road, and turned into
a narrow winding dell, over&s;hadowed
by high trees, which almo&s;t excluded
the light. The gloom of the place in|&s;pired
terrific images. Julia trembled
as &s;he entered; and her emotion was
heightened, when &s;he perceived at &s;ome
<PB N="16" REF="18">
di&s;tance, through the long per&s;pective
of the trees, a large ruinous man&s;ion.
The gloom of the &s;urrounding &s;hades
partly concealed it from her view; but,
as &s;he drew near, each forlorn and de|caying
feature of the fabric was gradually
di&s;clo&s;ed, and &s;truck upon her heart a
horror &s;uch as &s;he had never before ex|perienced.
The broken battlements,
enwreathed with ivy, proclaimed the
fallen grandeur of the place, while the
&s;hattered vacant window frames exhibit|ed
its de&s;olation, and the high gra&s;s that
overgrew the thre&s;hold, &s;eemed to &s;ay
how long it was &s;ince mortal foot had
entered. The place appeared fit only for
the purpo&s;es of violence and de&s;truction:
and the unfortunate captives, when they
&s;topped at its gates, felt the full force
of its horrors.</P>
<P>They were taken from their hor&s;es,
and conveyed to an interior part of the
building, which, if it had once been a
chamber, no longer de&s;erved the name.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
Here the guard &s;aid they were directed
to detain them till the arrival of their
lord, who had appointed this the place of
rendezvous. He was expected to meet
them in a few hours, and the&s;e were
hours of inde&s;cribable torture to Julia
and Madame. From the furious pa&s;|&s;ions
of the duke, exa&s;perated by fre|quent
di&s;appointment, Julia had every
evil to apprehend; and the loneline&s;s of
the &s;pot he had cho&s;en, enabled him to
perpetrate any de&s;igns, however violent.
For the fir&s;t time, &s;he repented that &s;he
had left her father's hou&s;e. Madame
wept over her, but comfort &s;he had none
to give. The day clo&s;ed&mdash;the duke did
not appear, and the fate of Julia yet
hung in perilous uncertainty. At length,
from a window of the apartment &s;he
was in, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed a glimmering
of torches among the trees, and pre|&s;ently
after the clattering of hoofs con|vinced
her the duke was approaching.
Her heart &s;unk at the &s;ound; and throw|ing
<PB N="18" REF="20">
her arms round Madame's neck, &s;he
re&s;igned her&s;elf to de&s;pair. She was
&s;oon rou&s;ed by &s;ome men, who came to
announce the arrival of their lord. In
a few moments the place, which had
lately been &s;o &s;ilent, echoed with tumult;
and a &s;udden blaze of light illum|ining
the fabric, &s;erved to exhibit more
forcibly its &s;triking horrors. Julia ran to
the window; and in a &s;ort of court below,
perceived a group of men di&s;mount|ing
from their hor&s;es. The torches
&s;hed a partial light; and while &s;he
anxiou&s;ly looked around for the per&s;on
of the duke, the whole party entered the
man&s;ion. She li&s;tened to a confu&s;ed up|roar
of voices, which &s;ounded from the
room beneath, and &s;oon after it &s;unk
into a low murmur, as if &s;ome matter of
importance was in agitation. For &s;ome
moments &s;he &s;at in lingering terror,
when &s;he heard foot&s;teps advancing to|wards
the chamber, and a &s;udden gleam
of torch-light fla&s;hed upon the walls.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">
"Wretched girl! I have at la&s;t &s;ecured
you!" &s;aid a cavalier, who now entered
the room. He &s;topped as he perceived
Julia; and turning to the men who
&s;tood without, "Are the&s;e," &s;aid he,
"the fugitives you have taken?" "Yes,
my lord."&mdash;"Then you have deceived
your&s;elves, and mi&s;led me; this is not
my daughter." The&s;e words &s;truck the
&s;udden light of truth and joy upon the
heart of Julia, whom terror had before
rendered almo&s;t lifele&s;s; and who had
not perceived that the per&s;on entering
was a &s;tranger. Madame now &s;tepped for ward,
and an explanation en&s;ued, when
it appeared that the &s;tranger was the
marquis Murani, the father of the fair
fugitive whom the duke had before
mi&s;taken for Julia.</P>
<P>The appearance and the evident flight
of Julia, had deceived the banditti em|ployed
by this nobleman, into a belief
that &s;he was the object of their &s;earch,
and had occa&s;ioned her this unnece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="20" REF="22">
di&s;tre&s;s. But the joy &s;he now felt
on finding her&s;elf thus unexpectedly at
liberty, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, her pre|ceding
terrors. The marquis made Ma|dame
and Julia all the reparation in
his power, by offering immediately to
reconduct them to the main road, and
to guard them to &s;ome place of &s;afety
for the night. This offer was eagerly
and thankfully accepted; and though
faint from di&s;tre&s;s, fatigue, and want of
&s;u&s;tenance, they joyfully remounted
their hor&s;es, and by torch-light quitted
the man&s;ion. After &s;ome hours travel|ling
they arrived at a &s;mall town, where
they procured the accommodation &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;upport and repo&s;e.
Here their guides quitted them to con|tinue
their &s;earch.</P>
<P>They aro&s;e with the dawn, and con|tinued
their journey, continually terri|fied
with the apprehen&s;ion of encounter|ing
the duke's people. At noon they
arrived at Azulia, from whence the
<PB N="21" REF="23">
mona&s;tery; or abbey of St. Augu&s;tin
was di&s;tant only a few miles. Madame
wrote to the <HI>Padre Abate,</HI> to whom &s;he
was &s;omewhat related, and &s;oon after
received an an&s;wer very favourable to
her wi&s;hes. The &s;ame evening they re|paired
to the abbey, where Julia, once
more relieved from the fear of pur&s;uit,
offered up a prayer of gratitude to Hea|ven,
and endeavoured, to calm her &s;or|rows
by devotion. She was received by
the abbot with a &s;ort of paternal affec|tion,
and by the nuns with officious
kindne&s;s. Comforted by the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
and by the tranquil appearance
of every thing around her, &s;he retired to
re&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in peaceful
&s;lumbers</P>
<P>In her pre&s;ent &s;ituation &s;he found
much novelty to amu&s;e, and much &s;e|rious
matter to engage her mind. En|tendered
by di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he ea&s;ily yielded to
the pen&s;ive manners of her companions,
and to the &s;erene uniformity of a mona&s;|tic
<PB N="22" REF="24">
life. She loved to wander through
the lonely cloi&s;ters, and high-arched
ai&s;les, who&s;e long per&s;pectives retired
in &s;imple grandeur, diffu&s;ing a holy
calm around. She found much plea|&s;ure
in the conver&s;ation of the nuns,
many of whom were uncommonly ami|able,
and the dignified &s;weetne&s;s of
who&s;e manners formed a charm irre|&s;i&s;tibly
attractive. The &s;oft melancholy
impre&s;&s;ed upon their countenances, pour|trayed
the &s;ituation of their minds, and
excited in Julia a very intere&s;ting mix|ture
of pity and e&s;teem. The affection|ate
appellation of &s;i&s;ter, and all that en|dearing
tenderne&s;s which they &s;o well
know how to di&s;play, and of which they
&s;o well under&s;tand the effect, they be|&s;towed
on Julia, in the hope of winning
her to become one of their order.</P>
<P>Soothed by the pre&s;ence of Madame,
the a&s;&s;iduity of the nuns, and by the
&s;tillne&s;s and &s;anctity of the place, her
mind gradually recovered a degree of
complacency to which it had long been
<PB N="23" REF="25">
a &s;tranger. But notwith&s;tanding all her
efforts, the idea of Hippolitus would at
intervals return upon her memory with a
force that at once &s;ubdued her fortitude,
and &s;unk her in a temporary de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Among the holy &s;i&s;ters, Julia di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
one, the &s;ingular fervor of who&s;e
devotion, and the pen&s;ive air of who&s;e
countenance, &s;oftened by the languor of
illne&s;s, attracted her curio&s;ity, and ex|cited
a &s;trong degree of pity. The nun,
by a &s;ort of &s;ympathy, &s;eemed particu|larly
inclined towards Julia, which &s;he
di&s;covered by innumerable acts of kind|ne&s;s,
&s;uch as the heart can quickly un|der&s;tand
and acknowledge, although
de&s;cription can never reach them. In
conver&s;ation with her, Julia endeavour|ed,
as far as delicacy would permit,
to prompt an explanation of that more
than common dejection which &s;haded
tho&s;e features, where beauty, touched
by refignation and &s;ublimed by religi|on,
&s;hone forth with mild and lambent lu&s;tre.</P>

The duke de Luovo, after having
been detained for &s;ome weeks by the
fever which his wounds had produced,
and his irritated pa&s;&s;ions had much pro|longed,
arrived at the ca&s;tle of Mazzini.
When the marquis &s;aw him return, and
recollected the futility of tho&s;e exerti|ons,
by which he had boa&s;tingly pro|mi&s;ed
to recover Julia, the violence of
his nature &s;purned the di&s;gui&s;e of art,

with equal fury. The con&s;equence

ambition of the marquis &s;ubdued the
&s;udden irritation of his inferior pa&s;|&s;ions,
and induced him to &s;often the &s;everity
of his accu&s;ations, by &s;ub|&s;equent
conce&s;&s;ions. The duke, who&s;e
pa&s;&s;ion for Julia was heightened by the

&s;uch conce&s;&s;ions as in other circum|&s;tances
he would have rejected; and
thus each, conquered by the predomi|nant

pa&s;&s;ion of the moment, &s;ubmitted
to be the &s;lave of his adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>Emilia was at length relea&s;ed from
the confinement &s;he had &s;o unju&s;tly &s;uf|fered.
She had now the u&s;e of her old
apartments, where, &s;olitary and dejected,
her hours moved heavily along, embit|tered
by ince&s;&s;ant anxiety for Julia,
and by regret for the lo&s;t &s;ociety of
Madame. The marchione&s;s, who&s;e plea|&s;ures
&s;uffered a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;e du|ring
the pre&s;ent confu&s;ion at the ca&s;tle,
exerci&s;ed the ill-humoured caprice,
which di&s;appointment and la&s;&s;itude in|&s;pired,
upon her remaining &s;ubject.
Emilia was condemned to &s;uffer, and
to endure without the privilege of com|plaining.
In reviewing the events of the
la&s;t few weeks, &s;he &s;aw tho&s;e mo&s;t

The &s;earch after Julia &s;till continued,
and was &s;till un&s;ucce&s;sful. The a&s;to|ni&s;hment

Julia, ignorant of the country, and de&s;|titute

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN WHILE Julia, &s;heltered in
the ob&s;cure rece&s;&s;es of St. Au|gu&s;tin,
endeavoured to attain a degree of
that tranquillity which &s;o &s;trikingly cha|racterized
the &s;cenes around her. The
abbey of St. Augu&s;tin was a large mag|nificent
ma&s;s of Gothic architecture,
who&s;e gloomy battlements, and maje&s;|tic
towers, aro&s;e in proud &s;ublimity
from amid the darkne&s;s of the &s;urround|ing
&s;hades. It was founded in the
twelfth century, and &s;tood a proud
monument of monki&s;h &s;uper&s;tition and
princely munificence. In the times
when Italy was agitated by internal com|motions,
and per&s;ecuted by foreign in|vaders,
this edifice afforded an a&s;ylum
to many noble Italian emigrants, who
here con&s;ecrated the re&s;t of their days
to religion. At their death they en|riched
the mona&s;tery with the trea&s;ures
which it had enabled them to &s;ecure.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">
The view of this building revived in
the mind of the beholder the memory
of pa&s;t ages. The manners and charac|ters
which di&s;tingui&s;hed them aro&s;e to
his fancy, and through the long lap&s;e of
years, he di&s;criminated tho&s;e cu&s;toms
and manners which formed &s;o &s;triking
a contra&s;t to the modes of his own times.
The rude manners, the boi&s;terous pa&s;|&s;ions,
the daring ambition, and the gro&s;s
indulgences which formerly characteri|zed
the prie&s;t, the nobleman, and the
&s;overeign, had then begun to yield to
learning&mdash;the charms of refined conver|&s;ation&mdash;political
intrigue and private ar|tifices.
Thus do the &s;cenes of life vary
with the predominant pa&s;&s;ions of man|kind,
and with the progre&s;s of civiliza|tion.
The dark clouds of prejudice
break away before the &s;un of &s;cience,
and gradually di&s;&s;olving, leave the
brightening hemi&s;phere to the influence
of his beams. But through the pre|&s;ent
&s;cene appeared only a few &s;cattered
<PB N="29" REF="31">
rays, which &s;erved to &s;hew more forci|bly
the va&s;t and heavy ma&s;&s;es that con|cealed
the form of truth. Here preju|dice,
not rea&s;on, &s;u&s;pended the influence
of the pa&s;&s;ions; and &s;chola&s;tic learning,
my&s;terious philo&s;ophy, and crafty &s;anc|tity,
&s;upplied the place of wi&s;dom, &s;im|plicity,
and pure devotion.</P>
<P>At the abbey, &s;olitude and &s;tillne&s;s,
con&s;pired with the &s;olemn a&s;pect of the
pile to impre&s;s the mind with religious
awe. The dim gla&s;s of the high-arched
windows, &s;tained with the colouring of
monki&s;h fictions, and &s;haded by the
thick trees that environed the abbey,
&s;pread around a &s;acred gloom, which
in&s;pired the beholder with congenial feelings.</P>
<P>As Julia mu&s;ed through the walks,
and &s;urveyed this va&s;t monument of
barbarous &s;uper&s;tition, it brought to her
recollection an ode which &s;he often re|peated
with melancholy plea&s;ure, as the

<P>She wept to the memory of times
pa&s;t, and there was a romantic &s;adne&s;s
in her feelings, luxurious and indefina|ble.
Madame behaved to Julia with
the tendere&s;t attention, and endeavoured
to withdraw her thoughts from their
mournful &s;ubject, by promoting that
ta&s;te for literature and mu&s;ic, which was
&s;o &s;uitable to the powers of her mind.</P>
<P>But an object &s;eriou&s;ly intere&s;ting
now obtained that regard, which tho&s;e
of mere amu&s;ement failed to attract.
Her favourite nun, for whom her love
and e&s;teem daily encrea&s;ed, &s;eemed de|clining
under the pre&s;&s;ure of a &s;ecret
grief. Julia was deeply affected with
her &s;ituation, and though &s;he was not
empowered to admini&s;ter con&s;olation to
her &s;orrows, &s;he endeavoured to miti|gate
the &s;ufferings of illne&s;s. She nur&s;|ed
<PB N="32" REF="34">
her with unremitting care, and &s;eem|ed
to &s;eize with avidity the temporary
opportunity of e&s;caping from her&s;elf.
The nun appeared perfectly reconciled
to her fate, and exhibited during her ill|ne&s;s,
&s;o much &s;weetne&s;s, patience, and
re&s;ignation, as affected all around her
with pity and love. Her angelic mild|ne&s;s,
and &s;teady fortitude, characterized
the beatification of a &s;aint, rather than
the death of a mortal. Julia watched
every turn of her di&s;order with the ut|mo&s;t
&s;olicitude, and her care was at
length rewarded by the amendment of
Cornelia. Her health gradually im|proved,
and &s;he attributed this cir|cum&s;tance
to the a&s;&s;iduity and tenderne&s;s
of her young friend, to whom her heart
now expanded in warm and unre&s;erved
affection. At length Julia ventured to
&s;olicit what &s;he had &s;o long and &s;o ear|ne&s;tly
wi&s;hed for, and Cornelia unfolded
the hi&s;tory of her &s;orrows.</P>
<P>"Of the life which your care has
<PB N="33" REF="35">
prolonged," &s;aid &s;he, "it is but ju&s;t
that you &s;hould know the events;
though tho&s;e events are neither new,
or &s;triking, and po&s;&s;e&s;s little power
of intere&s;ting per&s;ons unconnected with
them. To me they have, however,
been unexpectedly dreadful in effect,
and my heart a&s;&s;ures me, that to you
they will not be indifferent."</P>
<P>"I am the unfortunate de&s;cendant of
an ancient and illu&s;trious Italian family.
In early childhood I was deprived of a
mother's care, but the tenderne&s;s of my
&s;urviving parent made her lo&s;s, as to my
welfare, almo&s;t unfelt. Suffer me here
to do ju&s;tice to the character of my no|ble
father. He united in an eminent
degree, the mild virtues of &s;ocial life,
with the firm unbending qualities of the
noble Romans, his ance&s;ters, from whom
he was proud to trace his de&s;cent. Their
merit, indeed, continually dwelt on his
tongue, and their actions he was always
endeavouring to imitate, as far as was
<PB N="34" REF="36">
con&s;i&s;tent with the character of his times,
and with the limited &s;phere in which he
moved. The recollection of his virtue
elevates my mind, and fills my heart
with a noble pride, which even the cold
walls of a mona&s;tery have not been able
to &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>My father's fortune was un&s;uitable to
his rank. That his &s;on might hereafter
be enabled to &s;upport the dignity of his
family, it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to a&s;&s;ume
the veil. Alas! that heart was unfit to
be offered at an heavenly &s;hrine, which
was already devoted to an earthly object.
My affections had long been engaged
by the the younger &s;on of a neighbour|ing
nobleman, who&s;e character and ac|compli&s;hments
attracted my early love,
and confirmed my late&s;t e&s;teem. Our
families were intimate, and our youth|ful
intercour&s;e occa&s;ioned an attach|ment,
which &s;trengthened and expanded
with our years. He &s;olicited me of my
father, but there appeared an in&s;uperable
<PB N="35" REF="37">
barrier to our union. The family of
my lover laboured under circum&s;tances
of &s;imilar di&s;tre&s;s with that of my own&mdash;it
was noble&mdash;but poor! My father,
who was ignorant of the &s;trength of my
affection, and who con&s;idered a mar|riage
formed in poverty as de&s;tructive
to happine&s;s, prohibited his &s;uit.</P>
<P>Touched with chagrin and di&s;ap|pointment,
he immediately entered into
the &s;ervice of his Neapolitian maje&s;ty,
and &s;ought in the tumultuous &s;cenes of
glory, a refuge from the pangs of di&s;ap|pointed
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To me, who&s;e hours moved in one
round of dull uniformity&mdash;who had no
pur&s;uit to intere&s;t&mdash;no variety to ani|mate
my drooping &s;pirits&mdash;to me the
effort of forgetfulne&s;s was ineffectual.
The loved idea of Angelo &s;till ro&s;e
upon my fancy, and its powers of cap|tivation,
heightened by ab&s;ence, and,
perhaps, even by de&s;pair, pur&s;ued me
with ince&s;&s;ant grief. I concealed in

&s;ilence the angui&s;h that preyed upon
my heart, and re&s;igned my&s;elf a willing
victim to mona&s;tic au&s;terity. But I was
now threatened with a new evil, terrible
and unexpected. I was &s;o unfortunate
as to attract the admiration of the mar|quis
Marinelli, and he applied to my
father. He was illu&s;trious at once in
birth and fortune, and his vi&s;its could
only be unwelcome to me. Dreadful
was the moment in which my father
di&s;clo&s;ed to me the propo&s;al. My di&s;|tre&s;s,
which I vainly endeavoured to
command, di&s;covered the exact &s;ituation
of my heart, and my father was af|fected.</P>
<P>After a long and awful pau&s;e, he ge|nerou&s;ly
relea&s;ed me from my di&s;tre&s;s,
by leaving it to my choice to accept the
marquis, or to a&s;&s;ume the veil. I fell
at his feet, overcome by the noble di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s
of his conduct, and in&s;tantly accepted the latter.</P>
<P>This affair removed entirely the di&s;|gui&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="41">
with which I had hitherto guarded
my heart;&mdash;my brother&mdash;my generous
brother! learned the true &s;tate of its af|fections.
He &s;aw the grief which prey|ed
upon my health; he ob&s;erved it to
my father, and he nobly&mdash;oh how no|bly!
to re&s;tore my happine&s;s, de&s;ired to
re&s;ign a part of the e&s;tate which had al|ready
de&s;cended to him in right of his
mother. "Alas! Hippolitus," conti|nued
Cornelia, deeply &s;ighing, "thy
virtues de&s;erved a better fate."</P>
<P>"Hippolitus!" &s;aid Julia, in a tre|mulous
accent, "Hippolitus, count de
Vereza!" "The &s;ame," replied the
nun, in a tone of &s;urprize. Julia was
&s;peechle&s;s; tears, however, came to her
relief. The a&s;toni&s;hment of Cornelia
for &s;ome moment &s;urpa&s;&s;ed expre&s;&s;ion;
at length a gleam of recollection cro&s;&s;ed
her mind, and &s;he too well under&s;tood
the &s;cene before her. Julia, after &s;ome
time revived, when Cornelia tenderly
approaching her, "Do I then embrace
<PB N="38" REF="42">
my &s;i&s;ter!" &s;aid &s;he, "United in &s;enti|ment,
are we al&s;o united in misfortune?"
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> with her &s;ighs, and their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">hewed in mournful &s;ympathy to|gether.
At length Cornelia re&s;umed her narrative.</P>
<P>"My father, &s;truck with the conduct
of Hippolitus, pau&s;ed upon the offer.
The alteration in my health was too ob|vious
to e&s;cape his notice; the conflict
between pride and parental tenderne&s;s,
held him for &s;ome time in indeci&s;ion,
but the latter finally &s;ubdued every op|po&s;ing
feeling, and he yielded his con|&s;ent
to my marriage with Angelo. The
&s;udden tran&s;ition from grief to joy, was
almo&s;t too much for my feeble frame;
judge then what mu&s;t have been the ef|fect
of the dreadful rever&s;e, when the
news arrived that Angelo had fallen in
a foreign engagement! Let me oblite|rate,
if po&s;&s;ible, the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;a|tions
&s;o dreadful. The &s;ufferings of
my brother, who&s;e generous heart could
<PB N="39" REF="43">
&s;o finely feel for another's woe, were on
this occa&s;ion inferior only to my own.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t exce&s;s of my grief was
&s;ub&s;ided, I de&s;ired to retire from a world
which had tempted me only with illu|&s;ive
vi&s;ions of happine&s;s, and to remove
from tho&s;e &s;cenes which prompted re|collection,
and perpetuated my di&s;tre&s;s.
My father applauded my re&s;olution, and
I immediately was admitted a noviciate
into this mona&s;tery, with the Superior of
which my father had in his youth been acquainted.</P>
<P>At the expiration of the year I receiv|ed
the veil. Oh! I well remember
with what perfect re&s;ignation, with what
comfortable complacency I took tho&s;e
vows which bound me to a life of retire|ment,
and religious re&s;t.</P>
<P>The high importance of the moment,
the &s;olemnity of the ceremony, the &s;a|cred
glooms which &s;urrounded me, and
the chilling &s;ilence that prevailed when
I uttered the irrevocable vow&mdash;all con|&s;pired
<PB N="40" REF="44">
to impre&s;s my imagination, and
to rai&s;e my views to heaven. When I
knelt at the altar, the &s;acred flame of
pure devotion glowed in my heart, and
elevated my &s;oul to &s;ublimity. The
world and all its recollections faded
from my mind, and left it to the influ|ence
of a &s;erene and holy enthu&s;ia&s;m
which no words can de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Soon after my noviciation, I had the
misfortune to lo&s;e my dear father. In
the tranquillity of this mona&s;tery, how|ever,
in the &s;oothing kindne&s;s of my
companions, and in devotional exerci&s;es,
my &s;orrows found relief, and the &s;ting
of grief was blunted. My repo&s;e was of
&s;hort continuance. A circum&s;tance oc|curred
that renewed the mi&s;ery, which
can now never quit me but in the grave,
to which I look with no fearful appre|hen&s;ion,
but as a refuge from calamity,
tru&s;ting that the power who has &s;een
good to afflict me, will pardon the im|perfectne&s;s
of my devotion, and the too
<PB N="41" REF="45">
frequent wandering of my thoughts to
the objects once &s;o dear to me."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes,
which beamed with truth and meek a&s;|&s;urance,
to heaven; and the fine devo|tional
&s;uffu&s;ion of her countenance &s;eem|ed
to characterize the beauty of an in|&s;pired &s;aint.</P>
<P>"One day, Oh! never &s;hall I forget
it, I went as u&s;ual to the confe&s;&s;ional
to acknowledge my &s;ins. I knelt before
the father with eyes bent towards the
earth, and in a low voice proceeded to
confe&s;s. I had but one crime to deplore,
and that was the too tender remem|brance
of him for whom I mourned,
and who&s;e idea impre&s;&s;ed upon my
heart, made it a blemi&s;hed offering to
God.</P>
<P>I was interrupted in my confe&s;&s;ion
by a &s;ound of deep &s;obs, and rai&s;ing my
eyes, Oh God, what were my &s;en&s;ations,
when in the features of the holy father,
I di&s;covered Angelo! His image fa|ded
<PB N="42" REF="46">
like a vi&s;ion from my fight, and I
funk at his feet. On recovering I found
my&s;elf on my matra&s;s attended by a
&s;i&s;ter, who I di&s;covered by her conver|&s;ation
had no &s;u&s;picion of the occa&s;ion
of my di&s;order. Indi&s;po&s;ition confined
me to my bed for &s;everal days; when I
recovered, I &s;aw Angelo no more, and
could almo&s;t have doubted my &s;en&s;es,
and believed that an illu&s;ion had cro&s;&s;ed
my &s;ight, till one day I found in my cell
a written paper. I di&s;tingui&s;hed at the
fir&s;t glance the hand writing of Angelo,
that well known hand which had &s;o
often awakened me to other emoti|ons.
I trembled at the &s;ight; my beat|ing
heart acknowledged the beloved
characters; a cold tremor &s;hook my
frame, and half breathle&s;s I &s;eized the
paper. But recollecting my&s;elf, I pau&s;|ed&mdash;I
he&s;itated: duty at length yielded
to the &s;trong temptation, and I read the
lines. Oh! tho&s;e lines! prompted by
de&s;pair, and bathed in my tears! every
<PB N="43" REF="47">
word they offered gave a new pang to
my heart, and &s;welled its angui&s;h almo&s;t
beyond endurance. I learned that An|gelo,
&s;everely wounded in a foreign en|gagement,
had been left for dead
upon the field; that his life
was &s;aved by the humanity of a common &s;oldier
of the enemy, who perceiving &s;igns
of exi&s;tence, conveyed him to a
hou&s;e. A&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;oon procured,
but his wounds exhibited the mo&s;t
alarming &s;ymptoms. During &s;everal
months he langui&s;hed between life and
death, till at length his youth and con|&s;titution
&s;urmounted the conflict, and
he returned to Naples. Here he &s;aw
my brother, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;s and a&s;to|ni&s;hment
at beholding him occa&s;ioned
a relation of pa&s;t circum&s;tances, and of
the vows I had taken in con&s;equence of
the report of his death. It is unne|ce&s;&s;ry
to mention the immediate effect
of this narration; the final one exhibited
a very &s;ingular proof his attachment
<PB N="44" REF="48">
and de&s;pair;&mdash;he devoted him&s;elf to a
mona&s;tic life, and cho&s;e this abbey for
the place of his re&s;idence, becau&s;e it
contained the object mo&s;t dear to his
affections. His letter informed me that
he had purpo&s;ely avoided di&s;covering
him&s;elf, endeavouring to be contented
with the opportunities which occurred of
&s;ilently ob&s;erving me, till chance had
occa&s;ioned the foregoing interview.&mdash;But
that &s;ince its effects had been &s;o
mutually painful, he would relieve me
from the apprehen&s;ion of a &s;imilar di&s;|tre&s;s,
by a&s;&s;uring me, that I &s;hould &s;ee
him no more. He was faithful to his
promi&s;e; from that day I have never
&s;een him, and am even ignorant whe|ther
he yet inhabits this a&s;ylum; the ef|forts
of religious fortitude, and the ju&s;t
fear of exciting &s;urprize, having with|held
me from enquiry. But the moment
of our la&s;t interview has been equally
fatal to my peace and to my health, and
<PB N="45" REF="49">
I tru&s;t I &s;hall ere very long be relea&s;ed
from the agonizing ineffectual &s;truggles
occa&s;ioned by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;acred
vows imperfectly performed, and by
earthly affections not wholly &s;ubdued."</P>
<P>Cornelia cea&s;ed, and Julia, who had
li&s;tened to the narrative in deep atten|tion,
at once admired, loved, and pitied
her. As the &s;i&s;ter of Hippolitus, her
heart expanded towards her, and it was
now inviolably attached by the fine ties
of &s;ympathetic &s;orrow. Similarity of
&s;entiment and &s;uffering united them in
the firme&s;t bonds of friend&s;hip; and thus,
from reciprocation of thought and feel|ing,
flowed a pure and &s;weet con&s;ola|tion.</P>
<P>Julia loved to indulge in the mourn|ful
plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing of Hippolitus,
and when thus engaged, the hours crept
unheeded by. A thou&s;and que&s;tions
&s;he repeated concerning him, but to
tho&s;e mo&s;t intere&s;ting to her, &s;he receive|ed
<PB N="46" REF="50">
no con&s;olatory an&s;wer. Cornelia, who
had heard of the fatal tran&s;action at the
ca&s;tle of Mazzini, deplored with her its
too certain con&s;equence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>JULIA accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to walk in
the fine evenings under the &s;hade of
the high trees that environed the abbey.
The dewy coolne&s;s of the air refre&s;hed
her. The innumerable ro&s;eate tints
which the parting &s;un-beams reflected
on the rocks above, and the fine vermil
glow diffu&s;ed over the romantic &s;cene
beneath, &s;oftly fading from the eye, as
the night-&s;hades fell, excited &s;en&s;ations
of a &s;weet and tranquil nature, and
&s;oothed her into a temporary forgetful|ne&s;s
of her &s;orrows.</P>
<P>The deep &s;olitude of the place &s;ub|dued
her apprehen&s;ion, and one evening
&s;he ventured with Madame de Menon
to lengthen her walk. They returned
to the abbey without having &s;een a hu|man
being, except a friar of the mona&s;|tery,
who had been to a neighbouring
town to order provi&s;ion. On the fol|lowing
<PB N="48" REF="52">
evening they repeated their
walk; and engaged in conver&s;ation,
rambled to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from
the abbey. The di&s;tant bell of the mo|na&s;tery
&s;ounding for ve&s;pers, reminded
them of the hour, and looking round,
they perceived the extremity of the
wood. They were returning towards
the abbey, when &s;truck by the appear|ance
of &s;ome maje&s;tic columns which
were di&s;tingui&s;hable between the trees,
they pau&s;ed. Curio&s;ity tempted them
to examine to what edifice pillars of
&s;uch magnificent architecture could be|long,
in a &s;cene &s;o rude, and they went
on.</P>
<P>There appeared on a point of rock
impending over the valley, the reliques
of a palace, who&s;e beauty time had im|paired
only to heighten its &s;ublimity.
An arch of &s;ingular magnificence re|mained
almo&s;t entire, beyond which
appeared wild cliffs retiring in grand
per&s;pective. The fun, which was now
<PB N="49" REF="53">
&s;etting, threw a trembling lu&s;tre upon
the ruins, and gave a fini&s;hing effect to
the &s;cene. They gazed in mute wonder
upon the view; but the fa&s;t fading light,
and the dewy chillne&s;s of the air warn|ed
them to return. As Julia gave a la&s;t
look to the &s;cene, &s;he perceived two
men leaning upon a part of the ruin at
&s;ome di&s;tance, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation.
As they &s;poke, their looks were &s;o at|tentively
bent on her, that &s;he could
have no doubt &s;he was the &s;ubject of their
di&s;cour&s;e. Alarmed at this circum&s;tance,
Madame and Julia immediately retreat|ed
towards the abbey. They walked
&s;wiftly through the woods, who&s;e &s;hades,
deepened by the gloom of evening,
prevented their di&s;tingui&s;hing whether
they were pur&s;ued. They were &s;urpriz|ed
to ob&s;erve the di&s;tance to which they
had &s;trayed from the mona&s;tery, who&s;e
dark towers were now ob&s;curely &s;een
ri&s;ing among the trees that clo&s;ed the
per&s;pective. They had almo&s;t reached
<PB N="50" REF="54">
the gates, when on looking back, they
perceived the &s;ame men &s;lowly advanc|ing,
without any appearance of pur&s;uit,
but clearly as if ob&s;erving the place of
their retreat.</P>
<P>This incident occa&s;ioned Julia much
alarm. She could not but believe that
the men whom &s;he had &s;een were &s;pies
of the marquis;&mdash;if &s;o, her a&s;ylum was
di&s;covered, and &s;he had every thing to
apprehend. Madame now judged it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to the &s;afety of Julia, that the
Abate &s;hould be informed of her &s;tory,
and of the &s;anctuary &s;he had &s;ought in
his mona&s;tery, and al&s;o that he &s;hould
be &s;olicited to protect her from parent|al
tyranny. This was a hazardous,
but a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep to provide again&s;t
the certain danger which mu&s;t en&s;ue,
&s;hould the marquis, if he demanded
his daughter of the Abate, be the fir&s;t
to acquaint him with her &s;tory. If &s;he
acted otherwi&s;e, &s;he feared that the Abate,
in who&s;e genero&s;ity &s;he had not confi|ded,
<PB N="51" REF="55">
and who&s;e pity &s;he had not &s;olicit|ed,
would, in the pride of his re&s;ent|ment,
deliver her up, and thus would
&s;he become a certain victim to the duke
de Luovo.</P>
<P>Julia approved of this communica|tion,
though &s;he trembled for the event;
and reque&s;ted Madame to plead her
cau&s;e with the Abate. On the following
morning, therefore, Madame &s;olicited a
private audience of the Abate; &s;he ob|tained
permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee him, and Julia
in trembling anxiety, watched her to
the door of his apartment. The confe|rence
was long, and every moment
&s;eemed an hour to Julia, who, in fear|ful
expectation, awaited with Cornelia
the &s;entence which would decide her
de&s;tiny. She was now the con&s;tant
companion of Cornelia, who&s;e declin|ing
health intere&s;ted her pity, and
&s;trengthened her attachment.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Madame developed to the
Abate the di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tory of Julia. She
<PB N="52" REF="56">
prai&s;ed her virtues, commended her
accompli&s;hments, and deplored her &s;i|tuation.
She de&s;cribed the characters
of the marquis and the duke, and
concluded with pathetically repre&s;ent|ing,
that Julia had &s;ought in this mo|na&s;tery,
a la&s;t a&s;ylum from inju&s;tice and
mi&s;ery, and with entreating that the
Abate would grant her his pity and pro|tection.</P>
<P>The Abate during this di&s;cour&s;e pre|&s;erved
a &s;ullen &s;ilence; his eyes were
bent to the ground, and his a&s;pect was
thoughtful and &s;olemn. When Ma|dame
cea&s;ed to &s;peak, a pau&s;e of pro|found
&s;ilence en&s;ued, and &s;he fat in anxi|ous
expectation. She endeavoured to
anticipate in his countenance the an&s;wer
preparing, but &s;he derived no comfort
from thence. At length rai&s;ing his
head, and awakening from his deep re|verie,
he told her that her reque&s;t re|quired
deliberation, and that the pro|tection
&s;he &s;olicited for Julia, might in|volve
<PB N="53" REF="57">
him in &s;erious con&s;equences, &s;ince
from a character &s;o determined as the
marquis's, much violence might rea&s;on|ably
be expected. "Should his daugh|ter
be refu&s;ed him," concluded the
Abate, "he may even dare to violate
the &s;anctuary."</P>
<P>Madame &s;hocked by the &s;tern indif|ference
of this reply, was a moment
&s;ilent. The Abate went on. "What|ever
I &s;hall determine upon, the young
lady has rea&s;on to rejoice that &s;he is ad|mitted
into this holy hou&s;e; for I will
even now venture to a&s;&s;ure her, that if the
marquis fails to demand her, &s;he &s;hall
be permitted to remain in this &s;anctuary
unmole&s;ted. You, Madam, will be
&s;en&s;ible of this indulgence, and of the
value of the &s;acrifice I make in granting
it; for in thus concealing a child from
her parent, I encourage her in di&s;obedi|ence,
and con&s;equently &s;acrifice my
&s;en&s;e of duty, to what may be ju&s;tly
called a weak humanity."</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="58">
Madame li&s;tened to this pompous de|clamation
in &s;ilent &s;orrow and indig|nation.
She made another effort to in|tere&s;t
the Abate in favour of Julia, but
he pre&s;erved his &s;tern inflexibility, and
repeating that he would deliberate upon
the matter, and acquaint her with the
re&s;ult he aro&s;e with great &s;olemnity,
and quitted the room.</P>
<P>She now half repented of the confi|dence
&s;he had repo&s;ed in him, and of
the pity &s;he had &s;olicited, &s;ince he di&s;|covered
a mind incapable of under&s;tand|ing
the fir&s;t, and a temper inacce&s;&s;ible
to the influence of the latter. With an
heavy heart &s;he returned to Julia, who
read in her countenance, at the moment
&s;he entered the room, news of no hap|py
import. When Madame related the
particulars of the conference, Julia pre|&s;aged
from it only mi&s;ery, and giving
her&s;elf up for lo&s;t&mdash;&s;he bur&s;t into tears.
She &s;everely deplored the confidence
&s;he had been induced to yield; for &s;he
<PB N="55" REF="59">
now &s;aw her&s;elf in the power of a man,
&s;tern and unfeeling in his nature; and
from whom, if he thought it fit to be|tray
her, &s;he had no means of e&s;caping.
But &s;he concealed the angui&s;h of her
heart; and to con&s;ole Madame, affected
to hope where &s;he could only de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Several days elap&s;ed, and no an&s;wer
was returned from the Abate. Julia
too well under&s;tood this &s;ilence.</P>
<P>One morning Cornelia entering her
room with a di&s;turbed and impatient
air, informed her that &s;ome emi&s;&s;aries
from the marquis were then in the mo|na&s;tery,
having enquired at the gate for
the Abate, with whom, they &s;aid, they
had bu&s;ine&s;s of importance to tran&s;act.
The Abate had granted them immediate
audience, and they were now in clo&s;e
conference.</P>
<P>At this intelligence the &s;pirits of Ju|lia
for&s;ook her; &s;he trembled, grew pale,
and &s;tood fixed in mute de&s;pair. Ma|dame,
though &s;carcely le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="56" REF="60">
retained a pre&s;ence of mind. She un|der&s;tood
too ju&s;tly the character of the
Superior, to doubt that he would he&s;i|tate
in delivering Julia to the hands of
the marquis. On this moment, there|fore,
turned the cri&s;is of her fate!&mdash;this
moment &s;he might e&s;cape&mdash;the next &s;he
was a pri&s;oner. She therefore advi&s;ed
Julia to &s;eize the in&s;tant, and fly from
the mona&s;tery before the conference was
concluded, when the gates would mo&s;t
probably be clo&s;ed upon her, a&s;&s;uring
her, at the &s;ame time, &s;he would ac|company
her in flight.</P>
<P>The generous conduct of Madame
called tears of gratitude into the eyes of
Julia, who now awoke from the &s;tate of
&s;tupefaction which di&s;tre&s;s had cau&s;ed.
But before &s;he could thank her faithful
friend, a nun entered the room with a
&s;ummons for Madame to attend the
abate immediately. The di&s;tre&s;s which
this me&s;&s;age occa&s;ioned can not ea&s;ily be
conceived. Madame advi&s;ed Julia to
<PB N="57" REF="61">
e&s;cape while &s;he detained the Abate in
conver&s;ation, as it was not probable that
he had yet i&s;&s;ued orders for her detention.
Leaving her to this attempt, with an a&s;|&s;urance
of following her from the ab|bey
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, Madame obeyed
the &s;ummons. The coolne&s;s of her for|titude
for&s;ook her as &s;he approached the
Abate's apartment, and &s;he became le&s;s
certain as to the occa&s;ion of this &s;um|mons.</P>
<P>The Abate was alone. His counten|ance
was pale with anger, and he was
pacing the room with &s;low but agitated
&s;teps. The &s;tern authority of his look
&s;tartled her. "Read this letter," &s;aid
he, &s;tretching forth his hand which
held a letter, "and tell me what that
mortal de&s;erves, who dares in&s;ult our
holy order, and &s;et our &s;acred preroga|tive
at defiance." Madame di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
the hand writing of the marquis, and
the words of the Superior threw her into
the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. She took the
<PB N="58" REF="62">
letter. It was dictated by that &s;pirit of
proud vindictive rage, which &s;o &s;trongly
marked the character of the marquis.
Having di&s;covered the retreat of Julia,
and believing the mona&s;tery afforded
her a willing &s;anctuary from his pur|&s;uit,
he accu&s;ed the Abate of encourag|ing
his child in open rebellion to his
will. He loaded him and his &s;acred
order with opprobrium, and threatened,
if &s;he was not immediately re&s;igned to
the emi&s;&s;aries in waiting, he would in
per&s;on lead on a force which &s;hould
compel the church to yield to the &s;upe|rior
authority of the father.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the Abate was rou&s;ed by
this menace; and Julia obtained from
his pride, that protection which neither
his principle nor his humanity would
have granted. "The man &s;hall trem|ble,"
cried he,"who dares defy our pow|er,
or que&s;tion our &s;acred authority.
The lady Julia is &s;afe. I will protect
her from this proud invader of our
<PB N="59" REF="63">
rights, and teach him at lea&s;t to vene|rate
the power he cannot conquer. I
have di&s;patched his emi&s;&s;aries with my
an&s;wer."</P>
<P>The&s;e words &s;truck &s;udden joy upon
the heart of Madame de Menon, but
&s;he in&s;tantly recollected, that ere this
time Julia had quitted the abbey, and
thus the very precaution which was
meant to en&s;ure her &s;afety, had probably
precipitated her into the hand of her
enemy. This thought changed her joy
to angui&s;h; and &s;he was hurrying from
the apartment in a &s;ort of wild hope,
that Julia might not yet be gone, when
the &s;ternv oice of the Abate arre&s;ted her.
"Is it thus," cried he,"that you re|ceive
the knowledge of our generous
re&s;olution to protect your friend? Does
&s;uch conde&s;cending kindne&s;s merit no
thanks&mdash;demand no gratitude?" Ma|dame
returned in an agony of fear, left
one moment of delay might prove fatal
to Julia, if haply &s;he had not yet
<PB N="60" REF="64">
quitted the mona&s;tery. She was con|&s;cious
of her deficiency in apparent gra|titude,
and of the &s;trange appearance of
her abrupt departure from the Abate,
for which it was impo&s;&s;ible to apologize,
without betraying the &s;ecret, which
would kindle all his re&s;entment. Yet &s;ome
atonement his pre&s;ent anger demand|ed,
and the&s;e circum&s;tances cau&s;ed her
a very painful embara&s;&s;ment. She
formed a ha&s;ty excu&s;e; and expre&s;&s;ing
her &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, again at|tempted
to retire, when the Abate frown|ing
in deep re&s;entment, his features in|flamed
with pride, aro&s;e from his &s;eat.
"Stay," &s;aid he, "whence this impa|tience
to fly from the pre&s;ence of a be|nefactor?&mdash;If
my genero&s;ity fails to ex|cite
gratitude, my re&s;entment &s;hall not
fail to in&s;pire awe.&mdash;Since the lady Ju|lia
is in&s;en&s;ible of my conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;he
is unworthy of my protection, and I will
re&s;ign her to the tyrant who demands
her."</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="65">
To this &s;peech, in which the offend|ed
pride of the Abate overcoming all
&s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, accu&s;ed and threatened
to puni&s;h Julia for the fault of her
friend, Madame li&s;tened in dreadful
impatience. Every word that detained
her &s;truck torture to her heart, but the
concluding &s;entence occa&s;ioned new ter|ror,
and &s;he &s;tarted at its purpo&s;e. She
fell at the feet of the Abate in an agony
of grief. "Holy father," &s;aid &s;he,
"puni&s;h not Julia for the offence which
I only have committed; her heart
will ble&s;s her generous protector, and
for my&s;elf, &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;ure you that
I am fully &s;en&s;ible of your goodne&s;s."</P>
<P>"If this is true," &s;aid the Abate,
"ari&s;e,and bid the lady Julia attend me."
This command increa&s;ed the confu&s;ion
of Madame, who had no doubt that her
detention had proved fatal to Julia. At
length &s;he was &s;uffered to depart, and
to her infinite joy found Julia in her
own room. Her intention of e&s;caping
<PB N="62" REF="66">
had yielded immediately after the de|parture
of Madame, to the fear of being
di&s;covered by the marquis's people.
This fear had been confirmed by the
report of Cornelia, who informed her,
that at that time &s;everal hor&s;emen were
waiting at the gates for the return of
their companions. This was a dreadful
circum&s;tance to Julia, who perceived it
was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to quit the mo|na&s;tery,
without ru&s;hing upon certain
de&s;truction. She was lamenting her
de&s;tiny, when Madame recited the par|ticulars
of the late interview, and deli|vered
the &s;ummons of the Abate.</P>
<P>They had now to dread the effect of
that tender anxiety, which had excited his
re&s;entment; and Julia &s;uddenly elated to
joy by his fir&s;t determination, was as
&s;uddenly &s;unk to de&s;pair by his la&s;t. She
trembled with apprehen&s;ion of the com|ing
interview, though each moment of
delay, which her fear &s;olicited, would by
heightening the re&s;entment of the Abate,
only increa&s;e the danger &s;he dreaded.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="67">
At length by a &s;trong effort &s;he re|animated
her &s;pirits, and went to the
Abate's clo&s;et to receive her &s;en|tence.
He was &s;eated in his chair, and
his frowning a&s;pect chilled her heart.
"Daughter," &s;aid he, "you have been
guilty of heinous crimes. You have
dared to di&s;pute&mdash;nay openly to rebel,
again&s;t the lawful authority of your fa|ther.
You have di&s;obeyed the will of
him who&s;e prerogative yields only to
ours. You have que&s;tioned his right
upon a point of all others the mo&s;t de|cided&mdash;the
right of a father to di&s;po&s;e
of his child in marriage. You have
even fled from his protection&mdash;and you
have dared&mdash;in&s;idiou&s;ly, and meanly
have dared, to &s;creen your di&s;obedience
beneath this &s;acred roof. You have
prophaned our &s;anctuary with your
crime. You have brought in&s;ult upon
our &s;acred order, and have cau&s;ed bold
and impious defiance of our high prero|gative.
What puni&s;hment is adequate
to guilt like this?"</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="68">
The father pau&s;ed&mdash;his eyes &s;ternly
fixed on Julia, who pale and trembling,
could &s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf, and who
had no power to reply. "I will be
merciful, and not ju&s;t," re&s;umed he,&mdash;"I
will &s;often the puni&s;hment you de|&s;erve,
and will only deliver you to your
father." At the&s;e dreadful words, Julia
bur&s;ting into tears, &s;unk at the feet of
the Abate, to whom &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes
in &s;upplicating expre&s;&s;ion, but was
unable to &s;peak. He &s;uffered her to
remain in this po&s;ture. "Your dupli|city,"
he re&s;umed, "is not the lea&s;t of
your offences.&mdash;Had you relied upon
our genero&s;ity for forgivene&s;s and pro|tection,
an indulgence might have been
granted;&mdash;but under the di&s;gui&s;e of
virtue you concealed your crimes, and
your nece&s;&s;ities were hid beneath the
ma&s;k of devotion."</P>
<P>The&s;e fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions rou&s;ed in Julia
the &s;pirit of indignant virtue; &s;he aro&s;e
from her knees with an air of dignity,
<PB N="65" REF="69">
that &s;truck even the Abate. "Holy fa|ther,"
&s;aid &s;he, "my heart abhors the
crime you mention, and di&s;claims all
union with it. Whatever are my offen|ces&mdash;from
the &s;in of hypocri&s;y I am at
lea&s;t free; and you will pardon me if I
remind you, that my confidence has al|ready
been &s;uch, as fully ju&s;tifies my
claim to the protection I &s;olicit. When
I &s;heltered my&s;elf within the&s;e walls, it
was to be pre&s;umed that they would
protect me from inju&s;tice; and with
what other term than inju&s;tice would
you, Sir, di&s;tingui&s;h the conduct of
the marquis, if the fear of his power
did not overcome the dictates of truth?"</P>
<P>The Abate felt the full force of this
reproof; but di&s;daining to appear &s;en&s;i|ble
to it, re&s;trained his re&s;entment. His
wounded pride thus exa&s;perated, and all
the malignant pa&s;&s;ions of his nature thus
called into action, he was prompted to
that cruel &s;urrender which he had never
before &s;eriou&s;ly intended. The offence
<PB N="66" REF="70">
which Madame de Menon had unin|tentionally
given, his haughty &s;pirit
urged him to retaliate in puni&s;hment.
He had, therefore, plea&s;ed him&s;elf with
exciting a terror which he never meant
to confirm, and he re&s;olved to be fur|ther
&s;olicited for that protection which
he had already determined to grant.
But this reproof of Julia touched him
where he was mo&s;t con&s;cious of defect;
and the temporary triumph which he
imagined it afforded her, kindled his
re&s;entment into flame. He mu&s;ed in
his chair, in a fixed attitude.&mdash;She &s;aw
in his countenance the deep workings
of his mind&mdash;&s;he revolved the fate pre|paring
for her, and &s;tood in trembling
anxiety to receive her &s;entence. The
Abate con&s;idered each aggravating cir|cum&s;tance
of the marquis's menace, and
each &s;entence of Julia's &s;peech; and his
mind experienced, that vice is not only
incon&s;i&s;tent with virtue, but with it&s;elf&mdash;for
to gratify his malignity, he now
<PB N="67" REF="71">
di&s;covered that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;acrifice his pride&mdash;&s;ince it would be
impo&s;&s;ible to puni&s;h the object of the
fir&s;t, without denying him&s;elf the gra|tification
of the former. This reflection
&s;u&s;pended his mind in a &s;tate of torture,
and he &s;at wrapt in gloomy &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit which lately animated Ju|lia,
had vani&s;hed with her words&mdash;each
moment of &s;ilence increa&s;ed her ap|prehen&s;ion;
the deep brooding of his
thoughts confirmed her in the appre|hen&s;ion
of evil, and with all the
artle&s;s eloquence of &s;orrow, &s;he en|deavoured
to &s;often him to pity. He
li&s;tened to her pleadings in &s;ullen &s;till|ne&s;s.
But each in&s;tant now cooled the
fervour of his re&s;entment to her, and
increa&s;ed his de&s;ire of oppo&s;ing the mar|quis.
At length the predominant fea|ture
of his character re&s;umed its origi|nal
influence, and overcame the work|ings
of &s;ubordinate pa&s;&s;ion. Proud of
his religious authority, he determined
<PB N="68" REF="72">
never to yield the prerogative of the
church to that of the father, and re|&s;olved
to oppo&s;e the violence of the
marquis with equal force.</P>
<P>He therefore conde&s;cended to relieve
Julia from her terrors, by a&s;&s;uring her
of his protection; but he did this in
a manner &s;o ungracious, as almo&s;t to
de&s;troy the gratitude which the promi&s;e
demanded. She ha&s;tened with the joy|ful
intelligence to Madame de Menon,
who wept over her tears of thankful|ne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>NEAR a fortnight had elap&s;ed with|out
producing an appearance of
ho&s;tility from the marquis, when one
night, long after the hour of repo&s;e,
Julia was awakened by the bell of the
mona&s;tery. She knew it was not the hour
cu&s;tomary for prayer, and &s;he li&s;tened
to the &s;ounds, which rolled through the
deep &s;ilence of the fabric, with &s;trong
&s;urprize and terror. Pre&s;ently &s;he heard
the doors of &s;everal cells creak on their
hinges, and the &s;ound of quick foot|&s;teps
in the pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;and through the
crevices of her door &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed
pa&s;&s;ing lights. The whi&s;pering noi&s;e
of &s;teps increa&s;ed, and every per&s;on of
the mona&s;tery &s;eemed to have awakened.
Her terror heightened; it occurred to
her that the marquis had &s;urrounded
the abbey with his people, in the de|&s;ign
of forcing her from her retreat;
<PB N="70" REF="74">
and &s;he aro&s;e in ha&s;te, with an intention
of going to the chamber of Madame de
Menon, when &s;he heard a gentle tap at
the door. Her enquiry of who was
there, was an&s;wered in the voice of Ma|dame,
and her fears were quickly di&s;&s;i|pated,
for &s;he learned the bell was a
&s;ummons to attend a dying nun, who
was going to the high altar, there to
receive extreme unction.</P>
<P>She quitted the chamber with Ma|dame.
In her way to the church, the
gleam of tapers on the walls, and the
glimp&s;e which her eye often caught
of the friars in their long black habits,
de&s;cending &s;ilently through the narrow
winding pa&s;&s;ages, with the &s;olemn toll
of the bell, con&s;pired to kindle imagina|tion,
and to impre&s;s her heart with &s;a|cred
awe. But the church exhibited a
&s;cene of &s;olemnity, &s;uch as &s;he had never
before witne&s;&s;ed. Its gloomy ai&s;les were
imperfectly &s;een by the rays of tapers
from the high altar, which &s;hed a &s;oli|tary
<PB N="71" REF="75">
gleam over the remote parts of the fabric,
and produced large ma&s;&s;es of
light and &s;hade, &s;triking and &s;ublime
in their effect.</P>
<P>While &s;he gazed, &s;he heard a di&s;tant
chanting ri&s;e through the ai&s;les; the
&s;ounds &s;welled in low murmurs on the
ear, and drew nearer and nearer, till a
&s;udden blaze of light i&s;&s;ued from one of
the portals, and the proce&s;&s;ion entered.
The organ in&s;tantly &s;ounded a high and
&s;olemn peal, and the voices ri&s;ing alto|gether,
&s;welled the &s;acred &s;train. In
front appeared the <HI>Padre Abate,</HI> with
&s;low and mea&s;ured &s;teps, bearing the
holy cro&s;s. Immediately followed a
litter, on which lay the dying per&s;on
covered with a white veil, borne along,
and &s;urrounded by nuns veiled in white,
each carrying in her hand a lighted
taper. La&s;t came the friars,
two and two, cloathed in black, and each bear|ing
a light.</P>
<P>When they reached the high altar
<PB N="72" REF="76">
the bier was re&s;ted, and in a few moments
the anthem cea&s;ed. The Abate now
approached to perform the unction; the
veil of the dying nun was lifted&mdash;and
Julia di&s;covered her beloved Cornelia!
Her countenance was already impre&s;&s;ed
with the image of death, but her eyes
brightened with a faint gleam of recol|lection,
when they fixed upon Julia,
who felt a cold thrill run through her
frame, and leaned for &s;upport on Ma|dame.
Julia now for the fir&s;t time di&s;|tingui&s;hed
the unhappy lover of Corne|lia,
on who&s;e features was depictured
the angui&s;h of his heart, and who hung
pale and &s;ilent over the bier. The ce|remony
being fini&s;hed, the anthem
&s;truck up; the bier was lifted, when
Cornelia faintly moved her hand, and it
was again re&s;ted upon the &s;teps of the
altar. In a few minutes the mu&s;ic cea&s;|ed;
when lifting her heavy eyes to her
lover, with an expre&s;&s;ion of ineffable
tenderne&s;s and grief, &s;he attempted to
<PB N="73" REF="77">
&s;peak, but the &s;ounds died on her clo&s;|ing
lips. A faint &s;mile pa&s;&s;ed over
her countenance, and was &s;ucceeded
by a fine devotional glow; &s;he folded
her hands upon her bo&s;om, and with a
look of meek re&s;ignation, rai&s;ing tow|ards
heaven her eyes, in which now
&s;unk the la&s;t &s;parkles of expiring life&mdash;her
&s;oul departed in a &s;hort deep &s;igh.</P>
<P>Her lover &s;inking back, endeavoured
to conceal his emotions, but the deep
&s;obs which agitated his brea&s;t, betrayed
his angui&s;h, and the tears of every &s;pec|tator
bedewed the &s;acred &s;pot where
beauty, &s;en&s;e, and innocence expired.</P>
<P>The organ now &s;welled in mournful
harmony; and the voices of the a&s;&s;embly
chanted in choral &s;train, a low and &s;o|lemn
requiem to the &s;pirit of the de|parted.</P>
<P>Madame hurried Julia, who was al|mo&s;t
as lifele&s;s as her departed friend,
from the church. A death &s;o &s;udden,
heightened the grief which &s;epara|tion
<PB N="74" REF="78">
would otherwi&s;e have occa&s;ioned.
It was the nature of Cornelia's di&s;order,
to wear a changeful but flattering a&s;|pect.
Though &s;he had long been de|clining,
her decay was &s;o gradual and
imperceptible, as to lull the apprehen&s;i|ons
of her friends into &s;ecurity.
It was otherwi&s;e with her&s;elf; &s;he was con&s;ci|ous
of the change, but forbore to afflict
them with the knowledge of the truth.
The hour of her di&s;&s;olution was &s;udden,
even to her&s;elf; but it was compo&s;ed,
and even happy. In the death of Cor|nelia
Julia &s;eemed to mourn again that
of Hippolitus. Her decea&s;e appeared
to di&s;&s;olve the la&s;t tie which connected
her with his memory.</P>
<P>In one of the friars of the convent,
Madame was &s;urprized to find the father
who had confe&s;&s;ed the dying Vincent.
His appearance revived the remem|brance
of the &s;cene &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed at
the ca&s;tle of Mazzini; and the la&s;t
words of Vincent, combined with the
circum&s;tances which had &s;ince oc|curred,
<PB N="75" REF="79">
renewed all her curio&s;ity and
a&s;toni&s;hment. But his appearance ex|cited
more &s;en&s;ations than tho&s;e of
wonder. She dreaded, le&s;t he &s;hould
be corrupted by the marquis, to whom
he was known, and thus be induced to
u&s;e his intere&s;t with the <HI>Abate</HI> for the
re&s;toration of Julia.</P>
<P>From the walls of the mona&s;tery, Ju|lia
now never ventured to &s;tray. In the
glooms of evening &s;he &s;ometimes &s;tole
into the cloi&s;ters, and often lingered at
the grave of Cornelia, where &s;he wept
for Hippolitus, as well as for her friend.
One evening, during ve&s;pers, the bell
of the convent was &s;uddenly rang out;
the <HI>Abate,</HI> who&s;e countenance expre&s;&s;ed
at once a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;plea&s;ure,
&s;u&s;pended the &s;ervice, and quitted the altar.
The whole congregation repair|ed
to the hall, where they learned that
a friar, retiring to the convent, had &s;een
a troop of armedmen advancing through
the wood; and not doubting they were
<PB N="76" REF="80">
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> people of the marquis, and were ap|proaching
with ho&s;tile intention, had
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give the alarm.
The <HI>Abate</HI> a&s;cended a turret, and thence
di&s;covered through the trees a glittering
of arms, and in the &s;ucceeding moment
a band of men i&s;&s;ued from a dark part
of the wood, into a long avenue which
immediately fronted the &s;pot where he
&s;tood. The clattering of hoofs was now
di&s;tinctly heard; and Julia, &s;inking with
terror, di&s;tingui&s;hed the marquis head|ing
the troop, which &s;oon after &s;eparat|ing
into two divi&s;ions, &s;urrounded the
mona&s;tery. The gates were imme|diately
&s;ecured; and the <HI>Abate,</HI> de&s;|cending
from the turret, a&s;&s;embled
the friars in the hall, where his voice
was &s;oon heard above every other part
of the tumult. The terror of Julia
made her utterly forgetful of the <HI>Padre's</HI>
promi&s;e, and &s;he wi&s;hed to fly for con|cealment
to the deep caverns be|longing
to the mona&s;tery, which wound
under the woods. Madame, who&s;e pe|netration
<PB N="77" REF="81">
furni&s;hed her with a ju&s;t-know
ledge of the <HI>Abate's</HI> character, founded
her &s;ecurity on his pride. She there|fore
di&s;&s;uaded Julia from attempting to
tamper with the hone&s;ty of a &s;ervant
who had the keys of the vaults, and ad|vi&s;ed
her to rely entirely on the effort of
the <HI>Abate's</HI> re&s;entment towards the mar|quis.
While Madame endeavoured to
&s;oothe her to compo&s;ure, a me&s;&s;age from
the <HI>Abate,</HI> required her immediate atten|dance.
She obeyed, and he bade her fol|low
him to a room which was directly
over the gates of the mona&s;tery. From
thence &s;he &s;aw her father, accompanied
by the duke de Luovo; and as her heart
died away at the &s;ight, the marquis called
furiou&s;ly to the <HI>Abate</HI> to deliver her in|&s;tantly
into his hands, threatening, if &s;he
was detained, to force the gates of the
mona&s;tery. At this threat the coun|tenance
of the <HI>Abate</HI> grew dark; and
leading Julia forcibly to the window,
from which &s;he had &s;hrunk back, "Im|pious
<PB N="78" REF="82">
menacer!" &s;aid he, "eternal ven|geance
be upon thee! From this mo|ment
we expel thee from all the rights
and communities of our church. Ar|rogant
and daring as you are, your
threats I defy." "Look here," &s;aid
he, pointing to Julia, "and learn that
you are in my power; for if you dare
to violate the&s;e &s;acred walls, I will
proclaim aloud in the face of day, a
&s;ecret which &s;hall make your heart's
blood run cold; a &s;ecret which involves
your honour, nay, your very exi&s;tence.
Now triumph and exult in impious me|nace!"
The marquis &s;tarted involunta|rily
at this &s;peech, and his features un|derwent
a &s;udden change, but he endea|voured
to recover him&s;elf, and to con|ceal
his confu&s;ion. He he&s;itated for a
few moments, uncertain how to act&mdash;to
de&s;i&s;t from violence was to confe&s;s him|&s;elf
con&s;cious of the threatened &s;ecret;
yet he dreaded to inflame the re&s;ent|ment
of the <HI>Abate,</HI> who&s;e menaces his
<PB N="79" REF="83">
own heart too &s;urely &s;econded. At
length&mdash;"All that you have uttered,"
&s;aid he, "I de&s;pi&s;e as the da&s;tardly &s;ub|terfuge
of monki&s;h cunning. Your
new in&s;ults add to the de&s;ire of recover|ing
my daughter, that of puni&s;hing you.
I would proceed to in&s;tant violence, but
that would now be an imperfect re|venge.
I &s;hall therefore withdraw my for|ces,
and appeal to a higher power. Thus
&s;hall you be compelled at once to re|&s;tore
my daughter, and retract your
&s;candalous impeachment of my honour
" Saying this, he turned his hor&s;e
from the gates, and his people following him,
quickly withdrew, leaving the <HI>Abate</HI> ex|ulting
in conque&s;t, and Julia lo&s;t in a&s;to|ni&s;hment
and doubtful joy. When &s;he re|counted
to Madame the particulars of the
conference, &s;he dwelt with empha&s;is on
the threats of the <HI>Abate;</HI> but Madame,
though her amazement was heightened
at every word, very well under&s;tood
how the &s;ecret, whatever it was, had
<PB N="80" REF="84">
been obtained. The confe&s;&s;or of Vin|cent
&s;he had already ob&s;erved in the mo|na&s;tery,
and there was no doubt that
he had di&s;clo&s;ed whatever could be col|lected
from the dying words of Vincent.
She knew, al&s;o, that the &s;ecret would
never be publi&s;hed, unle&s;s as a puni&s;h|ment
for immediate violence, it being
one of the fir&s;t principles of mona&s;tic
duty, to ob&s;erve a religious &s;ecrecy upon
all matters intru&s;ted to them in con&s;e&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t tumult of Julia's emo|tions
&s;ub&s;ided, the joy which the &s;ud|den
departure of the marquis occa&s;ion|ed,
yielded to apprehen&s;ion. He had
threatened to appeal to a higher power,
who would compel the <HI>Abate</HI> to &s;urren|der
her. This menace excited a ju&s;t
terror, and there remained no means of
avoiding the tyranny of the marquis, but
by quitting the mona&s;tery. She there|fore
reque&s;ted an audience of the <HI>Abate;</HI>
and having repre&s;ented the danger of
<PB N="81" REF="85">
her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;he intreated his
permi&s;&s;ion to depart in que&s;t of a &s;afer re|treat.
The <HI>Abate,</HI> who well knew the mar|quis
was wholly in his power, laughed
at the repetition of his menaces, and de|nied
her reque&s;t, under pretence of his
having now become re&s;pon&s;ible for her
to the church. He bade her be com|forted,
and promi&s;ed her his protection;
but his a&s;&s;urances were given in &s;o di&s;|tant
and haughty a manner, that Julia
left him with fears, rather increa&s;ed than
&s;ubdued. In cro&s;&s;ing the hall, &s;he ob|&s;erved
a man ha&s;tily enter it from an op|po&s;ite
door. He was not in the habit
of the order, but was muffled up in a
cloak, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h concealment.
As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed he rai&s;ed his head, and Ju|lia
di&s;covered&mdash;her father! He darted
at her a look of vengeance; but, before
&s;he had time even to think, as if &s;uddenly
recollecting him&s;elf, he covered his face,
and ru&s;hed by her. Her trembling
frame could &s;carcely &s;upport her to the
<PB N="82" REF="86">
apartment of Madame, where &s;he &s;unk
&s;peechle&s;s upon a chair, and the horror
of her look alone &s;poke the agony of
her mind. When &s;he was &s;omewhat re|covered,
&s;he related what &s;he had &s;een,
and her conver&s;ation with the <HI>Abate.</HI>
But Madame was lo&s;t in equal perplexi|ty
with her&s;elf, when &s;he attempted to
account for the marquis's appearance.
Why, after his late daring menace,
&s;hould he come &s;ecretly to vi&s;it the
<HI>Abate,</HI> by who&s;e connivance alone he
could have gained admi&s;&s;ion to the mo|na&s;tery?
And what could have influenc|ed
the <HI>Abate</HI> to &s;uch a conduct? The&s;e
circum&s;tances, though equally inex|plicable,
united to confirm a fear of
treachery and &s;urrender. To e&s;cape
from the abbey was now impracticable,
for the gates were con&s;tantly guarded;
and even was it po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s them,
certain detection awaited Julia with|out
from the marquis's people, who
were &s;tationed in the woods. Thus en|compa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="83" REF="87">
with danger, &s;he could only
await in the mona&s;tery the i&s;&s;ue of her
de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>While &s;he was lamenting with Ma|dame
her unhappy &s;tate, &s;he was &s;um|moned
once more to attend the <HI>Abate.</HI>
At this moment her &s;pirits entirely for|&s;ook
her; the cri&s;is of her fate &s;eemed
arrived; for &s;he did not doubt that the
<HI>Abate</HI> intended to &s;urrender her to the
marquis, with whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he
had negociated the terms of accommo|dation.
It was &s;ome time before &s;he
could recover compo&s;ure &s;ufficient to
obey the &s;ummons; and when &s;he did,
every &s;tep that bore her towards the
<HI>Abate</HI>'s room, increa&s;ed her dread. She
pau&s;ed a moment at the door, 'ere &s;he
had courage to open it; the idea of
her father's immediate re&s;entment aro&s;e
to her mind, and &s;he was upon the point
of retreating to her chamber, when a
&s;udden &s;tep within, near the door, de&s;|troyed
her he&s;itation, and &s;he entered the
<PB N="84" REF="88">
clo&s;et. The marquis was not there,
and her &s;pirits revived. The flu&s;h of
triumph was diffu&s;ed over the features
of the <HI>Abate,</HI> though a &s;hade of unap|pea&s;ed
re&s;entment yet remained vi&s;ible.
"Daughter," &s;aid he, "the intelli|gence
we have to communicate may re|joice
you. Your &s;afety now depends
&s;olely on your&s;elf. I give your fate
into your own hands, and its i&s;&s;ue be
upon your head." He pau&s;ed, and
&s;he was &s;u&s;pended in wondering ex|pectation
of the coming &s;entence. "I
here &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you of my protec|tion,
but it is upon one condition only&mdash;that
you renounce the world, and de|dicate
your days to God." Julia li&s;ten|ed
with a mixture of grief and a&s;toni&s;h|ment.
"Without this conce&s;&s;ion on
your part, I po&s;&s;e&s;s not the power, had
I even the inclination, to protect you.
If you a&s;&s;ume the veil, you are &s;afe
within the pale of the church from tem|poral
violence. If you neglect or re|fu&s;e
<PB N="85" REF="89">
to do this, the marquis may apply
to a power from whom I have no ap|peal,
and I &s;hall be compelled at la&s;t to
re&s;ign you."</P>
<P>"But to en&s;ure your &s;afety, &s;hould
the veil be your choice, we will procure
a di&s;pen&s;ation from the u&s;ual forms of
noviciation, and a few days &s;hall con|firm
your vows." He cea&s;ed to &s;peak;
but Julia, agitated with the mo&s;t cruel
di&s;tre&s;s, knew not what to reply. "We
grant you three days to decide upon
this matter," continued he, "at the ex|piration
of which, the veil, or the duke
de Luovo, awaits you." Julia quitted
the clo&s;et in mute de&s;pair, and re|paired
to Madame, who could now
&s;carcely offer her the humble benefit of
con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the <HI>Abate</HI> exulted in &s;uc|ce&s;sful
vengeance, and the marquis
&s;marted beneath the &s;tings of di&s;appoint|ment.
The menace of the former was too
&s;eriou&s;ly alarming to &s;uffer the marquis
<PB N="86" REF="90">
to pro&s;ecute violent mea&s;ures; and he
had therefore re&s;olved, by oppo&s;ing ava|rice
to pride, to &s;oothe the power which
he could not &s;ubdue. But he was unwil|ling
to entru&s;t the <HI>Abate</HI> with a proof
of his compliance and his fears, by of|fering
a bribe in a letter, and preferred
the more humiliating, but &s;afer method,
of a private interview. His magnifi|cent
offers created a temporary he&s;ita|tion
in the mind of the <HI>Abate,</HI> who, &s;e|cure
of his advantage, &s;hewed at fir&s;t no
di&s;po&s;ition to be reconciled, and &s;uffer|ed
the marquis to depart in anxious un|certainty.
After maturely deliberating
upon the propo&s;als, the pride of the
<HI>Abate</HI> &s;urmounted his avarice; and he
determined to prevail upon Julia effec|tually
to de&s;troy the hopes of the mar|quis,
by con&s;ecrating her life to reli|gion.
Julia pa&s;&s;ed the night and the
next day in a &s;tate of mental torture ex|ceeding
all de&s;cription. The gates of
the mona&s;tery be&s;et with guards, and the
<PB N="87" REF="91">
woods &s;urrounded by the marquis's
people, made e&s;cape impo&s;&s;ible. From
a marriage with the duke, who&s;e late
conduct had confirmed the odious idea
which his character had formerly im|pre&s;&s;ed,
her heart recoiled in horror,
and to be immured for life within the
walls of a convent, was a fate little le&s;s
dreadful. Yet &s;uch was the effect of
that &s;acred love &s;he bore the memory
of Hippolitus, and &s;uch her aver&s;ion to
the duke, that &s;he &s;oon re&s;olved to
adopt the veil. On the following even|ing
&s;he informed the <HI>Abate</HI> of her de|termination.
His heart &s;welled with
&s;ecret joy; and even the natural &s;everity
of his manner relaxed at the intelli|gence.
He a&s;&s;ured her of his approba|tion
and protection, with a degree of
kindne&s;s which he had never before
manife&s;ted, and told her the ceremony
&s;hould be performed on the &s;econd day
from the pre&s;ent. Her emotion &s;carce|ly
&s;uffered her to hear his la&s;t words.</P>

Now that her fate was fixed beyond re|call,
&s;he almo&s;t repented of her choice.
Her fancy attached to it a horror not
its own; and that evil, which, when
offered to her deci&s;ion, &s;he had accept|ed
with little he&s;itation, &s;he now pau&s;ed
upon in dubious regret; &s;o apt we are
to imagine that the calamity mo&s;t cer|tain,
is al&s;o the mo&s;t intolerable!</P>
<P>When the marquis read the an&s;wer of
the <HI>Abate,</HI> all the baleful pa&s;&s;ions of his
nature were rou&s;ed and inflamed to a
degree which bordered upon di&s;traction.
In the fir&s;t impul&s;e of his rage, he
would have forced the gates of the mo|na&s;tery,
and defied the utmo&s;t malice
of his enemy. But a moment's reflection
revived his fear of the threatened &s;e|cret,
and he &s;aw that he was &s;till in the
power of the Superior.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abate</HI> procured the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;|pen&s;ation,
and preparations were imme|diately
began for the approaching ce|remony.
Julia watched the departure
<PB N="89" REF="93">
of tho&s;e moments which led to her fate
with the calm fortitude of de&s;pair. She
had no means of e&s;caping from the
coming evil, without expo&s;ing her&s;elf to
a wor&s;e; &s;he &s;urveyed it therefore with
a &s;teady eye, and no longer &s;hrunk from
its approach.</P>
<P>On the morning preceding the day
of her con&s;ecration, &s;he was informed
that a &s;tranger enquired for her at the
grate. Her mind had been &s;o long ac|cu&s;tomed
to the vici&s;&s;itudes of appre|hen&s;ion,
that fear was the emotion which
now occurred; &s;he &s;u&s;pected, yet &s;carce|ly
knew why, that the marquis was be|low,
and he&s;itated whether to de&s;cend.
A little reflection determined her, and
&s;he went to the parlour&mdash;where to
her equal joy and &s;urprize &s;he beheld&mdash;Ferdinand!</P>
<P>During the ab&s;ence of the marquis
from his ca&s;tle, Ferdinand, who had
been informed of the di&s;covery of Julia,
effected his e&s;cape from impri&s;onment,
<PB N="90" REF="94">
and had ha&s;tened to the mona&s;tery in the
de&s;ign of re&s;cuing her. He had pa&s;&s;ed
the woods in di&s;gui&s;e, with much dif|ficulty
eluding the ob&s;ervation of the
marquis's people, who were yet di&s;per&s;|ed
round the abbey. To the mona&s;tery,
as he came alone, he had been admitted
without difficulty.</P>
<P>When he learned the conditions of
the <HI>Abate</HI>'s protection, and that the fol|lowing
day was appointed for the con|&s;ecration
of Julia, he was &s;hocked, and
pau&s;ed in deliberation. A period &s;o
&s;hort as was this interval, afforded little
opportunity for contrivance, and le&s;s
for he&s;itation. The night of the pre&s;ent
day was the only time that remained for
the attempt and execution of a plan of
e&s;cape, which if it then failed of &s;ucce&s;s,
Julia would not only be condemned for
life to the walls of a mona&s;tery, but
would be &s;ubjected to whatever puni&s;h|ment
the &s;everity of the <HI>Abate,</HI> exa&s;pe|rated
by the detection, &s;hould think fit
<PB N="91" REF="95">
to inflict. The danger was de&s;perate,
but the occa&s;ion was de&s;perate al&s;o.</P>
<P>The nobly di&s;intere&s;ted conduct of
her brother, &s;truck Julia with gratitude
and admiration; but de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s,
made her now he&s;itate whether &s;he
&s;hould accept his offer. She con&s;idered
that his genero&s;ity would mo&s;t probably
involve him in de&s;truction with her&s;elf;
and &s;he pau&s;ed in deep deliberation,
when Ferdinand informed her of a cir|cum&s;tance
which, till now, he had pur|po&s;ely
concealed, and which at once di&s;|&s;olved
every doubt and every fear.
"Hippolitus," &s;aid Ferdinand, "yet
lives." "Lives!" repeated Julia faint|ly,&mdash;"lives!
Oh! tell me where&mdash;how."&mdash;Her
breath refu&s;ed to aid her, and &s;he
&s;unk in her chair, overcome with the
&s;trong and various &s;en&s;ations that pre&s;&s;ed
upon her heart. Ferdinand, whom the
grate with-held from a&s;&s;i&s;ting her, ob|&s;erved
her &s;ituation in extreme di&s;tre&s;s.
When &s;he recovered, he informed her
<PB N="92" REF="96">
that a &s;ervant of Hippolitus, &s;ent no
doubt by his lord to enquire concern|ing
Julia, had been lately &s;een by one
of the marquis's people in the neigh|bourhood
of the ca&s;tle. From him it
was known that the count de Vereza
was living, but that his life had been
de&s;paired of; and he was &s;till confined,
by dangerous wounds, in an ob&s;cure
town on the coa&s;t of Italy. The man
had &s;teadily refu&s;ed to mention the place
of his lord's abode. Learning that the
marquis was then at the abbey of St.
Augu&s;tin, whither he pur&s;ued his daugh|ter,
the man di&s;appeared from Maz|zini,
and had not &s;ince been heard of.</P>
<P>It was enough for Julia to know that
Hippolitus lived; her fears of detec|tion,
and her &s;cruples concerning Fer|dinand,
in&s;tantly vani&s;hed; &s;he thought
only of e&s;cape&mdash;and the means which
had lately appeared &s;o formidable&mdash;&s;o
difficult in contrivance, and &s;o danger|ous
in execution, now &s;eemed ea&s;y,
certain, and almo&s;t accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="97">
They con&s;ulted on the plan to be adopt|ed;
and agreed, that in attempting to
bribe a &s;ervant of the mona&s;tery to their
intere&s;t, they &s;hould incur a danger too
eminent, yet it appeared &s;carcely prac|ticable
to &s;ucceed in their &s;cheme with|out
ri&s;quing this. After much con|&s;ideration,
they determined to entru&s;t
their &s;ecret to no per&s;on but to Madame.
Ferdinand was to contrive to conceal
him&s;elf till the dead of night in the
church, between which and the mona&s;|tery
were &s;everal doors of communica|tion.
When the inhabitants of the ab|bey
were &s;unk in repo&s;e, Julia might
without difficulty pa&s;s to the church,
where Ferdinand awaiting her, they
might perhaps e&s;cape either through an
outer door of the fabric, or through a
window, for which latter attempt Ferdi|nand
was to provide ropes.</P>
<P>A couple of hor&s;es were to be &s;tationed
among the rocks beyond the woods, to
convey the fugitives to a &s;ea-port, whence
<PB N="94" REF="98">
they could ea&s;ily pa&s;s over to Italy.
Having arranged this plan, they &s;e|parated
in the anxious hope of meeting
on the en&s;uing night.</P>
<P>Madame warmly &s;ympathized with Ju|lia
in her pre&s;ent expectations, and was
now &s;omewhat relieved from the pre&s;|&s;ure
of that &s;elf reproach, with which the
con&s;ideration of having withdrawn Ju|lia
from a &s;ecure a&s;ylum, had long
tormented her. In learning that Hip|politus
lived, Julia experienced a &s;ud|den
renovation of life and &s;pirits. From
the languid &s;tupefaction which de&s;pair
had occa&s;ioned &s;he revived as from a
dream, and her &s;en&s;ations re&s;embled
tho&s;e of a per&s;on &s;uddenly awakened
from a frightful vi&s;ion, who&s;e thoughts
are yet ob&s;cured in the fear and uncer|tainty
which the pa&s;&s;ing images have
impre&s;&s;ed on his fancy. She emerged
from de&s;pair; joy illumined her coun|tenance;
yet &s;he doubted the reality of
the &s;cene which now opened to her
<PB N="95" REF="99">
view. The hours rolled heavily along
till the evening, when expectation gave
way to fear, for &s;he was once more &s;um|moned
by the <HI>Abate.</HI> He &s;ent for her
to admini&s;ter the u&s;ual nece&s;&s;ary exhor|tation
on the approaching &s;olemnity;
and having detained her a con&s;iderable
time in tedious and &s;evere di&s;cour&s;e,
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with a formal benedic|tion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE evening now &s;unk in darkne&s;s,
and the hour was fa&s;t approach|ing
which would decide the fate of Julia.
Trembling anxiety now &s;ubdued every
other &s;en&s;ation; and as the minutes
pa&s;&s;ed, her fears increa&s;ed. At length
&s;he heard the gates of the mona&s;tery
fa&s;tened for the night; the bell rang
the &s;ignal for repo&s;e; and the pa&s;&s;ing
foot&s;teps of the nuns told her they were
ha&s;tening to obey it. After &s;ome time,
all was &s;ilent. Julia did not yet dare to
venture forth; &s;he employed the pre|&s;ent
interval in interesting and affection|ate
conver&s;ation with Madame de Me|non,
to whom, notwith&s;tanding her &s;i|tuation,
her heart bade a &s;orrowful adieu.</P>
<P>The clock &s;truck twelve, when &s;he
aro&s;e to depart. Having embraced her
faithful friend with tears of mingled
<PB N="97" REF="101">
grief and anxiety, &s;he took a lamp in
her hand, and with cautious, fearful
&s;teps de&s;cended through the long wind|ing
pa&s;&s;ages to a private door, which
opened into the church of the mona&s;|tery.
The church was gloomy and de&s;o|late;
and the feeble rays of the lamp &s;he
bore, gave only light enough to di&s;|cover
its chilling grandeur. As &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ilently along the ai&s;les, &s;he ca&s;t
a look of anxious examination around&mdash;but
Ferdinand was no where to be
&s;een. She pau&s;ed in timid he&s;itation,
fearful to penetrate the gloomy ob&s;cu|rity
which lay before her, yet dreading
to return.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;tood examining the place,
vainly looking for Ferdinand, yet fear|ing
to call le&s;t her voice &s;hould betray
her, a hollow groan aro&s;e from a part of
the church very near her. It chilled
her heart, and &s;he remained fixed to the
&s;pot. She turned her eyes a little to
the left, and &s;aw light appear through
<PB N="98" REF="102">
the chinks of a &s;epulchre at &s;ome di&s;|tance.
The groan was repeated&mdash;a low
murmuring &s;ucceeded, and while &s;he
yet gazed, an old man i&s;&s;ued from the
vault with a lighted taper in his hand.
Terror now &s;ubdued her, and &s;he utter|ed
an involuntary &s;hriek. In the &s;uc|ceeding
moment, a noi&s;e was heard in
a remote part of the fabric; and Ferdi|nand
ru&s;hing forth from his conceal|ment,
ran to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The old
man, who appeared to be a friar, and
who had been doing penance at the mo|nument
of a &s;aint, now approached.
His countenance expre&s;&s;ed a degree of
&s;urprize and terror almo&s;t equal to that
of Julia's, who now knew him to be
the confe&s;&s;or of Vincent. Ferdinand
&s;eized the father; and laying his hand
upon his &s;word, threatened him with
death if he did not in&s;tantly &s;wear to
conceal for ever his knowledge of what
he then &s;aw, and al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t them to
e&s;cape from the abbey.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="103">
"Ungracious boy!" replied the fa|ther
in a calm voice, "de&s;i&s;t from this
language, nor add to the follies of youth
the crime of murdering, or terrifying
a defencele&s;s old man. Your violence
would urge me to become your enemy,
did not previous inclination tempt me
to be your friend. I pity the di&s;tre&s;&s;es
of the lady Julia, to whom I am no &s;tran|ger,
and will cheerfully give her all the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words Julia revived, and
Ferdinand, reproved by the genero&s;ity
of the father, and con&s;cious of his own
inferiority, &s;hrunk back. "I have no
words to thank you," &s;aid he, "or to
entreat your pardon for the impetuo&s;ity
of my conduct; your knowledge of my
&s;ituation mu&s;t plead my excu&s;e." "It
does," replied the father, "but we
have no time to lo&s;e;&mdash;follow me. "</P>
<P>They followed him through the church
to the cloi&s;ters, at the extremity of which
was a &s;mall door, which the friar un|locked.
It opened upon the woods.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="104">
"This path," &s;aid he, "leads
through an intricate part of the woods,
to the rocks that ri&s;e on the right of the
abbey; in their rece&s;&s;es you may &s;ecrete
your&s;elves till you are prepared for a
longer journey. But extingui&s;h your
light; it may betray you to the mar|quis's
people, who are di&s;per&s;ed about
this &s;pot. Farewell! my children, and
God's ble&s;&s;ing be upon ye."</P>
<P>Julia's tears declared her gratitude;
&s;he had no time for words. They &s;tep|ped
into the path, and the father clo&s;ed
the door. They were now liberated
from the mona&s;tery, but danger awaited
them without, which it required all their
caution to avoid. Ferdinand knew the
path which the friar had pointed out,
to be the &s;ame that led to the rocks
where his hor&s;es were &s;tationed, and he
pur&s;ued it with quick and &s;ilent &s;teps.
Julia, who&s;e fears con&s;pired with the
gloom of night to magnify and tran&s;|form
every object around her, ima|gined
<PB N="101" REF="105">
at each &s;tep that &s;he took, &s;he
perceived the figures of men, and fan|cied
every whi&s;per of the breeze the
&s;ound of pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>They proceeded &s;wiftly, till Julia
breathle&s;s and exhau&s;ted could go no
farther. They had not re&s;ted many
minutes, when they heard a ru&s;tling
among the bu&s;hes at &s;ome di&s;tance, and
&s;oon after di&s;tingui&s;hed a low &s;ound
of voices. Ferdinand and Julia in&s;tant|ly
renewed their flight, and thought
they &s;till heard voices advance upon the
wind. This thought was &s;oon confirm|ed,
for the &s;ounds now gained fa&s;t upon
them, and they di&s;tingui&s;hed words
which &s;erved only to heighten their ap|prehen&s;ions
when they reached the ex|tremity
of the woods. The moon, which
was now up, &s;uddenly emerging from
a dark cloud, di&s;covered to them &s;eve|ral
men in pur&s;uit; and al&s;o &s;hewed to
the pur&s;uers the cour&s;e of the fugitives.
They endeavoured to gain the rocks
where the hor&s;es were concealed, and
<PB N="102" REF="106">
which now appeared in view. The&s;e they
reached when the pur&s;uers had almo&s;t
overtaken them&mdash;but their hor&s;es were
gone! Their only remaining chance of
e&s;cape was to fly into the deep rece&s;&s;es
of the rock. They, therefore, entered
a winding cave from whence branched
&s;everal &s;ubterraneous avenues, at the ex|tremity
of one of which they &s;topped.
The voices of men now vibrated in tre|mendous
echoes through the various
and &s;ecret caverns of the place, and the
&s;ound of foot&s;teps &s;eemed fa&s;t approach|ing.
Julia trembled with terror, and
Ferdinand drew his &s;word, determined
to protect her to the la&s;t. A confu&s;ed
volley of voices now &s;ounded up that
part of the cave where Ferdinand and
Julia lay concealed. In a few moments
the &s;teps of the pur&s;uers &s;uddenly took
a different direction, and the &s;ounds
&s;unk gradually away, and were heard no
more. Ferdinand li&s;tened attentively
for a con&s;iderable time, but the &s;tillne&s;s
<PB N="103" REF="107">
of the place remained undi&s;turbed. It
was now evident that the men had quit|ted
the rock, and he ventured forth to
the mouth of the cave. He &s;urveyed
the wilds around, as far as his eye could
penetrate, and di&s;tingui&s;hed no human
being; but in the pau&s;es of the wind he
&s;till thought he heard a &s;ound of di&s;tant
voices. As he li&s;tened in anxious &s;i|lence,
his eye caught the appearance of
a &s;hadow, which moved upon the ground
near where he &s;tood. He &s;tarted back
within the cave, but in a few minutes
again ventured forth. The &s;hadow re|mained
&s;tationary; but having watched
it for &s;ome time, Ferdinand &s;aw it glide
along till it di&s;appeared behind a point
of rock. He had now no doubt that
the cave was watched, and that it was
one of his late pur&s;uers who&s;e &s;hade
he had &s;een. He returned, therefore,
to Julia, and remained near an hour hid
in the deepe&s;t rece&s;s of the rock; when,
no &s;ound having interrupted the pro|found
<PB N="104" REF="108">
&s;ilence of the place, he at length
once more ventured to the mouth of the
cave. Again he threw a fearful look
around, but di&s;cerned no human form.
The &s;oft moon-beam &s;lept upon the
dewy land&s;cape, and the &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s
of midnight wrapt the world. Fear
heightened to the fugitives the &s;ublimi|ty
of the hour. Ferdinand now led Ju|lia
forth, and they pa&s;&s;ed &s;ilently along
the &s;helving foot of the rocks.</P>
<P>They continued their way without
farther interruption; and among the
cliffs at &s;ome di&s;tance from the cave,
di&s;covered to their inexpre&s;&s;ible joy,
their hor&s;es, who having broken their
fa&s;tenings, had &s;trayed thither, and had
now laid them&s;elves down to re&s;t. Fer|dinand
and Julia immediately mounted;
and de&s;cending to the plains, took the
road that led to a &s;mall &s;ea port at &s;ome
leagues di&s;tance, whence they could
embark for Italy.</P>
<P>They travelled for &s;ome hours through
<PB N="105" REF="109">
gloomy fore&s;ts of beech and che&s;nut;
and their way was only faintly illumi|nated
by the moon, which &s;hed a tremb|ling
lu&s;tre through the dark foliage, and
which was &s;een but at intervals, as the
pa&s;&s;ing clouds yielded to the power of
her rays. They reached at length the
&s;kirts of the fore&s;t. The grey dawn
now appeared, and the chill morning
air bit &s;hrewdly. It was with inex|pre&s;&s;ible
joy that Julia ob&s;erved the
kindling atmo&s;phere; and &s;oon after the
rays of the ri&s;ing &s;un touching the tops
of the mountains, who&s;e &s;ides were yet
involved in dark vapours.</P>
<P>Her fears di&s;&s;ipated with the dark|ne&s;s.&mdash;The
&s;un now appeared amid
clouds of inconceivable &s;plendour; and
unveiled a &s;cene which in other circum|&s;tances
Julia would have contemplated
with rapture. From the &s;ide of the hill,
down which they were winding, a vale
appeared, from whence aro&s;e wild and
lofty mountains, who&s;e &s;ides were cloath|ed
<PB N="106" REF="110">
with hanging woods, except where
here and there a precipice projected its
bold and rugged front. Here a few
half withered trees hung from the cre|vices
of the rock, and gave a picture&s;que
wildne&s;s to the object; there clu&s;ters of
half &s;een cottages, ri&s;ing from among
tufted groves, embelli&s;hed the green
margin of a &s;tream which meandered in
the bottom, and bore its waves to the
blue and distant main.</P>
<P>The fre&s;hne&s;s of morning breathed
over the &s;cene, and vivified each colour
of the land&s;cape. The bright dew-drops
hung trembling from the branches of
the trees, which at intervals over&s;ha|dowed
the road; and the &s;prightly mu&s;ic
of the birds &s;aluted the ri&s;ing day. Not|with&s;tanding
her anxiety, the &s;cene dif|fu&s;ed
a &s;oft complacency over the mind
of Julia.</P>
<P>About noon they reached the port,
where Ferdinand was fortunate enough
to obtain a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el; but the wind
<PB N="107" REF="111">
was unfavourable, and it was pa&s;t mid|night
before it was po&s;&s;ible for them to
embark.</P>
<P>When the dawn appeared, Julia re|turned
to the deck; and viewed with a
&s;igh of unaccountable regret, the reced|ing
coa&s;t of Sicily. But &s;he ob&s;erved
with high admiration, the light gra|dually
&s;preading through the atmo|&s;phere,
darting a feeble ray over the &s;ur|face
of the waters, which rolled in &s;o|lemn
&s;oundings upon the di&s;tant &s;hores.
Fiery beams now marked the clouds,
and the ea&s;t glowed with encrea&s;ing ra|diance,
till the &s;un ro&s;e at once above
the waves, and illuminating them with
a flood of &s;plendour, diffu&s;ed gaiety and
gladne&s;s around. The bold concave of
the heavens, uniting with the va&s;t ex|pan&s;e
of the ocean; formed a <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI>
&s;triking and &s;ublime. The magnifi|cence
of the &s;cenery in&s;pired Julia with
delight; and her heart dilating with
high enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;he forgot the &s;orrows
which had oppre&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="112">
The breeze wa&s;ted the &s;hip gently along
for &s;ome hours, when it gradually &s;unk
into a calm. The gla&s;&s;y &s;urface of the
waters was not curled by the lighte&s;t air,
and the ve&s;&s;el floated heavily on the bo|&s;om
of the deep. Sicily was yet in view,
and the pre&s;ent delay agitated Julia with
wild apprehen&s;ion. Towards the clo&s;e
of day a light breeze &s;prang up, but it
blew from Italy, and a train of dark va|pours
emerged from the verge of the
horizon, which gradually accumulat|ing,
the heavens became entirely over|ca&s;t.
The evening &s;hut in &s;uddenly:
the ri&s;ing wind, the heavy clouds that
loaded the atmo&s;phere, and the thunder
which murmured afar off, terrified Julia,
and threatened a violent &s;torm.</P>
<P>The tempe&s;t came on, and the cap|tain
vainly &s;ounded for anchorage: it
was deep &s;ea, and the ve&s;&s;el drove furi|ou&s;ly
before the wind. The darkne&s;s
was interrupted only at intervals, by the
broad expan&s;e of vivid lightnings,
<PB N="109" REF="113">
which quivered upon the waters, and
di&s;clo&s;ing the horrible ga&s;pings of the
waves, &s;erved to render the &s;ucceed|ing
darkne&s;s more awful. The thun|der
which bur&s;t in tremendous cra&s;hes
above, the loud roar of the waves be|low,
the noi&s;e of the &s;ailors, and the &s;ud|den
cracks and groanings of the ve&s;&s;el,
con&s;pired to heighten the tremendous
&s;ublimity of the &s;cene.</P>
<LG>
<L>Far on the rocky &s;hores the &s;urges &s;ound,</L>
<L>The la&s;hing whirlwinds cleave the va&s;t pro|found;</L>
<L>While high in air, amid the ri&s;ing &s;torm,</L>
<L>Driving the bla&s;t, &s;its, Danger's black'ning form.</L>
</LG>
<P>Julia lay fainting with terror and &s;ick|ne&s;s
in the cabin, and Ferdinand though
almo&s;t hopele&s;s him&s;elf was endeavour|ing
to &s;upport her, when a loud and
dreadful cra&s;h was heard from above.
It &s;eemed as if the whole ve&s;&s;el had
parted. The voices of the &s;ailors now
ro&s;e together, and all was confu&s;ion and
uproar. Ferdinand ran up to the deck,
<PB N="110" REF="114">
and learned that the main ma&s;t, borne
away by the wind, had fallen upon the
deck, whence it had rolled overboard.</P>
<P>It was now pa&s;t midnight, and the
&s;torm continued with unabated fury.
For four hours the ve&s;&s;el had been dri|ven
before the bla&s;t; and the captain
now declaring it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he
could weather the tempe&s;t much longer,
ordered the long boat to be in readine&s;s.
His orders were &s;carcely executed, when
the &s;hip bulged upon a reef of rocks,
and the impetuous waves ru&s;hed into the
ve&s;&s;el:&mdash;a general groan en&s;ued. Fer|dinand
flew to &s;ave his &s;i&s;ter, whom he
carried to the boat, which was nearly
filled by the captain and mo&s;t of the
crew. The &s;ea ran &s;o high that it ap|peared
impracticable to reach the &s;hore;
but the boat had not moved many
yards, when the &s;hip went to pieces.
The captain now perceived by the &s;la&s;h|es
of lightning, a high rocky coa&s;t at
about the di&s;tance of half a mile. The
<PB N="111" REF="115">
men &s;truggled hard at the oars; but
almo&s;t as often as they gained the &s;um|mit
of a wave, it da&s;hed them back
again, and made their labour of little
avail.</P>
<P>After much difficulty and fatigue
they reached the coa&s;t, where a new dan|ger
pre&s;ented it&s;elf. They beheld a
wild rocky &s;hore, who&s;e cliffs appeared
inacce&s;&s;ible, and which &s;eemed to afford
little po&s;&s;ibility of landing. A landing
however was at la&s;t effected; and the
&s;ailors, after much &s;earch, di&s;covered a
kind of path way cut in the rock, which
they all a&s;cended in &s;afety.</P>
<P>The dawn now faintly glimmered,
and they &s;urveyed the coa&s;t, but could
di&s;cover no human habitation. They ima|gined
they were on the &s;hores of Sicily,
but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no means of confirming
this conjecture. Terror, &s;ickne&s;s, and fa|tigue
had &s;ubdued the &s;trength and &s;pi|rits
of Julia, and &s;he was obliged to re&s;t
upon the rocks.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="116">
The &s;torm now &s;uddenly &s;ub&s;ided,
and the total calm which &s;ucceeded to
the wild tumult of the winds and waves,
produced a &s;triking and &s;ublime effect.
The air was hu&s;hed in a deathlike &s;till|ne&s;s,
but the waves were yet violently
agitated; and by the encrea&s;ing light,
parts of the wreck were &s;een floating wide
upon the face of the deep. Some &s;ai|lors
who had mi&s;&s;ed the boat were al&s;o
di&s;covered clinging to pieces of the ve&s;|&s;el,
and making towards the &s;hore. On
ob&s;erving this, their &s;hipmates imme|diately
de&s;cended to the boat; and put|ting
off to &s;ea, re&s;cued them from their
perilous &s;ituation. When Julia was
&s;omewhat re-animated, they proceeded
up the country in &s;earch of a dwelling.</P>
<P>They had travelled near half a league,
when the &s;avage features of the coun|try
began to &s;often, and gradually
changed to the picture&s;que beauty of
Sicilian &s;cenery. They now di&s;covered
at &s;ome di&s;tance a villa, &s;eated on a gen|tle
<PB N="113" REF="117">
eminence crowned with woods. It
was the fir&s;t human habitation they had
&s;een &s;ince they embarked for Italy; and
Julia, who was almo&s;t &s;inking with fa|tigue,
beheld it with delight. The cap|tain
and his men ha&s;tened towards it to
make known their di&s;tre&s;s, while Ferdi|nand
and Julia &s;lowly followed. They
ob&s;erved the men enter the villa, one of
whom quickly returned to acquaint
them with the ho&s;pitable reception his
comrades had received.</P>
<P>Julia with difficulty reached the edi|fice,
at the door of which &s;he was met
by a young cavalier, who&s;e plea&s;ing
and intelligent countenance immediately
intere&s;ted her in his favour. He wel|comed
the &s;trangers with a benevolent
politene&s;s, that di&s;&s;olved at once every
uncomfortable feeling which their &s;itua|tion
had excited, and produced an in|&s;tantaneous
ea&s;y confidence. Through
a light and elegant hall, ri&s;ing into a
dome, &s;upported by pillars of white
<PB N="114" REF="118">
marble, and adorned with bu&s;ts; he led
them to a magnificent ve&s;tibule, which
opened upon a lawn. Having &s;eated
them at a table &s;pread with refre&s;hments;
he left them, and they &s;urveyed with
&s;urprize, the beauty of the adjacent
&s;cene.</P>
<P>The lawn, which was on each &s;ide
bounded by hanging woods, de&s;cended
in gentle declivity to a fine lake, who&s;e
&s;mooth &s;urface reflected the &s;urrounding
&s;hades. Beyond appeared the di&s;tant coun|try,
ri&s;ing on the left into bold romantic
mountains, and on the right, exhibiting
a &s;oft and glowing land&s;cape, who&s;e
tranquil beauty formed a &s;triking con|tra&s;t
to the wild &s;ublimity of the oppo|&s;ite
craggy heights. The blue and di&s;|tant
ocean terminated the view.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time the cavalier returned,
conducting two ladies of a very engag|ing
appearance, whom he pre&s;ented as
his wife and &s;i&s;ter. They welcomed
Julia with graceful kindne&s;s; but fa|tigue
<PB N="115" REF="119">
&s;oon obliged her to retire to re&s;t,
and a con&s;equent indi&s;po&s;ition encrea&s;ed
&s;o rapidly, as to render it impracticable
for her to quit her pre&s;ent abode on that
day. The captain and his men pro|ceeded
on their way, leaving Ferdinand
and Julia at the villa, where &s;he ex|perienced
every kind and tender affec|tion.</P>
<P>The day which was to have devoted
Julia to a cloi&s;ter, was u&s;hered in at
the abbey with the u&s;ual ceremonies.
The church was ornamented, and all the
inhabitants of the mona&s;tery prepared to
attend. The <HI>Padre Abate</HI> now exulted in
the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme, and anticipated
in imagination, the rage and vexation
of the marquis, when he &s;hould di&s;cover
that his daughter was lo&s;t to him for
ever.</P>
<P>The hour of celebration arrived, and
he entered the church with a proud
firm &s;tep, and with a countenance
which depictured his inward triumph;
<PB N="116" REF="120">
he was proceeding to the high altar,
when he was told that Julia was no
where to be found. A&s;toni&s;hment for
a while &s;u&s;pended other emotions,&mdash;he
yet believed it impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he could
have effected an e&s;cape, and ordered
every part of the abbey to be &s;earched&mdash;not
forgetting the &s;ecret caverns be|longing
to the mona&s;tery, which wound
beneath the woods. When the &s;earch
was over, and he became convinced &s;he
was fled; the deep workings of his di&s;|appointed
pa&s;&s;ions fermented into rage
which exceeded all bounds. He de|nounced
the mo&s;t terrible judgments
upon Julia; and calling for Madame de
Menon, charged her with having in&s;ult|ed
her holy religion, in being acce&s;&s;ary
to the flight of Julia. Madame endur|ed
the&s;e reproaches with calm dignity,
and pre&s;erved a &s;teady &s;ilence; but &s;he
&s;ecretly determined to leave the mona&s;|tery,
and &s;eek in another, the repo&s;e
which &s;he could never hope to find in
this.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="121">
The report of Julia's di&s;appearance
&s;pread rapidly beyond the walls, and
&s;oon reached the ears of the marquis,
who rejoiced in the circum&s;tance, be|lieving
that &s;he mu&s;t now inevitably
fall into his hands.</P>
<P>After his people, in obedience to his
orders, had carefully &s;earched the &s;ur|rounding
woods and rocks, he with|drew
them from the abbey; and having
di&s;per&s;ed them various ways in &s;earch
of Julia, he returned to the ca&s;tle of
Mazzini. Here new vexation awaited
him, for he now fir&s;t learned that Fer|dinand
had e&s;caped from confinement.</P>
<P>The my&s;tery of Julia's flight was now
di&s;&s;olved; for it was evident by who&s;e
means &s;he had effected it, and the mar|quis
i&s;&s;ued orders to his people to &s;ecure
Ferdinand wherever he &s;hould be found.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>HIPPOLITUS, who had langui&s;hed
under a long and dangerous ill|ne&s;s
produced by his wounds, but
heightened and prolonged by the di&s;|tre&s;s
of his mind, was detained in a &s;mall
town on the coa&s;t of Calabria, and was
yet ignorant of the death of Cornelia.
He &s;carcely doubted that Julia was now
devoted to the duke, and this thought
was at times poi&s;on to his heart. After
his arrival in Calabria, immediately on
the recovery of his &s;en&s;es, he di&s;patch|ed
a &s;ervant back to the ca&s;tle of Maz|zini,
to gain &s;ecret intelligence of what
had pa&s;&s;ed after his departure. The
eagerne&s;s with which we endeavour to
e&s;cape from mi&s;ery, taught him to en|courage
a remote and romantic hope,
that Julia yet lived for him. Yet even
this hope at length langui&s;hed into de&s;|pair,
as the time elap&s;ed which &s;hould
<PB N="119" REF="123">
have brought his &s;ervant from Sicily.
Days and weeks pa&s;&s;ed away in the ut|mo&s;t
anxiety to Hippolitus, for &s;till his
emi&s;&s;ary did not appear; and at la&s;t, con|cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ing
that he had been either &s;eized
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">, or di&s;covered and detained
by the marquis, the count &s;ent off a
&s;econd emi&s;&s;ary to the ca&s;tle of Maz|zini.
By him he learned the news of
Julia's flight, and his heart dilated with
joy; but it was &s;uddenly checked, when
he heard the marquis had di&s;covered
her retreat in the abbey of St. Augu&s;tin.
The wounds which &s;till detained him in
confinement now became intolerable.
Julia might yet be lo&s;t to him for
ever. But even his pre&s;ent &s;tate of
fear and uncertainty was bli&s;s compared
with the angui&s;h of de&s;pair, which his
mind had long endured.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was &s;ufficiently recover|ed,
he quitted Italy for Sicily, in the
de&s;ign of vi&s;iting the mona&s;tery of St.
Augu&s;tin, where it was po&s;&s;ible Julia
<PB N="120" REF="124">
might yet remain. That he might pa&s;s
with the &s;ecrecy nece&s;&s;ary to his plan,
and e&s;cape the attacks of the marquis,
he left his &s;ervants in Calabria and em|barked
alone.</P>
<P>It was morning when he landed at a
&s;mall port of Sicily, and proceeded to|wards
the abbey of St. Augu&s;tin. As he
travelled, his imagination revolved the
&s;cenes of his early love, the di&s;tre&s;s of
Julia, and the &s;ufferings of Ferdinand,
and his heart melted at the retro&s;pect.
He con&s;idered the probabilities of Julia's
having found protection from her fa|ther
in the pity of the <HI>Padre Abate;</HI> and
even ventured to indulge him&s;elf in a
flattering, fond anticipation of the mo|ment,
when Julia &s;hould again be re&s;|tored
to his &s;ight.</P>
<P>He arrived at the mona&s;tery, and his
grief may ea&s;ily be imagined, when he
was informed of the death of his be|loved
&s;i&s;ter, and of the &s;light of Julia.
He quitted St. Augu&s;tin's immediately,
<PB N="121" REF="125">
without even knowing that Madame de
Menon was there, and &s;at out for a town
at &s;ome leagues di&s;tance, where he de|&s;igned
to pa&s;s the night.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbed in the melancholy reflec|tions
which the late intelligence ex|cited,
he gave the reins to his hor&s;e,
and journeyed on unmindful of his
way. The evening was far advanced,
when he di&s;covered that he had taken
a wrong direction, and that he was
bewildered in a wild and &s;olitary &s;cene.
He had wandered too far from the
road to hope to regain it, and he had
be&s;ide no recollection of the objects
left behind him. A choice of errors
only, lay before him. The view on his
right hand exhibited high and &s;avage
mountains, covered with heath and
black fir; and the wild de&s;olation of
their a&s;pect, together with the danger|ous
appearance of the path that wound
up their &s;ides, and which was the only
apparent track they afforded, determin|ed
Hippolitus not to attempt their a&s;|cent.
<PB N="122" REF="126">
On his left lay a fore&s;t, to which
the path he was then in led; its appear|ance
was gloomy, but he preferred it to
the mountains; and &s;ince he was uncer|tain
of its extent, there was a po&s;&s;ibility
that he might pa&s;s it, and reach a vil|lage
before the night was &s;et in.&mdash;At
the wor&s;t, the fore&s;t would afford him a
&s;helter from the winds; and however he
might be bewildered in its labyrinths, he
could a&s;cend a tree, and re&s;t in &s;ecurity
till the return of light &s;hould afford him
an opportunity of extricating him&s;elf.
Among the mountains there was no po&s;|&s;ibility
of meeting with other &s;helter
than what the habitation of man afford|ed,
and &s;uch a &s;helter there was little pro|bability
of finding. Innumerable dan|gers
al&s;o threatened him here, from which
he would be &s;ecure on level ground.</P>
<P>Having determined which way to
pur&s;ue, he pu&s;hed his hor&s;e into a gal|lop,
and entered the fore&s;t as the la&s;t
rays of the &s;un trembled on the moun|tains.
<PB N="123" REF="127">
The thick foliage of the trees
threw a gloom around, which was every
moment deepened by the &s;hades of even|ing.
The path was uninterrupted, and
the count continued to pur&s;ue it till all
di&s;tinction was confounded in the veil
of night. Total darkne&s;s now made it
impo&s;&s;ible for him to pur&s;ue his way.
He di&s;mounted, and fa&s;tening his hor&s;e
to a tree, climbed among the branches,
purpo&s;ing to remain there till morning.</P>
<P>He had not been long in this &s;ituation,
when a confu&s;ed &s;ound of voices from
a di&s;tance rou&s;ed his attention. The
&s;ound returned at intervals for &s;ome
time, but without &s;eeming to approach.
He de&s;cended from the tree, that he
might the better judge of the direction
whence it came; but before he reached
the ground, the noi&s;e was cea&s;ed, and
all was profoundly &s;ilent. He conti|nued
to li&s;ten, but the &s;ilence remaining
undi&s;turbed, he began to think he had
been deceived by the &s;inging of the
<PB N="124" REF="128">
wind among the leaves; and was prepar|ing
to re-a&s;cend, when he perceived a
faint light glimmer through the foliage
from afar. The &s;ight revived a hope
that he was near &s;ome place of human
habitation; he therefore unfa&s;tened his
hor&s;e, and led him towards the &s;pot
whence the ray i&s;&s;ued. The moon was
now ri&s;en, and threw a checkered gleam
over his path &s;ufficient to direct him.</P>
<P>Before he had proceeded far the light
di&s;appeared. He continued however his
way as nearly as he could gue&s;s, towards
the place whence it had i&s;&s;ued; and after
much toil, found him&s;elf in a &s;pot where
the trees formed a circle round a kind
of rude lawn. The moonlight di&s;cover|ed
to him an edifice which appeared to
have been formerly a mona&s;tery, but
which now exhibited a pile of ruins,
who&s;e grandeur, heightened by decay,
touched the beholder with reverential
awe. Hippolitus pau&s;ed to gaze upon
the &s;cene; the &s;acred &s;tillne&s;s of night
<PB N="125" REF="129">
encrea&s;ed its effect, and a &s;ecret dread,
he knew not wherefore, &s;tole upon his
heart.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence and the character of the
place made him doubt whether this was
the &s;pot he had been &s;eeking; and as he
&s;tood he&s;itating whether to proceed or
to return, he ob&s;erved a figure &s;tanding
under an arch-way of the ruin; it car|ried
a light in its hand, and pa&s;&s;ing
&s;ilently along, di&s;appeared in a remote
part of the building. The courage of
Hippolitus for a moment de&s;erted him.
An invincible curio&s;ity, however, &s;ub|dued
his terror, and he determined to
pur&s;ue, if po&s;&s;ible, the way the figure
had taken.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed over loo&s;e &s;tones through
a &s;ort of court, till he came to the
arch-way; here he &s;topped, for fear
returned upon him. Re&s;uming his
courage, however, he went on, &s;till en|deavouring
to follow the way the figure
had pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;uddenly found him&s;elf
in an enclo&s;ed part of the ruin, who&s;e ap|pearance
<PB N="126" REF="130">
was more wild and de&s;olate than
any he had yet &s;een. Seized with un|conquerable
apprehen&s;ion, he was re|tiring,
when the low voice of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
per&s;on &s;truck his ear. His heart &s;unk
at the &s;ound, his limbs trembled, and he
was utterly unable to move.</P>
<P>The &s;ound which appeared to be the
la&s;t groan of a dying per&s;on, was re|peated.
Hippolitus made a &s;trong ef|fort,
and &s;prang forward, when a light
bur&s;t upon him from a &s;hattered ca&s;e|ment
of the building, and at the &s;ame
in&s;tant he heard the voices of men!</P>
<P>He advanced &s;oftly to the window,
and beheld in a &s;mall room, which was
le&s;s decayed than the re&s;t of the edifice,
a group of men, who from the &s;avage|ne&s;s
of their looks, and from their dre&s;s,
appeared to be banditti. They &s;urround|ed
a man who lay on the ground wound|ed,
and bathed in blood, and who it
was very evident had uttered the groans
heard by the count.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="131">
The ob&s;curity of the place prevented
Hippolitus from di&s;tingui&s;hing the fea|tures
of the dying man. From the
blood which covered him, and from the
&s;urrounding circum&s;tances, he appeared
to be murdered; and the count had no
doubt that the men he beheld were the
murderers. The horror of the &s;cene
entirely overcame him; he &s;tood rooted
to the &s;pot, and &s;aw the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins rifle the
pockets of the dying per&s;on, who in a
voice &s;carcely articulate, but which de&s;|pair
&s;eemed to aid, &s;upplicated for mer|cy.
The ruffians an&s;wered him only
with execrations, and continued their
plunder. His groans and his &s;ufferings
&s;erved only to aggravate their cruelty.
They were proceeding to take from him
a miniature picture, which was fa&s;tened
round his neck, and had been hitherto
concealed in his bo&s;om; when by a &s;ud|den
effort he half rai&s;ed him&s;elf from
the ground, and attempted to &s;ave it
from their hands. The effort availed
<PB N="128" REF="132">
him nothing; a blow from one of the
villians laid the unfortunate man on the
floor without motion. The horrid bar|barity
of the act &s;eized the mind of
Hippolitus &s;o entirely, that forgetful of
his own &s;ituation, he groaned aloud,
and &s;tarted with an in&s;tantaneous de&s;ign
of avenging the deed. The noi&s;e he
made alarmed the banditti, who look|ing
whence it came, di&s;covered the
count through the ca&s;ement. They
in&s;tantly quitted their prize, and ru&s;hed
towards the door of the room. He was
now returned to a &s;en&s;e of his danger,
and endeavoured to e&s;cape to the exte|rior
part of the ruin; but terror bewil|dered
his &s;en&s;es, and he mi&s;took his
way. In&s;tead of regaining the arch|way,
he perplexed him&s;elf with fruitle&s;s
wanderings, and at length found him|&s;elf
only more deeply involved in the
&s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the pile.</P>
<P>The &s;teps of his pur&s;uers gained fa&s;t
upon him, and he continued to perplex
<PB N="129" REF="133">
him&s;elf with vain efforts at e&s;cape, till
at length, quite exhau&s;ted, he &s;unk on
the ground, and endeavoured to re&s;ign
him&s;elf to his fate. He li&s;tened with a
kind of &s;tern de&s;pair, and was &s;urprized
to find all &s;ilent. On looking round,
he perceived by a ray of moon-light
which &s;treamed through a part of the
ruin from above, that he was in a &s;ort
of vault, which, from the &s;mall means
he had of judging, he thought was ex|ten&s;ive.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he remained for a
con&s;iderable time, ruminating on the
means of e&s;cape, yet &s;carcely believing
e&s;cape was po&s;&s;ible. If he continued
in the vault, he might continue there
only to be butchered; but by attempt|ing
to re&s;cue him&s;elf from the place he
was now in, he mu&s;t ru&s;h into the hands
of the banditti. Judging it, therefore,
the &s;afer way of the two to remain where
he was, he endeavoured to await his fate
with fortitude, when &s;uddenly the loud
<PB N="130" REF="134">
voices of the murderers bur&s;t upon his
ear, and he heard &s;teps advancing
quickly towards the &s;pot where he lay.</P>
<P>De&s;pair in&s;tantly renewed his vigour;
he &s;tarted from the ground, and throw|ing
round him a look of eager de&s;pera|tion,
his eye caught the glimp&s;e of a
&s;mall door, upon which the moon-beam
now fell. He made towards it, and
pa&s;&s;ed it ju&s;t as the light of a torch
gleamed upon the walls of the vault.</P>
<P>He groped his way along a winding
pa&s;&s;age, and at length came to a flight
of &s;teps. Notwith&s;tanding the dark|ne&s;s,
he reached the bottom in &s;afety.</P>
<P>He now for the fir&s;t time &s;topped to
li&s;ten&mdash;the &s;ounds of pur&s;uit were cea&s;|ed,
and all was &s;ilent! Continuing to
wander on in ineffectual endeavours to
e&s;cape, his hands at length touched cold
iron, and he quickly perceived it be|longed
to a door. The door however
was fa&s;tened, and re&s;i&s;ted all his efforts
to open it. He was giving up the at|tempt
<PB N="131" REF="135">
in de&s;pair, when a loud &s;cream
from within, followed by a dead and
heavy noi&s;e, rou&s;ed all his attention.
Silence en&s;ued. He li&s;tened for a con|&s;iderable
time at the door, his imagina|tion
filled with images of horror, and
expecting to hear the &s;ound repeated.
He &s;ought for a decayed part of the
door, through which he might di&s;cover
what was beyond; but he could find
none; and after waiting &s;ome time with|out
hearing any farther noi&s;e, he was
quitting the &s;pot, when in pa&s;&s;ing his
arm over the door, it &s;truck again&s;t
&s;omething hard. On examination he
perceived to his extreme &s;urprize that
the key was in the lock. For a mo|ment
he he&s;itated what to do; but curio|&s;ity
overcame other con&s;iderations, and
with a trembling hand he turned the
key. The door opened into a large and
de&s;olate apartment, dimly lighted by a
lamp that &s;tood on a table, which
was almo&s;t the only furniture of the
<PB N="132" REF="136">
place. The count had advanced &s;eve|ral
&s;teps before he perceived an object,
which fixed all his attention. This
was the figure of a young woman lying
on the floor apparently dead. Her face
was concealed in her robe; and the long
auburn tre&s;&s;es which fell in beautiful
luxuriance over her bo&s;om, &s;erved to
veil a part of the glowing beauty which
the di&s;order of her dre&s;s would have
revealed.</P>
<P>Pity, &s;urprize, and admiration &s;trug|gled
in the brea&s;t of Hippolitus; and
while he &s;tood &s;urveying the object
which excited the&s;e different emo|tions,
he heard a &s;tep advancing to|wards
the room. He flew to the door
by which he had entered, and was for|tunate
enough to reach it before the en|trance
of the per&s;ons who&s;e &s;teps he
heard. Having turned the key, he
&s;topped at the door to li&s;ten to their pro|ceedings.
He di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices
of two men, and knew them to be
<PB N="133" REF="137">
tho&s;e of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. Pre&s;ently he
heard a piercing &s;hriek, and at the &s;ame
in&s;tant the voices of the ruffians grew
loud and violent. One of them ex|claimed
that the lady was dying, and
accu&s;ed the other of having frightened
her to death, &s;wearing with horrid im|precations
that &s;he was his, and he would
defend her to the la&s;t drop of his blood.
The di&s;pute grew higher; and neither
of the ruffians would give up his claim
to the unfortunate object of their alter|cation.</P>
<P>The cla&s;hing of &s;words was &s;oon after
heard, together with a violent noi&s;e.
The &s;creams were repeated, and the
oaths and execrations of the di&s;putants
redoubled. They &s;eemed to move to|wards
the door, behind which Hippolitus
was concealed; &s;uddenly the door was
&s;hook with great force, a deep groan fol|lowed,
and was in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded by a
noi&s;e like that of a per&s;on who&s;e whole
weight falls at once to the ground.
<PB N="134" REF="138">
For a moment all was &s;ilent. Hippoli|tus
had no doubt that one of the ruffians
had de&s;troyed the other, and was &s;oon
confirmed in the belief&mdash;for the &s;urvi|vor
triumphed with brutal exultation
over his fallen antagoni&s;t. The ruffian
ha&s;tily quitted the room, and Hippolitus
&s;oon after heard the di&s;tant voices of &s;eve|ral
per&s;ons in loud di&s;pute. The &s;ounds
&s;eemed to come from a chamber over
the place where he &s;tood; he al&s;o heard
a trampling of feet from above, and
could even di&s;tingui&s;h, at intervals, the
words of the di&s;putants. From the&s;e
he gathered enough to learn that the
affray which had ju&s;t happened, and the
lady who had been the occa&s;ion of it,
were the &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e. The
voices frequently ro&s;e together, and
confounded all di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>At length the tumult began to &s;ub|&s;ide,
and Hippolitus could di&s;tingui&s;h
what was &s;aid. The ruffians agreed to
give up the lady in que&s;tion to him who
<PB N="135" REF="139">
had fought for her; and leaving him to
his prize, they all went out in que&s;t of
farther prey. The &s;ituation of the un|fortunate
lady excited a mixture of pity
and indignation in Hippolitus, which
for &s;ome time entirely occupied him;
he revolved the means of extricating
her from &s;o deplorable a &s;ituation, and
in the&s;e thoughts almo&s;t forgot his own
danger. He now heard her &s;ighs; and
while his heart melted to the &s;ounds, the
farther door of the apartment was thrown
open, and the wretch to whom &s;he had
been allotted, ru&s;hed in. Her &s;creams
now redoubled, but they were of no
avail with the ruffian who had &s;eized
her in his arms; when the count, who
was unarmed, in&s;en&s;ible to every im|pul&s;e
but that of a generous pity, bur&s;t
into the room, but became fixed like a
&s;tatue when he beheld his Julia &s;trug|gling
in the gra&s;p of the ruffian. On
di&s;covering Hippolitus, &s;he made a &s;ud|den
&s;pring, and liberated her&s;elf; when,
<PB N="136" REF="140">
running to him, &s;he &s;unk lifele&s;s in his
arms.</P>
<P>Surprize and fury &s;parkled in the eyes
of the ruffian, and he turned with a &s;a|vage
de&s;peration upon the count; who,
relinqui&s;hing Julia, &s;natched up the
&s;word of the dead ruffian, which lay
upon the floor, and defended him&s;elf.
The combat was furious, but Hippoli|tus
laid his antagoni&s;t &s;en&s;el&s;s at his
feet. He flew to Julia, who now re|vived,
but who for &s;ome time could
&s;peak only by her tears. The tran&s;iti|ons
of various and rapid &s;en&s;ations,
which her heart experienced, and the
&s;trangely mingled emotions of joy and
terror that agitated Hippolitus, can only
be under&s;tood by experience. He rai&s;|ed
her from the floor, and endeavoured
to &s;oothe her to compo&s;ure, when &s;he
called wildly upon Ferdinand. At his
name the count &s;tarted, and in&s;tantly
remembered the dying cavalier, who&s;e
countenance the glooms had concealed
<PB N="137" REF="141">
from his view. His heart thrilled with
&s;ecret agony, yet he re&s;olved to with|hold
his terrible conjectures from Julia,
of whom he learned that Ferdinand,
with her&s;elf, had been taken by banditti
in the way from the villa which had
offered them &s;o ho&s;pitable a reception
after the &s;hip-wreck. They were on
the road to a port whence they de&s;igned
again to embark for Italy, when this
misfortune overtook them. Julia add|ed
that Ferdinand had been immediately
&s;eparated from her; and that, for &s;ome
hours, &s;he had been confined in the
apartment where Hippolitus found her.</P>
<P>The count with difficulty concealed
his terrible apprehen&s;ions for Ferdi|nand,
and vainly &s;trove to &s;often Julia's
di&s;tre&s;s. But there was no time to be
lo&s;t&mdash;they had yet to find a way out
of the edifice, and before they could
accompli&s;h this, the banditti might re|turn.
It was al&s;o po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of
the party were left to watch this their
<PB N="138" REF="142">
abode during the ab&s;ence of the re&s;t,
and this was another circum&s;tance of
rea&s;onable alarm.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little con&s;ideration, Hip|politus
judged it mo&s;t prudent to &s;eek
an outlet through the pa&s;&s;age by which
he entered; he therefore took the lamp,
and led Julia to the door. They enter|ed
the avenue, and locking the door
after them, &s;ought the flight of &s;teps
down which the count had before
pa&s;&s;ed; but having pur&s;ued the wind|ings
of the avenue a con&s;iderable time
without finding them, he became cer|tain
he had mi&s;taken the way. They,
however, found another flight, which
they de&s;cended, and entered upon a pa&s;|&s;age
&s;o very narrow and low, as not to
admit of a per&s;on walking upright.
This pa&s;&s;age was clo&s;ed by a door,
which on examination was found to be
chiefly of iron. Hippolitus was &s;tartled
at the &s;ight, but on applying his &s;trength
found it gradually yield, when the im|pri&s;oned
<PB N="139" REF="143">
air ru&s;hed out, and had nearly
extingui&s;hed the light. They now en|tered
upon a dark aby&s;s; and the door
which moved upon a &s;pring, &s;uddenly
clo&s;ed upon them. On looking around
they beheld a large vault; and it is not
ea&s;y to imagine their horror on di&s;cover|ing
they were in a receptacle for the
murdered bodies of the unfortunate
people who had fallen into the hands of
the banditti.</P>
<P>The count could &s;carcely &s;upport the
fainting &s;pirits of Julia; he ran to the
door which he endeavoured to open, but
the lock was &s;o con&s;tructed that it could
be moved only on the other &s;ide, and
all his efforts were u&s;ele&s;s. He was
con&s;trained, therefore, to &s;eek for ano|ther
door, but could find none. Their
&s;ituation was the mo&s;t deplorable that
can be imagined; for they were now
inclo&s;ed in a vault &s;trewn with the dead
bodies of the murdered, and mu&s;t there
become the victims of famine, or of the
&s;word. The earth was in &s;everal places
<PB N="140" REF="144">
thrown up, and marked the boundaries
of new made graves. The bodies which
remained unburied were probably left
either from hurry or negligence, and ex|hibited
a &s;pectacle too &s;hocking for
humanity. The &s;ufferings of Hippo|litus
were increa&s;ed by tho&s;e of Julia,
who was &s;inking with horror, and who
he endeavoured to &s;upport to a part of
the vault which fell into a rece&s;s&mdash;where
&s;tood a bench.</P>
<P>They had not been long in this &s;itua|tion,
when they heard a noi&s;e which
approached gradually, and which did
not appear to come from the avenue
they had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e increa&s;ed, and they could
di&s;tingui&s;h voices. Hippolitus believed
the murderers were returned; that they
had traced his retreat, and were coming
towards the vault by &s;ome way un|known
to him. He prepared for the
wor&s;t&mdash;and drawing his &s;word, re&s;olved
to defend Julia to the la&s;t. Their ap|prehen&s;ion,
<PB N="141" REF="145">
however, was &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated
by a trampling of hor&s;es, which &s;ound
had occa&s;ioned his alarm, and which
now &s;eemed to come from a court-yard
above, extremely near the vault. He
di&s;tinctly heard the voices of the ban|ditti,
together with the moans and &s;up|plications
of &s;ome per&s;on, whom it was
evident they were about to plunder.
The &s;ound appeared &s;o very near, that
Hippolitus was both &s;hocked and &s;ur|prized;
and looking round the vault,
he perceived a &s;mall grated window
placed very high in the wall, which he
concluded overlooked the place where
the robbers were a&s;&s;embled. He recol|lected
that his light might betray him;
and horrible as was the alternative,
he was compelled to extingui&s;h it. He
now attempted to climb to the grate,
through which he might obtain a view
of what was pa&s;&s;ing without. This at
length he effected, for the ruggedne&s;s of
the wall afforded him a footing. He
<PB N="142" REF="146">
beheld in a ruinous court, which was
partially illuminated by the glare of
torches, a group of banditti &s;urrounding
two per&s;ons who were bound on hor&s;e|back,
and who were &s;upplicating for
mercy.</P>
<P>One of the robbers exclaiming with
an oath that this was a golden night,
bade his comrades di&s;patch, adding he
would go to find Paulo and the lady.</P>
<P>The effect which the latter part of
this &s;entence had upon the pri&s;oners in
the vault, may be more ea&s;ily imagined
than de&s;cribed. They were now in to|tal
darkne&s;s in this man&s;ion of the mur|dered,
without means of e&s;cape, and in
momentary expectation of &s;haring a fate
&s;imilar to that of the wretched objects
around them. Julia overcome with di&s;|tre&s;s
and terror, &s;unk on the ground;
and Hippolitus, de&s;cending from the
grate, became in&s;en&s;ible of his own
danger in his apprehen&s;ion for her.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time all without was confu|&s;ion
<PB N="143" REF="147">
and uproar; the ruffian who had
left the court returned with the alarm
that the lady was fled, and that Paulo
was murdered. The robbers quitting
their booty to go in &s;earch of the fugi|tive;
and to di&s;cover the murderer,
dreadful vociferations re&s;ounded through
every rece&s;s of the pile.</P>
<P>The tumult had continued a con&s;ider|able
time, which the pri&s;oners had
pa&s;&s;ed in a &s;tate of horrible &s;u&s;pence,
when they heard the uproar advancing
towards the vault, and &s;oon after a num|ber
of voices &s;houted down the avenue.
The &s;ound of &s;teps quickened. Hip|politus
again drew his &s;word, and placed
him&s;elf oppo&s;ite the entrance, where he
had not &s;tood along, when a violent
pu&s;h was made again&s;t the door; it
flew open, and a party of men ru&s;hed
into the vault.</P>
<P>Hippolitus kept his po&s;ition, prote&s;t|ing
he would de&s;troy the fir&s;t who ap|proached.
At the &s;ound of his voice
<PB N="144" REF="148">
they &s;topped; but pre&s;ently advancing,
commanded him in the king's name to
&s;urrender. He now di&s;covered what
his agitation had prevented him from
ob&s;erving &s;ooner, that the men before
him were not banditti, but the officers
of ju&s;tice. They had received informa|tion
of this haunt of villainy from the
&s;on of a Sicilian nobleman, who had
fallen into the hands of this banditti,
and had afterwards e&s;caped from their
power.</P>
<P>The officers came attended by a
guard, and were every way prepared to
pro&s;ecute a &s;trenuous &s;earch through
the&s;e horrible rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Hippolitus enquired for Ferdinand,
and they all quitted the vault in &s;earch
of him. In the court, to which they
now a&s;cended, the greater part of the
banditti were &s;ecured by a number of
the guard. The count accu&s;ed the
robbers of having &s;ecreted his friend,
whom he de&s;cribed, and demanded to
have liberated.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="149">
With one voice they denied the fact,
and were re&s;olute in per&s;i&s;ting that they
knew nothing of the per&s;on de&s;cribed.
This denial confirmed Hippolitus in
his former terrible &s;urmi&s;e; that the
dying cavalier whom he had &s;een, was
no other than Ferdinand, and he became
furious. He bade the officers pro&s;ecute
their &s;earch, who, leaving a guard over
the banditti they had &s;ecured, followed
him to the room where the late dread|ful
&s;cene had been acted.</P>
<P>The room was dark and empty, but
the traces of blood were vi&s;ible on the
floor; and Julia, though ignorant of the
particular apprehen&s;ion of Hippolitus,
almo&s;t &s;wooned at the &s;ight. On quit|ting
the room, they wandered for &s;ome
time among the ruins, without di&s;cover|ing
any thing extraordinary, till, in pa&s;|&s;ing
under the arch-way by which Hip|politus
had fir&s;t entered the ruins, their
foot&s;teps returned a deep &s;ound, which
convinced them that the ground be|neath
<PB N="146" REF="150">
was hollow. On clo&s;e examina|tion,
they perceived by the light of their
torch, a trap door, which with &s;ome
difficulty they lifted, and di&s;covered be|yond
a narrow flight of &s;teps. They all
de&s;cended into a low winding pa&s;&s;age,
where they had not been long, above,
when they heard a trampling of hor&s;es
and a loud and &s;udden uproar.</P>
<P>The officers apprehending that the
banditti had overcome the guard, ru&s;h|ed
back to the trap-door, which they
had &s;carcely lifted, when they heard a
cla&s;hing of &s;words, and a confu&s;ion of
unknown voices. Looking onward,
they beheld through the arch, in an in|ner
&s;ort of court, a large party of ban|ditti
who were ju&s;t arrived, re&s;cuing
their comrades, and contending furi|ou&s;ly
with the guard.</P>
<P>On ob&s;erving this, &s;everal of the
officers &s;prang forward to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of their friends; and the re&s;t, &s;ubdued
by cowardice, hurried down the &s;teps,
<PB N="147" REF="151">
letting the trap-door fall after them
with a thundering noi&s;e. They gave
notice to Hippolitus of what was pa&s;|&s;ing
above, who hurried Julia along the
pa&s;&s;age in &s;earch of &s;ome outlet or con|cealment.
They could find neither;
and had not long pur&s;ued the windings
of the way, when they heard the trap|door
lifted, and the &s;teps of per&s;ons
de&s;cending. De&s;pair gave &s;trength to
Julia, and winged her flight. But they
were now &s;topped by a door which
clo&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age, and the &s;ound of
di&s;tant voices murmured along the walls.</P>
<P>The door was fa&s;tened by &s;trong iron
bolts, which Hippolitus vainly endea|voured
to draw. The voices drew near.
After much labour and difficulty the bolts
yielded&mdash;the door unclo&s;ed&mdash;and light
dawned upon them through the mouth
of a cave, into which they now entered.
On quitting the cave they found them|&s;elves
in the fore&s;t, and in a &s;hort time
<PB N="148" REF="152">
reached the borders. They now ven|tured
to &s;top, and looking back per|ceived
no per&s;on in pur&s;uit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Julia had re&s;ted, they fol|lowed
the track before them,
and in a &s;hort time arrived at a village
where they obtained &s;ecurity and re|fre&s;hment.</P>
<P>But Julia, who&s;e mind was occupied
with dreadful anxiety concerning Fer|dinand,
became indifferent to all around
her. Even the pre&s;ence of Hippolitus,
which but lately would have rai&s;ed her
from mi&s;ery to joy, failed to &s;oothe her
di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;teady and noble attach|ment
of her brother had &s;unk deep in
her heart, and reflection only aggravat|ed
her affliction. Yet the banditti had
&s;teadily per&s;i&s;ted in affirming that he
was not concealed in their rece&s;&s;es; and
this circum&s;tance, which threw a deeper
&s;hade over the fears of Hippolitus, im|parted
a glimmering of hope to the
mind of Julia.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="154">
A more immediate intere&s;t at length
forced her mind from this &s;orrowful
&s;ubject. It was nece&s;&s;ary to determine
upon &s;ome line of conduct, for &s;he was
now in an unknown &s;pot, and ignorant
of any place of refuge. The count,
who trembled at the dangers which en|vironed
her, and at the probabilities he
&s;aw of her being torn from him for ever,
&s;uffered a con&s;ideration of them to over|come
the dangerous delicacy which at
this mournful period required his &s;i|lence.
He entreated her to de&s;troy the
po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eparation, by con&s;enting
to become his immediately. He urged
that a prie&s;t could be ea&s;ily procured
from a neighbouring convent, who would
confirm the bonds which had &s;o long
united their hearts, and who would
thus at once arre&s;t the de&s;tiny that &s;o
long had threatened his hopes.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al, though &s;imilar to the
one &s;he had before accepted; and though
the certain means of re&s;cuing her from
<PB N="151" REF="155">
the fate &s;he dreaded, &s;he now turned
from in &s;orrow and dejection. She
loved Hippolitus with a &s;teady and ten|der
affection, which was &s;till heightened
by the gratitude he claimed as her de|liverer;
but &s;he con&s;idered it a propha|nation
of the memory of that brother
who had &s;uffered &s;o much for her &s;ake,
to mingle joy with the grief which her
uncertainty concerning him occa&s;ioned.
She &s;oftened her refu&s;al with a tender
grace, that quickly di&s;&s;ipated the jea|lous
doubt ari&s;ing in the mind of Hip|politus,
and encrea&s;ed his fond admira|tion
of her character.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired to retire for a time to
&s;ome ob&s;cure convent, there to await
the i&s;&s;ue of the event, which at pre|&s;ent
involved her in perplexity and
&s;orrow.</P>
<P>Hippolitus &s;truggled with his feelings
and forbore to pre&s;s farther the &s;uit on
which his happine&s;s, and almo&s;t his
exi&s;tence now depended. He enquired
<PB N="152" REF="156">
at the village for a neighbouring con|vent,
and was told that there was none
within twelve leagues, but that near
the town of Palini, at about that di&s;|tance,
were two. He procured hor&s;es;
and leaving the officers to return to Pa|lermo
for a &s;tronger guard, he, accom|panied
by Julia, entered on the road to
Palini.</P>
<P>Julia was &s;ilent and thoughtful; Hip|politus
gradually &s;unk into the &s;ame
mood, and he often ca&s;t a cautious look
around as they travelled for &s;ome hours
along the foot of the mountains. They
&s;topped to dine under the &s;hade of
&s;ome beech trees; for, fearful of di&s;co|very,
Hippolitus had provided again&s;t
the nece&s;&s;ity of entering many inns.
Having fini&s;hed their repa&s;t, they pur|&s;ued
their journey; but Hippolitus now
began to doubt whether he was in the
right direction. Being de&s;titute, how|ever,
of the means of certainty upon
this point, he followed the road before
<PB N="153" REF="157">
him, which now wound up the &s;ide of
a &s;teep hill, whence they de&s;cended into
a rich valley, where the &s;hepherd's pipe
&s;ounded &s;weetly from afar among the
hills. The evening &s;un &s;hed a mild
and mellow lu&s;tre over the land&s;cape,
and &s;oftened each feature with a vermil
glow that would have in&s;pired a mind
le&s;s occupied than Julia's, with &s;en&s;a|tions
of congenial tranquillity.</P>
<P>The evening now clo&s;ed in; and as
they were doubtful of the road, and
found it would be impo&s;&s;ible to reach
Palini that night, they took the way to
a village, which they perceived at the
extremity of the valley.</P>
<P>They had proceeded about half a
mile, when they heard a &s;udden &s;hout
of voices echoed from among the hills
behind them; and looking back per|ceived
faintly through the du&s;k a party
of men on hor&s;eback making towards
them. As they drew nearer, the words
they &s;poke were di&s;tingui&s;hable, and
<PB N="154" REF="158">
Julia heard her own name &s;ounded.
Shocked at this circum&s;tance, &s;he had
now no doubt that &s;he was di&s;covered
by a party of her father's people, and
&s;he fled with Hippolitus along the val|ley.
The pur&s;uers, however, were
almo&s;t come up with them, when they
reached the mouth of a cavern, into
which &s;he ran for concealment. Hip|politus
drew his &s;word; and awaiting
his enemies, &s;tood to defend the en|trance.</P>
<P>In a few moments Julia heard the
cla&s;hing of &s;words. Her heart trem|bled
for Hippolitus; and &s;he was upon
the point of returning to re&s;ign her&s;elf
at once to the power of her enemies,
and thus avert the danger that threaten|ed
him, when &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the loud
voice of the duke.</P>
<P>She &s;hrunk involuntarily at the found,
and pur&s;uing the windings of the ca|vern,
fled into its inmo&s;t rece&s;fes. Here
&s;he had not been long when the voices
<PB N="155" REF="159">
&s;ounded through the cave, and drew
near. It was now evident that Hippo|litus
was conquered, and that her ene|mies
were in &s;earch of her. She threw
round a look of unutterable angui&s;h, and
perceived very near, by a &s;udden gleam
of torch-light a low and deep rece&s;s
in the rock. The light, which belonged
to her pur&s;uers, grew &s;tronger; and &s;he
entered the rock on her knees, for the
overhanging crags would not &s;uffer her
to pa&s;s otherwi&s;e; and having gone a
few yards, perceived that it was termi|nated
by a door. The door yielded to
her touch, and &s;he &s;uddenly found her|&s;elf
in a highly vaulted cavern, which
received a feeble light from the moon
beams that &s;treamed through an open|ing
in the rock above.</P>
<P>She clo&s;ed the door, and pau&s;ed to
li&s;ten. The voices grewl ouder, and
more di&s;tinct, and at la&s;t approached &s;o
near that &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed what was
&s;aid. Above the re&s;t &s;he heard the
<PB N="156" REF="160">
voice of the duke. "It is impo&s;&s;ible
&s;he can have quitted the cavern," &s;aid
he, "and I will not leave it till I have
found her. Seek to the left of that rock,
while I examine beyond this point."</P>
<P>The&s;e words were &s;ufficient for Julia;
&s;he fled from the door acro&s;s the cavern
before her, and having ran a con&s;iderable
way without coming to a termination,
&s;topped to breathe. All was now &s;till;
and as &s;he looked around, the gloomy
ob&s;curity of the place &s;truck upon her
fancy all its horrors. She imperfectly
&s;urveyed the va&s;tne&s;s of the cavern in
wild amazement, and feared that &s;he had
precipitated her&s;elf again into the power
of banditti, for whom alone this place
appeared a fit receptacle. Having li&s;|tened
a long time without hearing a re|turn
of voices, &s;he &s;ought to find the
door by which &s;he had entered, but the
gloom, and va&s;t extent of the cavern,
made the endeavour hopele&s;s, and the
attempt un&s;ucce&s;sful. Having wander|ed
<PB N="157" REF="161">
a con&s;iderable time through the void,
&s;he gave up the effort, endeavoured to re|&s;ign
her&s;elf to her fate, and to compo&s;e her
di&s;tracted thoughts. The remembrance
of her former wonderful e&s;cape in&s;pired
her with confidence in the mercy of
God. But Hippolitus and Ferdinand
were now both lo&s;t to her&mdash;lo&s;t, perhaps
for ever&mdash;and the uncertainty of their
fate gave force to fancy, and poignancy
to &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Towards morning grief yielded to
nature, and Julia &s;unk to repo&s;e. She
was awakened by the &s;un, who&s;e rays
darting, obliquely through the opening
in the rock, threw a partial light acro&s;s
the cavern. Her &s;en&s;es were yet bewil|dered
by &s;leep, and &s;he &s;tarted in af|fright
on beholding her &s;ituation; as re|collection
gradually &s;tole upon her mind,
her &s;orrows returned, and &s;he &s;ickened
at the fatal retro&s;pect.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e, and renewed her &s;earch for
an outlet. The light, imperfect as it
<PB N="158" REF="162">
was, now a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, and &s;he found a
door, which &s;he perceived was not the
one by which &s;he had entered. It was
firmly fa&s;tened; &s;he di&s;covered, how|ever,
the bolts and the lock that held
it, and at length unclo&s;ed the door. It
opened upon a dark pa&s;&s;age, which &s;he
entered.</P>
<P>She groped along the winding walls
for &s;ome time, when &s;he perceived the
way was ob&s;tructed. She now di&s;cover|ed
that a door interrupted her progre&s;s,
and &s;ought for the bolts which might
fa&s;ten it. The&s;e &s;he found; and &s;trength|ened
by de&s;peration forced them back.
The door opened, and &s;he beheld in a
&s;mall room, which received its feeble
light from a window above, the pale
and emaciated figure of a woman, &s;eated,
with half clo&s;ed eyes, in a kind of elbow
chair. On perceiving Julia, &s;he &s;tarted
from her &s;eat, and her countenance ex|pre&s;&s;ed
a wild &s;urprize. Her features,
which were worn by &s;orrow, &s;till re|tained
<PB N="159" REF="163">
the traces of beauty, and in her
air was a mild dignity that excited in
Julia an involuntary veneration.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed as if about to &s;peak, when
fixing her eyes earne&s;tly and &s;teadily
upon Julia, &s;he &s;tood for a moment in
eager gaze, and &s;uddenly exclaiming,
"My daughter!" fainted away.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hment of Julia would
&s;carcely &s;uffer her to a&s;&s;i&s;t the lady, who
lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor. A multitude
of &s;trange imperfect ideas ru&s;hed upon
her mind, and &s;he was lo&s;t in confu&s;ion
and perplexity; but as &s;he examined the
features of the &s;tranger, which were now
re-kindling into life, &s;he thought &s;he di&s;|covered
the re&s;embl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ce of Emilia!</P>
<P>The lady breathing a deep &s;igh, un|clo&s;ed
her eyes; &s;he rai&s;ed them to Ju|lia,
who hung over her in &s;peechle&s;s
a&s;toni&s;hment, and fixing them upon her
with a tender earne&s;t expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;they
filled with tears. She pre&s;&s;ed Julia to
her heart, and a few moments of ex|qui&s;ite,
<PB N="160" REF="164">
unutterable emotion followed.
When the lady grew more compo&s;ed,
"Thank heaven,!" &s;aid &s;he, "my
prayer is granted. I am permitted to
embrace one of my children before I die.
Tell me what brought you hither. Has
the marquis at la&s;t relented, and allowed
me once more to behold you, or has his
death di&s;&s;olved my wretched bondage?"</P>
<P>Truth now glimmered upon the mind
of Julia, but &s;o faintly, that in&s;tead of
enlightening, it &s;erved only to encrea&s;e
her perplexity.</P>
<P>"Is the marquis Mazzini living?"
continued the lady. The&s;e words were
not to be doubted; Julia threw her&s;elf
at the feet of her mother, and embrac|ing
her knees in an energy of joy, an|&s;wered
only in &s;obs.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s eagerly enquired
after her children. "Emilia is living," an|&s;wered
Julia, "but my dear brother&mdash;"
"Tell me,"  cried the marchione&s;s,
with quickne&s;s. An explanation en&s;u|ed.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="165">
When &s;he was informed concerning
Ferdinand, &s;he &s;ighed deeply, and rai&s;|ing
her eyes to heaven, endeavoured to
a&s;&s;ume a look of pious re&s;ignation; but
the &s;truggle of maternal feeling was vi|&s;ible
in her countenance, and almo&s;t
overcame her powers of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Julia gave a &s;hort account of the pre|ceding
adventures, and of her entrance
into the cavern; and found to her inex|pre&s;&s;ible
&s;uprize, that &s;he was now in a
&s;ubterranean abode belonging to the
&s;outhern buildings of the ca&s;tle of Maz|zini!
The marchione&s;s was beginning
her narrative, when a door was heard to
unlock above, and the &s;ound of a foot|&s;tep
followed.</P>
<P>"Fly!" cried the marchione&s;s, "&s;e|crete
your&s;elf if po&s;&s;ible, for the marquis
is coming." Julia's heart &s;unk at the&s;e
words; &s;he pau&s;ed not a moment, but
retired through the door by which &s;he
had entered. This &s;he had &s;carcely
done, when another door of the cell
<PB N="162" REF="166">
was unlocked, and &s;he heard the voice
of her father. Its founds thrilled her
with univer&s;al tremour; the dread of
di&s;covery &s;o &s;trongly operated upon her
mind, that &s;he &s;tood in momentary ex|pectation
of &s;eeing the door of the pa&s;|&s;age
unclo&s;ed by the marquis; and &s;he
was deprived of all power of &s;eeking re|fuge
in the cavern.</P>
<P>At length the marquis, who came
with food, quitted the cell, and re-lock|ed
the door, when Julia &s;tole forth from
her hiding place. The marchione&s;s
again embraced, and wept over her
daughter. The narrative of her &s;uffer|ings
upon which &s;he now entered, en|tirely
di&s;&s;ipated the my&s;tery which had
&s;o long enveloped the &s;outhern build|ings
of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"Oh! why," &s;aid the marchione&s;s,
"is it my ta&s;k to di&s;cover to my daugh|ter
the vices of her father? In relating
my &s;ufferings, I reveal his crimes! It is
now about fifteen years, as near as I can
<PB N="163" REF="167">
gue&s;s from the &s;mall means I have of
judging, &s;ince I entered this horrible
abode. My &s;orrows, alas! began not
here; they commenced at an earlier pe|riod.
But it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that
the pa&s;&s;ion whence originated all my
misfortunes, was di&s;covered by me long
before I experienced the more baleful
effect of its influence."</P>
<P>"Seven years had elap&s;ed &s;ince my
marriage, when the charms of Maria de
Vellorno, a young lady &s;ingularly beau|tiful,
in&s;pired the marquis with a pa&s;&s;ion
as violent as it was irregular. I ob&s;erv|ed
with deep and &s;ilent angui&s;h, the
cruel indifference of my lord towards
me, and the rapid progre&s;s of his pa&s;|&s;ion
for another. I &s;everely examined
my pa&s;t conduct, which I am thankful
to &s;ay pre&s;ented a retro&s;pect of only
blamele&s;s actions; and I endeavoured by
meek &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and tender a&s;&s;iduities,
to recall that affection which was, alas!
gone for ever. My meek &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="164" REF="168">
was con&s;idered as marks of a &s;ervile
and in&s;en&s;ible mind; and my tender
a&s;&s;iduities, to which his heart no longer
re&s;ponded, created only di&s;gu&s;t, and ex|alted
the proud &s;pirit it was meant to
conciliate."</P>
<P>"The &s;ecret grief which this change
occa&s;ioned, con&s;umed my &s;pirits, and
preyed upon my con&s;titution, till at
length a &s;evere illne&s;s threatened my
life. I beheld the approach of death
with a &s;teady eye, and even welcomed
it as the pa&s;s-port to tranquillity; but it
was de&s;tined that I &s;hould linger through
new &s;cenes of mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>"One day, which it appears was the
paroxy&s;m of my di&s;order, I &s;unk into a
&s;tate of total torpidity, in which I lay
for &s;everal hours. It is impo&s;&s;ible to
de&s;cribe my feelings, when, on recover|ing,
I found my&s;elf in this hedious
abode. For &s;ome time I doubted my
&s;en&s;es, and afterwards believed that I
had quitted this world for another; but
<PB N="165" REF="169">
I was not long &s;uffered to continue
in my error, the appearance of the mar|quis
bringing me to a perfect &s;en&s;e of
my &s;ituation."</P>
<P>"I now under&s;tood that I had been
conveyed by his direction to this rece&s;s
of horror, where it was his will I &s;hould
remain. My prayers, my &s;upplications
were ineffectual; the hardne&s;s of his
heart repelled my &s;orrows back upon
my&s;elf; and as no entreaties could pre|vail
upon him to inform me where I
was, or of his rea&s;on for placing me
here, I remained for many years igno|rant
of my vicinity to the ca&s;tle, and of
the motive for my confinement."</P>
<P>"From that fatal day, until very
lately, I &s;aw the marquis no more&mdash;but
was attended by a per&s;on who had been
for &s;ome years dependant upon his
bounty, and whom nece&s;&s;ity, united to
an in&s;en&s;ible heart, had doubtle&s;s in|duced
to accept this office. He gene|rally
brought me a week's provi&s;ions, at
<PB N="166" REF="170">
&s;tated intervals, and I remarked that
his vi&s;its were always in the night."</P>
<P>"Contrary to my expectation, or
my wi&s;h, nature did that for me which
medicine had refu&s;ed, and I recovered
as if to puni&s;h with di&s;appointment and
anxiety my cruel tyrant. I afterwards
learned, that in obedience to the mar|quis's
order, I had been carried to this &s;pot
by Vincent during the night, and that
I had been buried in effigy at a neigh|bouring
church, with all the pomp of
funeral honour due to my rank."</P>
<P>At the name of Vincent, Julia &s;tarted;
the doubtful words he had uttered on
his death bed were now explained&mdash;the
cloud of my&s;tery which had &s;o long in|volved
the &s;outhern buildings broke at
once away; and each particular circum|&s;tance
that had excited her former ter|ror
aro&s;e to her view entirely unveiled
by the words of the marchione&s;s.&mdash;The
long and total de&s;ertion of this part of
the: fabric&mdash;the light that had appeared
<PB N="167" REF="171">
through the ca&s;ement&mdash;the figure &s;he
had &s;een i&s;&s;ue from the tower&mdash;the mid|night
noi&s;es &s;he had heard&mdash;were cir|cum&s;tances
evidently dependant on the
impri&s;onment of the marchione&s;s; the
latter of which incidents were produced
either by Vincent, or the marquis, in
their attendance upon her.</P>
<P>When &s;he con&s;idered the long and
dreadful &s;ufferings of her mother, and
that &s;he had for many years lived &s;o
near her ignorant of her mi&s;ery, and
even of her exi&s;tence&mdash;&s;he was lo&s;t in
a&s;toni&s;hment and pity.</P>
<P>"My days," continued the mar|chione&s;s,
"pa&s;&s;ed in a dead uniformity,
more dreadful than the mo&s;t acute vici&s;|&s;itudes
of misfortune, and which would
certainly have &s;ubdued my rea&s;on, had
not tho&s;e firm principles of religious
faith, which I imbibed in early youth,
enabled me to with&s;tand the &s;till, but
forceful, pre&s;&s;ure of my calamity."</P>
<P>"The in&s;en&s;ible heart of Vincent at
<PB N="168" REF="172">
length began to &s;often by my misfortunes.
He brought me &s;everal articles of com|fort,
of which I had hitherto been def|titute,
and an&s;wered &s;ome que&s;tions I
put to him concerning my family. To
relea&s;e me from my pre&s;ent &s;ituation,
however his inclination might befriend
me, was not to be expected, &s;ince his life
would have paid the forfeiture of what
would be termed his duty."</P>
<P>"I now fir&s;t di&s;covered my vicinity
to the ca&s;tle. I learned al&s;o, that the
marquis had married Maria de Vellorno,
with whom he re&s;ided at Naples, but
that my daughters were left at Mazzini.
This la&s;t intelligence awakened in my
heart the throbs of warm maternal ten|derne&s;s,
and on my knees I &s;upplicated
to &s;ee them. So earne&s;tly I entreated,
and &s;o &s;olemnly I promi&s;ed to return
quietly to my pri&s;on, that at length,
prudence yielded to pity, and Vincent
con&s;ented to my reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"On the following day he came to
<PB N="169" REF="173">
the cell, and informed me my chil|dren
were going into the woods, and
that I might &s;ee them from a window
near which they would pa&s;s. My nerves
thrilled at the&s;e words, and I could
&s;carcely &s;upport my&s;elf to the &s;pot I &s;o
eagerly &s;ought. He led me through
long and intricate pa&s;&s;ages, as I gue&s;&s;ed
by the frequent turnings, for my eyes
were bound, till I reached a hall of
the &s;outh buildings. I followed to a
room above, where the full light of
day once more bur&s;t upon my &s;ight, and
almo&s;t overpowered me. Vincent plac|ed
me by a window, which looked to|wards
the woods. Oh! what moments
of painful impatience were tho&s;e in
which I awaited your arrival!"</P>
<P>"At length you appeared. I &s;aw
you&mdash;I &s;aw my children&mdash;and was nei|ther
permitted to cla&s;p them to my
heart, or to &s;peak to them! You was
leaning on the arm of your &s;i&s;ter, and
your countenances &s;poke the &s;prightly
<PB N="170" REF="174">
happy innocence of youth&mdash;Alas! you
knew not the wretched fate of your mo|ther,
who then gazed upon you! Al|though
you were at too great a di&s;tance
for my weak voice to reach you, with
the utmo&s;t difficulty I avoided throwing
open the window, and endeavouring to
di&s;cover my&s;elf. The remembrance of
my &s;olemn promi&s;e, and that the life of
Vincent would be &s;acrificed by the act,
alone re&s;trained me. I &s;truggled for
&s;ome time with emotions too powerful
for my nature, and fainted away."</P>
<P>"On recovering I called wildly for
my children, and went to the window&mdash;but
you were gone! Not all the en|treaties
of Vincent could for &s;ome time
remove me from this &s;tation, where I
waited in the fond expectation of &s;eeing
you again&mdash;but you appeared no more!
At la&s;t I returned to my cell in an exta&s;y
of grief which I tremble even to remem|ber."</P>
<P>"This interview, &s;o eagerly &s;ought,
and &s;o reluctantly granted, proved a
<PB N="171" REF="175">
&s;ource of new mi&s;ery&mdash;in&s;tead of
calming, it agitated my mind with a
re&s;tle&s;s wild de&s;pair, which bore away
my &s;tronge&s;t powers of re&s;i&s;tance. I
raved ince&s;&s;antly of my children, and
ince&s;&s;antly &s;olicited to &s;ee them again&mdash;Vincent,
however, had found but too
much cau&s;e to repent of his fir&s;t indul|gence,
to grant me a &s;econd."</P>
<P>"About this time a circum&s;tance
occurred which promi&s;ed me a &s;peedy
relea&s;e from calamity. Above a week
elap&s;ed, and Vincent did not appear.
My little &s;tock of provi&s;ion was exhau&s;t|ed,
and I had been two days without
food, when I again heard the doors that
led to my pri&s;on crack on their hinges.
An unknown &s;tep approached, and in a
few minutes the marquis entered my
cell! My blood was chilled at the &s;ight,
and I clo&s;ed my eyes as I hoped for the
la&s;t time. The &s;ound of his voice re|called
me. His countenance was dark
and &s;ullen, and I perceived that he
<PB N="172" REF="176">
trembled. He informed me that Vincent
was no more, and that henceforward his
office he &s;hould take upon him&s;elf. I for|bore
to reproach&mdash;where reproach would
only have produced new &s;ufferings, and
with-held &s;upplication where it would
have exa&s;perated con&s;cience and in|flamed
revenge. My knowledge of
the marquis's &s;econd marriage I con|cealed."</P>
<P>"He u&s;ually attended me when
night might be&s;t conceal his vi&s;its;
though the&s;e were irregular in their re|turn.
Lately, from what motive I can
not gue&s;s, he has cea&s;ed his nocturnal
vi&s;its, and comes only in the day."</P>
<P>"Once when midnight encrea&s;ed the
darkne&s;s of my pri&s;on, and &s;eemed to
render &s;ilence even more awful, touched
by the &s;acred horrors of the hour, I
poured forth my di&s;tre&s;s in loud lamen|tation.
Oh! never can I forget what I
felt, when I heard a di&s;tant voice an&s;wer
to my moan! A wild &s;uprize, which
<PB N="173" REF="177">
was &s;trangely mingled with hope, &s;eiz|ed
me, and in my fir&s;t emotion I &s;hould
have an&s;wered the call, had not a recol|lection
cro&s;&s;ed me, which bla&s;ted at once
every half-rai&s;ed &s;en&s;ation of joy. I
remembered, the dreadful vengeance
which the marquis had &s;worn to execute
upon me if I ever, by any means, endea|voured
to make known the place of my
concealment; and though life had long
been a burden to me, I dared not to in|cur
the certainty of being murdered.
I al&s;o well knew that no per&s;on who
might di&s;cover my &s;ituation could effect
my enlargement; for I had no relations
to deliver me by force, and the marquis,
you know, has not only power to im|pri&s;on,
but al&s;o the right of life and
death in his own domains. I, therefore,
forbore to an&s;wer the call, though I
could not entirely repre&s;s my lamenta|tion.
I long perplexed my&s;elf with en|deavouring
to account for this &s;trange
circum&s;tance, and am to this moment
ignorant of its cau&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="178">
Julia remembering that Ferdinand
had been confined in a dungeon of the
ca&s;tle, it in&s;tantly occurred to her that
his pri&s;on, and that of the marchione&s;s,
were not far di&s;tant; and &s;he &s;crupled
not to believe that it was his voice which
her mother had heard. She was right
in this belief, and it was indeed the
marchione&s;s who&s;e groans had formerly
cau&s;ed Ferdinand &s;o much alarm, both
in the marble hall of the &s;outh build|ings,
and in his dungeon.</P>
<P>When Julia communicated her opini|on,
and the marchione&s;s believed that
&s;he had heard the voice of her
&s;on&mdash;her emotion was extreme, and it was &s;ome
time before &s;he could re&s;ume her narra|tion.</P>
<P>"A &s;hort time &s;ince," continued the
marchione&s;s, "the marquis brought me
a fortnight's provi&s;ion, and told me that
I &s;hould probably &s;ee him no more till
the expiration of that term. His ab|&s;ence
at this period you have explained
<PB N="175" REF="179">
in your account of the tran&s;actions
at the abbey of St. Augu&s;tin. How can
I ever &s;ufficiently acknowledge the ob|ligations
I owe to my dear and invalua|ble
friend Madame de Menon! Oh!
that it might be permitted me to te&s;tify
my gratitude."</P>
<P>Julia attended to the narrative of her
mother in &s;ilent a&s;tonishment, and gave
all the &s;ympathy which &s;orrow could
demand. "Surely" cried &s;he, "the pro|vidence
on whom you have &s;o firmly re|lied,
and who&s;e inflictions you have &s;up|ported
with a fortitude &s;o noble, has con|ducted
me through a labyrinth of mi&s;|fortunes
to this &s;pot, for the purpo&s;e of
delivering you! Oh! let us ha&s;ten to fly
this horrid abode&mdash;let us &s;eek to e&s;cape
through the cavern by which I entered."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, in earne&s;t expectation
awaiting a reply. "Whither can I
fly?" &s;aid the marchione&s;s, deeply &s;igh|ing.
This que&s;tion &s;poken with the
empha&s;is of de&s;pair, affected Julia to
tears, and &s;he was for a while &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="180">
"The marquis," re&s;umed Julia,
"would know not where to &s;eek you, or
if he found you beyond his own domains,
would fear to claim you. A con|vent
may afford for the pre&s;ent a &s;afe
a&s;ylum; and whatever &s;hall happen,
&s;urely no fate you may hereafter encoun|ter
can be more dreadful than the one
you now experience."</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s a&s;&s;ented to the truth
of this, yet her broken &s;pirits, the effect
of long &s;orrow and confinement, made
her he&s;itate how to act; and there was
a kind of placid de&s;pair in her look,
which too faithfully depictured her feel|ings.
It was obvious to Julia that the
cavern &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed wound beneath
the range of mountains on who&s;e oppo|&s;ite
&s;ide &s;tood the ca&s;tle of Mazzini.
The hills thus ri&s;ing, formed a &s;creen
which mu&s;t entirely conceal their emer|gence
from the mouth of the cave, and
their flight, from tho&s;e in the ca&s;tle.
She repre&s;ented the&s;e circum&s;tances to
<PB N="177" REF="181">
her mother, and urged them &s;o forcibly,
that the lethargy of de&s;pair yielded to
hope, and the marchione&s;s committed,
her&s;elf to the conduct of her daughter.</P>
<P>"Oh! let me lead you to light and
life!"cried Julia with warm enthu&s;ia&s;m.
"Surely heaven can ble&s;s me with no
greater good than by making me the
deliverer of my mother." They both,
knelt down; and the marchione&s;s with
that affecting, eloquence which true piety
in&s;pires, and with that confidence
which had &s;upported her through &s;o
many mi&s;eries, committed her&s;elf to the
protection of God, and implored his
favour on their attempt.</P>
<P>They aro&s;e, but as they conver&s;ed
farther on their plan, Julia recollected
that &s;he was de&s;titute of money&mdash;the
banditti having robbed her of all! The
&s;udden &s;hock produced by this remem|brance
almo&s;t &s;ubdued her &s;pirits;
never till this moment had &s;he under|&s;tood
the value of money. But &s;he
<PB N="178" REF="182">
commanded her feelings, and re&s;olved
to conceal this circum&s;tance from the
marchione&s;s, preferring the chance of
any evil they might encounter from
without, to the certain mi&s;ery of this
terrible impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Having taken what provi&s;ion the
marquis had brought, they quitted the
cell, and entered upon the dark pa&s;&s;age,
along which they pa&s;&s;ed with cautious
&s;teps. Julia came fir&s;t to the door of
the cavern, but who can paint her di&s;|tre&s;s
when &s;he found it was fa&s;tened!
All her efforts to open it were ineffectual.&mdash;The
door which had clo&s;ed after her,
was held by a &s;pring lock, and could
be opened on this &s;ide only with a key.
When &s;he under&s;tood this circum&s;tance,
the marchione&s;s, with a placid re&s;igna|tion
which &s;eemed to exalt her above
humanity, addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf again to
heaven, and turned back to her cell.
Here Julia indulged without re&s;erve,
and without &s;cruple, the exce&s;s of her
grief. The marchione&s;s wept over her.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="183">
"Not for my&s;elf," &s;aid &s;he, "do I grieve,&mdash;I
have too long been inured to mi&s;|fortune
to &s;ink under its pre&s;&s;ure. This
di&s;appointment is intrin&s;ically, perhaps,
little&mdash;for I had no certain refuge
from calamity&mdash;and had it even been
otherwi&s;e, a few years only of &s;uffering
would have been &s;pared me. It is for
you, Julia, who &s;o much lament my
fate; and who, in being thus delivered
to the power of your father, are &s;acri|ficed
to the duke de Luovo&mdash;that my
heart &s;wells."</P>
<P>Julia could make no reply, but by
pre&s;&s;ing to her lips the hand which
was held forth to her. She &s;aw all the
wretchedne&s;s of her &s;ituation; and her
fearful uncertainty concerning Hippo|litus
and Ferdinand, formed no inferior
part of her affliction.</P>
<P>"If," re&s;umed the marchione&s;s,
"you prefer impri&s;onment with your
mother, to a marriage with the duke,
you may &s;till &s;ecrete your&s;elf in the pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="180" REF="184">
we have ju&s;t quitted, and &s;hare the
provi&s;ion which is brought me."</P>
<P>"O! talk not, madam, of a mar|riage
with the duke," &s;aid Julia; "&s;urely
any fate is preferable to that. But
when I con&s;ider that in remaining here, I
am condemned only to the &s;ufferings
which my mother has &s;o long endured,
and that this confinement will enable
me to &s;often, by tender &s;ympathy, the
a&s;perity of her misfortunes, I ought to
&s;ubmit to my pre&s;ent &s;ituation with
complacency, even did a marriage with
the duke appear le&s;s hateful to me."</P>
<P>"Excellent girl!" exclaimed the
marchione&s;s, cla&s;ping Julia to her bo|&s;om;
"the &s;ufferings you lament are
almo&s;t repaid by this proof of your good|ne&s;s
and affection!" Alas! that I &s;hould
have been &s;o long deprived of &s;uch a
daughter!</P>
<P>Julia now endeavoured to imitate the
fortitude of her mother, and tenderly
concealed her anxiety for Ferdinand
and Hippolitus, the idea of whom
<PB N="181" REF="185">
ince&s;&s;antly haunted her imagination.
When the marquis brought food to
the cell, &s;he retired to the avenue lead|ing
to the cavern, and e&s;caped di&s;|covery.</P>

<PB N="182" REF="186">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>THE marquis, meanwhile, who&s;e
indefatigable &s;earch after Julia
failed of &s;ucce&s;s, was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the
&s;lave of alternate pa&s;&s;ions, and he pour|ed
forth the &s;pleen of di&s;appointment on
his unhappy dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s, who may now more
properly be called Maria de Vellorno,
inflamed, by artful in&s;inuations, the pa&s;|&s;ions
already irritated, and heightened
with cruel triumph his re&s;entment to|wards
Julia and Madame de Menon.
She repre&s;ented, what his feelings too
acutely acknowledged,&mdash;that by the ob|&s;tinate
di&s;obedience of the fir&s;t, and the
machinations of the la&s;t, a prie&s;t had
been enabled to arre&s;t his authority
as a father&mdash;to in&s;ult the &s;acred honour
of his nobility&mdash;and to overturn at once
his proude&s;t &s;chemes of power and am|bition.
She declared it her opinion,
<PB N="183" REF="187">
that the <HI>Abate</HI> was acquainted with the
place of Julia's pre&s;ent retreat, and up|braided
the marquis with want of &s;pirit
in thus &s;ubmitting to be outwitted by a
prie&s;t, and forbearing an appeal to the
pope, who&s;e authority would compel the
<HI>Abate</HI> to re&s;tore Julia.</P>
<P>This reproach &s;tung the very &s;oul of
the marquis; he felt all its force, and
was at the &s;ame time con&s;cious of his
inability to obviate it. The effect of
his crimes now fell in &s;evere puni&s;hment
upon his own head. The threatened
&s;ecret, which was no other than the im|pri&s;onment
of the marchione&s;s, arre&s;ted
his arm of vengeance, and compelled
him to &s;ubmit to in&s;ult and di&s;appoint|ment.
But the reproach of Maria &s;unk
deep in his mind; it fomented his pride
into redoubled fury, and he now repell|ed
with di&s;dain the idea of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He revolved the means which might
effect his purpo&s;e&mdash;he &s;aw but one&mdash;this
was the death of the marchione&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="188">
The commi&s;&s;ion of one crime often
requires the perpetration of another.
When once we enter on the labyrinth of
vice, we can &s;eldom return, but are led
on through corre&s;pondent mazes to de&s;|truction.
To obviate the effect of his fir&s;t
crime, it was now nece&s;&s;ary the mar|quis
&s;hould commit a &s;econd, and con|ceal
the <HI>impri&s;onment</HI> of the marchione&s;s
by her <HI>murder.</HI> Him&s;elf the only liv|ing
witne&s;s of her exi&s;tence, when &s;he
was removed, the allegations of the
<HI>Padre Abate</HI> would by this means be
un&s;upported by any proof, and he might
then boldly appeal to the pope for the
re&s;toration of his child.</P>
<P>He mu&s;ed upon this &s;cheme, and the
more he accu&s;tomed his mind to con|template
it, the le&s;s &s;crupulous he be|came.
The crime from which he would
formerly have &s;hrunk, he now &s;urveyed
with a &s;teady eye. The fury of his
pa&s;&s;ions, unaccu&s;tomed to re&s;i&s;tance,
uniting with the force of what ambition
<PB N="185" REF="189">
termed nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;urged him to the
deed, and he determined upon the mur|der
of his wife. The means of effecting
his purpo&s;e were ea&s;y and various; but
as he was not yet &s;o entirely hardened
as to be able to view her dying pangs,
and embrue his own hands in her blood,
he cho&s;e to di&s;patch her by means of
pri&s;on, which he re&s;olved to mingle in
her food.</P>
<P>But a new affliction was preparing
for the marquis, which attacked him
where he was mo&s;t vulnerable; and the
veil which had &s;o long over&s;hadowed his
rea&s;on was now to be removed. He was
informed by Bapti&s;ta of the infidelity of
Maria de Vellorno. In the fir&s;t emotion
of pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;purned the informer from
his pre&s;ence, and di&s;dained to believe
the circum&s;tance. A little reflection
changed the object of his re&s;entment;
he recalled the &s;ervant, who&s;e faithful|ne&s;s
he had no rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t, and
conde&s;cended to interrogate him on the
&s;ubject of his misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="190">
He learned that an intimacy had for
&s;ome time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Maria and
the cavalier de Vincini; and that the
a&s;&s;ignation was u&s;ually held at the pa|villion
on the &s;ea &s;hore, in an evening.
Bapti&s;ta farther declared, that if the mar|quis
de&s;ired a confirmation of his words,
he might obtain it by vi&s;iting this &s;pot
at the hour mentioned.</P>
<P>This information lighted up the wild|e&s;t
pa&s;&s;ions of his nature; his former
&s;ufferings faded away before the &s;tronger
influence of the pre&s;ent misfortune, and
it &s;eemed as if he had never ta&s;ted mi|&s;ery
till now. To &s;u&s;pect the wife upon
whom he doated with romantic fondne&s;s,
on whom he had centered all his firme&s;t
hopes of happine&s;s, and for who&s;e &s;ake
he had committed the crime which em|bittered
even his pre&s;ent moments, and
which would involve him in &s;till deeper
guilt&mdash;to find <HI>her</HI> ungrateful to his love,
and a traitore&s;s to his honour&mdash;produc|ed
a mi&s;ery more poignant than any his
<PB N="187" REF="191">
imagination had conceived. He was
torn by contending pa&s;&s;ions, and oppo|&s;ite
re&s;olutions:&mdash;now he re&s;olved to
expiate her guilt with her blood&mdash;and
now he melted in all the &s;oftne&s;s of love.
Vengeance and honour bade him &s;trike
to the heart which had betrayed him,
and urged him in&s;tantly to the deed&mdash;when
the idea of her beauty&mdash;her win|ning
&s;miles&mdash;her fond endearments &s;tole
upon his fancy, and &s;ubdued his heart;
he almo&s;t wept to the idea of injuring
her, and in &s;pight of appearances, pro|nounced
her faithful. The &s;ucceeding
moment plunged him again in uncer|tainty;
his tortures acquired new vi|gour
from ce&s;&s;ation, and again he ex|perienced
all the phrenzy of de&s;pair.
He was now re&s;olved to end his doubts
by repairing to the pavillion; but again
his heart wavered in irre&s;olution how to
proceed &s;hould his fears be confirmed.
In the mean time he determined to
watch the behaviour of Maria with &s;e|vere
vigilance.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="192">
They met at dinner, and he ob&s;erved
her clo&s;ely, but di&s;covered not the &s;mall|e&s;t
impropriety in her conduct. Her
&s;miles and her beauty again wound their
fa&s;cinations round his heart, and in the
exce&s;s of their influence he was almo&s;t
tempted to repair the injury which his
late &s;u&s;picions had done her, by confe&s;|&s;ing
them at her feet. The appearance
of the cavalier de Vincini, however, re|newed
his &s;u&s;picions; his heart throbbed
wildly, and with re&s;tle&s;s impatience he
watched the return of evening, which
would remove his &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>Night at length came. He repaired to
the pavillion, and &s;ecreted him&s;elf
among the trees that embowered it.
Many minutes had not pa&s;&s;ed, when he
heard a &s;ound of low whi&s;pering voices
&s;teal from among the trees, and foot|&s;teps
approaching down the alley. He
&s;tood almo&s;t petrified with terrible &s;en|&s;ations,
and pre&s;ently heard &s;ome per|&s;ons
enter the pavillion. The marquis
<PB N="189" REF="193">
now emerged from his hiding place; a
faint light i&s;&s;ued from the building.
He &s;tole to the window, and beheld
within, Maria and the cavalier de Vin|cini.
Fired at the &s;ight, he drew his
&s;word, and &s;prang forward. The &s;ound
of his &s;tep alarmed the cavalier, who,
on perceiving the marquis, ru&s;hed by
him from the pavillion, and di&s;appear|ed
among the woods. The marquis
pur&s;ued, but could not overtake him;
and he returned to the pavillion with
an intention of plunging his &s;word in
the heart of Maria, when he di&s;covered
her &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the ground. Pity now
&s;u&s;pended his vengeance; he pau&s;ed in
agonizing gaze upon her, and returned
his &s;word into the &s;cabbard.</P>
<P>She revived, but on ob&s;erving the
marquis, &s;creamed and relap&s;ed. He
ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; in|venting,
to conceal his di&s;grace, &s;ome
pretence for her &s;udden illne&s;s, and &s;he
was conveyed to her chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="194">
The marquis was now not &s;uffered
to doubt her infidelity, but the pa&s;&s;ion
which her conduct abu&s;ed, her faith|le&s;sne&s;s
could not &s;ubdue; he &s;till
doated with ab&s;urd fondne&s;s, and even
regretted that uncertainty could no
longer flattered him with hope. It &s;eem|ed
as if his de&s;ire of her affection en|crea&s;ed
with his knowledge of the lo&s;s
of it; and the very circum&s;tance which
&s;hould have rou&s;ed his aver&s;ion, by a
&s;trange perver&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ition, appear|ed
to heighten his pa&s;&s;ion, and to make
him think it impo&s;&s;ible he could exi&s;t
without her.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t energy of his indig|nation
was &s;ub&s;ided, he determined,
therefore, to reprove and to puni&s;h, but
hereafter to re&s;tore her to favour.</P>
<P>In this re&s;olution he went to her
apartment, and reprehended her fal&s;e|hood
in terms of ju&s;t indignation.</P>
<P>Maria de Vellorno, in whom the late
di&s;covery had rou&s;ed re&s;entment, in&s;tead
<PB N="191" REF="195">
of awakening penitence; and exa&s;perat|ed
pride without exciting &s;hame,&mdash;heard
the upbraidings of the marquis
with impatience, and replied to them
with acrimonious violence.</P>
<P>She boldly a&s;&s;erted her innocence, and
in&s;tantly invented a &s;tory, the plau&s;ibi|lity
of which might have deceived a
man who had evidence le&s;s certain than
his &s;en&s;es to contradict it. She be|haved
with a haughtine&s;s the mo&s;t in|&s;olent;
and when &s;he perceived that the
marquis was no longer to be mi&s;led, and
that her violence failed to accompli&s;h
its purpo&s;e, &s;he had recour&s;e to tears and
&s;upplications. But the artifice was too
glaring to &s;ucceed; and the marquis
quitted her apartment in an agony of
re&s;entment.</P>
<P>His former fa&s;cinations, however,
quickly returned, and again held him
in &s;u&s;pen&s;ion between love and ven|geance.
That the vehemence of his
pa&s;&s;ion however, might not want an
<PB N="192" REF="196">
object, he ordered Bapti&s;ta to di&s;cover
the retreat of the cavalier de Vincini,
on whom he meant to revenge his lo&s;t
honour. Shame forbade him to employ
others in the &s;earch.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery &s;u&s;pended for a while
the operations of that fatal &s;cheme,
which had before employed the thoughts
of the marquis; but it had only &s;u&s;pend|ed&mdash;not
de&s;troyed them. The late oc|currence
had annihilated his dome&s;tic
happine&s;s; but his pride now ro&s;e to
re&s;cue him from de&s;pair, and he centered
all his future hopes upon ambition. In
a moment of cool reflection, he con|&s;idered
that he had derived neither hap|pine&s;s
nor content from the pur&s;uit of
di&s;&s;ipated plea&s;ures, to which he had
hitherto &s;acrificed every oppo&s;ing con|&s;ideration.
He re&s;olved, therefore, to
abandon the gay &s;chemes of di&s;&s;ipation
which had formerly allured him, and
dedicate him&s;elf entirely to ambition,
in the pur&s;uits and delights of which
<PB N="193" REF="197">
he hoped to bury all his cares. He
therefore became more earne&s;t than
ever for the marriage of Julia with the
duke de Luovo, through who&s;e means
he de&s;igned to involve him&s;elf in the in|tere&s;ts
of the &s;tate, and determined to re|cover
her at whatever con&s;equence. He
re&s;olved without further delay to ap|peal
to the pope; but to do this with
&s;afety, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the marchi|one&s;s
&s;hould die; and he returned there|fore
to the con&s;ideration and execution
of his diabolical purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He mingled a poi&s;onous drug with
the food he de&s;igned for her; and when
night arrived, carried it to the cell.
As he unlocked the door, his hand
trembled; and when he pre&s;ented the
food, and looked con&s;ciou&s;ly for the la&s;t
time upon the marchione&s;s, who re|ceived
it with humble thankfulne&s;s, his
heart almo&s;t relented. His countenance,
over which was diffu&s;ed the palene&s;s of
death, expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ecret movements
<PB N="194" REF="198">
of his &s;oul, and he gazed upon her with
eyes of &s;tiffened horror. Alarmed by
his looks, &s;he fell upon her knees to &s;up|plicate
his pity.</P>
<P>Her attitude recalled his bewildered
&s;en&s;es; and endeavouring to a&s;&s;ume a
tranquil a&s;pect, he bade her ri&s;e, and
in&s;tantly quitted the cell, fearful of the
in&s;tability of his purpo&s;e. His mind
was not yet &s;ufficiently hardened by
guilt to repel the arrows of con&s;cience,
and his imagination re&s;ponded to her
power. As he pa&s;&s;ed through the long
dreary pa&s;&s;ages from the pri&s;on, &s;olemn
and my&s;terious &s;ounds &s;eemed to &s;peak
in every murmur of the bla&s;t which
crept along their windings, and he often
&s;tarted and looked back.</P>
<P>He reached his chamber, and having
&s;hut the door, &s;urveyed the room in
fearful examination. Ideal forms flitted
before his fancy, and for the fir&s;t time
in his life he feared to be alone. Shame
only with-held him from calling Bap|ti&s;ta.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="199">
The gloom of the hour, and the
death-like &s;ilence that prevailed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
the horrors of his imagination. He half
repented of the deed, yet deemed it
now too late to obviate it; and he threw
him&s;elf on his bed in terrible emotion.
His head grew dizzy, and a &s;udden
faintne&s;s overcame him; he he&s;itated,
and at length aro&s;e to ring for a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
but found him&s;elf unable to &s;tand.</P>
<P>In a few moments he was &s;omewhat
revived, and rang his beil; but before
any per&s;on appeared, he was &s;eized with
terrible pains, and &s;taggering to his bed,
&s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon it. Here Bapti&s;ta,
who was the fir&s;t per&s;on that entered
his room, found him &s;truggling, &s;eem|ingly
in the agonies of death. The
whole ca&s;tle was immediately rou&s;|ed,
and the confu&s;ion may be more ea|&s;ily
imagined than de&s;cribed. Emilia
amid the general alarm came to her fa|ther's
room, but the &s;ight of him over|came
her, and &s;he was carried from his
<PB N="196" REF="200">
pre&s;ence. By the help of proper appli|cations
the marquis recovered his &s;en&s;es,
and his pains had a &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation.</P>
<P>"I am dying," &s;aid he, in a faulter|ing
accent; "send in&s;tantly for the mar|chione&s;s
and my &s;on."</P>
<P>Ferdinand in e&s;caping from the hands
of the banditti, it was now &s;een had fal|len
into the power of his father. He
had been &s;ince confined in an apartment
of the ca&s;tle, and was now liberated to
obey the &s;ummons. The countenance
of the marquis exhibited a gha&s;tly
image; Ferdinand, when he drew near
the bed, &s;uddenly &s;hrunk back, over|come
with horror. The marquis now
beckoned his attendants to quit the
room, and they were preparing to obey,
when a violent noi&s;e was heard from
without; almo&s;t in the same in&s;tant the
door of the apartment was thrown open,
and the &s;ervant who had been &s;ent for
the marchione&s;s, ru&s;hed in. His look
alone declared the horror of his mind,
<PB N="197" REF="201">
for words he had none to utter. He
&s;tared wildly, and pointed to the gallery
he had quitted. Ferdinand, &s;eized
with new terror, ru&s;hed the way he
pointed to the apartment of the mar|chione&s;s.
A &s;pectacle of horror pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf. Maria lay on a couch
lifele&s;s, and bathed in blood. A poig|nard,
the in&s;trument of her de&s;truction,
was on the floor; and it appeared from
a letter which was found on the couch
be&s;ide her, that &s;he had died by her
own hand. The paper contained the&s;e
words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>TO THE MARQUIS DE MAZZINI.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR words have &s;tabbed my
heart. No power on earth could re|&s;tore
the peace you have de&s;troyed.
I will e&s;cape from my torture. When
you read this, I &s;hall be no more.
But the triumph &s;hall no longer be
<PB N="198" REF="202">
your's&mdash;the draught you have drank
was given by the hand of the in|jured</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MARIA DE MAZZINI.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>It now appeared that the marquis
was poi&s;oned by the vengeance of the
woman for whom he had re&s;igned his
con&s;cience. The con&s;ternation and di&s;|tre&s;s
of Ferdinand cannot ea&s;ily be con|ceived:
he ha&s;tened back to his father's
chamber, but determined to conceal
the dreadful cata&s;trophe of Maria de
Vellorno. This precaution, however,
was u&s;ele&s;s; for the &s;ervants, in the con|&s;ternation
of terror, had revealed it, and
the marquis had fainted.</P>
<P>Returning pains recalled his &s;en&s;es,
and the agonies he &s;uffered were too
&s;hocking for the beholders. Medical
endeavours were applied, but the poi|&s;on
was too powerful for antidote. The
marquis's pains at length &s;ub&s;ided; the
poi&s;on had exhau&s;ted mo&s;t its rage,
<PB N="199" REF="203">
and he became tolerably ea&s;y. He
waved his hand for the attendants to
leave the room; and beckoning to Fer|dinand,
who&s;e &s;en&s;es were almo&s;t &s;tun|ned
by this accumulation of horror, bade
him &s;it down be&s;ide him. "The hand
of death is now upon me," &s;aid he;
"I would employ the&s;e la&s;t moments
in revealing a deed, which is more dread|ful
to me than all the bodily agonies I &s;uf|fer.
It will be &s;ome relief to me to di&s;|cover
it." Ferdinand gra&s;ped the hand of
the marquis in &s;peechle&s;s terror. "The
retribution of heaven is upon me," re|&s;umed
the marquis. "My puni&s;hment
is the immediate con&s;equence of my
guilt. Heaven has made that woman
the in&s;trument of its ju&s;tice, whom I
made the in&s;trument of my crimes;&mdash;that
woman for who&s;e &s;ake I forgot con|&s;cience,
and braved vice&mdash;for whom I
impri&s;oned an innocent wife, and after|wards
murdered her."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words every nerve of Ferdi|nand
<PB N="200" REF="204">
thrilled; he let go the marquis's
hand, and &s;tarted back. "Look not
&s;o fiercely on me," &s;aid the marquis, in
a hollow voice;"your eyes &s;trike death
to my &s;oul; my con&s;cience needs not
this additional pang." "My mother!"
exclaimed Ferdinand&mdash;"my mother!
Speak, tell me"&mdash;"I have no breath,"
&s;aid the marquis. "Oh!&mdash;Take the&s;e
keys&mdash;the &s;outh tower&mdash;the trap-door.&mdash;"Tis
po&s;&s;ible&mdash;Oh!&mdash;"</P>
<P>The marquis made a &s;udden &s;pring
upwards, and fell lifele&s;s on the bed.
The attendants were called in, but he
was gone for ever. His la&s;t words &s;truck
with the force of lightning upon the
mind of Ferdinand; they &s;eemed to &s;ay
that his mother might yet exi&s;t. He
took the keys; and ordering &s;ome of the
&s;ervants to follow, ha&s;tened to the &s;ou|thern
building; he proceeded to the
tower, and the trap-door beneath the
&s;tair-ca&s;e was lifted. They all de&s;cend|ed
into a dark pa&s;&s;age, which conduct|ed
<PB N="201" REF="205">
them through &s;everal intricacies to
to the door of the cell. Ferdinand in
trembling horrible expectation, applied
the key; the door opened, and he enter|ed&mdash;but
what was his &s;urprize when he
found no per&s;on in the cell! He con|cluded
that he had mi&s;taken the place,
and quitted it for farther &s;earch; but,
having followed the windings of the
pa&s;&s;age, by which he entered, without
di&s;covering any other door, he return|ed
to a more exact examination of the
cell. He now ob&s;erved the door which
led to the cavern, and he entered upon
the avenue, but no per&s;on was found
there, and no voice an&s;wered to his call.
Having reached the door of the cavern,
which was fa&s;tened, he returned lo&s;t in
grief, and meditating upon the la&s;t
words of the marquis. He now thought
that he had mi&s;taken their import, and
that the words "tis po&s;&s;ible," were
not meant to apply to the life of the
marchione&s;s. He concluded that the
<PB N="202" REF="206">
murder had been committed at a di&s;tant
period; and he re&s;olved, therefore, to
have the ground of the cell dug up,
and the remains of his mother &s;ought
for.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t violence of the emoti|ons
excited by the late &s;cenes was &s;ub|&s;ided,
he enquired concerning Maria
de Vellorno.</P>
<P>It appeared that on the day preceding
this horrid tran&s;action, the marquis had
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in her apartment;
that they were heard in loud di&s;pute;&mdash;that
the pa&s;&s;ion of the marquis grew
high;&mdash;that he upbraided her with her
pa&s;&s;ed conduct, and threatened her with
a formal &s;eparation. When the mar|quis
quitted her, &s;he was heard walking
quick through the room, in a pa&s;&s;ion of
tears; &s;he often &s;uddenly &s;topped in ve|hement
but incoherent exclamation;
and at la&s;t threw her&s;elf on the floor,
and was for &s;ome time entirely &s;till.
Here her woman found her, upon who&s;e
<PB N="203" REF="207">
entrance &s;he aro&s;e ha&s;tily, and reproved
her for appearing un-called. After this
&s;he remained &s;ilent and &s;ullen.</P>
<P>She de&s;cended to &s;upper, where the
marquis met her alone at table. Little
was &s;aid during the repa&s;t, at the con|clu&s;ion
of which the &s;ervants were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed;
and it was believed that during
the interval between &s;upper, and the
hour of repo&s;e, Maria de Vellorno con|trived
to mingle poi&s;on with the wine
of the marquis. How &s;he had procur|ed
this poi&s;on was never di&s;covered.</P>
<P>She retired early to her chamber;
and her woman ob&s;erving that &s;he ap|peared
much agitated, enquired if &s;he
was ill. To this &s;he returned a &s;hort
an&s;wer in the negative, and her woman
was &s;oon afterwards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. But &s;he
had hardly &s;hut the door of the room,
when &s;he heard her lady's voice recall|ing
her. She returned, and received
&s;ome trifling order, and ob&s;erved that
Maria looked uncommonly pale; there
<PB N="204" REF="208">
was be&s;ides, a wildne&s;s in her eyes which
frightened her, but &s;he did not dare to
a&s;k any que&s;tions. She again quitted
the room, and had only reached the
extremity of the gallery, when her mi&s;|tre&s;s's
bell rang. She ha&s;tened back.
Maria enquired if the marquis was gone
to bed, and if all was quiet. Being an|&s;wered
in the affirmative, &s;he replied,
"This is a &s;till hour, and a dark
one!&mdash;Good night!"</P>
<P>Her woman having once more left
the room, &s;topped at the door to li&s;ten;
but all within remaining &s;ilent, &s;he re|tired
to re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is probable that Maria perpe|trated
the fatal act &s;oon after the di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion
of her woman; for when &s;he
was found two hours afterwards, &s;he
appeared to have been dead &s;ome time.
On examination a wound was di&s;cover|ed
on her left &s;ide, which had doubtle&s;s
penetrated to the heart, from the &s;ud|dene&s;s
of her death, and from the effu|&s;ion
of blood which had followed.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="209">
The&s;e terrible events &s;o deeply affect|ed
Emilia, that &s;he was confined to her
bed by a dangerous illne&s;s. Ferdinand
&s;truggled again&s;t the &s;hock with manly
fortitude. But amid all the tumult of
the pre&s;ent &s;cenes, his uncertainty con|cerning
Julia, whom he had left in the
hands of banditti, and whom he had
been with-held from &s;eeking or re&s;cu|ing,
formed perhaps the mo&s;t affecting
part of his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The late marquis de Mazzini, and
Maria de Vellorno, were interred with
the honour due to their rank in the
church of the convent of St. Nicolo.
Their lives exhibited a boundle&s;s indul|gence
of violent and luxurious pa&s;&s;ions,
and their deaths marked the con&s;equen|ces
of &s;uch indulgence, and held forth
to makind a &s;ingular in&s;tance of divine
vengeance.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>IN turning up the ground of the cell,
it was di&s;covered that it commu|nicated
with the dungeon in which
Ferdinand had been confined, and where
he had heard tho&s;e groans which occa|&s;ioned
him &s;o much terror.</P>
<P>The &s;tory which the marquis for|merly
related to his &s;on concerning the
&s;outhern buildings, it was now evident
was fabricated for the purpo&s;e of con|cealing
the impri&s;onment of the mar|chione&s;s.
In the choice of his &s;ubject,
he certainly di&s;covered &s;ome art; for
the circum&s;tance related was calculated,
by impre&s;&s;ing terror, to prevent farther
enquiry into the rece&s;&s;es of the&s;e build|ings.
It &s;erved al&s;o to explain by &s;u|per-natural
evidence the cau&s;e of tho&s;e
&s;ounds, and of that appearance which
had been there ob&s;erved, but which
were in reality occa&s;ioned only by the
marquis.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="211">
The event of the examination in the
cell threw Ferdinand into new perplex|ity.
The marquis had confe&s;&s;ed that
he poi&s;oned his wife&mdash;yet her remains
were not to be found; and the place
which he &s;ignified to be that of her con|finement,
bore no ve&s;tige of her having
been there. There appeared no way
by which &s;he could have e&s;caped from
her pri&s;on; for both the door which
opened upon the cell, and that which
terminated the avenue beyond, were
fa&s;tened when tried by Ferdinand.</P>
<P>But the young marquis had no time
for u&s;ele&s;s &s;peculation&mdash;&s;erious duties
called upon him. He believed that Ju|lia
was &s;till in the power of banditti;
and on the conclu&s;ion of his father's fu|neral,
he &s;et forward him&s;elf to Palermo
to give information of the abode of the
robbers, and to repair with the officers
of ju&s;tice, accompanied by a party of
his own people, to the re&s;cue of his
&s;i&s;ter. On his arrival at Palermo he
<PB N="208" REF="212">
was informed that a banditti, who&s;e re|treat
had been among the ruins of a mo|na&s;tery,
&s;ituated in the fore&s;t of Maren|tino,
was already di&s;covered; that their
abode had been &s;earched, and them|&s;elves
&s;ecured for examples of public
ju&s;tice&mdash;but that no captive lady had
been found among&s;t them. This lat|ter
intelligence excited in Ferdinand a
very &s;erious di&s;tre&s;s, and he was wholly
unable to conjecture her fate. He ob|tained
leave, however, to interrogate
tho&s;e of the robbers, who were impri|&s;oned
at Palermo, but could draw from
them no &s;atisfactory or certain inform|ation.</P>
<P>At length he quitted Palermo for the
fore&s;t of Marentino, thinking it po&s;&s;ible
that Julia might be heard of in its neigh|bourhood.
He travelled on in melan|choly
and dejection, and evening over|took
him long before he reached the
place of his de&s;tination. The night
came on heavily in clouds, and a vio|lent
<PB N="209" REF="213">
&s;torm of wind and rain aro&s;e. The
road lay through a wild and rocky coun|try,
and Ferdinand could obtain no
&s;helter. His attendants offered him their
cloaks, but he refu&s;ed to expo&s;e a &s;er|vant
to the hard&s;hip he would not him|&s;elf
endure. He travelled for &s;ome miles
in a heavy rain; and the wind, which
howled mournfully among the rocks,
and who&s;e &s;olemn pau&s;es were filled by
the di&s;tant roarings of the &s;ea, height|ened
the de&s;olation of the &s;cene. At
length he di&s;cerned amid the darkne&s;s
from a far, a red light waving in the
wind; it varied with the bla&s;t, but ne|ver
totally di&s;appeared. He pu&s;hed his
hor&s;es into a gallop, and made towards
it.</P>
<P>The flame continued to direct his
cour&s;e; and on a nearer approach, he
perceived by the red reflection of its
fires, &s;treaming a long radiance upon
the waters beneath&mdash;a light-hou&s;e &s;i|tuated
upon a point of rock which over|hung
<PB N="210" REF="214">
the &s;ea. He knocked for admit|tance,
and the door was opened by an
old man, who bade him welcome.</P>
<P>Within appeared a cheerful blazing
fire, round which were &s;eated &s;everal
per&s;ons, who &s;eemed like him&s;elf to
have &s;ought &s;helter from the tempe&s;t of
the night. The &s;ight of the fire cheer|ed
him, and he advanced towards it,
when a &s;udden &s;cream &s;eized his atten|tion;
the company ro&s;e up in confu&s;ion,
and in the &s;ame in&s;tant he di&s;covered
Julia and Hippolitus. The joy of that
moment is not to be de&s;cribed, but his
attention was quickly called off from his
own &s;ituation to that of a lady, who
during the general tran&s;port had faint|ed.
His &s;en&s;ations on learning &s;he was
his mother can only be conceived.</P>
<P>She revived. "My &s;on!" &s;aid &s;he,
in a languid voice, as &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him
to her heart. "Great God, I am re|compen&s;ed!
Surely this moment may
repay a life of mi&s;ery!" He could only
<PB N="211" REF="215">
receive her care&s;&s;es in &s;ilence; but the
&s;udden tears which &s;tarted in his eyes,
&s;poke a language too expre&s;&s;ive to be
mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t emotion of the &s;cene
was pa&s;&s;ed, Julia enquired by what
means Ferdinand had come to this &s;pot.
He an&s;wered her generally, and avoided
for the pre&s;ent entering upon the affect|ing
&s;ubject of the late events at the
ca&s;tle of Mazzini. Julia related the
hi&s;tory of her adventures &s;ince &s;he parted
with her brother. In her narration, it
appeared that Hippolitus, who was
taken by the duke de Luovo, at the
mouth of the cave, had afterwards e&s;|caped,
and returned to the cavern in
&s;earch of Julia. The low rece&s;s in the
rock, through which Julia had pa&s;&s;ed,
he perceived by the light of his flam|beau.
He penetrated to the cavern be|yond,
and from thence to the pri&s;on of
the marchione&s;s. No colour of lan|guage
can paint the &s;cene which follow|ed;
it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that the whole
<PB N="212" REF="216">
party agreed to quit the cell at the re|turn
of night. But this being a night
on which it was known the marquis
would vi&s;it the pri&s;on, they agreed to
defer their departure till after his ap|pearance,
and thus elude the danger to
be expected from an early di&s;covery of
the e&s;cape of the marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of foot&s;teps above, Hip|politus
and Julia had &s;ecreted them&s;elves
in the avenue; and immediately on the
marquis's departure they all repaired to
the cavern, leaving in the hurry of
their flight untouched the poi&s;onous
food he had brought. Having e&s;|caped
from thence they proceeded to
a neighbouring village, where hor&s;es
were procured to carry them towards
Palermo. Here after a tedious jour|ney
they arrived, in the de&s;ign of em|barking
for Italy. Contrary winds had
detained them till the day on which
Ferdinand left that city, when apprehen|&s;ive
and weary of delay, they hired a
&s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and determined to brave
<PB N="213" REF="217">
the winds. They had &s;oon rea&s;on to
repent their temerity; for the ve&s;&s;el had
not been long at &s;ea when the &s;torm
aro&s;e, which threw them back upon the
&s;hores of Sicily, and brought them to
the light-hou&s;e, where they were di&s;|covered
by Ferdinand.</P>
<P>On the following morning Ferdinand
returned with his friends to Palermo,
where he fir&s;t di&s;clo&s;ed the late fatal
events of the ca&s;tle. They now &s;ettled
their future plans; and Ferdinand ha&s;|tened
to the ca&s;tle of Mazzini to fetch
Emilia, and to give orders for the re|moval
of his hou&s;ehold to his palace at
Naples, where he de&s;igned to fix his fu|ture
re&s;idence. The di&s;tre&s;s of Emilia,
whom he found recovered from her in|di&s;po&s;ition,
yielded to joy and wonder,
when &s;he heard of the exi&s;tence of her
mother, and the &s;afety of her &s;i&s;ter.
She departed with Ferdinand for Paler|mo,
where her friends awaited her, and
where the joy of the meeting was con|&s;iderably
heightened by the appearance
<PB N="214" REF="218">
of Madame de Menon, for whom the
marchione&s;s had di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger
to St. Augu&s;tin's. Madame had quit|ted
the abbey for another convent, to
which however the me&s;&s;enger was di|rected.
This happy party now embark|ed
for Naples.</P>
<P>From this period the ca&s;tle of Maz|zini,
which had been the theatre of a
dreadful cata&s;trophe, and who&s;e &s;cenes
would have revived in the minds of the
chief per&s;onages connected with it,
painful and &s;hocking recollections&mdash;was
abandoned.</P>
<P>On their arrival at Naples, Ferdinand
pre&s;ented to the king a clear and &s;ati&s;|factory
account of the late events at the
ca&s;tle, in con&s;equence of which the mar|chione&s;s
was confirmed in her rank, and
Ferdinand was received as the &s;ixth mar|quis
de Mazzini.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s, thus re&s;tored to
the world, and to happine&s;s, re&s;ided
with her children in the palace at Na|ples,
where, after time had &s;omewhat
<PB N="215" REF="219">
mellowed the remembrance of the late
calamity, the nuptials of Hippolitus and
Julia were celebrated. The recollec|tion
of the difficulties they had encoun|tered,
and of the di&s;tre&s;s they had en|dured
for each other, now &s;erved only
to heighten by contra&s;t the happine&s;s of
the pre&s;ent period.</P>
<P>Ferdinand &s;oon after accepted a com|mand
in the Neapolitan army; and
amid&s;t the many heroes of that warlike
and turbulent age, di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf
for his valour and ability. The
occupations of war engaged his mind,
while his heart was occupied in pro|moting
the happine&s;s of his family.</P>
<P>Madame de Menon, who&s;e generous
attachment to the marchione&s;s had been
fully proved, found in the re&s;toration of
her friend a living witne&s;s of her mar|riage,
and thus recovered tho&s;e e&s;tates
which had been unju&s;tly with-held from
her. But the marchione&s;s and her fa|mily,
grateful to her friend&s;hip, and at|tached
<PB N="216" REF="220">
to her virtues, prevailed upon
her to &s;pend the remainder of her life
at the palace of Mazzini.</P>
<P>Emilia, wholly attached to her fa|mily,
continued to re&s;ide with the mar|chione&s;s,
who &s;aw her race renewed in
the children of Hippolitus and Julia.
Thus &s;urrounded by her children and
friends, and engaged in forming the
minds of the infant generation, &s;he
&s;eemed to forget that &s;he had ever been
otherwi&s;e than happy."</P>
<P>Here the manu&s;cript annals conclude.
In reviewing this &s;tory, we perceive a
&s;ingular and &s;triking in&s;tance of moral
retribution. We learn al&s;o, that tho&s;e
who do only THAT WHICH IS
RIGHT, endure nothing in misfortune
but a trial of their virtue, and from trials
well endured, derive the &s;ure&s;t claim to
the protection of heaven.</P>
