<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following day being Sunday, our Philo&s;ophers lay long in bed, while the re&s;t of us went to Church in the Neighbouring Town, where we dined at <HI>Euphranor</HI>'s, and after evening Service returned to the two Philo&s;ophers, whom we found in the Library. They told us, That, if there was a God, he was pre&s;ent every where, as well as at Church; and that if we had been &s;erving him one way, they did not neglect to do as much another; ina&s;much as a free exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on mu&s;t be allowed the mo&s;t acceptable &s;er|vice and Wor&s;hip, that a rational creature can of|fer to its Creator. However, &s;aid <HI>Alciphron,</HI> if you, Gentlemen, can but &s;olve the difficulties which I &s;hall propo&s;e to-morrow morning, I pro|mi&s;e to go to Church next Sunday. After &s;ome general conver&s;ation of this kind, we &s;ate down to a light Supper, and the next morning a&s;&s;embled at the &s;ame place as the day before, where being all &s;eated, I ob&s;erved, that the foregoing Week our Conferences had been carried on for a longer time, and with le&s;s interruption than I had ever known, or well cou'd be, in town, where Mens hours are &s;o broken by vi&s;its, bu&s;ine&s;s, and amu&s;e|ments, that whoever is content to form his noti|ons from conver&s;ation only, mu&s;t needs have them
<PB N="3" REF="8">
very &s;hatter'd and imperfect. And what have we got, replied <HI>Alciphron,</HI> by all the&s;e continued Conferences? For my part, I think my &s;elf ju&s;t where I was, with re&s;pect to the main point that divides us, the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion. I an&s;wered, That &s;o many points had been exa|mined, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and agreed between him and his adver&s;aries, that I hoped to &s;ee them come to an intire agreement in the end. For in the fir&s;t place, &s;aid I, the principles and opinions of tho&s;e who are called Free-thinkers, or Minute Philo|&s;ophers, have been pretty clearly explained. It hath been al&s;o agreed, that Vice is not of that benefit to the Nation, which &s;ome Men imagine: That Virtue is highly u&s;eful to Mankind: But that the beauty of Virtue is not alone &s;ufficient to engage them in the practice of it: That therefore the belief of a God and Providence ought to be encouraged in the State, and tolerated in good Company, as a u&s;eful notion. Further, it hath been proved that there is a God: That it is rea&s;on|able to wor&s;hip him: And that the Wor&s;hip, Faith, and Principles pre&s;cribed by the Chri&s;tian Religion have a u&s;eful tendency. Admit, replied <HI>Alciphron,</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Crito,</HI> all that <HI>Dion</HI> &s;aith to be true: Yet this doth not hinder my be|ing ju&s;t where I was, with re&s;pect to the main point. Since there is nothing in all this that proves the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion: Though each of tho&s;e particulars enumerated may, perhaps, prejudice in its favour. I am therefore to &s;u&s;pect my &s;elf at pre&s;ent for a prejudiced per&s;on; prejudiced, I &s;ay, in favour of Chri&s;ti|anity. This, as I am a lover of Truth, puts me upon my guard again&s;t deception. I mu&s;t there|fore look &s;harp, and well con&s;ider every &s;tep I take.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CRI.</HI> You may remember, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> you propo&s;ed for the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent conference the con&s;ideration of certain Difficulties and Ob|jections, which you had to offer again&s;t the Chri&s;ti|an Religion. We are now ready to hear and con|&s;ider whatever you &s;hall think fit to produce of that kind. Athei&s;m, and a wrong notion of Chri|&s;tianity, as of &s;omething hurtful to Mankind, are great Prejudices; the removal of which may di&s;|po&s;e a Man to argue with candor and &s;ubmit to rea&s;onable proof: But the removing Prejudices a|gain&s;t an opinion, is not to be reckoned prejudi|cing in its favour. It may be hoped therefore, that you will be able to do ju&s;tice to your cau&s;e, with|out being fond of it. <HI>ALC.</HI> O <HI>Crito!</HI> that Man may thank his &s;tars to whom Nature hath given a &s;ub|lime Soul, who can rai&s;e him&s;elf above popular opinions, and, looking down on the herd of Man|kind, behold them &s;cattered over the &s;urface of the whole earth, divided and &s;ubdivided into num|berle&s;s Nations and Tribes, differing in Notions and Tenets, as in Language, Manners, and Dre&s;s. The Man who takes a general view of the World and its Inhabitants, from this lofty &s;tand, above the reach of Prejudice, &s;eems to breathe a purer air, and to &s;ee by a clearer light: But how to im|part this clear and exten&s;ive view to tho&s;e who are wandering beneath in the narrow dark paths of Error! This indeed is a hard task; but, hard as it is, I &s;hall try if by any means,</P>
<Q>Clara tuae po&s;&s;im praepandere lumina menti.</Q>
<BIBL>Lucret.</BIBL>
<P>Know then, that all the various Ca&s;ts or Sects of the &s;ons of Men have each their Faith, and their
<PB N="5" REF="10">
religious Sy&s;tem, germinating and &s;prouting forth from that common grain of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, which is an original ingredient in the compo&s;ition of Humane Nature, they &s;hall each tell of in|tercour&s;e with the invi&s;ible World, Revelati|ons from Heaven, divine Oracles, and the like. All which preten&s;ions, when I regard with an impartial eye, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hou'd a&s;&s;ent to all, and I find within my &s;elf &s;omething that with|holds me from a&s;&s;enting to any of them. For al|though I may be willing to follow, &s;o far as com|mon Sen&s;e, and the light of Nature lead; yet the &s;ame rea&s;on that bids me yield to rational proof, forbids me to admit opinions without proof. This holds in general again&s;t all Revelations what&s;o|ever. And be this my fir&s;t Objection again&s;t the Chri&s;tian in particular. <HI>CRI.</HI> As this Objection &s;uppo&s;es there is no proof or rea&s;on for believing the Chri&s;tian, if good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for &s;uch belief, it comes to nothing. Now I pre&s;ume you will grant, the authority of the reporter is a true and proper rea&s;on for believing reports: And the better this authority, the ju&s;ter claim it hath to our a&s;&s;ent: But the authority of God is on all accounts the be&s;t: Whatever therefore comes from God, it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to believe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALC.</HI> This I grant, but then it mu&s;t be proved to come from God. <HI>CRI.</HI> And are not Miracles, and the accompli&s;hments of Prophecies, joined with the excellency of its Doctrine, a &s;uffi|cient proof that the Chri&s;tian Religion came from God? <HI>ALC.</HI> Miracles, indeed, wou'd prove &s;ome|thing: But what proof have we of the&s;e Miracles? <HI>CRI.</HI> Proof of the &s;ame kind that we have or can have of any facts done a great way off, and a long time ago. We have authentic accounts tran&s;mit|ted down to us from eye-witne&s;&s;es, whom we can|not
<PB N="6" REF="11">
conceive tempted to impo&s;e upon us by any humane Motive what&s;oever; ina&s;much as they act|ed therein contrary to their Intere&s;ts, their Preju|dices, and the very Principles in which they had been nur&s;ed and educated. The&s;e accounts were confirmed by the unparallel'd &s;ubver&s;ion of the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the di&s;per&s;ion of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, which is a &s;tanding te&s;timony to the Truth of the Go&s;pel, particularly of the Predicti|ons of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. The&s;e accounts, with|in le&s;s than a Century, were &s;pread throughout the World, and believed by great numbers of People. The&s;e &s;ame accounts were committed to writing, tran&s;lated into &s;everal languages, and handed down with the &s;ame re&s;pect and con&s;ent of Chri&s;tians in the mo&s;t di&s;tant Churches. Do you not &s;ee, &s;aid <HI>Alciphron,</HI> &s;taring full at <HI>Crito,</HI> that all this hangs by Tradition? And Tradition, take my word for it, gives but a weak hold: It is a chain, whereof the fir&s;t links may be &s;tronger than &s;teel, and yet the la&s;t weak as wax, and brittle as gla&s;s. Imagine a picture copied &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by an hundred Painters, one from another; how like mu&s;t the la&s;t copy be to the original! How lively and di&s;tinct will an image be, after an hundred reflections between two parallel Mirrours! Thus like, and thus lively do I think a faint vani&s;hing Tradition, at the end of &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen hundred years. Some Men have a fal&s;e heart, others a wrong head; and where both are true, the memory may be treacherous. Hence there is &s;till &s;omething added, &s;omething omitted, and &s;omething varied from the Truth: And the &s;um of many &s;uch additions, deductions, and alterations, accumulated for &s;everal ages, do, at the foot of the account, make quite another thing. <HI>CRI.</HI> Ancient facts we may know by Tradition, oral or written: And this latter we may divide into two kinds, private and public, as
<PB N="7" REF="12">
Writings are kept in the hands of particular Men, or recorded in public Archives. Now all the&s;e three &s;orts of Tradition, for ought I can &s;ee, con|cur to atte&s;t the genuine antiquity of the Go&s;pels. And they are &s;trengthened by collateral evidence from Rites in&s;tituted, Fe&s;tivals ob&s;erved, and Mo|numents erected by ancient Chri&s;tians, &s;uch as Churches, Bapti&s;teries, and Sepulchres. Now allowing your objection holds again&s;t oral Tradi|tion, &s;ingly taken, yet I can think it no &s;uch diffi|cult thing to tran&s;cribe faithfully. And things once committed to writing, are &s;ecure from &s;lips of memory, and may with common care be pre|&s;erved intire &s;o long as the Manu&s;cript la&s;ts: And this, experience &s;hews may be above a thou&s;and years. The <HI>Alexandrine</HI> Manu&s;cript is allowed to be above twelve hundred years old; and it is high|ly probable there were then extant copies four hundred years old. A Tradition therefore of a|bove &s;ixteen hundred years, need have only two or three links in its chain. And the&s;e links, not|with&s;tanding that great length of time, may be very &s;ound and intire. Since no rea&s;onable Man will deny, that an ancient Manu&s;cript may be of much the &s;ame credit now, as when it was fir&s;t written. We have it on good authority, and it &s;eems probable, that the primitive Chri&s;tians were careful to tran&s;cribe copies of the Go&s;pels and E|pi&s;tles for their private u&s;e, and that other copies were pre&s;erved as public records, in the &s;everal Churches throughout the World, and that porti|ons thereof were con&s;tantly read in their a&s;&s;emblies. Can more be &s;aid to prove the writings of Cla&s;&s;ic Authors, or ancient Records of any kind authen|tic? <HI>Alciphron,</HI> addre&s;&s;ing his di&s;cour&s;e to <HI>Euphra|nor,</HI> &s;aid, It is one thing to &s;ilence an adver&s;ary, and another to convince him. What do you think, <HI>Euphranor? EUPH.</HI> Doubtle&s;s it is. <HI>ALC.</HI>

But what I want, is to be convinced. <HI>EUPH.</HI> That point is not &s;o clear. <HI>ALC.</HI> But if a Man had ever &s;o much mind, he cannot be convinced by probable arguments again&s;t Demon&s;tration. <HI>EUPH.</HI> I grant he cannot.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALC.</HI> Now it is as evident as demon&s;tra|tion can make it, that no divine Faith can po&s;&s;ibly be built upon Tradition. Suppo&s;e an hone&s;t credu|lous Countryman catechi&s;ed and lectured every Sun|day by his Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t: It is plain he believes in the Par&s;on, and not in God. He knows nothing of Revelations, and Doctrines, and Miracles, but what the Prie&s;t tells him. This he believes, and this Faith is purely humane. If you &s;ay he has the Li|turgy and the Bible for the foundation of his Faith, the difficulty &s;till recurs. For as to the Liturgy, he pins his faith upon the civil Magi&s;trate, as well as the Eccle&s;ia&s;tic: neither of which can pretend divine In&s;piration. Then for the Bible, he takes both that and his Prayer-Book on tru&s;t from the Printer, who, he believes, made true Editions from true Copies. You &s;ee then faith, but what faith? Faith in the Prie&s;t, in the Magi&s;trate, in the Printer, Editor, Tran&s;criber, none of which can with any pretence be called Divine. I had the hint from <HI>Cratylus;</HI> it is a &s;haft out of his quiver, and believe me, a keen one. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Let me take and make trial of this &s;ame &s;haft in my hands. Suppo&s;e then your Countryman hears a Magi&s;trate declare the Law from the Bench, or &s;uppo&s;e he reads it in a Statute Book. What think you, is the Printer or the Ju&s;|tice the true and proper object of his Faith and Submi&s;&s;ion? Or do you acknowledge a higher autho|rity whereon to found tho&s;e loyal acts, and in which they do really terminate? Again &s;uppo&s;e you read a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Tacitus</HI> that you believe true; wou'd you &s;ay you a&s;&s;ented to it on the authority of the
<PB N="9" REF="16">
Printer or Tran&s;criber rather than the Hi&s;torian? <HI>ALC.</HI> Perhaps I wou'd, and perhaps I wou'd not. I do not think my &s;elf obliged to an&s;wer the&s;e points. What is this but transferring the que&s;tion from one &s;ubject to another? That which we con&s;idered was neither Law nor prophane Hi&s;tory, but religious Tradition, and Divine Faith. I &s;ee plainly what you aim at, but &s;hall never take fro an an&s;wer to one dif|ficulty, the &s;tarting of another. <HI>CRI.</HI> O <HI>Al|ciphron,</HI> there is no taking hold of you who expect that others &s;hou'd (as you were plea&s;ed to expre&s;s it) hold fair and &s;tand firm, while you plucked out their prejudices: How &s;hall he argue with you but from your conce&s;&s;ions, and how can he know what you grant except you will be plea&s;ed to tell him? <HI>EUPH.</HI> But to &s;ave you the trouble, for once I will &s;uppo&s;e an an&s;wer. My que&s;tion admits but of two an&s;wers; take your Choice. From the one it will follow, that by a parity of rea&s;on we can ea&s;ily conceive, how a Man may have Divine Faith, though he never felt In&s;piration or &s;aw a Miracle: ina&s;much as it is equally po&s;&s;ible for the mind, through whatever conduit, oral or &s;criptural, di|vine Revelation be derived, to carry its thought and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion up to the &s;ource and terminate its faith, not in Humane but Divine authority: not in the in&s;trument or ve&s;&s;el of conveyance, but in the great origine it &s;elf as its proper and true object. From the other an&s;wer itwill follow, that you introduce a general &s;ceptici&s;m into Humane Knowledge, and break down the hinges on which civil Government, and all the affairs of the World turn and depend: in a word that you wou'd de&s;troy Humane Faith to get rid of Divine. And how this agrees with your profe&s;&s;ing that you want to be convinced I leave you to con&s;ider.</P>

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> I &s;hou'd in earne&s;t be glad to be con|vinced one way or other, and come to &s;ome conclu|clu&s;ion.

But I have &s;o many objections in &s;tore, you are not to count much upon getting over one. Depend on it you &s;hall find me behave like a Gen|tleman and lover of Truth. I will propo&s;e my objections briefly and plainly, and accept of rea|&s;onable an&s;wers as fa&s;t as you can give them. Come, <HI>Euphranor,</HI> make the mo&s;t of your Tradition; you can never make that a con&s;tant and univer&s;al one, which is acknowledged to have been unknown, or at be&s;t di&s;puted in the Church for &s;everal Ages: And this is the Ca&s;e of the Canon of the new Te&s;|tament. For though we have now a Canon as they call it &s;ettled; yet every one mu&s;t &s;ee and own that Tradition cannot grow &s;tronger by Age; and that what was uncertain in the primitive times cannot be undoubted in the &s;ub&s;equent. What &s;ay you to this, <HI>Euphranor? EUPH.</HI> I &s;hou'd be glad to conceive your meaning clearly before I return an an&s;wer. It &s;eems to me this objection of yours &s;up|po&s;eth, that where a Tradition hath been con&s;tant and undi&s;puted, &s;uch Tradition may be admitted as a proof, but that where the Tradition is defec|tive, the proof mu&s;t be &s;o too. Is this your mean|ing? <HI>ALC.</HI> It is. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Con&s;equently the Go&s;|pels and Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> which were univer|&s;ally received in the beginning, and never &s;ince doubted of by the Church, mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding this objection, be in rea&s;on admitted for genuine. And if the&s;e Books contain, as they really do, all tho&s;e points that come into controver&s;y between you and me; what need I di&s;pute with you about the authority of &s;ome other Books of the new Te&s;|tament, which came later to be generally known and received in the Church? If a Man a&s;&s;ents to the undi&s;puted Books he is no longer an Infidel; though he &s;hou'd not hold the Revelations, or the Epi&s;tle of S. <HI>James</HI> or <HI>Jude,</HI> or the latter of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> or the two la&s;t of S. <HI>John</HI> to be Canonical.
<PB N="11" REF="18">
The additional authority of the&s;e portions of Holy Scripture may have its weight, in particular con|trover&s;ies between Chri&s;tians, but can add nothing to arguments again&s;t an Infidel as &s;uch. Wherefore though I believe good rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for receiving the&s;e Books, yet the&s;e rea&s;ons &s;eem now be&s;ide our purpo&s;e. When you are a Chri&s;tian it will be then time enough to argue this point. And you will be the nearer being &s;o, if the way be &s;horten'd by omitting it for the pre&s;ent. <HI>ALC.</HI> Not &s;o near neither as you perhaps imagine: For, notwith&s;tanding all the fair and plau&s;ible things you may &s;ay about Tradition, when I con&s;ider the Spirit of Forgery which reigned in the primitive times, and reflect on the &s;everal Go&s;pels, Acts, and Epi&s;tles attributed to the Apo&s;tles, which yet are acknowledged to be &s;purious, I confe&s;s, I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting the whole. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Tell me, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> do you &s;u&s;pect all <HI>Plato</HI>'s Writings for &s;purious, becau&s;e the Dialogue upon Death, for in&s;tance, is allowed to be &s;o? Or will you admit none of <HI>Tully</HI>'s Writings to be genuine, becau&s;e <HI>Sigonius</HI> impo&s;ed a Book of his own writing for <HI>Tully</HI>'s Treati&s;e <HI>de Con&s;olatione,</HI> and the impo&s;ture pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ome time on the World? <HI>ALC.</HI> Sup|po&s;e I admit for the Works of <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Plato</HI> tho&s;e that commonly pa&s;s for &s;uch. What then? <HI>EUPH.</HI> Why then I wou'd fain know, whether it be equal and impartial in a Free-thinker, to mea&s;ure the credibility of profane and &s;acred Books by a different rule. Let us know upon what foot we Chri&s;tians are to argue with Minute Philo&s;o|phers; whether we may be allowed the benefit of common maxims in Logic and Critici&s;m? If we may, be plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on why &s;uppo&s;iti|tious Writings, which in the &s;tyle and manner and matter bear vi&s;ible marks of impo&s;ture, and have accordingly been rejected by the Church, can be

made an argument again&s;t tho&s;e which have been univer&s;ally received, and handed down by an unani|mous con&s;tant Tradition. There have been in all Ages and in all great Societies of Men, many capricious, vain or wicked Impo&s;tors, who for different ends have abu&s;ed the World by &s;purious Writings, and created work for Critics both in profane and &s;acred Learning. And it would &s;eem as &s;illy to reject the true Writings of profane Authors for the &s;ake of the &s;purious, as it wou'd &s;eem unrea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, that among the Hereticks and &s;everal Sects of Chri&s;tians, there &s;hou'd be none capable of the like Impo&s;ture.</P>

<P>But what apology can be made for Non|&s;en&s;e, crude Non&s;en&s;e? Of which I cou'd ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ign many in&s;tances, having once in my Life read the Scripture through with that very view. Look here, &s;aid he, opening a Bible, in the forty ninth P&s;alm, the Author begins very magnificently, call|ing upon all the inhabitants of the Earth to give ear, and a&s;&s;uring them his mouth &s;hall &s;peak of wi&s;|dom, and the meditation of his heart &s;hall be of under&s;tanding.</P>

<P>He hath no &s;ooner done with his Preface, but he puts this &s;enlele&s;s que&s;tion. <Q>Wherefore &s;hou'd I fear in the days of evil; when the wickedne&s;s of my heels &s;hall compa&s;s me about?</Q> The iniquity of my heels! What Non&s;en&s;e after &s;uch a &s;olemn introduction! <HI>EUPH.</HI> For my own part, I have naturally weak eyes, and know there are many things that I cannot &s;ee, which are neverthele&s;s di&s;tinctly &s;een by others. I do not therefore con|clude a thing to be ab&s;olutely invi&s;ible; becau&s;e it is &s;o to me: And &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible it may be with my under&s;tanding, as it is with my eyes, I dare not pronounce a thing to be Non&s;en&s;e, be|cau&s;e I do not under&s;tand it. Of this pa&s;&s;age many interpretations are given. The word render'd heels may &s;ignify fraud or &s;upplantation: By &s;ome it is tran&s;lated pa&s;t wickedne&s;s, the heel being the hin|der part of the foot; by others iniquity in the end of my days, the heel being one extremity of the body; by &s;ome the iniquity of my Enemies that may &s;upplant me; by others my own faults

or iniquities which I have pa&s;&s;ed over as light mat|ters, and trampled under my feet. Some render it the iniquity of my ways; others my tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions which are like &s;lips and &s;lidings of the heel: And after all might not this expre&s;&s;ion &s;o har&s;h and odd to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ears have been very natural and ob|vious in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue, which, as every other Language, had its idioms? the force and propriety whereof may as ea&s;ily be conceived lo&s;t in a long tract of time, as the &s;ignification of &s;ome <HI>Hebrew</HI> words, which are not now intelligible, though no body doubts but they had once a meaning as well as the other words of that Language. Granting therefore that certain pa&s;&s;ages in the Holy Scrip|ture may not be under&s;tood, it will not thence fol|low that its Penmen wrote Non&s;en&s;e: For I con|ceive Non&s;en&s;e to be one thing and unintelligible another. <HI>CRI.</HI> An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman of my ac|quaintance one day entertaining &s;ome Foreigners at his Hou&s;e, &s;ent a Servant to know the occa&s;ion of a &s;udden tumult in the yard, who brought him word, the Hor&s;es were fallen together by the ears: his Gue&s;ts inquiring what the matter was, he tran|&s;lates it literally; <HI>Les Chevaux &s;ont tombez en&s;emble par les oreilles.</HI> Which made them &s;tare; what ex|pre&s;&s;ed a very plain &s;en&s;e in the original <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> being incomprehen&s;ible when rendered word for word into <HI>French:</HI> And I remember to have heard a Man excu&s;e the bulls of his Countrymen, by &s;uppo|&s;ing them &s;o many literal tran&s;lations. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But not to grow tedious, I refer to the Critics and and Commentators where you will find the u&s;e of this remark, which clearing up &s;everal ob&s;cure pa&s;|&s;ages you took for Non&s;en&s;e, may po&s;&s;ibly incline you to &s;u&s;pect your own judgment of the re&s;t.

of the original &s;en&s;e of the Author, in that part which he cou'd not under&s;tand.

Tho&s;e &s;ources of ob&s;curity you mention are all common both to &s;acred and profane Writings: And there is no doubt, but an exacter knowledge in Language and Circum&s;tances wou'd in both, cau&s;e difficulties to vani&s;h like &s;hades before the light of the Sun. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to de&s;cribe a furious invader &s;aith; <HI>Behold, he &s;hall come up as a Lion from the &s;welling of</HI> Jordan <HI>again&s;t the habitation of the &s;trong.</HI> One wou'd be apt to think this pa&s;&s;age odd and improper, and that it had been more rea&s;onable to have &s;aid, <HI>a Lion from the mountain or the de&s;art.</HI> But travellers, as an ingenious Man ob&s;erves, who have &s;een the River <HI>Jordan</HI> bounded by low Lands with many reeds or thickets affording &s;helter to wild Bea&s;ts, (which being &s;uddenly di&s;lodged by a rapid overflowing of the River, ru&s;h into the up|land Country) perceive the force and propriety of the Compari&s;on; and that the difficulty proceeds, not from Non&s;en&s;e in the Writer, but from Igno|rance in the Reader. It is needle&s;s to ama&s;s to|gether in&s;tances which may be found in every Com|mentator: I only beg leave to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome|times Men, looking higher or deeper than they need for a profound or remote &s;en&s;e, overlook the natural obvious &s;en&s;e, lying, if I may &s;o &s;ay, at their feet, and &s;o make difficulties in&s;tead of finding them. This &s;eems to be the ca&s;e of that celebrated pa&s;&s;age, which hath created &s;o much work in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> <Q>What

&s;hall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead ri&s;e not at all? why are they then bap|tized for the dead?</Q> I remember to have heard this text explained by <HI>Laches</HI> the Vicar of our Pari&s;h to my Neighbour <HI>Lycon,</HI> who was much perplexed about its meaning. If it had been tran|&s;lated as it might very ju&s;tly, <HI>baptized for the &s;ake of the dead,</HI> I do not &s;ee, &s;aid <HI>Laches,</HI> why people &s;hou'd be puzzled about the &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age; for tell me, I be&s;eech you, for who&s;e &s;ake do you think tho&s;e Chri&s;tians were baptized? For who&s;e &s;ake, an&s;wered <HI>Lycon,</HI> but their own? How do you mean, for their own &s;ake in this life, or the next? Doubtle&s;s in the next, for it was plain they could get nothing by it in this. They were then, replied <HI>Laches,</HI> baptized not for the &s;ake of them|&s;elves while living, but for the &s;ake of them&s;elves when dead; not for the living, but the dead. I grant it. Bapti&s;m therefore mu&s;t have been to them a fruitle&s;s thing, if the dead ri&s;e not at all. It mu&s;t. Whence <HI>Laches</HI> inferred, That St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s argument was clear and pertinent for the Re&s;ur|rection: And <HI>Lycon</HI> allowed it to be <HI>argumentum ad hominem</HI> to tho&s;e who had &s;ought Bapti&s;m.

many words to be found in them, is no new di&s;|covery of Minute Philo&s;ophers, but known and ob&s;erved long before by Chri&s;tian Writers; who have made no &s;cruple to grant, that &s;ome things might have been in&s;erted by carele&s;s or mi&s;taken Tran&s;cribers into the Text, from the Margin, o|thers left out, and others altered; whence &s;o many various readings. But the&s;e are things of &s;mall moment, and that all other ancient Authors have been &s;ubject to; and upon which no point of Doc|trine depends, which may not be proved without them. Nay further, if it be any advantage to your cau&s;e, it hath been ob&s;erved, that the eighteenth <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> as recited in the twenty &s;econd chapter of the &s;econd book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> varies in above forty places, if you regard every little verbal or literal difference: And that a Critic may now and then di&s;cover &s;mall variations, is what no body can de|ny. But to make the mo&s;t of the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, what can you infer from them, more than that the de&s;ign of the Holy Scripture was not to make us exactly knowing in Circum&s;tantials? and that the Spirit did not dictate every Particle and Syllable, or pre&s;erve them from every minute alteration by Miracle? which to believe, wou'd look like Rabi|nical Super&s;tition. <HI>ALC.</HI> But what marks of Divi|nity can po&s;&s;ibly be in writings which do not reach the exactne&s;s even of Humane Art? <HI>EUPH.</HI> I never thought nor expected that the Holy Scrip|ture &s;hou'd &s;hew it &s;elf divine, by a circum&s;tantial accuracy of Narration, by exactne&s;s of Method, by &s;trictly ob&s;erving the rules of Rhetoric, Grammar, and Critici&s;m, in harmonious Periods, in elegant and choice Expre&s;&s;ions, or in technical Definitions and Partitions. The&s;e things wou'd look too like a Humane Compo&s;ition. Methinks there is in that &s;imple, unaffected, artle&s;s, unequal, bold, figura|tive Style of the Holy Scripture, a character &s;in|gularly
<PB N="19" REF="26">
great and maje&s;tic, and that looks more like divine In&s;piration, than any other Compo&s;iti|on that I know. But, as I &s;aid before, I &s;hall not di&s;pute a point of Critici&s;m with the gentlemen of your Sect, who, it &s;eems, are the modern &s;tandard for Wit and Ta&s;te. <HI>ALC.</HI> Well, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on &s;mall &s;lips, or the inaccuracy of citing or tran|&s;cribing: And I freely own, that Repetitions, want of Method, or want of Exactne&s;s in circum|&s;tances, are not the things that chiefly &s;tick with me; no more than the plain patriarchal Manners, or the peculiar U&s;ages and Cu&s;toms of the Jews and fir&s;t Chri&s;tians &s;o different from ours; and that to reject the Scripture on &s;uch accounts wou'd be to act like tho&s;e <HI>French</HI> Wits, who cen&s;ure <HI>Homer</HI> be|cau&s;e they do not find in him the Style, Notions and Manners of their own Age and Country. Was there nothing el&s;e to divide us, I &s;hou'd make no great difficulty of owning, That a popular uncor|rect Style might an&s;wer the general ends of Reve|lation, as well, perhaps, as a more critical and exact one: But the Ob&s;curity &s;till &s;ticks with me.

I have &s;aid &s;everal things, and have many more to &s;ay, which, believe me, have weight not only with my &s;elf, but with many great Men my very good friends, and will have weight what|ever <HI>Euphranor</HI> can &s;ay to the contrary. <HI>EUPH.</HI> O <HI>Alciphron,</HI> I envy you the happine&s;s of &s;uch ac|quaintance.

I con|&s;ider you as two able Chirurgeons, and you were plea&s;ed to con&s;ider me as a Patient, who&s;e cure you have generou&s;ly undertaken. Now a Patient mu&s;t have full liberty to explain his ca&s;e, and tell

all his Symptoms, the concealing or palliating of which might prevent a perfect cure. You will be plea&s;ed therefore to under&s;tand me, not as object|ing to, or arguing again&s;t, either your Skill or Medicines, but only as &s;etting forth my own ca&s;e and the effects they have upon me. Say, <HI>Alci|phron,</HI> did you not give me to under&s;tand that you wou'd extirpate my prejudices? <HI>ALC.</HI> It is true: a good Phy&s;ician eradicates every fibre of the di&s;|ea&s;e. Come, you &s;hall have a patient hearing. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Pray, was it not the opinion of <HI>Plato,</HI> that God in&s;pired particular Men, as Organs or Trumpets, to proclaim and &s;ound forth his Oracles to the World? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plato</HI> in <HI>Ione.</HI></NOTE> And was not the &s;ame opinion al&s;o embraced by others the greate&s;t Writers of Antiquity? <HI>CRI. Socrates</HI> &s;eems to have thought that all true Poets &s;poke by In&s;piration; and <HI>Tul|ly,</HI> that there was no extraordinary Genius with|out it. This hath made &s;ome of our affected Free-thinkers attempt to pa&s;s them&s;elves upon the World for Enthu&s;ia&s;ts. <HI>ALC.</HI> What wou'd you infer from all this? <HI>EUPH.</HI> I wou'd infer that in&s;pi|ration &s;hou'd &s;eem nothing impo&s;&s;ible or ab&s;urd, but rather agreeable to the light of rea&s;on and the no|tions of Mankind. And this, I &s;uppo&s;e, you will acknowledge, having made it an Objection again&s;t a particular Revelation, that there are &s;o many pretences to it throughout the World. <HI>ALC.</HI> O <HI>Euphranor,</HI> he, who looks into the bottom of things, and re&s;olves them into their fir&s;t principles, is not ea&s;ily amu&s;ed with words. The word <HI>In|&s;piration</HI> &s;ounds indeed big, but let us, if you plea&s;e, take an original view of the thing &s;ignified by it. To in&s;pire is a word borrowed from the <HI>Latin,</HI> and &s;trictly taken means no more than to breathe or blow in: nothing therefore can be in|&s;pired but what can be blown or breathed, and nothing can be &s;o but wind or vapour, which in|deed
<PB N="25" REF="32">
may fill or puff up Men with fanatical and hypochondriacal ravings. This &s;ort of In&s;piration I very readily admit. <HI>EUPH.</HI> What you &s;ay is &s;ubtle, and I know not what effect it might have upon me, if your profound di&s;cour&s;e did not hin|der its own operation. <HI>ALC.</HI> How &s;o? <HI>EUPH.</HI> Tell me, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> do you di&s;cour&s;e or do you not? To me it &s;eems that you di&s;cour&s;e admirably. <HI>ALC.</HI> Be that as it will, it is certain I di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But when I endeavour to look into the bottom of things, behold! A &s;cruple ri&s;eth in my mind how this can be; for to <HI>di&s;cour&s;e</HI> is a word of <HI>Latin</HI> derivation, which originally &s;ignifies to run about; and a Man cannot run about, but he mu&s;t change place and move his Legs; &s;o long there|fore as you &s;it on this Bench, you cannot be &s;aid to di&s;cour&s;e. Solve me this difficulty, and then perhaps I may be able to &s;olve yours. <HI>ALC.</HI> You are to know, that di&s;cour&s;e is a word bor|rowed from &s;en&s;ible things, to expre&s;s an invi&s;ible action of the mind, rea&s;oning or inferring one thing from another; and in this tran&s;lated &s;en&s;e, we may be &s;aid to di&s;cour&s;e, though we &s;it &s;till. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And may we not as well conceive, that the term In&s;piration might be borrowed from &s;en|&s;ible things to denote an action of God, in an ex|traordinary manner, influencing, exciting, and en|lightening the mind of a Prophet or an Apo&s;tle? who, in this &s;econdary, figurative, and tran&s;lated &s;en&s;e, may truly be &s;aid to be in&s;pired, though there &s;hou'd be nothing in the ca&s;e of that wind or vapour implied in the original &s;en&s;e of the word? It &s;eems to me, that we may by looking into our own minds plainly perceive certain in&s;tincts, im|pul&s;es, and tendencies, which at proper periods and occa&s;ions &s;pring up unaccountably in the Soul of Man. We ob&s;erve very vi&s;ible &s;igns of the &s;ame in all other Animals. And the&s;e things being or|dinary
<PB N="26" REF="33">
and natural, what hinders but we may con|ceive it po&s;&s;ible for the humane Mind, upon an extraordinary account, to be moved in an extra|ordinary manner, and its faculties &s;tirred up and actuated by a &s;upernatural Power? That there are and have been, and are likely to be wild vi&s;ions and hypochondriacal ravings, no body can deny; but to infer from thence, that there are no true In&s;pi|rations wou'd be too like concluding, that &s;ome Men are not in their &s;en&s;es, becau&s;e other Men are fools. And though I am no Prophet, and con&s;equently cannot pretend to a clear notion of this matter; yet I &s;hall not therefore take upon me to deny, but a true Prophet or in&s;pired Per&s;on, might have had as certain means, of di&s;cerning be|tween divine In&s;piration and hypochondriacal fan|cy, as you can between &s;leeping and waking, till you have proved the contrary. You may meet in the Book of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> with this pa&s;&s;age: <Q>The Prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream: And he that hath my word, let him &s;peak my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the Wheat, &s;aith the Lord? Is not my word like as a fire, &s;aith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?</Q> *You &s;ee here a di&s;tinction made between Wheat and Chaff, true and &s;purious, with the mighty force and power of the former. But I beg pardon for quoting Scrip|ture to you, I make my appeal to the general &s;en&s;e of Mankind, and the Opinion of the wi&s;e&s;t Hea|thens, which &s;eems &s;ufficient to conclude Divine In&s;piration po&s;&s;ible, if not probable, at lea&s;t till you prove the contrary.</P>

Having &s;uppo&s;ed this, can you deny, that their in&s;pired Di&s;cour&s;es and Revelations might have been committed to Wri|ting, or that being written, after a long tract of time they might become in &s;everal places ob&s;cure; that &s;ome of them might even originally have been le&s;s clear than others, or that they might &s;uf|fer &s;ome alteration by frequent tran&s;cribing, as o|ther Writings are known to have done? Is it not even very probable that all the&s;e things wou'd hap|pen? <HI>ALC.</HI> I grant it. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And granting this, with what pretence can you reject the Holy Scriptures as not being divine, upon the account of &s;uch &s;igns or marks, as you acknowledge wou'd probably attend a Divine Revelation tran&s;mitted down to us through &s;o many Ages? <HI>ALC.</HI> But allowing all that in rea&s;on you can de&s;ire, and granting that this may account for &s;ome ob&s;curity, may reconcile &s;ome &s;mall differences, or &s;atisfy us how &s;ome difficulties might ari&s;e by in&s;erting, o|mitting or changing here and there a letter, a word, or perhaps a &s;entence: Yet the&s;e are but &s;mall matters, in re&s;pect of the much more con&s;i|derable and weighty objections I cou'd produce, again&s;t the confe&s;&s;ed doctrines, or &s;ubject matter of tho&s;e Writings. Let us &s;ee what is contained in the&s;e &s;acred Books, and then judge whether it is probable or po&s;&s;ible, &s;uch Revelations &s;hou'd ever have been made by God? Now I defy the wit of Man to contrive any thing more extraya|gant, than the accounts we there find of Appari|tions, Devils, Miracles, God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, Regeneration, Grace, Self-denial, Re&s;urrection of the dead, and &s;uch like <HI>aegri &s;omnia:</HI> things &s;o odd,

Methinks it may con&s;i&s;t with all due deference to the greate&s;t of Humane Un|der&s;tandings, to &s;uppo&s;e them ignorant of many things, which are not &s;uited to their faculties, or lie out of their reach. Even the Coun&s;els of Prin|ces lie often beyond the ken of their Subjects, who can only know &s;o much as is revealed by tho&s;e at the helm; and are often unqualified to judge of the u&s;efulne&s;s and tendency even of that, till in due time the &s;cheme unfolds, and is account|ed for by &s;ucceeding events. That many points contained in holy Scripture are remote from the common apprehen&s;ions of Mankind, cannot be de|nied.

I never dur&s;t make my own ob&s;ervation or experience, the rule and mea&s;ure of things &s;piritual, &s;upernatural, or relating to another World, becau&s;e I &s;hou'd think it a very bad one, even for the vi&s;ible and natural things of this; It wou'd be judging like the <HI>Si|ame&s;e,</HI> who was po&s;itive it did not freeze in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> becau&s;e he had never known &s;uch a thing as hard water or ice in his own Country.

<P>This great Man is a Philo&s;opher by fire, who has made many proce&s;&s;es upon vegetables. It is his opinion that Men and Vegetables are really of the &s;ame &s;pecies; that Animals are moving Vege|tables, and Vegetables fixed Animals; that the mouths of the one and the roots of the other &s;erve to the &s;ame u&s;e, differing only in po&s;ition; that blo&s;&s;oms and flowers an&s;wer to the mo&s;t indecent and concealed parts in the humane body; that ve|getable and animal bodies are both alike organized, and that in both there is Life or a certain motion and circulation of juices through proper Tubes or Ve&s;&s;els. I &s;hall never forget this able Man's unfold|ing the nature of the Soul in the following manner. The Soul, &s;aid he, is that &s;pecific form or prin|ciple from whence proceed the di&s;tinct qualities or properties of things. Now, as Vegetables are a more &s;imple and le&s;s perfect compound, and con|&s;equently more ea&s;ily analy&s;ed than Animals, we will begin with the contemplation of the Souls of Vegetables. Know then, that the Soul of any Plant, Ro&s;emary for in&s;tance, is neither more nor le&s;s than its e&s;&s;ential Oil. Upon this depends its pe|culiar
<PB N="35" REF="42">
fragrance, ta&s;te, and medicinal virtues, or in other words its life and operations. Separate or extract this e&s;&s;ential Oil by Chymic art, and you get the Soul of the Plant: what remains being a dead Carca&s;e, without any one property or virtue of the Plant, which is pre&s;erved entire in the Oil, a Drachm whereof goes further than &s;everal pounds of the Plant. Now this &s;ame e&s;&s;ential Oil is it &s;elf a compo&s;ition of Sulphur and Salt, or of a gro&s;s unctuous &s;ub&s;tance, and a fine &s;ubtile prin|ciple or volatile Salt impri&s;oned therein. This volatile Salt is properly the e&s;&s;ence of the Soul of the Plant, containing all its virtue, and the Oil is the vehicle of this mo&s;t &s;ubtile part of the Soul, or that which fixes and individuates it. And as, upon &s;eparation of this Oil from the Plant, the Plant died, &s;o a &s;econd death or death of the Soul en&s;ues upon the re&s;olution of this e&s;&s;ential Oil into its prin|ciples; as appears by leaving it expo&s;ed for &s;ome time to the open air, &s;o that the volatile Salt or Spirit may fly off; after which the Oil remains dead and in&s;ipid, but without any &s;en&s;ible diminu|tion of its weight, by the lo&s;s of that volatile e&s;|&s;ence of the Soul, that aethereal aura, that &s;park of entity, which returns and mixes with the Solar light, the univer&s;al Soul of the World, and only &s;ource of Life, whether Vegetable, Animal, or Intellectual; which differ only according to the gro&s;sne&s;s or finene&s;s of the vehicles, and the different textures of the natural Alembics, or in other words, the organized Bodies, where the abovementioned volatile e&s;&s;ence inhabits and is elaborated, where it acts and is acted upon. This Chymical Sy&s;tem lets you at once into the nature of the Soul, and accounts for all it's phaenomena. In that compound which is called Man, the Soul or e&s;&s;ential Oil is what commonly goes by the name of Animal Spirit: for you mu&s;t know, it is a point agreed by Chymi&s;ts, that
<PB N="36" REF="43">
Spirits are nothing but the more &s;ubtile Oils. Now in proportion, as the e&s;&s;ential Oil of Man is more &s;ubtile than that of other Creatures, the volatile Salt that impregnates it is more at liberty to act, which accounts for tho&s;e &s;pe|cifick properties and actions of Humane Kind, which di&s;tingui&s;h them above other Creatures. Hence you may learn why among the wi&s;e ancients, Salt was another name for wit, and in our times a dull Man is &s;aid to be in&s;ipid or in&s;ul&s;e. Aromatic Oils maturated by great length of time turn to Salts: this &s;hews why Humane Kind, grow wi&s;er by age. And what I have &s;aid of the twofold death or di&s;&s;olution, fir&s;t of the compound, by &s;e|parating the Soul from the organical Body, and &s;e|condly of the Soul it &s;elf, by dividing the volatile Salt from the Oil, illu&s;trates and explains that no|tion of certain ancient Philo&s;ophers: that as the Man was a compound of &s;oul and body, &s;o the Soul was compounded of the mind or intellect, and its aethereal vehicle; and that the &s;eparation of Soul and Body or death of the Man is, after a long tract of time, &s;ucceeded by a &s;econd death of the Soul it &s;elf, to wit the &s;eparation or delive|rance of the intellect from its vehicle, and reunion with the Sun. <HI>EUPH.</HI> O <HI>Ly&s;icles</HI> your ingeni|ous friend has opened a new Scene, and explained the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and difficult points in the cleare&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t manner. <HI>LYS.</HI> I mu&s;t own this account of things &s;truck my fancy. I am no great lover of Creeds or Sy&s;tems; but when a notion is rea&s;onable and grounded on experience I know how to value it. <HI>CRI.</HI> In good earne&s;t, <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> do you believe this account to be true? <HI>LYS.</HI> Why then in good earne&s;t I don't know whether I do or no.

Men are too apt to reduce unknown things to the &s;tandard of what they know, and bring a prejudice or tincture from things they have been conver&s;ant in, to judge there|by of things in which they have not been conver|&s;ant. I have known a Fidler gravely teach that the Soul was Harmony; a Geometrician very po|&s;itive that the Soul mu&s;t be extended; and a Phy|&s;ician, who having pickled half a doozen embryos and di&s;&s;ected as many Rats and Frogs, grew con|ceited and affirmed there was no Soul at all, and that it was a vulgar error. <HI>LYS.</HI> My notions &s;it ea&s;y.

<P>It is an allowed point that no Man can judge of this or that part of a machine taken by it &s;elf, without knowing the whole, the mutual relation or dependence of its parts, and the end for which it was made. And, as this is a point acknowledged in corporeal and natural things, ought we not by a parity of rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pend our
<PB N="40" REF="47">
judgment of a &s;ingle unaccountable part of the Di|vine Oeconomy, till we are more fully acquainted with the moral Sy&s;tem, or world of Spirits, and are let into the de&s;igns of God's Providence, and have an exten&s;ive view of his di&s;pen&s;ations pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and future? Alas! <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI> what do you know even of your &s;elf, whence you come, what you are, or whither you are going? To me it &s;eems, that a Minute Philo&s;opher is like a conceit|ed Spectator, who never looked behind the Scenes, and yet wou'd judge of the machinery; who from a tran&s;ient glimp&s;e of a part only of &s;ome one &s;cene, wou'd take upon him to cen&s;ure the plot of a Play. <HI>LYS.</HI> As to the plot I won't &s;ay; but in half a Scene a Man may judge of an ab&s;urd Ac|tor.

But what will you infer from thence? Can you prove it impo&s;&s;ible, that a weak or &s;inful Man &s;hou'd become an in&s;trument to the Spirit of God, for conveying his purpo&s;e to other Sinners? Or that Divine Light may not, as well as the light of the Sun, &s;hine on a foul ve&s;&s;el with|out polluting its rays? <HI>LYS.</HI> To make &s;hort work, the right way wou'd be to put out our eyes, and not judge at all. <HI>CRI.</HI> I do not &s;ay &s;o, but I think it wou'd be right, if &s;ome &s;anguine per&s;ons upon certain points &s;u&s;pected their own judgment. <HI>ALC.</HI> But the very things &s;aid to be in&s;pired,
<PB N="41" REF="48">
taken by them&s;elves and in their own nature, are &s;ometimes &s;o wrong, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, that a Man may pronounce them not to be divine at fir&s;t &s;ight; without troubling his head about the Sy&s;tem of Providence or Connexion of Events: As one may &s;ay that Gra&s;s is green, without knowing or con&s;i|dering how it grows, what u&s;es it is &s;ub&s;ervient to, or how it is connected with the mundane Sy&s;tem.

Man, who has not &s;uch right over his fellow-creatures, who is him&s;elf a fellow-&s;inner with them, who is liable to error as well as pa&s;&s;ion, who&s;e views are imperfect, who is governed more by Prejudice, than the Truth of things, may not improbably deceive him&s;elf, when he &s;ets up for a judge of the proceedings of the holy, omni&s;cient, impa&s;&s;ive Creator and Governor of all things.</P>

A Child is influenced by the many &s;en&s;ible effects it hath felt, of paternal love and care and &s;uperior wi&s;dom, to believe and do &s;everal things with an implicit faith and obe|dience: And if we in the &s;ame manner, from the truth and rea&s;onablene&s;s which we plainly &s;ee in &s;o many points within our cogni&s;ance, and the advantages which we experience from the &s;eed of the Go&s;pel &s;own in good ground, were di&s;po&s;ed to an implicit Belief of certain other points, re|lating to &s;chemes we do not know, or &s;ubjects to which our Talents are perhaps di&s;proportionate, I am tempted to think it might become our duty without di&s;honouring our Rea&s;on; which is never &s;o much di&s;honoured as when it is foiled, and never in more danger of being foiled, than by judging where it hath neither means nor right to judge. <HI>LYS.</HI> I wou'd give a good deal, to &s;ee that ingenious Game&s;ter <HI>Glaucus</HI> have the handling of <HI>Euphranor</HI> one night at our Club.

for Mankind to have known all parts of the Chri&s;tian Religion, be&s;ides my&s;teries and po&s;itive in&s;titutions, is not the que&s;tion between us; and that they actually did not know them, is too plain to be denied.

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> But whatever may be pretended as to ob&s;cure Doctrines and Di&s;pen&s;ations, all this hath nothing to do with Prophecies, which, being altogether relative to Mankind, and the events of this World, to which our faculties are &s;urely well enough proportioned, one might expect &s;hou'd be very clear, and &s;uch as might inform in&s;tead of puzzling us. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And yet it mu&s;t be al|lowed that as &s;ome Prophecies are clear, there are others very ob&s;cure; but left to my &s;elf, I doubt I &s;hou'd never have inferred from thence that they were not Divine. In my own way of thinking I &s;hou'd have been apt to conclude, that the Prophe|cies we under&s;tand are a proof for In&s;piration; but that tho&s;e we do not under&s;tand are no proof again&s;t it. Ina&s;much as for the latter our ignorance or the re&s;erve of the Holy Spirit may account, but for the other nothing, for ought that I &s;ee, can account but In&s;piration. <HI>ALC.</HI> Now I know &s;everal &s;a|gacious Men, who conclude very differently from you, to wit, that the one &s;ort of Prophecies are non&s;en&s;e, and the other contrived after the events.

To me it is &s;ufficient, that the point it &s;elf is odd and out of the road of nature. For the re&s;t, I leave them to di&s;pute and &s;ettle among them&s;elves, where to fix the preci&s;e time when the Scepter departed from <HI>Judah;</HI> or whether in <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Prophecy of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> we &s;hou'd com|pute by the <HI>Chaldaean</HI> or the <HI>Julian</HI> year.

I can without a|mazement meet in Holy Scripture divers Prophe|cies, whereof I do not &s;ee the completion, divers texts I do not under&s;tand, divers my&s;teries above my comprehen&s;ion, and ways of God to me unac|countable. Why may not &s;ome Prophecies relate to parts of Hi&s;tory I am not well enough acquainted with, or to events not yet come to pa&s;s? It &s;eems to me that Prophecies unfathomed by the hearer, or even the &s;peaker him&s;elf, have been afterward verified and under&s;tood in the event; and it is one of my maxims, That, <HI>what hath been may be.</HI> Though I rub my Eyes, and do my utmo&s;t to ex|tricate my &s;elf from prejudice, yet it &s;till &s;eems very po&s;&s;ible to me, that, what I do not, a more acute, more attentive, or more learned Man may under&s;tand: At lea&s;t thus much is plain; the dif|ficulty of &s;ome points or pa&s;&s;ages doth not hinder the clearne&s;s of others, and tho&s;e parts of Scripture, which we cannot interpret, we are not bound to know the &s;en&s;e of.

for tho&s;e things which it doth not belong to us to account for? Scriptures not under&s;tood, at one time, or by one per&s;on, may be under&s;tood at ano|ther time, or by other per&s;ons.

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> Well, <HI>Euphranor,</HI> I will lend you a helping hand, &s;ince you de&s;ire it, but think fit to alter my method: For you mu&s;t know, the main points of Chri&s;tian Belief have been infu&s;ed &s;o early, and inculcated &s;o often, by nur&s;es, paeda|gogues, and prie&s;ts, that, be the proofs ever &s;o plain, it is a hard matter to convince a mind, thus tinctured and &s;tained, by arguing again&s;t revealed Religion from its internal characters. I &s;hall there|fore &s;et my &s;elf to con&s;ider things in another light, and examine your Religion by certain external characters or circum&s;tantials, comparing the &s;y&s;tem of Revelation with collateral accounts of ancient Heathen writers, and &s;hewing how ill it con&s;i&s;ts with them.

It is ob&s;ervable, I &s;ay, that &s;peaking of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> his expre&s;&s;ion is, who was called the Chri&s;t, not who pretended to be the Chri&s;t, or who was fal&s;ly called the Chri&s;t, but &s;imply <GAP DESC="foreign"> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;.

It is evident <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> knew there was &s;uch a Man as <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and that he was &s;aid to be the Chri&s;t, and yet he condemns neither him nor his followers; which to me &s;eems an Argument in their favour. Certainly if we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> to have known or been per&s;uaded that he was an Impo&s;tor, it will be difficult to account for his not &s;aying &s;o in plain terms. But if we &s;uppo&s;e him in <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s way of thinking, who &s;u&s;pended his judgment, and was afraid of being found to fight again&s;t God, it &s;hou'd &s;eem natural for him to behave in that very man|ner, which according to you makes again&s;t our Faith, but I verily think makes for it. But what if <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> had been a Bigot, or even a <HI>Sadducee,</HI> an Infidel, an Athei&s;t? What then! we readily grant there might have been Per&s;ons of Rank, Po|liticians, Generals, and Men of Letters, then as well as now, <HI>Jews</HI> as well as <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> who be|lieved no revealed Religion: And that &s;ome &s;uch per&s;ons might po&s;&s;ibly have heard of a man in low life, who performed miracles by Magic, without informing them&s;elves, or perhaps ever inquiring, about his Mi&s;&s;ion and Doctrine.

again&s;t the Truth of the Go&s;pel, from <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>'s omitting to &s;peak of it, any more than from his omitting to embrace it.

You have then the &s;uffrages of both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> atte&s;ting to the Truth of our Religion in the earlie&s;t ages.

But will that hinder you from admitting, there are many good rules and ju&s;t notions, and u&s;eful truths in all tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. Phy&s;icians may di&s;|pute, perhaps vainly and unintelligibly, about the Animal Sy&s;tem: they may a&s;&s;ign different cau&s;es of Di&s;tempers, &s;ome explaining them by the ele|mentary qualities, hot and cold, moi&s;t and dry, yet this doth not hinder, but the Bark may be good for an Ague, and Rhubarb for a Flux. Nor can it others by chymical, others by mechanical principles, be inferred from the different &s;ects, which from time to time have &s;prung up in that profe&s;&s;ion, the Dogmatic, for in&s;tance, Empiric, Methodic, Galenic, Paracel&s;ian, or the hard words and knot|ty que&s;tions and idle theories which have grown from them, or been engrafted on them, that, there|fore, we &s;hou'd deny the Circulation of the Blood, or reject their excellent rules about Exerci&s;e, Air, and Diet. <HI>ALC.</HI> It &s;eems you wou'd &s;creen Re|ligion by the example of other profe&s;&s;ions, all which have produced Sects and Di&s;putes as well as Chri&s;|tianity, which may in it&s;elf be true and u&s;eful, not|with&s;tanding many fal&s;e and fruitle&s;s Notions en|grafted on it by the wit of Man.

<P>But to return: what or where is the profe&s;&s;ion of Men, who never &s;plit into &s;chi&s;ms, or never talk non&s;en&s;e? Is it not evident, that out of all the kinds of knowledge, on which the Humane mind is employ'd, there grow certain ex|cre&s;cences, which may be pared off, like the clip|pings of hair or nails in the body, and with no wor&s;e con&s;equence. Whatever Bigots or Enthu|&s;ia&s;ts, whatever notional or &s;chola&s;tic Divines may &s;ay or think, it is certain the Faith derived from Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, was not a piece of empty Sophi&s;try; they did not deliver and tran&s;mit down to us <GAP DESC="foreign"> but <GAP DESC="foreign">, to u&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of a holy Confe&s;&s;or <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Socr.

And, to pretend to demoli&s;h their foundation for the &s;ake of Hu|mane Super&s;tructure, be it hay or &s;tubble or what it will, is no Argument of ju&s;t thought or rea&s;on; any more than it is of fairne&s;s, to &s;uppo&s;e a doubt|ful &s;en&s;e fixed, and argue from one &s;ide of the que&s;|tion in di&s;puted points. Whether, for in&s;tance, the beginning of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> is to be under&s;tood in a literal or allegorical &s;en&s;e? Whether the Book of <HI>Job</HI> be an Hi&s;tory or a Parable? Being points di&s;|puted between Chri&s;tians, an Infidel can have no right to argue from one &s;ide of the Que&s;tion, in tho&s;e or the like ca&s;es. This or that Tenet of a Sect, this or that contraverted Notion is not what we contend for at pre&s;ent, but the general Faith taught by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and pre&s;erved by univer&s;al and perpetual Tradition in all the Churches down to our own times. To tax or &s;trike at this Divine Doctrine, on account of things foreign and adventitious, the &s;peculations and di&s;putes of curious Men, is in my mind an ab&s;urdity of the &s;ame kind, as it wou'd be to cut down a fine tree yielding Fruit and Shade, becau&s;e its leaves afforded

Why do men &s;ingle out &s;uch points as are innocent and u&s;eful, when there are &s;o many pernicious mi&s;takes to be amended? Why &s;et them&s;elves to de&s;troy the hopes of Humane Kind and encouragements to Virtue? Why delight to judge where they di&s;dain to inquire?

<P>There is, indeed, a deal of &s;pecious talk about Faith founded upon Miracles; but when I examine this matter throughly, and trace Chri&s;|tian Faith up to its original, I find it re&s;ts upon much darkne&s;s and &s;cruple and uncertainty. In&s;tead of points evident or agreeable to Humane Rea&s;on, I find a wonderful narrative of the Son of God tempted in the wilderne&s;s by the Devil, a thing utterly unaccountable, without any end, or u&s;e or rea&s;on what&s;oever. I meet with &s;trange Hi&s;tories of Apparitions of Angels and Voices from Heaven, with &s;urpri&s;ing accounts of Daemoniacs, things quite out of the road of common Sen&s;e or Ob&s;ervation, with &s;everal incredible feats &s;aid to have been done by Divine Power, but more probably the Inventions of Men; nor the le&s;s likely to be &s;o, becau&s;e I cannot pretend to &s;ay with what view they were invented. Di&s;igns deeply laid are dark, and the le&s;s we know the more we &s;u&s;pect: But, admit|ting them for true, I &s;hall not allow them to be miraculous, until I thoroughly know the power of what are called &s;econd cau&s;es and the force of Ma|gic. <HI>CRI.</HI> You &s;eem, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> to analy&s;e, not Faith, but Infidelity, and trace it to its Principles; which, from your own account, I collect to be dark and doubtful &s;cruples and &s;urmi&s;es, ha&s;tine&s;s in judging, and narrowne&s;s in thinking, grounded on a fanciful notion which over-rates the little &s;cant|ling of your own Experience, and on real ignorance of the views of Providence, and of the qualities, operations, and mutual re&s;pects of the &s;everal kinds of beings, which are, or may be, for ought you know, in the Univer&s;e. Thus ob&s;cure, uncertain, conceited, and conjectural are the Principles of In|fidelity. Whereas on the other hand, the Principles of Faith &s;eem to be points plain and clear. It is a clear point, that this Faith in Chri&s;t was &s;pread
<PB N="75" REF="82">
abroad throughout the world &s;oon after his death. It is a clear point, that this was not effected by humane Learning, Politics, or Power. It is a clear point, that in the early times of the Church there were &s;everal men of Knowledge and Integrity, who embraced this Faith not from any, but again&s;t all, temporal motives. It is a clear point, that, the nearer they were to the fountain-head, the more opportunity they had to &s;atisfy them&s;elves, as to the Truth of the&s;e facts which they believed. It is a clear point, that the le&s;s intere&s;t there was to per&s;uade, the more need there was of Evidence to convince them. It is a clear point, that they relied on the Authority of tho&s;e who declared them&s;elves Eye-witne&s;&s;es of the Miracles and Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t. It is a clear point, that tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ed Eye-witne&s;&s;es &s;uffered much for this their Atte&s;ta|tion, and finally &s;ealed it with their Blood. It is a clear point, that the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, weak and con|temptible as they were, overcame the world, &s;pread more light, preached purer morals, and did more benefit to Mankind, than all the Philo&s;ophers and Sages put together. The&s;e points appear to me clear and &s;ure, and, being allow'd &s;uch, they are plain, ju&s;t, and rea&s;onable motives of a&s;&s;ent; they &s;tand upon no fallacious ground, they contain no|thing beyond our &s;phere, neither &s;uppo&s;ing more knowledge nor other faculties than we are really ma&s;ters of; and if they &s;hou'd not be admitted for morally certain, as I believe they will by fair and unprejudiced Inquirers, yet the allowing them to be only probable is &s;ufficient to &s;top the mouth of an Infidel. The&s;e plain points, I &s;ay, are the Pillars of our Faith, and not tho&s;e ob&s;cure ones by you &s;uppo&s;ed, which are in truth the un&s;ound, uncer|tain Principles of Infidelity, to a ra&s;h, prejudiced, and a&s;&s;uming Spirit. To rai&s;e an Argument, or an&s;wer an objection, from hidden powers of Nature
<PB N="76" REF="83">
or Magic is groping in the dark; but by the evident light of &s;en&s;e men might be &s;ufficiently certified of &s;en&s;ible Effects, and matters of Fact, &s;uch as the Miracles and Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t: and the Te&s;timony of &s;uch Men may be tran&s;mitted to After-ages, with the &s;ame moral certainty as other Hi&s;to|rical Narrations: and tho&s;e &s;ame miraculous Facts, compared by Rea&s;on with the Doctrines they were brought to prove, do afford to an unbia&s;&s;ed mind &s;trong Indications of their coming from God, or a &s;uperior Principle, who&s;e Goodne&s;s retrieved the Moral World, who&s;e Power commanded the Na|tural, and who&s;e Providence extended over both. Give me leave to &s;ay, that nothing dark, nothing incomprehen&s;ible, or my&s;terious, or unaccountable, is the ground or motive, the principle or founda|tion, the proof or rea&s;on of our Faith, although it may be the object of it. For it mu&s;t be owned, that, if by clear and &s;ure principles we are ratio|nally led to believe a point le&s;s clear, we do not therefore reject &s;uch point, becau&s;e it is my&s;terious to conceive, or difficult to account for, nor wou'd it be right &s;o to do. As for <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> an|ciently attributing our Saviour's Miracles to Magic, this is &s;o far from being a proof again&s;t them, that to me it &s;eems rather a Proof of the Facts, with|out di&s;proving the Cau&s;e to which we a&s;cribe them, As we do not pretend to know the Nature and Operations of Daemons, the Hi&s;tory, Laws, and Sy&s;tem of rational Beings, and the Schemes or Views of Providence, &s;o far as to account for every action and appearance recorded in the Go&s;pel; &s;o neither do you know enough of tho&s;e things, to be able from that Knowledge of yours to object a|gain&s;t Accounts &s;o well atte&s;ted. It is an ea&s;y matter to rai&s;e Scruples upon many authentic parts of Civil Hi&s;tory, which, requiring a more perfect knowledge of Facts, Circum&s;tances, and Councils,
<PB N="77" REF="84">
than we can come at to explain them, mu&s;t be to us inexplicable. And this is &s;till more ea&s;y with re&s;pect to the Hi&s;tory of Nature, in which, if Surmi&s;es were admitted for Proofs again&s;t things odd, &s;trange, and unaccountable, if our &s;canty Ex|perience were made the rule and mea&s;ure of Truth, and all tho&s;e Phaenomena rejected, that we, through ignorance of the Principles, and Laws, and Sy&s;tem of Nature, cou'd not explain, we &s;hou'd indeed make Di&s;coveries, but it wou'd be only of our own Blindne&s;s and Pre&s;umption. And why Men that are &s;o ea&s;ily and &s;o often gravell'd in common Points, in things natural and vi&s;ible, &s;hou'd yet be &s;o &s;harp|&s;ighted and dogmatical about the invi&s;ible World, and its My&s;teries, is to me a point utterly unac|countable by all the Rules of Logic and good Sen&s;e. Upon the whole, therefore, I cannot help thinking there are Points &s;ufficiently plain, and clear, and full, whereon a Man may ground a rea&s;onable Faith in Chri&s;t: but that the attacks of Minute Philo&s;ophers again&s;t this faith are grounded upon Darkne&s;s, Ignorance, and Pre&s;umption. <HI>ALC.</HI> I doubt I &s;hall &s;till remain in the dark as to the Proofs of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and always pre|&s;ume there is nothing in them.</P>

be unchangeable, and the &s;ame in its eternal Source, the Father of Lights: Yet, with re&s;pect to us, it is variou&s;ly weakened and ob&s;cured, by pa&s;&s;ing through a long Di&s;tance or gro&s;s Medium, where it is intercepted, di&s;torted, or tinctured by the Prejudices and Pa&s;&s;ions of Men. But all this not|with&s;tanding, he that will u&s;e his Eyes may &s;ee enough for the purpo&s;es either of Nature, or of Grace; though by a light, dimmer indeed, or clear|er, according to the Place, or the Di&s;tance, or the Hour, or the Medium. And it will be &s;ufficient, if &s;uch Analogy appears between the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Grace and Nature, as may make it probable (al|though much &s;hou'd be unaccountable in both) to &s;uppo&s;e them derived from the &s;ame Author, and the workman&s;hip of one and the &s;ame Hand. <HI>ALC.</HI> Tho&s;e who &s;aw and touched and handled <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> after his Re&s;urrection, if there were any &s;uch, may be &s;aid to have &s;een by a clear Light: But to us the Light is very dim, and yet it is expected we &s;hou'd believe this Point as well as they. For my part, I believe, with <HI>Spino&s;a,</HI> that Chri&s;t's Death was Literal, but his Re&s;urrection Allegori|cal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Spino&s;ae Epi&s;t. ad Oldenburgium.</NOTE>. <HI>CRI.</HI> And for my part, I can &s;ee nothing in this celebrated Infidel, that &s;hou'd make me de|&s;ert matters of Fact, and moral Evidence, to a|dopt his Notions. Though I mu&s;t needs own I admit an allegorical Re&s;urrection that proves the real, to wit, a Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples from Weakne&s;s to Re&s;olution, from Fear to Cou|rage, from De&s;pair to Hope, of which, for ought I can &s;ee, no rational Account can be given, but the &s;en&s;ible Evidence that our Lord was truly, re|ally, and literally ri&s;en from the dead: But as it cannot be denied that his Di&s;ciples, who were Eye-witne&s;&s;es of his Miracles and Re&s;urrection, had &s;tronger Evidence than we can have of tho&s;e Points:
<PB N="79" REF="86">
So it cannot be denied, that &s;uch Evidence was then more nece&s;&s;ary, to induce Men to embrace a new In&s;titution, contrary to the whole Sy&s;tem of their Education, their Prejudices, their Pa&s;&s;ions, their Intere&s;ts, and every Humane Motive. Though to me it &s;eems, the moral Evidence and probable Arguments within our reach, are abundantly &s;ufficient to make prudent thinking Men adhere to the Faith, handed down to us from our Ance&s;tors, e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by the Laws of our Country, requiring Sub|mi&s;&s;ion in Points above our Knowledge, and for the re&s;t recommending Doctrines the mo&s;t agreea|ble to our Intere&s;t and our Rea&s;on. And, how|ever &s;trong the Light might have been at the Foun|tain-head, yet its long Continuance and Propaga|tion, by &s;uch unpromi&s;ing In&s;truments throughout the World, have been very wonderful. We may now take a more comprehen&s;ive View of the Con|nexion, Order, and Progre&s;s of the divine Di&s;pen|&s;ations, and, by a retro&s;pect on a long Series of pa&s;t Ages, perceive a Unity of De&s;ign running throughout the whole, a gradual di&s;clo&s;ing and fulfilling the purpo&s;es of Providence, a regular Progre&s;s from Types to Antitypes, from things Carnal to things Spiritual, from Earth to Heaven. We may behold Chri&s;t crucified, that &s;tumbling-block to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and fooli&s;hne&s;s to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> putting a final Period to the Temple Wor&s;hip of the one, and the Idolatry of the other, and that Stone, which was cut out of the Mountain with|out Hands, and brake in Pieces all other King|doms, become it &s;elf a great Mountain.</P>

<P>If a due Reflection on the&s;e things be not &s;ufficient to beget a Reverence for the Chri&s;tian Faith in the Minds of Men, I &s;hou'd rather impute it to any other Cau&s;e, than a wi&s;e and cautious In|credulity: When I &s;ee their ea&s;ine&s;s of Faith in the
<PB N="80" REF="87">
common concerns of Life, where there is no Pre|judice or Appetite to bias or di&s;turb their natural Judgment: When I &s;ee tho&s;e very Men that in Religion will not &s;tir a &s;tep without Evidence, and at every turn ex&s;pect Demon&s;tration, tru&s;t their Health to a Phy&s;ician, and their Lives to a Sailor with an implicit Faith, I cannot think they de|&s;erve the honour of being thought more incredu|lous than other Men, or that they are more ac|cu&s;tom'd to know, and for this rea&s;on le&s;s inclined to believe. On the contrary, one is tempted to &s;u&s;pect, that Ignorance hath a greater &s;hare than Science in our modern Infidelity, and that it pro|ceeds more from a wrong Head, or an irregular Will, than from deep Re&s;earches. <HI>LYS.</HI> We do not, it mu&s;t be owned, think that Learning or deep Re&s;earches are nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s right Judg|ments upon things. I &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pect that Learn|ing is apt to produce and ju&s;tify Whims, and &s;in|cerely believe we &s;hou'd do better without it. Our Sect are divided on this Point, but much the greater part think with me. I have heard more than once very ob&s;erving Men remark, that Learn|ing was the true humane Means which pre&s;erved Religion in the World, and that, if we had it in our power to prefer Blockheads in the Church, all wou'd &s;oon be right. <HI>CRI.</HI> Men mu&s;t be &s;trange|ly in love with their Opinions, to put out their Eyes rather than part with them. But it has been often remarked, by ob&s;erving Men that there are no greater Bigots than Infidels. <HI>LYS.</HI> What a Free-thinker and a Bigot, impo&s;&s;ible! <HI>CRI.</HI> Not &s;o impo&s;&s;ible neither, that an Infidel &s;hou'd be bi|goted to his Infidelity. Methinks I &s;ee a Bigot, wherever I &s;ee a Man over-bearing and po&s;itive without knowing why, laying the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s on Points of &s;malle&s;t moment, ha&s;ty to judge of the Con&s;cience, Thoughts, and inward Views of other
<PB N="81" REF="88">
Men, impatient of rea&s;oning again&s;t his own Opi|nions, and choo&s;ing them with Inclination rather than Judgment, an Enemy to Learning, and at|tached to mean Authorities. How far our Mo|dern Infidels agree with this De&s;cription, I leave to be con&s;idered by tho&s;e who really con&s;ider and think for them&s;elves. <HI>LYS.</HI> We are no Bigots, we are Men that di&s;cover Difficulties in Religion, that tie Knots and rai&s;e Scruples, which di&s;turb the Repo&s;e and interrupt the golden Dreams of Bigots, who therefore cannot endure us. <HI>CRI.</HI> They who ca&s;t about for Difficulties, will be &s;ure to find or make them upon every &s;ubject: But he that wou'd, upon the foot of Rea&s;on, erect him&s;elf in|to a Judge, in order to make a wi&s;e Judgment on a Subject of that nature, will not only con&s;ider the doubtful and difficult Parts of it, but take a comprehen&s;ive View of the whole, con&s;ider it in all its Parts and Relations, trace it to its Original, examine its Principles, Effects, and Tendencies, its Proofs internal and external; he will di&s;tingui&s;h between the clear Points and the ob&s;cure, the cer|tain and the uncertain, the e&s;&s;ential and circum|&s;tantial, between what is genuine and what foreign: he will con&s;ider the different &s;orts of Proof, that belong to different things, where Evidence is to be expected, where Probability may &s;uffice, and where it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e there &s;hou'd be Doubts and Scruples: He will proportion his Pains and Exactne&s;s to the Importance of the Inquiry, and check that Di&s;po&s;ition of his Mind to conclude all tho&s;e Notions, groundle&s;s Prejudices, with which it was imbued before it knew the Rea&s;on of them. He will &s;ilence his Pa&s;&s;ions, and li&s;ten to Truth: He will endeavour to untie Knots as well as to tie them, and dwell rather on the light parts of things than the ob&s;cure: He will balance the force of his Under&s;tanding with the difficulty of the
<PB N="82" REF="89">
Subject, and to render his Judgment impartial, hear Evidence on all &s;ides, and, &s;o far as he is led by Authority, choo&s;e to follow that of the hone&s;t|e&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Men. Now it is my &s;incere Opinion, the Chri&s;tian Religion may well &s;tand the Te&s;t of &s;uch an Inquiry. <HI>LYS.</HI> But &s;uch an Inquiry wou'd co&s;t too much Pains and Time. We have thought of another Method, the bringing Religion to the Te&s;t of Wit and Humour: This we find a much &s;horter, ea&s;ier, and more effectual Way. And as all Enemies are at liberty to choo&s;e their Weapons, we make choice of tho&s;e we are mo&s;t expert at: And we are the better plea&s;ed with this Choice, having ob&s;erved that of all things a &s;olid Divine hates a Je&s;t. To con&s;ider the whole of the Subject, to read and think on all &s;ides, to object plainly, and an&s;wer directly, upon the foot of dry Rea&s;on and Argument, wou'd be a very tedious and trouble|&s;ome Affair. Be&s;ides it is attacking Pedants at their own Weapons. How much more delicate and artful is it, to give a hint, to cover one's &s;elf with an Aenigma, to drop a <HI>double Entendre,</HI> to keep it in one's Power to recover, and &s;lip a&s;ide, and leave his Antagoni&s;t beating the Air? This hath been practi&s;ed with great Succe&s;s, and I be|lieve it the top Method to gain Pro&s;elytes, and con|found Pedants. <HI>CRI.</HI> I have &s;een &s;everal things written in this way, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, were copi|ed from the Behaviour of a &s;ly &s;ort of Scorners one may &s;ometimes meet with. Suppo&s;e a con|ceited Man that wou'd pa&s;s for witty, tipping the Wink upon one, thru&s;ting out his Tongue at ano|ther; one while waggi&s;hly &s;miling, another with a grave Mouth and ludicrous Eyes; often affecting the Countenance of one who &s;mother'd a Je&s;t, and &s;ometimes bur&s;ting out in a Hor&s;e-laugh: What a Figure wou'd this be, I will not &s;ay in the Senate or Council, but in a private Vi&s;it among

well-bred Men? And yet this is the Figure that certain great Authors, who in this Age wou'd pa&s;s for Models, and do pa&s;s for Models, make in their polite and elaborate Writings on the mo&s;t weighty Points. <HI>ALC.</HI> I who profe&s;s my &s;elf an Admirer, an Adorer of Rea&s;on, am obliged to own, that in &s;ome Ca&s;es the Sharpne&s;s of Ridicule can do more than the Strength of Argument. But if we exert our &s;elves in the u&s;e of Mirth and Hu|mour, it is not for want of other Weapons. It &s;hall never be &s;aid that a Free-thinker was afraid of Rea&s;oning.

<P>_THE Philo&s;ophers having re&s;olved to &s;et out for <HI>London</HI> next Morning, we a&s;&s;embled at break of day in the Li|brary. <HI>Alciphron</HI> began with a De|claration of his Sincerity, a&s;&s;uring us he had very maturely and with a mo&s;t unbia&s;&s;ed Mind con&s;idered all that had been &s;aid the day be|fore. He added that upon the whole he cou'd not deny &s;everal probable Rea&s;ons were produced for embracing the Chri&s;tian Faith. But, &s;aid he, tho&s;e Rea&s;ons being only probable can never pre|vail again&s;t ab&s;olute Certainty and Demon&s;tration. If therefore I can demon&s;trate your Religion to be a thing altogether ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent, your probable Arguments in its defence do from that Moment lo&s;e their Force, and with it all Right to be an&s;wer'd or con&s;idered. The concurring Te&s;timony of &s;incere and able Witne&s;&s;es hath with|out que&s;tion great weight in humane Affairs. I will even grant that things odd and unaccountable to Humane Judgment or Experience, may &s;ometimes claim our A&s;&s;ent on that &s;ole Motive. And I will al&s;o grant it po&s;&s;ible, for a Tradition to be con|vey'd with moral Evidence through many Centu|ries. But at the &s;ame time you will grant to me, that a thing demon&s;trably and palpably fal&s;e is not to be admitted on any Te&s;timony whatever, which
<PB N="86" REF="93">
at be&s;t can never amount to Demon&s;tration. To be plain, no Te&s;timony can make Non&s;en&s;e Sen&s;e; no moral Evidence can make Contradictions con&s;i|&s;tent. Know then, that as the Strength of our Cau&s;e doth not depend upon, &s;o neither is it to be decided by any critical Points of Hi&s;tory, Chro|nology, or Languages. You are not to wonder, if the &s;ame &s;ort of Tradition and moral Proof, which governs our A&s;&s;ent with re&s;pect to Facts in civil or natural Hi&s;tory, is not admitted as a &s;ufficient Voucher for metaphy&s;ical Ab&s;urdities and ab&s;olute Impo&s;&s;ibilities. Things ob&s;cure and unaccounta|ble in humane Affairs, or the Operations of Na|ture, may yet be po&s;&s;ible, and, if well atte&s;ted, may be a&s;&s;ented unto: But religious A&s;&s;ent or Faith can be evidently &s;hewn in its own nature to be impracticable, impo&s;&s;ible, and ab&s;urd. This is the primary Motive to Infidelity. This is our Citadel and Fortre&s;s, which may, indeed, be gra|ced with outworks of various Erudition, but, if tho&s;e are demoli&s;hed, remains in it &s;elf and of its own proper Strength impregnable. <HI>EUPH.</HI> This, it mu&s;t be owned, reduceth our Inquiry within a narrow Compa&s;s: Do but make out this, and I &s;hall have nothing more to &s;ay. <HI>ALC.</HI> Know then, that the &s;hallow Mind of the Vulgar, as it dwells only on the outward Surface of things, and con&s;iders them in the gro&s;s, may be ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on. Hence a blind Reverence for Religious Faith and My&s;tery. But when an acute Philo&s;opher comes to di&s;&s;ect and analy&s;e the&s;e Points, the Im|po&s;ture plainly appears: And as he has no Blind|ne&s;s, &s;o he has no Reverence for empty Notions, or, to &s;peak more properly, for meer Forms of Speech, which mean nothing, and are of no u&s;e to Mankind.</P>

<P>Words are Signs: They do or &s;hou'd &s;tand for Ideas; which &s;o far as they &s;ugge&s;t they are &s;ig|nificant. But words that &s;ugge&s;t no Ideas are in&s;ig|nificant. He who annexeth a clear Idea to every Word he makes u&s;e of &s;peaks Sen&s;e; but where &s;uch Ideas are wanting, the Speaker utters Non|&s;en&s;e. In order therefore to know whether any Man's Speech be &s;en&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant, we have nothing to do but lay a&s;ide the Words and con&s;ider the Ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by them. Men, not being able immediately to communicate their Ideas one to another, are obliged to make u&s;e of &s;en&s;ible Signs or Words; the u&s;e of which is to rai&s;e tho&s;e Ideas in the Hearer, which are in the Mind of the Speaker: And if they fail of this End they &s;erve to no Purpo&s;e. He who really thinks hath a train of Ideas &s;ucceeding each other and connected in his Mind: And when he expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf by Di&s;|cour&s;e, each Word &s;ugge&s;ts a di&s;tinct Idea to the Hearer or Reader; who by that means hath the &s;ame train of Ideas in his, which was in the Mind of the Speaker or Writer. As far as this Effect is produced, &s;o far the Di&s;cour&s;e is intelligible, hath &s;en&s;e and meaning. Hence it follows, that whoe|ver can be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand what he reads or hears mu&s;t have a train of Ideas rai&s;ed in his Mind, corre&s;pondent to the train of Words read or heard. The&s;e plain Truths, to which Men rea|dily a&s;&s;ent in Theory, are but little attended to in Practice, and therefore de&s;erve to be enlarged on and inculcated however obvious and undeniable. Mankind are generally aver&s;e from thinking though apt enought to entertain Di&s;cour&s;e either in them|&s;elves or others: the Effect whereof is, that their Minds are rather &s;tored with Names than Ideas, the husk of Science rather than the thing. And yet the&s;e Words without meaning do often make Di&s;tinctions of Parties, the Subject matter of their
<PB N="88" REF="95">
Di&s;putes, and the Object of their Zeal. This is the mo&s;t general Cau&s;e of Error, which doth not influence ordinary Minds alone, but even tho&s;e who pa&s;s for acute and learned Philo&s;ophers are often employ'd about Names in&s;tead of Things or Ideas, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to know when they only pronounce hard Words without a meaning.</P>

<P>Though it is evident that as Knowledge is the Perception of the Connexion or Di&s;agreement between Ideas, he who doth not di&s;tinctly perceive the Ideas marked by the terms, &s;o as to form a mental Propo&s;ition an&s;wering to the verbal, can|not po&s;&s;ibly have Knowledge: No more can he be &s;aid to have Opinion or Faith which imply a weak|er A&s;&s;ent, but &s;till it mu&s;t be to a Propo&s;ition, the Terms of which are under&s;tood as clearly, al|though the Agreement or Di&s;agreement of the I|deas may not be &s;o evident, as in the ca&s;e of Know|ledge. I &s;ay, all degrees of A&s;&s;ent whether found|ed on Rea&s;on or Authority, more or le&s;s cogent, are internal Acts of the Mind which alike terminate in Ideas as their proper Object: Without which there can be really no &s;uch thing as Knowledge, Faith, or Opinion. We may perhaps rai&s;e a Du&s;t and Di&s;pute about Tenets purely verbal; but what is this at bottom more than meer trifling? All which will be ea&s;ily admitted with re&s;pect to Humane Learning and Science; wherein it is an allowed Method to expo&s;e any Doctrine or Tenet by &s;tripping them of the Words, and examining what Ideas are underneath, or whether any Ideas at all? This is often found the &s;horte&s;t way to end Di&s;putes, which might otherwi&s;e grow and multi|ply without end, the Litigants neither under&s;tanding one another nor them&s;elves. It were needle&s;s to illu&s;trate what &s;hines by its own Light, and is ad|mitted by all thinking Men. My endeavour &s;hall
<PB N="89" REF="96">
be only to apply it in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. I &s;uppo&s;e I need not be at any pains to prove, that the &s;ame Rules of Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e which obtain in all other Subjects ought to take place in Religion. As for tho&s;e who con&s;ider Faith and Rea&s;on as two di&s;tinct Provinces, and wou'd have us think good Sen&s;e has nothing to do where it is mo&s;t con|cerned, I am re&s;olved never to argue with &s;uch Men, but leave them in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Prejudices. And now, for the particular Appli|cation of what I have &s;aid, I &s;hall not &s;ingle out a|ny nice di&s;puted Points of School Divinity, or tho&s;e that relate to the Nature and E&s;&s;ence of God, which being allow'd infinite you might pretend to &s;creen them, under the general Notion of Difficul|ties attending the Nature of Infinity.</P>

<P>Grace is the main Point in the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, nothing is oftener mentioned or more con&s;idered throughout the New Te&s;tament; where|in it is repre&s;ented as &s;omewhat of a very particu|lar kind, di&s;tinct from any thing revealed to the <HI>Jews,</HI> or known by the light of Nature. This &s;ame Grace is &s;poken of as the Gift of God, as coming by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as reigning, as abounding, as o|perating. Men are &s;aid to &s;peak through Grace, to believe through Grace. Mention is made of the Glory of Grace, the Riches of Grace, the Stew|ards of Grace. Chri&s;tians are &s;aid to be Heirs of Grace, to receive Grace, grow in Grace, be &s;trong in Grace, to &s;tand in Grace, and to fall from Grace. And la&s;tly, Grace is &s;aid to ju&s;tify and to &s;ave them. Hence Chri&s;tianity is &s;tyled the Covenant of Di&s;pen&s;ation of Grace. And it is well known that no Point hath created more Controver&s;y in the Church than this Doctrine of Grace. What Di|&s;putes about its Nature, Extent, and Effects, a|bout univer&s;al, efficacious, &s;ufficient, preventing,
<PB N="90" REF="97">
Irri&s;i&s;tible Grace have employ'd the Pens of Pro|te&s;tant as well as Popi&s;h Divines, of Jan&s;eni&s;ts and Molini&s;ts, of Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, and Armi|nians, as I have not the lea&s;t curio&s;ity to know, &s;o I need not &s;ay. It &s;ufficeth to ob&s;erve, that there have been and are &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting great conte&s;ts up|on the&s;e Points. Only one thing I &s;hou'd de&s;ire to be informed of, to wit, what is the clear and di&s;|tinct Idea marked by the Word Grace? I pre&s;ume a Man may know the bare meaning of a Term, without going into the depth of all tho&s;e learned In|quiries. This &s;urely is an ea&s;y Matter, provided there is an Idea annexed to &s;uch Term. And if there is not, it can be neither the &s;ubject of a rati|onal Di&s;pute, nor the Object of real Faith. Men may indeed impo&s;e upon them&s;elves or others, and pretend to argue and believe, when at bottom there is no Argument or Belief, farther than meer verbal trifling. Grace taken in the vulgar Sen&s;e, either for Beauty, or Favour, I can ea&s;ily under|&s;tand. But when it denotes an active, vital, ruling Principle, influencing and operating on the Mind of Man, di&s;tinct from every natural Power or Mo|tive, I profe&s;s my &s;elf altogether unable to under|&s;tand it, or frame any di&s;tinct Idea of it; and there|fore I cannot a&s;&s;ent to any Propo&s;ition concerning it, nor con&s;equently have any Faith about it: And it is a &s;elf evident Truth, that God obligeth no Man to Impo&s;&s;ibilities. At the reque&s;t of a Philo|&s;ophical Friend, I did ca&s;t an Eye on the Writings he &s;hew'd me of &s;ome Divines, and talked with o|thers on this Subject, but after all I had read or heard cou'd make nothing of it, having always found whenever I laid a&s;ide the Word <HI>Grace,</HI> and looked into my own Mind, a perfect vacuity or privation of all Ideas. And, as I am apt to think Mens Minds and Faculties are made much alike, I &s;u&s;pect that other Men, if they examined what
<PB N="91" REF="98">
they call Grace with the &s;ame exactne&s;s and indif|ference, wou'd agree with me that there was no|thing in it but an empty Name. This is not the only In&s;tance, where a Word often heard and pro|nounced is believed intelligible, for no other rea|&s;on but becau&s;e it is familiar. Of the &s;ame kind are many other Points reputed nece&s;&s;ary Articles of Faith. That which in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e impo&s;eth upon Mankind I take to be partly this. Men &s;peak of this holy Principle as of &s;omething that acts, moves, and determines, taking their Ideas from corporeal things, from Motion and the Force or <HI>Momentum</HI> of Bodies, which being of an obvi|ous and &s;en&s;ible Nature they &s;ub&s;titute in place of a thing &s;piritual and incomprehen&s;ible, which is a manife&s;t Delu&s;ion. For though the Idea of cor|poreal Force be never &s;o clear and intelligible, it will not therefore follow that the Idea of Grace, a thing perfectly incorporeal, mu&s;t be &s;o too. And though we may rea&s;on di&s;tinctly, perceive, a&s;&s;ent, and form Opinions about the one, it will by no means follow that we can do &s;o of the other. Thus it comes to pa&s;s, that a clear &s;en&s;ible Idea of what is real produceth, or rather is made a pre|tence for, an imaginary &s;piritual Faith that termi|nates in no Object; a thing impo&s;&s;ible! For there can be no A&s;&s;ent where there are no Ideas: And where there is no A&s;&s;ent there can be no Faith: And what cannot be, that no Man is obliged to. This is as clear as any thing in <HI>Euclid.</HI></P>

<P>The &s;ame Method of Rea&s;oning may be ap|plied by any Man of Sen&s;e, to con&s;ute all other the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith. You are not therefore to wonder that a Man who proceeds on &s;uch &s;olid Grounds, &s;uch clear and evi|dent Principles, &s;hou'd be deaf to all you can &s;ay from moral Evidence, or probable Arguments,

which are nothing in the balance again&s;t Demon&s;tra|tion. <HI>EUPH.</HI> The more Light and Force there is in this Di&s;cour&s;e, the more you are to blame for not having produced it &s;ooner. For my part, I &s;hou'd never have &s;aid one Word again&s;t Evidence. But let me &s;ee whether I under&s;tand you rightly. You &s;ay, every Word in an intelligible Di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t &s;tand for an Idea; which Ideas as far as they are clearly and di&s;tinctly apprehended, &s;o far the Di&s;cour&s;e hath meaning, without which it is u&s;ele&s;s, and in&s;ignificant. <HI>ALC.</HI> I do. <HI>EUPH.</HI> For in&s;tance, when I hear the Words <HI>Man, Triangle, Colour,</HI> pronounced; they mu&s;t excite in my Mind di&s;tinct Ideas of tho&s;e things whereof they are Signs, otherwi&s;e I cannot be &s;aid to under&s;tand them. <HI>ALC.</HI> Right. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And this is the only true u&s;e of Language. <HI>ALC.</HI> That is what I affirm. <HI>EUPH.</HI> But every time the Word <HI>Man</HI> occurs in Reading or Conver&s;ation, I am not con&s;cious that the particular di&s;tinct Idea of a Man is excited in my mind. For in&s;tance, when I read in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians</HI> the&s;e Words: <HI>If a Man thinketh him&s;elf to be &s;omething, when he is nothing, he deceiveth him&s;elf.</HI> Methinks I com|prehend the Force and Meaning of this Propo&s;ition, although I do not frame to my &s;elf the particular di&s;tin&s;t Idea of a Man. <HI>ALC.</HI> It is very true, you do not form in your Mind the particular Idea of <HI>Peter, James,</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> of a fair or a black, a tall or a low, a fat or a lean, a &s;traight or a crooked, a wi&s;e or a fooli&s;h, a &s;leeping or waking Man, but the ab&s;tract general Idea of <HI>Man,</HI> pre&s;cinding from, and exclu&s;ive of all particular Shape, Size, Com|plexion, Pa&s;&s;ions, Faculties, and every individual Circum&s;tance. To explain this Matter more fully, you are to under&s;tand there is in the Humane Mind, a Faculty of contemplating the general Na|ture of things, &s;eparate from all tho&s;e Particulari|ties
<PB N="93" REF="100">
which di&s;tingui&s;h the Individuals one from a|nother. For Example, in <HI>Peter, James,</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> you may ob&s;erve in each a certain Collection of Stature, Figure, Colour, and other peculiar Properties by which they are known a&s;under, di&s;|tingui&s;hed from all other Men, and, if I may &s;o &s;ay, individuated. Now leaving out of the Idea of a Man, that which is peculiar to the Individual, and retaining only that which is common to all Men, you form an ab&s;tract univer&s;al Idea of <HI>Man</HI> or <HI>Humane Nature,</HI> which includes no particular Stature, Shape, Colour, or other quality whether of Mind or Body. After the &s;ame manner you may ob&s;erve particular Triangles to differ one from another, as their &s;ides are equal or unequal, and their Angles greater or le&s;&s;er; whence they are denominated aequilateral, aequicrural, or &s;calenum, obtu&s;angular, acutangular, or rectangular. But the Mind excluding out of its Idea, all the&s;e pe|culiar Properties and Di&s;tinctions frameth the ge|neral ab&s;tract Idea of a Triangle; which is nei|ther aequilateral, aequicrural, nor &s;calenum, nei|ther obtu&s;angular, acutangular, nor rectangular, but all and none of the&s;e at once <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Locke</HI> on Humane Under&s;tanding, b. 4. c. 7.</NOTE>. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the general ab&s;tract Idea of Colour, which is &s;omething di&s;tinct from and exclu&s;ive of Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, and every other par|ticular Colour, including only that general E&s;&s;ence in which they all agree. And what has been &s;aid of the&s;e three general Names, and the ab&s;tract ge|neral Ideas they &s;tand for may be applied to all o|thers. For you mu&s;t know, that particular Things or Ideas being infinite, if each were marked or &s;ignified by a di&s;tinct proper Name, Words mu&s;t have been innumerable, and Language an endle&s;s impo&s;&s;ible thing. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that
<PB N="94" REF="101">
appellative or general Names &s;tand, immediately and properly, not for particular but for ab&s;tract general Ideas, which they never fail to excite in the mind, as oft as they are u&s;ed to any &s;ignificant Purpo&s;e. And without this, there cou'd be no Communication or Enlargement of Knowledge, no &s;uch thing as univer&s;al Science or Theorems of any kind. Now for under&s;tanding any Propo&s;ition or Di&s;cour&s;e, it is &s;ufficient that di&s;tinct Ideas are thereby rai&s;ed in your mind, corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e in the Speaker's, whether the Ideas &s;o rai&s;ed are particular or only ab&s;tract and general Ideas. Fora&s;much, neverthele&s;s, as the&s;e are not &s;o obvi|ous and familiar to vulgar minds, it happens that &s;ome Men may think they have no Idea at all, when they have not a particular Idea; but the truth is, you had the ab&s;tract general Idea of Man, in the in&s;tance a&s;&s;igned, wherein you thought you had none. After the &s;ame manner, when it is &s;aid, that the three Angles of a Triangle are equal to two right ones; or that Colour is the Object of Sight, it is evident the Words do not &s;tand for this or that Triangle or Colour, but for ab&s;tract general Ideas, excluding every thing peculiar to the Individuals, and including only the univer&s;al Nature common to the whole kind of Triangles or of Colours.</P>

Say now <HI>Alciphron,</HI> is it nece&s;&s;ary every time the&s;e Counters are u&s;ed throughout the whole Progre&s;s of a Game, to frame an Idea of the di&s;tinct Sum or Value that each repre&s;ents? <HI>ALC.</HI> by no means: It is &s;uffi|cient the Players at fir&s;t agree on their re&s;pective Values, and at la&s;t &s;ub&s;titute tho&s;e Values in their &s;tead. <HI>EUPH.</HI> And in ca&s;ting up a Sum, where the Figures &s;tand for Pounds, Shillings, and Pence, do you think it nece&s;&s;ary, throughout the whole Pro|gre&s;s of the Operation, in each Step to form Ideas of Pounds, Shillings, and Pence? <HI>ALC.</HI> I do not, it will &s;uffice if in the Conclu&s;ion tho&s;e Figures direct our Actions with re&s;pect to Things. <HI>EUPH.</HI> From hence it &s;eems to follow that Words may not be in|&s;ignificant, although they &s;hou'd not, every time they are u&s;ed, excite the Ideas they &s;ignify in our Minds, it being &s;ufficient, that we have it in our power to &s;ub&s;titute Things or Ideas for their Signs when there is occa&s;ion. It &s;eems al&s;o to follow, that
<PB N="98" REF="105">
there may be another u&s;e of Words, be&s;ides that of marking and &s;ugge&s;ting di&s;tinct Ideas, to wit, the influencing our Conduct and Actions; which may be done either by forming Rules for us to act by, or by rai&s;ing certain Pa&s;&s;ions, Di&s;po&s;itions, and Emotions in our Minds.

The contrary whereof hav|ing been pre&s;umed &s;eems to have produced the Doctrine of ab&s;tract Ideas. <HI>ALC.</HI> Will you not allow then that the Mind can ab&s;tract? <HI>EUPH.</HI> I do not deny it may ab&s;tract in a certain &s;en&s;e, ina&s;much as tho&s;e things that can really exi&s;t, or be really perceived a&s;under, may be conceived a|&s;under, or ab&s;tracted one from the other; for in|&s;tance a Man's Head from his Body, Colour from Motion, Figure from Weight. But it will not
<PB N="99" REF="106">
thence follow, that the Mind can frame ab&s;tract general Ideas, which appear to be impo&s;&s;ible. <HI>ALC.</HI> And yet it is a current Opinion, that every &s;ub&s;tantive Name marks out and exhibits to the Mind one di&s;tinct Idea &s;eparate from all others. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Pray, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> is not the Word <HI>Num|ber</HI> &s;uch a &s;ub&s;tantive Name? <HI>ALC.</HI> It is. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Do but try now whether you can frame an Idea of Number in ab&s;tract exclu&s;ive of all Signs, Words and Things number'd.

And if, by con&s;idering this Doctrine of Force, Men arrive at the Knowledge of many Inventions in Mechanics, and are taught to frame Engines, by means of which things difficult and o|therwi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible may be performed, and if the &s;ame Doctrine which is &s;o beneficial here below, &s;erveth al&s;o as a Key to di&s;cover the Nature of the Cele&s;tial Motions, &s;hall we deny that it is of u&s;e, either in Practice or Speculation, becau&s;e we have no di&s;tinct Idea of Force?

Whence it &s;eems to follow, that a Man may be|lieve the Doctrine of the Trinity, if he finds it re|vealed in Holy Scripture, That the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t are God, and that there is but one God? Although he doth not frame in his Mind, any ab&s;tract or di&s;tinct Ideas of Trinity, Sub&s;tance, or Per&s;onality, provided, that this

us then &s;uppo&s;e that a Per&s;on hath Ideas, and is con&s;cious during a certain &s;pace of Time, which we will divide into three equal Parts, whereof the later Terms are marked by the Letters A, B, C. In the fir&s;t Part of Time, the Per&s;on gets a certain Number of Ideas, which are retained in A: Dur|ing the &s;econd Part of Time, he retains one half of his old Ideas, and lo&s;eth the other half, in place of which he acquires as many new ones: So that in B his Ideas are half old and half new. And in the third Part, we &s;uppo&s;e him to lo&s;e the Re|mainder of the Ideas acquired in the Fir&s;t, and to get new ones in their &s;tead, which are retained in C, together with tho&s;e acquired in the &s;econd Part of Time. Is this a po&s;&s;ible fair Suppo&s;ition? <HI>ALC.</HI> It is. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Upon the&s;e Premi&s;es I am tempt|ed to think, one may demon&s;trate, that Per&s;onal Identity doth not con&s;i&s;t in Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>ALC.</HI> As how? <HI>EUPH.</HI> You &s;hall judge; but thus it &s;eems to me. The Per&s;ons in A and B are the &s;ame, being con&s;cious of common Ideas by &s;uppo&s;i|tion. The Per&s;on in B is (for the &s;ame Rea&s;on) one and the &s;ame with the Per&s;on in C.

Who doth not &s;ee that &s;uch an ideal ab&s;tracted Faith is never thought of by the Bulk of Chri&s;ti|ans, Husbandmen, for In&s;tance, Arti&s;ans or Ser|vants? Or what Foot&s;teps are there in the Holy Scripture to make us think, that the wiredrawing of ab&s;tract Ideas was a Task injoined either Jews or Chri&s;tians?

<P>It &s;eems, that what hath been now &s;aid may be applied to other My&s;teries of our Religion. Original Sin, for In&s;tance, a Man may find it im|po&s;&s;ible to form an Idea of in ab&s;tract, or of the man|ner of its Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and yet the Belief thereof may produce in his Mind a &s;alutary Sen&s;e of his own Unworthine&s;s, and the Goodne&s;s of his Re|deemer: from whence may follow good Habits, and from them good Actions, the genuine Effects of Faith, which con&s;idered in its true Light, is a thing neither repugnant nor incomprehen&s;ible, as &s;ome Men wou'd per&s;uade us, but &s;uited even to vulgar Capacities, placed in the Will and Affecti|ons rather than in the Under&s;tanding, and produ|cing holy Lives, rather than &s;ubtile Theories. Faith, I &s;ay, is not an indolent Perception but an operative Per&s;ua&s;ion of Mind, which ever worketh &s;ome &s;uitable Action, Di&s;po&s;ition or Emotion in tho&s;e who have it; as it were ea&s;y to prove and illu&s;trate by innumerable In&s;tances, taken from Humane Affairs. And, indeed, while the Chri&s;ti|an Religion is con&s;idered as an In&s;titution fitted to ordinary Minds, rather than to the nicer Talents, whether improved or puzzled, of &s;peculative Men; and our Notions about Faith are accordingly taken from the Commerce of the World, and Practice of Mankind, rather than from the peculiar Sy&s;tems of Refiners; it will, I think, be no difficult Mat|ter to conceive and ju&s;tify the Meaning and U&s;e of our Belief of My&s;teries, again&s;t the mo&s;t confident A&s;&s;ertions and Objections of the Minute Philo&s;o|phers, who are ea&s;ily to be caught in tho&s;e very Snares, which they have &s;pun and &s;pread for others. And that Humour of Controver&s;y, the Mother and Nur&s;e of Here&s;ies, wou'd doubtle&s;s very much abate, if it was con&s;idered that things are to be ra|ted, not by the Colour, Shape, or Stamp, &s;o tru|ly
<PB N="110" REF="117">
as by the Weight. If the Moment of Opinions had been by &s;ome litigious Divines made the Mea|&s;ure of their Zeal, it might have &s;pared much Trouble both to them&s;elves and others. Certain|ly one that takes his Notions of Faith, Opinion, and A&s;&s;ent from Common Sen&s;e, and Common U&s;e, and has maturely weighed the Nature of Signs and Language, will not be &s;o apt to contro|vert the Wording of a My&s;tery, or to break the Peace of the Church, for the &s;ake of retaining or rejecting a Term.</P>

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> It &s;eems, <HI>Euphranor,</HI> and you wou'd per&s;uade me into an Opinion, that there is nothing &s;o &s;ingularly ab&s;urd as we are apt to think, in the Belief of My&s;teries; and that a Man need not re|nounce his Rea&s;on to maintain his Religion. But if this were true, how comes it to pa&s;s, that, in proportion as Men abound in Knowledge, they dwindle in Faith? <HI>EUPH.</HI> O <HI>Alciphron,</HI> I have learned from you, that there is nothing like going to the Bottom of things, and analy&s;ing them into their fir&s;t Principles. I &s;hall therefore make an E&s;&s;ay of this Method, for clearing up the Nature of Faith: with what Succe&s;s, I &s;hall leave you to determine; for I dare not pronounce my &s;elf on my own Judgment, whether it be right or wrong: But thus it &s;eems to me. The Objections made to Faith are by no means an Effect of Knowledge, but proceed rather from an Ignorance of what Knowledge is; which Ignorance may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ound even in tho&s;e who pa&s;s for Ma&s;ters of this or that particular Branch of Knowledge. Science and Faith agree in this, that they both imply an A&s;&s;ent of the Mind: And, as the Nature of the Fir&s;t is mo&s;t clear and evident, it &s;hou'd be fir&s;t con&s;idered in order to ca&s;t a Light on the other. To trace things from their Original, it &s;eems that
<PB N="111" REF="118">
the Humane Mind, naturally furni&s;hed with the Ideas of things particular and concrete, and being de&s;ign'd, not for the bare Intuition of Ideas, but for Action or Operation about them, and pur&s;uing her own Happine&s;s therein, &s;tands in need of cer|tain general Rules or Theorems to direct her Ope|rations in this pur&s;uit; the &s;upplying which Want is the true, original, rea&s;onable End of &s;tudying the Arts and Sciences. Now the&s;e Rules being general, it follows, that they are not to be ob|tained by the meer Con&s;ideration of the original Ideas, or particular Things, but by the means of Marks or Signs, which, being &s;o far forth univer|&s;al, become the immediate In&s;truments and Mate|rials of Science. It is not therefore by meer Con|templation of particular Things, and much le&s;s of their ab&s;tract general Ideas, that the Mind makes her Progre&s;s, but by an appo&s;ite Choice and skil|ful Management of Signs: For In&s;tance, Force and Number, taken in concrete with there Adjuncts, Subjects, and Signs, are what every one knows; and con&s;idered in ab&s;tract, &s;o as making preci&s;e I|deas of them&s;elves, they are what no Body can comprehend. That their ab&s;tract Nature, there|fore, is not the Foundation of Science, is plain: And that barely con&s;idering their Ideas in concrete, is not the Method to advance in the re&s;pective Sciences, is what every one that reflects may &s;ee; nothing being more evident, than that one who can neither write nor read, in common U&s;e under|&s;tands the meaning of Numeral Words, as well as the be&s;t Philo&s;opher or Mathematician.</P>

<P>But here lies the Difference: the one, who under&s;tands the Notation of Numbers, by means thereof is able to expre&s;s briefly and di&s;tinctly all the Variety and Degrees of Number, and to per|form with ea&s;e and di&s;patch &s;everal arithmetical O|perations,
<PB N="112" REF="119">
by the help of general Rules. Of all which Operations as the U&s;e in Humane Life is very evident, &s;o it is no le&s;s evident, that the per|forming them depends on the aptne&s;s of the Nota|tion. If we &s;uppo&s;e rude Mankind without the U&s;e of Language, it may be pre&s;umed, they wou'd be ignorant of Arithmetic: But the U&s;e of Names, by the Repetition whereof in a certain Order they might expre&s;s endle&s;s Degrees of Number, wou'd be the fir&s;t Step towards that Science. The next Step wou'd be, to devi&s;e proper Marks of a per|manent Nature, and vi&s;ible to the Eye, the Kind and Order whereof mu&s;t be cho&s;e with Judgment, and accommodated to the Names. Which Mark|ing, or Notation, wou'd, in Proportion as it was apt and regular, facilitate the Invention and Ap|plication of general Rules, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Mind in rea&s;oning, and judging, in extending, recording, and communicating its Knowledge about Numbers: in which Theory and Operations, the Mind is im|mediately occupied about the Signs or Notes, by Mediation of which it is directed to act about Things, or Number in concrete (as the Logicians call it) without ever con&s;idering the &s;imple, ab|&s;tract, intellectual, general Idea of Number. I imagine one need not think much to be convinced, that the Science of Arithmetic, in its Ri&s;e, Ope|rations, Rules, and Theorems, is altogether con|ver&s;ant about the artificial U&s;e of Signs, Names, and Characters. The&s;e Names and Characters are univer&s;al, ina&s;much as they are Signs. The Names are referred to Things, and the Characters to Names, and both to Operation. The Names be|ing few, and proceeding by a certain Analogy, the Characters will be more u&s;eful, the &s;impler they are, and the more aptly they expre&s;s this Analo|gy. Hence the old Notation by Letters was more u&s;eful than Words written at length: And the
<PB N="113" REF="120">
modern Notation by Figures, expre&s;&s;ing the Pro|gre&s;&s;ion or Analogy of the Names by their &s;imple Places, is much preferable to that for Ea&s;e and Expedition, as the Invention of Algebraical Sym|bols is to this for exten&s;ive and general U&s;e. As Arithmetic and Algebra are Sciences of great Clear|ne&s;s, Certainty, and Extent, which are immedi|ately conver&s;ant about Signs, upon the skilful U&s;e and Management whereof they intirely depend, &s;o a little Attention to them may po&s;&s;ibly help us to judge of the Progre&s;s of the Mind in other Sci|ences, which, though differing in Nature, De&s;ign, and Object, may yet agree in the general Methods of Proof and Inquiry.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<P>If I mi&s;take not, all Sciences, &s;o far as they are univer&s;al and demon&s;trable by Humane Rea&s;on, will be found conver&s;ant about Signs as their immediate Object, though the&s;e in the Ap|plication are referred to Things: the Rea&s;on whereof is not difficult to comprehend. For as the Mind is better acquainted with &s;ome &s;ort of Objects, which are earlier &s;ugge&s;ted to it, &s;trike it more &s;en&s;ibly, or are more ea&s;ily comprehended than others, it is naturally led to &s;ubtitute, tho&s;e Objects for &s;uch as are more &s;ubtile, fleeting, or difficult to conceive. Nothing, I &s;ay, is more na|tural, than to make the Things we know, a Step towards tho&s;e we do not know; and to explain and repre&s;ent Things le&s;s familiar by others which are more &s;o. Now, it is certain we imagine before we reflect, and we perceive by Sen&s;e before we i|magine; and of all our Sen&s;es the Sight is the mo&s;t clear, di&s;tinct, various, agreeable, and comprehen|&s;ive. Hence it is natural to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Intellect by the Imagination, the Imagination by Sen&s;e, and the other Sen&s;es by Sight. Hence, Figures, Me|taphors, and Types. We illu&s;trate &s;piritual

Things by corporeal; we &s;ub&s;titute Sounds for Thoughts, and written Letters for Sounds; Emb|lems, Symbols, and Hieroglyphics for Things too ob&s;cure to &s;trike, and too various or too fleeting to be retained. We &s;ub&s;titute Things imaginable, for Things intelligible, &s;en&s;ible Things for imagi|nable, &s;maller Things for tho&s;e that are too great to comprehend ea&s;ily, and greater Things for &s;uch as are too &s;mall to be di&s;cerned di&s;tinctly, pre&s;ent Things for ab&s;ent, permanent for peri&s;hing, and vi&s;ible for invi&s;ible.

Hence we &s;peak of Spirits in a figurative Style, expre&s;&s;ing the Operations of the Mind by Allu&s;ions and Terms, borrowed from &s;en&s;ible Things, &s;uch as <HI>apprehend, conceive, reflect, di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> and &s;uch like: And hence tho&s;e Allego|ries which illu&s;trate Things intellectual by Vi&s;ions exhibited to the Fancy. <HI>Plato,</HI> for In&s;tance, re|pre&s;ents the Mind pre&s;iding in her Vehicle by the Driver of a winged Chariot, which &s;ometimes moults and droops: this Chariot is drawn by two Hor&s;es, the one good and of a good Race, the o|ther of a contrary kind, &s;ymbolically expre&s;&s;ing the Tendency of the Mind towards the Divinity, as &s;he &s;oars or is born aloft by two In&s;tincts like Wings, the one in the Intellect towards Truth, the other in the Will towards Excellence, which In&s;tincts moult or are weakened by &s;en&s;ual Inclina|tions, expre&s;&s;ing al&s;o her alternate Elevations and Depre&s;&s;ions, the Struggles between Rea&s;on and Ap|petite, like Hor&s;es that go an unequal Pace, or draw different Ways, embarra&s;&s;ing the Soul in her Progre&s;s to Perfection.

<P>Thus much, upon the whole, may be &s;aid of all Signs: That they do not always &s;ugge&s;t Ideas &s;ignified to the Mind, That when they &s;ug|ge&s;t Ideas, they are not general ab&s;tract Ideas: That they have other U&s;es be&s;ides barely &s;tanding for and exhibiting Ideas, &s;uch as rai&s;ing proper E|motions, producing certain Di&s;po&s;itions or Ha|bits of Mind, and directing our Actions in pur&s;uit of that Happine&s;s, which is the ultimate End and De&s;ign, the Primary Spring and Motive, that &s;ets rational Agents at work: That the true End of Speech, Rea&s;on, Science, Faith, A&s;&s;ent in all its different Degrees, is not meerly, or principally, or always the imparting or acquiring of Ideas, but ra|ther &s;omething of an active, operative Nature, tending to a conceived Good, which may &s;ome|times be obtained, not only although the Ideas marked are not offered to the Mind, but even al|though there &s;hou'd be no po&s;&s;ibility of offering or exhibiting any &s;uch Idea to the Mind: For In|&s;tance, the Algebraic Mark, which denotes the Root of a negative Square, hath its U&s;e in Logi&s;tic Operations, although it be impo&s;&s;ible to form an Idea of any &s;uch Quantity. And what is true of Algebraic Signs, is al&s;o true of Words or Lan|guage, modern Algebra being in fact a more &s;hort, appo&s;ite, and artificial Sort of Language, and it being po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s by Words at length, though le&s;s conveniently, all the Steps of an Al|gebraical Proce&s;s. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that even the Mathematical Sciences them&s;elves, which above all others are reckoned the mo&s;t clear and certain, if they are con&s;idered, not as In&s;truments to direct our Practice, but as Speculations to em|ploy our Curio&s;ity, will be found to fall &s;hort in

many In&s;tances of tho&s;e clear and di&s;tinct Ideas, which, it &s;eems, the Minute Philo&s;ophers of this Age, whether knowingly or ignorantly, expect and in&s;i&s;t upon in the My&s;teries of Religion.</P>

<P>Be the Science or Subject what it will, when&s;oever Men quit Particulars for Generalities, things Concrete for Ab&s;tractions, when they for|&s;ake practical Views, and the u&s;eful Purpo&s;es of Knowledge for barren Speculation, con&s;idering Means and In&s;truments as ultimate Ends, and la|bouring to attain preci&s;e Ideas which they &s;uppo&s;e indi&s;criminately annexed to all Terms, they will be &s;ure to embarra&s;s them&s;elves with Difficulties and Di&s;putes. Such are tho&s;e which have &s;prung up in Geometry about the Nature of the Angle of Contact, the Doctrine of Proportions, of Indivi&s;i|bles Infinite&s;imals, and divers other Points; notwith|&s;tanding all which, that Science is very rightly e&s;|teemed an excellent and u&s;eful one, and is really &s;ound to be &s;o in many Occa&s;ions of Humane Life, wherein it governs and directs the Actions of Men, &s;o that by the Aid or Influence thereof tho&s;e Ope|rations become ju&s;t and accurate, which wou'd o|therwi&s;e be faulty and uncertain. And from a pa|rity of Rea&s;on, we &s;hou'd not conclude any other Doctrines which govern, influence or direct the Mind of Man to be, any more than that, the le&s;s true or excellent, becau&s;e they afford matter of Controver&s;y and u&s;ele&s;s Speculation to curious and licentious Wits: Particularly tho&s;e Articles of our Chri&s;tian Faith, which, in proportion as they are believed, per&s;uade, and, as they per&s;uade, influ|ence the Lives and Actions of Men. As to the perplexity of Contradictions and ab&s;tracted Noti|ons, in all parts whether of Humane Science or Divine Faith, Cavillers may equally object, and un|wary Per&s;ons incur, while the judicious avoid it.

There is no need to depart from the received Rules of Rea&s;oning to ju&s;tify the Belief of Chri&s;tians.

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> I will allow, <HI>Euphranor,</HI> this Rea&s;oning of yours to have all the Force you meant it &s;hou'd have. I freely own there may be My&s;teries: That we may believe, where we do not under&s;tand: And that Faith may be of u&s;e al|though its Object is not di&s;tinctly apprehended. In a word, I grant their may be Faith and My&s;te|ries in other Things but not in Religion: And that for this plain Rea&s;on: Becau&s;e it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, there &s;hou'd be any &s;uch thing as Religi|on; and if there be no Religion it follows there cannot be Religious Faith or My&s;teries. Religion, it is evident, implies the Wor&s;hip of a God; which Wor&s;hip &s;uppo&s;eth Rewards and Puni&s;hments, which &s;uppo&s;e Merits and Demerits, Actions good
<PB N="118" REF="125">
and evil, and the&s;e &s;uppo&s;e Humane Liberty, a thing impo&s;&s;ible; and con&s;equently Religion a thing built thereon mu&s;t be an unrea&s;onable ab&s;urd thing. There can be no rational Hopes or Fears where there is no Guilt, nor any Guilt where there is no|thing done, but what unavoidably follows from the Structure of the World and the Laws of Motion. Corporeal Objects &s;trike on the Organs of Sen&s;e, whence en&s;ues a Vibration in the Nerves, which, being communicated to the Soul or Animal Spirit in the Brain or Root of the Nerves, produceth therein that Motion called Volition: And this pro|duceth a new Determination in the Spirits, cau&s;ing them to flow into &s;uch Nerves as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily by the Laws of Mechani&s;m produce &s;uch certain Actions. This being the Ca&s;e, it follows that tho&s;e things which vulgarly pa&s;s for Humane Ac|tions are to be e&s;teemed Mechanical, and that they are fal&s;ely a&s;cribed to a free Principle. There is therefore no Foundation for Prai&s;e or Blame, Fear or Hope, Reward or Puni&s;hment, nor con&s;equently for Religion, which, as I ob&s;erved before, is built upon and &s;uppo&s;eth tho&s;e things. <HI>EUPH.</HI> You imagine, <HI>Alciphron,</HI> if I rightly under&s;tand you, that Man is a &s;ort of Organ played on by outward Objects, which according to the different &s;hape and texture of the Nerves produce different Motions and Effects therein. <HI>ALC.</HI> Man may, indeed, be fitly compared to an Organ; but a Puppet is the very Thing. You mu&s;t know, that certain Parti|cles i&s;&s;uing forth in right Lines from all &s;en&s;ible Objects compo&s;e &s;o many Rays, or Filaments, which drive, draw, and actuate every part of the Soul and Body of Man, ju&s;t as Threads or Wires do the joints of that little wooden Machine vulgar|ly called a <HI>Puppet:</HI> With this only difference that the latter are gro&s;s and vi&s;ible to common eyes, whereas the former are too fine and &s;ubtile to be
<PB N="119" REF="126">
di&s;cerned by any but a &s;agacious Free-thinker. This admirably accounts for all tho&s;e Operations, which we have been taught to a&s;cribe to a think|ing Principle within us. <HI>EUPH.</HI> This is an inge|nious Thought, and mu&s;t be of great u&s;e in freeing Men from all Anxiety about Moral Notions, as it transfers the Principle of Action from the Humane Soul to things outward and foreign. But I have my Scruples about it. For you &s;uppo&s;e the Mind in a literal &s;en&s;e to be moved and its Volitions to be meer Motions. Now if another &s;hou'd affirm, as it is not impo&s;&s;ible &s;ome or other may, that the Soul is incorporeal, and that Motion is one thing and Volition another, I wou'd fain know how you cou'd make your Point clear to &s;uch a one. It mu&s;t be owned very clear to tho&s;e who admit the Soul to be corporeal, and all her Acts to be but &s;o many Motions. Upon this Suppo&s;ition, indeed, the Light wherein you place Humane Nature is no le&s;s true, than it is fine and new. But let any one deny this Suppo&s;ition, which is ea&s;ily done, and the whole Super&s;tructure falls to the ground. If we grant the abovementiond Points, I will not deny a fatal Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t en&s;ue. But I &s;ee no rea&s;on for granting them. On the contrary it &s;eems plain, that Motion and Thought are two Things as really and as manife&s;tly di&s;tinct as a Triangle and a Sound. It &s;eems therefore, that in order to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of Humane Actions, you &s;up|po&s;e what wants Proof as much as the very Point to be proved.</P>

con&s;iders it: In the next Place the Judgment decrees about it, as a thing to be cho&s;en or rejected, to be omitted or done, in this or that manner: And this Decree of the Judgment doth nece&s;&s;arily determine the Will, who&s;e Office is meerly to execute what is ordained by another Fa|culty: Con&s;equently there is no &s;uch thing as Free|dom of the Will: For that which is nece&s;&s;ary cannot be free. In Freedom there &s;hou'd be an Indiffe|rence to either &s;ide of the Que&s;tion, a Power to act or not to act, without per&s;cription or con|troul: And without this Indifference and this Pow|er, it is evident the Will cannot be free. But it is no le&s;s evident, that the Will is not indifferent in its Actions, being ab&s;olutely determined and governed by the Judgment. Now whatever moves the Judgment, whether the greate&s;t pre&s;ent Un|ea&s;ine&s;s, or the greate&s;t apparent Good, or what|ever el&s;e it be, it is all one to the Point in hand. The Will being ever concluded and controlled by the Judgment is in all Ca&s;es alike under Nece&s;&s;ity. There is, indeed, throughout the whole of Hu|mane Nature, nothing like a Principle of Free|dom, every Faculty being determined in all its Acts by &s;omething foreign to it. The Under&s;tand|ing, for In&s;tance, cannot alter its Idea, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ee it &s;uch as it pre&s;ents it &s;elf. The Appetites by a natural Nece&s;&s;ity are carried to|wards their re&s;pective Objects. Rea&s;on cannot infer indifferently any thing from any thing, but is limited by the Nature and Connexion of things, and the eternal Rules of Rea&s;oning. And as this is confe&s;&s;edly the Ca&s;e of all other Faculties, &s;o it equally holds with re&s;pect to the Will it &s;elf, as hath been already &s;hewn.

In the fir&s;t place I ob|&s;erve, you take that for granted which I cannot grant, when you a&s;&s;ert whatever is certain the &s;ame to be nece&s;&s;ary. To me, Certain and Nece&s;&s;ary &s;eem very different; there being nothing in the former notion that implies Con&s;traint, nor con&s;e|quently which may not con&s;i&s;t with a Man's being accountable for his Actions. If it is fore&s;een that &s;uch an Action &s;hall be done: May it not al&s;o be
<PB N="123" REF="130">
fore&s;een that it &s;hall be an Effect of Humane Choice and Liberty? In the next place I ob&s;erve, that you very nicely ab&s;tract and di&s;tingui&s;h the Actions of the Mind, Judgment, and Will: That you make u&s;e of &s;uch Terms as Power, Faculty, Act, Deter|mination, Indifference, Freedom, Nece&s;&s;ity, and the like, as if they &s;tood for di&s;tinct ab&s;tract Ideas: And that this Suppo&s;ition &s;eems to en&s;nare the Mind into the &s;ame Perplexities and Errors, which, in all other In&s;tances, are ob&s;erved to attend the Doctrine of Ab&s;traction. It is &s;elf evident, that there is &s;uch a thing as Motion; and yet there have been found Philo&s;ophers, who, by refined Rea&s;oning, wou'd undertake to prove there was no &s;uch thing. Walking before them was thought the proper Way to confute tho&s;e ingenious Men. It is no le&s;s evident, that Man is a free Agent: and though by ab&s;tracted Rea&s;onings you &s;hou'd puzzle me, and &s;eem to prove the contrary, yet &s;o long as I am con&s;cious of my own Actions, this in|ward Evidence of plain Fact will bear me up a|gain&s;t all your Rea&s;onings, however &s;ubtile and re|fined. The confuting plain Points by ob&s;cure ones, may perhaps convince me of the Ability of your Philo&s;ophers, but never of their Tenets. I cannot conceive why the acute <HI>Cratylus</HI> &s;hou'd &s;uppo&s;e a Power of Acting in the Appetite and Rea&s;on, and none at all in the Will? Allowing, I &s;ay, the Di&s;tinction of three &s;uch Beings in the Mind, I do not &s;ee how this cou'd be true. But if I cannot ab|&s;tract and di&s;tingui&s;h &s;o many Beings in the Soul of Man &s;o accurately as you do, I do not find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, &s;ince it is evident to me in the gro&s;s and concrete that I am a free Agent. Nor will it avail to &s;ay, the Will is governed by the Judgment, or determined by the Object, while, in every &s;udden common Ca&s;e, I cannot di&s;cern nor ab&s;tract the Decree of the Judgment from the Command of the
<PB N="124" REF="131">
Will; while I know the &s;en&s;ible Object to be ab|&s;olutely inert: And la&s;tly, while I am con&s;cious that I am an active Being, who can and do deter|mine my &s;elf. If I &s;hou'd &s;uppo&s;e things &s;piritual to be corporeal, or refine things actual and real in|to general ab&s;tracted Notions, or by metaphy&s;ical Skill &s;plit things &s;imple and individual into mani|fold Parts, I do not know what may follow: But if I take things as they are, and ask any plain un|tutored Man, whether he acts or is free in this or that particular Action, he readily a&s;&s;ents, and I as readily believe him from what I find within. And thus, by an Induction of Particulars, I may conclude Man to be a free Agent, although I may be puzzled to define or conceive a Notion of Free|dom in general and ab&s;tract. And if Man be free he is plainly accountable. But if you &s;hall define, ab&s;tract, &s;uppo&s;e, and it &s;hall follow that accord|ing to your Definitions, Ab&s;tractions, and Suppo|&s;itions, there can be no Freedom in Man, and you &s;hall thence infer that he is not accountable, I &s;hall make bold to depart from your metaphy&s;ical ab|&s;tracted Sen&s;e, and appeal to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind.</P>

<P>If we con&s;ider the Notions that obtain in the World of Guilt and Merit, Prai&s;e and Blame, Accountable and Unaccountable, we &s;hall find the common Que&s;tion in order to applaud or cen&s;ure, acquit or condemn a Man, is, whether he did &s;uch an Action? and whether he was him&s;elf when he did it? which comes to the &s;ame thing. It &s;hou'd &s;eem therefore that in the ordinary Commerce of Mankind, any Per&s;on is e&s;teemed accountable &s;imp|ly as he is an Agent. And though you &s;hou'd tell me that Man is inactive, and that the &s;en&s;ible Ob|jects act upon him, yet my own Experience a&s;&s;ures me of the contrary. I know I act, and what I
<PB N="125" REF="132">
act I am accountable for. And if this be true, the Foundation of Religion and Morality remains un|&s;haken. Religion, I &s;ay is concerned no farther than that Man &s;hou'd be Accountable: And this he is ac|cording to my Sen&s;e, and the common Sen&s;e of the World, if he acts; and that he doth act is &s;elf evident. The Grounds, therefore, and Ends of Religion are &s;ecured; whether your philo&s;ophic Notion of Liberty agrees with Man's Actions or no, and whether his Actions are certain or contin|gent, the Que&s;tion being not whether he did it with a Free Will, or what determined his Will? not, whether it was certain or foreknown that he wou'd do it? but only whether he did it wilfully? as what mu&s;t entitle him to the Guilt or Merit of it. <HI>ALC.</HI> But &s;till, the Que&s;tion recurs, whether Man bee Free? <HI>EUPH.</HI> To determine this Que&s;|tion, ought we not fir&s;t to determine what is meant by the word <HI>Free? ALC.</HI> We ought. <HI>EUPH.</HI> In my Opinion, a Man is &s;aid to be Free, &s;o far forth as he can do what he will. Is this &s;o or is it not? <HI>ALC.</HI> It &s;eems &s;o. <HI>EUPH.</HI> Man there|fore acting according to his Will, is to be account|ed Free. <HI>ALC.</HI> This I admit to be true in the Vulgar Sen&s;e. But a Philo&s;opher goes higher, and inquires whether Man be free to will? <HI>EUPH.</HI> That is, whether he can will as he wills? I know not how Philo&s;ophical it may be to ask this Que&s;ti|on, but it &s;eems very unintelligible. The Noti|ons of Guilt and Merit, Ju&s;tice and Reward are in the Minds of Men, antecedent to all Metaphy|&s;ical Di&s;qui&s;itions: And according to tho&s;e receiv|ed natural Notions, it is not doubted that Man is accountable, that he acts, and is &s;elf-determin|ed.</P>

But if we begin with Generalities, and lay our Foundation in ab&s;tract Ideas, we &s;hall find our &s;elves entangled and lo&s;t in a Labyrinth of our own making. I need not ob|&s;erve, what every one mu&s;t &s;ee, the ridicule of proving Man no Agent, and yet pleading for free Thought and Action, of &s;etting up at once for Ad|vocates of Liberty and Nece&s;&s;ity. I have ha&s;tily thrown together the&s;e Hints or Remarks, on what you call a fundamental Article of the Minute Phi|lo&s;ophy, and your Method of proving it, which &s;eems to furni&s;h an admirable Specimen of the So|phi&s;try of ab&s;tract Ideas. If in this &s;ummary way I have been more dogmatical than became me, you mu&s;t excu&s;e what you occa&s;ioned, by declining a joint and lei&s;urely Examination of the Truth. <HI>ALC.</HI> I think we have examined Matters &s;uffici|ently. <HI>CRI.</HI> To all you have &s;aid again&s;t Humane

Liberty, it is a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to ob&s;erve that your Arguments proceed upon an erroneous Sup|po&s;ition, either of the Soul's being corporeal, or of ab&s;tract Ideas. And on the other hand, there is not need of much Inquiry to be convinced of two Points, than which none are more evident, more obvious, and more univer&s;ally admitted by Men of all &s;orts, learned or unlearned, in all Times and Places, to wit, that Man acts and is accountable for his Actions. Whatever Ab&s;tracters, Refiners, or Men prejudiced to a fal&s;e Hypothe&s;is may pre|tend, it is, if I mi&s;take not, evident to every think|ing Man of common Sen&s;e, that Humane Minds are &s;o far from being Engines or Foot-balls, acted upon and bandied about by corporeal Objects, without any inward Principle of Freedom or Acti|on, that the only original true Notions that we have of Freedom, Agent, or Action, are obtained by reflecting on our &s;elves, and the Operations of our own Minds. The Singularity and Credulity of Minute Philo&s;ophers, who &s;uffer them&s;elves to be abu&s;ed by the Paralogi&s;ms of three or four eminent Patriarchs of Infidelity in the la&s;t Age, is, I think, not to be matched; there being no In&s;tance of bigotted Super&s;tition, the Ringleaders whereof have been able to &s;educe their Followers more openly and more widely from the plain Dictates of Nature and common Sen&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>ALC.</HI> It has been always an Objection again&s;t the Di&s;coverers of Truth, that they depart from received Opinions. The Character of Singu|larity is a Tax on Free-thinking: And as &s;uch we mo&s;t willingly bear it, and glory in it. A Genuine Philo&s;opher is never mode&s;t in a fal&s;e Sen&s;e, to the preferring Authority before Rea&s;on, or an old and common Opinion before a true one. Which fal&s;e Mode&s;ty, as it di&s;courages Men from treading in

untrodden Paths, or &s;triking out new Light, is a|bove all other Qualities the greate&s;t Enemy to Free-thinking. <HI>CRI.</HI> Authority in di&s;putable Points will have its Weight with a judicious Mind, which yet will follow Evidence wherever it leads. Without preferring we may allow it a good Second to Rea&s;on. Your Gentlemen, therefore, of the Minute Philo&s;ophy, may &s;pare a World of Com|mon Place upon Rea&s;on, and Light, and Di&s;cove|ries.

Your Schemes and Principles, and boa&s;ted Demon&s;trati|ons have been at large propo&s;ed and examined. You have &s;hifted your Notions, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively retreat|ed from one Scheme to another, and in the End renounced them all. Your Objections have been treated in the &s;ame Manner, and with the &s;ame Event. If we except all that relates to the parti|cular Errors and Faults of private Per&s;ons, and Difficulties which, from the Nature of Things, we are not obliged to explain, it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee, after &s;uch magnificent Threats, how little remains, that can amount to a pertinent Objection again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Religion. What you have produced has been tried by the fair Te&s;t of Rea&s;on; and though you &s;hou'd hope to prevail by Ridicule when you cannot by Rea&s;on, yet in the up&s;hot, I apprehend you will find it impracticable to de&s;troy all Sen&s;e of Religion. Make your Countrymen ever &s;o vicious, ignorant, and profane, Men will &s;till be di&s;po&s;ed to look up to a &s;upreme Being.

But, Sceptic as you are, you own it, probable there is a God, certain that the Chri&s;tian Religion is u&s;e|ful, po&s;&s;ible it may be true, certain that if it be the Minute Philo&s;ophers are in a bad way. This being the Ca&s;e, how can it be que&s;tioned what cour&s;e a wi&s;e Man &s;hou'd take? Whether the Prin|ciples of Chri&s;tians or Infidels are true&s;t may be made a Que&s;tion, but which are &s;afe&s;t can be none. Certainly if you doubt of all Opinions you mu&s;t doubt of your own; and then, for ought you know, the Chri&s;tian may be true. The more doubt, the more room there is for Faith, a Sceptic of all Men having the lea&s;t Right to demand Evidence. But, whatever uncertainty there may be in other Points, thus much is certain: either there is or is not a God: there is or is not a Revelation: Man either is or is not an Agent: The Soul is or is not Immortal. If the Negatives are not &s;ure, the Af|firmatives are po&s;&s;ible. If the Negatives are im|probable, the Affirmatives are probable. In Pro|portion, as any of your ingenious Men finds him|&s;elf unable to prove any one of the&s;e Negatives, he hath grounds to &s;u&s;pect he may be mi&s;taken. A Minute Philo&s;opher, therefore, that wou'd act a con&s;i&s;tent part, &s;hou'd have the Diffidence, the Mode&s;ty, and the Timidity, as well as the Doubts, of a Sceptic; not pretend to an Ocean of Light, and then lead us to an Aby&s;s of Darkne&s;s.

This, &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> is accounted for by <HI>Ari|&s;totle,</HI> who tells us that Arguments have not an Effect on all Men, but only on them who&s;e Minds are prepared by Education and Cu&s;tom, as Land is for Seed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ethic. ad Nicom. l. 10. c. 9.</NOTE>. Make a Point never &s;o clear, it is great odds, that a Man, who&s;e Habits and the Bent of who&s;e Mind lie a contrary way, &s;hall be unable to comprehend it. So weak a thing is Rea&s;on in Competition with Inclination. I replied, this an|&s;wer might hold with re&s;pect to other Per&s;ons and other Times: but when the que&s;tion was of inqui|&s;itive Men, in an Age wherein Rea&s;on was &s;o much cultivated, and Thinking &s;o much in vogue, it did not &s;eem &s;atisfactory. I have known it remarked, &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> by a Man of much Ob&s;ervation, that in the pre&s;ent Age Thinking is more talk'd of but le&s;s practi&s;ed than in ancient times; and that &s;ince the Revival of Learning Men have read much and wrote much but thought little: in&s;omuch that with us to think clo&s;ely and ju&s;tly is the lea&s;t part of a learned Man, and none at all of a polite Man. The Free-thinkers, it mu&s;t be owned, make great Preten&s;ions to Thinking, and yet they &s;hew but little Exactne&s;s in it. A lively Man, &s;aid he, and what the World calls a Man of &s;en&s;e are often de&s;|titute
<PB N="135" REF="142">
of this Talent, which is not a meer gift of Nature, but mu&s;t be improved and perfected, by much Attention and Exerci&s;e on very different Sub|jects, a thing of more pains and time than the ha&s;ty Men of parts in our Age care to take. Such were the Sentiments of a judicious Friend of mine: And, if you are not already &s;ufficiently convinced of the&s;e Truths, you need only ca&s;t an eye on the dark and confu&s;ed, but neverthele&s;s admired, Writers of this famous Sect: And then you will be able to judge, whether tho&s;e who are led by Men of &s;uch wrong Heads can have very good ones of their own. Such, for in&s;tance, was <HI>Spino&s;a</HI> the great Leader of our modern Infidels, in whom are to be found ma|ny Schemes and Notions much admired and fol|lowed of late years: &s;uch as undermining Religi|on under the pretence of vindicating and explain|ing it: The maintaining it not nece&s;&s;ary to believe in Chri&s;t according to the Fle&s;h: The per&s;uading Men that Miracles are to be under&s;tood only in a &s;piritual and allegorical &s;en&s;e: That Vice is not &s;o bad a thing as we are apt to think: That Men are meer Machines impelled by fatal Nece&s;&s;ity. I have heard, &s;aid I, <HI>Spino&s;a</HI> repre&s;ented as a Man of clo&s;e Argument and Demon&s;tration. He did, replied <HI>Crito,</HI> demon&s;trate; but it was after &s;uch a manner, as any one may demon&s;trate any thing. Allow a Man the privilege to make his own Definitions of common Words, and it will be no hard matter for him to infer Conclu&s;ions, which in one &s;en&s;e &s;hall be true and in another fal&s;e, at once &s;eeming Para|doxes and manife&s;t Trui&s;ms.

<P>And &s;o great a Noi&s;e do the&s;e Men make, with their thinking, rea&s;oning, and demon|&s;trating, as to prejudice &s;ome well-meaning Per&s;ons again&s;t all U&s;e and improvement of Rea&s;on. Ho|ne&s;t <HI>Demea,</HI> having &s;een a Neighbour of his ruined by the Vices of a Free-thinking Son, contracted &s;uch a Prejudice again&s;t Thinking, that he wou'd not &s;uffer his own to read <HI>Euclid,</HI> being told it might teach him to think; till a Friend convinced him the epidemical Di&s;temper was not Thinking, but only the want and affectation of it. I know an eminent Free-thinker, who never goes to bed, without a Gallon of Wine in his Belly, and is &s;ure to repleni&s;h before the Fumes are off his Brain, by which means he has not had one &s;ober Thought the&s;e &s;even Years; another, that wou'd not for the World lo&s;e the Privilege and Reputation of Free-thinking, who games all Night, and lies in bed all Day: And as for the Out&s;ide or Appearance of Thought in that meagre Minute Philo&s;opher <HI>Ibycus,</HI> it is an Effect, not of thinking, but of carking, cheating, and writing in an Office. Strange, &s;aid he, that &s;uch Men &s;hou'd &s;et up for Free-thinkers! But it is yet more &s;trange that other Men &s;hou'd be out of Conceit with Thinking and Rea&s;oning, for the &s;ake of &s;uch Pretenders. I an&s;wered, that &s;ome good Men conceived an Oppo&s;ition between Rea&s;on and Religion, Faith and Knowledge, Na|ture and Grace; and that, con&s;equently, the way to promote Religion was, to quench the light of Nature, and di&s;courage all rational Inquiry.</P>

<P>How right the Intentions of the&s;e Men may be, replied <HI>Crito,</HI> I &s;hall not &s;ay; but &s;urely their Notions are very wrong. Can any thing be more di&s;honourable to Religion, than the repre|&s;enting it as an unrea&s;onable, unnatural, ignorant In&s;titution? God is the Father of all Lights whe|ther natural or revealed. Natural Concupi&s;cence is one thing, and the Light of Nature another. You cannot therefore argue from the Former again&s;t the Latter: Neither can you from Science fal&s;ly &s;o called, again&s;t real Knowledge. Whatever there|fore is &s;aid of the one in Holy Scripture is not to be interpreted of the other. I in&s;i&s;ted, that Humane Learning in the hands of Divines, had from time to time, created great Di&s;putes and Divi&s;ions in the Church. As ab&s;tracted Metaphy&s;ics, replied <HI>Crito,</HI> have always had a Tendency to produce Di&s;|putes among Chri&s;tians, as well as other Men, &s;o it &s;hou'd &s;eem that genuine Truth and Knowledge wou'd allay this Humour, which makes Men &s;acri|fice the undi&s;puted Duties of Peace and Charity to di&s;putable Notions. After all, &s;aid I, whatever may be &s;aid for Rea&s;on, it is plain, the Sceptics and Infidels of the Age are not to be cured by it. I will not di&s;pute this Point, &s;aid <HI>Crito;</HI> in order to cure a Di&s;temper, you &s;hou'd con&s;ider what pro|duced it. Had Men rea&s;oned them&s;elves into a wrong Opinion, one might hope to rea&s;on them out of it. But this is not the Ca&s;e; the Infidelity of mo&s;t Minute Philo&s;ophers &s;eeming an Effect of very different Motives from Thought and Rea&s;on, little Incidents, Vanity, Di&s;gu&s;t, Humour, Incli|nation, without the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Rea&s;on, are often known to make Infidels. Where the general Tendency of a Doctrine is di&s;agreeable, the Mind is prepared to reli&s;h and improve every thing that with the lea&s;t Pretence &s;eems to make again&s;t it.
<PB N="138" REF="145">
Hence the coar&s;e Manners of a Country Curate, the polite ones of a Chaplain, the Wit of a Minute Philo&s;opher, a Je&s;t, a Song, a Tale can &s;erve in|&s;tead of a Rea&s;on for Infidelity. <HI>Bupalus</HI> preferred a Rake in the Church, and then made u&s;e of him as an Argument again&s;t it. Vice, Indolence, Fac|tion, and Fa&s;hion produce Minute Philo&s;ophers, and meer Petulancy not a few. Who then can ex|pect a thing &s;o irrational and capricious &s;hou'd yield to Rea&s;on?

He will ob&s;erve, which of the&s;e is the mo&s;t &s;ublime and rational in its Doctrines, mo&s;t venerable in its My&s;teries, mo&s;t u&s;eful in its Precepts, mo&s;t decent in its Wor&s;hip? Which createth the noble&s;t Hopes, and mo&s;t worthy Views? He will con&s;ider their Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s; which oweth lea&s;t to Hu|mane Arts or Arms? Which flatters the Sen&s;es and gro&s;s Inclinations of Men? Which adorns and improves the mo&s;t excellent Part of our Nature? Which hath been propagated in the mo&s;t wonder|ful Manner? Which hath &s;urmounted the greate&s;t Difficulties, or &s;hew'd the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted Zeal and Sincerity in its Profe&s;&s;ors? He will inquire,
<PB N="139" REF="146">
which be&s;t accords with Nature and Hi&s;tory? He will con&s;ider, what &s;avours of the World, and what looks like Wi&s;dom from above? He will be careful to &s;eparate Humane Allay from that which is Divine; and upon the whole, form his Judg|ment like a rea&s;onable Free-thinker. But in&s;tead of taking &s;uch a rational Cour&s;e, one of the&s;e ha&s;ty Sceptics &s;hall conclude without demurring, there is no Wi&s;dom in Politics, no Hone&s;ty in Dealings, no Knowledge in Philo&s;ophy, no Truth in Reli|gion: And all by one and the &s;ame &s;ort of Infe|rence, from the numerous Examples of Folly, Knavery, Ignorance, and Error, which are to be met with in the World. But, as tho&s;e who are unknowing in every thing el&s;e, imagine them|&s;elves &s;harp&s;ighted in Religion, this learned So|phi&s;m is oftene&s;t levelled again&s;t Chri&s;tianity.</P>

<P>In my Opinion, he, that wou'd con|vince an Infidel who can be brought to Rea&s;on, ought in the fir&s;t place clearly to convince him of the Being of a God, it &s;eeming to me, that any Man who is really a Thei&s;t, cannot be an Enemy to the Chri&s;tian Religion: And that the Ignorance or Disbelief of this fundamental Point, is that which at bottom con&s;titutes the Minute Philo&s;opher. I imagine they, who are acquainted with the great Authors in the Minute Philo&s;ophy, need not be told of this. The being of a God is capable of clear Proof, and a proper Object of Humane Rea|&s;on; whereas the My&s;teries of his Nature, and in|deed whatever there is of My&s;tery in Religion, to endeavour to explain, and prove by Rea&s;on, is a vain Attempt. It is &s;ufficient if we can &s;hew there is nothing ab&s;urd or repugnant in our Belief of tho&s;e Points, and, in&s;tead of framing Hypothe&s;es to explain them, we u&s;e our Rea&s;on only for an|&s;wering the Objections brought again&s;t them. But
<PB N="140" REF="147">
on all Occa&s;ions, we ought to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;eri|ous, mode&s;t, ingenuous Man of Sen&s;e, who hath Scruples about Religion, and behaves like a pru|dent Man in doubt, from the Minute Philo&s;ophers, tho&s;e profane and conceited Men, who mu&s;t needs pro&s;elyte others to their own Doubts. When one of this Stamp pre&s;ents him&s;elf, we &s;hou'd con&s;ider what Species he is of: Whether a fir&s;t or a &s;econd-hand Philo&s;opher, a Libertine, Scorner, or Scep|tic? Each Character requiring a peculiar Treat|ment. Some Men are too ignorant to be humble, without which there can be no Docility: But though a Man mu&s;t in &s;ome degree have thought and con&s;idered to be capable of being convinced, yet it is po&s;&s;ible the mo&s;t ignorant may be laugh'd out of his Opinions. I knew a Woman of Sen&s;e re|duce two Minute Philo&s;ophers, who had long been a Nu&s;ance to the Neighbourhood, by taking her Cue from their predominant Affectations. The one &s;et up for being the mo&s;t incredulous Man upon Earth, the other for the mo&s;t unbounded Freedom. She ob&s;erved to the fir&s;t, that he who had Credu|lity &s;ufficient to tru&s;t the mo&s;t valuable Things, his Life and Fortune, to his Apothecary and Law|yer, ridiculou&s;ly affected the Character of Incredu|lous, by refu&s;ing to tru&s;t his Soul, a Thing in his own account but a meer Trifle, to his Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t. The other, being what you call a Beau, &s;he made &s;en&s;ible how ab&s;olute a Slave he was in point of Dre&s;s, to him the mo&s;t important thing in the World, while he was earne&s;tly contending for a Liberty of Thinking, with which he never troub|led his Head; and how much more it concerned and became him to a&s;&s;ert an Independency on Fa&s;hi|on, and obtain Scope for his Genius, where it was be&s;t qualified to exert it &s;elf. The Minute Philo|&s;ophers at fir&s;t hand are very few, and con&s;idered in them&s;elves, of &s;mall con&s;equence: But their
<PB N="141" REF="148">
Followers, who pin their Faith upon them, are numerous, and not le&s;s confident than credulous; there being &s;omething in the Air and Manner of the&s;e &s;econd-hand Philo&s;ophers, very apt to di&s;|concert a Man of Gravity and Argument, and much more difficult to be born than the Weight of their Objections.</P>

<P><HI>Crito</HI> having made an end, <HI>Euphranor</HI> declared it to be his Opinion, that it wou'd much conduce to the public Benefit, if, in&s;tead of di&s;|couraging Free-thinking, there was erected in the mid&s;t of this Free Country a Dianoetic Academy, or Seminary for Free-thinkers, provided with re|tired Chambers, and Galleries, and &s;hady Walks and Groves, where, after &s;even Years &s;pent in Si|lence and Meditation, a Man might commence a genuine Free-thinker, and from that time forward, have Licence to think what he plea&s;ed, and a Badge to di&s;tingui&s;h him from Counterfeits. In good earne&s;t, &s;aid <HI>Crito,</HI> I imagine that Thinking is the great <HI>De&s;ideratum</HI> of the pre&s;ent Age; and that the real Cau&s;e of whatever is ami&s;s, may ju&s;t|ly be reckoned the general Neglect of Education, in tho&s;e who need it mo&s;t, the People of Fa&s;hion. What can be expected where tho&s;e who have the mo&s;t Influence, have the lea&s;t Sen&s;e, and tho&s;e who are &s;ure to be followed, &s;et the wor&s;t Example? Where Youth &s;o uneducated are yet &s;o forward? Where Mode&s;ty is e&s;teemed Pufillanimity, and a De|ference to Years, Knowledge, Religion, Laws, want of Sen&s;e and Spirit? Such untimely Growth of Geni|us wou'd not have been valued or encouraged by the wi&s;e Men of Antiquity; who&s;e Sentiments on this Point are &s;o ill &s;uited to the Genius of our Times, that it is to be feared modern Ears cou'd not bear them. But however ridiculous &s;uch Maxims might &s;eem to our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Youth, who are &s;o capable and &s;o for|ward
<PB N="142" REF="149">
to try Experiments, and mend the Con&s;ti|tution of their Country, I believe it will be admit|ted by Men of Sen&s;e, that if the Governing part of Mankind wou'd in the&s;e Days, for Experiment's &s;ake, con&s;ider them&s;elves in that old <HI>Homerical</HI> Light as Pa&s;tors of the People, who&s;e Duty it was to improve their Flock, they wou'd &s;oon find that this is to be done by an Education very diffe|rent from the Modern, and othergue&s;s Maxims than tho&s;e of the Minute Philo&s;ophy. If our Youth were really inur'd to Thought and Reflexion, and an Acquaintance with the excellent Writers of Antiquity, we &s;hou'd &s;oon &s;ee that licentious Humour, vulgarly called <HI>Free-thinking,</HI> bani&s;hed from the Pre&s;ence of Gentlemen, together with Ig|norance and ill Ta&s;te; which as they are in&s;epara|ble from Vice, &s;o Men follow Vice for the fake of Plea&s;ure, and fly from Virtue through an abhor|rence of Pain. Their Minds therefore betimes &s;hou'd be formed and accu&s;tomed to receive Plea|&s;ure and Pain from proper Objects, or, which is the &s;ame thing, to have their Inclinations and A|ver&s;ions rightly placed. <GAP DESC="foreign">. This according to <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> was the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the right Education <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plato in Protag. &amp; Ari&s;tot. ethic ad Nicom, l. 2. c. 2. &amp; l. 10. c. 9.</NOTE>. And tho&s;e who, in their own Minds, their Health, or their Fortunes, feel the cur&s;ed Effects of a wrong one, wou'd do well to con&s;ider, they cannot better make amends for what was ami&s;s in them&s;elves, than by preventing the &s;ame in their Po&s;terity.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY TOWARDS <HI>A New Theory of Vi&s;ion.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. _MY De&s;ign is to &s;hew the Manner, where|in we perceive by Sight the Di&s;tance, Magnitude, and Situation of Objects. Al&s;o to con&s;ider the Difference there is betwixt the Ideas of Sight and Touch, and whether there be any Idea common to both Sen&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is, I think, agreed by all, that Di&s;tance, of it &s;elf and immediately, cannot be &s;een: For Di&s;tance being a Line directed end-wi&s;e to the Eye, it projects only one Point in the Fund of the Eye, which Point remains invariably the &s;ame, whether the Di&s;tance be longer or &s;horter.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="154" REF="160">
III. I find it al&s;o acknowledged, that the E&s;ti|mate we make of the Di&s;tance of Objects con&s;ide|derably remote, is rather an Act of Judgment grounded on Experience, than of Sen&s;e. For Example, when I perceive a great Number of in|termediate Objects, &s;uch as Hou&s;es, Fields, Ri|vers, and the like, which I have experienced to take up a con&s;iderable Space, I thence form a Judg|ment or Conclu&s;ion, that the Object I &s;ee beyond them is at a great Di&s;tance. Again, when an Ob|ject appears faint and &s;mall, which at a near Di|&s;tance I have experienced to make a vigorous and large Appearance, I in&s;tantly conclude it to be far off: And this, 'tis evident is the re&s;ult of Experi|ence; without which, from the faintne&s;s and lit|tlene&s;s I &s;hould not have inferred any thing con|cerning the Di&s;tance of Objects.</P>
<P N="4">IV. But when an Object is placed at &s;o near a Di&s;tance, as that the Interval between the Eyes bears any &s;en&s;ible Proportion to it, the Opinion of &s;peculative Men is, that the two Optic Axes (the Fancy that we &s;ee only with one Eye at once being exploded) concurring at the Object do there make an Angle, by means of which, according as it is greater or le&s;&s;er, the Object is perceived to be nearer or farther off <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See what</HI> De&s;cartes <HI>and others have written on this Subject.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">V. Betwixt which, and the foregoing manner of e&s;timating Di&s;tance, there is this remarkable Diffe|rence: That, whereas there was no apparent, ne|ce&s;&s;ary Connexion between &s;mall Di&s;tance and a large and &s;trong Appearance, or between great Di&s;tance and little and faint Appearance, there ap|pears a very nece&s;&s;ary Connexion between an ob|tu&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="161">
Angle and near Di&s;tance, and an acute Angle and farther Di&s;tance. It does not in the lea&s;t de|pend upon Experience, but may be evidently known by any one before he had experienced it, that the nearer the Concurrence of the Optic Axes, the greater the Angle, and the remoter their Con|currence is, the le&s;&s;er will be the Angle compre|hended by them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. There is another way mentioned by Optic Writers, whereby they will have us judge of tho&s;e Di&s;tances, in re&s;pect of which the Breadth of the Pupil hath any &s;en&s;ible bigne&s;s: And that is the greater or le&s;&s;er Divergency of the Rays, which i&s;&s;uing from the vi&s;ible Point, do fall on the Pupil: That Point being judged neare&s;t, which is &s;een by mo&s;t diverging Rays; and that remoter, which is &s;een by le&s;s diverging Rays: And &s;o on, the ap|parent Di&s;tance &s;till increa&s;ing, as the Divergency of the Rays decrea&s;es, till at length it becomes in|finite, when the Rays that fall on the Pupil are to Sen&s;e Parallel. And after this manner it is &s;aid we perceive Di&s;tance when we look only with one Eye.</P>
<P N="7">VII. In this Ca&s;e al&s;o, 'tis plain we are not be|holding to Experience: It being a certain, nece&s;&s;a|ry Truth, that the nearer the direct Rays falling on the Eye approach to Paralleli&s;m, the farther off is the Point of their Inter&s;ection, or the vi&s;ible Point from whence they flow.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Now though the Accounts here given of perceiving near Di&s;tance by Sight are receiv'd for true, and accordingly made u&s;e of in determining the apparent places of Objects, they do neverthe|le&s;s
<PB N="156" REF="162">
&s;eem very un&s;atisfactory: And that for the&s;e following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It is evident that when the Mind perceives any Idea, not immediately and of it &s;elf, it mu&s;t be by the means of &s;ome other Idea: Thus, for In&s;tance, the Pa&s;&s;ions which are in the Mind of a|nother, are of them&s;elves to me invi&s;ible. I may neverthele&s;s perceive them by Sight, though not immediately, yet by means of the Colours they produce in the Countenance. We often &s;ee Shame or Fear in the Looks of a Man, by perceiving the Changes of his Countenance to Red or Pale.</P>
<P N="10">X. Moreover it is evident that no Idea, which is not it &s;elf perceived, can be the means of per|ceiving any other Idea. If I do not perceive the Redne&s;s or Palene&s;s of a Man's Face them&s;elves, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould perceive by them the Pa&s;&s;ions which are in his Mind.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Now from SECT. II. it is plain that Di|&s;tance is in its own nature imperceptible, and yet it is perceived by Sight. It remains, therefore, that it be brought into view by means of &s;ome o|ther Idea, that is it &s;elf immediately perceived in the Act of Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="12">XII. But tho&s;e Lines and Angles, by means whereof &s;ome Men pretend to explain the Percep|tion of Di&s;tance, are them&s;elves not at all perceiv|ed, nor are they in truth ever thought of by tho&s;e unskilful in Optics. I appeal to any one's Expe|rience, whether upon Sight of an Object, he com|putes its Di&s;tance by the bigne&s;s of the Angle, made by the meeting of the two Optic Axes? Or whe|ther he ever thinks of the greater or le&s;&s;er Diver|gency
<PB N="157" REF="163">
of the Rays, which arrive from any Point to his Pupil? Every one is him&s;elf the be&s;t judge of what he perceives, and what not. In vain &s;hall any Man tell me, that I perceive certain Lines and Angles which introduce into my Mind the various Ideas of Di&s;tance, &s;o long as I my &s;elf am con&s;ci|ous of no &s;uch thing.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Since therefore tho&s;e Angles and Lines are not them&s;elves perceived by Sight, it follows from SECT. X. that the Mind does not by them judge of the Di&s;tance of Objects.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. The Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion will be, yet, farther evident to any one that con&s;iders tho&s;e Lines and Angles have no real Exi&s;tence in Nature, being only an Hypothe&s;is fram'd by the Mathema|ticians, and by them introduced into Optics, that they might treat of that Science in a Geometrical way.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The la&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall give for rejecting that Doctrine, is, that tho' we &s;hould grant the real Exi&s;tence of tho&s;e Optic Angles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that it was po&s;&s;ible for the Mind to perceive them; yet the&s;e Principles wou'd not be found &s;ufficient to explain the <HI>Phoenomena</HI> of Di&s;tance, as &s;hall be &s;hewn hereafter.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Now, it being already &s;hewn that Di&s;tance is &s;ugge&s;ted to the Mind, by the Mediation of &s;ome other Idea which is it &s;elf perceived in the Act of Seeing, it remains that we inquire what Ideas, or Sen&s;ations there be that attend Vi&s;ion, unto which we may &s;uppo&s;e the Ideas of Di&s;tance are connected, and by which they are introduced into the Mind. And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is certain by Expe|rience,
<PB N="158" REF="164">
that when we look at a near Object with both Eyes, according as it approaches, or recedes from us, we alter the Di&s;po&s;ition of our Eyes, by le&s;&s;ening or widening the Interval between the Pu|pils. This Di&s;po&s;ition or Turn of the Eyes is at|tended with a Sen&s;ation, which &s;eems to me to be that which in this Ca&s;e brings the Idea of greater or le&s;&s;er Di&s;tance into the Mind.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. Not that there is any natural or nece&s;&s;ary Connexion between the Sen&s;ation we perceive by the Turn of the Eyes, and greater or le&s;&s;er Di|&s;tance; but becau&s;e the Mind has by con&s;tant Ex|perience found the different Sen&s;ations corre&s;pond|ing to the different Di&s;po&s;itions of the Eyes, to be attended each with a different Degree of Di|&s;tance in the Object; There has grown an Habi|tual or Cu&s;tomary Connexion between tho&s;e two &s;orts of Ideas, &s;o that the Mind no &s;ooner perceives the Sen&s;ation ari&s;ing from the different Turn it gives the Eyes, in order to bring the Pupils near|er, or farther a&s;under, but it withal perceives the different Idea of Di&s;tance which was wont to be connected with that Sen&s;ation: Ju&s;t as upon hear|ing a certain Sound, the Idea is immediately &s;ug|ge&s;ted to the Under&s;tanding, which Cu&s;tom had united with it.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Nor do I &s;ee, how I can ea&s;ily be mi&s;ta|ken in this Matter. I know evidently that Di|&s;tance is not perceived of it &s;elf. That by con&s;e|quence, it mu&s;t be perceived by means of &s;ome o|ther Idea which is immediately perceived, and varies with the different Degrees of Di&s;tance. I know al&s;o that the Sen&s;ation ari&s;ing from the Turn of the Eyes is of it &s;elf immediately perceived, and various Degrees thereof are connected with
<PB N="159" REF="165">
different Di&s;tances, which never fail to accompany them into my Mind, when I view an Object di&s;tinctly with both Eyes, who&s;e Di&s;tance is &s;o &s;mall that in re&s;pect of it the Interval between the Eyes has any con&s;iderable Magnitude.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. I know it is a received Opinion, that by altering the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Eyes, the Mind perceives whether the Angle of the Optic Axes, or the lateral Angles comprehended between the Interval of the Eyes and the Optic Axes, are made greater or le&s;&s;er; and that accordingly by a kind of Natural Geometry, it judges the Point of their Inter&s;ection to be nearer, or farther off. But that this is not true, I am convinced by my own Ex|perience, &s;ince I am not con&s;cious, that I make any &s;uch u&s;e of the Perception I have by the Turn of my Eyes. And for me to make tho&s;e Judgments, and draw tho&s;e Conclu&s;ions from it, without know|ing that I do &s;o, &s;eems altogether incomprehen|&s;ible.</P>
<P N="20">XX. From all which it follows, that the Judg|ment we make of the Di&s;tance of an Object, view|ed with both Eyes, is entirely the Re&s;ult of Ex|perience. If we had not con&s;tantly found certain Sen&s;ations ari&s;ing from the various Di&s;po&s;ition of the Eyes, attended with certain Degrees of Di&s;|tance, we &s;hou'd never make tho&s;e &s;udden Judg|ments from them, concerning the Di&s;tance of Ob|jects; no more than we wou'd pretend to judge of a Man's Thoughts by his pronouncing Words we had never heard before.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. <HI>Secondly,</HI> An Object placed at a certain Di&s;tance from the Eye, to which the breadth of the Pupil bears a con&s;iderable Proportion, being made
<PB N="160" REF="166">
to approach, is &s;een more confu&s;edly: And the nearer it is brought, the more confu&s;ed Appear|ance it makes. And this being found con&s;tantly to be &s;o, there ari&s;eth in the Mind an Habitual Con|nexion between the &s;everal Degrees of Confu&s;ion and Di&s;tance; the greater Confu&s;ion &s;till imploying the le&s;&s;er Di&s;tance, and the le&s;&s;er Confu&s;ion, the greater Di&s;tance of the Object.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. This confu&s;ed Appearance of the Ob|ject doth therefore &s;eem to be the Medium, where|by the Mind judgeth of Di&s;tance in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, wherein the mo&s;t approved Writers of Optics will have it judge by the different Divergency, with which the Rays flowing from the Radiating Point fall on the Pupil. No Man, I believe, will pre|tend to &s;ee or feel tho&s;e imaginary Angles, that the Rays are &s;uppo&s;ed to form according to their various Inclinations on his Eye. But he cannot choo&s;e Seeing whether the Object appear more or le&s;s confu&s;ed. It is therefore a manife&s;t Con&s;e|quence from what has been demon&s;trated, that in|&s;tead of the greater, or le&s;&s;er Divergency of the Rays, the Mind makes u&s;e of the greater or le&s;&s;er Confu&s;edne&s;s of the Appearance, thereby to deter|mine the apparent Place of an Object.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. Nor doth it avail to &s;ay, there is not any nece&s;&s;ary Connexion between confu&s;ed Vi&s;ion, and Di&s;tance, great or &s;mall. For I ask any Man, what nece&s;&s;ary Connexion he &s;ees between the Red|ne&s;s of a Blu&s;h and Shame? And yet no &s;ooner &s;hall he behold that Colour to ari&s;e in the Face of another, but it brings into his Mind the Idea of that Pa&s;&s;ion which hath been ob&s;erved to accompa|ny it.</P>
<P N="24"><PB N="161" REF="167">
XXIV. What &s;eems to have mi&s;led the Writers of Optics in this Matter is, that they imagine Men judge of Di&s;tance, as they do of a Conclu&s;ion in Mathematics; betwixt which and the Premi&s;es it is indeed ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite there be an apparent, nece&s;&s;ary Connexion: But it is far otherwi&s;e, in the &s;udden Judgments Men make of Di&s;tance. We are not to think, that Brutes and Children, or even grown rea&s;onable Men, whenever they perceive an Object to approach, or depart from them, do it by virtue of Geometry and Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. That one Idea may &s;ugge&s;t another to the Mind, it will &s;uffice that they have been ob|&s;erved to go together, without any Demon&s;tration of the Nece&s;&s;ity of their Coexi&s;tence, or without &s;o much as knowing what it is that makes them &s;o to coexi&s;t. Of this there are innumerable In&s;tances, of which no one can be ignorant.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. Thus, greater Confu&s;ion having been con&s;tantly attended with nearer Di&s;tance, no &s;ooner is the former Idea perceived, but it &s;ugge&s;ts the latter to our Thoughts. And if it had been the ordinary Cour&s;e of Nature, that the farther off an Object were placed, the more confu&s;ed it &s;hou'd appear, it is certain, the very &s;ame Perception, that now makes us think an Object approaches, would then have made us to imagine it went far|ther off. That Perception, ab&s;tracting from Cu&s;tom and Experience, being equally fitted to produce the Idea of great Di&s;tance, or &s;mall Di&s;tance, or no Di&s;tance at all.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> An Object being placed at the Di&s;tance above &s;pecified, and brought nearer to the Eye, we may neverthele&s;s prevent, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time, the Appearance's growing more
<PB N="162" REF="168">
confu&s;ed, by &s;training the Eye. In which Ca&s;e, that Sen&s;ation &s;upplys the place of confu&s;ed Vi&s;ion, in aiding the Mind to judge of the Di&s;tance of the Object; it being e&s;teemed &s;o much the nearer, by how much the Effort or Straining of the Eye in order to di&s;tinct Vi&s;ion is greater.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. I have here &s;et down tho&s;e Sen&s;ations or Ideas, that &s;eem to be the con&s;tant and general Occa&s;ions of introducing into the Mind the different Ideas of near Di&s;tance. It is true in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, that divers other Circum&s;tances contribute to frame our Idea of Di&s;tance, to wit, the particular Num|ber, Size, Kind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the things &s;een. Concern|ing which, as well as all other the forementioned Occa&s;ions which &s;ugge&s;t Di&s;tance, I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, they have none of them, in their own Na|ture, any Relation or Connexion with it: Nor is it po&s;&s;ible, they &s;hou'd ever &s;ignify the various De|grees thereof, otherwi&s;e than as by Experience they have been found to be connected with them.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. I &s;hall proceed upon the&s;e Principles to account for a Phaenomenon, which has hitherto &s;trangely puzzled the Writers of Optics, and is &s;o far from being accounted for by any of their The|ories of Vi&s;ion, that it is, by their own Confe&s;&s;ion, plainly repugnant to them: And of Con&s;equence, if nothing el&s;e cou'd be objected, were alone &s;uf|ficient to bring their Credit in Que&s;tion. The whole Difficulty I &s;hall lay before you in the Words of the Learned Dr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> with which he concludes his Optic Lectures.</P>

And &s;uppo&s;e the Point of Union <HI>(i. e.</HI> the Image of the Point A, as hath been already &s;et forth) to be <HI>Z;</HI> between which and B, the Vertex of the Gla&s;s or Speculum, conceive the Eye to be any where placed. The Que&s;tion now is, where the Point A ought to appear? Ex|perience &s;hews that it doth not appear behind at the Point <HI>Z,</HI> and it were contrary to Na|ture that it &s;hou'd; &s;ince all the Impre&s;&s;ion which affects the Sen&s;e comes from towards A. But from our Tenets it &s;hou'd &s;eem to follow that it wou'd appear before the Eye at a va&s;t Di&s;tance off, &s;o great as &s;hou'd in &s;ome Sort &s;urpa&s;s all &s;en&s;ible Di&s;tance. For Since if we exclude all Anticipa|tions and Prejudices, every Object appears by &s;o much the farther off, by how much the Rays it &s;ends to the Eye are le&s;s Diverging. And that Object is thought to be mo&s;t remote, from which Parallel Rays proceed unto the Eye. Rea&s;on wou'd make one think, that Object &s;hou'd appear, at yet a greater Di&s;tance, which is &s;een by con|verging Rays. Moreover it may in general be asked concerning this Ca&s;e, what it is that de|termines the apparent Place of the Point A, and maketh it to appear after a con&s;tant manner, &s;ometimes nearer, at other times farther off? To which Doubt, I &s;ee nothing that can be an&s;wer'd
<PB N="167" REF="173">
agreeable to the Principles we have laid down, except only that the Point A ought always to appear extremely remote. But on the contrary, we are a&s;&s;ur'd by Experience that the Point A appears variou&s;ly di&s;tant, according to the diffe|rent Situations of the Eye between the Points B and <HI>Z.</HI> And that it doth almo&s;t never (if at all) &s;eem farther off, than it wou'd if it were be|held by the naked Eye, but on the contrary, it doth &s;ometimes appear much nearer. Nay, it is even certain, that by how much the Rays fall|ing on the Eye do more converge, by &s;o much the nearer does the Object &s;eem to approach. For the Eye being placed clo&s;e to the Point B, the Object A appears nearly in its own natural Place, if the Point B is taken in the Gla&s;s, or at the &s;ame Di&s;tance, if in the Speculum. The Eye being brought back to O, the Object &s;eems to draw near: And being come to P it beholds it &s;till nearer. And &s;o on by little and little, till at length the Eye being placed &s;omewhere, &s;up|po&s;e at Q, the Object appearing extremely near, begins to vani&s;h into meer Confu&s;ion. All which doth &s;eem repugnant to our Principles, at lea&s;t, not rightly to agree with them. Nor is our Tenet alone &s;truck at by this Experiment, but likewi&s;e all others that ever came to my Know|ledge are, every whit as much, endanger'd by it. The ancient one e&s;pecially (which is mo&s;t com|monly received, and comes neare&s;t to mine) &s;eems to be &s;o effectually overthrown thereby, that the mo&s;t learned <HI>Tacquet</HI> has been forced to reject that Principle, as fal&s;e and uncertain, on which alone he had built almo&s;t his whole Catoptrics, and con&s;equently by taking away the Foundation, hath him&s;elf pulled down the Super&s;tructure he had rai&s;ed on it. Which, neverthele&s;s, I do not believe he wou'd have done, had he but con&s;i|der'd
<PB N="168" REF="174">
the whole matter more throughly, and ex|amined the Difficulty to the bottom. But as for me, neither this, nor any other Difficulty &s;hall have &s;o great an Influence on me, as to make me renounce that which I know to be manife&s;tly a|greeable to Rea&s;on: E&s;pecially when, as it here falls out, the Difficulty is founded in the peculi|ar Nature of a certain odd and particular Ca&s;e. For in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e &s;omething peculiar lies hid, which being involved in the Subtilty of Na|ture will, perhaps, hardly be di&s;covered till &s;uch Time, as the manner of Vi&s;ion is more perfectly made known. Concerning which, I mu&s;t own, I have hitherto been able to find out nothing that has the lea&s;t &s;hew of Probability, not to mention Certainty. I &s;hall, therefore, leave this Knot to be untied by you, wi&s;hing you may have better Succe&s;s in it than I have had.</Q></P>
<P N="30">XXX. The ancient and receiv'd Principle, which Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> here mentions as the main Foundation of <HI>Tacquet</HI>'s Catoptrics, is that <HI>every vi&s;ible Point &s;een by Reflection from a Speculum, &s;hall appear placed at the Inter&s;ection of the reflected Ray, and the Perpendicular of Incidence.</HI> Which Inter|&s;ection in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, happening to be behind the Eye, it greatly &s;hakes the Authority of that Principle, where on the aforementioned Author proceeds throughout his whole Catoptrics, in de|termining the apparent Place of Objects &s;een by Reflexion from any kind of Speculum.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. Let us now &s;ee how this Phaenomenon agrees with our Tenets. The Eye the nearer it is placed to the Point B in the foregoing Figures, the more di&s;tinct is the Appearance of the Object; but as it recedes to O, the Appearance grows more Confu&s;ed; and at P it &s;ees the Object yet more
<PB N="169" REF="175">
Confu&s;ed; and &s;o on till the Eye being brought back to <HI>Z</HI> &s;ees the Object in the greate&s;t Confu&s;i|on of all. Wherefore by SECT. XXI. the Object &s;hou'd &s;eem to approach the Eye gradually, as it recedes from the Point B, that is at O it &s;hou'd (in Con&s;equence of the Principle I have laid down in the afore&s;aid Section) &s;eem nearer than it did at B, and at P nearer than at O, and at Q nearer than at P; and &s;o on, till it quite vani&s;hes at Z. Which is the very matter of Fact, as any one that plea&s;es may ea&s;ily &s;atisfy him&s;elf by Experiment.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. This Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame, as if we &s;hou'd &s;uppo&s;e an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to meet a Foreigner, who u&s;ed the &s;ame Words with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but in a direct contrary Signification. The <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> wou'd not fail to make a wrong Judgment of the Ideas annexed to tho&s;e Sounds, in the Mind of him that u&s;ed them. Ju&s;t &s;o, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e the Object &s;peaks (if I may &s;o &s;ay) with Words that the Eye is well acquainted with, that is, Confu&s;ions of Appearance; but whereas heretofore the greater Confu&s;ions were always wont to &s;ignify nearer Di&s;tances, they have in this Ca&s;e a direct, contrary Signification, being connected with the greater Di&s;tances. Whence it follows, that the Eye mu&s;t unavoidably be mi&s;taken, &s;ince it will take the Confu&s;ions in the Sen&s;e it has been u&s;ed to, which is directly oppo&s;ed to the True.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. This Phaenomenon as it entirely &s;ub|verts the Opinion of tho&s;e, who will have us judge of Di&s;tance by Lines and Angles, on which Sup|po&s;ition it is altogether inexplicable, &s;o it &s;eems to me no &s;mall Confirmation of the Truth of that Principle whereby it is explain'd. But in order to a more full Explication of this Point, and to &s;hew how far the Hypothe&s;is of the Mind's judg|ing
<PB N="170" REF="176">
by the various Divergency of Rays, may be of u&s;e in determining the apparent Place of an Object, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e &s;ome few Things, which are already well known to tho&s;e who have any Skill in Dioptrics.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Any radiating Point is then di&s;tinctly &s;een when the Rays proceeding from it are, by the refractive Power of the Cry&s;talline, ac|curately reunited in the Retina or Fund of the Eye: But if they are reunited, either before they arrive at the Retina, or after they have pa&s;t it, then there is confu&s;ed Vi&s;ion.</P>

its natural Figure. In Fig. 1. the Rays falling nearly Parallel on the Eye, are by the Cry|&s;talline AB refracted, &s;o as their Focus or Point of Union F falls exactly on the Retina: But if the Rays fall &s;en&s;ibly diverging on the Eye, as in Fig. 2. then their Focus falls beyond the Retina: Or if the Rays are made to converge by the Lens QS, before they come at the Eye, as in Fig. 3. their Focus F will fall before the Retina. In which two la&s;t Ca&s;es, it is evident from the fore|going Section, that the Appearance of the Point <HI>Z</HI> is confu&s;ed. And by how much the greater is the Convergency, or Divergency of the Rays fall|ing on the Pupil, by &s;o much the farther will the Point of their Reunion be from the Retina, either before or behind it, and con&s;equently the Point <HI>Z</HI> will appear, by &s;o much the more confu&s;ed. And this by the bye, may &s;hew us the Difference be|tween confu&s;ed, and faint Vi&s;ion. Confu&s;ed Vi&s;ion is, when the Rays proceeding from each di&s;tinct Point of the Object are not accurately recollected in one corre&s;ponding Point on the Retina, but take up &s;ome Space thereon: So that Rays from dif|ferent Points become mixed, and confu&s;ed together. This is oppo&s;ed to a di&s;tinct Vi&s;ion, and attends near Objects. Faint Vi&s;ion is, when by rea&s;on of the Di&s;tance of the Object or Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the in|terjacent Medium few Rays arrive from the Object to the Eye. This is oppo&s;ed to vigorous or clear Vi&s;ion, and attends remote Objects. But to re|turn.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. The Eye, or (to &s;peak truly) the Mind perceiving only the Confu&s;ion it &s;elf, with|out ever con&s;idering the Cau&s;e from which it pro|ceeds, doth con&s;tantly annex the &s;ame Degree of Di&s;tance to the &s;ame Degree of Confu&s;ion.
<PB N="172" REF="178">
Whether that Confu&s;ion be occa&s;ioned by converging, or by diverging Rays, it matters not. Whence it follows, that the Eye viewing the Object <HI>Z</HI> through the Gla&s;s QS (which by Refraction cau&s;eth the Rays ZQ, ZS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to converge) &s;hou'd judge it to be at &s;uch a Nearne&s;s, at which if it were placed, it wou'd radiate on the Eye with Rays diverging to that Degree, as wou'd produce the &s;ame Confu&s;ion, which is now pro|duced by Converging Rays, <HI>i. e.</HI> wou'd cover a Portion of the Retina equal to DC. <HI>vid. Fig.</HI> 3. <HI>&s;upra.</HI> But then this mu&s;t be under&s;tood (to u&s;e Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI>'s Phra&s;e) <HI>&s;eclu&s;is praenotionibus &amp; praeju|diciis,</HI> in ca&s;e we ab&s;tract from all other Circum|&s;tances of Vi&s;ion, &s;uch as the Figure, Size, Faint|ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the vi&s;ible Objects; all which do or|dinarily concur to form our Idea of Di&s;tance, the Mind having by frequent Experience ob&s;erved their &s;everal Sorts or Degrees, to be connected with va|rious Di&s;tances.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. It plainly follows from what hath been &s;aid, that a Per&s;on perfectly Purblind <HI>(i. e.</HI> that cou'd not &s;ee an Object di&s;tinctly, but when placed clo&s;e to his Eye) wou'd not make the &s;ame wrong Judgment that others do, in the foremen|tioned Ca&s;e. For, to him, greater Confu&s;ions con|&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ting greater Di&s;tances, he mu&s;t, as he recedes from the Gla&s;s, and the Object grows more Confu&s;ed, judge it to be at a farther Di&s;tance con|trary to what they do, who have had the Percep|tion of the Objects growing more confu&s;ed, con|nected with the Idea of Approach.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. Hence al&s;o it doth appear, there may be good u&s;e of Computation by Lines and Angles in Optics; not that the Mind judgeth of Di&s;tance immediately by them, but becau&s;e it judg|eth
<PB N="173" REF="179">
by &s;omewhat which is connected with them, and to the Determination whereof they may be &s;ub&s;ervient. Thus the Mind judging of the Di|&s;tance of an Object, by the Confu&s;edne&s;s of its Ap|pearance, and this Confu&s;edne&s;s being greater or le&s;&s;er to the naked Eye, according as the Object is &s;een by Rays more or le&s;s diverging, it follows, that a Man may make u&s;e of the Divergency of the Rays in computing the apparent Di&s;tance, though not for its own &s;ake, yet on account of the Confu&s;ion with which it is connected. But, &s;o it is, the Confu&s;ion it &s;elf is intirely neglected by Mathematicians, as having no nece&s;&s;ary Relation with Di&s;tance, &s;uch as the greater or le&s;&s;er Angles of Divergency are conceived to have. And the&s;e (e&s;pecially for that they fall under Mathematical Computation) are alone regarded, in determin|ing the apparent Places of Objects, as though they were the &s;ole and immediate Cau&s;e of the Judgments the Mind makes of Di&s;tance. Whereas, in Truth, they &s;hou'd not at all be regarded in them&s;elves, or any otherwi&s;e, than as they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Cau&s;e of Confu&s;ed Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. The not con&s;idering of this has been a fundamental and perplexing Over&s;ight. For Proof whereof, we need go no farther than the Ca&s;e be|fore us. It having been ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t diverging Rays brought into the Mind the Idea of neare&s;t Di&s;tance, and that &s;till, as the Divergency decrea&s;ed, the Di&s;tance increa&s;ed: and it being thought, the Connexion between the various De|grees of Divergency and Di&s;tance, was immediate, this naturally leads one to conclude, from an ill grounded Analogy, that converging Rays &s;hall make an Object appear at an immen&s;e Di&s;tance: And that, as the Convergency increa&s;es, the Di|&s;tance (if it were po&s;&s;ible) &s;hou'd do &s;o likewi&s;e.
<PB N="174" REF="180">
That this was the Cau&s;e of Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI>'s Mi&s;take, is evident from his own Words which we have quoted. Whereas had the learned Doctor ob&s;erv'd, that diverging and converging Rays, how oppo&s;ite &s;oever they may &s;eem, do neverthele&s;s agree in producing the &s;ame Effect, to wit, Confu&s;edne&s;s of Vi&s;ion, greater Degrees whereof are produced in|differently, either as the Divergency or Conver|gency of the Rays increa&s;eth. And that it is by this Effect, which is the &s;ame in both, that either the Divergency or Convergency is perceived by the Eye; I &s;ay had he but con&s;ider'd this, it is certain he would have made a quite contrary Judg|ment, and rightly concluded, that tho&s;e Rays which fall on the Eye with greater Degrees of Convergency &s;hou'd make the Object from whence they proceed, appear by &s;o much the nearer. But it is plain, it was impo&s;&s;ible for any Man to attain to a right Notion of this Matter, &s;o long as he had regard only to Lines and Angles, and did not apprehend the true Nature of Vi&s;ion, and how far it was of Mathematical Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="40">XL. Before we di&s;mi&s;s this Subject, it is fit we take notice of a Query relating thereto, propo&s;ed by the ingenious Mr. <HI>Molyneux,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of Dioptrics <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">par. I. prop. 31. Sect. 9.</NOTE>, where &s;peaking of this Difficulty, he has the&s;e Words: <Q>And &s;o he <HI>(i. e.</HI> Dr. <HI>Barrow)</HI> leaves this Difficulty to the Solution of others, which I (after &s;o great an Example) &s;hall do like|wi&s;e; but with the Re&s;olution of the &s;ame ad|mirable Author of not quitting the evident Doc|trine which we have before laid down, for de|termining the <HI>Locus Objecti,</HI> on account of being pre&s;s'd by one Difficulty, which &s;eems inexpli|cable till a more intimate Knowledge of the Vi|&s;ive
<PB N="175" REF="181">
Faculty be obtained by Mortals. In the mean time, I propo&s;e it to the Con&s;ideration of the Ingenious, Whether the <HI>Locus Apparens</HI> of an Object placed as in this 9th Section, be not as much before the Eye, as the di&s;tinct Ba&s;e is be|hind the Eye?</Q> To which Query we may ven|ture to an&s;wer in the Negative. For in the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e, the Rule for determining the Di&s;tance of the di&s;tinct Ba&s;e, or re&s;pective Focus from the Gla&s;s is this: <HI>As the Difference between the Di&s;tance of the Object and Focus is to the Focus or Focal Length, &s;o the Di&s;tance of the Object from the Gla&s;s is to the Di&s;tance of the re&s;pective Focus or di&s;tinct Ba&s;e from the Gla&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Molyneux Dioptr. par. I. prop. 5.</NOTE>. Let us now &s;uppo&s;e the Object to be placed at the Di&s;tance of the Focal Length, and one half of the Focal Length from the Gla&s;s, and the Eye clo&s;e to the Gla&s;s, hence it will follow by the Rule, that the Di&s;tance of the di&s;tinct Ba&s;e behind the Eye is double the true Di&s;tance of the Object before the Eye. If therefore Mr. <HI>Molyneux</HI>'s Conjecture held good, it wou'd follow that the Eye &s;hou'd &s;ee the Object, twice as far off as it really is; and in other Ca&s;es at three or four times its due Di&s;tance, or more. But this manife&s;tly contradicts Experience, the Object never appear|ing, at farthe&s;t, beyond its due Di&s;tance. What ever therefore is built on this Suppo&s;ition <HI>(vid. Corol.</HI> 1. <HI>Prop.</HI> 57. <HI>ibid.)</HI> comes to the Ground along with it.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. From what hath been premis'd, it is a manife&s;t Con&s;equence, that a Man born blind, be|ing made to &s;ee, wou'd, at fir&s;t, have no Idea of Di&s;tance by Sight; The Sun and Stars, the remo|te&s;t Objects as well as the nearer wou'd all &s;eem to be in his Eye, or rather in his Mind. The Ob|jects
<PB N="176" REF="182">
intromitted by Sight, wou'd &s;eem to him (as in truth they are) no other than a new Set of Thoughts or Sen&s;ations, each whereof is as near to him, as the Perceptions of Pain or Plea&s;ure, or the mo&s;t inward Pa&s;&s;ions of his Soul. For our judg|ing Objects perceiv'd by Sight to be at any Di&s;|tance, or without the Mind, is <HI>(vid.</HI> SECT. XXVIII.) intirely the Effect of Experience, which one in tho&s;e Circum&s;tances cou'd not yet have attained to.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. It is indeed otherwi&s;e upon the common Suppo&s;ition, that Men judge of Di&s;tance by the Angle of the Optic Axes, ju&s;t as one in the Dark, or a Blind-man by the Angle comprehended by two Sticks, one whereof he held in each Hand. For if this were true, it wou'd follow that one blind from his Birth being made to &s;ee, &s;hou'd &s;tand in need of no new Experience, in order to perceive Di&s;tance by Sight. But that this is fal&s;e, has, I think, been &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. And perhaps upon a &s;trict Inquiry, we &s;hall not find that even tho&s;e, who from their Birth have grown up in a continu'd Habit of Seeing, are irrecoverably prejudiced on the other &s;ide, to wit, in thinking what they &s;ee to be at a Di&s;tance from them. For at this time it &s;eems agreed on all hands, by tho&s;e who have had any Thoughts of that Matter, that Colours, which are the proper and immediate Object of Sight, are not without the Mind. But then it will be &s;aid, by Sight we have al&s;o the Ideas of Exten&s;ion, and Figure, and Mo|tion; all which may well be thought without, and at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Mind, though Colour &s;hou'd not. In an&s;wer to this, I appeal to any Man's Experience, whether the vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion of any Object doth not appear as near to him, as
<PB N="177" REF="183">
the Colour of that Object; Nay, whether they do not both &s;eem to be in the very &s;ame Place. Is not the Exten&s;ion we &s;ee Coloured, and is it po&s;&s;i|ble for us, &s;o much as in Thought, to &s;eparate and ab&s;tract Colour from Exten&s;ion? Now, where the Exten&s;ion is, there &s;urely is the Figure, and there the Motion too. I &s;peak of tho&s;e which are per|ceived by Sight.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. But for a fuller Explication of this Point, and to &s;hew that the immediate Objects of Sight are not &s;o much as the Ideas or Re&s;emblan|ces of things placed at a Di&s;tance, it is requi&s;ite that we look nearer into the Matter, and carefully ob&s;erve what is meant in common Di&s;cour&s;e, when one &s;ays, that which he &s;ees is at a Di&s;tance from him. Suppo&s;e, for Example, that looking at the Moon I &s;hou'd &s;ay it were fifty or &s;ixty Semidia|meters of the Earth di&s;tant from me. Let us &s;ee what Moon this is &s;poken of: It is plain it cannot be the vi&s;ible Moon, or any thing like the vi&s;ible Moon, or that which I &s;ee, which is only a round, luminous Plain, of about thirty vi&s;ible Points in Diameter. For in ca&s;e I am carried from the place where I &s;tand directly towards the Moon, it is mani|fe&s;t the Object varies, &s;till as I go on; and by the time that I am advanced fifty or &s;ixty Semidiameters of the Earth, I &s;hall be &s;o far from being near a &s;mall, round, luminous Flat, that I &s;hall perceive nothing like it; this Object having long &s;ince di&s;appeared, and if I wou'd recover it, it mu&s;t be by going back to the Earth from whence I &s;et out. Again, &s;up|po&s;e I perceive by Sight the faint and ob&s;cure Idea of &s;omething, which I doubt whether it be a Man, or a Tree, or a Tower, but judge it to be at the Di&s;tance of about a Mile. 'Tis plain I cannot mean, that what I &s;ee is a Mile off, or that it is the Image or Likene&s;s of any thing which is a Mile off, &s;ince
<PB N="178" REF="184">
that every Step I take towards it, the Appearance alters, and from being ob&s;cure, &s;mall, and faint, grows clear, large and vigorous. And when I come to the Mile's end, that which I &s;aw fir&s;t is quite lo&s;t, neither do I find any thing in the like|ne&s;s of it.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. In the&s;e and the like In&s;tances, the truth of the Matter &s;tands thus: Having of a long time experienced certain Ideas, perceivable by Touch, as Di&s;tance, tangible Figure, and Solidity, to have been connected with certain Ideas of Sight, I do upon perceiving the&s;e Ideas of Sight, forth|with conclude what Tangible Ideas are, by the wonted ordinary cour&s;e of Nature, like to follow. Looking at an Object I perceive a certain vi&s;ible Figure and Colour, with &s;ome degree of Faintne&s;s and other Circum&s;tances, which from what I have formerly ob&s;erved, determine me to think, that if I advance forward &s;o many Paces or Miles, I &s;hall be affected with &s;uch and &s;uch Ideas of Touch: So that in truth and &s;trictne&s;s of Speech, I neither &s;ee Di&s;tance it &s;elf, nor any thing that I take to be at a Di&s;tance. I &s;ay, neither Di&s;tance, nor things placed at a Di&s;tance are them&s;elves, or their Ideas, truly perceived by Sight. This I am per&s;uaded of, as to what concerns my &s;elf; and I believe whoever will look narrowly into his own Thoughts, and examine what he means by &s;aying, he &s;ees this or that thing at a Di&s;tance, will agree with me, that what he &s;ees only &s;ugge&s;ts to his Under&s;tanding, that after having pa&s;&s;ed a certain Di&s;tance, to be mea&s;ured by the Motion of his Body, which is perceivable by Touch, he &s;hall come to perceive &s;uch and &s;uch tangible Ideas which have been u&s;u|ally connected with &s;uch and &s;uch vi&s;ible Ideas. But that one might be deceived by the&s;e &s;ugge&s;ti|ons of Sen&s;e, and that there is no nece&s;&s;ary Con|nexion
<PB N="179" REF="185">
between vi&s;ible and tangible Ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by them, we need go no farther than the next Looking-gla&s;s or Picture to be convinced. Note, that when I &s;peak of Tangible Ideas, I take the word Idea for any the immediate Object of Sen&s;e, or Under&s;tanding, in which large Signification it is commonly u&s;ed by the Moderns.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. From what we have &s;hewn it is a mani|fe&s;t Con&s;equence, that the Ideas of Space, Outne&s;s, and Things placed at a Di&s;tance, are not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the Object of Sight; they are not other|wi&s;e perceived by the Eye than by the Ear. Sit|ting in my Study I hear a Coach drive along the Street; I look through the Ca&s;ement and &s;ee it; I walk out and enter into it; thus, common Speech wou'd incline one to think, I heard, &s;aw, and touch'd the &s;ame thing, to wit, the Coach. It is neverthele&s;s certain, the Ideas intromitted by each Sen&s;e are widely different, and di&s;tinct from each other; but having been ob&s;erved con&s;tantly to go together, they are &s;poken of as one and the &s;ame thing. By the variation of the Noi&s;e I perceive the different Di&s;tances of the Coach, and know that it approaches before I look out. Thus by the Ear I perceive Di&s;tance, ju&s;t after the &s;ame manner as I do by the Eye.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. I do not neverthele&s;s &s;ay, I hear Di&s;|tance in like manner as I &s;ay that I &s;ee it, the Ide|as perceived by Hearing not being &s;o apt to be confounded with the Ideas of Touch, as tho&s;e of Sight are; &s;o likewi&s;e a Man is ea&s;ily convinced that Bodies and external Things are not properly the Object of Hearing, but only Sounds, by the Mediation whereof the Idea of this or that Body, or Di&s;tance is &s;ugge&s;ted to his Thoughts. But then one is with more difficulty brought to di&s;cern
<PB N="180" REF="186">
the Difference there is betwixt the Ideas of Sight and Touch: Though it be certain, a Man no more &s;ees or feels the &s;ame thing, than he hears and feels the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P N="48">XLVIII. One Rea&s;on of which &s;eems to be this. It is thought a great Ab&s;urdity to imagine, that one and the &s;ame thing &s;hou'd have any more than one Exten&s;ion, and one Figure. But the Exten&s;ion and Figure of a Body, being let into the Mind two ways, and that indifferently, either by Sight or Touch, it &s;eems to follow that we &s;ee the &s;ame Exten&s;ion, and the &s;ame Figure which we feel.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. But if we take a clo&s;e and accurate View of Things, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that we never &s;ee and feel one and the &s;ame Object. That which is &s;een is one thing, and that which is felt is ano|ther; if the vi&s;ible Figure and Exten&s;ion be not the &s;ame with the tangible Figure and Exten&s;ion, we are not to infer that one and the &s;ame thing has divers Exten&s;ions. The true Con&s;equence is, that the Objects of Sight and Touch are two di&s;|tinct things. It may perhaps require &s;ome Thought rightly to conceive this Di&s;tinction. And the Difficulty &s;eems not a little increa&s;ed, becau&s;e the Combination of Vi&s;ible Ideas hath con&s;tantly the &s;ame Name, as the Combination of Tangible Ideas wherewith it is connected: Which doth of nece&s;&s;i|ty ari&s;e from the u&s;e and end of Language.</P>
<P N="50">L. In order therefore to treat accurately and unconfu&s;edly of Vi&s;ion, we mu&s;t bear in mind that there are two &s;orts of Objects apprehended by the Eye, the one primarily and immediately, the other &s;econdarily and by Intervention of the former.
<PB N="181" REF="187">
Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;ort neither are, nor appear to be without the Mind, or at any Di&s;tance off; they may indeed grow greater, or &s;maller, more con|fu&s;ed, or more clear, or more faint, but they do not, cannot appraoch or recede from us. When|ever we &s;ay an Object is at a Di&s;tance, whenever we &s;ay it draws near, or goes farther off, we mu&s;t always mean it of the latter &s;ort, which properly belong to the Touch, and are not &s;o truly per|ceived, as &s;ugge&s;ted by the Eye in like manner as Thoughts by the Ear.</P>
<P N="51">LI. No &s;ooner do we hear the Words of a fa|miliar Language pronounced in our Ears, but the Ideas corre&s;ponding thereto pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our Minds; in the very &s;ame in&s;tant the Sound and the Meaning enter the Under&s;tanding: So clo&s;ely are they united, that it is not in our Power to keep out the one, except we exclude the other al&s;o. We even act in all re&s;pects as if we heard the very Thoughts them&s;elves. So likewi&s;e the &s;econdary Objects, or tho&s;e which are only &s;ug|ge&s;ted by Sight, do often more &s;trongly affect us, and are more regarded than the proper Objects of that Sen&s;e; along with which they enter into the Mind, and with which they have a far more &s;trict Connexion, than Ideas have with Words. Hence it is, we find it &s;o difficult to di&s;criminate between the immediate and mediate Objects of Sight, and are &s;o prone to attribute to the former, what be|longs only to the latter. They are, as it were, mo&s;t clo&s;ely twi&s;ted, blended, and incorporated together. And the Prejudice is confirmed and ri|veted in our Thoughts by a long tract of Time, by the u&s;e of Language, and want of Reflexion. However, I believe any one that &s;hall attentively con&s;ider what we have already &s;aid, and &s;hall &s;ay upon this Subject before we have done, (e&s;pecially
<PB N="182" REF="188">
if he pur&s;ue it in his own Thoughts) may be able to deliver him&s;elf from that Prejudice. Sure I am 'tis worth &s;ome Attention, to whoever wou'd un|der&s;tand the true nature of Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="52">LII. I have now done with Di&s;tance, and pro|ceed to &s;hew how it is, that we perceive by Sight the Magnitude of Objects. It is the Opinion of &s;ome that we do it by Angles, or by Angles in con|junction with Di&s;tance; but neither Angles, nor Di&s;tance being perceivable by Sight, and the things we &s;ee being in truth at no Di&s;tance from us, it follows, that as we have &s;hewn Lines and Angles not to be the Medium, the Mind makes u&s;e of in apprehending the Apparent Place, &s;o neither are they the Medium whereby it apprehends the Ap|parent Magnitude of Objects.</P>
<P N="53">LIII. It is well known that the &s;ame Exten&s;ion at a near Di&s;tance &s;hall &s;ubtend a greater Angle, and at a farther Di&s;tance, a le&s;&s;er Angle. And by this Principle (we are told) the Mind e&s;timates the Magnitude of an Object comparing the Angle un|der which it is &s;een with its Di&s;tance, and thence inferring the Magnitude thereof. What inclines Men to this Mi&s;take (be&s;ide the Humour of mak|ing one &s;ee by Geometry is, that the &s;ame Percep|tions or Ideas which &s;ugge&s;t Di&s;tance, do al&s;o &s;ug|ge&s;t Magnitude. But if we examine it, we &s;hall find they &s;ugge&s;t the latter, as immediately as the former. I &s;ay, they do not fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;t Di&s;tance, and then leave it to the Judgment to u&s;e that as a Medium, whereby to collect the Magnitude; but they have as clo&s;e, and immediate a Connexion with the Magnitude, as with the Di&s;tance; and &s;ugge&s;t Magnitude as independently of Di&s;tance, as they do Di&s;tance independently of Magnitude. All
<PB N="183" REF="189">
which will be evident to whoever con&s;iders what hath been already &s;aid, and what follows.</P>
<P N="54">LIV. It hath been &s;hewn, there are two &s;orts of Objects apprehended by Sight; each whereof hath its di&s;tinct Magnitude, or Exten&s;ion. The one, properly Tangible, <HI>i. e.</HI> to be perceived and mea|&s;ured by Touch, and not immediately falling un|der the Sen&s;e of &s;eeing: The other, properly and immediately Vi&s;ible, by Mediation of which the former is brought in View. Each of the&s;e Mag|nitudes are greater or le&s;&s;er, according as they con|tain in them more or fewer Points, they being made up of Points or Minimums. For, whatever may be &s;aid of Exten&s;ion in Ab&s;tract, it is certain &s;en&s;ible Exten&s;ion is not infinitely Divi&s;ible. There is a <HI>Minimum Tangibile,</HI> and a <HI>Minimum Vi&s;ibile,</HI> be|yond which Sen&s;e cannot perceive. This every one's Experience will inform him.</P>
<P N="55">LV. The Magnitude of the Object which exi&s;ts without the Mind, and is at a Di&s;tance, continues always invariably the &s;ame: But the Vi&s;ible Object &s;till changing as you approach to, or recede from the Tangible Object, it hath no fixed and deter|minate Greatne&s;s. Whenever therefore, we &s;peak of the Magnitude of any thing, for In&s;tance a Tree or a Hou&s;e, we mu&s;t mean the Tangible Magni|tude, otherwi&s;e there can be nothing &s;teady and free from Ambiguity &s;poken of it. But though the Tangible and Vi&s;ible Magnitude in truth be|long to two di&s;tinct Objects: I &s;hall neverthele&s;s (e&s;pecially &s;ince tho&s;e Objects are called by the &s;ame Name, and are ob&s;erved to coexi&s;t) to avoid tediou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ingularity of Speech, &s;ometimes &s;peak of them, as belonging to one and the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P N="56"><PB N="184" REF="190">
LVI. Now in order to di&s;cover by what means, the Magnitude of Tangible Objects is perceived by Sight; I need only reflect on what pa&s;&s;es in my own Mind, and ob&s;erve what tho&s;e things be, which introduce the Ideas of greater or le&s;&s;er into my Thoughts, when I look on any Object. And the&s;e I find to be, Fir&s;t, the Magnitude or Exten|&s;ion of the Vi&s;ible Object, which being immediate|ly perceived by &s;ight, is connected with that o|ther which is Tangible, and placed at a Di&s;tance. Secondly, The Confu&s;ion or Di&s;tinctne&s;s. And Thirdly, the Vigorou&s;ne&s;s or Faintne&s;s of the afore|&s;aid Vi&s;ible Appearance. <HI>Caeteris paribus,</HI> by how much the greater or le&s;&s;er, the Vi&s;ible Object is, by &s;o much the greater or le&s;&s;er, do I conclude the Tangible Object to be. But, be the Idea imme|diately perceived by Sight never &s;o large, yet if it be withal Confu&s;ed, I judge the Magnitude of the thing to be but &s;mall. If it be Di&s;tinct and Clear, I judge it greater. And if it be Faint, I appre|hend it to be yet greater. What is here meant, by Confu&s;ion and Faintne&s;s, hath been explained in SECT. XXXV.</P>
<P N="57">LVII. Moreover the Judgments we make of Greatne&s;s do, in like manner as tho&s;e of Di&s;tance, depend on the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Eye, al&s;o on the Figure, Number and Situation of Objects and o|ther Circum&s;tances that have been ob&s;erv'd to at|tend great, or &s;mall Tangible Magnitudes. Thus, for In&s;tance, the very &s;ame Quantity of Vi&s;ible Ex|ten&s;ion, which in the Figure of a Tower, doth &s;ugge&s;t the Idea of great Magnitude, &s;hall, in the Figure of a Man &s;ugge&s;t the Idea of much &s;maller Magnitude. That this is owing to the Experi|ence we have had of the u&s;ual Bigne&s;s of a Tower and a Man, no one, I &s;uppo&s;e, need be told.</P>
<P N="58">LVIII. It is al&s;o evident, that Confu&s;ion or Faintne&s;s, have no more a nece&s;&s;ary Connexion
<PB N="185" REF="191">
with little or great Magnitude, than they have with little or great Di&s;tance. As they &s;ugge&s;t the latter, &s;o they &s;ugge&s;t the former to our Minds. And by Con&s;equence, if it were not for Experi|ence, we &s;hou'd no more judge a faint or confu&s;ed Appearance to be connected with great or little Magnitude, than we &s;hou'd that it was connected with great or little Di&s;tance.</P>
<P N="59">LIX. Nor will it be found, that great or &s;mall Vi&s;ible Magnitude hath any nece&s;&s;ary Relation to great or &s;mall Tangible Magnitude: So that the one may certainly be infer'd from the other. But, before we come to the Proof of this, it is fit we con&s;ider the Difference there is betwixt the Exten&s;ion and Figure which is the proper Object of Touch, and that other which is termed Vi&s;ible; and how the former is principally, though not im|mediately taken notice of, when we look at any Object. This has been before mentioned, but we &s;hall here inquire into the Cau&s;e thereof. We regard the Objects that environ us, in proportion as they are adapted to benefit or injure our own Bodies, and thereby produce in our Minds the Sen&s;ations of Plea&s;ure or Pain. Now Bodies ope|rating on our Organs, by an immediate Applica|tion, and the Hurt or Advantage ari&s;ing there|from, depending altogether on the Tangible, and not at all on the Vi&s;ible, Qualities of any Object: This is a plain Rea&s;on, why tho&s;e &s;hou'd be re|garded by us much more than the&s;e; and for this End, the Vi&s;ive Sen&s;e &s;eems to have been be&s;tow|ed on Animals, to wit, that by the Perception of Vi&s;ible Ideas (which in them&s;elves are not capable of affecting, or any wi&s;e altering the Frame of their Bodies) they may be able to fore&s;ee (from the Experience they have had, what Tangible Ideas are connected with &s;uch, and &s;uch Vi&s;ible Ideas)
<PB N="186" REF="192">
the Damage or Benefit which is like to en&s;ue, up|on the Application of their own Bodies to this or that Body which is at a Di&s;tance. Which Fore|&s;ight, how nece&s;&s;ary it is to the pre&s;ervation of an Animal, every one's Experience can inform him. Hence it is, that when we look at an Object, the Tangible Figure and Exten&s;ion thereof are princi|pally attended to; whil&s;t there is &s;mall heed taken of the Vi&s;ible Figure and Magnitude, which, though more immediately perceived, do le&s;s con|cern us, and are not fitted to pruduce any Altera|tion in our Bodies.</P>
<P N="60">LX. That the Matter of Fact is true, will be evident to any one, who con&s;iders that a Man placed at Ten Foot Di&s;tance, is thought as great, as if he were placed at the Di&s;tance only of Five Foot; which is true, not with Relation to the Vi|&s;ible, but Tangible Greatne&s;s of the Object. The Vi&s;ible Magnitude being far greater, at one Station, than it is at the other.</P>
<P N="61">LXI. Inches, Feet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;ettled, &s;tated Lengths, whereby we mea&s;ure Objects, and e&s;ti|mate their Magnitude, we &s;ay, for Example, an Object appears to be &s;ix Inches, or Six Foot long. Now, that this cannot be meant of Vi&s;ible Inches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is evident, becau&s;e a Vi&s;ible Inch is it &s;elf no con&s;tant, determinate Magnitude, and cannot there|fore &s;erve to mark out, and determine the Magni|tude of any other thing. Take an Inch mark'd upon a Ruler; view it, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, at the di&s;tance of half a Foot, a Foot, a Foot and a Half, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the Eye: At each of which, and at all the intermediate Di&s;tances, the Inch &s;hall have a diffe|rent Vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion, <HI>i. e.</HI> there &s;hall be more or fewer Points di&s;cerned in it. Now I ask which of all the&s;e various Exten&s;ions, is that &s;tated, deter|minate
<PB N="187" REF="193">
one, that is agreed on, for a common Mea|&s;ure of other Magnitudes? No Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign|ed, why we &s;hou'd pitch on one, more than ano|ther: And except there be &s;ome invariable, deter|minate Exten&s;ion fixed on to be marked by the Word Inch, it is plain, it can be u&s;ed to little Pur|po&s;e; and to &s;ay, a Thing contains this or that Number of Inches, &s;hall imply no more than that it is extended, without bringing any particular Idea of that Exten&s;ion into the Mind. Farther, an Inch and a Foot, from different Di&s;tances, &s;hall both exhibit the &s;ame Vi&s;ible Magnitude, and yet at the &s;ame time, you &s;hall &s;ay, that one &s;eems &s;e|veral times greater than the other. From all which it is manife&s;t, that the Judgments we make of the Magnitude of Objects by Sight, are altogether in reference to their Tangible Exten&s;ion. When|ever we &s;ay an Object is Great, or Small, of this or that determinate Mea&s;ure, I &s;ay, it mu&s;t be meant of the Tangible, and not the Vi&s;ible Exten|&s;ion, which, though immediately perceived, is ne|verthele&s;s little taken notice of</P>
<P N="62">LXII. Now, that there is no nece&s;&s;ary Con|nexion, between the&s;e two Di&s;tinct Exten&s;ions is evident from hence: Becau&s;e our Eyes might have been framed in &s;uch a manner, as to be able to &s;ee nothing but what were le&s;s than the <HI>Minimum Tan|gibile.</HI> In which Ca&s;e, it is not impo&s;&s;ible we might have perceived all the immediate Objects of Sight, the very &s;ame that we do now: But unto tho&s;e Vi&s;ible Appearances, there wou'd not be connected tho&s;e different Tangible Magnitudes, that are now. Which &s;hews, the Judgments we make of the Mag|nitude of Things placed at a di&s;tance, from the va|rious Greatne&s;s of the Immediate Objects of Sight, do not ari&s;e from any E&s;&s;ential or Nece&s;&s;ary, but only
<PB N="188" REF="194">
a Cu&s;tomary Tye, which has been ob&s;erv'd between them.</P>
<P N="63">LXIII. Moreover, it is not only certain, that any Idea of Sight might not have been connected with this or that Idea of Touch, which we now ob&s;erve to accompany it: But al&s;o, that the great|er Vi&s;ible Magnitudes might have been connected with, and introduced into our Minds le&s;&s;er Tangi|ble Magnitudes, and the le&s;&s;er Vi&s;ible Magnitudes greater Tangible Magnitudes. Nay, that it actu|ally is &s;o, we have daily Experience; that Object which makes a &s;trong and large Appearance, not &s;eeming near &s;o great as another, the Vi&s;ible Mag|nitude whereof is much le&s;s, but more faint, and the Appearance upper, or which is the &s;ame thing painted lower on the <HI>Retina,</HI> which Faintne&s;s and Situation &s;ugge&s;t both greater Magnitude and greater Di&s;tance.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. From which, and from SECT. LVII. and LVIII. it is manife&s;t, that as we do not per|ceive the Magnitudes of Objects immediately by Sight, &s;o neither do we perceive them, by the Me|diation of any thing which has a nece&s;&s;ary Connex|ion with them. Tho&s;e Ideas that now &s;ugge&s;t un|to us the various Magnitudes of External Objects, before we touch them, might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ugge&s;t|ed no &s;uch thing: Or they might have &s;ignified them, in a direct contrary manner, &s;o that the very &s;ame Ideas, on the Perception whereof we judge an Object to be Small, might as well have &s;erv'd to make us conclude it Great. Tho&s;e Ideas being in their own Nature equally fitted to bring into our Minds the Idea of Small or Great, or no Size at all of outward Objects; ju&s;t as the Words of any Language are in their own Nature indifferent to &s;ignify this or that thing, or nothing at all.</P>

<P N="66">LXVI.

From which Prejudice every one, perhaps, will not find it ea&s;y to emancipate him&s;elf, by any the cleare&s;t Convictions of Rea&s;on. And there are &s;ome Grounds to think, that if there was one only invariable and univer&s;al Language in the World, and that Men were born with the Fa|culty of &s;peaking it, it wou'd be the Opinion of many, that the Ideas in other Mens Minds were properly perceived by the Ear, or had at lea&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary and in&s;eparable Tye with the Sounds that were affixed to them.

LXVII. There is a Celebrated Phaenomenon, the Solution whereof I &s;hall attempt to give, by the Principles that have been laid down, in refe|rence to the manner wherein we apprehend by Sight the Magnitude of Objects. The apparent Magnitude of the Moon when placed in the Hori|zon, is much greater than when it is in the Meri|dian. Though the Angle under which the Di|ameter of the Moon is &s;een, be not ob&s;erved grea|ter in the former Ca&s;e, than in the latter: And the Horizontal Moon doth not con&s;tantly appear of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s, but at &s;ome times &s;eemeth far greater than at others.</P>
<P N="68">LXVIII. Now in order to explain the Rea|&s;on of the Moon's appearing greater than ordinary in the Horizon, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the Par|ticles which compo&s;e our Atmo&s;phere intercept the Rays of Light proceeding from any Object to the Eye; and by how much the greater is the Portion of Atmo&s;phere, interjacent between the Object and the Eye, by &s;o much the more are the Rays intercepted; and by con&s;equence, the Ap|pearance of the Object rendered more Faint, every Object appearing more Vigorous or more Faint, in Proportion as it &s;endeth more or fewer Rays, into the Eye Now, between the Eye and the Moon, when &s;ituated in the Horizon, there lies a far greater Quan|tity of Atmo&s;phere, than there does when the Moon is in the Meridian. Whence it comes to pa&s;s, that the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon is fainter, and therefore by SECT. LVI. it &s;hou'd be thought bigger in that Situation, than in the Meridian, or in any other Elevation above the Horizon.</P>
<P N="69">LXIX. Farther, the Air being variou&s;ly im|pregnated, &s;ometimes more and &s;ometimes le&s;s
<PB N="191" REF="197">
with Vapours and Exhalations fitted to retund and intercept the Rays of Light, it follows, that the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon hath not al|ways an equal Faintne&s;s, and by Con&s;equence, that Luminary, tho' in the very &s;ame Situation, is at one time judged greater than at another.</P>
<P N="70">LXX. That we have here given the true Ac|count of the Phaenomena of the Horizontal Moon, will, I &s;uppo&s;e, be farther evident to any one from the following Con&s;iderations. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is plain, that which in this Ca&s;e &s;ugge&s;ts the Idea of greater Magnitude, mu&s;t be &s;omething which is it &s;elf per|ceived; for, that which is unperceived cannot &s;ug|ge&s;t to our Perception any other thing. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It mu&s;t be &s;omething that does not con&s;tantly re|main the &s;ame, but is &s;ubject to &s;ome Change or Variation, &s;ince the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon varies, being at one time greater than at another. And yet, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> It cannot be the vi&s;ible Figure or Magnitude, &s;ince that remains the &s;ame, or is rather le&s;&s;er, by how much the Moon is near|er to the Horizon. It remains therefore, that the true Cau&s;e is that Affection or Alteration of the Vi&s;ible Appearance, which proceeds from the greater Paucity of Rays arriving at the Eye, and which I term Faintne&s;s: Since this an&s;wers all the forementioned Conditions, and I am not con&s;cious of any other Perception that doth.</P>
<P N="71">LXXI. Add to this, that in mi&s;ty Weather it is a common Ob&s;ervation, that the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon is far larger than u&s;ual, which greatly con&s;pires with, and &s;trengthens our Opinion. Neither wou'd it prove, in the lea&s;t, Irreconcilable with what we have &s;aid, if the Ho|rizontal Moon &s;hou'd chance &s;ometimes to &s;eem enlarged beyond its u&s;ual Extent, even in more
<PB N="192" REF="198">
Screne Weather. For we mu&s;t not only have re|gard to the Mi&s;t, which happens to be in the place where we &s;tand; we ought al&s;o to take into our Thoughts, the whole Sum of Vapours and Exha|lations, which lie betwixt the Eye and the Moon: All which cooperating to render the Appearance of the Moon more Faint, and thereby increa&s;e its Magnitude, it may chance to appear greater than it u&s;ually does, even in the Horizontal Po&s;ition, at a time when, though there be no extraordinary Fog or Hazine&s;s, ju&s;t in the place where we &s;tand; yet, the Air between the Eye and the Moon, taken altogether, may be loaded with a greater quantity of inter&s;per&s;ed Vapours and Ex|halations, than at other times.</P>
<P N="72">LXXII. It may be objected, that in Con&s;e|quence of our Principles, the Interpo&s;ition of a Body in &s;ome degree Opaque, which may inter|cept a great Part of the Rays of Light, &s;hou'd ren|der the Appearance of the Moon in the Meridian as large, as when it is viewed in the Horizon. To which I an&s;wer, it is not Faintne&s;s any how appli|ed, that &s;ugge&s;ts greater Magnitude, there being no nece&s;&s;ary, but only an experimental Connexion between tho&s;e two things: It follows, that the Faintne&s;s, which enlarges the Appearance, mu&s;t be applied in &s;uch Sort, and with &s;uch Circum&s;tan|ces, as have been ob&s;erved to attend the Vi&s;ion of great Magnitudes. When from a Di&s;tance we be|hold great Objects, the Particles of the intermedi|ate Air and Vapours, which are them&s;elves unper|ceivable, do interrupt the Rays of Light, and thereby render the Appearance le&s;s &s;trong and vivid; now, Faintne&s;s of Appearance cau&s;ed in this Sort, hath been experienced to coexi&s;t with great Magnitude. But when it is cau&s;ed by the Interpo&s;ition of an opaque &s;en&s;ible Body, this Cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="193" REF="199">
alters the Ca&s;e, &s;o that a faint Appear|ance this way cau&s;ed, doth not &s;ugge&s;t greater Magnitude, becau&s;e it hath not been experienced to coexi&s;t with it.</P>
<P N="73">LXXIII. Faintne&s;s, as well as all other Ideas or Perceptions which &s;ugge&s;t Magnitude or Di&s;tance, doth it in the &s;ame way that Words &s;ugge&s;t the Notions to which they are annexed. Now it is known, a Word pronounced with certain Circum|&s;tances, or in a certain Context with other Words, hath not always the &s;ame Import and Signification that it hath when pronounced in &s;ome other Cir|cum&s;tances, or different Context of Words. The very &s;ame vi&s;ible Appearance as to Faintne&s;s and all other re&s;pects, if placed on high, &s;hall not &s;ug|ge&s;t the &s;ame Magnitude that it would if it were &s;een at an equal Di&s;tance, on a level with the Eye. The Rea&s;on whereof is, that we are rarely ac|cu&s;tomed to view Objects at a great Height; our Concerns lie among things &s;ituated rather before than above us; and accordingly our Eyes are not placed on the top of our Heads, but in &s;uch a Po|&s;ition, as is mo&s;t convenient for us to &s;ee di&s;tant Objects &s;tanding in our way, and this Situation of them being a Circum&s;tance, which u&s;ually attends the Vi&s;ion of di&s;tant Objects, we may from hence account for (what is commonly ob&s;erved) an Ob|ject's appearing of different Magnitude, even with re&s;pect to its Horizontal Exten&s;ion, on the top of a Steeple, for example, an hundred Feet high to one &s;tanding below, from what it would if placed at an hundred Feet di&s;tance on a level with his Eye. For it hath been &s;hewn, that the Judgment we make on the Magnitude of a thing, depends not on the vi&s;ible Appearance alone, but al&s;o on divers other Circum&s;tances, any one of which being omit|ted or varied may &s;uffice to make &s;ome alteration in
<PB N="194" REF="200">
our Judgment. Hence, the Circum&s;tance of view|ing a di&s;tant object in &s;uch a Situation as is u&s;ual, and &s;uits with the ordinary Po&s;ture of the Head and Eyes being omitted, and in&s;tead thereof a diffe|rent Situation of the Object, which requires a diffe|rent Po&s;ture of the Head taking place, it is not to be wondered at, if the Magnitude be judged diffe|rent; but it will be demanded, why an high Object &s;houl'd con&s;tantly appear le&s;s than an equidi&s;tant low Object of the &s;ame Dimen&s;ions, for &s;o it is ob|&s;erved to be; it may indeed be granted that the va|riation of &s;ome Circum&s;tances may vary the Judg|ment, made on the Magnitude of High Objects, which we are le&s;s u&s;ed to look at: But it does not hence appear, why they &s;hou'd be judged le&s;s rather than greater? I an&s;wer, that in ca&s;e the Magnitude of di&s;tant Objects was &s;ugge&s;ted by the Extent of their vi&s;ible Appearance alone, and thought Proportional thereto, it is certain they wou'd then be judged much le&s;s than now they &s;eem to be, <HI>Vide</HI> SECT. LXXIX. But &s;everal Circum&s;tances concurring to form the Judgment we make on the Magnitude of di&s;tant Objects, by means of which they appear far larger than others, who&s;e vi&s;ible Appearance hath an equal or even greater Exten&s;ion; it follows, that upon the Change or Omi&s;&s;ion of any of tho&s;e Circum&s;tances, which are wont to attend the Vi&s;ion of di&s;tant Ob|jects, and &s;o come to influence the Judgments made on their Magnitude, they &s;hall proportionably ap|pear le&s;s than otherwi&s;e they would. For any of tho&s;e things that cau&s;ed an Object to be thought greater, than in proportion to its vi&s;ible Exten&s;i|on, being either omitted or applied without the u&s;ual Circum&s;tances, the Judgment depends more intirely on the vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion, and con&s;equently the Object mu&s;t be judged le&s;s. Thus in the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e, the Situation of the thing &s;een being dif|ferent
<PB N="195" REF="201">
from what it u&s;ually is in tho&s;e Objects we have occa&s;ion to view, and who&s;e Magnitude we ob&s;erve, it follows, that the very &s;ame Object, be|ing an hundred Feet high, &s;hou'd &s;eem le&s;s than if it was an hundred Feet off on (or nearly on) a level with the Eye. What has been here &s;et forth, &s;eems to me to have no &s;mall &s;hare in contributing to magnify the Appearance of the horizontal Moon, and de&s;erves not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in the Explicati|on of it.</P>
<P N="74">LXXIV. If we attentively con&s;ider the Phaeno|menon before us, we &s;hall find the not di&s;cerning between the mediate and immediate Objects of Sight, to be the chief Cau&s;e of the Difficulty that occurs in the Explication of it. The Magnitude of the vi&s;ible Moon, or that which is the proper and immediate Object of Vi&s;ion, is no greater when the Moon is in the Horizon, than when it is in the Meridian. How comes it therefore, to &s;eem greater in one Situation than the other? What is it can put this Cheat on the Under&s;tanding? It has no other Perception of the Moon, than what it gets by Sight: And that which is &s;een, is of the &s;ame Extent, I &s;ay, the vi&s;ible Appearance hath the &s;ame, or rather a le&s;s Magnitude when the Moon is viewed in the Horizontal, than when in the Meri|dional Po&s;ition: And yet it is e&s;teemed greater in the former than in the latter. Herein con&s;i&s;ts the difficulty, which doth vani&s;h and admit of a mo&s;t ea&s;y Solution, if we con&s;ider that as the vi&s;ible Moon is not greater in the Horizon than in the Meridian, &s;o neither is it thought to be &s;o. It hath been already &s;hewn, that in any act of Vi&s;ion, the vi&s;ible Object ab&s;olutely, or in it &s;elf, is little taken notice of, the Mind &s;till carrying its View from that to &s;ome tangible Ideas, which have been ob&s;erved to be connected with it, and by that means come
<PB N="196" REF="202">
to be &s;ugge&s;ted by it. So that when a thing is &s;aid to appear great or &s;mall, or whatever E&s;timate be made of the Magnitude of any thing, this is meant not of the vi&s;ible, but of the tangible Object. This duly con&s;idered, it will be no hard matter to re|concile the &s;eeming Contradiction there is, that the Moon &s;hou'd appear of a different Bigne&s;s, the vi|&s;ible Magnitude thereof remaining &s;till the &s;ame. For by SECT. LVI. the very &s;ame vi&s;ible Exten|&s;ion, with a different Faintne&s;s, &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t a dif|ferent tangible Exten&s;ion. When therefore the Ho|rizontal Moon is &s;aid to appear greater than the Meridional Moon, this mu&s;t be under&s;tood not of a greater vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion, but of a greater tangible or real Exten&s;ion, which by rea&s;on of the more than ordinary Faintne&s;s of the vi&s;ible Appearance, is &s;ugge&s;ted to the Mind along with it.</P>
<P N="75">LXXV. Many Attempts have been made by Learned Men, to account for this Appearance. <HI>Ga&s;&s;endus, De&s;cartes, Hobbes,</HI> and &s;everal others, have emplowed their Thoughts on that Subject; but how fruitle&s;s and un&s;atisfactory their Endeavours have been, is &s;ufficiently &s;hewn in <HI>The Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil.

Since the Writing of which, there hath been publi&s;hed in the Tran&s;actions <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Num. 187. p. 323.</NOTE> another Paper relating to the &s;ame Affair, by the celebrated Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> wherein he attempts to ac|count for that Phaenomenon, which, though it &s;eems not to contain any thing new, or different from
<PB N="197" REF="203">
what had been &s;aid before by others, I &s;hall never|thele&s;s con&s;ider in this place.</P>
<P N="76">LXXVI. His Opinion, in &s;hort, is this; We judge not of the Magnitude of an Object by the vi&s;ual Angle alone, but by the vi&s;ual Angle in conjunction with the Di&s;tance. Hence, though the Angle remain the &s;ame, or even become le&s;s, yet if withal the Di&s;tance &s;eem to have been increa&s;ed, the Object &s;hall appear greater. Now, one way whereby we e&s;timate the Di&s;tance of any thing, is by the Number and Extent of the intermediate Objects: When therefore the Moon is &s;een in the Horizon, the Variety of Fields, Hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to|gether with the large Pro&s;pect of the wide extend|ed Land or Sea, that lies between the Eye and the utmo&s;t Limb of the Horizon, &s;ugge&s;t unto the Mind the Idea of greater Di&s;tance, and con&s;equent|ly magnify the Appearance. And this, according to Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> is the true Account of the ex|traordinary Largene&s;s attributed by the Mind to the Horizontal Moon, at a time when the Angle &s;ubtended by its Diameter, is not one jot greater than it u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P N="77">LXXVII. With reference to this Opinion, not to repeat what hath been already &s;aid concerning Di&s;tance, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That if the Pro&s;pect of interjacent Objects be that which &s;ug|ge&s;ts the Idea of farther Di&s;tance, and this Idea of farther Di&s;tance be the Cau&s;e that brings into the Mind the Idea of greater Magnitude, it &s;hou'd hence follow, that if one looked at the Horizontal Moon from behind a Wall, it would appear no bigger than ordinary. For in that Ca&s;e, the Wall interpo&s;ing cuts off all that Pro&s;pect of Sea and Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which might otherwi&s;e increa&s;e the ap|parent Di&s;tance, and thereby the apparent Magni|tude
<PB N="198" REF="204">
of the Moon. Nor will it &s;uffice to &s;ay, the Memory doth even then &s;ugge&s;t all that Extent of Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which lies within the Horizon; which Sugge&s;tion occa&s;ions a &s;udden Judgment of Sen&s;e, that the Moon is farther off and larger than u&s;ual. For ask any Man, who from &s;uch a Station behold|ing the Horizontal Moon, &s;hall think her greater than u&s;ual, whether he hath at that time in his Mind any Idea of the Intermediate Objects, or long Tract of Land that lies between his Eye and the extreme Edge of the Horizon? And whether it be that Idea which is the Cau&s;e of his making the aforementioned Judgment? He will, I &s;uppo&s;e, reply in the Negative, and declare the Horizontal Moon &s;hall appear greater than the Meridional, though he never thinks of all or any of tho&s;e things that lie between him and it. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible by this Hypothe&s;is, to account for the Moon's appearing in the very &s;ame Situation, at one time greater than at another; which neverthe|le&s;s has been &s;hewn to be very agreeable to the Principles we have laid down, and receives a mo&s;t ea&s;y and natural Explication from them. For the further clearing up of this Point, it is to be ob|&s;erved that what we immediately and properly &s;ee are only Lights and Colours in &s;undry Situations and Shades, and Degrees of Faintne&s;s and Clear|ne&s;s, Confu&s;ion and Di&s;tinctne&s;s. All which vi&s;i|ble Objects are only in the Mind; nor do they &s;ugge&s;t ought external, whether Di&s;tance or Mag|nitude, otherwi&s;e than by habitual Connexion as Words do Things. We are al&s;o to remark, that, be&s;ide the Straining of the Eyes, and be&s;ide the vivid and faint, the di&s;tinct and confu&s;ed Appear|ances (which bearing &s;ome Proportion to Lines and Angles, have been &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of them, in the foregoing Part of this Treati&s;e) there are other means which &s;ugge&s;t both Di&s;tance and Mag|nitude;
<PB N="199" REF="205">
particularly, the Situation of vi&s;ible Points, or Objects, as upper or lower; the former &s;ug|ge&s;ting a farther Di&s;tance and greater Magnitude, the latter a nearer Di&s;tance and le&s;&s;er Magnitude: All which is an Effect only of Cu&s;tom and Experi|ence; there being really nothing intermediate in the Line of Di&s;tance, between the Uppermo&s;t and Lowermo&s;t, which are both Aequidi&s;tant, or ra|ther at no Di&s;tance from the Eye, as there is al&s;o nothing in Upper or Lower, which by nece&s;&s;ary Connexion &s;hou'd &s;ugge&s;t greater or le&s;&s;er Magni|tude. Now, as the&s;e cu&s;tomary, experimental means of &s;ugge&s;ting Di&s;tance, do likewi&s;e &s;ugge&s;t Magnitude, &s;o they &s;ugge&s;t the one as immediately as the other. I &s;ay, they do not <HI>(Vide</HI> SECT. LIII.) fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;t Di&s;tance, and then leave the Mind from thence to infer or compute Magnitude, but &s;ugge&s;t Magnitude as immediately and directly as they &s;ugge&s;t Di&s;tance.</P>
<P N="78">LXXVIII. This Phaenomenon of the Horizon|tal Moon is a clear In&s;tance of the in&s;ufficiency of Lines and Angles, for explaining the way wherein the Mind perceives, and e&s;timates the Magnitude of outward Objects. There is neverthele&s;s a u&s;e of Computation by them, in order to determine the apparent Magnitude of things, &s;o far as they have a Connexion with, and are proportional to tho&s;e other Ideas, or Perceptions which are the true and immediate Occa&s;ions that &s;ugge&s;t to the Mind the apparent Magnitude of Things. But this in general may, I think, be ob&s;erved concern|ing Mathematical Computation in Optics: That it can never be very preci&s;e and exact, &s;ince the Judg|ments we make of the Magnitude of External Things do often depend on &s;everal Circum&s;tances, which are not proportionable to, or capable of be|ing defined by Lines and Angles.</P>
<P N="79"><PB N="200" REF="206">
LXXIX. From what has been &s;aid, we may &s;afely deduce this Con&s;equence, to wit, that a Man born blind, and made to &s;ee, wou'd, at fir&s;t opening of his Eyes make a very different Judg|ment of the Magnitude of Objects intromitted by them, from what others do. He wou'd not con|&s;ider the Ideas of Sight, with reference to, or as having any Connexion with the Ideas of Touch: His View of them being intirely terminated within them&s;elves, he can no otherwi&s;e judge them Great or Small, than as they contain a greater or le&s;&s;er Number of vi&s;ible Points. Now, it being certain that any vi&s;ible Point can cover or exclude from View, only one other vi&s;ible Point, it follows, that whatever Object intercepts the View of another, hath an equal Number of vi&s;ible Points with it; and con&s;equently they &s;hall both be thought by him to have the &s;ame Magnitude. Hence it is evi|dent, one in tho&s;e Circum&s;tances would judge his Thumb, with which he might hide a Tower, or hinder its being &s;een, equal to that Tower, or his Hand, the Interpo&s;ition whereof might conceal the Firmament from his View, equal to the Firma|ment: How great an Inequality &s;oever there may, in our Apprehen&s;ions, &s;eem to be betwixt tho&s;e two things, becau&s;e of the cu&s;tomary and clo&s;e Connexion that has grown up in our Minds be|tween the Objects of Sight and Touch, whereby the very different and di&s;tinct Ideas of tho&s;e two Sen&s;es, are &s;o blended and confounded together, as to be mi&s;taken for one and the &s;ame thing; out of which Prejudice we cannot ea&s;ily extricate our &s;elves.</P>
<P N="80">LXXX. For the better explaining the Nature of Vi&s;ion, and &s;etting the manner wherein we per|ceive Magnitudes in a due Light, I &s;hall proceed
<PB N="201" REF="207">
to make &s;ome Ob&s;ervations concerning Matters re|lating thereto, whereof the want of Reflexion, and duly &s;eparating between tangible and vi&s;ible Ideas, is apt to create in us mi&s;taken and confu&s;ed Notions. And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall ob&s;erve that the <HI>Minimum Vi&s;ibile</HI> is exactly equal in all Beings what|&s;oever, that are endowed with the vi&s;ive Faculty. No exqui&s;ite Formation of the Eye, no peculiar Sharpne&s;s of Sight can make it le&s;s in one Creature than in another; for it not being di&s;tingui&s;hable into Parts, nor in any wi&s;e con&s;i&s;ting of them, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the &s;ame to all. For &s;uppo&s;e it otherwi&s;e, and that the <HI>Minimum Vi&s;ibile</HI> of a Mite, for In&s;tance, be le&s;s than the <HI>Minimum Vi&s;i|bile</HI> of a Man; the latter therefore may by De|traction of &s;ome part be made equal to the former: It doth therefore con&s;i&s;t of Parts, which is incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Notion of a <HI>Minimum Vi&s;ibile,</HI> or Point.</P>
<P N="81">LXXXI. It will perhaps be objected that the <HI>Minimum Vi&s;ibile</HI> of a Man doth really, and in it &s;elf contain Parts whereby it &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of a Mite, though they are not perceivable by the Man. To which I an&s;wer, the <HI>Minimum Vi&s;ibile</HI> having (in like manner as all other the proper and imme|diate Objects of Sight) been &s;hewn not to have any Exi&s;tence without the Mind of him who &s;ees it, it follows there cannot be any part of it that is not actually perceived, and therefore vi&s;ible. Now for any Object to contain &s;everal di&s;tinct vi&s;i|ble Parts, and at the &s;ame time to be a <HI>Minimum Vi&s;ibile,</HI> is a manife&s;t Contradiction.</P>
<P N="82">LXXXII. Of the&s;e vi&s;ible Points we &s;ee at all times an equal Number. It is every whit as great when our View is contracted and bounded by near Objects, as when it is extended to larger and re|moter.
<PB N="202" REF="208">
For it being impo&s;&s;ible that one <HI>Minimum Vi&s;ibile</HI> &s;hould ob&s;cure, or keep out of Sight more than one other, it is a plain Con&s;equence, that when my View is on all &s;ides bounded by the Walls of my Study, I &s;ee ju&s;t as many vi&s;ible points as I cou'd, in ca&s;e that by the removal of the Study-walls, and all other Ob&s;tructions, I had a full Pro&s;|pect of the circumjacent Fields, Mountains, Sea, and open Firmament; for &s;o long as I am &s;hut up within the Walls, by their Interpo&s;ition, every Point of the external Objects is covered from my View: But each Point that is &s;een being able to cover or exclude from Sight, one only other cor|re&s;ponding Point, it follows, that whil&s;t my Sight is confined to tho&s;e narrow Walls, I &s;ee as many Points, or <HI>Minima Vi&s;ibilia,</HI> as I &s;hould were tho&s;e Walls away, by looking on all the external Ob|jects, who&s;e Pro&s;pect is intercepted by them. Whenever therefore we are &s;aid to have a greater Pro&s;pect at one time than another, this mu&s;t be un|der&s;tood with relation not to the proper and im|mediate, but the &s;econdary and mediate Objects of Vi&s;ion, which, as hath been &s;hewn, properly be|long to the Touch.</P>
<P N="83">LXXXIII. The vi&s;ive Faculty con&s;idered, with reference to its immediate Objects, may be found to labour of two Defects, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In re&s;pect of the Extent or Number of vi&s;ible Points that are at once perceivable by it, which is narrow and limit|ed to a certain Degree. It can take in at one View but a certain determinate Number of <HI>Mini|ma Vi&s;ibilia,</HI> beyond which it cannot extend its Pro&s;pect. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Our Sight is defective in that its View is not only narrow, but al&s;o for the mo&s;t part confu&s;ed; of tho&s;e things that we take in at one Pro&s;pect, we can &s;ee but a few at once clearly and unconfu&s;edly; and the more we fix our Sight
<PB N="203" REF="209">
on any one Object, by &s;o much the Darker and more Indi&s;tinct &s;hall the re&s;t appear.</P>
<P N="84">LXXXIV. Corre&s;ponding to the&s;e two Defects of Sight, we may imagine as many Perfections, to wit, <HI>1&s;t.</HI> That of comprehending in one View a greater Number of vi&s;ible Points. <HI>2dly.</HI> Of being able to view them all equally and at once, with the utmo&s;t Clearne&s;s and Di&s;tinction. That tho&s;e Perfections are not actually in &s;ome Intelligences of a different Order and Capacity from ours, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to know.</P>
<P N="85">LXXXV. In neither of tho&s;e two Ways do Mi|cro&s;copes contribute to the improvement of Sight; for when we look through a Micro&s;cope, we nei|ther &s;ee more vi&s;ible Points, nor are the collateral Points more di&s;tinct than when we look with the naked Eye, at Objects placed in a due Di&s;tance. A Micro&s;cope brings us as it were into a new World: It pre&s;ents us with a new Scene of vi&s;ible Objects, quite different from what we behold with the naked Eye. But herein con&s;i&s;ts the mo&s;t re|markable Difference, to wit, that whereas the Ob|jects perceived by the Eye alone, have a certain Connexion with tangible Objects, whereby we are taught to fore&s;ee what will en&s;ue upon the Ap|proach or Application of di&s;tant Objects to the Parts of our own Body, which much conduceth to its Pre&s;ervation; there is not the like Connex|ion between things tangible and tho&s;e vi&s;ible Ob|jects, that are perceived by help of a fine Micro|&s;cope.</P>
<P N="86">LXXXVI. Hence it is evident, that were our Eyes turned into the Nature of Micro&s;copes, we &s;hou'd not be much benefited by the Change; we &s;hou'd be deprived of the forementioned Advan|tage
<PB N="204" REF="210">
we at pre&s;ent receive by the vi&s;ive Faculty; and have left us only the empty Amu&s;ement of Seeing, without any other benefit ari&s;ing from it. But in that Ca&s;e, it will perhaps be &s;aid, our Sight wou'd be endued with a far greater Sharp|ne&s;s and Penetration than it now hath. But I wou'd fain know wherein con&s;i&s;ts that Sharpne&s;s, which is e&s;teemed &s;o great an Excellency of Sight. It is certain from what we have already &s;hewn, that the <HI>Minimum Vi&s;ibile</HI> is never greater or le&s;&s;er, but in all Ca&s;es con&s;tantly the &s;ame: And in the Ca&s;e of Micro&s;copical Eyes, I &s;ee only this Difference, to wit, that upon the cea&s;ing of a certain ob&s;erva|ble Connexion betwixt the divers Perceptions of Sight and Touch, which before enabled us to re|gulate our Actions by the Eye, it wou'd now be rendered utterly un&s;erviceable to that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="87">LXXXVII. Upon the whole, it &s;eems that if we con&s;ider the U&s;e and End of Sight, together with the pre&s;ent State and Circum&s;tances of our Being, we &s;hall not find any great Cau&s;e to com|plain of any Defect or Imperfection in it, or ea&s;ily conceive how it cou'd be mended. With &s;uch ad|mirable Wi&s;dom is that Faculty contrived, both for the Plea&s;ure and Convenience of Life.</P>
<P N="88">LXXXVIII. Having fini&s;hed what I intended to &s;ay, concerning the Di&s;tance and Magnitude of Objects, I come now to treat of the Manner, where|in the Mind perceives by Sight their Situation. Among the Di&s;coveries of the la&s;t Age, it is re|puted none of the lea&s;t, that the Manner of Vi&s;ion hath been more clearly explained, than ever it had been before. There is, at this Day, no one Igno|rant, that the Pictures of external Objects are painted on the <HI>Retina,</HI> or Fund of the Eye. That we can &s;ee nothing which is not &s;o painted: And
<PB N="205" REF="211">
that, according as the Picture is more Di&s;tinct or Confu&s;ed, &s;o al&s;o is the Perception we have of the Object: But then in this Explication of Vi&s;ion, there occurs one mighty Difficulty. The Objects are painted in an inverted Order on the Bottom of the Eye: The upper part of any Object being painted on the lower part of the Eye, and the lower part of the Object on the upper part of the Eye: And &s;o al&s;o as to Right and Left. Since therefore the Pictures are thus inverted, it is demanded how it comes to pa&s;s, that we &s;ee the Objects erect and in their natural Po&s;ture?</P>

In an&s;wer to this Difficulty, we are told, that the Mind perceiving an Impul&s;e of a Ray of Light, on the upper part of the Eye, con|&s;iders this Ray as coming in a direct Line, from the lower part of the Object; and in like manner tracing the Ray that &s;trikes on the lower part of the Eye, it is directed to the upper part of the Object. Thus in the adjacent Figure C the lower Point of the Object A B C is projected on <HI>c</HI> the upper part of the Eye. So likewi&s;e, the highe&s;t
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
Point A is projected on <HI>a</HI> the lowe&s;t part of the Eye, which makes the Repre&s;entation <HI>c b a</HI> in|verted: But the Mind con&s;idering the Stroke that is made on <HI>c</HI> as coming in the &s;traight Line C <HI>c</HI> from the lower end of the Object; and the Stroke or Impul&s;e on <HI>a,</HI> as coming in the Line
<PB N="206" REF="212">
A <HI>a</HI> from the upper End of the Object, is directed to make a right Judgment of the Situation of the Object A B C, notwith&s;tanding the Picture of it is inverted. This is illu&s;trated by conceiving a blind Man, who holding in his Hands two Sticks that cro&s;s each other, doth with them touch the extre|mities of an Object, placed in a perpendicular Si|tuation. It is certain, this Man will judge that to be the upper part of the Object, which he touches with the Stick held in the undermo&s;t Hand, and that to be the lower part of the Object, which he touches with the Stick in his uppermo&s;t Hand. This is the common Explication of the erect Ap|pearance of Objects, which is generally received and acquie&s;ced in, being (as Mr. <HI>Molyneux</HI> tells us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diopt. par. 2. c. 7. p. 289.</NOTE>) <HI>allowed by all Men as Satisfactory.</HI></P>
<P N="90">XC. But this account to me does not &s;eem in any degree True. Did I perceive tho&s;e Impul&s;es, Decu&s;&s;ations, and Directions of the Rays of Light, in like manner as hath been &s;et forth, then, indeed, it wou'd not at fir&s;t view be altogether void of Probability. And there might be &s;ome Pretence for the Compari&s;on of the Blind-Man and his cro&s;s Sticks. But the Ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e. I know very well that I perceive no &s;uch thing. And of Con&s;equence, I cannot thereby make an E&s;timate of the Situation of Objects. I appeal to any one's Experience, whether he be con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that he thinks on the Inter&s;ection made by the Ra|dious Pencils, or pur&s;ues the Impul&s;es they give in right Lines, whenever he perceives by Sight the Po&s;ition of any Object? To me it &s;eems evi|dent, that Cro&s;&s;ing and Tracing of the Rays, is never thought on by Children, Idiots, or in truth by any other, &s;ave only tho&s;e who have applyed
<PB N="207" REF="213">
them&s;elves to the Study of Optics. And for the Mind to judge of the Situation of Objects by tho&s;e things, without perceiving them, or to perceive them without knowing it, is equally beyond my Comprehen&s;ion. Add to this, that the explaining the manner of Vi&s;ion by the Example of cro&s;s Sticks, and hunting for the Object along the Axes of the Radious Pencils, doth &s;uppo&s;e the proper Objects of Sight to be perceived at a Di&s;tance from us, contrary to what hath been demon&s;trated.</P>
<P N="91">XCI. It remains, therefore, that we look for &s;ome other Explication of this Difficulty: And I believe it not impo&s;&s;ible to find one, provided we examine it to the Bottom, and carefully di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the Ideas of Sight and Touch; which cannot be too oft inculcated in treating of Vi&s;ion: But more e&s;pecially throughout the con&s;i|deration of this Affair, we ought to carry that Di&s;tinction in our Thoughts: For that from want of a right Under&s;tanding thereof, the Difficulty of explaining Erect Vi&s;ion &s;eems chiefly to ari&s;e.</P>
<P N="92">XCII. In order to di&s;entangle our Minds, from whatever Prejudices we may entertain with relation to the Subject in hand, nothing &s;eems more appo|&s;ite, than the taking into our Thoughts the Ca&s;e of one born Blind, and afterwards, when grown up, made to &s;ee. And though perhaps, it may not be an ea&s;y Task to dive&s;t our &s;elves intirely of the Experience received from Sight, &s;o as to be able to put our Thoughts exactly in the Po&s;ture of &s;uch a one's; we mu&s;t, neverthele&s;s as far as po&s;&s;ible, endeavour to frame true Conceptions, of what might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s in his Mind.</P>
<P N="93"><PB N="208" REF="214">
XCIII. It is certain, that a Man actually Blind, and who had continued &s;o from his Birth, wou'd by the &s;en&s;e of Feeling attain to have Ideas of Upper and Lower. By the Motion of his Hand he might di&s;cern the Situation of any Tangible Object placed within his Reach. That part on which he felt him&s;elf &s;upported, or towards which he perceived his Body to gravitate, he wou'd term Lower, and the contrary to this Upper; and ac|cordingly denominate what&s;oever Objects he touch|ed.</P>
<P N="94">XCIV. But then, whatever Judgments he makes concerning the Situation of Objects, are confined to tho&s;e only that are perceivable by Touch. All tho&s;e things that are Intangible, and of a &s;piritual Nature, his Thoughts and De&s;ires, his Pa&s;&s;ions, and in general all the Modifications of his Soul, to the&s;e he wou'd never apply the Terms Upper and Lower, except only in a Metaphorical Sen&s;e. He may, perhaps, by way of Allu&s;ion, &s;peak of high or low Thoughts: But tho&s;e Terms in their pro|per Signification, wou'd never be applyed to any thing, that was not conceived to exi&s;t without the Mind. For a Man born Blind, and remaining in the &s;ame State, could mean nothing el&s;e by the Words Higher and Lower, than a greater or le&s;&s;er Di&s;tance from the Earth: Which Di&s;tance he wou'd mea&s;ure by the Motion or Application of his Hand, or &s;ome other part of his Body. It is, therefore, evident, that all tho&s;e things which, in re&s;pect of each other, wou'd by him be thought Higher or Lower, mu&s;t be &s;uch as were conceived to exi&s;t without his Mind, in the ambient Space.</P>
<P N="95">XCV. Whence it plainly follows, that &s;uch a one, if we &s;uppo&s;e him made to &s;ee, wou'd not at
<PB N="209" REF="215">
fir&s;t Sight think, that any thing he &s;aw was High or Low, Erect or Inverted; for it hath been al|ready demon&s;trated in SECT. XLI. that he wou'd not think the Things he perceived by Sight to be at any Di&s;tance from him, or without his Mind. The Objects to which he had hitherto been u&s;ed to apply the Terms Up and Down, High and Low, were &s;uch only as affected, or were &s;ome way per|ceived by his Touch: But the proper Objects of Vi&s;ion make a new Set of Ideas, perfectly di&s;tinct and different from the former, and which can in no &s;ort make them&s;elves perceived by Touch. There is, therefore, nothing at all that cou'd induce him to think tho&s;e Terms applicable to them: Nor wou'd he ever think it, till &s;uch time as he had ob&s;erved their Connexion with Tangible Objects, and the &s;ame Prejudices began to in&s;inuate it &s;elf into his Under&s;tanding, which from their Infancy had grown up in the Under&s;tandings of other Men.</P>
<P N="96">XCVI. To &s;et this Matter in a clearer Light, I &s;hall make u&s;e of an Example. Suppo&s;e the above-mentioned blind Per&s;on, by his Touch, perceives a Man to &s;tand Erect. Let us inquire into the manner of this. By the application of his Hand to the &s;everal Parts of a Humane Body, he had perceived different Tangible Ideas, which being collected into &s;undry complex ones have di&s;tinct Names annexed to them. Thus one Combination of a certain Tangible Figure, Bulk, and Con&s;i&s;t|ency of Parts is called the Head, another the Hand, a Third the Foot, and &s;o of the re&s;t: All which Complex Ideas cou'd, in his Under&s;tanding, be made up only of Ideas perceivable by Touch. He had al&s;o by his Touch obtained an Idea of Earth or Ground, towards which he perceives the Parts of his Body to have a natural Tendency. Now, by Erect nothing more being meant, than
<PB N="210" REF="216">
that perpendicular Po&s;ition of a Man, wherein his Feet are neare&s;t to the Earth: If the blind Per&s;on by moving his Hand, over the Parts of the Man who &s;tands before him, perceives the tangible Ideas that compo&s;e the Head, to be farthe&s;t from, and tho&s;e that compo&s;e the Feet to be neare&s;t to, that other Combination of Tangible Ideas which he calls Earth: He will denominate that Man Erect. But if we &s;uppo&s;e him on a &s;udden to receive his Sight, and that he behold a Man &s;tanding before him, it is evident, in that Ca&s;e, he wou'd neither judge the Man he &s;ees to be Erect nor Inverted; for he never having known tho&s;e Terms applied to any other, &s;ave Tangible Things, or which exi&s;ted in the Space without him, and what he &s;ees neither being Tangible, nor perceived as exi&s;ting without, he cou'd not know that in propriety of Language they were applicable to it.</P>
<P N="97">XCVII. Afterwards, when upon turning his Head or Eyes up and down to the right and left, he &s;hall ob&s;erve the vi&s;ible Objects to change, and &s;hall al&s;o attain to know, that they are called by the &s;ame Names, and connected with the Objects perceived by Touch; then, indeed, he will come to &s;peak of them and their Situation, in the &s;ame Terms that he has been u&s;ed to apply to Tangible Things: And tho&s;e that he perceives by turning up his Eyes, he will call Upper, and tho&s;e that by turning down his Eyes, he will call Lower.</P>
<P N="98">XCVIII. And this &s;eems to me the true Rea|&s;on why he &s;hou'd think tho&s;e Objects uppermo&s;t that are painted on the Lower part of his Eye: For, by turning the Eye up they &s;hall be di&s;tinct|ly &s;een; as likewi&s;e tho&s;e that are painted on the highe&s;t part of the Eye &s;hall be di&s;tinctly &s;een, by turning the Eye down, and are for that Rea&s;on
<PB N="211" REF="217">
e&s;teemed lowe&s;t: For we have &s;hewn that to the immediate Objects of Sight, con&s;idered in them|&s;elves, he wou'd not attribute the Terms High and Low. It mu&s;t therefore be on account of &s;ome Circum&s;tances, which are ob&s;erved to attend them: And the&s;e, it is plain, are the Actions of turning the Eye up and down, which &s;ugge&s;t a very obvi|ous Rea&s;on, why the Mind &s;hou'd denominate the Objects of Sight accordingly High or Low. And without this Motion of the Eye, this turning it up and down in order to di&s;cern different Objects, doubtle&s;s Erect, Inver&s;e, and other the like Terms relating to the Po&s;ition of Tangible Objects, wou'd never have been transferred, or in any degree ap|prehended to belong to the Ideas of Sight: The meer Act of Seeing including nothing in it to that Purpo&s;e; whereas the different Situations of the Eye naturally direct the Mind to make a &s;uitable Judgment of the Situation of Objects intromitted by it.</P>
<P N="99">XCIX. Farther, when he has by Experience learned the Connexion there is between the &s;everal Ideas of Sight and Touch, he will be able, by the Perception he has of the Situation of Vi&s;ible Things in re&s;pect of one another, to make a &s;udden and true E&s;timate of the Situation of Outward, Tan|gible Things corre&s;ponding to them. And thus it is, he &s;hall perceive by Sight the Situation of Ex|ternal Objects, which do not properly fall under that Sen&s;e.</P>
<P N="100">C. I know we are very prone to think, that if ju&s;t made to &s;ee, we &s;hou'd judge of the Situation of Vi&s;ible Things as we do now: But, we are al&s;o as prone to think, that at fir&s;t Sight, we &s;hou'd in the &s;ame way apprehend the Di&s;tance and Magnitude of Objects, as we do now: Which hath been &s;hewn
<PB N="212" REF="218">
to be a fal&s;e and groundle&s;s Per&s;ua&s;ion. And for the like Rea&s;ons, the &s;ame Cen&s;ure may be pa&s;t on the po&s;itive A&s;&s;urance, that mo&s;t Men, before they have thought &s;ufficiently of the Matter, might have of their being able to determine by the Eye at fir&s;t view, whether Objects were Erect or Inver&s;e.</P>
<P N="101">CI. It will, perhaps be objected to our Opini|on, that a Man, for In&s;tance, being thought Erect when his Feet are next the Earth, and Inverted when his Head is next the Earth, it doth hence follow, that by the meer act of Vi&s;ion, without a|ny Experience or altering the Situation of the Eye, we &s;hou'd have determined whether he were Erect or Inverted: For both the Earth it &s;elf, and the Limbs of the Man who &s;tands thereon, being e|qually perceived by Sight, one cannot choo&s;e &s;ee|ing, what part of the Man is neare&s;t the Earth, and what part farthe&s;t from it, <HI>i. e.</HI> whether he be Erect or Inverted.</P>
<P N="102">CII. To which I an&s;wer, the Ideas which con|&s;titute the Tangible Earth and Man, are intirely different from tho&s;e which con&s;titute the Vi&s;ible Earth and Man. Nor was it po&s;&s;ible, by virtue of the Vi&s;ive Faculty alone, without &s;uperadding any Experience of Touch, or altering the Po&s;ition of the Eye, ever to have known, or &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected, there had been any Relation or Connex|ion between them: Hence, a Man at fir&s;t view wou'd not denominate any thing he &s;aw Earth, or Head, or Foot; and con&s;equently, he cou'd not tell by the meer act of Vi&s;ion, whether the Head or Feet were neare&s;t the Earth: Nor, in|deed, wou'd we have thereby any thought of Earth or Man, Erect or Inver&s;e, at all: Which will be made yet more evident, if we nicely ob&s;erve, and
<PB N="213" REF="219">
make a particular Compari&s;on between the Ideas of both Sen&s;es.</P>
<P N="103">CIII. That which I &s;ee is only variety of Light and Colours. That which I feel is Hard or Soft, Hot or Cold, Rough or Smooth. What Simili|tude, what Connexion have tho&s;e Ideas with the&s;e? Or how is it po&s;&s;ible, that any one &s;hou'd &s;ee Rea|&s;on, to give one and the &s;ame Name to Combinati|ons of Ideas &s;o very different, before he had expe|rienced their Coexi&s;tence? We do not find there is any nece&s;&s;ary Connexion betwixt this or that Tan|gible Quality, and any Colour what&s;oever. And we may &s;ometimes perceive Colours, where there is nothing to be felt. All which doth make it ma|nife&s;t, that no Man at fir&s;t receiving of his Sight, wou'd know there was any Agreement between this or that particular Object of his Sight, and any Object of Touch he had been already acquainted with: The Colours therefore of the Head, wou'd to him no more &s;ugge&s;t the Idea of Head, than they wou'd the Idea of Foot.</P>
<P N="104">CIV. Farther, we have at large &s;hewn (vid. SECT. LXIII and LXIV.) there is no dicoverable, nece&s;|&s;ary Connexion, between any given Vi&s;ible Magni|tude, and any one particular Tangible Magnitude; but that it is intirely the re&s;ult of Cu&s;tom and Ex|perience, and depends on foreign and accidental Circum&s;tances, that we can by the Perception of Vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion inform our &s;elves, what may be the Exten&s;ion of any Tangible Object connected with it. Hence it is certain that neither the Vi&s;i|ble Magnitude of Head or Foot, wou'd bring a|long with them into the Mind, at fir&s;t opening of the Eyes, the re&s;pective Tangible Magnitudes of tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P N="105"><PB N="214" REF="220">
CV. By the foregoing Section, it is plain the Vi&s;ible Figure of any Part of the Body hath no ne|ce&s;&s;ary Connexion with the Tangible Figure there|of, &s;o as at Fir&s;t Sight to &s;ugge&s;t it to the Mind: For Figure is the Termination of Magnitude, whence it follows, that no Vi&s;ible Magnitude, hav|ing in its own Nature an aptne&s;s to &s;ugge&s;t any one particular Tangible Magnitude, &s;o neither can any Vi&s;ible Figure be in&s;eparably connected with its corre&s;ponding Tangible Figure: So as of it &s;elf and in a way prior to Experience, it might &s;ug|ge&s;t it to the Under&s;tanding. This will be farther evident, if we con&s;ider that what &s;eems &s;mooth and round to the Touch, may to Sight, if viewed through a Micro&s;cope, &s;eem quite otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="106">CVI. From all which laid together and duly con&s;idered, we may clearly deduce this Inference. In the fir&s;t act of Vi&s;ion, no Idea entering by the Eye, wou'd have a perceivable Connexion with the Ideas to which the Names Earth, Man, Head, Foot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were annexed in the Under&s;tanding of a Per&s;on Blind from his Birth; &s;o as in any &s;ort to introduce them into his Mind, or make them&s;elves be called by the &s;ame Names, and reputed the &s;ame Things with them, as afterwards they come to be.</P>
<P N="107">CVII. There doth, neverthele&s;s, remain one Difficulty, which perhaps may &s;eem to pre&s;s hard on our Opinion, and de&s;erve not to be pa&s;&s;ed over: For though it be granted that neither the Colour, Size, nor Figure of the vi&s;ible Feet have any ne|ce&s;&s;ary Connexion with the Ideas that compo&s;e the Tangible Feet, &s;o as to bring them at fir&s;t &s;ight in|to my Mind, or make me in danger of confounding them before I had been u&s;ed to, and for &s;ome time experienced their Connexion: Yet thus much &s;eems
<PB N="215" REF="221">
undeniable, namely, that the Number of the vi&s;i|ble Feet, being the &s;ame with that of the Tangible Feet, I may from hence without any Experience of Sight, rea&s;onably conclude, that they repre&s;ent or are connected with the Feet rather than the Head. I &s;ay, it &s;eems the Idea of two vi&s;ible Feet will &s;ooner &s;ugge&s;t to the Mind, the Idea of two tangible Feet than of one Head; &s;o that the blind Man upon fir&s;t Reception of the vi&s;ive Faculty might know, which were the Feet or Two, and which the Head or One.</P>
<P N="108">CVIII. In order to get clear of this &s;eeming Difficulty, we need only ob&s;erve, that Diver&s;ity of vi&s;ible Objects doth not nece&s;&s;arily infer diver&s;i|ty of tangible Objects corre&s;ponding to them. A Picture painted with great variety of Colours af|fects the Touch in one uniform manner; it is there|fore evident, that I do not by any nece&s;&s;ary Con|&s;ecution, independent of Experience, judge of the number of things Tangible, from the Number of things Vi&s;ible. I &s;hou'd not therefore at fir&s;t open|ing my Eyes conclude, that becau&s;e I &s;ee two I &s;hall feel two. How, therefore can I, before Ex|perience teaches me, know that the vi&s;ible Legs, becau&s;e two, are connected with the tangible Legs, or the vi&s;ible Head, becau&s;e one is connected with the tangible Head? The truth is, the things I &s;ee are &s;o very different and heterogeneous from the things I feel, that the Perception of the one wou'd never have &s;ugge&s;ted the other to my thoughts, or enabled me to pa&s;s the lea&s;t Judgment thereon, un|til I had experienced their Connexion.</P>
<P N="109">CIX. But for a fuller Illu&s;tration of this Matter, it ought to be con&s;idered that Number (however &s;ome may reckon it among&s;t the Primary Qualities) is nothing fixed and &s;ettled, really exi&s;ting in things
<PB N="216" REF="222">
them&s;elves. It is intirely the Creature of the Mind, con&s;idering, either an Idea by it &s;elf, or any Com|bination of Ideas to which it gives one Name, and &s;o makes it pa&s;s for an Unite. According as the Mind variou&s;ly combines its Ideas, the Unite varies; and as the Unite, &s;o the Number, which is only a Collection of Unites, doth al&s;o vary. We call a Window one, a Chimney one, and yet a Hou&s;e in which there are many Windows, and many Chim|neys, hath an equal right to be called one, and ma|ny Hou&s;es go to the making of one City. In the&s;e and the like In&s;tances, it is evident the <HI>Unite</HI> con|&s;tantly relates to the particular Draughts the Mind makes of its Ideas, to which it affixes Names, and wherein it includes more or le&s;s, as be&s;t &s;uits its own Ends and Purpo&s;es. Whatever therefore the Mind con&s;iders as one, that is an Unite. Every Combination of Ideas is con&s;idered as one thing by the Mind, and in token thereof is marked by one Name. Now, this Naming and Combining to|gether of Ideas is perfectly arbitrary, and done by the Mind in &s;uch &s;ort, as Experience &s;hews it to be mo&s;t convenient: Without which, our Ideas had never been collected into &s;uch &s;undry di&s;tinct Combinations as they now are.</P>
<P N="110">CX. Hence it follows, that a Man born Blind, and afterwards, when grown up, made to &s;ee, wou'd not in the fir&s;t act of Vi&s;ion, parcel out the Ideas of Sight, into the &s;ame di&s;tinct Collections that o|thers do, who have experienced which do regular|ly coexi&s;t and are proper to be bundled up toge|ther under one Name. He wou'd not, for Exam|ple, make into one complex Idea, and thereby e&s;teem, and unite all tho&s;e particular Ideas, which con&s;titute the vi&s;ible Head or Foot. For there can be no Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned why he &s;hou'd do &s;o, barely upon his &s;eeing a Man &s;tand upright before him:
<PB N="217" REF="223">
There croud into his Mind the Ideas which com|po&s;e the vi&s;ible Man, in company with all the o|ther Ideas of Sight perceiv'd at the &s;ame time: But all the&s;e Ideas offer'd at once to his View, he wou'd not di&s;tribute into &s;undry di&s;tinct Combinations, till &s;uch as by ob&s;erving the Motion of the Parts of the Man and other Experiences, he comes to know, which are to be &s;eparated, and which to be collected together.</P>
<P N="111">CXI. From what hath been premi&s;ed, it is plain the Objects of Sight and Touch make, if I may &s;o &s;ay, two Sets of Ideas, which are widely different from each other. To Objects of either kind, we indifferently attribute the Terms high and low, right and left, and &s;uch like, denoting the Po&s;ition or Situation of things: But then we mu&s;t well ob|&s;erve that the Po&s;ition of any Object is determined with re&s;pect only to Objects of the &s;ame Sen&s;e. We &s;ay any Object of Touch is high or low; ac|cording as it is more or le&s;s di&s;tant from the tangi|ble Earth: And in like manner we denominate any Object of Sight high or low, in Proportion as it is more or le&s;s di&s;tant from the vi&s;ible Earth: But to define the Situation of vi&s;ible Things, with re|lation to the Di&s;tance they bear from any tangible Thing, or <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> this were ab&s;urd and perfect|ly untintelligible. For all vi&s;ible things are equal|ly in the Mind, and take up no part of the exter|nal Space: And con&s;equently are equidi&s;tant from any tangible thing, which exi&s;ts without the Mind.</P>
<P N="112">CXII. Or rather to &s;peak truly, the proper Ob|jects of Sight are at no Di&s;tance, neither near nor far from any tangible Thing. For if we in|quire narrowly into the Matter we &s;hall find that tho&s;e things only are compared together in re&s;pect of Di&s;tance, which exi&s;t after the &s;ame manner, or
<PB N="218" REF="224">
appertain unto the &s;ame Sen&s;e. For by the Di|&s;tance between any two Points, nothing more is meant than the Number of intermediate Points: If the given Points are vi&s;ible, the Di&s;tance between them is marked out by the Number of the interja|cent vi&s;ible Points: If they are tangible, the Di|&s;tance between them is a Line con&s;i&s;ting of tangi|ble Points; but if they are one Tangible, and the other Vi&s;ible, the Di&s;tance between them doth nei|ther con&s;i&s;t of Points perceivable by Sight nor by Touch, <HI>i. e.</HI> it is utterly inconceivable. This, per|haps, will not find an ea&s;y Admi&s;&s;ion into all Mens Under&s;tanding: However, I &s;hould gladly be in|formed whether it be not true, by any one who will be at the pains to reflect a little, and apply it home to his Thoughts.</P>
<P N="113">CXIII. The not ob&s;erving what has been deli|vered in the two la&s;t Sections, &s;eems to have occa|&s;ioned no &s;mall part of the Difficulty that occurs in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Erect Appearances. The Head, which is painted neare&s;t the Earth, &s;eems to be farthe&s;t from it; and on the other hand, the Feet, which are painted farthe&s;t from the Earth, are thought neare&s;t to it. Herein lies the Difficulty, which vani&s;hes if we expre&s;s the thing more clear|ly and free from Ambiguity, thus: How comes it that, to the Eye, the vi&s;ible Head which is near|e&s;t the tangible Earth, &s;eems farthe&s;t from the Earth, and the vi&s;ible Feet, which are farthe&s;t from the tangible Earth, &s;eem neare&s;t the Earth? The Que&s;tion being thus propo&s;ed, who &s;ees not the Difficulty is founded on a Suppo&s;ition, that the Eye, or vi&s;ive Faculty, or rather the Soul by means thereof, &s;hou'd judge of the Situation of vi|&s;ible Objects, with reference to their Di&s;tance from the tangible Earth? Whereas it is evident the tan|gible Earth is not perceived by Sight: And it hath

been &s;hewn in the two la&s;t preceding Sections, that the Location of Vi&s;ible Objects is determined only by the Di&s;tance they bear from one another; and that it is Non&s;en&s;e to talk of Di&s;tance, far or near, between a vi&s;ible and tangible Thing.</P>
<P N="114">CXIV. If we confine our Thoughts to the proper Objects of Sight, the whole is plain and ea&s;y. The Head is painted farthe&s;t from, and the Feet near|e&s;t to the vi&s;ible Earth; and &s;o they appear to be. What is there &s;trange or unaccountable in this? Let us &s;uppo&s;e the Pictures in the Fund of the Eye, to be the immediate Objects of the Sight. The Con&s;equence is, that things &s;hou'd appear in the &s;ame Po&s;ture they are painted in; and is it not &s;o? The Head which is &s;een, &s;eems farthe&s;t from the Earth which is &s;een; and the Feet, which are &s;een, &s;eem neare&s;t to the Earth which is &s;een; and ju&s;t &s;o they are painted.</P>
<P N="115">CXV. But, &s;ay you, the Picture of the Man is inverted, and yet the Appearance is Erect: I ask, what mean you by the Picture of the Man, or, which is the &s;ame thing, the vi&s;ible Man's being inverted? You tell me it is inverted, becau&s;e the Heels are uppermo&s;t, and the Head undermo&s;t? Explain me this. You &s;ay, that by the Head's being under|mo&s;t, you mean that it is neare&s;t to the Earth; and by the Heels being uppermo&s;t, that they are farthe&s;t from the Earth. I ask again, what Earth you mean? You cannot mean the Earth that is painted on the Eye, or the vi&s;ible Earth: For the Picture of the Head is farthe&s;t from the Picture of the Earth, and the Picture of the Feet neare&s;t to the Picture of the Earth; and accordingly the vi&s;ible Head is farthe&s;t from the vi&s;ible Earth, and the vi&s;ible Feet neare&s;t to it. It remains, therefore, that you mean the tangible Earth, and &s;o determine the Situation of vi&s;ible things with re&s;pect to tangible Things; contrary to what
<PB N="220" REF="226">
hath been demon&s;trated in SECT. CXI. and CXII. The two di&s;tinct Provinces of Sight and Touch &s;hou'd be con&s;idered apart, and as if their Objects had no Intercour&s;e, no manner of Relation to one another, in point of Di&s;tance or Po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="116">CXVI. Farther, what greatly contributes to make us mi&s;take in this Matter is, that when we think of the Pictures in the Fund of the Eye, we imagine our &s;elves looking on the Fund of another's Eye, or another looking on the Fund of our own Eye, and beholding the Pictures painted thereon. Suppo&s;e two Eyes A and B: A from &s;ome di&s;tance looking on the Pictures in B &s;ees them inverted, and for that rea&s;on concludes they are inverted in B: But this is wrong. There are projected in little on the Bottom of A, the Images of the Pictures of, &s;uppo&s;e Man, Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are painted on B. And be&s;ides the&s;e, the Eye B it &s;elf, and the Ob|jects which environ it, together with another Earth, are projected in a larger Size on A. Now, by the Eye A, the&s;e larger Images are deemed the true Objects, and the le&s;&s;er only Pictures in miniature. And it is with re&s;pect to tho&s;e greater Images, that it determines the Situation of the &s;maller Ima|ges: So that comparing the little Man with the great Earth, A judges him inverted, or that the Feet are farthe&s;t from, and the Head neare&s;t to the great Earth. Whereas, if A compare the lit|tle Man with the little Earth, then he will appear Erect, <HI>i. e.</HI> his Head &s;hall &s;eem farthe&s;t from, and his Feet neare&s;t to the little Earth. But we mu&s;t con&s;ider that B does not &s;ee two Earths as A does: It &s;ees only what is repre&s;ented by the little Pic|tures in A, and con&s;equently &s;hall judge the Man Erect: For, in truth, the Man in B is not invert|ed, for there the Feet are next the Earth; but it is the Repre&s;entation of it in A which is inverted,
<PB N="221" REF="227">
for there the Head of the Repre&s;entation of the Picture of the Man in B is next the Earth, and the Feet farthe&s;t from the Earth, meaning the Earth which is without the Repre&s;entation of the Pictures in B. For if you take the little Images of the Pic|tures in B, and con&s;ider them by them&s;elves, and with re&s;pect only to one another, they are all Erect and in their natural Po&s;ture.</P>
<P N="117">CXVII. Farther, there lies a Mi&s;take in our i|magining that the Pictures of external Objects are painted on the Bottom of the Eye. It hath been &s;hewn, there is no re&s;emblance between the Ideas of Sight, and things Tangible. It hath likewi&s;e been demon&s;trated, that the proper Objects of Sight do not exi&s;t without the Mind. Whence it clearly follows, that the Pictures painted on the Bottom of the Eye, are not the Pictures of external Objects. Let any one con&s;ult his own Thoughts, and then &s;ay what Affinity, what Likene&s;s there is between that certain Variety and Di&s;po&s;ition of Colours, which con&s;titute the vi&s;ible Man, or Picture of a Man, and that other Combination of far different Ideas, &s;en&s;ible by Touch, which compo&s;e the tangible Man. But if this be the Ca&s;e, how come they to be accounted Pictures or Images, &s;ince that &s;up|po&s;es them to copy or repre&s;ent &s;ome Originals or other?</P>
<P N="118">CXVIII. To which I an&s;wer: In the foremen|tioned In&s;tance, the Eye A takes the little Images, included within the Repre&s;entation of the other Eye B, to be Pictures or Copies, whereof the Ar|chetypes are not things exi&s;ting without, but the larger Pictures projected on its own Fund: and which by A are not thought Pictures, but the O|riginals, or true Things them&s;elves. Though if we &s;uppo&s;e a third Eye C, from a due Di&s;tance to
<PB N="222" REF="228">
behold the Fund of A, then indeed the Things projected thereon, &s;hall, to C, &s;eem Pictures or Images, in the &s;ame Sen&s;e that tho&s;e projected on B do to A.</P>
<P N="119">CXIX. Rightly to conceive this Point, we mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between the Ideas of Sight and Touch, between the vi&s;ible and tangible Eye; for certainly on the tangible Eye, nothing either is or &s;eems to be painted. Again, the vi&s;ible Eye, as well as all other vi&s;ible Objects, hath been &s;hewn to exi&s;t only in the Mind, which perceiving its own Ideas, and comparing them together, calls &s;ome <HI>Pictures</HI> in re&s;pect of others. What hath been &s;aid, being rightly comprehended and laid together, doth, I think, afford a full and genuine Explication of the erect Appearance of Objects; which Phaenomenon, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I do not &s;ee how it can be explain|ed by any Theories of Vi&s;ion hitherto made pub|lick.</P>
<P N="120">CXX. In treating of the&s;e things, the u&s;e of Language is apt to occa&s;ion &s;ome Ob&s;curity and Confu&s;ion, and create in us wrong Ideas: For Language being accommodated to the Common Notions and Prejudices of Men, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;i|ble to deliver the naked and preci&s;e Truth, with|out great Circumlocution, Impropriety, and (to an unwary Reader) &s;eeming Contradictions; I do, therefore, once for all de&s;ire whoever &s;hall think it worth his while to under&s;tand what I have written concerning Vi&s;ion, that he would not &s;tick in this or that Phra&s;e, or manner of Expre&s;&s;ion, but can|didly collect my Meaning from the whole Sum and Tenor of my Di&s;cour&s;e, and laying a&s;ide the Words as much as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;ider the bare Notions them&s;elves, and then judge whether they are agree|able to Truth and his own Experience, or no.</P>
<P N="121"><PB N="223" REF="229">
CXXI. We have &s;hewn the way wherein the Mind by mediation of vi&s;ible Ideas doth perceive or apprehend the Di&s;tance, Magnitude, and Situ|ation of tangible Objects. I come now to inquire more particularly concerning the Difference be|tween the Ideas of Sight and Touch, which are call'd by the &s;ame Names, and &s;ee whether there be any Idea common to both Sen&s;es. From what we have at large &s;et forth and demon&s;trated in the fore|going parts of this Treati&s;e, it is plain there is no one &s;elf &s;ame numerical Exten&s;ion, perceived both by Sight and Touch; but that the particular Fi|gures and Exten&s;ions perceived by Sight, however they may be called by the &s;ame Names, and reput|ed the &s;ame Things, with tho&s;e perceived by Touch, are neverthele&s;s different, and have an Ex|i&s;tence di&s;tinct and &s;eparate from them: So that the Que&s;tion is not now concerning the &s;ame nume|rical Ideas, but whether there be any one and the &s;ame &s;ort or Species of Ideas equally perceiveable to both Sen&s;es? Or, in other Words, whether Ex|ten&s;ion, Figure, and Motion perceived by Sight, are not &s;pecifically di&s;tinct from Exten&s;ion, Figure and Motion perceived by Touch?</P>
<P N="122">CXXII. But before I come more particularly to di&s;cu&s;s this Matter, I find it proper to con&s;ider Exten&s;ion in Ab&s;tract: For of this there is much talk, and I apt to think, that when Men &s;peak of Exten|&s;ion, as being an Idea common to Two Sen&s;es, it is with a &s;ecret Suppo&s;ition, that we can &s;ingle out Exten&s;ion from all other tangible and vi&s;ible Qua|lities, and form thereof an Ab&s;tract Idea, which Idea they will have common both to Sight and Touch. We are therefore to under&s;tand by Ex|ten&s;ion in Ab&s;tract, an Idea of Exten&s;ion; for in|&s;tance, a Line or Surface, intirely &s;tript of all o|ther
<PB N="224" REF="230">
&s;en&s;ible Qualities and Circum&s;tances that might determine it to any particular Exi&s;tence; it is nei|ther black nor white, nor red, nor hath it any Co|lour at all, or any tangible Quality what&s;oever, and con&s;equently it is of no finite determinate Magni|tude: For that which bounds or di&s;tingui&s;hes one Exten&s;ion from another, is &s;ome Quality or Cir|cum&s;tance wherein they di&s;agree.</P>
<P N="123">CXXIII. Now I do not find that I can perceive, imagine, or any wi&s;e frame in my Mind &s;uch an ab|&s;tract Idea, as is here &s;poken of. A Line or Sur|face, which is neither black, nor white, nor blue, nor yellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor long, nor &s;hort, nor rough, nor &s;mooth, nor &s;quare, nor round, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is per|fectly incomprehen&s;ible. This I am &s;ure of as to my &s;elf; how far the Faculties of other Men may reach, they be&s;t can tell.</P>
<P N="124">CXXIV. It is commonly &s;aid, that the Object of Geometry is ab&s;tract Exten&s;ion; but Geometry contemplates Figures: Now, Figure is the Ter|mination of Magnitude, but we have &s;hewn that Exten&s;ion in Ab&s;tract hath no finite determinate Magnitude, whence it clearly follows that it can have no Figure, and con&s;equently is not the Object of Geometry. It is indeed a Tenet as well of the modern as of the ancient Philo&s;ophers, that all ge|neral Truths are concerning univer&s;al ab&s;tract Ideas; without which, we are told, there cou'd be no Science, no Demon&s;tration of any general Propo&s;i|tion in Geometry. But it were no hard matter, did I think it nece&s;&s;ary to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, to &s;hew that Propo&s;itions and Demon&s;trations in Geometry might be Univer&s;al, though they who make them, never think of ab&s;tract general Ideas of Triangles or Circles.</P>
<P N="125"><PB N="225" REF="231" MS="y">
CXXV. After reiterated endeavours to appre|hend the general Idea of a Triangle, I have found it altogether incomprehen&s;ible.

That a Man who thought &s;o much, and laid &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s on clear and de|terminate Ideas, &s;hou'd neverthele&s;s talk at this rate, &s;eems very &s;urpri&s;ing. But the wonder will

<P N="126">CXXVI. &s;ome, perhaps, may think pure Space, <HI>Vacuum,</HI> or Trine Dimen&s;ion to be equally the Object of Sight and Touch: But though we have a very great Propen&s;ion, to think the Ideas of Outne&s;s and Space to be the immediate Ob|ject of Sight; yet if I mi&s;take not, in the forego|ing Parts of this E&s;&s;ay, That hath been clearly demon&s;trated to be a meer Delu&s;ion, ari&s;ing from the quick and &s;udden &s;ugge&s;tion of Fancy, which &s;o clo&s;ely connects the Idea of Di&s;tance with tho&s;e of Sight, that we are apt to think it is it &s;elf a proper and immediate Object of that Sen&s;e, till Rea&s;on corrects the Mi&s;take.</P>
<P N="127">CXXVII. It having been shewn, that there are no Ab&s;tract Ideas of Figure, and that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for us, by any Preci&s;ion of Thought, to frame an Idea of Exten&s;ion &s;eparate from all other Vi&s;i|ble and Tangible Qualities, which &s;hall be com|mon both to Sight and Touch: The Que&s;tion now remaining is, whether the particular Exten&s;ions, Figures and Motions perceived by Sight be of the &s;ame kind, with the particular Exten&s;ions, Figures, and Motions perceived by Touch? In an&s;wer to which, I &s;hall venture to lay down the following Propo&s;ition: <HI>The Exten&s;ion, Figures, and Motions, perceived by Sight are &s;pecifically di&s;tinct from the Ide|as of Touch, called by the &s;ame Names, nor is there any &s;uch thing as one Idea, or kind of Idea common to</HI>
<PB N="227" REF="233">
<HI>both Sen&s;es.</HI> This Propo&s;ition may, without much Difficulty, be collected from what hath been &s;aid in &s;everal Places of this E&s;&s;ay. But, becau&s;e it &s;eems &s;o remote from, and contrary to, the receiv|ed Notions and &s;ettled Opinion of Mankind, I &s;hall attempt to demon&s;trate it more particularly, and at large, by the following Arguments.</P>
<P N="128">CXXVIII. When upon Perception of an Idea, I range it under this or that &s;ort; it is becau&s;e it is perceived after the &s;ame manner, or becau&s;e it has a Likene&s;s or Conformity with, or affects me in the &s;ame way as the Ideas of the &s;ort I rank it under. In &s;hort, it mu&s;t not be intirely new, but have &s;omething in it Old, and already perceived by me: It mu&s;t, I &s;ay, have &s;o much, at lea&s;t, in common with the Ideas I have before known and named, as to make me give it the &s;ame Name with them. But it has been, if I mi&s;take not, clearly made out, that a Man born Blind wou'd not at fir&s;t reception of his Sight, think the Things he &s;aw were of the &s;ame Nature with the Objects of Touch, or had any thing in common with them; but that they were a new Set of Ideas, perceived in a new manner, and intirely different from all he had ever perceived before: So that he wou'd not call them by the &s;ame Name, nor repute them to be of the &s;ame Sort, with any thing he had hitherto known.</P>
<P N="129">CXXIX. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Light and Colours are al|lowed by all to con&s;titute a &s;ort or Species intirely different from the Ideas of Touch: Nor will any Man, I pre&s;ume, &s;ay they can make them&s;elves perceived by that Sen&s;e: But there is no other immediate Object of Sight, be&s;ides Light and Co|lours. It is therefore a direct Con&s;equence, that there is no Idea common to both Sen&s;es.</P>
<P N="130"><PB N="228" REF="234">
CXXX. It is a prevailing Opinion, even a|mong&s;t tho&s;e who have thought and writ mo&s;t ac|curately concerning our Ideas, and the Ways whereby they enter into the Under&s;tanding, that &s;omething more is perceived by Sight, than barely Light and Colours with their Variations. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> termeth Sight, <Q>The mo&s;t Comprehen&s;ive of all our Sen&s;es, conveying to our Minds the Ideas of Light and Colours, which are peculiar only to that Sen&s;e; and al&s;o the far different Ideas of Space, Figure and Motion.</Q> <BIBL><HI>E&s;&s;ay on Human Under&s;tand.</HI> B. ii.

And as for Figure and Exten&s;ion, I leave it to any one, that &s;hall calmly attend to his own clear and di&s;tinct Ideas, to decide whether he has any Idea intro|mitted immediately and properly by Sight, &s;ave only Light and Colours: Or whether it be po&s;&s;ible for him, to frame in his Mind a di&s;tinct Ab&s;tract Idea of Vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion, or Figure, exclu&s;ive of all Colour; and on the other hand, whether he can conceive Colour without Vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion? For my own part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am not able to attain &s;o great a nicety of Ab&s;traction; in a &s;trict Sen&s;e, I &s;ee nothing but Light and Colours, with their &s;everal Shades and Variations. He who be&s;ide the&s;e doth al&s;o perceive by Sight Ideas far different and di&s;tinct from them, hath that Faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehen&s;ive than I can pretend to. It mu&s;t be owned, that by the mediation of Light and Colours, other far different Ideas are &s;ugge&s;ted to my Mind: but &s;o they are by Hearing, which be&s;ide Sounds which are pecu|liar to that Sen&s;e, doth by their mediation &s;ugge&s;t not only Space, Figure and Motion, but al&s;o all other Ideas what&s;oever that can be &s;ignified by Words.</P>

CXXXI. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is, I think, an Axiom univer&s;ally received, that Quantities of the &s;ame kind may be added together, and make one intire Sum. Mathematicians add Lines together; but they do not add a Line to a Solid, or conceive it as making one Sum with a Surface: The&s;e three kinds of Quantity being thought incapable of any &s;uch mutual Addition, and con&s;equently of being compared together, in the &s;everal ways of Pro|portion, are by them e&s;teemed intirely Di&s;parate and Heterogeneous. Now let any one try in his Thoughts to add a Vi&s;ible Line or Surface to a Tangible Line or Surface, &s;o as to conceive them making one continued Sum or Whole. He that can do this, may think them Homogeneous; but he that cannot mu&s;t, by the foregoing Axiom, think them Heterogeneous: A Blue, and a Red Line I can conceive added together into one Sum, and making one continued Line; but to make, in my Thoughts, one continued Line of a Vi&s;ible and Tangible Line added together is, I find, a Task far more difficult, and even in&s;urmountable; and I leave it to the Reflexion and Experience of every particular Per&s;on to determine for him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="132">CXXXII. A farther Confirmation of our Tenet may be drawn from the Solution of Mr. <HI>Molyneux</HI>'s Problem, publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> in his E&s;&s;ay: Which I &s;hall &s;et down as it there lies, together with Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Opinion of it, <Q><HI>Suppo&s;e a Man born Blind, and now Adult, and taught by his Touch to di&s;tingui&s;h between a Cube, and a Sphere of the &s;ame Metal, and nighly of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s, &s;o as to tell, when he felt one and t'other, which is the Cube, and which the Sphere. Suppo&s;e then the Cube and Sphere placed on a Table, and the blind Man to be made to See:</HI> Quaere, <HI>Whether by his</HI>
<PB N="230" REF="236">
<HI>Sight, before he touch'd them, he could now di&s;tin|gui&s;h, and tell, which is the Globe, which the Cube.</HI> To which the acute and judicious Propo&s;er an|&s;wers: <HI>Not. For though he has obtained the Ex|perience of, how a Globe, how a Cube affects his Touch; yet he has not yet attained the Experience, that what affects his Touch &s;o or &s;o, mu&s;t affect his Sight &s;o or &s;o: Or that a protuberant Angle in the Cube, that pre&s;&s;ed his Hand unequally, &s;hall appear to his Eye, as it doth in the Cube.</HI> I agree with this thinking Gentleman, whom I am proud to call my Friend, in his An&s;wer to this his Prob|lem; and am of opinion, that the blind Man, at fir&s;t Sight would not be able with certainty to &s;ay, which was the Globe, which the Cube, whil&s;t he only &s;aw them.</Q> <BIBL><HI>E&s;&s;ay on Human Under|&s;tanding.</HI> B. ii.

<P N="133">CXXXIII. Now, if a Square Surface perceived by Touch be of the &s;ame &s;ort with a Square Sur|face perceived by Sight; it is certain the blind Man here mentioned might know a Square Sur|face, as &s;oon as he &s;aw it: It is no more but in|troduced into his Mind, by a new Inlet, an Idea he has been already well acquainted with. Since therefore he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have known by his Touch, that a Cube is a Body terminated by Square Surfaces; and that a Sphere is not termi|nated by Square Surfaces: upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that a Vi&s;ible and Tangible Square differ only <HI>in numero,</HI> it follows, that he might know, by the unerring mark of the Square Surfaces, which was the Cube, and which not, while he only &s;aw them. We mu&s;t therefore allow, either that Vi&s;ible Ex|ten&s;ion and Figures are &s;pecifically di&s;tinct from Tangible Exten&s;ion and Figures, or el&s;e, that the Solution of this Problem, given by tho&s;e two thoughtful and ingenious Men, is wrong.</P>

Much more might be laid together in Proof of the Propo&s;ition I have advanced: But what has been &s;aid is, if I mi&s;take not, &s;ufficient to convince any one that &s;hall yield a rea&s;onable At|tention: And, as for tho&s;e that will not be at the pains of a little Thought, no Multiplication of Words will ever &s;uffice to make them under&s;tand the Truth, or rightly conceive my Meaning.</P>
<P N="135">CXXXV. I cannot let go the above-mentioned Problem without &s;ome Reflexion on it. It hath been made evident, that a Man blind from his Birth wou'd not, at fir&s;t Sight, denominate any thing he &s;aw, by the Names he had been u&s;ed to appropri|ate to Ideas of Touch, <HI>vid.</HI> SECT. CVI. Cube, Sphere, Table, are Words he has known applied to Things perceivable by Touch, but to Things perfectly Intangible he never knew them appli|ed. Tho&s;e Words in their wonted application, always marked out to his Mind Bodies, or &s;o|lid Things which were perceived by the Re&s;i&s;tance they gave: But there is no Solidity, no Re&s;i&s;tance or Protru&s;ion perceived by Sight. In &s;hort, the Ideas of Sight are all new Perceptions, to which there be no Names annexed in his Mind; he can|not therefore under&s;tand what is &s;aid to him con|cerning them: And to ask of the two Bodies he &s;aw placed on the Table, which was the Sphere, which the Cube, were, to him, a Que&s;tion down|right bantering and unintelligible; nothing he &s;ees being able to &s;ugge&s;t to his Thoughts, the Idea of Body, Di&s;tance, or in general, of any thing he had already known.</P>
<P N="136">CXXXVI. It is a mi&s;take, to think the &s;ame thing affects both Sight and Touch. If the &s;ame Angle or Square, which is the Object of Touch, be al&s;o the Object of Vi&s;ion, what &s;hou'd hinder

For though the Manner wherein it affects the Sight, be different from that wherein it affected his Touch; yet, there being, be&s;ide this Manner or Circum&s;tance, which is new and unknown, the Angle or Figure, which is old and known, he can|not choo&s;e but di&s;cern it.</P>
<P N="137">CXXXVII. Vi&s;ible Figure and Exten&s;ion hav|ing been demon&s;trated to be of a nature, intirely different and heterogeneous from tangible Figure and Exten&s;ion, it remains that we inquire concern|ing Motion. Now that vi&s;ible Motion is not of the &s;ame &s;ort with tangible Motion, &s;eems to need no farther Proof, it being an evident Corollary from what we have &s;hewn concerning the Difference there is between vi&s;ible and tangible Exten&s;ion: But for a more full and expre&s;s Proof hereof, we need only ob&s;erve, that one who had not yet ex|perienced Vi&s;ion, wou'd not at fir&s;t &s;ight know Motion. Whence it clearly follows, that Motion perceivable by Sight is of a &s;ort di&s;tinct from Mo|tion perceivable by Touch. The Antecedent I prove thus: By Touch he cou'd not perceive any Motion, but what was up or down, to the right or left, nearer or farther from him; be&s;ides the&s;e, and their &s;everal Varieties or Complications, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hou'd have any Idea of Motion. He wou'd not therefore think any thing to be Motion, or give the name Motion to any Idea, which he cou'd not range under &s;ome or other of tho&s;e par|ticular kinds thereof. But from SECT. XCV, it is plain that by the meer act of Vi&s;ion, he cou'd not know Motion upwards or downwards, to the right or left, or in any other po&s;&s;ible Direction. From which I conclude, he wou'd not know Motion at all at fir&s;t &s;ight. As for the Idea of Motion in Ab&s;tract, I &s;hall not wa&s;te Paper about it, but
<PB N="233" REF="239">
leave it to my Reader, to make the be&s;t he can on't. To me it is perfectly Unintelligible.</P>
<P N="138">CXXXVIII. The Con&s;ideration of Motion may furni&s;h a new Field for Inquiry: But &s;ince the Man|ner wherein the Mind apprehends by Sight, the Motion of Tangible Objects, with the various De|grees thereof, may be ea&s;ily collected, from what hath been &s;aid concerning the Manner, wherein that Sen&s;e doth &s;ugge&s;t their various Di&s;tances, Magnitudes and Situations, I &s;hall not enlarge any farther on this Subject, but proceed to inquire what may be alledged with greate&s;t appearance of Rea&s;on, again&s;t the Propo&s;ition we have &s;hewn to be true: For where there is &s;o much Prejudice to be encountered, a bare and naked Demon&s;tration of the Truth will &s;carce &s;uffice. We mu&s;t al&s;o &s;atisfy the Scruples that Men may rai&s;e in favour of their preconceived Notions, &s;hew whence the mi&s;take ari&s;es, how it came to &s;pread, and carefully di&s;|clo&s;e and root out tho&s;e fal&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ions, that an early Prejudice might have implanted in the Mind.</P>
<P N="139">CXXXIX. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Therefore, it will be demand|ed, how vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion and Figures come to be called by the &s;ame Name, with tangible Exten&s;ion and Figures, if they are not of the &s;ame kind with them? It mu&s;t be &s;omething more than Humour or Accident, that cou'd occa&s;ion a Cu&s;tom &s;o con|&s;tant and univer&s;al as this, which has obtained in all Ages and Nations of the World, and among&s;t all Ranks of Men, the Learned as well as the Il|literate.</P>
<P N="140">CXL. To which I an&s;wer, we can no more ar|gue a vi&s;ible and tangible Square to be of the &s;ame Species, from their being called by the &s;ame Name,
<PB N="234" REF="240">
than we can, that a tangible Square and the Mo|no&s;yllable con&s;i&s;ting of Six Letters, whereby it is marked, are of the &s;ame Species becau&s;e they are both called by the &s;ame Name. It is cu&s;tomary to call written Words, and the Things they &s;ignify, by the &s;ame Name: For Words not being regarded in their own Nature, or otherwi&s;e than as they are Marks of Things, it had been &s;uperfluous, and be&s;ide the de&s;ign of Language, to have given them Names di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the Things marked by them. The &s;ame Rea&s;on holds here al&s;o. Vi&s;i|ble Figures are the Marks of tangible Figures, and from SECT. LIX. it is plain, that in them&s;elves they are little regarded, or upon any other Score than for their Connexion with tangible Figures, which by Nature they are ordained to &s;ignify. And becau&s;e this Language of Nature does not vary in different Ages or Nations, hence it is, that in all Times and Places, vi&s;ible Figures are called by the &s;ame Names, as the re&s;pective tangible Figures &s;ugge&s;ted by them, and not becau&s;e they are alike, or of the &s;ame &s;ort with them.</P>
<P N="141">CXLI. But, &s;ay you, &s;urely a tangible Square is liker to a vi&s;ible Square, than to a vi&s;ible Circle: It has four Angles, and as many Sides; &s;o al&s;o has the vi&s;ible Square, but the vi&s;ible Circle has no &s;uch thing, being bounded by one uniform Curve, without right Lines or Angles, which makes it un|fit to repre&s;ent the tangible Square, but very fit to repre&s;ent the tangible Circle. Whence it clearly follows, that vi&s;ible Figures are Patrons of, or of the &s;ame Species with the re&s;pective tangible Fi|gures repre&s;ented by them; that they are like unto them, and of their own Nature fitted to repre&s;ent them, as being of the &s;ame &s;ort; and that they are in no re&s;pect arbitrary Signs, as Words.</P>
<P N="142"><PB N="235" REF="241">
CXLII. I an&s;wer, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, the vi&s;ible Square is fitter than the vi&s;ible Circle, to repre&s;ent the tangible Square, but then it is not be|cau&s;e it is liker, or more of a Species with it; but becau&s;e the vi&s;ible Square contains in it &s;everal di&s;tinct Parts, whereby to mark the &s;everal di&s;tinct, corre&s;ponding Parts of a tangible Square, whereas the vi&s;ible Circle doth not. The Square perceived by Touch, hath four di&s;tinct, equal Sides, &s;o al&s;o hath it four di&s;tinct equal Angles. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that the vi&s;ible Figures which &s;hall be mo&s;t proper to mark it, contain four di&s;tinct equal Parts corre&s;ponding to the four Sides of the tangible Square; as likewi&s;e four other di&s;tinct and equal Parts, whereby to denote the four equal Angles of the tangible Square. And accordingly we &s;ee the vi&s;ible Figures contain in them di&s;tinct vi&s;ible Parts, an&s;wering to the di&s;tinct tangible Parts of the Fi|gures &s;ignified, or &s;ugge&s;ted by them.</P>
<P N="143">CXLIII. But it will not hence follow, that any vi&s;ible Figure is like unto, or of the &s;ame Species with its corre&s;ponding tangible Figure, unle&s;s it be al&s;o &s;hewen, that not only the Number, but al&s;o the Kind of the Parts be the &s;ame in both. To illu&s;trate this, I ob&s;erve that vi&s;ible Figures repre|&s;ent tangible Figures, much after the &s;ame manner that written Words do Sounds. Now, in this re|&s;pect, Words are not arbitrary, it not being in|different, what written Word &s;tands for any Sound: But it is requi&s;ite, that each Word con|tain in it &s;o many di&s;tinct Characters, as there are Variations in the Sound in &s;tands for. Thus the &s;ingle Letter <HI>a</HI> is proper to mark one &s;imple uni|form Sound; and the word <HI>Adultery</HI> is accommo|dated to repre&s;ent the Sound annexed to it, in
<PB N="236" REF="242">
the Formation whereof, there being eight different Colli&s;ions, or Modifications of the Air by the Organs of Speech, each of which produces a diffe|rence of Sound, it was fit, the Word repre&s;enting it &s;hou'd con&s;i&s;t of as many di&s;tinct Characters, thereby to mark each particular Difference or Part of the whole Sound: And yet no Body, I pre&s;ume will &s;ay, the &s;ingle Letter <HI>a,</HI> or the word <HI>Adultery</HI> are like unto, or of the &s;ame Species with the re|&s;pective Sounds by them repre&s;ented. It is indeed arbitrary that, in general, Letters of any Lan|guage repre&s;ent Sounds at all; but when that is once agreed, it is not arbitrary what Combination of Letters &s;hall repre&s;ent this or that particular Sound. I leave this with the Reader to pur&s;ue, and apply it in his own Thoughts.</P>
<P N="144">CXLIV. It mu&s;t be confe&s;t that we are not &s;o apt to confound other Signs with the Things &s;igni|fied, or to think them of the &s;ame Species, as we are vi&s;ible and tangible Ideas. But a little Con&s;i|deration will &s;hew us how this may be, without our &s;uppo&s;ing them of a like Nature. The&s;e Signs are con&s;tant and univer&s;al, their Connexion with tangible Ideas has been learnt at our fir&s;t Entrance into the World; and ever &s;ince, almo&s;t every Mo|ment of our Lives, it has been occurring to our Thoughts, and fa&s;tening and &s;triking deeper on our Minds. When we ob&s;erve that Signs are variable, and of Humane In&s;titution; when we remember, there was a time they were not connected in our Minds, with tho&s;e things they now &s;o readily &s;ug|ge&s;t; but that their Signification was learned by the &s;low Steps of Experience: This pre&s;erves us from confounding them. But when we find the &s;ame Signs &s;ugge&s;t the &s;ame Things all over the World; when we know they are not of Humane
<PB N="237" REF="243">
In&s;titution, and cannot remember that we ever learned their Signification, but think that at fir&s;t Sight they would have &s;ugge&s;ted to us the &s;ame Things they do now: All this per&s;uades us they are of the &s;ame Species as the Things re&s;pectively repre&s;ented by them, and that it is by a natural Re&s;emblance they &s;ugge&s;t them to our Minds.</P>
<P N="145">CXLV. Add to this, that whenever we make a nice Survey of any Object, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively directing the Optic Axis to each Point thereof; there are certain Lines and Figures de&s;cribed by the Motion of the Head or Eye, which being in truth perceiv|ed by Feeling, do neverthele&s;s &s;o mix them&s;elves as it were, with the Ideas of Sight, that we can &s;carce think but they appertain to that Sen&s;e. A|gain, the Ideas of Sight enter into the Mind, &s;eve|ral at once more di&s;tinct and unmingled, than is u&s;ual in the other Sen&s;es be&s;ide the Touch. Sounds, for example, perceived at the &s;ame In|&s;tant, are apt to coale&s;ce, if I may &s;o &s;ay, into one Sound: But we can perceive at the &s;ame time great variety of vi&s;ible Objects, very &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from each other. Now tangible Exten&s;i|on being made up of &s;everal Di&s;tinct coexi&s;tent parts, we may hence gather another Rea&s;on, that may di&s;po&s;e us to imagine a Likene&s;s or Analogy between the immediate Objects of Sight and Touch. But nothing, certainly, doth more contribute to blend and confound them together, than the &s;trict and clo&s;e Connexion they have with each other. We cannot open our Eyes, but the Ideas of Di&s;|tance, Bodies, and tangible Figures are &s;ugge&s;ted by them. So &s;wift and &s;udden, and unperceiv'd is the Tran&s;ition from vi&s;ible to tangible Ideas, that we can &s;carce forbear thinking them equally the im|mediate Object of Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="146"><PB N="238" REF="244">
CXLVI. The Prejudice, which is grounded on the&s;e, and whatever other Cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;igned thereof, &s;ticks &s;o fa&s;t, that it is impo&s;&s;ible with|out ob&s;tinate Striving, and Labour of the Mind, to get intirely clear of it. But then the Reluctan|cy we find, in rejecting any Opinion, can be no Argument of its Truth, to whoever con&s;iders what has been already &s;hewn, with regard to the Prejudices we entertain concerning the Di&s;tance, Magnitude, and Situation of Objects; Prejudices &s;o familiar to our Minds, &s;o confirmed and inve|terate, as they will hardly give way to the cleare&s;t Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P N="147">CXLVII. Upon the whole, I think we may fairly conclude, that the proper Objects of Vi&s;ion con&s;titute an Univer&s;al Language of the Author of Nature, whereby we are in&s;tructed how to regu|late our Actions, in order to attain tho&s;e things, that are nece&s;&s;ary to the Pre&s;ervation and Well-being of our Bodies, as al&s;o to avoid whatever may be hurtful and de&s;tructive of them. It is by their Information that we are principally guided in all the Tran&s;actions and Concerns of Life. And the manner wherein they &s;ignify, and mark unto us the Objects which are at a Di&s;tance, is the &s;ame with that of Languages and Signs of Humane Appoint|ment, which do not &s;ugge&s;t the things &s;ignified, by any likene&s;s or Indentity of Nature, but only by an habitual Connexion, that Experience has made us to ob&s;erve between them.</P>
<P N="148">CXLVIII. Suppo&s;e one who had always conti|nued Blind, be told by his Guide, that after he has advanced &s;o many Steps, he &s;hall come to the Brink of a Precipice, or be &s;topt by a Wall; mu&s;t not
<PB N="239" REF="245">
this to him &s;eem very admirable and &s;urprizing? He cannot conceive how it is po&s;&s;ible for Mortals to frame &s;uch Predictions as the&s;e, which to him would &s;eem as &s;trange and unaccountable, as Pro|phe&s;y doth to others. Even they who are ble&s;&s;ed with the vi&s;ive Faculty, may (though familiarity make it le&s;s ob&s;erved) find therein &s;ufficient Cau&s;e of Admiration. The wonderful Art and Contri|vance wherewith it is adju&s;ted to tho&s;e Ends and Purpo&s;es for which it was apparently de&s;igned, the va&s;t Extent, Number, and Variety of Objects that are at once with &s;o much ea&s;e, and quickne&s;s, and plea&s;ure &s;ugge&s;ted by it: All the&s;e afford Subject for much and plea&s;ing Speculation, and may, if a|ny thing, give us &s;ome glimmering, analogous Prae|notion of Things, which are placed beyond the certain Di&s;covery and Comprehen&s;ion of our pre|&s;ent State.</P>
<P N="149">CXLIX. I do not de&s;ign to trouble my &s;elf with drawing Corollaries, from the Doctrine I have hi|therto laid down. If it bears the Te&s;t, others may, &s;o far as they &s;hall think convenient, employ their Thoughts in extending it farther, and applying it to whatever Purpo&s;es it may be &s;ub&s;ervient to: Only, I cannot forbear making &s;ome Inquiry con|cerning the Object of Geometry, which the Subject we have been upon doth naturally lead one to. We have &s;hewn there is no &s;uch Idea as that of Exten|&s;ion in Ab&s;tract, and that there are two kinds of &s;en&s;ible Exten&s;ion and Figures, which are intirely di&s;tinct and heterogeneous from each other. Now, it is natural to inquire which of the&s;e is the Object of Geometry.</P>
<P N="150">CL. Some things there are, which at fir&s;t &s;ight incline one to think Geometry conver&s;ant about
<PB N="240" REF="246">
Vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion. The con&s;tant u&s;e of the Eyes, both in the practical and &s;peculative Parts of that Science doth very much induce us thereto. It would, without doubt, &s;eem odd to a Mathemati|cian to go about to convince him, the Diagrams he &s;aw upon Paper were not the Figures, or even the Likene&s;s of the Figures, which make the Subject of the Demon&s;tration. The contrary being held an unque&s;tionable Truth, not only by Mathematicians, but al&s;o by tho&s;e who apply them&s;elves more par|ticularly to the Study of Logick; I mean, who con&s;ider the Nature of Science, Certainty and De|mon&s;tration: It being by them a&s;&s;igned as one Rea|&s;on, of the extraordinary Clearne&s;s and Evidence of Geometry, that in this Science the Rea&s;onings are free from tho&s;e Inconveniencies, which attend the u&s;e of arbitrary Signs, the very Ideas them&s;elves being copied out, and expo&s;ed to view upon Paper. But, by the bye, how well this agrees with what they likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ert of ab&s;tract Ideas, being the Object of Geometrical Demon&s;tration, I leave to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="151">CLI. To come to a Re&s;olution in this Point, we need only ob&s;erve what hath been &s;aid in SECT. LIX. LX. LXI. where it is &s;hewn that vi&s;ible Ex|ten&s;ions in them&s;elves are little regarded, and have no &s;ettled determinate Greatne&s;s, and that Men mea&s;ure altogether, by the Application of Tangi|ble Exten&s;ion to Tangible Exten&s;ion. All which makes it evident, that Vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion and Fi|gures are not the Object of Geometry.</P>
<P N="152">CLII. It is therefore plain that Vi&s;ible Figures are of the &s;ame U&s;e in Geometry, that Words are: And the one may as well be accounted the Object of that Science, as the other; neither of them be|ing
<PB N="241" REF="247">
any otherwi&s;e concerned therein, than as they repre&s;ent or &s;ugge&s;t to the Mind the particular Tangible Figures connected with them. There is indeed this Difference between the Signification of Tangible Figures by Vi&s;ible Figures, and of Ideas by Words: That whereas the Latter is variable and uncertain, depending altogether on the Arbi|trary Appointment of Men, the former is fixed, and immutably the &s;ame in all Times and Places. A Vi&s;ible Square, for In&s;tance, &s;ugge&s;ts to the Mind the &s;ame Tangible Figure in <HI>Europe,</HI> that it doth in <HI>America.</HI> Hence it is that the Voice of the Author of Nature, which &s;peaks to our Eyes, is not liable to that Mi&s;interpretation and Ambiguity, that Languages of Humane Contrivance are un|avoidably &s;ubject to.</P>
<P N="153">CLIII. Though what has been &s;aid may &s;uffice to &s;hew what ought to be determined, with rela|lation to the Object of Geometry; I &s;hall never|thele&s;s, for the fuller illu&s;tration thereof, con&s;i|der the Ca&s;e of an Intelligence, or unbodied Spi|rit, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ee perfectly well, <HI>i. e.</HI> to have a clear Perception of the proper and imme|diate Objects of Sight, but to have no Sen&s;e of Touch. Whether there be any &s;uch Being in Na|ture or no, is be&s;ide my purpo&s;e to inquire. It &s;ufficeth, that the Suppo&s;ition contains no Contra|diction in it. Let us now examine, what Profici|ency &s;uch a one may be able to make in Geometry. Which Speculation will lead us more clearly to &s;ee, whether the Ideas of Sight can po&s;&s;ibly be the Ob|ject of that Science.</P>
<P N="154">CLIV. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> then it is certain, the afore&s;aid Intelligence could have no Idea of a Solid, or Quantity of three Dimen&s;ions, which followeth
<PB N="242" REF="248">
from its not having any Idea of Di&s;tance. We in|deed are prone to think, that we have by Sight the Ideas of Space and Solids, which ari&s;eth from our imagining that we do, &s;trictly &s;peaking, &s;ee Di|&s;tance, and &s;ome parts of an Object at a greater di&s;tance than others, which hath been demon&s;trat|ed to be the Effect of the Experience we have had, what Ideas of Touch are connected with &s;uch and &s;uch Ideas attending Vi&s;ion: But the Intelligence here &s;poken of is &s;uppo&s;ed to have no Experience of Touch. He wou'd not, therefore judge as we do, nor have any Idea of Di&s;tance, Outne&s;s, or Profundity, nor con&s;equently of Space or Body, either immediately or by Sugge&s;tion. Whence it is plain, he can have no Notion of tho&s;e Parts of Geometry, which relate to the Men&s;uration of Solids, and their Convex or Concave Surfaces, and contemplate the Properties of Lines generat|ed by the Section of a Solid. The conceiving of any part whereof, is beyond the reach of his Faculties.</P>
<P N="155">CLV. Farther, he cannot comprehend the Manner wherein Geometers de&s;cribe a right Line or Circle; the Rule and Compa&s;s with their u&s;e, being things of which it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have any Notion: Nor is it an ea&s;ier matter for him to conceive the placing of one Plain or Angle on another, in order to prove their Equality: Since that &s;uppo&s;eth &s;ome Idea of Di&s;tance, or External Space. All which makes it evident, our pure Intelligence could never attain to know &s;o much as the fir&s;t Elements of plain Geometry. And perhaps, upon a nice Inquiry, it will be found, he cannot even have an Idea of plain Fi|gures any more than he can of Solids; &s;ince &s;ome Idea of Di&s;tance is nece&s;&s;ary, to form the Idea of
<PB N="243" REF="249">
a Geometrical Plain, as will appear to whoever &s;hall reflect a little on it.</P>
<P N="156">CLVI. All that is properly perceived by the vi&s;ive Faculty, amounts to no more than Colours with their Variations, and different Proportions of Light and Shade: But, the perpectual Mutabi|lity, and Fleetingne&s;s of tho&s;e immediate Objects of Sight, render them incapable of being manag|ed after the manner of Geometrical Figures; nor is it in any Degree u&s;eful that they &s;hould. It is true, there are divers of them perceived at once; and more of &s;ome, and le&s;s of others: But accu|rately to compute their Magnitude, and a&s;&s;ign pre|ci&s;e determinate Proportions, between Things &s;o variable and incon&s;tant, if we &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible to be done, mu&s;t yet be a very trifling and in&s;ig|nificant Labour.</P>
<P N="157">CLVII. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it &s;eems to be the O|pinion of &s;ome ingenious Men, that flat or plain Figures are immediate Objects of Sight, though they acknowledge Solids are not. And this O|pinion of theirs is grounded on what is ob&s;erved in Painting, wherein (&s;ay they) the Ideas imme|diately imprinted on the Mind, are only of Plains variou&s;ly coloured, which by a &s;udden Act of the Judgment are changed into Solids: But, with a little Attention we &s;hall find the Plains here men|tioned, as the immediate Objects of Sight, are not Vi&s;ible but Tangible Plains. For when we &s;ay that Pictures are Plains: we mean thereby, that they appear to the Touch &s;mooth and uniform. But then this Smoothne&s;s and Uniformity, or, in other Words, this Plainne&s;s of the Picture, is not perceived immediately by Vi&s;ion: For it appear|eth to the Eye various and multiform.</P>
<P N="158"><PB N="244" REF="250">
CLVIII. From all which we may conclude, that Plains are no more the immediate Object of Sight than Solids. What we &s;trictly &s;ee are not Solids, nor yet Plains variou&s;ly coloured; they are only diver&s;ity of Colours. And &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;t to the Mind Solids, and others plain Fi|gures; ju&s;t as they have been experienced to be con|nected with the one, or the other: So that we &s;ee Plains, in the &s;ame way that we &s;ee Solids; both being equally &s;ugge&s;ted by the immediate Objects of Sight, which accordingly are them&s;elves de|nominated Plains and Solids: But though they are called by the &s;ame Names, with the Things mark|ed by them, they are neverthele&s;s of a Nature in|tirely different, as hath been demon&s;trated.</P>
<P N="159">CLIX. What hath been &s;aid is, if I mi&s;take not, &s;ufficient to decide the Que&s;tion we propo&s;e to examine, concerning the Ability of a pure Spi|rit, &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed, to know <HI>Geometry:</HI> It is, indeed, no ea&s;y matter for us to enter pre|ci&s;ely into the Thoughts of &s;uch an Intelligence; becau&s;e we cannot, without great Pains, cleverly &s;eparate and di&s;intangle in our Thoughts the pro|per Objects of Sight from tho&s;e of Touch which are connected with them. This, indeed, in a compleat Degree, &s;eems &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to be per|formed: Which will not &s;eem &s;trange to us, if we con&s;ider how hard it is, for any one to hear the Words of his Native Language pronounced in his Ears without under&s;tanding them. Though he endeavour to di&s;unite the meaning from the Sound, it will neverthele&s;s intrude into his Thoughts, and he &s;hall find it extreme difficult, if not impo&s;|&s;ible, to put him&s;elf exactly in the Po&s;ture of a Foreigner, that never learned the Language, &s;o
<PB N="245" REF="251">
as to be affected barely with the Sounds them&s;elves, and not perceive the Signification annexed to them By this time, I &s;uppo&s;e, it is clear that neither Ab&s;tract, not Vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion makes the Object of Geometry; the not di&s;cerning of which may perhaps, have created &s;ome Difficulty and u&s;ele&s;s Labour in Mathematics.</P>
