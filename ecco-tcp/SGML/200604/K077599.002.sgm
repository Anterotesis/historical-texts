<HEAD TYPE="sub">1706.<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the &s;tate of affairs in Scotland was calculated to rai&s;e
the hopes of the court of St. Germains, the Stuart papers for
this year are more curious than important. The Scoti&s;h Jaco|bites
were re&s;olved to ri&s;k every thing to prevent the union, and the
con&s;equent &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line. The French
had given them &s;ome expectations of &s;upport; but the battles of Ramil|lies
and Turin di&s;concerted all their mea&s;ures. The French King de|clared
that he could &s;pare neither men nor money at pre&s;ent; but that
he would &s;earch for a more favourable conjuncture to give them the aid
they required. The Tories in England were more cautious than the Ja|cobites
of Scotland. They wi&s;hed for the re&s;toration of the excluded
family; but they were unwilling to agree to any attempt, during the life
of Queen Anne. They held no direct communication with the court of
St. Germains. The agents of that court, however, had acce&s;s, as u&s;ual,
to Marlborough and Godolphin, who &s;eemed to give private a&s;&s;urances
of zeal for the Pretender, when they, particularly the former, publickly
avowed their attachment to the hou&s;e of Hannover, while both promoted
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line. It appears that the excluded family
had turned their eyes, as early as the pre&s;ent year, towards the King of
Sweden; who, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of Saxony, and dethroning King
Augu&s;tus, became, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the umpire of the affairs of Eu|rope.</P>

<HEAD>Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters, continued.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Ca|ryll's Letters, vol. v. fol. Scotch Col|lege. February 21.</NOTE>"THIS is to let you know that your cou&s;in Wi&s;ely [the King] is
very well plea&s;ed with the care you take to pre&s;erve her right in
rever&s;ion upon her kin&s;woman's [Queen Anne's] death; and &s;he very
well approves of the method you propo&s;e of con&s;ulting with Mr. Goul|&s;ton
[Godolphin] concerning what is be&s;t to be done in it: con&s;idering
all pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, without doubt that lawyer is better able than
any other, both to advi&s;e and to act effectually in this affair, if he were
willing to undertake it. But of that I mu&s;t doubt, con&s;idering his be|haviour
in your cou&s;in's former claim of right to her e&s;tate in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;
however, your cou&s;in gives you full commi&s;&s;ion to act and proceed in the
way you &s;hall think be&s;t for his intere&s;t. And when you have con&s;ulted
the above-named lawyer, you will be better able to take your mea&s;ures,
and to inform your cou&s;in how matters are likely to go.</P>
<P><DATE>March 21.</DATE> What you now write concerning that part of the quit-rents
which are lately become due to your cou&s;in Wi&s;ely [the King]
&s;ufficiently &s;hews her undoubted right to them according to law; but I
fear there will be many difficulties, not ea&s;y to overcome, that will ob|&s;truct
her getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, through the neglect of her tru&s;tee,
of which we &s;hall know more, when you have conferred with Mr. Goul|&s;ton
[Godolphin] about it. Your cou&s;in's title is certainly good in law,
both again&s;t Young [prince&s;s Anne] and again&s;t that other per&s;on [Han|nover]
who&s;e name I forgot, who at pre&s;ent, as you &s;ay, puts in a claim.
I am glad to hear you &s;ay that tho&s;e who have long &s;ince &s;o often pro|mi&s;ed
to pay Ple&s;&s;ington's [the King's] debts, make &s;teps as if they did
de&s;ign to be hone&s;t at la&s;t; though I do not find that you have had any
fre&s;h a&s;&s;urance from Mr. Arm&s;worth [Marlborough] or Mr. Gilburn
[Godolphin], who I know are full of other bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><DATE>April 5.</DATE> What I hear concerning Hanmer [Hannover] and his
knight [Sir Rowland Gwyne] is very extraordinary, and I believe will
make &s;ome divi&s;ion in Wanley's [the Whigs] family, of which &s;ome are
for joining immediately in company with the merchant Hanmer [Han|nover],
and others of them, with Mr. Brag [in the parliament] have pub|licly
appeared again&s;t it. I al&s;o believe that tho&s;e few of Kenzy's
relations [Tories], that &s;tood up for Hanmer [Hannover], have done
<PB N="3" REF="12">
but little good either to Hanmer [Hannover] or to them&s;elves. It is
very probable, as you &s;ay, that the two merchants, Goul&s;ton [Godol|phin]
and Arm&s;worth [Marlborough] have had a great hand in all this,
but whether with an hone&s;t intention of paying their old debts or not,
time mu&s;t &s;how. You are much in the right not to move in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of the quit-rents, lately fallen in, whil&s;t Mr. Brag [parliament] is
in town, and that will come on better next term. In the mean time,
you may have opportunity of con&s;ulting with Mr. Goul&s;ton [Godolphin]
about it, and as you may find him di&s;po&s;ed, you may make a pretty
near gue&s;s of the &s;ucce&s;s of that and of other matters.</P>
<P><DATE>April 25.</DATE> I &s;hould be very glad to hear of your having had &s;ome
communication with Mr. Arm&s;worth [Marlborough] about the old
debts, before his going into the country [abroad]; but if that cannot be,
I hope at lea&s;t that &s;omething will be &s;aid about that matter to captain
Gourdon [colonel Sackville], of which I &s;uppo&s;e you will have an ac|count.</P>
<P><DATE>June 6.</DATE> I find that your kin&s;man, Mr. Wi&s;ely [the King], is very
well plea&s;ed with the way in which you proceed about the recovery of
that part of the quit-rents lately fallen in, and applying them to the
payment of the debts formerly contracted. As to the &s;ucce&s;s of this
matter, much will depend upon the hone&s;ty of Mr. Young's &s;olicitor,
[the prince&s;s of Denmark's mini&s;ter] Goul&s;ton [Godolphin], for he has in
his hands wherewithall to clear that matter, and therefore a &s;ea&s;onable
application ought to be made to him.</P>
<P>Being a per&s;on concerned in the&s;e debts, though I can pretend no
great &s;kill in the law, yet I &s;hould be glad the&s;e queries might be made
to tho&s;e that are of Wi&s;ely's [Queen's] council: 1&s;t, Whether Wi&s;ely
has not at pre&s;ent a clear title in law, as it now &s;tands, to tho&s;e quit-rents?
2dly, And if &s;o, whether he may not make them over to &s;ome
tru&s;tees, for the payment of tho&s;e debts, by a deed that will &s;tand good
in law? This I mention becau&s;e I do not &s;ee, at pre&s;ent, how the title
is devolved from Wi&s;ely [the King] to Young [Queen Anne]; but you
that are upon the place can better judge of the&s;e matters.</P>
<P><DATE>June 28.</DATE> In your la&s;t you gave full &s;atisfaction to the two que|ries
I had put to you in mine of the &s;ixth of June; &s;o that nothing
<PB N="4" REF="13">
otherwi&s;e is to be done in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the quit-rents than according to
the plan laid down by you, by the advice of coun&s;el upon the place
for, as you &s;ay, Mr. Brag [parliament] is a very angry gentleman naturally,
and his bitterne&s;s ought not to be &s;tirred. Mr. Manning's [the King of
France] affairs have gone &s;o much backwards of late, that there is little
hope of his being able to lay down the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary to redeem the
mortgage (an army for an inva&s;ion), &s;o that we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make
the be&s;t of the promi&s;es given, by tho&s;e other merchants, which you
know have been &s;uch, as no hone&s;t man could make and not perform,
when able to do &s;o. Nor is there, at pre&s;ent, any que&s;tion to be made
of their ability, having almo&s;t all the trade in their hands; &s;o that, if
they fail in the performance, the &s;hame will be theirs, and the lo&s;s
will be ours."</P>

<P>"THE earl of Leven, commander in chief and ma&s;ter of the ord|nance,
a notorious whig and Hannoverian. The earl of Lothian,
major general, &s;uch as the commander in chief, but of le&s;s capacity.
James Maitland, major general, a &s;oldier &s;ince he was a man; and if his
capacity is as good as his experience is long, he may be a good officer.
He is thought to have &s;ome good inclinations; and it is pre&s;umed he
may be treated with.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">
The regiment of guards, without a colonel &s;ince Ram&s;ay's death,
con&s;i&s;ts of 16 companies, each company 40 men, including &s;erjeants,
corporals, and drums, is 640.</P>
<P>The earl of Dalhou&s;ie, fir&s;t lieutenant colonel, a young man with a
very &s;mall e&s;tate, no good manager, has debts, and &s;ometimes forced to
take &s;anctuary in the abbey of Holyrood-Hou&s;e; but being of a loyal
family and &s;o educated, it is pre&s;umed he has good inclinations; and it
may be rea&s;onably expected, that the King's pre&s;ence will draw him, and
all &s;uch to his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t and &s;ervice. The other lieutenant colonel
&mdash;Stewart, brother to the earl of Galloway, is thought to have good
inclinations; and to my certain knowledge, he was for the grand re&s;olve.
The major and following officers of this regiment, are reputed well
affected; Thomas Hamilton, &s;econd major, John Murray, James Scott,
John Hamilton, William Sharp,&mdash;Scott,&mdash;Stewart, captains; William
Murray and James Ogilvie, lieutenants; the fir&s;t two captains, and
the two lieutenants, I know to be &s;o.</P>
<P>The troop of hor&s;e guards, commanded by the earl of Argyle, con|&s;i&s;ts
of 100 gentlemen; at lea&s;t, &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>The lord Forbes, fir&s;t lieutenant, a bigotted whig, little &s;en&s;e, little
e&s;tate, and di&s;loyal. My lord Ballantyne, the other lieutenant, one of a
very ordinary capacity and little or no e&s;tate; at the revolution, and for
&s;everal years after, was e&s;teemed very loyal; but having &s;quandered a
good e&s;tate, and falling in with the duke of Queen&s;berry, he bought him,
at the price of his po&s;t. Mr. John Kerr, the fir&s;t cornet, &s;uch as the
captain; the other Archibald Douglas, was at and after the Revolution
thought very loyal, and is &s;till reputed well affected; but much under
the influence of the duke of Queen&s;berry. I am credibly informed, that
many of the gentlemen of the troop are well affected.</P>
<P>Two troops, or companies of grenadiers, on hor&s;eback; each con&s;i&s;t|ing
of 30 men, ranked as guards, 60.</P>
<P>The earl of Crawford, colonel, a good-natured man, and brave; has
little or no e&s;tate, and influenced by the earl of Arran. The captains of
<HI>(&s;ome words illegible)</HI> lord Cumberland, olde&s;t &s;on to the earl of
Balcarras, and&mdash;Chrichton, heir male to the late earl of Dumfries.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="15">
The fir&s;t is a very young gentleman, that &s;eems to promi&s;e no great
things; the other is thought to have &s;ome good inclinations towards the
King.</P>
<P>Major general Maitland's regiment, in the garri&s;on of Inverlochy, con|&s;i&s;ts
(as I remember) of twelve companies; each company 40 men, in|cluding
&s;erjeants, corporals, and drums, 480.</P>
<P>Robert Keith, fir&s;t lieutenant colonel. I have known him from my
infancy. He always was before, and at the Revolution, very loyal; but I
think, &s;ince that unhappy time, he is much corrupted in his principles; yet,
at the &s;ame time, I judge his old imbibed loyalty is not entirely wore out,
but that he may be retrieved; and, if I am commanded or permitted,
I will u&s;e my be&s;t endeavours to per&s;uade and engage him to his duty;
for I know he has a great friend&s;hip for me, and will not deceive me.
The other lieutenant colonel of this regiment, is Mr. Patrick Ogilvie,
&s;econd &s;on to the earl of Findlater, who will always be &s;uch as his bro|ther,
at lea&s;t &s;o long as he is chancellor. Yet he has many times, with
great a&s;&s;everations, &s;aid, that he never would do any thing again&s;t the
King's intere&s;t. Other officers of that regiment I know not; but in
general, I am informed, that &s;ome of them are well affected, and it is
pre&s;umed, many of the common &s;oldiers are &s;o, becau&s;e mo&s;t of them
are Highlandmen, and of con&s;equence thought loyal.</P>
<P>Lord Strathnaver's regiment of foot, con&s;i&s;ts of 10 companies; each
company 30 men, including &s;erjeants, corporals, and drums, is 300.</P>
<P>This colonel is a very young man, and his father, the earl of Suther|land,
being of ill principles, it may rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed he is &s;o.
Yet I am told by &s;ome of his relations, that he is much better di&s;po&s;ed
than his father. The earl of Glencairn, lieutenant colonel, I know is
loyally inclined; and I have it from mo&s;t unque&s;tionable authors, that
he has often &s;aid, he never would do any thing again&s;t the King, and,
as I remember, he voted the grand re&s;olution; and &s;everal captains and
&s;ubalterns in the regiment are reputed well affected.</P>
<P>The laird of Grant, younger; his regiment is in companies, and num|ber
of men, the &s;ame with Strathnaver's, 300.</P>
<P>The colonel before he got the regiment, was reputed loyal; but &s;ince
he had it, by Argyle's procurement, he is con&s;idered, as much influenced
<PB N="7" REF="16">
by that lord. Bruce of Kennith, the lieutenant colonel, is reputed
loyal, as are &s;everal other officers in that regiment.</P>
<P>The earl of Lothian's regiment of dragoons, as I remember, con&s;i&s;ts
of &s;ix companies; each company, including &s;erjeants, corporal, and
drum, is 30 men, 180.</P>
<P>The colonel's character is already given. The lieutenant colonel is
&s;on to Pollwarth, now called earl of Marchmont; when the late earl of
Hume li&s;ted, this lieutenant colonel was thought well affected, and very
much under the influence of Hume; but what to &s;ay of him now, I
know not.</P>
<P>The major of this regiment, John John&s;ton, of We&s;traw, is reputed
to have loyal inclinations, being much managed that way by his very
loyal lady; but he is much under the influence of his chief, the earl of
Annandale, whom few of any &s;ide mu&s;t tru&s;t.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter of Carmichael's regiment of dragoons is, in troops and
number of men, every way the &s;ame with Lothian's, 180.</P>
<P>This colonel, like his father, my lord Carmichael, now called earl
Hyndford, is con&s;idered as not well affected to the King's intere&s;t, and
his lieutenant colonel&mdash;Wi&s;hart far le&s;s; being a bigotted whig, the
&s;on of a mini&s;ter of that pernicious tribe. But Pollock of that ilk, the
major, though he is &s;omething whiggi&s;hly inclined, Kilmaronock tells me,
that he has often, with great a&s;&s;everations, &s;aid to him, that when the
King comes, he &s;hall have him and his troop; and this is all the loyalty
I know in this regiment, except one lieutenant Graham, who I know to
be well affected.</P>
<P>Three independent companies, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Highland thieves
and robbers; each company 100 men, 300.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t independent company is commanded by captain Campbell, of
Finnab; &s;uch as his chief, Argyle.</P>
<P>The &s;econd independent company, commanded by captain William
Grant; generally reputed loyal.</P>
<P>The third independent company, commanded by major M^cKenzie;
reputed loyal.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17">
The ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, commanded by earl of Leven, governor.
The garri&s;on, as I remember, con&s;i&s;ts of 100.</P>
<P>The governor's character is already given.</P>
<P>The lieutenant-governor, colonel James Stuart, one that was bred in
Dumbarton's regiment, and before and at the Revolution was e&s;teemed
very loyal, and is &s;till reputed to have loyal inclinations, but is a little
influenced by the duke of Queen&s;berry.</P>
<P>Major Cout, the lieutenant of the company, is a mo&s;t bigotted whig,
and reputed very di&s;loyal.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Stirling is commanded by the earl of Mar, governor.
The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of 100 men.</P>
<P>What to &s;ay of the governor I know not well. He was much re|puted
to have loyal inclinations; and to my certain knowledge, very
much courted by the earl of Arran, to be brought entirely in, both to
the intere&s;t of the King and country, and Arran once thought him&s;elf
&s;ure of him. But, la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, when the duke of Queen&s;|berry
came to Scotland, he no &s;ooner came, but he drew Mar from
the country party, with the bait of &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The lieutenant governor is colonel John Er&s;kine; one that is &s;uppo&s;ed
will always be for what the court has a mind to, &s;o long as he enjoys
any tolerable good po&s;t. But&mdash;Shaw, of Saughy, lieutenant of the
company, is reputed to have loyal inclinations.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Dumbarton is commanded by Ma&s;ter Archibald Camp|bell,
brother to Argyle. Who is the lieutenant, I know not; but the
garri&s;on, I think, con&s;i&s;ts of 60 men.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Blackne&s;s is commanded by the earl of Buchan, lately
made governor; and the garri&s;on, as I &s;uppo&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts of about 60
men; but who the lieutenant is, I know not.</P>
<P>The number of the whole forces, in field and garri&s;on, 2860.</P>
<P>This account of the forces is calculated according to the e&s;tabli&s;hment;
but cannot be reckoned effectually 2500, at the highe&s;t.</P>

<P>THE Whigs, by intimidating Godolphin, had procured the influ|ence
of government in the elections for members of the new par|liament,
which met, for the fir&s;t time, on the twenty-fifth of October,
1705. Finding them&s;elves the majority, John Smith, one of their own
party, was cho&s;en &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons, notwith&s;tanding the
vehement oppo&s;ition of the Tories. William Cowper, a man of heavy and
confu&s;ed parts, but who was attached to the &s;ame principles, was made, by
their influence, keeper of the great &s;eal; and in general, the whole cur|rent
of preferment ran through the &s;ame channel. The Tories, vexed at
the lo&s;s of their influence, acted a part which exhibited a curious &s;peci|men
of that glaring incon&s;i&s;tency of conduct, into which the &s;pirit of
party has too often betrayed mankind. To hara&s;s their political oppo|nents,
they endeavoured to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ground; and though
they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be enemies to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Han|nover,
the lord Haver&s;ham, as the mouth of the party, moved, in the
hou&s;e of lords, for an addre&s;s to the Queen, to invite the prince&s;s So|phia
into England. The motion was rejected by the Whigs, who then
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole influence of government. There were, however,
brought in two bills, which were deemed a great &s;ecurity to the prote|&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion: the fir&s;t, appointing a regency on the event of the
Queen's death; and the &s;econd for naturalizing the prince&s;s Sophia, and
the i&s;&s;ue of her body, being prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ition of the Whigs to the invitation to the prince&s;s Sophia,
having rai&s;ed &s;u&s;picions again&s;t their attachment to the hou&s;e of Hanno|ver,
the party endeavoured to take to them&s;elves the whole merit of the
<PB N="26" REF="39">
&s;ecurities in &s;avour of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which had pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ent
&s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. The lord Halifax, one of their number, was &s;ent
with the acts of regency and naturalization to Hannover; and he carried
along with him letters from all the leaders of the Whigs, expre&s;&s;ive of
their &s;incere attachment to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the electoral family. The
increa&s;e in the corre&s;pondence with Hannover, together with the zeal
expre&s;&s;ed in the letters, form a kind of proof that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
the prince&s;s Sophia and her po&s;terity, began then, for the fir&s;t time, to
acquire a degree of certainty. The Queen, perhaps ju&s;tly, was &s;u&s;pected
of having no intentions of that kind; and her mini&s;ter, the lord Godol|phin,
had been uniformly in the intere&s;t of the exiled family, though,
by a happy timidity, he at la&s;t, in a manner, en&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s to their
rivals. He, however, was &s;o true to his principles, that, though he
aided, with all the weight of government, the acts of regency and natu|ralization,
he never took merit to him&s;elf from that circum&s;tance, nor
entered into any corre&s;pondence with the hou&s;e of Hannover. The prin|cipal
events, connected with the corre&s;pondence of this year, are the
complimentary emba&s;&s;y of the lord Halifax, the treaty guaranteeing the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion concluded with the States General, the treaty of
Union then carrying on between the two kingdoms, the battle of Ramil|lies,
the &s;ub&s;equent conque&s;t of Flanders, the victory before Turin, and
the evacuation of Italy by the hou&s;e of Bourbon.</P>

<P>"THE dutche&s;s of Marlborough &s;hewed me a letter &s;he received
from Mrs. Howe, which appears to me to contain an affair of
&s;o much con&s;equence, that I think my&s;elf obliged, as a good Engli&s;h|man,
and as a faithful &s;ervant to your Electoral Highne&s;s, to commu|nicate
it to you. It contains, that all that has been done in England this
winter, for e&s;tabli&s;hing the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and for te&s;tifying re|&s;pect
and attentions to your electoral family, is, in the opinion of the
electre&s;s, of &s;o little con&s;equence, that &s;he con&s;iders it, at mo&s;t, as a
mere compliment; and that, for that rea&s;on, it will be more agreeable to
her, that the acts of parliament may be &s;ent to Hannover without any
ceremony, and that the garter which the Queen has given to the elec|toral
prince, may be &s;ent merely by a herald."</P>
<P>"The&s;e &s;entiments, concerning what hath been done here, are altogether
different from tho&s;e, which every one in England, who has ever &s;hewn
<PB N="30" REF="43">
any zeal for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, entertains of it. It is for this
rea&s;on, I am not able to reflect upon this affair, without a great
deal of unea&s;ine&s;s. The parliament have redre&s;&s;ed &s;everal very e&s;&s;ential
defects in the laws, which regarded a prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. They have
provided again&s;t all accidents which human prudence could fore&s;ee, and
they have put the government, in the time of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, on the &s;ame
footing which it is at pre&s;ent, during the reign of the Queen. The&s;e
things are con&s;idered here, as affairs of the la&s;t importance, and as the
mo&s;t real and e&s;&s;ential marks that could be given of a true zeal for the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"With regard to the act of naturalization of the electoral family, it has
been declared to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, by the unanimous opinion of all
the judges, who are the be&s;t guides in an affair of that nature. With re|gard
to the propo&s;al of inviting the electre&s;s over to England immedi|ately,
when it is con&s;idered, by what fort of men it was made, in what
manner, and at what time, there was rea&s;on to hope, that a propo&s;al of
that nature would not be better received by the electre&s;s, than it has
been in England. There is no one &s;o capable of judging of all this
affair, as your electoral Highne&s;s, and you only can &s;et it before the
electre&s;s in the proper light. This is what I be&s;eech you to be plea&s;ed
to do, for the good of England and of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. I can|not
make a better excu&s;e for the liberty I have taken, than the true zeal

<P>WHEN I was fir&s;t, by her Maje&s;ty's great goodne&s;s, rai&s;ed to the
&s;tation I am now in, I could not per&s;uade my&s;elf, that a &s;ubject
of &s;o little importance, would have then excu&s;ed my pre&s;umption in
troubling your electoral highne&s;s in this manner upon that occa&s;ion,
though with the &s;incere&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that my heart &s;hould ever continue
mo&s;t firmly devoted to the &s;ervice of your E. H. and your E. H. &s;e|rene
hou&s;e. But now, &s;ince I hope it is allowable for me, to expre&s;s to
your E. H. the very great &s;atisfaction I have with every good Engli&s;h|man,
received from the effectual &s;ecurities lately provided by the parlia|ment,
for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England; I beg leave
humbly to pre&s;ent to your E. H. at the &s;ame time, his mo&s;t faithful pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of a mo&s;t ardent zeal for your E. H. pro&s;perity, and promi&s;e
never to neglect any thing in my little power, that may po&s;&s;ibly conduce
to it; being fully per&s;uaded, it is impo&s;&s;ible to be in the true intere&s;t of
England and not to be a fa&s;t friend to that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which the &s;en&s;e of
the kingdom hath &s;o often declared to be its only defence from the mo&s;t
deplorable condition a people can be reduced to. I was one of tho&s;e,
who have had the honour, for a long time pa&s;t, con&s;tantly to have ad|hered
to that opinion, for excluding a Romi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or, even while it
was unfa&s;hionable and decried by tho&s;e that were in authority; and there|fore,
that the &s;ame per&s;ons &s;hould now continue firm to the &s;ame, when
it is owned by the legi&s;lative authority and the general bent of the peo|ple,
can admit, I think, of no que&s;tion. This I cho&s;e to mention, as an
evidence of my &s;incerity in what I profe&s;s, rather than multiply ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
which are in every one's power to make; not that I am at all
apprehen&s;ive of tho&s;e endeavours which have been u&s;ed to render your
E. H. and your E. H. &s;erene hou&s;e di&s;gu&s;ted, with tho&s;e who have the
true&s;t concern for your &s;ervice; &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;o excellent a
judgment as that of your E. H. &s;hould ever prefer the &s;urprizing &s;tarts of
a &s;udden unaccountable zeal, contrary to known principles, affected

<P>"THE hopes of having my letter pre&s;ented to your Electoral High|ne&s;s,
by my lord Halifax, has encouraged me to the pre&s;umption
of writing. I could not hope for a more favourable opportunity of mak|ing
this humble tender of my duty, than by the hands of one, who has
&s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, upon all occa&s;ions, for the &s;ettling and
e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown of England, in your mo&s;t &s;erene
family, and who will be a witne&s;s above exception, of my conduct, in
every part of that affair. I confe&s;s I always depended upon it, that my
public behaviour &s;hould be an abundant te&s;timony for me, as to my
zeal to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and for promoting the war, in order to
reduce the power of France, which I take to be the mo&s;t effectual &s;ecurity
to that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is with infinite &s;atisfaction we hear your Electoral Highne&s;s has been
plea&s;ed to approve the mea&s;ures taken in our parliament this la&s;t winter.
My lord Halifax is able to give &s;o perfect an account of every thing that
has been done, and of the &s;everal means u&s;ed to bring them all to bear,
that I &s;hall not pretend to enter further into that matter, than by &s;aying,
<PB N="34" REF="47">
I hope it will appear, that nothing is now wanting to the e&s;tabli&s;hment
of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that can be done by the provi&s;ion of laws; and that the
admini&s;tration of the government, when the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hall take place,
will be upon the &s;ame foot that it is now in the Queen's reign.</P>
<P>It might have a &s;trange appearance, that they, who by a long and
&s;teady &s;eries of acting, had &s;hown them&s;elves, beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of
di&s;pute, the a&s;&s;ertors of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in the per&s;on of her Electoral
Highne&s;s, the prince&s;s Sophia, &s;hould in the lea&s;t he&s;itate to agree to a
propo&s;ition, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to have the next pre&s;umptive heir to the
crown to re&s;ide in England; but I beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t to your Electoral
Highne&s;s's con&s;ideration, that if this had been allowed for a rule, it might
po&s;&s;ibly, in a little time, have pre&s;&s;ed very inconvenient upon your
Electoral Highne&s;s. It was not to be imagined you would leave domi|nions,
where you were &s;overeign, to re&s;ide in England, before you were
our king; and yet there would have been an inconveniency in rejecting
an invitation of that nature, when the kingdom had before declared &s;uch
a re&s;idence to be nece&s;&s;ary. But the manner of making this propo&s;al
was, above all other things, the &s;tronge&s;t objection to it. The &s;peech
with which it was introduced, is in print, and &s;o cannot be mi&s;repre|&s;ented.
The turn of it was to &s;hew fir&s;t, that we could go on no far|ther
with the Dutch, (which was in effect to &s;ay, we mu&s;t make peace)
and next to &s;ay, the Queen's admini&s;tration was hardly &s;ufficient to help
us in peace, at home, unle&s;s the next heir came over. The Queen was
pre&s;ent at this di&s;cour&s;e, and no one can judge &s;o well as your E. H.
whether this was a compliment proper to engage her Maje&s;ty, to enter
willingly into the invitation; and if it had been a&s;&s;ented to with reluc|tance,
whether it might not have given ri&s;e to unkindne&s;&s;es, that might
in the end have proved very fatal.</P>
<P>They who were afraid of entering into &s;uch an invitation, (e&s;pecially
coming as it did from tho&s;e, who never till then &s;hewed any concern for
the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion) thought it proper to lay hold of that favour|able
conjuncture, to pu&s;h in for tho&s;e &s;olid provi&s;ions, which were
evidently wanting, and which we hope are brought to effect, by the act
that is to be farther carried on by the negociation entered into for en|gaging
the allies to become guaranties of our &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and by the treaty
<PB N="35" REF="48">
between the commi&s;&s;ioners of England and Scotland, for a union of the
two kingdoms, which &s;eems to be the way now laid open, for obtaining
the declaration of the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in Scotland, which is already
effected in England. I believe there is a good di&s;po&s;ition in the com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
on both &s;ides. I can ab&s;olutely promi&s;e for one, the meane&s;t
of them, that as far as my capacity and application can go, nothing &s;hall
be wanting to bring this treaty to a happy i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Having already pre&s;umed to take &s;o great a liberty, I humbly beg
permi&s;&s;ion of your E. H. to mention another particular, the act of na|turalization,
which &s;ome have &s;aid was, at lea&s;t, unnece&s;&s;ary, if not a
diminution to your mo&s;t &s;erene family. If this be &s;o, not only all our
pre&s;ent judges, but all the lawyers of former ages have been in the wrong.
There are but two ways of making any per&s;ons born out of the allegi|ance
of the crown of England, capable of enjoying inheritances, honours,
or offices in this Kingdom; the one complete and perfect, which is a na|turalization,
by act of parliament; the other imperfect, which is by
letters patent, of denization. That this is &s;o, cannot be better proved, than
by the in&s;tance of his highne&s;s prince Rupert. For when K. C. the Fir&s;t
intended to create him D. of Cumberland, to make him capable of that
title, it was found nece&s;&s;ary, previou&s;ly to make him a denizen, by the K.'s
grant, under the great &s;eal; the differences then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the
King and his parliament, making it impo&s;&s;ible to procure a naturaliza|tion.
But the pre&s;ent act is attended with all po&s;&s;ible marks of honour
and re&s;pect, for the Queen and nation. It extends to all the po&s;terity of
her R. H. the prince&s;s Sophia, born, or hereafter to be born, and where|&s;oever
they are born, which is a privilege that was never yet granted
in any ca&s;e, till in this in&s;tance. It is only from your E. H.'s eminent
goodne&s;s, that I can hope for pardon, for this tedious addre&s;s. I am,
with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, &amp;c.</P>

for having employed her influence, in getting them pa&s;&s;ed. We are al&s;o
very &s;en&s;ible of the honour which &s;he does to the electoral prince, in
&s;ending him the order of the garter. As you know, that I am naturally
an enemy to ceremonies and compliments, you are undoubtedly per|&s;uaded,
that it is from that very motive I have wi&s;hed that Mr. How

which we &s;hall always employ, to cultivate the honour of her
friend&s;hip. I flatter my&s;elf, that it is too &s;olidly e&s;tabli&s;hed to &s;uffer
any diminution, from the di&s;cour&s;es attributed to the electre&s;s, which
&s;he certainly never held with Mrs. How; and which, having only come
to the ears of that lady, at &s;econd hand, have been undoubtedly related to
her in an unfaithful manner. I depend very much upon your af|fection,

the intendant of my finances, that is to &s;ay, the auditor of the
Exchequer, lord Halifax, has always te&s;tified for your per&s;on and your

have been formed; and, I doubt not, but you will agree with me, that
nothing could more effectually &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of your family. It
is with this view I have given them my a&s;&s;ent, having nothing in the

my &s;ubjects, by leaving the&s;e kingdoms to the mild dominion of my

a dignity, that my ance&s;tors always conferred upon tho&s;e whom they

The earne&s;tne&s;s of my above-mentioned mini&s;ter to obey my

<P>"I Am much obliged to you, for the letter of the 26th of March, (5th

I received, with the utmo&s;t gratitude, the communication of the de&s;ign

me. I judge it worthy of her Maje&s;ty's prudence, and of her zeal for

which will add a new lu&s;tre to the glory which you have already ac|quired,

for my own defence; and that the fear of that want has induced
me not to renew the treaty, but from year to year, and to &s;pecify the
places where my troops &s;hould act. I doubt not, but before you begin
the propo&s;ed march to Italy, you will take care to provide &s;ufficiently for

forces in the Low Countries, had pa&s;&s;ed the Geete at Tirlemont, and
encamped between that place and Leane, with a de&s;ign of giving us bat|tle,

in the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven and the valour of our troops. Sunday la&s;t, we

between the Mahain and the great Geete. We &s;oon under&s;tood that the
enemy were likewi&s;e in march; but, according to the report of the
general officers who were our pri&s;oners, their de&s;ign was not to fight
<PB N="46" REF="59">
before Monday; not believing that we would venture to come to them.
The armies were in fight before noon; and all diligence was u&s;ed on
both &s;ides to arrange the troops in order of battle, and to form the bat|teries,
which began to play at one. And toward two o'clock, we or|dered
the village of Ramillies, which covered the right of their infantry,
where they had their large&s;t battery, with a great force, to be attacked.</P>
<P>The battle became hot, and continued long enough, with great
fury; but at la&s;t, the enemy was obliged to give way. We took their
cannon, and made many pri&s;oners; and having continued the fight with
the &s;ame vigour, (the infantry as well as the cavalry) until between four
and five o'clock, when the enemy began to withdraw; we pur&s;ued them
without intermi&s;&s;ion, fighting them as they retired, until the night was
far advanced: &s;o that God has given us a complete victory. We have
taken forty-three pieces of cannon, the pontons, a great part of their
baggage, and at lea&s;t four thou&s;and pri&s;oners, be&s;ides their lo&s;s in the
battle.</P>
<P>We only halted two hours in the night, and we began our march
before day, in order to draw near the Dyle, of which we had determined
to attempt the pa&s;&s;age this morning at day-light: but the enemy &s;aved
us that trouble, having retired la&s;t night toward Bru&s;&s;els; &s;o that we
entered Louvain, and all our army pa&s;&s;ed the river without oppo&s;ition.

<P>"I Thought it proper to inform you, by a me&s;&s;enger, that the prince
of Baden continues to &s;olicit lieutenant general Bulau to march to
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with the corps of troops which I have in the Queen's &s;er|vice.
He wrote to him from Ra&s;tadt, the 19th in&s;tant, by Mr. D'Ave|nant,
the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing letter imaginable. It is true, I had permitted
the lieutenant general to advance, on that &s;ide, with my troops, when
there was any hopes of preventing the enemy from executing their pro|ject
on the Upper Rhine. But, at pre&s;ent, where they have carried their
point, when the Mar&s;hal de Mar&s;in returns to the Mae&s;e with the detach|ment
which he commands, and when the prince of Baden, having placed
him&s;elf &s;afely beyond the Rhine, has a&s;&s;embled there a force &s;ufficient to
prevent the pa&s;&s;age of the French, I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending to him
my troops. I know, if they once &s;hould advance on that &s;ide, the prince
will find means of keeping them all the campaign, which is as contrary to
my intentions as it is to the public &s;ervice. I always reckoned that they
were to &s;erve in your army; and I don't &s;ee that there is any nece&s;&s;ity of
employing them el&s;ewhere. You will therefore oblige me much, by
&s;ending them your orders without delay. They will follow them punc|tually.
But I chu&s;e to hope, that you will approve the &s;trong rea&s;ons
which I have, not to tru&s;t them to the prince of Baden; and that the
intere&s;t of the common cau&s;e does not demand that I &s;hould. You will find
means of employing my troops in places where they may &s;erve more u&s;e|fully.
I &s;hall never think them &s;o well as under your orders; and I
&s;hall never be &s;o well &s;atisfied, as when they &s;erve in a manner which
will procure them your approbation. I am, very &s;incerely, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"I Received the letter which your E. H. did me the honour of writing
to me the 26th of the la&s;t month; and I was informed, from other
quarters, of the earne&s;t repre&s;entations which the prince of Baden conti|nued
to make to Mon&s;ide Bulau, in order to engage him to march to
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But there are more than ten days, &s;ince I &s;ent po&s;itive
orders to that general to come, with all &s;peed, to the Low Countries;
which he will undoubtedly communicate to your E. H. I am very glad
to &s;ee, by this letter, that what I have done in this re&s;pect, is agreeable
to the wi&s;hes of your E. H. I expect to learn, every moment, that the
troops are on their march, having &s;ent to them a route to come from Co|blentz
to Liege.</P>
<P>The prince of Baden &s;hould adhere to his orders, &s;ince, as your F.
H. remarks, he has troops under his command of which he makes no
<PB N="49" REF="62">
u&s;e. But as, according to the intelligence which we receive, the court
of France mu&s;t have given orders to Mon&s;ieur de Villars to march thirty
battalions and forty &s;quadrons to this &s;ide, the prince will be &s;oon at
liberty to act on his &s;ide: and I &s;latter my&s;elf that the court of Vienna
will take care, that &s;o large a body of troops, Mon&s;ieur de Bulau com|puting
them at forty thou&s;and men, be&s;ides the He&s;&s;ians, &s;hall not remain
inactive during the campaign.</P>
<P>I did my&s;elf the honour to communicate to your E. H. on the
25th of the la&s;t month, the victory which we obtained over the enemy.
We have not failed to pur&s;ue our blow; and the happy con&s;equences
which that has produced, are beyond whatever we could hope. It has
never been heard, that &s;o many places of &s;trength, with entire provinces,
&s;urrendered in &s;o &s;hort a time, e&s;pecially as they were provided with garri|&s;ons
and magazines for a good defence. Oudenard, where there were
three battalions, &s;urrendered ye&s;terday. I have ordered Antwerp and
Oftend to be &s;ummoned, and I expect their an&s;wers every moment. We
cannot take the proper mea&s;ures, until we are ma&s;ters of the fir&s;t place.
I flatter my&s;elf that all this will have a good effect el&s;ewhere; and that if
our troops upon the Upper Rhine will do their duty properly, the enemy
will be even obliged to bring forces from Italy to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; which
will give relief to the duke of Savoy and prince Eugene, and may fru&s;|trate
the de&s;igns of the enemy upon Turin. I am, with a mo&s;t profound

<P>"I Found my&s;elf &s;o very de&s;irous of embracing the opportunity of the

to the treaty. I &s;end now a copy of it to your Electoral Highne&s;s, in
order that I may have the honour of receiving &s;uch remarks or in&s;truc|tions,
as your Electoral Highne&s;s will think proper to communicate to
me, on the &s;ubject. Your Electoral Highne&s;s will find the guarantee of
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion drawn up nearly in the &s;ame terms, as I mentioned in my
la&s;t letter. But their demands, with regard to the barrier, which they
wi&s;h to have, are &s;o extravagant, that I doubt whether they will be con|&s;ented
to, as they have projected them. I repre&s;ented this very amply to
the mini&s;ters in Holland; and it appears to me, that they have made this
propo&s;al concerning a barrier, altogether like merchants. They know
very well, that their demands are exorbitant; but they hope to obtain
the better bargain, by lowering a great deal of their preten&s;ions. The
pen&s;ionary is &s;o convinced of this, that he entreated me to &s;end him, in
writing, the objections which I made to them. I will not fail to do &s;o.
Although this method of acting is not ju&s;t, for it will greatly retard the
conclu&s;ion of the treaty. Several efforts have been made from many
places, for breaking off this negociation. But I hope that we &s;hall &s;ur|mount
all the&s;e ob&s;tacles.</P>
<P>We have all the rea&s;on to promi&s;e our&s;elves &s;ucce&s;s, in our union

<PB N="62" REF="75">
and there &s;hall be no further means of preventing it, certain gentlemen
in Holland, will not &s;how &s;o much coldne&s;s for the treaty of guarantee.</P>
<P>I gave an account to the Queen, of the favourable reception which
I met with in Hannover; and her Maje&s;ty is extremely &s;atisfied with
the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, which your Electoral Highne&s;s te&s;tified for
her. She has commanded me to renew all the a&s;&s;urances which I gave to
your Electoral Highne&s;s, that &s;he will do every thing in her power, for
advancing the intere&s;ts of your Electoral Highne&s;s, and of your family;
and I believe you will receive, very &s;oon, &s;ome fre&s;h marks of her zeal

that I did not neglect to give you an account of this negociation, as well
as of the manner in which the Queen received it, upon my return from
the court of your Electoral Highne&s;s. Since that time, I had occa&s;ion to
know the &s;entiments of others, on the propo&s;al, concerning the barrier;
and every one agrees, that nothing can be more extravagant than &s;uch a
demand. I delayed to write to the pen&s;ionary, not knowing but I ought
fir&s;t to receive the in&s;tructions of your Electoral Highne&s;s upon the

too openly again&s;t their extravagant hopes. It is certain, that France
has made them as advantageous offers, as they propo&s;e; which makes it
the more delicate and difficult to tell them, that we believe they them|&s;elves
propo&s;e too much. I can tell your Electoral Highne&s;s, that the
Queen's mini&s;ters have acted as wi&s;e men and men of honour, with re|gard
to the offers of France for a peace. They plainly declared to the
Dutch, on what terms they could con&s;ent to it, which are &s;uch as can|not
fail to &s;atisfy all the allies: and they in&s;i&s;ted particularly, that we
could never believe, that it was honourable to treat of a peace, while one
who pretended to be King of England, remained in France. I am, with
a profound re&s;pect, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"I Received the letter which you was at the trouble of writing to me,
concerning the entry of the King of Sweden into Saxony. You
will undoubtedly know already, that that prince has declared, at Berlin and
el&s;ewere, that his de&s;ign was not to di&s;turb the Empire, nor to cau&s;e any
prejudice to the allies: and as it appears certain, that he has no treaty
with the King of France, there is rea&s;on to hope, that he will not go

no diffidence of that prince, and to take no mea&s;ures again&s;t him;
for that would be the means of hurrying him into engagements with
France, and into de&s;igns again&s;t the empire; of which, there is rea&s;on to

<P>As for my part, I &s;hall &s;pare neither care nor pains, to appea&s;e the trou|bles

<P>"I Have received the honour of your Royal Highne&s;s's letter of the
12th, and am extremely plea&s;ed, that my zeal to &s;erve your
Highne&s;s and your family, has been &s;o well received; and I &s;hall make
it the bu&s;ine&s;s of my life to merit the continuance of your fa|vour.
The patent for the title of the electoral prince, is now di&s;patched.
We were a great while looking for titles, that were anciently in the royal
family, for the earldom and the marqui&s;ate; but mo&s;t of the old titles
have been &s;ince given away, e&s;pecially to the natural &s;ons of King Charles;
and at la&s;t, it was thought be&s;t, to create him Marquis and Duke of
Cambridge, that if your Royal Highne&s;s and the Elector plea&s;e, the young
prince, when he &s;hall be born<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His lord&s;hip, it &s;eems, was determined, that the unborn child &s;hould be a boy.</NOTE> may be called marquis of Cambridge.
The duke of York his &s;ons were called &s;o, when he was nearer in degree
to the crown, and it would certainly plea&s;e the Engli&s;h, if he took that
name. I &s;end your Royal Highne&s;s the articles of the Union, as they
are printed in Scotland. They have been kept very private, till they
were laid before the parliament; by all accounts from thence, there is
great rea&s;on to hope they will be approved; there has been little done
hitherto, but the appearances are promi&s;ing; the Jacobites there, are &s;o
apprehen&s;ive that the Union will be carried, that they are willing to come
into the propo&s;ition which the oppo&s;ing party talk of making, which is,
to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on your Royal Highne&s;s, with limitations, and a
communication of trade; they think this the mo&s;t plau&s;ible way of baf|fling
the union; but it is &s;o well under&s;tood, that this offer comes too
late now, which might willingly have been received &s;ome months ago.
But your Royal Highne&s;s will give me leave to ob&s;erve, that we have
managed the opportunities we have had with &s;ome &s;kill, when things are
brought to that pa&s;s, that the very Jacobites are for &s;ettling the prote&s;|tant
<PB N="69" REF="84">
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion one way, to avoid e&s;tabli&s;hing it more effectually another.
And we have this further to &s;ay, that, if this Union is made, it will be
the fir&s;t in&s;tance in hi&s;tory of this kind; for there never was, at any time
or in any place, an example of two &s;overeign kingdoms incorporating
them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner."</P>

which I hope you will give to Mon&s;. Lubieres; 'tis a pretty

tell you, very confidently, that the Union will be agreed to in Scotland;
we have letters from thence, of the 14th, which &s;ay, that the oppo&s;ing
party have made their effort two ways; they would fir&s;t have put off the
con&s;ideration of it for three months, that they might con&s;ult their con&s;ti|tuents;
but that was carried again&s;t them, by a great majority: then
they propo&s;ed a general fa&s;t, which would have taken up three weeks,
but that was waved, becau&s;e the A&s;&s;embly of the kirk had not a&s;ked it;
and when it was moved there, it was rejected, and the a&s;&s;embly has di|rected
the mini&s;ters to offer up prayers for the &s;ucce&s;s of the union. And
now the clergy have made this &s;tep, it cannot fail of &s;ucceeding. By
letters I have from Holland, I have no doubt of the &s;ucce&s;s of our treaty
there, though there will be &s;ome difficulty in adju&s;ting their barrier. I
think now, we may be all allowed to boa&s;t, that nothing was ever better
pu&s;hed, than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our &s;ucce&s;&s;ion has been, &s;ince we had a

whom France has made no overture; and, as the two letters which you

<P>THOUGH Great Britain derived the benefits of the Revolution
from the folly and enthu&s;ia&s;m of James the Second, it owed the
continuance of that &s;y&s;tem of government to the happy ignorance and
confined policy of Lewis the Fourteenth. The ju&s;tne&s;s of this ob&s;erva|tion
is partly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;ecret negociations of the pre&s;ent year.
The Union of the kingdoms had rai&s;ed a re&s;entment, and even a degree
of fury, among the nobility and gentry, as well as among the vulgar in
Scotland, that threatened the wor&s;t con&s;equences. They wanted but a
&s;how of &s;uccours from France, to take up arms again&s;t England. Many
of the nobility and chiefs of clans were enthu&s;ia&s;tically attached to the
excluded family; and they pre&s;&s;ed, with eagerne&s;s, for the pre&s;ence of
the Pretender in Scotland, were it only with a body of men &s;ufficient to
protect him again&s;t the officers of ju&s;tice in the kingdom, till they could
join him with their va&s;&s;als. The French King, though apprized of this
&s;tate of affairs in Scotland, either through want of comprehen&s;ion in
him&s;elf, or the fortunate ignorance of foreign affairs, which always pre|vailed
in the coun&s;els of France, declined to &s;end the demanded &s;upplies,
and thus di&s;couraged a diver&s;ion to the arms of the mo&s;t powerful of the
allies, which, in all likelihood, would have procured the peace which was
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>To amu&s;e, however, the Scots, he re&s;olved to &s;end colonel Hooke
again into their country. The object of this man's expedition was to
induce the malecontents to take arms, without &s;ubjecting the French
King to any engagements on his &s;ide. When Hooke arrived in Scot|land,
he found the malecontents di&s;tracted among them&s;elves. The
duke of Hamilton, who had been for many years con&s;idered as the head
<PB N="75" REF="90">
of the Jacobites,<MILESTONE N="January." UNIT="month"> and was much followed by the Pre&s;byterians, had lo&s;t
the affection and confidence of both, by his impenetrable conduct in par|liament.
The two parties were equally aver&s;e to the Union; and they
a&s;cribed the misfortune, as they called it, of that mea&s;ure, either to the
timidity or treachery of the duke. In this &s;tate of affairs, it was not
likely that, if even France had &s;ent the aid required, the enemies of the
Union could make any formidable figure in the field. But the court of
St. Germains, who perceived that there was no &s;erious intention to favour
their own cau&s;e, informed their friends in Scotland, that no &s;uccours
were to be &s;ent; and that, therefore, they ought to take care of them|&s;elves.
The chief part of the corre&s;pondence of the pre&s;ent year relates
to the&s;e circum&s;tances. The &s;ervants of the Pretender, who had been
unrea&s;onably &s;anguine on many other occa&s;ions, &s;eemed to have derived
no hopes, either from Hooke's negociations, or the intrigues of their agents
in England, with the duke of Marlborough and the earl of Godolphin.
They, however, continued their intercour&s;e with the Jacobites in Bri|tain,
to pre&s;erve them in their principles and hopes, for a more favour|able
conjuncture.</P>

<P>"I Find no ground at all for the reports you mention, of the mer|chants
Manly [the King] and Wi&s;ely's [Queen] removing from the
place, where they have &s;o long traded, and fixing el&s;ewhere; &s;o that I
look upon &s;uch rumours, whether well or ill meant, to be but idle &s;pe|culations.
I am al&s;o of your opinion, that a good con&s;truction may po&s;|&s;ibly
be made of Arm&s;worth's [Marlborough's] intentions in the bargain
which is now making between Wheatly [England] and Norly [Scotland],
becau&s;e it may bring on a nece&s;&s;ity of Henly's continuing in his po&s;t;
for it has always been my opinion, that Arm&s;worth [Marlborough] with|out
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Henly would never be able to pay his old debts.
But on the other hand, I very much que&s;tion whether at this pre&s;ent that
merchant and his partners have &s;uch hone&s;t thoughts. I am very appre|hen&s;ive
that he intends only to &s;upport him&s;elf, in &s;upporting Henly,
and little thinks of his former engagements. But the&s;e matters mu&s;t be
left to time and to providence."</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 27.</NOTE>&mdash;"As to what you writ concerning tho&s;e two merchants, Goul&s;ton
[Godolphin] and Arm&s;worth [Marlborough], they are &s;o full of my&s;tery
in their dealings, that it is hard to judge of their intentions and de&s;igns."</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="February." UNIT="month"> The Jacobites have generally, and with &s;ome rea&s;on, &s;u&s;pected, that
the court of France regarded no further the intere&s;t of the Pretender,
than only when it was &s;ub&s;ervient to their own. Lewis the Fourteenth
him&s;elf &s;eems frequently to have been &s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ions to the ex|cluded
family. His mini&s;ters, however, ju&s;tly judging that they could
have only the uncertain gratitude of the per&s;on whom they &s;hould &s;erve
for the expence and hazard of an expedition, were extremely backward in
making any effectual efforts for invading Britain. Be&s;ides, it was natural
for them, con&s;idering their own attachment to monarchy, to &s;uppo&s;e,
that they derived great advantage from having in their hands the per&s;on
whom they &s;uppo&s;ed to have an hereditary right to the Briti&s;h crown.
The attempts, therefore, which were, from time to time, made for in|vading
this i&s;land, were rather intended to engage the nation in a civil
war, than to contribute effectually to re&s;tore the family of Stuart. The
languor and caution of its court increa&s;ed with the misfortunes of France
in the pre&s;ent war. Happily for Britain, the court of Ver&s;ailles were
mo&s;t inattentive and negligent, when they mo&s;t &s;tood in need of &s;pirited
efforts, and when the &s;tate of the&s;e kingdoms were mo&s;t expo&s;ed to re|volution
and change. It was, for example, with great caution and re|luctancy,
as appears from the following letters, that the French mini&s;try
yielded to the vehement applications of the court of St. Germains, to
take advantage of the violent di&s;contents excited in Scotland, in the pre|&s;ent
year, by the Union between the kingdoms.</P>

liberties, and independency.</P>
<P>5. If you find that a party is di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;e in arms, on what pre|tence
what&s;oever, without directly owning our authority, you are to ac|quaint
our friends, that we allow and approve of their joining with, and
a&s;&s;i&s;ting them again&s;t our common enemy.</P>
<P>6. Our commi&s;&s;ion of general is de&s;igned for the earl of Arran; but in
ca&s;e he declines it, our friends are to name another, who&s;e name is to be
in&s;erted. But neither this commi&s;&s;ion, nor that for levying of war, either
in Scotland or Ireland, to be publi&s;hed, except you find them immedi|ately
di&s;po&s;ed to take the field; though our letter to him in Ireland may
be &s;ent, when it can be &s;afely conveyed.</P>
<P>7. You are to a&s;&s;ure each of our friends, in particular, of the true
&s;en&s;e we have of his loyalty, and &s;ufferings on that account, which we
think our&s;elves bound, in honour and intere&s;t, to reward to the utmo&s;t

he is irreconcilable with our chief adver&s;ary Wanly [the Whigs]; and
that you may perhaps make him firm to us; and it is upon a like account
that we may reckon to have friends in Mr. Norly's [Scotland] family,
who can never pardon what our adver&s;ary Brag [parliament] has done

<P>I perceive there are great animo&s;ities between the&s;e two merchants,

to a recognition of King Stani&s;laus, and charge them&s;elves with the gua|rantee
of the peace of Saxony, without exacting any condition or decla|ration
from the King of Sweden: and that, on the other hand, an end is
put to the affair of the renunciation of prince Charles, and mini&s;ters
are &s;ent to Hamburgh to regulate there, what is &s;till wanting to the

may be offered to the fir&s;t, and of 1000l. to the &s;econd; of which the

that, by the li&s;ts which the Elector of Metz and the Elector Palatine
communicated to me, of the &s;tate of the army, and of the reinforcements
which it may receive, it appears, that there will be nearly a &s;ufficient

The reinforcement is &s;o much the more indi&s;pen&s;able, that it is certain,
that the cavalry which King Augu&s;tus offers, is not in a condition to
&s;erve this campaign, and that there are no more cavalry remaining in
Germany which one can employ. I &s;hall be very particularly obliged
to you for this; and I entreat you to be per&s;uaded, that if I undertake

<P>THE attempt made towards an inva&s;ion of Scotland, in the begin|ning
of the pre&s;ent year, &s;eems to have been, in a manner, ex|torted
from the French mini&s;try, by the repeated and earne&s;t &s;olicitations
of the court of St. Germains. A&s;cribing the flattering accounts, received
from Scotland, to the zeal of the Jacobites in France, they were un|willing
to hazard either their &s;hips or their troops upon &s;o &s;lender a foun|dation.
The di&s;contents, in Scotland, though, perhaps, not magnified
beyond their real bounds, were repre&s;ented as too great to be implicitly
believed. This caution, on the part of France, has been, upon many
occa&s;ions, highly fortunate for Great Britain; but at no period more for|tunate,
than in the year 1708. Towards the beginning of February,
M. de Chamillart and his brethren in office began to i&s;&s;ue orders, for an
expedition from Dunkirk. The Pretender, when he perceived, that
&s;omething &s;erious was intended in his favour, re&s;olved to acquaint his
friends in Scotland, of the intentions of the court of France, and to give
them directions to prepare them&s;elves for an in&s;urrection. The per&s;on
appointed for this &s;ervice, was Charles Fleming, brother to the earl of
Wigton. The following were the in&s;tructions given him upon this oc|ca&s;ion.</P>

being a critical time which ought not to be neglected.</P>

tran&s;ported with &s;ecurity. In the mean time, we will &s;tay in the High|lands,
unle&s;s we be invited and encouraged by our friends in the Low|lands,
to go to them.</P>

&s;end back this bearer, well informed of their opinion concerning
it; as al&s;o with an account of the &s;tate of the nation, of what troops are
in it, of what country, and how inclined, and what number of men they
can bring into the field for us.</P>

of Inverlochy, and that they would inform us of the fitte&s;t place in the
Highlands for our landing, and &s;end along with the bearer two or more
able pilots, who know the&s;e places and can conduct us into them.</P>
<P>7thly, And, in ca&s;e they prove in&s;trumental to our re&s;toration, by
doing what is here propo&s;ed to them, we promi&s;e to give them particu|lar
and e&s;&s;ential marks of our kindne&s;s, and of the &s;en&s;e we have of all

<P><MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="year"> THE violent Jacobites in Scotland complained, without rea&s;on, that
they were de&s;erted by the prince whom they called to the throne.
The Pretender was not his own ma&s;ter, when he was carried to the coa&s;t
of Britain, in a French bottom. He had, with tears in his eyes, &s;olicited
M. de Fourbir, to land him on the coa&s;t of North Britain, were it even
with his dome&s;tics only. But it &s;eems, that the French admiral had re|ceived
&s;ecret orders, not to permit the Pretender to &s;lip from his hands,
though it is difficult to &s;ay what u&s;e the court of Ver&s;ailles could make
of that unfortunate prince, except the making a diver&s;ion, for a few
months, to the Briti&s;h arms. When the pretended prince returned to
France, he accompanied the duke of Burgundy into Flanders, and &s;erved
the campaign. The di&s;contented Scots continued their &s;olicitations to
the per&s;on whom they called their King, and he and his &s;ervants were
equally earne&s;t with the court of Ver&s;ailles, to prepare another expe|dition
into North Britain.</P>
<P>Lewis, for &s;ome time, li&s;tened with attention to the repre&s;entations of
the Pretender. But a winter uncommonly &s;evere, which de&s;troyed the
fruits of the earth, added the misfortune of famine to the numerous di&s;|tre&s;&s;es
brought on his people by the war. He, therefore, plainly told
the Pretender, that he was &s;o far from being in a condition to invade the
territories of his enemies, that he was afraid he could not defend his own.
The di&s;contented Scots were &s;trangers to the low &s;tate of France; and
they endeavoured, as in the following &s;tate of the Highland clans, to in|duce
Lewis the Fourteenth to &s;end aid, by repre&s;enting their own power.
Nothing in the paper appears to have been exaggerated, though its mani|fe&s;t
de&s;ign was to encourage a French inva&s;ion.</P>

may bring to the field for the King's &s;ervice."</HEAD>
<P>"THE Highlanders are u&s;ed to arms from their infancy, and may
be reckoned as good as their equal number of the be&s;t regular
troops in Europe; and they have, on all occa&s;ions, (particularly under
the command of the marquis of Montro&s;e for King Charles the Fir&s;t,
and the vi&s;count of Dundee for King James the Seventh) in &s;everal
battles defeated above double their number of old regular troops; and
it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain their charge, if they be rightly led on;
they being &s;uperior both in their arms and manner of fighting to any
other troops.</P>
<P>The clans are here mentioned, with five hundred men to a regiment.
It is true, that &s;ome of them can bring more men to the field, and others
fewer; but, computing them one with another, they may be reckoned &s;o.</P>
<P>The three great branches of the M^cDonalds, viz.</P>
<P>CLANRANALD.&mdash;GLENGARIE.&mdash;Sir DONALD M^cDONALD of Sleat.</P>
<P>The captains of Clanranald's family have &s;till been loyal, and had a
good regiment in the fields for King Charles I. and II. and this pre&s;ent
captain, at fourteen years of age, was, with 500 men, at the battle of
Killicranky for King James VII. This family has &s;uffered much for
their loyalty, by the oppre&s;&s;ions of the family of Argyle, who have been
rebels for four generations by-pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Clanranald's family and their followers are Catholics.</P>
<P>Glengarie his predece&s;&s;or, the late lord M^cDonald, had &s;till a regiment

the &s;ame for King James VII.</P>
<P>This family has &s;uffered much al&s;o by the family of Argyle. Both he
and his followers are Catholics.</P>
<P>Sir Donald M^cDonald of Sleat was with his regiment at the battle of

<P>The&s;e three branches of the M^cDonalds, including other le&s;&s;er branches
of that name, may bring to the field, of very good men, 1500.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="133">
The three great branches of M^cDu&s;&s; or Clanchattan, viz.</P>
<P>FARQUHARSONS.&mdash;M^cINTOSHES.&mdash;M^cPHERSONS.</P>
<P>The Farquhar&s;ons have &s;till been loyal: for Findlay Farquhar&s;on of
Braemar and Inverey was killed carrying the royal banner at the battle
of Pinkie, in the year 1547, again&s;t the Engli&s;h. His grand-child,
James Farquhar&s;on of Inverey was, at 70 years of age, kept two years
pri&s;oner at Edinburgh for his loyalty; and was forced to pay a con&s;ider|able
fine before he was relea&s;ed. His &s;on, colonel William Farquhar&s;on
of Inverey, had &s;till a good regiment for the &s;ervice of King Charles I.
and II. under the command of the marqui&s;es of Huntley and Montro&s;e,
and the earls of Glencairn and Middleton; and being &s;till without pay,
and at his own charges, mortgaged all his e&s;tate for the &s;aid &s;ervice, worth
about 500<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling a-year. Yet his &s;on, colonel John Farquhar&s;on of
Inverey, was among the fir&s;t who took arms for King James VII.; and
after all the other Highlanders had given over coming to the field, he
rai&s;ed betwixt eight and nine hundred men, and &s;u&s;tained the &s;mall party
of the King's officers a whole campaign, acting offen&s;ively as well as de|fen&s;ive;
for which he had &s;ix pari&s;hes (belonging to him and his re|lations)
entirely burnt and de&s;troyed, which was procured by the lord
Forbes and his family; one of the mo&s;t rebellious in Scotland, and their
next neighbours. Witne&s;&s;es of their la&s;t &s;ervices and &s;ufferings are co|lonel
Rattrey, major Holmes, lieutenant colonel Fitz&s;imons, and &s;everal
others pre&s;ent in France. Many of the name of Farquhar&s;on and their
followers are Catholics.</P>
<P>The M^cInto&s;hes and M^cPher&s;ons, although they did not ri&s;e to arms
all of them, yet they &s;till &s;ent men to the field, both for the &s;ervices
of Kings Charles I. and II. and for King James VII.; and are all of
them at pre&s;ent loyal. The&s;e three fore-mentioned branches, including
others le&s;&s;er about them, can bring to the field, of very good men, 1500.</P>
<P>The M^cLeans have &s;till been loyal; their chief and 500 of his name
being killed at Inverkething, for King Charles II. by Cromwell. They
have been al&s;o in the field for King Charles I. and they had, at the battle
of Killicranky, for King James VII. five hundred men, and will be found
very ready, when the King &s;hall have u&s;e for them. They are mightily

<P>The Stuarts and Robert&s;ons of Athol have &s;till been loyal, and have &s;till
taken the field for the Kings Charles I. and II. and for King James VII.
notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent marquis of Athol who was &s;uperior to the
mo&s;t part of them, was then for the prince of Orange; but it is now the

They may bring to the field, of very good men, 500.</P>
<P>The M^cKenzies are neither to be doubted; &s;ince they will follow their

<P>The Fra&s;ers are loyally inclined; and may bring to the field, of very

<P>The M^cLeods are loyally inclined; and may bring to the field, of

<P>The Sinclairs are e&s;teemed loyal; and may bring to the field, of in|different

<P>The M^cKays and the Highlanders of Strathnaver; their &s;uperiors are
not loyal; yet their commons can be brought to the field, and may do
good &s;ervice, being joined with others; they may make, of very good

<P>The Ro&s;&s;es of Balnagowan; their chief is not loyal, yet his clan
might be brought to the field; and they may make, of none of the

<P>The Grants; their chief has been very violent again&s;t the late King,
and rai&s;ed a regiment again&s;t him, and entertained it three years at his
own charges; yet his clan mu&s;t be called to the field, and joined to
<PB N="120" REF="135">
others of unque&s;tioned loyalty. They may rai&s;e, of none of the be&s;t of
men, 500.</P>
<P>The Campbells of Breadalbin; their &s;uperior, the earl of Breadalbin,
is a very cunning man; yet &s;till pretends to be very loyal. They may
bring to the field, of indifferent good men, 500.</P>
<P>The Grahams of Menteeth and Stuarts of Down are loyal; and may
bring to the field, of very good men, 500.</P>
<P>The M^cNeils of Galchyle, M^cLauchlans, M^cKinnons, M^cAulays,
M^cNabs, M^cGregors, M^cGibbons, M^cEchins of Dumbarton; Argyle

all, of very good men, 1000.</P>
<P>The number of all the men is 12,000.</P>
<P>That which is commonly objected again&s;t the Highlanders is, that
they do not keep di&s;cipline, and that they plunder.</P>
<P>To which it may be ea&s;ily an&s;wered, that at all the times the Highlanders
were in the fields, they neither had pay nor provi&s;ions, but what Provi|dence
&s;ent them from day to day; and each &s;oldier being obliged to go
and &s;earch for him&s;elf, it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;end an officer with each of
them: &s;o abu&s;es could not be prevented; and, were the mo&s;t regular

<P>Mo&s;t part of all Lowlanders are their inveterate enemies, and &s;eldom

&s;ome of their fir&s;t nobility; and, as to their le&s;&s;er, a dozen and more of
them cannot bring &s;o many men to the field as one clan.</P>
<P>The King might likewi&s;e expect from the low countries of Scotland,
at lea&s;t, 20,000 men; for the King hath generally, all the nation over,
three for him, for one again&s;t him. But &s;uppo&s;ing he hath but half,
as certainly he hath more, the militia of Scotland being 22,000 men,
that half has but to double their militia, which they may ea&s;ily do, will
make above 20,000 men. But the King mu&s;t carry arms for them.</P>

<P>"THE King of Great Britain has been very &s;en&s;ibly chagrined that
his friends in Scotland have been kept &s;o long in &s;u&s;pence, con|cerning
a &s;econd expedition into that country; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to
come to any certain determination about it &s;ooner, although the affair
was pre&s;&s;ed with all po&s;&s;ible earne&s;tne&s;s. At la&s;t, his Maje&s;ty has re|ceived,
within a few days, a deci&s;ive an&s;wer, and he commands me to
communicate it to you from him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall tell you then, that the project of a &s;econd expedition into Scot|land
has been propo&s;ed to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, in a very ample
memorial, in which nothing was omitted to engage him to enter into the
&s;cheme, and to convince him, that the enterpri&s;e was as much for his
intere&s;t as for the intere&s;t of his Britannic Maje&s;ty. That his mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian
Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to enter very cordially into the affair when
it was propo&s;ed to him; and that he has taken time to con&s;ider the pro|ject,
and has te&s;tified a &s;incere de&s;ire to make every effort for putting it
in execution: but, after having duly weighed all things, and con&s;idered
the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of his affairs, his la&s;t an&s;wer has been, that, in the
pre&s;ent conjuncture, the thing was not practicable, con&s;idering that it
was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for him, at this time, to furni&s;h all that was
nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an expedition.</P>
<P>It is his Britannic Maje&s;ty's de&s;ire that you communicate this to all the
well-affected in Scotland, in order that they may take their mea&s;ures to
pre&s;erve them&s;elves to a more favourable time. The King did not de|mand
of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty but 8000 men, with money, arms,
and ammunition in proportion. But that could neither be granted nor
tran&s;ported, with &s;afety, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the affairs of France.
When they are in a better &s;ituation, I hope the King of Great Britain
will feel the effects of it. But whatever may happen, he is determined
never to di&s;continue his efforts for the recovery of his dominions; and,
I doubt not, but &s;oon or late he will &s;ucceed, although it is not ea&s;y to
fore&s;ee either the time or the manner. In the mean time, he recommends
to all his loyal &s;ubjects to take as much care as they can of their own
pre&s;ervation. Every one knows the &s;tate of his own affairs, and what is
<PB N="122" REF="137">
mo&s;t &s;uitable for him to do for his own &s;afety in this conjuncture; there|fore,
in that re&s;pect, there are no rules to be pre&s;cribed to them. But
his Maje&s;ty always depends upon the continuance of their loyalty; and
he is thoroughly per&s;uaded, that he will always find them well di&s;po&s;ed
to give him proofs of their zeal and affection, every time he &s;hall have
occa&s;ion for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance."</P>

<P>The States General having informed the courts of Vienna and Great
Britain, that the pre&s;ident Rouill&egrave; was come to them from France,
with general offers of peace, prince Eugene and the duke of Marlbo|rough
were &s;ent, by their re&s;pective courts, to the Hague, in the begin|ning
of April, 1709. To the&s;e generals, who were buoyed up with the
hopes of penetrating into France the next campaign, the overtures made
on the part of Lewis XIV. &s;eemed not to be &s;atisfactory; and the duke
of Marlborough came back to London on the 17th of April. His pro|&s;e&s;&s;ed

In all the conferences held to &s;ettle the preliminaries of peace, it was de|manded

<P>"I HAVE the honour to &s;end you a memorial concerning the in|tere&s;ts
of the King, my ma&s;ter; and I hope you will approve of
the method which I have taken, of in&s;erting nothing in it but what might
&s;erve for an in&s;truction to your negociator, in ca&s;e the King approves it,
<PB N="123" REF="138">
re&s;erving to my&s;elf to explain to you here the &s;entiments of the King of
England, becau&s;e that mixture might occa&s;ion &s;ome confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Although France is the only country in which his Britannic Maje&s;ty
can find any con&s;olation, out of his own country, yet, &s;ince the enemy
in&s;i&s;t upon his leaving it, he a&s;ks the King's permi&s;&s;ion to do &s;o, as the
only means of giving him a te&s;timony of his gratitude. The eccle&s;ia|&s;tical
&s;tate is excluded, for rea&s;ons too evident to be &s;pecified; and like|wi&s;e
the Swi&s;s Cantons, becau&s;e there he would be deprived of the &s;ociety
of men, and at too great a di&s;tance from what he ought never to lo&s;e
&s;ight of; and he would have no neighbours there but goats, who could
walk out and re&s;i&s;t the rigour of the winter. The Spani&s;h Low Coun|tries
are named only in preference.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that &s;entiments are divided here about the article of the
indemnity. Some &s;ay that tho&s;e who are at home will complain, with
ju&s;tice, that they are abandoned to the fury of their enemies; and that
tho&s;e who are here, will exclaim that they are neglected, that they might
&s;ub&s;i&s;t at home, if they could return in &s;afety, and that this court will be
delivered from a number of trouble&s;ome people, who will die of hunger
after our departure. Others think, that a &s;ecurity for the pa&s;t will render
them u&s;ele&s;s for the future; that &s;elf-love is a powerful motive for ex|citing
the generality of men to perform their duty; that &s;everals may
return from thence full of ill-humour, and in order to be well received,
will become informers, which would produce very bad effects; and al&s;o,
that this would weaken the Iri&s;h regiments in the &s;ervice, many of whom
will be &s;eized with the &s;ickne&s;s of the Swi&s;s. It is hoped the King will
be plea&s;ed to decide upon this diver&s;ity of opinions.</P>
<P>With regard to the Queen's dowry, her Maje&s;ty orders me to tell
you, that after her death, and the re&s;toration of the King, her &s;on, &s;he
gives the million in the town-hou&s;e to his Maje&s;ty, to refund, in part,
&s;ome &s;mall &s;hare of his bounty. But above all, his Britannic Maje&s;ty in&s;i&s;ts
mo&s;t earne&s;tly not to be named in the article which concerns the Queen;
for, although there &s;hould be no expre&s;s condition, all the world will
&s;uppo&s;e that his honour will be deeply wounded by it. He will be aban|doned
by all his good &s;ubjects, and will find him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the con|tempt
of every one, which &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion will in&s;allibly draw upon
him."</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tran&s;lation.</HEAD>
<P>"ALL that regards the King of England's intere&s;t in the pre&s;ent con|juncture,
may be reduced to three articles.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the enemy in&s;i&s;t that the King of England leaves France, no|thing
will be more natural and rea&s;onable than to a&s;k them a &s;ecurity for
him. It is to be wi&s;hed it may be general. If, however, this meets
with difficulties, let them grant it, at lea&s;t, in a country that &s;uits
them. For there are countries where he will never put his foot, &s;uch as
the Pope's territories, and the Swi&s;s cantons. The Spani&s;h Low Coun|tries
appear to be the mo&s;t commodious, from their &s;ituation, and be|caufe
there will be no occa&s;ion for a &s;ecurity but from the Dutch, and
from the &s;overeign of the country, who mu&s;t oblige him&s;elf to allow the
King to live at full liberty, with a permi&s;&s;ion of travelling through all
his dominions, of choo&s;ing the place of his re&s;idence, and of changing it,
and of leaving his territories and coming back again, without being
obliged to take pa&s;&s;ports, or to give any explanations of the motives of
his journies. A prince cannot be too delicate in &s;uch a ca&s;e; and they
cannot, if they act &s;incerely, refu&s;e him the privileges which the law of
nations gives to private per&s;ons in time of peace.</P>
<P>It is propo&s;ed likewi&s;e, that his Maje&s;ty may be plea&s;ed to &s;ollicit
earne&s;tly for an indemnity to all tho&s;e who have followed the late King
of England, and the King's &s;on, as well as for tho&s;e who find them&s;elves
expo&s;ed to trouble&s;ome enquiries at home, for having done their duty
&s;ince the revolution in England. If they make the &s;ame demand for the
Hugonots, it will be a mere eva&s;ion; for they are de&s;irous of keeping
them, de&s;igning, by a general act of naturalization, to draw to them
every one who is not a Roman Catholic.</P>
<P>It is not believed that they will make great difficulty about the Queen's
dowry for the future, but about her arrears, although they cannot deny
but they are due for upwards of twenty years. If that cannot be ob|tained,
we mu&s;t propo&s;e the time of the peace of Ry&s;wick, when the
dowry was granted, and when the prince of Orange broke his word;
although he received from his parliament a fund for keeping it, he always
found pretences for doing &s;o. There is another term, which is common
<PB N="125" REF="140">
to all widows, and that is the death of their hu&s;bands, and the right
cea&s;es at the death of the Queen. But when the wor&s;t comes to the
wor&s;t, we mu&s;t accept it as they will choo&s;e to give it. It may be like|wi&s;e
propo&s;ed, that in ca&s;e they pay the Queen all the arrears, which
amount to a million &s;terling, her Maje&s;ty will renounce ab&s;olutely her
dowry, the revenue of that &s;um being preci&s;ely 50,000 l. &s;terling, at five
per cent. By this means &s;everal embarra&s;&s;ments will be avoided, her
Maje&s;ty will be a&s;&s;ured of her revenue, without authorizing any one in
England to receive it, and without di&s;puting about the form of di&s;|charges;
for they may exact &s;uch as &s;he never will grant, much le&s;s
will &s;he &s;eek redre&s;s in their courts of ju&s;tice; and to an&s;wer the chicane,
which was u&s;ed after the peace of Ry&s;wick, that this money might be
employed again&s;t them, his Maje&s;ty may oblige him&s;elf to place the &s;um
immediately in the town-hou&s;e of Paris."</P>

<Q><P>"He, the duke of Marlborough, added, that this &s;ame lord (meaning lord Town&s;end) had orders concerning the King of England, whom he &s;tiled Prince of Wales.

things:</P>
<P>1&s;t, With regard to their &s;aying, that they cannot pay the Queen's
dowry, as being contrary to the laws of England. In that they are not
&s;incere; for, although they have converted the fund to other purpo&s;es,
there never was any legal deci&s;ion again&s;t her Maje&s;ty or her preten&s;ions;
and the parliament, after the peace of Ry&s;wick, acknowledged them &s;o
fully, that they granted, without any difficulty, the whole &s;um, which
the prince of Orange received, and detained upon an ill founded chicane.</P>
<P>2dly, Their offer to charge them&s;elves with the maintainance of the
King, my ma&s;ter, in ca&s;e he leaves France, is to be &s;u&s;pected; and in|deed
one may ea&s;ily perceive, that the malicious de&s;ign of it, is to make
the world believe, that he renounced his preten&s;ions, on account of this
pen&s;ion, and at the &s;ame time, to have it in their power to reduce him to
the la&s;t extremity, which his Maje&s;ty will rather endure, than expo&s;e him|&s;elf

I now &s;ay, and explained it more fully in a letter I &s;ent to M. de Torcy,
the evening before he &s;et out.</P>
<P>3dly, The King of England is highly plea&s;ed, that a general &s;ecurity
is agreed to, in ca&s;e they in&s;i&s;t on his changing his place of abode. But it
ought to be con&s;idered, whether the word of the&s;e two Engli&s;h gentlemen

it may be repre&s;ented, that the King does not require the per&s;on he
&s;ends &s;hould be owned as a plenipotentiary in form from the King of

<P>"THE King of England believes that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for his
&s;ervice, and u&s;eful to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, to &s;end to the
Hague, in the pre&s;ent conjuncture, one of his &s;ubjects who is a man of
abilities and fidelity, who is well in&s;tructed in his affairs and capable of
carrying on a negociation, who would have a communication with the
French plenipotentiaries, and act in concert with them in all things, for
the common intere&s;t, and in conformity to the in&s;tructions with which
he &s;hall be intru&s;ted, without giving him any character.</P>
<P>This man, having no public character, would not be &s;ubjected to ce|remonies,
and might in&s;inuate him&s;elf and have acce&s;s every where as a
private man, without being &s;u&s;pected to be of any party; and under|&s;tanding
the language, laws, cu&s;toms, and manners of the Engli&s;h, he
might by frequenting them, di&s;cover their &s;ecret &s;entiments, and inform
the French plenipotentiaries of many things very u&s;eful, in the cour&s;e of
the negociation, it being very much the humour of the greate&s;t part of
the Engli&s;h, who may be very re&s;erved with the French, to open them|&s;elves
to, and place their confidence willingly in, a countryman, who
will appear to enter into their &s;entiments, and have the addre&s;s, by di&s;|covering
their different tempers, to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into their favour
prudently and rea&s;onably.</P>
<P>This &s;ecret agent, by going early to the Hague, before the opening of
the congre&s;s, will have time to renew the old acquaintances he formerly
had in that country, and to form new ones, to contract intimacies, and
manage intrigues and &s;ecret cabals, with the public mini&s;ters and other
men of credit of all the different nations, who may meet there in the pre|&s;ent
conjuncture, and of whom he may contribute to gain over &s;ome to
the intere&s;t of France, and to abate the violent oppo&s;ition of others, by
undeceiving them in many wrong impre&s;&s;ions with which they are pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.
He will be able to inform him&s;elf, thoroughly and at lei&s;ure,
of the different intere&s;ts of the plenipotentiaries, and of their cabals and
<PB N="131" REF="146">
divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, that he may take the advantage of them;
and, being of the &s;ame nation, he will have a more particular facility in
di&s;covering the inclinations, de&s;igns, and &s;chemes of the Engli&s;h pleni|potentiaries,
of whatever &s;ect of religion they are, who&s;e creatures they
are, and to what party in England they are attached; and, thus, know|ing
their &s;trength and their weakne&s;s, he will be able to give, from time
to time, excellent memorials concerning the&s;e things to the French ple|nipotentiaries.</P>
<P>And when the concerns of the King of England are in agitation, he
will be at hand to give informations to the &s;aid plenipotentiaries, con|cerning
the intentions and real intere&s;ts of his Britannic Maje&s;ty; and,
when the Engli&s;h object the difficulties and chicanery of their laws, as
they have done already, without any foundation, in the affair of the
Queen's dowry, he will be able to tell the French plenipotentiaries, with
certainty, what is true or fal&s;e in the allegations of the Engli&s;h, concern|ing
their laws, or the facts, which &s;hall be conte&s;ted, and to give them
ample explanations, on the &s;pot by memorials, which will refute the chi|canery
of the Engli&s;h, and hinder them from impo&s;ing ambiguous ex|pre&s;&s;ions
and advancing as truths facts which are notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e.</P>
<P>The advantage of &s;ending this man early to the Hague is evident;
for, in order to negociate with &s;ucce&s;s, he mu&s;t be on the &s;pot before
they begin to treat in form, in order to acquaint him&s;elf thoroughly
with the different characters of tho&s;e with whom he may have to do, to
&s;tudy their humours, their public and private intere&s;ts, and to tam|per
with tho&s;e who have credit with the principal mini&s;ters, endeavour|ing,
in that manner, to di&s;cover their &s;entiments, and to find means of
gaining them, or at lea&s;t of appea&s;ing them, on &s;everal articles, from mo|tives
of per&s;onal intere&s;t, joined to all the other rea&s;ons of ju&s;tice and
equity which can be &s;ugge&s;ted to them. Now, all this cannot be done,
but &s;lowly and by degrees. Their minds mu&s;t be previou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed,
and their prejudices removed, and a number of emi&s;&s;aries mu&s;t be em|ployed,
in order to be well in&s;tructed in every thing that happens, and
to be always ready to &s;eize every favourable opportunity. He mu&s;t be|gin
in time, and &s;pare nothing to gain over favourites, in order that he
may have free acce&s;s to their &s;uperiors, and find means of in&s;inuating
him&s;elf into their confidence, and of di&s;po&s;ing them in&s;en&s;ibly for a fa|vourable
<PB N="132" REF="147">
treaty; and, if all the&s;e intrigues and attentions are not begun,
and even carried &s;ome length before the congre&s;s opens, it will be very
difficult to begin them, with any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, during its continuance:
for then all the plenipotentiaries will be &s;o occupied, with receiving and
&s;ending of di&s;patches, with attendance on all the public and private con|ferences,
with receiving and returning vi&s;its, and di&s;charging the ceremo|nial
and e&s;&s;ential duties of their commi&s;&s;ion, that they will have &s;o little
&s;pare time as will render acce&s;s to them very difficult; and as the part
they are to act will be determined by that time, and all or mo&s;t of the
e&s;&s;ential articles agreed upon, it will be too late then to hope to carry
on a negociation of any importance for the &s;ervice of France, or for
that of his Britannic Maje&s;ty."</P>

<P>THE Hannover corre&s;pondence of the pre&s;ent year is connected with
the following facts. The lord Somers, who had been rai&s;ed to the
office of pre&s;ident of the council, moved for an addre&s;s to the Queen,
that &s;he would be plea&s;ed to &s;tipulate in the projected treaty, that the
French King &s;hould own the title of Queen Anne, and remove the Pre|tender
out of his dominions. The mini&s;ter, the earl of Godolphin and
the duke of Marlborough, who divided with his lord&s;hip the power of
government, were not aver&s;e from this motion. They &s;eem to have &s;ecretly
wi&s;hed his removal, as the &s;ure&s;t means of giving him the eventual &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of the throne, after his &s;i&s;ter's death; as they knew the un&s;ur|mountable
aver&s;ion the people had to the receiving a &s;overeign from
France.&mdash;The Electoral Prince&s;s, afterwards Queen of Great Britain,
was delivered of a prince&s;s who was baptized, by the name of Anne, in
compliment to Queen Anne. The King of Sweden was &s;topt, in the
career of his victories, by the total defeat of his army, in the fatal battle
of Pultowa, which was fought on the eighth of July. Tournay &s;urren|dered
to the Allies on the thirtieth of the &s;ame month. The bloody
battle of Blaregnies or Malplaquet was fought, on the eleventh of Sep|tember;
and Mons &s;urrendered, in the end of October. The&s;e are the
tran&s;actions to which the letters to and from the hou&s;e of Hannover prin|cipally

and which has pa&s;&s;ed, unanimou&s;ly, in the two hou&s;es of parliament.</P>
<P>Your Electoral Highne&s;s may remember, that I employed the time
which I pa&s;&s;ed in Holland, and all my attentions to conclude there, with,
the States, a treaty which might &s;ecure our &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and their barrier.
But they rendered the conclu&s;ion of it impracticable for me, by the de|mand
which they made then of being put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Oftend. Since
my return, there was little or nothing done in that affair. I hope that
the addre&s;s of to-day will &s;et on foot again that negociation, and produce
a league, for that effect, between mo&s;t of the high allies. The two
hou&s;es concurred &s;o unanimou&s;ly in this addre&s;s; the Queen received
it with &s;o much &s;atisfaction, and it has the public approbation to &s;uch a
degree; that I do not &s;ee that the nation can hear a peace mentioned, un|til
France is humbled, and obliged to admit &s;uch terms, that the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
in the prote&s;tant line will remain thereby certain and permanent.

were not reli&s;hed by the Dutch, who were entru&s;ted with the negociation

de&s;ires him to make what u&s;e of the memorial his own di&s;cretion
&s;hould dictate to him; but enjoins him &s;ecrecy, as he had &s;ent it without
the knowledge of the court of France. He thinks that the excluding
the King of England, and &s;o many of his neare&s;t heirs, from &s;ucceeding
to the crown, will, for a long time, continue di&s;&s;en&s;ions and wars in
Europe, which his re&s;toration alone can prevent; and to which he thinks
the neighbouring &s;tates, and particularly the Dutch, are, in common
prudence, bound to contribute. He a&s;ks a pa&s;&s;port for a tru&s;ty per&s;on,
whom his ma&s;ter might &s;end privately to them, to a&s;&s;ure them of his
attachment, and to cultivate a good under&s;tanding with them.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="162">
In the memorial, the Pretender &s;ets forth, that, as he will continue his
efforts for his own re&s;toration and the deliverance of his people, a &s;olid
peace can never be e&s;tabli&s;hed, while &s;o many millions of his &s;ubjects
were well affected to him. A &s;trict union with England was nece&s;&s;ary
for the United Provinces. His Maje&s;ty was &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to culti|vate
a good under&s;tanding with the States; and, from their great wi&s;dom
and penetration, he hoped to meet with corre&s;ponding &s;entiments in
them, and that they would find acts of friend&s;hip towards a prince who
&s;uffers unju&s;tly, and never was their enemy, con&s;i&s;tent with their own
intere&s;t, and with the principles of honour and ju&s;tice. England is the
only rival of Holland in commerce, which will often occa&s;ion animo&s;ities,
that will often terminate in open wars. It is the intere&s;t of the States
to &s;ecure the friend&s;hip of the &s;overeign of that country. A Catholic
King will be le&s;s in a condition to carry on a war again&s;t them, than a
Prote&s;tant; and if he is but King of England, he can only carry on a
war by &s;ea; whereas a Prote&s;tant prince, who has con&s;iderable territories
on the continent, and in their neighbourhood, can attack them by land,
as well as by &s;ea.</P>
<P>He then recommends two points to their con&s;ideration. He a&s;ks their
good offices at the en&s;uing treaty of peace, in obtaining a &s;ecurity for
the payment of the dowry of the Queen his mother; and al&s;o a &s;e|curity
for his own per&s;on, and for tho&s;e who will follow him when he
leaves France. He gives the &s;ame rea&s;ons for the&s;e demands which are

<P>It appears, that Leers wrote &s;everal letters, after receiving this memo|rial,

near. I entreat you to con&s;ider, that his Maje&s;ty, by removing to too
great a di&s;tance, would appear to renounce his preten&s;ions. Now there
is no hard&s;hip which he is not determined to &s;uffer, rather than give
room to &s;u&s;pect him of &s;uch meanne&s;s; and, though Avignon was &s;itu|ated
near Oftend, his Maje&s;ty would never &s;et his foot in it; becau&s;e his
enemies would contrive to make the general hatred to the Pope fall upon
him. I can a&s;&s;ure you, that the duke of Marlborough explained him|&s;elf,
la&s;t year, to Mon&s;ieur de Torcy, in &s;uch a way, as to make him
conclude, that the King would be under no re&s;traint, in choo&s;ing the
place of his abode, nor obliged to confine him&s;elf to any particular place;
and even that the Engli&s;h, by in&s;i&s;ting that he &s;hould leave France, were
obliged to provide for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence."</Q></P>

to &s;ay to me, than was in his paper, which you have. This more
was no great matter, though much more than I believe; he pretends to
have &s;een lord Athol, Braidalbin, &amp;c. and that they &s;ay, that, if the King
of France cannot be brought to help them, they will do my bu&s;ine&s;s
them&s;elves, provided I come to them. But then he brings no other &s;e|curity
of what he &s;ays, but his own word, and an ample credential from
lord Drummond, whom he affirms to be &s;ent by the re&s;t. How im|probable
all this is, you may ea&s;ily &s;ee. However, not to &s;eem to
&s;u&s;pect the man, I was very civil to him, and took all he &s;aid as argent
comptant, for fear he &s;hould think to be di&s;covered, and di&s;appear
before the Queen's an&s;wer comes, which I &s;hall expect before I do any
more in the matter. In the mean time, he &s;ays, lord Drummond won't
&s;tir from Gand, where he now is, till he receives my farther orders.
This man is certainly employed by the government, to betray my friends;
&s;o that when he comes to you (for I &s;uppo&s;e the Queen will think that
nece&s;&s;ary) one cannot have too great an eye over him, till one can, at
lea&s;t, hear from Scotland, what ground there is for what he affirms.
But I refer to the Queen, to do, in this matter, what &s;he thinks fit.
She has your&s;elf and a few others to con&s;ult, and I am here alone, which
is far from ea&s;y to me, upon many accounts. But nece&s;&s;ity has no law;
and that alone could have made me not carry you along with me;
though, at pre&s;ent, I really begin to believe I &s;hall not be long from you;
for the enemies immobility looks very like a truce. I am &s;ure we want
it, for we have no money, bread but hardly, though hitherto exactly

them&s;elves might retain their power. The monied intere&s;t in the city,
in particular the governour and directors of the bank, repre&s;ented the
danger of turning out the lord-trea&s;urer, and &s;uch per&s;ons as he could
tru&s;t. The duke of Marlborough had influence &s;ufficient with the allies,
to induce them to interfere in the cau&s;e of his party. The comte de
Galas, amba&s;&s;ador for the Emperor and King Charles the Third, together
with Vrybergen, the Dutch amba&s;&s;ador, repre&s;ented to the Queen, the dan|ger
of making any change among her &s;ervants. She however, though
&s;he an&s;wered them politely, &s;eemed determined not to comply with their
demands, except in the article of the duke of Marlborough's continuing
in the command of the army. The duke him&s;elf, with his u&s;ual addre&s;s
and coolne&s;s, affected to acquie&s;ce in the Queen's plea&s;ure. But he &s;eems
to have entered privately into a &s;cheme of revenge, by his renewing,
with more warmth, his corre&s;pondence with the court of St. Germains.
The following letter from the earl of Middleton, will throw a complete

<P>WHAT you wrote to your nephew, on the 13th of the la&s;t month,
is of &s;o great importance to Mr. Matthews [the King] and
your&s;elf, that I think my&s;elf obliged, for your intere&s;t and his, to write
to you my opinion of it, with my own hand; your nephew, who &s;et
out from this place &s;uddenly, being now at too great a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall tell you, in the fir&s;t place, that as I was glad to find you &s;till
continue in your good re&s;olutions towards Mr. Matthews [the King], I was
&s;urpri&s;ed, on the other hand, to &s;ee that you had a de&s;ign of quitting every
thing, as &s;oon as the peace was concluded; for I find that to be the only
means of rendering you u&s;ele&s;s to your friends, and your retreat may prove
dangerous likewi&s;e to your&s;elf; you are too large a mark, and too much
expo&s;ed for malice to mi&s;s; and your enemies will never believe them|&s;elves
in &s;afety, until they have ruined you. They will reduce the army,
and the troops that are allowed to &s;tand, will be all compo&s;ed of their
own creatures. All the civil offices and military employments will be
filled by men who are of their party. They will change the officers of
<PB N="159" REF="174">
the revenue, and the credit of the&s;e new officers, with the influence which
the preachers of their party have over the people, will not fail to pro|duce
a new parliament of a very different temper from the pre&s;ent: thus
your enemies will have all the power to hurt you, and you know well,
they will not want the inclination.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, therefore, to reflect well, before you deprive your&s;elf
of the means you have in your hands, to &s;upport your&s;elf and to a&s;&s;i&s;t
your friends.</P>
<P>But, as you are lo&s;t, if you quit your employments, I &s;ee likewi&s;e, on
the other hand, that it will be very difficult for you to keep your&s;elf in
office, as things are now &s;ituated, fo that your intere&s;t it&s;elf declares now
for your honour. You cannot be in &s;afety without doing ju&s;tice, nor
pre&s;erve your greatne&s;s without di&s;charging your duty, and the time is
precious to you as well as for us.</P>
<P>The advice you give us, in &s;ending us to the new favourite <HI>(lady)</HI> is
very obliging; but what can we hope from a &s;tranger who has no obli|gation
to us? Whereas, we have all the rea&s;ons in the world to depend
upon you, &s;ince we have now but the &s;ame intere&s;t to manage, and you
have the power to put Mr. Matthews [the King] in a condition to pro|tect
you. Lay a&s;ide then, I be&s;eech you, your re&s;olutions of retiring.
Take courage, and without lo&s;ing more time, &s;end us a per&s;on in whom
you have an entire confidence; or if you have not &s;uch a man with
you, allow us to &s;end you one whom we may tru&s;t, in order to concert
mea&s;ures for our common intere&s;t, which can never be properly done
by letters. We &s;hall know, by your &s;peedy and po&s;itive an&s;wer to
this letter, what judgment we can form of our affairs.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not fini&s;h my letter, without thanking you, for promi&s;ing to

renewed. M. de Vauban, who came from Bethune, on Wedne&s;day,
was told &s;o by &s;ome of the enemy's generals. Letters from Tournay
&s;peak of it, and now even the gazettes them&s;elves. I cannot but hope
now they will break off no more. I am &s;ure Mrs. Betty [him&s;elf]
heartily wi&s;hes it, that &s;he may quit Mr. Williams's country [France, of

tells you our news; &s;o I &s;hall only add, that we begin now to hope we
&s;hall end the campaign on the banks of the Canihe. Our general doth
all he can to end his with the enemy; and I left him ju&s;t now in hopes

<P>"YOU would have received the inclo&s;ed memorial &s;ooner, if it had
not been nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end it fir&s;t to the King, my ma&s;ter, in order
<PB N="164" REF="179">
to have his approbation, and receive his orders concerning it. Although
we were unwilling to repeat over again former memorials, it was, how|ever,
judged nece&s;&s;ary to put you in mind of &s;ome principal points.
You will find in it again the word Capital; for if you begin with this
project, you will find every thing that is nece&s;&s;ary to make it &s;o. But,
if in preference, you mean to execute every other de&s;ign, and to put off
this as &s;uperfluous, I own, before hand, you will find nothing in it.</P>
<P>All that is new in this memorial is, the &s;tate of England, and the de|mand
made of the Iri&s;h troops. As to what regards England, it is a
matter of indifference to you whether the parliament be di&s;&s;olved or not;
or whether the high or the low church prevail. You will always find
they are your enemies; and I am very &s;orry, Sir, to tell you, that even
our friends will do nothing for you, while you do nothing for them.
They don't believe you are di&s;po&s;ed to do any thing; and there is no|thing
but an actual landing which can cure them of their credulity.
That will contribute to conceal the de&s;ign in that country; but it will be
more difficult to conceal it here, becau&s;e all conver&s;ations at the Thuil|leries,
and in Coffee hou&s;es, run upon this project; and the voice of
the people de&s;ire it, as the only remedy to their calamities.</P>
<P>With regard to the demand of the Iri&s;h troops, I con&s;ider it as granted,
becau&s;e it cannot be conjectured from what motive it can be refu&s;ed;
&s;ince, be&s;ides the convincing rea&s;ons of the memorial, the Iri&s;h making
but half the number of troops which was propo&s;ed, the armies will be
le&s;s dimini&s;hed by it, and they will be tran&s;ported with le&s;s difficulty,
and at le&s;s expence; and it is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ervice to do every thing
which humanly may &s;ecure its &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ince thereby we &s;hall gain our
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If the bad news from Spain are confirmed, they &s;hould forward this
project, becau&s;e he will be more pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, and you will have
no favourable pro&s;pect from any other quarter. In &s;hort, it is nece&s;&s;ary
to determine upon &s;omething. Even though this project &s;hould be dif|ficult,
a peace is impo&s;&s;ible; therefore there is no choice. I am, Sir,

<P>IN the &s;everal memorials which have been formerly pre&s;ented to the
court of France from his Britannic Maje&s;ty, concerning his re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment,
it hath been &s;hown, that a well-concerted enterpri&s;e again&s;t
Scotland would be the mo&s;t certain means to accompli&s;h it; and that
that enterpri&s;e would, at the &s;ame time, be the mo&s;t efficacious, not to
&s;ay the &s;ole means, to break the confederacy of the enemy, and to re|e&s;tabli&s;h
France in its former &s;uperiority: that all the other means tried
till then, whether by force of arms or by negociations, had produced no
effect: that the enterpri&s;e again&s;t Scotland had been tried only once
that it was evident to all the world it would have &s;ucceeded, if &s;everal
ob&s;tacles had not occurred; and that both friends and enemies acknow|ledged
that, if his Britannic Maje&s;ty had landed then, all Scotland would
have declared for him, the bank of England would have been &s;hut up,
and con&s;equently the government of England overturned, and the league
di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;hown, in the&s;e memorials, that the changes which hap|pened
in Scotland &s;ince that time, were all advantageous to the King;
that the people were irritated more than ever again&s;t the pre&s;ent govern|ment,
on account of the bad treatment they had received from it: that,
at the &s;ame time, no one had de&s;erted the King's party, even after the
bad &s;ucce&s;s of that enterpri&s;e: that no &s;ecret had been ever kept like this
one; &s;ince, of &s;o great a number, both of the nobility and of the prin|cipal
per&s;ons among the commoners, there was not one who would ac|knowledge
any thing, or accu&s;e any of tho&s;e who had been apprehended,
notwith&s;tanding all the threatenings and all the promi&s;es of the govern|ment;
and that witne&s;&s;es could never be found to condemn any one of
tho&s;e who have been apprehended, whatever efforts were made by the
<PB N="166" REF="181">
&s;ervants of the government for that purpo&s;e; &s;o that there can be no
doubt of the good di&s;po&s;ition of the Scots.</P>
<P>With regard to the Iri&s;h, it hath been likewi&s;e &s;hown, in the&s;e memo|rials,
that their di&s;po&s;ition hath been always the &s;ame with regard to
their lawful &s;overeign, founded upon intere&s;t, liberty, and religion; and
it may be added, that the Catholics, who are at lea&s;t &s;ix to one Prote|&s;tant,
are reduced to &s;uch de&s;pair, by the la&s;t per&s;ecution of the Engli&s;h
government, and are more di&s;po&s;ed than ever to hazard all, and to un|dertake
every thing, in order to free them&s;elves from the oppre&s;&s;ion they &s;uffer.</P>
<P>It is very true, that in the memorials which have been hitherto pre|&s;ented,
the &s;ame a&s;&s;urances could not be given of the di&s;po&s;ition of Eng|land;
all that could be &s;aid of it, with certainty, was that an in&s;urrection
in Scotland, in the King's favour, would have thrown the affairs of Eng|land
into confu&s;ion. But now, it is very evident, that the &s;urpri&s;ing
changes which have for &s;ome time appeared in the affections of the peo|ple
of England, and which are &s;een to increa&s;e every day, leave not the
&s;malle&s;t room to doubt of their being well di&s;po&s;ed towards their lawful
&s;overeign.</P>
<P>Two parties, animated to an extreme again&s;t one another, evidently
e&s;tabli&s;h the right of that prince in their public writings. The high church
maintain, as a principle of their religion, that it is never allowable to
re&s;i&s;t their King for any cau&s;e what&s;oever; and that the hereditary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
is a law &s;o fundamental, that the parliament it&s;elf cannot change
it. The low church, to &s;how the high to be enemies to the pre&s;ent go|vernment,
maintain, that the con&s;equence of the fir&s;t of the&s;e principles
is, that the government, &s;ince the Revolution, hath been but a continued
u&s;urpation, and that the princes who have occupied the throne, have
been but u&s;urpers; and that the con&s;equence of the &s;econd principle is,
that the Pretender mu&s;t be acknowledged as lawful King. The people,
attentive &s;pectators of this di&s;pute, have no difficulty in concluding that
both the one and the other are in the right; and the prince&s;s, who is in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by taking the high church into her con&s;idence, and giving
them the be&s;t employments, &s;eems to declare intelligibly enough, what
are her inclinations towards her brother. This far the invi&s;ible hand of
<PB N="167" REF="182">
Providence hath already conducted this affair; employing even its
greate&s;t enemies to advance it, without their perceiving it.</P>
<P>It is therefore very evident, that the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of his Britannic
Maje&s;ty's affairs is more favourable than ever; and that, according to all
appearances, he need only have patience for a little time, as &s;everal of
his Maje&s;ty's friends in that country advice him, and leave Providence to
act, in order to enter into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his right, by the means of his
own &s;ubjects alone.</P>
<P>But, however well founded the&s;e hopes of his Britannic Maje&s;ty from
his own &s;ubjects may be, he is not the le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly affected with the bad
&s;tate of the affairs of France; and this is what induces him to offer now
again to expo&s;e his per&s;on in a &s;econd attempt in Scotland, in order to
procure to France a peace, of which &s;he has &s;o much need, providing
the Iri&s;h troops are given to him to attend him in the enterprize. This
he judges &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the intere&s;t of France, as well as his
own, that, without it, he believes it is needle&s;s to think of &s;uch a pro|ject.</P>
<P>His Britannic Maje&s;ty would wi&s;h that he had no occa&s;ion for any
troops for this expedition. But, however well a&s;&s;ured he may be of the
good will of the greate&s;t part of Scotland, yet, as all the fortre&s;&s;es, as
well as the regular troops of the country, are in the hands of the govern|ment,
and ready to act by their orders, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for the
&s;ecurity of his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, as well as for the &s;ucce&s;s of the enter|prize,
that he &s;hould have a &s;ufficient number of troops with him at
landing, to oppo&s;e the enemy, until his faithful &s;ubjects have time to
a&s;&s;emble and to join him. The prince of Orange, although he was &s;ure,
before hand, of all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men in England, and even of
the chief officers in the army of the late King of England, as appeared
&s;ufficiently by the event, judged, however, that it was improper to un|dertake
the enterprize without being attended with fourteen thou&s;and
regular troops.</P>
<P>In the former memorials, the King of England could never demand
le&s;s than &s;ix thou&s;and men; his &s;ubjects having always a&s;ked eight thou|&s;and
men to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition. It is true, in lord
Drummond's la&s;t memorial, three thou&s;and men only are mentioned.
<PB N="168" REF="183">
But it is likewi&s;e true, that that nobleman does not deny, but he has con|certed
his projects with the Highlanders alone, without the knowledge
of the chief men in the low country, who compo&s;e the greate&s;t part of
the nation. Yet his Britannic Maje&s;ty, con&s;idering how difficult it would
be to tran&s;port a greater number, has limited his demand to the Iri&s;h
troops, his own &s;ubjects; who, at the end of the campaign, will be &s;carce
three thou&s;and effective men. What ab&s;olutely determines his Maje&s;ty
to a&s;k the Iri&s;h is, that they &s;peak the &s;ame language, and are accu&s;tomed
to the hardy manner of living of the country; and that, of each Iri&s;h
regiment, two or three may be formed, by incorporating with them the
new levies of the country: be&s;ides, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to keep the
Iri&s;h in France, after they know that the King is landed in Scotland.</P>
<P>But there is likewi&s;e a rea&s;on, which his Maje&s;ty thinks he &s;hould not
pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, and which appears to him to be very e&s;&s;ential;
namely, that the allies will no &s;ooner &s;ee the landing &s;ucceed, than, dread|ing
the con&s;equences with which it mu&s;t be infallibly attended to their
di&s;advantage, they will make fraudulent propo&s;als of peace to France,
in order to ward off the blow. One of the&s;e propo&s;als will be, to de&s;ire
the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King to withdraw the troops who may have followed
that prince; and, as his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty will not choo&s;e to do &s;o,
he will have a very ju&s;ti&s;iable excu&s;e, in &s;aying, that they are not his
&s;ubjects, but the &s;ubjects of the King of England, which he could not
&s;ay if they were native Frenchmen.</P>
<P>With regard to the tran&s;port of troops and other nece&s;&s;aries, in which
the greate&s;t difficulty con&s;i&s;ts, tho&s;e who have experience in maritime af|fairs
are the be&s;t, or rather the only judges of that affair. What is very
certain and nece&s;&s;ary to be remarked here, is, that, unle&s;s this enterpri&s;e
is con&s;idered as a capital object to the &s;tate, difficulties will occur on all
hands to di&s;courage, and imaginary dangers, which will become real
when things are done by halves: &s;o that, to attempt it, in any other
view, will be u&s;ele&s;s to France and hurtful to the King of England. But,
if his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty will find this expedition of importance
enough to con&s;ider it as a capital object; in that ca&s;e, money, arms, and
ammunition, as well as &s;hips and troops, will be found without any dif|ficulty;
and he will likewi&s;e find &s;ea-officers, who will undertake it, and
who, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will accompli&s;h it.</P>

The port of Dunkirk has its advantages for the embarkation, on ac|count
of the neighbourhood of the troops and the &s;hortne&s;s of the pa&s;|&s;age.
But the &s;ecret can never be kept: for every thing that is done
there is known the next day at O&s;tend; and when once the Engli&s;h and
the Dutch have di&s;covered the de&s;ign, they will be always in a condition
to thwart it.</P>
<P>It appears then, that Bre&s;t would be more &s;uitable, becau&s;e the ene|my
could not ea&s;ily hinder the ve&s;&s;els from &s;ailing from that port, as was
&s;een by experience, during the war in Ireland. In ca&s;e the preference
is given to that port, the Iri&s;h troops &s;hould be put into winter-quarters
in the neighbouring provinces.</P>
<P>It might be likewi&s;e examined, whether Portpa&s;&s;age, near Fontara|bia,
was &s;it for embarkation. In that ca&s;e, the Iri&s;h regiments might be
&s;ent to that quarter, as if they were to go to &s;erve in Spain; and his Bri|tannic
Maje&s;ty might repair thither, under the &s;ame pretext, and his re|moving
at a di&s;tance from his kingdoms would conceal the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e the troops embark at Bre&s;t or at Portpa&s;&s;age, they may
land anywhere on the we&s;t coa&s;t of Scotland, from Kirkcudbright to the
mouth of the river Clyde. It is true, there is no fortified harbour there,
nor in any other part of Scotland, which would render the landing more
ea&s;y. But, at the &s;ame time, the &s;hips could not remain there afterwards,
in &s;afety, in ca&s;e they were pur&s;ued by a &s;uperior force.</P>
<P>With regard to pilots, they might be had from that country, though
not without giving &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of the de&s;ign. But, as &s;hips from
Gla&s;gow, Air, and Kirkcudbright, come ordinarily towards the month of
November, to Nantz and Bourdeaux, &s;ailors to &s;erve as pilots might be
taken out of them, on different pretences. Be&s;ides that, &s;ome might be
found among the French privateers, who cruize frequently on that coa&s;t;
as five or &s;ix of the&s;e privateers, not long ago, made a de&s;cent in Scot|land,
near Air, from whence they carried away &s;ome cattle and alarmed
the country. It may be known from them, where they got their pilots,
and their method may be followed.</P>
<P>The &s;quadron, &s;ailing from Bre&s;t or from Portpa&s;&s;age, may &s;teer their
cour&s;e through St. George's channel, or round the we&s;t of Ireland: the
fir&s;t is the &s;horte&s;t cour&s;e; but is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t dangerous. Yet the

&s;hould be taken to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition; and referring, for
that purpo&s;e, to former memorials, we &s;hall only repeat, in concluding,
that the &s;ucce&s;s will entirely depend on the manner in which the enter|pri&s;e
is con&s;idered, as of greater or le&s;s importance to France. It is the

<P>The following anecdote de&s;erves credit, from collateral proofs. There
is no doubt but Marlborough and Godolphin had talked about a &s;cheme
of re&s;toring the Pretender &s;ome time or other, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
France. Godolphin was probably &s;incere; &s;o would Marlborough have
been, &s;hould the thing it&s;elf happen to &s;uit his intere&s;t.</P>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Me|morandum-book, marked vol. xi. 410. p. 38.</NOTE><P>"LORD Godolphin had certainly the be&s;t head and capacity for a mi|ni&s;ter
of &s;tate of any man in England; and was a man that no
country in the world might be a&s;hamed of. He had not the lea&s;t tinc|ture
of avarice, and was the uncorrupte&s;t man in his time, in the ma|nagement
of the trea&s;ury and di&s;charge of his offices. He was lord
chamberlain to King James's Queen, who had always (as Mr. Dillon told
me, April, 22d 1724) a very great opinion of him; and Mr. Dillon be|lieves
he really intended to &s;erve the King. He has &s;ent many of his
letters to that Queen; and the letters are &s;till in being.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on, perhaps, why he did not execute what he projected, was
his cowardice. Nobody could have more of that temper of mind; and
he was &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of fear, that the Whigs could bully and frighten
him into any thing.</P>
<P>This has made me remember what the E. of A., who was very inti|mate
with him, told me, in 1716, viz. That lord Godolphin was the
true&s;t and &s;incere&s;t friend to the King, that he ever had; and that, after
his di&s;grace, on Dr. Sacheverel's trial, about a month after he was turned
out, making him a vi&s;it, lord Godolphin expre&s;&s;ed his concern at his
being turned out, before he had re&s;tored the King: that he had been in
unhappy circum&s;tances and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the Tories: that all his mini&s;try
<PB N="171" REF="186">
had been &s;pent in a &s;truggle with the junto, who&s;e hands the Tories had
forced him into; but that he &s;aw him&s;elf at la&s;t ma&s;ter over them, when
he was turned out on occa&s;ion of the trial, which he was noways concerned
at but on the King's account. That, however, he was of opinion, lord Ox|ford
would re&s;tore him; but he would make France nece&s;&s;ary to it, which
him&s;elf would not have done; for he would have re&s;tored him alone, and
made the French know how poorly they had treated him, and how little
they de&s;erved at his hands; and the E. of A. believed him."</P></Q>

from them, than their conduct and &s;peeches in the cour&s;e of doctor
Sacheverel's trial. Godolphin began the pro&s;ecution more from private
re&s;entment, than &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity, and imprudently furni&s;hed his enemies
with an opportunity of ruining him and his friends, when he unwarily
gave importance to a man and a cau&s;e, which he &s;hould have treated with
neglect and contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="191">
The Queen was pre&s;ent at the trial, and li&s;tened with great attention
to the debates, in which a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition betrayed both parties to
advance principles, which probably neither of them would follow to their
utmo&s;t extent. The Tories openly maintained the doctrine of heredi|tary
right and non|re&s;i&s;tance; and the Whigs, in ju&s;tifying the Revo|lution,
a&s;&s;erted a nation's right to depo&s;e and dethrone their &s;overeign,
and laid down maxims of government more favourable to the privileges
of parliament and the liberties of the people, than monarchs choo&s;e to
adopt.</P>
<P>The Tories had not &s;trength to prevent Sacheverel from being found
guilty of all the articles for which he was impeached by the commons;
but they had influence afterwards to procure addre&s;&s;es to the Queen from
all parts of the nation, avowing the very principles for which he was con|demned.
The&s;e addre&s;&s;es a&s;&s;erted the doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and
non-re&s;i&s;tance, and acknowledged the ab&s;olute power of the crown.
They condemned, as antimonarchical and republican, all doctrines which
allowed &s;ubjects to re&s;i&s;t their &s;overeigns in any in&s;tance, and declared
the defenders of the&s;e doctrines to be advocates of bla&s;phemy and im|piety:
they affirmed that the Queen acceded to the throne by a heredi|tary,
and not by a precarious parliamentary right or election: they en|treated
a di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent parliament, and contained a&s;&s;urances
that none &s;hould be cho&s;en in a new election, but &s;uch as &s;hould be loyal
to the &s;overeign and zealous for the church.</P>
<P>The&s;e addre&s;&s;es could not fail to be more agreeable to Anne, a wo|man
and a &s;overeign, than tho&s;e pre&s;ented by the Whigs in a different,
though dutiful and re&s;pectful &s;train. In con&s;equence of the fir&s;t, &s;he
determined to emancipate her&s;elf, and to change her mini&s;try, notwith|&s;tanding
the &s;ucce&s;s with which they had &s;erved her, and an interpo&s;ition
in their favour by the mini&s;ters of the Emperor and of the States|general,
who were directed to repre&s;ent to her Maje&s;ty what bad influ|ence
a change might have on affairs abroad.</P>
<P>This change furni&s;hes a new &s;et of corre&s;pondents in the cour&s;e
of this year, when the following per&s;ons came into office. The duke
of Shrew&s;bury was made lord chamberlain on the 13th of April, in
the room of the marquis of Kent, who was gratified with a duke|dom.
Dartmouth was made &s;ecretary of &s;tate in the room of the
<PB N="177" REF="192">
earl of Sunderland, who was turned out, the 14th of June. The earl
of Godolphin was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the 8th of Augu&s;t, and in his room, earl
Powlet, Robert Harley, Henry Paget, Sir Thomas Man&s;el, and Robert
Ben&s;on, were appointed commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury. Though Powlet
was the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner in form, it was well known, that Harley, who
was made chancellor and under|trea&s;urer of the exchequer, had the chief
management of the trea&s;ury, and pre&s;ided in every thing, behind the
curtain.</P>
<P>Mr. James Cre&s;&s;et, who had been formerly envoy extraordinary at the
courts of Zell and Hannover, was cho&s;en by the new mini&s;try to carry
a&s;&s;urances of their attachment to the pre&s;umptive heirs of the crown;
and upon his death, which happened &s;oon after his nomination, the earl
of Rivers was &s;ent to Hannover, in the month of Augu&s;t, with the &s;ame
commi&s;&s;ion. He was authorized to a&s;&s;ure the prince&s;s Sophia and her
&s;on the Elector, that the late changes, for which the Queen had &s;uffi|cient
rea&s;ons, were rather favourable to them, and a further &s;ecurity for
their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of September the Queen i&s;&s;ued a proclamation to di&s;&s;olve
the parliament. The earl of Roche&s;ter was made lord pre&s;ident of the
council, in the room of lord Somers. The lord chamberlain's &s;taff was
taken from the duke of Devon&s;hire, and given to the duke of Bucking|ham.
Mr. Boyle was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the po&s;t of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and
the &s;eals were given to Mr. Henry St. John. The great &s;eal, upon the
re&s;ignation of the lord chancellor Cowper, was given to Sir Simon Har|court;
and the lord lieutenancy of Ireland to the duke of Ormond, upon
the re&s;ignation of the earl of Wharton. The earl of Portmore was ap|pointed
commander in chief of her Maje&s;ty's forces in Portugal, and the
duke of Hamilton lord lieutenant of the county palatine of Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>Harley did not make &s;uch an entire change as the Tories expected.
But the numbers who were turned out of office now, and on another oc|ca&s;ion
&s;oon after, &s;ufficiently prove, that the Whigs had as carefully ex|cluded
the Tories from all places of honour and profit, as the Tories
would have now excluded the Whigs in their turn. The military ope|rations,
mentioned in the corre&s;pondence of this year, are the taking of
Douay on the 26th of June, of Bethune the 29th Augu&s;t, of St. Ve|nant
the 30th September, and of Aire the 9th November. The baron
<PB N="178" REF="193">
de Bothmar was expected as envoy extraordinary from the Elector; <MILESTONE N="January." UNIT="month"> and

that mea&s;ure has only &s;erved to draw on me their hatred. Be&s;ides,

<P>I Received, with great gratitude, the letter or the 5th or January,
with which your Maje&s;ty honoured me. There is nothing more
worthy or your zeal for the good cau&s;e, than the lively exhortations
which you take care to make to all the allies, to induce them to act with
more vigour than heretofore, again&s;t the common enemy; and nothing
would be more ju&s;t than to imitate the great example which your Ma|je&s;ty
gives in that re&s;pect. It does not depend upon my repre&s;entations,
that that does not happen in the Empire; but they have been hitherto &s;o
ineffectual, that I dare not promi&s;e my&s;elf a better &s;ucce&s;s for the future.
This obliged me to dive&s;t my&s;elf of the command of the army on the
Rhine, as I did my&s;elf the honour of notifying to your Maje&s;ty, by my
former letter. I would imagine, that I encroached upon your time, if
I repeated the rea&s;ons which it contains. I flatter my&s;elf that your Ma|je&s;ty
will honour them with your approbation, and that you will ac|knowledge,
that nothing but an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;iry could induce me to
adopt &s;uch a mea&s;ure; and that feeing my pre&s;ence u&s;ele&s;s with the army

<P>I Could not ob&s;erve, but with great regret, the re&s;olution which you
took of dive&s;ting your&s;elf of the command of the army on the
Rhine, as you notified to me, in your letter of the 15th of January;
and confirmed again by another of the 6th of February. I am very &s;orry
<PB N="180" REF="195">
that you have had &s;o many rea&s;ons to induce you to adopt that mea&s;ure; <MILESTONE N="April." UNIT="month">
but, as I am per&s;uaded that your pre&s;ence with that army is of the la&s;t
importance, I cannot hinder my&s;elf from hoping, that matters will run
in a better train; and that the &s;tates of the Empire, &s;eeing that they are
to lo&s;e &s;uch a leader at the head of their troops, will exert them&s;elves to
remedy the di&s;orders of which they complain: and for this purpo&s;e I
wrote, &s;ome time ago, to the princes and circles of the Empire; and I
pre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly his Imperial Maje&s;ty to remove the difficulties which
may hinder you: and I have rea&s;on to believe, that my repre&s;entations
have had a good effect; for, I own, that my confidence, with regard to
that army, was always in your conduct and in your valour. And you
appear to me to be the only one who is able to render it, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
u&s;eful to the common cau&s;e; and if you ab&s;olutely throw up that
command, I &s;ee nothing that can keep the enemy at bay, on that &s;ide.
The &s;ea&s;on for the campaign advances, and a diver&s;ion on the upper
Rhine will have an extraordinary effect to the advantage of the common
cau&s;e. It is for this rea&s;on I continue to &s;hew you &s;till the de&s;ire I have
that you may reconcile your&s;elf to the command of the army on the

above every thing that can happen on that &s;ide, where all the world mu&s;t

for rendering the arms of the Empire more u&s;eful and more glorious than
they have been heretofore. I am, with a great deal of affection and

<P>"IT is with joy I pre&s;ume, once more, with the mo&s;t profound re|&s;pect
imaginable, to addre&s;s my&s;elf to your Electoral Highne&s;s;
and to tell you that her Maje&s;ty begins to reign, and that the oligarchy
which tyrannized and threatened &s;o long the Queen and the Briti&s;h na|tions,
begins to vani&s;h in this kingdom; where a little cabal made obe|dience
the duty of the &s;overeign, and dominion the prerogative of two or
three &s;ubjects for &s;ome years." He then tells him, that her Maje&s;ty has
placed her&s;elf on the throne and at the head of her trea&s;ury. That &s;he
has &s;ent bills of exchange to Holland, for paying her troops in Flanders
and Portugal; "and &s;he has made &s;ufficient provi&s;ion for their payment
for the next &s;ix months, notwith&s;tanding the tricks and chicane of the
lord Godolphin and his party."</P>
<P>"The nation in general adores her Maje&s;ty, and commends extremely
the conduct of the new mini&s;try; who had the courage and loyalty &s;o
&s;ea&s;onably to pre&s;erve the Queen and the monarchy. It is very certain,
that four years ago, the Queen thought of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her trea&s;urer and
her general. But the corruption of the two la&s;t parliaments always pre|vented
her." By Mr. Harley's good offices, he &s;ays, the Queen received
the duke of Shrew&s;bury into her confidence, as well as Mr. Harley him|&s;elf,
"who was always very loyal and active, and religiou&s;ly devoted to
the intere&s;ts of her Maje&s;ty and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in the illu&s;trious
family of your Electoral Highne&s;s."</P>
<P>"The Queen cannot avoid &s;u&s;pecting all tho&s;e, who have a familiar
corre&s;pondence with her general, who had already &s;et him&s;elf up as a pro|tector;
and his creatures had the in&s;olence, as well as the impudence,
during all the la&s;t winter, to drink to his health under that &s;ine title."
He tells him, that the general and trea&s;urer, afraid of contributing to the
<PB N="190" REF="205">
advantage of his Electoral Highne&s;s, and of re&s;toring to the Queen the
liberty, of which &s;he had been &s;o long deprived, were induced to intrigue
with their party in the hou&s;e of commons, to take notice of &s;ome impru|dent
expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;peaker; and, by that means to embarra&s;s her
Maje&s;ty's affairs, and prevent their own fall. When Shrew&s;bury, he
&s;ays, was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his office, without the knowledge of the
trea&s;urer or the general, his duche&s;s, with her u&s;ual in&s;olence, began to
quarrel with her Maje&s;ty. But her Maje&s;ty, wearied of hearing &s;o much
abu&s;e from &s;uch a peevi&s;h woman, forbad her to appear in her pre&s;ence;
&s;ince which time, her Maje&s;ty has been allowed to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s in
peace.</P>
<P>"At length the earl of Rivers is gone to fulfil the office which Mr.
Cre&s;&s;et<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cre&s;&s;et had been &s;ent in capacity of envoy from her Maje&s;ty to his Electoral Highne&s;s.</NOTE> had to execute. An individual &s;hould never pretend to know
what the commi&s;&s;ions of his &s;overeign contain, with regard to affairs of
&s;tate; of which, it is certain, the public is entirely ignorant. The ca|bal,
and the public mini&s;ters of the foreign potentates, who were always
clo&s;ely connected with lord Godolphin, and who were almo&s;t all &s;educed,
or rather charmed and bewitched by him, for very &s;trong rea&s;ons, no
doubt, give out in their public walks and conver&s;ation, that lord Rivers
is &s;ent by her Maje&s;ty to offer the command of the army to your Elec|toral
Highne&s;s; at lea&s;t, to come over to this country and pay a vi&s;it to
her Maje&s;ty, &amp;c. What! &s;ay they, will a great &s;overeign prince, as
the Elector of Brun&s;wick, leave his own dominions and vi&s;it the Queen?
or will he chu&s;e to command an army after a general who has triumphed
&s;o often, gained &s;o many battles, and taken &s;o many towns? The&s;e
wicked men have, for a long time, expo&s;ed your Electoral Highne&s;s in
this manner." He tells his Electoral Highne&s;s that Charles V. vi&s;ited
Henry VIII. and that King William vi&s;ited the duke of Zell and his
Electoral Highne&s;s. That, &s;ince her Maje&s;ty has thought proper to di&s;|mi&s;s
her general, he a&s;ks, "if there is any one &s;o proper to command
the armies of the Queen and the Briti&s;h nation, as the prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or?
in which prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;or her Maje&s;ty and her people place
all their hopes," &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="206">
He pro&s;e&s;&s;es his attachment to the Electoral family, and entreats his
Electoral Highne&s;s to accept of the command of the army. He exclaims
again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the late mini&s;try; and &s;ays, that her Maje&s;ty had
ju&s;t rea&s;on to be offended with them: and he concludes, with praying
"God to pre&s;erve the per&s;on of your Electoral Highne&s;s, with your illu&s;|trious
family."</P>

about him, I thought it was my duty to pay my re&s;pects. He received
me with a great deal of polite attention, for you and for my&s;elf, and de|&s;ired

gave you &s;ome private advantages, you might hope for the &s;ame thing
from the new party, (in which he is deeply engaged). I an&s;wered, that
I did not believe the Whigs gave you any &s;uch advantages; that, if
it had been &s;o, I would have perceived &s;omething of it, and that you
had a ma&s;ter, who was alone capable of rewarding your &s;ervices. "I beg

de Robethon is, that he &s;hould act in concert with the new party in
favour of the family of Hannover." This appeared to me, to have been
&s;ugge&s;ted to him, by Mr. St. John, the new &s;ecretary of &s;tate, with
whom I find he is &s;o much connected, that I have little doubt, but he
will be &s;ent back to Switzerland. I replied, that you would always do
your be&s;t, to &s;upport the intere&s;t of the Elector, and to &s;hew, that the
new party was well thought of at your court. I went to my clo&s;et
for your o&s;ten&s;ible letter, which I read to him all from the beginning,
without giving him a copy of it. This made an impre&s;&s;ion, and I doubt
not, but Mr. St. John was regaled that very evening, with what he had
<PB N="201" REF="216">
retained of it. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of our conver&s;ation. Perhaps
Mon&s;ieur de Hervart informed you of all this in the letter which he
wrote you. He told me, that he had likewi&s;e &s;een your cou&s;in. They
do not choo&s;e to di&s;oblige you, as you &s;ee. He a&s;&s;ured me, that my
lord Rivers was very well &s;atisfied with you; and what is more, for your
court, although the public concludes the contrary, from his returning
without a pre&s;ent. The baron de Bothmar is expected every day. I wi&s;h

name &s;hortly, the mini&s;ter whom &s;he is to &s;end to his Electoral High|ne&s;s.
I hope that you will be plea&s;ed with him, and I doubt not, but

<PB N="203" REF="218">
But it is not po&s;&s;ible for the Whigs to abandon the Revolution. They
advanced the late King to the throne, and they are obliged to defend
his title. Now, they advanced him then in preference to the Queen who
now reigns, although &s;he was nearer, and a prote&s;tant. As this could
not be done but by the authority of the parliament, it is natural for the
Whigs to defend that authority, and the parliamentary right to the
crown; for otherwi&s;e, they would declare them&s;elves traitors and rebels.
And as the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Hannoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is a con&s;equence
of the Revolution, and a work of the late King, your court &s;hould take it
well of the Whigs, that they defend the Revolution, and &s;hould excu&s;e &s;ome
expre&s;&s;ions in their la&s;t writings, which appear to carry too far the au|thority
of the parliament in the affair of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and the more &s;o,
that the maxims of the Tories tending directly to prepare the way for the
prince of Wales, and to &s;ecure his title from being called in que&s;tion;
it is natural for the friends of the Hannoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to maintain a
contrary doctrine. The baron de Bothmar is expected impatiently, in

that he is very &s;en&s;ible of this, and has a very great e&s;teem and regard

<P>His Electoral Highne&s;s approves much of my having the honour of
writing to you, when Mr. Bothmar &s;hall be ab&s;ent from London, and
bu&s;ine&s;s worthy of your attention &s;hall offer. But during the re&s;idence

&s;ince he has the entire confidence of his Electoral Highne&s;s, and is per|fectly

very u&s;ele&s;s; and would but only weary you by the repetition of things,
which Mr. Bothmar will not fail to repre&s;ent to you verbally, much bet|ter

now, that they hope here, you will be plea&s;ed to give Mr. Bothmar

any other protection here, but their character. But with regard to the ren|dering

always to be judged by the laws of the land, and &s;uch a declaration
would be the be&s;t means to &s;uppre&s;s in&s;olence and parties.</P>
<P>But now as to the high-church.</P>
<P>There are 9600 pari&s;hes in England, and con&s;equently &s;o many par&s;ons;
but their number may be at lea&s;t 2000 more, to &s;upply cures and who
&s;eek preferment.</P>
<P>Ten or fifteen of this number have made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to preach
that the church is in danger, though the church enjoys all the privileges
that the law does allow them; but the clergymen in England would have
the &s;ame power over the people, that the church of Rome had in the
time of its dominion over us.</P>
<P>The Queen and parliament have now declared, that they will maintain
the church as e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; &s;o that they will not gain any thing by
their noi&s;e, only this mini&s;try have blown them up to recommend them
and their party, to govern the helm, which point they have gained, and
the poor ambitious prie&s;ts will be left in the lurch.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts handle edged tools, which any prince may cut them with,
when he plea&s;es; for the laws are &s;o &s;evere again&s;t their encroachments,
that they are in danger of trea&s;on or premunire upon the lea&s;t fault; and
the civil government hath been &s;o jealous of their impertinence, that the
convocation of the clergy, cannot do any thing but by commi&s;&s;ion from
the King or Queen, and they cannot debate upon or re&s;olve any point,
but &s;uch as are permitted in their commi&s;&s;ion; and which re&s;olved, they
are not valid, unle&s;s the Queen approves them.</P>
<P>So that you &s;ee our church is limited by law. I think it good, in its
con&s;titution and doctrine; but &s;hall never encourage or con&s;ent to the
pride, ambition, and dominion of <HI>pri&s;ts,</HI> which hath occa&s;ioned &s;o much
blood-&s;hed in the world in all ages.</P>
<P>Sir, I a&s;k your pardon for writing you &s;o long a letter, but my thought
&s;ugge&s;ted it to me, with a re&s;pect and good intention towards you. If
any of them may be thought by you &s;erviceable to his Electoral High|ne&s;s,

the King of England had landed the la&s;t time in Scotland, he would have
infallibly &s;ucceeded; and the conjuncture appears, at pre&s;ent, &s;till more
favourable than it was then. The inclination of the Scots towards their
King appears vi&s;ible, in their &s;ending, as members to parliament, the
&s;ame men who had been brought pri&s;oners to London on account of the
inva&s;ion; and I can a&s;&s;ure, that the&s;e men have not changed their &s;enti|ments.
The pre&s;byterians in Scotland oppo&s;ed the elections as much as
they could, and their mini&s;ters preached again&s;t them; but in vain; for
the&s;e members were cho&s;en in &s;pite of them, by a great majority of
voices.</P>
<P>At the time of the la&s;t expedition to Scotland, men ran in crowds,
and with &s;o great eagerne&s;s, to withdraw their &s;tock out of the Bank, that
the commons were obliged to pa&s;s a law declaring all tho&s;e to be enemies
to the government and to the nation, who &s;hould demand their money
from the Bank, at that time; but, in&s;tead of curing the evil thereby,
they increa&s;ed the di&s;content; every one exclaiming, that it was cruel to
treat, as enemies to the &s;tate, tho&s;e who called for their money when they
had occa&s;ion for it; and, if news had not come, that the King of Eng|land
had returned to France with the fleet, in twelve hours later the Bank
would have been &s;hut up. This is well known to all tho&s;e who were
then in London, and is known throughout all England, in&s;omuch, that,
&s;ince that time, the credit of the Bank is greatly dimini&s;hed. Not long
ago, the news of the failing of 13 or 14 privateers from Dunkirk gave
the alarm in England, that the Pretender was coming; upon which, &s;e|verals,
<PB N="212" REF="227">
with &s;ome of whom I am acquainted, ran immediately to the Bank
to demand their money; and there is no doubt, but the &s;ame thing will
happen univer&s;ally, whenever there is a real inva&s;ion. All the funds
will fail: no tax will be paid, but what is rai&s;ed by force: no one will
choo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e to advance money upon the &s;ecurity of the funds; and without it,
it will be impo&s;&s;ible to make new preparations for oppo&s;ing the inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>If the Bank of England fails, I believe there is no doubt, that the
Confederates will not be able to &s;upport the war, and then his mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty will have a &s;afe game to play, without running any
ri&s;k. Troops are daily draughted, to be &s;ent out of the kingdom; &s;o
that few will be left to make oppo&s;ition, and there are &s;everals in the
army who have di&s;covered their di&s;po&s;itions of returning to their duty
towards their King, if they found the opportunity.</P>
<P>They are preparing fleets to be &s;ent to the Mediterranean and el&s;e|where;
&s;o that the few &s;hips, which will remain to guard the channel,
cannot hinder the pa&s;&s;age from Bre&s;t to Kirkcudbright; e&s;pecially, if an
alarm is given from Dunkirk and other ports. All the fleet of England
can never hinder a &s;quadron to pa&s;s from Bre&s;t to Ireland; and Scotland
is only a little more di&s;tant in the &s;ame line.</P>
<P>Severals in England wi&s;h the King well, who would not hazard their
e&s;tates for him; but the&s;e very people would not willingly hazard any
thing again&s;t him, if they &s;aw the &s;malle&s;t ri&s;k on the &s;ide of the go|vernment.
It &s;eems, therefore, that the greate&s;t number want only an
opportunity of declaring them&s;elves; that is to &s;ay, the return of his
Britannic Maje&s;ty, with a force &s;ufficient to protect tho&s;e who would
choo&s;e to join him on his arrival. If he came with 10,000 men, it is
thought there would not be a &s;word drawn again&s;t him.; but if he can|not
have that number, 5000 men would render the &s;ucce&s;s probable,
but not &s;o certain.</P>
<P>It is generally thought, that the prince&s;s of Denmark is favourably
inclined towards the King her brother; and that &s;he would choo&s;e ra|ther
to have him for her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, than the prince of Hannover. But
&s;he is timid, and does not know to whom &s;he can give her confidence.
The duke of Leeds told me, that he had endeavoured to &s;ound her as
much as he could, upon this &s;ubject, and he is in her confidence, and has
free acce&s;s to her; but though &s;he never cho&s;e to explain her&s;elf upon
<PB N="213" REF="228">
this point, &s;he &s;ays nothing again&s;t him. It is thought, that if the King
of England was in Scotland, a treaty with him would be immediately
propo&s;ed, and then the members of parliament would be at liberty to
declare their &s;entiments; whereas, they are now re&s;trained by an act
of parliament, which declares all tho&s;e guilty of high trea&s;on, who &s;hall
oppo&s;e the Hannoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by word or by writing. But the
King of England being in Scotland, and all the kingdom acknowledg|ing
him, which could not fail to happen &s;oon after his arrival in that
country, then the pre&s;ent ncce&s;&s;ity, and the common good of the nation,
would authori&s;e the liberty, which each might take, of propo&s;ing what|ever
could prevent the fatal effects of a civil war. I am well a&s;&s;ured,
that &s;ome members of parliament would &s;peak boldly in that ca&s;e; and
I have al&s;o rea&s;on to believe, that there are &s;everal others, who only want
a &s;imilar conjuncture for declaring them&s;elves, and who would do it cor|dially:
and there is &s;carcely any doubt, but the greate&s;t number would
be for a treaty. Tho&s;e who would oppo&s;e it, would not render them&s;elves
popular, and might be con&s;idered as the enemies of the peace and &s;ettle|ment
of the nation; and the very rumour of the treaty, would make the
people con&s;ider the King as already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and as the ri&s;ing &s;un.
I believe there is no example in our hi&s;tory, that the lawful heir has been
admitted to a treaty, when his right was not acknowledged; as in the
ca&s;e of Stephen and Henry II.; of Richard duke of York, and of Henry
VI. &amp;c.: and the prince&s;s of Denmark having no children, would ren|der
the affair &s;till more ea&s;y, both with regard to her&s;elf and with regard
to the people.</P>
<P>The Arch-duke had none of the&s;e motives to encourage his enterpri&s;e,
and was not a&s;&s;ured of having one miquilite for him, when he undertook
to make that diver&s;ion in Spain, which has continued for &s;o many years,
and is not yet fini&s;hed. The diver&s;ion of the malecontents in Hungary
has been of con&s;iderable advantage to France; and it was by marching
into Saxony, that the King of Sweden obliged King Augu&s;tus to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>The &s;malle&s;t advantage which an expedition of the King of England
into Scotland could produce, would be a civil war; which might be
&s;upported from time to time by France, even though none of his Ma|je&s;ty's
&s;ubjects &s;hould join him: but that is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed: for in the
divi&s;ions of parties, there are now malecontents enough in Great Britain,
<PB N="214" REF="229">
who would rejoice at that opportunity of joining him, be&s;ides &s;o many
others in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, or on bad terms with the government,
whom fear, re&s;entment, or hope would influence; and there are men of
that character, in every country, but no where &s;o many as there are at
pre&s;ent in Great Britain. But it is certain that the greate&s;t number of the
Scots are di&s;po&s;ed to join their King from inclination, and from a
principle of loyalty. This is evident, from all that they have &s;uffered,
with &s;o much con&s;tancy, for above two and twenty years; and that there
is a con&s;iderable number of them, appears from the apprehen&s;ions the
government entertain of them, and the mea&s;ures they take to apprehend
the leaders on every alarm. But there are, be&s;ides, a &s;et of men, well|di&s;po&s;ed,
who have taken the oaths to the government only by form,
and from intere&s;t, and whom general Stanhope, in Sacheverel's trial,
calls the nonjuror-&s;wearers. The&s;e are very numerous in the two king|doms.
There is not a high-church man in England that is not &s;u&s;pected
by the government. This is the ca&s;e with all tho&s;e who have pre&s;ented
addre&s;&s;es for maintaining hereditary right and the maxim of the church
of England, that a prince is never to be re&s;i&s;ted; and the&s;e comprehend
almo&s;t the whole nation, excepting &s;uch as are Whigs or Pre&s;byterians
by profe&s;&s;ion; who, however, are become the contempt and aver&s;ion of
the people.</P>
<P>Malicious and injurious expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the King are no longer u&s;ed,
even by the Whigs, who dare not now expre&s;s them&s;elves as they did
formerly. They acknowledged his birth in Sacheverel's trial, in order
to de&s;troy hereditary right by that means, and to convince the prince&s;s
of Denmark, that &s;he has no other title to the crown, but the &s;ettlement
which has been made for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ince the Revolution; and the ge|nerality
&s;peak with e&s;teem and re&s;pect of the King's per&s;on.</P>
<P>I do not intend to conceal any thing. The only objection again&s;t the
King is his religion; but that is not imputed to him as a fault, but as
his misfortune and ours; and the people would endure him much more
willingly, if they did not believe him a bigot to his religion; and this
is the idea his enemies endeavour to give of him as much as they can.</P>
<P>To obviate this objection, the following means are judged u&s;eful, by
his Maje&s;ty's friends, who per&s;uade them&s;elves that he will be ready to
do, on his part, all that is lawful for him, to bring about his re&s;toration;
<PB N="215" REF="230">
and God forbid that more &s;hould be demanded of him, to gain even all
the kingdoms of the earth.</P>
<P>1&s;t, The King of England, therefore, mu&s;t not, either by word or by
in&s;inuation, give any rea&s;on to believe that he is capable of di&s;&s;embling
his religion. Every one would have a wor&s;e opinion of him, on that
account, and le&s;s credit would be given to all that he could &s;ay.</P>
<P>But, to remove the objection of bigotry and blind zeal, it is pro|po&s;ed
he &s;hould acquaint his &s;ubjects, that when it &s;hall plea&s;e God to
re&s;tore him to his kingdoms, and to give him a proper opportunity, he
will not refu&s;e to hear whatever can be &s;aid to him, with re&s;pect and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
in favour of the religion of his dominions. But whatever may
be the i&s;&s;ue of this, with regard to his Maje&s;ty's religion, that will not
dimini&s;h our loyalty and our entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him as our lawful &s;o|vereign.</P>
<P>It is not under&s;tood by this, that there is to be a public di&s;pute, which
is a &s;ort of combat of gladiators for victory, and which ends generally
in increa&s;ing the differences, and exa&s;perating the animo&s;ities, upon both
&s;ides; the pride of man having a natural aver&s;ion to appear to be con|vinced:
accordingly when rea&s;ons fail, pride &s;ummons all the pa&s;&s;ions
to its aid, and then the combat is carried on with bitterne&s;s, and with per|&s;onal
reflections, which produce a hatred that excludes all means of re|conciliation.</P>
<P>No, this is not pretended; it is propo&s;ed only, that his Britannic Ma|je&s;ty
&s;hould not refu&s;e to hear a rea&s;onable man, who will explain to him,
with all the deference and re&s;pect that is due to him, the principles of
the church of England; and that, afterwards, he &s;hould determine as
God and his con&s;cience will dictate to him; but, at the &s;ame time, he
&s;hould pre&s;erve to the church of England all legal &s;ecurities for its e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
and &s;upport.</P>
<P>2dly, It is propo&s;ed, in order to remove all &s;u&s;picion and prejudice
again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, that, when he comes over, he &s;hould bring no more
prie&s;ts along with him than he has occa&s;ion for. It is the intere&s;t of the
King of England, e&s;pecially on his arrival, to give the people advan|tageous
impre&s;&s;ions of him; afterwards things will be more ea&s;y. When
he is on the throne, and the people find that their religion, their liberty,
<PB N="216" REF="231">
and their fortunes arc &s;afe, he may then have as many prie&s;ts with him
as he plea&s;es, without being found fault with. So that it is only pro|po&s;ed
to deprive him&s;elf of &s;ome of them for a little time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pen is drawn through the la&s;t paragraph in the copy; probably to prevent giv|ing offence to the bigotry of Lewis XIV. for who&s;e peru&s;al the tran&s;lation of the memorial was intended.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3dly, If his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty would only connive at allowing
the Prote&s;tant dome&s;tics of the King of England to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves,
from time to time, at St. Germains, in order to wor&s;hip God in the mo&s;t
&s;ecret manner that po&s;&s;ibly could be, that would do more &s;ervice than
10,000 men. For, in England, that would appear as a &s;ort of toleration,
with regard to his attendants; and, being obtained by his Britanni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ma|je&s;ty,
every one would con&s;ider it as a mark of his inclination to favour
his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, and as a pledge of what they might expect from
him, when he was re&s;tored to his throne. Be&s;ides that, it would entirely
remove the objection of bigotry. If it could be &s;aid in England, that
the King has procured for the prote&s;tant &s;ervants who attend him, the
liberty which is here propo&s;ed for them, that would be half the way to
his re&s;toration. I only repeat here the very words which I have heard
from &s;en&s;ible men in London.</P>
<P>4thly, When the King of England comes, it will be proper to have in
his company &s;ome mini&s;ter of the church of England, who is of an
approved character, in order to preach to the people, as &s;oon as he lands,
without tru&s;ting to chance, and employing the fir&s;t whom he finds on the
place, and who may be either di&s;affected or incapable.</P>
<P>5thly, It is nece&s;&s;ary to bring along with him all the Iri&s;h troops,
who will be very agreeable to the Highlanders, becau&s;e they &s;peak the
&s;ame language; but, above all, to bring the duke of Berwick along with
him; for he is feared and loved, and his pre&s;ence will prevent all the
di&s;putes which may ari&s;e among the nobility of Scotland for the com|mand
of the army; for they will all &s;ubmit to him, and they all de&s;ire
that he may come.</P>
<P>Time pre&s;&s;es and appears &s;hort; for, according to all appearances,
the next winter will produce a peace, and then the King of England
mu&s;t be reduced to begin every thing a-new for bringing about his re|&s;toration,
and to &s;eek new and uncertain mea&s;ures to accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="232">
If the prince&s;s of Denmark, who is very infirm, dies, and if the
prince of Hannover is once in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he will bring along with him
his German troops, who, in virtue of the la&s;t act of parliament, will be
naturalized the moment they arrive; and he will humble and ruin all the
King of England's friends, and render, by the&s;e means, his cau&s;e de&s;perate."</P>
<P>[The pen is drawn through what follows.]</P>
<P>"If his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty is not in a condition now to furni&s;h
troops and other &s;uccours nece&s;&s;ary to the King of England, for an ex|pedition
into Scotland, may not &s;ome propo&s;als be made to the King of
Sweden? Will not that prince be very well plea&s;ed to have &s;uch an ally
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to obtain &s;atisfaction from the King of Denmark, and to
defend his coa&s;ts again&s;t the Mu&s;covites? And, in ca&s;e of a double
marriage, which might be propo&s;ed to him, he would have a chance of
&s;ucceeding to the crown of England, as the King of England would have
to that of Sweden. Their religion cannot be objected again&s;t the Swedes,
for the prince of Hannover is a Lutheran.</P>
<P>If his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty choo&s;es rather to land 5 or 10,000 men, to
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the King of Sweden, than to ri&s;k his troops and his &s;hips
on an expedition to Scotland, the King of Sweden might &s;end an equal
number of troops to Scotland much more ea&s;ily, becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;age is
much &s;horter; and con&s;idering that that prince is engaged in &s;itting out
con&s;iderable armaments, both by &s;ea and by land, again&s;t the Danes,
and again&s;t the Mu&s;covites, the real de&s;igns of his preparations will never
be &s;u&s;pected. He may be the more ea&s;ily reconciled to this, that the
government of England is not very favourably di&s;po&s;ed towards him, of
which his Swedi&s;h Maje&s;ty appears, by his la&s;t declaration, to be very
&s;en&s;ible; declaring war again&s;t them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and con&s;idering
them as the aggre&s;&s;ors, becau&s;e they engaged to maintain a neutrality in
the north of Germany: and nothing appears more natural, and more con|form
to the genius of that prince, than to enter into an alliance with the
King of England, who may write to him, by the means of the Swedi&s;h
re&s;ident, who is here, until he can &s;end a mini&s;ter to treat with him
Be&s;ides, that prince is guarantee of the peace of Ri&s;wick, and has a right
to intere&s;t him&s;elf in the pre&s;ent war; and, by an alliance with the King
of England, he might once more have the balance of Europe in his hands,
<PB N="218" REF="233">
and give a general peace upon rea&s;onable terms; and the&s;e two princes
thus allied, would be in a condition to maintain the peace again&s;t all
tho&s;e who would incline to di&s;turb it, and to prevent any rebellion that
might ari&s;e in their re&s;pective dominions."</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"SINCE you de&s;ire my opinion upon the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs of our
country, and that you a&s;&s;ure me I may, with all &s;afety, con&s;ide
my private thoughts to you, I &s;hall tell you here very plainly what I think
mo&s;t advi&s;eable in the pre&s;ent conjuncture.</P>
<P>I need not go about to prove, that the hou&s;e of Hannover and the
States of Holland are united with the Whigs and di&s;contented party of
England; again&s;t the Queen, her pre&s;ent mini&s;try, and the church of
England.</P>
<P>Their late proceedings have &s;ufficiently &s;hewn their inclinations that
way; and nothing is more obvious, than that the church and court party
can expect no quarter from the&s;e three united powers, if ever they come
to have the &s;uperiority. They think they have been very ill u&s;ed, and
after re&s;enting their pretended injuries &s;o publickly as they have done,
<PB N="219" REF="234">
it is not to be expected they will ever hardly pardon. 'Tis pretty plain
they are in a &s;ort of confederacy together, and that they are re&s;olved to
&s;tand and fall by one another. The duke of Hannover has, in con|junction
with the States, declared him&s;elf &s;o openly for the Whig party,
in oppo&s;ition to the Queen her&s;elf, as well as her mini&s;try, that it is
vi&s;ible he is in&s;eparably united to that party, and will always be influ|enced
by it; and that if ever he comes to have the power in his hands,
the church and pre&s;ent mini&s;try mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice to the Whigs' re|venge;
the breach being too wide to expect they can ever be thoroughly
reconciled.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, therefore, that as matters &s;tand now, there remains
only one expedient that can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ecure, at once, both the church and
&s;tate again&s;t any attempt that may be made to their prejudice, either
during the Queen's life, or after her death, by a powerful, ab&s;olute
prince, &s;upported by a jealous, intere&s;ted nation abroad, and animated
by an exa&s;perated, factious party at home; and that is to call home the
Queen's brother, who&s;e ju&s;t right gains ground daily in the hearts of his
&s;ubjects: in order to which, I think it not only advi&s;able, but ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;end to treat with him without lo&s;s of time; for all depends
upon taking timely mea&s;ures, it being of the la&s;t importance to the
court and country intere&s;t, as well as his, to be before-hand with their
common adver&s;aries. Accidents may happen; we are all mortal; and
if things be not prepared and &s;ecured before a vacancy, it will be very
hard, after that, to avoid a civil war: for we all know, that, according
to the laws now in being, Hannover, in that ca&s;e, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be
proclaimed King. It will be too late then to repeal tho&s;e laws which
make it high trea&s;on to oppo&s;e him; and it is not to be doubted but he
will quickly come over here, and bring with him (if it be nece&s;&s;ary)
all the force the Hollanders and he can draw together. On the other
hand, it is certain the King will not be wanting, on his &s;ide, to tran&s;port
him&s;elf, at any rate, into &s;ome part of his dominions, to join with
his friends, in order to a&s;&s;ert his right, and venture all, rather than have
the &s;hame and grief to &s;ee a foreign U&mdash;r take peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his lawful inheritance. This mu&s;t unavoidably produce a civil war,
which is, perhaps, what the Hollanders wi&s;h for; the fatal con&s;equences
of which may la&s;t and extend, nobody knows how far.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="235">
The only remedy I &s;ee to prevent the&s;e misfortunes, and &s;ave our na|tion

Maje&s;ty's brother, the King, and call him home privately upon the fir&s;t

rece&s;s of parliament, without the lea&s;t danger of di&s;turbance) tho&s;e very
per&s;ons, who would have oppo&s;ed him in parliament, and every where
el&s;e in his ab&s;ence, will be the fir&s;t to come and ki&s;s his hand when
he is here, and comply with whatever the Queen &s;hall think fit to do
in his favour.</P>
<P>It is &s;o vi&s;ibly the Queen's and the pre&s;ent mini&s;try's true intere&s;t to
call her only brother home, in this conjuncture, that he and they may
be a mutual &s;upport and &s;ecurity to one another, that I am morally a&s;|&s;ured
he will not make the lea&s;t difficulty to tru&s;t him&s;elf entirely into
their hands, whenever they plea&s;e to call him; and that he will be wil|ling
even to come over with a page only to accompany him, upon the
Queen his &s;i&s;ter's letter, if it be thought fit and nece&s;&s;ary for his and
their common intere&s;t &s;o to do: and when he is once here, I am &s;ure
nobody will dare to find fault with the Queen's receiving him kindly.
She may &s;afely pre&s;ent him to her council, own him there for her bro|ther,
<PB N="221" REF="236">
and declare her good intentions towards him, and what &s;he has
thought fit, with the advice of her mini&s;ters, to treat and concert with
him, for the future good and peace of her kingdoms. After which &s;tep
it will be infinitely more ea&s;y and le&s;s hazardous by any other method
what&s;oever, to get the pre&s;ent &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion altered, in the
next meeting of the parliament, and every thing regulated there to their
mutual &s;atisfaction; and all the rights and privileges of church and &s;tate,
crown, parliament, and people &s;ettled again upon the &s;olid foundation of
the ancient laws and con&s;titution of the kingdom.</P>
<P>But to a&s;&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of this great work, I think it ab&s;olutely be&s;t,
when he is invited over, that he be allowed to come &s;traight to London,
where his &s;udden and unexpected appearance will &s;urpri&s;e and confound
all his unprepared enemies, break all their mea&s;ures, and make every
thing go &s;o quick and ea&s;y on the Queen's &s;ide and his, that they will
&s;oon, by the wi&s;e conduct of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, put it out of the
power of either Hannover or the di&s;contented Whigs to di&s;turb the new
&s;ettlement that &s;hall be agreed upon, between the brother and his now
only &s;i&s;ter. But, in ca&s;e things be not thought ripe enough, or &s;uffi|ciently
di&s;po&s;ed to bring him &s;traight to London, the next be&s;t will be
to bring him to Scotland; which would be better by far, than &s;ending
him a travelling into foreign countries. Only one thing is to be ob|&s;erved,
as to Scotland, that the government of the church there being
Pre&s;byterian, and the generality of that nation being di&s;contented with
the Union, which we in England think our intere&s;t to maintain, he may,
perhaps, have &s;ome hard propo&s;als made to him upon that head, by a
prevalent party in that kingdom, which will make him very unea&s;y, by
putting a di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity upon him of refu&s;ing what he cannot
grant to them, without di&s;obliging the Engli&s;h, which I have good
rea&s;on to be believe he is re&s;olved not to do; it being contrary to his in|clination,
as well as his intere&s;t, to do any thing in favour of one nation,
that may be a ju&s;t ground of grievance to another; his intention, as I
am credibly informed, being to leave all tho&s;e matters of &s;tate, as well
as of religion, to be entirely decided and &s;ettled in a Briti&s;h parliament.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have (in compliance to your de&s;ire) opened my mind
freely to you upon a very nice point. I hope, from your friend&s;hip for
me, and your known di&s;cretion in matters of this importance, that you
<PB N="222" REF="237">
will not communicate this paper, but where you are &s;ure it will be &s;afe,
and where you have rea&s;on to hope it may be of &s;ome u&s;e. I &s;hall con|clude
with a&s;&s;uring you, that you are the only per&s;on to whom it is &s;ent,
and that neither the per&s;on by who&s;e conveyance it comes, nor any other
per&s;on whatever on your &s;ide, knows any thing of the contents of it.
Any thing that tends towards Jacobiti&s;m (as I own this letter does) &s;ounds
ill in the ears of tho&s;e who are always u&s;ed to tack popery, &s;lavery, and
arbitrary government together; and have no other notion of a popi&s;h
King, but that of a bigot tyrant. But I, who know from unque&s;tion|able
hands, that the Pretender (as we call him here) be&s;ides his other
great and good qualities, is too wi&s;e and too ju&s;t a prince to think of per|&s;ecuting
any body for his religion; that, on the contrary, all tho&s;e of
our church, that are about him at pre&s;ent, have di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of
his bounty &s;hewn to them, with a&s;&s;urances that it &s;hall not be his fault
if they have not the full exerci&s;e of their religion whenever they go with
him. I, who know al&s;o, that he has &s;ent particular directions to his
friends here, to join them&s;elves unanimou&s;ly to vote for and &s;upport the
mea&s;ures of the court and pre&s;ent mini&s;try, with all the intere&s;t they
have, am not only fully per&s;uaded of his true affection for his &s;i&s;ter, and
love for his country, but am al&s;o convinced, in my con&s;cience, that our
e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, as well as our liberties, e&s;tates, and employments,
and every thing el&s;e that is dear to us, will be infinitely more &s;ecure un|der
his government, than under a Lutheran foreign prince, influenced
by German and Whig coun&s;els: and, therefore, to you I am not afraid
nor a&s;hamed to own my&s;elf, &s;o far a Jacobite as to wi&s;h a good under|&s;tanding
between our gracious Queen and her brother, which I look upon
to be the only means to make her Maje&s;ty happy, ea&s;y, and &s;afe, as long
as &s;he lives, our pre&s;ent mini&s;try out of danger of being ever oppre&s;&s;ed
by their enemies, our church &s;afe, and our country happy. To be a
Jacobite, at this rate, in my opinion, is to be a true patriot and a faithful
&s;ubject; and I hope you do me the ju&s;tice to have no other opinion of,
Sir, &amp;c.</P>

<P>"THE violence and ambition of the enemies of our family, and of

the obligations of nature and duty, ought to be more firmly united;
and have hindered us from the proper means and endeavours of a
better under&s;tanding between us, which could not fail to produce the
mo&s;t happy effects to our&s;elves, to our family, and to our bleeding
country.</P>
<P>But whatever the &s;ucce&s;s may be, I have re&s;olved now to break
through all re&s;erve, and to be the fir&s;t in an endeavour &s;o ju&s;t and nece&s;|&s;ary.
The natural affection I bear you, and that the King our father
had for you, till his la&s;t breath; the con&s;ideration of our mutual in|tere&s;t,
honour, and &s;afety, and the duty I owe to God and my country,
are the true motives that per&s;uade me to write to you, and to do all
that is po&s;&s;ible for me to come to a perfect union with you.</P>
<P>And you may be a&s;&s;ured, Madam, that though I can never abandon,
but with my life, my own ju&s;t right, which you know is unalterably
&s;ettled by the mo&s;t fundamental laws of the land; yet I am mo&s;t de|&s;irous
rather to owe to you, than to any living, the recovery of it. It
is for your&s;elf that a work &s;o ju&s;t and glorious is re&s;erved. The voice
of God and nature calls you to it; the promi&s;es you made to the King
our father enjoin it; the pre&s;ervation of our family, the preventing of
unnatural wars require it; and the public good and welfare of our
country recommend it to you, to re&s;cue it from pre&s;ent and future evils;
which mu&s;t, to the late&s;t po&s;terity, involve the nation in blood and con|fu&s;ion,

<P><PB N="224" REF="239">

of another language, of another intere&s;t, and who, by the ge|neral
naturalization, may bring over crowds of his countrymen to &s;upply
the defect of his right, and en&s;lave the nation.</P>
<P>In the meantime, I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, and am ready to give all the
&s;ecurity that can be de&s;ired, that it is my unalterable re&s;olution to make
the law of the land the rule of my government, to pre&s;erve every man's

to &s;ecure and maintain tho&s;e of the church of England, in all their ju&s;t
rights and privileges, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; and to grant &s;uch a tolera|tion

no rea&s;onable terms of accommodation which you can de&s;ire for your&s;elf,

me; for by that way only, things can be adju&s;ted to our mutual &s;ati&s;|faction,
which &s;hall be managed on our &s;ide with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>I have made this fir&s;t &s;tep towards our mutual happine&s;s, with a true
brotherly affection, with the plainne&s;s and &s;incerity that becomes both
our rank and relation, and in the mo&s;t prudent manner I could at pre|&s;ent
contrive; and will be directed by you in the pro&s;ecution of it, rely|ing
entirely on your knowledge and experience, as to the means and

<P>"IN an&s;wer to yours, I cannot, at this di&s;tance, and in my pre&s;ent
circum&s;tances, enter into di&s;putes of religion; but tho&s;e of the
church of England have no rea&s;on to doubt of my favour and protection,
after the early a&s;&s;urances I gave them in my in&s;tructions, bearing date
the 3d March, 1702, which you have &s;een, and I am re&s;olved to make
good. I know my grand-father and my father too had always a good
opinion of the principles of the church of England relating to monarchy;
and experience &s;ufficiently &s;heweth, that the crown was never &s;truck at
but &s;he al&s;o felt the blow; and though &s;ome of her chief profe&s;&s;ors have
failed in their duty, we mu&s;t not mea&s;ure the principles of a church by
the actions of &s;ome particulars.</P>
<P>Plain dealing is be&s;t in all things, e&s;pecially in matters of religion;
and, as I am re&s;olved never to di&s;&s;emble in religion, &s;o I &s;hall never
tempt others to do it; and as well as I am &s;atisfied of the truth of my
own religion, yet I &s;hall never look wor&s;e upon any per&s;ons, becau&s;e in
this they chance to differ with me: nor &s;hall I refu&s;e, in due time and

not take it ill if I u&s;e the &s;ame liberty I allow to others, to adhere to the
religion which I, in my con&s;cience, think the be&s;t; and I may rea&s;on|ably

<P>"I Have been away the&s;e two months &s;ince I writ my la&s;t to you, and

to &s;ee me. But at this gentleman's return, I not being arrived, he ne|glected
to &s;end any more to our hou&s;e, and I had like to have lo&s;t the

to know more in particular his de&s;ires, and where I might wait
upon him, who immediately an&s;wered me, as from his ma&s;ter, and fixed

fail of coming to a happy i&s;&s;ue: nay, that both &s;ides would &s;ee an ab&s;o|lute
nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to him, as the only means left of &s;ecur|ing
&s;olid peace and happine&s;s: not &s;o much, perchance, (either Mr.
Robert [High Church] or cou&s;in. Simon [Whigs]) out of any true prin|ciples
of con&s;cience or hone&s;ty, for he does not think either de&s;erves the
name of Lum&s;dell [Loyal].</P>
<P>As to Mr. Antony's [the King's] bu&s;ine&s;s, it mu&s;t be managed with
a great deal of dexterity. He was not a little &s;tartled at the news of his
going to Mr. Price [the Pope]; it would not have been well at all. He
&s;ays, when they begin to work at Povey [peace], perchance Mr. Ed|ward
[King of France] and his Fredlingers [mini&s;ters], (who will be wil|ling
to con&s;ecrate any thing to their own ends) will be con&s;enting to Mr.
Athony's [the King's] going to live &s;ome where with Mr. Price [the
Pope], or &s;ome where in that country, and he fancies that &s;omething of
that kind may be in&s;i&s;ted upon by others in Evans [England]; by that
means to per&s;uade the tenants that they are altogether for excluding the
Thomi&s;ts [Catholics], and all for Gregory (Hannover]. "But he de|clares,
as much as he can judge of things, that Mr. Athony's [the King's]
<PB N="230" REF="245">
going thither mu&s;t never be granted to." And this he looks upon as a
point of the la&s;t importance; for he declares, he thinks it ab&s;olutely
contrary to Mr. Athony's intere&s;t; and, therefore, though Mr. Edward
[King of France] &s;hould con&s;ent to it, and people in Evans [England]
pu&s;h for it, it mu&s;t not be done: and he de&s;ired me in particular to a&s;&s;ure
you of this, (and he &s;wore it by the living God) that he thought, that
if Mr. Benjamin [the Queen] ever con&s;ented to this, that 'twas no better
than ruining and quite murdering this &s;on's, the Grot's [King's] cau&s;e.
If it be nece&s;&s;ary, or judged advantageous to quit For&s;ter [France], let
him go to his uncle David [Germany], or rather have recour&s;e to &s;ome
free &s;eat. But I a&s;ked him, what &s;ecurity for his per&s;on, there being
&s;uch a writ out again&s;t him? He an&s;wered, he really did not think he
wanted any &s;ecurity, for nobody would touch him. "As for his part,
he had &s;een &s;uch vi&s;ible changes for the better of late, on all &s;ides, that
he thought the gaining of his cau&s;e could not but follow." And when
he gets his e&s;tate, he hopes he will make his tenants ea&s;y; and not think|ing
of annulling any regulations, made for the cutting down woods, and
altering other farms, for the&s;e many years; for that will bring dangerous
con&s;equences, the intere&s;t of &s;o many per&s;ons being engaged, who other|wi&s;e
would come in to him.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Betty's deed [the Queen's jointure] is in&s;i&s;ted upon, if it
was to be put to Philip Cook [the parliament], you will find many, he is
per&s;uaded, even willing to help it on, and glad of an occa&s;ion of making
their compliments <HI>&agrave; bon grace,</HI> and giving &s;ome te&s;timony of their good|will.
If &s;he thinks, that he &s;hall be in any capacity of &s;erving her in this
point, &s;he needs only to &s;ignify to him what &s;he expects from him, and
he will be very glad of the occa&s;ion of &s;howing him&s;elf her humble
&s;ervant. He in&s;inuated a de&s;ire you &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible, that what he has
done for the&s;e many years, (and &s;eem to affirm the &s;ame of others) has
not been out of any &s;pleen or ill-will again&s;t you, but only to put down
Fo&s;ter [France], which he always judged the true intere&s;t of Mrs.
Edwards [England], who&s;e cau&s;e alone he pleaded for. He thinks
certainly there will be an accommodation; for when he was, la&s;t winter,
at Mrs. Evans [England], he &s;aw &s;o much of the di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple,
that if all were to be polled, nine in ten would ab&s;olutely vote
for Povey [peace], being &s;pent, on all &s;ides, by &s;o long a law-&s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="246">
A great many, he &s;ays, have taken &s;trange methods, of late, which,
contrary to the intentions of tho&s;e that made u&s;e of them, will prove very
much to the advantage of Mr. Andrew's [the King's] cau&s;e; and God,
who rules above, &s;eems vi&s;ibly to di&s;po&s;e all things for the be&s;t. Neither
your cou&s;in Temple, [the Tories] nor Wil&s;on [the Whigs] are much to
be relyed on, quatenus &s;uch; but all that they have or &s;eem to be
a doing, will in&s;en&s;ibly reduce both of them, more and more, to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of doing Mr. Athony's [the King's] bu&s;ine&s;s, and even calling for
him.</P>
<P>To &s;ignify the&s;e things to you, was the rea&s;on of his calling for me,
and he de&s;ired I would tike an occa&s;ion of waiting upon you for this in|tent;
but I hope the writing this will &s;uffice; if not, you know where
to command. After my compliments to him, I told him, as to my&s;elf,
I was much more afraid of the i&s;&s;ue of his &s;uits, in this following &s;ea|&s;on,
than in the former. He owned, he had been treated unworthily,
upon &s;everal accounts: but that was nothing. For his part, God had
ble&s;&s;ed him with a great deal of temper, and he had taken the re&s;olution
of being quiet for the pre&s;ent; but he would expect his time; and if
Mr. Matthew [Harley] or others pu&s;hed things to greater extremities,
they &s;hould give him, perchance, only better hold, and they &s;hould find
what metal he was made of.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired, that his compliments might be made, in a particular
manner, to Mr. Barker [Berwick] and Mr. Wal. [E. Midd.] and bade
me tell the latter, that he hoped Mr. Wal. [E. Midd.] would live to &s;ee
better times, and more according to his &s;atisfaction. He was plea&s;ed to
a&s;k me many que&s;tions about Mr. Walter's [E. Midd.'s] conver&s;ion; and
&s;aid, he had heard, at the beginning, as if he had had a mind of retiring
from bu&s;ine&s;s, for good and all. As for his conver&s;ion, I told him,
it was beyond all doubt, truly &s;olid, and certainly upon motives alto|gether
chri&s;tian; and for the rumour of his having a mind to retire,
perchance, his retiring to our little &s;eminary, at Onk&s;i [Paris], might
give occa&s;ion of that rumour; but this was only to do his work he had
undertaken more efficaciou&s;ly, and fir&s;t clean&s;e the garden of &s;o many
weeds that had overrun it, and &s;econdly plant the &s;ame, with nece&s;&s;ary
adornments. (I think he an&s;wered, it is what we mu&s;t all come to; but
I did not under&s;tand him perfectly).</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="247">
As for the working at Povey [peace], he thought they had taken all
their mea&s;ures to do the bu&s;ine&s;s without him; and as for his part, he
de&s;ired nothing more than to be at quiet. Some bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ettle mat|ters
abroad, would detain him yet a little while, at Mr. Harri&s;on's
[Holland]; but when that was done, he would ha&s;ten home, where he
would maintain him&s;elf again&s;t them all; and if Mr. Mathews [Harley]
or others pu&s;hed matters any farther again&s;t him, perchance &s;o much
the better.</P>
<P>But, after he had u&s;ed a great many compliments, &amp;c. towards you, I
thought it would not be ami&s;s, civilly to urge him to &s;omething more
po&s;itive, and endeavour to &s;ee if there were any more &s;olid a&s;&s;urances to
be had from him, above what one might call a compliment; and for the
purpo&s;e, I objected this to him, that &s;ome might &s;ay, he being a lawyer
of &s;uch intere&s;t, why would not he &s;tickle more in Mr. Anthony [the
King] and Barnard's [the Queen's] &s;uits? He an&s;wered, he did not
know what he could do directly in the matter; but only by managing
people &s;o, on occa&s;ions, as to make them enter into the afore&s;aid inter|e&s;ts;
and they might a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, nothing &s;hould be wanting on
his &s;ide, as occa&s;ions &s;hould pre&s;ent. He owned, indeed, that he had
acted with a great deal of animo&s;ity again&s;t Fo&s;ter [France], (and he
always thought it the intere&s;t of his country &s;o to do) but not again&s;t
them; and really &s;eemed to &s;hew a great de&s;ire of all things pro&s;pering
with you, and &s;aid, that God Almighty had di&s;po&s;ed things &s;o, that he
&s;olemnly &s;wore again, that he thought Mr. Anthony's [the King's] bu|&s;ine&s;s
could not fail of going forward, and that his Rode [religion] would
not be any hinderance to it, for all the prote&s;tations Evans [England]
had made to the contrary. He &s;ays, he knows your cou&s;in Harry
[prince&s;s of Denmark] perfectly well; that he is a very hone&s;t per&s;on,
but ea&s;ily won and wrought upon; but, at the bottom, he certainly has
no aver&s;ion from his brother Alexander [the King]. But he [prince&s;s
Anne] is one that mu&s;t not be frightened; and the lawyer [Churchill]
&s;ays, he thinks any extern force u&s;ed, will rather do more harm than
good, both in regard of Harry [prince&s;s Anne] and others. Whereas,
if one will but let things go on their own train, Alexander [the King's]
bu&s;ine&s;s will go on of it&s;elf, and he does not doubt, but will come to
a happy conclu&s;ion.</P>

<P>"IT would be proper to &s;how the Engli&s;h, that the monarchy and the
hierarchy, having &s;uch a clo&s;e connexion, and &s;o much dependence
the one upon the other; the one cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the other,
as might be ea&s;ily &s;hown, by arguments and examples. A King mu&s;t en|tirely
neglect his own intere&s;ts, when he does not protect and maintain
<PB N="235" REF="250">
the church of England,<MILESTONE N="December." UNIT="month"> in all its rights and privileges; and, therefore,
as there is not a &s;tronger tye than common intere&s;t, the members of that
church may be &s;ure, that the King will never depart from the &s;olemn
promi&s;es which he hath already made to them, and which he is ready to
confirm to them, that he will protect and maintain them, in the peace|ful
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their rights, privileges, and immunities, which have
been granted to them by acts of parliament and the common law of the
kingdom.</P>
<P>And, in order to remove all their unea&s;ine&s;s on the article of religion,
it may be &s;hown to them, that, in the year 1702, the King having been
informed, by men of rank of the church of England, that, in order to
render their religion perfectly &s;ecure under a Catholic King, they wi&s;hed
that his Maje&s;ty would grant them certain privileges, even beyond what
the acts of parliament and common law of the kingdom allow them;
his Maje&s;ty having examined their demands, granted them immediately,
although they could not deny them&s;elves, but by granting them, he de|rogated
from the rights and prerogatives of the crown."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Then follows a copy of the declaration.</P>
<P><Q>"It appears plainly then, to any one who will reflect, that it is the in|tere&s;t
of the Engli&s;h nation to fini&s;h, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, all di&s;putes about
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, by re-e&s;tabli&s;hing it in the right line; and
it appears likewi&s;e, that the catholic religion, which is the only thing
that can be objected to the King, is of no prejudice to them, but, on
the contrary, an advantage, as his Maje&s;ty yields to the church of Eng|land,
what no Prote&s;tant King would yield to them; therefore, the
members of that church will find their account, and have their pri|vileges
more enlarged, and their &s;ecurities better e&s;tabli&s;hed under the
King, being a catholic, than if he was a prote&s;tant."</Q></P>
<P>After propo&s;ing, in the very words of the <HI>Sieur Lamb,</HI> that is, doctor
Le&s;lie, that the act of &s;ettlement &s;hould be repealed, that every one
might be at liberty to declare his &s;entiments, the Memoriali&s;t proceeds.</P>
<Q><P>"After the act, which exchanged the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hall be repealed,
it would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end over the King to England, that he might
learn what is nece&s;&s;ary for him to know, in order to govern his people,
by in&s;tructing him&s;elf in the laws and cu&s;toms of the country; and like|wi&s;e,
<PB N="236" REF="251">
that he might be before-hand with the Dutch, who might other|wi&s;e,
upon the fir&s;t news of the death of the reigning prince&s;s, tran&s;port
thither the prince of Hannover, which would infallibly produce a civil
war, with which they would be very well plea&s;ed, becau&s;e they would
find their account in it. Moreover, they know that the prince of Han|nover,
who has not the be&s;t title on his &s;ide, will &s;tand in need of a
foreign &s;upport to maintain him; and, as he cannot find it any where but
with them, they will by that dependence, rea&s;&s;ume the direction of all
the affairs of England, as they did during the government of the prince
of Orange, which will nowi&s;e &s;uit either the humours or the intere&s;ts of
the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>When the King would be tran&s;ported to England, the be&s;t means of
&s;ecuring to him the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would be to treat him as a &s;overeign, in
which, it does not appear, there would be any inconveniency to the
reigning prince&s;s; who, for a&s;&s;ociating her brother to the royal title,
will not the le&s;s peaceably enjoy all her authority, during her own life;
as it has been &s;een lately, that the kingdom was governed peaceably, un|der
the names of William and Mary, although the fir&s;t had all the admini|&s;tration;
and as it was &s;een formerly, that the &s;ame kingdom was go|verned

to the government of England, without her being obliged to &s;ign any

<P><MILESTONE N="1711" UNIT="year"> TO explain the papers of the family of Hannover, in the pre&s;ent
year, a &s;hort detail of leading facts may be nece&s;&s;ary. The baron
de Bothmar, envoy extraordinary from the Elector, arrived in London,
early this year. Though the duke of Marlborough was permitted to re|tain
the command of the army, the dutche&s;s was deprived of all her
employments; and Harley, at the de&s;ire of the Queen, informed the
court of Hannover of her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. The Electoral Prince, who had
been elected a Knight of the Garter in 1706, was in&s;talled at Wind&s;or in
December 1710; the lord Halifax &s;erving as his proxy. The earl of
Roche&s;ter, the Queen's maternal uncle, who, from his rank, abilities,
experience in bu&s;ine&s;s, and influence with the high-church party, was the
only rival of Harley, died &s;uddenly, in the May of the pre&s;ent year. A
fair field being left for Harley's ambition, he became lord-trea&s;urer, earl
of Oxford and Mortimer, and was con&s;idered as prime mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Marlborough, endeavouring to overcome his enemies in the cabinet by
the &s;plendour of his actions in the field, made various, but un&s;ucce&s;sful,
efforts to force the Mare&s;chal de Villars to a battle. He, however, by a
&s;udden exertion, &s;urpri&s;ed the famous lines with which the French had
joined the Scheld, the San&s;ette, the Scarpe, and the Ugy. The con&s;e|quence

the crown of Great Britain &s;hould be &s;ecured in the treaty. The earl of
Oxford and his a&s;&s;ociates made the &s;ame a&s;&s;urances, in vain; the jealou&s;y
of his Electoral Highne&s;s having been rai&s;ed by the emi&s;&s;aries of the
Whigs.</P>
<P>The lord Raby, who had been appointed, in the preceding March,
amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the States-general, was created earl of Straf|ford
in the beginning of September, and in the end of that month was
&s;ent back to Holland, to pre&s;s the opening of a general congre&s;s. The
privy-&s;eal, upon the death of the duke of Newca&s;tle, was delivered into
the cu&s;tody of Dr. Robin&s;on, bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, who was intended to be
joined as plenipotentiary to the earl of Strafford, on the expected con|gre&s;s.
Doctor Swift gives the character of both very ju&s;tly, in a few
words. <Q REND="inline">"They were practiced in bu&s;ine&s;s, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no parts.
Strafford hath &s;ome life and &s;pirit; but is infinitely proud, and wholly

and Robin&s;on was a heavy, though decent man.</P>
<P>An incident, in Scotland, employed the attention of the court of Han|nover,
in the pre&s;ent year. The dutche&s;s of Gordon, a Roman Catholic,
pre&s;uming on the temper of the times, &s;ent a medal of the Pretender to
Mr. Robert Bennet, dean of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh.
This piece of &s;ilver had a legend upon it, importing that the kingdom
&s;hould be re&s;tored to the right owner. At a meeting of the Faculty,
thanks were voted to her Grace; and Mr. Robert Dundas of Arni&s;ton
returned them, in terms &s;ufficiently &s;editious and bold. He thanked
her for pre&s;enting them with a medal of their &s;overeign lord the King.
He hoped, that her Grace would &s;oon have an opportunity of pre&s;enting
to the faculty of Advocates a &s;econd medal, &s;truck upon the re&s;toration
of the King and royal family, and the fini&s;hing of rebellion, u&s;urpation,
tyranny, and whiggery. No inquiry was made into this affair, till the
baron de Kreyenberg, in the name of his ma&s;ter, the Elector, complained
of the conduct of the advocates to the Queen. In compliance with his
repre&s;entation, Sir David Dalrymple, the lord advocate, who was a
Whig, when it &s;uited with his own intere&s;t, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his of|fice,

<P>"BEING ready to embark, your Electoral Highne&s;s will be plea&s;ed

you have conde&s;cended to &s;hew me, and to a&s;&s;ure you, that I am firmly
re&s;olved to conform my&s;elf, in all re&s;pects, to the excellent advices your
Electoral Highne&s;s has been plea&s;ed to give me by Mon&s;ieur de Bulau.
Mon&s;ieur de Bothmar, who has been detained by contrary winds till
now, will be a witne&s;s of this, and will have the honour to &s;end infor|mation,
from time to time, of what pa&s;&s;es. I &s;hall apply my&s;elf to pro|mote
the Queen's intere&s;ts with the &s;ame zeal and a&s;&s;iduity I always did,
in order that I may have nothing to reproach my&s;elf with, in ca&s;e they
&s;hall choo&s;e that I &s;hould not continue in the &s;ervice, and I pre&s;ume to
hope that your Electoral Highne&s;s will do me ju&s;tice in that re&s;pect. I
mu&s;t not however conceal from you that my corre&s;pondents write to me,
that tho&s;e who have mo&s;t credit at pre&s;ent, are re&s;olved to embarra&s;s me,
by depriving me of officers and others in whom I place the mo&s;t confi|dence.
<PB N="241" REF="256">
You will be informed by your mini&s;ters here, that it has been
re&s;olved to take all po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ures for being in the field early next
year. For this purpo&s;e all the troops mu&s;t be complete on the 25th of
March, and magazines of forage will be formed on the frontiers. But the
principal &s;ubject of con&s;ideration was how to carry on the war in Spain
with the greate&s;t vigour. Her Maje&s;ty, on her &s;ide, makes her utmo&s;t
efforts; &s;he takes 2000 more of Imperial cavalry into her pay, and fur|ni&s;hes
2500 recruits for the Imperial infantry, at the rate of 20 crowns
each; &s;he is at the expence of tran&s;porting them all to Catalonia, be&s;ides
an equal number of recruits for the Engli&s;h infantry, and five battalions
of an augmentation: it is expected that the&s;e have failed already. This
is intended as an example to excite the court of Vienna and the States-general
to exert them&s;elves likewi&s;e on their &s;ide. Prince Eugene, at parting,
gave rea&s;on to hope that the Emperor would &s;end four battalions to Spain,
if the States would do as much. The province of Holland has taken a
favourable re&s;olution in con&s;equence of this; and it is hoped, the other
provinces will &s;oon follow the example, e&s;pecially as count Zinzendorff
has &s;ince declared his Imperial Maje&s;ty's con&s;ent to this augmentation.
The&s;e troops will be a powerful &s;uccour, if they arrive in time, and the
greate&s;t care will be taken that they &s;hall; but the bad news we have
lately received from that country will oblige both the one and the other
to take &s;till more vigorous re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>I entreat your Electoral Highne&s;s to continue to honour me with your
kindne&s;s, and to be per&s;uaded of the inviolable and re&s;pectful attachment

<P>"AS it appears that the Kings of Denmark and of Poland cannot
po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of any place of &s;trength in Pomerania, the &s;ea&s;on
being too far advanced, it is to be pre&s;umed that the troops, after having
ravaged the enemy's country, will return to take up their winter-quarters
in Mecklenburg, and in other places in the circle of the Lower Saxony;
and that his Dani&s;h Maje&s;ty will choo&s;e to place troops in the country of
Bremen. It is ea&s;y to conceive, that, by that means, the &s;lames of war
may extend them&s;elves farther into the empire, to the great prejudice of
the allies; and you know, be&s;ides, Sir, that the &s;ituation of my domi|nions
is &s;uch, that they cannot be &s;afe, if the flames of war communi|cate
<PB N="248" REF="263">
them&s;elves to the country of Bremen.<MILESTONE N="September." UNIT="month"> It is, therefore, very ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
either for diverting the court of Denmark from &s;uch an in|tention,
or for giving weight to the negociations which I may &s;et on foot
with that court concerning this affair, that I &s;hould have &s;ome cavalry
and dragoons here next winter; it being impo&s;&s;ible to be able, with four
or five battalions, which are left with me, to provide with any efficacy
for the &s;afety of my dominions, and of all this neighbourhood. I will,
therefore, have a very particular obligation to you, if you employ your
influence to obtain permi&s;&s;ion from the Queen for &s;ome of the regiments
of cavalry and dragoons, which I have in her Maje&s;ty's pay, to come
back to my own dominions after the campaign, as the regiment of Haher
came back la&s;t winter, and upon the &s;ame footing. They may be ab|&s;ent
from the Low Countries, during the winter, without any prejudice to
the public; and it is preci&s;ely during that &s;ea&s;on that I &s;hall have need of
them here. I do not fore&s;ce that any thing can hinder me from &s;ending
them back to you at the opening of the next campaign: but by ne|glecting
this precaution, &s;ome events may happen, in my neighbourhood,
next winter, which will oblige me to recall all the troops I have in the
&s;ervice of the Queen and of the States. I hope you will be plea&s;ed to
exert your&s;elf to obtain this favour from the Queen. This new proof
of her kindne&s;s will attach me more and more to her intere&s;ts; and I
&s;hall retain the greate&s;t gratitude to you on account of it. I am, very

mini&s;ter who has both the cleare&s;t views and the be&s;t intentions, in
order to repre&s;ent to you, that the advanced &s;ea&s;on does not permit the
princes who are con&s;ederated again&s;t Sweden to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of any
place of &s;trength in Pomerania. It appears certain, that their troops, after
having committed &s;ome ravages, will return to take up their winter-quar|ters
in different places in the circle of the Lower Saxony, and particularly
in Mecklenburg; and that his Dani&s;h Maje&s;ty will choo&s;e to place &s;ome
troops in the country of Bremen. It is ea&s;y to conceive, that this may
<PB N="249" REF="264">
be the means of carrying the war to this &s;ide of the Elbe, from whence
it may extend it&s;elf farther into the empire, to the great prejudice of
the allies. Be&s;ides, the &s;ituation of my dominions is &s;uch, that they can|not
be in &s;afety if the war &s;hould communicate it&s;elf to the country of Bremen.</P>
<P>I &s;hall employ all my attentions to divert the court of Denmark from
forming this project. But, my lord, you are too penetrating not to &s;ee,
that having but very few infantry, without any cavalry, in my domi|nions,
I cannot exert my&s;elf with efficacy for the &s;ecurity of this neigh|bourhood
and of my own territories; and that it is very nece&s;&s;ary, in
order to give weight to the negociations which I de&s;ign to &s;et on foot
with the enemies of Sweden, and to the propo&s;als which I may make to
them, that I &s;hould have &s;ome cavalry and dragoons here next winter.
As the de&s;ign I have in view is the common intere&s;t of all the allies, and
as I &s;hall act in perfect concert with the Queen, I hope her Maje&s;ty will
permit &s;ome of the regiments of cavalry and dragoons, which I have in
her pay, to return to my dominions, as the regiment of Hahn returned
la&s;t winter, and upon the &s;ame footing. I will owe you, my lord, a
very particular obligation, if you will be plea&s;ed to employ your influ|ence
with the Queen, in obtaining this favour from her, by repre&s;enting
to her, that the&s;e regiments may be ab&s;ent from the Low Countries dur|ing
the winter, without any prejudice to the public, and that I can &s;end
them back at the opening of the next campaign; whereas, by neglecting
this precaution, &s;ome events may happen next winter in my neighbour|hood,
which will oblige me to recall all the troops which I have in the
&s;ervice of the Queen and of the States. I wrote on this very &s;ubject to
the duke of Marlborough. It is of &s;uch importance, that I cannot doubt
but you will intere&s;t your&s;elf in its &s;ucce&s;s. I entreat you, my lord, to be
per&s;uaded that I &s;hall retain a grateful &s;en&s;e of this, and to allow me,
for the future, to te&s;tify, on all occa&s;ions which may offer, the perfect

<P>"I AM much obliged to you for your letter of the 31&s;t of Augu&s;t,
and for your having been plea&s;ed to communicate to me your plan
of operations for the en&s;uing campaign. I cannot but approve of it, in
all re&s;pects, and I con&s;ider it with you, as the &s;ure&s;t means of reducing
France to the nece&s;&s;ity of concurring in a rea&s;onable peace. But I ima|gine
you will allow that &s;ecrecy is the life of this project, and that it is
nece&s;&s;ary to avoid, with all po&s;&s;ible attention, to give the enemy any
room to perceive it; &s;ince, in that ca&s;e, they will not fail to take the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
mea&s;ures for preventing a blow which may be &s;o fatal to them,
and for forming magazines on their &s;ide, whatever expence they may co&s;t
them. I leave you, then, Sir, to reflect, if by &s;tationing the cavalry on
the frontiers, you will not di&s;cover too clearly to the French, what is &s;o
<PB N="252" REF="267">
nece&s;&s;ary to conceal from them. It appears to me likewi&s;e, that my
troops, though &s;ent to more di&s;tant places, may, by &s;peedy marches,
arrive time enough at the place where you will judge proper to a&s;&s;emble
the army. As to the re&s;t, I hope that the mea&s;ures which you will take
for the execution of your project, will be no ob&s;tacle to the return of
the few regiments of cavalry and dragoons which the nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;ing
from the &s;tate of affairs obliges me to demand of the Queen for &s;ome
months. It is about the end of autumn or beginning of winter that I
&s;hall have principally occa&s;ion for them; and I reckon that I &s;hall &s;end
them back to you in time. I refer my&s;elf to my preceding letter con|cerning
the rea&s;ons which make me de&s;irous of having them &s;oon in
my dominions. They are of &s;uch importance for the &s;ecurity of this
neighbourhood, and for the common intere&s;t of the allies, that I cannot
doubt but they will have your approbation, and that you will employ your
influence to obtain from the Queen the favour which I demand. I am

&s;tation the Engli&s;h and Dutch cavalry in the places on the frontiers;
where, being under the direction of their own generals, they may be

Engli&s;h cavalry, that they have always had their winter-quarters in places
in Flanders which are not far from tho&s;e now in que&s;tion. It will be
otherwi&s;e with my troops, which, in &s;uch quarters, will be no longer
under the in&s;pection of my generals, and will be too di&s;tant to receive
their recruits with facility; whereas, when my troops are placed in their

&s;ent to them early, and that the whole corps &s;hall be in condition to march

I hope likewi&s;e I &s;hall &s;end back time enough the regiments of cavalry

in all re&s;pects, to be paid this debt in ca&s;h. Our intention, there|fore

obtain this payment, a&s;&s;uring him, that we &s;hall be very particularly
obliged to the Queen, if her Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to take, upon her

for me, that you have been plea&s;ed to communicate to me the
commi&s;&s;ion which the Queen gave you, to treat of a peace, in concur|rence
with the States-general. It is true, that the Earl of Rivers likewi&s;e
has had orders, to communicate to the Elector, my &s;on, and to me, her
Maje&s;ty's laudable intentions; but he did not enlarge upon the &s;ubject,
as you have been at the trouble to do. He has al&s;o brought a pre&s;ent to
the Queen's god-daughter, as an honourable mark of her favours, which
are infinitely e&s;teemed. I would not, however, give my parchment
for it: &s;ince it will be an everla&s;ting monument in the archives of Han|nover;
and the pre&s;ent of the little prince&s;s will go, when &s;he is grown
up, into another family. As for the re&s;t, I will not combat all the rea|&s;ons
which you produce, to make me acquainted with tho&s;e which the
Queen has to be di&s;&s;atisfied with her allies; but as her Maje&s;ty entered
into this war, for the good of her crown, and to hinder France from be|coming
too powerful; and as her Maje&s;ty's arms have been always vic|torious;
as my lord Rivers, la&s;t year, &s;poke of nothing but war, which the
Queen was determined to continue with the utmo&s;t vigour; and as all

tho&s;e things of which you &s;peak, were then already pa&s;t; you mu&s;t not

peace is to be concluded upon &s;uch terms as are printed in the Engli&s;h
Gazettes. If you had been willing to accept peace on tho&s;e terms, a
great deal of blood, and a great deal of the money of England and Hol|land
might have been &s;aved, and no one is ignorant of the &s;tate of
the Emperor's finances, which indeed England has generou&s;ly and
bountifully &s;upplied. As her Maje&s;ty finds now, the burden of this too
heavy for her people, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;he looks out for a remedy,
which I heartily wi&s;h may contibute to her glory, and to the good of her
kingdoms, and of her allies. But hitherto, it was always believed, that
the too great power of France would be prejudicial to them all, and
e&s;pecially to England. But you know this, undoubtedly, better than
I, who do not pretend to under&s;tand affairs of &s;tate. With regard to
tho&s;e which are private, they will always incline me to be, with great

of the Tories, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of power, he was unwilling
to throw him&s;elf entirely into the hands of that party, by di&s;placing all
the real and &s;uppo&s;ed Whigs. In the inferior departments, the retainers
of the former mini&s;try &s;till remained; and the duke of Marlborough was
continued at the head of the army The mini&s;ter would have been ex|tremely

the duke's de&s;igns, induced them to di&s;mi&s;s him abruptly from all
his offices, on the thirtieth of December, 1711. They knew that, in
conjunction with prince Eugene, who was daily expected in England, he
was forming plans dangerous to their own power, if not to the repo&s;e of
the kingdom. The intrigues between the&s;e two great generals and the
baron de Bothmar are minutely &s;et forth by the marquis de Torcy, in his

certainly make him his heir, if he will yet abandon that ill-family that he
is &s;o linked to at pre&s;ent; and, in order to prove his zeal, as &s;oon as the
quarrel is made up with Mr. Jacob Smith [the King of France] and Mi&s;s
Dibby Jons [the prince&s;s Anne] he will &s;end his relation to your cou&s;in
Sandy [Hannover], to demon&s;trate to him that he is &s;incere; and, in the

arts that he is capable of. Tho&s;e, he knows, look another way. He finds
ways to le&s;&s;en and di&s;courage, and whatever they have is what he cannot
avoid. He would not have a clamorous complaint; &s;o manages it with
dexterity. Your relations [the church party] &s;ee it, but cannot help
them&s;elves; for, on the other &s;ide, Mr. Willie [the Whigs] would ruin
them wor&s;e; &s;o that, to u&s;e a modi&s;h expre&s;&s;ion, they are forced to hold
the candle to the devil, at pre&s;ent, and after a little time he will defy
them to hurt him, when the great deci&s;ion is over.</P>
<P>Now to public news; I mu&s;t inform you that the parliament, by the
votes which you &s;ee, have &s;o expo&s;ed the allies, that it is plain they do
not intend to have any more of the &s;ame dealings with them, and that a
peace is certain. The Portugal mini&s;ter &s;aid, at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, in
<PB N="270" REF="285">
public, that the parliament had called his ma&s;ter rogue and ra&s;cal; but
that he was abu&s;ed in good company, meaning the Emperor and the
Dutch. The Whigs croud after prince Eugene, and cabal with him
hourly; but it can come to nothing. The parliament is to go on the bar|rier
treaty: that will lay a great &s;cene open. The duke of Marlborough
did not &s;ign it; but there is a letter of his, that proves that he ordered
my lord Town&s;end to &s;ign it. They &s;ay the two &s;cored articles are,
that the Dutch &s;hould have all the conquered towns from Cambray to
the other &s;ide for them&s;elves, and that they are to furni&s;h England with
30,000 men and 40 &s;hips, for the loyali&s;ts of England to &s;ecure them.
The parliament will be judges of that de&s;ign. The Queen declares they
did not let her read it, but &s;aid it was approved of by the council, &s;o
&s;he &s;igned it. The article relating to Portugal is very di&s;honourable for
England; they agreeing to have our fleet to attend them, on all occa|&s;ions
they thought proper for them. This makes a great noi&s;e, has ex|po&s;ed
the Whigs more than all their other management, and left them
without excu&s;e. The birth-day of the Queen, the duke of Marlborough
was in a chair in St. James's Park, with the curtains drawn; the mob,
that believed it to be the prince Eugene, huzza'd the chair; but the
duke mode&s;tly drew back the curtains and put him&s;elf out, and with a
&s;ign &s;hewed his di&s;like to the &s;alutation. The mob, finding their mi&s;|take,
and that it was he, cried out, "Stop thief," which was a thorough
mortification to him. His daughters, that day, to &s;hew their contempt
of the court, were in wrapping-gowns at a window in St. James's, to &s;ee
the company pa&s;s, two of them, and the other two drove through the
Pall-mall four times, in the wor&s;t mob-dre&s;s they could put them&s;elves.
The duke was in a black &s;uit, that day, and his &s;on-in-law, the duke of
Montague, was at court in a plain, coar&s;e, red coat, with a long &s;houlder-knot,
in ridicule of the day; but the Queen had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee
the mo&s;t &s;plendid court that ever was, and crowded more than ever, by
all the church, nobility and gentry. There was a &s;hort uproar. My lord
Marlborough finds his levees much thinner than they were, and daily
le&s;s and le&s;s. The people are di&s;gu&s;ted at him. In a little time he will
be odious to them. How they huzza the duke of Ormond, who loves
popularity too well. Prince Eugene wears the &s;word the Queen gave
him, ever &s;ince the birth-day; it is worth 6000 <HI>l.</HI> He has had his an|&s;wer
<PB N="271" REF="286">
from the third day he was here. The court wi&s;h him gone; but
my lord Oxford does not apprehend any thing from him. The Whigs,
&s;ince they mi&s;&s;ed &s;ending him to the Tower by their impeachment, can|not
reach him &s;ince the additional lords. They &s;ay there will be fix more
made. The Whigs cry out at the number that was made to &s;erve a turn,
and &s;ay it de&s;troys one of the three parts of our con&s;titution; and made
the Queen and lords one, which ought to be two parts, and the commons
the third. Though it is in the power of the crown, the tru&s;t is betrayed,
when u&s;ed to de&s;troy the power of parliaments. It cannot be imagined
how the votes that reflected on the allies have di&s;couraged the Whigs; for
it has ended all their hopes of having the war continued. This news of
Bra&s;ette has been an unlucky &s;troke for the allies. The Scotti&s;h peers
will &s;it no more; they have ab&s;ented them&s;elves the&s;e five days; declare
the union broke; and this of liberty for the church-clergy is directly
again&s;t the agreement. The Scots will prove them&s;elves the bribery,
and to whom the money was given to get it &s;igned. There is nobody
made ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; it is in commi&s;&s;ion, they &s;ay, till my lord
Strafford's return. The duke of Somer&s;et is not yet out of the bed-cham|ber.
The lady Catharine Hyde is bed-chamber lady. My lord Not|tingham
continues to work to draw &s;ome over to the flying party, which
he de&s;igned to ruin the lord trea&s;urer with; but it will not do. The
Di&s;&s;enters are highly di&s;&s;atisfied with the State-whigs, for betraying them,
as they call it. My lord trea&s;urer declares to them he would have pre|vented
it, if he could; for certainly he is a friend to them, though an
enemy to the State-whigs, who would have ruined him and his country."</P>

<P>"THE whigi&s;h faction, being di&s;appointed in the execution of all their
black de&s;igns &s;ince their being turned out, indu&s;triou&s;ly made u&s;e
of the Emperor's and Hannoverian mini&s;ters (who were well prepared to
break off the treaty) to procure the aver&s;ion of the vulgar again&s;t a
peace.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep made towards it was, that the Emperor's mini&s;ters hav|ing
acquainted baron Bothmar and the whigi&s;h faction, that he was well
<PB N="272" REF="287">
a&s;&s;ured the Tory mini&s;try intended to procure a match to be made, and
a marriage &s;olemnized between the Pretender's &s;i&s;ter and the King of
Sweden; and that re&s;toring the Pretender would be the con&s;equence of
&s;uch a match; and that he is in the bottom of the pre&s;ent negociation for
a peace.</P>
<P>This was calculated for a bait to bring over the ignorant part of the
commonalty on their &s;ide, as Doctor Sacheverel's &s;ermon was &s;erviceable
for the Tories, upon which en&s;ued the late change of the mini&s;try; and
accordingly Bothmar was prevailed upon to pre&s;ent the late memorial
to the Queen, who &s;urreptitiou&s;ly got it printed and publi&s;hed again&s;t the
&s;itting of the parliament.</P>
<P>But finding it had not the de&s;ired effect, they were re&s;olved to leave no
&s;tone unturned, and accordingly pre&s;&s;ed prince Eugene's coming for
England, to lay before the Queen and parliament his ma&s;ter's mighty
propo&s;als, viz. that England &s;hould have all the We&s;t Indies, and a free
trade throughout all Spain, and that 90,000 men, at his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty's
proper charges, &s;hould be employed wherever the Queen &s;hould
appoint.</P>
<P>The&s;e high propo&s;als put them in mighty hopes of prevailing with the
Queen, having the hou&s;e of lords already prepared, the majority being
Whigs: but, on the contrary, the Queen and mini&s;try were &s;o aver&s;e to
it, that, to balance the lords, &s;he made twelve new peers all of a &s;tart,
whereby &s;he has e&s;tabli&s;hed a majority of the lords, as well as of the
commons, of her &s;ide for the peace.</P>
<P>But her Maje&s;ty, finding the faction &s;o earne&s;t for the prince's com|ing,
upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to Holland, to pre|vent
his coming over, who mi&s;&s;ing him, by rea&s;on of his having em|barked
before the me&s;&s;enger's arrival, and his being detained by contrary
winds for &s;everal days, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary (in order to weaken his
preten&s;ions and di&s;countenance the faction) to remove the duke of Marl|borough
from all places of tru&s;t, which &s;udden and unexpected change
quite broke all their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The prince at his landing, finding things in this di&s;mal po&s;ture, and
fore&s;eeing his fruitle&s;s errand, would expo&s;e him to a public ridicule, con|certed
with his party to form another plau&s;ible &s;cheme of laying before
the Queen and both hou&s;es, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="288">
That his ma&s;ter had formed a new alliance with Holland, Pru&s;&s;ia,
Denmark, Poland, the Czar of Mu&s;covy, Hannover, and the other princes
of the Empire, and all the Hans Towns, for &s;ecuring the prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
and if po&s;&s;ible to bring his Swedi&s;h Maje&s;ty into the alliance.
But the mini&s;try look upon all this to be only a de&s;ign to get the ma|nagement
again into their own hands, rather than a &s;incere intention of
performing any better, than the la&s;t treaty has been executed on the late
Emperor's part; and accordingly rejected it.</P>
<P>Then little Eugene thought of another project, viz. To have the duke
of Hannover's &s;on brought into England, wherein he is like to fail, as
well as in all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not omit, how the party have premeditated and concerted
the manner of the reception of this little emi&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to render him the more popular, and his errand the more plau|&s;ible,
he was to be met by &s;everal thou&s;ands on hor&s;eback at his landing,
and conducted with great acclamations and huzzas through the city,
where great illuminations and ringing of bells was to be made, and the
mob to cry out, No peace, No peace; and then great and &s;plendid en|tertainments
were to be made by &s;ub&s;cription for him. All which fine
doings were timely prevented, by the vigilance of the mini&s;try, who were

the magi&s;tracy, was, that in the year 1708, they contrived and accom|pli&s;hed
the betraying the towns of Ghent and Bruges; the army of the
High Allies being thereby brought in the greate&s;t danger of peri&s;hing all
at once. My lord duke and Cadogan, whether they had a hand in it or
not, agreed anew with the &s;aid per&s;ons in offices to procure for them a
general pardon, which my lord duke promi&s;ed to obtain by your Ma|je&s;ty,
as it al&s;o happened, notwith&s;tanding that the &s;aid lord duke and
<PB N="275" REF="290">
Cadogan were fully informed and knew them&s;elves the &s;ecret corre&s;pond|ence
of our governors with the generals and mini&s;ters of the enemy, as
al&s;o the per&s;ons who contributed thereto; and for the &s;aid general par|don,
the fir&s;t got two hundred thou&s;and gilders, and the latter ten thou|&s;and
pi&s;toles, all out of the remainder of the revenues of the &s;aid ruined
province of Flanders.</P>
<P>The afore&s;aid members or governors of the &s;aid province have, not
long &s;ince, given to the &s;aid Cadogan, the &s;um of five thou&s;and pi&s;toles,
upon his promi&s;e that they &s;hould be continued in their employments;
which &s;um he has received at Bru&s;&s;els, in the hou&s;e of the Sieur Vander|gote,
one of the council of &s;tate, his great friend; be&s;ides other gentle|men
of the &s;aid council, who are enemies of the High Allies and protectors
of their enemies; and that was done at the time that our convoy was
beaten between Ghent and Courtray, in the pari&s;h of St. Eloyvive, when
in&s;tead of furthering the &s;ervice of the war, he preferred his own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Over and above the &s;everal &s;ums, which he and my lord duke have
otherwi&s;e exacted from our poor province, we &s;hall allege no other for
&s;hortne&s;s &s;ake, this &s;erving only to ob&s;erve that they have continued &s;uch
members in the magi&s;tracy of Ghent and Bruges, notwith&s;tanding they
had &s;erved the French before, and had contrived and accompli&s;hed the
betraying of the &s;aid towns, only thereby to continue to feed their ava|rice
by extortions from the poor province, that tho&s;e per&s;ons might not
di&s;cover to your Maje&s;ty and parliament their thieveries.</P>
<P>The matter is come to that pitch, that her Maje&s;ty having no opinion
of the conduct of tho&s;e two money-thir&s;ty per&s;ons, the duke and Cado|gan,
they are capable to induce the afore&s;aid members to give atte&s;ta|tions
of their good behaviour in having reaped no profits from this pro|vince;
but, it is hoped, that your Maje&s;ty and the parliament will have
no regard to them, it being certain, that one thief will not willingly di&s;|cover
another; that is to &s;ay, that the &s;aid lord duke and Cadogan, who
have procured to the &s;aid directors of our province the amne&s;ty concern|ing
the &s;aid treachery, will ea&s;ily be induced to excu&s;e tho&s;e that pro|tected
them: and to di&s;cover the truth of what is above mentioned, that
her Maje&s;ty will plea&s;e to cau&s;e an inquiry to be made into the conduct
and roguery of tho&s;e two per&s;ons during the war in the Netherlands, by
<PB N="276" REF="291">
&s;uch members of the new parliament as have been employed under
them as officers in her Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>We pro&s;trate our&s;elves at your Maje&s;ty's feet with all humility, that
your Maje&s;ty will be plea&s;ed to reflect on the premi&s;es, and con&s;ider the
mi&s;erable condition, in which our afore&s;aid province is involved by this
long war, and to deliver and free us of the &s;aid lord duke and Cadogan,
two profe&s;&s;ed thieves to our province and the reputation of your Maje&s;ty
and the whole Engli&s;h nation, who are plea&s;ed to pay their troops and
officers &s;o largely with their own money and never permitted that any of
their chief officers, as the&s;e two, &s;hould enrich them&s;elves &s;o unrea&s;on|ably
with the money of our poor country, much le&s;s to protect &s;uch per|&s;ons,
as &s;hewed their affection entirely for the French, and &s;till corre&s;pond
with them. There is &s;o much of this, that all the favours they have
&s;hewed to the enemy would be &s;ufficient to fill a book, the &s;ending of
money to &s;u&s;tain the war again&s;t us being one of their lea&s;t favours.</P>
<P>We further pray your Maje&s;ty to &s;end another plenipotentiary to our
government, with expre&s;s orders, to turn out all &s;uch per&s;ons in the ma|gi&s;tracy,
who have &s;erved the enemy, and to put in their room &s;uch per|&s;ons,
who are fit to &s;erve your Maje&s;ty and to ea&s;e our poor province.
As for &s;ecretary Laws, like ma&s;ters like men, of whom no good te&s;ti|mony
can likewi&s;e be given. Wherefore, we pray, likewi&s;e, your Maje&s;ty
to appoint another in his room; and, in &s;o doing your Maje&s;ty will find
plainly more pro&s;perity in your arms, re&s;tore the reputation of the nation,
and further have the ble&s;&s;ing of God Almighty, for having puni&s;hed the
bad, for which all &s;uperiors are ordained. And in ca&s;e your Maje&s;ty is
not plea&s;ed to appoint other mini&s;ters, in the room of Cadogan and Laws
as al&s;o my lord duke, who will better promote the glory of your Maje&s;ty
and the reputation of the parliament and Engli&s;h nations, who mu&s;t im|mediately
change the re&s;pective magi&s;trates, as is u&s;ual every year, ac|cording
to the cu&s;toms and privileges of the country, we &s;hall &s;till be
governed by, and remain under, traitors to your Maje&s;ty and the High
Allies, who were &s;erviceable to the enemy, and were put into tho&s;e em|ployments
and have now continued in them for four years together, which
if not remedied, we &s;hould be happier to be governed by Turks than by
that Briti&s;h thief Cadogan. Relying on the protection of your Ma|je&s;ty,
<PB N="277" REF="292">

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I Have received yours of the 1&s;t. I &s;hall, &s;ince it is a &s;atisfaction to
you, give you an account of all the public news that I hear. The
vote of the hou&s;e of commons again&s;t my lord Town&s;end, for &s;igning the
Barrier treaty, which declares him an enemy to the Queen and coun|try,
it is believed, will have no other con&s;equence, 'till after the peace,
but to give a latitude to our plenipotentiaries, to act on the mo&s;t advan|tageous
terms they can, notwith&s;tanding that treaty. The death of the
Dauphin has put the Whigs in fre&s;h hopes, that prince Eugene has pre|vailed
to get it in&s;i&s;ted on, that Spain and the Indies &s;hall be the Em|peror's.
He cabals daily with the Whigs, in a very indecent manner; the
great project is, to have the prince of Hannover here, to no&s;e the Queen,
at lea&s;t; but their aims are further. The Dutch, Hannover, and Em|peror's
mini&s;ters here, are laying a &s;cheme for it, and have carried it &s;o
far, that the command of the army, this Summer, is not offered to the
prince of Hannover, as was intended. The duke of Ormond com|mands
<PB N="280" REF="295">
in Flanders, and is fitting up his equipage. The vote of the
Lords, which they got by &s;urpri&s;e, the hou&s;e being thin, and the Scotch
lords retiring, to make them&s;elves con&s;iderable, the Whigs carried it, and
addre&s;&s;ed, with a dete&s;tation to the articles from France, though they did
not come judiciou&s;ly before them; it was only to encourage the Dutch,
and Emperor, and Portugal, to in&s;i&s;t on great demands; but had no
weight here. The hou&s;e of commons being zealous for the good of the
kingdom, out-balances all their tricks, and the mini&s;try treat &s;ure and
gain ground daily. The &s;cheme is only to expo&s;e and di&s;courage, and
undeceive the kingdom; their puni&s;hment will be left 'till the peace is
fini&s;hed. It is my lord of Oxford's politics to &s;mooth and check, and
would not have removed the duke of Marlborough, if it had not been
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The Hannover mini&s;ter is highly di&s;plea&s;ed at an
accident that has happened; his letters he &s;ent by a &s;ervant, betwixt 11
and 12 to the general po&s;t hou&s;e: at&mdash;, he was robbed of his let|ters
and what little he had about him. The&mdash;will have it, our mi|ni&s;ter
laid the de&s;ign to come by his letters. It was not ami&s;s to find
what he and prince Eugene have been contriving with the Whigs. He
has had his an&s;wer, from the fir&s;t of his coming, and has been told, by a
&s;ide wind, that the court is not &s;atisfied with his &s;tay, &s;ince he is &s;o clo&s;e
in cabals with the di&s;&s;atisfied lords. He told him, that &s;aid this to
him, that he knew that; but he &s;hould do what was convenient to his in|tere&s;t.
If he &s;tays much longer, he will be &s;ent away, contrary to the
Queen's fir&s;t re&s;olution. His nephew is taken ill of the &s;mall pox; &s;o
that gives a fre&s;h pretence. The Whigs have &s;o contrived it, that it
will be moved, at the congre&s;s, to remove the prince that is in France.
By the in&s;tigation of the Whigs, this is moved here, by prince Eugene,
in the Emperor's name, and that all the allies &s;hall be guarantees for the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Hannover; but it is believed our plenipotentiaries have
in&s;tructions not to have any &s;uch guarantees, which would limit the
people of England; for hereafter, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, they mu&s;t a&s;k all
the allies leave to choo&s;e a King, and my lord chief ju&s;tice has declared
it trea&s;on in tho&s;e that &s;igned the Barrier treaty. On that account, all
the people in the country have got the book which I hope you have,
called "The conduct of the late mini&s;try and the allies;" and another,
"The obligations that the Dutch have to us." They are two books worth
<PB N="281" REF="296">
reading. They have &s;et us in a right light, and have &s;o exa&s;perated all
the counties of England again&s;t the late mini&s;try and our allies, that
they are in &s;ome counties ready to addre&s;s the Queen, to puni&s;h tho&s;e
that acted in all their vile practices; and now the barrier treaty it&s;elf,
with remarks on it, is publi&s;hed, written by the &s;ame hand, which is a
very good one. They are approved and directed by my lord Oxford;
the Whigs an&s;wer them, but in that railing evading manner that has no
force.</P>
<P>My lord Marlborough is very humble, vi&s;its every creature that has
any credit. To general Webb, he &s;ent to know, when he would be at
home, he would vi&s;it him. He &s;ent him word, he never would be at
home to him; that he had done him all the inju&s;tice he could, when he was
in power, and that now he would do him all the ju&s;tice he could, which
he thought he de&s;erved; and my lord Wharton told my lord trea&s;urer,
that he played well at whi&s;t. What he could not make by tricks, he
made up by knaves. The trea&s;urer an&s;wered him, that they believed
the game up before he took the cards, and had made tricks out of all the
knaves, let who would hold them; but he ob&s;erved their game, and
&s;hould be &s;orry to be thought a bungler. The hou&s;e of commons are
re&s;olved to throw Walpole out of the hou&s;e again. He was cho&s;en a|gain;
but now they have lodged a petition again&s;t him. The Hannover
re&s;ident took the liberty to threaten &s;ome of the leading members, with
his ma&s;ter's re&s;entment, if they pretended to meddle with the barrier
treaty, but did not deter them; but, as a je&s;t, it is &s;aid, the &s;ame mem|bers
cau&s;ed his &s;ervant to be robbed of his letters, to &s;ee what he had
writ of them. All here believe the peace certain. We have &s;trange
&s;tories &s;ent from France, of the duke of Orleans being taken in the very
act of ince&s;t with his daughter, the dutche&s;s of Berry, when he had
made her, and the lady the duke de Berry had a de&s;ign of, drunk; whil&s;t
one debauched her, the other abu&s;ed his own daughter; and that the
Dauphin was poi&s;oned; the&s;e &s;tories are common; they were fir&s;t told
by Madam Malous, the niece of the late lord Fever&s;ham, who lives at
Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, where prince Eugene is every night, at lea&s;t, three times
a week. She pretends to have letters of it from France. There all the
foreign mini&s;ters are two or three times a week. Baron Bothmar, the
Hannover Envoy, daily &s;hews his di&s;like to my lord of Oxford, and
<PB N="282" REF="297">
does his ma&s;ter great prejudice by it, and has turned the court again&s;t
his proceedings. Prince Eugene is angry, that&mdash;&mdash;put
in his adverti&s;ement by way of je&s;t: a reward for any that could bring
the names of the&s;e fifty per&s;ons, his mother the dutche&s;s of Bollin poi|&s;oned.

<P>The truth of the following anecdotes is, in &s;ome degree, a&s;certained by
collateral proofs. The marquis de Torcy, in his memoirs, mentions
them, with corroborating circum&s;tances; and he was not a writer, that
advanced facts upon mere &s;urmi&s;es, being a man of integrity, intelligence,
and abilities. The Stuart Papers of the pre&s;ent year are full of anec|dotes
of the &s;ame kind; and the mini&s;try, by the precautions they took,
&s;eemed to have been convinced, that dangerous con&s;piracies were formed.
There can &s;carce a doubt be entertained, that Marlborough, prince Eu|gene

though perhaps, the circum&s;tances are exaggerated. The ruffians called

<P><DATE>April 10, 1749.</DATE>&mdash;"MR. Era&s;mus Lewis told me, that at the latter

Anne &s;ent for lord Somers, and told him, as they were alone, &s;he having
an opinion of his judgment and impartiality, de&s;ired him to tell her his

that he was the wor&s;t man that God Almighty ever made; that his am|bition
was boundle&s;s and his avarice in&s;atiable; and that he had neither
honour nor con&s;cience to re&s;train him from any wicked attempt, even

Queen was weary of the d&mdash;&s;s) expected to be made fir&s;t mini&s;ter, but
was baulked. The Queen had expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf advantageou&s;ly of his
honour, integrity, and capacity. During the debates about the peace, in
oppo&s;ition to it, M. de Torcy acquainted lord Oxford, that after the
Duke of Marlborough had hindered the peace of 1706, when it &s;hould
have been made, he had treated with the French court to make them one,
and was to have two millions of crowns for it. This would have been
done, but for M. Chamillard, a weak mini&s;ter, who during the &s;iege of
Li&s;le, came to Valenciennes, &s;ent the duke of Marlborough word, that
he expected he would rai&s;e the &s;iege of Li&s;le, as a proof of his &s;incerity in
the peace they had treated and &s;ettled. The duke of Marlborough was
angry, and wrote to the duke of Berwick, that there was an end of the
affair, and he would have nothing more to do with the treaty.</P>
<P>When M. de Torcy di&s;covered this, the King of France allowed lord
Oxford to make u&s;e of it, to &s;end the duke of Marlborough abroad; but
in&s;i&s;ted that his life &s;hould not be touched; and &s;o it was. They had a
meeting at Thomas Harley's hou&s;e, in James &s;treet, We&s;tmin&s;ter. Ox|ford
coming to the &s;treet door, in his coach, the duke of Marlborough in
a chair to the garden door opening into the park; it was then re&s;olved,
<PB N="284" REF="299">
that the duke of Marlborough &s;hould go abroad. Prince Eugene and
lord Wharton both &s;aid, on the occa&s;ion, that the duke of Marlborough
had not a clear con&s;cience, or he would not have &s;ubmitted to that
&s;tep.</P>
<P>Several mea&s;ures were propo&s;ed to oppo&s;e the peace, and &s;everal
&s;chemes &s;ent to Vienna; &s;ome for &s;eizing the Queen, others for &s;eizing
the mini&s;try, and one for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Oxford and Bolingbroke in their
chairs. Prince Eugene wrote about this la&s;t, to count Zinzendorff, then
at the Hague; who wrote, in an&s;wer, that &s;uch mea&s;ures were extremely
hazardous, and &s;carce to be undertaken; but if this was re&s;olved on, he
advi&s;ed prince Eugene to come over to Holland, before it was executed.</P>
<P>Among other &s;chemes, one was for the duke of Marlborough, by his
power, as general, to a&s;&s;emble 2 or 3000 men, at an hour, in different
&s;quares of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and to &s;eize St. James's. This was di&s;covered,
and lord Oxford &s;ent to Mr. Lewis to come immediately to the office,
that morning, his pre&s;ence being nece&s;&s;ary by ten o'clock. When he
came, he found the lord chancellor and all the lords of council there.
The bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;uper&s;ede the duke of Marlborough's commi&s;&s;ion, as
general, under the broad &s;eal. There had been before an order under
the privy &s;eal &s;ent him not to act more as general; but his commi&s;&s;ion
being under the great &s;eal, could not be &s;uper&s;eded, but by a revo|cation
under the great &s;eal. When this was done, the duke of Marlbo|rough
would not act &s;o again&s;t law, as to rendezvous the men: he was
not made for hazards.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, the duke of Marlborough's quitting the oppo&s;ition to the
peace, had ruined his credit at Hannover and at the Hague. King
George was re&s;olved to make no alteration in mini&s;try, but 40000 <HI>l.</HI> given
to Bothmar, at the Hope, cau&s;ed the duke of Marlborough's apology to
to be accepted, and all Queen Anne's mini&s;ters to be turned out<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Era&s;inus Lewis, was under &s;ecretary to the Earl of Oxford.

<P>The Marquis de Torcy relates, in his Memoirs, that he had his ma&s;ter's orders, to offer four millions of livres to the duke of Marlborough, at the Hague, in 1709, if he employed his intere&s;t in contributing to a peace<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">vol. i. p. 299.</NOTE>.

Be it by this, or what other means &s;oever, Mr. Matthew Judd

the Tory majority in the lord's hou&s;e is but &s;mall, and by the ab&s;ence of

<DIV3 TYPE="editor's note">
<P>Mr. Menzies, &s;o often exhibited under the feigned name of Abram
is the Scotch gentleman mentioned by Mon&s;ieur Menager, in the account
of his &s;ecret negociations in England.</P>
<P>Menager having &s;igned the preliminary articles of a &s;eparate treaty be|tween
France and Britain, employed the time he &s;taid afterwards in
London, in attempting, according to his in&s;tructions, to render &s;ome
&s;ervice to the court of St. Germains, and introduced the &s;ubject in a
conver&s;ation with Mr. St. John. They fore&s;aw, that the King of
France would be obliged, in the en&s;uing treaty, <Q REND="inline">"not &s;o much to aban|don
the chevalier, as to acknowledge the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the
hou&s;e of Hannover, as it was mentioned in the &s;econd preliminary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minute of Mon&s;icur Menager's negociation.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Menager propo&s;ed that a &s;ecret article &s;hould be made by the Queen,
to di&s;engage the King from all the obligations of &s;uch agreements upon
&s;uch &s;ub&s;equent occa&s;ions as might happen; and a declaration from her
Maje&s;ty, that all the engagements the King &s;hould enter into in the
treaty of peace, &s;hould be &s;o under&s;tood by the Queen. St. John was
afraid the Queen would not &s;ign &s;uch a declaration; but he thought &s;he
would declare, by word of mouth, that &s;he would be &s;atisfied to under|&s;tand
the treaty in &s;uch a manner; and that whenever &s;he di&s;engaged the
King from it, the obligation on him, as to the recognition of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
&s;hould cea&s;e. Bolingbroke mentioned this propo&s;al to the
Queen; and, with her con&s;ent, introduced Menager to Mrs. Ma&s;ham,
that he might learn her Maje&s;ty's intentions from that lady, as he him|&s;elf
did not choo&s;e to meddle further in the affair.</P>
<P>Two points were agreed upon between Menager and Mrs. Ma&s;ham:
Fir&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"that, for the &s;atisfaction of the people at home, and the allies
abroad, the King &s;hould be required, in the Queen's name, to abandon
her brother and his intere&s;t, on pretence of adhering to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as
it was now e&s;tabli&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P>2d. <Q REND="inline">"That neverthele&s;s, this &s;eeming to abandon the &s;aid intere&s;t,
was to be &s;o under&s;tood, that the King &s;hould not be obliged, in ca&s;e of
her Maje&s;ty's decea&s;e, not to u&s;e his endeavours for the placing the &s;aid
prince on his father's throne, to which he had an undoubted right<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 276.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="304">
Mrs. Ma&s;ham told him, <Q REND="inline">"that it was the pre&s;ent unhappine&s;s of the
Queen to po&s;&s;e&s;s the throne of her brother, which &s;he had no other claim
to than what the political mea&s;ures of the &s;tate had made legal, and in a
&s;ort nece&s;&s;ary; which, however, &s;he believed, gave her Maje&s;ty often|times
&s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s: that this was not all the misfortune, but that,
by the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tate, &s;he was obliged, not only again&s;t her di&s;|po&s;ition,
but even again&s;t her principles, to further and promote the
continuance of the u&s;urpation, not only beyond her own life, but for
ever. That I might be &s;ure, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, it would be an
inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction to her Maje&s;ty, to &s;ee her&s;elf delivered from the
fatal nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;o much wrong; and if it could be po&s;&s;ible, with
&s;afety to the religion and liberties of her &s;ubjects, to have her brother re|&s;tored
to his right, at lea&s;t, after her decea&s;e, if it could not be done
before."</Q></P>
<P>"That it was true the Queen did not &s;ee through this; and it &s;eemed
next to impo&s;&s;ible, <Q REND="inline">"the rage and irreconcilable aver&s;ion of the greate&s;t
part of the common people to her brother being grown to &s;uch a
height:"</Q> nay, &s;he &s;aid, the Queen found it would be impo&s;&s;ible to
enter upon any treaty of peace, or &s;o much as to let the people hear of
putting an end to the war, without entering into the &s;tronge&s;t engage|ments
po&s;&s;ible for the confirming the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hannover;
<Q REND="inline">"a thing that I am &s;ure, &s;ays &s;he, is all our aver&s;ions;"</Q> and we have
no retreat but to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, in hopes of his ordering
things &s;o at this treaty, that he may be at liberty to &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t in
the work, whenever an opportunity &s;hould pre&s;ent it&s;elf: that, to this
end, the plenipotentiaries from hence, <Q REND="inline">"though there was no commu|nicating
any thing to them by way of confidence,"</Q> &s;hould be in&s;tructed

<P>Menager, upon his arrival at Utrecht, where he acted as one of the
plenipotentiaries from France, found that the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters had not
received the private in&s;tructions which lady Ma&s;ham gave him rea&s;on to
expect would be &s;ent to them; and he afterwards di&s;covered, that
the agents of the court of St. Germains had made the concerns of
the chevalier the &s;ubject of a private negociation with the mini&s;try in
<PB N="290" REF="305">
England. The&s;e agents were obliged, at la&s;t, to write to the King of
France <Q REND="inline">"in plain terms, that the mini&s;try in England were men of no
honour; that they had held them in &s;u&s;pen&s;e for a long time;
and that now, they not only did not come to the point with them,
but declined any conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject; only &s;aid in general,
that a certain per&s;on would be &s;ent over to Utrecht, who &s;hould di&s;|cour&s;e
by word of mouth freely, and &s;hould &s;ettle that affair &s;o as &s;hould
be agreeable to all parties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minute of Mon&s;ieur Menager's negociation, <HI>p.</HI> 305.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Lady Ma&s;ham, in a letter to Menager, dated St. James's, March 2,
1712, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I take it for granted, that they (the court of St. Ger|mains)
are fallen into the hands of my Lord Trea&s;urer: he loves a &s;ecret,
and is famous for making intricacies, where there is a &s;terility of in|trigues;
and no le&s;s renowned for cau&s;ing every thing of &s;uch a nature
to mi&s;carry. If their a&s;&s;urances are from him, I doubt not, he values
him&s;elf upon having deceived them; and if the per&s;on to be &s;ent to
Utrecht comes from him, I dare promi&s;e you, that when he comes there,
he wants his in&s;tructions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 310.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Menager, who hated all the agents of the court of St. Germains, and
was equally hated by them, &s;ays, that <Q REND="inline">"all this was owing to the im|patience
and jealou&s;y of the court of St. Germains, who, though the
King had agents of his own in London, who, perhaps, did their utmo&s;t,
yet they at St. Germains, being unea&s;y, could not refrain &s;ending a &s;ecret
emba&s;&s;y them&s;elves. This, it &s;eems, was a Scotchman, who pretended
great intere&s;t with a Scotch lord, who was an officer of &s;tate in England;
but either the me&s;&s;enger failed in the intere&s;t he pretended to have, or the
Scotch nobleman failed in what he promi&s;ed to do for him; &s;eeing the
&s;um of his negociation was briefly this; that after a long &s;tay, he per|formed
only there two notable exploits, viz. fir&s;t, that he &s;pent a great
deal of their money; and &s;econdly, that he ruined and expo&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s
which he was entru&s;ted with; and at la&s;t, came away with nothing but
an empty promi&s;e from the &s;aid Scotch lord, that a per&s;on &s;hould be &s;ent
over to negociate that matter with the French and Briti&s;h mini&s;ters toge|ther<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 314.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Menager had &s;trong prejudices again&s;t the earl of Middleton. He
gives the po&s;t&s;cript of a letter he wrote to lady Ma&s;ham. <Q REND="inline">"A Scotch|man
<PB N="291" REF="306">

inquiring who the &s;ecret has remained with, they confe&s;s now, at St.
Germains, that it has really remained with no body: for &s;o ill a choice
did they make of their agent, that he has not only expo&s;ed his errand
but his employer: and our people in London are very free to &s;end word
hither how ill he has acquitted him&s;elf; though, by the way, I mu&s;t
ob&s;erve, that this was not done till after they had been amu&s;ed with the

<P>Menager's account of this negociation appeared &s;o extraordinary, that
it hath hitherto met with little credit from the public; but it will be
found to coincide with what relates to Menzies, under the borrowed
name of Abram in Nairne's letters, and with the account which the well
known John Plunket gives of his own intrigues. He acknowledges,

which I de&s;ired the bearer to let you know I had received it, having no|thing
worth the po&s;tage to tell you, or friends there, but what I know
you had from other hands; yet I neglected not your bu&s;ine&s;s with what
acquaintance I had of little Patrick [the parliament], more e&s;pecially his
cou&s;in Hil&s;on [hou&s;e of commons], whom I found more kind. I hear
cou&s;in Knox [the King] is to leave your town of Rotterdam [St. Germains],
and go either to Am&s;terdam or Toruire, for better trade. You know
Stanhope, the merchant in Shut [Scotland], would put him into pre&s;ent
bu&s;ine&s;s, and he wants &s;uch a one ju&s;t at this time for a book-keeper,
But if you cannot get him in there, what think you of Knowles at Am|&s;terdam
[King of Sweden]; I hope you have not neglected him all this
time; his &s;i&s;ter Su&s;an [the kingdom of Sweden] was always kind to
Knox [the King], and to his brother Scrimger [Scotchmen], who would
not fail going to fee him, if he were &s;o near as I have heard him &s;ay.&mdash;
My humble &s;ervice to Mr. Sands [Mr. Stafford]. Remember me kindly
to Mrs. Emerton [F. Eyre]; and &s;ay &s;omething obliging from me to
hone&s;t Jack&s;on [Mr. Innes]: I have nothing worth their charge for par|ticular

of France is firm in de&s;iring the King's &s;tay, for, although Harley is,
as I have always told you, a Whig, and an enemy to the King, the par|liament
would be friends if they could find a way to &s;how it. But he
cramps all, and makes each man afraid to appear inclined to the intere&s;t
their inclinations would lead them to. All well-inclined are enraged at
Harley's proceedings, and that part of the commons they call the Octo|ber
club of forty. He &s;creens, I mean Mr. Harley, that not any of
the fir&s;t nobility can get an audience, but with the utmo&s;t difficulty; &s;o
that he will govern this affair, I mean the peace, and certainly intends
to make up with Hannover, although at pre&s;ent they differ. But, after
all Hannover's attempts have failed, he will be glad to make up with
Harley. But the be&s;t part of the gentry, and half the nobility, are re|&s;olved
to have the King; the parliament would do it in a year, if it
could be believed he had changed his religion. They would not impo&s;e
it, but would have it reported, to give them a handle: for to change,
on that account, would render him unworthy of wearing what was &s;o
got; but they tell me, they do not de&s;ire it to be done, only &s;aid to be
done.</P>

forerunner, and done as a frolic, till it had rai&s;ed a tumult, and in the
di&s;order to act that part, and Hannover's agent here was in the con&s;ult.
Prince&s;s Anne was terribly frighted, and Harley has got lodgings in her
hou&s;e, and a&s;ter it is dark does not &s;tir out of that hou&s;e: the hone&s;t
men wi&s;h him out of the way, but dare not appear again&s;t the peace,

They are fully per&s;uaded, that he is now very &s;orry that he has not &s;ol|lowed

views. However, pray &s;ee him as &s;oon as you can; and you may very
truly a&s;&s;ure him of the friend&s;hip that Goodall [the King] has for him,
the confidence he has in him, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he expects from him;
for, though his affairs are in a low condition, by rea&s;on of his lo&s;&s;es at &s;ea,

<P>"Mr. Diccon&s;on's draught of a letter which I wrote to Berry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 30.</NOTE> with
a letter of attorney the 3d of April, 1712."</P>
<P>The draught which Mr. Nairne mentions here, is in the earl of Middle|ton's
hand, and as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"THE Queen having &s;ome a&s;&s;urance, that, at this treaty of peace,
her jointure will be allowed her, or rather a pen&s;ion equivalent
to it, her de&s;ign is to make u&s;e of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the receiving of it;
but that matter not being yet &s;ettled, &s;he is not willing to have it pub|lickly
&s;poke of, or to &s;ay any thing further relating to it, than to con&s;ult
about a form for a letter of attorney, or power to authori&s;e you there|unto.</P>
<P>The difficulty con&s;i&s;ts in this, how to avoid owning the government
in what &s;he &s;igns her&s;elf, and yet not to offend it: &s;o that to compa&s;s
the&s;e two points, and yet make the in&s;trument valid, is the matter you
are de&s;ired to advi&s;e with &s;ome judicious council about.</P>
<P>Should the Queen &s;tyle her&s;elf Queen-mother, &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, that will
not be allowed; &s;hould &s;he &s;tyle her&s;elf Queen-dowager, that would be
a le&s;&s;ening of her&s;elf, and a prejudice to the King her &s;on; which &s;he
will never do.</P>
<P>The question is, therefore, whether the in&s;trument may not be good
without any title at all, only the word "We"; (for in as much as it will
be &s;igned Maria R. and &s;ealed with her &s;eal, one would think the per&s;on
<PB N="299" REF="314">
would be &s;ufficiently denoted); but if that be not &s;ufficient, then whe|ther
any other expre&s;&s;ion can be invented to the intent mentioned.</P>
<P>Our council here think &s;he might &s;tyle her&s;elf thus: "Mary, Queen Con|&s;ort
of James the Second, late King of England, Scotland, France, and
Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c." to all unto whom the&s;e pre&s;ents may
come, &s;ends greeting, &amp;c.; and &s;o go on according to the form here in|clo&s;ed.
In fine, you are de&s;ired to advi&s;e about this matter, and &s;end the
re&s;ult, as &s;oon as with convenience you can, that her Maje&s;ty may not
be to &s;eek in &s;o material a point, when the time comes to u&s;e it.</P>
<P>If the inclo&s;ed form, upon other accounts, be improper, plea&s;e &s;end a
draught of &s;uch an one as is thought &s;it; and, if it mu&s;t be drawn upon
&s;tamped paper, plea&s;e to &s;end a &s;heet or two al&s;o.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty is to allow you two hundred pounds a year, as a &s;alary
for this trouble, be&s;ides all incident charges, and is &s;orry her circum|&s;tances
will not permit her to make it more con&s;iderable; however, is
de&s;irous that what advantage was to be had by it, it &s;hould be given to
you, preferable to any other per&s;on, as a mark of her Maje&s;ty's &s;en&s;e of

<P>"MR. Plunket is gone, and you mu&s;t not refu&s;e to meet him, with
all the &s;peed you can, at Mr. Hacket's at Rotterdam. He will
tell you what will be of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the King, and to the
King of France; he is &s;ent by Mr. Harley and the cabinet-council; his
&s;tay may be but &s;hort; you mu&s;t make ha&s;te. I hope the King is in a
condition of health to give his orders to you. My lord Middleton may,
if he plea&s;es, acquaint the King of France's mini&s;ter, Mon&s;ieur de Torcy,
to &s;end one too, or let you bring back what is fit they &s;hould know. By
arts, Mr. Harley has kept Mr. Plunket from going till now; but he cannot
now hinder the King's being e&s;tabli&s;hed; for it is re&s;olved by the parlia|ment
and the leading men. The di&s;covery of the allies and Hannover
have given the blow.</P>
<P>Where the King was to land la&s;t time, is where his friends de&s;ire may
be the place; but things are not ripe yet. Mr. Plunket will let you &s;ee
how all things are carried; and he de&s;ires you may be the per&s;on &s;ent to
meet him. He wrote to you, by my direction; and when you come to
Rotterdam, you mu&s;t not take notice he is Mr. Plunket, but call him
Rogers to the merchant, Mr. Hacket, who does not know him. I need
not de&s;ire this to be the greate&s;t &s;ecret; you will gue&s;s at the rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P>The King of France is &s;ure in the wrong, not to grant us every rea|&s;onable
thing; &s;ince it is re&s;olved to make a &s;eparate peace. The Whigs,
&s;ure, mu&s;t have u&s;ed art to bring them to refu&s;e us good terms, which
would ju&s;tify our leaving the others to treat for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>All the practices I have &s;ent you word of, will be laid before the par|liament.
It has ruined Hannover; he will never come here, if he comes
not now, by the Whigs means, and contrary to the de&s;ire of prince&s;s
Anne and the parliament, and all the body of the church party; the
Dutch dare not venture on &s;uch a pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t write to Mr. Plunket, and inclo&s;e it to Mr. Hacket, and Mr.
Plunket will &s;end for it before you come, that he may know you are com|ing.
Direct your letter for Mr. Rogers.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="317">
Pray know, of my lord Middleton, what account Mon&s;ieur Azlini brought
of what Mr. Plunket gave him to deliver to the King, and be very punctual
in it, if he did de&s;ire that one &s;hould be &s;ent from the King of France.</P>

for I am very well, and have often told you &s;o, could my letters
get to you, which I hope they have long before this, and that Mr. Ma&s;&s;y
[lord Middleton] has had mine in an&s;wer to his la&s;t. I wi&s;h you all hap|pine&s;s
in your new employment, though the occa&s;ion of it was di&s;mal to
all; and you cannot imagine how generally &s;he is lamented, even by
tho&s;e, that have ever been enemies to her family. I and mine have
&s;hared &s;o in your lo&s;s that we thought our &s;orrows could have no addi|tion,
when we heard your Chevalier was recovered; but now we find
our mi&s;take; for, &s;ince we had yours to my daughter Jeany, 'tis &s;aid at
court he is de&s;paired of, and on the Exchange that he is dead; that he
eat too much meat, and got a cold with going out too &s;oon. If this be
true, all hone&s;t people will think no more of this world; for &s;ure never
was mortals &s;o unfortunate as we. You may gue&s;s at our condition;
which, by the wor&s;t of natures, would be pitied. Your doctor gave us
hopes, la&s;t night, there was no good grounds for &s;uch reports; but whom
to believe, or what to think, our concern is too great to know; but every
moment we are either going or &s;ending to inquire for comfort, but find
none yet. Pray Heaven this day gives us &s;ome, for the wind is fairer for
it. I beg you will make my condoling compliment, for to write it my|&s;elf
to your only mi&s;tre&s;s is tormenting her now; but pray a&s;&s;ure her I
grieve for her lo&s;s, and the &s;en&s;e I am &s;ure &s;he has of it, to a degree not

be remembered when you make my compliments; for he is more con|cerned

This is to acknowledge the receipt of two of your letters. I would

<P>"I Had yours, la&s;t night, of the 21&s;t, to give me the fatal news of that
worthy lady. I was like a poor di&s;tracted thing as I am, &amp;c."</P>
<P>"If I did not know the King's affairs perfectly well, your fears would
have ca&s;t me to the gates of death. No, no. All is as my heart can
wi&s;h; and I am not ea&s;ily content with every little affair concerning him.
Take my word, all is right, and will &s;oon bear. All his friends are
earne&s;t for his changing his lodgings, and rejoice he is to leave France.
I confe&s;s it &s;trikes a damp &s;ometimes upon me; but I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his
lawyers, who know be&s;t what he is to do. Alas! I was to-day to have
&s;ent him a pacquet from his friend, but he has delayed it till I hear again.
O! what is my dear angel doing at this time? He repre&s;ents him&s;elf al|ways
to me as my ble&s;&s;ed &s;aviour. Men and angels cannot tell the
heart I bear to him. I hope God will pity me, and pre&s;erve him.
I know that is all that is wanting, and that you will &s;oon &s;ee. I
hope you are to go with him to his new hou&s;e, and pray God for
it; it will put me out of all my &s;en&s;es, if I do not often hear of you
and from him; and, to be &s;ure, nobody will be &s;o kind and &s;o careful as
I now find you are. I thank you ten thou&s;and times. For God's &s;ake,
continue it to me. Is he not my all on earth? It is like a mill-&s;tone about
my neck to keep me from writing him. If we do not hear any more bad
news, we will write on Friday, and I mu&s;t beg of you to repre&s;ent E.
M&mdash;r's faithful duty to him, and tell him, I am &s;ure he would give
500 guineas, at this moment, for a thing he promi&s;ed: he &s;aid it was
both for his own &s;ake and mine, and he does this day pity me at
his heart. I have no eyes in my head, but that which look like red
blood. We parted about an hour ago. He kept the fir&s;t illne&s;s from
me, till I had yours. When I had yours of the 3d, I was for coming to
&s;ee him, and roared and cried I would do it; and I told him I would
not de&s;ire to &s;tay but four days with him, and I would be back before
his affairs wanted me; but E. M&mdash;r told me, the world could not
&s;ave my life, I would die before I was two days journey. I &s;aid if I
<PB N="305" REF="320">
died coming back I did not care, but I was &s;ure I would not die in the
going; the joy to &s;ee my dear angel would &s;upport me. All my friends
in general were again&s;t it; but it was to E. M&mdash;r I was to &s;ubmit.
I had intere&s;t enough to have come the &s;hort way. I tru&s;t in God I &s;hall
&s;ee him &s;oon, and give me the &s;atisfaction to a&s;&s;ure him of my humble
duty, and leave my poor heart with him. I am &s;orry to trouble you

<P>"I Was &s;at down, with great delight, this day &s;ev'night, to rejoice with
you in the happy recovery, as I then thought, of our two friends
[the King and prince&s;s], when a report was brought me in of what, God
knows, has been too well confirmed &s;ince, and which made the pen fall
from my hand. Well! God's will mu&s;t be obeyed, and we mu&s;t be
truly thankful, as we ought, for the &s;afety of one, who mu&s;t now be
doubly dear to us, and is, indeed, our only comfort and hopes. I will
not undertake to tell you what his friends have felt during the event of
&s;o doubtful a di&s;temper; when, even tho&s;e who are le&s;s &s;o, have ex|pre&s;&s;ed
a concern upon this occa&s;ion. Should there be the lea&s;t remains

of them, and your frequent accounts of late, which hone&s;t Mr. Rye

us &s;o very &s;en&s;ibly, that public affairs have lo&s;t their ta&s;te; nor indeed, if
I was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, is there much to &s;ay. A peace is no ways doubted to
be well advanced; but whether the negociations at Utrecht contribute
much to it, is more than I can &s;ay. The hou&s;e of commons is &s;um|moned,

tell you how he longs for his pre&s;ent, although he &s;ays, he has no doubt
of &s;eeing the original in a &s;hort time. I am &s;ure he takes true pains for
it, and this is doing him ju&s;tice. All your friends and corre&s;pondents
may do that piece of right, to own it is he of all the Scots has the be&s;t
intere&s;t with Q. Anne and E. Oxford; and al&s;o he is believed by the
Engli&s;h as a good and great lawyer, and a man of much goodne&s;s and
honour. If he was not my kin&s;man and dear friend, I would &s;ay much
more; but that I can ju&s;tify. His being a faithful attorney to you, is
perfection enough to make him happy in this world and in the next; a
good con&s;cience is the world's ea&s;e; and I am &s;ure, 'tis a great ea&s;e to
my poor heart, to &s;ee the friend&s;hip of your creditors increa&s;e every day,
and it will bring you with ea&s;e to town, when your debts will be com|pounded,
and I am well informed not to be unea&s;y at your leaving
France. It is the &s;afe&s;t way to bring you to your own; and that you
are not to &s;tay long in any &s;ettled place till then, only tour about till
your debts are near paid; and the parting word between E. M. and me,
when he went to his country-hou&s;e, was to beg me to chear up my &s;pi|rits,
I &s;hould &s;ee my be&s;t beloved, and that he would then tell all my

Jenkins [the King], with &s;afety to them&s;elves; but the current running

[Plunket] conceiving they wanted but a plau&s;ible handle to ju&s;tify &s;uch

<P>Accordingly, being intimate as well with Mr. Goodman as with all

into any accommodation with Mr. Maine [King of France], in order to do
Mr. Jenkins [the King] ju&s;tice, and produced the vouchers from time to

to treat with him at all hazards; whereupon, Rogers [Plunket]
was pitched upon, as an indifferent man, to deliver a me&s;&s;age to Mr.
Maine [the King of France] to that purpo&s;e. But, upon &s;econd thoughts,
he being found more u&s;eful and capable of rendering further &s;ervice here,
Mr. Sim&s;on &s;ent another that was a creature of his own; but, in the
meantime, Mr. Maine [the King of France] &s;ent hither one Mr. Ciprian,
in order to try the &s;i&s;ter [prince&s;s Anne] and Mr. Sim&s;on's pul&s;es, which
Mr. Rogers [Plunket] communicated to Mr. Sim&s;on, wherewith he
&s;eemed to be well-plea&s;ed, whereby a true under&s;tanding was &s;ettled be|tween
them, which has been the foundation of the pre&s;ent agreement

<P>Mr. Williams's ma&s;ter [prince Eugene's], having a dark notion of the

<P>"YOUR la&s;t letter has given me a great deal of concern, becau&s;e I
do believe it had been of great con&s;equence to the cau&s;e in Chan|cery,
that you &s;hould have &s;ettled the accounts with Mr. Rogers. He
could have told you what the be&s;t coun&s;ellors had &s;aid to him, upon his
laying the merits of the cau&s;e before them, Mr. Tom We&s;t [lord Mul|grave]
who is a friend to Mr. Jenkins [the King] told Mr. Roger
[Plunket] that what he had informed him of, would do Mrs. Be&s;s Smith
[England] the greate&s;t &s;ervice that had been done her ever &s;ince the &s;uit
began, (which has been the&s;e twenty odd years), and Mrs. Be&s;s Smith
[England] has very nobly rewarded him for that &s;ervice; for it has di&s;|covered
<PB N="314" REF="329">
covered Mr. Sandys's [Hannover's] practi&s;es, and laid them open, which
would have ruined Mrs. Dibby [prince&s;s Anne] who abhors him now.
Mr. Rogers [Plunket] did believe, that young man [Mr. Sheridan] was
&s;ent by Mr. Peregrine [Fergu&s;on] to Mr. Jenkins [the King], becau&s;e
Mr. Peregrine [Fergu&s;on] did acquaint Mr. Tom. We&s;t [L. Mul.] of
Mr. Rogers's bu&s;ine&s;s, unknown to Mr. Rogers; for he had taken mea|&s;ures
to have it laid before the friends in Mr. Medlicot's family [the par|liament];
and the pleading fir&s;t council [cab. coun.], both at a time,
when he found Mr. Hans [Harley] concealed all from them; but when
Mr. Peregrine [Fergu&s;on] had taken that way, Rogers was &s;atisfied,
though he was not privy to the doing it, for it had the end he wi&s;hed;
and in a little time it will be laid before Mr. Medlicote him&s;elf [the
parliament], though he is very tender in openly expo&s;ing Mr.
Sandys [Hannover], becau&s;e of the tenants love to him yet; but
all the others, that are injointly with him, will be openly expo&s;ed,
which will ju&s;tify Mrs. Be&s;s Smith [England] acting apart from them;
a greater &s;ervice could not be done to Mr. St. John [the King] than this
has been. Mr. Tom We&s;t [lord M.] has been informed, that Mr.
Wealy of the country of Mr. Peregrine [the Scots Whigs] has &s;ent to
Mr. Sandys [Hannover] to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t Mr. Carres [Church of Eng|land],
and de&s;ired him to come to them; therefore, now Mr. Carres has
no better way, than by Mr. Jenkins [the King] to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice;
and that is what he is re&s;olved on. But the many difficulties he mu&s;t go
through, is what they are labouring under, becau&s;e of the jointure Mrs.
Dian Johns [prince&s;s Anne] has upon the e&s;tate; and after her death
it will be too late, becau&s;e of the entail that will then take place. Mr.
Peregrine would have had Mr. Rogers to have let him have managed it;
to have a friend of his to have come to him, to &s;ettle the accounts, and
&s;aid, Mr. James Staff [Mr. Stafford] would, he believed, come him&s;elf to
&s;ettle the accounts with Mr. Rogers [Plunket]; but he having given
Mrs. White direction to write to you, he would not alter that; &s;o that
he will be di&s;appointed extremely, becau&s;e, for many rea&s;ons, he cannot
do it, by writing at a di&s;tance; be&s;ides, you may gue&s;s how impo&s;&s;ible it
is to direct you, by writing all the particulars of what he would let you
under&s;tand, for he knows a great deal of the affairs of the entailed
e&s;tate. He &s;aid, he did not acquaint the young man [Mr. Sheridan] of
<PB N="315" REF="330">
any thing, not believing him a proper per&s;on; but Mr. Peregrine hav|ing
done that to Mr. Tom We&s;t [lord Mulgrave], he believed, by the
young man's going of a &s;udden then, away he had &s;ent him; but Mr.
Rogers has no patron [cut paper], and cannot get the work done any
other way, effectually; &s;o you will not have the work. I fear he is,
what I told you, expecting Mr. Sam Hamey [Sir William Ellis]; he will
write to him: Mrs. White gave him a direction how to write. He,
poor man, is in danger in that ill air, con&s;idering his weakly con&s;ti|tution,
&s;o he will &s;tay as little a time as he can; but he has much to do,
being fully apprized of his bu&s;ine&s;s, from the fir&s;t hands. I believe there
could be nothing of greater u&s;e in the cau&s;e, than your &s;ending this ac|count
with him; but &s;ince that, you &s;ay, cannot be done, pray write to
him, and let him know the rea&s;on, and tell him how you think it ought
to be done. Direct for Mr. Rogers as you &s;end Mrs. White's, to be de|livered
to him by Mr. Hacket; &s;o you and he mu&s;t do it the be&s;t way
you can; the term is now, and it will be a great damage to tho&s;e you value
mo&s;t, not to know how to in&s;truct the coun&s;el. Your friend Mr. Mat|thews,
tells me, that he has writ to you. He is now in Mr. Medlecot's
family [Scotch parliament], and that more than half of tho&s;e children,
wi&s;h us well, as he does the pro&s;perity of your cou&s;in St. John [the
King]; but they were deceived in this la&s;t affair, in relation to Mr. Jen|kins
[the King] by Mr. Hans [Mr. Harley], and hate him heartily for it;
But you know, they mu&s;t take no notice of it, but are re&s;olved to make
what reparation they can, and as &s;oon as they can do it. Mr. Peregrine
is ordered to receive 100 <HI>l.</HI> for laying the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mr. Rogers before
the lawyers [cabinet council]. Mr. Tom We&s;t [duke of Buckingham]
has got it done, on that account, by Mrs. Debby's [prince&s;s Anne's] direc|tions.
I have not &s;een him a great while, he and I being long &s;ick."</P>

would have the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s with the former, and that my &s;tay would be
of no advantage to them, as my pre&s;ence &s;erves only to four the minds of
the mini&s;try; and, in order to di&s;engage my&s;elf the more from them,
I communicated to them the &s;entiments of the Grand Pen&s;ionary, upon
the clau&s;e which I &s;ent to you, in my di&s;patches of the 25th and 29th of
January. They an&s;wered me abruptly; and among the re&s;t, the Duke
<PB N="319" REF="334">
of Marlborough, that the grand Pen&s;ionary had changed his &s;entiments
very &s;oon, &s;ince he began to be apprehen&s;ive of di&s;obliging a handful of
factious members in the hou&s;e of commons, and to be afraid of a mini&s;try
who are pen&s;ioners of France, and con&s;equently enemies to the common
cau&s;e, and will continue &s;o as long as they &s;ub&s;i&s;t. It &s;eems to me, that
the States have already forgot, that they formerly re&s;i&s;ted France and
England at once; and if I am not mi&s;taken, they will find them&s;elves
&s;oon in the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity. <Q REND="inline">"Yes," &s;ays baron Bothmar, "of &s;ending
thither the prince of Hannover, as they &s;ent the prince of Orange, to de|liver
the nation and to prevent the ruin of the common cau&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>They urged me in&s;tantly to &s;end you the following particulars to be
added to tho&s;e, which I &s;ent you in my di&s;patches of 25 and 29 of Ja|nuary,
and to make up a memorial of them, to be printed there fir&s;t, as it
might then be printed here without any &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>The Queen of England upon her acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, declared
the following particulars.</P>
<P>That trade being the &s;upport of the nation, and &s;he having religion
&s;o much at heart, had made no difficulty of engaging in this war,
though the nation was then in debt, being well convinced, that &s;he could
not be &s;ecure upon the throne, while Spain was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
hou&s;e of Bourbon; and &s;he had engaged her&s;elf deeper in this war than
&s;he had at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, to the great detriment of her kingdoms.</P>
<P>But the mea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try &s;ufficiently &s;hew, that they
were not hearty in the cau&s;e from the beginning, and that the mo&s;t di&s;|cerning
&s;ee very well, that every thing tends to a &s;eparate peace, and to
pave the way more ea&s;ily for her brother. I told them, that appeared
very probable; but that the Pen&s;ionary would &s;tart the &s;ame objections,
as baron Bothmar did not think proper to undertake &s;uch a delicate affair
without communicating it to his ma&s;ter; and that it is now too late to
produce any great effect, as the people in England were already bia&s;&s;ed
by the re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e of commons; but the junto made the
following an&s;wer: <Q REND="inline">"by this method of proceeding, we &s;hall never &s;uc|ceed,
for you made the &s;ame objection to the loans which we had pro|po&s;ed
from the bank and from rich merchants, by engaging the revenue
of the kingdom of Hungary, and other hereditary dominions; and by
that means, the Emperor would find him&s;elf in a condition, jointly
<PB N="320" REF="335">
with the States-general, of be&s;ieging a town, and at the &s;ame time, taking
the field, by which, of con&s;equence, he would put an end to the ce&s;&s;ation
of arms, and infallibly break up the conferences at Utrecht, and di&s;po&s;e
the people to believe all the projects that might be formed. I imagine
we have &s;till time enough to in&s;ert this in the memorial."</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wered them, that we were fooli&s;hly employed in building the
tower of Babel, for there are not three among you or us of the &s;ame
&s;entiment. Sometimes you would choo&s;e to have the prince of Hanno|ver,
and &s;ometimes you would not; and I &s;ee that the greate&s;t number of
you are for an ari&s;tocracy; and what vexes me mo&s;t is, that you have
obliged the Emperor to make demands, from the greate&s;t part of which
he will be obliged to de&s;i&s;t."</P>

<P>"Since my la&s;t to you I had two letters from London, wherein I am
de&s;ired not to &s;tir from hence till orders from Mr. Han [Harley];
and if I can &s;end over the fellow, and not to appear in that matter my|&s;elf,
for weighty rea&s;ons, which I &s;hall know hereafter. The Engli&s;h of
this I take to be, that they are for having that man over, in order to
&s;top his mouth, or lay him a&s;ide, &s;o that he can do no &s;ervice to Mr.
Jenkins [the King]. By the la&s;t letter I am de&s;ired to tell my friend,
the re&s;ident for the Emperor, that the Engli&s;h court is willing to make
up the breaches and keep a good corre&s;pondence for the future, pro|vided
they come into the pre&s;ent mini&s;try's mea&s;ures: this I communi|cated
to the &s;aid re&s;ident this morning, who &s;eemed well plea&s;ed with it.
How far this will be conducive to Mr. Jenkins [the King's] intere&s;t, or
Mr. Jacob's [King of France's] affairs, I leave you to judge. We &s;hall
now think of the propere&s;t method to bring this thing to bear. If Mr.
Jacob's [the King of France's] manager thinks this accommodation will
affect: his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, let him &s;peak to me in time. I believe it will
do good to Mr. Jenkins [the King], &s;eeing die Emperor &s;eems &s;atisfied as
<PB N="321" REF="336">
things &s;tand now. He &s;hould have his own; but if he thinks this ac|commodation
will in the lea&s;t prejudice him, it &s;hall go no further. I
had no more papers come. I &s;ent again this po&s;t for them. I am, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I &s;han't &s;end the fellow to London, but rather di&s;po&s;e him to come
into our intere&s;t, and, by this means, keep Harris [Harley] in awe, and
make him more pliable; for he knows none can do him more harm, at
pre&s;ent, than I. The&s;e two points ought to be re&s;erved for hands of
higher reach than mine; therefore I &s;hould have the help of good heads
while I am here: it is not every day &s;uch opportunities as the&s;e offer."</P>

four; and, in doubtful ca&s;es, it is &s;ufficient to prove the fact, and learn|ed

<P>"What is more evident than that Cra&s;&s;us [Hannover], with the Ped|lars
[the Dutch] and the Tartars [Whigs], have declared again&s;t Tho|mas
[Queen Anne] and his lawyers [mini&s;try], and that there is no means
to ward that blow but by doing ju&s;tice to Richard [Pretender]? One
mu&s;t want both &s;en&s;e and manners to mi&s;tru&s;t &s;uch eminent per&s;ons; and
it would be as ab&s;urd to in&s;truct them in the ways and means of manag|ing
a matter &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for their own &s;ecurity, and the advantage of
their pupil Canaan. As for in&s;tance, would it not be a &s;trange pre&s;ump|tion
to tell them that delays are dangerous, that if Thomas [Queen
Anne] &s;hould die, whom God pre&s;erve, Cra&s;&s;us [Hannover] mu&s;t cer|tainly
get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e the decrees made in his favour, though un|ju&s;t,
could never in that ca&s;e be rever&s;ed? That Richard is a per&s;on of
too much &s;pirit to &s;ubmit, but would immediately appear armed, with
equity, and &s;upported by many good friends and relations, to a&s;&s;ert his
right; &s;o that the e&s;tate in debate would be utterly ruined, and the pre|&s;ent
lawyers [mini&s;try] could not e&s;cape the rage of Tartars [Whigs];
and that though Croe&s;us's [Marlborough's] ca&s;e be not &s;o de&s;perate, yet it
cannot be doubted but he wi&s;hes he had made better u&s;e of his time.</P>
<P>That the &s;ure&s;t way to prevent the&s;e mi&s;eries, is for Thomas [Queen]
to &s;end a letter of attorney [treaty] to his brother Richard [Pretender];
and when that is &s;igned, to call him home immediately, when the troops
[parliament] are di&s;per&s;ed in their re&s;pective quarters: that this merry
meeting mu&s;t be at Sir Roger's [London], to make it more &s;olemn and
&s;ecure, by &s;urpri&s;ing the Tartars [Whigs] in their head quarters, by a good
guard of Jani&s;aries [Tories]: that tho&s;e who never had a good
thought of Richard [Pretender] would crowd to embrace him, and tell
him, as they did his uncle, that it is the happy day they all wi&s;hed for:
<PB N="324" REF="339">
that when the troops [parliament] were a&s;&s;embled, and the brothers
&s;hould appear together, they, no doubt, would not only applaud what
had been done, but would make a &s;ecure title to the e&s;tate: that it would
be dangerous to begin with the troops; for, be&s;ides the ca&s;e of mortality
already mentioned, they are fickle and humour&s;ome; and even the Ja|ni&s;aries
them&s;elves are jealous of one another.</P>
<P>That there is more prudence, and as much courage &s;hown in prevent|ing
danger, than by running into it: many great occa&s;ions have been
lo&s;t by too much caution; whereas, by &s;tealing a march the &s;ecret is
kept, and the enemy found unprepared: that for that end and purpo&s;e,
Richard [Pretender] &s;hould be as advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted as can be, to
prevent Cra&s;&s;us [Hannover] in ca&s;e of the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations, and many more, would be &s;uper&s;luous to be
offered to &s;uch vigilant, clear-&s;ighted lawyers, which is the beginning
and end of this &s;crible."</P>

with Gourney [Marlborough]; told him how dangerous it would be, at
this time, to give any jealou&s;y to Young [Prince&s;s Anne] or Baker
[Harley]: that the journey was not fixed yet, neither as to the day nor
place: that what he advi&s;ed of the duke of Lorrain making difficulty,
was probable enough: that it were to be wi&s;hed Young and Baker
would con&s;ider well the danger of di&s;tance and delay; and that they
would lo&s;e no time to &s;horten Goodall's [the King's] travels, and ha&s;ten

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 19, 1712.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"IF you knew all that has happened to me, you would not wonder at
my &s;ilence hitherto; but if Mr. Hall's health could have permitted
his coming to you, the King would have had the be&s;t accounts which the
duke of Hamilton could have &s;ent; but you cannot imagine, as things
are at pre&s;ent, the difficulty of tru&s;ting any one, people are grown &s;o
<PB N="325" REF="340">
corrupt. I was &s;orry to find, by yours of the 19th, to Moncrief, that
the King was kept &s;o much in the dark; for, though we are &s;o here, I
did not doubt but Queen Anne had explained matters fully, with relation
to the King of England, to the King of France, and he to his Britannic
Maje&s;ty. Will not you &s;end me a new addre&s;s, and I &s;hall explain mat|ters?
I a&s;ked one from Le&s;ly, who gave it, but I dur&s;t not u&s;e it here|after,
upon account 161, or hope or hobby. But what is &s;aid now is
more to try if it comes &s;afe, than any thing el&s;e: oppo&s;ite to 113 &s;et
Abb&eacute; Gaultier, or Col&s;ton.</P>
<P>If 231 is not, I am indifferent to other things: compliments are not
nece&s;&s;ary, where deeds &s;hall give conviction of fidelity. If the King of
France remembers 33, he will not refu&s;e the duke of Hamilton; and he
hopes that the King of England will intere&s;t him&s;elf for him, and the
Queen likewi&s;e. The duke of Hamilton has been much pre&s;&s;ed to go
amba&s;&s;ador to Vienna; but lately in&s;inuations have been made to him,
as if they would &s;end him to Philip after the peace; but he did not choo&s;e
to engage him&s;elf in any thing, until he knew the King's &s;entiments upon
it; he will do in that what he thinks fit.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs gives more hopes than any particular
man can tell you. But if the King will let the duke of Hamilton know
with whom he may communicate him&s;elf here, he will &s;peak without
re&s;erve to them. Place Richard Hamilton oppo&s;ite to 129, or Hu&s;ie.
I am &s;ure I have wearied you now, for it is long &s;ince I u&s;ed this way of

concern,<MILESTONE N="July." UNIT="month"> as I truly love him, and de&s;ign him my heir, notwith&s;tanding
the difference of religion; but al&s;o from the great difficulty of giving an
opinion, where I do not well under&s;tand the law. Yet, that I may
leave nothing undone, I mu&s;t &s;ay it is my opinion, that the chief matter
is to regain my brother's [prince&s;s Anne's] good liking. I &s;hall, there|fore,
mention &s;uch &s;teps as I think Harry [the King] may be&s;t take to
plea&s;e his uncle [prince&s;s Anne], and, at the &s;ame time, get the good will
of the old &s;ervants and tenants, who I find in general much better
inclined to Harry [the King] than to his cou&s;in [Hannover]. You
know the fir&s;t di&s;like my brother [prince&s;s Anne] took, was upon Harry's
[the King's] changing his religion; though, as I have often told him, it
was no more than he might expect from the manner of &s;ending him abroad;
for I did not think &s;o very young a man, indeed you know he was a very
boy when he went, &s;hould be tru&s;ted altogether to his own conduct, and the
event hath &s;hewn my fears were not in vain. Yet my brother [prince&s;s
Anne] will not &s;o much as own any imprudence, far le&s;s any fault, as I
think it, in this management; and whenever I touch upon this &s;tring, I
can very &s;eldom get any other an&s;wer, than, <Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee he doth not make
the lea&s;t &s;tep to oblige me. I have no rea&s;on to think he values me or my
e&s;tate, and therefore I am re&s;olved to give it to Dick [Hannover]."</Q> Once,
indeed, I was ob&s;erving to him, that my cou&s;in Richard [Hannover] fre|quently
abu&s;ed his be&s;t &s;ervants; that he often &s;hewed very little re&s;pect
for him&s;elf; that he &s;eemed to me, by his behaviour, to think it not
in his power to alter the will he had made; and that, underhand, he
gave him all the ob&s;tructions he could in the management of his e&s;tate,
for no other rea&s;on, that I could &s;ee, but becau&s;e he could not put what
&s;ervants he had a mind about him; that, for my part, I &s;hould not think
it &s;afe to have &s;ervants near me recommended by a per&s;on of Dick's
[Hannover's] temper; and that Harry [the King] never offered anything
like this. I am &s;en&s;ible this made a very great impre&s;&s;ion on my brother
[prince&s;s Anne]; for he replied very ha&s;tily, <Q REND="inline">"What would&s;t have
me do, Jack [lord Mulgrave]; you know, as the law &s;tands, a Papi&s;t
cannot inherit; and, therefore, &s;hould I alter my will, it would be to no
purpo&s;e, the law would give it all to Dick [Hannovr], and therefore I
had better do that with a good grace, that I cannot help."</Q> I told him
then, I believed Dick [Hannover] him&s;elf was no better than a Papi&s;t:
<PB N="329" REF="344">
that I had good grounds to &s;u&s;pect him, for I never &s;aw him at church
in my life, nor did I ever hear he went thither; and certainly a Papi&s;t
was better than one of no religion at all. I then &s;aid, that I had been
told, that, by deeds of tru&s;t, and by other devices, the lawyers often
found means to evade the act of parliament; and I do not doubt, but if
he would give good fees and good encouragement, the law would &s;peak
whatever he would have it: that the lawyers never &s;uffered an act
to be made without a loop-hole to creep out at, and I believed it was
&s;o in this ca&s;e. Be&s;ides, brother, &s;aid I, you know Dick hath not the
reputation of being the be&s;t hu&s;band in the world: but, added I then,
this his wife's behaviour too well excu&s;eth; yet, at the &s;ame time, give
me leave to tell you, brother, this doth not &s;o much commend your &s;et|tlement,
&s;ince it is plain you have no certainty that Dick's children
are his own. This made him very unea&s;y, and he &s;aid upon it, <Q REND="inline">"you
mu&s;t not believe all that is reported upon that &s;ubject. However, be
that as it may, I do not &s;ee how I can undo, what I my&s;elf have done,
and done in &s;uch a manner: Harry [the King] may thank him&s;elf for it.
He knows I always loved him better than Dick [Hannover]."</Q> I could
not think it proper to pre&s;s further at this time, but rather cho&s;e to leave
him to his own reflections on what had pa&s;&s;ed, and, in the mean time, I
will con&s;ult &s;ome good lawyers what can be&s;t be done in &s;uch a ca&s;e. I
am convinced, that if Harry [the King] would return to the church of
England, all would be ea&s;y; nay, for what I know, if he would but
barely give hopes he would do &s;o, my brother [prince&s;s Anne] would do
all he can to leave him his e&s;tate. I am &s;atisfied he hates Dick [Han|nover],
and loves Harry [the King] now rather better than ever.</P>
<P>I was in the country about a month &s;ince, and could not but be plea&s;ed
to &s;ee how almo&s;t all the tenants care&s;&s;ed me; on my con&s;cience, it was
for Harry's [the King's] &s;ake, who&s;e part they know I always take. Old
Tom Simmonds [lord Mulgrave] told me a thou&s;and &s;tories of Dick
[Hannover], and &s;wore when his lea&s;e was up, that he would not renew
again, if Dick [Hannover] had the e&s;tate. Ah! Ma&s;ter, &s;aid he, if
Ma&s;ter Harry [the King] was not a Papi&s;t, we would &s;oon give Mr.
Richard [Hannover] his belly-full of law; we would all turn tenants to
Mr. Harry [the King], and &s;ee whether Mr. Richard's [Hannover's] an|nuities
would hold out again&s;t &s;uch an e&s;tate; i'faith he &s;hould have
<PB N="330" REF="345">
enough of law before he &s;hould &s;et a foot here. You certainly remember
old Tom [lord Mulgrave]; he is worth, at lea&s;t, 5000<HI>l.</HI> which he hath
got by his own indu&s;try; and I verily believe he &s;peaks the hearts and
minds of his fellows.</P>
<P>By what is above, you will pretty plainly perceive my [lord Mulgrave's]
opinion, and I would have Harry [the King] remember he is not the
fir&s;t of his family who have thought a good e&s;tate worth changing an opi|nion
for, and ten thou&s;and pounds a year is a pretty thing for a young
fellow to play withal; but if his &s;cruples are &s;o very &s;trong, that he can|not
go this length, let him endeavour to try to make his uncle [prince&s;s
Anne] believe, at lea&s;t, that he is in him&s;elf de&s;irous to come back,
but is a&s;hamed, left the world &s;hould think he changes his religion for an
e&s;tate, which he will hardly get quietly, if at all, without it. Pray tell
him this in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, and that I my&s;elf [lord Mulgrave],
though my fondne&s;s makes me overlook it, would be very glad that he
was of my opinion; much more, he may well think, is expected by my
brother [prince&s;s Anne], who is, and ever was, very ob&s;tinate in all his
opinions: if, therefore, Harry [the King] can prevail upon him&s;elf to do
as much on his &s;ide as I will do on mine, I by no means de&s;pair of per|&s;uading
my brother [prince&s;s Anne] to con&s;ent to let him go live on the
e&s;tate in York&s;hire [Scotland] where he hath mo&s;t friends; and when he
is once there, the re&s;t will &s;urely follow at my brother's [prince&s;s Anne's]
death, who I mu&s;t tell you by the bye, notwith&s;tanding his care to hide
it, I can perceive to be &s;o infirm, that it well behoves Harry [the King] to
be &s;peedy in his re&s;olutions, left Dick [Hannover] &s;hould, in that ca&s;e,
get into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion before him, which, by the help of God, he &s;hall never
do, at lea&s;t without a law-&s;uit; but then Harry [the King] mu&s;t join,
or nothing effectual can be hoped for. Pray give him my kind love, and
de&s;ire him carefully to con&s;ider his old uncle's advice, and to take this with
him, that I find he can hardly depend upon the tenants a&s;&s;i&s;tance, whil&s;t
he continues the opinion he is of; and that whoever tells him the con|trary,
deceives him; my a&s;&s;i&s;tance and firm friend&s;hip he may be mo&s;t &s;ure
of at all events, and in all circum&s;tances. Tell him likewi&s;e, and I have
pretty good means to know it, that my brother [prince&s;s Anne] and his
be&s;t &s;ervants are now &s;o angry at Dick's [Hannover's] late in&s;olence, that
if Harry [the King] will but put it in their power to help him, they will
<PB N="331" REF="346">
do all they can for him; and I do not know but my brother [prince&s;s
Anne] may go &s;o far as try his intere&s;t to get an act of parliament to
&s;ettle the e&s;tate on him, which, in my con&s;cience, he hath friends enow to
obtain, if he will go heartily about it. Adieu. Love me as I do you."</P>

<P>"IT is &s;ome time &s;ince one Plumtree, an attorney of this town, in|formed
you that he had put into my hands &s;ome papers which might,
hereafter, prove of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to Mr. Knox [the King] and
Mr. Kennedy [King of France]. Having my&s;elf lately been obliged to
<PB N="332" REF="347">
make a journey into the North, I had put the&s;e papers into the cu&s;tody
of a friend, who being him&s;elf ab&s;ent at my return, I could not get
them back till lately. After looking them over, as attentively as I could,
I cannot &s;ee how they can be of any great u&s;e hereafter, unle&s;s it be as
a proof of the zeal and indu&s;try of the per&s;on who collected them, and
who, as far as I can judge, had chiefly in view the &s;ervice and advan|tage
of Mr. Kirkton [the King]. That gentleman can be&s;t tell how far
his intere&s;ts are linked with that of Mr. Putney's [the peace]; but it can|not
be doubted but the latter has been much forwarded in his affairs
by the light tho&s;e papers have given Hender&s;on [Harley], who thereby
di&s;covered the knavery of Edward [Emperor], and his ingratitude to
Quanton [Queen Anne] and Eden [England], and his clo&s;e union with
Wi&s;hart [the Whigs]. This, Sir, is all that I can &s;ay at this di&s;tance;
but I &s;hall take particular care to pre&s;erve the premi&s;es till we meet, as
I hope we one day &s;hall, I &s;uppo&s;e you expect that every letter from
hence &s;hould bring you a great deal of news; but in&s;tead of that, I can
only tell you that our affairs are managed with greater &s;ecrecy than ever,
which I think is one important proof that the changes made &s;ome time
&s;ince, have been for the better; and I believe we &s;hall be daily more and
more convinced of this: for though the Whigs talk big, they lo&s;e
ground vi&s;ibly, and the calumnies which they continually throw on the
Queen and mini&s;try, with the utmo&s;t efforts of malice and impudence,
have little effect on the body of the people, who heartily long for peace
and Dunkirk, which we hope is, as this day, in Engli&s;h hands. The
Whigs do all they can to po&s;&s;e&s;s the people with a notion that there are
evil de&s;igns on foot again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and they are even malicious
enough to give out, that Scotland is, by the peace, to be yielded to the
Chevalier de St. George; but there is nobody &s;imple enough to give ear
to &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions. All friends here are well, except Rowley [Rivers],
who is dying, and poor Sanders [lord Somers] who cannot live long,
and is already dead in effect, to the great grief of Harry [Hannover]
who depends more on him than on any one friend be&s;ides. I hope, Sir,
you will do me the ju&s;tice to believe that I am, with the greate&s;t re&s;pect

<P>"THE thoughts I had of changing place are now over, at lea&s;t for
&s;ome time; the pre&s;ent world is in &s;o troubled a po&s;ture, one
would be glad to &s;ee it &s;ettle a little. In the mean time I will give you
the be&s;t account I am able of our private affairs: poor Mr. Matthew
Turner [the low-church] and partners are upon their la&s;t legs; and if,
in two or three months, they are not able to give &s;ome new turn to their
bu&s;ine&s;s, which mu&s;t be by &s;ome notable trick of youth [rebellion], their
great dealing will dwindle to nothing, and their name be almo&s;t forgot
upon the Change. To do them right they are not idle; and yet I hardly
think they will make any great venture; or if they &s;hould, I hope we may
be able to turn it to &s;ome profit in our way; for, indeed, the &s;truggles and
endeavours they and Mr. Diederick Gould [Hannover] have hitherto made,
have been very u&s;eful to us, and brought our bu&s;ine&s;s into credit; &s;o
that I have often thought we have as good &s;ervice from tho&s;e that do not
love us, as even our be&s;t friends. What bu&s;ine&s;s Mr. Stephen Co&s;en
[Mr. Thomas Harley] may be employed in to Mr. Diederick [Hannover]
I cannot &s;ay; but I am very much mi&s;taken if it be at all complied with,
be it what it will, &s;uch is that gentleman's temper and pre&s;ent humour.
You will wonder when I tell you, that Mynheer Klaas [the King of France]
begins to come into good bu&s;ine&s;s, and to be mentioned in the city, as a
<PB N="334" REF="349">
very hone&s;t man, and a fair dealer. The giving up his intere&s;t in Mr.
Barty's hou&s;e [Dunkirk] to accommodate his friends Mr. Ezekiel White
and partner [the high-church party] has given him great reputation, and
will &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h his trade here, that our old corre&s;pondents [the Dutch
and the re&s;t of the allies], will either be obliged to come into it, or we
&s;hall leave them to them&s;elves, if not wor&s;e. I mu&s;t not forget to ac|quaint
you how great &s;atisfaction Mr. Kreely's [King of England] ma|nagement,
of late, has given here: friends and foes all &s;peak of it, tho
to different purpo&s;es; the event, however, is infinitely to his &s;ervice.
Thomas Harri&s;on [lord Somers] and Mr. Noy [lord Rivers] are both
dangerou&s;ly ill, and their recovery much doubted; but though the&s;e
gentlemen were con&s;iderable in their way, yet I &s;hall be much le&s;s con|cerned
for what becomes of them, than I am for the death of hone&s;t Mr.
Nicho's wife [captain David Floyd]: her di&s;temper was the jaundice, to
which &s;he had been &s;ubject &s;everal years; but it increa&s;ing of late upon
her, &s;he went down to the Bath, where &s;he died the &s;econd of this month,
O. S. and was buried there the 4th. I tell you the&s;e circum&s;tances for
the &s;ake of their young relation with you, who it is fit &s;hould be ac|quainted
with it; but the manner of doing it I leave to your prudence
and good nature. Certain it is, &s;he was a mo&s;t excellent woman; and
applied her&s;elf to every relation, and in every circum&s;tance of life, with
a cheerfulne&s;s and conduct which I know not where to equal among&s;t all
my acquaintance. You will plea&s;e to give my hearty &s;ervice to the
young gentleman, and tell him the re&s;t of his friends are well, though in

that we laid a good foundation to bring home Mr. Jenkins [the King].
If you would but recover the papers I &s;ent, you could ea&s;ily gue&s;s how
matters may go in time. Mr. Jacob's [King of France's] friends pro|mi&s;ed
to let me know, in a little time, whether they fell into their friends
hands in that country. It appears, by their di&s;cour&s;e, they did fall into
their hands. The Whigs in England lo&s;e ground every day; and to re|gain
it, they openly give out, they will make &s;uch another attempt as
the Tories did in 88. Their friends in this country will give them all the

but, on the contrary, that he will be a truer friend to all Edward's [Eng|land]

it can never be thought rea&s;onable or friendly to pre&s;s him to that mar|riage.
For any thing of that nature, that is either done or may &s;eem to
be done by force or intere&s;t, can never have that good effect that is pro|po&s;ed

believe that any that wi&s;h Ple&s;&s;ington truly well, will ever pre&s;s him ei|ther

&s;ee nothing but firmne&s;s, integrity, honour, and &s;incerity in him, they'll
certainly have much le&s;s rea&s;on to tru&s;t him, when they &s;ee him turn
away &s;o &s;lightly, a poor friend that he has been bred up with, for they'll
either think he is very weak or very in&s;incere, and in either of the&s;e
ca&s;es, they'll have rea&s;on not only to di&s;tru&s;t him, more than they do
now, but even to de&s;pi&s;e him. But I hope Young [prince&s;s Anne], and
Baker [Harley], and Price [the parliament] (if they have any good in|tentions

<P><MILESTONE N="1712" UNIT="year"> THE emba&s;&s;y of the earl of Rivers made little impre&s;&s;ion on the
court of Hannover. The Elector &s;ent back a written an&s;wer by
him, and authorized his own mini&s;ter, the baron de Bothmar, who had
come over with the duke of Marlborough, on the 18th of November
1711, to deliver a long memorial to the mini&s;try. It was publi&s;hed in
the Daily Courant of the 5th of December, and gave great &s;atisfaction
to the Whigs, but very great offence to the Tories; and the mini&s;try
charged Bothmar with e&s;pou&s;ing a party, and intermeddling very un&s;ea|&s;onably
in the affairs of Britain. Dr. Swift throws &s;ome light on this
&s;ubject, in his Hi&s;tory of the four la&s;t years of Queen Anne.</P>
<P><Q>"It was the misfortune of his Electoral Highne&s;s," &s;ays their confi|dent
and advocate, "to be very ill &s;erved, by Mon&s;. Bothmar, his envoy
here; who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at all the factious meetings of the di&s;contented party,
and deceived his ma&s;ter, by a fal&s;e repre&s;entation of the kingdom, drawn
from the opinion of tho&s;e, to whom he confined his conver&s;ation. There
was likewi&s;e at the Elector's court a little Frenchman, without merit or
con&s;equence, called Robithan; who, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and encouragement
of the la&s;t mini&s;try, had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into &s;ome degree of that
prince's favour, which he u&s;ed in giving his ma&s;ter the wor&s;t impre&s;&s;ions
he was able of tho&s;e whom the Queen employed in her &s;ervice, in&s;inuat|ing
that the pre&s;ent mini&s;ters were not in the intere&s;t of his Highne&s;s's
family; that their views were towards the Pretender; that they were
making an in&s;ecure and di&s;honourable peace; that the weight of the
nation was again&s;t them; and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to pre&s;erve,
much longer, their credit or power."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="358">
It is certain, the Elector, who had hitherto affected to be a friend to
both &s;ides, or, at lea&s;t, to be attached to neither of the parties which di|vided
the nation, di&s;covered different &s;entiments this year, and might be
con&s;idered as at the head of one of them. The mini&s;try &s;ent over in the
beginning of the year Mr. Thomas Harley, a cou&s;in of the earl of Oxford,
accompanied by Mr. St. John, brother to the &s;ecretary, in order to remove
whatever prejudices might have been infu&s;ed into his Highne&s;s again&s;t
their proceedings, and to per&s;uade him to come into their mea&s;ures. Mr.
Harley &s;taid long in Holland, and did not arrive in Hannover until the
12th of July.</P>
<P>The Queen, in her &s;peech to both hou&s;es on the 6th of June, expre&s;&s;ed
her&s;elf in this manner: <Q REND="inline">"The a&s;&s;uring the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as by

that acknowledged, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; but to have an additional &s;e|curity,
by the removal of that per&s;on out of the dominions of France,
who has pretended to di&s;turb this &s;ettlement."</Q></P>
<P>But neither Mr. Thomas Harley's declarations and remon&s;trances to the
Elector, nor the Queen's a&s;&s;urances to her parliament, nor the profe&s;&s;ions
of attachment contained in the prime mini&s;ter's letters, could reconcile his
Highne&s;s to the mea&s;ures which were pur&s;ued in Britain; or per&s;uade
him, that the mini&s;try were well affected to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his family.
He was particularly alarmed, by a re&s;olution of the commons again&s;t the
Barrier treaty; whereby they declare, that, under pretext of &s;ecuring the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, and a barrier to the States, many articles
had been in&s;erted, in the treaty, de&s;tructive to the commerce of
Great Britain, and di&s;honourable to her Maje&s;ty. When Mr. Hampden
moved, that an addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the Queen, that &s;he would
be plea&s;ed to give particular in&s;tructions to her plenipotentiaries, that,
in the conclu&s;ion of the treaty of peace, the &s;everal powers, in alliance
with her Maje&s;ty, might be guarantees to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the
crown of the&s;e realms, as &s;ettled by act of parliament, in the illu&s;trious
hou&s;e of Hannover, the hou&s;e rejected his motion; and re&s;olved, that
they had &s;uch an entire confidence in the repeated declarations her Ma|je&s;ty
had been plea&s;ed to make, of her concern for a&s;&s;uring to the&s;e
kingdoms the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, that they could

<P>The baron de Bothmar had returned to be the Elector's envoy in Hol|land,
and his plenipotentiary at the treaty now negociating at Utrecht.
The baron de Grote was &s;ent in November to be his envoy extraordinary
in Great Britain. Bothmar, Grote, and Bern&s;dorff, pre&s;ident of the

the public hear of Bothmar's &s;iding with the faction, are fal&s;e like
many others; for I know inpartiality temper is the character of the Elec|tor;
and I mu&s;t do Mon&s;. Bothmar that ju&s;tice, that here I found him
extremely impartial and temporate. I knew upon the fir&s;t bringing
over the general points, he objected the words The Prote&s;tant, had
been better than The Pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment. I told him, that certainly
<PB N="346" REF="361">
the la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion was the &s;ame as the fir&s;t; for the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment
of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was that in the Elector's family. I told him, I believed
they didn't ju&s;t hold to the old beaten words, being they would have
the&s;e preliminaries appear entirely general, in every point, that none
could take it ami&s;s, and that it might not appear as re&s;trained as the for|mer
were; and, therefore, they avoided the &s;ame words. That, if he
had nothing el&s;e to a&s;&s;ure him of the &s;incerity of the intentions of the
mini&s;try in favour of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, though all their lives and
actions have &s;hewn, that is their fir&s;t principle, yet they would not have
cho&s;en the bi&s;hop and me, being they knew both our principles, and
that we had both the honour to be perfectly known to your court, e&s;pe|cially
my&s;elf. Bothmar &s;eemed &s;atisfied with the di&s;cour&s;e and a&s;&s;urances
he had from me, whil&s;t I had the honour of &s;eeing him alone; though,
after the duke of Marlborough came hither, he was &s;o often taken up in
his Grace's company, I had not the &s;ame opportunity of conver&s;ing with
him, which I was &s;orry for, being Mon&s;. Bothmar is one I had always a
perfect e&s;teem for; and &s;hould have been glad of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to have
advanced in my negociations the intere&s;t of your mo&s;t illu&s;trious family."</P>

<P>"I Have no rea&s;on to complain of your &s;ilence, &s;ince you have been
plea&s;ed to make amends, by the long obliging letter, which I have
&s;o much plea&s;ure in reading; although I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed, that
you &s;ay to me, that they have written to you from London, that Mr.
Bothmar has declared for the Whigs. But, as you &s;ay, towards the end
of your letter, that the rumour may be fal&s;e, I &s;hall have no difficulty
to convince you, that it is; and you will &s;ee, by the memorial, which he
has given on the part of the Elector, that neither Whigs nor Tories are
mentioned in that affair. But as the Queen did the honour to my &s;on,
the Elector, to demand, by my lord Rivers, his opinion of the prelimi|naries
of peace, he thought it was his duty to give it, which he would
not have done, if her Maje&s;ty had not commanded him; and it was nei|ther
<PB N="347" REF="362">
by his order nor by the order of Bothmar, that the memorial has
been printed. But it's &s;aid, her Maje&s;ty has not been di&s;&s;atisfied with it.
You &s;ay, likewi&s;e, that you are of no party; yet if that party, who be|headed
the King, my uncle, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;till, as you &s;ay they do, there
could be now nothing laid to their charge. I imagined, however, that
that party was long &s;ince extinct; yet we have clearly &s;een, in the&s;e lat|ter
times, that the parliament have done what they plea&s;ed, in di&s;po&s;ing
of the crown.</P>
<P>The favourable &s;entiments, which you &s;ay they entertained towards me,
have had no effect; therefore, I am obliged to them only for their good
intention; and as I know none of them but you, I al&s;o believe, that it
is to you alone I owe thanks. The good-natured lord Rivers told me,
he clearly perceived I was of the duke of Marlborough's party. I an|&s;wered,
that, if the Queen had made an ape her general, and that he
had gained &s;o many battles and towns, I would be equally for him: and
I &s;ee that you have forgot how little I was obliged to his wife; and as
for him&s;elf, he never &s;poke to me of any thing which had any concern
with the advantages of this hou&s;e. His expre&s;&s;ion, in &s;peaking of the
Queen, was always, that &s;he was a very good fort of a woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were al&s;o his expre&s;&s;ions to the court of St. Germains. Stuart Papers, Nov. 1711.</NOTE> He
repeated this frequently, and it appeared to us too low a commendation

giving me &s;ome agreeable rubbs, that I ought to &s;till this letter rather
<PB N="348" REF="363">
with excu&s;es for my former, than to pre&s;ume again to ju&s;tify any thing

heard the late Queen of Pru&s;&s;ia, your daughter, &s;ay, &s;o I hope your Royal
Highnes will not take it ill, if in an&s;wer to what you are plea&s;ed to
write, I ju&s;tify a little my former arguments, and &s;ay, that I believe it is
not to be doubted, but the &s;ons and grand&s;ons of tho&s;e live, who were
of the party who did that barbarous murder on the King your Royal
uncle, and all tho&s;e are ranged in the party of the pre&s;ent Whigs; and
certainly the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e is now held, and has been &s;ince time held
among them, as was in tho&s;e former unhappy times; therefore, one has
rea&s;on to apprehend from the &s;ame race, and &s;ame principles, the &s;ame
facts; and I believe no true Whig will, in his con&s;cience, where he is put
to it, and has any con&s;cience, &s;ay that he loves monarchy better than de|mocracy.
Now the danger tho&s;e princes run, that make u&s;e of a party,
who&s;e principle and con&s;cience is again&s;t them, is obvious to all the
world: and I yet, I &s;ay again, naturally I am of neither party, but was
for moderation, till I &s;aw it &s;o abu&s;ed, that it only put the government
in danger; then, out of love to my country, and not till then, I put my|&s;elf
and intere&s;t entirely into the other party; not that I am per&s;onally
angry with any one man of the party, but really the bu&s;ine&s;s of party is
&s;o confounded, that even a native of our country can hardly di&s;tingui&s;h
them; and how much le&s;s could Mr. Bothmar, who has not been, in all
his lifetime, in England not above five or &s;ix months at mo&s;t, and there|fore
very, very unfit to meddle in &s;uch nice matters, e&s;pecially he not
&s;peaking the language; and not only to draw him&s;elf into a matter he
could not under&s;tand, but al&s;o the Elector his ma&s;ter, who&s;e apparent
intere&s;t it was not to have meddled to have &s;et any one of either party
again&s;t him. I may almo&s;t venter to &s;ay in confidence to your R. H.
who has always &s;hown a particular indulgence for me, that I knew
from whence the &s;pring of that memorial came, and the violence of
tho&s;e people, I fear, will do great prejudice at your court; and pray be|lieve
me, Madam, the Queen and all her pre&s;ent mini&s;ters are entirely
well di&s;po&s;ed for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in your family, and nothing
can turn that di&s;po&s;ition; no, not even the unkind way of remon&s;trating
and blaming their intentions and proceedings in print, by way of memo|rial:

I do, and the intrigues of England better than the baron de Bothmar, who

the acknowledgment of her Maje&s;ty. I imagine, the&s;e will be the ar|ticles

<P>&mdash;"I Have this comfort, that, in &s;pite of all in&s;inuations to the
contrary, I have begun, by making the French, at the very
fir&s;t conference, declare them&s;elves ready to acknowledge your &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
to the crown of England, and that they will &s;end the Pretender to travel
where we plea&s;e. This we did artificially enough, at the fir&s;t conference,
in &s;pite of all the intrigues were u&s;ed to hinder us from &s;peaking till the
French had been obliged to give their &s;pecifique explications; and this we
did, without that any Whig can pretend the lea&s;t merit in it; though I
believe, they who always &s;trive to attribute all to them&s;elves, will &s;trive
to attribute what has been done at home to their indu&s;try. However it
is, at lea&s;t, they mu&s;t own it was not oppo&s;ed by the Tories.&mdash;I am
glad, in one part of my arguments, your Royal Highne&s;s &s;eemed to
aque&s;&s;e, that you never loved or liked the dutche&s;s of Marlborough's
character; and that you thought the duke's way of &s;peaking of the Queen
was in too &s;lighting a manner. If your Royal Highne&s;s had known and
&s;een as much as the Queen has done, you would think much wor&s;e of
both; really, Madam, a prince is happier that rules the hearts of all his
people, than he who is &s;et up by one, and &s;ets him&s;elf at the head but of
one party. In a limited monarchy, he reigns but over half his people.
The temper and con&s;titution of England is mightily mi&s;taken by &s;ome
people; this the Queen &s;aw, that by reigning by one party, was but
being a &s;lave to the heads of that party; and, therefore, when &s;he fir&s;t
made her change, it was po&s;&s;itively re&s;olved not to &s;tick to parties, but
to tho&s;e who &s;erved her be&s;t. However, the other party's oppo&s;ition and
violence may have made her change her mind for the mere nece&s;&s;ity at
this conjuncture: if your Royal Highne&s;s was but to hear half the &s;tories
I heard, when I was la&s;t in Britain, you would wonder how the Queen's
patience could bear &s;o long what &s;he has borne; &s;uch u&s;age no mi&s;tre&s;s
of a family would have borne from their menial &s;ervants. But I hope
there is an end of it, and that &s;he will &s;pend the re&s;t of her days happily,
<PB N="351" REF="368">
as &s;he really de&s;erves to do for her many good qualities. We are now all
hard at work, and we &s;hall put that article of your Royal Highne&s;s's &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
and obliging France to promi&s;e, that they &s;hall not, neither di|rectly
nor indirectly, a&s;&s;i&s;t the Pretender; that I hope you will have
rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with us. I wi&s;h I knew any thing you de&s;ired
more, in the&s;e negociations; &s;ince really, be&s;ides the honour, nothing
could be more agreeable to me, than to receive your commands and ex|ecute
them."</P>

which they had a great mind &s;hould pa&s;s the hou&s;e of lords, and
was very nigh it, as no doubt your Royal Highne&s;s has heard, being the

&s;o that I was neither obliged to vote again&s;t the court and mini&s;try, nor
again&s;t my late Ma&s;ter's grants, nor again&s;t a good one he has given me.
I thought it a very difficult point, and am glad it is ended as it is. The
whole town was in expectations the Queen would have &s;aid &s;omething to|day
about the peace; but not doing it, the commons were very angry,

there is in that hou&s;e, to have a peace; &s;o much that &s;ome expre&s;&s;ed

if &s;he would lay it before the parliament, they would ea&s;e her; but they

were told by a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, they mu&s;t be ea&s;y, at lea&s;t, till Wed|ne&s;day
&s;e'night, and by that time, the Queen would lay &s;omething before
them, which was hoped would be to their &s;atisfaction. This unea&s;ine&s;s
&s;hows that any peace almo&s;t would be agreeable to the nation, and yet
I am per&s;uaded we &s;hall have a good one, and &s;uch a one that was not

that her laudable de&s;ign of concluding a good peace, may be accompli&s;hed
with advantage to her crown and to her allies; as her Maje&s;ty her&s;elf

May, in the&s;e terms; "for &s;ince it's thought &s;o dangerous to have Philip
on the throne of Spain, there may be means found to remove him." But
it &s;eems they have not been found. I don't know who could be &s;o ma|licious

<P>"IN &s;pite of all the pains taken to blacken the Queen's admini&s;tration
under the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, and to render us all Jacobites, it would
be endle&s;s to tell your Royal Highne&s;s of the intrigues to that end; but
they will all turn to the &s;hame of the contrivers, as will that lately de|tected
on one Azzurini, an Italian, who finding his encouragement &s;o
great, had even forged a letter from the Pretender to me, though I ne|ver
&s;aw the man in my life time, and am &s;ure, never gave the lea&s;t rea&s;on

up with Popi&s;h and arbitrary principles; for I love liberty &s;o much, that
even the employment I have here, is &s;uch a confinement to me, that I am
unea&s;y till it is ended. Your Royal Highne&s;s knows I always told you
I was tied by obligation to neither party, but if to either, it was to that
called the Tory, &s;ince I found &s;ounder principles and hone&s;ter men,
by much, in that, than in the other party. And &s;ince I was la&s;t in Eng|land
and employed in this negociation, I am extremely confirmed in my

am &s;ure, will make it plain to you; in the meantime, I am glad this
&s;tory of Azzurini will be laid clearly before your Royal Highne&s;s, and
all the encouragements that fellow has had to go on to accu&s;e the mo&s;t
faithful of the Queen's mini&s;ters, and your Royal Highne&s;s's humble

much into that fellow's &s;tories, as to have &s;ent his papers to the Elector,
and to have given him money, and promi&s;e of being gentleman of the
chamber to the Elector. Indeed it were to be wi&s;hed Mon&s;ieur Bothmar
had had a better knowledge of the character of the Engli&s;h, before he
had been &s;ent thither, for I doubt he has mi&s;taken them extremely, and
has drawn others into his errors. I can't help telling your Royal High|ne&s;s
a &s;tory I was told, by one that pretends to have been pre&s;ent. When
Mon&s;ieur Bothmar and count Pa&s;&s;ieny [Pa&s;&s;ionei], the Pope's mini&s;ter,
was together at count Sinzendorff's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He means count Zintzendorff.]</NOTE>, Mon&s;ieur Bothmar rallying count

of your ma&s;ter." Count Pa&s;&s;iony [Pa&s;&s;ionei] an&s;wered him, "that he

<P>"I Arrived from Garlow, with Mr. de Bern&s;torff, but an hour before
the departure of the po&s;t, &s;o that I mu&s;t an&s;wer, in great hurry, the
letter with which your Excellency honoured me. It were to be wi&s;hed
you had made the&s;e difficulties while you were here.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="376">
I never told you that I would in&s;ert the names of the regents in the
blanks left in the copy of the in&s;trument; there is not even room for
them. I gave you the names of tho&s;e who were formerly, and who are
now intended to be regents (to which have been added &s;ince, lord Lex|ington,
lord Polwarth, and lord Annandale). There are &s;everal remarks
on the la&s;t, and a cypher concerning the Queen's health.&mdash;Your Excel|lency
mu&s;t avoid to di&s;cover to any one that the&s;e names are known to
you.</P>
<P>I come now to your remarks.</P>
<P>1. While lord Bolingbroke is &s;ecretary of &s;tate, to whom &s;hall your
Excellency addre&s;s your&s;elf? and how can you avoid to pay &s;ome atten|tions
to him?</P>
<P>There will be no occa&s;ion for this, if he is deprived of that po&s;t.</P>
<P>2. The officers which the Electre&s;s is to have in England, are but
very few in number. She her&s;elf in&s;i&s;ts to offer the nomination of them
to Harley.</P>
<P>I added that to your in&s;tructions, contrary to my own opinion. But
you are to under&s;tand it &s;o, only in ca&s;e your Excellency &s;ees no pro&s;pect
of &s;ucceeding in the affair without that offer; for if you can obtain the
pen&s;ion &s;imply, without any limitations or conditions, it will be certainly
&s;o much the better, and the Electre&s;s will be the more obliged to you.</P>
<P>3. The Elector would very much di&s;gu&s;t tho&s;e who want now, by
way of precaution again&s;t a ca&s;e which is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible, to put him
to the trouble of naming regents by &s;eparate in&s;truments.</P>
<P>The act of parliament gives that power only to the neare&s;t heir; there|fore,
the Elector has it not, and the validity of his nomination at this
time might be di&s;puted. It is to be hoped that the Queen and the Elec|tre&s;s
will not die in the &s;ame week.</P>
<P>4. As their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es always a&s;&s;ured the Queen and her
mini&s;ters that none of the family would go to England without her Ma|je&s;ty's
con&s;ent; that will be &s;till the ca&s;e, if a pen&s;ion is granted to the
Electre&s;s, and being under that new obligation to the Queen, they will
be the more di&s;po&s;ed thereby, to do nothing but in concert with her.
Be&s;ides, the more the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, the le&s;s will the
<PB N="360" REF="377">
pre&s;ence of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or be nece&s;&s;ary. Add to this the pa&s;t conduct of
their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es; for each party, in their turn, incited them
to apply for an invitation to go to England, and they always rejected all
the&s;e intrigues, being determined to do nothing in that re&s;pect, unle&s;s the
Queen entreated them to it.</P>
<P>5. It is not probable that the Engli&s;h mini&s;try will &s;tipulate, on pay|ing
our arrears, that the troops will not return again to the Low Coun|tries.
If they &s;hall think of any thing &s;o fooli&s;h, your Excellency will be
&s;o good as to write about it to our ma&s;ter, and to wait for his orders.</P>
<P>6. Mon&s;ieur de Bothmar having given &s;ome poor lords rea&s;on to ex|pect
&s;mall pen&s;ions, our ma&s;ter would never hear of it; therefore, your
Excellency is in the right not to give a pre&s;ent of a crown without orders;
you may demand them when the opportunity offers. If the hou&s;e will
enable you to make donations when you judge proper, or obtain the per|mi&s;&s;ion
of his Electoral Highne&s;s, let them do &s;o. For my &s;hare, I am
a mere cypher when it is nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k a penny; and I cannot at all
meddle in the affair. I am, &amp;c."</P>

with a great deal of plea&s;ure, but I was al&s;o very well plea&s;ed, that

<P><MILESTONE N="1713" UNIT="year"> THOUGH the attachment of the earl of Oxford to the prote&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion had embarra&s;&s;ed the intrigues of the Jacobites, through|out
the year 1712, the mo&s;t fatal &s;troke to their cau&s;e was the death of the
duke of Hamilton. That nobleman was killed unfairly in a duel, in Hyde|park,
on the 15th of November, while he was upon the point of &s;etting
out for France, in the character of amba&s;&s;ador-extraordinary. The &s;ecret
object of his emba&s;&s;y, the Jacobites affirmed, was to obtain the Iri&s;h regi|ments
in the French &s;ervice, to be conveyed with the Pretender, in a clan|de&s;tine
manner, to Scotland. The Queen her&s;elf, eager for the eventual
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of her brother, is &s;aid to have approved of this &s;cheme. Her ob|ject
was to enter into a treaty with the Pretender upon his arrival; by which
&s;he was to permit him to remain, during her own life in Scotland, under
the character of pre&s;umptive heir of the crown. His friends in parliament
were &s;o numerous, that &s;he formed no doubt of being able to repeal the
act of &s;ettlement. The&s;e mea&s;ures were prevented by the duke's death.
But the Jacobites continued their intrigues, in Great Britain, with unabat|ing
diligence, and entertained great hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. The nation owed
the di&s;appointment of their &s;chemes to the timidity of their leaders, and
the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the Pretender him&s;elf, in adhering to the Romi&s;h faith,
contrary to the advice of all his friends. The following papers throw a
new and very important light on the hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent year. The
&s;ecret intrigues of both parties are di&s;tinctly marked and accurately re|lated;
and a chain of facts is continued, in a manner that gives them
authenticity.</P>

without tempori&s;ing, in the &s;ame manner, might be per&s;uaded to it. I
let him &s;ee the ca&s;e was no way the &s;ame; for whatever inclinations King
Charles might have had to the Catholic Religion, he never was received
into the church, till his la&s;t illne&s;s; whereas the King has been educated
from his infancy in the Catholic Religion, and has all his life made open
profe&s;&s;ion of it. He could not but own the difference of the ca&s;e; but
&s;eemed not to believe that King Charles had not been received Catholic
before his re&s;toration, though certainly he was not. However, he repeated
again, that the King &s;hould be no more teazed upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>My lord Newca&s;tle happening to tell me, that he was acquainted with

for his knight's [Sir Thomas Hanmer] having received the letter,

not to return to England, till he &s;aw what turn affairs were like to
take; that he had already taken mea&s;ures for going to the &s;outh of

and that, if that lord did not &s;atisfy him as to &s;ome things, that he would

<P>"I Have received yours of the 25th of November, with great &s;atisfac|tion,
and have an&s;wered it before, and writ to you to the &s;ame effect
of this; but &s;ince you direct me to &s;end again, by the old direction, the
la&s;t not being found good, for fear that may not come to your hands, I
get my friend, who inclo&s;es this to his corre&s;pondent, to take care of it.
Mr. Rogers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plunket.</NOTE> told me he would write, and de&s;ired a new patron<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Cypher.</NOTE>; and
that then he would &s;end what would be very acceptable, on all accounts.
It is certainly in his power to do it effectually, as you will find. What I
earne&s;tly de&s;ired in my la&s;t, was, that you would u&s;e all your intere&s;t to
fix the remittance of Mrs. Rachel Jones's [the Queen's] money, which
will be returned from hence, by our friend [Mr. Arthur] that inclo&s;es
this. There is none &s;o proper: his known honour, and integrity, and
&s;ub&s;tance, is &s;o unque&s;tionable, that I think there cannot be the lea&s;t ob|jection;
but, as the thing is con&s;iderable, one does not know what intere&s;t
may be made. I did beg and do again, that you will be plea&s;ed to move
it heartily. Mrs. Phillips [lady Middleton] can get it determined for
him, with a word's &s;peaking; and as I told you before, Mrs. Harris
[Harley] did de&s;ire it may be &s;o. He &s;poke to Mr. Rogers's friend to
get it done; for he e&s;teems him it is de&s;ired for. He &s;ent for him to him,
and de&s;ired him to remit a con&s;iderable &s;um "for him, that was of the be&s;t
quality, that has been la&s;tly with you" [Secretary St. John], on Mrs. Dian.
Mansfield's [prince&s;s Anne's] account; &s;o that I beg you to get an an&s;wer
from Mrs. Rachel Jones [the Queen], if it be not already done. As I beg|ged
before, you may, if you plea&s;e; &s;end yours to his corre&s;pondent, to
&s;end the &s;hort way, and it will come &s;afe. I cannot change my opinion of
him I have named [Mr. Harley]. On Mr. Jenkins' [the King's] account, he
would engage all; but keeps the balance in his own power, to give a turn
the way he thinks will prove mo&s;t &s;uitable to continue for his own pri|vate
intere&s;t. He makes him&s;elf many enemies, and &s;ecures but few
friends; for tho&s;e that are in Mr. Jenkins' [the King's] intere&s;t, abo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">inate
<PB N="371" REF="388">
the trimming way he takes; and he will not be able to go on
much longer, without giving &s;ome other demon&s;tration than he yet has.
Mr. Tom Smith [lord Mulgrave] is &s;incere, and he will not be led in &s;o
dark a path. When Mr. Medlicote [the parliament] comes, there will
be another &s;torm rai&s;ed again&s;t him. Would Mr. Sandy [Hannover]
come into his mea&s;ures, he would, we all do believe, join entirely with
him; and that is the rea&s;on, tho&s;e that are entirely for Mr. Jenkins [the
King] do &s;o rail and hate him. He depends only upon the widow's
[prince&s;s Anne's] opinion of him, which will fail him, if Mr. Thomas
Smith [lord Mulgrave] and his friends can prevail upon her. Mrs. Phi|lips's
nephew [lord Shrew&s;bury] will not do any thing in favour of Mrs.
Rachel Jones's [the King's] relations. He is a very cautious man, and
hates his principles, though he may wi&s;h otherways well, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e.
He is &s;ent to be out of Mr. Harris's [Harley's] way. He could wi&s;h,
without doubt, to get Mr. Tom [lord Mulgrave] away, on any plau&s;ible
account; but he acts &s;uch a game, that cannot hold long, becau&s;e nei|ther
&s;ide can depend on him. The next term will &s;how a great deal
what we have to tru&s;t to. We have very good council, that will do the
utmo&s;t at that hearing. You &s;hall have a particular account how all
pa&s;&s;es. Mrs. White would beg, that if it were po&s;&s;ible, you would get
your friend, Sam Brown [Sir William Ellis], to &s;end her, by &s;ome of
tho&s;e that have now a privilege to carry what they plea&s;e, twenty ells of
taffeta, &s;uch as they wear for mantuas, in &s;ummer, of a bright blue. It
will take but little room, and it would oblige a friend of hers, if it could
be done. It generally co&s;ts a crown or &s;omething more an ell. Pardon this
trouble, and believe me mo&s;t &s;incerely, Sir, your mo&s;t humble &s;ervant."</P>

<P>"I Had the honour of writing to you, Sir, &s;ome days ago, that his Royal
Highne&s;s had received from Vienna, a &s;afe conduct for the chevalier
de St. George, in the terms he wanted; and as the &s;afe conduct gives
him no de&s;ignation, but what will be comprehended in the pa&s;&s;port of his
Royal Highne&s;s, he &s;ent for Mr. D'Audi&s;&s;ret to inform him of it. He
&s;howed him, at the &s;ame time, the pa&s;&s;port, which he intends to give to
the chevalier de St. George, of which Mr. D'Audi&s;&s;ret has taken a copy,
to &s;end it to his court, and to know from the King's mini&s;ters, if it will
&s;uit in the terms propo&s;ed. The King's an&s;wer will be known, in four or
five days. The&s;e unavoidable delays, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, have hindered his
Royal Highne&s;s from acquainting the chevalier de St. George &s;ooner with
what he hath done, both at Vienna and in Holland, to &s;atisfy him. He
will have the an&s;wer of the States-general, before the end of the month,
and hopes it will be conformed to that of the Emperor. He orders me
to write to you all that has been done in this affair, in order that you may
inform my lord Middleton of it, and that his Royal Highne&s;s may have
the merit of all his diligence with the King. You will find inclo&s;ed a copy
of the pa&s;&s;port, with which his Royal Highne&s;s propo&s;es to furni&s;h him
and which you will be &s;o good as to convey to my lord Middleton, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"I Came here and acquitted my&s;elf of your lord&s;hip's commands near
the duke, in returning him the King's thanks for his kind offices.
He an&s;wered me, that his de&s;ign to oblige the King, would induce him
to do a great deal more, if it lay in his power, and appeared glad that
the expre&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's pa&s;&s;port was to his Maje&s;ty's liking, as he

de&s;igned it. As to the Emperor's &s;afe conduct, it is &s;till the &s;ame with
the copy I had the honour to &s;end your lord&s;hip &s;ome time ago; but the
duke had an explicatory letter, that di&s;pen&s;es him from the hard condi|tions
impo&s;ed upon him by the former, though, in effect, it meant
nothing, that could lay any e&s;&s;ential obligation upon the duke, to be
re&s;pon&s;ible for the King's conduct, &amp;c. it being what they call Stile de
chancellerie, and intended rather as an admonition, than a binding con|dition,
to which his Royal Highne&s;s holds him&s;elf liable.&mdash;In his &s;econd
letter from the Emperor, he has what &s;ecures and &s;atisfies his nicety
upon that point; &s;o that he de&s;igns to &s;end to your lord&s;hip, the Empe|ror's
and his own pa&s;&s;port, as &s;oon as he has his an&s;wer from the court
of France, which is not yet come. His Royal Highne&s;s expects al&s;o,
by the latter end of this month, an an&s;wer from Holland, about the &s;afe
conduct of that &s;tate, and does not &s;ee any difficulty to be made of it."</P>
<P>January 28, 1713. "This day, his Royal Highne&s;s gave me the in|clo&s;ed
copy of the Emperor's la&s;t letter, in order to &s;end it to your lord|&s;hip.
The rea&s;on why he has not &s;ent it &s;ooner was, that he feared your
lord&s;hip might, by the tenour of this letter, apprehend &s;till that it implied
a kind of injunction to his Royal Highne&s;s, to ob&s;erve the King's de|meanour,
&amp;c. But, as it is, in effect, but an exhortation from the Em|peror,
and that the duke is very far from acting any part that might be
di&s;obliging to the King, or that did not become his own character; he
hopes tho&s;e words, of cour&s;e, &s;uch as he looks upon them to be in the
Emperor's letter, will not &s;tartle your C. the main point, I think
is, that his Royal Highne&s;s is well enough &s;atisfied, that, by that letter,
he lies under no obligation to an&s;wer for any of the King's actions.</P>
<P>He has an account from Holland, that his envoy having told the bi|&s;hop
of Bri&s;tol the Emperor's &s;afe conduct was come, the latter was
curious to know, by what name or qualification the Emperor &s;pecified
our King; and having read the copy of that in&s;trument, appeared well
enough plea&s;ed, that he was not at all named in it; but de&s;igned by the
words <HI>exhibitor pre&s;entium.</HI> The prelate told our envoy, that they (mean|ing
the Engli&s;h) were obliged to the duke of Lorraine, for the care he
took to facilitate the execution of one of the articles agreed upon betwixt
them and France. The &s;ame letter gives an account, that the envoy had
<PB N="376" REF="393">
writ to the pen&s;ionary, to know who he ought to addre&s;s him&s;elf to, for
to &s;olicit the State's &s;afe conduct. The duke believes, that that of the
Emperor's will &s;erve for a model and a motive to di&s;patch theirs. He
expects, in a few days, a courier, that may inform him further about it,
which I &s;hall wait for.</P>
<P>The duke pre&s;umes, that the &s;afe conduct from England has been di&s;|patched
a great while ago; his envoy there having writ po&s;itively to
him, above three months ago, that he had been told &s;o by the mini&s;ter.
Your lord&s;hip knows what there is of it, and may perhaps judge it proper
to inform me of it; for if it be not granted yet, and that it may require
the ceremony of being &s;olicited by his Royal Highne&s;s, he is ready to
act in that, according to in&s;tructions, and to do all things el&s;e that may
contribute to his Maje&s;ty's &s;atisfaction and &s;ettlement at Bar."</P>

<P>"I Told him" (Mr. Philips) "that I would fain know, before he
parted, what he thought of my ma&s;ter, and whether he had friends
in England that he could depend upon. He an&s;wered, as to the fir&s;t
que&s;tion, that he was charmed with the character he had, and &s;oe were a
great many peopel in England, but that they were loth to &s;hew them|&s;elves,
or venture any thing, whil&s;t he had &s;o ill advi&s;ers. I a&s;kt who
tho&s;e were; he an&s;wered, that he ment a coun&s;elle that was there, who
made it their bu&s;&s;ine&s;&s;e to give the King ill impre&s;&s;ions of the prote|&s;tants,
and to make them odious to him, though they were the people
from whom he was to expect mo&s;t &s;ervice.&mdash;As I know my lord Mid|dleton
mu&s;t have beene ment as wan of this coun&s;elle, I a&s;kt him what
was thought of him in England, and that I was &s;ure that no body that
knew him, cod looke upon him as a bigot. He an&s;wered, that he was
in very good e&s;teeme, and thoght very capable of bu&s;&s;ine&s;&s;e, but that
&s;ince he changed his religion, they had not &s;oe good an opinion of him.&mdash;After
all this, I told him there cod be nothing more glorious for him,
nor &s;oe advantageous, as to be the means and in&s;trument of bringinge
the knight, his friend, into the King's intere&s;t; and that if he was &s;oe
hone&s;t a man as he often tould me he was, it ought not to be difficult; to
which he an&s;wered, that if there was an hone&s;t man in England he was
wan, which was an&s;wer enuffe, as he &s;ayd, to my que&s;tion; but that he,
<PB N="378" REF="395">
like others, wod be cautious, till they were &s;hure of the peopel about the
King; but that for his own particular, he wod dey to &s;erve the King;
and he made noe my&s;tery, but that tother was in his intere&s;t as much, if
twere not for the afore&s;aid rai&s;ons.</P>
<P>I then a&s;kt him whether the great man Harle, he believed ever
thoght of doing the King any good; he tould me that que&s;tion was very
difficult to be an&s;wered; that when wan examined neerly &s;everal things
that he does, a body might believe he had no good intentions; but that
he was &s;o cuning and clo&s;e a man, that wan &s;hod not de&s;payre of him,
thogh he dos things that &s;eeme very opo&s;ite to our ma&s;ter's intere&s;t;
and that his friend, the knight, knew no more of that particular then
what he told me.&mdash;I tould him that, &s;ince their Queene cod not live for
ever, that my thoghts Mr. Harle wod doe very prudently to &s;trike up
with the King, to have all confirmed upon him, and continued to him
by the King, after the death of their Queene. He an&s;wered, that if the
King were ma&s;ter of his three kingdoms to-morrow, he wod not be able
to doe for Mr. de Harl&eacute; what the Elector of Hannovre has done
alredy."</P>
<P>In the remaining part of the letter, he gives a very improbable ac|count
of Harley's receiving money from the Elector, and a&s;&s;ures lord
Middleton that Sir Thomas Hanmer and Mr. Philips were &s;incerely in

<P>"MR. Harley has a&s;&s;ured the D. of Hannover, by all that is &s;acred,
that he intends his faithful &s;ervice; and &s;howed that what he has
done was to &s;tem a tide, and that had he acted otherwi&s;e, it would have
ruined all; and that, by being in with &s;ome Jacobites, he is come to the

and by his &s;on in-law, he is come to a better intelligence with Hanno|ver;
<PB N="380" REF="397">
and that &s;on was, and is, a great favourite at Hannover. But the
Whigs &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Hannover of the tricki&s;h temper of Harley, that yet
he does not entirely rely on him; but demands, for a proof of what he
prote&s;ts, that he will give him this proof, that he will get all the &s;heriffs
of each county in, that are Low Church, and a motly mini&s;try, and the
King of France to be guarantee for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for him, and his &s;on
and grand-&s;on to do the &s;ame; this, and all other terms which he de|manded,
Harley has promi&s;ed to do all in his power to perform. And,
on his &s;ide, Harley demands that it &s;hall not be in&s;i&s;ted on to have lord
Wharton, nor any of tho&s;e that were in the mini&s;try, who are his per&s;onal
enemies, but &s;uch as are for moderate ways. He would prove, that
that &s;et were again&s;t Hannover, and aimed at doing for them&s;elves; but
he is content to have the late chancellor Cowper, and &s;ome of that &s;tamp
in, and this is to reconcile him to the body of the Whigs, and promi&s;es
all a&s;&s;urances to him and his. This is now upon the anvil, and you may
a&s;&s;ure my lord Middleton of it, for I was told it by Mr. Cowper (brother
to the late lord chancellor Cowper) as the greate&s;t &s;ecret, and I am &s;ure
it is mo&s;t true; his brother told it to him."</P>
<P>The la&s;t two pages of this letter are decyphered in the original.</P>
<P>"The per&s;on I have named is a very cunning fal&s;e man, and has
&s;everal of Mr. Jenkins's [the King's] friends frequently with him, only to
draw all he can, to do him the more e&s;&s;ential wrong. My council hates
him [Harley], and u&s;es to repeat all his unfair practices; yet, at this
time, owns that he has &s;o warded again&s;t a &s;torm, that few be&s;ides him|&s;elf
could have done; and added, that it was the opinion of all of his &s;ort,
that if he gave the proofs which he had promi&s;ed, and orders it &s;o, to
have the family of Medlecot [parliament] to be &s;uch as they had been
&s;ome years pa&s;t, he will be in e&s;teem with tho&s;e that now hate him.
Here is no public news. We that are called Whigs, are in great hopes
things will go better; for all that can be done yet, to procure a parlia|ment
of Low Church Men, is done: the &s;heriffs of each county, where
there are any of that &s;ort of men pricked, they are cho&s;en, though the
counties are as aver&s;e as ever, or more; and it is &s;aid, there will be ad|mitted
into the council &s;everal of the &s;ame &s;ort. The French amba&s;&s;ador
has inraged the people in bringing over &s;o va&s;t a quantity of wine, and
&s;uffering his &s;ervants to &s;ell it, from his own hou&s;e, by retail, at &s;ix and

what can they do? If they con&s;ent to contradict Mr. Harris's [Harley's]
mea&s;ures, they will have their cong&eacute;e given them, and turned away,
and now there is a way in the family to give their opinion, that the
choice before them is writ to make it &s;tand &s;o, though it be quite wrong;
that advantage they can have by tho&s;e that &s;end up to them, it has been

<P>HE writes to the earl of Middleton, that the duke of Lorrain had
received the an&s;wer of the French court, and that that court ap|proved
of the terms of the Emperor's &s;afe conduct, and of the duke's
pa&s;&s;port. That the duke expected &s;oon the &s;afe conduct of the Dutch,
and did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to have one from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia,
&s;ince he mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be comprehended in the Emperor's, as
Elector of Brandenburgh, like the other princes of the empire.</P>

<P>"I Find by yours of the fir&s;t, that you look upon Pratler's la&s;t letter
rather as a certificate, than a &s;ecurity for you; but I flatter my&s;elf

him no more about it; and I believe it &s;o much, that I have already
made my compliments of congratulation to the King upon it, and de|&s;ired
him to make them to you from me, not being able the&s;e two po&s;ts
to write to you, after having writ very long letters to him&s;elf. I am
&s;ure you cannot doubt of the &s;incerity of my compliments on this occa|&s;ion,
in which the King and I are, at lea&s;t, as much concerned as your|&s;elf;
and I do a&s;&s;ure you, that had I thought your going from the King
for his &s;ervice, I would have told you &s;o, and advi&s;ed him to let you go:
but, as I think quite the contrary, I was bound to &s;ay it, as I did from
the fir&s;t moment I heard of this &s;trange propo&s;al, and as I &s;hall continue
to do, till I &s;ee cau&s;e to change my mind, which, if ever I do, (though
very unlikely) you &s;hall be the fir&s;t man that &s;hall know it. But as to
the trouble&s;ome hero of this di&s;agreeable &s;cene, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of
him here; having already &s;aid all I know or think of him to the King,
whom I find is now very &s;en&s;ible how much he was mi&s;taken in his man.
For lord Edward, I never heard a word of him, but good, till I &s;aw the

good an opinion of him, and I am fully per&s;uaded he de&s;erves it, as I am

<P>"I Communicated your letters of the 20th of January to Sir Jo&s;eph
[the King], in an&s;wer to which he has ordered me to tell you, that
he is very &s;en&s;ible of Cowly's [church of England] friend&s;hip, and truly
concerned for the right &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of that worthy family; that the power
he &s;ent &s;ome years ago, by Mr. Lamb, to con&s;titute new over&s;eers
[bi&s;hops], where they were thought nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts &s;till, and impowers
Cowly's relations [the High Church party] to act according to the tenor
thereof, as occa&s;ion offers, without need of renewing the &s;ame; but,
&s;ince they are now de&s;irous of knowing Sir Jo&s;eph's opinion, and to re|ceive
his further directions, before they proceed to the choice of any new
over&s;eer, you are de&s;ired, in the fir&s;t place, to thank them for the regard
and deference they have to Sir Jo&s;eph in this matter; and in the next
<PB N="383" REF="400">
place, to let them know that he is of opinion this is no proper time,
either for him&s;elf or Cowly, to be making any new &s;teps of that nature.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e he is advi&s;ed, by his be&s;t friends and wi&s;e&s;t lawyers,
to make as few plain acts belonging to his character as po&s;&s;ible, in his
pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e of the difficulty of &s;ecrecy in performing the thing,
and the bad con&s;equences the knowledge thereof might produce in this
juncture of time.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e the over&s;eers of Cowley's family, who are now in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, being by far the greater number, ought not, in prudence, to
be provoked at this time.</P>
<P>For the&s;e, and other rea&s;ons, Sir Jo&s;eph thinks it will be much better,
both for his own &s;ervice, and for the good of Cowley's family, to &s;it
quiet at pre&s;ent, and defer till a better opportunity, e&s;pecially &s;ince the
thing has been delayed &s;o long already. This you will be plea&s;ed to im|part

and e&s;teem for them.</P>
<P>You are al&s;o de&s;ired to tell them to recommend to all their friends to
a&s;&s;ociate with Hickman [Harley] and company [the mini&s;try], and go
along with them in all their mea&s;ures, according to the directions given
la&s;t year to Morley; and particularly to caution his relations in Proby's

company, unle&s;s it be in conjunction with How [prince&s;s Anne] and his

of them; therefore, take care of what papers you have in his hands, and
if Kennedy [King of France] will not undertake our bu&s;ine&s;s, have you
any more proper than Stanhope [Scotland], who would be hearty for his
own &s;ake, to get rid of Mr. Underhill [the Union], whom he hates
mortally, and believes he will be his ruin; and if Kirkton [the King]
were &s;ent to him before Harri&s;on [Hannover] comes, it would di&s;tract
Mr. Eden [England] too, and make him jealous even of his brother
Edgar [the Engli&s;h], which he is not a little already. It is a race, and
who comes fir&s;t wins. I writ to you, about the beginning of la&s;t &s;um|mer,
that Mr. Arnold &s;aid it was not the way of merchants to pay bills

which makes me think, you have &s;ome better way, perhaps, now by
Freeman [France]. However, pray let me know I am di&s;charged of the
matter, that no blame may be on me; for, till you tell me &s;o, I &s;hall

<HEAD TYPE="sub">This extract is in Sir William Ellis's hand, and was probably &s;ent by

<ARGUMENT>
<P>About the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown after the death of Queen Anne, and the in|trigues
for &s;ecuring it for her brother.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"THAT what he had &s;aid, in a former letter, viz. That Mr. Harley
and his brethren would call home the King; he had it from, and
has &s;ince had it confirmed to him by, Mr. Netterville; which is, he &s;ays,
as much as if he had had it from Mr. Harley's own mouth: and that he
has had the &s;ame thing confirmed to him, at &s;everal times, by Mr. Pen,
the Quaker.</P>
<P>That lord Mulgrave, and the re&s;t of his opinion, would be glad to
have the King home as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, if they knew how to do it with|out
running any hazard; and that prince&s;s Anne is of the &s;ame mind,
but timorous. This, he &s;ays, comes from lady Fretchwel.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons he gives for not making u&s;e of a cypher formerly &s;ent to
Mr. Netterville, in order to his corre&s;ponding with my lord Middleton,
are, that the French mini&s;ters had given him a di&s;advantageous character
of my lord Middleton. That his lord&s;hip and lord Melfort do not agree,
and betray one another. That Mr. Netterville was de&s;ired from thence,
(that is, from St. Germains, or from Paris) not to corre&s;pond with any
there, for he would have been betrayed. But that Mr. Netterville tells
<PB N="388" REF="405">
him, that my lord Middleton and Sir William Ellis are hone&s;t, mode|rate,
and under&s;tand the affairs of England the be&s;t of any he knows,
con&s;equently the fitte&s;t to be entru&s;ted and employed. He gives ano|ther
rea&s;on, for not u&s;ing the cypher &s;ent to Netterville, viz. Le&s;t Mr.
Harley &s;hould know he corre&s;ponds with any about the King, and gives
mea&s;ures different from Mr. Harley's, and &s;uch as may hinder the King
from coming to the terms, which he &s;ays, perhaps, may be expected from
his Maje&s;ty; that Mr. Harley would have the King kept in the dark,
believe nothing but what comes from him, or think of a re&s;toration but
by his means; and that the King mu&s;t abandon Rome, if he de&s;ires to
come home. Mr. Netterville a&s;ked him, why he did not &s;end &s;ome body
to the King, to know his mind; he replied, the King of France would
know it and would rai&s;e di&s;turbances in England, which he (Harley)
would prevent all he can; which, Mr. Rogers &s;ays, he believes, he will
do, as long as prince&s;s Anne lives; and advi&s;es not to believe the con|trary,
or rely on a civil war, as Me&s;&s;rs. Harley and Netterville &s;ay, they
are &s;ure, we are made believe, by Sheridan, Mrs. Fox, Mr. Minnis, Mr.
Fergu&s;on, and the&s;e, Mr. Rogers &s;ays, he calls Propaganda &s;tories.
The&s;e, he de&s;ires, may not be believed, becau&s;e the writers are &s;trangers
to the affairs on the anvil.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, he is &s;urprized that Sir William Ellis had not the papers he
&s;ent him from Rotterdam; and &s;ays, he directed one of them to Sir
Richard Cantillon.</P>
<P>That D. Hamilton propo&s;ed to obtain of the King of France four
or five regiments to have gone with the King to Scotland; and then prin|ce&s;s
Anne and the parliament would have ventured to treat with his Ma|je&s;ty,
which they won't hazard to do otherwi&s;e till after the peace, and
till they have turned out all the Low Church men; which being done,
will &s;end to treat with his Maje&s;ty,, and with the King of France, who
mu&s;t give as a &s;ecurity for the King's performance.</P>
<P>That Mr. Harley manages the Low Church and Hannover, till he
can get the peace &s;ettled. Believes him hearty to the King's intere&s;t, and
has &s;everal in&s;tances of it, though few of the Jacobites believe him to
be &s;o.</P>
<P>The cabinet-council are for the King, for their own intere&s;t and fear;
but will hazard nothing. That Mr. Harley has &s;o watchful an eye over
<PB N="389" REF="406">
him (Rogers), that he can't go to lord Mulgrave nor B&mdash;; but
lord Yarmouth goes between them. That Mr. Netterville knows every
thing, and Mr. Harley con&s;ults him in every thing; and yet he (mean|ing,
as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, Netterville) would have the King re&s;tored at any
rate.</P>
<P>That they (Mr. Rogers and Mr. Netterville) would fain make duke
D'Aumont &s;ub&s;ervient to the King's intere&s;t; but Rogers thinks he and
tho&s;e about him, are more capable of &s;poiling than doing bu&s;ine&s;s, for he
(duke D'Aumont) thinks he knows more than he does, won't be advi&s;ed,
and pretends to know England, of which he knows nothing at all; but
however, thinks he may be made &s;ome u&s;e of, &s;uch as to fetch and carry.
He de&s;ires this may be read to none, but to the King.</P>
<P>That the cabinet-council intend to purge the army and the guards,
and make a thorough regulation in the kingdom. That he (Rogers)
will give a full account of all circum&s;tances, when he comes. That he
is told, he &s;hall, after a little time, be &s;ent to Bar, to let the King know
his true friends in Scotland and England; but whether he is &s;ent or no,
he will endeavour to come, becau&s;e it will be of u&s;e to his Maje&s;ty's af|fairs;
though he knows Mon&s;. Torcy and Mr. Harley do not de&s;ire he
&s;hould go at pre&s;ent; but he &s;ays, he will find a good colour, when there
is occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>That a great many of the Whigs have &s;ub&s;cribed a paper, and &s;ent it
to prince&s;s Sophia, &s;etting forth their own &s;trength, and advi&s;ing that
young Hannover may be &s;ent to England, whither he may lawfully come
(being naturalized a peer). That he (Rogers) could have got &s;aid paper
&s;ecured; but thought it be&s;t to let it be &s;ent, in order to let Hannover
further expo&s;e him&s;elf, to no purpo&s;e, which will turn to the King's ad|vantage.
By way of po&s;t&s;cript to this letter, which is of the 14/25 February,
he &s;ays, he had ju&s;t then had a letter from Holland, advi&s;ing, that lord
Churchill and his friends are taking mea&s;ures to &s;end over young Han|nover;
as being the only re&s;ort he and his party have. But Mr. Rogers
thinks, as before, the &s;ooner he attempts it the better. In his letters of the
20 February,/3, March, he gives an account of the mea&s;ures lord Churchill and the
Dutch are taking, and particulars of the paper which the Whigs &s;ub|&s;cribed
and &s;ent to the prince&s;s Sophia; viz.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="407">
That prince&s;s Anne could not live longer than March.</P>
<P>That &s;he (prince&s;s Sophia) &s;hould order matters &s;o, as to be ready to
come at twenty-four hours warning.</P>
<P>That they will get the heads of the clergy to give prince&s;s Anne a
memorial; &s;etting forth, that the King is coming to England, and bring|ing
with him the Roman Catholic religion. This they believe will make
the country declare for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Hannover, and give a handle
to the parliament to &s;end for prince&s;s Sophia and her grand&s;on, as the
only pledges &s;he (prince&s;s Anne) and the kingdom can have, at pre&s;ent,
for the &s;ecurity of the prote&s;tant religion, in and out of England, for the
future.</P>
<P>That they will urge, in their &s;aid memorial to have the Whigs &s;hare
equally with the Tories in the government.</P>
<P>That they will get the D. of Hannover's mini&s;ter in England to &s;econd
this memorial, which Mr. Rogers &s;ays, he hopes he (Hannover's mini|&s;ter)
will do; but believes the cabinet-council will prevent the giving of
any &s;uch memorial. That Mr. Harley laughed at it, but looks on it to
be well concerted.</P>
<P>That Somers, Halifax, and C&mdash;r, are pre&s;&s;ing Netterville daily, to
u&s;e his intere&s;t with Mr. Harley, to bring them and their friends into
bu&s;ine&s;s; that the per&s;on who manages this affair with Netterville is his
(Mr. Rogers's) acquaintance; and tells him al&s;o, that Cowper, the late
chancellor, if he could get off hand&s;omely from the Whigs, would join
with prince&s;s Anne in all her mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>That he (Rogers) knows, Mr. Harley is for dividing the employments
betwixt the High and Low Church, and for having the choo&s;ing of them
him&s;elf; hoping, by that means, to be ma&s;ter, whoever gets the crown.
But that the October-club will never &s;uffer this, and Mr. Harley &s;tands
in awe of that club, which is jealous of him already; and if he &s;hould
&s;hare the places, as afore&s;aid, he would &s;oon be di&s;carded.</P>
<P>That Mr. Harley has &s;pies among the Whigs, that di&s;cover all their
de&s;igns; and he lets them play with their plot, till he &s;ees his time to
break it, and then they begin another. This, Mr. Rogers &s;ays, he knows
to be true, as having been employed in the&s;e matters from the beginning.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="408">
That, if the papers he (Rogers) has given to the cabinet-council were
publi&s;hed, he doubts not, they would reconcile all the kingdom to the
King's intere&s;t; but that Mr. Harley, believing this would le&s;&s;en his
credit with the King, and give his Maje&s;ty occa&s;ion to think, what &s;er|vice
he (Harley) might do was more out of nece&s;&s;ity than duty and affec|tion,
has oppo&s;ed and prevailed with prince&s;s Anne to oppo&s;e the pub|li&s;hing
of &s;aid papers, which lord Mulgrave and his Maje&s;ty's true
friends were for having done. That there are two parliament-men who
would fain have him (Rogers) give them &s;ome of tho&s;e papers: that they
would improve them to advantage. But he &s;ays, he thinks it too nice
a thing to venture upon, without advice: &s;o de&s;ires Sir William Ellis's
opinion, by the next ordinary, and believes the October-club would
make a good bu&s;ine&s;s of it.</P>
<P>That there is an old acquaintance of his (Rogers) there (at London),
who &s;ends intelligence to prince&s;s Sophia of what the Whigs are doing.
That the &s;aid per&s;on &s;hows him (Rogers) all &s;he &s;ends. That &s;he is a
great confident of prince&s;s Sophia's; and, by this means, he (Rogers)
&s;hall have a further occa&s;ion, he &s;ays, of &s;erving the King.</P>
<P>That we, he &s;ays (meaning, as &s;eems, him&s;elf and the King's friends
there) mu&s;t &s;train a point to get the King &s;oon re&s;tored; for lord Mul|grave
is old, and lord Shrew&s;bury is right, but timorous. The&s;e two,
he &s;uppo&s;es, govern the cabinet-council, and keep Mr. Harley in awe;
and that, if Mulgrave dies, Mr. Harley will &s;end lord Shrew&s;bury to
Ireland, and then govern the cabinet-council to give the crown to whom
he plea&s;es, and that this makes him (Harley) delay, and go &s;o &s;low in re|forming
the government.</P>
<P>That, to prevent Mr. Harley's management as aforefaid, he (Rogers)
had thought fit to acquaint lord Mulgrave with &s;ome late advices he had
had from Holland, viz. That Hein&s;ius is of opinion, Holland can't be
&s;afe whil&s;t the government of England is in the hands of the Tories;
and that it &s;hould be the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Dutch and Whigs, whether
there be war or peace, to blow up the Tories, or at least make them un|ea&s;y.
That, &s;ince this advice has been communicated as afore&s;aid, he
(Rogers) finds Mr. Harley is unea&s;y and is afraid that the cabinet-council
will join with the Whigs, this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, to &s;end him to the
Tower; and to obviate it, he is for making five or &s;ix peers more, and
<PB N="392" REF="409">
to publi&s;h the peace, at lea&s;t with France and Spain, which he thinks
will &s;o far plea&s;e the two hou&s;es, in regard of the advantages England
has by it, that they will be &s;oon reconciled to him.</P>
<P>That, on 23 Feb./3 March, a man of note had advice from Ireland, that the
Whigs there are ready to declare for Hannover, and that the We&s;t of
Scotland will join with them. That Netterville acquainted Mr. Harley
with this, and advi&s;ed him to proceed forthwith to a thorough reforma|tion,
in the three kingdoms; that, otherwi&s;e, prince&s;s Anne could not
be &s;afe. That Mr. Harley an&s;wered, No danger. That the parliament
will be &s;o well plea&s;ed with his conduct and management, that the Whigs
and their adherents will be &s;oon laid on their backs. That all the coun|try
gentlemen are for prince&s;s Anne and her mini&s;ters, and will not be
for Hannover. That the Whigs may make a noi&s;e this &s;e&s;&s;ion, and in|vite
Hannover to come to no&s;e prince&s;s Anne; yet all will not do, and
they will get no point by it; for the parliament will declare neither way.
Their bu&s;ine&s;s will be to &s;ecure the prote&s;tant religion, and order matters
&s;o now, that it will not be in the King's power ever to hurt it. Mr.
Rogers adds, that, by this means, he (Harley) will weather the point.
And that you, he &s;ays, "may depend upon it, if there is truth in man,
and I, he &s;ays, under&s;tand any thing, the way is a paving for the King;
but as they are re&s;olved to run no ri&s;que for a re&s;toration, they'll take
their own time, and the &s;afe&s;t way to do it; and the King of France is
in the &s;ecret;" and you will find all this to be true in the end.</P>
<P>I, he &s;ays, don't think the King &s;afe at Barleduc, and that the allies
will &s;tand at nothing to ruin him.</P>
<P>That he (Rogers) had, &s;ince his la&s;t, which was of the 23 February,/6 March,
introduced Netterville to D. D'Aumont, who di&s;cour&s;ed with them two
hours and a half. That they &s;howed him how ea&s;y it would be, for his
ma&s;ter and him, to procure the King's re&s;toration, if they would follow
the mea&s;ures that &s;hould be given them. That the &s;aid duke an&s;wered,
"their de&s;ire &s;hould be &s;trictly complied with;" and that the King or
none of his hou&s;e &s;hould know any thing, till the bu&s;ine&s;s is done. He
(the duke) told them, he would rely on what intelligence they will give
him, and will give what money is nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on his ma&s;ter's
bu&s;ine&s;s, which they had &s;howed him was to re&s;tore the King; with re|gard
<PB N="393" REF="410">
to his own &s;afety and welfare, of which he &s;eemed to be &s;en&s;ible,
de&s;ired their friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;aid they &s;hould find their
account in it.</P>
<P>'Tis believed lord Nottingham will, at the meeting of the parliament,
in&s;i&s;t on Hannover's being &s;ent for.</P>
<P>That there is come for England one Widam of Camb, as he pretends
him&s;elf, from the King of France. That he told Mr. Netterville, that
the King is not much concerned for the crown; is nothing at all addicted
to the Roman Catholic religion; is in the hands of lord Middleton and
Sir William Ellis, both dei&s;ts, and believes they'll make him one, and are
not at all liked or looked on in the court of France; and that lord Melfort
is the man he (Mr. Netterville) &s;hould corre&s;pond withal. This, and much
more &s;uch ful&s;ome &s;tuff, it is &s;aid Widam told Netterville, in order to
his acquainting Mr. Harley with it; but Mr. Netterville would not, know|ing
it would do the King harm; and, if &s;aid man &s;tays long, he will do
hurt. What is or has been doing for the King's intere&s;t hitherto may be
&s;poiled, by &s;uch fooli&s;h management. The man means well; but Mr.
Netterville is not plea&s;ed with his actings, nor any that hears him.</P>
<P>Mr. Netterville propo&s;ed lately to Mr. Harley, to have a bill brought
in to break the triennial act, and to have the army put into tru&s;ty hands.
Mr. Harley an&s;wered, the breaking the triennial act would &s;eem too vio|lent,
and there's rea&s;on to hope the next parliament will be as good as
this. The kingdom will be &s;o well plea&s;ed with the peace, that the pre|&s;ent
mini&s;ters will be better &s;ettled than hitherto, and the late mini&s;ters
more bla&s;ted this &s;e&s;&s;ion than they were the la&s;t. That the country gen|tlemen
will never be reconciled to the Whigs.</P>
<P>Mr. Rogers &s;ays, that mo&s;t of the country gentlemen are for having
the King; but will hazard nothing.</P>
<P>That he finds, after a little while, the duke of Berwick may have a
pa&s;&s;port to come for England; that he and lord Middleton and Sir Wil|liam
Ellis are not hated, but lord Melfort is. Mr. Netterville tells Mr.
Harley they are men of moderation, which is well looked on among
them in England.</P>
<P>That it's de&s;ired, the King of France, or any of his, may not know,
that Mr. Rogers writes to Sir William Ellis, and what he writes, he de|&s;ires
<PB N="394" REF="411">
the King only may know it; <MILESTONE N="March." UNIT="month"> and that Mr. Netterville tells him
they mu&s;t &s;erve the King unknown to the King of France and tho&s;e
about him; and that the King of France mu&s;t make u&s;e of no other mea|&s;ures,
but what they in England give him."</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>March 9th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"YOUR friend Mr. Ple&s;&s;ington [the King] read your letter to me of
the 20th ult. with a great deal of &s;atisfaction, finding you per&s;i&s;t
&s;till in your former opinion, that it is Baker's [Harley's] real intere&s;t, and
con&s;equently his inclination, to have Harper's [Hannover's] decree re|ver&s;ed.
It's certain, that if Aylmer [the prince&s;s Anne] &s;hould break
[die] before the cau&s;e be reheard, that Baker [Harley] is in as much dan|ger
of &s;uffering in proportion as Manly [the King]; and, therefore, it is
rea&s;onable to hope he &s;hould u&s;e all his endeavours to bring this matter
to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible he can, &s;ince delays are equally dan|gerous
for both.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the late alarm he has had of Aylmer [the prince&s;s Anne] break|ing
may quicken him a little for what was like to happen, when even
Berry him&s;elf, in &s;ome of his la&s;t letters, had no apprehen&s;ion of Ayl|mer's
[the prince&s;s Anne's] affairs being in any real danger, may happen
hereafter in effect, when lea&s;t feared or expected; and, in &s;uch a ca&s;e,
no wi&s;e merchant, who has his all at &s;take, ought to lo&s;e a moment, to
en&s;ure his effects and make him&s;elf and his partners ea&s;y.</P>
<P>I reckon Baker [Harley] is &s;ure of Philips [the peace] by this time;
and Young [prince&s;s Anne] and he may reckon upon Kemp's [King's]
friend&s;hip. Wanly [the Whigs] is low, at pre&s;ent, and they have it in
their power to make him [them] yet lower. Wheatly [the Engli&s;h] has
but one objection again&s;t Manly [the King], which Arnot and all Cary's
true relations [the church of England] know to be unrea&s;onable, &s;ince
all the rea&s;onable &s;ecurity Cary him&s;elf can de&s;ire to remove all fears
of danger from Cotton's partner&s;hip [the Roman Catholic religion],
Manly [the King] is willing to grant.</P>
<P>This old dying man Price [the parliament] is tractable. Baker [Har|ley]
has an a&s;cendant over him, and he cannot be &s;ure of having the
&s;ame credit with his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, nor that Young [prince&s;s Anne] him&s;elf
<PB N="395" REF="412">
will be then in being, and in a condition to &s;upport him. Edward's
[England's] be&s;t relations &s;peak well of Manly [the King], at pre&s;ent;
and the generality of Wheatly's family [the Engli&s;h] are di&s;&s;atisfied with
Harper's [Hannover's] late behaviour; but the&s;e gentlemen being change|able,
their hearts may cool. All this con&s;idered, I confe&s;s, I cannot &s;ee
any prudent rea&s;on for Baker's [Harley's] dilatory proceedings: but he
being the chiefe&s;t lawyer, and his own intere&s;t &s;o much concerned, Man|ly
[the King] mu&s;t be governed by him, and comply with what he can|not
help; and, in the mean time, have patience and hope the be&s;t."</P>
<P>There follows here a paragraph, in which names occur for which there
is no key, in the whole corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>"Ple&s;&s;ington [the King] is, God be thanked, in very good health, and
receives all the friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s from the Gentleman [duke of
Lorraine], in who&s;e hou&s;e he lodges at pre&s;ent; but he hopes Aitkins
will invite him to a better hou&s;e before it be long."</P>

for rea&s;ons which your good &s;en&s;e will &s;upply you with; and, there|fore,
I need mention none. What I hope and wi&s;h is, that he may bring

<P>"I Received, la&s;t po&s;t, the favour of two of yours together, of the 3d
and 10th March, which I had the honour to read, both to Mr.
Kennedy [the King] and Mr. Crofton [lord Middleton]. The fir&s;t is
very &s;en&s;ible of your care of his and of Wi&s;ely's [the Queen's] concerns;
and the latter gives you his kind &s;ervice, and is very glad you received
his letter. I am glad to find you &s;till &s;o hearty in the hopes you have of
the recovery of the mortgage; but I find you have no hopes that old
Price [the parliament] will move any thing in the matter, &s;o we mu&s;t

expect he will; and that no breaking<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Queen's death.</NOTE> happens between this and the hear|ing
of the decree.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that common intere&s;t is the be&s;t &s;ecurity between
merchants, and therefore your argument is good; but intere&s;t, as well
as inclinations, change with time and other accidents. Be&s;ides that, many
of the wi&s;e&s;t men mi&s;take their true intere&s;t every day; but, however,
we mu&s;t be contented, in the&s;e uncertain times, with what certainty we
can have; and &s;o Young [prince&s;s Anne] keep up his credit, I hope as
you do, that, &s;oon or late, all will go well.</P>
<P>But I am &s;orry you find Cary [church of England] &s;o animated again&s;t
poor Cotton [Roman Catholic religion], who de&s;ires only to live in peace
and quiet at home, and to give &s;ecurity that he never will meddle with
or di&s;turb Cary in the lea&s;t. I hope, when Cary, who is a rea&s;onable, ju&s;t
man, is truly convinced that this is both Manly's [the King's] and Cot|ton's
[Catholics'] character, and their &s;incere intention, he will not be &s;o
<PB N="398" REF="415">
irreconcileable as he appears to be now that they are at a di&s;tance. As
for Waters, I do not wonder at his ill-nature; for he is naturally hot-headed,
and very much piqued at this time: but I hope coun&s;ellor Baker
[Harley], with the help of Mr. Philips [the peace], will bring him to
temper. I do a&s;&s;ure you, Mr. Peacock's relations [the Prote&s;tants] re|ceive
all marks of friendship and e&s;teem from Ple&s;&s;ington [the King], that
he can &s;hew them, in the limited &s;tate he is in, and will continue to do
&s;o, not only becau&s;e it is his inclination, as well as his intere&s;t, but be|cau&s;e
he is naturally ju&s;t and impartial to all his de&s;erving friends, with|out
di&s;tinction of families.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he loves old Edwards [England] &s;o well, that he'll do any
thing to plea&s;e him, that an hone&s;t man can do; and I am glad to find
Arnot gives it as the general opinion, both of friends and enemies, upon
Change, that his parting with his old friends, and e&s;pecially at this time,
would le&s;&s;en his character, and lo&s;e his reputation and credit with all
&s;ides. He is certainly too hone&s;t a man to di&s;&s;emble or deceive any body,
and too wi&s;e, on the other hand, not to comply with any thing that is in|nocent
in it&s;elf, in order to plea&s;e and oblige his old uncle Edwards."</P>

the intere&s;t of your old friend Mr. Kennedy [the King]; who, I
a&s;&s;ure you, is very &s;en&s;ible of it, and takes it very kindly; but, as for
A. B. [Abb&eacute; Butler], who pretends to know much of his mind, he to|tally
di&s;owns him and what he gives out, and a&s;&s;ures me he neither has, nor
ever had, any dealing with him, directly or indirectly; and was &s;o far from
giving him any commi&s;&s;ions and in&s;tructions, that neither he nor his part|ner
Quarington &s;o much as &s;poke to him, or &s;aw him, when he parted;
and that what he, the &s;aid A. B. [Abb&eacute; Butler], gives out to be Mr.
Kennedy's [the King's] intentions, is the farthe&s;t from his thoughts of
any thing in the world, and which would be the la&s;t thing in the world
he would do. The judgment you &s;ay Mr. Netterville made of it, viz.
that it would do hurt, if not true, was very ju&s;t, and certainly it would

do &s;o; and, therefore, &s;ince it is not true, nor ever likely to be &s;o, it

is much plea&s;ed with it, and wi&s;hes they may act in concert with Mr.

<P>"YE&s;terday, dear Sir, the Queen made a &s;peech to both hou&s;es. The
hou&s;e of commons unanimou&s;ly, except my lord William Pawlet,
voted an addre&s;s of thanks. The hou&s;e of lords carried it by 78 again&s;t
43. The duke of Beaufort was the fir&s;t that moved to thank her Ma|je&s;ty:
he was &s;econded by the duke of Kent. My lord Halifax &s;tood up
and &s;aid, it was fit to know for what; for they ought to have had the
peace laid affore them fir&s;t, and how the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is &s;ecured by the peace;
for the Pretender is but a day's journey further off; is &s;till within call:
that the Queen, when &s;he was la&s;t in the hou&s;e, &s;aid, &s;he would make
peace &s;word in hand. Upon which there was &s;ix millions given; and,
&s;oon after, the &s;word was taken out of a &s;ucce&s;sful general's hand, and
a peace made when they might conquer France. He was &s;econded by
my lords Town&s;end, Cowper, Sunderland, Montague, who all &s;poke
with a deal of warmth and peevi&s;hne&s;s; which is flying in the face of the
Queen and mini&s;try, and que&s;tioning her &s;incerity, and not believing what
&s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>My lord Peterborough &s;tood up and an&s;wered, &s;econded by my lord
[trea&s;urer, probably,] and a great many more of the tory lords, that it
<PB N="402" REF="419">
was time the &s;word was taken out of the general's hands, or el&s;e he would
have been general for life, and continued the war, and the nation been
obliged to give many millions: that Hannover had three acts of parlia|ment
for him and the guarantee abroad, and more laws might be made
to &s;ecure it more, if they think fit; and if they be not &s;atisfied with the
management of the mini&s;try, they might appoint a committee to examine
matters, and due &s;atisfaction &s;hould be given them. This my lord trea|&s;urer
&s;aid.</P>
<P>The Whigs &s;ay, the &s;peech is artfully drawn, and made popular, for
&s;ome &s;ini&s;ter ends; notwith&s;tanding, they will be as trouble&s;ome as they
can, and &s;ay they will make my lord trea&s;urer unea&s;y; but he laughs at
them, and values not what they can do. The next parliament will be
as good, if not better, than this. The Queen relies entirely on the loy|alty
of her &s;ubjects; which is as much as to &s;ay, that Hannover mu&s;t do
the &s;ame, if he comes here, and be and lead by the mini&s;try and
parliament.</P>
<P>Both are wording the addre&s;&s;es. There will be warm debates about the
wording of them. There will be new changes every day. My lord
Chomley gave up his &s;taff as comptroller of the hou&s;ehold, ye&s;terday,

that the &s;peech was too conde&s;cending, and &s;o much in favour of Hall
[Hannover], that it will be work of time to make the menworthy [mob]
to forget him. Overton [Harley] an&s;wered, that he mu&s;t fight the
waggs [Whigs] with their own weapons, and &s;ilence them all at once, and
make the jewellers [Jacobites] more mode&s;t, Hall [Hannover] and
<PB N="403" REF="420">

be for him, he will have the copy-hold [the crown], and 'tis prudence
to run with the tide, <HI>i. e.</HI> with the inclination of Mr. Keepers [the king|dom].
Noble told him, 'tis a mi&s;taken policy to conde&s;cend too much
to Hall [Hannover] or the waggs [Whigs], who won't think the better
of him for't. I know he hopes, by this means, to make Hall [Han|nover]
abandon the waggs [Whigs], and believes now he will. If he
does, the waggs [Whigs] will renounce and declare again&s;t him. Time
will &s;hew. Ab. B. [Abb&eacute; Butler] was with Noble [Netterville], and tells
him Mr. Kemp [the King] is a Quiete&s;t, and tells every body of it, and
what he does is by orders. Noble [Netterville] wi&s;hes it may be believed;
for any thing will go down better than a Phi&s;s [Roman Catholic].</P>
<P>I had yours of the 9th in&s;tant ye&s;terday; am well plea&s;ed to know Mr.
Ken's [the King's] mind. We will take mea&s;ures accordingly. There's
&s;ome things fit to be imparted to Overton [Harley]. If you think well
on't, it &s;hall. Ja&s;per [lord Ilay] and Arbuthnot [lord Argyle] did not

<P>"APLETON [lord Athol] has got the &s;taton middle [the privy &s;eal],
and is gone to Intler's hou&s;e [Scotland] to regulate the affairs of
that hou&s;e. Overbury [duke of Ormond] goes to John&s;on's hou&s;e [Ireland]
to put the gold [government] of that hou&s;e into hone&s;t hands. The
Allen [army] there is to be reduced from 12 to 8, that of Evelly [Eng|land]
will be reduced to 10 m. The Waggs [Whigs] will be bla&s;ted, and
then di&s;carded. Their management will be cen&s;ured in Hangel's hou&s;e
[hou&s;e of commons] to-morrow, and then expo&s;ed to the world. They
will fall unpitied. Did the menworthy [mob] but know the roguery of the
late mates [mini&s;try], they would tear them to pieces. Overton [Harley]
will endeavour to keep them in the dark, as much as he can, and as long
as he can; the rea&s;on you &s;hall know by word of mouth.</P>
<P>Arbuthnot [Argyle] begins to be ob&s;treperous. Overton [Harley]
thought to make him his &s;muggler [&s;py] on the Waggs [Whigs], and bully
them on occa&s;ion; but he will do nothing for him, till he gets Hawley's
[duke Hamilton's] place. Overton [Harley] won't tru&s;t him with it.
Arbuthnot [Argyle] is re&s;olved to hector him into it. Overton [Harley]
makes &s;atires on him, in order to expo&s;e him, and thinks to &s;ilence him;
time will &s;hew how they will end. The Waggs [Whigs] will &s;pirit him
to be unea&s;y to Overton [Harley] and Quaint [prince&s;s Anne]. They
&s;ay, they will move to have Mrs. Strange [prince&s;s Sophia] here; but I
am told, by &s;ome &s;en&s;ible men among the partners [parliament] they will
get no point by it; for they had enow of &s;trangers. They talk kindly
of Mr. Jenkins [the King], at lea&s;t to me, and begin to hate Hall
[Hannover] more and more, becau&s;e the Waggs [Whigs] &s;tand up for
him. He has his &s;even bra&s;s candle&s;ticks in Hungal's hou&s;e [hou&s;e of
commons] which opens lightly in his favour. One of them &s;aid, the
other day, that it was fitting Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] &s;hould have no map
[money] before the portion [peace] was laid before them; if the &s;tature
large [great &s;eal] be put to it, &s;he &s;hould not be a&s;hamed of letting them
<PB N="405" REF="422">
&s;ee it; but got no point by the brazen impudence. The next thing they
will do, is to object again&s;t every point of the portion [peace] to make
the mates [mini&s;ters] odious; and Egleton's [the Emperor's] &s;tanding
out, as he does, will give them a further handle to cavil. I mu&s;t tell you,
by the by, if Egleton [the Emperor] would but clo&s;e with Knox [King
of France] the Duncans [Dutch] will be forced to vomit up what they
are to get by this pardon [general peace], and of cour&s;e, will be glad to
give a helping hand to Mr. Kennedy [the King]. He would do well to
make a propo&s;al of this kind to him, by his nephew there. I knew full
well, the Waggs [Whigs] make him and Hall [Hannover] believe
Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] won't live long, and of cour&s;e, he mu&s;t come here,
and then renew the weatherhot [war] again.</P>
<P>I have given convincing arguments to Egleton's mates [Emperor's mi|ni&s;ters]
that he mu&s;t not believe the Waggs [Whigs] any more. I fore|told
him every thing that happened him hitherto. He now finds it to be
true, to his co&s;t. I know Overton [Harley] and his brethren would be
glad on't; for it would give them a good handle to call Mr. Kennedy
[the King] home, and run no ri&s;que or hazard of life or fortune. It is
true, the mates [mini&s;ters] have enough under their thumb, to ju&s;tify
their conduct in this point; but they are coverts [cowards]; &s;o you &s;ee
we mu&s;t drive that nail as far as it goes. You may depend on't they will
keep the &s;ame conduct with Mr. Kennedy [the King] as they did in mak|ing
the portion [peace], and carry things on with the &s;ame caution,
which you'll &s;ay, will be tedious; but they think it more &s;ure. Overton
[Harley] is a goe cart, that mu&s;t be pricked as he goes along.</P>
<P>It is therefore, Rogers put a precept [paper] into his hand, the other
day, that Moul&s;worth [lord Churchill] care&s;&s;es Hall [Hannover] mightily,
and is putting him on coming to Evelin's hou&s;e [England] with a good
allen [army]. This and &s;everal other precepts [papers] he has given
him, with which he &s;eemed well plea&s;ed, and no doubt will have good
effect, which is all that offers, at pre&s;ent, from, dear Sir, &amp;c.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> <DATE>April 24, 1713.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>"I Had the honour of yours of the 20th in&s;tant, and can tell you, Ro|gers
de&s;igns to wait on you, as &s;oon as practicable, which will
hardly be before the 1&s;t of June, or Mid&s;ummer. There is a lady from
Hannover, that has &s;ome pretentions in the French court, where &s;he
will be recommended from hence, and from prince&s;s Sophia. He will
put him&s;elf into her retinue, and may be u&s;eful to her in France. Prin|ce&s;s
Sophia will take it kindly of any body, that will do this lady any
&s;ervice. Rogers conceives he may be, by her means, being under &s;o
great a prince&s;s's protection, more u&s;eful to Mr. Evans [Sir William
Ellis] and his ma&s;ter [the King], becau&s;e he can appear barefacedly.
He mu&s;t, therefore, wait her time.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, dear Sir, be under your direction, whether I &s;hould &s;ee Peyton.
[Polignac] or Tradenham [Mon&s;ieur de Torcy] before I &s;ee you. I
conceive I mu&s;t &s;tay &s;ome time at Putney [Paris] before I go to your
parts; and, if I &s;hould &s;ee any body el&s;e, before I &s;ee Tradenham [Mon|&s;ieur
de Torcy] or Peyton [Polignac] it won't be taken well. If it could
be ordered &s;o, that I could &s;ee Mr. Ben&s;ongs [duke of Berwick] as I ar|rive
at Putney [Paris], it would be of u&s;e; he is, I know, a favourite at
Knox hou&s;e [King of France]. I am re&s;olved to talk to none but him
and Mrs. Quarnington [the Queen]. I expect, by your next, to know
your mind and will, as to this point.</P>
<P>I was la&s;t night, with the gentleman [Mr. Sheridan, I &s;uppo&s;e]. He
has the writings I &s;poke to you of before. He tells me they are ready
for the pre&s;s. They will &s;ee whether Egleton [the Emperor] comes to,
<PB N="407" REF="424">
by the time prefixed; if he does, what relates to him, will be &s;truck out;
for they don't think &s;it to expo&s;e him. About the clo&s;e of the &s;ummer
[&s;e&s;&s;ion] they will publi&s;h them, in order to &s;ower the Chammi&s;men
[country gentlemen] again&s;t the Waggs [Whigs], and to keep up their
&s;pirits, till the new partners [parliament] are cho&s;en. I find he gutted
the precepts [papers]; for, &s;hould they print them, <HI>in haec verba,</HI> the men
worthy [mob] would tear the Waggs [Whigs] in pieces. Overton
[Harley] &s;ays, there is a medium between Scylla and Carybdis, and will
keep it as much as he can. The partners [parliament] will carry on their
bu&s;ine&s;s &s;moothly and roundly, with little or no noi&s;e, but with caution,
and manage that of the &s;ape [&s;ucce&s;&s;ion] as they did the portion [peace],
and take their own time to do it, and it will be left entirely to them.
This I know to be Overton's [Harley's] mind, and his &s;cheme, which will
be put in execution, when things are ripe for it, which cannot be before
the next new partners [parliament] meets. This you will find to be true.
I find Mr. Yates [lord Yarmouth] will be provided for, and a great
many of Mr. Kennedy's [the King's] friends advanced, after a little
time, which is a good &s;ign.</P>
<P>As for news, we have little or none. The parliament took off two
&s;hillings in the pound, which will make it&s;elf a high church parliament.
The Whigs are mad at this, and will be more, e&s;pecially if the parlia|ment
gives the broken officers their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e it will
&s;creen the mini&s;try and them, and what they can do. To-day or to-mor|row
it will be known what will be done in it; &s;o that the Whigs will have
nothing left to &s;care the vulgar with but Popery and the Pretender, e&s;|pecially
if they can't get Hannover&s;ent for.</P>
<P>They got the higher hou&s;e of convocation not to join the lower, in an
addre&s;s of thanks to her Maje&s;ty, for the peace. There are ten bi&s;hops
again&s;t the addre&s;s, and &s;ix pro; &s;o that it is believed, the body of the
clergy mu&s;t addre&s;s alone; they got the bank and the E. I. C. in their
hands, which make them more in&s;olent.</P>
<P>It is believed my lord Peterborough will be made duke of Monmouth,
or at lea&s;t, marquis.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t how the hou&s;e voted half-pay to the land and &s;ea officers. The
Whigs oppo&s;ed the latter. This will make the mini&s;try more popu|lar.
<PB N="408" REF="425">
Notwith&s;tanding the u&s;age Egleton [the Emperor] met with here,
yet he will tru&s;t and cringe to Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] and mates [mini&s;|try]
&s;ooner than to Knox [King of France], for he &s;ent one to her; pray

<P>"I Told him, that the King was well, and going to Luneville to make

repeat here the &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e two letters. You was and are &s;till de|&s;ired,
to a&s;&s;ure Mr. Knowles's [the King's] relations, that he is very &s;en|&s;ible
of Stuart's [Scotland's] kindne&s;s, and of the particular marks he
hath given him thereof, all along. That he could &s;end no directions to
him, of late, about his affairs, becau&s;e he is in the dark him&s;elf, and has
been advi&s;ed by his be&s;t friends to lie quiet, and not to &s;ay or do any
thing, till he &s;ees clearer, what Dunbar [prince&s;s Anne] and Gooldings
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, [Harley] intended to do; &s;o he hopes Stuart will not attri|bute
all this nece&s;&s;ary prudence of Knowles [the King], to any neglect,
or want of friend&s;hip and confidence in him; for I am authorized to a&s;&s;ure
you, that he has a true and ju&s;t value for Stuart [Scotland] and all his
hone&s;t relations; and I hope, in time, he will be able to give them &s;olid
proofs of it, and that he is incapable of ever having any unju&s;t partiality
for E&s;tmore [England], in prejudice of Stuart.</P>
<P>I told you al&s;o, that his friend Manning [lord Middleton] has the &s;ame
&s;entiments, and is as hearty a well-wi&s;her of Mr. Stirling [Scotland], as
<PB N="409" REF="426">

cannot be more heartily again&s;t Uperton [the union], than he is and al|ways
was, which Scot him&s;elf can witne&s;s; &s;ince he had directions from
him from the beginning, to de&s;ire all his friends to oppo&s;e him with their
utmo&s;t might, when his law-&s;uit was depending; and indeed, to think

This was &s;ent to a bitter enemy of Overton's [Harley]: 'tis therefore I

find 'tis the be&s;t way to make him do hone&s;t and fair things.</P>
<P>I have no news worth your notice, only the Scots make a noi&s;e.
Their repre&s;entatives in both hou&s;es met in a tavern, where they were not
long, when the D. of Argyle and my lord Mar went from the lords,
Lockhart and Coulcairn from the commons, to wait on the Queen, to
tell her, they could not &s;ee their country ruined; and a&s;ked her leave to

fir&s;t; upon which, they returned and met &s;everal times &s;ince. My lord
Seafield moved, ye&s;terday, in the hou&s;e of lords, to go upon the &s;tate
of both nations. The motion was adjourned till Monday. The Whigs
are indefatigably bu&s;y to open, as they &s;ay, the eyes of the people, and
give out they'll let the world know, that day, how the nation has been
impo&s;ed upon and grieved; and give out, they'll &s;end my lord trea&s;urer
to the Tower. But you'll find all the&s;e heats will end in fumes and
vapours; though the Scots &s;ay, they'll lay a foundation for a gan|gernie.</P>
<P>Arbuthnot [lord Argyle] is night and day with the Waggs [Whigs],
who will ply Overton [Harley] very warmly. The mates [mini&s;ters]
will connive &s;o far with them, as to &s;end him to Tracy [the Tower].
They won't &s;ee him ruined. He laughs at all this. For he has Snap

a&s;&s;ure you, Rogers laid a foundation for this matter, which you &s;hall
know in due time; 'twill make you laugh.</P>
<P>I am told, by a good hand, Arbuth. [lord Argyle] will be turned out
of his all. Newam, alias Dan, will have the &s;tature-middle [privy &s;eal],
and the gold [government] put into the hands of Charles [the High
church] and his [its] friends.</P>
<P>The friends of Hall [Hannover] are upi&s;h, and think the day will be
their own. They wrote to him lately, that the mates [mini&s;ters] and
Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] are on a tottering foundation, and will break
Overton's [Harley's] neck; of which I gave him an account, two days
ago, and that Strange [P. Sophia] will never &s;ide with the Tanners
[Tories], nor abandon the Waggs [Whigs]; this I hinted as well to
Beaumont [lord Mulgrave], who &s;eemed well plea&s;ed with it. This ani|mates

in the Hou&s;e of Commons, when rejected, in compliment to Sir Thomas
Hanmer, by the Earl of Oxford.</HEAD>
<P>"SIR Thomas Hanmer was &s;ent over, in 1712, to the D. of Ormond
(who&s;e relation and friend he was) in Flanders, and after that came
to Paris, where he was received, by the King of France's order, like a
prince. Never had a private man &s;uch honours paid him.</P>
<P>There, he put the la&s;t hand to the Treaty of Commerce; which very
treaty, he afterwards, when &s;peaker, u&s;ed his intere&s;t to throw out.</P>
<P>When that treaty was to come before the hou&s;e, and &s;everal debates
had been held on it, ju&s;t as the la&s;t debate for the final determination of
the affair came on, the earl of Oxford wrote a letter, as L. L. told me
April 23d 1724, to Mr. Bromley, telling him, that he would, by no means,
be an occa&s;ion of a breach among friends: that he would willingly let all the
blame lie upon him&s;elf, and the treaty be given up, rather than make a
divi&s;ion. Nor would there have been a divi&s;ion in the hou&s;e that day,
had not Sir Richard Vyvian got up and &s;aid, that he had &s;tudied the
point of commerce: that he found the treaty admirably calculated for
the advantage of England, and he had grounded his notion on the be&s;t
informations; and that he could not bear to &s;ee a matter given up,
out of a compliment to any body's notions, when his country was to
receive a prejudice by it; and he laid the foundation of a debate, which
la&s;ted till 2 in the morning, being carried on purely on a country-foot,
and the treaty rejected, by only about 8 votes. Lord L. dined that day
with lord Oxford, who was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear, that the hou&s;e was &s;itting
<PB N="421" REF="438">
at nine o'clock, and could not imagine how it happened, nor did then
take a &s;tep to carry the point; whereas, as lord L. told me, had he but
&s;ent a note to his brother Ned, or cou&s;in Tom Harley, the court intere&s;t,
which was neuter, would have fallen in with the country, and the treaty
would have certainly been ratified: &s;o that this point was left, to the in|finite
prejudice of England, only out of a compliment of the earl of Ox|ford
to Sir Thomas Hanmer.</P>
<P>A. O. told me, Sir T. Hanmer and the B. of R. were the two per&s;ons

He &s;peaks him&s;elf with re&s;pect of Mr. Philips [lord Middleton]; but
told her of what I &s;hall tell you on the other &s;ide of this; and the young
gentleman that came with Mr. Jacob's [King of France's] fir&s;t agent here,
has been no friend to Mr. Philips [lord Middleton]; but, on the con|trary,
has in&s;inuated things to the agent (who&s;e &s;ecretary he is) injurious
to our friend; altogether, they have &s;pread &s;uch a &s;u&s;picious character,
that does, and will be of a very bad con&s;equence to him, who&s;e honour
and truth can &s;tand the te&s;t of all their &s;u&s;picions; but it deters and
frights the great traders from engaging their &s;tocks. I cannot &s;ay it is
by the in&s;tigation of Mr. Ford [lord Melfort] or his brother; but I find
the per&s;on that told Mrs. White was intimate with both: for, in di&s;cour&s;e,
he told her, that Mr. Ford [lord Melfort] had &s;everal times wept, in re|lating

he propo&s;ed for Mr. Jenkins' [the King's] advantage. He corre&s;ponds

was not lord Fingale that told me that. The duke of Powis told me, he
did not &s;peak or tru&s;t him&s;elf to my lord Middleton's &s;ons, and repeated

Then he repeated, that he was the cau&s;e of Mr. Hamilton's leaving Mr.
Jenkins [the King]. So &s;he concluded it was from that, that the mali|cious
report came; but now &s;he finds that it came both ways. Mr.
Rogers is an ill figure of a man, and as ill an utterance; but what he has
fallen into, by chance, is very extraordinary, and I believe that filly ap|pearance
has been of great help to him, in doing what he has done. I
believe you will &s;ay what he has writ was well done, and like a man of a
better appearance. He will be &s;erviceable when at the great town [Paris],
and Mr. Harris [Harley] will &s;ee what he &s;ends, and &s;upply him in the
factory. He is hone&s;t. The traffick will require Mr. Philip's [lord
Middleton's] and your head to manage. He has promi&s;ed me to have
to do with no other, in this traffick, but your friend [he means my lord
Middleton] and you. Mr. Peregrine [Fergu&s;on] would have him to trade
with Mr. St. [Stafford], that is, with Mrs. Rachell [the Queen]; and the
per&s;on I have named would have him trade with Mr. Ine&s;e, who he trades
with; but he a&s;&s;ures me he will attend Mrs. Philips [my lady Middleton],
and by her, trade with Mrs. Racheil [the Queen], and then buy and
&s;ell by Mr. Philip's [lord Middleton's] and your direction. It is odd that
Peregrine [Mr. Fergu&s;ion] &s;hould have, under Mr. Jenkins's [the King's]
hand, to be one of the factors for pre&s;ent chalk [ca&s;h], one of his cir|cum&s;tances;
<PB N="426" REF="443">
for none here will deal with him in that way, he is &s;o indi|gent,
and other things alledged. I believe very well of him; but many
others do not. What I name of the fifty pounds given, mu&s;t not be
named, only to know if that per&s;on has ever acknowledged to have re|ceived
that &s;um of the man I have named; for he &s;corns to name it
only to know if it be approved his giving it &s;o; becau&s;e he pretends to
have direction to be one of the factors named to receive an account of
trade for Mr. Jenkins [the King]; he would have had as much more &s;ince.
This per&s;on would have refu&s;ed a thou&s;and pounds him&s;elf, or two hun|dred
a-year to the fund, if there had been a compliance from others of
the manufactory. What he wants in under&s;tanding the trade, he makes
up in zeal and bravery of &s;pirit for the good of the company. What I
mean, of not knowing he has told any other than Mrs. White is, I cannot
prove he has, though I don't doubt but he has, becau&s;e of the report
being &s;pread; though yet I cannot fix it on any particular per&s;on, that
has been told it by him. You will judge, when you &s;ee Mr. Rogers,
what is fit to let him know; &s;ince tho&s;e he will deal with here, will ac|quaint
Mr. Harris [Harley] with what he writes; for they are at his de|votion
to all intents; and he not at all a friend, only will have it in his
power at once, if he finds it will be &s;o without him, to &s;eem to have had
always the intention, and waited for an opportunity; for that is the true
character of Mr. Harris [Harley]. I find that Mr. Innes, I have named,
is no friend to Mr. Philips [my lord Middleton], and I am &s;ure tho&s;e of
his character do Mr. Jenkins [the King] great injury, by being with him
at this time, and his not being in their hands, as his father was, has done
him a great &s;ervice; &s;o that his being there is not well. I de&s;ire Mrs.
Philips [my lady Middleton] will receive Rogers well, and not think wor&s;e
of him for his figure. I wi&s;h Mr. Philips [lord Middleton] would write
him&s;elf a kind letter to Mr. A&s;kine [lord Ayle&s;bury], my friend, that was
at Bru&s;&s;els, who is now at Paris, and ill of an ulcer in his bladder. He has
long taken it ill he did not an&s;wer his letters, which is the rea&s;on he does
not write there, though he is &s;till the &s;ame. Mr. Ford [my lord Mel|fort]
has been once to &s;ee my friend [lord Ayle&s;bury], and he returned
it, but no more friend&s;hip will ever be betwixt them. I do not know if
Mr. Rogers can &s;upport him&s;elf, or if he expects to have a con&s;ideration
from tho&s;e concerned, who are to reap the benefit. I believe Mr. Harris
<PB N="427" REF="444">
[Harley] will take care, under-hand: for, by what I have found out, he
is at the bottom; but I am fully per&s;uaded Rogers is truly zealous for
the good of the manufactory, and indeed every action has proved it; and
the u&s;e that can be made will be of con&s;equence. Adieu.</P>

<P>"I Have &s;poken to lord Fingale. He has told me three things alledged
again&s;t my lord Middleton. One, that when F. Plowden was &s;ent
on the King's bu&s;ine&s;s, another father of theirs was taken in Flanders;
and when they found it was not Plowden, they let him go, and that my
lord Middleton was the man that knew of this bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;econd
thing was, that young Sheridan told my lord, that his father was &s;ent to
the Elector of Cologne, who promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King with money: but
when Sheridan came, he &s;huffled him off, becau&s;e he found all de&s;igns
were di&s;covered to tho&s;e here. The third was, that a letter &s;ent by
duke Hamilton, was &s;ent back to the prince of Orange, and that he
&s;hewed it him, and, in a plea&s;ant manner, bid him do &s;o no more. My
lord a&s;ked the duke him&s;elf, if this was true; who an&s;wered, it was fal&s;e,
and &s;poke of my lord Middleton with re&s;pect, and not at all &s;o of my
lord Melfort. That of Mon&s;ieur Pontchartrain I find my lord Fingale
&s;poke of to the Queen: but &s;he told him he [Pontchartrain] was angry
with my lord Middleton, and was a pa&s;&s;ionate man; but he [lord Fingale]
did not &s;peak to her [the Queen] in the very bare terms he [Pontchar|train]
&s;poke them to him [lord Fingale], which were as I writ them in my
la&s;t. But now this lord is convinced, that all this is occa&s;ioned by ma|lice
and de&s;igns, and de&s;ires, that my lord Middleton will be plea&s;ed to
&s;end him his in&s;tructions, what the King would have moved in parlia|ment
this next &s;e&s;&s;ion: for &s;everal of the hou&s;e, that de&s;ire to be cho&s;en
<PB N="428" REF="445">
again, de&s;ire him to know what the King would have them do, and they
will do it. Sir John Packington has promi&s;ed to be the leading man, and
the re&s;t promi&s;e to &s;econd it, and I know &s;everals that &s;ay they will. Sir
William Whitlock &s;ays, he will, who is a leading man. If the King ap|proves
of it, they will call for the box, where the names of tho&s;e are, whom
prince&s;s Sophia &s;ent to be commi&s;&s;ioned to have the government in their
hands, till &s;he could come after the death of prince&s;s Anne. This was &s;ent
when they thought her a dying; and then the parliament, if the box be
produced, will declare again&s;t the choice, as men that are again&s;t the con|&s;titution,
and will take the occa&s;ion to prove, that there are a number
of Papi&s;ts in employments in that &s;tate, and that they have built them a
church; and then prove all the di&s;re&s;pectful things which that court has
done again&s;t prince&s;s Anne and the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, and, by degrees, fall
on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which, if the parliament is as they expect, will be as
good as the old."</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ubject is continued in the remaining part of the letter;
and the key to it is interlined, in the original, by Sir William Ellis.</P>
<P>"MOST tenants are di&s;po&s;ed pretty well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original.</NOTE> if Mr. Harris [Mr. Har|ley]
would once re&s;olve it was to be done;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. iv. 4 to No. 46.</NOTE> but he will keep in
with both. Tho&s;e five, [Sunderland, Somers, Halifax, Cowper, and
Ru&s;&s;el,] he met, and, as I told you in a former letter, he is in clo&s;e
coun&s;el with, and does many things by their in&s;tigation. The book-keeper
that was with Mr. Jacob [lord Bolingbroke] he would have out of the
office, and give him a place of more profit; but he will not change, be|cau&s;e
he knows what he means by it; if the laws do go for Mr. Jenkins
[the King], and that all the management cannot hinder him, then he
[Mr. Harley] will appear as a main witne&s;s, el&s;e he has taken &s;uch mea|&s;ures
as will ju&s;tify him, and will have tho&s;e five per&s;ons to prove how he
concerted all tho&s;e things for the good of Mr. Sandy [Hannover], tho'
he did not believe him his friend; and this is what that per&s;on who is
hourly with him [lord Fingale] &s;ays of him. He is &s;o afraid of Mr. Med|lecote
[the parliament], he dare not do more for Mr. Sandy [Hannover]
openly; but he renders all things of no effect, that is offered as to his
prejudice, and &s;till gives a politic rea&s;on for it, that every one in his
club clearly &s;ees what he aims at. That prince&s;s Anne's &s;peech, at going
away of Mr. Medlecote [the parliament], was &s;o ordered, he could not
<PB N="429" REF="446">
help her &s;aying what &s;he did; becau&s;e he that it belonged to &s;o to order
it, had contrived to have it &s;o, and argued the point to Mrs. Anne Smith
[prince&s;s Anne]. As &s;he con&s;ented, &s;o he could not change it, though
he attempted it. I &s;poke to you before of Mr. Rogers; he is, I do truly
believe, an hone&s;t man. Mr. Harris [Mr. Harley] does certainly know of
his journey, further than the great town [Paris], though it is his confi|dant
that does employ him. Mr. Rogers will clear this point to you.
The par&s;on [lord Fingall] I have named to have told me this, in regard
of Mr. Philips [lord Middleton], is no man of great parts, but mo&s;t
zealou&s;ly hone&s;t to his friend and relation [the King]; his wife, who is at
the great town [Paris], has &s;ent to him to come, and &s;ays that Mr. Ford's
broker [lord Melfort], that was the fir&s;t about Mr. St. John's [the duke
of Perth], de&s;ires him to come to him; he laughs with me at that, and
&s;aid he thinks it was a great way to go to make him a vi&s;it: he &s;aid he was
intimate with his brother [lord Melfort]; but never was but three times
with him [duke of Perth]. He does not &s;ay his brother [lord Melfort]
did tell him any thing I have writ; it was what I could not in manners
a&s;k him. I find Parker was well acquainted with him, who he thinks
mad. All I could &s;ay I did, to undeceive tho&s;e that had handed tho&s;e
malicious reports on hear&s;ay, to come to a ju&s;ter opinion.</P>
<P>Mr. Laur [Sir Con&s;tantine Phips], that was my council, that is not
here now, I have heard from lately, by one that came from him; he is
&s;incerely a friend to Mr. Jenkins [the King], and de&s;ires he may know
he is &s;o. He has gained great reputation where he is.</P>
<P>Pray, with my mo&s;t faithful &s;ervice, a&s;&s;ure Mr. Philips [lord Middle|ton]
that none on earth more truly honours him; that I beg he will be
plea&s;ed, by you, to direct you to write &s;uch a letter, as I may &s;how the
per&s;on I have named [lord Fingall]; only thus, in an&s;wer to my letter.
He gave me leave to de&s;ire him to give me &s;uch directions as were ap|proved,
that he may deliver to tho&s;e of Mr. Medlecote's family [the par|liament],
as I have here named; what I have told, in relation to Mr.
Philips [lord Middleton] him&s;elf, he has not given me leave yet to tell
him; but he &s;aid, after &s;ome time, he would give me leave to acquaint
him, for it was unju&s;t that &s;uch fort of reports &s;hould not be cleared,
and that he was for what was ju&s;t, and then what was mo&s;t proper to be
done to cultivate all the family's intere&s;t together; for that was the way
<PB N="430" REF="447">
to do &s;omething effectually; for this is the time before the next term, for
all depends upon it. All has been trifling till now, it is come to the
deci&s;ion of all. If this time be lo&s;t, there will be but an ill pro&s;pect of
recovering the e&s;tate. Mr. Rogers is obliged to be where Mrs. Rachel is
[at Paris], for &s;ome time before he can &s;ee Mr. St. Johns [the King]; for
there is &s;omething to be done there that will regard Mr. Harris [Harley],

<P>"Mr. Lorimer [the duke of Lorrain] continues to be very kind to

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I Am &s;orry to find you lay &s;o much &s;tre&s;s upon Mr. Smith's [the
King's] living [being] or not living [being] in Forbes's [catholic]
family, as if the i&s;&s;ue of his law &s;uit depended upon it, when Mr. Ander|&s;on
[E. Mar] him&s;elf knows, that it would be again&s;t all law to ca&s;t him
upon that account; &s;ince therefore, you have been &s;o plain with me, upon
this &s;ubject, confiding in your friend&s;hip, I will u&s;e the &s;ame freedom
with you, in telling you my thoughts of this matter.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, if Smith's friends require this condition from him,
they do him no favour; for he could compound, at that rate, with his
greate&s;t enemies, and with Cramond him&s;elf [the Whigs].</P>
<P>In the next place, living or not living with Forbes, mu&s;t be a volun|tary
act of one's own free choice, otherwi&s;e it cannot an&s;wer the ends for
which it is required. It would be but cheating and impo&s;ing upon one
another, which is neither Smith nor Cant's [Church of England's] in|tention.</P>
<P>If Smith be willing, on one &s;ide, as certainly he is, to give Cant's fa|mily
all the marks of favour and friend&s;hip, that can be a&s;ked of him,
for the benefit of the family, I think it a little hard, on the other &s;ide, that
Cant [church of England] &s;hould not allow him the liberty that all free|men
have, to live where he plea&s;es, and to follow his own judgment, in a
thing that relates only per&s;onally to him&s;elf, and can be of no real pre|judice
to Cant.</P>
<P>If he were to trade with a Cramond [Whiggi&s;h] mob, I &s;hould not
wonder at any hard&s;hip of that kind, from &s;uch people. But I hope
Cant's [church of England's] relations are men of too good principles,
to refu&s;e the liberty to Smith him&s;elf, which he is willing and ready to &s;e|cure
to all their family, in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t authentic manner that
they them&s;elves can de&s;ire.</P>
<P>They own, that the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e in que&s;tion, is altogether in|dependant
of Mr. Talbot [religion]; therefore, to deal ju&s;tly and im|partially
<PB N="437" REF="456">
with Smith, they &s;hould begin by deciding his law &s;uit; and af|ter
he is in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, then he and Cant [church of
England] may talk of Talbot's concerns [religion], with more honour
and freedom, and le&s;s &s;u&s;picion of being bia&s;&s;ed by views of intere&s;t, than
at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, that I know Smith to be very nice upon that point:
for, if it were to receive a crown, he would not do a thing that might re|proach
either his honour or his &s;incerity. He de&s;ires a union of confi|dence,
friend&s;hip, and intere&s;t, with Cant [church of England], above all
things, becau&s;e he thinks him an hone&s;t man, and they may be mutually
u&s;eful to one another. For that rea&s;on, he &s;eeks all occa&s;ions to oblige
him, and to make all tho&s;e of his relations that are with him, ea&s;y; and
it is for their &s;atisfaction, that he has brought a per&s;on lately into his fa|mily
who has free liberty to &s;erve them, in their own way.</P>
<P>He had rea&s;on to hope, that Cant would be &s;atisfied with this te&s;timo|ny
of his good-will towards him; and that in return, he would be as ea&s;y
to him, as he has been to his relations; but, in&s;tead of that, he has met
with more unea&s;ine&s;s, upon that &s;ubject, than he had before; what he
meant only for the comfort and &s;atisfaction of his friends having been in|terpreted
beyond what he intended, which has drawn &s;everal un&s;ea&s;ona|ble
teazings upon him, on one &s;ide, and occa&s;ioned ra&s;h judgments, on
the other. He cannot help people's &s;peaking; but it were to be wi&s;hed,
at lea&s;t, that his friends had &s;poke of Talbot [religion] and him with
more caution and prudence than they have done. For their late reports
have done him no good; on the contrary, they have expo&s;ed him to be
looked upon, as a wavering, intere&s;ted, and di&s;&s;embling &s;pirit, which is
quite the rever&s;e of his character.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t de&s;ire you, therefore, as you love Smith's intere&s;t and reputa|tion,
to u&s;e your endeavours to &s;ilence their groundle&s;s reports, wherever
you perceive they may do him harm, and to prevail all you can with
Cant's [church of England's] chief relations, not to teaze upon Forbes's
[catholic] account, in &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a conjuncture as this is. Let them
a&s;k for them&s;elves whatever they plea&s;e. He loves them &s;o well, that
he will refu&s;e them nothing that can tend to make them happy and &s;ecure
them in their e&s;tates. This which he hath &s;o often promi&s;ed, and re|&s;olves
<PB N="438" REF="457">
&s;till, in due time, to perform, &s;hould be &s;ufficient, and to a&s;k more,
e&s;pecially at this time, would neither be friendly nor ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, having told you freely my mind, I hope you will make
your own prudent u&s;e of it, and employ your intere&s;t, when occa&s;ion
offers, with Ord [prince&s;s Anne], Jones [Harley], Bambery [St. John],
and others of your friends, in ca&s;e any of them have any good will to|wards
Smith [the King], to per&s;uade them to be contented to trade with
him upon the foot here mentioned, which is certainly the &s;ure&s;t for both
&s;ides; for whatever he promi&s;es they may depend upon, nor will he leave
it, even in his own power to deceive them. Whereas, if he &s;hould, at
this &s;u&s;picious time, part with his old friend Forbes [Catholic] &s;o ea&s;ily,
or be any ways moved thereto by the motives repre&s;ented to him, by Mr.
Ander&s;on, it would not be prudent in any of his new friends, to tru&s;t him
half &s;o much, as they may &s;afely do, remaining as he is, e&s;pecially when
he offers to give them all the demon&s;trations of his friend&s;hip, firmne&s;s,
and &s;incerity, that con&s;cience and honour will allow him."</P>

<P>"AS for your affairs here, I can &s;end you nothing new; you will &s;ee
now, in a &s;e&s;&s;ion or two, whether I &s;hall ever be &s;o happy as to
&s;ee you here, or not. I have no hopes any further than this, that I per|&s;uade
my&s;elf, that it is the intere&s;t of tho&s;e that are to &s;erve you, to &s;erve
you, and that they have no other refuge to fly to. Now if this be as I
imagine, yet &s;ome think it impracticable, becau&s;e of the difficulty of &s;et|tling
the e&s;tate, whether it &s;hall be parted, or that our friend [the King]
&s;hould have it, after his relation's death, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I do not concern my&s;elf much about the&s;e difficulties, becau&s;e I believe,
that if you are to have any good done you, tho&s;e that de&s;ign it you will
ea&s;ily find out an expedient to do it by. My opinion is, that the generality,
e&s;pecially tho&s;e in place here, are wholly guided by intere&s;t, and that
&s;etting that a&s;ide, it is equal to them, whether this or that per&s;on is put

expect to have yours re&s;tored, that they may enjoy theirs, which other|wi&s;e,
I think, they cannot do. I have heard, that the worthle&s;s lord

This, the Tories, though they could not refu&s;e to join in it, being near
the time of electing a new &s;enate, only laughed at them for: for when
the addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented to the Queen, that of the upper hou&s;e was
attended only, by five or &s;ix Whig lords; that of the lower, by twenty
Whig &s;enators. This I write, that you may know how well people &s;eem

<P>"I Had four letters from Noble [Mr. Netterville], la&s;t night, which
imports, that the duke of Shrew&s;bury goes to Ireland in 14 days,
to call a parliament, and put that kingdom into hone&s;t hands. He is
to come back to England, in four months. The changes go on by de|grees
to Mr. Kennedy's [the King's] advantage; none but his friends
advanced or employed, in order to &s;erve the great project. I am de|&s;ired
to tell you, Mr. Kennedy [the King] and tho&s;e about him are to
obey and ob&s;erve what in&s;tructions are &s;ent him from England, from
time to time, and that, in &s;ix or eight months, things will be ripe and
forward to be imparted to him. I am at liberty to go thither; but mu&s;t
not make any &s;tay, for rea&s;ons he don't think fit to be told now.</P>
<P>Bolingbroke and Oxford do not &s;et their hor&s;es together, becau&s;e he
is &s;o dilatory and dozes over things, which is the occa&s;ion there is &s;o
many Whigs cho&s;en this parliament, though there are four Tories to one,
they think it little; but I think, if there were more Whigs it were
better.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="459">
He tells me, the hou&s;e of commons will let no prime mini&s;ter govern
for the future, but manage the main point, and make the crown depend|ent
on them. They will give money to have a &s;hare of it them&s;elves;
by this he gives to under&s;tand, that if Knox [the King of France] would
but &s;end his agent over &s;oon with a good &s;pell, Mr. Kennedy [the King]
might &s;oon go home. They are hungry; a pound now will go further
than ten another time. I gave de Torcy an account of all this matter;
but I believe it will be to little or no purpo&s;e; for it is a maxim with
him, not to believe Mr. Kennedy [the King's] friends.</P>
<P>I continue to fix Mrs. Strange [prince&s;s Sophia] again&s;t Overton [Mr.
Harley] and he again&s;t her. I wrote him, la&s;t night, that I &s;aw a letter
from her and her &s;on, which &s;ays, he is a worthle&s;s hollow-fellow. She
complains the Engli&s;h do not go much near her now, of late.</P>
<P>Noble [Mr. Netterville] tells me, in his letters, the parliament will put
in the Queen's power to name her &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and if &s;he lives a little longer
Hannover will never &s;ee England. The duke of Berwick will be here
the next week. I am to go to De Torcy with him, and tell him what's
proper, and tell him what orders I have from England; doubtle&s;s, he
won't be again&s;t my going to &s;ee you there. Noble [Netterville] truly
tells me, that it is but curio&s;ity of both &s;ides; therefore, is not very fond
of my going yet, till he &s;ees how matters go. The parliament will be
very active and &s;tirring. The trea&s;urer and mini&s;try look on the German
mini&s;ter, re&s;iding in England with &s;uch di&s;dain and contempt, and he on
them, that they are ready to fly in one anothers faces when they meet.
The Whigs call them&s;elves the church Tories, to deceive the people;
but they get no profit by it. Queen is now very well; but the Whigs
&s;ay &s;he will die next winter, and gives the Emperor hopes Hannover
will come over; for they tell them, the moment the church party goes
about to &s;et a&s;ide the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or declares for the Pretender, the mob
will come over to them, as they did to the Tories in Sacheverel's time.
This they write abroad daily to their corre&s;pondents here and el&s;ewhere,
I am, &amp;c."</P>

don't know whether they gave that &s;atisfaction you de&s;ire. It may be,
they were not explained, as they ought, or I meant. The circum&s;tance
I was then in obliged me to write dark, and not de&s;cend to particulars;

that you a&s;&s;ure us the contents have been and will be punctually ob|&s;erved:
it's what your uncle's [the King's] friends hope may be for his

Snow [Scotland], are mighty di&s;obliged; and William&s;on [the Whigs]
&s;till &s;upported, contrary to all the rules of common prudence, &s;uppo&s;ing

his real intere&s;t they &s;hould be; though all this, I &s;ay, be very melancholy
and di&s;heartening, yet your uncle [the King] continues &s;till re&s;olved to
try what time, patience, and all good offices, on his &s;ide, will produce;
leaving (as you &s;ay very well) the event to God Almighty, and to
Charles's [prince&s;s Anne] and Honiton's [Harley's] con&s;ciences. But
when Proby [the parliament] comes to town, we &s;hall be better able to
judge how matters will go; for it is rea&s;onable to believe, that then or
never &s;ome people will &s;how them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The medal you mention to have been &s;ent, the 14th of Augu&s;t,
never came to hand. John [the King] would have valued it for the lady's

If it be &s;o, I wi&s;h &s;he may &s;how it &s;oon, for time is precious, and
delays in that match may be fatal to both.</P>
<P>May not you get Autry [Auchterhou&s;e] to tell Honiton [Harley]
plainly what his friends complain and blame him for? We hear Autry
<PB N="445" REF="464">
has a great intimacy with him, and perhaps he may prevail with him to
alter his methods, when he demon&s;trates how prejudicial they are to his

&s;tick to him.</P>
<P>Jeremy [the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing] is well, and goes in a fortnight to &s;ee his kind
landlord. Lamb [Le&s;ly] is well, and has all kindne&s;s &s;howed him; but

<P>"I Had a letter, la&s;t night, from Noble [Netterville], with the follow|ing
occurrences: That the Emperor and Dutch &s;corned and con|temned
of late the Queen and her mini&s;ters. He will give Oftend and
all the towns in Flanders to the Dutch, becau&s;e he thinks he will vex the
Engli&s;h. The Whigs are &s;o &s;owered again&s;t the Tories now, that they
want but &s;trength to ri&s;e up in arms. They gave out lately, through the
three kingdoms, the Pretender was turned prote&s;tant, to feel the pul&s;e of
<PB N="446" REF="465">
the Tories; but, having gained no point by it, they now &s;ay it was a re|port
from Lorrain, and the contrary was wrote from Bar. They brag
they have a faction &s;trong enough, if not to bring over Hannover, to
keep out the Pretender at lea&s;t this &s;e&s;&s;ion; in the mean time, the Queen
may die. They'll get the Emperor to hold out another campaign. They
contrive to advance him money, as they have done already. They think
to put the mini&s;try on &s;ome extreme, and on a nece&s;&s;ity to call France
to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and con&s;equently bring home the Pretender, hoping
thereby to get the people of their &s;ide, as the Tories got them by Dr.
Sacheverel's trial.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try, now &s;eeing they can't bring the Emperor to a peace,
concluded to &s;end Shrew&s;bury to call a parliament in Ireland, to &s;it at
the &s;ame time with that of England; a thing not u&s;ual. They are re|&s;olved
now to go through &s;tich with the changes through the three king|doms.
Tney mu&s;t now &s;ink or &s;wim with France. The Whigs know it,
and will pu&s;h them on to it, in order to ruin the Tories; but all to no
purpo&s;e. They per&s;uade the German mini&s;ters at London, the Emperor
may have the &s;ame terms after the next campaign as now. If he lo&s;es
ground, the balance is lo&s;t; therefore, the mini&s;try mu&s;t get him the
&s;ame terms that was offered at Utrecht, or el&s;e the people will fly in their
faces, and oblige them to renew the war, to &s;ecure the balance of power.
The&s;e arguments, however chimerical in them&s;elves, make an impre&s;&s;ion
on the Germans, and leave a &s;ting in the minds of the people.</P>
<P>Marlborough de&s;ires to go and live in England this winter; but the
Queen can't as much as hear him named. Some few attempted to keep
the prince&s;s Sophia's birth-day; but they were affronted. There was
but one flag hung out of one &s;teeple in all the town: a good &s;ign. The
Scots commoners half mild, half &s;tale. The lords right: money will gain
them at any time. Argyle will be &s;oon turned out, and his employment
given to hone&s;t men.</P>
<P>The trea&s;urer is mortified at the Emperor, and the Dutch proceedings.
He fore&s;ees he can't, as he de&s;ired, renew an alliance with them, or bring
them into his mea&s;ures. The factions were never &s;een &s;o high as now.
There will be warm doings in both hou&s;es. How the trea&s;urer &s;hall &s;tem
the current, you &s;hall know per next, from, &amp;c."</P>

Whigs. Their friends in England will a&s;&s;i&s;t to thwart the mea&s;ures of

Innes, and de&s;ired him to give them into the con&s;ul's own hands, and, if
he de&s;ired it, to read them to him; and then that you make your re|marks.
And I hope the con&s;ul won't let them go out of his own
hands, or &s;uffer copies to be taken of them, but after he has peru&s;ed them

the con&s;ul might be at home ere now. I wrote, almo&s;t every po&s;t, to

<P>"After this, having left the &s;ecretary's office, in which I had been
&mdash;years under &s;ecretary, during earl Melfort, lord Caryll, and earl
Middleton's mini&s;try, the King was plea&s;ed to make me &s;ecretary of the
clo&s;et; in which &s;tation I writ only, from time to time, &s;ome letters to
England, by his Maje&s;ty's immediate orders, of which I kept no copy;
only &s;hewed them always to his Maje&s;ty before I &s;ent them. But the

my letters to Rome in a book apart from that time."</P>

in England.</HEAD>
<P>"ROGERS having, for &s;ome years, been educated in Gerard's hou&s;e
[Germany], Mr. Egleton [the Emperor] recommended him to
Mrs. Strange [prince&s;s Sophia], who recommended him to &s;ome of our
friends among the Waggs [Whigs], and Egleton [the Emperor] like|wi&s;e
recommended him to his agent, then re&s;iding in Evelin's hou&s;e
[England]. This gave the &s;aid Rogers an opportunity to contract a
<PB N="452" REF="471">
friend&s;hip and intimacy with the &s;aid agent, and the men of bu&s;ine&s;s
among the Waggs [Whigs], whereby he had an opportunity of &s;erving
Mr. Jenkins [the King], when Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] made the late regulation.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Rogers having, by his daily conver&s;ation with Quack [Mr.
Pen a Quaker], Noble [Netterville], and others, that were very inti|mate
with Overton [Mr. Harley] and the re&s;t of his brethren, found their
pul&s;e beat very low, and that they were at a lo&s;s to maintain the new re|gulation; and it was therefore they care&s;&s;ed the agents of Egleton [the
Emperor], and Simon's hou&s;e [Savoy], to bring them into their intere&s;t,
in order for a pardon general [a general peace] with Knox [the King of
France], exclu&s;ive of Duncan [the Dutch.]</P>
<P>Rogers, perceiving this would prejudice the intere&s;ts of Jenkins [the
King], found ways and means to fru&s;trate their de&s;ign, which he brought
about in the following manner.</P>
<P>He being very intimate with one of the &s;harpers of Egleton's agent
[&s;ecretary of the Emperor's amba&s;&s;ador], who was ma&s;ter of all his &s;o|phi&s;try
[&s;ecrets], got a precept [a paper] which contained in &s;ub&s;tance,
that the Tanners [Tories] care&s;&s;ed the &s;aid agent [mini&s;ter] then more
than ever, making him great offers, in ca&s;e he would join with them as
above: but he a&s;&s;ured his ma&s;ter Egleton [the Emperor] that &s;uch great
offers of the Tanners [Tories] were an infallible &s;ign they were not in a
condition to &s;tand their ground long, and a&s;&s;uring him the Waggs
[Whigs] had laid &s;uch a foundation as would turn the &s;tream into its for|mer
channel; and that there was no rea&s;on to apprehend the Tanners
[Tories] would dare to deal &s;eparately with Knox [King of France], or
run the ri&s;que of giving any jealou&s;y to Anabapti&s;ts [the allies], or offend|ing
the men worthy [the mob].</P>
<P>Rogers, after having got this precept [paper] in his hand, did &s;ignify
to Noble, Quack, and Overton [Netterville, Quaker Pen, and Mr.
Harley] that the Waggs [the Whigs], in conjunction with the Anabap|ti&s;ts
[the allies], were re&s;olved to &s;upplant Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] and
him, and al&s;o that it was in his power to let him know all their &s;ophi&s;tries
[&s;ecrets]; telling withal, that his chief aim in this was purely to &s;erve
Mr. Jenkins [the King], Whereupon Harris [Harley] an&s;wered, that
<PB N="453" REF="472">
he did not di&s;like his fidelity to his friends, a&s;&s;uring him that he &s;hould
find his account in what &s;ervice he &s;hould do for him and Quaint [the
Queen].</P>
<P>Hereupon Rogers gave him the afore&s;aid precept [paper], and all the
precepts [papers] that the agent &s;ent to Egleton [the Emperor] and Dun|can
[the Dutch], from time to time, to the number of about twenty-four;
containing, in &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;chemes they had laid for continu|ing
the weather hot [war] or cold. In order thereunto, the agent prepared
a memorandum to be given in Egleton's [the Emperor's] name, to
Quaint [prince&s;s Anne]; &s;etting forth, that he could rai&s;e treble the allen
[army] he had hitherto. <HI>Nota bene,</HI> that the Agent, at the &s;ame time,
advi&s;ed his ma&s;ter to make large promi&s;es, till he could gain his point in
Evelin's hou&s;e [England]; and afterwards, that ways may be found to
evade the performance of them with credit.</P>
<P>Which was to be printed and publi&s;hed, in order to gain the men
worthy [mob], and exa&s;perate them again&s;t Quaint [the prince&s;s], Over|ton
[Harley], and his brethren; and another precept [paper], giving
an account that Simon's hou&s;e [Savoy] would &s;tick no longer to Egleton's
[the Emperor's] intere&s;t, but would look to him&s;elf; and another pre|cept
[paper], &s;ent from Ri&s;ton [the King of Portugal] to Egleton [the
Emperor], importing that he would follow Quaint's [the prince&s;s Anne's]
&s;teps. Another precept [paper], propo&s;ing a method of removing
Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] out of tru&s;t [the throne]; and another pre|cept
[paper], containing a method how to prolong the weather hot [war]
for two years longer. The&s;e, with many other matters, too long to
mention here, being given by Rogers to Harris [Harley], made &s;uch
impre&s;&s;ion on Quaint [prince&s;s Anne], and Overton [Harley], that they
immediately re&s;olved upon dealing even &s;eparately with Knox [King of
France].</P>
<P>Rogers, perceiving the agent to be dejected upon account of his be|ing
&s;lighted on this occa&s;ion, di&s;cour&s;ed with him as u&s;ually, and made
a bye motion to him to reconcile him to Kennedy's [the King's] intere&s;t;
but he being &s;o much elated by the repeated a&s;&s;urances of the Waggs
[Whigs], refu&s;ed to favour it. Whereupon Rogers attacked him an|other
way, and told him there was a project &s;et on foot by Lewis [old
Danby], Overton [Harley], and the re&s;t of the &s;ociety, to marry Mr.
<PB N="454" REF="473">
Kemp's [the King's &s;i&s;ter] to Knell [the King of Sweden]; and, by that
means, to re&s;tore him, exclu&s;ive of Mrs. Strange [the prince&s;s Sophia].</P>
<P>The agent communicated this to his chief confidents among the Waggs
[the Whigs], who were &s;o alarmed at it, that they rai&s;ed all the Devils
in Hell to prevent it, and &s;aid, that of the two evils, they would rather
have Jenkins [the King], though a phy&s;ician [a Roman Catholic], than
that &s;uch a project &s;hould take, which would knock all their mea&s;ures
down at once, and ruin for ever them and their friends the Anabapti&s;ts
[the allies].</P>
<P>Whereupon they &s;ent to Hall [Hannover], that he would &s;end his
agent immediately to Evelin's hou&s;e [England], to take care of his in|tere&s;t;
who, thereupon, gave in a memorandum, which &s;erved Quaint
[the prince&s;s Anne], Cleveland [cabinet council], and the partners [par|liament]
to a great degree never to be forgotten. Beaumont [lord Mul|grave],
Segrave [lord Shrew&s;bury], and the re&s;t of the &s;ociety, except
Overton [Harley], were of opinion that the agent &s;hould be &s;ent away
with Moulins [a me&s;&s;enger], but Overton [Harley] &s;aid it was not &s;ea|&s;onable,
for &s;everal rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e the pardon general [general
peace], was not &s;o far advanced as to rely upon Knox [King of France]:
&s;econdly, that it would give a great cau&s;e of jealou&s;y to the men wor|thy
[the mob], which may draw them away; and thirdly, becau&s;e it
would make the jewellers [Jacobites] in&s;olent, and give Kemp [the King]
greater hopes of e&s;tabli&s;hing his intere&s;t than otherwi&s;e he could expect.
Upon the&s;e rea&s;ons that bu&s;ine&s;s dropt.</P>
<P>The Waggs [Whigs] finding that the memorandum had not the ef|fects
propo&s;ed by it, they &s;ent to Evers [prince Eugene] to come with all
&s;peed to Evelin's hou&s;e [England], in order to lay before Quaint [prin|ce&s;s
Anne] and partners [parliament] the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing the
weather hot [war], and how Knox [King of France] bought the pardon
general [peace] for maps [money]; to retrieve which, the Waggs
[Whigs] were &s;ure to carry the point, by the majority they a&s;&s;ured
them&s;elves in Holton [hou&s;e of Lords] and Hungate [hou&s;e of com|mons],
by &s;ending two or three of Clevland [cabinet council] to Tracy
[the Tower of London.]</P>
<P>Rogers having an indenture [intelligence] of all this from Egleton's
[Emperor's] agent, then living at Hatton's hou&s;e [the Hague], gave the
<PB N="455" REF="474">
&s;aid indenture to Overton [Harley], and the re&s;t of his brethren; upon
which, Moul&s;worth [lord Churchill] was laid a&s;ide, which mightily &s;ur|pri&s;ed
Evers [prince Eugene] at his arrival. Upon this, Moul&s;worth
[lord Churchill] told Ivers [prince Eugene], that had he come before
the new dozen were made in Holton [hou&s;e of lords], all would do well,
and that now more violent mea&s;ures mu&s;t be u&s;ed rather than fail; which
Ivers [prince Eugene] agreed to con&s;ult with Jonathan [the junto] and
partners. Whereupon he propo&s;ed to gather together a great many of
the men worthy [mob] to be led by &s;ome of Jonathan [the junto] and
partners, (to de&s;troy in the night-time, after a frolick&s;ome manner)
Overton [Harley], Hervy [Sir Simon Harcourt], and one or two of his
principal companions: but Hall's [Hannover's] agent, did not approve
of this method, conceiving it would turn the hearts of the men worthy
[mob] again&s;t his ma&s;ter, but Jonathan [the junto] and partners being
divided in this:</P>
<P>Ivers [prince Eugene] propo&s;ed another way, which was to &s;et fire
to &s;everal hou&s;es in Little Town [London], and e&s;pecially near South's
hou&s;e [St. James's]; and, by this means, rai&s;e all the men worthy
[mob]; and the Waggs [Whigs] being &s;ure of the Gapers [Guards],
Quaint [prince&s;s Anne], together with the Exchange [Exchequer], and
Tracy [the Tower], were to be &s;eized, and thereupon immediately
new partners [parliament] to be called; but Horn [Halifax], Sands
[Somers], and the late Collier [Chancellor], did not approve of this.</P>
<P>All this Rogers communicated to Overton [Harley], thinking Ivers
[prince Eugene] would be &s;ent to pain [pri&s;on]; but finding that Over|ton
[Harley] &s;hewed it to Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] and not to Clevland [cabinet council], he, by Yates [lord Yarmouth], &s;ent, under hand, a
detail of the whole matter to Beaumont [lord Mulgrave] and the pre&s;ent
Collier [lord Keeper], who laid it before Clevland [cabinet council], at
which Overton [Harley] was very much &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;tarted; but told
Clevland [the cabinet council], that he had the &s;ame account, which he
gave to Quaint [prince&s;s Anne], and another mate [mini&s;ter of &s;tate],
&s;aying that Quaint [prince&s;s Anne], finding they were divided among
them&s;elves, thought it more prudent to &s;mother it. To which Clevland
[cabinet council] replied, that it concerned them too near not to &s;ift it to
<PB N="456" REF="475">
the bottom; therefore, ordered that Rogers &s;hould be called immediately
before them, to give a full account of the whole matter. Overton
[Harley] &s;ent immediately for Rogers, and &s;poke to him as followeth.</P>
<P>Rogers, you have been betrayed in the &s;ophi&s;try [&s;ecret] and precepts
[papers] you gave me; to which Rogers replied, that he gave it by Mr.
Noble's [Netterville's] advice to Farringdon [Fergu&s;on], to lard a pre|cept
[paper] that he had then in hand with the heads of it for Quaint's
[prince&s;s Anne's] u&s;e; wherewith Overton [Harley] &s;eeming to be &s;atisfied,
a&s;ked him what cour&s;e was proper to take in the matter. Rogers,
knowing what would be acceptable to him, propo&s;ed to go with him be|fore
Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] or any of the mates [mini&s;ters]; and ac|cordingly
he ordered Rogers to go along with him to Quaint [prince&s;s
[Anne]. But Beamont [lord Mulgrave], having a hint of this from
Rogers, underhand, ordered him to come before Clevland [cabinet
council], which he accordingly did, and was examined upon all the pre|cepts
[papers] which he (from time to time, during the &s;pace of two
years before), gave Overton [Harley]; and having al&s;o declared the
manner of his obtaining them, Clevland [cabinet council] was &s;o much
&s;atisfied therewith, that Rogers was de&s;ired to reduce his examination,
which la&s;ted two hours and a half, with all the circum&s;tances, into writ|ing,
and at parting returned him thanks, with a promi&s;e of a &s;ettlement
during life; and gave po&s;itive orders that he &s;hould be forthwith &s;ent to
Ha&s;&s;el's hou&s;e [Holland], to bring back his friend, from whom he had
Ivers's precept [prince Eugene's paper], and to di&s;cover further the pro|ceedings
of Duncan [the Dutch] and the Waggs [Whigs].</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that Beamont [lord Mulgrave] whi&s;pered Rogers,
that he &s;hould be full and particular in his journal, becau&s;e it would
turn to his own and friend's [the King's] advantage. Overton [Harley]
gave the following rea&s;ons again&s;t his going to Ha&s;&s;el's hou&s;e [Holland].
Fir&s;t, that if it &s;hould be found out that a phy&s;ician [Roman Catholic]
&s;hould be employed upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, at that juncture, it would
give the Waggs [Whigs] an occa&s;ion to clamour. Secondly, that it
would be enough to divide the Anabapti&s;ts [allies]; and that Evelin's
hou&s;e [England] would never be tru&s;ted hereafter, if they &s;hould ex|po&s;e
the&s;e &s;ophi&s;tries [&s;ecrets] before the partners [parliament]: and,
<PB N="457" REF="476">
thirdly, that it would give Knox [King of France] an opportunity to
make what portion [peace] he plea&s;ed, when he found the Anabapti&s;ts
[allies] jealous of each other, and divided among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e rea&s;ons, Rogers was ordered to go on
his journey; who, coming to Rymer's hou&s;e [Rotterdam], he met his
confident, and engaged him to come back to Evelin's hou&s;e [England],
where he &s;hould be provided for during his life. He liked the offer, but
in&s;i&s;ted upon having it under the &s;harper's [&s;ecretary of &s;tate's] own hand.
This Rogers communicated to Overton [Harley], but had no an&s;wer.
It is to be ob&s;erved, that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e matters did properly
belong to the &s;harper's [&s;ecretary of &s;tate's] province, yet Overton [Har|ley]
took it into his own management, in order to conceal it from Clev|land
[privy council], and communicate it only to Quaint [prince&s;s
Anne], and keep Rogers out of the way as long as he could, to prevent
his being tampered with by Clevland [cabinet council].</P>
<P>Rogers was not long in Ha&s;&s;el's hou&s;e [Holland], when Ciprian ar|rived
from Putney [Paris] at Hatton's hou&s;e [the Hague], and gave
three memorandums, one to Harpers [pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius], one to
Hall's agent [Hannover agent], and a third to Egleton's agent [the Em|peror's
amba&s;&s;ador], containing in &s;ub&s;tance all what he and his father
tran&s;acted in Evelin's hou&s;e [England]; and that he had contracted in
Knox's [King of France's] name with Clevland [cabinet council], and e&s;|pecially
with Overton [Harley], for a great quantity of maps [money],
in ca&s;e he &s;hould agree to give a &s;eparate portion [peace]; and that
Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] de&s;ired him to tell Mr. Jenkins [the King] that
&s;he would &s;end for him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This was acceptable to the above-mentioned three per&s;ons, who &s;aid
it was the only thing they wanted; and that they had enough to undo
Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] and de&s;troy Clevland [the cabinet council], and
prevent the pardon general [the general peace]. Rogers, being apprized
of all this matter, acquainted Overton [Harley] therewith, as he did
likewi&s;e Doyle, Peyton, and Mead [mari&s;hal D'Uxelles, Abb&eacute; Polig|nac,
and Mr. Menager], a&s;&s;uring them, that now they had a good game
in hand, which, if rightly managed, would turn to Knox's [the King of
France's] advantage, and forward the portion [peace] to their &s;atisfac|tion.
They a&s;ked how? Rogers an&s;wered, that Ciprian was to be &s;ent

<PB N="457" REF="478">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">

with good recommendations to Mould&s;worth [lord Churchill], and to the
chief of the Waggs [Whigs] dignified with titles of honour and good
characters from Hall [Hannover] and Egleton [the Emperor]; and that
he the &s;aid Rogers would go with him to Evelin's hou&s;e [England],
and introduce him fir&s;t to Clevland [cabinet council], to let him &s;ee all
the precepts [papers] he had along with him, which would be accept|able
to Clevland [cabinet council], who would engage him in Quaint's
[prince&s;s Anne's] intere&s;t, in order to expo&s;e the &s;ophi&s;try [&s;ecret] of the
Waggs [Whigs] and Duncan [Dutch], and lay the &s;ame before the part|ners
[parliament], which would infallibly give them a plau&s;ible handle
to de&s;troy the &s;hape of Hall [&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Hannover].</P>
<P>Mead [Mon&s;ieur Menager] replied, that it was not prudent to hazard
the breaking the mea&s;ures &s;o well concerted, wherein Rogers had a good
&s;hare; and the &s;aid Mead [Mon&s;ieur Menager] well under&s;tood that
Rogers aimed at the immediate re&s;toration of Kennedy [the King] to his
tru&s;t [throne], and &s;aid Knox [the King of France] would take care of
that, after fini&s;hing the pardon general [the general peace]. Rogers an|&s;wered,
that now was the proper time, and that &s;uch a favourable occa|&s;ion
would never offer again; and told them, that he would &s;end Ciprian
to Stapleton [lord Strafford], who went the day before to Ha&s;&s;el's hou&s;e
[Holland]; upon this, the three retiring a&s;ide, and con&s;ulting a while
together, they told Rogers, that Tradenham [Mon&s;ieur de Torcy] &s;ent
for Ciprian, in order to give him new in&s;tructions to take care of his affairs
in Evelin's hou&s;e [England]; and, by that means, he might have a better
opportunity of &s;erving both Knox [King of France] and Kennedy's [the
King's] intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>They, finding that poor Ciprian did bite at this bait, very wi&s;ely &s;ent
him away to Putney [Paris], not doubting his &s;incerity.</P>
<P>But Rogers, having a watchful eye upon him, and di&s;covering his in|tentions
of going directly to the Waggs [Whigs], got him, by a &s;tra|tagem,
to Ha&s;&s;el's hou&s;e [Holland], and acquainted Stapleton [lord
Strafford] with the whole matter; who approved of Rogers' conduct, in
&s;ending him to Clevland [cabinet council]; and offered to &s;end Moulins
[a me&s;&s;enger] along with him; but Ciprian &s;hewing Harper [Hein&s;ius]
the orders which Doyle [Mare&s;chal D'Uxelles] and his companions gave
<PB N="459" REF="480">
for going fir&s;t to Tradenham [Mon&s;ieur de Torcy] to receive his in&s;truc|tions,
he approved of it, and de&s;ired him to go with &s;peed; and promi&s;|ing
him all the humour [honour] and pinimo [pen&s;ion] he could de&s;ire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N. B. Ciprian having propo&s;ed Rogers to vouch the truth of his allegation, Harper [Hein&s;ius] con&s;ulted with, the agents of Hall and Egleton about &s;ecuring Rogers; but he being apprized of it, avoided the &s;nare.</NOTE>.
So he accordingly went to Tradenham [Mon&s;ieur de Torcy], and how
he was received the reader knows.</P>
<P>Upon this, Rogers told Doyles [Mare&s;chal D'Uxelles] and his fellows,
that a good &s;cheme was &s;poiled, if this fellow &s;hould be kept in pain
[pri&s;on]; and that it was &s;acrificing Kennedy's [the King's] intere&s;t to
theirs, at pre&s;ent. To which Doyles [Mare&s;chal D'Uxelles] replied, that
Quaint [prince&s;s Anne] and Knox [King of France] would do his [the
King's] bu&s;ine&s;s in due time; and &s;aid, that, for his part, he would be
&s;ure to acquaint Knox [King of France] how active Rogers has been in
his and Kemp's [the King's] affairs, both there and in Evelin's hou&s;e [Eng|land];
and that he acted like a man of honour, e&s;pecially in this particular.</P>
<P>Rogers finding that all the parleys [plots] he propo&s;ed, for a pre&s;ent
replication [re&s;toration], mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide for a time, he thought of
another, which he expected may turn to as good account, which is as
follows.</P>
<P>During his abode in Ha&s;&s;el's hou&s;e [Holland], he luckily met with a
relation of his own, who was conver&s;ant with the principal men that go|verned
that hou&s;e [&s;tate], and found, by his friend's and his own ob&s;erv|ation,
that Ha&s;&s;el's hou&s;e [Holland] was governed by Waggs [Whigs]
and Tanners [Tories], as well as Evelin's hou&s;e [England]; and that the
Waggs [Whigs] are the per&s;ons now in vogue; and that the Tanners
[Tories] being in ob&s;curity during this long reckoning [revolution] were
meditating a long time to bring about a replication [re&s;toration] there,
after the &s;ame manner as in Evelin's hou&s;e [England].</P>
<P>Rogers, being introduced by his friend to the chief of the&s;e Tanners
[Tories] found, by di&s;cour&s;ing with them, that they wanted only a little
map [money] to compa&s;s their ends; wherein there was no difficulty, as
in Evelin's hou&s;e [England]. He, upon this, propo&s;ed to Knox's [King
<PB N="460" REF="481">
of France's] agents, among them, to &s;upply them; and having prevailed
with them to &s;end to the &s;aid per&s;ons, who came and made out that they
could infallibly do it without noi&s;e or &s;tir, by be&s;towing a &s;mall matter on
&s;uch as &s;hould be &s;tubborn; with this the agents [amba&s;&s;adors] &s;eemed
well plea&s;ed, and a&s;&s;ured them, that Knox [King of France] &s;hould be
acquainted with their good intention; but Peyton [Abb&eacute; Polignac] told
Rogers, that he believed Knox [King of France] would hardly hear of
this propo&s;al, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting the mates [mini&s;ters] of Evelin's
hou&s;e [England]. Rogers replied, that he would &s;end to get Clevland's
[cabinet council] con&s;ent, but he was called away before he could have
an an&s;wer. He acquainted Clevland [cabinet council] therewith, which
was well approved of; but Overton [Harley] &s;aid, that the portion
[peace] was far advanced, and it would be better to defer it till after the
pardon general [general peace], becau&s;e it would weaken the politician
[prote&s;tant] intere&s;t abroad; &s;aying, that although Duncan [the Dutch]
&s;hould be humbled, yet Knox [the King of France] &s;hould not be
exalted.</P>
<P>Rogers, &s;eeing that Knox [the King of France], in conjunction with
Overton [Harley], was intent upon &s;ecuring their own game, did re&s;olve
to ply Overton [Harley] warmly, by &s;etting Clevland [cabinet council]
upon his back; which he did, by communicating to Beaumont [lord
Mulgrave], by Yates [lord Yarmouth], what he wrote to Overton [Harley],
from time to time, during his abode at Ha&s;&s;el's hou&s;e [Holland], viz.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that Moul&s;worth [lord Churchill] wrote to Harper [Hen&s;ius] and
Evers [prince Eugene] not to let the foreign allen [army] in Quaint's
[prince&s;s] Anne's &s;ervice obey Overbury [duke of Ormond], thinking
thereby to prevent Knox [King of France] giving up Dean's hou&s;e [Dun|kirk]
to Quaint; and this would give the Waggs [Whigs] a plau&s;ible
handle to &s;end Overton [Harley] and one or two more to Tracy [the
Tower] and con&s;equently would be a good excu&s;e for Knox [King of
France] to abandon Quaint.</P>
<P>Secondly, he di&s;covered at Hatton's hou&s;e [the Hague] the new plan
framed by Moul&s;worth [lord Churchill], Horn [Halifax], and Sands
[Somers], for bringing Hall [Hannover] to Evelin's hou&s;e [England],
by publi&s;hing a model [a manife&s;to], containing that Kennedy [the King]
was coming from Fitches' hou&s;e [France] with a phy&s;ician allen [a
<PB N="461" REF="482">
Roman Catholic army], and arrived at Sutler's hou&s;e [Scotland]; and that
Hall [Hannover] was arrived at Evelin's hou&s;e [England], to &s;ecure the
copyhold [crown] again&s;t Kemp [the King], and that Moul&s;worth [lord
Churchill] was to have a good allen [army] of his own. By this means,
they did not doubt but the unthinking menworthy [mob] would join
them, and that Quaint [prince&s;s Anne], upon this occa&s;ion, would doubt|le&s;s
e&s;cape, as Mr. Kemp [the late King] did at the late reckoning [Re|volution].</P>
<P>This plau&s;ible project was &s;ent to Mrs. Strange [prince&s;s Sophia], not
doubting of her approbation, and give her con&s;ent to young Hall [Han|nover]
going to Evelin's hou&s;e [England].</P>
<P>But the more penetrating heads among the Waggs [Whigs] advi&s;ed
her, underhand, to be wary in &s;o important an affair, and avoid all things
that would give the Tanners [Tories] a good pretence to alter the &s;hape
[&s;ucce&s;&s;ion].</P>
<P>Hall [Hannover] &s;ent his agent to know the &s;trength of the Waggs
[Whigs], and in ca&s;e he found their intere&s;t to be as they repre&s;ented it,
he was to be governed by them, and accordingly the agent keeps very
clo&s;e to them, who are fully re&s;olved to pave the way for Hall [Han|nover]
this &s;ummer of partners [&s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament].</P>
<P>By this they propo&s;e to gain two points; fir&s;t, in ca&s;e the Tanners
[Tories] oppo&s;e it, then it's clear they are for Kennedy [the King], which
will give umbrage to the menworthy [mob], and draw them away from
the Tanners [Tories]. Secondly, They expect to have a majority among
the next partners [parliament].</P>
<P>Rogers wrote to Overton [Harley], that the per&s;on from whom he had
all the&s;e &s;ophi&s;tries [&s;ecrets] &s;hould be &s;ent to Evelin's hou&s;e [England]
to prove it <HI>viva voce;</HI> but had no an&s;wer while he was at Ha&s;&s;el's hou&s;e
[Holland], which may fall heavy on him hereafter.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1713" UNIT="year"> TO throw light on the Hannover papers of the pre&s;ent year, it is
nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e a few particulars. The baron de Bern&s;dorff
was pre&s;ident of the Elector's council, and M. de Robethon &s;ecretary for
emba&s;&s;ies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Secretaire des amba&s;&s;ades.</NOTE>. Baron de Grote was his Electoral Highne&s;s's envoy at the
court of London in the beginning of the pre&s;ent year. Grote died in
the month of April, and was &s;ucceeded by M. de Schutz, who&s;e father
had been in England &s;ome years before in the &s;ame character. Kreyenberg
was ordinary re&s;ident, and Galke &s;ecretary to the emba&s;&s;y. It does not
appear that Mon&s;ieur l'Hermitage acted in any public character from the
court of Hannover: he was probably connected with the Dutch emba&s;&s;y;
at lea&s;t, his bu&s;ine&s;s obliged him to go &s;ometimes to Holland. The let|ters
from London, &s;aid to have been &s;ent by a <HI>&s;ecret addre&s;s,</HI> were u&s;ually
directed to Mr. Siffen at the Hague.</P>
<P>The baron de Bothmar was the Elector's envoy extraordinary at the
Hague, and his mini&s;ter plenipotentiary at the treaty of Utrecht. Klin|graff
was re&s;ident, and Schrader &s;ecretary to the emba&s;&s;y. The originals
of all Bothmar's letters to Robethon are extant, and likewi&s;e the originals
of mo&s;t of the letters written to him by Schutz, Kreyenberg, and Galke;
but of &s;ome of them we have only copies in Robethon's hand, which he
decyphered for the u&s;e of the Elector and his mini&s;ters. They frequently
refer him for further particulars to their letters to Bothmar. Bothmar
&s;ent him copies of the&s;e letters, decyphered in Schrader's hand, and u&s;u|ally
marked in his own hand at the top, the date of the letter and the
name of the writer. As the&s;e copies are extant, we have probably all
the letters written by the Hannoverian agents from this country, from
<PB N="463" REF="484">
the beginning of April this year to the acce&s;&s;ion of George I. in Augu&s;t,
1714.</P>
<P>They, indeed, wrote regularly, by every po&s;t, to the Elector him&s;elf,
what they called a narrative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Une relation.</NOTE>; but in their letters to Bothmar, Bern&s;dorff,
and Robethon, they generally repeat in a &s;ummary manner what they
wrote at greater length to their ma&s;ter. As either the originals or au|thentic
copies of all their letters are extant, we are probably acquainted
with the whole &s;ubject of their corre&s;pondence, during a period, in which
the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was thought to be in the utmo&s;t danger, and de|&s;igns
were actually formed for bringing in the Pretender.</P>
<P>They &s;ent by every po&s;t a very particular account of parliamentary
proceedings: but it differs in nothing from what is publickly known;
and therefore has been entirely omitted. But every thing that they wrote,
of the private characters and conduct of the great men, who flouri&s;hed at
this period, has been carefully extracted; and we know, at lea&s;t, what
the Hannoverians thought of them, and in what light they were repre|&s;ented
by others.</P>
<P>De Grote was &s;ent to Great Britain to obtain a pen&s;ion for the prince&s;s
Sophia, and the arrears claimed by the Elector, as due to his troops which
&s;erved in Flanders, and to in&s;i&s;t upon the Pretender's removal from Lor|rain.
The court of Hannover, ignorant of that prince's attachment to
the principles imbibed in his youth, were alarmed this year with rumours
of his conver&s;ion; and directions were &s;ent to Grote to propo&s;e &s;ome
mea&s;ures which they thought nece&s;&s;ary to be taken in &s;uch an event.</P>
<P>The earl of Oxford made a motion in parliament, in the following
year, which, at the time, greatly &s;urpri&s;ed the nation: but now the true
cau&s;e of that mea&s;ure &s;ufficiently appears. The Whigs had invited the
Elector of Hannover to invade Great Britain, with an army. They, at
the &s;ame time, endeavoured to &s;how, that Oxford meant only to amu&s;e
the people, by an affected zeal for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to conceal his
real de&s;igns in favour of the Pretender. The motion bore, that, for the
further &s;ecurity of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it &s;hould be made high trea&s;on to bring
foreign troops into the kingdom. A law again&s;t bringing troops into
<PB N="464" REF="485">
Great Britain, to &s;upport the cau&s;e of the Pretender, was unnece&s;&s;ary;
&s;ince &s;uch troops, if foreigners, might be treated as enemies; and as na|tives,
might be puni&s;hed as rebels. Therefore, the de&s;ign of the earl of
Oxford was to allude, in his motion, to the &s;cheme of the Whigs to
bring over the Elector in a ho&s;tile manner.</P>
<P>The Queen, in her &s;peech to the parliament, which met on the ninth
of April in the pre&s;ent year, expre&s;&s;ed great zeal for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the
hou&s;e of Hannover. But the friends of that family con&s;idered the &s;peech
it&s;elf, and the con&s;equent addre&s;s of the two hou&s;es, as an artful de&s;ign of
the mini&s;ter to deceive the nation. The agents of Hannover, convinced of
this circum&s;tance by the Whigs, repre&s;ented to their court, the nece&s;&s;ity of
taking &s;ome &s;tep to bring the &s;incerity of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions to &s;uch a proof
as would convince the world, that neither friend&s;hip nor harmony &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
between the Queen and her mini&s;ters and the parliamentary heirs of
the crown.</P>
<P>The following letters were written by M. de Robethon, at Hannover,
to the Baron de Grote, in London, in January and February. They are
in Robethon's hand, in French; but decyphered by an unknown hand.</P>

<P>"LORD Oxford had mentioned the treaty of guarantee of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
to Kreyenberg, and con&s;equently would probably mention
it to Grote. Robethon de&s;ires Grote to propo&s;e to his lord&s;hip, in the
polite&s;t manner he could, to in&s;ert the corrections and additions which he
had mentioned in his preceding letter, and of which he now &s;ends him a
copy. He complains of it, as an omi&s;&s;ion very offen&s;ive to them, that
there was no mention of the Pretender in the treaty; and de&s;ires to
have the per&s;on known under the name of the Chevalier de St. George
particularly &s;pecified; "if it is in earne&s;t they have abjured the Cheva|lier;
if it is in earne&s;t they demand from France to remove him, and not
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; they cannot refu&s;e to mention him in the treaty of guarantee
of our &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. It is to be hoped the lord trea&s;urer will repair the
<PB N="466" REF="487">
omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential clau&s;e, and pay attention to the ju&s;t remon|&s;trances
of your Excellency on the &s;ubject."</P>
<P>Your Excellency may be a&s;&s;ured, that in the act which e&s;tabli&s;hes the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and in all the acts which have been made &s;ince concerning it,
even at the time when the Whigs had all the power in their hands, there
never was a clau&s;e in&s;erted for excluding the Pretender in ca&s;e he turned
Prote&s;tant; which, however, would be very nece&s;&s;ary. It will be &s;aid,
perhaps, that the popi&s;h lords likewi&s;e, who might be converted, would
be excluded thereby from the hou&s;e of peers. But there is a great dif|ference
between the &s;overeign and an individual. The Pretender, on the
&s;lighte&s;t appearance of a pretended conver&s;ion, might ruin all, the reli|gion,
the liberties, the privileges of the nation, &amp;c. This is not the ca&s;e
of a lord, and therefore it is not parallel. Be&s;ides, when they exclude
the Pretender, in &s;uch a ca&s;e they may, if they chu&s;e, make an exception
in favour of the lords who would change. Your Excellency will &s;peak
of all this to per&s;ons more capable of judging of it, than I am."</P>

pains which he takes to avoid you. You cannot be too diffident of him,
and you mu&s;t take care that we are not duped by him. We may depend
upon it, that Oxford is too far engaged with France and the Queen, to
dare to be able to withdraw; and even though he inclined it, it would be
impo&s;&s;ible for him to bring back the Queen to proper mea&s;ures; &s;o that
all he would gain, would be to meet with the &s;ame fate with Godolphin
and Marlborough.</P>
<P>On this account, and with this precaution, the attentions which you
propo&s;e to &s;how to that mini&s;ter, and the manner in which you intend to
behave to the Queen's mini&s;ters in general, are greatly approved of here;
and it gives great &s;atisfaction, that you are agreeable to Halifax and other

<P>With regard to the pen&s;ion, we think here, that Sunderland and So|mers
rea&s;on much better on the &s;ubject than Halifax; for, upon the &s;up|po&s;ition,
which is but too probable, of the lord trea&s;urer's intentions, the
great aim &s;hould be to unma&s;k him and the other mini&s;ters publickly,
and to open the eyes of the nation, which cannot be done but by the
means of &s;ome &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s as this, brought before the parliament:
whereas, whatever the Queen's mini&s;ters may be entreated to obtain from
France about the removal of the Pretender, or to add to the Barrier
Treaty, will not &s;trike the people, and will be liable to chicane; and
con&s;equently now, when the nation is alarmed on all &s;ides with the Pre|tender,
is the proper time to bring an affair of this kind before the par|liament.</P>
<P>I refer my&s;elf, on this &s;ubject, to the re&s;cript which you will receive,
&s;igned by our ma&s;ter, and add only that Bern&s;dorf, in particular, recom|mends

if, by the hopes you &s;hall give them both of a pen&s;ion, in ca&s;e the par|liament,

obtain &s;ome important &s;ervice from them. This in reality is a capital
point.</P>

If Oxford continues to avoid you, as I imagine he will, and if Boling|broke

arrears.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee, by the re&s;cript of our ma&s;ter, that lord Halifax's advice

</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In Robethon's hand, in French.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tran&s;lation.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;February 17, 1713.&mdash;"THE principal rea&s;on for the change of
the Queen's mini&s;try, was the de&s;ign of
e&s;tabli&s;hing the Pretender; &s;cruples were then rai&s;ed in the Queen's mind
concerning him, and lord Jer&s;ey endeavoured to &s;erve him, long before
the memorial was pre&s;ented by the baron de Bothmar. They have ex|erted
them&s;elves to bring about a peace, merely to pave the way for the
prince of Wales. That memorial had, at lea&s;t, the effect of making the
Queen's mini&s;ters proceed with more caution, and if we had done nothing,
all the con&s;equence would have been, that the&s;e gentlemen, meeting
with no ob&s;tacles, would have accompli&s;hed their de&s;ign much &s;ooner.</P>
<P>That lord Oxford is devoted irrecoverably to the Pretender and to the
King of France, is what we had no doubts of long ago, although his
cou&s;in, when he was at Hannover, endeavoured to impo&s;e, in that re&s;pect,
upon the Electre&s;s and the Electoral Prince, with whom I did not choo&s;e
to di&s;pute the &s;ubject, for they would not have failed to reproach me with
my partiality for the Whigs, and I choo&s;e rather to wait, until your Ex|cellency,
having ob&s;erved the matter your&s;elf, &s;hould bear te&s;timony to
this inconte&s;tible truth.</P>
<P>With regard to the project of going over with a body of troops now to
England, Mon&s;ieur de Bern&s;dorff would have wi&s;hed, that all that pa&s;&s;age
had been written in cyphers rather than any other; and his Excellency
orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> me to tell you, that as that de&s;ign requires ab&s;olutely the con|currence
of the States General, and their men of war, it is impo&s;&s;ible to
think of it at pre&s;ent; &s;ince the States General give their whole atten|tion
now to ha&s;ten the peace, and to gain the good graces of the Queen
and of her mini&s;try, imagining they have done enough for us, when they
&s;igned the treaty guaranteeing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. We mu&s;t, therefore, ac|cording
to Mr. de Bern&s;dorff, give time to the States General and to the
<PB N="473" REF="494">
Engli&s;h nation, to be &s;en&s;ible of the pernicious con&s;equences of the peace,
and then we may take ju&s;ter mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is, if the King of France will not, in the mean time, e&s;ta|bli&s;h
the Pretender by force; but how can we do otherwi&s;e? If the
Queen dies before the Pretender arrives, all things will be ea&s;ier, and the
States will be obliged, by their guarantee, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. But it is the opi|nion
of Mon&s;ieur de Bern&s;torff, that if it was nece&s;&s;ary during the Queen's
life time, to take &s;uch mea&s;ures again&s;t her Maje&s;ty and her mini&s;ters, we
would meet with terrible difficulties from the party in the nation who
love the Queen; be&s;ides, it is almo&s;t certain, the Elector, in that ca&s;e,
will never bring him&s;elf to &s;uch a re&s;olution. This your Excellency will
very ea&s;ily conceive; but we have every rea&s;on to hope, that, in ca&s;e of
the Queen's death, the Elector will do whatever can be expected from
him, of which your Excellency may, if you plea&s;e, give a&s;&s;urances to
our friends.</P>

long then as the Queen lives and the Pretender is out of England, and

lord Oxford not reli&s;hing it, and the memorial being pre&s;ented to him

<P>What procurations, patents, or orders, &s;hould we have ready to be &s;ent

<P>Mr. Bern&s;torff is of opinion, that, in ca&s;e of the Queen's death, as the
Electre&s;s cannot &s;et out immediately, nor travel with the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;|patch,
the Elector, or, on his refu&s;al, the Electoral Prince, &s;hould &s;et out

<P>We a&s;k, in that ca&s;e,</P>
<P>1. What kind of procuration &s;hould the Elector or the Electoral

<DIV3 TYPE="editor's note">
<P>A copy of the preceding Queries was &s;ent to Bothmar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Bothmar 10. No. 14.</NOTE> at the Hague,
to be communicated to Mr. Cadogan, who was to come to Holland on
a commi&s;&s;ion from the duke of Marlborough; and Bothmar, in a letter to
Robethon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 138.</NOTE> on the 18th and in a po&s;t&s;cript to it on the 25th of March,
gives him Cadogan's and Marlborough's an&s;wer to the&s;e queries.</P>
<P>It was the duke's opinion, that the Elector &s;hould go to England im|mediately,
upon the Queen's death, with full powers from the Electre&s;s,
as her lieutenant general. The Kings of England, he &s;aid, frequently
inve&s;ted lieutenants to govern the kingdom, in their ab&s;ence, with all the
authority and power they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Cadogan thought, that the Electoral Prince &s;hould not go to take the
command of the Engli&s;h troops on the continent; but that Bothmar
&s;hould provi&s;ionally have powers in his hands to authorize the duke of
Marlborough and him&s;elf (Cadogan), to &s;ecure the&s;e troops and the
fortre&s;&s;es they garri&s;on. If the Electre&s;s did not choo&s;e to &s;ign a com|mi&s;&s;ion
of that kind, it would be &s;ufficient to have one &s;igned by the
Elector, in her name. The troops, upon &s;eeing a parchment with the
great &s;eal of his Electoral Highne&s;s would readily obey a man &s;o agree|able
to them as the duke of Marlborough. It was not nece&s;&s;ary to fol|low
<PB N="478" REF="499">
the form u&s;ed in commi&s;&s;ions of that kind in England, nor to write
one in Engli&s;h, The duke of Marlborough's commi&s;&s;ion and his own
were in England, and he could not &s;end copies of them; but it would be
&s;ufficient to &s;ay in the new patent, that he was now inve&s;ted with the
&s;ame powers he had formerly from the Queen.</P>
<P>When the duke of Marlborough was &s;ure of the fidelity of the troops
abroad, he might follow the Elector into England, and leave the Elec|toral
Prince with Cadogan to command the troops.</P>
<P>Cadagon thought it was very nece&s;&s;ary, that he him&s;elf &s;hould have the
commi&s;&s;ion of lieutenant general and governour of the tower, under the
duke of Marlborough or the Electoral Prince. Bothmar, however, was
not thoroughly convinced of that nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Cadogan gave Bothmar the character of &s;ome officers. Colonel Cho|lomondely,
who commanded the &s;econd battalion of Guards, which went
back to England, was attached to the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the two
battalions, officers, and men, might be depended upon. Major general
Sabin who commanded at Ghent, a timid man, but well affected at the
bottom, and might be managed. Brigadier Sutton, who commanded at
Bruges, was entirely dependent on the mini&s;try; but to make amends,
colonel Hill, who commanded the regiment of royal Scots, might be de|pended
on. The commandant at Dunkirk, a Scotchman, and two bat|talions
of that nation, were thorough Jacobites; but the eight Engli&s;h
battalions were well affected, and would give a very good account of the
other two, and of their commandant.</P>

Emperor refu&s;es the&s;e pa&s;&s;ports, the Pretender will go to re&s;ide at the
Abbacy of St. Miel, on the banks of the Mae&s;e, and frontiers of Lorrain.
He has very weak lungs, and will not return to Bar where the air is
too &s;harp for him. He is now at Commercy, and has in his &s;uite, the
earl of Middleton, lord Edward, the &s;on of the duke of Perth, Mr. Strick|land,
Mr. Mac Donald, Mr. Floyd."</P>
<P>"They are &s;o very &s;ilent about every thing done in England, that a gen|tleman,

<P>"Mr. Seldon, formerly governour to the Pretender, having quarrelled

<P>"I Embrace this opportunity of a &s;ecret conveyance, to &s;end you the
an&s;wer to the memorial you &s;ent me &s;ome time ago. This an&s;wer
was drawn up by lord chief ju&s;tice Parker, with the advice of lord
<PB N="482" REF="503">
Somers and lord Cowper. You will find in it a very clear de&s;cription of
all that the Electre&s;s may do, when the event happens.</P>
<P>"I &s;end you likewi&s;e, the form of a commi&s;&s;ion in Latin, for con&s;tituting
the Elector or the Electoral Prince, after the Queen's death, <HI>Cu&s;tos regni</HI>
and ju&s;ticiary of the kingdom, in the name of the Electre&s;s. This com|mi&s;&s;ion
was drawn up by the&s;e three per&s;ons, with great care. There
are, be&s;ides, two other commi&s;&s;ions; one in Latin, for a lord lieutenant
of Ireland, and the other in Engli&s;h, for a captain general, &s;uch as the
Duke of Marlborough has been. I &s;hall &s;end you likewi&s;e, in a few
days, a commi&s;&s;ion of high admiral, and one of lord trea&s;urer; and I
hope that will be &s;ufficient to in&s;truct the court of Hannover, in every
thing they can do, after the Queen's death and before the &s;ucce&s;&s;or ar|rives
here."</P>
<P>"Since it is &s;o difficult for the Elector to contribute to the expence of
the en&s;uing elections, all friends agree to make another propo&s;al to him,
which is of greater con&s;equence, and which appears to them to be ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary. It is to &s;end over the Electoral Prince. It is true, an
invitation by a vote of parliament was formerly &s;poke of; but all friends
are unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that &s;uch an invitation, in the pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion
of affairs, in &s;uch a parliament and under the influence of &s;uch a
mini&s;try, is impracticable."</P>
<P>"They are of opinion, that the Electoral Prince, being a peer of the
realm, and his precedency as a prince of the blood having been regu|lated
by act of parliament, has &s;o many ju&s;t pretexts and rea&s;ons for
coming, that tho&s;e who &s;hould oppo&s;e him, would thereby do them&s;elves
the greate&s;t injury which their greate&s;t enemies could wi&s;h them. If the
Elector will con&s;ent to this point, it will give &s;uch &s;upport to the friends
of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that the other affair of the money will not be nece&s;&s;ary.
This is the unanimous opinion of all friends, and they have charged me
to write it to you."</P>
<P>"We have a fleet of 18 &s;hips of the line ready here. It is not pretended
any longer, that it is for the Baltick. The trea&s;urer &s;aid, three days ago,
that it was intended for an expedition of quite different importance."</P>

<P>"THE following con&s;iderations will po&s;&s;ibly furni&s;h a more clear and
u&s;eful an&s;wer to the queries propo&s;ed, than &s;trictly pur&s;uing the
order of the queries, and breaking that which will be offered, into &s;epa|rate
an&s;wers, to each di&s;tinct particular.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="505">
1. The in&s;trument for nominating lords ju&s;tices ought to be &s;ealed up,
and depo&s;ited with the archbi&s;hop, &amp;c. during her Maje&s;ty's life, or their
validity will be too doubtful to be depended upon: for the in&s;truments
already &s;ealed up and depo&s;ited are effectual appointments of lords ju&s;|tices,
until revoked or altered; and when there is an intention to revoke
or alter them, the Act, page 227, appoints a particular method how
that is to be effected, by three writings, under hand and &s;eal, requiring
them to be delivered up; and till that be done, by the expre&s;s words of
the Act, page 228, the in&s;truments, &s;ealed up and depo&s;ited as afore|&s;aid,
are tho&s;e which are directed to be brought before the privy council,
there to be opened and read, and afterwards to be inrolled in Chancery.
And, therefore, as often as it &s;hall be thought fit to make any alteration
in the three in&s;truments, it ought to be kept in mind, that the alteration
is incompleat, and that nothing is in effect done till the old in&s;truments
are taken up, and the new &s;ealed up, and depo&s;ited in their place; and
that during the Queen's life, in Robethon's hand.</P>
<P>2. In ca&s;e of the demi&s;e of her Maje&s;ty, the regency e&s;tabli&s;hed by the
act of parliament may be entirely aboli&s;hed, by the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, before her
or his arrival in Great Britain. The Kings and Queens of England have,
by the common law, a power to con&s;titute a regency in their ab&s;ence, in
&s;uch manner as is afore-mentioned; and this regency, e&s;tabli&s;hed by this
act, was not intended as any diminution of the royal power, but is merely
provi&s;ional, to prevent an inter-regnum before the &s;ucce&s;&s;or could arrive
in per&s;on, or con&s;titute a regency; and, when either of tho&s;e things hap|pen,
the end de&s;igned by it is fully attained: accordingly by the expre&s;s
words of the Act, in the clau&s;e page 226, which makes the &s;even officers
lords ju&s;tices, they are appointed lords ju&s;tices, and impowered to exe|cute
all acts of government, (no longer than) until &s;uch &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hall
arrive, or otherwi&s;e determine their authority. And by the next clau&s;e,
the per&s;ons nominated in the three in&s;truments are only to be added to
the &s;even, and to act with them as lords ju&s;tices as fully, and in the &s;ame
manner, as if they had been particularly named in the Act; and con&s;e|quently,
their authority will be liable to be determined in the &s;ame man|ner
as the authority of the &s;even who are particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>But whether &s;ome of the regents may be removed from the regency,
after they have once entered upon it, without aboli&s;hing the whole, is
<PB N="485" REF="506">
doubtful. The &s;ucce&s;&s;or's arrival of cour&s;e determines the authority of
them all; and whether the power of determining their authority other|wi&s;e
(as the words of the act run), mean not a like determination of the
authority of them all, is not clear enough to be depended upon in a mat|ter
of this con&s;equence. It is yet more doubtful, whether tho&s;e who are
lords ju&s;tices by virtue of the act, either the &s;even officers, or tho&s;e
named in the three in&s;truments, can act together, with any others to be
added anew to them by the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, after they &s;hall have entered upon
their office.</P>
<P>Therefore, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be thought requi&s;ite to remove any of the
old, or to add any new, the &s;afe&s;t way will be, to determine the whole
regency, and con&s;titute one or more per&s;on or per&s;ons lord ju&s;tice or lords
ju&s;tices, with or without re&s;traints, and with &s;uch directions as &s;hall be
thought fit.</P>
<P>3. The &s;ucce&s;&s;or's power to determine the authority of the lords ju&s;|tices
appointed by the act, before her arrival in Great Britain, &s;uppo&s;es
the power to appoint <HI>a new one or new ones by the common law.</HI> And in
ca&s;e of the demi&s;e of her Maje&s;ty during the life of the Electre&s;s, it is
agreeable to law, and &s;eems in it&s;elf proper and requi&s;ite, that &s;he &s;hould
appoint the Elector, her &s;on, or the Electoral Prince, her grand&s;on, Lord
Ju&s;tice of Great Britain, <HI>Cu&s;tos Regni et Locum tenens,</HI> with power and
directions, in ca&s;e he &s;hall &s;ee it fit and convenient, to di&s;&s;olve and deter|mine
the privy council, and appoint a new one; to di&s;&s;olve the parlia|ment,
and call a new one; to remove all officers, and di&s;po&s;e of all offices
and employments in the di&s;po&s;al of the crown (which will extend to tho&s;e
of the &s;even regents not for life); and to execute and do all other acts of
government in the name and &s;tead of the new &s;ucceeding Queen, as if &s;he
were pre&s;ent in per&s;on. That &s;he may do this, before her arrival in
Great Britain, is plain, becau&s;e it is a proper regal act, often done by
the Kings of England; and the clau&s;e, page 231, which gives force and
effect to &s;uch &s;eal as the &s;ucceeding Queen or King &s;hall make u&s;e of, to
affix to any in&s;trument to execute and do any regal act, proves that &s;uch
&s;ucceeding Queen or King may do regal acts before her or his arrival in
Great Britain. That the privy council may be determined, appears page
225, where it is continued &s;ix months, unle&s;s &s;ooner determined by the
next &s;ucce&s;&s;or.

That all officers, not for life, may be removed, and others put in
their places, appears by the &s;ame clau&s;e; and it is to be noted, that in
that clau&s;e concerning the continuance of officers of the privy council,
all the officers appointed regents, except the archbi&s;hop, and the chief
ju&s;tice, are expre&s;ly named. Therefore, it is to be ob&s;erved, they may
be removed from their offices, though it be doubtful whether they can
be removed from the regency, while it continues; and it &s;eems plain,
that the removal of them from their offices, does not of it&s;elf remove
them from the regency, nor will their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors become lords ju&s;tices,
in virtue of their &s;ucceeding to tho&s;e offices, for the regency is not an|nexed
to their offices to go along therewith; but, page 226, the &s;even
officers after-named, who &s;hall be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their offices at the time
of &s;uch demi&s;e of her Maje&s;ty, are appointed lords ju&s;tices until the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or
&s;hall arrive, or otherwi&s;e determine their authority, where it ap|pears,
that tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ucceed to tho&s;e offices are not within the
words, to be lords ju&s;tices, becau&s;e not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e offices at
the time of the demi&s;e of her Maje&s;ty; and tho&s;e who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
at the time of &s;uch demi&s;e are continued until the &s;ucce&s;&s;or arrive, or
otherwi&s;e determine (not their offices, but) their authority; <HI>i. e.</HI> their au|thority
of lords ju&s;tices.</P>
<P>That the parliament may be di&s;&s;olved, is certain; and may be col|lected
from page 228, where the regents, con&s;tituted lords ju&s;tices by
the act, are re&s;trained from di&s;&s;olving the parliament, without expre&s;s di|rection
from &s;uch &s;ucceeding Queen or King: therefore, by &s;uch direc|tion,
tho&s;e lords ju&s;tices may di&s;&s;olve it; and much more, therefore, may
another lord ju&s;tice, appointed by the &s;ucceeding Queen or King, not
under the re&s;traints laid by the act, upon the provi&s;ional regency.</P>
<P>4. The prince &s;o appointed lord ju&s;tice, <HI>Cu&s;tos regni et locum tenens,</HI>
may, by virtue thereof, take upon him the whole government; and upon
his &s;o doing, and producing his patent, the regency appointed by the act
will be determined. However, it may be proper to have an expre&s;s
clau&s;e for determining the regency in&s;erted in the patent, to prevent all
doubts in that ca&s;e, and nothing more is requi&s;ite to the aboli&s;hing the
regency.</P>
<P>5. The acts done by &s;uch lord ju&s;tice, pur&s;uant to his authority, will,
in law, be the acts of the &s;overeign, however the privy council, the par|liament,
<PB N="487" REF="510">
and officers being appointed, to continue for &s;ome time, unle&s;s
&s;ooner determined, di&s;&s;olved, or removed, by the next &s;ucce&s;&s;or. To
leave no room for doubt, it may be proper to in&s;ert expre&s;s powers and
directions, for the lord ju&s;tice to di&s;&s;olve and determine the privy coun|cil,
to di&s;&s;olve the parliament, and to remove officers if he &s;hall &s;ee fit.</P>
<P>6. The removing of any officers in the di&s;po&s;ition of the crown, and
appointing new ones, is a regal act, which may be done abroad, taking
care to declare of what effect the &s;eal whereby the in&s;trument is &s;ealed
&s;hall be. And as to offices to be executed in Great Britain, the in&s;tru|ment
granting the office, or directing the regents to grant the office, may
be &s;ent over before the next &s;ucce&s;&s;or or the <HI>Cu&s;tos regni</HI> can arrive; con|&s;equently,
a captain general may be abroad appointed to command the
forces abroad, and to &s;ecure their fidelity, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The regency will have power &s;ufficient as to the forces in Great Bri|tain;
but yet the &s;ucce&s;&s;or may appoint a captain general for them too,
if it &s;hall be thought requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>7. A particular power to &s;eize and impri&s;on &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, will be
neither nece&s;&s;ary nor u&s;eful, the ordinary magi&s;trates have &s;ufficient
powers for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>8. It is to be ob&s;erved, once for all, that any dormant in&s;trument for
any of the purpo&s;es afore&s;aid, &s;ealed during her Maje&s;ty's life, will be of
no force by the laws of Great Britain."</P>

<P>"THE friends of the family of Hannover in both hou&s;es of parliamen
affirm, that the trea&s;urer could not have given a more fatal blow to
their influence in the nation, and to the &s;ecurity of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="489" REF="512">
than by making the Queen declare, that a perfect friend&s;hip &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
between the two courts. Halifax, Town&s;hend, Sunderland, So|mers,
Orford, Cowper, and the lord ju&s;tice Parker, con&s;ulted together
for two days; but could not contrive any probable means of preventing
the con&s;equences of the trea&s;urer's de&s;igns. The two fir&s;t lords came
twice to Kreyenberg, in the name of the re&s;t, to repre&s;ent, that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
the Elector &s;hould take &s;ome &s;tep that would undeceive the na|tion.
Kreyenberg propo&s;ed, that they them&s;elves &s;hould make &s;ome
motion in parliament, which they knew the mini&s;try would reject. This
would di&s;cover the in&s;incerity of their prote&s;tations. They an&s;wered,
that the mini&s;try would then repre&s;ent them as &s;editious in the eyes of
the nation, who believed implicitly the Queen's declaration, and as de|&s;igning
to create a mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two courts; and they
gave it as their opinion, that the Electoral Prince &s;hould take advantage
of the Queen's declaration, and come over to England, which would
greatly embarra&s;s the mini&s;try."</P>

<P>"THE Queen's &s;peech, which you have already received, is very art|fully
compo&s;ed to blind the eyes of the people; e&s;pecially the ar|ticle
which in&s;inuates, that there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts a perfect under&s;tanding between
her Maje&s;ty and their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es, as if the Queen did nothing
without con&s;ulting the Elector; when, at the &s;ame time, &s;he has not even
a mini&s;ter at Hannover.</P>
<P>Eight of your principal friends, who dined together on Thur&s;day, at
my lord Halifax's, have given me in charge to tell you, that there will be
no re&s;ource, unle&s;s the Electoral Prince is &s;ent over &s;oon. All the&s;e fine
compliments to the Electoral family, which are contained in the Queen's
&s;peech, and in the addre&s;s of the two hou&s;es, &s;hould encourage your
<PB N="490" REF="513">
court to approve of this journey, and they furni&s;h the mo&s;t natural pre|text
in the world; which is, to come in per&s;on, to acknowledge thank|fully
&s;uch obliging declarations, and pretend to con&s;ider them as very
&s;incere: for it is but ju&s;t to pay the di&s;&s;imulation of the Queen and of
the trea&s;urer in the &s;ame coin. And his Electoral Highne&s;s cannot but
be &s;en&s;ible of the unbecoming manner in which they treat him, by pub|li&s;hing
from the throne, that they do nothing but in concert with him;
while they neglect to give the lea&s;t an&s;wer to the two memorials, pre&s;ented
by the decea&s;ed M. de Grote, concerning the removal of the Pretender
and the pen&s;ion of the Electre&s;s; and while they &s;acrifice entirely, at
Utrecht, the intere&s;ts of his electorate, and of his office as high trea|&s;urer
of the empire.</P>
<P>At any rate, here is the fine&s;t opportunity in the world, to catch lord
Oxford in his own &s;nare. It would &s;eem that Providence pre&s;ents it to
you. For God's &s;ake, do not neglect it; for when you would choo&s;e to
recur to it hereafter, it may be too late.</P>
<P>The prince does not require an order to come here, either the invita|tion
of the parliament, which is not to be expected from a parliament &s;o
ill compo&s;ed as the pre&s;ent, or the permi&s;&s;ion of the Queen, which mo&s;t
a&s;&s;uredly &s;he will not grant, if it is a&s;ked. He is entirely at liberty to
come of his own accord, being naturalized, and being duke of Cam|bridge
and a member in the hou&s;e of peers, and his rank as prince of the
blood being &s;ettled. The Queen her&s;elf cannot forbid him according
to the laws, neither to come into the kingdoms, nor to take his &s;eat in
parliament; and her Maje&s;ty and her mini&s;ters, after &s;uch public and
&s;olemn declarations, which the Queen and the two hou&s;es have lately
made, cannot retract them&s;elves, and will be obliged to receive the prince
well, while every one will turn to him, as to the ri&s;ing &s;un, &s;eeing the
Queen's health is &s;o broken.</P>
<P>My lord Halifax told me, that the friends would by no means pro|po&s;e
in parliament, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome one of the
Electoral family in this country; for that would be que&s;tioning a right,
which your princes have obtained, and give a handle to parliament to
take, in that re&s;pect, &s;ome improper re&s;olution, which might render the
coming of the prince more difficult; neither will they &s;peak of the pen|&s;ion
<PB N="491" REF="514">
for the Electre&s;s; but I believe they will bring the removal of the
Pretender upon the carpet.</P>
<P>The friends are very de&s;irous, that the Elector &s;hould immediately re|&s;olve
to &s;end over the prince, in order that he may arrive during the pre|&s;ent
&s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, which will not continue but two months, and
may take his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of peers, not in order to vote with the
Whigs, and again&s;t the court, but in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what is
due to him; and to convince the nation of the fal&s;ehood of the rumours
they circulated, that the Elector is indifferent about the crown of Eng|land.
For, in other re&s;pects, our friends agree, that the Prince &s;hould
make his court to the Queen, pay attention to the mini&s;ters, care&s;s every
one without di&s;tinction of party, and refrain from coming to the hou&s;e
when party que&s;tions are debated, &s;ince he would be obliged, if he came
on &s;uch occa&s;ions, to vote either again&s;t the court, or again&s;t the friends
of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>That the nation is for the Electoral family, and again&s;t the Pretender,
is evident now to a demon&s;tration, &s;ince the court imagines they cannot
carry the en&s;uing elections, but by means of her Maje&s;ty's declarations
in favour of the family; and the members of the hou&s;e of commons,
that they may be cho&s;en again for the next parliament, cover them&s;elves,
in their addre&s;&s;es, with the &s;ame ma&s;k of a pretended zeal for the pro|te&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion: an example, which will be followed, in all the
addre&s;&s;es that will be pre&s;ented, on the peace, from all parts of the
kingdom.</P>
<P>The lord trea&s;urer publi&s;hes every where in the counties, that his
Electoral Highne&s;s is in perfect concert with the Queen, and will be very
well plea&s;ed, that the members recommended by the court &s;hould be
cho&s;en. This artifice &s;ucceeds to the trea&s;urer's &s;atisfaction in many
places; and as he has, be&s;ides, money to lay out, and is very liberal of
it on &s;uch occa&s;ions; the Whigs are di&s;couraged thereby from offering
them&s;elves to be cho&s;en, from the fear of being di&s;appointed. So that
there is a danger of having a new parliament as devoted to the mini&s;ters
as the pre&s;ent; after which, the&s;e mini&s;ters being ab&s;olute ma&s;ters for
three years, will ea&s;ily accompli&s;h their pernicious de&s;igns, and e&s;tabli&s;h
the Pretender in this country.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="515">
The pre&s;ence of the Electoral Prince in the kingdom,<MILESTONE N="May." UNIT="month"> will be &s;ufficient
to defeat this plan of the mini&s;ters. It will encourage the Whigs to get
them&s;elves cho&s;en, and they will chearfully take upon them&s;elves all the
expence of the elections, without a&s;king any thing from his Electoral
Highne&s;s. The pre&s;ence of the prince will alone have a mighty influence
on the elections, and gain over to the well-affected party an infinite num|ber,
who follow the court only becau&s;e they are not &s;upported by the
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, and are in the mi&s;taken notion of the Elector's neglecting the
affairs of England. All the&s;e fears will vani&s;h. Every one will attach
him&s;elf to the prince, and by that means we &s;hall have a good parlia|ment;
after which, his Electoral Highne&s;s may decide in it as he choo&s;es,
both with regard to the affairs of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and the affairs of Europe.</P>
<P>The &s;ending the Electoral Prince then is an infallible remedy again&s;t
pre&s;ent evils, and again&s;t &s;uch as are dreaded hereafter. It is ea&s;y,
it is natural, it is unexpen&s;ive, and without any ri&s;k in the pre&s;ent con|juncture;
in&s;omuch, that I cannot conceal from you, that if our
friends, who a&s;k it with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;ee they are refu&s;ed, they
will believe them&s;elves ab&s;olutely abandoned, they will hope for no fur|ther
re&s;ource, they will lo&s;e courage, and take their own mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Lord Halifax would have the prince to come po&s;t, with a valet de
chambre and two footmen, under another name, without his order of the
garter, and without liveries, and take his pa&s;&s;age in the pacquet boat,
with a pa&s;&s;port from lord Strafford, procured under a borrowed name.
The re&s;t of his &s;ervants and baggage would follow. In &s;hort, the only
que&s;tion is, to come &s;peedily and &s;ecretly, and every thing will go well."</P>

<P>THE Electoral Prince &s;hould come of his own accord. The pre&s;ent
parliament will never invite him. The Queen will be angry if
they &s;hould force her to invite him; and if the parliament &s;hould reject
a motion of addre&s;&s;ing the Queen to invite him, the prince could not
come again with any propriety; whereas, no one can take it ami&s;s if he
&s;hould come in con&s;equence of the Queen's &s;peech. It is nece&s;&s;ary ei|ther
to &s;end the prince, or to undeceive the nation by a manife&s;to, denying

and the Electoral family. But this la&s;t mea&s;ure will occa&s;ion an open
rupture with the Queen, and may be attended with a thou&s;and incon|veniencies.
"Send over, therefore, the prince: for the &s;afety of Eng|land,
or to &s;peak more properly, of Europe, and your own &s;afety is at

&s;hould not have the liberty of publi&s;hing his opinion; and I imagine that

<P>"LOrd Angle&s;ea is determined to drive the lord Trea&s;urer to extremi|ties,
and has been, for &s;ome time, in &s;trict connection with the
duke of Argyle. This earl is one of the greate&s;t Tories, and is not a
good tempered man. He is very haughty, and very ambitious. He is
one of the mo&s;t active men in the world, and does not deviate an inch
from what he hath once undertaken: and being very clever, there is
rea&s;on to think that the Trea&s;urer will not con&s;ider him as an indifferent
enemy, and that his hatred will give him room for &s;erious reflections.</P>
<P>This nobleman is offended at the haughty manner in which the Trea|&s;urer

of commerce was thrown out, makes him &s;en&s;ible of the danger to which
he is expo&s;ed, and will ha&s;ten the execution of his de&s;ign of bringing
over the Pretender, to which the Queen's &s;tate of health will be a further
inducement. The King of France likewi&s;e is offended for lo&s;ing the

<P>"HIS Electoral Highne&s;s having a&s;&s;ured our friends, by the late
baron de Grote, that he will never abandon them; and that on
the Queen's death, he would do every thing which the nation could ex|pect
from him; and having renewed the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, after the death of
de Grote, by his re&s;ident Kreyenberg, in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t po&s;itive
manner, it would be &s;urpri&s;ing, that they &s;hould doubt of the&s;e a&s;&s;ur|ances
from a prince who is known to be a religious ob&s;erver of his
word.</P>
<P>The Elector does the greate&s;t &s;ervice to the well-affected in England,
which the &s;tate of affairs in Europe in general, and his own particular
&s;ituation will allow, when he engages the Emperor and the Empire to
continue the war again&s;t France, and employs 17,000 of his own troops
again&s;t that kingdom. This puts it out of the King of France's power
to &s;end an army with the Pretender into England, and it is not to be
&s;uppo&s;ed that he will venture to go without a French army, &s;ince he is
pro&s;cribed by the laws, and has the nation again&s;t him. If he does, will
the friends of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, who are &s;o rich, and have &s;o much influ|ence,
and have the nation and the laws on their &s;ide, lo&s;e courage and
&s;ubmit immediately, when their religion, their laws, their property, and
their liberties are at &s;take? e&s;pecially when they are &s;ure of &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
from the Elector. The nation mu&s;t exert it&s;elf, for the Elector
cannot &s;ave them again&s;t their will.</P>
<P>The Elector is at &s;o much expence on the troops he employs on the
Rhine, that he cannot give the money demanded for the elections. Be|&s;ides,
he &s;hould fail infallibly, as the court would always have the hea|vie&s;t
pur&s;e, and &s;uch a mea&s;ure could never be kept &s;o &s;ecret as not to
give great offence to the Engli&s;h mini&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="498" REF="521">
There are &s;everal objections again&s;t &s;ending the Electoral Prince.
There can be no &s;ecurity for a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age. It will be impo&s;&s;ible for
him to go &s;ecretly. The mini&s;try might put ob&s;tacles in his way; and
they might &s;ubject him to mortifications after his arrival. The Elector
has been &s;o often amu&s;ed the&s;e two years, with fal&s;e intelligence of the
Queen's health, that he does not know but her death may be &s;till very
di&s;tant; and it would be imprudent in him, upon an uncertainty, to

<P>"I Had the honour of your letter of the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t. There is no
doubt but that, if the Queen happens to die before the mini&s;ters
here have adju&s;ted their mea&s;ures with France, for bringing over the
prince of Wales, the friends of the family here will have &s;trength enough
to &s;upport their cau&s;e until the Elector arrives, and they are all of opi|nion
that the pre&s;ence of the Elector would be infinitely more u&s;eful
than that of the Electoral Prince, not only in that ca&s;e, but even at this
very time. But as they imagine that the Elector would not choo&s;e to
come before the Queen's death, they propo&s;ed that the Electoral Prince
&s;hould come, as he has &s;uch a ju&s;t pretext for this, which regards him|&s;elf
alone, being a peer of the realm; and they propo&s;e this not only in
view of the Queen's dying &s;oon, for the danger is then by no means &s;o
great, but in order to have a &s;upport, and &s;ome one to counteract the
de&s;igns of the mini&s;try, who will u&s;e the authority of the Queen while
&s;he lives; the admini&s;tration of affairs, which the laws place in their
hands, for concerting &s;uch mea&s;ures with France, that the Pretender will
be here in an in&s;tant, and then it will be too late to prevent him.</P>
<P>All this is &s;o clear to common &s;en&s;e, and mu&s;t be particularly &s;o to
the Elector, who knows better than any one the engagements of the mi|ni&s;try
with France, that it is very &s;urpri&s;ing he &s;hould he&s;itate a mo|ment,
and from any jealou&s;y he may have of the Electoral Prince. If
he will come him&s;elf, as I had often the honour to tell you, all his
friends will rejoice at it more than at the coming of the Electoral Prince.
But if he will neither come him&s;elf nor &s;end the Electoral Prince, I a&s;&s;ure
you that all friends, of all ranks, will con&s;ider them&s;elves as abandoned.
Perhaps this will not be reli&s;hed at Hannover; but I would not be a
faithful &s;ervant to the Elector and to the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, if I did
not acquaint you with the ju&s;t &s;tate of the affair.</P>
<P>We exert our&s;elves more this &s;e&s;&s;ion, and with greater &s;ucce&s;s, than
we had rea&s;on to expect, in hopes that having another parliament, we
&s;hould have &s;ome &s;upport from your court. When it is &s;een that what
<PB N="500" REF="523">
was propo&s;ed, with regard to money, is rejected, and that the Elector will
neither come him&s;elf, nor allow his &s;on to come, we &s;hall become tired,

<P>"AS I am encouraged from your Electoral Highne&s;s to give my opi|nion

<PB N="501" REF="524">
you, that the changes which happened, are founded &s;olely upon the en|mity
of the earl of Oxford again&s;t the duke of Marlborough. To ren|der
that great General u&s;ele&s;s, Oxford advi&s;ed the Queen to fini&s;h the
war, and conclude a peace with France; and, to gain the favour of the
people, he provided for the payment of ten millions of debt, by e&s;ta|bli&s;hing
the South Sea company; gaining, at the &s;ame time, the Clergy
of the church of England, by building fifty new churches, and by other
methods &s;ufficiently known.</P>
<P>He hath likewi&s;e drawn the Jacobites into his party, by conniving at
their hopes and at their views for the Pretender, in order to alarm there|by
your illu&s;trious hou&s;e. But, in my humble opinion, your Electoral
Highne&s;s &s;hould employ all &s;orts of means to engage Oxford and his
friends in your intere&s;ts; promi&s;ing to continue them in their offices, and
to protect them again&s;t Marlborough and his adherents, after the death
of the Queen; for I don't believe that lord Oxford and his friends are
for the Pretender; all he did was from a hatred to Marlborough, and to
revenge him&s;elf of one, who had di&s;graced him with the Queen."</P>
<P>Jacob Mears advi&s;es the Elector to employ &s;ome men of addre&s;s in
England, with powers from him to gain the leaders of the Tories, by
promi&s;es and money, who might ea&s;ily be prevailed upon to abandon the
Pretender, and would then di&s;po&s;e the Queen to be favourable to his
Electoral Highne&s;s. He thinks the Electoral Prince &s;hould go over, and

<P>"LORD Halifax received, with the utmo&s;t gratitude, the compli|ments
and a&s;&s;urances which I gave him from the Elector; declar|ing
to me his willingne&s;s to &s;acrifice his fortune and his life for his
&s;ervice."</P>
<P>Halifax a&s;&s;ured Schutz, that the trea&s;urer endeavours to convince
every one that the Elector approves of all his mea&s;ures: this prevented
the friends of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from oppo&s;ing him; "and if he &s;peaks
in this &s;train, to a nobleman of lord Halifax's capacity, with whom
he pretends to conver&s;e as a friend, and who is con&s;idered to have the
confidence of the Elector, what will he not &s;ay to others, who, he knows,
are not &s;o well informed? The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions of the trea&s;urer's, and the
orders which mon&s;ieur de Grote had, as well as my&s;elf, to &s;ee very few
Whigs, and but rarely and in &s;ecret, will render it very difficult to un|deceive
our friends.</P>
<P>"Lord Halifax believes the Queen, as well as her mini&s;try, is entirely
again&s;t our &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but he is per&s;uaded, that her Maje&s;ty, far from
choo&s;ing to yield the crown to the Pretender in her lifetime, is no ways
di&s;po&s;ed, as yet, to bring him over."</P>
<P>Lord Halifax a&s;&s;ured Schutz, that it was owing to him alone, that the
Treaty of Commerce was rejected: he was the fir&s;t who oppo&s;ed it in the
hou&s;e of peers, and he engaged lord Angle&s;ea and others to oppo&s;e it in
the hou&s;e of commons: "And as he gave me clearly to under&s;tand,
that to &s;acrifice all his fortune, and expo&s;e him&s;elf to the re&s;entment of
France, of the Pretender, and of the Queen's mini&s;try, was playing a
very high game, until one was well a&s;&s;ured that &s;uch a conduct was ap|proved,
could not a letter to him be obtained from the Elector, thank|ing

<P>"I Saw lord Sunderland at Kreyenberg's the day before ye&s;terday. He
does not de&s;pair of the affairs of this country, as many others do.
He thinks the Treaty of Commerce will be rejected, although a better
one will be pre&s;ented to this parliament, than that which was rejected by
the la&s;t. He a&s;&s;ures me the duke of Argyle, who pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days with
him in the country, may be depended upon. He thinks him incapable
of ever reconciling him&s;elf with the mini&s;ter; as he acknowledges now
that he acted formerly on wrong principles, and is di&s;&s;atisfied with his
brother for having &s;huffled, <HI>i. e.</HI> for having paid court to the lord trea|&s;urer,
in hopes that he would have made him one of the 16 Scotch peers.
The misfortune is, that he has thereby neglected to be cho&s;en in oppo|&s;ition
to the court, which the duke thinks he could not have mi&s;&s;ed to
be, if he had &s;poke out, and employed the intere&s;t of his friends in Scot|land.
They &s;ay he is di&s;gu&s;ted at having been played the fool with in

&s;ince it is certain that, of 45 members, there are 34 or 35 Whigs.</P>
<P>Young Mr. Murray, who is known at Hannover, has changed &s;ides,
and is now a &s;py of the lord trea&s;urer's, who detached him to me the day

many other particulars, that he con&s;tantly &s;poke to the Queen about

reports which had been made to her of his conduct, and he entreated her
to let him know what he was accu&s;ed of, that he might exculpate him|&s;elf
by informing her of the truth; but having never been able to ob|tain
that favour, he conjured her to compare the freedom and the bold|ne&s;s,

<P>"LORD Halifax is very happy at the &s;teps which the Queen's mi|ni&s;ters
were obliged to take, at Utrecht, by the bi&s;hop of London.
He hopes it will furni&s;h an opportunity, in the en&s;uing parliament, of
doing &s;omething for the further &s;ecurity of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and for the ad|vantage
of the Electoral family; as he is per&s;uaded, it was unwillingly
the Queen's mini&s;ters took &s;uch a &s;tep. For he believes them di&s;po&s;ed,
from inclination and duty, to favour the Pretender. He flatters him&s;elf
that our affairs are not &s;o de&s;perate as we imagine, and that our enemies
meet with difficulties which we are ignorant of, and which forced them
to &s;uch a mea&s;ure. In &s;hort, he hopes, whether the Pretender &s;tays in
Lorrain or leaves it, that means will be found in the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion of
parliament, to take advantage of this &s;tep again&s;t them.</P>
<P>It was, on this occa&s;ion, the Queen mu&s;t have written to the Pretender

care of them; that it was not yet the time to declare her&s;elf,
and a great deal more in the &s;ame &s;train, and even treating him as a bro|ther.
But as &s;uch a letter mu&s;t have been written very privately, it is
difficult to conceive how any notice could be got of it, and it is nece&s;&s;ary
not to di&s;cover any diffidence of the Queen in that re&s;pect, as the bad

being now returned from England, with an account of the pre&s;ent &s;eitu|ation
of things and di&s;po&s;ion of people's minds there, I thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to take notice in general to you of it, and, at the &s;ame time, ac|quaint

all matters to Mon&s;ieur Bothmar, in order to his tran&s;mitting, in the mo&s;t

I am &s;orry to tell you, grows wor&s;e every day, and will very &s;oon be de&s;|perate,
unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy remedy is applyed. Though the whole con|duct
of our mini&s;try, both as to affaires at home and abroad, leaves no rome
to doubt of their intentions to bring in the Pretender, yet I cannot for|bear
mentioning &s;ome circum&s;tances relating to it, which have happened
&s;ince the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions of parliament: I &s;hall begin with our court's enter|ing
into a &s;tricter and greater union with France than ever, notwith&s;tand|ing
the collu&s;ive maner with which the French King has evaded executing
tho&s;e articles made with England, which were for our advantage; and
as the highe&s;t and mo&s;t convincing mark of the double dealing and per|nicious
de&s;igns of our mini&s;ters; I &s;hall, in the next place, in&s;tance their
affectation of writting to &s;uch princes, not to receive the Pretender, into
whoes countrys they are &s;ure he will never come, and their making
no &s;tep in earned, towardes the removing him out of Lorrain, notwith|&s;tanding
the addre&s;&s;es of both hou&s;es, and that his being there or in France
is the &s;ame thing, by which means, the article in the treaty of peace, for
the &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tant's Succe&s;&s;ion is eluded: to this mu&s;t be
added, the giving all employments, millitary and civil, to notorious Ja|cobits;
the putting the governments of Scotland and Ireland into the hands
of two per&s;ons who are known friends to the Pretender; the choo&s;ing
the 16 lords to &s;erve for Scotland, of which two were with the Preten|der,
la&s;t &s;umer, and mo&s;t of the re&s;t declared Jacobits; the mini&s;ters receiv|ing

of his tran&s;acting the bu&s;ines of Spain, their admitting him intoo their
confidence and privacy, though an Iri&s;h Papi&s;t and an avowed agent of
the Pretender's; the violence and force u&s;ed in the election of members
for the citty of London; the invading the freedome of elections all over
the kingdome, by corruption, opre&s;&s;ion, and bribary, in order to get
&s;uch per&s;ons cho&s;e, as are in the intere&s;t of the Pretender; the animating
the clergy to preach up hereditary and te&s;tamentary right, both which
principles are di&s;tructive to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; the encoraging the publi&s;h|ing
that pernicious book, lately write to &s;upport tho&s;e doctrins, which,
though high trea&s;on by our laws, yet this book which a&s;&s;erts them, was
write, either by direction or conivence of Ld. T. as may be judged by the
following circum&s;tances. Fir&s;t the matterials for it were collect'd either
out of manu&s;cripts in his own library, or out of &s;uch publick recordes
as Mr. Lowndes was known to have been employed in the &s;erch of;
Ld. T&mdash;r, library keeper, corrected the manu&s;cript, and the printing
of the book was publi&s;h'd in the Gazet, and though the printer was ta|ken
up for form's &s;ake, the &s;ale of the book is openly permitted, and
great numbers of them &s;ent gratis all over the kingdome. Many in|&s;tances
of the &s;ame nature might be joyned to the&s;e I have mentioned;
but I think the&s;e more then &s;ufficient to demon&s;trate the views of
the mini&s;try, and the dainger of delaying any longer the entering into ef|fectual
mea&s;ures for the preventing of them. But as this matter is of the
highe&s;t moment, and that the &s;afety of our religon, property and liberty
will depend upon the re&s;olutions to be now taken, our friends in England
&s;ubmit every thing to his Electoral Highne&s;s's great wi&s;dom and
di&s;cretion, and will execute with zeal and plea&s;ure, whatever in&s;truc|tions
or orders he &s;hall plea&s;e to give them in this mo&s;t important affaire.
However, they beleive them&s;elves oblidged, at the &s;ame time, both in
duty to his Electoral Highne&s;s and out of concern for the &s;afety and good
of their country, to repre&s;ent, in the mo&s;t humble and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive maner,
that con&s;idering the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things in England, nothing can &s;o
effectually a&s;&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as his Electoral Highne&s;s going there;
or, if that can not be hoped for, the &s;ending the prince, which would
animate and encorage, to the greate&s;t degree, all tho&s;e of both partys,
who wi&s;h well to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and break the mea&s;ures of tho&s;e who

are again&s;t it.<MILESTONE N="December." UNIT="month"> But, though this is the unanimous, &s;en&s;e of our friends in
England, yet they leave and wholly &s;ubmit it to his Electorale Highne&s;s
prudence and judgement, and de&s;ire that this their advice may be under&s;tood
to proceed from hearts ful of affection and unalterable attachement to his
Electoral Highne&s;s per&s;on and intere&s;ts; for the promoting of which
they will be allways ready to venture their lives and fortunes. As I write
you this, in the la&s;t confidence, I de&s;ire it may be comunicated only
to his Electoral Highne&s;s and Mon&s;ieur Bern&s;torf, and for fear of acce|dents,
you will be plea&s;ed afterwards to burn it. I am with truth, yours."</P>

<P>CADOGAN was at the Hague, and gave to Bothmar a memorial con|cerning
the &s;tate of affairs in England, and the means of retrieving
them. It was to be &s;ent to the Elector, and drawn up in &s;uch a way, that
it might be communicated to the well affected Tories: but he mentioned
&s;everal other particulars to Bothmar, which the latter writes to his corre|&s;pondent
in this letter. The Elector &s;hould a&s;&s;ure the Tories, that the
Whigs would re&s;ign to them offices and employments. If the Electoral
Prince would go to England, there were 50 or 60 great men who would
hazard their fortunes and their lives to &s;erve him. If the Elector him|&s;elf
would go, they would furni&s;h him any &s;ums of money that he &s;hould
judge nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of his de&s;igns. A proof of the po&s;&s;i|bility
of this was, that eight or ten per&s;ons were able to furni&s;h the Em|peror
<PB N="520" REF="543">
with three millions. They would furni&s;h money much more rea|dily
for the pre&s;ervation of their own country.</P>
<P>They again entreated his Electoral Highne&s;s very earne&s;tly to grant
the pen&s;ions they a&s;k for &s;ome poor lords, who want nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence;
and if they cannot engage his Electoral Highne&s;s to agree to any thing
they propo&s;e, they will endeavour to provide for them&s;elves as well as
they can, and yield to the times. "He told me, that the dutche&s;s of
Marlborough was to return to England in &s;pring, and that perhaps the
duke would do &s;o likewi&s;e; for being now 66 years of age, it was proper
for him to think of dying in peace in his native country, if he could. If
we will do nothing our&s;elves to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, we cannot expect it
without a miracle. I am afraid we will not get off with the lo&s;s of our
hopes of that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and that &s;o much trouble will be given to us,
and &s;o many enemies rai&s;ed again&s;t us el&s;ewhere, that we will not be either
in peace or &s;afety in the Electorate, until we &s;hall be &s;o low, that they
may be a&s;&s;ured they have nothing further to apprehend from us."</P>
<P>"You recollect, that both the duke of Marlborough and Cadogan
have provi&s;ional orders from the Electre&s;s to take the command of the
troops and of garri&s;ons in ca&s;e of the Queen's death. Cadogan told me,
it would be proper to have a particular one for Mr. Arm&s;trong quarter-ma&s;ter
general, who commands at Dunkirk, to &s;eize upon that place,
and execute the orders of Marlborough or Cadogan. That order may
remain in the duke of Marlborough's hands, until it will be time to ex|ecute
it; which Cadogan an&s;wers Arm&s;trong will do, although the mi|ni&s;try
confide in him. He is a creature of Cadogan's, who knows, that
according to the laws &s;uch orders are not valid; but he &s;ays, that officers
and &s;oldiers, &s;o very well affected as they are, will not examine the point
&s;o narrowly, and will be &s;atisfied with &s;eeing the name and the &s;eal of the
Electre&s;s; and when once the thing is done, rea&s;ons will be ea&s;ily found
afterwards to ju&s;tify it."</P>

<P>The Pretender, having retired from the dominions of France, before

Queen, to u&s;e her influence with the princes in alliance with Great Bri|tain,
not to receive him into their dominions. The&s;e princes, how|ever,
were no &s;trangers to the circum&s;tance, that the Queen, and even
&s;ome of her &s;ervants, de&s;ired that he &s;hould not be mole&s;ted. She her|&s;elf

<P>"IN an&s;wer to the letter, with which I have been honoured from your
Royal Highne&s;s, concerning the de&s;igns of the Chevalier de St.
George to be allied to the family of Au&s;tria, I &s;hall tell you that I have
communicated them to the prince of Trau&s;ton, who willingly undertook
the commi&s;&s;ion to the Emperor, and even gave me rea&s;on to expect a
&s;peedy an&s;wer, which I have waited for from day to day; but your Royal
Highne&s;s knows, that they are not as expeditious, at this court, as one
could wi&s;h. Accordingly I have not been able to obtain an an&s;wer until
la&s;t night, when the prince &s;ent for me very late to tell me, that he had
given an account to the Emperor of what I had &s;aid to him concerning
the Chevalier de St. George; that his Maje&s;ty had appeared to reli&s;h the
propo&s;al, but found the pre&s;ent times too critical to be able to come to
a determination; adding, that he did not believe that it was the intere&s;t
of the Chevalier de St. George to determine any thing po&s;itively, in the
pre&s;ent conjuncture, and that he was di&s;po&s;ed to give the Chevalier
marks of e&s;teem and regard when the occa&s;ions offered. This, in a few
words, is the an&s;wer that was made to me. I remarked, however, in con|tinuing
the conver&s;ation with the prince of Trau&s;ton, that, far from being
aver&s;e from this alliance, they would de&s;ire it much; e&s;pecially if the
Chevalier de St. George was re&s;tored to his dominions, as it is not doubted
will happen in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>This mini&s;ter found, that there was a di&s;proportion of age, between
the Chevalier de St. George and the younge&s;t of the archdutche&s;&s;es, niece
to the reigning Emperor; and that they would be more inclined to &s;ettle
the younge&s;t of the archdutche&s;&s;es, his &s;i&s;ter, the fir&s;t being only twelve;
and the la&s;t two and twenty years old; and it is believed here, that the
Chevalier de St. George is twenty-five. The mini&s;ter &s;trictly enjoined me
<PB N="524" REF="547">
to write to your Royal Highne&s;s,<MILESTONE N="March." UNIT="month"> that you ought to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t
profound &s;ecrecy in this affair; that the pre&s;ent conjuncture requires this,
on your own account, and on account of the Emperor and of the Cheva|lier

written to you concerning the de&s;igns of the Chevalier de St. George, with
regard to the alliance he would choo&s;e to form with the family of Au|&s;tria.
The rea&s;on of my delay has been, that I could not till now find
an opportunity of giving information to the Chevalier de St. George,
who appeared to me to be very &s;en&s;ible of the marks of regard and e&s;teem
which the Emperor has &s;hewn him; and he has given me in charge to
write to you about this, in order that by my orders you might &s;how that

George would have wi&s;hed that he him&s;elf could have written to the Em|peror,
to &s;hew his gratitude; but that he did not believe it became him

no other rea&s;on but pure curio&s;ity, if the Emperor would receive or an|&s;wer
a letter from the Chevalier de St. George, and write to him as
King.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you, that I had for a long time the curio&s;ity to a&s;k you,

<P>"I Would very much have wi&s;hed not to have been obliged, at this
time, to enter upon &s;o nice a &s;ubject as that of religion; but your
two la&s;t letters are &s;o pre&s;&s;ing and po&s;itive, that it would be an unpar|donable
di&s;&s;imulation in me, &s;hould I not an&s;wer your letters, with the
&s;ame &s;incerity you write them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, begin by putting you in mind of the la&s;t conver&s;a|tion
I had with you upon that &s;ubject, to which I have nothing to add,
but that I neither want coun&s;el nor advice to remain unalterable in my
fixt re&s;olution, of never di&s;&s;embling my religion; but rather to abandon
all than act again&s;t my con&s;cience and honour, co&s;t what it will. The&s;e
are my &s;entiments; and, had I others, or &s;hould I act contrary to tho&s;e I
have, where is the man of honour that would tru&s;t me? and how could
ever my &s;ubjects depend upon me, or be happy under me, if I &s;hould
make u&s;e of &s;uch a notorious hypocri&s;y to get my&s;elf among&s;t them? I
<PB N="526" REF="549">
know their generous character could not but dete&s;t both the crime it&s;elf
and him that &s;hould be guilty of it. And would they but give them|&s;elves
time &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, I am per&s;uaded they would not make
my religion the only ob&s;tacle to my re&s;toration; it being it&s;elf the great|e&s;t
&s;ecurity for their liberties, properties, and religion, by putting it out
of my power ever to invade them &s;hould I intend it; which is &s;o far
from my thoughts, that, on the contrary, I am mo&s;t willing and ready
to grant all the rea&s;onable &s;ecurity that can be demanded of me, in rela|tion
to all the&s;e points, all my de&s;ire being to make them a &s;louri&s;hing
and happy people.</P>
<P>I can have no other intere&s;t but theirs; whereas, how many other
rightful heirs are there to the crown after me, who being powerful fo|reigners,
may have inclinations equal to their power, and may very pro|bably
never give re&s;t to England, till they en&s;lave it in good earne&s;t?</P>
<P>Will my &s;ubjects be always &s;o blinded, as to make a mon&s;ter of what
is in effect their greate&s;t &s;ecurity; and not perceive and endeavour to
prevent the real and ju&s;t cau&s;es they have of fear and apprehen&s;ion?</P>
<P>My pre&s;ent &s;incerity, at a time it may co&s;t me &s;o dear, ought to be
a &s;ufficient earne&s;t to them of my religious ob&s;ervance of whatever I
promi&s;e them: for I can &s;ay, with truth, that I heartily abhor all di&s;&s;i|mulation
and double dealing, and I love my &s;ubjects even now too well
not to wi&s;h, as much for their &s;akes as my own, that they would at lea&s;t
open their eyes to &s;ee their true intere&s;t, and timely provide for their fu|ture
peace and quiet.</P>
<P>I know my grandfather and father too had always a good opinion of
the principles of the church of England, relating to monarchy; and ex|perience
&s;ufficiently &s;heweth, that the crown was never &s;truck at but &s;he
al&s;o felt the blow: and, though &s;ome of her chief profe&s;&s;ors have failed
in their duty, we mu&s;t not mea&s;ure the principles of a church by the

<P>"THIS moment Mr. Strickland is arrived with the letter, which you
did me the honour to write to me. Behold then, at la&s;t, the pe|riod
arrived which mu&s;t decide your fortune! You have taken the only
proper cour&s;e, by going to Paris; and I hope that you will find at the
court of France the &s;uccours which are nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;s
of your enterpri&s;e. The honour which you did me, Sir, during your
&s;tay in my dominions, and the liberty with which you allowed me to tell
you my &s;entiments, induce me to entreat you now to remember, that by
the death of Queen Anne, France is free of all engagements with Eng|land;
tho&s;e which had been contracted by the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King hav|ing
been only with the Queen per&s;onally, and not with the Engli&s;h
nation. This leaves France without any engagement, and in a &s;ituation
to &s;upport you without any reproach. But, Sir, this &s;upport, when too
public, may not be advantageous to you; and in my opinion, as I have
had the honour of repre&s;enting to you &s;everal times already, the mo&s;t
e&s;&s;ential &s;uccours are, not to allow you to want money, to &s;ecure your
pa&s;&s;age by &s;ome &s;hips, and to permit you to take along with you the na|tional
troops, which would not alarm any one in England; whereas
French troops certainly would.</P>
<P>Some arms and ammunition will be no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; ammunition
may be ea&s;ily found at Calais, and for fear of lo&s;ing time, arms may be
taken from the troops which work at the new harbour near Dunkirk; for
they may make &s;ome difficulties about the time which will be nece&s;&s;ary
for furni&s;hing the&s;e things. If the duke of Berwick, as you believed,
was not de&s;irous of attending you, he has &s;ucceeded: but, Sir, I entreat
you to remember that a good officer, who is not a &s;tranger, is nece&s;&s;ary
for you. I have no doubts but you will land in Scotland; it is upon
that kingdom, it appears to me, you ought principally to depend. You
will probably find there a greater number of friends; and be&s;ides, it is a
country in which you can better maintain your ground. The di&s;union of
<PB N="528" REF="551">
that kingdom is the mea&s;ure, which will attach them mo&s;t to you. For|give
me, Sir, this detail; but amid&s;t the great occupations, in which
you are engaged, you may not perhaps recollect this, of which, how|ever,
you your&s;elf are convinced. My zeal makes me take too much
liberty, which you will be plea&s;ed to excu&s;e; as well as any omi&s;&s;ion I
may have been guilty of, during your &s;tay in this country. I can do
nothing now, but pray God to ble&s;s your undertaking, and to pre&s;erve
your health; be&s;eeching you, Sir, to grant me your protection, and to
be per&s;uaded of my zeal, which will not cea&s;e but with my life.</P>

rea&s;ons of the Earl of Oxford's quarrel with the duke of Ormond.&mdash;The
Duke of Marlborough and Lord Bolingbroke were always friends.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"L. L. on the 28th of June, 1725, told me, that Mr. Harley, at the
time he was bringing about the change in the mini&s;try, in 1710,
was near quarrelling with lord Harcourt and Bolingbroke. He had a
mind to fix them in their old po&s;ts of &s;ecretary of war and attorney-gene|ral.
But the one in&s;i&s;ted on being lord chancellor, and the other &s;ecre|tary
of &s;tate; which he refu&s;ing to agree to, they came to L. L. and told
him the ca&s;e, and that there was no doing any thing with him, and there|fore,
they determined to go, the one into Oxford&s;hire and the other into
Berk&s;hire, next morning; and as he was to &s;tay in town, they begged of
him to &s;hew him&s;elf cool and re&s;erved to him. L. L. &s;aid, he was &s;orry
for the occa&s;ion of their going; but he would not quarrel with an old
friend without rea&s;on. They &s;aid, all that they de&s;ired of him was, to
&s;hew him&s;elf cool to Mr. Harley, which he determined to do. After they
were gone, lord L. wrote a letter to Mr. Harley, acquainting him with
Harcourt and Bolingbroke's being with him and their re&s;olution; and
told him very plainly, that if he went on at this rate, he would lo&s;e all his
friends, and nobody would have any thing to do with him; repre&s;ented
the con&s;equences and de&s;ired him to con&s;ider them. He left a copy of
this letter in England. Harley and Bolingbroke, after parting with L. L.
had gone to Mr. Harley's, and this letter was delivered to Mr. Harley,
whil&s;t they were with him, and they &s;aw the &s;uper&s;cription to be
lord L's hand. Bolingbroke a&s;ked L. L. afterwards, what was in the
letter; for, he &s;aid, he never &s;aw a man &s;o &s;truck, in his life time, as
Harley was after reading it. The i&s;&s;ue was, Harcourt and Bolingbroke
were &s;atisfied, and &s;taid in town.</P>
<P>Harley u&s;ed often to complain to lord L. of the Tories having been
cut out of bu&s;ine&s;s for above twenty years, and of their unfitne&s;s for it;
and had, therefore, a mind to bring over a capable Whig or two. But
the lea&s;t motion of it put the Tories in a &s;lame, and he could not do it.</P>
<P>Harcourt had complained often, in very feeling terms, to lord L. that
he knew no more of the mea&s;ures of the court, though he was L. C. than
<PB N="532" REF="555">
his footman. That lord Bolingbroke had not made him a vi&s;it of a
year, and lord Oxford did not &s;o much as know him. But ju&s;t before
the Queen died, Bolingbroke brought him into his mea&s;ures, and they
were entire confidents.</P>
<P>Oxford and Bolingbroke had always been pu&s;hing one another, from
the very time of their power, and labouring to &s;upplant each other.
Lord Oxford told L. L. upon a&s;king when he had &s;een Harry St. John,
and L. L. an&s;wering, that Harry was a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, and he had not
&s;een him of a long while, that Bolingbroke was betraying all their coun|&s;els
to lord Marlborough; and that he owed the finding out of the &s;ecret
to little Dartmouth, and Era&s;mus Lewis had made the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>It is certain, lord Marlborough was very fond always of Harry St.
John; and, on the lo&s;s of his &s;on, the lord Blandford, &s;aid he had no
comfort le&s;t, but in Harry St. John, whom he loved and con&s;idered as
his &s;on: and, notwith&s;tanding the difference, on account of Party,
the duke always had a regard for him.</P>
<P>Bolingbroke, in the mid&s;t of his &s;truggle with lord Oxford, was hated
mortally by lady Ma&s;ham and abominated by the Queen, for his loo&s;e
life, and Oxford was in the height of his credit; &s;o that he mu&s;t have
fallen, if he had not been nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;cheme of the peace, he
being the only man about court that could &s;peak French, or tran&s;act any
thing with Me&s;nager or the other per&s;ons &s;ent over by the court of
France, or to be &s;ent into France.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, or a little after the fir&s;t overtures of peace, the
Quebec expedition was &s;et on foot, in which lord Oxford refu&s;ed to gra|tify
Mrs. Ma&s;ham, in an affair relating to it, by which &s;he would have
got a good &s;um of money. She, though his relation, re&s;ented this high|ly.
Bolingbroke improved the moment, &s;truck in with her and told her,
he would get it done, in &s;pite of lord Oxford. He did &s;o; and &s;he &s;tood
by him afterwards.</P>
<P>Lord Oxford, who was for &s;erving the King<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This &s;eems to be a mi&s;take.</NOTE>, fancied Bolingbroke was
engaged in that &s;cheme; and therefore, thought to &s;trike in with the H.
of H. This completed his ruin; and he was mi&s;taken in his point: for
Bolingbroke's view was the H. of H. and the night after lord Oxford
was out, L. L. came to Ken&s;ington, to get the Queen to &s;ign &s;ome papers,
<PB N="533" REF="556">
which he deferred upon the dutche&s;s of Ormond, (who was then in waiting)
her telling, that the Queen was &s;omething indi&s;po&s;ed; but &s;he would
acquaint her, if his lord&s;hip plea&s;ed. But, he &s;aid, it was no matter of
con&s;equence, and he would not di&s;turb her. He &s;aw there waiting for
lord Bolingbroke, who failed them, Charles Cae&s;ar, John Drummond,
&amp;c. John was to part in a day's time, for Holland, to engage lord Albe|marle
to negociate for them, with the court of Hannover; and the&s;e and
others then in waiting, as John Drummond him&s;elf told L. L. were
all in that &s;cheme. The earl's death blew up this affair; that mini&s;try
la&s;ting only three days, and the hou&s;e of Hannover not &s;en&s;ible of their
obligation to them.</P>
<P>Lord Marlborough landing, as it were, the moment of the Queen's
death, I was apt to fancy, he might be in that &s;cheme; but L. L. &s;aid,
he did not believe it; and he heard lord Bolingbroke, in company with
him&s;elf, lord Bath, and others, on the day of the duke's entry into Lon|don,
&s;peak with a violent re&s;entment upon it, and &s;ay, He ought to be
&s;ent to the Tower for it.</P>
<P>December the 13th, Mrs. A. O. told me, that lord Oxford oppo&s;ed
the duke of Ormond's li&s;t of new officers for the army, becau&s;e it was com|po&s;ed
of Bagnals, Mathews, and other Iri&s;h, and becau&s;e the duke of
Ormond in&s;i&s;ted, that the officers turned out &s;hould be paid for their re|giments
and po&s;ts which they had purcha&s;ed with their blood, which the
new officers propo&s;ed were not able to do; nor could the Exchequer
then &s;upply 50,000 <HI>l.</HI> which was the lea&s;t it amounted to. That,
upon lady Ma&s;ham's quarrel with lord Oxford, about her &s;hare in the
10 per cent. re&s;erved out of the A&s;&s;iento contract, which was intended to
be &s;hared between her, &amp;c. She &s;ent for A O. to apply to the duke of
Ormond; who &s;aid, &s;he could not pretend to have &s;o much credit with
the duke, though perhaps her mother might. That her mother was &s;ent
for, and &s;he (A. O.) went to Sir John Stapleton's, where the duke was to
&s;up, fetched him away to Ken&s;ington, where lady Ma&s;ham told him how
ill the Queen was, and how unea&s;y at nothing being done for her brother;
and that, if he would but &s;ecure her 30,000 <HI>l.</HI> of the ten per cent, which
amounted to 100,000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;he would join with him, and he &s;hould have the
modelling of the army, &amp;c. as he plea&s;ed. He was afterwards introduced
to the Queen, who was ill, (this was the year before her death) in order
<PB N="534" REF="557">
to offer his &s;ervice to &s;erve her brother, and have the modelling of the
army, &amp;c. granted him: but in&s;tead of giving any a&s;&s;urances or making
any propo&s;als to the Queen, who was prepared to grant him every thing;
he only a&s;ked her, if &s;he had any commands for him, and went away with|out
&s;aying more.</P>
<P>The duke of Ormond took it ill of lord Oxford, that when he de&s;ired
1200 <HI>l.</HI> a year pen&s;ion might be &s;ettled on lady Hales, lord Oxford pro|po&s;ed
to make the duke's own pen&s;ion 6000 <HI>l.</HI> in&s;tead of 5000 a year, and
offered to get it done, and then the duke might give her as much on his
own e&s;tate: but lady Hales piqued her&s;elf on having a pen&s;ion from the
Queen; and made the duke refu&s;e the offer and quarrel with lord Ox|ford,
who would not grant the 1200 <HI>l.</HI> a year pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>When lord Oxford was turned out, Bolingbroke's &s;cheme and Har|court's
was for the hou&s;e of Hannover, to make the duke of Marlborough
general, and if the duke of Ormond &s;ubmitted to it, to allow him the po&s;t
of lord-lieutenant of Ireland; if not, to turn him out of all, and &s;light him."</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1714" UNIT="year"> THOUGH the Tories were generally deemed Jacobites, by the
hou&s;e of Hannover, there is no rea&s;on to believe, that the whole
of that party were friends to the Pretender. The bigotry of that prince,
in adhering, with &s;uch ob&s;tinacy, to the Romi&s;h faith, cooled the zeal of
tho&s;e who were mo&s;t attached to the line of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Be|&s;ides,
many Tory leaders, di&s;appointed in their own views upon office, and
offended, upon that account, with the lord trea&s;urer, began to cabal with
the Whigs. Among the&s;e was the earl of Angle&s;ea, a man of quick
parts, but revengeful in his di&s;po&s;ition. This earl, together with Sir Wil|liam
Dawes, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of arch-bi&s;hop Sharpe, in the &s;ee of York, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
great influence with the Tories. On the 5th of April, in the pre|&s;ent
year, they joined them&s;elves to the Whigs; when, upon a divi&s;ion
in the hou&s;e of lords, the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was, by a &s;mall majority,
voted out of danger. They were followed by the whole bench of bi|&s;hops,
by the earls of Abingdon and Jer&s;ey, the lords A&s;hburnham and
Carteret, and &s;ome other temporal peers of the High Church party.
Their principles, however, were not the &s;ole motives of this de&s;ertion.
The means by which Angle&s;ea, the arch-bi&s;hop, and their friend Sir Tho|mas
Hanmer, were gained to the hou&s;e of Hannover, are explained, upon
more &s;olid grounds, in the following papers.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the votes in parliament, the &s;ecurity of laws which
had never been infringed, and the manife&s;t attachment of a great majority
of the nation, the family of Hannover, mi&s;led by the ignorance of their
agents and the violence of the Whigs, continued to think, that their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
to the throne was in the utmo&s;t danger. The Elector him&s;elf,
hara&s;&s;ed and fatigued, by the eagerne&s;s of his agents, and the vehement
<PB N="536" REF="559">
remon&s;trances of tho&s;e who called them&s;elves his friends, had become ex|tremely
indifferent, about a throne &s;o difficult to mount. He had, du|ring
the whole cour&s;e of the preceding year, declined to gratify the
Whigs, in &s;ending over the Electoral Prince. He refu&s;ed to &s;atisfy
either their avarice or their wants with pen&s;ions. He would not give them
money to influence the general elections in their favour. He rejected
their violent propo&s;al of invading the kingdom with an army. Having
failed to awaken the ambition of his Highne&s;s, they applied them&s;elves
to his humanity and his fears. They repre&s;ented, that their liberties,
their fortunes, and, perhaps, their lives were in the utmo&s;t danger, &s;hould
the Pretender &s;ucceed to the throne. They in&s;inuated, that neither the
Elector him&s;elf nor his family could be &s;afe, upon that event, in the
heart of Germany: that a prince, who con&s;idered them as rivals in the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would never &s;it down contented, till he had reduced them &s;o
low, as to cea&s;e to be an object of terror. This la&s;t con&s;ideration had,
at length, &s;uch an effect upon his Highne&s;s, that he permitted his envoy
in London to demand a writ of &s;ummons to the Electoral Prince, as duke
of Cambridge; a tran&s;action that made a great noi&s;e at the time, and is
fully explained in the following papers.</P>
<P>The attention of the people having been gradually rai&s;ed by this and
&s;imilar circum&s;tances, the Queen and her &s;ervants found it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to concur, at la&s;t, in appearance, with the &s;entiments of the na|tion.
They had hitherto &s;ucceeded, notwith&s;tanding the arts of the
Whigs, in e&s;tabli&s;hing a general opinion, that a perfect harmony &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
between the courts of Great Britain and Hannover. Whatever af|fection
the Queen might have had for her brother, a great part of it was
obliterated, by his bigotted attachment to a &s;y&s;tem of religion which &s;he
abhorred. She, however, &s;ecretly wi&s;hed that he might &s;ucceed her in
the throne. But her &s;ervants would be extremely willing to retain their
power, by gaining the good graces of the hou&s;e of Hannover<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>"A fooli&s;h circum&s;tance which rendered ineffectual all endeavours of the late mini&s;try to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in the good graces of the court of Hannover, as I &s;hall par|ticularly relate in another work.

&s;ent Mr. Harley, this year, to Hannover, to inquire what further
&s;ecurities the Elector thought nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his family to
the throne. She offered to concur in whatever he &s;hould demand, ex|cepting
the &s;ending over a prince of his family to re&s;ide in the kingdom.
This, &s;he thought, was the &s;ame thing as to de&s;cend from the throne. She
and her mini&s;ters were much blamed by the Whigs, for refu&s;ing to invite
the Electoral prince. That party had forgot that they them&s;elves had
been equally aver&s;e from &s;uch an invitation, when they were in power<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>"For my own part, I freely told my opinion to the mini&s;ters, and did, after|wards, offer many rea&s;ons for it, in a di&s;cour&s;e intended for the public (but &s;topped by the Queen's death.) That the young grand&s;on, who&s;e name I cannot remember, &s;hould be invited over to be educated in England; by which, I conceived the Queen might be &s;ecure from the influence of cabals and factions. The zealots, who affected to believe the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in danger, could have no pretences to complain; and the nation might one day hope to be governed by a prince of Engli&s;h manners and language."</Q> <BIBL>Swift's Enquiry.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>The lord trea&s;urer, while a commoner, and &s;peaker of the hou&s;e, voted
for all the acts that were pa&s;&s;ed in different &s;e&s;&s;ions of parliament, for &s;et|tling
and &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line. Notwith&s;tanding
what has been &s;uppo&s;ed by the court of Hannover, and a&s;&s;erted, with
uniform vehemence, by the Whigs, no deci&s;ive proofs can be advanced,
that he ever favoured the Pretender, during the four years of his admini|&s;tration.
In the two la&s;t years, when he found him&s;elf declining in the
Queen's favour, and felt a con&s;equent diminution of his influence in the
cabinet, he made all advances to the court of Hannover, con&s;i&s;tent with
the aukwardne&s;s of his manner, the re&s;erve of his temper, and that af|fectation
of &s;ecrecy and de&s;ign, which he thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for
a mini&s;ter, and which he probably u&s;ed to conceal his own want of exten|&s;ive
talents. A di&s;cerning reader will perceive, even through the com|plaints
and prejudices of the Hannoverian agents, that this unfortunate
man wi&s;hed &s;incerely to &s;ecure a retreat for him&s;elf, behind the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
in the prote&s;tant line. He paid no court to the Jacobites and high Tories,
<PB N="538" REF="561">
that was not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for continuing him&s;elf in office. Boling|broke
was the principal advi&s;er of all the violent mea&s;ures which contri|buted
to increa&s;e the terrors of the Whigs, and to continue the &s;u&s;picions
of the hou&s;e of Hannover.</P>
<P>The apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e who were, or pretended to be, well-affected
to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hannover, were not entirely groundle&s;s.
The jealou&s;y of the Electoral family could not altogether have proceeded
from the inventions of faction, the mi&s;repre&s;entations of party, or the ig|norance
or blind zeal of their agents in London. Though Queen Anne
was, perhaps, conveniently free from &s;trong attachments of any kind,
though &s;he was actually too dilatory and unenterpri&s;ing in her nature, and
timid in her di&s;po&s;ition, to engage in any dangerous undertaking; though
&s;he was probably as aver&s;e from bringing over the Pretender, during her
life, as &s;he was from &s;eeing a prince of the Electoral family re&s;iding in
the kingdom; yet it can be now no que&s;tion, but towards the end of her
reign, &s;he was favourably di&s;po&s;ed towards her brother, and would have
been well plea&s;ed, without any trouble or danger to her&s;elf, to have &s;e|cured
for him the eventual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the throne. He him&s;elf was no
&s;tranger to this circum&s;tance, and he formed his expectations accordingly.
In a declaration, publi&s;hed immediately upon her demi&s;e, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Of
her good intentions towards us, we could not, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, well
doubt; and this was the rea&s;on we then &s;at &s;till, expecting the good ef|fects
thereof, which were unfortunately prevented by her deplorable
death."</Q></P>
<P>The court of Hannover, though the &s;u&s;picions of their agents were
greater than the truth, could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;trangers to the Queen's inten|tions.
Notwith&s;tanding all the kind a&s;&s;urances and prote&s;tations of friend|&s;hip
received from Anne, it was natural for them to &s;u&s;pect her &s;incerity,
when they &s;aw that all the avowed friends of the Pretender &s;upported all
her mea&s;ures. The character and manner of her mini&s;ter were calculated
to increa&s;e the &s;u&s;picions of the Electoral family. With &s;ome abilities,
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the weakne&s;&s;es, and even &s;tooped to the meanne&s;&s;es in
which the whole art of every &s;hallow politician con&s;i&s;ts. Regardle&s;s of
&s;incerity, in his political conduct, he often promi&s;ed more than he had
either power or inclination to perform. Flying perpetually from the
<PB N="539" REF="562">
point, in his conver&s;ation upon bu&s;ine&s;s, he di&s;gu&s;ted mankind in general,
in proportion to the eagerne&s;s which men entertain concerning their own
affairs. It was only when he meant not to adhere to his word, he gave
any an&s;wer at all; and that was even then contrived in a way that ren|dered
it ambiguous. There was an air of &s;ecrecy in all his manner,
and vi&s;ible in every feature of his countenance, and an affectation of my&s;|tery
and deep de&s;ign, even in trifles. This defect in his character was &s;o
little calculated to gain the confidence of others, that it actually expo&s;ed
him&s;elf to &s;u&s;picions, when in reality he might have no bad de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The repeated charges brought again&s;t the earl of Oxford, in the Han|nover
papers, may be ju&s;tified by the defects of his own manner and mind.
But his colleagues in office, e&s;pecially the vi&s;count Bolingbroke, were
more &s;anguine in their temper and determined in their mea&s;ures, An
inveteracy, ari&s;ing from mutual injuries, had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them and
the Whigs for &s;everal years. It was fore&s;een, that an univer&s;al change of
men and mea&s;ures would take place, upon the demi&s;e of the Queen: that
the Electoral family would employ the Whigs in the admini&s;tration of
their affairs, whenever they mould &s;ucceed to the crown: that the Tories
would be humbled, and tho&s;e at pre&s;ent in office be in danger of their
lives and fortunes. It was, therefore, natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that men in
&s;uch circum&s;tances had entered into &s;ecret mea&s;ures to form a &s;helter for
them&s;elves, again&s;t the &s;torm which was gathering over their heads. Their
common prudence, if not their principles, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to direct
their views to the Pretender. But, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e appearances,
there is rea&s;on to believe that, had the Queen lived for &s;ome time longer,
even Bolingbroke would have found means to reconcile him&s;elf to the
hou&s;e of Hannover; having held an uninterrupted communication with
the duke of Maryborough, who was much more attached to the re|covery
of his own power, than to either of the rivals for the Briti&s;h
throne.</P>

<P>"LORD Stair told me, that lord Mar came to tell him, in a friendly
manner, that it was intended to make &s;ome changes among the
officers; and that he being one of tho&s;e they wanted to remove, he was
willing to a&s;k him if he would di&s;po&s;e of his regiment. To which he
an&s;wered, that having never done any thing 'that could di&s;plea&s;e the
Queen, and having &s;erved her faithfully, he could not imagine he de|&s;erved
to be broke: that, to &s;ay the truth, he had no de&s;ire to di&s;po&s;e of
his regiment; and that the Queen was mi&s;tre&s;s to do what &s;he cho&s;e.
But as he cannot prevent the &s;torm, in ca&s;e they wanted to oblige him
to re&s;ign, he intends to con&s;ult his friends; and if they judge it proper,
he will make as much as he can of his regiment, rather than allow him|&s;elf
to be deprived of it, for a trifling &s;um, at which the price will be
fixed, as happened to others."</P>

<P>"I Waited upon lord Oxford, the day before ye&s;terday, to expre&s;s my

to a&s;k him it he had any orders to give me. He an&s;wered to this, that
he would come to &s;ee me again; intimating to me, that he would choo&s;e
to have a private conver&s;ation with me, in order to give me his &s;entiments
of the Elector's affairs in this country, and of the mea&s;ures which, in
his opinion, he &s;hould take in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. I entreated him
then, after having thanked him for his good intentions to my ma&s;ter, to
name an hour, that I might have the honour of coming to wait on him,
which he did not choo&s;e, putting me off till his return from Wind&s;or;

<P>When I a&s;ked him if he had recommended to the Queen his Electoral
Highne&s;s's rank in the Electoral college, and his office of arch trea&s;urer,
without an&s;wering by yes or no, he made great prote&s;tations to me of his
zeal, of which he was willing to give proofs, without being inflnenced by
hopes of being recompen&s;ed; but, in order to have no rea&s;on to reproach
him&s;elf hereafter, that he neglected to give the &s;alutary advices which he
thought him&s;elf obliged to give."</P>

<P>Having rea&s;oned with lord Halifax on this event, we imagine, that
from this mea&s;ure we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e one of two things, or perhaps both;
either that the Queen appears to the lord trea&s;urer to be in &s;uch a bad

Highne&s;s, or that things are not yet come to maturity here in favour of
the Pretender, and that France does not choo&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to mount the
throne, nor to give him the number of troops which his friends judge
nece&s;&s;ary. But, in either ca&s;e, he thinks that we can draw great advan|tage

<P>"AS to Fergu&s;on, who calls him&s;elf Ker of Ker&s;land, the character I
have given of him may be depended on. I am of your Excel|lency's
opinion, that the letter you was plea&s;ed to &s;end a tran&s;lation of,

<P>Ridpath, in this long and tedious letter, confutes all that Ker had
written of the Cameronians and of the Pre&s;byterians in general, and of

true he had intere&s;t enough among the Cameronians, on his wife's ac|count,
at the time of the Union, to keep them from breaking up the
parliament; but he was well paid for it, by the lord Godolphin and the
D. of Queen&s;berry, and by that money bribed others to concur with him;
but that being now known, the Cameronians hate him and call him a
traitor."</Q></P>
<P>Fergu&s;on, it &s;eems, had married the elde&s;t daughter of Ker of Ker&s;|land,
and the male heirs being extinct, a&s;&s;umed tile name of the family.
<Q REND="inline">"He did get money from lord Godolphin, on pretence of his intere&s;t
with the Cameronians, and that he was courted by France; but upon
the change, he played the knave, and endeavoured to blacken the late
mini&s;try, as not having li&s;tened to his information of a Jacobite plot, and
that he could procure an addre&s;s from 15,000 Cameronians for &s;ettling

the Hannover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and by this means got money from the pre&s;ent

<P>"HAving &s;poke, a few days ago, to lord Town&s;hend and lord Cowper,
on their return from the country, before they had &s;een any of
our friends, they &s;aid the very &s;ame things to me, which I wrote to you
already. I hope, therefore, you will maturely weigh an affair of &s;o great
importance, on which depends your &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the fortune and lives
of tho&s;e who have your intere&s;ts at heart in this country, and who are
devoted to your &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider further, that if ever the Pretender mounts the throne, (which
he will undoubtedly do, if he comes with a French army, <HI>i. e.</HI> 10 or
12,000 men, before any of the family is here) in what manner England
and France in conjunction will concur in your ruin, and in the de&s;truc|tion
of a family, which they will know they di&s;obliged &s;o much, by rob|bing
it of a crown which was de&s;tined for it, and of which they will not
believe them&s;elves to be in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, while that family re|mains
on a good footing. I leave it to you to con&s;ider, what efforts they
will make to ruin it, in one way or other.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;ufficiently convinced, ever &s;ince the &s;ame thing has been
&s;o often repeated to you, that the mini&s;try of this country make great
<PB N="556" REF="579">
efforts to weaken our party among the people, by making them believe,
that the oaths which they take, as well as the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, regard the
Electoral family merely becau&s;e they were the neare&s;t prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,
at the time when the&s;e acts were pa&s;t; and that, as they were pa&s;t merely
to prevent the danger of &s;eeing the crown of the&s;e kingdoms fall into the
hands of a Roman Catholic, the principal de&s;ign was to have a prote&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;or. That, therefore, it was &s;ufficient to an&s;wer that de&s;ign; and
that, to find a prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who was nearer of kin than the
Electoral family, would be a thing which was ju&s;t, and to which every
true Engli&s;hman ought to be naturally inclined.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;onings have their weak &s;ide, of which I wi&s;h the nation was
as thoroughly per&s;uaded as I am. But the real &s;tate of this kingdom at
pre&s;ent is, that all hone&s;t men, without di&s;tinction of party, acknowledge,
that although of every ten men in the nation nine &s;hould be for us, it is
certain, that of fifteen Tories there are fourteen who would not oppo&s;e
the Pretender, in ca&s;e he came with a French army; but, in&s;tead of
making any re&s;i&s;tance to him, would be the fir&s;t to receive and acknow|ledge
him.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e very certain, that if &s;ome prince of the Electoral family
came now to this country, all tho&s;e who are at this time in office would
ha&s;ten to make their court to him, and things would be made quite &s;afe
and &s;olidly &s;ettled in our favour.</P>
<P>What an&s;wer &s;hall I make to the&s;e facts, which I know to be certain!
How can I encourage men, whom you do not choo&s;e to acknowledge or
&s;upport, either by money or by &s;ending over &s;ome one of the family? Or,
in &s;hort, what other mea&s;ures can I take, which will give them courage,
at a time when they know for certain, that the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament
will not end without enfringing the acts of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? And what remedy
do you imagine you can then apply, which may prevent or di&s;concert
their de&s;ign? Is it Mr. Harley's emba&s;&s;y, and the manner in which the
lord trea&s;urer and he explain them&s;elves to me? Is it the proofs, which
they give you of their attachment at Utrecht? In &s;hort, what is it?"</P>
<P>For my &s;hare, Sir, I entreat you to employ all the&s;e rea&s;ons to con|vince
our ma&s;ter, without being re&s;trained by any apprehen&s;ions of hurt|ing
my fortune thereby. I had rather lo&s;e it, by &s;aving men of honour,
who are in the intere&s;ts of his Electoral Highne&s;s, and by &s;howing him the
<PB N="557" REF="580">
true &s;tate in which his affairs are in this country, than fail to inform
him of his danger of lo&s;ing both his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and perhaps &s;omething
el&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e things mu&s;t undoubtedly appear di&s;agreeable to you. Judge
then, how I mu&s;t con&s;ider them, and with what &s;atisfaction I can hear
them repeated to me &s;o often, by all tho&s;e who are generally acknow|ledged
to po&s;&s;e&s;s abilities and zeal, and who have had the con&s;tancy, till
now, of remaining attached to our intere&s;ts; although, without a mira|culous
interpo&s;ition in their favour, as well as in ours, they mu&s;t believe
them&s;elves to be ab&s;olutely lo&s;t, &s;eeing them&s;elves entirely abandoned by

<P>"I Wrote to you, on the 6th of January, and then offered my opinion
of what I thought was for your &s;ervice. I know not if my letter
came &s;afe. Since that time, and before, I have been following out the
method appeared to me the propere&s;t to advance that intere&s;t I &s;hall ever
&s;erve, and which are, to unite upon the main di&s;tinction of being friends
to the e&s;tabli&s;hment and prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion all tho&s;e whom I had
ground to believe wi&s;hed well to them, but, by &s;ome unhappy incidents,

friend&s;hip and corre&s;pondence with you: both which I have advanced a
good dale, notwith&s;tanding of &s;ome rubs I have met with in both, need|le&s;s

<P>Matters, &s;ince that time, have pre&s;&s;ed a little harder. The Queen,

Jacobites, who have been over looked, while others were under di&s;cou|ragements,
and who had provided them&s;elves in arms, &s;eemed ready to
make a pu&s;h for their favourite Pretender; and many of the Popi&s;h and
Jacobite nobility and gentry came to town, as is &s;u&s;pected with that view.
Whereupon, friends, I can't give their names here, met and con&s;idered
what might be proper upon this emergency. The &s;afety of this place
&s;oon appeared to be of the la&s;t con&s;equence to the cau&s;e in general in this
country, both for its being the fate of the government here, and &s;o a
right place, more ob&s;ervable and important, for the life and &s;pirit it mu&s;t
give to meaner and remote places, and becau&s;e of the public money's

<P>To &s;ecure this place, therefore, the magi&s;trates, who are generally well

that the church of England was in danger, and concurred in the mea|&s;ures

he left them about a year and a half ago, and even hindered her Maje&s;ty

<OPENER><DATELINE>London <DATE>16/27 February, 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"UPON the 'late change of the mini&s;try, there was a general rumour
that the Queen was to &s;end the earl of Rivers to Hannover, to de|&s;ire
the Elector to &s;end a prince of his family to re&s;ide in England, which
at that time the trea&s;urer gave out as a thing determined upon, and even
told the lords Somers and Halifax, as in great confidence, that the Queen
intended to offer the Elector the command of the army in Flanders, and
this was told in &s;uch a manner that the&s;e lords believed it. But it was
&s;oon found that this &s;tory was only to amu&s;e the nation, and to re e&s;ta|bli&s;h
credit in &s;ome degree; and that the trea&s;urer might know the di&s;|po&s;ition
of the hou&s;e, as in the infancy of his mini&s;try he could not know
how every individual would allow him&s;elf to be managed."</P>
<P>"The &s;ame rumour was &s;pread two years ago, at the meeting of the
parliament; upon which, however, I will not in&s;i&s;t, as it appears to
have been rather a direct mockery, than that the &s;ituation of affairs then
required it. But now things are come to a cri&s;is; a new parliament is
cho&s;en, and the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, which is always a delicate matter, has not the
de&s;ired effect; trade is interrupted; France is victorious over the em|pire,
and behaves with haughtine&s;s to her friends as well as enemies. The
lord trea&s;urer, by his haughtine&s;s and breaches of promi&s;e, is per&s;onally
<PB N="565" REF="588">
hated by many people. A con&s;iderable party begin to make an outcry
about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and other things. The bank, and con&s;equently the pub|lic
credit, is in a very bad &s;ituation; the &s;tocks fall; the people are di&s;con|tented;
and la&s;tly, the Queen is in &s;o bad a &s;tate of health, that nobody
believes &s;he can live long.</P>
<P>In &s;uch circum&s;tances, it is not to be wondered that the trea&s;urer falls
to his old &s;hifts, and finding that the report of the duke of Kent's going
to Hannover has little effect (as every body is per&s;uaded that were the
court in earne&s;t, one would be &s;ent of &s;ome intere&s;t in either party) he
now gives out, that the Queen has given occa&s;ion to an invitation, and
that &s;ecretary Bromley was not only to propo&s;e it to the lower hou&s;e,
but was in per&s;on to go to Hannover, to deliver the Queen's me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid above of the lord trea&s;urer's conduct, particularly
with regard to lord Rivers's emba&s;&s;y, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;e doubts, as to his
&s;incerity in this,&mdash;and not to &s;peak of the Queen's per&s;onal inclinations,
when one con&s;iders the lord trea&s;urer's behaviour, at the very time he
makes &s;uch great promi&s;es, I do not &s;ee the lea&s;t regard can be had to
them; I mu&s;t own that one here, on the &s;pot, can judge of this better,
than can be &s;hown by a letter. I &s;hall, however, add one or two remarks.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve in general, that to make &s;o great and &s;ud|den
a change of mea&s;ures, is very difficult, and requires near connexions
with another &s;et of people, which hitherto has not happened; neither is
the fir&s;t mini&s;ter in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that he can act &s;o cavalierly with
France and the Jacobites here, who are not &s;o contemptible a party as is
generally believed, without having made up with the other party, as hath
been &s;aid.</P>
<P>2dly, The Jacobites are more and more encouraged, and are daily
placed in all the &s;mall po&s;ts, of which no li&s;ts are kept; and, as to the
great employments, it is certain, that lord Stairs and the duke of Argyle
have lo&s;t theirs.</P>
<P>3dly, The court is bu&s;y, at this moment, to get out, by petitions or
otherwi&s;e, from the hou&s;e of commons, all tho&s;e who have di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and particularly an inquiry is made, in a
mo&s;t &s;candalous and inqui&s;ition-like manner, again&s;t Mr. Walpole, who
has made him&s;elf formidable, and it is re&s;olved to have him <HI>per fas et
nefas</HI> voted out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="566" REF="589">
4thly, There is good rea&s;on to believe, that the report of confirming
the act of regency, which has been &s;poken of, is not without grounds,
nay, that it appears to be really re&s;olved upon; and the &s;ucce&s;s of
this matter is the le&s;s doubted of at court, that it appears very
plau&s;ible to the Tories. To whom they &s;et forth, that in the &s;ealed act,
as it now &s;tands, mo&s;t of the lords of the regency are Whigs, and &s;o they
mu&s;t fall into the hands of their enemies, whereas, if the next &s;ucce&s;&s;or is
fixed by a new in&s;trument, to be regi&s;tered in Chancery, decency will
require that, at lea&s;t, a certain number of Tories &s;hould be named with
them. Others &s;ay, that the nomination will be le&s;t to the Queen and
parliament. Be that as it will, it is certain, that if the act of regency un|dergo
this change, it is in fact annulled, and &s;o the &s;tronge&s;t wall in fa|vour
of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, thrown down. How all the&s;e things agree with the
pre&s;ent offers is ea&s;y to judge.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to flatter my&s;elf into a belief, that the lord trea|&s;urer
acts in this matter uprightly; but can find no rea&s;ons to encourage
me to &s;uch a belief. When one con&s;iders that man's humour and way
of acting, they may think, that perhaps the Jacobite party grows too
&s;trong for him, and that, &s;uppo&s;ing the Queen's health re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, to
keep that party in awe, and perhaps to get &s;omething from France, he
will &s;how them he is not in &s;o bad a &s;ituation, but that he can do without
them, and for &s;ome time continue his game without being obliged to de|clare
for the one or the other party. All this might be &s;uppo&s;ed of this
mini&s;ter, if one did not reflect, that the pre&s;ent &s;tep is of too much impor|tance,
and that he had not rea&s;on to be afraid of the propo&s;als being
really brought to a bearing. Tho&s;e that think he has been obliged to
this &s;tep again&s;t his will, have a better opinion of the lower hou&s;e than I
have, unle&s;s the &s;tate of the Queen's health is &s;o bad, that there is no ap|pearance
of her being able to come to London; allow me to add, that the ad|vantages
that the lord trea&s;urer will draw, or &s;eeks to draw, from the pre|&s;ent
propo&s;als, are the&s;e.</P>
<P>1&s;t, In general to amu&s;e the people, and to prevent the fall of credit.</P>
<P>2dly, To prevent &s;ome Tories coming into mea&s;ures with the Whigs,
and &s;o hinder the&s;e la&s;t from making &s;ome di&s;agreeable overtures in the
beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="590">
3dly, To afford to the&s;e that pretend to be friends to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
yet for private intere&s;t will not break with the trea&s;urer, an excu&s;e for
not meddling, in any thing, in favour of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; &s;o that the trea|&s;urer
will by this means, gain &s;ome weeks, during which time he will be
able to bring his forces into order, and may then laugh at every one for
the re&s;t of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and undertake, with &s;afety, to change the act of
regency.</P>
<P>Lord Cowper having under&s;tood that there was a writ made out, at
the chancellor's office, for the hereditary prince, as duke of Cambridge,
to appear in parliament, employed the clerk who gives out the writs to
the peers, to enquire at the lord chancellor, whether he &s;hould bring
the Electoral Prince's writ to the envoy of the Elector's court. The chan|cellor
received him in a very angry manner, enquired who had employed
him in that me&s;&s;age, reprimanded him &s;everely, and ordered that the
writ &s;hould not be delivered out of the office, even though enquired for.
The officers &s;ent by Mr. Stanhope to the Boulonnoi&s;e and Flanders are
returned, and report that they found no troops in motion there, only that
nine Iri&s;h battalions and a regiment of dragoons were advanced from
Lorrain, and in quarters at Douay, Valenciennes, and He&s;din, and that
the officers &s;aid openly, that they had orders to be ready to march upon
a minute's warning.</P>
<P>After I had ended this letter, I have learned from good authority, that
Mr. Harley's in&s;tructions bear, to let his Electoral Highne&s;s know, that a
faction of ill di&s;po&s;ed people di&s;turbed her Maje&s;ty's government, by
rai&s;ing jealou&s;ies and alarms, particularly with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
notwith&s;tanding the act &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was in full force; that her
Maje&s;ty would however, do all &s;he could, with honour, to make his
Highne&s;s ea&s;y as to that matter; but that, if to chagrin her, an invitation
&s;hould be propo&s;ed to parliament, &s;he would look upon it as a per&s;onal
affront. I cannot be &s;ure of the truth of this information, but as I had
it from good hands, I thought it my duty to communicate it."</P>

<PB N="568" REF="591">
&s;ervant, and to beg the continuation of the honour of your good
graces, and tho&s;e of your commands, if you have any in this country. I
thought Mr. Harley would have been over, by this time, and then Mon|&s;ieur
Lahonton would have &s;een the effects your Royal Highne&s;s has over
me, &s;ince nothing is harder at our court to obtain, than money; though
I mu&s;t own, in this ca&s;e, naming your name, my lord trea&s;urer was as
ready as I was to obey any command of your Royal Highne&s;s's. I could
not have imagined, till I was in England, the heats and animo&s;ities there
is among&s;t people even of the &s;ame principles; and, believe me, Madam,
all the noi&s;e made about the Pretender is groundle&s;s; and the Tories are
full as much in your intere&s;t, or rather more, than the Whigs, though
the latter have of late got up a way of threatening the Tories with the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as if your Royal Highne&s;s, or tho&s;e of your illu&s;|trious
hou&s;e, who &s;hould &s;ucceed the Queen, were not to reign over the
Tories, as well as the Whigs. I am &s;atisfied that your Royal Highne&s;s
knows Great Britain too well, not to know who are hone&s;t men, and who
otherwi&s;e, without the di&s;tingui&s;hing names of Whig and Tory: for I am
&s;ure you know, what is called Tory, are tho&s;e which are for the church of
England, which is all or almo&s;t all the clergy of England; a great ma|jority
in the parliament and nation, and almo&s;t all the landed men in the
kingdom; who &s;hould be more de&s;irous than they to &s;ecure their religion
and liberty to their po&s;terity; and you may depend upon it, Madam,
they are all heartily in your intere&s;t? I need no better proofs, than that
famous book of Steel's, called, The Cri&s;is, which the Whigs cry up &s;o
much, and which I think is demon&s;tration to your Royal Highne&s;s, that
you have nothing to fear from the Tories. Are they not all &s;worn to
your &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? Have they not all abjured the Pretender? And is there
one man either in parliament, mini&s;try, or any place of tru&s;t, that is not
&s;worn to &s;upport your &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and to oppo&s;e the Pretender's? Are
not our laws made &s;o &s;trong, that it is high trea&s;on to do any thing
again&s;t your &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? Can any one pretend to &s;uppo&s;e, that all the
clergy, all the men of the greate&s;t e&s;tates in the kingdom, would at once
venture &s;oul, and body, and fortune, to be in the intere&s;t of one, who puts
their religion and liberties in danger? Can any hone&s;t man pretend to
&s;ay, that all the&s;e people would voluntarily engage to be damned, to be
hanged, and to lo&s;e, at once, all their e&s;tates and liberty, from them&s;elves
<PB N="569" REF="592">
and po&s;terity? All I could wi&s;h is, that means could be found out to
quiet people's minds, and that the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould not be
more the cry of one party than the other; that it &s;hould be (as it is)
e&s;teemed the good of both parties and of all the kingdom. I flatter my&s;elf
I have &s;ome place in your good opinion, el&s;e I dur&s;t not take the liberty
I do to a&s;&s;ure you, that I know all the pre&s;ent mini&s;try is as much, or
more &s;incerely in your intere&s;t than the la&s;t were. I had a very good op|portunity
to know it; for when the Queen was lately &s;o ill, that people
began to make reflection, if &s;he &s;hould have died, and being to be, by
my po&s;t, as fir&s;t lord of the admiralty, one of the &s;even regents, or lords
ju&s;tices, in ca&s;e of a demi&s;e, I &s;aw &s;o entire and &s;o &s;trong a re&s;olution
to adhere to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that I &s;hall never be more in any
doubt about it. Let me beg, Madam, that what I have writ may be
kept to your&s;elf, and that you will not &s;how my letter, but burn it; be|ing
I only mean what I write for your own private information, being you
have always u&s;ed me with that goodne&s;s, I may &s;ay kindne&s;s, that I can't
do too much to &s;how my gratitude and real zeal for your intere&s;t. The
Queen, by all our relations, is &s;o perfectly recovered, that &s;he may live
many years; wherefore, I &s;han't be &s;u&s;pected of flattery, and were &s;he
in a wor&s;e &s;tate of health, I dur&s;t not have ventured to write on this

<P>"I Receiv'd &s;ome time ago the favour of your letter of the 26th of Ja|nuary,
but defer'd an&s;wering it, til Mr. Cadogan returned from
the Hague with an account of the &s;eitation of things and di&s;po&s;ition of
people there, &s;ince her Maje&s;ty's illne&s;s. I am very glad to find by him,
the republick takes the alarm, and begins to wake out of the lethargy it
has fallen into, &s;ince the peace at Utrick. It is true, indeed, the
Queen's health growing &s;o bad, as in all probability &s;he can never recover
it, and the mini&s;ter's making &s;uch open &s;teps in favour of the Pretender,
<PB N="570" REF="593">
as to leave no doubt of their intentions to place him on the throne, has
brought things &s;o near a deci&s;ion, that unle&s;s the &s;tates de&s;ign to look on
and &s;ee us lo&s;t, and con&s;equently them&s;elves, they could no longer re|main
inactive, or delay entering into &s;uch vigorous mea&s;ures, as are ab|&s;olutly
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave us both. The fir&s;t and great mark of their
pre&s;ent good di&s;po&s;ition, is their &s;ecret re&s;olution to &s;et out, as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible, a &s;trong &s;quadron of men of war; for which they have found a
very plau&s;ible pretext, when their preparations are &s;o far advanced, as
to oblige them to own it. They have likewi&s;e, in ca&s;e of her Maje&s;ty's
death, agreed on the mo&s;t proper means for a&s;&s;i&s;ting his Electoral High|ne&s;&s;e
with their troops, and doing every thing that depends on them
for his &s;ervice, which I omit explaining, &s;ince you have been particularly
informed of it by Mon&s;ieur Bothmar. I &s;hall only add, that they have
promi&s;ed to go on with their &s;ea-preparations, though her Maje&s;ty &s;hou'd
continue to langui&s;h on for &s;ome weeks longer; for it has been &s;hewn
them, our danger would be greate&s;t in that ca&s;e, for it would give the
mini&s;ters time to concert every thing with France, for bringing in the Pre|tender,
even whiel&s;t the Queen was alive; therefore, all mea&s;ures to
&s;upport the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his Electoral Highne&s;s, would prove ineffectual,
unle&s;s a &s;leet was ready to ob&s;truct the Pretender's pa&s;&s;age, and to con|voy
&s;uch troops as mu&s;t be &s;ent to join with the nation, in order to re&s;i&s;t
him.</P>
<P>Mr. Cadogan returns this week to the Hague, and intends, in a few
days after, for England; the meeting of the parliament obliging him to
ha&s;ten there. He hopes, before he goes, to receive the honour of his
Electoral Highne&s;s's commands; and our friends in England a&s;&s;ure them|&s;elves,
&s;uch vigorous re&s;olutions will &s;peedily be taken, as the greatne&s;s
of the danger requires. I have &s;o often acquainted you with my thoughts
on this &s;ubject, as that makes it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing more of it
now. I have received the commi&s;&s;ion his Electoral Highne&s;s has been
plea&s;ed to honour me with. I mu&s;t beg of you to make him my mo&s;t
humble and &s;incere acknowledgements, for this new mark of favour and
confidence. I &s;hall make the be&s;t u&s;e I can of it, for his &s;ervice, in the
advancing of which I am always ready to hazard both life and fortune.
I con&s;tantly tran&s;mit whatever I receive of con&s;equence from England
to Mon&s;ieur Bothmar, that he may comunicat it to the pen&s;ioner, at the

<P>"OUR friends having, for a long time, deliberated on the mea&s;ures
they &s;hould take for the en&s;uing parliament, have at la&s;t agreed,
that their be&s;t conduct will be to meddle in nothing, and to propo&s;e no|thing
in parliament. The rea&s;on they commonly and openly allege is,
to &s;how lord Angle&s;ea, Sir Thomas Hanmer, and men of that character,
who have credit with the High Church party, and pretend to be our
friends, that it is not from a &s;pirit of faction they have acted till now, and
they can be quiet, and do not de&s;ire forcibly to a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves
the glory of &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but are ready to a&s;&s;ign to them, the
Tories, all the honour and all the merit of it, and to promi&s;e to &s;econd
them, at the time, and in the manner they them&s;elves &s;hall pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides they &s;aw, as they told Kreyenberg, that all their efforts would
be ineffectual, unle&s;s the Elector took &s;ome deci&s;ive &s;tep, on his &s;ide,
and they were not &s;ure but he attributed their conduct more to private
than to public views. They would wait, until they heard what Mr.
<PB N="572" REF="595">
Harley did at Hannover, and what an&s;wer was given him, and they
would regulate them&s;elves accordingly. This re&s;olution made Kreyen|berg
very unea&s;y, as he was afraid it proceeded from de&s;pair, and from
an apprehen&s;ion that they were blamed and abandoned by the Elector.</P>
<P>With regard to my lord Angle&s;ea, I can venture to &s;ay, from my own
knowledge of him, that he is rather for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, than for the Pre|tender:
but, at the &s;ame time, we may depend upon it, that he will do
nothing, but in certain circum&s;tances, and that he will not break with the
court, unle&s;s the Elector or the Electoral Prince is here; and that is
the ca&s;e of Sir Thomas Hanmer and of &s;everal others.</P>
<P>Lord Notingham urged Angle&s;ea very much, to enter into mea&s;ures
for propo&s;ing an invitation; but he always an&s;wered, that it was not ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
and that it could not be done with propriety, as the Electoral
Prince, in quality of peer, could come over whenever he plea&s;ed, and
as all the Oxfords in the univer&s;e could not hinder him."</P>

<P>"I Was informed, a few days ago, &s;ays he, that the Queen's mi|ni&s;try
triumph when they are together, e&s;pecially in their drunk|enne&s;s,
at their having, at la&s;t, engaged her Maje&s;ty to order Mr.
Harley, to make it clearly known to the Elector and Electre&s;s, that the
coming of any one of the Electoral Family into this country, would di&s;|plea&s;e

which they them&s;elves would choo&s;e to a&s;k, for further e&s;tabli&s;hing the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion in their family."</P>
<P>From thence Schutz draws &s;everal arguments for the coming of the
Electoral Prince, and then proceeds.</P>
<P>"You have been already told, that, of ten who are for us, nine will
accommodate them&s;elves to the times, and embrace the intere&s;ts of him
who will be the fir&s;t on the &s;pot, and who will undoubtedly have the be&s;t
game and all the hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, rather than expo&s;e them&s;elves, by
their oppo&s;ition, to a civil war, which appears to them a real and an im|mediate
evil; whereas, they flatter them&s;elves, that the government of
<PB N="573" REF="596">
the Pretender, whom they look upon as a weak prince, will not be &s;uch a
great evil, as a civil war. And we want to flatter our&s;elves, when we
imagine, that tho&s;e who call them&s;elves our friends, are &s;uch heroes, as
that the love of their religion, and their attachment to us, will animate
them &s;ufficiently to expo&s;e them&s;elves willingly to the greate&s;t dangers,
to maintain the rights of a family, which is di&s;tant from them, and which
always &s;hewed great indifference for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of the&s;e
kingdoms."</P>
<P>In another letter of the &s;ame date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover papers, vol. marked Bothm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r x. p. 303.</NOTE> he expre&s;&s;es great impatience to
know what impre&s;&s;ions his arguments have made at Hannover. "Al|though
I ought to be at perfect ea&s;e, whatever turn affairs may take now,
as I did not neglect to give you all the nece&s;&s;ary and &s;uitable advices, I
own that I take the thing too much to heart, and find my &s;ituation di&s;|agreeable,
to hear every day tho&s;e whom you your&s;elves acknowledge to
be your be&s;t friends, complain that you abandon them, and wantonly
neglect our intere&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding their intreaties and their clear re|pre&s;entations
to you of the danger to which you are expo&s;ed; when, at
the &s;ame time, I under&s;tand, that in &s;pite of all my importunities, there is
any he&s;itation to repre&s;ent to our ma&s;ter, what concerns him &s;o much to
know.</P>
<P>After repeating the complaints of their friends, and their re&s;olution to
do nothing in parliament, as mentioned in former letters from him&s;elf and
from Kreyenberg, he writes, for the fir&s;t time, about an affair which
Kreyenberg had mentioned in a letter in&s;erted above, and which made a
great noi&s;e thereafter.</P>
<P>"Chancellor Harcourt, to whom it was propo&s;ed to &s;end to me the writ
of the duke of Cambridge, without his being able to &s;u&s;pect that the pro|po&s;al
came from me, gave a very bad reception to the per&s;on who made
the motion to him, and &s;trictly forbad his clerks to bring it to me, or to
give it to tho&s;e who might call for it, without an expre&s;s order from him.
You may judge now the rea&s;ons of this prohibition, and whether it pro|ceeds
from him&s;elf alone. The writ is in his office, in all the forms,
with the great &s;eal, and in a more authentic manner than the writ of
other peers, from whence one may judge, that the princes of the blood
u&s;ually had them.</P>
<P>I imagine you ea&s;ily conceive the embarra&s;&s;ment I mu&s;t be in, in regard
to this writ. A great many, knowing that the chancellor has not &s;ent it
<PB N="574" REF="597">
to me, are &s;urpri&s;ed I do not a&s;k it. Now, how can I do &s;o, having no or|ders
from you? I own however, that this alone would not hinder me,
if I could flatter my&s;elf, that, after I &s;hall receive it and &s;end it by
expre&s;s to Hannover, which I would have done if I had got it, the Elec|toral
Prince will immediately &s;et out for this country.</P>
<P>Two things, he &s;aid, hindered him from a&s;king the writ: he was afraid
that the chancellor would venture to refu&s;e it; and that the Electoral
Prince, though he got it, would not come over."</P>

been actually with him for two hours, &s;peaking as ambiguou&s;ly as u&s;ual.

lord Cowper was made a peer; but when it was propo&s;ed to bring over

<P>"With regard to the Tories in general, I am very far from calling them

and it is certain, they will never oppo&s;e the Pretender, at the hazard of

and does not believe there is any; but I frankly acknowledge,
&s;ays he, that if matters ever go any length, the greate&s;t part of us Tories
will willingly &s;ubmit, while you Whigs will, perhaps, be fools enough
to expo&s;e your country to a civil war, and to be laid wa&s;te by the French
on the one hand, and by the Germans on the other."</P>
<P>Kreyenberg writes, that many of the Whigs would act, and that &s;ome
of them argued already in the &s;ame manner, and maintained, that nothing
could ju&s;tify a civil war if they could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;afe without it. They
&s;aw, that if the Pretender was once come over, it would be very ea&s;y to
hinder Holland or Denmark from giving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance: "and, what is
&s;till wor&s;e," continues Kreyenberg, "the Whigs do nothing new; partly
from the want of power, and partly from their chagrin, at &s;eeing them|&s;elves
neglected and abandoned, and it will not be long before they will
file off, after the re&s;t; I do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ean, that they will all become Jacobites;
but one will retire to the country, another leave the kingdom perhaps,
and &s;o on with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Till now, the Whigs in general allowed them&s;elves to be governed by
Devon&s;hire, Sunderland, Somers, Halifax, Town&s;hend, Cowper, Oxford,
and lately by Nottingham likewi&s;e, merely from the opinion they have,
that the&s;e noblemen act in perfect concert with the Elector, and have
great credit with his Electoral Highne&s;s: but they begin to perceive,
that matters do not go on as they imagined; and as men &s;eldom find out
<PB N="577" REF="600">
the true medium in things of this kind, they carry their rea&s;onings far|ther
than is ju&s;t. The duke of Argyle, &s;ince he has got a little into the
&s;ecret of the Whigs, appears to be greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, and God knows, if
in the humour he is in now, he will not join the fir&s;t. He dropt &s;ome
words to me, the other day, which convince me that his blood boils, and
that he is a man who will con&s;ult only his own intere&s;t."</P>

<P>"LORD Halifax entreated me to inform you of what he is re&s;olved
to do. He has charged tho&s;e among the Whigs who have
mo&s;t intercour&s;e with the Tories, to tell them, that for his &s;hare, he
would not &s;peak about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion any more in parliament. That they,
the Tories, being out of que&s;tion, the majority might do with regard to
it, whatever they plea&s;ed. That he renounced for ever all the advan|tages
which might re&s;ult to him, in ca&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould take place,
and that they might take all the merit of it to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>He made this declaration, only becau&s;e he &s;aw no other means of open|ing
people's eyes, and he has &s;ome de&s;ign of making it in parliament.
According to his opinion, unle&s;s the Queen or the Pretender dies &s;oon,
you may look upon the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as lo&s;t. The blame, he &s;ays, cannot
fall upon him, &s;ince it is certain, that if you had followed, even lately,
his advice, and the advice of all your friends, you would have prevented

<P>"HOPING that this letter will find you &s;afely arrived, I acquit my|&s;elf
of my promi&s;e, to give you an account of the bu&s;ine&s;s of which
you &s;poke to me here. I &s;hall begin with the propo&s;al of the Electoral
Prince's journey to England.</P>
<P>The Elector, having known, long ago, that the Queen was aver&s;e
from &s;eeing any of his family at her court, he&s;itated always for that rea|&s;on,
to &s;end the Prince, his &s;on. However, he would have complied at
length with the importunities of his friends in England, if notice had not
been given to him, that Mr. Harley was charged by the Queen to in|timate
to him, that the &s;ending the prince or any of the Electoral family,
would di&s;oblige her highly, and that &s;he would oppo&s;e their coming.
It is likewi&s;e ea&s;y to perceive, that her Maje&s;ty's &s;peech to the parliament
referred to that. The Elector hopes therefore, his friends will con&s;ider,
that the&s;e circum&s;tances render this journey impracticable, unle&s;s he has
a mind to come to an open rupture with the Queen. You and other
friends may judge, Sir, if that would be &s;ea&s;onable; if it would be for
<PB N="579" REF="602">
the advantage or di&s;advantage of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and if affairs at home
and abroad are in a &s;ituation to ju&s;tify &s;uch an extremity.</P>
<P>Since it appears then, to be impracticable to bring into the kingdom,
the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, whom the laws de&s;tine to the throne, it will be the more
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by removing the competi|tor.
The Elector made in&s;tances for that purpo&s;e to the Queen, by the
late baron de Grote, who gave a memorial on the &s;ubject to the lord
trea&s;urer: he will continue to do &s;o; when Mr. Harley arrives, he will
give it to him in writing; and baron de Schutz will have orders to &s;peak
in the &s;ame &s;tyle at your court.</P>
<P>His Electoral Highne&s;s is of opinion likewi&s;e, that the regency-bill
&s;hould not be changed from a pretence of amending it. He will &s;hew
Mr. Harley likewi&s;e, that he is &s;atisfied with it, and that he wi&s;hes it
may be pre&s;erved entire, which baron de Schutz had orders already to
tell to the lord trea&s;urer and to the re&s;t of the Queen's mini&s;ters. If there
is any thing el&s;e to be done, for the greater &s;ecurity and further e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, his Electoral Highne&s;s re&s;igns
him&s;elf to the opinions of his friends, who are the mo&s;t competent judges
for deciding concerning the utility, or nece&s;&s;ity, as well as practicability
of mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Queen's &s;peech gives room to think, that the court intends to
make things, which concern the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, the &s;ubject of de|liberation.
It is to be wi&s;hed, that the re&s;ult may contribute to its firmer
e&s;tabli&s;hment, and to be hoped, that there is no intention of making a
law to forbid the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or to come into the kingdom, during
the life of the Queen. It would be injurious to him to be put thereby,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on the &s;ame footing with the Pretender.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, Sir, you will inform our friends of the good di&s;po&s;ition
of this State in favour of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and of what they
were prepared to do, in ca&s;e the Queen had died, and of what the Elec|tor
him&s;elf was re&s;olved to do. The Queen's recovery does not make
them lo&s;e &s;ight of the&s;e things. The Emperor's peace changes a little
the &s;tate of affairs; but he will continue in arms for three months yet,
at lea&s;t, it being impo&s;&s;ible to conclude the peace finally before that
time. Endeavours will be u&s;ed. in the mean time to bring about an agree|ment
between the Emperor and the States about the barrier, in order
that his Imperial Maje&s;ty may have a good number of troops in the Low

<P>"AFTER having written to you a letter, which our friends may &s;ee,
on the three articles, of which we &s;poke together here, I take the

billet, on the article of pen&s;ions, e&s;pecially as the an&s;wer, in that re&s;pect,
is not &s;uch as I could wi&s;h; for they write to me, that the Elector does

not &s;uch a pur&s;e for things of that kind, as the lord trea&s;urer. All

<P>"FAR be it from me to pretend to complain of any mini&s;ter the Elec|tor
thinks fit to employ; but, upon this occa&s;ion, I find my&s;elf
oblidged to take notice, lea&s;t others &s;hould think fit to in&s;inuate com|plaints
again&s;t me, that I think in public, and upon the&s;e occa&s;ions of
conferences, to &s;ee what yet remains to be done in favour of the prote|&s;tant
religion. Mon&s;ieur Bothmar takes too warmly upon him to ju&s;tify
the Emperor and Roman Catholic princes proceedings; for even count
Sinzendorf him&s;elf owned to us, that though the Emperor had that ar|ticle
in the treaty of Ri&s;wick impo&s;ed upon him, yet &s;ince it was once
received, he would not do any thing to get it aboli&s;hed; and it has but a
very ill air in the world for a mini&s;ter of the Elector to begin always with
an in&s;inuation in public, that the Queen had not done enough, that &s;he had
it in her power, and that &s;he &s;hould have made France declare in po&s;itive
words, that they would aboli&s;h the fourth article of the treaty of Ri&s;wick.
<PB N="582" REF="605">
He was an&s;wered, that if the Emperor would but declare as much on his
&s;ide, as the French King had done, that article would be as good as aboli&s;hed.
Nay, Madam, I can a&s;&s;ure your Royal Highne&s;s there was not a mini&s;ter
of one prote&s;tant prince but took up the argument again&s;t baron Bothmar.
I told him, and repeated it, that the Queen had done, and would con|tinue
to u&s;e her mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing offices, in concert with the States General,
to di&s;po&s;e France to con&s;ent to a plain abolition of that clau&s;e, in expre&s;s
words, and hoped the princes of the Empire would do the &s;ame thing, on
their &s;ide, with the Emperor, at lea&s;t to bring his I. M. to declare as much
as France had done. I told baron Bothmar, if we had really at heart the
pro&s;perity and protection of the prote&s;tant religion, we &s;hould look for|wards,
and not backward (only to find out in&s;inuations of reproaches
one again&s;t another); and I mu&s;t, under the liberty your R. H. has al|lowed
me, &s;ay I was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at the di&s;tinction baron Bothmar
alone affected, in naming the States before the Queen; for all the other
mini&s;ters returned the princes their ma&s;ters' thanks, fir&s;t to the Queen,
and then to the States, for the care they expre&s;&s;ed for the intere&s;t of the
prote&s;tant religion in the Empire; but M. Bothmar, which was extremely
wondered at, and taken notice of by all, returned the Elector's thanks
to the States General, as well as the Queen, for their care, &amp;c. and,
throughout his whole &s;peech, never named the Queen, in preference to
the States, but always &s;aid the Maritime Powers, as if the Queen and
States were either equal in dignity or power. I could wi&s;h this way of
explaining him&s;elf was altered; for others of the Queen's &s;ervants might
think it nece&s;&s;ary to take more notice than I &s;hall; for mo&s;t &s;incerely
it &s;hall be always my utmo&s;t endeavours to keep up a perfect good un|der&s;tanding
between the Queen's court and yours, which is the only
rea&s;on I venter to give this information to your R. H. who I know
wi&s;hes that, on all occa&s;ions, tho&s;e of your court &s;hewed a particular def|ference

<P>"IT was once very likely I was to have important news to &s;end you
to-day, viz. that lord Oxford was without a &s;taff, abandoned by
all the mini&s;ters, and the Queen her&s;elf, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, prejudiced
again&s;t him. He a&s;ked her permi&s;&s;ion to lay down his office, when, at
the &s;ame time, he found &s;ome one to wait on the Queen, and tell her
that if &s;he gave him his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, the whole Tory party would be ruined,
and that &s;he would fall again into the hands of the Whigs. This ap|prehen&s;ion
appeared &s;o terrible to her, that &s;he tried all imaginable me|thods
of keeping him, and of reconciling him, two nights ago, with all
her mini&s;ters. If he had fallen, lord Nottingham would be at the head
of the trea&s;ury; as lord Angle&s;ea would approve of him only, of all our
friends.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more u&s;eful to our affairs, than that this reconcili|ation
&s;hould not continue. There is rea&s;on to fear, that our enemies may
prevail on the Queen to give her con&s;ent to the Pretender's coming here,
in her life-time. Lord Angle&s;ea di&s;covered a greater inclination to de|clare
him&s;elf openly for us, during the quarrels of the mini&s;try. The
duke of Argyle outdid him&s;elf in endeavouring to influence him, while
Mr. Hill and Sir Thomas Hanmer did every thing in their power like|wi&s;e.
The Archbi&s;hop of York is to have a conference with lord Not|tingham
tomorrow, at which the duke of Argyle will be pre&s;ent. In
&s;hort, our friends neglect nothing, and they de&s;erve that his Electoral High|ne&s;s
&s;hould expre&s;s his gratitude to them.</P>
<P>Be very attentive to the motions of the prince of Wales. I am a&s;&s;ured
he left Bar-le-Duc.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 325.</NOTE> Lord Oxford &s;ays, it is in order to go to Switzer|land:
but he &s;aid &s;o before, without its being true."</P>
<P>Kreyenberg wrote a long letter, of the &s;ame date, giving an account
of the divi&s;ions among the mini&s;try. The trea&s;urer him&s;elf told &s;everal
of his friends, that he would re&s;ign, and for that very rea&s;on, Kreyen|berg
did not believe him. He thought the cau&s;e of their di&s;pute was, that
they could not agree about the mea&s;ures for bringing in the Pretender (Bo|lingbroke
being warm and precipitate, and Oxford &s;low and dilatory in every
<PB N="586" REF="609">
thing, hating to act openly); or that they were jealous who &s;hould have
mo&s;t merit with him. Preten&s;ions to the Queen's favour could not pro|bably
be the cau&s;e of their quarrel; as they knew &s;he could not live
long. Kreyenberg adds in a po&s;t&s;cript:</P>
<P>"After writing this letter, I am informed with certainty, that the
Queen, at the &s;olicitation of lady Ma&s;ham, whom lord Bolingbroke
found means of gaining, had con&s;ented to the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the lord trea|&s;urer;
but that, the night before the la&s;t, there was a reconciliation on
certain conditions. It is more than probable, that this affair will be fol|lowed
with a change of mea&s;ures. The lord chancellor was for Boling|broke,
and Mr. Bromley was neuter."</P>
<P>Schutz wrote,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Schutz fils 8. p. 331.</NOTE> on the 30 March,/10 April, that the Whigs employed lord Not|tingham
to tell again to Sir Thomas Hanmer and lord Angle&s;ea, that
they entreated them to concur with them in the affair of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
and that they would renounce all their preten&s;ions to employments, and
do any thing the Tories could a&s;k of them. They thought a change ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the nation, and that the ea&s;ie&s;t and
mo&s;t acceptable to the Tories would be, to deprive lord Oxford of the
trea&s;urer's &s;taff, and to make Nottingham, his brother, and Mr. Hill
commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury. The&s;e propo&s;als of the Whigs made no
impre&s;&s;ion on the Tories. They hated lord Oxford; but they were afraid
his fall would kill the Queen. "That is, in plain Engli&s;h," &s;ays Schutz,
"if &s;he choo&s;e the prince of Wales &s;hould come and reign here, he mu&s;t
be received, for fear of putting her out of humour."</P>
<P>"Hanmer a&s;&s;ures me, that our acts are in no danger during this &s;e&s;&s;ion,
and he will not allow that the mini&s;try are again&s;t us, nor for the prince
of Wales."</P>

<P>"I Have been &s;o much afflicted with the accounts of my dear daughter

<P>"THE duke of Argyle brought about another meeting, la&s;t night,
between lord Angle&s;ea and Sir Thomas Hanmer, at which he, lord
Nottingham and &s;ome others a&s;&s;i&s;ted. After a great deal of rea&s;oning,
the&s;e three noblemen agreed upon the following articles.</P>
<P>1. To live in friend&s;hip with the Whigs, and to concert with them
what mu&s;t be done to &s;ecure the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and oppo&s;e the
Pretender.</P>
<P><PB N="588" REF="611">
2. Not to &s;upport lord Oxford, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in depriving
him of his employment.</P>
<P>3. Not to allow the Trea&s;ury to be in the hands of one man; but to
put it in commi&s;&s;ion: that our friends leave them to choo&s;e, for that
purpo&s;e, as they may judge proper; all acknowledging that it was as ne|ce&s;&s;ary
as it was prudent, to have in the Queen's council two or three
per&s;ons who would be for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and in oppo&s;ition to
the Queen's mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>They promi&s;e to join the Whigs in entreating the Queen, by an ad|dre&s;s,
to repeat her in&s;tances to the duke of Lorrain to &s;end the Pretender
out of his dominions; a&s;&s;uring her, that in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, they would
put her Maje&s;ty in a condition to oblige the duke by force to do what was
de&s;ired of him. They will &s;peak afterwards of Sir Patrick Lawle&s;s,
and intreat the Queen to &s;end him away, and to order the Jacobites and
the Highlanders in Scotland to be di&s;armed."</P>
<P>Kreyenberg wrote a long letter of this date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover papers, vol. marked Schutz fils 8. p. 339.</NOTE> in which he acquainted
his corre&s;pondent with the changes in the army. Lord Stair was obliged
to &s;ell his regiment to lord Portmore for 6000<HI>l.</HI> and the duke of Argyle
the company of life-guards to the earl of Dundonald, an avowed Jaco|bite,
for 10,000 <HI>l.</HI> of which the Queen gave 3000 <HI>l.</HI> The government of
the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh was to be given to a Mr. George Hamilton, an
officer in the Dutch &s;ervice, who was a &s;oldier of fortune, and would not
&s;urrender it, from fears of a forfeiture, as the duke of Gordon did, after
the Revolution. Colonels Sydney and Egerton, of the foot guards, bro|thers
to the earls of Leice&s;ter and Bridgwater, had notice from Gwyn,
the &s;ecretary at war, that the Queen had no further &s;ervice for them, and
that a thou&s;and guineas &s;hould be paid to each of them, for their com|panies,
which they had bought for the ordinary price of 3000 <HI>l.</HI> Colonel
Paget of the guards had the &s;ame notice; but the price was not yet fixed;
and it was &s;aid that lord Wind&s;or and general Lumley, though both
Tories, would lo&s;e their regiments. "The trea&s;urer prote&s;ts, that he
has no hand in the&s;e changes, and that the&s;e things are done without his
knowledge, as he &s;ays to &s;ome, or again&s;t his con&s;ent, as he &s;ays to
others."</P>
<P>"Nottingham was to have a final conference, la&s;t night, with the
archbi&s;hop of York, Angle&s;ea, and the &s;peaker, to &s;ee what they intend
<PB N="589" REF="612">
to do. He had full powers to tell them, that they had nothing to do,
but to order them&s;elves the manner in which they would choo&s;e to be
&s;upported by the Whigs; and that they might di&s;tribute offices as they
had a mind, providing they would take care of three things, 1. To &s;e|cure
the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: 2. To re-e&s;tabli&s;h the alliances broken by
the mini&s;try: 3. To pre&s;erve the commerce of the kingdom. We mu&s;t
wait for the i&s;&s;ue, although there is nothing to be expected from Angle|&s;ea,
and without him there is rea&s;on to believe the other two will do
nothing."</P>

days ago, in which &s;he &s;poke to him more openly than u&s;ual,
giving him to under&s;tand that, of the two parties which compo&s;ed the
nation, one was &s;u&s;pected of being inclined to bring in the Pretender,
in her life time, and the other, &s;ome one of the family of Hannover;

<P>Ple&s;&s;en endeavoured to convince the Queen, that the Elector would

her Maje&s;ty and the parliament; but that it was nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ure

but that he ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected tho&s;e of her mini&s;ters, and &s;aid many
things to convince her, that &s;he was bound in con&s;cience to &s;ecure the

<P>"WHAT the Queen did lately, when it was intended to pre&s;ent an

leaves no room to doubt of her &s;entiments, with regard to that man.
She &s;et all her mini&s;ters to work, and they &s;poke, one after another, in
oppo&s;ition to it, and think they have made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of every

<P>"I Have been honoured with your letter of the 13th in&s;t. and with the
letter of the Electre&s;s. By the advice of friends I behaved in this
manner. I made up to the chancellor, ye&s;terday, at court, when he
came there, at two o'clock, to pre&s;ent the addre&s;s of the lords, and beg|ged
of him to give me an hour after dinner; on which he an&s;wered, that
he would not go out that afternoon, and therefore left to my choice, the
hour at which I would choo&s;e to come.</P>

<P>"YOUR friends continue to a&s;&s;ure me, that the coming of the Elec|toral

the Pretender's coming were but too well founded. They were all de|lighted
with the order which the Electre&s;s gave me, to demand the writ

a&s;ked the advice of the following per&s;ons, and they were all of the &s;ame

<P>Angle&s;ea being in the country, I could not con&s;ult him before la&s;t

thing will be then ruined.</P>
<P>Therefore, he, as well as all our other friends, conjure the Elector to
&s;end over the Prince immediately, although the writ &s;hould be refu&s;ed,
as his pre&s;ence alone can re e&s;tabli&s;h every thing yet; and as every thing
will be lo&s;t after taking &s;uch a &s;tep, if we go no farther. Sir Thomas
Hanmer is of the &s;ame opinion, and promi&s;ed, as well as Lord Angle&s;ea,
to employ his influence with all tho&s;e who depend upon him in the hou&s;e

from the con&s;cience of my oaths, but out of profound re&s;pect to the
Elector's great virtues. I may without vanity &s;ay, that I had the great|e&s;t
hand in &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. I have ever pre&s;erved the &s;ame opi|nion;
and it is owing to the declarations the Queen has &s;o often made in
their favour, that the generality of the people are come to be for that
&s;erene hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, that lady Ma&s;ham, the Queen's favourite, is entirely for
their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. I am al&s;o &s;ure, that the Queen is &s;o; and you may do
me the ju&s;tice to a&s;&s;ure his Electoral Highne&s;s, that I am ready to give
him all the proofs of my attachment to his interes, and to &s;et in a true
light the &s;tate of this country; for it wil be very unfortunate for &s;o great
a prince, to be only prince over a party, wich can never la&s;t long in
England. And let me in confidence tell you, Sir, that there is but one
thing can be any way of prejudice to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in that family, and
that is the endeavour to bring them, or any of them, over without the
Queen's con&s;ent. Two courts in this country have been &s;o fatal, and the
factions are &s;o high, that it mu&s;t be very mi&s;chievous both to the Queen
and to that &s;erene hou&s;e, to have any &s;uch thing enterprized, that may create
<PB N="594" REF="617">
a difference between the Queen and that family: that wil change the
di&s;pute to the crown and the &s;ucce&s;&s;or; whereas now, it is between the
hou&s;e of Hannover and a popi&s;h Pretender.</P>
<P>I wil add but this one word, that I will a&s;&s;ure you, that upon any ad|vances
of kindne&s;s from the hou&s;e of Hannover, I will pawn my life for
it, they &s;hall receive mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential proofs of the Queen's friend&s;hip; and
I am &s;ure, that is the be&s;t confirmation of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A copy in Schrader's hand of what Schutz wrote in cyphers; inclo&s;ing
a copy of his letter to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor's an&s;wers. Urges
the &s;ending over the Electoral Prince.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>15/26 April, 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"I Received, Tue&s;day after midnight, or to &s;peak more properly Wed|ne&s;day
morning, a letter from the chancellor, of which I inclo&s;e a
copy, and al&s;o of the letter I wrote to him, Tue&s;day after &s;ix o'clock.
You will &s;ee that they &s;u&s;pect me of having acted without orders; hoping
perhaps, that, after they have opened &s;uch a door for us, I &s;hall be di&s;|avowed,
which I look to without any unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>" I was ye&s;terday morning at the chancellor's, to take the writ; but
he and all his clerks had gone out; &s;o that I returned empty handed.
From thence I went to the lord trea&s;urer's, who drew me a&s;ide and a&s;ked
if I had not the writ. I told him, I had not. He inquired if the chan|cellor
had not written to me, and I acquainted him how I had mi&s;&s;ed
him. He then &s;aid to me, that the Queen was very much &s;urpri&s;ed I
had never &s;aid any thing to her about it; adding, that &s;he had never been
treated in that manner. I an&s;wered that my orders having been addre&s;&s;ed
to the lord chancellor, I went to him; that I was &s;urpri&s;ed he did not
warn me of my mi&s;take, if it was nece&s;&s;ary to addre&s;s my&s;elf to the
Queen, which he might and &s;hould have known better than I. He ap|peared
to be in very bad humour, and much embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="595" REF="618">
Angle&s;ea and all our friends think, that I have taken the only method
of obtaining the writ; and that it is for that rea&s;on they in&s;inuate, that
the Queen complains I did not addre&s;s my&s;elf to her, in which ca&s;e they
would have endeavoured to divert the thing, with as much warmth as
they now employ to hinder the coming of the prince; and it is plain that
the emba&s;&s;y of lord Paget has no other de&s;ign, e&s;pecially as he is to &s;et
out immediately. There have been, however, great rejoicings over all
the city, &s;ince it was made public that I had a&s;ked the writ for the prince;
and &s;ome have no doubts of his coming &s;peedily, as others mo&s;t certainly
fear it. The bells were ringing for &s;ome days pa&s;t, and healths drunk
to his good journey.</P>
<P>The report which our enemies &s;pread every where, and which found
credit with a great number, that we were very indifferent about the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
will be con&s;idered as perfectly true, if, after having demanded
the writ, the Electoral Prince does not come over immediately.</P>
<P>I am come again from the chancellor's; although it was but 9 o'clock
in the morning, they a&s;&s;ured me that it was an hour &s;ince he went out,
which I con&s;ider as if they had a mind to amu&s;e me, and not to give me
the writ. The chancellor's letter, however, is po&s;itive.</P>
<P>I was this morning with Mr. Bromley, to expre&s;s to him my &s;urpri&s;e
at &s;eeing by the chancellor's letter, and by the lord trea&s;urer's di&s;cour&s;e
to me ye&s;terday, that the Queen thought it &s;trange, that I did not ad|dre&s;s
my&s;elf to her; repeating to him what I had &s;aid to lord Oxford,
and entreating him to inform her Maje&s;ty of it, who, I hoped, would
approve of the&s;e rea&s;ons, and not believe that there was any intention of
failing in the re&s;pect due to her, or of doing a thing that was di&s;agree|able."</P>

<P>In another letter of the &s;ame date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Schutz fils 8. p. 365.</NOTE> Schutz mentions the good effects

<P>Lord Angle&s;ea, who was with me for an hour ye&s;terday, is entirely of
the &s;ame opinion, and conjures the Elector to embrace this favourable
opportunity of pre&s;erving his right. All tho&s;e who are for him believe
the coming of the Electoral Prince to be as &s;alutary and advantageous, as

<P>"I Am to acknowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Engli&s;h copy.</NOTE> with the greate&s;t thankfulne&s;s, your letter of
the 29th of March, which came &s;afe, and has been communicated
where it was proper. All you mention with regard to the peace of Ra&s;|tadt,
agrees entirely with our &s;entiments here, and the pains your court
is taking towards bringing the Emperor and the States to an amicable
accommodation, in relation to the Netherlands, together with the hopes
you give us of &s;ucce&s;s in that grand affair, is a great encouragement to
all that wi&s;h well to the hou&s;e of Hannover. There is one pa&s;&s;age in
yours, where you &s;eem to think it is impo&s;&s;ible for the Pretender to make
<PB N="597" REF="620">
any attempt during the Queen's life. In this we are ab&s;olutely of ano|ther
opinion, for rea&s;ons, as we think, &s;o very obvious to tho&s;e who ob|&s;erve
with the lea&s;t attention the pre&s;ent conduct here, that there is no
need of entering into particulars on this head; and this being the &s;ettled
notion of all your friends here, you will ea&s;ily imagine, into how great a
degree of de&s;pair we were all thrown by that part of your letter, where
you mention the Elector's re&s;olution of not &s;ending the Electoral Prince
without a previous invitation. For it is but a &s;mall comfort to us, to &s;ee
how diligent and careful you are in taking remote precautions abroad,
whil&s;t we are convinced that the danger is &s;o imminent here, that we &s;hall
in all probability be totally ruined before any of tho&s;e &s;upports can po&s;|&s;ibly
come to our relief. But now I mu&s;t congratulate with you upon
Mon&s;. le baron de Schutz's la&s;t orders for demanding the Electoral
Prince's writ of &s;ummons. This I can a&s;&s;ure you is thought by every
body, both friends as well as enemies, to be the fir&s;t &s;tep that your court
has made, that looks as if you were in earne&s;t about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. No|thing
can be more effectual, if it be &s;upported by the immediate &s;ending
the Prince, nor more &s;ea&s;onable than it was at this time; for the Queen
had ju&s;t then given a mo&s;t unkind an&s;wer, to give it no wor&s;e term, to
an addre&s;s for the &s;upport of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and when the hou&s;e of lords
came to con&s;ider of this an&s;wer, the effect of the Electoral Prince's hav|ing
demanded his writ appeared mo&s;t plainly by the behaviour of a great
number of lords upon that occa&s;ion, though that news was not then pub|lickly
known. Mon&s;. Schutz will acquaint you with the con&s;ternation
our mini&s;ters were under, upon this occa&s;ion, and the fright the chan|cellor
was in, le&s;t it &s;hould be thought he had denied the writ. They
are &s;o &s;en&s;ible that this &s;tep, if it be followed by the immediate coming
of the prince, will &s;o effectually ruin their de&s;igns, and tend &s;o directly to
the &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from all future danger, that you may depend
upon their making u&s;e of all arts and contrivances imaginable to prevent
his coming. Neither threats nor flattery will be &s;pared. They are &s;o
intent and &s;o bent upon prevailing with you to &s;top the prince, that they
will not rely upon Mr. Harley's dexterity, but have determined to &s;end to
you my lord Pagett. You mu&s;t, therefore, prepare to be very vigo|rou&s;ly
attacked by way of me&s;&s;age; they &s;ee the &s;pirit of the people here
runs &s;o high in your favour, that they have no hopes of bringing either
them or parliament up to any thing, that may di&s;courage the prince's
<PB N="598" REF="621">
coming. They are, therefore, forced to turn all their views towards
you, and are reduced to the mi&s;erable nece&s;&s;ity of trying whether they
can per&s;uade your court to betray it&s;elf. I &s;hall trouble you no farther
than only to give you the unanimous opinion of all our friends upon this
occa&s;ion. They are per&s;uaded that you mu&s;t be convinced by the man|ner
in which this writ was granted, that you have opened a mo&s;t unexcep|tionable
way for the coming of the prince. It is plain, the writ would not
have been granted, could they, by law, have ju&s;tified the refu&s;ing of it; and
the unea&s;ine&s;s they expre&s;&s;ed, both when it was granted and &s;ince, &s;hews
plainly they would not have failed to have attempted &s;omething in par|liament,
in order to have di&s;couraged him from coming, could they have
had the lea&s;t hopes of carrying it. From this we cannot think, but that
you mu&s;t be &s;atisfied that the inclinations of the people here are &s;o
&s;trongly in favour of the hou&s;e of Hannover, that the prince may come,
not only with great &s;ecurity as to his per&s;on, but al&s;o that he will be re|ceived
with all the re&s;pect and honour that is due to him. But if, after
you have rai&s;ed the&s;e expectations through the whole kingdom to the
highe&s;t degree by the &s;tep you have made, you &s;hou'd be prevail'd upon
to abandon the thoughts of &s;ending the prince, or be per&s;uaded even to
delay it, &s;uch a proceeding will be &s;o fatal, that no man can be an&s;werable
for the con&s;equences of it. I cannot conclude this without doing ju&s;tice
to Mon&s;. le baron Schutz, who has upon this and all other occa&s;ions be|haved
him&s;elf with &s;o much zeal and prudence, that he has de&s;ervedly
got the entire e&s;teem and con&s;ideration of all, both Whigs and Tories,
who are well affected to the hou&s;e of Hannover."</P>

greate&s;t mark of contempt that could be given to her, telling me, that
had it not been for this incident, her Maje&s;ty would have invited the
Electoral Prince to come to pay her a vi&s;it next &s;ummer; without recol|lecting
that he had told me, but a moment before, that &s;he was too much

&s;he would willingly grant every thing el&s;e that could be demanded

<P>&mdash;"THE rea&s;on why Mon&s;. Dalay makes difficulty to go to the fo|reign
churches, which other mini&s;ters before him never did,
is, &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing the bill of occa&s;ional uniformity, about three years
ago, which only affects tho&s;e that are in employments of tru&s;t or profit;
&s;o that my lord Morpeth, having none, did not lye under tho&s;e difficul|ties
Mr. Dalay does. I make a doubt whether that act extends out of
her Maje&s;ty's dominions; but as it is a doubt, I would no more ri&s;que it
than I find Dalay will; and had it not been for Mr. Cadogan, I had not
minded it. But a&s;king him, ju&s;t after the act pa&s;&s;ed, to go with me to
the French church, to hear a famous preacher here; he told me, he did
<PB N="601" REF="624">
not know what I might do,<MILESTONE N="May." UNIT="month"> but for him, he was not &s;o fond of going to
any church, as to venture the lo&s;s of his employments, which he had not
then quitted: &s;o I, having a chaplain of my own, have never thought it
worth venturing to go to a foreign church, but have con&s;tantly the com|mon
prayers in my family, and &s;ermons every holiday."</P>
<P>"I am a&s;&s;ured his (lord Paget) errand is, to explain matters, and &s;et them
in &s;o true a light before you, that no artifice of a faction, or party, for
private views and intere&s;t, may be able for the future to cau&s;e any in|quietude
between the Queen and your illu&s;trious family. I took the li|berty,
at my la&s;t coming hither, to &s;tate that matter plainly to your Royal
Highne&s;s, who was &s;o good as to make me the an&s;wer I could wi&s;h, both
in relation to your re&s;pect for the Queen, and your being of neither
party; and yet I am &s;orry to find your mini&s;ter in England has lately
acted as if at lea&s;t he was governed by the party that is again&s;t the court,
becau&s;e the chief among&s;t them have not the chief employments at court;
and I am afraid his late behaviour is &s;omething re&s;ented, as being very
irregular, and neglectful of that re&s;pect due to the Queen: for though
by &s;trictne&s;s of law, I believe a peer may demand his writ of the lord
chancellor, though ab&s;ent, yet it is never done; but the lord chancellor
keeps it by him till &s;uch time as the ab&s;ent peer returns and demands it
him&s;elf, to &s;it in parliament. I know this better than any man, it hav|ing
been my ca&s;e under &s;everal lord chancellors, as I have been abroad
ever &s;ince the fir&s;t year her Maje&s;ty came to the crown, and having often
had leave to take turns into England, the chancellors have always kept
my writ till I came and demanded it to &s;it in parliament, which they
immediately were obliged to &s;end me; and &s;o it would have been with
the duke of Cambridge, whenever he &s;hould come into England to &s;it in
parliament. Upon his demanding it, the chancellor is obliged by law to
&s;end it him immediately. This being &s;o, what occa&s;ion had Mon&s;. Schutz
to go, ju&s;t at this juncture, and to demand it of the lord chancellor with|out
having previou&s;ly acquainted &s;ome of the Queen's mini&s;ters of &s;tate,
or having fir&s;t notified his intentions or orders (if he had them) to do
it to the Queen, by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, for her Maje&s;ty's approbation,
which he might have been a&s;&s;ured would not have been denied him, no
more than &s;he did her leave to lord chancellor to deliver the writ, when
he a&s;ked her if he &s;hould do it? I mu&s;t own to your Royal Highne&s;s, I
<PB N="602" REF="625">
am very &s;orry to &s;ee &s;uch things happen. Let the partys jar as they
plea&s;e; but let not any thing happen, by any mini&s;ter of yours, that
may be interpreted as if your illu&s;trious family wanted all the confidence
and con&s;ideration imaginable for the Queen; who, I find, by Mr, Secre|tary's

Schutz; and, if you will pardon the liberty I take, I believe nothing
could have a better effect than your and the Elector's di&s;approving what
Mon&s;. Schutz has done in this matter. As I certainly wi&s;h well to the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in your family, and de&s;ire heartily the peace and
tranquillity of my country, I can't but apprehend for both, if &s;ome ef|fectual

between the Queen and your Royal Highne&s;s's illu&s;trious family; and
that you act on both &s;ides, with the ju&s;t con&s;ideration and confidence
you ought to have for and in one another. Your Royal Highne&s;s knows
my character and opinion of partys. You know my zeal for your inte|re&s;t,
and, therefore, I hope will excu&s;e this liberty I take, to beg of you
to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly with the Elector your &s;on upon &s;ome expedient to
put matters upon a foot of reciprocal confidence in the Queen and
your illu&s;trious hou&s;e. A King or Queen of England mu&s;t govern by
the bulk of their people, and mu&s;t never be tyed to one or t'other party;
which made King William, and all the Kings his predece&s;&s;ors, change
from one to the other party, as they had the majority of the nation and
parliament; and any King or Queen who would reign with a party,
again&s;t the majority of the nation, would have but a mo&s;t unea&s;y life;
and God forbid I &s;hould live to &s;ee ever the Queen and her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors
&s;truggling to &s;upport different parties."</P>
<P>"After all the fooli&s;h and malicious outcry of the danger of the Pre|tender,
I have a&s;ked the people here, to tell me one thing done in his fa|vour,
or one thing left undone to exclude him, and to &s;ecure your
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion; nay I have de&s;ired them to let me know what was de&s;ired, or
if there could be any thing more done to &s;ecure the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
in your illu&s;trious hou&s;e, and if they would tell me, I would engage it
&s;hould be done. And upon di&s;cour&s;ing this matter t'other day with the
pen&s;ionary, he &s;eemed convinced of the truth of what I told him; and
that there was no ju&s;t grounds for this outcry about the Pretender, and
<PB N="603" REF="626">
that nothing could be of a wor&s;e con&s;equence than the project talked of
by &s;ome Whigs, of getting the Electoral Prince over, and &s;etting him
up for &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in prejudice to your's and the Elector's right. The
pen&s;ionary told me upon this, that he would go and talk roundly to that
man, pointing to baron Bothmar, who was then in the Treves-chamber,
when I was in this di&s;cour&s;e with the pen&s;ionary; and that he would af|terwards
tell me, if there was any thing the Baron could propo&s;e to be
done. He told me, after having talked to Bothmar, that all he had to
oppo&s;e was, that the Pretender was &s;uffered to continue in Lorrain. Your
Royal Highne&s;s is judge whether the Queen can oblige the duke of Lor|rain
to &s;end him from thence if he won't, and has engaged to France not
to do it; and what we can &s;ay more to France, when they an&s;wer us,
that they have punctually executed their treaty, by &s;ending him out of
France; and yet that article, in our treaty, was looked upon as a hard|&s;hip
on the French King; &s;ince even in the preliminaries, in 1709, they
did not oblige the French King &s;o &s;trongly as we had done in our treaty;
being all was &s;aid in tho&s;e preliminaries was, that whereas the Chevalier
St. George had a mind to travel, the French King con&s;ented to it."</P>

<P>"I Send you, Sir, the Examiner of this day, which makes a great noi&s;e
in town, and gives great plea&s;ure to the well-affected. The author,
who &s;ucceeded Dr. Swift, is the lord trea&s;urer's library-keeper; and none
of his papers, of which three appear every week, are printed without the
prime mini&s;ter's knowing their contents; &s;o that one may look upon this
performance as the interpretation of his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee by this piece, that the Tories are &s;o far from exclaiming
again&s;t the coming of the Electoral Prince, that they applaud it, and
pretend to have the principal &s;hare in his good graces. This we will not
envy them, providing they attach them&s;elves to him as they appear re|&s;olved
to do; and it is not to be doubted, but as &s;oon as he appears, the
lord trea&s;urer will &s;eek his protection, and both parties pay their court
to him. There is no que&s;tion, therefore, of &s;ending the prince to be the head of a party, but to have the glory of uniting the two parties, who
will concur together in parliament to &s;ettle a revenue of 30 or 40,000<HI>l.</HI>

<P>"I Entreat you to be &s;o good as to offer my very humble thanks to the
Elector, for the &s;hare he appears to take in my affliction for the
death of my daughter.</P>
<P>It is &s;o evident, that the Queen's mini&s;ters are determined to place the
Pretender on the throne, that it would be lo&s;ing one's time to produce
<PB N="606" REF="629">
proofs of it. Their greate&s;t de&s;ire, and their only view in Mr. Harley's
emba&s;&s;y, is to obtain &s;ome declaration from the Elector, which may im|po&s;e
upon the nation, and make it believe that your court is &s;atisfied
with them. If you have fallen into this &s;nare, it will render all the ef|forts
of your friends of no avail; but we rely upon the great prudence of
his Electoral Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>A more proper time for demanding the writ for the Electoral Prince
could not have been cho&s;en; for you &s;ee how many of the riche&s;t and
mo&s;t con&s;iderable among the Tories declare for you, and acknowledge
that they were deceived by the mini&s;try, who lo&s;e &s;o much ground in
both hou&s;es, that you may depend upon it, they will take care not to
call the &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion of this parliament, before they have executed their
de&s;ign in favour of the Pretender; for otherwi&s;e they will run a ri&s;k of
being pro&s;ecuted, for having betrayed their country and violated the laws;
and as they cannot ju&s;tify them&s;elves in that re&s;pect, it is not to be be|lieved,
that they will expo&s;e them&s;elves to the hazard of another &s;e&s;&s;ion;
for if they lo&s;e any more ground, however &s;mall, their ruin is certain.</P>
<P>Luckily, this &s;e&s;&s;ion is to continue for two months longer, as no &s;up|plies
are yet found; &s;o that the Electoral Prince will have time enough
before the end of it, to arrive and take his &s;eat in parliament; in which
ca&s;e the balance will incline entirely to your &s;ide, as it begins to do al|ready,
upon the mere rumour of his coming: &s;o that you may judge
what effect his pre&s;ence would produce. Accordingly our friends write
to me, that, in that ca&s;e, the parliament will not ri&s;e before they have
&s;ettled a pen&s;ion of 40,000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the prince,
who will have nothing to do but to make his court to the Queen, and
care&s;s the mini&s;ters, without meddling in any thing.</P>
<P>By this remedy the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion will be &s;ecured, without ri&s;k, without
expence, and without war; and likewi&s;e it is very probable that France,
&s;eeing her&s;elf prevented in that manner, will abandon her de&s;ign of a&s;|&s;i&s;ting
the Pretender.</P>
<P>In my humble opinion, it would be proper to u&s;e di&s;patch, and that
the prince &s;hould &s;et out before lord Paget arrives. This journey of the
Prince, attended with the &s;ucce&s;s which there is rea&s;on to expect from
it, cannot fail to give the Elector new influence, and much greater con|&s;equence
over all Europe; as he will &s;ecure to him&s;elf thereby the crown
<PB N="607" REF="630">
of Great Britain, which will attach the Emperor, Holland, and the
court of Pru&s;&s;ia to him, and render him the arbiter of the differences of
the North. Whereas, if this opportunity is lo&s;t, (which, according to
appearances, will be the la&s;t), the contrary will happen, and the influ|ence
of his Electoral Highne&s;s at other courts will &s;uffer con&s;iderably by
it, e&s;pecially after the great noi&s;e which this demand of the writ for the
Electoral Prince makes every where, which leaves no one room to doubt
of his &s;etting out &s;oon: &s;o that if he does not &s;et out at all, your friends
in England, who have expo&s;ed them&s;elves &s;o generou&s;ly for your intere&s;ts,
will be ab&s;olutely ruined, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the utmo&s;t danger, which
cannot fail to be productive of bad con&s;equences to your court, in all
the other courts of Europe.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y for your court to conceive of what importance it is, that the
Prince &s;hould arrive while the parliament is &s;itting, as the rea&s;on to ju&s;tify
his journey is the right he has to take his &s;eat in parliament, and the
writ by which the Queen calls him to it. I hope you will &s;end me good
news.</P>
<P>I believe Mr. Molineux will be now at your court. I recommend him
to you, as being a man of quality, who has very large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in
Ireland, but principally as a man of parts and of merit, with who&s;e good
principles I am well acquainted. I flatter my&s;elf that he will be well
received by their Highne&s;&s;es. I am, &amp;c."</P>
<P>"I may add further, that the Prince being but the third in the order of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and coming alone without troops, the Queen cannot be ju&s;tly
offended."</P>

<P>THEIR Electoral Highne&s;&s;es received, with the utmo&s;t gratitude,
the fre&s;h mark of kindne&s;s which the Queen gave them, when
&s;he ordered Mr. Harley to a&s;k them, what they wanted to be done for
the greater &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion e&s;tabli&s;hed in their fa|mily,
and al&s;o the obliging a&s;&s;urances he added to it, that her Britannic
Maje&s;ty would have a plea&s;ure in granting whatever they de&s;ired in that
re&s;pect.</P>
<P>It is in reliance on this, that their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es take the liberty
of repre&s;enting to her Maje&s;ty the nece&s;&s;ity of obliging the Pretender
to remove to Italy, and the danger which may re&s;ult from his &s;taying
longer in Lorrain, both to her Maje&s;ty's kingdoms and to her royal per|&s;on,
and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to be more obliged to her Maje&s;ty than their Electoral
Highne&s;&s;es are, for the in&s;tances which &s;he has been already plea&s;ed to
make for the Pretender's removal. And as the pre&s;ent parliament, as
well as the former, have &s;hewn they are per&s;uaded, that the &s;ecurity of
<PB N="609" REF="632">
the nation and of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is connected with it, which is likewi&s;e
the opinion of their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es, they entreat her Maje&s;ty to take
mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for attaining &s;uch a &s;alutary end; and the more
&s;o, the Pretender's adherents publi&s;h, with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;urance, that he
is preparing to make a de&s;cent in the North of Great Britain, while the
kingdom is unfurni&s;hed with a fleet and troops; which is confirmed by
different advices received from per&s;ons who have been lately at Bar-le|duc,
and have a &s;hare of the Pretender's confidence, and who affirm that
he will begin very &s;oon to execute his enterpri&s;e, and that he depends upon
a powerful foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>"Affairs being in &s;uch a dangerous &s;ituation, their Electoral High|ne&s;&s;es
hope, that her Maje&s;ty will own with them, that it is nece&s;&s;ary for
the &s;ecurity of her royal per&s;on, and for that of her kingdoms, and of
the prote&s;tant religion, to &s;ettle in Great Britain &s;ome one of the Elec|toral
family, who would be attentive to &s;uch important concerns, and
&s;hew her Maje&s;ty, by a fidelity and an inviolable attachment to her per|&s;on,
how much their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es are filled with re&s;pect and
gratitude towards her. The time appears to be now come, when the
&s;ecurity of their common intere&s;ts cannot be found any longer but in a
reciprocal confidence, and in mea&s;ures taken with perfect concert; and
when their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es, as they do not expect the &s;ecurity of
their rights to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but from the continuance of her Maje&s;ty's
goodne&s;s, are ready to contribute, on their &s;ide, as much as is in their
power, to defeat the de&s;igns of tho&s;e who would choo&s;e to di&s;turb the
tranquillity and felicity of her glorious reign.</P>
<P>"Their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es likewi&s;e take the liberty of renewing the
in&s;tances they made near two years ago, to her Maje&s;ty and to her mi|ni&s;ters,
for a&s;king that &s;uch a pen&s;ion and e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould be &s;ettled
by act of parliament on her Highne&s;s the Electre&s;s, as the neare&s;t heir to
the crown u&s;ually enjoyed. Their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es did not choo&s;e

with the expences of the war; but the&s;e expences being di&s;continued,

<P>"I Have opened your pacquet for the Baron de Schutz, which ar|rived
by the ye&s;terday's po&s;t, and &s;ent it afterwards to Kreyen|berg,

flatter them&s;elves that the prince will &s;et out on his journey as &s;oon as
Mon&s;. de Schutz arrives at Hannover. They think this ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
and that without it the Pretender will be here &s;oon, and be very

<P>BOTH Whigs and Tories pre&s;&s;ed Kreyenberg to repre&s;ent the ab&s;o|lute
nece&s;&s;ity of the prince's coming over, after the &s;tep which had
been taken. "The Queen," &s;ays he, "will at la&s;t reconcile her&s;elf to
it, and the mini&s;ters, at lea&s;t the greate&s;t number of them, will pay
their court to him. Angle&s;ea, Abington, Orrery, and Sir Thomas
Hanmer declared, without being de&s;ired, that before the end of the &s;e&s;|&s;ion,
the parliament will make &s;uch a &s;ettlement for him as the Queen
had when &s;he was prince&s;s."</P>
<P>Kreyenberg was convinced that the Queen and mini&s;try would agree
to every thing that could be a&s;ked of them, if the prince did not come
over, and would perhaps &s;acrifice Bolingbroke, and turn others out of
the mini&s;try: but he thought that would be done merely to amu&s;e the
Elector until the parliament ro&s;e.</P>
<P>"The Queen &s;ent for the archbi&s;hop of York, and made him the
greate&s;t prote&s;tations, founded on con&s;cience and &s;entiments of religion,
that &s;he was &s;incerely for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This prelate cannot
reconcile all this with what he him&s;elf and every one &s;ees. She &s;aid no|thing
at all of the coming of the Electoral Prince, but only of the di&s;|obliging
manner in which the writ was demanded."</P>
<P>"It is confidently &s;aid now, and it appears very probable, that lord
Oxford has carried his point with the Queen, and is become prime mi|ni&s;ter.
It is believed that the affair of the writ contributed not a little to
this; as his lord&s;hip in&s;inuated, with great addre&s;s, that lord Boling|broke's
violent conduct induced the Elector to take that &s;tep."</P>
<P>In the news which was &s;ent this po&s;t in cyphers by Galke to Bothmar,
we have the following pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>"Mr. John&s;ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 404.</NOTE> who was formerly &s;ecretary of &s;tate in Scotland,
told l'Hermitage, that the plan was formed for bringing in the Preten|der;
but that it was communicated only to four per&s;ons. He dined that
day with lord Mar, who married his niece. He &s;aid that he would go
in three weeks to Spa; and that, as he pa&s;&s;ed through the Hague, he
<PB N="613" REF="636">
would di&s;cover very important &s;ecrets to Mon&s;. de Bothmar. He added,
that the coming of the Electoral Prince would remedy every thing; that
even the mini&s;ters, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, would pay court to him; and
that there was no other remedy for &s;aving the nation and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
but that it mu&s;t be applied without delay, and before the end of the
parliament."</P>
<P>"They give out at court, that it is not the affair of the writ, but the
manner of a&s;king it, which di&s;plea&s;ed the Queen; and for that rea&s;on
they affect to &s;hew a thou&s;and civilities to Kreyenberg, who has been
two following times invited to dine with the L&mdash;d T&mdash;r, who is
more than ever in credit with the Queen, and appears di&s;po&s;ed to attach
him&s;elf to the prince, as &s;oon as he appears, in order to gain him her
Maje&s;ty's good graces, and to overturn Bolingbroke."</P>

<P>"THE Queen's conver&s;ation with the archbi&s;hop of York, of which
Kreyenberg will have informed you, begins to make great noi&s;e.
It is confirmed now, that the Lord Trea&s;urer is more in favour with the
Queen than ever he was. Bolingbroke is enraged at this, and it is not
doubted but he will take his mea&s;ures upon it in a manner &s;uitable to his
humour.</P>
<P>"L'Hermitage told me to-day, that lord Portmore employs all ima|ginable
per&s;ua&s;ions to in&s;pire the duke of Ormond, who is more firm
than ever in the intere&s;ts of the Pretender, with more favourable &s;enti|ments
towards the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but that he has not been able yet, to
make great progre&s;s, his Grace being con&s;tantly be&s;et by three women,
who are lady Ogletorp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He means Lady Oglethorpe.</NOTE> and two others, who will overturn to-morrow

<P>"IF I did my&s;elf the honour of writing to you &s;o &s;eldom &s;ince I have
been here, it was to &s;ave you the repetition of the &s;ame news which
you received from the baron de Schutz and Mon&s;. Kreyenberg; but now,
when every thing is at &s;take, and when our &s;afety, and the &s;ecurity of
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion depend entirely upon the journey of the Electoral Prince,
I con&s;ider it is my duty to repre&s;ent to you, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner I am
able, that if his Highne&s;s's journey is put off, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is inevitably
lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="615" REF="638">
"One may &s;ay, that the whole nation expects the prince now with
the utmo&s;t impatience, and that there is &s;uch a general di&s;po&s;ition to re|ceive
him well, that the mini&s;ters will be obliged to treat his Highne&s;s
with the re&s;pect which is due to him. But if the opportunity is lo&s;t,
this inclination may cool; they will think them&s;elves neglected, and will
be capable, perhaps, of going from one extreme into another.</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly the rea&s;ons for the prince's journey become every day
more &s;trong; you know them, Sir, better than any man; therefore I
&s;hall only &s;ay, that all the Tories, excepting &s;uch as are entirely devoted
to the mini&s;ters, wi&s;h for the Prince's arrival with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as
the Whigs; and there is rea&s;on to fear, that if the re&s;olution of &s;ending
him is changed, our new allies, lord Angle&s;ea, the archbi&s;hop of York,
and the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons, with their friends, will leave
us &s;oon: for they declare publickly enough, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion cannot
be &s;ecured but by the pre&s;ence of the prince; and they in&s;inuated, that
if he does not come, they will be obliged to take other mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>"You would &s;ee by the Gazettes, that the &s;tocks ro&s;e very high &s;ince
the Prince's journey was &s;poke of; an undoubted &s;ign of the good di&s;po|&s;ition
of the nation; and, I think, I may a&s;&s;ure you, that his pre&s;ence
here will give us immediately a majority in both hou&s;es. The Tories
do not conceal their &s;entiments in this re&s;pect, and they &s;ay publickly,
that they only wait to &s;ee the Prince for declaring, again&s;t the mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>"The lord trea&s;urer and lord Bolingbroke are more exa&s;perated than
ever again&s;t one another. The lord trea&s;urer found means of reconciling
him&s;elf with lady Ma&s;ham, and boa&s;ts that he will very &s;oon turn out
lord Bolingbroke, and the lord chancellor; and the trea&s;urer's friends
begin, by private rumours, to charge the&s;e two noblemen with the de|&s;ign
of bringing in the Pretender. In a word, this is a fine opportunity
for bringing over the Prince; and the mini&s;ters being come to an open
rupture with one another, the parliament and the people are impatient
to &s;ee him arrive, and the parti&s;ans of the Pretender cannot di&s;gui&s;e their
apprehen&s;ions of this journey, which they con&s;ider as a mortal blow, to
all their de&s;igns."</P>

<P>"I Did my&s;elf the honour of writing to you the 4th in&s;tant, that I
would communicate, without delay, to the court of Hannover, the
letter which you was &s;o good as to write to me the 25th of April. I have
done &s;o; and I have had the plea&s;ure to under&s;tand, that the a&s;&s;urances
of your good intentions and of your attachment to the intere&s;ts of the
illu&s;trious family, gave great joy at that court, and that they de&s;ire to
live in perfect confidence with you.</P>
<P>With regard to the Electoral Prince's journey; I am charged to tell
you, my lord, that when the Queen gave the prince the patent of duke
of Cambridge, and regulated the rank of the Prote&s;tant princes of the
family, as princes of the blood, by the act of precedency, which was
carried to them two years ago, by Mr. Harley, that court imagined the&s;e
were real favours, of which they might make u&s;e when the opportunity
offered, and that the Electoral Prince, when he made u&s;e of his writ of
&s;ummons, only made u&s;e of what was his right, and that, if he went to
England, it would be with an intention to continue inviolably attached
to the Queen and to her mini&s;ters, and to your lord&s;hip in particular;
wherein her Britannic Maje&s;ty would find her own &s;afety and that of her
kingdoms again&s;t the attempts of the Pretender, who would not dare,
in that ca&s;e, to think of an inva&s;ion. Be&s;ides that, the King of France
would have this rea&s;on to allege for di&s;pen&s;ing him&s;elf from a&s;&s;i&s;ting
him, that there would be no means of doing it, as the family of Hanno|ver
was beforehand with him: &s;o that nothing appears more conformed
to the intere&s;t of the Queen and the nation, than the &s;ending over the
prince, which is evident, as the Jacobites fear it, as a mortal blow to
their hopes.</P>
<P>I hope, my lord, that you will have no difficulty of conceiving the
Elector's views, and I pray God, with all my heart, that the mea&s;ures
taken to &s;ecure the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion to the crown of Great Britain
may &s;ucceed, per&s;uaded as I am, that the pre&s;ervation of our holy reli|gion
and the &s;afety of Europe depend upon it. Your lord&s;hip is in a
&s;ituation which enables you to procure &s;o great a benefit, by uniting, &s;till
more clearly, the Queen with the family of Hannover. In the name of
<PB N="617" REF="640">
God, my lord, employ your influence and your prudence to promote this
falutary end. You will gain the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, and the applau&s;e of
all hone&s;t men.</P>
<P>If you think that I can be &s;erviceable to you in any thing, you will do
me a favour and a plea&s;ure by employing me. I &s;hall always &s;hew that I
have nothing more at heart, than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion,
and the union of the two nations; and on all occa&s;ions, I &s;hall give
you marks of the zeal and re&s;pect with which I have the honour to be, my

<P>"THE Pretender's faction acknowledge that if the prince comes
over, their &s;y&s;tem's over-turned, and they invent lyes of every
kind, to de&s;troy all hopes of the prince's coming, producing letters from
Hannover, which bear that Mon&s;ieur de Schutz has been di&s;avowed and
very ill received, and that it is certain the Elector will not &s;end the prince
to England.</P>
<P>Mr. Bromley, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in particular, &s;poke in this manner,
which has thrown the Pretender's faction into tran&s;ports of joy, and the
friends of Hannover, both Whigs and Tories, into the utmo&s;t de&s;pair.
I have heard &s;everal of them, and among others, the duke of Argyle ex|claim,
if the Elector abandons us in this manner, and refu&s;es to embrace
an opportunity &s;o favourable, &s;o ea&s;y, and &s;o conformed to our laws,
&s;acrificing us, and abandoning us to the rage of our enemies, after all
that we have done for him, we have no further recour&s;e, but to go to the
other extremity, and invite the Pretender to come over on tolerable terms,
and without a French army.</P>
<P>I entreat your Excellency to communicate this to his Electoral High|ne&s;s.
Con&s;ider what advantage the Pretender's friends will draw from it,
and if, your friends being refu&s;ed and di&s;gu&s;ted, it will not be very ea&s;y
for your enemies to carry any bill they plea&s;e. in parliament, for infring|ing
the acts of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which they have attempted before now
&s;everal times, but without &s;ucce&s;s. The boldne&s;s of the&s;e people goes &s;o
far, that Sir John Packington, in a club of more than 80 Tories,
propo&s;ed that the parliament &s;hould order, the black box to be opened;
&s;o they call the &s;ealed in&s;truments of the Electre&s;s, appointing a regency
in ca&s;e of the Queen's death; but the affair was dropped.</P>
<P>This and &s;ome things &s;till wor&s;e, will be brought now again upon the
carpet, if the prince does not come, for then your enemies will rea&s;&s;ume
courage; and &s;eeing that your court &s;hews no re&s;entment of the affront
done to your Mini&s;ter, they will imagine, as you put up with every
thing, that every thing is allowable to them.</P>
<P><PB N="619" REF="642">
The pardon which the Queen granted to Doctor Bedford, author of
the bock on Hereditary Right, is the greate&s;t affront which her Maje&s;ty
could offer to the Electoral family. I don't know if the&s;e things are
under&s;tood at your court, or if attention is paid to them.</P>
<P>They continue to di&s;mi&s;s all the officers, civil and military, who pre|&s;ume
to &s;hew any attachment to the Hannoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and yet
they give out, that the Queen's mini&s;ters a&s;&s;ure your court that they
have the greate&s;t zeal and attachment to them. It would be very curi|ous
if they could &s;ucceed to per&s;uade you of this.</P>
<P>My conclu&s;ion from all this is, that if the prince does not come over,
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is lo&s;t. The delaying his journey has had already the bad
effects I apprehended from it, having given time to the mini&s;ters to con|trive
new intrigues, and give life and courage to their party, which was
half extinct, and which laughs now at your friends every where, and a&s;ks
them, Where is then your duke of Cambridge? And where is your &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion?

them change their language &s;oon.</P>

The quarrels between the trea&s;urer and Bolingbroke are greater than

two, but they quarrel more violently afterwards. The parti&s;ans of both
the one and the other give out, that their leader po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the favour

on this &s;ubject, this &s;cene at court having lately changed as fre|quently
as the wind. The fact is, that the&s;e two mini&s;ters exert them&s;elves
very openly, to ruin one another, and as this divi&s;ion among the leaders
reigns al&s;o among their followers, it is very certain, that if the Electoral
Prince comes over, both of them will be very &s;oon overturned; to which
I may add, that at bottom, the trea&s;urer would not be &s;orry that the
Electoral Prince were here, although he is obliged to declare and to
publi&s;h the contrary, for fear of lo&s;ing entirely the Queen, who cannot

<P>What I write to you of the real &s;entiments of the trea&s;urer, concerning
this affair, comes from his brother the auditor, who told it to general
Erle, from whom I had it. The trea&s;urer has likewi&s;e commanded &s;e|veral
&s;ecret negociations with the Whigs, &s;ince his credit has begun to
decline at court; and they have an&s;wered, that in ca&s;e he will con&s;ent to
the coming of the Electoral Prince, and exert him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;ecure
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, they will not only forget the pa&s;t, but they will
endeavour to &s;upport him and to maintain him in his authority and in
his office.</P>
<P>I imagine, Sir, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to act in a more di&s;intere&s;ted man|ner
than the Whigs do; and I am almo&s;t per&s;uaded, that the pre&s;ence of
the Electoral Prince will determine the trea&s;urer to adopt that plan.</P>
<P>I &s;hall expect, with great impatience to hear from you, and you may
write by the u&s;ual conveyance in the cypher which you gave me. I
make no u&s;e of it in this letter, becau&s;e I &s;end it by a lady who will deli|ver

<P>"AS the rumour increa&s;es, that my cou&s;in, the Electoral Prince, has
re&s;olved to come over to &s;ettle, in my life time, in my dominions
I do not choo&s;e to delay a moment to write to you about this, and to
communicate to you my &s;entiments, upon a &s;ubject of this importance.</P>
<P>I then freely own to you, that I cannot imagine, that a prince who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
the knowledge and penetration of your Electoral Highne&s;s, can
ever contribute to &s;uch an attempt; and that I believe you are too ju&s;t to
allow, that any infringement &s;hall be made on my &s;overeignty which you
would not choo&s;e &s;hould be made on your own. I am firmly per&s;uaded,
that you would not &s;uffer the &s;malle&s;t diminution of your authority: I
am no le&s;s delicate, in that re&s;pect; and I am determined to oppo&s;e a
project &s;o contrary to my royal authority, however fatal the con&s;equences
may be.</P>
<P>Your Electoral Highne&s;s is too ju&s;t to refu&s;e to bear me witne&s;s, that
I gave, on all occa&s;ions, proofs of my de&s;ire that your family &s;hould &s;uc|ceed
to my crowns; which I always recommend to my people, as the
mo&s;t &s;olid &s;upport of their religion and their laws. I employ all my at|tentions,
that nothing &s;hould efface tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions from the hearts of
my &s;ubjects: but it is not po&s;&s;ible to derogate from the dignity and pre|rogatives
of the prince who wears the crown, without making a dangerous
breach on the rights of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; therefore, I doubt not, but with
your u&s;ual wi&s;dom, you will prevent the taking &s;uch a &s;tep; and that you
will give me an opportunity of renewing to you, a&s;&s;urances of the mo&s;t
&s;incere friend&s;hip with which I am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>"IT is likely that the chevalier de St. George is preparing for &s;ome
great de&s;ign which is kept very private. It was believed that he
would drink the waters of Plombiere for three weeks, as is cu&s;tomary,
and that he would come afterwards, to pa&s;s 15 days at Luneville; but
he changed his mea&s;ures: he did not continue to drink the waters, which
he drank only for 10 days, and came back to Luneville Saturday la&s;t.
He &s;ets out to-morrow very early for Bar; lord Galmoy went before
him, and &s;et out this morning. Lord Talmo, who came lately from
France, is with him, and &s;ome &s;ay, that the duke of Berwick is incog|nito
in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The chevalier appears pen&s;ive: that, indeed, is his ordinary humour.
Mr. Floyd, who has been the&s;e five days at the court of his Royal High|ne&s;s,
told a mi&s;tre&s;s he has here, that when he leaves her now, he will
take his leave of her, perhaps, for the la&s;t time. In &s;hort, it is certain,
that every thing here &s;eems &s;ufficiently to anounce preparations for a
journey; it is &s;aid likewi&s;e, in private, that the chevalier has had let|ters
that the Queen is very ill.</P>
<P>I have done every thing I could to di&s;cover &s;omething of his de&s;igns.
I &s;upped la&s;t night with &s;everal of his attendants, thinking to learn &s;ome|thing;
but they avoid to explain them&s;elves. They only &s;ay, that
the chevalier did not find him&s;elf the better of drinking the waters, that
he would go now to repo&s;e him&s;elf for &s;ome time, at Bar, until he goes,
in the beginning of next month, to the Prince de Vaudemont's, at Com|merci,
where their Royal Highne&s;&s;es will come likewi&s;e. They &s;ay,
they do not know yet, if they will remain in this country or not; that
they will follow the de&s;tiny of the chevalier; and that it is not known
yet what it &s;hall be."</P>

<P>"YOUR letters leave me in an uncertainty whether the Electoral
Prince will come or not. Here they begin to believe the la&s;t. I
made no u&s;e of the rea&s;on which you give me, why the Elector has not come
to a determination, that is to &s;ay, the i&s;&s;ue of the Queen's &s;ickne&s;s, as
they would &s;ay, it is only a pretence. The Queen's dangerous &s;ituation,
they would &s;ay, ought to determine you &s;o much the &s;ooner. In &s;hort,
I do not know what to &s;ay to all this, and I don't believe you expect from
me that I &s;hould foretell what may be the con&s;equence. We mu&s;t wait a
few days to &s;ee more clearly.</P>
<P>All I can &s;ay at pre&s;ent is, that our friends are much dejected and di&s;|couraged.
Some of them, as Sir Thomas Hanmer and others of his
party, intimate, that as this affair has &s;pun out &s;o long, and as the court
has had time to recollect it&s;elf and concert its mea&s;ures, it would be more
proper, in &s;uch a &s;tate of things, to wait for the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parlia|ment,
and to &s;ee, in the mean time, what can be done. I own I cannot
agree with them in this, and all our other friends likewi&s;e, as Notting|ham,
Town&s;hend, Sunderland, Halifax, &amp;c. continue in their old opinion.
But they all in general think, that if the Elector does not choo&s;e to &s;end
the Electoral Prince, it would have been proper and will be proper &s;till
to declare &s;o, in order that the Elector on the one hand, may take advan|tage
of it at this court, and that our friends on the other, may con&s;ider
of &s;omething el&s;e, and of the conduct they are to follow, to keep up the

<P>1&s;t, Becau&s;e he is a &s;elfi&s;h and pre&s;umptuous fool, and a fool to &s;uch

in order to repre&s;ent her Maje&s;ty, to dre&s;s him&s;elf as a woman, which he
actually did.</P>
<P>2dly, Becau&s;e the changing lord Paget for this fool Clarendon, having
been brought about without lord Oxford's knowledge, &s;hows that Boling|broke
has acquired a &s;uperiority, as Kreyenberg writes.</P>
<P>Oxford employed Kreyenberg to make me great compliments in return

me, that he will cultivate a &s;incere and true friend&s;hip with me, if I
choo&s;e to return it. This is likewi&s;e a proof to me that he finds him&s;elf
falling. I &s;hall make the mo&s;t obliging an&s;wers to him, and will endea|vour

<P>HE had paid &s;everal vi&s;its, and found none of the mini&s;ters at home
but the lord trea&s;urer and Mr. Bromley.&mdash;"I am ju&s;t returned from

and &s;eems to be in health, excepting that &s;he cannot walk, nor &s;tand up.</P>
<P>I was told here, that it is not lord Middleton him&s;elf, but his &s;on, who
went to Vienna; and it mu&s;t be certainly for a different purpo&s;e from
travelling, as he conceals him&s;elf there in a convent."</P>
<P>&mdash;6/17 July.&mdash;Bromley &s;poke to Bothmar of the publication of the
Queen's letters to the Electre&s;s and to the Electoral Prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 128.</NOTE>. It was &s;u&s;|pected
by &s;ome that Bothmar publi&s;hed them, but he convinced them
that he did not. Tho&s;e who were for the Prince's coming over, were an|gry
at the publication of the letters, as it might produce bad effects
among the people, who would &s;ee by it, that the Queen had &s;o much
aver&s;ion from a prince of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The mini&s;try continued to be
on bad terms.</P>
<P>&mdash;9/20 July.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>&mdash;"It is true the trea&s;urer receives me very well;
but the que&s;tion is, if he is &s;incere, and if he will &s;till have power to
&s;erve us. He deceived the Whigs, and perhaps him&s;elf. It is thought
he has patched up matters with Bolingbroke. I &s;hall write to you about
this by a &s;ecret addre&s;s."</P>
<P>The letter, which Bothmar promi&s;ed to &s;end by a &s;ecret addre&s;s, was
written in cyphers; the copy of it which follows, is in Robethon's hand.</P>
<P>"It was believed that the examination of the treaty of commerce with
Spain would have given an opportunity of making Bolingbroke fall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> if
<PB N="634" REF="657">
the trea&s;urer, with his friends, had joined tho&s;e who wanted to overturn
his antagoni&s;t. He had promi&s;ed it by his brother, through whom a&s;|&s;urances
had been given him, that on that condition, they would &s;upport
him again&s;t Bolingbroke. But it &s;eems they dared not attack the latter
directly, &s;eeing them&s;elves uncertain of the trea&s;urer and of his friends,
while Bolingbroke endeavoured to gain lord Angle&s;ea, Lord Abington,
and &s;ome others to his &s;ide. At la&s;t they contented them&s;elves with at|tacking
only his friend Arthur More; &s;o that lord Bolingbroke will
maintain him&s;elf in his po&s;t, and may be able to turn out the trea&s;urer
by his credit with the Queen. The fall of the trea&s;urer appears to be
very near, according to the opinion of his own friends. Some of tho&s;e
who would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to bring down his rival, &s;ay now, according
to the maxim which prevails much here, that he does not de&s;erve to be
a&s;&s;i&s;ted, as he does not choo&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons of his conduct in this &s;ituation of affairs are perhaps,
1. His own humour, which does not allow him to keep him&s;elf entirely
to one &s;ide. 2. The hopes of maintaining him&s;elf &s;till in the Queen's
good graces, by the &s;ame means, by which he introduced him&s;elf into
her favour. 3. The hopes of entering again into favour, by degrees,
although he &s;hould now lo&s;e his employment, providing he does not de|clare
openly again&s;t the court party. 4. That he is engaged &s;o deeply in
certain projects with lord Bolingbroke, that he dares not attack him
openly, for fear of being involved in his ruin; probably, all the&s;e rea&s;ons
contribute to influence his conduct.</P>
<P>He &s;eems, however, to reckon upon the good graces of the Elector, and
to be inclined to pay attention to them, which Bolingbroke thinks in|compatible
with the &s;ervice of the Queen; from which one might con|clude
what are his intentions, although they were not otherwi&s;e known.
We may be &s;ure he will proceed rapidly, if the direction of affairs falls
into his hands. It is &s;aid now, that he wants to continue &s;ecretary of
&s;tate; but that Bromley will be turned out, and Sir William Wyndham
put in his place. That the trea&s;ury will be put in commi&s;&s;ion. That
lord Angle&s;ea will be the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of it, and have alone the
vice-trea&s;urer&s;hip of Ireland, which he &s;hared till now with lord Ro|che&s;ter;
and that Shrew&s;bury will continue lord lieutenant of Ireland,
from whence they would infer that he will abandon the trea&s;urer to
<PB N="635" REF="658">
unite him&s;elf with Bolingbroke, although others do not believe this on
account of the irreconcileable difference in their tempers."</P>
<P>&mdash;July 13/24.&mdash;The letter in Bothmar's hand of this date contains
nothing material;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover papers, vol. marked Bothmar x. No. 128.</NOTE> but the copy in Robethon's hand, of what Bothmar
wrote to him in cyphers, contains the following particulars about the
quarrel of the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>"It is thought that a reconciliation is made by the mediation of their
friends; but that Bolingbroke has always mo&s;t credit with the Queen.
They &s;ay, that not only the favourite but the dutche&s;s of Shrew&s;bury is
&s;ecretly for him, by the per&s;ua&s;ions of her daughter, who is married to
Sir William Wyndham.</P>
<P>The&s;e two mini&s;ters have been for a long time on bad terms, from
the oppo&s;ition of their tempers and manners. But what gave occa&s;ion to
complete their diffidence of one another and their di&s;union, is a project
which had been formed, of dividing in 16 &s;hares the profits which the
Queen was to have from the trade to the South-&s;ea, of which five were
de&s;igned for the trea&s;urer, five for Bolingbroke, four for lady Ma&s;ham,
and two for Arthur More. The trea&s;urer having had his rea&s;ons for re|fu&s;ing
the &s;hare de&s;tined for him, was &s;u&s;pected on that account, and at
la&s;t became odious to the other &s;harers. He afterwards furni&s;hed their
enemies with means of di&s;covering this my&s;tery, which gave them occa|&s;ion
to examine the treaty of commerce without producing the effect
which they promi&s;ed them&s;elves from it, as the trea&s;urer did not furni&s;h
them with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they expected from him, and as the proroga|tion
of the parliament put an end too &s;oon to the deliberations on that
affair.</P>
<P>The Queen's an&s;wer to the addre&s;s of the lords, at which they are &s;o
much offended, is a&s;cribed to Bolingbroke. Lord Angle&s;ea is particu|larly
offended, having been the author of the addre&s;s, to which the Queen
gave that an&s;wer, and if her Maje&s;ty had not interrupted the debates by
her pre&s;ence, matters, according to all appearances, would have been
pu&s;hed very far in the animo&s;ity of all the hou&s;e of peers again&s;t Boling|broke
and again&s;t her Maje&s;ty's an&s;wer. His lord&s;hip, they affirm, will
be pro&s;ecuted vigorou&s;ly in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion; but as he apprehends this
him&s;elf, it is feared he will bring over the Pretender before that time, to
<PB N="636" REF="659">
&s;ave him&s;elf and to fini&s;h his grand &s;cheme, from which he expects the
completion of the fortune which his ambition promi&s;es him.</P>
<P>They a&s;cribe to him likewi&s;e the Queen's &s;peech; others believe it was
compo&s;ed by the chancellor Harcourt. It di&s;plea&s;es people here in many
pa&s;&s;ages; they are per&s;uaded that the la&s;t article reflects on the Prote&s;|tant
Succe&s;&s;ion, and on the intention of having one of our princes in this
country."</P>
<P>&mdash;July 16/27.&mdash;Bothmar having mentioned the quarrels of the mi|ni&s;try
adds:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Bothmar, 10. No. 128.</NOTE> "It is &s;urpri&s;ing, that the duke of Marlborough comes
over at &s;uch a cri&s;is, and does not rather wait until it is &s;een which of the
two competitors will carry it with the Queen; lord Sunderland him&s;elf
does not comprehend this. I am told he will be the day after to-mor|row
at O&s;tend, in order to embark there for this country. Cadogan has
been for eight or ten days in the country. He is expected back this even|ing.
He &s;aid when he went away, that the duke of Marlborough
would wait for him at Antwerp. The impetuo&s;ity of the dutche&s;s has
probably precipitated this journey."</P>
<P>There is a copy in Robethon's hand, of what Bothmar wrote, by this
po&s;t, in cyphers. He &s;ays the reconciliation of the mini&s;try could not
be durable. Their quarrels continued, and he found it very difficult to
&s;peak with them. His friends di&s;&s;uaded him from pre&s;&s;ing them to an
alliance with the Emperor and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia for quaranteeing the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, le&s;t they &s;hould afterwards think that the parliament demand|ed
it of the Queen, at the in&s;tigation of the Elector. His friends like|wi&s;e
advi&s;ed him not to a&s;k, at this time, Engli&s;h titles for the prince of
the Electoral family, as that might be delayed without any inconveniency
until the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament.</P>
<P>"Lord Halifax," continues Bothmar, "thinks that the Elector &s;hould
have the title of prince of Wales, and that very little time is nece&s;&s;ary to
prepare the way for that. They are &s;urpri&s;ed that the duke of Marlborough
is in a hurry to come here at this juncture. If he adheres to his old
friends, he will run a ri&s;k with the mini&s;try; and if he wants to plea&s;e
the latter, he will be abandoned by the former, without gaining much
upon the court. It is thought that the trea&s;urer has led him into this
&s;tep, by the means of Cadogan; and that, at length, he will find him&s;elf
&s;hifted off, as his old friends were, to whom the trea&s;urer had promi&s;ed

<P>&mdash;July 20/31.&mdash;"I &s;ee by what you tell me of the King of Sweden,
that his return from Turkey will not be &s;o &s;oon. It &s;eems to me, that his
mini&s;ter here flatters him&s;elf with a real a&s;&s;i&s;tance from this court. I don't
&s;ee, however, that things are yet di&s;po&s;ed for that. It is &s;aid he has hopes
from Bolingbroke, and wi&s;hes the Pretender were here already."</P>

that neither of them would accept."</P>
<P>&mdash;30 July,/10 Augu&s;t,&mdash;"I am very curious to know if there is any founda|tion

his Electoral Highne&s;s, and to Mr. de Bern&s;dorf, entreating you to in|form
me in what manner they con&s;ider this affair. I don't recollect
it was to you or to his Electoral Highne&s;s him&s;elf, that I gave an account
of the communication of a letter, by an unknown per&s;on, to the duke of
<PB N="638" REF="661">
Marlborough, of which I &s;peak in the &s;ame po&s;t&s;cript; perhaps, that the
per&s;on who wrote to him that letter, has al&s;o forged an an&s;wer to it.
That letter con&s;i&s;ts in great rea&s;oning on the weak &s;tate of the Prote&s;tant
Succe&s;&s;ion, and on the advantages which the duke might find in embrac|ing
the part of the Pretender without running any ri&s;k.</P>
<P>I imagine they begin to rea&s;on much in the &s;ame manner at Vienna,
believing that our party is much weaker here, than it is in reality, and
that we will weaken it by our indifference, and that on that account, they
ought not to offend our competitor, by too much oppo&s;ition to him, who
can the more ea&s;ily mount the throne here, that we are indifferent about
it. I write that it would be proper to undeceive the court of Vienna of
this mi&s;taken opinion."</P>
<P>"P. S. This in&s;tant, at half an hour after nine, the duke of Grafton
coming from Ken&s;ington, tells me, that all the phy&s;icians can do to make

up or down, and that they believe &s;he will not live out the night. I

affairs was now changed: they began to wear
a more favourable appearance, and would go on according to their mo&s;t

ardent wi&s;hes, providing the king came over &s;oon. His pre&s;ence would
prevent any di&s;turbances, even in Scotland, where they were apprehended.
He &s;ent the King a letter from the duke of Shrew&s;bury, who wanted to
be chamberlain, and would re&s;ign his place in the Trea&s;ury and the lord
lieutenancy of Ireland, which Bothmar propo&s;ed fir&s;t &s;hould be given to
the duke of Ormond, when the duke of Marlborough got the command
of the army. But he thought afterwards, it would be better to place the
duke of Ormond at the head of the prince of Wales's hou&s;ehold, as be|ing
fitter for a court than for any other employment, and to make Sun|derland
lord lieutenant, and Stanhope commander in chief in Ireland. Or|mond
could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without his pen&s;ion. Sunderland &s;hewed always,
and continued to &s;hew more attachment to the King than any other.</P>
<P>&mdash;Augu&s;t 6th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Mi&s;|cel. d'Etat. No. 1.</NOTE> O. S. Bothmar, in a letter to Baron Bern&s;dorff of
this date, mentions Mr. Steel's &s;ervices to the family of Hannover, and
recommends Dr. Hill for the bi&s;hoprick of Ely, the duke of St. Albans
to be captain of the band of gentlemen pen&s;ioners, lord Halifax to be
fir&s;t lord of the Trea&s;ury, Mr. Boyle and Mr. Walpole to be his col|leagues,
and lord Orford to be fir&s;t lord of the Admiralty, in the room of
lord Strafford, "who knew nothing about the bu&s;ine&s;s. The duke of
Marlborough came to town ye&s;terday, amid&s;t the acclamations of the
people, as if he had gained another battle at Hoch&s;tet. He will be of
great &s;ervice, if the Pretender makes any attempt. He is not plea&s;ed,
that he is not of the regency, and that there is any man but the King
higher than him in this country."</P>
<P>Bothmar recommended to allow Shrew&s;bury to retire, to &s;atisfy Marl|borough
and Sunderland, to provide for Stanhope and Cadogan, and then
to think of doing &s;omething for lord Somers.</P>
<P>Kreyenberg wrote to Robethon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 9.</NOTE> in a letter of this date, that the King
had been proclaimed very quietly over all England, and that they ex|pected
to hear he had been proclaimed in the &s;ame manner in Scotland
and in Ireland: that it was thought the Jacobites would not &s;tir, unle&s;s
they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by France; and that the French amba&s;&s;ador declared
his ma&s;ter was determins to ob&s;erve the Treaty of Utrecht.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 10th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 1</NOTE> O. S. Bothmar, in a letter to Baron Bern&s;dorff of this
date, acquaints him, that things go on very quietly in England. The
<PB N="641" REF="666">
King has been proclaimed very quietly at Edinburgh, and probably will
be &s;o likewi&s;e in Ireland, where &s;ome propo&s;e to &s;end general Stanhope,
while others think he will be made more u&s;eful in the Engli&s;h parliament.
He recommends to deprive lord North and Gray of the government
of Port&s;mouth, and to give it to general Erle, and to make this change
before the King's arrival. He hopes the hou&s;e of commons will grant the
King for life the &s;ame civil li&s;t they gave the Queen, and that the en&s;uing
parliament will augment it on account of the Prince's family. He for|wards
a letter to the King, from lord Manche&s;ter, who had been amba&s;&s;ador
in France and at Venice, and &s;ecretary of &s;tate at home, and now
begs only to be made a gentleman of the King's bed-chamber; a favour
which Bothmar recommends to grant to him; but he propo&s;es that no
an&s;wer &s;hould be given to his lady, who wants to be one of the Prince&s;s's
maids of honour. He recommends brigadiers Honnywood and Dormer
to be made grooms of the bed-chamber; the la&s;t having been recom|mended
by the duke of Marlborough. He thinks it will be &s;ufficient
now to give general promi&s;es to &s;uch as a&s;k favours, and to fulfil them
when the King has formed his plan. "He may then turn out in general
all the late Queen's court and council."</P>
<P>He writes to Robethon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Mi&s;|cell. d'Etat. No. 10.</NOTE> of the &s;ame date, that a great change had hap|pened,
by the King's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of the&s;e kingdoms; and that
things go on very favourably for his Maje&s;ty. It is reported that they
are arming and preparing tran&s;ports in France. This is not probable;
but preparations are made to guard again&s;t it, and 15 &s;hips will be
&s;oon ready. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that Mr. Prior &s;ends no intelligence of the&s;e
things from France, and that lie writes in cyphers things which he might
very &s;afely write plain. Some members of the regency &s;u&s;pect that let|ters
are concealed from them.</P>

<P>THE archbi&s;hop of York and Sir Thomas Hanmer recommended Dr.
Hill to Bothmar for the bi&s;hoprick of Ely;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 1.</NOTE> but lord Town&s;hend
told him it would be proper to give it at the recommendation of the good
old archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.&mdash;Mr. Cadogan told him, that lord Sun|derland
wanted to be &s;ecretary of State: in ca&s;e the King choo&s;es to

another place. Lord Wharton and &s;everal other noblemen propo&s;ed to
him to recommend colonel Tirel to the King for one of the grooms of
his Maje&s;ty's bed-chamber. Bi&s;hop Burnet recommends his own &s;on;
but Bothmar thinks it would be better to give him &s;ome employment in
the law. Mr. Santyan wants to be a commi&s;&s;ioner of the cu&s;toms in
England, and Ridpath de&s;ires to be made one in Scotland.</P>
<P>The Prince cannot take the title of Prince of Wales, until the King
creates him. The duke of Bolton recommends his brother-in-law, Mr.
Crofts, to be a groom of the bed-chamber. Lord Winche&s;ter's elde&s;t
&s;on a&s;ked the &s;ame favour for him&s;elf. He is well made, but irregular
in his conduct, and on that account is on bad terms with his father.
Lord Hertford, the duke of Somer&s;et's elde&s;t &s;on, wants to be a groom
of the bed-chamber to the King or to the Prince. Town&s;hend and other
friends recommend lord Lincoln for &s;uch a place. Lord re|commends
him&s;elf. Bothmar thinks the King &s;hould give &s;uch a place
to lord Dor&s;et, to recompen&s;e him for his journey, and make lord Orford
fir&s;t lord of the Admiralty, "before lord Strafford applies to be conti|nued;
and likewi&s;e to recall that man &s;oon from the Hague; that will
plea&s;e the Dutch and a great many here. He is not only hated, but
likewi&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed by his countrymen, as a vain man, who has not the
&s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions to be &s;o."</P>
<P>The duke of Buckingham reque&s;ted, that his dutche&s;s might be made
a maid of honour to the prince&s;s. "She is hand&s;ome, and appears to
me &s;it for &s;uch a place; but &s;he could not obtain it from the late Queen,
although &s;he was her natural &s;i&s;ter. I don't know if it was for that
rea&s;on &s;he did not choo&s;e to have her &s;o nearher, but preferred rather to
give her a pen&s;ion." The duke of Grafton, who&s;e mother had married the
Speaker, Sir Thomas Hanmer, de&s;ired likewi&s;e to be of the King's bed|chamber.
Bothmar gives him a high character, and recommends him.</P>

<P>"I Ea&s;ily ob&s;erve here, that tho&s;e who are called the Tory-party have
very good intelligence from your court, and that you recommend
&s;trongly a proper conduct to them. Three months ago they treated us
as &s;editious on account of the zeal we &s;hewed for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, at a time

di&s;pute to be for us. However, they had the indi&s;cretion to &s;hew them|&s;elves
Saturday la&s;t, more than they intended, by their oppo&s;ition to the
act for putting a price on the head of the Pretender. I can a&s;&s;ure your

be able to &s;ay, that you are not governed by a party: for as they are now
given, they are in the hands of the mo&s;t violent of a party, of whom the

<P>I a&s;k your Excellency's pardon for the liberty I take. If what I have the

gave univer&s;al &s;atisfaction. I wi&s;h, while the King is at the Hague, he
would concert mea&s;ures with the States to &s;ecure the navigation of the
Baltic. We find the reputation and intere&s;t of England lo&s;t and &s;acri|ficed
in all parts of the world; the Spaniards, the Algerines, and &s;everal
other nations in&s;ult us in the Streights; the Danes and Swedes in the
North; and if Providence had not, in this juncture, called the King to the
throne, our trade had been every where de&s;troyed: if, therefore, his Ma|je&s;ty
can retrieve our &s;inking commerce, he will gain the hearts of all his
people. The Dutch were quite wearied out with the double-dealing and
tricks of this court about their barrier: if the King, by his good offices,
could adju&s;t that between the Emperor and the States, it would be a
great glory and happine&s;s to his Maje&s;ty; they being the mo&s;t u&s;eful al|lies,
both to the King and the&s;e nations. I did not doubt that the King
would approve what we had done to put a &s;top to the league which was
framing again&s;t the Emperor in Italy; and I thought nothing could be
more agreeable to the King than the making a &s;trict union between him
and the court of Vienna. The affair of Portugal is fully &s;et out in our
letter to his Maje&s;ty; and I will trouble you no further, but to a&s;&s;ure you

<P>"I Entreat you not to think of putting the expence of your tables, or
any other expence for the court which you bring along with you,
upon the civil li&s;t here: that would be directly contrary to the laws
which exclude &s;trangers from offices and emoluments in this country.
Such a preten&s;ion would exa&s;perate; and &s;o far from giving any room

his genero&s;ity, his rectitude and regularity in every thing. The
very propo&s;al of charging that expence upon the civil li&s;t, would not only
deprive him of that advantage, and give a quite oppo&s;ite idea of him,

<P>BOthmar delivered to the regency the King's me&s;&s;age about Boling-broke:
he wi&s;hes his place may be given to lord Town&s;hend, though
Sunderland a&s;ks it. "Lord Bolingbroke makes up Mr. Prior's di&s;patch,

would never &s;erve the Elector: he did not believe then, that the time
would ever be when he would be taken at his word." Bothmar inclo&s;ed
a letter from lord Mar, and another from lord Bolingbroke, to the
King. Bolingbroke wrote about his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, for the regency had de|prived

of the council, he advi&s;es the duke of Devon&s;hire to apply for that place,
in order thereby to keep lord Powlet in his office of ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e|hold;

<P>THE Editor has thought proper to annex to this volume an Appendix, con|taining
a &s;hort review of &s;uch papers, in Nairne's collection, as were not
deemed &s;ufficiently important to be in&s;erted. He has al&s;o &s;ubjoined &s;ome account
of papers collected by Carte, relating to the affairs of this kingdom before the Re|&s;toration,
in the year 1660. There are many letters, corre&s;pondences, memorials,
and anecdotes concerning the reign of George the Fir&s;t, &s;till in the Editor's hands.
The&s;e he de&s;igned to have printed; but he finds that this volume has already
&s;welled to a &s;ize that precludes him, at pre&s;ent, from executing his purpo&s;e. They
&s;hall, however, be &s;oon given to the public. In this Appendix the order of time

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bundle of loo&s;e papers.</NOTE>Life of James II. Written by him&s;elf.</HEAD>
<P>KING James the Second was born, on the fourteenth of October, 1633, about
twelve at night. He went out of London, with his father, the Queen, and
the prince&s;s Mary, to Dover. He was &s;ent back to St. James's; prince Charles
only going to York. About Ea&s;ter, the marquis of Hertford was ordered to bring
the duke to him. The marquis had received an order from the parliament not to
carry the duke of York out of town; yet he did. He went with the Pal&s;grave,
and other lords and gentlemen, to Hull; the King intending to follow the next
day. Sir L. Dyves came, the next day before dinner, and told the governor, that
the King would dine with him. They were on a platform, by the water-&s;ide.
The governor turned pale. He de&s;ired the duke and company to retire to their
lodgings. The gates were &s;hut and the garri&s;on put in arms. The King came;
and, &s;eeing the gates &s;hut, a&s;ked to &s;peak with the governor, who excu&s;ed him&s;elf
from letting him enter, as tru&s;ted by the parliament. The King gave rea&s;ons, in
vain. The governor had received adverti&s;ement from York, from William Mur|ray<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was, afterwards, created earl of Dy&s;ert.</NOTE>,
one of the King's bed-chamber, as a friend, advi&s;ing him not to let in the
King; who was re&s;olved, if ma&s;ter of the town, to &s;ecure him and cut off his
head. Nothing was more fal&s;e, yet it had effect on Hotham.</P>
<P>The King then de&s;ired, that his &s;on and the re&s;t might come out to him. They
were, accordingly, &s;ent out, one after another. He then went back to Beverly
<PB N="658" REF="684">
and York. In Hull, there was a magazine of arms and amunition, for above
twenty thou&s;and men, and a train &s;uitable. The King could not arm a hundred
men. Had he not &s;ent Sir L. Dyves before, he might, perhaps, have been ad|mitted,
and would then be ma&s;ter of the town, which was affectionate to him; and
the gentry attending were too numerous for Hotham to re&s;i&s;t. The &s;oldiers of the
garri&s;on all threw down their arms, being called upon, by &s;ome of the King's train
without, to do &s;o; nor did they take them up again, till their officers, with their
&s;words in hand, forced them. Some vigorous, bold men, that went with the duke
of York, &s;hould have been tru&s;ted with the de&s;ign, with an order on the re&s;t to
obey the duke. For it was in their power, &s;everal times after Hotham ordered the
gates to be &s;hut, to have &s;ecured him, or knocked him on the head: Either would
have done the work. Hotham came into the duke's room without any officer with
him, where he had before confined the duke; yet none &s;eized the opportunity.
Sir L. Dyves and William Murray, groom of the duke of York's bed-chamber,
were the only ones for &s;uch a &s;tep; and were re&s;olved to kill him. But they were
confined, before they could do it, and a guard put upon them; yet they were let
out with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The King wanted money and arms. The Queen &s;ent captain J. Strahan, with
arms and amunition and officers in the Providence, from Holland; el&s;e, the King
could not have formed an army. Captain Strahan brought them into the Humber,
where lea&s;t expected; &s;o run a-ground at a place appointed. He went from Brill
to the Humber. The &s;ignal was not an&s;wered. He was forced to anchor, when
the tide was &s;pent. The parliament &s;hip of fifty-four guns came down from Hull
and anchored, with another from Grim&s;by, near him. They ordered him aboard.
But, commanding one of the King's Ships, he refu&s;ed. He waited till afloat, and
then &s;tood towards Hull, till near high-water. He pa&s;&s;ed over a &s;and, then but
twelve feet water; and, when pa&s;t it, ran a-ground. The parliament's &s;hips
drawing more water, were not able to follow. The Providence drew but eleven
feet and a half water. He got into the other channel, by bearing up with all his
&s;ails. The parliament's &s;hips, trying to follow, &s;tuck fa&s;t. Strahan landed at
Powle, &s;ome miles below Hull, on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Humber; and ran his &s;hips
a&s;hore; &s;o that it &s;erved for a battery to defend it&s;elf, whil&s;t the arms were landed,
and the &s;eamen and officers were intrenched; &s;o that Hull garri&s;on dur&s;t not attack
them. A convoy was &s;ent from York. The King would not let the &s;hip be burnt,
after the guns were taken out and carried to York. The &s;eamen were made
gunners.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex's men were po&s;ted in the vale near Keynton.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1642. Oct. 23.</NOTE> The King marched down
the hill to fight them. Ruthen, who had &s;erved as major general under the King
of Sweden, and the earl of Brent&s;ord, being ordered to draw up the army, Lind&s;ay
<PB N="659" REF="685">
took it ill, and &s;aid he would &s;erve as colonel; and put him&s;elf at the head of his
regiment of foot po&s;ted again&s;t E&s;&s;ex. The King's army was above four thou&s;and
hor&s;e and eight thou&s;and foot. The rebels were three thou&s;and &s;tronger in foot;
but had not many more hor&s;e, and few cannon. It was three <HI>p. m.</HI> before the King's
army were embattled; when they marched &s;lowly, but with great re&s;olution; re|ceiving
the rebels &s;hot, till they came to pu&s;h of the pike. Both &s;ides retiring, as
if by mutual con&s;ent, back a few paces, &s;truck down their colours and &s;tood firm,
till both drew off, when it began to grow dark. The enemy's left wing fled, as
&s;oon as charged. They were pur&s;ued, without falling on the foot. The enemy's
foot made the King's retire to their cannon; which, playing with &s;ucce&s;s, &s;topt
them. Prince Rupert could not &s;top his hor&s;e from pur&s;uing, or make them charge
the foot. Lord Willoughby's gallant behaviour over his father's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The earl of Lind&s;ey, who died, &s;oon after, of his wounds at Warwick. He was an

with his thigh broke by a mu&s;ket-&s;hot, and carried him to bs dre&s;&s;ed. But he was
taken, by &s;ome &s;traggling hor&s;e, who came in the way. Sir Edmund Verney was
killed and his &s;tandard taken. But it was recovered, by the means of Sir James
Smith. Both armies retired to their former po&s;ts; and the King &s;ent, early next
morning, five hundred hor&s;e, which brought off his own cannon, and &s;ix of the
enemy's. Sir Faithful Forte&s;cue had given notice of his intention, &s;ome days be|fore.
There were not full one thou&s;and, on both &s;ides, &s;lain; as the par&s;on, who
buried and counted them, &s;aid. Lord Aubigny and lieutenant-colonel Monro
were among the number. The earl of Lind&s;ey died of his wounds at Warwick.
About &s;ixty &s;tandards were taken from the rebels. The King marched to Edgert
and Banbury, taking the ca&s;tle; and &s;o to Oxford. But it was of fatal con&s;e|quence,
that he did not march to London; which, in the fright, would not have
coil him a &s;troke.</P>
<P>Ruthen, the day after the battle, de&s;ired the King to &s;end him, with mo&s;t of the
hor&s;e and three thou&s;and foot to London, where he would get before E&s;&s;ex, &s;eize
We&s;tmin&s;ter, drive away the rebel part of the parliament, and maintain it, till the
King came up with the re&s;t of the army. But this was oppo&s;ed, by the advice of
many of the council. They were afraid that the King &s;hould return by conque&s;t;
and, &s;aid &s;o openly. They per&s;uaded the King to advance &s;o &s;lowly to London,
that E&s;&s;ex got there before him; and the parliament, ready before to fly, took
heart. All the King's old foot were lo&s;t in the &s;iege of Glouce&s;ter and battle of
Newbury.</P>
<P><PB N="660" REF="686">
The duke of York might have e&s;caped from Oxford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1648. April 20.</NOTE> if Sir George Ratcliff, his
governor, would have &s;uffered it, without a po&s;itive order from the King. He
was carried to London, where the duke of Glouce&s;ter and the prince&s;s Elizabeth
had been left, when the King went to the North. The earl of Northumberland
was made his governor. All re&s;pect was u&s;ed to him. George Howard, brother
to the earl of Suffolk, and colonel Jo&s;eph Bampfield<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His real name was Bamford; an Iri&s;hman.</NOTE> contrived his e&s;cape; the
fir&s;t carrying all the me&s;&s;ages between the duke and Bampfield, which was all he
had to do.</P>
<P>All things being prepared, the duke of York &s;upped, at the u&s;ual hour, about
&s;even, with his brother and &s;i&s;ter, and after &s;upper all played at hide and &s;eek, with
the re&s;t of the young people of the hou&s;e; having played at it con&s;tantly every
night for above a fortnight before. The duke u&s;ed to hide him&s;elf in a place
where they could not find him, for half an hour or more; and then he would
come out to them. To prevent &s;u&s;picion of his being gone, when he really was,
the duke lockt up a little dog, that u&s;ed to follow him, into his &s;i&s;ter's chamber,
to prevent his coming after him, &s;lipt down the back &s;tairs, went into the inner|mo&s;t
garden, and &s;o into the Park, out of a back door of the &s;aid garden, of which
he had a key, where Bampfield &s;taid for him; having a footman with a cloak,
which the duke put on, with a peruke he had ready, and went through Spring-Gardens,
where one Mr. Trip &s;taid with a hackney-coach, which carried them to
Sali&s;bury-hou&s;e. Here the duke and Bampfield went out of the coach, as if
going in there; and Trip went with the coach into the city, and kept it as long
as he could, at the end of the town. But as &s;oon as the coach was gone, they
took boat and landed on the &s;ame &s;ide of the river, clo&s;e to the bridge, and went to
one Loo's, a &s;urgeon, where they found Mrs. Murray, who had women's cloaths
ready for him to put on. He was dre&s;t pre&s;ently, and went with Bampfield to
Lion-key, where there &s;tayed a four-oared barge for them. They went in it down
the river; the tyde &s;erving them.</P>
<P>But they no &s;ooner entered the barge than the ma&s;ter &s;u&s;pected &s;omething;
Bampfield having told him to be there with his barge, and he &s;hould bring a friend
with him, not &s;aying it &s;hould be a woman. He thought &s;omething more was
in it, and was &s;o frightened, that, as they went down, he did nothing but talked
with them, how impo&s;&s;ible it was for them to pa&s;s by the Block-hou&s;e at Grave&s;|end,
without being di&s;covered; and that they had no other way to get on board
the &s;hip that &s;taid for them at the Hope, but to land at Grave&s;end, and get a pair
of oars to carry them down. When they debated the di&s;tance, and &s;hewed him the
hazard of getting a boat to carry them to the &s;hip, he objected, the light of the
moon. He was &s;oon &s;atisfied fully, that his woman was &s;ome di&s;gui&s;ed body of
great quality. For, peeping through a cranny of the door of the barge, where
they then had a candle burning, he &s;aw the duke put his leg upon the table and
<PB N="661" REF="687">
pluck up his &s;tockings, in &s;o indecent a manner, as made him conclude what he
had before &s;u&s;pected. This confounded him &s;o, as he told them afterwards, that
he hardly knew what he did or &s;aid; which they perceiving, thought it be&s;t to tell
him the truth and tru&s;t him, knowing him to be an hone&s;t man. So the duke told
him who he was, and a&s;&s;ured him, that he would take care to provide for him; and,
if it was not &s;afe to return to London, to carry him to Holland. The man's mind
was now &s;ettled. He re&s;olved to pa&s;s by the Block-hou&s;e, without going a&s;hore;
and, when they came near the town, he put out the light; let the barge drive down
with the tyde; pa&s;&s;ed undi&s;covered by the Block-hou&s;e, and got to the &s;hip, a
Dutch pink of &s;eventy tons, lying for them, at the upper end of the Hope. She
had been cleared at Grave&s;end, where Sir Nicholas Armourer, colonel Mayard,
Richard John&s;on, three gentlemen, with each a &s;ervant, expected them, whom
Bampfield had tru&s;ted and &s;ent before, that, by their help, he might ma&s;ter the
ve&s;&s;el, if need.</P>
<P>They &s;et &s;ail, at break of day, with a fair wind, and anchored early next morn|ing,
before Flu&s;hing, where they &s;taid, expecting the tyde to carry them up to
Middleburg. The ma&s;ter, with two of his four hands, went a&s;hore with the boat
to Flu&s;hing, intending to be back, by the time the water was high enough to
go to Middleburg. But before he came back, Owen, ma&s;ter of the barge, who
came along with the duke, came down, in a great fright to the &s;mall cabbin,
telling them that a parliament frigate was coming in to look for them, and would
be with them pre&s;ently; and that they mu&s;t get their anchor on board and &s;ail for
Middleburg. He was po&s;itive it was a frigate. The two &s;eamen would not get
up anchor till the ma&s;ter came back. But they were forced by the gentlemen and
&s;ervants to do it; though they &s;aid there was not water for it, and the &s;hip would
be lo&s;t. The &s;hip proved only a merchantman. The ve&s;&s;el &s;truck twice or thrice.
But the ma&s;ter coming on board, and the tyde &s;erving, they got to Middleburg,
before the tyde was &s;pent. The duke landed in women's cloaths, &s;taid all night,
went next morning to Dordrecht; and &s;ent Bampfield, next day, to the Hague,
to acquaint his &s;i&s;ter and the prince of Orange of his arrival, and to de&s;ire cloaths.
He was mi&s;&s;ed, in an hour's time, at St. James's. When he was not &s;ound, on
&s;earch, notice was given to Whitehall and general Fairfax.</P>
<P>Ri&s;ing in Kent.&mdash;Rain&s;borough commanded a &s;quadron in the Downs of one
&s;econd rate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May, 1648.</NOTE> three or four fourth, one fifth, and three or four &s;ixth rates, and &s;ome
ketches; the Con&s;tant-Reformation, Convertin, Antelope, Swallow, Satisfaction,
Hind, Roebuck, Pelican, Con&s;tant-Warwick. The&s;e, on notice of the three
ca&s;tles being &s;urprized and &s;eized, by the in&s;urgents, declared for the King.
Rain&s;borough &s;eeing that they of Deal had been in&s;trumental in it, went on board
a ketch to go nearer to the &s;hore, the better to &s;ee what was doing there, and thence
&s;ent orders to his &s;hip to get under fail, and &s;tand as near as they could to the
<PB N="662" REF="688">
&s;hore, in order to batter the town. Accordingly, they worked to get their anchors
on board; and in doing which, in the Con&s;tant-Reformation, Rain&s;borough's &s;hip,
and heaving out the cap&s;tern, one of the boat&s;wain's mates, Robert Lindale,
thought it the proper time to execute the re&s;olution, which he had taken &s;ome time
before, of doing &s;omething to &s;erve the King. Having opened him&s;elf to three
more common &s;eamen, whom he had found to be of his principles, he propo&s;ed,
as all Kent had declared for the King, to get &s;ome of the &s;hips to do &s;o. They,
now, as heaving the cap&s;tern, began to grumble at the orders received; &s;aying,
they had no rea&s;on to batter Deal, which was full of their wives, children, and
relations, to de&s;troy it and them. This working on the men, they ventured
further to &s;ay, that it would be better to join with them for the King. On cry|ing,
one and all, for the King, Lindale told them, he believed that the lieute|nant
and &s;ome other officers of the &s;hip would be again&s;t it, and they mu&s;t imme|diately
po&s;&s;e&s;s the gun-room and arm them&s;elves; and then they might &s;eize their
officers and tho&s;e that would not join them. They did &s;o; &s;ecured their officers,
telling them they would declare for the King; and, as they would not comply,
they put them in the hold, till they let them go a&s;hore, and &s;uch as had a mind to
go with them. The officers were forced to &s;ubmit. This done, he got under
fail, and, pa&s;&s;ing along the broad-&s;ide of the next &s;hip, told them what they had
done, and bid them &s;eize their officers, in like manner, el&s;e they would &s;ink
them; and thus, from &s;hip to &s;hip, till every one had declared for the King.</P>
<P>Rain&s;borough, &s;eeing his &s;hip had got under &s;ail, and yet not come up to him,
as he ordered, but &s;peaking to one another, went to them with his ketch, and a&s;ked
his own &s;hip what they were doing. They told him, he mu&s;t not put his foot in
it, they having declared for the King; but would &s;end him his &s;ervants and &s;ome
of his officers. They did &s;o; and, on his beginning to talk with them to return
to obedience, bid him hold his tongue or they would fire on him. So he went
away in his ketch up the river to acquaint the parliament. The other &s;hips turned
out all their commanders, then came a&s;hore to tell the Kent gentry what they had
done; and to de&s;ire &s;ome that were &s;eamen to come on board and command them,
as Sir William Palmer, captain Bargrave, captain Foy, and others did, and put
in other officers. Before they got out of the Downs, the earl of Warwick came
down in a ketch from the parliament, to get them to return to their duty, and
de&s;ired to come on board of them. They &s;ent to know fir&s;t what his bu&s;ine&s;s
was. He offered pardon, redre&s;s of grievances, if they would declare for the
parliament. Their an&s;wer was, they valued not the promi&s;es of parliament:
that they had declared for the King, and would be loyal. The earl &s;hewed a
letter, by which he had been invited down by &s;ome. All the&s;e were &s;ent to him.
He de&s;ired one of the &s;hips, for his better accommodation, to carry him up the
river; promi&s;ing, on his honour, to &s;end it back. They let him have the Nico|demus,
a &s;ixth rate, but he did not keep his word.</P>
<P><PB N="663" REF="689">
They then went to Holland, where the duke of York was, to receive the
prince's commands, and arrived at Helveot&s;luys. The duke went and &s;taid on board
with them, till the prince came by &s;ea from France. He took the command and
failed for the Downs; leaving the duke in Holland, and having fir&s;t di&s;charged
Bampfield, an unquiet, intriguing head, from his brother's &s;ervice. His tamper|ing
with the &s;eamen, and driving on a pre&s;byterian intere&s;t, &s;o offended the duke,
that he would never take him again into his &s;ervice, whatever application was
made. Yet he &s;upplied him with what he was able, in his condition, till the Re|&s;toration.</P>
<P>The prince, about the end of &s;ummer, came with the fleet to Helveot&s;luys.
The earl of Warwick, with the parliament-fleet, followed to the &s;ame port. The
Dutch would &s;uffer no ho&s;tilities; and Warwick returned. Prince Rupert, who
was made commander of the King's &s;hips went with prince Maurice to Ireland,
Portugal, the Streights, and the We&s;t Indies, where prince Maurice and &s;ome
&s;hips were lo&s;t. Prince Rupert returned to Europe, in 1653, and landed at Nantz.
The duke of York went to Paris, a few days before his father's murder. The
King came thither, in his way to Ireland, where nothing con&s;iderable remained
in the rebels hands, but Dublin. But he &s;taid all the &s;ummer at St. Germains, or
in Jer&s;ey, till the end of September, where he landed on the twenty-&s;ixth of Sep|tember,
and received an account of the rout near Rathmines. All thoughts of
Ireland were laid a&s;ide; and the two &s;hips &s;ent by the prince of Orange to tran&s;|port
him, were &s;ent back to Holland. Addre&s;&s;es were made there from Scotland,
by one Windram, an hone&s;t gentleman. The King re&s;olved to return to Holland
to treat with the Scots. The Queen-mother met him at Beauvois. After &s;ome
days &s;tay, he proceeded to Holland. He agreed with the Scots commi&s;&s;ioners, and
went to Scotland. The duke of York &s;taid at Jer&s;ey, till the September of 1650.
He went to Paris, by the King's orders, on the &s;eventeenth. But he left it on the
fourth of October, and came to Bru&s;&s;els on the thirteenth of the &s;ame month,
where he &s;taid till the middle of December. The prince of Orange died of the
&s;mall pox on the &s;ixth of November; and the prince&s;s was delivered of a &s;on on
the fourteenth, eight days after his death.</P>
<P>He went to the Hague, and &s;taid till the twelfth of January, 1651, when the
Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador was there received; and then went to Breda. But, &s;ome
days after, he returned to the Hague. In June he was ordered, by the King, to
return to Paris, and follow the Queen-mother's advice. He arrived there in the
end of June. The King landed about the middle of October, at Fe&s;camp in
Normandie; and coming to Paris, cardinal de Retz brought him a va&s;t &s;um of
money in his coach, which the King would not receive, not knowing when he
&s;hould be able to pay it. The cardinal &s;hewed him&s;elf very affectionate to him.
He propo&s;ed his marriage with the duke of Orleans'a daughter. The King vi&s;ited
<PB N="664" REF="690">
her often. But &s;he grew cool; being put in the head of marrying the King of
France, and that the Queen-mother would be forced to con&s;ent to it. So the match
was broke off Mademoi&s;elle, only daughter of the duke of Longueville, by his
fir&s;t wife, &s;i&s;ter of the cardinal Soi&s;&s;ons, was, at the &s;ame time, propo&s;ed for the
duke of York; the greate&s;t match, next to Mademoi&s;elle, in France. But the
court of France would not con&s;ent. The duke went a volunteer in the campaign
of 1652.</P>

<P>In one of the quarto volumes of Mr. Nairne's papers, there are "&s;undry letters
from Sir Toby Bourke, envoy extraordinary from the King of England to Spain;

<P>Sir Toby was a vain, heavy, and prolix corre&s;pondent. He wrote upwards of

compliments from their Catholic Maje&s;ties to the Queen at St. Germains, and her

<P>"A rough &s;ketch and orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE> about complaints and calumnies again&s;t the King's
&s;ervants." This order was probably obtained through the influence of the earl of
Melfort, who had become very di&s;agreeable to many of James's friends in England.
There is a paper in his own hand, after he had retired from St. Germains, enti|tuled,
Memoire ju&s;tificatif du comte de Melfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE> 17 <HI>Mai,</HI> 1694. This paper con|&s;i&s;ts
of twenty-four pages. Melfort begins with ob&s;erving that he had been in
great favour with Charles, and with James; and that neither the changing his
religion, nor his ri&s;ing &s;o high in office, had procured him any enemies, "before
the prince of Orange's arrival, which he had always foretold, without being
believed: but that he had drawn upon him&s;elf hatred, and many enemies, for
the following rea&s;ons, viz. for having advi&s;ed the King to accept of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of France, to &s;end the prince of Wales into a place of &s;afety, and to &s;eize the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable of his enemies before the prince of Orange's arrival."</P>
<P>When the earl of Sunderland was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, King James's bu&s;ine&s;s with the
court of France was committed to Melfort. He &s;ays he per&s;uaded his ma&s;ter to
accept of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France; and having, by his orders, made the propo&s;als
to Barillon, he received, for an&s;wer, that there were no troops now on the coa&s;t
of France, nor ve&s;&s;els to tran&s;port them. This gave great offence to the Engli&s;h,
particularly to the earl of Middleton, one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. Melfort was
in danger of being a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; &s;uch were the prejudices of the people again&s;t the
French. He was obliged to retire to France, and had their Maje&s;ties orders to
meet the prince of Wales at Dieppe, where the prince would have landed, if he
had been &s;ent, according to their Maje&s;ties orders, from Port&s;mouth. Upon
James's arrival at St. Germains, Melfort was made &s;ecretary of &s;tate for England;
and, again&s;t his will, was obliged to attend his Maje&s;ty to Ireland. He dreaded
<PB N="675" REF="701">
lord Tyrconnel's temper and pride. He claims great merit to him&s;elf, for having
&s;aved that kingdom, by his invention of copper currency, and from his other &s;er|vices
and fatigues. He left Ireland, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf to be &s;u&s;pected of having
been in di&s;grace with his ma&s;ter; until it was &s;een, that he was employed to exe|cute
a particular commi&s;&s;ion at Rome. But &s;till he &s;ays, Sir Theophilus Ogle|thorp
and his lady, who is very intriguing and cunning, continued to do him ill
offices. They thought it impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould pardon them; and therefore,
they retained their malice again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Melfort was recalled from Rome, where he acquitted him&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction
of the French mini&s;try, to act again as &s;ecretary of &s;tate. He carried on the corre|&s;pondence
with England. James's friends increa&s;ed. The King of France was
induced to attempt an inva&s;ion, and communicated his intentions to Melfort
alone. James, from thenceforward, never called to his council five Roman Ca|tholic
&s;ervants, with whom he u&s;ed to con&s;ult while Melfort was at Rome. This
&s;tep, which Melfort oppo&s;ed, in vain, created him many enemies.</P>
<P>While Melfort was ab&s;ent, Montgomery, who&s;e father and grandfather were
great enemies to the crown of Scotland, propo&s;ed to the King and to the Queen,
by his emi&s;&s;aries, and particularly by one Jones, to &s;eize the government. The
papers, which concern this affair, were delivered up to the mini&s;try, though Mont|gomery
and Jones maintained the contrary; as Melfort had foretold from Rome,
from his knowledge of the men who were to conduct it. Montgomery, on ac|count
of his hatred to the prince of Orange, having gained credit with two or
three of the King's friends, began again to make propo&s;als to the King, and to
give him information of &s;ome men of quality who were in his intere&s;t. As the&s;e
men, in who&s;e name Montgomery had advanced &s;everal things, were for the prince
of Orange and Whigs at bottom, the King had rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t him, and a&s;k an
explanation. Jones was &s;ent over by Montgomery; and, when he arrived at St.
Germains, in&s;tead of &s;hewing who the&s;e men of quality were, the King &s;aw that
he had nothing to expect from Montgomery; and the corre&s;pondence was inter|rupted
until Melfort returned from Rome, except &s;ome letters which Montgomery
wrote from time to time to Strafford, &s;oliciting money. A per&s;on who was &s;o at|tached
to the King, that he &s;uffered the torture with great firmne&s;s, without mak|ing
any di&s;covery, was &s;ent, in the mean time, by one of the King's loyal &s;ubjects
from Scotland, to inform him, that Montgomery had declared, at the table of the
marquis of Montro&s;e, who is the King's great enemy, that he al&s;o would be his
enemy to his death.</P>
<P>The corre&s;pondence was interrupted. Jones, at the in&s;tance of the King's
friends in England, was thrown into the Ba&s;tile. Abb&eacute; Renaudot complained,
that Melfort received few letters from England, and furni&s;hed him with no materials
for his Gazette. He went to &s;ee Jones in the Ba&s;tile, Jones promi&s;ed to renew
<PB N="676" REF="702">
the corre&s;pondence, and, by Renaudot's means, was allowed to make his e&s;cape.
When he arrived in England, he blamed Melfort for his impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Melfort, in the remaining part of this long memorial, enlarges upon the pre|judice
done to him, by the mi&s;repre&s;entations of Montgomery and Jones in Eng|land;
the intrigues of Abb&eacute; Renaudot in France; his own difference of opinion

hand, and probably a part of one of the letters he wrote, during his emba&s;&s;y at
Rome. It is in the following terms: "I &s;uppo&s;e you have heard of the great
doings here, with the <HI>principe Ingle&s;e,</HI> as they call him (Ru&s;&s;el). Here he pa&s;&s;es
for duke of Bedford. The cardinals and amba&s;&s;adors them&s;elves make court to
him. His defects are &s;upplied by father Co&s;mo Clark, who is every thing to him,
except his divine; which office is &s;upplied by a par&s;on. But the father is inter|preter,
mae&s;tro di camera, major domo; and I pray God he be not &s;omewhat be|&s;ides.
To &s;peak freely, but with &s;ecrecy, there are great abu&s;es in this matter;
this father pretending to every body, by way of &s;ecret, that he has a &s;ort of com|mi&s;&s;ion
from the King to treat with the Engli&s;h nobility, who may come hither;
and &s;ays, that the King has, by Mr. Carryl, writ to this lord, and given him the
title of marquis of Tavi&s;tock. Whether all this be real or &s;uppo&s;ed, is not the
<PB N="677" REF="703">
que&s;tion: that is not my bu&s;ine&s;s, &amp;c. But it &s;eems very improper, that one who
has no better guard upon his tongue, &s;hould be tru&s;ted in affairs of con&s;equence; one
who&s;e glory and vanity would make him not only boa&s;t of what is, but invent what
is not: of the which I'll give you a con&s;iderable in&s;tance. At Torre de Specchi, very
lately, he gave him&s;elf out for a per&s;on of a great family, and related to the King.
(By the by, he is grand&s;on to a taylor, and his father was a contemptible advo|cate.)
By this lie, he got a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent of Agnus Deis, finely wrought
and &s;et into ca&s;es, from a nun of the hou&s;e of Ma&s;&s;imi. Mrs. White told me,
this enquiring into his birth being a&s;ked by the &s;aid nun if what he &s;aid was true.
His keeping company with Prote&s;tants does not pa&s;s, without giving great &s;candal:
and, if he has any &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion, as pretended, he makes no other u&s;e of it,
but to &s;atisfy his worldly &s;atisfactions and appetites; which his habit would not
allow him to do, without this pretext of the royal countenance, he &s;ays he has&punc;

<HEAD>VOL. IV. QUARTO.</HEAD>
<P>THIS volume con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely of original letters concerning the intrigues
of the courts of St. Germains and Barleduc, during the years 1712 and 1713.
It con&s;i&s;ts of 77 numbers; and almo&s;t every one of the&s;e numbers contains &s;everal

<HEAD>Lettres et Memoires du Cardinal Gualterio. 2 Vols. 4to.</HEAD>
<P>THESE two volumes contain Gualterio's corre&s;pondence and negociations
during the years 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1719. They are almo&s;t all in Ita|lian,
and con&s;i&s;t of memorials to the Pope, letters to Nairne, and a few to the
Chevalier de St. George him&s;elf. The cardinal was the Chevalier's agent at Rome.
The &s;ubjects of his letters and memorials are the &s;everity of the oaths of allegiance
on the Engli&s;h Roman Catholicks&mdash;An application to the Pope for a di&s;pen&s;ation
to take them&mdash;Lord Peterborough's arre&s;t at Bologna&mdash;Secret negociations about

the Chevalier's marriage&mdash;Negociations with the court of Spain, and an offer of

throne&mdash;Difficulties attending the Chevalier's marriage and place of abode&mdash;Cold|ne&s;s
of the court of Rome&mdash;Various negociations and corre&s;pondences.</P>
<P>Gualterio's letters are mo&s;tly in cyphers, but the cant-names are ea&s;ily explained.
Neither his letters nor his memorials are of much importance; and accordingly
few extracts have been made from them.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="papers">
<HEAD>VOLUMES VII. VIII. and IX. QUARTO.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e volumes is "a copy-book of the earl of Middleton's letters
begun at St. Germains, 19th April, 1693, to 28th March, 1695." The &s;econd
is, "Entrys of &s;ome letters of the earl of Middleton's, mo&s;t of them writt
by M. from the 14th June, 1713, to the 13 Juillet, 1712, with &s;ome letters of
1700." And the third is, "Entries of &s;ome letters writt to England to Abram
and Berry, &amp;c. from 1709 to 1713; &s;ome by earl Middleton, and mo&s;t by N."
(Nairne.)</P>
<P>The&s;e letters throw con&s;iderable light on the intrigues of the times, and every
thing has been extracted from them, that was any ways connected with the general
hi&s;tory, or with the private conduct and characters of individuals. They are
mo&s;tly allegorical and in cyphers, and are often without a key: but every thing
of importance in them hath been explained by a careful attention to trace the chain
of the corre&s;pondence, and an unwearied application in comparing them with one
another, and in di&s;covering the views, connexions, &amp;c. of the &s;everal per&s;ons
concerned. Acce&s;s to the letters, to which the&s;e volumes contain an&s;wers, would
have greatly abridged this labour, but perhaps have brought but few important
facts to light.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Thomas Carte was a great collector of anecdotes. From one
8vo. and three 4to. volumes of his memorandum-books, and a bundle of loo&s;e
papers, &s;uch of them have been in&s;erted in the preceding volumes as were &s;up|ported
by collateral evidence, and connected with the hi&s;tory of the period to
which Mr. Nairne's papers extend. But as many of the papers collected by him
in a large &s;olio volume, marked A. L. were not comprehended within this period
it is nece&s;&s;ary to give a more particular account of them. He him&s;elf made
&s;ome u&s;e of them to the year 1654, where his hi&s;tory ends. It will be &s;ufficient
to give a li&s;t of tho&s;e to which he has not referred, and a &s;hort account of their
contents, where they are of any importance.</P>

<P>The following paragraph of this letter is in cyphers. "The Emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia
hath, you know, bani&s;hed all Engli&s;h trade, and the merchants are making up
their packs as fa&s;t as they can. But before they go, I intend to demand of the
Emperor of Mu&s;cow the cu&s;tom unpaid for the Engli&s;h goods, &s;ince they &s;ubmitted
to the new authority in England; and if the Emperor will comply with the King's
de&s;ire in any thing, it will more probably be in this demand, which is &s;o notori|ou&s;ly
grounded on his Maje&s;ty's right, and which will not co&s;t the &s;aid Emperor
any thing out of his own pur&s;e. This &s;hall not &s;lacken my endeavours in the re&s;t
(literally in my in&s;tructions) but &s;hall only be a re&s;erve.&mdash;The duke of Courland,
as his agent at Am&s;terdam told me, will lend his Maje&s;ty three good &s;hips; the
lea&s;t of twenty-five guns. They are now in the&s;e parts; but it ought to be con|cealed,
if accepted, until they &s;hall be at &s;ea, for many rea&s;ons. M. Wicford, at
the Hague, will negotiate any thing with the agent who had orders to comply
with the King's de&s;ire therein, that you &s;hall intimate. He him&s;elf has a de&s;ign
to &s;end two or three good &s;hips to the Ea&s;t Indies, with the King's commi&s;&s;ion,
and likewi&s;e with goods to trade, if his Maje&s;ty thinks fit; paying a good pro|portion
of the value of the prizes to him. I only propounded for you to judge of
it as I do the rai&s;ing of a very round &s;um, upon the i&s;lands of Scilly, upon a
treaty to be made with the&s;e States. Think well of this latter, and whether the

King will be able to defend and relieve them this next &s;ummer. But, if he might
receive 50,000 <HI>l.</HI> and they be put into the States' hands, as caution only for the
money, whereby they &s;hould be defended by them, and po&s;&s;ibly they thereby in&s;en|&s;ibly
engaged in the King's quarrel, it might be no ill bargain."</P>

Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">139.</NOTE> Charles, in the&s;e letters, promi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the conditions which
were propo&s;ed to him, and particularly to acknowledge the convention of e&s;tates,
then a&s;&s;embled in Scotland, to be a parliament. At the &s;ame time he wrote a letter
to the marquis of Montro&s;e, a&s;&s;uring him, that he would make no conce&s;&s;ions, in|con&s;i&s;tent
with the powers he had given him in his commi&s;&s;ion; and declaring,
that, though he called them a committee of e&s;tates, he was determined not to ac|knowledge
them to be legally &s;o. This letter was intercepted, and was of infinite

over; and the only doubt remaining is, whether the treaty will produce an agree|ment;

<P>"I am not certain, but there may be
&s;ome attempts to trim the &s;ettlement of Ireland; and &s;ome neate-handed barbers of
the law may contrive how it mu&s;t be done, if they are back't with force. Yet I
&s;hould think there are but two ways; either by commi&s;&s;ion or by parliament. That
of commi&s;&s;ion has bin tried and laid a&s;ide: but it may be rea&s;&s;umed, and this
thought to be a more favourable conjuncture for it than 1670. To &s;hake the
&s;ettlement by parliament requires more preparation; &s;heriffs to favour elections
mu&s;t be named; and the hou&s;e of lords mu&s;t be filled with peers, that will concur.

<P>It is an account of facts which are well known.</P>
<P>Extract of a letter from Sir John Percival,<NOTE PLACE="marg">229.</NOTE> July 14th, 1685.</P>
<P>He writes about the affairs of Ireland; the hard&s;hips of the act prohibiting the
Iri&s;h to trade directly to the plantations; and the con&s;equences of the proclama|tion
calling in the arms of the militia.</P>
<P>"This proclamation doth di&s;quiet the minds of the militia, e&s;pecially of the
common &s;ort, who are all fearful, left endeavours &s;hould have been u&s;ed to re|pre&s;ent
them to his Maje&s;ty, as per&s;ons di&s;affected to his &s;ervice, and not fit to be
tru&s;ted with arms, though they are all Engli&s;h, and univer&s;ally, in tho&s;e parts,
Prote&s;tants of the church of England, and have all taken the oaths of allegiance
and &s;upremacy, a little before King Charles the Second's death (&s;uch being then
turned out as refu&s;ed); and the officers have all produced certificates of their hav|ing
taken the &s;acrament, as required by the church of England, upon an order
from the government of this kingdom, about 12 months &s;ince. And many of the
Iri&s;h gentlemen of this country openly &s;pread abroad reports, and tell the Engli&s;h
them&s;elves, that their arms are thus called in to be given to them, as the King's
be&s;t &s;ubjects; and that, they &s;ay, is the meaning of the proclamation, in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion
u&s;ed therein, viz. that the captains are to keep the arms, for the u&s;e of
the militia, or &s;uch other u&s;es as his Maje&s;ty may have for them. This &s;erves to
di&s;quiet the minds of the common people: but the officers, and all others of better
&s;en&s;e, are &s;o well &s;atisfied with his Maje&s;ty's gracious and royal opinion, declared
to the advantage of all the church of England principles, that no &s;uch idle fear
enters their thoughts; but they wholly rely upon, and acquie&s;ce in, the a&s;&s;urances
given by his Maje&s;ty, who&s;e word, they know, is &s;acred and inviolable.</P>
<P><PB N="689" REF="715">
People's fears of troubles here are very great, e&s;pecially if the rebel Monmouth
&s;hould have any &s;ucce&s;s; which di&s;turbance breeds a great deal of ill blood here
between the Engli&s;h and the Iri&s;h; the latter charging this rebellion on the whole
body of the Engli&s;h, and telling them, that now their turn is come, and that they
will make the Engli&s;h of this country good &s;ubjects: and the Engli&s;h, on &s;uch
occa&s;ions, ju&s;tifying them&s;elves, and telling them, that though this be a rebellion
in England, yet it is only by the wor&s;t of the King's &s;ubjects there; and that there
are none, but his &s;ubjects of England, that: appear in the King's &s;ervice again&s;t
them; with abundance of other hot di&s;cour&s;es of this kind that run about the
country; the Iri&s;h charging all the Engli&s;h univer&s;ally, hardly three excepted in
all this country, as devoted to Monmouth, and not fit to be tru&s;ted by the King:
which language gives great offence and provocation to &s;uch of the Engli&s;h as hear
it, and admini&s;ters greater occa&s;ion of jealou&s;y between the Iri&s;h and them than
formerly; in&s;omuch as each &s;ay they are afraid the others will cut their throats.
And &s;ome, more fearful or di&s;affected than others, &s;peak of &s;ermons being in many
places preached, by the friars of this country, upon the 5th, 6th, and 7th ver&s;es
of the ninth chapter of Ezekiel; and though I cannot find any &s;uch &s;ermon any
where, by them preached, yet it &s;erves to amu&s;e and di&s;quiet the ignorant &s;ort of
people, and to prejudice the little trade that is going about the country; nobody
buying any thing of the countrymen: in&s;omuch that I have not been able to re|ceive
the &s;ixth part of my rent in money, and am fain to receive the re&s;t in beef or
corn, or to go without it.&mdash;The mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive of my friends, on this &s;ide
the water have been advi&s;ing me, upon &s;core of &s;ecurity, to cro&s;s the &s;ea, and to
go live privately in England; and, though I &s;ee not &s;o much cau&s;e to fear, or ex|pectation
of di&s;turbance, as they pretend to &s;ee, yet, becau&s;e they de&s;ired me to
move it to you, I de&s;ire the favour, of your advice about it. It is upon the advice
of our friends, that we have thoughts of &s;ending part of our &s;tocke of children,
