<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THE reflections of Cele&s;tina when &s;he
was alone were full of bitterne&s;s and an|gui&s;h.
It was in vain that &s;he wearied her|&s;elf
with conjectures on the cau&s;e of her
misfortune: &s;he could find no probability
in any that pre&s;ented them&s;elves. It could
not be caprice, nor that cruel delight
which men have &s;ometimes taken in wan|tonly
inflicting pain, and torturing by di&s;|appointment
the hearts they have taught
to love them, for of &s;uch conduct &s;he
knew Willoughby to be incapable; it
could not be a di&s;pute with Vava&s;our or
<PB N="2" REF="4">
any other young man, for &s;uch, however
alarming, mu&s;t &s;oon have been decided;
nor could it be any pecuniary difficulty
that had thus divided them, &s;ince Wil|loughby,
in talking over their future
pro&s;pects, had related to her the &s;ituation
of his fortune with the utmo&s;t clearne&s;s
and preci&s;ion; it could hardly be a prior
matrimonial engagement, for from his
infancy he had loved her, he had re|peatedly
told her that he never had the
lea&s;t partiality for any other woman, and
he was truth and candour it&s;elf; it could
not be any impediment rai&s;ed by the
Ca&s;tlenorths, for however great might be
their di&s;plea&s;ure and di&s;appointment, they
had no power over Willoughby's actions,
and he did not love them well enough to
make it probable that their per&s;ua&s;ions or
remon&s;trances could induce him to give
up the favourite project of his life, and
abandon her whom he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately loved
to di&s;grace and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
Whatever was the cau&s;e, however, of
the &s;udden re&s;olution he had taken, mi&s;ery
was certain: &s;he ob&s;erved that in the dia|logue
which Cathcart repeated as having
pa&s;&s;ed between him and Willoughby, no
mention was made of a probability of his
return&mdash;no hope thrown out, that their
union was rather &s;u&s;pended than put an
end to. All was dark and comfortle&s;s;
and in the my&s;tery which &s;urrounded the
whole affair, there was &s;omething of ter|ror
and apprehen&s;ion which &s;eemed more
in&s;upportable than the certainty of any evil
except Willoughby's death.</P>
<P>Cathcart, however, had given her a
motive to &s;upport her courage, in telling
her that nothing but the knowledge of her
bearing his lo&s;s without injury to her
health or her affection for him, could
&s;oothe or dimini&s;h the angui&s;h with which
Willoughby was him&s;elf oppre&s;&s;ed. "Let
me endeavour then," &s;aid &s;he, "to give
him this &s;atisfaction, as the la&s;t proof I
&s;hall perhaps ever be able to give him of
<PB N="4" REF="6">
my tender, my unalterable love. Con|demned
as I am to everla&s;ting regret,
da&s;hed from the &s;ummit of happine&s;s to
long and hopele&s;s &s;orrow for the re&s;t of
my life, let my re&s;olution in &s;uffering with
calmne&s;s &s;hew that I &s;hould have de|&s;erved
the happine&s;s which heaven once
&s;eemed to have &s;ettled as my lot. Heaven
only knows wherefore I am condemned to
lo&s;e and lament it."</P>
<P>The &s;olemn promi&s;e which Willoughby
had owned his mother had a&s;ked and re|ceived
of him in her la&s;t moments now
occurred to her. "Perhaps it is for the
intended breach of that promi&s;e," cried
&s;he, "that we are puni&s;hed: yet from
whence? the ear that heard it, the anxi|ous
maternal heart that obtained it, are
du&s;t! My benefactre&s;s comes not from the
grave to claim it: it was known only to
her, to her &s;on, and to me. Who is there
who could enforce it now, and to whom
would Willoughby li&s;ten, after obviating
<PB N="5" REF="7">
all the objections I urged again&s;t it's viola|tion?"</P>
<P>This fatal promi&s;e, however, had al|ways
hung heavy on the heart of Cele&s;tina,
even in her happie&s;t moments, and &s;he
&s;eemed now to be paying the price of hav|ing
ever con&s;ented to break it. Still, &s;till
the inexplicable my&s;tery remained; and
the hand from which the blow came that
had divided her and Willoughby was
equally hid in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>When a misfortune, however heavy, is
certain, the mind &s;inks re&s;i&s;tle&s;s beneath it;
and feeling all remedy ineffectual, it cea&s;es
all attempt to apply any: but this was
not the ca&s;e with Cele&s;tina: while the
cau&s;e of her being torn from Willoughby
was unknown, there appeared a po&s;&s;ibility
that it might be removed; and though he
had held out no &s;uch hope in his conver&s;a|tion
with Cathcart, her rea&s;on now &s;eized
this idea as her only re&s;ource. He had
be&s;ought her to bear their &s;eparation with
patience; he had hopes then &s;urely that it
<PB N="6" REF="8">
would end: he had entreated her not to
forget her affection for him; &s;urely he had
expectations then that he might again
claim it. Her &s;anguine temper encou|raged
the&s;e faint rays of comfort, which a
few moments before &s;eemed to be extin|gui&s;hed
for ever. The fir&s;t &s;hock was
pa&s;&s;ed; the tears &s;he had &s;hed had relieved
her overburthened heart, and &s;he prepared
with &s;ome degree of &s;erenity to go down to
Mr. Thorold, Cathcart, and Je&s;&s;y, and to
con&s;ult with them on what &s;he ought to do.</P>
<P>When &s;he again entered the room, the
little group which were a&s;&s;embled in it,
their melancholy and anxious looks, and
the different expectations with which their
meeting had been appointed, combined
to affect her, and to &s;hake the little re&s;o|lution
&s;he had with &s;o much difficulty ac|quired:
&s;he &s;at down, however, and Mr.
Thorold, with a degree of fatherly tender|ne&s;s,
approached her and took her hand.</P>
<P>"My dear young friend," &s;aid the ex|cellent
man, "this dignified compo&s;ure is
<PB N="7" REF="9">
worthy of your excellent under&s;tanding.
Do you think me de&s;erving the honour of
being your advi&s;er, if, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate
of circum&s;tances, you feel that you want
one?"</P>
<P>"I do indeed &s;everely feel," replied
Cele&s;tina faultering, "the nece&s;&s;ity of a
friend who is able to advi&s;e me; and where,
dear Sir, can I find one &s;o equal to it, if
you will but undertake the trouble."</P>
<P>"Well then," replied Mr. Thorold,
"we will not go over the occurrences that
have happened, nor attempt to account
for them: &s;ome unfore&s;een events have
divided you and my friend Willoughby,
and I am very &s;ure, that whatever they are,
they mu&s;t, if irretrievable, embitter the
re&s;t of his life: he wi&s;hes you, as I under|&s;tand
from Mr. Cathcart, to remain here at
lea&s;t till you have letters from him. Do you
intend to do &s;o?"</P>
<P>"I hardly know," an&s;wered Cele&s;tina
faintly, "what I ought to do."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
"It &s;eems to me," &s;aid Mr. Thorold,
"that whatever rea&s;on has had &s;o much
influence on him as to compel him to quit
you, &s;hould render your abode in his hou&s;e
improper."</P>
<P>"I will return then, Sir, &s;ince that is
your opinion, to the lodging I left at
Thorpe Heath."</P>
<P>"That will be very melancholy and
unplea&s;ant to you I fear."</P>
<P>"It certainly will: but what have I to
do now but to learn to &s;uffer? Local cir|cum&s;tances
will have little power to add
to the &s;orrow I mu&s;t endure, while uncer|tain
of what is become of Mr. Willoughby:
doubting whether I may not have been the
cau&s;e that &s;ome evil has befallen him, and
&s;ure of nothing&mdash;but that I mu&s;t be
wretched if I never &s;ee him again."</P>
<P>"I would very fain comfort without de|ceiving
you if I could. <HI>I hope you will</HI>
&s;ee him again: yet nothing &s;urely but &s;ome
very extraordinary event could have taken
him from you; but you hear that he was
<PB N="9" REF="11">
well&mdash;that he promi&s;ed to write to you:
it is po&s;&s;ible that letter may explain what
all our conjectures can do little in clear|ing
up: let us leave them, therefore; and
do you, my dear Mi&s;s de Mornay, re&s;olve
to fulfil his parting injunctions as far as
prudence will permit. I cannot &s;ay I ap|prove
of your &s;taying here, or of your go|ing
back to indulge your unea&s;ine&s;s in the
mournful &s;eclu&s;ion of your cottage; let me
propo&s;e therefore a middle way, by which
you will receive this expected letter with|out
quitting the neighbourhood, and be
ready to obey any wi&s;h of our dear Wil|loughby,
without receiving it at Thorpe
Heath, where you would have nobody to
a&s;&s;i&s;t you in it's execution. Will you go
home with me?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who already felt the value of
&s;uch a friend as &s;he &s;eemed to have ac|quired
in Mr. Thorold, and who fore&s;aw
that &s;he mu&s;t lo&s;e Je&s;&s;y, who could not
&s;tay long from her grandfather, would wil|lingly
have embraced this offer. She knew
<PB N="10" REF="12">
that Willoughby had the warme&s;t friend|&s;hip
for Mr. Thorold, and that he would
probably approve of &s;uch a propo&s;al; but
&s;he was unacquainted with his wife, and
dreaded to intrude her&s;elf into a family
where &s;he might find only the ma&s;ter of it
di&s;po&s;ed to receive her: &s;he objected there|fore
to the trouble &s;he &s;hould give, and to
the impropriety of introducing her&s;elf, thus
una&s;ked, to the acquaintance of his
lady; but Mr. Thorold obviated all her
objections, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he &s;hould have an
apartment to her&s;elf, and that his wife
would con&s;ider her as his daughter, his
daughter as her &s;i&s;ter; and Cele&s;tina, who
could not think without pain of going
alone to Thorpe Heath, which &s;he had
left with pro&s;pects &s;o very different, and
from whence her books and cloaths had
been removed, con&s;ented to go with Mr.
Thorold, and to remain with him at lea&s;t
till &s;he heard from Willoughby.</P>
<P>It was then &s;ettled that at lea&s;t part of
the original errand which had brought Mr.
<PB N="11" REF="13">
Thorold to Alve&s;tone &s;hould be completed,
and that Cathcart and Je&s;&s;y &s;hould be mar|ried,
&s;ince her father was already waiting
to give her away, and &s;ince Cathcart was
to remain at Alve&s;tone by the particular
directions of Willoughby on their parting.
Cele&s;tina could not be pre&s;ent at the cere|mony,
but while it was performing pre|pared
her&s;elf with as much re&s;olution as
&s;he could for her little journey. When
they returned from the altar, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed in
&s;ilence the weeping Je&s;&s;y, who clung round
her unable to bid her adieu: &s;he recom|mended
to Cathcart the clo&s;e&s;t adherence
to every injunction laid on him by Wil|loughby,
and be&s;ought him to come him|&s;elf
over to her with the expected letter as
&s;oon as it arrived; and then with faulter|ing
&s;teps went to the chai&s;e which was in
waiting for her by Mr. Thorold's orders.
He placed him&s;elf by her; and &s;he was
thus removed, probably as &s;he thought for
ever, from the hou&s;e, of which, only a few
<PB N="12" REF="14">
hours before, &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf as the
fortunate mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along the avenue, the
bench under one of the great elms, where
&s;he had &s;o often &s;at with Willoughby in
their childhood, and where only a few
days before he had been recalling tho&s;e
delightful times to her recollection, &s;truck
her mo&s;t: it looked like a monument to
the memory of lo&s;t happine&s;s! As the
great gate of the park &s;hut after the car|riage,
&s;he felt exiled for ever from the
only &s;pot in the world that contained any
odject intere&s;ting to her; and though little
di&s;po&s;ed to think of poetry, almo&s;t invo|luntarily
repeated&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>O unexpected &s;troke, wor&s;e than of death,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t I then leave thee paradi&s;e? thus leave</L>
<L>Thee native &s;oil, the&s;e happy walks and &s;hades!</L></Q>
<P>Mr. Thorold, to whom &s;orrow was &s;a|cred,
attempted not to call off her thoughts
from their pre&s;ent mournful employment;
but glad to &s;ee that her &s;orrow broke not
<PB N="13" REF="15">
out in tho&s;e violent and convul&s;ive expre&s;|&s;ions
which many women would have
given way to, he contented him&s;elf with
admini&s;tering to her in &s;ilence all the
offices of friend&s;hip; and when they ar|rived
at his hou&s;e, which was about five
miles from Alve&s;tone, he got out and went
in fir&s;t to prepare his family for the recep|tion
of their unexpected vi&s;itor. After a
few moments he returned, and a&s;&s;ured her
that both Mrs. Thorold and his daughter
would be happy to &s;ee her, and think
them&s;elves honoured by her abode with
them; "but," added he, "perhaps you
had rather go to your own chamber than
be introduced immediately to &s;trangers."
Cele&s;tina had already repented of having
accepted Mr. Thorold's offer, however
friendly it was, and felt that in her pre|&s;ent
&s;tate of mind the mo&s;t forlorn &s;olitude
would have been better for her than the
re&s;traint &s;he mu&s;t unavoidably &s;ubmit to,
and the enquiries that, if not by words,
the looks of all who &s;aw her would make
<PB N="14" REF="16">
into the cau&s;e of the &s;trange revolution that
had happened in her circum&s;tances: but it
was now too late to retreat, and &s;he deter|mined
to go through at once a ceremony,
the delay of which would not render it le&s;s
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, therefore, with more &s;tea|dine&s;s
of voice than could be expected, that
&s;he could not too &s;oon avail her&s;elf of
Mrs. Thorold's kindne&s;s, and was imme|diately
introduced to her and her only un|married
daughter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Thorold was what the world agrees
to call a very good &s;ort of woman, but one
of tho&s;e who are be&s;t de&s;cribed by nega|tives;
&s;he had no po&s;itive failings, but a
&s;ort of feminine pride, which made her
very anxious that none of her neighbours,
at lea&s;t none of the rank of private gentle|women,
&s;hould have hand&s;omer cloaths, or
better furniture, or a nicer hou&s;e; and
while &s;he carefully guarded her own dig|nity,
&s;he indulged &s;omewhat too much
curio&s;ity in enquiring into the minute&s;t par|ticular
<PB N="15" REF="17">
by which the con&s;equence of others
could be dimini&s;hed or encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold, who&s;e &s;trong under&s;tand|ing
taught him to &s;ee and bear her foibles,
had taken the utmo&s;t pains to check in his
daughters a propen&s;ity to imitate them.
The three elder had been married &s;ome
years, and were &s;ettled in the neighbour|hood
of London. Arabella, the younge&s;t,
was now about two and twenty, rather
pretty in her per&s;on, and plea&s;ing in her
manners: with much of her father's &s;en&s;e,
&s;he had a little of the vanity of her mother;
but it had taken another turn: though &s;he
dre&s;&s;ed fa&s;hionably, and her &s;i&s;ters always
took care, by &s;ending her the newe&s;t modes
from London, to enable her to give the
<HI>ton</HI> in that remote country, &s;he piqued her|&s;elf
le&s;s on that advantage than on being
reckoned extremely accompli&s;hed. In
con&s;equence of this rage, &s;he played on
&s;everal kinds of in&s;truments mechanically,
for &s;he had no ear, and &s;ung in a feigned
voice, for nature had denied her a natural
<PB N="16" REF="18">
one. In languages &s;he was more &s;ucce&s;s|ful:
under the in&s;tructions of her father
&s;he had early been taught Latin, and that
knowledge facilitated her acquiring the
French and Italian, which &s;he wrote and
under&s;tood better than &s;he &s;poke them:
&s;he took likene&s;&s;es in crayons; painted
land&s;kapes in oil; and the apartments
were furni&s;hed with her wor&s;ted works and
embroidery.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina had hardly gone through the
fir&s;t ceremonies of her reception than &s;he
found a relief from the inqui&s;itive looks of
the mother and daughter, in admiring
the&s;e performances. "You do my trifling
productions a great deal of honour," &s;aid
Mi&s;s Thorold, "and your prai&s;e cannot
fail of being very gratifying to me, as I
under&s;tand you are your&s;elf &s;o extremely
accompli&s;hed."</P>
<P>"Indeed," an&s;wered Cele&s;tina, "you
have been mi&s;informed. I can boa&s;t of
no &s;uch advantage: but I am extremely
fond of mu&s;ic and of drawing, and u&s;ed to
<PB N="17" REF="19">
plea&s;e a very partial friend by attempting
them: &s;ince her death, my time has pa&s;&s;ed
in a very un&s;ettled way, and I have now
no motive to tempt me to recover what
in that de&s;ultory life I have lo&s;t of the little
I knew."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Thorold, who had heard Cele&s;tina
repre&s;ented as excelling, was not &s;orry to
find &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no &s;uch very great ad|vantages
over her; and Cele&s;tina, to whom
any thing was preferable to conver&s;ation,
pre&s;&s;ing her to &s;it down to the harp&s;ichord,
&s;he complied with that air of confidence
which the certainty of excelling gives; and
till dinner &s;he continued to play &s;onatas
and le&s;&s;ons, all of which Cele&s;tina failed
not to applaud, though &s;he had &s;o little
idea of what &s;he heard, that &s;he could not
have a&s;&s;igned one to it's proper compo&s;er:
her thoughts were fled after Willoughby;
and from the &s;trange rever&s;e &s;he had experienced,
nothing had power to detach
them. Dinner, tea, and &s;upper, at length
were over; the pre&s;ence of Mr. Thorold
<PB N="18" REF="20">
prevented his wife from a&s;king que&s;tions
which were every moment ri&s;ing to her
lips; and Cele&s;tina was permitted to retire
to her own room at an early hour. The
extreme fatigue &s;he had &s;uffered the night
before, and the &s;olicitude of &s;pirit &s;he had
endured for &s;o many hours, had &s;o ex|hau&s;ted
nature that &s;he &s;unk into &s;lumber;
but it was di&s;turbed and broken by hideous
dreams. In the morning, however, &s;he
found her&s;elf better: her mind had not yet
recovered from it's con&s;ternation, but &s;he
could now think of all that had happened
with more &s;teadine&s;s. In the letter &s;he
expected from Willoughby, &s;he had &s;ome|thing
to look forward to, which might al|leviate
but could not encrea&s;e her anxiety,
as whatever cleared up the my&s;tery would,
&s;he thought, be a relief to her, and cer|tainty,
however painful, &s;he was &s;ure &s;he
could endure better than wild conjectures
and terrifying &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="19" REF="21">
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the following day pa&s;&s;ed without
any tidings of Cathcart, in &s;earch of
whom the anxious eyes of Cele&s;tina were
continually turned towards the window.
Mr. Thorold went out to his farm and
among his pari&s;hioners in his u&s;ual way,
and had charged his wife to let Cele&s;tina
be mi&s;tre&s;s of her time, and not to impor|tune
her with que&s;tions or even with con|ver&s;ation:
to Arabella al&s;o he had given
the &s;ame injunctions: but the native po|litene&s;s
of Cele&s;tina had made both the
ladies believe &s;he was plea&s;ed by their
conver&s;ation and intere&s;ted in their con|cerns,
and to avoid the appearance of
rudene&s;s or &s;ingularity, Cele&s;tina now
forced her&s;elf into &s;ome degree of atten|tion
<PB N="20" REF="22">
to their endeavours to entertain her,
li&s;tened to the details Mrs. Thorold gave
of the affairs of the neighbourhood, and
gave her daughter her opinion of the
mo&s;t elegant mixture of colours in a work|bag
&s;he was compo&s;ing for one of her
&s;i&s;ters, heard with patient politele&s;s a long
poem, written by young Thorold, who
was now at Oxford, and a&s;&s;ented to the
ju&s;tice of Arabella's complaints that there
was very little rational &s;ociety in the coun|try,
that every body now for&s;ook their
di&s;tant &s;eats to pa&s;s their &s;ummers at
&s;ome watering place, and that unle&s;s one
could enter into the amu&s;ements of an in|ferior
circle, there was to be found in the
country no amu&s;ement at all.</P>
<P>So pa&s;&s;ed the long long day, and ano|ther
and another in the &s;ame manner,
relieved by nothing but the &s;ilent though
tender &s;ympathy with which Mr. Thorold
him&s;elf &s;eemed to enter into the feelings of
his fair, unhappy gue&s;t. He looked at
her with eyes that told her all the concern
<PB N="21" REF="23">
her &s;ituation gave him; and appeared
hurt that both his wife and daughter, though
they behaved to her with all the attention
and kindne&s;s po&s;&s;ible, &s;eemed not to un|der&s;tand,
that on a mind like hers, in its
pre&s;ent &s;ituation, the common occurrences
of life could not be obtruded but to pain
and fatigue. He however &s;poke not to
them, of what, he feared, they had not
delicacy of feeling enough to comprehend;
but knowing of the expected letter from
Willoughby, he became towards the noon
of the fourth day almo&s;t as anxious for
its arrival, and almo&s;t as unea&s;y at its long
delay, as Cele&s;tina her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Her &s;olicitude was by that time become
in&s;upportable. She could no longer con|ceal
it under the appearance of attending
to her ho&s;ts; but took the opportunity of
Mrs. Thorold's being engaged in dome&s;tic
bu&s;ine&s;s, and Arabella at her mu&s;ic, to
&s;teal into the garden; where &s;he hid her&s;elf
in a &s;ort of alcove cut in an hedge of holly
and other evergreens that bounded the
<PB N="22" REF="24">
garden towards the road, and there gave
way to the tormenting apprehen&s;ions that
corroded her heart. It was now Tue&s;day:
Willoughby had been gone &s;ince the pre|ceding
Wedne&s;day evening; and had he
gone to London immediately, and written
from thence as he promi&s;ed, the letter
mu&s;t long &s;ince have reached Cathcart by
the return of the po&s;t: but &s;he knew that
unle&s;s he was greatly changed it was not
to the po&s;t he would entru&s;t the convey|ance
of a letter on which her exi&s;tence
perhaps depended; the delay therefore ag|gravated
all the terrors &s;he felt; but ano|ther
day pa&s;t, and &s;he was &s;till obliged to
endure them. To di&s;gui&s;e her di&s;tre&s;s
however was impracticable; and without
hoping to impo&s;e upon her friends by &s;o
common an artifice, &s;he was at length com|pelled
to &s;ay, that &s;he had an head ach
which was very &s;evere unle&s;s when &s;he was
in the open air; and that &s;he was rendered
by it quite incapable of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">
Having thus obtained the liberty of wan|dering
alone in the garden, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
there the whole morning of Wedne&s;day:
&s;ometimes reflecting with the bittere&s;t re|gret
on the different pro&s;pects which were
before her on the Wedne&s;day of the pre|ceding
week, and &s;ometimes bewildering
her&s;elf in conjectures, on the cau&s;e of their
having thus vani&s;hed from her.</P>
<P>Spring had within that period made a
rapid progre&s;s; but Cele&s;tina no longer
heeded the beauties that &s;urrounded her:
hers was now that &s;tate of mind when&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>'Tis nought but gloom around; the darken'd Sun</L>
<L>Lo&s;es his light; the ro&s;y-bo&s;om'd Spring</L>
<L>To weeping Fancy pines, and yon bright arch,</L>
<L>Contracted, bends into a du&s;ky vault:&mdash;</L>
<L>All Nature fades extinct&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thom&s;on.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>Even flowers, of which &s;he was pa&s;&s;ionately
fond, had lo&s;t the influence they once had
over her fancy. She &s;aw them not; or
&s;eeing them, only recollected that Wil|loughby
<PB N="34" REF="26">
had &s;hewn her at Alve&s;tone a bed
of &s;uch hyacinths, who&s;e bloom and fra|grance
he had fondly anticipated, knowing
how much &s;he delighted in them: &s;he
remembered with a &s;igh each particular
leaf and blo&s;&s;om that compo&s;ed the la&s;t
no&s;egay he gathered for her, on the morn|ing
of that day, when they were divided,
never, as &s;he now feared&mdash;to meet again!</P>
<P>Such were her &s;ad recollections, as, hardly
knowing what &s;he did, &s;he traver&s;ed the
gra&s;s walk which was divided by a hedge
of evergreens from the road. Her mourn|ful
reverie was interrupted by the &s;ound of
hor&s;es feet. She flew to the gate: it was
Cathcart! who on perceiving her threw
him&s;elf from his hor&s;e and gave her the
long expected letter, which &s;he received
with &s;uch marks of extreme agitation, that
Cathcart, afraid &s;he would fall, left his
hor&s;e to find it's way to the &s;table, and
came to &s;upport her.</P>
<P>She leaned on his arm, attempting to
<PB N="25" REF="27">
&s;peak, and after a moment's pau&s;e &s;aid&mdash;"Cathcart,
you have had a letter al&s;o?"</P>
<P>"I have."</P>
<P>"Before I have courage to open my
own, tell me&mdash;is Willoughby well? and
are there hopes of our &s;eeing him again?"</P>
<P>"He is well," an&s;wered Cathcart; but
of &s;eeing him again he gives me no hopes:
to you, perhaps, he may be, and I hope
is more explicit."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina &s;taid not to reply; but hurry|ing
as well as &s;he was able to her own
room, tore open her letter, which was in
the&s;e words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>April 3, 1788.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>What mu&s;t be the mi&s;ery the man
endures, who only a few days &s;ince had
the immediate pro&s;pect of calling Ce|le&s;tina
his, and who is now compelled
not only to leave her, but to leave her
uncertain whether he may ever again
dare to entertain that hope&mdash;whether he
&s;hall ever &s;ee her more!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28">
How I have loved you, Cele&s;tina&mdash;how
I &s;till love you&mdash;I &s;urely need not
repeat. This pa&s;&s;ion you well know&mdash;
<Q>Grew with my growth, and &s;trengthen'd with my
&s;trength:</Q>
you will not therefore believe that any
circum&s;tance can dimini&s;h&mdash;any time
efface it. Yet &s;uch are the barriers
that may be between us, that perhaps
I may never dare again to &s;ee you; or
only when I have &s;ubmitted to the
dreadful &s;acrifice required of me, and
given my hand to one to whom my
heart mu&s;t ever be a &s;tranger: and
yet, Cele&s;tina, if to this I ever do
&s;ubmit, it will only be to enable me to
place you in the &s;ituation you de&s;erve as
to fortune, and becau&s;e it matters not,
if I cannot pa&s;s my life with you, with
whom it may be my de&s;tiny to pa&s;s
it; for then, it mu&s;t in every event
be equally unhappy. Cele&s;tina! I am
aware of the appearance my conduct
<PB N="27" REF="29">
mu&s;t have in your eyes; aware of it
without having the power to explain
it. I have &s;worn that I will not un|veil
this fatal my&s;tery till I either can
&s;ee you, with all tho&s;e delicious hopes
<HI>unempoi&s;oned</HI> that were &s;o lately mine,
or till I have learned to regard you&mdash;not
with le&s;s affection, for that is im|po&s;&s;ible,
but with&mdash;I bewilder my|&s;elf&mdash;I
know not what I would &s;ay&mdash;only
let this be under&s;tood as my mean|ing,
that wherever I may be, or what|ever
I may become, my fonde&s;t affec|tions,
my love, my e&s;teem, mu&s;t be
yours. It is more than probable that I
&s;hall go abroad; and you, Cele&s;tina,
whither will you go? Suffer me to
name my wi&s;hes, though I hardly dare
hope you will comply with them&mdash;Why
&s;hould you not &s;tay at Alve&s;tone? If
<HI>ever I return to it,</HI> you will be it's
mi&s;tre&s;s; if I never return, you might
find a melancholy plea&s;ure&mdash;But again
I am wandering from my point: I will
<PB N="28" REF="30">
not dictate to you, my lovely friend, I,
who am incapable of judging what I
ought to do for my&s;elf; for in the mid&s;t
of my reflections a thou&s;and bitter
po&s;&s;ibilities di&s;tract me: Cele&s;tina may
renounce me as unworthy of her; may
learn to de&s;pi&s;e me, or what is yet
more dreadful, &s;he may learn to love
another. Oh! Cele&s;tina! &s;hould this
ever happen&mdash;&s;hould you ever give
that heart, which it was the glory of
my life to po&s;&s;e&s;s, to another!&mdash;and
yet, &s;ituated as I may find my&s;elf, it
may perhaps be&mdash;But I mu&s;t con|clude
while I am able, and call off my
thoughts from my&s;elf, to promote Ce|le&s;tina's
future comforts, if I can yet
contribute to it, who have perhaps been
it's de&s;troyer.</P>
<P>Do not write to me. Expre&s;&s;ions of
your anxiety and regret I cannot bear.
It is as much as I can now do to keep
my &s;en&s;es. Gracious heaven! that ever
<PB N="29" REF="31">
I &s;hould &s;ay to Cele&s;tina, do not write
to me!</P>
<P>Cathcart has my directions how to
act in all pecuniary matters at Alve&s;tone,
and to &s;tay in the hou&s;e till he takes
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own, which I &s;uppo&s;e
will be as &s;oon as old Winnington dies:
then he will continue to &s;uperintend the
farm, and to receive the rents, out of
which I have directed him to pay you
fifty guineas every quarter, and to an|&s;wer
any farther demands that you may
make upon him: and you mu&s;t not,
Cele&s;tina, refu&s;e this; for remember that
the ma&s;ter of the whole fortune &s;hould
now have been your's, and that you
have a right to this trifle&mdash;perhaps to
much more. But if the&s;e rea&s;ons are
in&s;ufficient to conquer your reluctance,
remember, Cele&s;tina, that Willoughby,
the unhappy Willoughby a&s;ks it of you,
as the greate&s;t alleviation his wretched|ne&s;s
now admits of.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">
Wherever you are, let Cathcart give
me con&s;tant information; and whenever
I can tell you that the weight which now
pre&s;&s;es on my heart is removed, I will
write&mdash;write! no I will then fly to my
Cele&s;tina from the extremity of the
earth. Perhaps I may now be in a few
days on the &s;ea; but I go no farther
but to the South of Europe. Cele&s;tina,
it would be a very great comfort to me
to hear from Cathcart, before I go,
what you intend to do: it would be a
&s;till greater to know that you deter|mine
to remain at lea&s;t this &s;ummer at
Alve&s;tone: but you are now with a
mo&s;t excellent man, who is capable of
advi&s;ing you: in him, Cele&s;tina, you
will have a friend and protector.</P>
<P>Oh! why is it my lot to refer you
to another for protection, when to be
your friend, your lover, your hu&s;band,
was &s;o lately the fir&s;t hope, as it has
ever been the fir&s;t with of my exi&s;tence.
But I am running again into u&s;ele&s;s re|petition.
<PB N="31" REF="33">
Cele&s;tina, if I ever &s;eemed
worthy of your regard, give not away
ha&s;tily tho&s;e affections which were
mine! If ever I can claim them again&mdash;we
may be happy; if not&mdash;but I can|not

<CLOSER><SIGNED>GEORGE WILLOUGHBY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Cele&s;tina read over this letter the fir&s;t
time in &s;uch perturbation, that except a
general notion that notwith&s;tanding Wil|loughby
had <HI>involuntarily</HI> left her they
&s;hould meet no more, &s;he had very little
idea of it's contents.</P>
<P>Her's were &s;en&s;ations of angui&s;h which
no appeal to friend&s;hip, no participation of
her &s;entiments with another, could mitigate
or appea&s;e. Cathcart knew no more of the
motives of Willoughby's conduct than &s;he
did her&s;elf; Mr. Thorold was equally ig|norant;
<PB N="32" REF="34">
and to neither of them could &s;he
look for con&s;olation. She tried to recover
her compo&s;ure; &s;he a &s;econd time read the
letter: it grew more and more inexplica|ble;
and after having anxiou&s;ly waited for
it &s;o many days, it's arrival &s;eemed now
only either to embarra&s;s her with new
conjectures, or to torment her with appre|hen&s;ions
of his marrying Mi&s;s Fitz-Hay|man,
for to that the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;en|tence
evidently alluded. Nothing but the
natural &s;trength of her under&s;tanding could
have &s;upported her under the fir&s;t tumultu|ous
&s;en&s;ations of redoubled con&s;ternation
and wild conjecture, which now a&s;&s;ailed
her. The longer &s;he &s;tudied the letter, the
more impo&s;&s;ible &s;he found any explana|tion
of Willoughby's conduct: &s;till the
a&s;&s;urances of his un&s;haken attachment
&s;weetened the bitterne&s;s of her de&s;tiny; he
was living; he &s;till loved her; her &s;ituation,
therefore, however unea&s;y, was not de&s;pe|rate;
and, as the fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at the
incomprehen&s;ible contents of a letter, which
<PB N="33" REF="35">
was expected to clear up every doubt,
&s;ub&s;ided, &s;he &s;aw le&s;s cau&s;e of de&s;pondence,
and again &s;he examined every &s;eparate pa|ragraph,
trying to extract from all that
would bear it, &s;omething to cheri&s;h that
hope, without which her exi&s;tence would
have been in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>Every reque&s;t of Willoughby had with
her the force of a command; but that he
made in regard to her continuing at Al|ve&s;tone
was &s;o worded, as if he hardly
him&s;elf thought &s;he ought to comply with
it. The impropriety of it appeared evi|dent;
but in every other in&s;tance &s;he de|termined
to be governed by his wi&s;hes,
and as far as was now in her power to con|tribute
to his &s;atisfaction by affording him
all the con&s;olation that depended upon
her. Of the plea&s;ure of living for a
beloved object, though perhaps per&s;onally
di&s;united for ever, of believing that where|ever
he was, her ea&s;e and happine&s;s were
ever in his thoughts, &s;he was fully &s;en&s;ible;
and &s;he now found in it a con&s;olation &s;o
<PB N="34" REF="36">
&s;oothing to her mind, that &s;he was &s;oon
enabled to return to Cathcart, who waited
for her in the parlour, with more compo|&s;ure
than on her leaving him it was likely
&s;he would &s;oon obtain. She found her&s;elf
unequal to entering on a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the
letter, which &s;he gave Cathcart to read;
and on his returning it in &s;ilence, but with
a look &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of his a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
&s;he told him, that nothing re|mained
but for them to fulfil as nearly as
po&s;&s;ible all the injunctions of Willoughby.
"He de&s;ires me not to write to him," &s;aid
&s;he. "Even in that I &s;hall, with what|ever
reluctance, obey him at pre&s;ent, and
&s;o I certainly &s;hall in what relates to fol|lowing
the advice of Mr. Thorold. A
little time will be nece&s;&s;ary before I can
fix on any plan of life: but as my dear
Willoughby expects to hear of me from
you, tell him that I bear our &s;eparation,
cruel as it is, with fortitude and calmne&s;s,
convinced as I am that our connection is
not broken by any cau&s;e that ought to
<PB N="35" REF="37">
make me blu&s;h that it had ever been in|tended."
She &s;topped a moment to re|cover
her voice, which faultered and almo&s;t
failed, and then added&mdash;"No, Cathcart,
whatever has divided us, I have the firme&s;t
reliance on Willoughby's honour."</P>
<P>"And on his love," &s;aid Cathcart,
"you may, dear Madam, with equal
firmne&s;s rely: and though the&s;e perfect
convictions render this &s;trange &s;eparation
more wonderful, they will I tru&s;t &s;u&s;tain
your courage through it&mdash;I &s;ay through
it, becau&s;e I am almo&s;t certain it will be
of no long duration."</P>
<P>"Ah! Cathcart!" cried Cele&s;tina
mournfully, "I would I could think &s;o!
But it is indeed very fruitle&s;s and very pain|ful
to enter again on the&s;e bewildering
conjectures, in which, as there is no end,
there is little u&s;e: and I have need of all
my &s;pirits to enable me to &s;upport an evil,
for which I cannot account; I will not
therefore wa&s;te them in gue&s;&s;ing or lament|ing
but employ them to obey him to whom
<PB N="36" REF="38">
my heart mu&s;t, in every change of circum|&s;tance,
and though I were certain never
more to &s;ee him, be fondly and faithfully
devoted. Tell him &s;o, my good friend:
tell him how well I bear this &s;evere blow,
more &s;evere as coming from an unknown
hand; and a&s;&s;ure him that if he will allow
me to write to him, I will not di&s;tre&s;s him
by u&s;ele&s;s complaints, or aggravate his
&s;orrow by repre&s;enting my own."</P>
<P>Again &s;he &s;topped, while Cathcart ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his admiration of her ju&s;t and noble
re&s;olutions; and after a moment, finding
the exertion too much for her, &s;he added
ha&s;tily&mdash;"tell him thus much, Cathcart,
in the letter you will of cour&s;e write to
him this afternoon; and tell him that your
next letter &s;hall inform him, if it is &s;till
unea&s;y to him to receive a letter from me,
of the arrangements I will make under the
guidance of Mr. Thorold for my future
life: but &s;ay, that they will be &s;uch as
will render his generous intentions as to
pecuniary matters needle&s;s. I would fain
<PB N="37" REF="39">
explain my thoughts in that re&s;pect; but
in truth I am not able ju&s;t now. Some
hours of reflection will be nece&s;&s;ary to me.
Farewel, therefore, dear Cathcart, for this
morning; I &s;hall of cour&s;e &s;ee you again
in a few days."</P>
<P>Cathcart a&s;&s;ured her he would be with
her again the following Friday; or the in|tervening
day, if he received any new in|telligence
from Willoughby. She then
charged him with many kind wi&s;hes and
remembrances to Je&s;&s;y, who was now, he
told her, &s;o confined by her grandfather
that &s;he could not get to her, and then
took his leave to return to Alve&s;tone, and
execute the wi&s;hes of Willoughby by giv|ing
him a minute detail of all that had
pa&s;&s;ed with Cele&s;tina.</P>

<PB N="38" REF="40">
<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Thorold, who was informed that
Cele&s;tina had received letters from Wil|loughby,
felt a true friendly impatience to
know their contents: but feeling al&s;o how
much his lovely gue&s;t mu&s;t in any event
be agitated, he not only forbore to intrude
upon her with any enquiries him&s;elf, but
in order that &s;he might not &s;uffer even
from the looks of his family, which he
knew could not fail to expre&s;s &s;olicitude
ari&s;ing from le&s;s generous motives, he &s;ent
her up a note to her own apartment, in
which he begged &s;he would not come
down to dinner, to put her&s;elf, through
form, into any &s;ituation that might be in
any degree painful. This exemption was
particularly gratifying to her, as the
<PB N="39" REF="41">
younger Thorold was this day expected at
dinner, and was to remain at home for
&s;ome weeks; and his elder brother, a
Captain in the army, who had been &s;ome
time in Ireland, was to meet him in the
evening. Cele&s;tina was unfit for com|pany,
and above all, the company of &s;tran|gers;
and again &s;he regretted that in the
fir&s;t un&s;ettled tumult of her &s;pirits &s;he had
agreed to Mr. Thorold's propo&s;al, in&s;tead
of going back to the lodgings &s;he had
formerly inhabited: &s;he was now, how|ever,
compelled to remain where &s;he was,
till &s;he could determine, with the advice
of Mr. Thorold, whither to go. She
thought it probable that he might wi&s;h
her to remain with him; but to this, ex|cept
his friendly regard for her, and the
advantage of being near Cathcart and
Je&s;&s;y, &s;he had no inducement; and where|ever
&s;he was, &s;he determined it &s;hould not
be as a mere vi&s;itor for any length of time,
but that &s;he would pay for her board.
Again the quiet and liberty of her cottage
<PB N="40" REF="42">
on the heath recurred to her; but when
&s;he enjoyed that quiet, her heart had not
undergone tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of happine&s;s
and mi&s;ery, which had now, &s;he greatly
feared, excluded tranquillity from her
bo&s;om for ever; what had then afforded
her a &s;pecies of melancholy plea&s;ure, the
di&s;tant view of a &s;pot in Alve&s;tone Park,
would now &s;erve only to render her more
unhappy, and to encourage that tendency
to repine, which her rea&s;on told her &s;he
&s;hould, both on Willoughby's account and
her own, rather re&s;olve to conquer than
endeavour to indulge: &s;he believed, how|ever,
that if once &s;ome re&s;olution was
formed as to her future re&s;idence, &s;he
&s;hould be ea&s;ier her&s;elf, and be better
able to &s;atisfy Willoughby. To this &s;ub|ject,
therefore, &s;he turned her thoughts,
and examined with a heavy heart &s;everal
different plans that offered them&s;elves to
her mind.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more comfortle&s;s than
her reflections: &s;he was not only an or|phan,
<PB N="41" REF="43">
and a &s;tranger in England, but
knew not whether there was in the world
any being who&s;e protection &s;he had the
remote&s;t right to claim. Lady Molyneux
had never written to her &s;ince their &s;epara|tion,
and even if Willoughby &s;hould ap|prove
of her again &s;eeking the protection
of his &s;i&s;ter, which &s;he had great rea&s;on to
doubt, &s;he knew not whether Matilda and
her hu&s;band would receive her; and from
that want of heart &s;he had too often di&s;covered
in them both, &s;he could not think
of making the experiment. She had no
intimacy with any other per&s;on; for though
many of the families &s;he had been accu&s;|tomed
to vi&s;it while Mrs. Willoughby
lived, had daughters, who had cultivated
an acquaintance with her, &s;he had already
&s;een enough of the general conduct of the
world to know that &s;he &s;hould now be no
longer an acceptable gue&s;t, and that an
individual to whom court is made a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly,
while &s;hining as an equal among
fa&s;hionable circles, is &s;oon forgotten; or
<PB N="42" REF="44">
if remembered, de&s;pi&s;ed, when tho&s;e ad|ventitious
advantages &s;urround her no lon|ger.
She had heard from Vava&s;our, for
Willoughby him&s;elf had always carefully
avoided the &s;ubject, that the &s;udden de&s;er|tion
of Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, to whom Wil|loughby
was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o firmly en|gaged,
and his re&s;olution of marrying his
mother's adopted daughter, had been very
much talked of in the exten&s;ive circle who
were connected or acquainted with the fa|mily:
&s;he could not doubt but that their
&s;udden &s;eparation on the very eve of their
marriage was as generally known; and had
&s;he found any temptation to return to the
&s;ociety &s;he had quitted, this painful cer|tainty,
the prying curio&s;ity that would be
excited, and the malicious conjecture that
would be made, would effectually have
counteracted it.</P>
<P>Towards evening &s;he found &s;ufficient
courage to entreat Mr. Thorold's attention
for half an hour. He came to her imme|diately,
<PB N="43" REF="45">
and &s;he put into his hands the
letter &s;he had received from Willoughby.</P>
<P>He read it with great attention, and as
it &s;hould &s;eem with great concern, and
then, in the expre&s;&s;ive manner that was
u&s;ual with him, gave it back to her with|out
&s;peaking.</P>
<P>Benevolence and pity were now vi&s;ible
in his features, which were ma&s;culine,
&s;trong, and frequently &s;tern; but Cele&s;tina
was hardly enough accu&s;tomed to him to
under&s;tand his &s;ilence completely. "You
&s;ee, dear Sir," &s;aid &s;he timidly&mdash;"you
&s;ee that Willoughby refers me to you, and
I would very fain avail my&s;elf of the bene|fit
of your advice."</P>
<P>"It is always at your &s;ervice," replied
Mr. Thorold; "but on what occa&s;ion do
you now a&s;k it?"</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h to know," replied &s;he with
&s;till greater he&s;itation, "what you think
it advi&s;able for me to do? where you think
I ought to &s;ettle my&s;elf?"</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">
"I am &s;orry," an&s;wered he, "you
think it &s;o &s;oon nece&s;&s;ary to turn your
thoughts that way. I hoped that you
would &s;tay here at lea&s;t for &s;ome weeks;
and really I can give you no other advice
than to do &s;o. The my&s;tery which I can|not
develope, may by that time be re|moved,
and we &s;hall have time not only
to hear more of Willoughby, but if no|thing
occurs on his part to re-e&s;tabli&s;h you
at Alve&s;tone, to ca&s;t about for a proper
and permanent &s;ituation for you: think no
more, therefore, my dear ward, for &s;uch
I con&s;ider you, of leaving us at pre&s;ent,
and rather exert your admirable under|&s;tanding
in quieting your &s;pirits, and in
acquiring fortitude to bear adver&s;ity and
evil, if they &s;hould be finally your por|tion;
or equality of temper to enjoy, what
it is more difficult to enjoy well&mdash;happine&s;s
and pro&s;perity"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina would now liave &s;poken of the
inconvenience to which &s;o long a vi&s;it
might put his family, and the little claim
<PB N="45" REF="47">
&s;he had to &s;uch unu&s;ual kindne&s;s from him
and Mrs. Thorold; but he &s;uffered her
not to continue the&s;e apologies, &s;eemed
little plea&s;ed that &s;he attempted to make
them; and then re-a&s;&s;uming his good hu|mour,
he left her, bidding her try to re|cover
her looks, and to di&s;mi&s;s as much
as &s;he could from her mind the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing
events of the la&s;t ten days.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina now found that &s;he could not
immediately remove without offending the
friend to whom Willoughby had recom|mended
her, and prepared, &s;ince &s;he could
not be indulged with &s;olitude, to mix with
his family, and be as little as po&s;&s;ible a
weight on tho&s;e, who, whatever might
be their good humour, could not be ex|pected
to enter into her &s;orrows; the next
morning therefore at breakfa&s;t &s;he joined
Mrs. Thorold, her daughter, and her two
&s;ons, to both of whom &s;he was immediately
introduced, and from who&s;e &s;crutinizing
looks &s;he &s;ought refuge in talking with
forced cheerfulne&s;s to Arabella.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">
Captain Thorold was the elde&s;t of the
family, and Montague the younge&s;t.
The former of the&s;e young men had been
adopted by his uncle, who, after a life
pa&s;&s;ed in the army, had died a general
officer at a very advanced age, and had
left his nephew his whole fortune, which
was near fifteen hundred a year, after the
death of his wife, who &s;urviving him
only a twelvemonth, Captain Thorold had
now been &s;ome time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
e&s;tate, and of a con&s;iderable &s;um of money.</P>
<P>But accu&s;tomed from his infancy to the
un&s;ettled life of a &s;oldier, he &s;till continued
it from habit and choice; and though his
father and his family were very &s;olicitous
to have him marry and &s;ettle near them,
he &s;eemed to have no inclination to re&s;ign
his freedom for the plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic
&s;ociety. Novelty and amu&s;ement were
his pur&s;uits, and his fortune gave him the
power to indulge him&s;elf. He had what
is generally called a very hand&s;ome per|&s;on;
but without his military air, his figure
<PB N="47" REF="49">
would have been rather e&s;teemed clum&s;y
than graceful. He had lived much among
the circles who give the ton, dre&s;&s;ed well,
and had that &s;ort of under&s;tanding which
recommended him to general &s;ociety, and
particularly to that of the ladies, with
whom he was an almo&s;t univer&s;al favourite,
and who had agreed to call him the hand|&s;ome
Thorold, even before he became
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fortune, which in the opinion
of mo&s;t of the belles at country quarters,
and &s;till more in the opinion of their mo|thers,
more than redoubled his attractions.
Thus &s;poiled from his fir&s;t entrance into
life, he had learned to con&s;ider him&s;elf as
irre&s;i&s;tible, and &s;uppo&s;ed every woman he
&s;aw his own, if he cho&s;e to take the trou|ble
of &s;ecuring her.</P>
<P>His air and manner were tinctured with
the con&s;equence he derived from this per|&s;ua&s;ion;
and from having indulged him|&s;elf
in the cruel vanity of exten&s;ive con|que&s;t,
he was incapable of any la&s;ting or
&s;erious attachment. At the fir&s;t public
<PB N="48" REF="50">
meeting at any town he happened to be
quartered at, he elected &s;ome godde&s;s of
the day; with her he danced, he walked,
he rode, he coquetted; and by &s;tudied
looks, and tender &s;peeches, &s;oon per&s;uaded
the inexperienced girl that &s;he had &s;ecured
in her chains the hand&s;ome Thorold.
The delu&s;ion of the young woman her&s;elf,
and the envy of the cotemporary belles,
&s;ometimes la&s;ted till the removal of the
corps to another &s;tation: when he took a
cold farewel, and left her to &s;uffer all the
pain of di&s;appointed love and mortified
vanity: but he not unfrequently indulged
him&s;elf in witne&s;&s;ing the di&s;tre&s;s this wan|ton
folly inflicted; and after &s;ome days of
attention &s;o marked and unequivocal as to
give the lady rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e an ab&s;olute
declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion was certainly to
be expected, he &s;uddenly broke off the
acquaintance, pretended to forget their
intimacy, bowed to her when they met
with the air of a &s;tranger, and beginning
the &s;ame career with &s;ome other pretty girl
<PB N="49" REF="51">
of the place, he affected to treat with di&s;|dain
and wonder the reports he had him|&s;elf
rai&s;ed of his permanent attachment to
the fir&s;t lady, and laughed with her rival
at the melancholy moping looks, or glances
of angry di&s;appointment, of the de&s;erted
beauty, declaring him&s;elf amazed at her
having the vanity to &s;uppo&s;e him &s;erious,
becau&s;e he had &s;hewn her a few trifling at|tentions
which meant nothing.</P>
<P>This conduct of his &s;on had given Mr.
Thorold great unea&s;ine&s;s a few years be|fore,
but lately, as he had been in Ire|land,
and in very di&s;tant quarters, his fa|ther
had heard no more of it, and flattered
him&s;elf that now, at near thirty, this un|&s;ettled
temper and unju&s;tifiable levity would
end in his marrying and quitting the army.
But though a very fond father to all his
children, Mr. Thorold loved the Captain
le&s;s than the others; partly perhaps becau&s;e
he was &s;o early removed from him, and
rendered independent of his care, and
partly becau&s;e his temper and di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="50" REF="52">
re&s;embled not his own; while Mrs. Tho|rold
doated on her elde&s;t &s;on, who&s;e figure
and fortune gratified her vanity, and whom
&s;he thought no young woman could po&s;&s;i|bly
de&s;erve, unle&s;s &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at once
fortune, beauty, and fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, who was but ju&s;t
turned of one and twenty, and was de&s;igned
by his father for the church, was as mode&s;t
and una&s;&s;uming as his brother was arrogant
and pretending. He was a very good
&s;cholar, with a pa&s;&s;ion for poetry, and was
ju&s;t of the age to be in love with every
hand&s;ome woman he &s;aw; and without
having the courage to &s;peak to any of them
in pro&s;e, he celebrated his divinities in
ver&s;e, and &s;ighed forth his tender &s;enti|ments
in &s;onnets and elegies, which en|riched
the magazines, and now and then
the public prints, under the fictitious names
of Alphon&s;o or Ly&s;imachus.</P>
<P>Such were the two young men who were
now added to the tea table of Mrs. Tho|rold,
where all the family were a&s;&s;embled
<PB N="51" REF="53">
except Mr. Thorold him&s;elf, who always
breakfa&s;ted early and then went out to his
farm or among his pari&s;hioners.</P>
<P>Mrs. Thorold had told her &s;ons that a
young lady was vi&s;iting at the hou&s;e, who&s;e
hi&s;tory &s;he had given them in &s;hort hand,
de&s;cribing her as a dependant on the late
Mrs. Willoughby, whom her &s;on had very
&s;imply intended to marry at Alve&s;tone;
but the evening before the appointed wed|ding
day had broken off the match, from
prudential motives as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, and by
the advice of &s;ome of his friends who had
come down from London.</P>
<P>This was the idea Mrs. Thorold had her|&s;elf
conceived of the affair, and &s;he had no
means of being undeceived; for Mr. Tho|rold,
who knew that with her a command
was better than an argument, and who&s;e
authority was pretty firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, had
ordered her po&s;itively to a&s;k no que&s;tions
of his gue&s;t, and had peremptorily refu&s;ed
to an&s;wer tho&s;e &s;he put to him&s;elf. She
obeyed, but not without many murmurs;
<PB N="52" REF="54">
but knowing that Mr. Thorold would be
much di&s;obliged by her refu&s;al to entertain
Cele&s;tina with kindne&s;s, had put a re&s;traint
upon her&s;elf, and &s;hewed her hitherto much
civility, though not without many com|plaints
to Arabella, when they were alone,
of her father's ab&s;urdity in forcing people
into the family, and refu&s;ing even to &s;a|tisfy
her who and what they were, or what
claim they had to the kindne&s;s he exacted
for them.</P>
<P>From his mother's &s;ketch of their vi&s;itor
the evening before, Captain Thorold had
very little curio&s;ity to &s;ee her; and Mon|tague,
who&s;e heart was in one of it's mo&s;t
violent paroxi&s;ms of love for the fair
daughter of an attorney at Henly, with
whom he became acquainted about a fort|night
before, was occupied in compo&s;ing
an elegy on ab&s;ence, and thought he could
with indifference have beheld at that pe|riod
Helen her&s;elf: he had enquired of
his mother and &s;i&s;ter if their gue&s;t was
hand&s;ome: Mrs. Thorold an&s;wered&mdash;"No,
<PB N="53" REF="55">
not at all hand&s;ome in my opinion;" and
Arabella &s;aid&mdash;"Yes, &s;urely, Mama, &s;he
is rather pretty-i&s;h."</P>
<P>On her entering the room, however, both
the gentlemen were in&s;tantly of an opinion
very different from that of their mother and
their &s;i&s;ter: yet Cele&s;tina had not now that
dazzling complexion, or that animated coun|tenance,
which were once &s;o dangerous to
behold; &s;he was pale and languid; her
eyes had all their &s;oftne&s;s, but their lu&s;tre
was dimini&s;hed; and the enchanting &s;weet|ne&s;s
which u&s;ed to play about her mouth
was now &s;upplied by a melancholy &s;mile,
the effect of a faint effort to conceal the
angui&s;h of the heart.</P>
<P>Such as &s;he now appeared, however,
the Captain thought her very lovely; and
Montague almo&s;t in&s;tantly forgot the
nymph for whom he had been dying in
&s;ong all the morning, and &s;aw in the in|tere&s;ting
languor of Cele&s;tina&mdash;in her faded
cheek, and downca&s;t eyes, a &s;entimental
effect, which none of the fair creatures
<PB N="54" REF="56">
whom he had celebrated had ever &s;o emi|nently
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: but if &s;uch were his
&s;entiments before &s;he &s;poke, his admira|tion
aro&s;e to extravagance, when, after
breakfa&s;t, his &s;i&s;ter engaged her in a walk
in which the two gentlemen attended
them, and when he found that her mind
corre&s;ponded with the elegance of her
form; that &s;he was very well read, had a
ta&s;te for poetry, and under&s;tood Italian, of
which he was enthu&s;ia&s;tically fond. Cap|tain
Thorold, on whom the&s;e advantages
made le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion, was not quite plea&s;ed
during this walk with the unu&s;ual talkative|ne&s;s
of his brother, who generally &s;uffered
him to take the lead in conver&s;ation. He
now attempted to put by him two or three
times, and to relate anecdotes of people in
high life: of what General Wallace &s;aid
to him at Dublin Ca&s;tle upon his intro|duction
to the Duche&s;s of&mdash;, and of a
bon mot of Lady Mary Mar&s;den's at &s;up|per
one evening; but Cele&s;tina, who cared
nothing about the General, the Duche&s;s,
<PB N="55" REF="57">
or Lady Mary, let the conver&s;ation drop
without expre&s;&s;ing any plea&s;ure in it, and
again lent her attention to Montague, who
de&s;ired her to correct his accent while he
repeated&mdash;
<Q>O primavera, gioventu dell' anno&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Cele&s;tina mode&s;tly a&s;&s;ured him &s;he was
incapable of correcting him; but he be|&s;ought
her &s;o earne&s;tly to recite the lines
to him, that &s;he incon&s;iderately attempted
it, and in the mo&s;t enchanting accents be|gan&mdash;
<Q><L>O primavera gioventu dell' anno,</L>
<L>Bella madre di fiori</L>
<L>D'erbe novelle e di novelli amori:</L>
<L>Tu torni ben&mdash;ma teco</L>
<L>Non tornano i &s;ereni</L>
<L>E fortunati di delle mie gioje:</L></Q></P>
<P>The cruel remembrance that now pre&s;&s;ed
upon her heart made her voice tremble,
and gave it additional tenderne&s;s. She
tried to recover it; and going into a lower
tone, went on with&mdash;
<Q><PB N="56" REF="58">
<L>Tu torni ben&mdash;tu torni</L>
<L>Ma teco altro no torna</L>
<L>Che del perduto mio caro te&s;oro</L>
<L>Lo rimembranza mi&s;era e dolente.</L></Q></P>
<P>She could go no farther: the tears were
in her eyes; but &s;he tried to &s;mile, and to
&s;tifle the deep &s;igh that was ri&s;ing as &s;he
&s;aid&mdash;"I cannot go on, for really I re|member
no more."</P>
<P>The young man, fa&s;cinated by her
manner and her voice, now recollected&mdash;with
reluctance recollected, that the&s;e &s;e|ducing
tones were drawn forth by the
reality of tho&s;e &s;ufferings the poet de&s;cribed.
He looked at her in &s;ilence; and as he
marked the &s;ad and pen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ion that
remained on her countenance, that a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
which he had hardly time to
feel before, aro&s;e: he thought it impo&s;&s;ible
that Mr. Willoughby, having the power
to marry &s;uch a woman, and having once
formed the re&s;olution to do &s;o, &s;hould by
any per&s;ua&s;ions be diverted from his pur|po&s;e;
and he found that in the &s;ingle hour
<PB N="57" REF="59">
he had been with her, he admired her
enough to &s;acrifice every thing to her,
were it po&s;&s;ible that her regard could be
transferred to him. The improbability
that it ever could, &s;truck him forcibly,
and rendered him as &s;ilent as Cele&s;tina
her&s;elf; while the Captain, who had now
an opportunity of engro&s;&s;ing her attention,
rallied her on being &s;o much affected.
"I have no notion now," &s;aid he, "of
giving way to tho&s;e &s;ort of things. I love
gay and cheerful poetry. One is tired of
weeping at the fictitious mi&s;ery of fictitious
per&s;ons. I remember being &s;ome time
ago at a conver&s;ation in Dublin, where we
talked of the fa&s;hionable indifference which
every body has now for tragedy; and my
friend Hargrave, who has written, you
know, &s;everal things him&s;elf, was con|demning
it as the certain marks of the
vitiated ta&s;te and imbecility of the age:
I took up the argument on the other &s;ide;
and Lady Mary Mar&s;den thought as I
did. Indeed every body pre&s;ent allowed
<PB N="58" REF="60">
that it was quite ab&s;urd to go to a play,
which is intended to amu&s;e and entertain,
only to be made unea&s;y. She agreed with
me that people have concern enough in
real life, and need not go &s;eek it in way of
diver&s;ion."</P>
<P>"And did her Lady&s;hip," enquired
Montague Thorold, "give no other rea|&s;ons?"</P>
<P>"I think tho&s;e are very good rea&s;ons,"
replied the Captain.</P>
<P>"They might be &s;o," an&s;wered his
brother, "for a woman of fa&s;hion; but I
am per&s;uaded literary people and people of
ta&s;te think quite otherwi&s;e; and the an|cients,
who&s;e &s;uperior intellectual advan|tages
are not to be di&s;puted&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Oh prithee Montague," interrupted
the Captain, "don't run us down with
college cant. I am talking of the world
we live in; and the opinions of people
who lived two thou&s;and years ago are no
more in que&s;tion now than their dre&s;&s;es."
He then went on to retail other opinions
<PB N="59" REF="61">
of Lady Mary Mar&s;den, who was, as it
&s;eemed, the oracle of the hour in the &s;ociety
he had ju&s;t left. Cele&s;tina heard him
with apparent attention, but in truth without
knowing what he &s;aid; his brother,
rendered impatient by being interrupted
in his conver&s;ation with her, walked away;
and Arabella, who loved to hear de&s;crip|tions
of fine people, and to attend to fa|&s;hionable
conver&s;ation, kept up the dia|logue
till the end of their walk; when
Cele&s;tina went to her own room, Arabella
to her dre&s;&s;ing table, and the Captain,
finding his mother at work in the parlour,
thought he had a right to a&s;k her a few
que&s;tions about Cele&s;tina, in return for the
perpetual tone of interrogation &s;he had
kept up towards him ever &s;ince his arrival.</P>
<P>To Mrs. Thorold, the next gratification
to that of a&s;king que&s;tions was the plea&s;ure
of an&s;wering them: &s;he told her &s;on, there|fore,
not only all &s;he knew, but invented
an&s;wers on &s;ome points which &s;he only
gue&s;&s;ed at; and he under&s;tood, from her
<PB N="60" REF="62">
information, that Cele&s;tina had been very
partial to Willoughby; and &s;o &s;trong was
this partiality de&s;cribed, that he began to
doubt whether the propo&s;ed marriage had
not been a mere fine&s;&s;e to throw her off
her guard, and get her wholly into his
power; and whether his abrupt departure
had not been in con&s;equence of the &s;ucce&s;s
of this di&s;ingenuous but not unprecedented
method of proceeding.</P>
<P>Captain Thorold had &s;een Willoughby
frequently in his la&s;t vi&s;it at home, and
knew that he had every advantage which a
fine per&s;on and engaging manners could
give him; he was well acquainted with
the &s;ociety among which he lived, and had
heard &s;ome of them, but particularly Vava|&s;our,
de&s;cribed as being very gay and un|principled;
he had therefore little difficulty
in &s;uppo&s;ing that Willoughby re&s;embled
tho&s;e with whom he a&s;&s;ociated, and that
Cele&s;tina had been the victim of tho&s;e arts
which he &s;uppo&s;ed no man ever &s;crupled
to practice where the object was &s;o well
<PB N="61" REF="63">
worth the trouble; e&s;pecially one &s;o unpro|tected
as &s;he was, where no rigid father
was in the way to ob&s;truct their de&s;igns,
or Chamont-like brother to avenge the
wrong they might commit. Willoughby
now, however, &s;eemed quite out of the
que&s;tion; and he doubted not, but that
after a &s;hort interval given to &s;entimental
regret on the lo&s;s of a fir&s;t lover, &s;he would
li&s;ten to other vows, and encourage the
pa&s;&s;ion, which he thought it might be
very amu&s;ing to entertain her with, without
meaning however to offer him&s;elf to fill
&s;uch engagements as Willoughby had
broken. While he meditated on this pro|ject,
he could not help &s;miling at the culli|bility
of his father, who had thus, he
thought, taken into his protection, and
made the companion of his wife and daugh|ter,
the de&s;erted mi&s;tre&s;s of Willoughby.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE following morning Cathcart was
early at the hou&s;e of Mr. Thorold; and
Cele&s;tina, who ro&s;e now earlier than u&s;ual,
(to enjoy, if it could be called enjoyment,
a few hours, before &s;he was compelled to
hide her &s;orrows under the appearance of
attention to the family &s;he was with) met
him as he came from the &s;table; and in|&s;tead
of going into the hou&s;e, &s;he de&s;ired
he would walk with her towards the village.
"You have news for me," &s;aid &s;he;
"but if I may gue&s;s by your countenance
none that will relieve the weight I feel on
my heart."</P>
<P>"I am afraid not," replied he: "yet
indeed I have nothing to &s;ay that &s;hould
encrea&s;e it. Mr. Willoughby is well; he
<PB N="63" REF="65">
writes to me with more cheerfulne&s;s than
I expected, and a&s;&s;ures me that he has a
long letter for you, which he &s;hall &s;end
from Dover, where he &s;hall fini&s;h it."</P>
<P>"From Dover! He is then &s;et out on
this expedition. Ah! Cathcart! and ought
not &s;uch intelligence to add to my con|cern?"</P>
<P>"Not at all," replied Cathcart. "You
knew before that it was his intention; and
he tells me that on the event of this jour|ney
depends his ever &s;eeing Alve&s;tone
again. There is certainly a chance of it's
terminating favourably: at all events, if
this ab&s;ence is to end your &s;u&s;pen&s;e, you
&s;hould not only &s;ubmit to it, but endea|vour,
my dear Mi&s;s De Mornay, to keep
up both your health and &s;pirits."</P>
<P>"Alas! Cathcart," an&s;wered Cele&s;tina,
"there is nothing &s;o ea&s;y to the happy as
to give &s;uch advice, nothing &s;o difficult
to the wretched as to take it." She then
enquired into the other particulars con|tained
in Willoughby's letter; and after
<PB N="64" REF="66">
informing her&s;elf of the day when he expected
to be at Dover, and how long it might pro|bably
be before &s;he &s;hould receive the letter
he promi&s;ed her, &s;he turned the conver&s;ation
on Je&s;&s;y, whom &s;he expre&s;&s;ed an eager wi&s;h
to &s;ee: and &s;oon after Montague Thorold,
who impatiently watched her wherever &s;he
went, came to tell her that his mother
waited breakfa&s;t for her.</P>
<P>Cathcart, however, declined the invita|tion
to breakfa&s;t with them, and wi&s;hing
Cele&s;tina a good morning, and promi&s;ing
to be with her again in a day or two, he
went in &s;earch of Mr. Thorold, with whom
he &s;aid he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Many &s;ucceeding days pa&s;&s;ed without
any intere&s;ting event. The Captain took
every occa&s;ion to impre&s;s on Cele&s;tina an
idea of his con&s;equence, and the fa&s;hion|able
&s;tyle he lived in, to which &s;he gave
very little attention; while his brother,
whenever he left him an opportunity,
talked to her of books, or read to her
pa&s;&s;ages in favourite authors of which he
<PB N="65" REF="67">
heard her expre&s;s approbation: &s;he was
prevailed upon to &s;ing duets with Arabella;
and he was enchanted with her voice and
manner; &s;he &s;at down to draw the flowers
he gathered for her, while he hung over her
in raptures, or held her pallet, or read a bo|tanical
de&s;cription of the plants &s;he was paint|ing.
Captain Thorold rode out occa&s;ionally
to vi&s;it &s;uch of the neighbouring families as
he con&s;idered worth his attention; Arabella
was often of his party, and Mrs. Thorold
engaged in dome&s;tic concerns; and then
if Cele&s;tina could not e&s;cape to her own
room before Montague, who was always
upon the watch for her, could interrupt
her, he entreated her &s;o earne&s;tly to walk
with him, was &s;o obligingly &s;olicitous to
plea&s;e her, and &s;eemed &s;o mortified when
&s;he attempted to excu&s;e her&s;elf, that &s;he
could &s;eldom re&s;olve to refu&s;e him her
conver&s;ation, even when &s;he was mo&s;t
willing to be alone; and in the &s;imilarity
of their ta&s;tes and &s;tudies, and in the bro|therly
though &s;ilent &s;ympathy he appeared
<PB N="66" REF="68">
to feel for her &s;orrows, there was &s;ome|thing
&s;oothing to her &s;ick heart, which
rejected every idea of love but for Wil|loughby:
con&s;cious of which, and &s;uppo|&s;ing
that no man could con&s;ider her other|wi&s;e
than as de&s;tined to be his wife, or to
die unmarried, &s;he dreamed not that &s;he
was granting to young Thorold indulgence
fatal to his repo&s;e.</P>
<P>He was him&s;elf &s;oon aware of the dan|ger,
but he courted it; and though he
under&s;tood that the heart of Cele&s;tina was
engaged, he fancied, that without any
preten&s;ions to her love, he &s;hould be hap|pier
in being admitted to her friend&s;hip,
than the unrivalled affections of any other
woman could make him. He was too
artle&s;s, and too proud of his judgment, to
attempt to conceal this attachment from his
father, who, had Cele&s;tina been di&s;en|gaged,
would have preferred her, with
her &s;mall fortune and uncertain birth, to
the riche&s;t heire&s;s in the county: but know|ing
how &s;he was circum&s;tanced, he &s;aw
<PB N="67" REF="69">
his younger &s;on's encrea&s;ing partiality with
&s;ome concern, and took an opportunity,
when they were alone, to tell him the real
circum&s;tances of Cele&s;tina in regard to
Willoughby. "I can con&s;ider her," &s;aid
he, "no otherwi&s;e than his affianced wife.
They are parted by &s;ome cau&s;e of which I
am ignorant, but which will probably be
removed: in the mean time her youth and
beauty render her &s;ituation very danger|ous;
as from her being a foreigner, an or|phan,
and probably the natural daughter
of &s;ome per&s;on of high fa&s;hion in France,
who has taken care to de&s;troy all evidence
of her real family, &s;he is without relations
and without protection. Willoughby's fa|ther
was my old friend. When I was an
indigent curate he gave me a living, which,
though I have now, from being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of greater preferment, re&s;igned, I con&s;ider
as my fir&s;t &s;tep towards affluence. I am
therefore, bound to the family by grati|tude,
and to young Willoughby I am
bound by per&s;onal friend&s;hip and e&s;teem.
<PB N="68" REF="70">
Except &s;omething too much bordering on
ra&s;hne&s;s in his temper, I hardly know any
man &s;o faultle&s;s and &s;o worthy of regard.
He adores Mi&s;s De Mornay, and I am
convinced the happine&s;s of his life depends
on their union. Finding him torn from
her for the pre&s;ent, at the very moment
this union was to take place, I entered at
once into all the unea&s;ine&s;s that mu&s;t have
a&s;&s;ailed him, and I voluntarily offered my
protection to her, which he has &s;ince ac|knowledged
in a letter to me to be the
greate&s;t kindne&s;s he could receive. I have
promi&s;ed him to continue it as long as
&s;he has occa&s;ion for it or will accept it. Do
not, therefore, Montague, by any of your
excentricities, make this unea&s;y either to
her or to me. Don't fancy your&s;elf in
love with a young woman who is in fact
married. Any other kind of attention or
regard you &s;hew her will oblige me; but
let us have no making love, unle&s;s you
would drive her away and greatly di&s;oblige
me."</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71">
The young man readily promi&s;ed what
at the moment he was &s;incere in, that he
would not make love to Cele&s;tina; but he
did not promi&s;e not to feel the pa&s;&s;ion,
again&s;t which it was too late already to
guard him. Mr. Thorold however &s;up|po&s;ed,
that after this explanation there was
nothing to fear from the extreme &s;u&s;cepti|bility
of his younger &s;on; and for the elde&s;t,
he was too certain that he had not a heart
on which the charms and virtues of Cele&s;|tina,
or of any other beautiful and intere&s;t|ing
woman, could make any permanent
impre&s;&s;ion. He was ea&s;y therefore in a
&s;ituation which would have made many
narrow minded and &s;elfi&s;h parents very
much otherwi&s;e; and did not think the
pre&s;ence of his two &s;ons at home, a &s;ufficient
rea&s;on for withdrawing his generous kind|ne&s;s
from Cele&s;tina, to whom he was in|deed
affectionately attached for her own
&s;ake, to whom he loved to con&s;ider him&s;elf
as a guardian and protector.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72">
Mrs. Thorold, always bu&s;ied about the
intrigues and &s;chemes of the re&s;t of the
world, &s;aw not very minutely into tho&s;e of
her own family. As to her elde&s;t &s;on, &s;he
contemplated him as a &s;uperior being, who
had a right to marry the greate&s;t heire&s;s of
the kingdom. She heard him &s;peak &s;o
often of Lady Marys and Lady Carolines,
that &s;he concluded he might have any of
them whenever he plea&s;ed; and had &s;et
her imagination &s;o high as to his merits and
his fortune, that &s;he never &s;uppo&s;ed he
could think of bringing her any other than
a titled daughter in law. Cele&s;tina, whom
&s;he looked upon as a creature who&s;e title
to re&s;pect was very que&s;tionable, a de|pendant
from her birth, and now little
better than a dependant on her&s;elf, was
not a per&s;on likely to make any impre&s;&s;ion
on Captain Thorold; and the prejudice
operated on her per&s;on and her manners.
Mrs. Thorold could not &s;ee that &s;he was
hand&s;ome, or feel that &s;he was intere&s;ting;
and when the attention of young Thorold
<PB N="71" REF="73">
was very &s;trongly marked towards her,
his mother only ridiculed him, telling him
that he was never ea&s;y but when playing
the Philander, and that he cared not with
whom.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, interrupted the
progre&s;s of that &s;erious pa&s;&s;ion, which
Montague Thorold determined to indulge,
and of which Cele&s;tina was perfectly un|con&s;cious.
The more unre&s;erved &s;lattery
and free addre&s;s of the Captain &s;he knew
how to repre&s;s; and received all his ad|vances
with &s;o much coldne&s;s, that his
pride was piqued; and unu&s;ed to the
&s;lighte&s;t repul&s;e, he determined not to
brook it from one, who had, in his private
opinion, very little right to a&s;&s;ume dignity
or affect di&s;dain.</P>
<P>The manner he took up towards her in
con&s;equence of the&s;e opinions, was &s;o very
di&s;agreeable to her, that it forced her more
than ever into the &s;ociety of his brother;
before whom, though the Captain held
him very cheap as a boy and a pedant, he
<PB N="72" REF="74">
could not well addre&s;s to her &s;uch &s;peeches
as he had ventured to utter &s;everal times
when he &s;eized an opportunity of &s;peaking
to her alone, or unheard by the re&s;t of the
family. Whenever, therefore, &s;he was
compelled to be below, &s;he contrived to
have Montague Thorold &s;it next to her, to
accept his arm as they walked, and to ad|dre&s;s
her di&s;cour&s;e to him: and flattered by
this evident preference, he let no occa&s;ion
pa&s;s of proving how happy it made him.</P>
<P>So pa&s;&s;ed heavily for Cele&s;tina, the days
that intervened between that when &s;he la&s;t
&s;aw Cathcart, and that on which &s;he ex|pected
Willoughby's letter from Dover.
The day arrived at length; and Cele&s;tina,
who happened to be &s;itting with Arabella
and her brothers when the letters were
brought, could hardly &s;upport her&s;elf
while the Captain took them from the &s;er|vant,
and reading the direction of each,
threw them acro&s;s the table, now one to
his &s;i&s;ter, now one to his brother, and bade
Montague carry a third to his father.
<PB N="73" REF="75">
There was none for Cele&s;tina, though
Cathcart had told her it would be directed
to her at the hou&s;e of Mr. Thorold. Of
this bitter di&s;appointment, however, &s;he
&s;poke not, but tried to conceal the change
it occa&s;ioned in her countenance, and
ha&s;tened, as &s;oon as &s;he could, to weep
alone, over the &s;ad idea that Willoughby's
dimini&s;hed, perhaps annihilated love, had
allowed him to torture her with &s;u&s;pen&s;e
which he might &s;o ea&s;ily have avoided by
punctuality.</P>
<P>Another almo&s;t &s;leeple&s;s night was the
con&s;equence of this delay: but though
without re&s;t in the night, Cele&s;tina ro&s;e as
&s;oon as day appeared. At no other time
but early in the morning &s;he had now any
chance of being alone either in the garden
or the neighbouring fields, and the air
&s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to her overburthened
&s;pirits. In the fields, &s;he &s;eemed to breathe
more freely, and her heart, which often
felt as if it would bur&s;t, was relieved while
<PB N="74" REF="76">
&s;he was allowed to weep unmarked and un|interrupted.</P>
<P>A narrow road, &s;haded by thick rows
of branching elms, led towards the village,
which was that way almo&s;t a mile from
the hou&s;e of Mr. Thorold, who did not
inhabit the par&s;onage but an hou&s;e he had
built on a farm of his own. Cele&s;tina, to
avoid being &s;een from the windows of the
hou&s;e, which commanded the garden and
the meadows near it, took her way down
this lane. Her thoughts ran over the
&s;trange events of the preceding years, in
which &s;he had experienced &s;o much an|gui&s;h,
angui&s;h embittered by the tran&s;ient
promi&s;e of &s;upreme happine&s;s. As &s;he
reviewed her whole life, it &s;eemed to have
been productive only of regret. "Why,"
cried &s;he, "was I ever born? Alas! my
exi&s;tence was the occa&s;ion of mi&s;ery to
tho&s;e who gave it me! Why did deare&s;t
Mrs. Willoughby take me from a confine|ment
where I was dead to the world, and
where perhaps neglect and hard&s;hip might
<PB N="75" REF="77">
long &s;ince have relea&s;ed me? What will
now become of me? If Willoughby for|gets
me, how &s;hall I find courage to drag
about a wretched being? u&s;eful to no|body,
for whom nobody is intere&s;ted, and
which &s;eems marked by heaven for cala|mity!"</P>
<P>The&s;e melancholy reflections led her on,
till a turn out of the road brought her to
the &s;tyle of the church yard. She leant
pen&s;ively over it, and read the ru&s;tic in|&s;criptions
on the tomb &s;tones. One was
that of a young woman of nineteen: it was
her own age; and Cele&s;tina felt an emo|tion
of envy towards the village girl, who&s;e
early death the rural poet lamented in the
in&s;cription. "Merciful heaven!" cried
&s;he, "is early death ever really to be la|mented?
and &s;hould I not be happier to
die now than to live; as perhaps I &s;hall to
be forgotten?" In&s;en&s;ibly this idea took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her fancy; and with her pen|cil
&s;he wrote the following lines in her
pocket book, not without &s;ome recollection
<PB N="76" REF="78">
of Edwards's thirty &s;eventh and forty fourth
&s;onnets:</P>
<Q><LG>

<L>Oh thou! who &s;leepe&s;t where hazle bands entwine,</L>
<L>The vernal gra&s;s, with paler violets dre&s;t,</L>

<L>And mine, thy calm and enviable re&s;t.</L>
<L>For never more, by human ills oppre&s;t,</L>
<L>Shall thy &s;oft &s;pirit fruitle&s;sly repine:</L>
<L>Thou can&s;t not now thy fonde&s;t hope re&s;ign</L>

<L>Light lies the turf upon thy virgin brea&s;t;</L>
<L>And lingering here, to love and &s;orrow true,</L>
<L>The youth, who once thy &s;imple heart po&s;&s;e&s;s'd,</L>

<L>While &s;till for him, &s;hall faithful Memory &s;ave,</L>
<L>Thy form and virtues from the &s;ilent grave!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who had a natural turn to
poetry, had very rarely indulged it; but
&s;ince &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many hours with
Willoughby, his pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s for it,
and his de&s;ire that &s;he &s;hould not neglect
the talent &s;he had received from nature,
had turned her thoughts to it's cultiva|tion;
and now almo&s;t the fir&s;t u&s;e &s;he
<PB N="77" REF="79">
made of it was to lament that &s;he lived,
&s;ince none of her acquirements were to
plea&s;e him, for whom alone &s;he wi&s;hed to
po&s;&s;e&s;s either life or talents.</P>
<P>She had fini&s;hed her &s;onnet, and read it
over aloud: &s;he changed a word or two,
again read it, and was putting it into her
pocket book, when &s;he was &s;tartled by the
&s;ight of Montague Thorold, who appeared
behind her, though &s;he had not heard
him approach. "Do not," he cried, "be
offended, deare&s;t Mi&s;s De Mornay, if I
thus break in upon your &s;olitude; and do
not," continued he, taking her hand, in
which &s;he &s;till held the pocket book&mdash;"do
not puni&s;h me by putting away what
I have &s;o earne&s;t a de&s;ire to hear."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, half angry, replied&mdash;"I have
nothing, Sir, worth your hearing."</P>
<P>"I have offended you," &s;aid he, in the
mo&s;t re&s;pectful tone&mdash;"I &s;ee you are
offended. If you knew my heart, you
would know how much better I could bear
<PB N="78" REF="80">
any misfortune than your contempt and
anger."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who&s;e &s;light di&s;plea&s;ure was
already at an end, an&s;wered with a &s;mile,
that he certainly de&s;erved neither: "but
come," continued &s;he, "you were &s;ent I
dare &s;ay to call me to breakfa&s;t and we are
loitering here."</P>
<P>"I was not &s;ent," an&s;wered he. "I be|lieve
it is yet earlier than you imagine it to
be. You are not then offended at my in|terrupting
you?"</P>
<P>"Oh no! think of it no more," &s;aid
Cele&s;tina, wi&s;hing to change the di&s;cour&s;e.
"Is it not a delicious morning?"</P>
<P>He an&s;wered not her que&s;tion; but fix|ing
his eyes on her's, &s;aid&mdash;"See how
&s;oon a &s;econd tre&s;pa&s;s is attempted when
the fir&s;t is &s;o graciou&s;ly forgiven. <HI>May</HI> I
a&s;k, as the mo&s;t ine&s;timable favour, to
hear once more the lines you were reciting?"</P>
<P>"Once more!" repeated Cele&s;tina.
"Have you heard them once already
then?"</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="81">
"I will &s;ay I have <HI>not,</HI> if my acknow|ledging
that I have will di&s;plea&s;e you."</P>
<P>"I do not think," &s;aid Cele&s;tina care|le&s;sly,
"that will mend your ca&s;e much:
but however the lines were not worth your
hearing, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Every thing you even repeat from
another," cried he, eagerly interrupting
her, "is worth hearing: how much more
worth hearing, when that fa&s;cinating voice
is employed in expre&s;&s;ing the &s;entiments of
that elegant and lovely mind. Oh! Ce|le&s;tina!&mdash;But
forgive me, Madam; it is
pre&s;umption indeed in me to addre&s;s you
&s;o freely; yet Cele&s;tina is the only name
in the world that &s;eems to me fit for you.
The common terms of formal civility are
unworthy of you. Let me then call you
Cele&s;tina, not in familiarity, but in vene|ration,
in adoration; and entreat you, im|plore
you to oblige me."</P>
<P>Di&s;concerted at his vehemence of man|ner
and extravagance of expre&s;&s;ion, Cele&s;|tina
now thought it better to put an end to
<PB N="80" REF="82">
&s;uch very warm applications, by &s;hewing
him the little value in her eyes of the fa|vour
he &s;olicited. She gave him the paper,
therefore, &s;aying coldly&mdash;"You are anxi|ous
for a very trifling matter; and as you
have already heard the lines, it is hardly
worth the time you mu&s;t give, ha&s;tily
written as they are, and with interlineations
and era&s;ures, to make them out."</P>
<P>"Give me then time to do it," cried he,
as he ki&s;&s;ed the paper and put it in his
bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, more di&s;concerted by his
manner than before, &s;aid yet more gravely,
"I beg I may have them again imme|diately."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall indeed," replied Thorold;
"but I mu&s;t fir&s;t read them."</P>
<P>"Read them then now," replied &s;he.</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible," cried he, "for here
is Arabella and my brother coming to meet
us; and it is the fir&s;t time that being with
you, I felt their interruption as a favour."</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">
During this dialogue Cele&s;tina had
walked rather quickly towards the hou&s;e,
&s;o that they were by this time within &s;ight
of the garden gate, from whence Captain
and Mi&s;s Thorold advanced &s;lowly towards
them. Montague, as if con&s;cious of the
impropriety of what had pa&s;&s;ed, now af|fected
to be talking of indifferent matters;
and Cele&s;tina, ruffled by his wild enthu&s;ia&s;m,
and eagerly anticipating the letter which
&s;he hoped that day would bring her from
Willoughby, felt her&s;elf made unea&s;y by
the &s;teady and enquiring eyes of the Cap|tain,
who had acquired a very rude habit
of &s;taring people out of countenance. She
was compelled however to endure it, not
only while breakfa&s;t la&s;ted, but afterwards
when Arabella engaged her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in
painting a trimming which was to compo&s;e
the ornament of a gala dre&s;s for the balls at
Tunbridge, whither &s;he was going in June

</LETTER>
<P>This letter was if po&s;&s;ible more un&s;atis|factory
than the la&s;t. No rea&s;on was yet
given for his having left her, no certainty
held out of his return; but all, if not hope|le&s;s,
was &s;o comfortle&s;s, &s;o ob&s;cure, that
her re&s;olution to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of
all that had happened, again failed. She
feared even to attempt putting a&s;ide the
fearful veil that was drawn between them.
He was now in another country, from
whence his return &s;eemed uncertain; and
&s;he &s;eemed the mo&s;t de&s;olate and forlorn
being that exi&s;ted on that which he had
left. Her heart &s;unk within her in re|membering
<PB N="86" REF="88">
that &s;he might never &s;ee him
more; that he hardly &s;eemed to wi&s;h &s;he
&s;hould. Again &s;he read his letter over.
He was &s;leeple&s;s, re&s;tle&s;s, unhappy; and
for his &s;ufferings &s;he wept more than for
her own.</P>
<P>The plan he mentioned of her re&s;iding
with the Cathcarts, was the only one to
which, &s;ince their &s;eparation, &s;he had
looked forward with any degree of &s;atis|faction.
But that there was yet little pro|bability
of executing: for old Winnington
was in even better health than he had been
for &s;ome years; and though the tender a&s;&s;i|duity
of Je&s;&s;y had won much even on his
in&s;en&s;ible heart, he &s;uffered her to have no
authority; and often being &s;eized with fits
of jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion that &s;he went to
meet and a&s;&s;i&s;t her father, he would in&s;i&s;t
upon her not quitting him a moment; &s;o
that &s;he had &s;ometimes for many days to|gether
no opportunity of &s;eeing her hu&s;|band,
and had never once, &s;ince her &s;epa|ration
from Cele&s;tina, been able to reach
<PB N="87" REF="89">
her pre&s;ent abode. Cele&s;tina had not been
an hour alone, before Montague Thorold
tapped at her door. She dried her eyes,
and pulling her hat over them, opened it
to him.</P>
<P>"Will you not walk," &s;aid he, apolo|gizing
however for his intru&s;ion. "I am|afraid
I di&s;turb you: but the morning is &s;o
beautiful; and we are all going to &s;ee a
pond fi&s;hed, with two friends of my bro|ther's
from Exeter, who are ju&s;t come in."</P>
<P>"I cannot indeed," an&s;wered Cele&s;tina.
"Pray excu&s;e me."</P>
<P>"I would not pre&s;s you for the world,"
&s;aid he, "to do any thing that is di&s;agree|ble
to you. But the air will be &s;urely u&s;e|ful
to you. You&mdash;have been weeping,
Mi&s;s De Mornay! and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"If I have," replied &s;he, interrupting
him, "you may be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that I
have rea&s;on enough for my tears, and
would wi&s;h to enjoy them alone."</P>
<P>"Precious tears!" cried he with a deep
<PB N="88" REF="90">
&s;igh. "The letter was from the fortunate
Willoughby!"</P>
<P>"Fortunate do you call him?" But
Cele&s;tina, as if offended that any tongue
but her's &s;hould name him, &s;topped, and
turning from the door, went into her own
room.</P>
<P>At this moment Arabella ran up &s;tairs to
fetch her cloak and gloves, and &s;eeing her
brother Montague at the door of Cele&s;tina's
room, cried, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed him&mdash;"Hey
day! are you in waiting as Page or Gen|tleman
U&s;her?"</P>
<P>"As neither," an&s;wered he in &s;ome
confu&s;ion. "I was merely a&s;king if Mi&s;s
De Mornay would walk with us."</P>
<P>"Oh! I dare &s;ay not," replied his &s;i&s;ter,
&s;miling maliciou&s;ly as &s;he looked over her
&s;houlder at him&mdash;"I dare &s;ay not. Mon|tague,
what are you in now? Are you
Romeo&mdash;"Oh! that I were a glove upon
"that hand, that I might touch that cheek!"
or are you Ca&s;talio?&mdash;"Sweets planted by
"the hand of heaven grow here." You al|ways
<PB N="89" REF="91">
make love I know by book. What!
&s;hall I call Edmund to take the part of
Polydore? I think you will make it out
among you."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who had heard this &s;peech,
though it was not meant that &s;he &s;hould,
was equally amazed and hurt at it. It had
however a very different effect from what
the &s;peaker intended; who having no wi&s;h
that Cele&s;tina &s;hould join them, becau&s;e
&s;he de&s;ired to monopolize the conver&s;ation
of the two &s;trangers, thought, by rallying
her brother, to break off his entreaty.
Montague, mild as he was, was piqued
extremely, and would re&s;entingly have
an&s;wered, if his &s;i&s;ter had not immediately
di&s;appeared, and if Cele&s;tina had not at
the &s;ame moment opened her door and
&s;aid&mdash;"You compel me, Mr. Montague,
to walk whether I will or no."</P>
<P>"Pray forgive me," &s;aid he, interrupt|ing
her. "I would purcha&s;e no plea&s;ure
at your expence."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">
Arabella now returning down &s;tairs, was
&s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her preparing to go. "I
thought you declined walking Ma'am,"
&s;aid &s;he formally. Cele&s;tina made an
effort to conquer the re&s;entment &s;he ju&s;tly
felt, and replied coldly that the morning
was &s;o plea&s;ant &s;he thought it would be a
pity to lo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Her apprehen&s;ions indeed were, that had
&s;he remained at home, Montague, who
had per&s;ecuted her the whole day, would
have remained al&s;o; and the hint his &s;i&s;ter
had given of the rivalry of the brothers
had at once &s;hocked and amazed her. Af|ter
a moment, however, &s;he began to fancy
that her &s;peech had more malice than mean|ing
in it: but the unea&s;ine&s;s of her &s;itua|tion,
and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;oon removing
from it, recurred to her more forcibly than
ever. She endeavoured, as &s;he went down
&s;tairs, to regain her compo&s;ure, apprehen|&s;ive
that the &s;trangers, if not the family,
might remark her emotion. But &s;he &s;oon
found that there was little to be appre|hended
<PB N="91" REF="93">
from either the one or the other:
Captain Thorold was walking arm in arm
before the hou&s;e with Captain Mu&s;grave,
the elder of the two gentlemen, and Mi&s;s
Thorold wholly monopolized the attention
of Mr. Betten&s;on, a very young man, heir
to a con&s;iderable fortune, who had a few
months before, on his leaving Eton, pur|cha&s;ed
a Cornetcy of hor&s;e, very much
again&s;t the inclinations of his father, who&s;e
only &s;on he was. He could indeed give
no other rea&s;on for his preference to a mi|litary
life, but that he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a
very idle life, and that he &s;hould look un|commonly
well in the uniform of the corps.</P>
<P>This however did not &s;ucceed to his
wi&s;hes, though he was very far from being
aware how entirely they had failed. He
had a very round back, very narrow &s;houl|ders,
a long forlorn face, to which the
feathered helmet gave neither grace nor
&s;pirit; and the defects of his mean and ill
formed figure were rendered more apparent
by that dre&s;s, which is an advantage to a
<PB N="92" REF="94">
well made and graceful man. He had twice
danced with Belle Thorold at the provin|cial
a&s;&s;emblies towards the end of winter,
and now, after having been in town for a
few weeks, prevailed on Captain Mu&s;grave
to introduce him to a family, where he
&s;uppo&s;ed he might find a <HI>mon&s;trous good
lounge</HI> for the re&s;t of the time he was to be
quartered in the neighbourhood. Cele&s;tina
no &s;ooner &s;aw Mi&s;s Thorold's behaviour to
this young man than &s;he accounted at once
for the di&s;&s;atisfaction &s;he had &s;hewn at her
joining the party; for &s;he endeavoured by
more than her u&s;ual vivacity to monopolize
all his attention; &s;he watched with unea&s;y
curio&s;ity every glance of his eye towards
Cele&s;tina; and &s;eeing that he hardly no|ticed
her being among them, and was not
&s;truck with that beauty which the Captain
and Montague had &s;o admired, &s;he pre|&s;ently
rea&s;&s;umed her u&s;ual confidence in
her own attractions, and thought only of
&s;ecuring the advantage &s;he had gained.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95">
Cele&s;tina, not having the remote&s;t wi&s;h
to interfere with her conque&s;ts, and being
di&s;plea&s;ed and offended at the curious looks
and whi&s;pers of the two other military men,
who continued to &s;aunter on before, was again
under the nece&s;&s;ity of li&s;tening to Monta|gue,
who never failed &s;eizing every op|portunity
obliquely to hint to her the en|crea&s;ing
admiration with which &s;he had in|&s;pired
him, though he at the &s;ame time
gave her to under&s;tand that he knew he had
nothing to expect but her pity and her
friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>This was however repeated till it be|came
very unea&s;y to her; and the more &s;o,
becau&s;e &s;o re&s;pectful was his addre&s;s that
&s;he &s;eldom knew how to &s;hew re&s;entment,
and &s;o &s;incere appeared his repentance,
when &s;he expre&s;&s;ed any, that &s;he could
not long retain it.</P>
<P>As they now followed the re&s;t of the
party, Cele&s;tina took occa&s;ion to a&s;k
Montague for the paper &s;he had been
teized out of in the morning. "I know
<PB N="94" REF="96">
not," &s;aid &s;he, on his eva&s;ive an&s;wer,
"whether my folly in giving it, or your
ab&s;urdity in keeping it, be the greater.
Pray re&s;tore it, and let us think no more
of &s;uch trifling&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I will give you," an&s;wered he, "a
copy of it, which I have already began to
write; but for the original&mdash;" He
&s;topped, and &s;uddenly &s;eizing her hand,
pre&s;&s;ed it to his brea&s;t; where, under his
wai&s;tcoat, the paper was enfolded. "There,"
&s;aid he&mdash;"there is your paper. I have
put it next my heart, and never &s;hall it be
di&s;placed unle&s;s you will give me &s;ome yet
dearer memorial to remain there."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina withdrew her hand in confu|&s;ion;
and feeling more than ever the nece&s;|&s;ity
of putting an end to &s;uch &s;ort of con|duct,
&s;he &s;aid, with evident di&s;plea&s;ure
and concern&mdash;"You behave, Mr. Mon|tague,
not only improperly in this fooli&s;h
matter, but cruelly and in&s;ultingly towards
me, who have, you know, at this time no
proper home to receive me; but &s;ince you
thus per&s;ecute me with conver&s;ation, from
<PB N="95" REF="97">
which, though I cannot e&s;cape, I can only
hear with concern and re&s;entment, I mu&s;t
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible find another temporary
abode, and acknowledging all your father's
kindne&s;s, quit his hou&s;e."</P>
<P>The young man, who, amid&s;t his wild
enthu&s;ia&s;m, wanted neither &s;en&s;e nor gene|ro&s;ity,
was now &s;hocked at her &s;uppo&s;ing
he meant to in&s;ult her; and terrified at the
idea of her being driven to inconvenience
by leaving his father's hou&s;e&mdash;"I am al|ways
offending," &s;aid he, in a voice ex|pre&s;&s;ive
of the concern he felt, "and I am
afraid often wrong; but pardon me once
more, Mi&s;s De Mornay, pardon and pity
me, and I will not again tre&s;pa&s;s on your
patience with di&s;cour&s;e which perhaps you
ought not to hear; though &s;urely the happy
Willoughby him&s;elf would not be alarmed
at the hopele&s;s admiration of a man&mdash;who
knows, that he can never pretend to any
other than di&s;tant and humble adoration:
<Q><L>It were all one</L>
<L>That I &s;hould love a bright particular &s;tar.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">
He was going on, when Captain Tho|rold,
who had imperceptibly &s;lackened his
pace, caught the&s;e words, which were
&s;poken in a theatrical tone, and &s;topping
with his friend, Cele&s;tina and Montague
were immediately clo&s;e to them. "So,
Montague," &s;aid he, "at the old game.
Mi&s;s De Mornay, I barr all quotations.
'Tis not fair for Montague to avail him&s;elf
at once of his own talents and tho&s;e of all
the poets and &s;onnetteers he is acquainted
with."</P>
<P>"He will avail him&s;elf of neither, Sir,"
an&s;wered Cele&s;tina, "and I a&s;&s;ure you I
wi&s;h our conver&s;ation to become more ge|neral."</P>
<P>"There, Montague," cried the Cap|tain,
"you &s;ee you have tired Mi&s;s De
Mornay in your tete a tete; let us &s;ee if
Mu&s;grave and I cannot more &s;ucce&s;sfully
entertain her.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who did not promi&s;e her&s;elf
much advantage from the change, &s;ince
Captain Thorold's addre&s;s to her was often
<PB N="97" REF="99">
as warm as his brother's, but never &s;o
re&s;pectful, now ha&s;tened forward to join
Mi&s;s Thorold; but &s;he received no no|tice
either from her or her little military
beau: they were by this time however
near the end of their walk, and were met
by the family of Mr. Cranfield, to whom
the pond belonged which they were to
&s;ee fi&s;hed. The children, &s;everal fine
boys, now at home for their Ea&s;ter holy|days,
were a&s;&s;embled round it eager and
delighted. Montague, who was a great
favourite in the neighbourhood, was en|gaged
in talking with their mother and
with them; while their father, having
civilly noticed the whole party, entered
into conver&s;ation with the gentlemen;
and Mi&s;s Thorold and Mr. Betten&s;on &s;till
continuing to entertain each other, regard|le&s;s
of every body el&s;e, Cele&s;tina, who
was fatigued by her walk, and &s;till more
by the unea&s;ine&s;s of her reflections, &s;at
down under one of the trees which over|&s;hadowed
the pond; and her thoughts,
<PB N="98" REF="100">
which had long been di&s;tracted by inter|ruptions,
were immediately with Wil|loughby.
So intirely indeed was &s;he
for &s;ome moments ab&s;orbed in reflection,
that though &s;he &s;aw objects moving be|fore
her, and heard the &s;houts of the
boys, the mixed voices of the party
who &s;urrounded the water, and the &s;er|vants
who were drawing the nets, &s;he
totally forgot where &s;he was, and was
in&s;en&s;ible even of that want of common
politene&s;s which the whole party evinced
in &s;o entirely neglecting her. Montague,
however, could not long be guilty of it;
but di&s;engaging him&s;elf from Mrs. Cran|field,
who was one of tho&s;e ince&s;&s;ant
talkers from whom it is difficult to e&s;cape,
he came towards her; and fearful of re|newing
the di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he had &s;o forcibly
expre&s;&s;ed a quarter of an hour before, he
only named his fears that &s;he might
receive injury by fitting on the gra&s;s; to
which, as &s;he gave a cold and re|luctant
an&s;wer, he added a deep &s;igh,
<PB N="99" REF="101">
and then leaning again&s;t the tree under
which &s;he &s;at, he fell into a reverie as
deep as her own. From this mournful
&s;ilence &s;he was rou&s;ed by the &s;udden
appearance of an hor&s;eman, who rode
very fa&s;t near her, and who, on lifting
up her eyes, &s;he immediately di&s;covered to
be Vava&s;our.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and painful &s;en&s;ations aro&s;e on
the &s;ight of him; though the fir&s;t idea
that occurred was, that he came from
Willoughby. He pa&s;&s;ed her, however,
without &s;eeing her, and reaching the party
who were beyond her, he gave his hor&s;e to
his &s;ervant and joined them.</P>
<P>By the manner in which Vava&s;our ad|dre&s;&s;ed
Mr. Cranfield, and the manner in
which he was received by him, Cele&s;tina
immediately under&s;tood that he was an
expected gue&s;t. "He comes not to me,"
&s;aid &s;he. "Willoughby &s;ends no friend
to me! He is far, far off! and perhaps
his mo&s;t intimate acquaintance may now
&s;hun as a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly as he once &s;ought me."
<PB N="100" REF="102">
Then the fears &s;he had. once entertained
that &s;ome difference of opinion had occa|&s;ioned
a quarrel between him and Wil|loughby
recurred to her; and remember|ing
how different her &s;ituation had been
when he abruptly left Alve&s;tone, and how
very cruel was the change, &s;he grew di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
at the thoughts of meeting Vava|&s;our,
and meeting him before &s;o many
&s;trangers: &s;he again repented having
walked out, and her &s;oul &s;ickened at the
many uncomfortable occurrences to which
&s;he was continually expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In a few moments, Vava&s;our, who
&s;eemed to have lo&s;t none of his viva|city,
had been introduced to the Captain
and Mi&s;s Thorold, but he hardly made
his bow to them before he &s;aid to the
latter&mdash;"Mi&s;s De Mornay is with you &s;till,
Madam; is &s;he not?"</P>
<P>"With us?" replied Arabella. "Oh!
yes&mdash;Mi&s;s De Mornay is with us."</P>
<P>"She is well I hope?" enquired Vava|&s;our
eagerly.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="103">
"You may &s;atisfy your&s;elf by per&s;onal
enquiry,". &s;aid Mrs. Cranfield, "for there
is the young lady. She and Mr. Montague
really form a very picture&s;que appear|ance."</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, now turning his eyes on the
oppo&s;ite &s;ide, &s;aw Cele&s;tina, and in&s;tantly
advanced towards her with an eagerne&s;s
of manner which he took no pains to
check. She aro&s;e on his approach; and
hardly knowing how to receive him, &s;o
various and painful were her &s;en&s;ations,
&s;he held out her hand to him, then with|drew
it; and when he &s;poke to her with
all that good humour with which he u&s;ed
to approach her in her happier days, it
brought tho&s;e days back to her mind &s;o
forcibly, that &s;he could not conquer her
emotion, and bur&s;t into tears. Vava&s;our
was immediately checked; and &s;aid, with
evident concern&mdash;"My dear Mi&s;s De
Mornay, the plea&s;ure I felt in again &s;eeing
you conquered for a moment the recollec|tion
<PB N="102" REF="104">
of what has happened &s;ince we parted
la&s;t."</P>
<P>"It is a &s;ubject," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, trying
to recover her&s;elf, "on which I cannot
now talk: yet&mdash;" and &s;he moved a few
&s;teps forward to e&s;cape the earne&s;t looks of
Montague Thorold, which were fixed on
her face&mdash;"yet I cannot help a&s;king if
you have &s;een your friend &s;ince&mdash;"</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, walking on with her to avoid
the ob&s;ervation of the company, &s;aid&mdash;"Seen
him? to be &s;ure I have: I was con|tinually
with him in London all the while
he remained there."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina now proceeded in &s;ilence, &s;truck
with the idea that Willoughby had cer|tainly
acquainted his friend during that
time with the rea&s;on of their abrupt &s;epa|ration.
She had not, however, courage to
a&s;k him; but having wiped away the tears
which a moment before filled her eyes, &s;he
turned them upon him with a look &s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ive
of what pa&s;&s;ed in her heart, that
Vava&s;our, who could not mi&s;under&s;tand
<PB N="103" REF="105">
her, an&s;wered, as if &s;he had &s;poken to
him&mdash;"I do not <HI>certainly</HI> know the cau&s;e
of George's very &s;udden and extraordinary
change of mea&s;ures; but I have rea&s;on to
believe the Ca&s;tlenorths, though how I
cannot tell, were the occa&s;ion of it. Though
I was with him every day, I had very
little conver&s;ation with him, for he always
affected to be, or really was hurried if I &s;aw
him in the cour&s;e of the day; or, if towards
night, complaining of fatigue, and taking
laudanum, without which he &s;aid he could
not &s;leep. When he informed me of his
having left you at Alve&s;tone without ac|counting
for his ab&s;ence, he &s;aw my a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
and put an end at once to my
enquiries by &s;aying&mdash;"Vava&s;our, you know
my unbounded confidence in you, and
that any thing that related merely to my|&s;elf
would be known to you as the fir&s;t
friend of my heart; but do not a&s;k me
any que&s;tions now: I cannot an&s;wer
them truly, and therefore I will not be
liable to them: even your friend&s;hip
<PB N="104" REF="106">
and zeal can here do me no good."
This," continued Vava&s;our, "precluded
all enquiry; nor could I obtain any farther
&s;atisfaction, when a few days afterwards,
the very day indeed before he left Lon|don,
he de&s;ired I would meet him at the
chambers of Edwards, our mutual attorney,
where, in &s;pite of my re&s;i&s;tance, he paid me
the money which you know I lent him, with
the intere&s;t, with as much regularity as if I
had fixed that time for payment; and when
I very warmly remon&s;trated on the un|friendly
appearance this had, be&s;ought
him to oblige me by keeping the money,
and expre&s;&s;ed &s;omething like re&s;entment
at his conduct, he &s;aid, with a &s;ort of af|fected
calmne&s;s, and almo&s;t &s;ternly&mdash;"Va|va&s;our,
I am going abroad. I may die,
and I will not leave any thing between
us to be &s;ettled by Lady Molyneux,
who would be my heir at law; and do
not you," added he, "my good friend,
get a habit of throwing your four or five
thou&s;ands about you, but learn to value
<PB N="105" REF="107">
money a little more&mdash;" And friends a
little le&s;s, &s;aid I, interrupting him in my
quick way; for that, Willoughby, is the
next le&s;&s;on I expect to hear from you.
This money, however, Edwards &s;hall keep
till you are quite &s;ure you do not want it.
"I am already &s;ure of it," &s;aid he, "and
do beg, my dear Vava&s;our, that you will
immediately pay it into the hands of the
per&s;on from whom you borrowed it for
my u&s;e, as the only way in which it can
now contribute to my &s;atisfaction." Wil|loughby
then left me with the attorney,
of whom I enquired if he could gue&s;s
where he got the money; Edwards a&s;|&s;ured
me he could not, as he knew no|thing
more of the affair than that he was
that day to pay it at his chambers to me."</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance &s;eemed, in the mind
of Cele&s;tina, to confirm the notion Vava|&s;our
had &s;tarted, that the Ca&s;tlenorths were
&s;omehow or other the cau&s;e of Willough|by's
having left her; yet, as they could
have no power over him from affection or
<PB N="106" REF="108">
friend&s;hip, their influence, if indeed they
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any, mu&s;t ari&s;e from their riches;
and what was &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition but to
&s;uppo&s;e him a &s;udden convert to merce|nary
politics, from being generous and
di&s;intere&s;ted even to exce&s;s, if &s;uch noble
qualities could ever lean towards error.
The mind of Cele&s;tina no &s;ooner harboured
&s;uch an idea than her heart rejected it;
but all &s;he heard from Vava&s;our tended
only to augment her perplexity and her
&s;orrow, which, as he perfectly under|&s;tood,
&s;he &s;aw that he would if he could
have removed.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t afraid of a&s;king any que&s;tion,
where it was ea&s;y to &s;ee he could not an|&s;wer
without wounding her, &s;he acquired,
after a few moments, re&s;olution to &s;ay&mdash;"Where,
Sir, did you at la&s;t part from
him? What did he then &s;ay to you?"</P>
<P>"I took leave of him at the hotel where
he lodged, and where I had been with him
for about an hour before the chai&s;e came
to the door. He was &s;ometimes very
<PB N="107" REF="109">
grave, and even dejected for a few mo|ments,
then tried by hurry and bu&s;tle to
drive away his dejection. I a&s;ked him why
he went to the South of France, where he
had been before, rather than to Spain and
Sicily, which he had often expre&s;&s;ed an
inclination to &s;ee: he an&s;wered, that he
had bu&s;ine&s;s in France; "but it is more
than probable," continued he, "that I may
&s;ee Spain and Sicily, or Turkey for aught
I know, before I return to England."</P>
<P>"And did he," enquired Cele&s;tina
mournfully&mdash;"did he &s;ay nothing of me?
did he not even mention me?"</P>
<P>"Very often," replied Vava&s;our, "for
indeed I forced him into the conver&s;ation."</P>
<P>"Did there <HI>need force</HI> then?" &s;aid Ce|le&s;tina
in a plaintive tone, and ready to
melt into tears.</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered Vava&s;our; "for
though I believe he thought of nothing
&s;o much, he &s;eemed frequently unwilling
to tru&s;t his voice with your name; and
&s;ometimes, after we had been &s;peaking
<PB N="108" REF="110">
of you, he &s;unk into a gloomy reverie, and
reluctantly &s;poke at all. One great object
of his &s;olicitude was your future re&s;idence.
He &s;eemed however very ea&s;y while you
were under Mr. Thorold's protection.
Tell me, are you your&s;elf happy in his fa|mily?"</P>
<P>"Happy!" &s;aid Cele&s;tina; "<HI>can</HI> I be
<HI>happy</HI> any where?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps not ju&s;t now: but you know
what I mean when I u&s;e the common term
<HI>happy.</HI> Are you &s;atisfied with your re&s;i|dence?
Do you mean to continue there?"</P>
<P>"I hardly know," &s;ighed Cele&s;tina,
"what I mean. So heavy, &s;o unexpected
was the blow that fell upon me, that my
&s;tunned &s;en&s;es have not yet recovered it;
and for happine&s;s&mdash;I am afraid it never
can be mine."</P>
<P>"Well, my &s;weet friend, though I
hope and believe otherwi&s;e, we will not
talk now either of our hopes or fears: but
are the family you are with plea&s;ant peo|ple?
of whom do they con&s;i&s;t?"</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111">
"Of Mr. Thorold, to who&s;e worth
you have heard Willoughby do ju&s;tice, of
his wife, his daughter, and, at pre&s;ent, of
two &s;ons."</P>
<P>"Yes, I &s;ee the Captain is among you."</P>
<P>"You know him then?"</P>
<P>"A little. Some friends of mine are
acquainted with him. He is a man of
great gallantry I have heard, and affects
the very fir&s;t world; does he not?"</P>
<P>"Really I hardly know. Yes, I believe
he may be that &s;ort of man."</P>
<P>"Celebrated, I think, for having &s;ent
more young women broken hearted to
Bri&s;tol than either Charles Cavendi&s;h or
Ned Hervey. That is the &s;ort of prai&s;e
that attracts your hearts, while we rattle|headed
fellows, who are very hone&s;t though
not very refined, who &s;ay no more than
we mean, and addre&s;s you&mdash;not as god|de&s;&s;es,
only to laugh at you for believing
us, but as mere mortal women, are called
rakes and libertines and I know not what;
as if twenty &s;uch carele&s;s, I had almo&s;t &s;aid
<PB N="110" REF="112">
harmle&s;s, lads as we are, do half as much
mi&s;chief as one of tho&s;e plau&s;ible, &s;enti|mental,
&s;ighing &s;ycophants, who mean no|thing
but the gratification of their own
paltry vanity."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, Mr. Vava&s;our," cried Ce|le&s;tina,
won a moment from her own an|gui&s;h
by this odd remark, "you &s;eem as
much di&s;compo&s;ed as if the redoubtable
Captain had &s;ent &s;ome favourite of your
own to Bri&s;tol."</P>
<P>"No, upon my &s;oul&mdash;my favourities&mdash;I
&s;peak pretty plainly you know: <HI>my ac|quaintance</HI>
have in every in&s;tance <HI>but one</HI>
lain among people, not ea&s;ily &s;ent to Bri&s;|tol.
Come now don't affect prudery. I
tell you though, Cele&s;tina, that had &s;uch
a fellow &s;ent a &s;i&s;ter of mine to recover
health, ruined by the di&s;appointment of
expectations he had rai&s;ed, I believe I
&s;hould try if I could not &s;top his career."</P>
<P>"It is fortunate then, perhaps, for the
Captain, that you have no &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113">
"I may, however, have friends," added
he, earne&s;tly fixing his eyes on the face of
Cele&s;tina&mdash;"I may have friends, for
whom I may be as much intere&s;ted as
I could be for the neare&s;t relation; and
them I would put upon their guard."</P>
<P>"I would very fain mi&s;under&s;tand you,"
&s;aid Cele&s;tina, "becau&s;e I think you ought
to know that, &s;ituated as I am, I need no
&s;uch precaution: or you mu&s;t have a mean
opinion of me indeed, if, knowing Mr.
Willoughby, you can &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he
who has once been attached to him, can
throw away a thought upon Captain Tho|rold?"</P>
<P>"Aye that's true&mdash;all very true and
very fine; but look ye, my dear Cele&s;tina,
I've no way of judging of others but
from my&s;elf, and (though to be &s;ure I
don't &s;peak from experience in the&s;e ho|nourable
&s;entimental &s;ort of treaties) I
am confoundedly afraid that had I been
engaged to Helen, and found that by
&s;ome cur&s;ed counter &s;troke of fortune her
<PB N="112" REF="114">
divinity&s;hip was not to be had, that after
a little raving and &s;wearing and &s;camper|ing
about the world to get her out of my
head, I &s;hould have fallen in love with&mdash;"</P>
<P>"With Andromache," &s;aid Cele&s;tina,
helping him to a compari&s;on, and &s;miling.</P>
<P>"Oh no!" an&s;wered he, "&s;he was
too wi&s;e and too melancholy for me:
your weeping and tragical beauties would
make me cry, but never could make me
love. Faith I think Bri&s;eis or Chry&s;eis
would have been more to my ta&s;te."</P>
<P>"Or Cre&s;&s;ida perhaps?"</P>
<P>"Oh! &s;he would have &s;uited me ex|actly."</P>
<P>"Well Sir!" &s;aid Cele&s;tina, re-a&s;&s;uming
her gravity, "you undoubtedly follow
the golden rule in judging of others; but
give me leave to a&s;&s;ure you that in the
pre&s;ent in&s;tance it would mi&s;lead you, and
that you are the only man in the world
from whom I could li&s;ten to &s;uch a &s;uppo|&s;ition
without re&s;entment. You, however,
do not, I know, mean to hurt me."</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">
"No that I don't by heaven," cried he,
ki&s;&s;ing her hand, "and &s;o do now tell me
how and when I can &s;ee you again."</P>
<P>"I cannot tell; &s;ince it probably de|pends
on your &s;tay in this country."</P>
<P>"That depends then upon you."</P>
<P>"Upon me!"</P>
<P>"Yes, upon you: for I came down
with no other intention in the world than
to enquire after and &s;ee you; and for that
purpo&s;e only have con&s;ented to undergo
the company of Cranfield and his wife:
very good &s;ort of people indeed, but
confounded bores; who have invited me
down the&s;e two years, and who&s;e invi|tation
nothing but their being within four
miles of Thorold's would have made me
accept."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina was at a lo&s;s what an&s;wer to
make to this, becau&s;e &s;he did not know
whether he meant to impute his &s;olicitude
to the care he took of Willoughby's inte|re&s;t,
or &s;imply to his friend&s;hip for her,
for of any warmer intere&s;t than friend&s;hip
&s;he had not the remote&s;t idea. She had,
<PB N="114" REF="116">
however, no time to an&s;wer, for Monta|gue
Thorold, who had followed them
with his eyes ever &s;ince they parted from
the re&s;t of the company, now came ha&s;tily
on towards them to &s;ay his &s;i&s;ter was re|turning
home.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina rejoined them immediately;
and after Mr. and Mrs. Cranfield and
their gue&s;t had been invited and con|&s;ented
to dine with the Thorold family
the next day, they &s;eparated, Vava&s;our be|traying
a violent inclination to attend
Cele&s;tina home, and &s;eeming to repre&s;s it
with great difficulty from the habit he was
in of doing whatever plea&s;ed him&s;elf with|out
con&s;idering whether what he did was,
according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of the
world, rude or polite. He felt, however,
that to quit his ho&s;pitable friends on the
moment of his arrival would be carrying
his carele&s;ne&s;s a little too far; and there|fore
after lingering as long as he could, he
reluctantly left her to Montague Thorold,
who had walked &s;ilently by her for &s;ome
moments, and wi&s;hed her a good day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA, in who&s;e mind a
thou&s;and painful thoughts had been re|vived
by this interview, was too much
lo&s;t in them to attend to Montague Tho|rold,
who &s;till in &s;ilent dejection walked
by her, while his brother was engaged
with Arabella and his military friends.
Montague had narrowly watched her the
whole time &s;he had been conver&s;ing with
Vava&s;our; and, though hopele&s;s him&s;elf,
could not &s;ee her receive another with
&s;uch an appearance of intere&s;t as he had
remarked towards Vava&s;our, without mor|tification.
"Mr Vava&s;our," &s;aid he at
la&s;t, "for that I think is the gentleman's
name&mdash;Mr. Vava&s;our is an old acquaintance
of yours?"</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118">
"A very particular friend of Mr. Wil|loughby's,"
replied &s;he; "and of cour&s;e
a friend of mine."</P>
<P>"A &s;ingle man I &s;uppo&s;e?"</P>
<P>"I believe &s;o," &s;aid Cele&s;tina; "at
lea&s;t I never heard he was married; and
you &s;ee he has not a very &s;ober, married
look."</P>
<P>"No really, very much otherwi&s;e. But he
does not &s;eem to have communicated any
portion of his gaiety to you."</P>
<P>"I am not indeed greatly di&s;po&s;ed to
be gay," &s;aid Cele&s;tina; "and &s;ince I am
not merry, would it not be as well to be
wi&s;e. Do Mr. Montague, give me that
&s;illy paper: its deten&s;ion is u&s;ele&s;s to you
and di&s;agreeable to me."</P>
<P>"Pardon me then if for once I am
guilty of what offends you. I cannot part
with it. But it is my fir&s;t and &s;hall be my
la&s;t offence."</P>
<P>"I hope &s;o," &s;aid Cele&s;tina very
gravely. "The thing is in it&s;elf of no
<PB N="117" REF="119">
con&s;equence, and I wonder you &s;hould be
&s;o childi&s;hly anxious to keep it."</P>
<P>"Your hands have touched it; your
letters are upon it; you compo&s;ed the
lines."</P>
<P>"Well, Sir," cried &s;he impatiently,
and willing to put an end to a &s;peech to
which &s;he feared the Captain might li&s;ten;
"&s;ince you will not give it me or de&s;troy
it, the only favour I have to a&s;k is, that
you will never &s;peak of it again, either to
me or any other per&s;on."</P>
<P>"A needle&s;s precaution!" exclaimed
he, "a very needle&s;s precaution is the
latter; and, alas! in the former I cannot
tre&s;pa&s;s long, for in a few days, a very
few days, I return to Oxford, and I &s;hall
then be no more liable to excite your di&s;|plea&s;ure:
you will cea&s;e to recollect that
&s;uch a being exi&s;ts."</P>
<P>"No indeed," &s;aid Cele&s;tina; whoever
is dear to Mr. Thorold, to your father, to
whom I am &s;o much obliged, mu&s;t have
<PB N="118" REF="120">
a claim to my recollection and my good
wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>"Oh! how cold does that &s;ound from
tho&s;e lips," &s;aid he, "and how little
tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ive eyes are calculated to talk
of mere good wi&s;hes. They are &s;o en|chanting
when they &s;ay more, when they
look as they did ju&s;t now on Mr. Vava&s;our.
How I envied him the &s;imple "God ble&s;s
"you!" and&mdash;"Adieu, Mr. Vava&s;our," and
the look that accompanied them."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" cried Cele&s;tina. "Really,
Mr. Montague, the &s;tyle to which you
have accu&s;tomed your&s;elf de&s;troys all
conver&s;ation. If however that adieu
was &s;o enviable, I will bid you farewel
with quite as much &s;incerity. God ble&s;s
you, and adieu, Mr. Montague. They
were now very near home, and Cele&s;tina,
ha&s;tening forward, cro&s;&s;ed the garden by
a nearer way and reached her own room.</P>
<P>She there began once more to meditate
on her &s;ituation. Every day that &s;he had
pa&s;&s;ed at Mr. Thorold's hou&s;e had en|crea&s;ed
<PB N="119" REF="121">
her de&s;ire to leave it, and &s;he now
more than ever regretted that &s;he knew
not whither to go. Her concern was en|crea&s;ed
by a note brought to her from the
neighbouring village, from whence &s;he
had early that morning &s;ent to her former
abode at Thorpe Heath to enquire whether,
if &s;he had occa&s;ion for them, &s;he could
again have her former lodgings: the an|&s;wer
imported that the old man and his
wife had died within a few days of each
other, the week before, and that the hou&s;e
now belonged to one of the &s;ons, who had
a large family of his own, and intended
to remove into it him&s;elf, as being more
convenient than his former habitation.</P>
<P>This forlorn hope being entirely over,
her reflections on her &s;ituation became
more painful, &s;ince &s;he now knew not one
place in the world where &s;he could with
propriety go. She had once or twice
con&s;ulted Cathcart on the &s;ubject; who
not being aware of the circum&s;tances
which rendered her pre&s;ent abode unea&s;y
<PB N="120" REF="122">
to her, and knowing how much Wil|loughby
de&s;ired her to continue there,
rather di&s;couraged than promoted any
&s;cheme for her removal; flattering him|&s;elf,
that the time was not far di&s;tant when
her pre&s;ence would give, in the opinion of
Je&s;&s;y and his own, a charm to the hou&s;e
they hoped to call their own.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina was well aware of his rea&s;ons
for wi&s;hing her to remain where &s;he was,
and did not love to explain her's for de|&s;iring
to remove, lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould appear
at once fa&s;tidious and vain. She could
not relate to Cathcart, what after all
might be fancy, that Mrs. Thorold did
not love her though &s;he was civil to her;
that Mi&s;s Thorold beheld her &s;ometimes
with di&s;like and never with friend&s;hip;
and that of the two brothers, the elder
often affected to entertain her with conver|&s;ation,
&s;uch as, though &s;he could not
directly complain of it, &s;he could not hear
without being offended and mortified;
while the younger never cea&s;ed pur&s;uing
<PB N="121" REF="123">
her with declarations of romantic attach|ment,
le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ting, but equally if not
more improper for her to li&s;ten to.</P>
<P>In Mr. Thorold &s;he had always a &s;teady
friend and a di&s;intere&s;ted advi&s;er; but to
him &s;he could not &s;tate the rea&s;ons that
made his hou&s;e uncomfortable and his
kindne&s;s u&s;ele&s;s, nor complain that his
wife and daughter &s;lighted, or his &s;ons
made love to her; and though he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
a very uncommon &s;hare of di&s;cern|ment,
he &s;eemed determined not to per|ceive
either him&s;elf. On no plan of re|moval,
however, could &s;he at pre&s;ent de|termine,
and had fixed on nothing but to
find an opportunity to hint her di&s;content
to Vava&s;our, when &s;he was called down to
dinner.</P>
<P>The two military &s;trangers were gone;
but Cele&s;tina found they were engaged to
dine there the next day with the Cranfield
family and Mr. Vava&s;our; and Mrs. Tho|rold,
who piqued her&s;elf above all other
things on giving as good entertainments
<PB N="122" REF="124">
as &s;ome of her neighbours who kept men
cooks, was &s;o impatient to prepare for the
dinner of the next day, that &s;he would
hardly give her&s;elf time to eat that of the
pre&s;ent, but hurried away to her &s;tore
room the in&s;tant the cloth was removed.
Arabella had yet a more important concern
to attend to; Mr. Betten&s;on had been &s;o
lavi&s;h of his compliments, which were in|deed
the only &s;ort of conver&s;ation <HI>be</HI> was
at all perfect in, that &s;he had no doubt of
having made, if not an ab&s;olute conque&s;t,
at lea&s;t &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his heart
as another interview would make inde|lible;
and though his extravagant prai&s;es,
and the heavy language of two rolling
black eyes, (which in lu&s;tre and &s;hape
Montague compared to two pickled wal|nuts,)
had not &s;o far blinded the judg|ment
of Arabella but that &s;he &s;aw he was
extremely weak, &s;he con&s;idered his great
fortune, and that if he could not lead, he
would probably &s;ubmit to be driven, for
which &s;he thought &s;he had all po&s;&s;ible ta|lents
<PB N="123" REF="125">
and was &s;ure &s;he had all po&s;&s;ible
inclination. He had not a title indeed,
but was the third or fourth cou&s;in of a man
that had; of cour&s;e he was a man of fa|mily
him&s;elf; and had he not been &s;o, had
his birth been mean and his per&s;on le&s;s
tolerable, his fortune would not have &s;uf|fered
her a moment to con&s;ider either as of
any con&s;equence. But though &s;he enter|tained
a very great inclination, and a very
well grounded hope to &s;ecure Betten&s;on,
&s;he had not the lea&s;t objection to make an
experiment at the &s;ame time on Vava&s;our,
who had a &s;till better fortune with a very
hand&s;ome figure; and who &s;he had heard
de&s;cribed, as one of tho&s;e agreeable rakes,
who are blamed and loved by all their
acquaintance. She had heard too that he
declared him&s;elf not to be a marrying
man; the greater therefore would be her
glory, &s;hould &s;he happen to charm him
into other &s;entiments; and when &s;he
looked in the gla&s;s &s;he thought nothing
more probable. As to Cele&s;tina, be&s;ides
<PB N="124" REF="126">
her engagements with Willoughby, &s;he
con&s;idered her as quite out of the que&s;tion.
Neither Captain Mu&s;grave or Betten&s;on
had taken any notice of her, and the latter
had declared he thought her far from
hand&s;ome. Arabella therefore &s;aw nothing
to impede her &s;ucce&s;s; and even fancied,
that as &s;he intended to be infinitely lively
and entertaining, the melancholy air and
pen&s;ive face of Cele&s;tina would produce a
contra&s;t extremely to her advantage. While
her mother therefore was bu&s;y with her
jelly and cu&s;tards, Arabella was preparing
her artillery again&s;t the hearts of her ex|pected
gue&s;ts; and Cele&s;tina, who dared
not venture out lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould meet
Montague Thorold, who had placed him|&s;elf
where &s;he could not e&s;cape him, re|mained
the whole evening alone in her
own room, where &s;he formed a &s;ketch of
the letter &s;he intended to write to Wil|loughby.</P>
<P>This employment, by fixing her thoughts
entirely on the object which broke in upon
<PB N="125" REF="127">
every other that at any time of nece&s;&s;ity
engaged them, quieted and &s;oothed her
&s;pirits; &s;he forgot every thing but her wi&s;h to
convince him of her unfailing attachment,
and to pour out before him a heart that was
entirely his own. She determined, how|ever,
not to fini&s;h her letter till after &s;he
had talked to Vava&s;our; and then recol|lected
that &s;he could not tell Willoughby
the re&s;ult of that conference, without a&s;|&s;igning
her rea&s;ons for de&s;iring to quit a
protection, where he had him&s;elf directed
her to remain. This was an irk&s;ome ta&s;k
to her; for if he &s;hould happen to think
her objections frivolous, he would be di&s;|plea&s;ed
that for tho&s;e &s;he removed, and if
he thought them ju&s;t, the idea of rivalry
would add to the unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;he
knew her un&s;ettled &s;ituation would oc|ca&s;ion
to him. Thus undetermined, &s;he
could re&s;t on nothing but the hope that
Vava&s;our might, from his di&s;like to one
or other of the Thorolds, (for he was too
frequently extremely fa&s;tidious and di&s;liked
<PB N="126" REF="128">
with all his heart) agree with her in the
nece&s;&s;ity there was for her change of
abode, without enquiring into all the
rea&s;ons that made her de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>By the bu&s;tle &s;he heard below in the
hou&s;ekeeper's room, which was under part
of her's, and by the frequent running up
and down of Arabella's maid, and the
univer&s;al hurry of the hou&s;ehold, except
Mr. Thorold, who on the&s;e occa&s;ions re|tired
to his &s;tudy for the evening, Cele&s;tina
found &s;he &s;hould rather accommodate than
offend if &s;he declined &s;upping below. She
&s;ent down a note therefore, &s;aying &s;he was
much fatigued with her morning's walk,
and begged to be excu&s;ed for the evening,
and received a verbal an&s;wer that Mrs.
Thorold de&s;ired &s;he would do as was mo&s;t
agreeable to her. Montague, however,
who de&s;pairing of her coming out to walk,
had at la&s;t &s;auntered away alone, no &s;ooner
found on his return that he was not to &s;ee
her at &s;upper, than he went up him&s;elf,
<PB N="127" REF="129">
and tapping &s;oftly at the door, enquired if
&s;he was not well?</P>
<P>"Oh! perfectly well," &s;aid &s;he, "but
tired by my walk of this morning, and
not di&s;po&s;ed to eat any &s;upper."</P>
<P>"Surely," cried he, "if you are tired
you will need &s;omething. You did not
drink tea, and yet will have no &s;upper: let
me get &s;omething for you?"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina declined this however as po|litely
as &s;he could; but Montague was not
to be repul&s;ed &s;o ea&s;ily. He went down
therefore, and returning in a few minutes,
be&s;ought her to open the door and take
&s;ome of the wine and water he had brought
her. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by civility, which it &s;eemed
&s;o rude to refu&s;e and &s;o painful to accept,
&s;he he&s;itated a moment, and then opened
the door, when taking one of the gla&s;&s;es
&s;he thanked him and would have wi&s;hed
him good night; but he looked earne&s;tly
in her face&mdash;"Ah!" &s;aid he, "tears!
you have been weeping again! always in
tears! You have been writing too&mdash;writing
to the fortunate Willoughby?"</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130">
"Pray dont teaze me &s;o," cried Cele&s;|tina:
"if I have cau&s;e for tears, you
&s;hould remember that the greate&s;t kindne&s;s
you can do me is permitting me to indulge
them; and it &s;ignifies not who I write
to."</P>
<P>"It &s;ignifies no more indeed," &s;aid
Montague, with a deep drawn &s;igh, "than
as it excites my envy and my regret."</P>
<P>"Well, well, good night to you," in|terrupted
Cele&s;tina. "Pray dont let me
keep you from &s;upper."</P>
<P>"Oh!" &s;aid he, putting his foot within
the door &s;o as to prevent her &s;hutting it,
"I have had my &s;upper. One look &s;uf|fices
me:

<P>"There, Sir," &s;aid Cele&s;tina coldly,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
"there is my hand, and now good
night."</P>
<P>"Oh that I dared &s;eal my forgivene&s;s
upon it," cried he, eagerly pre&s;&s;ing it.
"But I dare not."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina withdrew her hand, and again
repeating a cold good night, he at length
permitted her to &s;hut the door.</P>
<P>The&s;e frequent declarations, which &s;he
could not affect to mi&s;under&s;tand, greatly
di&s;turbed her; and &s;o well aware was &s;he
of the impropriety of &s;uffering them, that
&s;he was determined no con&s;ideration &s;hould
induce her to remain another week, if Mr.
Montague was not really returning within
that time to Oxford. She had heard him
repeatedly laughed at by his father, his
brother, and his &s;i&s;ter, for his parox|y&s;ms
of love: if his pre&s;ent attention to
her was only a return of the fit, &s;he felt
her&s;elf degraded by being made the object
of it; and if it was more &s;erious, &s;he thought
her&s;elf to blame to &s;uffer his a&s;&s;iduities, on
<PB N="131" REF="133">
account of his father, though &s;he knew
not very well how to put an end to them.
Much le&s;s appearance of pa&s;&s;ion would
have made many young women believe
him ready to take the lover's leap, or to
apply laudanum or gunpowder as a re|medy;
but Cele&s;tina, though not uncon|&s;cious
of her per&s;onal advantages, had none
of that overweening vanity which make &s;o
many of inferior attractions fancy them|&s;elves
irre&s;i&s;tible, nor any of that unfeeling
coquetry, which would be gratified by
the de&s;pair of a man capable of real attach|ment:
&s;he wi&s;hed to put an end to Mon|tague's
per&s;ecuting admiration both for his
&s;ake and her own; and after &s;ome reflec|tions,
concluded, that it would be better
to take an opportunity of &s;peaking to him
the next day, and declaring to him that
his extravagant behaviour would compel
her to quit the hou&s;e and lo&s;e the ac|quaintance
of his family; for &s;he thought,
notwith&s;tanding all his romantic flights, he
had &s;o much good &s;en&s;e, that he would &s;ee
<PB N="132" REF="134">
the impropriety, and indeed the cruelty of
his conduct, if it were once fairly repre|&s;ented
to him. She now almo&s;t repented
that &s;he had not li&s;tened with more pa|tience
to the boa&s;ting egoti&s;m of the Cap|tain,
and had taken &s;helter from his equi|vocal
compliments in the more agreeable
becau&s;e more literary conver&s;ation of Mon|tague;
and again &s;he reflected, with bitter|ne&s;s
of heart, that whether Montague went
or &s;tayed, his brother's character, and in|deed
his manners towards her, made her
remaining where &s;he was extremely im|proper;
yet that no eligible &s;ituation of|fered:
and for the fir&s;t time, &s;ince &s;he had
left Lady Molyneux, &s;he formed a half
wi&s;h to be again with her, though &s;he
knew &s;he had there little kindne&s;s and no
real friend&s;hip to expect.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE preparations for a &s;plendid din|ner
&s;ucceeded admirably, and Mrs. Tho|rold
was in high good humour when her
gue&s;ts arrived. Arabella was &s;till better
plea&s;ed; for Betten&s;on, immediately on
his entrance, had prote&s;ted that &s;he never
looked &s;o well in her life, and Mu&s;grave
whi&s;pered to her, that "if &s;he minded her
hits &s;he would be &s;ure of the pretty boy,"
for &s;o he, the Cornet, was termed by his
Captain. Intelligence &s;o conveyed would
have di&s;gu&s;ted and offended a young wo|man
of delicacy, but Belle Thorold was
too eager for conque&s;t, and too re&s;olutely
bent on &s;ecuring a man of fortune, to
feel or to re&s;ent the freedom of this addre&s;s
from Mu&s;grave, to who&s;e prai&s;es of her
<PB N="134" REF="136">
&s;he knew much of the attention of Betten|&s;on
was owing. Mr. and Mrs. Cranfield
and Vava&s;our &s;oon after arrived; and Ce|le&s;tina
&s;aw with &s;urpri&s;e the pains Mi&s;s
Thorold took at once to attract the notice
of Vava&s;our, and encrea&s;e the admiration
of Betten&s;on. She had never before &s;een
her in the company of young unmarried
men of fortune, and now ob&s;erved with
concern how totally &s;he defeated her own
purpo&s;e. She threw her&s;elf into number|le&s;s
attitudes which &s;he fancied becoming;
applied her hand ince&s;&s;antly to rectify a
curl, or adju&s;t her necklace, by which &s;he
thought to di&s;play it's beauty as well as
that of her hair, and her throat, which &s;he
had been taught to fancy eminently hand|&s;ome.
 She whi&s;pered about nothing,
laughed at &s;ome joke which nobody un|der&s;tood
but her&s;elf and Mu&s;grave, then
affected to be angry at &s;omething he &s;aid
to her, then talked to him by &s;igns acro&s;s
the table, and by way of being charming
was rude and childi&s;h. But this &s;ort of
<PB N="135" REF="137">
behaviour &s;he had &s;een practi&s;ed by &s;ome
very fa&s;hionable young women; it was
perfectly adapted to the level of Betten&s;on's
capacity; and &s;he had not judgment enough
to &s;ee that it mu&s;t offend any man who
had either good &s;en&s;e or good breeding.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, who in the pre&s;ence of Cele&s;|tina
would have &s;een perfect beauty or ex|traordinary
merit with indifference, took
no other notice of Arabella than ju&s;t &s;erved
him to remark to Cele&s;tina that &s;he was
one of the mo&s;t conceited and pert girls he
had ever &s;een. This &s;erved, as they
walked after tea in the garden, to intro|duce
the di&s;cour&s;e &s;he wi&s;hed to hold with
him: but it was extremely difficult to
e&s;cape a moment from the vigilant a&s;&s;iduity
of Montague Thorold. "Pray," &s;aid &s;he
to Vava&s;our, "pray be more guarded: her
brother will hear you."</P>
<P>"And that brother," &s;aid he, &s;ome|what
abruptly, "you &s;eem very much
afraid of offending, though he &s;eems to
<PB N="136" REF="138">
me to be a puppy; how can you let him
prate to you as he does?"</P>
<P>"Indeed," replied Cele&s;tina, "you
would not di&s;like him if you knew him;
and it is amazing to me that you, who are
really &s;o good humoured, &s;hould take &s;uch
di&s;likes to people before you can po&s;&s;ibly
know them."</P>
<P>"And when I do know them I often
di&s;like them more. Why now, in this
family, who is there but the father that has
any under&s;tanding, and he has too much
of the prie&s;t about him. But here comes
your highflying Oxonian. Surely it's hard
not to have a moment with you, though
I want to talk to you about Willoughby."</P>
<P>"I will &s;peak to Mr. Montague," &s;aid
&s;he, "and tell him &s;o." She then &s;tepped
back a few paces, and meeting Montague
Thorold, who was approaching to join
them, &s;he told him that Mr. Vava&s;our had
&s;omething to communicate to her on be|half
of their mutual friend Willoughby,
and that &s;he &s;hould e&s;teem her&s;elf obliged
<PB N="137" REF="139">
to him if he would prevent their being in|terrupted
for a few moments.</P>
<P>Montague, with a melancholy and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive
look, laid his hand on his heart
and &s;aid&mdash;"One word from you is enough
to him who lives but to obey you." He
then went back to the re&s;t of the party,
ca&s;ting a wi&s;tful look after Cele&s;tina, who,
turning into another walk with Vava&s;our,
&s;aid eagerly&mdash;"Well, and now what have
you to &s;ay to me from Willoughby? have
you heard from him?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Vava&s;our; "I could
not well do that &s;ince ye&s;terday, nor do I
indeed expect it for &s;ome time to come:
but do you know, Mi&s;s De Mornay, that I
con&s;ider my&s;elf as Willoughby's repre&s;enta|tive,
as a &s;ort of guardian to you, and am
going in that character to talk to you very
&s;eriou&s;ly."</P>
<P>"Well," cried Cele&s;tina, con&s;cious
that her own conduct was irreproachable,
"my &s;age guardian and reverend monitor,
<PB N="138" REF="140">
begin then with your remon&s;trance or ex|hortation,
whichever it is to be."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t give me leave to be &s;erious
on this occa&s;ion," an&s;wered he.</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t willingly," replied Cele&s;tina,
interrupting him; "and the more &s;o be|cau&s;e
I never remember in all our former
conver&s;ations to have had one &s;erious di&s;|cour&s;e
with you, and I long to &s;ee how you
acquit your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I don't like the people you are with,"
&s;aid he, "and wi&s;h you were any where
el&s;e."</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h I were any where el&s;e my&s;elf;
yet I like the family, and believe them to
be very good &s;ort of people."</P>
<P>"Come, come, Cele&s;tina, you cannot
be ignorant of what I mean: Captain Tho|rold,
as I told you ye&s;terday, is that dan|gerous
and hateful character, a male co|quet."</P>
<P>"He never coquets with me I a&s;&s;ure
you," &s;aid &s;he, "for I never give him an
opportunity."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141">
"No, becau&s;e at pre&s;ent his brother has
the advantage of him. If you do not co|quet
with the military man, at lea&s;t you
li&s;ten to the &s;cholar, and it may be he is
the mo&s;t dangerous of the two. It is the
general idea of the country that he is in
love with you; that&mdash;</P>
<P>"The general idea of the country!"
cried Cele&s;tina; "how can the country
po&s;&s;ibly know any thing about him or about
me?"</P>
<P>"My dear friend," interrupted Vava|&s;our,
"you cannot be ignorant that in
the&s;e places the people could not exi&s;t if
their curio&s;ity did not keep their idlene&s;s
from total &s;tagnation. They will talk, and
let them about one another, but I won't
have them talk of you, who are of ano|ther
order of beings: in &s;hort, I am jealous
of you <HI>for my friend,</HI> and don't like to
hear that Lord Ca&s;tlenorth has paid off all
Willoughby's incumbrances, and that he
has procured him the rever&s;ion of his titles,
to engage him to break off his connection
<PB N="140" REF="142">
with you, which it is &s;aid he formed before
he came of age, and therefore thought him|&s;elf
obliged to fulfil."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina cried with great emotion&mdash;"Dear
Sir! but how fal&s;e and fooli&s;h is
all this."</P>
<P>"It is &s;o," re&s;umed Vava&s;our; "and
what follows is equally or more &s;o, yet it is
I find generally believed."</P>
<P>"And what is it?"</P>
<P>"Why that Willoughby, having &s;cru|ples
about &s;uddenly leaving you, and leav|ing
you in comparative indigence, Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth has given you five thou&s;and
pounds; which, with what was before left
you by Mrs. Willoughby, and the promi&s;e
of a very con&s;iderable living in the gift of
the Ca&s;tlenorths to a clergyman if you
marry one, have rendered you a de&s;irable
object in Mr. Thorold's eyes as a wife for
his younge&s;t &s;on, whom finally you have
accepted of, and are to be married to very
&s;oon; as Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman has in&s;i&s;ted
upon this before &s;he gives her hand to her
<PB N="141" REF="143">
cou&s;in, which is al&s;o to happen very &s;oon
in Italy."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman!" &s;aid Cele&s;tina;
turning pale; "and pray, my good Va|va&s;our,
where have you learned this le|gend?"</P>
<P>"In London," replied he, "I collected
enough to make-me unea&s;y about your &s;i|tuation.
I picked up more &s;ince I came
down to Cranfields, for his wife is a go&s;|&s;ip
of the fir&s;t preten&s;ions; and as to the
Fitz-Hayman part of the &s;tory, their going
abroad &s;o &s;oon after Willoughby has, I take
it for granted, confirmed it in the opinion
of every body."</P>
<P>"Are they gone abroad then?" &s;aid
Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>"So &s;ay the new&s;papers; and I fancy
rightly." He then took one from his
pocket and read this paragraph:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>Ye&s;terday Lord and Lady Ca&s;tle|north,

Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman, with a great retinue,
&s;ailed from hence on their way to the
South of Europe.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Cele&s;tina was &s;ilent a moment; for not
all her faith on the unchangeable affections
of her lover could guard her from a mo|mentary
&s;hock: recovering her&s;elf how|ever,
&s;he &s;aid&mdash;"They may be, and I
&s;uppo&s;e <HI>are</HI> gone; but&mdash;certainly&mdash;cer|tainly
Mr. Willoughby had no &s;hare in
their going. You &s;urely do not think he
had? As we know &s;ome part&mdash;great part
of what you have heard, to be utterly
fal&s;e and unfounded, why may it not all be
&s;o? Certainly you do not believe any of it."</P>
<P>"Pardon me," an&s;wered Vava&s;our, "I
believe that this young man, this Monta|gue
Thorold, is what they call in love with
you; for the re&s;t, I know &s;ome of it is fal&s;e,
and I believe the greate&s;t part of it is &s;o."</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven! you have doubts
then, Vava&s;our: doubts whether Wil|loughby&mdash;But
it is impo&s;&s;ible you <HI>can</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="145">
doubt it. You know he is all honour, ge|nero&s;ity,
integrity, and goodne&s;s."</P>
<P>"I know I always thought &s;o, or I
&s;hould not have loved him better than any
man breathing. But don't let me alarm
you; I cannot doubt when I recollect all I
ever knew of my friend: yet I very ho|ne&s;tly
tell you, that the my&s;tery he made
to me of his rea&s;ons for going abroad, the
gloomy reveries in which I &s;o often &s;aw
him, his evident &s;truggles with him&s;elf,
and a thou&s;and odd circum&s;tances which
&s;truck me when we were la&s;t together&mdash;upon
my &s;oul, Cele&s;tina, I know not what
to think, and &s;hould deceive you were I
to tell you that I have no doubts: yet they
ari&s;e rather from my mi&s;tru&s;t of human na|ture
in general than my opinion of George
as an individual: but when I look at you,
and remember that he was within one day
of calling you his, I cannot upon any com|mon
principles account for his conduct,
and am &s;ure that no common motives can
ju&s;tify it."</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146">
Cele&s;tina, who&s;e heart &s;unk within her
while it could not deny the ju&s;tice of this
remark, &s;ighed deeply, but remained &s;ilent;
and Vava&s;our went on&mdash;"Be <HI>his</HI> motives,
however, what they may, it is certainly
your determination to await the event of
this my&s;terious journey?"</P>
<P>"It is certainly," &s;aid &s;he faintly.</P>
<P>"Well then, is there not any more eli|gible
&s;ituation for you than one where you
are the &s;ubject of &s;uch reports as I have ju&s;t
repeated to you? Suppo&s;e, if it be only
for &s;uppo&s;ition &s;ake, they were to reach
Willoughby: if he &s;till loves you&mdash;"</P>
<P>"If!" repeated Cele&s;tina; "good hea|ven!
you believe then that it admits of a
que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"I did not mean to hurt you. But my
dear Cele&s;tina, there is nothing &s;o in&s;ecure
as our affections I am afraid; and you
mu&s;t recollect too many in&s;tances of their
change to &s;uppo&s;e it <HI>quite</HI> impo&s;&s;ible that&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well, I will interrupt you no more.
If then&mdash;if Willoughby &s;till loves me&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147">
"He will &s;uffer extremely from &s;uch a
report; and &s;hould&mdash;though I allow it to
be very improbable&mdash;<HI>&s;hould</HI> any change
have happened, your apparent approbation
of Montague Thorold will ju&s;tify that ca|price
which nothing el&s;e <HI>can</HI> ju&s;tify."</P>
<P>"Ah! Vava&s;our," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, in
faultering accents, "I &s;ee, I too evidently
&s;ee, that you believe your friend is lo&s;t to
me for ever, and that all you have now
&s;aid is merely to prepare me for a blow,
which, if it fell on me &s;uddenly, would,
you think, de&s;troy me; but believe me,
Vava&s;our, believe me, &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;uch as I
have long endured&mdash;&s;uch as I at this mo|ment
endure&mdash;is, I <HI>think,</HI> more in&s;upporta|ble
than any certainty could be, unle&s;s it
were the certainty that Willoughby is more
mi&s;erable than I am: that I think I could
not bear: but for the re&s;t, however I might
&s;uffer in my pride or in my love, I tru&s;t
that my mind would in time be reconciled
to whatever is inevitable; and perhaps,"
continued &s;he, &s;truggling with the violent
<PB N="146" REF="148">
emotion &s;he felt&mdash;"perhaps that very
pride might a&s;&s;i&s;t me to cure the angui&s;h
of di&s;appointed and improperly indulged
affection. But yet it is &s;urely impo&s;&s;ible
Willoughby <HI>can</HI> have acted as the&s;e &s;u&s;|picions
in regard to Mi&s;s Fitz Hayman
would make me imagine, and &s;till write as
he writes to me! However, Vava&s;our, I
again entreat you, if you know more than
I do, to conceal nothing from me through
mi&s;placed and needle&s;s tenderne&s;s."</P>
<P>"You know me very little," an&s;wered
Vava&s;our, "or you would know how little
concealment and di&s;&s;imulation are in my
nature. My dear Mi&s;s De Mornay, I have
faithfully related to you all I know of our
friend, and even my half formed doubts I
have not attempted to conceal from you:
be now equally ingenuous with me, and
tell me, whether you think your pre&s;ent
&s;ituation is either the mo&s;t plea&s;ant or the
mo&s;t eligible you could po&s;&s;ibly chu&s;e."</P>
<P>"It is not plea&s;ant," an&s;wered Cele&s;tina,
"becau&s;e I am not mi&s;tre&s;s of my time;
<PB N="147" REF="149">
but it is eligible &s;urely, becau&s;e Willough|by
him&s;elf in &s;ome mea&s;ure placed me in it,
and it is to his wi&s;hes I am to attend while
he is yet intere&s;ted about me, and not to
the vague and unfounded reports of peo|ple
who care nothing whether I am happy
or mi&s;erable, &s;o long as they have &s;ome|thing
to talk of."</P>
<P>"But reflect a moment whether Wil|loughby,
when he mentioned his de&s;ire of
your continuing here, was aware that Cap|tain
Thorold would <HI>therefore</HI> remain at
home all the &s;ummer, or that Montague
Thorold would chu&s;e to make you the
object of his romantic pa&s;&s;ion, and the &s;ub|ject
of his poetical panegyric: you cannot
but know that he does both; and were <HI>you</HI>
wilfully blind to it, his behaviour to-day
would have &s;ufficiently convinced <HI>me.</HI>"</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina could not deny his extreme
particularity in company, and his private
declarations were le&s;s equivocal: without
however acknowledging either to Vava&s;our,
&s;he &s;aid in general, that for many rea&s;ons
<PB N="148" REF="150">
&s;he &s;hould not be di&s;plea&s;ed to change her
re&s;idence if &s;he knew whither to go.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our then began to lament that he
had no mother, no &s;i&s;ter, of who&s;e friendly
reception of her he could be a&s;&s;ured; "but,"
added he, "my dear Mi&s;s De Mornay,
give me a day or two, and &s;ome proper
place will perhaps occur to me, or rather
to an excellent female friend whom I will
apply to. In the mean time I will &s;ee
Cathcart, as I propo&s;e to ride over to Al|ve&s;tone
to-morrow, and we will talk the
bu&s;ine&s;s over together." He then took
her hand, and in a manner more tender
and le&s;s lively than was u&s;ual with him,
a&s;ked her if &s;he would pardon him for any
thing he might have &s;aid to give her pain.
Cele&s;tina a&s;&s;ured him &s;he could not forgive
becau&s;e &s;he had never been offended, but
that &s;he mu&s;t ever be greatly obliged to
him for the friendly part he had taken; and
then, fearing that &s;ome invidious remarks
might be made by the company they had left
if they were any longer ab&s;ent, &s;he de&s;ired
<PB N="149" REF="151">
Vava&s;our to rejoin them, while &s;he went
for a few moments to her own room to re|cover
from the &s;till apparent emotion which
&s;he had been thrown into from what had
pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>She had hardly, however, time to breathe,
before &s;he &s;aw Montague Thorold walking
anxiou&s;ly on the lawn before her windows,
looking towards them as if he knew &s;he
was returned to her apartment, and almo&s;t
immediately afterwards Mr. Cranfield's
carriage drove up to the door to take them
home. Cele&s;tina now, therefore, com|po&s;ing
her&s;elf as well as &s;he was able,
ha&s;tened down to the company, who, ex|cept
Montague and Vava&s;our, were hardly
con&s;cious of her rejoining them: Mr.
Cranfield being bu&s;ied in giving to the
elder Mr. Thorold a long detail of a cau&s;e
that had been lately decided at the &s;e&s;&s;ions
in which he had a principal &s;hare; Mrs.
Thorold and Mrs. Cranfield engaged in

in which the&s;e good ladies were migh|tily
intere&s;ted; while Mi&s;s Thorold was
violently flirting with Betten&s;on; and the
other two military men walking together,
were talking over their former adventures,
and Mu&s;grave laughing at Captain Tho|rold
for being thrown out, as he termed it,
by his brother with Cele&s;tina. "What
the devil," &s;aid he, "d'ye bury your&s;elf
alive in this manner for; if Montague is to
&s;upplant you? Faith, my dear Edmund, 'tis
&s;o much again&s;t the honour of us all, that
if you don't make more progre&s;s I &s;hall try
what I can do my&s;elf. Don't you &s;ee that
her attachment to Willoughby is all &s;tuff,
and that &s;he throws out her lure for this
Vava&s;our? If you like her, what a cur&s;ed
fool you mu&s;t be to let her &s;lip through
your fingers."</P>
<P>"As to liking," replied Captain Tho|rold,
"you don't &s;uppo&s;e I intend to
<PB N="151" REF="153">
commit matrimony. The girl is hand&s;ome,
and has more &s;en&s;e than mo&s;t of them&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And therefore 'tis more worth a man's
while to make a fool of her. There I
perfectly agree with you; for though, if I
were condemned by any devili&s;h mi&s;chance
to marry, I &s;hould dread nothing &s;o much
as one of your &s;en&s;ible women, yet it is
glorious to &s;ee how a little fooli&s;h flattery
can &s;et the &s;en&s;e of the &s;hrewde&s;t of them
at nought. But by the way, Edmund,
how did you get off with that bu&s;ine&s;s in
Ireland?"</P>
<P>"Which? for I had &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s
upon my hands that I don't know what you
mean."</P>
<P>"Why between you and Mi&s;s Obrien:
was there not an impertinent brother or&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Oh! aye poor Fanny Obrien. 'Twas
the old &s;tory: Fanny was very pretty, and
faith I was very fond of being with them
all, for there were three others, all &s;weet
little dears. Their mother, a good &s;ort of
a widow, was a little upon the <HI>qui vive</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="154">
when &s;he heard I had a fortune and &s;o
forth, and &s;omehow or other I lived a good
deal at the hou&s;e, and talked non&s;en&s;e to
the girls in my way you know, till this
Mi&s;s Fanny took it into her head to fancy
her&s;elf in love with me, and to &s;uppo&s;e I
had told her that I was &s;o with her, though
if I did upon my &s;oul 'twas only by impli|cation.
I dangled to be &s;ure, and dined
and danced with her; but I meant no|thing,
and was obliged at la&s;t to tell her
mother &s;o, who very plainly &s;ignified to
me, one evening after I had pa&s;&s;ed the
day with them, that it was time to under|&s;tand
me. Well, I gave her to under&s;tand
then, as civilly as I could though, for
faith they were a good &s;ort of a family, that
I had no thoughts of marrying, and the
good gentlewoman waxed wrath about it,
and told me I had done a very unhand|&s;ome
thing in winning her daughter's af|fections.
I could only lament they were
&s;o ea&s;ily won, and return them undamaged
by me. Something I &s;aid, however, gave
<PB N="153" REF="155">
Mrs. Obrien offence, and &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee
me no more; a prohibition which I of
cour&s;e did not attempt to di&s;obey; and
&s;ome other pretty girl falling in my way,
faith I thought no more of my poor Fanny,
till being one night at an a&s;&s;embly at Dub|lin,
I &s;aw a great bu&s;tle &s;oon after my en|trance,
and was told that Mi&s;s Obrien had
fainted away upon &s;eeing me, and was
gone home extremely ill. 'Twas no fault
of mine you know that the girl was &s;o
&s;imply &s;u&s;ceptible: but her brother, a
fierce young &s;ailor, who came a day or
two afterwards from his &s;hip, thought
otherwi&s;e, and talking to me rather cava|lierly,
we agreed that the matter mu&s;t be
&s;ettled in the Phoenix Park by a brace of
pi&s;tols. <HI>Un beau jour</HI> we accordingly met
there, and exchanged each a couple of
&s;hot with all po&s;&s;ible politene&s;s, in which
it was my fortune to lodge a bullet in the
&s;le&s;h of his left arm, which was immediately
extracted. I heard there was no danger;
and as he was of cour&s;e &s;atisfied, I came
<PB N="154" REF="156">
off to England the next day, having taken
my pa&s;&s;age &s;ome time before."</P>
<P>"Your folks here at home never heard
of the hazard you ran?"</P>
<P>"No, I believe not. My father is a
little too apt to lecture and preach on &s;uch
occa&s;ions, and &s;o 'tis as well &s;unk I be|lieve;
and &s;ince I've been in England faith
I've had no inclination to amu&s;e my&s;elf in
the &s;ame way, nor indeed any opportunity,
except with this Cele&s;tial beauty, and &s;he
don't &s;eem to take to me."</P>
<P>"The greater will be the glory," re|plied
Mu&s;grave. "I own I &s;hould like
of all things, were I thee, to drive out a
&s;olemn, &s;ettled, &s;entimental affection from
&s;uch a heart as her's, and jockey thy bro|ther
Montague."</P>
<P>Here the gentlemen were interrupted
by the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Cran|field
and Vava&s;our; after which Mu&s;grave
and Betten&s;on took leave them&s;elves, hav|ing
fir&s;t received a general invitation from
Mrs. Thorold and her daughter; who,
<PB N="155" REF="157">
though by no means plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve
that Vava&s;our, entirely occupied by Cele&s;|tina,
had beheld and heard her with frigid
indifference, was yet much con&s;oled by
being almo&s;t certain that &s;he had &s;ecured
the heart of the little Cornet. She judged
very right. Mu&s;grave, to who&s;e care the
father of Betten&s;on had recommended him,
had purpo&s;ely introduced him to Arabella
Thorold, under the idea of detaching him
from two milleners, to both of whom he
had been making very &s;erious love ever
&s;ince his re&s;idence at Exeter; and the elder
Mr. Betten&s;on was &s;o de&s;irous of &s;aving
him from a connection of that kind, which
he was thus likely to form, that he no
&s;ooner heard of his growing partiality to
Mi&s;s Thorold, than he be&s;ought Captain
Mu&s;grave by every po&s;&s;ible means to en|courage
it, declaring that fortune alone was
no object to him, and that he &s;hould con&s;i|der
him&s;elf happy if his &s;on was fixed in
his choice of the daughter of &s;o worthy and
re&s;pectable a man as Mr. Thorold.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;hort remainder of the evening
pa&s;t very unplea&s;antly to Cele&s;tina while
&s;he continued in company, for Montague,
to whom &s;he could not prevail upon her|&s;elf
to be rude, was yet &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied, either
from the con&s;traint he ob&s;erved &s;he wore
towards him, or from her long conference
with Vava&s;our, that he could not conceal
his concern, and &s;ighed &s;o loud and &s;o
long, as to attract notice and &s;ome very
acrimonious &s;peeches from his mother.
Mr. Thorold too, &s;he thought, looked un|ea&s;y,
and Arabella evidently di&s;liked her
more than before; while the Captain's rude
examination of her countenance, from
which &s;he always &s;hrunk, was now more pain|ful
to her than ever. She got away as &s;oon
<PB N="157" REF="159">
as po&s;&s;ible; but was far, very far from
finding repo&s;e in &s;olitude. All that Va|va&s;our
had &s;aid now returned to torture
her; and in&s;tead of finding &s;leep when &s;he
retired to her pillow, the &s;ame unea&s;y
thoughts and harra&s;&s;ing conjectures which
had long rendered it of difficult acquire|ment,
had now received &s;uch a reinforce|ment
as made it impo&s;&s;ible for her to &s;leep
at all.</P>
<P>She ro&s;e with the dawn of day, hoping
&s;he might in the cour&s;e of it &s;ee Cathcart;
and yet from him &s;he had little to expect
as to her removal, unle&s;s he could find for
her &s;ome farm hou&s;e in the neighbourhood
of Je&s;&s;y, where &s;he might have board and
lodging. But even to this &s;cheme there
were objections: it would be too near the
Thorold's: the young men might &s;till vi&s;it
her, and the reports &s;till obtain which Va|va&s;our
had repeated to her; becau&s;e, though
Montague was really, &s;he found, returning
to Oxford in a few days, there would be
other occa&s;ions of his being at home. It
<PB N="158" REF="160">
was al&s;o too near Alve&s;tone, which, &s;ince
&s;he almo&s;t de&s;paired now of &s;eeing again
with plea&s;ure, &s;he wi&s;hed to e&s;cape &s;eeing
even at the di&s;tance from which &s;he fre|quently
beheld it; when the clump of
firs and &s;ome of the high grounds in the
park, con&s;picuous from almo&s;t every part
of the country within ten or fifteen miles,
often drew from her heart many a bitter
&s;igh.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock, &s;he &s;aw Cathcart
enter the little lawn before the hou&s;e and
immediately went down to him. He ap|proached
her with more than ordinary
cheerfulne&s;s; but in an&s;wering her que&s;|tions
told her he had not heard from Mr.
Willoughby.</P>
<P>"I flattered my&s;elf you had," &s;aid Ce|le&s;tina,
&s;inking again into dejection, "for
I thought, Cathcart, you &s;eemed unu&s;ually
cheerful."</P>
<P>"If any thing could make me long &s;o,"
replied he, "when you, my dear Madam,
and my noble friend are divided and un|ea&s;y,
<PB N="159" REF="161">
it would be the intelligence I have
received about my &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e &s;ituation,
you know, and my &s;olicitude for her and
her children; was indeed the only one Mr.
Willoughby's goodne&s;s would have left
me, if he had him&s;elf been as happy as he
de&s;erved to be."</P>
<P>"And what then have you heard," en|quired
Cele&s;tina, "of Mrs. Elphin&s;tone?"</P>
<P>"That her hu&s;band, who has been
long wandering about the world, is at
length &s;ettled, in a very remote &s;ituation
indeed, but one which he happens to like
and which is likely to become profitable.
He is appointed to &s;uperintend the fi&s;heries
e&s;tabli&s;hed by a &s;ociety of gentlemen in
the we&s;tern i&s;lands of Scotland, and is
already put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good hou&s;e
in the i&s;le of Skie. Thither my &s;i&s;ter is
about to follow him; but I have prevailed
upon her to &s;end to me her two younge&s;t
children, whom I &s;hall put to nur&s;e in
&s;ome farm hou&s;e where Je&s;&s;y or I can
vi&s;it them every day: the other two are
<PB N="160" REF="162">
as many as it will be po&s;&s;ible for her to
take care of, and when &s;he is &s;ettled, I
have engaged to conduct the little ones to
her. She has already received money
from Elphin&s;tone to enable her to &s;et out
well equipped, and waits only to &s;ee me
before &s;he takes leave of London, and,
&s;he &s;ays, &s;he hopes for ever."</P>
<P>"And when do you go?"</P>
<P>"I propo&s;e &s;etting out for London on
Thur&s;day, unle&s;s you or Mr. Willoughby
have any commands for me that may de|tain
me longer."</P>
<P>"Alas! Cathcart," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, "I
am afraid you will receive no intelligence
of Willoughby by that time: but I can
find, I believe, &s;omething for you to do
for me which will rather expedite than de|tain
you."</P>
<P>Cathcart then a&s;&s;uring her how happy
every opportunity of &s;hewing his gratitude
would make him, Cele&s;tina &s;aid&mdash;"Well
then, my commands are &s;imply the&s;e, that
in&s;tead of going on hor&s;eback you come
<PB N="161" REF="163">
hither in a po&s;t-chai&s;e on Thur&s;day morn|ing,
and take me with you to &s;ee my dear
Je&s;&s;y, as I cannot go without having that
&s;atisfaction, and afterwards, Cathcart, you
&s;hall take me to London with you,"</P>
<P>Cathcart expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at her
re&s;olution, &s;he told him that &s;he would
account for it as they went; that Devon|&s;hire
was at pre&s;ent very unplea&s;ant to her,
and that &s;he fancied change of place would
relieve her &s;pirits more than all her rea&s;on
and her philo&s;ophy, "which, to tell you the
truth, Cathcart," &s;aid &s;he, "may be accu&s;ed
of acting a little like Horatio; and I
&s;ometimes am tempted to &s;ay to them&mdash;
<Q><L>Is then the boa&s;ted purpo&s;e of your friend&s;hip</L>
<L>To tell Cali&s;ta what a wretch &s;he is?</L>
<L>Alas! what needed that?</L></Q>
But however, I find really, Cathcart, that
I cannot here obey our dear friend in the
points he mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ts upon, tho&s;e of keep|ing
my cheerfulne&s;s and pre&s;erving my
health, and I have a mind to try his
<PB N="162" REF="164">
remedy and ramble a little. Perhaps I
may go to Scotland with your &s;i&s;ter. Do
you think &s;he would admit me as a tra|velling
companion?"</P>
<P>"Admit you, dear Madam," &s;aid
Cathcart. "Surely &s;he would be but too
much honoured. But you can never be
&s;erious?"</P>
<P>"It is, however, very likely that I may
become &s;o. At pre&s;ent, my re&s;olution is
to take leave of this family and go with
you to London. You will &s;ee Vava&s;our
to day, and you may tell him &s;o."</P>
<P>They then &s;ettled the hour at which the
po&s;t-chai&s;e was to be ready for her the
next morning &s;ave one. Cathcart returned
to Alve&s;tone; and Cele&s;tina to the hou&s;e,
where &s;he propo&s;ed taking the earlie&s;t op|portunity
of acquainting Mr. Thorold with
her determination.</P>
<P>She con&s;idered her&s;elf rather as Mr.
Thorold's vi&s;itor than as the gue&s;t of any
other of the family; and wi&s;hed to have
his approbation for the &s;tep &s;he was about
<PB N="163" REF="165">
to take, without however a&s;&s;igning the
rea&s;ons that actuated her to take it. She
had frequently fancied of late that he &s;aw
more than he cho&s;e to notice, and that,
though he was too generous to repent the
friendly invitation he had given her, he
was too prudent not to fore&s;ee ill con&s;e|quences
from her long continuing to ac|cept
it. In the mid&s;t of a large family.
to which he was greatly attached, Mr.
Thorold lived much of his time alone.
His &s;tudy and his pari&s;hioners divided the
day, and, except at dinner and for about
an hour afterwards, his wife and children
&s;aw very little of him. Cele&s;tina was un|ea&s;y
till &s;he had &s;poken to him; and there|fore
when he ro&s;e to go for his walk after
dinner, &s;he enquired whether he would
allow her to go part of the way with him,
as &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak a few words to him
alone.</P>
<P>Montague blu&s;hed deeply as &s;he thus
addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to his father; who led her
however out of the room, and taking her
<PB N="164" REF="166">
arm within his in his u&s;ual friendly way,
took the way towards the village &s;treet,
where he had, he &s;aid, &s;ome patients to
vi&s;it that evening; for he was the phy&s;ician
as well as the pa&s;tor of his people. After
a few minutes of embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ilence on
the part of Cele&s;tina, &s;he collected courage
enough to tell him, that in con&s;equence
of &s;ome intelligence &s;he had learned from
Mr. Vava&s;our, &s;he had determined to go
to London.</P>
<P>"Not under <HI>his</HI> convoy I hope?" cried
Mr. Thorold, eagerly interrupting her.</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered Cele&s;tina, a little
&s;tartled by the manner in which he &s;poke:
"not by any means with him, or under
his care; but with Mr. Cathcart, who is
going on bu&s;ine&s;s of his own."</P>
<P>"You know, my dear Mi&s;s De Mor|nay,"
&s;aid Mr. Thorold very gravely,
"that my hou&s;e and my be&s;t advice are
equally and always at your &s;ervice: you
may have rea&s;ons for quitting the one and
rejecting the other, into which were I to
<PB N="165" REF="167">
enquire it would produce for me nothing
but mortification. I will <HI>not</HI> then enquire;
I will only entreat you to con&s;ider well,
whither and with whom you go. Mr. Va|va&s;our
has, I apprehend, no mother or
&s;i&s;ter, and you cannot be ignorant that he
has the character of indulging him&s;elf in
liberties, which even in this age of free|dom
make him rather a marked man."</P>
<P>"My dear Sir," replied Cele&s;tina, "I
have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of quitting
your protection for one &s;o little proper as
Mr. Vava&s;our's mu&s;t be, though he is the
mo&s;t intimate friend of Mr. Willoughby.
But my meaning merely is&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Come," cried Mr. Thorold, inter|rupting
her, "I will explain your mean|ing,
or rather the meaning of Vava&s;our.
He has been talking to you about my &s;on
Montague. He has repre&s;ented the im|propriety
of your li&s;tening to &s;uch &s;ort of
conver&s;ation as I know Montague has
more than once entertained you with. Is
it not &s;o?"</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="168">
"I own it is," &s;aid Cele&s;tina in &s;ome
confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"I do not blame him," rejoined Mr.
Thorold; "and if his vigilance is the
effect of <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> I commend him. Nor
do I, my dear ward, di&s;approve of your
wi&s;hing to &s;hun the boyi&s;h importunity of
Montague. I only entreat you to reflect
well on your removal, and to remember,
that notwith&s;tanding Mr. Vava&s;our's inti|mate
connection with Willoughby, I con|&s;ider
my&s;elf as having &s;ome claim to your
confidence and as in &s;ome degree an&s;wer|able
for your di&s;po&s;al of your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"You are very good, dear Sir, and
de&s;erve I am &s;ure my gratitude as well as
my confidence. You de&s;erve too that I
&s;hould &s;peak to you with the utmo&s;t &s;in|cerity."
She then related to him, all that
Vava&s;our had &s;aid to her of the reports
that had obtained relative to her and Mr.
Montague; and concluded by &s;aying,
that though &s;he highly e&s;teemed his &s;on,
and had the mo&s;t grateful regard for the
<PB N="167" REF="169">
whole family, &s;he could not li&s;ten to the&s;e
reports without concern, becau&s;e they
might be di&s;plea&s;ing to him and injurious
to views he might have for his &s;on, even
putting her&s;elf out of the que&s;tion. "I
think therefore, dear Sir," added &s;he,
"that it will be better for me to put an
end to my vi&s;it for this time, and to travel
into the North with a &s;i&s;ter of Mr. Cath|cart's,
who is going thither: change of
&s;cene will relieve my &s;pirits, and wandering
give me perhaps a new reli&s;h for the
beauties of Devon&s;hire; where, believe me,
I &s;hall be mo&s;t happy to return, whenever
I can do it without &s;ubjecting my be&s;t
friends as well as my&s;elf to unea&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>"I am vexed," &s;aid Mr. Thorold,
"that the romantic temper of Montague
has made this removal nece&s;&s;ary in your
idea. He goes very &s;oon to Oxford: in|deed
in a few days: and afterwards, per|haps,
you would find my hou&s;e le&s;s objec|tionable.
As to the go&s;&s;ip of the country,
you are I hope too wi&s;e to mind it, and I
<PB N="168" REF="170">
have long &s;ince learned to de&s;pi&s;e it.
<HI>That,</HI> therefore &s;hould not weigh with
me at all. But in return for your charming
&s;incerity, I will &s;peak very plainly to you.
Montague is a young man of good abi|lities,
and of an excellent heart; but the
violence of his pa&s;&s;ions keep me in perpe|tual
concern lea&s;t they &s;hould deprive me
of all the happine&s;s that I may hope to
derive from &s;uch a &s;on: and already I
have twice, with great difficulty, delivered
him from engagements he had made with
young women quite unworthy of him:
engagements which, though he &s;oon &s;aw
the folly and impropriety of them, he
fancied his honour obliged him to keep.
Another&mdash;I know not who; one perhaps
not much &s;uperior to the&s;e, (as I learned by
a friend who keeps a &s;teady eye upon him,)
had &s;ucceeded to the imaginary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his affections when he la&s;t came home.
I was unea&s;y at it; but perhaps con&s;idered
my own feelings too much and your's too
little, when I &s;aw with plea&s;ure his in&s;tant
<PB N="169" REF="171">
admiration of you. I encouraged it,
becau&s;e I hoped, that in learning what
true merit was, he would hereafter be le&s;s
liable to be mi&s;led by the poor &s;emblance
of it, when aided by a pretty face, or a
&s;lender &s;hape: at the &s;ame time I thought
I had &s;ufficiently guarded him again&s;t any
exce&s;s of attachment, by repre&s;enting to
him your &s;ituation and convincing him it
would be not only pre&s;umptuous but hope|le&s;s.
I believe, however, from &s;ome late
ob&s;ervations I have made, that I have
judged ill; and to &s;ave him from maladies
that might be trifling or curable, have ex|po&s;ed
him to the &s;everer misfortune of
feeling a real pa&s;&s;ion where he can meet
with no return."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina could not with &s;incerity di&s;|claim
what &s;he had &s;o much rea&s;on to fear
was true. Affecting, however, to believe
that Mr. Montague would &s;oon lo&s;e the
impre&s;&s;ion when &s;he was no longer pre&s;ent,
and would find many infinitely more wor|thy
of his affection, who might be proud
<PB N="170" REF="172">
to receive and at liberty to return it, &s;he
renewed the &s;ubject of her going to Lon|don,
be&s;ought Mr. Thorold &s;till to honour
her with his friend&s;hip, and promi&s;ed to
return to him again in the winter if no ob|jection
&s;hould ari&s;e to his receiving her.
She heard with gratitude the advice he
gave her about Vava&s;our.&mdash;"Do not,"
&s;aid he, "put your&s;elf too much in his
power under the idea of his being the cho|&s;en
friend of Willoughby. He is called,
and I believe is, a man of honour, in the
common acceptation of the term; but I
am afraid there is little real honour among
tho&s;e who are in any re&s;pect &s;o very licen|tious
as Vava&s;our is &s;aid to be in regard to
your &s;ex; the &s;tile in which he lives among
a certain de&s;cription of women, is not
only the means of degrading all in his
opinion, but hardens the heart while it
corrupts the morals: and with all Vava|&s;our's
boa&s;ted honour, I dare &s;ay he is a
man, who, if he happened to take a
fancy to the mi&s;tre&s;s of his friend, would
<PB N="171" REF="173">
&s;teal her affections and her per&s;on without
he&s;itation, and &s;uppo&s;e, that by an appeal
to the &s;word or pi&s;tol to vindicate the
wrong he had done, the action, however
unprincipled, would derogate nothing
from his honour."</P>
<P>"Sure, Sir," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, "Wil|loughby
would not have &s;o much friend&s;hip
for Mr. Vava&s;our were he &s;uch a man?"</P>
<P>"I don't know, my dear," an&s;wered
Mr. Thorold, "that Vava&s;our is &s;uch a
man; but you will allow at lea&s;t that it is
very probable; and as to Willoughby's
friend&s;hip, I am afraid that is no criterion of
merit. The college friend&s;hips of young
men&mdash;But let me not make you too
much out of humour with the world, while
I mean only to put you upon your guard
again&s;t the evil with which it too often
teems towards unprotected youth and
loveline&s;s. It grieves my heart to let you
go. But&mdash;upon the whole, if you promi&s;e
to write to me often&mdash;to remain with this
&s;i&s;ter of Cathcart's, who is, I conclude, a
<PB N="172" REF="174">
woman of character, and to take no new
cour&s;e without informing me; above all,
to keep your&s;elf quite out of the power of
Vava&s;our, and not to be introduced to
any of his acquaintance by way of &s;taying
with them, unle&s;s you are very certain
who they are; I &s;ay, on all the&s;e condi|tions
I will not oppo&s;e your going, though
it hurts me to con&s;ent to it."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, having thus relieved her mind
by explaining her&s;elf to her generous friend,
became better &s;atisfied than &s;he had been
for &s;ome time, and found at lea&s;t an alle|viation
of the concern that preyed on her
heart, in the idea of change of place. She
parted &s;oon after from Mr. Thorold, who&s;e
bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he was fearful of interrupting,
and walked back towards the hou&s;e, in|tending
to open her intentions of leaving
them, to the re&s;t of the family, when they
were a&s;&s;embled to their tea.</P>
<P>Montague, however, who had never
lo&s;t &s;ight of her, but had followed her and
his father at a di&s;tance during their walk,
<PB N="173" REF="175">
now ha&s;tened acro&s;s the field &s;he was in to
meet her. His eagerly enquiring eyes
were fixed on her face when he came up
to her; but not daring to a&s;k the &s;ubject
of her conference with his father, nor able
to turn his thoughts from it, he only &s;aid&mdash;"Well,
Mi&s;s De Mornay, you have
left my father?"</P>
<P>"You &s;ee I have," &s;aid Cele&s;tina,
&s;miling, "and I have left him well &s;ati&s;|fied
with the rea&s;ons I have given for quit|ting
his ho&s;pitable roof on Thur&s;day."</P>
<P>"Quitting it!" exclaimed Montague,
turning pale&mdash;"quitting it! What are
you going to leave us then? and before I
go to Oxford?"</P>
<P>"My good friend," replied &s;he, "you
did not &s;urely &s;uppo&s;e that I was to be a
perennial vi&s;itor at your father's. I have
now been here almo&s;t a month, and you
mu&s;t certainly allow that to be a very long
vi&s;it from a per&s;on, who, till within five
weeks, had not the good fortune to be
known to your family at all."</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="176">
"I know not," &s;aid Montague, &s;igh|ing,
"what I thought, or what I &s;up|po&s;ed;
but I would to heaven I could for|get
having ever &s;een you, as ea&s;ily as I
am convinced you will lo&s;e the remem|brance
of me."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, with one of tho&s;e fa&s;cinating
&s;miles which lent &s;uch peculiar charms to
her countenance, now a&s;&s;ured him that he
was mi&s;taken: "indeed," &s;aid &s;he, "I
&s;hall always remember you all, with plea|&s;ure
and with gratitude."</P>
<P>"Well," an&s;wered he, "I thank you;
and I thank you for not excepting me,
and by putting us all together, &s;hewing
that you have no particular favourite in the
family, but that one is as indifferent as
another. But however, I wi&s;h you would
not &s;mile, for I cannot bear it."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" cried Cele&s;tina. "I
am amazed, Mr. Montague, that with
your under&s;tanding, you give way &s;o fre|quently
to &s;uch ab&s;urd fits of&mdash;I hardly
know what to call it&mdash;a romantic &s;tile of
<PB N="175" REF="177">
behaviour, which you &s;eem to think wo|men
like, whereas I a&s;&s;ure you that to me
at lea&s;t it is the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant in the
world."</P>
<P>"When did you ever &s;ee me in this ro|mantic
&s;tile, as you are plea&s;ed to term it,
with any woman but your&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"I never did, becau&s;e I happen not to
have &s;een you with any other women than
tho&s;e of your own family: but you know
that yout mother, your &s;i&s;ter and your
brother, nay, even your father, all have
repeatedly &s;aid it was your way with every
body."</P>
<P>"They are mi&s;taken however; and I
own <HI>I</HI> have often mi&s;taken a tran&s;ient de|gree
of liking for love, which I never felt&mdash;no
never&mdash;till I &s;aw you!</P>
<Q><L>For &s;everal virtues</L>
<L>Have I liked &s;everal women; never any</L>
<L>With &s;o full &s;oul, but &s;ome defect in her</L>
<L>Did quarrel with the noble&s;t grace &s;he owed</L>
<L>And put it to the foil: but you!&mdash;oh you!</L>
<L>So perfect and &s;o peerle&s;s, were created</L>
<L>Of every creature's be&s;t.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178">
"There now," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, "that
is exactly what I complain of: there is no
rational conver&s;ation with you, capable as
you are of adorning it; but, as Arabella
very truly &s;ays, you do nothing but make
&s;peeches out of Otway or Shak&s;peare."</P>
<P>"Arabella did not &s;ay I made &s;peeches,
but that I made love; and I make love
becau&s;e I feel it&mdash;feel it to an exce&s;s which
is dreadful, becau&s;e I know, and have
known from the beginning, that it is
hopele&s;s! But as this hurts nobody but
my&s;elf, I don't &s;ee why it &s;hould di&s;plea&s;e
you, or why you &s;hould affect to mi&s;|under&s;tand,
or attempt to laugh off a
pa&s;&s;ion, which, whatever may be its effect
on me, can never di&s;turb your tranquillity
or that of your fortunate lover."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina finding him thus &s;erious,
thought it would be better, and indeed
more generous, not to pretend ignorance
of his meaning, and to rea&s;on with rather
than rally him; &s;he therefore dropped the
gayer tone with which &s;he began the con|ver&s;ation,
<PB N="177" REF="179">
and &s;aid gravely&mdash;"Mr. Mon|tague,
I will not affect then to mi&s;under|&s;tand
you. I am undoubtedly honoured
by your partiality, and very much con|cerned
if it is the &s;ource of pre&s;ent pain to
you. Let it become rather a &s;ource of
plea&s;ure to us both, by reducing it to that
generous and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip which
I may return with &s;atisfaction, and for
tho&s;e warmer &s;entiments, which you now
&s;uppo&s;e are entirely diverted from any
other object, &s;eek one who can de&s;erve
and return them, and &s;pare me, I be&s;eech
you, the pain of believing, even for a
moment, that I have brought &s;olicitude
and &s;uffering into any part of a family to
which I am &s;o much obliged. I need not
tell you my &s;ituation: you know it is a
very comfortle&s;s and a very uncertain one:
perhaps I may never &s;ee Mr. Willoughby
again; or if I do, perhaps I may &s;ee him
the hu&s;band of another. But in either
ca&s;e my attachment to him is unalterable;
and were I &s;ure to-morrow that we are di|vided
<PB N="178" REF="180">
never again to meet, I &s;hould only
think of &s;ubmitting in &s;uch a way as would
lea&s;t wound him, to a blow, which I am
&s;ure he will not voluntarily give me, but
never of running the hazard of making
unhappy &s;ome equally worthy man, by
giving to importunity what I can never
give to love&mdash;for my heart has been Wil|loughby's
ever &s;ince I knew I had one,
and it will be his, till I remember it no
longer."</P>
<P>Montague gave no other an&s;wer to this
than a deep &s;igh; and Cele&s;tina pau&s;ing a
moment to recover her&s;elf from the emo|tion
her words had occa&s;ioned, went on&mdash;"You
love quotations, and undoubtedly
recollect, though perhaps from an author
I ought not to quote, the&s;e words: <HI>Il
n'y a point d'bomme pour celle qui aime;
&s;on amant e&s;t plus, tous les autres &s;ont
moins.</HI>"</P>
<P>Montague now impatiently interrupted
her&mdash;"You need not," &s;aid he, "thus
refine on the cruelty with which you tell
<PB N="179" REF="181">
me that you can never throw away a
thought on me. I knew it before; and in
the wilde&s;t paroxy&s;ms of that pa&s;&s;ion which
I glory in feeling and in cheri&s;hing, I
never dared flatter my&s;elf that you would.
Yet&mdash;perhaps even this fortunate Wil|loughby
him&s;elf&mdash;this happy man, who
may neglect you, leave you for another,
and yet &s;till be beloved&mdash;is not more ca|pable
of an ardent, a &s;incere affection, than
I am. <HI>If</HI> he leaves you for ever&mdash;good
God!&mdash;Even if he entirely de&s;erts you,
you will &s;till love him&mdash;Even then no
other would have any hope."</P>
<P>"None," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, "for then I
will never marry. But, my good friend,
this is an unea&s;y &s;ubject to us both; let us
then never re&s;ume it. Allow me to offer
you my friend&s;hip and my e&s;teem, and to
a&s;&s;ure you that this &s;udden partiality, which
believe me you will &s;oon and ea&s;ily con|quer,
is the only &s;ubject on which I cannot
li&s;ten to you with plea&s;ure."</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="182">
They were now &s;o immediately before
the parlour windows, that Montague, who
&s;aw the family a&s;&s;embled there at tea,
dared not give way to what he felt; but
a&s;ked her, in a lower voice, when &s;he
went. She told him the day after the
morrow. Again he &s;ighed; and when
they got into the hall, turned towards his
own little &s;tudy, which was on the &s;ame
floor, while Cele&s;tina went to join the
party in the parlour; where &s;he found Mr.
Betten&s;on, who &s;he under&s;tood was now
the profe&s;&s;ed lover of Mi&s;s Thorold; and
&s;o entirely did he now occupy the atten|tion
both of her and her mother, that they
hardly noticed the entrance of Cele&s;tina.
She took, however, the earlie&s;t opportunity
of a pau&s;e in their conver&s;ation, to &s;ignify
her de&s;ign of going on the following Thur&s;|day.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Thorold contented her&s;elf with
coldly &s;aying &s;he was &s;orry to lo&s;e her &s;o
&s;oon; and her mother, even le&s;s civil, as
her hu&s;band was not by, &s;aid&mdash;"And
<PB N="181" REF="183">
pray, Mi&s;s De Mornay, where are you
going?"</P>
<P>"To London, Madam."</P>
<P>"To London. Ble&s;s me! and pray who
are you going to there?"</P>
<P>"To a Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, I believe,
Ma'am."</P>
<P>"You believe! and pray when do you
go?"</P>
<P>"On Thur&s;day, Madam."</P>
<P>"And alone?"</P>
<P>"No, Madam."</P>
<P>"Not alone? then who do you go with?"</P>
<P>"With Mr. Cathcart, Madam."</P>
<P>"Oh! with Mr. Cathcart. And pray,
how do you go? In the &s;tage?"</P>
<P>"No, Madam," replied Cele&s;tina,
blu&s;hing at the indelicacy with which all
the&s;e que&s;tions were a&s;ked before a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>"How then pray?"</P>
<P>"In po&s;t chai&s;es, Madam."</P>
<P>"Humph! Po&s;t chai&s;es are expen&s;ive."
Here &s;he &s;topped; being unable to find
any other que&s;tions, or rather not daring
<PB N="182" REF="184">
to a&s;k any more, as her hu&s;band and elde&s;t
&s;on that moment came in with Captain
Mu&s;grave. Cele&s;tina however interpreted
the look &s;he put on, as &s;aying, "no mat|ter
how you go, &s;o long as you do go,"
and again &s;he congratulated her&s;elf on the
re&s;olution &s;he had taken.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA, finding that Montague
Thorold did not join the party, con&s;trained
her&s;elf to &s;tay with them, lea&s;t it &s;hould be
imagined they were together. Captain
Thorold, as if he took advantage of his
brother's ab&s;ence, &s;at down by her, and be|gan
in a half whi&s;per to make her &s;ome of
tho&s;e &s;peeches, between a &s;neer and a compli|ment,
which always confu&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
her. Soon after tea, however, Montague came
in, and then, the evening being rainy,
cards were propo&s;ed, to which his mother
de&s;ired him to &s;it down; while Cele&s;tina,
&s;aying &s;he had a few preparations to make
for her journey which &s;he might as well
begin in time, went away, nobody a&s;king
her to take a &s;eat at the card table.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="186">
She was no &s;ooner gone, than Mrs. Tho|rold,
addre&s;&s;ing her elde&s;t &s;on, &s;aid&mdash;"So,
Edmund, we are to lo&s;e your father's vi&s;itor
at la&s;t, my dear."</P>
<P>"Are we?" &s;aid he carele&s;sly. "What
is her <HI>intended</HI> come back?"</P>
<P>"Oh no," replied his mother, "the
young lady is going to London it &s;eems."</P>
<P>"Lord, Ma'am," cried Betten&s;on,
"I'll tell you what Mu&s;grave and I heard
t'other day; did'nt we Muzzy?"</P>
<P>"Faith I don't know whether we did or
no, Jacky Boy, till you tell me what it was
we heard."</P>
<P>"Why we heard&mdash;Lord why 'twas that
night we drank tea and &s;upped, you know,
with that there family of the Killigrews&mdash;we
heard that Mr. Montague Thorold was a
going to be married to this Mi&s;s De Mor|ning,
and that Mr. What d'ye call him&mdash;he
that was to have had her, had given Mr.
Montague a living to take her off his
hands."</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187">
Either the purport of this &s;peech, or the
manner in which it was delivered, threw
Captain Thorold and his friend Mu&s;grave
into bur&s;ts of laughter, which they very
freely indulged; but poor Montague turned
pale, and trembled with vexation; while
Mrs. Thorold, pur&s;ing her mouth and
drawing her&s;elf up, &s;aid&mdash;"Pray, Mr.
Betten&s;on, <HI>where</HI> did you &s;ay you heard
this &s;tory? Pray, Edmund, what do you
laugh at? I &s;ay&mdash;Mr. Betten&s;on, pray was
it at Mr. Killigrew's you heard this ab&s;urd
&s;tory?"</P>
<P>"Lord yes, Ma'am, and upon my &s;oul
I've heard it el&s;ewhere. Why, Mu&s;grave,
don't you remember?&mdash;why half the people
at Exeter I'm &s;ure have talked to me about
it."</P>
<P>"I'm very &s;orry for it," rejoined the
old lady. "People give their tongues
&s;trange liberties methinks. My &s;on I can
a&s;&s;ure them will never, at lea&s;t with mine
and his father's con&s;ent, form any &s;uch
connection. What! with a foreigner! an
<PB N="186" REF="188">
alien as one may &s;ay! brought up upon
charity, and I dare &s;ay not very honourably
born, or how did Mrs. Willoughby get
her &s;o ea&s;ily from her own country. People
of fa&s;hion don't part with their children to
&s;trangers. For my part, I would be very
civil to a young woman in di&s;tre&s;s, as
'twas Mr. Thorold's whim to have her
here for a little time, but I am very &s;orry
it has given ri&s;e to any &s;uch report, which
I beg the favour of you gentlemen to con|tradict.
A living indeed! it is very likely
that Montague Thorold &s;hould accept of
a living with &s;uch an incumbrance, or on
any &s;uch conditions."</P>
<P>"But Madam," cried Captain Thorold
as he dealt his cards, "what think you if
poor Montague avows his penchant for
the lady, and talks of dying without her
in&s;tead of getting a living with her?"</P>
<P>"Think," replied his mother, redden|ing
with anger&mdash;"why think that he is a
fool, and that you are very little better for
encouraging a &s;illy boy in &s;uch non&s;en&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189">
"Nay, Madam," cried the Captain, "I
am &s;ure I don't encourage him. I was
only pitying him, as one naturally does all
gentle youths who are cro&s;t in love."</P>
<P>Arabella, who knew that her mother
&s;ometimes &s;uddenly threw off her every
day character to appear in one far le&s;s amia|ble,
when unchecked by Mr. Thorold,
now feared that &s;he might give way to one
of the&s;e fits of ill humour and exhibit a
&s;cene before Mr. Mu&s;grave and Mr. Bet|ten&s;on
which might give them no very fa|vourable
idea of the family temper; &s;he
therefore gave her brother Edmund a hint
to forbear pu&s;hing the conver&s;ation any far|ther.
He de&s;i&s;ted; the game went in fa|vour
of Mrs. Thorold; and in the plea&s;ure
of winning five &s;hillings, &s;he forgot for
that time the di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he had conceived
again&s;t her younge&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina was in the mean time pre|paring
for her journey. She had nothing
now but her cloaths to pack up; for her
books and her drawing ca&s;es were at Al|ve&s;tone,
<PB N="188" REF="190">
where Cathcart be&s;ought her to
let them remain a little longer, promi&s;ing
that if events were finally determined other|wi&s;e
than he was &s;till willing to hope, he
would take them all from thence and &s;end
them to her whither&s;oever &s;he might de|&s;ire.
She wi&s;hed mo&s;t earne&s;tly the next
day over: for &s;he had now learned to dread
more than before &s;ome extravagance on the
part of Montague Thorold, for whom,
notwith&s;tanding the trouble &s;he had re|ceived
from his continual per&s;ecutions,
&s;he could not altogether withhold her pity
and her e&s;teem. In his figure he re&s;em|bled
his father, whom &s;he had &s;o much
rea&s;on to regard with grateful affection;
and his faults were merely tho&s;e of youth
and a vivid imagination. Whether his
partiality to her was of a permanent or
tran&s;itory nature, it was pretty certain that
it now gave him pain, of which Cele&s;tina
could not con&s;ider her&s;elf as the cau&s;e with|out
de&s;iring to alleviate or rather to end it.
At &s;upper, however, &s;he learned, with
<PB N="189" REF="191">
great &s;atisfaction, that Mr. Thorold and his
two &s;ons were engaged out for the whole of
the next day, and were to leave home
early in the morning. She fancied, from
&s;everal remarks &s;he made in the cour&s;e of
the evening, that this was purpo&s;ely con|trived:
and the eyes of Montague, though
he dared not otherwi&s;e &s;peak, told her
how cruelly he &s;uffered from an arrange|ment
which would deprive him of almo&s;t
all the opportunities of &s;peaking to her
which her &s;hort &s;tay might yet afford him.
Though he &s;aw that his mother remarked
all his looks, and was re&s;trained only by
the fear of offending his father from
openly avowing the anger &s;he had con|ceived,
he could not forbear watching
every turn of Cele&s;tina's countenance; and,
when he bade her good night at the door,
&s;ighing deeply and &s;aying in a low whi&s;|per&mdash;"At
what time do you go on Thur&s;|day?"</P>
<P>"Early I hope," replied &s;he; and to
avoid all farther que&s;tions ha&s;tened away.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">
The next day pa&s;&s;ed quietly enough:
for Mrs. Thorold, &s;ure of being delivered
from a vi&s;itor who had never been agree|able
and was now unea&s;y to her, thought
it as well to be tolerably civil to her; and
Arabella, who thought very little about
any thing at pre&s;ent but &s;ecuring her con|que&s;t
over the heart of Mr. Betten&s;on, was
hardly con&s;cious that &s;he was with them.</P>
<P>Late in the evening the gentlemen re|turned;
but Cele&s;tina had left the parlour
before their arrival, on pretence of going
early to bed that &s;he might be ready the
next day for Mr. Cathcart, whom &s;he had
appointed to meet her in a po&s;t chai&s;e at
&s;ix o'clock. She took leave of Mrs. Tho|rold
and her daughter therefore this even|ing,
who received her thanks and adieus
with great formality and no kindne&s;s.
Very willingly would &s;he have e&s;caped
bidding farewel to Montague Thorold the
next morning, but &s;he feared it would be
impo&s;&s;ible: Mr. Thorold had told her he
&s;hould him&s;elf put her into the chai&s;e;
<PB N="191" REF="193">
and he always ro&s;e &s;o early, that this, &s;he
knew, would not put him out of his way.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as her window was opened in
the morning, which was almo&s;t as &s;oon as
it was light, &s;he &s;aw Montague Thorold
&s;tanding under it. He ki&s;&s;ed his hand to
her when he perceived her, and looked &s;o
dejected that &s;he could not &s;ee him without
concern. She was very &s;oon dre&s;&s;ed, and
went down into the parlour, where he no
&s;ooner &s;aw her than he came to her.&mdash;"You
are ready even before the time, &s;o
impatient are you to leave us," &s;aid he in
a mournful voice. "Ah! Mi&s;s De Mor|nay!
this hou&s;e then will never again be
ble&s;t with your pre&s;ence!"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir, I hope to &s;ee it very fre|quently
again, and &s;hall always be happy
to hear of the health and welfare of it's in|habitants.
But is your father in his &s;tudy?
I mu&s;t &s;ee him before I go."</P>
<P>"Do not, Cele&s;tina," &s;aid Montague
very gravely&mdash;"do not &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly try
to deprive me of this la&s;t poor moment.
<PB N="192" REF="194">
Yet a little&mdash;and my unfortunate, my de|&s;pi&s;ed
attachment will trouble you no more."</P>
<P>"You are mi&s;taken, Mr. Montague,"
replied Cele&s;tina. "Any circum&s;tance
that <HI>you</HI> have occa&s;ion to deem unfortu|nate
will trouble <HI>me</HI> long, wherever and
whatever I may be: pray therefore, for
my &s;ake as well as for your own, exert
your excellent under&s;tanding, and con|quer
this unlucky partiality towards a per|&s;on,
who, whatever may be her &s;en&s;e of
your worth, or her gratitude for your good
opinion, can never return it otherwi&s;e than
by e&s;teem and good wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>"I had rather you would hate, dete&s;t,
and drive me from you," cried he, &s;tarting
up and going to the window: "'twould
be le&s;s cruel than this gentle rea&s;on, which
I know to be ju&s;t, but which I cannot
obey: and yet indeed, Cele&s;tina, I have
no hope: I am not quite frantic enough
to &s;uppo&s;e there can be any for me. All
I a&s;k is to be permitted to be mi&s;erable,
and that, after all, you cannot prevent.
<PB N="193" REF="195">
Yes, there is yet another favour I would &s;o|licit,
though I know&mdash;I know you will not
grant it."</P>
<P>"Any thing I can do without impro|priety,"
replied Cele&s;tina, "I certainly will
do."</P>
<P>"I do not know," &s;aid he, in a depre&s;&s;ed
and &s;olemn voice, "what <HI>you</HI> may call
propriety or impropriety; but the favour I
would &s;olicit is to be allowed to write to
you.&mdash;Nay don't interrupt me with a re|fu&s;al
before you hear me&mdash;to be allowed
to write to you, &s;o long as I confine my
letters to literary &s;ubjects only, and that
once or twice a year you would acknow|ledge
the receipt of my letters."</P>
<P>"My dear Sir," cried &s;he, &s;miling,
"you would be weary of this project long
before the fir&s;t half year had elap&s;ed.
Had you never talked to me of I know not
what particular regard, there might have
been no impropriety in this, and I am
&s;ure the plea&s;ure and advantage would have
been wholly mine; but after the extrava|gantly
<PB N="194" REF="196">
gallant things you have &s;aid, how
can I&mdash;"</P>
<P>"If I infringe the articles of our agree|ment,"
&s;aid he, "then &s;end my letters
back."</P>
<P>"But tell me," cried Cele&s;tina, inter|rupting
him in her turn, "tell me what
good can this po&s;&s;ibly do you?"</P>
<P>"Good!" replied he: "you are not
your&s;elf in&s;en&s;ible of a tender attachment
to Willoughby, and yet a&s;k what <HI>good</HI> it
can do to be admitted to write to a beloved
object. Good! why it will be the &s;oftener,
the &s;weetener of my exi&s;tence! While I am
writing to you, I &s;hall forget that I am
never to &s;ee you&mdash;I &s;hall forget every thing
but the plea&s;ure of knowing that you will
read what I am writing, that your hands
will unfold my letter, your eyes pa&s;s over
the traces of my pen; that &s;ometimes I
may amu&s;e or intere&s;t you, and at others,
perhaps, rai&s;e in your bo&s;om a compa&s;&s;ion|ate

<P>Cele&s;tina had no time to an&s;wer this
otherwi&s;e than by &s;aying, that if he had
&s;agacity enough to find out where &s;he was
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more than &s;he did, who could
not even gue&s;s where &s;he might be. He
an&s;wered that he could always know of
Cathcart; and before &s;he could urge the
many objections &s;he &s;aw to his reque&s;t,
the chai&s;e, with Cathcart in it, drove up
to the door, and at the &s;ame moment Mr.
Thorold came to them. He appeared &s;in|cerely
concerned that &s;he was going from
him; de&s;ired her again to write to him;
<PB N="196" REF="198">
and while he was ha&s;tening breakfa&s;t,
which he in&s;i&s;ted upon her taking before
&s;he went, Vava&s;our rode into the court
yard, and giving his hor&s;e to his &s;ervant,
came into the room al&s;o.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who knew that Cathcart had
informed him of her re&s;olution to go, had
felt &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e that he had not called
upon her the day before to expre&s;s his ap|probation,
and enquire how &s;he intended
to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf: but he was &s;o volatile
and incon&s;iderate, that &s;he thought it not
impo&s;&s;ible but that he might have forgot|ten
on Wedne&s;day what he &s;o vehemently
urged on Monday; and &s;he now rather
wi&s;hed he had, as &s;he &s;aw Mr. Thorold
was very little plea&s;ed either with his pre|&s;ent
vi&s;it, or the manner in which he ad|dre&s;&s;ed
her, without taking either of him or
his &s;on quite &s;o much notice as the laws of
civility required.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina had frequently remarked the
extreme inattention and di&s;regard, which,
as Vava&s;our felt, he never cho&s;e to take
<PB N="197" REF="199">
the trouble of concealing, for the opinions
of tho&s;e to whom he was indifferent; and
he was indifferent to three fifths of the
world, and not very &s;olicitous about the
re&s;t, unle&s;s for a few, a very few friends,
whom he loved. He di&s;liked the Tho|rolds,
without knowing or enquiring of
him&s;elf why he di&s;liked them; and eager
and &s;olicitous only about Cele&s;tina, he
hardly gave her time to addre&s;s her&s;elf to
them, or returned their invitation to par|take
of their breakfa&s;t by the u&s;ual &s;peech.
A party who &s;eemed &s;o little plea&s;ed with
each other, Cele&s;tina thought could not
too &s;oon &s;eparate: &s;he therefore ha&s;tily
drank her tea, and telling Cathcart &s;he
was ready, &s;he gave the elder Mr. Thorold
her hand, and thanked him, not without
emotion, for all the kindne&s;s he had &s;hewn
her: &s;he then wi&s;hed Montague Thorold
health and happine&s;s, de&s;ired him to offer
her compliments and acknowledgments to
his mother, &s;i&s;ter, and brother, and then
Mr. Thorold leading her, and Montague
<PB N="198" REF="200">
walking &s;ilently on her left hand, &s;he went
out and &s;tepped into the chai&s;e.</P>
<P>Cathcart followed her, and Vava&s;our
went round to &s;peak to her at the oppo&s;ite
&s;ide. "You did not wi&s;h me good mor|row,"
&s;aid he, "and therefore I &s;uppo&s;e
you fore&s;ee that I intend going with you
part of the way."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina had no time to an&s;wer; for
Mr. Thorold offering his hand once more
to bid her adieu, &s;he gave it him, &s;aying&mdash;"Adieu!
dear Sir; a thou&s;and and a
thou&s;and thanks and good wi&s;hes." Mon|tague,
who &s;tood by his father, at that mo|ment
caught her eye, and there was on
his countenance an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;orrow
which affected her &s;o much, that under
the &s;udden impul&s;e of concern and pity
&s;he held out to him the hand his father let
go.&mdash;"Farewel, Mr. Montague," &s;aid
&s;he. He &s;eized it eagerly, and held it as
if he would never part from it more:
but Cathcart at that moment bowing to the
gentlemen and bidding the po&s;tillion drive
<PB N="199" REF="201">
on, he was compelled to relea&s;e it, though
it was with a &s;igh as if his heart was half
broken; and when the chai&s;e drove off,
in&s;tead of following it with his eyes, he
turned away and went into his own room,
unable either to &s;ee Cele&s;tina go or Vava|&s;our
following her.</P>
<P>The concern &s;he felt for him kept her
&s;ilent the greate&s;t part of the way to the
cottage near old Winnington's, where
Je&s;&s;y was to meet them. Cathcart, who
was unhappy at the nece&s;&s;ity of parting
from his wife, was not di&s;po&s;ed to inter|rupt
her; and though Vava&s;our now and
then rode up to the door of the chai&s;e and
talked, &s;he was not in &s;pirits to an&s;wer
the gay nothings with which he addre&s;&s;ed
her. The meeting with Je&s;&s;y was more in
uni&s;on with her feelings. Je&s;&s;y threw her|&s;elf
into the arms of her benefactre&s;s, from
whom &s;he had been &s;o long divided, and
who &s;he now &s;aw only for a moment before
they were to be &s;eparated for a yet longer
time. Neither of them could &s;ay much,
<PB N="200" REF="202">
for their hearts were full: but had they
been di&s;po&s;ed for conver&s;ation, Vava&s;our,
who felt only plea&s;ure in having got Ce|le&s;tina
away from the Thorolds, was very
little inclined to give them an opportunity:
but in his rattling way rallied Je&s;&s;y, and
then Cele&s;tina, whom he teazed about
Montague Thorold and his father, one of
whom he called her pedant and the other
her prie&s;t, till &s;he was half angry. Cath|cart
at length, however, prevailed upon
him to leave the friends alone; and as
they walked together before the door of
the cottage, he enquired whether he had
any commands in London. "Oh none,
I thank you," replied Vava&s;our, "for I
&s;hall be there my&s;elf almo&s;t as &s;oon as you.
Pray where does Mi&s;s De Mornay intend
to lodge?"</P>
<P>Cathcart declared him&s;elf entirely ig|norant;
and then, for the fir&s;t time, from
&s;ome expre&s;&s;ion or look of Vava&s;our's, he
&s;uddenly entertained a notion that there
was &s;omething more than friendly &s;olici|tude
<PB N="201" REF="203">
for Willoughby's betrothed wife in
the eager and a&s;&s;iduous attentions of Va|va&s;our;
and he determined from that time
to remark more narrowly his behaviour to
her.</P>
<P>"You do not intend to &s;et out for Lon|don
to-day, Sir?" enquired Cathcart.</P>
<P>"Yes I do," an&s;wered Vava&s;our: "that
is, I ju&s;t ride back and make my bow to
tho&s;e hone&s;t humdrum Cranfields, and
then I am off for Oakhampton, where I've
told them I have bu&s;ine&s;s, and from thence
I &s;hall take four hor&s;es, and &s;o come up
with you, my good fellow, and your fair
<HI>compagnon du voyage,</HI> before you reach Ho|niton."</P>
<P>"And does Mi&s;s De Mornay know of
your intentions, Sir?"</P>
<P>"No; for I know what &s;calping &s;avages
all the people about here are; and though
there can be nothing you know in my
attending her on behalf of Willoughby,
yet on her account one would not &s;et the
clacks of the old cats within twenty miles
<PB N="202" REF="204">
round at work about it, and &s;o I have
made up a &s;tory of having a lawyer to meet
about the affairs of my decea&s;ed aunt, who,
luckily for the honour of my veracity, had
a farm or two near Oakhampton, which
are now mine; and I intend the Cranfields,
good matter of fact &s;ouls, &s;hall fancy me
carefully looking after my property and &s;et|tling
repairs and renewals with Mr. Palmer
the attorney."</P>
<P>"You intend, no doubt, to tell Mi&s;s
De Mornay of it, however, Sir?"</P>
<P>"Oh! yes, now I &s;ee her &s;afely out of
the hands of her confe&s;&s;or, or el&s;e perhaps
he would have put it into her head that I
am not a fit e&s;cort for her; though I think,
Cathcart, thou art &s;o grave and &s;age that
thou'lt make as proper a third to our party
as his reverence him&s;elf. Come never look
&s;o calamitous, but go and take leave of thy
weeping wife, and let me and Cele&s;tina
have a little conver&s;ation."</P>
<P>Cathcart then went into the hou&s;e, and
Cele&s;tina pre&s;ently afterwards came to Va|va&s;our,
<PB N="203" REF="205">
who continued walking before it.
"Has Cathcart told you my plan?" &s;aid
he, before &s;he could &s;peak. "I intend to
go to London with you from Honiton,
where I &s;hall be almo&s;t as &s;oon as you."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina now recollected all Mr. Tho|rold
had &s;aid to her; but the great friend|&s;hip
which had for &s;o many years &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
between Vava&s;our and Willoughby, and
the unde&s;igning openne&s;s of Vava&s;our's cha|racter,
put all the &s;u&s;picions he had rai&s;ed
to flight, even when this &s;cheme &s;eemed
mo&s;t &s;trongly to corroborate tho&s;e &s;u&s;pi|cions.
"I had much rather you would
not join us," &s;aid Cele&s;tina, "becau&s;e,
though I &s;hould certainly be glad of your
company as well as Mr. Cathcart, yet per|haps
a thou&s;and ill natured things may be
&s;aid about it."</P>
<P>She was proceeding, when Vava&s;our in|terrupted
her. "Yes, that's ju&s;t the poli|tics
you have learned at the Thorolds.
What does it &s;ignify to you what any body
&s;ays or thinks but Willoughby, and you
<PB N="204" REF="206">
know that he would put you him&s;elf into
my protection on every occa&s;ion where he
could not protect you him&s;elf. Come, come,
Cele&s;tina, acknowledge that your old Men|tor
has been warning you again&s;t having
any acquaintance with &s;uch &s;ad young rakes
as Vava&s;our."</P>
<P>"If you think &s;o," replied Cele&s;tina,
"you undoubtedly know that he has rea|&s;on
for his precaution; and as for his calling
you what I always fancied you rather piqued
your&s;elf upon being, I don't &s;ee why my
Mentor, as you term him, &s;hould give you
offence by that."</P>
<P>"Rake as I am, however," an&s;wered
he, "cur&s;e me if I would do a di&s;honour|able
thing towards George. No, by hea|ven,
not if I were dying for love of you."</P>
<P>"I believe you indeed," &s;aid Cele&s;tina;
"and &s;uch perfect confidence I have in
your honour, that I &s;hould tru&s;t my&s;elf with
you as with a brother."</P>
<P>"And never, you dear candid angel,"
interrupted he, "never &s;hall you repent
<PB N="205" REF="207">
that confidence. But I tell you very plainly,
that though I am upon honour with Wil|loughby
I am not &s;o with tho&s;e Thorolds,
and can allow nobody el&s;e to u&s;urp that fa|vour,
which perhaps I might have taken it
into my head to di&s;pute even with my friend
George him&s;elf if he had not made out a
very early and almo&s;t an hereditary claim
to you: as it is, however, I have no pre|ten&s;ions
for my&s;elf, but I am confoundedly
jealous for him; and now I have got you
out of the way of that prating, piping,
poetical pedant&mdash;that Montague Thorold,
I &s;hall be quite ea&s;y when I &s;ee you &s;ituated
where you are not very likely to meet with
him again: &s;o you won't oppo&s;e my
meeting you on the road; and, till then,
my &s;weet friend, adieu!" He then, with|out
waiting for an an&s;wer, ran to his hor&s;e,
which his &s;ervant was leading about, and
mounting it, was out of &s;ight in an in&s;tant.
Cathcart and Je&s;&s;y then came towards Ce|le&s;tina;
and the latter hanging on her neck,
could hardly prevail on her&s;elf to bid her
<PB N="206" REF="208">
farewel; while Cele&s;tina, melting into
tears, ki&s;&s;ed her, and willing to &s;horten a
&s;cene &s;o u&s;ele&s;sly painful, &s;tepped into the
chai&s;e, where Cathcart, having taken again
a tender leave of his wife, immediately fol|lowed
her, and they took the road that led
acro&s;s the commons to the turnpike.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="207" REF="209">
<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>THE road they were travelling led
along the &s;ide of Alve&s;tone Park for near a
mile and a half. Cele&s;tina had never
pa&s;&s;ed it before, but on the day when Mr.
Thorold had taken her to his hou&s;e; and
then &s;he had been &s;o lo&s;t in mournful con|templations
as hardly to notice whither &s;he
went. Now, however, the profound &s;i|lence
&s;he had fallen into on parting from
Je&s;&s;y, was &s;uddenly broken by an excla|mation;
for on looking up, &s;he &s;aw one
of the park gates, and cried&mdash;"Alve&s;tone!
is it not?&mdash;oh! yes, I &s;ee it is: there is the
hou&s;e!" Cathcart an&s;wered that it was;
and after another &s;hort &s;ilence, Cele&s;tina
&s;aid&mdash;"To any body but you, Cathcart,
I &s;hould be afraid of betraying my weak|ne&s;s;
<PB N="208" REF="210">
but you are now in place of a bro|ther
to me, and knowing my &s;ituation, will
indulge my regret: I have a &s;trange fancy
to get out and go up to that tuft of beech
trees on the brow of the hill. It is not far.
I &s;hall not be gone long. Will you wait
for me?"</P>
<P>"My time is your's," replied he. "But
will you allow me to ob&s;erve that it is per|haps
wi&s;er to endeavour to conquer this
u&s;ele&s;s regret than to indulge it?"</P>
<P>"I know it would be wi&s;er," an&s;wered
Cele&s;tina: "but alas! we are not always
able to be wi&s;e. I think I &s;hall be ea&s;ier
when I have once more taken, of that &s;pot
where I have often been &s;o happy&mdash;a la&s;t
adieu!"</P>
<P>"Heaven forbid it &s;hould be the la&s;t,"
cried Cathcart, as he a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to leave
the chai&s;e. "I fore&s;ee many, many happy
days for you yet, when you will be mi&s;tre&s;s
of that hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Ah! dear Cathcart," returned Cele&s;|tina,
half &s;miling through the tears that
<PB N="209" REF="211">
filled her eyes, "how happy a convert
&s;hall I be to the doctrine of &s;econd &s;ight if
your prophecy &s;hould ever be fulfilled.
But no; I feel too certainly that this is the
la&s;t time I &s;hall ever behold this dear place."</P>
<P>She then went into the park over the
&s;tepping &s;tile, and walking about half a
quarter of a mile, reached the group of
beech trees which &s;haded a high knoll in
the park; from whence the hou&s;e, half
concealed by intervening wood, appeared
to great advantage. It was now the be|ginning
of May, and the trees under which
&s;he &s;tood were ju&s;t coming into leaf, while
others &s;cattered over the park were many
of them of the mo&s;t vivid green, contra&s;ted
by the darker &s;hade of fir and cypre&s;s min|gled
among them. One of the trees of
this clump was marked by Willoughby
with her name, his own, and his &s;i&s;ter's,
and the date. It was five years &s;ince; and
the bark had grown rough and knotted
round the &s;cars, but the letters &s;till re|mained.
It was to re-vi&s;it this well known
<PB N="210" REF="212">
memorial that Cele&s;tina had been anxious;
and now &s;he could hardly bear the thoughts
of leaving it. She recollected every trifling
circum&s;tance that happened when Wil|loughby
cut tho&s;e letters: the cloaths he
wore, and his very look, were again pre|&s;ent
to her; while in the breeze that
&s;ighed among the trees &s;he fancied &s;he
heard the &s;ound of his voice, and that he
pronounced the name of Cele&s;tina. In
this &s;tate of mind &s;he had almo&s;t forgotten
that Cathcart waited for her; till a herd
of deer ran bounding by her, and looking
up, &s;he &s;aw following them in mimic race,
&s;everal hor&s;es which grazed in the park.
There was among them a favourite little
mare, which Willoughby had been fond of
from a boy: it had always carried him to
Eton, and been the companion of all his
boyi&s;h &s;ports; and when it became old,
had been turned into the park in &s;ummer
and carefully &s;heltered in winter. While
Mrs. Willoughby lived, it had been ac|cu&s;tomed
to be fed with bread once or
<PB N="211" REF="213">
twice a day from her hand, from her daugh|ter's,
or Cele&s;tina's; and &s;ince her death
the old &s;ervants in the hou&s;e, with whom
it was a &s;ort of cotemporary, had accu&s;|tomed
it to the &s;ame indulgence; to which
it had become &s;o habituated, that on &s;ight
of any of the family it went towards them
to be fed. This creature therefore no
&s;ooner &s;aw Cele&s;tina's cloaths fluttering
among the trees, than it left it's compa|nions,
and came neighing towards her.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina fancied the animal remembered
her. She care&s;&s;ed it fondly, and with tears
in her eyes, and a deep &s;igh, cried&mdash;"Ah!
Fanchette, you recollect then your old
friend, when perhaps your &s;till beloved
ma&s;ter is trying to forget her, and may al|ready
have &s;ucceeded but too well." She
found her&s;elf too much affected with this
idea, and turning her &s;wimming eyes to|wards
the hou&s;e, the contra&s;t between
what &s;he now was, and what, hardly a
month &s;ince, &s;he expected to be&mdash;the fear|ful
apprehen&s;ion that Willoughby had &s;ud|denly
<PB N="212" REF="214">
become a convert to avarice and
ambition, and that Mi&s;s Fitz-Hayman,
who had the power to gratify both tho&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions, would &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;s the place
where &s;he had fondly hoped to con&s;titute
the happine&s;s of <HI>his</HI> life who&s;e happine&s;s
was dearer to her than her own&mdash;all
crouded with cruel force on her mind; and
feeling her &s;en&s;ations become more and
more painful, &s;he tore her&s;elf from the
&s;pot which had &s;o forcibly pre&s;ented them,
Fanchette &s;till following, and importuning
her to be fed. She walked &s;lowly towards
the park gate, and &s;aw Cathcart, who be|gan
to be unea&s;y at her &s;tay, coming to
meet her. He under&s;tood the nature of
her &s;en&s;ations too well to make any en|quiries;
but offering her his arm, in &s;ilence
led her towards the chai&s;e. Before &s;he
a&s;cended the &s;teps of the &s;tile, &s;he turned
once more to look at the hor&s;e; ki&s;&s;ed the
&s;en&s;ible animal as it licked her hands; and
pronouncing a half &s;tifled and tremulous
"adieu Fanchette!" &s;he got as ha&s;tily as
<PB N="213" REF="215">
&s;he could into the chai&s;e, and de&s;ired
Cathcart to order the po&s;tillion on quickly.
"Since I mu&s;t go," &s;aid &s;he, "I would
be &s;oon out of &s;ight of this place, for I
find I cannot bear it."</P>
<P>"I feared indeed," replied Cathcart,
"it would too much affect you."</P>
<P>Both then returned to their former &s;ilence;
while Cele&s;tina, as her thoughts went back
to pa&s;t plea&s;ures, and as her heart felt all
the bitterne&s;s of di&s;appointed hope, in|dulged
her&s;elf without re&s;traint in the &s;ad
luxury of &s;orrow. She no longer &s;aw the
objects &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, or thought of whither
&s;he was going: but Alve&s;tone was &s;till
pre&s;ent to her eyes, and &s;he &s;aw Willoughby
wandering among it's &s;hades as if looking
for lo&s;t happine&s;s, and returning di&s;con|tented
to his hou&s;e; whence the &s;ullen
magnificence and arrogant &s;uperiority of
his haughty heire&s;s had driven all dome&s;tic
comfort. She heard him &s;igh forth too late
his regret, and lament that for advantages
he could not enjoy, he had relinqui&s;hed the
<PB N="214" REF="216">
competence he might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, with
the tender attachment and grateful affection
of his Cele&s;tina. Tears fell &s;lowly down

This di&s;po&s;ition of mind, mournful as
it was, afforded Cele&s;tina &s;o much me|lancholy
indulgence, that it was very re|luctantly
&s;he was rou&s;ed from it by their
reaching Honiton; where &s;he was glad to
find Vava&s;our not yet arrived: for though
&s;he was &s;en&s;ible of the friendly intere&s;t he
took in whatever related to her, and im|puted
it to no other motive than regard
for Willoughby, and pity for her own &s;itu|ation,
there was an impetuo&s;ity in his
manner, and a freedom in his di&s;cour&s;e,
which, though it did not offend her becau&s;e
&s;he knew it was his u&s;ual way with every
body, was yet often oppre&s;&s;ive to her, and
&s;ince Mr. Thorold's caution, had become
more &s;o than before. She ob&s;erved too,
that Cathcart was not plea&s;ed at his purpo&s;e
of accompanying them to London, and
had expre&s;&s;ed more than once, in the little
conver&s;ation they had together during their
journey, his hope, that &s;he would find his
&s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, &s;uch a companion
as might engage her to continue with her.&mdash;
<PB N="216" REF="218">
Cele&s;tina, who was, perhaps, a little too
fa&s;tidious in the choice of her company,
from having in her early years had her
ta&s;te &s;et very high by Mrs. Willoughby,
was become generally indifferent now, from
the little expectation &s;he formed of being
gratified, and though her overcharged
heart langui&s;hed for the &s;oothing plea&s;ure
of unburthening it&s;elf to &s;uch a friend as the
&s;imple and &s;en&s;ible Je&s;&s;y, &s;he knew it was
very improbable that any one whom &s;he
might meet &s;hould replace her. She an|&s;wered
Cathcart, however, that &s;he doubted
not Mrs. Elphin&s;tone's merit, &s;ince &s;he was
his &s;i&s;ter, and was greatly prejudiced in her
favour by Je&s;&s;y's account of her. "But,
my dear Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "it is I who have
the greate&s;t rea&s;on to doubt of my recep|tion,
and I have thought &s;ince, the plan
we ha&s;tily formed a very wild one. Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone, occupied by her family, may
have as little occa&s;ion for a companion as
ta&s;te for an intruder into her dome&s;tic cir|cle;
and &s;he may perhaps, on your recom|mendation,
<PB N="217" REF="219">
accept, what her own inclina|tion
may be aver&s;e to receive. Be&s;ides &s;he
has a hu&s;band, of whom I know nothing,
and to whom the pre&s;ence of a &s;tranger,
when he expects only his wife and family,
may be di&s;agreeable. I own I have thought
of a journey into the North with more plea|&s;ure
than any thing el&s;e can now give me,
for it is the only part of this i&s;land I have
not &s;een &s;omething of, in tho&s;e &s;ummer
excur&s;ions which my dear Mrs. Willoughby
was fond of making. But with whatever
&s;atisfaction my fancy has dwelt upon it, I
ought not to think of it farther, at lea&s;t till
I have &s;een your &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>Cathcart repeated again and again his
a&s;&s;urances of the happine&s;s her company
would be&s;tow on his &s;i&s;ter, and continued
to lay plans for the accommodation of their
journey: while Cele&s;tina could not but
think with internal angui&s;h on her very
forlorn &s;ituation, compelled to &s;olicit the
friend&s;hip and protection of &s;trangers, or
remain alone, unfriended and unprotected.
<PB N="218" REF="220">
She ble&s;t, however, again the fortunate
chance that had brought her acquainted
with Je&s;&s;y and Cathcart, without whom her
condition would be yet more de&s;olate; and
for once &s;aw evidently the la&s;ting good that
had been produced by a tran&s;ient evil, the
trouble&s;ome impertinence of Mr. Jedwyn.</P>
<P>As they arrived at Honiton &s;ooner than
they expected, Cele&s;tina propo&s;ed going
on as far as Axmin&s;ter, nine miles farther,
before they dined. To this Cathcart con|&s;ented;
he&s;itating however a moment whe|ther
they ought not to wait for Vava&s;our.
Cele&s;tina &s;eemed aver&s;e to it, and &s;aid if
there was any rudene&s;s in their going on
without him, &s;he would her&s;elf be an&s;wera|ble
for it.</P>
<P>They proceeded therefore to Axmin|&s;ter,
and were ju&s;t &s;et down to their dinner,
when Vava&s;our, at the expence of almo&s;t
killing the four hor&s;es which drew him, ar|rived.</P>
<P>His volatile humour never for&s;ook him,
and he &s;eemed now unu&s;ually di&s;po&s;ed to
<PB N="219" REF="221">
indulge it. He gave the mo&s;t ludicrous
account of the manner in which he had
mi&s;led the curio&s;ity of Mrs. Cranfield, by
&s;etting out very gravely for Oakhampton;
and then cried&mdash;"Oh! and I tell you
who I met as I rode back to Cranfield's;
your langui&s;hing lover, Montague Tho|rold,
looking, poor dog! &s;o di&s;tanced and
&s;o di&s;mal: he was compo&s;ing, I fancy, an
elegy on your departure, for I rode almo&s;t
again&s;t him in the cro&s;s lane that leads
from old Thorold's grounds towards Cran|field
Hall, and he had a paper in his hand,
on which he was &s;o intent that he did not
&s;ee me, till I awakened him with a ho hoop!
ho hoop! as if I had been in at the death.
He &s;tarted, and I was afraid, as I might
have &s;poiled a thought, that he would feel
&s;ome poetical indignation; but in&s;tead of
that, he popped the paper into his bo&s;om,
as if he feared I &s;hould have &s;eized it;
and then, with as much humility as if I
had been the head of his college, he
pulled off his hat, and profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf
<PB N="220" REF="222">
glad to &s;ee me, enquired where I had left
you: I told him on your way to London,
and that I was going back to Cranfield's;
and we parted with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s."</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina, who had really a friend&s;hip
for Montague Thorold, could not hear of
his anxious &s;olicitude for her, without a
mingled &s;entiment of regard and concern,
which, as her face expre&s;&s;ed every emotion
of her heart, was immediately perceived by
the quick and penetrating eyes of Vava&s;our.
He did not &s;pare her; but rallied her with
more &s;ucce&s;s than politene&s;s on the influ|ence
this college lad, for &s;o he cho&s;e to
term him, had obtained over her. "Upon
my word," &s;aid he, "I &s;hall think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to put Willoughby upon his guard
a little."</P>
<P>"And how do you know, Sir," an|&s;wered
Cele&s;tina, "that Mr. Willoughby
will thank you for it? or, that admitting
Mr. Montague Thorold was really more to
me than a common acquaintance, which
you do not &s;eriou&s;ly believe, how are you
<PB N="221" REF="223">
&s;ure that your friend would not be rather
plea&s;ed, that the affections he may wi&s;h to
be troubled with no more, are transferred
to another?"</P>
<P>"Transferred!" exclaimed Vava&s;our.
"You admit then that &s;uch a transfer is
probable?"</P>
<P>"Not probable at all: but certainly it
would with mo&s;t people be po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"And if it were with you, I am con|vinced
that Montague Thorold is not the
man to whom Willoughby would wi&s;h them
to be transferred."</P>
<P>"He could, however, have very little
pretence, after having re&s;igned them him|&s;elf,
to dictate to whom they &s;hould be
given. But of what u&s;e, Mr. Vava&s;our, is
all this argument? Whether I &s;hall ever
&s;ee Willoughby again or no is very uncer|tain:
but it is very certain that if I do not,
I &s;hall never marry at all."</P>
<P>Vava&s;our &s;aw he had gone too far; and
Cathcart at that moment returning to them
to &s;ay the chai&s;es were ready, the conver|&s;ation
<PB N="222" REF="224">
dropped for that time; Cele&s;tina pe|remptorily
re&s;i&s;ting the efforts Vava&s;our
made to induce her to go at lea&s;t the next
&s;tage, in the chai&s;e with him.</P>
<P>They reached Dorche&s;ter that evening;
and Cele&s;tina, after a &s;light &s;upper, com|plained
of being a good deal fatigued with
her journey, and going as &s;oon as &s;he could
to her chamber, left the two gentlemen to|gether.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our, naturally unre&s;erved, even to
indi&s;cretion, and &s;eldom taking the trouble
to conceal his &s;entiments, was totally off
his guard when he had drank five or &s;ix
gla&s;&s;es of wine; and &s;ince Willoughby,
who alone had the power to re&s;train any of
his exce&s;&s;es, had been le&s;s with him, he
had accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to take more than
double that quantity when he either dined
or &s;upped. Cele&s;tina was no &s;ooner gone
therefore, than he ordered in another bot|tle
of claret, and before it was fini&s;hed, he
had told Cathcart without re&s;erve all that
he thought. Taking occa&s;ion to toa&s;t
<PB N="223" REF="225">
Cele&s;tina, he &s;aid&mdash;"Tell me, Frank!
what do you think of her? Is &s;he not a
charming girl?"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t undoubtedly," replied Cathcart,
&s;he appears &s;o to me, who know that her
very lovely per&s;on is the lea&s;t of her merit;
to me, who owe her more than life, and
who throughout mine &s;hall have rea&s;on to
ble&s;s the hour that fir&s;t threw my Je&s;&s;y in
her way."</P>
<P>"Yes, by heaven," cried Vava&s;our, "&s;he
is an angel, and I cannot for my &s;oul gue&s;s
at this &s;trange my&s;terious bu&s;ine&s;s of
George's leaving her: for though it is a
de&s;perate undertaking for a man to marry
at all, yet he had got over that, and doated
upon her to a degree that I never imagined
po&s;&s;ible till I &s;aw them together. I cannot
under&s;tand it; and the more I think about
it, the more incomprehen&s;ible it becomes.
Tell me, Cathcart, do you think he will
now ever marry her?"</P>
<P>"My dear Sir," replied Cathcart, "I
<PB N="224" REF="226">
can only &s;ay with you, that the more I
think, the le&s;s I comprehend of the affair."</P>
<P>"I'll tell you, Frank: I am pretty well
per&s;uaded that he never will marry her;
nay, that he has made up his mind to tie
him&s;elf to the fifteen thou&s;and a year, and
the Vi&s;count's title, which are the appen|dages
of his cou&s;in: yet why, unle&s;s he
had fully determined again&s;t all the temp|tations
that match offered him&mdash;why carry
matters &s;o far with Cele&s;tina? and who the
devil could tho&s;e two women be who it
&s;eems put the matter by and &s;ent him off
in &s;uch a hurry?"</P>
<P>"I never could find out," replied Cath|cart.
"He was him&s;elf the only per&s;on
who knew, and of him, as he avoided all
explanation, I could not enquire."</P>
<P>"What! did you never a&s;k whether
they were young or old?"</P>
<P>"I a&s;ked; but the people hardly &s;aw
their faces. They came in the evening,
and went away in the middle of the night;
<PB N="225" REF="227">
but from the little information I could
make out, neither of them appeared young."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould have thought, (for you fel|lows
that affect principle are not always to
be depended upon,) that George had got
into &s;ome filly &s;crape or other with &s;ome
wench that he might have promi&s;ed to
marry: but any &s;uch entanglement might
have been ea&s;ily got rid of, without his
flying away from Cele&s;tina or even from
his country. Well! there is no making
it out: but I believe it is clear enough that
Cele&s;tina will now never be <HI>his</HI> wife, and
that being once a&s;certained, Cathcart, do
you know &s;he is the only woman upon
earth whom I &s;hall ever think of making
mine?"</P>
<P>"Your's Sir!" exclaimed Cathcart.</P>
<P>"Aye, mine, Sir. I own 'tis rather ex|traordinary
that even my divine Cele&s;tina
&s;hould make <HI>me</HI> meditate on matrimony;
but &s;uch a wonder was worthy of her only,
and &s;he has effected it. I never was un|ea&s;y
half an hour in my life about any
<PB N="226" REF="228">
woman till I &s;aw her at Alve&s;tone, or ra|ther
till I became acquainted with her; for
I have &s;een perhaps hand&s;omer women, or
at lea&s;t tho&s;e that were at fir&s;t view more
&s;triking. Faith I found my&s;elf growing &s;o
cur&s;ed fooli&s;h about her, that &s;uppo&s;ing
her then to be on the eve of marriage with
my friend George, I thought it be&s;t to fly
for it, and by going back to my old
haunts&mdash;you know my way&mdash;I got her out
of my head a little, and could have &s;een
her Willoughby's wife coolly enough; but
the moment I heard he had left her, this
confounded love, I &s;uppo&s;e you call it,
began to play the devil with me again, and
I could not be ea&s;y, knowing the folks &s;he
was with, without coming down to &s;ee
after her. However Captain Thorold, (it
was that puffing fellow I was mo&s;t afraid
of,) had not, I believe, the lea&s;t intere&s;t."</P>
<P>"Nor will any man have it, I fancy,"
replied Cathcart: "at lea&s;t I am &s;ure that
nothing le&s;s than the certainty of Mr. Wil|loughby's
marriage with another, would
<PB N="227" REF="229">
for a moment detach her from the invaria|ble
affection &s;he has for him. I even que&s;|tion
if that would make any alteration in
her heart, though it might in her pro&s;|pects."</P>
<P>"Pooh, pooh," cried Vava&s;our, "you
have not &s;tudied women I find. Cele&s;tina
has too much &s;pirit and too much &s;en&s;e to
mope away her youth and beauty, and
dwindle into the neglected ugline&s;s of an|cient
maidenhood, becau&s;e Willoughby
did not know his own mind. Her pride,
and &s;he is not without it, will help her to
get the better of an attachment which will
only be a &s;ource of mortification to her.
No, no, let me be once &s;ure that Wil|loughby
gives her up, and I don't think
it very pre&s;umptuous to &s;ay, that in a fort|night
afterwards I carry her, to Ortney-bury,
Mrs. Vava&s;our."</P>
<P>"'Till then, however, Sir," &s;aid Cath|cart&mdash;"till
you are quite &s;ure that all is at
an end between Mr. Willoughby and Mi&s;s
De Mornay, you will of cour&s;e hold it a
<PB N="228" REF="230">
point of honour not to declare your in|tentions.
It will di&s;tre&s;s her extremely if
you do. For thinking of you as I know
&s;he thinks, &s;he will conclude you are very
certain that all ties are di&s;&s;olved between
them, or you would not addre&s;s her in a
way, which, while tho&s;e ties are undi&s;|&s;olved,
&s;he will call a breach of honour to|wards
your friend."</P>
<P>"Aye, that's all very true," replied
Vava&s;our. "But let her take care then
how &s;he &s;hews a di&s;po&s;ition to favour that
&s;ucking par&s;on&mdash;that Montague Thorold.
Though I'm willing to allow Willoughby
the preference, I am by no means di&s;po&s;ed
to give the pas to &s;uch a green horn as
that: and to tell you the truth, Frank, If
I were &s;ure &s;he preferred him I might
commit &s;ome d&mdash;d folly or other."</P>
<P>"Well, Sir," cried Cathcart, ri&s;ing to
wi&s;h him good night, "&s;he is not likely
to be in his way; and if &s;he were I am
very certain Mr. Willoughby has nothing
to fear from him; and as to your&s;elf you
<PB N="229" REF="231">
know, you agree, that while <HI>he</HI> is in que&s;tion
<HI>you</HI> are entirely out of it."</P>
<P>Cathcart then left him to fini&s;h another
bottle alone, and carried with him no very
agreeable reflections. Notwith&s;tanding all
that had pa&s;&s;ed he could not dive&s;t him&s;elf
of the hope of &s;eeing Cele&s;tina united to
Willoughby, whom alone he thought
worthy of her. His own competence and
happine&s;s, which they only had given him,
would, he felt, be incomplete if both or
either of them were unhappy; and un|happy
he thought they mu&s;t be if they
lived not for each other. Whatever
&s;cheme therefore interfered with a union he
&s;o much de&s;ired, he felt as a &s;ort of injury
to him&s;elf; and though the extreme good
humour, generous &s;pirit, and gay temper
of Vava&s;our, made it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;like
him, Cathcart was convinced, from the
little he knew of his manner of life and his
very free principles, that were Willoughby
wholly &s;et a&s;ide, he was a man with whom
the &s;en&s;ibility and purity of mind of Cele&s;|tina
<PB N="230" REF="232">
would never allow her to be happy:
he fore&s;aw, therefore, nothing but unea&s;i|ne&s;s
for her in his intended pur&s;uit of her,
and thought with redoubled anxiety of
her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>As early the following morning as Va|va&s;our
could be prevailed upon to move,
they renewed their journey; and about &s;ix
o'clock that evening, having taken leave
of Vava&s;our in Piccadilly, (who took Cath|cart's
directions, in order to be with them
the next morning,) Cele&s;tina was &s;et down
at the lodgings Mrs. Elphin&s;tone had re|moved
to in Suffolk-&s;treet, Charing Cro&s;s.</P>

<DIV1 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="231" REF="233">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>CATHCART had given his &s;i&s;ter no|tice
of the arrival of Cele&s;tina, and there|fore
the joy with which Mrs. Elphin&s;tone
received her brother and the lovely per&s;on
to whom he had been &s;o much obliged,
was unallayed by the &s;urpri&s;e &s;he might
have felt at the unexpected entrance of a
&s;tranger.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina was extremely plea&s;ed with her
new acquaintance, and very &s;oon forgot
that &s;he &s;aw her for the fir&s;t time. Her fi|gure
was very tall and thin, and would have
had as much dignity as &s;ymmetry but that
an habitual though &s;light &s;toop &s;eemed to
be&s;peak oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirit and the weight
of many &s;orrows. Her face very much
re&s;embled that of Cathcart; but the bloom
<PB N="232" REF="234">
of youth and the glow of health were gone:
&s;till it was intere&s;ting, though languid and
faded. Her eyes were eminently beauti|ful;
and there was an air of mild re&s;igna|tion
over her whole countenance particu|larly
touching, which, even in her mo&s;t
cheerful moments, be&s;poke her rather &s;tudy|ing
how to bear the evils &s;he &s;eemed to
fore&s;ee, than capable of enjoying the pa&s;&s;ing
plea&s;ure. Sorrow had left on her expre&s;|&s;ive
features marks of it's cruel power, and
had anticipated the hand of time: for
though &s;he was not yet thirty, &s;he appeared
four or five years older; and her dre&s;s of|fered
nothing to undeceive the imagination,
for it was &s;o plain that nothing but it's ex|treme
neatne&s;s and finer linen di&s;tingui&s;hed
her from women in the humble&s;t rank
of life. Her manners, however, would, in
any dre&s;s or any &s;ituation of life, have
marked her for a well educated woman;
and her voice was particularly plea&s;ing to
Cele&s;tina, who had been wearied by the
<PB N="233" REF="235">
har&s;h monotony of Mrs. Thorold or the
affected li&s;p of her daughter.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina had not been an hour in com|pany
with Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, before &s;he
not only determined on going to Scotland
with her if it were practicable, but felt &s;o
unea&s;y in the fear of a di&s;appointment that
&s;he wi&s;hed to have it immediately di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.
Cathcart, who ea&s;ily under&s;tood her, then
began to talk the matter over with his &s;i&s;ter,
and found, that from the hint of it which
he had before given her, &s;he had been a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly
removing every objection that
could ari&s;e. She an&s;wered for Mr. Elphin|&s;tone,
whom Cathcart had before de&s;cribed
to Cele&s;tina as good natured even to a fault,
and &s;o fond of &s;ociety as to have owed
great part of his misfortunes to a pa&s;&s;ion
for it; and Cele&s;tina, willing to be con|vinced
of what &s;he wi&s;hed to believe, no
longer he&s;itated. Nothing then remained
but to prepare for their departure, which
was fixed to be at the di&s;tance of two days.
Cathcart undertook every preparation; and
<PB N="234" REF="236">
having &s;ettled every thing as far as it could
be that evening, he took leave of Cele&s;tina,
for whom Mrs. Elphin&s;tone had procured
an apartment in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and went
to a coffee hou&s;e, where he had be&s;poke
a bed, promi&s;ing to be with them the next
morning.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina early on that morning aro&s;e
to write the letter &s;he had long meditated
to Willoughby. She was now able to give
&s;uch rea&s;ons for her quitting Mr. Thorold
as he could not di&s;approve; and though
he might perhaps think her pre&s;ent plan a
&s;trange one, he would be ea&s;y, &s;he thought,
in the reflection that it was attended with
no per&s;onal danger and that &s;he was with
Cathcart's &s;i&s;ter. One only objection now
&s;truck her, and that was the length of time
which mu&s;t elap&s;e before &s;he could re|ceive
his letters: but on the other hand, if
the &s;trange ob&s;tacles to their meeting re|mained,
it was uncertain whether he
would write to her; and if they were re|moved,
&s;he hoped that he would fly to her
<PB N="235" REF="237">
with equal eagerne&s;s whether &s;he was in
Devon&s;hire or in the extreme parts of
Scotland. She collected, therefore, every
thing her tenderne&s;s &s;ugge&s;ted to make
Willoughby ea&s;y about her if he &s;till loved
her, and was &s;hedding involuntary tears
over that painful doubt, when, as &s;he had
ju&s;t concluded her letter, Vava&s;our very
abruptly entered the dining room, where
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone had not yet taken her
&s;eat, being detained by the care of her four
children, whom &s;he attended to entirely
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Vava&s;our entered with the gay confi|dence
of a welcome vi&s;itor; but was a little
di&s;concerted by the languid coldne&s;s with
which Cele&s;tina received him, and by the
air of melancholy &s;he a&s;&s;umed, and the
traces of recent tears which he ob&s;erved on
her cheeks. He enquired if &s;he was not
writing to Willoughby; and on her an|&s;wering
"yes," a&s;ked her what &s;he had &s;aid
to him of her future intentions as to re&s;i|dence.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="238">
"I have told him," replied &s;he, "that
I am going to Scotland."</P>
<P>"To Scotland! impo&s;&s;ible! you are
laughing at me."</P>
<P>"Indeed I am going to Scotland," &s;aid
&s;he; "and I thought you had known it."</P>
<P>"To Scotland! No, I imagined you
would take lodgings either in London or
it's neighbourhood, and wait for letters
from George, which mu&s;t &s;oon be here and
be certainly deci&s;ive."</P>
<P>"That is by no means certain," an|&s;wered
Cele&s;tina; "and whatever the pur|port
of tho&s;e letters may be, I may hear it
there as well as here."</P>
<P>Vava&s;our now enquired more minutely
into her plan; again&s;t which he fir&s;t le|velled
his whole powers of ridicule, as be|ing
wild, romantic, unplea&s;ant, and pro|ductive
of nothing but di&s;appointment and
fatigue; but finding Cele&s;tina proof again&s;t
all the ludicrous lights in which he could
repre&s;ent it, he became &s;erious, and vehe|mently
inveighed again&s;t the folly and ha|zard
<PB N="237" REF="239">
of a journey to the mo&s;t de&s;olate and
dreary country of Britain, to re&s;ide with
people whom &s;he did not know, and who
were them&s;elves only adventurers on a wild
and &s;peculative &s;cheme that would proba|bly
be abortive. He repre&s;ented very
forcibly the di&s;comforts &s;he mu&s;t meet
with, and the little plea&s;ure or knowledge
which the view of &s;uch a country could
offer to counterbalance them: but &s;he was
as indifferent to local circum&s;tances as to
the ridicule of tho&s;e who would, he &s;aid,
laugh at her pilgrimage to the &s;hrine of
St. Columba; and he had exhau&s;ted al|mo&s;t
all his arguments without making any
alteration in her re&s;olution, when the en|trance
of Mrs. Elphin&s;tone and Cathcart
obliged him to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>From their conver&s;ation he had the mor|tification
of hearing that every thing would
be ready for their journey the next day but
one, and of finding that Cathcart never
&s;uppo&s;ed he meant to object to any plan of
Cele&s;tina's, who was entirely mi&s;tre&s;s of her
<PB N="238" REF="240">
actions. Unu&s;ed to any oppo&s;ition, Vava|&s;our
could hardly brook it, even from tho&s;e
who were his equals; and though he had
hitherto behaved to Cathcart as if he had
con&s;idered him as &s;uch, his &s;pirit now re|volted
at what he thought the oppo&s;ition of
an inferior and a dependant. He became
&s;ilent during breakfa&s;t, and was very evi|dently
di&s;plea&s;ed; and as &s;oon as he could
he de&s;ired Cathcart to walk with him for
half an hour in the Park. He there re|mon&s;trated
very warmly again&s;t Cele&s;tina's
going, and urged, among many other rea|&s;ons,
the objections Willoughby would
make to it. Cathcart, convinced from
this conver&s;ation that it was nece&s;&s;ary for
her to be removed as far as po&s;&s;ible from
Vava&s;our, kept his temper, and referred
his impetuous opponent to Cele&s;tina her|&s;elf.
He went back, therefore, to Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone's lodgings to make another
effort, but had the additional mortification
of finding the ladies gone out to make pur|cha&s;es,
and all his &s;ub&s;equent attempts that
<PB N="249" REF="241">
day to &s;ee them were abortive. The next, he
attended very early at their door, and &s;aw
a chai&s;e there, into which he found them
almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;tepping, to dine at Rich|mond
with an old relation of Mrs. El|phin&s;tone's and Cathcart's, of whom it
was nece&s;&s;ary for the former to take leave;
and all Vava&s;our's di&s;regard for forms could
not authori&s;e his intruding him&s;elf upon
them there. He called in the evening in
Suffolk-&s;treet, but they were not returned;
and was there again at ten o'clock, and
told they were gone to bed. At day
break the next morning he propo&s;ed to
be&s;et the door, though almo&s;t hopele&s;s now
of detaining Cele&s;tina. The habits of life,
however, he was accu&s;tomed to, and &s;ome
additional wine drank the evening before
to conquer his vexation; contributed to
keep him long after day break from being
on the watch; and on his arrival about &s;e|ven
o'clock, he learned from Cathcart,
who was ju&s;t &s;etting out for Devon&s;hire
with the two little girls and a &s;ervant he
<PB N="240" REF="242">
had hired to take care of them, that Ce|le&s;tina
and his &s;i&s;ter had been gone above
two hours, and were probably many miles
on the North road. Vava&s;our received this
intelligence with indignation and re&s;ent|ment,
which Cathcart pretended not to
ob&s;erve; and bu&s;ying him&s;elf in placing
his little girls in the chai&s;e and &s;ettling
their baggage, he in a few moments wi&s;hed
Vava&s;our a good morning, and left him to
cur&s;e his de&s;tiny at his lei&s;ure, which he did
very liberally for &s;ome moments; and
then determining to think no more of Ce|le&s;tina,
he plunged, in order to forget her,
into tho&s;e &s;cenes where he was certainly
not apprehen&s;ive of meeting any body like
her; and with a party he formed there, he
went in a few days to Ortney-bury, his &s;eat
in Stafford&s;hire, where he tried to per&s;uade
him&s;elf that he hated and de&s;pi&s;ed all mo|de&s;t
women, and never would give him&s;elf
a moment's concern about one of that de|&s;cription again.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="243">
Very differently did Montague Thorold
&s;u&s;tain the lo&s;s of Cele&s;tina's company,
and the cruel probability, amounting almo&s;t
he believed to a certainty, that he &s;hould
never &s;ee her again. While he remained
at his father's hou&s;e, which was hardly a
week after her quitting it, he fed his un|happy
love by collecting many little me|morials
of her, which he pre&s;erved as &s;a|cred
relics with all the fond idolatry of
romantic pa&s;&s;ion. A cambrick handker|chief
which &s;he had dropped, marked by
her own hands and with her own hair,
was one of the principal of the&s;e, and in it
he con&s;tantly kept folded up the &s;onnet,
written with a pencil, which he &s;teeped in
milk to pre&s;erve the letters from being
era&s;ed; a card on which &s;he had &s;ketched
a land&s;kape, and a profile which he at|tempted
to make of her one evening by
a &s;hade, though his trembling hand and
want of &s;kill had deprived it of much re|&s;emblance,
were added to the packet which
he thus wore in his bo&s;om, and which he
<PB N="242" REF="244">
&s;o delighted in contemplating, that he for|got
all other claims upon his time; and
regardle&s;s of what his family &s;aid or thought,
pa&s;&s;ed whole days alone in the fields, or
when he was with them, was re&s;erved, &s;ilent,
and re&s;tle&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold &s;aw all this with great con|cern,
but &s;till flattered him&s;elf that ab&s;ence,
and returning again to his &s;tudies and his
college friends, would in&s;en&s;ibly wean him
from the indulgence of a fruitle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion;
and &s;ometimes he entertained a vague and
di&s;tant hope that if Willoughby re&s;igned all
preten&s;ions to the hand of Cele&s;tina, the
merit and attachment of Montague might
have a claim to her gratitude and her affec|tion.
But of this he gave not the mo&s;t di&s;|tant
hint to his &s;on, and parted with him
without naming Cele&s;tina, or &s;eeming to
notice the &s;tate of his mind in regard to her.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina in the mean time was journey|ing
towards Scotland with Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone
and her two little boys. As Cathcart
had hired a chai&s;e to carry them to Edin|burgh,
<PB N="243" REF="245">
where Elphin&s;tone was to meet
them, they travelled &s;lowly; but as the
weather was delightful, and her companion
became every day more agreeable to her,
Cele&s;tina was in no ha&s;te to reach the end
of her journey. Every thing in this part
of England was new to her; and &s;ince the
fatal hour of her &s;eparation from Willough|by
&s;he had never been &s;o calm as &s;he now
felt her&s;elf, though far enough from being
happy. The oftener &s;he read over the let|ters
&s;he had received from Willoughby,
which were her con&s;tant companions, the
more &s;teadily &s;he reflected on his principles
and his character, more firmly &s;he became
per&s;uaded that whatever was the cau&s;e of
their &s;eparation, it was not owing to his pre|ference
of another, to idle caprice, or to
any motive which &s;hould make her blu&s;h
for his morals or his heart.</P>
<P>In this reliance on the honour of the man
to whom her heart was fondly devoted, &s;he
found &s;o much con&s;olation, that &s;he drove
from her as re&s;olutely as &s;he could all tho&s;e
&s;u&s;picions which had embittered her mind
<PB N="244" REF="246">
on the information Vava&s;our had given her.
She thought it very po&s;&s;ible that the Ca&s;tle|norths
<HI>were</HI> gone abroad, becau&s;e Lord
Ca&s;tlenorth was never well in England;
and his lady, of more con&s;equence among
the Engli&s;h in Italy than &s;he could be in
London or even at Ca&s;tlenorth, was much
fonder of being looked up to there, than in
being lo&s;t in the crowd of tho&s;e who were
of equal or &s;uperior rank at home. Their
daughter too affected foreign manners and
foreign &s;entiments; and with the figure
and countenance of a coar&s;e Engli&s;h fe|male
pea&s;ant, a&s;&s;umed &s;ometimes the ani|mated
vivacity of the Neapolitan beauty,
and &s;ometimes the in&s;inuating languor of
the Venetian; and when in England, had
very frequently declared her di&s;like of the
people and the country, and expre&s;&s;ed her
wonder that tho&s;e who could conver&s;e in
any other, &s;hould u&s;e the har&s;h and vulgar
language of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>That a family thus di&s;po&s;ed &s;hould not
remain in their native country, and above
<PB N="245" REF="247">
all, after the mortification they mu&s;t have
met with from Willoughby's rejection of
their alliance, was not extraordinary; but
Cele&s;tina endeavoured to per&s;uade her&s;elf,
that though they were on the Continent
it was with no intention of renewing their
negociation with him, to which their pride
would never &s;uffer them to &s;toop; and that,
though he &s;hould meet them there, it
would be on his part involuntary, and
only as the nephew of Lord Ca&s;tlenorth,
by no means as the lover of his daughter.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all her arguments, how|ever,
and all her dependance on Willough|by's
love and con&s;tancy, &s;he was &s;ometimes
con&s;cious of returns of &s;u&s;picion and fear;
and unable wholly to &s;tifle the pangs &s;he
then felt, &s;he endeavoured to think le&s;s of
her&s;elf and more of others; and above all,
to intere&s;t her&s;elf for Mrs. Elphin&s;tone,
who &s;eemed every hour more worthy of her
regard.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation &s;he
found, that Mr. and Mrs. Elphin&s;tone,
<PB N="246" REF="248">
reduced as they had lately been in circum|&s;tances,
had once been in a very different
&s;ituation of life; and &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t
the inclination &s;he felt to learn what rever&s;e
of fortune had thrown them into the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
condition which Je&s;&s;y had de&s;cribed
to her, and which had made a deep and
painful impre&s;&s;ion on the generous &s;en&s;i|bility
of Cele&s;tina: but however her anxiety
was excited, &s;he had &s;o much delicacy as
to avoid wounding her new friend by &s;hew|ing
it: unlike that very common de&s;crip|tion
of people, who love to enquire into
the &s;orrows and misfortunes of others, not
with any view to relieve or even to &s;oothe
them, but merely to gratify an impertinent
curio&s;ity, and to ri&s;e higher in their own
idea by the compari&s;on, while they cry like
the Phari&s;ee&mdash;"Lord I thank thee that I
am not as other men are, even as this pub|lican."</P>
<P>To an heart &s;uch as heaven had be&s;towed
on Cele&s;tina, there was &s;omething in mis|fortune
not only re&s;pectable but &s;acred;
<PB N="247" REF="249">
and &s;he behaved towards Mrs. Elphin&s;tone
with infinitely more attention than &s;he could
ever prevail upon her&s;elf to &s;hew to Mrs.
Thorold, amid all her bu&s;tle of affluence
and her claims upon the veneration of the
world from good dinners and rich connec|tions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, however, who was
aware that Cele&s;tina knew part of her hi&s;|tory,
was very &s;olicitous to relate to her the
whole of it; con&s;cious that in her opinion
&s;he &s;hould lo&s;e nothing, and that Cele&s;tina
had in &s;ome mea&s;ure a right to enquire
into the life of a per&s;on to whom &s;he had
given her confidence, and who was a can|didate
for her friend&s;hip and her e&s;teem.
She waited therefore a fit opportunity the
&s;econd day of their journey to drop &s;ome|thing
of her family; and &s;eeing that Cele&s;|tina
wi&s;hed to know more, &s;he &s;aid, &s;miling,&mdash;"It
is &s;omething like the per&s;onages
with whom we are pre&s;ented in old ro|mances,
and who meet in fore&s;ts and among
rocks and recount their adventures; but
<PB N="248" REF="250">
do you know, my dear Mi&s;s De Mornay,
that I feel very much di&s;po&s;ed to enact
&s;uch a per&s;onage, and though it is but a
painful &s;ubject, to relate to you my pa&s;t
life?"</P>
<P>"And do you know, dear Madam,"
replied Cele&s;tina, "that no wandering lady
in romance had ever more inclination to
lo&s;e her own reflections in li&s;tening to the
hi&s;tory of &s;ome friend who has by chance
met her, lo&s;t in the thorny labyrinth of
unea&s;y thoughts, than I have to li&s;ten to
you."</P>
<P>"Well then," rejoined Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone,
"you &s;hall hear all that has be|fallen
me, "even from my girli&s;h days."
Mine has been a life, not marked, I think,
with any thing very extraordinary but in|variable
ill fortune, which, though I could
not e&s;cape it, I tru&s;t I have &s;u&s;tained with
fortitude. But here," continued &s;he, point|ing
to her children, here are my little &s;up|porters:
without them, without feeling
that they were a tru&s;t committed to me by
<PB N="249" REF="251">
heaven, from my &s;acred attention to which,
no per&s;onal &s;ufferings, no care for my&s;elf,
could exempt me even for a moment, I
am afraid that I &s;hould have tired long ago
in the rude and various path I have trod.
But my exordium will be longer than my
hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>"My family are of Scotti&s;h origin. My
father, one of it's younger branches, was
&s;ettled as a merchant in London, and was
engaged in the American trade, by which
he was making a re&s;pectable provi&s;ion for
his family, of three daughters and three
&s;ons, of whom my dear Frank was the
younge&s;t, when the cour&s;e of his bu&s;ine&s;s
brought him acquainted with the family of
Mr. Elphin&s;tone, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the
We&s;t India i&s;lands.</P>
<P>"The father of Mr. Elphin&s;tone inhe|rited
&s;ome of the&s;e from his family, but, of
a greater part, became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by pur|cha&s;es
made of lands in the i&s;lands ceded
to England at the peace of 1762. They at
fir&s;t promi&s;ed to an&s;wer his mo&s;t &s;anguine
<PB N="250" REF="252">
expectations; and on the &s;trength of tho&s;e
promi&s;es he quitted the We&s;t Indies, where
he had lived many years on his own e&s;tate,
and came to London, e&s;tabli&s;hing his
hou&s;ehold in a &s;tile of expence more &s;uit|able
to his imaginary than his real fortune.
His family con&s;i&s;ted of a wife, who had
never been in England before, and who
brought with her all the pride &s;he had
boundle&s;sly indulged in Antigua, five chil|dren,
and as many negroes.</P>
<P>"A few years convinced Mr. Elphin|&s;tone
that he had reckoned &s;omewhat too
fa&s;t on his annual income; but he was not
di&s;po&s;ed to dimini&s;h the &s;hewy and expen|&s;ive
&s;tyle in which he fir&s;t &s;et out; and had
he him&s;elf thought of it, the oppo&s;ition he
was &s;ure to meet with from his wife and
children would have deterred him from
any attempt to put a &s;cheme of oeconomy
in practice.</P>
<P>"His daughters were mo&s;t expen&s;ively
educated, and &s;till more expen&s;ively
dre&s;&s;ed, their mother wi&s;ely making a
<PB N="251" REF="253">
point of their being always the be&s;t dre&s;&s;ed
girls in the &s;chool to which they were &s;ent,
though among their &s;choolfellows there
were many children of the nobility. The
two boys were placed at We&s;tmin&s;ter
School, where the elder was &s;oon di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
for having more money and le&s;s
under&s;tanding than any boy of his age,
and where the tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition which
he had been &s;uffered to exerci&s;e over the
unfortunate black people among whom he
had pa&s;&s;ed his childhood, broke out in &s;o
many in&s;tances, that he was as much hated
for his overbearing temper as de&s;pi&s;ed and
laughed at for his ignorance and his vanity.</P>
<P>"The younge&s;t, who is now my hu&s;|band,
was in every thing the rever&s;e of his
brother: open, good humoured, and un|de&s;igning;
too gay and carele&s;s to think,
too quick to learn, which, however para|doxical
it may &s;ound, is in many in&s;tances
true&mdash;the boy who knows he can learn in
half an hour a ta&s;k which another cannot
conquer in a day, is very apt to let alone
<PB N="252" REF="254">
learning it till application becomes too
late. Alexander Elphin&s;tone however was
&s;o much a favourite, that when he neg|lected
to do his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;omebody or other
was always willing to do it for him; and
when his father took him from &s;chool to
place him at an academy where he was to
be qualified for a merchant, he was as
much regretted as his brother was dete&s;ted,
who had now acquired in the &s;chool the
name of 'Squire Squa&s;hy, which he never
afterwards lo&s;t.</P>
<P>"It was about the year 1770, that Mr.
Elphin&s;tone, the father, in &s;eeking for a
counting hou&s;e to place his younge&s;t &s;on,
was introduced to my father. The pomp
with which the old gentleman was &s;ur|rounded,
the high &s;tyle in which he ac|cu&s;tomed
him&s;elf to talk, the detail of his
e&s;tates, (though &s;ome of them brought
him every year in debt,) his negroes, and
his &s;ugar works, dazzled my father's eyes,
who had been accu&s;tomed only to a plainer
&s;tile of life, and le&s;s flattering views of
<PB N="253" REF="255">
profit. He was plea&s;ed with the thoughts
of taking into his counting hou&s;e the &s;on
of a man &s;o opulent; and when he &s;aw
the young gentleman him&s;elf, was imme|diately
prejudiced in his favour. Elphin|&s;tone
was then a tall boy of &s;ixteen: his
dark complexion was enlivened by black
eyes full of &s;pirit and vivacity; and his
countenance, if not hand&s;ome, was expre&s;|&s;ive
of an open and ingenuous mind. The
premium which my father a&s;ked was agreed
to, and young Elphin&s;tone became one of
our family, which con&s;i&s;ted of my father,
his &s;econd wife, by whom he had no chil|dren,
my two &s;i&s;ters, and my&s;elf; for of my
three brothers, one was placed at the Tem|ple,
another was gone to the Ea&s;t Indies,
and the younge&s;t, my dear Frank, was
then at &s;chool.</P>
<P>"My mother-in-law was one of tho&s;e
common characters which are &s;o difficult to
de&s;cribe unle&s;s it be by negatives. She was
not ill natured; &s;he was not a woman of
under&s;tanding; &s;he was not hand&s;ome;
<PB N="254" REF="256">
&s;he was not young; &s;he was not well born
or well educated: but my father, who had
married her to take care of his family, and
to put the three thou&s;and pounds &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
into his bu&s;ine&s;s, was well enough
contented to &s;ee that &s;he did not behave
ill to his children, that &s;he brought him no
more, and that &s;he had always a plain din|ner
ready for him when he came from
'Change; was &s;atisfied with going on a
Saturday to a country hou&s;e at Clapton,
near Hackney, and receiving the vi&s;its of
the wives and daughters of traders like
him&s;elf; and had been brought up with
no higher ideas of elegance than what were
an&s;wered by their &s;ociety, or fancied any
&s;uperior entertainment was to be found
than what &s;he enjoyed in the front boxes at
a play twice a year, or in a Chri&s;tmas at|tendance
at Hackney A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>"It is true that on the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;he
loved to be fine, to wear rich &s;ilks and
good lace, to clean and exhibit her mo|ther's
ro&s;e-diamond ear rings, and to wear
<PB N="255" REF="257">
my father's picture by way of bracelet,
fa&s;tened by garnets on her comfortable
round arm. But the&s;e were indulgences
about which he never contended; and was
rather plea&s;ed that Mrs. and the Mi&s;s
Cathcarts began to be con&s;idered as people
of &s;ome con&s;equence in the circle in which
they moved, while he gradually obtained
in the city the name of a warm man.</P>
<P>"I was not more than eleven years old
when Mr. Elphin&s;tone became a member
of our family. One of my &s;i&s;ters was four
years older, and the other a year younger;
but my elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, at about the age of
&s;eventeen, was married to a young We&s;t
Indian of whom my father had the care,
and went with him to &s;ettle in Barbadoes.
My &s;i&s;ter Emily and I grew up to con&s;ider
Elphin&s;tone as our brother; but I &s;oon
learned to think of him with particular par|tiality,
and to grieve at the frequent oc|ca&s;ions
which my father had to complain
of him. He was wild, eccentric, and un|governable:
&s;ometimes rode away to races
<PB N="256" REF="258">
when he ought to have been &s;ettling with
the grocers, (for my father was now deeply
engaged in the We&s;t India trade,) and
&s;ometimes got into &s;crapes with his old
&s;choolfellows, and was found at the watch-hou&s;e
in&s;tead of the counting hou&s;e; or if
he attended tho&s;e &s;olemn meetings at which
the price of freight or the quality of O&s;na|burghs
was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, he turned the vene|rable
per&s;ons of the old merchants and
grocers into ridicule; and while they
thought he was making calculations, was
frequently drawing caricatures of them in
all their maje&s;ty of wig, upon the leaves
of his memorandum book. But with all
this, he was &s;o capable of bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o
ready with his pen, and &s;o perfectly ma&s;ter
of accounts, that my father often &s;aid he
could do more bu&s;ine&s;s in an hour than he
him&s;elf could do in three; and that if once
he became &s;teady, he would make a great
figure as a merchant.</P>
<P>"His father, the elder Mr. Elphin&s;tone,
found it convenient, after his &s;on had been
<PB N="257" REF="259">
with us a year or two, to cultivate very a&s;|&s;iduou&s;ly
an acquaintance with our family.
Mrs. Elphin&s;tone, who had reluctantly
con&s;ented that her younge&s;t &s;on &s;hould be
brought up a merchant, now conde&s;cended
to vi&s;it us, and in her drawling way to at|tempt
civility. The Mi&s;s Elphin&s;tone's
were directed to forget the di&s;tance between
Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare and Mincing lane, and
to vi&s;it us often; while we were of cour&s;e
mightily delighted to receive invitations to
their routs, and to be admitted to add to
the croud which four or five times in a
winter filled their rooms in Cavendi&s;h
&s;quare.</P>
<P>"In&s;en&s;ibly my good mother in law ac|quired
a ta&s;te for what was then called the
other end of the town; and no longer
contented with the gratifications of Haber|da&s;her's
Hall, or the Crown and Anchor,
which had once been the utmo&s;t limits of
her ambition, &s;he learned to &s;igh for the
Soho A&s;&s;embly, for five and twenty tables,
<PB N="258" REF="260">
and the company of "titled Dowagers
and Yellow Admirals."</P>
<P>"If this unfortunate mania &s;eized her,
it was not wonderful that it extended it|&s;elf
to us. Emily had a very fine voice,
and the Mi&s;s Elphin&s;tones had concerts to
which &s;he was invited. We both had
learned among our&s;elves to act parts of
plays; the Mi&s;s Elphin&s;tones had at their
hou&s;e at Ealing a private theatre, and we
were promoted to parts in their drama.
Looking upon us as inferior to them in
our per&s;ons, in our education, in our fa|mily
and in our fortunes, no idea of rivalry
ever di&s;turbed this intercour&s;e, and in&s;en|&s;ibly
we pa&s;&s;ed more time with them than
we did at home; whither I &s;hould always
have returned with murmurs and regret, if
it had not been the only place where I
could meet young Elphin&s;tone without
witne&s;&s;es, the only place where &s;ome folly
of the moment did not &s;eem to make him
forget the preference he profe&s;&s;ed to give
me.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="261">
"Such was the &s;ituation of the two fa|milies,
when the elde&s;t &s;on of the Elphin|&s;tone's,
the gentleman who had been di&s;|tingui&s;hed
at We&s;tmin&s;ter by the appella|tion
of 'Squire Squa&s;hy, arrived from a
twelvemonth's tour in France and Italy,
and with him a &s;ort of tutor who had been
&s;ent with him at a very exorbitant &s;alary.
To all the native arrogance and invincible
&s;tupidity of his original character, this
elder brother had added the pertne&s;s of
fancied knowledge and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of travelled &s;uperiority; a more di&s;gu&s;ting
character could hardly be imagined. He
was now not only above all the re&s;t of the
world, but infinitely above his own family:
his mother was &s;ilenced by&mdash;"Good Ma|dam!
how is it po&s;&s;ible <HI>you</HI> &s;hould know?"
his father, by a &s;ilent &s;hrug of contempt
and a di&s;dain of argument; while his
&s;i&s;ters, who piqued them&s;elves upon their
elegance and fa&s;hion, were ridiculed for
being <HI>&s;i bourgoi&s;e,</HI> that they were hardly
within the po&s;&s;ibility of being made <HI>comme|il
<PB N="260" REF="262">
faut.</HI> As to my &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf, who
were with them when he arrived, he
looked at us once through his opera gla&s;s,
enquired who we were, and hearing we
were the daughters of his father's merchant
and lived in the city, he never, on any oc|ca&s;ion
that I can recollect, deigned to no|tice
us again. Unhappily, the gentleman
who had travelled and who &s;till continued
with him, &s;aw with different eyes my poor
little Emily, then not quite fifteen: he
affected to be highly plea&s;ed with her &s;ing|ing,
and undertook to give her in&s;tructions.
He would teach us both French, and cor|rected
our acting. We were invited to
pa&s;s two months at Ealing, at a hou&s;e
which Mr. Elphin&s;tone rented, and to
which his daughters had given the name
of Cypre&s;s Grove, though not a cypre&s;s
higher than a goo&s;eberry-bu&s;h was near it;
and there we were to act plays: in which,
though the elder hope of the family de|clined
taking a part and ab&s;ented him&s;elf
from the &s;et entirely, his travelling friend,
<PB N="261" REF="263">
who&s;e name was Beresford, was of great
con&s;equence; and Alexander Elphin&s;tone
was permitted by my father to quit, on
tho&s;e occa&s;ions, the high counting &s;tool
and &s;harp de&s;k for the throne of King
Pyrrhus, or the triumphal car of his name|&s;ake
Alexander.</P>
<P>"I will own, that young as I then was,
being not quite &s;ixteen, my childi&s;h heart
was enchanted with the&s;e amu&s;ements, e&s;|pecially
when <HI>he</HI> bore a part in them to
whom that heart was already &s;o fondly
attached. Un&s;u&s;pecting and artle&s;s, I
dreamed not of the mi&s;chief which lurked
under all this fe&s;tive plea&s;ure; and inca|pable
of thinking for my&s;elf, I was a very
in&s;ufficient guard to my &s;i&s;ter, who was
&s;till younger and more thoughtle&s;s; yet to
me was &s;he entru&s;ted; unle&s;s, which did
not very often happen, my mother left
the card table to be a &s;pectator of the
amu&s;ements of the younger part of the
company.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="264">
"Emily, however, was always with me;
but it is true that young Elphin&s;tone was
always with me too, and in li&s;tening to
him, I heard not or attended not to the
more dangerous conver&s;ation with which
Mr. Beresford entertained my &s;i&s;ter. He
contrived mo&s;t artfully to put her upon her
guard again&s;t all confidence, which he
knew mu&s;t ruin his &s;cheme; and the fir&s;t
idea I had of my poor Emily's misfortune,
was, when on awaking one morning I
found &s;he was already ri&s;en, contrary to
her u&s;ual cu&s;tom. I was not, however,
alarmed, till, on beginning to dre&s;s my&s;elf,
I found the drawers where we kept our
cloaths were emptied of every thing of
her's: even then I had only a confu&s;ed idea
of what had happened, 'till, in looking
wildly round the room, I &s;aw a note upon
the table, which I opened in trembling
a&s;toni&s;hment, and read thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

</LETTER>
<P>"My ideas were at once &s;o painful and
&s;o confu&s;ed, that I lo&s;t all recollection for
a moment, and running down &s;tairs half
dre&s;&s;ed as I was, I a&s;ked in breathle&s;s agi|tation
for my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;my &s;i&s;ter Emily! The
&s;ervants who were up, (for it was yet early
morning,) &s;tared at me without compre|hending
my di&s;tre&s;s; and I found nobody
di&s;po&s;ed to attend to me till the younger
Elphin&s;tone met me and eagerly enquired
what was the matter. I put the note I held
into his hand, &s;at down in the &s;eat of a
<PB N="264" REF="266">
window, and bur&s;t into tears. He &s;aw in
a moment what my ignorance of the world
had in &s;ome mea&s;ure concealed from me;
and knowing that Beresford was the la&s;t
man in the world likely to marry, he knew
that Emily was lo&s;t. Neither my father or
his wife were then at Ealing; and he
pau&s;ed a moment on what could be done.</P>
<P>"He then endeavoured to con&s;ole and
rea&s;&s;ure me, and went to his father and his
mother to inform them of what had hap|pened.
The old gentleman came to me in
a few moments, advi&s;ed me to go imme|diately
home and acquaint my parents, and
&s;ent a &s;ervant for a po&s;t chai&s;e, in which
he &s;aid his younger &s;on &s;hould attend me.
I hardly know how I left the hou&s;e; but
I remember Mrs. Elphin&s;tone did not ap|pear,
and that the young ladies expre&s;&s;ed
none of that concern which I thought I
&s;hould have felt for the re&s;t, had any one
of them di&s;appeared under circum&s;tances
&s;o prejudicial to their fame."</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267">
The travellers now arrived at Stilton,
where they were to re&s;t that night. It was
late, and Mrs. Elphin&s;tone appearing a
good deal fatigued, Cele&s;tina be&s;ought her
to delay any farther gratification of her
curio&s;ity till the next day. She then a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
her friend in giving her children their
&s;upper and putting them to bed; and after
a &s;hort repa&s;t together, they retired to re&s;t
in two beds in the &s;ame room, where the
children were already a&s;leep.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE following day they proceeded
early on their journey, and Mrs. Elphin|&s;tone
thus rea&s;&s;umed her narrative.&mdash;"In
our way from Ealing to London, Alexan|der
Elphin&s;tone endeavoured by every ar|gument
in his power to &s;trengthen my re|&s;olution,
and calm tho&s;e fears I expre&s;&s;ed
at meeting with my father and mother; who
would, I apprehended, be enraged again&s;t
me for a misfortune they had them&s;elves
taken no pains to prevent. This dreadful
meeting mu&s;t however be hazarded: I
tottered as well as I was able into the dining-room,
and &s;ending for my father out of
his counting-hou&s;e, I put into his hands
the fatal note, and informed him as well
as I could of what had happened. He
<PB N="267" REF="269">
was too rea&s;onable to blame me for an
error he had as little fore&s;een him&s;elf; but
ha&s;tening out of the room with Elphin|&s;tone,
enquired, as I afterwards learned,
whether he thought Beresford meant to
marry my &s;i&s;ter? Elphin&s;tone, with &s;ome
he&s;itation, an&s;wered that he feared not. "Let
us then," &s;aid he, "endeavour to find
her, and if it be po&s;&s;ible, hu&s;h up this un|happy
affair before it becomes more known."</P>
<P>"Elphin&s;tone mo&s;t willingly agreed to
a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the &s;earch, and my elder bro|ther
was &s;ent for from the Temple for the
&s;ame purpo&s;e. <HI>His</HI> anger and indignation
were much more turbulent than my father's.
He vowed vengeance again&s;t Beresford,
and &s;at out in pur&s;uit of him in &s;uch a
temper of mind as made me dread the
con&s;equence &s;hould he find him.</P>
<P>"To find him, however, every effort
proved abortive. Among other places, my
Mr. Elphin&s;tone went to enquire for him
at the lodgings his elder brother had taken
in Piccadilly. The 'Squire received him
<PB N="268" REF="270">
with that contemptuous coldne&s;s which he
thought was all he owed to a merchant's
clerk; and upon his eager enquiry after
Berresford, and learning the rea&s;on of it,
he &s;aid&mdash;"What a fu&s;s is here, indeed,
about a little gri&s;ette: why, one would
think Beresford had carried off an
heire&s;s. Let him alone, and I dare &s;ay
he will bring her back again." His bro|ther,
enraged at this in&s;ult, &s;poke to him
very freely, which he returned no other|wi&s;e
than by calling him quill-driver, and
maccaroni of Mincing-lane. The brothers
parted in wrath; and the younger returned
home lamenting his fruitle&s;s &s;earch, and
devi&s;ing new mea&s;ures for the next day.
The&s;e, however, were equally &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s.
Poor Emily was lo&s;t to us for ever; and
the feeble hope that Beresford might have
married her every day became fainter.</P>
<P>"This unhappy affair put an end to our
intercour&s;e with the Elphin&s;tone family,
and was indeed the fir&s;t &s;ignal of a long
long &s;eries of calamities. I ob&s;erved that
<PB N="269" REF="271">
my father grew extremely unea&s;y at &s;ome|thing
that related to the &s;ituation of his
affairs: he began to complain that Mr.
Elphin&s;tone's remittances fell very &s;hort of
what he expected; that he was paid no in|tere&s;t
for the large &s;ums he had advanced
for him; and while he was deliberating
how to get out of the difficulties the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances
threw him into, he received
information, that Mr. Elphin&s;tone, deeply
involved before, had been overwhelmed
by the expences of his elde&s;t &s;on, and the
failure of his remittances, had gone off in
the night from his hou&s;e at Ealing to Fal|mouth,
whence he had embarked in the
packet for Antigua; while his lady and fa|mily
had &s;hut up their hou&s;es at Ealing
and in Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare, and were gone
to Bath.</P>
<P>"The&s;e terrible tidings fell on my fa|ther
like a &s;troke of thunder, and for &s;ome
time he was unable to attempt applying
any remedy to the evils he &s;aw gathering
around him. But from the torpor of imme|diate
<PB N="270" REF="272">
angui&s;h, he was rou&s;ed by the pre&s;|&s;ing
demands of tho&s;e, of whom he had on
his own &s;ecurity borrowed money for the
&s;upply of Mr. Elphin&s;tone. It was at a
&s;ea&s;on when many months were to intervene
before he could receive any remittances from
his corre&s;pondent, even if his corre&s;pondent
&s;hould have honour enough to &s;end them,
and bankruptcy and ruin &s;eemed inevi|table.
He had however, as he thought, a
friend in a very eminent banker, who a
few months before, on his engaging &s;o
largely with Mr. Elphin&s;tone, had heard
&s;ome report that that gentleman, had in|fluenced
him in favour of the banker with
whom <HI>he</HI> was connected; on which my
father's friend, a man of immen&s;e pro|perty,
had then written to him thus&mdash;</P>

<P>"The eyes of my poor father were now
compleatly opened, and all the horrors of
his fate were before him. Young Elphin|&s;tone,
&s;till &s;anguine as to his father's pro|perty
and his father's honour, was on this
occa&s;ion his great re&s;ource. He was in|defatigable
in &s;temming the torrent of ill|fortune
thus brought upon us; and &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="274" REF="276">
&s;o well by various expedients, as
to &s;upport for a while the &s;inking credit of
the hou&s;e; but &s;eeing my father become
every day more and more anxious, and
doubtful about the elder Mr. Elphin&s;tone,
he propo&s;ed to go over to Antigua him&s;elf;
and to this propo&s;al added, that of marry|ing
me and taking me with him. My fa|ther,
who found his health giving way un|der
the accumulated calamities that had
lately befallen him, now thought it better
to accept this propo&s;al, and by a union of
families make it Mr. Elphin&s;tone's intere&s;t
to be ju&s;t. We were married then, after
a reluctant con&s;ent wrung from the haughty
mother of my lover, and three weeks after|wards
embarked for the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>"I was not yet old enough to con&s;ider the
&s;ituation of our fortune with any great con|cern:
but I parted from my own father
with a &s;ad pre&s;entiment that we were to
meet no more, and I dreaded my intro|duction
to the father of my hu&s;band. But
I loved <HI>him;</HI> he was the mo&s;t cheerful and
<PB N="275" REF="277">
&s;anguine creature in the world; and painted
to me only &s;cenes of pro&s;perity and
happine&s;s, which I was well plea&s;ed to con|template
as true repre&s;entations. Gracious
heaven! could I <HI>then</HI> have fore&s;een all
the mi&s;ery that was in &s;tore for me, how
&s;hould I have &s;hrunk from a de&s;tiny &s;o in|&s;upportable!
how &s;hould I have wi&s;hed
that in a violent &s;torm we met in the Bay
of Bi&s;cay, we might peri&s;h.</P>
<P>"We arrived, however, after a tedious
pa&s;&s;age, at Antigua; and I was relieved
from the di&s;comforts of a long voyage, to
encounter, as I believed, what I dreaded
more&mdash;the di&s;dain and rudene&s;s of my fa|ther
in law. I landed, trembling with this
apprehen&s;ion, di&s;gu&s;ted with every thing I
&s;aw, and overcome with heat and &s;ickne&s;s:
but the fir&s;t intelligence we heard was,
that Mr. Elphin&s;tone had been dead about
a week of an epidemical di&s;temper, and
that his hou&s;es and plantations were in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the agents of his elde&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>"It was in vain that my hu&s;band de&s;ired
<PB N="276" REF="278">
to be admitted to re&s;ide on one of them
till he could &s;ee into his father's affairs: the
people who had been placed there refu&s;ed
him any &s;atisfaction; and it was only by
applying to the Governor that he at length
obtained a &s;ight of the will, by which he
found that his father had left every thing to
his elder brother, and an annuity to his
mother of eight hundred a year, with five
thou&s;and pounds, to each of his daughters
and to his younge&s;t &s;on: but as the e&s;tates
were not charged with the&s;e la&s;t legacies,
nor able to pay them if it had, his nominal
fortune gave him but little comfort, nor
alleviated the concern with which he &s;aw
too evidently that all the &s;ums of money
lent by <HI>my</HI> father to <HI>his,</HI> were entirely
lo&s;t.</P>
<P>"The pain this gave him, the ince&s;&s;ant
fatigue to which he expo&s;ed him&s;elf in go|ing
to Granada and St. Vincents, where
his father had made purcha&s;es, at length
overcame the natural &s;trength of his con|&s;titution.
After we had been about four
<PB N="277" REF="279">
months in the We&s;t Indies, living with
his friends, he was &s;eized at Granada with
one of tho&s;e &s;evers &s;o common in that cli|mate.
An old French lady, who lived on
her own e&s;tate near the lonely habitation
where he was taken ill, had pity upon him,
took him to her hou&s;e, and by her extra|ordinary
care carried him through the di&s;or|der:
but he was very long in a &s;tate of infan|tine
weakne&s;s, and could articulate nothing
but a reque&s;t that he might &s;ee his wife.
It was &s;ome time before I received intel|ligence
of his &s;ituation, and &s;ome time lon|ger
before I could get to him. The kind|ne&s;s
of our foreign friend did not &s;top
there: I was now in a &s;tate which excited
her generous compa&s;&s;ion towards me, and
&s;he in&s;i&s;ted, that in&s;tead of returning to
Europe in a &s;ituation &s;o unfit for a voyage,
I &s;hould &s;tay with her, till the birth of my
child.</P>
<P>"Poor Elphin&s;tone's weak condition of
health indeed, rendered &s;uch a voyage as im|practicable
for him as for me. We accepted
<PB N="278" REF="280">
therefore the generous ho&s;pitality of Ma|dame
Du Moulinet, and at her hou&s;e in
Granada my elde&s;t child was born.</P>
<P>"During the five months we remained
there, we heard that the elder brother
was come over him&s;elf to Antigua and had
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing. We had
therefore no bu&s;ine&s;s to go back, where
we had no authority nor indeed any provi|&s;ion;
but as &s;oon as our ho&s;te&s;s would
give us leave, embarked again, to return
to England more de&s;titute than we had left
it, and with a little unfortunate baby to
&s;hare our di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>"We arrived there, after an ab&s;ence of
thirteen months; and ha&s;tened to London
as cheaply as we could, for we had very little
money. My poor Elphin&s;tone left me at
the inn where we &s;topped, and went to
my father's hou&s;e. Never &s;hall I forget the
look with which he returned to me: his
bloodle&s;s cheeks, his wild eyes, his trem|bling
lips, &s;poke before he could utter a
&s;yllable. He &s;at down; looked earne&s;tly
<PB N="279" REF="281">
on me a moment, then on his child, which
was &s;leeping in my arms, &s;tarted up, ran
from us, &s;taggered towards the wain&s;cot,
and fell.</P>
<P>"My &s;crearns brought the people of the
inn into our mi&s;erable room. They took
up the unhappy young man, and gave him
what a&s;&s;i&s;tance they could, &s;uppo&s;ing that
he had fallen into a fit. After a moment,
he recovered his &s;peech, and entreating to
be left alone with me, told me that my fa|ther
was dead in&s;olvent, all his effects
&s;old, and my mother in law gone to re&s;ide
with her relations in the North: "and 'tis I
have undone thee, my Sophy," cried he&mdash;tis
I and my family who have reduced
thee to beggary, and now I have not a
place wherein to &s;helter thee and this dear
haple&s;s innocent."</P>
<P>"Agony now choaked his utterance; and
all my re&s;olution was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent
his relap&s;ing into the &s;tate he had ju&s;t reco|vered
from. Sti&s;ling therefore my own an|gui&s;h,
I be&s;ought him to take courage; de|clared
<PB N="280" REF="282">
that I feared nothing while he was
with me and well, and urged him to think of
&s;ome place where we might pa&s;s the night
and recover courage to encounter what was
before us.</P>
<P>"He &s;eemed comforted by my calmne&s;s,
and recollected an old &s;ervant of his father's
who kept a lodging hou&s;e in Northum|berland-&s;treet.
Thither we determined to
go; the man was gone from thence, but
&s;ome other people who let lodgings now in|habited
the hou&s;e: they had a bed cham|ber
on the &s;econd floor to let; and know|ing
&s;omething of us, took us in.</P>
<P>"Fatigue of body overcame for a &s;hort
time the agony of mind my poor hu&s;band
had felt. He was a&s;leep by me; my infant
was at my brea&s;t; but <HI>I</HI> could not &s;leep;
all the horrors of poverty were before me,
and my agitated &s;pirit ran over every hope
which yet remained for us, but re&s;ted &s;e|curely
on none.</P>
<P>"The morning at la&s;t came; and I now
de&s;ired Elphin&s;tone to enquire out my el|de&s;t
<PB N="281" REF="283">
brother, who when we went away had
chambers in the Temple; and to di&s;cover
what was become of my dear Frank, whom
we had left at &s;chool, and to whom I was
always fondly attached. Poor Emily too
recurred to me, but for her, alas! I
dared not enquire.</P>
<P>"He went out, therefore, after break|fa&s;t,
and returned in about an hour with
looks that gave me no favourable impre&s;|&s;ion
of his &s;ucce&s;s. My elde&s;t brother, he
told me, had left his chambers, and had
been married &s;ome months to a young wo|man
of &s;ome fortune, at lea&s;t in expectancy,
being the only child of her parents, with
whom they lived; and that her father, an
attorney of practice in Warwick-court Hol|born,
had taken my brother into his bu&s;i|ne&s;s.
"I &s;aw him however," &s;aid Elphin|&s;tone;
"but he received me &s;o coldly
that I &s;hall hardly repeat the vi&s;it."</P>
<P>"My heart &s;unk cold within me, and
I had hardly courage to a&s;k what was be|come
of Frank.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="284">
"He is at I know not what academy,
replied Elphin&s;tone. "Your brother John
told me, very coolly, that though he was
&s;o lucky as to have a provi&s;ion by mar|riage
him&s;elf, it was out of his power to
provide for all his father's family; and
thought it quite enough, that he had been
at &s;o much expence for Frank, who mu&s;t
now," &s;aid he, "do &s;omething for him&s;elf,
for I cannot undertake to pay his &s;chool|ing
another year: and you, Sir, as it is
owing to your family that my father was
ruined, I hope you will now take this
burthen off my hands; for my wife's fa|mily
are very much di&s;contented at my
bearing it."</P>
<P>"Gracious God!" cried I, "what will
become of us! Oh, my poor baby! why
wert thou ever born!"</P>
<P>"To embitter our calamities," cried El|phin&s;tone.
"Rather a&s;k, my Sophy, why
<HI>I</HI> was ever born, who brought them upon
thee, and on that dear little victim."</P>
<P>"We had &s;o little money left, that it
was nece&s;&s;ary to think of &s;omething di|rectly:
<PB N="283" REF="285">
Elphin&s;tone therefore went out
again to enquire after his mother and his
&s;i&s;ters, from &s;ome of tho&s;e families who
had, during their &s;plendour, been the
fonde&s;t of their &s;ociety and the mo&s;t fre|quently
at their hou&s;e. Among the&s;e was
one lady who had always profe&s;&s;ed the
greate&s;t affection in the world for them
all; never &s;poke to Mrs. Elphin&s;tone
but as her dear friend, nor to her
children under any other appellation
than her &s;weet creatures, or her amiable
young friends. Elphin&s;tone gave me, as
nearly as he could, the words in which &s;he
an&s;wered his enquiry.</P>
<P>"Why, my dear, dear Sir, you mu&s;t
think how &s;hocked and amazed I was&mdash;your
poor good mother!&mdash;to be &s;ure I
had a mo&s;t &s;incere regard for her&mdash;and
your &s;i&s;ters too; good &s;weet young wo|men&mdash;&s;o
amiable, &s;o accompli&s;hed!&mdash;I'm
amazed they never married.&mdash;Well,
poor things&mdash;God knows, to be &s;ure,
what is be&s;t for us:&mdash;Whatever is, is
right, as Pope ob&s;erves."</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="286">
"But, dear Madam, I mu&s;t beg to learn
where my mother and my &s;i&s;ters are?&mdash;I
am but ju&s;t come from the &s;hip that
brought me back to England."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible!&mdash;Poor young gentle|man!&mdash;I'm
&s;ure I wi&s;h I could inform
you of any thing agreeable. You don't
know, then, perhaps, that every thing in
Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare, and at Ealing, was
&s;old under executions, as I heard; but I
heartily hope it was not &s;o. Such a re|&s;pectable
family! and &s;o many fine young
people! and your poor good mother!&mdash;I
&s;aw her at Bath la&s;t winter, after tho&s;e
di&s;agreeable affairs, and was &s;orry to &s;ee
that &s;he had lo&s;t a great deal of her
cheerfulne&s;s. To be &s;ure that was not to
be wondered at. I told her how &s;incerely
I wi&s;hed her a plea&s;ant voyage, poor
worthy woman!" After being compelled
to li&s;ten to a great deal more of this ful|&s;ome
cant, he at length learned that one of
his &s;i&s;ters boarded with an apothecary's fa|mily
at Bath, being in an ill &s;tate of health;
and that his mother, and the other two
<PB N="285" REF="287">
&s;i&s;ters, finding Mr. Elphin&s;tone, who was
di&s;tingui&s;hed as 'Squire Squa&s;hy, little di&s;|po&s;ed
to do them ju&s;tice, had, by advice of
their friends, embarked for Antigua; &s;o
that we probably pa&s;&s;ed them at &s;ea.</P>
<P>"This was terrible! Every re&s;ource
&s;eemed to fail us, and in a few days fa|mine
was likely to &s;tare us in the face.
My beloved brother Frank, however, was,
among all my own di&s;tre&s;&s;es, ever near my
heart; and I determined for his &s;ake, and
becau&s;e I would leave nothing unattempted
for Elphin&s;tone and my child, to go my&s;elf
to my elde&s;t brother, to implore the kind|ne&s;s
of one, and obtain a &s;ight of the other.
I &s;aid nothing, however, to Elphin&s;tone
of this intention, fearing he might op|po&s;e
it. I &s;et forth alone, with my baby
in my arms, for I could not leave it,
nor could I afford to hire a coach. I rap|ped
at the door; and enquiring for Mr.
Cathcart, was told by the footman who
opened it, that I might wait in the pa&s;&s;age,
and he would &s;ee. In the pa&s;&s;age I waited
&s;ome minutes, and was then told that Mr.
<PB N="286" REF="288">
Cathcart was bu&s;y with &s;ome gentlemen,
and that I mu&s;t &s;end in my bu&s;ine&s;s and
call again.</P>
<P>"Ah! Mi&s;s De Mornay, you have no
relations, I think; nor can ever, nor will
ever, I hope, "feel how &s;harper than a &s;er|pent's
tooth it is" to meet cruelty and
&s;corn from tho&s;e to whom the &s;ick heart
looks for pity and protection.</P>
<P>"I was unwilling to &s;end in my name
and a verbal me&s;&s;age, as there were people
with him; I therefore &s;at down on a bench
where porters and &s;ervants &s;it in tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages,
and wrote with a pencil&mdash;"It is
your &s;i&s;ter Sophy, who cannot call again."
This brought out the great man, for great
he &s;uddenly was become. His likene&s;s to
my father, the tender recollection that he
was my brother, made me forget all his
unkindne&s;s the moment I &s;aw him, and
I was throwing my&s;elf and my child into
his arms, when a cold&mdash;how d'ye do Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone? fixed me to the place. I
&s;uppo&s;e he thought by my looks that I
<PB N="287" REF="289">
&s;hould faint, and was afraid of being ex|po&s;ed
to his &s;ervants and new relations,
for he took my hand, faintly ki&s;&s;ed my
cheek, and leading me into a little dark
parlour where there was no fire, and de&s;ired
me to &s;it down.</P>
<P>"Some remains of natural affection,
which, in a young man, is very rarely
totally extingui&s;hed, &s;eemed to be contend|ing
with pride, avarice, and mean policy,
and for a while kept him &s;ilent: he then
enquired coldly into our &s;ituation, and as
I related it, (for he had no idea it was &s;o
bad,) I &s;aw tho&s;e affections gradually &s;hrink
from the detail: his heart &s;eemed to become
harder as it's tenderne&s;s became more ne|ce&s;&s;ary;
and he declared to me at la&s;t,
that I had formed erroneous ideas of his
&s;ituation if I thought it was in his power
to be of any &s;ervice to me. I ro&s;e to go;
but de&s;ired a direction to Frank, which he
gave me very unwillingly; for &s;ince I
could contribute nothing to his &s;upport,
he thought it u&s;ele&s;s for me to &s;ee him.
<PB N="288" REF="290">
I do not now very well know how I got out
of the hou&s;e of this cruel brother, who ne|ver
introduced me to his family, or &s;eemed
to wi&s;h to &s;ee me again: but I recollect
that when I came into Holborn I became
&s;o very faint and &s;ick, that I was obliged
to get into a coach to return home, which
I paid for by changing the la&s;t guinea I had
in the world.</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear Mi&s;s De Mornay!
veteran in &s;orrow as I have &s;ince been, I
look back with wonder on the &s;cene I af|terwards
pa&s;&s;ed through; I wonder how
I &s;upported it. We lingered on for three
months at the&s;e lodgings; my beloved
Frank often, and always happy to be with
us. He was now near &s;ixteen; very tall and
very manly, and repeatedly declared to
Elphin&s;tone that he was well able to get
his bread, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in any way of
bu&s;ine&s;s he could enter into. Bu&s;ine&s;s
however was not to be obtained without
money; but my father's creditors knowing
how well Elphin&s;tone was acquainted with
<PB N="289" REF="291">
his affairs, engaged him to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in
recovering debts due to him, and allowed
him from time to time &s;ome very trifling
compen&s;ation, which was our only &s;up|port.</P>
<P>As long, however, as he was well&mdash;as
long as my little boy ble&s;t me by it's
innocent &s;miles, I murmured at nothing;
and the little time I could &s;pare from nur&s;|ing
him, and after he was in his cradle of
a night, I found exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure in ap|plying
tho&s;e little arts I had learned as
matters of amu&s;ement, to the purpo&s;es of
profit. They produced not much; but in
our &s;ituation every thing was an help; and
our &s;imple meal, partly the produce of my
indu&s;try, and &s;hared with my brother
Frank, after Elphin&s;tone came home of a
night, was infinitely a &s;weeter banquet
than the in&s;ipid though &s;plendid tables of
the affluent had formerly afforded me. At
length, however, the per&s;ecution of ill for|tune,
which &s;eemed to have relaxed a
little, began anew, and mi&s;ery fell upon me
<PB N="290" REF="292">
where I could lea&s;t bear it. Elphin&s;tone
was &s;eized again with an infectious fever,
differing only from that he had at Gre|nada,
in the &s;ymptoms occa&s;ioned by dif|ference
of climate. On his attendance on
the creditors, our daily and &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence
depended: with his confinement,
every aid of that &s;ort cea&s;ed; and I &s;aw
him langui&s;hing in a &s;ick bed, in all the
depre&s;&s;ion of a malignant fever, without the
means of giving him the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>"A neighbouring apothecary, however,
attended him, who told me that wine was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be given him in
large quantities. Where was I to get it?&mdash;For
the fir&s;t time, I had recour&s;e to a
pawnbroker, and my dear, dear Frank was
my agent: for now, attached entirely to
us, he quitted his &s;chool, where, indeed,
he knew more than the ma&s;ter, and gave
him&s;elf up wholly to our &s;ervice: while
my brother John, not &s;orry to be relieved
from the expence of &s;upporting him, re|mon&s;trated,
<PB N="291" REF="293">
or rather quarrelled with him
once, and, obtaining an excu&s;e for &s;hak|ing
him off, &s;aw him no more.</P>
<P>"I had a watch, and a few trinkets;
the&s;e were fir&s;t di&s;po&s;ed off, and then &s;uch
clothes as I could &s;pare; for I could not
endure the thoughts of taking any thing that
belonged to Elphin&s;tone, though my trem|bling
heart too often whi&s;pered that he
would want them no more. Youth, and
the &s;trength of his con&s;titution, carried him
on many days through a rapid and gene|rally
fatal di&s;temper; and, at length, my
fainting courage was &s;u&s;tained by the hope
of his recovery, when my lovely infant
was &s;eized with the &s;ame terrible di&s;order;
and I was told, that as it was almo&s;t
always fatal to children, I mu&s;t not hope.</P>
<P>"I know not, then, what became of
me; but I think, that for &s;ome hours I was
not in my &s;en&s;es. I recollect being &s;eized
with an earne&s;t wi&s;h to have my child
attended by a phy&s;ician I had heard named,
as eminent for his humanity as for his
<PB N="292" REF="294">
peculiar &s;kill in this di&s;order; and, as Frank
was not at that moment with us, I wrap|ped
my&s;elf in an old cloak, and leaving
my poor infant to the care of his father,
who was ju&s;t able to &s;it by the cradle and
look at him with eyes of hopele&s;s agony, I
went away my&s;elf to implore this phy&s;ician
to come to us; and had ju&s;t &s;en&s;e enough
to remember the direction I had received
to his hou&s;e, but none to notice the objects
around me, or to care what people might
think, who &s;aw me, with wild looks and
uncertain &s;teps, hurrying through the crowd
of the bu&s;y and the happy.</P>
<P>"I had proceeded as far as the corner
of Cecil-&s;treet, when a croud of carriages
and pa&s;&s;engers impeded the cro&s;&s;ing; I
was making my way through them, heed|le&s;s
of the danger, and hardly hearing the
noi&s;e, when a footman, in a livery glitter|ing
with lace, &s;topped me, and told me he
was ordered by his lady to beg I would
&s;tep to the door of her carriage and &s;peak
to her.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="295">
"Oh! I cannot; I cannot, indeed," re|plied
I, without enquiring who his lady
was: "my child&mdash;my child is ill&mdash;I am
"going for advice for him." I would have
pa&s;&s;ed the man; but he followed me, and
pointed to an elegant vis-a-vis that was
drawn up clo&s;e to the broad pavement.
"Here is my lady, Ma'am," &s;aid the man.</P>
<P>"I looked up:&mdash;it was my Emily, my
long lo&s;t, lamented Emily! I gave a faint
&s;hriek, and hardly heard her in a low and
tremulous voice articulate&mdash;"My &s;i&s;ter!
"my &s;i&s;ter Sophy!"</P>
<P>"Not quite in my &s;en&s;es when I left
my lodgings, this interview quite robbed
me of them. I caught hold of the door of
the carriage, or I &s;hould have fallen in the
&s;treet. Every object &s;wam before me; and
I retained only recollection enough to cry,
"My child! my child! &s;ave my child!"
and to hear Emily repeat&mdash;"What child?
"what can I do for you? Good Heaven!
what can I do for you?" But I was unable
to an&s;wer. I found my&s;elf, however, in
<PB N="294" REF="296">
a few moments, placed in the carriage, and
Emily holding her &s;alts to my no&s;e, and
chafing my temples. When my &s;en&s;es
returned, my child was their fir&s;t object;
and again I exclaimed&mdash;"Oh! do not, do
not detain me; I mu&s;t go to &s;ave my
child&mdash;my poor little boy!"</P>
<P>"My dear, dear &s;i&s;ter," cried Emily,
pray &s;ummons your recollection, and tell
me whither you would go; we will drive
"to the place directly." In my anxiety
for the life of my infant; I forgot the
culpable conduct of my &s;i&s;ter; and, telling
her where the phy&s;ician lived, &s;he gave
orders to her coachman to ha&s;ten thither
in&s;tantly. A &s;trange &s;tupor overwhelmed
me; I could not &s;peak till we came to the
door of the hou&s;e: I then looked out;
I would have flown out of the carriage.
He was not at home: but ju&s;t as we were
leaving the door, he drew up to it.</P>
<P>"Then my voice and recollection re|turned
to me. I be&s;ought him mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly
to go with me. He was that mo|ment
<PB N="295" REF="297">
come from his fir&s;t round of vi&s;its to
change his hor&s;es, and begged we would
wait a few moments: but Emily urged
him &s;o earne&s;tly to get into her carriage,
&s;aying &s;he would take him to my lodgings
and bring him back, that he could not
re&s;i&s;t her importunity. He went with us
then; and &s;o totally was my mind ab&s;orbed
in the danger of my child, that I heeded
not the &s;trange contra&s;t between my appear|ance
and the gay &s;plendour of my &s;i&s;ter; I
forgot what &s;he was, and almo&s;t who &s;he
was; and only enquired, when the phy|&s;ician
had &s;een my child, whether he
would live.</P>
<P>"I &s;aw by his looks his opinion to the
contrary; nor, indeed, did he attempt to
conceal it: but he be&s;ought me to attend
to my own health, and to that of my hu&s;|band;
gave directions about us all, and
departed with my &s;i&s;ter, refu&s;ing the fee I
offered him, and telling me he would
come again early the next day.</P>
<P>"Elphin&s;tone, amazed as he was at
<PB N="296" REF="298">
the &s;cene that had pa&s;&s;ed, had no power to
enquire the meaning of it, and I had none
to explain it: all my re&s;olution was rou&s;ed
to attend my dying infant; but all could
not &s;ave him&mdash;he died: and I now tell it
with dry eyes, though, when it be&s;el me, I
thought no blow could be &s;o &s;evere, and
that I could not &s;urvive it:
<Q><L>For &s;ince the birth of Cain, the fir&s;t male child,</L>
<L>To him that did but ye&s;terday &s;u&s;pire</L>
<L>Never was &s;uch a gracious creature born!</L></Q></P>
<P>"Yet I have lived now above ten years
longer, my dear Mi&s;s De Mornay; and
have learned that there are &s;uch evils in
life as make an early death a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>"I was delirious, I know not how long,
between the exce&s;s of my affliction and the
opiates that were given me to deliver me
awhile from the &s;en&s;e of my mi&s;ery. In
the mean time my &s;i&s;ter &s;ent a careful per|&s;on
to attend me, and &s;aw me every day
her&s;elf, though I no longer knew her, or
<PB N="297" REF="299">
any body but Elphin&s;tone, who&s;e hand I
held for hours, imploring him not to let
them take my child from me. Emily did
yet more: &s;he &s;upplied us with every thing
we wanted, attended her&s;elf to the funeral
of my poor baby, and then took lodgings
for us at Ken&s;ington, that we might be re|moved
from the place where we had &s;uf|fered
&s;o much calamity. In her frequent
vi&s;its &s;he &s;poke not either to Elphin&s;tone
or Frank, unle&s;s they fir&s;t &s;poke to her;
and never but on the &s;ubjects of my health
and ea&s;e. I was not yet quite re&s;tored to
my &s;en&s;es when we removed. She &s;ent us,
by a porter, the next day, a forty pound
note, with the&s;e words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

</LETTER>
<P>"As &s;oon as I was capable of reading
and under&s;tanding this, all that had pa&s;&s;ed
came back to my recollection. I had been
&s;upported, then, for many days, by the
wages of &s;hame; and now had nothing
but a gift from the &s;ame hand, to &s;ave my
hu&s;band, my brother, and my&s;elf, from
actual hunger. "Oh! my dear father,"
cried I, "can you forgive your unfortunate
child; or rather, your unfortunate chil|dren!
and ought I to refu&s;e taking this
lovely lo&s;t one, who&s;e heart, &s;o generous,
&s;o full of &s;en&s;ibility, cannot &s;urely be
quite hardened in a cour&s;e of evil!"&mdash;I
&s;hall tire you, my dear Madam, if I am &s;o
minute: &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that I &s;aw my
&s;i&s;ter; that &s;he owned all her guilt, and all
<PB N="299" REF="301">
her folly; without having the power, or, at
that time, perhaps, the wi&s;h, to quit a man|ner
of life, where &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed boundle&s;s
&s;plendour and luxury, for &s;uch a preca|rious
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence as women can earn in bu|&s;ine&s;s.
My remon&s;trances &s;he heard with
gentlene&s;s, and mingled her tears with
mine: but &s;he pleaded gratitude to the
friend who &s;upported her, and the impo&s;&s;ibility
of her abandoning him, or exi&s;ting if
&s;he did. I was afraid of enquiring who
this was; but I found that it was &s;ome
man of high rank who had taken her from
the worthle&s;s Beresford, and with whom
&s;he had lived ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>"Her purpo&s;e &s;eemed to be to detach
my thoughts as much as po&s;&s;ible from her
&s;ituation, and to fix them on my own: and
indeed it was very nece&s;&s;ary; for we had
now, in con&s;equence of Elphin&s;tone's long
illne&s;s, no &s;upport whatever but what her
tenderne&s;s afforded us.</P>
<P>"As Elphin&s;tone recovered his health,
his &s;anguine temper returned, and again
<PB N="300" REF="302">
he formed various projects of entering into
bu&s;ine&s;s. It was now the mid&s;t of the
American troubles; and &s;ome part of my
father's property, which was thought reco|verable,
was there. Elphin&s;tone, who now
from long habit and from his natural di&s;po|&s;ition,
was become un&s;ettled and fond of
&s;peculative &s;chemes, propo&s;ed to the credi|tors
to go over there in &s;earch of the&s;e &s;ums.
I was &s;till too ill and too much depre&s;&s;ed by
pa&s;t &s;ufferings to give very minute atten|tion
to this plan: I only re&s;olved not to be
left behind, but to &s;hare his de&s;tiny what|ever
it might be. In a fortnight or three
weeks he was every day in town, and the
latter part of that time returned in remark|ably
gay &s;pirits, and told me of I know
not what pro&s;pects that were opening to
him; to which, indifferent to every thing
beyond a mere &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, now that I had
lo&s;t my boy, and long accu&s;tomed to hear
of vi&s;ionary fortune, I gave very little ap|plau&s;e,
till he came home one day elated
beyond what I had ever &s;een before, and
<PB N="301" REF="303">
told me that an offer had that day been
made him to become a &s;ort of under &s;ecre|tary
to a man high in admini&s;tration, into
who&s;e hou&s;e he was to be taken; that he
was to enter on his place the following
week, had taken a lodging for me in the
neighbourhood, and hired two female &s;er|vants
and a footman to attend.</P>
<P>"I wondered at, and rather blamed his
precipitancy; but he a&s;&s;ured me he was
right. Frank went with us, as he was to
be a &s;ort of &s;ecretary, in his turn, to El|phin&s;tone,
who was now dome&s;ticated with
his patron, while my brother and I were in
very hand&s;ome lodgings in We&s;tmin&s;ter.
I do not know by what means the money
came, but from this time it was as plen|ty
with Elphin&s;tone as it had before been
&s;carce. In a few months his views were &s;o
much enlarged that he took a hou&s;e for me,
increa&s;ed the number of his &s;ervants, and
from one thing to another our e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
was at length on a footing of &s;plen|dour,
again&s;t which I remon&s;trated in vain.
<PB N="302" REF="304">
He a&s;&s;ured me that his future &s;ucce&s;s
depended on his keeping up &s;uch an ap|pearance;
that the emoluments of his
place fully entitled him to it; and that
I &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee him permanently fixed
in a &s;ituation, &s;uch as would put us out
of the power of fortune.</P>
<P>"In the mean time, as I never loved
London, and as my health was very much
hurt by a long continuance in it, I pre|vailed
on him to let me have a &s;mall hou&s;e
at Shene, near Richmond, where it would
not be nece&s;&s;ary, for me at lea&s;t, to be
always in company, which began to be
unavoidable in London. To this propo|&s;al
he con&s;ented at fir&s;t with reluctance;
but afterwards, I thought he was not &s;orry
to have his hou&s;e in town at liberty to
receive the parties he now made there, by
which it became di&s;tingui&s;hed for good
cheer and high living. I had by this
time two boys; one of whom I have &s;ince
lo&s;t, and the other is the elde&s;t of the&s;e:
and with many a &s;ilent and &s;ti&s;led &s;igh I
<PB N="303" REF="305">
wi&s;hed their father would think, while
in this pro&s;perous train of fortune, of
making &s;ome provi&s;ion for his increa&s;ing
family.</P>
<P>"He heard me always with his u&s;ual
good temper, and as con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ured me
that he was laying by money every year;
though I never could gue&s;s how or from
whence it came.</P>
<P>"Frank, however, was not only &s;up|ported
like a gentleman, but had really
more money than, had he been le&s;s pru|dent
and &s;teady, would have been proper
for &s;o young a man.</P>
<P>"Of this, notwith&s;tanding the infec|tious
example of the people among whom
he lived, and even of Elphin&s;tone him&s;elf,
he always brought a part to me to put by
for him. On the&s;e occa&s;ions I &s;ometimes
que&s;tioned him of their manner of life in
London, whence I now entirely ab&s;ented
my&s;elf; and though he gave me &s;uch
an&s;wers as would, he thought, prevent
my inquietude, he was too ingenuous to
<PB N="304" REF="306">
be able to conceal the whole truth. Thus
my pro&s;perity was embittered by the fear of
falling again into the adver&s;ity, from which
we had been delivered by miracle; and I
lived in perpetual dread of evils I had no
power to prevent. Alas! the greate&s;t evil
was already arrived&mdash;the e&s;trangement of
Elphin&s;tone's heart!&mdash;I &s;aw it in a thou|&s;and
in&s;tances; but I knew that reproaches
and importunity would not recal it; and I
endeavoured, whenever he came down to
Shene, to appear cheerful, le&s;t he &s;hould
be quite won from me by tho&s;e whom he
now frequented.</P>
<P>"Though he has an excellent under|&s;tanding,
he became in&s;en&s;ibly intoxicated
with his good fortune, and never gave
him&s;elf time to think how &s;oon it might
be at an end, till this fatal period actually
arrived. His patron was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from
his employment, and the golden dream
vani&s;hed at once.</P>
<P>"I then knew, that out of immen&s;e
&s;ums of money he had made, by means, of
<PB N="305" REF="307">
which I under&s;tand nothing, he had not
re&s;erved five hundred pounds; and I knew
that a mi&s;tre&s;s whom he had &s;upported in
great &s;plendour, had pillaged him of twenty
times that &s;um. But he was now hum|bled
and unhappy! I forgave all his fail|ings;
and &s;hould have ble&s;&s;ed the chance
that had re&s;tored him to me, had we but
had a competence to live upon.</P>
<P>"After all our plate and fine furniture
in London was &s;old, and our debts called
in, we found our&s;elves about two hundred
pounds wor&s;e than nothing. But Elphin|&s;tone
&s;till told me he had friends; and now
commenced a cour&s;e of folicitation and
attendance, to which the humble&s;t and
&s;evere&s;t labour is in my mind infinitely
preferable: and in the mean time our
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence was derived from his writing
for the papers, and now and then by
an eighteen-penny political pamphlet.</P>
<P>"I did not notice, that in the height
of our pro&s;perity my brother John a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly
courted our regard; and Elphin|&s;tone
<PB N="306" REF="308">
had procured him many advantages:
among others, that of being &s;teward to
a nobleman, by whom he made a great
deal of money; &s;o that he was, on our de|cline,
more pro&s;perous than ever. With
our failure, however, his love failed al&s;o;
and all we could now obtain of him was,
to take Frank as a &s;ort of a&s;&s;i&s;tant into his
bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"My poor Emily, who from gratitude
and pity I could never wholly for&s;ake, was
at this time abroad with her friend; and I
had nothing to &s;upport me again&s;t the
heavy tide of adver&s;ity but the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
of having done my duty, and the firm
reliance on heaven which that con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
gave me. Four years we lingered on,
&s;ometimes flattered by hope of &s;ome tri|fling
place, and &s;ometimes &s;upported by
&s;mall remittances from Elphin&s;tone's mo|ther;
while &s;he complained heavily of the
conduct of her elde&s;t &s;on, who had de|prived
her and his &s;i&s;ters of every thing he
could take from them.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="309">
"Oh! never may tho&s;e who have it in
their power to &s;ecure an independance,
fooli&s;hly throw it away, and tru&s;t to the fal|lacious
a&s;&s;urances of that friend&s;hip which
flouri&s;hes only in the &s;un&s;hine of affluence!</P>
<P>"Day after day did poor Elphin&s;tone
now attend tho&s;e men, who but a few
months ago were his a&s;&s;iduous friends:
many, into who&s;e pockets he had been the
means of putting thou&s;ands, now &s;hut their
doors again&s;t him; while, of tho&s;e who could
not &s;o ea&s;ily e&s;cape from his importunity,
&s;ome blamed him for the expence at
which he had lived, talked of the ad|vantages
of oeconomy, and of the de|mands
of their own family&mdash;others very
gravely harangued on the caprice of for|tune,
the ups and downs of the world,
thanked God they had but a little, but
that little was, they hoped, &s;ecure; yet
mo&s;t truly lamented that it was <HI>too</HI> little to
enable them to follow the warm dictates of
their hearts, in aiding a friend they &s;o
much re&s;pected and e&s;teemed; and with
<PB N="308" REF="310">
this &s;ort of language bowed <HI>him</HI> out, who&s;e
favour and recommendation they had only
a few months before &s;olicited with mean|ne&s;s
equal to their pre&s;ent ingratitude.</P>
<P>"Wearied at length by this &s;ad ex|perience
of a world to which he was &s;till
too much attached, and where, from the
vivacity of his &s;anguine temper, he was
long unwilling to relinqui&s;h the hope of
ri&s;ing again into con&s;ideration, he took up
once more his old projects of recovering the
money due to his father in America: and
though that country was no longer under
the government of Britain, and his ex|pectations
of &s;ucce&s;s greatly dimini&s;hed,
he contrived to per&s;uade tho&s;e per&s;ons
who were intere&s;ted, to furni&s;h him with a
&s;mall &s;upply of money; and we went, a
wandering and unhappy family, to Ame|rica.</P>
<P>"I could give you, my dear Mi&s;s
De Mornay, a long detail of our pilgrim|age&mdash;of
our being once fixed on a farm
in the back &s;ettlements, and expo&s;ed to
<PB N="309" REF="311">
terrors from the Indians, which, with all
my courage, it was utterly out of my
power to &s;upport; but I have already
been too prolix, and tired you with a
long hi&s;tory of &s;orrow, from which your
&s;en&s;ible heart requires &s;ome relief.</P>
<P>"Alas! I cannot give it you while
I dwell on my own &s;ad &s;tory; I will there|fore,
as briefly as I can, conclude it,
by telling you that we were four years in
America, and two in Antigua; where my
hu&s;band joined his own family, and tried
to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf as a merchant. But
he was, by this time, con&s;idered as a
&s;chemer&mdash;as an unlucky man&mdash;as one not
born to be pro&s;perous; and this de&s;ign
ended, like the re&s;t, in di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>"I have obtained, however, &s;ome ad|vantages
by my itinerant life; I have
learned re&s;ignation, and have &s;een, that
almo&s;t every condition of humanity has
evils equal to mine, though I have &s;ome|times
thought them in&s;upportable. But
in acquiring patience, hope, I own, has
e&s;caped me: nor have I now any other
<PB N="310" REF="312">
wi&s;h, than to &s;ee my children well, and to
be able to find them bread.</P>
<P>"The di&s;tinctions of rank have long
&s;ince too been lo&s;t to me, who have pa&s;&s;ed
from competence to extreme poverty, from
extreme poverty to high affluence, and
have again fallen to all the mi&s;eries of
dependence and indigence. When Frank,
therefore, fir&s;t declared to me his attach|ment
to Je&s;&s;y Woodburn, I oppo&s;ed his
marriage, not from pride, but from the
apprehen&s;ion of redoubling his difficulties.
I then, it is true, depended almo&s;t entirely
on the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that excellent
brother; but, believe me, that would never
have induced me to oppo&s;e what was
requi&s;ite to his happine&s;s. I had not
known Je&s;&s;y long before I lo&s;t every idea
of oppo&s;ition to it, and I wi&s;hed to &s;ee
them married long before I knew what
favourable pro&s;pects might one day open
to the object of his affection. To fore&s;ee
to whom &s;he would owe the realizing tho&s;e
pro&s;pects, to whom &s;he would afterwards
<PB N="311" REF="313">
be the means of my being known, was,
you know, impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"And where, my dear Madam," en|quired
Cele&s;tina, "where was Mr. Elphin|&s;tone
at the time you &s;peak of?"</P>
<P>"He was gone again to Antigua, on ac|count
of his mother's death. I was left with
four children, and &s;o little money, that
heaven only knows what would have
become of them and of me, had it
not been for Frank."</P>
<P>"And your &s;i&s;ter Emily!&mdash;I cannot help
being intere&s;ted for her with all her
failings."</P>
<P>"Ah! would to heaven I knew what
was now her lot! I lo&s;t all traces of her
after my going to America; nor could
mine or Frank's mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous enquiries
ever &s;ince, gain any intelligence. She
has changed her name, or taken &s;ome
other means to avoid us; circum&s;tances
that make me fear &s;he is &s;unk below her
former brilliant but di&s;creditable and de|&s;tructive
condition. When I think of
<PB N="312" REF="314">
her and of my children, my &s;toici&s;m
for&s;akes me&mdash;and of her, unle&s;s I could
&s;natch her from a manner of life &s;o
terrible, I endeavour not to think; for
the thoughts of what &s;he is, and of what
&s;he may be, I am very frequently unable
to bear. You will allow, my dear Mi&s;s De
Mornay, that my own &s;ituation requires
all my courage. A new and perhaps an
abortive project now carries me to the
remote&s;t part of Scotland&mdash;with a heart,
I hope not callous, but exhau&s;ted by
long &s;uffering. My hu&s;band is amiable,
good tempered, and, I believe, truly at|tached
to me; but he is &s;o volatile!
&s;o un&s;teady! misfortune has made him
re&s;tle&s;s, and his de&s;ultory life encrea&s;ed
the original blemi&s;h of his temper&mdash;a
want of firmne&s;s; from which have ari&s;en
&s;ome of the evils that have pur&s;ued us.</P>
<P>"One of his &s;ome-time friends procured
him the little appointment he now holds,
rather to get rid of his importunity, I
think, than to do him real &s;ervice. It
<PB N="313" REF="315">
may, however, afford us a re&s;idence and a
&s;upport, and I need not &s;ay that its di&s;|tance
from the &s;cene of our former pro&s;|perity
and former adver&s;ity is to me its
greate&s;t recommendation. If my hu&s;band
can learn to be content among the cold
and dreary Hebrides, if my children have
there health, food, and &s;helter, never &s;hall I
be heard to repine; and indeed my journey,
in having you for my companion, begins
under au&s;pices &s;o favourable, that my heart,
dead to hope as it has long been, is yet not
in&s;en&s;ible of &s;omething that nearly re&s;em|bles
it."</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation brought the travellers
to the end of their third day's &s;tage; and
Cele&s;tina, more than ever intere&s;ted for Mrs.
Elphin&s;tone, forgot for a moment every
thing but the &s;eries of unde&s;erved calami|ties
to which &s;he had been li&s;tening.</P>
