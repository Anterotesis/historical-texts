<HEAD>To the Right Honourable GEORGE GRANVILLE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Secretary at War.</HEAD>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<P>AN Addre&s;s of this Nature made upon your Advancement to one of the principal Employ|ments of the State, and made by one who has had the Honour to be known to you &s;o many Years, might be pretended by malicious People to be a Homage rather to your Fortune and Pow|er, than a due Re&s;pect to your Merit and Vertue; if it were not publickly known, that I formerly applied my &s;elf to you in the &s;ame manner, when you were
<PB REF="3">
much more di&s;tingni&s;hed by Merit and Vertue, than by Fortune and Power.</P>
<P>But if any one farther maliciou&s;ly ur|ges, that, even when I formerly applied my &s;elf to you, by the di&s;tingui&s;hing Qualities of your Mind and Per&s;on, I fore&s;aw your Fortune and Power; to him I an&s;wer, in order to vindicate the Reputation of my Sincerity and my Di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s, that tho' I &s;aw very well that tho&s;e great Qualities fitted Mr. <HI>Gran|ville</HI> for the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Employ|ments; yet who could have ever ima|gin'd that any Man living had Merit e|nough to rai&s;e him in &s;pight of &s;o many unfortunate Vertues with which that Me|rit was attended, in &s;pight of not only a true Poetical Genius, but a Frankne&s;s, a Probity, a matchle&s;s Integrity, a Sin|cerity worthy of Heroick Times, and a mo&s;t untainted Honour.</P>
<P>But tho' your Character were le&s;s con|&s;picuous, and what I had formerly done were intirely forgot, the numerous and
<PB REF="4">
powerful Obligations I have to you, would more than ju&s;tifie this Addre&s;s; and the omitting the fir&s;t Opportunity of making you a publick Acknowledgment would look like black Ingratitude. You have taken &s;uch Care of my Intere&s;t with others at a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable Conjun|cture, and have your &s;elf made me a Pre&s;ent &s;o noble, and &s;o extraordinary at a time when I &s;tood mo&s;t in need of it, that how few alive have Spirit and Magnanimity to do any thing like it? At lea&s;t I defie any one to name that living Man, who in a private Ca|pacity has done any thing like it.</P>
<P>I know very well indeed that you are very far from de&s;iring &s;uch a publick Acknowledgment, that you aim at no|thing by doing daily good, but the God|like Plea&s;ure which re&s;ults from your Actions; and that others perhaps may cen&s;ure me for &s;acrificing your Mode&s;ty to my own Vanity. For to publi&s;h to the World that I have been oblig'd in
<PB REF="5">
an extraordinary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> by a Per&s;on &s;o univer&s;ally e&s;teem'd and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tingui&s;h'd, that one of the very few Things in which the mo&s;t violent of both Parties agree, is the Character of Mr. <HI>Gran|ville,</HI> will be thought to be the Re&s;ult of uncommon Vanity, by tho&s;e who have not Goodne&s;s enough to believe it to be the Effect of a lively Gratitude.</P>
<P>But tho', Sir, I had no Obligation to you, and you had no other Merit but that of perfectly under&s;tanding an Art which you have perfectly practis'd, <HI>viz.</HI> the Art which is the Subject of the following Treati&s;e, that Treati&s;e would be by Right of Nature yours. For to whom can an E&s;&s;ay upon the Genius and Writings of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> be &s;o pro|perly addre&s;s'd, as to him who be&s;t un|der&s;tands <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and who has mo&s;t improv'd him. I would not give this ju&s;t Encomium to the <HI>Jew of Venice,</HI> if I were not convinc'd from a long Ex|perience of the Penetration and Force of
<PB REF="6">
your Judgment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> no Exaltation can make you a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">m'd of your former noble Art; that you know it to be a Weak|ne&s;s barely to imagine, that the mo&s;t no|ble and mo&s;t exalted of all Arts, and the mo&s;t difficult to excel in, can render a Man le&s;s qualified for publick Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or for the fir&s;t Employments of the State; that all the great State&s;men who have be&s;t &s;ucceeded in Affairs of Government, have either writ Poems or Treati&s;es concerning Poetry. The mo&s;t ancient of Hi&s;torians and Legi&s;lators, <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> at lea&s;t of tho&s;e who&s;e Laws and Hi&s;tories remain, has given us a pathetick and a lofty Poem upon the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Athenian</HI> Legi&s;lator <HI>Solon</HI> thought it not in the lea&s;t below his Dignity to render Moral Vertue lovely by the Charms of Ver&s;e. And <HI>Lacedemonian Licur|gus,</HI> even the rigid and the au&s;tere <HI>Ly|curgus,</HI> thought it an Employment wor|thy of his Wi&s;dom and Vertue, to re|&s;tore
<PB REF="7">
and publi&s;h the Immortal Works of <HI>Homer:</HI> Having the &s;ame Opinion of that Prince of Poets that <HI>Horace</HI> after|wards had; that his Poems would bet|ter in&s;truct Mankind in Vertue than they could be po&s;&s;ibly taught by Pro&s;e. The mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Writers of Politicks a|mong the <HI>Grecians, Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>; one of them had a figurative, a lofty and a Poetick Pro&s;e; and the other, who may be call'd the Legi&s;lator of <HI>Parna&s;|&s;us,</HI> wrote the Laws of Tragedy &s;o ex|actly and &s;o truly in Rea&s;on and Nature, that &s;ucceeding Criticks have writ ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably upon that Art no farther than they have adhered to their great Ma&s;ter's Notions. <HI>Tacitus</HI> the very O|racle of Modern State&s;men has a Stile that is warm and daring, and figura|tive, that is to &s;ay Poetick. <HI>Machia|vel</HI> the Prince of Modern Politicians, if we except but one of our own Country|men, wrote more than one Comedy, and more than one Poem has been attempted by
<PB REF="8">
our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Politician <HI>Harrington.</HI> The two Princes of Poets may ea&s;ily be pro|ved to've been great State&s;men; <HI>Homer</HI> particularly made choice of a Moral, which in his Time, when <HI>Greece</HI> with the I&s;lands of the <HI>Aegaean</HI> was divided into petty Sovereignties, was the funda|mental Maxim of their Politicks and their true Intere&s;t; which Moral was, as <HI>Sal|lu&s;t</HI> afterwards expre&s;s'd it, <HI>Concordi&acirc; res parvae cre&s;cunt, Di&s;cordi&acirc; maxima dilabuntur</HI>; from who&s;e noble&s;t Poem you formerly gave us a Tragedy, in which in Imitation of <HI>Homer,</HI> you are daring yet ju&s;t, fiery yet regular, &s;ublime yet natu|ral and per&s;picuous, cha&s;t yet alluring, and ea&s;ie yet &s;trong and powerful.</P>
<P>But to come to the more active part of Government, the greate&s;t Monarchs and Captains, and Mini&s;ters of State that ever were known in the World, either were or would have been great Poets. When <HI>Athens</HI> flouri&s;h'd in all her Glory, their Poets and their famous Writers
<PB REF="9">
were they who directed their Coun&s;els, and led their Armies to Battel. <HI>Alex|ander</HI> read nothing but the Works of <HI>Ho|mer</HI> while he conquer'd the Orient. In <HI>Rome</HI> the greate&s;t Captain that flouri&s;h'd in the Time of the Commonwealth vouch|&s;afed his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to a Comick Poet: And the two fir&s;t <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> were proud to write Tragedies with tho&s;e fatal Hands that were victorious over the Univer&s;e. <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> at the Time that he was fir&s;t Mini&s;ter to the Emperor of the World, was not only the greate&s;t Patron of the Mu&s;es that ever was, but endeavour'd to be him&s;elf a Poet. If we de&s;cend to Mo|dern Times, <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who laid the Foun|dation of the <HI>French</HI> Greatne&s;s, wrote more than one Dramatick Poem, with that very right Hand which dictated to the Cabinets of &s;o many Sovereign Prin|ces, and directed the &s;ucce&s;sful Motions of &s;o many conquering Commanders. And that Greatne&s;s, which upon a <HI>French</HI> Po|etick Foundation was in the Space of le&s;s
<PB REF="10">
than one Century rais'd to an in&s;upporta|ble Height, was in le&s;s than twenty Years &s;app'd and undermin'd, and overturn'd by a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Poetick Mini&s;try: It being undeniable, that &s;everal of the Per&s;ons who made the chief Figures in both the old and the new Mini&s;try were Poets. I make no doubt, Sir, but the Time will come when you will be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Wi&s;dom and Reach of your Coun&s;els, as much as you were formerly by the Spi|rit and Ju&s;tne&s;s of your Writings. For the very Vertues which we once were a|fraid would hinder your Advancement even in the mo&s;t vertuous Court, are now like to pre&s;erve and &s;upport your Intere&s;t &s;ince you have had an Opportunity of pub|lickly practi&s;ing them &s;o long. 'Tis im|po&s;&s;ible to behold that Ardor, that Since|rity and that Alacrity, with which you every Day endeavour to do good to your Fellow-Creatures, without loving you, and without wi&s;hing, as well as hoping, that you may be the peculiar Care of Provi|dence,
<PB REF="11">
which by advancing you to one of the mo&s;t eminent Stations would provide for Thou&s;ands. But when we behold that Ardor and that Alacrity, attended with &s;uch an attractive Sweetne&s;s and &s;uch a manly Grace, and with a Nobility which God and Nature &s;eem to have imprinted both on your Mind and Per&s;on, we have no longer Power over our &s;elves, but give up all our Affections to you; and not only wi&s;h, but firmly believe that &s;ince God and Nature have given you tho&s;e &s;everal Excellencies which were the undoubted O|riginal of all Political Nobility, they have determin'd you to &s;ucceed to the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive Fortunes and Titles of your Noble Ance&s;tors; which is warmly de&s;ir'd and earne&s;tly expected by all who have the Ho|nour to know you, but more e&s;pecially by </P>

<HEAD>On the Genius and Writings of <HI>Shake|&s;pear.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Feb. 1. 1710/11.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here &s;end you the Tragedy of <HI>Coriola|nus,</HI> which I have alter'd from the Ori|ginal of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and with it a &s;hort Account of the Genius and Writings of that Author, both which you de&s;ired me to &s;end to you the la&s;t time I had the good For|tune to &s;ee you. But I &s;end them both upon this condition, that you will with your u&s;ual Sincerity tell me your Sentiments both of the Poem and of the Critici&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was one of the greate&s;t Ge|nius's that the World e'er &s;aw for the Tra|gick Stage. Tho'he lay under greater Di&s;|advantages
<PB N="2" REF="13">
than any of his Succe&s;&s;ors, yet had he greater and more genuine Beauties than the be&s;t and greate&s;t of them. And what makes the brighte&s;t Glory of his Cha|racter, tho&s;e Beauties were entirely his own, and owing to the Force of his own Nature; whereas his Faults were owing to his Edu|cation, and to the Age that he liv'd in. One may &s;ay of him as they did of <HI>Homer,</HI> that he had none to imitate, and is him&s;elf inimi|table. His Imaginations were often as ju&s;t, as they were bold and &s;trong. He had a na|tural Di&s;cretion which never cou'd have been taught him, and his Judgment was &s;trong and penetrating. He &s;eems to have wanted nothing but Time and Lei&s;ure for Thought, to have found out tho&s;e Rules of which he appears &s;o ignorant. His Characters are al|ways drawn ju&s;tly, exactly, graphically, ex|cept where he fail'd by not knowing Hi&s;tory or the Poetical Art. He has for the mo&s;t part more fairly di&s;tingui&s;h'd them than any of his Succe&s;&s;ors have done, who have fal|&s;ified them, or confounded them, by making Love the predominant Quality in all. He had &s;o fine a Talent for touching the Pa&s;&s;ions, and they are &s;o lively in him, and &s;o truly in Nature, that they often touch us more without their due Preparations, than tho&s;e of other Tragick Poets, who have all the Beauty of De&s;ign and all the Advantage of
<PB N="3" REF="14">
Incidents. His Ma&s;ter-Pa&s;&s;ion was Terror, which he has often mov'd &s;o powerfully and &s;o wonderfully, that we may ju&s;tly con|clude, that if he had had the Advantage of Art and Learning, he wou'd have &s;urpa&s;s'd the very be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of the Ancients. His Paintings are often &s;o beautiful and &s;o lively, &s;o graceful and &s;o powerful, e&s;peci|ally where he u&s;es them in order to move Terror; that there is nothing perhaps more accompli&s;h'd in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poetry. His Sen|timents for the mo&s;t part in his be&s;t Trage|dies, are noble, generous, ea&s;ie and natural, and adapted to the Per&s;ons who u&s;e them. His Expre&s;&s;ion is in many Places good and pure after a hundred Years; &s;imple tho' ele|vated, graceful tho' bold, and ea&s;y tho' &s;trong. He &s;eems to have been the very Original of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tragical Harmony; that is the Harmony of Blank Ver&s;e, diver&s;i|fyed often by Di&s;&s;yllable and Tri&s;&s;yllable Ter|minations. For that Diver&s;ity di&s;tingui&s;hes it from Heroick Harmony, and bringing it nearer to common U&s;e, makes it more pro|per to gain Attention, and more fit for Action and Dialogue. Such Ver&s;e we make when we are writing Pro&s;e; we make &s;uch Ver&s;e in common Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>If <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had the&s;e great Qualities by Nature, what would he not have been, if he had join'd to &s;o happy a Genius Learning
<PB N="4" REF="15">
and the Poetical Art. For want of the lat|ter our Author has &s;ometimes made gro&s;s Mi&s;takes in the Characters which he has drawn from Hi&s;tory, again&s;t the Equality and Conveniency of Manners of his Drama|tical Per&s;ons. Witne&s;s <HI>Menenius</HI> in the fol|lowing Tragedy, whom he has made an er|rant Buffoon, which is a great Ab&s;urdity. For he might as well have imagin'd a grave maje&s;tick <HI>Jack-Pudding,</HI> as a Buffoon in a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator. <HI>Aufidius</HI> the General of the <HI>Vol&s;cians</HI> is &s;hewn a ba&s;e and a profligate Villain. He has offended again&s;t the Equa|lity of the Manners even in his Hero him|&s;elf. For <HI>Coriolanus</HI> who in the fir&s;t part of the Tragedy is &s;hewn &s;o open, &s;o frank, &s;o violent, and &s;o magnanimous, is repre&s;ented in the latter part by <HI>Aufidius</HI> which is con|tradicted by no one, a flattering, fawning, cringing, in&s;inuating Traytor.</P>
<P>For want of this Poetical Art, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has introduced things into his Tragedies, which are again&s;t the Dignity of that noble Poem, as the Rabble in <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and that in <HI>Coriolanus</HI>; tho' that in <HI>Coriolanus</HI> of|fends not only again&s;t the Dignity of Trage|dy, but again&s;t the Truth of Hi&s;tory like|wi&s;e, and the Cu&s;toms of Ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Roman</HI> People, as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;hew anon.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="16">
For want of this Art, he has made his Incidents le&s;s moving, le&s;s &s;urprizing, and le&s;s wonderful. He has been &s;o far from &s;eeking tho&s;e fine Occa&s;ions to move with which an Action furni&s;h'd according to Art would have furni&s;h'd him; that he &s;eems rather to have indu&s;triou&s;ly avoi|ded them. He makes <HI>Coriolanus</HI> upon his Sentence of Bani&s;hment, take his leave of his Wife and his Mother out of &s;ight of the Audience, and &s;o has purpo&s;ely as it were avoided a great occa&s;ion to move.</P>
<P>If we are willing to allow, that <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> by &s;ticking to the bare Events of Hi&s;to|ry, has mov'd more than any of his Succe&s;|&s;ors, yet his ju&s;t Admirers mu&s;t confe&s;s, that if he had had the Poetical Art, he would have mov'd ten times more. For 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that by a bare Hi&s;torical Play he could move &s;o much as he would have done by a Fable.</P>
<P>We find that a Romance entertains the ge|nerality of Mankind with more Satisfaction than Hi&s;tory, if they read only to be enter|tertain'd; but if they read Hi&s;tory thro' Pride or Ambition, they bring their Pa&s;&s;ions along with them, and that alters the ca&s;e. Nothing is more plain than that even in an Hi&s;torical Relation &s;ome Parts of it, and &s;ome Events, plea&s;e more than others. And there|fore a Man of Judgment, who &s;ees why they
<PB N="6" REF="17">
do &s;o, may in forming a Fable, and di&s;po|&s;ing an Action, plea&s;e more than an Hi&s;to|rian can do. For the ju&s;t Fiction of a Fable moves us more than an Hi&s;torical Relation can do for the two following Rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t by rea&s;on of the Communication and mutual Dependence of its Parts. For if Pa&s;&s;ion &s;prings from Motion, then the Ob&s;truction of that Motion or a counter Motion mu&s;t ob&s;truct and check the Pa&s;&s;ion: And there|fore an Hi&s;torian and a Writer of Hi&s;torical Plays pa&s;&s;ing from Events of one nature to Events of another nature without a due Pre|paration, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;tifle and confound one Pa&s;&s;ion by another. The &s;econd Rea|&s;on why the Fiction of a Fable plea&s;es us more, than an Hi&s;torical Relation can do, is, becau&s;e in an Hi&s;torical Relation we &s;el|dom are acquainted with the true Cau&s;es of Events, whereas in a feign'd Action which is duly con&s;tituted, that is, which has a ju&s;t beginning, tho&s;e Cau&s;es always appear. For 'tis ob&s;ervable, that both in a Poetical Fiction and an Hi&s;torical Relation, tho&s;e E|vents are the mo&s;t entertaining, the mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing, and the mo&s;t wonderful, in which Providence mo&s;t plainly appears. And 'tis for this Rea&s;on that the Author of a ju&s;t Fable, mu&s;t plea&s;e more than the Writer of an Hi&s;torical Relation. The Good mu&s;t ne|ver fail to pro&s;per, and the Bad mu&s;t be al|ways
<PB N="7" REF="18">
puni&s;h'd: Otherwi&s;e the Incidents, and particularly the Cata&s;trophe which is the grand Incident, are liable to be imputed ra|ther to Chance, than to Almighty Conduct and to Sovereign Ju&s;tice. The want of this impartial Di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice makes the <HI>Coriolanus</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> to be without Mo|ral. 'Tis true indeed <HI>Coriolanus</HI> is kill'd by tho&s;e Foreign Enemies with whom he had openly &s;ided again&s;t his Country, which &s;eems to be an Event worthy of Providence, and would look as if it were contriv'd by in|finite Wi&s;dom, and executed by &s;upreme Ju&s;tice, to make <HI>Coriolanus</HI> a dreadful Exam|ple to all, who lead on Foreign Enemies to the Inva&s;ion of their native Country; if there were not &s;omething in the Fate of the other Characters, which gives occa&s;ion to doubt of it, and which &s;ugge&s;ts to the Scep|tical Reader that this might happen by acci|dent. For <HI>Aufidius</HI> the principal Murderer of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> who in cold Blood gets him a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by Ruffians, in&s;tead of leaving him to the Law of the Country, and the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Vol&s;cian</HI> Senate, and who com|mits &s;o black a Crime, not by any erroneous Zeal, or a mi&s;taken Publick Spirit, but thro' Jealou&s;y, Envy, and inveterate Malice; this A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inator not only &s;urvives, and &s;urvives unpuni&s;h'd, but &s;eems to be rewarded for &s;o dete&s;table an Action; by engro&s;&s;ing all tho&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="19">
Honours to him&s;elf which <HI>Coriolanus</HI> before had &s;har'd with him. But not only <HI>Aufidius,</HI> but the <HI>Roman</HI> Tribunes, <HI>Sicinius</HI> and <HI>Bru|tus,</HI> appear to me to cry aloud for Poetick Vengeance. For they are guilty of two Faults, neither of which ought to go unpu|ni&s;h'd: The fir&s;t in procuring the Bani&s;h|ment of <HI>Coriolanus.</HI> If they were really jea|lous, that <HI>Coriolanus</HI> had a De&s;ign on their Liberties, when he &s;tood for the Con&s;ul&s;hip, it was but ju&s;t that they &s;hould give him a Repul&s;e; but to get the Champion and De|fender of their Country bani&s;h'd upon a pre|tended Jealou&s;y was a great deal too much, and could proceed from nothing but that Ha|tred and Malice which they had conceiv'd again&s;t him, for oppo&s;ing their In&s;titution. Their &s;econd Fault lay in procuring this Sentence by indirect Methods, by exa&s;pera|ting and inflaming the People by Artifices and In&s;inuations, by taking a ba&s;e Advantage of the Open-heartedne&s;s and Violence of <HI>Corio|lanus,</HI> and by oppre&s;&s;ing him with a Sophi|&s;tical Argument, that he aim'd at Sovereign|ty, becau&s;e he had not deliver'd into the Publick Trea&s;ury the Spoils which he had taken from the <HI>Antiates.</HI> As if a De&s;ign of Sovereignty could be rea&s;onably concluded from any one Act; or any one could think of bringing to pa&s;s &s;uch a De&s;ign, by eter|nally favouring the Patricians, and di&s;obli|ging
<PB N="9" REF="20">
the Populace. For we need make no doubt, but that it was among the young Pa|tricians, that <HI>Coriolanus</HI> di&s;tributed the Spoils which were taken from the <HI>Antiates</HI>; where|as nothing but care&s;&s;ing the Populace could en&s;lave the <HI>Roman</HI> People, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> after|wards very well &s;aw and experienc'd. So that this Inju&s;tice of the Tribunes was the original Cau&s;e of the Calamity which after|wards befel their Country, by the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Vol&s;cians,</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Co|riolanus.</HI> And yet the&s;e Tribunes at the end of the Play like <HI>Aufidius</HI> remain unpuni&s;h'd. But indeed <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has been wanting in the exact Di&s;tribution of Poetical Ju&s;tice not only in his <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> but in mo&s;t of his be&s;t Tragedies, in which the Guilty and the Innocent peri&s;h promi&s;cuou&s;ly; as <HI>Duncan</HI> and <HI>Banquo</HI> in <HI>Mackbeth,</HI> as likewi&s;e Lady <HI>Mac|duffe</HI> and her Children; <HI>De&s;demona</HI> in <HI>Othel|lo</HI>; <HI>Cordelia, Kent,</HI> and King <HI>Lear,</HI> in the Tragedy that bears his Name; <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Porcia</HI> in <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and young <HI>Hamlet</HI> in the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet.</HI> For tho' it may be &s;aid in Defence of the la&s;t, that <HI>Hamlet</HI> had a De&s;ign to kill his Uncle who then reign'd; yet this is ju&s;tify'd by no le&s;s than a Call from Heaven, and rai&s;ing up one from the Dead to urge him to it. The Good and the Bad then peri&s;hing promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the be&s;t of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Tragedies, there can be ei|ther
<PB N="10" REF="21">
none or very weak In&s;truction in them: For &s;uch promi&s;cuous Events call the Go|vernment of Providence into Que&s;tion, and by Scepticks and Libertines are re&s;olv'd into Chance. I humbly conceive therefore that this want of Dramatical Ju&s;tice in the Tra|gedy of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> gave occa&s;ion for a ju&s;t Alteration, and that I was oblig'd to &s;acri|fice to that Ju&s;tice <HI>Aufidius</HI> and the Tribunes, as well as <HI>Coriolanus.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have we endeavour'd to &s;hew, that for want of the Poetical Art, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> lay under very great Di&s;advantages. At the &s;ame time we mu&s;t own to his Honour, that he has often perform'd Wonders without it, in &s;pight of the Judgment of &s;o great a Man as <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Natur&acirc; fieret Laudabile carmen an arte</L>
<L>Quae&s;itum e&s;t; ego nec &s;tudium &s;ine Divite vena?</L>
<L>Nec rude quid profit video Ingenium, alterius &s;ic</L>
<L>Altera po&s;cit opem res, &amp; conjurat amic&egrave;.</L></Q>
<P>But from this very Judgment of <HI>Horace</HI> we may ju&s;tly conclude, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> would have wonderfully &s;urpa&s;s'd him&s;elf, if Art had been join'd to Nature. There never was a greater Genius in the World than <HI>Virgil:</HI> He was one who &s;eems to have been born for this glorious End, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Mu&s;e might exert in him the utmo&s;t Force of her
<PB N="11" REF="22">
Poetry: And his admirable and divine Beau|ties are manife&s;tly owing to the happy Con|federacy of Art and Nature. It was Art that contriv'd that incomparable De&s;ign of the <HI>Aeneis,</HI> and it was Nature that executed it. Could the greate&s;t Genius that ever was in|fus'd into Earthly Mold by Heaven, if it had been unguided and una&s;&s;i&s;ted by Art, have taught him to make that noble and wonderful U&s;e of the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Tran&s;mi|gration, which he makes in the Sixth Book of his Poem? Had <HI>Virgil</HI> been a circular Poet, and clo&s;ely adher'd to Hi&s;tory, how could the <HI>Romans</HI> have been tran&s;ported with that inimitable Epi&s;ode of <HI>Dido,</HI> which brought a-fre&s;h into their Minds the <HI>Car|thaginian</HI> War, and the dreadful <HI>Hannibal?</HI> When 'tis evident that that admirable Epi|&s;ode is &s;o little owing to a faithful ob&s;er|vance of Hi&s;tory, and the exact order of Time, that 'tis deriv'd from a very bold but judicious Violation of the&s;e; it being un|deniable that <HI>Dido</HI> liv'd almo&s;t 300 Years after <HI>Aeneas.</HI> Yet is it that charming Epi|&s;ode that makes the chief Beauties of a third Part of the Poem. For the De&s;truction of <HI>Troy</HI> it &s;elf which is &s;o divinely related, is &s;till more admirable by the Effect it produ|ces, which is the Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dido.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould now proceed to &s;hew under what Di&s;advantages <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> lay for want of

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Feb. 6. 1710/11.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPON the Encouragement I have re|ceiv'd from you, I &s;hall proceed to &s;hew under what Di&s;advantages <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> lay for want of being conver&s;ant with the Ancients. But becau&s;e I have lately been in &s;ome Conver&s;ation, where they would not allow, but that he was acquainted with the Ancients, I &s;hall endeavour to make it appear that he was not; and the &s;hewing that in the Method in which I pretend to convince the Reader of it, will &s;ufficiently prove, what Inconveniences he lay under, and what Errors he committed for want of being con|ver&s;ant with them. But here we mu&s;t di|&s;tingui&s;h between the &s;everal kinds of Ac|quaintance: A Man may be &s;aid to be ac|quainted with another who never was but twice in his Company; but that is at the be&s;t a &s;uperficial Acquaintance, from which neither very great Plea&s;ure nor Pro|fit can be deriv'd. Our bu&s;ine&s;s is here to
<PB N="14" REF="25">
&s;hew, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had no familiar Ac|quaintance with the <HI>Graecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Au|thors. For if he was familiarly conver&s;ant with them, how comes it to pa&s;s that he wants Art? Is it that he &s;tudied to know them in other things; and neglected that only in them, which chiefly tends to the Advancement of the Art of the Stage? Or is it that he wanted Di&s;cernment, to &s;ee the Ju&s;tne&s;s and the Greatne&s;s, and the Harmo|ny of their De&s;igns, and the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of tho&s;e Rules upon which tho&s;e De&s;igns are founded? Or how come his Succe&s;&s;ors to have that Di&s;cernment which he wanted, when they fall &s;o much below him in other things? How comes he to have been guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t faults in Chronology, and how come we to find out tho&s;e faults? In his Tragedy of <HI>Troylus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> he in|troduces <HI>Hector</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who was born a thou&s;and Years after the Death of <HI>Hector.</HI> In the &s;ame Play mention is made of <HI>Milo,</HI> which is another very great fault in Chronology. <HI>Alexander</HI> is mention'd in <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> tho' that Conqueror of the Ori|ent liv'd above Two hundred Years after him. In this la&s;t Tragedy he has mi&s;taken the ve|ry Names of his Dramatick Per&s;ons, if we give Credit to <HI>Livy.</HI> For the Mother of <HI>Coriolanus</HI> in the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torian is <HI>Vettu|ria,</HI> and the Wife is <HI>Volumnia.</HI> Whereas in
<PB N="15" REF="26">
<HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> the Wife is <HI>Virgilia,</HI> and the Mo|ther <HI>Volumnia.</HI> And the <HI>Vol&s;cian</HI> General in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> is <HI>Tullus Aufidius,</HI> and <HI>Tullus At|tius</HI> in <HI>Livy.</HI> How comes it that he takes <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Word, who was by Birth a <HI>Grae|cian</HI> for the Affairs of <HI>Rome,</HI> rather than that of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torian, if &s;o be that he had read the Latter? Or what Rea&s;on can be given for his not reading him, when he wrote upon a <HI>Roman</HI> Story, but that in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Time there was a Tran&s;lation of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> and there was none of <HI>Livy?</HI> If <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was familiarly conver&s;ant with the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, how came he to intro|duce a Rabble into <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> in which he offended not only again&s;t the Dignity of Tra|gedy, but the Truth of Fact, the Authority of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Writers, the Cu&s;toms of Ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> People? By introducing a Rabble into <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> he only offended again&s;t the Dignity of Tragedy. For that part of the People who ran about the Streets upon great Fe&s;tivals, or publick Calamities, or publick Rejoicings, or Revolutions in Government, are certainly the Scum of the Populace. But the Per&s;ons who in the Time of <HI>Corio|lanus,</HI> ro&s;e in Vindication of their ju&s;t Rights, and extorted from the Patricians the In&s;titu|tion of the Tribunes of the People, and the Per&s;ons by whom afterwards <HI>Coriolanus</HI> was
<PB N="16" REF="27">
tried, were the whole Body of the <HI>Roman</HI> People to the Re&s;erve of the Patricians, which Body included the <HI>Roman</HI> Knights, and the wealthy &s;ub&s;tantial Citizens, who were as different from the Rabble as the Pa|tricians them&s;elves, as qualify'd as the latter to form a right Judgment of Things, and to contemn the vain Opinions of the Rabble. So at lea&s;t <HI>Horace</HI> e&s;teems them, who very well knew his Countrymen.</P>
<Q><L>Offenduntur enim, quibus e&s;t equus, aut pater, aut res,</L>
<L>Nec &s;iquid fricti ciceris probat aut nucis emptor,</L>
<L>Aequis accipiant animis donantve Corona?</L></Q>
<P>Where we &s;ee the Knights and the &s;ub&s;tan|tial Citizens, are rank'd in an equal Degree of Capacity with the <HI>Roman</HI> Senators, and are equally di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Rabble.</P>
<P>If <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was &s;o conver&s;ant with the Ancients, how comes he to have introduc'd &s;ome Characters into his Plays, &s;o unlike what they are to be found in Hi&s;tory? In the Character of <HI>Menenius</HI> in the following Tragedy, he has doubly offended again&s;t that Hi&s;torical Re&s;emblance. For fir&s;t whereas <HI>Menenius</HI> was an eloquent Per&s;on, <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> has made him a downright Buffoon. And how is it po&s;&s;ible for any Man to con|ceive a <HI>Ciceronian Jack-pudding?</HI> Never was
<PB N="17" REF="28">
any Buffoon eloquent, or wi&s;e, or witty, or vertuous. All the good and ill Qualities of a Buffoon are &s;umm'd up in one word, and that is a Buffoon. And &s;econdly, whereas <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has made him a Hater and Con|temner, and Vilifyer of the People, we are a&s;&s;ur'd by the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torian that <HI>Mene|nius</HI> was extremely popular. He was &s;o very far from oppo&s;ing the In&s;titution of the Tribunes, as he is repre&s;ented in <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> that he was chiefly in&s;trumental in it. Af|ter the People had de&s;erted the City, and &s;at down upon the &s;acred Mountain, he was the chief of the Delegates whom the Senate deputed to them, as being look'd upon to be the Per&s;on who would be mo&s;t agrea|ble to them. In &s;hort this very <HI>Menenius</HI> both liv'd and dy'd &s;o very much their Favourite, that dying poor he had pom|pous Funerals at the Expence of the <HI>Roman</HI> People.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> read either <HI>Salu&s;t</HI> or <HI>Ci|cero,</HI> how could he have made &s;o very lit|tle of the fir&s;t and greate&s;t of Men, as that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;hould be but a Fourth-rate Actor in his own Tragedy? How could it have been that &s;eeing <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> we &s;hould a&s;k for <HI>Cae&s;ar?</HI> That we &s;hould a&s;k, where is his unequall'd Greatne&s;s of Mind, his unbounded Thir&s;t of Glory, and that victorious Eloquence, with which he triumph'd over the Souls
<PB N="18" REF="29">
of both Friends and Enemies, and with which he rivall'd <HI>Cicero</HI> in Genius as he did <HI>Pompey</HI> in Power? How fair an Occa|&s;ion was there to open the Character of <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI> in the fir&s;t Scene between <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius?</HI> For when <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> tells <HI>Brutus</HI> that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was but a Man like them, and had the &s;ame natural Imperfections which they had, how natural had it been for <HI>Brutus</HI> to reply, that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> indeed had their Imper|fections of Nature, but neither he nor <HI>Ca&s;|&s;ius</HI> had by any means the great Qualities of <HI>Cae&s;ar:</HI> Neither his Military Vertue nor Science, nor his matchle&s;s Renown, nor his unparallell'd Victories, his unwearied Boun|ty to his Friends, nor his Godlike Clemen|cy to his Foes, his Beneficence, his Muni|ficence, his Ea&s;ine&s;s of Acce&s;s to the mea|ne&s;t <HI>Roman,</HI> his indefatigable Labours, his incredible Celerity, the Plau&s;iblene&s;s if not Ju&s;tne&s;s of his Ambition, that knowing him|&s;elf to be the greate&s;t of Men, he only &s;ought occa&s;ion to make the World confe&s;s him &s;uch. In &s;hort, if <HI>Brutus,</HI> after enu|merating all the wonderful Qualities of <HI>Cae|&s;ar,</HI> had re&s;olv'd in &s;pight of them all to &s;acrifice him to publick Liberty, how had &s;uch a Proceeding heighten'd the Vertue and the Character of <HI>Brutus?</HI> But then in|deed it would have been requi&s;ite that <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI> upon his appearance &s;hould have made
<PB N="19" REF="30" MS="y">
all this good. And as we know no Princi|ple of human Action but human Sentiment only, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> who did greater Things, and had greater De&s;igns than the re&s;t of the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> ought certainly to have out&s;hin'd by many Degrees all the other Characters of his Tragedy. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> ought particularly to have ju&s;tified his Actions, and to have heigh|ten'd his Character, by &s;hewing that what he had done, he had done by Nece&s;&s;ity; that the <HI>Romans</HI> had lo&s;t their <HI>Agrarian,</HI> lo&s;t their Rotation of Magi&s;tracy, and that con&s;equently nothing but an empty Shadow of publick Liberty remain'd. That the <HI>Gracchi</HI> had made the la&s;t noble but un&s;uc|ce&s;sful Efforts, for the re&s;toring the Com|monwealth, that they had fail'd for want of arbitrary irre&s;i&s;tible Power, the Re&s;toration of the <HI>Agrarian</HI> requiring too va&s;t a Retro&s;pect to be done without it; that the Govern|ment, when <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> came to publick Affairs, was got into the Hands of a few, and that tho&s;e few were factious, and were conten|ding among them&s;elves, and if you will pardon &s;o mean an Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;crambling as it were for Power: That <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was re|duc'd to the Nece&s;&s;ity of ruling or him&s;elf obeying a Ma&s;ter; and that apprehending that another would exerci&s;e the &s;upreme Command, without that Clemency and Mo|deration which he did, he had rather cho|&s;en
<PB N="20" REF="31">
to rule than to obey. So that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was faulty not &s;o much in &s;eizing upon the Sovereignty, which was become in a man|ner nece&s;&s;ary, as in not re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the Commonwealth, by re&s;toring the <HI>Agrarian</HI> and the Rotation of Magi&s;tracies, after he had got ab&s;olute and uncontroulable Power. And if <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had &s;eiz'd upon the Sove|reignty only with a View of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing Liberty, he had &s;urpa&s;s'd all Mortals in Godlike Goodne&s;s as much as he did in the re&s;t of his a&s;toni&s;hing Qualities. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I do not remember that we have any Authority from the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians which may induce us to believe, that <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI> had any &s;uch De&s;ign. Nor if he had had any &s;uch View, could he, who was the mo&s;t &s;ecret, the mo&s;t prudent, and the mo&s;t di&s;cerning of Men, have di&s;cover'd it, before his <HI>Parthian</HI> Expedition was over, for fear of utterly di&s;obliging his Veterans. And <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> believ'd that Expedition nece&s;&s;a|ry for the Honour and Intere&s;t of the State, and for his own Glory.</P>
<P>But of this we may be &s;ure that two of the mo&s;t di&s;cerning of all the <HI>Romans,</HI> and who had the deepe&s;t In&s;ight into the Soul of <HI>Cae&s;ar, Salu&s;t</HI> and <HI>Cicero,</HI> were not with|out Hopes that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> would really re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h Liberty, or el&s;e they would not have attack'd him upon it; the one in his Ora|tion
<PB N="21" REF="32">
for <HI>Marcus Marcellus,</HI> the other in the Second Part of that little Treati&s;e <HI>De Re|public&acirc; ordinand&acirc;,</HI> which is addre&s;s'd to <HI>Cae|&s;ar. Haec igitur tibi reliqua pars,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Ci|cero, Hic re&s;tat Actus, in hoc elaborandum e&s;t, ut Rempublicam con&s;tituas, e&acirc;&abque; tu in primis compo&s;it&acirc;, &s;umma Tranquillitate &amp; o|tio perfruare. Cicero</HI> therefore was not without Hope that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> would re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Commonwealth; and any one who at|tentively peru&s;es that Oration of <HI>Cicero,</HI> will find that that Hope was rea&s;onably grounded, upon his knowledge of the great Qualities of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> his Clemency, his Be|neficence, his admirable Di&s;cernment; and that avoidle&s;s Ruine in which the whole Empire would be &s;oon involv'd, if <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> did not effect this. <HI>Salu&s;t</HI> urges it &s;till more home to him and with greater vehe|mence; he has recour&s;e to every Motive that may be thought to be powerful over &s;o great a Soul. He exhorts him by the Memory of his matchle&s;s Conque&s;ts, not to &s;uffer the invincible Empire of the <HI>Roman</HI> People to be devour'd by Time, or to be torn in pieces by Di&s;cord; one of which would &s;oon and infallibly happen, if Liber|ty was not re&s;tor'd.</P>
<P>He introduces his Country and his Pro|genitors urging him in a noble Pro&s;opopeia, by all the mighty Benefits which they had
<PB N="22" REF="33">
conferr'd upon him, with &s;o little Pains of his own, not to deny them that ju&s;t and ea|&s;y Reque&s;t of the Re&s;toration of Liberty. He adjures him by tho&s;e Furies which will eternally haunt his Soul upon his impious Refu&s;al: He implores him by the fore&s;ight of tho&s;e di&s;mal Calamities, that horrible Slaughter, tho&s;e endle&s;s Wars, and that un|bounded Deva&s;tation, which will certainly fall upon Mankind, if the Re&s;toration of Liberty is prevented by his Death, or his incurable Sickne&s;s: And la&s;tly, he entreats him by his Thir&s;t of immortal Glory, that Glory in which he now has Rivals, if he has not Equals; but which, if he re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hes Liberty, will be acknowledg'd by con&s;enting Nations to have neither Equal nor Second.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe that if <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had been acquainted with all this, we had had from him quite another Character of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> than that which we now find in him. He might then have given us a Scene &s;omething like that which <HI>Corneille</HI> has &s;o happily us'd in his <HI>Cinna</HI>; &s;omething like that which really happen'd between <HI>Augu&s;tus, Mecaenas</HI> and <HI>Agrippa.</HI> He might then have intro|duc'd <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> con&s;ulting <HI>Cicero</HI> on the one &s;ide, and on the other <HI>Anthony,</HI> whether he &s;hould retain that ab&s;olute Sovereignty, which he had acquir'd by his Victory, or
<PB N="23" REF="34">
whether he &s;hould re-e&s;tabli&s;h and immorta|lize Liberty. That would have been a Scene, which might have employ'd the fi|ne&s;t Art and the utmo&s;t force of a Writer. That had been a Scene in which all the great Qualities of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> might have been di&s;play'd. I will not pretend to determine here how that Scene might have been turn'd, and what I have already &s;aid on this Sub|ject, has been &s;poke with the utmo&s;t Cau|tion and Diffidence. But this I will ven|ture to &s;ay, that if that Scene had been ma|nag'd &s;o, as, by the powerful Motives em|ploy'd in it, to have &s;haken the Soul of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and to have left room for the lea&s;t Hope, for the lea&s;t Doubt, that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> would have re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd Liberty, after his <HI>Par|thian</HI> Expedition; and if this Conver&s;ation had been kept &s;ecret till the Death of <HI>Cae|&s;ar,</HI> and then had been di&s;cover'd by <HI>An|thony,</HI> then had <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> fall'n, &s;o belov'd and lamented by the <HI>Roman</HI> People, &s;o pitied and &s;o bewail'd even by the Con&s;pirators them&s;elves, as never Man fell. Then there would have been a Cata&s;trophe the mo&s;t dreadful and the mo&s;t deplorable that ever was beheld upon the Tragick Stage. Then had we &s;een the noble&s;t of the Con&s;pirators cur&s;ing their temerarious Act, and the mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive of them, in dreadful expectation of tho&s;e horrible Calamities, which fell up|on
<PB N="24" REF="35">
the <HI>Romans</HI> after the Death of <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> But, Sir, when I write this to you, I write it with the utmo&s;t Deference to the extraordi|nary Judgment of that great Man, who &s;ome Years ago, I hear, alter'd the <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> And I make no doubt but that his fine Di&s;|cernment, and the re&s;t of his great Quali|ties have amply &s;upply'd the Defects which are found in the Character of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>

<P>I Come now to the main Argument, which &s;ome People urge to prove that <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> was conver&s;ant with the Ancients. For there is, &s;ay they, among <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Plays, one call'd <HI>The Comedy of Errors,</HI> which is undeniably an Imitation of the <HI>Menechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus.</HI> Now <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> &s;ay they, be|ing conver&s;ant with <HI>Plautus,</HI> it undeniably follows that he was acquainted with the Ancients; becau&s;e no <HI>Roman</HI> Author could be hard to him who had conquer'd <HI>Plautus.</HI> To which I an&s;wer, that the Errors which we have mention'd above are to be accoun|ted for no other way, but by the want of knowing the Ancients, or by downright want of Capacity. But nothing can be more ab|&s;urd or more unju&s;t than to impute it to want of Capacity. For the very Sentiments of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> alone are &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that he had a great Under&s;tanding: And therefore we mu&s;t account &s;ome other way
<PB N="26" REF="37">
for his Imitation of the <HI>Menechmi.</HI> I re|member to have &s;een among the Tran&s;la|tions of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Epi&s;tles printed by Mr. <HI>Ton|&s;on,</HI> an Imitation of that from <HI>Oenone</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> tells us in his Pre|face to tho&s;e Epi&s;tles was imitated by one of the Fair Sex who under&s;tood no Latin, but that &s;he had done enough to make tho&s;e blu&s;h who under&s;tood it the be&s;t. There are at this day &s;everal Tran&s;lators, who as <HI>Hudibra&s;s</HI> has it,</P>
<Q><L>Tran&s;late from Languages of which</L>
<L>They under&s;tand no part of Speech.</L></Q>
<P>I will not affirm that of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>; I be|lieve he was able to do what Pedants call con&s;true, but that he was able to read <HI>Plau|tus</HI> without Pain and Difficulty I can never believe. Now I appeal to you, Sir, what time he had between his Writing and his Acting, to read any thing that could not be read with Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure. We &s;ee that our Adver&s;aries them&s;elves acknowledge, that if <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was able to read <HI>Plautus</HI> with Ea&s;e, nothing in Latinity could be hard to him. How comes it to pa&s;s then, that he has given us no Proofs of his fa|miliar Acquaintance with the Ancients, but this Imitation of the <HI>Menechmi,</HI> and a Ver|&s;ion of two Epi&s;tles of <HI>Ovid?</HI> How comes
<PB N="27" REF="38">
it that he had never read <HI>Horace</HI> of a &s;upe|riour Merit to either, and particularly his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Pi&s;o's,</HI> which &s;o much concern'd his Art? Or if he had read that Epi&s;tle, how comes it that in his <HI>Troylus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;i|da</HI> [we mu&s;t ob&s;erve by the way, that when <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> wrote that Play, <HI>Ben John|&s;on</HI> had not as yet tran&s;lated that Epi&s;tle] he runs counter to the In&s;tructions which <HI>Horace</HI> has given for the forming the Cha|racter of <HI>Achilles?</HI></P>
<Q><L>Scriptor: Honoratum &s;i forte reponis Achillem,</L>
<L>Impiger, Iracundus, Inexorablis, Acer,</L>
<L>Jura neget &s;ibi nata.</L></Q>
<P>Where is the <HI>Impiger,</HI> the <HI>Iracundus,</HI> or the <HI>Acer,</HI> in the Character of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Achilles?</HI> Who is nothing but a drolling, lazy, conceited, overlooking Coxcomb; &s;o far from being the honour'd <HI>Achilles,</HI> the E|pithet that <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> after him give him, that he is de&s;ervedly the Scorn and the Je&s;t of the re&s;t of the Characters, even to that Buffoon <HI>Ther&s;ites.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;ucceeded very well in Comedy, yet his principal Talent and his chief Delight was Tragedy. If then <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> was qualify'd to read <HI>Plautus</HI> with Ea&s;e, he could read with a great deal more Ea&s;e the Tran&s;lations of <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Eu|ripides.</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="39">
And tho' by the&s;e Tran&s;lations he would not have been able to have &s;een the charming colouring of tho&s;e great Ma&s;ters, yet would he have &s;een all the Harmony and the Beauty of their great and their ju&s;t De&s;igns. He would have &s;een enough to have &s;tirr'd up a noble Emulation in &s;o ex|alted a Soul as his. How comes it then that we hear nothing from him, of the <HI>Oe|dipus,</HI> the <HI>Electra,</HI> the <HI>Antigone</HI> of <HI>Sophocles,</HI> of the <HI>Iphigenia</HI>'s, the <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> the <HI>Medea,</HI> the <HI>Hecuba</HI> of <HI>Euripides?</HI> How comes it that we &s;ee nothing in the Conduct of his Pieces, that &s;hews us that he had the lea&s;t Acquaintance with any of the&s;e great Ma|&s;ter-pieces? Did <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> appear to be &s;o nearly touch'd with the Affliction of <HI>He|cuba</HI> for the Death of <HI>Priam,</HI> which was but daub'd and bungled by one of his Coun|trymen, that he could not forbear introdu|cing it as it were by Violence into his own <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and would he make no Imitation, no Commendation, not the lea&s;t mention of the unparallell'd and inimitable Grief of the <HI>Hecuba</HI> of <HI>Euripides?</HI> How comes it, that we find no Imitation of any ancient Play in this but the <HI>Menechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus?</HI> How came he to chu&s;e a Comick preferably to the Tragick Poets? Or how comes he to chu&s;e <HI>Plautus</HI> preferably to <HI>Terence,</HI> who is &s;o much more ju&s;t, more graceful, more
<PB N="29" REF="40">
regular, and more natural? Or how comes he to chu&s;e the <HI>Menechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus,</HI> which is by no means his Ma&s;ter-piece before all his other Comedies? I vehemently &s;u&s;pect that this Imitation of the <HI>Menechmi,</HI> was either from a printed Tran&s;lation of that Comedy which is lo&s;t, or &s;ome Ver&s;ion in Manu&s;cript brought him by a Friend, or &s;ent him perhaps by a Stranger, or from the original Play it &s;elf recommended to him, and read to him by &s;ome learned Friend. In &s;hort, I had rather account for this, by what is not ab&s;urd than by what is, or by a le&s;s Ab&s;urdity than by a grea|ter. For nothing can be more wrong than to conclude from this that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was conver&s;ant with the Ancients; which con|tradicts the Te&s;timony of his Contemporary, and his familiar Acquaintance <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> and of his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Milton</HI>;</P>
<Q><L>Lo <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> Fancy's &s;weete&s;t Child,</L>
<L>Warbles his native Wood-notes wild.</L></Q>
<P>And of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> after them both; and which de&s;troys the mo&s;t glorious Part of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Merit immediately. For how can he be e&s;teem'd equal by Nature, or &s;u|perior to the Ancients, when he falls &s;o far &s;hort of them in Art, tho' he had the Ad|vantage of knowing all that they did before
<PB N="30" REF="41">
him? Nay it deba&s;es him below tho&s;e of common Capacity, by rea&s;on of the Errors which we mention'd above. Therefore he who allows that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had Learning and a familiar Acquaintance with the An|cients, ought to be look'd upon as a De|tractor from his extraordinary Merit, and from the Glory of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> For whe|ther is it more honourable for this I&s;land to have produc'd a Man, who without ha|ving any Acquaintance with the Ancients, or any but a &s;lender and a &s;uperficial one, appears to be their Equal or their Superior by the Force of Genius and Nature, or to have bred one who know|ing the Ancients, falls infinitely &s;hort of them in Art, and con&s;equently in Nature it &s;elf? <HI>Great Britain</HI> has but little Rea&s;on to boa&s;t of its Natives Education, &s;ince the &s;ame that they had here, they might have had in another place. But it may ju&s;tly claim a very great &s;hare in their Nature and Genius; &s;ince the&s;e depend in a great mea|&s;ure on the Climate; and therefore <HI>Horace</HI> in the In&s;truction which he gives for the forming the Characters, advi&s;es the noble <HI>Romans</HI> for who&s;e In&s;truction he chiefly writes to con&s;ider whether the Dramatick Per&s;on whom they introduce is</P>
<Q><PB N="31" REF="42">Colchus an A&s;&s;yrius, Thebis nutritus an Argis.</Q>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have endeavour'd to &s;hew un|der what great Di&s;advantages <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> lay, for want of the Poetical Art, and for want of being conver&s;ant with the Ancients.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, he lay under other very great Inconveniencies. For he was neither Ma&s;ter of Time enough to con&s;ider, cor|rect, and poli&s;h what he wrote, to alter it, to add to it, and to retrench from it, nor had he Friends to con&s;ult upon who&s;e Ca|pacity and Integrity he could depend. And tho' a Per&s;on of very good Judgment, may &s;ucceed very well without con&s;ulting his Friends, if he takes time enough to correct what he writes; yet even the greate&s;t Man that Nature and Art can con&s;pire to accom|pli&s;h, can never attain to Perfection, with|out either employing a great deal of time, or taking the Advice of judicious Friends. Nay, 'tis the Opinion of <HI>Horace,</HI> that he ought to do both.</P>
<Q><L>Siquid tamen olim</L>
<L>Scrip&s;eris, in Metii de&s;cendat Judicis aures,</L>
<L>Et Patris, &amp; no&s;tras; nonum&abque; prematur in Annum.</L></Q>
<P>Now we know very well that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was an Actor, at a Time, when there were
<PB N="32" REF="43">
&s;even or eight Companies of Players in the Town together, who each of them did their utmo&s;t Endeavours to get the Audi|ences from the re&s;t, and con&s;equently that our Author was perpetually call'd upon, by tho&s;e who had the Direction and Manage|ment of the Company to which he belong'd, for new Pieces which might be able to &s;up|port them, and give them &s;ome Advantage over the re&s;t. And 'tis ea&s;y to judge what time he was Ma&s;ter of, between his labo|rious Employment of Acting, and his con|tinual Hurry of Writing. As for Friends, they whom in all likelihood <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> con|&s;ulted mo&s;t, were two or three of his Fel|low-Actors, becau&s;e they had the Care of publi&s;hing his Works committed to them. Now they, as we are told by <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> in his Di&s;coveries were extremely pleas'd with their Friend for &s;carce ever making a Blot; and were very angry with <HI>Ben,</HI> for &s;aying he wi&s;h'd that he had made a thou|&s;and. The Misfortune of it is, that <HI>Horace</HI> was perfectly of <HI>Ben</HI>'s mind.</P>

<L>Could it be known what they di&s;creetly blot.</L></Q>
<P>The&s;e Friends then of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> were not qualify'd to advi&s;e him. As for <HI>Ben John|&s;on,</HI> be&s;ides that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> began to know him late, and that <HI>Ben</HI> was not the mo&s;t communicative Per&s;on in the World of the Secrets of his Art; he &s;eems to me to have had no right Notion of Tragedy. Nay, &s;o far from it, that he who was indeed a very great Man, and who has writ Comedies, by which he has born away the Prize of Co|medy both from Ancients and Moderns, and been an Honour to <HI>Great Britain</HI>; and who has done this without any Rules to guide him, except what his own incomparable Talent dictated to him; This extraordina|ry Man has err'd &s;o gro&s;sly in Tragedy, of which there were not only &s;tated Rules, but Rules which he him&s;elf had often read, and had even tran&s;lated, that he has cho|&s;en two Subjects, which according to tho&s;e very Rules, were utterly incapable of ex|citing either Compa&s;&s;ion or Terror for the principal Characters, which yet are the chief Pa&s;&s;ions that a Tragick Poet ought to endeavour to excite. So that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> having neither had Time to correct, nor
<PB N="34" REF="45">
Friends to con&s;ult, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have frequently left &s;uch faults in his Writings, for the Correction of which either a great deal of Time or a judicious and a well na|tur'd Friend is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>There is more than one Example of every kind of the&s;e Faults in the Tragedies of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and even in the <HI>Coriolanus.</HI> There are Lines that are utterly void of that cele&s;tial Fire, of which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> is &s;ometimes Ma&s;ter in &s;o great a Degree. And con&s;equently there are Lines that are &s;tiff and forc'd, and har&s;h and unmu&s;ical, tho' <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had naturally an admirable Ear for the Numbers. But no Man ever was very mu&s;ical who did not write with Fire, and no Man can always write with Fire, unle&s;s he is &s;o far Ma&s;ter of his Time, as to expect tho&s;e Hours when his Spirits are warm and volatile. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> mu&s;t therefore &s;ometimes have Lines which are neither &s;trong nor graceful? For who
<PB N="35" REF="46">
ever had Force or Grace that had not Spi|rit? There are in his <HI>Coriolanus</HI> among a great many natural and admirable Beauties, three or four of tho&s;e Ornaments which <HI>Horace</HI> would term ambitious; and which we in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are apt to call Fu&s;tian or Bomba&s;t. There are Lines in &s;ome Places which are very ob&s;cure, and whole Scenes which ought to be alter'd.</P>
<P>I have, Sir, employ'd &s;ome Time and Pains, and that little Judgment which I have acquir'd in the&s;e Matters by a long and a faithful reading both of Ancients and Mo|derns, in adding, retrenching and altering &s;e|veral Things in the <HI>Coriolanus</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> but with what Succe&s;s I mu&s;t leave to be de|termin'd by you. I know very well that you will be &s;urpriz'd to find, that after all that I have &s;aid in the former part of this Let|ter, again&s;t <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s introducing the Rab|ble into <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> I have not only retain'd in the &s;econd Act of the following Tragedy the Rabble which is in the Original, but deviated more from the <HI>Roman</HI> Cu&s;toms than <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had done before me. I de|&s;ire you to look upon it as a voluntary Fault and a Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t Conviction: 'Tis one of tho&s;e Things which are <HI>ad Populum Pha|lerae,</HI> and by no means in&s;erted to plea&s;e &s;uch Men as you.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="47">
Thus, Sir, have I laid before you a &s;hort but impartial Account of the Beauties and Defects of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> with an Intention to make the&s;e Letters publick if they are ap|prov'd by you; to teach &s;ome People to di|&s;tingui&s;h between his Beauties and his De|fects, that while they imitate the one, they may with Caution avoid the other [there be|ing nothing of more dangerous Contagion to Writers, and e&s;pecially to young ones than the Faults of great Ma&s;ters] and while with <HI>Milton</HI> they applaud the great Qualities which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had by Nature, they may follow his wi&s;e Example, and form them&s;elves as he a&s;&s;ures us, that he him&s;elf did, upon the Rules and Writings of the Ancients.</P>
<P>Sir, if &s;o candid and able a Judge as your+&s;elf &s;hall happen to approve of this E&s;&s;ay in the main, and to excu&s;e and correct my Er|rors, that Indulgence and that Correction will not only encourage me to make the&s;e Letters publick, but will enable me to bear the Reproach of tho&s;e, who would fix a Brand, even upon the ju&s;te&s;t Critici&s;m, as the Effect of Envy and ill Nature; as if there could po&s;&s;ibly be any ill Nature in the doing Ju&s;tice, or in the endeavouring to ad|vance a very noble and a very u&s;eful Art, and con&s;equently to prove beneficent to Mankind. As for tho&s;e who may accu&s;e

me of the want of a due Veneration for the Merit of an Author of &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd a Re|putation as <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> I &s;hall beg leave to tell them, that they chu&s;e the wronge&s;t time that they could po&s;&s;ibly take for &s;uch an Accu&s;a|tion as that.

<HEAD>To the SPECTATOR upon his Paper on the 16th of <HI>April.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU know, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> that E&s;quire <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> attack'd the Sharpers with Succe&s;s; but <HI>Shadwell</HI> is of Opinion that your Bully with his Box and his fal&s;e Dice is an hone&s;ter Fellow than the Rhetorical Author, who makes u&s;e of his Tropes and Figures which are his High and his Low|runners, to cheat us at once of our Money and of our Intellectuals.</P>
<P>I would not have you think, Mr. <HI>Specta|tor,</HI> that this Reflection is directed to you: 'Tis only intended again&s;t one or two of your Corre&s;pondents, and particularly the <HI>Inns-of|Court</HI>-man, who, as you told us in your Se|cond Paper &s;upplies you with mo&s;t of your Critici&s;m: who &s;eems to me &s;o little to un|der&s;tand the Province that he has underta|ken, that you would do well to advi&s;e him to do by you as he has done by his Father, and make a Bargain in the gro&s;s with &s;ome hone&s;t Fellow to an&s;wer all your Occa&s;ions. Which whole&s;ome Advice if he proves too ob&s;tinate or too proud to take; I am confi|dent
<PB N="39" REF="50">
at lea&s;t that he is too gallant a Per&s;on to take it ill if once a Week or once a Fort|night I &s;hould &s;hew &s;o much Pre&s;umption as to cau&s;e a Writ of Error to be i&s;&s;ued out to rever&s;e his <HI>Temple</HI>-Judgment.</P>
<P>I cannot wonder that Critici&s;m &s;hould de|generate &s;o vilely at a time when Poetry and Acting are &s;unk &s;o low. For as <HI>Hobbes</HI> has ob&s;erv'd, that as often as Rea&s;on is again&s;t a Man, a Man will be again&s;t Rea&s;on; &s;o as often as the Rules are again&s;t an Author, an Author will be again&s;t the Rules. Men fir&s;t write fooli&s;h ridiculous Tragedies, which &s;hock all the Rules of Rea&s;on and Philo&s;o|phy, and then they make fooli&s;h extravagant Rules to fit tho&s;e fooli&s;h Plays. 'Tis impo&s;|&s;ible that your Gentleman of the Inns-of|Court could have &s;ent you &s;o much wrong Sen&s;e as there is in your Paper of the 16^t^h, if he had not formerly writ an ab&s;urd Tra|gedy. There are as many Bulls and Blun|ders, and Contradictions in it almo&s;t as there are Lines, and all deliver'd with that in&s;o|lent and that blu&s;t'ring Air, which u&s;ually attends upon Error, and Delu&s;ion, while Truth, like the Deity that in&s;pires it, comes calmly and without noi&s;e.</P>
<P>To &s;et a few of his Errors in their pro|per Light, he tells us in the beginning of that Paper, <HI>That the Engli&s;h Writers of</HI><PB N="40" REF="51">
<HI>Tragedy are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Notion, that when they repre&s;ent a vertuous or innocent Per&s;on in Di&s;tre&s;s, they ought not to leave him 'till they have deliver'd him out of his Trouble, and made him triumph over his Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>But, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> is this peculiar to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writers of Tragedy? <HI>Have not the</HI> French <HI>Wri|ters of Tragedy the &s;ame Notion? Does not</HI> Ra|cine <HI>tell us, in the Preface to his</HI> Iphigenia,<HI> that it would have been horrible to have defil'd the Stage with the Murther of a Prince&s;s &s;o vir|tuous and &s;o lovely as was</HI> Iphigenia.</P>
<P>But your Corre&s;pondent goes on, <HI>This Error,</HI> &s;ays he, with an in&s;olent and dog|matick Air, <HI>they have been led into by a ridiculous Doctrine in modern Critici&s;m, that they are oblig'd to an equal Di&s;tribution of Re|wards and Puni&s;hments, and an impartial Exe|cution of poetical Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>But who were the fir&s;t who e&s;tabli&s;h'd this Rule he is not able to tell. I take it for granted, that a Man who is ingenuous e|nough to own his Ignorance, is willing to be in&s;tructed. Let me tell him then, that the fir&s;t who e&s;tabli&s;h'd this ridiculous Do|ctrine of modern Critici&s;m, was a certain modern Critick, who liv'd above two thou&s;and Years ago; and who tells us ex|pre&s;ly in the thirteenth Chapter of his criti|cal <HI>Spectator,</HI> which Pedants call his Poetick,
<PB N="41" REF="52">
<HI>That &s;ince a Tragedy, to have all the Beauty of which it is capable, ought to be Implex and not Simple,</HI> (by the way, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> you mu&s;t bear with this critical Cant, as we do with your Speculations and Lucubrations) <HI>and ought to move Compa&s;&s;ion and Terror, for we have already &s;hewn that the exciting the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions is the proper Effect of a tragical Imi|tation, it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that we mu&s;t not choo&s;e a very good Man, to plunge him from a pro&s;perous Condition into Adver&s;ity, for in&s;tead of moving Compa&s;&s;ion and Terrour, that on the contrary would create Horrour, and be dete&s;ted by all the World.</HI></P>
<P>And does not the &s;ame deluded Philo&s;o|pher tell us in the very &s;ame Chapter, that the Fable to which he gives the &s;econd Pre|ference, is that which has a double Con&s;titu|tion, and which ends by a double Cata&s;trophe; a Cata&s;trophe favourable to the Good, and fatal to the Wicked. Is not here, Mr. <HI>Spe|ctator,</HI> a very formal Recommendation of the impartial and exact Execution of poetical Ju|&s;tice? Thus <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> was the fir&s;t who e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd this ridiculous Doctrine of modern Critici&s;m, but Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> was the fir&s;t who introduc'd it into our native Language; who notwith&s;tanding the Rage of all the Poeta|&s;ters of the Times, whom he has exa&s;perated by opening the Eyes of the Blind that they

may &s;ee their Errors, will always pa&s;s with impartial Po&s;terity for a mo&s;t learned, a mo&s;t judicious, and a mo&s;t u&s;eful Critick. Now is not your Corre&s;pondent a profound and a learned Per&s;on? and ought he not to own him&s;elf oblig'd to me for this notable piece of Erudition?</P>
<P>But he goes on in his dictatorian way, <HI>This Rule,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>whoever e&s;tabli&s;h'd it, has, I am &s;ure, no Foundation in Nature, in Rea|&s;on, and in the Practice of the Ancients.</HI> But what will this dogmatick Per&s;on &s;ay now, when we &s;hew him that this contemptible Doctrine of poetical Ju&s;tice is not only foun|ded in Rea&s;on and Nature, but is it &s;elf the Foundation of all the Rules, and ev'n of Tra|gedy it&s;elf? For what Tragedy can there be without a Fable? or what Fable without a Moral? or what Moral without poetical Ju|&s;tice? What Moral, where the Good and the Bad are confounded by De&s;tiny, and peri&s;h alike promi&s;cuou&s;ly. Thus we &s;ee this Do|ctrine of poetical Ju&s;tice is more founded in Rea&s;on and Nature than all the re&s;t of the poetical Rules together. For what can be more natural, and more highly rea&s;onable, than to employ that Rule in Tragedy, with|out which that Poem cannot exi&s;t? Well! but the Practice of the Ancients is again&s;t this poetical Ju&s;tice! What always, Mr. <HI>Spectator!</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="54">
will your Corre&s;pondent have the A&s;&s;urance to affirm that? No, but &s;ometimes: Why then &s;ometimes the Ancients offended again&s;t Rea&s;on and Nature. And who ever believ'd that the Ancients were without Fault, or brought Tragedy to its Perfection. But I &s;hall take another Opportunity to &s;hew that the Practice of the Ancients, in all their Ma|&s;ter-pieces, is exactly according to this fun|damental Rule. I have not time to do that in this &s;hort Letter, becau&s;e that would ne|ce&s;&s;arily oblige me to &s;hew that poetical Ju|&s;tice is of a much larger Extent than this profound Critick imagines; but yet I &s;hall give the di&s;cerning Reader a hint of it in that which follows.</P>
<P><HI>Poetical Ju&s;tice,</HI> &s;ays your Corre&s;pon|dent, <HI>has no Foundation in Nature and Rea&s;on, becau&s;e we find that good and evil happen alike to all Men on this &s;ide the Grave.</HI> In an&s;wer to which he mu&s;t give me leave to tell him, that this is not only a very fal&s;e but a very dan|gerous A&s;&s;ertion; that we neither know what Men really are, nor what they really &s;uffer.</P>
<P>'Tis not always that we know Men's Crimes, but how &s;eldom do we know their Pa&s;&s;ions, and e&s;pecially their darling Pa&s;&s;ions? And as Pa&s;|&s;ion is the Occa&s;ion of infinitely more Di&s;|order in the World than Malice, [for where one Man falls a Sacrifice to inveterate Malice
<PB N="44" REF="55">
a thou&s;and become Victims to Revenge and Ambition; and whereas Malice has &s;ome|thing that &s;hocks human Nature, Pa&s;&s;ion is plea&s;ingly catching and contagious.] Can any thing be more ju&s;t, than that that Providence which governs the World &s;hould puni&s;h Men for indulging their Pa&s;&s;ions, as much as for obeying the Dictates of their mo&s;t envenom'd Hatred and Malice?</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, for ought we know, Good and Evil does not happen alike to all Men on this &s;ide the Grave. Becau&s;e 'tis for the mo&s;t part, by their Pa&s;&s;ions, that Men offend; and 'tis by their Pa&s;&s;ions, for the mo&s;t part, that they are puni&s;h'd. But this is certain, that the more Virtue a Man has the more he commands his Pa&s;&s;ions; but the Virtuous a|lone command them. The Wicked take the utmo&s;t Care to di&s;&s;emble and conceal them; for which rea&s;on we neither know what our Neighbours are, nor what they really &s;uffer. Man is too finite, too &s;hallow, and too emp|ty a Creature to know another Man through|ly, to know the Creature of an infinite Crea|tor; but dramatical Per&s;ons are Creatures of which a Poet is him&s;elf the Creator. And tho' a Mortal is not able to know the Al|mighty's Creatures, he may be allow'd to know his own; to know the utmo&s;t Extent of their Guilt, and what they ought to &s;uf|fer;
<PB N="45" REF="56">
nay, he mu&s;t be allow'd not only to know this him&s;elf, but to make it manife&s;t and unque&s;tionable to all his Readers and Hearers. The Creatures of a poetical Crea|tor have no Di&s;&s;imulation and no Re&s;erve. We &s;ee their Pa&s;&s;ions in all their height, and in all their Deformity; and when they are unfortunate, we are never to &s;eek for the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould grant that there is not always an equal Di&s;tribution of Afflicti|on and Happine&s;s here below. Man is a Creature who was created immortal, and a Creature con&s;equently that will find a Com|pen&s;ation in Futurity for any &s;eeming Inequa|lity in his Dealing here. But the Creatures of a poetical Creator are imaginary and tran|&s;itory; they have no longer Duration than the Repre&s;entation of their re&s;pective Fables; and con&s;equently, if they offend, they mu&s;t be puni&s;h'd during that Repre&s;entation. And therefore we are very far from pretending that poetical Ju&s;tice is an equal Repre&s;entati|on of the Ju&s;tice of the Almighty.</P>
<P>We freely confe&s;s that 'tis but a very narrow and a very imperfect Type of it; &s;o very narrow, and &s;o very imperfect, that 'tis forc'd by temporal to repre&s;ent eter|nal Puni&s;hments; and therefore when we &s;hew a Man unfortunate in Tragedy, for
<PB N="46" REF="57">
not re&s;training his Pa&s;&s;ions, we mean that e|very one will for &s;uch Neglect, unle&s;s he timely repents, be infallibly puni&s;h'd by infi|nite Ju&s;tice either here or hereafter.</P>
<P>If upon this foot we examine the Trage|dies of <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Euripides,</HI> we &s;hall find that in their mo&s;t beautiful Pieces, they are impartial Executors of Poetick Ju&s;tice. And 'tis upon this foot that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> requires that we &s;hould examine them. Your Corre&s;pon|dent I mu&s;t confe&s;s is in the right when he &s;ays that that Philo&s;opher declares for Tra|gedies, who&s;e Cata&s;trophes are unhappy with relation to the principal Characters. But then what In&s;tructions does he give us for the for|ming tho&s;e principal Characters? We are neither to make them very vertuous Per|&s;ons on the one &s;ide, that is Per&s;ons who ab|&s;olutely command their Pa&s;&s;ions, nor on the other &s;ide Villains who are actuated by in|veterate Malice, but &s;omething between the&s;e two, that is to &s;ay Per&s;ons who neglecting their Pa&s;&s;ions &s;uffer them to grow outrageous, and to hurry them to Actions which they would otherwi&s;e abhor. And that Philo&s;o|pher expre&s;sly declares as we have &s;hewn a|bove, that to make a vertuous Man unhap|py, that is a Man who ab&s;olutely commands his Pa&s;&s;ions, would create Horror in&s;tead of Compa&s;&s;ion, and would be dete&s;ted by all
<PB N="47" REF="58">
the World. And thus we have &s;hewn that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> is for Poetical Ju&s;tice, notwith&s;tan|ding that he is for unhappy Cata&s;trophes: And &s;o one would think was your Corre&s;pon|dent. For when he enumerates and com|mends &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tragedies, which have unfortunate Cata&s;trophes; there are not two of tho&s;e which he commends, who&s;e princi|pal Characters can be &s;aid to be innocent, and con&s;equently there are not two of them where there is not a due Ob&s;ervance of poe|tical Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Thus, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> I have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the Bu&s;ine&s;s of poetical Ju&s;tice, and &s;hewn it to be the Foundation of all Tragedy; and therefore whatever Per&s;ons, whether ancient or modern, have writ Dialogues which they call Tragedies, where this Ju&s;tice is not ob|&s;erv'd, tho&s;e Per&s;ons have entertain'd and a|mus'd the World with romantick lamentable Tales, in&s;tead of ju&s;t Tragedies, and of law|ful Fables.</P>
<P>'Tis not my Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent to take a|ny farther notice of the Errors of your Cor|re&s;pondent; perhaps I no more approve of Tragi-Comedies, or Tragedies with double Plots, than he does; but I hope he will not take it ill if I put him in mind that &s;everal of the Plays which he recommended before are Tragi-Comedies, and that mo&s;t of them
<PB N="48" REF="59">
have double Plots. But he is vilely mi&s;taken if he thinks that Tragi-Comedy is of the Growth of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Theatres.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take another Opportunity to &s;hew him that he is as much mi&s;taken in what he has &s;aid of Humours, as in what he dictates concerning poetical Ju&s;tice.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER to the SPECTATOR upon his Paper on the 24th of <HI>April.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have read over your Paper of the 24^t^h with a great deal of Satisfaction, and here return you my Acknowledgments for the Honour you have done me in quoting two of my Ver&s;es with Applau&s;e. I think my &s;elf oblig'd in Gratitude, my worthy Friend, to do as much Honour to your Judgment as you have done to my Imagination; and as you have the Goodne&s;s to allow me to be an humorous Poet, I am bound in Ju&s;tice to ce|lebrate you for a wonderful Critick; and to make it appear that contrary to the Ob&s;ervation of the Author of a late Rhap&s;ody, one who has &s;hewn him&s;elf no great Poet may be a prodigious Judge. Indeed the Ob&s;ervation of that Author is &s;o far from being true, that mo&s;t of the Criticks Ancient and Mo|dern have been no Poets, and mo&s;t of the Poets Ancient and Modern have been no Criticks. I cannot find out that any but <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> and <HI>Sopho|cles,</HI> and <HI>Euripides</HI> among the Ancients were
<PB N="50" REF="61">
great Criticks. For who can believe that has read them, that <HI>Apollonius Rhodius, Non|nus, Lucan, Statius,</HI> and <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> ever &s;o much as heard that Nature, and the Phi|lo&s;ophers her Interpreters and Commentators had laid down Rules for an Epick Poem? And who that has read the Moderns could imagine, that mo&s;t of their Dramatick Poets, had ever &s;o much as heard that there were &s;uch things as the Rules. As <HI>Boileau</HI> has ob&s;erv'd of the <HI>French,</HI> that &s;ome Per&s;ons among them had di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves by their Rhimes, who never knew how to di|&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Lucan</HI> from <HI>Virgil</HI>; &s;o &s;ome a|mong our own Rhimers have been renown'd for ver&s;ifying, who never &s;o much as knew that <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> were good Poets. And I can on the other &s;ide name &s;everal who never di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by Poe|try, who yet have oblig'd the World with Critici&s;ms which have been Non-pareillo's, and the very Top-Critick of all tho&s;e Cri|ticks is my worthy Friend the <HI>Spectator.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' who the Devil could have ever ex|pected to have found my worthy Friend a Critick, after he had treated Criticks with &s;o much Contempt in two or three of his Immortal <HI>Tatlers,</HI> and particularly in the 29^t^h and the 246^t^h, where they are pronounc'd to be the &s;illie&s;t of Mortals,
<PB N="51" REF="62">
Creatures, for&s;ooth, who profe&s;s Judgment; tho' by the way, Mr <HI>Spectator,</HI> he who pro|fe&s;&s;es or practi&s;es Poetry, and does not pro|fe&s;s Judgment in it, profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf an A&s;s. It was from tho&s;e <HI>Tatlers</HI> and one or two more, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> that I gue&s;s'd that you had a mortal Aver&s;ion to Critici&s;m; but now I find plainly that they were none of your own, but were &s;ent you by two or three damn'd Poets, who are a &s;ort of Of|fenders that have not half the Charity which other Malefactors are wont to &s;hew, but bear eternal Malice to their Executioners.</P>
<P>Thus the Invectives again&s;t Criticks and Critici&s;m were other Peoples; you were too wi&s;e to write any &s;uch thing, as knowing that Ta&s;t which declines &s;o fa&s;t is only to be re&s;tor'd and maintain'd by Critici&s;m. And therefore in&s;tead of writing Invectives again&s;t it, you have oblig'd the World with the thing it &s;elf, with Critici&s;m upon Critici&s;m, and &s;uch Critici&s;m.&mdash;As tho&s;e <HI>Tatlers</HI> were the Off-&s;pring of &s;ome certain Poets, which is manife&s;t by their in&s;ipid Satyr, like the faint Eagerne&s;s of Vinegar decay'd: no|thing is more clear than that the Critici&s;ms could be none but yours. For as you may di&s;cover <HI>ex ungue Leonem, &amp; ex pede Her|cules,</HI> &s;o in this Ca&s;e the prodigious Off|&s;pring &s;peaks and confe&s;&s;es the Gigantick Fa|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="63">
In your very Folio of the 24^t^h of <HI>April,</HI> how have you &s;hewn the Fine&s;s of your Di&s;cernment, and the Profundity of your Penetration, by your Encomium of two Ver|&s;es of my Tran&s;lation of the Fourth Satyr of <HI>Boileau?</HI> Tis now thirty Years &s;ince I tran|&s;lated that Satyr, and con&s;equently was a very Boy at the Time of that Tran&s;lation; yet from that Time to this the &s;tupid Age has been ignorant of the Beauty of that Couplet. How very flegmatick a Wretch have I been, and how illegitimate an Off|&s;pring of Mr. <HI>Bays,</HI> not to know any thing of my own Excellence till I heard of it from you?</P>
<P>How little did I imagine when I tran&s;la|ted that Couplet, that the great Critick was then in Embrio who thirty Years afterwards &s;hould declare it to be a charming Couplet, by giving it a place in his never dying Spe|culations.</P>
<P>I am perfectly convinc'd, my mo&s;t wor|thy and mo&s;t ingenious Friend, that we Au|thors are as blind and as partial Judges of our own Works, as we are unrighteous ones of other Peoples. I was apt to imagine, be|fore I &s;ubmitted my own Opinion to the de|ci&s;ive Authority of your Judgment; that you would have done more for the Credit of my Genius and of your own Di&s;cernment,
<PB N="53" REF="64">
by commending the following Ver&s;es of the Fourth Book of the Poem upon the Battel of <HI>Ramelies,</HI> when you had &s;o fair an occa|&s;ion of taking notice of them, as you had at the writing the 56^t^h <HI>Tatler.</HI> If I begin the Ver&s;es a little higher than the couching of the Cataracts which is the Subject of the 56^t^h <HI>Tatler,</HI> I am confident you will have the Goodne&s;s to pardon me, and the rather becau&s;e you di&s;cover'd more than a common Satisfaction when you were pre&s;ent with your Friend Mr. <HI>A.</HI> at the reading tho&s;e Ver&s;es in Manu&s;cript. A cele&s;tial Spirit vi&s;its the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> in a Vi&s;ion the Night before the Battel of <HI>Ramelies,</HI> and after he has &s;aid &s;everal other things to him goes on thus.</P>

<P>The&s;e are the Ver&s;es, my mo&s;t di&s;cerning Friend, that I thought might have been pre|ferr'd to the foremention'd Couplet, e&s;peci|ally &s;ince they would as it were have intro|duced them&s;elves, whereas the Couplet is dragg'd in by extreme Violence. But I &s;ub|mit to your infallible Judgment, not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting that my worthy Friend can have any Malice in this Affair, and in&s;ert that Couplet in his immortal Speculations only on purpo&s;e to expo&s;e me; no, far be it

from me to entertain any &s;uch Jealou&s;y of my deare&s;t Friend, who is &s;o good, &s;o kind, &s;o beneficent, and who has &s;o often given him&s;elf the glorious Title of the Lover and Benefactor of Mankind. Who could ima|gine that one who hath given him&s;elf that glorious Appellation, could e'er be prom|pted by Malice or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Intere&s;t thus &s;lily and hypocritically to abu&s;e one whom he had call'd his Friend?</P>
<P>I have been apt to believe likewi&s;e, my worthy Friend, that you would have been kinder to your &s;elf and to me, if in&s;tead of commending the foremention'd Couplet you had taken &s;ome notice of the following Ver|&s;es which are in my Paraphra&s;e upon the <HI>Te Deum</HI>; e&s;pecially when you had &s;o fair an occa&s;ion to mention them as you had at the writing the 119^t^h <HI>Tatler.</HI> The Couplet of the tran&s;lated Satyr was introduced by Violence. But how very naturally would the following Ver&s;es of the Paraphra&s;e, have been mention'd either before or after the la&s;t Paragraph of the foremention'd Paper, where a Spirit is introduc'd, who after he has &s;poke of that part of the Creation which is too little for human Sight, comes afterwards to &s;peak of the immen&s;e Objects of Nature af|ter this manner.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tat. 119.</NOTE> I mu&s;t acknowledge for my own part, that altho' it is with much Delight that I &s;ee the Traces of Providence in the&s;e In&s;tances, I &s;till &s;ee greater plea|&s;ure in con&s;idering the Works of the Creation in their Immen&s;ity, than in their Mi|nutene&s;s.

<P><PB N="59" REF="70">
'Tis for this Rea&s;on that I am glad the Ver&s;es were printed &s;ome Years before the Pro&s;e. For you know, my dear Friend, that a Plagiary in general is but a &s;can|dalous Creature, a &s;ort of a &s;piritual Out|law, and ought to be treated as &s;uch by all the Members of the Commonwealth of Lear|ning. But a Plagiary from living Authors is mo&s;t profligately impudent, and in &s;o &s;low and &s;plenatick a Nation as ours mo&s;t unju&s;t and barbarous. For among us any thing that is admirably good is twenty or thirty Years before it comes to be under&s;tood. And how infinitely ba&s;e is it in the mean while to de|prive an Author of any thing that is va|luable in him, and to intercept his coming Prai&s;e. As Laws are made for the Security of Property, what pity 'tis that there are not &s;ome enacted for the Security of a Man's Thoughts and Inventions, which alone are properly his. For Land is alienable and Trea|&s;ure is tran&s;itory, and both mu&s;t at one time or other pa&s;s, either by his own voluntary Act, or by the Violence and Inju&s;tice of others, or at lea&s;t by Fate. And therefore nothing is truly and really a Man's own.</P>

'Tis only a Man's Thoughts and Inventions that are properly his: being alone Things that can never be alienated from him, nei|ther by Force nor Per&s;ua&s;ion, nor by Fate it &s;elf; and tho' another may ba&s;ely u&s;urp the Honour of them, yet they mu&s;t for ever rightfully belong to their fir&s;t Inventor. Thus even the riche&s;t and the happie&s;t of Men have nothing that is truly and really their own but their Thoughts and Inventions. But Au|thors for the mo&s;t part, and e&s;pecially Poets have nothing that can &s;o much as be call'd their own but their Thoughts. 'Tis for tho&s;e alone, and the Glory which they expect from tho&s;e that they entirely quit their Preten&s;ions to Riches, and renounce the Pomps and Va|nities of this wicked World; and therefore to endeavour to deprive them of tho&s;e is ex|ceedingly inhuman. What a Joy 'tis to think that the Precedence of Times &s;ets me free from the Imputation of this Inju&s;tice? Had I been capable of doing this, and doing it to my worthy Friend, of wronging my deare&s;t Friend in this manner, who knows how far that Barbarity might have extended it &s;elf; I might have proceeded to have upbraided him with &s;ome weak place in his never-dying Folio's; and having forcibly depriv'd him of his Silver and his Gold, have pelted him with his Bra&s;s and his Copper out of counterfeit

And here, my dear Friend, at the &s;ame time that I acknowledge your uncommon Merit, I cannot but congratulate your incom|parable Felicity, It being plain that you have got more Reputation in three Years time than <HI>Milton</HI> has done in fifty Years, or than <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> has in an hundred. I &s;hall therefore ju|diciou&s;ly conclude with the generality of your Readers, that you have a Merit paramount to that of all <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Authors both living and dead, and that you have not only more Merit than any one Morali&s;t either Ancient or Mo|dern, but that if you continue your Paper Three Years longer, you will have as much Merit as they have all together.

<SALUTE>Mr. Spectator,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU tell us in your Fourth Paper, that you know Peoples Thoughts by their Eyes. How apt we are all to imagine fine Things of our &s;elves! e&s;pecially we Au|thors, Mr. <HI>Spectator.</HI> There was a certain Friend of mine, a Squire lately defunct, who made the very &s;ame boa&s;t that you do; and yet he recommended a Pettifogger to me for an hone&s;t Fellow, who diving into my Se|crets, betray'd me to tho&s;e very People with whom he pretended to &s;erve me; a Petti|fogger thro' who&s;e Eyes, even I and &s;everal others who pretend to none of my Friend the Squire's Profundity, can di&s;cern the working of his mi&s;chievous Thoughts, as plainly as I can &s;ee the Operations of Bees thro' a Cry&s;tal Hive.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> as I found my &s;elf betray'd, I began to enquire into this Fel|low's Character, tho' if you were to look be|tween his two Eyes, you wou'd &s;wear there was no occa&s;ion for it. For, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> he tells you what he is, when he only looks on you; and uniting in his pettifogging Per|&s;on both your noble Attributes, is at one
<PB N="63" REF="74">
and the &s;ame time <HI>Tatler</HI> and <HI>Spectator.</HI> In &s;hort, tho' he is an errant Traytor in his Heart, his Face is a plain Dealer, and lets you immediately without Ceremony and with|out Re&s;erve into the inmo&s;t Secrets of his Soul.</P>
<P>Upon Enquiry I found his Character to be as extraordinary as his Per&s;on. He is by Po|liticks a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> by Moral Principle a Set|ter and a Betrayer, by Religion a Quaker, an utter Foe to all Civil and Religious Cere|mony, unle&s;s it be drinking the Pretender's Health on his Knees, to whom alone of the Race of Men he has been true and faithful: By this one may gue&s;s that his Education has been very extraordinary. I find upon the mo&s;t curious Enquiry that I have been able to make, that the only Schools that ever he has been at have been &s;punging Hou&s;es and County-Gaols; and that his two Univer&s;ities have been the <HI>Fleet</HI> and the <HI>Queen's-Bench.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> that this Letter may afford you a Hint, for a Lucubration, or a Speculation, or whatever other learned Term you may be pleas'd to give it; which by di&s;covering to your Readers the Error and the Frailty of the Squire lately defunct, may convince them how little we know even tho&s;e with whom we daily conver&s;e. A|las our Judgments of one another are empty

and &s;uperficial, and either built upon vain Appearances, or the Reports of tho&s;e, who neither truly know us, nor &s;peak what they really think of us, but often traduce us, and mi&s;repre&s;ent us, in order to comfort or vindi|cate, or to &s;upport them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But of all Mankind there are none who know the re&s;t of Men &s;o little as the genera|lity of your Authors; for this Pettifogger was &s;o fooli&s;h a Rogue, that any one might &s;ee thro' him at fir&s;t &s;ight. And yet my Friend the Squire was &s;tark blind to him: By the way, you may know that my Friend the Squire was an Author, as celebrated an Author as you are, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> a Penny-Folio Author. He got &s;ome Reputation by his Lucubrations; but had the Fault of mo&s;t Authors who have more Imagination than Judgment, he could not leave off when he was well; not con&s;idering, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> that had hone&s;t Sir <HI>Martin</HI> left off in time, his Mi&s;tre&s;s had never made the Di&s;covery that <HI>Warner</HI> play'd and &s;ung for him.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Spectator,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have a &s;hort Ca&s;e of Con&s;cience to put to you; to You who have e&s;tabli&s;h'd your &s;elf in the Office of <HI>Ductor Dubitantium</HI> ge|neral. About <HI>January</HI> la&s;t I happen'd to have an Obligation to a certain Author, an Obligation that repo&s;ed a Tru&s;t in me which I have &s;ince di&s;charg'd. Being pleas'd with the Frankne&s;s of this Author's doing this, I re&s;olv'd upon reading his celebrated Penny|Folio's, I mean upon reading them in order. For till then, I had read but here and there one, and none at all of the fir&s;t two Months. The fir&s;t thing that I ob&s;erv'd in them was, that I was endeavour'd to be expos'd and ca|lumniated clande&s;tinely and perfidiou&s;ly by one who at the &s;ame time care&s;s'd me where|e'er he &s;aw me, and call'd him&s;elf my Friend, and all this only to &s;erve a poor pitiful Turn, which was to e&s;tabli&s;h the Opera at the Ex|pence of Dramatick Poetry; I &s;ay of Drama|tick Poetry, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> if it had not been for which, that Author had long &s;ince been in the Du&s;t. The <HI>Quere</HI> is, whether the fore&s;aid Obligation ought to debar me of the Right of vindicating the Truth and my &s;elf. It was not long after this, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> that
<PB N="66" REF="77">
the above&s;aid Author repented him &s;o far of the Obligation he had laid on me, that he in|&s;ulted and affronted me &s;everal times mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly by a Wretch &s;o de&s;picable and &s;o impotent, that it would have been Cowar|dice to have beat him; a Wretch who&s;e Cha|racter will come enclos'd to you in the &s;ame Cover with this; and not content with that, en|deavour'd once more to expo&s;e me in his Quo|tidian Folio's. The &s;econd <HI>Quere</HI> is, Mr. <HI>Specta|tor,</HI> whether I am not free, now I am got quit of the Obligation which was laid upon me, tho' it had been far greater than it was, to &s;hew my ju&s;t Re&s;entment, which I am about to do by publi&s;hing three or four mode&s;t Let|ters which I have pick'd and cull'd from the numerous company of tho&s;e which are more bitter, and which I re&s;olve to &s;uppre&s;s in or|der to &s;hew that I have a Soul that is capa|ble of remembring Obligations, as well as of revenging Injuries I impatiently expect your Deci&s;ion in this matter! in the mean time it &s;eems to me that common Sen&s;e obliges me to believe, that no Man can have an Obligation &s;trong enough laid on him to make him pa&s;s by a Box on the Ear, or the being expos'd in Print, without returning each of th' Affronts in kind.
