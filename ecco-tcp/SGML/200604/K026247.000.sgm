<HEAD>A
CONVERSATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN February, 1767, there happened one of the mo&s;t remarkable incidents
of John&s;on's life, which gratified his monarchical enthu&s;ia&s;m, and which he
loved to relate with all its circum&s;tances, when reque&s;ted by his friends. This
was his being honoured by a private conver&s;ation with his Maje&s;ty, in the
library at the Queen's hou&s;e. He had frequently vi&s;ited tho&s;e &s;plendid rooms
and noble collection of books<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on had the honour of contributing his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the formation of this library; for I have read a long letter from him to Mr. Barnard, giving the mo&s;t ma&s;terly in&s;tructions on the &s;ubject. I wi&s;hed much to have gratified my readers with the peru&s;al of this letter, and have rea|&s;on to think that his Maje&s;ty would have been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to permit its publication; but Mr. Barnard, to whom I applied, declined it "on his own account."</NOTE>, which he u&s;ed to &s;ay was more numerous and
curious than he &s;uppo&s;ed any per&s;on could have made in the time which the
King had employed. Mr. Barnard, the librarian, took care that he &s;hould
have every accommodation that could contribute to his ea&s;e and convenience,
while indulging his literary ta&s;te in that place; &s;o that he had here a very
agreeable re&s;ource at lei&s;ure hours.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty having been informed of his occa&s;ional vi&s;its, was plea&s;ed to
&s;ignify a de&s;ire that he &s;hould be told when Dr. John&s;on came next to the
library. Accordingly, the next time that John&s;on did come, as &s;oon as he
was fairly engaged with a book, on which, while he &s;at by the fire, he &s;eemed
quite intent, Mr. Barnard &s;tole round to the apartment where the King was,
and, in obedience to his Maje&s;ty's commands, mentioned that Dr. John&s;on was
then in the library. His Maje&s;ty &s;aid he was at lei&s;ure, and would go to him;
upon which Mr. Barnard took one of the candles that &s;tood on the King's table,
and lighted his Maje&s;ty through a &s;uite of rooms, till they came to a private
<PB N="4" REF="4">
door into the library, of which his Maje&s;ty had the key. Being entered, Mr.
Barnard &s;tepped forward ha&s;tily to Dr. John&s;on, who was &s;till in a profound
&s;tudy, and whi&s;pered him, "Sir, here is the King." John&s;on &s;tarted up, and &s;tood
&s;till. His Maje&s;ty approached him, and at once was courteou&s;ly ea&s;y<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The particulars of this conver&s;ation I have been at great pains to collect with the utmo&s;t authenticity, from Dr. John&s;on's own detail to my&s;elf; from Mr. Langton, who was pre&s;ent when he gave an account of it to Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton, and &s;everal other friends, at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's; from Mr. Barnard; from the copy of a letter written by the late Mr. Strahan the printer, to Bi&s;hop Warburton; and from a minute, the original of which is among the papers of the late Sir James Caldwell, and a copy of which was mo&s;t obligingly obtained for me from his &s;on Sir John Caldwell, by Sir Francis Lumm. To all the&s;e gentlemen I beg leave to make my grateful acknowledgements, and particularly to Sir Francis Lumm, who was plea&s;ed to take a great deal of trouble, and even had the minute laid before the King by Lord Caermarthen, now Duke of Leeds, one of his Maje&s;ty's Principal Secretaries of State, who announced to Sir Francis the Royal plea&s;ure concerning it by a letter, in the&s;e words: "I have the King's commands to a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, how &s;en&s;ible his Maje&s;ty is of your attention in communicating the minute of the conver&s;ation previous to its publication. As there appears no objection to your complying with Mr. Bo&s;well's wi&s;hes on the &s;ubject, you are at full liberty to deliver it to that gentleman, to make &s;uch u&s;e of in his Life of Dr. John&s;on, as he may think proper."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty began by ob&s;erving, that he under&s;tood he came &s;ometimes to
the library; and then mentioning his having heard that the Doctor had been
lately at Oxford, a&s;ked him if he was not fond of going thither. To which
John&s;on an&s;wered, that he was indeed fond of going to Oxford &s;ometimes,
but was likewi&s;e glad to come back again. The King then a&s;ked him what
they were doing at Oxford. John&s;on an&s;wered, he could not much commend
their diligence, but that in &s;ome re&s;pects they were mended, for they had put
their pre&s;s under better regulations, and were at that time printing Polybius.
He was then a&s;ked whether there were better libraries at Oxford or Cambridge.
He an&s;wered, he believed the Bodleian was larger than any they had at Cam|bridge;
at the &s;ame time adding, "I hope, whether we have more books or
not than they have at Cambridge, we &s;hall make as good u&s;e of them as they
do." Being a&s;ked whether All-Souls or Chri&s;t-Church library was the large&s;t,
he an&s;wered, "All-Souls library is the large&s;t we have, except the Bodleian."
"Aye, (&s;aid the King,) that is the publick library."</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty enquired if he was then writing any thing. He an&s;wered,
he was not, for he had pretty well told the world what he knew, and mu&s;t
now read to acquire more knowledge. The King, as it &s;hould &s;eem with a
<PB N="5" REF="5">
view to urge him to rely on his own &s;tores as an original writer, and to continue
his labours, then &s;aid, "I do not think you borrow much from any body."
John&s;on &s;aid, he thought he had already done his part as a writer. "I &s;hould
have thought &s;o too, (&s;aid the King,) if you had not written &s;o well."&mdash;
John&s;on ob&s;erved to me, upon this, that "No man could have paid a hand|&s;omer
compliment; and it was fit for a King to pay. It was deci&s;ive." When
a&s;ked by another friend, at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, whether he made any reply
to this high compliment, he an&s;wered, "No, Sir. When the King had &s;aid
it, it was to be &s;o. It was not for me to bandy civilities with my &s;overeign."
Perhaps no man who had &s;pent his whole life in courts could have &s;hewn a
more nice and dignified &s;en&s;e of true politene&s;s, than John&s;on did in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty having ob&s;erved to him that he &s;uppo&s;ed he mu&s;t have read a
great deal; John&s;on an&s;wered, that he thought more than he read; that he
had read a great deal in the early part of his life, but having fallen into ill
health, he had not been able to read much, compared with others: for
in&s;tance, he &s;aid he had not read much compared with Dr. Warburton. Upon
which the King &s;aid, that he heard Dr. Warburton was a man of &s;uch general
knowledge, that you could &s;carce talk with him on any &s;ubject on which he
was not qualified to &s;peak; and that his learning re&s;embled Garrick's acting,
in its univer&s;ality. His Maje&s;ty then talked of the controver&s;y between
Warburton and Lowth, which he &s;eemed to have read, and a&s;ked John&s;on
what he thought of it. John&s;on an&s;wered, "Warburton has mo&s;t general,
mo&s;t &s;chola&s;tick learning; Lowth is the more correct &s;cholar. I do not know
which of them calls names be&s;t." The King was plea&s;ed to &s;ay he was of
the &s;ame opinion; adding, "You do not think then, Dr. John&s;on, that there
was much argument in the ca&s;e." John&s;on &s;aid, he did not think there was.
"Why truly, (&s;aid the King,) when once it comes to calling names, argu|ment
is pretty well at an end."</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty then a&s;ked him what he thought of Lord Lyttelton's hi&s;tory,
which was then ju&s;t publi&s;hed. John&s;on &s;aid, he thought his &s;tyle pretty good,
but that he had blamed Henry the Second rather too much. "Why, (&s;aid
the King,) they &s;eldom do the&s;e things by halves." "No, Sir, (an&s;wered
John&s;on,) not to Kings." But fearing to be mi&s;under&s;tood, he proceeded to
explain him&s;elf; and immediately &s;ubjoined, "That for tho&s;e who &s;poke
wor&s;e of Kings than they de&s;erved, he could find no excu&s;e, but that he could
more ea&s;ily conceive how &s;ome might &s;peak better of them than they de&s;erved,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
without any ill intention; for, as Kings had much in their power to give,
tho&s;e who were favoured by them would frequently, from gratitude, exagge|rate
their prai&s;es; and as this proceeded from a good motive, it was certainly
excu&s;eable, as far as errour could be excu&s;eable."</P>
<P>The King then a&s;ked him what he thought of Dr. Hill. John&s;on an&s;wered,
that he was an ingenious man, but had no veracity; and immediately
mentioned, as an in&s;tance of it, an a&s;&s;ertion of that writer, that he had
&s;een objects magnified to a much greater degree by u&s;ing three or four micro|&s;copes
at a time, than by u&s;ing one. "Now, (added John&s;on,) every one
acquainted with micro&s;copes knows, that the more of them he looks through,
the le&s;s the object will appear." "Why, (replied the King,) this is not only
telling an untruth, but telling it clum&s;ily; for, if that be the ca&s;e, every one
who can look through a micro&s;cope will be able to detect him."</P>
<P>"I now, (&s;aid John&s;on to his friends, when relating what had pa&s;&s;ed,)
began to con&s;ider that I was depreciating this man in the e&s;timation of his
&s;overeign, and thought it was time for me to &s;ay &s;omething that might be
more favourable." He added, therefore, that Dr. Hill was, notwith&s;tanding,
a very curious ob&s;erver; and if he would have been contented to tell the
world no more than he knew, he might have been a very con&s;iderable man,
and needed not to have recour&s;e to &s;uch mean expedients to rai&s;e his
reputation.</P>
<P>The King then talked of literary journals, mentioned particularly the
<HI>Journal des Savans,</HI> and a&s;ked John&s;on if it was well done. John&s;on &s;aid,
it was formerly very well done, and gave &s;ome account of the per&s;ons who
began it, and carried it on for &s;ome years; enlarging at the &s;ame time, on the
nature and u&s;e of &s;uch works. The King a&s;ked him if it was well done now.
John&s;on an&s;wered, he had no rea&s;on to think that it was. The King then
a&s;ked him if there were any other literary journals publi&s;hed in this kingdom,
except the Monthly and Critical Reviews; and on being an&s;wered there were
no other, his Maje&s;ty a&s;ked which of them was the be&s;t: John&s;on an&s;wered,
that the Monthly Review was done with mo&s;t care, the Critical upon the be&s;t
principles; adding, that the authours of the Monthly Review were enemies
to the Church. This the King &s;aid he was &s;orry to hear.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation next turned on the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, when
John&s;on ob&s;erved, that they had now a better method of arranging their
<PB N="7" REF="7">
materials than formerly. "Aye, (&s;aid the King,) they are obliged to Dr.
John&s;on for that;" for his Maje&s;ty had heard and remembered the circum|&s;tance,
which John&s;on him&s;elf had forgot.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to have the literary biography of this country
ably executed, and propo&s;ed to Dr. John&s;on to undertake it. John&s;on &s;ignified
his readine&s;s to comply with his Maje&s;ty's wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>During the whole of this interview, John&s;on talked to his Maje&s;ty with
profound re&s;pect, but &s;till in his firm manly manner, with a &s;onorous voice,
and never in that &s;ubdued tone which is commonly u&s;ed at the levee and in
the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, John&s;on &s;hewed him&s;elf highly
plea&s;ed with his Maje&s;ty's conver&s;ation and gracious behaviour. He &s;aid to
Mr. Barnard, "Sir, they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the
fine&s;t gentleman I have ever &s;een." And he afterwards ob&s;erved to Mr.
Langton, "Sir, his manners are tho&s;e of as fine a gentleman as we may
&s;uppo&s;e Lewis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second."</P>
<P>At Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, where a circle of John&s;on's friends was collected
round him to hear his account of this memorable conver&s;ation, Dr. Jo&s;eph
Warton, in his frank and lively manner, was very active in pre&s;&s;ing him to
mention the particulars. "Come now, Sir, this is an intere&s;ting matter; do
favour us with it." John&s;on, with great good humour, complied.</P>
<P>He told them, "I found his Maje&s;ty wi&s;hed I &s;hould talk, and I made
it my bu&s;ine&s;s to talk. I find it does a man good to be talked to by his
&s;overeign. In the fir&s;t place, a man cannot be in a pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;" Here &s;ome
que&s;tion interrupted him, which is to be regretted, as he certainly would
have pointed out and illu&s;trated many circum&s;tances of advantage, from being in
a &s;ituation, where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous
exertion, and tempered by reverential awe.</P>
<P>During all the time in which Dr. John&s;on was employed in relating to the
circle at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's the particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed between the
King and him, Dr. Gold&s;mith remained unmoved upon a &s;opha at &s;ome
di&s;tance, affecting not to join in the lea&s;t in the eager curio&s;ity of the com|pany.
He a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for his gloom and &s;eeming inattention, that he
apprehended John&s;on had relinqui&s;hed his purpo&s;e of furni&s;hing him with a
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Prologue to his play, with the hopes of which he had been flattered; but it
was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the
&s;ingular honour Dr. John&s;on had lately enjoyed. At length, the frankne&s;s
and &s;implicity of his natural character prevailed. He &s;prung from the &s;opha,
advanced to John&s;on, and in a kind of flutter, from imagining him&s;elf in the
&s;ituation which he had ju&s;t been hearing de&s;cribed, exclaimed, "Well, you
acquitted your&s;elf in this conver&s;ation better than I &s;hould have done; for I
&s;hould have bowed and &s;tammered through the whole of it."</P>
