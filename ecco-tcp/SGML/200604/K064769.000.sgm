<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ROM. v. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>GOD COMMENDETH HIS LOVE TOWARDS US, IN THAT, WHILE WE WERE YET SINNERS, CHRIST DIED FOR US.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE awful event, which we, this day, commemo|rate, is by far the mo&s;t important of any that ever took place upon the theatre of this world.</P>
<P>IT is that which, from the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of our fir&s;t pa|rents, a long line of prophets were commi&s;&s;ioned to pre|dict; which prie&s;ts and &s;acrifices were appointed to pre|figure, and which the revolutions of empires were con|trived to introduce: It is that which reconciled us unto GOD, re&s;cuing us from the tyranny of &s;in and the power of the grave. Yet in the whole go&s;pel there is nothing again&s;t which the pride of human rea&s;on, and the per|ver&s;ene&s;s of human prejudices have more ob&s;tinately op|po&s;ed them&s;elves, than the &s;acrifice of the everla&s;ting and equal SON of GOD as a full, perfect, and &s;ufficient &s;atis|faction for the &s;ins of the whole world.</P>
<P>In the very fir&s;t age of Chri&s;tianity, and while the precious blood of the world's Redeemer was yet recently &s;hed at Jeru&s;alem, there &s;prang up in the church a &s;ect, which, a&s;hamed of being the di&s;ciples of one who had been crucified as a malefactor, boldly affirmed that their
<PB N="6" REF="5">
Ma&s;ter had <HI>not</HI> &s;uffered; but that, without ta&s;ting death, he was taken up into heaven, whil&s;t Pilate and the Jews wreaked their impotent malice upon an airy phantom in his &s;imilitude.</P>
<P>To the&s;e heretics, after a few centuries &s;ucceeded the Impo&s;tor of Arabia&mdash;who, from motives of policy, de|nied the &s;ufferings of CHRIST. The great &s;cheme of univer&s;al redemption commenced with the fall, and its gracious de&s;ign was, by degrees, to re&s;tore mankind to that &s;tate which they had forfeited in Adam.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;agacious deceiver well knew that if the death and re&s;urrection were admitted, <HI>that</HI> de&s;ign would be &s;een to be completed; and that his <HI>own</HI> preten&s;ions of being divinely commi&s;&s;ioned to clo&s;e the &s;eal of prophecy, and to communicate the la&s;t offer of mercy and in&s;truc|tion to lap&s;ed humanity, mu&s;t in&s;tantly fall to the ground.</P>
<P>WITH an effrontery then peculiar to him&s;elf, he denied the truth of a fact on which Chri&s;tians repo&s;ed all their hopes, in which the Jews exulted with malicious triumph, and of which the hi&s;tory was &s;pread over the whole civilized world.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of Mahomet is well known, and it is likewi&s;e known that ever &s;ince his days the Chri&s;tian church has been infe&s;ted with a pe&s;tilent race of men, who, though they believe not in the in&s;piration of the Koran, and though they deny not the &s;ufferings of HIM, at who&s;e name St Paul directs that every knee &s;hould bow, yet do they lay no more <HI>&s;tre&s;s</HI> on tho&s;e &s;ufferings, than upon the &s;ufferings of <HI>Socrates</HI> or any other man who has laid down his life in atte&s;tation of the truth. If the Mahometan denies, like the Phantomi&s;t of more ancient
<PB N="7" REF="6" MS="y">
times, the <HI>reality</HI> of the death of CHRIST, the Socinian, by denying its <HI>efficacy,</HI> &s;inks it to the level of common martyrdom; and though the fact it&s;elf be <HI>not</HI> que&s;tioned, its <HI>end</HI> and <HI>de&s;ign</HI> is, in <HI>his</HI> creed, totally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE is a living writer, a teacher of the go&s;pel, and (if you will believe his adherents) a &s;incere Chri&s;tian, who &s;upports this horrid here&s;y with all his abilities, and who labours to di&s;&s;eminate it with a&s;toni&s;hing zeal; who&s;e followers are &s;cattered all over England, and <HI>again&s;t whom,</HI> as they in&s;inuate them&s;elves into every company and commonly make their attacks upon the ignorant and the half-learned, every Chri&s;tian ought to be upon his guard.</P>
<P>AGAINST Socinians, Arians, and all other enemies of the truth, the &s;ure&s;t defence will be found to be the &s;word of the Spirit, which is the word of GOD. Would mankind take their faith from the holy &s;criptures, and <HI>not</HI> re&s;t it upon the un&s;table foundation of human &s;y&s;tems, and would no man pre&s;umptuou&s;ly aim at being <Q REND="inline">wi&s;e beyond what is written,</Q> here&s;ies would &s;oon va|ni&s;h away.</P>
<P>BUT in&s;tead of pur&s;uing a conduct &s;o &s;uitable to blind and erring mortals, we find the teachers of Chri&s;tianity &s;plit into a thou&s;and &s;ects, and labouring <HI>each</HI> to &s;upport, by every art, and every &s;ophi&s;m, the particular tenets of his <HI>human</HI> leader.</P>
<P>THE followers of Calvin, who &s;tyle them&s;elves the orthodox, mo&s;t unwarrantably pre&s;ume to circum&s;cribe the goodne&s;s of GOD, when they confidently affirm that, although the &s;acrifice upon the cro&s;s made a &s;atisfaction of value &s;ufficient to ran&s;om a thou&s;and worlds, yet that however it was <HI>not</HI> offered for all mankind, but <HI>only</HI> for
<PB N="8" REF="7">
the <HI>elected few</HI>; and that <HI>all</HI> but tho&s;e <HI>few</HI> were ACCOR|DING TO THE UNSEARCHABLE COUNSEL OF GOD'S WILL AND FOR THE GLORY OF HIS SOVEREIGN POWER, PASSED BY AND ORDAINED TO DISHONOUR AND WRATH.</P>
<P>Now that any man, who loves his brethren who are upon earth, and entertains <HI>ju&s;t</HI> notions of his Father who is in heaven, &s;hould believe &s;uch doctrines as the&s;e, is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible: it is indeed always to be dreaded, le&s;t he upon whom in early youth the&s;e tenets have been inculcated as the truths of GOD, &s;hould by the pronene&s;s of mankind to run from one extreme to another, be led in the maturity of age, to deny the efficacy of CHRIST'S death <HI>altogether,</HI> and to attempt to bring down that ado|rable Per&s;on, from the dignity of the uncreated Redeemer of the world, to the level of an ordinary martyr.</P>
<P>SUCH was the origin and progre&s;s of the per&s;on, who is at pre&s;ent bu&s;ied in perverting the faith of the&s;e nations. He was educated, he informs us, in the firm per&s;ua&s;ion that the horrible opinions, which have been enumerated, are the doctrine of the <HI>prophets and apo&s;tles</HI>; and without giving him&s;elf the trouble (as it &s;hould &s;eem) to inquire whether the&s;e things be really &s;o, he has thought proper, in order to get rid of what in his riper years he finds it <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to <HI>believe,</HI> to abandon the in&s;piration of the Scriptures, and has not &s;crupled to call St Paul an inconclu&s;ive rea&s;oner.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;earch the bible from Gene&s;is to the book of St John's Revelation, we &s;hall not find any of its in|&s;pired writers <HI>pre&s;uming</HI> to &s;ay what the Almighty <HI>could or could not</HI> have done. God's ways are indeed often de|clared to be <Q REND="inline">pa&s;t finding out,</Q> but there is enough of
<PB N="9" REF="8">
them revealed to &s;atisfy us, that they are all founded in infinite wi&s;dom, that they all flow from perfect goodne&s;s, that he who made us is <Q REND="inline">no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons,</Q> that he will have <HI>all</HI> men to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, and that he commendeth his love towards us in that, <Q REND="inline">while were yet &s;inners, CHRIST died for us.</Q></P>
<P>The evangelical prophet teaches that <Q REND="inline">the &s;oul of the Me&s;&s;iah was made an offering for &s;in, that he was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and brui&s;ed for our ini|quity, that the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him, and that by his &s;tripes we are healed.</Q> And the great in&s;trument of the world's conver&s;ion informs us, <Q REND="inline">that GOD, even our Father, hath loved us and given us everla&s;ting con&s;olation through grace; that CHRIST al&s;o hath loved us, and given him&s;elf for us an offer|ing and a &s;acrifice unto GOD for a &s;weet &s;melling fa|vour,</Q> and St Peter adds that <Q REND="inline">there is none <HI>other</HI> name under heaven, given among men, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved.</Q> Neither Prophets nor Apo&s;tles pre|&s;ume to limit this great and glorious, and ON GOD'S PART THIS FINISHED, &s;alvation to a <HI>cho&s;en</HI> few: on the contrary, we are expre&s;sly taught, that our Redeemer <Q REND="inline">gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for <HI>all,</HI> that he was made a little lower than the angels, that by the grace of GOD he &s;hould ta&s;te of death for <HI>every man</HI>; that the LORD is long &s;uffering towards us, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that <HI>all</HI> &s;hould come to repentance.</Q> In the volume of in&s;piration we learn, concerning the ble&s;&s;ed Friend of &s;inners, <Q REND="inline">that in him dwelleth all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily,</Q> and this is a faith|ful &s;aying (intended to exhilarate alike the hearts of all
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Adam's &s;ons) that CHRIST <HI>promi&s;ed,</HI> JESUS <HI>exhibited,</HI> came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, <HI>without any exception whatever, whether of per&s;ons or ca&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH being the infinite love of GOD to mankind in CHRIST JESUS, we cannot wonder that when fir&s;t ma|nife&s;ted to the world, it produced its proper effects, that it put an end to all &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and divi&s;ion; and indeed under the real influence, and full belief of this great my|&s;tery of divine love, there &s;eems to be no room left for any thing el&s;e among&s;t Chri&s;tians, but returns of love to GOD, and emanations of love towards one another.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY one would think, needs but to be <HI>fairly</HI> &s;tated in order to its being found worthy of uni|ver&s;al acceptation as an act of grace, &s;ealed with the royal &s;ignet of heaven, propo&s;ing and providing the <HI>Se|cond</HI> Adam, as a &s;econd parent or proxy for lap&s;ed man|kind immediately when the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Adam had, without our con&s;ent, forfeited the ine&s;timable privilege of a glorious immortality. Our holy religion, when attentively con&s;i|dered in this true point of light will ever be found equally comfortable, delightful and intere&s;ting to men of all de&s;criptions, every individual of which is on the Chri&s;tian plan re-admitted to the &s;ame covenant of grace with GOD that Adam him&s;elf enjoyed in paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>PERSONS who meditate with frequency and attention upon the&s;e glad tidings will not fail to experience their efficacy to fill agreeably the vacuity of human life. When our &s;pirits droop, the&s;e truths of GOD will chear them. When the &s;tings of con&s;cience torment us, if we be truly penitent, <HI>they</HI> will di&s;pel our fears, confirm and augment our hopes, di&s;arm the king of terrors, and will open a joyous pro&s;pect, beyond the grave, into the heavenly
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Canaan and the new Jeru&s;alem; in which city of our reconciled Father there are man&s;ions, many man&s;ions, for receiving them <Q REND="inline">who, through faith, and patient continuance in well-doing, &s;eek for glory and immor|tality.</Q></P>
<P>THE plain and numerous declarations of holy writ, on this &s;ubject, militate &s;o forcibly again&s;t the Calvini&s;t, who denies the <HI>univer&s;ality</HI> of CHRIST'S &s;atisfaction, as well as again&s;t the Socinian, who denies that &s;atisfaction <HI>altogether,</HI> that it would be a&s;toni&s;hing how either of tho&s;e &s;ects &s;hould have gained ground in the world, did not daily experience evince that mankind are more ready to torture every thing into an agreement with their own pre-conceived opinions, than to try the truth of tho&s;e opinions by the word of GOD.</P>
<P>BUT if CHRIST died for <HI>all</HI> men, why (it may be a&s;ked) have we not rea&s;on to expect that <HI>all</HI> men &s;hall be <HI>&s;aved?</HI> Is it not detracting from the merits of the great &s;acrifice of this day to &s;uppo&s;e that it was offered for any <HI>one</HI> per&s;on who &s;hall not <HI>ultimately</HI> reap all the <HI>benefits</HI> which it was intended to purcha&s;e? By no means! The ob&s;tinate rejection of CHRIST'S go&s;pel by an incorrigible &s;inner may make <HI>him mi&s;erable,</HI> but the rejection cannot detract either from the <HI>mercy</HI> of the Father or from the <HI>merits</HI> of the Son. There have been in&s;tances, (and among&s;t our own fellow &s;ubjects and in the pa&s;&s;ing cen|tury) of men redeemed from &s;lavery, who have yet re|fu&s;ed to quit the place of their captivity, and who <HI>de|feated,</HI> though &s;urely without <HI>le&s;&s;ening,</HI> the beneficence of him who paid their &s;tipulated ran&s;om. It is even &s;o with us. The full price of our redemption from &s;in and Satan has been paid, but if we <HI>refu&s;e</HI> to <HI>change</HI> our
<PB N="12" REF="11">
ma&s;ters; if we <HI>will</HI> not <HI>accept</HI> the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of GOD, when offered to us <Q REND="inline">without money and without price,</Q> our ruin mu&s;t be imputed to our&s;elves, and not to our <HI>merciful Creator,</HI> who de&s;ires not the mi&s;ery of his creatures, nor to our adorable Redeemer <Q REND="inline">who gave his life a ran&s;om for all.</Q></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t great purpo&s;e for which CHRIST died was to pay the penalty of our fir&s;t parent's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, to re&s;|cue us from the everla&s;ting power of the grave, and to put us anew into a capacity of obtaining and of reli&s;hing that happine&s;s, in the <HI>next</HI> world which is to be con&s;idered as in &s;ome &s;ort the <HI>natural</HI> effect of holine&s;s in <HI>this.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST our pa&s;&s;over, by his own oblation of him&s;elf once offered, hath without any co-operation of ours, completed this mighty work; for <Q REND="inline">as in Adam all die, even &s;o in CHRIST &s;hall <HI>all,</HI> even the <HI>wicked</HI> as well as the <HI>righteous,</HI> be made <HI>alive</HI>;</Q> but, <HI>ob&s;erve,</HI> the righteous only &s;hall ri&s;e to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed LORD &s;uffered to redeem us from death and to purcha&s;e for us the grace of the go&s;pel covenant, but it was no part of <HI>his</HI> de&s;ign, nor is it any part of <HI>that</HI> covenant, to cancel the eternal obligations of <HI>piety and virtue. The&s;e</HI> were in force before man fell&mdash;they are equally in force now that he is redeemed, and by them &s;hall we be tried at that great day, for which all other days were made. For tribulation and angui&s;h, &s;aith the book of truth, mu&s;t be <Q REND="inline">the portion of every &s;oul of man that doth evil, of the Jew fir&s;t and al&s;o of the Gentile.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH is the nature of the redemption wrought by CHRIST, &s;uch the gracious terms of that covenant of mercy, which by his precious blood&s;hedding, he hath ob|tained
<PB N="13" REF="12">
for us. This is <HI>all</HI> that is expre&s;sly revealed con|cerning it, and it is <HI>all</HI> that we are required to <HI>believe.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the di&s;proportion between a finite and an infi|nite mind it &s;eems improbable that, even in heaven it&s;elf, the <HI>one</HI> &s;hould ever be in circum&s;tances to judge of <HI>all</HI> the proceedings of <HI>the other</HI>; becau&s;e a <HI>certain</HI> judgment of the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of GOD (any more than of <HI>any other</HI> governor) cannot be formed from a <HI>partial</HI> view of his di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>CHRIST really was, <HI>all</HI> that the Mo&s;aic ritual exhi|bited in types, and in&s;tead of having been a &s;acrifice <HI>only</HI> in figure; all the &s;acrifices which preceded him were merely figurative of Him.</P>
<P>CHRIST is &s;tiled our Pa&s;&s;over&mdash;He is &s;aid to have been &s;acrificed for us, and we may rea&s;onably conclude that without a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for &s;uch a proce&s;s, it would never have exi&s;ted. Now if CHRIST is <HI>our</HI> Pa&s;&s;over, <HI>His</HI> blood mu&s;t do for us what the blood of the pa&s;chal lamb did for the Hebrews in Egypt; but that blood was <HI>expiatory,</HI> and therefore, &s;o is <HI>Chri&s;t's.</HI></P>
<P>BELIEVE not then, I pray you, <HI>a&s;&s;ertions,</HI> however confident, that &s;uch an atonement was <HI>altogether needle&s;s,</HI> and that therefore the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which &s;eem to teach it, are nothing more than <HI>metaphorical ex|pre&s;&s;ions.</HI> But rather reflect that you are taught by uner|ring wi&s;dom concerning the redemption of your &s;ouls, that it is a my&s;tery into which even the <HI>angels</HI> (who &s;urely knew more of the divine coun&s;els than the mo&s;t acute Socinian on earth) <HI>de&s;ire to look,</HI> and do not <HI>fully comprehend,</HI> and therefore <HI>we</HI> may well re&s;t contented with the plain, though narrow view of it, which is laid before us. <HI>Prying</HI> into this my&s;tery, like gazing on the &s;un, begins in <HI>pain,</HI> and ends in <HI>blindne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
IT mu&s;t &s;urely be granted, that forgivene&s;s of &s;in on account of the vicarious &s;ufferings of our ble&s;&s;ed LORD is indeed a method admirably calculated at once to repre&s;s pre&s;umption, to di&s;courage men from repeating their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, to give them a deep &s;en&s;e of the odiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in, and to convince them of the excellency of the divine laws, and the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of paying a willing obedience to them.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;pen&s;ation <Q REND="inline">mercy and truth are met toge|ther, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other,</Q> and whil&s;t a guilty world was received into the divine favour, the mo&s;t awful warning was held out to <HI>that</HI> world&mdash;and, indeed, to the whole intelligent creation, which it was po&s;&s;ible even for <HI>Omnipotence it&s;elf</HI> to <HI>give.</HI></P>
<P>IF after having &s;een our Saviour, in the garden, de|precating in vain that fearful cup which <HI>we</HI> had <HI>de&s;erved</HI>; if after having beheld him hanging on the cro&s;s, and heard him in the agony of his &s;oul crying out, <Q REND="inline">MY GOD, MY GOD, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</Q> If, after all this, we can &s;till continue <HI>unmoved,</HI> it does not appear probable that we &s;hould be per&s;uaded to for&s;ake our &s;ins and follow our Saviour, by a pro&s;pect either of the joyful effects of piety, or the mi&s;erable con&s;equences of guilt; and how, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, can we hope to <Q REND="inline">e&s;cape wretchedne&s;s in the extreme, if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT then remains but that (in the &s;trength of our ever-ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer) we <Q REND="inline">ca&s;t away from us all our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions whereby we have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and make us a new heart and a new &s;pirit,</Q> that &s;o we may, on the approaching fe&s;tival, receive the holy communion
<PB N="15" REF="14">
of the body and blood of our Saviour CHRIST, with a full tru&s;t in GOD'S mercy, and with a quiet con&s;cience.</P>
<P>WHAT <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our <HI>repentance</HI> is weak and unworthy, and fit to be <HI>repented</HI> of, and all our <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is as <HI>filthy rags.</HI> How then dare we appear in the pre&s;ence of GOD! there is nothing before us but <HI>condemnation!</HI> there is nothing in our|&s;elves whence any <HI>comfort</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> can ari&s;e! all is <HI>darkne&s;s.</HI> But, as the <HI>&s;erpent</HI> was lifted up in the wilderne&s;s, &s;o ought we to look by <HI>faith</HI> unto our great <HI>High-prie&s;t</HI> who was lifted up upon the cro&s;s for us, <Q REND="inline">that whoever <HI>believeth</HI> in him &s;hould have <HI>eternal life</HI>;</Q> and although our <HI>faith</HI> be weak, yet, for our comfort be it remembered, the <HI>virtue</HI> is not in our faith, which is merely the <HI>band</HI> that reaches the medicine to us. The whole <HI>virtue</HI> is in the <HI>medicine,</HI> in the all-&s;ufficient &s;atisfaction which EMANUEL has made for us, in his own <HI>per&s;on,</HI> wholly without us, though applied inwardly by <HI>faith,</HI> which it&s;elf is al&s;o the gift of GOD.</NOTE> remains, but that we &s;hould this day <Q REND="inline">return unto the LORD our GOD, for he is gracious and mer|ciful, &s;low to anger, and repents him of the evil.</Q></P>
<P>WE believe, Lord, help thou our unbelief. Father, we have &s;inned again&s;t heaven and before thee, and are no more worthy to be called thy &s;ons. But thou art the &s;ame Lord who&s;e property is always to have mercy and to forgive, grant us therefore, gracious Lord, when&s;oever we approach thy holy table, <HI>&s;o</HI> to eat the fle&s;h of thy dear Son JESUS CHRIST, and to drink his blood, that our &s;inful bodies may be made clean by his body, and our &s;ouls wa&s;hed through his mo&s;t precious blood, and that we may evermore dwell in him and he in us!</P>
<P>Now unto GOD that loved us and hath given us everla&s;ting con&s;olation through grace&mdash;unto the holy and undivided Trinity&mdash;to Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t be a&s;cribed equal honour by the church militant on earth and triumphant in heaven.</P>
