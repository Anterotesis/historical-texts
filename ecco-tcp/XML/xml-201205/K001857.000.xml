<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> HAVE frequently taken notice of the <HI>Medicine Chests</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In furnishing Medicine Chests, particular regard must be had to the different climates; and to the disorders that are most prevalent in those countries.—The same in Tra∣velling Chests.—Each person, knowing their own constitu∣tion, will endeavour to accomodate themselves accordingly.</NOTE> in the cabinet-shops, some containing <HI>six</HI> bottles, some <HI>nine,</HI> and some <HI>twelve;</HI> others larger, with drawers to hold different Medicines; which are extremely convenient in any exigency, and would be more universally made use of, if a simple and safe plan could be adopted: and I think it is a pity no person has ever given a hint how to fur∣nish those small ones. There are frequently adver∣tised large Chests, the plan of which I do not alto∣gether approve of; because, when a persons buys one, and takes it many miles in the country, and is out of the several Medicines, he is obliged to send up to the first proprietor, otherwise they can∣not have the same; therefore all Medicines in the Chests should bear the title of the <HI>London Dispen∣satory,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>as directed by the College of Physicians, unless there may be something added more efficacious; and then the Recipe should be given, or say where it is taken from.—I do not mean to enter largely on the Dispensatory, as those have done; but only to endeavour at a scheme for furnishing small ones, from 1 <HI>l.</HI> 1 <HI>s.</HI> to about 4 <HI>l.</HI> 4 <HI>s.</HI> each, first cost; (persons suiting their own stations;) to be ready at any time when any sudden illness should seize any of the family.</P>
<P>The necessity of such a plan is too obvious, espe∣cially when we consider the many accidents human nature is subject to; in which, without immediate help, we are either lost, or kept in great pain; which would be in a great measure prevented, if masters or mistresses of families would keep a small Chest by them; and particularly those who reside in a country village, often many miles from a town where an Apothecary is to be met with.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to select such Medicines as I think necessary, and choose those chiefly which the the College of Physicians have ordered the Apothe∣caries to keep in their shops; that, by asking for the Medicines by their names, you will always have the right, if you deal with a person of credit.— I will not recommend any Medicine where there may be danger in it, without pointing it out likwise. Electuaries, on account they are so disagreeable to take, I leave out; as I can always substitute some∣thing more agreeable in a liquid; and, as my design is to curtail Physic, I shall chiefly confine myself to those Medicines that lie in a small compass, whose virtues I have often so happily experienced.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<P>At my first writing of this, I had no thoughts of offering my service to the public, to furnish those small Chests; but, if any person is desirous of my service, I will very readily give my advice, and explain more particularly the Recipes, and Nature of the Medicines, and take care they shall be sup∣plied with the best of them: And, as I am the first who has endeavoured to make these small Chests universal, without any reserve; I hope, at least, I may meet with candour; and any hints that will improve the whole will be gratefully received, By</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR FURNISHING MEDICINE CHESTS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE, in the course of this work, exceeded the bounds I, at first, intended; and have taken notice of several Medicines, which are useful on particular occasions, (and which the public may be furnished with, if they think proper) though not absolutely necessary to be kept in every house. The small Chests, with a few bottles, will ever be found the most serviceable; the use of which I most strongly plead for, without interest; as I am intirely against any secret nostrums being put in; and hope no one will encourage any such practices.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="materia medica">
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<P>As Medicine Chests are made of different sizes, each person may adopt which they please: the first, nine, or twelve, I particularly recom∣mend to every family. Those who keep the whole will have a very good Apothecary's shop; and a Physician or Apothecary may make a good Medicine up quickly, to suit any exigency. I have omitted the Bark, and several other valu∣able Medicines, because there is time sufficient to procure them, when wanted: and, first, for Colds and Coughs, is</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>ELIXIR PAREGORIC.</HEAD>
<P>This excellent Elixir was invented by Le Mort, a French Surgeon, and was called the Elixir Asthmatic. It is a Medicine of great efficacy
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>in fresh Colds or Coughs, and may be given to children in the Chin-Cough, commonly called the Whooping-Cough. Dose, a tea-spoonful, (not more) going to bed. Grown people may take more, up to a tea-spoonful and a half. It is a gentle opiate.</P>
<TAILNOTE>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<P>N. B. Persons who are subject to a bad Cough, of long standing, and Shortness of Breath, must take care not to meddle with it, an account of the Opium in it, which would almost choak them. When a person has got a Cold, they should put on a double night-cap, and a woollen stock∣ing round their neck. Children are frequently troubled with a Cough that proceeds from eating trash, which occa∣sions tough phlegm to be lodged in the stomach: in that case, or where it is a Whooping-Cough, a gentle vomit of Ipecacoanha wine, (dose, two drams, in any pleasant liquor, for a child of six years old) may be given; or a gentle purge; as, Take manna, half an ounce; dissolve it in a cup of tea; and add Tincture of Jalap, one tea-spoonful: but, where Worms are suspected, a dose of Basilicon Powder must be given.</P>
<P>Observe, in taking of Medicines, to begin with a small dose, and so increase or diminish as you find them operate: by this you will discover what is commonly called the Con∣stitution. In Fevers this should be given very sparingly, as it will rather increase the heat.</P>
</TAILNOTE>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>BALSAM ANODYNE.</HEAD>
<P>This is a valuable composition. It cures fresh Aches and Pains, arising from Colds, almost to a wonder. Those who are troubled with the Gout, or Rheumatism, must use Opodeldoc.</P>
<P>It likewise cures the Tooth and Head-Ach, and is the basis of those Tinctures advertised. For Outward Pains, rub half an ounce well in before the fire, and wear a flannel. For Ner∣vous Cholics, or Gravelly Complaints, it is some∣times used. Dose, twenty drops to sixty, for a grown person. This is a stronger Opiate than the former.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>BALSAM TRAUMATIC, OR, BAUME DE COMMANDEUR.</HEAD>
<P>This is similar to the Fryar's and Turlington's Balsam, and is used for the same purposes, viz. Fresh Cuts. It is good for inward Decays, and tickling Coughs. As it is so generally known, I shall not say any more to recommend it. It is rather thinner than the advertised Medi∣cines, but no ways inferior.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>SOOT DROPS, OR, TINCTURE OF SOOT.</HEAD>
<P>Where children are these Drops should always be at hand; there is not any Medicine of so great efficacy as this is in bringing people out of Fits, when properly applied. I have known a grown person seized with Fits, which before used to hold an hour, and could not be brought to her∣self by any of those cruel, mis-judged methods very often made use of by strangers, as forcing open the hands, pinching, burning, &amp;c. which is wrong. My method was, to pour a pap-spoon∣ful of these Drops down the Patient's throat by itself, and almost immediately they would reco∣ver; if not, I gave the second, which seldom failed; indeed, I never knew it to fail. It is a safe Medicine for children from one to four years old: I lower it for them by mixing two or three parts water with it, as one tea-spoonful of Drops and three of water; when children either purge or vomit, the danger is over: rubbing their limbs and soles of the feet is good. The best preserva∣tive against Fits is an Issue, and purge off the acids with Magnesia and Rhubarb. In Lethargy Fits, a strong vomit must be forced down, as the Wine of Antimony, the Sal Vitriol; these two last Medicines require judgement.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> STYPTIC TINCTURE.</HEAD>
<P>As sometimes accidents happen by breaking a blood-vessel, or too great an effusion of blood, I have thought proper to recommend this to be kept ready, and will answer all the end of the celebrated Styptic of Helvetius or Eaton. Dip a piece of cloth in it, and apply to the part.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>SPIRIT OF ROSEMARY, OTHERWISE, HUNGARY WATER. SIMPLE SPIRIT OF LAVENDER.</HEAD>
<P>Both of these, when made in perfection, are very grateful and fragrant: they are frequently rubbed on the temples, &amp;c. under the notion of refreshing and comforting the nerves; and like∣wise taken internally, to the quantity of two or three tea-spoonfuls, as warm cordials, in wine, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>WINE OF IPECACOHANA, COMMONLY CALLED, <HI>The</HI> SACK VOMIT.</HEAD>
<P>It is mild, safe, and serviceable in Dysenteries: The Powder of Ipecacohana is best for small Chests. Dose of the Wine for a child six years old is six drams, in Powder four grains; grow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>people one ounce and a half of the Wine, and in Powder ten grains.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>HARTSHORN DROPS.</HEAD>
<P>Their use is well known. Dose from ten Drops to sixty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>SALTS OF HARTSHORN.</HEAD>
<P>The dose is from a grain or two to ten or twelve.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>TINCTURE OF MARTIAL FLOWERS, OR OF IRON.</HEAD>
<P>People who live at a distance from chalybeat waters may supply themselves by substituting this Tincture, by dropping from ten to twenty drops in any vehicle twice or thrice a day.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>SWEET SPIRIT OF NITRE.</HEAD>
<P>A pleasant, cooling, diuretic Medicine. Dose from ten to fifty drops. Good in Fevers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> SWEET SPIRIT OF VITRIOL, ACID ELIXIR OF VITRIOL, AND SWEET ELIXIR OF VITRIOL,</HEAD>
<P>Are often used, on particular occasions, for weakness and relaxations of the Stomach, and decays of Constitution.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> VOLATILE TINCTURE OF VALERIAN.</HEAD>
<P>Is a very good hysteric Medicine in nervous cases and lowness of spirits. Dose, three times a day, from one to two tea-spoonfuls in a glass of any liquor, as wine, or wine and water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>TINCTURE OF JALAP.</HEAD>
<P>Is a useful, safe purgative; if it had not that burning heat in the throat, it would not be un∣pleasant: It is handy to mix in small quantities in any effusion, especially for children, whose aver∣sion to Physic creates much trouble. Dose for children six years old a small tea-spoonful; grown people two spoonfuls, in any liquor. Jalap is frequently used in Scurvy-grass, and concen∣trated juices sold as Quack Medicines, and when dropped in water or beer turns whitish.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>STOMACHIC ELIXIR, OTHERWISE, STOUGHTON's ELIXIR.</HEAD>
<P>Take of
<LIST>
<ITEM>Gentian root two ounces,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Orange peel one ounce,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Virginian snake-root half an ounce,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cochineal half a dram,</ITEM>
<ITEM>French brandy two pints.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Let them steep for three days, then filter the Elixir.—This safe Medicine, being so generally known, needs no further comment. Dose from one to four tea-spoonfuls, in any liquor.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>TINCTURE OF SENA, OR, DAFFY's ELIXIR.</HEAD>
<P>This mixture is warm and comfortable to the stomach and bowels, and somewhat proper in cholic complaints, and for the wind. Dose for grown persons one ounce or two; if given to children, lower the dose, as it is too hot for their tender mouths.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>SPIRITS OF WINE AND CAMPHOR</HEAD>
<P>Is very handy for sprains, inflammations, dis∣cussing tumours, preventing gangreens, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>LIQUID LAUDANUM, OR, THEBAIC TINCTURE, <HI>An</HI> OPIATE.</HEAD>
<P>A good Medicine in skilful hands, but very dangerous in ignorant. The white Syrup of Poppies is a very good opiate, and not so dan∣gerous. Peppermint-water, sweetened with this Syrup, is good to stop vomiting, or an over purging. One grain of Laudanum in substance is equal to thirty drops of the liquid for strength.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>BITTER TINCTURE.</HEAD>
<P>Is handy for those who like to drink it in wine, or make purl of it; is very safe, and helps di∣gestion. Dose thirty to sixty drops.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> AROMATIC TINCTURE</HEAD>
<P>Is a very warm Medicine for weakness of the stomach, in languors and flatulencies, and other like complaints. Dose a tea-spoonful or two in a glass of wine, or wine and water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>HUXHAM's WINE OF ANTIMONY</HEAD>
<P>I prefer to that directed by the College of Physicians: it is a noble Medicine. In proper hands good to be given against the Small-pox, as
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>a preparative for Inoculation, for coughs as an alterative and diaphoretic, and apoplectic cases. None ought to meddle with it but with great care. Dose for a child eight years old one tea-spoonful in a glass of water, grown people two; three is a large dose, it vomits very strong. Rectified Spirits of Wine, pou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed on the glass of Antimony, will neither vomit nor purge, and is the basis of Norris's and Rysseeg's Medicines.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>SPIRIT OF LAVENDER COMPOUND.</HEAD>
<P>This is the red drops of Lavender, very good to snuff up the nose when you have got cold: it comforts the head, and raises the spirits. Dose from twenty to sixty drops, on sugar or in wine and water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD><HI>An</HI> IMITATION OF BAUME DE VIE.</HEAD>
<P>Take of the Sacred Tincture two ounces, of the Stomach Tincture one ounce, Syrup of Saf∣fron two drams, mixed. This is a very pleasant, safe, easy purge, and no ways inferior to that boasted Medicine "Baume de Vie" in it's vir∣tues. Try and believe.</P>
<P>Observe, People that are troubled with the Piles must not meddle with aloetic Medicines, as this and the Baume de Vie, likewise Scotch Pills.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>JESUITS DROPS, OR, BALSAMIC TINCTURE.</HEAD>
<P>Take Balsam of Capivi one ounce, Gum Guiacum two drams, Balsam of Peru four drams, Oil of Sassafras two scruples, Salt of Tartar twelve grains, rectified Spirits of Wine nine ounces: digest them together for four days, and pour off what is fine for use. This is partly taken from Le Mort, who gave the Proprietor the first hint. It is an admirable warm Medicine, and a pity it is not more known in some cases: it has long been advertised for curing a certain disorder, which it will not cure.

They dissolve likewise in spirits of wine, the more fragrant in an equal weight, and almost all of them in less than four times their own quantity.

Syrups and distilled waters were for some ages made use of as the great alteratives, insomuch that the evacuation of any peccant humour was never attempted till, by a due course of these, it had first been regu∣larly prepared for expulsion: hence arose the ex∣uberant collection of both which we meet with in Pharmacopoeias, and like errors have pre∣vailed in each. As multitudes of distilled waters have been compounded from materials unfit to give any virtue over the helm, so numbers of Syrups have been prepared of ingredients which, in this form, cannot be taken in sufficient doses to exert their virtues; for two-thirds of a Syrup consist of sugar, and greatest part of the remain∣ing third is an aqueous fluid. Syrups are at pre∣sent chiefly regarded as convenient vehicles for Medicines of greater efficacy, and made use of for sweetening Draughts and Juleps; for reducing the lighter Powders into Boluses, Pills, or Elec∣tuaries; and other like purposes.

<HEAD>DIAPHORETIC JULEP.</HEAD>
<P>Take Alexterical-water four ounces, Spirit of Minderous two ounces, Salt of Hartshorn ten grains, White Sugar six drams, mix them for a Julep. This excellent composition is a very powerful sudorific, and answers its intentions more effectually, and with greater certainty, than many others calculated for the same pur∣pose. Where a copious sweat is to be excited, as in rheumatic diseases, two spoons full are to be taken warm in bed every hour, or two hours, till the sweat breaks out; if warm diluting liquors are not sufficient to keep it up, the same is to be occasionally repeated.</P>

<P>Take of Camomoile Flower Water six grains, Emetic Tartar ten grains, Syrup of Buckthorn two ounces mix them together. Two spoons full of this Julep are given in hydropic cases every two hours, till it takes sufficient effect, as a purgative, which it generally does before the quantity here prescribed has been made use of. Emetic Tartar thus exhibited, in small doses, and frequently repeated, proves as certain and powerful a cathartic, as it does an emetic, when given in a larger quantity at once.
