<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE kind Reception this Book has met with from the Publick, appears by nothing more than the quick Sale of the former Editions: There have not been many Physick Books, in Respect to the large Number that have been publish'd, of which Three Thousand Copies have in so short a Time been dispos'd of; but its having been well received, and so much call'd for, since out of <HI>Print,</HI> is not the only Motive of reprinting it; the great good the Medicines prescribed in it have done and daily do to abundance of People afflicted with Diseases of the <HI>Head, Brain,</HI> and <HI>Nerves,</HI> as also to those oppress'd with <HI>Me∣lancholly</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> is another of much greater weight; for it being reasonable to believe there are many hundreds of Persons troubled with those Diseases, who have not yet seen it, and who by reading it may meet with their Cure, as vast Numbers have already done, I thought my self for their Sakes, as well as my own Advantage, o∣bliged to send it again to the Press; and upon looking it over carefully with that Intention, I did not find occasion for any very material Additions, and therefore omitted some of slight Consequence I might have made, purely because those who have bought the other Editions, might not think themselves impos'd upon or be obliged to buy this Fourth, which for that Reasonis sent into the World again exactly as before, some very few Corrections excepted.</P>
<P>Of all the Diseases incident to Mankind, there are none more dangerous and mortal than those of the <HI>Head,</HI> and <HI>Brain,</HI> and this my Experience in the Cure of those Diseases has convinced me of, tho' I must do my self Ju∣stice in declaring, that I have had as few Patients mis∣carryed, considering the Number I have in my Time at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended, as perhaps any Physician before me: And have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ured some who have been so very bad, through delay or
<PB REF="4"/>improper Medicines, that there was scarce a Probability of restoring. The Melancholly Circumstances of Persons so afflicted, is matter of great Concern, because we daily find ignorant Men, who would be thought Doctors, tampering in those Diseases, as if there were no danger in them at all; but this in our days is but what was in the days of our Predecessors, tho' more now than then, the Art of Physick being surely never more abused than at this time, and that because there is no Punishment inflicted on them besides Reproach, which they so little care for, that from their wonted Assurance they nothing less than laugh at.</P>
<P>The mature Consideration of this, and the Mischiefs I my self have seen in my Practice, by insignificant or impro∣per Medicines and Management, together with the Success I have had in many desperate Diseases of the <HI>Head,</HI> first put me upon writing this Treatise, this Fourth Edition of which, I am in hopes will be as kindly accepted by those so afflicted, as I am sure they will upon Tryal find the Methods and Medicines directed to, answer what is said of them.</P>
<P>The Title Page tells you, It is a Treatise of Diseases of the <HI>Head, Brain,</HI> and <HI>Nerves;</HI> and so it is, but as the Eyes, Nose, Tongue, Teeth, Gums, Jaws and Palate, go to the making up of the Head, the Reader may expect perhaps, I have treated of them also, which he will not find done, and that because it was no way material here, any further than that in Chapter the 12th, where I speak of Catarrhs or Defluxions, I have shewn how those Hu∣mours affect those Parts, and that many times by the remo∣ving those Humours, those Parts are relieved.</P>
<P>To this Treatise of Diseases of the <HI>Head,</HI> I have subjoined a Discourse on <HI>Melancholly</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> which tho' they are not properly Head Diseases, yet bear such analogy to them, or at least so far affect either the <HI>Head, Brain, Nerves,</HI> or all, that they come properly e∣nough to be considered here; and I perswade my self the
<PB REF="5"/>Account given of them, will not fall very, short of any Performance of the like Nature, at leastwise as to the main thing, I mean, the Curative Part, which however, will be better understood upon the Patient's Experience than by any thing I can say.</P>
<P>I had put my Name and Place of Habitation to this Book, but that I foresaw it might not be so well as let alone in this censorious Age, therefore resolved against it, not that I have any reason, I thank God, to conceal my self, or need be ashamed either of one or the other; but to supply that want, I have taken Care to make what I have written the more Plain and Intelligible, having, in each Disease, not only prescrib'd what Methods are to be ob∣served, and Medicines I have found useful to many, but also directed, at the end of the Book, where those pe∣culiar ones I have prescribed in it, and always found to stand me in stead on the most urgent Occasions are to be had, I me an by those who do not understand how, or care not to take the trouble of preparing them themselves; which by being taken and used at the Book directs, will by the Help of God, work a perfect Cure, and the Patients have no Occasion to trouble either themselves or me, for any further Advice or Direction.</P>
<P>This I thought good to hint, with an Assurance that what is written about the several Distempers, is what the Patients afflicted, too truely find, and also that the Re∣medies for Cure, are well adapted, replete with Power to effect what is said of them, and which I have the Vanity to believe, the Patient will, in some measure, give Credit to, upon the bear reading what he will find written, tho' I am not so weak as to expect anything that is or can be said of them, will or can convince him like his making Tryal of them himself, my Encomiums on 'em, falling far short of what his own Experiencing will prove they deserve. Therefore the Reader is desired to suspend his Opinion of the Book and Medicines, till he has Read the
<PB REF="6"/>former, and Tryed the latter, whatever he judges of the Author, who conceives, let what will be said or thought of him, by the Method he has taken to serve the Publick and Himself, if matters not, if what is said and recom∣mended in the Book, answer but the Patient's End.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE OF DISEASES OF THE Head; Brain <HI>and</HI> Nerves.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Head-Ach</HEAD>
<P>THERE are Two sorts of Head-ach, the Recent or New, and Inveterate or Old Head-ach: The former lasts but for a time only; and is either from Cold, hard Drinking, heat of the Sun, violent Exercise, or the like; and goes away as those Occasions wear off. The other is constant or lasting, with
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>very little abatement or intermission, is hard to be eas'd, and which on light Occasions, has Extream sharp Fits, so that the Patient cannot endure any Noise or vehement Motion, or scarce any Light, but desires to lye in the Dark, and be still; for Noise, if it be great, renders him almost craz'd. But tho', as in some, the Inveterate, or Old Head-ach, con∣tinues always more or less, in others, it goes away and returns by Fits.</P>
<P>They are both understood by the same common Name of the Heach-ach, but are vastly different as to Cure, the first going away upon the occasion ceasing, as I have already said, the other, being of long standing, is inveterate, and with difficulty removed; it being caused either thro' much Blood, Disorder of the Stomach, or sharp Humours con∣tained within or without the Skull, inflaming the Head, and depraving the Sense. If the Pain be attended with Heaviness, it comes of Plenitude: If with pricking and shooting, it proceeds from sharp Cholerick Humours: If the Head seems distended without Heaviness and Beating, Wind is the Cause; but if with Beating, there is Inflammation in the Films of the Brain: If there be a Heaviness with Distention, it shews Plenitude of Humours within the Films: If the Pain be outward, it is in the Films that cover the Scull; but if inward, and at the Roots of the Eyes, the Films that cover the Brain are griev'd. The external Pain is in the <HI>Pe∣ricranium</HI> or the Membrane without the Scull, and comes for the most part from external Cold, because a cold part will easily suffer from the like Quality; the internal Pain is always in the <HI>Meninges</HI> or in∣ternal Membranes.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<P>But as the Head-ach, inveterate or old, proceeds chiefly from inward Causes, either from some fault in the Head it self, or disorder of the Stomach, I shall speak only of that, the recent Head-ach, as already said, going away of it self upon a little Rest and Regularity, without any Medicines.</P>
<P>If the Pain proceeds from the Head essentially, there will be no Intermission, but a continual Pain, or if the Pain does remit, it is but for a little time, and returneth again.</P>
<P>If it proceeds from the Stomach, the Pain will of∣ten cease, and return again; also the Appetite will decay, especially if the Stomach abounds much with Flegm; but if the Stomach abounds much with Choller, there will be a Bitterness in the Mouth, a gnawing Pain of the Stomach, a <HI>Nausea</HI> or loathing of Food, trembling of the Heart and In∣flammation, which are much increased after sleep.</P>
<P>If the Head-ach proceeds from the Head essentially, I always give my following Cephalick purging Pills, which never fail moving off those Humours that infest the Brain and its <HI>Meninges,</HI> whereby the Pa∣tient has instant ease.</P>
<P>But when the Head-ach proceeds from the Sto∣mach, I ever give my Emetick Pouder, presently to be prescrib'd, which gently and safely, yet thorough, ly, evacuates the offending Cause, and sets the Pa∣tient to rights, more especially if in each Case my Cephalick Elixir, prepar'd as follows, on the inter∣mediate days be also taken.</P>

<P>By the Signs before given, any one that is afflicted with the Head-ach may distinguish and know his Case, and accordingly with the Medicines prescrib'd may have his Cure, they having been long expe∣rienc'd by the Author to be the most effectual in those Cases. The Pills are to be taken three at a time over Night, which will the next Morning give four, five, or six easy Stools: Warm Water-gruel, Broth, Posset-drink or Tea, are Liquors pro∣per to be drank as they operate, and the Patient keeping a little warm the days he takes them will be the better. They may be repeated twice or thrice in a Week, as there is Occasion, as also must be the Emetick Pouder, which is to be taken by those whose Stomachs being foul, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the Cause of the Head-ach; but as the Pills are to be taken at Night, the Pouder is to be taken in a Morning in a Spoonful of Water-gruel, with the same Observation and Care as directed for the pur∣ging Pills.</P>
<P>And on the intermediate days of taking either the Cephalick Pills, or Emetick Pouder, it is necessa∣ry for the Patient to take the Cephalick Elixir, Forty or Fifty Drops at a time, every Night and Morning in a Glass of Wine, Ale, Beer, Tea, Coffee or what other Liquor, pleases best, which together with the Pills or Pouder will have wonderful Effects in altering and regulating those Humours that create the Disorder and Pain in the Head.</P>
<P>A Gentleman about Forty Five Years of Age, was almost from his Minority grievously afflicted with the Head-ach, which unfitted him for all Business; he had taken many Medicines, us'd Bleed∣ing, Cupping, Issues, Blisters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which but little more than palliated, or for a while eas'd his Pains,
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>at length I being sent to, with an Account of his Case, order'd my Cephalick Pills and Elixir above∣mentioned to be given him, which greatly reliev'd him; but he complaining also of his Stomach and want of Appetite, I order'd him likewise my Eme∣tick Pouder just now prescrib'd, to be taken alter∣nately with the Pills, by which he found a sensible mitigation of his Pain, and at length a total cessa∣tion of it, that he was perfectly cured.</P>
<P>A young Lady of One and twenty Years of Age, the only Daughter of a worthy Gentleman, had been afflicted with a violent Pain of the Head from a Child, which she was seldom or never free from, and when it was at the worst would cause Vomi∣ting. Her Parents had tryed almost every body; some ascrib'd the Cause to one thing, others to others; at last some body that had heard of the success of my Medicines for the Head, recommen∣ded them, and my Opinion was accordingly desired. I order'd her my Emetick Pouder and Cephalick Elixir, the last to be taken in an Infusion of Sage, Marjoram, Rosemary, Mint, and <HI>Virginia</HI> Snake Root, made like Tea, which she willingly took, tho' the Snake Root made it very bitter and strong, and by continuing them for above two Months she was perfectly restor'd, and is since married, which her Parents, by means of her Indisposition, ever before dispair'd of. I could give divers other Instances, but as I design brevity in this Treatise must be oblig'd to forbear.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Megrim.</HEAD>
<P>THE Megrim is a vehement Pain in one half of the Head, either on the Right or Left side thereof, afflicting either the <HI>Teguments</HI> without the Scull, or the <HI>Meninges</HI> of the Brain within, agree∣ing in Quality and coming near the Nature of the Old Head-ach, spoken of in the 'foregoing Chapter. If it be without the Scull, the Part pain'd is most commonly so sore that the Patient can hardly bear its being touch'd; if it be within the Scull, that Soreness is wanting, and the Pain is the more vehe∣ment. Sometimes the Pain is more towards the <HI>Occiput</HI> or hinder part of the Head, and sometimes more toward the <HI>Sinciput</HI> or fore part of the Head, or near the Root of the Eye on that side which is, pain'd. If it be accidental, it never afflicts the Pa∣tient but upon extraordinary Occasions; but if it be habitual, it returns either at set periods of Time, or keeps an uncertain irregular Course, being excited without any apparent Cause, continuing long and with that vehemency that the Patient thinks it will distract him.</P>
<P>From these Signs it appears, that as the Megrim is from like Causes of the Head-ach, spoken of in the last Chapter, so the Cure is to be attempted; and tho' many Authors have prescribed many Medi∣cines both for one and the other, yet they allow they are to be remedied, if such a thing be to be done, with the same Medicines, which I also have experienced; and the best to do it, that ever I met with, are what I have recommended in the former Chapter, and which if the Patient keeps to, I mean
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>both Pills, Pouder, and Elixir, the former to be taken as mention'd, alternarely, that is, one time the Pills, the next time the Pouder, and so on, and the Elixir the days on which neither the Pills or Pouder are taken, will undoubtedly free the Patient therefrom, if it be in the Power of Medicine to do it. I have performed the Cure by them in several; and parti∣cularly in a Gentlewoman who about the time her Monthly Visits left her, was so afflicted with the Megrim, sometimes of one side of the Head, at o∣ther times on the other, that she had very little Ease Night or Day; She relating her Case to me, I gave her both my Pills, Pouder, and Elixir, which in five Weeks carryed off her Pain perfectly, so that she was, and is as free from it as ever in her Life, tho' it is many Months since.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP III.</HI> Of the Vertigo, Giddiness or Swimming of the Head.</HEAD>
<P>THE Vertigo, Giddiness or Swimming of the Head, is a Disease in the Cavities of the Brain, causing the Patient to think all things turn round, and many times causes him to stagger and reel, and sometimes to fall down, the Brain and Senses being disturb'd, but often times without any Pain, by a preternatural Exagitation and Commotion, yet depriving not the Patient of either Sense or Motion.</P>
<P>This Disease is twofold, one <HI>Simple,</HI> wherein the Sight remains unhurt, the other <HI>Complex,</HI> where∣in the Sight is darkened, as it were, with a Mist or Cloud, and is call'd <HI>Scotoma.</HI></P>
<P>The Signs by which the Vertigo is known, is, by what has been said, only when the Disease is recent
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>or but gentle, the Patient seldom falls, but staggers as it were, a little, and is confounded in his Mind by a certain kind of Amazement, from the sudden Exagitation of the Animal Spirits, so that if he be walking he knows not where he is, but must be forc'd to stand still to consult the place of his pre∣sent Station, whither he is going and what is the Occasion, because a strange kind of Forgetfulness seizes him, notwithstanding all this while his inter∣nal Senses are not so disturbed, but that he knows he is about Business, tho' the particulars be forgotten, which after a little pause he recollects again, and becomes perfectly well.</P>
<P>Sometimes, as already said, this Affect is accom∣panied with Dimness and Darkness of the Sight, representing variety of Colours, and things to look double and treble, in which Case not only all the other Symptoms are existent, but the Circum∣volution or Rotation of Things seem to be with a great Violence or Vehemency, insomuch that when the Paroxysm seizes the Patient, he will ne∣cessarily fall, unless he catches hold of something to support himself.</P>
<P>This Disease happens chiefly in Winter, and to People that are fasting, and is of very dangerous Consequence if not in time remedied; for it comes from Blood and Humours in the Brain, but chiefly from cold Humours and flatulent Vapours arising from the Stomach or other inferior Parts, causing a continual Pain in the Head, Noise in the Ears, Dul∣ness of the Senses, Loss of Smelling and sometimes of Tasting; and if it comes by consent of the Sto∣mach, then there follows a gnawing Pain of the Stomach, Trembling, and sometimes Vomiting, with a bad Digestion.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
<P>When the Vertigo has been of long standing, it generally terminates in a <HI>Scotoma</HI> and too quickly then changes into pernicious Diseases, as the Falling Sickness and Apoplexy. If it happens to old People it is the more dangerous, because of the Weakness of their Brain, Smallness of their Heat and their abounding much with Flegm. If in any that have this Disease, Things appear to their Eyes bloody and reddish, it foretells Madness; if purple Colour, the Falling Sickness especially such as have the <HI>Sco∣toma,</HI> or dark Vertigo. Sometimes the Cause of a Vertigo has been from a Bladder of Water contain'd in one of the Ventricles of the Brain, cast off from the vitiated Blood thither, and is seldom if ever curable, tho' the Patient at the same time Eats, Drinks, and Digests well. I never knew one cured when it had been so, but have been an Eye Witness to those that have dyed thereof, and one particular Man of Seventy odd Years of Age who was dissected, who, tho' he was troubled with a Vertigo, was otherwise constantly in perfect Health. At first the Fits came upon him but two or three times a Year, afterwards they came once a Month, and as he grew older and older, the Disease grew stronger and stronger, and the Paroxysms more frequent and of longer continuance, till at length he had a Fit once a Week: The last Fit he had, he complain'd that all things turn'd round violently, and altho' he lean'd upon a Table, call'd out vehemently for some body to hold him, for else he should fall by the hasty turning round of Things. He desired to go to Bed forthwith, which he did, and whilst he lay still, he seem'd to be somewhat pacify'd; but upon the least turning of his Head or any part of his Body, he cryed out that the Bed
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>and House would be turned topsy turvy; and all this while he had no Convulsion, Frenzy or Madness, or the least appearance of a Fever, ex∣cept about four or five Hours before his Death. As I said before, when this Man's Head was open'd, there was found a Bladder of Water about the bigness of a Pigeon's Egg, lying in the 'foremost Ventricle of the Brain, which alone was the Cause of his Death. The Cure of a Vertigo, if it be simple, is not very difficult, it being to be done most commonly by Medicines that discuss the flatu∣lent Spirits, which trouble the Ventricles of the Brain, or that still and quiet the too great Ema∣nations of the Animal Spirits, and that comfort and strengthen the Brain that is hurt or weaken'd by the said Flatulency and Irregularities of the Spirits. The first is perform'd by heating Cephalicks in∣wardly and outwardly, which have Power to dis∣cuss any Ventosity lodged in the Cortex of the Brain. The second by Medicines that delight, comfort, refresh, and strengthen the Brain.</P>
<P>Authors innumerate Medicines for both pur∣poses, and those of Amber, Nutmegs, Rosemary, Sage, Oranges, Lemons, Ambergreese, Musk, Pea∣cock's Dung, and the like; but the best thing that ever I knew to be universally successful, is my Ver∣tiginous Spirit following, of which fifty Drops be∣ing taken every Night and Morning, in a Dish of Green Tea, or which is better, in Tea made of Rosemary, Lavender, Carraway Seeds, Sage, Juni∣per Berries, and Sweet Majoram, will have incre∣dible Effect, more especially if a few Drops of the Spirit be Snuff'd up the Nostrils twice or thrice a Day, and the Forehead, Temples, top of the Head, and Nape of the Neck, be bathed with it; by
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>which means the windy Vapours will be dissipated, the Brain comforted, strengthen'd and fortify'd much more than by any other Medicine that I know of whatever; only now and then it may be proper for the Patient, the better to carry off the offending Cause, to take a Dose of the Cephalick purging Pills, prescribed in the first Chapter, or rather if he finds any Disorder of the Stomach, to supply their place with the Emetick Pouder there∣in also prescrib'd.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of Forgetfulness or Dotage.</HEAD>
<P>FOrgetfulness is a Disease proceeding from ma∣lign Vapours, or an over hot, or over cold and moist Temperament of the Brain, which ren∣ders the Animal Spirits either too Volatile, that the Thoughts are not to be contracted, or else too Torpid, diminishing the natural Heat, that the Person is dull, sluggish, has no Memory, and can think of nothing as he should.</P>
<P>The Causes of those malign Vapours, or over hot, or cold and moist Temperament of the Brain, are either Natural or Preternatural: If they proceed
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>from Natural Causes, as sometimes they do, from an ill Conformity of the Head and Brain, or over great Thickness of the same, or from too strait or wide Passages, by which the Spirits are either too much compressed or dilated, they are scarcely to be remedied. But if the Causes be from Polson taken, or too many Narcotick Medicines, or from over Watchings, too much Care, bad Air, Sickness, or the like, they may in time be remedied; but if from Falls or Blows, that the Brain is concussed, and the Animal Spirits dissipated or spent, are incura∣ble; for in Youth they breed Folly, and in People of Years Dotage,</P>
<P>But Dotage does not happen altogether to old People neither, for as it is a Depravation of the Fancy and Rational Faculty, arising from an Irregular Phan∣tasm of the Brain, by a Fault of the Animal Spirits which are clouded, darken'd, made black, thick, and opacous, young People may be liable to it as well as old. The Signs of Dotage in the beginning of the Distemper, are perceived by the Patient's be∣ing much more Talkative than usual, (especially those that are of few Words when they are well) and in those that used to be very Taltative when well, it is perceived by their sitting very mute, taking no Notice of any thing, and as it were thinking intentively on something, tho' when ask'd, can give no Account of what. In the height of Dotage, in a mild temper'd Person, there is Fierce. ness, Ribaldry and Scurrilous Language, the Mo∣tion of the Eyes quick, they being affected by Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of the Brain, Arteries, Veins and Nerves, the Pulse irregular and swift, with a Perturbation in the Hypochondria, the Speech and Actions at the same time being altogether unaccountable, in∣congruous
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>and foolish, the Patient being apt to be busied about Toys and Trifles, if not down-right Folly, which shews the principal Faculties of the Mind are extreamly depraved.</P>
<P>These Diseases are commonly without any Dan∣ger attending as to Life, but if they happen to Children very young, they oftentimes make the Child a Fool; but taken in time are to be cured, and so are they many times in People of Years, but not always, as shewn before. I have known, when they have been taken in time, that a proper Vomit and a Volatile Specifick hath roused up Nature's Force, that the Patient hath recovered, and found his Spirits more Vigete, Lively, and his Memory quicker than at any time before, and that by taking my Emetick Pouder prescrib'd in Chapter First, and my Vertiginous Spirit in Chapter the Third, and that in the Particular Case following.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of a Brisk and Airy Temper, quick Wit and Ingenuity, and of an Excellent Apprehen∣sion, Judgment and Memory, fell first into For∣getfulness and Loss of Memory, and after into a Dotage upon some Trouble of Mind, insomuch, that he would talk very foolishly, ask the same Question over and over, and would sometimes, without any Cause, fall a Laughing, at other times Crying, just like a Child, which shew'd that his Intellectuals were really much deprav'd, insomuch that I greatly questioned whether I could do him any Service; however, upon his Friends earnest desire I would try, I sent him Three Papers of my Emetick Pouder, and a Bottle of my Vertiginous Spirit, with Directions for his taking One of the Papers every other Morning, and Fifty Drops of the Spirit every Morning besides, and also every
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>Day about Four in the Afternoon, and at Night mixt in a Glass of the Tea prepar'd with Rosemary, Lavender, Carraway Seeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mention'd in the last Chapter, and to use the Spirit also outward∣ly, as therein directed; which was accordingly done, and by that time the Three Papers of Pouder (which always vomited him well, I enlarging the Dose a little) were taken, and also the Bottle of Vertiginous Spirit taken and used, he grew bet∣ter, his Memory being sounder and discourses more rational; I therefore order'd he should per∣sist in the same Course, which he did for Three Months together, or more, and grew well, return∣ing to his perfect and sound Mind and Memory, and never had any thing more of it afterwards.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of Frenzy and Madness.</HEAD>
<P>THE Frenzy tho' it be not a perfect Madness, yet as it is caus'd from an Inflammation of the Membranes of the Brain, which hurts the Inter∣nal Senses, as the Imagination, Judgment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be said to be a sort of Madness, and the more as there attends those afflicted a kind of Fury, little and troublesome Sleep, speaking without Sense, pulling, as tho' it were, Straws, or the like from the Bedcloaths, being unruly, angry, raging, and the like, and which if not timely remedied, termi∣nates in down right Madness; but as it is what is curable, there is no Danger, provided proper Ap∣plications be made; and the first thing that is to be done is to Bleed, and after that to give Vomits and Cephalicks, than which nothing can exceed my E∣metick Pouder for Vomiting, and Cephalick Elixir
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>for the other Intentions, both prescribed in Chap∣ter the First, they doing all, as it were, at once, I mean without any other Medicine, if the Pouder be repeated Twice or Thrice in a Week, in a Morning, and the Elixir taken as therein directed. But where there is a perfect Madness and Distra∣ction, other Methods must be taken, as Cupping with Scarifications, large Bleedings, Glysters, Blisters, Hypnoticks, frequent Purging and Vomi∣ting, to do which two last, nothing, I say, can be more prevalent than my Cephalick Pills and Eme∣tick Pouder, given alternately as often as the Pa∣tient's strength can bear them.</P>
<P>I know there are many who pretend to Cure Madness by some particular Methods, others by such and such a peculiar Specifick, but with what Success they know best. One came to me once in behalf of a Friend of her's, a Man that had been distracted for many Years, and had been in Mad∣houses, and other Places for Cure, but to no Pur∣pose. I told the Messenger the best Medicines I knew for Cure, were my Emetick Pouder and Ce∣phalick purging Pills, some of both which I gave her, with Directions to give him One Paper of the Emetick Pouder one Day, and resting the next Day, to give Four of the purging Pills the Day following, and so every other Day the Pouder or Pills, which was done, and the patient was much better; but coming for more, the Messen∣ger told me they were advised to give him the following Drink, as one of the most certain Specificks for Madness m the World. I answer'd I could not tell what Extraordinary Vertues were in it, but they might give it notwithstanding his ta∣king my Pouder and Pills, which they did, and the
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>Man was soon after perfectly restored to his right Mind, but when I heard it, I questioned whether that Medicine or mine had most contributed to his Recovery, which they could not tell, nor indeed I, only as he was amended by my Medicines before he took the Drink, I had Reason to think well of them. However, that the Publick may be the better for knowing it, if there be any thing of what is said in it, I here give the Prescription just as they related it to me.</P>
<P><HI>TAKE Dodder of Time, Polypody of the Oak, of each Two Ounces; all the Myrabolans, of each Three Drams; Seeds of Citrons, half an Ounce; Cloves, Three Crams; black Hellebore, Two Drams; Leaves of Sage, Two Handfuls; Rosmary Flowers, an Handful; Staechas Flowers, half an Handful; cut and bruise them, and boil them in Three Quarts of Spring Water, to two Quarts, strain it, and give a Quarter of a Pint every Day at Four a Clock in the Afternoon, and also at Night.</HI></P>

I say as there are Eight sorts of Madness, this Drink which I have prescrib'd, and was so much commended as a Specifick for Cure, I fear will not have the great Effect said of it, tho' any that please may try it, which was the Reason of my giving the Receipt of it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Lethargy, Caras, or Sleepy Diseases.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lethargy is a Disease known by the Pa∣tients being continually sluggish, and sleepy, scarcely answering if often spoke to, only opening their Eyes and shutting them again, without ta∣king the least notice of any thing that was said to them; and so inclin'd to sleep are they, that if you shake them and rouse them ever so much, they will hardly wake, or at leastwise long, but desire to sleep, and are never satisfy'd without it, or indeed with it; so that the Animal Spirits are, as it were, bound and lock'd up by extraordinary Obstructions, there being attending a gentle Fever, an high Pulse, and Breath weak; the Cause is from too much Flegm, cooling the Brain in its Windings and hindmost Cells, which occasions the profound Sleep, and the putri∣fying Humour being extreamly sharp and fretting occasions the Fever, which is in a manner perpe∣tual; and the slowness of Breath is caused from the Affection of the Nerves of the <HI>Thorax</HI> or Breast.</P>
<P>The Lethargy differs from the <HI>Carus,</HI> because in a <HI>Carus</HI> there is no Fever. It differs from a <HI>Catelepsis,</HI> because in that the Eyes, when the Pati∣ent sleeps are open, and in the Lethargy shut.</P>
<P>All sleepy Diseases, if of long continuance, and those happen in Fat, Gross, and Old People, are generally incurable, and by how much deeper the Sleep is, or the Patient the harder to wake, by so much the more is the Disease dangerous, and that especially if it happens after the going off of an Acute Disease; and if the sleepy Disease be exquisite, and the Strength decays and wastes, it is certainly ne∣ver to be cured. But if it happens to one that
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>is Young, and in the Heat of Summer, and the Animal Functions be not much impair'd, and all the Natural Evacuations be perfect, there may be a Cure; to accomplish which, Evacuations by Bleeding, Blistering and Purging, must be made, the latter not by any thing better than my Cepha∣lick Pills prescrib'd in Chapter the first; and then for a Specifick to repercuss the Humour that of∣fends, and strengthen the Brain, I cannot advise a more prevalent Preparation than my Volatile Essence following; which discharges the Animal Spirits of their Burthen, and quickens them to an immense Degree. The Method to be observed is this: First let the Patient Bleed in the Arm Twelve Ounces, or according as he is in Age and Strength. After that apply a strong large Blister to his Neck, or rather between his Shoulders; then the next Night, or next Morning, which he pleases, let him take Four of the Cephalick Pills, which will gently purge him, and every Night and every Morning, (excepting the Nights and Morn∣ings he takes the Pills) as also about Four in the Afternoon, let him take Sixty Drops of my Vo∣latile Essence in a Dish of Tea, or which is more effectual, in a Dish of the Infusion of Rosemary, Lavender, Carraway Seeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> directed in Chapter the Third, which if followed strictly and the Patient's Nostrils and Temples be rubb'd seve∣ral times a Day with a little of the Volatile Es∣sence, and a few Drops of it snuff'd up his Nose now and then, will undoubtedly, by the Blessing of God, bring him to himself, if he be curable, and prevent the Distemper for the future, if the Medi∣cines be but for a time continued.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Coma, or Ʋnnatural Watchings.</HEAD>
<P>THE Coma is a great Desire and Inclination to Sleep, but with an utter inability to do it, arising from Narcotick Vapours which infest the Brain and induce the drowsy or sleepy Indis∣position, yet at the same time so trouble and dis∣quiet the Mind, that they cannot sleep at all, but wink with their Eyes and often open them, having a doting kind of Discourse, attended with an inor∣dinate Motion of the Hands and Thighs.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
<P>It is caused sometimes by a great weakness of the Faculties of the Body, either from some grie∣vous Disease and violent Pains, or from immode∣rate Evacuations, which have dissipated the Ani∣mal Spirits. Unnatural Watchings, are when the common external sense is wearied beyond due or just measure, arising from the continual uninterrupt∣ed Influx of the Spirits into the Organs, as we find when we have over tired our selves by much Walking, Running or Riding, we cannot sleep, tho' we greatly want and desire it, but tumble, and toss and stretch.</P>
<P>Unnatural Watchings are also occasioned by too much Light, Noise, Cares of the Mind, being too thoughtful or intent upon Matters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which hinder Sleep, also Pains, Coughs, Fluxes, a hot Distemper of the Brain, hot, sharp, and salt Va∣pours, which twitch and disturb the Spirits and <HI>Meninges</HI> of the Brain, making People uneasy and restless; or from difect of such natural Vapours, as procure Rest to the Animal Spirits, which long Abstinence from Food will cause, as also Eating too much, especially Suppers.</P>
<P>When Watchings proceed from a Disease, and become a Coma of long standing, the Cure is very doubtful, especially if they have their Speech hindred, or when they breathe, a murmuring Noise be heard in the Throat, or a thin Humour distils out of the Nostrils, or the Patient not able to swal∣low without difficulty, for in those Cases it is dan∣gerous, or at least they degenerate into a Lethargy or Frenzy,</P>
<P>The Cure of a Coma or unnatural Watch∣ings as they proceed from an Humour or internal Cause, that interrupts the Quietude of the Spirits,
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>is best accomplish'd, especially in the Coma, by my Cephalick purging Pills and Cephalick Elixir, prescribed in Chapter the First; and which if ta∣ken as therein directed, will carry off those of∣fending Humours, that the Patient will have his Natural Rest, without taking Opiates and other Narcotick Medicines, which, as they only palliate the Distemper, and give ease but for a while, do in the end rather injure than relieve.</P>

<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Apoplexy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Apoplexy is a Disease of the Brain, sud∣denly depriving the whole Body of Sense and Motion. <HI>Riolanus</HI> defines it to be an Abolition of Sense and Motion, with Respiration hurt, which at last brings Snorting and Suffocation, by rea∣son of thick Flegm flowing out of the Funnel, and obstructing the <HI>Larynx</HI> or Wind-pipe, which also oftentimes and unexpectedly invades all the Ventri∣cles of the Brain, but especially the Fourth Ventri∣cle, wherein, unless the Matter be discussed in the Spinal Marrow, Death unavoidably follows. <HI>Ferne∣lius</HI> says, that an Apoplexy is a Disease bred by an Obstruction of the <HI>Rete Mirabile,</HI> the Afflux of Ar∣terial blood out of the Heart into the Brain, being thereby intercepted. <HI>Willis</HI> says the Sense of the Word Apoplexy denotes Percussion, and by reason of the stupendious Quality of the Distemper, con∣taining, as it were something supernatural, it is call'd Sideration or Blasting; for those struck there∣with, are, as it were, Planet struck, or struck with an invisible Power, falling suddenly to the Ground, and being depriv'd both of Sense and Motion; and the whole Animal Function ceasing,
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>(save that they breathe) they lye for a long season as if Dead, and sometimes, yea too often, are dead indeed, (many of which I hope to shew might have been, and how others may be preserv'd) but if they revive, they are many times taken with an Universal Palsy, or else with the Palsy of one Side. <HI>Riverius</HI> says it is a most deep Sleep, and a total Privation of Sense and Motion, Breathing excepted, wherein the Patient neither opens his Eyes, answers, or feels, when he is spoken to, or hurt, breathing also with difficulty.</P>
<P>The Apoplexy is either accidental, coming of a sudden, and falling indifferently upon any Man, tho' not at all pre-dispos'd thereto, for which by the way, no Preventative Method can be institu∣ted; or it is habitual, from a constant Disposition in some People, because of which they are at first only exercised with light approaches thereof, or rather Symptoms; afterwards the Paroxysms are evident, but gentle; but at length they become more obvious and grievous, and of which at last they for the most part dye.</P>
<P>The Apoplexy is distinguish'd according to its Degrees, into Gentle, Strong and Strongest: The Gentle, is that wherein the Patient breathes free∣ly, and easily becomes sensible again. The Strong. Apoplexy is that wherein the Patient breathes with very great Difficulty, and, as it were, with Violence, Snorting and Foaming at the Mouth. The Strongest and most Dangerous, is that in which all Sense and Motion immediately cease throughout the whole Body, the Breath also being stop'd. In this there is neither Snorting nor Foaming, but the Patients lye as if perfectly Dead; but if they do not quickly recover, they ought not to be buried
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>before Three Days be over, it having been known that some so seized have in that space of Time re∣viv'd again.</P>
<P>The Signs of an Apoplexy are Swoonings, some∣times falling Suddenly and sometimes by Degrees, Sense, Motion, and Voice, being many times ta∣ken away, sometimes only diminish'd, Respiration alone, and that with much difficulty, remaining. Some Persons Sleep deeply, and, as it were, Snort or Snore; the loosen'd Limbs being lift up, fall down with their own weight, in the manner of dead Persons, and their Eyes are either wide open or quite shut, the Pulse at the same time being strong and full, which has deceived many in the Prognosticks of this Disease; in many there is a Relaxation of the Sphincter Muscles of the <HI>Anus</HI> and Bladder, so that the Excrements and Urine come away invo∣luntarily and insensibly.</P>
<P>An Apoplexy very seldom gives any Warning of its approach, unless in Persons subject to Lethar∣gies or Vertigoes, which in many are Fore-runners of this Disease, as also, in some, are Dimness of Sight, Trembling of the whole Body, Incubus or Night-mare often afflicting, gnashing of the Teeth in sleep, and an unusal Heaviness of the Body. It has likewise by many been observed, that smoak∣ing much Tobacco, has caused in some Constitu∣tions, the Apoplexy, and they give Instances of such being seized while they have been smoaking, and dyed; and this they ascribe to its Narcotick Quality, and say by that means it is Injurious to the Brain, and consequently disposes to Apoplexies: But I am of another Opinion as to the thing in ge∣neral; for if Tobacco had such a pernicious Quali∣ty, the many Years it has been in Vogue, and the
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>Multitudes of People of all sorts that have taken it, would have discovered it in an eminent Degree, and have oblig'd the World to leave smoaking it long ago as deleterious. But on the contrary, very ma∣ny People live to a great Age, and in as good a State of Health, tho' they have long and immode∣rately used it, as those that take it not. It must in∣deed be allowed that it is not agreeable to all Con∣stitutions, but the same may be said of almost every thing else, whether Food or Physick; and tho' we have had Instances of some dying of Apoplexies that have taken Tobacco, yet it does not follow, that Tobacco was the Cause. And I presume no wise Man will conclude from a few Instances of the dis∣agreeableness of any one thing to some Men, when vast Numbers of them on the contrary side may be brought to warrant its Use, that it ought univer∣sally to be avoided, or branded with a note of In∣famy. My Sense of Tobacco is, That in those Per∣sons with whom it is found to agree, 'tis a very good Drainer of Humours, and so may supply the place of Issues, or at least that fewer of them may be necessary to those who abound with Moi∣sture; for by its irritating, and occasionally enlarging (from the great Afflux of the <HI>Saliva</HI>) the Secretory Ducts of the Glandules about the Mouth, as 'tis e∣vident there must be a great Discharge, so a great Diversion is made from the Brain (tho' I allow the greatest part of the Matter comes not immediately from thence, but out of the Blood) whence 'tis ad∣viseable that the Persons who take it, should drink but moderately, least otherwise they do themselves more Hurt by the Supply, than they can receive Be∣nefit by the Discharge. But there is another reason why Tobacco may be useful to those who are dispos'd or subject to Apoplexies, I mean to those to whom
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>it is agreeable) and that is by the Vellication the Smoke of it impresses on the Nerves of the Mouth, which it makes to contract, so that by consent of Parts the whole Brain is analogously affected, where∣by if the Brain happens to be more lax than ordi∣nary, and is dispos'd to receive a Flux of Blood or Serum, as it will be after a Person has had and e∣scaped one Fit, it will prove a very useful Admi∣nistration towards restoring the Tone of it, and thereby preventing the Admission of Heterogenous Particles into the Tubes of the Nerves, which cause the Symptoms.</P>
<P>And since I have spoken about Tobacco, I will add a Word or Two concerning Snuff, which, as it causes not, through its frequent Use, any Sternu∣tation or sneezing, to those who take it constantly, is very prejudicial; and where immoderately taken, by some Persons of some Constitutions, so relaxes the Tone of the Brain, as to dispose to Apoplexies, and that because the Matter of it is gross, and apt to lye long about the Extremities of the Olfactory Nerves, so as continually to affect them, especially where they are ever and anon supply'd with more, which keeps the Pores of those Nerves continually open. It is the Opinion of a very great Physician, That Snuff, as now a days used, renders those Per∣sons that take it, liable not only to Apoplexies, but also to the Danger of receiving the Pestilence, if any such Distemper should reign, (which God for∣bid) and that much sooner than others, since from the Symptoms, the Pestilence appears to seize the Brain particularly; and the sudden Fate upon Re∣cord of those that without any preceding Indispo∣fition have, whilst the last Sickness raged, fallen down in the Streets, was doubtless from the Pesti∣lential Miasms, being easily and at once admitted
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>into the Brain by the Olfactory or Smelling Nerves, render'd more open and lax by the profuse taking of Snuff in those Days; those People that used it most, being the soonest and in the most fatal manner, seized with that Disease. It may here be urged, that many, who then used it, received no apparent Injury, or do those that take it now a-days find any harm by it: Be it so, I think the Objection may as well be urged in favour of immoderate Drinking, many who long indulg'd themselves in that practice, having yet liv'd to a great Age, when however it is evident that many more have much shortened their Lives by it. But tho' Pestilencies, (from which Thanks be to God we are at present free) or Apoplexies may not be occasion'd by the profuse taking of Snuff, yet the Vertigo and other Distempers which we find debilitate or hurt the Brain, may reasonably be suppos'd from that pra∣ctice principally to arise.</P>
<P>The Causes of the Apoplexy we have accounted for, and also the Signs: I shall now speak of its Seat, and then of its Prevention and Cure. The Seat of an Apoplexy is without doubt in the more inward recess of the Brain, to wit, the <HI>Corpus Cal∣losum,</HI> and the proximate and immediate Subject of the Disease, is the Animal Spirits inhabiting therein, for that the Understanding, Imagination and com∣mon Sense are so deeply affected as to be perfectly darken'd, and to suffer a total eclipse; but the im∣mediate Subject of this Disaffection is thought to be the middle part of the Brain; because from, thence the Instincts of all Spontaneous Motions proceed, and in this the Perception of all sensible things are terminated.</P>
<P>From Histories and Anatomical Observations of Persons dying of an Apoplexy, Blood has been
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>found extravasated, or out of its proper Vessels, here and there hi great Clots, compressing the Substance of the Brain. In others the <HI>Serous Colluvies</HI> have overflow'd the whole Head. In others a large Bladder of Water has been found in one of the Ventricles, compressing the smaller Passages; from which Observations it may be concluded, that the principal places sorely affected are not the greater Ventricles, but the middle marrowy Substance of the Brain and Cerebel, which is every where Porus and endued with very many minute Passages, that both the Vital Spirits may flow in thi∣ther from the Blood, and the Animal Spirits may flow forth.</P>
<P>The Cure of the Apoplexy is twofold, in the Fit, or out of the Fit; the Cure out of the Fit, is properly speaking preventative, of which I shall treat after I have shewn what is to be done in the Fit.</P>
<P>The Patient being in a Fit, whether it proceeds from the Blood let out of the Vessels, or a Serous or watery Humour, or the breaking of an Imposthume in the Brain, or other invisible Cause, the Cure must not be the less neglected; therefore immediately set the Patient as upright as may be, for some Hours, (for the Disease being a sleepy one, if the Patient should be put to Bed it might incline more to sleep, which is expresly against the Intention of Cure) and let him Blood plen∣tifully, for nothing is more capable of sooner relieving, and this Distemper of all others, requires the most sud∣den Remedy, for the Disention both of the San∣guiferous Vessels, and Habit of the Parts, being thro' Bleeding remov'd, the Fibres which constitute both, must be presumed to contract themselves by their Tonick Motion, but especially those in the Habit. Afterwards, or while this is doing, some proper Ster∣nutatory must be blown up the Nostrils with a Quil, the best of which I ever knew instantly to bring the
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>Patient to himself being my following Apoplectick Species, the Virtues of which in one particular Case I will here give you.</P>
<P>A Gentleman being seized with an Apoplectick Fit, several Physicians and Surgeons were call'd by the By-standers, they all immediately endeavoured to let him Blood, but he would not Bleed, at length some one by, who knew I had Medicines for Fits and Distempers of the Head, came for me, and told me the Man was dead; if so, I said, I could not setch him to Life; but, it being the common saying when there is danger, that the Patient is either dead or; dying, in hopes the Messenger might be mistaken, away I went, taking with me a little of my Apople∣ctick Species. When I got thither I beheld the mi∣serable Object as one dead indeed, he lying so very stupified, as that no Life could be perceived to be in him, and as a dead Man I look'd upon him. Bleed I found he would not, nor could any thing be got down his Throat, therefore I instantly blew a little of my Species forcibly up his Nostrils, by which means he a little while after began to stir, I then blew up a little more, upon which a large Evacuation of Pus, Water, and Viscous Matter mix'd with Blood, was immediately made, whereupon he a little revived, and being almost come to himself, a very great Flux of Blood (near upon a Quart) presently followed thro' his Nostrils, so that in about an Hours time or a little more, after the use of the Species, he perfectly recovered from his Fit, his Understanding, Speech and Senses being all restor'd. This Danger being over, the next thing to be considered for him was how to prevent any more Fits for the future; therefore I order'd him my Cephalick Pills and Cephalick Elixir prescrib'd in Chapter the First, to be taken as there directed, which had the desir'd effect.</P>

</DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P>In a Fit of the Apoplexy, besides Bleeding and using my Apoplectick Species above prescrib'd, the Mouth of the Patient must, if possible, be opened and kept so, and something given to drink, if it be no more than about Twenty Drops of Spirit of <HI>Sal Armoniack</HI> or Hartshorn, in a Glass of fair Water, also the Arms, Hands, Thighs, Legs and Feet, are to be chafed or rubbed with Oil of Amber, or the like; also a Glister is to be given him forthwith, if it be possible to be done, likewise Cuppings, with Scarifi∣cations, Blisters and Issues, which latter take up so much more time to relieve, than there is to be had in such dangerous Cases, the only present Help in the Exigency, is Bleeding, and the Use of my Apo∣plectick Species, with Anointing, unless any thing
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>can be gotten down the Throat as just now men∣tioned.</P>
<P>As the Recovering a Patient out of a Fit of the Apoplexy, when there is so much Danger, and Life is so imminently threaten'd, is a very happy thing, so to prevent the Fits for the future, or secure those from them, that have the Symptoms of them, is not a much less good Service; for we have seen and known many that have had one Fit after another, and each Fit more dangerous, till at length Life hath been carried away indeed, therefore tho' it be difficult to prevent the Fits, yet I persuade my self, if the Patient follow the Rules I shall lay down, he will not only be secured from more, while he is taking the Medicines, but will find the very Cause of the Disease taken a∣way so effectually, that upon his desisting to take them he will hear no more of his Malady.</P>
<P>Therefore let such that are subject to the Apoplexy, or in fear of that Disease, take Three of my Gepha∣lick Pills every fourth or fifth Morning, which will gently purge him, calling away Humours from the Blood which infest the Brain; and those Mornings he does not take the Pills, he is to take Ffty Drops of my Cephalick Elixir in a Glass of fair Water, or mix'd with a little Wine, if the Water be too raw for his Stomach; as also the same Dose every Night going to Bed; which Elixir is a Specifick Midicine, corroborating the Head, Brain and Spirits, and keep∣ing the Blood in due order. And if he finds any disposi∣tion to a Fit, by any of the Signs or Symptoms, men∣tioned to attend Apoplexies, he should once a Week snuff up into each Nostril the quantity of a very small white Pea of my Apoplectick Species afore-mentioned, at Night an Hour or two before he goes to Bed which will purge the Head and Brain, and discharge from the Nostrils and Mouth a large quantity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>Viscous Humour, that in those Cases infest the Brain, whereby the Patient will be much more lightsome and easy, as by so much the Brain has been clear'd of the Humour offending it. Thus will no People, in my Opinion, be troubled with Apoplexies, as we frequently see they are; I taking the Medicines I have recommended to be such for those Purposes, as are not to be excell'd; and hope those that use them will have cause to say their Effect have not fallen short of my Account of them.</P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Palsy and other Nervous Diseases.</HEAD>
<P>THE Palsy is a Resolution or Relaxation of the Nerves from their due Habit, by which means Motion and Sense, sometimes one only, sometimes both together, in the whole Body, or in some Part or Parts thereof, cannot be used or exercised after their due manner.</P>
<P>It is a Disease either perfect, in which Sense and Motion are quite lost and gone, or imperfect, where∣in Sense or Motion are only decay'd or diminish'd, so as to occasion a Trembling or Shaking of the Parts affected, and in this latter, if the Diminution be but small, it cannot be properly call'd a Palsy, but a <HI>Stupor</HI> or a Numbness, which however is commonly the Fore-runner of a true Palsy.</P>
<P>A Palsy may be either from the hurt of the Mo∣tive Faculty, the Sense remaining sound, or from the hurt of the Sensitive, the Motive remaining well. The Cause may be either from a Solution of Unity in the Nerves, as by a Bruise from a Fall or Blow, or by a Wound, or from a Relaxation of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Back, suddenly caused, or it may come from innate Causes, or cold pituitous Humours, which relax and
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>dissolve the Tone of the Nerves, or from straitness or narrowness of the Nerves caused by Obstructions, or by Constipation from some Tumour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or from thin, sharp, serous and windy Humours moved in the Bowels, not only to the beginning of the Orifices of the Nerves, but to the very Muscles and Tendons; or it may proceed from Causes external and foreign, as from Narcoticks, or Poisons, immeasurably drink∣ing strong Liquors, the taking of Henbane, Opium, Quicksilver, Antimony, Arsnick, or the like. To the external Causes may also be added the excess of Heat or Cold; by the first of which the Spirits are wasted and spent, and by the latter they are obstructed in their Passages by Congelation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or it comes by Consent of Parts, and that for the most Part in Scor∣butick Habits of Body, but the general Causes of a Palsy, are all those which hinder the Passages of the Animal Spirits into the Nerves and Muscles, and in whatever part they are interrupted from flowing, there will be a Palsy in that Part, it being impossible for the Nerves to act or perform their Function as they ought, without being sufficiently fill'd and in∣vigorated by the Spirits.</P>
<P>In whatever place, I say, this Hindrance happens, whether about the Spinal Marrow, or about the Con∣jugations or Branches of the Nerves proceeding there∣from, it causes a Palsy either of more or fewer Parts, according as the Nerves affected are more general or particular.</P>
<P>If the Nerves that take their rise near the Brain, or in the beginning of their Passage from the Brain, or the spinal Marrow lying just under the Brain, be hurt or affected, there is commonly a ge∣neral Palsy, wherein also Breathing, the Voice, Speech, and Swallowing with some excressive Motions do suffer hurt. But if the Hurt is in the following Pro∣duction
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>of this Marrow, it makes those Members only paralytick, into which its Branches or Nerves are inserted: But the Palsy is so much the more general by how much the effect of the said spinal Marrow is near to the Brain, or Original of the Nerves.</P>
<P>If the Eye be affected with the Palsy, the visive Nerves are originally hurt, as also the <HI>Cerebrum</HI> it self. If the Tongue is Paralytick, the Conjugation of Nerves serving the Tongue is hurt, and the Speech is also defective, and by reason of its Community with the Auditory Nerve, if the defect be so great as to cause a Total loss of Speech, the Patient is for the most part Deaf also. If there be a Palsy of the Larynx, Jaws, Midriff, as also of the Bladder and Fundament, the Nerves of the sixth and seventh Conjugations, are hurt about their Original. If there be a defect of the Voice, the Recurrent Nerve is affected. If there be a defect in Swallowing, the Nerves that go to the Muscles of the Jaws are hurt; if there be danger of Suffocation, the Nerves that go to the Midriff are hurt, tho' the Midriff (the Instru∣ment of Breathing) can otherwise, in some sort, per∣form its Office, for that it receives Nerves also from the Spinal Marrow.</P>
<P>If the Sphincter Muscles of the Bladder and Anus be paralytick, there follows an involuntary voiding of Urine and the Excrements, the Conju∣gations of Nerves supplying those Parts, being gene∣rally affected or hurt.</P>
<P>If the Palsy is in the Legs, the Nerves affected are about the bottom of the Spinal Marrow, and the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the <HI>Os Sacrum.</HI> And thus we must search out for the place whence the Nerves spring, which are dispersed to those Parts affected with the Palsy, and that being known, the Cure is the easier accom∣plished. From these things it is apparent what Con∣jugation
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>of Nerves are most affected, when the Palsy is in this or that Part only; but when there is an universal Palsy, there is, for the most part, an Af∣fection of the whole <HI>Genus Nervosum</HI> or Nervous System, which comes to pass from one or more of the Causes already mentioned.</P>
<P>The Signs of the Palsy are manifest, to wit, De∣privation of Sense and Motion of the Parts; the Eye, if that be affected, is weakned and depraved on that side where the Part is affected for want of Nourish∣ment; the Speech is much alter'd; the Urine is most times white and thin by means of Obstructions. If it comes from a Blow, Fall, Wound, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or upon an Apoplexy, Lethargy, Carus, or other Effects of the Brain or <HI>Genus Nervosum,</HI> it will not quickly be cured; no more will the Palsy in young People pro∣ceeding from a cold and moist matter, because of the dissimilitude of the Disease to the Nature of such Pa∣tients. The Palsy in old People is never perfectly cured, because they want Natural Heat; and an in∣veterate Palsy is most commonly incurable.</P>
<P>The Cure of the Palsy therefore is uncertain, ac∣cording as is the Cause and Strength of the Disease, and Constitution of the Patient; nor is it in any cured but by first and chiefly altering the whole habit of the Body, rectifying the discracy of the Blood, and removing the Morbifick Matter offending, and that at last by strengthening the Parts hurt, that they may for the future be able to resist all other Assaults of the Disease.</P>
<P>To do this, Medicines must be both inwardly ta∣ken and outwardly apply'd. Authors have not been sparing in their Prescriptions for that purpose, there being numbers of them to be met with; but it is to be doubted many of them would be found to be of very little, if any, effect; I have known many of
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>the (reputed) celebrated ones made use of, but the Benefit was not equivalent to the Trouble, nor in∣deed can I say any one of the many I have met with, have come near answering their Characters, tho' I my self have used them with the strictest Care and Observation, which put me upon considering how to find out those that might be effectual, and which I have accomplish'd so far, as to cure in many Cases of that kind, I might say most; and even in invete∣rate Palsies, by a constant Application of those Me∣dicines, I know not what effects may be produced, it may be more than I am willing to say, or the Pa∣tient expect.</P>
<P>The Medicines I speak of are only Two, one is my Paralytick Elixir for inward use, which is this:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>The Paralytick Elixir.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE Pellitory of <HI>Spain,</HI> long Pepper, and Gin∣ger, of each an Ounce; Scorzonera, Cloves, Mace, and Cinnamon, of each Six Drams; Zedoary, Ga∣langal, Nutmegs, Wood of Aloes and Juniper Berries, of each Ten Drams; black Pepper, Cardamoms, Dittany, Coriander Seeds, Alkermes Berries, Cubebs and Bay-Ber∣ries, of each one Ounce; Orange Peel and Citron Peel, of each Six Drams; Spicknard, Sage, Rosemary, La∣vender, Chamomile Flowers, and Penny-Royal, of each an Ounce; Salt of Tartar, half an Ounce; out, slice, and bruise the Ingredients as they require, and put them into a Digesting Glass, and pour upon them a Pint and half of compound Radish Water doubly distill'd; let them digest close stopt that nothing may evaporate, for Forty Eight Hours in a Sand Heat; and when cold, strain off the Liquor, pressing the Ingredients strongly in a Press; then, put the Ingredients into the Digesting Glass again, and pour upon them another Pint and half of compound Radish Water, digesting and pressing out the Liquor as
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>before; mix the Two Liquors together in a fresh Dige∣sting Glass, to which put of the finest Succotrina Aloes, an Ounce; Salt of Amber, an Ounce and half; Volatile Salts of Hartshorn and Armoniack, of each half an Ounce; Camphir, an Ounce; digest them close stop'd, in a Sand Heat, for Forty Eight Hours, or so long as till it be E∣lixirated, which will be when the Aloes, Salts, and Cam∣phir, are perfectly dissolved and united with the Liquor. <HI>The Dose is fifty or sixty Drops.</HI></P>

First will come off a Spirit, than a Yellow Oil, and at last a Black Oil, which mix altogether, and add to them Four Ounces of Camphir, and digest them close stopt, so long as till they are all united, and it is done.</P>
</DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P><HI>The abovesaid Elixir is to be taken in Drops, Fifty or Sixty at a time, every Night and Morning, in a Glass of the following Drink, which will keep the Body soluble.

<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>The Drink to take the Elixir in, is this:</HEAD>
<P><HI>TAKE new Ale from the Tun, Four Gallons; White Wine, one Gallon; Juice of Scurvy Grass, Three Pints; Juices of Tarragon, Water-Cresses and Brooklime, of each one Pint; Shavings of Horse-radish Roots, Mustard seed bruised, of each Four Ounces and an half; put the Ingredients into a Bag, which put into the Ale and Juices, first mix'd together, let them work up all together; and when the Fermentation is over, and the Drink settled, which will be in about Five or Six Days, Bottle it off, putting a Clove slit into each Bottle, and also an Ounce of White Sugar.</HI></P>

<P>In half a Pint of this Drink the Drops are to be taken, and the Drink may be drank by it self at Table, or any other time, if the Patient pleases. But where the Case is slight, or the Patient cares not for the trouble of preparing this Drink, the Paralytick Elixir may be taken in a Glass of Wine and Water, or any other convenient agreeable Liquor.</P>
<P>By the Volatile and Operative Quality of the Drink and Elixir, a speedy flowing of the Spirits will be let into the <HI>Genus Nervosum,</HI> for they not only al∣ter the Blood and Juices of the whole Body, but also remove the offending Cause, circulate the Spirits, and give Strength, and that as well in all manner of Di∣seases of the Nerves, as in the Palsy, and with that good effect, that 'tis believed no Medicines can do more.</P>
<P>A certain Gentleman by a Fall from his own Coach hurt his Back, that he could not stand upright, at length it brought on a Palsy, some part of the Nerves of the Seventh <HI>Vertebrae</HI> being hurt in their Original; to cure him many things were ap∣ply'd,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Epilepsy or Falling-Sickness, also Convulsions and Cramp.</HEAD>
<P>THE Epilepsy or Falling-Sickness, is a Con∣vulsive Motion of the whole Body, coming by Fits, depriving the Sick suddenly both of Reason and Sense, wherein the whole Body is contracted. <HI>Galen</HI> calls the Falling-Sickness always a Convulsion, but improperly, for it is not a true Convulsion, but a Convulsive Motion of the whole Body, wherein all the External and Internal Senses are abolish'd.</P>
<P>It is call'd the Falling-Sickness, because many times the Persons afflicted, fall down when their Fits come upon them; it is also call'd <HI>Morbus Sacer,</HI> either because it doth contaminate, as it were, the Sacred Soul or Life, or because it is seated in the Head, the Sacred Temple of the Soul, as Philoso∣phers say, or else call'd so from the Greatness of the Disease, or rather because it is a Disease not often cured (if it be inveterate) by Humane Help, but by Divine Aid. It is also by Authors call'd <HI>Morbus Herculeus,</HI> and that either because <HI>Hercules,</HI> as the Poets feign, was taken with this Distemper, or be∣cause it is hard, like his Labours, and difficult to cure. Others call it <HI>Morbus Puerilis,</HI> because Chil∣dren when they begin to have Teeth, are often seized with this Disease, also <HI>Morbus Comitialis,</HI> be∣cause it takes Men on a sudden when they are in
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>Company; also <HI>Morbus Lunaticus,</HI> because People are generally seized with it, at certain times of the Moon, as the New and Full; likewise <HI>Morbus Sonticus,</HI> because it is a Distemper that much afflicts and hurts the Person who has it.</P>
<P>When the Fit comes, the Patient falls down, is plucked up together, trembles, turns about, snorts, crys out, and foams at the Mouth, and makes a kind of roaring or howling Noise, clashing or gra∣ting and closing his Teeth, fast shutting and holding together his Fingers, voiding his Urine and Excre∣ments insensibly, and foaming at Mouth froth, like the White of an Egg work'd with a Wisk.</P>
<P>It is caused of gross Flegm, or sharp Choler, ob∣structing the Passage of the Spirits in the Ventricles of the Brain, which within pulls or twinges the prin∣cipal Nerves, and thereby causes a straitning of the Passage, by which there follows a drawing back and shutting up of the Animal Spirits which cause Sense; from defect of which there follows immedi∣ately all the Symptoms of this Disease, and by which the Parts suffer a Convulsive Motion.</P>
<P>Tho' what has been said to be the Cause, yet there are many afflicted with this Disease Heredita∣rily, from the same Diseasy Principle in their Parents, so that they bring it into the World with them; but upon general Observation it is a Disease chiefly oc∣casioned by some Posterous Accident.</P>
<P>There are differences of this Disease according to its Cause, and the Constitution it seizes on. One is recent, or but newly begun, the other inveterate and of long standing. There is also another more mild, in which some certain Parts suffer only a Convulsion; or else more grievous, wherein there is a Convulsion of the whole Body. Another is periodical, coming once or twice a Year or once or twice a Month, at New
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>or full Moon, or oftner, but always keeping its certain times, tho' others again I have known to be surpriz'd with the Fits unawares.</P>
<P>It is a Disease to some, from an Epileptick Dispo∣sition in the Brain, to others from a preceding Cause in the inferior Parts, to others from Distempers of the Stomach, to others from Worms, to others from the Womb, and to others from hurts of the exter∣nal Parts; it never seizes some till they are grown up in Years, and others never but in their Infancy; but tho' it most commonly happens to Children, yet it sometimes afflicts grown Persons, and it is remark'd by <HI>Galen</HI> to be a Disease incurable if it takes them after the Age of Twenty five Years.</P>
<P>The Cure of this Disease is twofold, when the Di∣sease is upon them, and when the Fit is over.</P>
<P>When the Fit is upon them, Authors advise to give a few Drops of Spirit of Hartshorn, Castor, or the like, in a Glass of fair Water, and to smell to the same, rubbing the Nostrils a little with it, or with Oil of Amber. And when the Fit is over, to pre∣vent it for the future, they order Blisters, Glisters, Purges, Vomits, Cuppings, and the like, and give Specificks inwardly, which they prescribe, but they are so numerous that it is inconsistent with the bre∣vity I design in this Treatise, to note them, as 'tis judg'd they would, many of them at least, be as in∣significant if I did.</P>
<P>I have attended many Patients in my time both in and out of the Fits, and tho' I have used many things recommended, I could not find any thing come near my Epileptick Spirit following, both to recover Pa∣tients when in Fits, and to rectify the Indisposition of the Parts in order to prevent them for the future. But the Method I use when I see any one in a Fit, is this, I immediately blow a little of my Apoplectick
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>Species, prescrib'd in Chapter the 8th, up each Nostril, and give inwardly a few Drops of the Epileptick Spi∣rit, as Thirty to a grown Person, and Five or Six to Children, in a Glass of fair Water, rubbing the No∣strils, Temples, top of the Head and Nape of the Neck with a little of the Spirit also, which almost In∣stantly, as soon as the Species begin to operate, brings the Patient out of the Fit. After that is done, to pre∣vent the Fits for the future, I first purge the Patient with my Cephalick Pills prescrib'd in the 1st Chapter, giving them, as there directed, according to Age or Strength, every third or fourth Day; and in the in∣termediate days, I give Thirty, Forty or Fifty Drops of my Epileptick Spirit, every Night and Morning in a Glass of fair Water, which is the best Vehicle; and order the top of the Head, Nape of the Neck, Tem∣ples and Back-bone, to be rubb'd with my <HI>Nerve Fo∣tus,</HI> prescrib'd in the 9th Chapter, every Night and Morning, which wonderfully corrects and alters the Humours of the Body, and strengthens the whole Man, especially if the course be continued for some time after the time the Fits usually return, and I be∣lieve scarce One Patient in Twenty, where the Disease is not Hereditary, will by this Method ever fail of being cured.</P>

<P>The like good Service will these Medicines I have now mentioned do in Convulsions, which is a Di∣sease from a forced Contraction of the Nerves and Muscles towards their Original, which is the Brain and Spinal Marrow, wherein the voluntary Motion of the Joints is hurt, the natural form and situation is deprav'd or changed, and the Parts affected are annoyed with a most sharp Pain.</P>
<P>There are Four kinds of Convulsions, one when the whole Body is bended or drawn forward, another when the whole Body is convulsed and drawn back∣ward, another when the Convulsion is equally both ways, so that the whole Body is stiff like a Stake, that it cannot be moved any way, and the other is when it happens to a particular Part, as the Hands, Arms, Legs, Thighs, Hips, and sometimes remarka∣ble when it happens to the Bowels, Stomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When it happens to the Hands, Arms, Legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is what is call'd the Cramp.</P>
<P>The Brain is oftentimes affected in this Disease, and sometimes the Marrow of the Back or <HI>Spina Medullae,</HI> as also the Nerves and Muscles as said before.
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>The Signs are manifest, and the Causes many, as from Wounds, loss of much Blood, cold Humours, Flegm, the taking of Hellebore, Drunkenness, Sur∣feiting, pricking a Nerve or Tendon, Worms, biting of venemous Beasts, or the like. But be the Cause from what it will, I could never find the Cure bet∣ter or sooner accomplish'd than by the Method and Medicines a little before mentioned and prescribed, which if followed as directed for the Falling-Sickness, answers the Intention so much, as I may presume to say nothing can do more. And one thing I can't but note before I leave this Chapter, which is, that for the Cramp of the Legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which many People are often troubled with, there is not a better Medicine upon Earth to bathe with, than my <HI>Nerve Fotus,</HI> mentioned in the 9th Chapter, as they that use it will say.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the Incubus or Night-Mare.</HEAD>
<P>THE Night-mare, or, as some call it, the Hag, is a Nocturnal Disease arising from thick Va∣pours which chiefly obstruct the hinder part of the Brain, by which the Flux of Animal Spirits being stop'd, Breathing is hindred, the Voice intercepted, and the Body so oppress'd (as it were between sleep∣ing and waking) with a weight lying upon the Breast and holding fast the Man, that, notwithstanding all his Endeavours, the whole Faculty of moving seems for a season to be abolished.</P>
<P>I say, in the time of the Fit, the Patient endea∣vours and strives with vehemency to stir, move, and shake off his Burden, but in vain; for when the Fit is off, and he comes to himself, he find's he is not moved an Hair's breadth, but lyes in the same Place and Posture, tho' he thought he struggled strongly with what oppress'd him, and that he cry'd out, when indeed
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>he never spoke one Word; but because of the great Oppression about the Heart and Midriff, and fear of Suffocation, he commonly groans, and thereby ex∣presses the Weight of his Affliction with Fear and Terror. And tho' this Disease so strongly seizes the universal Man in the Fit, as to abolish all manner of external Motion, yet it hurts the Understanding and internal Senses but little, nor indeed the common Sense of Feeling, because if any one, being by, does but touch or pull the Patient, tho he be in the heighth of the Fit, he will immediately come to him∣self, and perfectly remember and tell all the Circum∣stances of the Affliction.</P>
<P>As from the great oppression the Patient groans, so also are the inward Senses of many so disturb'd, as that they believe it was a Spirit that held them, or that they were hag-ridden (whence comes the Name) or that some Witch or Devil, sometimes in one Shape, sometimes in another, as of a Dog, a Cat, Bear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> lyes upon and oppresses them, and will possitively tell you, and themselves verily believe it, that they struck the Devil or Witch, when at the same time they never stirr'd their Hands or Arms, as aforesaid, an Hair's breadth from the Place.</P>
<P>This Disease happens to those who sleep on their Back, and rarely to those who sleep on their Sides Those who have this Disease much and often, are in danger of falling into the Apoplexy, Vertigo, Madness Palsy, or Epilepsy; many Children dye of this Di¦sease in the Night, by reason of abundance of thick Vapours arising from the Milk they suck, by which means many Nurses have been hardly and unjustly censured for Over-laying their Nurseries, when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Truth they have dyed of this Disease. Those tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> use a Temperate Dyet, are seldom molested with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Night-Mare, but it chiefly happens to such as ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>loaded with Crudities, and are Intemperate; as also to Corpulent People, and Children, and others who eat too much, especially at Night, and have bad Digestions.</P>
<P>The Indications of the Cure of this Distemper are threefold: First the Humour or Matter that interrupts the Flux of the Animal Spirits is to be removed, which is done by proper evacuating Medicines. Secondly, the discrasy of the Blood is to be rectified and re∣duced to its prestine state of Health, which is done by Specifick and Alterative Medicines. Thirdly, the Parts affected and weaken'd by the Force of the Morbifick Matter, are to be strengthen'd; to do which, the same Order and Method, and the same Medica∣ments that I have recommended in the last Chapter, for the Cure of the Falling Sickness, are most proper, tho' truly, Medicines less in Power and Virtue than they are endued with, might in this Disease serve the turn; tho' I cannot but say as they are the most powerful, so they are more certain and speedy in their Operation, and less of them than others will suffice to compleat the Cure. I do therefore for those Reasons recommend them, and assure the Patient that he will not be mistaken in his Expectations of a Cure by their Use,</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of a Catarrh or Defluxion of Rheum, hurting the Sight, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, Swallowing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Catarrh or Defluxion, or as some call it, a Di∣stillation, is a flowing of some Excrementitious Humours from the Brain to the lower Parts, as to the Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Palate, Throat, Lungs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that the Brain is chiefly affected, the concoctive Faculty of it being hurt, or the expulsive Faculty irritated and stirred up, from an abundant Repletion
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>of Flegmatick Rheum, either generated in the Brain from the hurt of the concoctive Faculty, or through the fault of the Brain it self.</P>
<P>There are many kinds of those Rheums, some more thick, others more thin, some acrid and salt, others more sweet, some flow more violently, others more slowly. If it be hot, 'tis sharp and thin, flowing by the Nose and Mouth, the Forehead and Face are hot, and the Nose many times swells. If it be cold, there is a Pain and Dulness of the Head; the Humour that floweth down is not sharp or pricking, but the Patient is drowsy, his Eyes dazle, his Hear∣ing thick, his Nostrils stop'd, all his Senses dull, his Eyes and his whole Body heavy and lumpish, and each of these is more or less, as the Humour falleth more or less upon that Part: If the Rheum falls upon the Eyes, they look red, swell'd and sore, da∣maging the Sight if not soon cured; if upon the Nose, there is Stoppage of the Nostrils, loss of Smell∣ing, and the Nostrils are sore, by the sharpness of the Humour, and violent Sneezings follow; if it falls upon the Ears, it causes Pain in them, Deafness, and oftentimes Imposthumes; if it descends upon the Pa∣late, it causes Inflammation of it, Relaxation of the <HI>Ʋvula</HI> (which old Women call the falling down of the Palate) Swelling and Soreness, also hurt of the Taste; if the Rheum falls upon the Throat, it causes Inflammation and Swelling of the Glandules (vulgarly call'd the Almonds of the Ears, and deem'd their falling down) and hinders Swallowing, so that no∣thing can be got down but with very great diffi∣culty; if the Rheum rushes down upon the Lungs, it causes, if it be sharp and violent, a dangerous Suf∣focation, or at least an Obstruction of the Lungs, from whence often ensues shortness of Breath, difficulty of Breathing, and a vehement Cough, which if not in
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>time remedied, brings the Patient into a Consump∣tion; if the Catarrhous Humour translates itself upon the Limbs. Joints, or Nerves, as it will in time if not carried off, there is Pain, Weakness and Trembling.</P>
<P>Sometimes the superfluous Humour is thrown upon the Glandules of the whole Body, which alters their Tone, so that if it happens upon the Glands of the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> there follows a Watry Dispo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition of the whole Body, which sometimes endangers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dropsy or other desperate D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sease.</P>
<P>The Causes of those Rheums are many, as Cor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upt Air, hot Liquors, and Spices taken out of mea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure; but the chief Cause is an over hot, or over cold, or moist Distemperature of the Brain; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome Authors say, that a hot Liver and cold Stomach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the two chief Seminaries of Rheums. But as in every Catarrh it is evident the Matter flows from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Head, that and the Brain are chiefly to be taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are of; so as that they be purged with proper Purges, and after that corroborated, the superfluous Moisture dried up, and the Part or Parts to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Rheum flows, must at last be strengthen'd.</P>
<P>To accomplish this, I know nothing better than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst to purge with my Cephalick Pills, prescrib'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he first Chapter, to be taken every other Day till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Rheum is abated, and also on those Days you do not purge, to take at Night going to Bed, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Morning at rising, a Dose of my Cephalick Elixir, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ikewise prescribed in the said first Chapter, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athe all the Head, Nape of the Neck, Temples and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehind the Ears, with my <HI>Nerve Fotus,</HI> prescribed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Ninth Chapter, which strictly followd, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth remove the offending Humour, corroborate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Head and Brain, and strengthen the weakened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arts, beyond any thing perhaps known or used.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of Melancholly; its Nature, Cause, and Cure.</HEAD>
<P>THO' Melancholly cannot be strictly said to be a Disease of the Head, yet as the Head is oftentimes disturbed by it, it comes properly enough to be spoken of here.</P>
<P>Melancholly, or as some call it, the Hippo, is a sort of Dotage arising from disturbd Phantasms, fill∣ing
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>the Person afflicted with anxious Thoughts and Solitariness, being, as it were, ingulphed therein, with Pensiveness, Fury, or Fever; some are afflict∣ed with a deep Sadness or Pensiveness, without ap∣parent Cause, and a long continued Silence, or else an incongruous Talk at random of some particular Thing. It is caused by a Distemper of the Animal Spirits, hurt by a Malancholly Phantasm or Vapour, made misty, opacous, thick, and dark, almost fix'd and immoveable, and from thence it is that Melan∣cholly People are Tenacious; for that all kinds of Objects are fix'd in their Minds, according to the Condition and Quality of the deprav'd Spirits; and this is acquired either from a default in the Brain, de∣clining from its genuine Whiteness, and generating such like Spirits, or from a default of the Blood and Vital Spirits, or from some degenerate Melancholly Matter, as Humour, Vapour, or both, mingled with the Blood and Spirits. If it proceeds from the Brain, it is known by Sadness, Fearfulness, Hatred, and other strange Imaginations; some think themselves Beasts, some one thing, some another; some would kill themselves, others are afraid, some laugh, some weep, some prophecy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which shews it is from Melancholly Blood.</P>
<P>The Species or Kinds of Melancholly are many, as first, that of the Brain, when it declines in Quality or Substance from its Purity and Cleanness, which is known by a perpetual and vehement Doting, arising either externally, from strange Fancy and Imagi∣nation, as from Fear, Dispair, and such like sad Af∣flictions of the Mind, which dry up the radical Moisture, and cause Cares, Watchings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or inter∣nally, from a Melancholly Humour gathered toge∣ther in the Head, either by some cold or dry Mat∣ter left behind in the Brain, after some hot Distem∣per,
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>the thinner part of the Matter being resolv'd and gone; or from a Melancholly Habit and Constitu∣tion, either Hereditary from the Parents Blood, or from a cold and dry, or hot and dry Disposition of the Body, causing either Doting with Laughter, or a dull Slothfulness, or Anger, Discontent and Peevish∣ness.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> Another kind of Melancholly is that of the whole Body, the Blood having acquired a Melan∣cholly Habit, distributing the same to all the Parts, and then to the Brain; this is known because the Dotage or Delirium is indeed continual, but so that it is with some Exasperations and Remissions, with general Signs of a Melancholly Habit.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> There is another sort of that Distemper, calld the Melancholly of the Heart, when the Vital Spirits that are there bred, by reason of a cold and dry Di∣stemper, are made impure.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly,</HI> There is that which is Hypochondriacal, wherein Melancholly Juice either cold and serous, or adust and burnt, in the Branches of the <HI>Vena Porta,</HI> is gathered together in the Hypochondria, (which occa∣sions the most common sort of Melancholly, from whence, time after time, black Melancholly Vapours are continually sent forth to corrupt the Animal Spirits in the Brain; and this is known by its seizing the Patient by Intervals and certain Seasons, but in its approach, it surprizes without any Notice, except by windy Belchings and a Pain distending the Sto∣mach, with Anxiety of Mind, Difficulty of Brea∣thing, Palpitation of the Heart, Immoveableness of the Tongue, Mist or Darkness before the Eyes, Noise in the Ears, and a Stupidity or Benumbedness in both Arms. These Melancholly Vapours or Humours, are transmitted from the Hypochondria to the Brain, either by the Orifice of the Stomach,
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>as some imagine, or else by the Branches of the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> where they cloud and darken the Spirits.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5thly,</HI> There is Melancholly of the Womb in Wo∣men, which is discovered by a Pain in the Left-side, and a manifest Pulse and Beating in the Back near the <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> being caused by Stoppage of the Courses, or other Natural Evacuations.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6thly,</HI> There is a Melancholly from Love, occa∣sioned either from Philters or Love Potions, or else from a Lustful Appetite, or Desire of Venery, caused from an hot Constitution, and an over abundance of Seed; in which Case the Fancy is not fix'd upon one Person, but the Patient by Fits delights to be in the Company of Men promiscuously, talks leudly, and is ready to call them to her, tho' before, and at other times, she is very Chaste and Modest.</P>
<P>But as the sort of Melancholly which generally afflicts People, is that of the Hypochonders, it may not be amiss to say something more at large of its Nature, and after that of its Cause, before I come to shew the Cure of it.</P>
<P>Hypochondriack Melancholly is a Collection of filthy and vicious Humours in the Branches of the <HI>Vena Porta, Caeliacal</HI> and <HI>Mesenterical</HI> Arteries, by reason of a Fault of the Concoction of the Spleen, without Putrifaction, thence sending many Vapours, causing imminent Symptoms. 'Tis call'd Hypo∣chondriacal, because it possesses the place of both Hypochonders, <HI>viz.</HI> that part of the Body, which under the Bastard or short Ribs, reaches as far as the Loins, on both sides, comprehending with the Mus∣cles the Bowels themselves, and call'd Melancholly, when the Brain is affected by Consent.</P>
<P>Those that are afflicted with Hypochondriack Me∣lancholly, find a Rawness, Windiness, sharp Belchings, Crudities, Burning, and Pain of the Stomach and Sides,
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>which are pluck'd upwards, and sometimes inflamed; the Belly is bound, sleep little, and that with trou∣blesome Dreams, Sadness, given to be Thoughtful, Idle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These are the general Symptoms, but the more particular ones, which People afflicted find more or less, according as they are of Constitution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are ranged as follow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Crudity of the Stomach, so sower sometimes as to set the Teeth an Edge.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Pains in the Stomach, reaching even to the Back, and returning upon Eating,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Costiveness of Body, from an universal Me∣lancholly Habit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. An Inflammation of the Hypochonders, attended with Redness of the Cheeks, and sudden Flushings in the Face.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. Urine sometimes thin and pale like Water, and sometimes thick and troubled with now and then a Sediment of red Sand.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. A Motion of Wind in the left Hypochonder causing great Pain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. Anxiety, caused by Wind distending the Hypochonders, thereby causing a straitness in those Parts, which have Nerves from the sixth Conjuga∣tion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. A Palpitation of the Heart, either from the Malignity of the Vapours in the Part, or by Consent of the Stomach.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. A beating in the Left Hypochonder, caused either by the great Pulsation of the <HI>Caeliacal</HI> Branch of the Arteries after Anger or violent Motion, or by the Compression of the Arteries in the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> by the Glandules being more than ordinarily extended.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. A Dryness in the Mouth, Tongue and Palate, by reason of hot Vapours ascending through the Gullet and rough Artery.</ITEM>
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
<ITEM>XI. A Difficulty of Breathing, both by reason of the Affection of the Nerves dedicated to the Muscles of the Breast, and of the Affusion of evil Matter into the Spaces of the Muscles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XII. A Perturbation of the Brain from Vapours resolv'd, which if they be obscure they darken the Spirits, and cause Melancholly Dotage; if dry, an <HI>Epilepsy</HI> and Watchings; and if many, the Vertigo and a Fear of Strangling, or Stupidity.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These are the Symptoms of Hypochondriack Me∣lancholly, but all of them are rarely to be seen in one Person, the most certain Symptoms that always attend, are Grippings and Wind in the Bowels, a weak Stomach, and sometimes a very keen one, Co∣stiveness, Belchings, Palpitation of the Heart, Pertur∣bations of the Head, and a disturb'd or uneasy Mind.</P>
<P>The Symptoms being thus premised, let us now inquire more particularly after their Cause. The first Cause is a Vicious Acid in the Stomach, inlarg∣ing the Appetite, but unfit for Digestion, hence ensues an Acid Crudity in the first Passages, which depraves the Crasis of the Blood, prevents the due separation of the Volatile Spirits; upon which the Lymphatick Juice becomes Acid, and the Bileous Juice In∣active.</P>
<P>These are the Sources of all the preceding Symp∣toms, since Wind, Noise, Griping in the Guts, and. Costiveness, are the natural Result of a Viscous Acid in the first Passages; as also Flushings in the Face, arising from its Effervessence with the Bile. The Convulsions of the Nervous Membranes in several Parts of the Body, are the Effects of its Irritation; its Crudity impairs the due Fermentation of the Blood, and causes a Palpitation of the Heart, and difficulty in Breathing; it depraves the Nutritious Juice of the Bowels, which settles into hard Swellings, and occa∣sions
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>a Degeneracy and Austerity in the Spirits; hence Fear, Melancholly, irregular Thoughts, and uncouth Emotions ensue.</P>
<P>The Procatartick or remote Causes that promote Crudities, are Acid Liquors, or Salt Victuals, or such as are dried in the Smoak; both which par∣take of the Acid Spirit of Salt or Soot; want of Mo∣tion to promote Digestion, and the speedy Assimi∣lation of Chyle; Nocturnal Study or Care; exhaust∣ing the Blood and rendring the Lympha Acid, which at length brings on a Nervous <HI>Atrophy;</HI> this Disease being an Enemy to the Nervous System.</P>
<P>So much for the Symptoms and Causes of the Hypochondriack Disease, which is generally observ'd to happen to Scorbutick Bodies, and to People of the best Sense and good Understanding, it being seldom seen that Fools and Blockheads are troubled with that Distemper.</P>
<P>This Disease is truly difficult to Cure, by reason of the mighty Heap of Symptoms that commonly at∣tend Persons afflicted with it; it is seldom mortal, but of very long continuance, sometimes lasting even the whole period of Life, for which Reason it is call'd <HI>The Disgrace of Physicians.</HI></P>
<P>If it be attended with continual Pain and Giddi∣ness of the Head, it gives fears of the <HI>Epilepsy, Apo∣plexy,</HI> or Blindness. If it be accompanyed with a moderate Flux of the Belly, (for it is good to be loose, bad to be costive) Vomiting, or Haemorrhoids, it is good, but if those Fluxes continue long, it is dange∣rous. Sometimes the Patient seems to be cured, and then in a few Months it returns again: It is much easier cured if taken in the beginning, and happening to People neither in a full, or declining Age; also Men are easier cured than Women; the Fat and Fair, than the Lean and Swarthy.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
<P>The Cure of this Distemper consists primarily and peculiarly in opening all Obstructions in the Sto∣mach, Bowels and other Passages, by which the Digestions may be perfected and good Chyle assimi∣lated. Secondly in tempering the Evil Quality of the Humours. Thirdly in evacuating the Morbifick Matter. Fourthly in altering the Habit of the Body, and strengthening the weakened Parts.</P>
<P>To accomplish these Four Intentions, Authors prescribe more Medicines than there are Symptoms, and which for any one to follow, would rather per∣plex than profit. Some run altogether on Steel Courses, and prescribe them promiscuously to all; o∣thers are much devoted to Testaceous Pouders, which they call Sweetners; others again to Acids, and o∣thers in opposition to Alcalies. Some are for Volatile Salts and Spirits, others for fix'd Salts and Cardiacks; some highly applaud Emeticks, others condemn them, and cry up Catharticks; others are for Altera∣tives, others for Aperitives. And thus do they vary as their Opinions or Inclinations lead them, without considering with that mature Judgment they ought, or making just Observations; which is the reason so few are cured, or so ordinarily relieved.</P>
<P>But as the whole Cure of this Distemper hinges upon the Four Points mentioned, when those Points are maturely considered, and Medicines accordingly adapted, it is not to be doubted but the end will be accomplish'd; and to speak truly, I never found, where the Patient was steady in the Method pre∣scribed him, but that in the End a Cure was ob∣tained.</P>
<P>To do this, I rely upon the Two Medicines follow∣ing, <HI>viz.</HI> my <HI>Hypochondriacum Digestivum,</HI> and <HI>Pul∣vis Corroborans.</HI> The first answers the Three first Intentions of Cure, and the second the last: But as
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>this Disease is most commonly Chronick and lasting, they must be taken for some time together, or else a Cure▪ cannot be expected, at least wise to be durable, it being the Nature of it to return again, if the Cause be not totally removed, and the Tone of the Parts fully recovered: Therefore the Patient is first to take my <HI>Hypochondriacum Digestivum</HI> for so long time as that he finds no Remains of the Disease, but is free in every Respect from each particular Symptom, and this he may expect to find in about Five or Six Weeks time, if the Disease be not very inveterate; and when the Symptoms are off, he is to take my <HI>Pulvis Corroborans</HI> to strengthen the Tone of the Parts, the Crasis of the Blood being beforehand brought to rights; and that he is to continue for about Three, Four or Five Weeks, or longer if he finds any remaining Weakness, or other Indisposition to give him fear of a return of his Illness.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>My Hypochondriacum Digestivum is thus prepared.</HEAD>
<P><HI>TAKE Filings of Steel, and Salt Armoniack, of each Four Ounces; Pouder the latter, and let the former be clean from Dust, and put them into a Subli∣matory, and Sublime according to Art; when the Glass is cold, open it, and dissolve the sublim'd Matter in as small a Quantity of fair Water as will be sufficient to do it; when it is dissolv'd, filter it, and precipitate the filtrated Liquor, by dropping into it (gradatim and separately) Spi∣rit of Salt Armoniack, and Oil of</HI> Tartar per deliquium <HI>of each as much as you find sufficient; first a few Drops of one and then of the other, and so on alternately, till no∣thing further subsides; pour off the clear Liquor by Incli∣nation, and dry the Precipitate according to Art.

<P>This <HI>Hypochondriacum Digestivum,</HI> is to be taken a Paper at a Time, containing half a Dram every Night and Morning, in a Glass of White-Wine and Water, which will give one Stool, or perhaps two in a Day; but if that Evacuation should be too much to hold it daily, for so long a time as mentioned, then he is to take two thirds of a Paper at a time, or but half a Paper, or less, according as he finds he can bear it.</P>
<P>When the Patient has done with that Medicine as directed, or has taken it for five or six Weeks, then (altho' he should not find himself quite well) it will be best for him, omitting that, to begin the <HI>Pulvis Corroborans,</HI> and take one Paper of it at a time, every Night and Morning mixt in the Morning, in a Glass of <HI>German</HI> Spaw Water, drinking the remainder of the Flask within the compass of an Hour, or Hour and Half after it; and that at Night in a Glass of Red Wine and Water.

<P>He may go abroad with these Medicines, and by all means should use Exercise, during the whole time of his taking them, and none like that of the Horse, to ride every Forenoon, about two Hours after ri∣sing, for an Hour or two, which procures him an Appetite to his Dinner; and to ride again about two Hours more, which facilitates Digestion, and besides that, will, by the shaking, stir up, for natural Evacua∣tions, those stagnating Juices which would other∣wise subside. But by riding I do not mean he must ride hard, either to tire or sweat, but <HI>ad ruborem sed non sudorem,</HI> and so as to be as easy and lightsome when he gets off his Horse, as when he got on. He may eat fresh Meat, and that Heartily, all sorts of Herbs, Fruits, or the like, that are agreeable, and drink now and then a Glass, Two or Three of good Red Wine, such as <HI>Florence, Viana, Portugal,</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Wine; and for his constant Drink he must take Wine and Water, instead of Malt Liquors, all which if he observes, and also follows his Medicines and Riding daily, as di∣rected, his Cure will certainly be effected, as he him
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>self will have reason to believe, by his daily and al∣most hourly mending, after once the Humours begin to be mov'd off, which he will find in about a Week or Ten Days after he has enter'd the Course. By this means I have cured many, and some whose Cases were very inveterate, and as believed by those they had before applyed to for help, incurable. I could give Instances of several with their Names, but the former being inconsistent with the designed Brevity of this Treatise, and being prohibited the latter, I shall only insert one Case, and conclude this Chapter.</P>
<P>A Gentleman highly Scorbutick, fell into a Melan∣cholly with Pains in the Hypochondria, which afflict∣ing him for a long time, vitiated all the Juices of his Body, and wholly subverted the Concoctions, inso∣much, that he had most of the worst Symptoms men∣tioned to attend that Distemper, as flushing Heats, Pains in the Head, Wind, Belchings, Tremblings, Horrors, Frights, and the like, for which he had Purged times without number, Bled, and taken An∣tiscorbuticks of all kinds, with all the Testaceous Pou∣ders, which are reckoned Sweetners; had passed thro' long Courses of Steel, drank all sorts of Mineral Wa∣ters; had suffered the Pennance of Seatons, Issues, Blisters, and Cuppings to ease his Head, which used very much to be disordered, till at length being quite tired out by his Disease and Medicines, he resolved to desist, and as patiently as he could, wait for his ap∣pointed departure, which he was certain to himself could not be long, his Illness being such, as Nature, to his thinking, could not long subsist under. Thus being in a manner, quite worn out, and lamenting his hard Fortune to a Friend, that came to see him, who had been my Patient, he told him what I had done for him and others in Distempers of the Head, and advised him to consult me, which he did, and whom
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>as soon as ever I had heard his Complaints, I told he would certainly be well, if he would observe the Rules I prescribed him, which he heartily promised the News of having his Health again being such as would make him do, he said, any thing. I forth∣with began with him, and gave him the very Medi∣cines I have prescribed, in the Order I have before spoken of, with Directions for him to ride on Horse¦back twice every Day, for Two Hours each time, which he did, and with that wonderful success, that by his Medicines and Exercise, in less than Four Months time, he recovered from all his Indispositions, and attained a Strong, Lively, and Brisk Habit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Body.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of Vapours or Hysterick Fits; their real Cause and Cure.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT I have said in the Chapter before, of Hypochondriack Melancholly, gives some Idea of the Distemper I am now about to speak of, tho' I am not of the Opinion of <HI>Sylvius</HI> and <HI>Willis,</HI> who alledge that the Difference between them is so little, that they are taken to be one and the same. I say I am not of their Opinion, because the same Medi∣cines that Cure the one, have no effect on the other, and that because they affect different Sexes from dif∣ferent Causes, tho' I must allow, that there is an Analogy between them in some Symptoms, and from some Causes, but yet so far from being general, that it is but in some few Particulars; the Symptoms of Vapours or Hysterick Diseases, being incident to the Female Sex chiefly, in the manner Men cannot have them, and are so numerous that a Day will scarce be sufficient to reckon them up.</P>
<P><HI>Democritus</HI> in an Epistle to <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> said, <HI>That the Womb was the Cause of Six Hundred Miseries, and of innumerable Calamities,</HI> and among them reckons Hysterick Fits or Vapours, whence it is plain, he concludes that they arise from a distemperature of the Womb, concerning which, I shall by and by speak.</P>
<P>The Vapours or Hysterick Fits, together with the Hypochondriack Disease, are the most frequent of all Chronick Distempers; the Vapours few Women are wholly free from, more or less; and those Men that lead Sedentary Lives and Study hard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are com∣monly afflicted with Hypochondriack Melancholly.</P>
<P>The Vapours or Hysterick Fits, are not only fre∣quent to Women, but are so wonderfully various,
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>that they resemble almost all the Diseases poor Mor∣tals are subject to; for whatever Parts they seat themselves in, they presently produce such Symptoms as belong to those Parts when primarily affected with a real Distemper: As for Instance, if the Vapours seize the Head, they produce some Disorder or other there; or if the Spirits, some violent Commotions of Mind are presently occasioned, and so of the rest.</P>
<P>This Distemper is call'd the Hysterick or Uterine Passion, because the Authors that first wrote about it, thought that the Womb was principally affected in it, by reason it commonly invaded Maids, married Women, and Widows both old and young, which Opinion is not fully agreed to, tho' we can't but say it is fomented and sustained, by a Fault that is in the Womb, as well as the other Viscera, which the cu∣ring it by Medicines adapted to the Womb demon∣strates, yet it principally proceeds from a Fault in the Blood and Spirits, injured by bad Humours, from Cold, ill Food, Trash, and the like, which stagnating by the Patient's Sedentary or Idle Life, depraves the Blood, and gives it a bad Disposition, able to produce the Hysterick Passion; of which by treating we mean not one, but a whole Army of Distempers, at least in outward shew, it being a Disease that pro∣duces Head-achs, Giddiness, Convulsive Motions Palpitations of the Heart, Rumblings and Agitations of the Stomach and Guts, Difficulty of Breathing Hickup, loss of Senses both External and Internal, by which Physicians speak of them under divers Heads tho' they be from one and the same Cause.</P>
<P>This Distemper call'd Vapours or Hysterick Passion in Women, is not always attended with the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Number of Symptoms, nor are the Symptoms th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same, or equally violent in all, for in some the Suffo∣cation and Difficulty of Breathing are but slight, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>others very severe; therefore in describing the Symp∣toms, it is not to be understood that they are less the Vapours, because they have not all of them, for some feel the Symptoms as aforesaid in the Head, and there is Giodiness, Swimming, Pain, and the like. In others, the Vital parts are affected, which occa∣sions so great a Palpitation of the Heart, that the Patient verily believes the By-standers may hear the sound of the Heart thumping upon the Ribs. Some it affects so, as to cause Coughing without intermis∣sion, but they expectorate nothing. Sometimes the Vapoury Humours fall upon the Parts between the Stomach a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Bowels and occasion violent Pain, much like the <HI>Illiack Passion,</HI> and cause the Women to Vomit a green matter like porraceous Bile. Some∣times the Spirits are so seized, that the Patient is op∣pressed with great Anguish of Mind, and wholly dispairs of Recovery with Dejections, and as it were a certain Desperation. Sometimes this Disease falls upon the Kidneys, and causes Pain like the Stone, or Stone Cholick. Sometimes it falls on the Bladder (tho' seldom) and stops the Urine, as if there was a Stone there. Sometimes it falls upon the Sto∣mach, and causes continual Vomiting, and some∣times upon the Bowels, and then a Looseness follows, but generally no Pain accompanies either of these Symptoms, tho oftentimes in both, the green Hu∣mour aforementioned, appears either by Vomit or Stool.</P>
<P>And as this Disease afflicts almost all the inward Parts, so sometimes it seizes all the outward Parts and Musculous Flesh, occasioning Pain, and sometimes a Tumour in the Jaws, Shoulders, Hands, Thighs and Legs, of which kind, that Tumour which swells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Legs is more conspicuous than the rest; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese Pains and Swellings, afflicting the outward Parts,
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>chiefly seize those Women that are in a manner quite destroy'd by a long Series and Force of the Vapours.</P>
<P>But amongst all the Torments of this Disease, there is none so common as a Pain in the Back, which most certainly all Women feel, how little soever they are afflicted with the Vapours. It is also com∣mon, that after the Pains are gone off, there is such a stiffness of the Parts, or Numbness or Soreness, as if beaten, so that the Patient cannot bear to have the Places touch'd; but this Tenderness goes off by de∣grees. And this amongst the rest is worth observ∣ing, That all Hysterick Women complain of a De∣jection and Sinking of the Spirits, who when they would shew the place where the sinking of the Spi∣rits is, point to the Region of the Lungs.</P>
<P>Yet of all the Symptoms that attend this Disease, nothing is more common or inseparable, and more shews the Patient to be troubled with Vapours, than that their Urine is as clear as Rock-water, and comes away, when they make it, in a plentiful quantity-especially when they have just before found them∣selves faint, ill, or sickish. Moreover, Women much troubled with Vapours belch up ill Fumes as often as they eat, tho' they only eat moderately, and as they have an Appetite. Also they sometimes in their Fits laugh exceedingly, and some times cry as much, without any real Cause for either.</P>
<P>The efficient Cause of this Disease, in my Opinion, proceeds from a Confusion of the Spirits; the origin and antecedent Cause of which Confusion, is the weak Constitution of the Spirits and <HI>Genus Nervosum,</HI> and that weak Constitution injured as before said, is the Cause of the many Symptoms that are attend∣ing, as we have in somewhat particular terms ennumerated.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
<P>As to the Prognosticks, this Disease seldom kills the Patient, yet sometimes it snatches them away when the Fit is intense and lasts very long, or else draws on an Apoplexy or Syncope.</P>
<P>Of the several degrees of the Vapours or Hysterick Fits, <HI>That</HI> is the worst, in which many Parts suffer Convulsions, and the Exercise of the Senses is inter∣rupted; but <HI>That</HI> is slighter, where the Mind is un∣touched, or the right use of it not taken away, and but one or two Parts are convulsed, especially if the Vital Functions remain entire. In ancient People it is hardly curable, because in them the Habit is con∣tracted; in young Women it sometimes ceases of it self, as they grow in Years, or when they begin to have Chindren. Hysterick Fits are dangerous to Women with Child, and in Child-bed, to the first for fear of miscarrying, and to the last by reason of their Weakness got in Labour.</P>
<P>The Cure of the Vapours is twofold, in the Fit, especially when it is violent and of long duration, and out of the Fits, to prevent their coming again. Authors to bring the Patient out of the Fit, advise hard rubbing in the lower Parts, and Scarification in the Hips; they recommend likewise the pulling out the Hairs, the twisting of the Fingers, the putting to the Nose Foeted things, as Assafaetida, Galbanum, burnt Feathers or Leather, Brimstone lighted, the Smoak of Tobacco, Spirit, or Salt of Hartshorn, Armoniack, sharp Snuff, of white Hellebore, Eupho∣bium, or the like, some of which have done, and may do good, when the Fit is not very extream; but in all Cases of Desperation, and also where the Fit is not very violent, (because the sooner the Patient is brought out of the Fit the better) I use my Apople∣ctick Species prescribed in the 8th Chapter aforego∣ing blowing a very little of it up each Nostril, which
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>instantly brings the Patient to her self, that she is not so fatigued, nor her Spirits so worn or spent, as they generally are if the Fit continues for a long time; this and this alone I have used times without Number, with all the success imaginable, and therefore can and do with the more freedom recommend it, it being, I believe, the only thing to save Life, where there is danger, in any sudden Fit of any kind, in Old or Young.</P>
<P>I was once call'd to a Lady, taken of a sudden with a Fit of the Vapours, which she had been many Years subject to, tho' nothing near so violent as then; several Surgeons were instantly call'd, as well as Neighbours and Friends, who when they came, thought she was dying, some that she was dead, no Life or Breath, to appearance, being left. The Sur∣geons bled her, used Oil of Amber, Spirit of Harts∣horn, and the like, but nothing moved her. I came after she was blooded, and seeing her Case, and the Consternation all about her were in, immediately blew up into each Nostril, with a Quill, a little o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my said Apoplectick Species; it was not the tenth part of a Minute after its Use, but she began t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> snort, and a little while after to sneeze, which brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her to herself forthwith, tho' she had been almost a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hour lifeless, to all appearance, and reported abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be dead. After that, I was desired to give he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what I judged proper to prevent those Fits for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> future, which I did, as I shall presently relate, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she never had any since, it being now three Year ago, tho she was before, many time in a Year, subjec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Fits of the Vapours more or less.</P>
<P>Intirely to cure Vapours or Hysterick Fits, Au∣thors direct long Courses of many and various Med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cines, and advise outward as well as inward Appl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cations, which I have observed very frequently to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>more harm than good; but I take these Authors to be wrong in their Fundamentals, I mean as to the Causes of the Disease, for if it proceeds from what I have a little before given my Opinion it does, a few Medicines rightly adapted will Cure; and that the Disease does proceed from those Causes, is evident by the Success of the Medicine I give, which indeed is but one, tho' compounded of several Ingredients, and that made up into Pills, which I call, and rightly to, my Vapour Pills; for if a Dose or two of them be but taken where there are any Symptoms of the Fit's approaching, or where there is any Perturbation of the Spirits, they immediately dispel all those fuli∣ginous Vapours, and raise the faint, depress'd Spirits, giving them such a Turn, that the Patient is as brisk and well as if nothing at all had afflicted her; and if they be taken continually, Three at Night, and Three every Morning, for some time, Drinking two or three Spoonfuls of Wine, or any other agreeable Li∣quor after them, they not only regulate and clear the Spirits, but amend and purify the Blood and bring it to a due Crasis; tho' in Constitutions much debilitated by the length of the Disease, I advise with them, the <HI>German</HI> Spaw-Water, a Flask every Day, which by diluting and washing off the Peccant Salts in the Blood, gives the Vapour Pills the better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oom to extend their Efficacy, that by them, and the other good Qualities of that famed Mineral Water, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Patient amends every Day, getting Health and Strength apace; for these Pills powerfully regulate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Spirits, and Strengthen them and the <HI>Genus Ner∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osum,</HI> keep up the Appetite, rectify the Blood, con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rm its Tone, and do all that is requisite to cure the Distemper; there not being, I think I may be bold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o say, a better Medicine, or any other Method to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e advised to cure that Disease so easily, expedi∣tiously

<P>The happy Effects of those Vapour Pills, which neither Purge or disorder the Body in the least, I found in a late Patient, who was so extreamly over∣whelm'd with the Vapours, that she was never well, either in Mind or Body, nor free from them a Day together. Sometimes she would have flushing Heats in her Hands and Face, at other times cold Sweats, at other times a trembling all over her, with Weak∣ness in her Limbs that she could scarce walk. Some∣times Pains in her Head, that she could not rise from her Pillow all Day. Othertimes she would fall into Cryings, Fears, Dreads, and ruminate on a Thou∣sand dismal Things. Sometimes she would call out for help, for that she was dying and could not live a Minute, and would be in a Rage with those that told her there was no danger Sometimes she would foollishly laugh at nothing all of a sudden, and pre∣sently after Cry. Sometimes rave, scold, and be angry at every thing. Sometimes she would be mute, and not speak a Word, nor Eat or Drink. In this Con∣dition, which was very unhappy to all about her as well as to her self, she took advice of many, and was, as she hoped, sometimes better, but her going through many Courses for a long time to so little Benefit, tired out her Husband's Purse as well as her own Person, insomuch, that they resolv'd to leave off and see what Nature would do, which alas! was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo feeble to struggle through her difficulties; which they seeing, and, by means of a certain Lady whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had before cured, hearing of my Vapour Pills she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, as she said, to talk with me, despairing thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er whole Discourse of any Help. I ordered her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o take my Vapour Pills, which she did with Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uctancy, not believing they would do her any good, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to drink the <HI>German</HI> Spaw-Water with them,
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>which by her Friends perswasions she consented to do, and in less than Three Weeks time, contrary to her Faith, she grew so well that in her own Opinion she then believed she should be cured. I advised her to proceed in the Course, which was nothing more than to take Three of my Vapour Pills every Night and Morning, and an Hour after the Morning Dose to drink to Flask of <HI>German</HI> Spaw-Water, taking Two Hours time for the drinking it by moderate Draughts (which is much better than to drink it too quick o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too much at a Draught) which she did as I directed, and used at the same time moderate Exercise of Walk∣ing, and Riding in a Chaise, as I advited, for about Nine Weeks, in which time she was perfectly reco∣vered, and was, and is at the writing of this, as com∣pleatly well as if she had never been ill. And this these Vapour Pills do, and tho' they keep the Body gently soluble, yet comfort and strengthen the Spi∣rits and Vitals, being certainly the greatest Altera∣tive, Riviving, Refreshing Medicine in those Cases that is known.</P>
