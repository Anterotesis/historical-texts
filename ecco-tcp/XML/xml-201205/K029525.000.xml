<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE putrid Sore-Throat has so long continued in this na∣tion, almost every year with a new train of symptoms, as the celebrated Dr. Fothergill foresaw, "it is pro∣bable, says that great practitioner, in his Account on the Sore-Throat, that this kind of Sore-Throat may continue amongst us for the future, breaking out with more or less se∣verity, as season, situation, and
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>other circumstances may concur." And in another place, he says, "It may also be necessary to observe, that the disease is described as it appear∣ed in 1747 and 1748; that if the symptoms should hereafter vary in any circumstance, the diversity may be attributed to the nature of the disease, and not imputed to design or inattention," a descrip∣tion therefore of this raging disease can never be thought useless, espe∣cially as the symptoms seem to dif∣fer in some respect from the for∣mer.</P>
<P>I am conscious that an accurate description of diseases, and their me∣thod of treatment, requires both great
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>abilities and great practice, neither of which I am able to boast; but as I have had in this disease frequent opportunities of making various observations, as a great many came under my inspection, I think it nei∣ther presumption nor arrogance to lay them along with the history of the diseases before the Publick; per∣haps it may excite men of greater sagacity and practice, to give the world their more precise and more learned observations, and then I shall not think my labour ineffec∣tual or unrewarded.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>BOUT the 15th of July, a Sore-Throat of the malig∣nant kind, nearly such as described by Dr. Fothergill, and Dr. Huxham, (only without the ef∣florescence, and attended with costiveness) made its appearance among children from three to seven years of age, by which many were cut off in the space of six or eight days; some by suffocation, and others by vomiting of blood: at the same time, a complaint of a roughness in the throat,
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>most probably arising from a deprivation of its mucus, prevailed among adults, with∣out the least appearance of ulceration or malignancy, which however in a few days yielded to an external application of the volatile liniment or camphorated oil.</P>
<P>About the beginning of August, the same Sore-Throat extended its baleful in∣fluence more generally, chiefly attacking children from three to ten years of age, and also a few adults, of a lax and ill habit of body; in some it was very malignant, joined with an erysipelatose inflammation and a diarrhea; the degree of malignancy however seemed to have been more adapted to the situation than to the constitution of the patients, insomuch that the disease was very fierce in low, marshy, and con∣fined, and extremely benign in high and open places; thus in <HI>Hampstead</HI> and <HI>High∣gate</HI> it was very slight, whereas in <HI>Kentish∣town</HI> it raged with great fury, and in <HI>End∣field-Chace</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>it swept away many in the space of twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>The disease was not uniform, but seemed to have been of two kinds; in some there appear∣ed only a superficial whiteness on the <HI>uvula Tonsils</HI> and <HI>velum palatinum,</HI> whilst in others those parts were beset with thick ulcerations, running very deep in the fauces, so as to be almost invisible; in both species however, about the second or third d y, hard swel∣lings appeared externally on each side the neck, almost meeting together upon the throat, which occasioned a stiffness of the neck, lasting in some for a month.</P>
<P>Though the attack of the disease was dif∣ferent in different persons, yet most of them were taken with a nausea and shiverings, suc∣ceeded by heat and an efflorescence over the breast and extremities, and often the whole body was of a crimson red; some were spread over with a kind of little millets, similar to that in the miliary fever, and which scaled off the skin the sixth or se∣venth
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>day; in which cases the ulcerations were very slight, as also all other symptoms of malignancy: in all the different kinds of the efflorescence, most of the patients com∣plained of a violent itching, and had a dry and hot skin; the pulse was commonly small, quick, and sometimes fluttering and unequal; the mouth full of sloughs, the teeth black and covered with a crust; the tongue white, sometimes a little furred, but frequently beset with blisters; the lips parched; the <HI>tonsils</HI> and <HI>uvula</HI> were of∣ten so much enlarged, that every thing at∣tempted to be swallowed was ejected by the nose; the urine was commonly discharged in small quantities, high coloured, and a thin cloud suspended in its middle; some discharged a small quantity of blood for a few days out of the nose; the nose was stuffed up with a greenish <HI>sanies,</HI> which dropped out continually, and seemed not to be of an excoriating nature, but rather to occasion only a slight titillation, as a constant picking of the nose was observa∣ble
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>in all those cases. Some were costive, whilst others were afflicted with a species of an autumnal dysentry, as their stools ap∣peared knotty, such as described by my ingenious and sagacious friend, Dr. Wilson, in his treatise on the Autumnal Dysentry; the purging and efflorescence however did not seem to correspond with one another; for, first, the disappearance of the one sel∣dom aggravated the other; secondly, they were often concomitant; thirdly, some∣times a costiveness attended, though there was not any efflorescence; nor did the efflorescence appear to be a critical dis∣charge, as is the case in eruptive diseases of the malignant kind, for the efflorescence and the Sore-Throat were often met with separately. A cough attended in most throughout the whole disease, probably occasioned by the irritation of the <HI>larynx;</HI> great depression of strength, dejection of spirits, a total inactivity, a delirium, a pulse that beat 140 or 145 in a minute, and a great disponae, were fatal omens.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
<P>It was remarkable that though most of the young patients had a great aversion to all manner of food, yet they seemed not un∣willing to take medicines, which made me imagine that immediate relief was found from it.</P>
<P>The disease had neither an apparent crisis, nor any regular progress; for all the symptoms often vanished of a sudden about the eighth or ninth day, whilst at other times they were at a stand for about 14 days; but frequently they diminished or increased from the 10th to the 14th or 15th day, when either a total recovery was seen, excepting the external swelling, which lasted often for weeks; or the scene of life was closed, the patient suffocating or expiring in a lingering way. In one case only, which I shall mention hereafter, I beheld all the malignant symptoms in the highest degree, the patient labouring under them for three weeks, and at last reco∣vered.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
<P>An oedematous swelling, after the ab∣sence of all the fatal symptoms, and when nothing but an entire recovery was ex∣pected, appeared to be very frequent in children of an ill habit of body; the lips, nose and face were bloated, sallow, shining, and greasy, as it were, which swelling spread itself sometimes over one side, and at others over the whole body, especially the abdo∣men; the swelling I have observed to in∣crease always in the morning, and to abate towards evening. Dr. Huxham, in his dissertation on the Malignant Ulce∣rous Sore-Throat, has observed the same; but only "before the fatal period," not after a total recovery; nor does he take notice of that particular circumstance concerning its increase and abatement, dif∣ferent from all other dropsical swellings: however, some have been carried off by it a month after the first invasion of the disease, whilst many recovered by the use of proper cathartics and full doses of the bark.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
<P>This disease was sometimes mistaken for the measles, not only because the cough being an idiopatic symptom of the same, but because the efflorescence in the benign kind was so very similar to those of the measles, and which were also epidemical the latter end of August: great mischief would have been done in treating it according to the mistake, with expectorants, opiates, and antiphlogistics; but the very aspect of the throat, even in the benign kind, the ex∣ternal swellings, and the cough itself so different from that of the measles, where it is much stronger and deeper, if I am allowed this expression, could soon detect the error; though I had often occasion to think that some patients were attacked with both diseases at once, and then I have treated them accordingly.</P>
<P>If we consider that in this epidemic the efflorescence appeared often indepen∣dent of the <HI>angina,</HI> and was similar to the miliary or scarlet fever, that further, no
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>great connexion has been observed be∣tween the <HI>diarrhoea</HI> and the efflorescence, and the disappearance of the latter did not always aggravate the former; more∣over, that often a constipation accompanied the whole disease, notwithstanding the absence of the efflorescence; again, that both the angina and the erysepelatose in∣flammation often appeared separately, and that the stools were similar to those of the autumnal dysentry; I say, considering all these circumstances, it seems as if the efflorescence were not always a critical discharge, as is the case in most putrid diseases of the pustular kind; but that the genuine and principal disease was the epidemic Sore-Throat, which began early in summer, and consequently, to speak in the language of Sydenham, was either an early autumnal, or a late vernal epidemic, to which in autumn two other epidemics, namely, either the scarlet or mi∣liary fever, and a purging, like the autumnal dysentry were joined; the first, and genuine
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>epidemic, namely, the Sore-Throat, being at the same time predominant, as often observed by the great Sydenham; and though that great observer attributed epi∣demics to the occult, and not to the sensi∣ble qualities of the air, yet latter obser∣vers favour the contrary opinion, as it appears from the writings of Dr. <HI>Shaw, Arbuthnot</HI> on Air, Dr. <HI>Hale</HI>'s Statical Ex∣periments, Dr. Huxham <HI>de aere et morb. epid.</HI> and others; and it is very probable, that the present arose from the frequent showers and stormy winds, which continu∣ed the greatest part of June and July, though often with easterly winds, yet the sun piercing through the clouds in the intervals of the showers might have much contributed to the epidemic in question, warning the floating vapours, and pro∣ducing a change in the constitution of the air, which, when bred in, has in adults, only affected the mucus membrane of the Throat, and occasioned there a roughness; whereas in child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, and those of a lax∣habit,
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>it has introduced its malignancy deep∣er, and brought on putrid ulceration; the sultry and warm autumn then approaching has roused again, as it were, the lurking epidemic, which then spread itself more general, and more malignant joined with two autumnal epidemics: these, how∣ever, are only probable conjectures, which I shall quit, and return to the method of treating the disease.</P>
<P>As the principal disease was of the malignant kind, antisceptics, the king of which the bark may justly be called, were the first indications, a vomit has some∣times cut the disease short, and which, in the first onset of the disease, ought never to be omitted, as it rouses the nervous system, and the principles of life, the energy of which it so much depends upon in the removal of putrid diseases; and as it clears the stomach of its crudities; for the powers of digestion are always im∣paired in putrid attacks, especially in the
<PB N="20" REF="17"/>present case, where most probably the <HI>oesophagus,</HI> and perhaps the stomach itself were affected: however, as most com∣monly physical assistance was sought for some days after the invasion, emetics could not always have been administered with safety, especially when the fauces were much ulcerated. The admission of free and pure air was highly recommended, as many pati∣ents panted for the free air, and which I never found doing any harm, insomuch that three children afflicted with the dis∣ease came to me every other day at the Asylum, which Cases I shall mention here-after. The room in which the patient lay was frequently sprinkled with vinegar; a gargle, or rather an injection in the Throat, was administered of a strong de∣coction of the bark and the tincture of myrrh, with which also the mouth was continually washed: internally, the bark was given, sometimes with the spirit of minderery, and at others with the cardiac confection, according to the degree of the
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>fever. The camphorated oil, or the vola∣tile leniment, was applied to disperse the external swellings; for as they seemed to be of a malignant nature, it was not ad∣viseable to invite, by poulticing them, more humours thither, for fear of converting a greater quantity of matter into a malig∣nant nature, and consequently increasing the disease; nor did blisters seem to have been of any efficacy in either lessening the degree of the malignancy or the size of the swellings, though, in compliance with common practice, they were sometimes ordered, when they occasioned a great dis∣charge of a thick matter, but without the least relief to the patient; bleeding and antiphlogistics were seldom requisite; and those who have been treated in the strict cold regimen were only protracted in their misery. In cases of costiveness, I ordered for the patient to eat prunes boiled with sena and a little of the powder of ginger in it, as they served also for nourishment, especially as there was an aversion to all
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>manner of food. Where a purging atten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed it was moderated by cordials, and often only by the bark, with the addition of the <HI>confect. card.</HI> or a few drops of the <HI>tinct. thebaic.</HI> and which relieved the pa∣tient often by bringing on a gentle diapho∣rasis, to promote which, plenty of warm and diluting liquors were also recommended.</P>
<P>The oedematous swelling, that appeared in many eight days after a total recovery, was best removed by repeated doses of ca∣lomel and rhubarb, and full doses of the bark; and as far as I have been able to ob∣serve, that dreadful symptom seldom hap∣pened where proper cathartics were admi∣nistered after the disease, to carry off the remainder of the putrid <HI>colluvies,</HI> lodging in the intestinal tube.</P>
<P>As in many cases the young patients could not be prevailed upon to take medi∣cines, a foot, bath of bran, and sometimes cataplasms of horse-radish and mustard were
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>ordered with success, both in pro∣moting by their stimulus the energy of the nerves, and in bringing on a revulsion: and indeed, as in Germany such methods are too frequently used, so are they here too much neglected. That applications to the lower region have a great influence upon the up∣per parts of the system, is evident from the following simple experiment: I felt often a coughing and a <HI>dispon</HI> coming on suddenly, upon holding may feet in cold water, which shews the great sympathy between the nerves of the feet and those of the lung, diaphragm, and of the <HI>trachi,</HI> so that cold applied to the feet will irritate the nerves of the lungs, &amp;c. Upon the same principle, any stimulus ap∣plied, to the feet will rouse the nerves of the upper region, and give them energy. Such remote applications must even have a better effect than when the stimulus is applied immediately to the affected parts, or near them, for it may often bring on alarming symptoms, by increasing the
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>weakness of the already debilitated and ten∣der parts, as I have seen putrefactions take place where the blister was, when applied near the affected part, and which putrefac∣tion made so rapid a progress, that it was not in the power of art to stop it; remote applications therefore, such as cataplasms and semicupiums, are certainly more sa∣lutary and less dangerous: not to mention the inconvenience arising from blisters, when the cantharides are absorbed in a sys∣tem that has a tendency to putrefaction. Even in deliriums, applications to the feet, such as mentioned above, are preferable to either blisters or opiates, for the former may often increase the delirium by in∣creasing its cause, debility, as observed be∣fore, and the latter may aggravate the dis∣ease, by diminishing the sensibility, and consequently the energy of the nerves, so requisite to counteract all putrid diasthasis. The semicupium is frequently used in Germany in the beginning of eruptive diseases, especially in the small-pox, where
<PB N="25" REF="22"/>it often relieves the nobler parts from their fatal invasion. Dr. Wilson assured me, that he always ordereth it, and never found any dangerous consequence of a paralyses, as has been insinuated by some; but as the disease in question is somewhat similar to the small-pox, might not the se∣micupium be of the same use?</P>

<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG lady of a delicate habit of body, about six years old, was taken September the 22d, 1777, with all the symptoms at once; a nausea, great fainting, and an efflorescence all over the body, much like little mellets, a difficulty of swallowing, stiffness of the neck, and costiveness; under which symptoms she laboured three days, on the fourth I saw her, and found a small ulceration on the <HI>uvula</HI> and <HI>tonsils,</HI> with a large swelling of each side the throat; her pulse was 130, the skin dry and hot, the urine high colour∣ed, and a cloud suspended in it, no sanies discharge of the nose, though she picked it continually; the palate much inflamed, and the tongue white; I ordered a vomit, blistered the top of the neck, recommended the admission of free air, and the bark was
<PB N="27" REF="24"/>ministered, with the addition of 8 drops of the <HI>theb. tinct.</HI> in the night draught; there was neither a disponoe nor the usual croaking noise; the volatile liniment was applied to the swellings, and the mouth was continually washed with a decoction of the bark, and tinct. of myrrh; the symptoms began to subside daily, and the ninth day she was quite recovered, only that a stiffness in the neck remained; the efflorescence also remaining till the four∣teenth day, when it began to scale off. I have seen many other cases in which either the efflorescence or swelling last for near a month, after all the other symptoms; in some there was a hoarseness remaining for months. The efflorescence therefore does not seem to be a critical discharge, as is the case in putrid disorders of the pustu∣lar kind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="case study">
<PB N="28" REF="25"/>
<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>MERRYMAN, a girl about seven years of age, was taken, October 14th, with a nausea, vomiting, and a diarrhoea, the second day the sickness abated; but a purging of knotty stools still remained; a swelling appeared on both sides the neck, which almost met together upon the throat; her pulse was 135; there was a discharge of a sanies matter through the nose; the mouth full of slime and slough, the teeth very black, the tongue furred, she picked her nose constantly, and the <HI>uvula</HI> and <HI>ton∣sils</HI> were so much enlarged, that every thing taken in the mouth could hardly be swal∣lowed, but was ejected by the nose. Here the great use of medicines was so obvious, insomuch, that whenever the child could not be prevailed on to take them, all the symptoms grew worse; yet as soon as the
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>medicines mentioned in Case I. were taken, an amazing change followed. As I saw the child in this state of alternate relapse and recovery for fifteen days, I would not trust any longer to her whims, but ordered glysters, which her mother would not give her; I had then refuge to semi∣cupiums and cataplasms, by which means all the symptoms gradually abated; and though that child seemed to recover in a lingering way, yet in the beginning of November she was so much better, that she condescended to take the bark, and which in a few days restored her entirely.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>OCTOBER the 5th I was called to see two sisters, the one eight and the other nine years of age; both had the confluent small-pox six months before;
<PB N="30" REF="27"/>they were so malignant in the youngest, that the apothecary then attending des∣paired of her recovery, which proves that her constitution was much disposed to putridity: however, both were seized with nausea, shivering succeeded by heat, great depression of strength and inactivity. They were in a comatose state; the throat was ulcerated, but the ulceration was so deep in the fauces as to be hardly perceptible; the tongue was full of blis∣ters, white, and a little furred; the lips black and parched; the teeth very black; an efflorescence all over the body; great swelling on each side the neck, and a purging of knotty stools attended; the pulse of the youngest beat 140 in a mi∣nute, and that of the eldest 130, and in general all the symptoms were more vio∣lent in the youngest. I ordered, a vomit; the cortex with the <HI>confect. card.</HI> to be taken internally; the mouth to be washed, and the throat to be syringed with a de∣coction of the bark, and the tinct. of
<PB N="31" REF="28"/>myrrh; and a blister was laid on the back; the symptoms were at a stand till the twelfth day, when after the blisters had discharged plenty of a thick matter, a mortification came on, on the place were the blister laid, and which carried the young∣est off in three days, in spite of all anti∣sceptics that were administered to stop it, as she was really putrified; for blisters were tried, a few days before the mortifica∣tion came, on different parts, which did not draw at all. The eldest, however, mended gradually, and was entirely reco∣vered the 19th, went abroad, eat and drank hearty; but to my greatest surprise, the 25th, her nose and lips began to be bloated, and of a greasy look; an oedematous swel∣ling spread itself over her right side and abdomen which increased remarkably towards morning. Repeated doses of calomel and rhubarb were administered, and the bark in full doses; the swel∣lings, seemed to, abate the third day after
<PB N="32" REF="29"/>its invasion; but the fourth and fifth day the child could not swallow at all, and convulsive fits, the last struggle of life, closed the miserable scene on the 29th of October.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE IV.</HEAD>
<P>OCTOBER the 20th I was called to see a girl about three years of age. I looked in her throat, and found it slightly ulcerated; her pulse beat 130 in a mi∣nute; she was attacked with nausea, and shiverings succeeded by heat, and an efflorescence all over the body; a costive∣ness and great thirst attended throughout the whole disease: there were no outward swellings, nor any great anxiety. I ordered her prunes boiled with sena to keep the body open, and to afford her some nourishment,
<PB N="33" REF="30"/>a great aversion against all manner of food, and the bark with the <HI>spirit mind,</HI> were administered along with the usual syringe and wash for the mouth and throat. The symptoms were at a stand for eight days; the 28th the efflorescence disappeared, the costiveness still remaining along with a hoarseness, which lasted for three weeks; sudorifics and the bark were given, and she recovered entirely. Both her sisters, one eight, and the other ten years of age, were taken two days after, with all the symp∣toms, similar to the first, excepting they had large and hard external swellings, and a great stiffness of the neck, which was inclined to the right shoulder, and whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h they could not move without the greatest pain; they were treated in the same man∣ner, with the addition of the camphorated oil to the swellings, and they recovered nearly at the 30th of October; five days after they were all attacked with the oede∣matous swelling, as mentioned in Case Ill.
<PB N="34" REF="31"/>but by the administration of cathartics and the bark they all recovered six days after the attack.</P>

<P>JEREMIAH WRAY, aged three years, of a weak constitution, was re∣commended to the Asylum, October the 22d, by Mr. Babbs; the child was seized two days before with nausea and vomiting, succeeded by shiverings and heat, an efflorescence all over the body, and a pur∣ging; when he came to the Asylum I found his throat ulcerated, and swellings on both sides the neck, his pulse 130 strokes in a minute, and he was in a comatose state; the decoction of the bark, with the <HI>confect.

The symptoms were at a stand till the 14th of October; when the efflorescence and the purging both abated, the swellings began to subside; and the 3d November he was quite recovered, and returned thanks.</P>

<HEAD>CASE VII.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM ROOTER, aged six years, came recommended by Cham∣berling, Esq. October 14; he was attacked three days before with a sickness, succeed∣ed by a slight fever; I found his throat deep∣ly ulcerated, the <HI>uvula</HI> and <HI>tonsils</HI> covered
<PB N="37" REF="34"/>with sloughs, an outward swelling on the right side the neck, but there was neither an efflorescence nor purging; on the con∣trary, he was costive throughout the whole disease; laxitives were ordered to keep his body open, and the bark was administered, he was treated nearly as those men∣tioned in Cases IV. and V. excepting the blister, which I omitted; he came every other day to the Asylum, and returned thanks the 29th October.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="35"/>
<P>MY ingenious friend, Dr. Lettsom, whose practice is extensive and observations accurate, informed me, that he generally observed that a fever, with alternate shi∣verings and hot fits, and a pain and diffi∣culty in swallowing, attended the first on∣set of this disease; a nausea, head-ach, restlessness, and a sensation of general soreness of the body, and other symptoms of fever, were, also present in greater or less degree, even before any ulceration of the <HI>tonsils</HI> took place; its approach how∣ever might be ascertained by the enlarge∣ment of these glands, and the livid ap∣pearance and turgescence of their vessels. An efflorescence of the skin most general∣ly appeared at this time, and a flushing and bloatedness of the face.</P>
<P>The ulcerations of the <HI>tonsils</HI> usually be∣gan to slough off about the fourth or fifth day, but a low remittent fever continued frequently for some days afterwards, as did
<PB N="39" REF="36"/>likewise the efflorescence; and as the fever ceased, this gradually vanished, and fell off in bran-like scales, and all the symp∣toms subsided.</P>
<P>When the angina was more violent in its attack, the sloughs were not removed till the seventh or eighth day; about which period, when the patient appeared more favourable, considerable and unequal swel∣lings in one or both sides of the neck arose, and these, if not discussed in two or three days, formed large tedious sup∣purations, which either discharged ex∣ternally, or behind the <HI>uvula,</HI> or carried off the patient by suffocation, or by de∣bility; but most generally in these ma∣lignant cases the ulcerations spread infe∣riorly, producing the angina trachaealis, which often proved fatal in grown persons, as well as in infants. These ulcerations likewise extended along the whole, mem∣branes of the mouth and nostrils; in such instances particularly, a delirium almost
<PB N="40" REF="37"/>constantly supervened, and many died in a state of raving, which made him suspect that the erysipelatous inflammation might extend to the membranes contiguous to the brain.</P>
<P>The eruption often put on a peculiar appearance in this virulent state of the disease; instead of falling off in scales, numerous little suppurations might be dis∣covered upon the skin, a little larger than the miliary eruption, and sometimes as broad as a silver penny; they contained purulent matter, which might be disco∣vered upon opening them.</P>
<P>A dysentery sometimes preceded the an∣gina, oftener however it came on about the third or fourth day; the discharges were dark-coloured, offensive and thin. Dysenteries also prevailed with angina, particularly in October. While it was requisite to evacuate these foetid congesti∣ons in the abdomen by mild means; large
<PB N="41" REF="38"/>and sudden evacuations were apt to aug∣ment the debility.</P>
<P>Dr. Lettsom also observed, that the country in the vicinity of London, suf∣fered much likewise, especially in the vil∣lages, in low marshy situations, wherein the disease raged through the summer, as well as in the spring and autumn of 1777, and proved full as fatal as in the metro∣polis.</P>
<P>When he was consulted at the com∣mencement of the disease, he generally began the cure by an antimonial emetic, given in small and repeated doses till it vomited, by which much bilious fluids were discharged; and as soon as the ope∣ration was over, he did not hesitate to ex∣hibit the bark, either in decoction or in substance, although the fever was then considerable; it seldom appeared to him to increase it, or the dyspnoea which of∣ten attended the angina. Occasionally,
<PB N="42" REF="39"/>however, where the fever was very vio∣lent, he intervened emotic tartar in small doses as a relaxant, and joined neutralized lemon juice with the cortox: when a diarrhaea was alarming, the confectio car∣diaca was added, and small doses of the∣baic tincture; sometimes with rhubarb, or small doses of ipecacoanha instead of the emetie tartar; but throughout the whole progress of the disease the bark was seldom relinquished. Cordial drinks and acidulated liquors formed a part of the diet. He usually prescribed the volatile liniment to the fauces and throat; but where there was danger of suffocation, he applied blisters to the neck. They some∣times appeared to him to have beneficial effects; but he observed, that most of those anginas which terminated in tedious glandular suppurations of the neck, had been previously treated with visicatories; from whence it was suspected, whether the stimulus of the cantharides had not excited this troublesome and dangerous
<PB N="43" REF="40"/>symptom, and thereby rather increased than lessened the danger of suffocation.</P>
<P>He seldom found the delirium and restlessness which accompanied the an∣gina, yielded to an opiate, they were sometimes increased by it, but that pedi∣luvium and fomentations of vinegar and water to the legs produced a more salu∣tary effect; when both were used to∣gether, the opiate usually produced a more salutary effect.</P>
<P>Out of several cases of glandular sup∣purations which have occurred to him in practice, he has favoured me with the following cases and dissection.</P>
<P>Mary Pulling, aged nine years, was attacked on the 13th of May, 1777, with rigors and vomiting, which were suc∣ceeded by fever, and efflorescence of the skin. I first visited her on the 17th; the
<PB N="44" REF="41"/>heat was then excessive, and the efflores∣cence general; the pulse beat about 130 in a minute; a slight cough was occasionally excited, and a delirium now and then prevailed: she complained of a soreness of the throat, which I found to be ul∣cerated.</P>
<P>Cordial remedies were administered, with preparations of the bark. Laxa∣tives were occasionally prescribed, and mild opiates when necessity required. The volatile liniment was applied to the throat and fauces, and gargles were care∣fully used. About the 6th day, a blister was applied behind each ear.</P>
<P>In about ten days time no symptoms of the angina appeared; the fever had sub∣sided, and the efflorescence of the skin had vanished; but the strength was reduced, and the nourishment and drinks which the patient swallowed were discharged by
<PB N="45" REF="42"/>vomiting; at the same time neither a diffi∣culty of breathing nor of swallowing oc∣curred. Opiates did not subdue the vo∣miting; mineral acids had no effect, and laxatives did not divert this by opening another discharge; and even quicksilve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was ejected. The want of nutrition would augment the debility, to obviate which broth clysters were recommended; and to take off the determination to the stomach, a blister was applied to each foot. The vomiting, however, never subsided till the 12th of June, when the emaciated pati∣ent expired, without either previous dys∣pnoea, catarrh, or difficult deglutition.</P>
<P>On the 13th, the patient was opened by Surgeon Vaux, in the presence of Dr. Hulme, and other medical gentlemen.</P>
<P>The brain was found in a perfect state. The intestines also did not appear diseased; the omentum was almost dissipated; what
<PB N="46" REF="43"/>remained of it was flaccid, and not indu∣rated. The gall-bladder was considerably enlarged. On the lest side of the thorax an effusion of water appeared, and the left lobe of the lungs afforded a tubercle of considerable magnitude. The heart was in a healthy state, and so were the liver and stomach.</P>
<P>Upon opening the throat a considerable tumor was found on the right side, im∣mediately behind the <HI>tonsil,</HI> but it had no duct or passage into the trachoea; the tumor contained about three ounces of foetid pus in its cavity. The child con∣tinued sensible through the disease, but for the last fortnight never complained of any affection near the throat; or that the constant inclination to vomit all food or liquids, proceeded from irritation near the part diseased, and deglutition continued fa∣miliar to the exit of the patient.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="44"/>
<P>About the same time I was attending another child with very similar symptoms of the angina trachoealis; the tumor of the neck was however much larger, and a slight dyspnoea attended the child, which increased to such a degree one night as threatened suffocation. On the next day the fever and dyspnoea very sud∣denly diminished; and, upon examining the throat internally, I observed a quan∣tity of pus discharging from behind the <HI>tonsil</HI> of the same side of the neck, and this discharge was augmented by gently pressing the tumor externally. The child from this period gradually recovered.</P>
<P>Suppurations of this kind do not un∣frequently accompany the angina maligna, or appear during its secession, and continue sometimes feveral days after the mucous membrane, which was first affected in the angina, has recovered its natural state. In such instances, wherein a fatal tendency
<PB N="48" REF="45"/>is suspected, would it not be adviseable to open the abscess that is formed, either by an incision through the <HI>tonsil</HI> on the side affected, in imitation of the natural operation which occurred in the last in∣stance, or through the external integu∣ments where the tumor points externally?</P>

<HEAD>On the extremes of the cold and hot regimen in the Sore-Throat, and other putrid Diseases.</HEAD>
<P>SYDENHAM and MORTON practised at one time in London; the former introduced the antiphlogistic, whilst the latter continued the alexipharmic, regimen, in the small-pox as well as in different putrid affections; both perhaps with equal grounds and success, as the practice of the one was mostly in the airy and court part of the town, where all diseases are less malignant, and where the air is purer than it is in the close part of the town, the city, full of gaols and impure air in which the other resided. An observation com∣municated to me by Dr. Fothergill, who insists even now upon the hot regimen in
<PB N="50" REF="47"/>the malignant Sore-Throat, and has assured me that notwithstanding, in compliance with other physicians, he often tried the bark, yet never found it to answer the desired effect and was obliged to have re∣course again to his method of treating it with cordials, &amp;c. He observed further, that even animal food seemed not to be so hurtful in this disease as is commonly thought; for he has taken notice that the patients have a particular longing for it, a call of unerring nature for support and strength, and the Doctor thinks that acids are not so beneficial, and so great an∣tisceptics, as is imagined: all which re∣marks are certainly not theoretical, but founded on the solid basis of a long and great practice and repeated observations; other practitioners however, insist much upon the bark, and some even upon the antiphlogistic regimen.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="48"/>
<P>It is true, that the indications of cure, according to the state of the patient, his situation, and the degree of malignancy of the disease and its symptoms, and not this or that regimen ought to be the guide of the artist. It is also undeniable, that even nature which is so much talked of, cannot always be consulted as the true guide; for if we were to encourage na∣ture in all her endeavours, she would lead us often astray. In many erysipelous cases, and cutaneous eruptions, where nature en∣deavours to throw out some peccant mat∣ter upon the skin, experience has thought not to assist her by sudorifics and warm medicines, but on the contrary to use ca∣thartics. In the putrid Sore-Throat, and the confluent small-pox, the diarrhea often attending, must be checked and moderated; and so in many cases where nature must be opposed, as she often acts not upon wise, but upon mechanical principles,
<PB N="52" REF="49"/>and it is the business of the physician to watch her only, and to let experience be his guide, in encouraging, moderating, and counteracting her efforts; it is only there∣fore practice and not theory that enables the artist to distinguish between the criti∣cal and symptomatical appearances of dis∣eases. But when practitioners differ so widely, even those who practise in one and the same part of the town, and all appeal to facts, then I should think, theory might have some right to interfere, and bring in its verdict. I know that I am far from being equal to the task; nor do I propose to decide in so important and intricate a subject, but mean only to throw out some thoughts, and vehemently wish that the subject might be handled by my superiors both in knowledge and practice.</P>
<P>The antiphlogistic regimen, in the con∣fluent small-pox especially, is hot so mo∣dern
<PB N="53" REF="50"/>as it is commonly thought. The Ara∣bian physicians have already recommended the free and cold air,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Primus est cum nimium tecti et coöperti aegri suffo∣cantur, et in Lipothymiam incidunt, tunc aeri frigido, vento etiam paulatim tamen, aegri exponendi.

Avicen. Fen. 1. Can. 4. Tract 4. Cap. 10.</NOTE> evacuations, and large bleeding, even <HI>ad sincopium.</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Rhazis, C. 5. C. 47.—234.</NOTE> Sydenham has only renewed and intro∣duced it more generally, which regimen, as it was at first so much opposed, so has it afterwards been too much embraced and extended to too great a length, as we are commonly apt to run to either of the extremes, especially when we are actuated
<PB N="54" REF="51"/>by the evil spirits of novelty and contra∣diction.</P>
<P>Though there is a great difference be∣tween the nature of the confluent small-pox and the disease in question, as the latter consists chiefly in the constitution of the air, evidenced by its attacking the <HI>fauces,</HI> whereas the former lies dormant and lurking, as it were, in the system and the whole mass of blood, obvious from the nature of inoculation; yet are they in so far similar, as all putrid diseases, or those which appear with great depression of strength, are related to one another, and therefore what holds of the one, is <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> applicable to the other, as in both, the view of the physician must be directed in supporting the strength of his patient, and in avoiding every application that may in the least tend to increase the general debility. Either of the extremes
<PB N="55" REF="52"/>will often increase the disease; for to confine the patient to his bed, heat his bo∣dy with wine and cordials, and debar him of the air, must certainly rarify the blood, relax the fibres, and increase the ten∣dency to putrefaction, by increasing its too great principles, <HI>heat</HI> and <HI>moisture;</HI> as on the other hand, the too cold regimen will greatly contribute to lessen the energy and motion of the solids as well as of the fluids; and indeed many young and tender patients have perished by cold, and been frozen to death, as it were, though others have often recovered under the coldest regimen, yet this will prove no more than, that nature often cures diseases in spite of all mismanagement of art.</P>
<P>Bleeding can seldom be proper, for the spontaneous nasal hoemorrhage, in the on∣set of both diseases, the putrid Sore-Throat and the confluent small-pox, does not seem
<PB N="56" REF="53"/>to be a hint of nature, insinuating the neces∣sity of emptying the vessels; but I should imagine its being merely symptomatical, owing to the loose texture of the blood, as is evident in cases of great malignancy, where the blood when drawn from a vein is so watery and putrid, that it does not coagulate as usual, and might be divi∣ded and moved any way with the slightest touch of a feather, like water: the air con∣fined in the blood encreases its elasticity is set loose by the heat and fermentation of the fluids, and expands itself to such a degree, that it compasses a much greater room than usual, by which means it stretch∣es the fibres, and forces them to dilate beyond their natural dimensions, which, in the smaller capillary veins, occasions their bursting, and consequently hoe∣morrhages that are only symptomatical and indicate antisceptics, bracers, and free air, not bleeding; though the Arabian Physi∣cians
<PB N="57" REF="54"/>have considered such discharges as critical, and accordingly recommended the opening of the veins of the nose in the be∣ginning of the small-pox.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Et cum erit conveniens flebotomare venas narum i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> principis, est satis utile. Rhazis d'wis. P. 209.</NOTE></P>
<P>The same observation holds of the diarr∣haea, often attending the small-pox, as well as the putrid Sore-Throat, which is symptomatical, owing to the weakness and irritable state of the intestinal tube, and to the stimuli of the juices corrupted by the disease, but is not a critical discharge, and therefore must be moderated.</P>
<P>In all putrid diseases, the principle of life and the nerves are chiefly concerned, insomuch, that Astrue thought, from examining the brains of those who died in putrid fevers, that the seat of the disorder lies originally in the brain itself; but if
<PB N="58" REF="55"/>even that alteration found he in the brain was only (as it most probably seemed to be) the effect and not the cause of the disease, yet has no physician ever disputed that all putrid disorders impart much to the eneaphlon and the nervous system, as is evident from the anxiety, dejection of spirits, and prostration of strength attend∣ing the very onset of putrid diseases, clearly painted upon the eyes, and languishing and pityful countenance of the patient, and which, by itself, is sufficient for a good observer, to give him an exact idea of the disease and its degree of malignancy, with∣out examining the state of the pulse, and inquiring into all other symptoms. Whe∣ther the nerves are primary or secondary affected it matters not, the indications of cure, <HI>coeteris paribus,</HI> remain notwithstand∣ing the same, namely, to excite and rouse the motion and energy of the nerves, and to brace the whole system, which may be
<PB N="59" REF="56"/>done either by applications acting with their stimulating quality, such as cordials, spirits, and blisters, or by administering such as are able to corroborate and com∣pact, as it were, the loose and relaxed fibres, as are all the bitters, the bark, cold air, &amp;c. Either of which applications however are not attended without some disadvantages; for what concerns cordials and stimuli, it is well known, that although they won∣derfully rouse the spirits, yet that great ex∣ertion of the nerves is only a temporary tumult, as it were, which soon ceases, and leaves commonly behind it a great langour and relaxation of the fibres; as on the other hand strengtheners and bitters alone, without the junction of some stimuli to exert the fibres into motion and action, will sometimes have no effect at all, and often do great mischief; for I have else∣where<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See the Author's Essay on the Blood.</NOTE> endeavoured to shew, that all
<PB N="60" REF="57"/>medicines and application to living bodies can act only in degree and proportion to the reaction of the living fibres, and as long as the fibres are too weak to react, the effects of corroborating medicines will be just, to make use of a familiar simile, as a heap of coals thrown upon a little fire, which, instead of making it burn brisker, will extinguish it entirely.</P>
<P>The immediate effects of the bark, when given to patients, whose lungs are affected, in bringing on an insupportable dyspnoea, is a plain proof that it diminishes the irrita∣tion of the fibres, and which I have seen often restored by administering what are called expectorants and stimuli, especially a solution of gum ammoniac, with the sal. c. c. Seeing therefore, that there is some difficulty attending in each of the applica∣tions and regimens separately, the most ra∣tional method, I should imagine, would be
<PB N="61" REF="58"/>to hit upon the medium of both regimens, and to join the bark along with stimulants and cordials, by which means, both inten∣tions might be answered at once, namely, that of rousing the fibres, and exerting them to react, when at the same time they are coroborated and strengthened by the bark; practice convinces the truth of this theory. That the bark doth often not an∣swer the expectations of the physician, is most probably owing to, either of its not being properly guarded with stimula∣ting and warm medicines, or, which I be∣lieve is too often the case, to its not been given in full doses, and not being perseve∣red in, though it must be allowed, that whenever an anginal dyspnoea is at hand, that the bark cannot be administered with∣out bringing on alarming symptoms. But might it not often succeed when joined with balsamics and aromatics?</P>
