<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE three first of the following Cases have already, in some mea∣sure, been communicated to the Publick, through the Candour of the <HI>Learned Gentleman</HI> to whom they are address'd.</P>
<P>It may be seemingly unnecessary therefore perhaps to publish them again: But as there is something in each of them which is very re∣markable, and One of them in particular, seems to clear up a Point of considerable Conse∣quence with respect to <HI>Inoculation,</HI> it cannot be amiss, I think, to give them a Chance at least, of being, if possible, a little more pub∣lick: Besides, there are several Additions to the two last of them since they were sent to the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></P>
<P>Most of the other Cases are taken from some <HI>Adversaria,</HI> or Manuscript Notes, which I have, as well as an Account of several Diseases, both Acute and Chronical, in Manuscript like∣wise,
<PB REF="3"/>of Dr. <HI>Browne</HI>'s, Son of the famous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of the <HI>Religio Medici.</HI><Q>Nec satis est vulgasse Fidem —</Q> but the Author likewise of <HI>Pseudodoxia Epidemica,</HI> and of several other valuable Treatises.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Thomas Browne,</HI> and who was himself likewise a Person of great Learning and Emi∣nence, and <HI>Physician</HI> to St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s <HI>Hospital</HI> for upwards of six and twenty Years, and succeeded therein by Dr. <HI>Cade,</HI> in <HI>October, Anno Domini, 1708.</HI></P>
<P>The first of them was communicated to him by one <HI>R. G.</HI> an <HI>Apothecary</HI> at the <HI>Bath,</HI> and the Minutes of it are said to have been taken from Mr. <HI>Long</HI>'s own Mouth, as may be seen by the said <HI>R. G</HI>'s Letter, dated <HI>July 11, 1692,</HI> and is by no means an inaccurate Relation. The three others, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dormer</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>Hales</HI>'s, and the Marquis of <HI>Dorchester</HI>'s, came directly within his own Observation, and have something in them which is very well worth Notice, as well as that brief Account of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> which is chiefly likewise taken from his Manuscript Papers.</P>
<P>There are but two Cases besides; One of them, of the same kind with That in the first <HI>Letter</HI> to Mr. <HI>Folkes,</HI> tho' not of the same fortunate Event: The other, taken from <HI>Tulpius,</HI> which I hope there is no occasion to make any Apology for, especially considering how apposite it seems to be to some of those Observations, which oc∣curr'd

<HEAD>CASE <HI>the</HI> FIRST. AN ACCOUNT OF A Person who made <HI>Bloody Water</HI> in the Course of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> and yet recover'd: In a LETTER to <HI>MARTIN FOLKES,</HI> Esq; PRESIDENT of the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>AKING Bloody Water is uni∣versally esteem'd as terrible a Symp∣tom as any that can happen in the Small-Pox, and all who have wrote concerning that Distemper do una∣nimously agree, that it is a certain Forerunner of approaching Death. Dr. <HI>Cade</HI> indeed says, in his Letter to Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> concerning Purg∣ing in that Distemper, that he has sometimes cur'd this Symptom by the help of Camphire,
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>and a copious Quantity of Acids; but then he adds, that this Relief was only temporary, and that, to confess the Truth, he never knew any Body that made that sort of Water, who ever surviv'd the 16th Day from the Eruption, and <HI>there is no Body whom I know of,</HI> that has been conversant in this Distemper, but has constantly experienc'd, sooner or later, the like Fatality in consequence of it: I mean, when this sort of Urine has plainly proceeded from a broken Crasis or Contexture, or as it were a thorough Dissolution of the whole Mass of Blood: For I know very well you shall now and then have several Streaks, and sometimes larger Quantities of Blood, in the Urine, from the Acrimony of the Salts that are in <HI>Spanish</HI> Flies, upon the Application of Blisters, which are frequently ordered, and <HI>mostly likewise</HI> ne∣cessary, in one or other of the <HI>Stadia</HI> of this Distemper, and yet the Patient shall do well. And Dr. <HI>Browne,</HI> who was a very worthy Predecessor of mine in St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s Hos∣pital, gives an Account of a Gentlewoman that liv'd in <HI>Dean's Yard, Westminster,</HI> who made bloody Urine in the Small-Pox, for four or five Days together, and that Dr. <HI>Needham,</HI> who attended her <HI>along</HI> with him, did, upon that account, forsake her, and yet she did well; but that they found afterwards, that this bloody Urine was not occasion'd by the Malignancy
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>of the Distemper, but by a sharp Stone which was at that time descending from one of the Kidneys, through the Ureters, into the Blad∣der, and which she afterwards voided. This I have from some <HI>Adversaria</HI> of his, a good number of which I have had the fortune to be in possession of several Years, and among which there are likewise several other re∣markable Cases that occurr'd to him during the course of a very long and extensive, as well as successful Practice.</P>
<P>But to return to my Subject.</P>
<P>It cannot but be a Satisfaction therefore, to a Person of your Humanity and Goodness, to hear of an Instance in which this frightful Symptom was not attended with its usual Fa∣tality; and it was in the Case of a young Gentleman of about 16 Years of Age, Son to one Colonel <HI>Ellitson,</HI> a Gentleman of very considerable Fortune and Worth in <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>He was taken with a Fever and great Pain in his Head on <HI>April</HI> the 20th last, and had the Small-Pox come out upon him the Day fol∣lowing, notwithstanding which the same Symp∣toms still continued, and <HI>nothing almost</HI> would stay in his Stomach, and his Head likewise was very delirious: <HI>He was oblig'd therefore to be</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>blooded, and had Blisters applied to his Neck and to his Arms, which, together with a pro∣per Quantity of <HI>Pulvis e chelis Cancror. comp.</HI> and Nitre, were the first Things that I had an Opportunity of ordering for him.</P>
<P>The next Day every thing was more quiet, and so again the third Day from the Eruption; but the Small-Pox were very numerous all over him, and of a rank angry Sort, as they gene∣rally are, I think, in most of your <HI>West-India</HI> Constitutions; but this young Gentleman had besides overheated himself a little before, upon acting his Part among the rest of his School-Fellows, at the <HI>Montum</HI> near <HI>Eaton.</HI></P>
<P>Things continued in the same State the fourth Day, but towards the Evening there were a few Streaks of Blood mix'd with, and subsiding in his Water, which did not much alarm me, because I did not know but it might be caus'd by the Blisters. I had but one Rea∣son to doubt the contrary, and that was, he had little or no Strangury; but some Persons did assure me that they had known such, or even a more bloody sort of Water occasion'd by Blisters, even tho' there was no Strangury. I was willing therefore to hope the best, and so made no other Alteration in my Process than to direct a plentiful Use of Spirit of Vitriol.</P>
<P>What was order'd happen'd to succeed: We had no more of that sort of Water, either
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>that Night, or the next Day, or the Morning following: But I was sent for in a great hurry that Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the 6th in the Afternoon, and found his Friends in the utmost Consternation, not only because it return'd, but because it began to increase upon them, and was pouring off in a very free manner;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No Notice was taken of this, either to the Society, or in the Account which is given of this Affair in the <HI>Transactions,</HI> the Reasons for which you will see towards the Beginning of the subsequent Letter.</NOTE> a Specimen of which I herewith send you.</P>
<P>It was necessary therefore to proceed in ano∣ther Method, and I accordingly prescrib'd him <HI>Gum. Arabic. Oliban. &amp; Pulv. Amyl. ana</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss. <HI>Alumin. nup. gr.</HI> iv. to be taken <HI>sextis horis,</HI> in 3 or 4 Spoonfuls of a Mixture, <HI>ex Aqua. Cinnamom. ten. Ciras. nigr. ana.</HI> ℥iii. <HI>Theriacal.</HI> ℥iss. <HI>Terr. Japonic.</HI> ʒss. <HI>Tinct. Antiphthisic.</HI> ʒiss. <HI>&amp; Syrup de Mecon.</HI> ℥ss. Which, with <HI>Tinct. Rosar. rubrar.</HI> strongly acidulated with <HI>Spirit of Vitriol,</HI> sweeten'd with the above <HI>Syrup. Aqua Cinnamom. tem. Fort. ana.</HI> ℥ii. to be us'd <HI>ad libit,</HI> had the desired Effect, and the Bloodiness of the Urine began to abate in about 10 or 12 Hours, and in 10 or 12 Hours more to go thoroughly off, so that by the next Day in the Evening the Urine was return'd to its natural State and Colour.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<P>There was nothing farther observable in the course of this Case, except that the Distem∣per was of the Coherent Kind, and according∣ly attended with many other dubious Symp∣toms likewise: For tho' it is generally thought that the Coherent Sort is not so formidable as the Confluent, yet, as Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> has judi∣ciously observ'd, and Dr. <HI>Moreton</HI> before him, there is not so much difference between them, but they are almost always attended with much the same Appearances, and the same Fevers plainly, at the time of Maturation; for that the Danger does not arise so much from the Sort, as from the Number of the Pustules, which if it be great, there is the like Reason to be fearful of the Event, whether they flux, or whether they only cohere: All which not∣withstanding this young Gentleman had the good Fortune to escape.</P>
<P>I have nothing farther to detain you with at present but one short Request, and that is, that you will be so good as to believe me with all the Respect and Esteem imagin∣able,</P>

<HEAD>CASE <HI>the</HI> SECOND <HI>and</HI> THIRD. A SECOND LETTER to <HI>MARTIN FOLKES,</HI>Esq; PRESIDENT of the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In Vindication of the foregoing CASE. Together with Two other very remarkable <HI>Small-Pox</HI> Cases.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter proper">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> DID myself the Pleasure, some time since, to send you an Ac∣count of a young Gentleman who made Bloody Water in the Course of the Small-Pox, and yet recover'd, and you were so obliging as to give it a Place in a subsequent <HI>Transaction.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Thing however which I could wish had not been omitted, and <HI>that</HI> is, that I sent you likewise a Sample of that Wa∣ter,
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>by which you might see whether it was, or was not, of that formidable Sort which I took it to be; but Dr. <HI>Mortimer</HI> tells me, there were several Gentlemen at the Society who had never had the Small-Pox, and that some of them might probably be very much afraid of it, and that it was not therefore thought adviseable that the said Sample shou'd be produc'd, and that it not having been pro∣duc'd before the Society he, through Inadver∣tency, did forget to take any Notice of it in the Publication.</P>
<P>The Case must therefore rest upon the bare Relation, as it does: All that I shall say far∣ther in relation to it is, That it was a more thorough bloody Urine, and in a larger Quantity, than is ever occasion'd by Blisters, and entirely of that kind as seldom ever fails to be fatal: <HI>Et quamvis Remedia proposita sint vulgaria, hic Casus tamen observationem meruit propter Eventum non vulgarem, ex omnibus enim Variolis laborantibus quos mihi totâ vitâ videre contigit, hic unicus fuit qui ex Fluxu sanguineo evaserit, sed in caeteris certum Mortis praesagium fuit, magnâ prae∣sertim sanguinis copiâ affluente;</HI> as <HI>Riverius</HI> had the Good-fortune to be able to say before me, in a parallel Case which came before him, <HI>Centur. primâ Observation:,</HI> — Observat. lxxi. — I call it a parallel Case,
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>tho' This was a <HI>Fluxus Alvei,</HI> because the Prognostick is the same, whether the Effusion of Blood be <HI>per Alveum, vel per Vesicam.</HI></P>
<P>What I have to offer to you now is a Case of a different Nature, but an Instance like∣wise of the Recovery of a Gentleman who had this Distemper in as terrible a manner as can well be conceiv'd, and that by a Regimen altogether as extraordinary.</P>
<P>It was one Mr. <HI>Prouse,</HI> Grandson to the learned and good Dr. <HI>Hooper,</HI> at that time Bishop of <HI>Bath and Wells,</HI> and the present worthy and steady Representative of his Country for the County of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and is taken from a Letter which was sent to a Friend of mine, from one of the nearest Re∣lations that Mr. <HI>Prouse</HI> had, and who was with him during the whole time, <HI>viz.</HI> his Mother, dated <HI>October</HI> 31, 1719.</P>
<P>He had the Small-Pox came out upon him <HI>October</HI> 15, 1719, and on the 17th, <HI>i. e.</HI> the third Day, at Night, was seiz'd with a vio∣lent Shortness of Breath, which increas'd upon him the 18th in the Morning, so that he was in danger of being what they call throttled, had the Hiccups, rattled in his Throat, fetch'd his Breath double, grew senseless, look'd black and blue, was convuls'd all over, and lost one Pulse in four.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
<P>This till Eight at Night, during which time they pour'd in as much Wine, Brandy, and Spirits, as they cou'd, every Quarter of an Hour, but about that time he began to be in such a State as they cou'd not get in any more, and he fell into a sort of Slumber, out of which he wak'd in a very little time, and was something better: So from thence they continued him in the same Course, drinking nothing weaker than Strong Beer, and that with at least two or three Spoonfuls of Brandy, or Spirits, in every Draught of it, once every Hour, to the 27th, or the 13th after the Eruption: And what is very re∣markable, if they let him lie any time an Hour or two extraordinary without these Liquors, he would grow light-headed, hot, and sick, but upon returning to them would grow cool and easy.</P>
<P>The Night between the 27th and the 28th was a very bad one, insomuch that it was as much as three Persons cou'd do to hold him in his Bed, but about Seven in the Morning he came entirely to himself, and was from that time thoroughly out of Danger; but during the Course that he was in before, which was from the 18th to the Morning of the 28th, besides his other Potables, which were all heighten'd and made strong with Drops or Spirits, he drank six and twenty
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>Quarts and one Pint of Liquor, the smallest of which was Strong Beer, and the greatest part the strongest Wine that cou'd be got, besides a full Quart of Brandy.</P>
<P>All this while he did not know that it was the Small-Pox, but fancied it was a Surfeit which he had got by his having eaten too heartily of Pork, and was about 12 Years old when this happen'd.</P>
<P>The Eclat of this Recovery did a great deal of Credit to old Dr. <HI>Bettenson,</HI> under whose Care he was at the <HI>Bath,</HI> who, as he was a very eminent and good Physician, did every thing incumbent upon a Person of Skill and Integrity in a regular manner, previous to these terrible Appearances, but found himself, as he thought then, oblig'd to go a good deal out of the way, in order to support him, if possible, under the Violence of them, and was after∣wards in a manner necessitated to go on with it by what is above related: And his Success in this Case, if I am rightly inform'd, encourag'd him to treat some of his future Small-Pox Pa∣tients, more particularly the present Earl <HI>Pow∣let,</HI> and a Brother or two of his, in much the same manner, and that without any sinister Event; but not being Master of those Cases, I can't say any thing more as to them.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
<P>Give me leave only to remark, That the Gentlemen of that County have, for the most part, good <HI>Stamina,</HI> and that it happens like∣wise very fortunately, especially in Cases of such extreme Danger as that of Mr. <HI>Prouse</HI> was, <HI>ut &amp; sint,</HI> as <HI>Horace</HI> expresses it, <HI>dura Ilia, &amp; ut, quicquid Veneni saeviat in praecor∣diis, Medici sinnt, qui iis auxiliatricem expor∣rigant manum.</HI></P>
<P>I did not think to trouble you with any thing more at present, but another Small-Pox Case being lately come to my Hands, I was not willing to lose the Opportunity of com∣municating it.</P>
<P>It is the Case of a little Boy, Son to Mr. <HI>Richards,</HI> Member of Parliament for <HI>Bridport</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire.</HI> He was inoculated about three Years ago, at the Age of about 3, and had the Small-Pox come out upon him to the number of 50 or 60, and they matura∣ted and scabb'd, and went off in the same manner that that sort of Pock, which was a regular and distinct one, generally does: But about two Years afterwards, <HI>i. e.</HI> about a Year ago, he had the Small-Pox again, and there came out between 2 and 300, which maturated and scabb'd likewise, and went through the same Stages, and in the same manner that the former did, only he was
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>worse before the Eruption, but when that was compleated had no manner of Disorder except too much of an Appetite, as is usual every now and then, in and after the Small-Pox.</P>
<P>This is authenticated to me by a Letter which I have from a learned and experienced Physician in those Parts, Dr. <HI>Brodrepp,</HI> who is likewise Grandfather to the Child, and attended him upon both Occasions: And, whatever may be said in evasion of other Gases, in which Persons that have been inocu∣lated have had the Small-Pox afterwards, as That the Inoculation did not take place, There was no Eruption, at least no Variolous one, and the like, is certainly an Instance that All is not to be depended upon that is given out in favour of, or is expected from Inoculation, and that it is, by no means, an effectual Se∣curity from one's having the Small-Pox again.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">What is between these two <HI>Asterisks,</HI> added now upon the Printing.</NOTE> But, as it has been observed long since by the inimitable Author of <HI>Hudibrass,</HI></P>
<Q><L>Surety the Pleasure is as great</L>

<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
<P>Addresses of this kind likewise ought not to be too long, I shall therefore say no more with relation to this Point at present, but hasten to a Conclusion, for fear that mine should not only be thought, but prove so, and am, with great Respect,</P>

<HEAD><HI>POSTSCRIPT</HI> to the above Letter.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE I wrote this, I have likewise had an Opportunity of being afresh satisfied of what is above related with respect to Mr. <HI>Prouse,</HI> with these further Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That he was at first treated in the same manner that other People usually are, and put into a very temperate, if not too cool a Regimen.</P>
<P>That the Small-Pox, thereupon, did not come on, or rather struck in, and that in consequence thereof, he was brought into the Straits in which he was upon the third and fourth Days.</P>
<P>That, upon this, Dr. <HI>Bettenson</HI> told Mr. <HI>Prouse</HI>'s Relations, of the good Effects which he had sometimes seen from a free Use of Strong and Spirituous Liquors, in his Practice among People in the Country, but did not care to venture upon it in a Person of such tender Years, and of such consequence as Mr. <HI>Prouse</HI> was; but that it was insisted upon that he shou'd do it, it being apparently a de∣sperate Case, and there being nothing else seemingly to be done.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
<P>That they accordingly enter'd upon it, and went on with it, but more frequently than as it is above mention'd, being never able to discontinue the pouring in of them by as much as he cou'd take, for a Quarter of an Hour, without a sensible Detriment to him.</P>
<P>That the Strong Beer which he drank was some that his Grandfather had brewed when he was Dean of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and brought with him from thence, which was then a matter of sixteen Years before, and of the Black or Noggish sort, of near 20 Bushels to the Hogshead.</P>
<P>That the good Event of this Process occa∣sion'd a pretty general Run into a like one, in those Parts, during the time that the Small-Pox was so rife, and of so malignant a Sort, as it was that Winter and the Spring following, and that the Failure of it in some Instances was thought to be owing to too negligent an Attendance to it, or the not plying them duly and sufficiently with such-like Liquors.</P>
<P>And lastly, That it had been generally thought that Mr. <HI>Prouse</HI>'s Cure, extraordinary as it was, could not well be ascrib'd to any thing else, but that <HI>a Physician of the first

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Together with a short Account of the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> in general.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE I wrote the foregoing Let∣ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have met with a Case of the same Nature with the First, in which there was Reason, as I thought, to hope for the same for∣tunate Event, and of which I will likewise give a brief Account, notwithstanding I was disappointed.</P>
<P>It was in a Servant of my own, a Lad of about 19 Years old, who was seiz'd with a <HI>violent Pain in his Back,</HI> which he imputed to his having help'd the Brewer's Servants in carrying down Drink; but which continuing, notwithstanding he was blooded and had a Plaister put upon it, and being attended like∣wise with a Pain in his Head (tho' not a great one) the Day following, I immediately appre∣hended that it was the Forerunner of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> and that of a bad Sort; I say of a
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>bad Sort, because I have scarce ever known that Symptom to have preceded and to persist, but the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> has proved of a very dan∣gerous Sort, and almost constantly fatal: Which is more than I remember to have been observ'd by any body that has hitherto treated concerning this Distemper.</P>
<P>The Eruption ensued, <HI>i. e.</HI> began to shew itself, on the third Day, and <HI>Bloody Water</HI> upon the fourth from that, or the seventh from the Invasion, and continued that and the next Day, and great part of the Day follow∣ing; and there were other Symptoms, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Delirium</HI> and <HI>Diarrhoea, and great Restlesness and Inquietude,</HI> which attended him likewise from just before the Eruption to almost that time, notwithstanding he had been Blooded again, and had a Blister <HI>inter Scapulas,</HI> and taken all proper temperate Restringents the whole while.</P>
<P>What was farther remarkable in this Case is, that he went on pretty tolerably for Num∣ber and Sort, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> after this until the fifteenth Day, but was then seiz'd with a sudden <HI>De∣liquium,</HI> and in such a State that it was almost impracticable to get any thing down, and he was seemingly expiring. They made a shift however to get down, every now and then, a Spoonful or two of <HI>Lac Ammoniac</HI> and <HI>Tinctura Croci,</HI> with some <HI>Serpentaria</HI> in it,
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>and a couple of Blisters were applied <HI>infra Cu∣bitos,</HI> by means of which he came to himself, and was likely enough to live the next Morn∣ing; and continuing so that Day, which was the Sixteenth from the Eruption, and which has been observ'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Case I. Page 2.</NOTE> to be the latest that any One has been known to survive who ever made <HI>such dreadful Water;</HI> and continuing so like∣wise with not much of a Fever, and some∣thing of an Appetite, and two or three Stools a Day, and good Apprehensions for himself, for two Days more, I cannot but think there was Reason to hope he might have done well: But unluckily for him, <HI>the Fever rose upon him</HI> again <HI>the third time,</HI> to a very high degree, the next Day in the Evening, and threw every thing into Confusion, and he died upon the 19th Day of <HI>December</HI> last, having had the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> come out upon him the 30th of the Month before.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>AS I am upon <HI>Small-Pox</HI> Cases, it will not be unacceptable, I hope, if I add some∣thing concerning that Distemper in general, especially as it is partly taken from the <HI>Ad∣versaria</HI> of that <HI>Learned Gentleman</HI> who is mention'd in the Preface, and to whom the Reader will be further oblig'd in most of the subsequent Cases.</P>
<P>The <HI>Small-Pox</HI> is a contagious Distemper, and as terrible as any of them, very many dy∣ing of it, more particularly when it is accom∣panied, as it generally is, with a Fever of a dangerous Kind.</P>
<P>This, when they are many, or of the Flux, or Confluent Sort; on the contrary, when the Patient has but a few, and the Fever ceases upon the Eruption, no Disease is more fa∣vourable, and you may sometimes meet them walking about their Affairs, with the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> in their Faces, in the open Streets of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>No Disease likewise in which there is more of a Crisis than in the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> for by the fourth Day, at furthest, after the Invasion, the Eruption is evident; by the seventh it is per∣fected, or all are come out; by the eleventh they dry away, or turn into Scabs; and by
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>the fourteenth they fall off; tho' in the Flux Sort they are often slower, and some die after the fourteenth, nay on the seventeenth, and twentieth Days, altho' few have Strength enough to hold out so long.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fever,</HI> as has been said, generally joined with the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> and when it ceases not upon the Eruption, apt however for some Days after it to be more remiss: but on the seventh from the Eruption it increases again, and returns with some Violence; and this is what is generally called the <HI>Second Fever,</HI> and occasions the Danger, which continues for some Days: Nay in the Flux Sort some are so un∣fortunate as to have <HI>a third Fever</HI> seven Days after the second, in which Case very few escape.</P>
<P>The <HI>Small-Pox</HI> favourable,</P>

<HEAD>The Fifth Case.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dormer,</HI> who lodg'd then in <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> had a very ill Sort of <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> which ran all together, and covered most of the Superficies of his Skin, both in Face and Body, and was in danger from the Beginning. When the time came that they shou'd dry away, and the <HI>second Fever</HI> increas'd upon him, they stood <HI>like a Quagmire</HI> all about him, and wou'd advance no further, notwith∣standing many powerful Remedies were given
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>him. In this difficult Case <HI>the Doctor</HI> delayed no longer, but gave him <HI>a Drachm of the Bark</HI> in Substance, and repeated it every six Hours at furthest, till he had taken about <HI>an Ounce and an half of it.</HI> His Nights were so bad before, notwithstanding many quieting Remedies which he had taken, that each of them, as it was fear'd, wou'd be his last; but the first Night after he began with the <HI>Bark</HI> was quieter, and the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> on both Sides of his Face began to dry; the second Night his Face was all dried, and some of his Body ad∣vanc'd very much, and after the third Night all the Symptoms abated, and he seem'd to be in great Safety, and very suddenly recover'd to the great Joy of all his numerous Friends.</P>
<P><HI>The Doctor</HI>'s general <HI>Process</HI> as to this Distemper upon other Occasions, much the same as has been ever since, <HI>except as to Bleeding,</HI> which he restrains to a Plethoric Habit, and the Time before the Eruption; tho' at the same time he informs us, that at <HI>Paris</HI> they let them Blood any Day after the Appearance, but says this is not practis'd here in <HI>England; and</HI> excepting likewise <HI>as to Blis∣ters,</HI> which he does not so much as advise the Use of, or make any mention of in the whole Country, or in any State of the Disease, and which I am the more surprized at, because
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>he takes great Notice of them, and advises one at least to be kept continually open and running during the whole course of the ma∣lady, in Malignant and Pestilential Fevers, and says that the great Use of them came first to be known during the <HI>Pestilential Constitution,</HI> which was <HI>Anno</HI> 1664 and 1665, and had continued ever since.</P>
<P>The rest of his Process, <HI>Pectoral Drinks, Lambatives, and Posset-Drink, with Tares</HI> in it in case that the Lungs, and <HI>Gargles and Mucilages</HI> in case that the Throat is affected, together with <HI>Diascordium, Theriaca,</HI> or <HI>Phi∣lonium,</HI> in case of a Looseness, <HI>and an Ounce of Diacodium</HI> every Night in case of Inquie∣tude; and, if the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> prove long last∣ing, some temperate Cordial, and to supply the Spirits often with a Draught of it, in case of Faintness, and <HI>thorough Purging</HI> when the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> is well off, and the Patient fit for it.</P>
<P>There is one thing further which the <HI>Doctor</HI> takes notice of, and that is, that many Waters, Oils and Unguents, or Liniments, are frequently made use of, in order to pre∣serve the Face, after the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> all which he thinks altogether useless, if not hurtful; and that a little Flower, or white Starch, well dried, and shaken upon the Face, is preferable to them all. Nay, if you let no∣thing
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>that is moist, or greasy, touch the Face for fifteen Days, the Face, he says, will scarce be red, at least not so red as it will otherwise be; and if for a long while after you forbear to wash it, it will be the better, and the most that you need to do is to breathe upon a warm Handkerchief, and to wipe your Face with it.</P>

<HEAD>CASE <HI>the</HI> SIXTH. A general Decrepitacy from the <HI>GOUT.</HI> Cur'd by <HI>Bathing,</HI> and <HI>Drinking</HI> of the <HI>Bath-Waters. Anno Domini</HI> 1691 <HI>and</HI> 1692.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>R. <HI>Long,</HI> of <HI>Downeside,</HI> in the <HI>Pa∣rish</HI> of <HI>Shepton Mallet,</HI> in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Somerset,</HI> of about 49 Years of Age, was seiz'd with the Gout about 14 Years before, <HI>i. e.</HI> before the Year 91, and for the three Years immediately preceding, was never without great Pains a Month together in the whole Year, the Pains rambling from Part to Part, and upon Abatement leaving a Numbness over the whole Body. In consequence of this likewise, the <HI>Joints of his Fingers</HI> became <HI>crooked</HI> and inflexible; the <HI>Patella</HI> of his right Knee <HI>fix'd;</HI> his <HI>Posture</HI> decrepit, and <HI>quite double,</HI> with extreme Pain in his Hips and Small of the Back; the <HI>Muscles</HI> and <HI>Joints</HI> of his <HI>Thighs, Legs, Ancles,</HI> and <HI>Feet, motionless,</HI> so that he was carried about from Place to Place, not able to put the least
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>Stress upon the Ground; his Stomach, lost; his thirst, unquenchable; his Face meagre, pale and yellow; the <HI>Hair of his Head, gray,</HI> and <HI>the whole Habit of his Body, emaciated</HI> to Skin and Bones. To these Afflictions were frequently added, <HI>terrible Fits of the Stone,</HI> to which sort of Concretions the En∣trails of his Body were so much dispos'd, that after six Weeks use of the <HI>Bath Waters,</HI> leaving his Waters, by chance, for seven Days, the <HI>Urinal</HI> was <HI>crusted all over</HI> with a perfect hard Stone <HI>like a Pumice,</HI> thicker than a Crown-piece.</P>
<P>This was his Case when he began to drink the <HI>Bath Waters</HI> at the End of <HI>April,</HI> 1691; and he drank them hot in the Morning, and cold at Meals; and in a little time was recon∣ciled to them for his constant Drink, without Desire of any other. In a Week's time his Stomach came, and his Thirst abated; and after a Month's constantly Drinking, and <HI>Bathing every other Day</HI> a little while, only to stretch his Joints, it gave him perfect Ease from Pain.</P>
<P>The 28th of <HI>May</HI> he return'd home, and carried some of the Waters along with him, and sent for them constantly once a Week, using them for his ordinary Drink, and some∣times drinking them warm in the Morning for a Stool or two, as Occasion required, and
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>they pass'd very well, but not so effectually as upon the Place. This Course continued till the End of <HI>August</HI> 1691, when he came to the <HI>Bath</HI> again, Drinking and <HI>Bathing</HI> as at the first, till the Middle of <HI>October,</HI> with increas∣ing Success; but towards that time he went home again, and sent and continued to use the Waters as before.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Allhallowtide</HI> and <HI>Christmas</HI> the Gray Hairs began to fall off, and new ones succeeded; and by <HI>Candlemas</HI> they were all gone, and a brown, curling Hair came in their place, such as he had when he was about 20, growing so fast, that he was oblig'd to cut above an Inch a Month, and still growing thicker and fresher, so that he had a Head of Hair like a Wig, without a gray one in it.</P>
<P>This encourag'd him to quit his own House, and come and take a House at the <HI>Bath,</HI> and to renew and pursue the above Me∣thod very diligently, and it was accordingly attended with daily Amendment, insomuch that in the <HI>Summer,</HI> 1692, <HI>his Toe-Nails,</HI> which before were hard, rugged, and scaly, were thrust off by some that were <HI>new,</HI> fresh, and smooth; his Arms were strengthen'd; his Legs plump'd out, and his Feet cou'd bear a strait pair of Shoes; and he that before cou'd not lay the least Stress upon them, cou'd then
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>bear to stamp upon the Ground, and that forcibly, and without the least Regret, and found his Strength, as he had done his Decay, still increasing upwards, so that he could stand almost upright without any Pain.</P>
<P>He acquired likewise a fleshy Habit of Body, and a ruddy and plump Face, and a lively vigorous Eye, and cou'd bend his Knees, and <HI>did not want other Effects or Powers of Youth:</HI> Nor had he any Fit of the Gout to lay him up, nor the least Touch of the Stone, or any Sharpness of Urine, after he was once well enter'd into drinking of the <HI>Bath-Waters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Case</HI> is related, among a great many others, by Dr. <HI>Peirce</HI> in <HI>his Memoirs of</HI> the <HI>Bath,</HI> Page 334, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but neither so clearly, nor so fully as above; upon which account I take the liberty to publish it, and think that it is so remarkable and <HI>well-told a Case</HI> that it very well deserves the Notice which is taken of it; and there is thus much farther remark∣able in it, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Cure seems to be, in a great measure, owing to the <HI>Bathing,</HI> as well as Drinking of the Waters, tho' it is now thought to be extremely prejudicial, and con∣sequently prohibited to all who are in any man∣ner afflicted with the GOUT.</P>

<P>One Morning, as a Servant of his was pas∣sing through, his Bed-chamber, he call'd to her to reach him the Gallypot in which the <HI>Cordial Electuary</HI> was, out of his Closet, but she through mistake brought him the <HI>Pot of the Extract,</HI> and of which, as it happen'd, there were four Ounces, and he immediately took six Drachms of it, as appear'd upon weighing of what remained afterwards; so that what he took contain'd about <HI>two Scru∣ples and an half, or fifty Grains of</HI> pure <HI>Opium.</HI></P>
<P>After this he slept four Hours, <HI>viz.</HI> from Eight to Twelve, before his Servants perceived any thing of the Mistake, or attempted to wake him; but then they could not, tho' they did what they could, and therefore sent immediately from <HI>Highgate,</HI> where his Lord∣ship then was, to Dr. <HI>Browne</HI> and Sir <HI>John Micklethwaite</HI> to come and attend him.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Micklethwaite</HI> being abroad, Dr. <HI>Browne</HI> prescrib'd divers Things, and had them made up ready, and a little while after∣wards they met with Sir <HI>John,</HI> and by Five
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>in the Evening they were both of them with <HI>my Lord,</HI> at his House in <HI>Highgate.</HI> His Ser∣vants in the mean time had been able to take him up, and put on his Cloaths, and to sup∣port and assist him to walk about his Cham∣ber, and he was sometimes able to open his Eyes, and to answer to what was spoken, but fell asleep again presently, and they were not able to keep him awake a Quarter of a Mi∣nute with all their Striving, calling upon him, <HI>giving him provoking Language,</HI> nor any thing else that they cou'd do.</P>
<P>He was therefore <HI>let Blood</HI> directly, and that plentifully, and then took <HI>Infusion.

Senn.</HI> ℥iv, with <HI>two Ounces of Syrupus de Spinâ,</HI> and repeated the same sort of Me∣dicines every two or three Hours afterwards, and Sir <HI>John Micklethwait</HI> seeing little or no Alteration for the better, return'd to <HI>London</HI> about Nine at Night, bewailing the apparent Loss of so great a Man, so good a Friend, and so kind a Master; but Dr. <HI>Browne</HI> continued with him, and still to give what Assistance he cou'd, and about Midnight order'd <HI>my Lord</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>to be put to Bed, and to be suffered to sleep without those frequent Interruptions which had been hitherto given him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Purging Draughts</HI> continued to work plentifully, and as soon as the Day began to appear, <HI>the Doctor</HI> walk'd down into the Garden to refresh himself with the cool Air of the Morning, giving Orders to be call'd in half an Hour, or upon any Alteration which might happen to his Lordship, and about that time Notice was brought him that <HI>my Lord</HI> seem'd to be more sensible, and was awake; upon which <HI>the Doctor</HI> went in again, and found his Pulse not quite so high as it had been before, and gave him a <HI>Cordial Draught,</HI> with 15 <HI>Drops of Spiritus Salis Armoniaci</HI> in it.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord</HI> being now not so desirous of Sleep as before, call'd for <HI>his Chaplain</HI> to read to him, and in half an Hour more his Head was clear, and he seem'd to be totally reco∣ver'd, and desired to see what had been or∣der'd for him, and spoke of <HI>the Praescriptions</HI> with a great deal of Candour and Reason, and Skill and Judgment. And thus, in the space of less than twenty-four Hours from the Time of the taking it, <HI>the Narcotick,</HI> or whatever <HI>other noxious Quality</HI> there may be in too large a Quantity of <HI>Opium,</HI> was master'd and totally remedied.</P>

Dr. <HI>Browne</HI> visited him from the Beginning of it, and gave him <HI>Glysters</HI> and <HI>Purges,</HI> and order'd him to be <HI>blooded</HI>several times, and as often as he could bear it for the Pain, to go from his Brother's Chambers in the <HI>Temple,</HI> where he lodg'd, as far as to <HI>Hyde-Park</HI> in a Coach: He gave him <HI>Vomits</HI> likewise, especially if ever he began to be drowsy, which frequently happen'd, and they were of <HI>Vitriol. alb. Oxymel of Squills,</HI> and <HI>Vin. Benedictum,</HI> as his <HI>Purges</HI> were of <HI>Decoct. Sennae &amp; Mannae,</HI> with <HI>Syrup of Buckthorn</HI> and <HI>Julep,</HI> and <HI>Resin of Julep,</HI> and <HI>Aloes,</HI> and <HI>Scammony,</HI> which the Doctor gave

<PB N="38" REF="47"/>chiefly because he hop'd they wou'd prove <HI>Hy∣dragogues,</HI> and help to carry off the Serous Parts of the Blood, lest they shou'd otherwise break in upon, and drown the Brain.</P>
<P><HI>These and other Medicines</HI> were <HI>given,</HI> scarce any thing being omitted that cou'd any ways contribute either to the Support of him, or to the suppling of the Passages, or the making a Discharge of the Stone, in all re∣spects, more easy; notwithstanding which there was no Relief, only that he was kept still alive.</P>
<P>At length <HI>the Doctor</HI> thought of <HI>Castile Soap,</HI> and gave him not a little, but from two or three Drachms <HI>to an Ounce,</HI> and <HI>an Ounce and an half,</HI> and to <HI>two and more Ounces</HI> at a time, dissolv'd in Water, 'till he had taken two Pounds of it, and at last there came away <HI>a Stuff,</HI> and some Water followed.—This Stuff was separated, as <HI>the Doctor</HI> imagines, from the Inside of the Ureter, and there came away <HI>a</HI> large <HI>Stone</HI> along with it, and wrapt up in it, besides several other small ones, and Dirt and Skin, and the gangren'd Membrane, <HI>and</HI> after that a <HI>foul and nasty Urine,</HI> and then, <HI>viz.</HI> the next Day in the Morning, a great Quantity of Water.—What he took afterwards was <HI>Terebinthina Veneta,</HI> and other soft and gentle Medicines of the same Tendency, and all was well.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
<P>This is a remarkable Account of a very happy Effect from the Use of <HI>Soap,</HI> and an Instance how free it may be made with, even to a Degree which is almost incredible. But then it must be consider'd, that <HI>this</HI> was like∣wise <HI>an almost gone Case,</HI> and of extreme Exigence: Every thing else, in a manner, had been tried, and there was no other Chance for his Survival. In which sort of Cases it is not only the Judgment, but warrantable, to give things of the greatest Efficacy, and that, not only in the common trifling Way and Doses, but to the utmost Stretch that either the Pa∣tient can bear, or the Medicine shall be found not to be going beyond the <HI>anceps Remedium.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be observed likewise, that the Effect which this Medicine had, was merely to bring away the Stuff, Stone, <HI>&amp;c. Soap,</HI> more particularly that of <HI>Castile,</HI> being, as Dr. <HI>Browne</HI> (immediately previous to this Case) has ob∣serv'd, an <HI>excellent Diuretick;</HI> the Subtilty of its Parts, and <HI>the Activity and Asperity of its Salts, soften'd</HI> by means of their Union <HI>with an Oil,</HI> admirably qualifying it to stimulate and deterge, as well as to relax the Urinary Passages, and consequently to facilitate the Ex∣clusion of any thing that wants to pass off that way.</P>
<P>How far it is capable of being improv'd in∣to further Excellencies, and to become a <HI>Li∣thontriptick,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>or possess'd of the Virtue to break or dissolve the Stone in a human Body, I won't pretend to determine. Dr. <HI>Browne,</HI> tho' he has mention'd several things which are thought to be so, does not seem to think that any thing is really so, or much to be relied upon for any such Purpose: And <HI>Tul∣pius,</HI> that <HI>faithful Observer,</HI> says, <Q>"<HI>Nihil Me∣dicis frequentius in ore quam Medicamen∣tum Calculos frangens; at vide fis arenosos &amp; molles duntaxat intelligas; Silices quippè ut vix comminuunt Mallei, sic profectò mul∣tò minus acris aliquis humor, qui fortassis aptior foret exedendis tenuibus Vesicae tuni∣cis quam praeduris Lapidibus.</HI>"</Q>—Vide <HI>Tul∣pii Observationes, Lib. IV. Cap.</HI> 37. The rest of which, because it is not altogether foreign to the present Purpose, I shall take the liberty to subjoin immediately after <HI>the present Case.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But I forget</HI> — <HI>Physick</HI> is <HI>an ample Field,</HI> and there ever have been, and ever will be Opportunities of adding to, <HI>or retrenching from,</HI> and making some Improvements or Al∣terations or other in Medicine; and there have ever likewise been some who have been <HI>Dis∣creet enough to reserve</HI> the Pleasure of <HI>the Knowledge of them to themselves,</HI> altho' at the same time they have never fail'd to be so <HI>Publick-spirited</HI> as to acquaint the World, of

De hisce, quibus signis hoc anno se prodiderint, et cui demum medendi methodo libentius cefferint, pauca sigillatim dicere liceat.</P>
<P><HI>Febris ea,</HI> de qua jam loquuturi sumus, erat continua quidem, ferè tamen interdiu remittens, et ad stationariam quam annis 1685, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> adumbravit <HI>Sydenhamus,</HI> proxime visa est accedere; nisi quod in illâ frigus calorem per vices excesserit, in hac potius calor se remittere dicatur. Increbuit potis∣simum ineunte <HI>Julio;</HI> nescio an in causâ fuerit ille qui paulò ante saevierit calor. Ac∣cessio morbi subitò et atrox. Praeter vulga∣ria symptomata, uti sitim, inquietudinem,

Aliquando levi horrore in∣gruebat <HI>Febris:</HI> Quando ad statum pervene∣rat, <HI>Dyspnocam, Tendinum subsultus, Deli∣rium,</HI> et mortem denique fere femper intu∣lit, nisi arte tempestive coercita. Per totum morbi decursum, qui nunquam vel spontè vel Medicinâ, ante diem xiv<SUP>tum</SUP> evanuit, Pulsus per se, celer, parvus, inaequalis, ali∣quando et intermittens; Urina coloris satura∣tissimi, nec tamen unquam turbata.

Nonnulli, cum cessasse penitus videretur Febris dies iv. vel v. sine dolore aut aegritudine licet imbecilli ja∣cuerunt,
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>deinde Spasmis repente obortis bre∣vi expirabant. Atque hoc quidem neglectis Vesicatoriis plerumque obtigit: Nullum ve∣rò certius mortis indicium quam <HI>Lingua as∣pera, et colore ferrugineo tincta.</HI> Conva∣lescentibus aliquando supervenit <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> quae tamen perrarò, nisi interveniente Dysen∣teriâ, in deterius terminata est. Aliis vires perquam aegerrimè redierunt, praecipuè Phle∣gmaticis, quibus etiam diutius incubuit mor∣bus. In perpaucis <HI>Parotides,</HI> aut <HI>Bubones</HI> circa inguem orti, Febrem judicabant; quae quidem, quantum advertere licebat, <HI>unica</HI> erat <HI>Criseos species</HI> quae purè <HI>naturalis</HI> dici potuit: sed ne hoc quidem, nisi, Evacuanti∣bus parciùs adhibitis, accidere solebat. Fuit etiam, licet rarissime, per sudores arte elici∣tos morbi solutio; Alia omninò, nisi morte, <HI>Crisis</HI> abfuit. Venâ pertusâ satis magna seri copia reperta est; quae fere dicto citius à cae∣tero sanguine discessit, ita ut inde humorum Dyserasiam facile colligeres.</P>
<P>Sanguine ad hunc modum constituto, et in motus febriles incitato, non fortasse arduum esset Symptomatum rationem exponere; sed hoc et meo instituto, quod in Praxi potissi∣mùm versatur, et tibi qui omnem illam Scien∣tiam animo complecteris, prorsus supervaca∣neum:

<P>Cum jam consisteret <HI>Febris, Vesicatoria</HI> haud inconsultè visa sunt applicari, ne <HI>Spasmo</HI> vel <HI>Phrenitidi</HI> locus pateret; certè alterutro inguente, nulla ferè sine <HI>Vesticatoriis</HI> salutis spes: Ita ut haec necessarii usus fuerint, sive occurrendi malo, sive medendi gratiâ. Nam humores non modò à Capite et Praecordiis revellunt, sed ita digerunt et disponunt ut pacatior fiat Circuitus, et facilior per poros expiratio; Hinc pulsum vividiorem simul et magis aequabilem reddunt. Quod si nec iis cesserit <HI>Delirium,</HI> incidenda est <HI>Jugularis</HI> ad duas vel tres vices si opus fuerit; mira quippè praestat hac in re <HI>Venae</HI> istius <HI>apertio,</HI> neque

<P>De <HI>Cardiacis et Diaphoreticis</HI> non est quod multa dicam, nam ea frequentius nocere com∣peri.

Alias, et calorem exacerbare et Deliria redin∣tegrare magis quam compescere solebant. Quod quidem humoribus sic constitutis, cum <HI>Opii naturâ</HI> minime disconvenit.</P>
<P>Quoniam semper interdiu remiserit <HI>Febris,</HI> exspedtabis fortè hic aliquam de <HI>Peruviano Cortice</HI> mentionem; nam iste in <HI>Angliâ,</HI> con∣tinuis etiam Febribus, modo &amp;c. per vices re∣mittant, satis feliciter medetur. Sed hic spem fefellit exitus: quippe remedium illud nun∣quam adhibitum esse memini, quin ilico re∣crudesceret Febris.</P>
<P>De <HI>Remediis Absorbentibus</HI> et <HI>Testaceis</HI> hoc mihi verè videor dicturus, quod nec iis omissis
