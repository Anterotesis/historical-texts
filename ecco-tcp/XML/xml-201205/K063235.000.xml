<PB REF="4"/>as much as my own Resolution never to publish this <HI>Treatise,</HI> with∣out having the Honour of Prefixing your <HI>Name</HI> to it. Now, as you had done me the Signal Favour to employ me in your own <HI>Family,</HI> about an Affair of this <HI>Malignant Nature,</HI> I thought you would not take it ill of me to acknowledge it in <HI>Print;</HI> but rather candidly interpret it as a Piece of <HI>Gratitude</HI> for your countenancing my <HI>Practice.</HI> And if I have succeed∣ed so far or so well hitherto in what I privately undertook, as to deserve your <HI>Good Word</HI> and <HI>Publick Re∣commendation</HI> of my <HI>Endea∣vours,</HI> as you lately did to the Duke of <HI>L—ds</HI> and some <HI>others:</HI> I hope, you will yet also further vouchsafe to
<PB REF="5"/>grant me your <HI>Patronage</HI> to this small <HI>Tract</HI> of the <HI>KING'S EVIL,</HI> which I design'd purely for the Com∣mon Benefit of the World.</P>

<P>The <HI>Treatise,</HI> I believe, will prove, as I intended it, without Osten∣tation, of General Ʋse and Singular Service to all Persons that are afflicted with <HI>Scrofulous Diseases</HI> them∣selves, or that have either Children or Friends labouring under the <HI>same</HI> in their <HI>Families.</HI> For what can be more valuable than <HI>Health;</HI> without which, all other Enjoyments are so insipid?

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING for many Years last past, advertis'd the World of an extraordinary <HI>Secret</HI> in <HI>Physick,</HI> design'd both by Na∣ture and Art for the Publick Good; and propos'd as often likewise, not only to re∣lieve, but also perfectly cure all Persons whatsoever afflicted with any <HI>Scrophulous Diseases, Strumous Tumors,</HI> or <HI>Malig∣nant Ulcers;</HI> either in the <HI>Glands,</HI> or any other parts of the Body, which are commonly call'd the <HI>KING's EVIL:</HI> I thought I could not do better now, after repeated <HI>Suc∣cesses,</HI>
<PB REF="10"/>than publish a rational <HI>Discourse</HI> of this kind, exemplify'd by many Experimental <HI>Cures;</HI> as well to justify my own <HI>Pretensi∣ons</HI> and <HI>Knowledge</HI> against common Preju∣dice or vulgar Incredulity, as to satisfy other People either about my Care, Method, or Abi∣lity, and to convince 'em at last of the Truth of it by <HI>Matter of Fact.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Discourse</HI> then is not usher'd into the World with a <HI>Bravado,</HI> either to offend or affront other excellent <HI>Practicers</HI> in their way, tho' perhaps often <HI>Unsuccessful;</HI> but on∣ly, with a modest Confidence, and without much boasting of an incomparable <HI>NOSTRUM,</HI> to aver, that for Eighteen Years already past, I have cur'd great Numbers of <HI>Men, Wo∣men,</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> who had been sorely afflicted a long time with this difficult <HI>Distem∣per,</HI> and almost (if not altogether) despair'd of by many eminent <HI>Surgeons:</HI> as will evi∣dently appear by the <HI>Names</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> of A∣bode of the several <HI>Patients</HI> hereafter mention'd in the Conclusion of this <HI>Book.</HI></P>
<PB REF="11"/>
<P>Now the <HI>Reason</HI> of the Thing being plain∣ly made out here, I think there is no denying of <HI>Experience</HI> or <HI>Skill</HI> in the Affair of this <HI>Disease;</HI> without winking (as it were) at the <HI>Sun,</HI> to dispute its shining. But how should such <HI>unlicens'd</HI> or <HI>illiterate Empericks,</HI> that know either little of <HI>Physick</HI> or nothing at all of <HI>Chirugery,</HI> and yet pretend to cure so unaccountable a <HI>Malady</HI> with <HI>Old Wives Medicines,</HI> or worse; how should they (I say) ever do any Good upon't? This is what I do not understand, and wonder at; why they should either he fondly employ'd by some credu∣lous People, or should forwardly undertake such <HI>Impossibilities</HI> themselves; being both beyond their <HI>Reach</HI> as to <HI>manual Operation,</HI> and above the <HI>Sphere</HI> of their Knowledge as to <HI>Internal Medicines.</HI></P>
<P>The Blessing of GOD indeed will go a great way in these desperate <HI>Cases,</HI> and without it, all is but <HI>Labour in vain</HI> at the best; let Man's <HI>Endeavours</HI> be never so great, or their
<PB REF="12"/><HI>Medicines</HI> never so good: But then, who should find out better ordinary <HI>Means</HI> of <HI>Cure,</HI> or take more proper <HI>Methods</HI> for't, than some old able experienc'd <HI>Professor</HI> or other of the Art? As for my Self, far be it from Me to pre∣tend to more than I can perform, and have often accomplish'd with undeniable Success. How∣ever, <HI>Divines</HI> do not use to work <HI>Miracles</HI> now a-days; neither can they cure the <HI>KING's EVIL,</HI> I believe, by Virtue either of their <HI>Function, Sanctity,</HI> or <HI>Blessing.</HI> 'Tis cer∣tainly either a <HI>Physician's</HI> or a <HI>Surgeon's</HI> Bu∣siness, without making <HI>Ill Work</HI> on't. In short, setting aside any other Formality of prefacing or vanity of Conceit as to my <HI>Pretension,</HI> I can only say this modestly; That the <HI>Hall</HI> hath long since authoriz'd my <HI>Practice</HI> by a <HI>DI∣PLOMA,</HI> besides the <HI>License</HI> I have from <HI>Doctors Commons;</HI> and I hope the <HI>Read∣er</HI> as well as my <HI>Brother Surgeons,</HI> will now also approve on't, for the Benefit of Man∣kind.</P>
<P>However, I hope, I may have leave to
<PB REF="13"/>say this by the By further, that thro' the whole <HI>Work,</HI> I have industriously avoided all the <HI>Hard Terms of Art,</HI> that I could possibly o∣mit, in order to make it the more Obvious and Useful to the meanest <HI>Capacity</HI> among my <HI>Readers.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>'<SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>IS well known, that many <HI>Authors</HI> of great <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> have written particular <HI>Treatises</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>E∣vil,</HI> with no less Applause to <HI>Themselves</HI> than Instruction to <HI>Others;</HI> highly <HI>Ʋse∣ful</HI> in all Respects towards finding out an infallible <HI>Remedy</HI> for the eradicating and curing of so growing and so grie∣vous a <HI>Disease,</HI> beyond <HI>Relapse.</HI> 'Tis
<PB N="2" REF="18"/>also to be confess'd that they have not fail'd sometimes of good <HI>Success,</HI> or of working great <HI>Cures</HI> in this <HI>Case:</HI> But whether by <HI>specifick Applications,</HI> by <HI>Ac∣cident,</HI> by <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Blessing,</HI> by the <HI>Royal Touch,</HI> or any other <HI>Arcanum;</HI> is not so easie for me to distinguish and de∣termine. However, I am positive, and it must be granted on the <HI>other hand,</HI> that the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil</HI> has often been left off, by very many judicious <HI>Professors</HI> both of <HI>Physick</HI> and <HI>Chirurgery,</HI> as a Thing <HI>incurable</HI> in several of their lan∣guishing <HI>Patients;</HI> for although I do not look upon it to be the <HI>Ludibrium Medicorum,</HI> yet they have always found it, a very perplexing and puzzling <HI>Dis∣temper.</HI> And therefore, though I shall not vaunt my self like the vain <HI>Philoso∣pher</HI> with an <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that I have found out the Difficulty of all <HI>Diseases,</HI> or some Wonder or other of an <HI>Ʋniversal Medicine:</HI> Yet I have good Reason to persuade my self, both by <HI>Practice</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> that I long ago found a Faithful <HI>Friend;</HI> who <HI>cur'd Me</HI> effectu∣ally of an inveterate <HI>Scrofula,</HI> in spite of all popular Discouragements; and that I my self have also perfectly <HI>cur'd</HI> a

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>The</HI> NAME</HEAD>
<P><HI>FIrst</HI> then; the <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>Disease</HI> in the <HI>Greek,</HI> is either <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, according to <HI>Hesychius.</HI> The <HI>First</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] signifies a <HI>Sow</HI> or a <HI>Hog;</HI> as I sup∣pose those <HI>Creatures</HI> have been thought by the <HI>Ancients,</HI> and are still reckon'd by some <HI>Moderns</HI> to be infested in a more peculiar manner with this <HI>scrofu∣lous Disease:</HI> For in the Throats of <HI>Swine,</HI> we may often find such <HI>strumous Tumors,</HI> and the <HI>Glandules</HI> indurated. And 'tis no wonder neither that <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Brutes</HI> should sometimes be trou∣bled with the <HI>same Distemper;</HI> especially seeing they both agree in many other things of <HI>Constitution</HI> or <HI>Humour.</HI> Or else the <HI>Word</HI> signifies a <HI>Rock</HI> lying with a <HI>Ridge</HI> upon the top of the Sea, not much unlike a <HI>Hog</HI>'s <HI>Back;</HI> and <HI>this</HI> may bear some <HI>Analogy</HI> also to a <HI>Glandulous Tumor:</HI> Whether the <HI>Metaphor</HI> be fetch'd either from the <HI>Hardness,</HI> the <HI>Greatness,</HI> or the <HI>Figure</HI> sometimes of the <HI>Part</HI> afflicted.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="21"/>
<P>The other <HI>Name</HI> of it in the <HI>Greek Tongue</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] imports a dry, arid or inflam'd <HI>Malignancy;</HI> and, as if it were <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Torrid,</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>uro,</HI> to burn. Now a hot, scurfy or friable <HI>Inflammation</HI> represents the Thing very properly to the <HI>Eye,</HI> and expresses the <HI>Nature</HI> of it exactly (as it often happens) to the very <HI>Life.</HI> But my Author <HI>Hesychius</HI> also says, it is likewise a <HI>Disease of Bees,</HI> and explains himself by this particular <HI>Observation;</HI> that <HI>They</HI> are troubled with it at the same time, when they <HI>breed Worms or make Cob-webs.</HI> However, be it as it will as to that matter, this <HI>Word</HI> shews the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Malady well enough in one <HI>Respect</HI> by <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Friability;</HI> though it does not answer yet for all the other <HI>Qualities</HI> of the whole <HI>Evil.</HI></P>
<P>But besides, it has also <HI>Two Names</HI> in the <HI>Latin Tongue;</HI> for the <HI>Gramma∣rians</HI> call it either by That of <HI>Scrofula,</HI> or <HI>That</HI> of <HI>Struma,</HI> indifferently, without any great <HI>Distinction:</HI> only that the <HI>Former</HI> is a diminutive <HI>Word,</HI> signifying a <HI>Wen</HI> in the Throat as well as a <HI>Little
<PB N="6" REF="22"/>Pig,</HI> from <HI>Scrofa</HI> an <HI>Old Sow;</HI> which seems to be a fictitious <HI>Name</HI> of that Creature, taken from the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (as <HI>Hesychius</HI> thinks) perhaps as delighting to grub up the Earth in <HI>Holes</HI> or <HI>Hillocks;</HI> and <HI>These</HI> indeed are <HI>Both</HI> sometimes very apt <HI>De∣nominations</HI> or near <HI>Resemblances</HI> at least of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil,</HI> by reason either of perforating <HI>Ʋlcers</HI> in <HI>one Respect,</HI> or ex∣ceeding large <HI>Tumors</HI> in the <HI>Other.</HI> But the <HI>Latter Word Struma</HI> differs a little from the <HI>Former;</HI> for it is derived from <HI>Ruma,</HI> a <HI>Teat</HI> or <HI>Dug,</HI> &amp;c. which may be <HI>suck'd:</HI> either from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>traho</HI> or <HI>sugo</HI> to suck; or from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>fluo</HI> to <HI>flow,</HI> as the <HI>Milk</HI> does in sucking; which holds some <HI>Analogy</HI> with the <HI>Curdling Matter</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil,</HI> like <HI>Cheese.</HI> And so the <HI>Grammarians</HI> say well, that <HI>Struma</HI> is as it were <HI>struens Rumam,</HI> making a <HI>Dug</HI> or <HI>Pap,</HI> because it rises up frequent∣ly in a <HI>Bump</HI> of that <HI>Shape</HI> or <HI>Figure;</HI> so that, in short, <HI>Struma</HI> is suppos'd to signifie in general any <HI>Tumor, Botch</HI> or <HI>Wen,</HI> either in the <HI>Throat, Neck</HI> or <HI>Arm-holes;</HI> the Word coming imme∣diately (as some think) from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which arises from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>sterno,</HI> to spread; be∣cause
<PB N="7" REF="23"/>the <HI>Disease</HI> might probably be observ'd formerly to <HI>lie</HI> and <HI>spread</HI> most under the <HI>Throat.</HI> And therefore by the same <HI>Analogical Reason,</HI> this <HI>Term</HI> may likewise very properly import, what we now call the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil.</HI></P>
<P>Now I must needs say, that <HI>Either</HI> or <HI>Any</HI> of these Words express the Thing very well as to the main Import of a <HI>scrofulous</HI> or <HI>strumous Tumor;</HI> and do not only give us some <HI>Light</HI> into the <HI>Nature</HI> of it, but also lead us in course to consi∣der the <HI>Disease</HI> more essentially and fully than can be made out, by any nominal <HI>Disquisition</HI> or <HI>Etymology.</HI> But I beg leave here to make one <HI>Digression</HI> by the way, about our <HI>English</HI> Term for the <HI>Struma</HI> or <HI>Scrofula,</HI> as it is now common∣ly call'd the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil</HI> in every Body's Mouth; before I begin to <HI>define</HI> what I have hitherto been only a describing by <HI>Name.</HI> And some <HI>Writers</HI> think that this <HI>Name</HI> was given to any <HI>scrofulous</HI> or <HI>strumous Disease,</HI> long before <HI>Edward the Confessor</HI>'s Time; but however All agree at least, that from his Reign it was call'd nothing else <HI>generally</HI> (and I may say <HI>vulgarly</HI> too) but the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="24"/>in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Reason</HI> for so calling it is <HI>Plain;</HI> whether we believe the <HI>mira∣culous Cure</HI> of that Distemper in many Cases, to be an extraordinary <HI>Blessing</HI> of <HI>God</HI> bestow'd upon the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>England, ab origine,</HI> and so to continue as a powerful Faculty by <HI>hereditary</HI> Successi∣on attending on the <HI>Crown:</HI> or whether we take this <HI>Cure of the Evil</HI> by the <HI>Royal Touch</HI> to have been no <HI>Antienter</HI> than <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor,</HI> and that it was a peculiar <HI>Gift</HI> to <HI>Him</HI> at first, and to <HI>no</HI> Body before <HI>Him,</HI> as a singular <HI>Reward</HI> of his <HI>Holiness;</HI> to be by a kind of <HI>here∣ditary Right</HI> annex'd to <HI>Regal</HI> Authority for the future. The Matter is in <HI>Dispute</HI> still. But be it as it will, the <HI>History</HI> affords us ample <HI>Testimony</HI> and great <HI>Au∣thority</HI> for calling this <HI>Disease</HI> by a <HI>Royal</HI> Name, <HI>The King</HI>'s <HI>Evil;</HI> For, because it cannot be deny'd, but that wonderful <HI>Cures</HI> of it have been formerly wrought, by the Good <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Queens</HI> ox <HI>En∣gland,</HI> and are still <HI>done</HI> by a continu'd <HI>Series</HI> even to this very Day: Not that I believe, <HI>They</HI> ever were, or perhaps ever may be troubled with the <HI>Distem∣per</HI> themselves; as the <HI>Vulgar</HI> in some <HI>Countries</HI> think at the first hearing of
<PB N="9" REF="25"/>the <HI>Name.</HI> However, it must be grant∣ed on the other hand, that several Persons have never been the <HI>better</HI> for being <HI>Touch'd,</HI> nor ever receiv'd any greater <HI>Benefit</HI> by <HI>this Means</HI> than the <HI>Gold</HI> that was given 'em upon their Application; and yet it is certain <HI>They</HI> have afterwards been perfectly <HI>cur'd</HI> of the same Maladies, by the successful <HI>Medicines</HI> of good <HI>Artists:</HI> so that though <HI>Chirurgery</HI> may perhaps fail sometimes, where the <HI>Royal Hand</HI> performs the <HI>Cure;</HI> yet it has held as <HI>true</HI> also on the <HI>contra∣ry,</HI> in Favour of the <HI>other Side,</HI> by many singular Instances.</P>
<P>Wherefore I hope, I may without any <HI>Offence</HI> either to the <HI>Court,</HI> the <HI>City,</HI> or the <HI>Countrey,</HI> either to <HI>Princes</HI> or <HI>Professors,</HI> take upon me to say, and <HI>that</HI> by long <HI>Experience</HI> too, for the publick Good; that let this <HI>Disease</HI> prove never so <HI>In∣veterate</HI> or <HI>Obstinate,</HI> I am possess'd of such Sovereign and Effectual <HI>Medicines</HI> as will <HI>cure</HI> it perfectly by <HI>God</HI>'s Bles∣sing, when all other <HI>Measures</HI> or <HI>Methods</HI> fail.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II <HI>The</HI> Nature <HI>of the</HI> EVIL.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SEcondly;</HI> As to this <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil,</HI> several <HI>Authors</HI> have de∣fin'd it several ways: but the best <HI>Defi∣nition</HI> that I can pretend to gather from 'em all, is <HI>This</HI> in brief. The <HI>Scrofula,</HI> is <HI>a praeternatural malignant Tumor or Hu∣mour, produc'd by a particular Acidity of the Serum of the Blood:</HI> either in <HI>Gland, Muscle</HI> or <HI>Membrane,</HI> which it both <HI>co∣agulates</HI> and <HI>indurates;</HI> or in the <HI>Marrow,</HI> which it always <HI>dissolves,</HI> and also <HI>pu∣trefies</HI> the <HI>Bone.</HI> But lest this <HI>Definition</HI> should want any further <HI>Illustration,</HI> I shall explain my self thus more at large, in a particular manner: Now 'tis plain, this Acidity in the <HI>Serum of the Blood,</HI> must needs occasion a very <HI>Crass, Glu∣tinous</HI> and <HI>Acid Lympha</HI> in the Body; which not finding any convenient or regular <HI>Passage</HI> thro' its proper <HI>Channels,</HI> presently stops in the <HI>Glands</HI> or <HI>Else∣where,</HI> and sensibly <HI>tumefies</HI> or <HI>indurates</HI> the Parts affected: So that, in short,
<PB N="11" REF="27"/>by reason of this <HI>Corrosive Quality,</HI> the Distemper in time becomes Malignant, obdurate and very difficult to be <HI>cured;</HI> the <HI>Lympha</HI> being so <HI>viscous</HI> and so strongly settled in some extreme <HI>Parts,</HI> that it often proves the hardest thing in the World to <HI>thin, rarifie</HI> and <HI>attenuate,</HI> or take away such an <HI>Obstruction,</HI> of <HI>sour, stagnating, coagulated Juices.</HI> From hence it appears, that the <HI>Acid Matter</HI> whe∣ther contain'd <HI>within</HI> a Cystis, or Swel∣ling elsewhere <HI>without,</HI> either in the <HI>Salivatory Glands,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>One</HI> Respect, or in thick <HI>Ʋpper Lips</HI> chopt &amp;c. in the <HI>Other;</HI> is the only Thing to be recti∣fy'd or sweeten'd, in Order to effect a <HI>perfect Cure:</HI> And I cannot conceive how <HI>that</HI> can be done <HI>radically,</HI> save only by <HI>Alcalious Medicines,</HI> which is the <HI>Nostrum</HI> pretended to in my <HI>Pra∣ctice:</HI> For otherwise the latent, habi∣tual and inveterate <HI>Corrosiveness</HI> of the sharp indurated <HI>Lympha,</HI> which is the principal <HI>Cause</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil,</HI> will continually prove <HI>Incorrigible</HI> by all the <HI>Art of Man.</HI> And therefore the <HI>Struma</HI> being a <HI>Disease</HI> of that <HI>rank</HI> and <HI>sour Nature,</HI> it must be corrected and dul∣cify'd by sweet healing <HI>Medicines,</HI> as
<PB N="12" REF="28"/>the most Powerful <HI>Means</HI> to bring the <HI>Acid Humours</HI> or <HI>Juices</HI> to their due <HI>Tone,</HI> as well as the <HI>Constitution</HI> to it's pristine or natural State of <HI>Health</HI> and Vigour.</P>
<P>But to give a more exact <HI>Account</HI> of the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Thing already <HI>de∣fin'd,</HI> I think my self oblig'd to explain the true Meaning of the <HI>Terms, Coagu∣lation</HI> and <HI>Dissolution,</HI> in this Place, as pat to the Purpose. Now by <HI>Coagula∣tion,</HI> I mean an irregular <HI>Curd-ling</HI> or <HI>Thick'ning</HI> of the Blood by a real Priva∣tion of <HI>Moisture;</HI> so that I can com∣pare it to nothing but that of making a <HI>Curd</HI> of Milk with <HI>Rennet.</HI> Now it is notorious that many <HI>strumous Tumors,</HI> being full of a white <HI>curled Matter,</HI> have a <HI>Likeness</HI> at least, if not also an <HI>Affinity</HI> with the <HI>Curd</HI> of Milk; which are <HI>Both</HI> alike occasion'd by a <HI>coagulating Acidity,</HI> though perhaps of a <HI>different Nature:</HI> and yet they must be <HI>Both</HI> very near as <HI>acrimonious</HI> as <HI>Aqua fortis</HI> or <HI>Spi∣rit of Vitriol,</HI> to turn either the fibrous Parts of <HI>Blood</HI> or the gross Particles of <HI>Milk</HI> into a kind of <HI>Cheese</HI> or <HI>curdled Matter</HI> by a coagulating <HI>Fermentation.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="29"/>To confirm this Notion, it will be suf∣ficient to appeal to many <HI>Patients,</HI> whe∣ther they are not often sensible of the most painful <HI>Corrosions,</HI> next to the <HI>gnawing of Dogs;</HI> which must needs pro∣ceed from a sort of a sharp <HI>vitriolick Acidity,</HI> that <HI>stops, coagulates</HI> and <HI>cor∣rodes</HI> the Part so affected, or indeed ra∣ther afflicted, with this Malady.</P>
<P>But on the <HI>other hand;</HI> the <HI>Reason</HI> why I ascribe <HI>Dissolution</HI> to the same <HI>Acidity,</HI> is <HI>this:</HI> Because whenever it comes to the <HI>Marrow,</HI> and mixes with the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the <HI>Bone,</HI> it <HI>dissolves</HI> and rots 'em in all Persons; for every Body knows that <HI>One</HI> and the <HI>same Cause</HI> may have different <HI>Effects,</HI> according to the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Subject Matter</HI> that is wrought upon; for it is a true <HI>Maxim,</HI> that <HI>Whatever is received, is receiv'd accord∣ing to the Quality or Nature of the Receiver;</HI> As for Instance, the <HI>Sun</HI> melts <HI>Butter</HI> and hardens <HI>Clay;</HI> and <HI>Vinegar</HI> coagulates <HI>Milk,</HI> but dissolves an <HI>Egg,</HI> White and Shell and all. Thus in like manner does our <HI>strumous Acidity</HI> operate divers ways; for when it falls upon the <HI>Serum of the Blood,</HI> then follows <HI>Coagulation</HI> in the
<PB N="14" REF="30"/><HI>fibrous Parts</HI> of it, and so it proceeds <HI>uncorrected</HI> to the furthest Members of the Body: But when it penetrates the <HI>Bone</HI> and gets into the <HI>Marrow,</HI> it has a quite contrary <HI>Effect;</HI> and is so far from indurating or hardening them, that it <HI>dissolves</HI> and <HI>putrefies</HI> the very <HI>Hardness</HI> or <HI>Consistency</HI> that it meets with <HI>there.</HI></P>
<P>And thus, in short, having set forth the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Struma,</HI> whether as a <HI>Tumor</HI> or <HI>Ʋlcer;</HI> whether in the <HI>Glan∣dules</HI> or <HI>elsewhere,</HI> by as clear a Light as I could fetch, either from <HI>Authority</HI> or <HI>Reason;</HI> I shall now take upon me in Order of my <HI>Discourse,</HI> to enquire into the various <HI>Causes</HI> of it.</P>

<PB N="15" REF="31"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>The</HI> CAUSES <HI>of it.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THirdly;</HI> I suppose by this time no Man will deny, that the <HI>Praeter∣natural Acidity</HI> of the <HI>Serum of the Blood,</HI> is the immediate <HI>Cause</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil;</HI> as it renders the whole <HI>Lympha</HI> acrimonious and indurated, and thereby produces a <HI>Crass, Glutinous, Coagulated</HI> Matter in several Parts of the Body. But as to the <HI>Mediate</HI> or more <HI>Remote Causes</HI> of the <HI>Scrofula,</HI> there are a great <HI>many</HI> assign'd by the <HI>Learned;</HI> to make it either <HI>Hereditary</HI> from the <HI>Parents,</HI> or <HI>Accidental</HI> from <HI>Air, Diet, Exercise,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>'Tis as manifest, as the Nose upon a Man's Face, that the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Scro∣phulous</HI> or <HI>Strumous Parents,</HI> are com∣monly liable to the same <HI>Distemper;</HI> and so are <HI>Those</HI> that suck the <HI>Milk</HI> of such diseas'd <HI>Nurses.</HI> Now this argues the <HI>Malady</HI> to be deeply imprinted upon the whole <HI>Mass of Blood,</HI> or naturally im∣planted
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>in the very <HI>Constitutions</HI> of some Persons; seeing that it may be, and often is so traduc'd, and entail'd by <HI>Pa∣rents,</HI> thus afflicted and never cur'd, up∣on their <HI>Posterity.</HI></P>
<P>And here I cannot omit one <HI>Observa∣tion</HI> by the By; that <HI>Children</HI> also who are begotten at improper Times of the <HI>Moon,</HI> have been often subject to be af∣flicted with <HI>This Evil,</HI> and to the last Degree too of <HI>Virulency.</HI> Let this be a <HI>Warning</HI> to <HI>Marry'd</HI> People.</P>
<P>But besides <HI>These,</HI> there are some <HI>Per∣sons</HI> whose natural <HI>Temper of Blood</HI> be∣ing very <HI>Acid,</HI> and the <HI>Serum</HI> by that means very apt to <HI>coagulate,</HI> are gene∣rally Obnoxious to it; as <HI>Children</HI> troubled with the <HI>Rickets,</HI> and all <HI>O∣thers</HI> that are <HI>Weakly,</HI> or in whom the <HI>Heat</HI> is not strong enough for a regular <HI>Digestion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>People</HI> likewise may be made very liable to <HI>Scrofulous</HI> crude Humours and Tumors by the <HI>Indisposition</HI> of <HI>Place;</HI> That is, by living always in Extremes of <HI>Air,</HI> either too <HI>thin</HI> or too <HI>thick,</HI> too
<PB N="17" REF="33"/><HI>keen</HI> or too <HI>gross:</HI> For the <HI>Air</HI> is as it were <HI>pabulum vitae,</HI> and must needs have as peculiar an <HI>Influence</HI> upon our Bodies, as our daily <HI>Food</HI> has without Dispute. Besides, <HI>salt, sour, slimy Meats</HI> or <HI>Drinks</HI> may often occasion the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil;</HI> sharp or fulsom <HI>Diet</HI> naturally disposing the <HI>Body</HI> to such a desperate <HI>corroding Disease:</HI> And we can expect no better <HI>Effect</HI> from so bad a <HI>Cause.</HI> And so will the <HI>Want of Exercise</HI> sometimes render the <HI>Blood Corrosive</HI> and full of <HI>Slime</HI> or <HI>Phlegm</HI> or a stagnated <HI>Acidity;</HI> where the <HI>Body</HI> frequently falls into the same <HI>Distemper,</HI> and becomes troubled with hard <HI>Glandulous Flesh,</HI> white <HI>Tumors</HI> or sore <HI>Ulcers</HI> all over the Body. But be∣sides yet, there are Thousands and Thou∣sands of other <HI>Accidents</HI> also, that may produce this malignant <HI>Disease,</HI> in a Body thus predispos'd for it, either by Ill <HI>Ha∣bits</HI> or Irregular <HI>Acts.</HI></P>
<P>However yet I must needs grant, that there are various <HI>Opinions</HI> among divers <HI>Authors</HI> about the <HI>True Causes</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil. Some</HI> think that it pro∣ceeds from the <HI>Succus Nutritius,</HI> being disorder'd in those that feed too much
<PB N="18" REF="34"/>upon <HI>slimy Meats;</HI> whose Phlegmatick, Cold and weak <HI>Digestions,</HI> create a great Mass of crude <HI>Humours;</HI> which being carry'd thence to those distant <HI>Parts af∣fected,</HI> become Hard, Fixt and Unfit for any <HI>Suppuration. Others</HI> again have fan∣cy'd, that die <HI>Imagination</HI> being mightily disturbed by <HI>Want, Sadness</HI> or <HI>Melancholy;</HI> it weakens and disorders the <HI>Digestive Faculty</HI> in the Stomach; and so conse∣quently at long run, produces those knotty <HI>Tumors,</HI> we find in <HI>Scrofulous Patients:</HI> But this seems to be <HI>Ridi∣culous.</HI> There are <HI>Some</HI> yet that say, the <HI>Viscous Nature</HI> of the <HI>Succus Nervo∣rum</HI> must needs be the very <HI>Immediate Efficient Cause</HI> of those <HI>strumous Tumors</HI> in the <HI>Salivatory Glands;</HI> for that the <HI>thick Juice</HI> lying there long, grows har∣der and harder by <HI>coagulating,</HI> and can∣not pass at last, by reason of it's <HI>Indura∣tion.</HI> However, we find <HI>Others</HI> again of a quite different <HI>Opinion;</HI> who a∣scribe the <HI>Cause</HI> of it to a <HI>coagulated Phlegm</HI> or a <HI>sour Blood</HI> in the very <HI>Part</HI> affected: where the <HI>thick Acid Juices</HI> are <HI>obstru∣cted,</HI> grow <HI>stiff</HI> or <HI>obdurate,</HI> and <HI>mag∣nifie</HI> to the last Extremity of <HI>Rancour</HI> or <HI>Foulness.</HI> But <HI>Some,</HI> on the <HI>other hand,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="35"/>will have it to arise immediately from a <HI>Crass Lympha</HI> or <HI>Phlegmatick Humour,</HI> which stops in some <HI>Part</HI> for want of a due <HI>Passage</HI> or Evacuation, and <HI>tu∣mefies</HI> there into what we call it the <HI>Struma.</HI> However, after all yet, the best and most plausible <HI>Opinion</HI> I have met with, seems to be <HI>This;</HI> that the <HI>Scrofula</HI> comes originally from the <HI>Chyle</HI> being <HI>distemper'd;</HI> which by some bad <HI>Fermentation</HI> or other growing <HI>Sour, Acid</HI> and <HI>Corrosive,</HI> afterwards affects the <HI>Mesentery-Glands</HI> in this manner; and so by consequence the <HI>Lympha</HI> being <HI>corrupted</HI> at first, can never after that be <HI>good</HI> for any thing in any other <HI>Part</HI> of the Body, but only to provide a <HI>Patient</HI> for some Person or other, that can cure the <HI>King's Evil.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The <HI>AUTHOR's</HI> Opinion.</HEAD>
<P>AS for my <HI>Part,</HI> I cannot but be∣lieve, that the <HI>King's Evil,</HI> ta∣king it <HI>à primâ origine,</HI> certainly pro∣ceeds from an extraordinary <HI>Acidity</HI> in the <HI>First Digestion;</HI> which <HI>Vice</HI> is never afterwards corrected by the <HI>Second, Third, Fourth,</HI> &amp;c: but conveys its <HI>Ma∣lignity</HI> further, and at once of course spoils the <HI>Chylus,</HI> sharpens the <HI>Blood,</HI> and corrupts the whole <HI>Lympha.</HI> This is what in my Judgment always occa∣sions those <HI>strumous Tumors</HI> or <HI>Ʋlcers,</HI> happen where they will in the Body, as the <HI>Causa sine qua non;</HI> the very <HI>Source</HI> and <HI>Beginning</HI> of the <HI>Malady:</HI> And what <HI>Artist</HI> soever can perfectly <HI>rectifie</HI> that vicious <HI>Acidity</HI> in the <HI>First Digestion,</HI> by <HI>Alcalious Effectual Medicines,</HI> must neces∣sarilly <HI>Cure</HI> the <HI>Distemper</HI> in Course; and as naturally <HI>accomplish</HI> the Work, and with as much <HI>Truth</HI> too, as it is to take away the <HI>Effect</HI> by removing the <HI>Cause:</HI> Which is the main thing, in short, of my <HI>Pretension.</HI></P>
<PB N="21" REF="37"/>
<P>But perhaps some People may judge better yet of this vast, spreading and extensive <HI>Evil,</HI> by my saying some∣thing of the <HI>Parts</HI> commonly <HI>affected;</HI> and shewing particularly how they are concern'd, and how they labour or lan∣guish, under the heavy <HI>Oppression.</HI></P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>The</HI> PARTS <HI>Affected.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>FOurthly;</HI> Now the <HI>Parts</HI> that are most frequently afflicted with the <HI>Struma,</HI> I reckon to be the <HI>Glandules</HI> (that have sometimes pass'd under the Comical Allusive Name of the <HI>Sow</HI> and <HI>Pigs</HI>) the <HI>Muscles, Membranes, Tendons</HI> and <HI>Bones.</HI> The <HI>Viscera</HI> likewise often <HI>suffer</HI> by't: but if the <HI>Nerves</HI> or <HI>Brain</HI> are ever touch'd or tainted with any <HI>scrofulous Humour,</HI> the <HI>Juices</HI> of those Parts are dissolv'd, not <HI>coagulated</HI> nor <HI>tu∣mefy'd,</HI> as I said before of the <HI>Marrow</HI> and the <HI>Bones:</HI> For I have never yet ob∣serv'd any <HI>Tumors</HI> either in the <HI>Nerves</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="38"/>or the <HI>Brain,</HI> but only those <HI>Parts</HI> wa¦sted and grown <HI>Carious</HI> by the <HI>Corrosion</HI> of the vicious <HI>Humours,</HI> and more in∣clin'd to <HI>Putrefaction</HI> than any obdurate Consistency.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Part</HI> that is usually <HI>first</HI> affected with this <HI>Malady,</HI> proves to be the <HI>Mesentery;</HI> for it has often been found by undeniale <HI>Experience</HI> that the <HI>Mesenterick Glands</HI> have been inwardly <HI>strumous,</HI> both as to <HI>Obstruction</HI> and <HI>Tu∣mour;</HI> when at the same time, there have appear'd no visible <HI>Symptoms</HI> of any such <HI>Malignity</HI> Upon the <HI>outward Glands:</HI> Nor indeed has there been any such <HI>scrofulous</HI> Disposition of <HI>Hu∣mour</HI> at all there in Reality. And then again we may depend upon't, that when∣ever the <HI>external Glands</HI> are obstructed and swell'd, the <HI>Mesentericks</HI> are cer∣tainly afflicted in like manner: So that there's no doubt but the <HI>Mesentery</HI> is commonly the <HI>first Part</HI> affected and spoil'd by a <HI>corrosive Acidity</HI> of this Kind.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Glands,</HI> after all is said, are the <HI>principal Seat</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil;</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="39"/>insomuch, that some of the <HI>Antients</HI> re∣strain'd the <HI>Disease</HI> to those <HI>Parts</HI> only, as if no <HI>other</HI> had been <HI>subject</HI> to't: And yet we find many more <HI>Places</HI> notori∣ously <HI>affected</HI> with it to a violent degree. However, considering that there are se∣veral sorts of <HI>Glandules,</HI> whether <HI>Conglo∣bate</HI> or <HI>Conglomerate</HI> (as some call 'em); I cannot but think, that those we term <HI>Reductive,</HI> which serve for the <HI>Percola∣tion</HI> of the <HI>Lympha,</HI> must needs be most afflicted of all <HI>others:</HI> For why? when∣ever the <HI>Serum</HI> or the <HI>Lympha</HI> is so dis∣order'd and grown <HI>Acid,</HI> those <HI>Glands</HI> that perform the Office of <HI>Aquae.ducts,</HI> or <HI>Conduits,</HI> will doubtless <HI>suffer</HI> extreme∣ly, either by <HI>Obstruction,</HI> or by <HI>Corrosion,</HI> or <HI>both.</HI> Now when the <HI>Parts</HI> thro' which the <HI>Lympha</HI> should pass pure and regular, are so <HI>tumefy'd</HI> and <HI>stopp'd up,</HI> we may depend upon it to be an <HI>infallible Symp∣tom</HI> of the <HI>Kings' Evil.</HI></P>
<P>However yet, no <HI>Place</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> more frequently and visibly abounds with <HI>strumous Coagulations,</HI> than the <HI>Neck</HI> quite around; which being <HI>Bare,</HI> especi∣ally in <HI>Women,</HI> is more expos'd to the Sharpness of the <HI>Cold Weather;</HI> and that
<PB N="24" REF="40"/>Quality of the <HI>Air,</HI> without doubt, huge∣ly helps on the <HI>Acid Matter</HI> to stagnate or lodge there, as well as it aggravates the <HI>Evil</HI> in this particular <HI>Part.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed; the <HI>Breasts,</HI> the <HI>Arm∣pits,</HI> the <HI>Lungs</HI> themselves, the <HI>Salivals,</HI> and the <HI>Tonsils</HI> are also sometimes mise∣rably troubl'd with <HI>Scrofulous Tumors;</HI> as will evidently appear to the Eye of any <HI>Common Practicer.</HI></P>
<P>Neither are the <HI>Glands</HI> in the <HI>Groyn</HI> always free from this <HI>Malady,</HI> nor the <HI>Testicles,</HI> nor the <HI>Prostatae,</HI> which are two <HI>Glandules</HI> under the <HI>Seminal Bladders;</HI> tho' it is a little <HI>difficult</HI> sometimes to distinguish those <HI>Tumors</HI> from the <HI>Effects</HI> of another base suspected <HI>Distemper.</HI></P>
<P>So much for the <HI>Natural Glands;</HI> but now there are besides <HI>those,</HI> several <HI>Ad∣ventitious Praeternatural</HI> ones, occasion'd by this <HI>Disease;</HI> which arise visibly in∣fected with the same <HI>Rancour,</HI> in the <HI>Face, Arms, Legs, Skin, Muscles</HI> and <HI>Mem∣branes;</HI> no, and sometimes spreading o∣ver the whole <HI>Body,</HI> from <HI>Head</HI> to <HI>Hands</HI> and <HI>Feet, Fingers</HI> and <HI>Toes;</HI> not excepting the very <HI>Viscera</HI> themselves from being

<P>As to the <HI>Affection</HI> of the <HI>Bones,</HI> 'tis notoriously well known, that setting a∣side the <HI>Glands, they</HI> are as <HI>much troubled</HI> (I might say, <HI>tormented</HI>) with this <HI>cor∣roding Disease,</HI> as any other <HI>Parts</HI> of the <HI>Body;</HI> not to say <HI>more.</HI> But then these are very <HI>distinct</HI> from all <HI>Glandulous Tumors;</HI> for tho' the <HI>Bone</HI> may seem <HI>outwardly</HI> hard and sound, yet the <HI>Juices</HI> are all putrefy'd and rotten <HI>within</HI> at the same time. However, <HI>Bones</HI> will be often al∣so <HI>externally,</HI> as well as <HI>internally</HI> affected with this <HI>venemous Humour;</HI> which al∣ways either <HI>bares</HI> them, or makes 'em very <HI>Carious</HI> and much <HI>Corrupted:</HI> And this commonly happens by the <HI>Contiguity</HI> of some <HI>Membrane</HI> or <HI>Tendon</HI> sorely affli∣cted with this <HI>Acidity</HI> that infects the adjacent <HI>Parts,</HI> or the very <HI>Bones</HI> them∣selves.

<P>In fine, what miserable <HI>Objects</HI> do we daily meet with, even at Death's Door, wasted to meer <HI>Sceletons,</HI> by languish∣ing under this lingring <HI>Disease</HI> in all <HI>Parts</HI> of the <HI>Body;</HI> for want of effectual <HI>Medicines</HI> to heal those <HI>sick</HI> and <HI>wounded</HI> poor Souls!

<HEAD>CHAP V. Of a <HI>PERSON</HI> so afflicted.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FIfthly</HI> then; the <HI>Case</HI> will be <HI>this:</HI> when I was about Seven Years of Age, at <HI>Kingsley</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> it so happen'd, that a large <HI>Scrofulous</HI> or <HI>Strumous Tumor</HI> arose in my <HI>Left Breast;</HI> which afflicted me very much, and in a violent manner
<PB N="27" REF="43"/>too: Upon which, a Neighbouring <HI>Sur∣geon</HI> of Note being sent for, he first made use of <HI>Cataplasms</HI> to break it, and then apply'd several Suppurating <HI>Emplastres;</HI> but all to little or no <HI>Purpose,</HI> save only, that he entertain'd some <HI>Hopes</HI> still of do∣ing me good. However, afterwards he ply'd me over and over with <HI>Catharticks</HI> and <HI>Emeticks,</HI> besides other outward Ap∣plications, in order to <HI>discuss</HI> or <HI>dissolve</HI> the impacted <HI>Humour:</HI> And this <HI>Treat∣ment</HI> lasted a whole Year, but without any greater Success; for I remain'd still in as bad a <HI>Condition,</HI> and as <HI>Languid</HI> as ever.</P>
<P>After this, a second <HI>Surgeon</HI> was im∣mediately imploy'd; who having dili∣gently <HI>dress'd</HI> me about a Year, at last brake the <HI>Swelling,</HI> and also perfectly <HI>heal'd</HI> it to every Bodys thinking; but then it prov'd to be only a palliative <HI>Cure,</HI> for in less than a Month's time, another large <HI>Tumor</HI> fell into my <HI>Left Thigh;</HI> which yet cost both <HI>him</HI> and <HI>my self</HI> a great deal of Trouble for above a Year, before ever we could perceive it any <HI>bet∣ter.</HI> And when we did find it pretty well, as far as we could judge external∣ly,
<PB N="28" REF="44"/>it lasted but for a small time; for in six Weeks after, my <HI>Left Foot</HI> and <HI>Ankle</HI> appear'd <HI>swol'n</HI> to a vast <HI>Bigness:</HI> inso∣much, that a <HI>third Surgeon</HI> then was sent for, who, in less than a <HI>Year's time,</HI> indeed, by what Methods he us'd, effectually <HI>brake</HI> it in Twenty Places a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> least; but however, having <HI>dress'd</HI> it still on for a∣bove a Year and a half, without any <HI>A∣mendment,</HI> he gave it over as <HI>Labour</HI> in vain, and ingenuously advis'd my <HI>Friends</HI> to send me to one of the <HI>Hospitals</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> And accordingly I was carry'd thither at last in a <HI>Horse-Litter,</HI> not be∣ing able to <HI>travel</HI> any other way. Im∣mediately after my Arrival <HI>here</HI> from the <HI>Country,</HI> I was carry'd to St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s <HI>Hospital,</HI> a miserable Object then as I was with the <HI>King's Evil;</HI> where the Best <HI>Surgeons</HI> had no sooner view'd my <HI>Thigh</HI> and <HI>Foot,</HI> but they found them as <HI>Cavous</HI> as <HI>Cony-buries,</HI> and putrefy'd to the very <HI>Bone;</HI> so that, in short, they gave us very little Encouragement of a <HI>Perfect Cure,</HI> or indeed, of any other <HI>Re∣lief;</HI> even so far from it, that they did not design to <HI>dress</HI> me, till my <HI>Father</HI> importun'd them to do it in common Compassion.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="45"/>
<P>To be brief, I was under <HI>their Hands,</HI> and other Eminent <HI>Surgeons,</HI> for full E∣leven Years or upwards; and one of them, indeed, had healed my <HI>Thigh</HI> in that time: But then my <HI>Foot</HI> continu'd as <HI>bad</HI> as ever, not to say <HI>worse.</HI> Where∣upon, <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> of the <HI>Hospital-Surge∣ons</HI> consulted about it; and despairing of any <HI>Cure,</HI> were absolutely unanimous for <HI>Amputation.</HI> I readily agreed to't, how unwillingly soever; and the Day was fix'd. Upon this, my <HI>Father</HI> asking them, if the <HI>Cutting-off my Leg</HI> would secure the <HI>Distemper</HI> from <HI>breaking out</HI> again in a∣ny other Part of my Body? <HI>They</HI> told him flatly, That they could <HI>secure</HI> no∣thing; <HI>it</HI> might break out again in a Month's time, for any thing they knew to the contrary.</P>
<P>Now, by this time, my whole <HI>Body</HI> Was so <HI>emaciated</HI> and <HI>weak,</HI> that I could not support my self without my <HI>Crutches,</HI> and I had not set my <HI>Left Foot</HI> to the Ground for near <HI>Seven Years.</HI> But, as <HI>Providence</HI> would have it, before the <HI>Day</HI> came that was fix'd for <HI>cutting off my Leg,</HI> we were well recommended to one Mr.
<PB N="30" REF="46"/><HI>Joseph Turner,</HI> a considerable <HI>Surgeon;</HI> who gave us greater <HI>Hopes,</HI> and the comfor∣table <HI>Encouragement</HI> of a <HI>Cure,</HI> without <HI>Amputation.</HI> In short, he pass'd his word, that I should, in all Probability, be perfectly <HI>well</HI> within a Years time; and according to his Promise, I soon found my self, by his <HI>Management</HI> and <HI>Medicines,</HI> in the direct way to be restord to my <HI>Limbs</HI> and <HI>Health,</HI> beyond <HI>Relapse;</HI> for in a <HI>Quarter of a Year,</HI> I perceiv'd my self infinitely <HI>better,</HI> and could set my <HI>Foot</HI> to the <HI>Ground;</HI> in a <HI>Quarter</HI> more, a large <HI>Pill-Box</HI> full of <HI>foul Bones</HI> came away from the ulcerated <HI>Parts,</HI> and several of the <HI>Ʋlcers</HI> were quite <HI>healed up;</HI> in about <HI>three Quarters</HI> time, I could easily walk about without my <HI>Crutches;</HI> and before the <HI>Year</HI> was ex∣pir'd, I was perfectly well <HI>recover'd,</HI> and <HI>bound</HI> an <HI>Apprentice</HI> to the very same Mr. <HI>Turner</HI> (an <HI>excellent Surgeon</HI>) for Seven Years. And now I could not but think my self <HI>Happy,</HI> and bless <HI>GOD,</HI> that I had fall'n into such <HI>effectual</HI> and <HI>good Hands</HI> in both Respects.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of the <HI>AUTHOR'S</HI> MASTER.</HEAD>
<P>BUT to go on; during my whole <HI>Apprenticeship,</HI> I observ'd that my <HI>Master</HI> had all sorts of <HI>Practice;</HI> but more especially in <HI>Scrofulous,</HI> or <HI>Venereal Ca∣ses.</HI> He had a Great <HI>Name</HI> for either of those <HI>Distempers.</HI> He cur'd abundance of <HI>Patients,</HI> of both <HI>Sexes</HI> and of all <HI>Ages,</HI> without one Grain of <HI>Mercury;</HI> even after they had been given over by many other Eminent <HI>Professors,</HI> as well as ig∣norant <HI>Pretenders.</HI> He did not admi∣nister many <HI>Catharticks,</HI> and very few <HI>Emeticks;</HI> but gave <HI>Diureticks</HI> in abun∣dance. <HI>His external Applications</HI> like∣wise were quite different from what I ever <HI>then</HI> saw, or heard of <HI>since</HI> that <HI>Time.</HI> Besides, I prepar'd all the <HI>Me∣dicines</HI> he made use or with my own Hands for several Years; and I am mo∣rally certain, there is not an <HI>Ounce</HI> of the same <HI>Medicines,</HI> either <HI>External</HI> or <HI>In∣ternal,</HI> prepar'd by any <HI>Person</HI> but my <HI>Self</HI> in <HI>London</HI> to this very Day: As I
<PB N="32" REF="48"/>could easily prove by the <HI>Druggists,</HI> upon Occasion.</P>
<P>However it must needs be granted, that there are of late Days started up several Great <HI>Pretenders;</HI> who, accord∣ing to their own <HI>Report</HI> and <HI>Ostentation,</HI> have effectually <HI>Cur'd</HI> many Persons of <HI>scrofulous Diseases:</HI> And I heartily wish only, that they <HI>did</HI> throughly understand what they <HI>pretend</HI> to with so much <HI>Assu∣rance;</HI> for <HI>then</HI> I should not be troubled with half so many deplorable <HI>Patients,</HI> as I daily meet with in a languishing Con∣dition, who have generally been tam∣per'd with by <HI>Empericks,</HI> labour'd under <HI>Five</HI> or <HI>Six</HI> Hands (or as <HI>many</HI> as I my self was under formerly) and to as little <HI>Effect.</HI> And therefore give me leave to say, that though the <HI>Distemper</HI> is bad enough at the <HI>first Appearance</HI> of it, yet it might be happily <HI>Cur'd</HI> in a great deal less Time, if that pernicious <HI>Corro∣sive Humour</HI> was not suffer'd to lurk so long, under unskilful Hands, as to de∣stroy the <HI>Flesh</HI> and foul the <HI>Bones:</HI> For upon my Word, there is not One <HI>Pa∣tient</HI> in Ten, but I find him either so <HI>neglected</HI> or <HI>abus'd,</HI> that for want of be∣ing
<PB N="33" REF="49"/>duly or skilfully manag'd at <HI>first,</HI> I am commonly forc'd to wait for <HI>Exfo∣liation</HI> with Patience, before I can per∣fect the <HI>Cure.</HI> But besides, I have <HI>Cur'd</HI> several Persons in the <HI>remote Parts</HI> of this Kingdom, upon receiving an exact Account of their <HI>Malady</HI> by <HI>Letters,</HI> in far less Time, than <HI>Those</HI> I dress every Day, in and about <HI>London;</HI> and I cannot ascribe This to any other <HI>Reason,</HI> but because I had the good Fortune to be their <HI>first Surgeon.</HI></P>
<P>And moreover, my <HI>Medicines</HI> are also as Prevalent and Expeditious in <HI>Venereal Cases,</HI> to Admiration: For indeed they are so Powerful, and Successful, by the Blessing of <HI>God,</HI> that I have cur'd several sad <HI>Spectacles</HI> of the most virulent <HI>Ʋlcers,</HI> whose <HI>Bodies</HI> have been cover'd all over with <HI>Scurf, Scabs</HI> and <HI>Spots</HI> innumerable as well as frightful to the <HI>Beholder.

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AND now having quite <HI>finished</HI> what I at <HI>First</HI> propos'd about the <HI>King's Evil;</HI> as to the <HI>Name,</HI> the <HI>Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Causes</HI> of it, as well as the <HI>Parts</HI> affected, the <HI>Case</HI> of a Person so afflict∣ed, and the <HI>Cure</HI> of the <HI>Disease</HI> by Ex∣perience: I might here make some <HI>Apology</HI> according to <HI>Custom, Fashion,</HI> or <HI>Formality,</HI> for the <HI>Meaness</HI> of the <HI>Perfor∣mance;</HI> but I am none of that modish <HI>Temper,</HI> or complaisant <HI>Faculty</HI> in Wri∣ting, as only to oblige the <HI>Airy People</HI> of the Age by a dissembling Modesty. And therefore I have chose rather to send this <HI>Treatise</HI> (such as it is) into the wide World; barely with this pa∣tient <HI>Motto</HI> of Indifferency along with it, or <HI>Terence</HI>'s Wish, for its <HI>Welsare:</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>UPon <HI>second Thoughts,</HI> it may, per∣haps, be expected by the <HI>Publick,</HI> that I should give some Account of my <HI>Medicines</HI> above-mention'd, both as to the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> of them: And therefore, as I would not <HI>omit</HI> any thing <HI>material</HI> that might <HI>oblige</HI> the World, so I could not, for the better Satisfaction of People, forbear making the following <HI>Proposals,</HI> by way of <HI>After-Thought.</HI></P>
<P>I. As for my <HI>Alcalious</HI> and <HI>Diuretick Me∣dicines,</HI> which I give <HI>internally</HI> in all Cases of the <HI>King's Evil,</HI> with the greatest <HI>Safety</HI> imaginable; they certainly correct every praeternatural <HI>Acidity</HI> in the <HI>first Digestion,</HI> which is the <HI>primary Cause</HI> of all other <HI>ill Effects</HI> in the Body. They give the <HI>Patient</HI> an extraordinary <HI>Ap∣petite,</HI> comfort the <HI>Vitals,</HI> throw off the <HI>morbifick Humour</HI> from the <HI>Viscora</HI> or <HI>Bowels</HI> to the Extreme Parts of the <HI>Body;</HI> cheer the <HI>Spirits,</HI> strengthen the <HI>Nerves,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="70"/>and at last sweeten the whole <HI>Mass of Blood:</HI> Giving immediate <HI>Ease</HI> also to <HI>Persons</HI> under the most violent, acute and corroding <HI>Pains,</HI> in what Part so∣ever afflicted, either with <HI>scrofulous Tu∣mors</HI> or <HI>Ʋlcers.</HI> Besides, I must needs say, that several <HI>languishing People,</HI> who have had the Use of their <HI>Limbs</HI> taken from them by those <HI>Evils,</HI> for a consi∣derable time together, have yet been perfectly restor'd by these powerful Al∣cali's, beyond Expectation. I need not mention <HI>many</HI> more also, who have been <HI>Convulsive</HI> to the last degree of Danger and Despair, that have been preserv'd in like manner, and effectually <HI>cur'd,</HI> both of their <HI>Fits</HI> and the <HI>Disease</HI> by the same <HI>Medicines;</HI> even when <HI>Opiates</HI> themselves have prov'd <HI>ineffective,</HI> and where all other <HI>Means</HI> have fail'd of <HI>Success.</HI> Only give me Leave to add over and above, that <HI>they</HI> are very pleasant to the <HI>Tast;</HI> and the largest <HI>Quantity</HI> that I give to any one <HI>Patient</HI> at once, doth not exceed the Bigness of a <HI>common Pea.</HI> In short, they are wonderfully <HI>Gentle</HI> and <HI>Easie</HI> in their <HI>O∣peration,</HI> so that they work only by <HI>Per∣spiration</HI> and <HI>Ʋrine,</HI> without any Stress
<PB N="55" REF="71"/>upon <HI>Nature</HI> or Confinement from <HI>Bu∣siness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. And as those <HI>Cordial Alcali's</HI> which are both of a <HI>Diuretick</HI> and <HI>Diaphoretick</HI> Virtue, contribute very much towards bringing any <HI>malignant strumous Tumors</HI> to a palpable <HI>Suppuration</HI> the sooner, so they happily prepare the <HI>Parts</HI> affected for the immediate Application of my <HI>Digestive Balsam;</HI> which is so Power∣ful in its <HI>Digestion,</HI> that without either <HI>Caustick</HI> or <HI>Incision,</HI> or any other painful <HI>Treatment,</HI> it does in a short time, gently lay open the most inveterate <HI>Swelling</HI> of what kind soever, in the <HI>Glands</HI> or <HI>else∣where;</HI> it sucks out the cold, curdl'd and coagulated <HI>Cores;</HI> exfoliates the foul <HI>Bones,</HI> destroys the <HI>Callow Lips</HI> of the <HI>Sores, mundisies, incarns,</HI> and absolutely <HI>cicatrizes</HI> the <HI>Parts</HI> aggriev'd, by its <HI>bal∣samick</HI> and <HI>healing Virtue.</HI> But I will here presume to say by the <HI>By,</HI> that I have wrought as great and remarkable <HI>Cures</HI> with it also upon <HI>Cancers;</HI> altho' treated by many <HI>others,</HI> whether <HI>Artists</HI> or unskilful <HI>Pretenders,</HI> a long time without any commendable <HI>Success:</HI> For by dressing them a few times with this
<PB N="56" REF="72"/><HI>Digestive Balsam,</HI> the <HI>Patients</HI> have forth∣with been sensibly reliev'd, and found a great deal of <HI>Ease</HI> from such tormenting <HI>Maladies.</HI> 'Tis matter of Fact, that in all the <HI>Cancers</HI> I have had under my Care, this <HI>Balsam,</HI> by the Help of my <HI>Alcalious Medicines,</HI> hath never fail'd yet of <HI>digesting</HI> that filthy, sanious, sharp, foetid, ob∣stinate <HI>Humour</HI> into laudable <HI>Pus</HI> or <HI>Mat∣ter;</HI> and hath also in a reasonable time, discharg'd the whole <HI>Cancerous</HI> Substance and cur'd its <HI>Malignity,</HI> without leaving the least <HI>Hardness</HI> or <HI>Pain,</HI> or <HI>Danger</HI> of <HI>Relapse</HI> behind it. In a word, this same <HI>Digestive Balsam</HI> is likewise of that clean∣sing and healing <HI>Nature;</HI> that, in case of any gross <HI>Scurf, Scabs, Pimples, Blotch∣es,</HI> or even <HI>Leprous-spots</HI> in the <HI>Face,</HI> or any other remote <HI>Parts</HI> of the Body, it being apply'd at <HI>Night</HI> only going to <HI>Bed,</HI> without any offensive <HI>Smell,</HI> painful <HI>In∣fluence,</HI> or disagreeable <HI>Sight,</HI> will gent∣ly attract and suck out the peccant <HI>Hu∣mour,</HI> and in course quickly restore the <HI>Skin</HI> to its perfect <HI>Beauty</HI> or Natural <HI>Smoothness.</HI></P>
<PB N="57" REF="73"/>
<P N="3">III. In fine, as to my <HI>Discussive Em∣plastre,</HI> it is of such a Sovereign <HI>Virtue,</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> that let a <HI>scrofulous Tumor</HI> be never so Hard and Obstinate to resist all <HI>suppurative Medicines</HI> whatever, tho' it be of the largest Size and Figure; yet this <HI>ef∣ficatious Discutient,</HI> being apply'd only once a Week, opens the <HI>Pores</HI> so power∣fully, and discharges the <HI>sharp Humour</HI> so much by <HI>Sweat,</HI> that in short, at last, by the Assistance of my <HI>Alcalious</HI> and <HI>Diuretick Medicines,</HI> it perfectly <HI>discusses</HI> and <HI>annihilates</HI> the whole vitious <HI>Coagu∣lation.</HI> The <HI>Nature</HI> of this <HI>Emplastre</HI> is as <HI>strength'ning</HI> also, as it is undeniably <HI>discussive;</HI> and it does not only <HI>disperse</HI> the <HI>acrimonious Humour,</HI> but as well al∣so <HI>fortifies</HI> the <HI>Part</HI> that was affected with the most obdurate <HI>Tumor;</HI> against any future <HI>Relapse.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the <HI>Benefit</HI> of the <HI>Publick,</HI> I propose, that any <HI>Persons</HI> who live in the <HI>Remote Parts</HI> of the Kingdom, may be supply'd with all these <HI>Medicines,</HI> both <HI>Internal</HI> and <HI>External,</HI> and with particular <HI>Directions</HI> also how to make
<PB N="58" REF="74"/><HI>use</HI> of 'em; upon giving me an exact <HI>Ac∣count</HI> of their Constitutions, and the Nature of their <HI>Maladies.</HI></P>
<P>☞ I have also an <HI>Excellent SECRET,</HI> which in One Hour's time, <HI>cures</HI> the <HI>Tooth-ach</HI> without Drawing, and pre∣vents it from ever Returning; as a great many of the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> and several Hundreds of others in this Ci∣ty and Suburbs, for Twelve Years last past, have found by Experience. Be∣ing the Author of this <HI>Medicine,</HI> to pre∣vent its being Couterfeited, I do dispose of none but what I apply my self.</P>
