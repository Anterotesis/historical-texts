<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N search of Things, laudable and praise∣worthy, <HI>Ambition</HI> is a <HI>Vertue.</HI> Prior to other Men, those of our Profession are required to pursue their Progressive Improvement in this Case; but we must climb the Hill; Vertue sits o' Top. Care is painful; the Charge of Men, and Women's Lives, and Limbs revolves
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>the Surgeon's Breast. To retain his Tranquility he is to proceed in his Business, according to the re∣ceived Maxims, and approved Me∣thod of the best Practitioners. Learning gives Tranquility of Mind; it points the Road to Re∣putation and Riches.</P>
<P>IT is a Maxim among Infidels to speak well of all Men as far as Vertue will permit; Slander is base, and does recriminate. It is far from me to derogate from the Masters of your Hospital,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Tho— s.</NOTE> but who among such Folks imparts his Knowledge, and if they do, ought not young Men to proceed in their Research: Reputation lost, is hardly retrieva∣ble; we are not to risk this rashly: On the other Hand, the World is apt to form a great Idea of a Sur∣geon of an enterprizing Genius; they presume that his Knowledge
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>is well founded; so they may, be∣ing attended with Success. Te∣merity puts a Man off his Guard; this is subject to great Danger.</P>
<P>THE Reduction of Fractures, and Dislocations is a great and necessary Article in a Surgeon's Business; to decline this, is inconsistent with his Character, see himself postponed to a country Fellow, in all other res∣pects inferior to him. Granting that many of those People set Bones at random, you will not easily be believed in saying so, even when they miscarry. There is Reason to retort, that good Surgeons fail in this Case, tho' Men are required to speak Truth, it would be a Hardship on Surgeons to tell all which they know, or believe: they would confess that sometimes the Swelling confounds them in distinguishing the Species of Frac∣tures,
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>particularly Luxations. This Reflection ought to put young Sur∣geons under an indispensible Ob∣ligation to distinguish the great Variety also of Sub Luxations, and be familiarly conversant with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her Rules of Art, to arm against C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngencies. When you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n instructed in the <HI>Osteology,</HI> the <HI>Myology,</HI> and the <HI>Angiology,</HI> the History of the Bones, the Mus∣cles, and the Blood-Vessels, you will cut without Danger, by the Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Re-place of the Head of the Bone, see how and where the Muscles and Ligaments are banded, and relaxed; then from the in∣tense Pain, the privation of Mo∣tion, and the Position, judge where the Distortion is made, notwith∣standing the Swelling. This Rule will direct you in adjusting the Ex∣tension, and in moderating the Vi∣olence.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<P>WHEN the Femur, the Thigh, is dislocated backward; I mean when the Head of the Bone is un∣der the <HI>Gluti,</HI> or <HI>Fleshchi,</HI> the three Extensor Muscles of the Fe∣mur, all Authors, as well as other Surgeons, agree, few contradict, that the Reduction is impractible, by Reason that the Head of the Bone cannot be removed; especially in that the Ligament, <HI>Tarsor,</HI> being broke, the Bone will not keep in it's Place: I will demonstrate how this Luxati∣on may be reduced, and by what Means the Ligament restored.</P>
<P>RULES will be given respect∣ing Fractures, particularly the Ob∣lique, and Transverse-Fracture of the Femur, the Thigh bone, which cannot be felt, by Reason afore∣said.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<P>EXCELLENT Directions Will be given to keep the Com∣pound-Fracture free from Pain, and without the exfoliating the Bone, cure the Wound with Facili∣ty, and Promptitude. In depart∣ing from these Rules the menacing Accidents rising high, the Life of the Diseased is cast away, or hangs in doubt.</P>
<P>YOU will be apprized of an Er∣ror in a reputed great Author:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wiseman.</NOTE> this for many Years has been a stum∣bling Block to his Practising-Suc∣cessors, and sometimes fatal to the Subject, if he escaped with his Life, he underwent a long Weakness, and not seldom a Deformity in his Limb. I am acquainted with a Gentleman, a shameful Example of this Error in two great Surgeons in Concert, one of them a Grandee of the first
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>Class; the Afflicted deplores the Remembrance of his Sorrow, and the Loss of the Use of his Elbow; these in a great Measure might have been prevented, with no danger of his Life, or Lameness, little Pain, loss of Time, or Expence compara∣tive.</P>
<P>BY the Indication of the Pulse, and of the Urine, you may betimes animate your Digestive, then by change of Dressing turn gradu∣ally the redundant Discharge to In∣carn the Wound, and generate, and confirm the Callous: This Practice must needs be just, seeing that by certain Tokens in the Matter or Discharge, this is known to be the Chyle, and indeed the native Balm of the Blood which cures all Wounds. In this Case, Old People seldom recover their Strength; the Spirit and Balsam of the Blood is
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>evaporated: This is become Cadave∣rous.</P>
<P>IF I do not take upon me to determine the controverted Hypo∣theses in Theory, it is not improba∣ble but in this I shall make a plea∣sing Advance.</P>
<P>IN this Sentiment you will find yourself in Condition to distin∣guish Books; was I to speak my Opinion of them, I must own that there are not many worth reading. It is not hard to comprize in a Sheet or two of Paper, what is ma∣terial in some of the best of them, particularly those of the Practice of Surgery.</P>
<P>WITH a copious, and beauti∣ful Variety of Topics, you shall have the Occasional Method of In∣ternal Prescription, to digest
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>Wounds of the Brain, and Wounds of the <HI>Viscera.</HI> Of all other, Gunshot Wounds in the Joints are formidable to Nature. Application of actua∣ting, fortifying, and resolutive Me∣decines of various Kinds not ge∣nerally known are to be made ac∣cording to the Exigency of the Wound: the Surgeon is to steer his Course, as it were, between <HI>Cha∣rybdis</HI> and <HI>Scylla,</HI> a Rock, and a Sand, as they term it. Without adding Fewel to the burning Fe∣ver, he is to cherish the <HI>Genus Ner∣vosam;</HI> from thence the interes∣sing Soul sends continually Suc∣cours of Animal Spirits in Aid of Nature in the unequal War with her united cruel Enemies Pain, Fever, Thirst, Burning, Watching, Delirium. In Failure of these Spi∣rits to rarify, and animate the con∣densing Blood, to digest the Wound, alleviate the Pain, and support or
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>strengthen the Heart, labouring under the redoubling Pulse, the mortal Symptoms prevailing; the noble Organs ceasing to perform their Vital and Animal Functions, the Soul deprived of her Power, is forced to depart.</P>
<P>YOU should learn to despamate, secern, and transfer the dangerous Rellux of purulent Matter oppres∣sing the Blood, and Animal Spirits with Restlessness, Fever, <HI>Delirium,</HI> the Hickok, Lethargy, Apoplexy, Convulsions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Harbinger of Death.</P>
<P>UPON a sudden Suppression of Sweat sometimes this becomes a Hetorene Humour, and with pun∣gent Pain vellicats the <HI>Intestines,</HI> the <HI>Missentory,</HI> the <HI>Pleura,</HI> the <HI>Mediastinum,</HI> the <HI>Pericranium,</HI> and other Parts greatly subject to
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>Resentment. Of all Cases this em∣barasses the Surgeon; Secretion be∣ing the Work of Nature he cannot appoint the Time, nor till this is accomplished hardly obtain a Res∣pite, or Cessation of the Violence: This seems to have been the late Case of a great King which for what we could perceive his Physicians and Surgeons knew, yet like a <HI>Starrost</HI> with his Hand on his Sabre in Se∣nate, they were for defending their Argument in the Antichamber.</P>
<P><HI>Laudanum</HI> is our great Anodyne, this we are forbid; it restrains the Transfusion of the Animal Spirits on which depends the Function and Formality of the Parts, also the Energy of the secerning Blood. A continued Use of this Medicine may render the Disease incurable, or of a long Duration. Purging and Bleeding interrupt Nature: She has chose to deliver herself by
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>the denographical, or culicular Glands, and will not be controuled. Perspirating, Alexipharmic, and Volatile Medicines are of a little Effect till towards the <HI>Crisis;</HI> Na∣ture alone maintains the Conflict; Hence it happens that sometimes she does not overcome till from a Vernal Solstice chiefly, the Blood has received an Accession of Warmth to ferment, and discharge in the Surface.</P>
<P>SOME Years ago I tended a Gen∣tleman who upon drinking cold Water when hot, and Sweating was seized with a violent Pain in the nervous Tunicle of his Bowels. After a tedious Indisposition a large Abscess was formed in his Groin. Tho' I opened the Swelling as soon as it fluctuated: The Blood and Spirits were so tainted, and charged with this foreign Humour,
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>that he had an accelerated, a low, and an irregular Pulse; was delirious, had cold clam Sweatings, an Hic∣kok, a Diarrhea and a Gangarene round the Border of the Wound; also an advanced Mortification on the Inside of That Knee. In five or six Days the Wound discharged so many Quarts of a lixive, ganger Lymph: When the Mortification was stopt and a Separation made one might turn his Hand in the Wound quite to the <HI>Peritoneum</HI> in sight. Now the mortal Symptoms began to remit: In less than five Weeks the Wound was sicatrized. You will agree that the Cure depend∣ed on proper Internals; had there been a Defect in the Dressings he must have perished, so he would had I fatigued him with Pain.</P>
<P>BETWEEN two and three Years ago, one Mrs <HI>Gyles,</HI> had for
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>Year before, a continual Diarrhea, or <HI>Lienterria;</HI> the Chyle, or Nou∣rishment, ran off, the greatest Part of it before it entered the Lacteals. In the Spring of the Year a large, cold, white, fluctuating Swelling grew on her right <HI>Hypondria</HI> be∣low the Ribs. From the begin∣ning she had an aching Pain shoot∣ing deep into the Liver; the Seat or Source of her Indisposition; a suppressed Sweat transferred. A considerable Surgeon in Town told her to be well advised in whom she trusted, and that he did not o∣pen the Swelling too soon. In a∣bout a Week I stopt the Loosness: In eight, or nine Days more the Swelling became warm, and red∣dish, but frightfully increased in Bigness: I told her now was the Time; she yielding, I opened the Swelling with a Lancet; there was a Bason of a Quart and half a Pint of
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>formed Matter catcht; here and there streaked with Blood, toward the End. She, and others who saw the shifted Cloths and Bedding did believe that in 48 Hours the Wound did run a Gallon, and in four Nights two Quarts more; in all Six Quarts. The Return of the Diarrhea was what I apprehended most: This happened the first Night attended with cold, clam Sweating, a trembling Pulse, and Fainting; so again the second Night; and were as often taken off. In few Days more she mended daily, and in three Weeks was quite well: Then she grew Fat, Healthful, and Strong. She is lately married to <HI>James Taylor,</HI> a White-smith in <HI>Hatfield-street.</HI></P>
<P>IN five Weeks I cured a Gentle∣woman of a large Mortification in her Loins extending on the <HI>Os
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>Sacrum,</HI> and the <HI>Coxis,</HI> to affect the Sphinctures of the <HI>Anus,</HI> and the Bladder, cut off the Course of the Spirits, that she rendered her Ex∣crements involuntary. In the be∣ginning she had a Fever of the Spi∣rits, a Delirium, cold Sweatings, and a Syncopa.</P>
<P>THESE Cures well understood, and the Medicines given will, with Variations, be a Precedent in many Grand Cases; nor are the Internal Things mentioned in any Book on such Occasions; yet which no Phy∣cisian, or Surgeon, speaking with∣out Prejudice, can disavow: They will, and must needs own that if any one ever was, these People, all of them by Medicine, were brought back from the Gates of the Grave.</P>
<P>WHAT deserves Remark; there was no Ruburb, or Astringent, no
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>Opiate, or Theriaca given in the Diarrhea, the Cortex suspends, or restrains Secretion; so does <HI>Lau∣danum:</HI> This shuts the Avenues of the Nerves, binding, or cente∣ring the Animal Spirits, it leavens the Blood, and opposes Digestion and Re-union. I shall occasionally speak farther of these Medicines, and how they may be given safely; here they would have been mortal by Reason of the Nervous Fever.</P>
<P>IN case of a Collection in the <HI>Mediastinum, De Verney</HI> says we may trepan the <HI>Sternum.</HI> He was Professor of Anatomy in the Roy∣al Garden at <HI>Paris,</HI> and probably the greatest that ever lived, taken throughout. He Illustrated his De∣monstrations of all Parts of the Body with his comparative Anatomy of Horses, Calves, Dogs, Cats, Fowl, Fish, Frogs, Eggs; including his
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>public Lectures, and Course of Operations. His Course of Anato∣my lasted from the Beginning of <HI>September</HI> till the end of <HI>March,</HI> all the Week (Sundays, and Holidays excepted) from Morning till Night, an Hour at Noon allowed. He was Forty Years Royal-Professor; had read all valuable Books; was thought to be one of the greatest Orators in <HI>France.</HI> Being of easy Access his Scholars had a fair Op∣portunity of Improvement. His Papers would have made a Volume little less than a Church-Bible; but they never were published. Few can judge of the Loss, yet this may easily be perceived in the Defects, and Impertinencies in Mens Dis∣course and Writings on this Sub∣ject, some who hold their Heads high.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
<P>YOU shall see the several In∣tentions practised to restrain the Affluence of Suppuration, which procrastinates, and defeats the Cure of Wounds, and renders Ulcers sinous, callous, and fistulous, then by exalting, and displaying, reba∣ting, and correcting the Blood, ren∣der this subservant to your Purpose.</P>
<P>YOU will be entertained with an Essay on the <HI>Hernia</HI> of the Parts, will learn to disengage the Intes∣tine <HI>Ilion</HI> strangled in the tendous Perforation of the great Oblique, the external Muscle of the <HI>Abdo∣men;</HI> and how to prevent the Return of the <HI>Ilion</HI> into the <HI>Inguin,</HI> or Groin. Such is the Force of a few ex∣ternal Medicines, that they effect the Cure of the Rupture in People ad∣vanced in Years, if I do not say without help of a Truss, this I have done, upon considering
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>them well, and how they are adapted to several Pur∣poses co-operating, you will per∣ceive that they bear the greatest Congruity to Reason, and Proba∣bility of Success; should they fail, or fall short in what is promised, others are appointed to sustain the Effort, strike off the Symptoms as they arrive. In fine, you shall have a System of Prescriptions to tra∣verse the Train of Appearances, and anticipate the dangerous Ope∣ration of the <HI>Bubonocele</HI> or stran∣gled Rupture even when the ver∣micular, the peristaltic, or natu∣ral Motion of the Intestines is in∣verted, and they vomit their Ex∣crements as in the Micere, or Ili∣ac Passion.</P>
<P>ASK at Mr <HI>Baker</HI> a Cooper in <HI>Nottingham-street:</HI> I cured his Wife of a strangling of the Bowels
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>attended with violent Pain and Sickness, when without Passage downwards, she for Eight Days vo∣mited every thing that she took.</P>
<P>WHEN on this Occasion, and probably in this Manner, you have had the good Fortune to redeem, or ransom Men from Death; you should fence them with Strength, brace the unbended Muscles, and the expanded Tendons, restore the Resort of the relaxed Ring, to with∣stand the Protrusion of the Intes∣tine, and of the <HI>Epiploon</HI> into the <HI>Ain,</HI> or <HI>Inguin,</HI> and the <HI>Scro∣tum,</HI> the Seat of the <HI>Bubonocele,</HI> and of the Complete <HI>Hernia.</HI></P>
<P>I have a Sheet of Paper wrote throughout on the Cause and Cure of the Rupture.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
<P>FROM the long and often∣times repeated Experience which I have had of my Method of Cure of the Rupture, I will, and do en∣gage to take only Twenty Shillings for Things, nor will I ask more if I do not cure the Diseased abso∣lutely, if through Neglect, or o∣therwise they do not profane the Use of my Medicines. I will, put them to no Pain, Trouble, or In∣conveniency farther than to wear a Cotton-Truss 10 or 12 Days till my Medicines do take Place.</P>
<P>YOU will take Notice that this Promise is to be understood with some Exceptions, or Restrictions, respecting great Age and Weak∣ness.</P>
<P>MR <HI>Mitchell,</HI> Colourman over-against Haberdashers Hospital in <HI>Hoxton;</HI> had his eldest Son born
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>with a Complete Rupture. I cured him at Ten Years old.</P>
<P>A Scholar at the Latin Boarding School at <HI>Edmonton</HI> was lately cu∣red by me of a complete Rupture on both Sides the Intestine, or Bowel, quite down in the <HI>Scrotum.</HI> Send to Mr <HI>Harrow</HI> Master of the Boarding School.</P>
<P>YOU shall learn to supercede successfully the Stitch, or Suture of the Tendon, cure the Wound, and recover the Use of the Part soo∣ner, and with far less Pain, than by the Operation.</P>
<P>THE Cure of the painful <HI>An∣chylose,</HI> or White Swelling in the Joint, is a Consideration of no little Import, and known but to a few. You shall see how to give a present Judgment of this, and
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>cure all curable Kinds; this will go far. I have wrought Miracles of this sort, so may you with help of my Thesis on this Subject.</P>
<P>I have an Essay on the Circulati∣on of the Blood in the <HI>Foetus,</HI> and on the Nourishment of the <HI>Foetus.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is alluring to the Ear: You shall hear a Discourse on the Parts of Generation in Women, and on the Law of Formation, the Pre-existence of Lineaments in the <HI>Ovum.</HI></P>
<P>I will annex an Essay on the Passions and Affections, accounting for them from the near, and fami∣liar Consent of the Various <HI>Plexus</HI> of Nerves, and the intimate Cor∣respondence of the Animal Spirits reciprocating in them.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
<P>You shall be convinced of the Certainty of extracting the Stone in the <HI>Urethra,</HI> without Danger of having the Wound remain Fistu∣lous.</P>
<P>To many opposite Digressions on the other great and necessary Heads of Anatomy and Surgery; I will give a Process on the <HI>Bron∣chocele,</HI> the glairous Swelling of the Glands <HI>Thyroides,</HI> threatning a Suffocation from the Pressure of the Swelling on the flexible Part of the Annular Cartilages of the <HI>Aspera Arteria.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT a Year ago, I opened an Ulcer in the Roof of Captain <HI>Hughes</HI>'s Mouth: I exfoliated, and took out the Bone of the Pallat. Inquire at Mrs <HI>Starky</HI>'s in <HI>Dean∣street,</HI> by <HI>Red-Lyon Square.</HI> The Captain will show the Bone, and
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>that the Wound stands sound, nor can you perceive any Alteration in his Speech.</P>
<P>THREE Years ago I opened and cured a <HI>Scrofolous,</HI> or <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil</HI> Swelling in a Gentlewoman's Neck. Inquire at Mr <HI>Kitchen</HI>'s Ba∣ker in <HI>Buckle-street,</HI> by <HI>Red Lyon∣street, Goodman Fields.</HI></P>
<P>AN eminent Surgeon in Town will witness, that when with Three Bolusses of fourteen Grains of my <HI>Panacea</HI> I fluxed a Man Thirty Days; I opened the ulcerated Skin of his Nose. I cauterized the ca∣rious Bones several Times: I took out the Bridge, the <HI>Ossa Nasalia,</HI> both of them, and without sinking the spungy Bone underneath to make a Blemish; I cured him also of an Ulcer in his Throat large e∣nough to receive a small Apple;
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>an <HI>Exostosis</HI> on his Wrist, and one on the second Joint of his great Toe; of all which he held well se∣veral Years, till he died of another Distemper.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I recovered a Woman brought to Bed in the Height of her Flux under all the dengerous Circumstances of a great Effusion.</NOTE> Other Surgeons give 150 Grains of <HI>Mercurius Dulcis,</HI> or more; consequently my Method of cure of the Venerel Dis∣ease is much safer, nor is it less effectual, than a Flux raised by Unc∣tion, whereas their Method of Sali∣vation comes far short in Certainty.</P>
<P>I saw a great Surgeon in Town give fourteen Grains of <HI>Mercurius Dulcis,</HI> and seven Grains of <HI>Tur∣bith</HI> Mineral, or yellow <HI>Mercury,</HI> for one Dose in a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> a run∣ning of the Reins as they call it. He told me that the Brotherhood speak as they please, but this is what they give, and even in greater
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>quantity, whereas I do not exceed ten Grains of my <HI>Panacea,</HI> and that castrated of its vitriolic cor∣rosive Points, in which is the Dan∣ger: It is by this Means that so small a Quantity of my <HI>Panacea</HI> raises a Salivation. It is true that I mix another Powder; but you shall be satisfied that this has no Re∣lation to <HI>Mercury</HI> of any kind; nor is it Subject to ill Consequence.</P>
<P>TURBITH <HI>Mineral</HI> causes worse Effects: Of this I give none; It weakens, and relaxes the <HI>Medul Spinalis,</HI> or Back Bone Marrow, the Root of the Nerves of the infe∣rior Parts that they cannot receive the Animal Spirits, nor indeed the Impression of the Imagination to push them. Thus defrauded of Spirits, the Stamen of Sense, and Motion, the Muscles of the Loins lose their Action and Strength, more or less.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
<P>OLD Gleets proceed from what the <HI>French</HI> call a Debility, or Laxness of the Vessels, the Emun∣ctory of the <HI>Prostates.</HI> Purging makes the Case worse: Astringents are dangerous. I stop Gleetings of a long standing by tempering the Heat and Ferment of the Hu∣mour, by a Medicine absolutely safe, and pleasant to take.</P>
<P>You will expect that I should give my Opinion of the Seat, or Source of the <HI>Gonorrhaea.</HI> We are commanded to strive for Truth; this obliges me to speak affirma∣tively in Contradiction to a Book on the Hypothesis of the <HI>Lacunae,</HI> and the Patrons of this Theory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of Dr <HI>Cockburn.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>De Verney,</HI> the Gentle∣man already mentioned, shewed an Ulcer in the <HI>Prostates,</HI> of a Man who had this Distemper when he
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>died. I heard him also say, that from thence came the Matter or Discharge in this Case.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Prostates</HI> lie on the de∣pending part of the Bladder near the <HI>Sphincter,</HI> and the Erector Mus∣cles of the <HI>Penis.</HI> The Inflamati∣on, and Swelling of the Ulcer, is soon communicated to those Parts through the porous <HI>Tunicles</HI> of the Bladder, from this it is easy to account for the Heat, the Stoppage, and Strangury of the Urine, also for the Pain and <HI>Cordee</HI> in the Time of Erection.</P>
<P>WHAT I am going to say will cast the Ballance, and determine the Controversy on my Side, absolute∣ly.</P>
<P>IT is manifest that a Discharge of Matter must come from a Wound.
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>Consistent with this Demonstrative Proposition it is found that the Excoriation, or Ulcer of the <HI>Pros∣tates</HI>-Glands is always antecedent to the <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> whereas that of the <HI>Lucanae</HI> does not happen of some time after, sooner, or later, according to the Heat, and Sharp∣ness of the Urine, and of the Run∣ning from the <HI>Prostates,</HI> so the Excoriation or Ulcer of the <HI>Lacunae</HI> can be only an Effect, or Conse∣quence of those Symptoms: I mean that the Heat, and Sharpness of the Urine, and of the vitiated Dis∣charge of the Ulcer in the <HI>Prostates</HI> passing often through the <HI>Urethra</HI> does chafe, and fret the thin and tender Membrane of the <HI>Lacunae,</HI> so occasions an Ulcer, or Excoriati∣on in this Part.</P>
<P>IN a long and great Discharge the <HI>Prostates</HI> are found to waste,
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>and in the End to shrink, and shrivel to almost nothing, while the Excoriation of the <HI>Lacunae</HI> re∣mains without Alteration. These Reasons rise to a Demonstration of my Assertion. The Experiment may soon be made in the Hospi∣tals.</P>
<P>THE Succus or Juice of the <HI>Prostates,</HI> is the Vehicle which conveys the Volatile Semen into the <HI>Uterus.</HI> When this is spent, and the <HI>Prostates</HI> withered, Men become incapable of Procreation, but fertile Nature recovers some, as by a Miracle.</P>
<P>AS in the <HI>Prostates,</HI> a long, and great Discharge of Matter or Nutritious Juice from the <HI>Lacunae</HI> would run sinous the cavernous Body of the <HI>Penis,</HI> and give as little Trouble to cure it.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
<P>WE should find it impractible to restore the Masculine Proportion of the <HI>Penis.</HI></P>
<P>BUT these Accidents do not happen; therefore the Seat of the <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> is not in the <HI>Lacunae.</HI></P>
<P>I was bred in St <HI>Thomas</HI>'s, <HI>Hos∣pital,</HI> under Mr <HI>William Coates∣worth:</HI> After this I was two Years under the celebrated <HI>De Verney</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and in the Hospitals there.</P>
<P>A great Man in Town was my Pupil: Now he is a Physician, he does not scruple to own that he formed himself chiefly on the Ana∣tomy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which I taught him. His Father was a Surgeon of good Account; he chose me to educate his Son preferable to any Man in Town; so he used to say. I have bred several other Surgeons: Some
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>of them are much sought to in set∣ting Bones.</P>
<P>DR <HI>James Keill</HI> was a Gentle∣man no less valued for his Integri∣ty than his Knowledge in Anato∣my; I have inserted a Certificate from him.</P>
<P>TAKE down in Writing three or four remarkable cases in Cure in your Hospital according to the Number and order of your Queries, I will Account for the Appearances from the Fabric, the Function, and Situation of the Parts.</P>
<P>HAVE you a mind to hear something previous: Inquire out a Professor of Anatomy. I will meet him at his appointed Time, and Place, to answer and question him on this Subject. If he thinks fit the controverted Points shall be
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>submitted to the Wardens of Surge∣ons Hall, or to two other Professors, or Physicians, and a third to ad∣judge.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Swelling in your Lady's Throat is what Surgeons call the <HI>Bronchocele,</HI> or <HI>Hernia Gutterii;</HI> but to speak in particular; I say it is a Distention of the Glands <HI>Thyroides.</HI> They are two in Number situated on the opposite Sides of the <HI>Larynx,</HI> and the supe∣rior Part of the <HI>Aspira Arteria</HI> sinking to the flexible Part of the <HI>Anular Cartilages.</HI> The use of these Glands is to strain from the Blood, a vicous glairous Liquor, to lubrify the <HI>Cartilages</HI> of the <HI>Larynx</HI> to facilitate their Motion. They as well as other Glands are greatly subject to cold Defluxions. They are the principal Fountains,
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>and Recervatories of the <HI>Lympha.</HI> Thus we may believe that this cold Humour is also sent thither from the salivary Sources, and other Glands adjacent. It is easy to think that as the <HI>Thyroides</HI> Glands swell, and take up a greater space, they press the flexible part of the <HI>Anular Cartilages</HI> aforesaid, oblig∣ing them to yield; they straiten the <HI>Trachia Arteria:</HI> This occasi∣ons the great Difficulty of Breath∣ing, and threatning of Suffoca∣tion.</P>
<P>ON this principle we render Reason for the loss of her Voice: The Recrurent Nerves suffers a Com∣pression: Animal Spirits are want∣ing in the Muscles to play the Car∣tilages of the <HI>Larynx</HI> to form the Voice. She is worse when with Child, on Account that the Blood and Humours are more determined
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>to the superior Parts, especially in that as the <HI>Abdomen</HI> grows big it presses the <HI>Diaphragma</HI> against the Lungs, so lessens the Capacity of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and hinders Respi∣ration. Parallel to this is the Case of Dropsical People alway opprest with shortness of Breath: I mean in the true Ascites when the low∣er Belly is filled with Water.</P>
<P>THE great Swelling gives Rea∣son to believe that the whole Sub∣stance of these Glands is sapped, and distended with this cold Hu∣mour like a spunge in Water; the sojourn of which has rendered their Texture so extremely lax, that they will not recover their Resort; con∣sequently not admit of cure. Hence it is hard to promise more than to prevent an Extremity; for which if Purging, Bleeding, espe∣sially Sweating, fortifying, dis∣cussing,
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>drying, and corrugating Spirits, with the <HI>Emplastrum, Di∣vinum, Diasulpharis de Ranis,</HI> and <HI>Saponis</HI> spread and embrocat∣ed frequently with <HI>Os Succini redi∣ficati</HI> should not prove effectual one may venture to apply a Caustic on each Side the <HI>Aspira Arteria,</HI> thereby procuring a plentiful Sup∣puration, the Humour may bedrain∣ed, and the Swelling sunk, but remembring that Digestion depends on the sweet Influence of the warm Blood, and Spirits in the Parts, of which in some Sort, this Swelling being deprived, it may be feared that the Wound will languish and ulcerate.</P>

She pushes it through the famous Canal of Com∣munication, called also the Canal Botel, which joins the <HI>Artery</HI> and Vein of the Lungs. There is no more Blood sent into the Substance of the Lungs, than is necessary for their Nourishment.</P>
<P>Without making the Circuit of the Lungs this second Portion of

<P>As the Blood returns to the <HI>Pla∣centa</HI> in the <HI>Umbilical-Artery,</HI> it is absorbed by the Epigastric Vein and brought back to the Heart of the Mother.

<HEAD>An Essay on the Parts of Gene∣ration in Women, and on the Law of Formation, the Pre-existence of the Lineaments in the <HI>Ovum.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Pre-existence of Linea∣ments in the <HI>Ovum,</HI> is the only Hypothesis on this Subject reducible to the mechanical, or geo∣metrical Principle, in which alone is Certainty. Tho' this is new, yet being highly curious and instruc∣tive, the greatest Physicians and Anatomists receive it readily. I shall with a parallel Example de∣scribe it in Terms so easy, and fa∣miliar, chast or seemly, that, with∣out Offence, this with a little At∣tention, or Instruction may in
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>general be understood by the fair Sex: They will see with Pleasure that this concerns them in a high Degree, Child-bearing Women par∣ticularly.</P>
<P>THOSE of our Profession who know most; scruple not to con∣clude and report, that all the Ge∣nerations of Men were lodged in the Loins of <HI>Eve:</HI> The Name sig∣nifies Mother, and is meant the common Mother.</P>
<P>GOD made of One Blood all Nations of Men.</P>
<P>THEY compare the <HI>Ovarium</HI> of a Woman to a Bunch of Grapes, Twelve, Sixteen, Twenty or More in Number. In each of these <HI>Ova,</HI> or Eggs, the Lines or Lineaments of a Male, or Female, all of them, according to the great <HI>Fiat,</HI> are al∣ready
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>ready there. In their Turn as they become the nearest to what they call the Trump, the Head, or Ex∣tremity of the <HI>Tuba Falopiani,</HI> an Apendage of the <HI>Uterus,</HI> the <HI>Ma∣trix,</HI> or Womb, the Eggs become receptive of the Impression of the Semen of the Male in the amorous Congress.</P>
<P>IN the Height of the Caress, the transporting, the rapturous Influence of the Spirits, and of the ardent Semen, darting through the <HI>Tuba,</HI> dresses or distends the Trump. Now like a Hand this does embrace the <HI>Ovun,</HI> so that the volatile, the essential, or spi∣ritous Part of the Semen penetrates, warms, fecunds, enlivens, and de∣termines the Egg to receive pro∣gressive Nourishment from the cir∣culating

<P>THUS the Conception claothed with it's proper Membranes; the <HI>Cho∣rion,</HI> and the <HI>Amnios,</HI> our Vesture in the Womb, and with the <HI>Placenta,</HI> or <HI>Secundine,</HI> all of them of the first Formation growing too big to hang upon the <HI>Ovarium,</HI> wanting also sufficient Nourishment does loosen, and separate.

<P>NOW the Lines, or Lineaments of the Conception begin to unfold, and range by the increasing Blood pushing.</P>
<P>IN This manner the Concepti∣on becomes an <HI>Embryo,</HI> and this a <HI>Foetus</HI> which by Degrees growing to Maturity, and straitened for want of Room, the <HI>Placenta</HI> also separat∣ing, falling away like ripe Fruit, or Leaves from a Tree, the Infant seeks to dislodge: Bearing on the Neck of the Womb, the Weight raises the Throws of Labour.</P>
<P>To prove what they here ad∣vance, Anatomists husk or skin the Seed of a Pine-Tree Apple, then holding it before the Sun they show the Top, the Trunk, and the
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>Root of the Tree which it was to produce.</P>
<P>THIS they take as a Demonstra∣tion of their <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of the Pre-existence of Lineaments in the <HI>Ovum,</HI> on the Plea, that the Law of Formation is general.</P>
<P><HI>Whiston</HI> believes that Generation is nothing but Nutrition, or Aug∣mentation of the Parts; so it is, the <HI>Ovum</HI> being impregnated as aforesaid becomes susceptible of Nutrition, and Growth.</P>
<P>THIS Subject will be improved in Relation to the double Concep∣tion, and the parted <HI>Ovarium.</HI></P>
<P>IN the two foregoing Essays Women will see with singular Satis∣faction
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>the Time, and Manner of their Conception, and all the Al∣terations, and Accidents which do or may happen to them till their Delivery. Seeing that by Means of the <HI>Placenta</HI> the Child does only stick, or cling to the Womb, this may separate, or part by a Fall or other Violence. Perceiving the Danger, Ladies will naturally form to themselves a Regimen, or Man∣ner of Living to prevent Abortion, or Miscarriage.</P>
<P>THEY will no longer believe the imposed Absurdity of bringing a Son, or a Daughter, at their Wish, or Desire.</P>

<P>WAS the Use of the <HI>Curve-Ca∣theter</HI> generally known, and prac∣tised it would in a great Measure set aside the cruel Operation of Cut∣ting for the Stone. Having Re∣course to this Instrument, few would expose to so doubtful an Event.</P>

<P>THE Reverend Mr <HI>John Rich∣ardson,</HI> Preceptor to <HI>Baptist Noel</HI> Earl of <HI>Gainsborough,</HI> was for ma∣ny Years almost incessantly tor∣mented with a Suppression of Urine, and Strangury from a Stone in the Bladder. Sometimes he has staggered about the Room with con∣vulsive Pain.</P>
<P>THE first time that I introducted my <HI>Curve-Catheter</HI> he urined through this Instrument, and the Pain did remit. Next Day I turned a second Time the ragged Stone on the Smooth Part, and his Pain and Provocation went off. Excepting some short Fits of Pain, and Stran∣gury he urined regularly for three Months. In using may <HI>Cathe∣ter</HI> in this Manner <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> Times a Year, he enjoyed a Life of Tranquility for Six Years till

<P>HOW many are tormented with a Suppression of Urine, and Strangury from drinking Stale Beer, or prickt Wine, sometimes an Obstruction happens from an Excrescence in the Neck of the Bladder, or in the <HI>Urethra.</HI> In all which Cases the afflicted may expect.

<P>I glide this Instrument under the <HI>Pubis</HI> into the Bladder, with either Hand from above-below, or below-above, without Pain, or Blood even in fencing with the Stone, if the Passage be not al∣ready excoriated. With this Instru∣ment
