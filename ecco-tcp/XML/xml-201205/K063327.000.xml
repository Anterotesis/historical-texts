<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Publication of the follow∣ing <HI>Lecture,</HI> read by your Com∣mand, is owing in great measure to the Request of several of the <HI>Faculty</HI> and others, who heard it; but chief∣ly to YOUR Desire, which as soon as com∣municated bore with me the Authority of a Command. For HE, who by his OWN La∣bours has brought so much Honour to the Profession in general, has an undoubted Right, I think, to that of every Member in the particular Body of which he is the HEAD. Accordingly I have ventur'd to
<PB REF="5"/>expose it to publick Censure; which from the many Defects in it, I take for granted, will be severe enough: However I dar'd not do even this without first putting it under your Patronage; well knowing that if you pronounce favourably upon it, who from your extensive Knowledge, and large Expe∣rience, are so deservedly eminent, the Gene∣rality will soften their Reflections.</P>
<P>YOU cannot be surpriz'd, Sir, that I should be desirous of Your Protection, if you will but reflect on Your Merit, and the Character You bear in the World. One, who has made ALL NATURE his Study, has outgone the most emulating of his Co∣temporaries both at Home and Abroad, bears such a Sway in the <HI>Physical World,</HI> without caballing for a Reputation, or using the low Methods too frequently taken to raise one, must surely be a desirable Patron: and if this Pittance of a Performance happens to please you as much in the Reading, as it
<PB REF="6"/>to do upon Hearing it, I flatter my self that it will meet with your Approbation.</P>
<P>IN Discourses of this sort much <HI>Novelty</HI> is not to be expected; the Design of them being to set before the Audience in a clear Light and narrow Compass the STATED Rules and ESTABLISH'D Laws of the Science they treat of, as well as to communicate what may have occurr'd to private Observation: If therefore the Description of the Parts is just, their Uses and Powers properly ascertain'd, the Distempers incident to them rightly in∣vestigated, it is sufficient. This will an∣swer the Design of the FOUNDER, which if I have succeeded in, it will be lucky; if any thing is advanc'd besides, that may be of Use to the <HI>Students</HI> of the <HI>Science,</HI> I shall be very well pleas'd; and if the Per∣formance upon the Whole is not so mean as to be a <HI>Disgrace</HI> to that Learned BODY, of which I am a Member, and whose Ho∣nour I hold in the greatest Estimation, I shall be fully satisfy'd.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N pursuance to the Institution of this Lecture, which obliges me to read upon some particular Parts of the Body, and upon two or more Dis∣tempers that are incident to such Parts, I have pitch'd upon those that are form'd for the Separation of the Urine, or are immediately subservient to it afterwards in its Passage out of the Body: which I have taken more out of Necessity than Choice; the most considerable Organs having been treated of already by some of our learned Members, whose Notions and Observations I can't pretend to amend. To this purpose it is necessary, before I enter upon the Diseases that affect them, to give an <HI>Anatomical</HI> Description of the <HI>Ʋrinary Passages,</HI> and to en∣quire into the Nature of the Fluid secreted by them, and flow∣ing through them; as the Knowledge of these will lead us to
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>the <HI>Ʋses</HI> and <HI>Powers</HI> peculiar to each, and thereby inform us in great measure, by what means they become so alter'd and vitiated, as to produce the <HI>Distempers</HI> we shall give an account of: And by such a Method, as I take it, the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>GULSTON.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Founder's</HI> Design will be best answer'd, in ordering this Lecture to be read over a <HI>human Body.</HI></P>
<P>THE first then that are concern'd, and present themselves to our Inspection, are the <HI>Kidneys:</HI> which, as is commonly known, are <HI>situate</HI> in a duplicature of the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> one on each side; the right between the <HI>Liver</HI> and the <HI>Musculus Lumbaris,</HI> or <HI>Psoas;</HI> the left between the <HI>Spleen</HI> and the same Muscle on that side. In human Subjects the Right is plac'd lower than the Left, in order to make more room for the large <HI>Viscus</HI> of the <HI>Liver,</HI> as in Brutes frequently the contrary; not only as the prone Situation of their Bodies does not require such a Position, the Liver in them projecting forwards and downwards, and thence leaving a greater Space for the right Kidney; but because these Animals being very voracious, their Stomachs are often so dis∣tended with Food, that it was necessary to place the left Kid∣ney lower, to prevent its being compress'd by this Organ (toge∣ther with the Spleen) during so great a Distension.</P>
<P>THE Kidneys are <HI>cover'd</HI> with two Coats or Membranes; the exterior of which is borrow'd from the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> and en∣velops them but loosely, generally abounding with Fat; which not only lubricates their Surface, but forms a proper <HI>Nidus,</HI> wherein they lay secure from the pressure and action of the cir∣cumjacent Parts. Their interior or proper Coat is only a Pro∣duction of the outer Integument of the Blood-Vessels, for which reason it adheres closely to their Surface; tho not so firmly, but it may be separated from it, without any considerable Lace∣ration of their Substance.</P>
<P>THEY are <HI>connected</HI> to different Parts, in order either to keep them in their just Situation, or to communicate their proper Fluids to each other. The <HI>Tunica adiposa</HI> strongly affixes them
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>to the Loins, and prevents their falling down into the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> which wou'd occasion the sides of the emulgent Vessels to collapse at their Orifices next the great Blood-Vessels, and thereby take off any Communication between them and the Kidneys. As a farther Security, the Right is sometimes connected to the Liver, sometimes to the <HI>Intestinum caecum,</HI> and the left to the <HI>Colon</HI> and <HI>Spleen.</HI> They communicate with the <HI>Aorta</HI> and <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> by means of the <HI>Emulgents,</HI> and <HI>Arteria,</HI> and <HI>Vena adiposa,</HI> and have a near Relation to the Bladder by means of the <HI>Ʋreters.</HI></P>
<P>THEY have <HI>Nerves</HI> from the Intercostals and spinal Marrow, which together form the <HI>Plexus Renalis,</HI> though very few in number, and their Twigs very small; seeming only design'd to be subservient to the other Vessels that are immediately employ'd in the Secretion of Urine: but they are pretty plentifully stock'd with <HI>Lymphaticks;</HI> some of which coming out of their <HI>con∣cave</HI> Side, and making several Anastomoses in various places, are at lengh inserted into a Gland in human Bodies, and thence carry the Lymph to the <HI>Receptaculum Chyli;</HI> whilst others arising from their <HI>gibbose</HI> Side, form a double Trunk: one of which creeping upwards, the other downwards along their Back, and both making a Flexure towards the Emulgent Vessels, terminate likewise in a Gland, and thence proceed to the same Receptacle. These Lymphaticks spring from so minute an Ori∣gin, that it escapes the Eye, though assisted by the best Micro∣scope, which has occasion'd variety of Conjectures concerning them: But <HI>Nuck</HI>'s Experiments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nuckii adenographia, cap. 6. p. 61.</NOTE>, from whom I have taken this Account, (not being able my self to trace their Beginning) have taught us, that they arise from the Capillary Branches of the Emulgent Arterties: for by blowing into this Artery, the <HI>Flatus</HI> easily pass'd into these <HI>Ducts,</HI> and distended them. As this Experiment demonstrates the Communication between these Vessels, it at the same time gives us an insight into the use of the <HI>Lymphaticks</HI> of these Parts; which is to receive and carry off the <HI>Lymph</HI> from the Blood brought for the Nourishment of the Kidney, as the Urinary Tubes receive the excrementitious Parts, or the Urine.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
<P>WE come now to the <HI>Body</HI> of the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> whose external Superficies in <HI>Adults</HI> is uniform and even, but in <HI>Infants</HI> rough and unequal, being divided as it were into distinct Lobes; which has made several imagine the <HI>Kidney</HI> to be compos'd of a Number of conglomerate Glands: but its <HI>inward Structure</HI> has occasion'd a great Variety of Opinions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Aristotle, Galen, Vesalius, Fallopius, Highmore, Veslingius, Bartholin.</NOTE> suitable to the Philosophy in vogue at the Time the Authors wrote concerning them: To examine which is now altogether needless, because the modern Improvements in Anatomy have demonstrated them to be so many Fictions of learned Men. It will however be worth while to take notice, that the great <HI>Hippocrates</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. de glandulis.</NOTE> observing the Matter contain'd in the Glands to be White, and resembling Phlegm or <HI>Pituita,</HI> ascribes a Use to them of receiving any re∣dundancy of Moisture in the Body, which by the peculiar spon∣giness of their Substance they attract; and accordingly tells us, that the <HI>Kidneys</HI> abounding with much Humidity have <HI>Glands,</HI> and these larger than in any other Part. From this Description of the largeness of these Glands, it is certain <HI>Hippocrates</HI> did not say this from observing the inward Structure of the Kid∣neys, but from reflecting on the Quantity of Urine proceeding from them; which, according to his Notion, must have Glands proportionably large to attract and percolate it. But however, what he concluded from his penetrating Sagacity laid a good Foundation for farther Anatomical Inquiries into their Make; which it is a wonder were attended for so many Ages after him with so little Success, excepting only by <HI>Aretaeus,</HI> who says the same thing<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. de Causis, &amp;c. Auctorum Morborum, cap. 3. Id. diutur∣norum morb. cap. 4.</NOTE>. And indeed I must say thus much for the honour of this <HI>great Father of Physick,</HI> (tho it has been endeavour'd to make us believe the contrary) that even in this <HI>knowing Age</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Blackmore<HI>'s Preface to his Essay on the Small-Pox.</HI></NOTE> whoever will take the pains to read him, and has the proper Requisites to understand him, will find <HI>Gains worthy of his Labour,</HI> and <HI>upon many Accounts be∣come the better Physician for it.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<P>THE first Author, who gives a Description of all the consti∣tuent Parts of the <HI>Kidney,</HI> that comes near the Fact, is <HI>Bar∣tholomaeus Eustachius,</HI> a Scholar and Cotemporary of <HI>Vesalius.</HI> He observes, that in some Animals, as Bulls, Bears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Kidneys</HI> have <HI>Glands,</HI> which appear very conspicuous, both in the exterior and interior part of them: but that in human Bodies these glandulous Substances are found in the inmost part of the <HI>Kidney</HI> only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Renum structura, cap. 2.</NOTE>, and are plac'd in that particular part of it, where the Branches of the <HI>Ʋreter</HI> terminate, covering the ex∣tremity of each Branch; which Glands being divided length∣ways, certain Furrows or little Channels may be perceiv'd, like so many small Hairs, thro' which he does not doubt, but that the Urine percolates<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. cap. 7.</NOTE>. This Account has a very near Resem∣blance of their real Structure: but at the same time it proves, that he mistook the <HI>Carunculae Papillares</HI> for Glands, as he did the Interstices between the Urinary Ducts for Channels to convey the <HI>Ʋrine;</HI> for he does not admit of any Tubes for this purpose: but in opposition to some, who imagin'd these small Filaments might be so many minute Vessels, he gives it as <HI>his</HI> Opinion, that they are only Furrows elegantly engrav'd in the Substance of the Kidney<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. cap. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE Mistakes are rectify'd by <HI>Bellini,</HI> who was the first Discoverer of the <HI>Ʋrinary Ducts;</HI> (though very likely the former Author gave him the Hint) and has also shewn from whence they spring, and how they are propagated<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">De structurâ Ren. p. 19.</NOTE>. From what has been wrote by him, and from reiterated Inspections and Ex∣periments since his Time, it appears, that the Substance of the <HI>Kidney</HI> is only a Congeries of Blood-Vessels and Excretory Ducts wrapt up in one common Covering:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tab.</HI> I.</NOTE> for the <HI>Emulgent Artery,</HI> which goes off from the Trunk of the <HI>Aorta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ig</HI> I.</NOTE> in its Progress toward the Kidney divides first into two Branches, and these again into two, three, and sometimes four more, which pierce the concave Side of it; when they immediately disperse themselves between the Coats of the <HI>Pelvis.</HI> These at their <HI>exit</HI> from hence, send off smaller Branches; which being incurvated, and meeting each other, form several <HI>Anastomoses.</HI> From these,
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>towards the <HI>gibbose</HI> part of the <HI>Kidney,</HI> arise still more minute Ramifications, which are propagated to the outer Superficies, and by their different Convolutions and Contortions there form a sort of Net-work,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> II.</NOTE> not unlike a Ball of Silk; but before their ultimate Branches lose their form, and assume that of <HI>Excretory Ducts,</HI> they change their circular Progress into a serpentine one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ruysch. Thesaur. 6. <HI>p.</HI> 13.</NOTE>. From the Extremities of these capillary arterial Branches arise the <HI>Veins,</HI> which being divided into the like Ramifications (tho differently modify'd) are inclos'd in one common <HI>Capsula</HI> with the Artery, and accompany it throughout the whole Kidney, going out where the Artery enters, and terminating in the <HI>Cava.</HI> In some Brutes of the Cat-kind this Vein is differently dispos'd: for instead of accompanying the Artery within the Kidney, it propagates its Branches upon the <HI>Surface,</HI> as you may see in some very curious Preparations of Mr. <HI>Ranby</HI>'s here given.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> V.</NOTE></P>
<P>NEXT within these appears a Number of small Filaments, which look like <HI>fleshy</HI> Fibres, but are really <HI>membranous</HI> and <HI>hollow,</HI> and agree with other excretory Ducts both in Sub∣stance and Use. These were first found out by <HI>Bellini,</HI> and are therefore call'd <HI>Tubuli Belliniani:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> III.</NOTE> They seem so spring from the Sides of the Capillary Arteries, and extending them∣selves in a right Line towards the Centre or <HI>Pelvis</HI> of the Kidney, are collected at their Extremities into twelve Classes, and form the <HI>Papillae,</HI> which are nothing else but the Endings of these Ducts so collected together, and not <HI>Glands,</HI> as <HI>Eu∣stachius</HI> suppos'd. The remaining part of the Kidney is pos∣sess'd by a Dilatation of the <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> which forms the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> and then sends off twelve Branches call'd <HI>Fistulae Membranaceae,</HI> which join the <HI>Papillae,</HI> and have Fat interspers'd between each of them for the Lubrication of their Substance.</P>
<P>THIS Disposition and Communication of the Vessels in the Kidneys easily appears, by blowing into the Emulgent Artery, or injecting a colour'd Liquor into it, which will not only very much distend the whole, but will pass into the Emulgent Veins, the Tubes just mention'd, and sometimes the <HI>Ʋreter</HI> it self.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
<P>BUT besides this aggregate of Vessels, the accurate <HI>Malpighius</HI> has observ'd a considerable Number of exceeding small Bodies, of a round Figure like the Eggs of Fish, which are annex'd to the ends of the Arteries, and plac'd between them and the <HI>Tubuli Ʋrinarii;</HI> to the last of which they are likewise join'd by their proper Excretory Ducts, and correspond to them in Number; and which upon filling the Emulgent Artery with Ink, will also, he says, appear ting'd with it, and their Adhesion to the Capil∣lary Branches thereby discover'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Renibus, cap. 3.</NOTE>. This has occasion'd Anato∣mists to differ about the Structure of this Part of the <HI>Kidney: Malpighius</HI> will have these Appearances to be distinct <HI>Glands,</HI> and the immediate Instruments of the Secretion of Urine.</P>
<P>THE curious Dr. <HI>Ruysch</HI> absolutely denies that there are any such Vesicular Bodies in this Part, and confirms his Judgment by repeated Injections, which discover'd the immediate conti∣nuity of the Arteries and Urinary Ducts without any inter∣vening Substance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Thesaur. 2. pag. 64, 65.</NOTE>: He acknowledges indeed to have observ'd certain round diaphanous Bodies in the middle of the Kidney, but they were not in number sufficient to answer the Ends as∣sign'd<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. pag. 65.</NOTE>; and even these vanish'd upon Injection, and consequent∣ly could not be Glands<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Thesaur. 1. p. 35, 58.</NOTE>. The Question between them then is not whether there are <HI>Glands</HI> in the Kidney, for they both al∣low that; but concerning the intimate Structure of that par∣ticular Part of them, which is the immediate <HI>separating Organ:</HI> The one being of opinion that the Blood is alter'd, or in other words, the Urine is secreted in these membranous Follicles, which afterwards empty themselves thro' their own proper Excretory Ducts into those of <HI>Bellini:</HI> The other, that there are none such; and if there were, yet that they are not distinct Glands, but that the Percolation is simply made by the Orifi∣ces of the <HI>Bellinian</HI> Ducts themselves.</P>
<P>IF it be lawful in <HI>this Place</HI> to enter into the nicer Parts of A∣natomy, we may observe, that Dr. <HI>Ruysch</HI>'s Assertions are very much confirm'd by several Preparations of this Part; in which
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>the spherical Bodies that seem'd to be so many Glands before they were injected, appear after it to be only the Convolutions of the Capillary Branches of the Emulgent Artery, which the injected Liquor subtilly permeates, and passes directly thence into the <HI>Tubuli Ʋrinarii.</HI> This is more easily seen in the Kidneys of Infants, which are the properest for this purpose, because they are of a looser Contexture, and divided in a man∣ner into Clusters of Glands; so that if these membranous Folli∣cles would appear at all, they would in such Subjects. Whe∣ther, as some will have it, the Injection at the same time it fills these <HI>Vesiculae,</HI> does not introduce such a Confusion, by en∣larging their Dimensions, and making them press against one another on all Sides, that the exceeding thin Membranes which compose them can't be distinguish'd from the injected Matter it self, is not so easy absolutely to be determin'd; nor whether from the Distension it makes in the Vessel it flows thro', it may not compress such others as lie contiguous and are not in∣jected; at the same time it makes the one visible, totally ob∣literating the other: but it is not likely that it produces such Effects, because in other Preparations of this sort, we find that it discovers the natural Contexture of the Part, which renders Dr. <HI>Ruysch</HI>'s Notion more certain and probable.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, admitting there are such membranous Blad∣ders where <HI>Malpighius</HI> has plac'd them, which the Favourers of this Assertion strenuously contend for, from the regular Appear∣ances in his different Experiments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malpighii Epist. ad Spon. p. 25.</NOTE>, and from other Observa∣tions of their own, especially upon morbid Kidneys, in which they have been found pretty large and turgid with Urine, when the Urinary Ducts have been obstructed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Memoires d' Academie des Sciences; Ann. 1705. p. 40.</NOTE>; yet that they are <HI>distinct Glands,</HI> and the proper <HI>secretory Organs</HI> of the <HI>Ʋrine,</HI> is no way agreeable to Nature in other Parts of the like kind; because where-ever we find these Follicles with their own pro∣per investing Membranes and Excretory Ducts, they don't per∣form the Office of a Gland, but are only <HI>Appendages</HI> of it,
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>or Receptacles to contain the Fluid already separated by the Gland, till it is proper to discharge it into some common Outlet, analogous to the <HI>Vesiculae Seminales, Gall-Bladder,</HI> and such like. And by the way, in this consists one Difference in the Composition of the Glands of the Body: that those Glands which secrete a Liquor, that is afterwards to be discharg'd from them at <HI>distant Intervals,</HI> as occasions require, are furnish'd with these membranous Follicles, into which the separating Canal empties its Contents, which are reserv'd there for that pur∣pose; such are the <HI>Mamillary Glands,</HI> those of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Guts,</HI> and several other in different Parts of the Body: As on the contrary, those Glands which separate a Fluid that is <HI>conti∣nually</HI> to flow from them to some other Part, have no such Pro∣vision within their Substance, neither do they want it; of which sort are the <HI>Brain,</HI> the <HI>Testicles,</HI> several of the Conglomerate kind, and the <HI>Kidneys.</HI> This Distinction founded upon the strictest Inquiries, may in some degree decide the Controversy now depending between Anatomists concerning the peculiar Make of these Bodies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rhaave</HI> de Fabricâ Glandularum.</NOTE>; for both are in the right, when they confine their Assertions to <HI>particular</HI> Glands, as they both err, when they expend them to the whole <HI>Genus.</HI> But to return,</P>
<P>THE remaining part of the Kidneys, as before observ'd, is possess'd by a Dilatation of the <HI>Ʋreters,</HI> which make the <HI>Pelvis;</HI> these at their <HI>exit</HI> from hence contract their Dimen∣sions, and form each of them a small <HI>Tube,</HI> which runs with a tortuous inflexion to the Bladder.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> V.</NOTE> They are naturally of the bigness of a Goose-Quill; but are capable of being distended to a much greater Size, as is evident in some calculous Cases; of which sort I have seen two remarkable Instances, where their Orifices were so enlarg'd, that upon injecting the Bladder, in order to perform the high Operation of Cutting for the Stone, the Water pass'd into the very <HI>Pelvis</HI> of the Kidney, so that the Bladder was never distended, which appear'd to be the Case upon Dissection. They are of unequal Diameters in different parts of them, being contracted and dilated alternately through∣out their whole len<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, and not in that <HI>single</HI> part only, where
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>they descend over the <HI>Iliack Arteries,</HI> according to the com∣mon Opinion. This appears by making a Ligature at one end of the <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> and after having inflated it, closing the other Extre∣mity, and letting it dry. Hence <HI>Morgagni</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adversar. 2. Animadvers. 47.</NOTE> rightly infers, that this alternate Contraction and Dilatation proceeds from their natural Conformation; to which I may add for a particular Design too, which will presently appear, and not only because their Sides are compress'd by the Pulsation of the <HI>Iliack Ar∣teries,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Cowper</HI> assigns as the sole Cause of this Ine∣quality of their Dimensions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cowpen</HI>'s Appendix, <HI>Tab.</HI> IV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY are compos'd of three <HI>Coats,</HI> which make them more than ordinary thick in proportion to the Space they enclose, and enable them the better to resist the weight of the distend∣ed Intestines, (and in Women the <HI>Ʋterus</HI> likewise) which might otherwise so compress them, as to hinder the Transflux of Urine. Anatomists particularly describe the Substance of these Coats, and call the outer <HI>Membranous,</HI> the middle <HI>Muscular,</HI> and the innermost Nervous: but upon the nicest Inspection, there is no such Distinction appears, but the whole seems to be a thick nervous Membrane; in the inside of which are plac'd divers small Glands that emit a <HI>Mucus</HI> to guard them from the Salts of the Urine.</P>
<P>THEY are inserted into the Bladder very obliquely, after ha∣ving pass'd about a Finger's breadth between its Coats, and are remarkably contracted at the Place of their opening into it. They are furnish'd with Arteries and Veins from the Trunks of the <HI>Aorta</HI> and <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> and have Nerves from the Inter∣costals and spinal Marrow; which last render them extremely sensible, and occasion that excessive Pain upon any forcible Dis∣tention.</P>
<P>IN the common Course of Nature there is only <HI>one Ʋreter</HI> to each Kidney; but sometimes she furnishes both of them with <HI>two,</HI> when unavoidable Necessity requires such a Deviation from her general Rules. <HI>Double Ʋreters</HI> have been often observ'd,
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>but seldom to <HI>both</HI> Kidneys, as in the Preparation following;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tab.</HI> II.</NOTE> in which may be observ'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> I.</NOTE> that there are <HI>two Ʋreters</HI> arising distinctly, the one above the Emulgent Vessels, the other below them, which running separately almost, their whole Course, are at length conjoin'd just at their penetrating the outward Coat of the Bladder, and there forming one <HI>Tube</HI> terminate in a single Orifice as usual.</P>
<P>SUCH an extraordinary Provision in this Subject was abso∣lutely necessary from the uncommon Structure of the Kidneys; in which the <HI>Fistulae Membranaceae</HI> do not discharge themselves into one common <HI>Pelvis,</HI> but into <HI>two</HI> distinct ones; which not communicating with each other, but being separated by the Sub∣stance of the Kidney, it was requisite that <HI>each</HI> should be fur∣nish'd with its proper <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> to carry off the Urine sent into it.</P>
<P>WE come now to the grand Receptacle of the Urine, the <HI>Bladder.</HI> This is situate in the <HI>Pelvis</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> be∣tween a Duplicature of the <HI>Peritonaeum;</HI> the outer <HI>Lamella</HI> covering its fore-part, the inner passing over its <HI>Fundus,</HI> and covering the hinder: It is compos'd of three Coats; the outer is a Covering of the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> the middle is Muscular, and made up partly of Longitudinal, and partly of Fibres vari∣ously intersecting each other. The inner is Nervous, in which are plac'd several Glands that separate an unctuous Matter to defend it from the Acrimony of the Urine. This Coat is ca∣pable of very great Distention; but not having a Power of con∣tracting its Dimensions as the two others have, it is therefore, when not distended, and the Bladder empty, corrugated in se∣veral places.</P>
<P>THE middle Coat is plac'd by Anatomists among the Muscles,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tab.</HI> III. <HI>Fig.</HI> I.</NOTE> and nam'd <HI>Detrusor Ʋrinae</HI> from its Office; but it is not easy to apprehend how the Contraction of this Muscle should pro∣duce such an Effect as it is commonly describ'd; since its Longi∣tudinal Fibres having no fix'd Point whence they spring, but terminating at each end in the lower Orifice of the Bladder, they would rather pull up the Neck of it when they contract
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> I. II.</NOTE> than bring the <HI>Fundus</HI> downwards. Dr. <HI>Douglas,</HI> among his other curious Preparations of this Part, has one which gives us a <HI>different,</HI> but the <HI>true</HI> Disposition of these Longitudi∣nal Fibres; whence he found, that they arise from the inner and lower part of the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> and the fore part of the <HI>Prostata,</HI> and passing from thence over the <HI>Fundus</HI> of the Bladder, come down the hinder part of it, and are inserted into the back part of this Gland: and that these Fibres are rang'd in the manner that accurate Anatomist has describ'd, the two annex'd Prepa∣rations plainly shew, which have been made for that purpose since his communicating this his Discovery to me; for which I take this Opportunity publickly to return him Thanks, as well as for several others, that are well worthy Observation, and when he thinks proper to oblige the Publick with them, will appear very much to his Honour. Analogous to the <HI>Prostata,</HI> in Women, is the <HI>Vagina Ʋteri,</HI> in which the Fibres terminate. As this Muscle is so dispos'd, we easily see that by its Contrac∣tion the <HI>Fundus</HI> of the <HI>Bladder</HI> will be pull'd forwards and downwards towards the <HI>Os Pubis</HI> by the Longitudinal Fibres, at the same time that the Oblique ones lessen its Dimensions, and so both together will exclude the Urine.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Bladder</HI> has three Orifices; one External for the <HI>exit</HI> of the Urine, and two Internal for its <HI>Admission,</HI> where the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> open into it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> III.</NOTE> From each of these latter <HI>Morgagni</HI> has observ'd in both Sexes, that there proceeds a small but pretty thick and compact <HI>fleshy Body,</HI> which passing from the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> obliquely downwards on the back part of the Bladder, and being somewhat Protuberant within its Neck joins its Fellow, and both together make an Angle at their Juncture; from whence in Males a Line is extended downwards as far as the <HI>Caput Gallinaginis.</HI> These Bodies he takes to be a <HI>Production</HI> of the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> themselves, and with very good reason; for by depressing them with your Fingers, the Mouths of the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> contract and are clos'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adversar. 1. <HI>Pag.</HI> 5.</NOTE>. The <HI>Bladder</HI> is divided into two Parts, the <HI>Fundus</HI> and the <HI>Neck;</HI> the former of which is the larger
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>Part, which rests upon the <HI>Intestinum Rectum</HI> in Men; but in Women upon the <HI>Vagina Ʋteri:</HI> The Neck is the smaller, which is much more contracted, and longer in Men than in that Sex. At the bottom of this is plac'd a small Muscle of circular Fibres, call'd the <HI>Sphincter,</HI> which prevents the involuntary Emission of Urine.</P>
<P>THE Neck of the Bladder is fix'd behind to the <HI>Rec∣tum</HI> in Men, in Women to the <HI>Vagina;</HI> and before in both to the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> by means of the <HI>Peritonaeum.</HI> Its <HI>Fundus</HI> is ty'd above to the Navel by the <HI>Ʋrachus,</HI> degenerated into a Ligament. But besides this Connexion to these different Parts, Dr. <HI>Bohn,</HI> a Professor of <HI>Leipswick</HI> near fifty Years ago, ob∣serv'd another particular Adhesion of the <HI>Bladder;</HI> which is, that the greater part of the <HI>Fundus</HI> in human Bodies, adheres to or is continuous on the fore-part of it to the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> and Muscles of the <HI>Abdomen;</HI> and upon this Consideration, and be∣cause this Part of the Bladder is not <HI>merely Membranous,</HI> but <HI>Muscular</HI> also throughout its whole extent, he admonishes us not at all to despair of Wounds made in it; inasmuch as the <HI>Mus∣cles, Peritonaeum</HI> and <HI>Bladder,</HI> being thus continuous to each other, their Fibres will grow together, and all of 'em unite in one common <HI>Cicatrix,</HI> provided proper Care is taken in the Dressing, and the Wound not dilated with Tents, as he and the Surgeons attending observ'd in a Student about six Years before<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">OEconom.

<P>ADJOINING to the Neck of the Bladder is the <HI>Ʋrethra,</HI> which in Men makes a Curvature of about four Inches in length under the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> and is extended underneath and between the <HI>Corpora Cavernosa Penis</HI> to the end of the <HI>Glands.</HI> Its Sub∣stance is partly spongious, and partly nervous; but as it relates to the Emission of Urine, in which Circumstance only we con∣sider it here; we need only take notice of its <HI>inward</HI> Mem∣brane.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> IV.</NOTE> This is extremely soft, and of exquisite Sense. The upper part of it is perforated in several Places by the Mouths of several small <HI>Ducts</HI> which lye immediately upon it, and run length-ways; commencing about a Thumb's breadth from the <HI>Glans,</HI> and ending about the breadth of seven or eight Inches from it. These Ducts probably come from some small Glands plac'd within the Body of the <HI>Ʋrethra;</HI> and the Liquor they separate is the same Colour and Consistence with that separated by Mr. <HI>Cowper</HI>'s Glands, though the Use of it seems rather to defend the Cavity of the <HI>Ʋrethra</HI> from the sharpness of the Urine than to lubricate it for the freer Passage of the Seed, (which is the principal Office of the others) because the same are found in the <HI>Ʋrethra</HI> of Women (over and above the <HI>Lacunae</HI>) where they can contribute nothing in <HI>Coitu.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Ʋrethra</HI> is likewise furnish'd with a Muscle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> V.</NOTE> which is serviceable to it as a Urinary Vessel, and call'd from its Office <HI>Accelerator Ʋrinae.</HI> This arises fleshy from the upper Part of the <HI>Ʋrethra</HI> on both sides as it passes under the <HI>Ossa Pubis,</HI> and encompassing the Bulb meets on its inferior Part; where having run along a little way in the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> it divides its self, and makes two tendinous Insertions into the sides of the <HI>Corpora Cavernosa Penis.</HI></P>

<P>BEFORE we finish this Section, it will be proper to take notice of the <HI>Glandulae Renales;</HI> because most Anatomists have fancy'd that they contribute something to the Kidneys in perform∣ing their Office; for they are situate so near each other, that the Membranes which invest them both externally are connected very fast together, and in a <HI>Foetus</HI> these Bodies lye so contiguous, that they seem at first Sight to be the same. These Glands are about an Inch broad and two long, but much bigger proportionably in Children; and in a <HI>Foetus</HI> near as big as the Kidneys themselves, but they don't increase in proportion with other Parts. Within they have a pretty large <HI>Sinus,</HI> which the late Dr. <HI>Tyson,</HI> by blowing into, found to empty themselves into two Veins; where∣of the Right pass'd immediately into the <HI>Cava,</HI> the Left into the <HI>Emulgent</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 142.</NOTE>. They have Arteries from the <HI>Emulgents,</HI> some∣times from the <HI>Aorta</HI> itself, but their <HI>Excretory</HI> Ducts could never be found, and therefore the Use of these Glands has not been ascertain'd, till very lately <HI>Valsalva</HI> observ'd them, which he says descend to the <HI>Testicles</HI> in Men; but in Women are sent to the <HI>Ovaria,</HI> and are therefore instrumental in Generation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id.

However Mr. <HI>Ranby</HI> has discover'd, instead of them, two <HI>Spermatick Arte∣ries</HI> never taken notice of before, which very probably are what <HI>Valsalva</HI> took for <HI>Excretory Ducts</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id.

These Arteries are near as big as the Seminal. That on the right springs from the <HI>Aorta,</HI> about a Finger's breadth above the Seminal, first sending off a large Branch to the <HI>Glandula Renalis,</HI> and then another, which being en∣clos'd in the same common <HI>Capsula</HI> with the <HI>Spermatick Ar∣tery</HI> and <HI>Vein,</HI> descends along with them to the <HI>Testicle.</HI> That on the Left is propagated in the same manner, only sometimes
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>it arises from the <HI>Aorta,</HI> sometimes from the <HI>Emulgent.</HI> But not∣withstanding this Discovery, we are still as much at a Loss for the Use of these Glands as ever: for though these Arteries distribute a Branch both to them and the <HI>Testicles,</HI> yet there is nothing communicated from one to the other upon that account; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they separate a Liquor for diluting the Venal Blood, which is too thick after its being robb'd of its aqueous Parts by the Filter of the Kidneys, as is the Opinion of some, does not ap∣pear altogether rational; for if this was their Office, why are they so very large in a <HI>Foetus</HI> where there is so little Urine se∣creted? What <HI>Morgagni</HI> hints upon this Subject appears much more probable; that they are <HI>Lymphatick Glands,</HI> and of the same Nature with those plac'd near the <HI>Receptaclum Chyli,</HI> and the beginning of the <HI>Thoracick Duct:</HI> Namely, continually to pour forth a Liquor through their <HI>Lymphatick Vessels,</HI> in order either to dilute the <HI>Chyle,</HI> or to keep open and lubricate the Pas∣sages; and this may agree with their extraordinary Bulk in <HI>Foe∣tuses,</HI> since in them there is either no <HI>Chyle,</HI> and therefore a greater Quantity of <HI>Lymph</HI> is necessary to keep these <HI>Viae Lacteae</HI> open; or if there is, it is in so small a Quantity, and at the same time not acted upon by the <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> that more <HI>Lymph</HI> is requir'd to carry it through these Ducts into the <HI>Subclavian Vein</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Adversar. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><SUP>o</SUP>.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Of the Uses and Powers of the Urinary Organs.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E come now to inquire into the Uses of the Or∣gans describ'd, and into the Powers with which they respectively act upon the Fluids that pass through their Cavities. That the general Use of them is to separate the Urine from the Blood, and to promote its Passage afterwards out of the Body, appears <HI>primâ facie,</HI> upon dissecting these several Parts: but the Manner how this Separation is perform'd has been very little understood by all the antient Writers, as well as by many of the more mo∣dern ones, which has occasion'd this Action to be attributed to different Causes. As, that the Urine was secreted from the Blood by means of <HI>Digestion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Van Helmont.</NOTE>; that the aqueous <HI>Serum</HI> was <HI>precipi∣tated</HI> from the <HI>Cruor</HI> by a peculiar <HI>Ferment</HI> residing in the Kid∣neys<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sylvii Praxis Med. lib. 1. cap. 55. Du Hamel de Affect. Corpor. lib. 2. cap. 3.</NOTE>; that the Blood was dispos'd to part with its Serosity by a Ferment that put it into <HI>Fusion</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willis. Pharmaceut. Part. 1. Sect. 4. cap. 3.</NOTE>, and that the Kidneys sepa∣rated the aqueous Parts from the rest by an <HI>attractive</HI> Power inherent in their Substance<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Galen de usu Part. lib. 5. cap. 6, &amp; 7.</NOTE>: the bare Recital of which in this Age is sufficient to shew, that they have no Existence in this part of the Animal OEconomy.</P>
<P>IT will not however be amiss, before we explain the Nature of this Secretion, to premise, that <HI>Bellini</HI> and <HI>Professor Boer∣haave,</HI> though both of them reject these Hypotheses, have not∣withstanding fallen into a Mistake about this Affair; for the first
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>imagines, that the Blood, when arriv'd at the Extremities of the Emulgent Arteries, is <HI>extravasated</HI> through their patent Orifices into a <HI>small Space</HI> that lays between them, and the Origination of the <HI>Tubuli Ʋrinarii</HI> and Emulgent Veins; the former re∣ceiving the urinous Parts, the latter the refluent Blood by means of the <HI>different Configuration</HI> of their Orifices: whereas it is not only evident to Sense, from <HI>injecting</HI> the Kidney, that the Urinary Ducts spring <HI>immediately</HI> from the extreme Branches of of the Artery; but it is demonstrable likewise from the Nature of Fluids, that the Orifices of these Vessels cannot be different in Figure; because the Pressure of all Liquors being constantly perpendicular to the Sides of the containing Vessels, these will hereby be every where distended equally, that is, they must be Circular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bellini de Structurâ Renum pag. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Blood indeed is previously dispos'd for a particular Secretion by the peculiar Attrition of its Parts, and the Pressure it undergoes in the various Complications and Contor∣tions of the <HI>Arteriolae</HI> of the Gland; whereby it is determin'd to part with such Particles as are adapted to the Orifices of of the secerning Canals, which will be imping'd upon them with a certain Velocity; and as these Complications and Contor∣tions are vastly different in different Glands, there will hence arise a Variety of Secretions in these Bodies: but that the Orifices of the Secretory Ducts must be <HI>Circular,</HI> (though their Dimensions differ in different Glands) is evident from the ne∣cessary Effects of Fluids upon yielding Vessels, as they run through them. And by the way, the whole Doctrine of Secre∣tion depends upon the <HI>particular Contexture</HI> and <HI>Disposition</HI> of the Arterial Branches of the Gland, the Velocity with which the Blood is imping'd upon the Orifices of the separating Canals, and the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Orifices themselves.</P>
<P>THE <HI>last Author</HI> has err'd, by concluding, that the Secretion of the Urine is perform'd two ways; the one more simple, by the immediate Percolation of the Urinous Parts through the <HI>Bel∣linian
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>Ducts;</HI> the other more complex'd, by the Assistance of <HI>distinct Glands:</HI> whereas there are no such Bodies, in his Sense of that word, to be found in the Kidneys<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boerhavei Institut. N<SUP>o</SUP> 353.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Separation of this Liquor then from the Blood is per∣form'd by a very simple piece of Mechanism, arising only from the Structure of the Kidneys, and some Properties of the Blood circulating through them. For from the Description of the con∣stituent Parts of these Organs already given, it appears, that the Blood by the Force of the Heart is propell'd through the vari∣ous Ramifications and Convolutions of the Emulgent Arteries, till it comes to the Orifices of the <HI>Bellinian Ducts,</HI> which are the separating Canals; but these not being capable from the small∣ness of their Diameters, of admitting the whole heterogeneous Mass, but only such Parts of it as are proportionate to them, these only will be receiv'd, whilst the grosser Compound will cir∣culate through the more patent Originations of the <HI>Emulgent Veins,</HI> to be return'd by them into the <HI>Vena Cava.</HI> Now the <HI>aqueous</HI> part of the Blood consisting of much the smallest Par∣ticles of it, and the <HI>Salts</HI> of the Blood having a close Union with the watery Part, as being dissolv'd in it, these will first pass through the Orifices of the Secretory Vessels, and the se∣cern'd Fluid will consequently for the most part consist of these Principles; which that the Urine does, will presently appear.</P>
<P>THE Urine thus separated, flows through these Ducts to the <HI>Papillae,</HI> and is discharg'd by them into the <HI>Fistulae Mebranaceae,</HI> which convey it to the <HI>Pelvis.</HI> This Cavity, though different from what Nature practises in other glandulous Parts, the Ex∣cretory Ducts of such generally terminating in one large common Duct without any Cavity interpos'd, yet is absolutely necessary from the <HI>Figure</HI> of the Kidney; for this making a considerable Segment of a Circle, in which the Urinary Tubes are propagated in great numbers from the Circumference towards the Centre, if they had open'd there at once in a Duct of a <HI>small</HI> Diameter, their Orifices would have been brought so close to one another,
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>and with Directions so opposite, as necessarily to have hinder'd several of them from discharging their Contents, or at best have render'd such Discharge very irregular; which is prevented by this <HI>Basin,</HI> whereby their Orifices are remov'd farther from the Centre and one another, and the Discharge render'd thereby equal and uniform.</P>
<P>FROM hence the Urine descends through the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> into the <HI>Bladder;</HI> but whether by its own Gravity, or whether it is forwarded in its Course by the Action of these Tubes, has not yet been determin'd. Some<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verheyen Anatom. Tractat. 2. cap. 18. Dionis Anatom. Demonstrat. 3.</NOTE> Anatomists of great Note have in∣ferr'd, from the substance and disposition of their investing Coats, that they are not merely passive, and barely afford a Passage to the Urine, but that they are endu'd with a sort of <HI>Pe∣ristaltick</HI> Motion, which promotes its Descent into the Bladder. In Brutes indeed this Action of the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> seems somewhat needful, by reason of the Horizontal Situation of their Bodies, the Urine not flowing downwards as in Men, and consequently its Weight contributing little or nothing to its Motion; but in Men there is no such Necessity for this Action, because the Urine will descend of course from the erect Position of these Tubes. On the other hand, I am apt to think, that the Course of the Urine in us rather requires a Check than a Spur, in or∣der to prevent its coming too violently into the Bladder, which would create an uneasy Sensation; and that for this reason Na∣ture has made the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> of <HI>unequal</HI> Dimensions in different parts of them, and has remarkably <HI>contracted</HI> their Orifices at their opening into the Bladder, that they might be so many Im∣pediments to any sudden Influx. But besides this Consideration, it is still more probable that they want this Power, because these Tubes, contrary to all other Parts that have muscular Fibres, when once they are forcibly distended, never resume their former Dimensions, as is observ'd in hard Drinkers, and in Nephritick Cases<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ruysch. Thesaur. N<SUP>o</SUP> 8. p. 13.</NOTE>, which they would do if they enjoy'd a peristaltick Mo∣tion. But to proceed,</P>
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
<P>THE Urine is receiv'd from the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> by the <HI>Bladder,</HI> and is prevented from regurgitating into them by the Contrac∣tion of their Orifices, and the Obliquity of their Insertion. Here it remains, till by its Quantity and Acrimony it distends and stimulates its inmost Coat, which causes the muscular Coat to contract its Fibres, and act strongly upon it; the two <HI>Corpora Carnosa</HI> of <HI>Morgagni</HI> shortening their Fibres at the same time, and so straitening the Orifices of the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> that none should escape that way. By this Pressure, and that of the <HI>Abdominal Muscles,</HI> the Urine is protruded downwards with a Force suffi∣cient to overcome the <HI>Sphincter</HI> of the Bladder, and to carry it through the <HI>Ʋrethra</HI> some distance from the Body. But lest any part of it should stay in this <HI>Tube,</HI> when the Pressure ceases and the <HI>Sphincter</HI> is clos'd, the <HI>Accelerator Muscle</HI> begins to act, which expels any Remains that lodge therein.</P>
<P>THE Force with which the Bladder acts in projecting the Urine has been attempted to be fix'd by two speculative Mathema∣ticians: but their Calculations are widely different; the <HI>one</HI> making it amount to an <HI>uncommon Weight,</HI> whilst the <HI>other</HI> re∣duces it to a <HI>Trifle.</HI></P>
<P>THE late ingenious Dr. <HI>Keil</HI> has computed it, exclusive of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keil's Essays, pag. 91.</NOTE><HI>Abdominal Muscles,</HI> to be equal to no more than <HI>three Ounces;</HI> which seems too inconsiderable to overcome the Con∣tranitency of the <HI>Sphincter,</HI> and at the same time project the Urine six Foot from the Body in a Horizontal Direction; for the <HI>Abdominal Muscles</HI> contribute very little, except when we hold our Breath and strain, and then indeed they force strongly downwards and press upon the Bladder. But this Calculation is very defective: for not to mention what <HI>Michelotti</HI> has observ'd, that Dr. <HI>Keil</HI> has not at all taken notice of the <HI>Vis Compressionis</HI> in∣nate to all Parts of the Bladder's <HI>internal Superficies,</HI> but only to that part of it which answers to a <HI>transverse Section of the
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>Ʋrethra,</HI> it is farther deficient, in that he has omitted to con∣sider the <HI>Length</HI> of the <HI>Ʋrethra</HI> from the Orifice of the Blad∣der, and the <HI>Friction</HI> arising therefrom, which he ought to have done to make it more perfect; for though the Force that causes a Fluid to run out at an <HI>Orifice</HI> with a certain Velocity, is as he has laid down; yet if there is a <HI>Tube</HI> expended <HI>any distance from it,</HI> through which the Fluid must pass afterwards, the Velocity of it at its coming out at the <HI>end</HI> of this <HI>Tube</HI> will be, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> as its <HI>Length;</HI> and a greater Force will be re∣quir'd, for example, to move a Fluid with a given Velocity through a <HI>Tube</HI> of <HI>twelve</HI> Inches long, than through one of <HI>four</HI> and of the same Diameter. This will raise the <HI>Power</HI> of the Bladder somewhat higher; but will scarcely yet be sufficient to throw the Urine so far from the Body.</P>
<P><HI>MICHELOTTI</HI> on the other hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Separatione Fluidorum, pag. 117. &amp; seq.</NOTE>, from <HI>mechanical</HI> Deductions raises the Power of the Bladder to 504 lb. Weight, but then the <HI>Principle</HI> he sets out upon is <HI>false;</HI> for he lays down, that the <HI>Force</HI> by which a Fluid running out at the Ori∣fice of any Canal acquires a certain Velocity, is equal to the Weight of a Cylinder of the same Fluid, whose Basis corres∣ponds to the Orifice it flows through, and whose Altitude is equal to the <HI>simple</HI> Altitude of the extreme Superficies of the Fluid above it; whereas it has been <HI>demonstrated</HI> by Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Philosophiae Principia, Lib. 2. Prop. 36. Corollar. 2.</NOTE>, that <HI>this Force</HI> must amount to that of a Cylinder of the same Basis, but of <HI>double</HI> the Height, from whence any heavy Body must fall to gain such a Velocity. However, what deduces from the <HI>Principle</HI> he lays down is just; and if he had proceeded in the same manner upon Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s, as he has upon <HI>his own,</HI> he would have come as near as possible to the entire Force of this Organ. The <HI>whole Proposition,</HI> with what he draws from it, is much too long to be transcrib'd into a Discourse of this kind: I shall therefore refer you to the <HI>Work</HI> it self; and only observe, that from hence may be seen
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>the Uncertainty even of <HI>mechanical Reasoning,</HI> when apply'd to explain <HI>some Powers</HI> in the Animal OEconomy; though it is the <HI>best</HI> we can make use of in this part of Learning.</P>
<P>FROM this cursory View of the Actions of the respective Parts, and of the Nature of the Urinous Secretion, may be drawn some <HI>Conclusions,</HI> which will serve as so many Answers to several Queries that commonly occur among the Writers of <HI>Institutions:</HI> For from hence we learn, that the Urine is not an Excrement of any <HI>particular</HI> Concoction, as the Antients term it, but that all the Digestions supply Matter for it; because whatever is brought to the Kidneys has undergone the Action of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> has been broken and divided in its Passage through the <HI>Lungs</HI> by the Force of Respiration, and from thence flows blended with the <HI>nutritious</HI> part of the Blood, till it is se∣parated from it by the Orifices of the Urinary Tubes; and con∣sequently is an Excrement of <HI>all</HI> the Concoctions.</P>
<P>HENCE likewise we can account why we urine so <HI>frequent∣ly</HI> when we drink plentifully; and particularly why this Excre∣ment is secern'd in so <HI>short</HI> a time, and in such <HI>large</HI> Quantities, after taking Diuretick Liquors upon an empty Stomach, without having recourse to any <HI>occult</HI> Passages from this Organ to the Bladder, which Anatomy has never shewn, and which repeated Observations have prov'd to have no Existence. For notwith∣standing an Experiment printed in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI> somewhat favours this Notion, a pretty Quantity of Urine be∣ing found in a Dog's Bladder, though the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> were ty'd, and were also a little swell'd above the <HI>Ligature,</HI> yet on the other hand, upon opening the Bladders of Persons dead of a Sup∣pression of Urine from an Obstruction of the common Passages of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> and <HI>Ʋreters,</HI> there never was found a Drop of Urine in them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 65, 67.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEITHER indeed is there any occasion for a shorter Convey∣ance than what Nature has made <HI>apparent;</HI> for as to the frequent
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>Emissions during the time of Drinking, it is to be observ'd, that before this happens, the <HI>Stomach,</HI> the <HI>smaller Intestines,</HI> and the <HI>Lacteal Veins</HI> are replete with the Potables, so that the Blood receives a fresh supply of a Fluid from the next Draught that is taken down, which, if I may so call it, protrudes what is al∣ready contain'd in the Vessels above-mention'd into the <HI>Subcla∣vian Vein:</HI> The Consequence of which will be, that a greater Quantity of Blood will be brought to the Kidneys than usual, and therefore more Urine separated; and so much the more, the more frequent the Draughts are repeated. And this is the reason why the first Urine that is voided is of a higher Colour, and bears the Tokens of Concoction; whereas the subsequent Emis∣sions lose these Signs, and the Urine at length flows perfectly limpid and crude, which it will continue to do till this extraor∣dinary Supply has quite pass'd off, and then it will reassume its former Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the other Case, where the Stomach is empty, and the Blood is suppos'd to be diverted of the Urinous Matter in great measure, if we attend to the time which Fluids take up in passing from the Stomach into the Blood, and how soon afterwards they are carry'd to the Kidneys by the Rapidity of its Cir∣culation, we shall find the common Passages altogether suf∣ficient.</P>
<P>IT must be consider'd then, that though <HI>solid</HI> Substances re∣quire a good deal of time to be comminuted by the Stomach, in order to have their Parts render'd small enough to enter the Lac∣teals, yet <HI>Fluids</HI> when taken alone, from the minuteness of their Particles are naturally fit to pass through them, and from their Aptitude to Motion will yield to the first Impression; for which reason they will make no stay there, but very soon be protruded by the Action of the Stomach and Guts into <HI>these Vessels:</HI> and that the Progress of Fluids through <HI>them</HI> takes up but a very short time, is demonstrated from the almost instanta∣neous Depletion of the <HI>Lacteals</HI> in living Animals, that have
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>been open'd for this purpose some time after a full Meal, when the <HI>Chyle</HI> has been flowing through them; so that if that part of the Liquids which comes away by Urine is not longer in flowing through the <HI>Heart</HI> to the <HI>Orifices</HI> of the Urinary Ducts of the Kidneys, than the same is in passing from the <HI>Stomach</HI> to the <HI>Heart,</HI> the <HI>common</HI> Channels will be found every way to answer these Emergencies.</P>
<P>NOW, as the <HI>Heart</HI> throws out every <HI>Systole</HI> one <HI>Ounce</HI> of Blood, and beats <HI>sixty Systoles</HI> in a Minute, there will pass into the <HI>Aorta</HI> 900 Ounces in a Quarter of an Hour: taking therefore the Dimensions of the <HI>emulgent Arteries,</HI> which spring immediately from its Trunk, to be <HI>one Tenth</HI> of that of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> (which is very near the matter,) the Quantity of <HI>Blood</HI> passing through <HI>them</HI> in that time will be <HI>ninety Ounces,</HI> or <HI>seven Pounds six Ounces Troy.</HI> Add to this, that the <HI>Serum</HI> makes up the greater part of the Blood, and at this time is in a much larger Proportion, from the Addition of the ingested Li∣quor, and we may conclude reasonably, that two or three <HI>Pints</HI> of Urine may be secreted from such a Quantity of Blood in that time, and great part of it much sooner: which will answer every thing that has been observ'd, as to the quick Passage of <HI>Diu∣reticks;</HI> the Effects of which upon this Secretion, either as to its Quantity or Quality, being at the soonest more than half this time.</P>
<P>THIS Notion of an immediate Passage from the Stomach to the Bladder, so contrary to Anatomy and the Nature of the Animal OEconomy, one would imagine should have been explo∣ded at the first Dissection of an Human Body; much more now, when these Parts are so accurately known: but it seems it is a∣gain reviv'd and strenuously argu'd for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morgan's Principles of Physick, Lond. 1725.</NOTE>, which is the reason for inserting the foregoing Paragraphs. But to proceed,</P>
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
<P>AS a <HI>Corollary</HI> to the foregoing it may be laid down, that the Quantity of Urine ought to be proportionate to the Quan∣tity we drink. For <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> the Quantity of the se∣cern'd Fluid is in proportion to the Quantity of Blood brought to the Orifice of the separating Canal; but the Quantity of the <HI>aqueous</HI> part of the Blood, of which the Urine chiefly con∣sists, is in proportion to the ingested Liquors; therefore the Quantity of Urine will be in proportion to them likewise. But here some Allowance must be made for what passes off by <HI>Per∣spiration</HI> and <HI>Sweat,</HI> in <HI>Exspiration,</HI> and with the <HI>Saliva;</HI> as like∣wise for different Circumstances. For Example, from Heat or Exercise, the <HI>aqueous</HI> Parts of the Blood passing through the Pores of the Skin in Sweat, the Quantity of Urine will be less; as on the contrary, the Pores of the Skin being stop'd by Cold, a larger Portion than usual will be voided.</P>
<P>AS the last Inference from the foregoing Theory, it appears, that <HI>other Particles</HI> besides what naturally compose the Urine, though of <HI>unequal</HI> Surfaces, one of which too may be longer than the Diameter of the Secretory Canal, may nevertheless be separated together with it, provided the Surface that presents it self to the Orifice does not exceed its Diameter. And that <HI>Blood</HI> it self may pass through, if it is imping'd with a Force sufficient to distend and enlarge the Secretory Ducts; analogous to what happens to some other Vessels that are naturally smaller, but ampliated for a time, as in critical and symptomatical <HI>Hae∣morrhages,</HI> and in the <HI>Menstrua.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctrine laid down is so well establish'd upon the <HI>mechanical</HI> Properties of the Parts concern'd, that it is scarce liable to any Objection. The main one which seems to affect it is this: That seeing all the Parts that constitute the Urine are in the Blood when it is brought to the Orifices of the Urinary Ducts, if the Percolation of these from the rest only depended on <HI>their Diameters,</HI> they would all be secern'd at the same time, being of the same Nature and adapted to them, which is con∣trary to <HI>Fact;</HI> the refluent Blood found in the Emulgent Veins
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>being still possess'd of some of the Principles of the Urine. But if we consider that part of the Blood is spent upon the <HI>Nourish∣ment</HI> of the Kidneys, and does not come to these Orifices, but is immediately receiv'd by the Venal Branches that correspond to them, we shall find the reason why it still retains these Prin∣ciples in some degree, (which by the way may be separated from it in some subsequent Circulation through these Organs) and at the same time see this Objection obviated.</P>
<P>WE come now to consider the Nature and Properties of the Urine <HI>it self;</HI> this consists of a <HI>fluid</HI> Substance, in which are sustain'd several dense and <HI>solid</HI> Particles. The elementary or more simple Parts of it are <HI>Water, Salt,</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> which are manifested to the Senses in the Experiments of <HI>Bellini</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bellini de Urinis, <HI>pag.</HI> 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT simple Water is the <HI>fluid</HI> Part of the Urine, almost wholly, is known from a gentle Evaporation of it; by which means what is exhal'd is found to be limpid and insipid as the purest Water, and the inspissated <HI>Residuum</HI> after the Evaporation is over, is in all respects restor'd to the state of true Urine again; that is, in Colour, Taste, Smell and Consistence, by pouring the same Quantity of common Water upon it, instead of the Fluid that was evaporated.</P>
<P>THE Existence of a Salt is prov'd by the Taste, which becomes more pungent, the more the <HI>aqueous Menstruum</HI> is ex∣hal'd, till at length there is left a black viscid Substance that liquifies in the Air like common Salt, and is so poignant as scarce to be borne by the Tongue. The Nature of this essential Salt has not been consider'd by this Author; but by Experi∣ments we find, that it is not a pure <HI>Alkali</HI> as some Chymists have imagin'd, neither is it an Acid, but is <HI>sui generis,</HI> and partakes of both Qualities. For if you pour Spirit of <HI>Nitre, Aquafor∣tis,</HI> or the like <HI>Acid</HI> upon the Urine, they will only produce a somewhat <HI>higher</HI> Colour in it; which <HI>acid</HI> Spirits, when mix'd
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>with either a fix'd or volatile <HI>Alkali,</HI> always occasion a <HI>consi∣derable Ebullition.</HI> So if you put a <HI>nitrous</HI> Salt into the Spi∣rit of Urine, it will turn it <HI>milky;</HI> and the like will happen if you do the same <HI>Salt of Tartar;</HI> which Experiments plainly prove this Salt to have both <HI>Acid</HI> and <HI>Alkali</HI> in its Composition. But to proceed,</P>
<P>THE Particles of <HI>Earth</HI> in the Urine are perceiv'd by the following one: If you evaporate the Urine till it comes to the Consistence of Honey, and pour upon it the same Quantity of common Water, the Artificial Urine will have this in common with the Natural; that it will grow turbid and putrify, and be∣fore its Putrifaction, will let fall a perfectly insipid, subpallid and impalpable Powder every way agreeing with Elementary Earth.</P>
<P>THAT there is a <HI>Sulphur</HI> also in the Urine, though over∣look'd by <HI>Bellini,</HI> is evident from the strong Smell it has when only voided; but chiefly from that Foetidness arising from it, when it is in a State of Putrifaction, or during Evaporation; though there is indeed but a small Quantity of this Principle, because there is scarce any of it comes off in Distillation.</P>
<P>UPON these three Principles of Water, Salt, and Earth, and the different Proportions they bear to each other, depend in great measure the <HI>Colour, Saltness,</HI> and <HI>Cousistence</HI> of the Urine, with all the Varieties observable in each. If the aqueous Parts more than ordinary exceed the other, the Urine will be limpid or pale: If the Salts abound too plentifully, it will be of a shining flammeous Colour, but still clear; the Salts being pellu∣cid Bodies. If the Earth prevails, being an Opake Body, it will obstruct the Passage of the Rays of Light, and produce a more intense Colour, taking off from the Clearness and Pellucidness of the Urine, and the more so as its Quantity encreases in an Over-proportion, till at length the Urine will be turbid and thick.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
<P>BUT besides these three, it is reasonable to think, that the natural Colour of the Urine is owing in great measure to the <HI>Sulphur</HI> contain'd in it. For though its Quantity is but small, yet it still retains its Colour after it is separated from the other Principles, and will give a considerable Tincture to Water, when mix'd with it, which the other Principles of Salt and Earth will not do after their Separation, and yet <HI>they</HI> are allow'd on all hands to contribute chiefly to its Colour.</P>
<P>THE different Degrees of <HI>Saltness</HI> in the Urine arise from the different Quantities of Salt floating in the aqueous <HI>Men∣struum;</HI> whose Pungency upon the Tongue will be greater, the less Fluid there is to dissolve them and obtund their <HI>Spiculae,</HI> and so <HI>vice versâ.</HI> And that the Urine will be of a <HI>grosser</HI> or <HI>thinner</HI> Consistence, as the solid Particles are in a greater or lesser Degree, is so evident, that it wants no Explanation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Contents</HI> observable in the Urine, which bear the Names of <HI>Nubeculae, Suspensiones</HI> and <HI>Sedimenta,</HI> are nothing else but these solid Particles; which when this compound Fluid is out of the Body and at <HI>rest,</HI> separate from the aqueous Part, and take place according to their specifick Gravities; ha∣ving these Appellations given them as they are found in the upper, middle, or lowest part of the Urine: but so neverthe∣less, that the different Density of these <HI>Contents</HI> at one time more than another, and the different Resistance of the Medium in which they are suspended, may afterwards alter their Situa∣tion; insomuch that what was at first a <HI>Suspension,</HI> may at length subside and become a <HI>Sediment.</HI></P>
<P>THE Nature of the Urine being thus known, we may draw several Inferences from it that will explain some Affections com∣mon to the Animal OEconomy. Hence first the Reason ap∣pears, why upon using Exercise, and in hot Weather, the Urine is of a higher Colour, and more salt and stimulating than at other times: and why the like Urine is made, after having ab∣stain'd
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>some time from taking any Liquid. For in both cases the solid Contents will be in a greater proportion than the aque∣ous <HI>Menstruum;</HI> this last being carry'd off through the Pores of the Skin in the first Instance, as in the second a fresh Supply of it being for some time taken off from the Blood, what is secreted by the Kidneys in such Circumstances will be more than ordinarily saturated with these solid Principles.</P>
<P>THE foregoing Observation shews the Cause, which makes the Urine of healthy People and of a strong Habit of Body, to have seldom the <HI>Nubeculae</HI> and <HI>Suspensiones</HI> found in it, but the Sediment more frequently; because the two first consisting of the more fine and subtile Parts of the solid Contents, pass off toge∣ther with the aqueous by Sweat and Perspiration, which the more gross and heavy Particles that form the Sediment can't do, by reason of their Bulk and Figure, and therefore will be secreted by the Kidneys, and subside by their own Gravity. The same shews the near Relation between the <HI>Ʋrine</HI> and <HI>Sweat;</HI> and that the Increase of the last may supply the Defect of the Urinous Se∣cretion in some measure; which is the reason that Patients linger so long under a total Suppression of Urine from a Stoppage in the Kidneys, before this Ailment kills them; which some times in strong Bodies is <HI>eighteen</HI> or <HI>twenty days:</HI> and there are se∣veral Instances where the Urine has been totally suppress'd from the same Cause for <HI>fifteen</HI> and <HI>sixteen</HI> Days together, and yet the Patients <HI>recover'd</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stalpart. Observat. Centur. 1. Observat. 51</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO determine the exact <HI>Colour</HI> and <HI>Consistence</HI> the Urine ought to have in healthy Persons is almost impossible, by reason of the great Latitude that must be allow'd for the difference of <HI>Age, Constitution,</HI> and <HI>Diet</HI> of different Persons, and of these in the same at different times. But seeing the two Extremes of a limpid Urine, and of a red and turbid one, are produc'd as either the watery <HI>Menstruum</HI> or the solid Contents abound beyond measure, we may venture to conclude thus far, that from a due portion and mixture of these in a state of perfect health,
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>there should arise a <HI>Medium</HI> between these Extremes, which is a light <HI>yellow,</HI> or <HI>Citrine</HI> Colour. As to its <HI>Consistence,</HI> re∣gard being had to the foregoing Circumstances, it should be pret∣ty near that of common Water, but somewhat more thick and heavy, by reason of the solid Principles contain'd in it.</P>
<P>WHY the natural <HI>Sediment</HI> should be white, light and equal, is more easily accounted for. For seeing the Fluids secreted from the Blood, will be as the state of the Blood at the time of their Secretion; and the Blood in a natural State is suppos'd always to be alike and equal to it self, whatsoever Parts of it are separated by the Kidneys in equal times, will also be alike and equal; and consequently when out of the Body and at rest, will mutually take place by one another, and render the <HI>Sediment</HI> equal. The <HI>Whiteness</HI> of it is owing to the large Quantity of <HI>Salts</HI> contain'd in it (as is manifest from the <HI>Bellinian</HI> Experi∣ment)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Urinis, <HI>pag.</HI> 13.</NOTE> which being united with the thick viscid Parts of the Urine, will subside along with them, and by the <HI>Rules of Op∣ticks</HI> produce such a Colour.</P>
<P>Hence in the last place we may know, how far the Inspection of the Urine is <HI>useful</HI> in the practice of Physick: for by com∣paring the several Appearances in the Urine of <HI>diseased</HI> Persons, with those that <HI>naturally</HI> arise in it, and observing in what re∣spects they differ from each other, we shall be inform'd in great measure of the present state of the Blood, as to the mixture of its Parts, and the Proportion between them. And if we take notice at the same time of all the Symptoms that <HI>accompany</HI> such Appearances, and <HI>follow</HI> upon them, we shall discover what the Distemper is that proceeds from such a <HI>Crasis</HI> of Blood, and also prognosticate the Event of it.</P>
<P>IT were easy to shew from Authors and private Observation what State of Blood each Alteration of the Urine discovers: but being confin'd to treat only of the Distempers belonging to some particular Organs, it will be impertinent to take notice of
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>any other, than what will lead us to the Knowledge of these; which will be seen in the remaining part of this Lecture.</P>
<P>WE have now gone through the <HI>Ʋses</HI> of the <HI>Parts,</HI> and enquir'd into the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Ʋrine;</HI> in which last I have for the most part follow'd <HI>Bellini</HI> in the most concise manner possible, as his Account of it is the best, both by his <HI>Experi∣ments,</HI> and the <HI>Conclusions</HI> he draws from them. And as the <HI>latter</HI> are here prov'd by different Mediums from what he him∣self made use of, they so far make them bid fairer for Truth.</P>

<HEAD> PART I. Of a <HI>STONE</HI> in the <HI>KIDNEYS.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Organs of Ʋrine</HI> are incident to several Indis∣positions, in common with other Parts of the like Structure and Composition, and which spring also from the same general Causes; As <HI>Inflammations, Tumours, Abscesses, Ʋlcers, Schirri, &amp;c.</HI> but the most frequent, and indeed chief Distempers that afflict them proceed from the Urine separated by them, or passing through them. These are attend∣ed with very untoward Symptoms, and if of long Continuance, very fatal Consequences: none of which are more common than those arising from a <HI>Stone</HI> in the <HI>Kidneys</HI> or <HI>Bladder;</HI> which shall therefore be the Subject of the remaining part of this <HI>Lecture.</HI></P>
<P>IF we compare what has been said in the foregoing part of it, concerning the Elementary Principles of the Urine, with several Experiments made upon these concreted Substances, it will appear, that the material Cause of a <HI>Stone</HI> in the <HI>Kidney</HI> is originally in the natural Composition of this Fluid: For we find from Chymistry and microscopical Observations, that what we call a <HI>Stone</HI> almost entirely consists of a volatile and fix'd <HI>Salt,</HI> such as the Urine plentifully abounds with. In order therefore to form a calculous Concretion, there is no <HI>Petrefac∣tion</HI> requir'd, as the Naturalists term it, nor any change of Sub∣stance in the constituent Parts of the Urine, but only a Separa∣tion of the saline and some earthy Particles of it from the Fluid, and such an intimate Cohesion of these solid Corpuscles there∣upon, as not to be disunited or dissolv'd again by any subsequent Afflux of Urine upon them.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
<P>BOTH these Accidents will happen, if either the <HI>Salts</HI> are in such <HI>great abundance</HI> in the Urine, that they cannot pass through the <HI>exceeding small Ducts</HI> that form the <HI>Papillae;</HI> or if they are hinder'd from moving through them by any <HI>viscid Matter</HI> that is separated along with them, and so unites them to∣gether; or if these <HI>Ducts</HI> themselves are so much <HI>compress'd</HI> or <HI>contracted,</HI> as not to admit the Salts through their Cavities. For in all these Circumstances the saline <HI>Lympha</HI> will stagnate at the <HI>Papillae,</HI> whereby the Salts will be brought too near one another; which being Corpuscles of very great attractive Powers, they will be more strongly attracted by each other than by the Fluid in which they are suspended, and consequently will sepa∣rate from it, and unite in one solid Substance.</P>
<P>THAT any of these three Causes may singly produce such a Concrete, if they exist in the Degree laid down, is prov'd from the Nature of <HI>Salts in general,</HI> when in <HI>Fluore,</HI> and the Con∣sequences that must follow from their being brought too much within the Sphere of each others Activity; more particularly from the Nature of <HI>those,</HI> of which the <HI>Stone</HI> consists; which are so very attractive, that even when a <HI>Calculus</HI> is reduc'd to a <HI>Caput Mortuum,</HI> and beat into an impalpable Powder, so that it will dissolve in Water, yet in a short time the Salts will se∣parate from it, and coagulate so strongly, that though the Wa∣ter is heated never so intensely, they will not dissolve in it again.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it is reasonable to think, that a <HI>Nucleus</HI> of a firm Consistence is seldom form'd by the first or second Cause, without the Concurrence of the last; as on the other hand, that the last alone will produce one. For though there should be an over large Quantity of Salts in the Urine, or if an usual Quantity should be envellop'd in a viscid Matter, yet if the <HI>urinary Ducts</HI> are of a natural Dimension, they would not stagnate at the <HI>Papillae,</HI> unless these Qualities were in a very great degree; but would be protruded through their Orifices by the force and weight of the next Urine flowing upon them:
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>whereas if these Ducts should be much contracted, even a natu∣ral proportion of Salts would stagnate there. And I think it is plainly prov'd, that a <HI>Nucleus</HI> is form'd more from the Fault of the <HI>Kidney</HI> it self, than from the Qualities of the Urine; in that <HI>one</HI> Kidney only is generally affected, whilst the other remains free. For if the Fault lay as much in the Urine, they would <HI>both</HI> be affected alike, the U∣rine separated by <HI>both Kidneys</HI> necessarily partaking of the same Qualities. However, that the two first are concomitant Causes, and very much contribute towards the Generation of a <HI>Stone</HI> is highly probable; and it is almost certain, that a sa∣bulous Sediment, or what is call'd the <HI>Gravel,</HI> may owe its Origin to either of these Causes singly.</P>
<P>AS a farther Confirmation of the Truth of what has been laid down, it were easy to shew, that the antecedent Causes of a Nephritick Fit introduce one or both of these Qualities in the Urine, or affect the Passages of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> in the manner just mention'd: but as it will be troubling you with frequent Repe∣titions of the same way of Reasoning, to explain how each in particular operates towards producing one or more of these Effects, I shall mention the chief and most common procatartick Causes, which are comprehended in the following Observation, <HI>viz.</HI> that those Persons who make <HI>spirituous Liquors</HI> their constant Drink, and use them too plentifully; or those who have <HI>weak Stomachs,</HI> or live upon Food that abounds with <HI>viscid Juices;</HI> or those who altogether lead an <HI>unactive</HI> and <HI>sedentary Life,</HI> are, above all others, most afflicted with this Distemper. And that the Urine of such Persons must necessa∣rily be over-stock'd with Salts, or with a tenacious viscid Mat∣ter, or that the Channels of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> will be too much straitned or compress'd according as either of these Causes prevail, will appear upon Examination.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1st.</HI> IN the first Part of this Observation it is to be taken notice of, that all <HI>spirituous Liquors</HI> abound plentifully with Salts; a Spirit being nothing else but a large Quantity of these Substances suspended in a little Water and Oil; whence from frequent drinking these Liquors the Blood will be over-stock'd
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>with this <HI>Principle.</HI> But besides this, from an habitual Use of them, in process of Time, the <HI>Serum</HI> which is the most aque∣ous part of the Blood, will contain a large Portion of a spiri∣tuous Fluid; and we know from Experiments, that a urinous Salt will not dissolve in such a <HI>Menstruum:</HI> upon which ac∣count the Quantity of Salts brought into the Blood with our Food will be daily encreas'd. Now the Urine being separated principally and immediately from the <HI>Serum,</HI> which is over salt upon a double account, must likewise from the Nature of its Secretion be over salt too.</P>
<P>HENCE we can account why the Fits of the <HI>Stone</HI> are not so severe in Women as in Men; they generally drinking less Wine, and feeding less upon such gross Meats as abound with Salts. And for the same reason we may conclude, that the Exemption those Persons enjoy from this Distemper, who only drink Malt Liquors, is owing a great deal to the lesser Quantity of Salts in these Potables, than in Wine.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> AS an over salt Urine is the Consequence of the fore∣going Cause, so from a <HI>bad Digestion</HI> and <HI>viscid Food</HI> the Urine will be slimy and roapy. For the Aliment being too viscid, or not sufficiently comminuted in the Stomach, the Chyle will be more than ordinary viscid, which being constantly sent into the Blood, will render that in some time of the same Nature. But over and above this, the Salts which are the most incor∣ruptible part of our Food, being not thoroughly broken through the weakness of the digestive Powers, will exist in larger Combi∣nations than usual; and at the same time be enclos'd in a gelati∣nous Chyle, which will hold them together; for which reason the Blood will not only be too viscid, but the Salts of it will not be sufficiently dissolv'd in its <HI>Serum;</HI> whence it follows from the same Reasoning as in the former, that the Urine must be likewise too viscid, and its Salts brought too near one another, which will occasion them to cohere. From hence it appears, that <HI>Galen</HI> did not altogether err, when he attributed the material Cause of a <HI>Stone</HI> to a thick, slimy, and tenacious Matter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Renum affect.</NOTE>, not∣withstanding
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>withstanding his Notion has been rejected by several modern Writers: since being thus explain'd as a concomitant Cause, it is agreeable both to Reason and Fact.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find, that Children are more tor∣mented with the <HI>Stone</HI> of the <HI>Bladder</HI> than Adults; and espe∣cially the poorer sort of them who are generally nourish'd with Food that affords slimy and tenacious Juices. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> a∣scribes one Principle of the <HI>Stone</HI> in Children to bad <HI>Milk;</HI> which he says, being earthy and phlegmatick, will induce a Len∣tor into the Stomach, and when mix'd with the Sediment of the Urine in the Bladder cohere and become solid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. de Morbis 4. Sect. 28.</NOTE>; much more then will the same Consequences follow from <HI>Cheese, Fish,</HI> and the other coarser Diet of the Poor; and there has been no bet∣ter Reason assign'd, why such young Subjects being once cut, seldom require the Operation a second time, than that as they grow up, their Diet is either alter'd, or the digestive Powers en∣crease, and the Solids become stronger, whereby the Aliment will be more intimately divided, and any viscous Matter or Com∣bination of Salts be broken by this means, and excluded the Ha∣bit by the force of Labour and Exercise. Agreeable to this is another Observation of <HI>Hippocrates</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Coacae Praenotiones N<SUP>o</SUP> 512.</NOTE> that a <HI>Stone</HI> is not form'd in the <HI>Bladder</HI> from the <HI>Fourteenth</HI> to the <HI>Sixty third</HI> Year of Age; in which time we all know the digestive Powers are most vigorous.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly,</HI> HOW an <HI>unactive sedentary</HI> Life, which is the last pro∣catartick Cause taken notice of, should bring on a straitness in the Urinary Passages of the Kidney, a competent Knowledge in Anatomy will inform us. This teaches us, that by a sedentary and bending Posture of the Body, not only all the <HI>Viscera</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> but the greater Blood-Vessels themselves will be com∣press'd; especially the <HI>Emulgents,</HI> and that part of the <HI>Aorta</HI> and <HI>Vena Cava</HI> whence they go off, as being plac'd where the Flexure is greatest. But this is not the only Consequence; for from such a Position the <HI>Viscera</HI> will also be forc'd backwards and downwards, and will consequently press externally upon
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>these Vessels, so that the weighty <HI>Viscus</HI> of the <HI>Liver</HI> on one side, and the <HI>Spleen</HI> on the other, will as it were squeeze the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> which are plac'd between them and the <HI>Musculi Lum∣bares:</HI> upon both which accounts, it is no wonder if the Uri∣nary Ducts that are continu'd from the Emulgent Arteries, and are by much the most yielding Substance and of the finest Con∣tecture, should suffer most, and be so straitned as to occasion the saline <HI>Lympha</HI> to stagnate in them.</P>
<P>TO this Cause it is owing, that those Tradesmen and Artifi∣cers, who sit much at their Work, are troubled with Pains in their Loins, as <HI>Rammazzini</HI> has observ'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De morbis Artificum, cap. 33.</NOTE>; and that Nephri∣tick Complaints are almost entail'd upon studious Men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. cap. 43.</NOTE>. And from the same Cause it comes to pass, that few People who are troubled with the <HI>Gout</HI> escape these Complaints at the last; for although as long as the <HI>Kidneys</HI> are able to do their Office, and transmit all the constituent Parts of the Urine through them, these Nephritick Symptoms will not arise (though they proceed from one common Parent) yet when the Fits of the <HI>Gout</HI> be∣come frequent, and of such long continuance, as to confine the Patient very often, and for a great while together, the Conse∣quence will be such a Disposition of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> as is just de∣scrib'd, and the <HI>Stone</HI> will come in aid to his Destruction.</P>
<P>MANY other Errors in the Non-naturals which are reckon'd by our Writers among the procatartick Causes of this Disease, are included in the foregoing Observation, or may be accounted for the same way; excepting an <HI>hereditary Disposition,</HI> which cannot be rank'd amongst any of them, and requires a parti∣cular Explanation to its self; but this is needless formally to en∣ter upon, since it is as easy to conceive, that Parents may com∣municate a parricular Disposition of their Solids and Fluids to their Offspring, as that they can stamp upon them their Features, or tinge them with their Complexion.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
<P>TO proceed then, a <HI>Nucleus</HI> thus form'd in the Urinary <HI>Tubes</HI> of the <HI>Kidney,</HI> will at length by its own Weight and that of the Urine coming upon it, be forc'd through the <HI>Carunculae Papillares</HI> into the <HI>Pelvis:</HI> where if it makes no long stay, but is small enough to pass through the <HI>Ʋreter</HI> into the <HI>Bladder,</HI> it will not occasion a Nephritick Paroxism, but only some Pain from the roughness and hardness of its Substance pressing against and vellicating the extreme sensible Fibres of this Tube. But if from its pointed Surface it should chance to adhere to the <HI>Pel∣vis,</HI> or from any other Accident lodge in it so long, till by the addition of adventitious Concretions, it is render'd too big to pass through the Head of the <HI>Ʋreter</HI> without distending it, a true <HI>Nephritick Fit</HI> will be produc'd.</P>
<P>THIS is attended with the following <HI>Diagnosticks,</HI> viz. <HI>A</HI> fixed Pain <HI>in the Region of the Loins, which is propagated through the whole length of the</HI> Ureter, <HI>and accompany'd with a</HI> Nausea <HI>and</HI> Vomiting, <HI>a</HI> numbness <HI>in the Thigh and Leg of the side affected, and a</HI> Retraction <HI>of the Testicle of the same side. The</HI> Urine <HI>about the beginning is</HI> thin, aqueous, <HI>and</HI> pale, <HI>and voided in</HI> small <HI>Quantities; and if both Kidneys are affected, sometimes totally</HI> suppress'd; <HI>but in the</HI> Decline <HI>of a Fit, and after the</HI> Stone <HI>has pass'd into the</HI> Bladder, <HI>it becomes</HI> thick <HI>and</HI> turbid, <HI>and is discharg'd</HI> copiously. <HI>Very often</HI> Blood <HI>flows out together with the Ʋrine; which is many times in so large a Quantity, as easily to discover it self; at others in small a one, as only to tinge it of a Coffee Colour. But the most cer∣tain</HI> Diagnostick, <HI>and which is a</HI> Pathagnomick <HI>Sign is, if to any of the foregoing is added a frequent Excretion of</HI> sabulous <HI>Matter, or a small</HI> Stone.</P>
<P>BESIDES the Diagnosticks now cited, for the Knowledge of which the World stands indebted to Hippocrates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. de intern. affect. Sect. 15. Id. lib Epidemic. 6. Sect. 1.</NOTE>, there is another taken notice of by him, which although when alone does not particularly indicate a Stone in this Part, yet together
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>with some of the former, will assist us in making a right Judg∣ment of the Distemper. This is contain'd in one of his Apho∣risms, and is certainly above a <HI>Nurse's</HI> Observation (though we have been lately told the contrary) <HI>let her be never so old or experienc'd.</HI> He lays it down as a Maxim, that when <HI>Bubbles</HI> swim upon the Surface of the Urine, they indicate Nephritick Disorders, and a long Indisposition *.</P>
<P>THESE Diagnosticks may all appear at one time or other in the Course of one Paroxism; but generally the Symptoms are in a greater or lesser Degree, and sometimes one, sometimes another shows it self according to the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Stone,</HI> and the particular <HI>Place</HI> where it is lodg'd. If it as yet remains within the <HI>Body</HI> of the <HI>Kidney,</HI> and has not enter'd the Head of the <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> the Pain will be obtuse and easily born; the Sub∣stance of the <HI>Kidney</HI> being very sparingly furnish'd with Nerves. Nay it is certain that it may lie quiet a long time, without cre∣ating any remarkable Inconvenience, from several Examples in daily Practice, of such a Body's being found in this Part, which has fill'd the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> all its Branches, and even possess'd the greatest Part of the <HI>Kidney,</HI> and yet the Subjects, from whom it was taken, have labour'd under no very painful Symptoms, nor have had but very little Warning before some accidental Shock has unfortunately alter'd its Position, and so brought on a <HI>Paroxism</HI> that ended fatally. Agreeable to this, <HI>Heur∣nius</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aphorism. 34. Sect. 7. cap. 12.</NOTE>, upon opening a Patient, took out of one Kidney <HI>seventy</HI> small Stones, and from the other <HI>fourscore,</HI> and yet the Person had never before complain'd of any Nephritick Symptoms. And <HI>Bonetus</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Medicin. Septentrional. Lib. 3. de imo Ventre, Sect. 25. cap. 6.</NOTE> relates from <HI>Anton. de Pozzis,</HI> that he found in each <HI>Kidney</HI> a <HI>Stone</HI> weighing <HI>six Ounces,</HI> without any previous Symptoms either of Gravel or Numbness in the Loins, or a Di∣minution in the Quantity of Urine, it flowing more copiously, but limpid as Water, only attended with an insatiable Thirst.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fernelii Opera à Heurnio Edit. Part 2. Lib. 6.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
<P>BUT when the <HI>Stone</HI> moves into the <HI>head of the Ʋreter,</HI> and twitches and distracts its extreme sensible Membranes, the Pain will be <HI>acute, pungent</HI> and <HI>lancing,</HI> and all the other Symp∣toms vehemently exaggerated. The <HI>Vomiting</HI> will be frequent and violent; because the <HI>Stone</HI> irritating the Branches of the <HI>In∣tercostal Nerve,</HI> the <HI>Par Vagum</HI> will suffer by consent, being intimately interwoven with the former, and both together making <HI>one Plexus</HI> in this part of the Body. Hence the Animal Spirits will flow convulsively and in great plenty to the Stomach, which receives Nerves from the <HI>Par Vagum;</HI> by which means its Fibres will be brought into Spasmodick Contractions, which will forci∣bly throw out any Contents lodg'd therein.</P>
<P>THERE will be a <HI>Numbness</HI> felt in the <HI>Thigh</HI> and <HI>Leg</HI> of the side affected, both by reason that the <HI>Psoas Muscle,</HI> upon which the <HI>Kidney</HI> and <HI>Ʋreter</HI> lay, will be compress'd by this extraneous Body; and forasmuch as the <HI>Nerve</HI> that is sent off from the Spinal Marrow, and is distributed through the <HI>Crural</HI> Muscles will undergo the like Compression: whence the free Influx of the Animal Spirits into the Muscles being partly taken off, such a Sensation will naturally arise. And to the same Cause, together with the Nerves of these Parts, being convuls'd by the <HI>Stimulus</HI> of the <HI>Stone,</HI> is owing that difficulty of walking up∣right observable in the Fit.</P>
<P>THIS convulsive Contraction from the Violence of the Pain, will be propagated to all the Parts that lie contiguous, and have any near Relation to those immediately affected. For which rea∣son the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> in whose duplicative the <HI>Kidney</HI> is plac'd, and which gives an outward Coat to it, as also the <HI>Vasa Praepa∣rantia,</HI> which run between its <HI>Lamellae,</HI> and are furnish'd with Nerves from the same Pair that the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> are, will be consi∣derably contracted, and <HI>draw up the Testicle</HI> to which they are affix'd. But this Symptom proceeds likewise in great measure, if not principally, from the praeternatural shortness of the <HI>Ʋreter</HI> at this time; whereby the <HI>Vas Deferens,</HI> which passes over it
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>and between it and the <HI>Bladder,</HI> will be pull'd up by the <HI>Ʋre∣ter,</HI> and draw the <HI>Testicle</HI> after it.</P>
<P>AS all these Symptoms are aggravated whilst the <HI>Stone</HI> re∣mains in the <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> so they abate or altogether cease, as soon as it has pass'd into the <HI>Bladder.</HI> In like manner the other concomitant Signs vary according to the Nature of the <HI>Stone:</HI> If it is so large as to plug up the Orifices of the <HI>Ʋreter</HI> or <HI>Pa∣pillae,</HI> and both <HI>Kidneys</HI> affected, the Urine will be <HI>totally sup∣press'd;</HI> or if it is so big, or plac'd in such a manner, as not to give room for the solid Contents to pass through, the Urine will be <HI>thin, aqueous</HI> and <HI>limpid.</HI> If the <HI>Stone</HI> by its pointed Sur∣face should have lacerated the Blood-Vessels, or by its bigness very much distended the <HI>Ʋrinary Ducts,</HI> as it mov'd through them, in both Cases the Urine will be <HI>bloody.</HI> If its Cohesion is so lax, as easily to be broken, some of its Parts will be wash'd away gradually by the transfluent Urine; or if it occasions a <HI>Paroxism,</HI> before it is much indurated, a Portion of Sand ad∣hering to its Surface will be abraded by the same Transflux; in both which Cases there will be a <HI>frequent Secretion of sabulous Matter:</HI> and if it is of a firm Consistence, but small enough to move through the <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> though with the utmost difficulty, it will be voided <HI>entire.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there is another Reason, besides this now given, why the Urine at the beginning of a Fit should be pale, and made in small Quantities, but in its Decline become turbid and discharg'd copiously, which at the same time has no relation to the Nature of the <HI>Stone;</HI> and that is, because this praeternatural Substance irritating the <HI>Kidney,</HI> the <HI>Tubuli Ʋrinarii,</HI> which are the separa∣ting Canals, will be very much contracted, as lying so near the greatest Force of the <HI>Stimulus:</HI> by which means, there will not only be very little Ʋrine separated during such Circumstan∣ces, but likewise what is, will be thinner than usual, the more gross Parts of it not being small enough to pass through their Orifices in this contracted State; or if they do, will stagnate at the <HI>Papillae.</HI> And these Effects will be propagated in some de∣gree
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>also to the other <HI>Kidney,</HI> as it is furnish'd with Nerves from the same <HI>Plexus.</HI> But when the <HI>Stone</HI> has mov'd through the <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> or the <HI>Stimulus</HI> it occasions is cluded by proper Reme∣dies, these small <HI>Tubes</HI> will be relax'd, and recover their former Dimensions; whereby a larger Quantity of Urine will be sepa∣rated, and those solid Particles that stagnated in them wash'd a∣way, which mixing with the Urine will make it turbid.</P>
<P>IF we reflect on the Nature of these various Diagnosticks, we shall find, that though all of them taken together are Direc∣tion sufficient to pronounce the Complaint to be the <HI>Stone,</HI> yet when consider'd separately, many of them are <HI>equivocal,</HI> and may spring from other Causes: and it is commonly known, that the Symptoms of the <HI>Cholick</HI> bear so near a resemblance to many of these, that it is frequently difficult to distinguish between them. Indeed when any of the <HI>Pathognomonick</HI> Signs appear, as Sand or small Stones in the Urine, the Cause stands confess'd; or if the Urine is bloody, and a Numbness perceiv'd in the Thigh and Leg, we may know that it is not the <HI>Cholick:</HI> but when none of these shew themselves, the Cause is still latent, and must be discover'd by some distinguishing Characteristicks peculiar to it self. These were first mark'd out by <HI>Galen,</HI> from whom all succeeding Writers have borrow'd, or rather copy'd what they have wrote on this Subject: to whom therefore I refer the Inquisitive; and so much the rather, because it will thence appear, that <HI>some beneficial Knowledge</HI> may be got from <HI>Galen too, though one of the antient Writers of the Faculty</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galen de loc. affect. lib. 6. cap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Symptoms likewise that arise when the <HI>Kidneys</HI> are <HI>hysterically</HI> affected, mimick a Nephritick Fit, not only in the Nature and Situation of the Pain, and the exorbitant Vomiting which attends it, but also in the Propagation of it into the <HI>Ʋre∣ters, &amp;c.</HI> and are not easily distinguish'd, unless from the <HI>pre∣vious Disposition</HI> of the Patient to one Complaint more than the other, or from the discharge of a <HI>porraceous</HI> Matter by Vomit, or from the constant <HI>Limpidness</HI> of the Urine, which
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>in the Hysterick Affection continues hi the same Condition all the time it lasts, whereas in the other it grows higher colour'd and turbid. A <HI>Rheumatick</HI> Pain in the Loins produces the same Effects, but may be discern'd from the Difficulty the Patient finds in <HI>raising</HI> his Body from a bending Posture to an erect one, and the <HI>Sensation</HI> arising thereupon; which is as if he was cut through the middle. The last I shall mention is the <HI>Nephritis</HI> or <HI>genuine</HI> Inflammation of the <HI>Kidney,</HI> which resembles a Ne∣phritick <HI>Paroxism</HI> in most Points, but may be known from the <HI>acute Fever</HI> that constantly attends it, and from the <HI>revers'd Condition</HI> of the Urine; which in this Disease is red and flam∣meous at the beginning; but when the Inflammation is at the greatest height, it becomes aqueous and limpid, whereas in the Nephritick <HI>Paroxism</HI> it is just the contrary.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Prognostick</HI> during a <HI>Paroxism,</HI> is taken from the vehemence and duration of the Symptoms, and the different Ap∣pearances that arise in the Course of it; which any one may foresee the Consequence of, who is acquainted with the Reason of their appearing. As to the Disease in general, in <HI>old</HI> People who have been harass'd with <HI>many Shocks</HI> of it, and whose <HI>Ʋrine and Kidneys have been a long time faulty,</HI> it is <HI>incurable</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hippocrat. aph. 6. sect. 6.</NOTE>: Ac∣cording to which <HI>Aretaeus</HI> has observ'd, that it is more difficult to prevent the <HI>Kidneys</HI> and <HI>Bladder,</HI> that are obnoxious to a calculous Disposition, from generating these Substances, than it is to make a <HI>Prolifick Womb barren</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">De curatione Morbor. diuturn. lib. 2. cap. 3.</NOTE> When it proceeds like∣wise from an <HI>hereditary Disposition,</HI> or if at the same time there is an <HI>Ʋlcer</HI> in the <HI>Kidneys</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sennertus lib. 3. Part 7. Sect. 1. cap. 6.</NOTE>, the same Judgment is to be made: and indeed at best the general Prognostick is melancholy enough; the most that a Physician can do, being to relieve the Patient from a present Fit, and ward off another as long as he can.</P>
<P>THE Indications of Cure during a <HI>Paroxism</HI> are to force the <HI>Stone</HI> into the <HI>Bladder;</HI> to facilitate its Passage thither, by relaxing and enlarging the Dimensions of the <HI>Ʋreters,</HI> that they may yield and give way to its Motion; to guard them against
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>the hardness and asperity of its Substance, that it may not injure them in irs way; and lastly, to mitigate and take off the exorbi∣tant Symptoms.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1st.</HI> THE first is answer'd by a plentiful administration of <HI>Diuretick Medicines;</HI> especially such, as by their attenuating and detersive Qualities do thin viscid Humours, and scour the Vessels they pass through. But since in the present Case there is a great Stricture and Tension of the Parts from the Violence of the Pain, and as the <HI>stronger</HI> Diureticks act with a <HI>Stimulus,</HI> it is unsafe to use them; lest instead of forcing a Passage they should contract and straiten what was too strait before: The only Re∣medies of this Class then, that can safely be administred with a free Hand, are those, which at the same time they encrease the Quantity of the Urine, do by their <HI>balsamick</HI> Properties and <HI>Smoothness</HI> lubricate and relax the Urinary Passages: upon which account the <HI>Turpentines</HI> and <HI>Balsams</HI> are of singular Service in these Complaints; especially when blended with Me∣dicines appropriated to the next Intention.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> THIS indicates the Use of <HI>emollient, lenient</HI> and <HI>anodyne</HI> Remedies; of which sort are oily Compositions, and such Roots and Herbs as abound with smooth mucilaginous Juices; which, at the same time they relax the solid Fibres, do by their Smoothness and Viscosity blunt the Acrimony of the Humours, and defend the Passages from the roughness of the <HI>Stone. Emollient Clysters</HI> injected at proper Intervals very much contribute to these Ends; both as they empty the <HI>Colon</HI> of Wind and Excrement, which distending the Intestine, cause it to press against the <HI>Kidney</HI> and <HI>Ʋreter;</HI> and as by their kindly Warmth and softening Quality they relax its Fibres, and com∣municate the same Effects to the Parts contiguous. For the same Reason a <HI>Purge</HI> is necessary, when the smaller Intestines are loaded with a <HI>Saburra</HI> of crude Humours, which are out of the reach of a Clyster's Operation; which frequently happens in this Case. But what is of the most signal Benefit in this Inten∣tion is the use of warm <HI>lenient Baths,</HI> which introduce an uni∣versal Relaxation of the Passages. This is directed by <HI>Hippo∣crates</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. de intern. affect. Sect. 15.</NOTE>, who always directs judiciously: for Experience teaches,
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>that there is more Advantage found from a gentle Medicine ad∣ministred whilst sitting <HI>in Semicupio,</HI> than from all the <HI>Farrago</HI> of <HI>Lithontripticks,</HI> or the most pompous Means whatsoever. The present Age, so fruitful of Discoveries, has not yet found out a Specifick of this Virtue; much less might we expect it from the Antients. <HI>Galen</HI> therefore cannot be esteem'd the less for frankly declaring, that in his time no Remedy was discover'd which could break a <HI>Stone;</HI> but that the whole Cure depended on <HI>Surgery</HI> and <HI>Incision.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> AS to the Symptoms, the first to be attended to is the excessive Pain: and this is of such Consequence, that unless it is assuag'd, there is little to be expected from the most rational Process. For as long as this is exorbitant, the Contraction of the Vessels will continue, which will hinder the <HI>Stone's</HI> passing through them. This is alleviated in great measure by the Reme∣dies adapted to the foregoing Intention; but what is particular∣ly indicated here, is <HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> and a cautious Use of <HI>Opiates:</HI> the first as it empties the Blood-Vessels, and thereby takes off the Distention; the other as they quiet the Orgasm of the Spirits, and elude the Force of the <HI>Stimulus.</HI> It is therefore with good reason, that a shining Ornament of our Body lays down, <HI>that no one can more happily go about to assuage Nephritick Pains than by letting blood</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mead de imperio Sol. &amp; Lun. <HI>pag.</HI> 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Vomiting that accompanies a Fit ceases as soon as the <HI>Stone</HI> has pass'd into the <HI>Bladder:</HI> but as the Stomach is some∣times so affected as to throw up whatever is taken, we must en∣deavour to mitigate this Symptom by gentle <HI>Stomachicks</HI> blend∣ed with <HI>Opiates,</HI> which will take off the Irritation for a while, and give time to the proper Medicines to pass into the Blood.</P>
<P>IF these means prove unsuccessful, and we have reason to apprehend that the <HI>Stone</HI> is <HI>larger</HI> than ordinary, which is per∣ceiv'd from the <HI>fix'd heavy Pain,</HI> and the <HI>Absence of any Cal∣culous Excretions,</HI> rather than leave the Patient destitute of Help, we must have recourse to more forcible Methods; such
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>as <HI>Vomits,</HI> Purges of the <HI>stronger sort,</HI> and the more <HI>powerful</HI> Diureticks: which from the Shocks they give the Parts may possibly remove the <HI>Stone,</HI> and force it through the <HI>Ʋreter.</HI> But these are to be try'd only in very bad Cases, lest by shifting it from a larger Space into a smaller, they should fix it there irremoveably.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Nephrotomy,</HI> or the cutting into the <HI>Kidney</HI> in order to extract the <HI>Stone,</HI> it has been recommended by <HI>Rosettus;</HI> and the <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI> inform us, that it was per∣form'd once with success by <HI>Dominicus Marchetti,</HI> a Physician of <HI>Padua,</HI> upon a Countryman of our own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 223.</NOTE>. But if we at∣tend to the Parts to be cut through in this Operation, we shall find it only barely possible to succeed: which is not a sufficient inducement to a wary Practitioner, either for to advise it or un∣dertake it; it being much more eligible to alleviate the Symp∣toms and wait the Event, than to add to the Patient's Torment, and render his Death more certain.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Prophylactick</HI> Part in this Distemper, in order to keep off another Fit, or to lessen the frequency of its returning, is partly observ'd by religiously avoiding any of those Errors in the Non-naturals, that are reckon'd among the distant Causes of it. But besides this, we must endeavour to <HI>diminish</HI> the <HI>Salts</HI> intro∣duc'd into the Blood with our Food, by <HI>purging Medicines,</HI> and <HI>moderate Exercise</HI> repeated at proper Intervals.</P>
<P>WE must strive to prevent the Salts from running into <HI>Com∣binations,</HI> and to <HI>attenuate</HI> any viscid Matter that may unite them together by proper <HI>Diluters,</HI> which by their Aquosity will dis∣solve them; and by <HI>strengthening</HI> the <HI>Instruments of Digestion,</HI> which will occasion the Chyle to be sufficiently comminuted, and the Salts intimately divided. But we must chiefly aim at <HI>relaxing</HI> and <HI>widening</HI> the Capacities of the <HI>Ʋrinary Passages,</HI> that they may freely admit all the constituent Parts of the Urine through them, which is partly obtain'd from the Use of <HI>Balsa∣mick Emollient Diureticks,</HI> and from <HI>gentle Exercise;</HI> which
<PB N="48" REF="55"/><HI>last</HI> by promoting the Circulation drives the grosser Particles of the Fluids through the Capillary Vessels, whilst the <HI>first</HI> enlarges their Dimensions by their relaxing Properties.</P>
<P>AMONGST all the Variety of <HI>Purgers,</HI> none seem so well adapted to answer all these Ends, as some of the <HI>mercu∣rial</HI> Preparations; these not only evacuating the Salts, but ha∣ving also a peculiar Power of breaking and obtunding their <HI>Spi∣culae,</HI> of removing Obstructions and enlarging the Vessels.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Stomachicks</HI> that are of most Service, are such as by their gentle astringency brace the Fibres of the Stomach, and by their mild grateful Warmth attenuate any viscid Matter lodg'd therein. For as to the <HI>botter</HI> and <HI>stronger</HI> Bitters, they induce a universal Rigidity in the Fibres of the whole Body; and for that reason will do more harm than good. <HI>Galen</HI> thought in this way, when he laid down, that most Medicines proper for Calcu∣lous Patients are <HI>Bitters</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Composition. Medicament. secund. Loc. lib. 10.</NOTE>: But then he tempers them before with this Hint, that by no means it is proper to give such Persons very <HI>heating</HI> Remedies<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">De Sanitat. tuend. Lib. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Diureticks</HI> ought to be such only, as at the same time they force open any Obstruction form'd in the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> will likewise relax their Urinary Ducts: those of this Tribe being carefully to be avoided, that are prepar'd from <HI>stony</HI> or <HI>earthy</HI> Sub∣stances, which by attracting one another in the Capillary Tubes, instead of doing Service, may lay a Foundation for another Fit.</P>
<P>UPON all these accounts the <HI>Bath, Spaw,</HI> and other <HI>Cha∣lybeate Waters,</HI> are of the utmost Benefit in the Intervals be∣tween the Fits, as they <HI>dissolve</HI> the Salts, <HI>strengthen</HI> the Sto∣mach and Bowels, <HI>scour</HI> the Urinary Passages, and carry any <HI>Recrement</HI> out of the Body by <HI>Perspiration</HI> and <HI>Ʋrine.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. PART II. Of a STONE in the BLADDER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E come now to consider the Consequences that will follow, when a <HI>Stone</HI> has chang'd its Seat, and lodg'd some time in the <HI>Bladder.</HI> That a <HI>Nucleus</HI> genera∣ted in the <HI>Kidney,</HI> when once receiv'd into this <HI>Or∣gan,</HI> is the general Basis of those large Concretions found in it, is evident from inspecting these Bodies; in the Centre of which for the most part is found a solid Substance, of a different Co∣lour and Consistence from the rest of the stony Integuments, over which the adventitious Concretions are spread <HI>lamellatim,</HI> and enclose it as a Shell does the Kernel of a Nut. Not but that a <HI>Stone</HI> may be primarily generated here, without the <HI>Kidneys</HI> being first affected: which not only appears in Chil∣dren, who are frequently troubled with this Disease without the least previous Complaint of Nephritick Symptoms, but likewise from the reason of the thing: For if the solid Parts of the Urine should be deposited in the Bladder in such manner, as to be brought near to one another, and not be wash'd away by a fol∣lowing Afflux, they will unite by means of their attractive Powers. This will happen if the Urine is over <HI>viscid</HI> and too much loaded with <HI>saline</HI> and <HI>earthy</HI> Principles: for if it stays any considerable time before it is voided, these will subside to the Bottom by their own Gravity; where they will consequent∣ly be brought into a narrow Compass, and at the same time may adhere to it by the Tenacity of the Parts that envellope them. Accordingly constant Observation tallies with it; the Urine of Persons subject to these Complaints being generally <HI>thick</HI> and <HI>viscid,</HI> and dropping a <HI>whitish Sediment</HI> which sticks to the bot∣tom of the Vessel it is contain'd in. Thus then there may be a
<PB N="50" REF="57"/><HI>Stone</HI> form'd in the <HI>Bladder</HI> without a <HI>Nucleus</HI> previously gene∣rated in the <HI>Kidney:</HI> but this is not near so frequent; for the <HI>Bladder</HI> being a large Vessel, and so often distended with Urine, such a Deposition of the solid Contents will very rarely happen; but they will either flow out with the aqueous Vehicle, or else be wash'd away by the weight of the Urine that so often falls upon them: whereas a <HI>Nucleus</HI> already form'd being a solid concrete and <HI>ponderous,</HI> it may be so lodg'd, that the Urine may pass over it, or its Surface so pointed as to adhere too closely to be sepa∣rated: and accordingly we find, that <HI>Stones</HI> are form'd in, the <HI>Bladder,</HI> when any <HI>extraneous</HI> solid Bodies have accidentally got in there, which have been the Foundation of the subsequent Incrustations, of which there are many Instances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 168. 171. 266.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Basis of a <HI>Calculus</HI> being laid in this manner, it will necessarily encrease if it stays any considerable time there. For as it consists of a Substance, which in its Nature is very attractive, it will draw the solid Particles of the Urine to it, which are of the same Nature, and will therefore separate from the Fluid and adhere to its Surface: and this attractive Power will be greater as the Surface of this solid Body grows larger; so that a Basis once form'd, the <HI>Stone</HI> will become large in a shorter time than is commonly imagin'd: every new Incrustation not only adding to the Quantity of Matter, but encreasing the Surface in a very great Proportion. The Disposition of the several <HI>Lamellae</HI> that compose the <HI>Calculus,</HI> shews that it encreases in this way: for their running <HI>parallel</HI> to one another can be only owing to this force of <HI>Attraction;</HI> by which the solid Particles of the Urine, when brought to a certain Distance from the <HI>Concretion,</HI> are im∣pell'd towards it, and unite themselves to it on all sides, at equal Distances from its Centre, as near as the Figure of the Place in which it is lodg'd will allow of.</P>
<P>FROM hence it appears, that the <HI>Stones</HI> of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> and <HI>Bladder</HI> are of the <HI>same Nature,</HI> and form'd in the same man∣ner; which I believe will hold good likewise in all <HI>Stones</HI> of the Body, in whatsoever Part they are found, and howsoever they differ in Figure, Colour, or Weight: though the <HI>Effects</HI> produc'd
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>by them will vary, as they are lodg'd in <HI>one</HI> Part or <HI>another.</HI> When such a Substance is in the <HI>Bladder,</HI> it will produce the <HI>following.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AT first,</HI> little or no Disturbance will arise from it; because being small and light, the <HI>Mucus</HI> that lines the <HI>Bladder</HI> is suffici∣ent to guard it from the hardness and asperity of its Surface; on∣ly the Urine is now and then <HI>intercepted</HI> in its Voidance, when the <HI>Stone</HI> casually falls upon the Orifice of the <HI>Ʋrethra.</HI> But when it grows larger and more weighty it will abrade this Muco∣sity, and twitch and vellicate the nervous Coat; more especially when it moves from one place to another. Hence the Urine will become <HI>thick</HI> and <HI>slimy</HI> from the abraded <HI>Mucus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">n="*" Hippocratis Aphorism. 79. Sect. 4.</NOTE>, which Quali∣ties will encrease as the <HI>Stone</HI> grows larger, the Glands separating more <HI>Mucus</HI> as the <HI>Stimulus</HI> grows more forcible. This <HI>Stimu∣lus</HI> at the same time will extend farther, and create a <HI>Pain</HI> in the Neck of the <HI>Bladder,</HI> which will increase towards the end of <HI>Micturition,</HI> and be propagated towards the end of the <HI>Glans;</HI> the one because the <HI>Calculus</HI> falls to its more depending part, the <HI>Neck,</HI> the other because the nervous Coat of the <HI>Ʋrethra</HI> is no more than the Continuation of the same nervous Membrane: and it is no wonder, that when these Parts, which lie so near, endure a <HI>Pain,</HI> that the more <HI>distant</HI> of the procreative Organs should enjoy only a <HI>Pruritus.</HI> As the Bulk of the <HI>Stone</HI> increa∣ses, it will press more forcibly upon these Parts, from whence the Pain will become more <HI>intense,</HI> and a <HI>Weight</HI> perceiv'd in the Region of the <HI>Os Pubis</HI> and in <HI>Perinaeo:</HI> and the Irritation it produces will be extended farther to the <HI>Sphincter Ani</HI> and <HI>Intestinum Rectum,</HI> both these being contiguous to this Part, and receiving Branches from the <HI>same Nerve;</HI> so that a Desire of <HI>going to stool</HI> will come upon every Attempt to <HI>make water.</HI> This must be very <HI>frequent</HI> by reason of the continual <HI>Stimulus</HI> upon the <HI>Bladder,</HI> which will provoke it to discharge its Con∣tents; but at the same time it will be voided with the <HI>greatest difficulty,</HI> and <HI>guttatim,</HI> from the Stones lying upon the Ori∣fice of the <HI>Ʋrethra,</HI> and stopping it up: so that the Pa∣tient is obliged sometimes to lie in a <HI>supine Posture,</HI> in or∣der to remove it from thence before the Urine will pass off. Hence it is not at all surprising, that when this Body has accu∣mulated,
<PB N="52" REF="59" MS="y"/>it should occasion a <HI>difficulty</HI> of <HI>moving</HI> from place to place, since the Pressure of it upon the lower Parts is so great.</P>
<P>THESE are the natural Effects of a Lodgment of the <HI>Stone</HI> in the <HI>Bladder;</HI> but as it does not create all of them at the same time, but <HI>seriatim</HI> as it grows in magnitude, its <HI>Diagnosis</HI> is uncertain; so that we are oblig'd to have recourse to some <HI>Colla∣teral Tokens,</HI> the better to form a surer Judgment of the Case. Thus we must have an Eye to the previous Disposition of the Pa∣tient to <HI>Nephritick</HI> Symptoms, which will guide us a little; as also whether the Remedies proper for this Distemper have a <HI>lau∣dable</HI> Effect. But we principally depend upon the introduction of the <HI>Catheter</HI> into the <HI>Bladder,</HI> or the Finger in <HI>Anum,</HI> though I have known the former to fail; and a <HI>Schirrus</HI> has imitated the <HI>Stone</HI> so artfully in all Symptoms, as to disappoint the <HI>Litho∣tomist:</HI> agreeable to which is an Observation of <HI>Baglivi</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Praxis Medic. lib. 5. cap. 13. Sect. 8. lib. 2. cap. 4.</NOTE>. The <HI>Haemorhoides</HI> also mimick this Affection; but then the Pain they occasion is not so acute. But the most remarkable Case of this kind is from Dr. <HI>Bamber,</HI> wherein a great Quantity of <HI>tophace∣ous</HI> Substances, that seem'd to me so many Globules of hardned <HI>Excrement,</HI> were lodg'd in the beginning of the <HI>Colon</HI> where the <HI>Ileum</HI> is ingrafted, and created Symptoms which aped the <HI>Stone</HI> of the <HI>Bladder</HI> so nicely, that only Death and Dissection there∣upon detected the Fallacy. In this Case it was almost impossible but the most skilful Surgeon should be deceiv'd; for these concre∣ted Substances gave the same Resistance to the <HI>Catheter,</HI> and caus'd the same Sensation to the Hand that a <HI>Stone</HI> would, when in the Cavity of the <HI>Bladder.</HI> However it was very lucky for this Gentleman, considering the censorious Humour of the World, that the Patient died before he underwent the Operation. Sometimes the Surface of the <HI>Stone</HI> is so rough and pointed as to adhere to the inward Coat of the <HI>Bladder;</HI> but then there will be no <HI>Suppression of Ʋrine</HI> along with its other Diagnosticks, as <HI>Aretaeus</HI> has observ'd<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">De caus. &amp; sign. diuturnor. morb.</NOTE>: : from the Absence of which we may justly suspect an Adhesion, if the Patient labours under the other Symptoms. This is a desparate Case, for if you endeavour to
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>extract the <HI>Stone</HI> forcibly, you will lacerate the nervous Mem∣brane of the <HI>Bladder,</HI> upon which will ensue an Inflammation and Mortification of this Vessel, with all the direful Train of consequential Symptoms. But I cannot well conceive how the <HI>Stone</HI> can be enclos'd in a membranous <HI>Cystis;</HI> for if so, how can it increase, the <HI>Capsula</HI> keeping any adventitious Concre∣tions from its Surface? Possibly this may not happen before it is grown large, and has adher'd some time; and so by wounding and dividing the nervous Coat, (whilst the closeness of its Adhesion hinders it from reuniting) it may occasion this Membrane to shoot over it and form a Case for it.</P>
<P>Here I cannot help mentioning an extraordinary Case of the <HI>Stone,</HI> that fell under the Inspection of the famous Dr. <HI>Glisson,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Hugh Chamberlain, sen.</HI> The Daughter of Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton,</HI> who had been before troubled with Nephritick Symp∣toms, upon riding a Journey unfortunately alter'd the Posi∣tion of the <HI>Stone,</HI> and turn'd it <HI>transverse,</HI> which brought on a Suppression of Urine which kill'd her; for as one <HI>Kidney</HI> was choak'd up by a large <HI>Stone, that</HI> only officiated, in whose <HI>Ʋre∣ter</HI> the other <HI>Stone</HI> was lodg'd, which occasion'd her Death. Upon opening the Body by Mr. <HI>Holliard</HI> Surgeon, there was found <Q>"An Abscess in the left Kidney, with abundance of purulent Matter, and a brown <HI>hollow</HI> long <HI>Stone</HI> of near two Drams Weight in the bottom of the <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> at its Insertion into the <HI>Bladder.</HI> The right <HI>Kidney</HI> was likewise Ulcerous, contain∣ing a thicker <HI>Pus;</HI> and at the bottom of it, at the Ingress of the <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> a larger whitish <HI>Stone</HI> weighing three Drams, two Scruples and a half."</Q> This Case being very uncommon from the <HI>hollowness</HI> of the <HI>Stone</HI> through which the Urine pass'd, being the first Instance I have any where met with of such a one's being found in the <HI>Ʋreter,</HI> though they are sometimes, but rarely, in the <HI>Bladder,</HI> I have thought it worth inserting; more espe∣cially since it has not heretofore been made publick. The <HI>Stones,</HI> together with the Case, were left for some time in the Custody of Mr. <HI>Dobyns</HI> Surgeon, but are at present in the Hands of Dr. <HI>Middleton Massey;</HI> who, to give a clearer Idea of them, has made a very accurate <HI>Drawing,</HI> which is here annex'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tab.</HI> III. <HI>Fig.</HI> VI.</NOTE></P>

<P>CONSIDERING the <HI>nervous</HI> Contexture of this Organ, which renders it of a very acute Sense, and the important Office it bears in the Animal OEconomy, such a Praeternatural Substance must necessarily <HI>prognosticate</HI> very <HI>bad</HI> Events: and according∣ly, not only the Physicians of the present time, but Antiquity too have register'd a perfect Catalogue of Evils it induces.
