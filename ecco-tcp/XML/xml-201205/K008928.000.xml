<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE medicinal education of children, which is commonly managed with such negligence, is however, of very great importance, and the faults that may be committed in it are attended with the most dangerous consequences. Children like dough, are susceptible of all impressions, and an infant well formed at its birth, may become weak, and sickly, thro' the improper management of the nurse, to whose care it is committed: and on the con∣trary, the most tender and sickly infant may become strong and robust, by a care∣ful attention to the rules laid down in this Pamphlet. Several years practice in this par∣ticular branch of medicine, has enabled me to make these observations, so that I have asserted nothing but what is agreeable to reason, and confirmed to me by repeated experience: I have also, with great pains and attention, studied all the authors, who
<PB REF="3"/>have professedly written on this subject, and have collected together in this treatise, all the useful precepts, both with respect to the nursing, and the treatment of the dis∣eases of children, which are scattered in their different works; and have endeavour∣ed to expose those customs which are evi∣dently founded on absurd and dangerous prejudices. This small tract will, per∣haps, appear contemptible, to those who judge of the worth of books by their bulk; but I doubt not, experience will teach its value, to mothers and nurses, and that the perusal will not in the least injure, if it does not improve, the more learned and expe∣rienced.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Ligature of the Navel String, and the Evacuation of the first Excrements called the Meconium.</HEAD>
<P>THE tying of the navel-string is the first operation performed on the new born infant, it is done with common thread several times doubled, turned two or three times round the navel-string, and tied at the distance of about two or three inches
<PB N="2" REF="6" MS="y"/>from the navel, in order to prevent a fatal hemorrhage from this part; at the end which is left, there is applied a small compress of fine linnen, which is kept in its place by a slight bandage.</P>
<P>The skin of children, at their birth, is covered over with a whitish, viscid liquor, this is easily removed by washing the child with a little wine, mixed with warm water; this lotion is also a remedy for inflammations of the skin, which are common at this time, as it augments the motion of the humours, and dissipates the bad effects of the air. The same intention is answered by shaking, extending, and bending, the different mem∣bers of the infant, by slightly rubbing the belly, and by gently irritating the organs of sensation, by which means the obstructions formed in the vessels of the skin are removed, and the mucous juices that are found in all the joints, are attenuated.</P>
<P>The stomach and intestines of the infant are full of a viscid matter, which is called the meconium, the first intention is to cleanse the child of this, before food, in any quantity, is to be given: for nature, which is always the best director, does not provide any till some days after its birth are expired. Rest, which at this time is the chief nou∣rishment of the child, and the proper dis∣charge of this excrement, are the principal
<PB N="3" REF="7" MS="y"/>matters to be regarded for a few days. To promote this end, the general practice of nurses is to cram a dab of butter and sugar down the infant's throat, or some such un∣wholesome mess: it is the custom of some to give a little bit of fat roast pig, with an in∣tention to cure it of its mother's longings, so that from this preposterous management, the child runs the risk of being made sick from the very first hour. In the room of these absurd methods, to encourage the cleansing of the child, a tea spoonful of solutive syrup of roses, or syrup of violets, with an equal quantity of oil of sweet al∣monds, mixed together, may be now and then given: the pap should be made very thin, and given in small quantities, for if much be given before this excrement is evacuated, they will ferment together and occasion pain, and the tender body of the infant not being able to bear it, is flung into convulsions, and for want of attending suffi∣ciently to this circumstance, abundance of children have lost their lives.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Examination of the Bridle of the Tongue, and of the time when the Child ought to take the first Aliments.</HEAD>
<P>THE child makes known by the motion of its lips, when it wants some nourishment, it sucks its own glands, and draws spittle from them, which it either swallows or rejects, by putting it in foam out of its mouth; if any one presents a finger, it seizes it, rolls it in its mouth, and by these signs demands the nipple; but before it be given, it is not sufficient to teach it by little and little to seize it as it ought, we must also examine if the child is not hindered by some fault in the for∣mation of its tongue. The tongue is some∣times so closely tied to the lower part of the mouth, by the means of the bridle, that it is obliged to be cut; this is usually done by nurses and midwives with the nail, but as this method is frequently attended with bad consequences, I would recommend rather the cutting it with a sharp pair of scissars. But the bridle of the tongue very seldom requires this operation, for it ought never to be cut, except when it is extended almost
<PB N="5" REF="9" MS="y"/>to the very tip of the tongue, which is very uncommon.</P>
<P>As to the time when the child ought to take nourishment, it is very difficult to give certain and invariable rules on this subject: however, it is natural to believe that follow∣ing an exact method in relation to suckling of children, or giving them any other kind of nourishment, will not meet with unsur∣mountable obstacles, and it would be very useful if mothers would give themselves the trouble to put it in practice, and determine not to be discouraged at the beginning: those nurses, or mothers, cannot be sufficiently blamed who perpetually incite their children to swallow down milk, or any other kind of food, under pretence that they have warm stomachs, and an easy digestion; that they want them to grow and look fat, and that good milk can do them no hurt, without considering whether these excesses are fol∣lowed by vomiting, a looseness, the gripes or convulsions: the weaker and more delicate the stomach of the infant is, the greater precaution should be taken not to over∣load it, and it ought to be allowed the more time to digest the nourishment it contains. Those who would not have children voracious, subject, to a vomiting and looseness, to breakings out and ether disorders, ought, as much as possible, to pre∣scribe
<PB N="6" REF="10" MS="y"/>a fixed rule for the time when infants are to be fed, and for the quantity of ali∣ments necessary for them. Their digestion would be more perfect, and their health more solidly established, were parents con∣tented with giving them their nourishment, five or six times in the twenty four hours, a small quantity at each time, and always at the same hour, or as near as possible; this method should be observed about a twelve∣month, when, and not before, the child ought to be weaned, not all at once, but by degrees that it may neither feel, nor fret at, the want of the breast. Were this plan of nursing strictly followed, the children kept clean and sweet, tumbled and tost about a good deal, I am certain that in six or eight months time, most children would become health∣ful and strong, would readily find the use of their legs, and very soon shift for them∣selves.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="11" MS="y"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Dress most proper for new born Children, and some remarks on the errors, in the common method of nursing.</HEAD>
<P>THE ingenious Dr. Cadogan observes, that there needs no other proof of the impropriety of the present method of bring∣ing up children, as practised by nurses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than the frequent miscarriages attending it. Children in general are over cloathed and over fed: to these causes the doctor imputes almost all their diseases, the first great mistake is that they think a new born infant cannot be kept too warm; from this pre∣judice, they load and bind it with flannels, wrappers, stays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are all together almost equal to its own weight, by which means a healthy child is made so tender and chilly, that if by any accident a door or window be left open, the child often catches an irrecoverable cold, and what is still more absurd, at the end of the month, is sent into the country to be nursed, in a leaky house, that lets in wind and rain from every quarter. Can it be any wonder the child never thrives afterwards? But besides the mischief arising from the heat and weight of these swadling cloaths, they are too often put on so tight,
<PB N="8" REF="12" MS="y"/>and the child is so crampt by them, that its bowels have not room to act and exert them∣selves in the free easy manner they ought, this is a very hurtful circumstance, for limbs that are not used, will never be strong, and such tender bodies cannot bear much pressure, the circulation hindered by the compression of any one part, must produce unnatural swellings in some other, to which without doubt the many distortions and deformities we every where meet with are owing. A new born child cannot be well too cool and loose in its dress, it even wants less cloathing in proportion than a grown person, for children are capable of bearing great hardships before they are made sickly, by the mistaken management of their nurses, witness the many foundlings picked up daily in the streets of London, and the many instances, both antient and modern, of infants exposed, and deserted, which have nevertheless lived several days, tho' ex∣posed to the utmost severity of the winter season.</P>
<P>I would recommend the following dress. A flannel waistcoat without sleeves, made to fit the body, and tie loosely behind, to which there should be a petticoat sewed, and over this a kind of gown of the same materials, or any other that is light, thin and flimsy. The petticoat should not be
<PB N="9" REF="13" MS="y"/>quite so long as the child, the gown a few inches longer, with one cap only on the head, which may be made double if it be not thought warm enough; what I mean is, that the whole head-dress should be so con∣trived, that it may be put on at once, and neither bind or press the head at all; the linnen may be the same as usual. This I think, would be abundantly sufficient for the day, laying aside all those swathes, bandages, stays, and contrivances, that are most ridiculously used to close, and keep the head in its place, and support the body; as if nature had produced her chief work, a human creature, so carelessly unfinished, as to want those idle aids to make it perfect. Shoes and stockings are not in the least ne∣cessary till the child is able to run about, for they keep the legs wet, and nasty, if they are not changed almost every hour, and often cramp and hurt the feet, besides, a child would stand firmer, and learn to walk much sooner without them. The child should wear a thin flannel shirt during the night, which ought to be every way quite loose: Children in this simple, loose, dress, which may be easily put on and off, without much trouble, would be infinitely easier, and en∣joy a much freer use of their limbs, than when they are loaded, as is too frequently practised, with wrappers, stays, swathes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="10" REF="14" MS="y"/>
<P>Nurses entertain a strange opinion about changing the linnen, and keeping the children clean. They foolishly imagine, that clean linnen, and fresh cloaths, draw away and rob them of their nourishment; on the contrary, they do nothing more than imbibe a little of that moisture, which their bodies exhale, which is of service to them, and therefore their linnen cannot be changed too often, it should be constantly clean eve∣ry day, as it would free them from stinks, and acidities, which are not only offensive, but prejudicial to the tender state of infancy. Every mother who is able, ought to suckle her own child, since it is not only more beneficial to the child, but also conducive to her own health, since forcing back the milk, which most young women have in great plenty, sometimes endangers life, and often lays the foundation of many incurable diseases.</P>
<P>But if from a bad habit of body, want of a sufficient quantity of milk, or any other cause, the mother is incapable of suckling her child, it will be infinitely bet∣ter to procure a wet-nurse, than to attempt to rear the infant by dry-nursing, since not above one in three of the children attempt∣ed to be brought up, by this unnatural and dangerous method, ever survive it.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="11" REF="15" MS="y"/>
<HEAD>Rules proper to be observed in the choice of a Wet-Nurse.</HEAD>
<P>CARE should be taken to chuse a healthy woman, not more than thirty years of age, who has already suckled one child, and who has not lain-in above two or three months, and has plenty of good milk, which is judged to be so, when it is white, full of cream, sweet, and of a moderate consist∣ence; if it be too wheyey or thick, yellow∣ish, salt, hot, or but in a small quantity, it is a sufficient reason to think it bad, and on that account to reject: the nurse. The trials commonly made to determine the quality of the milk, are tasting it, and let∣ting a drop fall into the eyes, when, if it makes the eyes smart, or does not leave a sweetness on the tongue, it is good for no∣thing. We judge of its consistence by the sight, or letting a little of it run into the palm of the hand, and then stroking the other hand upon it, by which it is easily known whether the milk is of a proper consistence. Great regard should be paid to the diet of the nurse: she ought to be very sober and temperate; she should eat one hearty meal of flesh-meat, with a good deal of garden-stuff and bread, every day, broth, milk, tea, or chocolate, are best for
<PB N="12" REF="16" MS="y"/>her breakfast. Her drink should be small-beer, or milk and water; wine and strong-beer should be carefully avoided, since giv∣ing spirituous liquors to a nurse, is, in reali∣ty, giving them to the child, the conse∣quence of which may be easily foreseen. Tho' moderate exercise is, in general, use∣ful in preserving the health of nurses, yet it is impossible to lay down general rules on this subject, as we must of necessity, in this case, comply with their usual custom and disposition. It is commonly thought, that long sleep is advantageous, and can never be prejudicial; but this opinion is wrongly founded, since too long sleep is succeeded by heaviness, stupidity, and me∣lancholy, whereas vivacity, and gaiety of disposition, are qualities constantly required in nurses, which it is impossible to find in a woman who sleeps twelve or fourteen hours every night.</P>
<P>Another error is, that nurses should be absolutely deprived of the conjugal embraces of their husbands, lest they should become pregnant, and the infant, suck bad milk; but since medicinal observations prove, that the frustrating this appetite is attended often with dangerous consequences, and I do not believe, that its being moderately gratified, has been ever attended with the least in∣convenience, with respect to health; I see
<PB N="13" REF="17" MS="y"/>no reason for forbidding nurses the compa∣ny of their husbands, provided that the nurse is changed, if she should prove with child.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the most proper Diet, and the Rules necessary to be observed in Weaning of Children.</HEAD>
<P>THE food of infants on their being weaned, ought certainly to be propor∣tioned to the weakness of their digestive organs, contrary to the opinion of Mr. Locke, who advises children to be ac∣customed to the coarsest aliments, but the inconveniences, and danger attending this method are very evident, since indigestions, and all the disorders arising from them, threaten the infant who is fed with nourish∣ment, which its weak stomach cannot thoroughly digest, since the digestive power is very weak in young children. Their principal nourishment at first should consist of broths, but little seasoned, of the best white bread well baked, of rice gruel, barley broth, water-gruel, panada, or pap made with bread instead of flower: baked
<PB N="14" REF="18" MS="y"/>apples, pears, cherries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this permission must not extend to plums, apricots, peaches, figs, melons, almonds and nuts, which are by repeated observations, found to be very pernicious; they may be allowed bread and butter, now and then, provided the butter be quite sweet and fresh, and all the produce of the kitchen garden, for all these things are wholesome and good for them, not∣withstanding the common notion of their being windy, which they are only to stomachs whose tone is spoilt by the use of high seasoned sauces, ragouts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The child should be weaned when about a twelvemonth old, which the nurse should do by rubbing her nipple with a little aloes, or any other bitter, or drug, which has a strong disagreeable smell, this disgusts the infant, who cries, is uneasy, and frets at the loss of a food he has so long been used to. The nurse must be careful not to let the uneasiness of the child prevail on her to change her resolution, and give the child the breast again, for the disposition of body contracted from hunger, fretting, and crying, will hinder the child from properly digesting the milk, and a vomiting, and troublesome looseness will certainly ensue. The child at first should not be too often fed, nor too much food given it at once, the most proper nourishment will be panada, or rice gruel,
<PB N="15" REF="19" MS="y"/>since the same ill consequences will attend feeding the child too much, as we observed would follow the misguided tenderness of the nurse, in giving suck to children, whom they have begun to wean. 'Tis impossible to use too much precaution in bringing the stomach to loose its habit of digesting no∣thing but milk, the use of which should always be insensibly left off: from milk the child should pass to panada, rice-gruel, or water gruel, from these to broths, and meat by degrees. A mixture ought never to be made of nourishments that are not of the same nature, and of an equal consistence, and particularly nurses ought to observe, not to give the infant more solid food, than can supply by its nutritious particles, the place of the milk it took before. The leanness which accompanies the weaning of children is a salutary change, it is the effect of the emptying of the small vessels, filled with a milky juice, that is to give place to a more nourishing lymph of another nature, and a more solid consistence; reason therefore, here agrees with experience, in convincing us that we are to blame to consider the state of those infants as fatal and dangerous, who become less plump after their being weaned, since most of the diseases children are subject to at the time of their being weaned, are owing to the too great quantity of food
<PB N="16" REF="20" MS="y"/>given them on their being deprived of milk. A looseness, and feverish disorders in young children, are thought to require the use of opiates, but where they proceed from weaning, the use of syrup of diacodion, and other narcotics, cannot be too much con∣demned, as the diet alone, when properly managed, is most useful for the different disorders that happen to infants when they are weaned, for the scurfs, scabs, and other disorders that then arise, will disappear of themselves, if the nurse has patience to wait for it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of Cutting the Teeth.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the fifth or sixth month after the birth, the cutting of the teeth is plainly discovered by the mouth of the infant being overflowed with spittle. Their gums swell, grow red, and inflamed, caused by the growing up of the teeth, which it is necessary to favour, by lessening the resistance of the gums, which oppose their rising up; it is right therefore to compress the gums against the teeth, which are to pass through them, to do which the nurse should pass and
<PB N="17" REF="21" MS="y"/>repass her finger, over the edge of the gums, and press, and rub them more or less strongly, as circumstances may require; for these com∣pressions which are very proper to calm the painful tickling, the infant feels in the gums, answer the principal view with which they are proposed, the forcing a passage through the gums, for the teeth; the infant is so desirous to prevent this disagreeable sensa∣tion, that he gnaws his fingers, and rolls in his mouth, whatever he can get hold of, from this circumstance people have invented the use of corals, which should be tied with a ribband round the waist, to prevent their being lost, or being thrust too far down the child's throat: Breeding of teeth is fatal to many children, but not naturally so, for whatever fits, fever, or other dangerous symptoms, attend this work of nature, are generally the effects of too great fullness, or the corrupt humours of the body put into agitation, by the stimulus of the pain the tooth causes, in forcing its way thro' the gums, which never happens without some pain, and possibly a little fever, but if the blood and juices are perfectly sweet and good, both will be but flight, and pass off imperceptibly without any bad consequence whatever, and healthy children sometimes breed their teeth without any such bad
<PB N="18" REF="22" MS="y"/>attendants, which gives us reason to think the evil is not natural, but commonly brought on thro' the imprudent manage∣ment of the nurse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> On the Diseases of Children in General.</HEAD>
<P>CHILDREN are subject to many diseases, peculiar to the state of infancy, besides those they are liable to in common with grown persons, and whoever examines with attention, those symptoms in children, which plainly occur to the senses, and compares them with the simplicity of their diet, and the extreme delicacy of their con∣stitution, will find that the method of treating the disorders of children with propriety, is by no means so difficult as is commonly imagined, for the diseases of infancy are few in their kind, and differ only in degree from one another. If we consider the nature of the fluids in children, we shall find that they never degenerate from their natural state, into any thing else than an acid acrimony, for whatever disorder they labour under, their excrements have almost always a sour smell, and the same may be observed of
<PB N="19" REF="23" MS="y"/>their belchings, in short all the complaints of infants spring from an acid cause. But little can be learnt in the diseases of infants from their pulse, or urine, our whole in∣telligence must proceed from the nurse; who can easily tell whether the child has been troubled with a vomiting, with restlessness, pains in the belly, sour belchings, hiccups, or cough, whether they are costive or loose, the colour of their stools, whether white, green, or bilious, whether they are remarkably thirsty, and consequently feverish, whether they have the thrush, or convulsions in any part of their bodies, whether there appears any swelling in their belly, or any other part, whether they have any eruptions, or spots on the skin, or whether the skin is yellowish, or red. These enquiries are in general sufficient to enable the persons who have the care of children to prescribe for them with success, for with respect to the pulse, it is in children naturally so very quick and so easily disturbed by the most trifling accident, that persons unacquainted with this circum∣stance, would think them always in a fever. Besides children when sick are so peevish, and fretful, that scarce any of them can be prevailed on to hold their arm steady, long enough for a physician to feel their pulse, in short so many accidents quicken or disturb the circulation of the blood in young
<PB N="20" REF="24" MS="y"/>children, that the judgement from their pulse is too precarious, to be in any respect depended upon. Nor can any thing more certain be gathered from their urine, be∣cause in children in health, it is always very thick, so that any ignorant person upon in∣specting it, would be apt to suspect the child to be very much disordered, while on the contrary he enjoys a perfect, state of health, besides the urine of children is seldom to be examined, unmixed with the excrements. The causes which immediately relate to the production of childrens diseases may be referred to the following heads, 1st. to cold, 2dly. to thick milk, 3dly. to allow∣ing them too early to eat meat, 4thly. to giving them spirituous liquors: Cold catched in the evening, is certainly the occasion of those feverish indispositions, with which children are so often afflicted, therefore proper care should be taken, to provide children with cloaths sufficiently warm, suitable to their age, to defend them from the injuries of the air. Too thick milk may be occasioned from many different causes, but this vitious quality of the milk from whatever cause it arises, must produce many bad effects, and inevitably lay the foundation of fatal obstructions. Persons of all ages should be careful with regard to their diet, but the diet of infants, should
<PB N="21" REF="25" MS="y"/>be managed with the greatest caution, be∣cause they most easily suffer from errors of this kind, and want strength, to resist their pernicious consequences, the using children too soon to eat flesh, is the cause of those indigestions, which constantly attend that voracious age, and if their food be crude, and hard to be digested, their humours must likewise be crude, from whence not only worms will be bred, but a variety also of perplexing, and untoward symptoms, under which they frequently pine and languish. Wine and spirituous liquors are serviceable to old people, to supply the natu∣ral warmth, which is always languid in that state of life, but on this very account, must be prejudicial to children, since they are much warmer than grown persons, and every kind of spirituous liquor, vitiates the tone of their stomach, spoils their appetite, burns up their nerves, and destroys their delicate structure, by continual feverish heats.</P>
<P>To lay a rational foundation for the cure of the diseases incident to infants, the tenderness and weakness of their constitution must be considered, and to these the medi∣cines must carefully be adapted, the milder the remedies made use of, the greater the probability of success, for as their diet is simple, so ought their medicines to be simple too, it has been already observed that most
<PB N="22" REF="26" MS="y"/>of their disorders arise from acidity, the method of cure therefore depends entirely on removing this cause, which is effected by giving them testaceous powders, such as prepared oyster shells, prepared coral, and the like, which are of a perfectly mild nature, and efficaciously absorb any prevalent acidity, they are also anodines, and never fail to give ease to children, when griped, much more certainly than the syrup of white poppies or diacodion, which tho' so often advised by old nurses, can never be given with safety; the only inconvenience attend∣ing the free use of these testaceous powders, is that they are apt to occasion a costiveness, which is always prejudicial to young chil∣dren, the use of them therefore requires every now and then, a little manna, or a sew grains of rhubarb, which is particularly suited to childrens constitutions, for it gently and safely evacuates the febrific matter, purges the stomach and whole body, of any vitiated humours, and restores the tone of the bowels; but perhaps no other remedy, is equal to a fine insipid powder, called Magnesia Alba, which at the same time, that it corrects, and sweetens all acidities, even more effectually than the testaceous powders, is likewise a very gentle purgative, and keeps the body moderately open without
<PB N="23" REF="27" MS="y"/>any other assistance: It may be given children from a scruple to a quarter of an ounce in a day, a little at a time in all their food, till the acidities are quite destroyed, and the disorders arising therefrom entirely removed, it has been very frequently administred with surprizing benefit, even when children have been reduced to the last extremity, by diseases proceeding from acidities, and may be easily procured at almost every apothecaries shop, at a very moderate price.</P>

<P>The cure must be begun by applying a leach behind each ear, and when the swelling of the gum shows it is time to cut it, which is known by a white speck appearing on the swelling, it should be cut quite down to the tooth, with a penknife, instead of a lancet, to prevent its uniting too soon, and forming a hard cicatrix. There can be no danger happen to the child from this operation, but on the contrary, many have died for the want of it. The most effectual method of treating the fever, occasioned by difficult breeding the teeth, is to give the child ac∣cording to its age, from two, to six drops of spirits of hartshorn in a spoonful of any simple water, every four hours, this may be repeated five or six times, the other symp∣toms must be treated as directed under those respective articles.</P>

With regard to vomiting, if the stomach will not retain any kind of food, the child may safely take from one to four or six grains, of powder of ipecacoanha, for this will puke very gently, and does not require so much to be drank after it, as some other vomits do, and yet clears the stomach of crudities, viscidities, and all other bad humours.</P>

<P>When warts disfigure children, they should be removed by touching them every day, with a feather dipped in spirits of sea-salt, and in order to prevent its acting upon the skin around them, care should be taken to cover it with a diachylon plaister, that has a hole in the middle for the wart to come through; this precaution, which is necessary, for warts spread over the surface of the body, ought to be more scrupulously observed, when these excressences are placed on the eye-lids, otherwise, there is danger of destroying the child's sight, by endeav∣ouring to remove a trifling deformity.</P>

It is very necessary, that the mothers or nurses of the lower people, should be more attentive to the fatal consequences of their neglect, for the many children who fall into a dreadful leanness, and at last die of a slow fever, might have been preserv∣ed, had the least care of this sort been taken of them, by the applying a little mercurial ointment to the head, and oftner cutting and combing the hair.</P>
