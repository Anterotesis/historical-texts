<HEAD>PHARMACOMASTIX: OR, THE OFFICE, USE and ABUSE of APOTHECARIES explained, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE PHYSIC alone among all the use∣ful sciences, has at this time the misfortune to be <HI>unrepresented</HI> in Parliament, and as the STATUTE <HI>for preventing Frauds and Abuses in the making and vending unsound, adulterate, and bad Drugs and Medicines;</HI> is now near expiring, I hope it may not be improper to shew the necessity of continuing that Act, and to offer some Amendments thereto, which the artful evasions and corruptions of mercenary artificers have rendered absolutely neces∣sary.</P>
<P>Your early acquaintance with the nature and constitution of Parliaments, your weight in our national Assembly, and your extensive benevolence, have pointed you out the fittest patron and advocate for a Scheme wholely calculated for the public Be∣nefit, to correct the many enormous Abuses in PHARMACY, and consequently to promote the
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>health and temporal happiness of a considerable part of mankind. Therefore I shall venture, without any farther apology, to submit the following lines to your serious consideration.</P>
<P>There is no well regulated country where the LEGISLATURE has not made some provision for the preservation of the health of the <HI>Body natural,</HI> as well as for that of the <HI>Body politic;</HI> yet pity it is, that in most, for want of due Information, all the Laws hitherto enacted in regard to <HI>Medicine,</HI> have fallen far short of it's good intentions. For as an Evil whose source or cause is unknown must be remediless; so is it scarce possible, that the Frauds or Abuses in any art or trade, tho' ever so pernicious to society, can be prevented or punished by law, until they are first discovered and made apparent to the law-givers.—If some of the honest artists or tradesmen of every occupation, would ingenuously disclose the secret corruptions of their respective callings (without which they may for ever escape the cognizance and censure of the LEGISLATURE) we might then hope for a general reformation. But alas! we are too like the <HI>Ephesian smith</HI> in scripture, ready upon every attempt to purge us from iniquity, to cry out with him, <HI>The craft is in danger.</HI></P>
<P>The natural, fragile structure of the human Frame, which has rendered it subject to sundry inevitable vicissitudes, from the force of external bodies, from the alterations of the air, the nature of the aliments, and from the very vital actions, has made the <HI>hecling art</HI> in general, of all others the most useful and necessary for the support and well-being of mankind, and nearly <HI>coaeval</HI> with the Creation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Boerh. Instit. Medic. Prolegom.</NOTE>. So sensible were men in all ages of the usefulness and dignity of Physic, that it has ever been held in the utmost reverence and esteem.
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>The inventors or improvers of this noble art were by the antients ranked among the Gods, and stiled sons of Gods, and the hands of Gods. It was a long time practised by heroes only, or the sons of Gods,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aelian de. animal. lib. ii. cap. 18.</NOTE> being deemed too sacred for prophane hands. The Heathen, Jews and primitive Christians agreed in paying the utmost respect to the healing art, be∣lieving it of divine and heavenly origine<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cicer. Tusculan. Quaest. lib. 3. Hippoc. de pris. medicina S. Aug. de Civit. Dei.</NOTE>. Hence we find the greatest honors possible were conferred on the antient physicians in the most wise, polite, and politic states. They were generally caressed or en∣vied by kings and princes who designed to study, and endeavoured to acquire and practice their in∣estimable art. Many natural productions as well as artificial preparations to this day retain the Name of a royal discoverer or inventor. And two<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mesue &amp; Avicen.</NOTE> of the most considerable antient physical writers whose works are extant at this time, were, one the son of a king, the other a sovereign prince. The <HI>Athenians</HI> so justly prized the worth and excellency of the divine <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> that they initiated him into their grand mysteries; they presented him with the free∣dom of <HI>Athens</HI> in a crown, (a royal diadem) to the value of a thousand pieces of Gold, and set∣tled a considerable stipend for his maintenance during life, at the public expence.—They likewise made a law prohibiting all women, bondsmen, or slaves meddling with Physic: as they did likewise in Locris, which decreed, that disobedience to the directions or prescriptions of Physicians should be punished with death. <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> made all Physicians that should settle in <HI>Rome,</HI> freemen and denizens<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</NOTE>; and when, for some reasons of state, a succeeding emperor banished the <HI>Greeks</HI> that city, yet the Physicians, tho' all <HI>Greeks,</HI> were exempted. It is also observable
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>that the first alien known to obtain his freedom of that once glorious city was a Physician<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arcagathus.</NOTE>. The Physicians of the college of <HI>Milan</HI> are dignified with an order of knighthood, and wear to this day golden Collars<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joh. Bapt. Sylvatic.</NOTE>. Innumerable other instances might be produced, if necessary, to shew, that <HI>medicine</HI> and the <HI>medical sages</HI> were ever respected and esteemed, admired and encouraged, all the World over. See <HI>Celsus,</HI> Senert. <HI>Inst. Med.</HI> Moaebii <HI>Synops. epitom. Inst. Med.</HI> Le Clerc <HI>Hist. de la Medecine.</HI> Friend's <HI>History of Physic.</HI> Harris's <HI>Pharmac-anti-empyr.</HI> and <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f. to</HI> Fuller<HI>'s Pharmacop. extemper.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>healing art</HI> was thus honored in the ruder, early ages, how much does it deserve our regard and attention with the many considerable improve∣ment of the moderns, which were to the antients utterly unknown?</P>
<P>There can hardly be any one insensible of the value of HEALTH and LIFE, since the very first impulse of nature prompts every creature to use all ways and means to preserve them: And nothing but an uninterrupted enjoyment of health can render any man regardless of so invaluable a blessing. It was the dreadful contagion which raged in <HI>Rome</HI> about the 301st year after the building that city, where there were not then found Physicians enough to attend the sick<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dion. Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>carnas.</NOTE>, that first made the robust <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> sensible of the Use and Excellency of PHYSIC, which they afterwards so generously incouraged, and so amply rewarded. <HI>Salus populi suprema lex esto,</HI> is a precept which was once religiously observed, in its fullest extent, by every worthy <HI>Roman</HI> senator. And tho' it might not have been originally pro∣nounced or received in this sense literally, yet I ap∣prehend the application of it merely to the bodily
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>health of the people, can be no wide deviation from the sense of the wise author; since the general well∣fare of the community depends upon the health of it's Members.</P>
<P>PHYSIC or MEDICINE is the art by which our lives and health are preserved and restored. And abuses or mal-administration in any branch thereof must necessarily prejudice or subvert the whole. This cannot be charged upon <HI>Physic</HI> or <HI>Chirurgery,</HI> for it may in truth be affirmed, that this Kingdom was never so happily provided in that way, as at present, with men of both professions inferior to none in <HI>Europe,</HI> in erudition, judgement, and probity. But PHARMACY, or the <HI>apothecary's art</HI> in parti∣cular, which ministers in an especial manner to the two former branches, namely <HI>Physic</HI> and <HI>Chirurgery;</HI> tho' the good success of both most considerably depends thereupon, is lest neglected and un∣cultivated, over-run with <HI>errors, abuses</HI> and <HI>frauds.</HI> And tho' there are no corruptions in any art so per∣nicious and destructive to the public, as those of <HI>Apothecaries,</HI> yet (melancholly consideration!) none are so little liable to discovery or punishment. Deceits in most trades are perceptible to the gene∣rality, and are not only in some sense cognizable by law, but as they must sooner or later be discover∣ed by the customers, common policy will direct most tradesmen to some integrity in their callings. But as the most baneful frauds in <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> being never suspected, are seldom or never perceptible to the public, tho' often felt, (few or none besides <HI>Physicians, Chirurgeons,</HI> or <HI>Apothecaries,</HI> being sensible of the evils in this way,) so none transgresses with more case and security, than the dishonest apothe∣cary. He may destroy the reputation of the most careful and judicious physicians and chirurgeons, and murder thousands of their patients, his bill is never∣theless paid, and he is still unsuspectedly entertain∣ed, caressed and employed by the surviving Fami∣lies.
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>A little artifice can tinsel or varnish over the most vile <HI>frauds</HI> or <HI>perfidious neglects</HI> of the <HI>unjust apothecary.</HI> If he can command a brazen front, with an hardened, servile conscience, it is enough, all is safe. For his <HI>vassal apprentices,</HI> who only can be privy to his villainy, are hushed, they are obliged to keep his <HI>secrets</HI> without distinction.</P>
<P>AS PHARMACY is a most useful and necessary art, nay, according to one of the fathers of physic<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Celsus. See J. D. Horst. Inst. pharmac. L. ii. C. i.</NOTE>, <HI>the most useful branch of medicine,</HI> when in a state of purity and perfection, so it is the most <HI>pernicious</HI> and <HI>destructive,</HI> when it is not exercised with the utmost integrity, care, fidelity and good under∣standing. No knave so vile, so dangerous to society as a bad apothecary. The rapacious highwayman, a professed <HI>enemy</HI> to mankind, bids the unwary tra∣veller stand and at the peril of his life part with his money: But the dishonest apothecary, a more subtil kind of robber, pretends a <HI>friendship</HI> for his Custo∣mer, yet takes the same opportunity with the former (which the love of life and health, and dread of death that human Nature is possessed with, amply affords him,) and so robs thousands of their fortunes, giving them only some vile, useless drug in ex∣change; by which their lives are always endan∣gered and often destroyed. And yet notwithstand∣ing the apothecary is never in the least suspected; so that the orphan may oft pay him for the death of his parents, parents for that of their children, wi∣dows for their husbands, and so forth: and perhaps gratefully acknowledge the great care and tenderness of their <HI>worthy apothecary,</HI> tho' he might have been more instrumental to their death than the disease.</P>
<P>For these reasons, the apothecaries have no tem∣poral advantages in, nor any incitements to honesty or integrity in their calling. For while men can buy the most base and worst commodities, and may
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>without detection, substitute them for, or sell them at the same rate with the best and most genuine, we shall probably be infested with such mercenary wretches as will prefer their own ill-gotten gain, to a clear conscience and the safety and welfare of their neighbours; <HI>the far greater profit arising from illegal trade.</HI></P>
<P>I would not be hereby thought to charge all the worthy apothecaries of this kingdom, with igno∣rance, disingenuity, or disintegrity; far be it from me! I am well assured that we have some, as ju∣dicious, as skilful, and as honest in their way, as any in <HI>Europe.</HI> But as it may not be allowable to point at the indentical guilty persons, either by naming the one, or exempting the other, so I am obliged to make the charge in general against the whole fraternity, my self not excepted. So <HI>let him whom the cap fits wear it</HI>—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shakespear's. Hamlet.</NOTE> let <HI>the galled jade wince.</HI>—It is thro' a real concern for the just, good men, that are indiscriminately blended with the unjust, and for the scandalous disrepute which the excellent art of <HI>Pharmacy</HI> is fallen into, toge∣ther with the long train of evils which attend the public in general, from the base craft and corrupti∣on of avaricious falsifiers of medicines, that I am urged to this work.</P>
<P>I have a long time had a conflict with myself about this important undertaking. I must confess I some time feared the united powers of the wicked a∣gainst me, having on the like occasion heretofore, fatally experienced the strength of the <HI>confederate Opponents of reformation:</HI> And above all, I avoided taking upon me a task, to which I am conscious of, and confess my inequality. But at length laying a∣side all selfish fear, and finding none of the many more capable inclined to engage in such a just and necessary <HI>warfare,</HI> I have at all hazards presumed
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>to give you the following informations, and to sub∣mit these just (tho' indigested) Observations to the wisdom of the LEGISLATURE; from whose pater∣nal care and benevolence alone, we may expect the due encouragement of <HI>Virtue,</HI> and the suppression of <HI>Vice</HI> of every kind. If my weak endeavours answer any useful purposes, I have my full recom∣pence in being but ever so mean an Instrument of effecting a public good. I hope the merits of the Cause, for which I am but a slender advocate, and the simplicity and honesty of mine intentions, will gain your attention, plead for the weakness of my performance, and supply the want of <HI>Rhetoric</HI> and <HI>Oratory.</HI></P>
<P>In order to lay this matter properly before you, I judge it expedient,</P>
<P N="1">I. To consider the rise and primitive state of <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> and from the best authority to point out the proper <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> of, and the requisite <HI>Qualifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations</HI> for an <HI>Apothecary.</HI> In which I shall c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsorily endeavour to explain the difference between <HI>Apothecaries</HI> and <HI>Druggists.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. To shew the present state of <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> and how far the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dern deviate from the <HI>proper Office</HI> and <HI>Duty,</HI> and fall short of the <HI>qualifications</HI> of the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tient true <HI>Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ries;</HI> in which fatal degeneracy it will appear, that it is scarcely possible for a man to learn that Art <HI>fully,</HI> and then to get an <HI>honest</HI> livelihood by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t profession <HI>solely,</HI> let his know∣ledge and understanding in it be ever so consider∣able, unless he had the good fortune of an extraordi∣nary genius, which may lead him to study it properly, and of ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning a set of customers who pay un∣common deference to his judgement and integrity.</P>
<P N="3">III. To lay open some of the most inconsidera∣ble and obvious <HI>Frauds</HI> and <HI>Abuses</HI> in this way, whe∣ther thro' <HI>ignorance</HI> or <HI>design</HI> of Apothecaries or Druggists; and to point out some of the most per∣nicious
<PB N="11" REF="11"/><HI>sophistications</HI> of Medicines, with the evil consequences thereof. And</P>
<P N="4">IV. and lastly, To offer some means to prevent such horrid mal-practices for the future; whereby the KING is not only basely defrauded in his just Revenue, by which every Subject must suffer; but also the PUBLIC is robbed of the chief blessing of this life, Health, and the means of restoring it; and the fair and honest Apothecary is crampt and restrained in the lawful discharge of his function; being undersold by the fraudulent and dishonest.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the pure, primitive ages of the <HI>healing Art,</HI> the <HI>physician</HI> not only <HI>prescribed,</HI> but <HI>collected, pre∣pared dispensed,</HI> and <HI>administred medicaments,</HI> as well as <HI>performed chirurgical operations.</HI> For the <HI>now</HI> three distinct branches of <HI>Medicine,</HI> called <HI>Physic, Pharmacy,</HI> and <HI>Chirurgery,</HI> were (till about the time of <HI>Herophilus</HI> and <HI>Erasistratus</HI>) managed by one and the same hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cels. Pref. l. i. Le. Clerc. hist. de la Med. p. ii l. i. c. ix.</NOTE>. But finding it too laborious and burdensome, and according to a trite aphorism of the <HI>father</HI> of <HI>Physic,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hippoc. Lib. i. Aph. i.</NOTE> that <HI>the lise of man was too short to comprehend fully, or to compleat the know∣ledge of that sublime Art,</HI> it was judged expedient to divide it into these three different parts, that having less to study in each, it might become less tedious and prolix, insomuch that every student may hope to arrive at a competent degree of know∣ledge in that branch which he chose for his peculiar stu∣dy: Whereupon the three distinct offices of <HI>Physician, Apothecary,</HI> and <HI>Chirurgeon,</HI> were instituted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Physicians,</HI> on account of <HI>seniority</HI> and <HI>super∣lative erudition,</HI> are justly allowed the <HI>pre-eminence</HI> of the two other brethren, which, indeed, I think that profession merits of all others, divinity only excepted. A Physician must have a most liberal edu∣cation: He must be well versed in all the learned
<PB N="12" REF="12"/><HI>languages,</HI> in <HI>natural history,</HI> in all parts of <HI>Phi∣losophy,</HI> in <HI>Anatomy, the animal Oeconomy, the histo∣ries of distempers, their natures, signs, Symptoms, causes, diagnostics, prognostics,</HI> indications of <HI>Cure,</HI> &amp;c. He must likewise be well grounded in the <HI>theories</HI> of the <HI>Chemic</HI> and <HI>Galenic pharmacies</HI> and of <HI>chirurgery.</HI> For according to the wise <HI>author</HI> of <HI>medicine,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hippoc. lex.</NOTE> <HI>natural endowments, learning, a proper place for study, education from infancy, industry and time, are requisite to constitute a physician;</HI> in conse∣quence of which we find, the education of such is in schools and universities, seminaries of polite lite∣rature, where all things are learned to compleat the physician and the gentleman. Thus must a <HI>physician</HI> be qualified before he can undertake the care of the sick in any, the slightest disorder: And he who made the greatest progress in that admirable art, even the <HI>divine sage,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hippoc. Epist. ad Democrit.</NOTE> is not ashamed to confess, that <HI>tho' he was now advanced in old age, and got to the extremity of life, he had not yet arrived at the end of physic.</HI> Whence it follows that physic is the deep∣est and most extensive study, and it's practice the weightiest and most important charge, that human nature can possibly undertake.</P>
<P>CHIRURGERY now <HI>usurps</HI> the second rank; and tho' it has had a worse fate than physic, in falling some time into the hands of ignorant and illiterate men, yet it's knowledge is again happily revived a∣mong us, and all those who make a figure in that profession, are not only men of learning and erudi∣tion, but inferior to none in <HI>Europe</HI> in judgement and understanding in that excellent art.</P>
<P>For some centuries <HI>Chirurgery</HI> <SUP>1</SUP> as well as <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> <SUP>2</SUP> <NOTE N="1-2." PLACE="foot"> Friend's Hist. Phys Vol. 2. p. iii.</NOTE> was <HI>subservient and ministerial</HI> to PHY∣SIC.

<PB N="13" REF="13"/>the division of <HI>Medicine</HI> into these three branches, being taught by the PHYSICIANS,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ou Medicins Architect. ibid.</NOTE> were by them solely directed and conducted in the exercise and discharge of their respective functions. So that the <HI>then Chirurgeons</HI> never bled, opened tumours, amputated limbs, nor performed any other opera∣tion in their profession; nor did the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> apply, or administer any medicine, but in con∣sultation with or by the advice or approbation of the <HI>Physicians.</HI> Yet as it is now essentially ne∣cessary to compleat a <HI>Chirurgeon,</HI> that he be a man of learning, a perfect master of anatomy and of course well acquainted with the animal oeconomy, and his object being one, and his practice being grounded on the same principles and <HI>rationale</HI> with Physic, (with this only distinction, that one treats the ex∣ternal, the other the internal disorders of the human Body,) it does not seem unreasonable, that <HI>such Chirurgeons,</HI> should bleed and perform other opera∣tions in that way, and even prescribe, especially ex∣ternal applications, upon their own Judgement solely.</P>
<P>But the case is quite otherwise with <HI>Apothecaries:</HI> For altho' they should be good scholars, and ne∣cessarily conversant with the writings of the learn∣ed who treated on their profession, yet does their <HI>requisite Readings</HI> no where instruct them in anato∣my, or the animal oeconomy, nor in any of the many other necessary qualifications of physicians, or chirurgeons, the knowledge of the <HI>Materia medica</HI> only excepted, the apothecary's office, his very appellation in all the known languages denotes. Thus among the antients, <HI>Medicus sellularis</HI> implied an apothecary or one who prepared and dispensed medicines. As did likewise <HI>Pharmaceuta</HI> and <HI>Medicamentarius.</HI> In like manner <HI>Apothecarius</HI> an apothecary from <HI>Apotheca,</HI> a shop, ware-house or
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>repository, or (in the more common acceptation,) a place where drugs or medicines are kept or sold; and he may be aptly called a <HI>Physic-Shop-keeper:</HI> also <HI>Pharmacopaeus,</HI> a maker, preparer or compound∣er of medicines. And likewise <HI>Seplasiarius,</HI> from <HI>Seplasia,</HI> a market-place in <HI>Capua,</HI> once a famed mart for drugs and perfumed ointments. And the sole proper business and office of an Apothecary, is, to <HI>collect</HI> or <HI>procure</HI> at due times and seasons, from the proper places, <HI>the several, usual medicinal pro∣ductions</HI> of <HI>Nature, the simples of the Mineral, ve∣getable and animal Kingdoms; to select</HI> and <HI>prepare,</HI> to <HI>decompound</HI> or <HI>compound them according to Art,</HI> by the directions of <HI>Physicians,</HI> and by their prescripti∣ons only, <HI>to dispense, administer,</HI> or <HI>apply them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Renod.

The <HI>Pharmacopolae</HI> of the antients seem to have been such as were employed by artists in collecting or procuring the simples; they were mere venders of drugs, and pretended to no art or knowledge beyond that; but as these men in time degenerated into knaves or quacks, they became hateful to society, and the name of <HI>Pharmacopola,</HI> with most writers since implies, a <HI>canting hawker, a false quack,</HI> or <HI>a deceitful mounte∣bank.</HI> How applicable this appellation, in the <HI>worst sense,</HI> may be to some <HI>dealers</HI> in <HI>medicine,</HI> who call themselves <HI>Druggists,</HI> I shall not here determine; but
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>we have the satisfaction to observe, that that trade is a∣gain revived; for in <HI>London, Marseilles, Amsterdam, Rot∣terdam, Leghorn, Hamburgh,</HI> and most other regular trading cities in <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Druggist</HI> is none other than a mere <HI>Merchant</HI> of <HI>Drugs,</HI> and in the <HI>best sense</HI> of the word, <HI>Pharmacopola.</HI></P>
<P>So different a profession from <HI>Physic</HI> was <HI>Pharmacy</HI> deemed, that not above a century passed, since the Grocers Company in <HI>London</HI> dispensed medicines. But it was at length found expedient, that some should separate from that body, who should take upon them the entire management of the medicinal part of that trade, that by applying themselves sole∣ly to an affair of so great importance to the public, they might cultivate and attain to a competent know∣ledge in so useful and necessary an art. Whereupon Pharmacy was revived, and the Apothecaries throw∣ing off all incumbrances, betook them to their pro∣per profession, in which they soon became eminent, were taken notice of, and encouraged by the learned, and grew into such favour with King <HI>James</HI> the First, that he incorporated them by Royal Charter, and used to call them <HI>his own company.</HI> Thus they became a distinct society from the grocers.</P>
<P>The illustrious college of physicians of <HI>Augsburgh,</HI> which was the first, that I find, who took the pains of compiling, and published the celebrated <HI>Augustane Dispensatory,</HI> has most minutely and justly laid down <HI>the qualifications for and the office and duty of an Apo∣thecary,</HI> from whom, with some few amendments from other authentic writers, I make the following abstract.</P>
<P><HI>As</HI> PHARMACY <HI>is a most considerable branch of the</HI> HEALING ART, <HI>being the physician's chief agent, so the apothecary should be a just good man, and principally grounded in the knowledge of his profession.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He should in general be untainted in his morals, and of a perfect sound understanding, endowed with a just reve∣rence for the</HI> SUPREME BEING, <HI>and the true principles
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>of the</HI> CHRISTIAN RELIGTON; <HI>pious and faithful, just and equitable; humane, benign, affable, placable, merciful and ready; mild and bountiful to the poor and indi∣gent; ever preferring publick to private gains; vigilant and regardful of the dangers and necessities of the sick; in acts of mercy and charity, diligent and unwearied; not covetous, penurious, or mercenary; for in buying of drugs, he is to prefer the testimony of a clear conscience, the good of his neighbour, and his own credit and reputation, to ill gotten riches or lucre. Wherefore, he is to procure ge∣mine good drugs and medicines at any rate, rather than by buying at the vilest, dispense adulterate or bad medicines, and deceive his unwary customer to the peril or prejudice of his life or health. He should be sober and regular in all his conduct; no gamester, sot, or drunkard; nor prone to libidinous concupiscence or venery.</HI></P>
<P>These premised, his capacity is next to be consi∣dered. <HI>He must not only have a strong natural genius to lead him to this art, but he must be a good scholar, to ina∣ble him to read the ordinary prescripts of physicians and chirurgeons, which</HI> (from the difficulty of translating them with any certainty into the vulgar tongues, and for other obvious reasons,) <HI>are all over</HI> Europe <HI>wrote in</HI> Latin, <HI>and especially, that he may acquire a thorough knowledge of his profession, by consulting the works of the learned, who treat upon the several branches thereof.</HI></P>
<P>The Authors recommended, <HI>are Dioscorides, Galen, Aegineta, Aetius, Mesue, Nich. Proepositus</HI> and <HI>Myrep∣fius, Pliny, Corn. Celsus, A. M. Brasavolus, Valer. Cor∣dus, Anut.

<PB N="17" REF="17"/>Mynsicht, the Hoffmans, Clusius, Piso, Bontius, Marcgravius, Wedelius, Le Mort, Dale, Stahl, Boerhaave, and many others; besides the several col∣legiate dispensatories of Augsburgh, London, Brux∣els, Edinburgh, Paris, Leyden, Plague, Ghaunt, <HI>&amp;c. from these the apothecary can best learn the medicinal parts of the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, with their proper n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es and synonyma in the</HI> Arabic, Greek, Latin, <HI>and vulgar tongues: These will teach him to discern the good from the bad, and to select the true and genuine, from the false and sophisticated: and in short, from them he can collect the generic marks and characteristics of the simple, with proper instructions for preparing, and necessary animadversions on, the compound medicaments.</HI></P>
<P>Having laid these solid foundations for his future practice, his Oeconomy comes next under conside∣ration.</P>
<P><HI>His shop should be situate in a convenient, open, temperate place, not exposed to damps, winds, dust, smoke, or stench.</HI> And as it contains sundry distilled liquors, wines or vinous infusions, tinctures and si∣rups, electuaries, consections and conserves, which too much heat will render vapid or mothery, fer∣ment, sour, or otherwise spoil; and which excessive cold will chill and freeze, congeal, crystallize, or o∣therwise prejudice: A vintner need hardly observe a greater exactness or regularity in adjusting the temperature of his cellar or vault, than an Apo∣thecary should in that of his shop or store-room. Wherefore he should avoid the extreme heat of the sun, which on one hand he is exposed to, all the summer months, and on the other, the extraordi∣nary cold of the winter: For which reasons, that aspect is most eligible which affords the greatest mediocrity. Nor should it be exposed in any, to the many inconveniences and evils of open un∣glassed windows and doors, nor made more intem∣perate by fires made on particular occasions only, either in summer or winter.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
<P><HI>And that the medicines may be handled cleanly and neatly, (those for internal use more especially, which are taken with the greater reluctance and disdain, the more sordidly they are observed to be treated) the Apo∣thecary is to keep his shop and utensils sweet, pure, and clean; and with indefatigable diligence, furnish it with the usual commodities at due seasons, and preserve them for future use in fit receptacles and convenient places.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He is not to sell or administer, nor suffer, or cause to be administered to any, (without the immediate li∣cence of a Magistrate, or the prescription of a judicious Physician) any sort of poyson or poysonous drugg, philtres, provocatives of terms or abortion, opium or laudanum, strong vomitives or purgatives, nor other such like powerful medicines, especially the Chemical preparations of Mercury and Antimony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He should be strictly just and faithful, cautious and circumspect, in the dispensing and preparing the ordina∣ry prescriptions of Physicians, as well as the officinal compositions. Nor should he rashly or conceitedly, sub∣stitute any one thing for another in a medicine, trust∣ing to his own judgement or knowledge, nor omit the least or meanest ingredient hi any composition whatsoever, without the advice, consent, or approbation of the pre∣scriber, or some other skilful, prudent physician. But with religious fidelity, care and integrity, dispense all prescripts in quality and quantity, truly and exactly, according to the literal sense of such prescript or recipe. He is to keep an exact registry of all such recipe's, and the originals, carefully filed. He is to keep such as are for se∣cret complaints from being exposed. He is to repeat no medicine without the direction of the prescriber.</HI> See prolegom. Isagog. in <HI>pharmac. August.</HI> Cap. i. I. D. Horstij <HI>Inst. pharmaceut.</HI> Part. i. Cap. ii.

<P>So sensible were the wise senate of <HI>Augsbourg</HI> of the use and necessity of these rules, that they made some excellent laws, as well to inforce the observati∣on thereof, as to regulate the practices of physic,
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>pharmacy and chirurgery in every other instance: And the senate of <HI>Ghaunt</HI> also took much the like method.</P>
<P>Among other statutes it is enacted, <Q>"That no apothecary, shall so far swerve from his duty, as to interfere with the proper office of a physi∣cian or chirurgeon; and that none presumes to sell or administer medicines (strong purgatives and provocatives especially) without the prescripti∣on of a physician; lest by the rash, ill-judged, or un∣timely use of the most efficacious remedies, the health of the public may suffer, and the best medicines fall into contempt and disrepute; phy∣sicians only being the proper judges of the fit subjects and just times of administering such remedies." — "The apothecaries are obliged to prepare and compound all their medicines by the college dispensatory,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the King's proclamat. prefixed to the <HI>London</HI> dispensat.</NOTE> and to sell them at the rates fixed by the senate." "All quacks, em∣pirics, mountebanks, and such like impostors and pretenders to medicine whatsoever, not found le∣gally qualified, are expelled the state."</Q> See the decrees and statutes of the senates of <HI>Augsbourg</HI> and <HI>Ghaunt,</HI> annexed to their several dispensatories.</P>
<P>The apothecaries of <HI>Paris</HI> are obliged, not only <HI>to conform to the dispensatory, strictly and literally,</HI> but are likewise <HI>prohibited to vend or administer a∣ny medicines whatsoever, without the prescription of one of the faculty of medicine or one of the King's physicians.</HI> See an arret of parliament prefixed to the <HI>Parisian</HI> dispensatory.</P>
<P>Nothing assuredly can contribute more to the im∣provement and benefit of the healing art, than the professors of the different branches thereof; applying themselves entirely to the study and practice of their respective callings. And this was certainly the wise design of our predecessors in dividing it into those
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>three several parts; and were it yet further subdivided, it is probable it might be brought to greater certain∣ty and rendered more generally beneficial to man∣kind, than it can be in an aggregate state; since the meanest branch can sufficiently employ the whole attention and understanding of a man. We find that many of the antients were of this opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herodot. L. ii. S. 84.</NOTE>, and that it was approved by the late celebrated doctor <HI>Harris</HI> of <HI>London</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pharm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c. Anti-Empiric. p. 217.</NOTE>. What considerable discoveries and improvements have already been made in phy∣sic in general by these divisions, are very obvious to all that are conversant with the history of medicine. <HI>Physicians</HI> by appointing <HI>proper agents</HI> for the more <HI>operose</HI> and <HI>mechanic</HI> parts of their profession, threw off all incumbrance and obtained more time and leisure for study. <HI>Chirurgery</HI> was cultivated un∣der the same management and both have arrived at the extraordinary pitch of eminence we now see them in, under these wise Regulations. <HI>Pharmacy</HI> too, while it kept within the proper bounds, shone and flourished; for it is observable, that no set of men made a better figure in their way than the apothe∣caries that retained their integrity and kept within the just limits of their Occupation; which the works of many of them amply testify. Of these are <HI>Ferrantes Imperatus</HI> a <HI>Neapolitan,</HI> who wrote a most excellent natural history, 28 books in <HI>folio; John Parkinson</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who wrote the <HI>Theatrum Botanicum</HI> and <HI>Paradisus Terrestris; Thomas Johnson</HI> of the same, who emaculated and augmented <HI>Gerard's Herbal,</HI> all in large <HI>folio; Moses Charas</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> who wrote a very useful dispensatory, in large <HI>quarto; Peter Pomet</HI> of the same, <HI>a mere druggist,</HI> who wrote a history or drugs in <HI>folio; M. Lemery,</HI> who wrote a course of <HI>Chemy</HI> in <HI>octavo,</HI> an universal dispensatory, and a dictionary of drugs in large
<PB N="21" REF="21"/><HI>quarto;</HI> and <HI>M. Homberg,</HI> who made many improve∣ments and discoveries in the Pharmacies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Memoires de l'Acad. Roy. de Sciences.</NOTE>, who were both honoured for their eminence with the degree of <HI>doctor of medicine.</HI> At present Mr. <HI>Joseph Miller</HI> and Mr. <HI>Isaac Rand</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> deserve honourable mention; as do Messieurs <HI>Bolduc</HI> and <HI>Geoffroy</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> whose worth and merit none can be a stranger to, who reads the memoirs of the <HI>Aca∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my Royal of Sciences.</HI> I have reserved to bring up the rear, the brightest ornament of his profession, the late learned and ingenious Mr. SAMUEL DALE, whose excellent <HI>Pharmacol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gia</HI> has rendered him well known to all the physical world. For tho' he lived in <HI>Brantry</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> yet was his merit so well known to the illustrious college of physicians of <HI>London,</HI> that before he published the last edition of his works, which he greatly augmented and im∣proved, he was honored with a licence to practise physic. With him let me remember that great and laborious artist and curious naturalist, SEBA of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> whose prodigious <HI>Musaeum</HI> with the history thereof, five large volumes in <HI>folio,</HI> must render his memory famous to latest posterity.</P>
<P N="2">II. While <HI>Pharmacy</HI> was practised by such able hands as those, <HI>Physic</HI> which has so great a depen∣dence upon it, must have flourished. But such be∣came the insatiable avarice of most of the <HI>apotheca∣ries,</HI> that they could not long content themselves with the ample profit that arose upon the sale of their proper commodities and manufactures; but envious of their elder brethren of the faculty of physic, they now endeavoured to imitate them, as the frogs in the fable did the oxen, (and indeed with much the same success) and sought after new methods of increasing their sordid gains. This they effected by treacherously and surreptitiously invading the provinces of <HI>physicians</HI> and <HI>chirurgeons,</HI> and
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>alluring the populace under the specious pretence of giving <HI>advice</HI> in physic and chirurgery <HI>gratis.</HI> Which fatal delusion readily insnared the ignorant vulgar, who could not be sensible of their gross ig∣norance and manifest incapacity for such an under∣taking, nor apprehend that these very bountiful gentry, took care to tax their medicines with their invaluable advice; so that their prescriptions (of which it must be confessed they are always most li∣beral) are now charged infinitely more than their real value, or what those of physicians and chirur∣geons, (tho' of more intrinsic worth, being certainly better adapted to particular exigencies, to the con∣stitution and the indications of cure,) might be made up and sold for. And thus by iniquitously enhancing the prices of remedies and giving them in unneces∣sary abundance, they clandestinely acquired unme∣rited fees, equal to those justly due to the most regularly educated and most experienced physicians or chirurgeons.</P>
<P>That this is the present case, every intelligent, candid apothecary must confess. And these fallacies might be further evinced beyond dispute, were the generality to be made sensible of the just rates of medicines and the most monstrous, extravagant bills they are frequently charged. To see two drachms of <HI>Sal p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unel</HI> not worth a penny, disguised with some insignificant color, and an unintelligible, pompous title, and sold for sixteen pence, must surely move your contempt and indignation! Who with∣out abhorrence and surprize, could see sham: <HI>Gasgoin</HI>'s <HI>powder,</HI> without a grain of bezoar, sold at five shilling the drachm, when (by omitting that only dear ingredient) it could not have cost the maker one penny? Yet these and many such like imposi∣tions are daily pract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed by mercenary quacks, and by them judged necessary and their undoubted right, on accompt of <HI>their extraordinary skill, great care, frequent visits, and trouble in attending and pre∣scribing.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>I have known a gentleman's bill, who sickened on <HI>Monday</HI> and died the <HI>Wednesday</HI> follow∣ing, amount to above five pounds, tho' his careful apothecary had but a street's breadth to cross be∣tween his shop and the patient's lodging. It is more than probable, that if the <HI>unhappy sufferer</HI> took to the value of his bill in medicines, it was the cause of his death, and would, tho' he had the most athletic constitution; but to acquit his apothecary of <HI>this murder,</HI> every one of the profession must con∣fess, that no man could well require or consume medicines to that value in the time. Then what physician could expect so much for his attendance in the ordinary manner for so long?</P>
<P>It must be allowed that all artists have a just right to charge upon their wares, the necessary ex∣pences and trouble that attend the preparing and vending them; but those of apothecaries in the sale of their commodities without doors, they have unnecessarily and unjustly brought upon themselves, for the most part; so let the world judge their me∣rit, in imposing such an iniquitous tax upon the public.</P>
<P>Some perhaps will in good-nature, urge in favour of their worthy apothecary, <HI>that for a bill of ten pounds he is often put off with five or six.</HI> A modest, humble creature! His merit as well as demerit, is best known to himself.—It is true some apothe∣caries may think themselves well paid with half their bill, and it is not improbable they often are too well. For while they can swell their accounts to what size they please, by the quantities of medicines they prescribe, and charging what they will, it is likely care will be taken to suit the bill to the humor of the customer, so that if he should pay but a fourth part, they are sure to be no losers. But which of them will remit one penny of their bill on their own accord, be it ever so highly rated, to such as do not wrangle for it? And is not whatso∣ever
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>ever they receive over and above the real value of the medicines <HI>justly</HI> disposed of, the most base and wicked extortion? — Such <HI>apothecaries</HI> would probably join in the impious breathings of GARTHS <HI>Diasenna,</HI> if they thought their goods were too low rated.</P>
<Q><L>Thrice happy were those golden days of old,</L>
<L>When dear as <HI>Burgundy</HI> ptisans were sold;</L>
<L>When patients chose to die with better will,</L>
<L>Than live to pay th' apothecary's bill.</L>
<L>And cheaper than for our assistance call,</L>
<L>Might go to <HI>Aix</HI> or <HI>Bourbon</HI> spring and fall.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Dispensatory,</HI> Cant. iii.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The extraordinary, unlimited gain arising from these horrid usurpations, has now tempted the apo∣thecaries utterly to forsake their proper and imme∣diate office and duty. For instead of pursuing the true means of learning <HI>pharmacy,</HI> (reading the Works of the celebrated writers upon that subject, such being generally in <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin,</HI> languages to which most dealers in drugs are entire strangers,) they have totally neglected and forsaken it, and in the room of such authors furnished themselves with only some vile <HI>English dispensatory,</HI> the despicable <HI>cob-webs</HI> of some poor illiterate wretch, who quacked for a livelihood and spun these paultry traps for ig∣norant, unwary <HI>Flies.</HI> Such were the memorable <HI>star-mongers</HI> and voluminous <HI>quacks, Culpeper</HI> and <HI>Salmon,</HI> and the erroneous, conceited <HI>scriblers, Quincy</HI> and <HI>Alleyne;</HI> whose <HI>dispensatories, practices of physic,</HI> and other such like fallacious <HI>quack-books,</HI> (which will not bear reading by any that have read the originals, being calculated only for such mean, illiterate reptiles, as addict themselves to that vile, pernicious Trade of quacking,) can but prompt a man to think he understands physic, and practise it, when a better education must convince him of the
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>contrary, and make him tremble at the thoughts of the stupendous task.</P>
<P>Thus has <HI>Pharmacy</HI> been <HI>perverted</HI> and <HI>debased.</HI> For tho' held by the antients <HI>in the second rank,</HI> yet is it now deemed the <HI>last</HI> and <HI>meanest</HI> of the three branches; and indeed under the present mismanage∣ment and depravity, it may of all trades be reckoned the vilest and most despicable; and instead of being useful, it is become apparently destructive to society. A footman or porter may now a-days pass for an apothecary, we see shops daily served and attended by such, or ignorant women. I have known an apothecary's shop served by a journey man of a cer∣tain mean mechanic trade, who knew not a letter in the alphabet. Nay, a wretch who conversed more with brutes than men; the stable-tender or groom of a certain eminent apothecary, has been exalted from rubbing of horses heels, to attending his master's table, and thence to wiping of compters and pounding mortars; and being translated from his master's to a shop of his own, acquired so much craft as to pass for an apothecary, lived in repute among his neighbours for many years, and died not long since in very considerable circumstances. Hence the calling is become so vile and scandalous, that few, besides the meaner sort, put their children to learn it, and so contemptible are those after a most servile and tedious apprenticeship, that a journeyman taylor, or shoemaker, or any of the meanest handy-craft trades, shall get better wages than a journey man apothecary, of ever so good un∣derstanding in his profession, the most ignorant being capable of serving most of our common shops, which consists chiefly in retailing medicines made up by a <HI>nominal druggist,</HI> as incapable of preparing, as an <HI>apothecary</HI> of <HI>prescribing</HI> them justly; or bought from a poor, ignorant herb-gatherer, who both frequently sell one thing for another of ever so dif∣ferent qualities, which impositions are implicitly
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>over-looked by master and man; neither thinking the knowledge of simple or compound medicines material, or necessary, nor their preparation or composition his proper occupation, they lay them∣selves out for practising physic and chirurgery; for which as well as their own profession, the reading a false <HI>English dispensatory</HI> is reckoned a sufficient qua∣lification. So, quacking being the principal business of a <HI>modern apothecary,</HI> he generally goes thro' that himself, therefore needs no judicious <HI>emanuensis,</HI> any raw-boy being soon made capable of the ordinary business of his shop; for which reason, rather than pay journeyman's wages, apprentices are multiplied at any rate, and at all hazards. Whence we come to have more apothecaries' <HI>shops</HI> than any city in <HI>Europe</HI> in proportion: We are within eight or ten equal in number with those of <HI>Paris,</HI> which I think is allowed to be six times as populous as <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>But this fatal degeneracy has now made such a progress, that we really forget or know not what we should be. For regardless of the worth and dignity of our art and of the public benefit, the apothecaries have neglected and abandoned it, and in the vain pursuit of another, (like <HI>Aesop</HI>'s dog) <HI>quitted the real substance for an empty shadow;</HI> so, losing their art, have dwindled into vile, fallacious quacks, vain and audacious pretenders to physic and chirurgery, and destructive hawkers of medicine. The very method of educating youth in this calling, is either quite forgotten, or, so far perverted and changed from what it must have been heretofore, that it is by great accident if ever we happen to see any one of common understanding in that profession▪ few having more than the undeserved name of <HI>apo∣thecary,</HI> and that only because he lived in some mean, servile station for a time, with one of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appellation. These pretenders are above the ordinary business and attendance of a shop; that with then is quite out of the question; <HI>they fly at higher game</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>You may see some of these <HI>would-be doctors</HI> in all parts of the town in quest of prey. One dressed with all the formality of a prig, another affecting a dirty slovenly mien, and an unnatural, sullen grim∣mace, instead of the natural gravity which must necessarily possess men of understanding in the important practice of physic. The first shall assume a most pedantic, dogmatic air; the second, an ill∣feigned, awkward, <HI>hippocratic</HI> leer: and either shall smell, <HI>taste,</HI> or inspect excrements, examine the visage and tongue, and feel the pulse with great solemnity; then, in a long spun, uncouth jargon of ill-chosen, unintelligible, technical words, enough to raise the admiration and puzzle all the nurse-keepers in <HI>Christendom,</HI> shall ask a poor languishing patient, a set of tedious, impertinent, common-place ques∣tions, which he cannot possibly understand, and con∣sequently cannot answer. But the wily quack, with a self-sufficient look, and a weighty, revolving <HI>humh!</HI> — cries, <HI>so,</HI> — <HI>ay,</HI> — <HI>very well,</HI> — <HI>hemh,</HI> — <HI>I thought so,</HI> — <HI>I apprehend you,</HI> and so forth. Then armed with fatal pen, ink, and paper, he pre∣scribes largely, some stinking, mothered waters, fermented sirrups, pernicious burning spirits, in∣grateful, <HI>medicated brandy-juleps</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">G. Harvey.</NOTE>, or at best, <HI>unwhol∣some and unsavory punch,</HI> which the prescriber (to whom indeed their worth is solely known) calls <HI>specific</HI> or <HI>alexipharmic,</HI> and takes care often to repeat, because he would not have his patient <HI>die for want of a cordial,</HI> (as it is termed) or rather, that he may sell his wares and have an opportunity of charging for his visits; tho' he does not know, but he hereby in effect signs the poor <HI>sufferer's</HI> death-warrant, tho' he meant only to draw a <HI>small bill</HI> in his own favour. Yet ask this mighty <HI>sham-doctor,</HI> how the meanest compositions in his shop are made? whence this or the other simple ingredient? what
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>it's distinguishing marks and characteristics? or the like; I will venture to answer for him rather than betray his ignorance, he will confess <HI>he bought them from some hon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st druggist.</HI> No, no; he does not stoop to such mean things, <HI>he practises physic;</HI> like GARTH'S <HI>Colon,</HI></P>

<P>Let us now take a further view of such an apo∣thecary and see how he can teach pharmacy.</P>
<P>The apprentice of <HI>such a master,</HI> begins with a small smattering of grammar rules, and sometimes none; which he (least <HI>Tyro</HI> should soon discover his ignorance and illiterature, or in time out do him) judges sufficient. His fund of sense, genius, or o∣ther abilities, are never considered, being indeed but trifling to a <HI>modern Apothecary,</HI> for a little acquired craft may make a mere block-head, or even an <HI>I∣deot,</HI> pass for an <HI>Apothecary.</HI> His apprenticeship com∣mences, with the servile drudgery of the most abject slave; as for instruction of any kind he must not expect it, his master, who shines among his nurse-keepers and co-equals, had none: So that to learn his trade, the only prospect left, is to follow the good example of master, which in this instance is not at∣tended with much difficulty, and therefore requires but few documents. For altho' he deigns to suffer his vassal to make up some few physicians prescrip∣tions, (out of pure complaisance to the elder bro∣thers of the faculty of physic, or insuperable love of
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>pelf,) yet he never sullies his own delicate hands with any preparation; his fingers are made for no∣bler purposes, <HI>feeling of pulses,</HI> (in other words) <HI>pick∣ing of pockets.</HI> Nor does he think it needful he should, when from certain <HI>half bred</HI> or <HI>mungrel apo∣thecaries,</HI> falsely called <HI>druggists,</HI> he can buy almost every preparation or composition, or rather <HI>substitutes for any, cent per cent.</HI> cheaper than any honest man can make them; nothing need be wanting while there is any thing of the same or like appearance in the shop. The poor deluded boy is told, that master by experience knows this or the other base and foreign substitute to be equal, if not the same, with whatever he is pleased to vend it for. Thus is he to learn his future occupation!</P>
<P>At length the slavish apprenticeship ended, the mi∣serable, unedisied drudge of a vile quack is now be∣come a master. —Of what?—Why of a shop only forsooth.—See him already by example, if not by precept, thorough paced, not only in the little mean insinuating artifices and tricks of quacks and ordinary <HI>haberdashers of drugs;</HI> but likewise imbued with the base penury and sordid craft of pinching on the one hand the industrious wretch, who for want of better employment seeks a miserable livelihood, by gather∣ing the herbs or reptiles of the earth, and extorting on the other, an exorbitant profit from the pitiful farthing of the most necessitous. Having observed it needful while an apprentice, he chiefly studied the <HI>asiucia medica,</HI> the querks and artifices of <HI>physic-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obbers,</HI> rather than the necessary qualifications of a <HI>good apothecary,</HI> to which he is yet a stranger. He therefore apes something of the dress and mien of a physician, well knowing, <HI>that esteem is oftener gained by artifice and outward appearance, than by real worth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r merit;</HI> and then by fawning, cringing, dissimulati∣on, and the like, gains a set of acquaintance and customers in low life, by whom he is extolled, till, by degrees or accident, he rises a step higher, and so
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>is soon (like <HI>Moliere</HI>'s faggot-maker, tho' not al∣ways by stripes) <HI>persuaded to think himself a Doctor.</HI> His customers he now calls <HI>patients,</HI> in imitation of his superiors, and had he called them <HI>sufferers,</HI> the appel∣lation would be still more expressive and significant,</P>
<P>His sole care is now to vend the destructive maga∣zine of perishable shop-trumpery, which is not very difficult to effect, when the quack has pushed him∣self into some repute with the vulgar, among whom he must have many <HI>Jack-calls,</HI> by whom the skilful physicians and chirurgeons are artfully decried and falsely vilified, who might by abstinence, diet, air, or exercise, or by dexterity of hand or bandage, perhaps without the use of a shop-medicine, cure sundry maladies, for which the <HI>physic-shopkeeper</HI> bears them mortal enmity, as they do not promote his trade unnecessarily, with the usual fallacious insinua∣tion of <HI>his unparallelled skill and judgement in physic and chirurgery, and his thorough acquaintance with the prac∣tice of both, from the number of recipes, which come in∣to his hands:</HI> but above all, <HI>the cheapness of his advice and attendance;</HI> being said <HI>to charge no more than the bare prices of a few necessary, cheap Remedies;</HI> which is the principal recommendation. His character thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> established, he has frequent opportunities of putting off his commodities at any rate, and this he take care to improve by raising so many dangers and dif¦ficulties, that he keeps his poor <HI>sufferers</HI> in as wretche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a state of dread and dependence, as the wicked an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ignorant quack <HI>Coctier</HI> did the timorous king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>France</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lewis xi.

As a thrifty ale wife, to avoid excise, gave her customers ale <HI>gratis,</HI> paying two pence for the <HI>toast and nutmeg</HI> put into each quart.</P>
<P>Moreover to confirm the populace in their vain notions of their apothecary's judgement in physic, he has generally the artifice to become the basest <HI>pla∣giary.</HI> For among the customers, he uses on every occasion, or rather <HI>abuses,</HI> the prescriptions, and even borrows the very words of the family-physician. Thus he steals the doctor from himself! (if I may be allowed the phrase) insomuch, that when by force he is called in and consulted, it is ten to one the pre∣judiced patients will say, <HI>that the doctor said and di∣rected the very same things which the worthy apothe∣cary did before,</HI> in this or some other case, which they think, or perhaps are told, was the same.</P>
<P>I cannot here overlook that most abominable prac∣tice of <HI>some apothecaries</HI> and <HI>druggists,</HI> who not only personate one another, by assuming the name of their neighbouring brethren, in order to steal their customers, but a certain <HI>audacious quack</HI> has been known to personate <HI>a late physician</HI> of <HI>his name,</HI> and to recommend himself after as an <HI>apothecary.</HI> These base artifices lead them to make repetitions of prescriptions which they never saw, being on ano∣ther's file. How fatal such horrid guess-work must often prove, to the patient and proscriber, is easily
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>judged; and how late a gentleman of figure suffer∣ed by this sort of <HI>chicane,</HI> as well as his physician, I shall not say, lest it should too far injure a certain pert, young quack apothecary, whose rashness in this instance, will, I hope, prove a warning to him for the future.</P>
<P>Thus admirably equipped with craft and artifice, and with impudence and assurance, (the inseparable attendants of ignorance) this <HI>monstrous, amphibious animal, this wretched cebler in medicine,</HI> who has not in reality a single qualification for a <HI>physician</HI> or <HI>chirurgeon,</HI> nor perhaps even for an <HI>apothecary,</HI> vainly pretends to the knowledge of the <HI>three,</HI> and so takes upon him the sole care and management of the sick in all distempers and disorders; <HI>acute</HI> or <HI>chronic, physical</HI> or <HI>chirurgical</HI> cases are all alike to him, well knowing that <HI>his incapacity is not obvious to the unhappy parties concerned!</HI> he hardily persists in his malpractices, being blinded with <HI>ignorance,</HI> prompted by <HI>avarice,</HI> and having his conscience hardened by an early contracted <HI>habit of iniquity,</HI> till he has rendered the unhappy <HI>sufferers</HI> immedica∣ble; and then (seldom or never before) permits a physician or chirurgeon to be called in; or rather, if he can, brings in some <HI>poor pretender</HI> to, or <HI>mercena∣ry tool</HI> of, either profession, to justify his apparent misconduct, or to take the honor of giving the tor∣tured <HI>sufferer</HI> the <HI>Coup de Grace.</HI></P>
<P>I shall beg leave to give one melancholy instance of this kind our of many. A certain unfortunate man, who too much confided in the boasted skill of a bold presumptuous quack, committed himself to his care for a certain, slight, secret disorder: The apothecary judging it the only way to make a penny of the patient, proceeded to administer medicines <HI>by wholesale.</HI> For within the compass of three months he gave him above forty doses of mercurial physic, with sundry other costly drenches, which brought a considerable flux of humors upon the af∣fected part: to which he then made divers unctuous
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>applications, till at length it became cancerous. Lastly he had recourse to salivation, but with no better success, the patient grew sensibly worse: Yet the Quack to dispel the growing doubts and suspici∣ons of the poor abused man, called in a <HI>reputed phy∣sician,</HI> to justify his mal-practice, and assist him in the cure. The <HI>doctor</HI> being unable to satisfy the unhappy sufferer in his distrust of the <HI>quack,</HI> he call∣ed in better assistance, and had his life with great difficulty saved, by the amputation of the distem∣pered member. Notwithstanding all this gross abuse of the miserable patient, this unworthy apo∣thecary, who may be presumed to be the principal cause of the greatest evil attending this case, makes a most extravagant large bill, with a charge of <HI>twenty shillings</HI> to his coadjutor the doctor, annexed.</P>
<P>By these and such like unnatural transgres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons, is the <HI>apothecary</HI> led out of the way of his du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and bred an utter stranger to all parts of his proper calling. By this vile craft he gets his bread, no wonder then he should be firmly attached to it. This is all he learns, all he knows, all he practises, all he teaches: And this he finds sufficient to re∣commend him: He indeed generally takes care to secure an interest in some <HI>party</HI> or <HI>club,</HI> whether <HI>religious</HI> or <HI>politic,</HI> no matter with how little <HI>reason,</HI> provided he espouses and defends their principles with a good stock of <HI>blind zeal and violence,</HI> he is sure of the <HI>Society's</HI> favour, so he may securely neglect his <HI>true profession.</HI> He therefore employs his whole time in quacking or stroling over the town in quest of prey. For to avoid the dangerous imputation of having nothing to do, <HI>no practice,</HI> (as the phrase is,) he must never be found at home; not to be seen in his noisome shop except by accident to prescribe for some sudden emergency, or perhaps sometimes to edify by reading over his own <HI>ill-chosen, stolen re∣cipe's,</HI> there carefully filed more for <HI>shew</HI> than <HI>use:</HI> That done, he must hurry forth, and rush thro'
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>the streets as if he had so many calls, that he cannot tell which first to answer: While the principal part of his business, furnishing the shop and serving the <HI>wretched customers,</HI> is left to some mercenary <HI>sham∣druggist, a miserable herb-gatherer, and a raw appren∣tice.</HI> The very <HI>Druggist,</HI> who in all other nations in <HI>Europe</HI> is but <HI>Pharmacopela,</HI> a mere drug-mer∣chant, is with us, not only a <HI>physician and chirurgeon,</HI> but also <HI>a Galenic and Chemic apothecary; a seller of druggs, medicines, vernices, oils, paints or colours, poysons,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>a Jack of all trades,</HI> and in truth, <HI>ma∣ster of none</HI>—For bad as the usual education of an apothecary may be, if it could be yet worse, he may make a good modern druggist enough. And it is demonstrable, that, among the many who assume that name, there are not above two in <HI>Dub∣lin</HI> that have any right to it. These who are, if possible, worse quacks than the apothecaries, and generally worse qualified in every respect, were the first who introduced that blackest villainy of sophi∣sticating, and debasing of medicines to gain fame and applause by underselling their honest brethren; and you shall now find most of them ready to make up the prescriptions of physicians and chirurgeons, brought to them by the ignorant vulgar, (who alone indeed intrust them with such,) at any rate they are offered, even tho' they cannot read them, and tho' they may be composed of sundry medicaments to them utterly unknown. How must the unhappy patient and prescriber suffer, whose prescriptions fall into such unworthy hands?</P>
<P>Thus wretchedly is <HI>pharmacy</HI> taught and practised now a-days. How foreign to the manner of the <HI>antient, true apothecaries,</HI> is, I hope, evident from the foregoing; and how contradictory to reason, justice, and common sense, is, I believe, to every rational unprejudiced man, obvious. Yet, that under the pre∣sent fatal mismanagement, it is, and must continue so, is, I think, most demonstrable. For a man who
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>takes the greatest pains to learn that art, and acquires the most extraordinary knowledge, and all the requisite qualifications therein, and ever so strict∣ly, and diligently attends to the <HI>vegular calls</HI> of his profession, and discharges the <HI>duty,</HI> and <HI>proper office</HI> of an <HI>apothecary,</HI> if he does not most audaciously and adventurously, quack in all cases without dis∣tinction, he is surely deemed but a <HI>blockhead,</HI> and may remain to the generality unknown, and starve: or perhaps have the comfort of being reputed, in his narrow circle of acquaintance, <HI>a good, honest fellow, but no apothecary;</HI> that is to say, <HI>no quack;</HI> and is therefore despised, because, he has the candor and integrity, not to intermeddle with any business, but his own, nor to attempt things beyond his sphere. In short it is not such a man that is <HI>with us</HI> deemed an <HI>apothecary,</HI> no, it is the most despica∣ble of all human beings, a wretch ignorant of all arts, yet pretending to the greatest; a false, dis∣sembling sycophant, that poor, shallow mimick, or untowardly ape of a physician, chirurgeon and apo∣thecary, the vile, deluding quack! Where then is the encouragement to excel in this art, when the most ignorant of it, are, by the generality, preferred, and most esteemed?</P>
<P>I am well apprized that these will appear strange innovations to some of the brethren, as well as to those who have not only let the <HI>pretended apothe∣caries</HI> into the secrets of their families, but also In∣discreetly committed the care of their health and lives, into such unworthy hands, and suffered them∣selves to be blindly, and implicitly governed by them. Yet even those upon impartial examination, and serious consideration, will find them literally just and true. It requires no great depth of saga∣city to sound these ambitious pretenders, and to find how unfit and incapable they are, to practice the profession, whose name they undeservedly bear, and how much more that of physic and chirurgery.
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>How many are there among us so palpably ignorant, in a most material branch of their professed art, as to be daily imposed upon, not only by their drug∣gist, but even by the simple herb-gatherer, who both frequently impose upon them, one thing for another, tho' ever so different in their nature and properties? Is it not notorious, that <HI>thapsia</HI> or deadly carrot, for turpeth, gout-wort, or herb gerard, for master-wort, <HI>English</HI> black maidenhair, for the black and true maidenhairs, spurious germander, for ground-pine, burnet, for saxifrage, male fern, for osmond-royal, fig-wort, for solomon's seal, wall∣pepper or stone crop, for small houseleek, cypress for savin, stinking black horehound, for the white, bugle, for betony, and many such like pernicious impostures, are daily palmed upon the <HI>ignorant a∣pothecaries,</HI> notwithstanding the most apparent disparity in their outward appearance, as well as in their virtues and effects? And is not the common excuse of <HI>our apothecaries,</HI> upon the <HI>examiners</HI> con∣demning any drugg or medicine, in their shops, that they bought it at an high price from Mr. such an one, a druggist? Did not about sixty apothecaries and druggists, oppose the <HI>Bill for preventing Frauds and Abuses in Pharmacy,</HI> and jointly assert many gross absurdities and falshoods, and make many most frivolous equivocations, in their case offered to the House of Peers, in the year 1735? did they not therein call castor <HI>a cod,</HI> and cassia fruit <HI>a cane, like a sugar cane?</HI> and what less than the darkest ig∣norance, or the most consummate perversity, could thus prompt them to trifle with so august an as∣sembly? Did not two apothecaries of some emi∣nence, in the year 1739, advertise Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s <HI>medicines,</HI> for sale, long before the materials could possibly be had, or prepared? and did not these worthy brethren afterwards employ a certain, aban∣doned, infamous quack, (once well known <HI>to watch∣wen, and mid-night magistrates, to bailiffs, proctors,
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>church-wardens,</HI> &amp;c.) to vilify him, <HI>whom they only suspected,</HI> to have detected their abominable deceit? In charity, I hope, and am willing to believe, all this, and more, the effects of pure, confirmed igno∣rance; which, tho' equally pernicious with design, there is not at present the least prospect of re∣moving: For since it is not worth while to spend any time or pains, to learn a disregarded profession, by which so little profit is to be gained, as by <HI>true Pharmacy,</HI> (the bare name being enough <HI>to garnish the quack,</HI> nay, <HI>to dub him a doctor in his own, and the vulgar eyes,</HI>) it can hardly be otherwise expected, as the livelihood of most apothecaries, now a-days, depends upon their hawking about and quacking with such of their weak, unguarded neighbours, as suffer themselves to fall a prey to their perfidious craft and avarice.</P>
<P>It is most wonderful, and to those who are not thoroughly acquainted with the proper office and duty of an apothecary, inconceivable, what an ab∣ject state of depravity and degeneracy the apothe∣caries of this age are fallen into; and such in time must be the case of physic also, from the necessary mutual connection of each art, with the other: But moreover, it cannot be long worth any man's while to spend <HI>the best part of his life, and much of his fortune,</HI> in tedious, laborious studies, deep and accurate researches, into the most hidden, and re∣mote recesses of nature, when no distinction is made between him, and so base a pretender to physic, as an illiterate, unbred apothecary; more especially when it is in the power of such, to prevent his doing the good he seeks in his profession, to elude his best skill, and frustrate all his hopes and intentions of cure, by ignorance, dishonesty, or neglect, which must soon bring him, and the whole art, into the ut∣most contempt.</P>
<P>But it is yet more surprising, that these very men should so far have deceived the public, as to have
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>their pernicious quacking and tampering, with the health and lives of the people, still countenanced by many persons (in other respects) of good sense, and some of the best families. To see <HI>an hawking apothecary,</HI> that worst kind of <HI>mountebank,</HI> in dearth of trade, run strolling thro' the streets, gaping for prey, must, surely move the contempt and indigna∣tion of every considerate man, who knows <HI>how he should be employed.</HI> Yet pursue him but a little fur∣ther, you will find the cringing vagrant, a still greater object of your disdain. That learned phy∣sician, and ingenious humorist, Dr. <HI>Mandeville,</HI> gives the following true and lively portraits of one of these mercenary <HI>seekers.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treatise upon hypochondriac and hysteric passions, p. 216.</NOTE> <Q>"I have seen (says he) an apothecary in an idle afternoon, go to the house of a person of quality, who made use of him; there happened to be none at home, but children and servants, who from the highest to the lowest were in perfect health; if here he came for business, (you'll say) he was disappointed, but you are mistaken; the courteous gentleman, with an engaging familiarity, accosts every servant in the house, and puts off a purge to the cook, a vomit to the butler, a box of pills to one of the foot∣men, and a pot of <HI>Lucatellus</HI>'s balsam to old nurse. The children absolutely refusing to take any physic, at least inwardly, he coaxes little master into the use of a charming dentifrice, and a sweet-smelling collyrium, to rince his mouth with after it, that shall preserve his teeth, and make them look like ivory, tho' he should eat nothing but sugar and sweet-meats all the day long; to pretty miss, he'll send a lotion for her hair, and a (cosmetic) paste for her hands, that shall render one as bright as silver, and the other whiter than snow; with a beautifying wash to the maid, that assisted in persuading them.
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>The affable Gentleman has every body's good word; the children are pleased, the servants com∣mend him, my lady is obliged to him: and ten to one but the first opportunity of driving that way, her coach stops at his door, and she thanks him for the care he took of her family in her absence."</Q> — <HI>Admirable encouragement to vending the shop trampery at any rate, unnecessarily!</HI> Sure every rational, unprejudiced man, must judge this, and such like mean artifices of apothecaries, more culpable and more pernicious to the public, than the paltry harangues of a brawling <HI>mounte∣bank,</HI> to a rude rabble, as such only will hear him; whereas the former have recourse to all ranks and degrees of men.</P>
<P>How the more rational and better sort of people come to acquiesce under these heavy grievances, in the most tender point, and suffer the greatest impo∣sitions in matters of the last moment, without ever having even attempted a redress, is astonishing: But as it must now be owing to their not knowing the abuses and cheats, <HI>long custom having made them fa∣miliar,</HI> it is to be hoped, that, when the evil conse∣quences thereof are laid open, every good man will concur in taking some measures to prevent them for the future.</P>
<P>Sure there is nothing more inconsistent with common reason, than the taking apothecaries from their proper office and station! I never saw a patient that was not desirous the <HI>apothecary</HI> should <HI>himself</HI> prepare whatsoever medicines, should be prescribed for him; and if he is employed in <HI>quacking,</HI> and his time devoted to that alone, how is it possible he can see his customers justly served? But if none other evil had arose from the taking apothecaries from their occupation, and encouraging them to quack, and thereby to neglect their immediate office and duty, than subjecting the public to the grievous tax, of consuming as much of the apothecaries drugs, and at such a rate, as
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>they think proper, methinks that should have deterred men from it sufficiently. Should any of the most reputable and creditable artists, or trades∣men besides, be employed in furnishing a family with their goods, will any one say to such, <HI>come and see me, examine mine house, and send me as much of your commodities as you think requisite for me?</HI> I be∣lieve no man, in his senses, could be so weak: And yet, why should people repose more confidence in apothecaries, than in other tradesmen, in the like instances? they are but men, and altho' there may yet be among them <HI>some not unworthy of</HI> Sparta, <HI>in her primitive purity,</HI> yet this is too great a trust, to be reposed in mere mortals: For they have shops like other tradesmen, and these too furnished with <HI>perishable wares,</HI> which they must, therefore, vend the more expeditiously: Had they capacities for <HI>practising physic</HI> or <HI>chirurgery,</HI> they ordinarily have no gratuity allowed them for the supposed good they do, or for their trouble, but what they procure for themselves, by charging it on their medicines, which, with giving them in great, unnecessary abun∣dance, they assuredly take care of, being left en∣tirely their own carvers. And were they as well qualified for that weighty undertaking as <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> it is hardly to be expected that they should be such <HI>saints,</HI> as to refuse or neglect procuring payment or recompence for their extraordinary labours, or what they call their <HI>art,</HI> especially while it is left at <HI>their option;</HI> the ready way to effect which, is, by stuffing the unhappy sufferer with much nauseous, and (probably) unnecessary or improper medicines, even in such slight disorders, as nature, without their impertinent interruptions, could better throw off, by her unassisted powers. — <Q>"If a fish-monger, or poulterer, (says <HI>Mandeville,</HI>) should go to a customer's house after dinner, when the master and mistress were abroad, advise the servants, one to a fine salmon, the other to a dozen of turkey
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>pouts, and send them home accordingly, would you not think them very impudent rascals?"</Q> <HI>Most certainly:</HI> And yet the officious quack apothe∣cary is equally guilty with either, both having put off their wares, where they knew they were not at all wanting or necessary, with this aggravation, that the former gave some things useful, and of known value, but the latter things entirely useless, at best, of small intrinsic worth; to the taker, of none, unless by accident, and perhaps very dangerous and hurtful.</P>
<P>The cause of the groundless notions usually en∣tertained, <HI>of the skill and judgement of apothecaries, in physic and chirurgery, and the cheapness of their advice,</HI> is a vain, vulgar prejudice, industriously pro∣pagated by artful quacks, and their servile tools and emissaries. From the apothecaries, seeing the practice of physicians and chirurgeons, in sundry distempers and disorders, with the great numbers of the prescriptions of both, which necessarily come into their hands, it is insinuated and imagined, <HI>that they must understand the whole art of healing in all it's parts, as well as those who have made it their sole study and practice, for many years:</HI> And this is the reason, why apothecaries are usually first called to the sick, by which means, they are in fact rendered the <HI>jack-calls</HI> of physicians and chirurgeons; in as much as it is manifest, that they often make work for both, by multiplying patients, and rendering many cases worse, and more inveterate, than when they were first consulted, if the unhappy <HI>sufferers</HI> have the good fortune to outlive their expensive, injudicious tamperings for any time.</P>
<P>It may now perhaps be advanced as heretofore, upon another occasion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Observ. on the physician's Bill, 1725.</NOTE>, and it must be allowed, <HI>that a thorough bred, experienced apothecary, who knows the faces, qualities, and vertues, of simple and
<PB N="42" REF="42"/>compound medicines,</HI> (to which I must add, who un∣derstands anatomy, and the animal oeconomy, and knows the histories, causes, and diagnostics of dis∣tempers, without which, he can never be capable of making just observations on the effects of remedies, or curing diseases,) <HI>may be as safely confided in, as the graduate of any university:</HI> And the same may be said of an old nurse-keeper.—It is certain, a gang of <HI>lawless thieves and vagabonds,</HI> founded the greatest common-wealth in the world, and promulged the wisest human laws for the punishment and sup∣pression of vice, and the encouragement of virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertot's Rom. Revol.</NOTE>. But sure we are not to expect the like from every set of <HI>Benditti?</HI> Nor suffer any evil to be done, that good may accrue? Why then should the present race of apothecaries, who neither have, nor can pre∣tend to the requisite qualifications of physicians, or chirurgeons, be allowed to sport with the health, lives, and fortunes of the public, at their discretion? When it is evident, they should not be trusted with the care of the sick, in any disorder, nor even in their own profession, till they have first given open proofs of their understanding it. Nothing should induce you to give any men such an unreasonable, and unjust toleration. Our happy constitution is such, that no man, or body of men, can make a monopoly of any art, science, or trade: for a meri∣torious person, amesnable to the laws, may be ad∣mitted to profess, or practise any occupation what∣soever. If any man is conscious of his knowledge, or capacity in medicine, he may present himself to the college of physicians, and sue for a licence to practise, which, having answered the proper exami∣tions, they are obliged to grant, they cannot refuse: So that an apothecary, or any other person, found duly qualified, may obtain a licence, to practise physic: But we find none of our apothecaries have, in any
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>instance, legally qualified themselves for such a weighty undertaking, most contenting themselves with no better a <HI>Diploma</HI> than <HI>a shop, garnished with sundry empty, painted, and labelled vessels,</HI> with it's windows <HI>adorned with monstrous, or strange, useless animals,</HI> as <HI>tortoises, toads,</HI> &amp;c. how then are they to be trusted in matters of such importance? Are they not rather to be industriously avoided, and justly despised?</P>
<P>To attain to a competent knowlege in <HI>pharmacy,</HI> and afterwards to discharge the <HI>office,</HI> justly and faithfully, must require more time than <HI>apothecaries</HI> can properly spare, who attempt arts, for which they have laid no sort of foundation: And as none of them, have performed any of the requisites for <HI>a physician,</HI> or <HI>chirurgeon,</HI> and few, or none, even those for an <HI>apothecary,</HI> I think it as arrogant, and as impudent in <HI>an apothecary,</HI> to presume, to prac∣tise <HI>physic</HI> or <HI>chirurgery,</HI> or to pretend to any skill or judgement in either, as it would be in the most illiterate <HI>printer or bookseller,</HI> to pretend to the <HI>Ma∣thematics,</HI> or any other branch of <HI>Philosophy</HI> or <HI>Li∣terature,</HI> merely because he printed sundry learned books, in these sciences, for sale; or, for <HI>a color∣grinder,</HI> (to use <HI>Mandeville</HI>'s words,) to <HI>painting,</HI> only because he grinds the several colors, and per∣haps prepares the pallate and pencils for his master, and sees him frequently paint. The <HI>apothecary,</HI> it is true, may frequently see patients in all manner of distempers and disorders, hear and see the most judici∣ous <HI>physicians</HI> and <HI>chirurgeons,</HI> accurately examine their various complaints, may peruse their several pre∣scriptions, nay prepare and administer them. The <HI>printer</HI> likewise may see the best manuscripts of the most celebrated authors in all branches of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> may print and reprint them, and have thousands of impressions to dispose of: And the <HI>color-grinder</HI> also, may daily see his <HI>master</HI> execute his best skill and most sublime designs in <HI>drawing,</HI> and may (by
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>his directions) make up and lay out in due order up∣on the pallate, the several proper colors, and also provide the several necessary pencils and tools for <HI>painting</HI> the same. And yet, notwithstanding, each must probably remain in the darkest ignorance, and continue utter strangers to <HI>physic, philosophy,</HI> and <HI>painting,</HI> until regularly initiated into the <HI>rudiments,</HI> and duly and methodically instructed in the <HI>several rules</HI> of the respective arts; and all that such may be said to know in them, are a few technical words, learned by rote or accident, which can serve only to impose upon the ignorant. These <HI>impostors,</HI> it is certain, may shine among their kind, and even de∣ceive men of sense and learning in other matters for a while, but they can never stand the test of proper judges. Happy indeed, were it for the public, had the <HI>pretenders</HI> to these three arts, been equally con∣spicuous to the world. If so, it is more than pro∣bable, there would be more <HI>botches</HI> observed in the practice of the pretenders to physic and chirurgery, (to say nothing of downright <HI>murders,</HI> which are usually hid by the friendly grave-digger) than there are to be seen in the <HI>nocturnal works</HI> of the printers of <HI>last speeches</HI> and ballads, or in the vile, insignifi∣cant daubings of the <HI>pretenders</HI> to painting on the paltry signs in all the streets in town.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>cheapness of the advice of apothecaries</HI> in <HI>physic or chirurgery,</HI> it is a most false and deceitful insinuation. It's value will best appear by con∣sidering their qualification. If it appears they have none, as I think it must, what is their advice worth? Should it not be avoided as a pest? I know it is objected by some, and made a handle by quacks, <HI>that the fees of physicians and chirurgeons are too high,</HI> and <HI>that people in low life, cannot purchase their atten∣dance or advice.</HI> I have in some measure answered these objections already,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 31.</NOTE> I shall endeavour to obviate them further. It is true, there is no nation in the world
<PB N="45" REF="45"/>at this time, that so justly prizes the merits of physi∣cians and chirurgeons, or so nobly rewards both, as <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> For from our natural freedom, no restraint has been laid on rewarding just deserts in any instance. Yet notwithstanding, there are no people in <HI>Europe,</HI> even where fees are lowest, that may be better attended than those of these Kingdoms, did not officious, selfish quacks inter∣fere.</P>
<P>There is no set of men, who deserve better of the public, than physicians and chirurgeons; none have been and are more publicly and privately beneficent. The extraordinary munificence of Dr. <HI>Radcliffe,</HI> and Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> of our Sir <HI>Patrick Dun,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Stevens;</HI> with many others, are mo∣numents which must attest this truth to futurity. And I can affirm on the other hand, that I never met with an object so despicable, that could not com∣mand the advice and attendance of numbers of phy∣sicians, and chirurgeons of the first rank, upon its own terms: And that I have often known physici∣ans to refuse fees from tradesmen of good circum∣stances, and yet attend them constantly for many days after, without any other obligation that that of humanity. Is not this much better than to be sub∣ject to pay rigorously the smaller fees, and to have the bodies liable to be detained, dead or alive, for payment; as we hear it is in some neighbouring na∣tions? Our poor have no reason to complain in this instance, of any thing mere than the oppression of quacks. The houses of our physicians and chirur∣geons are open to, and they are as ready to succour, the poor sick as the opulent. Are not our <HI>Infirmary</HI> and <HI>Hospitals</HI> attended <HI>gratis?</HI>— It were well for apothecaries, as well as chirurgeons in low life, that none but real objects could partake of these Chari∣ties.—</P>
<PB N="46" REF="46"/>
<P N="3">III. I now come to my third head, namely, to lay open some of the most considerable frauds and abuses of apothecaries and druggists, and to point out some of the most pernicious <HI>sophistications</HI> of <HI>me∣dicines,</HI> with the evil consequences thereof.</P>
<P>It is commonly said, <HI>that physicians and apothecaries kill more than they cure.</HI>—However ludicrous or satyri∣cal this phrase may sound, it is a melancholy con∣sideration, that the ill-natured sarcasm often proves just, and is likely to continue so, until the <HI>apotheca∣ries and druggists,</HI> are brought under some proper regulations, which may restrain them from <HI>hawking</HI> and <HI>quacking,</HI> and confine them within the just limits of their <HI>respective callings.</HI> For into such an abyss of depravity and degeneracy, are these men fallen, by their grasping at matters beyond their sphere; that now (thro' ignorance or dishonesty) there is scarce a medicine of any worth to be had genuine; the knowledge of many of the most valuable simples is utterly lost, and in their room, some vile and fo∣reign counterfeit, as quacks for apothecaries, foisted upon the unwary Public. <HI>For corruption by long impunity hardens the offenders, multiplies the number of the guilty, and is now so far from being deemed scanda∣lous</HI> in this way, <HI>that it is really become fashion∣able.</HI></P>
<P>Before I proceed to wilful errors, it may not be impertinent, first, to expose some arising from the ignorance and illiterature of apothecaries, being probably the principal causes of many more, and which may produce as evil consequences as any o∣thers.</P>
<P>The works of the most authentic medical writers, are in <HI>Arabic, Greek,</HI> or <HI>Latin.</HI> The best known names of distempers, as well as of medicines, the <HI>ex∣otic druggs</HI> especially, are in these or some other <HI>fo∣reign Languages,</HI> often <HI>compound;</HI> and most of the technical words in medicine, are also <HI>compound,</HI> tho' mostly of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> We do not as yet
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>know an <HI>English name</HI> for one vegetable in twenty. For as physic took it's origin in the eastern parts of the world, and is not as yet truly naturalized to our tongue and idiom; it has hitherto been found so un∣certain and difficult, to reduce the <HI>terms of art,</HI> and <HI>names of medicaments,</HI> into any other tongue than the <HI>Latin,</HI> properly and expressively, that all the colleges of physicians in <HI>Europe,</HI> have not only been obliged to give their dispensatories in <HI>Latin,</HI> but in many to admit an entire <HI>Greek</HI> word or phrase, as being least ambiguous, most expressive and signifi∣cant. And this is the principal Reason for writing, extemporaneous prescriptions also in <HI>Latin.</HI> This made it necessary for <HI>apothecaries</HI> to understand the learned languages; and they were in all ages sensi∣ble of it; until of late, some <HI>hirelings</HI> sprang up, who, finding what a propensity people had to <HI>quack∣cry;</HI> judged they might scribble that way for the vulgar, to gain a livelihood, and so presumed to translate the works of the learned in physic, into the vulgar tongue; which <HI>false, pretended trannslations,</HI> being seldom or never read by any that understand the originals, have passed with their manifold errors unobserved to this Day. Among these erroneous, hackney translators, the most celebrated among the apothecaries at present, I may say the most in fashi∣on, is the late famous Dr. <HI>Quincy,</HI> a <HI>Quondam apo∣thecary</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> Who it is said <HI>wrote for bread in a Jail.</HI> What right he might have had to annex <HI>M. D.</HI> to his name, I have not yet been able to learn with any certainty; unless he followed the good ex∣ample of his worthy predecessor <HI>Salmon,</HI> who, being called to account for putting these letters after his name, upon the specious title pages of his many volumes of fulsome falshood and nonsense, it is said, <HI>declared he did not mean them for Medicinae Doc∣tor, but for Medicamentorum Donator.</HI> In which sense Mr. <HI>Quincy,</HI> and every other <HI>apothecary,</HI> has, no doubt, without leave of an University, a right to use them.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="48"/>
<P>The ignorance of the present set of apothecaries, and their unacquaintance with the learned languages, puts them under a necessity, instead of observing the original <HI>London</HI> Dispensatory, and preparing and dis∣pensing their medicines thereby, as the KING'S <HI>Proclamation prefixed to it enjoins,</HI> to use a spurious translation of that Dispensatory by the aforesaid <HI>Quincy;</HI> in which he has committed the most gross and dangerous mistakes. For instance, in the Sirup of Marsh-mallows, a composition of softening, cooling, pectoral, and diuretic Herbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He ren∣ders <HI>Adiantum album &amp; nigrum</HI> (capillary herbs, called black and white Maiden-hairs) <HI>black and white Hel∣lebores,</HI> an harsh, drastic, purgative root, and an acrid and almost caustic and vomitive one, in the room of mild, safe, balsamic Plants, so plainly repugnant to the intended virtues of that medicine! He has rendered <HI>sesquiunciam,</HI> one ounce and an half, <HI>half an ounce,</HI> even in a composition, wherein there are above six pounds sterling difference in the <HI>expence</HI> of that medicine, when dispensed by the Dispensatory, and the same done by his translation; besides the <HI>virtue</HI> of the remedy's being abated in proportion to what is omitted of the principal ingredient. The same author leaves out several things prescribed by the College Dispensatory, in many compositions, o∣mits directing the several parts of simples thereby directed to be used, and in short, commits many unpardonable errors and omissions too tedious to enu∣merate, which are swallowed implicitly by the ig∣norant and illiterate, to the unspeakable detriment of the public. In another of his <HI>pharmaceutic works,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His Praelectiones pharmac. by Dr. <HI>Shaw,</HI> Lect. ix.</NOTE> he teaches the apothecary how <HI>to substitute,</HI> and gives even a list of such things as he justifies the sub∣stitution of for others. Among these he says, that <HI>balsam capivi</HI> may be given for <HI>balm of gilead; styrax,</HI> for <HI>balm of tolu; saffron</HI> for <HI>bezoar; bole</HI> for <HI>dragon's
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>blood,</HI> for <HI>carthamus seed mustard seed,</HI> and other such like shocking incoherencies. Yet all these, however dangerous and destructive to society they may prove, are in some sort excusable in these who could have known no better; at least they are more pardonable than the many wilful frauds and corruptions, which the <HI>apothecaries</HI> and <HI>druggists,</HI> have been so long ac∣customed to, that like a liar who has told his false tale so often over, that he at length brings himself to believe it truth) they have so far hardened their consciences, as to judge the most vile and pernicious counterfeits, not only justifiable, but as good as the true and genuine medicines; and so have generously reduced the prices of many compositions, by half less than any honest man can sell them. By which means, several have become such absolute strangers to the very faces of medicines, that they have been known to reject the genuine, when offered to sale, and prefer the most base <HI>substitutes</HI> or <HI>adulterations.</HI></P>
<P>The unparalleled, naked <HI>villainy</HI> of the <HI>English druggists,</HI> which ours, as far as they can, imitate, is the principal cause of the many abominable <HI>sophisti∣cations</HI> of medicines. I am well informed, that these avaricious falsifiers, who are well versed in robbing their KING and COUNTRY, were so au∣dacious and so impudent, as to declare, in a Body before the <HI>British Parliament;</HI> in answer to the pre∣amble of a bill, passed in the reign of KING GEORGE the first, of GLORIOUS MEMORY, <Q>"That they did not vend any unsound, or adulterate drugs or me∣dicines, to the prejudice of his Majesty's good subjects of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> but that all such they sent to IRELAND"</Q>—And they thought, no doubt, their useless scraps and offals, too good for us; because we find by woeful experience, that the latter part of their wicked assertion, they daily veri∣fy. For tho' the <HI>British</HI> privy council did this unhappy island the justice, to retort this answer up∣on the same worthy set of men, when, by the in∣stigation
<PB N="50" REF="50"/>of their <HI>Irish</HI> correspondents, they opposed the bill, passed here, in the year 1735, and so, una∣nimously recommended it to the Royal Assent; yet no means has hitherto been found, to prevent this being the common sink of all the corrupt, or decay∣ed drugs of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The abuse of the <HI>draw-back,</HI> given to encourage trade and exportation in <HI>England,</HI> proves now a ma∣nifest injury to the KING'S <HI>Revenues,</HI> and an insupe∣rable impediment to following our trade here honestly; which must necessarily be destructive of the health and lives of the people of this kingdom. For the dread of discovery, and due punishment, upon exposing bad drugs to sale in <HI>London,</HI> together, with the advantages arising by the <HI>draw-back</HI> upon sending them to <HI>Ireland,</HI> tho' they were quite rotten and useless, will always be a motive to infest us with the refuse of all their sortments, the very <HI>cul∣lings</HI> of their drugs, nay, the mere <HI>sweepings</HI> of their drug-ware-houses. For when a <HI>Londoner</HI> imports a drug, and pays the duty, he removes it to a ware∣house, and sorts it, and what proves so unsound or decayed, that he cannot with impunity, or credit, sell there, he transports to <HI>Ireland,</HI> swearing it to be within the limited time, and consigning it to a proper correspondent. It arrives here, the corres∣pondent receives it, pays the duty, which (if not taxed in our Book of Rates, wherein most drugs are much lower rated than in <HI>England</HI>) it is valued upon oath, by the <HI>Londoner</HI>'s directions, perhaps, not as many pence as it was first valued shillings; the duty is accordingly paid, and a certificate thereof returned to the <HI>London</HI> transporter, who is thereby intitled to draw-back the duty paid at first importation, for so much as was entered in <HI>Ireland;</HI> except a small mat∣ter not exceeding two and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> or there∣abouts. So that <HI>Rubarb,</HI> whose duty upon impor∣tation in <HI>England,</HI> is six shillings and ten pence the pound, <HI>draws back</HI> upon exportation about six shillings
<PB N="51" REF="51"/>and four pence, and most other drugs in like propor∣tion. For this cause, the most vile drugs, which can escape the <HI>examiners</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> are sent hither; the saving the <HI>draw-back,</HI> if they got no more for them here, (where, by the by, a customer is never wanting for such) being a sufficient incouragement. This is so notorious a practice, that our importers often openly confess it, and the <HI>English</HI> merchants are so expert at this trade, that they send their cor∣respondents invoyces, with the <HI>draw-back</HI> calculated and deducted from their accounts. I have known a∣bout twenty pounds of damaged Rubarb sent by a merchant in <HI>London,</HI> to an apothecary in <HI>Dublin,</HI> up∣on commission, with directions to sell it expeditious∣ly, for whatever he could. And altho' there was not a single ounce sound or fit for use in the cargo, yet a certain great <HI>druggist</HI> bought it, at about a fourth of the then current price of good Rubarb, and dyed it to impose upon his customers.</P>
<P>Familiar instances of these abuses, almost every entry of drugs, and I believe of many other mer∣chandizes affords. I shall mention but a remarkable one made by a late celebrated druggist, about the year 1728. He imported eight hundred weight of Jesuits Bark, entered it at the custom-house, valued upon oath, at a groat per pound. The land-officer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Craven.</HI></NOTE> surprised at this strange undervaluation, not know∣ing the quality of the drug; before he would make a seizure, (which, if undervalued, he had a right to) advised with that faithful, eminent chemist, the ingenious Mr. <HI>Maple,</HI> who, upon examining it, assu∣red him, that it was not worth one penny a pound, having not a single characteristic of the drugg it was entered for, by which it might be even known.— This instance shews the cause, in confirmation of the observations of some learned physicians,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Harris Pharm. Anti-Empir. p. 190.</NOTE> why one
<PB N="52" REF="52"/>drachm or two of <HI>Peruvian Bark</HI> succeeded better for∣merly, than some ounces now a days.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>is the</HI> KING <HI>most ungenerously robbed of his just revenues,</HI> and thus <HI>are the health and lives of his sub∣jects endangered,</HI> or <HI>destroyed,</HI> by the iniquitous con∣federacy of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Irish Druggists,</HI> particu∣larly in their gross abuse of that great encourage∣ment to trade, <HI>a draw-back.</HI> And as such vile per∣nicious stuff as this is daily imported and sold by mercenary men among us, who have nothing to re∣commend them but their underselling every fair dealer, it is plain a <HI>faithful apothecary,</HI> who chuses the best commodities at any rate, for the good of his customers, and his own <HI>private satisfastion,</HI> must appear a most extravagant extortioner to all such as cannot distinguish the qualities of Medicines, and consequently, <HI>he cannot expect a livelihood by his pro∣fession, if he persists in candor and integrity!</HI></P>
<P>Besides the many impositions we are liable to in this way from abroad, there are many of our own manufacture equally pernicious to the public, of which give me leave to instance but a sew.</P>
<P>When Gum <HI>Ammoniac</HI> in the crude, impure mass is sold at about ten shillings the pound, yet is the <HI>plaster</HI> (made by dissolving it in <HI>vinegar</HI> of <HI>squills</HI> and <HI>juice</HI> of <HI>hemlock,</HI> straining and boiling it to a proper consistence, in which it loses very considerably of it's weight, besides the trouble and expence that neces∣sarily attends the operation) so debased, as to be sold for less than a fourth of the price of the <HI>Gum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Calbanum</HI> has suffered the same fate. It is a sub∣stance of much the like texture with the former, and must be strained or otherwise depurated, to render it fit for use, by which it suffers much the same loss with the <HI>Ammoniac:</HI> Yet notwithstanding, so long have people been accustomed to <HI>fraud</HI> in this medi∣cine, and so familiar is the <HI>substitute</HI> now become, that the generous, genuine <HI>Gum</HI> is utterly rejected by the good-women and others; and so hardened are
<PB N="53" REF="53"/>the very <HI>falsifiers</HI> grown in this wicked practice, that the <HI>pretended Druggists</HI> in effect confess it; For I have it under the hand of one of them in a Bill of Rates, <HI>that he sells the strained for little more than one third of the price of the crude Galbanum.</HI></P>
<P>So base is the counterfeit sold for <HI>Balsam Capivi,</HI> which is a natural <HI>tear</HI> or <HI>juice</HI> issuing upon incision of a certain tree in <HI>America,</HI> that it is openly sold with us for less than the <HI>King's</HI> duty upon importation of that drug.</P>
<P>When such barefaced villainy is committed in the simple drugs, what may we not expect in the com∣pound Medicines? Since the more compound or mixed a remedy is, the better opportunity there must be for cheating, by substituting the basest for the best, or leaving out the dearest and principal in∣gredient in the composition, in order to deceive the customers, and undersell the honest compounder.</P>
<P>To point out all the abuses in this way, must <HI>(alas!)</HI> be no less than a comment upon the dispen∣satory, which would be too tedious and prolix, and by reason of the difficulty of comprehending the nature or effects of <HI>frauds</HI> in <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> without some knowledge in <HI>Physic,</HI> as well as a good under∣standing in that art, I have chose to mention but ome of the most obvious.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jallap</HI> Root is sold for six or seven shillings the pound, yet is the <HI>Resin,</HI> extracted at great ex∣pence and labour, tho' sixteen ounces of one, will not afford two ounces of the other, so vilely sophisti∣cated, as to be sold by our Druggists for two shillings an ounce.</P>
<P>The more compound and expensive a Medicine is, the more art and industry is used to <HI>sophisticate</HI> or <HI>debase</HI> it. Thus the <HI>Treacle of Andromachus,</HI> which takes it's name from the physician of <HI>Nero</HI> the <HI>tyrant,</HI> who invented it, and the <HI>Mithridate,</HI> which takes it's name also from it's royal author <HI>Mithridates</HI> king of <HI>Pontus,</HI> both which have been received into all the
<PB N="54" REF="54"/>Dispensatories, and ever since deemed the <HI>Capital Medicines</HI> in all the shops in <HI>Europe;</HI> and of which the wise States of <HI>Venice</HI> have taken such special care in the composition, that they are not to be dis∣pensed in the republic but under the inspection of Magistrates appointed for that purpose, whence the former got the common appellation of <HI>Venice-Treacle,</HI> because for a long time none was reckoned good that was not made there; altho' it is most certain, that it may, and has been, as justly and faithfully dis∣pensed and prepared here as there, or in any other place whatsoever: These noble Medicines, which for such a tract of time have stood the test, and were ever held in the highest esteem, are now fallen into such disrepute and contempt, through the fre∣quent <HI>debasings</HI> and <HI>adulterations</HI> they have under∣gone, that it is rare to find either ever prescribed for internal use by physicians.</P>
<P>The temptations to <HI>dishonesty</HI> are certainly greater in our trade than in any other whatsoever, from the prodigious gains and assured secrecy that attend our worst <HI>Deceits.</HI> Most are capable of distinguishing frauds in the ordinary necessaries of life; but as some <HI>branch</HI> of <HI>medicine</HI> alone can apprehend those in <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> so the apothecaries <HI>transgress</HI> undis∣covered, or even unsuspected, openly, easily, and securely. Few Medicines have suffered more by the hands of dishonest operators, than those (once) justly famed compositions, just now mentioned; the one of which consists of above seventy, the other of about fifty ingredients, mostly very rare, the pro∣ducts of the most remote parts of the World, and consequently difficult to be had sound and genuine; yet are both so wretchedly debased by mercenary artificers, that they are daily openly sold for less than half the first cost of the true composition: Nay, the very inscription and seal, clapt upon the <HI>Treacle</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> by the inspecting magistrates, is now artfully counterfeited in <HI>London,</HI> and put upon
<PB N="55" REF="55"/>pots or canisters of their own vile manufacture to deceive the ignorant and unwary; and this kind you may sometimes see hawked here as well as in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> by a pretended <HI>Venetian</HI> sailor, who perhaps never crossed the seas.</P>
<P>It is well known to every physician and good apothecary, that <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Hart's-horn</HI> (properly speak∣ing) consists of nothing more than the volatile Salt, dissolved in the radical Humidity, and blended with a small portion of the native exalted oil of that Animal, extracted from his horns by fire, according to art; and it's celebrated uses and virtues are too well known to require any panegyric. Yet this most ad∣mirable Medicine is now so basely <HI>counterfeited,</HI> that the few who have it genuine cannot pretend to sell it without loss; being undersold by all the avaricious falsifiers of medicines, who make what they un∣justly give that name to, and impose upon the pub∣lic in it's room, of no better materials than <HI>stale piss, brine, soot,</HI> and <HI>roche-lime.</HI> And nevertheless this <HI>adulteration</HI> has so far gained ground and prevailed, that nothing but the pungent, quick-smelling <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>piss</HI> will go down with the generality, being so long accustomed to this vile, <HI>excrementitious distill∣ment,</HI> which strikes the senses so much more quick and piquant, that they pronounce the other dead or vapid.</P>
<P>Spirit of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> is directed to be made with Salt of Tartar; but because lime is cheaper, and affords more spirit, it is mostly used for it, tho' the spirits raised by both are extremely different.</P>
<P>How unequal the effects of true <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>hart's-horn</HI> and that of <HI>piss,</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> with <HI>salt</HI> of <HI>Tartar</HI> and that with <HI>lime,</HI> may be upon the human body, I must leave to the learned in, physic to determine; but this I can say from actual obser∣vation, that true <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>Hart's-horn</HI> and that of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> with <HI>salt</HI> of <HI>Tartar,</HI> are, in their own natures, truly alkaline, and produce a considerable
<PB N="56" REF="56"/>contrast, or ebullition, upon mixture with acids: <HI>Those</HI> with <HI>lime,</HI> the contrary—whence I think it reasonable to judge their respective virtues and me∣thods of acting extremely opposite.</P>
<P>I could lay mine hand upon a certain venerable, antique Gentleman, who occasionally personates a Physician or Chirurgeon, an Apothecary, Chemist or Druggist, and GARTH <HI>'s Colon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dispensary, <HI>Cant.</HI> ii.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>In morals loose, but most precise in look.</P>
<P>Who takes a shorter and easier method of counter∣feiting these <HI>spirits,</HI> tho' equally foreign to the true, and, perhaps, equally pernicious with the former <HI>sophistications.</HI> He takes <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> one part, <HI>Pot-ashes</HI> two parts, and common water a sufficient quantity to dissolve the whole: when dissolved, he strains, and puts one part in a glass, falsely labelled, for <HI>spirit,</HI> of <HI>Sal Ammoniac,</HI> and the other, tinged yellow, in one, more unjustly titled, for <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>Hart's-horn;</HI> and sells both at a most exorbitant price, under the respective false denominations afore∣said, by the iniquitous use of the name of a certain considerable Chemist before-mentioned, on whom he fathers many other spurious compositions.</P>
<P>Unassisted reason, without any great knowledge in <HI>Physic</HI> or <HI>Chemy,</HI> may shew what a contrary effect these <HI>cheats</HI> must produce, from the genuine medi∣cines; and it is not difficult to conceive how both Patient and Prescriber must suffer by the use of this <HI>horrid imposture:</HI> For it is evidently but a mere so∣lution of these crude salts, and consequently loaden with the caustic <HI>Pot-ashes,</HI> as well as the <HI>marine salt</HI> in the <HI>Sal Ammoniac;</HI> both which compose a <HI>third kind,</HI> very repugnant to the properties of either <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> or <HI>Hart's-horn,</HI> and which is so fixed as not to be raised by any degree of fire; whereas
<PB N="57" REF="57"/>what is truly <HI>volatile</HI> alone, (which only can answer the intentions of those who prescribe either <HI>spirits</HI>) is elevated by the gentlest heat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tincture</HI> of <HI>Castor,</HI> another admirable remedy, is likewise basely <HI>sophisticated.</HI> It is ordered by the learned Authors of the Dispensatory we are to follow, to be extracted with spirit of <HI>French</HI> wine rectified, first distilled from <HI>Castor, Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmegs, Lavender Flowers,</HI> and some other <HI>aromatic, nervous</HI> medicines, and this is called <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>Castor;</HI> which must undoubtedly render the <HI>tincture</HI> more powerful and effectual for the purposes designed. Yet, not∣withstanding, quite regardless of it's virtues or effects, you will find the apothecaries great strangers to this medicine. I have heard one of the most eminent among them, a man of great reputed honesty and understanding say, in the presence of some consider∣able Members of the College of Physicians, that this spirit is good for nothing, and that brandy ex∣tracted as good a <HI>tincture</HI> from the <HI>Castor.</HI> It must indeed be confessed, that <HI>brandy,</HI> or the <HI>common, foe∣tid, foul, Malt</HI> or <HI>Molossus spirits,</HI> which are most frequently used upon this and the like occasions, in∣stead of spirit of wine, will acquire as deep a color from Castor and such like substances, as the <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>Castor,</HI> or any other spirit, of equal strength with them, can do; and that may perhaps suffice such as only aim at the basest rate to <HI>counterfeit</HI> the external form or appearance of a medicine, to answer their own mercenary ends alone. And we know <HI>deceptions</HI> are attempted in this kind, where the very similitude is wanting: For this same <HI>false, reddish tincture</HI> has been sold for the <HI>spirit,</HI> which is pure and limpid.</P>
<P>I would ask any candid man, conversant in Phar∣macy, a few Questions, which he cannot, without concern, answer. Is it not known, That <HI>common Copperose,</HI> a <HI>nauseous</HI> and <HI>unwholesome drug,</HI> is sold for <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Steel,</HI> an agreeable, safe, and efficacious me∣dicine, and even at a rate but little less than that of
<PB N="58" REF="58"/>the genuine, the better to cover the deceit? That <HI>New-England Castor,</HI> tho' vastly inferior in virtues, and of a very different make and appearance from the <HI>Russian,</HI> which we are always ordered to use, is taken and sold for that, only because a pound of the former seldom exceeds in value one ounce of the latter? That <HI>pot</HI> or <HI>gravelled Ashes,</HI> of about a groat the pound, is sold for the <HI>fixt Salts</HI> of <HI>Tartar,</HI> of <HI>Wormwood,</HI> and other <HI>vegetalles,</HI> which are not to be made without great trouble and expence; and not∣withstanding the extraordinary difference that appears between them upon experiment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hoffman. Obser. Phys. Chym. p. 219. Boerhaav. Elem. chem. Tom. ii. p. 34.</NOTE>? That <HI>Suet,</HI> or some animal fat, but slightly impregnated with Mace, is sold for the <HI>expressed Oil</HI> of <HI>Mace,</HI> at less than the very <HI>spice</HI> can be sold for? That common <HI>Barbadoes Aloes,</HI> of about twenty pence a pound, is used in many compositions, and sold for the <HI>Succotrine Aloes,</HI> worth about eight shillings the pound? That <HI>Saffron</HI> is omitted in many medicines wherein it is ordered, or <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>bastard Saffron</HI> used instead of <HI>British,</HI> notwithstanding the greatest disparity in their virtues and prices? That <HI>Molossus,</HI> or <HI>common Treacle,</HI> is used in several electuaries, and other medicines, in∣stead of the <HI>Sirups</HI> directed? That common, <HI>white Bryony</HI> Root, bought at about two pence the pound, is mixed with, and sold for, <HI>Jallap,</HI> worth about six shillings the pound? That <HI>Jallap,</HI> and other <HI>harsh purgatives,</HI> are used in the lenitive Elec∣tuary and <HI>Daffey</HI>'s Elixir, instead of <HI>Sena?</HI> That common <HI>Resin</HI> is mixed with and sold for <HI>Resin</HI> of <HI>Jallap?</HI> That two considerable <HI>nominal Druggists</HI> bought up several hundred weight of a certain <HI>a∣stringent dying stuff,</HI> seized by an ignorant examiner of drugs at the Custom-house for Sena, of which it had hardly any outward resemblance, and to which it was diametrically opposite in quality, mixed it
<PB N="59" REF="59"/>with, and sold it for <HI>Sena?</HI> That <HI>Gamboge</HI> is mixed with, and sold for, <HI>Turpeth Mineral?</HI> That <HI>red Lead</HI> is mixed with the <HI>red,</HI> and <HI>white Lead</HI> with the <HI>white Precipitates</HI> of <HI>Mercury?</HI> And that <HI>Spanish</HI> White, or <HI>Whiting,</HI> of about a groat a stone, is sold for <HI>white Lead</HI> which is worth so much the pound? and (some say) even for <HI>Diaphoretic Antimony?</HI> Do not most <HI>seeds</HI> lose their <HI>medicinal virtues</HI> with their <HI>vegetative quality?</HI> and yet, are not the seeds sold among us, usually such, the very useless sweepings of Seed-mongers-shops? Is not the Vinegar of <HI>Squills</HI> generally made with <HI>green</HI> instead of <HI>dry</HI> squills, which are ordered by the Dispensatory; tho' it is apparent to common reason, that they are rather preserved, than yield their virtues in that manner? and this only, because that root loses about one half of it's weight in drying? I wish I could say no more! and I am sorry to say, that every sensible man, who has taken pains to learn and pry into the secrets of <HI>our Pharmacy,</HI> must know these and many more, and must answer these <HI>Quaere's</HI> in the af∣firmative.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured to lay before you a short sketch of the most common, <HI>wilful abuses</HI> of Apothecaries and Druggists, which alone may shew, how the Dishonest injure the KING <HI>'s Revenues,</HI> impose upon the <HI>Public</HI> in general, and prejudice every branch of the <HI>Healing Art,</HI> the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> in particular, the honest of whom are grievously op∣pressed by the <HI>fraudulent.</HI> See p. 52.</P>
<P>As these are the effects of sordid avarice and dege∣neracy, no honest intelligent man can, with a clear conscience, conceal them. Such errors as proceed from pure, simple ignorance, as <HI>destilling Sal Ammo∣niac</HI> in <HI>iron, tin,</HI> or <HI>leaden pots,</HI> when every operator of judgement must know, that, that Salt, from it's known subtilty and aptness to enter the pores of metals, and dissolve them, was by the Chemists called, <HI>The Key to Metals;</HI> and it has been proved
<PB N="60" REF="60"/>by a most accurate observer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, Fundam Chym. dogm. &amp; experim. c. v.</NOTE>, <HI>that all metals are sensibly affected by destilling spirit of Sal Ammoniac from them,</HI> and that, consequently, nothing but glass can withstand it's penetrating force effectually; as like∣wise <HI>destilling sundry spirits, oils,</HI> and <HI>waters,</HI> and the <HI>boiling</HI> or <HI>infusing sirups, decoctions, infusions, oils, ointments,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>untinned copper bodies</HI> or <HI>vessels,</HI> which manifestly alters their properties; and their <HI>levi∣gating</HI> testacious and other hard bodies upon soft stones, by which means, <HI>Cursor</HI>'s-stream black flag has been often sold for Crabs-claws, Corral, nay, for Pearl, Bezoar, and other precious stones, if they ever used any, after being first infected by powdering in a soft brass mortar: These, I say, I could pass over in compassion and charity, and not impute them as <HI>crimes</HI> to any; they, indeed, call for <HI>reformation;</HI> but wilful and apparently pernicious corruptions and abuses cry aloud for a <HI>scourge.</HI></P>
<P>When apothecaries become such <HI>obstinate, hardy malefactors,</HI> what can it tend to less than the utter subversion and ruin of <HI>physic,</HI> which is so connected with, and has so great a dependence on, <HI>pharmacy,</HI> that they must necessarily rise and fall with each other?—I would ask the judicious tender physi∣cians and chirurgeons, are they not often in more pain than some of those they prescribe for, when they do not know what shop their prescriptions may fall into, on the due preparation of which the health or life of the patient, as well as their credit and re∣putation, depends? How vain and uncertain are all their most accurate observations on diseases and the effects of remedies rendered by the various diversifica∣tion of their prescriptions; when the same <HI>recipe</HI> shall produce different effects, according to the several shops it has been prepared in? Who can presume to prescribe the well-known doses of the most powerful and efficacious chemical medicines, the <HI>mercurial</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="61"/>preparations especially, when less than a sixth of an ordinary dose has been found to induce the most baneful symptoms?—But hap what will, the apo∣thecary knows he is sase; let him but vend his wares, it is all he seeks. As for mischances, those can only fall upon the patient and prescriber, and if, perchance, he is suspected, as he attends closely, and, perhaps, for that end, he speaks first, and soon acquits himself with impunity; and tho' <HI>conscious</HI> of the <HI>badness,</HI> or, at best, <HI>uncertain</HI> of the <HI>goodness</HI> of his medicines, having <HI>bought,</HI> not <HI>prepared</HI> them, frames many artful excuses, and never fails to heap the scandal of their ill success on the defenceless prescriber, which is justly due to his ignorance, dis∣honesty, or neglect.</P>
<P>Bad as the consequences of the forementioned <HI>cor∣ruptions</HI> prove, it were happy they had extended no farther. But this <HI>contagious degeneracy</HI> has now made such a surprising progress, that we have not only <HI>lost our art,</HI> but, with it, the <HI>knowledge</HI> of many of the most <HI>valuable simples,</HI> and use, in their stead, the <HI>most foreign</HI> and <HI>unnatural substitutes.</HI> Thus, for a small <HI>testaceous</HI> production, found in the stomachs of fresh-water crabs, or craw-fishes, called <HI>Lapides,</HI> or <HI>Oculi Cancrorum,</HI> Crab's-eyes, we do not blush to sell some small pellets of outlandish clay, artfully molded into the same form; even tho' it is obvious that they do not retain the least resemblance of the properties or virtues of the true <HI>Crab's-eyes.</HI>— Some of our learned naturalists<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoffman. Obs. phys. chym. lib. ii. obs. i. Boerhaav. E∣lem, chem. Tom. ii. p. 241. Geoff. Lectures on Mater. Med.</NOTE> affirm, that what we now use for <HI>Nitre</HI> is extremely different from the <HI>Nitre</HI> of the <HI>antients,</HI> in appearance and effects. In like manner, that noble styptic and vulnerary, <HI>Ro∣man Vitriol,</HI> is not to be seen among us; yet we do not scruple selling for it <HI>Hungarian</HI> or <HI>Cyprus Copperose,</HI> tho' of quite another nature, and as different in
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>color and appearance, as well as effects, as <HI>green</HI> from <HI>blue.</HI>—A man can hardly hear the name of <HI>Arsenic</HI> without horror, from the frequent deadly effects of that drug; and yet we are well assured, that the <HI>Arsenic</HI> of the <HI>Antients</HI> was <HI>no more a poison,</HI> than any other active medicine; for the yellow, called <HI>Auri-pigmentum,</HI> and the red, called <HI>Sanderacha,</HI> were both given internally by <HI>Hippocrates, Dioscori∣des, Avicenna, Fallopius,</HI> and others. <HI>M. Geoffroy,</HI> aforesaid, says, that the <HI>Indians</HI> drink wine infused in arsenical cups as a sovereign remedy; and it is most certain that we never have had any just com∣plaints, or even mention, made of the least ill effects from either, until the <HI>factitious</HI> kind (a most incor∣rigible poison, and utterly unknown to the antients) falsely usurped it's name and place; whereby the true <HI>native Arsenics,</HI> being more rare, became quite ne∣glected, and are now buried in oblivion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoffm. Obs. phys. chym. lib. iii. obs. i. Boerhaav. Elem. chem. Tom. i. p. 26, 27.</NOTE>. Thus likewise <HI>Turpentine,</HI> a balsamic exudation from the <HI>Terebinthus</HI> or Turpentine-tree, and even that from the <HI>Larix</HI> or Larch-tree, which is yet more common, and called <HI>Venice-Turpentine</HI> (tho' improperly) is now scarcely ever seen, and hardly known, among us; because the cheaper <HI>substitutes</HI> of the <HI>resins</HI> of <HI>firs, pines,</HI> &amp;c. and their <HI>oil</HI> (which is falsely called, and sold for, <HI>oil</HI> of <HI>Turpentine</HI>) blended together by fire, is sold in it's place by the <HI>druggists,</HI> vastly cheaper than the genuine can be imported for. This vile cheat has been often openly detected in this king∣dom. An experienced <HI>artificer in frauds,</HI> well versed in thus counterfeiting the works of Dame Nature, and who produced more Turpentine, in his way, annually, than many of the largest trees in the <HI>Vene∣tian</HI> territories, had his artifice brought to <HI>light</HI> by his composition's taking fire, and burning his and some neighbouring houses in a certain great city;
<PB N="63" REF="63"/>and tho' he might have justly dreaded another fate, yet has he lived to apply to himself a phrase taken from the regeneration of the Phaenix, often misapplied by canting, false chemists, <HI>Damnum reparabitur Igni;</HI> which is, indeed, verified. For, that <HI>base incendiary</HI> has, by that accident, been raised out of dust, ashes, and poverty, by the generous (but misapplied) con∣tribution of the citizens.—We have an account of one that died a martyr to this cause in the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dublin</HI> Journal, <HI>Aug.</HI> 9, 1740.</NOTE>.—If any honest industrious man should be at the pains to procure these things genuine, what must he do with them? Long disuse has ren∣dered them now unknown, and besides, his custo∣mers can only judge of the different rates, and not the qualities, of medicines; so he is reckoned an extravagant extortioner, and loses their favour and custom, and the commodities may lie upon his hands till they perish before he can sell them to advantage. Thus, unlike all other artists, <HI>is the just, conscientious apothecary to be requited!</HI></P>
<P>I could now most willingly drop the ungrateful task of exposing men's faults, were it not necessary to <HI>a perfect cure,</HI> to dive into the bottom of their <HI>morbid state.</HI> In hopes, that when all are exposed to open view, you with the rest of the great <HI>physici∣ans</HI> of the STATE when next in <HI>consultation assembled,</HI> may apply some remedy to this cursed, <HI>chronic distemper.</HI></P>
<P>It may be thought probable, when men might, in the most considerable instances, gratify their shame∣ful avarice with the greatest secrecy and impunity, that they would not hazard a discovery, (tho' there was no law to punish them) by a more open trans∣gression, which every body may detect: But see how a long habit of iniquity, at once obdurates the hearts, and captivates the senses of the feeble, wicked, wretch!</P>
<PB N="64" REF="64"/>
<P>The <HI>apothecaries</HI> and <HI>druggists</HI> not content with the fairest opportunities of <HI>defrauding</HI> the public in al∣most every other respect, must deceive every customer, patient or prescriber, by altering the weights and measures directed by ours, and almost all other col∣legiate dispensatories in <HI>Europe,</HI> for I can affirm, that they are not smaller in any.</P>
<P>When a physician writes for an <HI>ounce</HI> of any me∣dicine, he expects <HI>eight drachms</HI> of <HI>sixty grains</HI> each, according to the table of weights prefixed to the dispensatory; but he unexpectedly falls short of a∣bout <HI>fifty four</HI> grains. For instead of the <HI>medical</HI> the <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>avoir-du-poize</HI> weights are used, each ounce of which contains but about <HI>seven drachms</HI> and <HI>six grains</HI> of the former weight. The evils arising from this practice are not in many cases less detri∣mental to the public, than the frauds and abuses already mentioned in medicines.</P>
<P>All the officinal compositions, and extemporane∣ous prescriptions, are so calculated by the prescribers, that if duly prepared according to their intentions, they must necessarily know to the greatest exactness, the quantity of the <HI>principal,</HI> and indeed of every <HI>respective</HI> ingredient contained in a dose, or any given quantity of the mixt medicine. Thus for instance, <HI>four scruples</HI> of <HI>Venice Treacle</HI> are known to contain <HI>one grain</HI> of <HI>opium, half a drachm</HI> of <HI>the Earl of Warwick's powder, eighteen grains</HI> of <HI>scam∣mony,</HI> and so forth. Without knowing this to the greatest certainty, no man can safely prescribe; for by this rule it is, that all mixt or compound medicines are dosed and prescribed. But as the weights are now confounded, it is not possible for a physician to adjust the dose of any composition with the least certainty. Suppose, for example, an electuary is prescribed; in every <HI>ounce</HI> of which it is intended there should be <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>twenty grains</HI> of <HI>opium,</HI> or of any strong purgative or other active medicine, of so great energy, that it required the greatest accura∣cy
<PB N="65" REF="65"/>in the dosing. This electuary instead of being dispensed by the <HI>proper</HI> weights, is done partly by the <HI>avoir-du-pois</HI> and partly by the <HI>medical;</HI> for the <HI>pounds, ounces</HI> and <HI>half ounces</HI> are of the <HI>former,</HI> but the <HI>drachms, half drachms</HI> and <HI>scruples</HI> of the latter <HI>denomination</HI> in our shops. So that instead of <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>twenty grains</HI> in <HI>one ounce,</HI> or <HI>eight drachms,</HI> here is the like number of grains in <HI>seven drachms</HI> and <HI>six grains</HI> of this electuary: And as the same dispro∣portion holds in all other compositions, the <HI>grains not varying in any weights,</HI> so the physician in this respect too, is exposed to the most dangerous <HI>decep∣tion;</HI> for his patients must be frequently <HI>over dosed</HI> in the chief, active ingredients in his prescriptions, and in the more simple, <HI>under dosed,</HI> as every ounce given wants almost one eighth. This dire confusion increases with the weights; for the <HI>medical pound</HI> is above <HI>two ounces</HI> l ghter than the <HI>avoir-du-pois</HI> What a doubtful, inconsistent medley must such compositions be, as are dispensed thus unjustly and irregularly?</P>
<P>The same irregularity has likewise confused the <HI>medical measures;</HI> which are <HI>gallons, pints</HI> or <HI>pounds,</HI> and <HI>ounces,</HI> used in the dispensation of certain liquids. For tho' <HI>apothecaries</HI> may have <HI>just ounce measures,</HI> yet if <HI>four ounces</HI> of any simple water are prescribed, the <HI>naggin</HI> is most commonly used, which wants a∣bout half an ounce of the intended, <HI>just measure.</HI> This is of the same consequence with the errors in weights; as <HI>laudanum, opium,</HI> &amp;c. which are weigh∣ed, are often intended to be conveyed in proper doses, in certain proportions of juleps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are <HI>mostly measured.</HI>—How unlikely then is the best physician to cure his patients, when tho' he should get good medicines, which is above twen∣ty to one against him, yet they are assuredly not dispensed by the <HI>weights</HI> or <HI>measures</HI> he expects or intends: So that it is great odds, his prescriptions are by this means too frequently abused or misapplied!</P>
<P>One thing more (tho' out of place) I must here
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>observe <HI>my brethren</HI> yet to blame in, and that is the unprecedented, evil custom of keeping several <HI>de∣structive poisons</HI> and <HI>poisonous drugs,</HI> not at all used in medicine, promiscuous in their shops, with sundry other drugs of great and near resemblance in out∣ward aspect; which are often handled, weighed in the same scales, powdered or otherwise prepared in the same mortars or other utensils, and upon the same compters, where divers medicines are handled, weighed or prepared.</P>
<P>Insatiable avarice, which begot an inordinate de∣sire of extending the profession of pharmacy, to grasp at things out of it's way and reach, for the sake of lucre; first made apothecaries <HI>poisoners</HI> in any in∣stance, and probably the words <HI>pharmacus,</HI> and <HI>pharmacum,</HI> synonymous for <HI>apothecary, villain</HI> or <HI>poisoner, remedy</HI> or <HI>poison.</HI>—Sure no man can be insensible of the dire effects of handling or keeping poisons near medicines, when it is notorious that the baneful dust of such, nay the very <HI>effluvia</HI> of some, contaminate the very ambient air, and con∣sequently every thing it touches. Can it be from any other cause than their too near vicinity to the <HI>factitious Arsenic</HI> boxes, that so mild and inoffensive things as <HI>burnt Heart's horn</HI> and <HI>cream of Tartar</HI> have often induced the most dreadful sickness and vomitings, and to some proved deadly? un∣less the cream of Tartar is adulterated, as we have too much reason to doubt, with <HI>Willis, Riverius,</HI> and <HI>Harris</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pharmacolog. anti-empiric, p. 150. &amp; seq.</NOTE>. Have we not had many melancholy instances of fatal miscarriages in this way, from such shops as deal in poisons? And if these do not convince the <HI>mercenary apothecaries and druggists</HI> of their <HI>errors,</HI> and dissuade them from this dangerous practice for the future, the force of reason will pro∣bably prove fruitless, and we may expect relief in this, as well as the forementioned grievances, from nothing less than a severe, rigorous law.</P>
<P>No <HI>apothecary</HI> or <HI>druggist</HI> in <HI>London</HI> transgresses in
<PB N="67" REF="67"/>this instance. <HI>Color-selling</HI> there, is a quite distinct branch of trade: And the <HI>color-men</HI> who profess that alone, are as ignorant of medicinal drugs (if possible) as any of our <HI>pretended apothecaries</HI> or <HI>druggists.</HI> This gives them more leisure, and makes them more careful and solicitous to improve, and cultivate that business. Whence we find the <HI>colors, oils, vernices,</HI> &amp;c. are with them properly treated, and so to be had pure and good in their kind: which is more than our <HI>color-men</HI> can say for these or any of their proper commodities.</P>
<P>If <HI>apothecaries</HI> and <HI>druggists</HI> had not fallen into a most abject state of sloth and stupidity, it would not have been necessary to make this <HI>second applica∣tion</HI> to PARLIAMENT, for laws to restrain them from this <HI>manifest evil</HI> at least. They might con∣sider, that hitherto they have been treated like an∣tient <HI>Spartans,</HI> while their crimes lay hidden; but to risk a discovery of <HI>all,</HI> by such transgressions as must be <HI>obvious</HI> to vulgar eyes, is surely the worst po∣licy: Methinks those that <HI>will steal,</HI> should, like the <HI>Spartan youth, let the Fox tear the loins, and even con∣sume the bowels, rather than it should appear who stole him;</HI> unless he, thro' a sense of <HI>penitence,</HI> discovers.</P>
<P>I shall now close this section with one short re∣flection.</P>
<P>If this <HI>cursed apostacy,</HI> this <HI>fatal degeneracy,</HI> which we here complain of, and most earnestly desire to be reformed, had tended to no worse an evil, than the <HI>ruin</HI> and <HI>subversion</HI> of one of the <HI>most antient, noble</HI> and <HI>useful</HI> ARTS, to say nothing of it's bring∣ing it's eldest twin-sister, PHYSIC (which must necessarily rise and fall with it) to the ground, and was not attended with that dismal train of evil consequences to mankind in general which we daily discover, sure the vile <HI>miscreants</HI> who have brought it to this low pass, and rendered it destructive in∣stead of useful to the public, must be deemed most highly culpable, and the most unworthy members of human society; as the destroyers of useful arts
<PB N="68" REF="68"/>are deservedly reckoned more criminal and despi∣cable, than the inventors or improvers of them have been accounted beneficent and honorable. And since it is apparent, that PHARMACY is an Art which the three first ranks of men among the antients, to wit, KINGS, PRIESTS, and PRO∣PHETS, did not disdain to cultivate and occupy, as both sacred and prophane histories evidently testify; an <HI>art</HI> which is the <HI>mother</HI> and <HI>nurse</HI> of many <HI>others;</HI> and which in it's <HI>purity</HI> contributed to the preservation, not only of the living, but like∣wise of the dead Bodies of the illustrious; in fine an <HI>art</HI> which, under GOD, is one of the principal agents in preserving the noblest machine of the Almighty's creation from disorder, in restoring it when disordered, and when by time it's springs and movements are worn out, and it's actions there∣by cease, keeps it from corruption and decay for many ages: And since it is now manifest, that this <HI>excellent art</HI> has been effaced, perverted, and almost quite obliterated, by the pernicious <HI>abuses, corrup∣tions</HI> and <HI>frauds</HI> of <HI>apothecaries and druggists,</HI> surely the subject of it's <HI>restoration</HI> and <HI>reformation</HI> well deserves the serious attention of PARLIAMENT; as by the wise interposition of that alone, we may hope to see PHARMACY rescued from the hands of barbarous <HI>assassins,</HI> revived, and once more shine in it's pristine lustre and beauty, restored to it's original use, worth and dignity. This is all that now seems wanting to bring the <HI>practice</HI> of <HI>phy∣sic</HI> to it's <HI>primitive certainty,</HI> which by the foremen∣tioned <HI>errors</HI> and <HI>impositions,</HI> has been long rendered <HI>precarious</HI> and <HI>uncertain.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Order now leads me to the fourth and last thing proposed, namely, to offer some means to pre∣vent such horrid mal-practices for the future, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I have in the foregoing, endeavoured with the greatest care and impartiality to state the <HI>case</HI> of <HI>pharmacy,</HI> to the best of my power. As the <HI>dis∣temper</HI> is most inveterate, perplexed, and complicate,
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>so to prescribe adequate remedies for it, requires a <HI>consultation.</HI> But from the unjust opposition and ill usage I met with from the fraternity, in my <HI>late attempt</HI> to reclaim the profession, I can neither ask nor expect their assistance or concurrence in this <HI>Essay.</HI> Therefore, as necessity requires it, I must <HI>alone</HI> venture to offer my best thoughts upon the whole, tho' it is an hard task, and prescribing, in either <HI>physic</HI> or <HI>law,</HI> not my proper province.— Before my prescriptions are put in practice, let my worthy seniors justly correct and reprove me; I shall receive their amendments with plea∣sure, and shall chearfully assent with every good man, that shall rationally treat this <HI>luxuriant evil.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When the source of a distemper is known, the me∣thod of cure is least difficult;</HI> and <HI>when the cause of a disorder is removed, the effect of course must cease.</HI> The <HI>former</HI> I think I have discovered, the <HI>latter</HI> there are various ways of bringing about. <HI>Physici∣ans,</HI> as far as it may be consistent with reason, and the safety of the <HI>sick,</HI> gratify their taste and adapt medicines to their <HI>gouts</HI> and weakly appetites. We know of old, that the <HI>distempered apothecaries</HI> and <HI>druggists,</HI> have the most <HI>vitiated palates</HI> and very <HI>weak, squeamish stomachs,</HI> and that they never yet could <HI>relish</HI> or <HI>digest any remedy</HI> given to alter or amend their <HI>morbid habit of body.</HI> Tho' many mild, rational attempts were made to restore them to their <HI>natural health,</HI> they would never consent to use the means directed. At length, wearied with trying all the just methods, that must with sensible men have prevailed, the college of physicians final∣ly, began to treat them, as real <HI>Maniacs</HI> required, with <HI>Helleborine</HI> and other <HI>drastic</HI> remedies, which indeed had no better effect; for like true <HI>Bethlemites,</HI> they spurned the medicines, and when by force they were poured down their throats, they spewed them in their <HI>Archiators'</HI> faces. This will need no expla∣nation when you recollect the violent opposition both publicly and privately made to the bill de∣pending
<PB N="70" REF="70"/>in the House of Commons in the year 1725, <HI>to prevent abuses in the practices of physic and pharmacy.</HI> In like manner in the year 1735, when the act now in force took it's rise in the House of Lords, tho' the whole fraternity privately and publicly confessed <HI>a reformation greatly wanting,</HI> and tho' some of the most eminent among them <HI>approved of the means then proposed,</HI> yet did they jointly, unanimously oppose it, and published a <HI>case</HI> which they laid before the house; in which they asserted many weak falshoods, and made sundry, trivial and ridiculous evasions, to prevent farther inquiries being made into their <HI>habitual frauds,</HI> or any laws passing to restrain them from their <HI>long ac∣customed, evil practices.</HI> These instances I think ne∣cessary, to shew, how averse these men are and ever have been to <HI>reformation.</HI> I am sorry to say it looks, <HI>as if they had loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</HI> For since no man can fear that <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>integrity</HI> can suffer by an <HI>open examination</HI> or any <HI>fair test,</HI> sure this aversion thereto is another plain proof of the necessity for some effectual law; which I humbly conceive may be made very con∣veniently by adding a few, proper clauses to the <HI>present act:</HI> And I submit it to your judgement, whether or no, it may be expedient to make the following amendments in that bill, and whether they may or not, answer the good purposes de∣signed.</P>

<P>The reasons for these several proposed amend∣ments, I hope, are evident from the foregoing; if not, I believe I shall be able to shew them when re∣quired.</P>
<P>Although I have been obliged to protract this Letter beyond the intended length, in order to give a just, clear Notion of the whole matter, and to ob∣viate any difficulties or objections that may arise, or be made against it, by designing men; yet I must beg you will with patience, and your usual candor, now hear me a few words in mine own behalf.</P>
<P>From the unexpected ill treatment I met with in a former weak attempt of this kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A short scheme for preventing frauds and abuses in phar∣macy, 1735. on which the present Act was founded.</NOTE>, it is easy to conceive what I may now expect from many of the Gentlemen who call themselves <HI>Apothecaries, Chemists,</HI> and <HI>Druggists</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es by which most Apothecaries, Druggists, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> re∣gistred themselves by the Act in the year 1736.</NOTE>, tho' I flatter myself I do in some sort deserve the thanks of every man, who would <HI>honestly</HI> follow any of these occupations; my design being only to shew, who is <HI>properly</HI> and <HI>truly an apo∣thecary</HI> or <HI>druggist,</HI> and what the proper <HI>office</HI> and <HI>duty</HI> of each; together with the necessity of their adhering to their immediate respective professions, solely, diligently. Notwithstanding, I look for the taunts and outcries of the multitude of ignorant, idle, selfish, and invidious men, among us, against me, in every shape. However, I shall not think myself obliged to take the least notice of <HI>self-interest∣ed back-biters,</HI> nor their <HI>pyratical Missionaries,</HI> who will probably, as before, go about industriously to
<PB N="77" REF="77"/>blast my credit, and asperse and villify my character; not even<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remarks upon the Scheme for preventing frauds and abuses in Pharmacy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wrote by a certain Quack Apothecary.</NOTE> <HI>anonymous, scribbling privateers,</HI> or <HI>hackney-pamphleteers.</HI></P>
<P>Some will perhaps advance with the humorous <HI>Garth</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dispens.</HI> Cant. iii.</NOTE>, <HI>that,</HI></P>
<Q><L>That juggler which another's slight will shew,</L>
<L>But teaches how the world his own may know.</L></Q>
<P>To this indictment I shall, according to form, plead, <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> and so put myself, for trial, on my <HI>customers</HI> and the <HI>public.</HI></P>
<P>But the grand insinuation in my prejudice, which has heretofore been made and will now probably be revived, is, <HI>that regardless of all public good, in unreasonable aversion and apposition to my fraternity, and by way of advertising and extolling my self, by depretia∣ting them, I have turned a reformer, being in every instance acted more by selfish mercenary views, than any other.</HI>—This, I hope, to every considerate unpreju∣diced reader, will appear as malicious, and as ground∣less, as the rest of their base detraction is false and uncharitable. I challenge any man to say, I was e∣ver once known to lessen the just merits of any apo∣thecary or druggist whatsoever. Had I none other motive than common policy, I should not attempt to recommend my self to the world by such low, mean artifice: moreover, let it but be considered, did I heretofore, or do I now offer ought to the detri∣ment of any honest, just apothecary, chemist or druggist? If I have, I declare it the effects of mere inadvertency; for it is not to be reasonably imagined, that I should knowingly do any thing to the prejudice of a profession, which I have made my choice, by which I have hitherto lived, and still purpose to follow, as long as the same excellent set of customers, which have hitherto dealt with me,
<PB N="78" REF="78"/>and most nobly and generously encouraged me, are pleased to continue their unmerited favors. In the next place, I submit it to the judgement of every candid breast, what <HI>mercenary views</HI> I could have had in this undertaking. I believe it is evident, tho' I was at great expence, and much trouble in writing and printing, and in attending the parlia∣ment in the year 1735, that, instead of gaining any selfish advantages thereby, or in any sort solliciting for such, I have been a considerable sufferer, if it were by none other means, than bringing upon me (tho' I hope undeservedly) the implacable hatred and en∣mity of all the apothecaries and druggists. And I hope there are some men of quality and distinction, still living, who can attest, that tho' I was incou∣raged to sue for a parliamentary reward, yet I just∣ly disdained all applications for the like, being con∣tent with the public good, which was likely to ac∣crue from my weak endeavours. <HI>Vertue to a prepared heart, never fails of bringing an ample, concomitant re∣ward.</HI></P>
<P>This I will however confefs; that I have some <HI>selfish private</HI> (tho' not altogether mercenary) <HI>views,</HI> in solliciting a reformation of pharmacy, and a strict examination of apothecaries and their shops, because I would from my <HI>self,</HI> as well as <HI>others,</HI> remove all temptations to the abuse or corruption of my profes∣sion, and by all ways and means, promote the know∣ledge thereof, and give all reasonable encouragement to following it strictly, justly, and faithfully. And I conceive the examination of apothecaries and drug∣gists, and the inspection of their shops, would be one motive; as it must prove as advantageous to e∣very skilful honest apothecary and druggist, as it must be disadvantageous to the unskilful and dis∣honest. Moreover, as the apothecaries and drug∣gists, have been very active, and I have some rea∣sons to judge, there are some of them still unwearied in wounding my character and reputation, in the most false, malicious, and uncharitable manner; I
<PB N="79" REF="79"/>hope it is not culpable in me to seek, with the re∣dress of a general grievance, a public method of confuting those groundless calumnies. For in such a trial, I flatter my self, it will appear, that if I should not have had as fair an opportunity of learn∣ing <HI>pharmacy,</HI> or as good a capacity, as many of those, who make a better figure in the profession; I have taken more pains in acquiring some know∣ledge in it, in order to make amends for such <HI>dis∣advantages,</HI> and to supply such a natural <HI>defect.</HI></P>
<P>I might have taken the usual liberty of dedicators, and here claim a sanctuary to my self, and this poor performance, by prefixing your illustrious name. But even this is an artifice I despise; for if it has not merit enough to maintain it's ground, tho' cloathed in this mean simplicity, let it be rejected, or fall unregarded.</P>
<P>From one of your great humanity, refined taste, and just notions of morality, I fear I may dread some censure for an unbecoming zeal, in using thro' this discourse some <HI>terms of reproach, expressions, which may bespeak an unseemly freedom with my frater∣nity,</HI> or such as <HI>as may savour somewhat of spleen or in∣vective.</HI> In this respect, perhaps, I am to blame, but when you consider how difficult it is to treat such vile offenders as I complain of more properly, or for a man of any conscience, or understanding, barely to mention such base degeneracy, such abominable perfidious villainy, as I have laid before you, or even but to think of the like, without some heat, indig∣nation, and abhorrence, I hope it will, in some mea∣sure, plead my excuse. I have industriously avoided personal reflections; except where the offenders were so singularly notorious, that they must be known to many, by mentioning their crimes only. And altho' I have from many of the society, received much un∣kind, ungenerous, and I may say, uncharitable, un∣christian treatment; and altho' the dignity of the parliament-house in full session, could not protect me from their violent rage, and merciless insults,
<PB N="80" REF="80"/>not only in the offices adjoining, but even at the bar of the <HI>House</HI> of PEERS; yet, I most solemnly aver it to you, that it is not the persons, but their vices I detest, and would expose. I know there are still among them, men of distinguished worth and candor, who are ready and willing to suffer a refor∣mation; and I am inclined to think, that many of those, who formerly opposed it, were led thereto by inadvertency, or the clamors of the multitude. If any thing I have said should offend, or seem le∣velled at particular persons, I must say with the in∣genious <HI>Garth,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to Dispens.</NOTE><Q>"it is at such only as are presu∣med to be engaged in dishonourable confederacies (against the public and) against the dignity of their own profession; but if there be none such, then these characters are but imaginary, and conse∣quently ought to give no body offence."</Q>—</P>
<P>I conclude with the words of the late learned doctor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pinac. natur. Rerum Britt. Praef.</NOTE> <HI>Merret,</HI> on another occasion.— <Q>"Acrem me habebunt verissimumque vindicem, fraudesque detegam ab artis hujus incunabilis in hunc usque diem usurpatas; idque reipsa comprobabo haud suspectae fidei testimoniis; simulque omnia stigmata societati nostrae inusta detergam."</Q>—</P>
