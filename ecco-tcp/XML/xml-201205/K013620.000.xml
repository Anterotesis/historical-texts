<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Health is the noblest blessing of this life, the method of pro∣curing it should be our principal en∣quiry. While possessed of it, we seldom pay a proper attention to its importance; when lost, we become sensible of its value, but are frequently careless con∣cerning its recovery. The reasons are plain; while we have it we trifle with it till it flies us; when fled, we trifle with our misfortune, because we suppose the recovery to be either impossible or im∣probable.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
<P>For the benefit of mankind, we here furnish the public with some of the best and easiest methods of recovering and securing health, and of preserving life, which comprehend the greatest disco∣veries in the Medical Art. These will equally suit all ranks of people; the <HI>Poor,</HI> because the Remedies may be <HI>cheaply</HI> obtained; and the <HI>Rich,</HI> because they may be <HI>easily</HI> put in practice. Hence <HI>Health</HI> may be recovered with <HI>Facility,</HI> and a <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the powers of me∣dicine obtained without <HI>Difficulty.</HI> So that our readers may at once cease to be <HI>Patients</HI> themselves, or, if they please, become <HI>Practical Physicians</HI> to others.</P>

<HEAD>SCURVY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Scurvy being the principal disease inci∣dent to the inhabitants of Great Britain, and the source from whence many of their other disorders flow, we thought it necessary to commence this salutary Work, with an account of the nature of, and the remedies against, this fatal foe to ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONS.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="symptoms">
<HEAD>SYMPTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>THE symptoms or signs of this dangerous disease are a frequent laziness and lowness of spirits, pains in various parts of the body, sometimes livid spots, often a sallow complexion, a continual itching of the blood, difficulty of breathing, swelling of the legs, bleeding
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>at the nose, and spongy gums, subject to pains and bleedings. But it is to be observed, that as consti∣tutions differ, the signs or symptoms of the disease vary; and people, according to their years, situations in life, and manner of living, are attacked by this disease, under several appearances; but some of the above symptoms always attend it according to the constitution of those afflicted; for whose benefit we shall point out the most approved and certain me∣thods of cure hitherto discovered.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>REMEDIES.</HEAD>
<P>A Milk diet, with weak whey, greens of all kinds, fresh vegetables, fruits, acids, scurvy-grass ale, fresh beer and cyder, tar water taken twice a day, with camphire, one scruple, aethiops mineral, half an ounce, powder of gum-guaiacum, two drachms, ho∣ney, one ounce, mix and make an electuary, and take the bigness of a nutmeg every night going to rest. The patient may likewise drink the decoction of the woods. Drinking sea-water will be found extremely beneficial, as will bathing in the sea.</P>
<P>But for the easiest and most efficacious remedy for this dreadful disease, we may thank Capt. Cook, who in his late voyage round the world, by the command of his present MAJESTY in the ship <HI>Resolution,</HI> pre∣served himself and all his men from the Scurvy, by the use of a very simple medicine; though he passed through the temperature, the frigid and the torrid zones, was absent from England three years and eigh∣teen days, and went through such a variety of cli∣mates, as were sufficient to make the severest attacks on the most robust constitution. But as his methods of proceeding will appear with most propriety in his own words, we shall present our readers with his Letter to Sir <HI>John Pringle,</HI> Bart, President of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> which letter is dated <HI>March</HI> 5, 1776;
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>and for which Captain Cook received a Premium Medal.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"AS many gentlemen have expressed some surprize at the uncommon good state of health which the crew of the <HI>Resolution,</HI> under my command, ex∣perienced during her late voyage; I take the liberty to communicate to you the methods that were taken to obtain that end. Much was owing to the ex∣traordinary attention given by the Admiralty, in causing such articles to be put on board, as either by experience or conjecture were judged to tend most to preserve the health of seamen. I shall not trespass upon your time in mentioning all those articles, but confine myself to such as were found the most useful.</P>
<P>"We had on board a large quantity of malt, of which was made sweet-wort, and given (not only to those men who had manifest symptoms of the scurvy, but to such also as were, from circumstances, judged to be most liable to that disorder) from one to two or three pints in the day to each man, or in such proportion as the surgeon thought necessary; which sometimes amounted to three quarts in the twenty-four hours. This is without doubt one of the best antiscorbutic sea-medicines yet found out; and if given in time will, with proper attention to other things, I am persuaded, prevent the scurvy from making any great progress for a considerable time: but I am not altogether of opinion, that it will cure it in an advanced state at sea.</P>
<P>"Sour-krout, of which we had also a large pro∣vision, is not only a wholesome vegetable food, but, in my judgment, highly antiscorbutic, and spoils not by keeping. A pound of it was served to each
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>man, when at sea, twice a week, or oftener when it was thought necessary.</P>
<P>"Portable soup, or broth, was another essential article, of which we had likewise a liberal supply. An ounce of this to each man, or such other pro∣portion as was thought necessary, was boiled with their peas three days in the week; and when we were in places where fresh vegetables could be pro∣cured, it was boiled, with them and with wheat or oatmeal, every morning for breakfast, and also with dried peas and fresh vegetables for dinner. It enabled us to make several nourishing and whole∣some messes, and was the means of making the peo∣ple eat a greater quantity of greens than they would have done otherwise.</P>
<P>"Further, we were provided with rob of lemons and oranges; which the surgeon found useful in se∣veral cases.</P>
<P>"Amongst other articles of victualling, we were furnished with sugar in the room of oil, and with wheat instead of much oatmeal, and were certainly gainers by the exchange. Sugar, I imagine, is a very good antiscorbutic; whereas oil, such at least as is usually given to the navy, I apprehend has the contrary effect. But the introduction of the most salutary articles, either as provision or medicines will generally prove unsuccessful, unless supported by certain rules of living.</P>
<P>"On this principle, many years experience, to∣gether with some hints I had from Sir Hugh Palliser, the Captains Campbell, Wallis, and other intelligent officers, enabled me to lay down a plan whereby all was to be conducted. The crew were at three watches, except upon some extraordinary occasions. By this means they were not so much exposed to the weather as if they had been at watch and watch; and they had generally dry cloaths to shift themselves when
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>they happened to get wet. Care was also taken to expose them as little as possible. Proper methods were employed to keep their persons, hammocks, bedding, cloaths, &amp;c. constantly clean and dry. Equal pains were taken to keep the ship clean and dry between decks. Once or twice a week she was aired with fires; and when this could not be done, she was smoaked with gunpowder moistened with vinegar or water. I had also frequently a fire made in an iron pot at the bottom of the well, which greatly purified the air in the lower parts of the ship. To this and cleanliness, as well in the ship as amongst the people, too great attention cannot be paid; the least neglect occasions a putrid offensive smell below, which nothing but fires will remove; and if these be not used in time, those smells will be attended with bad consequences. Proper care was taken of the ship's coppers, so that they were kept constantly clean. The fat, which boiled out of the salt beef and pork, I never suffered to be given to the people, as is customary; being of opinion that it promotes the scurvy. I never failed to take in water wherever it was to be procured, even when we did not seem to want it; because I look upon fresh water from the shore to be much more wholesome than that which has been kept for some time on board. Of this essen∣tial article we were never at an allowance, but had always abundance for every necessary purpose. I am convinced that with plenty of fresh water, and a close attention to cleanliness, a ship's company will seldom be much afflicted with the scurvy, though they should not be provided with any of the antiscorbutics before-mentioned. We came to few places where either the art of man or nature did not afford some sort of refreshment or other, either of the animal or vege∣table kind. It was my first care to procure what could be met with of either, by every means in my
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>power, and to oblige our people to make use thereof, both by my example and authority; but the benefits arising from such refreshments soon became so obvious, that I had little occasion to employ either the one or the other.</P>
<Q><P>"These, Sir, were the methods, under the care of Providence, by which the <HI>Resolution</HI> performed a voy∣age of three years and eighteen days, through all the climates from 52 degrees north to 71 degrees south, with the loss of one man only by disease, and who died of a complicated and lingering illness, without any mixture of scurvy. Two others were unfortu∣nately drowned, and one killed by a fall; so that of the whole number with which I set out from England, I lost only four.</P>
<P>"I have the honour to be, Sir, &amp;c."</P></Q>
</LETTER>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Captain <HI>Cook</HI> to Sir <HI>John Pringle,</HI> Bart. dated <HI>Plymouth Sound, July 7, 1776.</HI></HEAD>
<Q>"I entirely agree with you, that the dearness of the rob of lemons and oranges will hinder them from being furnished in large quantities, but I do not think this so necessary; for though they may assist other things, I have no great opinion of them alone. Nor have I an higher opinion of vinegar: my people had it very sparingly during the late voyage; and towards the latter part, none at all; and yet we experienced no ill effects from the want of it. The custom of washing the inside of the ship with vinegar I seldom observed, thinking, that fire and smoak answered the purpose much better."</Q>
</LETTER>
<P>To the above we shall subjoin the following re∣marks on Captain Cook's judicious procedure; with some other interesting particulars; being a summary of the discovery of the great antiscorbutic virtues of sweet-wort by Dr. Macbride, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>"CAPTAIN COOK begins his lift of stores with
<PB N="11" REF="11"/><HI>malt:</HI> "Of this," he says, "was made sweet-wort, and given not only to those men who had manifest symptoms of the scurvy, but to such also as were judged to be the most liable to it."</Q> Dr. Macbride, who first suggested this preparation, was led, as he says, to the discovery by some experiments that had been laid before the Royal Society; by which it appeared, that the air produced by alimentary fermentation was endowed with a power of correcting putrefaction. The fact he confirmed by numerous trials, and finding this fluid to be <HI>fixed air,</HI> he justly concluded, that whatever substance proper for food abounded with it, and which could be conveniently carried to sea, would make one of the best provisions against the scurvy; which he then considered as a putrid disease, and as such to be prevented or cured by that powerful kind of antiseptic. Beer, for instance, hath always been esteemed one of the best antiscorbutics; but as that derived all its <HI>fixed air</HI> from the malt of which it is made, he inferred, that malt itself was preferable in long voyages, as it took up less room than the brewed li∣quor, and would keep longer sound. Experience hath since verified this ingenious theory, and the malt hath now gained to much credit in the navy, that there only wanted so long, so healthful, and so cele∣brated a voyage as this, to rank it among the most indispensable articles of provision. For though Cap∣tain Cook remarks, that <Q>"a proper attention to other things must be joined, and that he is not altogether of opinion, that the wort will be able to cure the scurvy in an advanced state at sea; yet he is per∣suaded, that it is sufficient to prevent that distem∣per from making any great progress, for a con∣siderable time;"</Q> and therefore he doth not hesi∣tate to pronounce it, <Q>"one of the best antiscorbutic medicines yet found out."</Q></P>
<P>This salutary <HI>gas,</HI> or <HI>fixed air,</HI> is contained more
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>or less in all fermentable liquors, and begins to op∣pose putrefaction as soon as the working or intestine motion commences.</P>
<P>In wine it abounds, and perhaps no vegetable sub∣stance is more replete with it than the fruit of the vine. If we join the grateful taste of wine, we must rank it first in the list of antiscorbutic liquors. Cyder is likewise good, with other vinous produc∣tions from fruit, as also the various kinds of beer. It hath been a constant observation, that in long cruizes or distant voyages, the scurvy is never seen whilst the small-beer holds out at a full allowance; but that when it is all expended, the disorder soon ap∣pears. It were therefore to be wished, that this most wholesome beverage could be renewed at sea; but our ships afford not sufficient convenience. The Russians however make a shift to prepare at sea, as well as at land, a liquor of a middle quality between wort and small-beer, in the following manner. They take ground malt and rye meal in a certain proportion, which they knead into small loaves, and bake in the oven. These they occasionally infuse in a proper quantity of warm water, which begins so soon to fer∣ment, that in the space of twenty-four hours their brewage is compleated, in the production of a small, brisk, and acidulous liquor, which they call <HI>quas,</HI> palatable to themselves, and not disagreeable to the taste of strangers. The late Dr. Mounsey, member of the Royal Society, who had lived long in Russia, and had been <HI>Archiater</HI> under two successive sovereigns, says, that the <HI>quas</HI> was the common and whole∣some drink both of the fleets and armies of that em∣pire, and that it was particularly good against the scurvy. He added, that happening to be at Moscow when he perused the "Observations on the Jail-Fever," published here, he had been induced to compare what he read in that treatise with what he
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>should see in the several prisons of that large city: but to his surprize, after visiting them all, and find∣ing them full of malefactors, for the late empress then suffered none of those who were convicted of capital crimes to be put to death, yet he could dis∣cover no fever among them, nor learn that any acute distemper peculiar to jails had ever been known there. He observed that some of those places of confine∣ment had a yard, into which the prisoners were al∣lowed to come for the air; but that there were others without this advantage, yet not sickly: so that he could assign no other reason for the health∣ful condition of those men than the kind of diet they used; which was the same with that of the common people of the country, who not being able to pur∣chase flesh-meat live mostly on rye-bread, (the most acescent of any bread) and drink <HI>quas.</HI> He con∣cluded with saying, that upon his return to Peters∣burg, he had made the same enquiry there, and with the same result.</P>
<P>Thus far my informer: from whose account it would appear, that the rye-meal assisted both in quickening the fermentation, and adding more fixed air; since the malt alone could not so readily pro∣duce so acidulous and brisk a liquor. And there is little doubt, but that whenever the other grains can be brought to a proper degree of fermentation, they will more or less in the same way become useful. That oats will, I am satisfied, from what I have been told by one of the intelligent friends of Captain Cook. This gentleman being on a cruize in a large ship, in the beginning of the late war, and the scurvy breaking out among his crew, he bethought himself of a kind of food, he had seen used in some parts of the country, as the most proper on this occasion. Some oatmeal is put into a wooden vessel, hot water is poured upon it, and the infusion continues until
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>the liquor begins to taste sourish; that is, till a fer∣mentation comes on, which in a place moderately warm may be in the space of two days. The water is then poured off from the grounds, and boiled down to the consistence of a jelly. This he ordered to be made, and dealt out in messes, being first sweet∣ened with sugar, and seasoned with some prize-wine he had taken, which, though turned sour, yet improved the taste, and made this aliment no less palatable than medicinal.</P>

<P>THE urine of the person afflicted is high co∣loured, and has a sandy sediment of a reddish cast; the part affected looks red and is swelled. The pain is exceedingly acute, as if the bone was broken and, is succeeded by a slight fever, and a chilness or shiver∣ing, which seizes the great toe, ancle, heel, calf of the leg, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>REMEDY.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the afflicted go to bed at night, they should take a tea spoonful of volatile tincture of guaiacum in a glass of water: keep themselves warm, and drink sack whey. Exercise is very requisite for those afflicted with this disorder.</P>
<P>As the duke of Portland's Gout Powder is re∣markably efficacious in the cure of this disorder, we shall here transcribe the receipt for making it.</P>
<P>TAKE of round birthwort root and gentian root, of the tops and leaves of germander, ground pine, and centaury: take of all these, well dried, powdered and sifted as fine as possible, an equal quantity; mix them well together, and take one drachm of this mixed powder every morning fasting in a cup of wine and water, broth, tea, or any other vehicle you like best;
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>keep fasting an hour and an half after it. Continue this medicine for three months without interruption, then diminish the dose to three quarters of a drachm for three months longer, then to half a drachm for six months more, taking it regularly every morning if possible. After the first year, it will be sufficient to take half a drachm every other day. As this medicine operates insensibly, it will take, perhaps, two years before you receive any great benefit; so you must not be discouraged, though you do not perceive at first any great amendment; it works slow but sure: it doth not confine the patient to any particular diet, if he lives soberly, and abstains from those meats and liquors that have always been accounted pernicious in the gout; as champaign, drams, high sauces, &amp;c.</P>

<P>BE covered warm when you go to bed, and take a drachm of powder of gum-guaiacum.

<DIV3 TYPE="disorder">
<HEAD>FEVERS.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="symptoms">
<HEAD>SYMPTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two principal sources of fevers, one comprehends the causes which render the blood and other fluids of the body too thick; the other includes those which make them too thin. Let us now exa∣mine how one sort may be distinguished from the other.</P>
<P>It should be observed, that in all fevers of every kind, there is a morbid or malignant quality intro∣duced and subsisting in the blood as the productive cause; and the proper means for curing them are such methods and medicines as by experience have been found effectual for removing their morbid qua∣lity, and recovering the sick in the shortest time.</P>
<P>In some persons, when there is too much blood, such bleeding may be advised as will draw off the excess, except in pestilential distempers, in which blood-letting has proved almost always mortal, even in the bodies fullest of blood; this evacuation must
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>be moderately used in pleurisies, as the extremity of pain and difficulty of breathing shall acquire it.</P>
<P>That the common people (who generally know when persons have fevers) may have a little more knowledge of these acute diseases, and how to dis∣tinguish one kind of them from the other; the per∣son who is to direct for the sick, should carefully enquire into the state of his body; he should exa∣mine his pulse. Let him feel the pulse of two or three that are in health, and his own pulse; and then compare them with the pulse of the patient, and thereby he will come nearly to know how much it differs from the healthful standard, as to quickness or slowness, and as to its strength and weakness, and be able to deduce some conclusions which may guide his conduct; then let him learn the degree of febrile heat; and one way to do this may be by feeling the side of the neck below the ears (through which the large blood vessels pass to and from the brain) and thus the degree of the heat of the blood may be known; and the other symptoms of the patient should be particularly enquired into.</P>
<P>If the heat of the body be excessive, the pulse quick and strong, the flesh very dry, the pores of the skin very close, and the thirst very great, it may be concluded that the cause which produced that fever has rendered the blood too thick.</P>
<P>If the pulse is too quick, and not strong, and the heat of the body not great; if the tongue is very black or dry, and the thirst is great, or it the patient voids blood by urine, or spitting, or at his nose, or by stool; or if he has flat spots on his skin, black or reddish in colour, or if he has a great looseness, with watery or thin stools; or if he has profuse sweats, with a sensible sinking of his spirits, and decrease of strength, it may be inserted, that the fever is of a putrid kind.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="cure">
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
<HEAD>REMEDIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE following general rules should be observed: to drink as plentifully as possible some diluting liquor whenever thirsty, such as barley-water, mint and balm and sage tea, thin water-gruel, or beef tea made as follows:</P>
<P>Take a pound of lean beef, out it small, pour upon it two quarts of water, boil it for the space of five minutes, then keep for use.</P>
<P>To use such nutritious food, as most freely may be taken, because it abates the acrimony of the blood, repairs the waste of the body, and is one of the best cordials; small whey made with Canary or Mountain wine may be frequently used.</P>
<P>It may be necessary, before we proceed farther, to premise that in liquid, by four table spoonfuls, is meant half a gill, or two ounces; two spoonfuls one ounce, one spoonful half an ounce, or four drachms.</P>
<P>If seized with any feverish complaint, take the fol∣lowing mixture.</P>
<P>Salt of wormwood, two drachms, lemon juice, or any acid, a sufficient quantity to make a neutral me∣dicine, sugar about two drachms, common water about half a pint, and about two ounces of nutmeg water, or any spirit; mix together, and take two spoonfuls every three hours.</P>
<P>At night take a little sweat going to rest, and the next morning continue the mixture. Or if incon∣venient to make up the above medicine, or too poor to get it, we recommend Salt Petre as an efficacious as well as cheap remedy.</P>
<P>We shall mention one instance of its utility. A poor woman asked advice for her husband (a man about forty years of age) who had a fever, with a violent pain in his side, and was light-headed at times.</P>

<P>We advised her to get an ounce of salt-petre, and powder it; then to divide it into four equal parts, and each of them into four others for so many doses, each of which will contain about half a drachm, directing that she should give one of them, dissolved in a coffee dish of sage tea, sweetened with sugar to his palate every three or four hours; and when he had taken this salt, she came and said, that his fever was gone; but that his cough remained. We then advised her to give him about twenty drops of balsam capivi, with powder sugar, night and morning; and he happily recovered.</P>
<P>But if troubled with a cough, add, of sperma-ceti in powder two drachms; dissolved with the yolk of an egg, to be taken in the same manner.</P>
<P>Or, if that cannot be had, the following powder.</P>
<P>Take sperma-ceti in powder, half an ounce; sugar and salt-petre each two drachms; mixt together, and take as much as will lay on a shilling every three or four hours in any liquid.</P>
<P>If bound, take the following opening mixture.</P>
<P>Take two drachms of senna leaves, boil in ten ounces of common water to eight ounces; strain off, and add manna half an ounce, tincture of senna one ounce; mix, and take two table spoonfuls every three hours, till it operates.</P>
<P>This medicine is easily prepared, and very handy on many occasions, especially when the body calls for a remedy of this nature; it is cooling as well as lax∣ative; washes its passage through the bowels, without any griping or disorder, and stands in need at the same time of no over strict regimen.</P>
<P>Thus far fevers in general; proceed we therefore to those more particular.</P>

<HEAD>Of an Acute Inflammatory Fever.</HEAD>
<P>THE young, robust plethoric habit, will ever be most liable to inflammations; whilst, on, the contrary,
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>in the weakly and infirm, the circulation cannot readily be worked up to such a pitch as is requisite to constitute a disease of an inflammatory kind; in both, cold or obstructed perspiration is almost the only occasional cause. This fever may be easily known from the constitution of the sick person; a quick, full and tense pulse, hard beyond its natural state; florid countenance, with great heat and thirst, acute pains in the head, back and loins, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To the cure of an inflammatory fever therefore it is necessary, first, to take away about six or eight ounces of blood, then give about fifteen grains of Ipecacuanha in a cup of any liquid, and work it off with camomile flower tea, having nothing after it that night, but a little mulled wine to settle the stomach.</P>
<P>Tartar emetic two grains, diaphoretic antimony, ten grains, barley water, eight ounces; mix and take two spoonfuls every four hours; and every now and then about as much salt-petre as will lay on a shilling dissolved in the drink.</P>
<P>If all this should not open the body, it will be ne∣cessary to add an emollient clyster.</P>
<P>If at the end of the disease the pulse should flag, discontinue the medicines, and use cordials.</P>
<P>If an intermission should happen, with gentle sweats, and turbid urine; the bark in small doses or rather a decoction of it, may be thrown in.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of a nervous Fever.</HEAD>
<P>THIS low nervous fever is directly opposite to the acute inflammatory, and therefore must be dif∣ferently treated.</P>
<P>It mostly happens from profuse evacuations, and to those of relaxed solids, and dissolved watery fluids; the pulse, though quick, is here weak and low, the heat of body but little beyond the natural, and the
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>symptoms in general of the spasmodic kind, and in∣dependent of inflammation.</P>
<P>In the one it becomes necessary to lower the im∣petus of the circulation, by evacuations and coolers; in the other, the warm cordial, the stimulating me∣dicines are by all means adviseable to excite the vis vitae, and promote such a degree of fever as may suffice for its expulsion.</P>
<P>Evacuations of blood, and by stool, can then be, of no service in the cure of a low fever, but a great detriment. A gentle vomit in the beginning, and a breathing sweat throughout its continuance will be useful.</P>
<P>A warm, light, nourishing diet, and plenty of generous wine will be expedient, with blisters and si∣napisms, or mustard plaisters and other drawers of the feet, for the relief of the symptoms.</P>
<P>First then give the ipecacuanha vomit, with the mulled wine as before described; and going to bed, half a drachm of mithridate. The next day the fol∣lowing mixture.</P>
<P>Take Venice treatle, two drachms, syrup of saffron, half an ounce, simple mint water, eight ounces, strong cinnamon water, two ounces, volatile tincture of valerian, two drachms, mix, and take two spoon∣fuls every three or four hours.</P>
<P>To these may be added, as occasion requires, a little opiate camphire, contrayerva, valerian, cochi∣neal, warm aromatics, and some volatile salts; and when better, the gum pills; but if towards the latter end of the disease, when gentle sweats break out, and the urine becomes turbid or thick, the bark will be attended with great advantage, though there should appear no intermission.</P>

<P>ACCORDING to the air, constitution and strength of the patient, intermittents frequently vary, some will have a tendency to the inflammatory, or degene∣rate into an acute continual fever, especially if too hot a regimen has been used; which if it should have been the case, gentle cooling purges will reduce it, and then give the bark with nitre joined with it. On the contrary, intermittents will urge on the nervous fever; in which case join the cordial aromatics, such as snake root, contrayerva, myrrh, camphire, and the like, with the bark.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>REMEDIES.</HEAD>
<P>TO cure an intermission, the following is ad∣viseable.—Best bark, one ounce, finely bruised; snake root, two drachms, finely bruised; boil in common water from a pint and a half to one pint, strain it off, and take four spoonfuls every three or four hours. If it should purge, add to each dose five or six drops of liquid laudanum; if it should bind, about five or six grains of powdered rhubarb; if want of appetite, about five or six drops of elixir of vitriol.</P>
<P>A variety of different medicines have been found to succeed, but the preference has ever been given to the bark; twelve drachms of which generally puts by the fit, though it is necessary to continue a few doses more to prevent a return.</P>
<P>One or two grains of Roman vitriol given, during the intermission, two, three, or four times in the twenty-four hours; or about a drachm of allum, with thirty grains of nutmeg, or snake-root, in half a pint of warm ale or barley water has suc∣ceeded well.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
<P>Intermitting Fevers, those especially whose fits re∣turn every other day, have been often cured with a few doses of cochineal, by taking about half a drachm of it in powder, some time before the accession of each fit; and others have been recovered, by taking five, six, or seven grains of the Virginian snake root, three times on the days of intermission, at about four or five hours distance; and I have with success ad∣vised some of the poor to drink a quarter of a pint of tea, made with the root of burdock, every third or fourth hour, during the intermissions, sweetened with sugar, or not sweetened, as the patient chuses.</P>
<P>These sort of intermittents allow a good opportu∣nity for taking the Peruvian bark, and that the poor, those great objects of our compassion and charity, may have the benefit of that excellent remedy, at the least expence, advise the following method, viz.</P>
<P>To buy an ounce of the best bark in powder, then divide it into eight or twelve equal parts, and take a dose of it every third hour, during the intermissions, beginning as soon as they are quite free from a fit, in the following manner, viz.</P>
<P>Mix a dose of the bark, with a tea cup of hot wa∣ter, with which it will mix easily; and when it is cool enough, then let the patient drink it, and take after it a glass of punch, made in the common way, and take his meals at his usual times. Suppose the time for taking the bark happens at the time of din∣ing, let him first take the bark, and then eat his din∣ner. I have done so myself.</P>
<P>We advise the patient to take the bark in the night, as well as in the day, which I have done my∣self several times, having a person to sit up and wake me, when the time for taking the bark comes.</P>
<P>If the patient can take a drachm of the bark for a dose, without finding his stomach loaded, let that quantity be the dose; and when he has taken one
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>ounce, though he misses the fit, yet let the bark be prepared, and the doses taken at four hours dis∣tance.</P>

<P>HECTIC Fevers with coughs, are commonly called Consumptions, on account of the great waste, or decrease of the bodies afflicted with them.</P>
<P>The symptoms, which are obvious, and necessary consequences of an ulcerated state of the lungs, are a cough, a copious spitting of a purulent-like mat∣ter, which is thrown up night and morning, and if tried, sinks in water.</P>
<P>Oppression of the breast, bad appetite, thirst great, hectic fever, colliquative sweats, which succeed night and morning alternately, a lowness, and great dis∣charge of urine, the pulse becomes quick and sharp, the body pines, and is emaciated, and its several functions totally impaired and decayed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>REMEDIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE air where the patient lies ought to be free and pure, the constitution must be kept in action, and take as much exercise every day as it can bear.</P>
<P>Horse-riding, giving the body motion with little fatigue, if convenient, is preferable to any carriage, which should be before dinner, else it proves hurtful. Great care must be taken to prevent catching cold by damp things or otherwise.</P>
<P>A southern voyage by sea frequently cures, when all things else fail, provided the provisions are fresh; and as milk cannot there be easily obtained, fruits, broths and balsamics must supply the place.</P>
<P>A proper regimen, with the patient's own endeavours,
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>act mostly towards the cure; a mind kept easy, with varying objects to divert the attention; yet it may be necessary to subjoin some serviceable medicines.</P>
<P>First, I would recommend for diet, light, but re∣storative, and diluting drink. Milk, asses milk, (if obtainable) water-gruel made of meal, or fine white flour, with a little butter or sugar, or cyder whey, or barley water, or ground-ivy tea sweetened with sugar or honey, acidulated with the juice of lemon, or an apple boiled in a pint of water, with one large spoon∣ful of brandy, and sweetened as before directed, as necessary to promote the spitting up the phlegm.</P>
<P>Secondly, to remove the fever, give the following medicine:</P>
<P>Salt-petre, two drachms; cochineal, half a drachm; pure water, half a pint; syrup of balsam, or sugar, or honey, sufficient to pallate; brandy, or rather rum, two ounces; mix these and take two spoonfuls every third or fourth hour.</P>
<P>If there should be a flux, then the following:</P>
<P>Tincture of roses, one pint; liquid laudanum, twenty grains; drink a cupful often.</P>
<P>If restless at night, take storax pill, four grains. When there is great difficulty of breathing, the am∣noniac medicine, with the oxymel of squills, give the most relief.</P>

<P>THESE disorders, which go under the different names of morbid, malignant, putrid, pestilential, petechial, hospital, and goal fevers, differ only in a degree from each other.

<P>The symptoms in general are lassitude and weak∣ness, or loss of strength, an oppression or pain in the stomach, pulse low or weak, bitter taste in the mouth, drowth, foetid breath, a dejected mind, frequently sighing, wanting to vomit, great pain in the head, back, and loins, tongue black, chaped, though at first white, and small spots about the skin, resembling the measles, but of a purple or livid colour. Eyes heavy, yellowish and inflamed, and frequently pro∣fuse sweating.</P>

<P>BLEEDING here is to be avoided as most dan∣gerous: and the first thing, clear the stomach by Ipe∣cacuanha wine, about one ounce, worked off with camomile flower tea, and mulled wine at night.</P>
<P>Then begin and take the recipe prescribed for in∣termitting fevers, and drink weak mountain whey,
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>with tincture of roses plentifully acidulated, with the elixir of vitriol. Likewise the following bolus, three times a day, in some tormentile root tea, and sweetened with the finest sugar.</P>
<P>Powder of valerian, ten grains; powder of snake root, ten grains, cochineal, four grains, gum cam∣phire, five grains; syrup of saffron, a sufficient quan∣tity to bind it.</P>
<P>If bound, the bowels should be gently opened by powdered rhubarb, in small doles; and, if occasion, emolient clysters; if a diarrhoe, or purging, cordial restringents, and gentle opiates occasionally; omit all volatiles as prejudicial.</P>

<P>In all obstructions, if the patient's strength will admit of it, draw off about eight ounces of blood, give some cooling, gentle, opening medicines, with a little sweet oil, and foment the part with a decoction of mallows, or camomile flowers; let there be drank often some diluting liquor, with about forty nitre drops in it, and every six hours, about one drachm of Castile soap, dissolved in any liquid, especially if small gravel comes away with the urine, or it should be bloody; for when small stones are lodged in the kidneys, which comes away with the urine, it is called gravel; but when they lodge some time in the bladder, they collect together, form a body, and accumulate fresh matter, begin to be too large to pass off with the urine, and then is called a stone.</P>
<P>When afflicted with the stone, avoid all aliments of a windy or heating nature, all salt meats, sour fruits, acids of all kinds, use every thing that pro∣motes the secretion of urine, and keeps the belly open, artichoaks, asparagus, lettuces, &amp;c. are pro∣per; and to drink milk and water, barley water, decoctions of marshmallows, parsley, liquorice, lin∣seed, or gin and warm water mixt, not too strong; use gentle exercise, and take soap lees, beginning with thirty or forty drops, in a cup of lime water, every night and morning, and increase the dose re∣gularly to sixty drops, as the stomach will bear.

<P>The taking of these medicines must be continued for some time after the complaint is removed, lest any part of the stone should remain, which being rough and unequal, might occasion exquisite pain.</P>
<P>It is common, after a few days use of these medi∣cines, to have an increase of pain in making water, at which time a soft diet, emollient drinks and rest are proper. For common drink milk and water, or a decoction of marshmallow roots, parsley and li∣quorice may be used; but if the person has been used to strong liquors, small punch, made without acid, may be drank sparingly. Artichoaks, asparagus, spinage, lettuces, succory, parsley, turnips, potatoes, radishes, peas, &amp;c. may be safely used; but onions, leeks, and celery, are to be preferred to all other vegetables.</P>
<P>The patient ought to drink no more of any liquor than is sufficient to quench his thirst, and he should hold his water as long as he can without great un∣easiness, that it may have the longer time to act in the stone.</P>

<P>THE piles are of a two-fold nature, the bleeding piles, and the blind piles; the former, when there is any discharge, the latter, when there is not.</P>
<P>Persons of a bulky size, who lead an inactive life, and live high, are most subject to this disease, though it is sometimes hereditary, and then it attacks more early in life than when it is accidental. They may be occasioned by an excess of bloody by strong aloetic purges, high seasoned foods, by drinking great quan∣tities of wines, the neglect of any customary eva∣cuations, much riding, great costiveness, or any thing that occasions hard or difficult stools. Pregnant wo∣men are sometimes afflicted with them.</P>

<P>IF only little swellings within and without the fundament, touch them with a little oil of amber. Or, take lime water, four ounces, liquid laudanum, half an ounce, mix together, and make a linament so bathe the parts with it very often.</P>
<P>If they are bleeding piles, care must be taken not to stop them too soon, especially if they are pe∣riodical, and return frequently, as they prove salutary; but if they continue in such quantity as to waste the patient's strength, hurt his digestion, or impair any functions, then a proper regimen and astringent me∣dicines must check the discharge.</P>
<P>A linen cloth dipped in camphorated spirits of wine, may be applied to the parts, and a bread and milk poultice, if excessively painful, or a little cool∣ing ointment of elder, equal parts of each mixed together; a dose of manna and salts, or sena tea, or some cooling physic given in the morning, and an electuary made of one ounce of lenitive electuary, flower of brimstone, half an ounce, of cream of tar∣tar, two drachms, syrup of roses, a sufficient quan∣tity to mix together; then take the bigness of a nut∣meg twice a day, occasionally.

<HEAD>BITE OF A MAD DOG.</HEAD>

<HEAD>SYMPTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is necessary to mention the signs by which a dog that is mad may be known.</P>
<P>A mad dog is seemingly rapacious and thirsty, yet eats and drinks nothing; his eyes are fierce and flaming; he hangs down his ears, and thrusts out his tongue; froths much at the mouth, and barks at his shadow; oftentimes runs along sad and anxious without barking at all; frequently pants for breath, as if tired with running; carries his tail bent inwards; runs without distinction against all he meets, with great fury, and bites; hurrying on in an hasty and un∣certain course. Dogs that are well are afraid and fly, both at the sight and barking of one that is mad. The first mad symptom in a dog, is an un∣usual trembling.</P>
<P>With respect to the symptoms in persons bit, they are, principally, confused and mischievous looks, and an utter abhorrence of water.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>REMEDIES.</HEAD>
<P>MIX one pound of common salt in a quart of water, and then squeeze, bathe, and wash the wound with the same for an hour, and not drink any of it; then bind a little salt to the part affected for twelve hours. But be very careful to apply it instantly after the bite of the animal.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
<P>Take the leaves of rue, picked from the stalks and braised, six ounces; garlic picked from the stalks and bruised, Venice treacle and mithridate, and the scrap∣ings of pewter, of each four ounces; boil all these over a slow fire, in two quarts of strong ale till one pint be consumed; then keep it in a bottle close stop∣ped, and give nine spoonfuls to a man or woman, warm, seven mornings following, fasting, and six spoonfuls to a dog.</P>
<P>This will not fail, if it be given within a few days after the biting of the dog. Apply some of the ingredients from which the liquor was strained to the bitten place.</P>
<P>Bathing in the sea, where the patient can be accom∣modated with conveniences, is likewise deemed an ad∣mirable remedy.</P>
<P>To this we may add, that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o cure the bite of a viper or adder, if you will rub the part bitten with some of the fat of the animal, it will prevent any bad effects from arising; but if the fat of the animal can∣not be procured, warm sallad oil will be attended with the same good consequences.</P>

<P>The doctor prescribes bleeding and blistering in the neck, and behind the ears, in order to draw off the humours from the eyes; and afterwards, accord∣ing to the degree of inflammation, or acrimony of the juices, to make a drain by issues between the shoulders, or perpetual blister. And for washing the eyes, recommends cold spring water. And the best inward medicines, which he has experienced, to be conserve of rosemary flowers; anti-epileptic powders, such as Purvis ad Guttetam, betony, sage, rosemary, eye-bright, wild valerian root, castor, &amp;c. washed down with a tea made of the same ingredients; as also drops of spirit Lavandulae Composit, and sal. vol. oleos.</P>
<P>If the inflammation returns, the Dotor says, drawing about six ounces of blood from the temples, by leeches, or cupping on the shoulders, is very proper.</P>

<P>ULCERS are wounds or sores of long Continu∣ance, and their symptoms virulent matter issuing from them.</P>

<P>To forward the cure, salt meat, spices, and strong liquors must be most avoided: the usual quantity of flesh meat should be lessened, and the body be kept moderately open, by a vegetable, or milk diet; and if the ulcers are in the legs, it is of great importance to keep in a lying posture; for negligence in this material point changes the slightest wounds into ulcers, and the most trifling ulcers into obstinate and incurable ones.

<HEAD>The METHODS pursued by the <HI>Humane Society</HI> for the Recovery of Persons apparently dead by Drown∣ing.</HEAD>
<P>THE society established in London for the re∣covery of persons apparently drowned, induced by a principle of humanity, have undertaken to make public the following methods of treating such cases, which are now practised in several countries of Eu∣rope with amazing success; and which they earnestly recommend to the attention of every man, but par∣ticularly to those who live in sea-port towns, or places adjacent to rivers, brooks, ponds, &amp;c.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="method">
<HEAD>METHOD OF TREATMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. In removing the body to a convenient place, great care must be taken that it be not bruised, nor shaken violently, nor roughly handled, nor carried over any one's shoulders with the head hanging down∣wards, nor rolled upon the ground, or over a barrel, nor lifted up by the heels, except with the greatest caution. For experience proves, that all these me∣thods are injurious, and often destroy the small re∣mains of life. The unfortunate object should be cautiously conveyed by two or more persons, or in a
<PB N="52" REF="52"/>carriage upon straw, lying as on a bed with the head a little raised, and kept in as natural and easy a posi∣tion as possible.</P>
<P N="2">II. The body being well dried with a cloth, should be placed in a moderate degree of heat, but not too near a large fire. The windows or door of the room should be left open, and no more persons be admitted into it than those who are absolutely necessary, as the life of the patient greatly depends upon their having the benefit of a pure air. The warmth most promising of success is that of a bed or blanket, properly warmed. Bottles of hot water should be laid at the bottoms of the feet, in the joints of the knees, and under the arm-pits; and a warming-pan, moderately heated, or hot bricks, wrapped in cloths, should be rubbed over the body, and particularly along the back. The natural and kindly warmth of a healthy person lying by the side of the body, has been found in many cases very efficacious. The shirt or cloaths of an attendant, or the skin of a sheep fresh killed, may also be used with advantage. Should these accidents happen in the neighbourhood of a warm bath, brew-house, baker, glass-house, saltern, soap-boiler, or any fabric where warm lees, ashes, embers, grains, sand, water, &amp;c. are easily procured, it would be of the utmost service to place the body in any of these, moderated to a degree of heat, but very little exceeding that of a healthy person.</P>
<P N="3">III. The subject being placed in one or other of these advantageous circumstances, as speedily as possible, va∣rious stimulating methods should next be employed. The most efficacious are, to blow with force into the lungs, by applying the mouth to that part of the patient, closing his nostrils with one hand, and gently expel∣ling the air again by pressing the chest with the other, imitating the strong breathing of a healthy person: the medium of a handkerchief or cloth may be used
<PB N="53" REF="53"/>to render the operation less indelicate. Whilst one assistant is constantly employed in this operation, an∣other should throw the smoak of tobacco up by the fundament into the bowels, by means of a pipe or fumigator, such as are used in administering clysters: a pair of bellows may be used until the others can be procured. A third attendant should, in the mean time, rub the belly, chest, back and arms, with a coarse cloth or flannel dipped in brandy, rum, gin, or with dry salt, so as not to rub off the skin: spirits of hartshorn, volatile salts, or any other stimulating substance, must also be applied to the nostrils, and rubbed upon the temples very frequently. The body must at intervals be shaken also, and varied in its position.</P>
<P N="4">IV. If there be any signs of returning life, such as sighing, gasping, twitching, or any convulsive motions, beating of the heart, the return of the na∣tural colour and warmth; opening a vein in the arm or neck may prove beneficial, but the quantity of blood taken away should not be large; nor should any artery ever be opened, as profuse bleeding has appeared prejudicial, and even destructive to the small remains of life. The throat should be tickled with a feather, in order to excite a propensity to vomit; and the nostrils also with a feather, snuff, or any other stimulant, so as to provoke sneezings. A tea-spoonful of warm water may be administered now and then, in order to learn whether the power of swallowing be returned: and if it be, a table-spoon∣ful of warm wine, or brandy and water, may be given with advantage, but not before, as the liquor might get into the lungs before the power of swallow∣ing returns. The other methods should be continued with vigour, until the patient be gradually restored.</P>
<P>We have been as circumstantial as possible in the above directions, that if one conveniency should be
<PB N="54" REF="54"/>wanting, the attendants may not be at a loss for others. Where the patient has lain but a short time senseless, blowing into the lungs or bowels has been, in some cases, found sufficient; yet a speedy recovery is not to be expected in general. On the contrary, the above methods are to be continued with spirit for two hours, or upwards, although there should not be the least symptoms of returning life. The vulgar notion; that a person will recover in a few minutes, or not at all; and the ignorant, foolish ridiculing of those who are willing to persevere, as if they were attempting impossibilities, has most certainly caused the death of many who might other∣wise have been saved.</P>
<P>Most of the above rules are happily of such a nature, that they may be begun immediately, and that by persons who are not acquainted with the me∣dical art; yet it is always adviseable to seek the assistance of some regular practitioner as soon as pos∣sible; not only as bleeding is proper, and frequently necessary; but as it is to be presumed that such a one will be more skilful and expert, and better able to vary the methods of procedure as circumstances may require.</P>
<P>N. B. It is proper to observe, that these means of restoration are applicable to various other cases of apparent deaths; such as hanging, suffocation by damp and noxious vapours, whether proceeding from coal-mines, the confined air of wells, cisterns, caves, or the must of fermenting liquors; to those seized with apoplectic and convulsive fits, and also to the frozen.</P>
<P>Wherever any good has been produced by the means recommended, the person who has superintended the cure is desired to write a circumstantial account of it to James Horsfall, Esq; Treasurer, Middle Temple, or Mr. M. Robinson, Garden-Court, Mid∣dle Temple, Secretary to the Society.</P>

<P>EVERY, person, who sees others languishing under any sickness or distemper, if he has a mind to preserve himself from the infection, ought always to discharge his saliva, or spittle, and never swallow it, whilst he remains in the sphere of infected vapours; for the saliva is the first thing that very readily attracts the infected vapours, which being swallowed with it, are carried, as it were, by this vehicle into the stomach, where they occasion most fatal effects.</P>

This contagion, arising from the ferment that proceeds from the sick person, diffuses itself as a vapour in the ambient air, and infects every thing to a certain distance; so that these infected vapours, being drawn into the mouth by respiration, are capable of corrupting the saliva, which being swallowed, infects the stomach, and afterwards the rest of the body. But when one spits, the body is secured from infection.</P>
<P>For this reason tobacco, or spicey substances, or of a strong smell, kept in the mouth and chewed, for exciting the saliva, may be of great service to all those who visit infected persons.</P>

<HEAD>Directions concerning <HI>BLEEDING.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF all the remedies recurred to in relieving the diseased part of mankind, there are none of such general service and advantage, as that of bleed∣ing; as there is no one, on the other hand, attended with more pernicious consequences when indirectly and injudiciously ordered. A number of illnesses
<PB N="56" REF="56" MS="y"/>are absolutely owing to too great a quantity of blood; in which case there is ever of course an indispensable necessity for proportionably draining this fluid.</P>
<P>In all inflammatory distempers, it is next kin to a sacrilege to omit it: as it is, on the contrary, ex∣posing the patient to the utmost hazard, to injoin it in a low, languid, depressed state, where the spirits before were too much exhausted, and nature, con∣sequently, unable to support the least evacuation.</P>
<P>In a word, wherever prevail sore-eyes, a sciatic, a dry, husky cough, an head-ach, inflammations of the womb, or bladder, a virulent gonorrhoea, cordee, venereal stricture, inflamed piles, hot rheumatism, dry gripes, sore throat, an asthma, cholic, strangury, gravel, nephretic pains, haemorrhages, an inveterate itch, and the like, the opening of a vein is of peculiar service. But in dropsies, a jaundice, the gout, and all complaints arising from too great a relaxation of the vessels, or obstruction of them, remedies adapted to the respective disorders must be sought for from other specific quarters, without the least thought of increasing those disorders, by abrupt and preposterous bleeding.</P>
