<P>A PHYSICAL DISSERTATION ON DROWNING:</P>
<P>IN WHICH SUBMERSION, commonly call'd DROWN∣ING, is shewn to be a long Time consistent with the Continuance of LIFE, from a Va∣riety of unexceptionable tho' surprising FACTS, related by the most eminent and judicious Au∣thors, and confirm'd by incontestable Evidence; which FACTS are reconcil'd and accounted for, from the strictest Laws of the Animal Oeco∣nomy.</P>
<P>To which is SUBJOINED, The proper Measures for RECOVERY and RELIEF; the Obligations we lie under to practise them are clearly suggested, and strongly enforc'd; intended for the Good of Mankind, by restoring Life to many Persons, who are erroneously supposed to be irretrievably drowned. Recom∣mended particularly, to the Consideration of the Sur∣geons of the Navy and Army, who have frequent Oppor∣tunities of practising the Methods recommended.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE Recovery of PERSONS drown'd.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S Truth in general is of the last Im∣portance, not only in affording a noble and exalted Satisfaction to the Mind, but also in forming the Mo∣rals, and by that Means, promoting the most valuable Interests of So∣ciety; so nothing can be a greater Reproach to Reason, nor a more palpable Affront offered to its august and venerable Author, than that ignoble and unmanly Turn of Mind, commonly known by the Name of <HI>Credulity,</HI> which is no more than an implicit Contempt of Reason, and all the mental Powers, producing a Propensity to believe certain Tenets, Doctrines, or Facts, without that Degree of Evidence, which a Mind studious of Truth ought to require.</P>
<P>But however odious <HI>Credulity</HI> may appear, when painted in her native Colours, she is nevertheless,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>if we may be allowed the Expression, a <HI>Spectre,</HI> which haunts the various Classes and Distinctions of Mankind, under a Form so infatuating and alluring, as to seduce them from the plain and amiable Paths of Truth, and bewilder them in the dark and gloomy Labyrinths of Ignorance, Error, and Confusion. This deplorable Observa∣tion is in no Instance more effectually verified, than in these very Men, who profess a sacred Ve∣neration for Reason, and pretend to go wherever Truth shall conduct them; for, we frequently find, not only antient, but also modern Philoso∣phers and Physicians, labouring with a pompous Shew of Learning and Ratiocination, to prove that Nature, by her stated and established Laws, was capable of producing certain Effects, which Time has afterwards discovered never to have had any Existence, except in the Imaginations of the Credulous, or in the chimerical Works of Au∣thors, who forsaking Fact and Nature, have giv∣en a full Scope to their Fancy and Invention. Thus in former Ages it was keenly disputed, how it came about, that a small Fish, call'd the <HI>Remora,</HI> was capable of putting a speedy Stop to a Ship under Full-sail; but this pretended Fact has, by later and more penetrating Naturalists, been discover'd to be absolutely false. And, no doubt, the ever memorable Rabbit-Woman of <HI>Godalmin,</HI> would have made a considerable Fi∣gure in the Annals of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and af∣forded Matter to the Members for copious Dis∣sertations on the Force of Imagination, if she had prudently ceas'd Breeding a Day sooner. This bad Piece of Conduct, has, however, thrown an almost irreparable Disgrace upon <HI>natural Know∣ledge,</HI> by inducing the sober and judicious Part of Mankind to imagine, that it was totally employ'd
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>in explaining Visions and Chimeras. Therefore, if we intend to philosophise in such a manner as not to disgrace Philosophy, we must have Facts duly ascertain'd, before we attempt to explain and ac∣count for them; since, according to <HI>Kercher,</HI> in his <HI>Mund. Subterran.</HI> Lib. 10. <Q>"'Tis as absurd in physical Matters, to philosophise without Experience, as it is for a blind Man to pretend to judge of Colours."</Q></P>
<P>Tho' from what has been said, it sufficiently appears, that <HI>Credulity</HI> is fatal to Truth, yet we observe in the Minds of some Men, an arrogant and presumptuous <HI>Scepticism,</HI> which, admitting no∣thing but what is easy to the Conception of its Possessors, is no less prejudicial to the genuine In∣terest of Science, and Philosophy; for, as, by the former we are expos'd to the Danger of adopt∣ing Error as well as Truth; so by the latter our Minds are, as it were, manacled, and hinder'd from giving a rational Assent to Things and Facts cloath'd with the most striking and distinguish'd Characters of Evidence, for no other Reason, than that we cannot comprehend them. It is, for In∣stance, a culpable Diffidence, to disbelieve the Pos∣sibility of a Person's retaining a latent Principle of Life, after he has remain'd some Hours, Days, and even Weeks under Water, since numerous Facts, related by the best Authors, vouch'd by the most candid Witnesses, and recorded in the publick Archives of the most penetrating and sagacious Nations, concur to remove the smallest Remains of Uncertainty in this Point. Besides, I would have the Gentlemen of this Class remem∣ber, that their Conduct bespeaks an insupportable Degree of Pride, and amounts to a formal De∣claration, that they themselves are blessed with Geniuses far superior to others, since nothing can
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>be true, but what is comprehensible by the vast Extent of their Capacities. And tho' Modesty and Common-Sense, should not direct them to this Observation, yet what the World calls <HI>moral Evi∣dence</HI> stands upon Foundations, too stable and sure to be shaken by their frivolous Conceits, or ill∣grounded Remonstrances. In a Word, the wise and thinking Part of Mankind will always be in∣duc'd to give their Assent to Facts seen by a suf∣ficient Number of Witnesses, who have Sense e∣nough to guard against Imposture themselves, and Honesty enough to say nothing but what is Truth to their Neighbours. All these advantagious Circum∣stances attend the following Narrations, which, for the common Benefit of Mankind, have been collected from Authors of the greatest Veracity, in order to shew, that there is often a Possibility of restor∣ing drown'd Persons to Life, after vulgar Preju∣dice, and a Want of sufficiently extensive Views with Respect to the Laws of the animal Oeconomy, have laid a Foundation for concluding them irre∣trieveably dead, and past all Hopes of Recovery.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Bruhier,</HI> an eminent Physician of <HI>Paris,</HI> well known to the learned World, and highly esteem'd for his Knowledge in his Profession, a∣bout three Years ago, publish'd a Treatise on the <HI>Uncertain Signs of Death,</HI> tending to prove, that many People are interr'd before they are really dead; and that there are frequent Instances of Per∣sons who have liv'd many Days without Respira∣tion, or any other apparent Signs of Life. This Doctrine he establishes by many incontestable His∣tories of People who have actually surviv'd their Funerals, and liv'd many Years after they had been buried, upon a Supposition, that they were actually dead. Hence he very judiciously infers,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>that 'tis not imprudent but inhuman, to suffer the Interment of our Friends and Relations, before we are convinc'd from the most evident Marks, that they are certainly and irrecoverably deceas'd; or till such time as the Beginning of Putrefaction convinces us, that no Hopes remain of a Revival.</P>
<P>In Confirmation of what this celebrated Physi∣cian has advanc'd, many Examples might be found in our own Country, which escap'd his Re∣searches; and no doubt it happens much more frequently, than is generally imagin'd; especial∣ly in hysterical Women, in those who have con∣tracted a Habit of drinking spirituous Liquors to Excess, but particularly in those who have been guilty (for so I can't forbear calling it) of taking frequent Doses of Opium, or its Preparations, so as to render Life insupportable without them, of which there are too many Instances.</P>
<P>This Doctrine, however true, is not altogether modern; for we learn from <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> that the celebrated <HI>Empedocles</HI> acquir'd uncommon Honour, by restoring a Woman to Life who was thought to be dead many Days, and whose Dis∣order he discover'd to be only a Strangulation of the Uterus, that is, an hysteric Fit.</P>
<P>We learn, farther, that <HI>Heraclides</HI> of <HI>Pontus,</HI> a noted Philosopher, wrote a Treatise upon this ve∣ry Subject, which he intitled, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Of the Distemper in which the Patient is depriv'd of Respiration.</HI> In this he asserted, that the Disor∣der might continue thirty Days, during which there was no Respiration, or any other Signs of Life, without any Marks of Putrefaction; and that notwithstanding, the Patient might at last re∣cover.</P>
<P>In Consequence of the frequent Interments of People before they were really dead, Dr. <HI>Bruhier,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>in 1745, publish'd a small Pamphlet, containing Proposals for the Regulation of Funerals, and the Prevention of such calamitous Disasters; which he endeavours to have confirm'd by the Legislature; for, says he, how many Women weary of their Husbands, and Husbands equally weary of their Wives; how many Children who have either a real or an imaginary Reason to be dissatisfied with their Parents; and, especially, how many cove∣tous and necessitous Heirs, who have long waited for the happy Moment, which was to put him in Possession of an opulent Fortune, may not abuse the Liberty the Law affords them of burying their Friends at the End of twenty-four Hours, at which Time they may, possibly, be really alive, and capable of a Recovery. And to prove this Regulation the more necessary, he relates the fol∣lowing Histories.</P>
<P>A Woman about eighty Years old, being taken for dead, was about to be laid out as such, when a Person, who had perus'd his Treatise, oppos'd the Design. Next Morning the Woman was found recover'd from her profound Syncope, which, considering the intense Cold of the Season, had probably prov'd a real Cause of her Death, had she been taken out of her Bed.</P>
<P>It is also sufficiently known, that Cardinal <HI>Spi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>csa,</HI> first Minister to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> being supposed dead, and committed to a Surgeon in order to be embalm'd, thrust away the Hand which conducted the fatal Instrument, which put a real End to his Life. But notwithstanding this Accident, the barbarous Surgeon proceeded to finish the Operation.</P>
<P>But as Submersion, or Drowning, is the Subject of our present Enquiry, I shall only farther take Notice of the Histories relating thereto.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Kunckel,</HI> in <HI>Ephemerid. Nat. Curios.</HI> informs us, that a young Man had the Mis∣fortune to fall from a Boat into the Water, and sunk to the very Bottom, about fifteen hundred Paces, from the Shoar, which he did not reach till two Hours after. However, as it is natural for Persons to give an Account of the several Circumstances attending their respective States of Calamity and Distress, the young Man inform'd those who had the Curiosity to enquire into his Condition during that Time, that whilst he was making the most strenuous Efforts to preserve his Life, he thought of nothing but God, and the Means of recommending himself to his Favour and Acceptance; that the Voice of his darling Sister, who wept bitterly on the Shore, for the Fate of her Brother, had serv'd to conduct him to the Land; that the Disturbance of the Water by those who sought for him, and the Lamentations of the People on the Shore, were not only distinctly heard by him, but also prov'd extremely shock∣ing and uneasy to him; that he thought his Re∣spiration was carried on, without his knowing in what Manner, that the Water had not penetrated into any of the Cavities of his Body; and that he was hot, instead of being cold.</P>
<P>The same judicious Author informs us, that he had an Opportunity of examining a Fisherman, who fell from a Boat into the same Place, and was, by Means of the Ice, kept under Water for three Days, but upon his being found, appear'd full of Vi∣gour, said that he enjoy'd good Health, and af∣firm'd, that the most remarkable Circumstance of which he had been conscious was, that a large Bladder had been form'd around his Head for his Preservation.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<P>The memorable Accident which befel the <HI>Swiss Diver</HI> is so well attested, and accompanied with such a peculiar Train of Circumstances, that it cannot fail to make the most lively Impressions upon every Person capable of the smallest Degree of Reflection. As Necessity lays a Foundation for Industry, which frequently cannot be employ'd, but in a manner, which is either prejudicial to Health, or fatal to Life, so this adventurous Man follow'd the Business of plunging into the Water, and searching those Holes in which he imagined the larger and better Sort of Fishes were lodg'd. Accordingly, being employ'd as Dr. <HI>Bruhier</HI> re∣lates the Story, to furnish a Dish of Fish for a Company, who intended to regale themselves with a fine Dinner, he cheerfully undertook the Task. His Employers, in the mean Time, accompanied him to the Brink of the River, and seeing him plunge into the Water, retir'd, not in the least doubting but he would keep his Word. The <HI>Swiss,</HI> however, happening not to bring the Fish at the Hour appointed, the Company, when the Afternoon was pretty far advanc'd, went to the Banks of the River, in order to know the Rea∣son of their Disappointment. As the Clothes of the Diver lay on the River-side, so they soon su∣spected his deplorable Fate, and accordingly or∣der'd him to be search'd for with Hooks, in the Place into which they had seen him plunge. The Efforts for this Purpose were not in vain, for he was at last found, and taken out of the Water, tho' wounded in several Parts.</P>
<P>As this unfortunate Man had been under Water for nine Hours, so the Curate of the Place, whose Profession call'd for some Care of a Person in such a Situation, had a Mind that he should be forth∣with interr'd; and he had been infallibly commit∣ted
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>to the Grave, had not the celebrated Mr. <HI>Egly,</HI> a Member of the Royal Academy of <HI>Inscriptions,</HI> who observ'd a Kind of Ebullition in the Water discharg'd from his Mouth, positively affirm'd that he was not dead. For that Gentleman justly ascrib'd this Ebullition to the languid and imper∣ceptible Remains of Respiration.</P>
<P>This Conduct of Mr. <HI>Egly,</HI> however uncom∣mon, yet made so deep an Impression upon the Spectators, that they carried the unfortunate Di∣ver, into an adjacent House, where having laid him out at full Length, they compress'd his Ab∣domen, in order to procure a Discharge of the Water he had swallow'd. By this Means having in three Quarters of an Hour evacuated a consi∣derable Quantity of Water, he mov'd one of his Legs, a Circumstance which sufficiently evinc'd that he still retain'd some faint Remains of Life. For this Reason he was, by Mr. <HI>Egly</HI>'s Orders, wrap'd up in warm Sheets, and gradually reftor∣ed to a natural Heat. Then being laid in a warm Bed, and his Life becoming gradually more con∣spicuous, a liberal Venesection was made, which was succeeded by a Sigh, then by a slight Know∣ledge of what had befallen him, and soon after by a total Restitution of Health; and tho' Gratitude is rarely to be met with in the Breasts of the Vul∣gar, yet this important Service, ever after touch'd the Heart of the <HI>Swiss,</HI> with the highest and most lively Sense of the Obligations he lay under to Mr. <HI>Egly.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Durham,</HI> a Gentleman sufficiently celebrat∣ed for his untainted Integrity, and extensive Learn∣ing, in his <HI>Physico-Theology,</HI> quotes the following History from <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> an Author of no less Can∣dour and Reputation.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<P>About eighteen Years ago, a Gardner of <HI>Fron∣ningholm,</HI> now sixty-five Years old, and sufficiently vigorous and robust for a Person of that Age, made a generous Attempt to rescue an unfortu∣nate Neighbour who had fallen into the Water; but being too fool-hardy, he ventur'd upon the Ice, which broke, and let him fall into the River, which at that Part was eighteen Ells in Depth: He went perpendicularly to be Bottom, in which his Feet stuck for sixteen Hours before he was found. He himself says, that he was no sooner under Water, than he became rigid, and lost not only the Power of Motion, but also all his Senses, except that of hearing, which was affected by the Ringing of some Bells at <HI>Stockholm.</HI> He at first, also perceived a Kind of Bladder before his Mouth, which hinder'd the Ingress of the Water by that Passage tho' it enter'd freely into his Ears, and produc'd a Dulness of Hearing for some Time after. This unfortunate Man was in vain sought for during sixteen Hours, at the End of which Time he was taken up by Means of an Hook fix'd in his Head, and upon his total Recovery said, that he was sensible of that particular Part of his Fate. However, whether from the prevailing Cu∣stom of the Country, or the Persuasion of particu∣lar Persons, certain Attempts were made in order to restore him to Life: For this Purpose he was wrap'd up in Blankets, lest the Air entering too precipitately into his Lungs should prove fatal to him. In this Condition, being gradually warm'd by Means of Sheets, he was rubb'd and stimulated till the Motion of his Blood, which had been check'd for so many Hours, return'd. At last he was totally restor'd by Means of Cordials, and an∣tiapoplectic Liquors. He as yet bears the Mark of the Hook, and says, that he is still subject to vi∣olent
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>Head-achs. This singular Accident, attested by the Oaths of Persons who had been Eye-wit∣nesses to it, induc'd the Queen to give him an an∣nual Pension, and he was introduc'd to the Prince, in order to give an Account of what had befallen him.</P>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Pechlinus</HI> has wrote the History of a Woman, who remaining under Water for three whole Days, was happily restor'd to Life, almost in the same manner as the Gardner. This Fact, was so notorious, that the learned <HI>Tilasius,</HI> Libra∣ry-keeper to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and in whose Time the Woman was still alive, gave the follow∣ing Certificate of it, which is still kept in the Ar∣chives of the <HI>Acad. Natur. Curios.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There lately was in</HI> Dalia, <HI>commonly called</HI> Worms∣land, <HI>a Woman of the Name of</HI> Margaret Larsdotter, <HI>who having the Misfortune to be thrice drown'd, remain'd the first Time, she being then young, for three whole Days under Water, but the two other Times had more speedy Relief afforded her. She died in</HI> 1672, <HI>in the seventy-fifth Year of her Age.</HI> Telasius.</P>
<P>Tho' this Accident, and the Delivery from it, happening so many different Times to the same Person, may be some be look'd upon as fabulous and romantic, yet upon the whole it appears to be cloath'd with the most genuine Character of Truth and Evidence; for is it credible, that a Man of Probity, Candour, and learning, as we may rea∣dily suppose the Librarian of a rich and powerful Monarch to be, should in a manner so positive and circumstantial, dare to affirm a Fact, which was only suspect, and much less one that was abso∣lutely false? Is it probable that a Man of <HI>Pechlinus</HI>'s Character, who is no less universally than justly
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>applauded for his extensive Erudition and con∣summate medicinal Knowledge, should compose an elaborate Treatise in order to explain the Pos∣sibility of this Fact, without taking due Pains to have its Reality sufficiently confirm'd and ascer∣tain'd? or, in a word, is it to be supposed, that this Physician, who was look'd upon as the Glo∣ry and Ornament of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Nation, should have the Impudence, to appeal to all the <HI>Literati</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for the Truth of a Fact, which had not the Sanction of sufficient Evidences? Why should we be more scrupulous than <HI>Pechlinus</HI>'s con∣temporary Authors, who never call'd the Truth of this Fact in Questions? The celebrated <HI>Bartholin,</HI> in <HI>Act. Med. Haffn. Tom.</HI> 3. <HI>Obs.</HI> 42. speaks of it in the following manner; <Q>"I can by no Means remain diffident with respect to the Truth of a Story confirm'd by the concurring Testimonies of so many Witnesses of Candour and Vera∣city; and of which <HI>Pechlinus</HI> has demonstrated the Possibility by other Examples of a similar Nature: I am only surpris'd, that so singular a Narrative, should be so long buried in Oblivion, in a Nation otherwise so curious and fond of Discoveries."</Q></P>
<P>But we shall have no manner of Reason to doubt of this Fact recorded by <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> when we re∣flect, that other celebrated Physicians and Philoso∣phers, assure us of the Truth of other Accidents highly similar and analogous to it. Thus <HI>Alexan∣der Benedicius,</HI> Lib. x. Cap. 9. speaks in the fol∣lowing manner. <Q>"Life has been frequently seen restor'd to Persons who have remain'd under Water during forty-eight Hours."</Q> The same Author, for this very Reason, thinks it highly im∣proper, to inter drown'd and hysteric Patients, till seventy-two hours after their suppos'd Death.
<PB N="13" REF="15"/><HI>Borelli,</HI> in <HI>Cant.</HI> 2. <HI>Obs.</HI> 2. informs us, that, <Q>"a cer∣tain Person of Distinction having remain'd for a long Time under the Water, was taken for dead when he was found; but proper Efforts being made to restore his Life, he was rous'd from his suppos'd Death, and long surviv'd his Misfortune."</Q> Besides, the Credibility of the Fact, told by <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> is sufficiently confirm'd by the Suffrage of the learned and judicious <HI>Zac∣chias,</HI> who, in his 79th Consultation, wrote in or∣der to determine, whether the Return of Life to a young Man who had remain'd an Hour under Water, was miraculous, and as some supersti∣tious People would have it, to be ascrib'd to a Person of superior Sanctity, speaks in the follow∣ing manner. <Q>"This Event is so far from being miraculous, that it can hardly come under the Denomination of surprising, since vast Numbers of Persons have return'd to Life, after having been drown'd, or suffocated in any other man∣ner, not only for some Hours, but also during one, and even three whole Days; because the Suppression of Respiration in the Water, had occasioned an Oppression of the Spirits, and had brought on an apoplectic Paroxysm, which render'd them apparently dead, tho' their Lives were really preserv'd by Transpiration, which augmenting gradually, laid a Foundation for a free Respiration."</Q></P>
<P>The Possibility of retaining a Principle of Life for a long Time under Water, is still more sur∣prisingly confirm'd by <HI>Kunckel,</HI> in <HI>Miscellan. Nat. Curios. Decad.</HI> 3. <HI>An.</HI> 5 &amp; 6. <HI>Obs.</HI> 71. where he speaks in the following manner. <Q>"I am suffici∣ently sensible, that in <HI>Sweden,</HI> no one Doubts of the Possibility of retaining Life under Water for eight Days; and that the sollowing Accident is
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>by no Means call'd in Question by those who live near the Place where it happened. Some Time ago, about four Leagues from the Town of <HI>Falung,</HI> a Painter fell from a Boat into the Water in such a manner, as to remain upright with his Feet at the Bottom. He was in vain search'd for during eight Days; at the End of which Time, he appear'd alive on the Surface of the Water. The Magistrate and Clergyman of the Place, ask'd him the following Questions. Whether he had respir'd all the Time of his Submersion? To which he answer'd, He knew nothing of the Matter. Whether he had thought upon God and recommended his Soul to him? To which he reply'd, Very often. Whether he could see and hear? To which he answer'd, Yes, and said that he would often have laid hold of the Hooks employ'd in finding him, if he could have mov'd his Arms. He also, add∣ed, that the Fish prov'd highly offensive and uneasy to him, by the Attacks they made on his Eyes; and being ask'd by what Means he guard∣ed against these Attacks, he answer'd, by mov∣ing his Eye-lids. As to his Sense of hearing, he affirm'd, that nothing wrs more ungrateful, and even painful, to him than striking the Sur∣face of the Water; and that in a particular man∣ner, he was affected with a violent Pain of his Ears, which was forthwith communicated to his whole Body, every Time People came to draw Water in Buckets. When he was ask'd, Whe∣he had been sensible of Hunger, and discharg'd his Excrements? He reply'd, that he had not. Being interrogated, Whether he had slept? he answer'd, he knew nothing of it, but believ'd he had, because he was some time depriv'd of all Sensation and Reflection; adding, that all
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>the Thoughts he remember'd to have pass'd in his Breast, had only God, and the Means of his own Deliverance, for their Objects."</Q></P>
<P>The Nature and Circumstances of the Accident now related, lay a sufficient Foundation, for our believing the following memorable Event, espe∣cially as it happened to a Person of Distinction, and is attested as authentic by Men of Learning and Probity.</P>
<P><HI>Gocellinus,</HI> a young Man, and Nephew to one of the Archbishops of <HI>Cologne,</HI> had the Misfortune to fall into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and was not found for fifteen Days after; and being laid in an adjacent Church, in order to be interr'd, soon return'd to Life, and surviv'd the Accident a long Time.</P>
<P>As there are a great many secret Things in Na∣ture, and probably numberless latent Circumstances in the animal Oeconomy, with which we are en∣tirely unacquainted; and as Persons of a curious and attentive Turn of Mind, daily observe Acci∣dents, which they before thought impossible, so we have no Reason to doubt of surprising Facts, re∣lated by Men of Learning and Candour, nor for∣mally to deny the Truth of Events, which at first appear incredible. Of this Kind, is the following Narrative.</P>
<P>The celebrated Mr. <HI>Burmann</HI> assures us, that in <HI>Boness</HI> of <HI>Pithovia,</HI> he heard a funeral Sermon preach'd upon the Death of one <HI>Laurence Jones,</HI> a Man of seventy Years of Age, who as the Preacher said, was drown'd when sixteen Years old; and continued seven Weeks under Water, notwithstand∣ing which, he return'd to Life, and enjoy'd good Health. However visionary and romantic this Ac∣cident may appear, in the Eyes of those who pre∣tend to have divested their Minds of vulgar Er∣rors, yet it has met with Credit from the most pe∣netrating
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>and sagacious Authors who liv'd at the Time in which it happen'd. Thus the learned and judicious <HI>Langelott,</HI> in <HI>Miscellan. Natur. Curios. Decad.</HI> 1. <HI>An.</HI> 6. <HI>Obs.</HI> 20, not being able to con∣ceive how a Person can preserve a Principle of Life so long, without the Assistance of the Air, in Wa∣ters so cold and full of Nitre, as those of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and not being satisfied with similar Accidents daily happening to some Birds and Infects, is yet so far from doubting of the Truth of this Acci∣dent, that he applies to the learned Members of the <HI>Acad. Natur. Curios.</HI> for their Opinion and Explication of it; by which Means he imagin'd that effectual Measures for restoring many drown'd Persons might be discover'd. Besides, it is by no Means probable that a Man of Mr. <HI>Burmann</HI>'s Ve∣racity would forge such a Story, in order to see what enormous Lengths Credulity was capable of carrying his Fellow-Creatures; nor is it possible that the Clergyman, should, from the Pulpit, as∣sert this Fact as true, if it had not really been so, since <HI>Laurence Jones,</HI> was a Native of the Place, and well known to every one of his Audience.</P>
<P>But upon the Whole, granting that this Narra∣tive of <HI>Laurence Jones</HI> was false, which however we have no Reason to believe, yet the Recital of it has a great Tendency not only to illustrate our Subject, but also to produce happy Effects in Life; for, 1st, It is certainly the genuine and uncontro∣verted Interest of the Public, to be appriz'd of the Possibility of a Person's retaining a Principle of Life for a long Time under Water; 2dly, The Conclusion to be drawn from this seemingly mira∣culous Effect is, that if after a long Time, a Bo∣dy is taken out of the Water, without the Signs of Putrefaction, it is the Duty of those who find such a Body, to treat it as if there were still a
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>Possibility of restoring it to Life; and 3dly, If it is certain from uncontroverted Facts, that Persons have retain'd Life under Water for several Days, there is no Reason, from the Laws of the animal Oeconomy, and the hitherto known Properties of the animal Fluids, to disbelieve that the like should happen to Persons who have also remain'd under Water for several Weeks.</P>
<P>As our Modesty ought always to be propor∣tion'd to the difficult and intricate natures of the Subjects we pretend to consider, so we frankly acknowledge, that these and other similar Acci∣dents, as it were, bewilder the Mind, and perplex the most penetrating Capacities, when they attempt to account for them; since we have never yet discover'd wherein the constituent Principle of Life exactly consists, and since there are various Properties both of the Solids and Fluids of the human Body, to which we are intire Strangers. Some however, affirm, that a Principle of Life may in the deplorable State of Submersion, be re∣tain'd for a long Time, because the Coldness of the Water renders the Circulation slower, and suppersses the Transpiration of the vital Air con∣tain'd in the Blood; whilst at the same Time, some Portions of the Air lodg'd in the Water, probably penetrate into the Bodies of such Per∣sons. But <HI>Platerus</HI> and <HI>Bartholin</HI> seem to account in a more rational and satisfactory manner for Phaenomena of this Kind. The former of these Authors, in explaining how a Woman, who was drown'd in the <HI>Rhine,</HI> for murdering her own Child, return'd to Life after she was found, af∣firms, that this Accident was the Effect of a Syn∣cope, in which Respiration and the Motion of
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>the Heart are stopt. Now 'tis certain from Expe∣rience and Observation, that these two Functions may be supperess'd without the actual Loss of Life, as is frequently obvious in violent Syncopes, and hysteric Paroxysms, from which the Patients do not often recover in an Hour or more, during which Time, the slightest Indications of Life by the Pulse and Respiration, are not to be observ'd.</P>
<P>If any one should say, that it bespeaks an un∣pardonable Excess of Credulity, to believe that a Syncope may last for a Week or longer, and that consequently the Motion of the Heart and Pulse may be for that Time suspended, without neces∣sarily producing Death; we may justly reply, that hitherto no Person has discover'd wherein the Essence and Principle of Life consists; and that there are in Nature various Phaenomena, which seem to prove, that the Motion of the Heart, and the Circulation of the Humours, are rather palpable Signs of the Existence of Life, than its proximate and immediate Causes. This Doctrine we shall endeavour to establish, in a strictly ana∣logical manner, by comparing those Events which happen to Vegetables and the Brute Creation, with similar Accidents which befall Mankind.</P>
<P>For this Purpose we shall first consider the State and Condition of such Plants, as retain a Princi∣ple of Life and Vegetation during the whole Win∣ter. All the Difference, according to <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> between these, and the Plants of the animal Kind is, that in the latter the Principle of Motion is weaker, and the Texture of the Fibres less firm; whereas the former contain a much larger Quan∣tity of Oil, and have the Spirit subservient to their Vegetation repell'd by the Cold, to the Bulbs,
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>Roots, and Seeds, where it circulates in a languid manner, without having Force to propel Buds, Flowers, and Blossoms, till the kind and genial Hears of the Spring, render it more powerful and active. Why may we not, therefore, suppose that something analogous to this may happen in some human Bodies, who have been under the Water for some Time.</P>
<P>This is not the only Instance in nature, which we can bring in Confirmation of our Doctrine; for certain Insects pass the whole Winter in <HI>Chrysalides,</HI> or considerably hard Pellicules, with∣out discovering the smallest Signs of Life, tho' 'tis certain they are not dead, since a small De∣gree of Heat only, is requisite to produce their last Metamorphosis. The Reason of this apparent Death, is the Cold of the Atmosphere, so inspis∣sating their Fluids, as that they can only circulate in a faint and languid manner, round an highly minute and small Center. The Degree of Fluidi∣ty which they retain, is however, so considerable, that a more intense Cold than we perceive on the Earth, is incapable of totally coagulating them, as is sufficiently evinc'd by the curious Experi∣ments of Mr. <HI>Reaumur.</HI></P>
<P>This Phaenomenon is not only observ'd in the <HI>Chrysalides</HI> of Insects, but the <HI>Seminal Principle</HI> is also preserv'd free from Coagulation, and without discovering the smallest Sign of Life, in Eggs, which may be consider'd as the <HI>Chrysalides,</HI> or Pel∣licules of Animals whose Life is perceptible. A∣quatic Insects, also, plunge themselves into the Mud, where they remain without Motion, till the Spring; which holds equally true of Frogs and Toads, according to <HI>Valentinus,</HI> in <HI>Dissert. Epistol.</HI> 4.
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>The like happens to some terrestrial Insects; for Mr. <HI>Reaumur</HI> has by Experiment and Observa∣tion sufficiently evinc'd, that Ants during the whole Winter, remain apparently dead, till the Approach of the Spring.</P>
<P>A third and more powerful collateral Proof of this Doctrine, is drawn from the Consideration of some Animals, whole Blood is warm, and circu∣lates in the same manner with that of the Human Species; since in these also the Circulation and Respiration are suppress'd during the Winter, but return in the Spring.</P>
<P>Thus of Swallows it may be said, that during one Half of the Year they are dead, and the other alive. <HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> and <HI>Scheffer,</HI> in a Letter wrote to <HI>Hevelius,</HI> affirm, that in some northerly Countries, it is very common for Fishermen to find in the Water large Clusters of Swallows, which in the Beginning of the Autumn, had thus pil'd themselves up. Those Authors also inform us, that some Species of Swallows, spontaneously seek a Refuge in the Waters, others take their Flight to foreign Climates, others conceal them∣selves in the Holes of old and decay'd Buildings, in the Sand, and in their own Nests; and that others finding a Decay of Strength in their Pas∣sage to other Countries, plunge themselves into the Sea, where they remain till the genial Spring rouses their latent Principle of Life and Motion.</P>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Kircher,</HI> in <HI>Mund. subterran.</HI> Lib. 8. Sect. 4. informs us, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Peloponesus,</HI> and other Territories of the <HI>Archipe∣lago,</HI> have told him, that every Year, they ob∣serv'd large Quantities of Storks and Swallows flying thro' their Countries from <HI>Egypt</HI> and the
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>Coasts of <HI>Lybia,</HI> and that these latter when fatigu'd with flying, plac'd themselves, to the number of five or six, on the Back of a Stork, whom they recompens'd by an uninterrupted and melodious Song. There, are, therefore, continues the Au∣thor, some Swallows which fly from one Country to another; but 'tis equally certain from Expe∣rience, that the Swallows of cold Climates make no such Voyages; but during the Winter conceal themselves in Caves, Lakes, Rivers, Seas, and the Cavities of Trees.</P>
<P><HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> in Lib. 15. Chap. 10. informs us, that such Swallows as are taken out of the Water before the due Time, do not live long; and adds, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Tivoli,</HI> when shewing him Mount <HI>Scisso,</HI> which Name it receives from a foolish Report of its being divided at the Crucifixion of our Saviour, assur'd him, that in the Winter-Season, large Quantities of Swallows apparently dead were to be found on it; where∣as no such Animals are to be found there in Summer. He then quotes <HI>Cysatus,</HI> who in his Description of <HI>Switzerland</HI> affirms, that about <HI>Christmas,</HI> some Workmen when digging up the Earth for laying the Foundation of a public Edi∣fice, found a subterraneous Cave, from which flew about twenty or more Swallows. Whence the Au∣thor concludes, that all these Birds do not pass the Sea at their Disappearance, but that some re∣tire into the Cavities of Mountains, others in Hol∣low-Trees; but that this most frequently happens in northerly Climates.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunus Licetus,</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Feriis Altric. Animal. Disp.</HI> 19. affirms, that in upper <HI>Poland,</HI> every Person may be experimentally convinc'd, that the
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>same Swallows which in Summer build their Nests upon the Tops of Houses, towards the End of <HI>September</HI> plunge themselves into Ditches and Ri∣vers, where they remain conceal'd till about the Middle of <HI>May.</HI> He, also, informs us, that when the Inhabitants seeing Fish thro' the Ice, break it in order to catch them, they also frequently find Clusters of Swallows adhering to each other, with∣out discovering the smallest Signs of Life, till they are brought to a Stove, where they soon re∣turn to Life. But what is still more remarkable is, that as soon as the <HI>Polanders,</HI> who imagine it unlawful to kill these Swallows, set them at Li∣berty, they forthwith fly back to the Water, and plunge themselves into it.</P>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Huet,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Avranches,</HI> who travell'd thro' <HI>Sweden,</HI> informs us, that be∣tween <HI>Caen</HI> and the Sea, along the Shore of the River <HI>Orne,</HI> there are many Caves, in which, dur∣ing the Winter, have been found large Clusters of Swallows, suspended like so many Bunches of Grapes; and that the like was long ago observ'd in <HI>Italy.</HI> For <HI>Pedo Albinovanus,</HI> in the Elegy he com∣pos'd on the Death of <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> speaks of the Re∣treat of the Swallows to the Rocks, as an infalli∣ble Sign of the Approach of Winter.</P>
<Q><L>"Congelantur Aquae, scopulis se condit Hirundo,</L>
<L>"Verberat egeledas garrula vere Lacus."</L></Q>
<P><HI>Bodin,</HI> quoted by <HI>Camerarius, Cant.</HI> 7. <HI>Hist.</HI> 71. informs us, in the second Book of his <HI>Theatre of Nature,</HI> that when the People who inhabit the Coasts of the <HI>Baltic</HI> Sea, are employ'd among the Rocks in searching for yellow Amber, they fre∣quently
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>find large Clusters of Swallows. <HI>Camera∣rius</HI> subjoins, that some Authors affirm, that <Q>"Swal∣lows conceal themselves in the Bottom of the Sea, where they sleep till the Appearance of a proper Season for their quitting it; but this is impossible since they have Lungs, and for that Reason must necessarily perish in such a Con∣dition."</Q> But however specious and conclusive this Reasoning of <HI>Camerarius</HI> may appear, yet 'tis certain that the Truth of Facts, which have actual∣ly happened, can never be invalidated.</P>
<P><HI>Franciseus de Frankenau</HI> in his Medicinal Satyres, confirms this Opinion with Respect to Swallows, by the Authorities of <HI>Lauremberg,</HI> in <HI>Acer. Philol.</HI> Lib. 3. Cap. 71; of <HI>Isaac Vossius,</HI> in his <HI>Append. de Lucis Natur.</HI> Cap. 1; of <HI>Deusingius,</HI> in <HI>Vindict. Faet.</HI> Sect. 5; and of <HI>Fournier,</HI> in his Geography, who in Part 1. Lib. 2. Cap. 5. informs us, that they are commonly found in the <HI>Norwegian</HI>-Seas, as also in the Lakes and Rivers of <HI>Silesia, Po∣land, Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Moravia;</HI> and that in the Be∣ginning of the Autumn, large Numbers of them plunge themselves into Wells. The same Author, also, establishes his own Opinion by the additional Suffrages of <HI>Cromerus,</HI> in <HI>Hist. Polon,</HI> Lib. 1; of <HI>Hevelius;</HI> of <HI>Marcellus Donatus,</HI> in <HI>Hist. Med. Memorab.</HI> Lib. 4. Cap. 12. and of <HI>Helvicius,</HI> in his Epigrams.</P>
<P>The celebrated Mr. <HI>Falconet,</HI> whose Judgment and Veracity render his single Word a sufficient Evidence, informs us, that being in the House of a Gentleman of <HI>Brest</HI> in the Winter Season, he saw a Servant bring in a Kind of Mass or Lump, which appeared to be Earth, and which some Fishermen had caught in their Nets. By washing it carefully,
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>in order to discover what it was, it was found to be a Group of Swallows, which resum'd Life by being expos'd to the Fire for some time.</P>
<P>Swallows are not the only Birds which conceal themselves in the Bottoms of Rivers, in order to pass the Winter; for <HI>John Baptiste de Fulgosa,</HI> for∣merly Doge of <HI>Genoa,</HI> affirms, that <HI>Gervas Tibel∣lerius,</HI> wrote to <HI>Otho</HI> the Fourth, that some Per∣sons having thrown their Nets into a River of that Country in the Winter Time, they brought to Land a large Quantity of Storks, which were ap∣parently dead, with their Beaks fix'd in each other's Fundament; but they were soon restor'd to Life, by means of Heat. The same Author adds, that in 1467, near <HI>Metz</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> a large Number of apparently dead Storks were found in a River, and that being put into a warm Bath, they recover'd Life.</P>
<P>The learned <HI>Vossius,</HI> in <HI>Append. de Lucis Natur.</HI> informs us, that at the Approach of Winter, Storks, Herons, and some other Birds of the like Nature, do not fly to <HI>Egypt,</HI> or into more temperate Cli∣mates, but plunge themselves into Ditches and Marshes.</P>
<P>The Possibility of retaining Life for a long Time under Water, is still farther evinc'd, by considering those Birds with which our Fields and Forests are richly stock'd in Summer; but which are not to be seen in Winter. If it should be said, that these, dur∣ing the Winter, live upon the Stores they have amass'd in the Summer; I answer, that they are by no Means provident against future Want. Hence they must necessarily conceal themselves, in Places suited to their particular Natures; and as it is equally im∣possilble for them, as for the human Species, to live
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>awake without Aliments, 'tis more than probable that during the whole Winter, they are, as it were, lock'd up in so lethargic a Sleep, that they sustain no Loss or Dissipation of their Fluids, and conse∣quently require no Reparation.</P>
<P>If it should be ask'd, whether these Animals, during such a State, retain a real Principle of Life? I answer, that the Thing is not only probable, but may be also evinc'd from Fact and Experience, since the most celebrated natural Historians and Physicians give us strong and uncontroverted In∣stances of this Kind. Thus in <HI>Ephemerid. Nat. Cu∣rios.</HI> we are inform'd, that a certain Gentleman in the Winter Season, order'd an hollow Trunk of a Sallow Tree, which by his Direction had been cut down the preceding Autumn, to be laid on the Fire; but a small Portion of it happening to be left in a Corner of the Room, he had the Curiosity to examine it, and upon his doing so, found Fea∣thers arrang'd and dispos'd in a natural Manner: These he gently pluck'd off, and underneath found the Flesh of a small Bird which he believ'd to be dead, though he could not discover to what Spe∣cies it belonged. However, with respect to this Circumstance, he was soon undeceiv'd; for having expos'd it to the Influence of the Fire, it soon dis∣cover'd palpable Signs of Life. Something simi∣lar and analogous to this, no doubt, happens with respect to many of those Quadrupeds which inha∣bit our Forests, for Want of a Nourishment pro∣per to give their Blood that Degree of Fluidity, which is absolutely necessary to its Circulation, since it is certain, that a far smaller Number is to be seen in Winter than in Summer.</P>
<P>After these Examples of an apparent Death in Birds whose Blood is warm, we have no Reason to be surpriz'd at <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> when he affirms, that in
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>the Winter Time, Fishes not only appear dead, but are consequently cover'd over with a Crust of Ice in their Holes, without having the vital Prin∣ciple destroy'd in them; for they begin to live a∣fresh, when the Heat of the Atmosphere, or an artificial Fire, melts the Ice. The like, continues the Author, happens to Serpents, Toads, Frogs, Tortoi∣ses, and in a Word all amphibious Animals, when the Cold inspissates their Juices; which being naturally viscid, are consequently more proper to prevent the Dissipation of that vital Spirit, which is abso∣lutely necessary to restore them to Life.</P>
<P>'Tis to be observ'd, that those Fishes which have been thus frozen, do not long survive their artificial Restitution to Life; because the Frost having al∣ter'd the Principles of their Blood, the vital Spirit, when beginning to act and unfold itself, can no longer form a Mass of Fluids of an uniform Na∣ture. Thus Wine when frozen, and artificially thaw'd, contracts a disagreeable Flavour, because the Solution being procur'd in an unnatural Man∣ner, hinders the spirituous Part of the Wine from mixing with its other Principles, in the same Or∣der and Proportion as before.</P>
<P>What <HI>Pechlinus</HI> advances with Respect to Fishes, is entirely conformable to the Opinion of <HI>Theo∣phrastus,</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Piscibus in siceo degeritibus,</HI> where we are inform'd, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Pontus,</HI> frequently find Fishes in the Ice, which discover no Signs either of Motion or Sensation, till they are put into a Fish-Back, or laid among Straw. This Circumstance, according to <HI>Theophrastus,</HI> happens particularly to the Gudgeon, and some other Fishes of a similar Nature.</P>
<P>The last Proof of the Possibility of a Person's retaining a Principle of Life for a long Time under Water, without a Supply of Aliments for the
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>Purposes of Nutrition, is drawn from a Considera∣tion of some Quadaupeds, as the Hedge-Hog, the Marmotte, the Dormouse, and some others, which in the Beginning of Winter concealing themselves in the Earth, are seiz'd with so pro∣found a Sleep that they appear to be dead, since neither the Pulsation of their Arteries, nor their Respiration are perceptible. This Circumstance, no doubt, induc'd the celebrated <HI>Harvey</HI> in <HI>Lib. de Generat. Animal. Exercit.</HI> 50▪ to speak in the following Manner: <Q>"Some sanguineous Animals live long without any Pulse, and lie conceal'd during the Whole of the Winter, notwithstand∣ing which they remain alive, tho' their Heart retains no Motion, and their Respiration stops, just as it happens to Persons attack'd with Sin∣copes, and hysteric Fits, whose Pulse is totally a∣bolish'd."</Q> Tho' <HI>Harvey</HI> was the glorious Dis∣coverer of the Circulation of the Blood, and may for that Reason be suppos'd to be a keen Advo∣cate in its Behalf, yet 'tis sufficiently obvious from this Passage, that he did not believe it absolutely necessary to the Preservation of Life. But <HI>Pechli∣nus,</HI> whether from Prejudice, or rational Deducti∣ons from what he had observ'd, is of Opinion, that in these Animals, Respiration is carried on, by a Motion of the Diaphragm, so insensible as to escape the Eye of the Observer. He also observes, that in this State, it is necessary their Respiration should be such, because if it was perform'd in the usual Manner, the Motion of the Blood would be so likewise; in consequence of which, the Trans∣piration and Necessity for Aliments would be e∣qually strong; a Circumstance incompatible with the Condition of these Animals, which lie hid un∣der the Earth during the whole Winter.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
<P>Tho' these Relations may possibly appear very singular and surprising to Persons unacquainted with Natural History; yet they infallibly prove, that in the brute Creation at least, Respiration, the Circulation of the Blood, and Pulsation of the Ar∣teries may cease for a long Time, without the total Extinction and Destruction of Life. Now is it not highly probable, or rather absolutely certain, that something similar and analogous to this may happen to human Creatures, who have the Misfor∣tune to be drown'd, since in both, the Solids and Fluids act and move by the same Laws, so in both Suffocation must be the same Thing, and conse∣quently its Effects remov'd by the same Means?</P>
<P>Besides, there is by no Means any Reason for believing, that an Instance of this surprsing Absti∣nence and Want of Food, prodnc'd by such a pro∣found and lethargic Sleep, as that of the Marmotte, is not to be found among the human Species; for in <HI>Miscellan. Academ. Natur. Curios. An.</HI> 8. <HI>Obs.</HI> 67. the celebrated <HI>Ludovicus,</HI> first Physician to the Duke of <HI>Saxe-Gotha</HI> informs us, that a young Girl, who for some Fault she had committed being ap∣prehensive of a severe Chastisement from her Pa∣rents, retir'd to the most conceal'd Part of a Thicket, where, seven Days after her Elopement, she was found lying on her Belly with all the ap∣parent Signs of Death, except that her Limbs were still flexible and pliant; her Visage was overspread with a viscid Phlegm, which was co∣ver'd with an hoary Kind of Down, and with the falling Leaves which had adher'd to it. Her Mouth and Nostrils were entirely full of a thick Mucus: But notwithstanding these seemingly dis∣couraging Circumstances, the Physician call'd to her Assistance, order'd her Body to be warm'd by Means of Friction; Then, with warm Water,
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>washing away the Phlegm which cover'd her Face, and the viscid Mucus which obstructed her Mouth and Nostrils, he pour'd into her Mouth a Spoon∣ful of Brandy, which seem'd to go down her Throat, and was the only Cordial he had at hand. Upon exhibiting a second Spoonful, she fetch'd a Sigh, and a third made her open her Eyes.</P>
<P>We now proceed, to consider the most proper and efficacious Measure to be taken for the Relief of drown'd Persons; for which Purpose we shall previously investigate and ascertain the genuine Cause of Suffocation.</P>
<P>Not only the antient Schools of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Ara∣bia,</HI> but also most of the succeeding Physicians, till the Days of <HI>Platerus,</HI> imagin'd that the Suffo∣cation was produc'd by the Water which enter'd into the Stomach, Breast, and Lungs; in Conse∣quence of which false Notion they thought them∣selves fully authoriz'd to attempt its Discharge with all possible Expedition. For this Purpose they order'd drown'd Persons to be suspended by the Feet, or laid upon their Bellies, on a Hogshead or Tub, which was to be agitated from one Side to the other, imagining that by this Position, the Abdomen and Breast being compress'd, and the Head hanging down, the Agitation of the Vessel, must necessarily facilitate the Evacuation of the Water, which they suppos'd was also fa∣vour'd by the declining Situation of the superior Part of the Body. With the same Intention, they also order'd such Measures as had a Tendency to excite Vomiting.</P>
<P>But as a false Theory never fails to lay a Foun∣dation for a dangerous Practice, so we have just Reason to condemn this Method of Suspension, or hanging by the Heels; for the Water swallow'd by drowning Persons descends into the Stomach,
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>and not into the Thorax, so that it cannot prevent their Recovery. This Circumstance must happen, not only so long as a Person retains a Sense of his State and Condition, but also afterwards; for as the Water is hinder'd from entring into the Arte∣ria Trachaea and Lungs by a mechanical Effort, in which Reason has no share, so the Lungs may in this State be compar'd to an empty Bottle plung'd in Water, into which the Fluid does not enter, be∣cause the Air it contains resists its Access, and this the rather happens, because the Motion of the Breast, destin'd to attract the Air, at that Time, totally ceases, and consequently nothing forces the Water to enter and fill up its Place. This Doc∣trine is not only evinc'd from the Structure of the Parts, but also confirm'd by Experience.</P>
<P>Thus the learned <HI>Platerus,</HI> in <HI>Quest.</HI> 5. positive∣ly affirms, that if drown'd Persons swallow any Water, the Quantity of it is too small to prove mortal to them; because he always found but ve∣ry little of it in their Stomachs. He also adds, that most of the Water which appears to be dis∣charg'd from the Mouths of Persons suspended by the Heels, really flow'd from their Cloaths.</P>
<P><HI>Nymman,</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Vita foet. in Utero,</HI> speaks thus, <Q>"Who could believe that a Foetus so long included in the Uterus, where it moves all its Limbs, should yet never move its Jaw-bone, nor open its Mouth. Besides, it always has its Nostrils open, notwithstanding which it has ne∣ver been observ'd that the Liquor of the Am∣nios has enter'd its Body. Thus it is with the Human Foetus, as with those who are drown'd, since in dissecting many of these last, I have hardly found a Pint of Water in their Bodies."</Q></P>
<P>In the <HI>Miscellan. Nat. Curios. An.</HI> 2. <HI>Obs.</HI> 251. <HI>Wepfer,</HI> gives an Account of the Anatomy of
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>some Beavers, one of which was drown'd. The Author having open'd the <HI>Arteria Trachaea,</HI> no Water was discharg'd from the Lungs; but there were about four Ounces of Water, like the Wash∣ings of Flesh, found in the right Cavity of the Breast, and about three Ounces of the same Kind in the Left. This Extravasation the Author just∣ly supposes produc'd by the Expression of a bloody Lymph from the Pores of the Bronchia of this Animal, which had for a long Time struggled a∣gainst so violent a Death as that of Drowning. Neither pure Water nor Water ting'd with Blood, were observ'd either in the <HI>Arteria Trachaea,</HI> or in the <HI>Bronchia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bhonius,</HI> in the Appendix to his Treatise <HI>de Re∣nuntiat. Vuln. Diss.</HI> 2. informs us, that in dissect∣ing a great many Women drown'd for murdering their Children, he had shewn the Spectators, that there was little or no Water in their Lungs and Abdomen; and adds, that in order to render him∣self more certain with Respect to this Circumstance, he had, drown'd several Animals, in whose Cavities, tho' drown'd alive, he had never perceiv'd any Water.</P>
<P><HI>Dethardingius,</HI> at present Professor of Medicine in <HI>Coppenhagen,</HI> in a Letter wrote when he was Professor at <HI>Rostoch,</HI> in 1714, gives us an Account of the Dissection of a Soldier, who attempting to make his Escape from a Garrison, was drown'd in a Ditch, and upon being open'd had in his Sto∣mach only about a Pint of Beer, which he had drank some Time before. The Professor took care previously to apprise the Spectators, that there would not be a single Drop of Water in his Breast, which as well as his Abdomen, was very much elevated; and the Event verified the Pre∣diction.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
<P><HI>Johannes Conradus Becker,</HI> in his Treatise <HI>de Submers. Mort. Sin. Pot. Aq.</HI> gives us the four following Histories. A Dog, says he, being drown'd and lying in the Water for an Hour, his Abdomen, Stomach, and Intestines, appear'd tu∣mified and inflated, tho' a single Drop of Water was not found in them. The Lungs were, also, inflated, without containing Water, like those of hang'd Persons, but immediately collaps'd upon suffering the Air to escape thro' an Incision made in the <HI>Arteria Traehaea.</HI> The Author subjoins, that this Observation render'd the Doctrine of the An∣tients highly suspected by him.</P>
<P>The second, is the History of a Peasant, taken from the Water, after he had been some Weeks in it, and was entirely putrified. After opening his Duodenum, two Ligatures were made on that In∣testine, which was very much inflated, and from the Aperture of which nothing was discharg'd, but a Liquor which was Chyle mix'd with Beer, of which the Peasant had, at a Market, drank so li∣berally, as to intoxicate himself. The Tumefacti∣on of the Stomach, laid a Foundation for suspect∣ing that it contain'd a large Quantity of Water, tho' upon laying it open, nothing was found but a Pint of a Liquor, whose Smell exactly resem∣bled that of Beer. The Lungs were so much in∣flated, that when an Incision was made in the Breast, they burst out; but their Inflation was speedily dis∣sipated, by making an Aperture in the <HI>Arteria Trachea,</HI> thro' which the Air was discharg'd with a considerable Noise. In cutting the Lungs into Pieces, no extraordinary Signs of Humidity were perceiv'd, nor were any preternatural Circum∣stances observ'd, except Spots of different Colours.</P>
<P>The third History, is that of a Woman drown'd in a Well, in whose Intestines nothing but Chyle
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>was discover'd, neither was there any Water in the Lungs. The Intestines collaps'd upon making a small Puncture in them, and an Aperture being made in the Arteria Trachea, the Air escap'd thro' it from the Lungs with some Noise.</P>
<P>The fourth and last History related by <HI>Becker,</HI> is that of a Man who was found standing upright in a Bason, where he had remain'd under Water for five Days. His Stomach, which was large, was only inflated with Wind, and hardly contain'd six Ounces of a whitish Liquor. The Lungs being equally inflated, collaps'd upon cutting the Arteria Trachea, from which the Air was discharg'd with a considerable Noise. When he was found, two Spoonfuls of Water were not discharg'd from his Mouth. <Q>"He was, however, continues <HI>Becker,</HI> every where surrounded with Water, but that Element, notwithstanding the Minuteness of its Parts, could not penetrate into the Arte∣ria Trachea and Oesophagus, in order to fill the Cavities of the Viscera; an evident Proof that these Parts were so defended against every Thing that made an Attempt to enter them, that the Water itself could not force a Passage into them."</Q></P>
<P>From these Observations, the celebrated Author concludes, that the Absence of Water in the Lungs and Intestines, is not a Proof that a Person has been thrown into the Water after his Death. This Observation is of the last Importance to those whose Business it is to make Reports before Courts of Ju∣dicature, tho' it is contrary to that of <HI>Rodericus à Castro,</HI> adopted by many Philologists and Crimi∣nalists, and among others by <HI>Feltman</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Ca∣davero inspiciendo,</HI> Cap. 21. But as in the Opinion of <HI>Becker,</HI> the Lungs are not inflated in those who are thrown into the Water after Death, so we may
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>from their Inflation draw a Proof, that the Person was alive when drown'd, or put into the Water.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, it is sufficiently obvious, both from the Structure of the Parts, and the Authori∣ties of the most penetrating Anatomists, that little or no Water enters the Bodies of drown'd Persons, so 'tis equally obvious, that the Practice of hang∣ing by the Heels, is not only useless, but must also contribute to destroy those Remains of Life which may possibly be lost; for by such a Suspension, the whole Column of the Blood convey'd to the Heart by the inferior <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> will necessarily press upon that convey'd by the superior <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> where the Blood being interrupted in its Course, must neces∣sarily regurgitate into the jugular Veins, and conse∣quently into the Head, where, by its Quantity and Weight, it retards the Motion of the Spirits, whose free Progress is absolutely necessary to restore the Cir∣culation of the Blood, on which Life in a great Measure depends.</P>
<P>As it is of great Importance, to know the Cause of the Inflation of drown'd Persons, since it is not produc'd by the Water they swallow, so the learn∣ed <HI>Dethardingius</HI> accounts for it in the following manner, <Q>"Those, says he, who die in the Water, are not destroy'd for Want of Air, but by means of too large a Quantity of it; they do not die in Expiration, but in Inspiration; and in a Word, nothing more resembles each In∣spiration, than the Phaenomena observ'd in drown'd Persons; for if we attentively consider what happens to ourselves, we perceive that the Breast is as it were lengthen'd, the Abdomen elevated, and the Flanks inflated, and that this State subsists, so long as we draw in the Air, or retain it in the Breast. Now the same Things happen in drown'd Persons, only with this Dif∣ference,
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>that in the latter, the Inspiration is perform'd with Rapidity and Violence, whereas in the former it is carried on quietly and without any Effort. In Persons not drown'd, a Depres∣sion succeeds the Elevation; but in drown'd Persons the Elevation of the Abdomen, and the Elongation of the Breast subsist; by which means, all the Parts continue in a State of Expansion. This is, no doubt, the Meaning of those, who look upon the Death of drown'd Persons as a Suffocation, and pretend that the Cause of it, and that of strangled Persons is the same; for those two Kinds of Death have a great Resem∣blance and Analogy, as is sufficiently obvious from the Elevation of the Abdomen, which in hang'd Persons subsists after their Death."</Q></P>
<P>From this Theory 'tis sufficiently easy to con∣ceive, that the Inflation of the Lungs, is the Cause of the Death of drown'd Persons; accordingly <HI>Dethardingius</HI> from the preceding Doctrine draws the following Conclusions; <Q>"The Vesicules of the Lungs are inflated by the Air, the Bronchia are lengthen'd, the Blood Vessels distributed thro' the whole Body of the Lungs, are com∣press'd; and tho' the Elongation of the Bron∣chia assists the Entry of the Blood into the large Vessels, as well those proper to the Lungs, as the bronchial Artery and Vein, as those which are only subservient to the Circulation, as the pulmonary Artery and Vein, yet the Circulation is not carried on equally in the Capillaries; since the Presence of a rarified Air in the Vesicules compresses the Blood, and forcing it to stop there, hinders it from passing into the Left Ven∣tricle of the Heart, in order to accomplish the Circulation. Now as soon as there is a consi∣derable Retardation in this important Function,
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>the vital Motions also gradually cease, and Death approaches insensibly."</Q></P>
<P>After having thus discover'd the Reason of the Inflation of the Lungs, and of the Death which succeeds that Circumstance, we shall, with the same Author, investigate the Cause which hinders the Discharge of the Air from the Lungs and Breast. This is by no means a Topic of pure Cu∣riosity, since, the Assistance to be afforded to drown'd Persons▪ can be of no Service, except in so far as it is proper to remove those Obstacles, which oppose and hinder the respective Actions of the viral Functions. Now <HI>Dethardingius</HI> and <HI>Becker</HI> pretend, that the <HI>Epiglottis,</HI> (which is a small Valve plac'd at the external Entrance of the Larynx, in order by its covering the Glottis, to hinder all solid or liquid Bodies which may be put into the Mouth, from descending into the Canal of Respiration) being exactly and strongly applied over the Glottis, proves the Obstacle to the Discharge of the Air from the Lungs. These Authors, also, affirm that such a strong and convulsive Application of the Epiglottis over the Glottis, arises from a pre∣ternatural Extension of the Fibres of those Mem∣branes of the Larinx, which cover the Epiglottis. This preternatural Extension they attribute to the violent Inspiration excited by Fear, in Persons who run a Risk of being drown'd. Thus the incom∣parable <HI>Dethardingius</HI> reasons in the following Manner: <Q>"If in all Kinds of Dread and Terror we observe, that Respiration is disorder'd; that is to say, that Inspiration is more quick, and lasts longer; and that, on the contrary, Expiration is intercepted, uncertain, and short, it follows of Course, that Inspiration must be much more strong, and the Air attracted in a far larger Quantity, when a Person perceives that he is
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>threatn'd with Death by the Water, which must in a Moment fill the Space which ought to be occupied by the Air."</Q></P>
<P>It is pretty surprising that <HI>Becker</HI> and <HI>Dethar∣dingius</HI> should only reason conjecturally in this Af∣fair; since the Dissections they made of drown'd Persons, might have enabled them by their Eyes to judge of the Disposition of the <HI>Epiglottis</HI> in these unfortunate Creatures. But, be this as it will; certain it is that <HI>Dethardingius</HI>'s Method of afford∣ing Relief to drown'd Persons, is highly rational, and promises fair for restoring them to Life. It consists in four Things; the first of which is, to place the Body drawn from the Water in a proper Posture and Situation. The Second is to compress the Abdomen, at the same Time that Frictions are making on the Back. The Third is, to excite an Irritation in the Throat; and the Fourth to make an Incision in the <HI>Arteria Trachea.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Situation of the Person taken from the Water, we have already shewn Suspension by the Heels to be prejudicial; tho' <HI>Becker</HI> recommends it, because he thinks the Weight of the abdominal Vi∣scera may thrust the Diaphragm into the Breast, com∣press the Lungs, and giving a greater Spring to the Air, make it act with such an Effort, as to raise the <HI>Epiglottis:</HI> But the judicious <HI>Dethardingius,</HI> sen∣sible that this Method is sufficient to destroy Re∣spiration in Persons alive, absolutely condemns it, and orders drown'd People to be laid with their Bodies so declining, as that the Head may be lowest. Besides, as he had observ'd that Respira∣tion is more difficultly perform'd on the Belly, he directs drown'd Persons to be laid on their Backs, and a strong Compression of the Abdomen to be made, from the Region of the Pubes, as far up as
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>the Stomach. He adds, that it is expedient, both for the Sake of the Frictions and the Compression, to rub the Hands with some Oil, proper to restore to the Fibres render'd rigid by the Cold and Spasms, that Suppleness and pliant State, which is necessary to them in order to perform the Mo∣tions of Respiration.</P>
<P><HI>Pechlinus</HI> observes, that in <HI>Sweden</HI> it is customa∣ry to use Frictions on Persons taken out of the Water, and externally to apply hot and spirituous Remedies in order to reanimate the internal Heat, and more effectually excite the Effervescence of the Blood. <HI>Borelli,</HI> in <HI>Hist. Cent.</HI> 2. <HI>Obs.</HI> 11. or∣ders the Skin to be render'd red by Means of Frictions in a warm Bed. Mr. <HI>Joly,</HI> a Physi∣cian of <HI>Britany,</HI> in the Observations inserted in the Historical Journal, for the Month of <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> 1743, advises Frictions before a large Fire with hot Cloths, with a View to restore the Per∣son to Heat as soon as possible. <HI>Dethardingius</HI> or∣ders these Frictions to be made from the Nape of the Neck down to the Buttocks, because, the Heads of the Muscles subservient to Expiration, are attach'd to the Spine of the Back, and their Tendors to the Ribs; and because, in his Opinion, Friction facilitates the Action of these Muscles, especially when made with Oils, which contribute to restore the Plyancy of the Fibres.</P>
<P>Besides Frictions before a Fire, with hot Cloths soak'd in Oils or spirituous Liquors, are beneficial in another Respect, because, the Spine of the Back is the Origin of a great Number of Nerves and consequently of the various Motions perform'd in the Body. This cannot fail to put all the vital Springs in Action; by restoring Suppleness to the nervous and muscular Fibres, and Motion to the
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>flow circulating, or even totally coagulated Juices, This is the Reason, why Frictions and Pumping so often prove successful in Apoplexies.</P>
<P>We must, also, observe, that <HI>Dethardingius,</HI> approves of laying drown'd Persons on their Bel∣lies over a Hogshead, or round Vessel, which is to be agitated, not with a View to make them dis∣charge the Water they have swallow'd, but to shake and compress the Abdomen, and thrust its Contents towards the Diaphragm. But <HI>Forestus,</HI> in <HI>Observat. Chirurg.</HI> Lib. 6. <HI>Obs.</HI> 33. <HI>&amp; Obs. Med.</HI> Lib. 15. <HI>Obs.</HI> 26. condemns this Expedient as well as that of Hanging by the Heels, <Q>"because, says he, it has produced sudden Death in some Per∣sons who could not bear the violent Motion, the Turning, the internal Parts of the Body topsy-turvy, and the Agitation of the Head, and Vomiting produc'd by this Means."</Q> Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> also condemns the putting drown'd Persons in a Hogshead open at both Ends in order to be roll'd for some Time in different Directions.</P>
<P><HI>Dethardingius</HI> seems not to have laid great Stress upon the <HI>Swedish</HI> Practice of defending the Bodies of drown'd Persons from the Contact of the Air, and of conveying them into warm Places. The first Step however taken by the <HI>Swedes</HI> is, accord∣ing to <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> to wrap such Bodies up in warm Cloths. <HI>Langelotti</HI> also, in <HI>Miscel. Nat. Curios. An.</HI> 6. <HI>Obs.</HI> 20. informs us, that this Method is a∣mong them universally put in Practice, because they have learn'd from long Experience, that no drown'd Person recovers, if he is left long, ex∣pos'd to the free Air, Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> is, also, of Opi∣nion, that drown'd Persons should be left upon the Shore no longer, than is necessary to pull off their Cloths, which may be cut off for the Sake of Expedition; <Q>"for, continues he, a single Moment
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>often determines between a State of Death or Life."</Q> In consequence of this Principle, he adopts the <HI>Swedish</HI> Practice; <Q>"for, <HI>says he,</HI> when the drown'd Person's Cloths are taken off, he is to be wrapt up in the warmest Coverings or Cloths which can be then had. Then he is to be convey'd to the nearest House, where after Frictions before a warm Fire with hot Cloths, he is to be laid in a very warm Bed. Great Care is to be taken, to apply to his Feet, the Inner-sides of his Thighs, his Houghs, and his Arm-Pits, Flaggons full of boiling Water, wrapt up in linen Cloths."</Q> For the same Pur∣pose we may make use of Bricks. I must, how∣ever, observe, that Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> recedes from the <HI>Swedish</HI> Practice, in a Circumstance which to me appears to be of the least Importance; for the <HI>Swedes</HI> do not warm the Bodies of drown'd Per∣sons suddenly, but by little and little, before a gentle Fire. The Expedience of this may be e∣vinc'd by considering the Effects of a too intense Heat upon Fishes found frozen in the Winter Time, which indeed recover for a Moment, and then die irretriveably. <HI>Nymman</HI> and <HI>Ranchin</HI> also order'd drown'd Persons to be laid in warm Places, especially in Winter.</P>
<P>As in drown'd Persons, a Defect of respirable Air produces a Suffocation, so it would be no less foolish, than barbarous, suddenly to expose them to the entire Action of the Atmosphere, since that Fluid entering precipitately into the Thorax, would produce, in the pulmonary Vessels, a Dila∣tation, which instead of promoting the Passage of the Blood thro' that Organ, would produce a fresh Obstruction in it, because the Action of the Heart is not strong enough, to surmount the Re∣sistance which the Air makes to the Passage of the
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>Blood; and this must the more inevitably happen, because the Lungs in such a State collapse, which is the unavoidable Fate of all Fibres de∣priv'd of the Influx of the Animal Spirits, which necessarily depends on the free Conveyance of the Blood thro' the whole Body, and the Velocity of its circular Motion. The Precaution, therefore, of wrapping Persons taken from the Water in Blankets, is highly proper, and excellently suited not only to this Species of Suffocation, but also of all others.</P>
<P>But it is not sufficient to guard drown'd Persons against the rude Impressions of the Atmosphere, since 'tis also requisite they should only be per∣mitted the free Use of that Fluid by Degrees.</P>
<P>As the Decrease of the Circulation is necessarily succeeded by a proportionable Diminution of Heat, so 'tis justly to be expected, that the Bodies of drown'd Persons have lost the greatest Part of that Warmth, which is so necessary to the Support of Life. Hence 'tis absolutely requisite they should be warm'd. But it would be equally pernicious, suddenly to expose them at once to the Fire, or precipitately to exhibit Medicines, which by the Volatility of their Principles, might produce a Rarefaction of the Blood. 'Tis, therefore, far more safe and prudent, to begin with gradually augmented Frictions of the Extremities with warm Cloths, than all at once to expose such Persons to the Fire, or call in the Assistance of hot and vo∣latile Medicines, both of which may be safely, tho' sparingly and gradually us'd, when the Circula∣tion is so restor'd, that their bad Effects are no longer to be fear'd,</P>
<P>These Precautions are founded on physical Rea∣sons, which tho' sufficiently known to Physicians,
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>may yet afford fresh Pleasure and Entertainment to Readers of another Class.</P>
<P>The Blood, then, of the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> discharges itself into the right Auricle of the Heart, whose Contraction forces it into the right Ventricle, which in its Turn contracting itself, propels the Blood into the Pulmonary Artery. That those Opera∣tions may be perform'd, 'tis necessary the Quanti∣ty of Blood discharg'd into the right Auricle, should not over-power its Action; that the con∣tractile Force of the right Ventricle should be suf∣ficient to propel the Blood in the pulmonary Ar∣tery; and that in this Artery there should be no∣thing to obstruct or oppose the Distribution of the Blood, which ought to be made in it. Now according to this Theory, the Contractions of the right Auricle and Ventricle, are in such Cases ex∣tremely weakened, since these Muscles partake of the Relaxation of the whole System of the Fibres. The Lungs, also, collapse, and consequently op∣pose the free Circulation of the Blood, or its free Distribution thro' themselves. If, therefore, in affording Assistance to drown'd Persons, we should precipitately convey too quick a Motion to the Blood, we should by that very Circumstance pro∣duce invincible Obstacles to its Circulation, and consequently make the Means of recalling Life subservient to the Production of irretreivable Death; for the excessive Quantity of Blood which enters the right Auricle, will over-power and sur∣mount the weak Force which resists it. Besides, tho' this Auricle had contractile Force enough to convey the Blood into the Heart, yet the Action of that Muscle will not be sufficient to propel the Blood into the Lungs, or at least to surmount the joint Resistance made by the collapsed State of the Lungs, and the Air compressing their Blood-Vessels.
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>These Methods, therefore, of relieving drown'd Persons and restoring them to Life, are not only founded upon the animal Oeconomy, but are also absolutely necessary and indispensible.</P>
<P>'Tis, however, to be observ'd, that when the Circulation begins to be carried on freely, we may, if such Practice is indicated by any pressing Cir∣cumstances, attempt to reduce it to its natural State, by means of Cordials and anti-apoplectic Medicines; tho' these, especially the latter, as being most powerful, are in the Beginning to be us'd with the utmost Caution; and probably the safest Method is totally to abstain from the anti-apoplectic Medicines, and to begin with the mildest Cordials, whose most energetic Parts being diluted in a large Quantity of some proper Vehicle, may more insensibly mix themselves with the Mass of Blood, and consequently produce their Effects more slowly. 'Tis, however, to be observ'd, that the same Danger is not to be dreaded from the ex∣ternal Use of the most efficacious Remedies. Thus, for Instance, we need not hesitate to apply Topics to the Temples, the Nostrils, the Wrists, the Pit of the Stomach, and all those Parts, where the Ar∣teries lying near the Surface of the Body, are ex∣pos'd to their Action and Influence. And as the Membranous Parts are none of the least considera∣ble Instruments of the several Motions perform'd in the Body, so a very particular Regard ought to be had to them: Frictions, then, of the Hands and Feet, as well as the Application of spirituous Medicines to these Parts, are extremely beneficial; for tho' the Propriety of this Practice could not be demonstrated from Anatomy and Physiology, yet we might be fully convinc'd of it, by the Obser∣vation of <HI>Deventer,</HI> who orders Frictions with Brushes to be made on the Soles of the Feet of
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>such new-born Children, as discover no Signs of Life, in order to restore the Circulation of the Blood, which is the Foundation or first Beginning of it.</P>
<P><HI>Deventer</HI> does not, indeed, advise the Applica∣tion of spirituous Medicines to these Parts; but as 'tis sufficiently certain, that these, as well as all other Liquors, penetrate the Surface of the Body, and enter the Cavities of the Vessels, so their ex∣ternal Applications must necessarily produce very happy Effects. Besides, this Method of using spirituous Medicines, is of all others the safest; not only because their Mixture with the Blood is not so quick as when they are exhibited internally, but also, because, the Parts to which they are ap∣plied are most remote from the Center.</P>
<P>But we now proceed to consider the other Me∣thods of affording Relief to drown'd Persons, be∣ginning with the Smoke of Tobacco, the happy Ef∣fects of which are prov'd by various Observations. Thus Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> in his mechanical Account of Poisons, after mentioning that many who have been drown'd and dead to all Appearance, have been surprisingly restor'd to Life, speaks in the fol∣lowing manner, from the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences: <Q>"This Circumstance should certainly encourage the Use of all Means, upon such Accidents, especially as the Trial is not dif∣ficult. The first Step should be to blow the Smoke of Tobacco up into the Intestines, then to warm the Body by shaking and rolling about, and rub∣bing it with warm Cloths in a Bed. In a Word to put the Blood into Motion all manner of Ways, and not to be discourag'd tho' no Signs of Life should be discover'd after an Hour or two should be spent in this good Work; towards the latter End of which, Spirits and volatile Salts may produce a good Effect. Neither
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>should bleeding be omitted when the Blood is become sufficiently warm to drop out of the Veins."</Q></P>
<P>The happy Effects of the Smoke of Tobacco in restoring drown'd Persons to Life, are farther evinc'd from the following Narration of Dr. <HI>Bru∣hier.</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> a profess'd Surgeon of <HI>Paris,</HI> being at <HI>Passy,</HI> waited in a Boat till the Number it was to take in should be completed. During this Time, he saw a Boat crossing the River, and when it arriv'd at Land, one of the Passengers stepping ashore, and missing his Wife, ask'd what was become of her; but no one could give him any Answer, except a young Child, who pointing to the River, said, she had hid herself in it. This Wo∣man had fallen from the Stern of the Boat, without being perceiv'd by any of the Passengers, except the Child, who gave Directions to row to the very Part where the Woman fell from the Boat. The Husband finding her in a Place which was not very deep, but full of Mud, brought her to Land, and laid her out. Whilst some of the Spectators of this melancholy Accident were advising to hang her by the Heels, and others ordering different Mea∣sures to be taken, a Soldier with his Pipe in his Mouth, came to ask the Reason of such a Concourse of People; upon being inform'd of the Accident, he desir'd the disconsolate Husband to give over weeping, because his Wife would re∣turn to Life very soon. Then giving his Pipe to the Husband, he bid him introduce the small End of it into the Anus, put a Piece of Paper perforated with a large Number of Holes upon its Mouth, and thro' that blow the Smoke of the Tobacco into her Interstines, as strongly as he possibly could. Ac∣cordingly at the fifth Blast, a considerable rum∣bling in the Woman's Abdomen was heard, upon
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>which she discharg'd some Water from her Mouth' and in a Moment after return'd to Life. This Practice, however insignificant in the Eyes of the Vulgar, is nevertheless of the highest Importance; for the Irritation of the Intestines, excited by the Heat and Acrimony of the Smoke of the Tobacco, produces in the Muscles subservient to Expiration, such a Reflux of the animal Spirits, as induces a Con∣traction of them sufficient to surmount that Re∣sistance which the Air contain'd in the Breast, found to its Discharge. This happy Effect of the Smoke of Tobacco is sufficiently evinc'd by the preceding History, since it made the Woman vo∣mit up the Water she had swallow'd. Now vo∣miting is excited by a stimulating Contraction of the Diaphragm, and of the transverse Muscle of the Abdomen, which contracting the Stomach, force it to discharge its Contents, where the least Resistance is found, and consequently by its supe∣rior Orifice. It is to be observ'd, that the same happy Effects are produc'd by the Smoke of all acrid Substances, since Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> affirms, that the same End is equally answer'd by the Smoke of Sage, and other Plants of a similar Nature. It is also highly probable, that Clysters prepar'd with Coloquintida or Tobacco, would produce Effects e∣qually good; but on such Occasions, the most rea∣dy and expeditious Measures are always to be taken, since a very small Delay may prove of the last Consequence, by destroying a Life which might otherwise be preserv'd.</P>
<P>In Cases of Emergence, where proper Instru∣ments are not immediately to be procur'd, the Pre∣scription of the Soldier in the preceding History, may be follow'd; but it may lose less Time to co∣ver the Tobacco in the Bole of the Pipe, when lighted, with a silk Handkerchief, either single,
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>or once doubled, than to wait till proper Holes are bor'd in a Piece of Paper, tho' this takes up very little Time. However, that no necessary Instruc∣tions might be wanted, I have given the Figure of an Instrument; contriv'd on purpose for impelling the Smoke of Tobacco into the Intestines. A. re∣presents a Brass or Iron Box, capable of containing half an Ounce of the strongest Tobacco, which is to be lighted. B. is a common Clyster Pipe, to be introduc'd into the <HI>Anus,</HI> join'd to the flexible Tube D. D. made of Leather. C. is another Pipe, at which a Person blows forcibly, that the Smoke of the Tobacco in the Box A. may be impell'd thro' the flexible Tube D. D. and the Pipe B. into the In∣testines. E. represents the Smoke. If one Cly∣ster is not sufficient, another should be given soon after, and repeated till it answers.</P>
<P>These Clysters of the Fume of Tobacco, are of excellent Use in the Iliac Passion, and in an incarce∣rated Hernia; and no Apothecary or Surgeon ought to be without such an Instrument.</P>
<P>As the olfactory Nerves are of all others the most expos'd to the Action of Bodies, and have an intimate Connection with those subservient to the Motion of the Muscles destin'd for Respiration, it must of course be beneficial to irritate the Nerves of the Nose; so that what we call Sternutatories, or such Substances as excite Sneezing, produce happy Effects in restoring drown'd Persons to Life: <HI>Indian</HI> Marum or Euphorbium introduc'd into the Nose, or reduc'd into a Powder and blown up the Nostrils, will in all Probability produce salu∣tary Effects, since if they operate they will excite a violent Expiration, sufficient to remove all those Obstacles which the Air finds to its free Discharge. Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> warmly recommends this Practice, as also Injections of spirituous Liquors. Thus the
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>Injection of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac into the No∣strils, operates more powerfully than holding vo∣latile Sal Ammoniac to them. Perhaps Vinegar will stimulate yet more strongly, and with better Effect.</P>
<P>All those Authors who treat of the Measures proper for restoring drown'd Persons to Life, or∣der a Vomiting to be excited, in order to procure a Discharge of the Water contain'd in the Stomach. This is the Doctrine of <HI>Codronchus, Forestus, Ca∣merarius,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Joly,</HI> who imagines that the Water in the Stomach of drown'd Persons, is one of the Causes of their Death. In order to excite this Vomiting, they order the Throat to be tick∣led with the bearded End of a Quill. <HI>Becker</HI> and <HI>Dethardingius</HI> order a Feather to be introduc'd into the Oesophagus, in order to excite such a Motion of the Epiglottis, as is sufficient to procure a Dis∣charge of the Air contain'd in the Breast. Now 'tis sufficiently known to every Body, that the bearded End of a Quill excites Vomiting. We must here observe, that Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> only orders Vo∣miting to be procur'd after drown'd Persons return to Life. But it is certain, that vomiting can pro∣duce no happy Effects, if there is nothing in the Stomach, or only a Quantity of Water equal to that daily us'd by most People. As for liquid E∣metics, their Effects appear to be highly dubious, since the Oesophagus may possibly be in such a con∣vulsive State, as to hinder Deglutition. <HI>Dethar∣dingius</HI> looks upon this Irritation of the Throat, as a Circumstance of the highest Importance; but for exciting it, prefers a certain Instrument invented in <HI>Germany,</HI> and describ'd by <HI>Heister</HI> in his Sur∣gery.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> the <HI>Swedes,</HI> attempt to restore the Lives of drown'd Persons, by Means
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>of Fomentations, with anti-apoplectic Medicines; that is, such as are of an hot and spirituous Nature. <HI>Borelli</HI> in <HI>Obs.</HI> 11. <HI>Cent.</HI> 2. informs us, that he suc∣cessfully us'd toasted Bread soak'd in warm Brandy, applied to the Region of the Heart, and frequent∣ly renew'd. <HI>Nymman</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Apoplexia. Cap.</HI> 44. orders us to apply to the Nostrils of drown'd Per∣sons, odoriferous Substances, and such as are car∣pable of putting the Spirits in Motion, and re∣storing the Action of the Heart, and the Functi∣ons of the Brain. Of this Kind are Penny-royal Rue; and Lilly of the Valley, soak'd in Vinegar. He, also, orders us to apply to the Region of the Heart, Epithems prepar'd of Baum, Rue, Mar∣joram, Amber, Cinnamon, and Lavender. Thus for Instance;</P>
<P>Take of the best Rose-Water an Ounce and an half; of Baum-Water two Ounces and an half; of Rosemary-Water one Ounce; of Malmsey Wine one Ounce and an half; of Lemon Juice one Ounce, of the Powder of Cloves one Scru∣ple; of Theriaca one Dram, and of Camphire and Saffron each half a Dram. Mix all together, and in the Liquor soak a Spunge, to be applied to the Region of the Heart.</P>
<P>As the genital Parts of both Sexes have a near and intimate Correspondence with the Heart, as is obvious from the Effects of Cordials, applied to those Parts, in Syncopes, Faintings, and other Affections of the Heart, so <HI>Nymman,</HI> in order to restore drowned Persons to Life, orders these Parts to be fomented with warm Wine, in which Cinna∣mon, Cloves, Musk, and Baum have been boiled.</P>
<P>But if any Success is to be expected from these Remedies, it is principally, when by the Assistance of Frictions, the most volatile Parts of Spirituous Liquors are made to penetrate into the Mass of
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>Fluids; and it is highly probable, that indepen∣dently of the Experience of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> this Me∣thod will answer the End proposed by <HI>Dethardin∣gius,</HI> which is, the procuring of a free Expiration; for, if the Admixture of the spirituous. Parts of cordial Liquors restores the Course of the Spirits and Blood, it must necessarily follow, that both must be more copiously conveyed to the Muscles destin'd for the Purposes of Expiration.</P>
<P>It is also certain, from Experience, that one of the most efficacious Expedients for restoring drown'd Persons to Lise, is speedy Venesection, especially in those Parts, most proper for relieving the Head, as the Ankles, for Instance, and the Jugular Veins. The Use of Venesection, in such Cases, must be sufficiently obvious to every one who considers, that drowned Persons, as well as those who are hang'd, die of an Apoplexy of the sanguineous Kind, and not for Want of Respiration, or, as is commonly imagined, on Account of a Repletion, or choaking up of the Breast by Blood; for when such Persons are laid open, the Breast is found almost entirely void of Blood, and the Brain extremely inflamed; both which Phoenomena are highly agreeable to the Laws of the Circulation.</P>
<P>These are the most common and approved Me∣thods of restoring drown'd Persons to Life; but, if they should happen to prove ineffectual, the last Resource is, what we commonly call <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> or <HI>Tracheotomy,</HI> which consists in opening the <HI>Tra∣chea,</HI> in order to procure a free Access of the Air to the Lungs. This Operation is principally in∣tended to remove the obstinate Adherence of the Epiglottis to the Orifice of the Glottis; in conse∣quence of which Circumstance, the Air con∣tained in the Lungs is freely discharged. Tra∣cheotomy was indeed originally intended for the Extraction of foreign Bodies from the <HI>Trachea,</HI> or
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>for the procuring an Access of the Air to the Lungs when the Inflammation of the Muscles of the <HI>La∣rynx,</HI> is so considerable in Quinseys, as to close up the Aperture of the <HI>Glottis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tracheotomy,</HI> according to <HI>Dethardingius,</HI> has all the Advantages which can be wished for, since it affords Relief <HI>speedily, effectually,</HI> and <HI>agreeably: Speedily,</HI> because there is no more expeditious Me∣thod of procuring a Discharge of the Air, which, by its natural Spring, and by the continual Com∣pression of the Abdomen, must necessarily be eva∣cuated in that Manner. Now the Air cannot escape from the Pulmonary Vesicles, without their collap∣sing and expressing into the Pulmonary Vein, the Blood which had entered the Pulmonary Artery, which cannot happen, without adding a greater Fa∣cility of Circulation to the arterial Blood. Now the Blood arriving at the left Auricle, and thence at the left Ventricle, produces a new Contraction of the Heart; upon which the Circulation is re∣established, and Life discovers itself by manifest Signs, especially by Respiration.</P>
<P><HI>Tracheotomy,</HI> also, affords Relief without Dan∣ger, because we are no longer afraid of making an Incision in those Cartilages, which the Ancients, in Consequence of their bony Nature, imagined inca∣pable of Consolidation. We no longer dread the Hemorrhage, since only a few Drops of Blood are discharged in opening the Membrane, which unites the Ringlets of the <HI>Arteria Trachea;</HI> and since there are not contiguous to the Part, such large Blood Vessels, as being wounded would produce terrible Effects. There is no Danger of injuring the Voice by means of this Operation, since the Operator cannot hurt the Muscles of the Larynx; and since there are no Nerves, the Dilaceration of which should impair or destroy the Sensation of the Part.
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>In a Word, it is no difficult Task to heal up, and consolidate the Wound, for this is readily effected by means of a Plaister, or some balsamic Ointment.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Tracheotomy</HI> affords Relief <HI>agreeably,</HI> for it cannot possibly be painful to a drowned Person, whose Senses are so locked up, as to render him incapable of feeling Pain. Thus the Operation is performed, without being intercepted by the Cries, the Groans, and Motions, which Pain would pro∣duce.</P>
<P><HI>Paulus Aegincta</HI> is the first Author extant, who describ'd the Operation of <HI>Broncotomy,</HI> from <HI>Antyl∣lus.</HI> But the judicious and accurate <HI>Heister,</HI> in his Surgery, describes this Operation very distinctly. The Words <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> says he, <HI>Laryngotomy,</HI> and <HI>Tracheotomy,</HI> are convertible Terms, and mean no more than an Incision of the <HI>Aspera Arteria,</HI> or what we commonly call the <HI>Wind-Pipe:</HI> and indeed va∣rious Causes and Circumstances concur, to render this Operation absolutely necessary on some Oc∣casions; for, in the first Place, it becomes princi∣pally and indispensably so, when in a Quinsey, the Fauces are so terribly inflamed, that the Patient is in imminent Danger of having his Respiration quite stopt, and a total Suffocation brought on. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It becomes necessary, when a Bean, a Prune, a Cherry-stone, a Pea, or any other extraneous Sub∣stance falls into the <HI>Aspera Arteria,</HI> and seems to threaten a Suffocation. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>Aspera Arte∣ria</HI> is also to be opened, in such Persons, as have been suffocated, in Consequence of their being im∣mers'd in Water, or as we commonly express it, in newly drowned People; for Respiration has been often restored to Persons in this Condition, by open∣ing the <HI>Aspera Arteria,</HI> and by that means procu∣ring a free Access of the Air to the Lungs. I am sufficiently appriz'd, that a great many forbid ma∣king
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>an Incision in the <HI>Aspera Arteria,</HI> and conse∣quently condemn this Operation; because they think it productive of Death, and are therefore prompted by an idle Zeal, to brand the Physicians, who approve an Operation, so dangerous in their Eyes, with the odious Appellations of barbarous and inhuman. But the Gentlemen, who are of this narrow and confined Way of Thinking, are grossly mistaken; for in this Operation, the small Incision made in the <HI>Aspera Arteria,</HI> is so far from killing the Patient, that it does not produce that Effect when made considerably large; and <HI>Garen∣geot</HI> gives Examples of various Cures performed by this Operation; so that we think ourselves autho∣riz'd with <HI>Casserius, in Tr. de Vocis, Auditus{que} Orga∣nis,</HI> to pronounce those Men unskilful, timorous, and even cruel, who in the Cases now mentioned, foolishly neglecting this Operation, which is not only safe, but also attended with the most speedy and salutary Effects, suffer the Patients to die for Want of this seasonable Assistance. Instances of this Nature may be seen in <HI>Nicolai Fontani Observat. Rarior. Analect.</HI> and in <HI>Casserius.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Bronchotomy</HI> is to be perform'd, that Part of the <HI>Trachea</HI> seems most proper for making the Aperture in, which is situated between its second and third cartilaginous <HI>Annuli,</HI> or Ringlets. The Incision, may, however, be made a little lower, without any Danger. The Method of performing the Operation, especially when a foreign Substance falling into the Aspera Arteria, and threatning a Suf∣focation is to be extracted, is thus. The Patient is first of all to be situated in a reclining Posture, either in Bed, or in some convenient Chair, and his Head is to be held firm by an Assistant standing behind his Back. Then a longitudinal Incision is to be made, thro' the Skin, Fat, and Muscles,
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>from about two Fingers Breadth below the <HI>Carti∣lago Thyroides,</HI> or Seutiformis, or the <HI>Pomum Ada∣mi,</HI> in the middle of the <HI>Trachea,</HI> down to the very Sternum, so that the Length of the Incision may be two, three, and in tall Patients, four Fin∣gers Breadth in Length.</P>
<P>Then an Assistant is carefally to draw the Lips of this Orifice from each other, either with proper Hooks, or with his Fingers; and having absorb'd and wip'd away the Blood, either by a Spunge or Linnen Cloth, so that the <HI>Aspera Arteria</HI> may be seen, three or four of the Annuli or Ringlets of that spiral Pipe, are to be cut in such a Manner, that the Incisions made in the Whole, may form one continued Line, and thus whatever Substance may have slipt into it, is to be artfully and cauti∣ously extracted, either by a Probe, Hook, or For∣ceps. This being done, the Wound is to be cleans'd, with a Spunge, and its Lips being kept in Contact by adhesive Plaisters, a proper Compress and Ban∣dage are to be applied. It is afterwards to be care∣fully agglutinated, by means of vulnerary Balsams, as in other Wounds of the <HI>Aspera Arteria.</HI> By this very Method, continues <HI>Heister,</HI> I myself in <HI>Helm∣stadt,</HI> happily extracted a Piece of boil'd Mush∣room from a Patient, who happening to laugh while he was supping Broth, in which among other Things there were Mushrooms, had the Misfor∣tune to have a Piece of one of them slip into his <HI>Aspera Arteria,</HI> by which means he was in Danger of being suffocated. <HI>Ravius,</HI> continues <HI>Heister,</HI> also inform'd me, that by this very Method, he happily extracted a Bean from the Throat of a Pa∣tient. Some in order to induce a more speedy and seemly Cicatrix on the Wound recommend Con∣glutination by Suture as in the Hare Lip. But 'tis certainly absurd to follow a Practice attended
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>with so much Pain to the Patient, whilst Methods equally good, and at the same Time far milder may be pursu'd.</P>
<P>But in all Cases where a Suffocation is either dreaded, or actually present, <HI>Tracheotomy</HI> is abso∣lutely necessary, and may be perform'd in three different Manners. In the first of these the Patient is to be plac'd in a Bed or Chair, with his Head reclin'd at the Operator's Discretion, and held firm by an Assistant, as before directed. Then let the Surgeon make an Incision in that middle Part of the Throat, and in the same Manner as before or∣der'd, till he reaches the <HI>Trachea</HI> itself, if he thinks proper; the Skin on both Sides is to be laid hold of by the Assistant; then it may be rais'd and cut longitudinally. After these Measures are taken, the Fat and Muscles lying above the <HI>Trachea</HI> are to be cut. Some would have these Muscles first disen∣gag'd from the <HI>Trachea,</HI> or cautiously separated from the others; but there is no Occasion for all this Labour, since they may be cut safely and with∣out any Danger. Then the Operator is to cleanse the Wound with a Spunge wrung out of warm Wine, or warm Spirit of Wine for stopping the Blood more effectually. The Assistant is, in the mean Time to separate and retract the Lips, either by Hooks, or by his Fingers. Then the Surgeon is to pass his Knife between two of the Annuli of <HI>Trachea,</HI> or he may even pass it in such a Manner as to cut one of them, since by that means a silver or leaden Pipe either round or flat, furnish'd with <HI>Ansae,</HI> or a Rim, so as to prevent its falling into the <HI>Trachea,</HI> may be conveniently inserted into the Wound. But before the Surgeon withdraws his Knife, some proper Probe ought to be inserted in the Wound, by the Side of the Knife, that by its Assistance a Pipe may be more commodiously and
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>put into it. This Pipe is fix'd in the Wound by means of a Ligature pass'd thro' its Annuli or small Holes in the Rim, and carried round the Neck, as also by means of a perforated adhesive Plaister: But great Care is to be taken that the End of the Pipe which is inserted into the Wound be not per∣mitted to touch the posterior Part of the <HI>Aspera Arteria</HI> lest by this means a troublesome Cough should be excited. But that the Lungs may not be injur'd by external Cold, or any Filth falling upon them, it is highly proper, to lay upon the Pipe, a Spunge, often impregnated with warm Wine, and again wrung out; or as <HI>Garengeot</HI> advises, a thin Linnen Cloth, and afterwards a perforated Plaister. These Directions being duly observ'd, Blood is to be taken either from the Veins of the Neck or Feet, those under the Tongue, or those si∣tuated in the Neck. When Respiration is totally restor'd, which is most quickly discover'd by stop∣ping up the Pipe with one Finger, the Pipe is to be taken out, and the Wound agglutinated in the Manner above directed. But when the Difficulty of Breathing at the Mouth is considerable, the Pipe is to be left for some Time longer in the Wound, and the other Medicines continued.</P>
<P>Another and more expeditious Method of open∣ing the <HI>Trachea,</HI> is this, a two edged Knife is ap∣plied to the abovemention'd Part of the Throat, and cautiously pass'd thro' the Skin, Fat, and Muscles, into the Cavity of the <HI>Trachea</HI> itself, and a Pipe is forthwith inserted into the Wound, and carefully secur'd in the Manner before directed. This Manner of Operation is not only quicker, but also produces a smaller Cicatrix than the former.</P>
<P>The third and last Method of performing this Operation is, with an Instrument call'd a <HI>Trocar,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>in tapping for the Dropsy, which no Surgeon ought to be without. This Instrument applied to the Middle of the <HI>Trachea,</HI> may, as it were, at one Thrust be pass'd thro' the Skin, Fat, and Muscles, into its very Cavity. Then taking out the perforating Part, let the Pipe remain in the Orifice till the Pa∣tient recovers. This Method of Operation, seems in one Respect, to have the Advantage of all the rest, which is, that it is soon over, and the Pipe at the same Time introduc'd into the Wound with far less Pain to the Patient, than by any other Me∣thod: But even in this Case the same Caution ought to be us'd, and the same Directions follow'd, which we have above specified.</P>
<P>If Persons drown'd, continues <HI>Heister,</HI> are but just dead, their <HI>Aspera Arteria</HI> is to be open'd with all Expedition, either with an Incision-knife, or any other Instrument the Surgeon shall judge pro∣per. Then it is expedient strongly to blow into the Orifice, either with the naked Mouth, or by Means of a common Pipe, the Shank of which is to be introduc'd into the Wound, whilst the As∣sistant blows into the Bole. The learned <HI>Dethar∣dingius,</HI> in a Dissertation on this very Subject, in∣forms us, that by this Method, if speedily put in Execution, Life returns to the suffocated Patients, with the injected Air, and that he is in a Manner miraculously rais'd from the Dead. For this Rea∣son the Operation should in such Cases be perform'd with the greatest Haste and Expedition imagi∣nable.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> our Countryman, in his Surgery, as∣sures us that this Operation is absolutely void of all Danger, and describes it in the following Manner.</P>
<P>Bronchotomy is perform'd, by making a longi∣tudinal Incision thro' the Skin, three Quarters of an Inch long, between the third and fourth Ring∣lets
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>of the <HI>Trachea,</HI> when the Operator has his own Choice of the Place; it is always advis'd to pinch up the Skin in this Operation, which how∣ever may be left to the Discretion of the Surgeon, who when the Skin is cut thro', must make a small transverse Incision into the Wind Pipe, and imme∣diately introduce a crooked <HI>Canula,</HI> near half an Inch long, of Silver or Lead, with a Couple of little Rings at the Top of it, thro' which a Rib∣band may be pass'd round the Neck, to keep it fix'd in the Wound.</P>
<P>Some have prescrib'd making an Incision thro' the Skin and Trachea at once, with a Lancet or Knife as the more easy and expeditious Manner, and says the Author, I once saw it perform'd in this Way, but it prov'd very inconvenient; for the Wind-pipe, in Respiration moving up and down, slipp'd from the Orifice of the Skin, and made it very difficult to introduce the Canula, and afterwards maintain it in its Situation. Wherefore I think it absolutely necessary to make an external Incision longitudinal, and even pretty large, as I have directed above.</P>
<P>The Caution of raising the Sternohyoidei and Sternothyroidei Muscles before opening the Wind-pipe is not to be regarded; and as to the Division of the recurrent Nerves, and large Blood Vessels, so much dreaded in this Operation 'tis not in the least to be fear'd, since they are quite out of the Reach of the Instrument, as any Person skill'd in the Anatomy of these Parts, must very well know.</P>
<P>The Method of dressing is easily understood; since after the Patient can breath by the natural Passage, if we withdraw the Pipe, the Wound becomes a simple one, and notwithstanding its Pe∣netration thro' a Cartilage, into a large Cavity, re∣quires only a superficial Application.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
<P>Upon the Whole it appears beyond all Contra∣diction, that <HI>Bronchotomy</HI> is a safe Operation, and has been so often perform'd with Success, that no Surgeon has any Reason to hesitate in performing it, in Cases where particular Circumstances indi∣cate its Propriety. For this Reason 'tis sufficiently obvious, that this Operation ought with all Expe∣dition to be perform'd on drown'd Persons, many of whom have been happily restor'd to Life by this very Means. It is carefully to be observ'd, that this Expedient, is far more efficacious than blowing into a Person's Mouth, as is confirm'd by the fol∣lowing Experiment made by <HI>Becker.</HI> This Phy∣sician hang'd a Dog, till no more Motion of his Heart was perceiv'd, and having left him dead on the Ground for half a Quarter of an Hour, he to no Purpose blow'd Air into his Throat. Then he perform'd the Operation of <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> and hav∣ing thrice blown the Air into his Lungs, the Breast of the Dog began to elevate itself, and at the fifth Blast, he mov'd his Feet. After this he was blood∣ed in the Throat to give Vent to the Blood, and at last gave some howling Barks, but surviv'd the Ac∣cident for several Years. Now as the Cause of Death is the same in drown'd as in hang'd Ani∣mals, why should not the same Means restore them both to Life.</P>
<P>I have been very particular with respect to the Operation of <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> because it is of great Importance, and of singular Use in more Cases than one; and that no one might be ignorant of the Me∣thods of performing it. In the Case before us, that of drown'd Persons, it may frequently be necessary where no Surgeon is to be procur'd soon enough to retrieve the Misfortune and preserve Life. In this Situation, as there is no great Danger of injuring a Person, who appears to be dead, and must be
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>absolutely so without immediate Relief, any com∣mon Person, tho not bred a Surgeon, may by these Directions, be enabled to perform the Ope∣ration, by making a Perforation in the Place above directed, with any Sharp pointed Knife. Then in∣stead of a Canula or Tube of Metal, if that is not at hand, a Tobacco Pipe may be broken about three Quarters of an Inch, or an Inch, from the Bole, and the Part contiguous to the Bole may be introduc'd into the Perforation, taking Care not to break it within the <HI>Trachea;</HI> and then by blowing into the Bole, the Lungs may be inflated.</P>
<P>After having thus collected every Thing of any Importance upon the present Subject, we must beg Leave to observe, that, tho' with Respect to Mat∣ters of Religion and Conscience, it is not only ex∣tremely absurd, but also highly cruel and barbarous to invoke the Assistance and Interposition of the secular Power. Yet in the present Case, such an Attempt is so far from being either absurd or bar∣barous, that it bespeaks Compassion and Huma∣nity; for we may safely appeal to Experience how many worthy Members of Society, generous Friends, affectionate Husbands, tender Parents, and dutiful Children, have in foreign Countries been restor'd to Life by these very Means; where∣as in <HI>England,</HI> Persons of equal Worth, have for Want of proper Care, been laid in their Graves, at a Time when they might, for many future Years have prov'd the common Blessings of the various Communities of which they were Members.</P>
<P>This melancholy and deplorable Consideration, will sufficiently authorise me to propose a Regula∣tion to the Legislature of <HI>England,</HI> whose princi∣pal Aim seems ultimately to terminate in the greatest and most extensive Happiness of the Subject. It
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>is, that this Treatment of Persons supposd to be drown'd, may be enforc'd by all the Authority of the Law; and that no one may be suffer'd to be buried without it; and this under severe Penal∣ties; for otherwise I am afraid these Endeavours of mine, however well intended, will not have the desir'd Effect, nor be attended, to so much as the Subject deserves.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="appendix">
<HEAD>AN APPENDIX. Concerning the Methods of restoring hang'd Persons to Life, and Children sup∣pos'd to be born dead.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>England</HI> is above all other Nations in the World, justly branded with <HI>Suicide,</HI> com∣monly known by the Name of Self-murder, and as our Countrymen frequently make Choice of a Rope for that Purpose, we shall briefly point out the Methods of restoring hang'd Persons to Life.</P>
<P>'Tis certain then, that hang'd Persons die of an A∣poplexy of the sanguineous Kind, produc'd by an Ob∣struction of the Blood, by the Rope, in the jugu∣lar Veins, whilst the Arteries being freer from this Compression, continue to convey the Blood to the Brain. We may form a Judgment of the Effects produc'd by a Compression of the jugular Veins, from the following Passage of <Q><BIBL><HI>Alexander Benedictus</HI> in <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 33.</BIBL> "When, says that judicious Author, a Redundance of Blood obstructs the
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>arterial and venous Canals, and intercepts the free Circulation of the Spirits, the Patient falls down in the same Condition as if he was, hang'd. The <HI>Assyrians</HI> sometimes put sound Persons into a similar State, when for Instance they intended to circumcise Adults or Children. Thus having laid them on their Backs in a Bath, they com∣press'd their jugular Veins, so as speedily to pro∣duce a Privation both of Motion and Sensation; and taking the Advantage of this Circumstance, cut off the Prepuce with as much Ease as if the Patient was in an Apoplexy. The same is the Condition of those who having attempted to hang themselves, are found suffocated, tho their Feet touch the Ground."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nymman,</HI> also, in <HI>Tr. de Apoplexia, cap.</HI> 14. de∣clares his Sentiments on this Subject in the follow∣ing Manner. <Q>"The Functions of the Brain, says he, are destroy'd without any Lesion of the a∣nimal Spirits and Nerves, as appears in a Syn∣cope. The like happens to hang'd Persons, who are no sooner hung up, provided an expert Executioner exactly brace up the Vessels of the Neck, with the Rope, than they become immove∣able as a Log of Wood, without even so much as moving their Feet, notwithstanding which Phae∣nomena, the Brain and Origin of the Nerves suf∣fer nothing in such Persons; since those Parts are defended by the Cranium and Vertebrae, which can never be injur'd by the Rope. Nor is the Interception of Respiration to be accus'd as the Cause of Death in hang'd Persons, since tho we closely shut up the Mouth and Nostrils of an Animal so as to hinder the Access of Air into the Breast, yet as the Brain still retains its vital Spirit, it powerfully opposes the imminent Dan∣ger of a Suffocation, by a violent Agitation of
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>the Body, and an excessive Motion of the Feet, which Circumstances are never observ'd in hang'd Person."</Q></P>
<P>From these Authorities we evidently see the speedy Effects produc'd by the Compression of the jugular Veins. This Doctrine is farther illustrated by <Q><BIBL><HI>Bartholine</HI> in <HI>Cent,</HI> 1. <HI>Hist.</HI> 32,</BIBL> "In dissecting, says this Author, a Man of a tall Stature, of a sanguine Temperament, and vigorous Constitu∣tion, who was hang'd for a Robbery, I found his Lungs preternaturally large, blewish, streak'd with different Colours, light and spungious, and so full of a frothy Blood, that every where on the Membrane which covers them, the Veins not only appear'd turgid, but the Lobes were also so large as to embarrass me in dissecting the Heart. The Ventricules of the Brain were full of Water, as also the Origin of the Nerves which enter the Spine. The <HI>Plexus Choroides,</HI> also, besides the Inflation of its Vessels, con∣tain'd a great many Vesicules."</Q></P>
<P>The Loss of Knowledge in hang'd Persons, also, proves the Truth of this Doctrine, and this Loss is sufficiently attested by <HI>Camerarius</HI> in <HI>Cent.</HI> 7. <HI>Hist.</HI> 40. where we are told, that a Robber being hangd and falling into the Hands of the Surgeons for Dissection, was nevertheless restor'd to Life, not∣withstanding his Mouth was full of Froth, which is generally look'd upon as an infallible Sign of irri∣trievable Death, especially where it continues long, as it did in the present Case, and notwithstanding he had before his Execution been seiz'd with a Fit of Madness. When this Man, however, was re∣stor'd to Life, he said he rememberd nothing of what had pass'd on that Occasion, except that he was conducted to the criminal Chamber, after which he was insensible of every Thing. This
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>Robber was hang'd a second Time for committing fresh Robberies, a convincing Proof, that he did not look upon the first as a formidable Punish∣ment. <HI>Camerarius</HI> in <HI>Hist.</HI> 38. mentions another, who was twice hang'd; and in <HI>Hist.</HI> 39. another who was restor'd to Life by the Physicians of <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI> after he had been hang'd.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> in his History of Life and Death, relates an Accident, which like that of <HI>Camerarius,</HI> proves the Loss of Knowledge in hang'd Persons. A young Gentleman of some Distinction, curious to know the Pain suffer'd by hang'd Persons, having fix'd a Rope about his Neck, threw him∣self from a low Stool upon which he imagin'd he could easily put his Feet again: But his Attempts of this Kind were in vain, and he had been irre∣trievably suffocated, without the Assistance of a Friend who had the Curiosity to be present at such an unaccountable Experiment. Upon his Reco∣very, his Friend asking him if he had felt any Pain; he answer'd that he had perceiv'd none in any Part of his Body; but added, that at first he observ'd before his Eyes, a Species of Fire or blaz∣ing Light; then an extreme Darkness, and last of all a pale Blue, or a Sea-green, like that which frequently presents itself before the Eyes of those who fall into Deliquiums. Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> subjoins, that he heard a Physician of Candour and Worth, assert, that he had restor'd Life to a Man who had been hang'd half an Hour, affirming at the same Time, that by proper Means the same Effect might be produc'd upon others, who had hung no longer, provided the Effort of their first Fall had not lux∣ated the Vertebrae of their Necks.</P>
<P>After having thus discover'd the Cause of Death in hang'd Persons, we are the better able to form
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>an Estimate of the Means most proper to restore them to Life.</P>
<P>Frictions then, and hot Baths, by restoring the Motion of the Blood, and resolving its Coagula∣tion, must for these very Reasons produce happy Effects on hang'd Persons. <HI>Pechlinus</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Aer. &amp; Aliment. Defect. cap.</HI> 7. relates an Observa∣tion, which sufficiently evinces the Efficacy of Sal Ammoniac on similar Occasions. <Q>"I knew, says he, a Woman hang'd, who after she had re∣main'd for some Time without Pulse and Respi∣ration, with her Lips cover'd with Froth, which is look'd upon as an infallible Sign of the total Pri∣vation of Life, and in a Word, after she appear'd to be the necessary Victim of Death, was yet re∣stor'd to Life, by a Physician who coming acci∣dentally to the Place where she lay, made her swal∣low a considerable Quantity of the Spirit of Sal Ammoniac."</Q> As the Activity of this acrid vola∣tile Liquor, and its Propriety to resolve coagulated Blood are sufficiently known; it is by no means surprising, that it should on similar Occasions pro∣duce such happy Effects. <Q>"<HI>Pechlinus</HI> subjoins, I don't in the least doubt, but if proper Measures were taken in due Time, a great many hang'd Persons might be restor'd to Life, even after those who have an Opportunity of seeing them, think they have all the Reason in the World, to conclude them really and irretrievably dead. This Effect is most commodiously produc'd by restoring the Circulation of their Blood, by means of Frictions, Venesections, and the Ex∣hibition of hot and spirituous Remedies, or of some other analogous Substances."</Q></P>
<P>It is sufficiently easy from what we have before said, to conceive, how Venesection is excellently calculated for restoring Life to hang'd Persons,
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>and as for spirituous Liquors, they act at once on the Blood and Vessels, By attenuating the former, and restoring the proper Spring and Tone of the latter. The Remedies of this Kind are before specify'd.</P>
<P><HI>Schenkius</HI> in <HI>Observat. Art. de Suffocat. ex Laquea,</HI> orders that drown'd Persons should be made to swallow Vinegar and Pepper; or Oxymel mix'd with the Powder of Penny-royal. He, also, advises to excite a Vomiting by means of a Feather dipt in Oil, and to wrap up the Patient's Neck in a Woollen Cloth dipt in warm Oil, especially the Oil of Orris.</P>
<P>The Virtues of Oxymel, or of simple Vinegar with Pepper, are sufficiently evinc'd by <HI>Christo∣phorus de Vega Art. Med. Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Sect.</HI> 5. <HI>Cap.</HI> 8. All Physicians are sufficiently appriz'd, that Vine∣gar moderately us'd, is a powerful Resolvent, whilst Pepper is an acrid Substance, equally pro∣per to dissolve the Coagulations of the Juices, and reanimate the Fibres, by the Irritation it produces in them. The Powder of Penny-royal is, also, an acrid Aromatic, whose Effect must of course be nearly the same with that of Pepper.</P>
<P>As for exciting a Vomiting in hang'd Persons, I think it more dangerous than in those who are drown∣ed; for the Contractions of the Muscles subservient to Expiration, may serve to restore that Function as we have already observ'd, since the Inflation of the Abdomen and Breast of hang'd Persons, is a Proof that their Inspiration is forc'd and unnatural, yet in such Circumstances it seems dangerous to con∣vey a greater Quantity of Blood to the Head which is before overchargd with it, as is sufficient∣ly obvious, not only from the preceding Histories, but also from the livid Colour of the Countenance. It is, however, certain, that the Shocks given to the Parts by means of the Vomiting, are very
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>proper to dissolve the Coagulations of the Blood, though I would never advise the Use of this Me∣thod, till after a previous Venefection.</P>
<P>The Topic mentioned above, which <HI>Schenkius</HI> orders to be applied to the Neck, may produce very happy Effects, by resolving the Blood col∣lected in the Skin and Muscles of the Neck, and relaxing the Parts which had suffered most imme∣diately by the Rope.</P>
<P><HI>Gesner,</HI> for a Girl who hang'd herself, success∣fully ordered Powder of Castor, which he forc'd down in warm Broth. This Remedy is also of a volatile and resolvent Nature. <HI>Joubert. in Lib.</HI> 4, <HI>it Effect. Thor. Cap.</HI> 1. informs us, that he re∣stored many hang'd Persons to Life, without such a Multiplicity of Expedients; since he used no other Method than Venesection, and forcing into their Stomachs a due Quantity of good Wine.</P>
<P><HI>Ranchinus in Tr. de Morb. subit. Cap.</HI> 12. orders Oil of Orris, or of Lillies, to be applied to the Necks of hang'd Persons, whilst their Mouths are to be gargariz'd with Syrup of Violets, dissol∣ved in warm Water, or Barley-water. He also prescribes Vomiting, excited by a Feather, in order to enlarge the Passages more. The same Author also recommends Pepper and Penny-royal, either in Vinegar, Oxymel, Wine, or the <HI>Aqua Caelestis.</HI> But Venesection is the Expedient on which he depends most for happy Effects. The Oils and the Syrup are only intended to procure a Relaxa∣tion; and as for the Gargarism, it cannot be usd till the hang'd Person is previously restored to Life. The Pepper, Penny-royal, and other Substances mentioned by him, are design'd to re-animate and restore the natural Heat.</P>
<P><HI>Aelius in Tetrabibl. Serm.</HI> 8. <HI>Cap.</HI> 49. orders us to add to the Pepper and Vinegar, Nettle-seeds, which are also of an highly acrid Nature. The same
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>Author affirms, that when the Redness round the Neck of hang'd Persons is dissipated, they open their Eyes, and the Parts are relaxed. He is also of Opinion, that we ought not to spare Fomenta∣tions of the Neck, with warm Oils, Cerate, or Woollen Cloths.</P>
<P><HI>Ranchinus,</HI> from other Authors, greatly extols a Remedy which most People will think as singular in itself as disagreeable to the Person who administers it. It consists of blowing into the Mouth of hang'd Persons, provided the Administrator has in his own Mouth, a bruis'd Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cloves, or Carraway-seeds. As it is certain, that these Aro∣matics produce no other Effect, than impregnating the Air with some volatile Parts, proper to restore the Motion of the Fluids, so 'tis equally certain, that the principal Efficacy of this Practice depends upon the <HI>Blowing,</HI> which in this Case must infallibly produce Salutary Effects; as is obvious from the following Experiments, recorded in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 28. of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal society of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First then,</HI> Doctor <HI>Croon,</HI> Professor of <HI>Gresham-College,</HI> in the Presence of the Royal Society, strangled a Pullet, in such a Manner, as that it dis∣covered no more Signs of Life; but by afterwards blowing into the <HI>Arteria Trachea,</HI> he so effectually restored the Motion of the Lungs, that the Pullet returned to Life.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Doctor <HI>Walter Needham,</HI> in the Pre∣sence of Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> and other <HI>Literati,</HI> hang'd a Dog, till the Motion of his Heart was no longer to be perceived, after which he open'd the Abdo∣men of the Dog, and blowing into the Thoracic Duct, restored the Motion of the Blood, upon which the Heart began to beat, and the Dog re∣turned to Life.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Doctor <HI>Hook,</HI> in the Presence of the Royal Society, cut the Ribs, the Diaphragm, and Pericardium of a Dog, after which, making an Incision in the superior Part of the Trachea, he in∣troduced into it the Pipe of a Pair of Bellows; then he blow'd the Air into the Lungs, and the Dog returned to Life; but died when he ceased to blow: By which Expedient he made him live and die alternately, as long as the Company pleas'd.</P>
<P>A <HI>fourth</HI> Experiment is that of <HI>Becker,</HI> by which he restored a hang'd Dog to Life, by opening his Larynx, and blowing the Air into his Lungs, through the Incision made; so that the Practice en∣joined by <HI>Ranchinus,</HI> is by no Means to be neg∣lected.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the first and fourth Experi∣ments are absolutely the same with the Practice re∣commended by that Author. Now, Why may not that which has succeeded twice, succeed of∣tener? Though the other Experiments doe not so directly prove the same Truth, yet it may be ea∣sily deduc'd from them; for from the second it fol∣lows, that the Air is not only necessary to the Cir∣culation, because by dilating the Lungs it gives a free Passage to the Blood, from one Ventricle of the Heart to the other, but also is requisite to keep the Blood in such a State of Solution, as Circula∣tion requires. Now, by blowing Air into the Lungs, we inflate their Vesicles, which is the first Advan∣tage produced by Respiration; and the Air by this Means insinuating itself into the Blood, re∣solves its Coagulation. By means of this Expli∣cation, 'tis easy to comprehend how Doctor <HI>Hook</HI>'s Experiment favours the Doctrine of <HI>Ranchinus.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been said, we may therefore con∣clude, First, that blowing in the Mouths of hang'd Persons is a proper Method of restoring them to
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>Life; Secondly, That if this Method does not succeed, we are to perform the Operation of <HI>Bron∣chotomy,</HI> and by that Means blow Air into their Lungs: <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That we ought not to be discou∣raged at some fruitless Attempts, because a Prac∣tice, which with <HI>Becker,</HI> did not succeed till the fifth Time, may perhaps, in other Circumstances, not succeed till later: Fourthly, That we must not at the same Time, neglect these other Means, which have a Tendency to restore the lost Fluidity of the Blood: Fifthly, That if Death does not suc∣ceed Strangulation, this is rather the Effect of the Stiffness of the Cartilages which compose the La∣rynx, or according to some, of the Slackness of the Rope, than of the easy Disposition of the Blood to resume its Fluidity: Sixthly, That it is highly probable, that an efficacious Method of re∣storing drown'd Persons to Life, would be, to in∣ject Air into the Blood, by introducing a small Pipe into some of the larger Veins, for that Purpose; For what Difference is there between making the Air enter the Blood by the Thoracic Duct, or by any other Part. The only Caution which I think ought to be given, is, to make choice of those Veins most contiguous to the Heart; so that for this very Reason, as well as for their Largeness, and the Facility of finding them, I judge the ex∣ternal Jugulars most proper for this Purpose.</P>
<P>Having already observed, that as the Cause of Death is the same in hang'd and drown'd Persons, so the Measures taken for the Relief of the one, may be also used for restoring the Lives of the others, We proceed to give some Histories of Facts, which prove the Possibility of restoring suffocated People to Life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Falconet</HI> then, a Gentleman of strict Probity and Candour, told Dr. <HI>Bruhier,</HI> That his Father
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>had a fool-hardy Coachman, who falling into a Quarrel at <HI>Lyons,</HI> killed a Man, and being appre∣hended on the Spot, was forthwith condemn'd to be hang'd, which Sentence was accordingly put in Execution. The Surgeons of the Town having ob∣tained his Body, in order to make a Skeleton, brought it into a Surgery, where they left it upon a Table; but when they came next Day to dissect it, they were surprized to find the Man not only alive, but in good Health, and pissing in the Chim∣ney, for want, as he said, of a Chamber-pot.</P>
<P>This Man had stood in no Need of Remedies, certainly, for no other Reason, but because the Circulation of the Blood had not been so long sup∣pressed, but that it could of its own Accord restore itself.</P>
<P><HI>Oswaldus Gabelchaverus</HI> relates, in one of his Ob∣servations quoted by <HI>Schenkius,</HI> the History of a Merchant of the Name of <HI>Landthtaler,</HI> who was hang'd on a Tree for some Villanies he had com∣mitted: He hung for a whole Hour, and the Ser∣vants who had Orders to inter him, having cut the Rope, perceived, as they thought, some Marks of Life in him, upon which they put him in a Cart, convey'd him to a proper Place, and soon restored him to Life. He afterwards us'd to say, that he was sensible of no Pain in hanging, except in his Eyes, and the Extremities of his Toes. About eighteen Years after, however, he began to follow the same Practices, for which he had been hang'd before; but <HI>Prince</HI> Charles <HI>of Aremberg</HI> ordered him to be hang'd a second Time, in such a Man∣ner, that he never returned to Life.</P>
<P><HI>Caesariensis in Illustr. Mirac. Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>Cap.</HI> 24. re∣lates the History of a certain Robber, who had been hang'd a little before a Servant belonging to a Canon of <HI>Cologne</HI> happened to come up to the
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>Gallows. The Servant imagining there were still some Remains of Life left in him, cut the Rope, and restored him to Life, by some cold Water ta∣kenfrom an adjacent Rivulet. The Robber, in the mean time, gradually resuming his Strength, fol∣lowed his Deliverer, who was going to the next Town, and just as they were talking with each other, the Robber laid hold of the Bridle of the Servant's Horse, cried out aloud, that the Horse belonged to him, and swore that the Servant had robb'd him of him: This Debate having drawn to∣gether a large Concourse of People, their Indig∣nation was so strongly moved against the Servant, that without hearing what he had to say in his own Justification, they were determined to drag him to the Gallows from which he had lately cut down the Robber: but luckily for the Servant, some Inhabi∣tants of the neighbouring Town, seeing a Con∣course of People going to the Gallows, which be∣longed in common to both Towns, came to see what the Matter was: then the Crowd suffering the Servant to speak, he related his Adventure, and the Manner in which the Robber had recompenc'd his Service. The Robber being at last known, was a second Time hung upon the same Gallows, in such a Manner as not to return to Life.</P>
<P>Though the Ground-work of the following His∣tory resembles the preceeding, yet it differs from it in many Circumstances, the most considerable of which is, the long Time the Criminal continued hang'd.</P>
<P>A Miller near <HI>Abbeville</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> happening to goe near the Place where a Robber had been hang'd the Day before, suspected that he was not dead. Compassion having induc'd him to satisfy his Sus∣picion, which was well-founded, he cut him down, laid him in a Cart, convey'd him to his own House,
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>and used such effectual Means to restore him to Life, that in fifteen Days the Robber recovered perfect Health. The Miller upon this intended to give him a little Money, and take his Leave of him; but delaying for some Time to put that Intention in Execution; he left him one <HI>Sunday</HI> alone in his House; the miserable Wretch forgetting what he owed to his Deliverer, broke open a Cupboard, and carried off all the Plate and ready Money he could find. The Miller, upon coming home, and finding his House robbed, easily concluded, that his Guest was the Person who had done it: accord∣ingly the Miller, his two Sons, and a Cart-driver, pursuing the Robber, overtook him about a League off, and dragging him to the Gallows, whence he had been cut down, hung him up a second Time, and gave him such Shocks, that they put it out of his Power to commit any more Robberies. It is about forty Years since this Accident happen'd, and Doctor <HI>Bruhier</HI> informs us, that it is attested by Persons of the best Reputation in <HI>France;</HI> and a Pardon was actually procured for the Miller, his Sons, and Servant, who took the Liberty of exe∣cuting the Robber, without legal Authority.</P>
<P>Before we put an End to this Treatise, which we intend for the common Good and Benefit of Man∣kind, we shall say something with Respect to the Methods of preserving the Lives of Children, who appear dead when born. No two Abuses then, are more prejudicial to Society, contrary to Humanity, or inconsistent with Reason, than to inter Women big with Child, without performing the <HI>Caesarian</HI> Operation upon them; and without any Attempts of Relief, totally to abandon Children who seem to be born dead.</P>
<P>The former of these Abuses is founded on two Errors; the first of which is, that the Infants do not survive their Mothers, when they die near their
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>Time; an the second, that the Lives of Children depend absolutely on those of their Mothers. Now these two Errors are destroyed by several Histories, which prove, that the Death of the Mother does not necessarily produce that of the Child.</P>
<P><HI>Caspar Reies,</HI> then, in his <HI>Campus Elysius Jucun∣darum Questionum,</HI> relates from <HI>Cornarius,</HI> <Q>"That a Woman of <HI>Madrid,</HI> of the illustrious Hose of <HI>Lasso,</HI> being reputed dead, after remaining three Days, in the utmost Agonies, was put in∣to the Tomb belonging to the Family, which being open'd some Months after, her Corps was found, with an Infant tenderly grasped in her right Arm; for, continues the Author, the Woman was pregnant, an near her Time, when she was interr'd as dead."</Q></P>
<P>The following History is also related, by the same Author, and attested by some of the most learned and judicious Men in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><Q>"The Wife of <HI>Francis Arevallo de Swasso,</HI> fell ill in the City of <HI>Segovia,</HI> during the last Months of Gestation: However, as she died, or rather was taken for dead, in a few Days she was in∣terr'd, according to the Custom of the Place. The Husb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, in the mean time, who was sent for to a Place at a considerable Distance, whi∣ther he had gone about some Business, came home about the Middle of the Night, and being informed that his Wife, whom he loved to Ex∣cess, was dead and buried, he would at any Rate have the Satisfaction of seeing her once more: For this Purpose, he went to the Church, and ordered her to be raised from the Grave; hard∣ly was the Coffin open'd, till the Cries of a In∣fant were heard; the By-standers were astonish∣ed, a Justice was called, the Priests, and a great many others got Flambeaus, and attended the
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>Husband; the Shroud was lifted up immedi∣ately, upon which appeared the Head of an In∣fant, making a vigorous Effort to disengage the Rest of its Body from the Vagina. This Infant was not only extracted, sound, and alive, but al∣so lived to be Lieutenant General of the City of <HI>Cherez.</HI> The surprizing Manner in which he came into the World, laid a Foundation for his being called, <HI>The Son of the Earth.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>From these Histories, <HI>Caspar Reies</HI> draws the following Consequence. <Q>"'Tis evident that Children dont die with their Mothers when the latter die near the Periods of their Deliveries. <HI>Sennertus</HI> affirms, not only that they live for some Time after their Mothers are dead, but also that we may, and even ought, to extract them alive from the Uterus, <HI>Vincelius</HI> has com∣pos'd two Treatises in order to prove these Truths, which are also sufficiently establish'd in the Dissertations of <HI>Nymman, De Vita Foetus in Utero,</HI> where, as well as in other Authors we find a great many similar Histories; and others of Women who have been deliver'd of live Children after their own Death. The Reader may also consult <HI>Raynaud de ortu Infantum contra Naturam.</HI> Hence 'tis obvious, that we ought not to be too rash and precipitate in burying pregnant Women who die near their Times. I am not certain whether these Women were dead or alive at the Time of their Interment, tho' it appears evident from the Circumstances, that the first was buried alive; for <HI>Horstius</HI> proves from another Fact, that dead Women may be deliver'd of Children. Thus he informs us that a Woman big with Child, being hang'd along with her Husband by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldiers, be∣tween
<PB N="76" REF="78"/><HI>Deventer</HI> and <HI>Zutphen,</HI> was four Hours after her Death, deliver'd of live Twins."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Bartholin</HI> in <HI>Act. Hasn. An.</HI> 1673 relates an History which proves the same Truth, and which is, <Q>"That of a Child born two Days after the Death of its Mother, which happen'd in a La∣bour, in which three Midwives had employ'd all their Art and Skill. Thus 'tis certain from Ex∣perience, that dead Women may be deliver'd of live Children, and this has perhaps laid a Found∣ation for the whimsical and superstitious Practice of putting into the Coffins of Women who die big with Child, a Needle, a Thread, and a Pair of Scissars, as if the Manes stood in Need of those Instruments to tie and cut the umbilical Chord of the Infant about to be born. In short it has been observ'd, that Infants have been born in the Coffins of their Mothers."</Q></P>
<P>The same Author also mentions a Woman who in 1635, on <HI>Thursday</HI> about 9 o'Clock at Night died of Epileptic Fits. On the <HI>Friday</HI> the Foam was discharg'd from her Mouth, Cries resembling those of an infant were heard, and a sensible Mo∣tion was observ'd in the Abdomen of the Mother. On <HI>Saturday</HI> about 10 o'Clock in the Morning, the Woman discharg'd a great deal of Blood, so that on changing her Linnen, her Infant still warm, was found lying betwixt her Things. <HI>Bartholin</HI> adds, that the Physicians of the Town were of Opinion that the Mother had only died when her Mouth be∣came full of Froth, without which Circumstance the Infant could not probably have liv'd.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Miscellanea Naturae Curios.</HI> we have In∣stances of Women who have died near their Time, and been deliver'd sometimes of dead, sometimes of live Children, sometimes one, two, and three Days after their Deaths. These Instances are re∣corded
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>by <HI>Resler,</HI> first Physician to the Prince of <HI>Brieg</HI> in <HI>Obs.</HI> 318. <HI>An.</HI> 3. By <HI>Polisius</HI> in <HI>Obs.</HI> 42. <HI>An.</HI> 4. By <HI>Doleus</HI> in <HI>Decus.</HI> 2. <HI>An.</HI> 5. <HI>Obs.</HI> 137. By <HI>Hoyer</HI> in <HI>Decur.</HI> 2. <HI>An.</HI> and lastly by <HI>Hartmanus</HI> in <HI>Observat.</HI> 83. of the same Volume.</P>
<P>From what has been said 'tis sufficiently obvious, that those Persons are greatly mistaken who sup∣pose that the <HI>Foetus</HI> does not survive its Mother; for it is evinc'd from a Number of Observations, that the Life of the <HI>Foetus</HI> is sustain'd by a Circula∣tion peculiar to itself; that the umbilical Arteries, which terminate in the Placenta, convey thither a Quantity of Blood, which is carried back by the umbilical Vein, without passing to the Mother; and that, if this Blood undergoes any Change, it is only from a lymphatic or lacteal Liquor, which the Roots of the Placenta imbibe from the uterine Vessels. These Truths are at present universally a∣greed upon; so that before the Death of the Mo∣ther can destroy the Life of the Child, 'tis necessa∣ry to prove, First, That the lacteal Liquor ceases to be filtrated immediately after the Death of the Mother: Secondly, That the Suppression of this Filtration is an infallible, or even necessary Cause of Death. In Consequence of this, we must prove, that at every Circulation, the Juices of the <HI>Foetus</HI> have their nutritive and vivifying Principles ex∣hausted; and that the Foetus is incapable of su∣staining in the Uterus a Degree of Fasting, which it often supports for several Days after it is brought into the World. Now, as these Propositions can∣not be proved, so it cannot be evinced, that the Death of the Mother is necessarily succeeded by that of the <HI>Foetus;</HI> so that 'tis certain, we commit mani∣fest Homicide, by interring pregnant Women near their Time, without performing the <HI>Caesarian</HI> Operation upon them.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
<P>This is no new Doctrine, since in the <HI>Digest Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Tit.</HI> 8. these Words occur; <Q>"A Royal E∣dict prohibits the Interment of dead pregnant Woman, before we have delivered them, by Means of the <HI>Caesarian</HI> Operation. Those, who do otherwise appear, to have destroyed with the pregnant Woman the Hope of obtaining a living Man."</Q> It is highly to be lamented, that this Law is not universally put in Execution, since it is a Principle founded on the eternal and unalterable Nature of Things; <HI>That we kill those whom we do not preserve, when we have it in our Power.</HI></P>
<P>If it should be objected, that this Operation would, if not always, yet at least very often, prove an useless Attempt. I answer, that it is, an easy Operation, since it is performed by two or three Strokes of the Bistory, and a few Stitches of a Needle. Besides, though Children after this Ope∣ration should appear dead, yet we are not to trust to those Appearances, unless Putrefaction should remove all Doubt.</P>
<P><HI>Bhonius</HI> informs us, that the Faculty of Medi∣cine at <HI>Wurtemberg</HI> being consulted, in a criminal Process rais'd against a Mother for killing her own Child, answered, that Children were sometimes born so weak, as to appear for a considerable Time without Sensation, Motion, and Respiration; and that it was necessary to use vellications, Fomenta∣tions, Aspersions of Wine, Spirits of Wine, or <HI>Aqua Vitae;</HI> as also to make them swallow aroma∣tic Liquors, or blow spirituous Liquors into their Mouths and Nostrils, till they begin to cry, which is an infallible Mark that the Air has entered the Lungs.</P>
<P>As to these Measures, we have before shewn, that they have an evident Tendency to restore Life. But we must not here pass over a Practice, which,
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>of all others seems to be of the greatest Impor∣tance to still-born Children, which is, the sucking the left Nipple of the dead Foetus. This Method, as we are told in <HI>Ephemerid. Natur. Curios. Dec.</HI> 2. <HI>An.</HI> 5. prov'd successful, after vellications, Fric∣tions, spirituous Liquors, and other Methods had been tried in vain. Various other Instances of the Success of this Practice are found in the same Work, and in the Writings of other practical Authors. Though this Method may at first seem ridiculous, yet it will appear of the last Im∣portance to the Anatomist, who knows the Sensibi∣lity of the Breast, all whose Nerves center in the Nipple. <HI>Hannemaun</HI> also, orders a Sponge dipt in Red Wine, or <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> to be applied to the left Breast, and Pit of the Stomach, of still-born Chil∣dren. <HI>Heister,</HI> when speaking of such new-born Chil∣dren, as are excessively weak, or hardly appear to be alive, orders a robust, sound Man to breath in∣to their Mouths, immediately after he has drank a Dram of Brandy.</P>
<P>The last Method of restoring still-born Chil∣dren to Life is, to blow into their Mouths, as is obvious, from various well-attested Observa∣tions, with two of which we shall put a Period to this Work.</P>
<P><HI>Borelli in Hist. Cent.</HI> 3. <HI>Observ.</HI> 58. relates, that a Servant returning from the Fields, and finding his Master, whom he greatly lov'd, lying dead, he embraced him for a long Time, and by ac∣cidentally breathing in his Mouth, gradually re∣stored him to Life.</P>
<P>The learned <HI>Grubelius,</HI> in <HI>Miscellan. Nat. Curios. Dec.</HI> 2. <HI>An.</HI> 10. <HI>Obs.</HI> 44. informs us, that whilst a Physician was preparing the Remedies proper to restore to Life, a Woman, who had fallen into such a <HI>Syncope,</HI> that she was thought dead,
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>her own Servant, who had a great Attachment to her, restored her to Life by blowing in her Mouth. But 'tis probable, that this Method produces its happy Effects, rather by restoring the Motion of the Blood and Lungs, than by Means of that vivifying Principle, which some superstitious Authors suppose to be lodg'd in the human Breath.</P>
