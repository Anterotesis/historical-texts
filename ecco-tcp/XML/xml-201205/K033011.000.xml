<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO enjoy good health is better than to command the world, says a celebrated practical philosopher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Evremond.</NOTE>, who understood the use and value of life and health better than most men; for in exile, with a small income, and no very good constitution, he cultivated an uncommon length of days into a rational series of pleasures; and what is much more, an uninterrupted course of happiness. But, as far as I can find, he was almost the only man that did so. The generality of men seem to me not to bestow a thought upon either, till it be too late to reap the benefit of their con∣viction; so that health, like time, becomes valuable only when it is lost; and we can no longer think of it but with retrospect and regret.</P>
<P>That men in good health, the young and gay in their career, should be negligent of it, or abuse it, refusing to stop and listen to, or
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>take warning from others, is no great wonder; but it is very surprising that mankind in ge∣neral should be mistaken and misled for ever in the same perpetual round of fruitless attempts to repair and establish it; not the ignorant vulgar only, but the sensible, the judicious, men of parts, and knowledge in other things, in this case equally blind, should pursue, with the same vain hope, after repeated disappointments, the thousand and ten thousand idle arts and tricks of medication and quackery; never once lift∣ing up their eyes to Nature, or consulting her book, open as it lies for the perusal, convic∣tion and benefit of all.</P>
<P>Some industrious men, fancying that what∣ever is valuable must lie deep, have, with the greatest alacrity in sinking, plunged into the immense abyss of ancient, Greek, Roman and Arabic learning, in hopes to find good precepts of health, and sure remedy for disease. But after all their pioneering into endless heaps of rubbish, what have they found at last but this? That some of the ancients were very ingeni∣ous in guessing wrong; for guess was all they did; they never studied Nature at all, and therefore knew nothing of her; but either
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>blindly followed or combated each other's opi∣nions. School against school, and sect against sect, waged equal and endless war. In the art of physic it was impossible for them to know much; for before our immortal HAR∣VEY'S discovery of the circulation, there could be no physiology at all, nor any knowledge either of the internal structure or action of any one part of the body. Before the justly cele∣brated ASELLIUS and PEQUET there could be no idea of nourishment; nor was it known how our food passed into the blood, whether it went there or not, or what became of it. But now, since these lights have shone in upon us, all the ancient conjectures, reasonings, and sy∣stems, must vanish like morning clouds before the sun. Besides all this, there are some of our diseases which the ancients had not, nor have we all theirs: some few, and very few useful, discoveries they made in medicine, which have descended to us, and with some late tricks in chemistry are the chief foundation of modern quackery. Thus have men of deep learning, if the knowledge of ancient errors can be called so, sunk far out of sight of truth, which in things of general use and necessity,
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>particularly the health of mankind, lies most commonly upon the surface.</P>
<P>It has been of great disservice, as well as dis∣credit to the art of Physic, and every fair practiser of it, that men's expectations have been raised by the ignorant and presuming, or the dishonest and artful, to hope for too much from it, more than it ever did, or can do. Respite and relief may be had in most chronic cases; remedy, I fear, but in very few, if it be expected from art alone. But a skilful and honest Physician (unless he be sent for too late and dismissed too soon, which is generally the case) will em∣ploy those intervals of relief to introduce the powers of life and nature to act for themselves, and insensibly withdrawing all his medicines, and watching carefully over his patient's whole conduct, leave him confirmed, from convic∣tion of their necessity, in such good and sa∣lutary habits, as cannot fall to establish his health for life.</P>
<P>Possibly, if men were better informed of the real causes of their diseases, they might be less unreasonable in their demands, and learn to be contented with present relief; submitting
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>with patience to that plan of life which alone can lead them to, and preserve them in, per∣manent health. With this view of engaging men's attention to their own happiness, and undeceiving them in their vain and groundless hopes of remedy, and diverting them from the delusions of art to the realities of nature, I have ventured to publish the following Dissertation; which I must beg the Reader to consider as, what it really is, a hasty extract of a much larger work, intended to take in the whole circle of Chronic Diseases, here comprehended only in their representative the Gout. If what I have said may seem to want farther illustration, or more demonstrative proof, he will look upon it only as a sketch to furnish hints for his own thoughts and reflections, either to improve mine or reject them entirely, as may seem good unto him. If he thinks, from what I have said here, or in the <HI>brochure</HI> itself, that I mean to impeach the practice of physic in ge∣neral; I say, that it is not my intention. I would decry all quacks, from Aesculapius to the present, either as ignorant fools, or self-convicted impostors, advertising daily lies; whether mounted on stages, or riding in cha∣riots. But the art of physic fairly and honestly
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>practised I honour as the first of professions, comprehending the most useful, the most ex∣tensive and universal knowledge of nature. I think a real Physician the most liberal of characters upon earth; by which I do not mean every Doctor that goes about taking guineas, but him who will neither flatter the great nor deceive the ignorant, and who would prefer the satisfaction of making one invalid a healthy man, to the wealth of <HI>Radcliff</HI> or the vogue of <HI>Ward.</HI> But there is an evil spirit of quackery gone forth, that has possessed all orders of men among us. I would lay it, if I could, together with every demon of super∣stition and error, and restore the world to Truth and Nature.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE GOUT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>OWEVER common it may be for men that suffer to complain of the evils of life, as the un∣avoidable lot of humanity; would they stop but for a moment to consider them in the light of reason and philosophy, they would find little or no foundation for them in nature; but that every man was the real author of all of most of his own miseries. Whatever doubts may be entertained of moral evils, the natural, for the most part, such as bodily infirmity, sickness, and pain; all that class of complaints which the learned call chronic diseases, we most undoubtedly bring
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>upon ourselves by our own indulgences, ex∣cesses or mistaken habits of life; or by suffer∣ing our ill-conducted passions to lead us astray or disturb our peace of mind. Whatever no∣tions men have been taught or have received of other causes, such as accidental colds, or particularities of constitution, this or that thing disagreeing or surfeiting, &amp;c. these are too tri∣fling to produce diseases that commonly last for life: there must be something more substantial, something more constant and permanent in our daily habits, to produce such inveterate evils. Though if you read authors or consult practitioners, what do you find, but that you have taken cold, though you know not how, or that your complaints are gouty, rheumatic, bilious, nervous, &amp;c.? words that satisfy, though they give no kind of idea, and seem to have gained credit and assent only by the politeness of physicians, who, while they are taking their patients money, are too well bred to tell them disagreeable truths, and that it is by their own faults they are ill. To enquire a little further into this matter may be well worth our trouble; the task seems to have been left for me, and I will perform it most sincerely.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<P>I have long had it in my mind to write upon chronic diseases in general, in the hope of giv∣ing mankind, what most assuredly they have never yet had, a few rational ideas about them; thinking that, if the true original causes of them were fully and fairly set forth, men could not be so capitally mistaken to impute them, as they do, to the false and ima∣ginary, and therefore apply false and imaginary remedies; nor think that the general health of mankind were to be overset by every trifle, and the recovery of it lay hid in a few drops or powders of any kind. Did they better under∣stand the nature of chronic diseases in general, and whence they proceed, they could not be so unreasonable to think they might live as they list with impunity, expecting repeated remedy from art; or, did they know any thing of the nature of medicine, they would find that, though fits of pain have been relieved, or sickness cured by it for a time, the establish∣ment of health is a very different thing, de∣pending upon other powers and principles: the first may be and often is done by medicine, the other never. That their opinion of me∣dicine is vain and ridiculous must appear, I think, very evidently to any one who re∣collects
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>collects that the art of physic has now been practised, more or less regularly, above two thousand years; and most assuredly there is not yet discovered any one certain remedy for any disease. Ought not this to make us suspect that there is no such thing? How can it be, when different degrees of the very same disease require various means and methods, and the same thing that in one degree would relieve, or perhaps cure, in another might kill? It is by plan, by regimen, and successive in∣tention, that diseases must be cured, when they are curable; or relieved and palliated when they are not. The skilful in medicine, and learned in nature, know well that health is not to be established by medicine; for its effects are but momentary, and the frequent repetition of it destructive to the strongest frames; that if it is to be restored, it must be by gently calling forth the powers of the body to act for themselves, introducing gradually a little more and more activity, chosen diet, and, above all, peace of mind, changing intirely that course of life which first brought on the disease: medicine co-operating a little. That this is the truth, all who know any thing of nature or art must know: and I may safely
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>take upon me to say, that, though I firmly believe health may be restored in most cases that are not absolutely mortal, I am very sure that no invalid was ever made a healthy man by the mere power of medicine. If this be the case, how must the initiated, according as their hu∣manity is touched, either laugh at or pity the poor foolish world, surrendering at discretion to the most ignorant of quacks, pretending to in∣fallible remedies which are not in nature. But what is still more ridiculous, the patients them∣selves are often so ashamed to own they have been deluded, that they favour the cheat, by pretending to relief which they never felt.</P>
<P>I have collected a few materials for this work, which I intend to put in order, as soon as I can find time and industry enough to set about it in earnest; and, if I can finish it to my own satisfaction, perhaps I may some time or other trouble the world with it. At pre∣sent I think myself particularly called upon to say something of the gout, as that disease was to make a considerable part of my plan; and, as I see now so many, and hear of more, who are throwing away, not only their money very foolishly, but, as I verily believe, the
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>future health of their lives also, in hopes of a medical cure for it, to shew that such hopes are chimerical, and contradictory to every idea of true philosophy and common sense.</P>
<P>I shall therefore take a few extracts from this general plan, sufficient to shew the real original causes of all chronic diseases; which, though they have been multiplied without end, and numberless causes been assigned them, are certainly not many, and their first causes very few. I think they may very fairly be reduced to these three: Indolence, Intemperance, and Vexation.</P>
<P>From one or more of these three causes, I have undertaken to prove that all or mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> chronic diseases are produced; for different dis∣eases may have the same original cause, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> difference proceeding from the various degree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of strength and vigor in bodies; so that wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would be gout in one, in another might b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rheumatism, stone, colic, jaundice, palsy, &amp;c▪ The gout is manifestly, and I think confessed∣ly, a disease of the best constitution, and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore fairly stand as a representative of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the rest: as such I shall consider it for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>present, and speak of these causes in their order: but it may be necessary to say a word or two of the gout itself before we enquire into its cause.</P>
<P>The gout is so common a disease, that there is scarcely a man in the world, whether he has had it or not, but thinks he knows per∣fectly what it is. So does a cook-maid think she knows what fire is as well as Sir Isaac Newton. It may therefore seem needless at present to trouble ourselves about a definition, to say what it is: but I will venture to say what I am persuaded it is not, though contrary to the general opinion. It is not hereditary, it is not periodical, and it is not incurable.</P>
<P>If it were hereditary, it would be necessarily transmitted from father to son, and no man whose father had it could possibly be free from it: but this is not the case, there are many instances to the contrary: it is therefore not necessarily so; but the father's having it inclines or disposes the son to it. This is the <HI>causa proegumena</HI> or <HI>praedisponent</HI> of the learned, which of itself never produced any effect at all; there must be joined the <HI>causa procatarctica,</HI> or active efficient cause, that is, our own in∣temperance or mistaken habit of life, to pro∣duce
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>it; and accordingly, as this operates more or less, so will the gout be. Our parents un∣doubtedly give us constitutions similar to their own, and, if we live in the same manner they did, we shall very probably be troubled with the same diseases; but this by no means proves them to be hereditary: it is what we do our∣selves that will either bring them on, or keep us free.</P>
<P>If it were hereditary, it would appear in infancy and in women, which in general it does not. I may be told of some women who have had it. I believe never very young, nor till they had contributed to it themselves; for women, as well as men, may abuse a good constitution. I have heard likewise of a boy or two out of a million that had it, or some∣thing like it; but these boys had been suffered to sip wine very early, and been fed and in∣dulged every way most unwholsomely.</P>
<P>Those, who insist that the gout is hereditary, because they think they see it so sometimes, must argue very inconclusively; for if we compute the number of children who have it not, and women who have it not, together with all those active and temperate men who are free from it, though born of gouty parents; the
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>proportion will be found at least a hundred to one against that opinion. And surely I have a greater right from all these instances to say that it is not hereditary, than they have from a few to contend that it is. What is all this, but to pronounce a disease hereditary, and prove it by saying that it is sometimes so, but oftener not so? Can there be a greater absur∣dity?</P>
<P>No diseases are hereditary but those of taint or infection, and maleformation; the gout is none of these, and therefore is not hereditary.</P>
<P>If the gout be a disease of indigestion, and therefore of our own acquiring, we must rea∣son very ill, or rather not reason at all, when we say it is hereditary; for surely no man will say that indigestion is hereditary, any more than intemperance. There are whole nations of active people knowing no luxury, who for ages have been free from it, but have it now since the Europeans have brought them wine and spirits.</P>
<P>If the gout be thought hereditary because it is incurable by medicine, the same may be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of every other chronic disease, none of
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>which ever are cured by it, I mean, so as not to return again. When was there a man who, having had one fit of rheuma∣tism, stone, colic, &amp;c. however happily re∣lieved by art for a time, had it not again and again, or something worse in the place of it; till he became a confirmed invalid, and died long before his time; unless some very remarkable alteration took place in the course of his life to confirm his health? So it is in the gout: a man gets a fit of it, and by abs∣tinence, patience, time, and nature, the crude acrimony producing it is subdued and ex∣hausted, and he is relieved for that time; (he might be so much sooner, and very safely too, by the assistance of art judiciously em∣ployed) he recovers however, and in a few months is taken again. Why? Not from any thing inherent in his constitution, but because he returned to his former habit of life that produced it at first, and will for ever pro∣duce it, while the strength of his body lasts.</P>
<P>The truth is, we breed it at first, we renew it again and again, and bring it on ourselves by our own mistakes or faults, which we would fain excuse by throwing them back upon our parents, that our complaints may be
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>more justly founded. And as bankrupts, un∣done by idleness and extravagance, for ever plead losses and misfortunes; so do we in∣heritance to exculpate ourselves.</P>
<P>It is natural enough for those who believe the gout hereditary to think it also periodical, as if something innate and inherent in our constitutions produced it at certain times: but this is a great nistake; for, if it were periodi∣cal, it must be regularly so. The only pe∣riodical disease I know is the intermittent fever, which, till it be disturbed by the bark or any other febrifuge, is as regular as a good clock. The returns of the gout are always very un∣certain, according to the quantity or quality of accumulated indigestion within, and the strength of our bodies.</P>
<P>I come now to shew that the gout is not incurable. If by the cure of it be meant the administering a pill or a powder, or medicine of any kind to do it, I fear it is and ever will be incurable. It has been long and often at∣tempted in vain, from the origin of physic to this day, from the first quack to the present. Indeed there is a most glaring absurdity at first sight, that must stop any man of com∣mon
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>sense, who has the least insight into nature, or knowledge of the human frame: for, if the gout be the necessary effect of in∣temperance, as I hope to shew very evidently that it is, a medicine to cure it must be something that will enable a man to bear the daily intemperance of his future life un∣hurt by the gout or any other disease; that is, something given now that will take away the effect of a future cause. As well might a medicine be given now to prevent a man's breaking his leg or his neck seven years hence. One would think the utmost that any rational man could expect from me∣dicine was, that it should have power to re∣lieve and remove present disorders, leaving the body quite free, without pretending to insure it from future injuries. Here lies the error: men think the gout to be something latent in the body now, which, once well eradicated, would never return; not suspecting it to be no more than each day's indigestion accumulated to a certain pitch; that, as long as the vigor of life lasts, always brings on every fit, which once well over, the man has no more gout, nor seeds of gout in him than he who never had it; and, if he did not breed it again, most certainly would never have it
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>again. A proof of this is, that the gout has been often cured by a milk diet, which, as long as it lasted, has generally kept the patient free. But this method of cure I cannot ap∣prove, because it relaxes and enervates the man, and does not sufficiently support the health and vigor of his body.</P>
<P>Though I think the gout incurable by me∣dicine, it is so far from being incurable in its nature, that I am firmly persuaded it may be more easily and more perfectly cured than almost any other chronic disease; and this is another strong argument that proves it not hereditary. My reason is, that it is confes∣sedly a disease of the strongest and best con∣stitution relieving itself by throwing off harsh and bad humors from the vitals, and out of the blood upon the extremities, where they do least harm to the powers and principles of life and health; and as these humors can be nothing more than the daily accumulations of indigestion, if a man can live without breed∣ing constantly this indigested acrimony, he may most undoubtedly live free, not only from the gout, but every other chronic disease also. And that he may live so, not in a perpetual
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>state of mortification and self-denial, but with great ease and comfort to himself, in the truest, most philosophic luxury, I shall endeavour to prove, I hope to the satisfaction of all think∣ing, reasonable men.</P>
<P>I have said, that Indolence, Intemperance, and Vexation, are the original causes of all or most of our chronic diseases: perhaps a few ac∣cidents must be excepted, to which the strongest and healthiest are most liable; and the effects of fevers not happily ended; and which I except, to obviate all cavil and dispute with the men of art. I believe, to every considerate man, whose eyes have been opened so as to give him the least insight into nature, the truth of this proposition will be so self-evident, that he must instantly perceive it; and every invalid that will be candid enough to do it, may fairly trace all his complaints up to one or other of these causes. But it may require some explanation to the generality of men, who are so short-sighted as never to look back or forward far beyond the ken of their nose, and therefore never see either distant causes or effects; and when they are sick seldom enquire more than for some cold or surfeit of
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>yesterday, and to some such trifling cause im∣pute diseases that last for life. An accidental cold or even debauch that happens but seldom can have no such effect; and men otherwise healthy, living in good habits, soon get rid of both. It is the constant course of life we lead, what we do, or neglect to do, habitually every day, that if right establishes our health, if wrong, makes us invalids for life.</P>
<P>Men ignorant of the ways of nature in the production and support of animals, not know∣ing what she requires to preserve them in health and vigor to their utmost period, have conceiv'd very strange and most assuredly very false ideas of diseases in general, and seem to think every disease a distinct kind of being or thing, and that there are medicines opposed to each, that will certainly remove and cure it. This makes them so solicitous to know the name of their complaint, which once ascer∣tain'd, they think the remedy not far off▪ Poor men! Is not the gout sufficiently distin∣guished? But where is the remedy? Certainly not in the precarious skill of prescribing doc∣tors, or the secret of ignorant and enterprizing quacks. They fancy too that there is great
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>variety of constitution, with diseases unavoid∣ably peculiar to each: that certain times of life must produce many, and that it is impos∣sible to grow old without sickness of some kind or other. There is certainly no foundation in nature for any of these opinions, nor is there any real essential difference of constitution, but of strong or weak, and this is produced more by habit than nature. The strong by bad habits will become weaker, and by good the weak stronger. But the most delicate frames may be as healthy as the strongest, for the same reason that a squirrel may be as healthy as an elephant. There is no disease necessarily peculiar to any time of life, how∣ever the changes into the different stages of it may affect the valetudinary. And it is pos∣sible for men to live to great age without any disease at all, for many have lived to up∣wards of an hundred with uninterrupted health.</P>
<P>Not from the natural defects of our con∣stitutions therefore, but the abuse of them, proceed all our chronic diseases. That is, from Indolence, Intemperance, or Vexation.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
<P>Let us now proceed to enquire what must be the necessary effect of one or more of these causes acting daily upon the body; whether in the strongest and most vigorous frames it must not be the gout; in weaker, rheuma∣tism, colic, stone, palsy, &amp;c. or any, or all of the nervous and hysterical class.</P>
<P>First, of Indolence, by which I do not mean insensibility, but an inactive habit of life, tak∣ing the word in the general common sense it is now used.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> INDOLENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems to have been the design of Pro∣vidence that all men should labor, every one for himself: that some are rich enough to purchase the labor of others is a mere ac∣cident with regard to individuals, in which the care of Providence appears to be no otherwise concerned, than having unequally distributed those powers and abilities by which active and fiery spirits rise uppermost to preserve the har∣mony of subordination, without which society
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>could never exist. The rich and great have so far forgot this first principle of nature, that they renounce all bodily labor as unworthy their condition, and are either too lazy or too inattentive to substitute exercise instead of it: thus sacrificing health to indulgence and dig∣nity, they do not enjoy those advantages their superior stations and fortunes give them; but in happiness fall often below the laboring hind. I remember to have seen a very inge∣nious little book upon the origin of evil, in which labor is considered as a great evil. The agreeable author must surely mean when it is excessive, and urged on to the wearing and wasting the body; for in general labor is the first principle of good to mankind, and to none more than the laborious themselves. Does he mean that it would be better for us all, did the earth spontaneously bring forth her fruits in such abundance, that we should no more labor or contend for them than we do for the air, and have nothing to do but bask in ease, and riot in enjoyment? If so, I can by no means agree with him; for soon, very soon, in such a state of things, there would not be one healthy man upon the earth, and the whole race must quickly perish. Indeed,
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>I am afraid, notwithstanding all our unreason∣able and unphilosophical complainings, the utmost wit of man cannot remove the least evil out of nature, without taking with it all the good. But begging pardon for this little digression, and to come back to my own pur∣pose, I think he had been nearer the truth, had he put Indolence in its stead, which is a source of great evil. Nothing undermines the foundation of all our happiness, the health and vigor of the body, like it, or lays such a train of diseases to come. But I must endeavor to shew in what manner.</P>
<P>It is upon the minutest and almost invisible parts of the body, our best health, strength, and spirits depend: these fine parts, commonly called capillaries, are little pipes or tubes, the extended continuations of the larger blood-vessels, through which the finest parts of the blood must constantly pass, not only to keep these very small channels always free and open, but also that the particles of the blood may in their passage be attenuated, broken, and rub∣bed into globules perfectly smooth and round, and easily divisible into still less and less, till they escape the sight assisted even by the
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>microscope; which gives ocular demonstration of this most amazingly minute circulation. I have observed myself, and any curious pa∣tient man may see with a good microscope, in the pellucid membrane of any living ani∣mal, this surprizing minuteness. He may se∣lect and observe one single vessel, the smallest of those that convey red blood, many of which would not equal the smallest hair in size, through which the blood may be seen passing, not like a fluid, but a number of little red so∣lid balls pushing one another on till they come to the extremity or ramification of the vessel where it divides into two still less. There the first globule, stopping a little, and recoil∣ing, is pushed on again till it divides into two, and, losing its red colour, passes on in the smaller pipes fitted only to receive the serum; which undergoes the same circulation till it be refined into lymph, and this into still finer fluids; which, being thus prepared, escape into a subtility beyond all possible observation. Now the strength of the heart and arteries alone, in a sedentary course of life, is by no means sufficient to keep up and perpetuate this motion through these capillaries, but requires the assistance and joint force of all the muscles
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>of the body to act by intervals, compress the veins, propel and accelerate the circulation of the whole mass of blood, in order to force and clear these pipes, and to triturate, cribrate, and purify the fluid passing through, forming every particle of it into a perfect globule, which is the form all the atoms of matter must take from much agitation. Without this extra∣ordinary occasional aid, the little vessels would, by their natural elasticity, close up into fibres, or be obstructed by rough angular particles sticking in them, and stopping all passage. Numberless evils of the chronic kind, espe∣cially all nervous diseases, owe their origin to this cause alone. Accordingly we see most of those who have lived for any time in a state of indolence, grow emaciated and pale by the drying up of these fine vessels; or, if they happen to be of a lax habit, having a good appetite, and nothing to vex them, they may be loaded with fat; but they grow pale withal, many of those fine pipes being nevertheless closed up; so that they appear bloated, and their fat unwholsome, having much less blood in their veins than thinner people. Hence we may learn why these languid pale persons upon the least motion become faint and breath∣less,
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>the blood hurrying through the larger vessels yet free, and, like a crowd obstructing its own passage, causing a dangerous suffoca∣tion. Or, if they have not been long in this state, nor the capillaries quite closed, they glow, especially young women, with a momentary red, the fine vessels being for that time ex∣panded. Thus inactivity first forms obstruc∣tions in these exquisitely fine parts, upon which the health and vigor both of body and mind depend entirely, and lays the foundation of many diseases to come; which other conco∣mitant circumstances, such as a violent cold, excess of any kind, infection from without, or a particular disposition of the body within, make often fatal to many in this habit of life; and which the industrious and active never feel.</P>
<P>Now I would ask any reasonable person, capable of considering this operation of nature with the least glimmering of philosophy, or even the attention of common sense, and most assuredly it concerns every man to consider it well, whether he can conceive it possible to substitute any medicine to be swallowed, that shall act upon the blood and vessels like the
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>joint force of all the muscles of the body, act∣ing and reacting occasionally in a regular course of moderate daily labor or exercise. Unless this can be done, I will venture to pronounce that there is no such thing as a lasting cure either for the gout, or any other chronic disease. Yes, Sir, says a common practitioner, cordials, volatiles, bracers, strength∣eners, will do this, will keep up an increased circulation. Possibly they may for a few hours, by doing mischief for many days: but their action soon subsides, and the stimulus ceases; they must therefore be repeated and repeated for life. Woe be to him that takes them; and to him that leaves them off, unless it be done with great judgment. While they act, they coagulate the juices and corrupt the whole mass of blood; and when omitted, the patient must feel all the languors and horrors of a crapulary fever after repeated debauch; and must have recourse to them again and again, like a dram-drinker, who cannot bear his existence but in a state of intoxication. No, art can never come up to nature in this most salutary of all her operations.</P>
<P>But these obstructions from crude particles of the blood, and this inanition of the capilla∣ries,
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>are not all the evils produced by indo∣lence. That sprightly vigor and alacrity of health which we feel and enjoy in an active course of life, that zest in appetite, and re∣freshment after eating, which sated luxury seeks in vain from art, is owing wholly to new blood made every day from fresh food prepared and distributed by the joint action of all the parts of the body. No man can have these delightful sensations who lives two days with the same blood, but must be lan∣guid and spiritless. To introduce new juices the old must be first thrown off, or there will be no room, there will be too great a plethora or fulness; the first cause of disease in many cases. In a state of inactivity the old humors pass off so slowly, the insensible perspiration is so inconsiderable, that there is no void to be filled; consequently by degrees the appetite, which is the last thing that decays, that is, the desire of supply, must daily diminish, and at last be totally lost. Here art can do wonders; it can procure evacuations; we can bleed, purge, and vomit; but then, to do any good by these, the case must be recent, before the humors are vitiated by too long a stay in the body, which will be the case very soon, for
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>they are all in a perishable state, which makes their daily renewal so essentially necessary to health: but then these artificial evacuations dis∣charge all alike; the new, the middle, and the old juices; that is, the chyle, the blood, the serum, and lymph; and by this indiscri∣minate action make strange confusion in those that remain: whereas in nature's course there is a constant regular transmutation and suc∣cession from one state to another; that is, from chyle into blood, and blood into serum, serum into lymph, and so on, till they are all in their turn, like wave impelling wave, ha∣ving done their office in various shapes, ela∣borated and ground to such a minute subtility and fineness, that they pass off in the vapor of insensible perspiration. In a state of indolence they do not pass off either so soon or so regu∣larly as they ought, because there is not mo∣tion, nor consequently heat enough to throw off the vapor: they lodge in the body too long, grow putrid, acrimonious, and hurtful many ways, like the matter formed in an ulcer, which, while it is yet sweet, is more healing than any balsam the surgeon can apply; but when confined, it soon becomes corrosive, and like a caustic eats it's way all round in
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>fistulas to find vent. This shews the virulent acrimony of these confined and stagnating hu∣mors: hence the breath and perspiration, what there is of it occasionally, of indolent people is never sweet; and hence in jails, where these noxious vapors are collected and condensed from crouded wretches languishing in indo∣lence, very malignant and pestilential fevers arise.</P>
<P>Perpetual blisters have been often thought, and sometimes found, to be serviceable in draining off some of these superfluous juices be∣fore they are much corrupted, and making, by a faint resemblance of nature's action, a little more room for new; and it is for this reason they do any good at all, by increasing the general circulation, and forcing off a few of those humors that had circulated too long in the body, and were becoming acrid: for the quantity they discharge is so trifling, that there could be no physiology, nor even common sense, in supposing the evacuation to be the benefit procured. By a vomit or a purge the discharge is a hundred fold more, but the good obtained not always so great, because by these the humors are indiscriminately thrown
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>off, and much more of the new than the old. Many have used frequent bleeding to renew their blood, and I have known it answer very well to some, especially old people who had been long accustomed to it, whom it preserved to great age: but then it must be begun in time, before the whole mass of humors be vitiated, and continued for life. Is it not strange that men should seek and prefer these violent artificial methods to the simple, easy, pleasant and constant action of nature, and chuse rather to take a vomit or a purge than a walk, and wear a perpetual blister than make the least use of their limbs?</P>
<P>Thus indolence must inevitably lay the foundation of general disease, and according to the constitution and a few concomitant cir∣cumstances will be the kind of the disease: in the very best it may be gout or rheumatism; in the weaker habits colic, jaundice, palsy, stone, &amp;c. with all of the hysterical and hypochondri∣acal class. In vain have ingenious men of read∣ing and study, mental labor and sedentary life, who are more subject to disease in general than the gay and thoughtless, endeavour'd to obviate the evil by abstinence, an excellent means of
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>remedy in many cases, and which few practise but true philosophers, who are not the most likely to want it. But yet even they do not find it answer, and for the reasons which I have just given; that we cannot live two days in health and spirits with the same blood; there must be a new daily supply of that ethereal part of our food called up to the brain to sup∣port its own, as well as the labor of the whole body. By this I mean the most elaborated refined part of all our juices, which constantly repairs and nourishes the smallest vessels and fibres; whether I may be allowed to call it animal spirits or not, is not material. When∣ever this aether fails, we must necessarily feel languor and lassitude both of body and mind. With this difference, that in weariness of the limbs from much action the lees and coarser parts are thrown off also, and the first meal and first sleep soon supplies the defect. In mental labor the feculence remains to obstruct all appetite; there is no room, and therefore no call for supply; the whole man suffers and sinks.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> INTEMPERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>I COME now to speak of Intemperance, for Indolence, blunting all our sensations, naturally leads us to Intemperance: we want the whip and spur of luxury to excite our jaded appetites. There is no enduring the per∣petual moping languor of indolence: we fly to the stimulating sensualities of the table and the bottle, friend provokes friend to exceed and accumulate one evil upon another; a joy∣ous momentary relief is obtained, to be paid for severely soon after: the next morning our horrors increase, and in this course there is no remedy but repetition. Thus whoever is in∣dolent is intemperate also, and partly from necessity; and the evils necessarily following both these causes often make the rich and great more wretched than the poor, and the ballance of happiness is held more equally be∣tween them; for however other things may be distributed, happiness like water always finds its level among men. I wish this obser∣vation might cure these of their envy, and teach the others how to enjoy their wealth.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
<P>Before I return to my subject, I fear I must make an apology for what I am going to say, and hope no one will be offended, when I ven∣ture to say that nine in ten of all the chronic diseases in the world, particularly the gout, owe their first rise to intemperance. Many a good man, who piques himself upon being the most sober regular creature alive, and never eats but of one or two plain dishes, as he calls them, nor exceeds his pint of wine at any meal; keeps good hours, and never sleeps above eight or nine, may be surprized, if not affronted, to have his diseases imputed to in∣temperance; which he considers as a great crime. And yet he is often ill, sick in his stomach, troubled with indigestion, and crippled by the gout. The case is, we judge of tem∣perance and intemperance from our own habits, without any just idea of either. What we are used to do, and see others do, we think right, and never go up to nature for our knowledge. The best way to explain what I mean by intemperance, may be to inquire what is nature's law of temperance, and to deviate from that must be considered as intem∣perance. And here I must beg leave to ob∣serve, that temperance is a thing of which no
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>Englishman has or can have the least idea, if he judges from his own or his neighbors habits. To form some notion of it he must have seen other countries, particularly Spain, Portugal, or Italy, and observed how men live there. What they call temperance, or even tolerable living, with us would be thought downright starving. In this view temperance is local and compa∣rative; but what I mean is natural temperance not depending upon place or custom (for I do not mean fasting or abstinence, which can never be salutary but after repletion) and we must not judge of it from countries where a piece of bad bread and an onion with a draught of water is thought a tolerable meal; nor from our own, where beggars live better than the nobles of some countries, and where we riot in the choice of plenty native and exo∣tic every day.</P>
<P>To come then to my idea of it: I think there is an absolute, determined temperance, to be measured by every man's natural un∣provoked appetite, digestion and consumption, while he continues in a good state of health, and right habit of life. As long as a man eats and drinks no more than his stomach calls for,
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>and will bear without the least pain, disten∣tion, eructation or uneasiness of any kind; nor than his body consumes and throws off to the last grain; he may be said to live in a very prudent well-regulated state of temperance, that will probably preserve him in health and spirits to great old age.</P>
<P>This is nature's law: and the reverse of it, or indeed any great deviation from it, must be intemperance. When we eat without appe∣tite, or urge beyond moderate satiety, pro∣voked by incentives of any kind: when we drink without thirst for the sake of the liquor. Indeed I cannot allow him to be strictly tem∣perate who drinks any wine or strong liquor at all, unless it be medicinally, or now and then for the sake of society and good humor, but by no means every day.</P>
<P>Now let us compare this simple idea of tem∣perance with the common course of most men's lives, and observe their progress from health to sickness: for I fear we shall find but very few who have any pretensions to real temperance. In early youth we are insensibly led into in∣temperance by the indulgence and mistaken
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>fondness of parents and friends wishing to make us happy by anticipation. Having thus ex∣hausted the first degrees of luxury before we come to the dominion of ourselves, we should find no pleasure in our liberty did we not ad∣vance in new sensations, nor feel ourselves free but as we abuse it. Thus we go on till some friendly pain or disease bids, or rather forces, us to stop. But in youth all the parts of our bodies are strong and flexible, and bear the first loads of excess with less hurt, and throw them off soon by their own natural vigor and action, or with very little assistance from arti∣ficial evacuations. As we grow older, either by nature in due time, or repeated excesses before our time, the body is less able to free itself, and wants more aid from art. The man however goes on, taking daily more than he wants, or can possibly get rid of; he feels himself replete and oppressed, and, his appe∣tite failing, his spirits sink for want of fresh supply. He has recourse to dainties, sauces, pickles, provocatives of all sorts. These soon lose their power; and though he washes down each mouthful with a glass of wine, he can relish nothing. What is to be done? Send for a physician. Doctor, I have lost my sto∣mach;
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>pray give me, says he, with great in∣nocence and ignorance, something to give me an appetite; as if want of appetite was a dis∣ease to be cured by art. In vain would the physician, moved by particular friendship to the man, or that integrity he owes to all men, give him the best advice in two words, <HI>quaere sudando,</HI> seek it by labor. He would be thought a man void of all knowledge and skill in his profession, if he did not immediately, or after a few evacuations, prescribe stomachics, bitter spicy infusions in wine or brandy, vitriolic elixirs, bark, steel, &amp;c. By the use of these things the stomach, roused to a little extra∣ordinary action, frees itself, by discharging it's crude, austere, coagulated contents into the bowels, to be thence forwarded into the blood. The man is freed for a time, finds he can eat again, and thinks all well. But this is a short-liv'd delusion. If he is robust, the acrimony floating in the blood will be thrown out, and a fit of gout succeeds; if less so, rheumatism or colic, &amp;c. as I have already said. But let us suppose it to be the gout, which if he bears patiently, and lives moderately, drinking no madeira or brandy to keep it out of his sto∣mach, nature will relieve him in a certain time,
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>and the gouty acrimony concocted and ex∣hausted by the symptomatic fever that always attends, he will recover into health; if assisted by judicious, mild, and soft medicines, his pains might be greatly assuaged and mitigated, and he would recover sooner. But however he recovers, it is but for a short time; for he returns to his former habits, and quickly brings on the same round of complaints again and again, all aggravated by each return, and he less able to bear them; till he becomes a con∣firmed invalid and cripple for life, which, with a great deal of useless medication, and a few journies to Bath, he drags on, till, in spite of all the doctors he has consulted, and the infallible quack medicines he has taken, lamenting that none have been lucky enough to hit his case, he sinks below opium and brandy, and dies long before his time. This is the course I have lived to see many take, and believe it to be the case of more whom I have never heard of, and which any one may observe in the circle of his acquaintance: all this chain of evils is brought on and ac∣cumulated by indolence and intemperance, or mistaken choice of diet. How easily might
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>they have been remedied, had the real causes been known and attended to in time.</P>
<P>I believe I must here explain a little more fully what I mean by provoking the appetite, which I take to be the general mode of in∣temperance among men; for custom has made all kinds of incentives to excess so common, that those of daily use, far from being con∣sidered in the class of intemperance, are by most people thought to be not only salutary but necessary; and they never suspect the least evil from the common decoraments of the table, salt, pepper, mustard, vinegar; and yet, however extraordinary it may seem, I will venture to pronounce that excess in any of these must be doubly prejudicial to health; hurtful in them∣selves by their acrimony, they provoke the appetite beyond natural satiety to receive an oppressive load, which the stomach itself would soon feel, were it not artificially stimulated to discharge it into the blood by wine and strong liquors immediately after. Thus one error brings on another, and when men have eaten too much, they drink too much also by a kind of necessity. He will certainly be a healthier man, who is very moderate in the use
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>of these things, than he who exceeds; they may he sometimes useful as medicines; but can never add to the wholsomeness of our daily food. To give some weight to what I say, there are whole nations in the world that have never known any of them, and are healthy, strong, and vigorous.</P>
<P>If this be true of the common provocatives at every poor man's board, who is there that exceeds not nature's law? who is truly tempe∣rate? What shall we say of that studied, labored, refined extravagance at the tables of the rich, where the culinary arts are push'd to that excess, that luxury is become false to it∣self, and things are valued, not as they are good and agreeable to the natural and undebauch'd appetite; but high, inflammatory, rare, out of season, and costly; where, though variety is aimed at, every thing has the same taste, and nothing it's own. I am sorry and ashamed, that men professing luxury should understand it so little, as to think it lies in the dish or the sauce or multitude of either; or that urging beyond natural satiety can afford any real enjoyment. But this they do by all the researches of culinary and medical art, introducing all the foreign
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>aids to luxury, every stimulating provocative that can he found in acids, salts, fiery spices, and essences of all kinds, to rouse their nerves to a little feeling; not knowing the more they are chafed and irritated the more callous they still grow; and the same things must now be more frequently repeated, increased in quantity, and exalted in quality, till they know not where to stop, and every meal they make serves only to overload and oppress the stomach, to foul and inflame the blood, obstruct and choak all the capillary channels, bring on a hectic fever of irritation, that though it raise the spirits for the evening, leaves behind it all the horrid sensations of inanition and crapula the next morning; and but that nature is so kind as to stop them in their career with a painful fit of gout or some other illness, in which she gets a little respite, they would soon be at the end of their course.</P>
<P>Men bring all these evils upon themselves, either not knowing or not attending to two things: the one, that pleasure is a coy coquet, and to be enjoy'd must not always be pursued; we must sometimes sit still, that she may come and court us in her turn: the other, that plea∣sure
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>and happiness are as distinct things as riot and enjoyment: besides, pleasure is not in∣finite, and our sensations are limited: we can bear but a certain measure, and all urging be∣yond it, infallibly brings pain in it's stead. Let the men of high experience bear me testi∣mony, that this is true of all the luxuries of the table, wine, music, women, and every sensuality.</P>
<P>These men may tell me, perhaps, that I have made a mighty fine declamation against luxury and intemperance; but what is this to the purpose? they desire not to be told of their faults, nor to hear disagreeable truths which they know already. Have I no art or skill to reconcile health and luxury, no remedy, no rare secret to repair and restore sensation and vigor worn to rags? No Medea's kettle to boil anew? If not, do not describe to us a life of moderation, temperance, and exercise: it is not worth having upon these terms. I am aware of the unreasonable expectations of many, that their demands would rise high, some of them to the impossible. At present I am only setting forth the causes; when I come to
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>talk of remedy, I will endeavour to convince them that the artificial helps they expect are not in nature, but that there are in nature ways and means by which many gouty, broken constitutions, that have been despaired of, might be repaired and restored to a very desirable degree of health and enjoyment. But I must first say a word or two to the in∣temperate or mistaken in the middle class of life.</P>
<P>In England all degrees of men are furnish'd with the means of intemperance, and therefore it is no wonder that most men are intemperate. If they are less so in other countries, it is not that they have more virtue, but they want the means: their oppressive governments, the pre∣carious state of property, and their superstitious religion, keep them so poor that luxury is not in their power. They have however this ad∣vantage from their poverty, that they are much less afflicted with chronic diseases than we are. I verily believe there are more gouts in Eng∣land, than in all the rest of Europe: a proof that good living is more universal. But not to the advocates for this good living do I wish to ad∣dress
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>myself; I fear they will be as incorrigible as their superiors in higher and more refined luxury. But there are some not intemperate from choice, but example, habit, custom, mistake, not knowing their daily diet to be unwholsome and productive of their diseases. To these it may be of some use to have the un∣wholsome pointed out, and their choice direct∣ed to better things. Men of laborious oc∣cupations, who work in the open air, can and do bear great excesses and much unwholsome diet without much hurt: I never knew a sick or gouty gardener that was not a remarkable sot. But men of sedentary trades and business, shopkeepers of all kinds, feel much sooner and more heavily the ill effects of intemperance or mistaken choice in their meat and drink. Their first care therefore ought to be, not to add the diseases of intemperance to those of inactivity, but proportion what they take as well in quantity, as in quality, to their consumption. But let us see how well they do this. They all say they live upon plain things, and never indulge in made dishes; but they will eat heartily of a goose or duck, with a large quan∣tity of sage, onion, pepper and salt, a pig with similar preparation, and a hare with
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>higher and more compounded seasoning. Do they ever eat veal without stuffing, or even a leg of mutton without caper-sauce? If ever they eat a steak or a chop, if it is sometimes without pepper, I believe it is never without pickles, the worst of all poisons. They are surprized that such meals should rise on their stomachs with flatulence, sour and bitter hic∣cups and eructations, which if they did not keep them down with a sufficient quantity of wine or sometimes a dram, they would be troubled with all the time of digestion. If this method succeeds so far as to quiet their sto∣machs for the present, they go on with it, regardless or ignorant of future and distant consequences. Thus are these sharp, harsh, hot and inflammatory things forced out of the stomach into the blood, before it has had time to dilute and subdue, or reject them, and the superfluous load they bring along with them. And thus is laid the foundation of every dis∣ease, that appears when these acrid and fiery particles are accumulated in the blood to a certain degree.</P>
<P>There are others whose pretensions to plain diet may seem better founded, but who never∣theless
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>eat, and are fond of things un∣wholsome, and very unfit for men of sedentary lives, such as salted and smoked flesh and fish of all kinds, hams, tongues, heavy flour pud∣dings, toasted cheese, &amp;c. all which are of such hard and indissoluble texture, that they never dissolve well in the stomach of a plow∣man: the same salt, seasoning, and smoke, which harden and preserve them from putre∣faction before they are eaten, keep them from dissolution afterwards, so that they never are digested at all; nor is it possible any good nourishment should ever come from them: the salts they contain are indeed melted in the intestinal juices, and get into the blood, pro∣ducing, in the best constitutions, those tettery, itchy, or scaly eruptions, commonly but very erroneously called the scurvy, which is quite another kind of disease. To this kind of food is owing the bad health of country people, and their children's rickety heads and limbs, and big and hard bellies.</P>
<P>Another capital mistake many people fall into, who in other respects are very moderate in their diet, is, that the flesh-meat they eat is always over-done; if boiled too much, the
<PB N="54" REF="52"/>juices are lost; if over-roasted, fried, or broil∣ed, the action of the fire, continued too long, changes the mild animal flesh into something of another quality; the fat is made bitter and rancid, which fire will always do by the sweet∣est oil; and the scorched outside of the lean, dry and acrimonious: the less therefore all flesh-meat undergoes the power of fire, the milder and wholsomer it is. I do not mean by this to recommend the customs of Cannibals and Tartars who eat raw flesh; or beasts of prey, that devour animals alive: but it may be observed, that the first are free from our diseases, and the others amazingly strong and vigorous. We may learn this from them at least, that our meat cannot be the whol∣somer for being, as some call it, thoroughly done; and that we should learn to like it with some of its red juices unspoiled by the fire. Upon this principle the English cookery is to be preferred to the French, who stew and roast to rags; and of English cookery broiling must be the best.</P>
<P>This leads me to another observation, which perhaps none but physicians, or those who have studied well the nature of man and his aliments, are able to make. It is this: that
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>man being born to devour most of the fruits and animals of the earth and water, there ought to be a certain proportion of animal and vegetable substances in his food ; the ani∣mal tending spontaneously to putrefaction, the vegetable correcting that tendency from go∣ing too far: thus from the due mixture of both qualities results that neutral property, equally distant from acid as alkali, that is essentially necessary to produce good blood. This is so manifest, that whoever will observe attentively may see, whenever either of these prevails in the body, there is so strong a de∣sire and longing for things of the other sort, as well as pleasing sensation in the palate and stomach when they are taken, as plainly in∣dicate the natural want. Let a man have lived long upon flesh-meat wholly, he will have a most eager appetite for fruit and vege∣tables; and if kept too long without them, as is the case with those who have lived some time at sea, will grow sick of the real scurvy; but if before they are too far gone they reach the land, they will eat the first common grass they can come at, with more avidity than a horse or ox, and be perfectly cured by it. In like manner they who have lived long
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>upon vegetables (which regimen is often pre∣scribed to invalids, especially in the gout) will have great craving for flesh-meat. We ought to learn from all this to attend diligently to the calls of nature, and ballance the mix∣ture with due proportion, not only that our vitals may have the less labor in preparing and making our juices fit for nourishment, but to prevent the diseases that are peculiar to the predominancy of either. And here I may observe, that the error of most men's diet in every class of life is, that the acid, crude and austere, almost always abound; not that they do not eat flesh-meat enough, but they spoil it in the preparation and cookery, changing its animal nature into something worse than vegetable, taking off intirely all its tendency to dissolution and putrefaction by salting, smok∣ing, pickling, potting, and preserving things that in their own simple nature would soon corrupt and dissolve; but by these preparations are hardened and embalmed to keep for years like mummies. The same may be said of every kind of made dishes; the salts, spices, hot herbs, and acids, with which they are seasoned and compounded, preserve and harden them to keep for ever: the sauces and gravies
<PB N="57" REF="55"/>they swim in have the same effect as so much pickle. The things we feed upon ought all to be in a perishable state, or they will never furnish the materials of good blood; and what∣ever is hardened or seasoned so as to keep long before it be eaten, ought not to be eaten at all, for it will never dissolve in the stomach.</P>
<P>The nature of most chronic diseases, and their first symptom heartburn, as it is com∣monly called, plainly shew the original cause to be acid crudity prevailing in the juices; producing coagulations, concretions and ob∣structions of various kinds; all which are very manifest in the gout, rheumatism, stone, and most nervous cases: the remedies also, that sometimes relieve and palliate, confirm this; such as the volatile alkalies, hartshorn, salt ammoniac, testaceous powders, sope, &amp;c. Many may be surprized at this, and say it can∣not be; for, though they have these diseases, they take little or no acids: but there are many things they take that are acescent, that is, liable to become acid, especially by the heat of the stomach. This they are not aware of; but they are in their nature much more prejudicial than things already sour; for, be∣sides
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>that people take not these in any quan∣tity, the acescent never become sour but by the act of fermentation, which, being raised in the stomach where it ought never to hap∣pen, produces strange tumults, wind, vapor, gas, that is, that fume arising from ferment∣ing liquors of any kind, which has been known sometimes to kill at a stroke. It may here be necessary to enumerate some of those things called acescent. These are sweets of every kind, puddings, cakes, pastry, creams, confections, &amp;c. and every thing made of flour, especially fermented; bread in particular, so far from be∣ing the wholsome thing many imagine, is not only unwholsome by its acescency, but, by the strong ferment it contains, it forces into fermentation every thing capable of it, that it meets with in the stomach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whoever requires proof of this, may have it by the following experiment: Put a common toast into half a pint of water, and let it stand six or eight hours near the fire, so as to be kept in the heat of the human stomach, and it will be sour as vinegar.</NOTE>: the bread of London I fear is particularly so; partly by be∣ing robbed of its bran, which in some degree would soften and correct it, but chiefly by having in it, besides its usual ferment, a great quantity of sour alum, most absurdly added to
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>make it unnaturally white<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To be convinced of this, boil a pound of common London bread in a sufficient quantity of water to make it thick as gruel. Let it stand to subside; pour off the clear, and boil away all the water; the alum will be found at bottom.</NOTE> In this light we must also consider most sorts of seasonings, stuffings, force-meats, and compounded sauces. But the greatest acescent, or rather bane of all, high and low, rich or otherwise, whoever they are that take it constantly, is wine: wine alone produces more diseases than all the other causes put together. All men allow that wine taken to excess is hurtful: they see the imme∣diate evils that follow; but distant effects, that require more attentive and deducive observa∣tion, very few see or believe; and, judging from present and agreeable feelings, they say that a lit∣tle wine is wholesome, and good for every one, and accordingly take it every day, give it their children, and teach them to like it by debauch∣ing their natural taste in the earliest infancy: thus they come to relish it by habit, and to be uneasy without it, like snuff-takers without their tobacco; the want is equally habitual and unnatural in both cases; for the stomach wants wine no more than the nose does snuff: the immediate sensation of both, after a little
<PB N="60" REF="58"/>use, is pleasant; but the remote effect of the wine taken constantly infinitely more pernici∣ous than of the snuff. This hurts the nose only; the other accumulating a little indi∣gestion every day, corrupts all the juices of the body most essentially. And though it be often taken with a view to promote digestion and assist the operations of the stomach, it manifest∣ly does harm to both. Instead of digesting and dissolving, it hardens, and prevents dis∣solution, and curdles and corrupts the milky chyle and first juices produced from our food. It warms indeed and stimulates the stomach to greater exertion than is natural or necessary, and thereby enables it to discharge it's contents the sooner; whence that agreeable feel of warmth and comfort from it's immediate action. But by this extraordinary action it forces our food out of the stomach too soon, before it is soften∣ed, dissolved, and properly prepared, and sends it into the bowels crude, hard, and au∣stere, in that state to be carried into the blood, there to produce every kind of disease. What∣ever therefore the advocates for a little wine every day may think, or argue in favor of it; they are most undoubtedly in a very great error, and it were certainly much better and safer to
<PB N="61" REF="59"/>drink a bottle and get a little merry once a week, drinking water only or small beer at all other times: in which interval nature might totally subdue it, and recover intirely. Water is the only liquor nature knows of or has pro∣vided for all animals; and whatever nature gives us, we may depend upon if, is safest and best for us. Accordingly we see that when we have committed any excesses or mistakes of any kind, and suffer from them, it is water that relieves. Hence the chief good of Bath, Spa, and many other medicinal waters, es∣pecially to hard drinkers. It is the element that dilutes and carries off crudities and indi∣gestions, &amp;c. the mineral virtues they con∣tain may make them tolerable to the stomach in their passage, but do, as I believe, little more in the body: it is the water that cures. Wine, if it be not one of our own inventions, was given us as a cordial in sickness, weariness, sorrow, and old age, and a most salutary charm it would be for most of these evils, did we not exhaust it's power by daily use, and instead of taking it as such, drink it up as common draught in youth and health to make us mad. I know this is a very tender topic to touch upon, and too favorite a pleasure to
<PB N="62" REF="60"/>argue against, with any reasonable hope of convincing; most men having so indulged themselves in this bewitching habit, that they think they cannot live without a little wine every day, and their very existence depends upon it; their stomachs require it, nature calls for it, St. Paul advises it, it must be good. Thus men catch at every shadow of an argu∣ment that favors their inclinations. St. Paul advises it as a medicine sometimes, but certain∣ly not every day. There is no medicine I know of, that, taken every day, will not either cease to act entirely, or by acting too much do harm. It will be said, that many drink wine every day without gout, stone, or any disease at all in consequence of it. I be∣lieve not many, or I should know some of them. If any are so strong as to bear it to old age unhurt, they must be very active as well as strong to subdue it. But I have nothing to say to these; my business is with invalids who complain, and certainly ought not to measure constitutions with those above their match. The same arguments will hold equally in favor of every other bad habit. Your nose will want it's snuff, your palate it's spices; and when the fashion was for women to be small
<PB N="63" REF="61"/>waisted, their galled sides grown callous by the long compression of the stays wanted their support. Nature, like a true female, cries out at the first violence, but submits in time, is reconciled, and grows fond of the ravisher. But it is the business of philosophers to dis∣tinguish carefully between the real wants of nature and the artificial calls of habit; and when we find these begin to hurt us, we ought to make the utmost persevering efforts to break the enchantment of bad customs; and though it cost us some uneasy sensations at first, we must bear them patiently; they will not kill; and a very little time will recon∣cile us to better modes of life.</P>
<P>There is another capital mistake many labor under in the choice of their wine, preferring the strong, hot, and coarse sorts, Madeira, Port, Mountain, &amp;c. to the milder, more elegant, and certainly less unwholsome French and Italian wines, accounting them better for the stomach, and good against wind, &amp;c. My observation has been, that they who use these strong stomach wines to cure wind are never free from it, and all the gouty disorders of in∣digestion. Indeed, it cannot well be other∣wise;
<PB N="64" REF="62"/>for there is nothing so repugnant to natural digestion as the use of these strong liquors, which instead of dissolving harden every thing; and thus for ever, when the first warmth is gone off, leave a crapulary, crude, sour load of yesterday to ferment, fret, and irritate the stomach and bowels every day.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavor'd to point out two of the true, primary, capital causes of the gout, and most other chronic diseases; and most sincerely wish that what I have said may en∣gage those whom it mostly concerns, the gouty, the infirm and valetudinary of every class, to observe, reflect, and think for themselves upon the hints I have thrown out; in which light what I have said, must be considered, rather than as logical or demonstrative proof. I know the reasoning and arguments may be much improved and carried farther, and if I had more leisure I might have attempted it: but I am well aware of the unsurmountable difficulty of convincing men against their will by any arguments at all. I chuse therefore at present to invite them to self-conviction from their own observations and experience. I flatter myself they will find it well worth their pains,
<PB N="65" REF="63"/>to reason a little more than they do with and for themselves; and it will be a great point gained for them, if it turn their misled opinions from all that imaginary power of restoring health in any of that multitude of ridiculous and most truly contemptible medicines, that are daily obtruded upon the public, with end∣less lies to recommend them, by a set of the poorest, most ignorant and paultry rogues in the nation; and engage their attention to their true remedy, a right institution of life. In judging of which, if they find themselves un∣equal to the task, they may be assisted by men of humanity, skill, and honesty.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> Vexation.</HEAD>
<P>I COME now to the last general cause of chronic diseases, Vexation. A very fruit∣ful parent of many bodily evils, producing generally diseases of inanition, much more difficult, not only to be cured, but relieved, than those we suffer either from indolence or intemperance. But as it is not so common a cause of the gout as the other two, it may not
<PB N="66" REF="64"/>be necessary to consider it very minutely at present. I shall not therefore enter deeply into the regions of metaphysical conjecture, nor run wild after my own conceits, or theirs who have gone astray before me, in guessing at the incomprehensible union of soul and body, and their mutual powers of acting upon each other. I shall content myself with observing only, what may be of some use, that every great degree of vexation, whether in the shape of anger, envy, resentment, discontent or sor∣row, has most destructive and deleterious ef∣fects upon the vitals of the body, whether sudden and violent, or slow and lasting.</P>
<P>The first immediate effect of violent grief or vexation is to take off the action of the stomach intirely. Let us suppose a man, in the best health, the highest good humor and spirits, as well as good stomach, sitting down to dinner with his friends, receives suddenly some very afflicting news. Instantly his ap∣petite is gone, and he can neither eat nor swallow a morsel. Let the same thing happen after he has made a hearty, chearful meal, as suddenly the action, of his stomach, the whole power of digestion is out off totally, as if it
<PB N="67" REF="65"/>were become paralytic; and what he has eaten lies a most oppressive load. Perhaps as the excess of weakness is often convulsion, it may be rejected by a violent vomit, or do greater mischief. For which reason such strokes of distress are less hurtful received upon an empty than a full stomach. But why is this? what connexion is there between a piece of bad news and a man's stomach full or empty? Whatever the cause be, the effect is certain and invariable. Is it because the animal spirits, or the action of the nerves, whatever be the secret cause of their power, is called off to sup∣ply and support the tumultuous agitation of the brain, and the stomach, with all its append∣ages and their secretions, is left powerless and paralytic, and must therefore either act con∣vulsively or not at all?</P>
<P>Besides this pernicious effect of perverting the natural action of the stomach and intestines, the whole circulation of the blood is disturbed. The contraction and dilatation of the heart, that is, the alternate action by which it opens to receive the blood from the veins, and closes again to force it out through the arteries; which operation ought to be as true and certain
<PB N="68" REF="66"/>as the vibrations of a pendulum; are broken and uneven: the heart flutters, palpitates; now is overloaded with blood and in danger of suffocation, now receives none at all: conse∣quently all the secretions must be as irregular, some of the glands receiving too abundant a supply, that either hurries through, or oppresses and overpowers them, others none at all. Hence that hasty gushing of pale limpid urine in amazing quantities, those sudden bursts of unmeaning tears: sometimes great dryness and choaking thirst, sometimes the overflow∣ing of the mouth with water instead of saliva, and many other nervous and hysterical affec∣tions, fits, syncope, epilepsy, &amp;c. all which indicate the greatest tumults and perturbations in the inmost recesses of the nervous and vital frame. Many kinds of disease have sprung from this fountain, of such unaccountably horrid and terrifying appearances, that former∣ly they could no otherwise account for them, but by the malefice of sorcery, and the imme∣diate possession of devils.</P>
<P>In slower, more silent, but longer continued grief, the effects are similar, but not so violent. Many little strokes repeated will do the same
<PB N="69" REF="67"/>thing in time that a great blow does at once. The function of the stomach will be more gently disturbed and perverted, its juices vi∣tiated, and all its contents will for ever turn sour, bitter or rancid; so that no mild milky chyle, or wholsome material of nourishment, can ever come into the blood. The patient must languish with cachectic inanition, uni∣versal bad habit of body, or pine and waste with atrophy, the want of nourishing supply; whence arise complications of various diseases succeeding each other always from bad to worse: and unless he can subdue his anxiety, and restore peace of mind, he must in time sink under it, and die, as it is said, of a broken heart.</P>
<P>Whoever vexes long, must certainly want nourishment; for, besides the disturbed state of the stomach, it's broken appetite and bad digestion, from whence what supply there is must come not only ill-prepared, but vitiated into the blood; there can be no sleep in this state of mind: the perturbed spirit cannot rest; and it is in sleep that all nourishment is per∣formed, and the finer parts of the body, chafed and worn with the fatigue of the day, are re∣paired
<PB N="70" REF="68"/>and restored to their natural vigor. While we are awake this cannot so well be done; because the incessant action of the body or mind, being always partial and irregular, prevents that equal distribution of the blood to all parts alike, from which each fibre and filament receives that share or portion that suits it best. In sleep, when it is quiet and natural, all the muscles of the body, that is, all its active powers that are subject to our will, are lulled to rest, composed and relaxed into a genial, temporary kind of palsy, that leaves not the least obstruction or hindrance of the passage of the blood to every atom. Accord∣ingly the pulse is always slower and more equal, the respiration deeper and more regular, and the same degree of vital warmth diffused alike through every part; so that the extre∣mities are equally warm with the heart.</P>
<P>Vexation operating in this manner upon the organs of digestion and concoction, and dis∣turbing and obstructing the natural progress of nutrition, must often produce diseases similar to those of long-continued intemperance; it's first effect being indigestion with all it's symp∣toms,
<PB N="71" REF="69"/>wind, eructation, heart-burn, hiccup, &amp;c. It is no wonder therefore it should some∣times bring on a fit of gout, which, as I have said, is manifestly a disease of crudity and in∣digestion; and often the gout in the stomach and bowels. Indeed most cold crude colics are of this kind. Schirrous concretions will also be formed in the spleen, liver, glands of the mesentery, and throughout the whole sys∣tem of the belly. Many of these indurated tumors will appear outwardly, so as to be felt by the hand; these in time will degenerate in∣to cancers and cancerous ulcerations, and many fatal evils, not the least of which, in my opinion, is, that the patient will suffer a long time be∣fore he dies.</P>
<P>All the passions, when they are inordinate, may have injurious effects upon the vital frame: excessive joy has sometimes given a fatal blow, and sudden bursts of laughter done great mis∣chiefs, especially to delicate or weakly people, who have often been thrown into spasms, cramps, convulsions, hysteric sits and haemor∣rhages by them. But as I think the word Vexation comprehends the chief of those pas∣sions that hurt us most, and mean not to make
<PB N="72" REF="70"/>a metaphysical enquiry about them, it is need∣less to be particular upon each. It may suf∣fice to have shewn the immediate and remote influence of vexation upon die human body.</P>
<P>Whatever men may think of their diseases, their strange symptoms and appearances, and their unaccountable causes, these are the three original great sources of most of the chronic diseases of mankind; which I have endeavored to set forth and explain in so familiar a man∣ner, that I hope I have been perfectly intelli∣gible to every one who will venture to think and judge for himself. To such rational people only I address myself; and to enable them to do this the better, I have furnished these hints and observations, which may be extended, improved and applied to particular cases. I want not, nor wish to obtrude my ideas upon any man, however warranted I may think myself from the observation and experience of my whole life: my principal aim has been only to make men stop a little in their career, and consider with themselves whether it may not be possible for them to be mistaken, even in that course of diet and those habits of life which they never suspected.
<PB N="73" REF="71"/>If they are ill, and for any time, there must be a more substantial cause for it, than they are in general willing to allow. It is not always catching cold, for we do not catch cold so often as we think we do; and when a healthy, robust person takes cold, which can happen but rarely, if this be the whole of the disease, it cannot last long. But the truth is, when the crudity, superfluity and acrimony of an indolent, intemperate life have accumulated to such a degree as to make us sick, then we say we have taken cold, or complain of a bad constitution, when we have spoiled perhaps a very good one; or with Sydenham, that the epidemic constitution of the air has infected us, or that this or that trifle has disagreed. I am fully and firmly persuaded, that whoever will reflect with some degree of intelligence and sanity, be just to himself, and candid with his physician, will in general be able to trace his complaints and diseases up to one or other of these three causes. And whoever does this, must infallibly see how vain and idle all his hopes and expectations of lasting remedy and established health must be from any kind of quack medicines, or indeed the common and too general practice of physic, when the whole
<PB N="74" REF="72"/>is rested upon something given to swallow; how inadequate the means are to the end proposed and hoped for; how ill vomiting and purging can supply the place of tem∣perance; bleeding, blistering and all artificial evacuation, of activity; cordials and opium, of peace of mind. Is not this to fill the body with harsh and unwholsome juices, and then tear it to pieces to get them out again? To make artificial holes and sores in the skin to renew the blood and discharge superfluities, instead of employing muscular motion to rub off and grind down all the acrimony of angu∣lar aculeated particles, and make them smooth and round, and easily divisible; and to em∣ploy intoxication and stupefaction to take off the sense of pain, and leave the cause where it was, or fix it faster? Can any reasonable per∣son hope for health or long life by any of these unnatural methods, when these only are em∣ployed? Let him look round among his neigh∣bors and acquaintance, and tell me whether, not only all the gouty, but rheumatic, colicky, jaundiced, paralytic, dropsical, hysterical people he has ever seen, are not either always so, or by fits so; and whether those returning paroxysms or sits of these disorders do not always grow
<PB N="75" REF="73"/>worse and worse, in spite of all their medication and quackery, till a complication or apoplexy comes on, that at last, though long before their time, puts an end to their miserable lives. These evils are considered as the inheritance of hu∣man nature, unavoidable and incurable, and submitted to in absolute despair; though there has not one rational attempt, that I know of, ever yet been made to remedy them in earnest. All the methods hitherto employed have only been to relieve, and those often so perniciously, that the future health has been sacrificed to obtain present relief or ease. This must for ever be the case when in chronic cases it is ob∣tained by art, and nature has no share; or where the physician does all, and the patient nothing for himself.</P>

<PB N="76" REF="74"/>
<HEAD>Of the Cure of the Gout and all other Chronic Diseases, and the Repair of a broken Constitution.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING set forth the real causes of the gout, and all it's congenial diseases, I come now to the most essential part, to ad∣minister all possible comfort to those whom great pain and long suffering may have made attentive and docile, and willing to take health upon the terms it is possible to have it. To the young and voluptuous, who are yet in their career, and declare for a short life and a merry one, I have nothing to say but this, that a short life is very seldom a merry one; on the contrary, is generally made up of a few years of riotous pleasure without happiness, to be severely paid for by as many more of pain, sick∣ness, regret and despair.</P>
<P>Having shewn that the gout is not heredi∣tary, not inherent in our constitutions, but produced by the daily accumulations of indi∣gested,
<PB N="77" REF="75"/>unsubdued acrimony and superfluity, which, when they abound to a certain degree, must end either in a fit of the gout, or some other disease, according to the constitution, as long as any vigor is left in the body; for nature will for ever free, or endeavor to free itself, and purge the blood of its impurities by gout, by fever, by pain of one kind or other, that takes off the appetite, and for a time gives respite, and prevents the pouring in of more and more enemies to disturb it's operation, and make it ineffectual. Thus young people, after a fit of gout is happily and well gone off, are as free from it, as if they had never had it; and if they would take warning and be careful not to breed it again, most certainly would for ever remain free. How absurd therefore, how ridiculously ignorant must be every at∣tempt to cure the gout <HI>in futuro</HI> by medicine, before it be yet form'd, before it has any ex∣istence! Can such a medicine give superna∣tural strength, and enable an old man living in indolence to digest and consume, or dis∣charge the superfluities of his daily intempe∣rance? that is, to give him more vigorous powers than nature gave him at one-and-twenty, or when the gout came first upon him. The
<PB N="78" REF="76"/>Duke of Portland's powder promised to do something like this, and most certainly kept off the gout for two or three years. But what was it? and what did it really do? It was a strong spicy bitter taken in substance, in a large quantity, for a long time; it's effect was to keep up a constant fever as long as it was taken; this kept the gouty matter always afloat, and prevented it's fixing any where. But there was no living long with a constant fever; accordingly many of those who took it died very soon. I myself observed between fifty and sixty of it's advocates, some my pa∣tients, some my acquaintance or neighbors, who were apparently cured by it for a little while; but in less than six years time, <HI>omnes ad internecionem caesi,</HI> they all died to a man.</P>
<P>Many similar attempts have been made with other medicines to cure not only the gout, but most other chronic diseases, and with the same fatal effects. Antimony and Mercury elaborated into poisons by chemistry have been administered, particularly the solu∣tion of sublimate has torn many a stomach to rags, so that it could never bear common food afterwards. The deadly night-shade, and
<PB N="79" REF="77"/>hemlock, and many such dreadful poisons, have been given as alteratives to restore health. The intention here seems to be, kill or cure, to raise a violent agitation or fever in the body, in hopes it may prove strong enough to throw off the disease and medicine together. The effect has ever been, notwithstanding a little apparent and deceitful relief may have been perceiv'd from the first efforts, that it has sunk under both loads, and, exhausted by re∣peated straining, much sooner than by the dis∣ease alone.</P>
<P>Can any one in his senses suppose that dis∣eases a man has been his whole life contracting, and to which he is adding every day by perse∣verance in unwholsome diet, and bad habits, are to be thus removed by a <HI>coup de main ou de baguette?</HI> or that they will not return, be they cured or conjured away ever so often, whilst he continues the same mode of life that brought them on at first?</P>
<P>What then is to be done? how and in what manner are chronic diseases and cachexies to be cured, and health restored and establesh∣ed? I have already shewn that the causes of
<PB N="80" REF="78"/>these evils are Indolence, Intemperance, and Vexation; and if there be any truth or weight in what I have said, the remedies are obvious. Activity, Temperance and Peace of Mind. It will be said, the remedies are obvious, but impracticable. Would you bid the feeble cripple, who cannot stand, take up his bed and walk? the man who has lost all appetite, abstain? and the sleepless wretch rack'd with pain enjoy peace of mind? No certainly; I am not so absurd. These must be assisted by medicine; and if they have not exhausted all it's power already, a little respite, a favourable interval may be obtained, that, with other arti∣ficial aids co-operating, may be greatly im∣proved to their advantage, and if rightly em∣ployed they may get on from strength to strength, till they recover into perfect health. But it is not my design at present to expatiate upon that particular kind of medical relief which every chronic case may require; it would lead me into too wide a field, and too far from my present purpose, which is to shew that the gout, in most of it's stages and degrees, may be cured, a present paroxysm or fit re∣liev'd, its return for ever safely prevented, and the patient estableshed in perfect health.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="79"/>
<P>Let us suppose the case of a man from forty to fifty years of age, who has had at least twenty fits of gout; by which most of his joints have been so clogg'd and obstructed, as to make walking or any kind of motion very uneasy to him: let him have had it sometimes in his stomach, a little in his head, and often all over him, so as to make him universally sick and low-spirited, especially before a regular fit has come to relieve him. This I apprehend to be as bad a case as we need propose, and that it will not be expected that every old crip∣ple whose joints are burnt to chalk, and his bones grown together and united by anchilosis, who must be carried from his bed to his table and back again, should be proposed as an object of medication and cure; and yet even he might perhaps receive some relief and pal∣liation in pain, if he has any great degree of it, which is not very common in this case. Let us therefore suppose the first example.</P>
<P>If the point be to assuage the violent raging of a present paroxysm; this may be safely done by giving some soft and slowly-operating laxative, neither hot nor cold, but warm, either in small doses repeated so as to move the
<PB N="82" REF="80"/>patient once or twice in twenty-four hours, or by a larger dose oftener in less time, according to the strength and exigency. This may be follow'd by a few lenient absorbent correctors of acrimony or even gentle anodynes: proper cataplasms may also be safely applied to the raging part, which often assuage pain surpriz∣ingly; with as much mild and spontaneously-dissolving nourishment as may keep the spirits from sinking too low: but I would wish them to sink a little, and exhort the patient to bear that lowness with patience and resignation, till nature, assisted by soft and succulent food, can have time to relieve him. This easy me∣thod of treating a fit of the gout would answer in any age; and if the patient was young and vigorous, and the pain violent, there could be no danger in taking away a little blood. Thus in two or three days time I have often seen a severe fit mitigated and made tolerable: and this is a better way of treating it with regard to future consequences, than bearing it with pa∣tience and suffering it to take it's course: for the sooner the joints are relieved from distension and pain, the less danger there is of obstructions fix∣ing in them, or their being calcined and utterly destroyed. But instead of this, the general prac∣tice
<PB N="83" REF="81"/>is quite the reverse. Oh! keep up your spirits, they cry; keep it out of your stomach at all events, where, whenever it rages in a distant part, it is not at all inclined to come. As you cannot eat, you must drink the more freely. So they take cordials, strong wines, and rich spoon-meats. By urging in this manner, a great fever is raised, the pain enraged and prolong∣ed and a fit, that would have ended spon∣taneously in less than a week, protracted to a month or six weeks; and when it goes off at last, leaves such obstruction and weakness in the parts, as cripple the man ever after. All this I hope will be fairly and candidly under∣stood; for there is doubtless a great variety of gouty cases, but no case that will not admit of medical assistance judicioussly administered.</P>
<P>But the most capital point of all, and what is mostly desired by all, is to prevent it's return, or changing into any other disease, and to esta∣blish health. Most men would be very well pleased and happy could this be done by any medical trick or nostrum, with full liberty of living as they list, and indulging every appetite and passion without controul. Some poor silly creatures, ignorant of all philosophy and
<PB N="84" REF="82"/>the nature of causes and effects, have been led into experiments of this kind by a few art∣ful rogues, very much to the prejudice of their future health, and danger of their lives also; expecting from medicine, what it never did or can perform alone, the cure of chronic diseases.</P>
<P>I think it needless here to take any pains to shew the inefficacy of all the common modes of practice, vomiting, purging, bleeding, blis∣tering, issues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They have been found in∣effectual not only in the gout, but all other chronic cases. All sensible practitioners must know their effects to be but temporary, and that they are meant and used only as means of present relief. Let us see therefore by what practicable plan or regimen the person here described, when a fit of the gout is happily ended, may for ever prevent it's return, and so confirm his general health that it shall not again be overset by every slight cold or trifling accident.</P>
<P>I have already shewn that a certain degree of activity or bodily motion is necessary at in∣tervals every day, to raise the circulation to
<PB N="85" REF="83"/>that pitch, that will keep the fine vessels open and the old blood pure, and also make new from the fresh juices. If the patient cannot be brought to this, he has no chance of reco∣vering to perfect health. If therefore he can neither walk nor ride at all, he must by de∣grees be brought to do both by the assistance of others, which may be given him in the following manner: Let a handy active servant or two be employed to rub him all over as he lies in bed with flannels, or flannel gloves, fumigated with gums and spices, which will contribute greatly to brace and strengthen his nerves and fibres, and move his blood without any fatigue to himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This may seem but a trifling prescription to those who have never tried it sufficiently, but is of the utmost consequence, and it's effects are amazing; especially to all those who are too weak to use any muscular motion themselves. A little friction may have little or no effect, but long continued, and repeated often, with fumigated flannels, it will do more to recover health, and support it afterwards, than most other things or methods. It promotes circulation and perspiration, opens the pores, forces the fine vessels, strains and purisies the blood, and this without the assistance of any internal stimulation. It is this that keeps horses in tolerable health with very little exercise.</NOTE>. This may take up from five to ten minutes at first, but must be
<PB N="86" REF="84"/>repeated five or six times a day, supposing him totally unable to help himself. But if he can walk a hundred yards only, it will forward him greatly to walk those hundred yards every two hours, and if he can bear a carriage, let him go out in it every day, till he begins to be tired. The first day or two all this may disturb and fatigue him a little; but if he has patience to persevere to the fourth, I dare pro∣mise him some amendment and increase of strength; which he must employ, as young merchants do a little money, to get more. Thus he must go on rubbing, walking, and riding a little more and more every day, slop∣ping always upon the first sensation of weari∣ness to rest a little, till he be able to walk two or three miles at a stretch, or ride ten without any weariness at all. This is recommended with an intention to dislodge and throw off all remains of crude gouty concretions that may have obstructed his joints, or lain concealed in any of the <HI>lacunae</HI> or recesses of his body; to free the circulation <HI>in minimis,</HI> and all it's se∣cretions, perspirations, and discharges what∣ever: and though this intention can never be but very defectively answered by medicines, it may certainly be assisted and greatly promoted
<PB N="87" REF="85"/>by a few well-chosen mild antimonial, absor∣bent or saponaceous deobstruents and sweetners, that, like putting shot or gravel into a bottle, with a good deal of agitation will greatly help to make it clean, but without agitation will do nothing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Asiatics, understanding luxury much better than we do, and knowing that it is not to be had without some degree of delicate health, do just enough to keep them, in this languid effeminate state, free from pain. Those who are rich among them employ people called Champers to rub, chase and pat them all over at least twice a day, to move their blood and keep their vessels free without any labor or exertion of their own powers. This daily practice in hot countries, where they live in the most slothful indolence, is not only necessary to them, but a great luxury. The Greeks and Romans too, when they became luxurious, fell into habits of this kind, and were strigill'd, and curried, and bathed, and oiled, almost every day.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While we are thus endeavouring to resolve all old obstructions, to open the fine vessels, and strain and purify the blood, and by degrees to enable the man to use a certain degree of exercise or labor every day; great care must be taken in the choice of his diet, that no new acrimony be added to the old, to thwart and frustrate this salutary operation.
<PB N="88" REF="86"/>His food must be soft, mild, and spentane∣ously digesting, and in moderate quantity, so as to give the least possible labor to the stomach and bowels, that it may neither turn sour, nor bitter, nor rancid, nor any way degenerate from those qualities necessary to make good blood. Such things are, at first, new-laid eggs boiled so as not to harden the white creamy part of them, tripe, calves, feet, chicken, par∣tridge, rabbits, most sorts of white mild fish, such as whiting, skate, cod, turbot, &amp;c, and all sorts of shell-fish, particularly oysters raw. Very soon he will be strong enough to eat beef, veal, mutton, lamb, pork, venison, &amp;c. but these must all be kept till they are tender, and eaten with their own gravies without any compounded sauces or pickles whatever: in∣stead of which, boil'd or stew'd vegetables, and sallads of lettuce and endive, may be used: and the luxury that is not unwholsome may be allow'd, light puddings, custards, creams, blanc-manger, &amp;c. and ripe fruits of all kinds and seasons. But because<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have made what inquiries I could upon this capital article from living witnesses; for I do not always pin my faith upon books, knowing it to be no uncom∣mon thing for authors, instead of framing their system from observation and experience, to wrest and explain both to support their opinions. I have been assured by a physician who practised above thirty years in Turkey, that from the Danube to the Euphrates he had never seen a gouty Turk. I have also been informed by some of our ministers who had resided many years at Con∣stantinople, that the gout, and other diseases of the same class, were not uncommon at court; but the courtiers, it seems, were not as good Mahometans as those who lived in the country; for they drank wine, drams, liqueurs of all sorts, without restraint.
<P>I have also been very creadibly informed, that the Gentoos or Marratas, a people of India living in the most temperate simplicity, chiefly upon rice, have no such thing as the gout, or indeed any other chronic disease among them.</P></NOTE> wine undoubtedly
<PB N="89" REF="87"/>produces nine in ten of all the gouts in the world, wine must be avoided, or taken very sparingly, and but seldom. How is this to be done? Can a man used to it every day, who thinks he cannot live without it, and that his existence depends upon it, leave it off safely? If he thinks he must die of the experiment, doing it all at once, he may do it by degrees, and drink but half the quantity of yesterday till he has brought it to nothing. But the danger of attempting it in this manner is, that it will never be done; and, like a procrastinating sin∣ner, he will for ever put off his penitential
<PB N="90" REF="88"/>resolution till to-morrow. If he did it all at once, I would be hanged if he died of the at∣tempt; he would be uneasy for three or four days, that's all. He may change his liquor, and drink a little good porter, or soft ale, and by degrees come to small beer, the wholsomest and best of all liquors except good soft water. I do not mean that this rigorous abstinence from wine is to last for life, but only during the conflict with the disease. As soon as he has recovered health and strength to use exercise enough to subdue it, he may safely indulge once a week, or perhaps twice, with a pint of wine for the sake of good humor and good company, if they cannot be enjoyed without it; for I would not be such a churl as to forbid, or even damp, one of the greatest joys of human life.</P>
<P>If any man should say it is better to have a little gout than take all these pains, and sub∣mit to this discipline: this is not the alterna∣tive, perhaps it may be more eligible to live at large, and have but a little gout now and then, that goes off well, and leaves no trace behind; but this is very seldom the case. The mis∣fortune is, that a little gout most commonly
<PB N="91" REF="89"/>comes again and again more severely, till it becomes a great gout, till it cripples the man, and shortens his life at least twenty years, em∣bittering all the latter part of it. If any one thinks this description of it, which is the real state of the case nine times in ten, preferable to that gradual exertion of his own powers and strictness of regimen, or rather attention to himself, with very moderate abstinence or self-denial for a year or two, as here recommended; I have no reply to make him, but must give him up to his own choice.</P>
<P>The severity of these efforts and this abstemi∣ous care need be continued no longer than the disease or the effects of it remain. When by perseverance in the practice of them, together with the medical aids here recommended, the patient shall have recovered his strength and locomotive powers, he may preserve and per∣petuate them, and make good his title to longevity, upon the following plan.</P>
<P>He must never lose sight of the three great principles of health and long life, Activity, Temperance, and Peace of Mind. With these ever in view, he may eat and drink of every
<PB N="92" REF="90"/>thing the earth produces, but his diet must be plain, simple, solid and tender, or in propor∣tion to his consumption; he must eat but of one thing or two at most at a meal, and this will soon bring him to be satisfied with about half his usual quantity; for all men eat about twice as much as they ought to do, provoked by variety: he must drink but little of any liquor, and never till he has done eating: the drier every man's diet is, the better. No wine oftener than once or twice a week at most; and this must be considered as a luxuri∣ous indulgence, If he be sometimes led una∣wares into a debauch, it must be expiated by abstinence and double exercise the next day, and he may take a little of my magnesia and rhubarb as a good antidote: or if he cannot sleep with his unusual load, he may drink water, and with his finger in his throat throw it up. I have known some old soldiers by this trick alone, never taking their dose to bed with them, live to kill their acquaintance two or three times over. One moderate meal a day is abundantly sufficient; therefore it is better to omit supper, because dinner is not so easily avoided. Instead of supper, any good ripe fruit of the season would be very salutary, pre∣venting
<PB N="93" REF="91"/>costiveness, and keeping the bowels free and open, cooling, correcting, and carrying off the heats and crudities of his in∣digestion.</P>
<P>His activity need be no more than to per∣severe in the habit of rubbing all over night and morning for eight or ten minutes, and walking three or four miles every day, or rid∣ing ten, or using any bodily labor or exercise equivalent to it. In bad weather I can see no great evil in throwing a cloak round his shoul∣ders and walking even in the rain; the only difficulty is to summon resolution enough to venture out; and a little use would take off all danger of catching cold, by hardening and securing him against the possibility of it upon that and all other occasions. If he dares not risque this, some succedaneum must be used within doors; more especially when bad wea∣ther continues any time. I recommend it to all men to wash their feet every day, the gouty in particular, and not to lie a-bed above seven hours in summer, and eight in winter.</P>
<P>Whoever thinks there cannot be luxury enough in this course of life, I am persuaded
<PB N="94" REF="92"/>will not find more in any other: for good health, with all it's natural appetites and sen∣sations in perfect order, is the only true foun∣dation of luxury. And whoever cultivates it upon the false principles of culinary or medical art, urging to excess by stimulating provoca∣tives of any kind, instead of pleasure and en∣joyment, will meet with pain and disgust.</P>
<P>Some pehaps may be reasonable enough to observe and say, This plan of yours is very simple; there is nothing marvellous in it; no wonderful discovery of any of the latent powers of medicine; but will a regimen, so easy to be comply'd with as this, cure the gout, stone, dropsy, &amp;c.? Will it repair broken constitutions and restore old invalids to health? My answer is, that if I may trust the experi∣ence of my whole life, and above all the ex∣perience I have had in my own person, hav∣ing not only got rid of the gout, of which I have had four severe fits in my younger days, but also emerged from the lowest ebb of life, that a man could possibly be reduced to by cholic, jaundice, and a complication of com∣plaints, and recovered to perfect health; which I have now uninterruptedly enjoyed above ten
<PB N="95" REF="93"/>years: I say, if I may rely upon all this I may with great safety pronounce and promise that the plan here recommended, assisted at first with all the collateral aids of medicine peculiar to each case, correcting many an un∣toward concomitant symptom, pursued with resolution and patience, will certainly procure to others the same benefits I received from it, and cure every curable disease. If this be thought too much to promise, I beg it may be considered, that a life of bad habits produces all these diseases: nothing therefore so likely as good ones long continued to restore or pre∣serve health.</P>
<P>What can the best physician do more than discover and point out to his patients the real causes of their diseases? You will say, he must find a remedy: this he will do for you also as long as he can. But I will tell you a secret: his remedies are chiefly evacuations; and as long as your body can bear scouring and cleansing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paracelsus was a good chemist, but a miserable phy∣sician: he invented that medicine which he most ridicu∣lously called <HI>Elixir proprietatis;</HI> and from it's efficacy, sot as he was, promised himself the years of Me∣thusalem. At first it did wonders, scoured and carried off all his crapulary indigestions, and kept him some time in health and spirits; but trusting to it too long, and repeating it too often, it not only lost all it's power of doing good, but hurt him greatly, and he died I think at six-and-thirty, notwithstanding his Elixir.</NOTE>
<PB N="96" REF="94"/>he will do you some temporary apparent service: but when it begins to wear out, his remedies will answer no longer; you must try better methods; you must not repeat the cause so often; for he cannot for ever build up as fast as you can pull down. In short, you must reform your life, and change all your bad habits for good ones; and if you have patience to wait the slow operations of nature properly assisted, you will have no reason to regret your former luxuries.</P>
<P>We are all so much the creatures of habit, which forms and fashions us to good or ill almost as much as nature itself, that we ought to be very attentive and careful that our daily habits may ever tend to the confirmation, not the destruction of health. It is not what we do now and then that can injure us greatly, but what we do every day must either do us great good or harm; either establishing our health, or fixing our diseases, for life.</P>
<PB N="97" REF="95"/>
<P>If, after all, any man should say, these restraints, this care in chusing what is whol∣some, this constant watching over all we do, would make life so grievous, that health were not worth having upon these terms; I wish him to slop a little, and consider them well before he rejects them intirely; and whether there be any better for him. It can do him no great harm to try a month or two; if he does, I flatter myself he will find that custom will take off the greatest part of the grievance, and perseverance make them not only tolerable but pleasant. If he thinks health may be enjoyed upon easier terms, I fear he will be miserably deceived; for health, like beauty, may be won by our own attention, efforts, and assiduities, but cannot be had by purchase. Whoever thinks to buy either, will have the misfortune to find it not long his own, though he has paid for it.</P>
<P>But there may be others whom long suffer∣ing has made more patient and reasonable; these may be glad to hear that a little health is to be had on any terms; and it may be very comfortable to them to know that there
<PB N="98" REF="96"/>is scarcely any state of weakness so low, sup∣posing the vitals not mortally hurt, from which they may not recover into very desir∣able health and strength, and by these means, exerted with persevering patience. I say this to invalids in general: for thus may be cured not only the gout, but very bad rheu∣tisms, ischiaticas, rickets, stone, jaundice, dropsy, asthma, cachexies, and complications of many kinds; not excepting even cancers, if they are not too far gone: for a cancer is nothing more than a place where nature deposits the bad humors of the blood, as appears by its almost constant return to some other part after extirpation. Whatever chronic disease will not give way to this system of medication, will be found, I greatly fear, too hard for any other. And should there be a particular case, in which some fortunate violence or chance may have ap∣parently succeeded for a time, the return of the evil, or change to something worse, can no way be so well guarded against and prevented, as by some such rational and natural institution of life.</P>
<PB N="99" REF="97"/>
<P>Thus have I endeavored to set forth the real causes of chronic diseases in general, and the true principles of convalescence, health, and longevity. If I have hazarded any thing new, or contrary to received opi∣nions, it has been from a thorough con∣viction of it's truth, however dangerous to fame and fortune; both which I know are more easily acquired by complying with the world, than attempting to reform it: but it must be somebody equally indifferent to both, as I am, who will venture to tell such truths as are more likely to recoil and hurt the author, than to convince and conciliate the bulk of mankind.</P>
