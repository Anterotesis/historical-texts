<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD long suspected that the Peruvian Bark in common use, was very inferior in power and efficacy to that recommended by the early writers on the subject; but, more especially by our countrymen, <HI>MORTON</HI> and <HI>SYDENHAM,</HI> in whose works the medical virtues of this Drug, in Intermittent and other Fevers are extolled as little short of infallibility. In their time the Quill Bark was not mentioned; their cotemporary writers on the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> evidently describe the Peruvian Bark of that period, as of a larger kind, of more com∣pact pieces, and of the colour of the rust of <HI>Iron,</HI> which marks are very expressive of the <HI>Red Bark,;</HI> the in∣nermost coat of which has an <HI>ochry</HI> appearance, and its resinous or middle layer resembles very much the <HI>La∣pis Haematitis.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortex crassitie mediocri, foras scaber, paululum canescens, aliquando musco obductus, intus laevis, coloris ferruginei, sapo∣ris acris at intense amari.

<P>Dalei Pharmacologia. p. 201. Anno 1692.</P>
<P>Mr. SPRINGALL of <HI>Thames Street,</HI> (whose Uncle was, in the the year 1702, with SIR GEORGE ROOKE, at the taking of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Galleons, in the harbour of <HI>Vigo</HI> in <HI>Gallicia</HI>) had a quantity of Peruvian Bark, which was part of the plun∣der brought home at that time. It was bought, about four years ago, by Mr. PEARSON, an Apothecary in <HI>Spital Square,</HI> who as∣sured me that it was the Red Bark: its Decoction was much stronger than that of the Common Bark, and he found it very efficacious in the cure of Fevers and other Diseases. This seems a collateral proof of the Red Bark being early in use.</P></NOTE> <HI>M. LA CONDAMINE</HI> expressed his
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>surprise, when he was told by Mr. <HI>THOMAS BLACHYN∣DEN,</HI> Director of the <HI>English</HI> South Sea Compa∣ny, at <HI>Panama,</HI> that the writers on <HI>Pharmacy</HI> and <HI>Materia Medica</HI> in <HI>England</HI> had preferred the Small and Quill Bark, while the inhabitants of <HI>New Spain,</HI> held the larger Bark in higher estimation.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They commonly reckon three species of the <HI>Quinquina,</HI> tho some make four; the white, the yellow, and the red: I was told at <HI>Loxa,</HI> that these three kinds differ in their virtue only; the white having scarce any virtue, and the red excelling the yellow.
<P>The trees from whence the first Bark was taken, which were very large, are all dead, having been entirely stripped, which infallibly ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls them when they come to be old. Expe∣rience has shewn that stripping kills some of the young ones also, but the greatest part escape. For this operation they use a common knife, which they hold in both hands; the barker sticks it into the Bark as high as he can reach, and so draws it downwards as low as he can. It does not appear that the trees which grow where the old ones stood, have less virtue than they, the situation and soil being the same; the difference, if there be any, may arise, perhaps, from the different ages of the trees. Few but young ones are now to be met with: I do not remember to have seen any much thicker than my arm, or a∣bove 12 or 15 feet high; those which are cut young, shoot forth new branches from the stumps.</P>
<P>I was informed at <HI>Loxa,</HI> that heretofore, they preferred the coarsest Bark, and laid it by as a rarity, but now the finest is most esteemed: the merchants may possibly find their account in it, as it takes up less room in packing. But a director of the <HI>English</HI> South Sea Company at <HI>Panama.</HI> through which all the <HI>Quinquina</HI> that comes to <HI>Europe</HI> must pass, assured me, that the preference given at present to the fine Bark, is in consequence of several chymical analyses and experiments which have been made on both sorts in <HI>England.</HI> It seems probable, that the difficulty of thoroughly drying the large coarse bark, and the humidity it is naturally apt to contract and retain, has hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to bring it into disrepute. Vulgar prejudice will have it, that to lose nothing of its virtue, the tree should be barked in the moon's decrease, and on the east side. These circumstances, as also its being gathered on the mountain of <HI>Cajanuma,</HI> were cer∣tified by a notary in 1735. where the marquis de <HI>Castelfuerte</HI> procured a quantity of <HI>Quinquina</HI> from <HI>Loxa,</HI> to carry to <HI>Spain</HI> on his return. Memoir de l'Acad. d. Sc. 1738.</P></NOTE> I can only explain such a preference from this circumstance,
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>that the larger pieces of Bark which were imported into this country along with the smaller Bark, were either of a <HI>fibrous, spongy,</HI> or <HI>ligneous</HI> texture; or, probably damaged by moisture, and taken from decayed trees.</P>
<P>Druggists have sometimes suggested this as an argu∣ment against the use of the present Bark, and many pro∣bably endeavour to oppose its introduction, until the quan∣tity in the markets be greater, and more equally divided
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>among them▪ or until they have been able to dispose of the large quantity of common Bark they have in their warehouses.</P>
<P>The <HI>taste</HI> and <HI>flavour</HI> of the <HI>Red Bark</HI> is more difficultly evolved▪ and is therefore at first not so obv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous from the closeness of its texture, and from the resinous coat being so well defended and inclosed between other two layers. It is evidently heavier thin any other kind of Bark, and seems to have been prepared and dried with g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eater attenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, its original appearance and form being better preserved.</P>
<P>I think it probable from a more attentive view of the subject that it may be the Bark of the trunk of the tree, and I am the more confirmed in this opinion by the ideas of my friends <HI>Dr. WITHERING</HI> and <HI>Dr. FO∣THERGILL,</HI> conveyed in their letters to me; in which, they observe that the essential and active parts of the Oak Bark are more intire, and in larger quantity in the trunk and larger branches, than in the twigs or smaller branches, which are comparatively of an im∣perfect growth, perhaps the Small and Quilled Bark may be procured from younger trees not yet arrived at
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>their full maturity and therefore yielding a Bark of a weaker quality.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. ARROT, a Scotch Surgeon who had gathered the Bark in the place where it grows, says that the small curled Bark so much esteemed in England is the Bark of younger Trees, which frequently recover the Barking, while the old∣er Trees never do. This affords a strong proof that the early Bark introduced into Europe was of the larger kind and from the older Trees, while the difficulty of procuring it, has been the means of introducing a smaller and younger Bark. Mr. ARROT, and all other Travellers agree, in preferring the Red Bark to any other.
<P>Encyclopaedia. Cortex. Vol. I.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>If the execution of this work was equal to its impor∣tance, it would challenge the attention of the public, in a degree far above most medical subjects. This will be unquestionably admitted by those who have been eye witn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses to the fatality and malignancy of <HI>intermit∣tent</HI> and <HI>remittent Fevers</HI> in every part of the globe, but more especially in warm climates; this fatality is by no means owing to the ignorance or unskifulness of the practitioners in those countries, but to the inefficacy of the Common Bark in general use.</P>
<P>The numbers, who fall a sacrifice to the <HI>Epidemic</HI> and <HI>Seasoning Fevers</HI> of <HI>warm Climates,</HI> are admit∣ted
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>infinitely to exceed those who are destroyed by the Ene∣my. In almost all the dangerous Fevers which occur in our <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West India Settlements,</HI> the Bark is a principal <HI>Remedy.</HI></P>
<P>I think it therefore an object of the greatest national importance, that our <HI>Fleets</HI> and <HI>Armies</HI> should be li∣berally supplied with this Bark which will seldom or ever disappoint them. I have been told by a Druggist, that its great <HI>activity</HI> rendered it a dangerous remedy, my answer was that wine mixed with water was much safer in the hands of an unskilful practitioner, than wine alone, but that did not prove that wine was not a better cordial than water. The s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me reasoning may be ap∣plied to prove, that weak and decayed remedies, by being much milder in their operations, are therefore preferable to such as are more perfect of their kind. I believe the general and best founded complaint is against the want of power and efficacy of Bark, and not that it is too powerful and active. In proof of this I refer my Readers to the Letters annexed, which evidently demon∣strate that such was the stubborness and obstinacy of the
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/><HI>Intermittent Fevers</HI> of this year, even in this country, that they resisted common Bark, and only gave way to the <HI>Red Bark.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding I formed very early a favourable opinion of this Bark, yet it fell far short of that which I am now justified in maintaining from the collected evidence of so many Gentlemen in distant and remote parts of the country. Many letters which I have re∣ceived are wrote with such zeal in favour of its supe∣rior efficacy, that they could only be dictated by the strong∣est conviction arising from extensive and diligent ob∣servations.</P>
<P>I have persuaded many of my Medical friends to use the <HI>Red Bark</HI> in our foreign settlements, and, shall take pleasure in communicating to the public the result of their observations so soon as I am favoured with them. A more powerful Bark is particularly desireable in those countries, where the violence and danger of the paroxysm is so great. In the following observations, I have confined myself very much to the use of the Red
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>Bark in febrile Diseases, but I am in possession of many facts in proof of its superior powers in other diseases in which the common Peruvian Bark has been found useful.</P>
<P>The public may be always assured of the fidelity of my observations, and that my only motive is that of rest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring to general use a <HI>remedy</HI> which was found so efficacious by <HI>MORTON</HI> and <HI>SYDENHAM,</HI> and which in the hands skilful Physicians may be considered as an antidote to the fatal influence of <HI>Marshy Grounds</HI> and <HI>Unhealthy Climates.</HI></P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1779, a Spanish Ship from <HI>Lima,</HI> bound to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> was taken by the <HI>Hussar Frigate</HI> and carried into <HI>Lisbon;</HI> her cargo consisted chiefly of this Bark, a part of which was afterwards brought into this country, and purchased by several Druggists in <HI>London.</HI> It is of so large a kind, and has so coarse an appearance, that it was with much dif∣ficulty they could prevail on Medical Practitioners to prescribe it. Its reputation was first established by trials made in the public Hospitals, and its superior efficacy has been well ascertained by the most attentive observation.</P>
<PB N="ii" REF="14"/>
<P>In the following pages are contained some very in∣teresting matters of fact, which will throw much light on the choice of this drug, and on the general applica∣tion of Bark in the cure of Agues and other Fevers. Altho' the general title, by which it was sold, was that of <HI>Quinquina,</HI> yet it was supposed by our Druggists to be a new medicine. They called it the red Bark; it appears however, both from an attention to its sensi∣ble qualities and the information procured from <HI>Spain,</HI> that it is the true <HI>Peruvian Bark,</HI> of a quality probably superior to any ever known in this country. This fact is farther proved by its being found sometimes in small detached pieces amongst other Bark, it seems however hitherto to have escaped our particular notice.</P>
<P>The Author highly sensible of the difficulty of estab∣lishing facts either on the effects of remedies, or on any branch of medicine which regards the Animal Oeco∣nomy, has solicited the opinion of many ingenious and attentive practitioners, who from their situation have had frequent opportunities of trying the Red Bark.
<PB N="iii" REF="15"/>This caution appeared the more necessary, because he is well persuaded that the love of novelty, and too great a credulity in admitting false facts, on very doubtful au∣thorities, have corrupted medicine more than any other Science, and proved more injurious than the most ab∣surd and fanciful theories, the errors of which are easily detected.</P>

<HEAD>Of its Natural History.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the Bark of a Tree which grows in the neighbourhood of <HI>Loxa</HI> chiefly on the mountain of <HI>Cajanuma.</HI> It is propagated spontaneously. The tree is seldom more than <HI>fifteen</HI> feet high. Its trunk and branches of a proportional thickness. The Bark is carefully cut off in the dry season, and gently dried by the heat of the Sun, before it is packed for foreign use. It has been distinguished into the white, yellow and red, the last is generally preferred, but they are only to be considered as varieties of the same tree, depending on soil, expo∣sure and other accidental circumstances. Perhaps the age of the tree and the size of it branches, from whence the Bark is taken, as well as the care and attention bestowed in the preparing it, may in∣fluence its powers and efficacy. I am persua∣uaded
<PB N="2" REF="17"/>that the Bark of which we are now treat∣ing is the <HI>"Cinchona officinalis Linn. Sp. pl.</HI> 244 <HI>mat. Med.</HI> 71 <HI>Quinquina De la Condamine Memoir del' Acad. d. Sc.</HI> 1738 <HI>p.</HI> 226 <HI>t.</HI> 5 <HI>fig. A. E. &amp; t.</HI> 6 <HI>f. F.</HI> S.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Old Spain</HI> always preferred the larger Bark, and from the account of travel∣lers, I am disposed to believe that more attention is paid in collecting and drying the Bark which is consumed in <HI>Spain,</HI> than what is brought to a fo∣reign market. I hope that the information which I shall give on this subject will stimulate Druggists to procure the Red Peruvian Bark, and remove the prejudices which have prevailed against so large a Bark in favour of the small, thin, and quilled Bark, hitherto the subject of their choice.</P>
<P>This Red Bark is very distinguishable from those large coarse woody and fibrous masses, oc∣casionally mixed with the common Peruvian Bark.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="18"/>
<HEAD>Of its Sensible Qualities.</HEAD>
<P>THE Red Bark is in much larger and thicker pieces than the common Peruvian Bark. It evi∣dently consists of three distinct layers. The exter∣nal thin, rugged, and frequently covered with a mossy substance, and of a reddish brown colour. The middle, thicker, more compact, and of a dark∣er colour. In this appears chiefly to reside its re∣sinous part, being extremely brittle, and evidently containing a larger quantity of inflammable mat∣ter than any other kind of Bark.</P>
<P>The innermost has a more woody and fibrous appearance, of a brighter red than the former.</P>
<P>The intire piece breaks in that brittle manner described by writers on the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> as a proof of the superiour excellence of the Bark.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="19"/>
<P>In reducing it to powder, the middle layer, which seems to contain the greatest proportion of Resin, will not give way to the pestle so easily as the other layers; this should be particularly at∣tended to when it is used in fine powder. Its flavour is chiefly discoverable either in powder or solution, is evidently more aromatic, and has a greater degree of bitterness than the common Bark.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT, I.</HEAD>
<P>To an ounce of red Bark, reduced to a fine pow∣der, were added <HI>sixteen</HI> ounces of distilled water; and, after remaining together <HI>twenty-four</HI> hours in a florence flask, the liquid was carefully filtered. The same experiment was made with the Peruvian Bark commonly in use.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="20"/>
<P>The colour of the two infusions was very differ∣ent, that made with the Red Bark being much deeper. The taste and flavour of the infusion of the red Bark were considerably more powerful than of the other. In the opinion of many Gentlemen who tasted the infusions, the cold infusion of the red Bark was more sensibly impregnated than even the strongest decoction of the common Bark.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT II.</HEAD>
<P>To two ounces of the cold infusion of the red Bark, were added <HI>twenty</HI> drops of the <HI>Tinctura Flo∣rum Martialium.</HI> It immediately became of a dark∣er colour, soon lost its transparency, and after a short time precipitated a black powder.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="experiment">

<P>To two ounces of the cold infusion of the com∣mon Bark, were added <HI>twenty</HI> drops of the <HI>Tinctura

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT IV.</HEAD>
<P>To an ounce of red Bark, reduced to a coarse powder, were added <HI>sixteen</HI> ounces of distilled water, and after boiling until one half was evapo∣rated, the liquid while hot was strained thro' a piece of linen. The same experiment under simi∣lar circumstances, was made with the common Bark. The superiour taste and flavour of the de∣coction of the red Bark was equally observable with that in the infusion. The decoction of the red Bark, under cooling, precipitated a larger quantity of resinous matter than the decoction of the com∣mon Bark. The difference of colour was likewise very distinguishable.</P>

<HEAD>EXPERIMENT V.</HEAD>
<P>To an ounce of red Bark, reduced to a coarse powder, were added <HI>eight</HI> ounces of proof spirit, and, after standing a week together, the Tincture was filtered.</P>
<P>The same experiment, under similar circum∣stances, was made with the common Bark. The Tincture of the red Bark, both when tasted by it∣self and under precipitation by water, had more flavour and taste than that of the common Bark.</P>
<P>The Tincture from the red Bark is of a much deeper colour than the other.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT VI.</HEAD>
<P>To each <HI>residuum</HI> of the above Tinctures were added <HI>eight</HI> ounces of proof spirit, which were in∣fused in a moderate sand heat for the space of <HI>twenty four hours,</HI> and afterwards allowed to remain to∣gether
<PB N="8" REF="23"/>a week, occasionally agitating them. The Tinctures were then poured off, that of the red Bark evidently appearing to be the strongest.</P>
<P>The Tinctures both of Experiments 5. and 6. were by a gentle hen evaporated to the consist∣ance of a resinous extract.</P>
<P>The Extract from the Tincture of the red Bark was of a smooth homogeneous appearance, not un∣like the Balsam of Peru, when thickened: The flavour and taste of the original Tincture were in∣tirely preserved in it.</P>
<P>The Extract from the common Bark had a very different appearance. It seemed coarse and gritty, and by no means so characteristic of its original tincture.</P>
<P>The quantity of extract procured from the red Bark was considerably more than from the same
<PB N="9" REF="24"/>quantity of common Bark; but, as the <HI>residuum</HI> of neither was rendered entirely inert, the abso∣lute quantity could not be ascertained.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To 26 lb. of red Bark were added 26 Gallons of proof spirit, after remaining together for some time the Tincture was poured off, and submitted to a distillation in a water bath, the quantity of spiritous extract obtain∣ed was lb. 12 ½ a quantity of water being poured on the <HI>residuum</HI> of the Tincture, the watery extract obtain∣ed was lb. 4.
<P>In another experiment, with lb. 30 of red Bark, treat∣ed in the same manner as the former, only lb. 11 ½ of spiritous extract was procured, and lb. 4 ½ of watery extract.</P>
<P>The best Peruvian Bark hitherto in use gives from lb. 6 ½ to 7 ½ lb. of spiritous extract.</P></NOTE></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT VII.</HEAD>
<P>A tea spoonful of each of the tinctures, prepared by experiment 5th. was added to <HI>two</HI> ounces of water: the resinous precipitation from the red Bark was not only more copious, but fell more
<PB N="10" REF="25"/>quickly to the bottom of the glass than the other, and yet, what remained still dissolved in the water, was infinitely more in the red Bark than the com∣mon Bark, so far as we could judge from the taste and flavour of both.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT VIII.</HEAD>
<P>In imitation of the experiments of my ingeni∣ous Friend Dr. PERCIVAL, I added to <HI>two</HI> ounces of the watery infusion of each Bark a few drops of the <HI>Sp.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT IX.</HEAD>
<P>A decoction of both red and common Peruvian Bark was prepared by taking an ounce of each and boiling them in a pint and a half of water, to <HI>one</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="26"/>pint; the former had greatly the superiority in strength and power as mentioned in a preceding experiment. A pint of fresh water was added to each decoction; the boiling still continued 'till that quantity was evaporated. The decoction of the common Peruvian Bark seemed gradually to lose its sensible qualities while that of the red Bark still retained its own.</P>
<P>The same quantity of water was added as before to each, and the decoction repeated untill a gallon of water was exhausted; at the expiration of which time, the common Peruvian Bark was rendered almost tasteless; the red Bark still retaining nearly its former sensible qualities. This experiment proves that the common practice of boiling the Bark is hurt-full to its powers.</P>
<P>The conclusions to which the above experi∣ments evidently lead, are
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>1st.</HI> That the red Bark is more soluble than the Peruvian Bark, both in water and spirit.</ITEM>
<PB N="12" REF="27"/>
<ITEM><HI>2ly.</HI> That it contains a much larger proportion of active and resinous parts.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>3ly.</HI> That its active parts, even when greatly diluted, retain their sensible qualities in a higher degree than the most saturated solutions of com∣mon Bark.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>4ly.</HI> That it does not undergo the same decom∣position of its parts by boiling as the common Per∣uvian Bark.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The advantages therefore to be expected from the red Bark cannot be obtained from any quantity of common Bark. The best common Bark, com∣pared with the red Bark, appears inert and effete.</P>
<P>All the above experiments were executed in the presence of several Gentlemen.</P>
<P>I was led more particularly to prosecute this subject, from ah opinion that the red Bark might sufficiently impregnate cold water by infusion, so
<PB N="13" REF="28"/>as to cure intermittent fevers with more certainty than could be done even by the decoction or pow∣der of common Bark. The sensible qualities which appear from the above experiments, being so much greater, in the cold infusion of the one than in the decoction of the other.</P>
<P>As a proof of the superior antiseptic power of the red Bark, both its cold infusion and decoction preserved entire their bitter and other medicated powers, while the infusion and decoction of the common Bark, prepared at the same time, had alto∣gether lost their sensible qualities.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the month of <HI>June,</HI> a large quantity of the de∣coction of red Bark, which had been kept for <HI>five</HI> weeks in the Elaboratory of GUYS HOSPITAL, was equally good at the expiration of that time, as when first pre∣pared; while a decoction of common Bark, gave evi∣dent appearances of a change in a few days.
<P>In the decoction of the red Bark the powder which is seperated during the cooling of it, remains intimately diffured thro' Liquor, so that it continues loaded, and turbid while at rest. In the decoction of common Bark, it seperates and easily subsides to the Bottom.</P></NOTE></P>
<PB N="14" REF="29"/>
<P>It seems reasonable to hope that the introduction of this kind of Bark may be attended with the hap∣piest effects, and enable us to oppose more suc∣cessfully those malignant and remittent fevers of warm climates, and unfavourable situations, so de∣structive to our fleets and armies.</P>

<P>The following remarks are intended to apply to the Peruvian Bark, generally in use; but I am cer∣tain that the effects enumerated are found to be produced in a much higher degree by the red Bark.</P>
<P>The cold infusion of Bark seems evidently to promote both appetite and digestion, it increases the tone and action of the stomach, by which the Gas∣tric
<PB N="15" REF="30"/>liquor, the great <HI>Menstruum</HI> of our solid ali∣ment, is more perfectly prepared.</P>
<P>In most cases, the Bark rather promotes costive∣ness, the common effect of strong and vigorous in∣testines. In very large doses however it proves purgative, but this effect ceases after a short time.</P>
<P>It renders the pulse stronger and fuller in health, and in most diseases unaccompained with fever.</P>
<P>In low and malignant fevers, and more especially under remission, it renders the pulse stronger and even flower.</P>
<P>In particular circumstances of fever marked with debility and a tendency to remission, tho' of a very irregular type, it deminishes febrile heat.</P>
<P>It encreases the animal heat and aggravates every Symptom, in fevers accompanied either with much local inflammation, or a general inflammatory di∣athesis, which is strongly indicated by the pulse the manner of the original attack, the want of due
<PB N="16" REF="31"/>freedom in the secretions, and the painful and op∣pressive exercise of every function.</P>
<P>It checks profuse and colliquative discharges, especially those by the skin, while it does not seem to diminish insensible perspiration, or other na∣tural evacuations.</P>
<P>It checks every tendency to putrefaction or gan∣grene, occurring under circumstances of debility, but if may promote both, if injudiciously employ∣ed, while the action of the system is too violent, or the inflammatory diathesis is too prevalent. It seems more resonable to refer its action, as an an∣tiseptic, to its tonic power on the moving system, than to any primary action on the animal fluids.</P>
<P>Perhaps this doctrine will apply in explaining the history of remedies used in the Scurvy, a dis∣ease invited and avoured by every means which can induce debility, and evidently preceded by symp∣toms of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nished <HI>vis vitoe</HI> which necessarily lead
<PB N="17" REF="32"/>to others that in a secondary manner only take place in the animal fluids.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="marg">An Enquiry into the source from whence the symp∣toms of Scurvy and of putrid diseases arise by Dr. MIL∣MAN.</NOTE></P>
<P>It promotes under many circumstances a favour∣able suppuration and improves the nature of san∣ious and ichorous discharges.</P>
<P>Its action here can only be explained from its general tonic power, for either general or local de∣bility retards suppuration and favours the obstinacy of ill conditioned ulcers.</P>
<P>Upon the same principle its power of promoting the suppuration, and generation of true <HI>pus</HI> in the small pox may be explained.</P>
<P>The period of debility is that only in which the Bark should be employed.</P>
<P>I have seen patients under the most confluent Small Pox require Bark in the progress of suppur∣ation,
<PB N="18" REF="33"/>and yet, in the more advanced state of the dis∣case, the same persons have been saved by the season∣able and repeated use of the Lancet in the secon∣dary Fever, which attacked with fresh rigors and inflammatory symptoms of a true Peripneumony.</P>
<P>In delicate and irritable habits, which seem more especially to favour scrophulous affections, and which produce inflammation of a peculiar nature, that gives way sooner to tonics than evacuants, the Bark has been found the best remedy: This may probably admit of the explanation already given on the subject of Scurvy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of its use in the Cure of In∣termittent Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>What I have to offer on this subject is the re∣sult of careful and diligent observation, totally un∣connected
<PB N="19" REF="34"/>with prejudice of any kind, ill favour of any particular theory, or a blind attachment to sys∣tem.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the cautious and timid practiti∣oner has very generally forbid the use of Bark un∣til evacuations should have been made; I am very well persuaded from observation that in inter∣mittent fevers, such as rage and are endemic, par∣ticurlarly in low and marshy situations, and such as frequently occur on the banks of the Thames, and the lower parts of this metropolis the Bark cannot be given too early, the use of either emetics or purgatives, as preparatory, is not only unneces∣sary, but in some cases productive of more debility, and therefore to be avoided.</P>
<P>The doctrine of concoction however just it may be in continued fevers, and in some cases of inflam∣mation, does not apply in intermittents produced by the <HI>Miasmata</HI> of low and swampy grounds, and which afford the principal source of agues in the environs of this City.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="35"/>
<P>In this opinion I am confirmed by the testimony of Dr. CLEGHORN and others; who frequently found it necessary to give it on the first accession of the disease in order effectually to obviate, or weaken the return of a second paroxysm, which in many cases would inevitably have proved fatal, and Dr. LIND has very properly observed that such symptoms from visceral obstructions, which have been attributed to Bark, are rather the effect of the paroxysm being allowed to return, from the omission of that medicine.</P>
<P>There are many symptoms which would forbid the use of Bark, did they occur distinct and inde∣pendent of intermittent fever, such as cough, diffi∣culty of breathing and pain in the side: they are frequently brought on by the paroxysm of the in∣termittent, and only give way to the use of the Bark by which that paroxysm may be prevented. Such symptoms do not admit of a distinct and separate treatment, but are always aggravated by the use of Evacuants, more especially bleeding, the most pro∣bable
<PB N="21" REF="36"/>means of relieving in common depuratory fevers.</P>
<P>I have sometimes found a complication of In∣termittent and Hectic fever in the same person, and could distinguish between the paroxysms of each: the Bark while it cured the intermittent, has even moderated the Hectic; tho' Hectic fever of itself, especially as a symptom of <HI>Phthisis Pulmon∣alis</HI> does not appear to give way at any time un∣der the use of the Bark; I think it probable, there∣fore, that altho' in the treatment of intermittents complicated with other diseases, our chief attention should be first directed to the cure of the intermit∣tent, yet it may be necessary to pursue an indicati∣on that may have in view the other disorders, not incompatible with the treatment of the intermittent. In dropsies, which accompany intermittents, I have found more benefit from the use of Bark, joined to the neutral salts, and other mild diuretics, than from active purgatives, which always tend to pro∣tract the intermittent. Every returning paroyxsin
<PB N="22" REF="37"/>of an ague confirms more and more the cause of that disease which it has produced.</P>
<P>It is not intended to insinuate that no cases do occur, in which it may not be prudent to administer a vomit, especially to persons subject to bilious accu∣mulations in the stomach: but this is more with a view of removing an obstacle to the operation of Bark, than as necessary to render it safe, and I have frequently seen <HI>nausea</HI> and vomiting so much a symptom of the paroxysm, that they gave way only to the free use of Bark itself.</P>
<P>A practice more absurd than that of preceding evacuations has been adopted and recommended. <HI>viz.</HI> that of evacuating by purgatives after the cure had been compleated by the Bark, this seldom fails of bringing back the intermittent, as one cause of inducing debility, the most favourable state of the body for the attack of intermittent fevers.</P>
<P>In persons who are rendered costive by the use of the Bark, I would recommend the common
<PB N="23" REF="38"/>practice of giving a few grains of Rhubarb, or <HI>Pilul. Rufi.</HI> If on the other hand it should prove pur∣gative, a few drops of the <HI>Thebaic Tincture</HI> is the usual and best means of checking that operation.</P>
<P>Intermittent fevers are frequently so very ano∣malous in their appearances and assume so much the character of other diseases that an unskilful, or an inattentive practitioner may be deceived; they however, under any form or any type, generally give way to the Bark; sometimes aided and assist∣ed by other means.</P>
<P>Both the Vernal and Autumnal intermittents of Dr. SYDENHAM yield to it, the latter however sometimes with more obstinacy than the former.</P>
<P>In several cases I have experienced the superior efficacy of the red Bark in removing <HI>Tertians</HI> and <HI>Quartans</HI> which had resisted the common Bark, this however is not to be wondered at, when we consider the diversity in the power even of differ∣ent kinds of the common Bark in general use.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="39"/>
<P>I hope I shall be excused in digressing so far, as to mention the useful effects I have frequently ex∣perienced from the exhibition of Opium in inter∣mittent fevers. We are chiefly indebted for this practice to Dr. LIND. It moderates so effectually the force of the paroxysm by shortening the dura∣tion of the cold fit, as well as by diminishing the violence of the hot fit, that I had often flattered myself it was capable of curing intermittents. In this however I was disappointed.</P>
<P>From the experience of it in many hundred cases, I conclude with Dr. LIND. <Q>"That an Opiate given soon after the commencement of the hot fit, by abating the violence and lessening the duration of the fever, preserves the constitution so entirely uninjured, that since I used Opium in agues, neither a dropsy nor jaundice has at∣tacked any of my patients in these diseases."</Q> The manner in which I employ it, is either by giving a grain of the <HI>Thebaic</HI> extract upon the ac∣cession of the cold fit, or <HI>twenty</HI> drops of the <HI>Theba∣ic</HI> tincture upon the accession of the hot fit, the ac∣tion
<PB N="25" REF="40"/>of the former being later from its flower so∣lubility.</P>
<P>The red Bark is so much warmer than the other, that it would seem to answer all the purposes de∣rived from the union of cordials, aromatics, serpen∣taria and the like so much recommended in the obstinate <HI>Quartan</HI> intermittents of elderly people.</P>
<P>Some difference in opinion has prevailed regard∣ing the manner of giving the Bark. Most practi∣tioners concur in thinking that it cures intermit∣tents more readily when taken in substance than in any other form. In this state, it is both a bulky and nauseous dose in the quantity necessary to cure an intermittent, at any rate, it ought rather to be diffused in some liquid, than given in the form of an electuary or pills, which are sometimes dif∣ficultly soluble.</P>
<P>I have found milk cover the taste of Bark and make it more acceptable to children than any o∣ther vehicle. The extract of liquorice dissolved
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>in water, may be likewise employed to cover the taste of Bark. Its taste is also corrected by wine, especially by Old Hock.</P>
<P>It would appear from the general preference given to Bark in substance, that its decoction, infu∣sion or tincture are found too weak in any quan∣tity for the purpose of curing intermittents, other∣wise as they are much lighter to the stomach and act more quickly, they should be preferred.</P>
<P>I hope to make it appear that in this respect the red Bark has evidently the advantage of any other kind now in use, since either its infusion or decoc∣tion will cure intermittents, and that its powder in a much smaller dose than that of common Bark will produce similar effects.</P>
<P>The best time for giving the Bark is in the inter∣mission between the paroxysms and when the sto∣mach is empty. In <HI>Quartan</HI> fevers, where there are <HI>two</HI> days of <HI>Apyrexia,</HI> we should be particular∣ly desirous of getting down a large quantity on the
<PB N="27" REF="42"/>day immediately preceding the approaching pa∣roxysm, and in other intermittents as near the peri∣od of the returning paroxysm as the stomach will bear it.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to limit the dose. One drachm may be given every hour, if the stomach will re∣tain it, and will remove the disease more quickly than a smaller quantity given at longer periods.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I have likewise frequently adopted the practice recommended by Dr. HOME, of giving the Bark so soon as the sweating fit of the fever has sufficiently carried off the hot fit; this is particularly proper when the interval is short between the paroxysms.</NOTE></P>
<P>The following facts will best deter∣mine how far I am justified in favouring the opinion of the superior excellence of the red Bark.</P>
<P>EDWARD VIRGOE, aged 21, had laboured un∣der an intermittent fever <HI>five</HI> months. It was first
<PB N="28" REF="43"/>a <HI>tertian</HI> and afterwards became a regular <HI>Quotidian,</HI> accompanied with cough, dyspnoea and hoarseness particularly in the paroxysm. The common Per∣uvian Bark, given in the dose of one drachm every hour prevented the return of the paroxysm for a few days; the patient however soon relapsed not with∣standing the Bark was continued, he was at last cured by taking one drachm of the red Bark eve∣ry second hour for the space of <HI>ten</HI> days.</P>
<P>It appears from the above case of <HI>Edward Vir∣goe,</HI> and several others which have occurred to me, that intermittent fevers which had resisted common Bark and other remedies, have yielded to the red Bark, even under very complicated and unfavour∣able appearances.</P>
<P>In this opinion I am likewise justified by the ex∣perience and testimony of many eminent practiti∣oners, and so decided are they in its favour that the demand for it every day increases, especially in some of the neighbouring counties where intermit∣tents are not only more frequent, but more obstinate.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="44"/>
<P>I began now to suspect that its powers were even sufficient in cold infusion in most cases to cure in∣termittent fevers, and in all other cases to answer every purpose which might be expected from com∣mon Peruvian Bark, in any form in which it had hitherto been employed.</P>
<P>The following facts are sufficient to au∣thorise this opinion.</P>
<P>JAMES YOUNGMAN, aged 16, had laboured under a <HI>tertian</HI> intermittent many months; it was accompanied with a severe cough, and his strength was considerably impaired. He was ordered to take <HI>four</HI> ounces of the cold infusion of the red Bark every <HI>third</HI> hour; after taking it for <HI>two</HI> days the paroxysm did not return. Its use was persevered in <HI>fourteen</HI> days, and he continued perfectly well.</P>
<P>THOMAS PUGH, aged 22, from <HI>Woolwich</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> had an intermittent fever of <HI>five</HI> weeks stand∣ing of the <HI>Tertian</HI> type, accompanied with a con∣siderable degree of cough, occurring especially in the cold fit, he took the cold infusion, as recom∣mended
<PB N="30" REF="45"/>in the former case, since which time he had only one flight return of the paroxysm, his cough is likewise totally removed.</P>
<P>JOHN WELDING, aged 25, had an intermittent fever at <HI>Sheerness</HI> for near a year, he took, large quantities of common Peruvian Bark without effect. It was of the <HI>Quotidian</HI> type. After taking a cold in∣fusion of the red Bark in the quantity of a quart in <HI>twenty-four</HI> hours for <HI>three</HI> days, the paroxysm disappeared and has never since returned. It pro∣ved at first purgative but soon lost that effect. His strength and appetite were greatly improved, under the use of the infusion.</P>
<P>The cold infusion employed in the above cases was prepared by pouring a quart of cold water on <HI>two</HI> ounces of the red Bark in fine powder, frequently, agitating them for the space of <HI>twenty∣four</HI> hours.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="marg">Tho' the cases above mentioned evidently prove that the cold infusion will cure Agues, yet they are not intended to divert the attention from other more ef∣fectual means of giving this Medecine.</NOTE></P>

<PB N="31" REF="46"/>
<HEAD>Of its use in the cure of other Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>Remittent fevers are frequently equally steady in their periods of remission and accession with those of the intermittent kind, but the <HI>Apyrexia</HI> be∣ing less perfect and complete has given rise to many doubts regarding the safety of giving Bark. As remittent fevers are more particularly marked by appearances indicating the prevalence of bile in the stomach; the propriety of giving an <HI>Emetic,</HI> prior to the use of the Bark, seems well ascertained, and the remission is frequently rendered more complete by such a practice.</P>
<P>In the remitting fevers, however, of warm cli∣mates, the accession of the paroxysm is so extremely violent, and the strength of the patient so quickly exhausted, that it becomes absolutely necessary to catch the first opportunity of the most trifling re∣mission, and to give the Bark with the same free∣dom that you would do in common intermittents.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="47"/>
<P>In remitting fevers, the concomitant symptoms are more to be regarded than in intermittents, be∣cause they more especially disturb, interrupt, and shorten the periods of remission; even in the warmest climates, and under the severest prejudices, it has been sound necessary to take away a few ounces of blood to relieve pain in the head, oppression in breathing, an intense dry heat on the skin, and other symptoms protracting the paroxysm; by such means the remission has been brought on, and the Bark given with more effect.</P>
<P>The fevers of this country seldom have regular remissions, until they have been properly treated by evacuations; the inflammatory by bleeding, and the bilious by vomiting and purging.</P>
<P>When fevers are brought into a state of obvious remission, that is, when the pulse becomes from 10 to 20 slower at some particular time in the 24 hours; when the restlessness, anxiety, and tendency to delirium abate; when the mouth and fauces are moist; when the organs of secretion, and especially
<PB N="33" REF="48"/>the skin are more open and pervious, such symptoms of remission admit the use of Bark with the same freedom as in intermitting fevers.</P>
<P>The acute rheumatism, notwithstanding its inflam∣matory attack, and the appearance of the blood, and although the joints often continue inflamed se∣veral weeks, very early assumes the form of a re∣mitting fever.</P>
<P>Under such circumstances, a perseverance in the <HI>Antiphlogistic</HI> plan is generally found to be ineffec∣tual. I have, in several cases of this kind, employed a cold infusion of the red Bark, and the disease seemed to give way only to this treatment.</P>
<P>The acute rheumatism in its remissions assumes the form of a double <HI>Tertian,</HI> and the patient is fre∣quently greatly exhausted by the profuse sweatings which terminate the paroxysm.</P>
<P>It is in such cases that I would particularly re∣commend the use of Bark. I have found this prac∣tice
<PB N="34" REF="49"/>more successful, and it must be allowed to be more rational than the use of <HI>Volatiles</HI> and <HI>Guaiac.</HI></P>
<P>It does not appear to me in any degree repug∣nant to just theory founded on observations made in similar cases, that at a time when the lancet may be used moderately or topical bleeding with more freedom, the Bark may be given so as to obviate the debility of a long and tedious disease, and by keeping up the strength of the system, prevent that torpor and disposition to chronic rheumatism so frequently the effect of the acute.</P>
<P>In that low fever, which HUXHAM has so well described under the title of nervous, I have pre∣scribed the cold infusion of the red Bark with ad∣vantage, where the skin hath been soft, and the pulse under one hundred and ten.</P>
<P>In such fevers, it chiefly acts as a cordial in supporting the <HI>Vis Vitae,</HI> and for which reason I think it may be given with advantage in the de∣cline of all fevers, even where the symptoms on the attack of the disease were evidently inflammatory.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="50"/>
<P>Almost every Fever remits in its decline.</P>
<P>Fevers originally putrid and malignant, as arising from <HI>Miasmata</HI> and putrid vapour, very seldom oc∣cur in this City, they are most generally to be found in Fleets and in Camps, and in situations where air stagnates or where animal bodies are confined in a close place.</P>
<P>In such fevers, the cure is effected by vomiting and warm cordials, of the last is the red Bark in an eminent degree.</P>
<P>It may be infused in wine, which will render its operation more antiseptic.</P>
<P>It intimately unites with the several acids, from which a very favourable operation in such cases may be expected.</P>
<P>In the putrid fever, attended with a gangrenous sore throat, I have in many instances experience∣ed the efficacy of Bark, but care should be taken
<PB N="36" REF="51"/>not to confound this disease with the <HI>Angina Mucosa</HI> of Dr. HUXHAM, or the <HI>Angina Erysipelatosa</HI> of Dr. GRANT, diseases, tho' contagious and accom∣panied with <HI>Eruptions</HI> on the skin, evidently of the most inflammatory nature and requiring the use of <HI>Evacuations.</HI></P>
<P>In Petechial Fevers with symptoms of great pro∣stration of strength, I have frequently seen the pulse not much quickened and the animal heat very little increased. In such cases I would recom∣mend the use of the red Bark infused in Old Hock.</P>
<P>I have seen a Jail Fever with no other distin∣guishing symptoms than Petechiae and Debility; the Tongue clean, the pulse moderate tho' small, and the secretions apparently not disturbed. In that case, blisters on the Extremities, Bark and Wine are the best remedies.</P>
<P>In general we find that Fevers marked with symptoms of debility are chiefly found to remit,
<PB N="37" REF="52"/>and therefore they admit of the use of Bark; by in∣creasing the Tone and Vigor of the system, it op∣poses a returning Paroxysm.</P>
<P>Fevers of more violent action, such as we de∣nominate inflammatory, do not remit at least so obviously, until that action is moderated by Eva∣cuations, so that they chiefly remit only in their decline.</P>
<P>The primary attack of most severs in this coun∣try, is attended with violent action, which is best moderated sometimes by the prudent use of the lancet, but most frequently by the <HI>Tart. Emetis</HI> with the infusion of <HI>Sena</HI> and some of the neutral salts. All severs beginning with a violent <HI>Rigor,</HI> and fol∣lowed with great heat, require early evacuations, while such as creep on slowly and imperceptibly in the beginning, with giddiness in the head, rather than acute pain, much anxiety and watchfulness, tremor and debility, give way to Opiates, Bark, Serpentaria and Wine. Blisters applied to the arms are ex∣tremely useful in keeping up the pulse, especially if
<PB N="38" REF="53"/>the skin be soft, the tongue and fauces sufficiently moist; much more may be learned by attending to this last appearance than is generally known.</P>
<P>It is necessary, however, to distinguish between the dryness of the tongue and mouth, as a symp∣tom of the fever, and as arising from the circum∣stance of a patient sleeping with his mouth open.</P>
<P>I hope the observations here offered to the pub∣lic on the subject of this invaluable remedy, will re∣move all prejudices against a Peruvian Bark of a large and coarser appearance, than is generally employed.</P>
<P>It is at present in very great demand, the difficulty of procuring it will not, I hope, instigate Druggists and Dealers in the article, to substitute at any time a spurious kind in its room.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Mr. EDWARD JACOB, jun<SUP>r.</SUP> an eminent Surgeon, at <HI>Feversham,</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE had such repeated opportunities of trying the Red Bark, that I hope to be able to give you every satisfaction, you can wish, of its superior efficacy over the Bark in common use.</P>
<P>Our situation being in a country not far distant from the marshes, renders the inhabitants more ex∣posed to intermittent complaints than those of cities and more inland counties; and, I assure you, before the use of the Red Bark was known, the Ague, from its particular stubborness, (as we then thought, or what we have since observed from the want of efficacy in the other Bark,) might be truly called the <HI>opprobrium Medicorum;</HI> but, now I think, that stain is entirely removed, for I have not met with one single case, where (when I could persuade the patient to adhere steadily to my advice) I have ever found the Red Bark to fail.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="55"/>
<P>The Peruvian Bark, with which I was formerly provided, was of the best kind, and always had in the quill; yet, it was even much inferior in its ef∣fects to what ought reasonably to be expected from it.</P>
<P>The first knowledge that ever we had of the Red Bark was in <HI>March,</HI> 1781, when a few pounds was sent us to try its effects; our Druggist informed us that it was then in use at St. <HI>Bartholomew's Hospital,</HI> and was there found effectual. It remained in our house till <HI>May</HI> following, when I was attacked with an Ague; I did not at first think of trying the <HI>new</HI> Bark, for I guessed, by taking of the <HI>old</HI> in great quantity, which would not be disagreeable to me, that my Ague would soon leave me; but, to my great disappointment, fit succeeded fit, without shewing the least good effect of the remedy applied. I was then determined to try the <HI>new</HI> Bark; but, finding my Ague stubborn I emptied the <HI>Primae Viae</HI> by an Emetic and Carthartic, and immediately, on the fe∣ver going off, I took one drachm of the Red Bark in fine powder, mixed with three ounces of the de∣coction, and a small quantity of the tincture, which
<PB N="41" REF="56"/>being a draught well loaded with Bark, at first seem∣ed to sit uneasy on the stomach; (which I have se∣veral times on being first taken, found the case with some of my patients, but which never took from its effect,) but, after resting for some time, I found myself in a state to continue its use. My Ague from that time kept off; till, from omitting the Bark two soon, (and finding myself quite well) in a few weeks after, slight symptoms appeared again; but, which never formed a direct fit, the Bark being again repeated, eradicated the disorder.</P>
<P>My father, now in the 70th year of his age, has since that time been attacked with an Ague; but, from his having been before seized with a chilliness without subsequent sever, suffered himself to have three fits without trying any remedy: being then convinced of the reality of the Ague, applied to this Bark in decoction, with some tincture made of the same; he found it so effectual, that after taking it, the fit did not once return; he omitted the Bark too soon, and had one slight fit; but, after repeating
<PB N="42" REF="57"/>the same remedy a few days, it has not since return∣ed, and he is now perfectly well.</P>
<P>The patients, who have received immediate re∣lief from the <HI>new</HI> Bark, are so numerous, that I cannot with any degree of certainty guess the number.</P>
<P>The quantity that we have used, from <HI>July,</HI> 1781, to the present time, is upwards of sixty pounds. The manner in which we have used it, with a view to prevent the return of an approaching paroxysm, is by giving ½ a drachm or 1 drachm of the Powder, mixed with two ounces of the decoction, and a small quantity of the tincture. The decoction we have used, has been prepared by boiling three ounces of the gross powder boiled in two quarts of water to one quart. When the patient has been of a more delicate frame, or when it has been used as a corro∣borant, we have given the decoction and tincture without the powder. When the Ague has been but recently contracted, we have seldom trusted to any thing but the Bark, but when stubborn, evacuants
<PB N="43" REF="58"/>have been first given; half an ounce of the pow∣der has very frequently cured an Ague without evacuants, or more Bark, when the fit was a re∣cent one; we have now entirely left off giving the <HI>old</HI> Bark in any form since we have found so good effects from the Red Bark, and we used the Resin of Red Bark with good success, in ma∣ny cases, where the Patient could take it only in the form of Pills. I heartly hope the above account will prove satisfactory to you, if not I shall think myself very happy in answering at any time any future enquiries.</P>

<P>I AM sorry it is not in my power to send you particular Cases of the effects of the Red Bark. Having made no memorandums, I can only say, in general, that it is a much better Kind of Bark, than any I have been able to procure hitherto. Whether the Intermittents have been worse than common, or the Grey Bark has been of inferior Quality, I will not take upon me to determine; but we were all unusually foiled in our attempts to cure that Complaint, till we were furnished with the <HI>New</HI> Bark. I can have no Inducement to give a higher Character of this Drug, than it de∣serves: but, I do assure you, that, since I began to use it, it has not once failed me, when the Patient has taken it in a proper manner. Hence, I have a firm persuasion of its superior efficacy, and I am the more confirmed in my Opinion, by knowing that my Sentiments correspond with yours,
<PB N="45" REF="60"/>and with those of all my medical acquaintance, in this Neighbourhood, who have made trial of it.

<P>IN which he shews, by a variety of cases, that in the cure of intermittents, in that part of the world, the Red Bark had not only been infi∣nitely more effectual than the common Peruvian Bark, or any other remedy usually employed, but that it had radically cured where cold bathing, eme∣tics, opiates, bitters and friction failed, and where the best Pale Bark, both by itself, and with a variety of other medicines, was exhibited without effect, even to the quantity of sixteen ounces. The form he gives it in, is that of an electuary, with the addition of a small quantity of the essential oil of pepper-mint and caraway-seed; and he seldom has occasion, he says, to use more than from 4 to 6 ounces. One case he mentions, where a sphacelus had taken place
<PB N="47" REF="62"/>in a malignant fever, accompanied with delirium and every other bad symptom, the patient was re∣covered by the use of the Red Bark, Anodynes, and Wine; the sphacelus separating kindly, the fe∣ver and bad symptoms speedily gave way.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I am likewise favoured with another let∣ter from Sir WILLIAM BISHOP, dated <HI>June</HI> 23d, which contains many sen∣sible and judicious hints upon this subject.</HEAD>
<P>HE recommends the grinding Red Bark into the finest powder by a mill, and afterwards sifting it through the finest cypress sieve, in order that it may sit lightly on the stomach, and that its parts may be uniformly blended together: he observes, that if, after breaking the Bark, you examine the broken pieces, by means of a glass in the sun shine, you will see the resin like spangles of gold between the internal woody fibres and the outward grey coat; by comparing this appearance with the best Pale
<PB N="48" REF="63"/>Bark, you will discover that the Red Bark contains a much larger quantity of resinous parts.</P>
<P>Two scruples of Bark, as coarsly powdered as is commonly fold by the apothecaries, will be as disa∣greable to take, as a drachm or four scruples finely ground. One drachm is the dose he generally gave to an adult, although he sometimes met with pa∣tients, who would choose to take two or three drachms at a dose, and those doses, at longer inter∣vals; and from experience he found that, when this last practice agreed with the stomach, it was the most effectual way of curing the intermittent. One patient took three oun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in twelve hours, and had no return of an obstinate Quartan.</P>
<P>Many Intermittents, which could not be cured by small doses, were removed by larger doses, more frequently employed.</P>
<P>He mentions that a period of <HI>five</HI> or <HI>six</HI> hours, before the expected return of a <HI>Quotidian,</HI> or <HI>Ter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian</HI> Intermittent, is all that is necessary for the
<PB N="49" REF="64"/>taking a sufficient quantity of the Red Bark, in or∣der to obviate the approaching Paroxysm. Some have been cured by taking <HI>two</HI> ounces, as quick as possible after the fit, but such as persevered in the use of it, until <HI>four</HI> or <HI>six</HI> ounces were taken acted most prudently, their health was soonest and most perfectly restored. He likewise observes, that such Persons ought to take the greatest quan∣tity of Bark, whose blood is in the most dissolved state, and where the fibres have been relaxed by the most profuse sweating, which frequently takes place in obstinate <HI>Quartans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quotidians</HI> require but a small quantity, <HI>Tertians</HI> will yield to fewer doses than our <HI>Kentish Quartans.</HI></P>
<P>He found it better to get down <HI>five</HI> or <HI>six</HI> ounces of Bark, in eight or ten days, than to allow a larger time for the same quantity. Labouring people, who work out of doors in cold foggy mornings, either in marshy grounds or wet lands, from sun rife till the dew of the evening, and who sweat profusely, and suffer their wet linen to dry on their backs, will not
<PB N="50" REF="65"/>be safe from a return of the quartan fever, with less than five ounces taken after the last fit, as the good effects of all they had taken before, are very pro∣bably carried off and dissipated in the ensuing paroxysm.</P>
<P>He likewise observes that the Bark in large doses will not cure the irregular fits of an ague and fe∣ver, which so often afflicts persons, when matter is forming in the lungs, in the <HI>Phthisis Pulmonalis.</HI></P>
<P>The letter from Sir William Bishop, which con∣vey these observations; likewise contain much va∣luable information on other medical subjects, and I hope the ingenious author will, on some future oc∣casion, favour the public with them.</P>

<HEAD>A letter from Dr. WITHERING, an emi∣nent Physician, at <HI>Birmingham, June</HI> 29, 1782.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much pleased, that you have undertaken to give us an account of the Red Peruvian Bark. A Publication upon that subject, cannot fail to pro∣duce good effects, by removing the prejudices of some, the ignorance of others, and ultimately by exciting our merchants to obtain liberal supplies of a medicine so truly valuable. The universal pre∣valence of intermittent fevers this spring gave us a large experience of its effects. We have not many intermittents in the town of Birmingham; but, in other parts of the county of Warwick, in Stafford∣shire, Shropshire, Worcestershire and Oxfordshire, so far as my rides extend, they have been more ge∣neral than ever known before in the memory of the oldest practitioners I have conversed with.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
<P>After taking pains to recommend the Red Bark to all the Apothecaries I met with, and consequent∣ly not less anxious to learn their observations re∣lative to its effects, I can say that they unanimous∣ly concur in asserting <Q>"that they have never been disappointed in their expectations when they ex∣hibited it to Patients labouring under Intermit∣tents."</Q></P>
<P>Now the Intermittents which I have seen, have pretty generally assumed the Tertian Type in light soils, and the Quartan Type in clayey countries. Of the latter, I have had the care of some which were from 6 to 18 Months duration, originating in <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Essex.</HI> I have known two instances only of Quartans in which the Red Bark did not pre∣vent a recurrence of the Fits; I saw one of these pa∣tients afterwards; he laboured under Hepatic and anasarcous symptoms, these were removed in a fortnight by the usual methods, and then the Bark effected a cure. The other case was at a consider∣able distance from this place, and I have not yet learnt its termination.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="68"/>
<P>It will require some farther experience to ascer∣tain the <HI>necessary</HI> doses. I know some practiti∣oners who have given one or two drachms every four hours betwixt the fits, but I have never had oc∣casion to give more than thirty or forty grains at similar intervals of time.</P>
<P>As to its preparations I can say but little; pre∣ferring always in my own practice the simple pow∣der; but, I am told, that it makes a very rich tinc∣ture, and, I have seen decoctions of it very high coloured and turbid.</P>
<P>But it may be asked—would not the common or Quill Bark, have produced similar good effects in the intermittents of the present year? From the reports of other practitioners; I believe it would not. From my own experience, I can give no other answer, to such a question, than, by saying, that after frequent and almost continual dis∣appointments, from the use of common Quill Bark, I have not tried to cure a single intermittent with it for more than seven years past; relying en∣tirely
<PB N="54" REF="69"/>upon the use of evacuants, opium and metallic salts. To render this last assertion reconcilable to the daily experience of others, it may be necessary to observe, that with us, a Physician is seldom con∣sulted in fevers of the intermittent kind, unless some unusual appearance, or some uncommon obstinacy in the recurrence of the attack, alarms the patient or his friends.</P>
<P>Whether the medicine in question, be the product of the same tree from which the Quill Bark is de∣rived, may be difficult to determine, but I am per∣suaded it is the medicine that was used by MORTON and SYDEN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>M, or its efficacy could never have been so proverbial. I know not what could first induce the writers upon the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> to pre∣fer the Quill Bark; but, I know if you were to ask an <HI>English Tanner,</HI> whether the Bark from the trunk; or, that from the twigs of the Oak is the strongest, he would laugh at your ignorance.</P>
<P>I communicated the contents of your letter, to my worthy friend and colleague Dr. ASH, together
<PB N="55" REF="70"/>with my opinion upon the subject: he authorises the to say that the result of his experience perfectly coincides with mine.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Mr. SHERWIN, an ingeni∣ous Surgeon, at <HI>Enfield.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE we have used the Red Peruvian Bark, we have had great success in curing Agues and in∣termitting Fevers. These disorders returned so frequently after the use of the best Peruvian Bark, which we could formerly procure that our credit, as
<PB N="57" REF="72"/>well as that of the medicine, began to fail very much, and numbers of our patients got into the hands of persons unacquainted with physic. They seemed willing to trust rather to <HI>nostrums</HI> and <HI>charms,</HI> than to a medicine which they have seen so repeatedly fail, and to the effects of which they very ingeniously ascribe every ache and pain which continue after Agues, or which are the consequences of Agues when imperfectly cured.</P>
<P>I could give a very ample detail of the inefficacy of the common Bark; but, as the complaint is ge∣neral, it would be unnecessary. I shall therefore, only take the liberty to present you with the more agreeable history of a few cases that have im∣mediately yielded to the Red Peruvian Bark, and that even when given in very moderate doses, after having obstinately resisted large quantities of the other.</P>
<P>RICHARD PARSLEY, a hard working young man, about 28 years of age, was seized with an Ague last autumn; which continued either as a <HI>Quotidian,
<PB N="58" REF="73"/>Tertian</HI> or <HI>Quartan,</HI> with very little intermission, till the 20th of <HI>April</HI> last, when I saw him accidentally. He gave me the following account. That he had taken every thing that had been recommended to him; and that his master, a worthy and respectable gentleman in this neighbourhood, had procured him the advice of different practitioners of physic, who had prescribed Bark for him in large quantities, but without benefit, as the disorder always returned with greater violence after it had been check'd a few Days. He added, that the last medicine, which he had been advised to take, was half an ounce of alum boiled in a pint of ale, to half a pint, which he was ordered to repeat three different times, as soon as he felt the Ague approach. He had in this way, he said, taken seven half ounces upon the approach of as many different fits of the Ague.</P>
<P>I suspected, that so large a quantity of alum, taken at one dose, must have produced some dangerous effects, and doubted whether he had swallowed the whole of it; but, I sound upon more particular en∣quiry, that he really swallowed half an ounce each
<PB N="59" REF="74"/>time; as he says, that he stirred it up from the bot∣tom and felt it gritty in his Teeth. It gave him great pain in his stomach. So large a quantity of Alum being taken at one dose, without materially injuring the system, is a fact, which I am persuaded you will think worthy of notice.</P>
<P>I took compassion upon this poor Fellow, and sent him 8 papers of the Red Peruvian Bark, con∣taining a drachm in each, which he finished in two intermediate days, the disorder being then a Quar∣tan. It is now seven weeks since he took this me∣dicine, and he has had no return of the complaint, but to use an expression of his own "hath felt ever since as if he had a new Inside."</P>
<P>ANNE PIGOT, a poor Girl 14 years old, has been afflicted with an Ague since Autumn last in the same Family with PARSLEY, and has also tried va∣rious medicines without effect. I prescribed small doses of the <HI>Vitriolum Coerul.</HI> fourteen days with∣out gaining any advantage. I gave her also 3 or 4 doses of a hot aromatic powder recommended
<PB N="60" REF="75"/>by Van SWIETEN consisting of Bay Berries and Chi∣na Pepper which I have frequently seen to cure, but she found no benefit from it. I cannot say whether this Girl had given the common Bark a fair trial. She begged to have some of the same medicine that cured her Relation, and about a month since had three papers, containing only one scruple in each, and, I assure you, she has been perfectly free from the complaint ever since.</P>
<P>Mr. BARNS, a very strong hard working Man, was seized last Autumn with a very violent inter∣mitting Fever, attended with Delirium, and ap∣parently much danger. After three or four par∣oxysms I removed the disorder by giving him one drachm of the best common Peruvian Bark every Hour, and continuing the same quantity twice a day afterwards; but, at the end of fourteen days, the Fever return'd with the same violence as be∣fore, and was again stop'd by the same quantity of Bark. From Autumn till the beginning of last <HI>April,</HI> it returned in this manner (at the end of
<PB N="61" REF="76"/>about fourteen days from the time it was stopped) five or six times and always with uncommon violence. The common Peruvian Bark newly powdered was repeatedly given.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> I prescribed six doses, of the Red Peruvian Bark, of one drachm each, which he took upon the going off of the <HI>Paroxysm,</HI> and I have the pleasure to inform you, that, he has had no return since that time; though I no longer used the precaution of continuing the daily use of the same medicine.</P>
<P>It is not worth while to mention common cases, where the Red Bark hath cured without the other having had the trial. A few have occurred, and I have not yet had any instance of a relapse.</P>
<P>I was lately called to a very severe case, like that of Mr. BARNES, where the intermission was not longer than 6 or 8 hours. I prescribed, and the patient took 6 drachms of the Red Bark, with∣out interrupting the paroxysm, which came at the
<PB N="62" REF="77"/>expected hour; and during the sickness and hor∣ripilatio the Bark seemed to be entirely rejected by vomiting; however the succeeding paroxysm a∣bated something of its fury. My patient was ex∣tremely averse to Bark in every shape; but by de∣ceiving him, during the following intermission, I got him to swallow two drachms at once, which ren∣dered him so entirely averse to the medicine, that he would take no more afterwards. However, to his great joy, and my surprise, the sever left him. He ascribes his cure to three or four draughts of camphorated julep, which were prescribed as a <HI>pla∣cebo</HI> upon his refusing to persevere in the use of the Bark. But it may with more justice be ascribed to the two drachms of Red Bark, taken at one dose; as I think the first six were in a great measure lost.</P>
<P>I consider the Red Peruvian Bark as a valuable acquisition to the <HI>Materia Medica:</HI> or, perhaps it may be only a restoration of what was used in the days of SYDENHAM, and some time after, when it was common for medical writers to say, that this, or that medicine would cure, with as much certainty as
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>Bark would an Ague. An eulogium to which the Bark in this country has not been of late years entitled.</P>
<P>Before I became acquainted with the superior efficacy of the Red Peruvian Bark, I had tried a variety of <HI>tonics,</HI> with very indifferent success in ge∣neral, but now and then with very happy effects, such as the <HI>Cuprum Ammoniacum, Vitriolum Coeru∣leum, Sal Vitrioli, Sal Martis,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WILLIAM KING, an athletic young man, ap∣plied to me last autumn, on account of a tedi∣ous irregular intermittent, complicated with acute fixed pain in the side, and a full strong pulse▪ much cough and hoarseness. Under these circumstances, I thought it imprudent to administer the Bark in any Form and had recourse to a plentiful bleeding, ap∣plying blisters to the part affected, and giving the <HI>Decoct. Taraxac.</HI> with <HI>Tart. Solubile,</HI> and honey in large quantities. The disorder was clearly an Ague; but attended with symptoms that threatened a pulmonary consumption. His blood was re∣markably
<PB N="64" REF="79"/>sizy, which induced me to make use of <HI>venesection</HI> four times, which with the above medi∣cines, and a very strict <HI>antiphlogistic</HI> regimen, re∣moved the cough and pain in the side, though the Ague still continued. I ventured at last to give him eight doses of common Bark, one drachm in each, which removed the Ague several weeks, and mended his habit much. A continuance of the Bark, twice a day, for sometime after the Ague stopped, brought on a frequent bleeding at the nose.</P>
<P>The Ague returned twice during the winter; but gave way soon to the same Bark, and he kept tolerably well till the setting-in of cold north-east winds in spring, when his Ague again returned, and brought with it the pain in the side, a bloated icteric countenance, much hoarseness and cough. After one more bleeding and the use of the <HI>Apozem</HI> for a month, I gave him six drachms of the Red Peru∣vian Bark in <HI>April</HI> last, and have had the pleasure to see him continue free from the Ague since that time, though be never repeated the dose after it stopped.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="80"/>
<P>I was unwilling to persist in the use of the Bark after the Ague stopped lest it should encrease the circulation too much and again excite a bleeding at the nose.</P>
<P>I have now indeed almost entirely laid aside the custom of persevering in the use of the Bark after the intermittent is stopped. I have for sometime suspected that it answers no good purpose, and that it may possibly now and then be the reason why large quantities of good Bark have been given in vain. It is a well known Fact, that every species of intermittent complaint frequently returns in four∣teen days after being interrupted by means of Bark, notwithstanding that medicine is continued every day. May not the daily use of Bark so habituate the constitution to its effect as to render it useless when the Intermittent returns?</P>
<P>I am now satisfied when I have put a stop to the expected paroxysm, and prescribe an anodyne to be in readiness if ever the cold fit returns, advising my patient to have recourse to the same quantity of
<PB N="66" REF="81"/>Bark which he found necessary at first, and to take it as soon as the succeeding sever abates. I adopt∣ed this practice a little time before I became ac∣quainted with the superior efficacy of the Red Bark, and thought it an improvement, but since that time I have succeeded so well by giving six or eight drachms between the paroxysms that I have seldom had occasion to repeat a single dose.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>A Letter from Dr. FOTHERGILL, an eminent Physician, in <HI>Harpur Street.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN answer to your obliging request, I shall now proceed to lay before you, the best informa∣tion I can concerning the New Bark, lately intro∣duced into practice, under the name of CORTEX RUBER OR RED BARK. As it was found on board a Spanish prize intermixed with a small quantity of common Peruvian Bark, it would seem to be no other than the produce of the trunk or large branches of the same tree. It seems to be possessed of the same sensible qualities only in a much higher degree, hence it yields a much larger proportion of resi∣nous extract, and gives a more saturated tincture, and decoction than the common Bark. Hence too I have found (according to what you lately ob∣served) that the decoction may be exposed a long time to the open air, without contracting the de∣gree of acidity, which manifestly takes place in that of the common Bark in a few days.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="83"/>
<P>It has been remarked for many years past, that the Peruvian Bark has often disappointed the ex∣pectation of the public; having fallen greatly short of that high degree of efficacy, for which writers of the last century, have so highly extolled it. Few Physicians of extensive practice, but must sometimes have had the mortification to observe their favou∣rite specific entirely baffled by a regular intermit∣tent, without being able to assign any probable cause of the defeat, except the <HI>ungenuineness</HI> of the medi∣cine; Whence it would seem to follow, either that the intermittents of late years, have been more <HI>obsti∣nate</HI> in their nature, or that the Bark has been of an <HI>inferior quality</HI> to that which was used by Dr. SYDEN∣HAM, and many of his respectable contemporaries, of whose veracity we can entertain no reasonable doubt. The latter appears to me to be the more probable, especially when it is considered that of late years, it has been customary (for what reason I cannot imagine) to select the Bark of the small branches, under the denomination of <HI>Quilled</HI> Bark, in preference to that of the trunks. Should this preference hereafter be discovered to have been
<PB N="69" REF="84"/>groundless, (agreeable to what I have long suspected) it may perhaps contribute to explain the principle cause of our disappointments. In the art of tan∣ning, experience has long determined in favour of large Oak Bark, as being greatly preferable to that of the smaller twigs. Why the reverse of this should take place in a medicinal view, is by no means evi∣dent, especially if the virtue of the Peruvian Bark keeps pace in any degree with its astringency.</P>
<P><HI>Spanish</HI> practitioners, as I have been lately in∣formed, are so well convinced of this, that they al∣ways prefer the large Peruvian Bark; separating it from the smaller sort, for all important purposes, of which the late capture indeed seems to afford a proof.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This must not however be confounded with those coarse woody flakes, which constitute a large proportion of the worst kind of Bark, now in use. For these, hav∣ing been already stripped of the outer rind, consist of a mere ligneous substance divested of resin, and consequent∣ly of medioinal virtue.</NOTE> Future observations may probably discover that this was the real genuine Bark, with which our ancestors cured all the various kinds of Intermit∣tents,
<PB N="70" REF="85"/>with a degree of certainty, which now asto∣nishes their successors.</P>
<P>If Bark taken from the large branches should be sound to be more efficacions than that of the small, is it not reasonable to believe, that, that of the trunk, or rather of the root, might surpass both in virtue? Political reasons, however, respecting the preserva∣tion of the trees, which produce so important an article of commerce, will, it is to be apprehended effectually deter the inhabitants from every experi∣ment of this nature.</P>
<P>A very eminent Druggist, who purchased a large share of the above cargo, assures me, that many of the Apothecaries whom he has supplied with the Red Bark, and who have carefully compared its ef∣fects with those of the common <HI>cortex,</HI> make no scruple of deciding in its favour. He further adds that the demand for it has increased so rapidly of late, that the stock in hand is already nearly ex∣hausted.</P>
<PB N="71" REF="86"/>
<P>It is to be regretted that the passion for interlard∣ing this simple febrifuge with other bitters and as∣tringents (after the usual mode of practice) but still too much prevails! Under this false idea of ad∣ding to its efficacy, its virtue may often be greatly diminished, and at all events, the result of the trial must be rendered extremely equivocal. In justice to the remedy, and to obviate this uncertainty concerning its effects, I have embraced every op∣portunity (which so short a space would admit,) of administring it in its simple state, without intermix∣ing it with other medicines. The cases in which I have chiefly tried it, have been low putrid Fevers, attended with extreme prostration of strength, deli∣rium during the evening exacerbations, with short, and obscure remissions in the day time. In one in∣stance of this kind, <HI>Petechiae</HI> appeared, and were suc∣ceeded by a <HI>nasal haemorrhage,</HI> which generally re∣turned with the exacerbations, till the patients strength seemed to be nearly exhausted, accompa∣nied with cold sweats, and involuntary twitchings, &amp;c. His narrow escape from this most critical situa∣tion,
<PB N="72" REF="87"/>I attribute to a liberal use of this Bark, and aci∣dulated liquors drank copiously. From its success in this, and several other instances, which have fal∣len under my own observation, I am strongly in∣clined to believe that it will soon become an object worthy of attention, but must decline, giving a decisive opinion concerning its superiority, till I know the result of a variety of cases, in which it is now under trial, and also receive additi∣onal confirmation from such correspondents, as are less prepossessed in its favour than myself, be∣cause they may be supposed to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove in reality more impartial judges. Therefore in the interim, I shall wait with impatience for your intended publication, hoping that by thus collecting the sentiments, and observations of several practitioners in different parts of the kingdom, we may at length be enabled to ascertain the true comparative merit of the <HI>Red Bark,</HI> which cannot but afford great satisfaction to the public at large, as well as to,</P>

It may not be improper to add, that I have generally administred it in sub∣stance, from two scruples to a drachm, every two hours, except during the paroxysm or midnight exacerbation, when it has been cautiously avoided. Because I have long been convinced by experi∣ence, and attentive observation, that the febrile symptoms are commonly exasperated whenever
<PB N="74" REF="89"/>common Bark is taken at that period. If the Red Peruvian Bark should be found to answer com∣pletely, and that in smaller doses, it will be ex∣tremely interesting to the Patients, and no less plea∣sing to the Physician especially when he can with confidence pronounce,</P>
