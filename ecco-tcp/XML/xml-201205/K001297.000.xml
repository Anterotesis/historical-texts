<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS small Treatise was origi∣nally intended for a private Paper of Instructions to the <HI>GENTLEMAN,</HI> whose Name it bears, to direct him how to manage himself under the <HI>Gout.</HI> It is, in∣deed, an Abstract of a larger one, on the same Subject, which has lain by me these seven Years; which, yet, I have not had Leisure or Humour to finish. Several Co∣pies of this having got Abroad, and the pi∣tiful Condescendence of Pyrating Booksellers, even to such Trifles as these, have constrain'd me to let it come out in Print, as it is, to prevent its coming out from them. The
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>Gentlemen of the Profession may easily per∣ceive, by the Grossness of the Philosophy, and the low Detail of the Pharmacy, it was not design'd for them. If any shall think fit to dispute or criticise on the <HI>Doctrine</HI> here laid down, they may do it securely, as if the Author were as much dead, as these his Labours will shortly be: I hope I know the Value of Time and Pains, and the Va∣nity of all Human Speculations better, than to employ them in defending such Trifles. All I undertake for them, is, That the Facts may be depended upon for their Truth. And the Method and Medicines for their Effica∣cy, towards the End, in the Circumstances propos'd. If any Person under them, shall either amuse himself, by reading this Pa∣per; or lighten his Gain by following its Di∣rections, I shall have obtain'd all I propos'd by it.</P>
<P>As to the Account of the <HI>Bath Wa∣ters</HI> given here, it came naturally in the way of my Subject; and is such as the Observations I have made suggested to me. I scarce know, and have taken no Notice of what others may have written or observ'd on these Waters; nor, indeed, had it been possible for me, in my present
<PB N="iii" REF="4" MS="y"/>Situation, being without my Books, and con∣fin'd to Bounds, by the Nature of my Design. I have often observ'd, with Ad∣miration, the Wisdom and Goodness of Pro∣vidence, in furnishing so wonderful an An∣tidote, to almost all the <HI>Chronical</HI> Distem∣pers of an <HI>English</HI> Constitution and Climate, which are chiefly owing to Errors of Diet, or rather, as a sacred Writer expresses it, To <HI>Idleness and Fulness of Bread.</HI> The Rank∣ness of the Soil; the Richness of the Provisions; the living so much on Flesh Meats; the Incon∣stancy of the Weather, and the indulging in sedentary Amusements, or speculative Stu∣dies, directly leading thereto. To remedy all which, <HI>kind Heaven</HI> has provided <HI>Bath Waters</HI> as the most <HI>Sovereign Restorative</HI> in all the Weaknesses of the <HI>Concoctive Powers.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THE Introduction. <HI>Page 1. §. 1.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the reason why, of two Persons in all other Circumstances the same, the one has the <HI>Gout,</HI> the other is free from it, is, That the <HI>small Vessels</HI> of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person in their <HI>original Confor∣mation</HI> are narrower and more stiff than those of the other. <HI>p. 2. §. 2.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>Cause</HI> of an acquired <HI>Gout</HI> in the first Person, or those born of sound Pa∣rents; is the abundance of <HI>Tartarous, Urinous,</HI> or other Salts introduc'd into the Blood by the Food. <HI>p. 2. §. 3.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we learn the reason why, on the first Attacks of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in otherwise healthy People, the Humours generally fall on the Joynts of the Limbs. <HI>p. 4. §. 4.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may likewise see the reason, why the first <HI>Fits</HI> enrage and remit once in twenty four Hours: why the whole <HI>Fit</HI> lasts fourteen Days; and lastly, why the <HI>Accesses</HI> and <HI>Remissions</HI> of those broken
<PB REF="6"/>with the <HI>Gout,</HI> happen only in fourteen Days: And why the whole <HI>Duration</HI> in such is made up of several such <HI>Accesses</HI> and <HI>Remissions. p. 4. §. 5.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may discover the reason why <HI>Gou∣ty</HI> Persons are People of good natural Parts, large Feeders, and long-liv'd. <HI>p. 6. §. 6.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may conclude, that a <HI>Fit</HI> of the <HI>Gout</HI> is an Effort of Nature to throw off this abundance of Salts, through the more stiff and narrow <HI>Strainers;</HI> or we may consider it as a <HI>Crisis</HI> of a putrid Fever, where the noxious Humour is discharg'd on some of the Muscles or Joynts. <HI>Ibid. §. 7.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may discover the Vanity of all Pretenders to an <HI>universal</HI> and certain Remedy for the <HI>Gout. p. 7. §. 8.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence there can be but two direct ways of treating the <HI>Gout;</HI> one by widening the Capacities of the <HI>small Vessels;</HI> the other by lessening the Quantity of the Salts. <HI>p. 8. §. 9.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Difference between <HI>Hereditary</HI> and <HI>Acquired Gouts. p. 8. §. 10.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>From hence is concluded the Necessity of a much more strict Management in an <HI>He∣reditary</HI>
<PB REF="7" MS="y"/>than in an <HI>Acquir'd Gout. p. 9. §. 11.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Advantages of Labour and Exercise in the <HI>Gout;</HI> to which however, two Con∣ditions must be added: <HI>1.</HI> That it be n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t too violent: <HI>2.</HI> That a moderate Diet be joyn'd to it. <HI>Ibid. §. 12.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Two ways of lessening the Quantity of <HI>Salts</HI> in the Blood. The first by a vegetable Diet, and the Inconveniences thereof. <HI>Cor∣naro</HI>'s Diet recommended. <HI>p. 11. §. 13.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The other way is by <HI>Evacuations</HI> in the In∣tervals, and by a gentle slow Perspira∣tion in the Fits. <HI>p. 13. §. 14.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Secondary</HI> Methods of relieving the <HI>Gout</HI> are two: <HI>1. Dilution</HI> by proper Liquids, such as <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>German Spaa</HI> Water, or other <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Waters; <HI>Dwarf Al∣der Tea, Trifoil Tea,</HI> light, quick <HI>Green Tea,</HI> small <HI>spicy Bitters</HI> on Wa∣ter, and the like. <HI>p. 14. §. 15.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>2.</HI> Strengthners of the Instruments of <HI>Di∣gestion:</HI> the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark especially; where its Virtues and Qualities are ex∣plain'd. <HI>p. 15. §. 16.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Advantages of <HI>Mercurial</HI> Medicines in the <HI>Gout</HI> consider'd. A <HI>Salivation</HI> will banish the <HI>Gout</HI> for some time; but then
<PB REF="8"/>it tears and rends the small <HI>Fibres,</HI> whereby the future <HI>Fits</HI> become more painful and obstinate. <HI>p. 17. §. 17.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Method by which one is to treat him∣self under the Fit, in its beginning, mid∣dle and end. <HI>p. 19. §. 18.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Opiats</HI> not to be given in the <HI>Gout,</HI> but in the last Extremity; with two ways of or∣dering Forms of such Medicines. <HI>p. 21. §. 19.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The manner of treating the <HI>Gouty</HI> after the Pain is over: <HI>Stomach</HI> Purgers first, then <HI>Asses</HI> Milk is recommended; and lastly, <HI>Spaa</HI> or <HI>Bath</HI> Waters with <HI>Aro∣matick</HI> Bitters. <HI>p. 22. §. 20.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Rhubarb</HI> recommended as an excellent Pre∣servative from the <HI>Gout,</HI> taken in the In∣tervals of the <HI>Fits;</HI> with the Reasons there∣of. <HI>p. 23. §. 21.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The manner of using <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> with other <HI>succedaneous</HI> Purgatives, in case of its disagreeing. <HI>p. 25. §. 22.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sulphur,</HI> and its <HI>Flowers,</HI> recommended as the most noble of all Medicines, for the Cure of the <HI>Gout,</HI> with the Reasons there∣of; its Nature and Qualities, and the man∣ner of using it. <HI>p. 26. §. 23.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Several <HI>Dilutors</HI> recommended, especially a
<PB REF="9" MS="y"/>weak Decoction of the <HI>Bark</HI> of the <HI>Root</HI> of <HI>Sarsa;</HI> with Observations on <HI>Roselli</HI>'s Drops; and the famous <HI>Pox Doctor</HI>'s <HI>Me∣dicines. p. 31. §. 24.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Drinking freely of light, clear <HI>Spring Wa∣ter</HI> of great use after Intemperance in <HI>Gou∣ty</HI> Persons. <HI>p. 34. §. 25.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Bath</HI> Waters the best of all <HI>Dilutors</HI> in the <HI>Gout.</HI> The Nature, Cause, and Ori∣ginal Principles of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, to wit, Steel and Sulphur. <HI>Aethiops Mineral</HI> recommended: The Diseases where 'tis proper; and the manner of using it. <HI>p. 35. §. 26.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That there is a greater Proportion of <HI>Steel</HI> in <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, than is discoverable by the Senses or common Experiments: A Com∣parison between these and the other <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> hot Waters; with the manner how <HI>Bath</HI> Waters are generated. <HI>p. 40. §. 27.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Reasons why the <HI>Bath</HI> are such an ex∣cellent Remedy in the <HI>Gout,</HI> and other <HI>Chronical</HI> Distempers. <HI>p. 43. §. 28.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Bathing</HI> in the <HI>hot Baths</HI> in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout</HI> recommended. <HI>p. 45. §. 29.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Nature of <HI>Contraction</HI> and <HI>Relaxati∣on</HI> of Animal <HI>Fibres;</HI> and how <HI>Bath</HI> Wa∣ters come to cure both. <HI>p. 46. §. 30.</HI></ITEM>

<HEAD>SOME SHORT OBSERVATIONS Concerning the due METHOD Of Treating the GOUT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="I" UNIT="§."/> <SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>Esigning this Paper for the Instruction and Re∣lief of my particular Friend, I shall only make such Observations, as directly tend to that Purpose; Passing by all <HI>Theories</HI> of the Distemper, as far as is consistent with giving the Reason of my
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>Opinions. For after having laid down two <HI>Propositions</HI> (which will be found the Principles of my Reasoning through this Discourse) I proceed to the Observations themselves.</P>
<P N="1"><MILESTONE N="II" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Prop.</HI> 1. Of two Men having all o∣ther Circumstances alike, as near as may be; Of the same Parents; Born Healthy; Of the same Stature, Complexion, Diet, Air, Exercise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It seems to me impos∣sible to assign a solid Reason, why the One shou'd be afflicted with the <HI>Gout,</HI> the O∣ther be absolutely free from it, but this, That the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capillaries.</NOTE> smallest Vessels of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person must be in their natural<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Make.</NOTE> Confor∣mation narrower and more<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tense.</NOTE> stiff, than those of the Other, who is free from the <HI>Gout,</HI> in respect of their common Stature and Size. For thereby the Crude and Gross Humours, which are confin'd, or pass with Pain, in the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person, will easi∣ly flee off by Perspiration and the other Drains of the Body, in the Person free from the <HI>Gout.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><MILESTONE N="III" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Prop.</HI> 2. The Cause of an acquir'd <HI>Gout</HI> in the first Person, or in those born of sound Parents, seems to me, to be the
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>Abundance of Tartarous, Urinous, or o∣ther Salts, introduc'd into the Blood by the Food. Salts seem neither to perish, nor to be begotten; but to be constant and incorruptible Parts of Animal and Vege∣table Bodies. The Delicacy and Flavour of Flesh and Fish, is entirely owing to their abounding with a fine, soft, oyly, or urinous Salt, as is evident in Venison and Wild Fowl. Wines, of all kinds, have a grea∣ter or lesser Quantity of Tartar in them: And other strong Liquors abound in their peculiar Salts, in Proportion to their Strength. Spirits are nothing but a great Quantity of Vegetable Salts crowded to∣gether in a little Water and Oyl. These Salts receiv'd in abundance, but neither sufficiently broke by the Digestive Powers, nor driven out of the Habit by due Exer∣cise; but by their Plenty and Nearness, u∣niting in greater Clusters, must necessarily form Obstructions, and give Pain, when, by the Force of the Circulation, they are thrust through narrower and stiffer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capillaries.</NOTE> small Vessels. Nothing either receiv'd or bred within the Body, besides these Salts, can account for this Difference.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
<P N="1"><MILESTONE N="IV" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Coroll.</HI> 1. Hence we may learn the Reason why, on the first Attacks of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in otherwise healthy People, the Humours generally fall on the Joints of the Limbs: Because, in the Joints, the smallest Vessels are more compress'd, by the larger Heads or Protuberancy of the Bones, and are thereby render'd narrower and more readily obstructed. These Obstructions fall on the Joints of the Limbs; because of the greater Length of these small Vessels, be∣tween the Heart, the Origin of the Motion of all the Fluids, and these Joints; their other Extremity: Whereby the Quickness of the Circulation diminishing, Obstruc∣tions are there more readily form'd.</P>
<P N="2"><MILESTONE N="V" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Coroll.</HI> 2. Hence likewise we may see the Reason, why the first Fits, of other∣wise healthy Persons, Enrage and Remit once in Four and Twenty Hours. The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When it begins to enrage.</NOTE> Ac∣cess being at Sun-set, and the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When it begins to be easier.</NOTE> Remission about Day-break. Why the whole Fit in such lasts about fourteen Days. And last∣ly, why the particular Accesses and Re∣missions, of Persons advanc'd in Years, and broken with the <HI>Gout,</HI> happen only once in fourteen Days. And why the whole
<PB N="5" REF="17"/>Duration of the Fit is made up of several such Accesses and Remissions in equal Times. In the first Stages of the <HI>Gout,</HI> the Fluids being less Sizy and Glutinous, their Salts and Siziness are sooner broken and dissolv'd, by the Action of the Solids in the Circulation; and are thereby sooner brought into a Condition to be carry'd off by Perspiration; which makes an Access and a Remission. The greater Weight and Grossness of the Air (which hinders Perspiration) at Sun-set, beyond what it is at Day-break, together with the particu∣lar Degree of Siziness, seems to determine the Times. The greater Degree of Sizi∣ness in the Fluids, of People advanc'd in Years, and broken with the <HI>Gout,</HI> leng∣thens out the Duration of these Accesses and Remissions. And the precise Period of fourteen Days, seems to arise from the special Nature of the Siziness of the Fluids; and its Resemblance to that of a Regular intermittent Fever. The whole Duration of whose Fits put together, <HI>Sydenham</HI> has observ'd already, to be equal to fourteen Days. But the particular Explication of all these Things, wou'd require more Room than can be allow'd them, in the Bounds
<PB N="6" REF="18"/>I have prescrib'd to my self. My Friend, if he pleases, may consult <HI>Bellini</HI> on this Head.</P>
<P N="3"><MILESTONE N="VI" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Coroll.</HI> 3. Hence we may discover the Reason of the common Observation, that Gouty Persons are People of good Natural Parts, large Feeders, and long∣liv'd: Because the Fibres of the smallest Vessels, being more stiff and springy than ordinary, The Circulation is brisker, more full and free: Whereby the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is Eating, Digesting, and Evacuating, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Natural Fun∣ctions are more readily and regularly per∣form'd; and therein the best Health and truest Sensations consist: Strong Health requires liberal Supplies; and both toge∣ther lengthen our Life.</P>
<P N="4"><MILESTONE N="VII" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Coroll.</HI> 4. From these also, we may discover what a Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> is, to wit, An Effort of Nature, to throw off this A∣bundance of Salts, through more stiff and narrow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Secretory Ducts.</NOTE> Strainers. Salts of all Kinds are more or less<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Caustick.</NOTE> Burning: The Urinous most of all, as is evident from <HI>Spanish</HI> Flies, and that unextinguishable Substance, call'd the <HI>Phospheros,</HI> so readily and plen∣tifully to be had from Human Urine.
<PB N="7" REF="19"/>(The Reason of which may be from their pointed Figure, piercing more readily, by its being besmear'd with a light Oyl: Or from their greater attractive Force; or from some other Quality, not yet, or per∣haps never to be discovered.) What is certain is this, That Persons of a large Appetite, as <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons generally are, feeding plentifully of Flesh and Fish, and drinking liberally of generous Wines, or other strong Liquors, and using, either too little, or too much Exercise, must necessa∣rily overstock their Blood with these fix'd and incorruptible Parts of Animal and Vegetable Bodies; which in their Nature being Hard and Burning, can't fail, first, to raise a Tumult and Fever; and then to give violent Pain, as they are driven out of the Habit, through more stiff and nar∣row small Vessels, by the Force of the Circulation: So that a Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> may be consider'd, as a <HI>Crisis</HI> of a putrid Fever, wherein the noxious Humour is thrown upon some of the Muscles or Joints of the Body.</P>
<P N="5"><MILESTONE N="VIII" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Coroll.</HI> 5. Hence we may discover the Vanity of the Pretenders to a certain and universal Remedy for the <HI>Gout.</HI> For
<PB N="8" REF="20"/>unless a Remedy could be found, which at once cou'd change and new-mould the solid Parts of Human Bodies; alter the Nature and Qualities of Animal and Ve∣getable Bodies; and destroy Parts, that are in their own Nature fix'd and perma∣nent, it is impossible it shou'd be certain and universal; and how possible such a Remedy is, I leave every one to judge.</P>
<P N="6"><MILESTONE N="IX" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Coroll.</HI> 6. Hence it is evident, there can be only two direct Ways of Treating the <HI>Gout,</HI> with any Prospect of Success. The one is, by stretching and widening the Capacities of the small Vessels, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Slackning.</NOTE> re∣laxing their <HI>Fibres.</HI> The other is, by les∣sening the Quantity of the Salts introduc'd into the Fluids by the Food; these being the two Antidotes or Opposites to the two fundamental Causes of acquir'd <HI>Gouts.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="X" UNIT="§."/> Here it may be convenient to take notice of the Difference between heredita∣ry and acquir'd <HI>Gouts.</HI> The latter is pro∣duc'd in a Person, otherwise sound, from Ignorance or Negligence of the exact Rules of living. For tho' there be a na∣tural Configuration of Parts, that disposes one Man more than another to the <HI>Gout;</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="21"/>yet there might be a Method of Diet or∣der'd, which should prevent it. The for∣mer is a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stain.</NOTE> Taint (compounded perhaps of Scurvy, Stone and Pox) transmitted to the Patient with the Principles of Life, together with a Disposition in this Taint, to unite it self to any Malignity, introduc'd into the Habit, through Excesses.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XI" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Coroll.</HI> Hence we may observe the Necessity of a much more strict and careful Management, in hereditary <HI>Gouts,</HI> than what is necessary in acquir'd ones. In the first, the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is ingrain'd and transubstantiated into the Solids, and other Principles of Life, and impossible to be rooted out by human Art and In∣dustry: The most that can be done is, to lessen and relieve the Symptoms. Where∣as in acquir'd <HI>Gouts,</HI> the noxious Humour being more confin'd to the Fluids, a pro∣per Diet, due Exercise, and a few well-chosen Remedies, may go a great way; if not to a perfect Cure, yet to make Life tolerably easy under them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XII" UNIT="§."/> Of all those things that a <HI>Gouty</HI> Person can safely undertake for his Health, wisely manag'd Exercise, seems that alone,
<PB N="10" REF="22"/>which can best answer one part of the first Intention, <HI>viz.</HI> The widening the Ca∣pacities of the small Vessels. Labour or Exercise assists the <HI>Gouty</HI> three different ways: <HI>First,</HI> as it increases the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tine M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion.</NOTE> Motion of the Parts of the Fluids among them∣selves; so that their Salts, by their<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Collision.</NOTE> strik∣ing one against another, are broken and made less, that they may pass more rea∣dily through the small Vessels. <HI>Secondly,</HI> as it adds a new and <HI>foreign</HI> Force to the Blood, and thereby promotes its Circula∣tion from the Heart through the small Vessels; driving some of the grosser Parts of the Fluids through them; which in the ordinary Course of the Circulation wou'dn't pass so freely; and thereby opening their Obstructions and enlarging their Capaci∣ties. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> as it increases the natural Perspiration; the Action of the Muscles in Labour and Exercise, and the Spring of the Solids by their multiply'd Efforts, squeez∣ing the Strainers of all their Contents. But to make Labour and Exercise as useful as they may be, two Cautions must be added to them: <HI>First,</HI> that they be not too violent, in respect of the Patient. For
<PB N="11" REF="23"/>too violent Exercise will, necessarily, either spend the Spirits, whereby the Digestions and Circulation will be impair'd; and so a regular <HI>Gout</HI> be brought into an irregu∣lar one: Or by shaking all the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts at once upon the Extremities, a regular Fit will be forc'd out; which, in less vi∣olent Exercise, might have been spent by Perspiration. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that Moderation in eating and drinking be join'd to it; For commonly <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons are large Feeders; and Exercise emptying the Stomach, the Guts and small Vessels, if the Appetite be satis∣fy'd to its craving, the Evil is rather in∣creas'd than diminish'd thereby.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XIII" UNIT="§."/> There be two direct Ways of less∣ening the Quantity of the Salts, which produce the <HI>Gout.</HI> The first is, by a total Abstinence from, or a great Abstemious∣ness in Flesh, Fish and strong Liquors, which introduce those Salts into human Fluids: But this Course is never to be undertaken, but with great Caution, and in the last Extremity: For these two Rea∣sons; <HI>First,</HI> because an entire Vegetable Diet weakens all the digestive Powers, and all the Functions of Life; impoverishes
<PB N="12" REF="24"/>the whole Mass of the Fluids; impairs the Strength, and dispirits the Man: And thereby necessarily begets the worst kind of Hysterical and Hypocondriacal Disor∣ders, and all their black and dismal Con∣sequences (at least till the Body has been long accustom'd to it) which is a Disease far worse than the <HI>Gout</HI> it self: And to which the <HI>Gout</HI> only brings the Patient, in its last and fatal Stages. <HI>Secondly,</HI> be∣cause this Diet, once enter'd upon, is ne∣ver after to be chang'd, under the Dan∣ger of certain Death, or the most violent enraging of all the <HI>Gouty</HI> Symptoms. For a Vegetable Diet, as has been just now hinted, weakening the Digestive Powers, and all the Functions of Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Patient can never after be brought to bear with a free way of living, without the Hazard of certain Death, or a violent en∣raging of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Symptoms; as is too plain from many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> the Life of the P. of <HI>Conde.</HI></NOTE> fatal Instances. If a∣ny Diet is ever to be try'd in the <HI>Gout,</HI> it is to be order'd in <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s Method; that is, by living on the white Foods; eating Flesh and Fish of the lightest Digestion, and drinking generous, unmix'd Wines, both
<PB N="13" REF="25"/>of them in small, and constantly equal Quantities; in Weight and Measure; un∣der the Craving of the Appetite, and proportion'd for the mere Support of Life.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XIV" UNIT="§."/> The other direct way of banish∣ing the Salts out of the Habit is by Evacuati∣ons. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> otherwise a most accu∣rate Observer of Nature, and a most ju∣dicious Practitioner, has been the Occa∣sion, I think, of a great Mistake in the Management of the <HI>Gout;</HI> by forbidding almost all Evacuations, either in the Fit, or in the Intervals, for fear of weakening the Constitution. There are two Seasons, to wit, Spring and Fall, when the Peri∣odical Fits of regular <HI>Gouts</HI> commonly hap∣pen; which I consider as Cardinal and Critical Discharges, under general and me∣chanical Influences, for purifying the Blood, and discharging the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts: In which, Nature is no more to be dis∣turb'd in its Operations (I mean as to pur∣ging, for even then a gentle, slow, con∣stant and uniform Perspiration and Breath∣ing Sweat may be promoted, not only safe∣ly, but with great Advantage) than in the Monthly Purgations of the Sex. But in light, flying Touches of the <HI>Gout,</HI> out
<PB N="14" REF="26"/>of these Seasons; and in the Intervals of the Fits, gentle, warm, stomachick Purgers will be an excellent Remedy to send these a going, to lessen the Fits, and lengthen the Intervals. A Person out of the Pain and Inflammation of the Fits, and in their Intervals (except his natural Disposition to breed another Fit) is, to all Intentions of Medicines, the same as a well Person. And all Medicines levell'd against other Diseases incident to human Bodies, may be as safely administer'd to a <HI>Gouty</HI> (re∣gard being had to his particular Constitu∣tion) as to any other Person. Wherefore, the general and direct Methods of relieving the <HI>Gout,</HI> are, In the Fits, a gentle, uni∣form, continu'd Perspiration and Breath∣ing Sweat. In the Intervals, Labour or Exercise, and gentle, Stomachick Purgers.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XV" UNIT="§."/> The Secondary or less direct Me∣thods of relieving the <HI>Gout,</HI> are principal∣ly these two, <HI>First,</HI> Dilution, by proper Liquors. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Strengthners of the Instruments of the Digestion. Nothing is more likely to thin the Blood, to dissolve and break the Salts, and keep them at a distance from running into Clusters, than proper Diluters; as we see in Fevers,
<PB N="15" REF="27"/>Rheumatisms, and other inflammatory Distempers. For this Reason, among o∣thers, it is, that <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>German Spaw</HI> Waters, and all other <HI>Mineral Chalybeat</HI> Waters; Dwarf-Elder Tea; Trifoil Tea; light, quick, Green Tea; small spicy Bit∣ters on Water, and such like, drunk free∣ly, Blood warm, on an empty Stomach, become so useful in Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> Water is the universal Dissolvent of Salts of all sorts; and being replenish'd with the spicy, bitter and active Parts of other Bodies, it strengthens the Stomach, and Bowels; breaks and dissolves the Salts; cleanses the insides of the Vessels from the foulness that constantly adheres to them, and carries it out of the Body, by increas'd Perspiration and Urine.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XVI" UNIT="§."/> Strengthners of the Instruments of Digestion, are an excellent Remedy in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> If the Digestions be true and good; the Parts of the <HI>Chyle</HI> be made sufficiently small, and the Circu∣lation be full and compleat (all which are the common Effects of Stomachick Medi∣cines) the Salts will be less; the Obstruc∣tions of the small Vessels fewer, and the Impurities of the Fluids will more easily
<PB N="16" REF="28"/>pass by Perspiration, and the other Drains of the Body; and so the Fits of the <HI>Gout</HI> become more easy, and less frequent. A∣mong all the Strengthners of the Dige∣stions, I wou'd recommend a strong Infu∣sion of the <HI>Jesuit</HI>'s Bark, in generous Cla∣ret, as being the coolest Bitter, the most powerful Strengthner of relax'd <HI>Fibres</HI> in the Instruments of Digestion; and the greatest Antidote of the urinous Salts, es∣pecially if join'd with <HI>Chalybeats,</HI> and some Qualifiers of its mawkish and nauseous Taste. The Bark has the same Effect on the Coats and <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Vessels, that Oak Bark has on raw Leather; and the same Effects on the Fluids to prevent their Coagulation; and to render them uniform, that the <HI>Testaceous</HI> Powders have on Vi∣negar, or as they have on Milk, to pre∣vent its Curdling: But more especially, as it produces such Wonders on the Solids and Fluids in intermittent Fevers; to the State and Condition of both which, the So∣lids and Fluids of <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons bear so near a Resemblance, as has been observ'd in <HI>Coroll.</HI> 2. Wherever the Bark is pro∣per, I recommend the <HI>Glans Quercina,</HI> or Acorn, as of the same Class of Medicines,
<PB N="17" REF="29"/>and in some Cases of Relaxation exceeding the other. It is cool and easily digested. But they do best united. All bitter and spicy Medicines have more or less of the same Quality; but heat the Body more, and brace the <HI>Fibres</HI> less.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XVII" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Mercury,</HI> by its Weight, and its constantly forming it self in little Spheres (or perhaps from its greater attractive Force) throughout all its possible Divisions, seems to offer fairest, of any internal Me∣dicine, for breaking the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts; for relaxing the <HI>Fibres;</HI> and enlarging the Ca∣pacities of the small Vessels. And the Fact is, that by a full and free Salivation <HI>Gouty</HI> People have been freed from all its Symptoms for several Years. But it is al∣so Matter of Fact, and Experience, that a full and free Salivation does so break, rend and tear all the smallest, tenderest and fi∣nest Vessels and <HI>Fibres,</HI> that the Body be∣comes in a worse State, in respect of the future Fits, than it would have been in se∣veral Years Time, under the common Symptoms. For tho' a Salivation may o∣pen all the Obstructions of the small Ves∣sels; cleanse their insides from the Foul∣ness that cleaves to them; purify the Blood,
<PB N="18" REF="30"/>and break its saline Impurities; yet by its great Weight, and the excessive Force it adds to the Blood, rending and tearing the finest Vessels and <HI>Fibres;</HI> when the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person comes to his former Diet, and the other Circumstances of Living; and the Fluids become thereby loaded with their Salts, they stick more obstinately to the Joints, than if the Parts had been sub∣du'd and broken by regular Fits of the <HI>Gout.</HI> So that a Salivation, tho' it banish the Fits for some Time, yet when the Blood is replenish'd again with <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, the Habit is reduc'd to a worse Condition, in respect of the future Fits, than if they had never been interrupted: And, indeed, it is observable, that after a full, or repeat∣ed Salivation, the Man is seldom or ever the same, as to the Quickness of Sensa∣tion; or the Usage of the most beautiful animal Faculties. But there is an absolute Necessity of having recourse to <HI>Mercurial</HI> Vomits and Purges, when the <HI>Gout</HI> be∣comes fixt to, and permanent in a Place, as also when it is dispersed all over the Habit, like a Rheumatism. These active Medicines must first render the Humours fluid, which <HI>Gum Guajac</HI> with Diaphore∣tick
<PB N="19" REF="31"/><HI>Antimony</HI> persisted in will afterwards carry off. I come now to consider the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person under two different Circum∣stances. <HI>First,</HI> under a regular Fit. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> in the Intervals.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XVIII" UNIT="§."/> 1. On the first Attack of the Fit, especially while the Fever, that ushers it in, remains, Dilution is the only Reme∣dy. Fine, clear, old small Beer, with a little old Mountain, or <HI>Madera</HI> Wine; Water boil'd with a few Spicy Seeds, mix'd with these Wines: Water Gruel with some Wine, or Hartshorn-Drink with Cin∣namon; and little or no Flesh Meat, will succeed best during all the Time of the Fever. After the Fit is distinctly form'd, the milder Cordial and Stomachick Medi∣cines, which promote a gentle Breathing Sweat (I mean in the more compounded and tedious Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> chiefly in Persons advanc'd in Years) such as <HI>Gascoin</HI> Powder, <HI>Goa</HI> Stone, <HI>Bezoar;</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI>'s Cordial, <HI>Diascordium,</HI> Con∣fection of <HI>Alkermes,</HI> and the like, wash'd down with clear Blood-warm Sack-whey; in every Draught of which ten or fifteen Drops of Spirit of Hartshorn has been first pour'd; with Flannel on the Parts, and
<PB N="20" REF="32"/>much lying a Bed; such a Method, and such Medicines, I say, will best forward the Fit. Towards the Decline, the Stron∣ger, Warmer, Spicy and Stomachick Me∣dicines; such as <HI>Serpentary</HI> Root, <HI>Casa∣munair, Zedoary,</HI> old <HI>Venice</HI> Treacle, <HI>E∣lectuarium de Ovo,</HI> and such like; with a few Grains of <HI>Camphir,</HI> and Salt of <HI>Vipers;</HI> and a good Stomach Bitter on Wine to wash them down, will finish this Affair, streng∣then the Bowels, and prevent the Recoil of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour on them. And here it may be taken Notice of, that as the Fe∣ver, that ushers in the <HI>Gout,</HI> is, so will the Fit be: If the Fever is short and sharp, the Fit will be so likewise, in regular <HI>Gouts:</HI> If it be feeble, long and lingering, the Fit will be such also. In the Manage∣ment of the foregoing Method and Medi∣cines, two Cautions are to be minded: <HI>First,</HI> That during the whole Fit, Li∣quors may be more freely and safely in∣dulg'd, than solid Foods. For Repletion from solid Foods, in a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> might be of fatal Consequence, by ren∣dering a regular Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> irregular: Whereas Fluids will certainly pass, either by Perspiration, Sweating, or Urine. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="33"/>The Cordial Medicines are always to be regulated, by their Lightness on, and Agreeableness to the Stomach of the Patient; (for whatever makes him sick, will more or less draw in the <HI>Gouty</HI> Hu∣mour on the Stomach) and by their not rendering him more hot and restless, than the <HI>Gout</HI> it self wou'd naturally make him: For if they produce an agreeable Sensation on the Stomach, and do not inflame, they will necessarily procure Coolness and Quiet.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XIX" UNIT="§."/> Here it may be considered, whe∣ther <HI>Opiats</HI> may be safely given in a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> to procure Rest, and alleviate Pain. In the general, it is the safest side, not to administer any kind of <HI>Opiats</HI> in the Fits; because they constantly pall the Ap∣petite, and leave a Nauseating, and per∣haps a Reaching on the Stomach, the readiest way to bring the <HI>Gout</HI> there. But in Extremities, when the Patient has been many Days without Rest, and the Pain becomes intolerable, all other Means fail∣ing, or equally Dangerous, <HI>Opiats</HI> may be so qualify'd, and their mischievous Effects so bridled, by joining spicy, nervous and
<PB N="22" REF="34"/>Stomach Medicines to them, that they may become an excellent Remedy. Thus liquid <HI>Laudanum,</HI> with Tincture of <HI>Castor,</HI> of Snakeweed, of <HI>Diambra,</HI> of Saffron, <HI>Sal Volatile,</HI> Compound Spirit of Laven∣der, Hysterick Water, and some agreea∣ble simple Water; some of these mix'd in a due Proportion, and proper Dose, will not only procure Rest, and ease Pain, but answer all the other Intentions in the Cure of a Fit of the <HI>Gout.</HI> Thus also, <HI>London Laudanum,</HI> with old <HI>Venice</HI> Treacle, or <HI>Mythridate,</HI> Serpentary Root, and unscen∣ted Species of <HI>Diambra</HI> made into a <HI>Bo∣lus,</HI> with any agreeable Syrup, and cau∣tion'd, as before, will produce the same Effect.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XX" UNIT="§."/> As soon as the Pain is almost gone, and the Swelling and Weakness only re∣main, nothing will more quicken and fi∣nish the Cure, and strengthen the wea∣ken'd Parts, than gentle, warm, stoma∣chick and spicy Purgers, dos'd and repeat∣ed according to the Strength of the Pa∣tient; by carrying out of the Habit, the more gross and unperspirable Remains of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour. This premis'd, espe∣cially after long and severe Fits, which
<PB N="23" REF="35"/>have impair'd the Strength, and wasted the Muscular Flesh; I should advise Asses Milk with Pearl, half a Pint, or a Pint, in the Morning early, and five or six a Clock in the Afternoon; to lengthen out the Morning Sleep, to pulp up the ex∣hausted Muscles, to cool and refresh the parch'd <HI>Fibres,</HI> and keep the Body solu∣ble; which Asses Milk commonly does. And to keep up the Appetite, which the Milk commonly palls, and to prevent its too cooling Effects on the Stomach, a light Bitter made of Gentian, Cinnamon, and Orange Peel only, the last double of the other two, infus'd in Sherry or White Wine, and taken two Hours before Meals, may be us'd most conveniently. This Course might be continued for two or three Weeks: After which I shou'd or∣der a Course of <HI>Bath</HI> or <HI>German Spaw</HI> Waters, with Steel, riding, a light White∣food Diet, and generous Wines drunk temperately.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXI" UNIT="§."/> It is in the Intervals of the Fits that any thing great or probable is to be undertaken for the Relief or Cure of the <HI>Gouty.</HI> The Methods, both general and particular, I have touch'd upon. I come
<PB N="24" REF="36"/>now to recommend some special Medi∣cines, which have been found useful in this Case. It is certain that great Absti∣nence from Flesh, Fish, and Wines, would prevent the Fluids from being overloaded with <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts. It is also certain, that if the Food be carried out before it is di∣gested, it will be pretty near the same Thing, as if the Quantity carry'd out, had not been taken down. Now if a Medicine can be found, that without weakening the Stomach and Bowels, shall carry off the greater part of the Food, before it is quite robb'd of its Salts, it can't fail to be of great Use in the Inter∣vals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> For this Purpose, I wou'd recommend fine Rhubarb, taken regular∣ly once, twice, or oftner a Week, in such a Dose, as to procure two or three Mo∣tions: For these Reasons, <HI>First,</HI> Because it is an excellent Stomach Bitter, as is e∣vident from its Taste, and from the sharp Appetite it gives those that take it fre∣quently. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Because it is one of the noblest Astringents hitherto known, as is evident from its Cure of Fluxes, and intestine <HI>Haemorrhages;</HI> and from the Tightness it leaves on the Bowels. <HI>Third∣ly,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="37"/>Because it requires neither Diet, nor keeping warm, nor any other particular Management; and yet taken frequently and regularly, it will carry off any Pro∣portion of the Food one pleases; and so reduce the Dier, as near as needs be, to <HI>Cornaro's,</HI> which, in Article XIII, has been shewn to be of so excellent Use in the <HI>Gout.</HI> I knew a Noble Lord, of great Worth, and much <HI>Gout,</HI> who, by taking from the Hands of a Quack, a Dram of Rhubarb, ting'd with <HI>Cochineal</HI> to disguise it, every Morning for the Space of six Weeks, liv'd in Health for four Years after, with∣out any Symptom of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXII" UNIT="§."/> It is worth here taking Notice, that all the Preparations of this Medicine serve only to spoil it. And that it is best taken in a spoonful of Soup, or any other agreeable Liquor, immediately before Din∣ner, or chew'd in a Morning fasting. But to those to whom its Mawkishness is nau∣seous, I would recommend this Form. <HI>Take</HI> Gentian <HI>and</HI> Zedoary <HI>of each a Dram,</HI> Serpentary <HI>Root, and unscented Species of</HI> Diambra, <HI>of each half a Dram.</HI> Cochineal <HI>and</HI> Saffron <HI>of each a Scruple;</HI> Orange Peel <HI>an Ounce: infuse in a Quart of Moun∣tain
<PB N="26" REF="38"/>in a warm place twenty four Hours, strain, and to the Liquor add three Ounces of the best</HI> Rhubarb; Salt of Wormwood <HI>a Dram and half: set in a warm Sand heat twelve Hours; and then strain a second time.</HI> Of this four Spoonfuls every Night, or e∣very other Night, as occasion requir'd, I have found an excellent Remedy in this and other Chronical Cases. Where no Preparations of Rhubarb will agree with the Constitution, as there are many such, then <HI>Elixir Salutis,</HI> Tincture of <HI>Hiera Pi∣cra;</HI> a Solution of <HI>Gum Guajac,</HI> or the <HI>Scot∣tish</HI> Pills, might take place; but that all the preparations of <HI>Aloes</HI> are apt to throw out both <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Piles.</HI> However in this matter there is great Variety; out of which every one may fit themselves with what is most agreeable to their own Con∣stitution; which if they use regularly and frequently, they cannot fail to prevent violent Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> and perhaps most other, both Acute and Chronical Distem∣pers.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXIII" UNIT="§."/> Next to Rhubarb, and all Cir∣cumstances consider'd, even far before it, I would recommend <HI>Sulphur,</HI> as one of the best Remedies in the Intervals of
<PB N="27" REF="39"/>the <HI>Gout.</HI> It is but in little Use at pre∣sent in Physick, except in the <HI>Itch,</HI> and the <HI>Piles;</HI> and yet in the whole Extent of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> I know not a more safe and more active Medicine. Its won∣derful Efficacy, and particular manner of Operating in these common Cases, might, I think, have encourag'd its Trial in o∣ther Chronical Cases, especially consider∣ing the Facility of its Working, and the little Trouble it gives in taking it. Its principal Qualities are these. 1. The Parts of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and those of Light and Fire, act mutually upon one another, more powerfully than those of other Bodies. It is to their <HI>Sulphur</HI> that Bodies owe re∣flecting and refracting Virtues; from whence its Inflammability proceeds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Sir</HI> Isaac Newton's <HI>Treatise of Light and Colours,</HI> 1 <HI>Edit. in</HI> English <HI>towards the end.</HI></NOTE> The Particles of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies receive and retain those of Light and Fire, more strong∣ly than any other Bodies: And the Rays of Light and Particles of Fire, separate, move and turn the Parts of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bo∣dies into Fire and Flame. 2. The Parts of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies are very small, even smaller than those of Water it self, where∣by
<PB N="28" REF="40"/>it comes to pass that they will enter those small Vessels, where Water it self (our best and most universal Diluent) can't come; this is evident from hence, that Water will not dissolve <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and that no Moisture will stick to fat Substan∣ces, or the Feathers of Water Fowl: As also from its cure of all cutaneous Foul∣ness; which it cou'd never effectuate but by entering all those smallest Vessels, which scarce any other Medicine can en∣ter. And <HI>lastly,</HI> by its dissolving the sizy Juices of the smallest internal <HI>Glands,</HI> when obstructed; particularly those of the <HI>Lungs, Mesentery</HI> and <HI>Rectum;</HI> as in the humorous <HI>Asthma, Scrophula</HI> and <HI>Piles.</HI> 3. <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies will readily unite with, and destroy the Effects of all <HI>Saline</HI> Parti∣cles, but especially those of the acid kind. And in this their great Energy seems to consist. <HI>Sulphur</HI> yields the most piercing, active, and agreeable <HI>Acid</HI> in the World; such as Spirit of <HI>Sulphur, Gas</HI> of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and the like. 4. The fat and oily Parts of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> like other fat and unctuous Bodies, are the lightest, the most cohe∣rent, and the most springy of all Bodies. These two last Qualities are most manifest
<PB N="29" REF="41"/>from the artificial <HI>Sulphur</HI> made of Oyl of Turpentine and Spirit of <HI>Vitriol</HI> (the strongest Glew, and the most penetrating Acid) duly digested and carefully manag'd, which in all respects is the same with na∣tural <HI>Sulphur.</HI><Q>No Body denies (says <HI>Tournefort</HI> in his Voyage to the <HI>Levant,</HI> Pag. 122. Part I. <HI>English</HI> Edit.) that <HI>Sulphur</HI> is only a fat Substance, fix'd by an acid Spirit: The <HI>Sulphur</HI> which is artificially made, and the <HI>Analysis</HI> of common <HI>Sulphur,</HI> put this Truth out of all Dispute. For the Sea Water be∣ing fat by the Oil of the Sea Fish conti∣nually corrupting there, and bitter and saltish from its saline Rocks, produces in proper Nests natural <HI>Sulphur.</HI></Q> And Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> says, in his last Edition of his Opticks, <HI>pag.</HI> 359. <Q>By dissolv∣ing Flower of Brimstone in Oil of Tur∣pentine, and distilling the Solution, it is found, that <HI>Sulphur</HI> is compos'd of an inflammable thick Oil, or fat <HI>Bitu∣men,</HI> an acid Salt, a very thick Earth, and a little Metal: The three first were found not much unequal to one ano∣ther; the fourth in so small a Quantity, as scarce to be worth the considering.</Q>
<PB N="30" REF="42"/>Join all these Qualities together, and you have one of the most admirable Remedies in the World, for all Intentions in the Cure of the <HI>Gout:</HI> By its agreeable Taste and Lightness on the Stomach, (especial∣ly when wash'd down with any milky Ve∣hicle) its Tenacity, Ropiness and Elasti∣city; the smallness of its Parts; their Ef∣ficacy in destroying the Mischief of all sa∣line Particles, with their natural Warmth, join'd to the Activity of its acid Salt, (making it a kind of natural Soap) it en∣ters the small Vessels, where no other Diluent, hitherto known, can come; cleanses their insides from the Foulness that sticks to them; imbibes and retains all the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, and carries them out of the Body by Perspiration; softens, smooths and relaxes the parch'd and stif∣fen'd <HI>Fibres;</HI> and by leaving some of its oily Parts on their Surfaces, sheaths and defends them from the Points of the Salts afterwards introduc'd. And the Fact is, from repeated Trials I can recommend <HI>Sulphur,</HI> as a most powerful Remedy in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> For I have known half a Dram of powder'd <HI>Sulphur,</HI> or Flowers of Brimstone, taken regularly
<PB N="31" REF="43"/>twice a Day in a Spoonful of Milk, pre∣vent the Fit for many Years; and lessen both its Pain and Duration when it hap∣pen'd: For it mov'd the Body gently once or twice a Day. I have in my Possession Testimonies under the Hands of some treated and tended by my self; and of o∣thers of undoubted Credit, witnessing to the great Success of this Medicine in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> Nothing hither∣to discover'd, I believe, equals it obsti∣nately persisted in.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXIV" UNIT="§."/> Especially if to these be added plentiful Dilution by some Blood-warm Infusion of a spicy and diuretick Plant in Water, so as to provoke a gentle Brea∣thing Sweat, and pass freely by Urine. Thus large Draughts of Sage, Dwarf-El∣der, Buckbean, or Green Tea; but espe∣cially of weak Whey made on old Moun∣tain, drunk Blood warm, and on an empty Stomach, and join'd to any of the now mention'd Medicines, will be of great Ad∣vantage in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout;</HI> by diluting and breaking its Salts, and car∣rying them off by Perspiration and Urine. And certainly <HI>Roselli</HI>'s Drops, (perhaps the <HI>Tinctura Metallorum</HI> somehow alter'd)
<PB N="32" REF="44"/>which were said to work gently by Stool and Sweat, in the Hands of a prudent and knowing Physician, had been an admira∣ble Remedy, as answering both the Inten∣tions mention'd, in the Intervals of the Fits; and even in the Fits themselves, it had not been without its Use (always except∣ing the <HI>Vernal</HI> and <HI>Autumnal</HI> regular Fits) had he dealt with recent <HI>Gouts,</HI> and firm Constitutions only. That which I wou'd particularly recommend here, is, a weak Decoction of the <HI>BARK</HI> of <HI>Sarsa</HI> Root (in the <HI>BARK</HI> the Virtues of the Plants chiefly consist: For being replenish'd with most part of, if not all the Juice-circulat∣ing Vessels, it contains all its Salts and most active Parts; and being Spungy and Tender, it is thereby more easily digested: And where Roots are most in Use, the <HI>Bark</HI> of the Root is more eminently use∣ful, for the Reasons assign'd: As also because, towards the End of the <HI>Autumn,</HI> when Roots are gather'd, the Cold has already driven the Juices into their <HI>Bark.</HI> And this may be one Reason why the fa∣mous Pox-Doctor succeeds in some Cases, when mismanag'd <HI>Mercurial</HI> Treatments have fail'd: His Diet-Drink chiefly con∣sists
<PB N="33" REF="45"/>of a Decoction of the Bark of this Root: His Pill is <HI>Mercurial,</HI> perhaps the <HI>Arcanum Corallinum,</HI> or <HI>Panacaea,</HI> and these two persisted in for so long a Time, must necessarily sweeten the tainted Juices, and expel the entangled and grosser <HI>Mer∣curial</HI> Parts, which clustering together, cou'd not perform the Circulation, but were retain'd within the Habit, by for∣mer mismanag'd Salivations, and thereby render'd ineffectual to the Cure; especial∣ly, if to these be added, the low and star∣ving Diet he prescribes. For I have heard of a famous Sea-Commander, who effect∣ually cur'd the first Stages of <HI>Venereal</HI> Di∣stempers by living twenty Days on <HI>Water Gruel</HI> only, in which a little <HI>Cream</HI> of <HI>Tartar</HI> had been first dissolv'd; (and high∣er Degrees of the same by the like Diet continu'd twice the Time;) with a little Milk, drunk freely Blood warm every Morning, which I have known wonder∣fully relieve <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons, when drunk all the Winter between the <HI>Cardinal</HI> Fits. And even Cow's Milk warm, taken for Breakfast and Supper, has been of great Service to those <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons who drink
<PB N="34" REF="46"/>not much Wine; for those who drink Wine freely, have too hot and sour Sto∣machs to deal in Milk.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXV" UNIT="§."/> Even drinking freely of light, clear Spring Water after full Meals, and indulging in strong Liquors, will be found of great Use in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> It is well known that warm Water alone, drunk in a Morning fasting freely, and at Meals, from its Heat, its Dilution, and cleansing Qualities, has been a sovereign Remedy in restoring decay'd Appetites, and strengthning weak Digestions, when other more pompous Medicines have fail'd. <HI>Low∣er</HI> very justly observes, that Persons that have drunk beyond the Rules of Tempe∣rance, may be much reliev'd from the ill Effects of it, by exposing themselves to the free Air, to cool the Blood, and to force off the Liquors by Urine. I'm of Opinion, were there neither Sin nor Shame in it, as there are eminently both, a <HI>Gouty</HI> Person ought to avoid Intemperance, as he wou'd avoid the Bite of a Snake or mad Dog. But since such Accidents do hap∣pen, let the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person, after the Ex∣cess either in Meat or Drink, swill down as much fair Water as his Stomach will
<PB N="35" REF="47"/>bear, before he go to bed; whereby he'll reap these Advantages: <HI>First,</HI> Either the Contents of the Stomach will be thrown upwards, and he freed from a great part of the Load. Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Both Meat and Drink will be much dilu∣ted; and the Labour and Expence of Spi∣rits in Digestion much sav'd. And <HI>Third∣ly,</HI> the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts will thereby be dissolv'd and distanc'd from one another; and so be more readily carry'd off by the free Perspiration, Sweating and Urine which ensue.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXVI" UNIT="§."/> But beyond all other Things, a well order'd Course of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, with <HI>Chalybeats</HI> and warm Bitters, and a frequent and regular Use of Stomach Pur∣gers will be found to succeed best in <HI>Gouty,</HI> as well as other Chronical Cases. The Learn'd have been divided, and much perplex'd about the Heat of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. I have always endeavour'd to account to my self for it, from the common Experi∣ment of mixing filings of <HI>Steel,</HI> and Pow∣der of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> working them into a Paste with Water, and putting them in a Cellar, under a Cock, dropping Water slowly and regularly; the Paste will ferment to
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>such a degree, that the Water running from it shall be of the same Heat and Virtue with the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters; tho' not so pleasant, nor so well fitted to human Bodies. This is a common Experiment, and these are the only natural Bodies known, which meeting together will pro∣duce Heat in Water, without artificial Fires. <HI>Tournefort,</HI> in the Place before men∣tion'd, says, <Q>Its certain that Filings of Iron steep'd in common Water will grow considerably warm, and much more so in Sea Water: And if you mingle therewith some <HI>Sulphur</HI> pow∣der'd, you'll see this Mixture really burn.</Q> Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> in his last Edition of his Opticks, <HI>pag.</HI> 354, says, <Q>That even the gross Body of <HI>Sulphur</HI> powder'd, and with an equal Weight of Iron filings, and a little Water made into a Paste, acts upon the Iron; and in five or six Hours grows too hot to be touch'd, and emits a Flame.</Q> That the Heat of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters is owing to a Principle within themselves, is evident, from their retaining it longer than any o∣ther Water, heated to the same Degree, will. Wherefore there can be no Necessity
<PB N="37" REF="49"/>of having Recourse to <HI>Vulcano</HI>'s or subter∣raneous Fires, to account for this Appear∣ance. There are no burning Mountains known in this our <HI>Northern</HI> Climate; and 'tis pretty hard to conceive, how Fires shou'd have burn'd so long under Ground without a Vent, or any other remarkable Sign. The <HI>Sulphur</HI> in the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters is evident to the Senses, swimming in large Clusters on the Tops of the <HI>Baths</HI> mix'd with Earth, and some vegetable Sub∣stances, wherewith the Guides commonly gild Silver; and is found an excellent Re∣medy in <HI>Scurvies, Leprosies, Ring-worms,</HI> and other <HI>Foulnesses</HI> of the Skin. The Steel is manifested by the blewish Tincture given to the Water from the Pump, by an Infusion of Nut-gall. It is true, this Tinct∣ure is neither so deep, nor is it to be had from the Water, in any short Time after it comes hot from the Pump, thereby to manifest any great Quantity of Steel in the Composition, such as can have the full Proportion to the Experiment now men∣tioned. But, to set this in a clearer Light, let us put together these Considerations. <HI>First,</HI> That upon Distillation of <HI>Bath</HI> Wa∣ter, there remains little in the Bottom of
<PB N="38" REF="50"/>the Glass, but the common <HI>Calx</HI> or Sea Salt, that is found in the Distillation of Spring Water, if we except some Sand or Earth, that is forc'd up by the Violence of the Pump; wherefore the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters not being impregnated with any Quantity of a saline Mixture, can retain nothing in their own proper Substance but the lightest Parts of the Steel and <HI>Sulphur. Secondly,</HI> That this Water is as fully impregnated with <HI>Sulphur,</HI> as it can bear, has been al∣ready shewn: And that there must be a greater Proportion of Steel in <HI>Bath</HI> Water than is manifested to the Senses, or dis∣cover'd by any Experiment hitherto made, is evident from its healing Effects, which no known Medicine but Steel can bring a∣bout, or account for: None but those who have seen it, can believe the wonder∣ful Efficacy it has, in most Chronical Ca∣ses. What, but Steel, in a few Weeks, can make the Blood, from a white blewish or Tallow Hue, resisting the Knife, like Glew, swimming in its <HI>Serum,</HI> like an Island amidst the Ocean, look all of a Piece, of a Scarlet Colour, and a due Proportion be∣tween its nourishing and its watery Parts? Nothing but Steel can make a pale ash-colour'd
<PB N="39" REF="51"/>Countenance, hollow and deep Eyes, no Appetite, little Strength, and less Sleep; eat, and drink, and sleep, look gay and sleek, like the best Health. Thousands of such Instances may be seen every Season at these healthful Springs. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Effects of <HI>Sulphur</HI> in brid∣ling the sensible Appearances and Opera∣tions of most active Medicines, is very well known. Instances of which, in na∣tural Bodies, are, <HI>Antimony</HI> and native <HI>Cin∣nabar;</HI> in artificial ones, <HI>Aethiops</HI> Mineral, and <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of <HI>Antimony:</HI> In all which the <HI>Mercury</HI> is so bridled up by the <HI>Sul∣phur,</HI> that none of their sensible Opera∣tions and Appearances are felt, while they produce the most wonderful Changes on animal Bodies. I cannot pass over <HI>Aethiops</HI> Mineral without pressing its more univer∣sal Use than, for ought I know, it has yet had in common Practice. It is one of the most certain and universal Alteratives, if dos'd sufficiently and long enough persisted in, of all the <HI>Dispensatory.</HI> It radically extirpates the Itch, the Piles, scorbutick and scrophulous Ulcers; all cutaneous Foulnesses; all Inflammations and Fluxions of the Eyes; all internal Ulcers, Rheuma∣tisms,
<PB N="40" REF="52"/>white Swellings; sharp Humours in the Stomach and Guts, and almost all Distempers arising from sizy Juices. I say, it cures these, if Art can do it; for some of these (like hereditary <HI>Gouts</HI>) are so transubstantiated into the Solids, that no∣thing but a new Conformation of Parts can cure them. It may be given almost to half an Ounce a Day, especially with interspers'd <HI>Mercurial</HI> Purges, without Trouble, or any sensible Operation, and continu'd for a Twelve-Month, if one plea∣ses. The finest <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and fittest to make <HI>Aethiops</HI> of, is common <HI>Sulphur</HI> pou∣der'd, and boiled seven or eight Times in Spring Water, whereby it becomes as light on the Stomach as prepared Pearl, and as effectual in the Cases mentioned, as the celebrated <HI>Sulphur</HI> of <HI>Aix la Chappelle</HI> Waters. But to return to the Business.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXVII" UNIT="§."/> The sum of all then is, since the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters derive their Heat from a Principle within themselves; since no natural Body, but <HI>Sulphur</HI> and Iron can pro∣duce such a Degree of Heat, as is in them; since nothing but Steel can produce those wonderful Cures on human Bodies, which <HI>Bath</HI> Waters do; since <HI>Sulphur</HI> will lock up
<PB N="41" REF="53"/>and bridle the sensible Appearances and Ef∣fects of the most active Bodies, and yet not destroy their healthful and medical virtues; it is plain, that <HI>Bath</HI> Waters must owe their Heat to a Mixture of steely and sulphurous Particles; and their healthful Effects to a greater Proportion of Steel, than is sensible, or easily discoverable by any Experiment hitherto made, join'd to a light <HI>Sulphur,</HI> whose Virtues and Efficacy in all Chronical Cases, we have already shewn. The Moun∣tains which surround the Place, which eve∣ry Body now knows, to be but the Nests of Minerals, and the Receptacles of the Wa∣ters, which feed the Springs, (which Moun∣tains are continued even to the Sea) confirm this Opinion. The manner I conceive thus: The Dews drilling and dropping through the Cranies of the Mountains, fall upon a Bed of Iron Oar, and are there as fully im∣pregnated with <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Particles as such Water can bear; and gently owzing down upon a Nest of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and there ferment∣ing to such a degree, that requiring more room, they bubble up at the Foot of the Mountains, with their sulphurous Spoils, and furnish out this healing and balsamick Fluid. All hot Waters seem chiefly to con∣sist
<PB N="42" REF="54"/>of these two Principles; and to differ on∣ly as the <HI>Sulphur</HI> or <HI>Steel</HI> predominates in them. Where the <HI>Sulphur</HI> predominates, they are hotter, more nauseous, and more purgative. Of the three hot <HI>European</HI> Wa∣ters of Note, the <HI>Aix la Chapelle, Bourbon,</HI> and <HI>Bath;</HI> the first abounds more eminently in <HI>Sulphur,</HI> which makes its Heat, Nause∣ousness and Purgative Faculty so great, that few weak Stomachs can bear its Heat and Nauseousness; and fewer weak Constituti∣ons, the Violence of its purging. The <HI>Bourbon</HI> are of a middle Nature, between the <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> and the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, and are less hot, nauseous and purgative than the <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> but more than the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. The <HI>Bath</HI> partake less of the <HI>Sul∣phur</HI> and more of the <HI>Steel</HI> than either of these two; and are by far the most pleasant; of a milky Taste, never purge, except they be drunk either too fast, or in too great Quantities, and always mend the Appetite, and raise the Spirits. The weakest hot Wa∣ters are but of little Use, except in the low∣est Cases, and in hectick or consumptive Constitutions; but for medical Uses, the weaker hot Waters may be made pretty near equal to the stronger by Evaporation, as to
<PB N="43" REF="55"/>the sulphurous Principle; as the stronger may be brought down to the weaker by Di∣lution, as I have experienc'd; tho' Nature be always the wisest and most perfect Ope∣rator. But neither the same Proportion of <HI>Steel,</HI> nor <HI>Sulphur,</HI> nor Heat, indifferently fit all Constitutions. Generally the Strength (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Quantity of <HI>Steel</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI>) of the same hot Waters is in proportion to their Heat; and therefore to fit the same Waters to weaker Constitutions, they need only be drunk proportionably cooler.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXVIII" UNIT="§."/> The <HI>Bath</HI> Waters having such an Origin, and such Qualities, must needs be an excellent Remedy in the <HI>Gout,</HI> and o∣ther Chronical Cases, for these Reasons; 1. Because of their Warmth, just suited to the Wants of Nature, and a little above the Heat of human Bodies, sufficient to intro∣duce a foreign Warmth and Motion to cold and decay'd Bowels and Fluids; whereby the natural Warmth and slow Circulation is encreas'd and enliven'd. 2. This, with its a∣greeable Taste and milky Softness, makes it sit so easily on the Stomach, and become so excellent a Vehicle, to wash into the Blood other proper and specifick Medi∣cines, without that Nauseousness and Fret
<PB N="44" REF="56"/>on the Spirits, which all other hot Waters, hitherto known; or that Chillyness and Damp, which all cold Mineral Waters, give: whereby they are render'd useless or hurtful in some low and nervous Cases. To these add, 3. Their <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Principle, so pecu∣liarly lock'd up in <HI>Sulphur,</HI> that the Patient reaps all the Benefit and healthful Effects of the best Preparations of this Medicine (and what are not two such powerful Medicines combin'd able to effect? (without the nau∣seous Taste, and frequent Disorders upon the Stomach, that every other way of giving <HI>Steel</HI> produces. 4. The <HI>Sulphur</HI> united with the <HI>Steel,</HI> makes it a natural kind of Soap, for cleansing the insides of the Vessels from the Foulness that cleaves to them; and for opening the Obstructions of the small Ves∣sels. But 5. That which, together with the others, makes it specifick in the <HI>Gout,</HI> is, its relaxing Quality, whereby it softens and supples the rigid and stiff <HI>Fibres,</HI> so as the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humours may pass freely by Perspira∣tion. Much more might be said of this won∣derful Remedy provided by the Hand of Nature, to relieve the Miseries of human Life; but this the innumerable Crowds of Cripples of all sorts, and those other Per∣sons
<PB N="45" REF="57"/>made miserable by Chronical Distem∣pers, sent thence, every Year, cur'd, or re∣liev'd, do witness, more convincingly than either Philosophy or Rhetorick can.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXIX" UNIT="§."/> I will here remove two Difficul∣ties: The <HI>First</HI> is, concerning Bathing in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> The only Reason given for this Difficulty is, lest the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour should be driven inwards upon the Bowels. But this seems to me a mere groundless Jealousy: For in regular <HI>Gouts,</HI> when the Fit is over, it is to be suppos'd, that the <HI>Gouty</HI> Fluid or Matter is mostly or altogether spent, and the Fluids in a healthy sound Condition. And therefore it might be as reasonably doubted, if in the Intervals of two putrid Fevers (of which many have had more than two in their Life-time) a Person might safely bath. There is no Question, but that a <HI>Gouty</HI> Person may both as safely bath, and take any Medicine, for any incident Disease, as any other Person; regard being had to his particular Consti∣tution. And 'tis Matter of Fact, that those who have been crippl'd by the fixing of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts upon the Joints, or disabl'd by the Tenderness of the Parts, have been ex∣tremely reliev'd by a long Course of drinking
<PB N="46" REF="58"/>and bathing in these hot Waters, which by relaxing the <HI>Fibres,</HI> dissolving the sizy Hu∣mours, diluting the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, and ma∣king them pass by Perspiration, have re∣stor'd them to the Use of their Limbs.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXX" UNIT="§."/> The other Difficulty is, how the same hot Water shou'd relax contracted <HI>Fibres,</HI> as in the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Rheumatism;</HI> and yet contract and brace relax'd <HI>Fibres,</HI> as in the Palsie and wasted Limbs. That the Matter of Fact is so, is past all Doubt in these and many other Cases of Contrac∣tion and Relaxation. But to clear up this, we need only to consider what Contraction and Relaxation are. Since all the Fluids of the Body are contain'd in Vessels, Con∣traction can arise from nothing but from the Blood and other Fluids (or whatever is the Cause of Muscular Motion) Their being retain'd and obstructed by their Si∣ziness; or from some external Injury, in the Substance of the Muscle it self; where∣by it becomes fuller and firmer, and so acts as upon its Office of Contraction. Relaxation, upon the other hand, is an Obstruction of the Nerves or Vessels of the Fluids, before they arrive at the Muscles; as is seen in Palsies and the Nervous <HI>A∣trophy</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="59"/>of the Limbs; so that in both Ca∣ses, Obstructions are the Cause both of Contraction and Relaxation. Wherefore, whatever Medicine can dissolve the Sizi∣ness of the Fluids; open the Obstructions of the small Vessels; make the Perspira∣tion full and free, and brace the <HI>Fibres;</HI> will both contract Relaxations, and relax Contractions: And that these are some of the Effects of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, has, I think, been made sufficiently appear.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXI" UNIT="§."/> If it be enquir'd into, what o∣ther Cases, besides the <HI>Gout, Bath</HI> Waters may be useful in; the Answer will be ob∣vious from the Account now laid down; to wit, That they must be beneficial in all Cases, where <HI>Steel</HI> or <HI>Sulphur</HI> is; that is, in almost all Chronical Cases whatsoever. In Acute and Inflammatory Cases, in all Ca∣ses attended with a strong, quick Pulse, no <HI>Mineral</HI> Water, nor <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Medi∣cine can be proper. But in all other Ca∣ses (excepting those only attended with a Bleeding or <HI>Haemorrhage</HI>) they are not on∣ly safe, but exceedingly beneficial. More particularly, their wonderful Efficacy has been often experienc'd in <HI>Cachexies, Scur∣vies;</HI> in the <HI>Stone, Rheumatism</HI> and <HI>Jaun∣dice;</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="60"/>in <HI>Hypocondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hysterical</HI> Af∣fections; in <HI>Vapours</HI> and <HI>Melancholy;</HI> in <HI>Palsies, Epilepsies,</HI> and other <HI>Cephalick</HI> and <HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers; in Disorders of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Bowels;</HI> Obstructions of the <HI>Liver</HI> and <HI>Gall-bladder;</HI> in <HI>green</HI> and <HI>bree∣ding</HI> Sicknesses; in <HI>Barrenness</HI> and <HI>Weakness</HI> after Child-birth; in Obstructions of the <HI>Monthly</HI> Purgations; and all other pecu∣liar Diseases of the <HI>Sex.</HI> And truly, if a Person afflicted with a low, broken or ten∣der Constitution, suffering under the te∣dious Pains and Inquietudes of any of the lingering Distempers now mention'd, where the <HI>Viscera</HI> or Bowels are yet sound, wou'd know the fittest Place in <HI>Britain</HI> to spend their Life-time with the greatest Ease and Pleasure; take all the Advanta∣ges of the Place together, the Agreeable∣ness of the Waters to the Stomach; the Certainty of their procuring a good Appe∣tite, when it fails, and the no less certain Consequence thereupon, Freedom and Chearfulness of Spirits; the regular way of living; the Excellency of the Provisions; the Warmness, Cleanness and Neatness of the Housing; the Conveniency of the free, fresh and open Air of the neighbouring
<PB N="49" REF="61"/>Downs for Exercise; the Easiness of the Amusements; and the Advantage of what Conversation one desires; I say, taking all these Advantages together, I can affirm, from near twenty Years Experience, with∣out Suspicion of Flattery, or Fear of Con∣tradiction, that <HI>Bath</HI> is the Place.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXII" UNIT="§."/> Some wise and frugal People think the mere drinking of these Waters, for some Time, without taking any Medi∣cine, either before or with them, may be sufficient to remove any of the Chronical Ails they are good for; but those, if they are really ill, in any other Manner, except mere loss of Appetite, are generally con∣vinc'd, upon Trial, at their own Expence, that they neither ought to begin a Course of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, without a previous clean∣sing of the Stomach and Bowels, lest they wash into the Blood through the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> by the perpetual Dilution of the <HI>Bath</HI> Wa∣ters, those Impurities, which constantly cleave to them; nor that they ought to ex∣pect a perfect Cure of a long breeding and lingering Distemper, without the Assistance of those other Medicines which are reckon'd Specifick in the Case; and to which the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters are so pleasant and so assistant a
<PB N="50" REF="62"/>Vehicle. For it is but Prudence to bring all the Forces one can raise, against so po∣tent and so formidable an Enemy as a Chro∣nical Distemper.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXIII" UNIT="§."/> It is not possible to lay down a general Rule, about the Quantity of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, which it is convenient to drink daily; that being to be varied according to some Circumstances of the Patient, and the Nature of the Distemper: Strong, full and large Bodies bear more Waters than tender, thin and lesser ones, the younger more than the elder; those of strong and firm, than those of weak and relax'd <HI>Nerves;</HI> those who labour under the <HI>Gravel</HI> and <HI>Rheumatism,</HI> than those who are disorder'd in the <HI>Alimen∣tary</HI> Passages, or are subject to <HI>Scorbutick</HI> or <HI>Nerv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> Weaknesses, and the like. But in general, it were to be wish'd, that <HI>People</HI> who come to <HI>Bath</HI> for their Healths, drunk less daily than they commonly do; and al∣low'd more Time for a Chronical Distem∣per. I think it may be safely advanc'd, That any Quantity greater than an <HI>English Quart,</HI> in a Morning, drunk in two Hours Time, half a Pint every half Hour, is more than what is reasonable. For, drinking in this Proportion, all the rest of the Day; at
<PB N="51" REF="63"/>Meals, <HI>to wit,</HI> in the Afternoon, and going to Bed, they must take down no less than five Pounds in about sixteen Hours; <HI>viz.</HI> two Pounds in the Morning, a Pint and an half with Wine at Dinner, half a Pound in the Afternoon, and as much at Supper and at going to Bed. This every Body must see is fully sufficient to answer all the Inten∣tions of drinking <HI>Mineral</HI> Waters. A grea∣ter Quantity than this will serve only to di∣stend and <HI>relax</HI> the Alimentary Passages; to force its way through the largest, and most patent <HI>Tubes;</HI> and to propagate the Circu∣lation through the Branches and <HI>Inoscula∣tions</HI> of the larger Arteries and Veins, where the least Foulness and fewest Obstruc∣tions can happen: So that it will scarce ever reach the finest Capillary Vessels, in which alone the Danger lies. And the late <HI>Inge∣nious</HI> and <HI>Learned Doctor James Keill</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pag. 49.</HI> Tent am. Medico-Physic. Jac. Keill.</NOTE> has made it evident, that the most expeditious way of altering the whole Mass of the Blood, by <HI>Mineral</HI> Waters, is, by small and frequent Draughts. In most Cases a <HI>Pint</HI> in a Morning is sufficient, and in low Constitutions and Disorders in the Alimen∣tary Passages, tending to Vomiting and
<PB N="52" REF="64"/>Purging, <HI>half a Pint</HI> is enough; and what∣ever Quantity is to be drunk, 'tis always best to take it in small Quantities, and at good Distances, provided it come within the Compass of the Morning. What is drunk at Meals, tho' cold, yet being fresh, and not altogether drain'd of its Principles and Virtues, contributes near as much to the Cure, as that which is taken in the Mor∣ning. The Afternoon and Evening's Draughts are more <HI>Arbitrary,</HI> and must de∣pend upon the Observation of the Patient, as he finds them agreeable to his Stomach, and sit easily or not: Where too great Quantities have not been swallow'd down in a Morning, they are very proper, pro∣vided they be in Proportion to the Mor∣ning's Quantity, and never taken under four or five Hours after Dinner; and that at Night, not under two or three Hours af∣ter Supper; these Times being the most proper to assist the Digestion, and carry off the Remains of the Food. But the Truth is, as nothing is more necessary, in a Course of these Waters, than setting out right at first; so nothing requires more the Experience and Judgment of a Physician, than the accommodating the previous Pre∣parations,
<PB N="53" REF="65"/>the Quantities to be drunk, and the Medicines to be taken with them, to the Distemper and the Constitution of the Pati∣ent. For these once settl'd, the rest gene∣rally goes on successfully.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXIV" UNIT="§."/> I come now, in the last place, to make a few Observations upon irregular <HI>Gouts.</HI> When the original Constitution is broken and impair'd; the Parts subdu'd and full of <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts; the Force of the Circu∣lation, by Age and frequent Fits, weaken'd, and continu'd only through the Inosculati∣ons of the great Vessels; the Humour re∣coils inwardly upon the Bowels. And this is call'd an irregular <HI>Gout.</HI> While it is in any Joynt, or any <HI>Muscular</HI> Part, it is still e∣steem'd regular, tho' the nearer it comes to those outward Parts, the least remote from the Heart and Bowels, the nearer it comes to an irregular one, and so consequently to its last and fatal Stages. To which it seldom comes unattended; for it generally brings the <HI>Stone</HI> along with it: Of which it mayn't be amiss to make this one Observation, to wit,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXV" UNIT="§."/> That the Chalk-stones voided from the Joynts of <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons, and the Gravel Stones found in the Bladders of such
<PB N="54" REF="66"/>as were afflicted with this Distemper (per∣haps the Stones found sometimes in the Gall-bladder, but of this I can affirm no∣thing) are, to all their essential Qualities, the same. They have both the same Co∣lour, Taste and Smell; they yield both the same Principles, and produce the same Ap∣pearances, when treated chymically. They have both the same internal Texture of Parts, as far as can be known, and even the same outward Shape, when unbroken and unconfin'd by hard Substances; and they generally happen to one and the same Per∣son: At least it seldom comes to pass, that any one is much troubl'd with the <HI>Gout,</HI> but he has the <HI>Stone</HI> at last. And this shews that they are both owing to the same Conforma∣tion of Parts, and other general Causes. It is true, some have suffer'd violently by the <HI>Stone,</HI> who never had the <HI>Gout;</HI> but this may be owing to a special, hereditary Nar∣rowness and Stiffness of the Urinary Passa∣ges, in respect of the other Vessels; and a particular unhappy Texture of Parts, as it happens to some other Organs in other Per∣sons: For fat People have smaller Vessels in proportion to their Stature than lean. But in the general, it is pretty constant,
<PB N="55" REF="67"/>that those who suffer long under severe Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> seldom escape the <HI>Stone.</HI> Dr. <HI>Cyprianus,</HI> the late ingenious Cutter for the <HI>Stone,</HI> had observ'd, that those who on∣ly drunk Malt Liquor were seldom ever vio∣lently afflicted with that Distemper: And among many hundreds he had cut, he had never found one, who had only drunk Ale or Beer. Whether this was owing to the lesser Quantity of Salts in those Liquors than in Wine, or to the Slipperiness they induce upon the Bowels and other Vessels, or to both, I will not here take upon me to determine. But I believe the Fact is, both in the <HI>Stone</HI> and acquired <HI>Gouts,</HI> that those who only drink Malt Liquors, without Wine or Spirits, are seldom violently afflic∣ted with either. And for the same Reasons it comes to pass, that the <HI>Gouts</HI> and <HI>Gravels</HI> of the Sex, are seldom so severe as in Men; they generally drinking less Wine, and feeding less of Fish and Flesh Meats. And that in the <HI>Gouts,</HI> both of Men and Wo∣men, who drink no Wine nor Spirits, any little proper Medicine has entirely kept off the Pain, and prevented the Fits. I know an antient Gentleman, formerly treated pretty roughly by the <HI>Gout,</HI> who drinking
<PB N="56" REF="68"/>only Malt Liquors, has, for several Years, with certain Success, entirely kept off the Pains and Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> by taking only every Morning, regularly, a Pint of warm White-wine Whey, to encourage Perspira∣tion: Which when he neglects to do, they as certainly return. We may therefore con∣clude, 1. That since the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Gravel</HI> Stones are, as to their essential Qualities, much the same; and since 'tis hardly possi∣ble to account for the breeding of the <HI>Stone,</HI> but from a particular Narrowness and Stiff∣ness of the Urinary Vessels, and an Abun∣dance of such Salts in the Fluids; it is high∣ly probable, that the <HI>Gout</HI> must proceed from the same general Causes: And this is some kind of Confirmation of the two first Propositions laid down in the beginning of this Discourse. 2. The same Method and Medicines that have been deduc'd from the first two Propositions, for relieving <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons, in the Intervals of the Fits, will likewise serve for preventing the Encrease of the <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel;</HI> as we are certain they do from the best Experience and Prac∣tice in this Case. I will now go on with my purpose, and consider an irregular <HI>Gout,</HI> fix'd on these three great Instruments of hu∣man
<PB N="57" REF="69"/>Life, the <HI>Head</HI> the <HI>Stomach,</HI> and <HI>Guts.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXV" UNIT="§."/> When the <HI>Gout</HI> has seiz'd on the Head, it is to be treated as any other vi∣olent Head-ach, or as an Inflammation on the Brain, or its Membranes; by Bleeding at the Arm or <HI>Jugular;</HI> Cupping on the Back; Blistering between the Shoul∣ders, but especially on the Ancles, to give the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour a Vent downwards. In young and strong Constitutions, <HI>Mercurial</HI> and <HI>Antimonial</HI> Vomits will do Wonders, tho' they are seldom to be ventur'd upon in any Constitution above Forty. The Inten∣tion here to be had in View (as in all other irregular <HI>Gouts</HI>) is to expel the <HI>Gouty</HI> Hu∣mour outwardly upon the Muscles or Joynts, and to fix it there. Wherefore in order to carry it to as great a Distance from the no∣ble Organs as may be, a free Passage is to be open'd to it on the Limbs, by blistering the Ancles and Wrists; and to promote its Con∣veyance thither, gentle Stomach Purgers are to be pour'd down continually, two or three Spoonfuls every third Hour, 'till the Effect is obtain'd. And for this end, I re∣commend principally Tincture of <HI>Hiera Picra</HI> with, compound Spirit of <HI>Lavender,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="70"/>and a few Drops of Tincture of <HI>Snake-weed,</HI> and Tincture of <HI>Diambra,</HI> as being one of the most powerful Expellents, and an excel∣lent Strengthner of the Stomach and Bow∣els. Its common Mischief is little to be minded here, for the forcing Blood or the Piles will carry the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour along with it; and these Disorders are but Trifles in respect of an irregular <HI>Gout.</HI> This Me∣thod will either spend the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour, or turn it to a regular Fit. But here Care is to be taken that the Medicines be not too hot, especially in young sanguine Complexi∣ons, lest an Inflammation on the Brain, or its Membranes shou'd turn to a Phrenzy or Fever: but there is less Danger of this, because the <HI>Gout</HI> in the Head seldom hap∣pens to the younger, except through much and long Intemperance.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXVI" UNIT="§."/> The <HI>Gout</HI> in the Stomach is a common and less dangerous Case; for the <HI>Gout</HI> seldom comes on and goes off without touching there by the way. In the slight Touches of it, any little Stomach Purge will set it a packing. But it is more obstinate towards the Decline of Life; when it settles in a constant Pain, nauseating and kecking in the Stomach. Vomits are reckon'd dan∣gerous
<PB N="59" REF="71"/>in the <HI>Gout,</HI> lest they shou'd de∣rive the Humour on the Stomach: But there can be room for no such a Suspicion here. Wherefore upon the first Seizure of the Sto∣mach, a Vomit is instantly to be admini∣stred, and repeated according to the occasi∣on of the Case: After that <HI>Hiera Picra</HI> as is before caution'd and qualify'd, with a hot <HI>Sinapism,</HI> or Blister oh the Ancles: And last of all, the highest Cordials, and most generous Wines, may be freely indulg'd, without fear of Inflammation. Among the Cordials, I would recommend the <HI>Electua∣rium de Ovo,</HI> as containing <HI>Camphir</HI> (the most constant and active <HI>Diaphoretic,</HI> and the most useful one for that purpose) and some other of the richest Cordials. After all this Management, should the <HI>Gout</HI> still continue in the Stomach and become habi∣tual (which it seldom does after such a Me∣thod taken in time) nothing but a long Course of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters with <HI>Steel,</HI> Bit∣ters, and gentle Stomach Purgers, a regu∣lar Diet, and proper Exercise, can effectu∣ally cure it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXVII" UNIT="§."/> The <HI>Gout</HI> in the Guts, on its first Seizure, may be easily treated, as a bi∣lious <HI>Cholic;</HI> only the <HI>Opiats,</HI> commonly
<PB N="60" REF="72"/>and justly given in the <HI>Cholic,</HI> are not here to be us'd, but in the last Extremity. But this Distemper ought to be treated altoge∣ther in the manner prescrib'd in the former Section, about the <HI>Gout</HI> in the Stomach.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXVIII" UNIT="§."/> There remains but one Dist∣inction more of the <HI>Gout,</HI> and one which has not hitherto been much consider'd: For as the <HI>Cholic</HI> or <HI>Asthma</HI> is, so the <HI>Gout</HI> may be, divided into the Humorous and <HI>Nervous;</HI> tho' this Distinction depends more upon the Complexion of the Patient, than the abstracted Nature of the Distem∣per. The Humorous <HI>Gout</HI> happens only to people of grosser Habits, more robust Constitutions, and more stiff and springy <HI>Fibres,</HI> and is the <HI>Gout</HI> which I have been hitherto treating. All I can further add to what has been said, is, that under the Fit, White Wines are more eligible than Red; because those part more readily with their Spirits, and are less astringent than these. And for the same Reason in the Intervals, the Red is preferable to the White: Tho' neither of them, in either Case, be useful or necessary, but because Custom or Habit, which it is not safe to alter suddenly, has made them so. For in all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em∣pire,
<PB N="61" REF="73"/>where little Flesh Meat, and no Wine is us'd; and in <HI>Spain,</HI> where they use them very moderately; and among the wild Mountaineers in the <HI>Northern</HI> Countries; and the lower Rank of the People in every Country, where they can procure neither, there is little or no <HI>Gout.</HI> Rubbing the Part affected with a soft Hand, or warm Napkin, as strongly as the Patient can bear it, is the ready way to make the Humour perspire in the Fit. And Cold Bathing, and rubbing with a Flesh Brush, Morning and Night, are some of the most certain outward Means, to bring Strength and Nourishment into it, in the Intervals.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXXIX" UNIT="§."/> Having mention'd Cold Ba∣thing, I am the more willing to set this so safe and universal a Mean, for the Recovery of the weaken'd Parts, after a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in a clearer Light; because a ground∣less Jealousy of the Danger of its throwing the <HI>Gout</HI> inwardly, has made it universally disus'd. Nothing made a greater Noise upon its first Restoration, and nothing cou'd have sunk lower in its Reputation since, than Cold Bathing: And it will al∣ways happen so in Things fitted to the vul∣gar Capacity, when they are universally
<PB N="62" REF="74"/>prescrib'd, without Distinction and without Choice. Those who know how greatly Foulness and Uncleanliness promote Epide∣mical, Pestilential and Infectious Distem∣pers, can only tell what Cleanness contri∣butes to Health. The <HI>Eastern</HI> People (whose Laziness, in other Things, is ow∣ing to their Climate) have found Cold Ba∣thing and Ablution so necessary to their Health, that they have made it a part of their Religion, as it is a Precept of a Reli∣gion of a nobler Extract, from whence they borrow'd it. If the modern Doctrine be true, as I really think it is, that the smallest <HI>Fibres,</HI> or those of the last Division, in ani∣mal Bodies, be not open and pervious, but solid; then it may be affirm'd, that warm Water (I mean pure Element, endu'd with no Medical Principle) by the active Power of its Heat, must necessarily relax such <HI>Fi∣bres.</HI> And that cold Water from the <HI>Nitre,</HI> which produces its Coldness, must necessa∣rily contract them. The Tumour of the <HI>Gout,</HI> like other inflammatory Swellings, is owing to an Obstruction, or to the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humours flowing faster by the <HI>Arteries,</HI> than it can be receiv'd by the Veins; the Smallest or Capillary Vessels are thereby
<PB N="63" REF="75"/>extended and stretch'd, beyond their natu∣ral Power of Restitution; so that when the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is spent by Perspiration, or driven into the Veins by the successive Stroaks of the Circulation; the Obstruction remov'd; and the Pain entirely gone off; the Vessels continue thus widen'd and stretch'd, beyond their Power of Restitu∣tion, for a long Time after. And this is the sole Cause of the long and tedious Weakness on the Part after the Fit is over; which wou'd yet continue longer, did not the Coolness and Pressure of the Ambient Air, and the now sufferable Weight of the Cloathing, give the first Impulses to the <HI>Fibres</HI> towards their contracting themselves again: Now nothing in Nature can so rea∣dily or so certainly bring this about, as Ba∣thing in cold Water: For the <HI>Nitre</HI> in the Water, which is the Cause of its Coolness; and also the uniform equal Pressure upon the Part, which arises from its Gravity and Flui∣dity, concur to communicate to the <HI>Fibres</HI> a strong and lasting Impulse towards restor∣ing themselves to their natural State of Con∣traction. And the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour now be∣ing spent, and the Obstruction entirely re∣mov'd, as is suppos'd, how can any such
<PB N="64" REF="76"/>Humour be translated upon another part, by cold Bathing, more than if the Person had never had the <HI>Gout?</HI> Now to make this Remedy still more effectual, after a pre∣vious Course of cold Bathing, cold Pump∣ing on the part, by the Force of a Pump, or the Fall of Water from a Height, may be conveniently us'd: The wonderful Efficacy of which is no less certain here, than it is in White Swellings on the Joints, where, I think, it is a never failing Remedy. I am very well inform'd of the Case of a very con∣siderable Person, who, for many Years be∣fore, being tormented with constant and uninterrupted Pains of the <HI>Gout,</HI> Summer and Winter, by daily bathing in a Tub of cold Water, has, for these several Years by-past, brought them to regular and peri∣odical Fits, at the Cardinal and Critical Sea∣sons only; and of no longer Duration than usual. I know also an ingenious Physician, who, after a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> goes daily into the cold Bath, till the part has recover'd its natural Strength, which constantly hap∣pens in much less Time than it wou'd do o∣therwise. And many others, who are con∣siderably strengthen'd, and preserv'd from catching Cold, by cold Bathing in the In∣tervals
<PB N="65" REF="77"/>of the <HI>Gout;</HI> tho' this Practice is ve∣ry cautiously to be gone about by the old and weak.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XL" UNIT="§."/> The <HI>Nervous</HI> or Flying <HI>Gout</HI> (both which I take to be the same, and to differ from the Windy <HI>Gout,</HI> which is nothing but a <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> or <HI>Hysterical</HI> Symptom) is owing to the Weakness, Softness, or Re∣laxation of the <HI>Nerves</HI> of those Persons who labour under it. All the Solids of the Body are made up of small Threads or Filaments of different Natures and Textures. They are divided into the <HI>Fleshy,</HI> the <HI>Nervous,</HI> the <HI>Membranous,</HI> and the <HI>Bony;</HI> and make up the solid Substance of the whole Animal Body: But all of them agree in a greater or lesser Degree of Springiness or Elasticity. And it is observable, that some of the most perfect springy Bodies, are made of ani∣mal and vegetable Substances; such as Ivo∣ry, Ebony and Whalebone. Wherein the general Nature of Elasticity consists, or what is the particular Cause of the eminent Springiness of animal <HI>Fibres,</HI> is as hard to explain as conceive; which notwithstand∣ing, is the noblest Instrument of all the Actions and Functions of an animated Bo∣dy. All the Attempts hitherto made to
<PB N="66" REF="78"/>discover the particular Nature of a <HI>Con∣tractile</HI> and <HI>Distractile</HI> Animal <HI>Fibre,</HI> to me seem insufficient and conjectural. <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI> has discover'd, by his Glasses, that the smallest <HI>Fibre</HI> of an <HI>Elephant</HI> is not big∣ger than that of the smallest <HI>Insect:</HI> And if the modern System of Generation be just, to wit, That an Animal or Plant comes from another lesser one; then Growth is nothing, but the unfolding the original <HI>Membranes</HI> and <HI>Fibres:</HI> And the length of every <HI>Fibre</HI> is the same in the youngest, as in the full grown Animal or Plant. So Growth and Motion both, that is, the whole Business of the Animal Life, is owing to the Springiness of these <HI>Fibres.</HI> The best Resemblance I can make of them, is that of a long Hair, or small twisted Gut, which, when stretch'd to any length beyond its na∣tural State, will restore it self again to its former Dimensions. And in this Contrac∣tion and Restitution of an Animal <HI>Fibre;</HI> the greatest Mysteries of the whole Struc∣ture consist. As there are some People who have hard, gross, stiff Hair, with a strong Spring; so there are others, who have soft, fine, weak Hair, with a feeble Spring: And generally speaking, as the Hair is, so the
<PB N="67" REF="79"/>Threads, Filaments and <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Body are. Those whose <HI>Fibres</HI> are soft, fine, weak and of a feeble Spring, are generally said to be of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> and liable to <HI>Ner∣vous</HI> Distempers. And here we may observe the Difference between more tense and stif∣fer <HI>Fibres,</HI> and more springy and elastick ones. All the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Body are in a State of <HI>Distension,</HI> as is evident from the gaping Lips of Wounds. Two Persons may have <HI>Fibres</HI> of the same Degree of Springiness and Elasticity; and yet in their natural State, and original Formation, the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the one may be more stretch'd, bent and distracted, and consequently more stiff and tense than those of the other; whereby the more stiff or tense <HI>Fibres</HI> mak∣ing a greater Resistance, and being with more Difficulty stretch'd and widen'd, will give more Pain, when a gross Fluid passes thro' them, than less stiff or tense <HI>Fibres</HI> will. Which gives an Account why of two Per∣sons, both of them of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> the one shou'd have the <HI>Gout,</HI> the other be free from it. Persons of weak <HI>Nerves</HI> must necessa∣rily have less Strength, a weaker Pulse and Digestion; a slower and more imperfect Circulation of the Fluids, and a less free
<PB N="68" REF="80"/>and perfect Perspiration; and if they hap∣pen to indulge in strong Meats and generous Wines, they must become subject to <HI>Hyste∣rick, Hypochondriac</HI> and <HI>Cephalic</HI> Disorders. But if, together with weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> a grea∣ter Degree of Tensity or Stiffness be join'd, under the same Circumstances, they will be liable to <HI>Gouty,</HI> together with the foremen∣tion'd Disorders. But by reason of the Na∣tural Weakness and less Original Springiness of their <HI>Nervous Fibres,</HI> the Fits of these <HI>Gouts</HI> will be less painful and more constant.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XLI" UNIT="§."/> <HI>Coroll.</HI> From this Account of the <HI>Nervous Gout</HI> and other <HI>Nervous</HI> Distem∣pers, 'tis plain, all Evacuations (except the most gentle) must be prejudicial in them. Gentle Vomits, as they cleanse the Sto∣mach and Bowels, and principally as they free the <HI>Nerves</HI> from all extraneous Bodies, and increase the Perspiration, by the vio∣lent Convulsions and Contractions of the internal Muscles and Membranes; Blisters, as they open the Obstructions of the small Vessels, by their external, and thin the si∣zy Juices by their internal Efficacy; I say, both these Evacuations, may not only safe∣ly, but with great Advantage, be us'd in <HI>Nervous</HI> Cases. But all violent Purges and
<PB N="69" REF="81"/>excessive Bleedings, are religiously to be ab∣stain'd from, as encreasing the original Weakness. Purges in People of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> in Chronical Cases, carry off a great part of the Nourishment of almost three Days. Vomits, on the contrary, carry off only those Crudities, that send up to the Head and <HI>Nervous</HI> System, the noxi∣ous Fumes and Vapours that cause their Mi∣sery. Purges relax and weaken the <HI>Fibres</HI> of a natural and necessary Function, to wit, those of Digestion: Whereas Vomits can but weaken the Action of <HI>Muscular Fibres,</HI> less us'd, strong in themselves, and not so necessary to Concoction; as is evi∣dent from <HI>Monsieur Chirac</HI>'s Experiment a∣bout Vomiting. Purges carry off little, but what wou'd otherwise pass off, in Time, by the natural Course of the <HI>Peristaltic</HI> Mo∣tion; and generally leave behind them what wants the inverted Motion, as they found it. Whereas Vomits pump up those Crudities, that Nature it self would (gladly, so to speak) throw up, by the same Organs, the same way Nature tends. <HI>Lastly,</HI> four and acid Humours, lodg'd in the Stomach and Guts, must necessarily weaken both, more than either gentle Vomits, or Purges
<PB N="70" REF="82"/>possibly can; with this Difference, tho' that a very gentle, natural, or artificial Purging, continu'd for any long Time, in Persons of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> shall both weaken the Person, and waste the <HI>Muscular</HI> Flesh. Whereas you shall find, after several Months daily Vomiting, in a Sea-Voyage, a Day or two's Refreshment ashoar, restores the Per∣son to a greater Degree of Alacrity and Strength than before: Whence it comes to pass, that Persons of weak <HI>Nerves</HI> are so much reliev'd and rais'd by Vomits; and, on the contrary, so much sunk and depress'd by rough and strong Purges in Chronical Cases. What farther is to be expected in such Cases, is to be done by a regular and strict Diet, fitted to the mere Necessities of Nature. Strengthners of the Digestive Faculties, (and here the <HI>Bark</HI> and <HI>Steel</HI> claim the first place, as being the most certain Strengthners of weak <HI>Nerves</HI>) gentle and constant Exercise, as encouraging the Per∣spiration: <HI>Aromatick</HI> and Spicy Bitters, Vo∣latile and attenuating Medicines, and what∣ever may be thought fit to nourish, com∣fort and support the Animal Functions.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XLII" UNIT="§."/> Having had frequent occasion to mention the <HI>Bark,</HI> as being absolutely ne∣cessary
<PB N="71" REF="83"/>to the Subject I treat; it may not be amiss to remove one Objection against it; and the only one I have ever heard or read made with any Shew of Reason. I have ta∣ken as much of it my self, and as often, and have prescrib'd it as freely as any of my Age; I believe; and never observ'd it, either in my self or others, do any Hurt, except when it has been injudiciously and improperly prescrib'd, and that in continu'd acute Cases only. The Objection is, that it often leaves behind it a bad Habit, a <HI>Scorbutic, Cachectic,</HI> or <HI>Hectic</HI> Constitution; bad <HI>Lungs, Liver,</HI> or <HI>Stomach;</HI> or some of the great <HI>Viscera</HI> spoil'd or corrupted. But the Mistake in this Objection lies here, to wit, that few Constitutions break, and seldom any of these great Organs become vitiated; but they begin with an intermittent or periodi∣cal <HI>Fever.</HI> And these I have constantly ob∣served to be of that kind, and approaching that Season, which <HI>Sydenham</HI> most judici∣ously distinguishes from <HI>Vernal</HI> ones, and calls <HI>Autumnal Agues;</HI> and are indeed symp∣tomatical only, arising from beginning Obstructions in the whole Habit, or in these greater <HI>Viscera:</HI> where all Nature is at work, and the whole Organs labour and
<PB N="72" REF="84"/>struggle to thin the sizy Fluids, and to open the obstructed Bowels; but not being able to bring about this End, Nature succumbs after every Feverish Fit, thus excited, into a worse State. And even here too, the <HI>Bark</HI> does all its proper Office, in quench∣ing, to wit, the violent <HI>Paroxysms</HI> of the <HI>Fever,</HI> which only can endanger the Life of the Patient: and allows time for other Me∣dicines to act. But when the Habit is alrea∣dy broken, and the great <HI>Viscera</HI> already unsound; it cannot be blamed that it do's not restore these; nothing like that being ex∣pected from it, or ascribed to it. When the <HI>Bark</HI> has extinguished the Feverish Fits, which threaten Death to the Patient, a Re∣prieve is obtain'd: in which, by deobstru∣ent and attenuating Medicines, Health and Life may be secured. In relax'd <HI>Nerves</HI> of the <HI>Primaeviae;</HI> in almost all sorts of <HI>Ner∣vous</HI> and <HI>Cephalic</HI> Diseases depending on these; in all <HI>Gouty</HI> Disorders in the <HI>Alimen∣tary</HI> Passages; in all <HI>Nervous Gouts;</HI> in all Intermittent and <HI>Periodical</HI> Distempers, or Pains whatsoever: 'tis preferable to any thing hitherto us'd; only in very cold Sto∣machs and Constitutions, I have found a Decoction of the <HI>Indian Bark,</HI> by some
<PB N="73" REF="85"/>call'd <HI>Elatherium</HI> to be yet more effectual and strengthning; as it will also more readi∣ly remove the periodical Disorders of such. But the <HI>Peruvian Bark</HI> I never found did any Hurt, but in acute continu'd Cases; where it runs into violent Purgings: And in the <HI>Monthly Purgations</HI> of the Sex, which sometimes it will obstruct; and therefore it ought not to be given without <HI>Steel;</HI> which ought also to be added, when it is given in Chronical Cases. It were to be wish'd only, in these Cases it gave the same Relief the se∣cond and succeeding times it does the first.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XLIII" UNIT="§."/> I have formerly observ'd, that when, the Gout becomes dispers'd over the whole Habit, or fix'd and settl'd on a parti∣cular Joynt, <HI>Mercurial</HI> Vomits and Purges were absolutely necessary to dislodge it. But there is one Species of the <HI>Gout</HI> which miserably torments its Subjects, and yet yields not to that, or very rarely to any of the Methods in use; I mean the <HI>Gout</HI> on the Hip-Joint, when fix'd and constant, com∣monly call'd the <HI>Sciatica;</HI> and yet treated after the manner I'm to explain, never fails of a perfect Cure. The Foundation of the Method I had from the late <HI>most Learned and Eminent Physician Doctor Archibald Pitcairn;</HI> he having communicated it to
<PB N="74" REF="86"/>me under no Restriction of Secrecy, I think my self oblig'd to publish it to the World, for the Benefit of the afflicted. I have us'd it with great Success these several Years, and I think have improv'd it in several Parti∣culars of the Management; and so never fail of a perfect Cure, if the Distemper is a genuine <HI>Sciatica,</HI> tho' of many Years stand∣ing; and after having baffl'd all other At∣tempts. It consists in taking from one, two, three Drams, to half an Ounce (according to the Strength of the Patient's Stomach) of the Aetherial Oyl of <HI>Turpentine</HI> (that which comes off between the Spirit and Oyl, in drawing off the common Oyl of <HI>Turpen∣tine</HI>) in triple the Quantity of Virgin Ho∣ney in a Morning fasting, for four, five, six, or eight Days at farthest, intermitting a Day now and then, as the Patient's Occasi∣ons require, or his Stomach suffers by it: In drinking, after it is down, large Draughts of Sack Whey, to settle it on the Stomach, and carry it into the Blood: And lastly, in taking a proper Dose of <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Pills eve∣ry Night, that Day the Medicine is swallow∣ed. This Course never fails to remove the Violence of the Pain, and to leave only a Weakness en the Part. To remove the grosser Remains, and strengthen the weak∣en'd
<PB N="75" REF="87" MS="y"/>Part, I order a Dram or two Drams of Flower of Brimstone, for some time, twice a Day, in a Tea cup full of Milk. If through great Intemperance, or a violent Cold, the Patient relapses, I or∣der the Repetition of the former Medicines for a Day or two, which commonly sets it a packing. And lastly, to strengthen the <HI>Primaeviae,</HI> and enliven the Spirits, I advise <HI>Bath</HI> or <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters with <HI>Steel,</HI> and Bitters with <HI>Volatiles;</HI> and perhaps pumping on the Part affected, which never fails to per∣fect the Cure in a genuine <HI>Sciatica.</HI> And I hope it may be of some use, to have a Me∣thod of Cure for this Distemper, so plainly laid down, so effectual in it self, so easy to the Patient, and so restorative of his Con∣stitution in general, in respect of those Tor∣tures and the nauseous Load of Medicines the afflicted are forc'd to go through in common Practice. The great Efficacy of this Course consists in the <HI>Aetherial Oyl:</HI> It has been common to prescribe a few Drops of the Oyl of <HI>Turpentine</HI> in cold <HI>Rheu∣matisms</HI> and fix'd Pains on the Joynts: But this seldom proves effectual in the <HI>Sciatica:</HI> Whereas this <HI>Aetherial Oyl,</HI> having all the Penetration of the Spirit, together with the Softness and Detergency of the finest <HI>Bal∣sam,</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="88"/>but chiefly being of such Lightness, that any Quantity of it may be given, that can stay on the Stomach, or be kept down by frequent Draughts of any soft Liquor, especially Sack-Whey: which by its Milki∣ness uniting readily with the <HI>Aetherial Oyl;</HI> Penetrates into the least and finest Vessels, and the most secret Recesses of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy;</HI> opens their Obstructions; dis∣solves the glutinous Gellies in the Joints; cleanses the insides of the <HI>Tubes,</HI> and makes all pass by Perspiration. The Rule where∣by to accommodate the Dose to the Patient, is to order it so, that it mayn't be so much as to recoil upwards; to prevent which, a large Quantity of Sack-Whey is order'd: And it seldom moves above once downwards; but lest it shou'd go farther, in the subsequent Doses, the Pills take place.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XLIV" UNIT="§."/> As to <HI>Topicks</HI> or outward Appli∣cations, to ease or relieve the Part affected in a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> they are dangerous, un∣less discreetly manag'd. In the frequently mention'd <HI>Cardinal</HI> Fits of <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Autumn,</HI> when, through Ignorance or Ne∣glect of the Methods hitherto laid down, they shall happen <HI>Regular;</HI> I would by no Means encourage any such outward Appli∣cation of what kind soever hitherto disco∣ver'd,

In the <HI>Regular Gouts</HI> at those Seasons, these Fits are not to be tamper'd with in any Manner, but in the way formerly directed. For the Habit being loaded with the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour and Salts, must be allow'd a Time to discharge it self, and drive them out of the Body; otherwise Life must be endanger'd by a <HI>putrid</HI> or <HI>malignant Fever:</HI> And these being the Seasons when the Humours natu∣rally undergo some Alterations; if the <HI>Gout</HI> be thrown upon the extreme Parts, Nature must not be disturb'd in her Operations: But whatever is to be done, is to be directed to encourage and fortify her in her own way; and to assist her to expel the last Breathings of this Humour upon the Parts most remote from the Head and Heart, the two Sources of the Motion of all the Fluids: (which has been the Intention of all the Methods and Medicines prescrib'd in this Treatise:) For thus the Blood will be purify'd; the Spirits reliev'd from their Oppression; the Joints render'd pliable, and all the natural Functi∣ons set at liberty. When these Fits are over, any thing that is just and probable, and at∣tended with no Danger, for lessening the future Fits, and lengthening their Intervals, may be try'd. But in the Fits falling out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="78" REF="90"/>these Seasons; in the tedious and lingering Fits of those broken with Age, and Habi∣tual <HI>Gouts;</HI> a well chosen outward Applica∣tion may be safely and successfully us'd; es∣pecially, if at the same Time gentle Stoma∣chic Purges be administred; or a Blister on the Ancles or Wrists be open'd, to let out what may be repell'd by the <HI>Topick;</HI> and thereby to secure the noble Organs. For let Pretenders brag what they will, I know of no outward Application, hitherto disco∣ver'd, but what by its Sluggishness stops the natural Perspiration: Or by its Activity counter-acts the Direction of the Circula∣tion; and consequently repels the Humour in some degree or other. But by thus open∣ing a Way for the Humours to pass else∣where, the Part affected may be much re∣liev'd by proper Applications. <HI>Fuller</HI> and <HI>Bates</HI> give the Forms of some; and Doctor <HI>Pitcairn</HI> was exceeding fond of, and held as a great Secret, that which himself has pub∣lish'd in the last Edition of his Treatises, which is made of two Ounces of white <HI>Arse∣nick,</HI> and six Ounces of <HI>Live-Lime Stone,</HI> put into four Quarts of boiling Water, set in a warm place twenty four Hours: Stoups of this apply'd warm to the Part, he had found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ectual and safe. That which I wou'd ra∣ther
<PB N="79" REF="91" MS="y"/>recommend is, Stoups of a Decoction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Butterbur, Ground-Pine</HI> or <HI>Camomel</HI> Flow∣ers, or any <HI>Aromatic</HI> bitter Plant in Milk; or a <HI>Pultis</HI> of the Head of a Sack-Whey Pos∣set, or any such soft and active Application, to moisten, soften, relax and open at first; and towards the Decline of the Fit a <HI>Mithri∣date</HI> or <HI>Venice Treacle</HI> Plaister; the <HI>Empla∣strum Stomachicum Magistrale,</HI> or the like, to strengthen, warm and comfort; espe∣cially if with these last a stomachic warm Purge be join'd. As to <HI>Symptomatic Gouts,</HI> there can be no place for them, in the Doc∣trine hitherto laid down. For on the Sup∣position, that the <HI>Gout</HI> is owing to a particu∣lar Texture and Conformation of Parts; where that Texture and Conformation of Parts is, and the Materials for forming the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is supply'd, there the <HI>Gout</HI> must necessarily be, without the Concur∣rence of any other Distemper: And where these are not, there it cannot be, let the Person be subjected to what other Distemper soever. And if a Person be subjected to two Distempers, in the Cure of the one, due re∣gard is to be had to the Cure of the other. What has been said is all I intend at present on this Subject.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="XLV" UNIT="§."/> For a concluding Observation, we shall take notice, as it is only the <HI>Rich,</HI> the <HI>Lazy,</HI> the <HI>Voluptuous;</HI> who suffer most by the <HI>Gout:</HI> (I mean <HI>Acquir'd Gouts,</HI> and those he∣reditary ones enrag'd by <HI>Luxury</HI>) so those only, who have spent their Life-time under its Tortures best can tell, what astonishing Miseries <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> bring upon Hu∣man Kind! When the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour has seiz'd upon all the <HI>Noble Principles</HI> of Life, when it has broken, subdu'd and obstructed all the <HI>fine Pipes,</HI> and slender Passages, in whose Openness and Soundness all the <HI>Ex∣quisite Sensations,</HI> all the <HI>Delicate Usages</HI> of the <HI>Animal Faculties</HI> consist. When nothing but Pain, and Melancholy, frightful Ideas, horrible Dreams and black Despair remain; who wou'd not have parted with the <HI>Richest Delicacies,</HI> the most <HI>Delicious Wines,</HI> and the most <HI>Enticing Vices,</HI> for a plain, simple Diet, an useful laborious Life, Freedom from Pain, and a good <HI>Conscience?</HI> TEMPERANCE only, Divine, Innocent, Indolent and Joy∣ous <HI>Temperance</HI> can Cure or effectually Re∣lieve the <HI>Gout.</HI> For let Us, or our Brethren the <HI>Quacks,</HI> brag what we will,</P>
