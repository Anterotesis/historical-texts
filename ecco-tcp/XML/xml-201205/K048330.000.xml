<P>A Dissertation upon the Nervous System to show its Influence u∣pon the Soul.</P>
<P>Man can know little, and yet he wants to know all things, He is con∣fined to a point of time in this life, yet extends his Views backwards &amp; forwards, through Millions of Ages, till he is lost in eternity. He is confined to some minute part of this Globe; yet while his feet stand on it, his Soul is travelling through the whole planetary System, traversing the immensity of Space, till he is at last lost in Infinity.</P>

<HEAD>DISSERTATION ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed, it will be necessary to explain, in a simple manner, the Na∣ture of those bodily powers, which Constitute the very Principles of Life.</P>
<P>The Human Body is sustained and kept a∣live, by three principal powers, which like the movements of a Clock or Watch, co-operate and assist each other: The first is the brain and Nervous System proceeding from it, the grand Source of all Sensation; The Second, is the Heart and Arteries, or blood Vessels, which give motion and circulation to the Blood; And the Third is the Stomach and Bowels, which prepare the Aliment and sup∣ply Nourishment for those, as well as all parts of the Body.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<P>In speaking of Digestion it will be remark∣ed, that the Stomach loses its power when de∣prived of Nervous Influence; and we should here take notice, that the Regularity and Vi∣gour of the Heart's motion, chiefly depend on the same cause.</P>
<P>As therefore the Brain and Nerves, the Heart and Arteries, and the Stomach and Bowels, are the principal instruments of all Sensation, Circulation, Nutrition, Life and Motion, and the very Agents which govern and direct the whole Animal Machine; It will be necessarily consequent, that when any of them becomes disconcerted, and put out of order, the vital functions of the Body depen∣ding upon them, must then be unduly per∣formed. <Q>"where one Link's broken, the whole chain's destroyed."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the extraordinary Sympathy and in∣tercourse between those several organs, that like so many little provinces, allied by mutual Interest, not one of them can exercise its full power without the assistance and concurrence of the rest; for as the Heart and Stomach cannot act without the assistance of the Brain, or the Stomach Digest without receiving a due Quantity of blood from the Heart; so neither can the Heart have sufficient force to keep up the circulation, without a continual supply of nourishment from the Stomach;
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>or even the Brain itself exert its Influence over those organs without being duly nou∣rished by Both. Although it will evidently appear, that the Nerves are the Immediate or∣gans of all vital motion and Sensation, and the medium by which impressions made on the Body are instantly conveyed to the mind; yet the precise manner by which this misteri∣ous intercourse is carried on, remains a sec∣ret in nature with which, perhaps, we shall never be acquainted</P>
<P>So intimately connected are the Body and Soul, and such their Correspondence, that Impressions made on the one naturally influ∣ence the other with the like feelings: Thus, by immoderate grief the digestive faculty of the Stomach is impaired and taken away, and by a blow on the head which injures the Brain, the Soul is as it were dethroned, and losing its empire over the Body, all sense and motion are instantly destroyed. The Soul, or Intellect, whilst confined to the Body, "That muddy Vesture of decay," is obliged to stoop to the state and condition of the Nerves, whose feelings are liable to alteration from a thousand accidental or unavoidable causes, so as to occasion diseases, or being to∣tally abolished, to produce instant death. Those, as well as many other circumstances, concur to prove that the faculties and dispo∣sition
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>of the mind, in a great measure, depend on the bodily organs with which they co-ope∣rate, and where those are changed from their natural State, so are its appetites and oper∣ations.</P>
<P>How different is the State of the Body and Soul when the vessels are empty or full, viz. after long fasting, or a plentiful meal, in the first the pulse is weak and unequal, the Com∣plexion pale, the Body languid, and the Spi∣rits desponding: But after eating and the mo∣derate use of wine, the Springs of Life are wound up, and the Body and Soul are restor∣ed to their native vigour.</P>
<P>The consent between the Brain and Heart is remarkable, for, intense Study or thinking quickens the Pulse, and a sudden fright will occasion palpetations or a convulsive Struggle of the heart, even sometimes to a mortal suf∣focation: in both these cases, the first impres∣sion is made on the Brain, and the Heart, like a faithfull companion, suffers by sympa∣thy; but whether the Nerves act as Tubes, or Vibrating Cords, like the Strings of a mu∣sical Instrument, or whether they serve as conductors to some subtle fluid similar to that of Electric Fire, we are wholly ignorant The Brain seems therefore to the Nerves, what the Heart is to the Blood Vessels or Arteries; for too violent a degree of Action in the last,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>will produce heat and increase circulation, as may be observed after violent exercise, or in the time of a Fever: in like manner, when the power of the Brain and Nerves is too vio∣lently impressed on the Body or Soul, their Sensations will be rendered too quick and exquisite; like the motion of a watch, which becomes rapid and irregular when the main spring acts too strongly on the several wheels and subordinate movements.</P>
<P>Impressions made on the Soul will often totally subdue those of the Body: and on the contrary, such as are made on the Body, will remove those of the Soul; all which may supply an Intelligent observer with use∣ful hints in the cure of such diseases as have been unsuccessfully treated by medicines.</P>
<P>Religious doubts which perplex the Soul with alternate Hopes and fears, a Sedentary life, or warm, damp air, all dispose the con∣stitution to Melancholy, by weakning the Nervous power. Those are the general causes of low Spirits, and acquired melancholy, which always operate most powerfully on People of nice Sensations, whose Pleasures and Pains from over-delicacy of the Nervous System, are too exquisite for sense; but the precise manner in which they produce their effects, or why such causes do not always oc∣casion similar consequences, in such a parti∣cular State of the Nerves, is utterly unknown.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<Q><L>"Where Joy most revels, Grief doth most lament;</L>
<L>Grief Joys. Joy grieves, on slender accident."</L></Q>
<P>Those, on the contrary, of more clumsy or∣gans, who are possessed of little more than Vegetable-feeling, never experience the mise∣ry of Nervous Disorders; but if they have less pleasure, the account is balanced by their enduring less pain.</P>
<P>We have already observed, that the Body and Soul, receive all their information by means of the Brain and Nerves, and that by Those they mutually converse and sympathize with each other; hence it will follow, that whenever those Organs are Injured, and like unfaithful Messengers, do not truly execute their Office, and represent things as they are, the Patient will then be imposed upon, by Delusive Perception, and figure to herself things which have no existence, but in her own distempered Brain.</P>
<P>They suppose that every one looks upon them with a malignant eye, and puts the worst construction on what they say and do; In short, though they are industrious to torment themselves, by means which appear ludicrous, they experience substantial misery, and are sometimes driven to desperation, and Suicide; so that in the whole catalogue of earthly evils, human Nature cannot present an object more truly pitiable!</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<P>What then shall be said of those who either from Ambition or the view of gain, stifle the feelings of honour and humanity, and sordid∣ly submit to form alliances which Entail he∣reditary miseries on their posterity, more grie∣vous than death itself! and who, therefore, instead of remembering the Authors of their being with filial affection, must behold them with indignation and sorrow!</P>
<P>Retirement and bodily ease are not de∣structive to the melancholy, for whilst they sit still unemployed, they become a prey to their own thoughts. On the contrary, exer∣cise and severity of Diet, are beneficial; for no one can think or study with the same at∣tention, when impressed with the disagreeable sensation of Hunger, or tormented with a ra∣ging tooth, as when he is perfectly at ease.</P>
<P>Since we find that painful sensations ap∣plied to the Body or Mind, often destroy health and occasion Melancholy; by parity of reasoning it may be concluded, that pleasur∣able feelings of a contrary nature will bid fairest to restore it: The chiefest of those are, Chearful Company, Poetry, Music, and Dramatic entertainments of the Comic kind, Frequent exercise in the open Fields, or flower Gardens, the waters of Tunbridge or Spa, assisted by that sovereign remedy the
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>Peruvian Bark, and the use of the cold Bath, will also be found powerfully Salutary.</P>
<P>The Study of Natural History, and em∣ployment of delineating some of its most beau∣tiful and minute objects arranged under their proper classes, as those of Birds, Insects and Flowers, will afford very pleasing and rational entertainment and assist in diverting the mind from things of a more serious nature. Parti∣cular thoughts and reflections of the mind are joined with certain conditions of the Bo∣dy; and therefore, our manner of living, in a considerable Degree, changes our manner of thinking. Hence by Pravelling, the univer∣sal benefits of Air, Exercise and Diet, will at once be most agreeably obtain'd; all which tend to strengthen the Constitution, and to wear out disagreeable impressions made on the Body or mind by introducing others of a dif∣ferent nature.</P>
<P>The next Sovereign remedy in diseases of the mind is Music. Cicero asserts it's amaz∣ing power, and Plato Supposes the effect of harmony on the mind is equal to that of air on the Body: Its Divine influence is exempli∣fied by David in the Cure of Saul; and the Eastern Monarch who had conquered the world, was himself Subdued by the Seraphic Strains of Timotheus's Harp, which so capti∣vated his ear, that he was roused into mad∣ness,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>or soothed into melancholy as the sounds became sprightly and animated, or Solemn and Slow.</P>
<P>So wonderful is the empire of Music over the mind, as recorded by the antients, that it leads the soldier undaunted to the <Q>"Immi∣nent deadly breach."</Q> and alternately stops the rage of conquest by its varied power: It mitigates bodily pain, suspends the malignant force of madness and despair, and lulls the Soul into traquility and peace.</P>
<P>The effect of music however will be differ∣ent according to the stile, and manner of its composition, and therefore should be adapted to the particular state and disposition of the mind. The plaintive Tone of soft Flutes will induce a pleasing languor, and compose it when tortured with rage or irritated by the more violent passions; and on the Contrary, the merry pipe and Tabor will exhilerate, and raise the moping head of melancholy, depres∣sed by Religious Despair, Disapointed Ambi∣tion, or hopeless Love.</P>
<P>Let us appeal to the refined feelings of those most susceptible of the Divine power of harmony, to prove its sovereign influence over the mind; that it is the true oblivious Antidote, the Nepenthe of the Gods, to heal a wounded Spirit, to exalt the Soul above low-thoughted care, and lap it in Elysium.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<P>This great sensibility occasions people of Rank to be Victims of their most favourite feelings; all that afflicts or threatens others, all the evil incident to mankind in general, are to them real grievances, affecting them, very frequently, more than their own private complaints, and essentially destroy their health; in a word, infinitely more sensible of tender impressions, and exposed to a much greater number than the Peasant, of necessity they must suffer much more.</P>
<P>Nerves continually agitated by humours which are always irritative, by disordering the harmony of the Organs, and enfeebling the Body, murder the mental faculties; which are so much dependant on the Situation of its surrounding body, that whatever disorders The oeconomy of the one, absolutely preju∣dices the mode of thinking in the other.</P>
<Q><L>"That bright'ning ray, by God himself bestow'd,</L>
<L>Blends with our Senses, and like them grows weak."</L></Q>
<P>Nervous disorders, that disposition to be too easily affected and susceptible of irregular and painful emotions, is one of the most cruel scourges to people of rank that has been ad∣vanced. It most commonly occurs, and till now, has been particularly unhappy in a mis∣taken treatment, because its origin had not
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>been sufficiently investigated: it's different Species, which required very different reme∣dies, was left unexamined. This Branch of Physic is at present too much confined to hypothesis, the Subject of party disputes, or at least influenced by Fashion.</P>
<P>Many Eminent Physicians, regarding all disorders of the Nerves as the Consequences of relaxed fibres, and weak digestions, would effect a cure by means of remedies which are hot, and strengthening, by Gums, Steel, Bit∣ters, Camphire, Castor, Musk, Spirituous Tinctures, Opium, &amp;c. which is an error si∣milar to the following, in speaking of indi∣gestion and Stomachic remedies. In attri∣buting all Nervous complaints to one cause, they have proposed but one kind of remedy, which unhappily has no better success than in complaints of the Stomach. Nerves inflamed by the immoderate use of Aromatics, are not relieved by using Assafoetida; a sharper Me∣dicine than the most piquant Aromatic: those who are dried up by the abuse of Barbadoes Water and Marasquin, will not find assistance by drinking great quantities of the Tincture of Gentian, of Valerian, or of Castor; but those remedies so hurtful, in these cases, are very beneficial in cases where a weak fibre, or poor and watery Blood are the true causes of the complaint, and such cases often do occur.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<P>That Tea affects the Nerves of the Stomach is evident, by its communicating disagreeable Sensations upon the Soul. That the Soul becomes affected when the digestion of the Stomach is impaired, is also evident, so that the Soul cannot be answerable in that case, for Actions of the Body; for without the Nerves are braced up to the Standard of the Soul, it's ideas are imperfectly connected: so that it is clear, the Nerves operate upon the Soul, as the Works of a Clock regulate the Movement in keeping Time.</P>
<P>That extreme sensibility to all Impressions, which render many so unhappy, should be treated like disorders of the Nerves, on which it depends, and often requires cold Baths, Milk diet, much exercise, and the courage to brave the open Air, and those things which we most dread.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Disorder only exists in the Imagination. The vapourish persuade them∣selves they are not able to do any thing, when they are very strong; they fancy every thing incommodious which they are very well able to bear; they deprive themselves of, and re∣nounce, all enjoyments, frighten themselves with an unexisting Bugbear, and court a real one. Such Cases require the Physicians ut∣most penetration: If he is deluded, the Patient is lost; but if he deceives the Patient, and gains
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>his confidence, a Cure is the work of a mi∣nute. I have seen five such Persons, who fancied they could neither bear light, noise, air, or food, keep their Beds in a dark and matted Chamber, where none were suffer'd to walk, move, or speak out, but with the ut∣most precaution; lived only on Broth and Jellies; thought themselves dangerously ill, settled their Affairs, and all this while they were perfectly well: I compelled them to see, hear, speak quit their Beds, and even their House, to eat and act like other People, to feel themselves well, and pass in one quarter of an Hour from the greatest Misery to the greatest Happiness.</P>
<P>We must be persuaded the Nerves are im∣mediately affected by the Labours of the Soul: inactivity is also sufficient to destroy them, and often produces this effect, even in Persons whose mind is as indolent as their Body The Nerves are the principal parts of the Machine, whenever any of the Animal Functions are disturbed, they must undoubtedly be injured.</P>
<P>When the Nerves are affected without any sensible cause, one would be led to suppose, that some disease would soon appear, the source of which might possibly be discovered by attentive observation and be the more easi∣ly destroyed before the disease had come to any height. Some disorders, (of the Stomach
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>especially) shew themselves more readily by the effects they have on the Nerves; for they being a kind of Medium between the Soul and the Body, are exposed to suffer from the irregularities of each, and communicate to the one, the injuries they receive from the other: thus it is that the Soul becomes prejudicial to the Body, and the Body hurtful to the Soul, and that they are both combined in destroy∣ing the Nervous System.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now consider what is to be done to obtain a cure in Nervous Diseases.</P>
<P>First then, we are exactly to regulate the use of non-naturals; For in vain is a pre∣scription of medicines, if the Patient is not directed and willing to observe certain regu∣lations, in relation to Air, diet▪ and Exercise. Chuse a free open Air, not incumber'd with Hills or Woods A dry cool Air, braces and Invigorates the whole Body; while a Hot, confined, and damp Air, weakens and relaxes the Habit. When the Stomach and Bowels are weak▪ they should be well guarded against cold and Damps especially in Winter; and there is no dress better and more necessary to
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>keep up a due perspiration, than Flannels worn next the Skin.</P>
<P>Constant exercise, every day that allows of it, either in walking, on horse-back, or in an open Chaise, is of vast service; it should be as much as the strength will admit, without weakness, fatigue or hurry; never weary yourself, nor raise a Sweat, go no further, than you can return with as much spirit as you went out. Exercise strengthens the whole Nervous System, assists digestion, (but retards it after a full meal; therefore after dinner sit a while) Sangnification, and the distribution and secretion of all the Animal Fluids. By muscular motion, the blood and Juices are kept in a due state of Fluidity; their Viscidi∣dity is broken and dissolved, and all obstruc∣tions either prevented or removed. The flesh Brush is an excellent thing for strengthening the Solids; as friction, either with the flesh brush, flannel or coarse Linnen Cloth, strengthens the Body, promotes the circula∣tion, and is particularly useful in weak Bow∣els.</P>
<P>People of weak Nerves are generally quick thinkers, from the delicacy of their sensitive organs, which we therefore more liable to be fatigued and relaxed with exercise, than those of a Coarser make; whence we see the ne∣cessity of keeping the mind easy, quiet and
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>chearful, since nothing hurts Nervous People more, than fear, grief, and anxiety. Use therefore agreeable amusements, and a little slight, entertaining and diverting reading, that requires no thought, for all Study is pernicious and hurtful. Conversation should be agreeable trifling and easy, without dispute or contradiction; amusements be Innocent, various, and not expensive: otherways, upon reflection, the money laid out would do more hurt, than the amusements could recompence. In a word, all thought and care must be laid aside; and rationality must give place for a while, to a way of life, which Bath gives a pattern of. I cannot but highly approve of a practice there, of having music, while the Patients drink the Water; which has a very great and good effect upon the motion of the finer animal Fibres. Music has been allow'd, in all ages of the world, to have a Noble pow∣er in raising the dejected ideas of the Soul. Those that have the most delicate constituti∣ons, are most sensible of its good effects; it opens the obstructions of the finest Vessels; assuages the passions, and at the same time communicates a pleasure to the Soul, and makes its ideas chearful, gay and lively; by the oscillatory motion of the Air, vibrating a∣gainst the tempanum of the ear, there is such an impulsive motion given to the finest fibres
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>of the Brain, (upon which the Soul more immediately displays its Faculties) as to enable them to bring regular impulses to the senso∣rium.</P>
<P>But music, though it restores the Tone of the finest Fibres of the Brain; yet the inferi∣or organs demand coarser treatment, to re∣store them to the Standard of health</P>
<P>We must abridge the Quantity and Quality of our food, which ought to be nourishing, easy of Digestion, and suited to the Stomach of the Patient. Fat meats, and heavy sauces are hurtful; and all excess is to be avoided. The Patient ought never to eat more than the Stomach can easily digest: eat therefore little at a time, but often, of innocent, plain and simple meat; for every time the stomach is overloaded, the strength is impaired, and its Nerves are disordered.</P>
<P>Above all things, heavy suppers ought to be avoided; since the stomach is much more apt to be oppressed with the same quantity of food, in an horizontal position, than in any erect posture; and since the Digeston goes on Slower in time of sleep than when awake, as the vessels are then much relaxed.</P>
<P>It is a great blessing, that loathing, and want of appetite in some degree, attend all disorders, which prevent many people from in fallibly and quickly ruining themselves with∣out
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>resource. Those who have only a few transient symptoms, and are but in the first stage of Nervous Diseases, should live with a due degree of temperance suited to their con∣stitution; and abate a little of the quantity of their food, while they are more immediately under the symptoms. Indeed, if the disorder is deep, and hath continued so long as to pro∣duce more violent symptoms, there is a ne∣cessity to be still more careful. Drink small Beer, soft fine ale, or Wine and water; but never use water alone. Wine in excess en∣feebles the Body, and impairs the faculties of the Soul; but a few glasses of wine, in time of eating, assist digestion. A Glass of wine before Dinner, on an empty Stomach, and when one is Languid, feeble or faint, is of great service. Wine in general, is preferable to Malt Liquor; the best Wine is Rhenish, Mountain, or small French Wine. When the stomach and Bowels are troubled with a∣cidity, water mixed with Rum or Brandy, is preferable to Wine, or Malt Liquor. That too common drink Tea, is very hurtful to both the stomach and Nerves, especially if drank hot, with little Bread: I would there∣fore recommend▪ not the disuse, but the more moderate use of Tea: it were, well, if something else was Joined with it in the morn∣ing; Or instead of Tea, which is almost con∣stantly
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>hurtful to the Neves, a Tea made of Balm and mint, in every dish of which should be put a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea spoonful of the Balsamic mix∣ture of Cream and Yolks of Eggs, with two or three drops of Oil of Cinnamon; which makes an agreeable Beverage, and is highly grateful to the stomach, as I have myself had occasion to observe.</P>
<P>But of all things▪ the cold Bath is the greatest strengthener of the Nerves; it re∣moves glandular obstructions, raises the Spi∣rits, and vivifies and strengthens the whole Man; for Children, delicate constitutions, and Women liable to miscarriages, or trou∣blesome floodings, nothing can be better. Cold Bathing. I am persuaded, is analagous to the Bark, which is also a very proper Me∣dicine, for it strengthens the Stomach, Mus∣cles, Nerves, and even the Soul itself, and enables them to support fresh fatigues. I have known several young Persons throw themselves into the Cold Bath, after being wearied and depressed with Study, who al∣ways found upon coming out▪ a peculiar strength of mind, and a fresh disposition to Study. But I shall here observe, that where the Stomach, Liver, or other Viscera are un∣sound, the Cold Bath is improper.</P>
<P>That eminent Physician Mr Lewis, says, <Q>"That of all Remedies▪ whether external or
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>internal, there is none can equal the virtue of the Cold Bath:—it cools the Body more, strengthens the Nerves better, and promotes perspiration more effectually than any me∣dicine taken down the throat can do."</Q></P>
<P>The use of Bark and the Cold Bath toge∣ther is pointed out by the Nature of their Virtues; they produce the same Effects; and being combined will cure disorders, which every other Remedy would only have en∣creased. Being strengthening, sedative, and febrifugal, they reinvigorate, diminish the fe∣verous and Nervous heat, and calm the irre∣gular motions produced by the Spasmodic disposition of the Nervous System; they for∣tify a weak Stomach, and quickly dissipate its attendant pains. They restore Appetite, they facilitate digestion and nutrition: they promote all the functions, and particularly perspiration, which render them so efficaci∣ous in all cata<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rhous and cutaneous disor∣ders, in a word, they remove all disorders occasioned by weakness provided the Patient is not afflicted with indissoluble obstructions, inflammations, or internal Ulcerous obscesses, which conditions almost necessarily exclude the Cold Bath, but which frequently al∣low of the Quinquina From my own experience, I can assure the Reader, that I have my self plunged into the Cold Bath,
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>when I have found my Spirits so depressed, that without the utmost exertion of a power∣ful Resolution, and being as it were superna∣turaly assisted. I could never have attempt∣ed it. Yet on coming out I have found my Nerves so Braced, and my spirits so strength∣ened, that in a manner I viewed an other and a Spiritual State, with such extacy as made me ready and desirous to enter into it. I shall here too further recite what I once met with at Margate in Kent, where the late King of Britain arrived from Germany, and used the Cold Bath, and drank the Waters with great Advantage which is expressed, by an inscription on a statue erected on purpose, in this manner.</P>
<Q>"Thy Baths give Vigour, and thy Waters Health."</Q>
<P>For altho' the Water only acts immediately on the Cutaneous Nerves and Vessels, yet it's strengthening power is, by sympathy, com∣municated to the inmost parts of the Body, and mixes radically with the Fluids.</P>
<P>Daily experience convinces us of the power of the Soul upon the Stomach. Those most addicted to reflection, perform their Digesti∣on with greater difficulty; on the contrary, those who think little, generally digest well. We frequently see Persons of weak under∣standings eat and drink very freely, without
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>suffering any inconvenience, although they lead sedentary lives, and have not remarkably strong constitutions. On the contrary, how many sensible Men do we see, whose Digestion is performed with much pain and difficulty, although they are of a good habit of Body, and use some exercise.</P>
<P>The connection of the Soul with the Body is in fact so strong, that it's even difficult to conceive how one of them should act, and the other not be sensible, in a greater or a less degree, of that action. The Organs of Sense being put in motion, convey the Subject of thought to the Mind, by acting on the Fibres of the Brain; and while the Soul is employ∣ed in thinking, the parts of the Brain are in a greater or less forcible motion, and in a less or greater degree of tension. These Motions fatigue the medullary or Nervous portion of the Brain; and this delicate substance, after a long course of Meditation, becomes as much exhausted, as a strong Man is after exercise. Whoever has thought intensely, even once in his Life, must have experienced this in him∣self: and there is certainly no very Studious Man, who has not often felt, on coming out of his Closet, violent pains in his head, at∣tended with a great degree of heat in this part. This heat will depend on the proportion of weariness and inflammatory tension, which
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>the medullary substance has undergone: the eyes soon become sensible of this fatigue; and if we consider a Man who is deeply engaged in thought, we shall see that the Muscles of his Face are all upon the stretch, and some∣times appear even convulsed.</P>
<P>A great Author has taken notice of the Danger of fixing the Attention too strongly. <Q>"When the Action of the Soul is too pow∣erful," says he, "it attacks the Body so violently, that it throws it into a consuming State: if the Soul exerts itself in a peculiar manner, on certain occasions, the Body is made sensible of it, and becomes heated and debilitated."</Q></P>
<P>Another Author of note has observed the same, and says; <Q>"The union of the Soul with the Body is so intimate that they, re∣ciprocally share the good or evil which hap∣pen to either of them. The Mind or Soul cannot put forth its powers, when the body is tired with immoderate exercise: and too close an application to study destroys the Body, by dissipating the Animal spirits, which are necessary to recruit it."</Q></P>
<P>The brain, which is the immediate seat of these emotions, the nerves which arise from it, and the Stomach, which is furnished with many nerves of an exquisite sensation▪ are the parts first attacked, and commonly most in∣jured
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>by the immoderate labour of the mind; but if it should continue for any length of time almost all the parts of the body become partakers of the injury.</P>
<P>The first symptoms which indicate a weak∣ness of the Nervous System, are a kind of pusillanimity we were before strangers to; Diffidence, fear, grief, dejection and Dispirit∣edness: he who was the most intrepid man now becomes the most timorous; the slightest undertaking frightens him, the most trifling unforseen incident makes him tremble; the slightest indisposition appears to him a fatal disease; and the idea of Death fills him with intolerable horrors. Some Tyrants have con∣demned certain Philosophers, whom they ha∣ted, to death, but have never been able to make them fear it; how much more effectu∣ally would their cruelty have been exercised if by suffering them still to Live, they could have inspired them with those fears of Death hypochondriacs are tormented with? We see instances every day of men of Learning, who perceiving the first signs of this distemper, have been obliged to forsake their favourite studies; whose Nerves being weakened, they become incapable of attention; their memory fails: their Ideas are confused; a Sensation of heat in the Head, palpitations, a total dejec∣tion,
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>and the apprehension of death makes the pen fall from their hands.</P>
<P>The injury the mind has done the Body soon recoils upon itself; for it has been the will of the supreme Being, that as long as these two Substances continued together, the labours of the mind should in a certain de∣gree depend upon the health of the Body: this truth has been ever acknowledged. An Author has emphatically declared, that <Q>"the props of the Body supported the Soul," And that, "Health increases the powers of the mind; when the body is diseased the mind is not capable of reflection"</Q> It is not therefore surprising that the mind should be weakened, after it has exhausted the Brain and Debilitated the Nerves.</P>
<P>An Eminent Physician who lived long in a City where learning is much cultivated, says, That study begins by impairing the Stomach and that if the complaint is not relieved, it may degenerate into a melancholy. And that a vitiated Stomach attends Learned People, as surely as the shadow follows the Body. That he has seen Patients who suffered for this immoderate thirst of Learning, first by a loss of appetite, an entire inability of the Di∣gesting Powers, and a total debility which ensued; afterwards they have been tormented
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>with spasms, convulsions and at length with a total privation of all their senses.</P>
<P>When the Digestion is imperfect, the hu∣mours imbibe a crude quality, which renders them unfit for their various destinations; and which particularly prevents Nutrition, upon which the reparation of all the Powers de∣pends. To be convinced of the general in∣fluence of the Stomach, it is only necessary to observe the State of a Person who labours under a difficult Digestion; the Powers are lost in a few minutes, a general uneasiness makes the weakness more insupportable, the Organs of Sense are benumbed, the faculties of the Soul are exercised very imperfectly, the Memory, and particularly the Imagination, seems to be annihilated; in a word, nothing makes a sensible Man so much resemble an Idiot, as the difficulty of Digestion. This Observation equally points out to us, that of all Disorders, there are none which more quickly affect the Soul, than those of the Nervous System.</P>
<P>There is one general precaution, which is, to refrain from all Liquors in great quanti∣ties; they weaken Digestion, by relaxing the Stomach, drowning the degestive Juices, and by precipitating the Aliments before they are digested: they relax all the parts, dissolve the humours, excite making Water, or draining
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>Sweats. I have seen disorders occasioned by Weakness considerably diminished without any remedy, but the mere retrenching of the quantity of Liquor the Patient usually Drunk.</P>
<P>We know, that an unnatural State of the Nerves of the Stomach may either produc a craving or an aversion to food; that low Spirits and Melancholy often proceed from that cause: nor is it to be doubted, that when the Nerves of the Stomach are, for cer∣tain causes, affected in a manner somewhat different, an indifference for food, a weak Digestion, a languor and coldness, a slow Pulse, and wasting, may be the consequences. By proper food, the Nerves of the Stomach are gratefully stimulated, and the whole Body is thence enlivened and strengthened; so that, besides its use for nutrition, food in the sto∣mach becomes, altogether necessary in some delicate Nervous People, for keeping up the strength of the Body, and the due exercise of all its suctions. The morbid affection of the Nerves of the Stomach, by sympathy, impairs the Vigour and energy of the whole system.</P>
<P>It is said in Holy Write, <Q>"That where much is given, much will be required"</Q> May I presume then to put a Question, which I wish to do without giving offence to God or the world. How it has happened in all ages,
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>That men of the greatest sensibility of Soul, should be endued with such delicate Nerves, as pervert the mental Faculties and prevent the Soul from exerting its noblest Powers, to shine and illuminate in contemplation of the Works of God?</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Section with Dr Chene's observation, in his English Malady, the reading of which, strikes the Human Mind with asto∣nishment: <Q>"But of all the miseries that af∣flicts human Life, (says that Eminent Phy∣sician) and which principally relate to the Body, in this Valley of Tears, I think Ner∣vous disorders, in their extreme and last Degree, beyond all comparison the worst."</Q> It was the observation of a Great Man, that he had seen persons labouring under the Gout, Stone, Cancer and every other dis∣order, which could tear the Human Ma∣chine. But had he compared them all (and indeed scarce any, willing to lay down cheer∣fully the Load of Clay, we will except tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, who were supported by divine power) but such as laboured under an Internal Anxiety, meaning those most Cruel, Sinking, Suffo∣cating and Strangling, Nervous Disorders, they greatly exceeded. It is almost the only misery to be dreaded and avoided in Life, if possible it can be by any means. For when
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>once the supporters are gone, the Dissolution is perfect.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Human Body is made up of such frail Materials, that they must necessarily de∣cay, and often be put out of order.</P>
<P>We are not only subject to pain, and dis∣eases; but also to Irregularities of the Passions, and Influence of the Weather; all which af∣fect the Spirits, Intellects and Memory, so as to render the same Person very different, at different times, in thinking, speaking, and acting; as any one, who is not robustly in∣sensible must naturally discover from his own feelings, at one time or other. Considering its admirable Structure, the Number and ex∣quisite fineness of its movements, that in a healthy State, all its parts must conspire to perform their proper office, and that the least failure generally occasions some disease; it appears matter of astonishment that we are more than the transitory Beings of a Day.</P>
<P>In this frail and uncertain state, the human System is subject to an Inclement Atmo∣sphere without, and the violent Passions with∣in,
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>it may suffer from Intemperance in Diet, the advances of Age and the prevalence of Injurious Habits, so as to render it more un∣stable than the Weather-Glass, and in a per∣petual state of change, from the Cradle to the Grave.</P>
<P>Well may human Life, thus surrounded by a train of unavoidable dangers, and calamities be compared to a fleeting shadow which ne∣ver contiues in one stay. Like an unballasted bark in a troubled Ocean, it becomes the sport of Winds and tides; and without the aid of Religion, Reason, and Philosophy, is in continual danger of being swallowed up and lost.</P>
<P>Perhaps, however, very few can properly be said to die of old age merely; for even the Life of Old Parr might probably have been still prolonged, had he not changed his Air and manner of Living.</P>
<P>Here we may observe, that by a kind of Fatal Necessity, Animal Bodies are worn out and destroyed by that very cause which con∣stitutes the principles of Life, namely, the circulating power of the Blood; and con∣sequently, that the number of years to which man may attain, will probably be in propor∣tion to the Velocity of the Pulse: If so, it will then follow, that such a particular state of the Constitution as produces the greatest de∣gree
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>of strength and vigour in youth, is not most likely to prolong Life, that those of weak solids, and delicate habits in their early state. grow old more slowly than others; and if the Viscera is sound, become for a time, more strong and Healthy from the effect of Age</P>
<P>The disorders produced by the efforts of the mind fall soonest upon such as are inces∣santly engaged in the contemplation of one object▪ <Q>"Study (says Mr Rousseau) makes men tender, weakens their Constitution, and when once the Body has lost its pow∣ers, those of the soul are not easily preser∣ved. Application wears out the Machine, exhausts the spirits, destroys the strength, enervates the mind, makes us pusillani∣mous, unable either to bear fatigue, or to keep our passions under."</Q></P>
<P>The whole Body becomes hard in process of time, and old age itself is a general indu∣ration. In labouring Men, those parts most used in their respective employmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s grow callous; in men of Letters, the Brain itself is attacked in this manner. They become in∣capable of connecting ideas, and grow old much before their time.</P>
<P>In Children the Brain is too soft in old Persons too hard, and in the two extremes it is equally unfit to communicate the Oscillati∣ons
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>exerted by thinking. Galen has rightly observed, that our memory fails first, and forebodes the weakening of our reason The Nerves are not the only parts affected by deep thinking, for, as Gunzius has observed, the weariness of the eyes is alone sufficient to produce Nervous diseases, There is no one but must have experienced, as I have often done, how much the head is weakened by long attention of the sight. If after a Fever or other Indisposition, it should happen to me, before my strength is well recruited to fix my eyes for a long time on any Object, I am immediately seized with Giddiness, sick∣ness at stomach, and my whole Body suffers a painful Sensation of being fatigued and ex∣hausted</P>
<P>If such are the Injuries brought on the Constitution by irregularity and excess of the Passions, it ought to be the care of every Rational Being, to guard against their insults, and to oppose their Effects with becoming resolution, and a Virtuous Resignation to the Will of Providence.</P>
<P>Happiness and Misery are the Lights and Shades which fill up the out-lines in the Por∣trait of Human Life Every Man naturally endeavours to attain the one, and avoid the other; but by very different means, which are often disproportioned to that end.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
<P>We frequently deceive ourselves, both in the pursuit and enjoyment of our wishes. Extravagance of Hope often ends in disap∣pointment; and even a constant Series of pleasurable Events will at last lose their power. To give them true relish, and make them lasting, the mind must refer to some former painful sensations.</P>
<P>Thus a Person who always possess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Health, is scarce sensible of its value; but when lost, let it again return, and he will bless the means which restored it. None enjoy Riches so much as those who have been at great pains to attain them: He who always was affluent, has no competent idea of Indigence, to con∣trast such a State, or exalt his enjoyment. Were, our exquisite pleasures too lasting, they would lay so much stress on the vital powers of the Body, as would soon wear it out. Every extreme, therefore, corrects itself; and every Evil works its own cure.</P>
<P>If the violent Passions harrow up the Soul, and disturb its union with the Body, a Con∣science pure and uncorrupted, the inestima∣ble reward of Virtue, will best reconcile them to each other, and cause them to dwell in harmony: That will always speak peace to the Mind, whatever the World may say, and shield it from the impotent attacks of slander and abuse. Whoever is over solicitous about
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>Censure, Fame, or the possession of temporal Enjoyments▪ will seldom find repose: an un∣gratious look from his superiors, or unmerit∣ed insolence from those below him, will vex and discompose him. If he is anxious for long life; a Coffin or shroud, the apparatus of Death, will alarm and appal his senses; whilst he who dispenses with unavoidable ills with a Philosphic indifference, who is neither weary of living or affraid to die, will find within himself an inexpressible, and perpetual calm.</P>
<P>By giving way to sorrow, or anger, they at last become habitual and reign triumphant: In a word, the government of the passions is as essential towards preventing diseases of the mind, as Temperance contributes to hinder them attacking the Body.</P>
<P>That man ought to be deemed richest, who is the happiest; and he is the most like∣ly to become so, who, with a virtuous resig∣nation is prepared for the unavoidable evils which flesh is heir to; who expostulates with the folly and extravagance of his own desires, and though a hard task, at last convinces him∣self that what he likes best. is not always best for him; who preserves at all times, a decent equality of mind, is not arrogantly elated with the delusive smiles of Prosperity, nor servily cast down by the surly visage of Mis∣fortune.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
<P>The Organs of the Body may be entirely unfit to be acted upon by the Soul, when it remains wrapped up in itself, like a criminal in a Dungeon. Some people are born with imperfect nerves, which are stopt up, and never all their lives, unfold themselves, and shake off the Clog of Matter which obstruct them.</P>
<P>Though the Soul has a power over the in∣voluntary motions of the Body, in a healthy state; yet when the Body is diseased or im∣perfectly formed, the operation of the Soul then is irregular.</P>
<P>Even the strength of the Constitution is itself dangerous. Young people of excel∣lent Constitutions, apply themselves to study with indefatigable industry; the powerful action of the Soul increases that of the Organs, and they are attacked with inflam∣matory diseases, the consequence of irri∣tation long kept up in vigorous habits. Sometimes they expire in the first attack; more commonly they get the better of that; and if they find themselves perfectly re∣covered, their constitution recovering its vigour, they give themselves up again to the same labours, and relapse into the same dis∣orders. There are frequent instances of ro∣bust young men close applying to study▪ who are attacked with inflammatory fevers every
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>year; at last, in process of time, being worn out by these attacks and by their labours, they lose their strength, and are seized with con∣sumptive diseases, against which they are no longer able to resist.</P>
<P>Health is frequently destroyed by excessive devotion. An Author has collected several interesting observations on this head, in which devout Melancholy is well delineated; its symptoms are very unaccountable, alarming, and grievous; and there are few practitioners who have not had opportunities of seeing some shocking instances of this disease. The greatness and excellence of the object, and the satisfaction the Soul experiences in giv∣ing itself up to the contemplation of the Al∣mighty, excites too lively a Sensation, and produces in the Brain, attention too violent and too continual, to be supported for a long time together without Injury; it soon throws the soul into fanatical madness, and exhausts the Body. Some most amiable young Per∣sons, led away by an erronious System, fade and fall into decay, neglecting the duties of their calling, in order to give their thoughts up wholly to the supreme Author of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng, who could not have been more pro∣perly glorified than by a strict Attention to those duties. A Student is still regrated, One of the greatest abilities, born with strong
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>powers of the mind, whose candour and o∣ther Virtues would have been an acquisition to the Church; But who unfortunately de∣voted himself to a sect, of which he soon was the victim, the powers of his Body decaying as fast as his mind became more zealously in∣flamed.</P>
<P>Sometimes even the most lucky thoughts arise in the midst of recreation. One of the greatest Geniuses of our age computed his immortal works walking about in the Coun∣try. The Soul unfolds itself in open Air, but is imprisoned within the confined walls of a Study; it is elevated by the fragrance of Flowers, depressed by the smell of a Lamp. Plutarch's comparison on this subject is very just and excellent: "A little water," (says he,) "nourishes and strengthens "Plants; and a greater quantity stifles them." Thus it is with the mind; moderate labour is its food; excessive labour destroys it. When activity was mentioned as the second cause of the disorders here treated of, exercise was certainly represented at the same time, as one of the most powerful preservatives and re∣storers of the health of the Learned.</P>
<P>In the foregoing article, the advantages of open air have been considered, these are greatly enhanced, if accompanied with some degree of motion. The Learned in general,
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>are not sufficiently convinced of the influence the Body has on the Soul, although it was well known to our greatest men, who have been sensible that the Mind was subject to the powers of Physic as well as the Body, <Q>"The Soul, says Des Cartes, is so much influenc∣ed by the Constitution, and the State of the Bodily Organs, that if it were possible to find out a method of encreasing our pe∣netration, it should certainly be sought for in Medicine."</Q> Walking alone is very be∣neficial, but not quite sufficient; and it can∣not be too much recommended to them to ride out frequently on Horse-back; this kind of exercise is of use to the Head, the Breast, and the Viscera of the lower Belly, especially by preventing or dispelling their obstructions.</P>
<P>The hypocondriac disease may also be reckoned among the Evils learned Men are exposed to, from that kind of inactive life, which disturbing the circulation in the abdo∣dominal Viscera, produces obstructions in them. This di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ease generally attacks the In∣dolent, the Luxurious, the Unfortunate, and the Studious. Men of a Melancholy tem∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rament▪ whose minds are capable of great Attention, and whose passions are not easily moved, are in the advanced periods of Life, most liable to this disease. It may rather be called a complication of Maladies, than a
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>single one. To what a wretched condition are the best of Men often reduced by it! Their strength and appetite fail; a perpetual gloom hangs over their minds; they live in the constant dread of death, and are continu∣ally in search of relief from Medicine, where, alas! it is not to be found.</P>
<P>Those most liable to this Disease, are the Virtuous, the Valiant, the Brave, and those of an enlarged understanding, whom it would be the interest of the world to wish, they were free from that and every other illness; and except for that alloy, they would have too large a share of human happiness. To this we owe the irrepareable loss of Doctor Young, and the best and most approved Men that have appeared among us.</P>
<P>Hypochandriac persons ought never to fast long, and their food should be solid and nourishing, all acescent and windy vegetables are to be avoided. Flesh meats agree best with them, and their drink should be old Cla∣ret or generous Madeira.</P>
<P>In all persons afflicted with Nervous disor∣ders, there is a great, delicacy and sensibility of the whole Nervous System, and an un∣common degree of weakness of the Organs of digestion. These may be either natural or acquired. When owing to a defect in the
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>Constitution, they are hardly to be removed; but may be mitigated by proper care.</P>
<P>But Nervous Affections arise more fre∣quently from causes which it is, in a great measure, in our power to avoid, than from Diseases, or any Original fault in the Consti∣tution. Excessive grief. intense Study, im∣proper diet, and neglect of Exercise, are the great Sources of this extensive Class of dis∣eases.</P>
<P>Grief indulged destroys the appetite and digestion depresses the spirits. and induces an universal relaxation and debility of the whole System. Instances of this are daily to be seen. The loss of a relation, or any other misfor∣tune in Life, is often sufficient to occasion the most complicated series of Nervous symp∣toms Such misfortunes indeed are not to be avoided, but surely their effects, by a vigor∣ous and proper exertion of the mind, might be renderd less hurtful. The effects of in∣tense Study are pretty similar to those occasi∣oned by Grief. It preys upon the Animal Spirits, and destroys the appetite and digesti∣on To prevent these effects, studious Persons ought, according to the Poet, O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oy with their Books. They should never Study too long at a time; nor attend long to one particular Subject, especially if it be of a serious nature. They ought likewise to be attentive to their
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>posture, and should take care frequently to unbend their minds by music, diversions, or agreeable Company.</P>
<P>With regard to Diet, I shall only observe that Nervous diseases may be occasioned either by excess or inanition, both these extre∣mes hurt digestion, and vitiate the humours.</P>
<P>But the most general cause of Nervous dis∣orders is Indolence. The active and laborious are seldom troubled with them They are reserved for the Children of ease and afflu∣ence, who generally feel their keenest force. All I shall say to such Persons is, that the means of prevention and cure are both in their own power. If the Constitution of hu∣man nature be such, that man must either labour or suffer diseases. surely, no individual has any right to expect an exemption from the general rule.</P>
<P>If the stomach is bad, either naturally or from errors in diet, this Organ will be affected by the exercise of the mind, while the Nerves shall remain in a sound state; on the contrary, if the Nervous System is weak, and the Sto∣mach strong, Nervous diseases of great im∣portance, will be brought on before the Sto∣mach is Injured.</P>
<P>A fit of Illness, undigested food, or any similar cause often occasions broken uncon∣nected dreams, and prevents our receiving the
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>arising from sound sleep; the reason of which probably is, the fermentation and discordance of the nutritive juices▪ incapacitating our senses or organs (thro' which the soul is empowred to act) from being in a perfect state of rest, the soul must consequently partake of that irregular and unconnected quality, by which the bodily organs are at that juncture actuated: But in Death the case is quite re∣versed; the Soul, instead of being Clogg'd up and embarrassed by Bodily impediments is absolutely and entirely freed from them; for we cannot suppose it is longer confined to Nerves and Arteries, which there is no possi∣bility of its ever making any further use of, such a supposition must be ridiculous: So that in sleep the Soul's situation is directly contrary to what it must be in death; in the first case it is by material influence pre∣vented from exerting its powers, whereas in Death, that is, on its enlargement from its Material body it finds itself for the first time at full Liberty, and in full power of expanding and exerting them to the ut∣most.</P>
<P>It is evident that Virtue and Vice are not Constitutional, and dependent on any parti∣cular habit of Body, and tho' our material part, has an influence over the soul, in regard to the exertion of its Faculties, yet that influ∣ence,
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>extends only to the enlarging or con∣tracting our intellectual faculties, and not to our making a good or ill use of those facul∣ties, that rest solely in Ourselves, and if we make a wrong use of that power; if we un∣naturalize ourselves, as I may say, by deviat∣ing from the Paths of Virtue, whom are we to blame? The Deity who has formed us as we should be, or ourselves, who with an un∣grateful hand, rejected the opportunity he has given us of attaining virtue, and in conse∣quence, eternal felicity?</P>
<P>Are we not assured too, by the Deity, that according to our different abilities, situation, various contingencies &amp;c we shall hereafter be judged? Our actions will be scrutaniz'd in proportion to the talents entrusted to us, and according to the opportunities and incitements we have had, to make use of them and not taken in that superficial light, mor∣tals look on them: It is not those who have the greatest share of, but those who make the best use of their moral and intellectual powers, who will be regarded hereafter; justice and goodness are the Deity's Attributes, and by them we are hereafter to be judged: As to Idiots, &amp;c who (like the Brute Creation) are under the dominion of matter, at least, have as little power of exerting their facul∣ties, the Deity's Justice will hardly expect
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>from them duties, which it is impossible they should perform. What use they and many more beings are of in the Creation we know not; but let us not, short sighted as we are, for that reason arraign Divine wisdom: We are sure every part of the Creation was or∣dain'd for some wise purpose, tho' to what end we are perhaps ignorant; And in regard to the diversity of power, talents, &amp;c. which we observe among men, so far from being a blemish, they are a great pros of the Deity's Wisdom: Instead of their being the cause of confusion it is on that, the link which sup∣ports all, chiefly depends: was it otherways, half the omnipotent's Power and goodness on earth, would have been in vain.</P>
<P>We may assure ourselves, That Death, (which is indeed but the Souls Birth) instead of being a gloomy Messenger, is in reality our best Friend, since by his means we shall be freed from the fetters of the flesh, and in∣troduced into a state of freedom, Knowledge, and (I hope) Happiness, where our intellect∣ual Powers will have full scope: where we shall he all Ethereal Sense, and capable of in∣numerable Joys which in our present state we can have no conception of: as Swans are said to sing melodiously before Death, from an in∣stinct of some extraordinary Good approach∣ing, so should good men rejoice on their
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>elinquishing this mortal State: let us consider what happiness even in this life the contemp∣lation of an eternity produces! To indulge in the hopes of meeting again with our long-lost best beloved Friends; of living in intimacy and conversing with, not only the He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oes and Philosophers of all ages, but with Angels and other superior Beings; of indulging the amiable curiosity of searching into and ad∣miring the works of the Deity, thro' the im∣mensity of the creation, where infinite variety must prove an infinite fund of unspeakable, insatiable, and ever encreasing happiness; must not reflections like these animate our Spirits and stimulate us to virtue? I own I often in∣dulge the thought, and am never so happy as when I am thus, as it were, anticipating eter∣nity; besides, nothing contributes so much to cheerfulness, Religion, Humanity and all the social virtues, as the contemplation and hopes of a futurity; whereas to the contrary opinion, is ever united a melancholy which rankles within us, which preys upon our Spi∣rits, and which by divesting us or all fears of a future Judgment, encourages Vice; and too often induces us to give such a loose to our passions as makes us incapable of Happiness either in this world, or the world to come.</P>
<P>And for the Good and Virtuous, the cause of their Immortality is continually
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>creasing even in this world: The longer they exist, the more they improve in Knowledge and virtue and consequently, the more they merit an Eternity. We might as well suppose, the Deity should annihilate Angels, and other superior Beings, as the Souls of Virtuous Men. When we most please him, to imagine we shall be most se∣verely punished by him, were absurd; and surely to the virtuous and happy, Annihilation must be the most dreadful of Punishments. The Immateriality of the Soul implies too, that it is a Substance incorruptible and inva∣riable and consequently eternal, unless it shall please the Deity to annihilate it; and can we suppose, that Truth and Goodness, which are emanations from the Divine Creator, will not eternally exist?</P>
<P>Every part of the Creation evinces, in the most striking characters, the Existence of a Deity; and because we are not acquainted with the Nature and Essence of the Deity, shall we for that reason alone, doubt there is a Deity?</P>
<P>The Case is the same in all immaterial sub∣stances; nor is it possible for us to be admit∣ted to a nearer intimacy with them, while we are confined to this bodily prison, where, as I before observed, we can have no distinct idea
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>of any thing but what is material, since all our perceptions are the effects of material impuls∣es, and conveyed through material Organs to the Soul. The human understanding is limited to every human boundaries How many things are there, even in the ma∣terial Creation, which seem mysterious, and are kept from us? Yet this should not give us the least uneasiness, since what∣ever is available to our happiness here, or hereafter, is laid open to us. The knowledge of a Deity, and the Soul's existence, are truths absolutely necessary to make us happy and virtuous.</P>
<P>It is worth observing, That we are assured in Scripture, —<Q>"Angels and other spiritual Beings, neither Marry, nor are given in Marriage:"</Q> They all have one common Parent, The Almighty.</P>
<P>Our Bodies, like all other material systems are not designed for eternal duration, are ever variable, and so ordered, as to stand in need of daily recruits of Food, Sleep, &amp;c.: During our sleep, a swoon, or any similar cause, the Soul being embarrassed and clogged up, as it were, is in a state of Deliquium at least, if it does think, its actions are so incon∣gruous, as not to be traced in our waking hours notwithstanding which, we are not to suppose that the Soul is in reality more defective then,
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>than at another time; but the Organs, thro' which it is obliged to act, being obstructed, its faculties are consequently impeded. If we lose our Eye-fight Or hearing, the Soul is not in the least maimed thereby, it has but lost its Instrument or Bodily Organ, its original power is still the same; and were our optical or auditory Organs reduced to order, the Soul would again re-exert its usual Faculties.</P>
<P><Q>"Thus," as an Author observes, the Musician cannot, if his Instrument be dis∣order'd, bring forth any harmony; his skill, nevertheless, remains; which, on the Instrument's being re-put in order, he again exhibits."</Q> Idiotism, Forgetfulness, Dot∣age, &amp;c. are not Weaknesses of the Soul, but of the Senses; and we are not to suppose, our Immaterial Principle, in such cases, loses its fa∣culties, more than the Sun loses his meridian brightness, when hid from us, by dark clouds intervening. Thus, during Sleep, which is absolutely necessary to the refreshment of our Bodily part, we must suppose, there is such a relaxation of our material Organs, that our whole System becomes too languid for the Soul to be capable of exerting its Active fa∣culties; but when the Body is recruited with proper strength, the Soul recovers its pristine power; it again dictates to, and governs the
<PB N="49" REF="51" MS="y"/>Body, and we may perceive it is the same thinking Principle, the very same Soul that actuated us before Sleep. Matter cannot divest the Soul of its faculties, though it can render it impossible for it to exert them upon the Body; which may be disordered so, as not to be directed by it. The Soul's Faculties then are not annihilated, but suspended from Action: or to speak more properly, are wrap∣ped up in itself. A Being may undoubtedly exist, without giving appearance of its exist∣ence. The Soul, therefore, may exist, with∣out giving signs of its existence, or affecting Matter, so as to be conscious of its own exist∣ence: as in sleep, without dreaming, it re∣mains the same invariable essence; though the Indisposition of the Bodily Organs renders it impossible to display those faculties, from whence thought and reflection come.</P>
<P>The Soul h impassible, consequently in∣capable of change: all the changes that hap∣pen to an individual, arise from the different affections of the Bodily Organs. The Soul of a new-born Child is the same as that of an Old Man; and that of a Fool, as that of a Philosopher.</P>
<P>The Bodily Organs, on Which the opera∣tions of the Soul depend, greatly vary; by which, the exercise of its Faculties are pro∣portionably lessened or improved: but it's
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>particular existence, faculties and powers re∣main the same, impassible to the Laws of Matter and Motion. The difference between the lowest and most abject, and the highest and most elevated natural capacity, depends upon the Instruments by which the Soul acts, and is affected; which seem to us to alter its operations. The cause is in the Material Or∣gans, which make representations of its oper∣ation, according to their just or imperfect Mechanism. If the Bodily Organs happen to be perfectly Organized, and exactly modu∣lated to receive and convey to the Sensorium or Seat of the Soul, the ideas of Objects, with a proper impulse, then it exerts its faculties in a reasonable manner: the Senses receive a just or sufficient degree of impulse from the Objects; which impulse the Organs convey, in a just and sufficient degree, which excites in the Soul, the distinct idea of the object.</P>
<P>The brightest Wits, the most exalted Un∣derstandings, may be reduced to a level with the most abject, stupid, and unintelligent Fool. By the Mechanical Affections of Mat∣ter and Motion, we often see a Man of the brightest parts, and most enlarged under∣standing, who hath penetrated into the secret recesses of nature, despoiled of all his Wisdom and noble endowments, by the tyranny of a violent Nervous Fever, &amp;c. Thus we behold
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>him now divested of the exercise of his Fa∣culties. But can we suppose this change made in the Soul itself? No: certainly it remains the same, and differs not from what it was before. Recover him from the Fever, &amp;c. and remove the impediment it hath thrown upon the Organs of the Senses, and the ex∣ercise of all the Faculties of the Soul returns; his Parts brighten, his understanding revives, and, in short, he becomes in every respect, the same amiable Person as he was, before the Fever, &amp;c seized him.</P>
<P>Thus we see, that the Bodily Organs may be so disorder'd, or the Stimulus, applied to them, so great, as to put it out of the Soul's power to suspend or contract them; and tho' it is the source of all motion, both voluntary and involuntary, yet it may be reduced to an Inactive passive State, or forced into involun∣tary Action.</P>
<P>Though all voluntary Motion proceeds from the immediate influence of the Soul, yet some of the voluntary motions, by the force of custom and habit, come at length to be performed with little or no attention of the Soul, tho' it has full power to begin or stop the Motion when it pleases. Thus a Man may Walk, and not be sensible of it; have an Object before him, without seeing it; and put his hand to a Thing, without feeling
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>it; because he is intent upon something else, therefore overlooks these smaller sensations; and these voluntary motions are, in some degree, mechanically performed.</P>
<P>I believe it will be allowed, that our Ideas or thoughts are immaterial; that is, are not bodily substances. Who ever thought there was any thing corporeal in a Judgement, a Doubt, &amp;c? If our Thoughts are corporeal, where could they be lodged? How infinitely complicated and extended must that material Soul be, to be able to contain those immense volumes of learning, which some Men have treasured up in their Souls.</P>
<P>The large size, the wonderful texture, great care and security, the God of Nature has employed about the Brain, make it high∣ly probable, that it is designed for the noblest uses:—the Temple, Tabernacle, or Dwelling House of That <HI>Immaterial Being,</HI> That <HI>Im∣mortal Guest,</HI> I hat That <HI>Spark of the Deity,</HI> That <HI>Breath of Life,</HI> THE LIVING SOUL or MAN.</P>
<P>Every thing we say or do, our every Action and Thought, proves and ascertains the rea∣lity of the Soul: the very doubting its Exist∣ence, is a strong proof of it. Whence pro∣ceeds the Power of Doubting? It is evident, that the particles of matter of which our Bodies are formed were not long since life∣less
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>vegitative Particles, for which we are in∣debted to the Fields that nourish'd and pro∣duced them, and which are but transplanted, as it were, into another soil: These particles of matter, tho' differently modified and form∣ed into a most surprizing piece of mechanism, are in reality (as to their original power and nature) the same, and as incapable of thought, self motion &amp;c. as when growing in the Field, Matter, it is true, by a proper modification, may become a fit dwelling for Thinking Being; what then shall we call that Principle within us which doubts, which reflects, which dictates to us, and sways us in every Action of Life? What is it that endows us with the power of self-motion, which enables to re∣collect past actions, to look forward into fu∣turity, and in a manner, to foretel future consequences? It is certainly somewhat of a Different nature from the lifeless particles of which our Bodies are formed: it is some∣what, which, tho' we cannot rightly define, we are sure is somewhat; and this it is we call, THE SOUL.</P>
<P>While the Body is kept in order, the Soul is easy; when it is not, the Soul is in pain. When the functions of the Body cease, the Soul quits the Association, but exists in a se∣parate state. For as every particle of the body (however transformed) will remain after the
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>separation, so will the Soul also; for whatever has once received a Being from God, cannot cease to be without his interposition. We are told in Scripture, That man is made after God's own Image. Now, as the Deity cannot be supposed a material Being, what can it imply but that our Being like him, is an Immate∣rial Immortal substance, endowed with Rea∣son, Reflection, and the power of distinguish∣ing between good and evil &amp;c It is, it must be owned a very bold Eastern Metaphor, as the difference and distance between us is so Inexpressible.</P>
<P>In describing the Bliss of Immortal Beings, we have while in this life, no ideas more ex∣pressive than those which depend on the sen∣ses of seeing and hearing, which senses seem principally designed for the service of our immortal Part, and may be call'd vehicles for the Soul's Food, as those of tasting, smelling and feeling, are designed purely for the Bo∣dy's use. After Death, the Soul will doubt∣less, be gifted with many powers and inlets to happiness, or misery, which we at present can have no idea of.</P>
<P>It has been a received opinion in all ages, that immensity swarms with invisible imma∣terial Beings, who are the Agents of Provi∣dence, and witnesses of our most private ac∣tions.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
<P>The thought of our existance terminating with this Life naturally checks the Soul in any generous pursuit, contracts her views, and fixes them on temporary and selfish ends; It dethrones the reason, extinguishes all noble and heroic Sentiments; encourages Lust, Fraud, Violence, and all kind of Vice, by which, a Man may wickedly make his For∣tune, or indulge a pleasure without fear of temporal damage, either in Reputation, Health, or Fortune: In short, the inward compunctions of a wicked, as well as the joys of an upright mind, are grafted on the As∣surance of another state.</P>
<P>Hence arise the natural Hopes and fears of men; hence spring the means of future rewards, and appearing pleasing to the Deity, tho' persecuted in this world, and likewise the inward stings of Conscience and dread of pu∣nishment attending prosperous Vice, tho' hid from Human eyes.</P>
<P>As it is probable that there may be differ∣ent Degrees of happiness for Souls, in pro∣portion as they have been more or less per∣fect, it is as probable too, that in those stati∣ons, Souls will be furnished with opportuni∣ties of eternally improving in Virtue and knowlege, and consequently of increasing in happiness; notwithstanding, which gradation to perfection, they most ever remain infinite∣ly
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>distant from the Deity, who is Perfection itself.</P>

<P>O MAN, greatly beloved by thy Creator! The Darling of Providence thou art distinguished by his goodness; distinguish thyself also by thy one undivided aim to glo∣rify him, who has been at so much expence to gratify thee;—while all these inferior creatures in silent eloquence declare the glory of God, do thou lend them thy tongue, be thou the High Priest of the mute Creation; let their Praise become vocal in thy songs. Adore the supreme Benefactor, for the bles∣sings he showers down upon every order of beings; adore him for numberless mercies which are appropriated to thyself: But above all, adore him for that Noble gift of a Ration∣al and immortal Soul.</P>
<P>A celebrated modern Author has ele∣gantly expressed his sentiments on this subject.</P>
<Q><P>"O ye timerous Souls, that are terrified at the found of the passing Bell, That turn pale at the fight of an opened Grave, and can scarce behold a Coffin or a Skull, without a shuddering horror."</P>
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
<P>"O Eternity! Eternity! how are our boldest; our strongest thoughts lost and overwhelmed in thee! Who can set land-marks to limit thy dimensions, or find Plumbers to fathom thy depths? Arethmeticians have figures to compute all the progressions of time; Astro∣nomers have instruments to calculate the di∣stances of the Plannets; but what numbers can state, what Lines gauge, the lengths and breadths of Eternity? "It is higher than Heaven, what canst thou do? deeper than Hell, what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the earth, broader than the sea" Mysterious, mighty exist∣ence! a Sum not to be lessened by the largest deductions! an extent not to be contracted by all possible diminutions! none can truly say, after the most prodigious waste of ages, "So much of Eternity is gone:" for when millions of Centuries are elapfed, it is but just commencing; and when millions more have run their ample round, it will not be nearer ending. Yea, when ages, numerous as the bloom of Spring; encreased by the Herbage of Summer, both augmented by the Leaves of Autumn, and all multiplied by the drops of rain, which drown the Winter—when these, and ten thousand times ten thousand more—more than can be represented by any similitude, or imagined by any conception—
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>when all these are revolved and finished, Eter∣nity, vast, boundless amazing Eternity, will only be beginning.</P>
<P>"Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour till the <HI>Evening;</HI> but then his strength fails, his Spirits fly, and he stands in need not only of some respite from Toil, but of some kindly and sovereign refreshment: what an admirable provision for this purpose is sleep! sleep introduces a most welcome vacation both for the Soul and Body: The exercises of the brain, and the labours of the hand, are at once discontinued; so that the weary limbs repair their exhausted vigour, while the pensive thoughts drop their load of sorrows, and the busy ones rest from the fatigue of application. Most reviving Cordial! equally beneficial to our Animal and intellectual powers: It supplies the fleshly machine, and keeps all its nice Movements in a proper posture for easy play: It animates the think∣ing faculties with fresh Alacrity, and rekindles their Ardour for the Studies of the Dawn; without these enlivening recruits, how soon would the most robust constitution be wasted into a walking Skeleton, and the most learn∣ed Sage degenerate into a Hoary Idiot.</P>
<P>"How many of our Fellow creatures are, at this very Instant, confined to the bed of lang∣uishing, and complaining with that illustrious
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>sufferer of old, "Wearisome nights are ap∣pointed to me;" Instead of indulging soft repose, they are counting the tedious hours; telling every striking Clock; or measuring the very moments by their throbbing Pulse</P>
<P>"How many harrassed with pain, most pas∣sionately long to make some little truce with their agonies in peaceful slumbers! How many sick with disquietude, and restless even, on their downy Pillows, would purchase this transient oblivion of their woes almost at any rate! That which wealth cannot procure, which multitudes sigh for in vain, thy God has bestowed on thee, times out of number.</P>
<P>"But (sweet recollection! Ravishing Expec∣tation!) the Songs of Saints in Light never admit a Pause for sadness: All Heaven will resound with the Melody of their Gratitude, and all Eternity echo to their Triumphant ac∣clamations! The Hallelujahs of that world, and the harmonious Joy of it's Inhabitants, will be as lasting as the Divine Perfections they celebrate. Come then, Holy Love, and tune my Heart! descend, celestial Fire, and touch my Tongue! that I may stand ready to strike up, and bear my part in that great Hosanna, that everlasting Hymn.</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, ye flowery nations, ye must all decay; and, indeed, could you add the strength of an oak, or the stability of a Py∣ramid,
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>to all the delicacy of your texture, yet short, exceeding short, even then, would your Duration be; for I see, "that all things come to an end," The pillars of nature are tottering the foundations of the round world are falling away: "The heavens themselves wax old like a garment." But, amidst these views of general ruin, he is our refuge: this is our consolation, "we know that our Re∣deemer liveth."</P>
<P>"What a striking argument is here for re∣signation, unfeigned resignation, to all the disposals of providence! too often are our dissatisfied thoughts apt to find fault with di∣vine dispensations. We tacitly arraign our makers conduct, or question his kindness with regard to ourselves; we fancy our lot not so comodiously situated, or our conditi∣on not so happily circumstanced, as if we had been placed in some other station of life.</P>
<P>"Be still, then, thou uneasy mortal; know that God is unerringly wise; and be assured that amidst the greatest multiplicity of beings He does not overlook thee. Thou art of far superior value in the estimate of omnipo∣tence than all the herbage of the field. If his sacred will ordains sickness for thy por∣tion, never dare to imagine that uninterrupt∣ed health would be more advantageous. If he pleases to withhold or carry away children
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>never presume to conclude that thy happi∣ness is blasted because thy hopes of an en∣creasing family are disappointed. He that marshalls all the starry host, and so accurately arranges every the meanest species of herbs, he orders all the peculiarities, all the changes of thy state with a vigilence that nothing can elude, with a goodness that endureth for e∣ver. Bow thy head, therefore, in humble acquiescence. Rest satisfied that "whatever is," by the appointment of Heaven, "is right, is best." Alas! how blind are mortals to future events! how unable to discern what is really good.</P>
<P>"Fools often account the life of the righte∣ous but madness, and their end to be with∣out honour, but they are number'd among the children of God; and their lot, their di∣stinguish'd and eternal lot, is among the saints. However, therefore, an undiscerning world may despise, and a profane world vilify the truly religious, be this the Supreme, the invariable desire of my heart; "Let me live the life, and die the death of the righteous, Oh! let my latter end and future state be like theirs"</P>
<P>"But most of all, in that tremendous day, when the heavens are rent assunder, and wrapped up like a scroll; when the Almighty arm shall arrest the sun in his career, and
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>dash to pieces the structure of the Universe; when the dead both small and great, shall be gathered before the throne of glory, and the fate of all mankind shall hang on the very point of a final irreversible decision, then, Blessed JESUS let us be owned by thee, and we shall not be ashamed, defended by thee, and we shall not be afraid, O! may we at that awful, that unutterably important junc∣ture, be covered with the wings of thy re∣deeming love, and we shall behold all the horrible convulsions of expiring nature, with composure, with comfort! we shall even wel∣come the dissolution of all things, as the "times of refreshing from the presence of the LORD"</P></Q>
<P>Almighty God! Eternal Sovereign of the universe! whose intelligence I perticipate by whose power I am sustained, whose existence and attributes investigate, whose impulses I seem to feel incessantly prompting all my ac∣tive powers to exert themselves for universal good; to what sacred light, what unexpolr∣ed source shall I fly for information! How shall I dissipate the gloomy uncertainty, whose incumbent horror depresses all my being, and leaves its brightest hopes, its noblest enter∣prizes absorbed in endless and infinite despair? in vain am I told that, upon the mixture of
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>the Human character, depend the varieties of its fortune. Misery is indeed the native con∣sequente of vice; but why should vice take place in human nature? that error and mistake are the result of limited powers, I can easily grant; but will it follow from thence, that uninterrupted peace and tranquility are incompatible with finite existence? Is there no supposable state, in which a mind, though cir∣cumscribed in its powers, and confined to a particular sphere of action, may be free from misery?</P>
<P>God of nature! to whose eyes the depth of Eternal wisdom, the numberless vicissitudes of infinite possibility are obvious? why am I, and all the fraternal race of Men, born to the wretched inheritance of inexpiable guilt and immoveable wo? as images reflected by the polished surface of an opaque body, vanish in swift sucession, without impressing any mark of their existence, and leave the open expanse unoccupied for others; so swiftly pass the fluctuating race of men, friends and allies robbed of half themselves, dissolved in tears and anguish; whilst expiring guilt en∣tails on its connexions the detestable heritage of shame and execration.</P>
<P>Father of the human spirit! amidst the general confusion of things, in which the beams of thy gracious countenance alter∣nately
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>sink in impenetrable darkness, or e∣merge in celestial glory to mortal Eyes; still, still my Soul perswades me, not only of thy Existence, but of its infinite and inseparable perfections.</P>
