<HEAD>THE <HI>Epistle Dedicatory.</HI> TO THE Right Reverend Father in GOD, Dr. <HI>John Moore,</HI> Lord Bishop of <HI>ELY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Lordship,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN indispensible Necessity, obliging me to vindicate my Reputation in the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Practise</HI> of Physick, against the Malicious Calumnies and De∣tractions of my <HI>Enemies;</HI> who
<PB REF="3"/>are only those of my own <HI>Pro∣fession,</HI> and such as are <HI>unwarily</HI> prejudic'd by their False and Scandalous Insinuations; I hope I shall not be charg'd either with <HI>Vanity</HI> or <HI>Rashness</HI> in Publishing these brief <HI>Essays;</HI> which are de∣sign'd for no other end, but that by reading this little <HI>Mannual,</HI> those that are Strangers to my Person, may be convinc'd, that in Studying Physick, I have fol∣lowed such Learned Guides and Patterns, by whose Directions and Examples, and my own <HI>Expe∣rience,</HI> joined with a tolerable <HI>Capacity,</HI> and an indefatigable <HI>In∣dustry</HI> and Diligence, that I am legally qualified for the Exercise of the <HI>Art</HI> I profess, maugre the inveterate <HI>Malice</HI> of all Op∣posers.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> My Life and Con∣versation, I bless God, being unattackable, even by Envy it
<PB REF="4"/>self, and so being no Reproach to the Name I have the Ho∣nour to bear: And your Lord∣ship being Celebrated for your <HI>Exemplary</HI> Piety, Charity, and <HI>profound</HI> Knowledge in <HI>Physick,</HI> as well as in all other Learned and useful <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> and consequently a Proper and <HI>Sufficient</HI> Judge, of the Contents of the following <HI>Treatise.</HI></P>
<P>I have humbly presum'd to <HI>Dedicate</HI> it to your good Lord∣ship, in great Sincerity, but in very plain Language; for if <HI>Nature</HI> had been more kind and liberal to me in <HI>Eloquent</HI> and <HI>Rhetorical</HI> Expressions, I durst not have used them to your Lord∣ship, who takes more Delight in <HI>doing good</HI> to others, than in read∣ing <HI>deserved Panegyricks</HI> on your self.</P>

<HEAD>A PRACTICAL DISCOURSE, Shewing the <HI>Origine, Seat, Symptoms, Cause,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Intro∣duction in defence of the Au∣thor.</NOTE>IF ever any Person upon the Face of the Universe, that Dedicated his whole Life to the <HI>doing good,</HI> and rendring himself <HI>Bene∣ficial</HI> to Mankind, has reason to complain of the Ill and Barbarous usage he has en∣countred, from Men of his own <HI>Profession,</HI> and others of a <HI>Superior</HI> Station, that pre∣tend Authority to <HI>License</HI> or <HI>Suppress,</HI> all Practioners in the Noble and Useful Arts of <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> and <HI>Administring</HI> Physick, <HI>I am the Man;</HI> for ever since I took my leave of the Old and Useless way of giving Phy∣sick, as too many others do, <HI>Blindfold, by Traditional Prescriptions,</HI> and made it my whole
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>Study and Business to keep up an entire Correspondence and Agreement between <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Nature, Theory</HI> and <HI>Practice;</HI> and made exact and particular Observations in the <HI>difference</HI> of Diseases, the variety of <HI>Symptoms,</HI> casual <HI>Accidents,</HI> and the diversity of <HI>Con∣stitutions</HI> in Humane Bodies; and have followed the dictates of a <HI>well-grounded Experi∣ence,</HI> in finding out the <HI>Essence</HI> of Diseases, and the <HI>Efficacy</HI> of Proper Medicines <HI>to Cure them.</HI> The whole Tribe of <HI>common</HI> Practioners, and some <HI>graduated</HI> Professors of Physick, that live lazing upon the little Knowledge that comes by <HI>Tradition,</HI> and by stuffing their <HI>Bills,</HI> and <HI>Patients</HI> with Nauseous Re∣petitions, of unexperienc'd and consequently <HI>ineffectual</HI> Medicines; have both unsuffer∣ably calumniated, traduced and slander'd me, with many ridiculous Stories and un∣just <HI>Censures,</HI> as well as loaded me with such hard and <HI>reproachful</HI> Names, as none but the <HI>bountiful</HI> bestowers of them can deserve; so that I am forc'd, to prevent others from being <HI>prejudiced</HI> by false Reports and mali∣cious Insinuations, to take this way of vin∣dicating my Reputation, against the <HI>Insults</HI> of Envious Men, who are as utter Stran∣gers to my Person and Abilities, as them∣selves are from the common Principles of <HI>Modesty, Civility and good Manners.</HI></P>
<P>I could with great facility recriminate upon my Enemies, but I never thought a <HI>Billings-Gate Dialect</HI> any Ornament, or an advantageous Character to a Sober Chri∣ftian, which is seldom used, but by a buisy sort of <HI>Tatling</HI> Animals, who are out of Humour with every Body, because their own ill nature will not suffer 'em to be
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>pleas'd with themselves. Let <HI>Maevius</HI> and <HI>Bavius</HI> then admire one another, and rail at all the World besides; I shall for the future be unconcern'd at those who are as full of unjust Reproaches, as they are void of good Breeding. I <HI>wish</HI> to be hated by self-interested <HI>Slanderers</HI> and their Abettors, for the same reason for which I <HI>desire</HI> to be belov'd by all Ingenious, well meaning ho∣nest Men, under all Denominations; as for the rest, I shall say with the Poet</P>
<Q><L><HI>Ʋrg'd by the Base, I'm unconcern'd the while,</HI></L>
<L><HI>At least regard it with a scornful Smile;</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Twere mean to think of Vengeance on the Vile.</HI></L></Q>
<P>However, since I know not how far their Hatred, inveterate and implacable <HI>Malice</HI> may extend to my prejudice, among those that know not my <HI>veritable</HI> Character, I shall here employ a few Lines to answer all the Objections they have <HI>raised,</HI> and <HI>industri∣ously</HI> scatter'd to blast my Reputation in the Practice of Physick, which I have followed with great Success for many Years, and which the worst of my Enemies cannot de∣ny, without assurance enough to affirm, that the Sun is not risen, when to their <HI>shame,</HI> it shines in their Faces from its Illustrious Meridian.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections against the Author.</NOTE>The first Quarter in which my professed Enemies attack me, is, <HI>That I am but an Apothecary:</HI> 'Tis true, I lay claim to no greater Title, and yet cannot forbear say∣ing, That that Objection is <HI>Ridiculous;</HI> since being an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> well versd in <HI>Phar∣macy,</HI> in the Knowledge of <HI>Drugs,</HI> and the <HI>Composition</HI> of Medicines, is, the most cer∣tain
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>and regular step towards the making of a good Physician: As has been proved by many Examples in <HI>London</HI> and other Places, where Men that servd their Times to Apothecaries, and kept Shop many Years, have afterwards took their Degree of <HI>Doctor</HI> in one of our own Universities, and pra∣ctised with as great Applause, and it may be with more <HI>Success,</HI> than the rest of their <HI>only</HI> Graduated Brethren. Nor is this method unobserved in other Learned Employments; for many Wise Men say, That the way to make an able <HI>Counsellor,</HI> is, First to educate him as a <HI>Clerk</HI> to an <HI>At∣torney.</HI> Having thus blown off this igno∣rant and contemptible Objection, I proceed to the Second; which is, <HI>That I never had, an Ʋniversity Education, but am a mere Ignoramus,</HI> as they are pleas'd to Phrase it; But how will they prove their latter Allegation? Did they ever Examine into my Learning and Ability? Do they know my Incapa∣city to perform what I undertake? If they did, without doubt I should long since have heard of it in <HI>louder</HI> Terms, than by Private Whispers, Malicious Insinuations and Secret Calumnies and Aspersions; but such is their Hatred, that what they dare not aver to my Face, or attempt to prove by <HI>Argument,</HI> they liberally supply by false Reports, and forged Clandestine Stories of my Insufficiency, against a Thousand <HI>credible</HI> Certificates and <HI>Reputable</HI> Testimonies to the contrary; and these I think sufficient to stop the Mouths of <HI>Detraction</HI> and <HI>Envy,</HI> in the Opinion of all good People; and for o∣thers, that are <HI>mislead</HI> by my <HI>Numerous</HI> Ad∣versaries into <HI>uncharitable</HI> Censures of me;
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>let them but consider, that my Enemies treat me on the score of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> for my safe and short way of <HI>Practice,</HI> and a great number of Patients diminishing their <HI>Profit,</HI> they will not wonder that I am con∣demn'd in an <HI>Arbitrary</HI> Court, where <HI>Ma∣lice is the Prosecuter, <HI>Interest</HI> sits as Judge, and sordid <HI>Ignorance</HI> is <HI>Fore-Man</HI> of the Jury. I confess, I have not had the Advantage of an <HI>Academick</HI> Education, but am a sincere lover of <HI>Learning,</HI> and desirous of Know∣ledge, and tho' I cannot boast of posses∣sing much, yet I can astute all Censorious <HI>Pedants,</HI> that by conversing with Learned Men, and a well chosen Library, I take as much pains to <HI>encrease</HI> my Knowledge, as some of them do by insignificant <HI>Diversions,</HI> and notorious <HI>Debaucheries,</HI> to lose what they gain'd, if ever they gain'd <HI>any</HI> thing but <HI>Words</HI> at the Ʋniversity.</HI> Besides, this cavil is wholly <HI>Impertinent,</HI> since its well known, beyond a possibility of Contradi∣ction, that I am Master of good <HI>Specificks,</HI> and <HI>establish'd</HI> experimented Medicines, of my own <HI>Preparing,</HI> which <HI>Prescribing?</HI> Physici∣ans cannot pretend to, tho' of the greatest Consequence to Mankind, and whose effi∣cacious Vertues I am sure of, and can rely upon, in the most <HI>difficult</HI> plunging Cases in respect of Safety, and generally with Suc∣cess; and all this confirmed by numerous Testimonies of <HI>Cured</HI> Patients, which I am of Opinion, is all that ought t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be required of a <HI>good</HI> Physician; and yet for want of the empty Title of <HI>Doctor,</HI> and a <HI>Coach</HI> and Equipage, I must, it seems, be called <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Emperick,</HI> by chose <HI>Doni</HI> of the Pro∣fession, who have not much more Skill in
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>the true Practice of Physick, which I take to be the <HI>Cure of Diseases,</HI> than what they collect from the old exploded <HI>Methodus Medendi,</HI> which when the World grows Wiser, will vanish into its original <HI>nothing,</HI> and give place <HI>to</HI> solid, certain and veri∣table <HI>Experience</HI> in the Cure of Diseases.</P>
<P>And that I may contribute to this great <HI>End,</HI> of advancing <HI>useful</HI> Knowledge in Phy∣sick, and that my Enemies may not think I am reduced to a <HI>perpetual</HI> silence in my own just Defence, by their vain <HI>Threatnings</HI> and <HI>injurious</HI> Misrepresentations of my Person and Capacity for the Practice of Physick, I have taken up a resolution to Print se∣veral <HI>Discourses</HI> upon <HI>those</HI> Diseases, that God has bless'd me with the Knowledge of, and given me wonderful success in their Cures, that have frequently baffled the Endeavours of many Eminent <HI>Professors:</HI> And shall be∣gin with a Treatise upon the CHOLICK.</P>
<P>Now in discoursing this Subject, to avoid all unnecessary and over Nice and Curious Distinction, and Definitions, that rather puzzle Men's Intellects, than benefit their Understandings, I shall under the general Name, vulgarly called <HI>Cholick,</HI> treat of it as an Accidental and Particular Distemper, arising from an evident Cause alone, and without a previous disposition in any Per∣son indifferently; for so, alterations in the <HI>Sex No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naturalia</HI> often raise great commotions in the <HI>Viscera</HI> of the Belly with extremity of Pain: After that, I shall consider this Disease in its <HI>Procartick</HI> or <HI>pre-existent</HI> Cause, as co-operating with others that are sub∣sequent, which will necessarily lead me to
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>particular Discourses upon the various kinds, and the several Species of this Distemper under the denominations of the Cholick in the <HI>Stomach;</HI> the <HI>Hysterick</HI> Cholick, the <HI>Scor∣butick</HI> Cholick; the <HI>Iliack Passion,</HI> the <HI>Caeliack</HI> Cholick, a <HI>Diarrhea,</HI> a <HI>Lientary,</HI> a <HI>Dysentry,</HI> &amp;c. All which Distempers I shall treat particularly, and to avoid Confusion and over burthening the Memory, under every Head I shall shew the <HI>Origine Seminium</HI> or <HI>Minera</HI> of each Disease; what part of the Body is <HI>primarily</HI> affected; then proceed to the <HI>Symptoms</HI> and Method of <HI>Cure,</HI> and con∣clude with some Observations and Exam∣ples, wherein my own Medicines have been wonderfully successful; which I always keep ready prepared by me, to dispose of, to all that think fit to come or send for them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Essence or Nature of the Cho∣lick.</NOTE>The Cholick called in <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in <HI>Latin Collica Passio,</HI> because by some Physitians, 'tis supposed, tho' falsly, to have its seat wholly in some part or other of the Se∣cond of the great Guts, called <HI>Colon;</HI> is a Vellication or severe Griping, Twitching, Gnawing Pain in certain Parts of the <HI>Ab∣domen,</HI> which commonly produce Vomit∣ings, Cramps and Contractions, almost of all the <HI>Viscera</HI> of the Belly: Sometimes the Navel and its Neighbouring Parts are drawn inward, accompanied with Pains as if they were boared with a Gimlet: Sometimes they swell, being blown up with the excess of Wind: The <HI>Intestines</HI> by an inverted Motion of the <HI>Fibres</HI> are often drawn up∣wards, insomuch that the Belly being ex∣treamly bound, discharges little or nothing at all; nay, tho' it be frequently provoked to do it by Glysters and Suppositories, yet
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>it does not easily throw out its Con∣tents.</P>
<P>That the Stomach is likewise convulsed with the <HI>Duodenum</HI> and Gall Bladder, mani∣festly appears from the plentiful vomiting of Yellow or Green Choler. Sometimes the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> and the Bladder which contains the Urine, are so contracted, that during the whole Fit, the Urine is either stopt, or voided more sparingly: Besides, the Head is grieved with <HI>Vertiginous</HI> effects, either preceding or following the invasion of this Disease, and if the Cholick encreases and becomes <HI>Inveterate,</HI> it often causes Pain in the outward Members and terminates in a <HI>Palsey.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its direful Effects.</NOTE>Nay, the Sick commonly endures all kinds of Pains; one while <HI>burning</HI> with intole∣rable <HI>Heat,</HI> another time <HI>chill'd</HI> with extream <HI>Cold;</HI> sometimes it seems to be fix'd and as it were piercing the <HI>Loins,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther whiles <HI>pricking</HI> with <HI>wandring</HI> repeated <HI>Thrusts;</HI> anon <HI>distending</HI> or <HI>beating</HI> the Loins, or only <HI>pressing</HI> them with the <HI>sense of weight,</HI> or <HI>burning, corroding, rending</HI> Pain; or is troubled either with a <HI>continual</HI> or <HI>interrupted Pulsation,</HI> and afterward returning again, or wonder∣fully <HI>writhing</HI> and <HI>contorting</HI> any other way, scarce to be expressed by the Patient, or explain'd by the Physician.</P>
<P>Now tho' all the differences occurring in this Distemper with its <HI>Original</HI> are very difficult to be assign'd, numbred, or re∣duced into a certain Order, and much more to make an exact Examination of all the <HI>Symptoms</HI> and <HI>Causes,</HI> and thence to give a sollid judgment of every one; yet I shall attempt it, by exhibiting them from the
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>best Authorities, and leave the choice to your own Election, as they are most agree∣able to your Reason and <HI>Experience,</HI> which is the Mistress both of the Learned and Unskilful.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Origin of the Cho∣lick.</NOTE>Some are of Opinion that the <HI>Origine</HI> of this Disease, proceeds from the effervescency of vicious Blood; others from an Obstruction of the <HI>Capillary</HI> Veins of the Stomach and Guts, by which the <HI>Blood</HI> is forced to stand still in the <HI>Vessels,</HI> till at length after a great <HI>Distention</HI> the Vessels burst and the Blood is effussed, which breeds a sensible Inflamation and violent Pulsation about the Part affected. Others say it arises from an over <HI>viscous Phlegm</HI> mix'd with <HI>Choler,</HI> of∣fensive both in its Saltish <HI>Acrimony</HI> and Vo∣latile <HI>Oiliness,</HI> by which the <HI>Viscous</HI> Phlegm is rarified into <HI>Wind,</HI> and if the Excrements are contain'd beyond their due time, they harden and stick to the Gut, by which the natural <HI>Ferment</HI> is viciated, and the Windy Gusts are more rarified, and being shut up in the <HI>Cavity</HI> of the Gut <HI>Colon</HI> it causes a violent distension and contraction of it.</P>
<P>Some again impute it the disorders and Convulsions of the <HI>Nerves</HI> running from the Mesenterick <HI>Plexus,</HI> which vicious hu∣mours as aforesaid, lodg'd in the <HI>Intestines,</HI> and those by a Forreign <HI>irritation</HI> of their <HI>Nerves,</HI> equally attended by the successive returns of <HI>Cold,</HI> and <HI>Heat,</HI> cause tearing, wringing and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>cting Pains.</P>
<P>Others ascribe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Original to the a∣bounding Acidity and Acrimony of the <HI>Pancreatick juice,</HI> occasion'd by over sharp Food; eating raw Fruits, by Summer <HI>Air</HI> too Hot, by Winter Air too <HI>Cold,</HI> or at least
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>too <HI>Sharp;</HI> by <HI>Fear, Sorrow, extream Grief or Solicitude of Mind;</HI> by continued <HI>Watchings</HI> which consume the <HI>Animal</HI> Spirits, and by consequence encreasing the Acrimony of any Humours, produce <HI>Hypocondriack suffocations,</HI> and also Pains, severely racking and con∣torting the <HI>Guts.</HI> Now the Reasons why I cannot agree with many Physicians, that Cholick Pains proceed from the sharp and irritative contents of the <HI>Colon,</HI> is, because those Medicines which loosen the Belly, and copioussly expel <HI>Featus</HI>'s and the <HI>Faeces,</HI> would undoubtedly give most certain Re∣lief, the contrary of which too often hap∣pens, <HI>viz.</HI> That after frequent or violent Purging, that Disease becomes worse. Nor can I agree with the Notion, that Cholick Pains proceed only from the <HI>Pancreatick juice</HI> mix'd with <HI>Choler,</HI> because it's impossible, according to <HI>Sylvius de la Boe</HI> that the Juice of the <HI>Pancreas in any manner or degree sowre,</HI> should mix with <HI>Choler,</HI> abounding with a <HI>bitter</HI> and <HI>volatile</HI> Salt. Therefore,</P>
<P>I firmly adhere to the Opinion of the Learned Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> who with great reason, places the Origine of this Disease among the effects of the <HI>Brain</HI> and the <HI>Genus Nervosum,</HI> alledging, that certain <HI>Recrements</HI> of the <HI>Nervous</HI> Humour, falling from the Brain by the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and passing thence into the <HI>Me∣sentry</HI> and other <HI>Foldings</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> are there amass'd and heaped together, which if they are so gross, thick and <HI>viscous,</HI> that they cannot be received and sent away by the <HI>Lymphaducts,</HI> or distill'd out into the Cavities of the <HI>Intestines,</HI> by the small Branches of the Vessels, then <HI>Stagnating</HI> and being heaped together by degrees into those
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>Parts, they arise at length to an <HI>irritative</HI> plenitude: And afterward that Matter becoming more degenerate, and more offen∣sive by <HI>Stagnation,</HI> and growing turged on some occasion; or of its own accord or else fermenting with the <HI>Salino-fix'd Humour,</HI> sent thither from the <HI>Blood,</HI> will torture the Patient with very troublesome and painful <HI>Corrugations</HI> in the Branches of the <HI>Nerves</HI> and Nervous <HI>Fibres,</HI> with which the <HI>Mesen∣tery</HI> is innumerably furnish'd: Which ef∣fects of them, do seldom or never cease till the <HI>fermenting Matter</HI> is either discuss'd, or <HI>express'd</HI> into the Cavities of the Intestines, or at length by Care and the Application of proper Medicines, they are utterly sub∣dued.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly shew'd you the <HI>Na∣ture</HI> of the <HI>Cholick</HI> in the direful effects it produces, together with its Origination, I shall, according to promise, proceed to the <HI>Place</HI> that is primarily affected in Human Bodies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The seat of the Cholick</NOTE><HI>Senertus</HI> and <HI>Riverius,</HI> place it in the up∣per Orifice of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> which is of ex∣quisite Sense, by reason of the intermixture of <HI>Nerves,</HI> with which it is stored from the <HI>vaga sexta,</HI> from whence Branches being communicated to the <HI>Heart</HI> that noble Part is also affected by Consent, and disperses the Pain into almost every part Internal and external.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Blankard,</HI> Professor of Physick, at <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> in <HI>Zealand,</HI> says, The Cholick is a vehement Pain, proceeding from an ill disposition of the <HI>Animal Spirits,</HI> seated in the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> but begins in the <HI>Nervous Plexus</HI>'s or <HI>Foldings</HI> of the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> and is
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>by some Men falsly imputed to have its residence in the Gut <HI>Colon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Michael Etmuller,</HI> late Professor of Physick in the University of <HI>Leiptsick,</HI> says, Cholick Pains and Gripings in the great Guts, are chiefly felt in the <HI>Colon,</HI> especially in that part of it towards the circumference of the Belly, upon the Left-side, where 'tis strait∣ned and incurvated, and consequently more liable to the blast and shocks of Wind, and more apt to stop the Circulation of the Excrements, and cause their Swelling up in∣to a hard or soft <HI>Tumor.</HI> This Pain and Tumor is frequently imputed to the <HI>Spleen,</HI> but erroneously; for the <HI>Colon,</HI> says he, is its usual and proper Seat; and sometimes it veers about to the Right-side of the Belly, upon the outermost Circumference, where the same <HI>Colon</HI> pursues its Course.</P>
<P>Sometimes these Pains reach only the Small Guts, and then their Station is about the <HI>Navel</HI> and Centre of the Belly, and are much more violent than those in the Great Guts; if they range not beyond the <HI>Duodenum,</HI> or the beginning of the <HI>Jejunum,</HI> they are felt in the <HI>Loins,</HI> and are often mi∣staken for <HI>Nephritick</HI> Pains, or those caused by the Convulsion of the <HI>Mesenterick</HI> Nerves, or Tumors, or Ulcers in the <HI>Pancreas.</HI> I dare not say any of these Opinions are He∣terodox, because sometime or other Pains do possess all the Parts above mention'd.</P>
<P>However, for very good Reasons grounded upon many Experiments in Anatomy, I ad∣here chiefly to Doctor <HI>Willis,</HI> who says, The Part in Human Bodies <HI>primarily</HI> affected in the Cholick, is the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> and its Ner∣vous <HI>Foldings</HI> under the Navel, which causes
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>cruel Pain, as if a Stake was stuck there, or a Piercer were making a Hole: Besides, round about, almost in the whole <HI>Abdomen,</HI> by reason of the <HI>Intestines</HI> being <HI>variously</HI> drawn forward and backward, at the same time in different Places, wandring Pains shoot this way and that way; and the mo∣tion of the <HI>Fibres</HI> being discomposed or in∣verted, as well in those Parts as in the <HI>pri∣mary</HI> Vessels, the Belly is in a manner al∣ways bound, and there follows sometimes a supperssion of Urine, or very little is made. Besides, the <HI>Duodenum</HI> the Gall Bladder with its Channels and the bottom of the Stomach being affected with a <HI>Cramp,</HI> and their <HI>Fibres</HI> being drawn upward, a frequent Vomiting with a copious casting up Matter of Yellow or Greenish colour often happens during the Fit.</P>
<P>In a Fit of the Cholick, also besides Pains of the Belly, there are likewise violent Pains of the <HI>Loins,</HI> raging in the 1ower parts of the <HI>Back,</HI> which certainly cannot pro∣ceed from the <HI>irritation of any Intestine;</HI> but its easy to conceive they may arise from a <HI>Morbific</HI> Cause lodg'd in the <HI>Mesentery:</HI> For inasmuch as several considerable <HI>Nerves</HI> of the Loins enter into the great <HI>Nervous fold∣ing</HI> of the <HI>Mesentery;</HI> so from hence, not on∣ly painful Convulsions are conveyed by <HI>con∣sent</HI> from one Part to another; but its also probable, that certain <HI>Recrements</HI> of the Back likewise, and of the Loins, are derived into the <HI>Mesentery</HI> by this Passage, and that in some sort, for this reason, <HI>Scorbutical</HI> Persons are so very obnoxious to Gripes of the Belly, and Looseness that attends it, which confirms me in the Opinion that the Nervous <HI>Flexus</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>of the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> is the first Part affected with the <HI>Cholick,</HI> and that its seat is not in the <HI>Cavities</HI> or <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nicles</HI> of the Intestines, nor the Morbifick Matter conveyed by the <HI>Arteries,</HI> but by <HI>Nerves.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diagno∣stick Sym∣ptoms.</NOTE><HI>Diagnostick</HI> Signs of the Cholick, are, very sharp Pains, sometimes moveable and other whiles fix'd to a certain place; some∣times the Pain is in the region of the <HI>Stomach</HI> or in the <HI>Reins,</HI> sometimes <HI>above</HI> and some∣times <HI>below</HI> the Navel, so that by the com∣parison of other Signs, you must distinguish between the <HI>Cholick</HI> and Pains of the <HI>Stone</HI> or <HI>Spleen,</HI> which are frequently mistaken one for the other, even by Physicians them∣selves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progno∣stick Sym∣ptoms of the Cholick.</NOTE><HI>Prognosticks</HI> of the Cholick, are vulgarly enough known, that is to say, an <HI>Accidental</HI> Cholick rising from an <HI>evident</HI> cause alone, is commonly safe, and admits of an easy Cure; but an <HI>habitual</HI> one, is not eradicated but with great Difficulty, as to its dispo∣sition, so that the Fits may return no more; for sometimes the <HI>Fits</HI> themselves, notwith∣standing the Application of Medicines, are very <HI>obstinate</HI> and continue many Days, nay, Weeks and Months, and sometimes are never cured but by Death. Thus much for signs; But since I have branch'd out this Disease into several Parts, I shall take leave, once for all, to shew, how you may distin∣guish one Disease from another by the Urine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Signs by the Urine.</NOTE>If the Urine is <HI>Watery,</HI> 'tis a <HI>Nephritick</HI> Cholick, if highly tinctur'd towards the middle, and colour'd on the Surface, and the <HI>Anus</HI> is obstinately bound; 'tis a <HI>Scor∣butick</HI> Cholick; if <HI>Respiration</HI> is difficult and
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>the <HI>Breast</HI> afflicted, 'tis a <HI>Hysterick</HI> Cholick; if the <HI>Convulsion</HI> of the <HI>Intestines</HI> is accom∣panied with Pain extending to the <HI>Pubes</HI> and <HI>Haunch-Bone,</HI> the <HI>Womb</HI> is disorder'd; if the Urine is clear and of a reddish <HI>Yellow,</HI> 'tis a <HI>Cholerick</HI> Cholick, if the Pain is tearing and the Urine <HI>Milky</HI> and Pale, impregnated with a large <HI>Sediment,</HI> the <HI>Mesenterick Nerves</HI> are affected.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of the com∣mon Cho∣lick.</NOTE>The <HI>Antecedent</HI> Causes of the <HI>Common</HI> Cho∣lick, which I only treat of under this Head, are, the Disorder and Convulsions of the <HI>Nerves</HI> running from the great <HI>Mesenterick Plexus,</HI> which cause tearing, wringing and contracting Pains: Sometimes occasion'd by <HI>Nephritick</HI> Pains and <HI>Child-Birth,</HI> when the <HI>Mesenterick</HI> folding, being irritated, by its concourse with the Nerves of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> and the <HI>Womb,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antece∣dent Cau-Causes.</NOTE> pulls and contracts both the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Guts</HI> which it supplies with Nerves. At other times they are re∣tainers to some fix'd, permanent, <HI>habitual</HI> Cause, which tho' it lye hid for some time, has always an Ascendant in the Body. These are either <HI>Hypochondriack, Hysterick</HI> or <HI>Scor∣butick,</HI> as I shall further shew, when I treat particularly of those Diseases a part, and are owing to the Convulsion of the <HI>Mesen∣terick Plexus,</HI> to which the Intestines are an∣nex'd, being gall'd with a peccant Acid.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Procatar∣tick Causes.</NOTE>The <HI>Procatartick,</HI> or Pre-existent Cause of this Disease which co-operates with others that are subsequent, are two fold; First, That many <HI>Recrements</HI> or superfluous things are heaped together in the Nervous Li∣quor; and Secondly, That they being ad∣mitted chiefly into the Nerves of the Viscera of the Belly, and so conveyed into the <HI>Me∣sentery,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>there create the Morbid Minera's of this Distemper; for the former of these generally happening by the Distemper of the Brain, by admitting <HI>Heterogeneous Particles</HI> with the Nervous Juice into its custody, the whole <HI>Animal</HI> Oeconomy is so disturb'd, that it cannot evacuate the common super∣fluities by its ordinary Conveyance; and this causes the incongruous Matter that can∣not be sent from the Brain, to force its pas∣sage into the Nerves of the <HI>Par vagum,</HI> which are open and ready to receive it. Se∣condly, That this superfluous Matter run∣ning in this manner into the <HI>Par vagum</HI> of the Nerves, is deposed in the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> or other foldings within the Abdomen, and necessarily makes the Morbid seat in the <HI>Mesentery.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Evident Causes.</NOTE>The <HI>evident</HI> Causes of the Cholick are also of two sorts; First, Such as being injurious to the Brain and <HI>Genus Nervosum,</HI> cause the Morbifick Matter to super abound: Or, Secondly by agitating the Blood and Hu∣mors, stir up the conglobated Mass to Pain, causing more fervent and sudden efferve∣scencies. And here some will imagine I should proceed to discourse the many and diversi∣fied occasions, by which the Pains of the Cholick are caus'd in Persons pre-disposed to them; but that would be nauseating the Reader with <HI>Cramben biscoctum,</HI> having suf∣ficiently done it already, in the Paragraph ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuled the direful effects of the Cholick, Page <HI>the</HI> 14th.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cure of the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lick.</NOTE>And now according to the Method I have prescribed to my self, I am brought to treat of what ought to be the Main and Principal design of every <HI>Practitioner</HI> in Physick in
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>all Diseases, <HI>viz. The Cure of the Disease.</HI> To compass which great end, Three primary In∣dications are suggested. First, To appease the <HI>Pains</HI> in the Fit. Secondly, To take a∣way the <HI>Cause</HI> of the Disease that the Fits may no more, or not so frequently return. Thirdly, To re-invigorate the Patient's <HI>Strength,</HI> and fortify his Constitution, in order to the Comfortable enjoyment of Life.</P>
<P>To appease the torturing Pains in the Paroxism, Lenifying and Emollient Glysters only, ought to be frequently injected into the Body, that the Corrugations of the <HI>Fi∣bres</HI> may be mitigated, and the raging of the <HI>Spirits</HI> appeased. To this end, <HI>Warm Milk with Sugar, or rather Molossus, or Syrup of Violets: Also Emollient Decoctions of March-Mallows, Herb Mercury, and the Flowers of Melilot with Oil of Almonds; also a strong Decoction of a Sheep's-Head with the Wool on it, or Calves-Feet, are proper to be used:</HI> Sometimes a Glyster of <HI>mear Oil of Olives or of Linseeds,</HI> have given Ease, when others have failed. But if this sort of Glysters are ineffectual and do not come away, or answer their end stronger must be used, to force the Humours from the little Mouths of the <HI>Arteries.</HI> For this purpose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et Carminative or bitter Decoctions be prep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red, in which dissolve <HI>Electuary Dia∣phoenic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Diacatholicon, or e Baccis Lauri, or Species Hierae,</HI> to which Liquors its customary to add, Two or Three Ounces of the infusion of <HI>Crocus Mettalorum:</HI> Or to a Pound of an <HI>Emollient Decoction,</HI> add of <HI>Venice Turpentine dissolv'd with the Yolk of an Egg, one Ounce;</HI> or take the <HI>Ʋrine</HI> of a Healthy Man, <HI>Venice Turpentine dissolv'd, one Ounce and half, and
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>with one Ounce of Molossus mix'd with the rest, make a Glyster.</HI> The <HI>Balsamick</HI> Particles of the <HI>Turpentine</HI> diffused every where, are de∣sign'd to remove the Morbifick or <HI>Stagnating</HI> Matter, or encline that which is <HI>Acetous,</HI> or otherwise degenerate, to a better Tem∣perament.</P>
<P>If the Intestines are much contracted by <HI>vicious</HI> Matter lodg'd within them, <HI>Purgations</HI> ought to be prohibited, for fear they <HI>promo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> the Contraction, and <HI>lock up</HI> the Excrements closer. If this Case happens in your Practice, <HI>Whey,</HI> or an Ounce of the <HI>Oil of Almonds, with Canary Wind and Sperma Caeti,</HI> are more effectual than the strongest <HI>Catharticks,</HI> If the Cholick is attended with a Tenacious <HI>viscid Humour,</HI> and a heavy boring Pain, Purgatives mix'd with <HI>attenuating</HI> Specificks are allowable; tho' I have observ'd, 'tis bet∣ter to do so after the Fit has made some progress, and the Symptoms are a little <HI>mit∣tigated,</HI> than just in the beginning, especially if the Pain is violent; but take notice, that if the Guts are <HI>inflamed,</HI> all <HI>Laxatives</HI> of what∣soever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind are extreamly pernicious; for a fierc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd very violent Cholick, if it pro∣ceed from an <HI>Inflamation</HI> or <HI>Abscess</HI> of some of the Intestines, generally ushers in a Mor∣tal <HI>Iliack Passion.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">External Applica∣tions.</NOTE>As for <HI>External</HI> Applications against Cho∣licks, let the Belly and Navel be well fo∣mented with <HI>Liniments,</HI> of express'd <HI>Oils,</HI> mix'd with those that are <HI>Distill'd.

<PB N="25" REF="24"/>or of <HI>Anodyn</HI> and <HI>Aromatic</HI> Ingre∣tlients; are like wise apply'd to the Belly with good success. But if the Gripes of the Belly do not remit by the use of these things, you must have recourse to <HI>Hypnoticks,</HI> which being given in a sitting Dose, often gives Relief. And in <HI>continued</HI> Cholicks notwith∣standing some Men, Whose <HI>Ignorance,</HI> is as considerable as their <HI>Insolence,</HI> loudly cla∣mour against the use of <HI>Mercurial</HI> Medi∣cines, yet the raising a gentle <HI>Salivation</HI> when the Morbifick Matter is plentifully gather'd together in the <HI>Nervous Plexus's,</HI> and other places about the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> and there sticking fast, so as not to be moved by other Medicines, <HI>Calomel</HI> may be given to the Relief of the Patient, and without Reproach to the Physician.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pre∣servative Indication.</NOTE>To refresh the Strength and falling Spi∣rits of the Sick, and to order yet a greater Apparatus against the Disease, give <HI>Liquid Laudanum tartariz'd, at Bed-time, in a Spoon∣ful of the Water of Camomil Flowers,</HI> drinking after it, of the same six Spoonfuls, and let it be repeated every other, or every third Night. And whilst you are using these Me∣dicines for appeasing Pains, let Purging Re∣medies have their due Turns, to destroy the <HI>Seminium</HI> of the Disease, and to prevent its return, <HI>Vomiting</HI> and <HI>Purging,</HI> and in a <HI>Hot</HI> Temperament <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebotomy</HI> ought to be used: And instead of <HI>Baths</HI> and <HI>Sudorificks, Diure∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icks</HI> may be more advantageously given.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How to be taken.</NOTE>This Water is to be taken by Two or Three Spoonfuls at any time, when the Sick is grieved with the Cholick; either by it self, or put into a Glass of warm Ale, or burnt White-Wine, and being <HI>repeated</HI> as occasion requires, the <HI>Physician</HI> will accom∣plish his main end, and the <HI>Patient</HI> if he is a Person of common Ingenuity, Gratitud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Honesty, will not grudge his Expenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Time or Money, in purchasing so effica∣cious Remedy.</P>
<P>The Third <HI>Nostrum</HI> I employ for the Cure of the Cholick, I call <HI>Pillulae Anticolicae,</HI> or <HI>Anticholical</HI> Pills; They are compounded of the choicest Ingredients in the whole <HI>Ma∣teria Medica,</HI> and require a long time and great Care and Pains in their Preparation, the <HI>Mass</HI> being an <HI>Extract</HI> and no common
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>Composition, as will appear in their <HI>Opera∣tion,</HI> and the happy <HI>effects</HI> produced by them. Now you having read in the foregoing Dis∣course, that in some Cases, and especially when the <HI>Intestines</HI> are much contracted by <HI>Viscous</HI> Matter contain'd in them, that <HI>Purg∣ing</HI> Medicines are not to be used; and that <HI>all other</HI> Cases, for the Cure of the Cholick, strong <HI>Catharticks</HI> are absolutely necessary; to avoid these extreams, I have chosen the <HI>Golden mean,</HI> and so contrived my <HI>Anticho∣lical Pills,</HI> by mixing attenuating and mol∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifying Ingredients with Purgatives, that they will Work but <HI>gently,</HI> tho' very <HI>ef∣fectually,</HI> in order to discuss or expel the <HI>Peccant</HI> Humours by degrees, without of∣fering <HI>Violence</HI> to Nature, by being over <HI>hasty</HI> in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cure, and to that end admini∣string over powerful Purgatives, which ra∣ther weaken the Patient, than mitigate his Pains, or diminish his Distemper. But <HI>my Pills</HI> are <HI>Hermetically</HI> compounded, and at the same time both throw out the sharp <HI>of∣fen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> Humours, corroborate the <HI>Stomach,</HI> fortify the <HI>Spirits,</HI> and strengthen the whole Body against the future Invasion of the Dis∣ease, as the only safe and easy way to a per∣fect Cure, which these Pills, taken accord∣ing to the following Directions, very seldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve behind them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Directions for taking the Pills.</NOTE>They are to be taken, one pill late at Night, at the time of going to Rest, every third or fourth Night, and if that Pill does not Work pretty early in the Morning, take one or two Pills more every two Hours till they Operate gently, but if it makes the Patient Sick in his Stomach, and doth not Purge him, let him Dissolve an
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>Ounce of <HI>Epsom</HI> Salt, or six Drams of the <HI>Le∣nitive Electuary,</HI> in a Pint of Water Gruel, or Mutton-Broath, and drink it Blood-warm, the Pills will have the same effect, if they are forced to be purg'd off; Two, Three, or Four Stools is sufficient for one time: Keep very warm, and drink nothing cold that Day. After taking them, let the Sick drink large draughts of thin <HI>Chicken</HI> Broath, <HI>Mutton</HI> Broath, or Water Gruel, or for want of them <HI>Posset Drink,</HI> to dilute the sharp Humours, cast them out, or their <HI>A∣crimony</HI> being taken off, reduce them to a better Temper: Which you will soon find, if this Course is duly repeated, as often as there is occasion, and when there is none, take no more Pills, for I don't give them for Lucre of <HI>Money,</HI> but to answer the In∣tention of <HI>Healing,</HI> for therein consists my Interest. These Pills are good for the Scurvy, Pains in any part of the Body, King's Evil, corrupt Humours in any Part of the Body, the Itch, Leprofie, Old Ulcers, Worms, Gravel, Stones and in other Cases where Purging is necessary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fourth Remedy.</NOTE>Those Days wherein the Patient does not Purge, I give a <HI>Cordial Electuary,</HI> which I call <HI>Electuarium Anticolica,</HI> or my <HI>Anticholical Electuary,</HI> which is the <HI>Fourth</HI> Remedy for the Cure of this Disease, and which seldom fails, if the Disease is Cureable, this <HI>Electuary</HI> being indued with such rare, uncommon and well experienc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Vertues,</HI> agreeable to the Dictates of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Art,</HI> and so signifi∣cantly adapted to the Cure of the <HI>Cholick,</HI> in all its various kinds, where purging is ne∣cessary or unnecessary and dangerous, that the Patient will seldom be perfectly cured with∣out
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>it; because as I have found by repeated Experience, that when all other Remedies prescribed by the best Hands have been in∣effectual, this <HI>Electuary</HI> has done the Work, by corroborating the Stomach, correcting its vicious Fermentation, retrieving its depraved Appetite, and restoring its almost lost <HI>Tone</HI> to a regular and sanative <HI>Crasis.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Directions for taking this Ele∣ctuary.</NOTE>This <HI>Electuary</HI> is sometimes also to be taken in the Morning on an empty Sto∣mach: Its <HI>Dose</HI> is about the quantity of a <HI>Nutmeg,</HI> fasting an Hour after it, and again at Four or Five in the Afternoon, for 10, 15, 20, or 30 Days, when you use no Purgatives. Eat what Dyet is most <HI>nourishing</HI> and sits <HI>light</HI> upon the Stomach, and abstain from nothing so much as <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Stale</HI> Beer. And now I might be Very Copious, in the Commendation and Praise of these <HI>Four Re∣medies,</HI> invented by, and I believe only known to my <HI>self,</HI> and are disposed of at no Place, but my Dwelling-House; but that Persons who know me not, may not think I <HI>harangue</HI> to promote my own <HI>Profit</HI> in selling them, I shall wave it for the present, and leave every Man that buys and uses them, to give them what Character they Deserve. For when I have said all I can, <HI>Wise Men</HI> will not regard what is <HI>said</HI> of them, but what <HI>Cures</HI> have been, and may be accom∣plish'd by them. And from hence I pro∣ceed to Observations, and <HI>Examples</HI> of Per∣sons cured of the Cholick, by the regular use of my afore named Remedies of which its needless to give you great Numbers, tho' I am plentifully furnish'd with them; because the Publick bas almost Weekly notice of Persons cured by me in

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cholick in the Sto∣mach.</NOTE>Having now finish'd what I had to say of an <HI>Accidental</HI> Cholick, according to the Me∣thod proposed, I am obliged to treat of the Cholick as <HI>complicated</HI> or joined with other Diseases, and that which leads the Van, is the <HI>Stomachical Chotick,</HI> and that very justly, because the <HI>Minera</HI> of all Chronical Dis∣eases are to be sought in the Stomach: And if the upper <HI>Orifice</HI> of it, which is of <HI>exquisite</HI> Sense, by reason of the intermixture of <HI>Nerves,</HI> with which it is plentifully furnish'd from the <HI>vaga sexta,</HI> Branches whereof being communicated to the <HI>Heart,</HI> that noble part being affected, then the Disease is called in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> vel <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and in Latin <HI>Cardiacus dolor, the Pain of the Heart;</HI> but if the lower Orifice called <HI>Pylorus</HI> be affected, it is called <HI>Dolor, seu Colica Ventriculi, Pain, or the Cholick in the Stomach,</HI> more especially if it proceed from <HI>Wind.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of the Cholick in the Sto∣mach.</NOTE>The <HI>Internal</HI> Causes of this Disease, some∣times proceed from great <HI>Oppletion</HI> and Pain of the Stomach, sometimes from frequent and violent <HI>Vomiting,</HI> which arises from the <HI>Chyle</HI> there degenerated into a Mass of Cor∣ruption; but oftner from the Morbifick Matter brought thither, either by the con∣veyance of the <HI>Blood,</HI> or also of the <HI>Nervous Juice,</HI> and either deposed within the <HI>Cavity</HI> of the Stomach, or fix'd in the <HI>Plexus</HI>'s of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and in the <HI>Membranes</HI> appertaining to it.

<P>The <HI>External</HI> Causes of this Malady, may be corrupt Nourishment, Viands too Hot that breed Wind or Choler: <HI>Meat</HI> taken in too large quantity, <HI>Poyson,</HI> or strong sharp and dangerous Medicines <HI>uncorrected.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Symptoms of the Cho∣lick in the Stomach.</NOTE><HI>Diagnostick</HI> Signs, are, Pain in the <HI>Ensi∣formis,</HI> or lower part of the Breast-Bone, which signifie that the <HI>upper Orifice</HI> of the Stomach is affected with very sharp Pain, that will not suffer the Patient to take any <HI>Rest,</HI> and sometimes cause an inveterate <HI>Headach,</HI> the <HI>Megrim, Vertigo</HI> and the <HI>Epi∣lepsy.</HI> In the other Parts of the Stomach the Symptoms are not so violent, but are truly <HI>Cholical,</HI> and exactly resemble that Disease in its utmost Latitude.</P>
<P><HI>Prognostick</HI> Symptoms are ominous, for this Disease is more <HI>danger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> than any other Dis∣ease of the Stomach, and the Danger is <HI>greater</HI> if it is accompanied with a <HI>Fever,</HI> for in such a case, according to <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> Death is at hand.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cure of a Cholick in the Sto∣mach.</NOTE>The method of Curing a <HI>Stomachical Cho∣lick,</HI> if it be not grown <HI>Obstinate, Inveterate,</HI> and beyond the <HI>Power</HI> of Medicines to give Relief, is by considering the <HI>Cause</HI> of the Disease, to prescribe Medicines that are pro∣per to remove it.</P>
<P>If <HI>Wind</HI> is the Cause, <HI>Carminative</HI> Clysters are exhibited, to discuss it and moderate the <HI>violent</HI> Pains in the Stomach caused by it: And if the <HI>Wind</HI> be accompanied with flush∣ings in the Face and excessive Heat, <HI>Spirit of Nitre dulcisied with Spirit of Wine, and impreg∣nated with the Vertue of Carminative Simples after</HI> Sylvius<HI>'s Method,</HI> is said to be an incomparable Remedy. Inveterate <HI>acid</HI> Belchings are put off, <HI>by five or six Pepper Corns being taken every Morning Fasting.</HI> If the Wind proceed from a thick, stubborn <HI>Mucilage, Asthmatical Syrups, and</HI> Michael<HI>'s Elixir for the Stomach</HI> are very proper; to which you may add Externally, <HI>Fomentations with Oil of Chamomel, and of the Carminative Seeds: Or with a mixture of Ani∣seed-Water, Spirit of Wine Camphorated and Treacle.</HI></P>
<P>If a <HI>Viscous</HI> stinking, or otherwise offen∣sive matter be cast up by <HI>Vomit,</HI> and there be <HI>suspicion</HI> that the Cause lies in the <HI>Cavity</HI> of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> 'tis proper to give <HI>a gentle Vomit, of Wine of Squills, or of Salt of Vitriol;</HI> or the offending Humours may be purg'd off by Stool, by <HI>Stomachical</HI> Catharticks adapted <HI>pro re nata.</HI> But if the Matter sticks deeply and firmly within the <HI>Membranes,</HI> or foldings of the Nerves, <HI>Diaphoreticks or Specificks that
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>moderate the effervescencies of the Salts</HI> are more prevalent, and ought to be administred at proper times, as the Physician employ'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall find occasion: Not forgetting, twice or thrice a Day to apply <HI>Fomentations</HI> to the Region of the Stomach, with Woolen Cloths dipt in the warm'd Liquid Medicine last above named, and wrung forth; for that will much contribute to the abatement of the Patient's griping, intolerable Pains.</P>
<P>In the next place it will be expected that here I should say something of a <HI>Stomachical Cholick</HI> caused by <HI>Worms</HI> gnawing the <HI>Tunicles</HI> of the Stomach, but I shall wholly omit it at present; because the next <HI>Physical</HI> Discourse I shall publish, shall be a <HI>Treatise of the Worms,</HI> which I am now preparing for the <HI>Press.</HI> In the mean time, if any Person, <HI>Young</HI> or <HI>Old,</HI> that is troubled with them, and desires to be rid of those <HI>Vexations</HI> and dangerous <HI>Inmates,</HI> that render Life so uneasy, if he please to come or send to me, he may be supplied with <HI>Antivermetick</HI> Medicines of my own preparing, that will effectually <HI>Eject</HI> those <HI>vile</HI> Inhabitants, under every denomina∣tion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Au∣thor's own Medicines.</NOTE>But to return from this Digression, the Method I have shewn in the general practice of Physick, by the best Physicians of the present Age, in the foregoing Paragraphs, is what I observe my self, tho' the Medicines I give are entirely of my own <HI>Inventing, Compounding</HI> and <HI>Preparing,</HI> and the <HI>Effi∣cacy</HI> whereof I can rely upon for a Cure, (if curable) of this dangerous Disease; for tho' in all <HI>Cholical</HI> Distempers my <HI>Elixir, Cho∣lick-Water, Pills and Electuary,</HI> will have their Turns, yet am I not unprovided of <HI>other</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>Medicines to assist effectually in the Cure, When the Cholick is <HI>complicated</HI> with other Diseases, and consequently indigitates the use of others, as the Cholick <HI>varies</HI> in its <HI>Name, Cause</HI> and <HI>Parts affected.</HI></P>
<P>For these Reasons and because in <HI>Sto∣machical Cholicks,</HI> proceeding from Viscous stinking Matter lodg'd in the Cavity of the Stomach, a Vomit seems absolutely neces∣sary, to dislodge the offending Humour; I am always provided of an <HI>Emetick</HI> of such an universal Vertue, that it answers all the <HI>Intentions of Nature and Art</HI> in Vomiting, and leaves no <HI>Relicks</HI> for another Invasion behind it. Which Medicine will never lose its Ver∣tue, and consequently may be sent to the remotest parts of the <HI>Ʋniverse,</HI> and private <HI>Families</HI> may keep it by them to use when they have occasion.</P>
<P>Where the corrupted Matter in a <HI>Stomachi∣cal Cholick</HI> sticks firm and deep within the <HI>Membranes</HI> or Foldings of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and indigitates the use of <HI>Diaphoreticks,</HI> or such Medicines as moderate the effervescencies of the <HI>Salts:</HI> For those purposes I have a <HI>Mi∣neral</HI> Remedy, which I exhibit sometimes in <HI>Powder,</HI> other whiles in the form of an <HI>Electuary,</HI> and at other times in a <HI>Decoction</HI> or Syrup, as they best agree with the Pa∣tient's <HI>Palate,</HI> which works almost miracu∣lously in this Disease, and so cleanse, purify and strengthen the Stomach, and assist it in the Work of <HI>Fermentation,</HI> that it expels all noxious humours whatever, and retains what conduces to a <HI>vigorous</HI> constitution and a <HI>durable</HI> state of Health.</P>
<P>These great things I am sensible my nu∣merous Enemies, which are chiefly Persons
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>of my own <HI>Profession,</HI> or such unthinking People as are <HI>prejudiced</HI> by their malicious false stories, will call idle, vain <HI>Bosting,</HI> but those that have experienced and <HI>tried</HI> my Medicines, will do m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> justice in a mo∣dester and juster Character, and esteem my Remedies as <HI>Non-Pareils.</HI></P>

<P>Tho' the <HI>Hysterical Cholick</HI> often rises from the <HI>Brain,</HI> yet sometimes it comes by a Cause <HI>beginning</HI> either in the <HI>Womb,</HI> or in other parts or the <HI>Viscera,</HI> and in whatever part it seats it self, it presently produces such Symptoms as <HI>belong to it,</HI> and unless the Phy∣sician is very Skilful, he will be mistaken, and think those Symptoms come from some <HI>Essential</HI> Distemper of this or that Part, and not from an <HI>Hysterick</HI> Cholick; therefore the Symptoms are best taken from the Part af∣fected.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progno∣stick Sym∣ptoms.</NOTE>If the <HI>Female</HI> Patient, is extraordinarily troubled with <HI>Cholick</HI> griping Pains and <HI>in∣cessant</HI> Vomitings, joined with strong <HI>Con∣vulsive</HI> Fits, her <HI>Menses</HI> stopt, undergoing violent Contractions and Convulsions, about the parts of the <HI>Mouth,</HI> and <HI>Face,</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> and <HI>Legs,</HI> with a <HI>Pale,</HI> Wan Countenance and <HI>trembling</HI> as she walks, and growing every Day worse than other, her <HI>Case</HI> is very <HI>Dangerous</HI> and seldom or never admits of Cure: But if the Convulsions <HI>cease,</HI> by administring proper Medicines, adapted to <HI>Cholick</HI> Pains and <HI>Fits of the Mother</HI> in Con∣junction; <HI>Vapours</HI> ascending from the Womb are expell'd, and the <HI>Menses</HI> orderly flow, they are hopeful Indications.</P>
<P>The <HI>Procatartick</HI> or External Causes of this <HI>complicated</HI> Disease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of an Hyste∣rical Cho∣lick.</NOTE> are violent <HI>motions</HI> of the Body, or which is oftner and worse, violent <HI>Perturbations</HI> of the Mind from some sudden assault, either of <HI>Anger</HI> or <HI>Grief,</HI> or such like Passions, especially as I have said already, if <HI>Ʋrine</HI> clear as <HI>Christal</HI> evacuated <HI>copiousl</HI> at some certain times, makes the <HI>Diagnostick</HI> more manifest. But to these <HI>Disorders</HI> of the Mind, which are usually the Cause of this Disease, <HI>Emptiness</HI> of the Sto∣mach by reason of long <HI>Fasting,</HI> is to be added, and immoderate <HI>Bleeding,</HI> a <HI>Vomit</HI> or <HI>Purge</HI> that has wrought too much. Now having drawn the Picture of this Disease, ac∣cording to its vulgar <HI>Phenomena;</HI> in the next place, the <HI>Internal,</HI> Efficient Causes are to be considered, as well as I can gather them from all the Circumstances joined together: And in my Opinion this Disease that I call
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>an <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sterical Cholick,</HI> proceeds from a stoppage of the <HI>Menses,</HI> a <HI>confusion</HI> of the Animal Spirits, when too many of them, and contrary to due proportion are violent∣ly burried upon this or that part, causing Convulsions and Pains, when they rush up∣on Parts of Exquisite Sense; to which the causes of a <HI>Simple</HI> Cholick being added, you have the true Causes of this Disease.</P>
<P>The general method for the Cure of this Disease, is, first to give present Ease in the <HI>Paroxisms,</HI> and then proceed to a Cure. To accomplish both these <HI>Intentions,</HI> 'tis usual in the first place to apply stinking and strong smelling things to the Nostrils, the <HI>Effluvia</HI>'s of which, repress and reduce to order the Spirits which are grown too <HI>Wild,</HI> and apt to make <HI>exorbitant</HI> efforts; nay, and discuss their <HI>Heterogeneous</HI> combination, and often wholly exterminate it. <HI>Assa Faetida, Casto∣reum, Galbanum,</HI> tyed in a fine Cloth and held to the Nostrils are proper; also <HI>Par∣tridges</HI> Feathers, or old <HI>Shoes</HI> burnt, or <HI>Sul∣phur</HI> kindled; also the <HI>Spirit and Oil of Soot and Harts-horn</HI> often give Ease; but the chief Indication in this Disease, is to <HI>strengthen</HI> the Blood which is the fountain of the Spirits; which being done, the invigorated Spirits can preserve that order which is agreeable to the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of the whole Body, and the particular Parts. And therefore when the <HI>Ataxy</HI> of the Spirits has vitiated the Hu∣mours by long continuance, you must first <HI>lessen</HI> the Humours so corrupted, by <HI>bleeding</HI> and <HI>Purging</HI> if the Patient has sufficient strength, before you endeavour to invigo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate the Blood; and which indeed you can
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>scarce do, whilst a <HI>faeculent</HI> heap of Humours lye in the way.</P>
<P>If there be room for a <HI>Vomit,</HI> you must always begin with that, especially in <HI>Caco∣ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mical</HI> Persons in whom a mighty load of <HI>Viscous</HI> Phlegm sticking to the Folds and Coats of the Stomach, hinders the Vertues of other Medicines. In a few Days after the Vomit, unless somewhat indicates the contrary; in Women of a <HI>Hot</HI> Tempera∣ment open a Vein in the Arm presently, or afterward if need be take Blood from the Foot, or the Fundament by <HI>Leeches,</HI> and after these Evacuations duly performed: <HI>always provided they be indicated,</HI> let a Purge be given three or four Mornings after. Then to <HI>strengthen</HI> the Blood, and consequently support the Spirits, let <HI>Chalybeates</HI> be ex∣hibited to raise a Volatile <HI>Ferment</HI> in the Va∣pid and Languid Blood, that the <HI>Spirits</HI> may be roused, which before were press'd down by their own Weight. These Di∣rections I think sufficient, without prescri∣bing particular Medicines or their Doses, for he that does not understand what Me∣dicines are proper, in every Disease, the quantity to be given, and the manner <HI>How,</HI> and the time <HI>When,</HI> is unfit to practise Phy∣sick; and for those who do not pretend to that Skill, they may have <HI>experimented</HI> Me∣dicines of me in most Diseases, if they ei∣ther please to come themselves, or send their Cases in <HI>Writing,</HI> or by an <HI>Intelligent</HI> Messenger.</P>

<P>Now because the <HI>Scurvy</HI> is a lurking Dis∣ease, and consumes the Patient by insensible or slow degrees, and its direful effects are never so much perceived or felt, as when it intermixes it self with other Diseases, so its seldom regarded as the principal Offender, but the the Disease is chiefly attributed to the Concommitant Distemper that causes Pain. So it often happens, that a continued latent <HI>Scurvy</HI> is little observed, but when its joined with the Cholick that causes griping tormenting Pains, the Disease is called a <HI>Cholick,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>and Remedies used accordingly without Suc∣cess, because the <HI>Scurvy</HI> was neglected, tho' scarce any effect requires a more speedy <HI>Physical</HI> help, than the <HI>Cholick</HI> and Gripes of the Besly occasion'd by the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> which makes them more violent, and of longer continuance, by obstinately resisting the Methods of Cure.</P>
<P>In the Symptoms of the <HI>Scorbutick Cholick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Symptoms of the Scorbutick Cholick.</NOTE> I shall be very brief, having been very large on that Head in the foregoing Cholicks.</P>
<P>The usual Signs are, high colour'd Urine or precipitating a Red Sandy Flesh colour'd Sediment, or fastens red friable Sand upon the sides of the Urinal. Continual Pain of the <HI>Head, Palpitation</HI> of the Heart, <HI>puffing</HI> up of the Stomach, <HI>loathing,</HI> Vomiting, Belching, Hiccough, Cough, Tumors and <HI>Putrefaction</HI> of the <HI>Gums</HI> with much Spitting; Looseness and <HI>blackness</HI> of the Teeth, (for the Cure of which I have a Dentefrice which makes the Teeth as White as Ivory,) the <HI>Breath</HI> stinks, and is sometimes fetch'd with great <HI>difficulty,</HI> and is seldom free from terrible Pains of the <HI>Cholick,</HI> and trembling and looseness of the <HI>Joints</HI> and Limbs, with <HI>Laziness</HI> and often <HI>Faint Sweats;</HI> there is also sometimes Malignant <HI>Ʋlcers,</HI> dry hard <HI>Tubercles, Erisipelas,</HI> and <HI>Oedematous</HI> Tumors, with many others, which to enumerate, were to comprehend an universal Genus of <HI>Atoms</HI> within a very narrow Limitation.</P>
<P>This Disease is very <HI>hard</HI> to cure, where the Scorbutick Humour is obdurate and <HI>pre∣dominant,</HI> and when the Cure has been too long <HI>delayed,</HI> or not treated as a <HI>complicated</HI> Disease, many times 'tis very <HI>Dangerous,</HI> the Pains of the <HI>Cholick</HI> may run into an incurable

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of a Scorbu∣tick Cho∣lick.</NOTE>The <HI>Immediate causes</HI> of this Disease, is, a volatile <HI>Acid,</HI> that irritates the <HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Membranes,</HI> sharpens the <HI>Lympha,</HI> debauches the innate <HI>Spirits</HI> of the Parts, and perverts the <HI>equal</HI> temperature of the Blood. The <HI>Remote Causes,</HI> are, <HI>Sea Air</HI> impregnated with <HI>Salin,</HI> Acid Vapours, <HI>Salt</HI> and Viscous Food, <HI>Laziness,</HI> Weakness of <HI>Digestion,</HI> Infection, a <HI>Hereditary</HI> Conveyance, and the <HI>influence</HI> of Chronical Diseases. If the Disease is <HI>recent</HI> it admits of Cure. If <HI>inveterate,</HI> it requires a continued use of proper Medicines for a long space of time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cure of a Scorbutick Cholick.</NOTE>The Cure of a <HI>Scorbutick Cholick,</HI> consists, in correcting and evacuating the <HI>Crudities</HI> of the first Passages, fortifying the <HI>Stomach,</HI> re∣trieving the due <HI>Crasis</HI> of the Blood, restoring all wonted <HI>Evacuations</HI> to their former Course, and to appease excruciating Pains. In order then to compass these Ends, and Cure this stubborn and rebellious Disease, the Sick must observe a good <HI>Diet,</HI> without which Physical means will profit but little: And here, because in the first place there will be a necessity (if possible) to give <HI>Ease</HI> in the Fit by <HI>Opiates,</HI> let them always be ac∣companied by <HI>Antiscorbutick Specificks,</HI> of which may be prepared diversity of good Medicines, both <HI>Chymical</HI> and <HI>Galenical.</HI> The <HI>Volatile Salts</HI> both of Animals and Vegitables are excellent to open all Obstructions, and Temper the Humours; also, <HI>Elixir Proprie∣tatis,</HI> the Spirit of <HI>Sal Armoniack,</HI> the Spirit
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>of <HI>Nitre,</HI> and of <HI>Salt</HI> Dulcified, <HI>Salt of Steel, Wormwood</HI> and <HI>Tartar, Oil of Juniper, Cloves</HI> and <HI>Cinamon,</HI> are all Antiscorbutick Spe∣cificks.</P>
<P>Next in order are gentle <HI>Laxitives,</HI> espe∣cially in Hot Constitutions; such are Pills of <HI>Armoniacum,</HI> or those of <HI>Tartar</HI> mix'd with sweet <HI>Mercury,</HI> to prevent or take a∣way Costiveness. <HI>Resinous</HI> Purgatives are to be avoided, as beings endow'd with an <HI>A∣stringent</HI> Quality. <HI>Raisins, Prunes, Tamarinds,</HI> and Ripe sweet <HI>Apples,</HI> or their express'd <HI>Juice</HI> are of considerable Efficacy in this Case; but <HI>Sugar</HI> and other sweet things ought to be carefully avoided. <HI>Rhubarb</HI> or <HI>Cream of Tartar,</HI> sharpened with Pouder of <HI>Jalap,</HI> are proper for such as are of a <HI>Moist</HI> Juicy Con∣stitution.</P>
<P>The Patient's Body being thus prepared, you ought to proceed to <HI>Alteratives,</HI> such are <HI>Steel</HI> and all fix'd <HI>Salts,</HI> or whatever subdues an <HI>Acid.</HI> To which join <HI>Aperient, Diureticks</HI> and <HI>bitter</HI> Stomachical <HI>Aromaticks,</HI> or the Spirituous Volatile <HI>Salts, Mynsichts Arcanūm Duplicatum,</HI> is of excellent use, especially when the Sick is troubled with <HI>Flushings</HI> and sudden Inflamations. <HI>Elixir Proprietatis</HI> pre∣pared with an <HI>Acid</HI> and mix'd with the Spi∣rit of <HI>Scurvigrass,</HI> and that of <HI>Sal Armoniac</HI> is also proper. The Tincture of <HI>Tartar</HI> mix'd with the Spirit of <HI>Sal-Armoniack,</HI> and given by degrees to Forty Drops, is a celebrated Medicine. And as you find occasion, Fo∣mentations, Ligatures, Ventoses, Sternuta∣tories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are of use.</P>
<P>I have been long you see in discoursing the Cure of the <HI>Scorbutick Cholick,</HI> according to the general Method of Practice, because its
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>a stubborn Disease, and too often of <HI>long</HI> continuance: Occasion'd by this Disease, being, as it were, an odd and <HI>new</HI> kind of Distemper, not reducible to the old <HI>Class</HI> of Cholicks. Secondly being not consider'd in its various <HI>Mixtures, Complications</HI> and <HI>Dis∣guises,</HI> which requires other sorts of Medi∣cines to cure it, than are commonly pre∣scribed. Thirdly by Practioners being con∣founded by variety of Medicines directed by Authors, who seeing one Medicine <HI>fail,</HI> run to another, and so from Medicine to Medicine in an endless Circuit, till they have either destroy'd or nauseated their Pa∣tients, as well as cram'd their <HI>Chamber</HI>-Windows and <HI>Tables,</HI> with Galipots, Glasses, Boxes and Papers, whose Contents, instead of expelling noxious Humours, had no other effect than draining the Patient's <HI>Purse</HI> to enrich an unexperienc'd, unskilfull Phy∣sician.</P>

<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of the Iliack Passion.</NOTE>The Cause of an <HI>Ileos,</HI> or <HI>Iliaca Passio,</HI> is a excrementitious <HI>Viscous</HI> Matter, adhering to the Gut <HI>Ileo,</HI> which in time is coagulated into a very hard substance, almost in the Form of <HI>Bullets,</HI> whence all the <HI>passage</HI> for Excrements by siege is stop'd, and anon their <HI>regress</HI> and <HI>ascent</HI> to the Stomach fol∣lows, with a miserable Vomiting of them up.</P>
<P>The Rupture of the <HI>Peritoneum</HI> may cause this grievous Disease, especially if it be so great, that not only the small Guts but the great ones also, fall through the <HI>lacerated</HI> Orifice, and renders them uncapable of be∣ing <HI>reduced</HI> or put back through the same <HI>Hole;</HI> so that a hard and unsupportable <HI>Tu∣mor</HI> follows, which hinders the <HI>Reflux</HI> of Blood, and causes an <HI>Inflamation,</HI> and con∣sequently a <HI>Gangrene</HI> in the Guts, attended with a violent Vomiting of the Excrements and a speedy summons to the Grave.</P>
<P>But we may chiefly assign a twofold Cause of this <HI>Inversion,</HI> from whence the Pain arises, and they are <HI>Obstruction</HI> and <HI>Irritation;</HI> for whatever violently obstructs the <HI>Intestines,</HI> so that nothing can pass <HI>downwards,</HI> necessa∣rily occasions this <HI>contrary</HI> Motion in them, as hardned Excrements, gross Wind col∣lected in great quantity, <HI>&amp;c. Irritation</HI> pro∣ceeds from sharp and <HI>Malignant</HI> Humours cast upon the Stomach and Guts that are next to it, by the excessive raging of the Blood, by reason of a late <HI>Fever</HI> begun, whereby the <HI>motion</HI> of the Stomach is first <HI>Inverted,</HI> and violently forced to cast up what is contained in it; at length the small Guts that are joined to the Stomach being weakned, yield to the <HI>violent</HI> Motion of it,
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>and with them at last the <HI>greater</HI> follow by consent; the Stomach Vomiting beginning the fatal Tragedy: And this may be truly call'd the <HI>Iliack</HI> Passion.</P>
<P>The cure of this Disease, consists in re∣moving the <HI>Irritation,</HI> and retrieving the <HI>Natural</HI> Motion of the Guts, to that end if the Excrements are harden'd they ought to be soften'd by the speedy exhibition of <HI>Clysters,</HI> before they are hardened beyond Re∣lief. All Purgatives are improper, till the Pain in the <HI>Guts</HI> and <HI>Stomach</HI> are quieted, and restored to their Natural Motion, which you may know, by a large quantity of Hu∣mours being voided <HI>downwards</HI> by the help of <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Art. Opiates</HI> are very hurtful in case of a <HI>Gangrene</HI> and in that of <HI>Obstructions,</HI> till the Belly is well opened; but if the Dis∣ease proceed from violent <HI>Irritations,</HI> attend∣ed by continual <HI>vomiting, Opiates</HI> may be mix'd with <HI>Stomachical</HI> Medicines while the Patient is strong: Always remembring, that what∣ever you use in the Cure of this Disease, whether <HI>outwardly</HI> or <HI>inwardly,</HI> must be <HI>Warm,</HI> both in the Fit, and when the Patient is on the mending hand.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Small Guts</HI> only are inverted, give Emollient Clysters, quickned with <HI>Sal Gem,</HI> or the Infusion of <HI>Crocus Metallorum,</HI> or those of the <HI>Carminative Seeds</HI> boiled in Childs Urine and Water: But if the <HI>great</HI> ones are also Inverted, that sort of Clysters are <HI>noxious,</HI> and you must seek help from <HI>tem∣perate,</HI> Laxative, lubrical Potions; such as the Decoction of <HI>Emollient</HI> Herbs in Broath, mix'd with <HI>Oil</HI> of <HI>Sweet Almonds</HI> newly drawn.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
<P>When all other Medicines want Success, some Men give <HI>Leaden Bullets,</HI> and boast of the use of <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> which I have seldom known to have done much good, but often prove injurious, especially in an <HI>Inflamation, Rupture, Gangrene,</HI> or <HI>falling of the upper Gut into the lower;</HI> therefore if any Practitioner thinks himself under a necessity of using <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> which is prefered before <HI>Bullets,</HI> let him be sure to prepare his Patient's Body before he gives it, with <HI>lubric al</HI> Medi∣cines, such as <HI>Oil</HI> of <HI>Sweet Almonds</HI> new drawn, or <HI>Sperma Caeti:</HI> Then exhibit Three, Four, and sometimes Eight <HI>Ounces</HI> of purified <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> together with Oil of <HI>Sweet Al∣monds</HI> and <HI>Mint Water;</HI> and if it does not answer his Intentions at first, let it be fre∣quently repeated, and the mean while inject Emollient Clysters, foment the Belly with <HI>softning</HI> Decoctions; or set the Sick into a pro∣per <HI>Bath.</HI> If the <HI>Mercury</HI> does not force its way out of the Body, give sharp <HI>Clysters,</HI> and anoint the Belly with Oil of <HI>Coloquintida</HI> to soften the Excrements. If the <HI>Quicksilver</HI> offend the Mouth, Throat and Gums, check its <HI>virulence</HI> with a Gargarism of <HI>Honey of Roses,</HI> and <HI>Syrup of Violets;</HI> and if the <HI>Mercury</HI> is successful in opening the Body, remember to exhibit the <HI>Lunar Bezoar</HI> and <HI>Diaphoretick Antimony,</HI> to expel the remains of the <HI>Mer∣cury;</HI> for tho' <HI>Mercury</HI> given by an <HI>Intelligent</HI> Person is an <HI>Excellent</HI> Medicine, yet it always does <HI>Mischief,</HI> if any of it stays too long in the Body.</P>
<P>These are the usual Methods for disco∣vering the Cause and curing this Disease, which I publish in this succinct way; First, to assist those that want greater <HI>Light;</HI> Se∣condly
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>to shew, that I am thoroughly in∣structed in the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of Physick; and, Thirdly, to <HI>silence</HI> Malicious <HI>Back-biters,</HI> who for want of <HI>business,</HI> make it part of their employment, to represent me in their ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Class of <HI>Ignoramus</HI>'s which this <HI>Treatise,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the rest that are to follow it, will plainly <HI>confute,</HI> in the Opinion of all Men of Sense, Generosity and Learning.</P>
<P>In my own Practice for the Cure of this Disease, when it evidently appears by the Symptoms above-named, and by Vomiting up <HI>Clysters,</HI> that its a true <HI>Iliack Passion,</HI> I apply my self to give the Patient some Ease, if it be possible; for let others say what they please, he that can do that has half <HI>conquer'd</HI> the Disease, for then Nature will assist in removing the Cause, by being <HI>enabled</HI> to sustain the <HI>Force</HI> of Medicines proper to soften the Excrements, and after to expel them by Siege: And to this end, I give my <HI>Elixir</HI> in small Doses, repeat them often, and enlarge the number of Drops every time they are given, and I never found them unsuccessful; their Vertue being to <HI>invigorate</HI> the Sick by giving him a relaxation from his Pain, Mollifying the offending Matter, and by that means preparing and smoothing the way for my <HI>Pills to drive it out</HI> by gentle degrees; for this Disease will endure no rough and violent Treatment.</P>
<P>Here I cannot, according to Custom, give <HI>Examples</HI> of Persons Cured by the use of my <HI>Two above-named Remedies;</HI> (one I cured some∣time since, but am not permitted to make use of her Name,) for tho', blessed be God, I have never <HI>wanted</HI> Success, yet I could

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cae∣liack Cho∣lick.</NOTE>Called in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in Latin <HI>Caeliaca Passio,</HI> the <HI>Caeliack Passion,</HI> or <HI>Caeliack Cholick,</HI> is a <HI>Looseness</HI> of the Belly, when the Meat comes forth <HI>crude</HI> and imperfectly digested; which some say is not to be refered to the <HI>Concoction</HI> only being hurt, but to the debility of the <HI>Retentive</HI> Faculty, the Food being not long enough <HI>retained</HI> to be Concocted; by which it appears, say they, that the Disease proceeds from a <HI>fault</HI> in the Stomach as well as in the <HI>Guts:</HI> But the Learned <HI>Etmullerus,</HI> says, it is a <HI>Flux</HI> of the <HI>Belly,</HI> by which the <HI>Chyle</HI> is voided together with Excrements, the Stomach being in <HI>no fault,</HI> because <HI>Chy∣lification</HI> is duly perform'd there; therefore the blame, says he, must either be laid on the <HI>Bile,</HI> that is stopt in its Passage to the Guts, or by degenerating from its <HI>Saline</HI> Acrimony, and consequently is unfit to se∣perate the <HI>Chyle:</HI> Or else on the <HI>Lacteal</HI> Vessels through which the <HI>Chyle</HI> ought to pass, their <HI>Orifices</HI> being covered With <HI>Slime,</HI> or shut by the <HI>Contraction,</HI> or <HI>Corrosion</HI> of the Intestines occasion'd by <HI>Fluxes.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Symptoms of a Cae∣liaca.</NOTE>The <HI>Symptoms</HI> of this Disease, are, extra∣or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inary, Pains both in the upper and lower <HI>Region</HI> of the Belly, not unattended with Pain in the Back and Limbs; for all compli∣cated Diseases, generally affect all the Neigh∣bouring Parts, as well as the Place where they are more particularly and chiefly seat∣ed;
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>and that you may have a true notion of this Maladay, observe, that if the <HI>Bile</HI> is defective, the Excrements are <HI>White,</HI> or very <HI>Pale;</HI> without any sign of separation. If the obstruction of the <HI>Lacteal</HI> Veins cause the Disease, the Excrements are <HI>Yellowish,</HI> and the <HI>Chyle,</HI> tho' voided at the same time with them, is but <HI>loosely</HI> mix'd with them, as being <HI>separated</HI> in the Guts, but <HI>disappointed</HI> in its Passage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of a Coaliack Cholick.</NOTE>The Causes of this Distemper, are gene∣rally rank'd under Three Heads, which will comprehend all the differing Opinions about it. The First is a <HI>Cold</HI> Distemper of the <HI>Sto∣mach</HI> and <HI>Liver,</HI> which generate <HI>Phlegmatick</HI> and <HI>Glutinous</HI> Humours, which cover the <HI>Wrincles</HI> of the Stomach that it cannot <HI>retain</HI> the <HI>Food:</HI> Tho' Retention be made by the <HI>Astringing</HI> Quality, yet it operates by fit In∣struments, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>rawness</HI> of the <HI>Inward</HI> Coat of the Stomach; which rawness being taken away, and the Wrincles filled by the Humours aforesaid, the <HI>Retention</HI> is damni∣fied, and the Food <HI>Slips</HI> away without <HI>Con∣coction.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Cause assigned by others, is, violent <HI>sharp</HI> Humours, that prick, twinge, and irritate the Parts, by which the Sto∣mach and Guts are <HI>provoked</HI> to send out the Meat too soon.</P>
<P>The Third, and which I take to be the true Cause of the <HI>Caeliack Cholick,</HI> is, the Obstruction of the <HI>Mesenteraick</HI> Veins which hinder the passage of the <HI>Chyle</HI> to the <HI>Liver,</HI> or the Obstruction of the <HI>Glandules</HI> of the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> and therefore must of necessity be ejected by the Belly. If this: Disease is of <HI>long</HI> continuance 'tis very dangerous, be∣cause
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>Nature is <HI>deprived</HI> of her Nourishment, and the Weak Body is liable to the <HI>Insults</HI> of all Diseases.</P>
<P>Now, since the Disease called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a <HI>Lientary,</HI> is also a <HI>Flux</HI> of the Belly, in which the <HI>Food</HI> is quickly thrown out of the Body <HI>undigested;</HI> and differs only from a <HI>Caeliack Cholick</HI> in <HI>degrees,</HI> and that their <HI>Cures</HI> are the <HI>same;</HI> I shall omit treating particu∣larly on that Head, and refer the Reader to what follows.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cure of the Caelick Cholick.</NOTE>The <HI>Curatory</HI> Indication of the <HI>Caeliack Choliack,</HI> is, to remove the <HI>Morbisick</HI> Cause, and strengthen the <HI>Stomach,</HI> which kind of Method being seasonably begun, and duly prosecuted often does the whole Work; for the <HI>Cause</HI> of the Disease or the <HI>Root</HI> of it being cut off, the <HI>Effects</HI> depending on it, die of their own accord. Therefore if the <HI>Bile</HI> is sluggish, or stopp'd in its Passage, means must be used to make it more <HI>Active,</HI> to correct the <HI>Acid</HI> and Austure <HI>Ferment</HI> pro∣ceeding from the Stomach and Intestines, to retrieve the Natual <HI>Texture</HI> and distribu∣tion of the <HI>Bile</HI> and to promote the <HI>Separation</HI> of the Heterogenious <HI>Particles.</HI> If the <HI>Lacteal</HI> or Milky Vessels are shut up, endeavour to remove the <HI>Slime</HI> that choaks them, by at∣tenuating, opening Ingredients, <HI>Astringents</HI> are improper.

The <HI>Pulse</HI> high and unequal, <HI>Sweating,</HI> with Convulsion of the extreme <HI>Parts</HI> and Swooning, are dangerous Symptoms. 'Tis easily discover'd whether the Disease came by some violent Medicine, Poison, or of∣fensive Dyet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Internal</HI> Causes are known by the <HI>Quality</HI> of the Humours that are ejected. If there be continual Loathing and Gnawing, the Disease is in the <HI>Stomach.</HI> If a Malignant <HI>Fever</HI> is join'd, it is in the <HI>Veins.</HI> If it has its Original from some ill Diet, there is <HI>Hopes,</HI> that when the peccant Matter is cast out, the Disease will end. If its very vio∣lent, 'tis dangerous, for the greater the Con∣vulsions, Swoonings, and Coldness of the extream Parts are, the <HI>nearer</HI> Death is at Hand.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the Cure, you ought to assist <HI>Evacuations</HI> with gentle, cooling, and cleansing Clysters, especially <HI>Milk</HI> Clysters,
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>with <HI>Venice Treacle,</HI> or <HI>Diascordium</HI> dissolved in them are always useful. It's proper to <HI>breathe</HI> a Vein, to cool the burnt and boiled Blood, but let it be done with Discretion, Twice or Thrice, if the Strength be not impaired by the First. Endeavour to qualify the sharpness of the Humours after this manner. <HI>Waters of Plantane, Purslane and Mint of each two Ounces: Syrup of Quinces, and dried Roses, of each one Ounce; Syrup of Vinegary, half an Ounce, mix them, and dissolve therein two Scruples of Theriack Andromachi, and six Drops of Oil of Vitriol:</HI> Give now and then a Spoonful. But if the Patient has some <HI>Ease,</HI> and if the Symptoms abate or disappear, take great care that they dont <HI>suddenly</HI> return, to your Amazement and the Destruction of the Patient, as it sometimes happens <HI>unforeseen</HI> in this Case. Therefore Nourish him and Strengthen his Stomach, says most of our Eminent Physicians, with a Restoring <HI>Opiate,</HI> compounded in or after this Method. <HI>Gelly of Harts-Horn made with Canary Wine, four Ounces, Conserve of Roses, Burrage, Bugloss and Clove Gilly-Flowers, of each one Ounce: Confectio Alkermes, half an Ounce, Citron Bark and Nutmegs, Candied, of each three Drams; Essence of Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs and Cinamon, of each three Drops, and with the Syrup of Clove Gilly-Flowers make On Opiate;</HI> of which must be taken the quantity of a Hazle Nut or more, Mornings and Even∣ings. Of all the Medicines used against <HI>Looseness,</HI> says a great Author, <HI>Opium</HI> is the chief, being a powerful controler of all tumultuous Motions and accordingly pre∣scribes <HI>Laudanum Opiatum,</HI> or <HI>Liquid Lau∣danum</HI> in large quanties, for the Cure of this and most other Diseases.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
<P>But for my part, tho' I won't pretend to <HI>censure</HI> the Practice of my Superiors, yet I think my self obliged to say, that I tamper not with <HI>Opiates,</HI> nor ever use <HI>Laudanum</HI> but on extraordinary occasions, being rather a <HI>Pallative</HI> than a <HI>Curative</HI> Medicine; and therefore in my <HI>Practice</HI> for the Cure of this or any other Disease I pretend to Cure, I only employ my own <HI>Experiencd</HI> Medicines, which by their own native <HI>vertue</HI> subdue Diseases by their <HI>amicable</HI> correspondence with <HI>Nature,</HI> and by assisting her in all her <HI>Operations</HI> and <HI>endeavours,</HI> to support her <HI>self,</HI> and <HI>exterminate</HI> those noxious Invaders, that disturb her desired Peace and tranquility.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dy∣sentery or Bloody Flux.</NOTE>A <HI>Dysentery,</HI> which the Greeks name <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, properly so called, proceeds from the Ulceration of the Intestines, but is commonly taken for <HI>every</HI> Bloody Flux: The Latins call it <HI>Tormina</HI> from the excessive Pain the Patient endures. This Disease which is voiding <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>purulent</HI> Matter with tormenting Pain, is distinguishd from the Painless Evacuation of Thin, Watery Blood from the internal <HI>Hemerroid</HI> Veinsm, called by the Ancients a <HI>Flux</HI> of the <HI>Liver,</HI>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Symptoms of a Dy∣sentery.</NOTE>The <HI>Diagnostick</HI> Signs of the <HI>Bloody-Flux,</HI> are, that the Sick Person is seized with <HI>un∣sufferable</HI> griping Pains in the Guts followed by frequent <HI>Stools,</HI> first of <HI>Whitish</HI> Matter, and afterwards of <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Slime</HI> mix'd to∣gether.

<P>There are Three degrees observable in a <HI>Dysemery.</HI> The Symptoms of the first are <HI>Bloody</HI> and <HI>Slimy</HI> Stools.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progno∣stick Sym∣ptoms.</NOTE>A <HI>Dy∣sentery</HI> caus'd by <HI>black</HI> Choler is a dangerous Sign, if it be not Critical, because the Ulcer grows <HI>Cancerous;</HI> be sure there∣fore you make a right judgment between <HI>melancholly</HI> and <HI>congeal</HI>'d Blood.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of the Bloody Flux.</NOTE>The <HI>Internal</HI> Causes of this Disease are sharp and <HI>Ʋlcerating</HI> Humours. Yellow Green, and Black <HI>Choler;</HI> Salt Phlegm in the
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>Head created by <HI>Heat,</HI> or in the Belly by <HI>Putrefaction.</HI> which being brought to the Guts, and sticking close to them Ulcerates the Part. The sharp <HI>Acid</HI> that irritates the Guts, provokes them to <HI>Contraction,</HI> assem∣bles the Blood by vertue of its provocation, and corrodes the <HI>Orifices</HI> of the Blood Vessels. This may proceed from the corrupted <HI>Mat∣ter</HI> in the Guts. But the cause of a <HI>Malig∣nant, Epidemical, contagious Looseness,</HI> such as the Learned <HI>Sydenham</HI> discourses of, as hap∣pening in the Years, 1669, 70, 71, 72, is a corrupt <HI>volatile Acid,</HI> not lodg'd in the Guts, but immediately reigning in the <HI>Blood,</HI> per∣verting its <HI>Texture,</HI> opening the Vessels <HI>in∣serted</HI> into the Guts and <HI>provoking</HI> them to Convulsive Contractions; from whence is derived a Malignant <HI>Fever, Griping and Bloody Stools:</HI> So tho' the <HI>previous</HI> excoriations may take place in <HI>benign</HI> Dysenteries, there is no occasion for them in the <HI>contagious</HI> Ma∣lignant sort; it being a sufficient Cause of <HI>bloody</HI> Stools, that the <HI>Costick</HI> Ferment is a Mortal Enemy to the Intestines, like <HI>Arse∣nick,</HI> that perpetually thwarts and provokes them to <HI>Convulsions;</HI> upon which, says that excellent <HI>Author,</HI> they squeeze out their <HI>Blood</HI> together with their <HI>Nutritious</HI> Juice, that they are not then in a capacity to re∣ceive; and which is taken by some for the <HI>Mucus</HI> or Snot of the Guts, whereas the large quantities that are voided, sufficiently evince the contrary.</P>
<P>The <HI>External</HI> Causes, are all such things as procreate sharp and ill Humours, as Meats which soon putrify ill the Stomach, <HI>Fruits</HI> which are soon rotten, and all things <HI>un∣ripe:</HI> The Air thus qualified; the Winter
<PB N="78" REF="81"/><HI>co'd</HI> and <HI>dry,</HI> and the Spring very <HI>Wet</HI> and full of <HI>South</HI> Winds, cause <HI>Dysenteries</HI> in Sum∣mer. Or if the Winter be <HI>Wet</HI> and full of <HI>South</HI> Winds, and a <HI>dry</HI> Spring, and the <HI>North</HI> Winds blow much; such a Season generally speaking produces <HI>Bloody Fluxes.</HI> Sometimes the Air is infected and produces a Conta∣gious and <HI>Epidemical</HI> Dysentery, which is so infectious, that the <HI>Excrements</HI> of the Sick being cast into a <HI>Bog-house,</HI> infect, all that sit over it. To which may be added, the taking of <HI>Mercury, Coloquintida, Antimony, Lead,</HI> the course Pouder of an <HI>Adamant, Worms, &amp;c.</HI> which vellicate the Guts and heap up sharp Humours in them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To Cure of the Bloody Flux.</NOTE>From what has been already said, you may rationally infer, that Indications for Cure of a <HI>Dysentery,</HI> are, to evacuate <HI>sharp</HI> Humours, asswage <HI>Pain,</HI> Cleanse, Consoli∣date and Dry the <HI>Ʋlcers,</HI> Purify the <HI>Blood,</HI> separate the preternatural <HI>Ferment</HI> and stop the <HI>Flux.</HI></P>
<P>To discharge the Body of sharp Humours you must Purge every Second, Third or Fourth Day, according to the Patient's <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> and the <HI>Season</HI> of the Year. <HI>Rhubarb</HI> given in Pouder <HI>a Dram, a Dram and half, and two Drams</HI> is very usual; but because <HI>Pouders</HI> are apt to stick to the <HI>Guts</HI> and vex them, I better approve of it converted into a <HI>Potion,</HI> made of <HI>Liquoras, Raisms of the Sun, Tamarinds and yellow Myrabolans</HI> boiled in <HI>Bar∣ley-Water, to Three or Four Ounces;</HI> which Li∣quor being <HI>strained,</HI> infuse in it a Dram of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> sliced very thin; then add an Ounce of <HI>Syrup of Roses Solutive,</HI> and you have a very good Medicine to <HI>evacuate</HI> sharp Humours.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
<P>If the <HI>Dysentery</HI> is accompanied with a <HI>Fever</HI> and Inflamation of the <HI>Bowels,</HI> open a <HI>Vein,</HI> let the Patient Bleed in proportion to his <HI>Strength.</HI> Sometimes vomiting is pro∣fitable, to repel the Humours, which fall from the <HI>Stomach</HI> to the <HI>Intestines,</HI> and there∣fore not to be omitted, especially if the Pa∣tient is <HI>inclined to Vomit,</HI> for then Nature <HI>dictates</HI> the right way, and ought to be im∣mitated, in <HI>disburdening</HI> a foul Stomach. Afterward you ought to give <HI>asswaging,</HI> mild and cleansing Clysters, and succeed them with <HI>Astringent</HI> Clysters.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Ʋlcerss</HI> stand in need of <HI>cleansing,</HI> add <HI>Centaury</HI> and <HI>Wormwood</HI> to the former De∣coction, and to the strained Liquor add <HI>Tur∣pentine dissolv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the Yolk of an Egg, and the Chymical Oil of Wax, of each one Dram.</HI> When there is more need of <HI>Binding</HI> and Gluti∣nating Medicines, give <HI>Emplastick</HI> Clysters, to cover the internal <HI>Superfices</HI> of the Guts, and preserve those Parts from the <HI>Gnawing</HI> of the Matter.</P>
<P>To cleanse, give <HI>Goats Milk;</HI> to glutinate <HI>Cows Milk</HI> Chalybeated, which is proper to consolidate and <HI>heal,</HI> to which you may add the Juice of <HI>Plantan, Syrup of Comfrey, Sugar of Roses, Troches of Amber, and Rhasis's white Troches.</HI> Let the Sick eat <HI>Rice boiled in Cha∣lybiated Milk, or the Mucilage of Gum, Traga∣canth and Arabick, drawn with Rose or Plantan Water, the quantity of half a Dram in his Broath.</HI> To purify the Blood and separate the pre∣ternatural Ferment, <HI>Goddards Drops are often successful.</HI> And to <HI>compleat</HI> the Cure, the Body being throughly cleansed you may use <HI>Astringent Decoctions and Narcoticks to stop the Flux.</HI></P>

<P>And if this <HI>Course</HI> and these <HI>Medicines</HI> are ineffectual, as sometimes to the Patient's disappointment and extravagant Charge, they have been too often found; let the Sick <HI>try my</HI> Medicines, which have never yet <HI>failed</HI> to cure the <HI>Bloody Flux,</HI> in nu∣merous Instances, of which I only give you <HI>Two</HI> Examples.</P>

To Name more Persons whom I have cured of the <HI>Rheumatism,</HI> is wholly needless, since the Weekly Papers have from time to time, publish'd to many. And tho'. I don't pretend to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke a perfect Cure of the <HI>Gout,</HI> yet I hope I may be allowed to speak truth, and say, That my Medicines never <HI>fail</HI> to give speedy <HI>Ease</HI> in the most violent <HI>Pains</HI> attending that Disease.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Stone &amp; Gravel.</NOTE>Mr. <HI>William Cordwell,</HI> Frame-Work-Knitter, at the Sign of the <HI>Black-Boy,</HI> in <HI>Wheeler</HI>'s-<HI>street, Spittle-Fields,</HI> being violently afflicted with <HI>Suppression of Ʋrine,</HI> occasion'd by the <HI>Stone, Gravel,</HI> and a concommitant <HI>Cholick,</HI> which had continued at certain Times for Three Years last past, and since <HI>Christmas</HI> last in a more <HI>severe</HI> manner than ever; applied him∣self to me, and by the use of my Remedies aforenamed, voided several <HI>Stones</HI> and ob∣tain'd a perfect Cure: And having paid me
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>for my Medicines to my own content, de∣sired also, that his <HI>Cure</HI> might be publish'd, that others labouring under the same Di∣stemper, might receive Benefit by the same Hand and Means.</P>
<P><HI>Francis-Wilks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fevers.</NOTE> dwelling near the Sign of the <HI>Black-Horse,</HI> in <HI>Blackman-street,</HI> hard by St. <HI>George</HI>'s-Church, in <HI>Southwark,</HI> was seize Five Months with a <HI>Tertian Ague,</HI> and having taken great quantities of <HI>Jesuit</HI>'s Powder, or <HI>Peruvian Bark,</HI> and an incredible number of other Medicines, to no purpose; insomuch that he seem'd to be on the <HI>Brink</HI> of the Grave, and his Circumstances being but <HI>in∣different,</HI> I offer'd him his Cure <HI>Gratis,</HI> which I perform'd with great <HI>Expedition,</HI> and so <HI>effectually,</HI> that after the <HI>first</HI> Dose of Physick I gave him, his <HI>Fit</HI> return'd no more, and the Patient enjoys his Health to this Day.</P>
<P>The great number of <HI>Patients</HI> I have cured of <HI>Fevers,</HI> under all Denominations, whether attended or unaccompanied with a <HI>Cold shaking Fit,</HI> which are vulgarly call'd <HI>Agues,</HI> will excuse me from giving more Examples in this Disease, because my Medicines, are so well known to give relief in <HI>Fevers,</HI> that to commend them by Testimonies in un∣cessary waste of time, since they <HI>recommend</HI> themselves by their <HI>Innate</HI> Vertue; not be∣cause they are <HI>Hot,</HI> not because they are <HI>Cold,</HI> not because they <HI>Cut</HI> and attenuate; but because they have the <HI>peculiar</HI> vertue, to ex∣tinguish the <HI>hot fermenting Alkali,</HI> which is the <HI>Occasional, Internal and Continent cause of Fevers,</HI> and that they may effect what they are design'd for, I vary them as I find Oc∣casion;
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>because, <HI>vix ulla perpetua Ars Medici∣nalis recepit,</HI> scarce any of the Precepts of the Art of Physick are perpetual.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coughs and Consum∣ptions.</NOTE>Mr. <HI>Thomas Adin,</HI> Weaver, dwelling in <HI>King</HI>'s-<HI>Head-Yard,</HI> in <HI>Shore-Ditch,</HI> was long afflicted with a <HI>Consumptive Cough,</HI> attended with all the <HI>dismal</HI> Symptoms of approaching Death; but by the blessing of God, the Me∣dicines I directed him to take, perfectly re∣covered him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spitting Blood.</NOTE> <HI>Mary,</HI> Wife of Mr. <HI>Richard Darling</HI> Barber, formerly dwelt in <HI>Burchen-Lane,</HI> near <HI>Lum∣bard street, London,</HI> was in Three Years time last past, twice cured by <HI>Medicines</HI> of a vio∣lent <HI>Cholick</HI> and <HI>Spitting Blood,</HI> and the last Spring was seized with a <HI>Hectick Fever,</HI> and all the dreadful Symptoms of an approach∣ing <HI>Tabes</HI> or <HI>Consumption,</HI> and was given over for a <HI>Dying Woman</HI> by all her Friends and Relations; but by Heaven Blessing the <HI>Me∣dicines</HI> she took of me, she was restored to her former Health, as will be attested by more than <HI>Twenty</HI> Eye-Witnesses of her <HI>un∣expected</HI> Cure, as well as by the <HI>Patient</HI> her self.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French Disease.</NOTE>In the next place I could give many Ex∣amples of Persons I have cured of both Sexes, of <HI>Gonorheas</HI> and the <HI>French Pox;</HI> but because to give <HI>Examples</HI> in such Cases, would be a <HI>horrid</HI> breach of <HI>good Manners;</HI> I shall only recommend my <HI>Medicines</HI> as <HI>Safe</HI> and <HI>Certain</HI> in the <HI>Cure,</HI> and my self for perfect Silence.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Stone.</NOTE>The last Disease of which I shall give any <HI>Examples</HI> in this Book is the <HI>Stone,</HI> and shall begin in the well known Case of Mr. <HI>Richard Hurford,</HI> at the Sign of the <HI>New England Arms,</HI> near <HI>Ratliff-Cross,</HI> who was Twelve Years afflicted with the <HI>Stone,</HI> but lately in a most violent manner, and having taken abundance of <HI>Medicines</HI> in hopes of <HI>Ease,</HI> but all in vain, I gave him my own <HI>Medi∣cines</HI> experimentally adapted to the Cure of that Disease <HI>in his Case,</HI> which brought a∣way an incredible number of <HI>Stones,</HI> and some of them as large as were capable of passing through the <HI>Ʋreters</HI> and can scarce be credited by any, but those that have seen and handled them.</P>
<P><HI>Mary,</HI> the Wife of Mr. <HI>Richard Pomfret,</HI> dwelling in <HI>Little Carter Lane,</HI> near the <HI>Swan Ale House,</HI> was afflicted with the <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel</HI> to that degree, that upon any agi∣tation of the Body she made <HI>Bloody Ʋrine,</HI> and after she had had the Advice of several <HI>Doctors</HI> of Physick, but without success; the first <HI>Remedy</HI> I gave her, put a stop to her <HI>Bloody Ʋrine,</HI> and brought away a prodigious Quantity of <HI>Gravel,</HI> by which means she was Cured at a small Charge, and in a very short time.</P>
<P>Having thus plainly <HI>proved</HI> to the meanest Capacity, the <HI>efficacy</HI> of my <HI>Remedies</HI> the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of my Practice, and the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Examples of Persons cured, insomuch that they that are not blinded by <HI>partiality</HI> or by∣ass'd by <HI>Interest,</HI> must be Masters of a great deal of <HI>Sophistry,</HI> that will pretend to deny, contradict or oppose them. I should now put an end to this brief Discourse.</P>
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
<P>But having a little Paper to spare I shall employ it, in accommodating the Reader with the <HI>Vertues</HI> and <HI>Ʋse</HI> of a bitter Medi∣cament, which I invented, and call <HI>Tinctura Stomachicalis major,</HI> or <HI>the greater Stomachical Tincture.</HI></P>
<P>Which is a Composition of all the Noblest <HI>Bitter</HI> Aromatick and Stomachical Specificks in the whole <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and perfectly answers all Intentions accordingly. It enlivens and sharpens a languid <HI>Appetite,</HI> expels <HI>Viscous</HI> Humours; assists <HI>Fermentation</HI> and helps <HI>Di∣gestion;</HI> Fortifies the <HI>Stomach</HI> and prevents <HI>Nauseating</HI> and Loathing. It is <HI>Carminative,</HI> a great expeller of <HI>Wind</HI> out of the Stomach and Bowels; and as all bitter things are Me∣dicinal against <HI>Worms,</HI> so this <HI>Tincture</HI> has an excellent faculty that way. If any Person has the misfortune to drink <HI>bad</HI> Wine, or to drink to <HI>excess;</HI> if he mingles some Drops of this Tincture in his Wine, it will rectify all <HI>Disorders</HI> occasion'd by hard Drinking, and prevent next Mornings <HI>Head-Achs,</HI> loathsome <HI>Vomitings,</HI> and menacing <HI>Surfeits,</HI> the usual Attendants on Nocturnal Debauches. It's a good Remedy for Persons newly deliver'd from a <HI>Fever,</HI> or any <HI>Chronical</HI> Distemper, be∣cause it strengthens the <HI>Crasis,</HI> or convenient mixture of Qualities. It's proper for <HI>Ma∣riners</HI> to carry with them to Sea, and for those that Travel by <HI>Land,</HI> because it prevents ill accidents occasion'd by <HI>Ill</HI> or <HI>Scanty</HI> Diet, change of <HI>Air,</HI> and Epidemical <HI>Infections.</HI> It far excels all other <HI>bitter</HI> Medicaments; it never offends the Eyes, or causes breakings out on the Skin, as generally all other <HI>Bitters</HI> do. It will keep good many Years, and may be taken in <HI>Wine, Ale, Tea, or Spring-Water,</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="93" MS="y"/>from Thirty Drops to a Hundred, in the Morning, and at Four or Five of the Clock in the Afternoon, when People find occasion for it, either to <HI>cure</HI> Diseases, <HI>prevent</HI> them, or <HI>confirm</HI> one in a State of good Health, in which I have found my <HI>Tincture</HI> successful in many Years Practice; being as pleasant a <HI>Bitter</HI> as Art can contrive. <HI>One</HI> Ounce of Mine will make <HI>Three</HI> Ounces of any other <HI>Bitter,</HI> that is commonly exposed to <HI>Sale.</HI> And that the Poor may receive Benefit by it, I will Sell it to such as really are so, for Two Shillings the Ounce, and Twelve Pence the Half Ounce.</P>
