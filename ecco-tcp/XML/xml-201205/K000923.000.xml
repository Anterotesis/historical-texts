<HEAD>INTRODUCTION TO THIS SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not from any Vanity of appearing in Print, especially a second time, af∣ter such ungenerous Usage as I have met with from Persons calling them∣selves Reviewers, but to make myself useful in my Generation to unhappy Suf∣ferers, as far as I am able. I refuse not the poorest Person my Assistance (as well as the Rich) if they come to my House. The Pleasure I feel by relieving the Af∣flicted, overbalances all the Cavillings,
<PB REF="4"/>Sneers, and ill-natured Reflections of Reviewers, or any other Writers for Bread, who speak Evil of the Things that they understand not. Let them an∣swer me by solid Arguments, confirmed by as many real Cures as I have done; then I shall rejoice to hear so many more miserable Objects have been relieved from their Disorders by my stirring up the Attention or Ambition of others to Practice with more Success.</P>
<P>As the King's Evil is a Disease few of the better Sort care to own, I must beg to be excused from naming such Per∣sons, but only some few of their Cases. As to the lower Sort, I shall give their Cases in the plainest Manner I can, that the People of common Understanding,
<PB REF="5"/>without any Physical Knowledge, may in a great Measure judge whether their Complaints are Scrophulous or not. I have also inserted the Names, and Places of Abode, of such Persons, that by discoursing with the Parties them∣selves, their Friends or Neighbours, they may be satisfied of the Truth of the Matters of Fact, and receive far∣ther Information as to their own Com∣plaints. And as I make no Profit by my Practice, it is evident, I need no Arts to influence People to declare Un∣truths in my Favour. Greater Num∣bers of Cures I might have added, but hope these will be sufficient, to satis∣fy any unprejudiced Person, that the King's Evil, or other Scrophulous Dis∣orders, may be relieved much oftener,
<PB REF="6"/>and with more Ease and Safety, as well as with less Charge to the Patients, than the Generality of Practitioners are willing to allow, or the unhappy Suffe∣rers have hitherto experienced.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> LADY of my Family having many Years made it her Pleasure, to endea∣vour the Relief of all such poor Persons as were afflicted with scro∣phulous Disorders, or the King's Evil, and were recommended to her by Surgeons, or other Practi∣tioners; and having been very suc∣cessful in curing many such Cases, as they had given up and recom∣mended to her, made me very in∣quisite with her after her Method of Practice. She very readily in∣formed me of the Nature and Way of applying her Remedies, but would never (during her Life) im∣part to me the Names of the Things she made use of, or the Method of Preparation, but always told me
<PB N="iv" REF="8"/>I should find a full Account amongst her Papers after her Death, which I did (being her sole Executor.) With other Things, I found the following Letter to her, from an eminent Surgeon.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ONCE more sollicit your hea∣venly Benediction, and the salu∣tary Effects of your renowned Secret, which the World is from God and yourself, greatly obliged for, in Behalf of this poor un∣happy Lad (<HI>B. P.</HI> by Name) who is attended with the King's Evil in his Foot, and has been so for eleven Months; who I entirely submit to your Care (Providence being your peculiar Guide) in the mean while, I remain in Confor∣mity to Facts,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your sincere Convert, And a Public Well-wisher, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<PB N="v" REF="9"/>
<P>THIS Letter, among many others, from Surgeons and Apothe∣caries, together with the great Cures which she daily did, made me very seriously reflect, how useful a Per∣son she had been to all the human Species, which had applied to her in Time, being chiefly of the lowest Class of Mankind, whose Health and Limbs were their only Liveli∣hood: These were often relieved with her Purse, and always with her Medicines, and Advice Gratis; as also all others, who applied to her for Relief in this deplorable Malady. These Considerations, and the great Number of unhappy Poor, (unable to pay a Surgeon or Apo∣thecary) daily presenting themselves to me; and I knowing the Safety of the Method, and Medicines used in this Disorder, was imboldened to endeavour the Relief of my Fellow-Creatures, by following the Lady's
<PB N="vi" REF="10"/>Rules of doing good, for Charity Sake; which I have followed some Years, with such Success (for which I thank God) as surprizes even my own self. Such Objects of Com∣passion having been relieved, as pass all Belief of any, but such as have been Eye-witnesses of the Facts, from first to last. Since I have been in Possession of the deceased Lady's Notes and Memorandums, I have read over many Authors who have treated of this Disorder. <HI>Dr. Gibbs</HI> on this Subject, writes, "That if we take a View of what the most emi∣nent Authors have said of this Dis∣ease, we shall find their Notions of it to be of little Use, and very few Accounts of their Success in curing Disorders of this Nature." And tru∣ly I am much of the same Opinion. But this great Good have I learnt by reading their Works, and from thence observing the Operations of
<PB N="vii" REF="11"/>my own Prescriptions, that I have much improved both the Method and Medicines I at first used. I pre∣scribe no painful Applications, cut∣ting or cauterizing, blistering, or nauseous Loads of Physick, but such Things only, as Children of half a Year old, to the Aged of Seventy, may have without the least Hurt or Pain, and with great Safety be ad∣ministred to them. And I can iustly challenge any Person that has been under my Care, and followed my very easy Directions only, to allege the contrary. So that I can, with great Truth assert, That I have done some Good, and no Harm. The Cure of this Distemper by the Lady's Method, is no new Thing, but has been in some Measure used one hundred and fifty Years ago, as I have met with in an old Au∣thor; and having seen such won∣derful Effects from it, admire what
<PB N="viii" REF="12" MS="y"/>can be the Reason of its being for∣got, shall I say, or not used by the Gentlemen of the Faculty: But it is not according to their Method of Practice. That I am no Physi∣cian, Surgeon, or Apothecary, the Reader will easily see, by my not using hard Words, or technical Terms of Art, to puzzle and con∣found him; and my Patients all know I am none of the Faculty, by refusing Fees. All that come to me, are welcome to my Advice and Assistance Gratis. What Neces∣saries are wanted, they may buy of whom, and where they please. The inward Pleasure I enjoy on seeing any poor Sufferers relieved by my Means, makes me very ample Sa∣tisfaction for all the Pains I can take for their Recovery.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="tract proper">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Scrophula, or what is vul∣garly called the King's Evil, I shall now consider. The Word Scrophula (says a learned Writer) signifies a praeternatural Tumour or Humour, produced by a particular Acidity of the Serum of the Blood, either in Gland, Muscle, or Membrane, which it both coagulates and indurates, or in the Mar∣row, which it always dissolves, and also putrifies the Bone. Let us consider a lit∣tle this Definition: It says, it is a prae∣ternatural Tumour, or Humour; who doubts the Truth of the King's Evil, Tu∣mours and Ulcers being contrary to the Intention and Design of Nature, and consequently are praeternatural? Next it
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>says, it is produced (that is, a Tumour or Humour) by a particular Acidity of the Se∣rum of the Blood. This seems indeed to be the general Opinion of most Authors I have met with on this Subject, who usually follow each other, like Pack-Horses in the same Track: But that other Causes may have the same Effects, I shall by and by endeavour to demonstrate. The Nature of Acidity, according to this Definition, both coagulates and indurates. Coagu∣lation is performed on Milk by Acids, that is, turning the Milk into a Curd, it supposes the Acidity, or Sourness of the Serum of the Blood does the same, that is, curdles in the fine Vessels it enters into. But because Vinegar, Lemon Juice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are acid on the Tongue, must they be so in the Blood? What mad Work must Vinegar, or other Acids produce, mixt with it, let every one judge? Pray think what Quantities of Vinegar <HI>Newmarket</HI> Jockeys drink for a Month or two toge∣ther, to reduce themselves to a proper Weight for Riding Races, and then tell me of any Instance of the Scrophula be∣ing produced by that Regimen. Besides,
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>if this was the Case, why should not the Serum be as soon coagulated or curdled in the large Vessels as in the finer? which we see it is not, though the Serum of the Blood contains a proportional Quantity of this particular Acidity in the large Vessels, as well as in the small: And I am apt to think, that the larger the Quantity of Liquor, the sooner it will turn sour, and more sharp the Acidity; which I take to be the Reason, why the Vinegar Makers use such large Casks, even to the holding a hundred Barrels of Liquor in one Body.</P>
<P>I HAVE observed my Patients that have had Sores or Ulcers in their Mouths or Throats, have never complained of, or perceived any Sourness or Acidity of Taste, from the purulent Matter they have spit out, though I have been very inquisitive in that Particular, but they have always de∣clared they had a very salt Taste from the Matter discharged by Spittle.</P>
<P>THAT there is in the Spirit of human Blood a great Hostility (according to Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>) or an Antipathy in reference to Acids, has been plainly intimated, and likewise to many Sorts of Acid Spirits,
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>as of Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Nitre, Spi∣rit and Oil of Vitriol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not only against factitious Acids, but natural ones too, which he proves by many Experi∣ments, as the Curious may see in his Na∣tural History of human Blood, where he also says, as far as he has been able to observe, the Spirit of human Blood is manifestly preferable to that Classis, that many call Volatile Alcalies, because it makes such great Conflicts with divers Acid Spirits, as Spirit of Salt, Aqua For∣tis, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it will immediately turn Sy∣rup of Violets from blue to green, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> performing such other Things, that may be expected from Volatile Alcalies as such. And he seems strongly to intimate, that there are very few (if any Acid Particles at all) in the Blood, or even in the diges∣tive Ferment of the Stomach. But that great Quantities of Volatile alcalious Salts are contained in the Spirit of human Blood, he proves by many undeniable Experi∣ments, which if true, must naturally de∣stroy all Acidity in the Blood itself; so that consequently, it cannot be a particu∣lar, or any Acidity at all in the Blood, that produces the Scrophula.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
<P>THOUGH Spirit of Salt and Oil of Vi∣triol (which are strong Acids) will pro∣duce a Curd-like Substance dropped into the Serum of the Blood, so will Oil of Tartar per Deliquium (which is a strong alcalizate Salt) and also highly rectified Spirit of Wine, and many other alcalious Substances, do the like.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said, it appears, that there can be no Acidity at all in the Blood: But much Alcaline Salt there is very capable of producing all the Symp∣toms and scrophulous Complaints attend∣ing this Disorder.</P>
<P>THE Induration spoken of in the same Definition, I take to be only the Curd∣like Matter, hardned by Length of Time, and thrust or squeezed closer together by the Addition of more of the same Mat∣ter. That the Marrow in the Bones is dissolved, I have had no Opportunity to observe, by not seeing any Amputation performed in this Disorder. That the Bones often scale, and throw off Honey∣comb-like Exfoliations, or Pieces, and are also much corroded, I have frequently met with. But why will not a sharp
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>corosive Salt cause this Corrosion on hu∣man Bones, as well as common Sea Salt on the softer Bones and Gristle-like Sub∣stances of raw Beef, when long salted in the Pickling-Tub? I make no doubt but it will.</P>
<P>THE Reason why this Disease is called the King's Evil, as I apprehend, is be∣cause it has been often cured by the Royal Touch of our Kings in this Island, from <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor's Time (and how long before I have seen no Account) down to the late Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign. This has been the Subject of much debate amongst the Learned, because great Cures have been sometimes effected that Way, when other Means have miscarried; and other Means have often succeeded, when the Royal Touch has failed. What then shall we say? In my humble Opinion, there is something in the Nature of Gold itself very beneficial in this Disorder, I don't mean laid into the Hand of the Physician by Way of Fee, or pocketed by a Surgeon or Apothecary, but worn about the Patient's Neck, by a white Sat∣tin Ribband, hanging down to the Pit of
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>the Stomach. How often are Gold Ear-rings and Gold Beads for Necklaces worn for what People call Kernels, in and about the Neck and Throat, and for sore Eyes, which are all common Appearances in this Distemper, and not without some Benefit, as I believe many young Women can testify?</P>
<P>I VERILY believe that Gold being con∣tinually worn at the Pit of the Stomach, next the Skin, has often had great and good Effects, but then People will not attend with Patience enough the Success of such a gentle operating Remedy; for no doubt, but the fine Effluvia of the Gold being constantly heated by the Sto∣mach, and continually rubbed against it, will insinuate many of its fine Particles through the Pores of the Skin into the Blood and Spirits, and mixing in Time with the Juices of the Body, have very salutary Effects. But then I would re∣commend a Piece of fine Gold, without alloy, as large as a 36 <HI>s.</HI> Piece, to be used for that Purpose. But this is too charge∣able an Application for my poor Patients Use, though I sincerely think in many
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>Cases it would be very beneficial, espe∣cially to young Subjects, whose Stomachs are warm, and the Disease in its Infancy. Scrophulous Cases, says Dr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> may be ranked amongst the <HI>opprobria Medico∣rum,</HI> or Scandal of Physicians; and after his Description of the Distemper in its various Appearances and Effects, con∣cludes; I could wish our learned Chirur∣geons in this Case, would make their ut∣most Applications, for the Discovery of some Specifick, to correct this Humour. You see, this learned Gentleman ingeni∣ously owns, the Nature and Cure of this Disease was very little known by any of the Faculty in his Time.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> says it exceeds the Penetration and Capacity of human Understanding, to unravel and display those anomalous Clues and Convolutions proper to strumous Swellings, and to set their Nature and Constitution in a clear and distinct View; and that the acutest Men cannot penetrate and clearly unfold the essential Difference of this Disease. This, I think, sufficiently strengthens Dr. <HI>Leigh</HI>'s Observations of the small Progress
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>that has been made in the Nature and Cure of the King's Evil. Having but just mentioned the Opinions of these two learned Physicians, for more particular Accounts I refer the Reader to their Works, and shall proceed with my own Thoughts and Observations.</P>
<P>SETTING aside then the Doctrine of Acid and Alcaly, let us consider the Na∣ture of Salts, and whether they are capa∣ble of producing the Complaints and Ap∣pearances appendent to scrophulous Disor∣ders. That human Blood abounds with great Quantities of Volatile Salts (is suffi∣ciently demonstrable by observing only the Sweat and Urine) which are composed of Corpuscules, or Particles of very differing Shapes and Sizes, as Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> clearly proves, who after many Experiments, has found, that these saline Concretions exhi∣bit very different Appearances; some are strait, some crooked, with various Inter∣ferings, representing Branches of Trees, Hartshorn, Feathers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet, says he, these seem not to be constant Representa∣tions depending upon the particular Na∣ture of human Blood, but casual Figura∣tions that depend upon several accidental Causes and Circumstances. Now this Scrophula is very often an hereditary Dis∣ease, and conveyed by Parents: How fine then must the Seeds (if I may so call
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>them) of this Distemper be? yet so it is. As every Acorn contains an Oak rapt up within its Surface, till Time and Vege∣tation discover its Trunk and spreading Branches; so is it with this Disorder. If the Seeds are born with us, they lie dor∣mant in our Blood till a proper Time and a convenient Disposition of that Liquor, and the nervous Juices of the Body, cause them to grow and expand into grievous Complaints, and terrible Symptoms.</P>
<P>THE Blood, which seems to be the principal Seat of this Disorder, is divided into two Parts; the one called the Fibrous, consisting of great Numbers of fine smooth red Globules, continually floating in the other, which is a clear lympid Liquor, called the Serum, or serous Part, which conveys these fine Globules to all Parts of the human Fabrick, in some Degree or other. Now if any of these red Glo∣bules are broken change their Figure, or are obstructed in their Passage by the Serum becoming glutinous, or being in too small or too large a Quantity, or dis∣ordered by any praeternatural Commotion or Ferment, the Circulation through the finest Vessels will be the first impeded and hindered, as in the Glands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now think, if it is not agreeable to Reason, that as the Globules and Serum of the Blood may both contain a larger Portion
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>of these Volatile Salts when the Blood is disordered by any praeternatural Cause; and may not these Salts shoot into very different Figures and Sizes from what they were in their natural State, according to the Nature of the Humours or Distem∣pers that are latent in the Blood? And as these Salts are frequently of very per∣plexing and entangling Figures, may we not reasonably suppose, that those irre∣gular figur'd Bodies (carried along in the Road of Circulation) by crossing and en∣tangling each other, may cause Stoppages and Obstructions in the fine Tubes and Strainers of the Body, as the Glands par∣ticularly are? And by a continual Acces∣sion of these perplexing Bodies, distend the obstructed Vessels (by Length of Time) into Tumours, which are often indurated or hardened, till sometimes by their cor∣rosive Quality they fret their Way through the Skin, and break into Ulcers. What can this proceed from, but the red glo∣bular Particles, or fibrous Part of Blood, being stopped by the figur'd Salts, and the serous Part strain'd as through a Net or Sieve from the fibrous? The Serum for want of these smooth red globular Particles being mixed with it, becomes clear, tenacious, and sizey, the minute Parts of the Serum not being sufficiently separated and divided by those smooth
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>Globules as before, and rubbing against each other, are thereby rendered acrimo∣nious and fretting, and become produc∣tive of grievous Complaints, hard to be removed. Tumours and Ulcers gene∣rated by these or the like Means, are brought to a good Digestion with great Difficulty, and very probably not till the remaining red globular Particles of the Blood can be again mixed in some De∣gree with the clear Serum, and form one circulating Fluid of Blood and Spirits as before, which I suppose to be effected by melting, absorbing, altering or removing those saline acrimonious Particles that formed the Obstructions.</P>
<P>Now let us consider likewise the fi∣brous Part of the Blood, or red Glo∣bules, which being unable to pervade or pass this Rete or Strainer produced by these irregular figur'd Salts, and to ac∣company the Serum in its Progress, are there stopped, and being spqueezed and crowded close together for want of this Liquor to float them forward through the fine Vessels, obstruct the Spirits, putrify and turn into a Curd-like Substance, till it is digested by Art or Nature into a soft Pus or Matter, and so expelled its Nest. What is more common than to see large scrophulous Ulcers (especially in the more fleshy Parts) look of a deep red Colour
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>far round their Lips or Edges, which I apprehend to proceed from these red Globules being separated from the Serum, and stagnating in those Parts, until a proper Digestion is procured, and then the Redness gradully disappears, and at the same Time you may often observe a clear transparent Liquor stand in dewy Drops on that red Surface of the Skin through which it has exudated? Which I think a sufficient Demonstration that the serous Part of the Blood is in this Dis∣order strained or separated from the fi∣brous, and visible even to the naked Eye. And I have always found by Experience, that as the Quantity of this clear limpid Liquor has decreased, the Ulcer has dis∣charged a more laudable Pus, the Red∣ness insensibly worn off, and then the Ulcer has healed up with very little Ap∣plication more than dry Lint.</P>
<P>SHOULD I attempt to mention all Parts subject to this Disorder, I must name every individual of the human Fabrick, for I know of none exempt from this ter∣rible Malady, no not even the Bones themselves; for in my Course of Practice I have had this verified by repeated Ob∣servations: I have had a Patient afflicted with Tumours and Ulcers from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, and in above twenty different Places be∣sides
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>at once, the major Part of which have been cured by the Application of dry Lint only, and the Remainder by very simple Applications, and but very little Physick. But such bad Cases re∣quire much Time to make a perfect Cure. For any-body must think, that a Disease brought into the World with one, and so interwoven with the Constitution, and grown up with it, must have much Time and Patience ere it can be totally subdued and eradicated from the Blood and Spi∣rits. Though I have never seen any Dis∣sections of the human Body, yet I may guess from what I observe without, that the Stomach, Bowels, and Intestines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are no less disordered within, which must infallibly be the Source of many fa∣tal Consequences, unless removed by Art or Nature, as sometimes may be the Case. Every the least Tube or Strainer in the whole human Frame may possibly be tor∣mented by the Seeds of this Disorder, as they begin to expand, and long before they arrive to a Bulk perceiveable by the Eye or Touch. Unusual Prickings and Dashings, and Sickness at the Stomach, and Uneasiness in many Parts, are com∣mon Complaints in the beginning of this Disease: What can these proceed from, but the Assemblage of sharp, saline, in∣terfering Particles, endeavouring to force
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>their Way through these fine Strainers by Stops and Starts. The upper Lip swelled, Eyes inflamed, the Glands about the Jaws, Neck, Throat, and Shoulders, tumified, show this Disorder rather sooner (though not always) than most other Parts. The Backs of the Hands, Elbows, Arm-Pits, Ribs and Ancles, are fre∣quently affected, and as the Disorder en∣creases, the softer Bones feel its Effects, which if they exfoliate, are often cured, if not, usually terminate in malignant Ulcers of a cancerous Nature, and bring the Patient at Length to an End.</P>
<P>THAT the King's Evil is a Disease, <HI>sui Generis,</HI> or after its own Kind, I can readily admit. But then how often is it complicated and blended with others, as the Gout, Venereal Evil, White Swel∣lings in the Knees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which seem to have a near Affinity with it, by affecting the Bones and Joints much in the same Manner? But the various Combinations and Degrees of each particular Malady that may at the same Time seize on the human System, I believe is impossible to be distinguished and ascertained. Then how can we range the various Swellings common or extraordinary, that arise on the Surface of the Body, or lie almost concealed among the Muscles, and are at∣tended with such novel Appearances every
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>Day, without knowing every particular Degree, of every particular Disease, and their Consequences, that may possibly be at once uniting in the same Body and its Members? What may probably be the immediate Cause of this Distemper, I have already hinted at; but the more re∣mote ones, I may venture to assert, are as numerous as the different Appearances of Tumours and Ulcers in all Parts of the Body put together. I should soon wade out of my Depth, if I attempted to un∣fold such intricate and perplexing Combi∣nations, or the Forms and essential Pro∣perties of those fine Particles of hidden Matter, as may contribute to the Forma∣tion of the King's Evil, and have puzzled so many judicious and learned Physicians, and may still do so for Ages to come.</P>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to say something relative to the Cure of this obstinate Dis∣ease. If we search the most eminent Authors in pursuit of a Cure for this Dis∣temper, we shall find ourselves miserably disappointed, says a late Writer: I say so too. Therefore as their Prescriptions sel∣dom answer the desired End, I shall take no Notice of them, but pursue my own Way of Thinking. I have no great Opi∣nion of discussing of Tumours (unless the Face is likely to be much deformed by them, especially of the Female Sex; or
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>when the Eyes are inflamed, and very troublesome, then I think such a Remedy is justifiable) because the peccant Matter is only removed from one Part to another, and not cured, but still subsists in the Blood and Spirits, and may possibly be thrown on a more noble and dangerous Part, and do much more Harm than can be easily imagined.</P>
<P>MY Patients have often told me (to use their own Way of Expression) that they have had Swellings in their Necks, or other Places, and Neighbour such a one told 'um, if they did them with Vinegar, 'twould put them away, which it sometimes did, but in a little Time others arose in their Stead in other Parts, that would not yield to their old Remedy. If they were Parish Poor, and looked af∣ter by the Year, they fell to my Share, because nothing was to be got by them, and 'twould cost a deal of Trouble and Expence for Physick for such poor Wretches, who were better out of the Way. How unhappy are poor People, to be thus cruelly used by some mercenary Physick-Mongers? How many funest Ex∣amples are in every one's Memory (if they would recollect a little) of some Neighbours, or Acquaintance, that have even destroyed themselves, by backing or striking in Humours (as it is called)
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>and repelling them to some mortal Part? This Practice is too frequent with the Fair Sex; I hope they will think seriously for the future, and do so no more. If any Reasons occur to make Repellents neces∣sary, I then order proper Purgatives to carry off the morbifick Matter, cleanse the Blood, and prevent any Danger from such a Revulsion. Issues or Setons I never use, and often dry them up, for I could never perceive any Benefit accrue to the Patient from them. If Ulcers discharge the offending Matter lodged in or near them, why should we invite it another Way, and not follow the Road Nature has pointed out? What are Ulcers, but so many natural Issues, which will dis∣charge themselves, if a good Digestion is procured, as long as any offending Mat∣ter subsists in or near them, and then dry up of course, unless hindred by Art? Why then should we make an artificial Ulcer that Nature wants not? Nay, is even detrimental to it, by encreasing a Discharge, which we are endeavouring to diminish, and wholly subdue.</P>
<P>SALT Water being much in Vogue, I shall give my Thoughts on it as a Remedy for the King's Evil. I had a Patient troubled with a very painful Inflamma∣tion of the Eyes, which had baffled the Skill of all she had applied to in <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>(and being a Person of Fortune, be sure no Advice was wanting) she was sent to the Sea Side to drink the Salt Water, which she did for a Month, and returned much worse: When I saw her, I soon perceived the Disorder to be scrophulous; she kept in a dark Room, not being able to abide the least Gleam of Light, complained of intolerable dashing Pains in her Forehead, and Eyes, which discharged great Quan∣tities of clear Water, so scalding and cor∣rosive, that it excoriated the Skin where it flowed down the Cheeks. This Lady's Complaints were afterwards removed by a most simple and easy Remedy, which I apply in those Cases, and seldom miss of a Cure. What I would observe from this is, that the saline Particles of the Water, which she drank so long, added more Matter of a similar Nature to what was too abundant in the Blood and Spirits al∣ready, which entirely convinces me that drinking Salt Water is wrong in scrophu∣lous Cases of the Eyes; and bathing for them, I believe, to be equally hurtful, for we know many saline Particles may in bathing be absorbed through the Pores of the Skin by the Blood, and so unite with those already there. Observe what Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> says, <Q REND="margQuotes">"As it seemeth Salt draweth Blood, as well as Blood draw∣eth Salt."</Q> That is, they reciprocally
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>attract each other. Extirpating of tumi∣fied Glands (which is no unfrequent Prac∣tice) I have never used, either by the Knife, or Cautery, actual or potential; neither can I approve the Method, though I own its the most painful. I have had some Patients with me, whose Glands have been thus treated, and to all Appearance quite cured, and for a Time well; but as the Humour was not thereby eradicated out of the Blood and Spirits, it broke out again in fresh Places, which brought them to me. These fresh Complaints I have afterwards cured with easy and gentle Applications. Sometimes indeed, where the Disorder has been mild, and invaded but few Glands, and the Seeds of the Dis∣ease wholly contained in them, Extirpa∣tion has done the Deed. But if these tumified Glands can be reduced to their natural State by a less dangerous and painful Way (though indeed not so quick∣ly) and no Danger of any Tumours ari∣sing elsewhere: Which shall we choose, the more quick, painful, and uncertain, or the more slow, easy, and sure Method of Cure? How many have been salivated without receiving any Good? Instances of this Kind I have met with in my Prac∣tice, more than once. A learned Physi∣cian writes, <Q REND="margQuotes">"A Salivation is found by
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>Experience incapable of eradicating this obstinate Disease, notwithstanding it has such peculiar Specifick, and almost certain Virtue to remove the Venereal Evil.</Q> Which plainly proves (as I think) the Seeds or Causes of the two Distempers to be very different; and confutes the vulgar Notion, that the Ve∣nereal Evil is the Parent of the King's Evil; for if they both spring from the same Original, why are they not removed by the same Means? Which we find they are not; but when united in the same Subject, its rational to think they encrease each others Malignity, and render the Cure more uncertain and difficult.</P>
<P>MOST People afflicted with scrophu∣lous Disorders in their Eyes, are very fond of hood-winking or covering them from the Light and Air, which is the worst Method they can take, for it not only encreases the Inflammation, but in∣vites the Humour that Way, and conse∣quently occasions a greater Discharge from them, which should be carried off ano∣ther Way, and which is often of so cor∣rosive a Nature, as to excoriate and fret the Skin of the Face, as it distils down the Cheeks: I always make them throw away their Coverings, either going to Bed, or rising in the Morning, to prevent tak∣ing Cold, by too suddenly exposing their
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>Eyes; and my Success has always war∣ranted this Practice. After disapproving others Proceedings in the Cure of this Disorder, it may be asked, why I don't publish my own, which I think so much better? To such Enquirers I answer: The Medicines I use are very innocent and common Things, but the Prepara∣tion is curious and difficult, and takes much Time to compleat. Should I di∣vulge it, very few People (except the Compounders of Medicine) would attend the Process, or take the Trouble of it; and how little Good will a vitiously pre∣pared Medicine do, is obvious to any one: And as the common Labourers, and Han∣dicraftsmen, their Wives and Children, make the Bulk of my Patients, it is above their Capacity, and of no Use to tell them any Thing about it, more than what is necessary to their right managing themselves under the Regimen I direct, and to give them the plainest and simplest Directions possible, as well as to use the easiest Means for their Recovery. As to the Sellers of Medicines, I think they can have no claim to reap any Advantage from my Labour and Experience. The better Sort of Families infected by this Disease are really more to be pitied, than the very lowest Class of the People, for they are but too often amused with falla∣cious
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>and flattering Accounts of their own real Disorders (of this in particular, and as Dr. <HI>Radcliff</HI> truly observed) kept in Misery for their Money. And to every one in general I say, nobody has any Cause to complain of keeping the Thing to myself, for every one that pleases, and has the King's Evil, may apply to me, and reap the same Benefit, as well as if they knew the whole Process. (Great I know) is the general Clamour against Se∣crets, Nostrums, and old Wives Medi∣cines, as some please to call them; but I would fain know, if any prudent Person would refuse to be cured by a safe and in∣nocent Medicine, unless he knew the whole particular Preparation and Compo∣sition; or because I don't choose to make that Discovery of my Methods that pub∣lick Curiosity or Censure may expect? Did Dr. <HI>James</HI> publish the Preparation of his Fever Powder, yet I believe few Peo∣ple in their Senses would scruple the Use of it? If the candid, humane, and ge∣nerous Physicians an Surgeons smile on my Endeavours for the Publick Good, let the envious, snarling, and covetous Prac∣titioners blame me if they please, for not treating my Patients <HI>Secundum Artem</HI> (as they term it) that is, by not making long Bills.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
<P>I SHALL mention but one Thing more: Many People who have seen the amazing Effects of my Applications, often tell me, they hope I will not let the Secret, and its Improvements, die with me; I do not intend it shall; for I carefully write down every Patient's Complaints, the Methods I use, and the Success that follows, as far as I can be informed by themselves or Neighbours, who come to me on their Recommendation, by which Means I frequently hear of People I have cured, who living at a Distance, and being free from their Complaints, take no further Notice of me; though all I desire for my Trouble is, to hear from themselves, either by Letter, or Word of Mouth, when they are well: But all my Patients are not so forgetful of their Benefactor. My Papers and Observations relating to the Cure of the King's Evil, I hope will fall into the Hands of my Executor: And may he use them to the Benefit of Man∣kind in general, an the Poor in particu∣lar, with the same Success, and charitable Intentions, as I have done.</P>

This Per∣son had the Disorder hereditary, many of his Family having been greatly afflicted with it. He has travelled many Parts of England since, and been seen with much Admiration by many Persons who have talked with him. I cured him in about Six Months, and he continues well to this Day, and has sent me several poor Pa∣tients who have travelled on Foot near Fifty Miles to my House, who I believe don't repent their Journeys.</P>
<P>WIDOW of Joseph Prentice of Halsted, aged 70 Years, some Years ago had the Evil in her Eyes, and was re∣lieved,
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>and held well several Years, but her Eyes growing very bad again with great dashing Pains in her Head, and a small Tumor arising on her Shoulder, she applied to me; I cured her Eyes and the Tumor subsided with very little Trouble, and she remained perfectly free from her Complaints, till her Death, some Years after.</P>

Not long after, the Disorder fell into both his Eyes with some small unbroken Tumors in the Neck, and un∣der both Ears, and had been blind some Months, and thus came to me with both Eyes covered over, unable to do any Thing. He had a Brother a Surgeon, whose Endeavours with the Hospital Sur∣geons proving ineffectual, he came to me.

He had also a small Scropholous Tumor,

<P>SUSANNA SPOWERS, Wife of Martin Spowers, Mariner, aged 26, lately living at Mr. Vines's near Sir William Warron's Square in Wapping, London, had a large Tumor, very hard and livid, on the lower Part of the left Breast next the Arm, which had been extirpated by Mr. Caywood, Surgeon and Apothecary, near by, judged to be a Cancer; but as he did not cure it, about a Month after, she came to me. Then the whole Breast was inflamed, with two more Tumors rising on the lower Part, and some small Scropholous Complaints running about. These Tumors afterwards broke, and dis∣charged Matter as the other, which are all now well; and one other large Tu∣mor, about the Middle of the Breast, I dispersed without breaking. The whole Breast is now quite firm and well, smooth, soft, and of its natural Colour and Size, as before, except the Sear, which still remains as a Proof the Sur∣geon had been there. Whilst in the
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>Country under my Care, the Surgeon let her know, she had better come to Lon∣don, and he would go with her to an Hospital, to have her Breast taken off, before the Cancer should be fixt, for then it would be incurable. Note; Many scro∣phulated Breasts are mistaken for Can∣cers, and have been treated as such, to the irreparable Damage of the poor Suf∣ferers.</P>
<P>A young Lady in London, at the Age of 4 Years, had two Scrophulous Ulcers, on each Arm one, both dried up by the Use of the Bark, by Order of one of the principal Physicians in London; but soon after the Disorder broke out, with a deep Ulcer on the Calf of each Leg. Then I was applied to, and healed them up, but soon after neglecting my Direc∣tions, the Humor fell into both Eyes; then I was again applied to, and remov∣ed that Disorder; and she is now free from any Scrophulous Complaints what∣ever.</P>

<P>JOHN BUTCHER, of the Parish of Booking in Essex, Bayweaver, aged 30 Years, came to me from Bugden in Huntingtonshire, being quartered there, and belonging to Captain Carter's Com∣pany of the Essex Militia.

No Discolo∣ration, or any perceivable Tumor, or pre∣ternatural Heat to the Touch of himself, or others. His Captain who was a Sur∣geon, and knowing several of his Rela∣tions
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>were greatly afflicted with the King's Evil, pronounced it such; he soon after was discharged as uncapable of Service. I restored this Man to the full Use of his Hand, Fingers and Thumb, by the Means I make use of in Scrophulous Cases; which I think is a Proof this was a Species of the King's Evil. He was afterwards again admitted as a Militia Man in Cap∣tain Mayhews Company, being perfectly well, having the Use of his Hand as for∣merly.</P>

When I first saw her, she bathed daily in the Salt-water, which had so swelled and inflamed her Leg, she could hardly stand. I begg'd her to leave off Bathing, which she did, and in forty-eight Hours she found Ease; and in some Months after I had a Letter from her,
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>that her Complaints were by my Direc∣tions entirely removed.</P>
<P>A young Lady in Norfolk, aged 12 Years, about three Years ago had a small hard Tumor under the left Nipple, which seems now no more; but when she came to me, had a smooth, flatish, soft Tumor about the Bigness of half a Crown, ga∣thering above the Nipple of the same Breast, which had been under the Management of a regular Physician sometime without any apparent Advantage; but is now by my Assistance entirely removed.</P>
<P>Mrs. BROWN, Wife of Mr. Brown at the Bell in Clare Suffolk, aged 27 Years, brought me the following from Mr. Hawes a Surgeon.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Mrs. Brown, the Bearer hereof, hath for some Months laboured under a Disease in her Breast, which the Surgeons term a Schirrhus. Various Applications hath been tried, and many Medicines taken, which have only served to alleviate her Com∣plaints, without laying a Foundation for healing. This Disease hath so near an Affinity with the Evil, that I do not think but it may be really called such. I
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>wish you may be so fortunate as to direct somewhat that may be serviceable, and am,</P>

<P>Mrs. Brown was a fat lusty Woman: About a Year ago had a large Tumor rose in her right Breast, and gathered in nine several Places, and opened by a Sur∣geon, and discharged much, but that be∣ing though insufficient to lessen the Breast, two Setons were made quite thro' the Breast, (which was very large) close to the Ribs, in the Form of a Cross, and as the Silk rotted out, in ten or twelve Days, more Silk was put in, and she had seven or eight Ulcers in other Parts of the Breast. Several Surgeons met, to take off the Breast, and told her if it was not taken off she could not live to Michaelmas Day following; that her Breast would rot off in a Week or two, if not cut off. This was the State of the Breast when I under∣took it. November the 30th following, I saw this Woman; all the Ulcers well healed, and the Breast firm, and the Wo∣man in good Health a Spirits, without any Complaints whatever. Feb. 27, 1762,
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>she was with me again, and show'd me her right Breast sound and firm, but told me that about three Weeks before, on taking Cold, she felt a dashing Pain in her left Breast, which she shewed me. There was a smooth soft Tumor rising on the upper Part, above the Nipple, which had encreased fast, with some dashing Pains. I ordered her proper Remedies for this new Complaint. April the 4th, her Husband came to tell me the Tumor was broke, and discharged in seve∣ral Places round the Nipple. I ordered ac∣cordingly, and Sept. the 6th, 1762, her Husband came again and told me her Breast had been quite well 2 Months past, and his Wife in good Health a Spirits, no Complaint at all, and that the Day be∣fore he came she was brought to-bed of a fine Girl, and both like to do very well. I saw her some Days after, examined her right Breast, which had lost the Nipple, all continued firm, and also her left Breast, but she had no Milk in it, but no Com∣plaint whatever. Note, it is very easy to observe from this Case that if Mrs. Brown's right Breast had been taken off, it would have avail'd nothing, from the other being disordered in the like Manner. After hav∣ing cured Mrs. Brown's right Breast, I re∣ceived
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>from the before-mentioned Mr. Hawes the following.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>I must now congratulate your Success in curing this Disease, which is more rife by far than used to be, and likely to make sad Ravages among Mankind. Mrs. Brown I hear is purely. I am,</P>

<P>Febr. The 17th, 1763, her Husband came to my House, told me his Wife was in all respects perfectly well, and his little Girl a fine thrifty Child.</P>
<P>A young Woman unmarried, aged 26, had a large Tumor on the left Buttock, had been opened four times by a Surgeon, at least six Inches in Length, who told her he durst not cut any more, but must apply Causticks. She had two small Ul∣cers on the Small of her Back, and her Eyes greatly inflamed. The Buttock seemed almost divided into two. About eight Months after, this young Woman came to thank me, being well, without any Remains of her Disorder, and used
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>no other Means for her Recovery than I had directed.</P>

<P>SIR, I send you a Man from Bradfield Mainger, afflicted with the running Evil, owing in my Opinion to the ill Manage∣ment of the Apothecary, when ill with the Fever; if you can possibly assist him, hope your good Endeavours will not be wanting,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>from yours, &amp;c. R. R. Cox, a Surgeon at Great Welnetham, Suffolk.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This Man was Rob. London, Son of Rob. London of Bradfield in Suffolk, aged 32 Years. About twelve Weeks after hav∣ing had this Fever, thirteen Tumors rose about the Legs, Thighs and Buttocks, and had been all opened by Mr. Cox, and had discharged monstrously, which had re∣duced him to a meer Skeleton: he was brought to me in a Cart with a Bed made in it, being unable to move Hand or Foot, or to be moved without great Trouble. I went out to see this poor Man in the Cart: he looked so like a dead Corps, that People that saw him set out from home never expected to see him return alive, his Stomach gone, and Visage so ghastly. This was Aug. 31, 1761: and Sept. the 10th, I received the following from Mr. Cox the Surgeon.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>According to your Orders, have made use of the Medicines, but have since been obliged to open three more Absces∣ses, from which found a Sanguinous Matter, filled with a corrupted, from each Sore a large Quantity. Think the others begin to heal, excepting two, which are in the Calf, the other in the muscu∣lar Part of the Thigh: the Stomach holds well, and cannot find by the Face and Pulse, he is so much exhausted, as Na∣ture would be thought to be under his Af∣flictions.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The 23d of October following, Mr. Cox wrote me Word my Patient at Bradfeild was well, and in October 1762, I saw his Father, who told me his Son held well, and went to London every Week with Carrier's Waggon from Bury in Suffolk.</P>
<P>Mr. HARRISON, Apothecary, sent me Susan Ottley of Barking in Essex, single Woman, aged 26 Years. She came to me with almost numberless Ul∣cers, and fungous Excrescencies, extended from the Top of the right Shoulder, quite down to the Nipple of her right Breast, which discharged a most foul and
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>stinking Matter. She had an Ulcer on the In∣side the Arm, close to her Arm-pit, and a deep one on the Shoulder almost by her Arm-pit, and one withinside the Arm, a∣bout 3 Inches above the Elbow, and one almost under the right Buttock, a bad Stomach, and very had State of Health; had the Evil hereditarily, having a Sister died of it, and another Sister who had it much in her Eyes, which I cured. This Woman has now all her Ulcers entirely well, the fungous Excrescences all healed up, smooth and sound, has recovered a good Stomach, a florid well-looking Coun∣tenance, and perfect good State of Health, by my Endeavours only; but this Subject was many Months under my Care, so that I usually saw her every eight or ten Days, or I could have been of little Service in such a bad Case.</P>
<P>MARY BINGHAM, Wife of Adam Bingham, Husbandman, late of Crassing, now living at Patiswick in Essex, aged 28 Years, was led to me, being totally deprived of her Sight. She told me she had not seen her Hand or Child for 12 Months past. Both her Eyes looked al∣most as covered over with Cobwebs of a
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>leaden dead Colour, run much scalding Water, mixt with thick white Matter from the Corners of her Eyes, and almost continually dashing Pains about her Fore∣head, and many Scrophulous Breakings out, about the Corners of her Mouth, and several other Places. I bless God, I have restored this poor Woman to her Sight, so well as to dress her Children, and spin, which she does for her Liveli∣hood daily, as she did before she was dis∣eased.</P>
