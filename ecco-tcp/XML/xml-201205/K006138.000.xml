<P>A NECESSARY SUPPLEMENT To the former ESSAYS on the MEDICINAL VIRTUES OF HEMLOCK.</P>
<P>By Dr. ANTONY STÖRCK, AULIC COUNSELLOR, and a CHIEF PHYSI∣CIAN, to Her most sacred Majesty, the EMPRESS QUEEN; and Physician to the <HI>Pazmarian</HI> Hospital of the City of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>With several COROLLARIES and ADMONITIONS, AND A Figure of the PLANT, used at <HI>Vienna,</HI> Drawn from the Life.</P>
<P>Translated from the original LATIN, Printed at VIENNA, 1761, By a PHYSICIAN.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF we read with attention the histories of grand remedies, we see, their effi∣cacy was ever warmly disputed, at all times, and in all places.</P>
<P>There were physicians, who immedi∣ately condemned them, and proscribed them as hurtful.</P>
<P>But others, upon different experiments, praised and commended them, as most salutary.</P>
<P>By these learned disputes the thing was at last rightly determined, and applied to common use.</P>
<P>I plainly foresee, the same will happen to HEMLOCK.</P>
<P>But in the mean time I am very sorry, to see some medical people, of great rank, give a premature and harsh sentence a∣gainst <HI>hemlock;</HI> and to condemn it, and to dissuade others from it, as a poisonous and useless plant.</P>
<P>This savours of too great a desire of contradiction; and is repugnant to all rea∣son in medicine.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
<P>But the most cruel thing that has hap∣pened to me, is, to find those to be my enemies, whom I always treated with the greatest respect; to whom I have done all manner of good offices; and whose duty it rather was, to take my part, than to hurt me.</P>
<P>But I am neither concerned at that, nor thirst after revenge. And that these my adversaries may acknowledge, I am no ways disaffected to them on that ac∣count, although I may differ in opinion; I write these observations for their ho∣nour; offer and dedicate them, with all due respect, to them.</P>
<P>Bur I do not by any means desire, that they should shew me any favour. Let them only love the truth; act like just judges; and ingenuously own, whatever is for the good of the sick.</P>
<P>As for the idle clamours of some, I am indifferent about them, and despise them.</P>
<P>Whoever dreads the rattling of leaves, let him avoid a wood.</P>

<HEAD>A NECESSARY SUPPLEMENT UPON HEMLOCK.</HEAD>
<P>I Have already shewn, and confirmed, in two former volumes, the virtue and efficacy there is in <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>For that reason there was no occasion, that I should write any thing more on that subject.</P>
<P>But as there are still many, who do not rightly conceive my notions about <HI>hemlock;</HI> and doubt its <HI>species,</HI> and cha∣racter; it was necessary to give a figure of the plant.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<P>And that this might be rightly done, and made clear and plain to every one, without any danger of error, I entreated Dr. <HI>Crantz,</HI> the famous and indefati∣gable Professor of the Institutions of Me∣dicine, and of the <HI>materia medica,</HI> to bring this plant into his botanical garden, and to take care to have it well deline∣ated.</P>
<P>This he did willingly, and gave me this table, drawn and engraved by the learned Mr. <HI>Cipps,</HI> a candidate in physic.</P>
<P>From this any one, the least versed in botany, may know the plant at first sight, and distinguish it from all others.</P>
<P>But as for the extract of it, it is not every where prepared to my mind. For they take a large quantity of the expressed juice, which they boil in a copper vessel, on a fierce fire; whence arises a strong fetid steam, which is the best part of the medicine, that flies off: and besides, they do not take proper care to purify the juice and extract.</P>
<P>By these means is prepared a black mass, that is tough, and with little of the genuine fetid flavour.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<P>But when it is prepared in my way, it ought to be a thick extract, of a dark greenish colour, with a most ungrateful fetid flavour, much like the smell of mice.</P>
<P>Some have mixed other herbs with <HI>hemlock,</HI> and some leave the herb fresh gathered in a heap for several days, by which it grows flaccid; part of it cor∣rupts; and the juice grows roapy and slimy.</P>
<P>Others do not boil the juice as soon as it is expressed, but wait for a day or two, till they have leisure; by which the juice changes, and loses its virtue.</P>
<P>On this occasion I thought it would not be improper, to give an account of some cures, that I have made with <HI>hem∣lock</HI> alone, since my second treatise on that subject was published.</P>
<P>In doing this I shall be short, that I may not interrupt the leisure, or consume the time, that is so precious to physi∣cians, by tedious narrations.</P>
<P>When I say I gave <HI>hemlock,</HI> I mean its extract; which I take notice of, that there may be no dispute about words.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<P>Nor have I always added the dose of the medicine; because I have almost al∣ways begun with a small quantity, and gradually encreased it, till a good effect ensued: then I stopped, and never in∣creased the dose afterwards.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>A Man of about thirty years of age, complained, for several months, of a violent pain, and continual heat, in his belly: he had no appetite; the urine flowed as in a strangury; his stools were frequent, small, hot, joined with a <HI>tenes∣mus;</HI> the complexion pale, and the whole body emaciated.</P>
<P>Remedies of every kind were tried, but did no service : sleep was rather disturbed, and his strength began to fail.</P>
<P>HEMLOCK alone gave him relief in the space of three months: his appetite returned; the stools became natural; his urine was made freely; he gained strength, and a perfect state of health.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="case study">
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>A Youth of fifteen had a tumor for three months, of the size of a wal∣nut, on his left cheek.</P>
<P>A <HI>fistula,</HI> weeping an <HI>ichor,</HI> penetrated into this tumor.</P>
<P>The physicians and chirurgeons had here tried their art for a long time to no purpose.</P>
<P>But upon giving <HI>hemlock,</HI> the tumor disappeared; the <HI>fistula</HI> closed; and all his pains ceased.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman, forty-odd years old, had a very bad spreading tetter or ringworm <HI>(serpiginem)</HI> on her hand, above a twelve∣month, so that the skin was cracked to the flesh in several places.</P>
<P>Neither external remedies, nor inter∣nal purges, and sweetners of the blood, gave any relief.</P>
<P>HEMLOCK cured her within two months.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="case study">
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>CASE IV.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman, past thirty, perceived a <HI>scir∣rhus</HI> of a large size in her right-breast, for several months.</P>
<P>A plaster was applied, by which both the hardness and size of the breast were encreased, and the swelling spread under the arm-pit.</P>
<P>The tumor became of a purple co∣lour, with here and there livid streaks, and the pain so excessive, that she could neither sleep day nor night.</P>
<P>At length several knots or tubercles rose on the tumor, which threatened a very bad exulceration.</P>
<P>I being called in, desired that she would lay aside all kind of plasters, and cover the breast only with a soft linen cloth.</P>
<P>Internally I gave only the extract of <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>In the space of eight days the pain almost entirely ceased; the colour of the tumor changed; and the tubercles sub∣sided.</P>
<P>In nine weeks the breast came to its natural state.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<P>The greatest dose was half a drachm a day.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman, of twenty-seven years of age, throwed up every thing she swal∣lowed for three and twenty weeks, and was almost consumed by it.</P>
<P>Physicians, chirurgeons, quacks, and old women, had tried all their skill, with∣out any amendment of the disorder.</P>
<P>I ordered twenty grains of the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> in a mixture of four ounces; of which she took a spoonful every two hours; and in a short time the vomiting ceased; she recovered her appetite, and her strength.</P>
<P>And it is now three months, since any signs of the vomiting have returned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>A Man of seventy had an ulcer in his arm for five years: a sharp humor that weeped out of it continually fretted
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>the parts adjacent, and excited burning pustules.</P>
<P>The remedies that were applied anon relieved the disorder, but the itching soon returned, with a fretting of the cuticle; and the ulcer began to weep a most sharp humor.</P>
<P>The patient then took, by my advice, six grains of the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> every morning, and as many every evening, for five weeks: outwardly was applied the plaster of <HI>diapompholyx:</HI> and now in six months the ulcer is quite healed, and the old man enjoys perfect health.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE VII.</HEAD>
<P>A Noble old lady had both her breasts large and scirrhous.</P>
<P>A plaster irritated the disorder, and brought on great pain.</P>
<P>The nipple of the right-breast was twice as large as usual, ulcerated, and continually weeped a sharp, corrosive ichor. The tumor had spread under the arm-pits.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<P>The good old lady could hardly speak, much less laugh, or breathe freely, through pain.</P>
<P>The taking of <HI>hemlock</HI> immediately amended the disorder; the nipple was reduced to its natural size in four weeks; and in four months both breasts were cured.</P>
<P>There was no occasion to increase the dose above eighteen grains a day.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>A Man, about thirty, had a tumor larger than a man's fist, for a long time, on the right side of his neck.</P>
<P>He was, besides, cachectic; and com∣plained of violent pains, all over his body, and in all his limbs; which tor∣mented him night and day.</P>
<P>These complaints lessened his appe∣tite; he wasted away; and looked ill, of a dark yellow complexion.</P>
<P>Whatever remedies he took were of no service.</P>
<P>But as soon as he consulted me, I gave him, <HI>hemlock;</HI> by which in a few
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>days he grew better, and in two months was quite well.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE IX.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman, of thirty six years of age, laboured under malignant ul∣cers, for two years; which had eat into the tip of the nose, the nostrils, and the whole upper lip; so as to ren∣der the whole visage a most frightful sight.</P>
<P>All these parts were livid, hard, swelled; and violent pain deprived the miserable object of rest.</P>
<P>A sharp thin humor, continually weeping, corroded the adjacent parts.</P>
<P>Purges, antiscorbutics, mercurials, sweetners of the blood, made no alter∣ation; if it were not, that the dis∣order seemed to grow much worse.</P>
<P>Upon the taking of <HI>hemlock,</HI> a copious ichor, but much milder, was discharged; and immediately the swelling of all the parts fell; the pain ceased; and the livid colour was changed to a na∣tural one.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
<P>In three weeks time a great change was observed for the better; and the patient grew much stronger, and plump.</P>
<P>She then abstained for some time from <HI>hemlock;</HI> but matters soon grew worse; and the pains encreased.</P>
<P>But as soon as she began to use <HI>hemlock</HI> again, all the bad symptoms went off: and by a continued use of it for six weeks the ulcers were cicatrised; and the swelling disappeared.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE X.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman of thirty-two, had a pain in her right groin for six years, with a a hard tumor; and an acrid purulent hu∣mor dropped from the womb.</P>
<P>She imputed the cause of this disorder to her last lying-in, which was a trouble∣some one; in which the midwife extrac∣ted the after-birth with great force.</P>
<P>Neither baths, nor medicines, which she had taken for six years, had any effect on her disorder.</P>
<P>But by the use of <HI>hemlock</HI> the tumor disappeared in six weeks; the pain ceased; and the sharp flux stopped.</P>
</DIV2>
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XI.</HEAD>
<P>A Man of twenty-nine, was troubled with various venereal maladies for many years, but was never perfectly cured.</P>
<P>The glands of the neck, groins, about the ears, under the arm-pits, &amp;c. at last swelled; and created great pain night and day.</P>
<P>Antivenereal remedies, that are other∣wise the best in these cases, increased the disorder; so that a consumption was feared.</P>
<P>On that account he refrained from all medicines, by the advice of his physicians.</P>
<P>From that he grew neither better nor worse; if it were not, that his pains were often most severe.</P>
<P>At last he was forsaken by his physi∣cian in ordinary; who said, he would leave the case to nature.</P>
<P>But this patient had seen the good ef∣fect of <HI>hemlock</HI> in some others; from which he had conceived such hopes, that he came to me, and asked, if this medi∣cine might not be proper for his case.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<P>I immediately advised it, and he was cured in two months; the scirrhous tu∣mors quite disappearing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XII.</HEAD>
<P>A Virgin, of seventeen, had a <HI>spina ven∣tosa</HI> in her right-arm for three years; with very ugly ulcers.</P>
<P>Innumerable medicines, both external and internal, had no effect.</P>
<P>The belly grew hard, and big; an ex∣cruciating pain seized the limbs; and a cachexy came on, with a loss of strength, and emaciated habit.</P>
<P><HI>Hemlock</HI> alone reduced the belly to its natural size; cured the pains, cachexy, and emaciated habit; and healed the ul∣cers, and <HI>spina ventosa.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XIII.</HEAD>
<P>A Boy, seven years old, had all the glands of his neck, and about the ears, scirrhous, big, and painful.</P>
<P>His belly was moreover hard, and swelled.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
<P>Six grains of the extract of <HI>hemlock</HI> were given in the morning, and as many in the evening; the effects of which were so speedy, that all the swellings subsided within ten weeks.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XIV.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman, of twenty-five, had a violent cough for four years, and a very dis∣agreeable itching over her whole body.</P>
<P>White, pellucid, burning and corrod∣ing pustules frequently broke out all over the skin.</P>
<P>By a long use medicines she at last began to grow consumptive.</P>
<P>In this condition I gave her twice a day four grains of the extract of <HI>hem∣lock;</HI> upon which she immediately spit a very tough glutinous matter in quanti∣ties; the itching went off; her strength returned; with a perfect state of health, and good habit of body.</P>
<P>This dose of the medicine was not to be encreased; because it did as much as could be desired.</P>
</DIV2>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XV.</HEAD>
<P>A Man about sixty, after an intermittent fever, had his belly swelled; the right hypochondre tight and hard; a yellow complexion, without any appetite; and excruciating pains in the night-time in his limbs, which were emaciated.</P>
<P><HI>Hemlock</HI> entirely restored him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XVI.</HEAD>
<P>A Man of seventy, had laboured under a most violent vomiting, now for the third month; which could not be stopped by any remedy.</P>
<P><HI>Hemlock,</HI> dissolved in a mixture, soon stopped and removed it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XVII.</HEAD>
<P>A Rickety child, three years old, could neither stand on its legs, nor breathe freely.</P>
<P><HI>Hemlock</HI> carried off the whole disorder; so that the child breathed easily; ran
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>about briskly; and enjoyed better health than the rest of his brethren. I have many like cases.</P>
<P>In some, four or six grains a day are suf∣ficient: but in others the dose should be encreased to ten, twelve, and twenty grains.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>A Virgin, of six and twenty, was subject to most violent hemorrhages from the womb for some years: and when the flux of blood stopped, a thick, yellow, acrid matter was discharged from the womb, which corroded every thing.</P>
<P>Other eminent physicians, and myself, tryed innumerable remedies for a long time: but the patient found no relief from them; she rather grew cachectic, and swelled.</P>
<P>In such a stubborn case, I was willing to try, what <HI>hemlock</HI> alone would do; and for that purpose I gave her every day three pills, each weighing three grains.</P>
<P>After a few days I perceived, the co∣lour of the body was changed to a natural one; she gathered strength, with a good
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>appetite; and made urine plentifully, with much glutinous matter.</P>
<P>In a month's time, the whole disorder put on a very different appearance.</P>
<P>For respiration, which was before suf∣focated with the least motion, became free; the anxious palpitation of the heart ceased; and rest was easy and quiet.</P>
<P>But what was most remarkable, the hemorrhagies of the womb stopped; and the menstrual flux appeared in due time, in due quantity, and quality.</P>
<P>The matter, that flowed from the womb, was no longer thick, nor acrid.</P>
<P>In two months she appeared to all to be in perfect health; and only a little mild serum weeped from the womb.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CAXE XIX.</HEAD>
<P>A Man, about sixty, had a tumor under his chin, as big as a goose's egg, and as hard as a stone, and painful; which remained immoveable, without any al∣teration; notwithstanding the application of remedies, both external and internal, for a long time.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
<P>But <HI>hemlock</HI> loosened and discussed it, in the space of two months.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XX.</HEAD>
<P>A Cachectic, melancholic woman, of forty, began to decay by degrees.</P>
<P>No manifest fault could be discovered in the whole body, to which this disease could be attributed.</P>
<P>The face was of the color of the earth; the eyes sunk; voice weak; a fre∣quent palpitation of the heart; respiration was short and uneasy, on a little hard exercise; and the appetite quite lost.</P>
<P>The usual remedies in like cases afforded no relief.</P>
<P>But three ounces of <HI>hemlock,</HI> taken by degrees, restored the appetite, vigor of body, and chearfulness of mind; mended the cachexy; and now this woman enjoys perfect health, to the admiration of all.</P>
<P>A cachexy, with an emaciated habit, if it does not proceed from an internal latent <HI>vomica,</HI> or some corrupted bowel, is generally cured by <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="case study">
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
<HEAD>CASE XXI.</HEAD>
<P>A Boy of ten years of age, miserably torn with ulcers from a <HI>spina ven∣tosa</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A spina ventosa per totum corpus miserè exulceratus.</NOTE>, all over his body, and upon every joint, as well as in the face, and about the eyes, emaciated, and totally cachec∣tic, took various things for several years from the best physicians, but to no pur∣pose; the disease always grew worse.</P>
<P>Upon giving <HI>hemlock</HI> all the ulcers healed, and the scars are not ugly. Large pieces of the bones came off. He has now good strength, a natural complexion, and sound habit of body.</P>
<P>He has now taken every day, for seve∣ral weeks, a whole drachm of the ex∣tract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> the dose having been gradually increased.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE XXII.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman above forty, has now for two years laboured under an open <HI>cancer,</HI> most miserably ulcerated.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
<P>By the internal and external use of <HI>hem∣lock,</HI> the whole ulcer is now almost heal∣ed.</P>
<P>She was before totally emaciated; with night sweats; and loss of appetite.</P>
<P>But now she has gathered strength; the complexion is good; sleep quiet; the pain is gone; the sweats have ceased; and the emaciated habit is no more to be dis∣cerned.</P>
<P>A drachm and a half of the extract of <HI>hemlock</HI> is still given every day.</P>
<P>In another woman thirty-odd years old, I reduced a large open <HI>cancer</HI> to a small size by the sole use of <HI>hemlock,</HI> in six weeks; and a <HI>cicatrix</HI> now begins to be formed.</P>
<P>These cases occurred to me in my practice in the city. But as for those things that I have seen in the hospital, which are certainly wonderful, and de∣serve the attention of the learned world, I could not relate them here; because Mr. <HI>Collin,</HI> my excellent collegue, is faithfully describing them, and will soon commit them to the press.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
<P>We daily see so good and so manifest effects of <HI>hemlock</HI> in the hospital, that not only the students of physic, but other ignorant people, who are about the sick, are astonished, and wonder at them.</P>
<P>Nevertheless there are some cases, in which there is no success.</P>
<P>For if the disease is got to too great a height; or the whole habit is destroyed, who is there that will cure? or from what method of practice can we pro∣mise health?</P>
<P>We neither perform, nor desire, mi∣racles from our medicines; but we wait to see how far we can go by art.</P>
<P>If we meet with any obstacle, we con∣sider, whether that is to be overcome by art: when we cannot do that, we ac∣knowledge, that we are but men, and are yet ignorant of many things.</P>
<P>We do not imagine, that we are supe∣rior in art to others; but daily desire to be taught by the meanest.</P>
<P>But we likewise desire others, that they will be of the same mind towards us, if we err, or have erred; and that they will shew our error in friendship and decency;
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>then we shall neither blush to be taught better things, nor prove obstinate.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>COROLLARIES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>THE extract of <HI>hemlock</HI> is a very inno∣cent medicine.</P>
<P>It may, by gradually increasing the dose, be given to the quantity of two, three, or four drachms a day.</P>
<P>And the use of so great a dose may be safely continued for several weeks.</P>
<P><HI>Hemlock</HI> neither hurts infants, children, the middle-aged, the old, decrepit, wo∣men big with child, the embryo's in the womb, noble nor plebeian.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>HEMLOCK neither excites a greater motion, nor other disturbance, in the cir∣culation of the blood.</P>
<P>It neither cools, nor heats.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>The extract of <HI>hemlock</HI> is a most effi∣cacious medicine.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
<P>But it sometimes, although rarely, moves the belly; and much more rarely excites vomiting; sometimes it increases perspiration; but it very often discharges a plentiful glutinous urine.</P>
<P>But in many patients it does not sen∣sibly increase any evacuation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>The extract of <HI>hemlock</HI> has the greatest resolving quality; and often penetrates, and reaches to parts, which the most powerful remedies hitherto known could not touch.</P>
<P>It opens obstructions; and by that means restores a free circulation of the blood, when it is disturbed, and obstruc∣ted.</P>
<P>Hence it removes a languor, numb∣ness, and pain in the limbs, proceeding from that cause.</P>
<P>It renders the mind serene, and the body strong and active.</P>
<P>It increases the secretions; whence it often makes the ears, nose, mouth, and jaws moist, when dry; and makes them perspire.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
<P>Men who have no children, from an immeability or obstruction of the vessels, it renders fruitful.</P>
<P>It removes a hardness or mucosity in the wombs of women; opens a passage for the menstrual flux, obstructed from that cause; and prepares a fit place for conception.</P>

<P>HEMLOCK often resolves tumors aris∣ing from obstructions; and carries off even old scirrhuses, that resist all other the most efficacious remedies.</P>
<P>Nor does it signify, in what part of the body such tumors lurk; it acts with equal energy on all parts: thus it removes ob∣structions in the sublingual and subaxil∣lary glands, about the ears, in the neck, under the arm-pits, in the breast, belly, groins, anus, vagina, uterus, penis, scro∣tum, testicles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>HEMLOCK cures the diseases, that en∣sue after a malignant small-pox.</P>
<P>To confirm this, Dr. <HI>Lebmacker,</HI> an eminent physician of this city, wrote me the two following histories.</P>
<P>The first is the history of his own son, which was thus:</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>'My son, an infant five months old, otherwise in perfect health, was seized with the small-pox on the
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>26th of February, 1760; which, al∣though distinct, was not of so good a kind.</P>
<P>On the ninth day of the disease a sud∣den diarrhoea came on, whence all the pustules on the left-side from head to foot sunk in, while those on the right-side remained full.</P>
<P>On this the left-arm, knee, and foot swelled to an enormous size, with great pain and inability; which the poor in∣fant made us sensible of by its shrieks, if it was touched.</P>
<P>No aperture could be made in these tumors, either by nature or art; but they were cured in four months time by the skill of an expert chirurgeon, Mr. <HI>Le∣ber,</HI> without any impediment in the ac∣tion of the parts.</P>
<P>But as the cross child could not be prevailed upon to take any medicine, either in the time of the small-pox, or thereafter; and his mother's milk, with a milk diet, were not sufficient to as∣suage the virulence of the variolous matter, his whole body was in time covered with innumerable ugly ichorous
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>ulcers, from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet; so that he had no∣thing but a swelled belly, and ulcerated skin, to cover the bones.</P>
<P>The child being thus left in this de∣plorable condition, till it was one and twenty months old, that is, till June 1761, all hopes of its recovery were over, as it grew worse and worse every day. I was willing, however, to try, what the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> given as we could, might do in such a case.</P>
<P>From the beginning of June, then, I gave him daily two grains, one in the morning, in a weak decoction of coffee and toasted barley, with milk; and ano∣ther in the evening, in chocolate, that he might not discern it.</P>
<P>I so increased the dose by degrees, that he took daily six grains, without any regard to his diet.</P>
<P>By these means the ulcers began to afford a good <HI>pus,</HI> to be cleansed, to heal up, and to disappear over the whole body; only a scab or two remaining among the hair of his head.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
<P>By the middle of July he had got so much strength, that he could run up and down very briskly, both within doors and without, with his head up∣right, and his eyes clear and open; nei∣ther fearing the rays of the sun, nor a candle, which he could not bear for two months before, on account of his inflamed eyes, which made him hang his head, and put his hands to his eyes, whenever any light came before them.</P>
<P>Thus by degrees the child, that was before intolerably cross, now runs about all day with chearfulness at his play.'</P></Q>
<P>He took six drachms of the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> but no other medicine.</P>
<P>Now, my good readers! if we had only this single case to vouch it, would not <HI>hemlock</HI> deserve the greatest praise?</P>
<P>HEMLOCK was given to an infant quite extenuated, covered with ulcers, and in the worst cachectic habit of body, of which he was cured.</P>
<P>HEMLOCK then is an innocent reme∣dy, and it is an efficacious one.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, some terrible cal∣culators in medicine, who will, perhaps,
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>attribute this cure, to the decoction of toasted barley, infusion of coffee, choco∣late, or to the force of nature.</P>
<P>But they must know, that this child took those drinks before he used the <HI>hem∣lock,</HI> but grew worse upon it: so that we can neither attribute his recovery to the force of nature, nor to this drink. But as soon as the extract of <HI>hemlock</HI> was given, the infant began to grow better.</P>
<P>Whence, O <HI>hemlock!</HI> the praise is due to thee.</P>
<P>The second history is the following one, communicated to me by the same learned gentleman.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>'About the end of June, 1761, I met by chance a certain noble lady of three and twenty, who had been afflicted with the confluent small-pox eighteen years before, the sad remains of which she still bewails; for besides the loss of her right eye, she had an ulcer, with a hard swelling, on her right cheek</P>
<P>Various remedies, as she said, both internal and external, had been tried to heal this sore; but they were all, even to a salivation itself, given in vain.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
<P>Remembring the success of the ex∣tract of <HI>hemlock</HI> in a like disease, I ad∣vised the same to her.</P>
<P>Altho' she was now tired of medi∣cines, yet she consented to it.</P>
<P>She began then, on the first of July, to take every day eight grains of the ex∣tract of <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>Taking off the plaster, of what kind I know not, I took care to have the ul∣cer fomented with a linen-cloth, dipt in a decoction of <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>In eight days the tumors appeared to be both less, and softer; and there seemed to be some slight tokens of a ci∣catrix forming on the lips of the ulcer.</P>
<P>In the mean time, proud flesh sprung up here and there in the mid∣dle of the ulcer; which was taken off by sprinkling the powder of <HI>hemlock</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>The crust occasioned by this, I took off with honey of roses, mixed with the same powder: which were repeated, as often as the proud flesh sprang up again.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
<P>In the mean time I increased the pills, so that for three weeks past she has taken every day thirty two grains.</P>
<P>This dose I have hitherto continued, intermitting now and then a day or two.</P>
<P>About this time, the tumors, and hardness, almost entirely went off; the ulcer began to be cleansed, to be dried up, and to be covered with a thin skin; and thus it has remained closed now for six weeks.</P>
<P>She will go on with the same dose of <HI>hemlock,</HI> till the cicatrix is sound.</P>
<P>She has now taken, from the begin∣ning of June to the end of September, four ounces of the extract of <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>She received no benefit from any other medicine for eighteen years.</P>
<P>But now, by the use of <HI>hemlock,</HI> she finds her appetite to be increased; she grows plump; is free from rheumatic pains, which she was before troubled with; and has no other complaint.'</P></Q>
<P>Is there any man in his senses who doubts of the efficacy of <HI>hemlock?</HI></P>
<P>Since <HI>hemlock</HI> operates on the virulent
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>remains of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> a question a∣rises upon it; whether it may not be al∣lowable to give it, in a malignant vario∣lous distemper itself, in a spare dose, by a prudent hand, with judicious and pro∣vident care? it is agreeable to nature, and appears from an infinite course of experi∣ence, that vegetables of whatever kind may be digested in our stomachs, and converted into the inquiline juices of the body; but minerals cannot.</P>
<P>VEGETABLES, <HI>then, are more easily borne by our nature, and are by far more safe and agreeable to it.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore if it was allowable to others to use <HI>mercury,</HI> and antimony, in a viru∣lent state of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> why may not we be allowed, without any remorse, to try <HI>hemlock,</HI> since the best remedies yet known do nothing; these two cases of the learned <HI>Lebmacher</HI> were very necessa∣ry here, to make this proposition appear worthy of approbation.</P>
<P>I have likewise, from other physicians both of this and foreign countries, some excellent cases relating to <HI>hemlock,</HI> in which it proved successful: and I have
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>others, in which it did not succeed so well; but I have thought proper to reserve all these for another time.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ADMONITIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Corollaries are deduced from, and confirmed by, repeated experi∣ence.</P>
<P>But I beseech all, and every physicians, not to persuade themselves, that I am of such an opinion as to believe, that these rules are general, and that <HI>hemlock</HI> ought always to cure.</P>
<P>I say and openly own, that I have like∣wise had patients of all kinds, to whom <HI>hemlock</HI> was of no service; altho' it was indicated from a similitude of the disease.</P>
<P>But I do not believe, there are any, who will doubt of the truth of the cases I have related.</P>
<P>But if any one makes a scruple about the truth of the matter, and suspects my probity, let him go to the <HI>illustrious Van Swieten;</HI> who has the names of the pati∣ents, and an account of their place of abode.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
<P>Happy me! who have an opportunity to practice physic under the auspices of so <HI>great a man.</HI></P>
<P>I have seen patients labouring under the worst <HI>cancer</HI> of the breast, whom <HI>hemlock</HI> soon relieved: but there were several others, to whom <HI>hemlock</HI> only afforded some relief, but did not cure them: others found no alteration from the use of <HI>hem∣lock:</HI> one or two could not bear <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>I would have the same to be understood of other diseases, for which I have com∣mended <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>For I only contend, that <HI>hemlock</HI> is sometimes of service, and does wonders, where other the most famous and extol∣led medicines do nothing.</P>
<P>If other physicians still find other reme∣dies, we may be able, in time, to cure the most difficult diseases.</P>
<P>Truly! I congratulate myself, when I hear, there are several physicians, who follow my example about divers vegeta∣bles.</P>
<P>How many thousands of plants are there, whose virtues we are ignorant of? But to discover these, there are required
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>industry, labor, provident care, and a mind free from all sects.</P>
<P>Neither should you swear by the dic∣tates of a master.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is always to be remem∣bered, that there are limites both to art and medicines.</P>
<P>Now when <HI>hemlock</HI> is sometimes of service, but at other times does nothing in the same disease; it is certain there must be some latent difference, the diag∣nostic signs of which are yet unknown to us; nor am I alone sufficient to determine those things; and for that reason I have not hitherto been able, to give any cer∣tain rules.</P>
<P>But they who might and ought to have assisted me, desired to be excused. Yea they have even, by sharp censures, and repeated harangues to the sons of art, condemned and proscribed my works, and would have them destroyed by fire and sword.</P>
<P>Ah me! miserable fate of man.</P>
<P>In my two treatises on <HI>hemlock,</HI> I have related both the cases that were success∣ful, and those that proved unsuccessful:
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>and moreover I always admonished, that <HI>hemlock</HI> would not prove of equal service to all: I said farther, in my second book, it was enough to me, if I shall preserve and cure one patient in a hundred by the use of <HI>hemlock,</HI> who could not be restored by other medicines.</P>
<P>If every one of the other ninety-nine physicians will do as much as I have done, then all the hundred patients will be cured.</P>
<P>Could any man write with more sin∣cerity and honesty? It is allowable to propose our experiments faithfully and cautiously to the world: but after that every physician is at liberty, to use such a remedy, or to let it alone.</P>
<P>I neither desire honor, glory, immortal fame, nor profit: I would only desire to be useful to mankind, afflicted with so many miserable distempers; and would be willing to relieve such calamities. This is the duty of every physician; I beg, then, that others would give me no dis∣turbance.</P>
<P>I have given to the sick some hundred pounds of the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> and can
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>affirm, with a safe conscience, that I ne∣ver hurt any one. For when I saw things to be in a right way, I went on boldly, continued, and increased the dose: but as soon as I observed (which very rarely happens) that the sick did not do well from it, I forbore, and laid aside <HI>hemlock.</HI> This is the rule of art.</P>
<P>Since then this medicine prudently given cannot hurt, our art requires, that it should be farther recommended to all; in order to make numbers of trials, which may be collated together, and compared according to their signs, symptoms, and events. Then let the reasons and causes be inquired into, why <HI>hemlock</HI> is some∣times of service, and makes a radical cure; and why it sometimes does nothing in the same disease.</P>
<P>Upon seeing the difference, and find∣ing out the cause, it will appear, how far the efficacy of <HI>hemlock</HI> may extend. And then a reason may be given, why <HI>hemlock</HI> does not act equally upon all. It may then likewise be determined, with what cases it evidently agrees; and in what it performs nothing.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
<P>These observations being rightly di∣gested, we may be able to apply some other remedy, in cases where <HI>hemlock</HI> is inactive.</P>
<P>By such means the bounds of our art will be extended, to the great benefit of the community.</P>
<P>In some cases, where <HI>hemlock</HI> had not the effects I expected from it, I have tried other remedies; and not without success.</P>
<P>If that was not sufficient, I have ano∣ther ready.</P>
<P>Thus I shall ascend by degrees; and I hope in God, that he will prosper my endeavours, which are only intended for the welfare of my neighbours.</P>
<P>I here faithfully promise my adver∣saries, I shall employ the more pains upon those things, the more they endeavour to interrupt and hinder me.</P>
<P>While I do what is right, I fear no body.</P>
<P>Although <HI>hemlock</HI> is a most innocent remedy, yet I could wish, that every physician would always begin with a small dose, and gradually increase it.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
<P>For we know, how strange and diverse the peculiar temperaments of men are; whence there may be some, who may not bear this remedy.</P>
<P>By a small dose then, no one will com∣mit a fault: because a good physician will discontinue a medicine, where he observes any sinister event.</P>
<P>But it is always to be well observed, whether that event may be owing to the medicine; or to the symptoms that ac∣company the disease; or to an error in the non-naturals.</P>
<P>There are some, who are tormented, vomit, are seized with a fever, and faint away, only from taking crabs eyes, which are certainly a most innocent medicine: and why should there not be others, who, from some latent cause, may be ill affect∣ed with <HI>hemlock?</HI></P>
<P>But is <HI>hemlock</HI> therefore no medicine? Ought <HI>hemlock</HI> to be condemned on that account? No prudent physician will think so.</P>
<P>If the use of <HI>hemlock</HI> proves prejudicial to any, it is not to be attributed to the medicine, but to the fault of the pre∣scriber;
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>if we take the thing in a strict, and true medical sense.</P>
<P>Symptoms of a different nature from the disease are often complicated with it: and then it is requisite, that other reme∣dies should be applied, besides <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>If spasms or convulsions prove trouble∣some, antihysteric nervine remedies are wanted.</P>
<P>If pains are violent, paregorics and opiates become necessary. A high fever, and full pulse, require cooling nitrous remedies.</P>
<P>In a putrid state of the juices, or if an intermittent fever comes upon the use of <HI>hemlock,</HI> the bark is added to it.</P>
<P>Sometimes purging is needful, some∣times bleeding.</P>
<P>Too great a flow of sharp humours on a part requires an issue, or seton.</P>
<P>Neither ought a fomentation or cata∣plasm of <HI>hemlock</HI> always to be applied outwardly; but they are to be changed, according to the judgment and experience of a good physician, or chirurgeon.</P>
<P>If ulcers are drest with lint, great care should be used in taking it off; lest the
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>threads adhering to the naked vessels should be torn off with force, which might hurt every thing: a haemorrhage might ensue, from which proud flesh, springs up.</P>
<P>They should all be first moistened with the weakest infusion of <HI>hemlock,</HI> or other proper liquid.</P>
<P>The more urging symptoms often de∣mand, that the use of <HI>hemlock,</HI> both ex∣ternal and internal, should be left off for some time; till these are either cured, or at least mitigated.</P>
<P>We should endeavour to palliate dis∣orders in those persons, who do not bear <HI>hemlock;</HI> so long as we are unacquainted with any other remedy.</P>
<P>The bones, tumors, <HI>scirrhuses,</HI> are often attended with great pain in their inner∣most recesses: I have often observed in such cases, there was an erosion, or corrup∣tion, in that place: but a corrupted part should be separated from the sound, which cannot be done without an external aper∣ture, made by a caustic application, or chirurgical instrument; but by the use
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>of <HI>hemlock</HI> it is often made spontane∣ously.</P>
<P>Then corrupted matter issues forth, and there is a sinuous ulcer.</P>
<P>The less intelligent imagine, that this corruption proceeds from the use of <HI>hem∣lock:</HI> although upon the continued use of it in the same case, whether internal or external, perfect health often ensues.</P>
<P>I have sometimes seen certain <HI>scirrhuses</HI> in the glands dissolved by the use of <HI>hem∣lock,</HI> but new ones appeared in other parts.</P>
<P>That seemed strange: but the sick al∣ways found themselves well in other re∣spects; so that I continued the same re∣medy, and cured the patients.</P>
<P>Such things never frighten the skilful: and therefore we ought not immediately to change the medicine.</P>
<P>In diet, farinaceous unfermented sub∣stances are to be avoided; and likewise too acrid spices.</P>
<P>Acids are allowed for a condiment; but when they are too predominant, they are not so proper.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
<P>Good wine does not hurt those, who are used to it.</P>
<P>Friction, or great motion, in the part affected, generally increase the disease.</P>
<P>It is very conducive to a cure, for the sick to live in a free and open air, and to preserve a chearful and right disposition of mind.</P>
<P>Sadness, melancholy, disturbances of the mind, retard and hinder the cure; occasion new disorders; and often turn a <HI>scirrhus</HI> to a <HI>cancer.</HI></P>
<P>The time in which <HI>hemlock</HI> may cure, and resolve tumors, cannot be determin∣ed.</P>
<P>For sometimes that is soon done, some∣times very slowly.</P>
<P>Nor is the nature of ulcers, tumors, or cancers, always the same.</P>
<P>I gave a woman <HI>hemlock</HI> in a large dose for tumors of the neck, more than two years, without any alteration in the tu∣mors: but as her menses flowed more plentifully, her strength was greater, mind more chearful, and the whole habit of
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>body much better, she desired herself, that I would not deny her those pills.</P>
<P>At length, after two years and a half, the tumors were dissolved, and everything reduced to a natural state.</P>
<P>Nor did the long use of it do any harm.</P>
<P>I have another woman, who took only two grains of <HI>hemlock</HI> in the morning, for a cancer of the breast; and although she was a woman of seventy, there ensued so good and sudden a change, and dimi∣nution of the tumor, that both the by∣standers and myself were astonished.</P>
<P>This woman made urine most plenti∣fully, with much glutinous sediment. But when she abstained one day from <HI>hemlock,</HI> the urine was in a small quantity, and without the sediment.</P>
<P>In diseases about the kidnies, bladder, and urinary passages, <HI>hemlock</HI> sometimes has most excellent effects.</P>
<P>It sometimes cures a retention of urine, and strangury; and often eases pains in making urine, sooner than <HI>opium.</HI></P>
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
<P>Nor is the extract of <HI>hemlock</HI> to be de∣spised, in disorders arising from a stone.</P>
<P>From what hath been said, it appears, that <HI>hemlock</HI> is highly worthy of being tried.</P>
<P>In the mean time I do not affirm, it has any specific virtue; but I expect the mutual aid of good physicians, to establish rules about it.</P>
