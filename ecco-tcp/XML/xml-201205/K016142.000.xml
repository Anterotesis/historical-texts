<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE institution of <HI>Hospitals</HI> in this metropolis for the relief of the <HI>Poor,</HI> afflicted with bodily infirmities, has been, and justly too, esteemed one of the noblest of <HI>Charities:</HI> an <HI>Asylum</HI> this, to succour the distressed, when their afflictions render them incapable of labouring for their daily subsistence; where they receive every indulgence their misfortunes can require: the <HI>Sick</HI> being healed, the <HI>Lame</HI> made sound, and both again rendered fit Members of Society, oftentimes to the joy of a young family opening their mouths for bread, —the fruits of their industry. How laudable such institutions!</P>
<P>From these considerations, great must be the satisfaction of the Benefactors! This is, indeed, in a very essential point, acting up to the tenets of the religion we profess, and following the example of our blessed <HI>Saviour, who went about healing the Sick, and feeding the Poor.</HI></P>
<P>There are, no doubt, many thousand objects equally claiming our compassion, who, from distance of situation, are deprived of the relief. It must give infi∣nite pleasure to every good Christian, to observe such a blessing rendered univer∣sal over this island.</P>
<P>Nothing is more practicable.—May we live to see some humane and public-spirited gentleman take it into consideration, and erect <HI>Hospitals</HI> in every county in <HI>England!</HI> Surely no physical persons, from mercenary views, will object to it! for, if they reflect, they can be no losers in such unhappy patients being taken off their hands, who have not wherewithal to pay them for their trouble.</P>
<P>It will also be the means of having more able practitioners in the country:— A valuable consequence! And, as goodness meets with its own reward, from the experience of those who are appointed to attend the sick, the <HI>Benefactors</HI> themselves may receive a <HI>Benefaction.</HI></P>
<P>In some sea-port towns there are Hospitals, and it is with pleasure to be observed that some few counties have adopted the plan; but in the more inland parts they are greatly wanted, where the inhabitants, though the most laborious, are the most indigent; and consequently, when infirm, true objects of compassion.</P>
<P>Until such time as this meritorious work is become more universal, it is presumed the present design will prove acceptable to the <HI>Benevolent,</HI> as it, in some measure, supplies the defect; at a trifling expence enabling the wealthy, either for their own amusement, or by means of a servant, in the strictest sense of the word, <HI>to render Charity to the Needy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of the Family Physician is, to direct a right use of those medicines which are necessary to be kept in fa∣milies, whose distance from a good practitioner, or any other circumstance, renders an immediate application in sudden illnesses almost impossible, and occasions those delays in trifling complaints, which oftentimes prove of very bad consequence. It has been sound by experience, for want of proper hints and directions in respect to the doses of medicines, several fatal errors have been committed; either from the ignorance of persons themselves, or from being obliged to have recourse, for want of better, to quack medicines, or to the advice of nurses, and such good women, whose greatest skill extends to the making a posset for a sweat, or a plaster for a sore shin.</P>
<P>Those captains of ships whose vessels are too small to allow of carrying a surgeon, and gentlemen whose business may call them to take a long voyage in such small vessels, or to travel by land through unfrequented or poor places, or those who are going to settle in any of his Majesty's plantations, will find a great advantage from being thus enabled, in cases of necessity, to become their own physicians; and we often see that Nature, with a little assistance, will free the constitution from disorders which are not too deeply rooted, or very malignant in their first attack. I would by no means be understood to pretend, that the medicines I here recommend are infallible in the respective disorders they are prescribed for. They are, for the most part, such only as are to be found in the Dispen∣satory of the College of Physicians: where I have been under a necessity of compounding, I have attended to the practice of the principal physicians in town, and my own experience, in selecting such medicines whose operations are the least dangerous. Thus far, however, I will venture to assert, that, by following these directions, which are plain and easy, and written in a stile fitted
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>to the meanest capacity, <HI>perspicuity being always preferable to elegance in this kind of writing,</HI> the patient may, by applying what is necessary in time, prevent those ills that follow from neglect, which good nursing and a few innocent things might at first remove.</P>
<P>Those who have a knowledge in physic, and do not stand in need of my assistance, will, in the chests, find many useful medicines to be kept at hand; and may extend their practice, by giving me a catalogue of such others as they would chuse to have added.</P>
<P>Ladies and gentlemen, who reside in the country, will hereby be enabled to assist their poor neighbours; which many of them, I doubt not, would take a pleasure in doing, did they but know what to apply.</P>
<P>With each chest of medicines may be had a box of scales and weights; each weight marked distinctly, that any person may at once adjust the proper quantity for a dose.</P>
<P>As many persons may chuse to keep by them what is proper for their own particular complaints, whom it may not suit to have the box complete, I think it necessary to mention, that any of the medicines here recommended may be had separately, or as many of them as agreeable, packed up in lesser boxes for the conveniency of carriage.</P>
<P>For the satisfaction of the public, in order that they may depend upon the medicines, I think it necessary to mention that such compositions as are not made under my immediate inspection are prepared at Apothecaries-Hall.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been suggested to the author, that it would be more eligible to print the Family Physician in a small pocket-volume, the size of his Letters to Married Women, and indeed he had some thoughts of so printing this edition; but, upon mature deliberation, a <HI>quarto</HI> seems best calculated to answer the inten∣tion of this work.</P>
<P>The Family Physician is seldom or never removed from the place where the medicines are kept, which in some measure obviates the objection to a <HI>quarto</HI> volume: add to this the advantage of a larger margin, which enables the reader to make his own notes and observations; and the blank sheets which are now interleaved will further assist the laudable designs of the intelligent and bene∣volent.</P>
<P>The author received the last hint from a person of fashion, who has made a very judicious use of blank leaves, by inserting the histories of remarkable cases opposite to the medicines which effected a cure. Such memorandums may not only prove service∣able to those who take the trouble of making them, but may likewise assist others upon a future occasion.</P>
<P>Experience in physic is the wisest path to tread; and consi∣dering what poor crazy constitutions too many of the human race unhappily sustain, and the various disorders which even the most robust are liable to, no one can be too particular in remarking such innocent remedies as may relieve slight indispositions, and consequently prevent terrible and fatal diseases.</P>
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
<P>Good nursing is a point which has either been too much neglected, or mistaken; nevertheless it is of the first consequence towards the cure of diseases, and the preserving of delicate and feeble constitutions. It is equally so to render advanced age easy and comfortable; and to preserve helpless infants. To speculative minds it must be matter of astonishment to observe the fatality amongst children, which the following table of births and infant∣burials, collected from the bills of mortality, presents for their serious consideration.</P>

<P>The average upon the last ten years.</P>
<P>Thus we see that almost two thirds of the children born in this metropolis and its environs are intirely lost to society: 16283 are, upon the average, the annual births; 10145 the infant∣burials; and, what deserves particular attention, 7987 are cut off before they are two years old, which is more than three fourths of those children who die under five years of age. How ardently therefore is it to be wished that such a fatality could be prevented I —it may be prevented.</P>
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>
<P>Is it not affecting, that so many beings, just entering into life, should be so untimely cut off, to the detriment of society, and the affliction of their weeping mothers? It is, truly, a subject of commiseration, a scene which draws a silent tear from the eye of humanity, and pierces the wounded bosoms of afflicted parents.—Above three fourths of these little innocents fall a sacrifice under two years old. It is well known, that the thrush and watery gripes generally terminate their existence in the early months; and if they survive these maladies, the time of teething too frequently brings on a fatal catastrophe.</P>
<P>Could we but conquer the prejudices of the times, and abolish unnatural and absurd practices; could we but restore that natural and simple method of rearing children, which the all-wise Giver of life has sufficiently pointed out; did we but confine them to that nutriment which HE has prepared for their first state of existence; and consult that reason which He has bestowed upon us to conduct them forwards—all would be well. But alas, indolence and luxury forbid the task! Nevertheless, to the rati∣onal few the following remarks are submitted.</P>
<P>The thrush and watery gripes are, in the author's opi∣nion, artificial diseases, and both of them totally occasioned by improper food; such as all kinds of pap, whether made from flour, bread, or biscuit: they all cause too much fermentation in the stomach, and irritate their tender bowels beyond what nature can support. This appears to him to be the evident cause of the before-mentioned complaints.</P>
<P>When infants are past this period, the danger in cutting their teeth is justly to be feared. This difficulty proceeds altogether from a weakness of constitution, arising from the same first mistaken cause in point of diet: and here a train of dreadful symptoms present themselves; the head, the stomach, the bowels, are all at times terribly affected; a general wasting of the body frequently ensues, and unconquerable fevers prevail, which gene∣rally terminate in convulsions and death.</P>
<PB N="xi" REF="9"/>
<P>To prevent all these unhappy consequences, let us but for a moment reflect that every mother is designed by Nature to foster her own child. If the breast is not to be obtained, cows milk is in general to be preferred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the preservation of children, the author has caused the Milk-pots, which he invented to supply the place of the breast, to be made in the Queen's ware, in order that the poor, who cannot afford to purchase silver ones, may be accom∣modated; and this natural method of feeding infants with milk only will, upon experiment, be found so much more convenient to their nurses, that he hopes to see it generally adopted, whereby the lives of thousands will annually be preserved.
<P>A piece of fine rag should be tied loosely round the spout of the Milk-pot, with which the children will be equally pleased as with the nipple of the breast itself.</P></NOTE> to any kind of sood that can be invented, because it is nearly similar to that which Nature intended. But it would be swelling these pages unnecessarily to enter further upon the management of children, as the treatise promised in the preface to the last edition of this work is now published under the title of LETTERS TO MARRIED WOMEN, which is intended as a companion for the sick chamber and the nursery.</P>
<P>This book is dedicated to the ladies, as a grateful tribute due to them for their tender care; an humble offering meet to be laid at the feet of those, whose compassion and delicacy greatly contribute to render the misfortunes of life supportable, and whose not least endearing province is, where amiable characters may be drawn, the sick chamber and the nursery.</P>
<P>It would be ungrateful in the author not to acknowledge the candour with which the public have been pleased to receive that little volume, although it contains some doctrines repugnant to the present opinions. With a view then to promote the happiness and comfort of his fellow-creatures, and to preserve helpless infants from their present almost certain death, he begs leave to recom∣mend the perusal of those Letters to such as are likely to have a young family; and also to those whose duty may require their
<PB N="xii" REF="10"/>attendance in a sick chamber, and likewise to invalids. They will most assuredly find their account in attending to the maxims there laid down, which are evident to common sense, and the result of an assiduous attention to the duties of his profession; and it may with truth be added, that they have the further sanction of many years successful experience.</P>

<HEAD>ON DIET.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the physician, by means of medicines, has subdued a disease, unless the patient is put upon a proper method of diet, exercise, &amp;c. to prevent a relapse, his work is often∣times in vain. A few observations upon food, to enable persons, in some measure, to judge for themselves of the fit or unfit, will, I trust, prove acceptable; as physic and good nursing ought ever to go hand in hand. My reader will remember I am giving directions to invalids; the glutton will not be satisfied with my meal, neither will the epicure relish my dishes. Yet I would wish this friendly caution to be attended to even by the vaunters of health; place not too much confidence in the supposed strength of a good constitution, one night's debauch may too late convince you—you are mistaken.</P>
<P>First, with respect to Vegetables. Those who would wish to live free from burning fevers, and escape the rage of inflammatory disorders, particularly if their constitutions have been already shaken by such complaints, cannot use them too plentifully; those whose stomachs are weakened by disease, will find the tender vegetable diet frees them from the oppressive labour, that slted meats require to make them fit for nourishment: on the contrary,
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>where the constitution is subject to gouty complaints, and particu∣larly if the stomach has been affected by frequent spasms, such persons must be exceedingly cautious in the use or vegetables, especially at the time the stomach is disordered. One gross mis∣take which we lie under I cannot pass by unnoticed; I mean the pernicious practice of eating pepper with such food, and it is still worse if it be not finely powdered, which is generally the case; gouty persons who plead this necessity, would do better to avoid vegetables; and the common argument in vindication of its supposed excellency is, that it prevents vegetables from colick∣ing. I am well convinced, and speak from experience, that it is often-times the reason why vegetables occasion the colic, which might clearly be demonstrated: but it is not my business here to enter into arguments; all that I mean, is to give some useful hints to those who find it necessary to nurse themselves, and to correct some common errors in our method of living. Thus far I grant, if the man who has been long accustomed to high∣seasoned soups, rich wines, and cordial liquors, was of a sudden to change his diet to melons and cucumbers, he would very proba∣bly feel some disagreeable effects from it: but even when the appetite has been many years pampered, and the body accus∣tomed to heating food; yet, by degrees, with a prudent regu∣lation, step by step, the method of living may be again changed to the more wholesome and cooling diet. This is a piece of advice well worthy of notice, for in many constitutional disorders it is absolutely necessary to be complied with. Do not mistake me, I am far from thinking it needful for every one who does not boast a good state of health to submit himself intirely to a vege∣table and milk diet; on the contrary, I am truly sensible that a moderate use of flesh is far from being unwholesome; nay, it is even necessary for some delicate constitutions, and for those who use much exercise, or are required to labour. It is not the prudent use, but the abuse of these things I mean to caution you against.</P>
<P>Of vegetables; the turnip, parsnip, potatoe, are very good; fruits, and fruit-pies, sallads of all kinds, and pot-herbs, are wholesome; which I would recommend to most persons, and in
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>a particular manner to the young and growing, and to those who have craving appetites, because such food will prevent them eat∣ing too large a quantity of flesh; and these vegetables being easy of digestion; after a full meal pass off quickly, and leave the sto∣mach more at liberty to exert its force upon that aliment which requires so much more time and labour to digest.</P>
<P>I come next to speak of Animal-food. One general rule, which seldom should be transgressed by the infirm, I must beg leave to lay down: Never eat flesh more than once a day, and that at noon. The plain roast and boiled, whether butchers meat or poultry, is far preferable to made-dishes; there is danger to be dreaded, not only from the noxious qualities of the ingredients used to pre∣pare such kitchen poisons, but also from the quantities which are devoured of them; for these savory scents and tastes so quicken the appetite, that people gorge themselves, and regard not the dictates of nature, ever to be observed, and which, if attended to, will always inform us when the stomach has received a sufficient supply. Animal-food, which has been any considerable time in salt, becomes hard, and requires more force to break and digest it, proper for nourishment, than weak stomachs are capable of ex∣erting; consequently, salted beef, pork, and such-like things, are improper for children, invalids, and aged persons. Notwith∣standing what I have said, salt is very wholesome to be eaten with flesh; and, in some measure, necessary. The stimulus which salt gives to the coats of the stomach, makes them exert their power with greater force upon the food; and, of course, helps digestion:—hence, though salted meats are improper, it is from the effect which salt has upon flesh that lies long in it; in render∣ing it hard, and unfit for nourishment; not the salt itself, that is hurtful. Broths of all kinds, which are not seasoned, are whole∣some; broths contain the juices of the flesh they are made from, which is the part proper for nourishment: —hence, although your made, high-seasoned gravies are to be avoided, those gravies which run out of flesh upon cutting it after it is brought to table, are
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>good and nourishing, because they are nothing more than the juices of the meat.</P>
<P>FISH in general are good, particularly shell-fish; but let us re∣member, that by stewing them with high-seasoned gravies, and such-like arts, they, though innocent in their nature, may be rendered as formidable poisons as your ragoes, &amp;c.—witness the sacrifices made to health at a turtle-feast.</P>
<P>MILK is a valuable food indeed! this requires little or no labour from the stomach; it has already passed through such strainers, as render it a kind and wholesome nourishment. This caution I must give, because custom has made it almost a general practice,—never eat milk with acid fruits—reason tells us it is wrong: codlings and milk or cream, strawberries, rasberries, &amp;c. are highly improper to be eaten together; for, by mixing these acid fruits with the milk, it is the most likely method to make it curdle too hastily in the stomach; of which every one who will give himself time to think must be convinced. Almost all the kitchen preparations of milk are wholesome, such as custards, white-pots, blamange, &amp;c. Much indeed might be said upon this head; but as it is treated at large in my Letters to Married Women, I shall beg leave to refer my readers to them, especially those who are desirous of knowing the nature and properties of milk, and of understanding its superior excellence. It is a nutriment the most simple, yet the most perfect. It requires no labour from the digestive faculties, yet fully possesses every principle of nourishment, to give strength to infants, and health to the infirm. Would to God that this natural and salubrious diet was more particularly attended to! One thing, however, let me observe; a little salt being sprinkled into milk will often∣times prevent its curdling too hastily upon the stomach, where it meets with an acidity, and is particularly to be recommended for children; in general, milk is best without boiling; if it purges, it must be boiled. You will find an excellent method of using it in the directions for giving salop in the Family Phy∣sician.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
<P>With respect to Liquids.—It would take up too much time to enter upon them here.—We are, however, too fond of acidu∣lated liquors, especially in sick chambers. The doctrine of acids, in my opinion, has been carried to an extravagant length. I mean to caution the reader against too free an use of them; and as it is im∣possible to discuss this point at present, let your own observations direct you with regard to your general plan, and abide by such liquors as best agree with your constitution. I shall conclude this head with a few remarks upon eggs.—Eggs are a fine food for weak stomachs, but our method of eating them is very erro∣neous:—they certainly afford much nourishment, and that without labour to the stomach; but if they are heated so as to set the yolk, they will never properly digest. Some time since I attended a gentleman who was troubled with a vomiting and purging, and notwithstanding the usual remedies were applied, the disorder continued very violent for ten days:—he had taken a gentle puke at the beginning of the complaint; but finding it would not submit to the medicines afterwards given, it plainly appeared to me the cause of the disorder was still in the stomach, and so it proved; for, upon another vomit being administered, a large quantity of undigested egg came off his stomach, which, upon recollection, he remembered to have eaten two days before he was ill, a circumstance that escaped his memory at the time I first attended him, and, upon its coming away, the disorder left him. This remarkable instance led me to reflect upon the nature of eggs,—and ever after made me careful, when I recom∣mended them, to give a strict charge that they were not boiled hard; and, indeed, the method I have found most successful, where patients have been much emaciated, is the following— Take a new-laid egg, and beat it in a bason as you would do to make a pudding; then add half a glass of madeira, mountain, or mead, to it, and let it be thus taken, with or without a bit of bread; by this means it is rendered palatable, sits easy on the stomach, and will surely turn to nourishment:—several patients to whom I have recommended eggs, that have not been able to
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>keep any other nourishment, have, in this manner, eaten one, two, and, sometimes, three eggs in a day, which for a consi∣derable time have been their only support.</P>
<P>From these hints, I think it no difficult matter for those who are in an indifferent state of health to find out a method of diet suitable to their own constitutions; and it is a just observation, that every man at the age of forty, with respect to himself, is either a fool or a physician.</P>

<HEAD>ASTHMATIC TINCTURE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS tincture is of use in a difficulty of breathing, or tightness across the breast, and likewise for short coughs, particularly if brought on by cold north∣easterly winds, which frequently affect the breast, sides, and lungs: it allays the cough, opens the chest, and loosens the phlegm, so that it easily comes away; and also frees the pores of the skin which have been shut up by the winds.</P>
<P>It may be taken as often as occasion requires, from thirty to sixty or eighty drops, in a little<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every medicine here referred to is digested alphabetically.</NOTE> pectoral drink or barley water, with which you should dilute plentifully, drinking it of the same heat as you would a dish of tea.</P>

<HEAD>ASTRINGENT ELECTARY.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER be too hasty in the use of this electary; it is often found that a purging is the means made use of by Nature to carry off other complaints, or to free the body from bad humours, which might in time bring on disorders; now, by stopping this wholesome drain too soon, these bad humours may be thrown back into the blood, and produce the worst consequences: therefore you will
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>seldom or never err, by suffering the purging, if not over violent, to continue two or three days; at the end of that time, should you find the patient weakened by it, or that it is really a disorder itself, and not a cure for other disorders, then you may give a dose or two of rhubarb, and afterwards proceed to the use of the electary: by these means you will cleanse the stomach and bowels, and get rid of the complaint without any farther trouble.</P>
<P>Fluxes, which sea-faring persons are subject to, are to be treated much in the same manner; but be very careful to cleanse the bowels first.</P>
<P>Some of my friends, who have been many years accustomed to the sea, recommend the purging apozem before the use of astrin∣gents: they say it cools the body, and carries off every thing which is disagreeable to the bowels, better than rhubarb, or any other purge. After having cleansed the stomach and bowels of the filth which occasioned the disorder, by the one or other of these means, you will find ipecacuanha, given with the astringent electary in very small quantities, viz. from half a grain to one or two grains, of infinite service; to which likewise a few drops of laudanum may occasionally be added, but this should be practised with caution, and not till the astringent electary has been first tried; and in desperate cases you will have the satisfaction to find the method here recommended will seldom, if ever, fail of success.</P>

<P>THE febrifuge quality of this bark, and its peculiar efficacy in curing agues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Intermittent fevers of every kind, with regard to the intention of cure, must be treated in the same manner as agues; the cold fit being rather accidental, than essential to this disease.</NOTE> and intermittent fevers, is now universally known; yet a too hasty use of it oftentimes proves prejudicial, a remittent or continual fever being the consequence. You will seldom or never err, by giving a vomit first, and, if the sick be of a full habit of body, you may also purge with safety; you will act more prudently by waiting till they have had four or five ague fits before you throw in the bark, giving a salt of wormwood draught once in six or eight hours, which will make the fits more regular, and prepare the blood for the bark. You should begin when the fever is gone intirely off, and give at least one ounce before you expect it to return<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In low fenny countries, where the atmosphere is moist and foggy, it is some∣times necessary to give one ounce and a half of bark between the fits, but in gene∣ral an ounce is sufficient.</NOTE>; half a dram, two scruples, or a dram may be given for a dose, as the stomach will bear it; the less you administer at a time the more frequently it must be repeated; for, unless you get the whole quantity down within the time, you do nothing.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>
<P>The fit being put by, a second ounce should be taken in the like small doses within the three following days, at the distance of about six or eight hours; the patient may now rest six days, unless signs of the ague's return require the bark to be repeated sooner, when a third ounce is to be taken in like manner, a dose every six or eight hours; another week being elapsed, a fourth ounce is also to be administered; when you may take your leave of them, and be pretty well assured they will not be subject to a return.</P>
<P>The common mixture to give it in, may be made of three quarters of a pint of spring water, and a quarter of a pint of good French brandy, sweetened with a bit of sugar, a tea-cupful of which should be taken with each dose; mix the powder in a little of it, and drink the remainder after it.</P>
<P>If it purges, which is oftentimes the case, it should be given in a little cinnamon tea; should not that answer, two, three, or four drops of laudanum must be added to each dose.</P>
<P>If, on the contrary, the bark should bind, a few grains of rhu∣barb may be given with each dose as long as you see necessary.</P>
<P>Above the age of fourteen it will require this quantity to cure the ague, under these years your judgment must direct you to decrease it; the manner of giving it must be exactly the same.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>BARK DECOCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WE frequently, and with success, for children, and those of delicate constitutions, boil bruised bark a long while in water, and give the strained liquor instead of the powder in substance; the proportion is, an ounce in two or three pints of water, till you can pour off one. This method of administering the bark is, in my opinion, always to be preferred to the powder when pati∣ents are much reduced in their strength. In agues and intermittent fevers this decoction must be given to bear a proportion to the quantity of bark before ordered, and a tea-spoonful or two of brandy may be added to each dose. This preparation will fre∣quently

<P>TAKE of bark, grosly powdered, two ounces, the yellow peel of two Seville oranges, and one nutmeg grated; pour three pints of old rough red port upon these ingredients; let them stand by a gentle fire, in a large bottle, for three or four days, shaking it frequently; then pour off a wine-glassful of the clear liquor at the time you take it, which should be morning, noon, and night; when you have taken one half, another pint of wine may be added, and kept upon the ingredients till the whole is taken, at least for ten days or a fortnight. A few drops of elixir of vitriol two or three times a day with the wine, or mixed in a glass of water, may be also serviceable in agues, and feverish complaints, such as hectic heats, and the like.</P>

<P>IS of late years brought into much esteem in England; it is of a restorative and strengthening quality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salop, like most other things for which there is a large demand, to enable the trader to sell cheap, is very frequently much adulterated. I am afraid the greatest part of what is commonly sold for powder of salop, will be found to have in it a considerable quantity of starch and gum arabic, which ought to put persons upon their guard where they purchase it; for, although the virtues of the true are unde∣niable, the adulterated must fall short of its excellency, and the false in appearance, if artfully managed, will deceive very good judges.</NOTE>; many ladies, whom I have had the honour to recommend it to, of tender constitutions, where tea has been found to prey over-much upon a weak stomach, and where more nourishment has been necessary than they received from their ordinary food, eat it in a morning for breakfast; and I must confess it would much please me to see it more universally received, particularly by those who are subject to nervous com∣plaints, being in its own nature very strengthening, easy of diges∣tion, and, in the manner here recommended, affords a great deal of nourishment in an impoverished state of blood; therefore the properest food that can be received after a severe fit of sickness, whereby the patient is much weakened.</P>
<P>The common way of preparing it is with water, and a glass of wine added to it, but the method I think far preferable is this:</P>
<PB N="27" REF="37"/>
<P>Boil half a pint of milk with as much water; while it is in a boiling state, let two tea-spoonfuls of the powder of salop, first mixed in a bason with a spoonful or two of cold water, be thrown into it; after it has simmered a minute or two, stirring it the while, you will find the whole of a smooth creamy consistence; a bit of sugar, and a little nutmeg may be added to make it pala∣table. Those whom milk is apt to render costive, should mix the salop with the water alone as above directed, and add the milk to it after it is taken from the fire.</P>

<HEAD>SALT OF WORMWOOD DRAUGHT.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE a scruple of salt of wormwood, pour upon it by little and little fresh lemon-juice, till it has done fermenting and tastes quite insipid; about one large spoonful is sufficient; then add a little fine sugar to make it palatable; about a wine-glass of spring or barley water, and a pap-spoonful of cinnamon water, makes a most plea∣sant draught.</P>
<P>Above the age of fourteen, it may be given once in six or eight hours; in any little feverish complaints, sickness at stomach, watch∣ings, parched dryness of the mouth, and such-like ills, and is often of service with the fever powder. From seven to fourteen years, half a draught is sufficient; under that age still decrease the quantity.</P>
<P>When the fever powder increases any of the evacuations over much, give the powder only once or twice in the twenty-four hours, and the salt of wormwood draught every six hours; in this case four or five drops of laudanum may with propriety be added to the draught, especially if the patient complains of pain or sickness.</P>

<HEAD>ON BLEEDING.</HEAD>
<P>I RATHER chuse to mention the complaints in which bleeding is recommended under this general head, than with the medi∣cines for the respective disorders, because it may naturally be sup∣posed that assistance cannot always be procured; for which reason, directing to bleed before the use of the medicines, in cases where it might prove serviceable, may be a means of preventing the administering those remedies, which, taken in time, will frequently alone remove the complaints. Besides, I would not wish the unskilful to be too free with the lancet, as an injudicious evacuation of blood may be succeeded with very bad conse∣quences. My intention through the whole, as I observed in the preface, being no other than to supply families with a few use∣ful remedies for slight indispositions, by which they may frequently prevent tedious illnesses,—not to put the unexperienced upon trifling with themselves, or wantonly sporting with human blood, when patients are really ill, and can have proper advice.</P>
<P>The best authors advise blood to be taken away in the begin∣ning of fevers, when there is a strong, quick pulse, the eyes red and fiery, with great heat and thirst; but never when they are in the decline, as, from being inflammatory, they are often at this period degenerated into the nervous kind, when the chief of the affair is to be managed by the frequent application of blisters.</P>
<P>In asthmatical complaints, if the patient be of a full habit of body.</P>
<P>In coughs, if the pulse is quick and full, with an oppression at the breast, or difficulty in breathing.</P>
<P>In colics, where the pain is violent, the bowels inflamed, and no stools.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="47"/>
<P>In fits, if the spirits are hurried and overpowered, and the patient full of blood.</P>
<P>In swimmings, dizziness, and pains of the head.</P>
<P>In stitches, and pleuritic disorders of the side and breast, parti∣cularly if it gives pain to take a deep breath.</P>
<P>In sore throats, where there is a strong, quick pulse, and the throat greatly swelled and inflamed.</P>
<P>For the piles it is sometimes thought serviceable; as likewise in female obstructions, and frequently in rheumatic complaints; in apoplectic disorders, a dysentery or bloody-flux, and irksome heat of the bowels; for the hooping cough, particularly if of a full habit of body, and the phlegm which is brought up appears streaked with blood; in all which cases, the quantity taken away must be proportioned to the age of the patient, and the violence of the complaint.</P>
<P>Bleeding again is sometimes directed in large abscesses or swel∣lings, where the heat and pain is immoderate; for, in these cases, by drawing blood, it is supposed that the matter is more easily and speedily brought to ripen, and, by that means, the body more effectually freed from its distempers.</P>
<P>In a word, wherever prevail sore eyes, sciatica or hip-gout, a dry husky cough, an head-ach, pains of the womb or of the bladder, dry gripes, strangury, gravel, pain from the stone, violent bleed∣ings of the nose, ears, or other parts, an inveterate scorbutical itch, and the like, opening a vein is esteemed of peculiar service; but in dropsies, a jaundice, the gout, and all illnesses occasioned by a relaxed state of body, an impoverished blood, or too great weakness of the vessels, you must seek relief from the medicines recom∣mended in this little manual, and not, by an abrupt and prepos∣terous use of bleeding, increase the disorder, and ruin the health of the patient and your own reputation.</P>
<P>The reader will be pleased to understand, that what has been said concerning the taking away blood is in conformity to the most respectable authorities, and the present practice. I will now beg leave to add my own opinion, <HI>that it would be happy for mankind if a lancet had never been invented.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ON THE APPLICATION OF BLISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>TO the cautions here laid down, with respect to bleeding, I shall add a word or two concerning the application of blisters.</P>
<P>The most excellent remedy may be prostituted by an inconside∣rate, rash, and foolish practice; which, it is plain, oftentimes happens with regard to blisters, by ordering them indiscrimi∣nately in all fevers, and without distinction in any time of the distemper, which can only be the effect of ignorance.</P>
<P>Therefore, before we resolve on an expedient of this nature, it will be convenient to consider whether the fever be of the in∣flammatory or nervous kind; if of the former, instead of blistering the lancet is generally used, and a mild cooling regimen set on foot, as already directed; this will moderate the heat of the blood, and, by degrees, restore it to its due temper. On the other hand, in fevers of the nervous class, where the symptoms are quite diffe∣rent, the pulse being low and weak, the spirits almost spent, and the eyes, instead of appearing sparkling, red and fiery, grown quite dim, we ought, by all means, to make use of blisters, and that freely.</P>
<P>They are oftentimes proper in paralytic and nervous complaints, as likewise in rheumatic pains and pleurisies, in which cases a blis∣ter applied immediately upon the part affected frequently affords great relief; and in a variety of other cases they are of infinite service: but then regard must be paid to the state of the patient's blood; for, if a full, quick pulse, great heat, thirst, and the other
<PB N="39" REF="49"/>symptoms of an inflammatory fever attend upon the disorders, the fever must first be conquered, and afterwards, if necessity requires it, let blisters be applied. Should they cause a strangury, which will sometimes be the case, give the patient plentifully of marsh∣mallow drink, or barley water with a little gum arabic dissolved in it; or if there is a purging, which you would wish to be stopped, of the hartshorn drink; and this inconvenience will soon be remedied.</P>
<P>In regard to the management of blisters, the plaster should be spread upon a piece of an old glove, and bound on to the part intended; after twenty-four hours, the strength of the flies being pretty well spent, you may remove the blister, and, if you cannot procure the proper dressings, a little Turner's cerate, spread upon a piece of fine rag, may supply its place.</P>
<P>Should any blisters appear unbroken, snip them with a pair of scissars; if they give violent pain, this may be done when the plaster has been applied only twelve hours; when, by discharging the water, and laying it smoothly on again, you ease the patient, and give the blister an opportunity of acting more effectually.</P>
<P>Thus much has been advanced in conformity to the present practice, in which I have endeavoured to assist the intelligent reader, by familiar language, to form clear ideas of the various diseases treated of in this book. The cure of diseases is certainly a laudable and noble study. It is a science which dignifies human nature: many important truths have been illustrated both by the antients, and some modern writers—<HI>yet much remains to be known:</HI> which future experience and accurate observation may possibly discover. Permit me to say that, in my humble station, I have reaped the advantage of both; and if a distant period should afford me leisure regularly to digest my thoughts upon the cura∣tive intention of diseases, I shall not hesitate to promulge doctrines, which are, perhaps, at this time not generally understood: and if I continue to be so happy as to recommend them by a success∣ful practice, I hope to live to see my opinions generally adopted by medical practitioners, for the good of this country, and the benefit of the world in general.</P>

<HEAD><HI>This Day is also Published, by the same</HI> AUTHOR, The THIRD EDITION, Price bound 3 s. 6d. LETTERS TO MARRIED WOMEN, Upon several important Female Duties, especially those of the Nursery and Sick Chamber, and concerning aged Parents: The real Benefits of a Milk Diet are demonstrated, with particular Cautions to Invalids.</HEAD>
<P>These Letters are principally addressed to those Ladies who already have, or are likely to have children, and they will do well to attend to them; as thousands of little innocents are annually sacrificed to vulgar errors, which a moment's reflection would explode. Those errors are here exposed, and a natural and easy method of rearing children, approved by experience, is laid down. It necessarily follows, that such precautions as are proper for the management of a feeble infant-state, should be equally attended to, when the digestive powers are weakened by disease; and also that the slow progressive steps by which we mount into life, are the safest and best paths to descend peaceably into the grave.</P>
