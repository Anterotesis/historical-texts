<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Observations and Complaints of the ill State and Male-Practice of Physick in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> were at first intended to appear in another Dress; and by way of Appeal to our neighbour∣ing Nations, where that noble and neces∣sary Art is said to be exercised in a more regular and beneficial manner. For By∣standers, who are not heated by Animo∣sities and personal Reflections, who are not interested in a Debate, and have no Party-Quarrel to maintain, are the fit∣test Persons to examine and determine the Reasonableness of the Cause; and as their Passions are calmer and more mode∣rate, so their Decisions are likely to be more just and equal, and agreeable to Truth, than the Sentiments of those Peo∣ple, who are more nearly concerned. But when I considered, that all national
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>Grievances, (and certainly the Abuse of this excellent Faculty is a very great <HI>one!</HI>) ought rather to be corrected at home, than exposed abroad; that the Mismanagement and Dishonesty of <HI>ma∣ny</HI> shou'd not procure the Condemnation of <HI>all;</HI> and Offenders only shou'd suffer; and that they too could not be <HI>legally</HI> re∣strained and punished, but by the Legi∣slative Powers; I had Thoughts of ad∣dressing them to a Worthy Patriot, who might, in Parliament, have procured a Redress of as many of them at least, as the Wisdom of the Nation might think worth their Cognizance. Yet consider∣ing how far that August Assembly is em∣barrass'd and engaged in the more ardu∣ous and difficult Affairs of the Nation, and likewise the Temper and Taste of my intended Patron; the one so exquisite and distinguishing, that scarce a Word could drop from the Pen without the Terror of Reprehension; and the other so moderated, that had I attempted to make way for a favourable Reception by (the common Method in Dedications) re∣citing but few of his real Accomplish∣ments, it wou'd scarce have been looked upon as a just Encomium. I resolved at length therefore to adventure into a censorious World these rude Papers, containing little else but Matters of Fact as naked Truths, without any Ʋmbrage
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>or Defence; and think, these Difficul∣ties presenting, the giving my Reasons for making no Dedication, is Dedication enough. For in all Disquisitions about Truth, 'tis not the Greatness, the Au∣thority, and Weight of the Advocate, but of his Arguments and Proofs, that is the Point to be minded; and the more plain and unadorned his Discourse is, the greater Air of Veracity it hath. For which reason I shall no more be at the pains to make any Apology for the loose Composition and careless Diction of this Pamphlet, than I shall think my self obliged to answer the unreasonable Cavils, and loud Clamours that may be raised by self-interested and dishonest Men against it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons of this Work. 1st.</NOTE> Thinking that I shall have sufficiently discharged my <HI>Consci∣ence,</HI> in detecting their Dishonesty; and that it is not in their Power to say much in their own Vindication, without ex∣posing more of their own Disingenuity and Baseness, to the Judicious especially, and discerning Part of Mankind. Nei∣ther shall I think it any Reflection, that others have offered the same Things in a better manner; but rather as a Confir∣mation of what I say; that makes what I here deliver, appear with the greater Force of Evidence.</P>
<P>Though it must be acknowledged, that Matters go not so well with the World,
<PB N="vj" REF="7"/>as that most Voices shou'd be on the best Side; and such Persons as are Slaves to their Lusts, indolent, ignorant and cre∣dulous, take up with the Opinions and Ways in fashion without much Exami∣nation; and thus are easily led on to their own Disadvantage, and sometimes De∣struction, by Men of corrupt Minds, whose sole Advantage lies in Cheat and Imposition, and who, of consequence, have also a burning Hatred to plain, open, and fair Dealing, and to the Truth: and from whom her strictest Fol∣lowers must expect to meet with the se∣verest Ʋsage. The Truths even of the Holy Gospel have generally been on the suffering Side. And when I see those, promulged for the Salvation of Souls, have met with such bad Treatment, how can I expect that these, of less Impor∣tance, calculated only for the Safety of the Body, shou'd find a more gracious Reception?</P>
<P>But if I am guilty of any Breach of good Manners, in meddling with other Mens Morals, Means of living, and In∣terests, I am sorry for it. And if in my Enquiries I have been any way im∣posed upon, and led into Mistakes; or have been too impertinent and tedious, too clamorous and severe, I humbly beg pardon, and submit to the Correction of my legal Superiors, assuring them,
<PB N="vij" REF="8"/>that I speak no Falshoods, to the best of my Ʋnderstanding and Knowledge; and as I had no Pleasure in finding out, so I have no Profit in publishing the fol∣lowing Disorders; which indeed have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d.</NOTE> of long time, been no Secrets to Multi∣tudes of suffering People, who have hi∣therto complained in vain, and groan under unsufferable Oppressions that they wou'd gladly get rid of, if they knew where or how they could be relieved, and which have been discovered by many worthy Physicians.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d.</NOTE> But then they have touched these Sores too tenderly; either fearing too much the Resentment of those People, who would not have them healed; or, finding it a Difficulty to set Men <HI>right,</HI> who go <HI>wrong</HI> out of Choice and Interest, surmounting all their Endeavours; and that I have no Ends in giving myself and others this Trouble, but what are just and ho∣nest, and designed sincerely for the com∣mon Good and Welfare of Mankind.</P>
<P>And as true Honesty, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th.</NOTE> Inte∣grity of Heart and Life, is the first, the chief, and fundamental Point of true Wisdom; so it is likewise, when apply'd to our Occupations and Professions, Trade and Commerce; the only sure Basis there∣of, the most preferable thing, and to be regarded above Gain. On the contrary; As all unaccountable Ways of Live∣lihood,
<PB N="viij" REF="9"/>all Extortion and unreasonable Profit, are certainly dishonest; so more especially when the Life and Health, as well as the Estate of our Neighbour is endanger'd thereby, they become ob∣noxious, and ought to be condemned and rejected as intolerable. And, as saith a grave and learned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et si ad honestatem nati sumus, ea aut sola expe∣tenda est, aut certe omni pondere gravior est haben∣da. <HI>Tull.</HI></NOTE> Author, <Q>"There are just Reasons, why Men that are notorious for any Vice or Crime shou'd be exposed and represented as they de∣serve, not only to prevent others from falling into their Hands, and suffer∣ing by their Wickedness; but that they may undergo that Shame and Re∣proach, which ever must be the Por∣tion of ill Men".</Q></P>
<P>To pretend to put a stop to male Pra∣ctice in Physick, is a bold Ʋndertaking: and notwithstanding it may, for these Reasons, appear very necessary and com∣mendable to some; yet as it may be thought by a prevailing Majority, to proceed rather from Spite or Disgust than Discretion, it may chance to ruin him that will he so hardy as to attempt it.</P>
<P>But since I am induced to lay open the Faults and Frauds of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th.</NOTE> for the sake of
<PB N="ix" REF="10"/>Justice and Charity itself; let the E∣vent be what it will, I resolve to per∣severe in this honest Disquisition, tho' I gain nothing thereby, but that Peace of Mind, that proceeds necessarily from the Reflection that I have done my Du∣ty.</P>
<P>The most innocent, as well as the most serviceable and best Parts of a Man's Life, are frequently misunderstood, and highly censured. Yet, because I know my Intentions are founded upon a good Bottom, I may still hope that they will discover themselves, and be justified by all in the Conclusion: Being satisfied that what I shall deliver hath Truth on its Side, (so far as I am able to come at the Knowledge thereof) which is the best Patron; and under that Protection I leave it.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections answered.</NOTE><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING gone thus far by way of Preface, I still find that I am obliged to remove an Objection or two that lye against myself, before I proceed far in those that I shall offer against the Men that abuse this Noble Science; and likewise to premise something of the Difficulty to attain a competent Knowledge in it. There are some inquisitive People, who will needs know how I came by these dismal, ill-natured Accounts of the Male-Administration of Phy∣sick? To whom I reply: Dear-bought Expe∣rience, the most faithful Informer, hath for the most part (tho' I must acknowledge some
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>things are taken upon Trust and Narrative; but then of such Persons, whose Insight and Veracity I esteemed altogether equal to my own Knowledge) hath, I say, led me into these sad Secrets. For being a Piece of a Phy∣sician myself, who have had a liberal Educa∣tion in one of our own celebrated Universi∣ties, and performed (tho' perfunctorily I must confess with Compunction) all the Exercises there required to be done for the last Degree that a Student can be honoured with in that Academy; who have spent some Years in the Wholesale Apothecaries Shops in <HI>London,</HI> where I had an Opportunity of examining in∣to their adulterate and deadly Compositions, of seeing too many of their unfaithful Dis∣pensations; and have been a Practitioner of above twenty Years standing, (for some time in the Country, but for the major Part) in this grand Metropolis, and consequently could not well avoid being not only Ear, but more frequently an Eye-witness of those <HI>horrid Practices,</HI> (as <HI>one</HI> ingenuous and faithful Apo∣thecary, who could hardly ever be prevail'd upon to leave his proper Business in his Shop, to intrude into the sick Chambers, was used to call them) that introduce such vast Swarms of impudent Empiricks into Credit with the unthinking Multitude, and unwary People, and discourage and disgrace the true Physici∣ans, as well as deprive them of their just Rights, and lawful Emoluments.</P>
<P>And here I need not descend to Particu∣lars; this whole Discourse being intende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against these ignorant Pretenders to this learn¦ed Art in general, some of their Disqualifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cations will necessarily occur in every Para¦graph: But for Shew of some Method, I chus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>to speak to the Formalist in the first place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Forma∣list condemned.</NOTE> And it is easy to demonstrate, that he, who is merely such, and that takes all for granted that he finds recommended to him by Authors,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nemo ex libris evasit artifex.</NOTE> and <HI>practises</HI> by their Schemes, and can use no other than their Prescriptions, will never make any thing on't, never be a good and ho∣nest Physician. To what Errors do Men ex∣pose themselves through Prejudice? and to how many more through a blind Submission to a reputed Authority? Doth not every Day's Experience convince us, that the same Re∣medy applied to the same Disease may be suc∣cessful in some Constitutions, and fatal in others<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Illud ignorari non opertet, quòd non minibus aegris eadem auxilia conveniunt: non omnibus, etiam in similibus casibus optulantur. <HI>Cels.</HI></NOTE>? This deserves to be insisted on more at large in our present Subject; which, as I I doubt it will not prove very entertaining, I shall endeavour to contract into as narrow a Compass as may be.</P>
<P>Such <HI>Practicers</HI> then, it is to be suspected, are more frequently obliged to bring the Sym∣ptoms of Diseases to their Receipts, than ac∣commodate their Receipts to the Diseases. Such a Medicine-monger, <HI>qui medicinam ab usu tantùm &amp; experimentis novit &amp; tractat, non ex causis naturalibus;</HI> who fetcheth his Skill therein, not from natural Causes, but from his own injudicious Use of it, and bold Experi∣ments, is justly called by the learned <HI>Celsus</HI> an Empiric. Those who are not really Masters of this Science, but practise barely upon Receipts, and those that have obtained only Notions from Books or Imagination, instead of a true
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>and accurate Information of the Laws of the animal Oeconomy, will ever be perplexed in the Mists of Fancy, and be much more like∣ly to do hurt than good, by putting Nature out of her way by the Force of Ignorance. Such Men have little regard to the Caution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medici est, ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ò, <HI>tutò,</HI> &amp; jocundè curare.</NOTE> given by <HI>Asclepiades,</HI> That it is the Duty of a Physician not only to cure as soon as may be, but to take care that his Medicines are <HI>safe,</HI> as well as palatable; nor to the Admonition of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> That the Physician be perpe∣tually upon his Guard, exert his utmost Skill and Endeavours to do good, and take care that by his wrong Administration nothing of <HI>harm</HI> befal his Patient. 'Tis better to wait, to observe, and give nothing, where there is Cause to doubt, than venture to give what may prove wrong. And it were to be wished, there was not, by the great Numbers of Me∣dicines flung in at random, perhaps to please, or to amuse, (not to mention some less ho∣nourable Ends) more Destruction made, than by Distempers themselves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Honesty ought to be the only Basis and Rule of the Art of Physick.</NOTE>And if any Faculty is so far imperfect in or so much corrupted by those that pra∣ctise it, that a Man must be forced to play little Tricks, and to make wonderful Preten∣ces to those things that are not, and to what he is utterly ignorant of, to support his Credit in his Calling; and must cheat other People not only of their Money, but sometimes of their Lives too, that he may get himself a Liveli∣hood: certainly that Art, and the Followers of it, ought to be banished from amongst Men, to be suppressed as a Cheat and Impo∣sture.
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>For the Good of Mankind, and honest Gain, is the only Bottom (as I have before observed) upon which every Trade and Sci∣ence is set on foot: And he who cannot live honestly, that is, give a just and satisfactory Account how he lives, shou'd not be suffered to <HI>live.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prevertunt homines ea, quae sunt Fundamenta Natureae, cum utilitatem ab Honestate sejungunt. Pretio aut mercede ducuntur — quae sordidissima qui∣dem est ratio &amp; iis, qui câ tenentur, &amp; illis, qui ad eam confugere conantur. <HI>Tul.</HI></NOTE> When Men dissever Profit from Honesty, they subvert the Foundations of the Laws of Nature, and break all the Bands of Society and publick Credit. <HI>Tully</HI> calls this <HI>a most sordid and corrupt way of living,</HI> &amp;c. When our Profession recedes from this Rule, and open, fair Maxims; when it must be car∣ried on by Frauds, and gross Ignorance must be varnished over with Pretences to rare Se∣crets, <HI>Nostrums,</HI> Philosophical Preparations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then we ought presently to suspect and avoid those, that wou'd cheat us of the most dear thing to us in this Life, <HI>our Health,</HI> without being able to give any other Account of their Process, than what is wrapp'd up in such unintelligible <HI>Cant</HI> and <HI>Jargon.</HI> 'Twas long ago the Complaint of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> That because such pass, with those that distinguish no better, for Physicians, on account of their Want of real Accomplishments, the Art, that is of all others most excellent, is brought in∣to Disesteem and Neglect: But yet such, we see, commonly are the most tenacious and secure in their own Ways. And as the Great <HI>Celsus</HI> saith of such, <HI>Verba supecresse, de∣sse medendi scientiam;</HI> how defective soever
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>they may be as to their real Knowledge, they are usually the most talkative and ostentatious, and take all Occasions to decry others of more Knowledge and Sincerity; being as unwil∣ling to introduce Reason into Physick, as some are to admit it into Religion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">'Tis difficult for an honest Physician live.</NOTE>'Tis a needless (as well as a too tedious) Task to recite all that hath been offered on this Head, by conscientions Physicians, in im their own Vindication, and in order to detect such impudent Impostors. And it is a lamen∣table Observation, That a Physician, now a∣days, who hath been regularly educated in one of our famous Universities, and hath given reasonable and legal Tests of his Qualification, hath, after all, his Way to make thro' a vast Crowd, and superior Numbers, who have no other Support but superficial Pretences, back∣ed by consummate Assurance, and all the in∣sinuating Arts of Imposition, received greedi∣ly by an unthinking People. The honest and truly instructed Sons of <HI>Aesculapius</HI> need not have recourse to such Subterfuges: 'They can, it is to be hoped, give a <HI>Rationale</HI> of their Practice.</P>
<P>But the more I consider these things, the more I admire how an Apothecary can com∣mence Physician from the Doctor's Bills that hang upon his File! Yet this prating Mon∣ster is produced every Day, not only in the Country Towns, but the greatest Cities, and Places of Wealth and Concourse, and with Impunity, and most impudently jostles out of place the modest Physician; assuming this ostentatious Motto, <HI>Opiferque per orbem dicor.</HI> For which Presumption he deserves the Fate of <HI>Python</HI> from the Hand of <HI>Apollo.</HI> As if a slight Knowledge (as a learned Gentleman ob∣serves)
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>gathered from a few modern Systems, or by consulting Dispensatories, and perusing their musty Files, or spending some time in Hospitals, wou'd sufficiently qualify a Man to sit upon Life and Death. Whereas no Man's own Experience is sufficient to make him a Master of the Art of Physick: He must take in also the Experience of former Ages, as well as his own. <Q>"I don't see (saith the a∣bove quoted Author) how any honest Man can satisfy himself with a little superficial Inspection into our present Modes of Pra∣ctice, and neglect the antient and best Wri∣ters in our Profession".</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">'Tis difficult to attain to the Art of Heal∣ing; to be a good Physician</NOTE>Tho' it is one of the greatest Difficulties to find out proper and certain Methods of Cure; and this Difficulty that attends the Attain∣ment of a competent Knowledge in the Art of Healing, is surely sufficient to deter any considering and just Man from invading the Offices of it, without regular and cautious Instructions therein; with what abundant Ap∣plication, with what conscientious Circumspe∣ction and Preparation of Mind shou'd we set about the Duties of this sacred Art, when we hear what the great and judicious <HI>Celsus</HI> pro∣nounceth of the Uncertainty of its Rules and Trecepts<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Medicina vix ulla perpetua Praecepta recipit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>? No <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> must pass amongst Physicians. There is no Infallibility in our Science. 'Tis sufficient for us to know Pro∣perties, not Textures; to know the peculiar Attributes, and not the Essence of Things. God reserves these Secrets to himself, and leaves us room to admire. 'Tis enough for
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>us to know the Properties of Bodies, without knowing the Causes of those Properties. Tho' we may search into the Causes without Of∣fence, yet we rarely do it to our Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Do we satisfy our selves when we pretend to reason upon many Phaenomena occuring in natural Philosophy? which agrees, that Qua∣lities or Properties, whether universal, parti∣cular, or occult, may be discovered, tho' their Way of operating cannot be explained by us. And there are certain Textures in Bodies we are absolutely ignorant of, whose Qualities however we are well acquainted with. To instance; those of the Loadstone, Mercury, Opium, and that unparallel'd Specific<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: And the Discovery of it was sent from Hea∣ven.</NOTE> Reme∣dy, as it is deservedly called, the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Who can account for the attra∣ctive Virtue of the Magnet, for the Flux or Tides of the Sea? Who can tell the Use and Nature of the Stars, any more than he can tell the Number of them? Who can ex∣plain how the Accretion and Auction of Plants and Animals are performed? Who can find all the Tubes, and Liquors moving in them, that compose an human Body? And who can tell how the animal and rational Soul are uni∣ted? It must be confessed, we know no far∣ther of the Union between Soul and Body, than that if there be an harmonious Propor∣tion between the Fluids and Solids, our Senses are vigorous; but are disturbed where they fall short of, or exceed the natural Constitu∣tion. As most, if not all the former of these things are beyond the Knowledge of the Phy∣scian,
<PB N="9" REF="19"/>so the Union of the Soul and Body is a Secret the wisest and most devout Divine does not pretend to penetrate, nor to explain the Difficulties that attend it. But that the Body has an Influence upon the Soul, and the Notices and Conceptions of the Understand∣ing have a Tincture from the Matter of which the Body is formed, is manifest. <Q>"I must declare, (saith a very great Man) That I do not find it possible for any Person to give such an exact and satisfactory Account, as might be wished for, either of the Make or Constitution of our Bodies, or of the Disposition and Relation of the inward Parts, or of the Instruments of Nature for the Preservation of the Individual or Spe∣cies, or of the Diseases they are subject to, or of the most proper Methods of Cure".</Q> The more a Man searches into the mechanical Attempts of this kind, the more unsatisfied he will find himself about them; and will find reason to conclude, that we may know enough for our general Direction what to do, but that the secret Causes are so hidden from us, as we have reason to admire the Supreme Artificer in what we know, and to adore him in what we do not know. In short, we know many times that such a thing will have such an Effect, or perhaps that such an Effect is pro∣duced by such a Cause, but the manner <HI>how</HI> we know not, or but grossly: And if such an Hypothesis be true, it is impossible for us to Come at the true Principles of Things, or to see into the Oeconomy of the finest Parts of Nature, and Workings of the first Springs. The internal Constitution of most things, the subtilest Parts of Matter, are hid from us, and our Philosophy dwells only in the Surface of
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>Nature. And here I must say, as St. <HI>Augustin</HI> once did of Purgatory<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ego certè usquead hoc tempus, cum inde sate∣gerem, ad eorum indaginem pervenire non potui.</NOTE><Q>"I could never, notwithstanding great Study, attain to the perfect Knowledge of these things".</Q> Hence we may rightly infer how dubious our Art is.</P>
<P>And I wish we could cure with a <HI>few,</HI> and those <HI>simple Medicines</HI> only; a Cup of cold Water rightly apply'd. And I should esteem myself worth some Notice, if I could establ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but a few Certainties in my Profession for the Good of Mankind, tho' I became poor for my pains in the Discovery. And this ought to be the Aim of every conscientious Physici∣an, who rightly considers the modern Me∣thods of Practice; and that <HI>one of the greates<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Uncertainties and Difficulties</HI> that he mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with, is, how to be secure, that what he or∣ders for the Sick, shall be truly prepared. For tho' he prescribe never so delicate and perti∣nent a Medicine, yet he will find it is in the Apothecaries Power to use one thing for ano∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>Sect.</HI> 14.</NOTE> (and they are very dextrous at finding out <HI>Succedaneums</HI>) and he never the wiser, till he hath purchased his Knowledge and Ex∣perience with the Loss of his Patient, or cer∣tainly of his own Reputation.</P>

And though I have insinuated how dark and uncer∣tain all physical Knowledge is, that the Pro∣fessors thereof oftentimes lose themselves, and wander they know not where; they seek the Depth of natural Causes, the Change of the Elements, the Impressions of the Air, the Motions of the Celestial Bodies, of the Pla∣nets, and their Proportions and Influences; they search the Mines in the Bowels of the Earth, and dive into the Bottom of the Sea; they dissect the Body of Man, look into the Womb, and enquire into the Manner and Causes of his Procreation and Nutriment, Preservation and Decay; follow the Food from the Mouth to the Stomach, and the Chyle from thence to the Lacteal Vessels, and their Infer∣tion into the Veins; they search the Glands, and trace the Arteries and Nerves, that they may know the Vessels, and the Liquids and Fluids moving in them, of which the human Fabrick is composed; that we call Blood, and animal Spirits. And so they go on till they lose themselves, their Senses, all ocular De∣monstrations, and can find nothing but the un∣searchable Works of an Omnipotent Creator. Yet, I say, it is in the first place necessary, that the Student in Physick make himself very well versed in natural Philosophy; for it is generally remarked, <HI>Ubi definit Philosophus, in∣cipit Medicus;</HI> and he that will undertake the Art of Healing, must understand not only the general, but also the particular Subjects there∣of;
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>not only the sound Frame of an human Body, but the Diseases thereof, and those Remedies that are indicated from the Causes and Symptoms of them. Hence we infer, that he must understand Anatomy, which shews him the Figure, Position, and Use of every Part of our Bodies, as they are in their natural State of Health. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Pathology and Aetiology, which treat of the Difference, Causes and Symptoms of all Diseases. <HI>Third∣ly,</HI> Physiology, or the Knowledge of simple Medicines, that are supply'd to us by Nature; and this also sheweth the Strength and Virtue of each Medicament. He must understand Pharmacy, both Galenical and Chymical; he must know Herbs and Drugs, and all the Spa∣gyrical Preparations of them; that by knowing how to mix Simples in a just and right Pro∣portion, he may prepare compound Medicines to supply the Defects of the simple. Thus an expert Physician should not only very well know the containing, but the contained Parts also of an human Body; and be well versed in the Causes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pertiner ad rem omnium Proprietates noscere non credunt posse eum scire quomodo morbos curare con∣veniat, qui unde hi sint ignoret. <HI>Celsus.</HI></NOTE> and Symptoms of all Distem∣pers. He must know the Virtues and Strength of all Medicines, simple and compound, and how to apply them <HI>seasonably,</HI> and in due Pro∣portion. <HI>Hic labor, hoc opus:</HI> An hard Task truly! and enough to discourage the young Student, who may have reason, upon this short View of his tedious Undertaking, to apply the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.

<PB N="13" REF="23"/>the Faculty, who complained that the whole Life of Man was too short a time for his Ac∣complishment in this Art. And hence too we may very justly conclude with the learned <HI>Celsus,</HI> That of all Men living a Physician has need of the highest Wisdom and Conside∣ration: That every thoughtless Animal is by no means capable of the Practice of this noble Art, that is intrusted with the Superinten∣dence over the Health and Life of Man. The Empiricks, says he, contend, that the Search into the Procedure of Nature, and the dark Causes of Things, was needless; since it was not of use to know what might bring on a Disease, but what would take it off. But the learned and more rational Practitioners were firmly persuaded, that it was not possible for any one to know in what manner to set about the Cure of Distempers, who was altogether unacquainted whence they proceed; and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eum verò rectè curaturum, quem prima origo causae non sefellerit.</NOTE> that he alone could do that with Success, who had throughly informed himself of the Causes of them. In the ancient Days, these were thought the Qualifications generally necessary to the Faculty. But methinks a Christian Physician requires something more in his Com∣position; and that he ought not only to be Master of all these Arts and Sciences, but de∣serve also this Commendation wheresoever he appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Accom∣plishments of a good Physician.</NOTE><HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>These ten excellent Endowments being re∣quisite to denominate a <HI>good</HI> Physician, it can't be justly supposed that he can so well attain the same by any other Means, as by a liberal and pious Education; and without going through a regular, careful, and well-directed Course of Studies.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discourage∣ments to study Physick in <HI>Ox∣ford.</HI></NOTE>AND this leads me, in the next place, to take notice of some Discouragements to young Gentlemen to enter upon this Facul∣ty, in <HI>Oxford</HI> especially. In that they are obliged to take the Degrees of Batchelor and Master of Arts, before they can there be ad∣mitted upon the Physick Line; and must then take the Degree of Batchelor of Physick (and that after ten Years Residence) before they can be qualified regularly to hear the publick Professor; which too they must do for full four Years longer, and be also full fourteen Years standing before they can commence Do∣ctors. This tedious Continuance in the Uni∣versity, as well as the Exercises for those four Degrees, can't but be attended with abun∣dance of Charge and Trouble. But whilst they see, in the mean time, their Brethren at <HI>Cambridge</HI> take their Degree of Batchelor of Physick at seven Years standing; and after that, not be obliged to Residence; and at ten Years standing put on their Doctor's Gown: tho' their Time spent in the University is no longer than that required for the Degree of a Batchelor of Physick in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and their
<PB N="15" REF="25"/>Tests of Probation no more expensive nor difficult than his.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Degree of Batchelor of Physick in <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> tanta∣mount to that of Doctor in <HI>Cambridge.</HI></NOTE> The Preference indeed is rather his Due upon these Accounts, when it is considered that he takes three Degrees, performs the Exercises required thereto, and is consequently at a far greater Expence of Money, and the same of Time, as they are at for their Completion, or taking their Doctors Degree: To which if the <HI>Oxford</HI> Gentlemen proceed, as they take more Degrees, so are they in proportion at far greater Charges. And what is far more aggravating, when they see People, that are bred in private Academies, (and thence removed to <HI>Padua, Leyden,</HI> or <HI>U∣trecht,</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> or <HI>Glascow,</HI> where in less than four or five Years Space they shall be <HI>dubb'd</HI> Doctors) intrude themselves into Pla∣ces of Resort and Practice, and by the un∣thinking, major Part of Mankind be cares∣sed, and preferred before our home-bred Phy∣sicians, merely for their Pretences to more Skill acquired by a foreign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regular and home-bred Phy∣sicians postpo∣ned.</NOTE> though a much cheaper and shorter Way of Education: They cannot, I say, help being affected with some Uneasiness and Disgust, to see themselves thus injustly obviated in their Pretences, and post∣poned.</P>
<P>And as theUniversities of other Nations are to be blamed for crowding in upon us such Clusters of mere Novices, (or rather our Laws for suffering them so to do;) so are our own for not better regulating their Methods of Study, and not making the Degrees of Phy∣sick less expensive. It might be more advan∣tageous for the <HI>Oxford</HI> Students in this Art, if for the two first Years they apply'd themselves to the Study of Logick, moral Philosophy, Politicks, <HI>aliisque humanioribus literis,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="16" REF="26"/>and for five more they should not only hear the publick Lectures, but the Professor should direct the Course of their Studies; and by taking them with him into the sick Chambers, should inform them how to apply the Theory in their Practice; and not suffer the young Men to go on in their own injudicious Me∣thods before they commence Batchelors of Physick: Which should be at seven Years standing; and after that time so strict a Re∣sidence should not be insisted on: and at ten Years standing they might assume the Scarlet, having first performed all the Exercises for the several previous Degrees, as by the Sta∣tutes are now required, as well as for that; and being strictly examined, as to their Pro∣ficience and Knowledge in all the several afore∣mentioned necessary Qualifications.</P>
<P>But our publick Professors (whether thro' Negligence or Want of sufficient Salaries to encourage them) seem very indifferent how the publick Exercises are performed; and give themselves no trouble in directing the Students, either in a regular and expeditious Method of Study, or in the usual way of Ap∣plication of Medicines, and the Rules of Practice. Or, if this were too much for our Professors to undertake, a Catalogue of Au∣thors they might readily exhibit; and, out of Conscience, scrutiny and examine more narrowly into the Abilities of those they present to their Degrees in this Faculty: Or, surely there seems great need of some other able Men, who should be appointed to try and judge who are fit to prescribe and administer Physick, before they are rashly admitted to Practice.</P>

But considering that our <HI>English</HI> Saffron is the best in the World, and
<PB N="28" REF="38"/>our Vipers as good as the <HI>Venetian,</HI> and all the Ingredients are to be had here in <HI>London,</HI> as good and cheap as in any Place in <HI>Europe;</HI> why should our Apothecaries be thus suffered to bring an Odium, and make the Integrity of our Nation suspected, and taint and poison us with that Medicine that they call our prin∣cipal Alexipharmic, as well as impose upon us, and the Poor in particular, who use what is called <HI>Venice</HI> Treacle in every Indisposition?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Com∣pound Powder of Crabs Claws.</NOTE>The next Medicine in vogue (with the La∣dies especially, and what enhances the Apo∣thecaries Bills most plausibly) is the <HI>Gascoign</HI>'s Powder; at the Insignificancy, as well as ex∣travagant Price of which, I cannot but won∣der! especially when I see some People, who should be better informed, use it to no Pur∣pose: (For if it is such a wonderful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fine Chalk free from Loam may answer all Ends of this Powder.</NOTE>Absor∣bent, and Alterative in the first Passages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it ought to be thrown in by whole Drams, and that frequently, and not by Scruple-Do∣ses;) and others sell it at one Penny a Grain, or at least 1. <HI>s.</HI> Scruple, because the <HI>Bezoar</HI> is intolerable dear, which they pretend to put into it; I say pretend, because they rarely put one Grain into it; but more frequently make it up with Oyster Shells reduced to a fine Pow∣der, the Juice of some Herb, and a cheap A∣romatick, that may imitate the <HI>Cast</HI> and Fla∣vour of the Bezoar Stone; which is one of those things, which are far-fetch'd and dear∣bought.

And just so it fares too often with modest Physicians, who will prescribe excel∣lent well for a moderate Fee, yet shall be slight∣ly set by therefore; whilst an audacious, and sometimes impertinent Gentleman shall be ca∣ressed by the Apothecary, because he deals much in this, to them profitable, Commodi∣ty, and takes a Guinea, or two Guinea-Fee of the deluded Patient; and because he is a dear Doctor, is esteemed a good one in proportion. As this Powder hath little appparent Virtue in it, so I am satisfied this Oriental Ingredient may very well be omitted without much De∣triment to those that admire it: Whose Foible is discerned and gratified by the crafty Apo∣thecary, in like manner as was that of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> who was angry at his Chamberlain for bringing him a Pair of Hose that cost 3 <HI>s.</HI> and yet was pleased with a Pair that were far worse, that he told him cost a Mark. But if this Powder must still be retained in Use, a <HI>Succedaneum</HI> might be found out to supply the Want of this Stone, (which indeed as it is a Disease to the Creature out of whose Stomach it is taken, I cannot think it any great Cor∣dial to Man.) And these Admirers of dear land foreign Medicines might be more inno∣cently deceived, if we would be at the pains to study the Virtues of some that are better and cheaper, and the Product of our own na∣tive Soils. Our Saffron, Verginian Serpen∣tary Root, the Male Peony Root, the Vale∣rians, Root Aron, <HI>Aristolochiae Rotundae,</HI> our noble White-flower'd Chamomile, Red Field Poppy Flowers, Seeds of Rue, Cardamoms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as Occasion and Symptoms require, may

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Ungar∣bled Drugs.</NOTE>WERE I to proceed to every particular Abuse that is put upon the Physicians, and the People of this Nation, by these self∣interested, covetous Medicine-Makers, I must swell this Dissertation into the full Bulk of the College Dispensatory: But I shall satisfy my self at present with one or two more, which seem to be the fundamental Causes of the In∣crease of bad Medicines, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Neglect to garble</HI> all Drugs, and the Wholesale Apothe∣caries <HI>trucking</HI> with the Druggists; and both of them furnish the Practising, and the Coun∣try Apothecaries.</P>
<P>What Need is there of some proper Per∣sons being authorized by Law to examine eve∣ry Bale and Chest of Drugs, and to destroy all that are found damaged, corrupt, and un∣fit for Use; and that the Censors of the Col∣lege of Physicians should examine the Drug∣gists Shops, as well as those of the Apothe∣caries and Chymists: and that the regularly educated and approved Physicians throughout the Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Country Phy∣sicians should have Power to inspect Apothe∣caries Shops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> should have the same Powers inspect the Shops and Warehouses of Coun∣try Apothecaries, and Medicine-Sellers of all Denominations, and to destroy whatever they find unfit for Use; and to fine also such as,
<PB N="31" REF="41"/>upon-legal proof, are found guilty of there and such like horrid Cheats, Adulterations and unmerciful Exactions. When we see the wholesale Apothecaries buy ungarbled and damaged Drugs of the Druggists, and con∣tract with them to pay for the same, half in Money, and the other half in as bad Medi∣cines:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The impo∣sitions of the Druggists, with the whole∣sale Apothe∣caries. And both furnish Country Apo∣thecaries. <HI>§ 15.</HI></NOTE> (which it is demonstrable they can vent again no way, but to little dabling Medi∣casters, and to Country <HI>Chaps,</HI>) And when those great Apothecaries, who have contracted to serve our Armies and Fleets with Medi∣cines, have had them returned back upon their hands, as altogether useless and corrupt, to the incredible Damage and Danger of the Lives of the best Sailors and Soldiers in the World! But what care these Men, so they get Money. By these means (tho' very destru∣ctive ones to the People) they both (the Drug∣gists and wholesale Apothecaries; and Chymists likewise may be added,) disembogue their Shops of effaete and corrupt Drugs, and of false and adulterate Medicines, and all at dear rates, considering their bad Qualities. Thus they combine to cheat us of our Health and Wealth, without Controul or Inspection:</P>
<P>I wou'd not be so excessively uncharitable, as to accuse all Apothecaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of these base murdering Practices. For as the Proverb hath it, <HI>It is not every one can pickle well.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">All Apothe∣caries, the pra∣ctising and re∣tale Apotheca∣ries especially, take insuffera∣ble prices for the vilest Medi∣cines.</NOTE>AND this is the principal Cause of the ma∣nifest Disagreement between the honest Physicians and the unjust Apothecaries; and also between Physicians themselves. Of which I shall speak more hereafter; having not yet dismissed the the ungrateful Subject the unmerciful Apotheca∣ries have led me into. Not a Family is without the practisiing and retale Apothecaries Bills by them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See §. 4, 10, 14, 15.</NOTE> And their Exactions may be easily dis∣covered, by comparing the wholesale Apothe∣caries and Druggists Bills or Charges to them with theirs.

<PB N="33" REF="43"/>a Farthing a Grain, and sell it out at 96 — half Farthings a Grain.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> in his Art of Distilling tells us, They will make 20 Gallons of Plague Water, at 2 <HI>l.</HI> 9 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> prime Cost: and they sell it out again wholesale at 8 <HI>l.</HI> that is, at 8 <HI>s.</HI><HI>per</HI> Gallon, nay at 12 <HI>s.</HI><HI>per</HI> Gallon, and retale at 2 <HI>d.</HI> an ounce, or 21 <HI>s.</HI> and 4 <HI>d.</HI><HI>per</HI> Gallon. And this is the honestest, and most reasonable of their Gains in things of this nature. In many Articles (to descend to particulars were endless) their Profit runs incredibly higher. And their Pretence for keeping up the Price of Medicines to this exorbitant pitch, is, Because some are perishable.</P>
<P>But the College Dispensatory of 1721. ut∣terly deprives them of this Plea, ordering <HI>all</HI> Medicines to be so wisely prepared, That <HI>few,</HI> if any, are perishable in any reasonable time: And of those that are any way liable to decay, they keep but small Quantities by them, or make them extempore, as they have present occasion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their whole Trade, as now managed, an intolerable Grievance, <HI>&amp;c,</HI></NOTE>Thus their Art is degenerated into a most abominable Grievance, that ever was suffered to be openly and continually carried on, in any the most abject and corrupted Na∣tion under Heaven. The Grocers, (out of whose Company the <HI>London</HI> Apothecaries were at first drawn, and then incorporated) even those of them that are Retalers, and many o∣ther honest Tradesmen declare themselves satis∣fied, if they can get one Penny in a Shilling: and are too frequently obliged to take up and to be content with much less Profit in Commo∣dities of far greater Value, and more exposed to damage than any the Apothecaries deal in. And why they should be indulged in such in∣sufferable
<PB N="34" REF="44"/>and oppressive Demands, and mon∣strous Profit in things (which if they were good) of very little worth, for those Things that cost them little or nothing, is a Thing utterly beyond my Capacity to account for.</P>
<P>All the Efforts of some honest and compassi∣onate Physicians to stop the Current of these Abuses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apothecaries incorrigible.</NOTE> have, for ought I can find, tended to no other End, than to exasperate the cove∣tous and unjust <HI>Mortar-drubbers</HI> against them.

<P>This male Treatment (no doubt on't at first) animated the Doctors to erect their Dis∣pensatories: That the <HI>Sick-Poor</HI> having their Advice <HI>gratis,</HI> might be also supplied with Re∣medies at a very low rate; and that the Rich too might be secure of pure and effectu∣al Medicines at a moderate Price; and the Lives of their Patients, and their own Re∣putation in some measure insured to boot.</P>

The College Dispensatory, I say, is an Under∣taking worthy of imitation by those Physici∣ans that reside in poor and populous Coun∣tries, and are any way able to beat the Charge, and willing to be at the Trouble of erecting a Dispensatory, or keeping a Closet of choice Medicines in their own Houses. And it wou'd be a great Encouragement to the Faculty, if in or near every Market Town, there were a Physician appointed, at a certain Salary (to be raised by a Parish Rate or Levy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) to attend the Poor that shall be sick: who shou'd be brought and placed in Infirmaries provided in every Parish, (or 2 or 3 Parishes might join their Stocks) for that End and Purpose. This wou'd be no more (I dare adventure to affirm, much less) Charge to the several Parishes, than they are now at, in paying ignorant Pre∣tenders to Physick for their attendance upon them, and their bad Medicines: and in Main∣tenance of the Widows and Children of those unfortunate poor Men, that have fallen into bad Hands, and whose Lives might have been preserved, had an honest and skilful Physician been apply'd to. Moreover, as one remarks, The sooner Diseases are taken notice of (those that are Epidemical especially: and these begin
<PB N="36" REF="46"/>generally and make their first advances amongst the poorest sort of People,) by accurate and expert Physicians, the less Footing they will have, the Cure of them will be the easier, and their Advice will be rendered the more effectu∣al. Which being usurped by these injudicious Pretenders, the Distempers being mistaken, or mal-treated, become Malignant, Contagious and Fatal. And the sooner a poor Man is restored to his Health, he will be the sooner able to provide for his Family; and it will be a more especial advantage to the Parish, if it shall prevent his Death: by which else a nume∣rous Family may be left helpless upon their hands. And it will be a great Advantage to the Neighbourhood when any of them want a Physician, by his being so near to them, and he may afford to attend them for much smaller than the present accustomed and extravagant Fees. And the more Visits he makes to the Sick-Poor, the greater will be his Experience, the more certain his Observations, and the more capable will he be to Advise the Nobility and Gentry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But to return to the Matter in hand.</P>

But how come they to be such competent judges, That the Distemper, the Symptoms, and Constitution of the Patient, for whom these Recipes were originally prescribed, and their new Patients Disorders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the same?

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Physicians disagree and abuse their own Faculty.</NOTE>As the Matter seems to stand at present, a Degree in one of our Universities is only a Disadvantage (as said a Gentleman who had just reason to expostulate with the College) as it makes a Man that hath it the Mark of the College, whom they cou'd not (or per∣haps wou'd not,) take notice of, if he had not his Degrees: as this Case, between the Char∣ter of the College of Physicians in <HI>London,</HI> and the Universities hath been stated and set forth: and also as it renders him obnoxious to the Apothecaries, if he will keep his Inte∣grity, and discountenance their exorbitant Proceedings.</P>
<P>Hence it is that so many of our regular Physicians have refused to come into the Col∣lege.

Instead of this, there are Combinations with private Views, to promote particular Advantages: some are applauded, and others supplanted, according as they reject or come into particular Measures. In short, amongst our Physicians, a disregard of the true End of their Institution, <HI>viz.</HI> The Good and Health of the People, seems but too appa∣rent, as well as great want of Candor one towards another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Physick is a precarious Pro∣fession.</NOTE> To whom I would only add this one Consideration, that, as the Laws have not provided for the Support of the Pro∣fessors of Physick, as they have for those of other Professions, by Donations and lucrative Preferments, and their Emoluments are <HI>preca∣rious;</HI> they are not upon a national Establish∣ment, they are to subsist wholly by their Skill, their Industry, and their Reputation, and good will of the People: It highly behoves them not only to encourage the Improvement of Knowledge, but likewise to be tender and cautious of bringing their Faculty into Con∣tempt: and I must assure them, that it is very
<PB N="46" REF="56"/>apparent, that whilst they pursue every one his private Gain, and as Practice is now car∣ried on, the Poor are utterly neglected, and the Rich intolerably abused:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Poor are neglected, and the Rich abused.</NOTE> and neither find any true Remedy, but from the Charitable and Candid (tho' much discouraged) Treat∣ment at the Dispensatory. And if the Gen∣tlemen that are for and against it, proceed much longer in their intestine Debates and A∣nimosities, it will be an addition to the World's Wonders, if Physick shou'd flourish again in this Nation, under the Pressure of all these enormous Abuses! For if the College can maintain the Power they claim over the Faculty in this manner (and I may say too, if the Privileges thereof are thus invaded in every corner of the Nation) our Universities are rendered useless with regard to the Art of Physick, if they cannot effectually Authorize their graduate Physicians.</P>
<P>Had the great and learned Traveller Dr. <HI>Thomas Linacer</HI> (who upon his return, is said to be the Restorer of Learning in our Na∣tion; and founded two publick Lectures in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and one in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> for the Advan∣tage of the Students in Physick) foreseen these Disorders, he never wou'd have foun∣ded also the College of Physicians in <HI>London, That the Students of that Faculty of both Uni∣versities,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The End, for which the College of Phy∣sicians was founded, obvia∣ted.</NOTE><HI>might meet</HI> the more conveniently <HI>together, to consult the Advantage</HI> (and not the Disgrace and Destruction) <HI>of the Profession.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All this</HI> is but the Consequence of artful Faction, kept up by Avarice and Ambition; and crafty Apothecaries amongst our Physici∣ans, greedily prosecuting, as I just now said, particular Advantages and self-Interest; neg∣lecting the publick Good, and the Reputation
<PB N="47" REF="57"/>of the Faculty: and indeed the Health of Mankind; yielding, upon these scores to the Apothecaries; who at the same Time do not stick to supplant them, and are become their Competitors.

<P>But the Majority of the People (of the common Sort especially) commonly take the worst Side (as I have before observed) and give Countenance to Knaves and Pretenders.
<PB N="51" REF="61"/>and neglect Men of Integrity and Knowledge, without any Reason for it, except that one, which is very plain and natural, <HI>viz.</HI> that they are wiser and better than themselves. For we are apt to have great Inclinations to every thing which resembles us, and an Aversion to what is above us.</P>
<P>I need not here again recite, that the right and judicious Understanding of the Animal Oeconomy, a long and regular Course of Stu∣dy and Application, together with abundance of judicious Instructions, and Expence of Money as well as Time; and after all, Expe∣rience too to apply all the acquired Faculties and Science of Physick aright, is necessary to the Accomplishment of a Physician. That the Indications curative are to be taken from the Aetiology of Diseases, and the Explana∣tion of the Causes of Distempers (so far as it may be said to be demonstrative) from Ana∣tomy. But whatever Reason, Art, and the Laws of our Country can advance to the Dis∣couragement of those Persons, that pretend to rely upon other Foundations, especially up∣on the Indications of what is to be done in Diseases from the Urine only; yet these Piss-Pot Doctors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clarissimus Bellini Divinatores ex sola Urina∣rum inspectione dicit Urinantes inanes.</NOTE> are strangely sought to, and incredibly famous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Piss Pot Do∣ctors.</NOTE> notwithstanding the Folly as well as Uncertainty of their Conclusions, is sufficiently apparent! Bottles of Urine are brought 20 or 30 Miles to one of these Wa∣ter-Casters; and he, without seeing the Pa∣tient, (says with Dr. <HI>Byfield, Praesens vel ab∣sens idem est</HI>) tells the old Women all their

Another will do as much for a Sixpenny Fee; a third will give a large Hodgepodge for 3 <HI>d.</HI> For which they all deserve the Pillory, as in 1382,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quacks for∣merly punished. <HI>§. 4.</HI></NOTE> and 1550, when such counterfeit Phy∣sicians were, if our Chronicles may be de∣pended upon, set on horseback with their Fa∣ces to the Horse-tail, the Tail in their Hands as a Bridle, and a Whetstone on their Breast, and so led through the City of <HI>London,</HI> with ringing of Basons, and <HI>banished.</HI> Hence the Proverb of old, <HI>Not so easy to turn a crooked Body streight, as to turn a Mustard Quern;</HI> nor <HI>one Leap out of a Docket</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">n="*" A Manual, or little Collection of Receipts.</NOTE><HI>maketh a Doctor.</HI> Yet such have all their silly Crowds of Admi∣rers, Abettors, and Followers, who run after one or other of them for three or four Mar∣ket-days successively, if the distressed Patient lives so long; and if he is not recovered in that time, they do (as Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> relates of the People in <HI>Cheshire</HI>) make him a Posset, and tye an Handkerchief on his Head; and if that will not mend him, then God be merciful to him.</P>
<P>Here too, suspended Parsons, idle School∣masters, Barber-Surgeons, Sea-Surgeons dis∣carded, broken <HI>London</HI> Apothecaries, decre∣pit Mountebanks, and any one that is un∣known, and hath no other Means of Mainte∣nance, set up for prodigious Doctors; and every Sect and Party have one peculiarly
<PB N="53" REF="63"/>qualified for themselves. Here comes one re∣commended by profligate Immoralities; ano∣ther by Poverty, and a great Heap of Chil∣dren; a third sets up upon a Stock of little or no Learning, and much Self-conceit; a fourth upon abundance of Ignorance, and want of Business in the greatest Place of Business in the whole World; some upon pretended Cures in the unknown Parts of it; and others again boast their Travels far at home, and pass for unborn Doctors, celebrated Corn-cutters, and Washers of fat Brains.</P>
<P>But to leave this Tribe of Unaccountables in their provoking Practices, till the Hand of Pro∣vidence and Justice brings them to their due De∣serts: since the Mischiefs they do are so flagrant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author is naturally in∣duced, by the Course of his Arguments, to appeal to the Legislative Powers; tho that was not his first Design. See Beginning and End of this Tract.</NOTE> that our Lawgivers cannot but be sensible of them, and will sure ere long revive and rein∣force that excellent Statute of the 5th of <HI>Eliz.</HI> and extend it to our Faculty. The Intent of which was, (as is before intimated) That no Persons should take upon them any Art, My∣stery or Trade, but such wherein they had Skill and Knowledge; according to that Rule, <HI>Quod quisque norit, in hoc se exerceat.</HI> And I am sure it is not usual for skilful and modest Men, to pretend to Understanding in any Art or Science, before they have attained to it by an assiduous and regular Course of Study, and a practical Habit. There are some Dis∣eases in which an old Nurse cannot kill; and in such some of these sort of Doctors, (as they are called) and our daring rural Apothe∣caries, gain amongst the Mobile immortal Praises. There are other Distempers, which the best Physician cannot cure: Cases, that no Physician, was it not the Duty of his Calling, would desire to have any thing to do with;
<PB N="54" REF="64"/><HI>viz.</HI> as where any of these Pretenders have been <HI>dabbling</HI> and tampering before he was called in, and have put the Patient out of all Hopes; or in the Confluent Small-Pox, Pur∣ples, Spotted and Malignant Fevers, Diseases not far behind the Plague. And although he does all that he ought, as a Man of Know∣ledge and Honesty, yet commonly if (thro their former male Practices, or the Ungo∣vernableness of the Patient, or the prevailing Humour of those about him) he does not cure, it shall be imputed to him as Mistake or Ignorance, Rashness, or Want of requisite Cou∣rage, Inadvertency or Neglect: He shall be spoken against because he cant do Miracles, retrieve what others have lost, or stay the Omnipotent Hand of God himself. But he shall certainly be defamed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Country A∣pothecaries dis∣ingenuous. Decry all Phy∣sicians, who will not serve their base Turns; and caress any ig∣norant Forma∣list that will.</NOTE> if in all his Pro∣ceedings he hath not favoured the Apotheca∣ries, hath not augemented their Bills, nor skreened their Rashness and daring Errors. <HI>Well!</HI> say they, <HI>this Man was called in to mend, but</HI> (by this, by that, and tother) <HI>hath mar∣red all: And,</HI> saith Mr. Mortar-scraper, (if he doth cure, notwithstanding he labours under all these Difficulties) <HI>I could have done as much my self;</HI> or, <HI>I never saw in all my Life a Man recovered by such a</HI> simple <HI>Method.</HI> Whereas the <HI>Simpleness,</HI> as well as Knavery, is in the Wretch himself; who whilst he regards his own Advantage only, he does not consider at all, that the most <HI>simple</HI> and unmixed Medi∣cines are the best Specificks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of simple Medicines, Specificks.</NOTE> and will do Won∣ders, when administerd by a judicious Hand; but are frequently rendred useless, if not noxious, by being confounded in an hetero∣geneous Hotchpotch, a Mixture contrived ra∣ther to give him an Opportunity to enhanse
<PB N="55" REF="65"/>his Bill, than for the Benefit of the Patient. (I cant avoid the Impertinence of Repetition frequently upon this provoking Occasion.) Nay, and rather than not force a Trade, he will omit the most pertinent Ingredient in the Physicians Bill, and substitute another ac∣cording to his own Fancy, or Interest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apothecaries make up Bills unfaithfully. <HI>Vid. §. 1.</HI></NOTE> or Ma∣lice; serving him as one did the Oracle, when he asked, whether the Bird that he held in his Hand under his Cloak was alive or not; being resolved beforehand to produce it <HI>dead,</HI> had the God pronounced it <HI>alive.</HI> And the cunning Shaver goes on to recommend such a Doctor as will serve his turn. <HI>O! thats a fine Man: He writes well;</HI> that is, plentifully divides Apozems or Juleps into little Draughts, Electuaries into Boluss, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Writes well for the Apothecary, but ill for the poor Patient, who must pay for all. And it is ten to one, if this fine Writer is not like the Gunner, that is said often to <HI>shoot well,</HI> tho quite beside the Mark.</P>
<P>Hence it comes to pass, that the Tribe of accurate Formalists are caressed by the Apo∣thecaries, because they cant well avoid con∣curring with them in all their vile Practices, and horrid Impositions upon the Patient. They prescribe plentifully, and cant well do otherwise, if they follow the Variety of Forms their Authors direct them to; as if the Mul∣tiplicity rather than the Matter of the Medi∣cine made it effectual: Neither can they com∣plain of the Adulteration or Badness of their Medicines, having no true Knowledge of them. (Indeed it is difficult to discover Me∣dicines when mixed throughly, but by their missing in their usual Effects.) Nor dare they correct their extravagant Bills given in to
<PB N="56" REF="66"/>their Patients; for then they must lose their Credit with them, and shall be <HI>outed</HI> as fast as they were introduced into any Family. For it so falls out generally upon any Indisposition, that the Apothecaries are first applyd to; and if it proceeds so far that they cannot remedy it, but rather render it dangerous, then they are consulted what Physician shall be made use of: and to be sure an <HI>honest one,</HI> who dares de∣cry and discountenance these their Abuses, shall be postponed to these intruding Gentle∣men; or, (I am ashamed to speak it) to ano∣ther regular Physician, that will act so unwor∣thily, as to disparage the Faculty by these base Compliances, (who, and all the other Tribe, are but as mere Stalking-Horses to their Friends the sordid Apothecaries, galloping from one Extremity of a County to another to skreen their abusive Practices; and that in extreme Cases only!) Or if they cant sup∣plant him, (the conscientious Physician) by Lies and crafty Insinuations, (as hath been more than once remarked) they will effect it, let him watch them as narrowly as he can, by making up his Prescriptions false; by some <HI>Succedaneum,</HI> or corrupt Drug or other, ren∣dering them ineffectual.</P>

And it is not to be imagined what an Impression their Artifices have upon many unthingking People: not to mention the Arguments of their Friends and Relations in their Behalf stoutly persisted in, stipulating for their Credit.

<PB N="59" REF="69"/>(as is before observed;) or, to supplant him by introducing any forward Formalist, that knows no better, (or, if he does, will act no better) than to comply with their unjustifiable Practices.</P>
<P>In some of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and in some Counties even near to <HI>London,</HI> I know Physicians that keep Dispensatories in their own Houses, very advantageously both to themselves, and to the Vicinity. But in other Parts, a few discerning Persons may commend a Physician, who thus lays himself out for the publick Advantage, but encourage his Enterprize little farther: they are not easily led out of their old Track: they will say he is honest, and at the same time censure his Politicks, and question his Understanding. The Rich, that give him his <HI>Praemium,</HI> will grudgingly pay him little more than prime Cost for his Medicines; and the middle Sort of People esteem him no otherwise than as an Apothecary, thinking he hath Gain enough from his Medicines (tho sold for no more than they cost) without giving him any Fee; and Handy-craftsmen cannot afford to give Fees, (such as are now become customary) tis well if they can pay for a Medicine; and the Poor expect both Advice and Medicines <HI>Gratis;</HI> and too many Parish-Officers neglect them to Barbarity, and rather let some perish than pay much for their Cure. Again:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Igno∣rance and Cre¦dulity of Coun¦try People.</NOTE> Very few Country People will be persuaded to go thro a requisite Course of Physick: they run to the Doctor when they think they shall be dead; the Disease abating, they wait for Nature to relieve them, till Nature is spent; and if an honest Physician would interpose and visit them as frequently as the Necessity of their
<PB N="60" REF="70"/>Case requires, they are apt to think him im∣pertinent; or, if paid accordingly for At∣tendance, a dear, extorting Man; and igno∣rant too, if after all he chance not to be suc∣cessful; and the Apothecary and Piss-pot Doctor to be preferred before him, tho the Mismanagement lies wholly at their own door. And the whole Clan of Pretenders to Physick, and the Apothecaries especially, will traduce him, and acquaint all their Customers with this Instance of his Ignorance; or, <HI>he killed such a one, as sure as Gods in</HI> Glocester: and will never leave off to vilify and oppose him, till they have ruind his Character, if it lies in their Power, with the Vulgar especially, who are the major Part of the People.</P>
<P>And as the Gentry commonly employ one or other of these Sort of Men, when they hear them so unanimously speak against him, they too are very apt to suspect his Judgment, and to be <HI>shy</HI> of coming under his Hands: for no other Reason, but because <HI>Tom</HI> (such a one) hath been their Apothecary for many Years, and can surely judge a little of a Phy∣sician, and he dont affect him; or, because their Friend Esquire (such a one) did not ap∣prove his Methods; or, because he is of <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> damnd Party; and that Blemish ge∣nerally affects a Man. For People of diffe∣rent Parties judge and condemn one another rather by their own Tenets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Preva∣lence of Party Interest.</NOTE> than by the Truth. And when they have, by any of these trite Methods, lessened his Credit, they presently assume a Superiority over him in all Cases, and set up for Censors of the Perfor∣mances of the best Physicians that may appear amongst them.</P>

Though, after all, I need not mince the matter. It is not unbecoming, but praise-worthy, to repre∣hend Persons that will not amend what they are conscious is a Crime, tho' they are unwil∣ling to acknowledge it, or to hear of it.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Remedy against these Epidemical E∣vils proposed. <HI>Vid. §. 9.</HI></NOTE>AND no Remedy against all these reci∣ted Evils seems so feazible and promi∣sing, as the giving due Encouragement to our Physicians that are bred up in our own Aca∣demies, and the making a Law to punish, and effectually to restrain and suppress all unquali∣fied Intruders into the Faculty. <HI>Plato</HI> banish∣ed the famous <HI>Homer</HI> from his imaginary Com∣monwealth. And if this divine Philosopher would not suffer the most celebrated and ex∣cellent Poets, because they might corrupt the Morals of the People with their lewd Fictions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> certainly those that poison and destroy them, whilst they pretend to heal and pre∣serve them, deserve to be banished also. But an honest Physician placed in every Market-Town, or in a Division or Hundred of a County, and a Dispensatory (where Medi∣cines may be had at little more than prime Cost) kept in his own House, and Infirmaries
<PB N="65" REF="75"/>erected, must needs be hugely serviceable to all Sorts of People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Physicians Fees should be regulated, and the Princes of (Bills for) Me∣dicines taxed.</NOTE>But then his Fees should be moderated, and reduced from that extravagant Pitch to which some now advance them: and also be <HI>ascer∣tained;</HI> with Allowances for riding long Jour∣neys, and Night-Work. And the Reasonable∣ness of this Proposal is evident; as also for that of restraining the Apothecaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from going out of their Shops, and practising; since all Means of making them just and faith∣ful, and of moderating the Prices of their bad Medicines, have hitherto proved ineffe∣ctual. What Success can be expected, if a pertinent Bill or Prescript of an honest Phy∣sician is not truly made up? And how this can be done (by many Country Apothecaries especially) the Premises considered rightly, I leave any judicious and impartial Person to de∣termine.</P>
<P>To the popular Objection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections answered:</NOTE> and other Persons that now practise Physick, and sell Medicines, were to be suppressed, and the Price of their Commodities lowered to the Degrees of Profit arising from other Goods, they must either starve, or take upon them some other ways of Maintenance; and thus an useful Order and Community of Men must sink, and be lost to the Commonwealth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is answer'd, It is but just and reasonable they should thus suffer, rather than go on in their mischievous Ways of enriching them∣selves, at the Expence and Destruction of the Estates and Lives of the rest. <HI>Tully</HI> tells us, <HI>Illud quidem natura non patitur, ut aliorum spo∣liis nostras facultates, copias, opes augeamus.</HI> And to the same purpose speak the Rules of

Nemo ex suo delicto meliorem suam conditionem facere porest.</NOTE> Civil Law. It is as unnatural and un∣lawful to support, and enrich our selves by the Spoils and open Oppression of our Neigh∣bours, as by our own private Crimes and se∣cret Villanies. And in all well regulated Go∣vernments, incorrigible Delinquents, and all combined Societies that are found dangerous and detrimental to the Good and Safety of the Whole, have been always cut off and suppres∣sed: According to that of the Poet,</P>

<P>Neither can their Reduction to their wont∣ed Stations, amongst the Grocers and Chand∣lers, be such a mighty Detriment and Dis∣grace to them, as they would fain insinuate; since such great Numbers of them, in the Country Towns especially, vend greater Quan∣tities of Goods in the Grocery, Chandlers, and Distillers, (or rather in the way of <HI>Gin-Shops,</HI> as is the modern Term for the Places where they sell <HI>Drams</HI> of base Spirits) than they do in the way of Pharmacy; and so they become in some measure serviceable, and pro∣mote the Trade of the Nation. Tho' when they go out of their way, and move in a Sphere above their Capacity, they are so far from do∣ing good, that they do incredible Damage; they not only defraud, but kill Men.</P>
<P>I think there is no Man of right Under∣standing but must hold this Maxim, <HI>Salus Po∣puli
<PB N="67" REF="77"/>suprema Lex;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Good, the Health, and Safety of the People, the su∣preme Law; and the End of entring into Corporations, or Societies.</NOTE> That the supreme Law of all is the Safety of the People; and that all Government was ordained by the Institution of God, for the Good and Security, the Health and Happiness of Mankind; and that Men have voluntarily resolved themselves in∣to Societies, for the mutual Preservation and Assistance of one another: Self-Preservation being the primary Aim of every Individual; and since that can't be effected without mu∣tual Assistance, it is natural for a Man to promise to others those Aids and Helps, that he would expect from them on the like oc∣casions. Hence arise all the Obligations a Man lays himself under, when he enters into a Civil Society. Upon this Foot, all Corpo∣rations and Societies of Tradesmen, and in∣deed for the Encouragement of Liberal Sci∣ences, are founded; and every Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Those that obviate and subvert these Ends, ought to be extirpated.</NOTE> or So∣ciety of Men, that apparently subverts the very Ends of those Compacts, ought not on∣ly to be debarred the common Privileges of, but also to be expelled the said Society, of which he is become such an unworthy Mem∣ber; so as instead of using his utmost En∣deavours for the Preservation of the Life and Health of his Fellow-Citizens, he becomes instrumental in their Destruction. As no Man can give another Power to kill him; because the Consent is unnatural, and in itself null and void: So no Community or People can give any Persons Power to destroy them, ei∣ther directly, or by consequence; Because their becoming a Community (or a Nation governed by Laws) was for their Preserva∣tion; and it is preposterous that the Means should be destructive of the End. But how little different from this is our present Case;
<PB N="68" REF="78"/>when the very Order of Men, who are insti∣tuted to be Conservators of our Health, (con∣sequentially at least,) and the Means they pretend to use in order thereto, are so egre∣giously corrupted, as too frequently to be∣come our Destroyers! A Man may give me power to give him Physick, but not Poi∣son.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The abused Art of the A∣pothecary not so necessary, as is the Science of the Physician.</NOTE>And if the Faculty of Physick is by so many illiterate, bold, and dishonest Intruders into that (otherwise) sacred Art, so far cor∣rupted, that there is a Necessity of examining into the Abuses thereof, and to rectify the same, in order to the Preservation of the Health and Lives of the People; and conse∣quently that the Branches of it, that are found not only useless but pernicious, should be dis∣membred; I need not ask; every one must readily agree, that it is safest, and most for the Advantage of the Nation, for an illite∣rate inferior,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nation has not need of, and we can do without Apo∣thecaries; but we cannot do without Physi∣cians.</NOTE> base and abusive <HI>Set</HI> of Me∣chanicks to be laid aside, or made to turn their Hands to other Occupations, to which they are better adapted; than for a learned, noble, necessary Liberal Science to be neglect∣ed, discouraged and rendred useless, in this trading, potent and flourishing Kingdom, and (as we affect to be accounted) this wise and learned Nation. In short, after all that hath been said, I need not go about to prove, (it is self-evident) that the abused Art of the A∣pothecaries is not necessary; that we can do much better without them, and they much better (not so much Mischief) by laying a∣side <HI>that,</HI> and pursuing some other ways of Livelihood: but that the Science of the Phy∣sicians is absolutely necessary; we cannot do

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our World is turned upside down; Truth faileth; there is no Judgment; <HI>Isa. lix. 15. &amp;c.</HI></NOTE>But the Case stands now quite otherways: We see the reverse of all this amongst us. Perverse Custom prevails, and turns all things <HI>topsy-turvy.</HI> Truth faileth; and he that de∣parteth from Evil, maketh himself a Prey; as said the Prophet: There was no Judg∣ment. We don't judge of Men and Things according to the Measures that Nature and right Reason dictate to us; but suffer our∣selves to be imposed upon in every thing; and our Passions and Interest prevail in all our Deportment. We don't esteem ourselves for those Accomplishments, which superior Beings think valuable: Virtue, Integrity, and Knowledge are of small account. As few Men square their Actions by these Rules, so they don't use to cast them into their Bal∣lance; but every one is apt to measure his Understanding by the Extent of his Acres, and his Goodness by the Length of his Purse, or the Party he espouseth; To think no Man happy, that is not rich; and he that is, (let him acquire his Wealth how he will) the only Man to be regarded; and that none are wise, who do not think, and say, and do <HI>at this rate.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformers are generally the Subject of Hatred, Refle∣ction and Ridi∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le; and per∣secuted.</NOTE>And if a Man emerges, once in an Age, who has the Conscience and Courage to de∣tect and decry these fatal, tho' fashionable Errors, and the Guilty begin (with <HI>Deme∣trius</HI>) to fear that their wicked Craft shall be brought to nought, 'tis natural for them to hate him, and persecute him to the utmost of their Power, and to prepossess Mens Minds with groundless Suggestions against him, and to secure their Affections to themselves; that
<PB N="70" REF="80"/>they may be sure to begin to hate him, be∣fore they know him and his worthy Propo∣sals, for fear that by knowing them, they should be constrained to fall in with them, or at least they should not be able to find how to condemn him.</P>
<P>But let me not digress. 'Tis to be fear∣ed, Arguments will prevail but little on this occasion. Nothing but the Legislative Au∣thority can redress this great and prevailing Evil: And it repenteth me, that I had not addressed some worthy Member of it, who might have introduced these affecting Com∣plaints into the August Assembly in which that is lodged, in such sort as might have entituled them to a favourable Audience. But as I had laid no Scheme, had nothing in view but to lay open the Truth and Mat∣ters of Fact, which I thought would sup∣port themselves; so consequently I did not know, or at least did not at the beginning of my Discourse rightly consider, whither it might tend, nor what Consequences and Conclusions might be inferr'd from it. But not to trouble my Reader with apologetic Impertinence:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Legisla∣tive Authority addressed, for Relief against these great E∣vils, as the last Refuge &amp; Re∣sort: tho' that was not at first the Intent of the Author. <HI>Vid. §. 1, 4, 14, 16.</HI></NOTE> If the Author of these Sheets, and his Methods to remedy these dange∣rous Mischiefs, are thought frivolous and insufficient, it is high Time for the Wisdom of the Nation to concert better. And it is to be hoped, that the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will e're long do our Universities justice; since there is no Nation besides, (as a worthy Gentleman hath remarked,) where the Professors of its Universities have not the Liberty of exercising their Profession in any Part thereof, without such Interruption and unheard-of Violence offered to their Per∣sons
<PB N="71" REF="81"/>and Characters. And surely Stupidity and Ignorance, and a Disregard to all Litera∣ture and religious Education, is not so predo∣minant, nor the Concern for the Health and Safety of the People so cold and indifferent, that the Representative Body of our own Na∣tion will think our Peoples Lives of less Value than those of other Regions, or our own Universities the least considerable in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></P>
<P>And when the People are undeceived by this interposing Authority, it is to be hoped these Disorders will be at an end: These irre∣gular Intruders, and unqualified Invaders of this noble, learned and necessary Science will be suppressed, and all due Encouragement af∣forded to our regular Physicians, who justly (and that for the Good and Advantage of the Nation in general, as well as for their own just Dues and private Emolument and Subsi∣stence) claim a Redress of these Grievances: Since all Orders of Men expect to have ju∣stice done their Characters, Rights and In∣terests, from the End and Design of their Institution, and from a general Account of their Conduct; and not from the ill Manage∣ment of a few, or the Introduction of some irregular Customs, which they could not fore∣see, and cannot yet prevent.</P>
