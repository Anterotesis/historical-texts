<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following collection of Cases is the practical part of a considerable work written on glandular affections in general; in which their causes will be explained, and a new theory drawn from the latest anatomical discoveries in the lymphatic system. As numbers are daily suffering under these ra∣vaging complaints; humanity dictated to me the necessity of the present publication, and it is hoped this attempt to alleviate human misery, will be received with candor.</P>
<P>THE names of the generality of patients have not been introduced; but several of dis∣tinction may be referred to, should it be es∣teemed necessary.</P>
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
<P>IT would be highly unbecoming the dig∣nity of the profession, not to have a tender con∣cern for the reputation of others: the candid, therefore, will perfectly conceive my motive for concealing the practitioners, who, un∣successfully, attended the subsequent cases, previous to my being consulted.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE uncertainty of curing ulcerated legs by rest, salivation, &amp;c. and the frequent re∣lapses of patients discharged from hospitals, induced me, near twenty years ago, to search for remedies more adequate to the nature of the com∣plaint. The cause of ulcers I conceived to be owing to some scorbutic or other taint in the habit; in which the lymphatic system was principally af∣fected; an internal alterative treatment was a∣dopted, success in many instances was the conse∣quence, and the improvements were made public in the year 1767<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Treatise on the method of curing ulcerated legs without rest, proved by a variety of Cases.</NOTE> The doctrines<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Sharp's Surgery.</NOTE> that <Q>old ulcers were difficult of cure; that it would be dangerous to attempt the healing them, as it might endanger the patient's life, or produce a diarrhoea, fever, or asthma,</Q> were refuted by undeniable facts.</P>
<P>The seat of the ulcer is commonly in the adipose membrane, which is sometimes thickened and very frequently callous. I discovered in the cure, that these hardened parts became soft and pliant; and from hence some hopes were entertained that a si∣milar practice might remove glandular complaints. A trial proved the conjecture not ill founded; for a considerable number of indurated breasts, which an extensive employment in midwifery fur∣nished, were in general cured by gentle alteratives. Numbers of patients in disorders of this nature pre∣sented themselves, as advice and remedies were given for many years without any gratuity. Afterwards an hospital was opened, to which the poor might daily
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>apply, with no other recommendations than distress and sickness. There were seldom less than four or five hundred patients under cure in diseases of the eyes, schrophulous, cancerous, ulcerous and other indispositions The experience obtained from this great variety of cases, enabled me to comprehend a more beneficial treatment than the common, which was acknowledged defective, by that excel∣lent surgeon, the late Mr. Samuel Sharp. Im∣provements were gradually made from a more mi∣nute knowledge of the complaints, and some dread∣ful affections formerly thought incurable, were conquered by the gentlest means. The disorders in∣cident to the breasts, after delivery, could in ge∣neral be prevented chiefly by a partial abstinence from liquids; or, if tumors or inflammation hap∣pened, remedies more efficacious than shaking the breasts, embrocations of oil, brandy, and vinegar, plaisters of diachilon, or treacle on brown paper, &amp;c. could be administered with a certainty of advantage in every case. A treatise has been written on these subjects, and the curative intenti∣ons fully explained.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A treatise on the diseases of the breasts, and methods of managing women during childbed, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> The confidence of several persons of rank, the public protection, and the pleasure which reiterated success produced, ex∣cited fresh ardor in the pursuit of new enquiries.</P>
<P>The usual methods of managing distempers of the eyes seemed to be exceedingly defective, and in many instances cruel. These subjects next en∣gaged my attention; the ancient and modern treatment was examined, and in a publication censured, or praised, in proportion as it experi∣mentally appeared to have had merits or de∣fects<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A Treatise on the ancient and modern methods of curing diseases of the Eyes, with new improvements.</NOTE>. External applications to the eyes, par∣ticularly
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>poultices, were in general condemned, with the reasons assigned; the inflammatory in∣dispositions were reduced under four heads;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Ives makes a number of useless distinctions.</NOTE> new methods of cure were recommended, and il∣lustrated by proofs of persons relieved. The manner of extracting the cataract was successfully improved, and many patients were restored to sight.</P>
<P>To demonstrate that it is on facts alone that these assertions are made, the following collection of cases now make their appearance as an addition to the former<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Upwards of sixty cases have already been published in the treatises.</NOTE>; in order to extend and confirm the utility of the improvements, and render them more beneficially useful to society.</P>
<P>The principal remedies used in the cures were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Cinnabar antimonii.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cinnabar factitium.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Aethiops mineralis.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sulphur antominii precipitatum.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Aquila alba.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Nitrum purissimum.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Aethiops antimonialis.</ITEM>

<ITEM>Spt. Salis ammoniac.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Aether nitri.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Caput mortuum, of spirits of nitre.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Calx antimonii.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Unguentum saturninum.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>The Aethiops mineralis should be prepared by rubbing a considerable time without any heat.</P>
<P>The aquila alba is the calomel ten or twelve times sublimed, by which its purgative and drastic qualities are destroyed; a quarter, or half a grain joined with an equal quantity of sulphur antimonii precipitatum, when well rubbed for a long time together, and formed into a pill, with confectio damocrat. is called Pilula rubra.</P>
<P>The nitre should be rendered perfectly pure, by fusing in a crucible, and rechristallisation. When mixed with equal parts of aethiops min. and a small portion of cinnabar antimon. by a long tritura∣tion; the composition is called Pulvis mineralis.</P>
<P>Camphorated julap has been often prescribed, with the other remedies, as a resolvent and cor∣rector.</P>
<P>The aquila alba, is given in the dose of a quar∣ter or half a grain, formed into a pill, with sugar, and a mucilage of gum arabic; this is named pilula alba.</P>
<P>The calx antimonii, and the aethiops antimo∣nialis, are given in general to persons who have a dry skin.</P>
<P>The spiritus salis ammoniaci is sometimes added to the solutions of simple nitre, and is called mistu∣ra nitrosa volatilis. The aether nitri is given to patients exceedingly nervous, or who have hectical symptoms; it acts by allaying irritation, without producing the ill qualities of opiates, and is pre∣pared from one part of pure strong spirit of nitre, and two of alcohol, without heat, in a long necked cucurbit, with a head, tubes and receivers proper for conveying the white fumes; and is called Es∣sentia volatilis,</P>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<P>The caput mortuum of spirits of nitre, is what remains after the distillation, according to the me∣thod of Glauber, and is called Sal neutralis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The difference is very considerable between this salt and that prepared in the common manner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The success in the cures will greatly depend on the purity of the remedies. An unadulterated nitre is rarely to be obtained; as what is sold, com∣monly contains a portion of sea salt, and is united sometimes with a worse ingredient.</P>
<P>Crude antimony is often impure. The argentum vivum, even when it passes through leather, is fre∣quently adulterated with poisonous ingredients; therefore that used in the following cases, has al∣ways been revived from cinnabar. The aqulla alba at present is not commonly prepared; the calomel, however, which it is hoped will not be substituted for it, will not answer the purposes intended.</P>
<P>The sal neutralis is seldom to be had genuine. The medicine in the shops nearest to it is the sal po∣polychrestum. The goodness of the calx antimonii, and the aethiops antimonialis, will greatly depend on the purity of the articles which compose them. The factitious and the antimonial cinnabar is fre∣quently adulterated with red lead, and if taken in∣wardly, or received as a fumigation, must do in∣finite mischief.</P>
<P>Every one accustomed to the study and practice of chemistry, will see the necessity of insisting on exactness to be observed in the preparations<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A number of experiments on these preparations, with the manner of detection if they should be sophisticated, may be the subject of a future essay.</NOTE>, which when properly administered, produce little, or no sensible operation. At first small doses should be prescribed, which may be gradually increased, as the constitution becomes more habituated to them.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. A—, at Lady T—, aged between 40 and 50, had been afflicted with a hard∣ness of the breast, which drew in the nipple; the pains had been exquisite on change of weather for between four or five years; at no time was the breast easy, and the motion of the arm was impaired. Ap∣plication had been made to several practitioners; some of the first eminence were consulted; but not the least advantage obtained, and the patient be∣came exceedingly reduced, from the tortures and an∣xiety of mind; not having the least prospect of being cured, or even relieved. She was recommended to me by an Apothecary near Grosvenor Square, and took the pilula rubra, and the pulvis mineralis. In about six months the cure was perfectly accomplish∣ed. It is now three years since; the patient enjoys a good state of health, and has had no return of the disorder. This cure is known to several persons of rank.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>MRS., formerly servant to — M, Esq. aged 40, had three large stony hardnesses in the left breast, which had been very painful between four and five years, so as often to prevent her rest; she had repeatedly consulted a skilful court surgeon, had taken several remedies without relief. She was ordered the pilula rubra, and the solutio ni∣tri three times a day. In nine months, during which time the pains decreased and the swel∣lings gradually resolved, she was cured and re∣mains well.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. M., well known to several families of fashion, aged betweeen 40 and 50, had been for above two years laboring under great pains in the breast, the veins of which were tumid and tortuous, and there were several hardened swellings detached from each other. The patient was of a remarkable delicate constitution, exceedingly nervous and irrita∣ble, and had undergone repeated bleedings, by the advice of an eminent city surgeon, without any be∣nefit. She took the pilula rubra three times a day, and a solution of nitre, and in about six weeks all the swellings were resolved, and the veins of the breasts reduced to their natural size. This patient, con∣trary to my advice, neglected taking her remedies, and was attacked with a disorder in the womb, and afterwards the breast became painful, the veins swelled again; but on returning to the medicines, a cure hath been obtained.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE IV.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. C, aged 44, Old Street, had a schirrus or hard swelling of the whole breast
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>for six years, and for above two years before she applied, had been in constant and violent pains. There were four foul livid ulcers, which discharged a very offensive acrimonious humour; the veins of the breast were enlarged, and she was in such tortures, as to be deprived of rest night and day. An eminent hospital surgeon had advised her to have her breast cut off; and declared it to be impossible to cure her. She took the pilula rubra ter de die, and so∣lutio nitri. The hardened parts gradually resolved; the breast which was before fixed became movea∣ble, the ulcers healed, and the cure was accom∣plished in between two and three months. This person has remained ever since in good health, and has not had the least symptom of a complaint in the breast, though it is between six and seven years.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<P>A Very respectable Baronet recommended Mrs. E—, of Hertfordshire, for advice in a large hard swelling in the whole breast, which was greatly distended, immoveable, and as hard as a stone; besides this, there were five large ul∣cers discharging an exceedingly offensive matter, excrescences were likewise forming and sloughing away continually. This disorder had been bad nine months. The pains were acute, and the matter discharged was so corrosive, as to erode the adjacent parts. Neither ease nor rest could be ob∣tained even by the use of opiates. The arm on the diseased side was with difficulty moved, espe∣cially in elevating it towards the head. The pi∣lula rubra, and the pulvis mineralis, were given, to which was added sal neutralis; the external parts were anointed with oleum camphoratum, and the cure was effected in a few months;
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>above a year and a half has elapsed since, with∣out any return of the complaint.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. D—, aged 64, formerly belonging to the houshold of her late Royal Highness the Prin∣cess Dowager of Wales, had a swelling and hard∣ness in her right breast for twelve years, from a blow, which not increasing was not much attended too. About two years ago an ulcer was formed, surrounding the nipple; which discharged a great quantity of acrimonious serum; the hardness much increased in size, was very painful, and it was with difficulty her right arm could be lifted to∣wards the head. By bleeding occasionally, the use of the pulvis mineralis and pilula rubra, the swelling has been considerably reduced, the use of the arm recovered; the ulcer has not become lar∣ger; and though the perfect cure of this case can∣not be expected; yet life may be rendered tolera∣bly comfortable for a number of years, in a disor∣der that rough methods might have put a period to.</P>
<P>I sincerely believe, that if these remedies of the al∣terative kind were always used on the first ap∣pearance of any hardness, or swelling in the breasts or womb, that either their increase would be pre∣vented, or a perfect cure would commonly be effected. Complaints in the breast are evident; but those of the womb are often misunderstood by physicians, and treated very improperly, owing to a want of practical skill in midwifery. The bark and acids frequently do irreparable mischief, if given in the schirrus or ulcer, as likewise the use of hemlock, opiates, salt water, baths, injec∣tions, &amp;c. &amp;c. Many melancholy instances of this nature have happened, which, were they publish∣ed, would strike minds, susceptible of feeling, with horror.</P>

<HEAD>CASE VII.</HEAD>
<P>A LADY, near 40 years of age, had for a consi∣derable time a large hardened swelling in the right breast, supposed originally to have arisen from an accidental blow; it had not been much noticed for some years, as it had not occasioned pain. About the time the menses were partially suppressed, a pain was felt, the swelling gradually increased, and soon occupied and hardened the whole breast: the nipple was drawn in, and an ulcer formed, with a large excrescence like a mulberry near it. This case was cured by the pilul. rub. and pulv. mineralis in less than four months. The breast became soft, the excrescence dropped off, and the ulcer healed; the external application used was the ung. saturninum to the sore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Half a pound of a well prepared white lead, boiled gently for an hour in one pound and a half of hog's lard.</NOTE>, and the oleum camphoratum, where the skin was not broken. This lady has remained perfectly well since the cure, which is now above five years, and has been advised to take the remedies one month, or six weeks in spring and autumn by way of prevention, because there has been an hereditary cancerous and schrophulous complaint in the family.</P>

<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. B—, in Oxford-road, had suffered un∣der a painful hardness of the left breast for above five years, which extended towards the axilla, and greatly incommoded the use of her arm. The pilula rubra and the solutio nitrosa were taken internally four times in the day, and the oleum camphoratum was used externally. This case was cured in be∣tween three and four months.</P>

<HEAD>CASE IX.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. F—, Milbank Westminster, had her whole breast exceedingly swelled, and indura∣ted adhering so firmly to the pectoral muscle, as to be immoveable; there were likewise some glan∣dular swellings in the armpit. The patient was of a delicate constitution, very nervous, and her apprehensions had been so greatly alarmed, from the misery she had undergone, and the fruitless en∣deavors that had been used to relieve her, that her anxiety of mind joined with the disorder, had brought on a universal relaxation of the habit. She looked pale and hectical, was afflicted with a cough and shortness of breath, fever, and night sweats. She took the pilula rubra ter de die, and the pulvis mineralis, mixed in water, immediately after each pill. A light diet was recommended, and an abstinence from all acids; which last circum∣stance should be observed always when alteratives are given In one month the constitution was considerably amended; though little impression had been made on the tumor, except that it was not so painful. By a perseverance in the remedies, and gradually increasing the doses, in two months after the breast was perfectly cured. The me∣dicines were directed to be continued for six weeks more, good health was restored, and no return of any of the symptoms have since appeared. Six years have elapsed since this cure.</P>

<HEAD>CASE X.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. D—, High Holborn, had a violent in∣flammation and hardened tumor of the breast; her child in sucking had torn off the nipple; the pains were exquisite, the hardnesses were numer∣ous, small and detached from each other. This case was not of the cancerous kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A distinction should be made between indurations, aris∣ing in child-bed, and those of the cancerous kind; these last seldom make their appearance before the age of 36, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scarce happen to breeding women.</NOTE>, but equally distressing to the patient, who had no rest. The pilula rubra was given, and the solutio ni∣trosa. In one month the cure was accomplished; the patient suckled her infant during the cure with the other breast; the diseased part became as soft as ever, and a flow of good milk continued till she weaned her child.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XI.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. H—, near Charlotte Street, Blooms∣bury, 1770, had a large induration of the left breast, extending to the axilla, attended with vio∣lent pain and inflammation. Bleeding was ordered; the pilula rubra, the camphorated julap, with so∣lutio nitrosa, were taken; externally, a poultice was applied, with the oleum camphoratum. This case was cured in less than a fortnight, and the infant sucked without any disadvantage during the taking of the medicines.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XII.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. S—, West Street, St. Anns, had been labouring under a diseased breast between two and three months. Abscesses had repeatedly formed
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>and broken; the matter was discharged, but still they were succeeded by other tumors. Several hard swellings were in different parts of the breast, and the exquisite pains had greatly emaciated and re∣laxed the whole habit. The pilula rubra, the solu∣tio nitrosa, with the camphorated julap, cured this case in the course of three weeks.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="13" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE XIII.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. F—, in King Street, St. Anns, had been delivered between two and three months; on receiving cold the left breast swelled, became hard and scarce moveable through excessive distension; the shooting acute pains attending it were intole∣rable. Shaking the parts, fomentations, poultices of lilly root, ointments and diachilon plaisters, had been administered; but the complaint increased, and the patient was truly miserable, not having the least ease night or day. Bleeding was at first prescribed; the pilula rubra, and the solutio ni∣trosa were given in large doses. The inflammation soon subsided, the hardness dispersed, and the breast became perfectly soft in about four weeks.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="14" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE XIV.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. G—, Pater-noster-row, between 30 and 40, had a diseased breast near two years; there were at least eight or nine different swellings, hard, painful, and the surface of the breast was inflamed in several parts. Swellings which had formed mat∣ter, had broken into many fistulous ulcers, dis∣charging an acrimonious serum; some of these had healed and formed fissures. The pains, and the
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>constant misery of the patient, were almost inex∣pressible. Various remedies in the forms of poul∣tices, plaisters, liniments, &amp;c. &amp;c. had been used, without success. Bleeding was ordered, the pilula rubra and solutio nitrosa. In about four∣teen days the patient was considerably relieved; the breast was much relaxed, and the cure was finished in about ten weeks after.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="15" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE XV.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. C —, Woodstock Street, Marybone, had suffered great misery for near two years, from a disease of the right breast. At first there were several hardnesses which broke into ulcers, and being deep seated, were very tedious in coming to suppuration. The swellings in different parts had broken and discharged matter thirteen or fourteen times, occasioning the most exquisite tortures, which greatly reduced the patient; she could not lift her arm to her head. Application had been made to a physician of eminence, and a surgeon, for relief; the common poultices were directed, and laxative physic; but neither ease, nor the prevention of fresh formations of matter suc∣ceeded their use. The pilula rubra, with the calx antimonii, and the solutio nitrosa were prescribed; ease was soon obtained, the hardnesses seemed to be resolving, and in nine weeks this case, which had been so truly distressing, was cured.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="16" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE XVI.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. W. recommended by Lady H—, near Berkley Square, being in the sixth month of her pregnancy, was attacked with a violent inflamma∣tion and sharp pain of the breast; succeeded by a
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>hardness, which resisted pressure; an abscess near the nipple had also been formed, and discharged a great quantity of matter. The hardness, however, still remaining, attended with exquisite pain; not∣withstanding the patient's situation, I prescrib∣ed the pilula rubra quater de die, with the solutio nitrosa, and in about three weeks a perfect cure was effected. She has since had two chil∣dren, and the breast remains well. This case▪ amongst many others, might be adduced as proofs of the safety of these alterative remedies, and the mildness of their operation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="17" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE XVII.</HEAD>
<P>I was recommended by Her Grace the Dutchess of—, to Mrs. P—, who had a cancerous complaint in her breast. She had been for near two years under the care of a surgeon, who as∣serted, with confidence, that she would certainly be cured. He applied caustics to some hardened tumors under the arm, as likewise to the breast; and it was reported, that he had given some pre∣parations of arsenic; this last circumstance, however, can scarce be credited, we should hope it not true. The ulcer where the caustics had been applied was at least an inch and half deep, and four or five inches long, discharging a most offensive matter. She was in exquisite tor∣tures day and night. At first sight of the case, I pronounced it incurable, to the noble friends of the patient; and all that could be attempted, was a mitigation of the symptoms. The ulcerated parts were dressed with the ung. saturninum with camphor. The pulvis mineralis was given in small doses, and considerable ease was pro∣cured. The putridity of the discharge, however,
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>and the other miserable circumstances of the cases brought on hectical symptoms; a difficulty of breathing every day increased, and the patient died, most probably a victim to the pretended knowledge and cruel practices of her surgeon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="18" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. M—, in the year 1767, perceived a drawing in of the nipple, without any hardness of the right breast. An eminent surgeon in town advised an issue; afterwards was prescribed the aethiop. vegetabil. and mercurial pills. The disorder, after this, did not increase till towards the year 1771, hemlock was then ordered by a very learned physician. The breast swelled and was hard; under the arm were likewise tumors. In May 1772 a caustic was applied, under the specious name of a plaister, to draw the cancer out. The caustic was continued weekly, and a poultice used, till the whole schirrus was sphacelated and removed, which happened July the 6th. It was afterwards dressed with Turner's cerate, healed, and continued well for two years, though little indurations, about the size of pease, appeared on the remaining part of the breast. From the latter end of 1774, until the spring of 1775, the pa∣tient had considerable pains. The part where the caustic had been fixed, broke out again; the swel∣ling in the axilla was enlarged, and pressing on the great vessels, occasioned a considerable swelling in the arm. The surgeon, mentioned in the last case, was consulted, who promised confidently a cure, and boldly applied caustics to the tumors in the axilla; this produced a large ulcer, brought on great pain in the parts, accompanied with a cough. Afterwards, by his utmost efforts, the sore could
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>not be healed. On June the 12th I first inspected the diseased parts, and acquainted a relation of the patient's, that little success could be expected, as violent methods had been used. An attempt, however, was made, the pilula rubra and the pul∣vis mineralis, with the calx antimonii, and a pec∣toral mixture, were given with great success; for in about three months the ulcers, both in the axilla and breast, were nearly healed; and the lady went into the country happy beyond expression. In lest than a twelvemonth, however, the ulcers broke out again, and the patient languished for two or three months and died. Perhaps if no remedies whatever had been used, the advice of the first surgeon consulted, attended to, this lady might probably have been living now.</P>

This lady was advised to apply to a gentleman, who endea∣vours to persuade the world, that he can safely ex∣tract cancerous tumors with a plaister. Though in the present case there was no sore, nor any pres∣sing symptoms, the operator rashly applied his caustics, with the most confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt promises of success, and repeated them for four or five months, the patient suffering the whole time the most shock∣ing tortures. The malady increased; which is most commonly the case where violent methods are adopted; a large cancerous ulcer, surrounded with considerable spongy excrescences, appeared, which, from time to time, were destroyed by the caustics, but returned soon again. The disease extended it∣self to the other breast. Hemlock, opiates, pow∣dered corns of a horse, carrot poultices, had been
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>administered without success. Upon my being consulted, an opinion was delivered, that the cure could not, under such circumstances, be expected, and mitigating the symptoms would be doubtful. This judgment was pronounced from experience in a multiplicity of cases, where such barbarous treatment had precluded every hope of relief. The patient, however, wished for some trial to be made; the pilula rubra, and the pul∣vis mineralis, were given, and the inflammation, which had chiefly arisen from the caustic salts, subsided, the progress of the disorder was pre∣vented from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ing its dreadful ravages on the other breast; but no other advantage was obtained, except that the pain was in some measure abated. Sloughs succeeded sloughs, and occasioned a most offensive stench; the acrid discharge was consider∣able; the patient became hectical; opiates could not produce relief, and thus lingering under the most distressing and accumulated miseries, shock∣ing indeed to the spectators, but inexpressibly so to the worthy lady who languished under them; she died about two months after.</P>
<P>From experience it may be asserted, from the circumstances of the foregoing case, the lady might have lived years, and even though she might not have been cured; by bleeding, the alterative reme∣dies occasionally, a proper diet, and mild applica∣tions to the part, the complaint might have occasion∣ed little trouble, and perhaps not increased. Many, too many similar examples have occurred, of life being shortened, and the most inexpressible mi∣series created, by the cruel application of caustics, as well as an unfeeling use of the knife. There are many instances of cancers, in which it would be fruitless to attempt the cure; the physician is
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>then the true friend, who advises the patient to do little or nothing, and submits the case chiefly to nature.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XX.</HEAD>
<P>A MAIDEN lady aged 47, about eight years ago, applied for advice in an induration of the right breast; the nipple was inverted, and dis∣charged an acrimonious serum, attended with con∣siderable pain; there were likewise glandular swel∣lings in the axilla. The hardness was of such a nature, that there were not the least hopes of re∣solving it; the amputation of the breast had been recommended by a surgeon, which, had it been performed, would have been exceedingly cruel, and probably fatal, as no prospects of success could have been entertained, owing to the axillary af∣fection. The pulvis mineralis alone was ordered ter de die; and was continued for six weeks at a time, spring and autumn; a regular diet was ob∣served, wine, acids, and salt meats were abstained from, a quarter of a pint of warm water was ta∣ken every day before meat. The disorder by this means did not increase for three years, about which time the part excoriated, afterwards became ulcer∣ous, and a considerable slough was thrown off. An ulcer has continued ever since, which is not pain∣ful, except at changes of weather in the winter season; the pilula rubra was used for one month, but as no advantage was obtained, it was discon∣tinued. This lady visits her friends, and suffers little or no inconvenience from her cancerous com∣plaint, nor is she even suspected by any of her most intimate acquaintances, to labor under any such indisposition. Many similar cases to this have come under my inspection.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XXI.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. P—, aged 42, had been mother of six children. After the delivery of the two last she had each time a fever from cold, which occasioned a great hardness of the left breast, that continued nearly in one state for nine years. In the year 1771, the breast was painful, and rather increated in size for above three months. This alteration succeeded a violent inflammatory fever. From this time, until Jan. 1773, there were shooting pains: when, the menses ceas∣ing to appear, some eruptions, discharging a sharp watry humor, were discovered; the advice of an eminent physician was taken; salts and manna tinctura senae and hemlock pills were ordered, and persisted in for seven months: but the disease grew considerably worse. In the latter end of July and all August, the salt water was drank; which greatly relaxed the stomach and intestines, and answered no good purpose. On October 3, 1773, she applied to me for relief; the breast was then as large as a child's head two years old, excessive hard, inflamed, uneven in its surface, extending to the axilla, where likewise were some indurations, and the arm on that side was considerably swelled. On the lower part of the breast was a cancerous ulcer, some part of which was soft and fungous; there were many fissures, from which issued a very acrid discharge. The pains were so acute and distres∣sing, that no rest could be obtained; a continual crying was heard, like to a person in labour. Bleeding was first prescribed; the pilula rubra, the pulvis mineralis, and the solution of camphor, with the essentia volatilis, were administered. To the wound was applied the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng. saturninum; to
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>the surrounding, enlarged, and distended parts, the oleum camphoratum. In fourteen days the breast was greatly relaxed, the pains were conside∣rably diminished, and rest at night was attained, before the remedies had been taken four days. The plan was persevered in; about three months after the ulcer was healed; and the indurated parts were perfectly resolved. The remedies how∣ever were continued ten weeks more, when the cure was accomplished.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="22" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE XXII.</HEAD>
<P>A lady of rank, between 70 and 80, had a large hardness of the cancerous kind in the left breast; a great part of the induration was extremely hard, and on the lower part was a very livid ap∣pearance with little fissures. The whole breast was diseased, inflamed and extended, so as to affect the edge of the right breast, and there was a large tumour towards the axilla; the pains had become exceedingly troublesome, the swellings had increased rapidly, and were very alarming. This was a case in which no cure could be expected; an alleviation of the misery alone could be attempted. The opinion I gave to several ladies of quality, friends to the afflicted patient, and the noble Lord her sons was, that a cure was impossible; but that some hopes were entertained, that the inflammation, swellings and pains, in a great measure, could be removed. The pilula rubra was administered, with the pulvis mineralis ter de die. In about three weeks the inflammation entirely subsided, and all the swelling, except that very hardened part, in a great degree resolved, the breast was relaxed, and the pains nearly abated. The pill was then inreased in its dose, and the powder. This
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>course was continued for between two and three months, and the patient was very easy. The livid part at this time, as had been prognosticated, broke and formed an ulcer; this was succeeded by a spha∣celus of the stony induration, which was thrown off gradually, and with proper assistance gently re∣moved. The discharge was now exceedingly of∣fensive, from the putridity of the parts sloughing away; the carrot poultice was applied, but answered no good purpose whatever. In this manner the whole of the diseased part came away, and there was an ulcer, in which me hand might be buried. The remedies were continued, the ulcer became clean and not offensive, and little or no pain was experienced. The discharge from this large ulcer was very considerable, which would have been much larger, had not the medicines fortunately resolved a very considerable part of the tumor: the patient gradually became weaker, and the medicines were then discontinued Oedematous swellings of the legs afterwards made their ap∣pearance, probably owing to the universal relaxa∣tion of the habit, and with very little or no pain the patient languished for same time, and died.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. B—, aged 50, was recommended for relief by a lady of fashion, having several hardened swellings in her left breast. The right breast had been taken off by the knife, about one year and a half before at St. George's Hospital; the wound afterward healed; but the disorder being trans∣ferred to the other sound breast, which is no un∣common thing where the amputation is perform∣ed, caused great pain and inflammation. The pi∣lula rubra was given four times in the day, and
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>the pulvis mineralis, with the sal neutralis. In a∣bout two months the swellings considerably di∣minished, the stony hardnesses, detached from each other, were much softened, and the pains entirely abated. The remedies, during between three or four months in the summer, whilst I went to France and Holland, were persisted in, and on my return I found the whole of the swellings dispersed, and the breast appeared quite sound. This person then went and officiated as cook in a family, which was her former employment, and remained well for above a year; but on receiving a violent cold, the swellings in the breast appeared again without any ulcer; she neglected applying for some time; and from appearances, there was no reason to hope, that the remedies could again succeed. The trial confirmed the opinion; for no impression whatever could be made afterward on the disease. The patient became hectical, suffered very little pain indeed, and in about ten months after died.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>A noble lady recommended a poor woman, aged 43, mother of eleven children; who had suffered considerable time from an ulcer and schirrus of the breast. The pains were exceedingly distressing, and the discharge so acrid, as to corrode the ad∣jacent parts. The saturnine ointment was applied externally, and the pilula rubra, with the pulvis mineralis were taken. In a little more than three months the ulcer was healed, and the schirrus part perfectly softened. The remedies were continued longer to confirm the cure, and there has been no return since, which is near two years.</P>

<P>THE following case has made its appearance be∣fore, though with great reluctance of the author, in a letter addressed to Dr. Hunter, on the dan∣gerous tendency of medical vanity, occasioned by the death of the late lady Holland. The republica∣tion was never intended; but a report having been for some years industriously circulated, that the lady, mentioned in that epistle, died miserably of the disorder, pronounced by me to be perfectly cured: in vindication of the truth, and lest such a story should preclude all hopes of relief to pati∣ents in similar circumstances, it may be necessary to declare, that the lady who is now living in the neighbourhood of Missenden, Bucks, has enjoyed the most perfect health since the cure.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1767, M. S. a lady in the country, perceived some small eruptions in several parts of the skin. Dr. Bates, a physician esteemed in the neighbourhood, prescribed a lotion. Afterwards, by the advice of Mr. Edmonds, a skilful surgeon, at Wendover, a quicksilver girdle was worn a con∣siderable time, and the eruptions disappeared.</P>
<P>In the year 1768, an acrimony in the skin was again very troublesome on using any considerable exercise. Various medicines were administered, but without any benefit; and the lady was advised to go to Brighthelmstone, to use the warm bath, and drink sea water. These methods produced a great relaxation without curing the eruptions, and pro∣bably laid the foundation of these complaints,
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>which afterwards became so dangerous and alarm∣ing: for a pain was soon felt near the neck of the bladder, succeeded by a swelling, which fre∣quently suppressed the urine.</P>
<P>From this time the symptoms became more vi∣olent, the pain in the tumour was so exquisite, that the lady was frequently deprived of rest. Dr. Bates prescribed the common uterine remedies, thinking (as I have been informed by the family) the case to be an ulcer of the bladder, or a schir∣rus of the uterus.</P>
<P>These complaints gradually increased for two or three years, and the lady finding no relief from any remedy which was prescribed by the medical gentlemen of the county in which she resided, it was thought necessary to consult another physi∣cian. Dr. Smith, a gentleman of distinguished reputation, and one of the professors of the universi∣ty of Oxford, was accordingly consulted.</P>
<P>At this time the lady was incapable of using any exercise without pain. The urine was some∣times suppressed; at others, it issued involunta∣rily, commonly occasioning great uneasiness. There was a sanious discharge, which was consi∣derable. Dr. Smith prescribed as follows.</P>

<P>We now find that the hemlock, that fashiona∣ble and destructive drug is administered, but with∣out the least advantage.

<P>These cretaceous preparations, joined with gen∣tle cardiacs, were intended to relieve a diarrhoea, that probably arose from an irritation in the rec∣tum, which was afterwards productive of an ulcer in that intestine.</P>
<P>On the 14th of December a fifth consultation was appointed; the ill success of the prescriptions, joined with some additional symptoms, which were concluded very dangerous, induced the physicians candidly to acknowledge the impossibility of re∣lieving the lady; Dr. Hunter declared to Capt.

<P>The foregoing prescriptions were certainly in∣adequate to the cure of such an obstinate disease: but, as it is the common mode of practice, a de∣viation from it perhaps would have been consider∣ed erroneous, as being contrary to the rules of art. Established maxims, however unsuccessful, are seldom relinquished, though the preservation of life is frequently dependant on it.</P>
<P>The lady had a schirrus of the uterus, which produced an inexpressible and constant pain. There was a continual sanious discharge of that complex∣ion and fetor, which characterise a cancerous ul∣cer; the patient was under the disagreeable neces∣sity of lying in bed, for the evacuation of the urine and feces, and both were attended with great pain, and a considerable quantity of puru∣lent matter, consequently there was an ulcer in the rectum. These symptoms, after the administration of the opiates and cretaceous medicines, were ac∣companied
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>with costiveness, the most excruciating pains, cold shiverings, nausea, and sometimes vo∣mitings, loss of memory, and a countenance, which seemed to foretel a total dissolution. So emaciated and exhausted was the patient, that na∣ture seemed too weak to assist the operation of any medicine. A great part of the surface of the body was covered with scorbutic eruptions; and the least motion, even from the bed to a sopha, occasioned the most painful sensations. At this time Lord le Despenser did me the honour to re∣commend me, in consequence of my success, in a case which his Lordship was acquainted with. At the request of the brother, Captain S. I visited the Lady on the 15th of December, 1772. I exa∣mined minutely every circumstance, and endea∣voured to gain a clear information of what had been already attempted by the gentlemen who had been consulted, and committed the whole immediately to paper, which was just as I have related it.</P>
<P>A consideration of this complicated case, dis∣posed me, however, to believe, there yet remained some hopes of effecting a cure. I resolved, there∣fore, to administer some remedies, which expe∣rience gave me reason to think were more adequate to the cure of such inveterate complaints, than those which had been already prescribed. I began with the pilula rubra and pulvis mineralis, in very small doses, and forbad the use of opiates, as their bad effects in weakening, greatly overbalance the little temporary relief they give.</P>
<P>These remedies produced such excellent effects, that the costiveness was removed, and all the symp∣toms were alleviated in a fortnight. The patient was then removed into the country, and recovered daily. In about one month she could sit up three
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>or four hours, though in the most inclement part of the winter. In about four months more by continu∣ing the remedies, the Lady recovered her memory perfectly, and every discharge had a more favour∣able appearance. The eruptions entirely disap∣peared. She recovered her appetite and natural rest, which for some years before she had been de∣prived of. By a perseverance in the same medicines, and by gradually increasing their doses, a perfect cure was at last accomplished.</P>
<P>The Lady continues in perfect health, and rides on horseback, without the least inconvenience.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In complaints of the breast and womb all rough astrin∣gents are commonly injurious, especially if they be of the schirrus kind. The giving bark, elixir of vitriol, tincture of roses, &amp;c. &amp;c. which is a common practice, frequently does irreparable mischief in those floodings that are the forerunners of cancerous complaints, and happen between the ages of 35 and 50.

<P>MRS. B—, was recommended by a surgeon, who had a large induration, ulcer and distension of the womb. Violent floodings had repeatedly distressed the patient; great pains and bearing down had rendered her truly miserable. Various medicines, amongst the rest injections, had been prescribed by practitioners of eminence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nothing, certainly; can be more irrational than the use of injections in uterine complaints; though the most approved authors and practitioners recommended them. The os uteri, or mouth of the womb, when the uterus is in an unimpreg∣nated state, will scarce admit a hog's bristle; how then is the pipe of a syringe to be introduced? or, supposing the intro∣duction of a pipe possible, what vac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity is there in the uterus capable of receiving an injection? If the parts should be can∣cerous and ulcerated, an aperture is sometimes discoverable, and in that case every hard substance would irritate; therefore could the pipe be conducted through the aperture, which every man-midwife knows to be next to impracticable, such a substance would only injure the parts, and increase the pati∣ent's misery; and if any sharp or corrosive matter is injected, it bids fair to hasten death. Hence may be seen the necessity of examining into the merits and defects of the common modes of practice, and to depart from them, when they are demon∣strably proved to have their origin in ignorance; for every one who has a precise idea of the anatomy of the uterus, must be struck with conviction of the impropriety of administering in∣jections in the schirrus or ulcers of the womb, unless merely for cleansing the vagina.</NOTE>, both as

<P>A lady of fashion, naturally of a delicate con∣stitution, above 40, who formerly had several hard labors, and particularly with her last child in 1761, had been suffering for near fourteen years with a complaint in the rectum. In the early months of pregnancy the piles were continually troublesome, and for fourteen years after the last delivery, on every evacuation of the feces, was a quantity of blood discharged. When the disorder was first dis∣covered, a very eminent surgeon and a man-mid∣wife injudiciously advised turpentine glisters to be injected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certainly no practitioner who understood the anatomical structure of the intestines, or who reflected on their irritabi∣lity, would have advised such a violent heating remedy to such nervous parts, already in a state of inflammation.</NOTE>; which greatly irritated the inflamed part, and after this, a purulent matter as well as blood was discharged, which proved exceedingly relaxing. The practitioners consulted, finding the rectum ul∣cerated, and after exerting their utmost efforts to remove the complaint, persuaded the patient, as is too common, that the discharge was healthful, and carried off other bodily disorders. Upon ex∣amination afterwards, it was declared, by a very eminent surgeon, that there was a large fungus in the intestine, but that no operation could prove useful. Depending on the opinions given, and the reputation of the practitioners consulted, the misery was bore with the greatest fortitude, there not appearing the least hopes of relief. Having seen the successful treatment of M. S. mentioned Case XXVI, this lady was induced to apply to me, Sept. 8, 1774. The countenance was very pale, the whole body was exceedingly relaxed, with a great languor of spirits, and a hectical look;
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>twice in a day was discharged a cupful of blood and fetid matter. The opinion I gave to the friends, was, that the rectum was ulcerated, that it would be impossible to determine whether relief could be obtained; upon the whole, that any suc∣cess was doubtful. A trial was made. Ten grains of the pulvis mineralis were at first given, which agreed perfectly well, and every week the dose was increased, until twenty-five grains were taken four times a day, for six weeks. Nourishing diet, rather of the animal gelatinous kind was recom∣mended. In about two months the discharge had considerably diminished; the patient continued the powders, with one grain of the calx antimonii, and had the inexpressible pleasure of finding the ulcer healed, both discharges had ceased in nine months. This lady has remained perfectly well ever since, which is now above four years; but has taken occasionally the sal neutralis and the pulvis mineralis since the cure, by her own desire.</P>

<P>MRS. C. had, for above one year and a half, suffered extreme misery, from a schirrus and ulcer of the uterus. The first practitioners in London had been consulted, and after trying various reme∣dies, as opiates, laxatives, hemlock, &amp;c. gave up the case as lost. The pains were acute, and de∣prived the patient of rest; the schirrus was large, pressing both on the rectum and neck of the blad∣der, occasioning a difficulty in the expulsion of urine and the feces; a fetid, purulent and acri∣monious matter was discharged in great quanti∣ties, very offensive, and evidently of the cancer∣ous kind. Sometimes the pains were equal to the strongest labor pains; the whole body was greatly
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>emaciated, and the patient had not been able to sit up for many months. The pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis, with one grain of the calx. antimonia, were given three times in the day, and the use of opiates entirely left off. In the course of six weeks, during which time the symptoms daily decreased, the patient could sit up; the re∣medies were continued for about three months more, and all the complaints were nearly remov∣ed. About this time I went abroad, was gone for near three months, and on my return found that no one complaint remained, except some lit∣tle discharge and weakness. The medicines were still continued, with the julep. e camphor. and there was every reason to conclude the patient nearly cured. Some time after, however, came on a violent diarrhoea, which proved fatal.</P>
<P>When an ulcer accompanies a swelling and hardness of the womb, the prospects of cure are doubtful; in many such instances the reme∣dies, however, have afforded a very com∣fortable relief for years, and kept the patients from those intolerable pains, which must strike every humane spectator with horror, when the common modes of treatment are alone pursued.</P>
<P>It is reasonable to conclude, that, what gives such extraordinary relief in desperate cases, and which in some instances has proved a positive cure, would in general prevent these complaints at a certain time of life; or when the disorders first make their appearance.</P>
<P>Practitioners in general, and all authors, either an∣cient or modern, have considered these uterine com∣plaints incurable; upon this principle, when the disorder is discovered, they often persuade the suffering patient, that nothing more than the ad∣ministration of palliatives can be done. I have
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>often been called in, after much mischief has been done by improper practices; where there remain∣ed not the least probability of affording relief; nay, sometimes but a few hours before death, and then it has been with exultation reported, but with what degree of candor or humanity let the world judge, that the patient has died under my care.</P>

<P>MR. C—, at St. James's Palace, had been a long time afflicted with a large spongy excres∣cence, almost surrounding the sphincter ani; a very considerable discharge issued from the rectum, exceedingly acrimonious, which inflamed the skin wherever it came in contact; several parts were likewise coroded, and formed a number of small ulcers, not only in the perineum, but likewise in the posterior part above the anus, causing most exquisite torture night and day. When the faeces were evacuated, a prolapsus, or falling down of the intestine happened. He had applied for relief to the most able practitioners, laxatives had been administered, lotions, unguents, &amp;c. without any advantage. The misery he experienced was inex∣pressible. He took a solution of pure nitre, join∣ed with the mercurius corrosivus sublimatus, in very small doses. The sal neutralis was likewise occasionally given, with the aethiops mineralis.

<P>H. F—, Esq; a married gentleman, had an ob∣struction in the urethra, arising from excrescences, and a schirrus of the prostrate gland. Bougies had been used a considerable time without remov∣ing the complaint. The patient was frequently under the necessity of having the urine drawn off by means of a catheter; the most exquisite pain accompanied the discharge of urine, which issued in drops, and from the contracting and expulsive efforts of the bladder, joined with the resistance near its neck, the most inexpressible misery was experienced; and this happened very often; for there seemed, almost, a constant irritation of the parts. All diuretics and emollients had exaspera∣ted the symptoms; by promoting the secretion of urine in a disorder which resisted powerfully its evacuation. A costiveness prevailed, and most cathartics irritated. Solid meat was sure to cause pain; a milk diet had been persisted in by the advice of a physician, and the solvent medicines had been administered under the care of a reputa∣ble surgeon, but without success. On passing a small bougie, I perceived a slight resistance, as nigh as could be conjectured, within half an inch of the prostrate grand; on pushing on the bougie, another powerful resistance was felt near the last mentioned part. Concluding that the first oppo∣sition was from an excrescence, and the last from an induration, and enlargment of the prostrate gland;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whoever perfectly comprehends the anatomical situation of the parts affected, it is hoped will not condemn this con∣clusion; it must be confessed the case did not admit of demon∣stration.</NOTE> some hopes were suggested that what had
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>so effectually removed other glandular complaints, might prove beneficial in this. The pilula rubra was given, at first, in the dose of half a grain, four times in the day, and persisted in for near three weeks, without any advantage, except that the urine was discharged with rather more ease, and the inclination to evacuate it was more distant in point of time. A solution of camphor, with the essentia volatilis, and the eighth of a grain of a well prepared mercurius corr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sivus sublimatus were administered after each pill, which last was given in the dose of a grain; a mercurial ointment, charged with camphor, was rubbed into the pe∣rineum, and a fumigation of cinnabar was used every night previous to anointing. The effects were beyond expectation; for in three weeks after the urine was discharged with ease, small sloughs passed daily through the urethra, rather fibrous, putrid, and scarce more tenacious than coagulated blood. The remedies, except the ointment, were continued for three months, and a perfect cure was the consequence.</P>

<P>The Lady of a Member of the House of Com∣mons, aged 43, had an enlargement and induration of the womb, with a discharge which indicated an ulceration of the part. This complaint had been of two years standing, and the patient previous to that time had been attacked with frequent and immoderate floodings. A court physician, not a practiser in midwifery, ordered the most astringent remedies, as the bark, elixir of vitriol, tincture of roses, &amp;c. These injudicious methods of treat∣ment, by checking the efforts of nature to relieve

I attempted an alleviation of the symptoms, and, in great measure, succeeded, by giving the essentia volatilis and the pulvis mineralis in small doses ter de die. In a few weeks, however, pains came on, with contractions of the womb, similar to those of labor: great quantities of coagulated masses of the polypous kind were expelled, which had most probably been detained in the uterus ever since the floodings, when those very powerful astringents had been used; for vitriolic acids have frequently this property. In a few days the discharge became exceedingly putrid, and the disorder put a period to the patient's existence.</P>

He had caught cold, and a soreness was perceived on the lower part and side of the nose, with inflammation and a dark red appearance; it was first washed with a solution of nitre. Afterwards a surgeon recom∣mended some mercurial pills, but no success at∣tending the use of the remedies, he applied to a physician of an hospital, who ordered the hem∣lock in pills, gradually increasing the dose, till six∣teen were taken in twenty four hours for a length of time, by which his memory was affected. Two consultations of physicians and surgeons were had, and it was concluded on, to give him a solu∣tion of mercury, with the sarsaparella decoction. This was persevered in for near five months; but the disorder grew worse, and had spread itself all over the internal surface of the nose; a part of the cheek near the left ala of the nose was like∣wise hardened in several little swellings, about the size of grey pease, of a very dark red colour, which afterwards became ulcerous. Despairing of obtaining any relief from the regular practitioners, he unhappily was induced to apply to one of those

She was advised, very properly, by an eminent surgeon, not to suffer the use of injec∣tions, or any other applications; as in so delicate an organ, that fine membrane, the tympanum, might be probably destroyed, as likewise the little bones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malleus, incus and stapes.</NOTE>, which form part of the mechanical struc∣ture of this curious organ. Satisfied with this opi∣nion, nothing was attempted for years; but the discharge continued, and was at times very offen∣sive. This lady had a fever in August 1774, of the putrid kind, with ulcerations in the throat, for which I was consulted. It terminated happily by the use of the common anteseptic remedies; as bark, elixir of vitriol, vinegar drinks, &amp;c. &amp;c. After recovery, the discharge from the ear was remarkably more offensive than before. This circumstance was communicated to me. A fumi∣gation of cinnabar factitium and aethiops minera∣lis p. e. was used, by means of a proper tube every other evening to the part. Internally twice in the day was taken the pulvis mineralis, to which was added a larger portion of the aethiops, and some aethiop. antim This plan was continued for near three months, during which time the dis∣charge gradually decreased, and entirely lost its offensive smell. The powders were then directed without the fumigation; the ulcer was soon after entirely healed; the wax was secreted; and the
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>hearing perfectly restored. No return of this complaint hath since happened.</P>
<P>Some other instances of the same sort have oc∣curred, where the fumigation has been very effi∣cacious, as it commonly is in foul ulcers, unat∣tended with inflammation.</P>

<P>MR. Whittaker, No. 2, Mercer Street, Long Acre, was seized on August 1, 1773, with a violent inflammation and pain of the left eye. Conserve of roses was applied at first, and a purge taken; then a lotion was used of the vitriolic kind until the 10th; when the pain and inflamma∣tion continuing, he was advised to apply alum powdered, with the yolk of an egg; and on the following day he found he had totally lost his sight.

<P>A CHILD four years old, daughter of Mrs. Williams, recommended by the overseers of St. Giles's in the year 1773, had lost her sight one year, from an inflammation in cutting her teeth. When the child was but eighteen months old, an inflammation of the eyes proved very troublesome; for which a physician, reputedly skilful in the cure of childrens diseases, was consulted; but no benefit was received from his prescription. A very emi∣nent practitioner was consulted in the present in∣stance; who ordered a fomentation of white rose leaves, to be used two hours in the day, and a powder to be blowed into the eyes. This plan was continued three months, and a lotion was used. Six leeches were applied to the inner angles of the eye, and repeated twice; but no relief was obtain∣ed. Application was then made to a celebrated foreigner; who ordered an issue in the arm, and an ounce of magnesia to be taken in a week. A physician at an hospital ordered a blister and an emetic. Finding no good effects from his pre∣scription, he declared the disorder to be the king's evil, and that no relief could be expected until the girl reached her fourteenth year. When I first saw the child, she had been blind above nine months; the cornea of both eyes was opake, but there was no discharge. The pulvis mineralis was given for six weeks every two hours in the day-time, without any apparent benefit. On the 9th week the cornea seemed to be nearly transparent; but the child could not bear any light without ex∣quisite tortures: the same remedies were con∣tinued one week longer. Perceiving then that no∣thing could impede the rays of light, in passing

<P>MRS. B—, Marybone, aged 78, had been for between thirty and forty years, experien∣cing great misery from an ulcer of the leg, si∣tuated a little above the ancle. It was not large, but the surrounding parts were callous, itched in∣tolerably, the discharge was acrimonious; there were several scorbutic eruptions in different parts; the pains were acute, and almost constant. Various had been the means used to cure, or to relieve this complaint. Sometimes by rest and medicine it had been healed; but, as is common, on exercise soon broke out again. For several years the pa∣tient had been advised to bear patiently the pain∣ful disorder, under the specious pretence of its being necessary, as a drain for all bad humors. To cure a person so far advanced in years, might make the disorder fly to the head, and destroy the senses; or bring on a fever, or a cough, which would prove fatal. By such artifices, which are too commonly practised, when surgeons cannot cure an ulcer, was the patient persuaded to suffer in∣expressible misery for so many years. The pulvis

In six weeks an evident altera∣tion for the better was produced, the itching be∣ing allayed, and the eruptions cured.

When first I inspected the case, there were at least forty ulcers in different parts of the leg, foul, offensive to the smell, discharging a very acrid matter. There were swellings and inflammation, and the pain was ex∣quisite, constantly depriving the patient of rest.

It is highly proba∣ble, in these complaints, that some part of a scor∣butic, or putrid acrimony, issuing from the sore, is daily absorbed and conveyed to the blood and other juices by the lymphatic vessels, and the whole habit is, by these means, contaminated. <HI>A bad constitution is the general cause of the ul∣cer, this afterwards becomes the cause of a worse constitution; and while this reciprocal ac∣tion is in force, the ulcer will be in no disposition to heal.</HI> Whatever can gradually and impercep∣tibly restore the fluids to a mild balsamic state, and regulate the secretions and excretions, will be found beneficial in removing these scorbutic dis∣tempers, so predominant in this country. It may be a matter, perhaps, worthy the consideration of the surgeons of hospitals, whether such rational methods of cure should not be embraced, which would save those public charities a large annual expence. Experience confirms, that ninety five at least out of a hundred may be radically cured as out-patients, at the same time obtain their livelihood by industry. A moderate exercise is so far from retarding the cure, that it facilitates it, and renders the afflicted less liable to a relapse.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>SOME may possibly imagine, that the common unsuccessful modes of treatment have been too freely censured; but, let it be considered, that until erroneous systems are exploded, no new discoveries, however important, can be established.</P>
<P>It gives me inexpressible pleasure to find, that several eminent practitioners, and some at the pub∣lic hospitals, have adopted these new modes of treatment, and have candidly acknowledged, that considerable success has attended their endea∣vors. The opposition the modes have experienced from others, may have arisen from their being strongly prepossessed in favour of the practice they have been accustomed to. The facts here pro∣duced, it is presumed, will convince them of their errors, and be the best answer to whatever may have been advanced against the doctrines.</P>
<P>Though the hasty adoption of novelties has fre∣quently been productive of evils in the healing art; yet, an inflexible adherence to erroneous maxims, has proved a check to philosophical en∣quiry; a bar to every useful improvement. The cases here related, the result of many years appli∣cation, are respectfully submitted to the public consideration, and particularly to the unprejudiced and learned practitioners in medicine; who will best determine, whether they merit attention. The curative methods are, still, it is presumed, capable of much improvement, and the same dis∣position which gave rise to the discoveries, shall not be wanting to prosecute so desirable a purpose.</P>

<P>The ulcerated legs, the opacity of the cornea, partially, or totally impeding vision, scorbutic, and schrophulous cases, are proved, in general, to be curable. It could be ardently wished, that the same might be asserted, with equal confidence, in confirmed cancerous diseases. These ravaging complaints, however, if not too far advanced, can frequently be removed. When poisonous re∣medies have been administered, or other violent practices adopted, little success can be expected; and often the cure is as impossible, as in the aneu∣rism of the aorta. The barbarous use of escha∣rotics, and the unfeeling and improper use of the knife, have been condemned, in all ages, by every physician of integrity and experience; as they have hastened the progress of the cancer, and the dis∣solution of the patient.</P>
