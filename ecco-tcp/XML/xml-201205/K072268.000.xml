<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>RUPTURES of the uterus have been considered as accidents, mor∣tal, for the most part, in their nature. When part of the child remains <HI>in ute∣ro,</HI> authors give some general directions for delivery; but agree in its fatal ten∣dency, if the child has escaped wholly into the cavity of the abdomen; con∣sidering any attempts to deliver, except by the caesarean operation, as fruitless. This was the opinion of Dr. Hunter: his high and deserved reputation has stampt such authority upon it, that prac∣titioners in general give up their patient for lost, without attempting any thing
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>for her relief. The caesarian operation, in this country, has been attended with such ill success, that very few men are bold enough to recommend it, suppo∣sing that it would only be an addition to the patient's sufferings, without af∣fording any prospect of relief.</P>
<P>Dr. Douglas, physician to the Asylum, some months since, published a case, where he succeeded in the delivery of a child from the cavity of the abdomen, and the woman recovered; from whence he infers, that those accidents, which admit the child to escape through a rupture of the uterus, are not neces∣sarily fatal, and that the delivery is to be effected, without having recourse to the caesarean operation, with more ease than has been imagined.</P>
<P>The case, which is now submitted to the consideration of the public, was a laceration of the vagina, happening early in parturition: the circumstances
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>of which having been clearly marked during the life of the patient, and con∣firmed by dissection after her death, throws a new light upon this part of midwifery, and renders it probable that many cases deemed irremediable, from being considered as ruptures of the ute∣rus, were only lacerations of the vagi∣na, and admitted of effectual assistance from art.</P>
<P>This case, having given rise to many doubts upon the subject of ruptured uterus, induced me to enquire how far authors in general have been accurate in their observations. Upon examining such cases as were in my possession, I found, that many which are related as ruptures of the uterus, were in fact, la∣cerations of the vagina. Instances of which I shall give in cases from Vander Wiel, Bonetus, Dr. Douglas, Pouteau, and others.</P>
<P>From a case communicated to me by a friend, I am further enabled to give
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>some account of the circumstances at∣tending a laceration of the vagina, when, the head being so low as to be wedged in the pelvis, the child did not escape into the cavity of the abdomen. On examining the circumstances of some cases described as proceeding from rup∣tures of the uterus, this appears some∣times to have happened without being discovered.</P>
<P>The observations annexed, respecting the circumstances in which lacerations of the vagina differ from ruptures of the uterus; in the escape of the child or placenta into the abdomen, and the obstructions to delivery; and the other practical inferences drawn, are such as, I hope, will merit the attention of prac∣titioners.</P>
<P>As Dr. Douglas's observations on an extraordinary case of ruptured uterus, is the latest publication on the subject, I shall have occasion to advert to it
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>oftener than to any other. If it has been any means of dispelling the idea of the impossibility of recovery in acci∣dents of this nature, which has so long been the general received opinion, sup∣ported by the highest authorities; I flat∣ter myself, that the following pages will be a further inducement to dispel our fears; as they tend to prove the great probability there is, that the escape of the child into the cavity of the abdo∣men happens oftener from lacerations of the vagina, than from ruptures of the uterus.</P>

<HEAD><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>N EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF LACERATED VAGINA.</HEAD>
<P>ON August the 20th, 1786, I was desired by Mr. William Waller, of Gosport, to visit Mrs. Wilkins, with my partner Mr. Aylward. She was a patient of Mr. Waller's, and had been above twenty four hours in labour; after the membranes had broke, and the os internum been considerably di∣lated, the labour pains suddenly went off; the child's head could be no longer felt, and very dangerous symptoms had come on. We met there, in consulta∣tion, his father and Dr. Waller.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<P>Mrs. Wilkins was a large woman, much used to laborious exercise, of a dark complexion, about thirty-six years of age, inclining to be lusty; her consti∣tution was naturally strong, and general∣ly healthy; she was then in labour with her fourth child; her former labours had been always lingering, but was, at each time, delivered of a living child, without more than ordinary assistance. During the present pregnancy, she was not able to move with so much ease as with her former children, complaining of much pain in the left hypogastrium.</P>
<P>We were informed by Mr. Waller, that he was called to her assistance about a fortnight before; but finding that the pains were spurious, he ordered her an opiate, which gave her relief, and she continued easy until the preceding day; when being again sent to, about six o'clock in the morning, he then found her in labour; after waiting some time, the pains beginning to encrease, he made
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>an examination, and found that the os internum was dilated to the size of a crown piece. The membranes broke, and the waters were evacuated. Upon a further examination in the usual man∣ner, the head was found to present; but being only able to reach it with the point of his finger, he could not exactly ascertain its situation, in respect to ver∣tex or fontinel. Considering it a linger∣ing labour, he waited for the efforts of nature. The child's head advanced by slow degrees; and, after some hours, the prospect of a more speedy delivery seemed to be apparent, by the further dilatation of the os internum, although the head did not appear to be much engaged in the pelvis. She was, about this time, seized with a cramp in her left foot and leg, which afterwards ex∣tended to her belly, on the return of every pain. While he was directing a camphorated anodyne liniment, ano∣ther severe pain came on, which caused her to cry out most vehemently, oh the
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>cramp, the cramp! and which, she af∣terwards said, she believed was in her womb: this was soon after followed by a discharge of blood from the vagina, which continued for some time.</P>
<P>Mr. Waller then observed that the la∣bour pains abated in their strength, and that they were succeeded by such as are common in colic, with peculiar twist∣ing in her bowels. He directed an emol∣lient glyster, which was repeated with an anodyne; but not finding so much relief from these as he expected, her pulse being full and quick, he took away about eight ounces of blood from her arm, and left her about two o'clock, giving directions, that she might be kept as cool as possible, the weather being very warm.</P>
<P>He saw her again, between four and five o'clock, and found that the true labour pains had not returned; but that, in addition to the other symp∣toms,
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>she then complained of consider∣able thirst; had vomited frequently; was very restless; in great pain when moved, and felt a great degree of pain when he put his hand upon her belly. Upon examining the state of the labour, he could feel no presentation, the child's head having receded. In this situation, he thought it proper to repeat the glys∣ter, and ordered her, in the evening, another anodyne, together with a saline julep. With hopes that real and effi∣cient pains would return by the morn∣ing, he left her.</P>
<P>On visiting her in the morning, very early, her attendants informed him, that she had been very thirsty and restless all night; her vomiting had been more se∣vere, and that she was in great pain when turned, complaining of a heavy lump which sell from side to side; it did not appear from an inspection of the cloths, that there had been any fur¦ther hemorrhage; upon inquiring more
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>par∣ticularly, it could not be found that she had made any urine, except as it came away involuntarily.</P>
<P>On considering that there had been no return of real pains, and that the other symptoms were more urgent, he began to think that her case was of a more serious nature than he had at first apprehended; he therefore thought it proper, to acquaint her friends with the opinion he entertained of the danger of her situation, requesting them to send for such other persons of the faculty as they might wish should be consulted.</P>
<P>When we visited her, which was about noon, we found her extremely restless, complaining of great pain about the region of the pubis; her face was covered with a cold sweat; her pulse was moderately full and ra∣pid; she felt great anxiety about the praecordia; her breathing was thick and short, with intense thirst, and continual
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>efforts to vomit. As it was observed that she had made no water for some time, except what, by the urinous smell of the cloths, appeared to have come away involuntarily, we determined to introduce the catheter; but no∣thing passed, except a little bloody sanies. The bleeding was repeated, and an antiphlogistic treatment agreed upon.</P>
<P>When we considered her situation more fully, and compared the several symptoms, of cramp and succeeding hemorrhage; the retrocession of the child; her severe thirst; vomiting and great pain about the region of the pu∣bis, with the symptoms which occurred in the case of ruptured uterus published by Dr. Douglas; there was such simi∣larity between them, that we agreed in the propriety of introducing the hand for a more particular examination.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<P>We accordingly visited her again about three o'clock, and Mr. William Waller proceeded to make an exami∣nation. There was no difficulty in pas∣sing his hand: upon the posterior part he felt a considerable tumor, which was moveable, and which was not the child's head: he likewise found his hand in contact with the intestines; whence it was evident that our suspicions were well grounded. Immediate delivery was the only means of relief, and his endeavours to get at the feet soon suc∣ceeded; they were brought into the vagina, and secured with a noose; but it required a considerable degree of ex∣ertion to disengage the breech. After the arms were brought down, the head followed with ease, little or no dis∣charge ensuing.</P>
<P>The child was large, and had been dead, no doubt, ever since its escape from the uterus. The placenta, which
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>was likewise in the cavity of the ab∣domen, followed without any diffi∣culty.</P>
<P>Not being determined as to the na∣ture of the tumor, which Mr. Waller felt upon the posterior part; as the woman had suffered so little in deli∣very, we concurred in opinion, that he should again examine the state of the parts. Upon introducing his hand, he soon sound that the tumor receded be∣fore his fingers, and that it was the contracted uterus. It was evident to him that the uterus was not ruptured; but that there was a laceration of the vagina, at the place where it is attached to the <HI>cervix uteri,</HI> through which his hand would pass with ease into the ca∣vity of the abdomen. The os internum was so contracted, that it would not ad∣mit more than two fingers, and he was convinced that it had not been injured. She sound herself considerably relieved when we lest her at four o'clock. An
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>anodyne was directed to be taken in the evening.</P>
<P>— 21st.—We visited her early in the morning, when we found that her spirits were good. Her attendants in∣formed us, that she had passed a much better night than could have been ex∣pected. She was capable of turning without any inconvenience; her thirst, pain in the abdomen, and vomiting, were still violent. Anodynes, with salt of wormwood and lemon juice, to be taken during the effervescence, were di∣rected for her. She had frequent stools with tenesmus. The nurse was ordered to let her drink be mint tea with rice gruel.</P>
<P>The symptoms evidently arising from the injury done to the abdominal vis∣cera, by the child's remaining so long among them, after its escape from the uterus, induced us to entertain some rays of hope, from the success which
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>had attended the case related by Dr. Douglas, that she might recover; but the approach of the evening convinced us that our hopes were groundless. Every symptom was become more ur∣gent, with a very distressing sense of suffocation from globus hystericus; she had made no water, and, from the uri∣nous smell of the cloths, we could not entertain the least doubt but that the bladder was ruptured, specially when we called to our recollection, that the same had been observed before delivery.</P>
<P>In this distressing state, nothing was lest for us to do, more than to alleviate her pain, and make the small remainder of her life as easy as possible; for which purpose, her anodyne medicines were repeated.</P>
<P>—22d.—The persons who watched with her during the night informed us, that she had been very restless; com∣plained of great pain in her belly, with
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>intense thirst, and that she had been constantly vomiting. Her countenance was greatly altered; the quantity of fluid thrown up was out of all propor∣tion to the quantity drank; the tenesmus still continued, but without any evacu∣ations; her anodynes were repeated, and an opiate glyster ordered to be in∣jected in the evening.</P>
<P>—23d.—We found her more com∣posed, and we understood she had been so through the greater part of the night. She continued in the same state until about eleven o'clock before noon, when she died, perfectly sensible.</P>
<P>We obtained permission to open the body the same evening.</P>
<P>The abdomen was much tumified. Upon making a longitudinal incision through the integuments, a quantity of confined air rushed out. The perito∣neum was inflamed, and in some places beginning to sphacelate. The intestines
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>were remarkably distended with flatus; their external coats were tinged with yellow, and inflamed through their whole extent. The ramifications of the vessels appeared of a beautiful red, as if they had been injected; some spots were observed in several places beginning to sphacelate, and they were for the most part connected by a slight adhesion to each other. The omentum was con∣tracted and inflamed. There was a con∣siderable quantity of bloody serum in the cavity of the abdomen. The whole of the viscera had that appearance, which has been generally observed on dissecting women who have died of a puerperal fever.</P>
<P>The uterus and its appendages, in situ, appeared perfectly sound, excepting the left ovarium, which contained about fourteen ounces of a colourless fluid, in a single cyst. There was no appearance of the <HI>vesica urinaria;</HI> on passing a ca∣theter, it went immediately into the ca∣vity
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>of the abdomen, confirming our suspicion that the bladder was ruptured. On raising the uterus above the pelvis, we were immediately convinced how accurate Mr. Waller had been in the description he gave us, on examining the state of the parts directly after de∣livery.</P>
<P>The os internum and cervix uteri were uninjured; the vagina was thin, and was lacerated transversely on the superior part, close to its attachment to the uterus: the laceration was nearly through one half of its circumference, on the fore part, but inclining to the left side. The bladder, from its connexion with the vagina, had suffered at the same time, being ruptured through the whole of its posterior part, at least in propor∣tion to the size of the laceration which had taken place in the vagina; we ob∣served that it had extended to the outer surface of the uterus, tearing off an an∣gular piece of its peritoneal coat, about
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>half an inch in length. The uterus was contracted to the usual size it is ob∣served to be, in so short a space after delivery; its peritoneal coat near the fundus shewed an appearance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uci∣pient mortification. The os <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was contracted, as Mr. Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> served, so that, without di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> could not introduce more than two fingers.</P>
<P>As the nature of the case was evident, we did not proceed further in the dis∣section, but contented ourselves with preserving the parts. On making an in∣cision into the uterus, it was found, in most places, to be nearly an inch thick; its internal surface appearing in a heal∣thy state, and contained a small propor∣tion of the membrana decidua, which had been left behind.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
<P>LACERATIONS of the vagina have been mentioned by authors, as, sometimes, happening from labori∣ous parturition; but I do not recollect to have heard, or read any account, where the child had escaped, by such means, into the cavity of the abdomen; or that they have ever conceived such an accident to be probable. I have se∣lected some cases, which are related as ruptures of the uterus, but which are apparently accidents of this nature. Thus can be reconciled, only, by the confusion into which authors have fal∣len, in their divisions of this viscus.</P>
<P>Anatomists, at present, are pretty nearly agreed in dividing the uterus in∣to fundus, cervix, and os internum. Supposing that the whole of the uterus measures three inches in length, they,
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>for the most part, allow the fundus to oc∣cupy the space of one inch and a quar∣ter, the cervix to take up one inch and three quarters, and the os internum to project within the vagina about a quar∣ter of an inch. But, when we consider how indeterminate they have heretofore been on this subject, we shall not be surprised, on examining some of the following cases, which are related as ruptures of the cervix, to find them la∣cerations of the vagina. From the con∣current testimony of writers, it is evi∣dent, that the vagina has been fre∣quently considered as the <HI>collum uteri.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Case of lacerated, vagina from <HI>VAN∣DER WEIL,</HI> related, by him as a rup∣ture of the uterus.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE daughter of Jonas Pergo had been delivered of four children, having very difficult labours with all of them. While pregnant with the fifth, she suf∣fered a considerable degree of uneasi∣ness; her pains were much more ur∣gent, when in labour, and came on earlier than in her former pregnancies, continuing with violence until the third day before delivery, when they ceased. The midwife could not, by any endea∣vours, deliver her. The child, which was supposed to have been dead some
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>days, and which appeared afterwards to have been the case, from the separa∣tion of the cuticle, presented with its hands bent behind its neck, and the face obliquely upwards towards the pubis.</P>
<P>The symptoms becoming more and more violent, she being not only faint and feverish, with oppression on the praecor∣dia, attended with rigors; but having vomited up some green faeces, which arose, he says, from the foetus pressing upon the rectum, so that they could not find their passage thence, Cornelius Solingius, an experienced surgeon, was sent for with him to her relief. In a short time, he delivered her of a dead child. As he could not easily bring away the after birth, he introduced his hand along the funis, but found that it was in contact with the intestines, before it came to the placenta; which was sound, soon after, hanging down, in three parts, within the abdomen, out
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>of the uterus. From the child having been expelled three days, the uterus was so hard and contracted, that, at first, he supposed it to be a scirrhus. He separated the placenta from the u∣terus, to which, he says, it still adher∣ed. The cartilage, which connected the bones of the pelvis, was soft, and they were separated from each other nearly the breadth of a finger.</P>
<P>The woman died the same day, and the body was opened on the next, in the presence of Vander Weil and his brother.</P>
<P>The abdomen was much tumified. On making an incision into it, nothing escaped except a quantity of foetid air, and some coagulated blood of a good colour, which came, he says, from the cotyledons, or mouths of the vessels of the uterus, at the time when the pla∣centa was detached from it. He passed his hand through the vagina, and again
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>found himself in contact with the intes∣tines, the uterus receding above the pubis. A rupture was observed at the inferior and posterior part, just above the os internum, at that place where the common membrane from the peritone∣um covers and surrounds the uterus, as well as the rectum; through which rup∣ture the whole of the child, except the parts which presented, had passed into the cavity of the abdomen. This he assigns as the cause why the pains ceased, and the mother became easier, a few days before delivery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stalpaart Vander Wiel, observ. rar. med. cent. prim. obs. lxvi.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the examination of this case, I shall confine my remarks to the delivery of the placenta, and the appearances upon dissection.</P>
<P>After the child was delivered, Solin∣gius, finding that the placenta did not easily follow, introduced his hand along
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>the funis, with an intention to extract it, but found himself in contact with the intestines, the placenta being, '<HI>ex∣tra uterum,</HI>' in the cavity of the abdo∣men. The uterus, from which he sup∣poses the child to have escaped some days before, was contracted, and felt so hard, '<HI>ita ut initio scirrhum crederet.</HI>' In the next sentence, he speaks of sepa∣rating the placenta from the uterus: this cannot be reconciled with what he had before related, of the placenta being '<HI>extra uterum,</HI>' otherwise than by sup∣posing that the placenta, while in the abdomen, adhered to the external sur∣face of the uterus; its adhesion to the surface of the viscera, in some other cases, having been found to be very considerable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Douglas's case of rupt. uterus, p. 36. Boneti se∣pulchret. anatom. lib. iii. sect. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A review of the circumstances, which follow the introduction of his hand, will elucidate the case, when compared
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>with the appearances, which were ob∣served on opening the body, after death.</P>
<P>In the first place. No mention is made of any difficulty in introducing the hand through the os internum into the cavity of the uterus, which must have been considerable, from its con∣tracted state, if the attempt had been made.</P>
<P>Secondly. As his hand came imme∣diately in contact with the intestines, if the placenta had been within the uterus, the intestines must likewise have been within it, which does not by any means appear from the narrative.</P>
<P>And lastly. If his hand had been within the cavity of the uterus, how could he have judged of the degree of its contraction, so as to have thought it, at first, to have been a scirrhus?</P>
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
<P>If we consider the case as a partial separation of the vagina, from its at∣tachment to the <HI>cervix uteri,</HI> then every one of these objections are surmounted with ease: his hand, on passing along the funis, would have found an easy in∣troduction into the cavity of the abdo∣men, and he would have been in con∣tact with the intestines, before his hand arrived at the placenta. The uterus would have been found on the anterior part, and have felt contracted like a ball, so that, at first, it might have been mistaken for a scirrhus; neither of which could have possibly happened if his hand had been within its cavity: besides, his expression is so clear, in respect to its contraction, 'dure admo∣dum compactum atque <HI>in se</HI> contrac∣tum comperit,' as to leave no room to suppose any thing to have been included within it.</P>
<P>We find that on dissection, after re∣lating the external appearance of the
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>abdomen, and what issued on making an incision into it, he passed his hand, he says, <HI>per vulvam,</HI> and again felt the intestines; and, what is very material in forming a determination on the na∣ture of the case, found the uterus re∣ceding above the pubis, '<HI>recedentemque</HI> supra os pubis uterum reperit.' To use the expression of Dr. Douglas, in his late, publication, <Q>'it fled before the tips of his fingers.'</Q></P>
<P>I think it must be evident to every one, that the uterus would not have re∣ceded before his hand, if its attachment to the vagina had remained entire. It must have resisted the touch.</P>
<P>The place where the rupture is said to have been was at the inferior and posterior part, a little above the os in∣ternum, where the common peritoneal membrane is continued from the rectum to the uterus.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
<P>Now the same peritoneal coat which surrounds the whole of the abdominal viscera, in its passage from the rectum to become the external coat of the ute∣rus, is inflected over that part of the vagina which is attached to the <HI>cervix uteri,</HI> beginning to form the peritoneal coat of the uterus, at the place where the vagina is joined to the cervix, a little above the os internum. In the same place, on the anterior part, the vagina was lacerated in the case before related; and, I think, on comparing the different parts of Vander Wiel's rela∣tion, with each other, it is clear that the injury, in both cases, was nearly similar; the only difference being, that in one the laceration was in the posterior, and in the other in the anterior part of the vagina.</P>

<P>On opening the body, they were very cautious in making their incision into the abdomen, that they might have a
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>distinct view of the uterus <HI>in situ.</HI> The muscles were hardly divided, when the back of the child was wounded. They had no suspicion of what it really was, supposing it, at first, to be the u∣terus; but, on continuing the incision, they found it to be a full formed foetus (with signs of putridity from the sepa∣ration of the cuticle) without the uterus, in the cavity of the abdomen. It lay with the face to the sacrum, and its body extended at full length. At first, nothing preternatural was observed, there being no appearance of contu∣sion, wound, ulceration, or abscess. They wondered much at the singularity of the case; but this was cleared up when they sound the uterus torn, rup∣tured, or rather broken off.</P>
<P>The child was still connected by the sunis to the secundines, which were re∣tracted, upon the left side, towards the spleen, and adhered so fast that they had some difficulty to separate them.
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>The uterus was so contracted, that it did not exceed the size of the placenta. Near the cervix, directly under the bladder, there was a portion of mem∣brane hanging down, about the thick∣ness of the dissecting knife, and not exceeding the breadth of half a palm, which was a part of the separated ute∣rus, <HI>'uteri abrupti.'</HI></P>
<P>The rest of the uterus, with its pro∣per orifice, and the secundines were re∣tracted, so that it was totally separated from the cervix, or <HI>'sinus muliebris,'</HI> and all the other parts to which it had before been attached. He attributes this accident to the malconformation of the pubis, which was too much flattened in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oneti sepoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ret, anatom, lib, iii. sect 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The above case requires no comment, as I think it is evident that there was a total separation of the uterus, from its attachment to the vagina.</P>

<P>I remember to have read a case where the same accident happened, from the violent efforts of an accoucheur to in∣troduce his hand to deliver.</P>

<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The case of <HI>Mrs. Manning,</HI> as related by <HI>Dr. DOUGLAS.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE find that the woman, who is the subject of this case, was in her 4th preg∣nancy, low in stature, about 30 years of age, and of a weak constitution, but, in general, healthy. When the Doctor was first called to her, the membranes had been ruptured eight hours, and the pains had continued regular from that time: yet though the os tincae was con∣siderably
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>dilated, the child did not ad∣vance. He found her extremely rest∣less, complaining of excessive pain in the region of the pubis. Each return of pain caused her to writhe and twist as if suffering from violent colic, very unlike the urging throes of common la∣bour; but her pulse was calm and re∣gular, nor did she make any particular complaint, excepting of the pain about the pubis. This being the state of the case, there seemed to be no reason to induce him to precipitate the delivery.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock the same evening, the midwife informed him that the pa∣tient had had a discharge of blood from the vagina, which, however, did not continue; and that the pains had ceased about half an hour after six o'clock; since which, retching, with an incessant craving for drink, had come on.</P>
<P>He now found her face lengthened, and bedewed with cold sweat; her pulse
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>scarcely to be felt; her breathing short and quick, with great anxiety; but still complaining of no pain, excepting about the pubis. <Q>'By examination in the com∣mon way,' he says, I could distinguish nothing, excepting a round moveable substance, which I supposed to be the head of the child; but being only able to reach it with my fingers, I could not determine with any certainty what it was. The woman appeared to be <HI>in extremis;</HI> and my mind was so wholly occupied by her danger, as to preclude all reasoning with respect to the cause.'</Q> He determined upon immediate delive∣ry, as the only chance of relief. <Q>'There was no difficulty,' he says, 'in passing my hand; and the substance which I had supposed to be the child, fled before the tips of my fingers: by following it, I at last found my hand in a cavity, which in no sort resembled that of the uterus. I was then forcibly and painfully struck with the nature of the case; and on ex∣amining all round, with caution and
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>gentleness, I could with certainty de∣termine that my hand was in the cavity of the abdomen: the child being on the fore part; on the back part, the con∣tracted uterus like an oblong ball; and the intestines hanging among any fin∣gers.'</Q> There was no obstruction to the turning and extraction of the child, excepting in the passage of the head through the brim of the pelvis. The placenta, which was likewise in the ab∣dominal cavity, had so clung to the in∣testines, that he was again under the necessity of introducing his hand to de∣tach it, which was not difficult. <Q>'The uterus seemed,' he says, 'to have been ruptured transversely, on the lower and fore part, some distance above where the vagina is connected with it; and it was more contracted in its size, than I thought possible in the few hours which had elapsed since the accident.'</Q></P>
<P>After a variety of changes and alarm∣ing symptoms arising from peritoneal
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>inflammation, the poor woman fortu∣nately recovered; and in about six weeks waited upon the Doctor at his own house, to return thanks; when he persuaded her to permit his neighbour Dr. Osborn to examine <HI>per vaginam.</HI> He thought the os tinae somewhat more open, ex∣ternally, than it usually is; and Dr. Douglas himself fancied he felt rather more fulness than is common about the <HI>cervix uteri:</HI> but they both agreed, that there was nothing in the touch so dif∣ferent from what is observed in the na∣tural state, as to have excited any idea of previous disease, had they not known the complaint with which she had been afflicted.</P>
<P>After examining the body of Mrs. Wilkins, and ascertaining the nature of the injury, I began to consider the above case in a different light, from what I did on the first perusal of it. The Doctor represents it as a case of ruptured ute∣rus;
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>I now perceive it to be a case of lacerated vagina.</P>
<P>The circumstance which he relates, of a <Q>'round moveable substance,'</Q> which upon introducing his hand, he found to be <Q>'the contracted uterus like an ob∣long ball,'</Q> was so similar to what Mr. Waller described, and which every one of us had an opportunity of observing during the dissection, that I have no doubt remaining in my own mind, that there could have been any difference between the two cases. Mr. Waller and the other gentlemen who were present concur likewise with me in the same opinion.</P>
<P>In the preceding pages, I have had occasion, on a review of the case from Vander Weil, to advert to a similar oc∣currence, when I expressed my doubts how the degree of contraction can be ascertained, unless the hand of the ac∣coucheur
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>has been passed on the outside of the uterus. I cannot suppose that, while the fundus is contracted above the rupture, the os internum will remain for several hours, nay days, dilated, and shew no disposition to contract. The fibres, I should apprehend, which form its texture, will assist its contraction in as great a degree as that of the fundus.</P>
<P>Dr. Douglas, as well as Vander Weil, found that the uterus receded on intro∣ducing his hand. Is it possible that the uterus should have receded before his hand, if its attachment had been entire? It must have made some resistance. Yet we find that, when he touched it, it fled, and upon following it, his hand went, not into the uterus, but into a cavity which in no sort resembled it. Can it be supposed from this relation, so point∣edly marked, that his fingers ever passed the os internum? The uterus must have been fixed, if he had entered into its cavity; but he says, that he was obliged
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>to follow it, and at length found his hand within the abdomen, the child being on the fore part, on the back part the contracted uterus, like an oblong ball.</P>

<P>A Case of lacerated vagina from <HI>POU∣TEAU,</HI> related by him as a rupture of the uterus.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HE was called to the assistance of a woman, who had been a considerable time in labour, under the care of a mid∣wife; she had been seized the day be∣fore with a hemorrhage, on which the child, which had before presented with
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>the head, was no longer felt. On exa∣mination, his hand entered at once into a cavity, which appeared large; on the fore part, he felt a round substance, of the size, but not the solidity, of a childs head; yet there was not any thing to be felt, which could assure him of a child being there. The woman died soon af∣ter, without being further examined. On opening the body, the child and placenta were found in the cavity of the abdomen, entirely out of the uterus, which was of the size of a childs head of five years old, and was the round body which had been felt <HI>per vaginam.</HI> The rupture was on the posterior and interior part, and then about three or four inches long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poutean, page 487.</NOTE>.</P>

La Motte observes, that, on dissection, the rupture would not admit the tip of his little finger; and in other cases we find similar remarks. How are we then to account for his finding the rupture to be so very extensive, at a time when the uterus was so much con∣tracted?</NOTE>,'</Q> are con∣sidered, I think that I shall not be too hasty in pronouncing it to have been a separation of the uterus from its poste∣rior attachment to the vagina.</P>

<PB N="49" REF="47"/>the pelvis as to be wedged, before a laceration takes place, it will remain there, and we shall be deprived of one criterion, the retrocession of the pre∣senting part, to guide us; the cessation of the true pains must lead us then to judge of the nature of the case, when attended with vomiting and other symp∣toms, as described in the relation of the preceding narratives. The following cases is an instance of this kind.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A case of lacerated vagina, where the head was engaged in the pelvis, before the accident took place; communi∣cated by a friend.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A. B. aged about 30, was taken in labour with her third child, on April 15th, 1785, at four oclock in the morn∣ing.
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>The waters soon came away. On examination, the head of the child was found to be low in the pelvis. A con∣siderable stricture was observed in the vagina, and the sacrum projected rather forward at its apex. About five hours after she was first taken in labour, she began to complain of pains in her belly, which she distinguished from those of labour. At three oclock in the after∣noon, a physician, an eminent teacher of midwifery in London, was called in, at which time, from the degree of stric∣ture, the part of the head which pre∣sented could not be exactly ascertained. He ordered her an injection, which was given, but without any effect. On en∣quiring, it appeared, that since she be∣gan to complain of the pain in her belly, the labour pains had ceased. A single blade was introduced with ease, and some endeavours made to deliver, but without success. The Doctor, con∣sidering it wrong to struggle against na∣ture, or do any thing without the assis∣tance
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>of pains, left her, giving directions for an enema to be injected, and four or six ounces of blood to be taken away.</P>
<P>He returned at half past five, when very little alteration could be perceived. She had no labour pains, and the pains continued the same in the abdomen, which she now complained was become tender. Injections were ordered, copious and stimulant; four were given without any return. The forceps were at length applied, and used moderately, with an intent to bring on a return of true pains; but a slight discharge of the glysters was the only effect. A little ground was at length gained, and, by encreasing the force for a considerable time, she was delivered of a dead child: the placenta came away immediately after. She made water frequently during the la∣bour, and had it drawn off before the use of the forceps. She was thirsty, and vomited frequently, though little in quantity. By her cries, she did not seem
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>to suffer more pain, than is usually felt in her delivery.</P>
<P>Her pulse were quick after she was in bed; she was disposed to vomit, and passed a restless night; the pain in her belly continued distinct from after pain. She lived until the morning of the 18th, during which time her pulse were gene∣rally 130 or more, her skin hot, she com∣plained of great pain and tenderness of the abdomen; she vomited frequently, and her urgings to vomit were great.</P>
<P>From no local injury being supposed to have happened, and from the pre∣sence of the lochia, and other symp∣toms, the case was considered as truly puerperal, and treated as such.</P>
<P>On dissection, the intestines were found to be inflamed, with an exudation of lymph on their surfaces, and the gall bladder was large and distended with bile. The uterus was contracted to the
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>size of double fist, black, and begin∣ning to sphacelate. The vagina was found to be lacerated at its connexion to the <HI>cervix uteri,</HI> anteriorly, no ves∣tige of the stricture remaining<NOTE PLACE="foot">Although, in the case which gave rise to these ob∣servations, the bladder was unfortunately injured, yet it does not follow, that this must necessarily happen always; for in this case we see, that a laceration may take place on the anterior part, without its being injured; and from other cases we are taught, that the posterior or lateral parts are as often liable to the accident, as the anterior part of the vagina.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is to be observed, that the woman had fallen down, a day or two before she was taken in labour, and that the same gentleman had delivered her, two years before, with forceps, on account of the same stricture.</P>
<P>How far the sixth case quoted by Dr. Douglas might be similar to the above, I have some doubts; but the circumstances attending it render it probable.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="52"/>
<P>It appears, that the woman had been in labour the best part of the day, with very strong pains, before the rupture is supposed to have taken place. The head was firmly wedged in the pelvis; but, in attempting to open it, suddenly gave way to the force applied.</P>
<P>Now, let us consider for one moment the nature of the case. If a rupture had taken place in the uterus, as the head was firmly wedged in the pelvis, the feet must have been the part pro∣truded; whence, when I recollect the strong contractile power of the uterus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When a part of the child only has escaped through a rupture of the uterus, the contraction, as related by authors, is great. Hildanus gives a case where the head of a child had passed through a rupture of the uterus, which had contracted so strongly round its neck, that, he says, it had no doubt been strangled by it.
<P>Hildani Centur. i. observ. 54.</P></NOTE>, and the length of time intervening be∣tween the attempt to open the head, and the time when the rupture is sup∣posed
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>to have happened, I cannot per∣suade myself that the child would have escaped so easy into the cavity of the abdomen as he found it did.</P>
<P>If the vagina was lacerated, it is easy to account for the sudden retrocession of the child. It is evident, that the ute∣rus being only attached in one place, its resistance against the pressure could only be partial; the fundus would be inclined, and the os internum raised in proportion; therefore, when the head was pressed back, it would find an easy admittance, through the laceration, into the cavity of the abdomen; from the endeavours of the uterus to free itself, the body with the placenta would soon follow. The rupture being near the cer∣vix is, I think, some support to what I have advanced. I shall likewise endea∣vour to shew, in another place, that the placenta being in the cavity of the ab∣domen, may be considered as a collate∣ral proof.</P>
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>
<P>I AM inclined to believe, that the whole of the child very seldom escapes from a rupture of the uterus. I am, however, very well convinced, that it is always the consequence of a laceration of the vagina, unless it should happen to be as firmly wedged in the pelvis as in the cases I have just noticed.</P>
<P>On a review of fifteen cases quoted by Dr. Douglas, we shall find, that the child escaped into the cavity of the ab∣domen in seven; in No. VI. VII. X. XI. XII. XIII. and XIV. I have already endeavoured to shew that No. VI. and XI. were lacerations of the vagina, and I shall draw some inferences from No. XII. when I come to speak of the pla∣centa being out of the uterus, tending to show a degree of probability of that being of the same nature. Of No. VII.
<PB N="57" REF="55"/>we have a very uncertain account, as, from motives of delicacy, it is not par∣ticularly entered into. No. X. without doubt, must have been a ruptured ute∣rus. I think that the two last cannot be considered in point, as they were at an early period of gestation, and the acci∣dents happened from external violence.</P>
<P>In the remaining eight, No. I. II. III. IV. V. VIII. IX. and XV. only part of the child had escaped from the rup∣ture; indeed, in the two first, it does not appear that any part had escaped. It is therefore evident that, setting aside the two cases from external violence, in only one out of thirteen the child es∣caped wholly from a rupture of the uterus.</P>
<P>I am also inclined to believe, that the placenta being in the cavity of the ab∣domen, is an occurrence which very sel∣dom happens, excepting in those cases where the vagina is lacerated. The
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>size of the rupture, when it happens in the uterus, must be diminished almost immediately after the child has escaped, and the contraction of the uterus must be encreased by its endeavours to pro∣pel the placenta; it is therefore almost impossible that the placenta should es∣cape into the abdomen: it might indeed sometimes happen, if the funis should be much twisted round the child's neck or body. In almost every case, where we have a certainty that the accident was a rupture of the uterus, we find that the placenta remained behind.</P>
<P>When a laceration takes place in the vagina, the propulsion of the placenta is not different from what happens in common parturition; as every contrac∣tion of the uterus forces it towards the os internum, from whence it passes after the child into the cavity of the abdo∣men. But when there is a rupture in the uterus, every contraction must be an impediment to its propulsion, by di∣minishing
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>the size of the aperture, thro' which it must pass, to be found among the viscera.</P>
<P>In the case of Mrs. Wilkins, where we can entertain no doubt of the nature of the accident, the placenta was found with the child in the cavity of the ab∣domen. In that of Mrs. Manning, in those from Vander Weil, Bonetus, and Pouteau, and in the sixth case quoted by Dr. Douglas, all of which I have en∣deavoured to shew were of the same na∣ture, the placenta was likewise found among the viscera.</P>
<P>There are two more instances, among the cases quoted by Dr. Douglas, where the same occurrence is said to have hap∣pened; in No. X. and XII.</P>
<P>The first, communicated by Dr. Garth∣shore, is against the opinion I have form∣ed, that being, as I have before observed, evidently a rupture of the uterus. In the
<PB N="60" REF="58"/>other, from Saviard, it appears, that the child presented favourably, with every appearance that the labour would be soon finished; yet the pains ceased at once, after two days continuance; the presenting part receded, and only the placenta was to be felt. She died un∣delivered; and when the body was opened, the child and secundines were in the abdomen among the viscera, the feet of the child touching the stomach of the mother. The intestines were all fretted, and the omentum rotten and stinking, but the uterus was of the na∣tural appearance. I have not Saviard's book to refer to; but I think, from a re∣view of this account, I shall be able to draw some inferences in my favour.</P>
<P>From the manner in which he ex∣presses himself, that the uterus was of its natural appearance, we may be led to suppose that no injury had happened to it. When we recollect the circum∣stance, that, after the presenting part
<PB N="61" REF="59"/>had receded, the placenta alone was to be felt, I apprehend but a small degree of doubt concerning the nature of the case will remain.</P>
<P>After the body was opened, the se∣cundines as well as the child were found in the abdomen. As the placenta was to be felt on examination, after the rupture had taken place, how can it be supposed that the rupture was in the uterus? The uterus must have been at that time considerably contracted, and the aperture so much diminished, as to have rendered the escape of the pla∣centa impossible.</P>
<P>Hence I am clearly of opinion, that the placenta being felt on examination, after the rupture had taken place, and being afterwards found in the abdomen, is a great proof that the accident was not in the uterus, but in the vagina.</P>
<PB N="62" REF="60"/>
<P>Out of eight cases, therefore, where the placenta was found with the child in the cavity of the abdomen, there is the greatest probability to suppose that seven of them were lacerations of the vagina.</P>
<P>THE difficulty attending delivery, when the vagina is lacerated, must be very trifling, when compared to that which will occur if the accident hap∣pens in the uterus. In the case of Mrs. Wilkins, the only resistance was in bringing down the breech, which all the gentlemen present agreed arose from the protuberance of the child's belly projecting over the fundus of the contracted uterus; which, as the extrac∣tion went on, was brought lower down, and, of consequence, pressed the breech of the child over the pubis: after this was overcome, not the least difficulty
<PB N="63" REF="61"/>whatever occurred. In the case of Mrs. Manning, it does not appear that there was any resistance to the delivery of the breech; but we find there was a consi∣derable obstruction in the passage of the head through the pelvis. I am some∣what inclined to believe that this might have arisen from the same cause, al∣though Dr. Douglas supposes it to have proceeded from the narrowness of the pelvis.</P>
<P>In those cases, where the uterus has been ruptured, the difficulty will be en∣creased or diminished, in proportion as more or less of the child has escaped into the cavity of the abdomen.</P>
<P>If the rupture should be so extensive as to admit the child to escape entirely out of the uterus, from the natural dis∣position of its fibres, the uterus will al∣most immediately contract, and the size of the rupture will become less, of con∣sequence, in proportion to the degree
<PB N="64" REF="62"/>of contraction which takes place. If the rupture should be so small as to ad∣mit the protrusion of part of the child only, a stricture will be formed upon such part as has escaped, which will re∣quire a considerable degree of force to overcome, as, from its endeavours to expel the part which remains, the ute∣rus will still continue to contract. In performing the caesarean operation, M. Soumain found that the edges of the in∣cision made in the uterus pressed so close upon the foetus, that he could hardly get his fingers in to extract it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. Chirurg. Paris, mem. xx.</NOTE>. Hence we may account for the alternate though ineffectual pains, which, in some cases, have been observed to continue for some time after the rupture has taken place; and I believe we may be led to form a probable opinion that, when this hap∣pens, some part of the child still re∣mains within the uterus.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="63"/>
<P>The hand of the accoucheur, when he sits down to deliver, must be passed through the os internum into the cavity of the uterus, and from thence through the rupture. The difficulty attending the passage of the hand will be in pro∣portion to the degree of contraction; but, unfortunately, it is very seldom that the nature of the case is known so early, as to induce us to make any at∣tempt to deliver before the uterus is considerably contracted. After the re∣sistance from the diminished state of the rupture is overcome, and the hand pas∣sed into the abdomen, the feet, in gene∣ral, may be soon found, and brought down with some ease; but as the ope∣rator proceeds, and the legs come for∣ward, every inch of the child, as the extraction takes place, will create a fresh resistance from its increasing bulk. The irritation which must be given to the uterus, by the introduction of the hand, will increase its endeavours to contract, and make considerable addition to the
<PB N="66" REF="64"/>difficulty. Caldani, of Bologna, in a letter to Haller, relates some experi∣ments made on the uterus of a bitch, which show the great degree of contrac∣tion that takes place even after death, on any stimulus being applied to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Van Swieten's comment. sect. 1316.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The nearer likewise the rupture hap∣pens to the fundus or cervis, the greater degree of ease or difficulty will ensue. In the first instance, the extraction will be made nearly in a direct line. In the other, and which most commonly hap∣pens, that part of the child which re∣mains in the abdomen must form an angle with the feet and legs, while they are passing through the vagina, and the degrees of such angle will be decreased or increased, in proportion as the rup∣ture may happen to be, either near the cervix, or further towards the fundus.</P>
<P>Very little more exertion will be re∣quired than what is obliged to be made
<PB N="67" REF="65"/>use of in a common case, where the child is turned, when the feet are the only parts that have escaped. When the legs have protruded as far as the knee, the resistance will be considera∣bly more powerful; as, in such case, the hand must be passed to a greater distance through the rupture in search of the feet: but how much more must the difficulty be increased, if the aper∣ture should be large enough to admit the child to pass out of the uterus as far as the hips? Indeed I apprehend this situation to be worse than when the whole of the child has escaped; as, in that case, there may be some hope that the resistance might be overcome, and the child extracted by the feet; but when the child has escaped as far as the hips, such a very considerable distension, if not further laceration of the rupture, must take place, and so great a degree of force must be made use of to over∣come the contraction, in order to gain sufficient room to bring the feet back, as
<PB N="68" REF="66"/>leave little room to hope for success. In fact, when I reflect on the very great difficulties that must arise when any considerable part of the child has es∣caped, I do not at all wonder that au∣thors have concurred in pronouncing the accident mortal, and giving no en∣couragement for attempting relief, ex∣cept by having recourse to the caesarean operation.</P>
<P>In addition to Mrs. Manning's case, of which we have had occasion to speak so often, eight others are adduced by Dr. Douglas, to evince the ease with which delivery may be performed in cases of ruptured uterus. No. I. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. and XV. On read∣ing them over with attention, I have observed that the situation of the child, in most of them, was such as to create the smaller degree of resistance, accord∣ing to the opinion I have entertained in respect to the difficulty attending de∣livery.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="67"/>
<P>In the first, which was related to Heis∣ter by Rungius, it does not appear that the child, or any part of it, had ever been in the cavity of the abdomen. Indeed Dr. Douglas is of the same opi∣nion himself, as he says, <Q>'the recovery of the patients, No. I. and II. may have been in a great measure owing to the viscera having sustained little or no in∣jury, as there is no reason to suppose that the child in either case had been in the cavity of the abdomen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Observat. on extr. case of rupt. uter. p. 66.</NOTE>.'</Q> This may give us some idea of the prospect we have of recovery when a rupture takes place, but cannot be brought to show the ease with which delivery may be performed, when the whole or part of the child has escaped from the uterus.</P>
<P>In No. IV. which is taken from La Motte, <HI>observation</HI> 317, the feet were the only parts out of the uterus, and the rupture was at the fundus; whence
<PB N="70" REF="68"/>the extraction was not attended with much difficulty, for two reasons: the endeavours made use of were in a di∣rect line, in the first instance, and in the second, the feet being the only parts that had escaped, the hand of the accou∣cheur was introduced until it came to the knees, so as to bring them down and disengage the feet; after which, no more difficulty would arise than what happens in a common case of turning.</P>
<P>In No. V. likewise from La Motte, <HI>observation</HI> 318, it appears that the child had escaped out of the uterus as far as the hips, or even further, part of the body being in the cavity of the abdo∣men. The child was turned, he says, and extracted with considerable ease; <HI>en moins d'un miserere,</HI> as he expresses it himself. I cannot think, with Dr. Douglas, that La Motte's observations are related with such plainness and can∣dour, as to claim our most perfect con∣fidence. In this instance, we have a
<PB N="71" REF="69"/>case the most difficult that can possibly happen, and yet the delivery was per∣formed with the greatest ease imagi∣nable. I really am of opinion, that the relation is not founded in fact: I ap∣prehend that he has either magnified the proportion of the child which was out of the uterus, or that he has con∣cealed the difficulty he must have met with, in case such a considerable part of the child had been in the abdomen.</P>
<P>I have advanced some reasons, in a former part of these observations, when speaking of the head of the child being wedged in the pelvis, at the time when a laceration happens, tending to show that No. VI. was a laceration of the vagina.</P>
<P>We have a very defective account of No. VII. as from motives of delicacy to the gentleman who attended the pa∣tient, Dr. Douglas does not think him∣self at liberty to enter more particular∣ly into it.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="70"/>
<P>In No. VIII. from Peu, the time elap∣sed between the accident and the deli∣very is not related; but I am inclined to believe that it was done very soon after, from the apparent facility with which it was accomplished. There ap∣pears likewise some deficiency in the contractile power of the uterus, by the excessive hemorrhage that followed. We find however that he <Q>'delivered with great caution to avoid doing further in∣jury to the uterus.'</Q> This seems to inti∣mate some degree of resistance, altho' none is mentioned.</P>
<P>Dr. Douglas observes, that the great contractile power of the uterus is fa∣vourable to the process of healing, by bringing the divided parts more into contact; <Q>'but,' he says, 'the presence of any considerable extraneous sub∣stance, even in the abdomen, seems, in some degree to counteract this power of contraction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s case of ruptured uterus, p. 56.</NOTE>.'</Q> If the uterus after the expul∣sion
<PB N="73" REF="71"/>of its contents, does not con∣tract as in common parturition, we must expect a considerable flooding. In the above case, we are told that it was ex∣cessive. In the cases of Mrs. Wilkins, and the others which I have related as lacerations of the vagina, the hemorrhage was not very great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That a considerable hemorrhage will follow, however, from a laceration of the vagina, as well as from a rupture of the uterus, we have the authority of Veslingius. 'Bis enim notavi, cum uteri vagina, secundum latus dextrum esset disrupta, quamvis foetus extinctus integre cum secun∣dis educeretur; subsequente ex laceratis hypogastricis vasis enormi sanguinis profluvio, matrem paulo post fato pari∣ter cessisse.'—J. Veslingii observ. et epist. 45.</NOTE>, and the uterus was found contracted to the usual size it would have been, in the same space of time, if no extraneous body had been in the cavity of the abdomen.</P>
<P>In No. IX. from Steidele, it appears that the head had escaped from the rupture, he brought down the feet with ease, but found some difficulty in ex∣tracing
<PB N="74" REF="72"/>the rest of the foetus. This dif∣faculty must evidently have arisen from the stricture formed by the edges of the rupture round the child's neck; whence I think it cannot be considered as much support, to evince the ease with which delivery is performed, any more than the last case, where the patient expired while the accoucheur was endeavouring to bring the head through the pelvis.</P>
<P>LACERATIONS of the vagina, I have before observed, have been taken notice of by authors, yet it does not appear that they have had any idea of the child's escaping by such means into the cavity of the abdomen. If the case which gave rise to these observations, in which the nature of the accident could not be mistaken, and my reasoning on the dif∣ferent cases I have adduced, are allow∣ed
<PB N="75" REF="73"/>to have any weight, I think I may venture to draw the following conclu∣sions.</P>
<P>First, that the whole of the child es∣capes, into the cavity of the abdomen, much oftener from a laceration of the va∣gina than from a rupture of the uterus.</P>
<P>Secondly, That, from the little diffi∣culty with which delivery is accomplish∣ed in lacerations of the vagina, there is a greater prospect of recovery in such accidents, than when the uterus is the seat of the injury.</P>
<P>It is evident that the gloomy idea of inevitable death has not only been the means of checking such endeavours as might have been sometimes successful, but that it has likewise been often the means of preventing us from knowing the real nature of the injury. I hope practitioners in future will, from the for∣tunate event of the case of Mrs. Man∣ning,
<PB N="76" REF="74"/>related by Dr. Douglas, and the new light thrown on the subject by the case I have related of Mrs. Wilkins, entertain a more favourable opinion of the success likely to attend their endea∣vours, in a situation where nothing but immediate delivery can afford the least prospect of recovery.</P>
<P>When first I made my private remarks on Mrs. Wilkins's case, I did not intend to enter further into the subject, than to draw the case up sair, and send it to some periodical publication, as worthy the attention of the medical world. But the similarity between it and that of Mrs. Manning was so striking, that the more I considered it, the more reasons I saw to induce me to publish it in the pre∣sent form.</P>
<P>The nature of the subjct has obliged me to enter very fully into the merits of Dr. Douglas's case. That he should be liable to cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in forming an opinion
<PB N="77" REF="75"/>on the nature of the accident, is not to be wondered at, when we consider how silent authors have been upon it, and how seldom accidents of this nature oc∣cur. I have not the honour of being known to him; but I am confident, from the liberality of his sentiments as a gentleman, that he will not consider the liberty I have taken as personal, or in any other light than as a discharge of the duty every man in the profession owes to the world. It has a claim upon us to elucidate any occult part of the science, and every man is bound by the laws of humanity to comply with it, whenever an opportunity offers. Ex∣empla rara non reticenda, etiam causa incognita; ita enim scitu digna infinita praeteribuntur.</P>
