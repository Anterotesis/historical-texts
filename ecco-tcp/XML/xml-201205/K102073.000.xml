<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE writing of practical Observations is so ancient, and so universally approv'd among Physicians, that I need make no Apology for following that Method in those I now offer to the Publick. I shall only take Notice, that they come forth in the same Order as they stood in my own private Journal; and there∣fore, if they be mix'd with Incidents which are somewhat unusual in such Performances, yet, I hope they will not prove the less beneficial, as they are, in every Respect, calculated for the Relief of those Persons who date their <HI>Splenetick</HI> and <HI>Va∣pourish</HI> Disorders from the melancholy Circumstan∣ces of the Times, whereunto every good Physician ought to have a strict Regard, as the Impressions made by such Causes may sometimes require other Aids besides those of Physick.</P>
<P>But there are other Reasons which may justify my deviating somewhat out of the common Road in this Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> The many concurring Aggra∣vations which render'd those Maladies more than or∣dinarily obstinate. The Disasters which happen'd to Mens Pockets fell out, unluckily, about that Season of the Year, when above Two Thirds of the Nation
<PB REF="3"/>are naturally <HI>Splenetick,</HI> and when the Discon∣tented of all Denominations usually set their Plots and Machinations on foot. It is no wonder there∣fore, if the ordinary Methods can avail nothing, but that we are forced to have Recourse to all the Stratagems and Arguments our Wit and Reason can afford us.</P>
<P>This is all the Apology I thought necessary to make for what the Reader may find new or un∣common, and I shall take my Leave, by acquaint∣ing him, that I intend my Observations, for the two following Months, shall also be publish'd in a short Time, and will contain all the remaining Occur∣rences that were most remarkable in that Branch of my Practice, during the black and gloomy Season of the Year; and I doubt not, when my Labours are once finish'd, they will have the same Effect with the most efficacious Remedies, either to kill or cure.</P>

<HEAD>From the Feast of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> 1720. OBSERVATIONS ON THE <HI>Spleen</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HENRY FREEMAN,</HI> Esq; aged 42, and of a plethorick Habit of Body, was seiz'd with a Giddiness, and a Rising in his Throat, accompany'd with Faint∣ness, and many other Symptoms that at∣tend Hypochondriack Disorders. He told me, when I ask'd him how long he had been ill, that he had found the Distemper creeping on him for above a Month, but that he was every Day grown worse than another; that the Giddiness was but newly come upon him, and that he believ'd it was caus'd by a Cold he had got in <HI>Exchange-Ally</HI> the Day before, where he had waited an Opportunity to sell some Stock. He told me likewise, that he had got a Pain, or rather an Uneasiness in his Left Side near the short Ribs; and that he believ'd it was occasion'd by a Jew who came to beat down the Price of Stocks, carry∣ing a large Bag of Money, which, by reason of the Crowd, happen'd to be press'd several times against his Side; that he had ever since then been troubled with a Faintness; and in fine, that he was so bad, that he believ'd he could hardly live to another Day, unless I could find some speedy Relief for him. I soon perceiv'd by those Circumstances, that the Gen∣tleman
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>had been an Adventurer in the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and that all his Ailments had taken their Date from the Time the Stocks began to fall; yet, as I was unwil∣ling to dive particularly into his Affairs, I only told him, that I perceiv'd he had met with something late∣ly that had lain heavy upon him, which had been the Cause of all these Disorders. That the Giddiness, when accompany'd with a Rising in the Throat, al∣ways denoted Trouble of Mind, either from some external Cause, which is able to make too vio∣lent Impressions on our Imaginations, or from our own distemper'd Imaginations alone. That the Pain and Heaviness in his Side might also, with more Pro∣bability, proceed from the same universal Cause, than from any external Injury, as it was for the most part a concurring Symptom. I likewise took notice, that the Spirits were always seiz'd and much affected in those Disorders; because the Impressions were first made upon them. The Gentleman was fully persua∣ded that I had fallen rightly upon his Distemper, and began to tell me of his own accord, that he had been a considerable Loser of late, as he was one of the last Subscribers. He said, he always had a Diffidence in that great Project, and was even led into it in Com∣pliance with the Multitude, tho' it was against the plain Dictates of his own Mind. After which, he ask'd me if I thought his Disease would prove mortal; for he had never been in such a Condition before. I made Answer, that the Distemper seldom prov'd mor∣tal to any but those who gave themselves wholly up to it, and would by no means arm themselves against it; I therefore advis'd him to be chearful, and not to think too much of his Losses, and I would order what was proper, by way of Physick; and when I had pre∣scrib'd him a Vomit and some Pills, with a Bottle of Cephalic Drops, I left him.</P>
<P>Next Day I found him eas'd of the worst Symp∣toms, but the Heaviness and Pain of his Side was not
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>altogether abated, and the rising of his Throat con∣tinued; he seem'd also to be very melancholy; whereupon I ordered him a Liniment for his Side, and bid him continue in the Use of those Things I had already prescrib'd; but above all, to arm him∣self against the Disturbance of his Mind, which I perceiv'd at that Time to be great; but as he was naturally a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of Sense and Resolution, he soon got the better of his Distemper.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Arabella Blackham,</HI> aged 37, of a sanguin Complexion, but of a somewhat delicate Make, was suddenly seized with violent Fits; but before I could get to her Lodgings, they had left her, and she was faln asleep. I ask'd her Woman after what Manner she was taken, who made Answer, that her Lady had been in a very strange Condition, and had been very ill for a Month or longer, with hot Flushings in her Face, and had got several Cordials from the Apothecary, and was sometimes better and some∣times worse; but that something the Apothecary had said to her the Day before had lain so on her Mind, and had brought her into s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch Madness, that they were not able to hold her; but she tore every one that came near her, sometimes laughing, and sometimes cry∣ing, and was but just quieted. She said her Lady had never been well since the Fall of the Stocks, having put all Miss's Fortune into the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> with an Intention to marry her to Sir <HI>John Frisk</HI>'s eldest Son, who would have 20000 Pounds a Year at the Death of his Father, that she had borrowed Money on all her own Plate and Jewels, excepting one Salver and a Pair of Candlesticks; and that she believ'd her La∣dy design'd herself to marry a Gentleman that us'd to visit her, but that the Match was broke off within this Fortnight.</P>
<P>After so full an Account, I could not be at a loss how to judge of my Lady's Indisposition. I told the young Woman I would wait upon her Lady in the
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>Morning, because I was of Opinion she would pro∣bably rest all Night, after she had been so much fa∣tigu'd.</P>
<P>Next Day I call'd as soon as it was proper; but the Lady was somewhat frighten'd when she first saw me, and ask'd me if the Plague was come to <HI>London;</HI> begging, if I had been with any one that had it, not to come near her. I assur'd her, <HI>London</HI> was very free from the Plague, and that she needed not be under any Apprehensions. The reason of the Lady's Sur∣prize, as I came to know since, was from what the Apothecary had said to her. He is accounted a ve∣ry honest Man; but it seems, from a Desire the Lady should think him learned enough in his Profession, he told her she had some bad Signs, and would be apt to have the <HI>Furor Uterinus;</HI> this being a Disease she had never heard of, made her imagine it might be the new Distemper that now infests our neighbouring Kingdom.</P>
<P>After I had deliver'd the Lady out of all her Fears, I went and examin'd her Pulse, and found it very lan∣guid. She told me she was very full of Pain, and seem'd as if she had been beat with Cudgels. That, I said, was nothing but what was usual after all such violent Disorders, and that she would recover her Sore∣ness in a few Days. I order'd her some Pills with <HI>Asa foetida,</HI> and a <HI>Galbanum</HI> Plaister, as also an Hysterical Julep to drink after her Pills, or at any other Time when the Fits threaten'd. I order'd her likewise a volatile and cephalick Mixture, whereby the Lady is now altogether recover'd, excepting only that the Flushings sometimes return upon her.</P>
<P>Another Disorder of the same Kind happen'd al∣so at this Time to one <HI>Mary Duroy,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Thomas Duroy</HI> Mercer in the <HI>Strand.</HI> I found her ve∣ry much in the Vapours, and scarcely sensible; she told me little of her Indisposition, but said she was the unhappiest Woman in the World. That she had
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>a Husband, who kept all his Affairs to himself, and never would acquaint her with any Thing he did, but went on his own Way to ruin himself and his whole Family. But as I had no Business with the Concerns between Man and Wife, I turn'd to an elderly Woman who attended her as her Nurse, to learn what Condition her Mistress had been in. But the Nurse had, it seems, entred into Confederacy with her Mistress against Mr. <HI>Duroy;</HI> and to please her, had been exasperating his Faults, and, at the same Time, heightning her Mistress's Disorders. For instead of answering my Question, she took up the Story where the other had ended. We Women, says she, are now-a-days no more looked upon by the Men, than if we were Hobby-Horses. Look ye, Sir, my Master went a stock-jobbing, and us'd to get his hundred Pounds a Day; my Mistress, like a good Wife, kept in the Shop all the while, from Morn to Night, and charg'd him every Day to bring her home a Gold Watch, which was but a small Thing to his gettings. He told her one Week after another he would be worth 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year the next, and then she should have one of threescore Pounds; and till then, it was not becoming her to wear one; but God knows how he has jobb'd it at last, I am sure he has left my Mistress in a strange Condition, and never comes near her but on Sundays, and then he sits moping all Day without speaking to any Body; and if my Mistress asks him a Question, he tells her she's a Fool, and Women will always be meddling with what does not concern them. Here I put a Stop to the Nurse, who I found was but beginning her Nar∣ration, in order to know something of her Mistress's Disorders; bur they were both so full of their Indig∣nation against Mr. <HI>Duroy,</HI> that I could learn but lit∣tle from them.</P>
<P>The Hopes and Expectations of most Women are too violent to be baulk'd, and when they meet with
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>Disappointments, their soft delicate Natures are the least able to bear them; they never fail to occasion great Disorders, both in Body and Mind, let the Object be never so trifling. The chief Cause of Mrs. <HI>Duroy</HI>'s Sickness, by what I could gather, proceeded from the Want of the Gold Watch, a thing she had set her Heart very much upon, and perhaps had con∣ceived <HI>Ideas</HI> of insulting some of her Neighbours, who had got the start of her in other Respects. I found her Case to be much the same with that of Lady <HI>Arabella,</HI> and therefore put her under the same Method of Cure. The Accident which happened to that Lady, put me also upon a Stratagem which I managed, so as to be of Benefit to her, notwithstand∣ing it had like to have cost the other her Life. No∣thing contributes so much to wear off a settled Ima∣gination, as the giving Birth to some new Passion. I told her there was a very dangerous Sickness in Town, and tho' she was altogether free from any Symptoms of it, yet it behov'd her not to give Way to fretting, otherwise I could not promise what might follow. Upon this both she and her Nurse were qui∣eted, Mrs. <HI>Duroy</HI>'s Sorrow and Discontent was changed into a moderate Fear, which soon wore off, and now she is so well, as to attend her Husband's Business in his Absence.</P>
<P>This Week I was call'd to several other Women in the same Condition, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Wife of a Sales∣man in <HI>Long-lane,</HI> who had rail'd at her Husband for selling old Rags, when others were getting Estates in the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and setting up their Coaches. The Wife of <HI>John Tape,</HI> Haberdasher of Small-Wares, who, by the Losses her Husband had sustain'd in the Bubbles, was disappointed of a Diamond-Ring, a new white Damask Gown and Petticoat, and a large Silver Cup, which she intended against her next Lying∣in. But there is one Circumstance which ought not to be omitted, because it contributed very much to
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>the Aggravation of her Distemper, and that was her Husband's ill Usage. It seems she had been the Cause of his going into the Bubbles; and from the Time they sunk, he never ceas'd upbraiding her with her imagi∣nary Finery, until he made the poor Woman not on∣ly miscarry, but in that Weakness almost distracted. <HI>Martha Firkin,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Jonathan Firkin,</HI> Cheese∣monger, and <HI>Mary Pickle,</HI> the Wife of <HI>James Pickle,</HI> Salter, were also in a miserable Condition. I found both these good Women had persuaded their Husbands very earnestly not to meddle with the Stocks. But the one had promis'd his Wife a new Damask-Bed for the best Chamber, and an easy Chair of the same, with a Carpet for the Dining-Room; and the other had bought his Wife a Set of new China, with half a dozen new-fashion'd Spoons, a Silver Tea-Pot, and a Soop-Ladle; but the Misfortunes those Men had drawn upon themselves, had been the Cause of their Wives Disorders.</P>
<P>Most of these have succeeded very well under my Care; but there was a Number of others who are like to continue in a miserable Condition, whose Names I have omitted out of Tenderness, because I found them subject to an Infirmity which is not alto∣ther becoming their Sex; and that is, an unseasona∣ble and immoderate Use of spirituous Liquors. No∣thing is so destructive to hysterical Women as Drams; and yet, from a kind of craving Necessity, they are apt to have Recourse to them in their Languors and sinking Fits, which confirm them so into a Habit, that they return upon every Surprize, or upon the least slight Disorder.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 7. I was call'd to <HI>T'. M.</HI> Gent. aged 39. of a thin spare tallish Body, and of a pale Complexion. When I first enter'd the Room, I was somewhat sur∣priz'd; his Head was as large as a Porridge-pot; for he had got five or six Woollen Caps upon it, over all which was another lin'd with Fur; upon his Body
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>were several Flannel Wastcoats, a Cassock of thick Cloth, with a thick wadded Gown, and about his Shoulders the Quilt which he had taken from off the Bed. A Gentleman, who was sitting by him, seeing me look upon him with some Earnestness, burst out into a Fit of Laughter, which gave great Offence to my Patient, who, till then, was scarce able to speak. This unseasonable Mirth in his Friend put him into such a Disorder, that I soon perceiv'd what his In∣disposition was, and likewise that he had been some time a <HI>Valetudinarian.</HI> I advis'd him not to give way to Passion, telling him it would waste his Spirits, and then I took an Opportunity to ask him how long he had been ill. He was so much out of Breath, that it was some time before he could make me any Answer, but, as soon as he was able, he told me he had been bad about a fortnight; whereupon his Friend ventu∣red to put in another Word, and said, to his Know∣ledge, he had not been in perfect Health these seven Years. This exasperated my Patient to such a De∣gree, that he gave the other the Lie. Was not I, says he, as well as you, or any Man alive, for three or four Months together? did I not go every Day to <HI>Change,</HI> eat roast Beef, and drink Claret? nay we eat salt Beef, or roasted Pork, or any other Thing we could get. Now, Sir, I'll be judg'd by you, whether any Man that is not in perfect Health, could digest those Things. I made Answer, not very well. But as all this was little to the Purpose, I desired to know where the greatest of his Trouble lay at present; but the Gentleman had not yet put an End to his Discourse. Could any Man that has the least Indisposition, con∣tinued he, eat Beans and Bacon, Green Pease, Colli∣flowers, and Cabbages; any such Trash would at this time kill me in less than twelve Hours. I told him those Things were generally accounted windy, and for that Reason, prejudicial to Persons in those Circumstances I judg'd him to be in. Whereupon I
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>ask'd him if he was not sometimes troubled with Cholick Pains. Oh! always Sir, says he, never without them. Then I ask'd if he had not a Pain, or rather a Weight and Uneasiness on his left Side. At that Question his Colour chang'd, his Hands trem∣bled, and I perceived at the same Time a universal Disorder; But recovering a little, he went into the Closet, and brought out three or four Pots and Ba∣sons, one after another, in which he had made Water at several Times. I perceive, says he, you have the same Notion of my Distemper, that several others of your Profession have had; you fancy I have got the Spleen, and that all my Ailments are imaginary; but I'll assure you, Sir, you'll find your self mistaken. Don't you see there, how clear my Water is? there is not the least Sign of Concoction in it; I am told it prog∣nosticates a <HI>Delirium,</HI> and I expect every Minute when I shall be out of my Senses. Feel my Pulse, what a burning Fever I have upon me. Upon this I took hold of his Arm, and told him it was fitter for him to be in Bed than up; for it was then very late. But, says he, I cannot lie in Bed as those do, that love to indulge themselves; and for that Reason, most People think nothing ails me, but that I only fancy my self to be bad. I made Answer, that those Persons were much mistaken, that he was indeed very ill, tho' to the best of my Judgment, I could not say he was in Danger. I told him that I would visit him early next Morning; but as yet, it was not proper to prescribe any Thing for him, excepting only white Wine and Water, which I order'd him to drink.</P>
<P>This Gentleman has been a Valetudinarian from his Youth, which proceeded from a natural Indo∣lence, that ought to have been broke and overcome by Business; but as he had a sufficient Patrimony, he gave himself wholly up to Idleness, and would seldom go abroad, either upon his necessary Affairs, or for his Diversion; yet the natural Love and Indul∣gence
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>to his own Person, made him feed plentifully, tho' he had no Exercise or Imployment to digest it. This had laid the Foundation of his Distemper; by which Means, he became also unfit for any of the Offices of Life; for as he had, in a manner, sequester'd himself from the Society of Mankind, so nothing was more burdensom to him than Company; neither was this to be wondered at, for he was grown the Jest and Diversion of all his Acquaintance. And as the Mind soon takes Part in all such Indispositions, this solitary Person's Imaginations became exceedingly vi∣tiated, and his whole Thoughts were center'd upon his own Condition, which he now believes to be the most unhappy of any Man alive. The nobler Pas∣sions are quite extinguished and sunk, in the Excesses of Fear, Sorrow, and Anguish of Heart, which pre∣sent such dreadful Images before him, as cast a Gloom upon the whole Face of Nature, that no∣thing can relish with him: And albeit this Disposition of Mind makes him shun Company, yet the Appre∣hension of Death, or some sudden Disaster, works so powerfully upon him, that he can never be alone, but must always have some near Relation or old Ac∣quaintance with him, who is not a Stranger to his Condition, tho' even that Person, notwithstanding all his good Offices, must be a Slave to his Humours. His way of thinking is become different from that of all other Men, yet he judges himself so absolutely right in all his Apprehensions, that if his Friend contradicts him in any Thing, he believes it either in Derision of him, or out of Ignorance.</P>
<P>Thus much I learned of his Friend, who was also his near Relation, and had indeed judg'd accurately enough of his Cousin's Condition, which seems to be the more evident, from the extraordinary Alteration that happened to him, while he frequented the Alley, and was engaged in Business. The Disappointments he met with there, were the Occasion of his sudden
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>Relapse; but a Man in his Circumstances could never be happy, had ev'ry Thing he propos'd to himself answered to his Wishes; for as all his Labour tend∣ed only to a further Gratification of his indolent Hu∣mor, he must by degrees have fal'n back into his ac∣customed Disorders, only that a more plentiful For∣tune might, in Time, have increas'd his Maladies, instead of lessening them. Neither is this altogether improbable, from what his Friend further told me, concerning some Resolutions he had taken. He bought a piece of Ground, on which if his Affairs had succeeded, he design'd to have built a House, or rather a Castle, for the Walls were to have been four Foot thick, and under the Lining, they were to be laid over with Pitch and Bitumen, the Windows were all to be double glaz'd, and the inner Doors to draw up and down like Sashes. He said this was the ancient Way of Building, and Men liv'd then to a much greater Age, and more healthful than now, that the unwholsome Damps come through our thin Walls.</P>
<P>After hearing those things, I very reasonably de∣spair'd of doing Service to a Man who had given him∣self up wholly to his own deluded Imaginations. But according to my Promise, I waited on him next Morning, where his Friend was so kind as to meet me. It was broad Day when I came to the House, but the Windows were all shut as at Midnight, with a Candle burning on the Table. I ask'd if he was not almost stifled for want of Air: But this prov'd to be an unseasonable Question, for he was out of Humor with his Friend, who just before had been telling him how dangerous it would be to burn Candles Night and Day in his new House, where there was to be so much combustible Matter. This had put him into a very great Passion; but as soon as I came to know the Cause of it, I study'd to pacify him, telling him his Friend did that only out of good Hu∣mor,
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>to divert him in his Sickness, and that he ought to take it in good part. After this, I ask'd him how he had rested all Night; he told me very badly, but that the Apothecary had mistaken his Distem∣per, and that it was very strange no Body could find out what the Matter was with him; whereupon he went again into his Closet, and brought the Water which he had made in the Night. See you, Sir, says he, with abundance of Terror in his Looks, whether I be a Man for this World or not; Sir, you are a Physician, I know you are not afraid to dip your Fin∣ger into it, and taste it, you will find it as sweet as any Well-Water. I was somewhat surpriz'd at this odd Notion, and how it had come into his Head, for there was nothing in the Water but what was common to Hypochondriacal Persons, who, when their Disorders are much upon 'em, make large quan∣tities of Water, which is also very clear. But a Gentleman had sent his Servant that Morning, to en∣quire how he did, who came in about the Time he was taking a Survey of his Basons, and seeing a great Quantity of clear Water, took it to be the same Dis∣temper, the last Master he had serv'd, dy'd of, which he told him was a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> and that the Doctors us'd to taste it every Time they came to see him, and always said he would die, because there was no Salt in it. I us'd all the Arguments I could, to beat this Whim out of his Head, but to no purpose, it being but new; I ordered what was proper for him, and left him for two or three Days; but I found he could not be perswaded to make Use of my Prescrip∣tions, but was now about to call another Physician, only that the Apothecary prevented him, by sending him some Things he said were proper in a <HI>Diabetes.</HI></P>
<P>When I came again to visit him, I found him un∣der a fresh Disorder, for what he had taken had in∣deed put a Stop to the Discharges by Urine, but not the right Way; for he was now troubled with a vio∣lent
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>Defluxion, and he spit like one in a Salivation. Now, says he, I hope there needs be no further Doubt concerning my Distemper. You see, Sir, how fast I am going; he had kept two or three Pieces of hard discolour'd Flegm in a Gallipot, which he took to be some of his Lungs: But when we came to examine them, they were dissolv'd: Whereupon I told him, there was nothing here but Flegm; and that I hoped his Lungs were not so bad as he imagin'd. But all this would not satisfy him; for he fancied the Cat, or some Dog, had been in the Room, and had taken 'em out. I order'd that Night a Draught, and bid him be of good Cheer, telling him, that he was not in so imminent Danger as he apprehended. At this he was a little reviv'd, and ask'd me, if any Man could live after part of his Lungs were come up? O! yes, says I, never fear. I had order'd the Draught to be re∣peated the Night following; so that I did not see him for two Days more.</P>
<P>When I came the fourth Time, all things were much chang'd, and those Symptoms gone off. He was also very much metamorphos'd in his Apparel; for, instead of the Bed-Quilt, which he us'd to wear about his Shoulders, he was now cover'd with a Bear's Skin. His Friend was along with him, and seeing me look earnestly upon him, as I did at first, he could not again refrain from Laughter; and addressing himself to me, Had my Cousin, says he, been cloath'd in a Lion's Skin, as he is now in that of a Bear, you would undoubtedly have taken him for a second <HI>Hercules.</HI> But this was the Cause of fresh Heat in my Patient, who told his Friend, with a great deal of Passion, that tho' he was forc'd to wear a Bear's Skin out of Neces∣sity, yet it would become him much better, since he was as savage as the Creature to which it belong'd. But I interrupted the Dispute, and then ask'd the Gen∣tleman, how he did? He told me, he was something better, and that he had got this Skin to wear about
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>him, because he found the Quilt too heavy. When I was about to take my Leave of him, he told me with some Compliment, that I needed not give myself the Trouble to make him any more regular Visits; for he hop'd he was in a fair way to do well. Whereup∣on I parted, with a Congratulation for the promising Signs of his Recovery.</P>
<P>As soon as I was gone, the Gentleman's Friend fol∣low'd me to a Coffee-House I usually frequent, and gave me an Account of a new Prepossession had pleas'd his Cousin wonderfully; but that he was asham'd to mention it to me, because he had been so often mis∣taken. It seems, while the Spitting continu'd, the Thoughts of his Lungs coming up had frightened him to such a Degree, that notwithstanding he was grown a great deal better by the Things I had or∣der'd him, yet he sent for a Scrivener to make his Will. When the Scrivener came, they were under some Difficulty how to dispose of his Substance among his Friends; it being impossible to know what he was worth; for all he had was in the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> but he fell upon a Contrivance of his own, and told the Scrivener, he would have it made into so many Di∣vidends (for these are Words he had been much us'd to of late) he would give a third Part to one, a fourth to another, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Scrivener, who was not accustom'd to any thing out of the common Form, told him, all his Goods and Chattels, and every par∣ticular Sum, ought to be specify'd, otherwise it wou'd only occasion Law-Suits among his Relations, after he was dead. At that Word he started, and began to look pale; for he could never hear of Death without very great Disorders. A Neighbour, who was call'd up to attest the Will, and who, 'till now, could scarce∣ly believe him to be in good earnest, ask'd him, what his Sickness was? He made Answer, that he first had a <HI>Fever,</HI> and then a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> and was now fallen into a deep <HI>Consumption;</HI> and that he was, notwithstanding
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>all those Afflictions, tormented with an insupportable Pain in his Bowels. Upon this, his Neighbour told him, he knew a Man who was just in the same Con∣dition for a great while together, and had been in the Hands of a great many Doctors, but none of them could do him any Good, 'till at last he met with one who made him wear a Tyger's Skin, with the hairy side outmost, and in a few Days he voi∣ded a Worm Thirty six Yards and an Inch long, and has been as well since as any Man alive. This Story work'd so powerfully upon his Imagination, that he soon believ'd he had got such a Worm within him, and every Time his Guts growl'd, he fancy'd he felt it move. He sent all over the Town for a Tyger's Skin, but at that Time there was none to be had; but a Furrier, who came to know what it was for, and interpreting all this to be nothing but a Piece of Lunacy, and that the Worm was rather in his Head than his Belly, perswaded him that a Bear's Skin would do as well, and that he had sold several for the same Purpose.</P>
<P>This his Friend told me was the true Reason of his wearing the Bears Skin, and why he was now become so shy and indifferent about my further visit∣ing him, having from thence conceiv'd unquestiona∣ble Hopes of his doing well. And moreover, that he was in so constant an Expectation of his Delive∣rance, that he had provided a new Close-stool, with a Pan big enough to receive the Worm; and that all the Family was call'd together as often as he went to it, that they might be Witnesses thereof.</P>
<P>In this Condition I left him; but I have been since inform'd, that the Cure has not succeeded to his Li∣king, tho' he is still so much taken with the Fancy, that he has now apply'd himself to Mr. <HI>John Moor</HI> Apothecary in <HI>Abchurch-lane,</HI> in order to have some Doses of his Worm Powder.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Penelope</HI></P>
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Penelope Whitewash,</HI> a Maiden Lady, aged 38, was miserably afflicted with the Vapours. Another Physician had been employ'd before I was call'd to her; but she told me he had prescrib'd nothing but a Bottle of Drops to drink with her Tea, and that she believ'd he did not imagine how bad she was, for he came but seldom, and then made very light of her Indisposition. Upon this I desired to know where most of her Trouble lay. Indeed, Sir, says she, there are many Things trouble me, but that which lies heaviest upon me at present, is a continual Faintness; and the Apothecary tells me I have got a Fever up∣on my Spirits. I went to draw my Chair near e∣nough to take hold of her Wrist, in order to feel her Pulse. But this had like to have caus'd a very great Disturbance, for the Chair pinch'd the Foot of a little Dog, who had been some time scrambling about my Legs, but was now lain down under it to rest him. This put the Lady into a great Fright, and made her call out so loud, that her Spirits indeed suffered very much by it; but when she found the Dog was not hurt, she soon recovered, and told him he was very naughty to be always in Peoples Way, and bid him not go near the Gentleman's Chair any more: Then she address'd her self to me, and told me, the only thing that made her have a Concern for that Dog was, because he came of a Bitch which had been her Mother's; with that she fetch'd a deep Sigh, and began to be somewhat disorder'd, and ask'd a Gentle∣woman, who was by, for her Bottle, that she might smell to it. I bid the Lady be of good Courage, tel∣ling her, that I hop'd there was no Danger; and that I would order some Things would soon relieve her; and accordingly I prescrib'd her some Pills, with a Ce∣phalick Mixture, and then left her. When I was got down Stairs into the Entry, an elderly Gentlewo∣man met me, (who I understood to be the Landla∣dy) and ask'd what I thought of Madam. I told
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>her, she would, in all probability, do well again. Indeed, Sir, says the Gentlewoman, she frighten'd us all last Night; for she happen'd to see a Shrowd on the Candle, and I cannot tell what may be in it, but she believes ever since, that she is a dying; for she says, her Mother saw just such another but a little before her Death. I told her, there was nothing in that. It may be so, reply'd the old Gentlewoman, and I believe it is only a Cold she has got lately, when they were ma∣king all this stir about the <HI>Stock-Jobbers;</HI> for then she us'd to dress every Day, and go into the City; and I perceive she has never been to call well since. Ve∣ry probable, said I, and with that I went out of Doors.</P>
<P>Next Morning, I made the Lady another Visit. When I first enter'd the Room, the Lady told me, she was asham'd; for she was so bad that she could not put on clean Things, but was forc'd to be in that dirty pickle. Pray, Madam, said I, make no Apo∣logy; for we never expect to find sick Persons dress'd. She had got the Landlady's Daughter to keep her com∣pany, and an ordinary Woman, with a Pot of Coffee before 'em; which gave me an Opportunity to ob∣serve, that Coffee was generally look'd upon to be bad for Persons in her Circumstances. But the Lady made Answer, that she had not been drinking any of it herself, but had only provided it for Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> and that good Woman, who was so kind as to come now and then to divert her. I told her, nothing would do her more Service than chearful Company. Upon this, she ask'd me, if I lik'd Coffee? And whether I would be pleas'd to accept of a Dish? I very seldom com∣ply with my Patients in things of this kind; but be∣ing a cold raw Day, I drank one Dish, which the La∣dy pour'd out for me; and as soon as I had empty'd my Cup, and that they found I was unwilling to have it fill'd again, I observ'd the Landlady's Daughter take it up, and turn it round four or five several times,
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>looking earnestly into it all the while: But the good Woman frown'd, and knit her Brows at her, and wink'd to my Patient, while the other was so intent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her Observations, that she took no Notice, 'till at last she was pull'd by her Petticoat; whereupon she set down the Cup, and I perceiv'd she was at some Pains to smother a Laugh. By this time I had satis∣fy'd the Lady in all the Questions she had put to me concerning her Indisposition; and it being full time for me to be gone, I left her. When I was got to the other side of the Door, the young Woman fell a laugh∣ing aloud, and I over-heard her call to the Lady and the other Woman, to come and see what a large Pair of Horns there was in the Doctor's Cup. But as I am never offended at young's People's Mirth, I took no Notice, but went down Stairs into the Entry, where the Landlady was again come to meet me. She ask'd how I lik'd Madam to day? I told her, she seem'd to be a little more chearful; but that I was afraid she did herself Harm by drinking too much Coffee, tho' she was not willing to own it. But the Landlady con∣firm'd what the Lady had said, and told me, that Ma∣dam seldom drinks any herself; but this Morning, she had a Pot made for that Woman, whom she gave me to understand was a Fortune-Teller, and one who knew every thing by looking into the Coffee-Grounds. That, I said, was indeed a way of Divining I had never heard of before. Then I ask'd what she had told the Lady? Nay, answer'd the old Woman, I cannot say to you what may be in it; but she tells Madam, she always sees a Coach and Six in her Cup; and that she is sure the <HI>South-Sea</HI> will rise to 1500 by <HI>Candlemas</HI> next; and in a little time after, she will be married to a warm elderly Gentleman; and we believe it must be her Cou∣sin, who comes very often in the Afternoon to play at Cards with her; for he is just such a Gentleman as she describes. She tells my Girl too, that she is to be married to a fine proper young Man in a little
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>time, who will make her a very good Husband; that she will have several fine Children, and want for nothing that any Woman can desire; and abun∣dance of such Things, which, you know, pleases young People. Very true, said I, and so bid her a∣dieu.</P>
<P>This was the last Visit I made Mrs. <HI>White-wash;</HI> for I found she had received no small Benefit from the Fortune-teller's favourable Delusions, which, altho' they were practised with the most absurd and silly Device in the World, yet all were so artfully suited to the Lady's most earnest Desires and Inclinations, that they easily gain'd upon her Credulity, and will serve for a Season, to keep off that threatning Storm, which, in all probability, must fall so much the more heavy upon her, by how much her Expectations have been rais'd and exalted.</P>
<P>The following Week, which in my Account be∣gan the 15th of <HI>October,</HI> prov'd a Time of so much Business, that I never remember the like since I was able to practise; I had little or no Rest, but was sent for to all Quarters of the Town, and to many Persons of the best Rank; and every Time I came Home, I found my House throng'd with Peo∣ple of inferior Degree, some of whom had been deep∣ly engag'd in the Bubbles, but most were Tradesmen, who had sustain'd great Losses, by furnishing those with Equipages, who had not as yet been in any Decorum suitable to their new Acquisitions: A few of the latter were indeed so happy as to be engag'd in full Business, and had their Heads turn'd upon Me∣thods to retrieve their Losses, which had diverted their Minds, and kept off melancholy Thoughts; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t only came upon the Account of their Wives and Daughters, who had Time to think, and had there∣fore laid those Things more to Heart. The Hurry I was now brought into, confounded me to such a Degree, and the vast many miserable Objects I had
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>seen, dwelt so on my own Imagination, that I began to think the Distemper infectious; and for that Reason, I kept at Home one whole Day, and would not so much as suffer my Doors to be opened. But I was so much terrify'd at last, that I fell a trembling every time I heard any Body knock; and methought every Voice I heard in the Street nam'd Sir <HI>John Midriff.</HI> And just as I imagin'd, many of the Symptoms soon took hold of me, and no one can conceive the great Disorders I labour'd under for the Space of fourteen Hours. I began also to think of the Coffee-Cup, and was angry, and snapt at my Wife every Time she spoke to me. But after I had slept upon it, I sum∣mon'd all my Reason, and found my Body was per∣fectly well, and that my Disturbances were only ima∣ginary; I put on a Resolution not to give way to any such Prepossession, especially at a time when so ma∣ny Objects call'd for my Assistance; I therefore dress'd my self, and went abroad, as usual, to visit my Pa∣tients.</P>
<P>The first I made this Week was to an old Usurer, who had been no Proprietor in the Stocks; but had privately lent very near 12000 <HI>l.</HI> at 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI> In∣terest, and had himself paid at the Rate of 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for a good Part of that Money, which he was afraid would all be sunk, because both Debtors and Bondsmen were shipwreck'd, if not quite lost in the <HI>South Sea.</HI> But this Gentleman was really altogether incurable, for he had liv'd very abstemiously for a∣bove 20 Years; but, since his Losses, could not be pre∣vail'd on to take any Sustenance, excepting Bread and Water, for he was of Opinion he ought to fast for his Folly. After I had made him two or three Visits, and had acquainted him with the Hurry I was in, and that I was afraid I could not attend upon him any more, and when he found that I was just a going, he stop'd me, and putting on his Spectacles, he went to a Drawer, where I heard him chink over a
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>great many Pieces, and after I had waited his Time, which was a pretty good while, he brought me a Quarter-guinea, and press'd it into the Hollow of my Hand, bidding me carry it home to my Wife for a Purse-penny; and at the same time observ'd, that Gold was now-a-days become as rare as a Sallad at Christmas. From him I went to a middle ag'd Wi∣dow Lady, who was miserably in the Vapours, for she had sold the Life-Rent of her Jointure for a small Sum of Money, which she put out to be improv'd, in order to marry a lusty young Man, an Attorney, who was her Steward, and did all her Business. From that Lady I went to a Frenchman, who is an Artist, and had work'd above 20 Years in a Garret, during which Time he had liv'd for the most part on Roots and Herbs, and sometimes a little foetid Oyl for Sauce, whereby he had hoarded up some Money, but had lost it all in the Bubbles. When I came to him, I ask'd what was the Matter with him. Oh—de Matter, Sir, said he, I have got your D—md Anglise Maladie, that makes your Man and Woman hang demselves in de Room, and drown in de Water, and if I had been ane de An∣glisman I had certainly done my self so too, for I have lost all my Money and my Health. I could not but pity the poor Frenchman very much, for I understood he had been miserably bit by Men whose Birth and Station should have put them above such Practices, and therefore I advis'd him to apply to his Business again, and I visited him until he was pretty well, without taking any Fee of him.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Hazard</HI> Esq; was also one of those who usher'd in this Week's Practice. He is a noted Gamester, and has play'd away above two Thirds of a very handsome Estate, which was the Acquisition of an old griping Uncle. The Remainder he dispos'd of in the publick. This Gentleman, tho' he had gone through many Changes and Vicissitudes, yet he was never so sensibly touch'd as with his late Disappoint∣ments;
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>because he imagin'd himself arriv'd at that which he had been labouring for, early and late, ever since he was come to Man's Estate. I understood he had several grand Projects in view; but among others, had a particular Eye not only to some certain Men of Quality's Estates, but also to their Mistresses, which he thought was only but throwing a lucky Main or two as soon as he was able to enter the Lists with them. But although his Distemper was exceeding violent, and was also much heightned by Passion; yet it did not last long; for the next time I came to wait upon him, I found all things much alter'd; for he was whistling and singing, and practising by him∣self, and with a couragious Air rattling and striking the Dice-Box with great force upon the Table; and as soon as he saw me, he call'd out, What do you think of your Patient now, Sir <HI>John?</HI> I have rea∣son'd myself well by Philosophy; for I believe a Man of no Estate has as much Pleasure in winning two or three Yellow-Boys, as a rich Man when he casts up a Thousand Pounds; and I am of opinion, a Man may have as much Satisfaction in a neat clean Wench in a Callico-Gown and Petticoat, as with a Lord's Mistress, who has perhaps no more to set her off, than only that she is a Nobleman's Choice; and for that Reason, is kept fine, like a Lady, and at a Dis∣tance from the Vulgar. Upon this I could not but re∣flect in my own Mind, what Numbers of Persons were supported in their Folly by a vicious Application of Philosophical Maxims and Rules; but I made answer with a Smile, That I was not much acquainted with that Kind of Philosophy. This was answer'd with a loud Laugh from my Patient; and as soon as he had recover'd himself, that we had Time to exchange Com∣pliments, I took my Leave; for I found he was not susceptible of very lasting Impressions to hurt him, but was harden'd in the Ways of Iniquity, which were almost equal to him, whether in a higher or lower Capacity.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
<P>The next remarkable Patient was a famous <HI>Dissen∣ting Teacher,</HI> who had acquir'd a considerable Fortune, which had enabled him to become a no small Adven∣turer in the <HI>South-Sea.</HI> This had laid the Foundation of all his Illness; but there were other Circumstances that contributed to keep up his Disorders. When I had en∣quir'd into his Condition, and found him to be touch'd with the Spleen, I thought it might be no hard mat∣ter to do him service, as he seem'd to be a Man of some Sense and Learning; and therefore spoke my Sen∣timents freely, telling him, he ought not to mind his Disappointments, so as to give way to disorderly I∣maginations. But he made Answer, that these were at this time the least of his Care; tho' he could not but own, they had made some deep Impressions on him at first; but that now he found his Body very much distemper'd, and there must be some uncom∣mon Method taken for his Recovery, otherwise he would soon become one of the unhappiest Men alive. Those Expressions are so usual from Hypochondriack Persons, that I gave little ear to them, but persisted in my former Advice; and after I had order'd him some Cephalicks, I left him.</P>
<P>After this, I visited him several Days, but found him always harping on the same String, which made me somewhat more inquisitive than I had been before. He told me, he had sometimes a grievous Pain in his Head, sometimes in his Shoulders, and very often in his Shin Bones; and, indeed, Sir, said he, you will hardly imagine what a miserable Condition I am in. There was still none of those Symptoms but may at∣tend Hypochondriack Persons; and therefore I us'd several fresh Arguments to fortify him against his groundless Apprehensions; but when Men are once given up to the Delusions that attend this gloomy Distemper, they become so much enslav'd and over∣whelm'd with Fear, that every Idea presents some∣thing unto them that is dreadful; a great many new
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>Disasters are daily form'd, which have no real Foot∣ing but in their distemper'd Imaginations; and many old Afflictions, which had long been vanquish'd, are aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n revi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d with such a Train of Aggravations, that they render Life no better than a tormenting Dream.</P>
<P>This was now become the Case of our Parson, who had indeed got the better of those Impressions which had at first given Birth to his Disorders; but it was by others that were much more dreadful. He would often begin to disclose himself to me, but something always prevented him; his Colour often left him, his Hands shook, and I observ'd him to be under the grea∣test Disturbance imaginable. I must confess, it gave me some Uneasiness to see the Reverend Divine in all this Confusion; whereupon, I spoke to him with all pos∣sible Tenderness, intreating him not to be too reserv'd, but to tell me freely what it was troubled him so much. Sir, said he, you cannot probably have any Suspicion of what I am now going to acquaint you with; and if I was to give you all the Signs of my Distemper, they might indeed puzzle you; but you would hardly guess at it, as it is a Malady very unbecoming one of my Calling, nor any ways agreeable to the Reputa∣tion I have always had among Men. By these Expres∣sions I began to think he had, perhaps, been lately in Liquor, and had fallen into the Hands of some lewd Woman. Whereupon, I conjur'd him not to hide any thing from me; but if he had receiv'd any Injury from that Sex, to confess freely. The Ice being now broke, he shook his Head, and told me, it was a great deal worse than I could imagine; for the Distemper had lain in his Blood above Twenty Years. I got it, said he, when I was a young raw Student, and I am afraid, by what I find now, I have never been rightly cur'd of it. I ask'd him, why he had been so negligent not to have it cur'd all that while; and at the same time I observ'd to him, that he did not look like one who had lain under that Distemper. To this he said,
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>he had been as well as any Man till lately, but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow he was sure the latent Poison had begun to work, and was got into his Bones, which must no doubt be the Reason why he oftentimes felt so great Pain in them. But when I was going to undeceive him in this Particular, he put a Stop to me, and said, if the Distemper should break out upon him at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uncture, it was but a just Punishment for his Ava∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce; for before he put his Money into the <HI>South Sea,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was under various Scruples, and had many secret Conflicts, whether he ought to desire more than he had already; or, if that was allowable, whether he ought to follow the Example of worldly Men in be∣coming a Trader in the Publick, since he observ'd it had been the Cause of so much Atheism among us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd had drawn the Hearts of most Persons from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he true Object of their Adoration into downright <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dolatry; and therefore as he was sensible of his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rror in this Particular, and had even acted in some Measure against the Dictates of his better Know∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edge, he feared it was at last <HI>come home to him,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that perhaps he was visited with this dreadful Calamity, which otherwise might never have broke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut upon him. I made Answer, that he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed do better, than to make a religious Improve∣ment of all his Afflictions; but yet, I said the loss of his Money seem'd to be the real and most sensible Punishment he underwent at present, for in what re∣lated to his Person, I said I could not perceive any Thing amiss with him. But all this did not give him any great Satisfaction, for he was also under no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall Anxiety about his Wife, to think that she should suffer innocently on his Account. He told me she had likewise been very much troubled with the Head-ach of late, and had broke out all about her Mouth, and that she complain'd greatly of a sinking in her Spirits; but I found his Wife was only in the Vapours, as himself was in the Spleen, and there∣fore
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>I gave him to understand, that those Disorders were no other than what are common to most Wo∣men when any Thing troubles them. Upon this he paus'd a while, for he was sensible she had laid their late Disappointments pretty much to Heart; but there was one Circumstance that still terrify'd him more than all the rest, he had got two or three Pim∣ples on his Fore-head, which he imagin'd certainly to be the Effects of the Distemper; and I believe no grave Man before him ever consulted the Glass so much as he had done while he was under this Distur∣bance; for all the Time I was with him, he was con∣tinually pulling back his Wig to examine those Erup∣tions, and as often as he put his Hands upon them, he remain'd speechless for a Minute or two, and sometimes he also felt his Nose, lest any Thing should be amiss there. But at length assuming a little more Courage, he address'd himself to me in this Manner: I doubt, Sir, said he, tho' you are deser∣vedly reputed a very great Physician, you may, however, be unacquainted with my Case; for if I be not mistaken, I believe it is more in the Way of a Surgeon than in yours. I made Answer, that vene∣real Cases, if he meant those, were no less the Business of a Physician, than any other, and that Recourse was commonly had to some one of our Profession, when they prov'd too hard and difficult for the Sur∣geons to manage. Pray then, Sir, said he, pointing to his Fore-head, what do you think can be the Meaning of these Blotches? don't you believe there must be something more than <HI>ordinary</HI> in them? I told him they were nothing but what ev'ry one was subject to as well as he, upon catching Cold, or up∣on any slight Disorder; and I observ'd that the Di∣stemper could not conceal it self so long as he fancied, without making some Havock upon the Constitution, and therefore beg'd him to rest satisfy'd, and not tor∣ture himself with such Whims and Imaginations. But
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>to convince me they were no Whims, he took a Key out of his Pocket and opened a Drawer, where there were some Books with the Leaves folded in several Places, among which was <HI>Martin</HI>'s <HI>Treatise of the ve∣nereal Disease,</HI> where he shew'd me several Instances of Persons who had that Distemper lurking many Years in their Blood. But I told him it was a Loss to any one, and even to Men of Learning, to read Books of Physick, unless they had made that their particular Study, for they might very readily fall upon bad Authors, and even on scandalous Books that had been writ upon some Design, and that many a one had been so much terrify'd with the false or injudicious Instances in those Books, that altho' they were al∣together free from that Distemper, yet they could never be easy till they came into the Hands of those who would put them unnecessarily under the Grand Cure, and therefore I bid him rest satisfy'd, unless he had been lately transgressing. But at this he lifted up his Hands, and gave me to understand he had been married upwards of 20 Years, and assur'd me upon his Honour, that he never had any Thing to do with any Woman be∣sides his Wife all that Time. But Sir, says he, my Wife is a very likely Woman, and what can be the Reason I could never have a Child by her? I satisfy'd him that was no Rule, for there were many Instances of that kind, where neither the Man nor Woman were dis∣eased, tho' there might be some natural Defect, which most commonly lies in the Woman; and on the other Hand, that there were also many Instances of vene∣real Persons, who had begot Children even when the Infection had spread it self in the Blood. And do you think, said he, that my Wife may be safe, not∣withstanding all this, and that she can be in no Dan∣ger for the future? I made Answer there was no Manner of Danger; for I could discover nothing in his Case that could be the least injurious to her. This put so much new Life into the good Man, that he
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>was even like to leap out of his Skin, and in a Tran∣sport of Joy told me I was his Friend, his Father Confessor, and the rarest Man in the World, for deli∣vering him out of all his Fears, by such solid and convincing Arguments. After which he began to tell me of the melancholy and frightful Ideas he had lately fostered in his Breast, <HI>viz.</HI> what his own Con∣gregation, and all other sober Dissenters would have thought of him, what his Friends and Acquaintance among the Ministers, what a Wound it would have been to Religion, especially since his Life and Con∣versation had hitherto been unspotted as to the World. Had People once got a Notion of my having the foul Distemper, continued he, I should never have been able to look up any more; but now you give me so much Comfort, that I even despise all my late Disap∣pointments; and upon this he embraced me with the greatest Tokens of Friendship.</P>
<P>But as no Transport can continue long without some Change or Interruption, this venerable Per∣son's Joys were soon turn'd into a pannick Fear; for while he and I were in this pleasing Conference, we were unexpectedly surpriz'd by another Teacher who came to see him, and had drop'd in upon us before we were aware of him, who, seeing us engag'd, made a short Compliment, and went directly to the Table where the Books lay, and taking up one of them, be∣gan to read where my Patient had folded the Leaves. Any one may easily imagine what a dismal Condition the poor Parson was in at this new Accident; he looked like one that was ready to go into his Grave, and ev'ry Time the other cast his Eye off the Book to spit, or to take a Pinch of Snuff, he was like to sink into the Ground, lest he should ask him Questions; but my being there prevented that, and as I had been the Instrument of delivering him out of his first Fears, I manag'd the Matter in such Man∣ner as brought him safely off, and delivered him out
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>of the last too. When I rose to go away, I desir'd him to do me the Favour to give those Books house-room for an Hour or two, until I could send my Servant for them, which he promis'd very obliging∣ly; and so I left him in a fair Way of doing well.</P>
<P>I had many other Patients at this Time, besides this reverend Teacher, who had been consulting the Labours of Quacks and Mountebanks, and from thence tormenting themselves with the Imagination of Symptoms and Diseases they were altogether free from: Others were filled with the most monstrous Conceits that perhaps were ever heard of. But this I observ'd was a Relief to many, and the Flit∣ings of their Imaginations not only preserv'd them from desperate Practices, but help'd greatly to wear out the first Impressions, by changing them into o∣thers, which, as they were in themselves absurd and ridiculous, so they were the more easily vanquish'd and overcome. But it was quite otherwise with some, whose Expectations had been rais'd higher than to admit of any the least Disappointment. The sud∣den Stop that was put to their ambitious Desires, like an Eclipse, had so darken'd their Reason, that, to them, all Things put on quite different Appearances from what they were really in Nature, and the Ideas of Things were altogether chang'd from what they had been formerly, on their own Imaginations. All their Passions were swallowed up in Anger and Re∣venge, which in that total Darkness they were some∣times eager to practise upon themselves, from Want of Power and Ability to exercise it on others.</P>
<P>The following is an eminent Example of this kind, it being the Case of a Gentleman, who was a very considerable Adventurer in the <HI>South Sea,</HI> but had chiefly increased his Stock upon the Favour and Cre∣dit of others, and, from a Person of narrow Circum∣stances, was in a little Time advanced to a very sur∣prizing Fortune. But the higher the Precipice, the
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>more terrible and dangerous the Fall. This Gentle∣man had conceiv'd great Things from his new Ac∣quisitions; but upon his being baulk'd and disappoint∣ed, he was seiz'd with the worst Disorders that can happen to Mankind.</P>
<P>When I came to visit him, he look'd exceeding wild, and seem'd altogether out of his Senses, so that I found it in vain to ask him any Questions; for he seldom made Answer, and when he did, it was little to the purpose: But one, whom he had lately hir'd to be his <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> gave me the follow∣ing Account of his Condition. He inform'd me, when the Stocks were high, his Master us'd to be at <HI>Change</HI> all Day, in a perpetual Hurry of Business, and at Night he drank very hard, went late to Bed, and was up again betimes in the Morning, so that he took very little Rest, and was hardly cool for three Months together: He observ'd him to alter daily from what he was when he came first to live with him; for he was then a Man of a pretty even Temper; but lately, he said he was sometimes in such Passions there was no speaking to him, and at other times, he was so familiar and easy, that any one would have taken him to be the best natur'd Gentleman in the World. He told me he had bespoke an extraor∣dinary fine Coach, and a great deal of rich Furni∣ture, for which he was to pay a very high Price; some of these Goods were sent home to him, and for others he had laid down Money before-hand: he had also bought an Estate of 4000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, at 40 Years Purchase, to be paid upon drawing out his Money, which he intended against next <HI>Candlemass,</HI> and had laid himself under an Obligation of paying 10000 Pounds for Performance of his Contract. But his not being able to fulfil the half of his Engage∣ments, his Servant told me, had been the Cause of all his Disorders, which, he said, were become so great, that he was afraid to serve him any longer, for he
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>had several times attempted to lay violent Hands on himself.</P>
<P>I order'd him to be bled immediately, to be purg'd gently for several Days, and all that Time to make use of some Cephalicks, which I also prescrib'd for him. I charg'd them to keep him from all manner of Noise and Company, and when I had also given Directions concerning his Diet, I left him.</P>
<P>When I was got upon the Stairs, I heard a great Noise of Tongues in the Parlour, and above all the rest, a Woman's Voice, who seem'd to be in abun∣dance of Sorrow and Affliction: One of the Servants told me, she was his Mistress, who, he said, was so much engag'd, that she could not come up Stairs while I was with his Master. As I was going along the Entry, I over-heard one say to her, I could have depended on your Husband, Madam, for more than I am worth in the World; says another, Your Hus∣band has quite ruin'd and undone me; I never made the least doubt but he was worth 400000 <HI>l.</HI> a third call'd out, I will freely give you a Discharge in full, if you'll be so kind as to let me have my own Goods back again. As I went out of Doors, two Men that were leaning over the Pales, and look'd like Ruffians, started up; one of them made towards the Door; but the other call'd out, Back, (whom I perceiv'd to be a Bailiff) and as I cross'd the Way to a Hackney-Coach that waited for a Fare, I observ'd two Men more, with great Sticks in their Hands, and Hand∣kerchiefs about their Necks, start from behind a Cor∣ner, and were coming towards me; but another hem'd to them from an Ale-House that was hard by, which turn'd them back again.</P>
<P>When I was seated in the Coach, I desired the Coachman to drive to Sir <HI>Anthony Wheel</HI>'s, where I had a Call to go with all possible Expedition. After which, I began to be in a great deal of Concern for the miserable Condition of that Family, and of many o∣thers,
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>that had lately been plung'd into the like Circumstances, tho' at the same time, I could not but condemn the inconsiderate Rashness and Folly of some of those Persons, as having brought an innume∣rable Train of Evils upon themselves. Their Suffer∣ings were indeed great, but would not have been so, or perhaps none at all, had they not ty'd themselves in a thousand ridiculous Engagements, and, upon a false Presumption of being rich, run into many unne∣cessary Debts and Expences, which might have well been spar'd, till their Affairs were brought to a more certain Issue.</P>
<P>While I was busied in those Reflections, the Coach stop'd, but could not come near the Door, because of a great Crowd, who, hearing of Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Indis∣position, were gather'd about the House to know how he did. But most of those Persons had earnest Business with him, which made them so inquisitive about his Health.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> is a Man advanc'd to that Period of Life, which, <HI>Horace</HI> tells us, is rul'd by Gain and Am∣bition; he has been all along, 'till now, of a very healthful Constitution, which, no doubt, was owing to his way of Living; for he had been in constant Business of one kind or another from his Youth. He was taught betimes to read, write, and cast Ac∣compts; and upon his first setting out into the World, he was employ'd as a Secretary to many of his Neigh∣bours, who had not the Advantage of so liberal an Education; wherein he acquitted himself so well, that it was reported of him, no Man could fill up a Bond or Indenture with greater Ability: But his main Talent lay in Accompts; and altho' he never was instructed under any Tutor, further than some few Decimal Fractions, yet he became exceedingly enamour'd with Figures, as they were the Types and Representatives of that which he lov'd next to his Life. The Beauties that lay hid under those pretty
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>Devices were so great a Spur to his Industry, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould never give over varying their Positions, till he became more acquainted with the Powers of Num∣bers than any one before him, insomuch that he was the first who discover'd to the World how many Changes might be rung on Twelve Bells. He was also said to be the first who could practise <HI>Leger-du-Main</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Figures, and in this he even excell'd the most cele∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rated Artists; for most that those Persons could do, was only to bring Counters out of Peoples Pockets, and make them believe they were Money; But Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> could bring out real Sterling, and make them believe it to be only Counters, which he would in Time turn to Money.</P>
<P>These Accomplishments soon brought him into Fa∣vour with a noted Magician of great Power and Au∣thority, who always practis'd with a <HI>Lituus,</HI> such as the old Heathen Priests and Augurs were wont to di∣vine with; and to him became an humble Servant for several Years, during which Time, he had also great Opportunities put into his Hands of growing both Rich and Powerful, and indeed no one ever improv'd his Opportunities better; for in a little Time he a∣mass'd together such a Heap of Treasure, as has been seldom known in the Possession of any private Person; and at length he became to be of such Consideration, that the Eyes of all Men were upon him, and those who had not the Opportunity of conversing with him, studied as much as possible to follow his Example.</P>
<P>But this uncommon Regard, which the World paid him, at last prov'd his Bane; as it led him in∣to many Things that were ridiculous and extrava∣gant; for he was proud and ambitious by Nature, which he improv'd to such a Degree of Haughtiness, that he even made Princes and Nobles stoop before him; and if any Man truly had his Ear, it was his old Master or his Friends, who seldom came openly, but were always convey'd to him by some magical
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>Device, which rendered them invisible to others. His old Master was the only Person whom he ever admir'd for his great Abilities, but his Confidence in his own, at last very far overcame the Esteem he had formerly of his Master's Talents; insomuch that he has been known to laugh at him when his Back was turn'd, and to call him an ignorant Impostor; because he had oftentimes help'd him out by his Numbers, when the Heavens presented no favourable Omen. In fine, he became so presumptuous, that he thought he could do every Thing by his Calculations, and even at∣tempted to square the Circle; believing that extraor∣dinary Task had been reserv'd for him, because the Circle bore some Analogy to his own Name.</P>
<P>His ordinary Maxims were about Money, or the Relatives to it: He us'd to say, Money was the Sup∣port of Kings and Princes. That no Government could subsist without it. That it gave Power and Au∣thority to all Men, and was so precious a Jewel, that so the World was kept in Ignorance, as to the Means, it signify'd but little how a Man came by it. That Wit was but a Flash, and those Persons were general∣ly poor who had most of it, and that which Divines and Philosophers call Wisdom, was really Folly; for it was always accompany'd with such a scrupulous Preciseness, that it hindred Men from doing Justice to themselves. That Modesty, however admir'd by speculative Persons, was nevertheless unbecoming a Man, as it kept those, who were reputed so, always un∣der the Hatches; but that it was a Qualification well enough suited to Women. That all Learning, excep∣ting that which enabled a Man to look after his own Affairs, was no other than Madness; and serv'd only to make People troublesome to themselves and others.</P>
<P>It was impossible, that a Man of this Turn and Disposition should lie idle and unactive in our national Concerns, after the extraordinary Footing they were lately put upon. He therefore appear'd among the
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>first on the new Establishment, and became one of the greatest Adventurers, as he judg'd, nothing could be more likely to bring him to a full Gratification of his Wishes. But the sudden and unexpected Turn of those Affairs gave a deadly Blow to all his Ex∣pectations. Many of his Betters, who had some time ago stoop'd to his insulting Arrogance, were now no ways backward in censuring his Conduct, and most Peoples Thoughts were filled with Jealousy, that his Practices had not been so laudable as they ought to have been. His Abilities were also canvassed, and his laborious Calculations condemn'd as empty and chimerical. All which Afflictions coming together upon Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> brought him into a very bad State both in Body and Mind.</P>
<P>When I enter'd his Room, I observ'd it was very spacious, and every Thing in it as sumptuous as the rich Furniture describ'd in <HI>Dido</HI>'s Palace. He was himself seated in a Chair covered with Crimson Vel∣vet, fring'd with Gold, and over his Head was a Canopy of the same finely wrought. I could not well at first divine, whose Presence I was come into, and therefore I made him a more profound Obei∣sance than what is usually expected from one of my Profession and Years. As soon as he saw me, he ask'd my Business. I told him I had a Message that Morning from him, and was going to enquire into his Indisposition; when he interrupted me, saying he had so many came to him upon Business and Mes∣sages, that his Life was no better than that of a Por∣ter. Upon this he call'd his Servant to bid one of his Stewards come to him; whereupon an elderly Person soon entered the Room, whose Face I knew very well, and immediately I recollected, that I had seen him often upon the Exchange, and that he was a very noted Broker. He ask'd how much Stock he had sold that Day? but the old Man tip'd him the Wink, and then went and whispered him in the Ear,
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>yet so as I could overhear him. He told him there was no Market, and that the Buyers were all gone to the Devil, that now the Word signify'd nothing, for no body understood it. What, says he, not 1500 <HI>per Cent.</HI> against the Payment of the next Dividend? You may as well make People believe, reply'd the Man, that Stocks will rise to 15000. Every one cries out, <HI>Who buys?</HI> But no body offers to bid any Thing. This brought Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> into a very great Disorder, which was accompany'd with a boundless Fit of Pas∣sion. He snatch'd up an Ink-stand that was on the Table, and was going to throw it at his Steward's Head; but I step'd in between and prevented him; then he ask'd me who I was. What, says he, you are the Fellow that threaten'd to murder me the other Day, I'll have you secur'd this Minute. But I beg'd his Patience, and told him that I was a Physician; that I had practis'd in this City above five and twen∣ty Years, that my Name was <HI>Midriff,</HI> and that I was very well known to Persons of all Ranks, and that he could not himself be a Stranger to my Reputation in Physick; otherwise he would not have call'd me, when there were so many <HI>learned</HI> Persons of the same Profession to be had every where. What, said he, was it you that sent me the Dose of Poison the other Day? I told him, I had only been call'd the same Morning, but as yet had order'd nothing for him. By this Time the Servant came into the Room, who had been to fetch me, and went to confirm what I had said; but he was in so dreadful a Condition, that he could neither bear any one to be in his Presence, neither durst he be by himself; he snatch'd up the Stand again, and before I could do any Thing to pre∣vent him, he hit the Servant with it; for he was grown jealous of all Persons that were about him, and believ'd they had enter'd into a Confederacy a∣gainst him. When they were all gone, he looked stedfastly upon me; but being afraid to offer me any
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>Violence, and equally dreading to trust himself in my Company alone; he therefore fled out of the Room with a great deal of Precipitation, and shut himself up in another.</P>
<P>By all these Signs, I found Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s, Distemper border'd upon Lunacy, and that there was no ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k∣ing to him, his Imaginations were so wholly fix'd up∣on his Disappointments; tho' he could not really re∣collect within himself, at that Time, what they were, or how they had happen'd: He thought himself in∣jur'd and undone, but by whom, or in what Manner, it was impossible for him now to conceive, so great was his Disturbance: Nor is it altogether improba∣ble, but he might have a Conscience and Dread of his having injur'd others, who were ready to take their Revenge: And tho' this may not be real, yet such Impressions are often made or the Minds of lu∣natick Persons, merely from the common Fame of o∣thers, which, at last, settles into a firm Belief; and it, no doubt, proceeded from such extravagant Con∣ceits, that he look'd upon all Persons, without Dis∣tinction, to be his Enemies.</P>
<P>When I came down Stairs, I found several of his Stewards not a little dejected at the Misfortunes which had happen'd to their Master. One of them had been my Acquaintance many Years; and as I was willing to leave some Directions, I made towards him, and told him all that had happen'd to Sir <HI>Antho∣ny;</HI> and at the same time I desir'd some Care might be taken of him; that he should be immediately bled, to the Quantity of Ten Ounces, and that afterwards they should not suffer him to be by himself a Minute; for it might be hazardous, especially, if there were either Knives or Garters in the way. I told him likewise, how dangerous this Season was above all o∣ther Times of the Year; but that as the Weather was become more serene, he might probably grow better. But my Friend was very much startled at
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>these Sayings; for he could not imagine how a Man of so much Sense could be in such a Condition: What, says he, do yon look upon Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> to be mad? I answer'd, Not directly mad, tho' at the same Time, I could not judge his Case to be much different from that of a Lunatick at present. To this my Friend reply'd, That it was impossible, for he had for many Years been accounted a very long-headed Man, and had been able to go through Business that no Man could manage but himself, and that the ablest States∣men had always commended his Abilities. I said, that was not at all to be doubted of; for the Com∣mendations of Statesmen were seldom wanting to those who could serve a present Turn, tho' the Busi∣ness itself might neither be difficult, nor yet well∣managed in all Points: But that, I told him, was not very much to the purpose; for supposing him to be a Man of never so great Dexterity in Business, it could be no Argument why he should not be liable to the same Maladies as other Men. Then my Ac∣quaintance ask'd me, What I meant by taking care that there should be no Knives or Garters in the way? Do you believe, said he, that he is so melancholy as to make away with himself? All the Answer I made to this was, That People could never be too much upon their Guard, with respect to any one in such Circumstances: Upon this he left me with all the Haste imaginable to fasten the Windows; for the Thought came luckily into his Head, that unless they were so secur'd as Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> could not open 'em, he might, perhaps, leap out and break his Neck.</P>
<P>The Day following, I made him another Visit, and found him much alter'd for the better, after a Vein had been open'd. I was told he became excee∣ding thirsty, and drank above a Quart of white Moun∣tain, at several Times, mix'd with Water, which dos'd him to such a Degree, that at last he fell into a sound Sleep, which continued for the Space of nine
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>Hours. This had carried off the <HI>Delirium,</HI> so that he was now become pretty sensible; and as soon as I came into the Room, he began to make an Apology for his rude Treatment of me the Day before, which had been told him by the People that were about him. He said he had been in a very strange Condi∣tion; but it was so much like a confus'd Dream, that he could hardly remember any thing of it, excepting only, that he imagin'd there were a great many Peo∣ple gather'd about the House to kill him, most of whom were Persons of Distinction, and some, as he thought, were no less than Knights of the Garter; and moreover he believ'd firmly, that his own Ser∣vants were in League with them, and had engag'd to deliver him up. I observ'd to him, that such Ima∣ginations were very usual to Persons in his Circum∣stances, and that it was a Sign his Mind had been ex∣ceedingly shaken, but that he must endeavour to learn a little more Fortitude, this being a Juncture which required him to exert all the noble Qualities he was Master of. At this he made me a Bow with his Head, and, with an obliging Air, he also thank'd me for the good Opinion I had of him. I was a little surpriz'd at first what his Meaning was, and began to fear a Relapse; but I soon found he was only un∣der a Mistake, and had apply'd the Epithet <HI>Noble</HI> o∣therwise than I intended it. But as I never love to flatter my Patients to their own Prejudice, I ventur'd to put him in the right in this Particular. I observ'd, that we had all of us noble Qualities implanted in us by Nature, tho' the far greater Number employ'd them to dishonourable and ignoble Purposes; and I doubt not, but a Person, such as he was, who had gone thro' so many different Scenes of Lise, and had been so much conversant among Men, must be very sensible of this in the Practice of the World. And I was going to observe how useful and noble a Qua∣lity Fortitude was, and what Virtues were required
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>in us before we could arrive to any tolerable degree of it; but he interrupted me, and said, those Things were indeed very fine to talk of; tho', as to his own Part, he never troubled himself with Mens good or e∣vil Qualities, any further than to take care they should not hurt him with them if possible. Then he ask'd me if I could order him any Thing that could do him good, for he found himself mighty subject to a Trembling, and was apt to start and be surpriz'd at every Thing. I told him, all that Physick could do in that Case signified but little, for his Distemper was really more in his Mind than Body; that his Body indeed suffered, but that was only secondari∣ly, and if his Mind could be brought into a right Composure, the other would soon be freed from its present Indisposition.</P>
<P>Tho' he all this while had answer'd as rational∣ly as was usual to him at other Times, yet I ob∣served a very great Disturbance in his Looks by Inter∣vals, and he was ready, upon every slight occasion, to fall into unreasonable Passions with his Servants; whereupon I advis'd him not to suffer every little Offence to discompose him, for that would be the ready means to aggravate his Disorders, whereas a contrary Habit would help greatly to lessen them. But while I was expostulating with him in this man∣ner, we were suddenly alarm'd with a Noise in the Street, which brought him into a fresh <HI>Deli∣rium;</HI> it was nothing but the Mob was gathered about a Pick-Pocket, whom the Officers were carry∣ing before a Magistrate; but when Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> heard their Tongues very loud, as is usual upon such Oc∣casions, he star'd and began to look exceeding wild, and all of a sudden leaping from his Chair, he went to hide himself. It was with much difficulty we could beat this new Prepossession out of his Head, because the Impressions were made very deep but the Day before. He believ'd his Adversaries had
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>now laid close Siege to the House, and he often cal∣led out with a bellowing Voice to see that all the Doors were secured; but when he found there was nothing real in all this, he seated himself again in his Chair, and turn'd very dumpish, which is the usual Result of Fear, Anger and Despair, which, as has been observ'd, ordinarily bear the ascendant in all such melancholy Dispositions.</P>
<P>After this, I call'd upon him several Days successive∣ly, and prescrib'd what I judg'd proper by way of Physick; but I was more particularly solicitous in what concern'd his Diet, and as he was a Man of a some∣what plethorick Habit of Body, and lately become more than ordinarily addicted to Passion, I look'd upon Abstemiousness to be the likeliest Means to bring that under, and therefore I order'd him such Food as was of easy Digestion, and at the same time afforded but moderate Nourishment: This Me∣thod was attended with so much Success, that he mended so far as to go abroad, for his Affairs were urgent, and very much required his Presence.</P>
<P>But it is next to an Impossibility to effectuate a perfect Cure on any one in Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Circumstances, for he is really but a Man of a weak Mind and little Knowledge. He had indeed, like many other super∣ficial Persons, gain'd a very great Reputation among Men, yet that was only taken from outward Shew and Appearance, and not from any Virtue or Abili∣ty, wherein he had excelled others; but as he had al∣ways been in constant Employment, his Mind was wholly taken off from many of those lesser Concerns which the more numerous part of Mankind are of∣ten engag'd in. This had created a Severity in his Looks, which was accompanied with an Air and Semblance of Wisdom, sufficient to impose on all who had not a perfect Intimacy and Acquaintance with him. But it appears, now the Mask is taken off, that he is no other than a meer Pedant in Business,
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>and one who, like the blind Horse in a Mill, went as sure and as steady as the most quick sighted could have done, so long as he kept plodding and drudging in his usual Round of Affairs; for then all was with∣in the compass of his Understanding. But when Pride, Avarice, and Ambition (the constant Com∣panions of our first-rate Fools) had once carried him beyond that Circle, he was soon bewilder'd in a Maze of Difficulties, while his perplex'd Mind was no ways season'd with those Virtues that were ne∣cessary to extricate and set him at Liberty.</P>
<P>The last Time I went to him, I found his Condi∣tion still altered, tho' I cannot say it was a great deal for the better. He was not indeed so much afraid of Assassinations and Conspiracies as he had been be∣fore, and I perceiv'd he was not so easily alarumd at Noises in the Street; but I found a new Calamity had taken hold of him, and tho' it did not seem di∣rectly to point at his Life, yet it touch'd that which was as dear to him, <HI>viz.</HI> his Money and his Repu∣tation. He told me he was grown worse and worse, and that he hop'd some People would be quiet when they had made an end of him. Upon this I went to feel his Pulse, for he had a pretty high Colour in his Face, which made me believe he was feverish, or else that he had been drinking. When I was coming towards him, he started, looked me broad in the Face, and ask'd me hastily, what I was going to do. I told him I intended nothing that would hurt him, and with that I took hold of his Wrist. I found him a little feverish, which I judge might be occasion'd by the great disturbance of his Thoughts, which had kept him from Sleep. After which, I ask'd him who those were he was now so much afraid of? He answered, they were Persons of some Note, whom he had once in his Life-time obliged very much, but he found they had neither Honour nor Gratitude in them. They envy'd the little Acquisitions he had
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>made, and could never be satisfied, unless a Man wou'd give up all he had ever toil'd and labour'd for. He said they had suborn'd false Witness to swear against him, that he had us'd many ill Practices, and been a bad Example to others; and that they might put him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s great Expence, and bring him under as much Ig∣nominy and Disgrace as possible, they would oblige him to build a Scaffold in <HI>Westminster-hall</HI> for his own Tryal. Well, answer'd I, what have you further to say? To say, reply'd Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> a great deal. Those very Men and I were exceeding friendly but a little while ago; they complimented me, and I did Favours for them, and many of their Friends too; they often told me what a useful Subject I was, and how great a share I had in his Majesty's Favour; and that they never omitted to speak a good Word for me as often as they had an Opportunity. But now, said he, I know by their Looks they have a mind to ruin me, and some of them even use oblique Threatnings to my Face. I began by this time to believe that Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> gave Credit to his own Dreams, and indeed I could hardly forbear being out of Humour, to hear him talk at this extravagant Rate. I therefore de∣sired him to compose himself, and not suffer such idle Fancies to run in his Head, for there was nothing at all in them. In them, said he, don't you hear it talk'd in all Places wherever you come? I was not a Stranger to the Rumours that were spread about the Town concerning Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Conduct; but I thought it not proper to make him a direct Answer. I ob∣serv'd to him, that we were all of us liable to Mis∣carriages as often as we presum'd rashly to go out of our limited Bounds. That we were naturally apt to do this, from an over-fond Conceit and Opinion of our own Merits and Abilities. That we long'd to be at those things which were placed at the greatest distance from us, and, like <HI>Icharus,</HI> we often plung'd ourselves into an Ocean of Troubles, while we at∣tempted
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>to fly up to the Sun with Wings of our own making. I took notice, that many of us were too forward to fix our Hopes on an imaginary Good, and from a too eager Desire after it, made use of indirect Means to obtain it. This, I said, might undoubtedly be the reason why such Persons, when their Expecta∣tions fail them, were commonly tossed about with the Imagination of Evils, which had their Being no where so much as in the Mind. But Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> took all this as apply'd to himself, and with a Smile, which at the same time carried an Air of Dissatisfac∣tion and Contempt, ask'd me what he had ever aspi∣red after that was imaginary. I know, said he, you Philosophers often account those Things imaginary, that other People find to be real; you reckon Mo∣ney an imaginary Good, but shew me what you or any Man can do without it. Honour and Greatness, I know, are also classed in the same Rank, according to your precise way of thinking, but let me see the Man will refuse either when offer'd to him. I made answer, that there was, no doubt, a real Good in all those Things, when they were put to their right and proper Use, and that Peoples Desires were moderate in them, and their Designs truly honourable: And I was going on, to tell him what it was that, in my Judgment, render'd them evil. But he interrupted me, and said, he did not see but every Body was for getting all they could, and what Reason was there that he should be behind hand, since he had perhaps deserv'd like other Men; but especially the World be∣ing come to that pass, that those Persons were only trampled upon, or set light by, who were not in some Degree of Power or Authority. I could not but own what he had observ'd was oftentimes too true, if meant with respect to Men in narrow Circum∣stances, and inferior Station. But yet I said that was no Argument, why such as wanted nothing, and were even got above the Insults of the World, should aspire
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>further, unless it was purely, that they might be able to do the more Good. If after this, they were prompted by any other Motives to advance their Station, than what proceeded from a truly publick Spirit, I observ'd that they were most commonly bad ones. I said, moreover, that no Man could be real∣ly happy, in the Enjoyment of his Acquisitions, ei∣ther of Riches, or from any outward Marks of Di∣stinction confer'd upon him, without those Requisites, that bear the true Stamp of Nobility; <HI>viz.</HI> a Con∣sciousness of noble and virtuous Actions; and where∣ever that Testimony was wanting in an exalted Con∣dition, I said, it was generally attended with a great deal of Uneasiness. I concluded, that Titles were, at best, esteem'd but meer Pageantry, when they were not supported with true Generosity; and, whatever a vain Person in undeserved Honours might think of himself, he was in the Eyes of all wise Men accoun∣ted no better than a Figure of Wax, robed in Purple, or a prophane Image set up to be worship'd, tho' it has not the least Shadow or Appearance of a Deity.</P>
<P>I could not avoid expostulating with Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> in this Manner, and likewise bestowing on him some grave Admonitions; because I found his Heart whol∣ly set upon Nobility, an Honour whereunto he had no just Title, nor indeed any Likelihood of enjoying it. Yet all my Arguments could not avail so as to bring him to any Sense of his Folly; for he was too far gone in that Delirium to brook the Disappoint∣ment: He had, not long ago, so strong a Presumption of being made a Peer; and his Mind was so highly transported with the Hopes of it, that he had drawn up the Form of a Preamble, such as he, no doubt, flatter'd himself would be made on the Entry to his own Patent. This I accidentally observ'd to lie o∣pen upon his Table, among some other Papers; for I was so near that I could peruse some part of it; but looking upon it to be no less hurtful while in his Sight, than Wine to a Man who is already drunk; I
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>therefore, as the best Office I could do him, waited an Opportunity to deprive him of that Idol; and ve∣ry luckily, when his Face was turn'd from me, I took it up, and put it in my Pocket unobserv'd, and have now committed it to the publick, with the same marginal Notes that were upon it; because it will give the curious Reader some further Insight into his Condition. It is as follows:</P>
<P>If a noble and ancient Pedigree has always been accounted a great Advance in the Way to Honour and Nobility, our<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">When I come to be a Peer, all publick Writings from the King's Majesty will run, <HI>To our trusty and well-beloved Cousin and Counsellour.</HI></NOTE> trusty and well-beloved <HI>Anthony Wheel,</HI> Knt. must, in that respect, be sufficient∣ly recommended to us, as he is a Person of no mean or ignoble Ex∣traction, but sprung from the an∣cient Race of the <HI>Wheels;</HI> a Family, which tho' it has for many Ages past strove with the Iniquities of For∣tune, yet, by its frequent Alliances with those of the best Blood, derives a no small Honour on all its wor∣thy Descendants.—And if we also put a Value on the Goods of Fortune, as these are the Means to en∣able Persons in the highest Stations, as well to support their great Dignity, as to render them the more con∣spicuous Patrons of their Country, he must no less de∣serve our high Regard on that Account, having by his own proper Merit arriv'd at such large Acquisi∣tions, as may vie with the greatest of our Peers; and therefore may well become the Representative of such worthy Ancestors, whose almost extinguish'd Fame is again happily reviv'd in him; and the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Memorandum,</HI> To look into <HI>Baker</HI>'s Chronicle, or some other good History, to know what Services the <HI>Wheels</HI> have done to their Country.</NOTE> Name of <HI>Wheel,</HI> by his un∣wearied Diligence, become once more of no small Account in these our ancient Dominions.—But if a continued Series of great and laudable Actions can be sufficient to derive Titles of Honour and Nobility on those who have travell'd
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>long, and pass'd through the best Stages of their Lives in the Service of their native Country, the said Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> must undoubtedly claim a just Title to those distinguishing Marks of our Royal Favour, he having not only given us many signal Proofs of his uncommon Abilities in divers considerable and weighty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I am afraid I can∣not have this Charac∣ter, unless I be put in∣to some pretty hand∣some Post for a little while.</NOTE> Employments, but by his strict Fidelity, assiduous Care, and indefatigable Industry, render'd him∣self most dear unto us, and most de∣servedly esteem'd by all our good and faithful Subjects. And if those Persons are highly to be accounted of, who in all Times of Danger be∣come notable Instruments in Defence of their Coun∣try, tho' to the utmost Hazard of their Lives; and, if besides the Glory they thereby purchase to them∣selves, ought also to receive all due Honour from us, as a further Reward of their Valour and noble At∣chievements; so we ought by no means to pass by unregarded the extraordinary Merit of such of our good and Loyal Subjects, who being Masters of very large and uncommon Possessions, are no less ready to venture them in a Time of need. This truly publick Spirit has most manifestly shewn it self, in many ex∣traordinary and singular Instances of Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Life; but more especially by his hearty Zeal and Readiness to redeem the Debts of the Nation, having, like a true-hearted <HI>Briton,</HI> set a notable and great Pat∣tern to many others of our wealthy Subjects, by whose joint Endeavours, the great Burden, which by a long and necessary War lies so heavy upon us, is now like to be soon lessened, and our good Subjects eased of many sore and grievous Taxes, which are very oppressive upon them.—But if we also regard the said Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> with respect to many other Qualifications and Endowments, which recommend those who are advanced unto the highest Honours, the Portliness of his Person, and stately Behaviour, ought not to be overlooked. We commend some for
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>their Politeness, some for their Affability, and others for their courtly Deportment. But Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> is a Person, whose noble and stately Carriage bespeaks the real Greatness of his Mind; he knowing full well at all times, how to keep up that Awe and Reve∣rence, which is so highly becoming an exalted Sta∣tion. For these and many other publick and private Virtues, so manifest in Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> besides his known Loyalty to our Royal Person and Family, (ever since our Accession to the Throne) we have thought fit to call him to the Dignity of a Peer of our Realm, by the Name and Title of <HI>Antho∣ny Lord Wheel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The same Title will answer very well to Earl, or Duke; for <HI>Wheelburrow</HI> sounds like <HI>Marlburrow.</HI></NOTE> Baron of <HI>Wheel∣burrow.</HI> And we do hereby, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I was told, Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> had also intoxicated his Brains with many other Things; such as usually tickle the Fancies of vain and presumptuous Persons, and altho' he was as great a Lover of Money as any Man could well be, yet no one was more lavish when it tended to the Gratification of his vain and ambitious Desires; but among many others, I shall only name this one In∣stance, which I had from my old Acquaintance; and that was concerning his Picture, which was to be drawn at full Length, with the Frame all of pure Sil∣ver finely gilt; for this he had agreed to pay a very extraordinary Sum, but it was put off for a Time, and very probably until he was made a Peer, that he might be painted in his Robes.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 22. I was call'd to <HI>Robert Pitfal</HI> Esq. a coun∣try Gentleman, who had faln sick at an Inn. He was a Man near forty, and of a seemingly robust Constitution, and of a hail Country Complexion, so that I could not perceive any great Symptoms of Sickness, excepting only, that I found his Pulse some∣what disorderly: I therefore ask'd him very particu∣larly, how he found himself, and what it was he com∣plain'd
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>of most. He told me he had got a new Dis∣temper he never had heard of before; and when I ask'd him what that was, he said, ev'ry Body told him he had got the Hyppo, and that they said, it was a plaguy whimsical Disease, that made People be∣lieve and fancy Things, and that he could not ima∣gine what it could be; unless it was the same, that a Parson had, of a neighbouring Parish to that where he liv'd, who us'd to fancy he had a clucking Hen in his Head, and set all the Country a laughing at him. Upon this, I told him, that I hop'd he had no such Imaginations as those. Not I, reply'd the Gentleman, but the other Night I could not lie in Bed, but was forced to get up again, and had a Fire made in my Room; and in the Morning, when I told my Land∣lady how I had been, she laught at me, and said, I had only got the Hyppo; and if I would keep my own Counsel, no body would know I ail'd any Thing, because I look so well. But to tell you freely, says he, I believe you are half poison'd in this Town with unwholesome Food; and I am sure I have eat some∣thing my self that cannot digest, but lies like a hea∣vy Lump of Lead in my Stomach, which oftentimes swells up in my Throat like to choak me; but espe∣cially when I lay my Head down upon the Pillow: And I believe, continued he, there is something in your Drink too, that should not be in it, which makes it more than ordinarily diuretick, for I make a woun∣dy deal of Water lately. By these Expressions I found he was indeed touched with the <HI>Hyppo;</HI> and because I observ'd him to be one who had been us'd to eat and drink plentifully, and wanted his usual Exercise to digest it; and being of a full gross Habit of Body, and as he complain'd likewise of a Swimming and Gid∣diness in his Head; I was therefore of Opinion, he might be very apt to fall into a Fit or the Apoplexy; to prevent which, I order'd him to be let Blood in the sir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Place, and after that to be vomited; I order'd
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>him likewise some Cephalicks. But when I had got Pen, Ink and Paper, and was just going to write, he call'd out with a great deal of vehemence to prevent me, and swore heartily, he would have no more Bills and Notes, for he had lately parted with above the half of his Estate, and had got nothing but Paper for it. But when I told him I was only going to give some Directions to the Apothecary, that he might make up what was proper for his Distemper, he ask'd my Pardon, and said he hop'd I would not take it amiss; for the very Sight of Scraps of Paper put him almost out of his Senses. By this, I also came to know what had been the Cause of his Distemper, <HI>viz.</HI> that he had, like the rest of my Patients, been pretty deeply en∣gag'd in the Stocks, and that Things had not succeed∣ed there to his Wishes. When I was going, I de∣sired he might be carefull to mind my Directions, which the Apothecary would acquaint him with, and that I doubted not, but I shou'd find him better in a short Time.</P>
<P>When I came the next Day, he look'd somewhat out of Humour, and before I could ask him any Questions, he began to complain, saying, I had al∣most kill'd him with the Vomit, that it had made him as sick as a Horse, and that he had never been in such a Condition since he was born, excepting once after a fit of hard drinking with some Gentle∣men at a Horse-race, where they drunk little or no∣thing but a very strong kind of Punch, which was made with Brandy and Whitewine without Water. By this I find, that Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> had never been much us'd to Physick, for he also ask'd me what was the Bot∣tle I had sent him, and whether I had not put <HI>Scar∣burrow</HI> Water in it, for he said it tasted like Mares Piss. I answered, that there were some Volatile Salts in it, which had not indeed a Taste that suited every ones Palate; but at the same time I observed to him, that these were very proper to remove that
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>Disorder of his Head he had so much complain'd of, and that they would certainly be of Service to him, provided he would be so far his own Friend as to continue in the Use of them. To this he reply'd, that he believ'd they had done him some good already, for he had slept better that Night than he had done for a Week before, and he thought his Head was not altogether so cloudy as it had been, and for that rea∣son he said he should very willingly take the Stuff in the Bottle, or any thing else I thought proper for him, if it would not set him a vomiting again. I told him I could not well avoid ordering him a Vo∣mit in the Beginning, as it was necessary to lay the Foundation of his Cure, but that I hop'd there would be no occasion to repeat it. After this, I ad∣vis'd him to go abroad and divert himself, and as he had Horses at command, and had always been us'd to Riding and Country Exercise, I said it wou'd be of no small Service to him if he rid out once a Day into the open Air, especially, since he had ta∣ken up his Lodgings in so close a Place, and where there was so much Dung and Litter. But he made answer, that he lik'd the Smell of Horse-dung better than some of our finest Gardens about <HI>London,</HI> and that he believ'd it would do him no Hurt, for he had heard several learned Men say, that nothing was more wholesome than the Smell of a Muck-hill. He said he had lain one Night at Sir <HI>Thomas Courtley</HI>'s, who, he told me, was his first Cousin, but could not rest for the Noise of People thumping at the Doors, and calling out continually in the Street; And besides, he observ'd, that altho' Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> was indeed very civil, yet he did not much like to be at his House, for he found he was always out of Humour when any Body wanted him, and us'd to chide his Servants for saying he was at Home. He said, that a Man had as good be continually at Church as at Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s, for no Body in the House spoke but as if they were whis∣pering
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>something that should not be heard; and when they were at Table, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> directed most of his Discourse to some body else, which oblig'd him to sit as silent as a Stock. He added likewise, that Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> commonly went away as soon as Dinner was over, when it was the proper time to drink a Glass and smoak a Pipe; that he us'd to take his Leave very civilly, and desired him to stay and divert him∣self with his Wife and Daughters, who never enter∣tain'd him with any thing but Tea, and that the young Husseys us'd to fill him brimmers, which he believ'd was only that he might scald his Fingers, on purpose to laugh at him when he was gone; and for these Reasons he lov'd to be at an Inn, where he paid for what he had, and could therefore use his Freedom: Besides, that he always lik'd to be near his Horses, for he said the People in this Town were not to be trusted. I could not indeed forbear giving my Assent to what Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> had said, because I found Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> and he was of a quite different Turn and E∣ducation, for an Inn is no doubt better than a Palace, where a Man is under any Restraint and Confine∣ment.</P>
<P>After two Days I made him another Visit, it was Night before I came, and I found him much more chearful than those times I had seen him before; but he was engag'd with a Countryman of his own, who it seems had been drinking <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Ale with him most part of the Afternoon: I told him I was glad to see him look so brisk, and that I hop'd he found himself better. I have been much the better, an∣swer'd he, for my honest Neighbour's Company, whose coming to Town has perfectly reviv'd me; he lives but within three Miles of my House, and he is a Man that, besides some Estate of his own, rents a very good Farm of a neighbouring Gentle∣man, and I believe were you to go to his House, you would say you never met with a more hearty Wel∣come;
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>and I'll say that for him, he always keeps a Glass of as good Ale as any Man in the County. Ay, thank God, says the Countryman, I am never without a Tub of Liquor, tho' it is not so good as the Squire's, yet such homely Fare as we have, this, or any other ho∣nest Gentleman should be welcome to, were they to come our Way. With that the Countryman ask∣ed me if I were Esq; <HI>Pitfal</HI>'s Doctor. When I had satisfied him in that Question, the Countryman re∣ply'd, I thought so by what you said when you came first in, and I was just telling him of a Cure Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> in our Country advis'd my Wife to, for she was much troubled with Wind, as the Esq; is; and that was to swallow three Grains of white Pep∣per whole every Night when she went to Bed, and this cur'd her that she has never been troubled with Wind since, more than any other Woman should be; and I believe, said he, would but the Esq; take that Cure, it would do him as much good as any thing. I told him black Pepper would do every bit as well as white. Ay but, said the Countryman, Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> made my Wife take white Pepper, and it was that cur'd her; and I well remember it, Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> once cur'd me of a great Surfeit which came by a Cold I catch'd when our Waters were up one <HI>Allhallontide.</HI> I came Home miserable bad, for my Mare had swum with me a∣bove half a Mile in the <HI>Burch-lane,</HI> and when the Dr. brought me the Physick, I said I was sure such a small thing as it would do nothing at me, for it was no bigger than a grey Pea; but I my Troth I shall never forget it, for it purg'd me upwards and down∣wards at least twelve or fourteen times, and I was as well in two or three Days as ever I was in all my Life. After this, the Countryman went on in praise of Dr. <HI>Potter,</HI> and was seconded by Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> in all he spoke; he said he was a very ingenious Man, and the strangest Fellow in the World for finding out Peoples Diseases, and for curing them soon, for he
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>always struck at the Cause; and as for broken Bones, he said he would venture to let him loose with any Man in <HI>England.</HI> I made answer, that Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> might be a very knowing Person for any thing I could say to the contrary; but at the same time I observ'd that Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> could sustain no great Loss for the want of him while in <HI>London,</HI> where there were so many able Professors. There is no doubt of that, re∣ply'd the Countryman, for you have all the Learning here, and all the Money too. But I wish Esq; <HI>Pitfal</HI> very well, and the whole Family; I was one of the Stewards to the old Esq; his Father that Year he was made High-Sheriff of our County, and Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> was then but a Stripling; I believe he remembers it well enough, for we had as topping Doings then, as ever was known since in our Parts.</P>
<P>We frequently meet with Men in all Counties, who, besides an uncommon Dexterity in Country Affairs by their unwearied Diligence and Application, be∣come Masters of many of those frugal Maxims of Life which are the best suited to Persons in a Rural Station, by which means they also get the start of many of their Neighbours. This brings them into the Notice of several of the Country Gentlemen, while others, who were once upon a Level with them, are neglected, and the Familiarity to which they are ad∣mitted, creates in them such a Boldness and Confi∣dence, that they never fail, upon all Occasions, to give in their Verdict, tho' in things which are altoge∣ther out of their Depth; and altho' what they say is oftentimes neither very seasonable, nor much to the purpose, yet all this passes for the most part without Reprehension, as the better sort are ever willing to make sufficient Allowance, while the rest are not al∣ways competent Judges. I soon observ'd Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI>'s Country Neighbour to be one of this Stamp. He knows full well, as he imagines, how to exert his Native Property, and values himself much upon it;
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>and as he seems to be a Man perfectly easy in his Circumstances, he spares not those who keep him at his due distance, but will be often very tart in his Expressions against them, tho' no one is more neigh∣bourly, and, as far as is agreeable to his Educa∣tion and Manner of Life, submissive to such of his Superiors as admit him into any degree of Familiarity with them. This makes him have a more than ordinary regard for Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> who is a plain honest Country Gentleman, and lives with him no otherwise than as a good sociable Neighbour. When I had thus discovered what kind of Person the Countryman was, and that there was a mutual Re∣spect between Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> and him, I parted with an Air of Complacency, telling him that nothing should be wanting that might tend to the Gentleman's speedy Recovery.</P>
<P>The next Time I call'd, which was also towards Evening, I found him engag'd, as before, with his Country Neighbour, and a grave elderly Clergyman, who I understood was his Relation; but his Case seem'd to be somewhat worse, and notwithstanding he had been drinking, his Spirits were very low, and he was in a great deal of Despair of his Life; and there was truly a no small Concern perceivable in his Looks. When I ask'd him how he did, the Country∣man, who seem'd also to be in a great deal of Trou∣ble, shook his Head, and, without giving Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> time to answer, said, he believ'd the Esq; would hard∣ly get over this, for he was afraid it had seiz'd his Brain, and that he look'd just as the old Esq; his Fa∣ther did the last time he saw him, which was abour a Week before he dy'd. Upon this I told the Coun∣tryman he was one of <HI>Job</HI>'s Comforters, for there was no Danger of dying, unless Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> should give himself wholly up to Sorrow and Discontent. I took Notice that Fear was a natural Ingredient in the Di∣stemper, and that it never fail'd to produce such Symp∣toms
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>as were now observable in Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> and therefore that it behov'd every one, who kept him Company, to fortify him as much against it as possi∣ble. But when I began to examine more particular∣ly into the Matter, I found he had been tolerably well, until such time as his Cousin the Clergyman came in, who struck a sudden Damp upon his Mind, by telling him that the Stocks had fallen that Day above 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and therefore as soon as I came to learn this, I made use of several Arguments to give a turn to his melancholy Thoughts, and to chear his Spirits, by tel∣ling him that the Price of all such things were preca∣rious; that they were up one Day, and down ano∣ther, and that in time they might perhaps rise as high as ever, and let the worst come, they would hardly sink so low as some People imagin'd. I observ'd that the Care of his Health ought to take place of all o∣ther Temporal Interests, as that was agreeable to the principal Law of Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> Self-preservation; and, I said any one would undoubtedly be thought a Madman, who should love his Money, or any other of his Goods so well, as to hurry himself out of the World for the sake of them. Upon this, the Cler∣gyman also made use of several grave Arguments, telling him, that a Man's Life consists not in the A∣bundance of the Things which he possesseth, and that a small matter, rightly managed, would easily support each individual in all that is absolutely necessary ei∣ther for Life or rational Pleasure. And I found he was also going to put him in Mind wherein to place his true Happiness; but the Countryman, who I ob∣serv'd had been drinking, and was now somewhat fluster'd, broke in upon him, and interrupted him. By the Mass, says he, if that be all troubles the Esq; I think he's to blame; for when he has sold as much as will pay that new Mortgage, he'll have Five hundred a Year still, to my Knowledge, and if he cannot live upon that, believe me, a Lord's Rent would be little
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>enough for him. But while he was going on to take a Survey of all the Manors and Farms belonging to Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> he stop'd him, saying, Thou knowest very well, <HI>Thomas,</HI> when my Father dy'd, there was some Burden upon my Estate, which I was forc'd to clear; Thou knowest likewise, that I am forc'd to pay four∣score Pounds a Year to my Brother <HI>Marle,</HI> who mar∣ried ray Sister <HI>Betty,</HI> as the Interest of her Fortune, and the Principal must be paid when he wants it; and I have a Wife and four Children at Home, besides my Mother's threescore Pounds a Year. God pre∣serve the good old Lady, cry'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> you'll never have the less for her, she has been a good Woman in her time as I believe was in all our Country. But Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> went on and took notice, that his House was grown very old and chargeable in Repairs, and if he had succeeded as he thought once to have done, he intended to have built a new one. I hope, says <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI> you'll take care how you send your Money to the <HI>South-Sea</HI> again, but keep it on the dry Land for the time to come, and with the Grace of God, you may do well enough still, as we live in a Country where all Things are both cheap and plentiful. I seconded what <HI>Thomas</HI> had said, and told Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> that a continued Course of frugal Management in his Affairs at Home would be a means as likely to re∣trieve his past Losses, as could be expected any other way; and tho' the Gain might not be so sudden, yet it would be very certain, as there was still a Foundation for it; besides, that a continual Employ∣ment would give a good relish to his Life, and maintain a constant Series of Health, as that, would never fail to refresh the Mind at all times, and keep up a perfect Sun-shine and Cheerfulness, by the Succession of one easy and useful Project after ano∣ther; and that he might perhaps, at last, find as much Pleasure and real Satisfaction in a gradual retrieving of his Fortune, as if it had been all at once by those new Methods he had propos'd to himself. I observ'd
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>that the Mind of Man was, according to its present State of Existence, incapable of very high or sudden Enjoyments, and that those Persons, who had the weakest Minds, and the least Ability, had common∣ly the most powerful Incentives to prompt them sud∣denly to something they propos'd, as an Ultimate of their Wishes, and that it often far'd with them in the End, as with the fond young Man, who was so much in Love with his own Image in the Water, that he drown'd himself in endeavouring to come at it. I warrant you, said <HI>Thomas,</HI> that was before Looking-Glasses were in Fashion. But I went on, and observ'd, that it was always an Argument of a great Mind to anticipate Disappointments, by laying a just weight on things, and thereby moderating its Desires; and that it was a no less Token of a noble and brave Soul to fight manfully, and boldly encounter Disappoint∣ments when they come; but at the same time I told Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> that I did not apply what I had been saying, in all its Circumstances, to him, for so far as I had learned into his Affairs, I could discover nothing he had aim'd at, but what was very reasonable, and what any other Man in the same Condition would have done as well as he, and that I had only taken the Freedom to use those Arguments, because I would not have his Misfortunes prey upon him so as to in∣jure his Health. Upon this, he assur'd me he aim'd at nothing but to clear his Estate, and that he had never gone that way to work, but that several neigh∣bouring Gentlemen had been in before him, and his Cousin Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> had sent him two Letters about it. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> — said the Countryman: Ay, marry, that's a fine spun Gentleman indeed, and his fine <HI>Lon∣don</HI> Lady; when he was down at the Hall last Sum∣mer was three Years, he said he wondred how Gen∣tlemen could drink Ale as they did; and my Lady, for∣sooth, would not eat ripe Plumbs that came out of one of our Wench's Hands, for fear they were not clean, but gave them to her Woman.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
<P>But all this while, Mr. <HI>Pitfal's</HI> Mind run very much upon his Losses. He ask'd me if I could give any Account of the Nature of the <HI>South Sea,</HI> and what was intended by it. I was not much surpriz'd at this Question, tho' it might no doubt seem very odd from any one who was engag'd in it; yet his Case was the same with many others, who had only in a blindfold Manner followed their Leaders; and it was no Wonder, that a plain country Gentleman should be thus ignorant, when so many Persons about <HI>Lon∣don</HI> were so little acquainted with it, and some of those, Men of Business too. I told him, that to dive into the Nature of that vast Undertaking, so as to give any tolerable Insight into it, either with respect to the Advantages of it, or the manifold Hazards that might be in it, would in my Opinion require more Time and Study, than perhaps every one is aware of. But I said, he could not be ignorant of what was intended by it, <HI>viz.</HI> the Payment of the national Debts; and that in order thereunto, the <HI>South Sea</HI> Company had agreed with the Government to take in most of those Debts and Revenues into their capi∣tal Stock, and had engaged not only to allow every Proprietor such Dividends as would in a few Years pay him his Principal, but his full Interest, propor∣tionable to what had been granted by the Govern∣ment for a longer Term of Years; and besides that, entitle him also to a remaining Capital, which would be very considerable. I observ'd, that this Proposal had so good an Aspect both to the Government, as it would ease the Nation of so heavy a Burden of Debt; and to all the Proprietors, who would be such consi∣derable Gainers by it, that all Persons, who either had Money at command, or could raise it, tho' at never so great a Discount, strove to become Proprie∣tors in it; and sure, said I, the Nation was never known in any Age so well disposed, and so unani∣mous for the good of Posterity, as they have been in
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>this Affair; many Persons of considerable Rank hav∣ing laid by their State, and condescended to mingle with the Crowd, to give the greater Countenance and Encouragement to it. But at this the Clergy∣man took me up very smartly: Pray, Sir, said he, what was the Occasion of all this great Humility in those Persons? do you believe it was from a publick Zeal, or from a View to their own private Interest, that Men of Quality exposed themselves among Crowds of People, and even among the Mob, who at other times would not go one Step to do the least Kindness to a poor indigent Person? I made Answer, that it was not to be doubted, but among so great a Number, there might be some who had chiefly their own Interest in View; but yet, we ought to believe, there were also many, whose Views were more extensive and noble; and who had the good of others, and the Benefit of Posterity most at Heat; and I observ'd, that this Nation was ne∣ver at any Time without a Number of brave Spirits, if not superiour, at least equal to those of any other Country round about us, and that it was to be hop'd the Nation was not now sunk beneath what it had been in all former Ages. But the Clergyman, agreea∣ble to his Function, judg'd according to the Scrip∣ture Rule; I found he was a very great Enemy to all those who sought after Riches, and produced several Texts, particularly against such as hasted to be rich. He also us'd many Arguments in behalf of a true and laudable Industry, and distinguished between that kind of Diligence, which is guided by Virtue, and that which was conducted by Avarice and other vicious De∣sires; after which he ask'd me what Motive could prompt those Persons, who were already remarkable for their vast Possessions, to toil and struggle, and to watch every Opportunity of buying and selling to the greatest Advantage, as if they were the poorest Crea∣tures upon Earth, toiling and labouring for Bread.
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>I made Answer, that I could not indeed commend that Practice; but I said, every Man was willing to keep his Ground, and those who had most, and had always bore the Ascendant over others, were inclina∣ble to do so still; and that I believ'd some of those Persons might be urg'd on, from a Suspicion and Jea∣lousy, lest such, as had been all along inferior to them, should at this Juncture rise up to the same Pitch with themselves; and others, who had been constantly up∣on a level with them, might now also get above them. But the Clergyman insisted that these were Motives neither honourable, nor any ways justifiable; and if there was to be used any other more favourable Pre∣tence, in the behalf of such Persons, <HI>viz.</HI> the Support of the publick Credit, he said, it was the direct Way to destroy it; he took notice that it was the Means to raise it, and give it a Name, but it was only a Monster like the Shadow magnify'd on the Wall by the Light of a Candle, which was no ways propor∣tionable to its Object.</P>
<P>He was at the same time going back to make Al∣lowances for those who were Men of Quality by Birth, but of inconsiderable Fortune, and likewise for such as had been raised into some Station in the World, and had not wherewithal to support it, when the Coun∣tryman broke in upon our Discourse again. He had been all this while leaning forwards, with both his Hands upon the Head of his Stick, and his Face turn'd backwards to us: In this Posture he had been listening very attentively to what we were upon, but being unable to keep silent any longer, he grasped me hastily by the Arm, and stretching out his Neck to∣wards me, till his Mouth approached dole to mine, said he, what in the Name of Mercy do you think they would do with all that Riches and those great Estates if they had them? I was sensible <HI>Thomas</HI> would not be easily put off without an Answer to his Ques∣tion; I therefore observ'd, that the greater a Man's
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>Possessions were, he had, no doubt, the more Power put into his Hands of doing Good, and as those Persons, we had been taking notice of, were supposed to be Men of high and noble Pedigree, and as it might be expected they were virtuous and honourable, and had likewise great and excellent Examples from their own worthy Ancestors; it Was therefore to be hoped they would do nothing that might bring a Stain upon their Families, to sully that Lustre which had been so conspicuous in many of their Progenitors; but if they desired a further Augmentation of their Substances, it was only that they might be able to outshine others in Acts of true Generosity. I told him there were Ways enough to bestow the greatest Superfluities any Man could be Master of; and I said, it was to be presum'd, if those Persons had doubled their Estates, as they were once in a fair way to do, ma∣ny of them would have, no doubt, doubled their Bene∣ficence also, and done much greater Services, not on∣ly to their Country in general, and to all useful Communities of Men, but also to particular Persons. I took notice, it would be then in their Power in a more eminent Manner to support Virtue and Inno∣cence wherever it was under Oppression, to raise up Persons of distinguished Merit, and to depress those, who by their Pride and Insolence were troublesome to their Neighbours. Ay, marry, said <HI>Thomas;</HI> but when will they do all those fine Things you speak of? and with a grinning Laugh, he ask'd if they would build any new Churches. I could not my self forbear smiling at this Question; but to satisfy <HI>Thomas,</HI> I made Answer, that they would, no doubt, among o∣ther Things assist in all such pious Works as these. But <HI>Thomas,</HI> as is usual to such Persons, judg'd of all Men from the few Instances himself was acquainted with. Believe me, said he, if they be all like our Sir <HI>John,</HI> the Parsons may preach in Barns like the Pres∣byterians. There is a Man knows, pointing to Mr.
<PB N="63" REF="66"/><HI>Pitfal,</HI> that our Church has been out of Repair these twenty Years at least, and now it is in so great Dan∣ger of falling, that on a windy Day, I believe verily there are sometimes not above six Men and Women in it besides the Parson, and there are above forty Head in our Parish, who will not venture into it at all, but go to the neighbouring Parishes about. All our Gen∣tlemen in the Neighbourhood, and the whole Parish, have been upon Sir <HI>John</HI> about it, to get us a Brief, because he comes so much to <HI>London</HI> among great Men. He has promis'd many time as fair as any Man can do, and said, he would give a hundred Pound towards it himself; but we cannot see a Penny of his Money, nor the Brief neither, to this Day; but if he was not much bely'd, they say he is able to build twenty Churches himself with the Money he has got out of the <HI>South Sea</HI> lately, and I am sure he was rearing a Dog Kennel when I left home, tho' he comes but seldom to hunt among us, that will be half as good as any Church we have near us. And as for rai∣sing up poor Men, as you was talking, he is so far from doing that, that since he is grown so rich, he'll turn a∣way any Servant that will suffer a poor Man or Wo∣man to come about the House. But, said I, you know, <HI>Thomas,</HI> the old Proverb, <HI>One Swallow makes not a Sum∣mer,</HI> perhaps all your great Men are not like Sir <HI>John.</HI> Ay, marry, answer'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> there is Esq; <HI>Bramble</HI> in the next Parish to ours came down in the beginning of Harvest in a fine Coach, and six tearing Horses in it; when he went up about six Years ago, I think it may be thereabouts, as near as I can remember, his Estate was not counted to be better than Esq; <HI>Pitfal</HI>'s, and some say it was not so good; but believe me, we thought he had a mind to buy the whole County when he came down this last Time, for he bid Mo∣ney for every Body's Estate, and among the rest, would have fain had my bit of Land, and offer'd me a very topping Price for it, I'll assure you. But I thank
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>God I had no occasion to part with the little I had; but he was at me every Day about it, and sent for me to his House, and was so kind as never was known; he said his Steward should put my Money in the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> where in two or three Months time it might be worth 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year. You'll say that was a pretty thing enough, but his Steward was a Stranger among us, and never trust me, but I think now it's as well where it is. But all this while, said I, Mr. <HI>Bramble</HI> may be a very good Man, and perhaps may do great Kindnesses to your Country, as he is now become so rich. Ay, answer'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> if he end as he has begun, I doubt we shall have such doings as has not been known in our Parts. He brought down a parcel of fine dancing Fellows with white Gloves. People said they were his Footmen; but by Lady, I think they were more like Gentlemen, and turn'd a∣way most of his old Servants, except one or two that his Lady would have him keep. Some of them had liv'd there in the old Esq; his Father's time, and I dare say there was none of them would have wrong'd him of a Hair's breadth; but he said it was a Dis∣grace to see such Fellows about a Gentleman's House; he warn'd away two of the oldest Tenants on his E∣state too, whose Leases were almost up, to make way for a Friend of his new Steward's, who they say is to rent both Farms. I cannot tell how all things will end, but I hear he is for being off his Bargain a∣gain in most of the Estates he has bought about us. I said indeed, these were Instances enough of Gentle∣men departing from the Footsteps of their Forefa∣thers, for I wanted very much that <HI>Thomas</HI> should make an end, but this Expression set him on foot again. Ay, marry, answer'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> if I were to go thro' our County, I warrant I could tell you half a score more. There is the Lawyer who came down with Esq; <HI>Bramble,</HI> and bought Esq; <HI>Clover</HI>'s Estate, but he's but a new Comer among us, they say, has
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>got a Notion of Money in that <HI>South Sea;</HI> but I think he is like to do but little good with it. How so, said I? How, answered <HI>Thomas,</HI> he brought a young Damsel, with her wide Petticoats down with him, to be his House-keeper, as I understand; and when I went to him about an Affair of my Wife's Brother, who was one of Esq; <HI>Clover</HI>'s Tenants before this new one came among us, who should come to speak to me but this Whisk? I told her I had no Business with her, but I wanted her Master; but the Flirt scoffed at me, and ask'd one of the fine Fellows that was in the Hall, what the Country Calf meant; but I heard her well enough, and I think I gave her her own. I told her there was no such Cattle as she ever us'd to be in this House before. This somewhat heightned my Curiosity, whereupon I ask'd him if he saw the new Esq; Ay, marry, answered <HI>Thomas;</HI> after I had waited till I was welly tir'd; I was at last brought in to his Worship, who was sitting in a fine silk Robe, like a Lady, picking and scraping his Nails with a fine Tortoiseshell Knife; but how strange∣ly were things alter'd there from what they were in Esq; <HI>Clover</HI>'s Time? I came away without being so muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as ask'd to drink a Cup of small Beer, tho' I had come above seven Miles that Morning. I ob∣serv'd to him that it was not the Custom among Gen∣tlemen, who had been us'd to Business about <HI>London,</HI> to drink before Dinner, and that most Men were apt to judge of other Peoples Inclinations by their own; that it might perhaps be otherwise when he came to be acquainted with the manner of the Country, and as for keeping a good neat House-keeper, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid such Things were not much thought of in our Times. By the Mass, reply'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> I think that's bad enough, tho' I could ee'n almost pardon that too, if he were good for any Thing in other Matters; but the second or third Day after he came to his new Estate, he caus'd two little Cottages in the Lane, as ye go up to
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>the House, to be pulled down, which had stood there, for ought I know, all Esq; <HI>Clover</HI>'s Time, and the poor People and their little ones have been forc'd o lie in the Barns ever since, and, as I understand, it was to please this Wagtail, for she said they and their Brats stunk with Nastiness. I could not indeed but take Notice of that as an Act of great Cruelty; but <HI>Thomas</HI> told me, there was a Copse of Shrub upon the Brook-side on his Ground, which us'd, Time out of Mind, to be free to all the poor People thereabouts to gather Sticks to burn, and that he had given out Or∣ders, if any presum'd to go there any more, he would send them to the House of Correction. That he had also stop'd up the Water-Course to a Gentleman's Mill, which ran through his Ground; and said he would oblige him to pay a new Fine, because he found the Gentleman had omitted for two or three Years giving some small Thing to Squire <HI>Clover,</HI> that was to be paid every Year as an Acknowledgment for the same.</P>
<P>These, and many other Instances, the Country∣man told me concerning this Gentleman's Conduct, which were not only ungenerous, but cruel; and, if rightly look'd into, must be also accounted foolish and imprudent; and he was going on to give us In∣stances of the Misbehaviour of some other Gentlemen in the same Neighbourhood; but altho' there might be some Instruction gather'd from all he said, yet I had not Time to hear more of them, especially with the Circumstances which are usual in his way of re∣hearsing them. I told him, I should be glad to be further inform'd in those Things, when I had more Leisure; whereupon he sum'd up all in this general Observation: Verily, said he, I thought we had been like our Neighbours, but mayhap other Coun∣tries may be better than ours, and may have such fine Gentlemen in them as you have been talking of; but I wot they are but thin in our Parts; unless it be
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>Squire <HI>Pitfal,</HI> and some other honest Gentlemen; there are but few of our great ones will suffer poor Men to get any thing under them.</P>
<P>But this gave the Clergyman an Opportunity to reassume his Discourse. He observ'd, that altho' Ri∣ches were, next to Health, one of the greatest tempo∣ral Blessings to all those who knew how to use them aright; yet nothing could be so great a Snare, and so destructive to Persons of vicious Inclinations, as they were the proper Food and Nourishment of all their Lusts; and because of the Power and Authori∣ty which accompany'd them, he said, when they were once in the Possession of bad Men, they were like a Sword in the Hands of a Tyrant, which cut with∣out Mercy, as they enabled such the more violently to oppress others. He took notice, that many of those who were born to great Fortunes, were often∣times a Blessing to their Country, as were also those who acquir'd a moderate Substance by their honest Industry and Labour; but, on the other hand, that such who became Masters of very great and uncom∣mon Acquisitions by their boundless Avarice, were for the most part a Plague to all who were about them, or had any Concerns with them; and that he believ'd there was no Country more than another free from such Persons, who being emulous, or rather en∣vious, at the Prosperity and good Fortune of others, stuck at nothing to come up with them, tho' by all the cruel Methods of Oppression. He observ'd, as the Body was nourish'd by its proper Food, so a Gra∣tification of our Desires and Inclinations was the pro∣per Food of our Minds, but with this Difference, that the Body was often satisfy'd, and even surfeited, but the Mind could seldom have enough, especially when it was guided by vicious Appetites; it might indeed be heated and intoxicated, but that would, like all other Drunkenness, only increase the Thirst. This he observ'd was so manifest, with respect to Riches,
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>that no one could be insensible of it, after so univer∣sal an Infatuation of that kind as had happen'd late∣ly among us; but what, said he, must have been the End of all this, had every thing succeeded according to Mens vain Wishes? Any one who had been but some few Years out of his native Country, would have hardly known it upon his Return, the Face of Things would have been so strangely chang'd, and the Pos∣sessions of Men passing through so many Hands, would have, no doubt, caus'd as many Alterations as there were different Humours and Passions in those Par∣ties to have been gratify'd; what one would have built, another would have pull'd down, and what one had planted, another would have soon rooted up; and such an infinite Number of strange Projects would have been set on Foot, as were never heard of before. But he took notice, that the Methods of Providence were for the most part deliberate and slow, especially those that were the most favourable; and tho' the Wheel was indeed turn'd more about, at some particular Times, than what is ordinary, where∣by many strange Revolutions were accomplish'd, yet such Things did not happen often, neither would we be able to bear them, if they were either to be fre∣quent, or the Hurry of them was to last any Time.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> as himself was deepliest engag'd in this Affair, and had hitherto understood but little of the Matter, was therefore willing to know something more particularly about it. He put a Stop to the Clergyman, while he was making those general Ob∣servations, and ask'd him, What he judg'd to be the Reason why the <HI>Stocks</HI> had risen so high? And why, all of a sudden, they should fall so low? To this he made An∣swer, That Mens Avarice had, no doubt, been the Cause of the prodigious Rise, as that extraordinary Height was with no less Probability the Occasion of the Fall. He observ'd to him, that according to the Footing it was put upon, the Advantages to every Ad∣venturer
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>were in a great Measure to be proportional∣ble to the Advantage of Credit; and for that Reason, as the Credit was advanc'd, the Number of Purcha∣sers also increas'd, which was easily enough to be ex∣pected in a Nation so rich and populous as this is. The Gains that some boasted of, and that others had really made, set all Persons agog after it, and so sweet was the Prospect of getting suddenly rich, that those were look'd upon as Fools and Asses who had the least Diffidence in it; as on the other hand, the grea∣test Blockneads were countenanc'd, who could glean up any thing to its Advantage, tho' never so absurd and ridiculous. He observ'd, that as most Persons, who were concern'd in it, had their own private Gains chiefly in view, and thought but little of the Publick; whatever therefore they had ventur'd, was only with a Design to transfer it to some other Hand, as soon as they imagin'd it come to its utmost; and as there were but few, however, forward in it, who car'd to trust it longer than while it was upon the ri∣sing hand, it must have had the same Fate at whate∣ver Time it came to a stand; and unless the Ad∣vance of Credit was no more than could bear a rea∣sonable Balance with our real Substance, it was im∣possible that it could be supported, especially, consi∣dering the various Humours, Interests, and Tempers of Men, and the vast Numbers concern'd in it, but must be like a Ship at Sea, which is apt to sink when she is either over-burden'd with too much Sail, or oppress'd with too high and violent Winds. But be∣sides that evil Humour which he observ'd to run more or less through the whole Body, he said, it was to be fear'd some of the principal Members were parti∣cularly in fault, both in the excessive Rise and Fall; and as the Eyes of all Persons were, no doubt, up∣on those who were most deeply concern'd, their Example could not avoid being strictly follow'd; and the Consequence of this must be to sink the publick
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>Credit very much lower than was any ways rea∣sonable.</P>
<P>Upon this, Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> ask'd him, Whether he thought it would rise again? He made Answer, As the Hopes of getting Riches had encourag'd People to adventure boldly, and become Proprietors even be∣yond what many of them were able; so, after so great a Damp, the Fear of losing, as that was of e∣qual, if not superiour Importance on the Mind, would, no doubt, hinder many for some Time from becom∣ing Purchasers; but yet as there was perhaps no just Reason for its sinking so low; and as there was such a vast Number of Persons, and those of all Ranks, immediately concern'd in it, and as the whole Na∣tion was now in a manner link'd into it, it was not therefore improbable, but such prudent Measures would be taken, as would not only in time raise it to a moderate Height, but also support it; and it was likewise to be hop'd, that those who had hitherto on∣ly an Eye to their own private Interest, would hence∣forward believe, as they were all Members of the same Body, that nothing would in the End turn so much to their real Account, as consulting the Inte∣rest of other Persons, as well as their own.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> began now to be more chearful, and his country Neighbour was no less encourag'd to see him so; he jog'd him on the Arm, and drank to his good Success, telling him, That he hop'd to see <HI>Maple-Hall</HI> new built in a shorter Time than he thought for; and after the Glass had gone round, and that I was go∣ing to take my Leave of him, I desir'd him to be of good Courage, to wait with Patience, and not to be troubled or anxious about his Interest in the Publick; since, as the Gentleman had observ'd, the ablest and greatest Men in the Nation were concern'd in it as well as he, and that therefore there would be suffi∣cient Care taken of it; and as he was to go shortly into the Country, I put him in Remembrance of the
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>Advice I had already given him, to keep himself al∣ways employ'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some useful Business or another, and, at proper times, said he might also drink a Glass, in Moderation, with his Friends, which would not only be the likeliest Means to recover him, but also to preserve him in a perfect State of Health, as the Intervals of Business and Company would keep off all melancholy Reflexions.</P>
