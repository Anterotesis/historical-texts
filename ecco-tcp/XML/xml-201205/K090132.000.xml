<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE I present this Book to the World in general, with∣out dedicating it to any Per∣son to protect me, it may be necessary to say something in my own De∣fence.</P>
<P>What I write is from Remarks on Na∣ture, and Practical Observations, with an Intention to improve the Method of cur∣ing Diseases; for the Art of healing is in a declining Way, the Practice of Physick, is become a Perfect Ceremony; that strong Beam, which ought to support it, is di∣vided into different Branches: Here is one Man shall be a Physician, another a Sur∣geon, one an Apothecary, another a Chy∣mist, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus (in this present Age) each
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>Man sticks to his particular Branch, and thinks it Scandal to meddle or interfere, with any more than one Part only; but in former Ages, a Man was not deem'd worthy to be call'd a Physician, unless he was Mas∣ter of every one of these following Arts.</P>
<P><HI>(First.)</HI> Physiology, or a Knowledge of Human Nature.</P>
<P><HI>(Secondly.)</HI> Anatomy, or a Knowledge of the Parts of Human Bodies.</P>
<P><HI>(Thirdly.)</HI> Pharmacy and Chymistry, or the Method of making all manner of Me∣dicines.</P>
<P>Indeed, the First and Principal Point is, judging and distinguishing the Dis∣eases, and Causes of Diseases ; but it is impossible for a Physician to be perfect in this Point, until he is perfect in Ana∣tomy and Surgery: For I call Surgery the Practical Part of Anatomy; there being more Experience gain'd from Accidental Practice and Observations upon living Bo∣dies, than from Lectures and Courses of Anatomy over dead Bodies.</P>
<P>Likewise it is as necessary for a Physici∣an, to know the different Qualities of Me∣dicines,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>that he may be able to relieve the different Disorders which Human Bodies are afflicted with: Therefore, every Prac∣titioner ought to know the preparing of all Kind of Medicines, for both Internal and External Uses; because the Maker of Me∣dicines, or Things of any Kind, is most able to know the Power of such Things as he himself hath made.</P>
<P><HI>Paracelsus</HI> call'd Physick a Short Art, meaning, that when it is Short and Easy it is most Perfect: For where the Prac∣tice is long and tedious, the Patient suf∣fers; and when Writings are long and te∣dious, the Reader's Mind is no Ways im∣prov'd thereby: but Books are too com∣monly esteem'd according to the Fame of the Author, and when any Thing new is publish'd, the first Enquiry is, who is the Author? Instead of, what has he wrote?</P>
<P>Although I say something in Oppositi∣on to the present Rules in Physick, I do not rise up against the Physicians in general; for I know some Excellent Men in Prac∣tice, whose Methods I always observ'd to improve my own Thoughts, so far I am in∣debted;
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>therefore I will say nothing that shall offend the Wise and Worthy; but a∣gainst Ignorance and Envy there can be no Defence, since People will always have dif∣ferent Tastes; some Persons like a Surgeon for being diligent in dressing a Green Wound, twice a Day, when certainly, the oftner a Green Wound is open'd, the longer it must be before it heals, because the Air makes a Wound more tender, and hinders the Fibres from uniting. Others like a Phy∣sician, under whose Care they are always sick.</P>
<P>And some People like to read Books, which confound their Understanding; I might name a certain Author, in great Esteem, who at his Beginning, takes up five Pages in explaining the Word Dis∣ease; now I will explain the meaning of the Word, Disease, in a few Lines.</P>
<P>Suppose I find a Person uneasy, I may then say he has a Dis-ease, because he is not at Ease; and so may we say of Tem∣per, and Dis-temper. Thus I would make the Path of Practice, Plain and Easy, there∣fore, I will begin first with the Nerves and Senses, by way of Introduction.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE observ'd that seve∣ral Authors who have wrote upon the Animal Spirits, with∣out explaining themselves, have been ridicul'd and condemn'd, for picking out an Abstruse Term, to build an Argument upon; and as my Thoughts may lead me to make use of that Term, I will tell the Reader what I mean thereby; in Hopes it may in some Measure defend me from Calumny, or at least vindicate other Authors: For certainly every Man has an Idea of what he writes; indeed he may not measure it out to the Understand∣ing of every Reader.</P>
<P>Therefore, when I say the Animal Spi∣rits, I mean the Principal Seat of Know∣ledge, where the Prime Sense gives imme∣diate Judgment between Pain and Plea∣sure;
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>and these following Gates, lead there∣to, as, Seeing, Hearing, Tasting, Smelling, and Feeling.</P>
<P>Yet the Mind, or Animal Spirits, can conceive either Fear, Grief, or Joy, with∣out drawing it in by any of those Organs; but when one Person infects another, with either Fear, Joy, or Pain, it must then be carried to the Prime Seat of Know∣ledge, by some one of the five Senses: And when any Hurt or Surprize, Infecti∣on of Fear, or Malignity of any Kind, reaches the Animal Spirits, or the Prime Seat of Sense, from thence is shewn an Antipathy in all the Nerves, by a rigorous shivering and shaking of every Muscle, throughout the whole Body; and it is then (as in Holy Writ) that the Keepers of the House shall tremble, Fears being in the Way.</P>
<P>Now I must own, the <HI>Liquidum Ner∣vorum,</HI> (or rather the Nerves themselves) may properly be call'd the Animal Spirits.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>But nearer to the Fountain Head,</HI></L>
<L><HI>More Crystal flows the Silver Stream.</HI></L>
</LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<P>For certainly the Nerves are govern'd by the Mind, and Force or Quickness of Thought, as is plainly demonstrated, when we catch a flying Ball, or when we defend our Heads from a Blow, our Arm is then mov'd by the Nerves guiding the Muscles, yet the Nerves are directed by the Mind; for although the Performances and OEco∣nomy of the Nerves, are noble, they are not design'd (by Nature) to contract, or extend a Muscle, without Order from the Mind, or Prime Seat of Sense.</P>
<P>Moreover when it happens (contrary to Nature) that any of the Nerves contract a Muscle, without Commission from the Mind, that Muscle so mov'd, is then cramp'd, or in Convulsion.</P>
<P>Therefore as the Mind commands the Nerves, the Mind or Thought, must be the Animal Spirit; likewise the Mind must be the Throne of the Soul.</P>
<P>Thus in pursuit of Nature, as one hard Cause we overtake, still harder stand before us; so from Cause to Cause, our Thoughts are led, even to that mighty Power, the
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>Sun, by whose Beams we live, move, and generate.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Without that Warmth, and lively Light,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So mortal Cold this Globe would be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That Nature must in Darkness fix,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And every Thing that's living dye.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>For the Sun is Nature's Lord, the first Power from God, and the only Cause of the Course and Changes of Things on this Earth.</P>
<P>The Moon has no Influence over Hu∣man Bodies, nor over any Thing on this Globe: Indeed, the Tide keeps Time with the Moon; but it is because the Moon and the Earth both, have the same Circular Motion to the Sun.</P>
<P>I would demonstrate how the Tide, is caus'd, by the Atmosphere pressing against the Sea, as the Earth moves; and how the Wind, and Combustions of Weather, are caus'd by a Fermentation in the At∣mosphere; but it would be tedious here, and keep me from what I propose, which is chiefly to treat on Distempers, and Hu∣man Nature.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Malignant Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>FEVERS commonly call'd Ma∣lignant, being in their Nature most subtle and severe, which prey upon the Animal Spirits, some Time before the Blood is infected.</P>
<P>This Kind of Fever does not proceed from contagious Particles in the Air; nor is it infectious any otherwise, than by our being afraid of it, and thus it gets Pos∣session into the Prime Fancy or Animal Spirits, by conceiving a Fear of Death within ourselves, upon any slight Illness, or sudden Surprize of Danger; and the most dangerous Symptom is, when the Thoughts have drawn in an Apprehensi∣on and Dread of Death, upon the Spirits; for without this Dread, it is not a real Malignant Fever.</P>
<P>The Sick is seiz'd at first, with a Shi∣vering and Coldness, a weary Pain and Weakness, throughout the whole Body, proceeding from that Disorder upon the Nerves and Spinal Marrow, which ren∣der
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>the Sinews and Muscles incapable of doing their Offices; likewise a continual reaching to vomit, and a Watchfulness upon the Spirits, which hinders him from sleeping, although he's attended with a great Drowsiness, these are the Symptoms of a Malignant Fever, at the first Ap∣proach, before the Blood is inflam'd. The Patient should then by all means submit himself to his Bed, and not strive against Nature; for she will not be conquer'd.</P>
<P>Now a Physician being call'd, he pre∣scribes according to his Judgment, for Physicians differ in their Methods of Practice, as they do in their Opinions, and full as much as Human Bodies differ in their Constitutions; some will boldly give purging Medicines, others give Su∣dorisicks, and some Blister more and more, even to the last Gasp.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to be a Pilot; I only wish the Wanderer may know, which Path will mislead him; as for Blistering, I cannot see why it should do any Hurt, yet I may reasonably make an Objection, since Practice has convinc'd me, that Bli∣sters
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>afford no Relief in real Malignant Fevers. Purging is an Ignorant Proceed∣ing, and dangerous; for all sudden Eva∣cuations, or immoderate Discharges, add to the Rigour and Anxiety of the Mind, therefore must tend to destroy Life, ra∣ther than save. Sudorificks are very proper, if we use such as may bring on gentle Sweats; for if the Sweats come on excessively, Nature will be reduced so low, as to be past defending herself, so Critical are these Malignant Fevers; and likewise if we find a Difficulty in bring∣ing the Patient to sweat, we must forbear heating Medicines, otherwise we shall put the Blood into a violent Ebullition, and hurry the Patient out of the World, when perhaps, if he had been supply'd with a proper Regimen, yielding to Nature, he might have recover'd, by the Help of gentle Cardiack, and Diluting Medicines. The <HI>Lapis Contrayerva,</HI> and Testace∣ous Powders repeated often, and given in a Julep of Black-Cherry Water, Syrup of Saffron and Compound Piony Water, will help to correct the Acidity in the Sto∣mach
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>and cherish the Animal Spirits; for if we can find out how, and where Nature is oppress'd, we then must use Means to set her Free, that she may (on her own Accord) bring on such Sweats, as are not only necessary and wonder∣ful, but highly preferable to all that can be forc'd by Art.</P>
<P>The only Sudorifick Medicine that I ever found effectual in Malignant and Pestilential Fevers, is the Elixir of Vipers, as I have set down in the Chapter of In∣flammatory Fevers; in it, there is a subtle Virtue, which never fails to bring on the Moderate and Necessary Sweats, and as if it were a Specifick, temperates the Ani∣mal Spirits, without augmenting the Heat in the Blood: But it is impossible to set a Rule to practise by, in either Acute or Chronical Diseases; nor even how to or∣der a proper Regimen, or a fit Liquor for the Patient in a Malignant Fever; per∣haps the Physician may order Chicken Broth, which certainly is very proper, if the Patient can drink as much as his Fe∣ver requires; but after he has drank one
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>Sort of Liquor five of six Times, he bears so great an Antipathy to it, that his Stomach will not take the same Liquor any longer, yet he is confin'd to it for several Days; this Way of restraining the Patient to one Sort of Liquor, is barbarous, if rightly consider'd; for we should endeavour to find out which Sort of Liquor he likes, and divert him with Variety of Liquors; first one Sort, and then another. By this Means, he will drink as much as is Necessary: Proper Liquors in Fevers are Broths, Sage-Tea, Sack-Whey, Pectoral Drinks, White Drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, if the Patient should have a Longing, or Desire for a Draught of Small Beer, we should by all means let him have it, with a Piece of Bread put into it burn∣ing hot: This sometimes is of singular Ser∣vice, by affording a Satisfaction to the Mind; for every Thing that is grateful to a Person in a Fever, gives a Courage and better enables him to endure his Afflic∣tion.</P>
<P>It may be of some Weight, to set down the Qualifications of a Good Nurse, one who is chearful, obedient, and watch∣ful;
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>not one that reads, sighs, and whis∣pers in the Room, as if she was talking to a Spirit: but this I mention by the bye, because the Patient never sleeps in a Ma∣lignant Fever, being so very watchful he on∣ly slumbers, and when he hears any Whis∣pering, he is affrighted, and commonly starts up to listen; so it infects his Thoughts with fresh Dreads, and thus it hurts him, because the Malignity of this Fever is Rigour and Fears upon the Mind or Ani∣mal Spirits; therefore I advise the Nurse to speak out briskly, or be quite silent, likewise to move briskly, or sit quite still.</P>
<P>But, as I was saying before, how unsea∣sonably Proper Remedies may be apply'd, as in this Fever, Bleeding may be of great Service, when the Blood comes to too High a Fermentation, but if on the con∣trary we should bleed at the first Approach of the Disease, we shall thereby conceal the Fever upon the Spirits, and depress Nature, insomuch that the Patient dyes in a Languid Manner.</P>
<P>Nor do I digress by bringing in compara∣tively, how improper it would be, to give
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>the Jesuit's Bark in the Cold shivering Fit of an Intermittent Fever. I might note se∣veral other Proofs, while I am treating of Malignant Fevers, since the Word Ma∣lign alludes to all that is unfavourable, severe, and dangerous; yet I will explain the Nature of Pestilential, and Inflammato∣ry Fevers, the Small Pox, and other Di∣stempers, singularly and faithfully, as far as I have observ'd, by looking from one Cause into another.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Pestilential Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>PEstilential Fevers are in no wise more dangerous, than the Fever describ'd in the foregoing Chapter, although the Name may sound more terrible. Indeed Pestilential Fevers are very fatal in one Respect, by running through whole Fa∣milies and Towns, for several Miles, as if the Air was loaded with Contagious Particles.</P>
<P>I believe, the wisest Men that ever wrote were always lost by looking into
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>the Causes and Nature of Infection; and as several Authors have attempted it, I will venture to give my Opinion, in Hopes it may, in some Measure, conduct those Men into right Notions, that are capable of judging mine to be wrong.</P>
<P>Then in my way of Thinking, Infecti∣on most commonly is drawn into Hu∣man Bodies, by the Power of Sympathy and Antipathy, working upon the Nerves or the Mind: As for Example; when one Person complains to another, that he feels an unwholesome Rawness in the Air; the other whom he complains to, will be apt to draw the same Notion into his own Mind; likewise when one in Company gapes or yawns for Sleep, others in the same Company, who bear the least Sympathy to Drowsiness, will be soon seiz'd with the like gaping or yawning; besides, it is worth observing, how a Dampness in a Room just wash'd, or Damp Linen hanging in a Room, will infect those who bear an Antipathy thereto, yet it very seldom hurts those who are in no wise afraid of such like Dampnesses; and also, as the Sweet
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>Notes, and Swells in Musick, only ele∣vates such Souls as feel its Charms, so any Particulr Impureness in the Air, can on∣ly infect such Bodies as are fit to receive that Kind of Impureness; and thus it comes to pass, that the Small Pox cannot infect those who have had the Small Pox before, because their Bodies are not capable of receiving that kind of Infection; and most certainly every one's Body is not at all Times in a Disposition for admitting in a Pestilential Contagion; and as Nature hath order'd that such Fevers as begin with great Violence, by the same Rule, shall the sooner come to a Crisis.</P>
<P>A Pestilential Fever is attended with various Symptoms from the Beginning, through the whole Course; but com∣monly at its first coming, it seizes with great violence the Head, Stomach, and Lungs; the Blood soon takes the Flame in this Fever, and the Heat being then in the greatest Degree, Nature begins to strive to force out the Enemy, either by Carbuncles, Biles, Eruptions in the Skin, or Excessive Sweats, and sometimes a vio∣lent
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>Looseness, which is the worst of all the foregoing Symptoms, and I can scarce believe that Nature brings on a Looseness of her own Accord; I rather think it is caus'd by forcing the Sick to take some Medicines, or perswading him to eat some Victuals his weak Stomach cannot bear. The Patient finds Relief from all the other Symptoms, for as the Blood receives the Fever, the Animal Spirits are in some Measure reliev'd; therefore the Physician must always endeavour to promote the foregoing Symptoms: Since it is certain, unless some of 'em concur, the Patient must die in a few Hours, by the Animal Spirits being overset with the Violence of the Fever.</P>
<P>There commonly is a continual Keck∣ing in drawing in the Breath, which is a strong Proof that raw and unwholesome Air, has made an Impression upon the Lungs. By this Disorder, in drawing in the Breath, the Stomach becomes very weak and unfit to receive many Medi∣cines; therefore as Alexipharmacks are
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>most proper, we must be very careful not to give such as are too loading.</P>
<P>Pestilential Fevers require a great quan∣tity of diluting Liquors, for which rea∣son we must endeavour, as much as possi∣ble, to relieve the Disorder in the Stomach and Lungs, that he may be able to drink as much as is necessary.</P>
<P>Blisters are of great Service in Pesti∣lential Fevers, for relieving both the Head and Lungs; and to correct the Stomach, let the Patient take the following Draught every four Hours.—Take Salt of Worm∣wood, a Scruple; Juice of Lemons, half an Ounce; mix'd together in a large Cup, and stir it till it has done fermenting; then put to it an Ounce of Barley Cinnamon Water. As this Draught must be repeated, it will be convenient to mix up six times the Quantity at once, and divide it.</P>
<P>If the Fever, or the Heat in the Blood, should be very violent, it will be necessa∣ry to keep the Body open by Glysters, or gentle Lenitives, such as Manna, or a Decoction made of Tamerinds and Senna, of each two Drams, and Salt of Worm∣wood,
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>ten Grains, boil'd in two Ounces of Water; as soon as it boils, take if from the Fire, and strain it off, before it is quite cold. This is an excellent Cathar∣tick, yet, if misapply'd, it is liable to do Mischief.</P>
<P>I have been told of Bleeding to the Quantity of an hundred Ounces at once, but they must know very little of Anato∣my that believe it; yet I confess, in my Opinion, when we bleed in Pestilential Fevers we ought to take a large Quan∣tity, in order to asswage the Heat, or Vi∣olence of the Fever: for by taking the common Quantity, which is about ten Ounces, we only depress the natural Course of the Distemper, and prolong the Grie∣vances the Patient lyes under.</P>
<P>The Testaceous Powders are hurtful in this Fever, by reason that the Stomach abounds with Phlegm, and Oily Medi∣cines are improper for no other reason, than the Stomach being weak, and can∣not bear 'em.</P>
<P>Thus the Symptoms of every Disease, must always indicate what Remedies, and
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>when they ought to be applied; only let this be a standing Rule, what Medicines soever are fit to be given in Pestilential Fevers, ought to be made up in little Quantities, and repeated often.</P>
<P>I should be glad to find out better Rules, but so critical and various are the Symp∣toms in Fevers, that he may be deem'd an exceeding good Practitioner that does no hurt in them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Inflammatory Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>FEVERS under this Denomination, affect the Body by a Flux of inflam'd Blood, falling on particular Parts, caus'd frequently by drinking cold Liquors, or some sudden Coldness in the Air, at a time when the Body is overheated; so this In∣flammatory Fever comes in either a Pleu∣risy, a Quinzy, or a <HI>St. Anthony's</HI> Fire.</P>
<P>These Fevers are not without Danger, although the Animal Spirits be not infest∣ed with Dread and Malignity, yet Nature
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>may be overset by the violent Heat in the Blood.</P>
<P>In these kind of Fevers it is necessary to keep the Body open, by cooling Gly∣sters, and diluting Purgatives; for Relief is given by all moderate Evacuations, bleeding in particular: Sweating is of great service, only Sudorificks are so very apt to inflame the Blood; but our Method of Practice is so common in those Cases, that I need not mention bleeding, blistering, and other Applications. My Design is on∣ly to set down such things as have not been explain'd hitherto, and such things as may be useful hereafter, for which reason I will set down a Fomentation for the Part affected in a <HI>St. Anthony's</HI> Fire, which I have experienc'd, and know to be valuable.</P>
<P>Take a Pint of Lime-Water, make it boiling hot, put to it a Pint of rectify'd Spirit of Wine, it will be of a right Heat, and must be appli'd thus; wrap a Lin∣nen Cloth (not Woollen) round, or upon the Inflammation, so that the Cloth may be four or five in thickness, then pour this
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>Mixture through the Cloth: upon the in∣flam'd Part; this repeated three times a Day, without taking off the Cloth, is much preferable to camphorated Spirit of Wine, Poultices, or any kind of Hot Fomentation; yet we must use inward Means, at the same Time, to cool the Bo∣dy, and temper the Fermentation in the Blood.</P>
<P>But it happens sometimes, that these Fevers are attended with all the ill Symp∣toms of a Malignant Fever, which is very fatal to the Patient, and renders the Cure more difficult to the Physician; for al∣though the Blood being sizy, indicates both bleeding, blistering, and other Eva∣cautions, yet the Rigour upon the Ani∣mal Spirits, contradicts that way of Pro∣ceeding, because both bleeding and blister∣ing depress Nature, and irritate the Ani∣mal Spirits, and is apt to bring on greater Rigour and Dread. Therefore in a Ma∣lignant Pleurisy, I will recommend an In∣fusion of Stone-Horse Dung, made thus: Take six Globules of the Horse Dung, and pour upon it a Quart of the Pectoral De∣coction,
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>boiling Hot; let it stand to in∣fuse in an Earthen Vessel, close cover'd, about an Hour, then strain it off: This In∣fusion both temperates and comforts the Animal Spirits, and commonly keeps the Patient in a gentle Sweat; for gentle Sweats tend to a Recovery, but by ex∣cessive Sweats, Nature is overset, and the Physician often deceiv'd by the Patient dying at a time, when he thought him past all Danger. The foregoing Infusion is to be drank frequently, very Hot, about a Quarter of a Pint at a time.</P>
<P>Let the Patient take about thirty Drops of the Elixir of Vipers, in a Cup of the aforesaid Infusion, twice a Day; it is pro∣per to keep his Body open by Glysters, but not to purge upon any Account, un∣til all the Symptoms of Malignity are va∣nish'd.</P>
<P>If the Patient's Stomach will bear to take a Bolus, make him up two Scruples of <HI>Edenborough</HI> Treacle, and six Grains of Salt of Amber; this must be given eve∣ry six Hours, with a Draught of the afore∣said Infusion, or any other diluting Li∣quor
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>quor after it, for we must not confine him to the Infusion of Horse Dung, though it is wonderful in this Case; we must di∣vert him with a Change, when he's tir'd of any one sort of Liquor.</P>
<P>As I have mentioned the Elixir of Vi∣pers, I will set it down before I go any farther, that I may not be accus'd of Quackery, or designing this Book an Ad∣vertisement for my own Interest.</P>
<P>Take the Skins of Vipers, dry'd and powder'd, Millepedes dry'd, Contrayer∣va Roots in Powder, of each an Ounce, mix these Ingredients into a Past in a Glass Mortar, with two Ounces of Spirit of Salt, tye the Mortar close over with a Bladder, let it stand for five or six Days, then put it into a Florence Flask, with four Ounces of Spirit of <HI>Nitre Dulcis,</HI> let it stand to digest in the Sun, or a gen∣tle Sand Heat, ten or twelve Days, then press it out, and filter it, it must be kept in a Bottle with a Glass Stopper, for it will corrode, and eat a common Cork. This Medicine opens all Obstructions in the Body, and wonderfully revives, and
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>cherishes the Mind, or Animal Spirits; also causes Perspiration, and quickens Vital Motion.</P>
<P>Yet every Professor of Physick, knows not when, and how to apply a good Me∣dicine, no more than every Man in Jack Boots, is fit to mount the manag'd Horse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Intermittent Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Fevers vary both according to the Difference in Constitutions, and Degrees of Malignity, therefore liable to be a Quotidian, a Tertian, or a Quar∣tan: The most favourable sort is, when it comes every Day; the next in Degree, is when it intermits one Day; and the worst sort of all, is when the Patient is well two Days together, and the third Day has his Fever.</P>
<P>There is yet another Sort, which is commonly call'd a double Tertian: In this the Patient is ill two Days together, and well the third; this is thought the worst Species of all Intermittents; but whosoe∣ver
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>examins strictly, will find it only a Quartan Ague, wherein Nature is by some Means obstructed, so that she cannot ex∣pel the Malignity by Sweats the first Day; so the Fever remains two Days together. I have observ'd the Patient to sweat the first Day, but not a Discharge sufficient for a Quartan Ague, which is not a jot inferiour to either a Malignant, or a Pesti∣lential Fever, for the Time it holds him in the shivering Fit; besides I have observ'd the Sweats have not smelt sour and fetid, until the second Day; therefore it ought to be call'd an irregular, or a depress'd Quartan.</P>
<P>It may be thought miraculous, that In∣termittent Fevers should go off, and re∣turn so regularly at stated Periods, when one might reasonably have suppos'd the Patient to have been quite freed from the Distemper by the Sweats, at the Termina∣tion of the last Fit.</P>
<P>Now I am of opinion, that the Body draws in the infectious Particles, from the sourness of the Sweats, back again; as soon as Nature has thrust out such Sweats;
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>so as I judge it in this Fever, the Body is capable of admitting in such Infection, as Nature at that time discharges through the Pores; so it returns again in as many Hours as it requires to reach the Animal Spirits, to cause a fresh Disturbance; and then the Nerves again show the Rigour and Antipathy, by shaking every Fibre and Muscle in the Body.</P>
<P>But let this be how it will, Intermit∣tent Fevers are so familiar to us, that the Cure is become very easy; the only Diffi∣culty is, when the Bark purges, which is commonly prevented by Opiates; yet the Stomach is manag'd much better with Preparations of Sulphur; for Opiates by thickening the Blood, and causing a slow∣ness of the Internal Motion, bring on very often the Rheumatism, a Dropsy, or some other Evil much harder to be cur'd, than the Intermittent Fever.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Small-Pox.</HEAD>
<P>WHenever the Small-Pox breaks out in any Part, it commonly takes a run through the whole Place, whether Town or City, and frequently several Vil∣lages near each other, for twelve Miles round.</P>
<P>The Confluent Sort is not a Degree milder than a Pestilential Fever, and is full as contagious among chose who have not had the Small-Pox before; neither is the Infection limited to the Small-Pox only; for frequently when the Fever comes to a Crisis, and the Pustules begin to di∣gest, the purulent Matter then diffuses out an offensive Smell, which will even infect those who have had the Small-Pox before; but as their Bodies are not liable to the Small-Pox, the Infection will be∣get a Fever full as bad, if not worse; and notwithstanding one's Body being incapa∣ble of admitting the very same sort of Fever, yet the Infection may produce a Fever of some other kind; so great is the
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>Affinity in Malignant and Pestilential Fe∣vers one towards another.</P>
<P>I can give one Instance of myself in particular, by lying in the same Bed with a Man who had a Quartan Ague; his Sweats were very sour and fetid, to which Smell I bore so great an Antipathy, that it in∣fected me, and had, as I thought, receiv'd an Intermittent Fever, until the Small-Pox came out to convince me to the con∣trary. I remember a Child in the same House had the Small-Pox, about ten Days after me; and this Distemper went no farther; so that it is plain the Constituti∣on of the Air was not fit at that time for an Infection of the Small-Pox, no more than my Body was in a Constitution to receive in an Intermittent Fever.</P>
<P>As I have compar'd the Small-Pox to Pestilential Fevers, we should regard eve∣ry Symptom in the same manner; for both bleeding and blistering ought to be us'd, when Nature is in danger of being overset, by the violent kecking in drawing the Breath; or likewise the Pain in the Head, and Neck, or other Symptoms be∣ing
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>too violent for Nature to find out her true Course for Freedom.</P>
<P>We ought never to force any thing upon the Patient that he has any dislike to, tho 'tis too common for the Nurse to urge the Patient to drink beyond his Thirst, either Tare Drink, or some particular Liquor which she has an opinion of; which fre∣quently brings on a vomiting, and a Loose∣ness, not by its Quality, but by the Quantity he drinks: For although a Liquid be astrin∣gent, if the Sick drink more than Nature can bear, it must purge it self off.</P>
<P>The Patient (as I said before in Pesti∣lential Fevers) must be diverted with such diluting Liquors, as best suits his Desire, in order to cherish Nature, that she may be able to do her Part; yet we have Me∣thods of relieving several bad Symptoms in the Small-Pox; but to set down what to apply when such a Symptom appears, and such a Medicine in such a kind of Disorder, a Man might write all his Life time, and his Work would be imperfect at last, and serve only to delude, rather than instruct; therefore an Eye of Judg∣ment
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>looking on the Patient in this and all other Diseases, will conduct Medicines more effectual, than any Rule set forth by the greatest Author in the World.</P>
<P>Before I conclude upon this Subject, I ought to consider how it comes to pass that the Small-Pox are favourable to young Children, when their Bodies are more li∣able to receive any kind of Hurt or In∣fection from the Air by that Tenderness in them; yet we must allow that they are not so much subject to either Sympa∣thy or Antipathy, neither have they any Dread or Apprehension of Death, until the Nurses begin to infect their tender Thoughts with Tales of frightful Ghosts; so that the Small-Pox is more favourable, if the Thoughts keep free from Malig∣nity and Dread; this is the best Reason I can give at present, but if Time and Practice introduce me hereafter to a better Knowledge in this, or any other Distem∣per, I shall be glad to publish it, since my Desire is to improve the Art of heal∣ing, as far as Providence has given me a Commission.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
<HEAD>Of the Measles.</HEAD>
<P>THE Measles proceed from a Raw∣ness or Heaviness in the Air, which clogs the Pores of the Body, and hinders Perspiration, and is more apt to afflict Children and young People, by reason of a greater Tenderness in them, than in Per∣sons that are in Years, whose Bodies are harden'd to all Alterations.</P>
<P>The Measles certainly is a Fever, al∣though it does not so readily shew itself by the Tokens common in other Fevers; yet if we examine strictly, we find it very nervous and violent by two Symptoms in particular; the first and most plain, is the Pain in the Optick Nerves, which pro∣duces a Discharge of sharp Humour out of the Eyes; and when it happens that the Patient hath not this Discharge, the Pain in the Head and behind the Eyes is more violent.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A Pain and Soreness in the Kidneys, with an Inflammation in all the Urinary Passages, whereby the Water is
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>in some measure suppress'd, and ting'd of a reddish Colour; and as one Evil begets another, so this Grief in the Kidneys and Urinary Vessels, causes that violent Sick∣ness which always ensues and commonly lasts about eight or ten Hours before it begins to abate then the Rash comes out; and for want of a free course of Urine, there commonly comes on a Looseness at the same time, so the Patient begins to find some Ease by intervals. Now the Symp∣toms go off by Degrees; only the Cough which began at first, continues, and may prove of ill Consequence, if not remov'd in time by proper means; such as Emul∣sions made with <HI>Sperma Ceti,</HI> to be drank frequently, and a Mucilage made of Quince Seeds, with some Nutmeg grated into it, and a little Sugar to make it agreeable, to be taken by a spoonful at a time, as often as the Cough is troublesome.</P>
<P>Let him take a Paper of Powder made of prepar'd Coral and <HI>Lac Sulphur,</HI> of each fifteen Grains, twice a Day in a quarter of a Pint of new Milk; these Medicines will answer the End if continued for ten
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>or fifteen Days, being made and apply'd as they ought, I mean by having a due regard to the Constitution of the Patient and the Symptoms of the Disorders; he may eat at the same time Broths, and any nourishing Meats in Moderation, such as his Fancy prompts him to; he may drink for his common Drink, Barley Water, and sometimes a Draught of Small Beer, if it is not too stale; for the Pectoral Decocti∣ons are of no service in this Cough, nei∣ther are the common Linctus's, made of Oils and Pectoral Syrups.</P>
<P>All heating Medicines are hurtful, from the beginning quite thro' the whole Course of the Disease; and the vain pretence of striking the Distemper out from the Heart, is without any Grounds of Reason or Con∣sideration.</P>
<P>The Patient must forbear all Spirituous Liquors, and Cordial Medicines, unless we find the Spirits very much reduc'd by Sweats and other Evacuations; and even then we should be very careful how we attempt to elevate, since most Medicines under the Denomination of Cordials, are
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>liable to encourage the Fever to run beyond its natural Measure; and it is by this means that a Hectick Fever, and a Consumptive Cough, so often follows the Measles and Fever of this Kind.</P>
<P>A Scarlet Fever is of the very same Na∣ture, and must be treated in the same man∣ner.</P>
<P>As the Rash and Measles are so apt to affect the Lungs, I will set forth the na∣ture of a Hectick Fever, Coughs, and Con∣sumptions in the following Chapter; keep∣ing close to Truth, which is the principal Virtue, and ought to be the Care of every Author in Physick.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Consumptions.</HEAD>
<P>COnsumptions which befal Young People, are always introduc'd by a Hectick Fever, wherein the Blood is too thin and spirituous, and partly of a Scor∣butick Quality.</P>
<P>If we duly consider that the Lungs are supply'd with Moisture no other way than
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>by what perspires out of the Diaphragma, and Pleura; it is not so wonderful that a sharpness in the Blood should afflict the Lungs with that continual hecking and tickling Cough: since it is plain that the Moisture within the Thorax must consist of the Serum, and the most thin Particles from the Blood; for both the Diaphrag∣ma and Pleura abound with Minute San∣guiferous Vessels; and as a Consumptive Cough is introduc'd by this Heat, or sharp∣ness in the Blood, so this Hectick Fever is caus'd by Victuals of too high Nourish∣ment, and Liquors too Rich and Strong for Persons whose Blood is apt to be too spirituous, being in their Youth and Vigour.</P>
<P>Some People, for want of a true Idea, will be apt to dispute this being the only Cause of a Hectick Fever; yet I am cer∣tain it is; though it so often comes at the Conclusion of other Fevers; it is not na∣tural to succeed any of 'em; but caus'd by the ill Measures aforesaid; neither is it difficult to cure, if the Patient can be regulated into a proper Regimen, such as Panada, Mutton-Broth, made without
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>Turnips; Rice in any form, Jelleys, Flu∣mery, Raw Milk, warm from the Cow, and all Things that are cooling and heal∣ing.</P>
<P>He musts abstain from Salt Meats, Rich Soops, and all Victuals of high Nourish∣ment; neither must he drink Wines, Spi∣rituous Drams, nor any kind of Cordials.</P>
<P>When the Patient will set a Resoluti∣on to diet himself in the foregoing Man∣ner, we may promise a Cure by the fol∣lowing Method.</P>
<P>First take away nine or ten Ounces of Blood; then let the Patient drink plen∣tifully of Emulsions made of the Cold Seeds, with ten Drops of the Balm of <HI>Gilead</HI> to every Quart; and let him take as often as the Cough troubles him, a spoonful of a Mucilage made of Quince Kernels, with some Nutmeg grated into it, and a little Sugar to make it agreeable, and no more, (for Sugar is apt to cause too quick a Fermentation in the Stomach.) Pearl Juleps are of singular use, being cooling and grateful; he may drink com∣mon Whey sometimes for a Change, it is
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>very proper, having in it an Emollient Quality; he may take a gentle Decocti∣on of Senna, and Rhubarb, to open his Body as often as there is occasion; for it is necessary to keep him rather Laxative, than Costive.</P>
<P>The Patient must use no violent Exer∣cise, nor give a Loose to Passions of the Mind; for all rash Motions or Thoughts of Revenge, and all sudden Surprizes, or Thoughts of Pleasure, will cause remissive Blushes in the Countenance, and sudden sharp Sweats, which remit and return, as often as those Passions affect him.</P>
<P>This is the true Nature of this kind of Consumption, which is (by the Vulgar) commonly called the galloping Consump∣tion; and indeed a very proper Name, if we consider that in this Distemper, Na∣ture is too much elevated, and running her Course unrein'd, falls flat before she makes out half her Length.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
<HEAD>Of the Phthisic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW it is to be noted, that Old People's Blood may be made too rich; yet not so apt to be spirituous and sharp, but rather heavy and clammy, there∣fore it produces in them the Phthisic, Asth∣ma, or some such kind of Disorder; where∣in the Lungs are overloaded with a tough Mucus, or Flegm.</P>
<P>In this Case all spirituous Liquors (drank in Moderation) are proper, and every thing that may quicken the Fermentation in the Stomach; for this is a slackness of Motion, as the former is a quickness; therefore riding, and all Brisk Exercises of the Body, are proper in this Case, as they are hurtful in the former; and as the other is from the Force of Eagerness and Rashness in Youth, this the Effect of Heaviness in Old Age; and although this sort of Consumption is not of so sharp a Nature, yet it is much harder to cure; notwithstanding the Patient may be very much reliev'd by expectorating Medicines;
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>even when he gasps for Breath, the Tubes in the Lungs being clog'd and contracted by the viscid Mucus or Flegm.</P>
<P>The best and most effectual Remedies are these following: A Linctus made of Oximel of Squills, Syrrup of Balsam and Linseed Oil, of each equal Quantities; let the Patient take a Spoonful every Morn∣ing; but when it happens that his Sto∣mach will not bear this Linctus, make up instead of it, a Mixture of Gum Am∣moniacum, two Drams, dissolv'd in six Ounces of Penny-Royal-Water; he must take three Spoonfuls of this Mixture every Morning; if it should purge him too much, let him take less in Quantity.</P>
<P>An Ounce of Tincture of <HI>Hiera Picra,</HI> with thirty Drops of Liquid <HI>Laudanum,</HI> to be taken every fourth Night going to Bed; Malt Drink is hurtful, because it is heavy and clogging, therefore I advise him to Punch made with Oranges, to drink moderately as his Spirits require it.</P>
<P>By this Means the Patient may be made so easy, or at least reliev'd so far, as he shall find very little inconveniency in it,
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>yet he may be afflicted with this Sort of Consumption (I mean the Phthisic and Asthma) above twenty Years; and even at last his Death may be imputed to Old Age.</P>
<P>In this Place it may be observ'd, that what Man soever would prolong his Course with Nature, this must be his Rule, depress her gently, as there is Occasion, in his youthful Years, and cherish her as he grows Old.</P>
<P>I wish I could set forth the Ideas I have of Consumptions in a fairer Light; yet it may be understood from what I have said, that every wheesing Cough is not a Consumption, nor every hecking or tickling Cough the Phthisic.</P>
<P>Thus the Virtue of a Physician con∣sists in judging exactly the Nature of the Distemper, and the Constitution of the Patient; and this was the Advantage that Doctor <HI>Radcliff</HI> had, in knowing his Maker, (I mean he judg'd Nature) better than other Men: So sprang his unpara∣lel'd Success.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
<HEAD>Of the Dropsy.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Physical Writers have erro∣neously drawn other Distempers to this Title, making three or four different Sorts of Dropsies.</P>
<P>I beg their Pardon for saying that no Distemper is a Dropsy, but an Overset of Water that presses against the Valves, and contracts the Passages which (by Nature) are design'd to receive or suck up that Water which is in the Abdomen, in or∣der to discharge it out of the Body.</P>
<P>A Tympany cannot be call'd a Dropsy, because it is Wind pent up without Mo∣tion,, so it is call'd <HI>Tympanum,</HI> or a Drum.</P>
<P>And what is call'd a Dropsy in the <HI>O∣varia,</HI> is a Hurt by Coition, when the Textures or Animalculas of the Seed are broken or imperfect, which being receiv'd, embrac'd, and retain'd in the <HI>Orchis,</HI> draws to it the <HI>Mucus</HI> or nourishment, which attends and flows to the Parts of Gene∣ration in a natural and vital Conception.
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>Now this Mucilaginous Matter concoct∣ed by vital Warmth, becomes hard and tough; it increases in bigness, and grows every Day more hard to cure.</P>
<P>When we meet with any one under this Misfortune, we must depress Nature by Rough Medicines, which are cold and revulsive, in order to give a sudden Shock to the Parts of Generation; for all warm∣ing Medicines are hurtful in this Disease, because the Warmth of Nature glutinates all slimy Matter to a Toughness, as a Coldness of Nature reduces it to a Soft∣ness or a Fluidity.</P>
<P>Thus a False Conception resembles a Natural one; yet although this Resem∣blance between a Dropsy, a Tympany, and a Conception, may deceive the Eye, it ought not to deceive the Understand∣ing.</P>
<P>Therefore a real Dropsy is, when the <HI>Viscera</HI> and all the Urinary Vessels are stun'd and obstructed, which the Patient feels by a Heaviness and Numbness in the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> and all the lower Part of the Body; the Bowels are relax'd, and the
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>Peristaltick Motion very slow; by this Slowness of the Internal Motion, and Weakness in the Bowels and Urinary Ves∣sels; the Water in the Cavity of the Belly has no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its Motion nor Freedom, to pass out of the Body; so it causes first the Belly to swell, and the Legs soon after, by the Weight of this watery Humour pressing downwards. And the shortness of Breath which always attends this Distemper, is caus'd by the Cavity of the Belly being so fill'd with Water, that it presses against the the Diaphragma or Midriff; thus it con∣tracts or straitens the Chest or Thorax, which contains the Heart and Lights, so that this Pressure that the Water makes against the Midriff, hinders the Chest from expanding, and the Lungs from dilating sufficiently for Respiration.</P>
<P>I may (with a good Assurance) object against the common Proceedings in this Disease; since both Reason and Practice will defend me.</P>
<P>The Common Method is rough Ca∣tharticks and Emeticks; such as Turbiths Mineral, Panacea of Antimony, Gambo-Elebor,
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>Elaterium, and such like Me∣dicines, which by Repetition, relax and tear those Vessels that are already weaken'd with the Disease: Thus the Pa∣tient is reduc'd into such a wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Condi∣tion, that it will be past the Art of Man to restore him; notwithstanding he is flatter'd at first, and thinks himself some∣thing better, when his Stomach and Bow∣els are emptied by the aforesaid Evacua∣tions: Thus the Physician and the Patient are both deceiv'd, for want of knowing that every rough Purge and straining Vo∣mit weakens the Peristaltick Motion, and benumbs the <HI>Viscera,</HI> and all the Uri∣nary Vessels that are design'd to suck up the Water, when there is more in the Belly, than the necessary Quantity.</P>
<P>Now it is worth the Physician's While to consider that the Bowels swim in this Water; the Water is not in the Bowels, therefore if we aim at a perfect Cure, we must use Diureticks, and restorative Medicines; for as soon as the <HI>Viscera</HI> and Urinary Vessels recover their Strength, and the Bowels the Warmth and natural Mo∣tion,
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>the usual Passages will then be ca∣pable of receiving the Water, and dis∣charging it out, both by Urine and Stool.</P>
<P>I do not want to conceal any thing, that might be depended upon, to render my Works more useful for the Health and Preservation of Mankind; although there are some particular Medicines which I have found successful, and know to be infallible, if duly administred, and the Patient at the same time rightly ma∣naged; but so various are the Constitu∣tions of Human Bodies, and so particu∣lar are their Tempers, that if a Medi∣cine does not suit with their Ways of thinking, they can hardly be persuaded to take it; and even then they will not repeat it, because it does not take away the Swelling all of a sudden, as a Wo∣man, at her full Time with Child, is de∣liver'd of her Big-belly by a Midwife.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
<HEAD>Of the Stone and Gravel.</HEAD>
<P>MOST Jellys, or mucilaginous Matter, fix'd, or lying in any part of the Body without motion, by vital Heat becomes hard or tough; and, in time, turns to Bone or Stone.</P>
<P>So the Stone (being bred of Slime, which fixes itself in the Urinary Vessels) is more subject to Children, than grown Persons; whose Bodies are by Nature stronger, and more liable to cast off by Evacuation, that sort of slimy Matter, which petrifies by lying in the urinary Vessels without motion.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Gravel is more apt to af∣flict grown People; for, as Time turns most hard things to dust; so the Stone, as it grows ripe, begins to canker and crumble to Sand and Gravel, which causes Pain as it passes out through the Ure∣thra; therefore it is a great Mistake, to think that the Gravel breeds the Stone; for it is the Stone that produces the Gra∣vel.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
<P>We must be very cautious in giving Diureticks; for by their forcing Quality the Patient is very much tormented.</P>
<P>A Decoction of Mallows, Emulsions, and all oily Medicines, are necessary, by mollifying and healing the Fibres in the urinary Passages: But no Medicine can be more effectual, when the Pain is vio∣lent, than a Turpentine Glyster; which gives Ease by its unctuous and healing Quality. Thus, as often as the sharpness of the Disease returns, the Patient may be made tolerable easy; until Time crum∣ble the Stone into Particles, small enough to come away without much Pain.</P>
<P>It ought to be consider'd, that People in Years are apt to have Inflammations, and Sorenesses in the Bladder and <HI>Pelvis,</HI> which are frequently mistaken for the Stone.</P>
<P>Manna taken once in ten Days, is an exceeding good Medicine for any Sore∣ness or Ulcer in the Bladder or Kidneys; and is also very proper, even in the Stone and Gravel, by preventing any Inflamma∣tion in the Kidneys: For Manna being
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>opening and cooling, gently carries off all corrosive Humours from those Parts.</P>
<P>As I was objecting against forcing Re∣medies, I will further say, that when we attempt to force Nature, we commonly obstruct her, as is demonstrable to any skilful. Practitioner: yet with Care the Stone may, in a great measure, be caus'd to crumble to Pieces.</P>
<P>I once thought myself Master of this Knack of dissolving the Stone (as I call'd it) having had surprising Success in three different Children, who were about five or six Years old; which puff'd me up with Vanity; until I was call'd to a Child of Mr. <HI>West</HI>'s, a Carpenter, in <HI>Swan Yard,</HI> in the <HI>Strand:</HI> I was then very young and giddy headed; assur'd 'em I could dissolve the Stone, and bring it away. Here I was disappointed; the Child's Pain increased so much, that they sent to an∣other, who had recourse to his Knife; and I was laugh'd at, and despis'd; and perhaps it was better it happen'd so: For had I succeeded here, I should have been more obstinate in my Practice, be∣yond
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>Reason: Since this, I never would attempt to break the Stone in the Blad∣der. Though, I confefs, if I had a Child of my own afflicted with it, I would use all Means, before he should receive that Hurt by Lithotomy, which they scarce ever perfectly recover.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Pox.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Disease has certainly been for Time out of mind, although it has shown itself of late Years in sharper Symptoms, by reason of eating great quan∣tities of Sugar, and foreign Sweets, which create a corrosive Quality in the Fluids; and I really believe it was this Distem∣per, that in old Times was call'd the Plague of a Leprosy, and the hoary Ul∣cer; and was thought to be occasioned by the Men cohabiting with their Wo∣men in the time of Natural Purgations; and to prevent these kind of Disorders, or Uncleannesses, the Elders made very
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>strict Laws to restrain the People at such Times. But if they had restrained every Man to one Woman only, and likewise every Woman to one Man only, it would then have had the desir'd Effect; for the Pox was caus'd then, as it may now, by Excess; (for excess of any thing is Poison,) I mean Excess in Venery; when one Woman admits, or is compell'd to receive the Seeds of several Men one immediately after another, though they are all sound Men, and the Woman like∣wise sound and well, yet the variety of Seeds thus fermenting within the Ma∣trix, will inflame and corrode the Parts of Generation.</P>
<P>I need not set down the nature of a fresh Clap, because it is done by so many before; nor the Method of Cure, since People, for the sake of saving their Mo∣ney, will apply to any Apprentice, or Quack, who plies 'em off with rough Medicines, and puts even themselves to six times the Expence that is necessary, and the Patient, to sixty times the Incon∣veniency. For there are some Symptoms,
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>at the first beginning, which are very sharp and dangerous, and prove of fatal Consequence, if not manag'd with both Care and Judgment.</P>
<P>I have not had a great deal of Prac∣tice in Venereal Cases, yet I have met with some particular Disorders which may be worth mentioning; such as stub∣born <HI>Gonorrhaeas;</HI> a continual pain, or rather a Tenderness upon the Bone of the Nose; a Flux of sharp Humour from the Ears; an Ulcer in the Throat, or <HI>Uvula,</HI> and such like Disorders: which I have met with in Persons whose Consti∣tutions have in a manner been worn out, by repeating Mercurial Medicines so often, that at last they would neither purge nor salivate, by reason of the Glands being stunn'd, and the <HI>Mucus</HI> and natu∣ral Moisture exhausted.</P>
<P>In such like Cases the Cure consists in warming restorative Medicines; the Pa∣tient, at the same time, must stick to a nourishing Diet, in order to cherish and strengthen Nature; for as the Glands re∣cover their true Tone, and the Fluids
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>their vital Spirit, the mercurial Medi∣cines, which lie dormant, will then be∣gin to work their Effect, either by a con∣tinual Purging, or a gentle Salivation. This is what I can affirm from Expe∣cience, which is a Proof beyond Reason itself.</P>
<P>I would not have the World mistake me, to think that I am exclaiming a∣gainst Mercury; for I find it the most effectual, and the easiest Method of Cure; and indeed the safest, if it is manag'd rightly. And that Hoarseness, or Dis∣order upon the Lungs, which so fre∣quently ensues a Salivation, proceeds not from the Mercury, but from some Mis∣management, either in their Diet, or im∣proper Medicines given upon Mercury, under pretence of taking off the Sali∣vation: For Mercury is seldom mended by other Medicines, it is frequently made worse. Neither does the Virtue of Diet∣drinks consist in the Quality of the In∣gredients, but in the Quantity the Pa∣tient drinks. For suppose there should remain a corrosive Quality in the Body
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>after flu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing; whether hot Water is not as good an Antidote as a Decoction of the Woods? All that can be said, it is not so agreeable and warming to the Stomach.</P>
<P>But however I am convinc'd that Mer∣cury, if honestly prepar'd, leaves no Poi∣son behind it, if the Physician will let it work off in its own easy Manner; yet as the Lungs are refin'd by a Salivation, they become very tender, and liable to be hurt by all Cordial Medicines or Wines, and any Spirituous Liquors: There is not half so much Danger of taking Cold as is sup∣pos'd; for if I was to salivate a Person at the Hazard of my own Life, I would keep him no hotter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han he himself found agreeable.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Gout.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JUVENIS Voluptate abundans edit potatque; Senectute autem invadente, vigor naturalis evanescet, multis occupatur∣que moeroribus.</HI></P>
<P>So the Gout proceeds from Indulgencies
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>we give ourselves up to, when we find a Slackness of Desire; for then we begin to fear a Decay; and with vain Hopes of prompting ourselves to our former Gaiety and Vigour, drink Wines and Spirituous Liquors, without a Natural Thirst or real Desire, and eat Loads of Rich Victuals, without the true Rule of Appetite.</P>
<P>Thus, by overloading the Stomach, the Fibres and Pores or Passages, by which the Nourishment steams or perspires out of the Stomach into the Lacteals, are re∣lax'd or dilated; so that the Nourishment which is drawn into the Lacteals, is too heavy, and of a crude and clammy Qua∣lity; which Distemper being communi∣cated to the Blood, irregulates the Moti∣on of the Artery and the Nerve; for there is a Nerve lies close along with every Ar∣tery, and at every Pulsation of Blood from the Heart, these Nerves give a Jirk (for a better Expression I may call it a recep∣tive or an assistive Motion) which draws along the Pulsation of Blood by the same Motion at the same Moment into every Artery in the Body; for notwithstanding the Motion of the Heart being very forci∣ble,
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>it could not drive the Blood with that Quickness into the extreme Parts at every Systole, if it was not assisted by the Nerve in the Manner I have describ'd.</P>
<P>Now the Blood being heavy and clam∣my, cannot circulate back again by the Veins quick enough to receive the Blood from the Artery; and when an Artery is thus obstructed, the Pulsations come by Pushes, or Thrusts, striving for Freedom, yet the Nerve keeps it's true Motion; and this Irregularity of Time and Motion be∣tween the Nerve and the Artery, tears some of the fine Membranes which brace 'em together.</P>
<P>Now those Membranes being tore by the aforesaid Pushes, or Thrusts, cause that violent Pain, and produce a kind of Jel∣ly, which by lying in a continual Heat, grows Hard, so that in time it will re∣semble Chalk Stones, which I confess is very surprising; yet an Egg Shell is more like Chalk, being form'd of a Natural Matter and a necessary Heat, as the Gout Stones are form'd of false Matter, and Supernatural Heat.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
<P>I am very certain that the Gout may be cur'd where the Patient will regulate his Life, and conquer himself to a proper Diet.</P>
<P>I might make a long Discourse on the Particulars, from the Experience I have had, having been afflicted with it myself before I was two and thirty Years Old: I confess I am partly ashamed, as I impute the Gout to the aforesaid Causes, yet I may tell it with some Pride, the Conquest I have made in being entirely free from any Symptom of it now.</P>
<P>But I can hardly believe any one will restrain himself with so much Resoluti∣on as I did, therefore I need not set down the Method I took with myself, only ad∣vise the Patient never to eat above a Quarter of a Pound of Solid Victuals at one Meal, although that Quantity may be eaten every three Hours; neither must he drink above a Quarter of a Pint of Liquor at one Draught, yet he may drink as often as Desire prompts him, so that his Liquor be not too strong, nor stale, but rather new and upon the Ferment; for
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>new working Small Beer, and even parch'd Peas are very proper, likewise all windy Things whatsoever that may in any Mea∣sure quicken Motion and Circulation; perhaps some Persons may object against windy Things, for fear of the Cholick, yet it is without Reason; for the Cho∣lick cannot be cur'd without things that ferment in the Stomach, and quicken the Peristaltick Motion.</P>
<P>In the Gout it is necessary that the Pa∣tient should drink plentifully, so his Li∣quors are proper; for it is a kind of Fe∣ver, as we find when we are awak'd out of our Sleep with the Pain, and a rigorous Disorder in the Nerves throughout the whole Body; yet it is not safe to attempt a Cure by the aforesaid Method, nor any ways to depress Nature, until the violence of the Fit goes off; therefore Strong Wines and all warming Bitters are pro∣per to defend the Stomach, while the Patient has the Fit upon him; yet a strong Decoction of Camomile Flowers drank hot every Night going to Bed, is prefer∣able
<PB N="62" REF="61"/>to Snake Root, or any other Bitter whatsoever.</P>
<P>I am not guilty of fancying one parti∣cular Medicine Universal, or fit to be given in all Distempers; yet I will recom∣mend the Elixir of Vipers in the Gout; it may be given even in the violence of the Fit; it secures the Stomach by cre∣ating an inward Briskness and Thirst; for a Thirst is a very good Symptom in the Gout, as a devouring Appetite is a bad one, before the Fit comes on.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable how the Patient eats with a prodigious Greediness a Day or two before the Fit begins, but not with a Natural Hunger, nor Pleasure; for when a Man who is very hungry sits down calm∣ly to a Dish of Soop, or some such thing half digested, he may feel in three or four Minutes a Sweetness and Delight flow to each Breast, as the Nourishment steams out of the Stomach into the Lacteal Vessels; and when a Person debars himself from eating longer than ordinary, Nature then calls in the <HI>Mucus</HI> from all the Glands, and the Moisture in the Muscles from
<PB N="63" REF="62" MS="y"/>all the extreme Parts, to support the Heart and Spirit that Motion may not cease; but still this Suction of Nature will reach farther; for if a Man was to be quite debar'd from eating and drinking, his Life might be preserv'd considerably long∣er by a nourishing Poultice made of Bread moisten'd with Wine and Gravy, and ap∣ply'd to each Breast, for the Breasts are most capable of communicating a Nou∣rishment to cherish and support the Ani∣mal Spirits, because there is no Muscle or fleshy Substance outwardly, that has so near a Communication to the Heart and Stomach; <HI>here I make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stop.</HI></P>
<P>With some Doubt and Discourage∣ment I am reflecting on my own Works; been telling a Friend, a Man in Practice, that I have spent a few Hours in writing the Natural Causes and Steps to the Cure of several Distempers, who gave me a despisable Sneer, and told me that a great many Fools are publish'd of late, and are as much asham'd of themselves, when they come to see their Thoughts in Print, as they were in love with their Works whilst
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>in Manuscripts: Besides, says he, can a giddy headed young Fellow of five and thirty be capable of Matters in Physick, which ought to be from Thoughts most solid and sublime?</P>
<P>I confess the Spirit that leads me is self-Opinion, and I believe no Man writes without it, and the stronger this Spirit is in any Author, the more valuable are his Works, if there be but the Weight of Rea∣son in his Thoughts; and the Thoughts of several valuable and sublime Things are lost, for want of being comprehend∣ed and encouraged.</P>
<P>Thus I recover myself again from that Reflection of Youth and Vanity, with an Assurance that if a Man be ever capable of doing Wonders, it must be while he is in his Prime; before heavy Days come, when his Senses grow slack and imper∣fect; for then his Sight, his Taste, and Smell deceive him.</P>
<P>Suppose a Man whose Sight is decay∣ing, was to give a Description of a Can∣dle burning about six Yards from him; how must he describe it to us? Must he
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>say there's a Circle round it, or Streams of Light, or some such Imperfection which he sees, though he's sure it is not in the Candle, but in his Sense of Sight; how is he sure? Because he remembers the Candle burnt perfect when his Sight was clear. But the Disorders in the Eyes, I shall preserve among some practical Ob∣servations and Experiments in Anatomy, which if I had a full Authority, I should be glad to publish, with the Causes of several other Chronical Diseases: For my Design is to set down the real Causes of Distempers, and ill Proceedings in seve∣ral remarkable Cases, whereby many bad Symptoms in several Diseases may be shun'd easier than cur'd; yet Wonders may be done in all Distempers by a skil∣ful Physician, and a careful Nurse, where the Patient complies with Rules necessa∣ry for his Disorder.</P>
<P>I cannot believe it the Will of the Al∣mighty, that a Man shall be snatch'd away before he has run his due Course with Nature.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
<P>For certainly, when there is a Concep∣tion, it ought to come to a Natural Birth, at a Natural Time; and after a Child is born, (if it is not hurt nor hinder'd) it must grow to a Natural Strength, and the Course of Life to be of a Natural Length; there∣fore Diseases are always caus'd by some Hurt or ill Rules of Life.</P>
<P>People cannot die in their Youth, un∣less Nature be depress'd, or overset; Na∣ture may be depress'd even to Death by Hunger, Coldness, or Loss of Blood; and She may be overset by Dread, or Surprize, violent Motion, or excessive Eating and Drinking: How often do we find Nurses destroy Young Children by Strong Li∣quors, or stuffing 'em to such a Degree, that Nature is overset, and they are seiz'd with Convulsions, and die.</P>
<P>Yet it may be necessary sometimes to curb, or rather depress Nature; at other times it may be necessary to cherish, or rather prompt her; so the Course of Life may in some Measure be prolong'd by Management and Care.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
<P>But I am very sensible that Nature will change, and Life must come towards a Period; for as Desire abates, we then be∣gin to bow down our Faces with Care against the Earth, to see that we tread our Steps in Safety; and when the Marks of Age are carried in the Face of Man, he lies down to rest in Grief, slumbering, in his Fancy hears the Bird o' th' Night, starts up in Fear of that which is on High; While thus he listens, his Ears, and all the Gates are open, until his Thoughts are overset with Dread, then the Harmony ceases, because the Strings of Musick are slack; thus, the Garison is given up to the great Conqueror, and the Soul to God that gave it.</P>
