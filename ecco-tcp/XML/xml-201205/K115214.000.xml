<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE best Preface, in my Mind, that can be made to this Book is, a Quotation out of itself, p. 59. where the Author, as in a Sort of Corollary, drawn from his own Reflections, says:</P>
<P><Q>"From the Reflections that have been hitherto made, it may be ga∣ther'd, that 'tis by no Means, an indifferent Matter in Practice, to
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>adopt indifferently, the System of the Rupture of the Vessels, or that of the Intrusion of the Blood into the lymphatick Canals: It is of the highest Consequence, to chuse either the one or the other, to list on one Side or the other, and to appear more than ordinarily engaged or concern'd therein. If the Dispute here was only about some insipid, barren Point of Speculation, amu∣sing perhaps to the Curious, but altogether useless, and without In∣fluence on Practice, those who regard Things only as they are use∣ful, might perhaps slumber over
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>it: But as our Business is here about a capital Point, which affects and concerns Practice to the highest Degree; since in the two Hypo∣theses the Manner of Cure is quite different; this ought to awake the Attention of all Practitioners, inspire them with an extraordinary Relish for the present Subject, and rouze them totally out of their Indifference."</Q></P>
<P>And this should, indeed, rouze out of their Indifference, not only all Gentlemen of the Faculty, but even, methinks, should tempt all Gentle∣men, who are (as all Gentlemen
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>should be) Men of Learning, to study this Point, on purpose to con∣cern themselves in this Controversy, as it regards the Well-being of the Fair Sex, the lovely Fountain whence, under Heaven, we all have our Being; Women! to promote whose Health and Happiness, the Man that is not ambitious, is a Monster! the Object of all Mankind's just Detestation!</P>

<HEAD>CRITICAL REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>OMEN are subject to such regular Evacuations, that 'tis very hard to account for, and assign the Cause there∣of. Some have been of Opi∣nion, that Nature, by this Flux, propos'd to purge the Blood of the Sex from the Impurities it contracts, thereby to render them more fruitful. Others, by observing the Quali∣ties of the Blood which Women in Health <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose in their Courses, have been persuaded, that 'tis so far from being an Excrement, or Mass of Filth, that, on the contrary, it is a most pure Blood, and of Consequence, very fit and proper to nourish the <HI>Foetus.</HI> So much for the Final Cause, or End, for which these Flowings seem ordain'd.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<P>As for the Efficient Cause, the moving, or mechanick Principle, which, in the Fe∣male Body produces these Effects, Men do not agree much better about this, than about the Final Cause, and are not much less divided in their Opinions, as to the Manner in which this Evacuation is made, than they are concerning the End, the Mo∣tives and Design, which Nature may have in procuring it.</P>
<P>Some Authors, much devoted to Astro∣culture, and accustomed to trample under Foot such immediate Causes as they have just at Hand, Objects that are too plain, fa∣miliar, palpable, and natural for them to look upon but with Contempt, as Things common, ordinary, trivial; these Men erect the Moon for the efficient Cause, and make her absolute Mistress of the Courses in Que∣stion. Others, somewhat more indulgent, and better disposed towards sublunary Cau∣ses, have taken Care to make Cavities in the Womb, where they lodge in Ambuscade a certain Ferment, or Leaven, which they have order'd to sally regularly thence every Month, to attack the Blood in its Passage, put the Humours all in Combustion, disturb the Harmony of the Motions, the Exact∣ness of the Functions, and, in fine, to play the little Devil, that, full of Malice, bent upon Mutiny, and breathing nought but wild Sedition, is never at Rest, nor lays down his Arms, till he has rais'd in the
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>Blood a tumultuous Agitation, a disorderly Effervescence, a more than ordinary Fer∣mentation, and laid under Fire and Gore all the Region of the <HI>Matrix,</HI> which he makes a Field of Battle, that is, for some Days, to be quite overflown with Blood, and as the Object of his Rage, to appear alto∣gether dismal, and in Disorder. They who judge in the most simple, and most natural Way, and, of course, the nearest to Truth, are those who, after the famous <HI>Galen,</HI> ac∣knowledge for Cause and Mover of this Flowing, the <HI>Plethora,</HI> or Abundance of Blood, among whom, we must confess, that Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Physician, has most distinguish'd himself, in a Treatise he has publish'd upon this Subject; which, tho' it be not exempt from Mistakes (as we shall observe in the Sequel of this) is, however, in the main, a valuable Piece, both for the singular Clearness that shines every where throughout the Performance (which makes its principal Merit) and for the great Num∣ber of very excellent Reasonings, and es∣sential Observations, that we see there dis∣play'd in the fairest Light. If one will but vouchsafe to stoop a little, to seek for Cau∣ses in the sublunary Empire, and not to be over-smitten with the Charms of the Moon, and dazzled with her mighty Power; in fine, if we'll be impartial Judges, we shall easily side with <HI>Galen,</HI> and without Hesita∣tion, give to the System of the <HI>Plethora</HI>

<PB N="4" REF="11"/>(which has since been so illustrated by Dr. <HI>Freind</HI>) the Justice due to it, and the Preference it deserves.</P>
<P>Women, in their Courses, do but dis∣charge their Superfluity; and, to be con∣vinc'd of this, it is enough to observe, that after they have had these Flowings long enough, for Instance, the Space of Five Years, they are no ways disorder'd thereby, but, on the contrary, they continue always alike, hold the very same State, enjoy the same Vigour, and, if you weigh 'em, you'll find 'em no lighter; and yet, in this Time, they have lost a Hundred Pound of purest Blood; as Loss! that should not only weaken them, but consume almost their whole Substance, and reduce them to no∣thing, were it any thing else but Superflui∣ty. Now, if Women have this Redundan∣cy of Blood, this is what we call the <HI>Plethora,</HI> and the Matter we are seeking. There is therefore this <HI>Plethora,</HI> or Redun∣dancy of Blood in Women; that is prov'd: But how, and by what Means is this <HI>Ple∣thora</HI> contracted in the Persons of the Sex? This is what we now must unfold in two or three Words; <HI>Women transpire less than Men;</HI> which is prov'd by four Reflections: 1st. Their Bodies are more weak and ten∣der; the Parts thereof less robust; the Texture of the Fibres more fine and soft, and less proper for oscillatory Motions; and, in fine, less vigorous; witness their gentle
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>and languishing Pulse; which shews us plain, that the peaceable Blood, moving easy in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Course, and slowly rowling through the drowsy Vessels, runs not rapidly to the Glands, neither towards the Skin, nor else∣where; so that the Secretion of the Hu∣mours cannot very much be promoted: Add to this, that the Juices, separated in the Strainers, are not in Haste to issue; because the secreting Pipes have not a systaltick Virtue strong enough to squeeze 'em thro', <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd drive 'em forth with Precipitation. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dly.</HI> The Vessels in Women are of a straiter Orifice. Now, as the Secretion of Humours is more or less abundant, according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Strainers are bigger or smaller, and the Blood more or less animated, it follows of Course, that, the Motion of the Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing less strong at the same time that the Pipes or Organs of Secretion are more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>treight in the Woman, the Secretion of the Humours must be perform'd more slowly. <HI>3dly.</HI> Women are of a moist Temperament, as plainly appears by the Suppleness and Softness of their Skin; now, if the Fibres are so soak'd in Humidity, 'tis because they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave not Vigour enough to rid themselves of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; for that Body must be dry which expels with Force the Juices that come into it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd discharges a great Part of its Moisture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Transpiration, which is the more abun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant in Proportion as the Oscillation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Vessels is the more vigorous. <HI>4thly.</HI> The
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>Fair Sex is not so active, has not so much Exercise; they lead an idle, indolent, se∣dentary Life, which does not much excite Transpiration: 'Tis true, we see some Wo∣men robust, and ingag'd in hard Labour These, because they are as strong as Men and have a manly Complection and Cha∣racter, are call'd Virago's; and such are ex∣empted from the usual Courses of Women We have also seen Women-Singers an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dancers exempted from these. But here may be objected what Dr. <HI>Andry</HI> advance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his excellent Thesis upon Exercise, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Womens frequent Tattle may supply the Want of other Bodily Labour; and, per∣haps, hence it comes, that Women, chat∣tering much more than Men, have less Oc∣casion for other Excercise. We must ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Transpiration is assisted by the Motion of the Voice in Conversation; yet these Moti∣ons are not so considerable, as not to leave sufficient Matter for Womens Courses. Thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is the <HI>Plethora</HI> bred in the Sex; whenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nature is obliged to prepare a Discharge for the superfluous Blood, whose Sally, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> several Reasons, is thro' the Womb; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this is the Part where the Blood more plen∣tifully issues, because of the great Number of Blood-Vessels, which, being wound and interwoven together, spread all over and through the Substance, in a Thousand Warps and Turnings, after a serpentine Manner; and that which the more conveys
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>the Blood this Way, is the Trunk of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>escending <HI>Aorta,</HI> which is remarkably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rger in Women than in Men, to the End <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat, the Blood flowing more abundantly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ownwards, the <HI>Foetus</HI> may thereby be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter nourished, and the easier thrust out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Muscles in Time of Child-Birth. Now, as much Propension as the Blood has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> descend towards the <HI>Matrix,</HI> so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as it the greater Difficulty to return from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence; for thither it tends, through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rteries, which jirk it pretty fast along, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the more readily, as the Blood of itself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y its own Weight, concurs to the Motion: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut it returns through the Veins, which have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot the like Force to shove it, besides the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sisting Clog of its own Weight, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey have to conquer; so that 'tis always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Disposition to recoil, suspended as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Vessels which labour to make it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se; and which, to increase the Difficul∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, have not so much as a Place of Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rve, to sustain it in its March; and don't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pply it with Suckers to facilitate its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inful Journey. For this also is a Point to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> observ'd, that the Veins of the Womb <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave no Valves; so that the Blood has a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal of Difficulty to gather in this <HI>Viscus;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, of Consequence, has the like Difficulty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pass through the Conduits that there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rminate. Here it is that I am obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffer in Opinion with Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Manner of explaining this Passage; he
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>pretends, that, to make way for the Blood to escape, the Arteries must break in their Extremities, that is, towards these Parts where they take the Name of <HI>Capillaries;</HI> he undertakes to prove this Rupture by Principles deduced from the Mathematicks whence he draws Conclusions for his Purpose and, in the Manner he goes about it, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems to reason very securely, and to ad¦vance nothing but what seems infallible an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> undoubted; and his Argument has all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Air of a Demonstration, victorious and un¦exceptionable. A Geometrician, who was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prove, that all the Angles of a Triangle ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> equal to two Right ones, and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tangent touches the Circle but in on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Point, would not go more boldly about i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor with more Confidence. At the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Time, the Doctor's Demonstration is fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Geometrical; and the Geometrica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Certainty will, perhaps, be rather found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Side. He advances two Proposition establish'd by Mathematicians: <HI>1st.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Force of a Body increases, as it acquir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> either more Bulk, or more Swiftness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both together, <HI>2dly.</HI> If the Force of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Body is superior to that of the Obstac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which it encounters, this Obstacle will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> surmounted. Whence he concludes, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Force of the Blood augments in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Plethora,</HI> because there is together, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> once, both more Bulk and more Velocity more Bulk, because the <HI>Plethora</HI> consists
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>abundance of Blood; more Velocity, be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause, says he, as there is abundance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood, provided it be not slow and viscous, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t emits the greater Quantity of Spirits, which flow to the Heart and the Arteries, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he more briskly to animate them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edouble their Contractions. Now, the Vessels are to be consider'd as Obstacles that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inder the. Blood from extravasing; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch they continue to be, whilst they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uperior or equal in Force to the Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey contain within them; but, when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to be over-power'd, and the Strength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Blood is increas'd to that Degree, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to conquer their Resistance, they straight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield, are readily broken, and open a free <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assage through the Breaches of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unicks. Now, the Vessels the easiest and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttest to yield, are those of the Womb; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich, being the most attack'd, are least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to make Resistance; and to compre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end perfectly well how they give way, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds only to take Notice, that the <HI>Ple∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hora,</HI> at the same Time it augments the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce of the Blood, weakens the Resistance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Vessels; for, says Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> in con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equence of the big Volume of Blood that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eighs upon the Veins and Arteries, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly on their Sides, but perpendicular, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecause of the winding Disposition of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essels, which, by their Turnings and Counter-turnings, in their Folds and Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olds, expose their Angles and Corners to
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>the direct and perpendicular Impulse of the Fluid: By Means, I say, of this big Volume of Blood, the Vessels are stretch'd and dilated, and thereby the Fibres that compose these Vessels leave an Opening be∣twixt 'em; so that their Texture being less close and firm, and more press'd upon, they are more dispos'd to separate, and yield to the Attack of the Blood, if it just so hap∣pens, that when they are at their weakest, the Blood has more Force than ordinary, as it truly has; since the <HI>Plethora</HI> gives it more Strength, as we have prov'd, both by Reason of the Blood's greater Bulk and greater Velocity: The Blood therefore will take the Advantage of the Vessels disad∣vantageous Situation, which, being violent∣ly stretch'd, widen'd, and press'd, lose a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great deal of their Resistance, and can offer but a weak Bar against the impetuous Force and Impulse of the Blood. Wherefore, the Barrier being surmounted, because the Fi∣bres of the Vessels being widen'd, and but weakly helping each other, nor able to make any great Struggle against thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Disunion, there is but little to hinder the Fluid from breaking its Prison, from tearing their Canals, and extravasing; the more easily, as these winding Canals, that make a Thousand Circumvolutions, are more ex∣pos'd to the Strokes of the Blood, being be¦sides destitute of the Muscles and the Fat to uphold, maintain and defend 'em against the
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>Rupture: They must therefore yield to the Impulse of the Blood, and be broken to give it way to escape.</P>
<P>This is the Explication of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> and one can't help agreeing with him in this Part of it, that the <HI>Plethora</HI> contributes much to the Monthly Courses; at the same Time we must also own, that notwithstand∣ing all these Advantages which we have just now attributed to the Blood, yet it ought to be contain'd in a just Measure, and restrain'd to certain Bounds. We must con∣fess with <HI>Etmuller</HI> and <HI>Riverius,</HI> that an excessive <HI>Plethora</HI> is more likely to suppress, than to excite the Courses; nay, we may further assert, that this is the most usual, and almost the general Cause of these Sup∣pressions that afflict the Sex. The two fa∣mous Physicians, we have just now quoted, account for these Suppressions by the ex∣cessive Redundance of Blood, which they make the Cause thereof, much in the same Manner as we impute the Stoppage of Urine to the too great Quantity of Liquor gather∣ed in the Bladder; which Anology is judi∣cious enough; 'tis true, it is not exact, it runs not upon all Four; because (according to the Remark of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> who refutes it) the Bladder is much better furnish'd than the Blood-Vessels are, being fortified with a Tunick firm and fleshy, too strong to be torn and broken by the Affluence of Urine, which coming there to lodge but in
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>a slow, indolent Manner, without any Im∣petuosity, is not able to make any great Havock there; all that it does in this Case, is so to stretch the Fibres of the Bladder, that they cannot come to themselves again, and have not Freedom enough to contract in order to expel the Urine. That which also contributes a great deal to the Stop∣page is, that the <HI>Sphincter</HI> of the Bladder, to wit, the Muscle that stops the Passage thereof, has, in this Case, all the Advan∣tage, and remains Master of the Field of Battle, because its Antagonist, namely, the Muscular Tunick, which serves to drive out the Urine, being stretch'd, dilated, constrain'd and hinder'd, has not Strength enough to counterbalance the <HI>Sphincter,</HI> much less to over-power it. In this respect, I shall believe the Parallel betwixt the two Stoppages to be imperfect; but 'tis just at least in this, that it compares a Blood, which issues not from the Vessels, because, oppressing them by its Weight, it leaves them not Play enough to expel it; I say, as it compares this Blood to the Urine that remains in the Bladder, because being there too abundant, it so dilates the Bladder, that it cannot contract to drive it out. On both Sides we see a super-abundant Fluid; a Solid groaning under the Oppressi∣on of this Super-abundance; and on both Sides is observ'd a Canal or Reservior, choak'd with its Liquor, which it is forc'd
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>to retain, because it is depriv'd of the Means to discharge it; inasmuch as this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iquor, by its excessive Quantity, triumphs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver the Spring of the moving Fibres, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich, by being more stretch'd, lose all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir Power and Play.

<P>This mechanical Account, is it not more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sy, more simple, more plain and satisfactory? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d does it not more Honour to Nature, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e System of the Rupture of the Vessels? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a constant Maxim with Philosophers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at Nature does every thing by Ways the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost simple, and least expensive. Now, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k, on which of these two Sides it costs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e most? In the first Place, does it not
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>impair the Vessels much more, by making them so often to suffer a Solution of their Continuity? Is not this Hurt done to the Substance in its solid Parts too dear a Pur∣chase? and the frequent tearing of the vas∣cular Tunicks, which must every Month be broken, is not this paying too great a Price for the Exit of this Portion of superfluou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> troublesome Blood? But by the other Way how will it cost so dear? Only a little En∣largement of the Bounds of the lymphatic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Arteries, a little Straining of their Diame∣ter, which is far from making such Havoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as this Rupture does, yet, at once, does al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Business. But let us carry this Point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little further. Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> pretends to de∣monstrate how the <HI>Plethora</HI> procures th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Flux. He has Recourse to the Force <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Blood, which over-powers the For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Vessels; and, to establish in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blood this Superiority, he says, that the Blood encreases in its Mass and Velocity while the Resistance of the Vessels dimi∣nishes; because their Fibres being stretch and widen'd, are thereby depriv'd of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> strict Union and Connection, in which con∣sists their Force. The Author admits i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Blood a considerable Velocity, and ad∣vances, at the same Time, that the Vesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are stretch'd and restrain'd as if the Swift∣ness of the Blood did not proceed, from its being so briskly jerk'd, beaten and push forward, by the powerful Oscillation of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>Vessels, which being stretch'd and restrain'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re not able to push the Fluid with so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igour; whence it necessarily follows, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Fluid must lose of its Velocity, instead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f gaining more, as the Author pretends. Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> would have avoided this Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>exity, had he taken Care to observe the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oving Force of the Blood, and had ex∣lain'd himself a little more particularly up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it. Rejecting, as he does, the Hypothe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Fermentation, it is to be presum'd he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bscribes to the Oscillation of the Solids, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Truth he seems to hint in several Parts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his Book. Now, this System makes the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gitation, or progressive Motion of the Flu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, to depend upon the systaltick Virtue of he Solid, whose Spring being more or less <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimated, makes the Blood and all the Hu∣nours move with more or less Precipitation. This is a Principle which we think cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e denied by Dr. <HI>Freind;</HI> and yet this Prin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iple makes against himself, because thence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> follows, that in Proportion as the Vessels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose of their Ease and Liberty, the Blood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar from taking the Advantage of their Weakness, to attack and break them, as it does in the Sense of this Author, does it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf abate of its Impulse, and consequently of its Force, and so shares in the Feebleness of the Vessels, instead of triumphing over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. This carries us yet farther.</P>
<P>This Swiftness of the Fluid being a pure Effect of the strong Vibration of the Solid,
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>which at once both contains and chases it, is not a Portion of the Force of the Blood, but of the Force of the Vessels, which, without doubt, are strong enough to defend themselves against the Irruption and Insult of a Humour that has no other Arms than what they vouchsafe to lend it, and which would remain dormant, lazy, languishing, if the Vessels were not so kind as to put it in Motion. Here now, pray what has the Blood to boast of, poor and beggarly in it self! What has it, which it hath not re∣ceiv'd? And if it has receiv'd all it hath, wherewith can it prevail? How can it have the Infolence to employ its Strength against those that gave it, and turn its Arms to the Disadvantage of those that arm'd it? Hence we may plainly see, that the Blood having no Assistance but what it borrows, cannot thence take any Advantage against the Ves∣sels; so that there only remains its own Mass whence it can draw any Succour. But here visibly falls our Author's Demonstrati∣on; for the Force of the Stroke, or of the Percussion, being infinitely greater than any Pressure, as he himself says after <HI>Borelli, Vis actûs omni pressione infinitò major est;</HI> and the Percussion being the Effect of the Velocity, which 'tis confess'd does not pro∣ceed from the Blood's own Force, it conse∣quently follows, that the Blood, to break the Vessels, wants just that which is the most proper and conducive to this Effect; so
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>that the Force of the Percussion failing, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood has no more Force, than from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ressure of its own Mass; and this, 'tis al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow'd, is not so powerful by far as the Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ussion. Whence, after all, one may judge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at <HI>Borelli</HI>'s Proposition is false in one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ense, and in the present Case may be de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed; for the Blood swiftly mov'd attacks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Vessels, and yet it is prov'd, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce of the Attack is less than that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essure; because the Pressure comes from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Mass, and the Mass is properly that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich belongs to the Fluid: It is its own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oper Force, and it can do more with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Addition of one Degree of Mass, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith that of twenty extraordinary Degrees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Swiftness; the Reason whereof is evi∣ent. 'Tis, for that by its additional De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree of Mass, it weakens the Vessel, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idening its Fibres, and rendering them less <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le to withstand their Dis-union, which it ever can do by its Swiftness, suppose it aug∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented to what Degree you please.

<P>Every morbifick Suppression, says our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Author, which depends upon the Fault <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Vessels, or of the Blood, offers two
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>Indications; the one to open the Canals that are obstructed and stopp'd; the other to correct and reduce the Blood: The Fault of the Canals, continues he, is either to grow hard and stiff by a natural Dryness, or to be contracted by a sudden Coldness, in such wise, that they oppose the Impulse o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Blood, and resist their being broken. To remove this Impediment, according to the Opinion of this Illustrious Physician, we must relaxe the Fibres; but there is an Equi∣vocation in this <HI>Relaxe,</HI> which 'tis wort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> while to clear up; we usually understan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Laxity or Relaxation, a State opposite to Tension, a State where the Fibres are supple and not stretch'd, where they a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> freely, and without Restraint; because being sufficiently moisten'd, they are flexibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and pliant; whereas Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> seems t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> understand by Laxity, the State of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bres widen'd, pull'd, and stretch'd into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strong Distention: So, according to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Idea, the more the Canals are swell'd wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Abundance of the Liquid, the more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fibres will be widened one from another and the more they will be relaxed; whenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it follows, that, to effect the Relaxation taken in this Sense, and on the present Hy∣pothesis to make the <HI>Menses</HI> flow, the sure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Means is to draw into the Pipes as muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as one can, wherewith to swell, obstruc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stuff and clog them.

The Laxity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat I first mention'd, taken in the natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd ordinary Meaning of the Word, is quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifferent from this; and, on the System of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> as much contrary to the Month∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Courses, as the other is favourable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem; the one is procured by the Supple∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess and Flexibility, the other by the Force, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Torture, the Pulling and Stretching of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Fibres: Wherefore, if it be proper, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rder to make the Courses flow, that the Fibres should be pull'd, stretch'd, widen'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd forc'd, nothing can be more adverse and opposite to this Flowing, than this State is, where the Fibres are supple, flexible, pli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant, at their Ease, their own Masters, un∣restrain'd, no way suffering, no way mo∣lested. This pre-suppos'd, we are going to see which of these two Relaxations Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> proposes to us as the Subject of our Consideration; and we shall observe, upon this Occasion, that he does not too well, here, agree with himself; for, as these two Relaxations are incompatible, to admit the one, is excluding the other; tho' Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> seems as if he would chime in with both. For this End, saith he, name∣ly, to conquer the Resistance of the Vessels, and to procure the Relaxation of the Fi∣bres, we must apply exterior Remedies moderately warm, such as Fumigations,
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>Baths, and Fomentations, prepar'd with emollient and penetrating Herbs: <HI>Ad hunc finem tepidé adhibentur externa Remedia, qualia sunt Suffitus, Balnea, Fomenta, ex∣herbis emollientibus, &amp; penetrantibus con∣flata.</HI> This is proper to procure that Sort of Relaxation which consists in the Supple∣ness and Flexibility of the Fibres, but not the other, which consists in the stretching, widening, and constraining them, to render them less able to resist the Impulse of the Fluid: <HI>Contractu autem vasorum inhibito, vasorum later a laxiùs explicantur, &amp; fluido impingenti debilius resistunt.</HI> If one has a Mind to break the Vessels, methinks 'tis going the wrong Way about it, to make them supple, pliant, tractable, yielding; for the more flexible and yielding they are, the less they are dispos'd to be broken; the more supple, sure the lefs frangible; a dry Cord will sooner break than a moist one; and if Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> will be pleased to take a little Notice of this, he will observe, that a dry and hard Vessel is more frail and easy to be broke than a pliant, soften'd, moisten'd one; what View then can this able Physici∣an have? and what Indication leads him to relaxe the Vessels, by Emollients, such as Baths, Fumigations, Fomentations? I here appeal to the Judgment of this excellent Author himself, so well vers'd as he is in Mechanicks, perhaps I am dazzled with a false Light myself; yet, till I am enlight∣ned,
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>I shall always imagine, that the Blood in its Motion will sooner break Vessels hard and dry, which make Head against it, are directly expos'd to the full Strength of its Impulse, to the Force of its Collisions, more within the Reach of its Sallies, more the Mark of its Impetuosity, and of its fiercest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd briskest Attacks, than Vessels softened, which, by their yielding Suppleness, dex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erously avoid all the Thrusts the Blood can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake against them; as we see the pliant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds elude the Attack of the most out∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ageous Tempests, whilst Oaks that stand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll butt against them, and stiffly sustain the Assault, lye rooted up, and prostrate upon the Ground, the illustrious Victims, and the magnificent Trophies of the furious Tempest's Power. The Cold-too that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iffens the Fibres seems also to render them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he more frail, and liable to break. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing so, who does not see that Desiccatives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere are much more proper than Emollients? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho does not here see, that instead of soften∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the Vessels that are too dry and hard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d slackening the Fibres that are too stiff, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e must maintain them in their Dryness and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iffness, and far from diminishing any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these, we must augment them as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we can; because we shall infallibly ren∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r the Vessels and Fibres more frail, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oportion as we shall render them more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y and stiff; the more Violence we do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em, the more Stress and Torture we put
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>them to. Emollients, in this Case, seem quite contrary to our Purpose, because they seem more proper to make the Conduits play, by setting them at their Ease, than to make them yield to such a Rupture as our illustrious Author desires. <HI>Hippocra∣tes</HI> he observes, in a Suppression of the Courses, advises to begin with a Purga∣tion by Fomentations; <HI>suppressis mensibus fomenta purgationi esse praemittenda mone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hippocrates:</HI> But if the Purgation operate in the same Manner as they say the Fluxe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do, by the Rupture of the Vessels, the Us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Fomentations, far from being serviceabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here, would be hurtful; but as it is confess'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the Purge don't work in this Manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but by quite different Ways; to say tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Fomentation is useful here, is at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same time to say, that it is not prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for the Fluxes, which differ so much fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Purgation: We foment before Purgation to make the excretory Ducts more yielding and more disposed to emit their Juices, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they may the better hearken to the Instig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion of a Purgative, and be the more e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣caciously persuaded to do what we wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have them: This is our Drift in Foment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tions, and this does not drive at breaking tearing and disjoining the Fibres, but tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to sooth, temper, refresh and supple the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to give the Juices we design to discharge, free, easy, natural Passage thro' the Issue the Pipes destin'd for that Purpose.

The Blood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter first Bleeding, tho' still abundant enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o vex, irritate, and stretch 'em, yet is no more able to over-power and conquer 'em. Mean while, the Bleeding, having set the Blood in Motion, will in a little time abate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Sallies, and restrain its Frolicks. The Resistance of the Fluids, that maintains the Solids in their unbridled Oscillations, in proportion as it diminishes, will calm and reduce them to their natural Vibrations; the Fury of the Vessels will abate in pro∣portion as the Mass of the Blood diminish∣es, because, by how much the Bulk of the Blood is lessened, by so much less Oppositi∣on will the Vessels feel; the less, of course, will they be excited to furious Motions, and the more disposed to recover their usu∣al Course, their ordinary Oscillations, their natural Motions: Then, as the Blood con∣tracts its Slowness from its excessive Abun∣dance,
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>the Bleeding diminishing this, shews us how much it contributes to correct the Slowness of the Blood. This being pre-sup∣posed, one would think the Doctor should favour this Remedy, and one would not imagine, how, in consequence of his Prin∣ciples, he could advance, that in the Begin∣ning of a Disease, the Blood being too slow, it should not be proper to let Blood, unless there be Reason to hope, that thereby the Viscidity of the Blood may be corrected; and even tho' there should be an Appearance of this, yet ought not Bleeding to be cho∣sen, if any other Method can be thought of, to restore the Blood to its Velocity, without lessening its Volume. But what is strangely surprizing is, to see such a Man as Dr. <HI>Friend,</HI> in whom sound Judgment takes Place so much of Prejudice, giving into vul∣gar Notions and Fancies without Foundation▪ He has Regard to the Weakness of the Per∣sons who suffer in these Stoppages, which does not proceed from Inanition, but Over-Repletion; not from a Scarcity, but from a Stock of Forces stow'd in too narrow Com∣pass, which only want to be set at large, as they are by Bleeding; a Weakness how∣ever, from which a Pretence is drawn, to save that Blood, which wants to be dimi∣nished, in order to exert its hidden Force, that is quite stifled by its own Redundancy; a Weakness whence a Counter-Indication is drawn against Bleeding, to cure it, to make
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>its unactive, dissembling Force exert and de∣clare itself. Women, they usually say, are so weak in these Suppressions, that they cannot bear Bleeding, which causes such a prompt and brisk Revolution in the Hu∣mours: Is not this Language altogether vulgar? 'Tis what the common Sort of Peo∣ple usually say thro' Prepossession, rather than Reflection. Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> also says, <HI>Neque <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oc sané praetermitti debet, quod in iis qui∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us supperssi sunt menses, it a ferè vires im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ninutae sint, ut sanguinis missionem, à quâ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deo expedita inducitur humorum mutatio, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ninùs sustinere queant.</HI> At this rate, Ple∣thoricks should not be let Blood; for the <HI>Plethora</HI> takes away their Strength; and we see that the more Blood they have, the weaker they are. But this Notion was too unworthy of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> for him to fix for any time upon it; so 'tis not long before he goes off from it; Bleeding happens to fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto Disgrace; but a few Lines lower, it again recovers its Credit, and in the very same Case where it underwent the Disgrace. Sometimes, however, says our Author, the Blood gives certain Symptoms of its State and Constitution, which, carefully consi∣der'd, oblige to open a Vein, and to open it too with Success. One of these Sym∣ptoms may be a Pulse full and weak, which is sometimes observed in the Beginning of a Distemper; nothing but Good can come of Bleeding upon this Occasion; for thence
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>results a greater Velocity, and, of Conse∣quence, in the Opinion of Dr. <HI>Friend,</HI> the greater Force of the Blood. <HI>Nonnunquam tamen sanguis ea de se praebet indicia, qui∣bus siquis diligentùs studuerit, venam haud inauspicatò poterit secare: talis indicii ex∣emplum sit pulsus plenus &amp; imbecillis, qui morbo nondum inveterato aliquando observa∣tur; itaque ad hunc modum constituto pul∣sus venae sectio, si adhibita sit, sanguis mo∣mentum intendet.</HI> Since a full and weak Pulse allows, and even obliges to bleed, the Weakness of People afflicted with these Suppressions, is not therefore a good Rea∣son to forbear Bleeding; for, with a full and weak Pulse, as our Author observes, and which, in his Opinion, prescribes Phlebotomy, Women cannot but be weak: It is not the Weakness then that forbids Bleeding. The Reason Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> adds to authorize the Precaution he advises, in order to diminish the Blood, is not very sure; he says, that when the Arteries are so full, that the Tunicks are stretch'd, and take up a greater Space, 'tis a Sign that the Humours are not yet thickened; for, if their Mass was considerably thick and sizy in its Texture, it would take up less Room, because its Particles would be less close, and the Arteries thereby less stretch'd. This is however, what a Body cannot trust to, because the Mass of Humours, close thicken'd and condens'd, may happen to be
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>in such Abundance, as to stretch the Tu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icks to a considerable Dilatation, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bating the Velocity of the Humours, whose Redundance is no way incompatible with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir extreme Condensation. So that, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Arteries taking up no great Space, there; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s no concluding, that the Fluid they con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain is very massive; for it may be massive, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompact, and close in its Texture, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame time that it is ample, large, and ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended in its Volume. A little Attention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere will shew there is no Repugnance in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his. A little further, the Author says, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he vascular Tunicks, unbent by the Bleed∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, less resisting the Blood that strikes upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, the Force of the Stroke is thereby weakened: <HI>Tunicis sanguini affluenti mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ùs renitentibus deficit ictûs magnitudo.</HI> At this rate, 'tis ill done to bleed, since it weakens the Force of the Blow, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <HI>Freind</HI> makes the principal Promoter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Fluxes. The Business therefore is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o slacken the Tunicks, nor to render them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upple and pliant, but, on the contrary, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tretch them all we can, and to render them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiff, dry, and hard; for Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> agrees, that in this State they make the most Resi∣stance. Now, according to his Account in his 4th Mathematical Proposition,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. 5.</NOTE> the Mo∣tion lost (that is communicated) is propor∣tioned to the Resistance; <HI>motus deperditus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st ut resistentia;</HI> but the Force of the
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>Strokes is also measured by the Motion lost: <HI>In percutientibus corporibus ictuum magni∣tudo motui deperdito proportionalis est.</HI> Then, as there is most Resistance made by the Fibres stretch'd, stiff, dry, and hard, the Blood that strikes upon 'em loses still the more of its Motion, since the Motion lost is answerable to the Resistance made: There∣fore the Force of the Stroke is the greater in these Fibres; since the Force of the Strokes are suitable to the Quantity of the Motion lost. Therefore, in fine, these Sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Fibres must sooner crack, than Fibre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that are supple, slack, and flexible.

Wherefore, all the Power and Ad∣vantage is here on the Side of the Blood Now, if the Force of a Body surmount the Force of the Obstacle it has to encoun∣ter, this Obstacle must give way, according to the second Proposition: <HI>Si momentu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> corporis sit majus quam contraria impedi∣menti vis, id impedimentum removebitur</HI> the Vessels, in this Case, must be broken and cannot hinder the Blood from extravas∣ing. Upon these Principles, settled by Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> himself, methinks, I may, with out the Imputation of too much Presumpti∣on, on, defy him to explain the Suppression o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Fluxes by an excessive <HI>Plethora,</HI> and by the Dryness and Hardness of the Vessels
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>which make too great a Resistance; for all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his wonderfully contributes to the Flux, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s I think has been heretofore sufficiently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emonstrated. Our Author is inclin'd to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Opinion, that Bleeding should be us'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather after than before the Purgatives and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmenagogues, which are the Remedies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore especially design'd to promote the re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ular Courses.

<P>Before we pass on to an Article so im∣portant, as to inquire of the Place where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is fit to bleed, whether it be in the Arm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Foot; I desire it may be call'd t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mind, that the Swiftness of the Blood is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> principal Foundation of our Author's System and yet we have prov'd it to be a ruino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Foundation; since the Blood cannot app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the Disadvantage and Prejudice of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vessels, a Strength it receives from them and a Velocity for which it is obliged t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them: So that the Doctrine of our Autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is, in that Point alone, sapp'd from the ve∣ry Foundation. This is what I desire ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be well remember'd, once for all; for have no Inclination to be troublesome, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repeating it so often over; <HI>Lindanus
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>Etmuller</HI> counsels, at the Approach of the Courses, to bleed in the Arm; whereas in the actual Course, already begun, he sends you to bleed in the Foot; which he never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rders to be done, but in a Course either actually flowing, or suddenly stopp'd: And <HI>Etmuller</HI> accounts for this Doctrine in the following Manner.</P>
<P>Upon the Approach of the <HI>Menses,</HI> the Blood being abundant and swell'd, Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xerts all her Efforts to precipitate it to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower Parts; but the Conduits being small, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annot, on a sudden, yield and open so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on; on the contrary, being stretch'd and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onstrain'd, they refuse a Passage to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood; because they are not at Freedom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o contract themselves, and make way for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Blood. In this Circumstance, if you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leed at the Foot, you draw the Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ownwards, you charge the <HI>Matrix</HI> more, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou add Clog upon Clog, and raise the Di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emper to the highest Degree. On the con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rary, bleed in the Arm, you divert the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood from the Parts that are opprest there∣with; you facilitate its Course, you clear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ways through which it is to pass; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou give the Conduits the Suppleness they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant to issue forth the Blood they convey; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the Bleeding at the Foot will never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovoke the Terms, unless they be actu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly flowing, or by a sudden Cold, or seiz∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Fright, have their Course interrupted. This way of Reasoning Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> can no
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>wise relish; it has something in it that is strange and shocking to him. Here it is suppos'd, says he, that the Blood is so swell'd and rarified, that it might easily flow thro'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Vessels, if, when 'tis carried downwards, the Plenitude it contracts did not form an Obstacle to its Discharge; that the Vessels, the more they are gorg'd with Blood, are less in a Condition to yield to the Torrent. He rejects this; finds it contrary to Medi∣cal Philosophy, and even inconsistent with common Sense. But is this Reproach well grounded? and have not we a Right to make it recoil upon its Author? <HI>Etmuller</HI> is here accus'd not to have common Sense<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> This Accusation, if it be found unjust, will it not rebound upon Dr. <HI>Freind?</HI> Shall we have more Respect for him than he has for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one of the greatest Masters in Physick? The <HI>English</HI> Physician is so pre-possess'd with his own Opinion, and so glew'dd, as it were to his own System, that he considers n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other's; and takes no Pains to enter into the Sentiments of the <HI>German</HI> Physician. There is a System which is satisfy'd to make the Vessels yield or burst to give way to the <HI>Menses;</HI> according to this Idea, it is natu∣ral and reasonable, that the more the Ves∣sels are swell'd and distended by the Blood the more fit they are to yield and to be broken: But have we not observ'd, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> himself falls into the same Ab∣surdity, which he reprimands in <HI>Etmuller</HI>

At the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame Time this System, which we have just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow seen, is not the only one; there is ano∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her which does not make the Vessels yield, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, on the contrary, makes them act to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovoke the Terms.

Our Author will have it, that, if the Bleeding in the Foot provokes the Terms that flow, or that are stopp'd in Flowing, it would also recal them, when suppress'd, from their Flux, tho' of a long Standing. This Consequence is not just;
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>but why, says he, in the first Case, does this Bleeding augment the Force of the Blood, in hurrying it downwards, and does not augment it in the second Case, acting still in the same Manner? The Question is not here about the Force of the Blood: <HI>Etmuller</HI> is not obliged to speak in Conse∣quence to the Principles of Dr. <HI>Freind;</HI> and Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> is but ill warranted to measure every thing by his own Ideas, and suit eve∣ry thing to his own Hypothesis, To do this, he first must prove, that the only way to be taken is that which he has taken; and that his is the only System that can ratio∣nally be follow'd: He ought first to have made it impregnable, and not have left such a Hold to be laid on't as he has done; since this System, according to what appears in our Remarks, is by so many Ways so suc∣cessfully shaken.</P>
<P>The Bleeding in the Foot excites the Terms that flow, and that are interrupted in flowing; because then the sole Business is to assist the Blood's Determination towards the Uterine Region; the Blood flows; this is a Sign that it is clear'd, refin'd, well-con∣dition'd; and that the Vessels are not em∣barass'd; now, the Passages, the Issues, the Conduits being free, and clear'd, the new Blood which the Bleeding in the Foot de∣termines that way, will easily pass, and without Pain, proceed to its Exit. The Blood that just now flow'd, ceases, and flows
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>no more. In this Case, it is only repell'd; only its Determination happens to be alter'd by some unlucky Accident; and you must recal the Blood to its Determination down∣wards. Here you have nothing to conquer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Repercussion wrought, either, for Example, by a stopping Cold, or by a seiz∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Fright; and this the Bleeding in the Foot does; it determines the Blood towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Matrix,</HI> and restores it to its former Tendency: But a Suppression of a long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tanding, being caus'd by the Congestion and Stoppage of the Blood in the Uterine Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illaries, our Business is not here about its Tendency towards the Vessels, but about its Discharge and Enlargement from the Ves∣sels themselves: The Matter is not now to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttract the Blood downwards, but to clear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way that which is already there, and which is there but in too great a Quantity; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince it is this very Quantity itself that ren∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers it there so very clogging and trouble∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome. Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> agrees, that the Bleed∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng in the Arm practis'd in such a Case, withdrawing a Portion of the Blood towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he superior Parts, the Conduits of the Womb are thereby in Truth reliev'd; but, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays he, the Diminution of the <HI>Plethora</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bating the Impetuosity of the Blood, the Vessels are not so dispos'd to break, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Vessels are less extended. This is ano∣ther irregular Reason, which supposes we can't take from the Abundance of the Li∣quid,
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>without abating aught of its Velocity; which is directly contrary to what the Author owns himself, a little before, in these Words: <HI>Igitur triduò anté, consultum perioditempus, secatur vena, ut tum praecipué novus sanguini accrescat impetus, cum aug∣menti summam attigerit Plethora.</HI> What Stress can we lay, after this, upon the De∣cisions of Dr. <HI>Freind?</HI> What can we reckon upon? To what Principle shall we adhere? The Sentiment of <HI>Etmuller</HI> is confirm'd by a famous Observation of <HI>Riverius</HI> upon a Woman whose Terms always stopp'd as often as she was blooded in the Foot, and very largely flow'd when she was blooded in the Arm: This Phaenomenon agrees but little with the ordinary Ideas of Physicians The Doctors of <HI>Montpellier</HI> have explain'd it by a Mechanism very well contriv'd, but incompatible with the System of our Au∣thor; whom one may defy, with all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Efforts and vast Capacity, to account for this Fact, related in the Second History o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the First Century of <HI>Riverius</HI>'s Observati∣ons. This Woman, say the Doctors, being Plethorick, and attack'd with a Suppression, caus'd by the prodigious Mass of the Blood, which dilated the Vessels of the <HI>Matrix</HI> to such a Degree, that they could not suffici∣ently use their contracting Power; when, by bleeding in the Foot, the Blood was deter∣min'd towards those Parts which were al∣ready over-charg'd therewith, the Clog
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>was augmented; and Occasion given to an obstinate Suppression; but when, by bleed∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng in the Arm, the Blood was invited to the superior Parts, the Vessels of the <HI>Uterus</HI> were disengag'd: Now, their Plenitude and Distention being diminished, they could con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ract and play with more Ease, and so pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure the natural and periodical Evacuation, which is made thro' Issues of the <HI>Matrix.</HI> Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> intrenches himself in this Sub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erfuge, which is in a Distinction he makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etwixt a <HI>Plethora,</HI> which he calls solita∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and that which is join'd with a <HI>Lentor;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd he says, 'tis only in this that the Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aution of <HI>Lindanus,</HI> noted in <HI>Etmuller,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes Place. He adds, that the Woman, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f whom <HI>Riverius</HI> speaks, was troubled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith this Sort of <HI>Plethora;</HI> and upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ottom he approves the Indication which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Montpellier</HI> Doctors have taken, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubscribes to their Practice. The Author <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen grows a little more mild towards <HI>Lindanus,</HI> and declares, that what is rela∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by <HI>Etmuller</HI> takes Place in one Case; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is therefore in the wrong, to cry out so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard against it, and pronounce, without Ground, that there is not common Sense in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Reasoning of that Author. Here he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould make Reparation to his Honour: He agrees, that, in Suppressions, one bleeds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst in the Arm, and then in the Foot; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssigns for a Reason of this, that the bleed∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng in the Arm augments the Velocity of
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>the Blood, and bleeding in the Foot aug∣ments the <HI>Plethora,</HI> in regard to the ute∣rine Vessels. But is this what he said at first? Might not one prove by his own Prin∣ciples, that the Consent he gives to this Practice is not very rational? Let us call to Mind what Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> hath said; does not common Sense require, that the more the Vessels are swell'd, the more they are sup∣pos'd to yield, crack and break? <HI>Ne com∣munis quidem sensus ferret, vasa quò magis sanguine distenta sint, eo minùs esse ad ce∣dendum facilia.</HI> Now, in the Plethorick Woman we are talking of, when she is blooded in the Foot, this augments the Swelling of the uterine Conduits, which are thereby more disposed to break, and give way; yet the Doctors of <HI>Montpellier</HI> caused the Woman to be blooded in the Arm and, by this Bleeding, one will say with Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> it is true, that the uterine Pas∣sages are clear'd of their Stoppage and Op∣pression; but as the Impetuosity of the Blood languishes by the Diminution of the <HI>Ple∣thora,</HI> the Vessels are render'd less liable to break, because they are then less extended <HI>Sectâ Brachii venâ, cum nonnihil sursu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> revellitur, liberantur quidem ab oppression<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> viae uterinae, sed impetu ob Plethoram im∣minutam languente, haud ita facile dissili unt vasa, quia minùs sunt distenta.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Slowness and the Viscidity of the Blood is according to our Author, a Reason not t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>bleed; and Bleeding does no good in Sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ressions, save when the Particles of the Blood are enough disengaged, and not very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enacious; because then they easily shift <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Place, and are perswaded to what he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls <HI>Dimotion.</HI> Now, he agrees, that the Blood of the Woman we talk of was vis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous, slow, and tenacious; how then, on his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rinciples, can he allow her to be blooded? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne has only to compare what he has ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anced with the Explications he now gives, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Occasion of this Woman, to see that all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on't agree, and that the System which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffered to us, as incontestable, and as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst Principle avow'd by every body, is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell supported. I should have a great many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore Remarks to make upon it, but I con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e myself to this precise Reflection, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay furnish many more: If the Flowing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Menses</HI> could be wrought by the Rup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of the Vessels, it would be more parti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>larly done when the Vessels were the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>angible; now, the Vessels are most frail, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen they are the most extended; but they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the most extended, when they; are the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost gorg'd with Blood; and they are more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>org'd with Blood, by bleeding in the Foot, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an by bleeding in the Arm; therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeding in the Foot stuffs them more with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood, stretches them more, and makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em more frangible. Then, as bleeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Foot renders the Uterine Vessels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore frail, and more ready to be broken,
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>it should, in the Woman we are speaking of, provoke the monthly Flux. If this Flux is wrought by the Breaking of the vascular Tunicks, the Blood is excessively abundant, it has all that it can want to prevail; the Vessels on their Part are dilated and stretch'd to the last Degree; so here is all that's want∣ing to conquer them; the, what hinder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them from being broken? and since the bleeding of the Foot, in stretching them disposes them more than ever to burst, is i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not evident, that it favours, and ought eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessarily to produce the Flux, if thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must be explain'd by the Rupture of the Ves∣sels? I omit several Irregularities, to finis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Discussion with two Words of Observa∣tion upon some Histories of Fact, relate by our Author, concerning Suppression. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first History is of a Girl Eighteen Years old yet without her Terms, who complain'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a great Pain in her Loins, Knees, and An∣cles; she had Difficulty in breathing, Squea∣mishness, and Gripes; her Heart, upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> least Exercise, panted; her Complexion wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lively and florid; her Pulse weak an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> slow; she was very much afflicted with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Symptoms for about Six Months: Dr. <HI>Frein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> did not find here any Indication for Bleed∣ing, he only propos'd to break and refin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Attenuants, the viscous Texture of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blood.</P>
<P>But is it not a wise Precaution, when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vessels are too much stretch'd, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>Blood too thick, sizy and stiff, to unbend the Vessels; and to diminish the Volume of the Blood, in order to facilitate the Action of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncisive Remedies, that they may lay more Hold upon the massive Humours? Is it not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isquing a great deal to undertake to rarify <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Blood which we don't diminish in the Vessels, whose Sides we cannot further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tretch, and all whose Space the Blood, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Thickness, now takes up? Where then will be Space for it in its Rarefaction? But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his is the Means, one will say, to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Uterine Capillaries crack; but this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lso the Means to burst other Vessels too: This Practice makes us justly fear the Rup∣ture of other important Vessels, and of con∣sequence terrible Hemorrhages. Besides, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s enough, if we consult the Motions of Phy∣sick, to perswade us, that a Mass of Juices, thick, gross, glewy and compact, resists too much the Action of Attenuants, and the Virtue of Incisives, for them to be able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay hold of, penetrate, and thrust themselves thereinto: They can do no more in this Case, but shove, struggle, and rummage in this Mass, instead of insinuating nicely into the Pores, wriggling subtilly, and without Noise, into the Interior of the Substance, so to separate with as much Efficacy, as little Disturbance, the Particles thereof. Bleeding, which is preparative to the Use of <HI>Opium,</HI> and which the most secures us in it, as has been clearly proved in the judicious Re∣flections
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>that have been made thereupon, should, for the same Reasons, be a Prepa∣rative for Emmenagogues, and secure their Success.</P>
<P>Bleeding then might have been apply'd in curing the sick Person in Question; every thing seem'd to indicate this, and, above all, the Difficulty of breathing, the Palpitation of the Heart, and the ruddy Colour of the Face; but the Obstruction which appear'd in the Region of the <HI>Matrix,</HI> whither the Blood had flow'd with too much Precipitati∣on, and where it had contracted a powerful and well-knit Body, requir'd the Bleeding to be not in the Foot, but in the Arm; therefore it seems, that had the Patient been bled in the Arm, one might have thereby freed the lower Parts, that were gorg'd, and, as it were, suffocated; and, by un-corking them, one might have engag'd them to yield readily to the desired Evacuation. Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> however, declares, that he did not think fit to employ this Remedy, by reason of the Weakness of the Girl, and because he apprehended, by this means, he might diminish, instead of augmenting the Blood: But these are Conjectures too weak and light to divert from the Use of a Re∣medy indicated, in other respects, by such pressing Motives; the Weakness, above all, is not in itself, as we have already shewn, a good Reason to omit Bleeding. Our Au∣thor, in his third Observation, gives us the
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>History of a Washer-woman, of a sanguine Complexion, about Twenty Four Years old, who, in washing with her Terms upon her, was seiz'd with a Fit of Coldness; she was also washing her Legs with cold Water; wherefore, the Flux having been here re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell'd by the Cold, her Terms disappeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or a Year, without any great apparent Consequence. Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> accounts, by her great Fatigue and Labours, for the little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rejudice this seem'd to do her Health: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, about the End of the Year, she felt a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery considerable Change; such as, a great Heaviness and Weakness, the Action of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tomach infeebled, the Function disorder'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pain in almost all her Limbs, a Cough, a Difficulty of Breathing, a Paleness, a Swel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of her Legs, where so hard a Tumor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red, that it was impossible, by any Plaster <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Cataplasm, to soften it, or to bring it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Suppuration; and her Pulse became fee∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, and languishing.

<PB N="54" REF="63"/>the Interruption of the Flux, wou'd perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have had better Success, in regard to the Source of the Suppression which seems to require this Bleeding, and which we the more readily believe, as the Blood shews no Appearance of gathering, slakening and Congestion, in the Uterine Conduits; and if it don't flow that way, this seems to be net so much through any Clog or Impedi∣ment that might be there contracted, as for want of its being determined towards those Parts. And what justifies this Thought o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mine is, the Remark it self of Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> who explains how the Suppression might have been so long a Time inoffensive, by the great Exercise of the Washer-woman which did not allow much Time for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blood to sojourn, stagnate, corrupt, and stick in the Uterine Region, so tost an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> jumbled as it was, and by Consequence re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣der'd more transpirable by the Woman Agitation.

When, says he, after <HI>Bellini,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. 11.</NOTE> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eady Removal of the Blood follows after bleeding, or when the Blood is so rarified, that its Particles are dis-unitedy and easily divided one from another, this Liquor ac∣quires a Velocity that fortifies its Power, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecause the animal Spirits, enlarg'd and free, flow to the Heart in a chearful Abun∣dance, and the Blood, broken and subtiliz'd, makes less Resistance against the Action of the Vessels: But, if no Removal follows, the Quantity of the Blood being abated, the Velocity is so likewise; and so the Blood loses of its Force. It were to be wish'd, insinuates Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> that <HI>Bellini</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>had establish'd a constant Token, a certain Sign of this Constitution of the Blood, that
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>suffers a Removal by bleeding, and of that other which does not suffer any thereby; because, for want of knowing this State and Disposition of the Blood, the Physician cannot be sure in what manner Bleeding will change it, and modify its Motion for the better or the worse. By reason of this Uncertainty and doubtful Success of Bleed∣ing, we must abstain therefrom, unless the Violence of Accidents inforce it: For if, in letting Blood, we render it more slow and compact, not only fewer animal Spirits will arise from it, and so the Stroke of the Beating of the Heart will be the more weak, but the Obstruction that afflicts the Capillaries, and holds 'em Captives, will ga∣ther new Force. Therefore, in the Begin∣ning of the Suppression, Bleeding does not seem to be indicated, unless one plainly sees the Means to break infallibly the com∣pact Texture of the Blood, and to redouble its Force by renewing its Velocity; let us examine, according to his Model, the Acti∣on of the Emmenagogues, that makes a Part of the Alteratives, and then consider, after<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. 14.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> if the Action is more certain, and the Success more allured. How says he, can the same Force surmount such different Resistances? How can a Remedy act in so uniform a manner, when the Sub∣jects upon which it operates are so unlike? There is nothing more ridiculous than to
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>expect from a Medicament a constant Acti∣on, a faithful Energy, an infallible and per∣manent Virtue, since it is not strange or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epugnant for one and the same Remedy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o produce contrary Effects.

This should have been clear'd up Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> should have instructed us in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and in this, as well as many other thing
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>but for the Death of the illustrious Author, we had Reason to hope from him further Lights. He flatters himself, that this fine Phaenomenon about the Courses can no way be explain'd, but by his Principles; yet I have ventured upon other Principles, and the System of the red Part of the Blood being engag'd in the Canals of its white Part, the prevailing Opinion of Dr. <HI>Helve∣tius;</HI> and which he has so much illustrated on the Subject of the Small Pox, of which he has so learnedly and usefully treated: A System! which gives Light into the Ex∣plication of the Hemorrhages and Inflamma∣tions, and which so perfectly agrees with the animal OEconomy, and natural Mecha∣nism. This System, I say, yields in nothing to that which Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> has given us, not only as the best, but as the only one. From the Principles I have already laid down, every one may make his Remarks upon the other Parts of the Author's Book, which I have not touch'd; and 'tis likely, that with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow much the more Attention and Care one shall apply to this, the more the Weak∣ness of his Reasoning will appear, and the Uncertainty of his Hypothesis. From the Reflections that have been hitherto made, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t may be gather'd, that 'tis, by no means, an indifferent Matter in Practice, to adopt indifferently, the System of the Rupture of the Vessels, or that of the Intrusion of the Blood into the lymphatick Canals: It is of
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>the highest Consequence, to chufe either the one or the other, to list on one Side or the other, and to appear more than ordina∣rily engaged or concern'd therein. If the Dispute here was only about some insipid, barren Point of Speculation amusing per∣haps to the Curious, but altogether useless, and without Influence on Practice, those who regard things only as they are useful, might perhaps slumber over it: But as our Business here is about a capital Point, which affects and concerns Practice to the highest Degree; since in the two Hypotheses the Manner of Cure is quite different; this ought to awake the Attention of all Practi∣tioners, inspire them with an extraordinary Relish for the present Subject, and rouze them totally out of their Indifference. Some will perhaps attack the fundamental Princi∣ple of these Reflections, which is, that the Blood owes its Velocity to the Impulse, and systaltick Virtue of the Solids; they will tell me, that the Vessels may be enormously distended and stretch'd to Excess, and still the Fluid which they contain may move on with Impetuosity, by virtue of the Medi∣caments that act upon it, that break its Texture, bruise its Mass, correct its Visci∣dity, quicken its <HI>Lentor,</HI> and separate its Parts; whence may result an Increase of its Force, a Renewal of its Velocity, and all this independent of the Oscillation of the Vessels, which still remain stretch'd, con∣strain'd,
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>and, as it were, captive. This has been proved by a Number of Experiments: A Mixture has been made of the Blood newly drawn from the Artery of a Dog, with several Druggs, which Mixture has given Occasion to various Phaenomena. The Blood mixt with the Spirit of Salt Armoni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c, was of a beautiful Red, and fine Consi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tence, mixt with a Decoction of Savin, or Horehound, it appeared of a deeper Red, and of a finer Substance; with <HI>Sydenham</HI>'s Liquid Laudanum, it was of a brighter Co∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, than with the Decoction of Savin, tho' not of a much finer Substance; with the Distilled Water of Rue, or Wormwood, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontinued very fluid from the First till the Thirteenth of <HI>February.</HI> A Mixture was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lso made of the Serum of Human Blood with the Tincture of Aloes drawn with Mint Water, with a Decoction of Savin, a De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oction of Gentian, Spirit of Tartar, of Saffron, of Turpentine, of Guaiacum, and of Hartshorn; the Oil of Turpentine, of Guaiacum, of Lavender, and of Cloves: By means of these Druggs successively ap∣ply'd, the Serum held fluid many Days, but nothing render'd it near so fluid and so fine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Decoction of the Jesuit's Bark. We have been also assured of the Working of Medicines upon the Blood, by Injections and Intromissions into the Body of a living Ani∣mal: We need but consult thereupon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. Chap. of the <HI>Emmenology</HI> of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>which proves by unquestionable Experiments, that the Blood is altered, changed, modifi∣ed, attenuated, broken, refin'd, set in Mo∣tion, and render'd fluid, by the Power of Emmenagogues: Therefore the Fluid hav∣ing another Mover than the Oscillation of the Solid, may be moved rapidly, impetu∣ously, and precipitately, even when this Os∣cillation is languishing, feeble, and impo∣tent: Therefore the Blood may have the Advantage of Mass, Velocity, Pressure and Percussion: Therefore, the Vessels being enormously dilated, weakened, and con∣strained, may be forc'd by the Action of the Blood, an Action which it has independent of the Vessels, and from which they can draw no Advantage; a Stroke consequent∣ly which it can give them, without being accused of Ingratitude, and without incur∣ring the odious Reproach of turning it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Power against those who gave it. This Stroke the Vessels will be unable to resist and be forc'd to yield to it, broken, dis∣arm'd, and overwhelm'd, not by the Power which they (the Vessels) lend to the Blood since they have none to lend, but by that which the Blood has borrowed elsewhere This is what may be objected against me and certainly I have given the Objection al its Weight, and wish heartily it might screen Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> from any Attack. I agree, that Medicines act upon the Humours, and inspire them with divers Qualities; but it is proper
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>to observe first, that this is not always im∣mediately, nor without the Participation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Solids. The first Operation of Reme∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies inwardly taken is upon the Stomach, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd thence spreads thro' the whole <HI>Genus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervosum,</HI> whereof this <HI>Viscus</HI> is a Part; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd consequently it is not strange, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tomach should transmit the Modifications <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Impressions which it receives. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uickest Operation of Medicines, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riskest Revolutions they cause, are due to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sudden Emotion which the Solids ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uire, when they are affected by the Medi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines, Smoke raises the Vapours, and cures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem; the Sprinkling of cold Water, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are Taste of good Wine, recovers from a Swoon, recals the straying Soul, and re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ores the lost Faculties. Remedies often∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes make no Change in the Blood, but by means of the Solids, which they first change, and whose Tone they alter, so that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecome more elastick, or more moderate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccording to the Action of the Remedies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat work and drive on the Fluids with more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r less Heat; whence ensues in the Blood more or less Refinement and Celerity. Dai∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Experience proves the great Share the Solids have both in the Disease and in the Cure; they are the Lords of the Animal OEconomy, the Principle of every Good, and of every Evil there.</P>
<P>But now, after those general undeter∣mined Ideas, which it is good to advance,
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>let us descend to something more particular, which more nearly regards the Difficulty we have been forming. Upon this I have two Reflections to make; the first, that the Virtue of Medicines has nothing at all to do with a State of Health. In the Case of an ordinary and natural Flowing, the Blood then makes its own Way through the Tu∣nicks of the Vessels, yet is not put in Mo∣tion, nor push'd, nor made fluent, refin'd and fluid, by the Power of the Medicines; therefore, if it has Celerity, it owes this to the Oscillation of the Solids, which, with redoubled Strokes of Systole, impart to it its present Motion, and accelerate its Flowing: For, I believe, it will be granted, without Difficulty, that the Blood which is not broken, agitated, and attenuated, by Remedies, can be no otherwise so, but by the Means of the Vessels; so that, if it is in Action, it must owe this Action solely to the Spring and Vibration of the Solids; what other Cause, on the present Hypothesis, can move the Blood? what other Mover, what other Principle can give any other ways Agitation to this Fluid? Does it move itself? Has it in its own Stock wherewitha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to put itself in Play? Does it draw its Power from its own Choice? I appeal to Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> himself, who undermines the Foundation of the Blood's intestine Power, and who, from the Beginning of his Work, gives a mortal Blow to the Fermentation
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>already so much discredited, and the finish∣ing Stroke to the Disgrace of this unhappy Hypothesis, by the desolating Refusal of his Protection to it, leaving it helpless in black Despair, and reducing it to a Condition ut∣terly abandon'd. The absurd Hypothesis, says he, of the Fermentations and Leavens is scarce any more in Vogue; 'tis even a long Time since the soundest Part of the Learned have banish'd it out of their Writings: <HI>Sed exolevit ferè hodie absurda illa de fermentis Doctrina, &amp; a sanissimis saltem scriptori∣bus, jamdiù explosa est.</HI> See then this Idol of the new Physick, and of the modern Philosophy, neglected, abandon'd, over∣whelm'd! What a Spectacle! a Doctrine which attracted such a Crowd of Partisans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecomes deserted and forlorn; the predomi∣nant Hypothesis, the sovereign Doctrine, the reigning Opinion, is falling into Widow∣hood, into Contempt and Slavery; is made a Tributary, languishing in Obscurity, and sighing all alone, finding none to comfort her in her Misery, and to raise her from the Ground, where she miserably grovels: Even those that listed under her Standard are asham'd to defend her Cause, quit her Side, and leave her in the Lurch. The Ways by which it was pretended to explain all the <HI>Animal OEconomy,</HI> Ways beaten and re∣beaten with so much Pomp and Solemnity, are now no more frequented; the Niches of the Ferments are destroy'd, and the Fer∣ments,
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>even the Instruments of Fermentati∣on, are taken from her, poor Thing! she has not allow'd her a Space ample enough to make her Pushes and her Sallies in; pent in Canals too streight, in Places too close for her; where she undergoes the Cruelty of being oppress'd and stifled, destitute, in these inextricable Difficulties, of all Relief, and unable to defend herself; all her Charms are fled from her; and her armed Adversa∣ries have laid violent Hands on all that be∣longs to her, depriving her of all that she can desire, or that can give her any Ad∣vantage O ye that have run thro' all the different Hypotheses! consider if there is one of 'em all so cruelly treated, and that languishes in a Situation so very deplorable as hers. What! says one, the Doctrine of the Ferments is no more in Use! and the <HI>Literati</HI> have hiss'd it off the Stage; sad Case! Is this the Fermentation that a while ago made such a Figure! Can you know her again by this Picture, you that used so to idolize her! you that still are so fond of her, is it possible, Sirs, that this can be the Object of your Delight and tenderest Ad∣dresses! This Offal, this May-game, this Bitch with a Bottle at her Tail, can this be your Favourite Mistress! Can you own this your Idol in so disguis'd a Metamorphosis Fermentation is then in Disgrace with Dr. <HI>Freind;</HI> and according to him, with al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the best Authors too. Then he can't admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>in the Blood a Virtue proper to make it cir∣culate; it is therefore allow'd to believe, that the Motion, the Swiftness of the Blood, in the natural State of Health, is the Effect of the Action of the Vessels that press, push, and hurry it; and the Acknowledgment of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> who rejects this Fermentation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eads to this Thought, conducts to this Consequence. This just comes to what we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been demonstrating, that the Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annot make an ill Use of the Celerity which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t has from the Vessels, thereby to break <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese; whence it follows, either that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erms can never naturally flow, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Aid of Medicines; or that the Velocity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Blood is not necessary to the Flux, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut is even contrary to it. If the Fluid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aturally holds its Celerity from the Solid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich hastens its Way; and if, by Virtue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f this Celerity, the Fluid cannot break the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olid, as hath been prov'd; then, of ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essity, Nature alone cannot push the Terms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nless it be the Abundance, and not the Ve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>city of the Blood that makes 'em flow. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> makes the principal Mover <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Flux to consist in the Swiftness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Blood; and the principal Hinderance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd ordinary Cause of the Suppression, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsist in its Slowness. So that it does not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em possible, on the Principles of this Au∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or, to explain how the Flowing of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erms is procur'd by Nature alone. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econd Reflection I have to make is, That
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>the Fluids attenuated, bruised, and broken; by the Force of Emmenagogues, do not so strongly oppose the Action of the Solids; the Blood render'd supple, flowing, and docile, by these Medicaments, suffers itself to be led, subdued, and jerk'd along by the Vessels, which, finding no more, as before, an invincible Obstacle in the gross and com∣pact Mass that the Remedies have reduc'd and subtiliz'd, recover their Ease, resume their Vigour, and set themselves at Liberty▪ Whence we see, that the Emmenagogues at the same Time that they set the Bloo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at large, set also the Vessels at their Ease too. Now, being at their Ease, 'tis evi¦dent, that they are not so liable to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> broken; yet the Blood, upon which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Remedies act, might be so abundant, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it could not swell and rarify, without for¦cing the Canals to burst: In this Case, if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Medicines melt and rarify it, it seems tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they will infallibly occasion the breaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the vascular Tunicks, which, as they can¦not stretch any further, must needs crac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But we have observ'd, that the Blood, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦riv'd to such a Pitch of Abundance, to such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Degree of Grossness, is not fit to be wroug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon by Attenuants, because these can la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no Hold of it: We have observ'd, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Circumstance, the Usefulness, and even th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Necessity of Bleeding, to set the Attenuan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at Work; therefore, in an excessive <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦thora,</HI> in an extream Viscidity, Emmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦gogues,
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>being equally as impotent as the Vessels, are as little able to do any thing as these are. That which hinders these from strongly contracting, hinders also those from fastening upon the thicken'd Humours; whence it seems to follow, that the Blood cannot apply even the Velocity which it receives from the Emmenagogues to break the Vessels; because the Remedies cannot animate it so much as it shou'd be, but with the Assistance of the elastick Vessels. They do not indeed import Fluidity; but this is not progressive Motion, the Motion of Cir∣culation, which is not to be obtain'd but by the systaltick Virtue of the Vessels. The Blood attenuated by Emmenagogues, may well become Fluid; but it cannot acquire Velocity, save only by being push'd, beaten, and jerk'd along. According to Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> the Stroke of the Blood is that which makes its greatest Strength: Now, the Stroke, that is to say, the Briskness of the Shock, the Violence of the Percussion, does not precisely come from the Fluidity; but, because the Fluid is strongly struck upon by the Solid, which Blows it again retaliates, and, in its Turn, re-buffets the Solid; there∣fore, if the Vessels were flat and unactive, in Torture, and in Captivity, and the Fluids left to the sole Action of the Attenuants, these Fluids would not receive Force enough wherewith to strike upon the Solids; they would acquire but an indolent Fluidity,
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>only a Dis-union of their Parts, a Dissoluti∣on of their Mass, incapable of any great Effects; they could not contract that Impe∣tuosity necessary to give Strength to their Blow, Briskness to their Shock, Power and Force to their Percussion. Our Author him∣self deduces the Velocity of the Blood from the vehement Pulsation of the Heart, and of the Arteries; a Pulsation produc'd, as he says, by the Affluence of the animal Spirits: Whereas, these animal Spirits them∣selves can be nothing but the Work and Effect of the Spring of those Parts that agitate and push them to the Degree of Fineness which they have. Therefore the Velocity of the Blood is the Effect of the Expulsion of the Vessels; wherefore, it can∣not make Use thereof to break them: There∣fore, if Emmenagogues excite the Flux of the <HI>Menses,</HI> this cannot be by the Velocity which they impart to the Blood; but rather by the Swelling, the Rarefaction, the dis∣orderly Turgescence which they produce therein; by the Means of which the vascu∣lar Tunicks give way, not to the Force of the Percussion, but to the Excess of their own Dilation. Another Difficulty might be started against me; the Vessels, in the Effort they make to drive on with Swift∣ness and Percipitation the Blood subjected to their Power, may they not break them∣selves? Are they not even more liable to be broken, being active than unactive; by
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>Exercise, than Indolence; by Fatigue, than Repose? Are not they who labour hardest, most expos'd to the Misfortune of bursting Veins and Arteries? Have not we seen Vessels broken by the Shocks of a violent Cough, and the cruellest Hemorrhages produc'd by the Heat of a burning Summer? It is not there∣fore strange, that the uterine Vessels, tho' vi∣gorous enough to animate the Blood, shou'd yield to the Blow of which themselves are the Cause; and their Vigour, far from forti∣fying and defending them against their Burst∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, only renders them more proper, more fit and dispos'd for it. I own the Vessels may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roken by their own Pains and Fatigue; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t must be also confess'd, that it is by Accident when this Misfortune happens, and that these are Cases for which none undertakes to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nvariable Rules, and Geometrical Demon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trations, such as Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> has attempted to give us; there is too much Uncertainty in the Rupture of the Vessels; and 'tis too fortuitous a Case, to draw and deduce thence an Effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sure, so constant, so natural, so regular, as the Phaenomenon of the Monthly Courses. Besides, the Rupture of the Vessels is not a thing so common as one imagines; bleeding at the Nose, spitting of Blood, Accidents very frequent and vulgarly attributed to Ruptures, don't so much denote broken Vessels, but ra∣ther such as meet discharging Canals, that terminate in the Sanguines; and do not so much declare the Extravasation of the Blood,
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>as its Passage into the Emunctories. Why, indeed, so few Ruptures in the slenderest, tenderest Fibres within the Body, which are remote from Places of Discharge, whilst we discover so many and so often just by the Issues, near the Excretories, and in the Blood-Vessels, most within the Reach of the Outlets, most known and best remark'd? This Obser∣vation justly intimates that which is attribu∣ted to the Rupture of the Canals, is usually but the Effect of the Intrusion of the Blood into the Lymphaticks. These seem to me the strongest Objections that can be made against me; and the proper Answers to be made to them: Dr. <HI>Freind</HI>'s System, therefore, cannot be defended, and still lies under the same Difficulties.</P>
<P>Yet, after all, can't flatter myself, that I have, with any Solidity, taken up so learned a Man as Dr. <HI>Freind:</HI> What I have hitherto advanced I look upon it rather as a Web of Objections to be answer'd, than as a Criticism to be redoubted: If I have not attack'd my Author with Advantage, I shall at least have the Glory of having studied him with Application. It is always good to betake ourselves to the best Authors, 'tis pleasant to contemplate their Beauties; and even when we attack them unsuccess∣fully, yet don't we apply thereto, without reaping an Advantage. But, should my Objections be made with some Foundation, I would not take it amiss to be compared
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>to a rebellious Child, who battles its own Nurse, because, by her succulent and well-condition'd Milk, she has supplied him with the Strength to do it. Foster'd by the Reading of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> imbu'd with his Lessons, improv'd by his Knowledge, en∣lighten'd by his Light, I have made use thereof against himself. I own, I should have had no Success in engaging him, if I had not improv'd by studying him; if I had not gather'd my Knowledge from reading and meditating him; and if, before I made War upon him, I had not learnt my Disci∣pline under him. If we gain a Victory over good Authors, 'tis because themselves supply us with the Means to gain it.</P>
