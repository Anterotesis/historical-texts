<HEAD>TO George Cheyne, <HI>M. D. FELLOW</HI> OF THE <HI>Royal Society.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F any Thing in this World, be worthy of a wise Man's Care, it is Health; and as Mankind, cannot suf∣ficiently testify their Gratitude to those, who labour in the Practice
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>of healing Diseases, with Diligence, Candour, and Judgment; so on the other hand, they cannot enough detest those who set up for the <HI>Art of Healing,</HI> without any other Qua∣lification, but their <HI>Diploma,</HI> to Re∣commend them; and having nothing in their view, but making or mend∣ing their Fortunes, neglect that Knowledge, which is absolutely ne∣cessary, to make their Practice Ho∣nourable and Successful.</P>
<P>They who write Well and Ill, on the Subject of Health, ought in like-manner, to be set in opposition to one another, and as their Labours tend to the Preservation or Preju∣dice of Health, so ought they to become the Objects of our Favour, or Contempt.</P>
<P>As all Mankind, are more or less frail, they therefore ought to bear a great deal from one anothers Folly; and the trade of Scribling, among the rest of Men's folly's, may be so far indulged, as not to be censured, so
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>long as it continues harmeless and innocent; but as soon as it ceases to be so, it is every reasonable Man's duty, to endeavour to stop its tor∣rent, and divert as much as possibly he can, the Mischief it threatens.</P>
<P>If a Man imagines he can oblige the World, by communicating some thing useful; as he ought by no means to suppress it, so what he advances, ought to be attended with the Reasons that led him into his Opinion; and these shou'd be of∣fered to the Consideration of such only, whose application in that way to which they tend, hath made them Judges of their Sufficiency; and then if his Arguments shou'd prove too weak, to support his Oppinion, no other harm will ensue, but his Loss of Labour, and that share of Praise, which probably he might expect as the Reward of it.</P>
<P>But when a <HI>Physician</HI> shall pre∣sume, to lay down <HI>Practical Rules,</HI> to all Mankind without Distinction,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>for the Preservation of Health; and if these Rules shou'd prove pernicious and destructive to it, People will be apt to imagine, that he puts himself upon a Level with these <HI>Savages</HI> on the Sea-coast, who set out false Lights, to invite distressed <HI>Mariners</HI> to their destruction; that they may reap the Benefit of the Ship-wreck.</P>
<P>You best know SIR, what were the Motives, that prompted you to publish your <HI>Essay of Health and long Life,</HI> as you call it; but I doubt, many will have Reason to wish it had never appear'd; it is now almost in every bodys hand, and that seeming self-deniedness in your Preface, that Air of <HI>Piety</HI> that you put on, in almost every other Period, will perswade many to be∣lieve, so good a Man, wou'd never publish a Book to pamper his Vani∣ty, and wou'd never pretend to the Knowledge of any thing he was an absolute Stranger to; these Con∣siderations, will, I am affraid weigh with many to their Distruction.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<P>I intend by this to show, that e∣very Attempt of this kind must be fruitless, if not pernicious, by en∣couraging People to tamper with their Constitutions, which they cannot possibly regulate by any General Rules. And if your Per∣formance proves, that your know∣ledge of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> is not quite so extensive as perhaps it ought to be; you must not take it amiss if I point out a few of those Pas∣sages, from whence that unhappy Conclusion naturaly flows. If the Reasons I shall offer to this purpose, are not sufficient to make it appear, they cannot hurt you; but on the Contrary, if they happen to be just and convincing, no good Man will blame me for undeceiving People, in what regards a thing, so essential to their Well-being as Health.</P>
<P>I have no Inclination to trace you thro' every thing that I think wrong in this Performance, because, beside the irksome Employment of finding
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>fault, that wou'd oblige me to write a Book at least as large as yours. I shall endeavour therefore, to be as short as the Subject will allow me.</P>
<P>It is a common Saying, as you observe, that a Man past Forty, is either a Fool, or a Physician; and if it means any thing, it only im∣plys, that by so long experience, a Man that is not a Fool, will know what things have best agreed with him; and his Reason will direct him to continue the Use of them, till some alteration in his Constitution makes them hurtful; and when the happens, he will find there is some∣thing else required to make a Man a Physician, besides living forty Years in the World; for beside Diseases, old Age will alter a Man's Constitution, and bring on Symp∣toms, which he could have no expe∣rience of, when less advanced in Years. Of what use then, can his former Experience be to him, in Cir∣cumstances he never was in before?</P>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<P>But let us suppose, that by forty Years Experience, a Man may have discover'd the proper Method he shou'd follow, through all the dif∣ferent Stages and Accidents of Life, to preserve his Health, and prolong his Days; yet this Method will only be applicable to himself, and such Constitutions as exactly resemble his own, in every Circumstance; and such another, perhaps will not be to be found among all the rest of Man∣kind.</P>
<P>You tell us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 4.</NOTE> <Q>"The Reflection is not more common than just, that he who lives Physicaly lives Miserably, the truth is too great a nicety and exactness about e∣very minute Circumstance that may impare our Health, is such a Yoke and Slavery, as no Man of a free and generous Spirit wou'd submit to; 'tis as the <HI>Poet</HI> expresses it, to dye for fear of dying."</Q></P>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<P>If this had been the Effect of any previous Reflection, or if you had believ'd it, <HI>Charity</HI> inclines me to think, that you wou'd not have been so industrious to contradict it, as appears from your subsequent <HI>Rules of Health;</HI> (as you are pleased to call them,) but have left Mankind to act for the Benefit of their Health, as Reason and Experience should dictate to them; and when they are Indispos'd, to call in those Aids that are proper to give them Relief; I mean such Physicians, whose Skill in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> and the <HI>Ma∣teria Medica,</HI> hath render'd them capable to judge of the Nature of a Distemper, and to apply the pro∣per Means to remove it. I am sure every reasonable Man is a better Judge of what he ought to do, for the Benefit of his Health, than any Physican can be, who is not inti∣mately acquainted with all the Cir∣cumstances of his Constitution.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<P>When a Man has acquired a com∣petent Knowledge of the <HI>Animal Oe∣conomy,</HI> and of the Power and Effi∣cacy of these Medicines, proper to restore and preserve Health, to such a Man, I believe it is possible to lay down such general Rules, and Di∣rections, as may enable him to prac∣tice the <HI>Art of healing,</HI> with success and ease.</P>
<P>But to pretend to direct Men ig∣norant of these things, how to go∣vern themselves, to preserve or re∣store their Health, is equally reaso∣nable, as if one should give Direct∣ions to a blind Man, to go a long Journey by himself, thro' ways that he never cou'd possibly have any <HI>Idea</HI> of, and where every step out of the way wou'd endanger if not destroy his Life. For how shall Men be able to adjust either the Kind or Quantity of Diet or Medicine, that may be necessary, to Constitutions they are Strangers to? How shall they be able to judge for themselves, of
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>that Exercise, and Air, that is proper for them, when they are unacquaint∣ed with the Nature of those Symp∣toms, that can only enable them to distinguish.</P>
<P>You will perhaps say, that you have acquainted them with these Symptoms to which your Directions are suitable; but may not a Person be afflicted with any Symptoms you can mention, and at the same time have others, which wou'd make the Method that might be proper to re∣move such Symptoms, were they alone, destructive to the Patient, now they are complicated with o∣thers, which you cou'd not possibly foresee.</P>
<P>What then must become of that Person, who having these Symp∣toms you mention, follows your Advice, and whose want of Know∣ledge will make him disregard those other Symptoms that will make your prescription pernicious?</P>
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
<P>Many Attempts have been made to lay down general Rules, for Mankind without distinction, to pre∣serve their Health and prolong their Lives; but these Productions never obtain'd the End they aim'd at; be∣cause the Constitutions and Habits of Mens bodies differ so much from one another, that any general Rule laid down to any number of Men for this Purpose, must be destruct∣ive, at least to the greatest Part of them, if they all comply with it.</P>
<P>For if every Man, was exactly to pursue that method to <HI>Health and long Life,</HI> that is proper for him to follow, perhaps we should not find two in ten thousand, exactly pursu∣ing the same Course, though their End wou'd be all the same; so that any general Rule enioyn'd to these ten thousand, wou'd but at best be useful to two, and hurtful or de∣structive to all the rest.</P>
<P>It very rarely, or never happens, that Diseases, even of the same De∣nomination,
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>ever affected two Per∣sons, in the same manner, in every Symptom, and the Method of Cure ought always to vary with the Symp∣toms. How then can you tell a Man, after what manner he shou'd govern himself in a Disorder, when you cannot possibly know, in what man∣ner he is to be affected with it? Or tell how a Constitution shou'd be be regulated, which you are altoge∣ther a Stranger to? And these va∣letudinary crazy Constutions, that you address your self to, actually labour under Distempers, or they wou'd not be so; and perhaps there are not two such in all <HI>England,</HI> whose Complaints, and Constitu∣tions don't differ in many Circum∣stances.</P>
<P>So infinite is the variety of Dis∣eases and Constitutions, that the best Physician in the World, can only determine, for these he is inti∣mately acquainted with, and whose Symptoms he himself hath examin'd,
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>and cannot with any safety, de∣pend upon any thing, but the con∣viction of his own Senses, to regu∣late his Practice by.</P>
<P>What then must the Complexion of your Merit be, who pretending to point out the way to <HI>Health and long Life,</HI> lay down Rules for Man∣kind to follow, which perhaps will never be useful to any, and may be hurtful and destructive to all, who regard your Advice? and the great∣er your Reputation as a Physician, the worse will be the Consequences, and consequently the greater your Guilt.</P>
<P>Your Rules for Health, are all of them, either such as have been known to all Mankind, since the World began; or mistaken Notions, founded upon no Principles that ever reason dictated.</P>
<P>When, or by whom was it ever denied, or even so much as doubted by the Thinking-Part of Mankind, (and you tell us, you don't write
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>to the Insensible) that Eating and Drinking to excess, were destruct∣ive to Health; but then it must be own'd, that no Body before you, ever presumed to determine the Quantity of Meat and Drink, that a Man should take, and prescribed that quantity to every Body, with∣out distinction; this is indeed in∣tirely New, and I hope in Charity to the rest of Mankind, that you are the only Man in being, capable of laying down such a Rule.</P>
<P>That a very great regard ought to be had to the Constitution of the <HI>Air,</HI> to restore and preserve Health, is a greater Truth than you seem to be aware of; but then, it is as true, that no one Constitution of <HI>Air,</HI> will agree with every habit of Body; and a Physician must be intimately acquainted with a Man's Constitu∣tion, before he can prescribe a pro∣per Temperament of <HI>Air</HI> for him to live in.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
<P>You affirm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pag. 46.</NOTE> <Q>"That you have constantly observed good Effects from leaving off suddenly great quantities of Wine and Flesh∣meats too, by those long accust∣omed to both."</Q> I will not here dispute what you say is Fact; but I shall beg leave to enquire a little into the Arguments you give us, to support the Reasonableness of this Assertion.</P>
<P>You tell us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 45.</NOTE> <Q>"That nothing is more rediculous than the common Plea for continuing in drinking on large quantities of spirituous Liquours, <HI>viz.</HI> Because they have been ac∣custom'd so to do, and they think it dangerous to leave it off of a sudden, it were as reasonable for him that is fallen into the Fire or Water to lie there, because of the Danger of removing him suddenly."</Q> But this Argument of yours is to no Purpose, unless you can prove, that a Perseverance, in that Life a Man has been accust∣omed
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>to, will as suddenly destroy his Life, as lying in the Fire or Wa∣ter will; and your other Argument is,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 45.</NOTE> <Q>"That no Man was ever a∣fraid to forbear strong Liquours in an acute Distemper, what quantity soever he might have drank in his Health."</Q></P>
<P>Here SIR, you must give me leave to inform you, that Diseases and Health, are Circumstances, directly opposite to one another, and what may be proper and fit to be done in the one, may by no means be safe, or convenient in the other.</P>
<P><HI>e. g.</HI> In a continued Fever, where Obstructions prevail in most of the <HI>Capillary Vessels,</HI> and the usual dis∣charges from the Body, by insensi∣ble Perspiration, <HI>&amp;c</HI> Being ob∣structed the larger and passable Ves∣sels, to which the circulating Fluid is confin'd, are for that reason over∣charg'd, and to give a Person in this Case, even that kind, and quantity of meat and drink, that wou'd be
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>necessary in a state of Health to pre∣serve it, wou'd increase the Distem∣per, by increasing the quantity of Fluid, in the passable or pervious Vessels.</P>
<P>In all these we call acute Cases, the circulating Fluid is not only con∣fined to a smaller number of Vessels, but there being a Check put to the usual Expence and Discharge from it, by the several <HI>Emunctories</HI> of the Body, which made the former sup∣ply from eating and drinking in a State of health useful: <HI>Temperance</HI> therefore, whatever hath been a Man's way of living, is not only safe, but absolutely necessary, till these Ob∣structions which are the Disease, be removed; and the several <HI>Excretory's</HI> are again qualified, to throw off the Superfluities, from the Mass of Blood. Care must likewise be taken in these Cases, to dilute the Blood, and re∣lax the Fibres; and these Medicines which can effect this, will dissolve the Union of the combin'd Particles,
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>that obstructed the <HI>Capillary's,</HI> and stood in the Way of the circulating Fluid, or Extra-corporeal Secretions.</P>
<P>But if these diluteing Medicines, which are convenient in this Case, were given to one, where the Quan∣tity of Secretions, are to the Quan∣tity of Fluid in the Body, in that just Proportion, that is necessary to Health; they wou'd increase the Secretions, destroy that necessary Proportion, and beget Diseases.</P>
<P>And if a Man in a good State of Health, who has accustom'd himself to eat and drink plentifully, shou'd suddenly leave of that Method, and betake himself to a spare Diet all at once; the <HI>Excretory's</HI> which throw of the Extra-corporeal Secretions, being large enough to carry off the Refuse of his Extravagance, would upon so sudden a Change, throw off more than such an abstenious-diet cou'd spare, and leave too little in the Vessels, to support the Circula∣tion, with that velocity that is neces∣sary
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>to Health, for that the Blood may be propelled with that degree of ve∣locity, that is necessary to preserve Health, the Vessels must all be fill'd in such a manner, as the Impulse of the Fluid, and the Re-action of the Vessels, may be adjusted to this ne∣cessary velocity; more or less will beget a Disease: And the Blood∣vessels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Being suddenly drain'd, and depriv'd of their usual supply, the pressure of the Fluid against them will decrease with the Quantity of it; and the Impulse of the Fluid, and the Re-action of the Vessels be∣ing equal, such a Diminution, from a Constitution that is not labouring under an acute Distemper, must ne∣cessarily lessen the Velocity of the Fluid proportionaly.</P>
<P>Hence it is evident, that the sud∣den Change which you recommend, wou'd make such a Disproportion between the Quantity of Fluid, and the Dimensions of the Vessels, as wou'd render the Circulation very
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>languid; and this slow motion of the Fluid, wou'd give its Parts an Opportunity of combineing, and for∣ming Bodies too gross, to pass thro' the more minute <HI>Capillary</HI>'s, and the Obstructions that wou'd ensue from thence, wou'd consequently be the Fountain of many grievous Distem∣pers. The ill Consequences of such sudden Changes, have been taken Notice of, by every Judicious Ob∣server in Physick, since <HI>Hippocrates;</HI> and as many of them, as have wrote upon this Subject, have faithfully caution'd Mankind against them.</P>
<P>I have already given my Reasons, why I think it dangerous to pre∣scribe either Diet, or Medicine at random. And now give me leave to point at some things, which ap∣pear to me in a very odd Light. In the Directions you have given to re∣gulate the quantity of Food.</P>
<P>You observe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 39.</NOTE> <Q>"Since our Ap∣petites are deceitful, and Weight and Measure troublesome and
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>Singular; we must have recourse to a Rule independent of our Sen∣sations, <HI>&amp;c".</HI></Q> You propose here, to give us a Rule for measuring the Quantity of our Food, independent of our Sensations; and if this has any meaning at all, it must be di∣recting us, to eat and drink by guess, without any regard to the Quantity; for we cannot possibly form a Judg∣ment of any thing, without the Assistance of our Senses. But after∣wards you advise us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 40.</NOTE><HI>to measure the Quantity by our Eye,</HI> but then there is one of the Sensations employ'd, unless you deny Vision to be a Sen∣sation. Then you go on;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 40.</NOTE> <Q>"Thus, the two Wings of a middling Pullet, or one Wing and both Legs; three Ribs of a middling Neck of Mut∣ton; two middling Slices of a Leg or Shoulder of Mutton, somewhat less of Beef may be sufficient, <HI>&amp;c".</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now if it were prudent or reaso∣nable, to determine the Quantity of Meat, that a Man should take,
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>without being apprised of the Na∣ture of his Constitution; what can any Body make of this Direction? As if a middling Slice of Meat, was a determined Quantity, which every Body knew; however People may determine what they themselves call a middling Slice, yet I am sure, it is impossible for any Body, that has not been accustomed to see you eat, to tell what you mean by it.</P>
<P>Every thinking Man, I believe is an Enemy to Debauching in strong Liquours, but I cannot be of your Opinion, when you recommend and prefer small Wines to the stronger Kind. Indeed if a Man was oblig∣ed to drink a large Quantity of Wine every Day, then small Wines should be prefer'd, provided they were sound: But as no Man is obliged to drink more than he cares for, I should prefer a convenient Quantity of the more generous sort, either by it self, or mix'd with Wa∣ter; if it was for no other Reason,
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>but because such Wines, being much less Subject to Putrefaction than the smaller Kind, People will have a much better Chance, for drinking that which is Good. For notwith∣standing the vast Quantity of Wine drank in <HI>England,</HI> very few are Judges when it is good of its Kind, or otherwise, unless it happen to be spoil'd to a very great Degree. And you your self confess the good Effects of generous Wines and Food, not only moderately, but plentifully taken: where you say,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 14.</NOTE> <Q>"That those who have drank strong Liquours so plentifully, as to have thereby a strong Circulation and full Perspiration, seldom or never catch Cold. And this is the Reason why rich Foods and gene∣rous Wines, moderately used, become so excellent an Antedote in Infectious and Epedemick Distempers, <HI>&amp;c".</HI></Q> You are so far in the Right in my Opinion, in imagining that Men are less apt to
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>receive injuries from the <HI>Circumam∣bient Air,</HI> when their Vessels are filled by rich Food and generous Wines, than diseased People are, whose Vessels are lank for want of that competent Quantity of Fluid necessary to Health. But this truth is the Consequence of a Cause, quite different from what you ima∣gine it. You suppose the violence with which the matter of Perspira∣tion flys from the Body (which you call a brisk <HI>Atmosphere</HI>) resists the pressure of the Circumambient Air, and prevents its having access to the Body. Your Words are these, speaking of the effects of rich Food and generous Wines, you say they<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 15.</NOTE> <Q>"Not only banish Fear and Terror, but as they make so full and free a stream of Perspiration, and main∣tain so active and brisk an <HI>Atmo∣sphere,</HI> as suffers no noxious steams or mixtures, in the Air to come within it, but drives and beats off the Enemy to a distance; but
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>Persons of viscous heavy Fluids, of poor and sizey Juices, of little or no Perspiration, such as generally all Studious, Sedentary and sickly Persons are, but especially those that are subject to Nervous Dis∣orders, must necessarily suffer under these poisonous Mixtures in the Air, if they do not cauti∣ously and carefully sence against them, or take not a present Re∣medy and Antidote when tainted, for besides the Air that gets thro' the Perspiratory Ducts into our Blood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Doctor <HI>James Keill,</HI> in his Essays upon the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> com∣puted the force of the Heart, equal to a Weight of 5 Ounces only; and that the velocity of the Blood at the Heart, to that in the minute <HI>Capillary</HI>'s (and he did not descend so far as the <HI>Excretory</HI>'s of insensible Perspiration) was as 5.233 to 1. And here you suppose, that the mat∣ter of insensible Perspiration, whose
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>velocity is the least of any, is upon some occasions, propelled with a Force, sufficient to repell the Pressure of the <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> upon the Surface of a Man's Body, which in a Me∣dium is computed to be equal to be∣tween 39.900 and 40.000 Pound.</P>
<P>I confess Dr. <HI>Keill</HI> was mistaken in this Calculation; for if the force, which propells the <HI>Animal</HI> Fluids, was so much inferiour to the Pres∣sure of the <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> the Circu∣lation cou'd not be carried on, and Consequently no <HI>Animal</HI> cou'd ex∣ist in the Air we live in; for that Reason, I shall not press this Doct∣rine as an Argument against you; nor is it necessary here, to deter∣mine, how much you are mistaken in the other Extream.</P>
<P>But the true Cause, why People whose Vessels are well filled with good Nourishment, from rich Food, and generous Wines, are not apt to catch Cold, or be tainted with infectious Distempers, is because, when the Vessels are all thus filled,
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>the <HI>Excretory</HI>'s, upon the Surface of the Body, are charged in proportion; and being swell'd with the Matter of Perspiration, they press against, and shut up these Orrifices, which convey the Air, or any thing else from the Surface of our Bodies, to our Mass of Blood; and when the Vessels are not filled as they ought to be, from Sickness, or any other Cause, the <HI>Excretory</HI>'s of Perspira∣tion are proportionaly empty, and consequently can't press upon these Orrifices, but will leave them open to receive the Air, or any kind of Fluid, that may happen to be ap∣plied to the Skin of such a Person. These <HI>Excretory</HI>'s that emitt the Matter of insensible Perspiration, can never be the same, which receive any thing into the Blood from with∣out us; because if they are not Ob∣structed, they are constantly throw∣ing out the Matter of insensible Perspiration, and they cannot pos∣sibly, give access to one Fluid from
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>without, at the same time they are discharging another from within; and if they are obstructed, they can neither do the one nor the other.</P>
<P>That Fat is harder to digest, than the more solid part of <HI>Animals,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 25.</NOTE> is a Position you seem to be very cer∣tain of and quote SIR <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Authority, to support your Opinion; and though the Justice which the World has done to the Character of that great Man, will leave but few Dissenters, from any Opinion of his; yet since the best may err, and the greatest Genious may be sometime mistaken, I have ventur'd to think differently, and shall give you my Reasons why I do so.</P>
<P>Don't we find, that Fat disolves more easily, than any other part of of the <HI>Animal</HI> substance, by all the Trials we can make to that pur∣pose out of the Stomach; what then should make it less soluble in the Stomach, than any where else? And don't we find that a much less
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>degree of Heat, than is in the Sto∣mach of any <HI>Animal,</HI> will disolve it infinitely sooner, than any other part of the <HI>Animal</HI> can be dissolved, by all the artful Contrivances we can think of? So that abstracting from the Action of the Stomach, the heat alone, wou'd dissolve or di∣gest it sooner, than any other Sub∣stance can be.</P>
<P>And if because of its smoothness, as you imagine, it cou'd in some measure elude the Action of the Stomach, yet its Parts being less tenacious, than that of any other substance, the less force would be sufficient to divide them. But when the Stomach is contracted to pro∣mote digestion, the Contraction be∣ing equal in every part of it, the Matter contain'd in it, cannot pos∣sibly evade the Pressure, tho it shou'd shift its Place. And I am informed by Men of great Probity, who tell me from their own Experience, that the <HI>Turtle,</HI> which they eat frequently
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> is the fattest of all <HI>Animals;</HI> and that it is the wholesomest, and lightest Food in the World.</P>
<P>I can't imagine, why all these <HI>Invectives</HI> against <HI>Punch;</HI> as <HI>Rack-Punch</HI> is commonly made in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> tho' I believe this Composi∣tion may not be agreeable to every Constitution, yet I imagine by the generality of People, it may be drank as safely, as an equal quan∣tity of Wine; for since it contains a smaller quantity of Spirits, it will consequently be less apt to heat us.</P>
<P>You say<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge 55.</NOTE> <Q>"every thing that has passed the Fire, so that it has had due time to divide and penetrate its Parts, as far as it possibly can, retains a Caustick burning quality ever after, <HI>&amp;c".</HI></Q> This Observa∣tion holds true, in Bodies which have been calcined; but the Fire never has that effect upon any mat∣ter, while its Parts continue defen∣ded and diluted with Water; (and
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>Water is the Basis of every Liquid, except Oil) this is evident in that single Instance of Hartshorn, which when calcin'd, is in some degree Corrosive, and receives that quality from the Fire; but are not the Parts of this same Substance, divided and seperated by the force of the Fire, when it is boild in Water to make Jelly? And did ever any body ap∣prehend a Caustick burning quality in Hartshorn Jelly? Has not the Fire the same access to the Plants, from whence, the simple insiped Waters of the Shops are distill'd, as to Wine, from whence you distill Brandy? Does it not separate their Parts in the same manner? And as there any thing caustick either in the Plants which remain in the <HI>Alembick,</HI> or in the Water drawn from them?</P>
<P>According to your Notion, it would add to the fiery Quality of Brandy, or any other Spirit, to boil it over a Fire; but make that Ex∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ment when you will, and you
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>will find it produce a very contrary Effect, tho' you stop it so close that nothing can escape, but what pas∣ses thro' the Pores of the Vessel; and tho' the subtile Parts of the Fire, may get access thro' the Pores of the Vessel, yet it can never affect any Particle of Matter contain'd in it so as to burn it, as long as there re∣mains any Water, to dilute and defend it.</P>
<P>That there is Oil in the Compo∣sition of all inflamable Spirits I own; But every body knows, whenever Fire gets access to Oil, it sets it in a Flame; and if the Parts of the Fire, did incorporate with this Oil, as you say it does, wou'd it not have the same Effect and destroy it? This is obvious from your own Ob∣servation, of the <HI>continued Distilla∣tion of Spirits,</HI> they will at last, when they come off without any Water to defend them, as you say, <HI>be re∣duced into liquid Flames, which will of themselves evaporate into visible Flames and Fumes.</HI></P>
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
<P>It is not my business in this Place, to write a Disertation upon the Na∣ture of Fire, and Causticks; it is sufficient to show you, (and I think it is evident from what I have said,) that the Fire contributes nothing to <HI>Arrack, Brandy,</HI> or <HI>Rum,</HI> &amp;c. but as it seperates these Spirits from grosser Bodies, from which they are drawn, and in which they actually existed, before Distillation.</P>
<P>The Juices of <HI>Lemons</HI> and <HI>Oranges,</HI> (and we use no other in <HI>England,</HI> but what are brought from Abroad) are every Day given with good success, by Physicians, who justly deserve that Character, to their Patients, in several Cases, in much greater Quan∣tities, than People who are not Drun∣kard's ever take them in <HI>Punch.</HI> And you own that Sugar and Water are no Enemies to our Constitutions.</P>
<P>You say<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 57.</NOTE> <Q>"in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> where from the necessity of drink∣ing much, because of the violen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the <HI>Heat,</HI> and from the want
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>of Proper <HI>Liquors</HI> there, they are forced to drink much <HI>Punch,</HI> tho' <HI>Lemons</HI> and <HI>Oranges,</HI> be in their full Perfection, they are universal∣ly afflicted with <HI>nervous</HI> and <HI>mor∣tal</HI> dry <HI>Belly-Aches, Palsies, Cramps</HI> and <HI>Convulsions;</HI> which cut them off in a few Days, entirely owing to this <HI>poisonous</HI> Mixture, <HI>&amp;c".</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now I wou'd fain ask you, if all the People in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> are afflicted with this Distemper, and if it cuts them off in a few Days, how could ever that Place be Inhabited? But perhaps you only mean those who drink <HI>Punch;</HI> however that be, you are misinformed of the State of that Country, for they have plenty of Wines, from all the Countries which produce it, and <HI>Ale</HI> and <HI>Cyder</HI> from <HI>England;</HI> and are under no necessity of drinking much <HI>Punch,</HI> for want of other Liquors; <HI>Madera</HI> Wine and Water, is the most agreeable and wholesomest drink imaginable, and this they hive in so great Plenty,
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>that they make it serve the com∣mon Purposes of drinking, as we do small Beer in <HI>England.</HI> Nor is it to be suppos'd, that a People whose Commerce obliges them to have Dealings, with every Country in <HI>Europe,</HI> wou'd want any Conveni∣ency that <HI>Europe</HI> can afford.</P>
<P>And I am inform'd by a Gentle∣man of good Understanding, and great Integrity, who lived upwards of 30 Years in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and but lately came from it; that the Disease called the dry Belly-Ach, which is so peculiar to that Country, attacks the Women as well as the Men; and that the Women there, are particularly Remarkable for their Temperance, and abstinence from strong Liquors; and that many of both Sexes, who never tasted <HI>Punch,</HI> or indulg'd in any strong Liquor in their Lives, are afflcted with this Distemper; if this be true, and I have no reason to doubt my Infor∣mation, then this Distemper must
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>have some other Source than <HI>Punch.</HI></P>
<P>And if the <HI>Bath</HI> be the only Cure for this Distemper, as you boldly affirm it is; how comes it to pass, that so many are cured of it in the <HI>West-Indies?</HI> And tho' the meaning of your recommending the <HI>Bath,</HI> and of your Encomiums upon the <HI>Water,</HI> and other Conveniencies of that Place, upon several Occasions, is by no means Mysterious; yet you have rashly strain'd that Point too far in this Place, and it will never contribute to the End for which I believe you design'd it; for pro∣bably you never can have any Pa∣tients, under these Circumstances, but from the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> who at the same time they read your Re∣commendation of the <HI>Bath,</HI> to Save and Cure them, they will find your Mistake, in saying it is the only Re∣medy; since they all know, that many more are cured of it at Home, than ever came to the <HI>Bath</HI> to find Relief; and that going to a colder
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>Climate, never fails to produce a Cure of this Distemper, without taking any other Remedy.</P>
<P>And this Disease, is so far from always cutting them off in a few Days, that they who live soberly when they are so afflicted, generally recover in a very little Time; and it will hold those, who continue the excessive use of strong Liquors many Months, nay Years, before they are either kill'd by it, or cured of it. These things, which every Body in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> know to be true, will necessarily make them conclude, that you know nothing of the Na∣ture of this Distemper. And if this be true, your telling them that the <HI>Bath</HI> is their only Remedy, will hardly bring them there to become your Patients.</P>
<P>Besides we cannot suppose, with∣out reflecting upon the good Sense of these People, that they would indulge themselves in a Liquor so pernicious to them, as you think
<PB N="38" REF="41"/><HI>Punch</HI> is, when they have variety of other Liquors, that would answer all the Purposes of drinking.</P>
<P>This Disease that you ascribe to <HI>Punch,</HI> is I am told, the Effect of catching cold in that Country, which the sober People carefully guard a∣gainst; but those who use to intoxi∣cate themselves with strong Liquors, often neglect the proper Means to prevent taking cold, by sleeping sometimes in the open Air, or not taking the proper Care to avoid this ill, by Means that are necessary to be used within Doors. For tho' a Man is less apt to catch cold, when his Vessels are all turg'd with the Liquor that hath made him drunk; yet after some time, when the several <HI>Emunctory</HI>'s of the Body, have dis∣charged the superfluous Fluid from the Vessels, they will become more lank, and the Pores of the Skin will be more open, to admitt any nox∣ious Steams that may be in the Air, than they were before; and there∣fore,
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>a more than common Care, is requisite to prevent a Man's taking cold in this State. And if a Man catches cold there, after being drunk, he will be seized with this Distem∣per, whatever Liquor he debauch'd in. Indeed as all the Ingredients of <HI>Ruin-Punch,</HI> are the Product of that Country, they are consequently to he purchas'd very cheap, and for this Reason the poorer sort of Peo∣ple, and the Sailors that go thither (who are the Bulk of those who delight in drinking to Excess) often get the dry Belly-Ach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By catching cold, after being drunk with <HI>Punch.</HI> But since <HI>Punch</HI> is no more accessary to this Distemper, than any other strong Liquor, that a Man debauches in, and since so∣ber Persons who never tasted <HI>Punch,</HI> are subject to this Distemper, I think it very unreasonable, to attri∣bute this Mischief wholy to <HI>Punch.</HI></P>
<P>When you wrote your Essay of the <HI>Gout,</HI> &amp;c. You took a Fancy to
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>say, that the Nerves were solid without Cavities; and therefore contained no Fluid. This Notion, has led you into many extravagant Expressions, about the Condition of the Nerves; which this last Product∣ion of yours is crouded with. <HI>e g.</HI> What <HI>Idea,</HI> can be annex'd to that Expression (so often used by you) of <HI>Bracing,</HI> and <HI>Winding</HI> up the Nerves? Every one knows how a Drum is braced, and how a Fiddle string is wound up; but how those Operations can be applied to the Nerves, in any part of the <HI>Animal</HI> Body, is what I am sure no Man can imagine.</P>
<P>In your Treatise of the <HI>Gout,</HI> &amp;c. you have these Words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay of the Gout, Page 91.</NOTE> <Q>"I have a long time suspected the reason∣ings of <HI>Physicians,</HI> and the Ac∣counts given by them of the Na∣ture of Diseases, that were found on <HI>Nervous</HI> Juices, and <HI>Fluids,</HI> their Motion, Nature, and Qualities: And yet it will be
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>a great Baulk on the <HI>Theory</HI> of Distempers, the boasted <HI>Politeness,</HI> and admired <HI>Fineness</HI> of the pre∣sent Age has advanced, should there really be no such Fluids in <HI>Animal Body's".</HI></Q> This, as you ob∣serve, wou'd have been no small Sur∣prise to the learned World; and I'll tell you anotherthing, (which perhaps you do notknow) it wou'd have been no small Addition to their Surprise, to have found that you had made the Discovery.</P>
<P>Now, tho' the Arguments you bring to support your Opinion, that the Nerves contain no Fluid, are of such a Nature, that it may seem trifling to take Notice of them, yet I shall be at some Pains with the last thing you say in defence of this Notion; because I presume you brought it thus in the Rear, as thinking it the strongest and most conducive to your Purpose. The Sum of this last Argument is, be∣cause the Nerves are <HI>Cylindrical</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>Tubes, whereas the Arteries and Veins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which evidently con∣tain Fluid are <HI>Conical,</HI> and Nature being uniform in her Operations, therefore you conclude, that the Nerves contain no Fluid.</P>
<P>The Arteries by dividing into Branches, must grow gradually nar∣rower, and for that Reason are <HI>Con∣ical;</HI> and the Nerves are <HI>Cylinders</HI> because they do not communicate with one another, but run on in se∣parate Canal's, from their Origines to their Extremities.</P>
<P><HI>And the Wisdom of our Creator is signaly manifested in contriveing the Structure of the Nerves, different from that of all the other Vessels in the</HI> Ani∣mal <HI>Body. For as the Nerves do not communicate with one another, but run on in separate Canal's from their O∣rigins to their Extremities: An im∣pulse, or addition of Fluid, to any Quantity of Nerves, determin'd to move a Muscle or Muscles, runs on, or is propagated to their Extremities,
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>without communicating their additio∣nal Fluid, or Impulse, to any of the other Nerves; which cou'd not happen, if their Structure was like that of the Arteries: For if the Nerves that serve in bending and extending of a Limb, were Branches from a common Trunk, with which they had a Communication, any impulse at the Trunk, would be propagated equally to all the Branches, the Benders and Extenders. So that instead of regular and voluntary Mo∣tions, we should be Distorted with Convulsions.</HI> e. g. <HI>Suppose a Power at</HI> A. <HI>determining to</HI>

<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
<P>This Demonstration, I have bor∣rowed from a System of <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> that is not yet published; I wish when it is, it may be effectual, to put an End to all that unintelli∣gible Babbling, which hath hitherto confounded this useful Knowledge.</P>
<P>It is no difficult Matter to con¦ceive, how the Fibres may be con∣tracted, by increasing the Quantity of Fluid in the Vessels which they compose. But by what power in Nature,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Essay of the Gout.</NOTE> can the Fibres be drawn in, and sink into their own Substance? which you say is the Case in Mus∣cular Motion. You are realy so unhappy in all your Expressions, that regard the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> that if I was not certain, you live by the <HI>Trade</HI> of Physick, I should Imagine you wrote purposely to turn it into Redicule.</P>
<P>This SIR, is a very incredulous. Age we live in; and these <HI>Infidels,</HI> whom Providence hath favoured
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>with Knowledge and Understand∣ing, will never regard an Opinion, without good Reasons to support it, be it never so boldly Asserted. So obstinate are they in their Aversion to Folly, that a Man who Speaks and Writes without thinking, may babble and scribble from his <HI>Cradle</HI> to his <HI>Grave,</HI> without meeting any other Recompence, but <HI>Redicule</HI> for his Pains. And by this Means, they vainly imagine to restrain the Folly of Writing and Speaking at ran∣dom; I say vainly imagine it, be∣cause <HI>you know</HI> it is attempting an Impossibility.</P>
<P>To be <HI>humbly Proud,</HI> is no new Character, and yet I believe you may justly boast, that no Body ever came up to it so fully as you have done; a singular <HI>Ambition,</HI> peculiar to your self, hath made you (upon some Occasion or other) reject e∣very Opinion, that has been com∣monly received in that Way, you wou'd fain perswade the World
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>you was Bred in; yet when Oc∣casion serves, you can truckle to any Opinion that ever was invented in that Way. And at the same time you are denying and despising the most reasonable Notions, of the best Physicians, you condescend to ex∣press your self, in all the unintelli∣gible <HI>Jargon</HI> of the <HI>Mountebanks</HI> (tho' I presume they are your Aver∣on, for the same reason that they hate one another) and treat us with whole Pages of uncouth Words and Phrases, with as much meaning, as the wandring Orator delivers them from the Stage. This Method may get you the Applause of the Igno∣rant who are always fond of what they do not understand; and they being the greatest part of Mankind, and generally the richest, you may advance by it, what the unthinking herd of Man, mistake for Interest: but sure <HI>you</HI> can be under no neces∣sity of stooping to such meanness!
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>tho' <HI>Quackery,</HI> like <HI>Thieving,</HI> is not always prompted by Necessity.</P>
<P>Your fondness of Novelty, which you have in common with all those, who do not know how to judge right∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of things, made you assert (what a great Man only suggested, and was far from being positive about it) that the Nerves were solid, and con∣tain'd no Fluid. I have already taken Notice of your Intention to be Witty, upon the resigned modern Opinion, as you are pleased to call it. And shall not repeat it again. But when it is convenient for you, to make your favourite<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay of the Gout</NOTE><HI>Bath-Water</HI> do every thing, by ascribing Qualitys to it, directly opposite to one ano∣ther, or which is the same thing making it have effects directly con∣trary; you thought (pardon me if I mistake in saying so) that it was necessary, to fall in with the very Opinion, that you had but a few Pages before, condemn'd with the greatest Contempt.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
<P>And then you say, that the Re∣laxation of the Muscles n Palsies, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> proceeds from Obstructions in the Nerves; for how can the Nerves be obstructed if they contain no Fluid?</P>
<P>The desire of Knowledge, is a very laudable Quality as any human Nature can boast of; But he who en∣deavours, to grasp at the Knowledge of a Thing, beyond the reach of his Capacity, and notwithstanding this, will pretend to all the Know∣ledge of it, that a <HI>Genious</HI> equal to the Task, could possibly arrive at; is a Character much of a Piece with him, who describes foreign Coun∣tries, and the particular Qualities of Great Persons, as if he had been most intimately acquainted with them, when he never possibly cou'd have access to know any thing a∣bout them, but what publick Fame, gave him in common with all Man∣kind; and all this from the Vanity of being thought a Man of Conse∣quence,
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>and not ignorant of what any Body would desire to know. That there are many such Charact∣ers in the World, is a melancholy Truth beyond Contradiction; and the despicable appearance they make Society when detected, is obvi∣ous to every Man of Sense.</P>
<P>You prescribe Exercise indefinitely to all Mankind, as if rest was never necessary, and Exercise never hurt∣ful. That Exercise is an excellent Remedy in some Cases, to restore and preserve Health is very true; but what Rules have you laid down, or could you lay down, to teach all Men, what kind and quantity of Exercise is proper for them all, un∣der their several Circumstances to to take. And it is impossible, for Men Ignorant of the Nature of their Constitutions, and of any Bodily Distemper, they may happen to la∣bour under, to judge aptly for themselves in this matter.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
<P>When you come to mention the Use of <HI>Opium,</HI> you acknowledge, that Physicians are the only proper Judges, when, and in what Quan∣tity it is to be exhibited; now as one great Effect of this Medicine, is to calm and dispose Men to rest, which is the Opposite of Exercise; does it not follow, that they must likewise, be the only Judges of the Quantity of Exercise, that Men should take? For when it is fit for Men to be quiet, then most cer∣tainly it is fit for them to leave off Exercise; and of Consequence, if Men who are not Physicians cannot Judge for themselves of the one, they cannot possibly determine the proper Seasons, and Quantity of the other.</P>
<P>In another Place, you seem to give your Assent to what I have been alledging in plainer Terms, where you say,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 27</NOTE> from these gene∣ral Rules, <HI>taking in the particular Complexions and Habits,</HI> &amp;c. Here
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>you seem to make it necessary, to have regard to the particular Cir∣cumstances of People, in order to prescribe justly for them. But who are to be the Judges of these parti∣cular Circumstances? Must these essential things be left to the Dis∣cretion of Men, who cannot possibly have any knowledge of them? The Practice of Physick SIR, is a sharp Edged-Tool, and seldom or never fails of having very ill Consequen∣ces, when put into unskillful Hands.</P>
<P>To show you how consistant you are with your self; in your <HI>Essay of the Gout,</HI> &amp;c. where you treat of Bathing, you say,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay of the Gout, Pag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 57.</NOTE> <Q>'<HI>If People will bath indifferantly without Advice, without duly preparing their Bodies, and cleansing the Alimentary-Passages without any distinct knowledge of their Case, their Strength, the proper Sea∣son of Bathing, or the Time they ought to stay in at once; there must neces∣sarily
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>happen (as there have hap∣pen'd) unlucky Accidents, which tend to discourage and disgrace bathing in General.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>And a little further in the same Treatise, you say<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Essay of the Gout, Page 65:</NOTE> <Q>'<HI>It is impossible to lay down a general Rule about the Quantity of</HI> Bath-Water, <HI>which it is convenient to drink daily; that be∣ing to be varied, according to some Circumstances of the Patient, and the Nature of the Distemper.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>When we consider these Passages, together with your <HI>Essay of Health,</HI> we find that at the <HI>Bath,</HI> People ig∣norant of Physick, must not pretend to act for themselves, and must be directed in every step they take, by the Advice of a Physician. But every where else; your general Rules are sufficient to guide them without any other Assistance.</P>
<P>If you had not some private Rea∣sons to conceal it, it wou'd be some satisfaction to know for what reason,
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>you have excluded the People at the <HI>Bath</HI> from the benefit of your general Rules? Is it not as easy to give Di∣rections for bathing and drinking the <HI>Bath-Water,</HI> under Circumstances that you are not acquainted with, as to direct People any where else in their Diet and Medicine, whose Con∣stitutions you are equally a Stranger to? Or wou'd you have us under∣stand by this, that People had better trust to their own Management, than to the Advice of any Physician, except just in that Place where Dr. CHEYNE, is to be consulted with?</P>
<P>I do not know how you may have succeeded in this way, but I think you are by far less artful in your Addresses to the Publick, than<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For let us our Brethren the <HI>Quacks</HI> brag what we will.—<HI>Tollere nodosam nescit Midicina padagram.</HI>

<P>And here (pardon the Compari∣son) like the Dog in the Fable, you drop the Substance to snatch at the Shadow; and when you intend to make a Monopoly of all the Pract∣ice in the Kingdom to your self, you are industrious to lose what you have already got; for notwith∣standing all the fine Things you have said of the <HI>Bath,</HI> who do you think will be at the Expence and Trouble of going thither, and where, to add to that Expence, they must fee a Physician, to regulate them, according to the various Circum∣stances of their Constitutions? When every where else with the Assistance of your Rules only, they can act for themselves, without being be∣holden to any Physician.</P>
<P>Give me leave to observe by the by, that you give a very extraordi∣nary Latitude in taking <HI>Opium;</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>when you say,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 219</NOTE> <Q>"That they who in the Opinion of the World, have died of too much <HI>Opium,</HI> cou'd not have liv'd many Days without it":</Q> And yet where you decry the Excessive use of Drams, you tell us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> they will as certainly kill as <HI>Laudanum</HI> or <HI>Arsenick;</HI> now if <HI>Laudanum</HI> can certainly kill, how are you certain, that no Body was ever killed by it, since it is a Drug so much in use, and which every Man hath access to at his Pleasure? A Man that hath murder'd another, may as reasonably urge in his de∣fence, that the Person he destroyed cou'd not possibly have lived many Days, though he had avoided that Fate.</P>
<P>Your 7th Chap. contains Rea∣soning of a very extraordinary Na∣ture: There you are pleased to say<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 213</NOTE> <Q>"Pain Constricts, Crisps up and shortens the <HI>Animal</HI> Fibres, it acts like a Wedge in tearing and rending, and dividing, those small
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>Filaments; it does to them what the Points of Salts do to all <HI>Ani∣mal</HI> Substances, which are to be preserved for Food, <HI>viz.</HI> hard∣ens, stiffens, and contracts them. The Fibres of live <HI>Animals</HI> being Contractile, Tonick, and springy when a hard pointed Body enters them (which is the Case in all bodily Pain) the parts by their contractile Nature, fly from, re∣cede as much as possibly they can the wounding Instrument; this appears from the large gash of a Wound, made across the Fi∣bres of a Muscle; in the conti∣nual bending to the other Side, when any Part of us is pain'd; in the Cramps and Convulsions, nay, and sometimes Fevers pro∣duced by intense acute Pain. Pleasure on the contrary, relaxes the Fibres by a soft and Bland (or as the Mathematicians speak) a Commensurate and Harmonious Touch, it acts on the Fibres as
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>two unison and concordant Mu∣sical Instruments act on one an∣other; and by stroaking, softning, and smoothing, comes at last in∣tirely to relax and unbend them. The Parts of the Fibres run after, follow, and pursue, and at last break their Union in some degree to reach such a demulcent touch."</Q></P>
<P>Wou'd not any one that impli∣citly believed in you, imagine from this passage, that every individual <HI>Animal Fibre,</HI> was a rational Being, and had the Power of discerning at a distance, what was convenient or hurtful to it? Since you say they fly from a destructive Object, and pursue that from which they can receive Benefit. And if your Ar∣gument of the great Gash in a Mus∣cle, from the Fibres being cut trans∣versly, be of any weight, they must out-live the Person to whom they belong; for the same thing happens in the Muscles of a dead Body, a considerable Time after Life is ex∣tinguished.
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>This is a Circumstance very well known to all those, who have studied <HI>Anatomy,</HI> in that me∣thod by which the Knowledge of it can only be attained.</P>
<P>When one winds up a Fiddle string till it breaks, does not the two Ends fly back in the same man∣ner, as the Fibres of a Muscle when cut transversly? Here, contrary to your <HI>Chimera,</HI> the broken Ends of the String retreat from one another to∣wards the destructive Powers that divided it. And this will happen to every <HI>Elastick Fibre,</HI> whether you cut it, or extend it till it breaks.</P>
<P>The Muscles in all live Bodies, even in what we call their relaxed State, are in some measure Inflated and their Fibres endure a proporti∣onable degree of Tension, for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were not inflated they could not be extended, and if they were not<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Fibrae nullam habent Elasticitatem, nisi certa cam∣sint tens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<BIBL>S'Gravesand, <HI>de Elast.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> extended they wou'd not be
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>Elastick, and if they were not Ela∣stick the cut ends wou'd not recede from one another.</P>
<P>And in Muscular motion, tho' the Extremity's of the Muscles are brought nearer, yet we will find the length of the Fibres increased by this Action, if we consider them through all the Angles, made by the transverse Fibres which bind them together. And the Fibres of a <HI>Mus∣cle,</HI> being extended in Proportion as it is inflated, it is therefore, that exquisite pain is felt in violent Cramps and Convulsions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>If a Fibre'<HI>s</HI> being made longer, at the same time its Extremities are brought nearer, shou'd seem a pa∣radox to you; only consider what happens to a Bow-string, when one draws it to shoot off an Arrow; in this Action, tho' the two Ends of the String are brought nearer, yet the length of it will be increased, in proportion to the resistance of the Bow, and the Power which draws the String.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
<P>What we call (but very impro∣perly) bodily pain, never happens but when the Fibres are extended beyond their Natural length; and for that reason, an Incision made with a blunt Instrument, ragged in the Edge, gives more pain, than that which is made with one that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>harp and smoother; because the first draws the Fibres a greater length, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore it can divide them, than the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t. And hence it is, that in <HI>Am∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ations</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y always with a sharp Instrument carefully separate the <HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m</HI> from the Bone, where the Saw is to be apply'd, to avoid the painful Tension of its Fibres, by the Teeth of the Saw.</P>
<P>And when such Pain is produced from an internal Cause, it happens from the Obstruction of some part of the <HI>Animal Fluid,</HI> by which means the Vessels in that part swell, and the Fibres which compose their Sides, are stretch'd and in danger of being broke, and tore assunder,
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>in proportion to the increase of the obstructed Fluid. And the Intense∣ness of the Pain increases with the Tumor. Are not the Fibres ex∣tended in the Tumor, while an Ab∣scess is forming? And in the Case o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an Exostosis, does not the Tumor of the Bone, extend the Fibres of the <HI>Periostium?</HI> Is it not from the Tension then, and not from the Crisping up of the Fibres, as you Term it, that these Diseases cause Pain? These things are so well known to every one, who deserves the Name of a Physician, that I am sorry I shou'd have occasion to men∣tion them to you.</P>
<P>But you are positive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 215</NOTE> <Q>"That Pain most certainly crisps up, con∣stricts and contracts the <HI>Animal Fibres":</HI></Q> Now if the Fibres are sometimes shortn'd and crisp'd up, as you call it, and if it be a Disease, then according to you, the Pain must precede the Disorder, but how pain shou'd exist by it self without
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>a Disease to produce it, is what I dare say no body can imagine. What is commonly called bodily Pain, as I take it, (and I believe I speak the sense of every reasonable Man) is a disagreeable Sensation, arising from some Disorder in the <HI>Animal Machine;</HI> it is often the Consequence, but never can be the Cause of any Disorder.</P>
<P>What I have said, I think suffi∣ciently shows, how far your Know∣ledge in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> ex∣tends; as to your Skill in <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> every Apothecary that reads the Receipt of your Cordial, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may determine. And that no Man can be quallified for a Physician, that is ignorant of both or any of these, I may venture to affirm, is a Truth as evident as any Proposition in <HI>Euclid.</HI></P>
<P>Nor have you succeeded better in you Philosophical Dissertation upon the Passions, you say,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Page 152</NOTE> <Q>"Passion may be defined, the Sentiments pro∣duced
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>on the Soul, by external Objects, either Spiritual ones im∣mediately, or Material ones, by the mediation of the Organs of the Body".</Q> Now how can the Soul perceive any thing from out∣ward Objects, without receiving some impression from them? And how can such impressions get access to our Minds, but by the mediation and avenues of our Senses? And are not all the Organs of our Senses bodily Organs?</P>
<P>You tell us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 153</NOTE> <Q>"The acute Passi∣ons whether pleasurable or pain∣ful have much the same effect, and work after the same manner as acute Diseases do, they effect a brisk and lively Circulation of the Fluids, crisp up and constrict the Solids for some time. Thus sudden gusts of Joy or Grief, Pleasure or Pain, stimulate and spur the nervous Fibres, and Coats of the <HI>Animal Tubes;</HI> and thereby give a celerity and brisker
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>motion to their included Fluids".</Q> There is something so extravagantly wild in this Notion (tho' you have often express'd your self much to the same Purpose) that I am truly at a loss what Answer to make to so odd a proportion <HI>viz.</HI> that the Perceptions and Sensations of the Mind fly about the Body in the form of a palpable Fluid, which contains hard and pointed Bodies; for such they must be, to stimulate the Fibres in the manner you contend for.</P>
<P>That a great part of the nervous Fluid is govern'd by the affections of the Mind, is evident from the Bodily motions which depend upon the Will. And as the <HI>Mind</HI> is dif∣ferently affected, it may no doubt restrain or increase the flow of this Fluid to the detriment of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy.</HI> But you af∣firm that these very Sensations and Affections of the <HI>Mind,</HI> which we term Pain and Pleasure (not as they prevail upon the <HI>Mind</HI> to act upon
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>its Organs,) but act as Solids them∣selves, to Destroy or Preserve us. And thus you say the Sensations of the <HI>Mind</HI> create <HI>Bodily Fain.</HI></P>
<P>But all Sensations, whether plea∣sant or painful, exist no where but in the <HI>Mind,</HI> and however it be common to call that disagreeable Sensation, which arises from any Disorder in the <HI>Animal Organs, Bo∣dily Pain,</HI> to distinguish it from o∣ther painful Affections of the <HI>Mind,</HI> which do not proceed from that Cause; yet in <HI>Philosophical Reason∣ing,</HI> no Phrase nor Expression, shou'd be admitted, that is not strictly a∣greeable to Truth. And tho' the Soul readily perceives, when the Bo∣dy is either disorder'd, or better dis∣posed for performing the Functions necessary to <HI>Life and Health;</HI> yet the Organs themselves are incapable of any Sensation, and consequently there is no such thing in Nature as <HI>Bodily Pain;</HI> and therefore that Phrase ought never to be used, e∣specially
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>where close Reasoning is required.</P>
<P>But you seem to be of another Opinion, and tell us,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 163</NOTE> <Q>"That Beauty or Perfection gives plea∣sure to both Parts of the Com∣pound".</Q> That is to the <HI>Mind</HI> and its Organs; I thought there had not been a thinking Man in Being, who did not know, that the Organs of the Body were composed of meer Matter, and consequently incapable of any Sensation; and that Knowledge and Perception, can only exist in the <HI>Mind,</HI> and is the distinguishing Cha∣racter of it.</P>
<P>I have a better Opinion of you, than to believe you mean, what I think this Passage implys; for since Knowledge and Perception, are these essential Quallities of the Soul, which denote its existence; and since all things which are endued with the same Properties, must necessarily be of the same Species and Nature; why shou'd we then believe the Soul
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>immortal, if these Properties from whence we derive our belief of its Immortallity, are common to the Body which evidently perishes? Nor does the Absurdity of this No∣tion of yours end here, for when we consider it, with what you call the 4th <HI>Prop.</HI> of this Dissertation, we will find them amount to the most hideous <HI>Hypothesis</HI> that ever was imagin'd; equally shocking and repugnant to Reason: Your Words are these,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Page 149</NOTE> <Q>"As in Bodies there is a Principle of <HI>Gravity</HI> or <HI>Attract∣ion,</HI> whereby, <HI>in vacuo,</HI> they tend to one another, and wou'd unite according to certain <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Li∣mitations</HI> establish'd by the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature:</HI> So there is an <HI>Analo∣gous Principle</HI> in <HI>Spirits,</HI> whereby they wou'd as certainly, in their proper vacuity, be <HI>attracted</HI> by, <HI>tend</HI> to, and <HI>unite</HI> with one ano∣ther; and their first <HI>Author, Cen∣tre,</HI> and the <HI>Rock out of which they were hewn</HI> (to use a Scripture
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>Phrase) as the <HI>Planets</HI> wou'd to one another, and to the <HI>Sun</HI>". &amp;c.</Q> Now if the Soul be to the <HI>Supreme Power,</HI> as the Stone is to the Rock from whence it is hewn, then the Soul must be of the same Nature and Species with GOD himself; and not only this; but if the Pro∣perties of the Soul are common to the Body (as you have said they are) then not only the Soul, but the <HI>Supreme Power</HI> it self, must be of the same Nature with the Body, which every Days Experience shows us, is <HI>Finite</HI> and <HI>Corruptible.</HI> But as this pretended Reasoning of yours cou'd only be the produce or a per∣plexed imagination, it deserves Pity rather than Reprehension; and a Man must be divested of all Regard to the dignity of <HI>Human Nature,</HI> to be able to read it, without having Compassion for the Author.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Page 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> You desire the Tender and the Valetudinary to guard against Pas∣sion: You may as well propose to
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>cure a Man of a Fever by bidding him be well; for as the Passions of the <HI>Mind</HI> depend upon the Habit and Constitution of the Body, a Man whose Habit of Body, natura∣ly produces these Emotions we call Passions, can as well hinder his Pulse to beat, as suppress them, till that Habit which gives them Birth is changed: Indeed there may some∣times such means be used, as will al∣ter in some measure this untoward Habit, and give a Man considerable relief, and make him less subject to these miserable Disorders; yet there being great variety of Causes, which produce these Ills upon the <HI>Minds</HI> of Men; to prescribe a Method for curing this Ill, without knowing the true Cause, it will be so far from having an equal Chance of bringing about the desired Effect, that there will be as many Odds against it, for making the Case more desperate, as there are Causes more than one capable of producing the Distemper.</P>

<P>If you or any Body should think me too severe, and alledge in your behalf, that however faulty your Performance may be, yet since you did your best, Mankind are still oblig'd to you for your Endeavours. I wou'd ask you, or any that wou'd plead in this manner for you, if you were to purchase any thing for your conveniency, that you cou'd not be a competent Judge of, till you had tried it; and if a Person whose In∣tegrity you depend upon, should sell you that which is damaged and good for nothing, for the very best of its Kind; and suppose the Pre∣servation or Loss of your Life, or Health, depended upon the differ∣ence; I wou'd, I say, ask how far this Man's telling you, it was the best he had to dispose of, would serve to preserve his Credit with you?</P>
<P>I would not here be misunder∣stood, and supposed to write this for the Benefit of Physicians, who I look upon generally Speaking, to

And I believe it wou'd be better for the World, that the Practise of Physick was quite abolished; for tho' many wou'd suffer in wanting these helps that they might receive from the Hands of able Physicians, yet I am perswaded their number wou'd be so small, in proportion to those who are daily tortur'd and murder'd, by ignorant Pretenders to that <HI>Art,</HI> that People in general wou'd receive great benefit and relief by being freed from so great a Curse as Physicians gene∣rally are,</P>
