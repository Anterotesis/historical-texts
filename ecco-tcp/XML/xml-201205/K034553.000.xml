<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fifth Edition of this little Book being sold off, and the Bookseller calling on me to reprint it, I quickly determined to look it over carefully for that End; and what did not a little conduce to my publishing it again so readily, was, the favourable Reception the former Editions met with from the Publick, who were so indulgent as to esteem it a plain honest Account of the Distempers it treats of, and (what I my self have not Vanity enough to think) more to the purpose than any thing wrote before.</P>
<P>THE great Experience also I have had (since I first published this little Book) of the Method I re∣commended in it as most rational for the Cure of the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbiness</HI> and <HI>Leprosy,</HI> was anothor Motive of my venturing it again into the World; for I can truly say my Suc∣cess in Curing Cutaneous Diseases (having been ex∣ceedingly great, greater perhaps than many can easily believe) is a thorough Confirmation of the Efficacy of the Method I have mentioned to use, and by which I have restored abundance of People to perfect Health, who from the inveteracy of the Disease, length of Time they had been afflicted, and from their having often tried other Means in vain, almost despaired of ever being Cured; of which I could give many In∣stances of Men of Worth and Probity, were it proper.</P>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>I have added at the latter End, an Index to the whole, that those who have not Leisure or Inclination to begin and read the Book quite through (which yet is much the best way) may however, by looking over That, know what it contains, and turn to the Page they think most likely to inform them, of what they want chiefly to be acquainted with.</P>
<P>THE Index, considering the smallness of the Book it self, may be thought strange by some, it being as large as what is commonly found to a Book of six times the Bulk of this; but their wonder will cease, when the consider that this <HI>Short Account,</HI> under some Authors Pens, would have swell'd perhaps to more than six times its bigness, without containing more in Fact, than it does now. For my part, I think the fewer Words a Man expresses his Thoughts in, the bet∣ter, provided he can be clearly understood; for to use more, or be prolix in Writing, serves only, in my Opi∣nion, to puzzle the Cause, or amuse the Reader.</P>
<P>BUT whosoever Writes and Publishes his Thoughts upon any Subject to the World, would be vain in the last degree, should he expect every one would approve of them; the most Correct Books in all Arts and Sci∣ences, have ever met with ill-natur'd and unjust Censure from some, which indeed is no wonder, since <HI>Holy Writ</HI> it self has not escaped the Ridicule of Profligate Wretches; it is truly said, unhappy is that Person of whom every one speaks well, alluding that there never was or can be such a one, and in that Sense we may say, Vile and Contemptible is the Book, which every body likes: The Man therefore who sets Pen to Paper, in order to communicate any thing to
<PB REF="4"/>the Publick, ought first to resolve to bear unmov'd, all the Calumny and invidious Reflections that Malice can invent.</P>
<P>THIS I fully determin'd when I began the follow∣ing Treatise, and shall be altogether unconcerned for the Success it meets with amongst the cavilling part of Mankind.</P>
<P>I have given my Thoughts freely on the <HI>Itch,</HI> in∣veterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbiness</HI> and <HI>Lepro∣sy,</HI> under one or other of which, almost all Cuticular Eruptions, that are not the immediate Effects of acute Diseases, may be comprised; I thought it need∣less in this <HI>Short Account</HI> to treat particularly of <HI>Tetters, Ringworms,</HI> &amp;c. more especially since the Medicines that will Cure the <HI>Itch,</HI> &amp;c. will likewise Cure them, and most, if not all, other De∣filements of the Skin that take their Rise from Chronick Distempers.</P>
<P>I am not so opinionated of my own Performances, as to imagine that what I have written is without fault; yet I hope the Candid and Benevolent Rea∣der will take what I have done in good Part.</P>
<P>HE that writes his Sentiments of any Distemper, or concerning any Matter or Thing, with unfeigned Sincerity, is, in my Opinion, excusable, tho' he may not be wholly free from Error, and tho' a great Mo∣tive of it may be Self-Interest <HI>viz.</HI> gaining Honours, or increasing his Substance; but those are truly blama∣ble, who to obtain either of these, publish to the World as solemn Truths, their own sprightly Inventions, which have no real Foundation, and which in Fact, they do not believe themselves.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>AND that such groundless Hypotheses are to be found among Physical Authors, and that plain deal∣ing is a Virtue not always to be met with, may be ga∣thered from the Works of Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> the most worth and sincere Physician <HI>Europe</HI> ever bred, who being importuned to write an History of Chronick Di∣stempers, complained of the difficulty of such a Task, in the following Words.</P>
<P><Q>'FOR among Physical Writers, if you except <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> and some very few others, scarce any Footsteps can be found whereby I might trace thro' these impassable Ways, obstructed with so many Difficulties; for the Lights and Helps which Authors promise, are rather <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> than true Lights; which rather misguide to Rocks and Preci∣pices, than direct for the finding the Genuine Me∣thod of Nature; for most of their Writings are built upon Hypotheses proceeding from their own Fancies; and the very <HI>Phoenomena</HI> of Diseases, of which the History of them consists, as they are described by these, are modelled in the same Shop of Suppositions, and the very Practice wherewith they undertake Diseases, (which is the certain Plague and Destruction of Mankind) is suited to this kind of <HI>Postulata,</HI> and not according to the Truth of the Thing, so reigning are these Mens Whimsies almost in every Page; and in the mean while the Directions of Nature are slighted.'</Q></P>
<P>WHAT this most Excellent Physician says is very much to be lamented; for to be swayed by an embrac'd Hypothesis, and to be insincere in what relates so
<PB REF="6"/>eminently to Life, and Health the greatest Blessing of it, must surely be highly Criminal, and in the last degree Barbarous.</P>
<P>IF I know my own Heart, I have wrote the fol∣lowing Pages with that Integrity that becomes an honest Man, and have given as plain and natural an Account of the Illnesses I have treated about, as I possibly could; for the rest I do not trouble my self, I pretend not to Correctness of Stile; all the use I know of Words, is to convey one Man's sense of Things to another, if therefore I can be understood, it is sufficient: This I am satisfied of, from very great Experience, that the Method I have described for the Cure of the Diseases the Title mentions, will, if they are curable, by Blessing of God, take Ef∣fect; and not only in them, but in the <HI>King's-Evil,</HI> and all <HI>Scrophulous,</HI> Cases also, in a very short Time, in proportion to the inveteracy of them, provi∣ded the Patients will follow Directions; and such of them who think fit to apply to me, may depend upon faithful and civil Treatment, as I am sure all who have been under my Care hitherto, will acknowledge they have found, from</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Description, Symptoms, Nature and dangerous Consequences of the <HI>Itch,</HI> particular <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbiness</HI> and <HI>Leprosy.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Itch</HI> is a filthy Distemper, in∣festing the External Parts of the Bo∣dy universally, but more particular∣ly the Joints, and between the Fin∣gers, commonly with Pustulous E∣ruptions raised upon the Scarf-Skin, by almost unavoidable scratching, occasioned thro' violent itching of the Parts; from these Pustulous Erup∣tions or little Bladders, when broke, there is∣sues a thin Crystalline Humour, which touch∣ing any other Part not yet infected, soon causes incessant itching, and upon scratching, more Bladders to arise.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<P>AND by this means the <HI>Itch,</HI> in whatever Part it begins first, is soon spread over the whole Body, and very remarkably fixes upon the Wrists, Hams, and especially between the Fingers, which peculiarly distinguishes a real <HI>Itch</HI> from that slight itching of the Body, many People are troubled with for a short time, commonly about the beginning of Winter, and in the Spring, occasioned only by Strait∣ness, or Constipation, of the Pores of the Skin, thro' change or coldness of the Season, and which mostly goes away, upon enlarging or opening the Pores again, either by proper Exercise, or the help of the Bagnio, without further Trouble, or Medicines; yet if it con∣tinues, it may lay the Foundation of a true <HI>Itch</HI> soon after to follow, as will be shewn hereafter.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Itch</HI> has continued long, and is become confirmed, the little Ulcerations en∣crease, and the clear Humour, contained in the little Bladders, degenerates to a porulent Matter, which still makes the Disease more Nauseous and Infectious.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the <HI>Itch</HI> appears in a dry form, without those Pustules before mention∣ed, and then the Scarf-Skin looks red, rugged or uneven, and when by long continuance it is grown inveterate, the Parts affected are co∣vered over with a dry kind of thin Scab, and this is the worst and most stubborn sort of <HI>Itch,</HI> which, as well as the moist kind before spoken of, if neglected, in length of
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>Time, turns to a foul <HI>Scabies</HI> or <HI>Scabbiness</HI> of the whole Body, quickly to be described.</P>
<P>THE moist <HI>Itch,</HI> tho' not so stubborn o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> virulent as the dry kind, yet, by means of its moisture, sooner and more easily communi∣cates its Infection to Sound Bodies.</P>
<P>AND so Contagious is the <HI>Itch</HI> of either sort, that lying in Bed with a Person troubled with it, or in the Sheets an itchy Person has lain in, or to wipe one's Hands with the same Cloth, or draw on a Glove such a Person has worn, or even to have Linnen washed with the Linnen of one afflicted with the <HI>Itch,</HI> is sufficient to catch the Distemper and as the Famous and Ingenious Dr. <HI>Willi.</HI> says, <Q>'Certainly the Infection of no one Dis∣ease is more easily and certainly propagated (the Plague only excepted) than this of the <HI>Itch.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>YET some Persons are much more subject to be infected with it than others; for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many there is a certain aptness to receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Diseases of this kind, and such Persons catc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it sooner than others, as Experience demon¦strates; which difference 'tis likely may hap∣pen through the Natural Structure of the External Pores of the Body, or their bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> larger in one Person than in another, so a to imbibe or receive the infecting Humou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sooner and more surely.</P>
<P>BUT when One Person in a Family o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House is infected with the <HI>Itch,</HI> it commonl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> runs thro' the whole, and especially seizes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>those who Eat, Drink and Lye, or are very conversant with the Person who has so acci∣dentally caught it; and thus the <HI>Itch</HI> is com∣municated from one Person, and one Family to another, by means of lying in strange Beds, by Children of different Families playing to∣gether, or by Servant Maids or Nurses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that have had this loathsome Disease, and come into Families before they are perfectly cured of it.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Itch</HI> is caught by Infection, the Scarf or outward Skin only, for some time, is infected, and the Blood not at all tainted with it, and then it may easily and quickly be cured by proper Medicines regularly ad∣minister'd.</P>
<P>BUT when it has been neglected long, and the little Ulcers have crept deeper, and touched the <HI>Cutis</HI> or real Skin, so that the infecting Humour penetrates the small Veins, and is circled about with the Blood, it soon contaminates its whole Mass, and all the other Juices of the Body, and then becomes con∣firmed, is more dangerous, and much more difficult to Cure.</P>
<P>SO also where it happens to aged People, and likewise if it is complicated with other Distempers, in which last Case it must be treated with the utmost Skill, for then the Circumstances of the Patient will not often admit of its being cured after the nearest manner, but require it to be managed with
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>great Care and Caution, and with a particular regard to the other Illnesses that afflict the Patient; who otherwise may be kill'd instead of being cured, as in another Case hap∣pen'd to a certain Person labouring under a Consumption of the Lungs and the <HI>Venereal</HI> Disease together, the Person he apply'd to for Cure imprudently put him into a Salivation for the latter, without minding the former, and so destroy'd him; for which he was deservedly Prosecuted in a Court of Justice.</P>
<P>SOME Authors, Antient and Modern, are of the Opinion, that when the <HI>Itch</HI> has con∣tinued many Months together, and got into the whole Habit of the Body, it cannot be cured; but with Submission, I must dissent from them, being satisfy'd from my own Ex∣perience, that the most inveterate <HI>Itch</HI> may be perfectly and safely cured, by the Rational Method recommended in the latter Part of this Book, of which I also flatter my self my Readers will be convinced.</P>
<P>YET that an inveterate <HI>Itch</HI> is much more difficult to Cure than a slight one, is most certain, and Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> before-mentioned, speaking of some of his Patients that were afflicted with the <HI>Itch,</HI> which proved so stub∣born, that with the most powerful Remedies, and even repeated Salivations, he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cure, tells us, that <Q>'The Veneral Disease tho' it be extreamly Malignant, and cause<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most foul Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oethick Ulcers that Eat th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>Flesh and Bones, may more easily and cer∣tainly be cured than the <HI>Itch.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>ANOTHER Author, writing upon this Distemper, has the following Words, <Q>'I knew three Brothers, all young Men, die purely of the <HI>Itch,</HI> which by length of Time be∣coming habitual, at last corrupted the whole Body, which with putrid and eating Ulcers destroyed them.'</Q></P>
<P>AND thus we find Authors believe this Disease when grown inveterate, by being neg∣lected too long, to be not only Incurable, but Mortal; but with them I cannot agree, for in my Opinion, the Disease that kill'd the Three Brothers the last quoted Author men∣tions (judging by the latter part of his own Words) was rather a confirmed and univer∣sal <HI>Scabbiness</HI> properly the <HI>Itch</HI> it self, which I believe never proves Mortal till it turns to a loathsome <HI>Scabbiness,</HI> which indeed many times brings on Death.</P>
<P>HOWEVER certain it is, that there is a vast Difference in this Distemper, it being much harder to Cure in some Persons than in others; the Reason of which seems very plain, and my Experience every Day confirms it more and more, to be generally speaking thus, That those in whom it proves stubborn, are themselves the occasion of it; for when they first find they have caught the <HI>Itch,</HI> instead of
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>applying instantly to an ingenious Physician for a regular Cure, as they ought to do, they tamper with it themselves, and neither take and use trifling Remedies, so as to let the Disease gain ground of it self, or else more mischievous ones, so as hastily to fix it in the Blood and Juices, by which, of course, it becomes very stubborn and inveterate.</P>
<P>AN Example of which I very lately met with in a Tradesman, who having caught the <HI>Itch,</HI> follow'd the Advice of a Woman and other unskilful Persons, and also by using se∣veral Pretended Infallible Remedies, on his own Head, had so ingag'd the Disease, fix'd it in all his Fluids, and render'd it so very stub∣born and inveterate, that it was with much difficulty I overcame it, and perfectly Cured him.</P>
<P>ONE would admire that People should be thus infatuated to their own Detriment, and, as sometimes it proves, to their own Destructi∣on; but so it is, and that not only now and then, but very frequently; and what one would still more wonder at, I have almost daily Ac∣counts from Persons of the best Sense and Worth, who apply to me for Cure in those stubborn Cases, of their having injured them∣selves in this Manner, which I think, can pro∣ceed from nothing else, than that either they are asham'd to acquaint a Physician that they are troubled with such a Distemper, which is an Error, or else they imagine the <HI>Itch</HI> to be a Disease of little or no Consequence
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>and with Danger, which is a very great and sometimes fatal Mistake, as in the Course of these Papers, will be made apper.</P>
<P>BUT besides the Distemper commonly call'd the <HI>Itch,</HI> there are particular and in∣veterate <HI>Itching Humours</HI> of various Kinds or Appearances, that do not affect the Body universally as That does, but fix upon par∣ticular Parts only, as in some Persons upon the back of one or both of the Hands, in others upon the Shoulders or Arms, and in others upon one or both of the Thighs, or some other particular Parts, either of the Head, Face, Body or Limbs, many times about as broad as a Man's Hand; but some Persons have them much broader, and others much narrower; and in whatever Parts they first appear, they mostly continue, sometimes di∣minishing and sometimes increasing, in respect both to largeness in inveteracy, for many Months and oftentimes Years together, un∣less prudently managed and perfectly Cured, by Internal as well as External Reme∣dies.</P>
<P>NOW and then the inveterate <HI>Itching Hu∣mours</HI> of this kind in some Patients change their Station, and disappearing in the Parts they first affected, soon after arise in others; but this they seldom do, unless the Persons troubled with them, tamper with outward Applications, which, alone, are dangerous,
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>as will be made appear in the following Sheets.</P>
<P>THESE particular <HI>Itching Humours,</HI> in whatever Parts they shew themselves, make the Scarf-Skin look Red, Angry and Un∣equal, and besides the violent Itching that mostly attends them, little Pimples, upon scratching, commonly arise, that are very fore for a short time, and often send forth a thin Humour, that may be seen standing upon the Parts affected, almost like Dew, and when the Soreness abates, the Pimples diminish, and the Itching increases, and then little dry Scurf falls off, and fresh Pimples soon arise, so that there is unsufferable itching, and sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> soreness, almost at the same time, which proves exceeding troublesome to those unhap∣pily fatigued therewith.</P>
<P>THESE inveterate <HI>Itching Humours</HI> differ not much from the Disease, called <HI>Scabies</HI> or <HI>Scabbiness,</HI> excepting only that they confine themselves to particular Parts, as before shewn, and That mostly affects the Body universally</P>
<P><HI>SCABIES</HI> or <HI>Scabbiness,</HI> is a Disease most commonly succeeding an inveterate <HI>Itch</HI> either moist or dry, for when either kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has continued long, or been ill Cured, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the very Fountains of the Blood and Juices are corrupted, an inveterate and filthy <HI>Scabbiness,</HI> quickly follows, which not only affects the <HI>Cuticula</HI> or Scarf-Skin, as tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> does, but penetrates deeper, and fixes upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>the <HI>Cutis</HI> or real Skin, which it gnaws and ulcerates, and causes nastly Scabs to cover the Parts.</P>
<P>IF it follows the moist <HI>Itch,</HI> foul Ichorous Matter issues from them, which is very con∣tagious, and infects and found Part it touches; but if it succeeds the dry <HI>Itch,</HI> there is seldom any Pus issues from the Scabs, which then appear very crusty, dry and nauseous to the sight.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES a <HI>Scabbiness</HI> happens when the <HI>Itch</HI> has not gone before it, but this is not near so frequent as the <HI>Scabbiness</HI> following the <HI>Itch,</HI> which as before said, is generally a Preludium to this hateful Distemper.</P>
<P>A <HI>Scabbiness</HI> is also accompany'd with itch∣ing as well as soreness, especially about the Edges of the small Ulcers that void a foul cor∣rupted Pus in the moist kind, and about the crusty Scabs in the dry sort.</P>
<P>AN universal <HI>Scabbiness,</HI> as it is much worse than the <HI>Itch</HI> for Filthiness and Putre∣faction, so it is much more dangerous and difficult to Cure.</P>
<P>IF it continues long without being Cured, the Ulcerations increase in number as well as largeness, and the discharge of Matter from them is so great, the Humours continually flowing that way, that the Body being robb'd or drain'd of its moisture, falls of course into a Consumption, which, together with the fatigue the Patient undergoes in the Day time, and want of Rest and Sleep at Night, oc∣casioned
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>by continual alternate itching and smarting, quickly finishes the fatal Catastrophe, and the unhappy Patient is obliged to submit to a miserable Death.</P>
<P>BUT this must be understood only of the moist <HI>Scabbiness,</HI> for the dry one, tho' very Inveterate and Malign, yet seldom or never is attended with Death, but first ushers in a poisonous <HI>Leprosy,</HI> that, if not timely Cured, soon puts a Period to the Patient's Life.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Leprosy</HI> is the most Malignant Distem∣per that affects the External Parts of the Body, the Blood and Juices being contaminated with its fatal Poison, whence proceeds the great Difficulty of curing it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Leprosy</HI> is sometimes the Hereditary Disease of the Family, but is much more com∣monly contracted by Infection.</P>
<P>AND it may indeed be termed, as in the Learned Dr. <HI>Blancard</HI>'s Physical Dictionary, a Disease, by which, <Q>'The Temperature, Form, and Figure, and at last the very Continuity of the Body is corrupted; <HI>and as he again says,</HI> 'Is a Canker commonly to the whole Body.'</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Itch</HI> and <HI>Scabies</HI> are usually the Fore∣runners of it, for the <HI>Itch,</HI> being neglected, turns to an universal <HI>Scabies,</HI> and That to the <HI>Leprosy</HI> as before shewn, which is the worst of Cutaneous Diseases, and accompanied with the highest degree of Corruption and Putre∣faction.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
<P>THE Symptoms accompanying this direful Disease, are both Internal and External con∣cisely summ'd up as follow:</P>
<Q><P>'THE Internal are Acid or Musty Belch∣ings, Costiveness, Thirst, a stinking Sweat, thick Urine, insomuch, that the Powder of Lead will swim upon it; an extream propen∣sity to Venery; thickness, viscosity, and unctuosity of the Blood when drawn forth, and little Clots of Sand sticking to the Cloth thro' which it is strained; stinking Breath, a weari∣ness of the Limbs, Chilness, Stupidity, and a hoarse Voice, as if it came thro' the Nose.'</P>
<P>'THE External Symptoms are these, the Skin appears livid, black or yellow; it wrinkles when exposed to the Cold; it is notably rough and oily, insomuch, that Wa∣ter will not stick to it; it is covered over with a Purple or white Dandriff; little moveable painless Knots and Swellings beset the Forehead, Chin and Joints; a dry Ring∣worm and Pushes cover the whole Body, and affect not only the Skin but the Muscles; an eternal <HI>Itch</HI> like the gnawing of Worms, or pricking with Needles molests 'em; when they scratch any Part, it turns dry and scaly, but voids no Matter; the Hair of their Head and Eyebrows falls of; their Forehead is furrowed with wrinkles; their Ears stretched and swelled; the Eyebrows callous and raised; their Eyes round red and sparkling, infested with little hard swel∣lings in the corners, and apt to water; the
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>upper Part of their Nose contracted, while the inferiour is enlarged, troubled with fre∣quent sneezing, and infested with a Polypus and Cancrous corrosive Ulcers; the Face and Lips are pale, hard, livid, and chop'd; their Tongue and Mouth liable to hard Swellings, Chops and Corrosion; the Gums rough and swol'n; the Spittle Viscous; their Breasts hard, and their Veins swol'n; the Joints wither'd, and beset with callous indolent Ulcers, that are apt to bleed upon the slightest touch; the Muscles of their Hands, especially those of the Thumb, and first Finger, are much consumed; the Fin∣gers and Toes benumb'd; the Joints distorted and knotty, and the Nails black, bowed and chopped.'</P></Q>
<P>THE Reader, I presume will readily allow, that Persons labouring under all these Symp∣toms, can have but small, if any hopes of Life, and indeed here are so many dreadful ones enumerated, that the very Thoughts of them, one would think, are sufficient not only to sink a Person Afflicted with them to the Grave, but also to make him desire a speedy Death, as a kind Relief to the grievous Mi∣sery he must necessarily endure.</P>
<P>BUT it must not be imagined, that every one affected with the <HI>Leprosy,</HI> is afflicted with all these Symptoms; some Persons are not troubled with one half of them, and yet are as surely <HI>Leprous</HI> as those labouring under the greatest part, or all, that have been summ'd up.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
<P>THE most distinguishing Sign of the <HI>Lepro∣sy,</HI> is the Fish like Scales, of a Branny Colour, that fall from the External Parts of the diseased Person; and whether that is attended with many more of the before-mentioned Symptoms, as it mostly is, or not, it bespeaks the <HI>Le∣prosy.</HI></P>
<P>THE sooner the Cure of this Distemper is undertaken, and the fewer the Symptoms are, the better it will be overcome, and the sooner and more certainly will the Patient be restored to Health; but if it be neglected for a consi∣derable time, till the Symptoms are multi∣pied, the Strength of the Patient much im∣paired, and the Disease arrived to the highest degree, it may then be said to be incurable, and the suffering Wretch has nothing more to do, than to settle his Worldly Affairs, com∣mit his Soul to God who gave it, and pati∣ently expect his Dissolution to put a final End to his intolerable Torment.</P>
<P>BY the Account and Description of the Symptoms, Nature and Danger of the Exter∣nal Diseases here given, I think it plainly ap∣pears how inexcusably remiss, and in the last degree negligent of themselves those Persons are, who being afflicted in the slightest man∣ner with Cutaneous Distempers, or such as affect the External Parts universally, omit to seek for a regular Cure in time, since it has been sufficiently proved, that the most trifling <HI>Itch,</HI> if neglected, becomes more and more inveterate, and advances step by step, from
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>one degree to another, till from the <HI>Itch</HI> it turns to an universal and nauseous <HI>Scabies,</HI> which many times kills the Patients unfortunnately troubled with it, and if it does not, turns to a loathsome <HI>Leprosy,</HI> that very often proves in∣curable, and fails not to render the unhappy Sufferers, and oftentimes their Posterity after them, miserable Spectacles to others, as well as lamentable Torments to themselves, and at last accomplishes their Destruction, by the unavoidable Death it certainly brings on.</P>
<P>AND no less imprudent are they, who being troubled with <HI>Tetters, Ringworms,</HI> and other breakings out, in particular Parts, neg∣lect to get Cured; for they are for the most part Species of one or other of the Diseases I have described, and are of very ill Consequence, if not quickly remedied.</P>
<P>I have not inlarged on those several breakings out, by their particular Names, as found in Authors, because, as they may be comprehend∣ed under the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabies,</HI> or <HI>Leprosy,</HI> which I have discoursed on I would neither tire the Reader's Patience, or swell these Papers beyond my first Intention.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Original Cause of the <HI>Itch,</HI> in∣veterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbi∣ness</HI> and <HI>Leprosy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT the External Diseases I treat of, are for the most part occasioned by In∣fection, is very certain, there being, I believe, scarcely One Person in Fifty troubled with them, but what were infected by others in the manner I have shewn in the foreging Chapter; yet as the communicating of them from one Person to another, cannot properly be called the Cause, but rather the spreading of Diseases before cau∣sed, I design here, passing over that, as sufficient∣ly proved and already known, to proceed to an enquiry after the Original Cause of those Cuta∣neous Distempers, when they arise and hap∣pen to Persons who have not been infected by, or received them from others, and that from the Opinions of some of the Ancient as well as Modern Physicians, many of whom assign the <HI>Itch, Scabies, Leprosy,</HI> &amp;c. to one and the same Cause, and are of Opinion that those Diseases differ from one another only in degree. Nevertheless it must be al∣low'd, that inveterate <HI>Itching Humours</HI> in par∣ticular Parts, are sometimes of a Scrophulous Nature, and proceed from the <HI>King's-Evil.</HI></P>
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
<P><HI>GALEN</HI> lays the fault of Diseases of the Skin on melancholy or adust Matter.</P>
<P><HI>AVICEN</HI> is of Opinion that, <Q>'Blood with which Choler is mixt, and that with Salt Flegm converted into Melancholy, is the cause of <HI>Scabbiness.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>LANGIUS</HI> accuses, <Q>'Impure Cholerick Blood, or adust and Faeculent, mixt with Li∣quor of Salt Flegm (produced by discracy of the Liver, and oftentimes obstruction of the Spleen) as the cause of the <HI>Itch.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>THE Learned Dr. <HI>Blancard,</HI> in his Phy∣sical Dictionary, says, the <HI>Leprosy</HI> is caused by <Q>'Black Bile diffused thro' the whole Body.'</Q></P>
<P>OTHERS are also of the Opinion, that the <HI>Itch</HI> proceeds from <Q><P>'Choler, subtilized and sent into the Habit of the Body, which be∣ing mixt with thin Salt Flegm, and spread∣ing into the Superficies of the Body, breaks out in the <HI>Cuticula</HI> with small watery Pu∣stules causing great Itching.'</P>
<P>'THAT a <HI>Scabbiness</HI> proceeds from Blood and Lympha defiled with Excrementitious Humours, not sufficiently separated and ex∣pelled by Urine, Stool, Sweat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that the Sanguineous and Lymphatick Juices must of necessity be corrupted with sharp and biting Humours, mixt with Salt Flegm and adust Choler.'</P>
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
<P>THAT the <HI>Leprosy</HI> is caused by 'Salt Flegm possibly putrified with a mixture of oily Humours, as a depraved Lympha and adust Choler.'</P>
<P>AND that the remote Causes of this De∣pravation of the Choler and Lympha, are 'Feeding upon Salt, Acrid and Hot Meats; also want of Cleanliness, or keeping the Body sweet and clean.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> believes the Cause of the <HI>Itch,</HI> &amp;c. to be the Depravation of the Humour of the Cutaneous Glands:</P>
<P><Q><P>'THE Glandulous Humour, <HI>says he,</HI> de∣praved either by the Blood being very im∣pure, and also dissolved, leaving its Cor∣ruption and Recrements plentifully in the Cutaneous Glands, which there assuming the Nature of a more Corrosive Ferment, does ferment and variously Coagulate with other Juices that come thither or pass that way, and so produces the <HI>Itch,</HI> &amp;c. or the Humour gathered in the Cutaneous Glands, some∣times by mere Stagnation, becomes not only Itchy but Corruptive. Therefore those kept long in Prison, or that lead a Sedentary Life, and are used to filth and stink, are Obnoxious to these Diseases.'</P>
<P>AGAIN, the same Author tells us, That in a <HI>Scabbiness</HI> and <HI>Leprosy,</HI> '<HI>Acido-Saline</HI> Con∣cretions (like Tartar in Wine) do happen in the Mass of Blood, which when they
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>cannot be conquered or dissolved, are dri∣ven to the Skin, as in the other Case, <HI>(viz. Wine)</HI> to the sides of the Cask.'</P></Q></P>
<P>THE Excellent <HI>Etmuller</HI> assigns the Cause of the <HI>Itch,</HI> to <Q><P>'Sharp Particles of the <HI>Serum,</HI> repairing to the Surface in small Quantities.'</P>
<P>OF a <HI>Scabbiness,</HI> to the 'Depravation of the Nutritive <HI>Serum,</HI> or Juice of the Parts under the Skin, occasioned by a Preternatural Acid, that takes its Rise from sudden Cold, succeeding Heat, and shutting up the Steams of the Body within the straitned Pores; and which by continuance may at last infect the Blood.'</P>
<P>HE also says, that 'A <HI>Scabbiness</HI> proceeds sometimes, but very rarely, from Internal Causes, as <HI>Scurvy, French-Pox,</HI> &amp;c.'</P>
<P>AND treating of the <HI>Leprosy,</HI> he gives his Opinion that it is caused by 'A Saline Cor∣rosive Acid reigning in the <HI>Serum.</HI>'</P>
<P>HE likewise ingeniously gives the Reason why Cutaneous Diseases are sometimes moist and sometimes dry, as follows:</P>
<P>'IF the Nutritive Juice be very serous and apt to corrupt, the Breakings out run much; if balmy and impregnated with a Volatile Oily Salt, they are crusty and dry.'</P></Q></P>
<P>BY what has been said, it appears how much Physicians differ from one another, concerning the Cause of those Cutaneous Distempers, but in my Judgment the two last quoted Authors
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>have hit the Mark much nearer than others, and their Opinions, which amount almost to one and the same thing, will appear more Ra∣tional, if what the accurate and learned Phy∣sician Dr. <HI>J. Keill</HI> says concerning the Scarf-Skin, in his Anatomy of the Human Body abridg'd, be consider'd; his Words follow:
<Q><P>'THIS <HI>(i. e. the Scarf-Skin)</HI> is that soft Skin which rises in a Blister upon any burn∣ing, or the application of a Blistering Plaister. It sticks close to the Surface of the true Skin, to which it is also tied by the Vessels which nourish it, tho' they are so small as not to be seen; when we examine the Scarf-Skin with a Microscope, it appears to be made up of several Lays of exceeding small Scales, which cover one another more or less, according to the different thickness of the Scarf-Skin in the several Parts of the Body. In the Lips where the Scales appear plainest, because the Skin is thinest, they only in a manner touch one another. Now these Scales are either the excretory Ducts of the Glands of the true Skin, as I think is apparent in Fishes, or else these Glands have their Pipes opening between the Scales.'</P>
<P>'THESE Scales are often glewed one to another by the grosser parts of our insensible Transpiration, hardening upon them by the Heat of our Body, which carries off the more Volatile Particles. The Humour which is afterwards separated by the Glands of the Skin, being pent in between the
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>Scales, causes frequent Itchings, and where the Matter has been longer pent up, small Pimples.'</P></Q> Thus far the Ingenious Dr. <HI>Keill.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if the Humour designed by Nature to be excreted, by being pent in, thro' Cold or any other Accident, causes frequent <HI>Itchings,</HI> and by a longer continuance, small Pimples, as certainly it does, why may it not be sup∣posed, according to <HI>Willis</HI> and <HI>Etmuller,</HI> that, by a yet longer Confinement or Stagnation, it will be depraved, become corruptive, and at last infectious, especially if the remote Causes, such as leading a Sedentary Life, eating Salt Meats, the Relicks of other Distempers, or liv∣ing in Nastiness or Filth, have obstructed or impaired the Glandules of the Body, or any way injured their Structure, and also caused irregular Cohaesions of Particles in the Blood and Juices, so as to make them apt upon the least Stagnation to Corrupt and Putrify?</P>
<P>MUCH might be said to strengthen and de∣fend this Opinion; yet after all the fine Spe∣culations and Notions Men have, and propa∣gate concerning the Original Cause of these and many other Diseases, it must be acknow∣ledged that it is doubtful, whether we can more than guess at the real Essence of them; and the most faithful Physician that ever wrote, the Immortal <HI>Sydenham,</HI> our Coun∣tryman, appears to have had the same Senti∣ments, when treating of another Distemper he tells us:</P>
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
<P><Q>'AS to the intrinsick Nature and Essence of this Disease, as they say, I count I am to seek for it no further than as it appears by the Symptoms we have described, no more than I am obliged to search into the Essence of any Plant or Animal.'</Q></P>
<P>THIS admirable Man being sensible, no doubt, of the insufficiency of Human Reason to penetrate into the Abstruse Principles or first moving Causes of Diseases, seems to have apply'd himself wholly to the Observation of Distempers, their several Symptoms, Stages and Terminations, together with the most Natural and Effectual Method of curing them, as his admirable Works, so justly valued all over <HI>Europe,</HI> shew.</P>
<P>AND it would be well if all Persons who Practise Physick, and who have the good of Mankind most at Heart, would Copy after the Learned and Incomparable <HI>Sydenham,</HI> whose Works will never Die, and whose Ex∣ample all ought to follow, and not be forward to broach New Notions, and strain every thing to support an embrac'd Hypothesis, or to assert this or that to be the Original Cause of any Distemper, unless it could be made appear by undeniable Demonstration; but rather apply themselves diligently to the Ob∣servation of Diseases, thro' their Beginning, State and Declination, and be thereby per∣fectly acquainted with all their Symptoms, Variations, and Consequences, so as to be able safely and quickly to Cure them, which I
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>am sure all unprejudic'd Persons will agree, would be much better for the unhappy Patients afflicted with Distempers, than for their Phy∣sicians to be taken up with airy Speculations concerning them, and at the same time per∣haps, be at a Loss how to effect their Cure</P>
<P>AND, indeed, the many Mistakes there are made, and Errors committed in the Cure of Cutaneous Diseases, even by those from whom one would be far from expecting Mismanage∣ment, are very surprizing, and what I could not believe, if almost daily Experience did not con∣vince me of it, of which I could give very many Examples, but that I think it much better rather to draw a Veil over the Miscarriages of others, than expose them to Publick View.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of several Methods of curing the <HI>Itch,</HI> particular <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbi∣ness</HI> and <HI>Leprosy;</HI> the Reasons why so many miss of being Cured; the Danger of falling into grievous and incurable Distempers by ill Me∣thods, and pernicious Mercurial Applications; and of the safe, easy, and effectual Method of Cure ad∣vanced by the Author.</HEAD>
<P>MOST Authors agree, that the same Method and Medicines that will Cure an inveterate <HI>Itch,</HI> will likewise take Place in a <HI>Scabbiness, Leprosy,</HI> and most other Defilements of the Skin, if curable; and indeed Experience answers for the Truth of it, only with this difference, that the Method must be closely fol∣lowed for a longer Time, and the Medicines be made stronger for a <HI>Scabbiness</HI> and <HI>Leprosy,</HI> than it is requisite they should be for the first men∣tioned Infection.</P>
<P>BUT what that Method and those Medi∣cines are, that with the greatest Certainty, least Trouble, and without Danger, will ac∣complish the Cure of Cutaneous Diseases, is what Physicians differ very much about.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
<P>SOME recommend Bleeding and Purging as absolutely necessary; the first to cause Re∣vulsion, temperate the Blood, and allay its too great Ebullition, the last to cleanse the Stomach, Bowels, and all the Juices, from Impurities, and both of them to diminish the Humours of the Body in general, without all which, they are of Opinion the <HI>Itch</HI> and other Defaedations cannot safely or easily, if at all, be cured.</P>
<P>OTHERS advise to <HI>Sudorificks,</HI> or Sweat∣ing Medicines; and others to <HI>Diureticks,</HI> or such as work by Urine; some neglecting all eva∣cuating Medicines, prescribe sweetners of the Blood, and cooling <HI>Alteratives,</HI> which they be∣lieve will Cure by subduing the Cholerick Dis∣position and Acrid Quality of the Juices.</P>
<P>OTHERS, laying aside all Internal Reme∣dies, rely wholly upon External Applications for the Cure of Cuticular Maladies, such as Ointments, Baths and Washes, made of Tobac∣co, Brimstone, Elecampane, Sharp pointed Dock, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and others chiefly insist on Mer∣cury or Quicksilver, outwardly applied, either by a Girdle, or mix'd with Unguents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they say will effectually kill the <HI>Itch,</HI> and other Diseases of the Skin.</P>
<P>THUS Physical Authors vary exceedingly in their Opinions one from another, and each brings several Reasons and Arguments to sup port the Opinion he is of, or has advanced Those who plead most for External Applica¦tions, have but an indifferent Opinion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Purging, and inveigh mightily against Bleed∣ing,
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>which they say draws the foul Humour, that either never reached deeper than the Skin, or else that Nature had kindly expelled to the outer Parts, into the Blood and Juices, so as certainly to corrupt them, and fix the Distem∣per upon the whole Habit of the Body, and thereby render it incurable.</P>
<P><HI>MARTIANUS</HI> gives an Account of a certain Person, <Q><P>'Who labouring under the <HI>Itch,</HI> would have Four Pound of Blood taken from him by opening a Vein, upon which, that very Day, revulsion of the Putrid Humour being made from the Skin to the greater Veins by Venae-Section, he was taken with a Malignant Fever, which kill'd him the Fifth Day.'</P>
<P>'LETTING Blood <HI>(says another Author)</HI> must absolutely be avoided in this Cure, for thereby the Impurity is drawn into the Blood, and that defiled which before was pure.'</P></Q></P>
<P>THE famous <HI>Helmont</HI> mentions purging Medicines in this Distemper, as well as in other Cases, with Derision.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Willis,</HI> amongst many others, is of Opinion, that both Bleeding and Purging in Cutaneous Diseases are necessary.</P>
<P>SPEAKING of Bleeding he says, <Q><P>'The Effect is not taken away till first the Cause be removed, which may this way properly be done. Yea for an universal Disease, such as the <HI>Itch</HI> is, an universal Remedy, such as letting Blood is, seems convenient.'</P>
<P>HE likewise mightily recommends Purging in the following Words; 'Therefore Purges
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>ought both to begin and make an end of this Method of Cure; for tho' <HI>Helmont</HI> treats a Cathartick Medicine with high Dis∣dain, and, as it were, leads it in Triumph, because of it self it does not Cure the <HI>Itch;</HI> yet we may affirm, that this Disease is scarce ever easily, but never safely cured, without this sort of Physick.'</P>
<P>'HE that would Cure the <HI>Itch, (says Hart∣manus)</HI> must first of all Cleanse the Blood, for it lodges in the Saline, Vitriolick, and Alu∣minous Impurities thereof.'</P></Q></P>
<P><HI>ETMULLER</HI> also advises to Purging; and <HI>Sydenham,</HI> directing to sweating Medicines, and outward Applications for an Inveterate <HI>Itch,</HI> says, <Q>'But these Things ought not to be applied till the Patient's Body hath been first duly prepared by Bleeding and Purging.'</Q></P>
<P>BESIDES the Authorities of these Great and Learned Men for Bleeding and Purging in the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> there are many Examples given by Authors, of the unhappy Consequences o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attempting the Cure of External Diseases by outward Applications only.</P>
<P><HI>BORELLUS</HI> informs us of a Man, who being troubled with an exceeding Itching, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> endeavouring to Cure himself with a Wash in a few Hours after using it, <Q><P>'There wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blisters rais'd all over his Body, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little while after, he was so troubled wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Faintings and Swoonings, that he was ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nigh Death.'</P>
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
<P>'A lusty Matron <HI>(says Hildanus)</HI> about Forty Years Old, fat and of a moist Consti∣tution of Body, when in the Month of <HI>Fe∣bruary,</HI> she had put on a Quicksilver Girdle for a small <HI>Itch,</HI> and had worn it for three Weeks Night and Day, she indeed was rid of her <HI>Itch,</HI> but there followed a Saliva∣tion, exulceration of the Gums, and heavi∣ness in the Head, which was followed by a Catarrh on the Left Side, and weakness of the same.'</P></Q></P>
<P><HI>VELSCHIUS</HI> gives an Account of a Per∣son afflicted with this Disease, <Q>'Who neg∣lecting Universals, kill'd the <HI>Itch</HI> with Oint∣ments; presently upon which, Defluxions of Salt Humours supervening, and falling upon his Lungs, he spit Blood at times, and at length, an Hectick coming upon him, he died: When he was dead, his Lungs were found altogether corrupted, and most part of 'em harden'd into a Scirrhus.'</Q></P>
<P>BY these Accounts, amongst many others, that are left upon Record, to warn us against the like irrepairable Mischiefs, the Readers may judge what Care there ought to be taken, and what Skill there is required in curing Chronick Diseases of the Skin; and I believe it will be easily allow'd, that it is not only re∣quisite to Cure them surely, but safely too; for to omit Internal Remedies, and strike in those Distempers by external and repelling Ap∣plications, tho' ever so seemingly innocent in themselves, may be attended with very bad
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>Accidents, such as violent Fevers, Asthmas, Consumptions of the Lungs, Convulsions, Fall∣ing Sickness, Palsies, Apoplexies, Madness, internal Ulcers, Scirrhous Tumours, and other dangerous, and oftentimes incurable Maladies, under which, if the Patients escape with Life, they may remain miserable all their Days.</P>
<P>FOR when the malignant Humour is thus forc'd to retire from the external Parts of the Body, it is then circled about with the Blood, till it is deposited and fix'd upon such of the No∣ble internal Parts, as happen to be most weak, or apt to receive it. Thus if it falls on the Brain and Nerves, it produces the Apoplexy, Falling-Sickness, Palsy, Convulsions, or Madness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If it happens to fix on the Breast, it causes a vio∣lent Cough, dreadful Asthma, or Ulceration of the Lungs and incurable Consumption; if upon the Urinary Parts, it occasions the Diseases com∣mon to them, such as racking Pains, Dysury, Strangury, incurable Ulceration of the Kidneys, or Bladder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If upon the Liver and Spleen, Obstructions and Scirrhous Tumours of those Parts are produced; if it fixes on the Bowels, it causes a severe Cholick, Diarrhaea, Dysente∣ry, Inflammation of the Gutts, or Illiack Passion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if it does not happen to lodge on any of those particular Parts, it then commonly inflames the whole Mass of Blood universally, and so produces violent Fevers, continual or intermitting, threatning speedy Death.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
<P>AND the Illnesses that happen by such im∣prudent Management, sometimes do not appear till some Months after such outward Applica∣tions have been forborn.</P>
<P>WHAT a risque therefore do those run, who, being unhappily troubled with the <HI>Itch,</HI> or any other Cutaneous Distemper, endeavour to Cure themselves with Ointments, Washes, Quicksilver Girdles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which if they do not take effect, as very often happens, are then a very great Fatigue to them to no purpose, and if they do Cure, then expose them to the Danger of worse Diseases, and even Loss of Life.</P>
<P>THE Ingenious Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> in the Appendix to his Book, intituled, <HI>Medicina Gymnastica,</HI> informs us, that he split upon this Rock, and endured the most violent Illness imaginable for many Years together, by means of curing himself, with a Quicksilver Girdle, of an <HI>Itch</HI> that he had accidentally caught; an Abstract of which take as follows:</P>
<Q><P>'I wore it <HI>(says he, meaning a Mercurial Girdle)</HI> for several Months by times, and then laid it quite aside; but the Mischief was be∣gun, tho' I was not aware of it; for about a Month after, I awak'd one Morning with an unusual Giddiness, and in a little time after, I found several Convulsions begin to come upon me, in the Capillary Arteries of my Eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sometimes I should have my Hands drawn in, and my Fingers brought to the Palm of my Hand involuntarily. I
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>was not a little terrified, as any may imagine; but by proper means the severity of the Symptoms went off, and I remain'd only with a Giddiness, which was very trouble∣some. Once upon drinking the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters too long, that Vertiginous Rotation was so increased, that I was laid up for a Month with it, being scarce able to go about with∣out staggering like a drunken Man; but this extremity abated, and I remain'd heal∣thy under that Giddiness for several Years, till happening once to be more indisposed than usually, upon taking a Chalybeate, the Humour struck deeper into the Nerves of the Pectoral Muscles; so that I found my Shoulders begin to be contracted involuntari∣ly, and upon walking, a shortness of Breath, which I could discern, was caused by the preternatural pressure of those Muscles upon my Breast, which I have sometimes resisted so far, when it has happen'd to come upon me in the Streets, before I could get to a House I knew, that it has made my Eyes Flash, and brought other Epileptick Symp∣toms upon me, that I have been forced to take into a Shop, and desire leave to rest me for a time. These Things continued on me for a Year or more, and declining under these Spasms of my Breast, I was at length quite confined to my Home for near three Months, all the while growing worse and worse, in spite of the Power of any Medi∣cines I took, when it happend that I was
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>casually directed to the use of Riding, in order to which I removed to <HI>Hampstead,</HI> where I rode at least twice a Day, for the space of Seven Weeks. After I had by these means recovered a good Measure of Health, I enjoyed it about a Year and half, by the help of Riding at due Intervals; but think∣ing my self stronger than I really was, and Riding long Journies, I was took of a sud∣den with the strangest sort of <HI>Deliquium (or Fainting)</HI> that perhaps ever was heard of; to these sort of Fits was added a <HI>Diarrhaea (or Loosness)</HI> which was attended with a Nause∣ousness and Inclination to Vomit; and what is Remarkable, those Nights after my Vomiting, I should Sweat to that degree, as to make my Shirt and Sheets as wet as if they had been dip'd in Water, upon which I was refreshed and freed from the greater se∣verity of those Symptoms, which plainly shews how pernicious that Psoradick <HI>(or Itchy)</HI> Salt was, which the Mercurial Particles had repelled and intimately mix'd in my Blood.'</P>
<P>'THUS I had three Calamities upon me at once, a Flux, a Vomiting, and the <HI>Deli∣quiums (or Faintings)</HI> I spoke of before, the last of which had something so incredible to 'em, that I shall forbear to relate it; I do not speak in heat, but seriously and calmly, that the Vomiting, tho' very frequent and severe, was desirable, if compared with these most strange Faintings, which were so tor∣menting
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>and insupportable, that if I had been Stab'd or had had my Flesh cut with Knives, I am certain I could much easier have born it; I betook my self to moderate Riding again, and held out even under such pressing Severities, as I have related, no less a time than a Year and Nine Months, when at length these Evils gained upon me, and my Vomit∣ings were so frequent and incredibly violent, that they took away the use of my Limbs, so that I was forced to be lifted every time up∣on my Horse, that I might continue my Ri∣ding, tho' it were but to gain a little perio∣dical Ease, till that seisure on my Limbs in∣creasing, I was confined to my Chamber, my Legs and Thighs swell'd, and I was very near the End of this tedious Journey of Life.'</P></Q>
<P>THE Account this Learned and Ingenious Physician gives of his own dreadful Illness, occasioned by his wearing a Quicksilver Girdle, together with the Instances before given, of the Mischiefs that have been done by that Method, as also by Washes and Ointments, are suf∣ficient, one would think, to deter all Persons from tampering with outward Medicines, for the Cure of Cutaneous Diseases, without taking proper Internal Remedies also, by the Directi∣on of a Skilful Physician.</P>
<P>AND here it will not be amiss to exemplify the great danger of Quicksilver Girdles, by another Case that lately happen'd.</P>
<P>ON the 24th of <HI>May,</HI> an Ingenious Wo∣man of very good Repute, in the utmost Fright
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>and Consternation (for which, indeed, she had a great deal of Reason) desired my Assistance; She gave me to understand, that she had for some time before been troubled with the <HI>Itch,</HI> and for the Cure of it, had put on a Quick∣silver Girdle, which, in a short time, raised such a violent Salivation, as I scarcely ever saw before; for besides the ordinary Symp∣toms of soreness of the Mouth, exulceration of the Gums, stinking Breath, loosness of the Teeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it was attended with others very severe and dangerous; particularly such a prodigious Inflammation and swelling of the Glandules about her Throat, that at first, I questioned very much whether I should be able to save her Life; and I really believe if she had not apply'd for Relief at the Instant she did, she would in a little time have been suf∣focated or choak'd, and so have perish'd by the effect of that pernicious Girdle.</P>
<P>I immediately endeavour'd to check the Salivation, and remove the Symptoms by <HI>Ca∣tharticks,</HI> Specifick <HI>Absorbents, Cardiacks, Gar∣garisms,</HI> and other proper Remedies, which, by God's Blessing, had all the wish'd for Suc∣cess, sav'd her from the Grave, and restor'd her to perfect Health.</P>
<P>THE narrow escape this Woman had, and what has been said before on this Head, will, I hope, prevent all Persons who happen to read these Papers, from making use of Mercurial or Quicksilver Girdles, on any account what∣ever.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
<P>NEITHER is frequent Bleeding, or in a large quantity at a time, to be attempted without Danger; for it is certain, that irregu∣lar Bleeding many times draws the pernicious Humour of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> from the Scarf-Skin, which alone was infected, into the Mass of Blood, and to the Internal and more Noble Parts, that before were not in the least tainted with it.</P>
<P>SO likewise Purging imprudently with strong Medicines, will have the same effect, and not often clear the External Parts of their troublesome defilement neither; many times it happens that Patients may Purge themselves into the Grave, with the common violent <HI>Ca∣tharticks,</HI> before their Skin will be freed from the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> and this <HI>Helmont</HI> well knew, and made a handle of it to despise Purging, in the manner before mentioned.</P>
<P>IF therefore Learned Physicians themselves, who make the Body of Man, and all the De∣fects and Distempers it is liable to, their con∣tinual Study; and who are well acquainted with the Virtue, Nature and Use of Medicines, which are keen Instruments in their Hands and which, when well apply'd, restore the Di∣seased Body to pristine Health, but when im∣properly prescribed, quite the contrary; if I say, such Eminent Men make false steps, as in the Instances just now given, and diffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from one another about the most effectual Me∣thod of curing the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> as already shewn How should the Afflicted Patients, who mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>be supposed to be wholly Ignorant of the Na∣ture, Cause, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Distemper, and who know not the Virt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Medicines, or at least, when, and when not, there is a pro∣per Indication for their Use, be able to form a right Judgment, or take and use the most seemingly innocent Remedies, without ex∣tream Danger?</P>
<P>HAVING thus given the Opinion of Phy∣sicians, concerning Bleeding, Purging, and Ex∣ternal Applications in the Cure of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> and apprised the Reader of the Danger that attends the unskilful use of them, it may not be amiss to offer my own Opinion concerning their true Use, and then describe the Method that to me appears most Rational for the Cure of Cutaneous Distempers, and which Experi∣ence has confirmed to be the Safest, Surest, and most Expeditious to eradicate the <HI>Itch,</HI> Invete∣rate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbiness</HI> and <HI>Leprosy</HI> when Curable.</P>
<P>FIRST then, as to Bleeding, it ought not promiscuously to be advised to all Persons, nei∣ther is it absolutely to be forborn; large or frequent Bleeding weakens the Patient, and, as already said, draws the Infection inwards, and often fixes it upon the habit of the Body, so as to render it very difficult to Cure; but to omit Bleeding entirely, where a Patient is Young, and of a Plethorick Constitution, and whose Juices are apt to be much disturbed, and whole Body disordered upon administring Remedies, is certainly very erroneous; and that omission
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>may be attended with an acute Fever, or other Accidents, end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ering Life.</P>
<P>EXTREAMS the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fore must be avoided, and if a Fever is to be feared, Bleeding in a small quantity, may without Danger of at∣tracting the foul Humour inwards, be premised, in order to prevent all Accidents, but in my Opinion, for no other reason.</P>
<P>GENTLE Purging is always requisite for all Persons, whose Circumstances of Body will admit of it, some very few excepted; but the strong common Purges must be avoided, not only as too fatiguing to the Patient, but per∣nicious also; for all <HI>Catharticks</HI> made use of in these Cases, ought to be very gentle, that so Nature may not be oppressed, but on the con∣trary assisted, and the offending Matter be car∣ried off by a constant and easy Evacuation, by which the Patient will escape the Danger of drawing the Diseasy Humour to the Internal Parts, and of fixing it in the Blood and Juices, which violent Purges would expose him to.</P>
<P>PROPER External Applications are also exceeding necessary to expedite the Cure, and to eradicate more certainly the foul Infection, and are very safe to be used, when gentle <HI>Ca∣tharticks</HI> (with which <HI>Specificks</HI> must ever be∣mixed) are also inwardly given; but are very dangerous when used unskilfully, alone, or without the necessary Precautions.</P>
<P>IN the choice of External Applications <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there is much Judgment required; for such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are proper for one Person troubled with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="38" REF="45"/><HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> may not be so for another; yet in ge∣neral they ought to be of a very subtile and pe∣netrating Nature, that they may easily enter the External Pores of the Skin, and be also en∣dued with a Specifick Quality, to mortify or kill the pernicious sharp Humour lodged there∣in, and likewise be adapted to enlarge the excretory Ducts, that there may be free per∣spiration for the future, and that the excre∣mentitious Salts combined with Sulphur, may no more be pent in, and by Stagnation acquire Acrimony, and so cause Itching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SPECIFICK <HI>Alteratives, Diureticks</HI> and <HI>Sudorificks,</HI> are also often very useful to mend the Crasis of the Blood, depurate the Juices, rectify the Glands, open the External Pores, and restore their Tone, and must be prescri∣bed as the Case may require.</P>
<P>I might here give various Prescriptions, of Remedies of every kind I have mentioned, from the Works of Learned and Eminent Phy∣sicians, for the Cure of the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbiness</HI> and <HI>Leprosy;</HI> but considering that the Judgment of a Skilful Man is always requisite for their right Appli∣cation, even in the most trifling <HI>Itch,</HI> and that tho' those Prescriptions might be excellent in their kind, and should fully answer the Cha∣racter Authors have given of them; yet if Pa∣tients should proceed on their own Heads, and unskilfully take or use them, they might prove very prejudicial, and instead of Curing their Diseases, injure their Bodies, and perhaps en∣danger
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>their Lives, I thought it best to omit them.</P>
<P>BUT the Method that I think most proper to Cure the <HI>Itch,</HI> and other Chronick Diseases of the Skin, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> In the first place, if the Patient is Young, of a Sanguine Complexion, Plethorick, or inclined to a Fever, the Day before I order any Medicines, I direct to Bleed∣ing in a small quantity, in order to prevent a Fever, or other acute Illness, and for no other end; but if no such Accident is to be feared, I omit Bleeding, and immediately advise to both Internal and External Remedies, to be taken and used together.</P>
<P>THE External Medicines I direct to, cer∣tainly clear the Skin from all manner of foulness, rendering it in a short time smooth, fair, and entirely free from Itching, and from all Pim∣ples, Scurf, Scabs, and other Defilements; whilst the Internal ones, which are gently <HI>Purging, Diuretick,</HI> and <HI>Alterative,</HI> cleanse the Blood and Juices from Impurities, destroy and carry off sharp Humours, and Acrid Particles, that may have intimately mixed with the Blood, and infected its whole Mass; break the Combinations of Saline and Sulphureous Cor∣puscles, rectify the Glandules, free the Pores from obstructing Viscosities, and effectually clear the whole Habit from all Filth and Putrefaction whatsoever; and yet are so ho∣mogeneous to Nature, as not to cause any Sickness at Stomach, disorder of Body, or re∣quire Confinement, more than barely to guard
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>against Wet Weather, or more than ordinary Cold.</P>
<P>NEITHER are the External Remedies I advise to, compounded with Brimstone, or ac∣companied with any nauseous Smell, but may be used by the most delicate Person, without Offence, and yet are more effectual for the Intention than those with which Brimstone is mix'd: Now by this Method, and the Me∣dicines I Order (which I always prepare my selt, and which both External and Internal are different from the common Remedies) the Diseasy Matter, in whatsoever Corner it lurks, will be ferreted out and entirely destroyed, with safety to the Patients, who will thereby be happily restored to their Pristine Health.</P>
<P>IT may here be enquired of me, why, since the External Medicines I speak of, will effectu∣ally clear the Skin from all Defilements, I do not rely on them for the Cure of a recent <HI>Itch,</HI> that has only infected the Scarf-Skin and not penetrated deeper, without advising to Inter∣nal Remedies? To which I answer, That no Man can be assured, that some of the subtile Itchy Particles have not penetrated the small Blood Vessels, and if it should happen that they have, tho' the <HI>Itch,</HI> to all appearance might be cured, yet those small Particles, that by getting into the Blood have escaped being de∣stroyed by the outward Remedies, will, by circulating about with it, soon infect all the Fluids, and so the <HI>Itch</HI> will break out again in a few Months after, and prove worse and
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>more stubborn than before, as Persons without Number who have endeavoured to be cured that way, have experienced to their Cost, and which, by taking proper Internals at the same time, might have been effectually prevented; besides, by administring peculiar. Purging and Alterative Medicines, all Accidents and Distem∣pers, that the using of even the Safest outward Applications make the Patients liable to, as be∣fore shewn, are absolutely guarded against.</P>
<P>IT may likewise be asked, why, If the In∣ternal Remedies I direct to, are of such Effica∣cy as I mention, I do not wholly depend upon them for the Cure of Diseases of the Skin, without advising to External Applications? To which it may be answered, That we ought to attack such stubborn Distempers with all our force, and by all likely ways of succeeding; besides which, we cannot reasonably suppose it possible for a Patient to be cured near so soon by Internal Medicines alone, as by them and External Applications together; the whole Mass of Blood and Juices will take up a consi∣derable time to be perfectly altered and purifi∣ed, and much longer will it be, before the Dis∣easy Particles lodged in the External Pores of the Skin, can by Internals alone, be absolutely overcome and destroyed; but when with them we joyn proper outward Remedies, which are always safe whilst gentle <HI>Catharticks, &amp;c.</HI> are given inwardly, we then answer all the Intentions of Cure, and strike home to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Morbifick Matter, so as to destroy it Root an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>Branch, and from thence may reasonably pro∣mise our selves happy Success in a very short time.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said, may be ga∣thered the Reasons why so many Persons miss of being perfectly cured of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> for many Months, and oftentimes Years; for by using outward Applications alone, tho' proper ones, the Cure even of a new caught <HI>Itch,</HI> is not often perfectly accomplished, and when it is, not without Danger; neither can Persons hand∣somely, I'm sure not expeditiously, be Cured by taking Internal Medicines, tho' exceeding good, unless assisted with proper Externals at the same time; and to take and use Internal and External Remedies together, that are not very Efficacious (a misfortune often happening to Persons who follow the Vulgar Methods) is only trifling with the Distemper and pro∣longing their Affliction; for if they happen to be better, and seem quite Cured, it is general∣ly but for a short time, and the Disease soon after breaks out again, with greater force than before.</P>
<P>MANY Persons have been thus fatigued with a simple <HI>Itch,</HI> sometimes for Years toge∣ther, and at last ended their Days, by means of a severe <HI>Scabbiness</HI> or <HI>Leprosy,</HI> when if at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst they had been treated in a regular Me∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hod, with the most effectual Medicines, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight have been compleatly Cured, perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a few Days.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
<P>TO these Reasons, why Persons miss of be∣ing entirely cured, we may add, that those afflicted with the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> are for the most part ashamed to own it, and also imagining, being otherwise well in Health, that the Di∣sease is but of slight Consequence, and not at all Dangerous, they neglect to apply to a Skil∣ful Physician for their Cure, but follow the Advice of some good Woman or other, few of whom are without a Receipt of some Oint∣ment, or other Medicine, which they really think will certainly Cure the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> or else they take or use Brimstone, the vulgar Remedy, which, besides its Nauseousness, often proves of dangerous Consequence, especially to those Hectically inclined; and so the Patients are very much fatigued, and many times ruined instead of being Cured.</P>
<P>NAY, that they are sometimes kill'd out∣right, by following the Advice of Women, and other unskilful Persons, is demonstrated by a deplorable Accident that happen'd but a few Years ago; for on the 15th of <HI>December,</HI> 1717. four young Men, Apprentices to Mr. <HI>Sluce,</HI> a Weaver in <HI>Old George-street Spittle-Fields,</HI> being pester'd with the <HI>Itch,</HI> took each of them a Dose of some pernicious Drug, that a Woman (Sister to one of the young Men) gave them, with an Assurance that it would certainly Cure the <HI>Itch;</HI> and which it too surely and unhappily did, by depriving every one of them of Life that very Day, to the great surprize and Sor∣row of their Friends, and unspeakable Grief and
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>distracting Terror of Mind of the unfortunate Woman who gave it them, and who, it seems, was very far from designing 'em any Injury.</P>
<P>SOME People I have met with, who think to lightly of the <HI>Itch</HI> as to judge it a thing of nothing, a slight matter, scarcely worth mind∣ing, and are so very weak as to expect to be cured of it for a Trifle, and seem frightned when they are told of being put into a regular Me∣thod of Cure, that will come to more than Ten or Twenty Shillings Expence.</P>
<P>TO hear such Persons talk would almost provoke one to Laughter, were it not for the dismal Effects that usually attend their Igno∣rance; for I have observed, that for the most part it is this Class of People who are seldom cured of the <HI>Itch,</HI> but suffer it in length of Time, to terminate in a foul <HI>Scabbiness</HI> or loath∣some <HI>Leprosy;</HI> or if they are cured of the <HI>Itch</HI> by Brimstone, Quicksilver-Girdles, Ointments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to one or other of which they commonly have Recourse, they are often precipitated into other dreadful Diseases; in either of which Cases, they would then give above half they are worth in the World, to be restor'd to Health.</P>
<P>IT would be well therefore, if those trou∣bled with the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> would seriously reflect upon the dangerous Consequences I have men∣tion'd, and consider, That it is not This or That Medicine (tho' ever so good) that ought to be relied on; but that it is requisite to know when, and when not, it is proper. That the Habit of the Body, State of the Disease, and
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>other Circumstances of the Patient, should be carefully considered: That the best Medicines often prove hurtful, when prescribed unskilfully, or at Random; and that therefore for Patients to proceed on their own Heads, or to follow the Advice of Women, or other unskilful Persons, is exceeding dangerous, may be attended with Dis∣mal Consequences, and perhaps cost them their Lives, as the Examples before given, fully prove.</P>
<P>AMONG the many Instances I could give of the taking and using Brimstone ineffectually, I shall only trouble my Readers with the follow∣ing, which are very remarkable.</P>
<P>A Country Gentleman happening in a Fa∣mily who were all troubled with the <HI>Itch,</HI> was quickly infected with that Distemper, which, as soon as he precieved, he endeavoured to Cure by taking Brimstone and Milk inwardly, and using Brimstone in an Ointment outwardly, in a very plentiful Manner, according to the vulgar Method, and for a longer Time than is customary, but to no purpose; for he de∣clared to me, that his <HI>Itch</HI> continued upon him as vexatious and bad as ever.</P>
<P>HE then had the Opinion of several Physi∣cians, one after another, and by their Advice took and used abundance of Medicines, which, together with their Fees, cost him a large Sum of Money; at last the Distemper seem'd to be conquer'd, and he thought himself perfectly cured, and in a short space of Time married; soon after which, the <HI>Itch</HI> broke out again upon him to as great a degree as ever; nei∣ther
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>did the New married Lady escape, but was as much pester'd with that Distemper as himself.</P>
<P>AT that time he happened to meet with the first Edition of this little Book, and after read∣ing it, thought proper to put himself and Spouse under my Care for Cure; and in a short time, by punctually following my Directions, they were both entirely freed from that tor∣menting Disease, for which the Gentleman (who could neither be cured by Brimstone, nor any of the Medicines he had before taken and used) with abundance of Thanks, not only paid me to my Content, but also made me a handsome Present, expressing at the same time the greatest Joy and Satisfaction, for having been so fortunate as to meet with my little Treatise, which he said he would not but have seen for ever so much, the reading of it having caused him to apply to me, and be (as he was pleased to say himself) so safely and easily Cured; for he assured me that what he had taken and used before, by his Physician's Pre∣scriptions, (as well as the Brimstone) was not only ineffectual, but very nauseous, and withal exceeding costly.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Gentleman who lived not far from <HI>Epsom,</HI> apply'd to me very lately for the Cure of the <HI>Itch,</HI> with which not only himself but his Son was very much afflicted; his Son, as the Gentleman inform'd me, had in vain gone through a very long and nauseous Brimstone Course, had taken <HI>Epsom</HI> Waters,
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>used a Liquor which is publickly sold, and which the Author pretends will Cure the <HI>Itch</HI> without any other help, and had taken and used many other things, but all to no pur∣pose; for which reason the Gentleman, finding the ill Success his Son had, would try none of them himself, but came to me for Advice and Medicines, and as soon as he was cured, sent his Son to me also, whom I put into a regular Course, and quickly discharged perfectly well, to the entire Satisfaction of them both.</P>
<P>BRIMSTONE also, in the Cure of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> is attended with this further Incon∣venience, that it obliges those who take and use it, either to confine themselves during the whole Course, or else to let every one they come near, know they are troubled with the <HI>Itch;</HI> for the smell of it is so very strong, as not to be overcome, or be concealed, from even those who only just pass by the Persons who use it, much less from them they converse with, to whom it smells much more plain, strong and filthy than to themselves: And it is as natural for People to believe that those who use Brimstone, use it for the <HI>Itch,</HI> as it is for them to believe, that those that smell of it, use it.</P>
<P>AS to such as are ashamed to own they are troubled with the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> and for that Rea∣son neglect to apply to a Physician, or a Skil∣ful Person, for Cure, they are certainly much in the wrong; for they may be assured, that it is the Principle, as well as Interest of all
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>Physicians or Persons practising Physick, to keep private any Illness their Patients are de∣sirous to conceal, and to direct to such Reme∣dies as may be taken and used privately, with∣out the knowledge of any other Person, and without Confinement; as the Medicines I ad∣vise to in such Cases most certainly may, and so as not to be discover'd, even by the nearest Friend, tho' lying in the same Bed.</P>
<P>I must not omit another Reason, why Per∣sons are often pestered with the <HI>Itch,</HI> every Three or Four Months, Spring and Fall, <HI>&amp;c. viz.</HI> That when by a proper Method they find themselves tolerably well, and free from Itching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they grow weary of the trouble of taking and using Medicines, and leave them off before the Diseasy Particles are wholly Eradicated, and thereby deceive themselves; for if the least part of the Itchy Infection hap∣pens to remain in their Clothes, Gloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as sometimes may happen even after Washing, they then catch the Distemper afresh, which would be prevented by continuing the use of Remedies according to the Direction of a Skil∣ful Man, for a reasonable Time, that so all the very Seeds of the Disease, either in their Bo∣dies or Clothes, may be utterly destroyed.</P>
<P>AND for the better preventing all Danger of this kind, it is necessary for the Patients, as soon as the Itching and appearance of the Distemper are taken off, to change their Clothes, Sheets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> immediately, and be very careful not to wear them again, till they are sure,
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>by often boiling, washing, and cleansing, all the Itchy Particles that lodged in them, are entirely mortify'd and expung'd.</P>
<P>FOR want of due Care in this particular on∣ly, abundance of Persons have been exceeding∣ly fatigued with this hateful Disease, on and off, for many Months, and sometimes Years together; of which I could give several Ex∣amples that have happen'd within my own Knowledge, but shall mention but one.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of Consideration came to me sometime since, troubled with a severe and universal <HI>Itch;</HI> upon enquiring how he had re∣ceived the Infection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He told me he had been troubled with that Distemper some Months before, but had been perfectly cured of it, and assured me that he caught it again to that degree I saw, only by his Servant giv∣ing him, by Mistake, a pair of Gloves to wear, that he remember'd afterwards to have worn, but once or twice at the most, during the time he was pester'd with the <HI>Itch.</HI> He added, that he kept them on his Hands scarce∣ly an Hour, before he perceived the Mistake, threw them away, and presently wash'd and scour'd his Hands two or three times, but all to no purpose; for the <HI>Itch</HI> soon discovered it self between his Fingers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from thence spread all over his Body.</P>
<P>BY this Relation all Persons may perceive how very subtle, penetrating, and infecting the Itchy Particles are, that could lie so long in a pair of Gloves, and afterwards so soon
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>and so far insinuate themselves into the Skin, as not to be wash'd or scour'd off, but to cause a very severe, universal and stubborn <HI>Itch.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Gentleman I put into a regular Me∣thod of Cure, which soon had the desired Effect, for which he handsomely gratify'd me, and is at this Time perfectly well.</P>
<P>NOW by the Method I have advanced, the Directions I give, and the Medicines I have mentioned to use, (which, as before said, I always prepare my self, and which are not difficult to take, or to be apply'd, or in the least fatiguing to the Patients) those miserably afflicted with the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Hu∣mours, Scabbiness</HI> or <HI>Leprosy</HI> that are Curable, and even many that have been pronounced in∣curable, may be certainly restored to Health in a reasonable time, proportionably to the Stub∣borness and Inveteracy of those Diseases.</P>
<P>SO also Persons troubled with the <HI>King's-Evil,</HI> stubborn <HI>Scrophulous Breakings out, Tu∣mours, Running Ulcers,</HI> &amp;c. may, by the Me∣thod I have proposed, be more assuredly and sooner Cured, with the Blessing of God, than by any other whatever.</P>
<P>A few Remedies well adapted and rightly administer'd, for a reasonable time in all those Cases, will generally take effect, without fa∣tiguing the Patients with a vast number of Me∣dicines to nauseate their Stomachs, and tire their Patience.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
<P>BUT what hinders many People afflicted with the <HI>King's-Evil</HI> and <HI>Leprosy</HI> from being Cured, is their want of sufficient Resolution to go through a regular Course; for tho' they are put into one that is neither nauseous troublesome, nor requiring Confinement; and tho' they seem at first resolved to go thro' it and are convinced, that unless they do conti∣nue it for a reasonable time, they cannot be Cured; yet, which is strange, they often stag∣ger in their Resolution, grow weary they know not why, and many times leave off before they themselves can so much as expect Relief▪ whereas if they would have stedfastly adhered to the Resolution they first took, they might in all human Probability, have been certainly Cured of their Distemper, and been restor'd to perfect Health.</P>
<P>THERE are also many Persons, labouring under the last mentioned stubborn Chronick Diseases, who, dreading the uncertain Expence of a regular Course of Medicines, are desirous to enter into a Contract, to be Cured for a cer∣tain Sum of Money. These sort of People, in my Opinion, are the fittest in the World to fall into the Hands of some of our bold, daring Practitioners, who venture at all, and never fail to promise Wonders; for Patients of this kind, are apt to be pleased and taken with the positive Assurances these Men give them, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perfectly and infallibly Curing them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereas a modest, faithful Physician neither will, nor ought to undertake Patients in that
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>manner, but only desire a reasonable Price for his Medicines, and suitable Fees in Considera∣tion of his Trouble, Advice, or Attendance; nei∣ther will he give his Patients such positive As∣surances of an infallible Cure, but be cautious in what he says, and only promise in these and all other difficult Cases, to endeavour to the utmost of his Power to Cure them; and for that End, put them into such a rational Course of Medicine, as he really believes, and has found, to be most effectual for such stubborn Maladies, and from which Course they, as well as he, may reasonably, and in all likelihood, expect the desired Success.</P>
<P>THIS is the only Method I take; and the Success God has been pleased to bless me with, in the Cure of the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbiness</HI> and <HI>Leprosy,</HI> &amp;c. is very remarkable, and I believe can hardly be parallel'd; having, since I first published this little Treatise, discharg∣ed from under my Care great Numbers of Per∣sons, who apply'd to me for Cure of inveterate Diseases of the Skin, perfectly well, and who are, many of them, Men of the first Rank, and of Eminent Learning and Parts, and had gone through many Courses of Physick to no purpose, before they came to me; particularly one Gentle∣man, a Divine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that had been unfortunately afflicted with a very foul <HI>Scabbiness</HI> for some Years, and had ineffectually tried almost all Methods, whom I perfectly Cured in a very short time, (considering the invete∣racy of the Disease) to his entire Satisfaction.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
<P>ANOTHER Person, who had been af∣flicted with a <HI>Leprous Humour</HI> about his Thighs and Privy Parts for many Years together, and had gone through several Courses of Physick in vain, and afterwards tried abundance of particular Remedies to no Purpose, apply'd himself to me, tho' at the same time seem'd to despair of being ever perfectly Cured, but hoped only to be reliev'd in some Measure, his <HI>Leprous Humour</HI> having grown, for some time before, more than ordinarily troublesome to him, and when he came to me, was so very Vex∣atious as to hinder Sleep at Night; this Man I put into the Method of Cure I thought most proper, which had such Success, that in a reasonable Time, contrary to his own Ex∣pectation, he was not only made perfectly easy, but was also compleatly Cured, at which he mightily rejoiced; about four Months after I had been paid for his Cure, and had dis∣miss'd him, he came voluntarily and acknow∣ledg'd the Service I had done him, in a very handsome manner.</P>
<P>A little while ago a young Man about Se∣venteen Years of Age, who was in a very bad Condition indeed, put himself under my Care for Cure; when he came to me, he was all over from Head to Foot so full of red, angry, sore Pimples, (which by turns also itched in∣tolerably) that one could scarcely stick a Pin between them; and his Arms and Legs were so sore and stiff with them, that he had much ado to walk from the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> to my
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>House; he told me his Mother had been so before him, and supposed he had it from her Hereditarily; the Apothecary, who is made use of by the Family he lives with, had done all he could for him, without his receiving the least Benefit; this young Man I put into a regular easy Course, which, thro' God's Mer∣cy, had the desired Effect, and he was perfectly Cured in such a short time, that himself and Friends admired at it; some time after he had paid me, and I had discharg'd him, he came unexpectedly and full of Joy, to return me Thanks for my Care of him, and at the same time shewed his Gratitude, by making me a small Present.</P>
<P>I could give many more Examples of ex∣traordinary Cases that I have met with, and have had Success in, but think those I have already given, sufficient.</P>
<P>I cannot here conclude, without taking No∣tice, of the Absurdity of some Practitioners, who confine themseves to one Sett of Medicines, which they give to all Persons troubled with the Distempers I have treated about, and which they think will answer the End, in People of all Habits, Ages and Constitutions; which undoubtedly is altogether against Reason, and needs no further Confutation.</P>
<P>I find my self often obliged to vary my Me∣dicines, according to the State of the Disease, Habit of the Body, and other Circumstances of the Patient, tho' generally speaking, the Method I take (except in some extraordinary
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>Cases, in which a <HI>Cardiack</HI> and <HI>Sudorifick</HI> Course, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be required, and where Di∣seases of the Skin are complicated with other Illnesses) is one and the same, tho' the Medi∣cines may be different.</P>
<P>AND even for a Consideration of less mo∣ment than that of Health, <HI>viz.</HI> for conveni∣ency of the Patient, it is sometimes necessary to change the External Remedies; as for Ex∣ample, Instead of ordering Ointments outward∣ly, I have been obliged for the sake of nice Persons, who were utterly against using any thing daubing, or that would appear upon their Linnen, to prepare a Liquor as clear as fair Water, and of a pleasant Scent, to be used externally for the same purpose, and which will certainly have the same good Effect; it being a delicate Medicine, very Efficacious, and not to be seen after using, either upon the Skin, or Linnen, only being a difficult Preparation, is somewhat more expensive to the Patient than many other Applications.</P>
<P>FROM this short Account of Cutaneous Diseases, I hope my Readers, at least the un∣prejudiced part of them, will be convinced, that the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> may be easily and safely Cured, without the use of Brimstone, Confine∣ment of the Patient, or knowledge of other Persons; for that there are other Remedies much pleasanter, and more effectual than Brim∣stone (which besides its nauseousness, often∣times will not Cure; but on the contrary, when taken and used by Hectical Persons, proves
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>very injurious) is most certain, since Expe∣rience vouches for it; and that Patients may be Cured of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> without more than ordinary Confinement, is as true, since the Evacuating Remedies I have found necessary, and make use of, are so very gentle, that those who take them may go Abroad about their Bu∣siness, without any Disorder, or further Obser∣vation, than only not to expose themselves to wet Weather, or to extraordinary Cold; and also that Patients may be Cured without the knowledge of other Persons, is very plain, be∣cause the External Medicines I advise to, may be used privately, and as they have not any ill Scent, they can by no means be discovered.</P>
