<HEAD>THIS ACCOUNT OF <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters Is Dedicated To the most Excellent S<SUP>r.</SUP> <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> President of the ROYAL SOCIETY; And to the Excellent D<SUP>r.</SUP> <HI>John Bateman,</HI> President of the <HI>College of Physicians;</HI> By FREDERICK SLARE, M. D. Fellow of the <HI>College of Physicians,</HI> and of the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>O great and so just is the Fame and Wis∣dom of Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton,</HI> that his Appro∣bation of any Sub∣ject in Physick or Philosophy
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>suffices to recommend it to the World, without the Necessity of superadding Arguments, Reasons, or Experiments, to give it more Credit or Authority: But we have also the concurring Testi∣mony of another Person, emi∣nent for solid Erudition, Presi∣dent of the <HI>Facultas Medica,</HI> or College of Physicians. It was in <HI>your Presence,</HI> Sirs, and not <HI>in yours alone,</HI> but together with several Fellows of both these illustrious Societies, before whom the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters were brought, and have been examin'd by several Experi∣ments, and were tasted, and by <HI>You</HI> were highly commended for their Strength and grateful Taste, and promising Vertue, and grant∣ed, That they did much exceed the <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, with which they were compar'd.</P>
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
<P>Upon this Approbation of <HI>Yours,</HI> together with my own Experience of the good these Waters had done to my self, and also to several of my Friends of late and formerly, I thought I had Reason enough to undertake this Province, of pub∣lishing this Account of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters.</P>
<P>The Design of this Tract is not to depreciate or undervalue the <HI>Spa</HI> Waters; for they have doubt∣less been of considerable Benefit to Mankind, and will, I hope, continue to do much good; but yet since a kind Providence opens a richer or more salubrious Trea∣sure of Waters, shall we not thankfully embrace this Gift of God? The <HI>Spa</HI> Waters have had a great Advantage above these,
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>they have been longer and more apply'd to than other Waters of that Kind. Much perhaps may be due to the happy Scituation, and good Accommodation of the Place, which invited and caus'd a more copious and numerous Resort of rich and populous Neighbouring Nations, such as <HI>Flanders, Germany, France,</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> The <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters lie more North, have been most frequented by the <HI>Northern</HI> Inhabitants of <HI>Germany;</HI> and of late Years Persons of the highest Birth and Quality, even Princes of the Illustrious Houses of <HI>Hanover</HI> and of <HI>Saxony,</HI> have graced these Waters with their Presence, and have discern'd their Vertue and good Effects, and have given them a greater Fame than formerly: But <HI>England,</HI> which has been so un∣fortunate as to have known no∣thing
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>of them hitherto, is now like to be supply'd by wise Me∣thods taken to furnish this Coun∣try with considerable Quantity, of these Waters, at whose Arrival (which is daily expected) their own Vertue will suffice to give them Reputation.</P>
<P>But that I may crown, and give the finishing Stroke to this Recom∣mendation of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, we have the Experience and Exam∣ple of our Gracious Sovereign, a Wise and Judicious Prince, who has chosen and preferr'd these, be∣fore any of that vast Variety of Steel Waters which <HI>Germany</HI> abounds with. You have a lively Evi∣dence and Attestation of the Health-preserving Vertue of these Waters, visible in his Majesty's healthful Countenance, who not only the
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>last Year, but in many preceding Years, drank these cordial and a∣nimating Waters. Nor will it dis∣please a Prince endow'd with so much Bounty and Benevolence, to have been a happy Occasion of recommending this salutiferous Fountain, or Source of Water, to his <HI>English</HI> Subjects. It was a Pre∣sent made by one of his Majesty's Family, which enabled me to make the several Tryals and Experi∣ments mention'd in this little Trea∣tise. But amongst the rest, that which gave me the greatest Satis∣faction and Comfort was this, That they could be brought in so great a Perfection, as to contain and carry their Virtue entirely good to us, perhaps, with less Diminu∣tion than a Bottle of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> or old <HI>Rhenish</HI> do bring theirs. And may our most Clement and Mer∣ciful
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>King, the Glorious Instrument of so much Good and Happiness to us, Himself enjoy a Succession of many Years in perfect Health, Peace, and Prosperity, is the con∣stant and fervent Prayer of,</P>

<HEAD><HI>AN ACCOUNT OF THE</HI> Nature and Excellent Proper∣ties and Virtues of the <HI>Pyr∣mont</HI> Waters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING procured a Quan∣tity of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, I made some Trials with them, both internal and external, by Drinking them, and by other Ex∣periments which are here related. By the Tast I manifestly discovered that they contain'd a rich Chalybeat In∣gredient, far exceeding that of the best
<PB N="2" REF="16"/><HI>Spa</HI> Water I ever tasted: The <HI>Spa</HI> Waters have justly the Preference, not only to our <HI>English</HI> Steel Waters, but to all the Foreign Waters that are brought over, which made me compare these with the <HI>Spa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spa</HI> Waters are then looked upon to be most excellent, when they sparkle in the Glass, and give a brisk Tast to the Palate. The <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters gave this Proof of their Briskness, as soon as the Cork was opened, and the Air was admitted, did make a notable Ebullition, like bot∣tled Cyder, and gave a smart, spirituous, and pleasant Tast, and continued the brisk and high chalybeat Relish to the last Glass, tho' we were some Hours about the drinking off a Bottle of Two Quarts.</P>
<P>In Reference to the internal Use of these Waters, I prosecuted the fol∣lowing Method: I got some excellent good <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, I drank them for 6 or 7 Days, a Flask at a Time; I then drank the same Quantity of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water for 4 Days, and afterwards continued the Use of both these Waters alternately, until I had drank about 20 Days: The Result of this Experi∣ment
<PB N="3" REF="17"/>was so plain and manifest to me, that the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters gave me more Spirit and Strength those Days I drank them, than when I us'd the others; and I have good Reason to hope, that many Persons will confirm this Experience of mine, when they shall be so happy as to obtain these Waters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water is by the Fo∣reign Physicians reckoned amongst the <HI>Acidulae,</HI> or sour Wells or Waters; I take the more Notice of this, because I gave a Glass of it to more than one of my Friends, who were surprized at the Quickness of the Tast, and called it sharp or <HI>acid;</HI> but when I made them drink another Glass, and con∣sider it better, they were forced to re∣cant, and confess that the smart and brisk Tast had misled them to call it acid or sour. Thus Cyder and soft Ale when bottled, may give a smart and acute Impression to the Palate, tho' very far from being sour; and even Spirits, or volatile Alkalies of <HI>Sal Armo∣niac</HI> or of <HI>Hartshorn,</HI> when mixt with Water, do cause a smart and pungent Affection on the Tongue; which is far from being <HI>acid.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
<P>But to bring this to a yet further Trial, whether an <HI>Acidity</HI> was preva∣lent, or so much as to be found in these Waters, we dropt a good Proportion of Spirit of <HI>Hartshorn</HI> and Spirit of <HI>Sal Armoniac</HI> into these Waters, and did not find the least Luctation or Motion appear, as they usually do with an <HI>acid.</HI></P>
<P>I made a yet more critical and cer∣tain Examen of the <HI>Acidity</HI> said to be found in <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, by mixing them with Milk in various Measures and Proportions, and I also gave vari∣ous Degrees of Heat to them, some were tried in a tepid or lukewarm, o∣thers in a boyling Heat, but did not curdle the Milk at all; on the contrary, the Waters preserved the Milk for 4 or 5 Days from curdling, or being sour; which strong <HI>Alkalies</HI> will do in like Manner. These Experiments do suffi∣ciently prove, that our <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters do not contain an <HI>acid.</HI></P>
<P>I often made these following Experi∣ments to prove the chalybeat Proper∣ties or Vertues of these Waters in my own private Room, and shewed them to some Friends: According to the common way of trying chalybeat Wa∣ters,
<PB N="5" REF="19"/>I put a small Quantity of pouder'd Gall, about half a Grain or less, to half a Pint of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water, and stirr'd it a∣bout so as to make a sudden Mixture, and it did in a Moment give a deep Purple Colour; but if you drop the Powder gently on the Surface of the Water, it will make a very fine Blue Tincture, more pleasant to the Spectator, but far from be∣ing so curious as the following Tincture.</P>
<P>We took 4 or 5 Leaves of strong Green Tea, placed them in the Bottom of a Glass, holding a quarter of a Pint, and pouring on the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water, and stirred it not at all, we observed these Leaves to unfold themselves, and gra∣dually tinge these Waters with a fine caeruleous azure Blue, few Vegetables do afford the like: Note, that if these, or any other Stipticks, (which are the Praecipitators) do continue long in the Water, they give a deeper Purple, and even at length an <HI>Atramentarius</HI> Colour.</P>
<P>There is another Property in these Waters, which makes them more useful to us than any Foreign Chalybeat Wa∣ters we yet know, that is, they do car∣ry better, and keep their Vertue long∣er, are not so soon spoil'd by any acci∣dental Insinuations of the Air, as <HI>Spa,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="20"/>and other Iron or Chalybeat Waters are apt to be. The Mineral is here tho∣roughly well united and mixt with this Water, so that it does not easily precipitate, or separate from the Water; it carries also a much greater Quantity of the Steel, or (as some call it) Vitrio∣lic Quality in it; and for these Reasons does the better pass the <HI>Vasa Lactea,</HI> and communicate with the Blood it self, and work the more considerable Effects.</P>
<P>That these <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters do hold their Vertue beyond any other we know of, appear'd to me, because there was not one of those I open'd, (some of which were kept the whole Winter,) that diminished any Thing of the strong Iron or Steel Tast. Moreover, I made this Experiment; I suffered a Bottle, or Flask of <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, being about half full, to be unstopp'd, and exposed to the Air for 12 Hours; I examined it, and it did neither tinge nor tast of the Mineral, but was insipid; but the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, exposed just after the same Manner, did tast strong of the Mineral, nay, they continued to do so, and to give the Tincture to Galls for 2 Days, and perhaps might have done so longer, but I thought that suffic'd.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
<P>In Order to the making good, or prov∣ing what has been asserted in the Account of the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, These Experiments were made at a full Meeting of the Fellows of the Royal Society, <HI>February</HI> the 28th, 17 16/17. Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> President, being in the Chair.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT I might the better con∣vince the worthy Members of the Royal Society, of the promising Ex∣cellencies and Vertues of these Waters, (for very few had ever tasted them be∣fore,) I brought a Bottle full of <HI>Pyr∣mont</HI> Waters that held above Two Quarts, which I had kept since <HI>August</HI> last; The Weather being very cold, I placed the Bottle so near the Fire, as to give it a little Warmth, or to damask it, as they do to Wine; The Bottle being open'd, the Water immediately made a visible Ebullition, but not so much as it did in Summer, and being poured out, did sparkle in the Glass: I presented a Glass of it to the President, he said it was highly Chalybeat, and of a brisk and grateful Tast. Most, if not all the Gentlemen present, tasted the Waters,
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>did all agree with the President, That they were a strong Chalybeat, or Steel Water, and of a pleasant Tast; but a∣mongst the rest, Doctor <HI>Douglas,</HI> a learn∣ed Physician, declared, that his Glass of Water (which was a good large one) did give a very kind and comfortable Warmth to his Stomach, which made him infer, that it would prove of great Use, and be a notable Stomachick Me∣dicine. I often found it to affect my Stomach, much as it did his; but he proves a better Judge, because he has avoided drinking Wine for many Years past. This being done,</P>
<P N="2">2. I opened a Flask of the best <HI>Spa</HI> Waters I could get, which being pour'd into the Glass, was presented also to the President, but had a very small and low Tast of the Chalybeat, (and was judged so not only by him, but the rest who tasted it) when compared with the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters.</P>
<P N="3">3. I also demonstrated in their Presence the Experiments abovementioned, by putting 4 or 5 Leaves of Tea to a Glass of these Waters, and about half a Grain of Galls to another, which presented them with a curious Blue or Purple
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>Colour; that with Tea exceeded in Beauty the other.</P>
<P>In Reference to the Experiment a∣bovementioned, as to the way of pre∣serving these Waters, it is now perform∣ed to more Advantage after this Man∣ner: I fill'd a Pint Bottle of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters out of my great Bottle, which being well stopp'd, was put into the Custody of the Curator, who brought it forth the next Meeting, being full 7 Days, and then was found to hold a strong Chalybeat Tast, and did tinge with Galls. It will prove a hard Mat∣ter to make the <HI>Spa</HI> Water hold 7 Hours after this way of Management; So that on this Account these Waters have some considerable Advantage, because many Persons cannot drink above half a Flask at a Time of the <HI>Spa</HI> Water, by the next Morning the Remainder does lose all its Vertue, and will tast much like common Water.</P>

<HEAD>The Testimony of the President and some of the Fellows of the College of Physicians.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>IN the College of Physicians, at a Meet∣ing of the Electors, a Bottle of</HI> Pyr∣mont <HI>Waters was opened and tasted, and much commended for its promising Vertue, and was allowed much to excel the</HI> Spa <HI>Water, (being examined at the same time) both as to a more vigorous and medicinal Tast, and other Experiments made before them.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>This was attested By the most Learned Dr. <HI>Bateman,</HI> President, And by several of the Electors then present.</SIGNED>
<DATE><HI>March</HI> 4. 17 16/17</DATE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>At the reading my first Account which I gave of the Vertue of the <HI>Py∣mour</HI> Waters, it was discoursed and ar∣gued, that they contain'd a purging
<PB N="11" REF="25"/>Quality in them, which is not only asserted by Authors, but even by those that have actually drank them, who have positively assur'd me, that they did purge them. For my Part, I much questioned this general Effect of any Chalybeat Water, and so soon as I drank them my self, I found th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> con∣trary, which was more agreeable to the several Sorts of Steel Waters, whose Nature and Properties I have examin'd, and are Printed by Sir <HI>Hans Sloan,</HI> in, the Transactions. See<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 28. p. 247</NOTE></P>
<P>Now to bring this to a fair Trial, whether any purging Ingredient can be found in these Waters, I made this Experiment.</P>
<P>I evaporated a Quart of these Waters <HI>ad siccitatem,</HI> and then poured upon this Remainder some Rain Water, enough to dissolve and take up the Salts; and then having filter'd this Solution, I then by a moderate Heat exhal'd the Water, which contain'd about 4 Grains of a brackish Salt, more like Sea Salt, than that of the purging Waters. We may safely conclude, that so small a Quan∣tity
<PB N="12" REF="26"/>of Salt in a Quart of Water, can by no Means be imagined to cause the least Purgation, no not in an Infant; For since we have separated the Salts out of the Purging Waters, and brought them into common Practice, we do find by Experience, that 2 Drams, or 120 Grains, dissolved in a Quart of com∣mon Water, purges very little; and that a whole Ounce of the true genuine Salts, is but a usual Dose.</P>
<P>I have made it more than probable, in a former Examen of Steel Waters;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for</HI> 1713. p. 249.</NOTE> That Chalybeat Waters do contain stiptic and restringent Qualities in them, and that they are derived from Iron Minerals, and more particularly the Pyrites, which Doctor <HI>Lister</HI> suggests, (not without Reason) to be the Parent of all Iron Oar. I have often examin'd at <HI>Deptford</HI> the Solution of the Pyrites by Rain Water, out of which Copperas or Vitriol is made, and found it to be a very strong Chalybeat Water: From this Mineral of Iron we have our strong stiptic Powders and Waters to stop Bleedings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for external and inter∣nal
<PB N="13" REF="27"/>Use. A judicious Use of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> and <HI>Spa</HI> Waters hath cured obstinate and inveterate Diarraeas, which did not yield to the Force of all other Medi∣cines.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding our arguing to the contrary, it will De retorted upon us, that there is Matter of Fact and Experience against us, <HI>that they really do purge at</HI> Pyrmont, where they are drank: This Effect I soon conjectured to be due to some irregular, or immoderate Use of these Waters; for I found above Thirty Years past, the same Effect at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> on those that drank the Wa∣ters hastily and in profuse Quantities; they caused Giddiness, Sickness, Vomit∣ings, and Purgings; but since our Phy∣sicians have corrected these Irregula∣rities, we hear of no such Complaint; for all agree that these Waters are bind∣ing, and oft require opening Medicines. Now I am well informed at <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> that they are ordered to drink large Quantities, oft three or four Quarts or more of our <HI>English</HI> Measure, and that pretty hastily; which makes it no Won∣der that their Weight presses and forces them thorough the Bowels, because a much less Quantity of Rain, Pump, or
<PB N="14" REF="28"/>Spring Water, do purge of themselves, as I have experienced in my self a few Days past for the Cure of a <HI>Cardialgia,</HI> two Quarts being drank hastily gave me about six Dejections; whereas if you drink these or any Chalybeat Waters leisurely, and in just Quantities, they will pass off as they should, by Urine only. And herein lies the Intention and great Use of these altering Waters, which is to temper and meliorate the State of the Blood, for they ought to prove a Cordial, and give Strength to the weak and depressed Spirits; but if they chance to purge, the Patient will soon complain that he loses Ground, and must use Means to check any Di∣arraea, and to make the Waters go the right way by Urine, which he then finds will do him good, and produce the desired Effect.</P>
<P>I am informed by a learned Physician, an <HI>English</HI> Archiater to our Sovereign, That it seemed strange to several of the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water Drinkers of his Ac∣quaintance at Court, that any one should doubt of the purging Quality of those Waters: I have my self also been told by more than one Physician, that have been there upon the Place,
<PB N="15" REF="29"/>That if they do not purge with us here, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey must have lost that Quality by Carriage. But this I can further prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be a Mistake from manifest Argu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents.</P>
<P>Only let me first premise, that <HI>Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and</HI> abounds with Purging Waters more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han other Countries; for there is scarce County that has not some of them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd I am confident, that within Twen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Miles of <HI>London,</HI> we have at least a Dozen I could name; and there may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e twice as many for ought I know. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do also premise, that since the happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oundation of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> (whose Motto is, <HI>Nullius in Verba</HI>) all Sorts of Waters have been more carefully ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erimented, and their Properties dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overed, and this has been done so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icely by Dr. <HI>Lister,</HI> a great Virtuoso, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he has found the Purging Salts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o differ from all other Species of Salts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to be the same in all Purging Wa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, to have their own proper and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eculiar Figure, to be a <HI>Sal sui Generis.</HI> Doctor <HI>Grew,</HI> by its bitter Tast, calls it <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Catharticum Amarum;</HI> and it plainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppears to be the only purging Salt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f our <HI>English</HI> Springs. The last named Dr. <HI>Grew,</HI> an ancient and early Fellow
<PB N="16" REF="30"/>of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> has ushered this Medicine into the World, by bringing it into a dry Salt; and recommending it into the <HI>Materia Media,</HI> which is now of great Use to Mankind, is carried into remote Countries, even to the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies,</HI> is the cheapest and most general Purge of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>This premis'd, I have hinted above, that a Quart of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water has very little real Salt of any Kind, not enough to purge a Sparrow, and has little or none at all of the Purging Cathartick Salt to be found in it, so that it cannot purge, no, not even when drawn fresh out of the Well, and drank rationally, that is, mo∣derately: Nor is the Argument of any Validity, that it loses its purging Fa∣culty by Carriage; because the purging Salt is a fixt Salt, and will carry as far as the <HI>Indies,</HI> as well as Salt Petre, or our common Kitchin Salt will do; nay, will carry all the World over, and lose nothing of its Vertue, though it be ex∣posed to -the open Air, or dissolv'd in Water, being dried up it recovers a∣gain.</P>
<P>If I may be any tolerable Judge my self, who am easily wrought upon by any Lenitives, I do vouch, that the
<PB N="17" REF="31"/><HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters have no laxative Ope∣ration at all on me. The same Ac∣count I have from a learned Divine, who assur'd me, that he found no purg∣ing Quality in the Use of them; We both drank them the last Year. I do farther venture to prognostick, (and to my great Satisfaction of their greater Vertue) That they will not purge them who shall drink a Flask of these Wa∣ters, containing the Quantity of a <HI>Spa</HI> Flask; nay, I may venture to say, two of those Flasks, if not drank hastily, nor with too much Motion.</P>
<P>Since I am upon the Topick of Purg∣ing, and we are mighty apt amongst us, I mean the Ignorant, to talk much of carrying off some Reliques of Diseas∣es, perhaps of Fevers; which, I fear, are oft done precipitantly, and do bring on Relapses. This brings to my Mind the Practice at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> for about 40 Years past, when I frequented those Waters, That they did not only pre∣pare the Patient by Purges, for his Course of Drinking, which was very convenient, but they did give strong Purges at the Conclusion of their Drink∣ing. That sagacious and considering Physician, Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> (in whose Fa∣vour
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>I had some Interest) charg'd me to have a Care of being misled into that Errour; assuring me, That this Practice would destroy and carry off all the Strength and Vertue the Patient gain'd in a Month's Drinking. He gave me a parallel Instance in the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark, which sustain'd the same Damage by Purging, and it is disallowed of every where by the Skilful; and yet we have in both these Cases, some very ignorant, but confident Pretenders to Physick, who aver, That the Bark, as well as Steel Waters, do leave behind them malignant and dangerous Quali∣ties, if not carried off by Purging Me∣dicines: Which Practice is generally laid aside by the Learned Physicians in <HI>England,</HI> and I hope in other Countries.</P>
<P>There is one Method also has been made Use of at <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> and other of the Mineral Waters, which to me seems erroneous and dangerous, and ought to be consider'd and examin'd, whether it does not cause some very bad Effects, and that is, as I am told, the Physicians do order their Patients, with their Bel∣lies full of Water, to walk up and down hastily, and to bestir themselves very nimbly: And I am also told from very
<PB N="19" REF="33"/>good Authority, That it is common to forbid such the Use of the Waters, who through Lameness, or other Impedi∣ments, are disabled from Action or nimble Motion: But in <HI>England</HI> we often find the contrary Method necessa∣ry, especially in tender and infirm Con∣stitutions, in whom the Operations of Medicines are most conspicuous and distinguish'd, for these do feel the good Effects of being very still and sedate, of being quiet both in Body and Mind: Of this the late Queen <HI>Anne</HI> was an e∣minent Instance, who could never drink <HI>Tunbridge, Bath,</HI> or any other Di∣uretick Waters, but in her Bed; which has been the Case of many others of my own Friends, with whom they would not agree, nor pass off, if they walk'd with them, or took them in any other Posture than lying. I am far from pre∣scribing this Way promiscuously, and to all Sorts of People, doubtless mode∣rate walking may agree with many; I have known where riding, after the Waters have been pretty well gone off, has done no Harm; but I found in my self, when young and strong, very ill Effects in Riding too soon after I had drank a Quantity of Mineral Waters,
<PB N="20" REF="34"/>that my Legs swell'd, and an <HI>Erysipelas</HI> attended that Swelling.</P>
<P>An Anatomist, who well considers, that the Waters must circulate through the Heart with the Blood, and from thence up and down through an Abun∣dance of ascending as well as descending Windings and Turnings, he will say, that the upright or erect Posture will appear less likely to facilitate the Cir∣culation of the Blood, now loaded with Water, than the Horizontal Posture of lying on a Couch or a Bed does: Experi∣ence it self confirms the Truth of this, not only of my own, but of many other Water-Drinkers, of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> as well as of the <HI>Bath,</HI> &amp;c. whose Waters have not pass'd to any Degree in the Day∣time, but these have gone off very plen∣tifully at Night in their Beds. I have for many Years past recommended a large Glass of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters to my Friends, to be constantly taken in their Beds every Night; for which Draught I have had the Thanks of many, but never heard of any Harm received.</P>
<P>As a farther Argument against much Morion, when we drink the Chalybeat Waters, (especially since they are gene∣rally us'd in hot Weather) we must
<PB N="21" REF="35"/>avoid all Methods that provoke Sweat, or dispose us to a quick Perspiration through the cutaneous Glands, which we plainly feel and observe to be caused by much Agitation or Walking, and by that Means the Current of the Wa∣ters is diverted from its natural and proper Channel, and hinder'd from pas∣sing by Urine, which ought to be in∣couraged.</P>
<P>I now appeal to the Judgment of the most wise and learned Persons of this Honourable Society, who have been the Authors of so much Good to Mankind; whether these Arguments for regulating the Use of these noble medical Waters, have not some Weight, and may not deserve to be consider'd, and not con∣demn'd untry'd: This I am sure, that this Method is no wise hazardous to the Lives of Men; whereas the great Weight and Load of Water in the Blood, (for all Persons cannot throw them off <HI>per Sedem</HI>) must needs produce some ill Effects. The great Quantity may too much extend and spoil the Stomach, may cause Diseases of the Head, Vertigo's, Apoplexies, break down the Lymphaeducts, and make an <HI>Ascitis,</HI> the worst of Dropsies; and cause
<PB N="22" REF="36"/>those very Diseases, which a moderate Use would certainly cure.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be looked upon as an Omission, for having taken no mow Notice of the fixed Parts, or of the Ingredients which are to be found in all Chalybeat Waters, and therefore in the <HI>Pyrmont.</HI> For I mention only a small Quantity of Water evaporated <HI>ad siccitatem,</HI> and I have made Use only of the watry Element to dissolve the Salts, and examine their Figure and Tast, that I might reduce them to their pro∣per Species of Salts. As to the Salts, I never fail'd of a <HI>Sal Marine,</HI> but found it in all Sorts of Mineral Waters, (tho' in some in very small Quantity,) which is not to be wondred at, since 'tis very probable, that our Fountains and Wells may owe their Original to the Sea; and so may not altogether strain off all, and clear themselves, by Transcola∣tion through the Earth, of every saline Particle. Moreover, the Earth it self does not only furnish whole Hills or Rocks of Salt, but has smaller Veins, and even Grains of Salt scatter'd up and down, which are again absorb'd by small Rivulets, or Currents of Water, and do in more or less Quantity impreg∣nate
<PB N="23" REF="37"/>stagnating Wells, or flowing Foun∣tains.</P>
<P>I have indeed formerly examin'd the Remains or fixt Parts of many of our ferruginous Waters; I have generally found them much the same, for all of them do contain Iron Particles; but those that abounded most with Sedi∣ment, held a crude gross Ocre, and would give the deepest and blackest Tincture to the Water, and had the least Vertue in them. The Chymist having collected a good deal of this Substance, makes it pass through many a fiery Trial by Calcination, Reverbe∣ration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at length he brings forth a Powder of a Reddish or deep Yellow, and shall adorn it with a fine Name, perhaps he will call it a <HI>Crocus Martis,</HI> or a Saffron of Steel; (this Name he borrows from one of our most excel∣lent Vegetables, <HI>Saffron,</HI>) or else his Fancy shall run upon another Notion, and shall call it a <HI>Sulphur</HI> of <HI>Mars;</HI> and not rest here, but endeavour to make up the Three Chymical Principles, namely, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury; he will call it Sulphur, though it be in∣combustible; it must be a Salt, though it be undissolvable; and a Mercury,
<PB N="24" REF="38"/>although it look like a Gravel Stone. To what Purpose all this Labour and Pains? whereas,</P>
<P N="1">1. The very Tast tells us, that the <HI>Spa</HI> Waters are impregnated with Cha∣lybeat or Iron Particles.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Eyes will tell us, that we may see Iron in these Waters to a Demon∣stration; if you put a little Powder or Solution of Galls to these Waters, it gives a black Colour, and will make Ink. Now since we have in <HI>England</HI> not any one Thing that gives a black Colour, or is dyed black, but what comes from Iron; none will doubt at first Sight of this Experiment, whether the Waters do belong to the Iron Ori∣ginal or no. In <HI>England</HI> we abound much with the <HI>Pyrites,</HI> or Copperas Stone, out of this we make great Quan∣tity of this Copperas, which is almost all Iron. The Dyers make Use of it to give the black to Woollen, Linen, Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by boiling it in Water with Galls, and without it we can't give a good black to one Yard of Cloth.</P>
<P>To me these two easy and sensible Experiments, made with little Cost and Trouble, do as plainly exhibit the Iron Quality, as if I had evaporated some
<PB N="25" REF="39"/>Gallons of these Waters, and had pas∣sed the Recrements through Chymical Fires, and had with a Loadstone (as I have done formerly in the like Case) taken up the very Substance of Iron.</P>
<P>But after all these pompous and ela∣borate Experiments, by which we pre∣tend to examine and analize these ex∣cellent Waters, we must return to the Waters themselves, whose Vertue lies in their <HI>Synthesi,</HI> or natural Constitution in the Form of Waters: As such, let us endeavour to make them as useful as possible; for without all doubt, they do contain Medicines adapted to the Cure of many Diseases, which will suc∣ceed more effectually, if the Physicians, especially he that practises at the Foun∣tain Head, do abound in Piety and Charity.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let him not disparage the mu∣nificent Author of this great Medicine, for its not being made by the Hands of proud or weak Man: Let him not say, as some Wretches have done, that these Waters are only a good Vehicle for his own wiser and better Compositi∣ons; but rather let him ascribe to the
<PB N="26" REF="40"/>great Founder of these noble Medicines, the due Tribute of Thanks and Praise.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let his Charity be expressed to his Neighbour, by applying these Waters with the utmost Care and Skill he can, by giving them after a due Manner, in just Proportion and Quantity, and not pour into the Stomach whole Deluges of Water, to break down Nature's Boundaries; but setting aside all Prejudi∣ces and Self-Ends, let him regard what Symptoms they best relieve, and what stubborn Diseases they most effectually cure. Let him not, from a vain and ambitious Conceit, pretend to improve these Waters, by adding some Chymi∣cal Drops or Fancies of his own; for these often give a nauseous Tast to the grateful Waters, and may not only de∣fraud the Drinker of his pleasant Draught, but also of the superiour Vertue inhe∣rent in the Waters themselves. This Method is too much practis'd amongst us, and often injuriously, and deserves to be censured.</P>
</DIV1>

<PB N="27" REF="41"/>
<HEAD>A List of some of those Diseases, which Chalybeat Waters are prescrib'd to cure.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THEY are a proper Remedy for most Diseases of the Stomach, as Want of Appetite, or Defects of Digestion from Weakness or Relaxation of the Fibres of the Stomach; also ca∣nine and excessive Appetites, sour and bitter Vomitings, Heart-burning, or <HI>Cardialgia,</HI> and many other Stomach Di∣stempers.</P>
<P N="2">2. Diseases of the Bowels, such as painful and griping Colicks proceeding from corrosive or fretting Salts, contain∣ed in the bilious, or other glandulous Juices of the Bowels; these are diluted, alter'd, or sweetned by the Chalybeat Virtue of these healing Waters; and the Chyle it self is better prepar'd and elaborated in the Region of the Bowels, and being freed from distemper'd Qua∣lities, is convey'd into the Blood, better adapted for Sanguification. In Hypo∣condriack Diseases, where pent up Va∣pours and flatulent Humours rack and lacerate the tender Fibres and Mem∣branes
<PB N="28" REF="42"/>of the Stomach and Bowels, these salutiferous Waters are esteem'd specifick.</P>
<P N="3">3. Their Vertue is not confin'd to those Parts called the <HI>primae viae,</HI> or first <HI>apparatus</HI> of the Chyle, but extends farther, even penetrates the Mass of Blood, and is of manifest Use to cure the Jaundice, and even Dropsies, (if not too far gone.) It dilutes and washes the Scorbutick Salts out of the Blood, and at the same time washes off the Gravel, and smaller Stones collected in the Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder, and prevents their Concretions in those Parts again. By them the latent Seeds of many Dis∣eases fixt in the Organisk Parts, such as the most sagacious Physician cannot perceive, are carried off, or obliterated in their Original. Sickly and squalid Countenances, visible Indications of a deprav'd State of Health, shall, after a convenient Use of these Waters, look healthful and sanguine: By these the very Texture of the Blood is mended, drooping Spirits are cheer'd, exhilirated, and enabled to do the various Offices of Nature more strenuously, and they affect our Spirits with a much more
<PB N="29" REF="43"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind and benign Influence, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eating, ruffling, or inflaming them, which Wine and Artificial Spirits are apt to do. I should rather trust to these for the Cure of a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> by what I have seen in my self, than to the in∣sipid and scarce tepid Waters of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>I have now given a short Hint only of some few of those Diseases for which these Waters are proper; Time would fail me to enumerate them all.</P>
<P>This gives a great Reputation unto the Excellency of these Waters, that when Physicians have in vain applied their own Preparations to obtain a Cure, they are forced to fly to these Divine Remedies, and do very often find their Account here.</P>
<P>Since it is agreed, by the general Consent and Experience of Nations, to ascribe extraordinary Vertues to these Sorts of Fountains that are impregnated with Chalybeat Particles, and there∣fore are called Steel Waters; I hope I have done <HI>this my Native Country,</HI> not only a Piece of Justice, but an accept∣able Service, in these my Endeavours to recommend to them these particular Waters of <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> especially since it appears, that they do in many Degrees
<PB N="30" REF="44"/>surpass any of our own Waters, in their Medicinal Properties, or any others that are brought to us from Foreign Parts.</P>
<P>There are some particular Advanta∣ges and Privileged which belong to this Chalybeat Fountain, for this Spring abounds with a vast Quantity of Water, it is more portable, carries, and holds its Vertue better than any other; I have kept it a Summer and Winter without Decay; it is scituated as near the Sea Side as any Foreign Water, and requires less Land Carriage; and, I doubt not in Time, so soon as a Trade is settled, it will be brought over much cheaper than any Sort of Foreign Wa∣ter from Abroad.</P>
<P>It can be no Objection to me against these <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, which I find some have complain'd of beyond the Sea, that these are too heavy and too strong of the Mineral. I do allow them to contain a very great Proportion of that Ingredient in them, as a Proof of their Excellency; for the Mineral here is not a gross and heavy Ocre, but finely re∣ctified and exalted; a Vitriol (not to be match'd by humane Art) well dissolv'd in its watry Vehicle. For Want of In∣struments,
<PB N="31" REF="45"/>I could not make the Experi∣ment so very nice, but yet I found that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Waters of this Spring were not at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll more (but rather less) ponde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han common Rain Water, as to the Specifick Gravity.</P>
<P>We may allow that these Waters may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e too strong for some weak Stomachs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his is easily remedied by mixing a just Proportion of good fair Water with it. We must not condemn good strong Wine because some Constitutions can't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear it by its self, but when mix'd with Water it proves a great Cordial.</P>
<P>It was a great Satisfaction to me to have this Notion confirm'd by the most Learned Archiater to King <HI>George,</HI> Dr. <HI>Steigerthall,</HI> a Fellow of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of the College of Physician; who cur'd a tender Lady labouring under se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eral desperate Distempers, (when, she could not bear the Water of the Well) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y mixing equal Parts of simple Water with the <HI>Pyrmontane.</HI> He further recom∣mends this Method to be made Use of by others, if they have any Reason to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uspect these Waters to disagree with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem as being too strong. For my Part, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> think it a great Benefit to us in <HI>Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and,</HI> that we are directed to a Water
<PB N="32" REF="46"/>of a Strength superiour to any in Use amongst us, which I hope, and am per∣swaded, will rejoice the Hearts, and ani∣mate the drooping Spirits of many a sad and hypocondriack Soul; for whom most of our Chalybeats are found too weak.</P>
<P>It is a strong Argument that Cha∣lybeat Waters, particularly the <HI>Spa,</HI> have given great Satisfaction, and done much good, because they have been much more prescrib'd and us'd amongst us of late Years than formerly; and they would still be in greater Vogue if they were not adulterated, or if the true Waters from the <HI>Spa</HI> could be brought to us in Perfection with their original Strength, which (I am sorry to say) can rarely be brought to pass. On the other Hand, those of <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> with but a very moderate Care in stopping, can scarce fail of being delivered to us in their full Strength. I am fully per∣swaded that Experience will soon evince and demonstrate the Truth of this Assertion.</P>
<P>It is another Misfortune, that the Chalybeat Fountains of Water, such as <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> &amp;c. can be only applied to in the warm Weather, for four or five
<PB N="33" REF="47"/>Months in the Year; but since these Waters, (which were brought before the <HI>Royal Society</HI> in Winter) after they were a little warm'd by the Fire, did then give very good Proof of their admira∣ble Vertue, we may hence be secur'd of their being like to be brought into Use, even in the severest Winters.</P>
<P>I cannot pass by a Proposition of the a∣bovenamed Learned Physician, Dr. <HI>Stei∣gerthall,</HI> my worthy Friend, who, in a curi∣ous Tract of his, gives an Account of great Variety of Waters in <HI>Germany</HI> and other Places, and particularly mentions this, That at <HI>Swalbach,</HI> when the Weather is cold, they bring the Waters to the Fire, and warm them before they drink them: He proposes the making these Waters warm by an ignited Rod or Gad of Iron; the Doctor confesses with great Modesty that he never made the Ex∣periment, but to me it seems so ratio∣nal, that it ought to be taken Notice of; and that it may be made practical, give me leave to add these Directions. Take a small Bar or Rod of Iron, about a Foot long, fit a wooden Handle to one End, to be put on or off at Dis∣cretion, pour off half a Pint of Water out of the Flask, into a convenient Ves∣sel
<PB N="34" REF="48"/>of Silver or China, not of Glass, plunge the ignited Iron into the Water, bring the Water to a very low Degree of Heat; when you pour off more out of the Flask, get your Heaters always rea∣dy. In this Experiment you lose none of the Chalybeat Vertue of the Waters, but rather receive an Addition from the heated Iron. You obviate another Inconvenience, when a whole Flask is warmed in boiling Water, as we use the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, it will be apt to de∣spirit and make the whole Bottle flat and lifeless. But this Way may these <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters in the coldest Seasons of the Year be drank, with the same Vertue, and therefore with as much Benefit as in Summer, nay, perhaps with many People to better Advantage; The Waters being more likely to pass off by Urine in cold Weather, than in the hot Summer.</P>
<P>Whereas I have animadverted above upon the great Quantity of Waters that are drank, at the sour Brunns or <HI>Acidulae</HI> (so called) abroad, it seemed to me in∣credible that any Person should drink for several Days successively, such an extravagant Quantity as that of six or seven Quarts of our <HI>English</HI> Measure,
<PB N="35" REF="49"/>which I now no more doubt of, having read it in Dr. <HI>Steigerthall</HI>'s ingenious Treatise; though I am very well as∣sured, that it was never done with his Advice, nor with his Approbation. It is the more surprising to us, because we do see very good Effects of a single Flask of <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, (when they are good, that is, brisk and vigorous) in recovering Health, provided they are continued for near a Month more or less. One of these Flasks does not fully contain a Quart and half of <HI>English</HI> Measure. It must be allow'd, that there may be now and then a Case extraordinary, which will require greater Quantities than what is usual, but rarely any Thing so ex∣cessive as what is here mentioned: A∣mongst our <HI>Bath</HI> Patients, the Quantity of Two of our Quarts is esteem'd a large Proportion; and most abide at One, or Three Pints: And Two Quarts of the Chalybeat are reckon'd a large Dose, and to be allow'd to only very strong Persons.</P>

The Learned <HI>Ger¦mans,</HI> when they name them, or writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them, do call them <HI>Acidulae,</HI> Ex. gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Spadenses, Swalbaccenses, vel Pyrmonta∣nae,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>&amp;c. <HI>Henricus ab Heers</HI> agrees with <HI>Vitruvius, Fallopius,</HI> and the sagacious <HI>Helmont,</HI> and other Men of great Fame, in justifying the Acidity of several Sorts of <HI>Spa</HI> and Chalybeat Waters; but not being satisfy'd with their Reasons, as∣signs others; and after a tedious and obscure Harangue, concludes, that they owe their Birth and great Vertues to Vitriol and Sulphur. He observes, that Vitriol and Sulphur are found in the Glebe or Earth, from whence these Wa∣ters do spring, but yet does not give us one Proof or Experiment of his hav∣ing found any real Vitriol, or true Sul∣phur, or any Acidity in those Waters. He fills his Book with Imaginations and Quotations, exposing other Mens Ignorance, whilst he himself is plunged in the same common vulgar Errour.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Jordis,</HI> an eminent Physician at <HI>Francford,</HI> and a Fellow of the <HI>Roy∣al Society,</HI> did formerly visit the famous Well or sour Brunn at <HI>Swalbach</HI> in Sum∣mer time, and practised there during the Season: I was my self then exa∣mining the Nature of all Sorts of Wa∣ters, Cathartick and Chalybeat, or Steel Waters, and the other which contain the bitter purging Salts; my Request to
<PB N="38" REF="52"/>this very Learned Physician was, That he would give me an Account of the Contents of the said Water, number'd amongst the <HI>Acidulae;</HI> particularly, whe∣ther by Distillation he could obtain any Thing sour or acid, as Vinegar and Juice of Oranges will do this Way; but he could not satisfy me that the least Drop of acid did rise, or distil over. He also evaporated a great Quantity of this Water <HI>ad siccitatem,</HI> and thought that he found some Sulphureous Parts in it; but Sulphur it self is far from being an acid, but the contrary. He also found Ocre and other ferrugineous Particles contain'd in it, but these we find in all Chalybeat Waters, which do truly belong to the Nature of Al∣kalis, and not of Acids.</P>
<P>That which gave me the first Suspi∣cion, that the Chalybeat Waters did not contain any rough or acid Salts in them, proceeded from an accidental Use of a very strong Iron Water, which happen'd to me above Thirty Years ago, in such a Place, where I could get no other: In this Water I dissolved my Soap, washed my Hands, and found it to la∣ther beyond my Expectation, I also shaved with it. I afterwards tried some
<PB N="39" REF="53"/>other Chalybeat Waters, which did the same, that is, much better than Pump Water did.</P>
<P N="1">I. I consulted my Palate, and tri∣ed whether I could discover any Sharp∣ness or Acidity in our <HI>English</HI> Steel Waters at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> at the <HI>Black-Boy</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Franfield</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> at <HI>Hampstead, Sunning-Hill</HI> in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> and other Places; But I was so far from discovering any such Thing, that these Waters seem'd rather to leave a sweetish Flavour or Farewel behind: Thus many Alkaly Salts, if nicely exa∣mined, (of the fixed Kind) have affect∣ed my Tast.</P>
<P N="2">II. I made Experiments with seve∣ral Sorts of such Spirits as are apt to ferment with Acids, such as Spirit of <HI>Hartshorn,</HI> of <HI>Sal Armoniac,</HI> &amp;c. but these made no Ferment, nor any Motion, or Effervescence in these Wa∣ters.</P>
<P N="3">III. I considered the Diseases in Humane Bodies, which those Waters were prescribed by Physicians to cure; That they were often such as proceed∣ed
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>from sharp, acid, or acrimonious Causes, as <HI>Cardialgia,</HI> or Heart Burn∣ings, sour Vomitings, corrosive Diar∣raea's, Colicks from Scurvies and Stran∣guries; and that for these Distempers sweetning and alkalisate Remedies are made Use of.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I consider'd these Waters as con∣taining in them the Properties of Iron, and I find by Experience, that it is most opposite to Acids, being one of their great Correctors; and therefore rather to be esteemed an Alkaly.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take some Filings of Iron, per∣haps a Dram, and pour on them about an Ounce of the milder Acids, such as Vinegar, Verjuice, or the Juice of Li∣mons, and it will destroy the Sharp∣ness of these Juices: Or if you pour on these Filings, Mineral Acids, as the very corrosive Spirit of Nitre, or of Salt, or what is called Oil of Vitriol, they will immediately lose their Aci∣dity, be disarm'd of their sharp Points, and by Evaporation give a Salt that will tast sweetish, and is by Chymists called <HI>Saccharum Martis,</HI> if duly pre∣pared,
<PB N="41" REF="55"/>which is safely given inwardly, and is esteemed a good altering Medi∣cine.</P>
<P N="2">2. Steel beaten to a fine Powder, is without any farther Preparation given inwardly with great Success for Stomachick Diseases, as in the Green-Sickness, Hypocondriack, and various other acid and acrimonious Disaffecti∣ons.</P>
<P N="5">V. I considered Milk to be a very proper and obvious Subject to bring this Controversy to a plain and unquestio∣nable Decision. I made this Experi∣ment with all possible Exactness: I first proved the Chalybeat Waters, more particularly the <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, by trying whether, they tinged with Galls. These being very good, I put Part of the Waters to cold Milk, some I only made Lukewarm, and some I boiled together in equal Proportions; But they were so far from affording any Curd or Coagulation, that they conti∣nued several Days without being sour. Since Mineral Waters, especially those that are Chalybeat, are of such impor∣tant
<PB N="42" REF="56"/>Use in Physick, and have gain'd amongst us so just a Reputation for their excellent Vertues, and are the greatest Refuge in very potent and ob∣stinate Diseases; This has made me judge it a Work not unacceptable to Virtuoso's, especially those of the Fa∣culty of Physick, to have this Medi∣cine fairly examin'd, its genuine Pro∣perties asserted, and what was called an Acid, to be demonstrated an Alka∣ly. Is it not a Sort of Justice due to the World, that the <HI>Germans,</HI> who sent us over these Waters, with this false Character of sour Waters, should ba∣nish this misguiding Term from their <HI>Spa's?</HI></P>
<P>It is from this Mistake, that their Physicians do prohibit the Use of all Manner of <HI>Lacticinia,</HI> as if they were as noxious as deadly Poisons, whilst they are in a Course of their Medici∣nal Waters, unjustly called Sour Brunns.</P>
<P>Since this Prejudice has prevailed very much amongst most of our Wa∣ter Drinkers in <HI>England,</HI> I do attest, that I have frequently advis'd in some Cases, Milk to be given daily in the Evening, through a whole Course of
<PB N="43" REF="57"/>Steel Waters, with good Effect: Nay, I do affirm, that some others could not bear these Waters without having a Third Part of Milk or more, mixed with them; and have continued them so for many Weeks with good Advan∣tage: Nor do I find the least Reason to prohibit the Use of Milk in a Course of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, having been there a∣bove a Year and half, making the best Scrutiny I could into the Properties; Vertues, and Vices (if they have any) of those Waters: Here we use Asses Milk Morning and Afternoon in the Use of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters; nor did I ever forbid Cows Milk, where it agreed with that Person, at any other Time.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Since our Experiments disco∣ver, that those Things which are of a sweetning Alkalisate Nature, do so very well agree with these Mineral Waters, it will appear by the following Experiment, that Acids do very much disagree.</P>
<P N="1">1. I put but one Drop of Oil of Vitriol to a large Glass full of strong <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, which, before the Addi∣tion
<PB N="44" REF="58"/>of this Acid, did give a deep Pur∣ple to the Solution of Galls, but now would not give the least Tincture, though I put in Four Times, as much of the Galls: From hence I conclude, That the Vertues of the Chalybeat Ingredients, which I take to be the Life and Soul of these Waters, were so far bound up or destroyed, as to have lost their Cordial, or corrobora∣ting Faculty, and that the Bile or Gall in the Humane Bowels, could not be able to separate the Chalybeat (which are the only medical) Particles, and mix them with the Chyle, in order to an∣swer any End in Physick.</P>
<P>Let this be a Caution to those that design to make these Waters pass better by Urine, that they do not make Use of any Acids, it being a common Pra∣ctice to use Spirit of Vitriol, <HI>Spiritus Nitri dulcis,</HI> &amp;c. as a Diuretick, unless it should so happen, that they have a Design to take off and divest them of their warm Cordial or altering Power, and so to bring them near to common Water; which I must confess we are forc'd to do, especially in the Use of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, in some hot inflammatory Cases.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="59"/>
<P N="2">2. I shall conclude with one short Experiment in Favour of our Alkalies; That if you put any Alkaly Salt, vola∣tile or fixed, such as volatile Salt of <HI>Hartshorn,</HI> or of <HI>Sal Armoniac,</HI> or fixed Salt of <HI>Tartar,</HI> of <HI>Wormwood,</HI> or any other true Alkaly, you will then de∣stroy the abovenamed acid Spirit which was dropt into the Water, and will re∣cover the Vertue of the Waters, and dispose them to give their Tincture as they used to do in their natural State.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT</HEAD>
<P>AFter many fruitless Attempts to get a Book from <HI>Germany,</HI> which treated of these Waters <HI>ex professo,</HI> at length I obtained these Two, of which I shall give a short Account; they did not come to my Hand until my little Tract was finished, and my Papers were actually with the Printer.</P>
<P>The First I shall take Notice of, is one Dr. <HI>Cunaeus,</HI> whose Book was Printed about Seven Years since; of whom I shall have Occasion to say very little, because he treats of many Niceties and Impertinencies to the Cure of Diseases; he enumerates an Abundance of his <HI>Ar∣canum's</HI> and <HI>Nostrum's,</HI> and imputes such extraordinary Vertues to them, which make these sanative Waters, and all o∣ther <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> needless. As to the Nature of the Waters, he had not the least Imagination of their being any Thing else, but an <HI>Acidula,</HI> or sour Brunn; but this mistaken Notion will do less Harm than his Practice did, who,
<PB N="47" REF="61"/>Page 17. directs the Patient at his first Drinking to begin with Two Quarts of the Waters; in another Place he gives a great Charge to the Water-Drinker, to have a great Care of med∣dling with that dangerous Thing Milk, and remarks, that several Children having drank these Waters, upon eating Milk, did fall into Convulsions and other Diseases. He also observes, That seve∣ral Persons who did put Sugar into these sour Waters, and others, who drank a Glass of Wine betwixt their Draughts of Waters, did by this Means fall into dangerous Distempers. As to Milk, not only my own Experience of many Years standing, discharges it from cau∣sing any bad Effects if used the same Day, wherein the Patient drinks Cha∣lybeat Waters, but I have the concur∣ring Testimony of the best of our Phy∣sicians now alive, as well as of many that are lately dead, that they have put their Patients into a Course of joining Milk with our Steel Waters at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and other Places, and have had the good Success of making the Waters agree better with the Patient, and have cur'd that Disease this Way, which they could not do by by the Waters
<PB N="48" REF="62"/>alone. His judging and censuring Su∣gar for having had malignant Influen∣ces on those that dissolve it in these Waters, is absolutely intolerable. Is it possible, that so innocent and pleasant a Balsam can do any Harm? I have several Times caus'd my Patients at the <HI>Bath</HI> to mix fine white Sugar Candy with their Waters with very good Suc∣cess. I little suspected to have a Glass of Wine forbid by a <HI>German,</HI> which I have found a necessary Diuretick for some. The Prohibition of mixing Wine with Chalybeat Waters to be drank at Meals will never take Place in <HI>England,</HI> because both strong and weak, the heal∣thy and sickly, do conspire with us here to drink it mixt at Meals, and declare it to be both pleasant and beneficial. But it is high Time to pass over such Trifles, and to look into the following Author.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Seippius,</HI> appointed by Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> (the Proprietor of these Wa∣tess) to be the only Physician to pra∣ctise at <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> has published his Book this Year, 1717.</P>
<P>This ingenious and very industrious Person has taken much Pains to examine and enquire into the Principles and
<PB N="49" REF="63"/>Operations of these Waters. He has made many curious and useful Experi∣ments, which have led him nearer the Standard of Truth, than any of his Predecessors. For those Contents or Ingredients which he found in the Sedi∣ment of the Water, he is forc'd to con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, that they are all Alkalies, and that hey cannot exert the least acid Effect in the Waters, but rather owns them to have a healing and balsamick Quality; so that in reality he ought to declare him∣self a Proselyte to my new Notion, that even this <HI>Pyrmont</HI> sour Brunn, is a sweet dulcifying Water, and a true Alkaly.</P>
<P>But yet such is the Prejudice of Cu∣stom and common Opinion, that even this candid Author cannot altogether in the first Part of his Tract clear himself of this wrong Notion, of these Waters having an acid or sour Tast, which does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot appear to me, nor to any of my Friends, who attentively consider it. He also thinks, that there is a latent Acid conceal'd in these Waters, and that it comes from the Sulphur of the Pyrites, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom which these medicated Waters are derived; but still he confesses, that this Acid can exert no manner of Effect,
<PB N="50" REF="64"/>being quite subject to those Alkalies con∣tained in the Water.</P>
<P>The Contents of these Waters, he says, are a sweet, subtle, Alkaly Earth, have the Selenites, or somewhat like a transparent Crystal, a small Quantity of Salt, Iron and Sulphur. We do even in our Mineral Waters, especially in that of the <HI>Bath,</HI> find a Sort of a Cretaceous Substance, which we say is from the <HI>Lapis Calcarius;</HI> (with which our Earth in <HI>England</HI> does much abound) and seems to be that very transparent Substance which he calls Selenites, and the sweet Alkaly Earth. Iron is indeed a very great Alkaly, absorbs and corrects all Acids, as we have prov'd to a Demon∣stration in this Tract.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Page</HI> 40, 41.</NOTE> It is from the Sulphur or Brimstone which he discovers in those Waters, that an Acidity or Sourness is thought to be deriv'd to these Waters, which still is only imagi∣nary, because the contrary Quality ap∣pears to be there.</P>
<P>I must own, That I formerly never so much as doubted Sulphur to be other than an Acid, having always heard so
<PB N="51" REF="65"/>much Talk of the very sharp Oil of Sulphur, and Gas of Sulphur, besides the very suffocating and acrimonious Vapour of Brimstone, when kindled or made to flame, might easily impose such a false Opinion upon the unwary; but Experiment will prove just the contrary, and we shall find it rather to belong to the Alkalies, and not to have the least Shew or Footstep of an Acid in it: No, not to have so much of the Acid in it, as the pleasant and sweetest Wine of <HI>Italy,</HI> or the <HI>Canaries</HI> contain in them; for these, when boiled with Milk, make a strong Curd, which Sulphur will not do.</P>
<P>The Experiment. We took a Dram of Flowers of Brimstone, and a quar∣ter of a Pint of Milk, and boiled them together, they did not in the least cur∣dle the Milk, but made it tast more soft and balsamick than it did before. If you tast Sulphur, it lies soft upon the Tongue, does not give the least sub∣acid Relish; on the contrary, from hence are our healing and pectoral Balsams made, and many cutaneous and itching Distempers of the Skin, where the Hu∣mours do tare and lacerate the superfi∣cial
<PB N="52" REF="66"/>Parts, Sulphur is made Use of as a vulnerary, and cures beyond most other Applications. It is true it has a strong offensive Smell, but not the least of an acid Smell, Tast, or Quality, un∣less you reduce it to Flame; and then it is no longer Sulphur, but what proceeds from it is actually a Creature of the Fire. Let me give one common In∣stance, to shew the Difference between a Substance in its natural State, and when brought to an actual Flame, <HI>viz.</HI> good Oil of Olives may be swallow'd for a healing, pleasant, inward Medi∣cine, and is outwardly apply'd to ease an Inflammation or heal a Sore; in like manner the Tallow of a Candle may be apply'd to a sore Part, but if you touch the Flame of either of these, you will be made sensible, that they have lost all their Properties, and that what was a vulnerary, is become now of a corrosive and devouring Nature.</P>
<P>I perceive, that this sedulous Author has by strong Fires distilled some acid Spirits out of great Quantities of the Se∣diment of the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, which may well be obtain'd from those Salts and Sulphurs, he says, are contain'd in them; but whatever they are, I do po∣sitively
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>assert these acid Spirits to be Creatures of the Fire, and not to have been originally in the Water; Thus Oil of Vitriol (which our Author truly as∣serts to be the same with Oil of Sul∣phur) is only Fire wrapt up, or incorpo∣rated in a little moist Vehicle, will burn your Flesh, raise Blisters, heat Water, and give many other Proofs of its fiery Nature; which it may well do, having been perhaps 24 Hours a constant igni∣ted Body of Fire.</P>
<P>Having prov'd Sulphur to be an Al∣kaly, this will furnish our Author with one Argument more, and a very strong one, to establish the Opinion, that our Chalybeat Waters are Alkalies, not <HI>Aci∣dulae;</HI> for what Refuge can the Acidist fly to in order to the supporting the No∣tion of these Waters being an <HI>Acidula,</HI> or a sour Brunn; since even Brimstone it self (contain'd in these Waters, and judg'd an unquestionable Acid) proves to be the Reverse, or just contrary?</P>
<P>I must acknowledge my self very much indebted to him for this following Experiment, which alone would suffice to put a finishing, decisive Stroak to all this Controversy: In Page 109. he says, <HI>That these Waters do make a pretty strong
<PB N="54" REF="68"/>Effervescence with all Sorts of Sours, as with Vinegar, Wine, Spirit of Nitre, of Salt, of Vitriol:</HI> This Experiment outdoes all I ever met with, for none of our Waters (though some of them seem full of Iron) do in the least pretend to such an Alkaly, as in the least to ferment with Acids. But if this should fail, as I can scarce think it will, because it is so positively asserted, that when fresh taken up at the Fountain Head it does ferment; yet the following Experiment exhibits as certain, tho' not so sudden a Demon∣stration. He makes Use of Milk, and boils it with his Waters, and declares, that they will not curdle, but rather that they do preserve the Milk from coagu∣lating: See Page 148, 248. of this Au∣thor. He makes the same Experiment and Observation with mine Printed in the Transaction above 3 Years since, and since reprinted here.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 41.</NOTE> And infers as we do, that this is a strong Argument of the Alkalies contained in these Wa∣ters.</P>
<P>Our Author takes Notice of a Quan∣tity of Salt he finds in these Waters,
<PB N="55" REF="69"/>at the utmost 14 Grains in a Quart, to which he would ascribe the same purg∣ing Vertue; that our purging Salts have; but having had a Desire to satisfy my self in this Matter, I caused a very in∣genious Chymist to make an accurate Examen of these Waters new brought over, and he obtained about Ten Grains of Salt which one Quart afforded; this Salt consisted of a considerable Pro∣portion of Sea-Salt mixt with a bitter Salt; but had the Water held ten times the Quantity of that Compound Salt, it could not have caused one Purge, especially since these Waters are in them∣selves restringent, and guarded with stiptick Ingredients.</P>
<P>Now we are giving due Praises to the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, we may also ex∣pect that Justice be done to our <HI>English</HI> purging Salts, which are deservedly in∣troduc'd and receiv'd in our <HI>Materia Medica:</HI> This Author wrong represents them as a Chymical Composition of some Alkaly or other, join'd with an Acid: To my certain Knowledge many Centners of Pounds have been made out of our Purging Waters; but now indeed they have found out another Sort of a <HI>Minera,</HI> which produces this very
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>particular Salt, and is of the very same Figure, Tast, and Operation; but after this Way it can be made at less Expence, which still contributes more Good to Mankind. There is no more Art us'd in making this admirable Salt, than in making our common Sea Salt, there is nothing added to it, only other Mix∣tures are separated from it. Our Sea Salt may more pertinently be styled an Artificial Chymical Composition than this purging Salt, because there are more Things added to make that Gra∣nulat than are requir'd for this, tho' they are both hewn from off the same Rock, or dug out of the same Mine. I do not think it the worst Action of my Life for having been an early Instru∣ment in preparing and bringing this purging Salt into Practice; having made and used it before Doctor <HI>Grew,</HI> that ex∣cellent Physician, publish'd it to the World: It was once at 20 <HI>s.</HI> the Pound, he brought it to 8 <HI>s.</HI> I rejoice to see it, for the good of the Poor, at 12 <HI>d.</HI> the Pound: So that now they may have 16 Purges for one Shilling.</P>
<P>I have remarked above, that of late our Practice condemns the giving large Quantities of our ferruginous Waters. Our
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>Author here goes on somewhat fast in advancing so high as to direct Three Quarts of Water to be given to the Drinker the Third Day, but he makes a Stand at Four Quarts: I know it is a hard Matter, where the Practice of Drinking great Quantities has been con∣tinued so long, not to be born down with the Torrent of ancient Custom; but yet I must say in his Commendation, that though he be yet a young Man, he sees the Error, and will doubtless shake off the Prejudice of Custom and Education: For in Page 203. he con∣fesses, that it were safer and better to drink the Waters more moderately, and, as he says, <HI>not to offer Violence to Nature,</HI> but to allow more Time for a Cure.</P>
<P>This very Method would prevent another Inconvenience of Purging so much as they do; for if they did not o∣vercharge the Drinker with such Abun∣dance of Water, there would general∣ly speaking) be no need of Catharticks to discharge that Burden.</P>
<P>Both later and former Drinkers of the mention'd Waters at <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mont,</HI> have related to me, that they were advis'd by the Learned, and compell'd by the Example of most Drinkers, to use much
<PB N="58" REF="72"/>Motion to make their Waters pass the better; but surely in the Heat of Sum∣mer it must necessarily make them sweat, and hinder the right Evacuation by Urine. This is censur'd above, and I am pleas'd to find this Physician pru∣dently recommend a less violent Mo∣tion to his Patient, such as shall create no Sweat; I am in good Hopes, that the discreet Conduct of so worthy a Person, will correct and cure some of those Errors, which Length of Time has fix'd and rooted; and that he will make these Waters still more beneficial to those that drink them there.</P>
<P>I will conclude with a Quotation he has furnish'd me with, from Professo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Hoffman</HI>'s <HI>Dissertation:</HI> Upon whose Te∣stimony I set a great Value, because he is a most excellent and consummate Physician, and a curious Chymist: He says, <HI>Optimi qui virtute omnes, nostro qui∣dem judicio, antecellunt, sunt fontes Pyr∣montani.</HI> And farther: That upon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Examen he had made of many Waters <HI>the</HI> Pyrmont <HI>excell'd all in the Subtilt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Plenty of Spirits.</HI> I have now ob∣tain'd a Parcel of these Waters, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are come to my Hands, and are ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good, and do answer the Character given of them.</P>

<HEAD>A short Examen of a Treatise of Iron Waters, but especially of <HI>Ipswich Spa;</HI> Dedicated to the College of Physicians, <HI>1717.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE unknown, or conceal'd Au∣thor, will doubtless be found out at <HI>Ipswich,</HI> especially at this Fountain Head, with a vast Train of Patients daily crouding about these All-healing Waters; to which he ascribes such super∣lative Vertues, as far exceed all other Waters, but especially <HI>German Spa</HI> Wa∣ters: We are very severely chid and censur'd for our <HI>great Vanity and Folly in buying, and Cheats in selling these</HI> Waters; and that we may be sure not to overlook this Censure, it is put in the Title Page of this Book.</P>
<P>The Characters or Encomiums he gives, or attributes to these new-found Waters, are very great. That they do excel other Waters, in their pleasant and brisk, or spirituous Tast, in the Proper∣ty of keeping many Months without Loss of Strength, in their Volatility, and doing great Cures, and in many other super-excellent Qualities he assigns them,
<PB N="60" REF="74"/>sufficient to make any credulous Per∣son forthwith to take the Flying Coach, and to hasten to this Well, to consult the Doctor, which he directs, p. 28. to be very necessary.</P>
<P>For my Part, I am perswaded that he would soon have Numbers of Pa∣trons and Advocates, to join with him in extolling and recommending his Waters, provided they could be assured of the Truth of their assumed Vertue. Nor would he have Cause to be jealous of the Faculty it self, of being such Fools and Asses as he seems to describe them, pag. 82. <HI>Stiff Zealots, adhering to their own Opinions, like Asses being once led to Water; will drink at the same Place if possible.</HI></P>
<P>There are several hard Censures de∣nounced somewhat hastily, if not un∣mannerly too; he might have waited some Months, and have seen whether the World would not have been pro∣selyted by fair Means, good Words or his strong Arguments, which, he says, he has laid down to Demonstrati∣on, before he used such a satyrical and harsh Method. Nor do I think thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Anonymous</HI> Author to be ignorant tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="61" REF="75"/>we live in an inquisitive Age, and that the Faculty will not admit into their Materials of Physick such new Medicines, of which they have no Ex∣perience. Wherefore the Author must expect some Queries, or Remarks, or Postulata, will be propos'd: I ask leave only for some very few, having no Room for many.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1. Let me candidly expostulate with our Author, whether be has taken the best Way to convince us of the pre∣tended Excellency of his Waters, by depreciating others, and so dogmati∣cally asserting the Value of his own? Why did he not send a Hamper of his Waters to the President and Electors of the College, and that in Time, be∣fore his Book had been delivered to them. This was easy for him to do, because his Waters may be dip'd in the Morning, and be delivered at <HI>London</HI> in the Even; This was done by me be∣fore I presumed to give my Account of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmont</HI> Water; I obtained the Ap∣probation of the Two famous Societies, having brought a Quantity of these Waters for them to tast, and to exa∣mine by other Experiments: This Wa∣ter is oft kept back by contrary Winds,
<PB N="62" REF="76"/>and so came not to my Hands before it had been dip'd at least Two Months, and at least 8 Months before either of the Societies had it presented to them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. Does he think, That an up∣start <HI>Spring of Water, which he says,</HI> pag. 126. <HI>is lately discovered at</HI> Ipswich, <HI>and that has but six Weeks obtained its full Perfection,</HI> should so suddenly gain such Authority and Power, as to prohibit or proscribe the Use of those celebrated <HI>German</HI> Waters, which Physicians of the preceding, as well as the present Age, have successfully prescribed to their Pa∣tients?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 3. Is it not more likely that he aims at his own Interest more than at the Good of Mankind? What is the Meaning of his taking Care to have an <HI>Arcanum</HI> of his to be also mixt with these Waters, he gives it the Name of <HI>Tinctura Basilica;</HI> which it seems is sold up and down the Town of <HI>Ipswich</HI> as <HI>Daphy's</HI> Elixir, or <HI>Stoughton's</HI> Drops? Altogether considered, it, makes one shrewdly suspect, that the Doctor and Proprietor have a great Regard to self and by-Ends: when convinced of the contrary, I shall soon retract.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="77"/>
<P>In the Title Page we are told, that he has made <HI>several curious Experiments and nice Observations, such as were never before made.</HI> Give me leave to challenge 2 or 3 of these nice Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. He endeavours to prove an Acidity in these Waters, and is led into the old <HI>German</HI> Error of the <HI>Acidulae.</HI> In Page 121. he says, <HI>Having taken about a quar∣ter of a Pint of Milk, and caused it to be heated, I poured into it whilst it was warm about four Spoonfuls of the</HI> Ipswich Spa, <HI>and it immediately turn'd it to Curds, as if Beer, or some mild Acid had been poured in.</HI> For my Part, I should much less esteem his Water, if it were so as he says, that it would turn Milk, and prov∣ed it self an Acid; for Acids cause ma∣ny Diseases, and we fly to Alkalies for the Cure. But I stand amazed at this Assertion of his, when I am morally certain of the contrary, and that there is no Chalybeat Water in <HI>England</HI> that is Acid, or produces this Effect on Milk.</P>
<P>But to give my self more Satisfaction, I procured some Bottles from the <HI>Ips∣wich</HI> Fountain, which came to my Hands full, well cork'd, and carefully seal'd. I made the Experiment as above di∣rected, but could not make any Curd
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>to rise: I made farther Experiments in Favour of the Water, I doubled and trebled the Quantity of the Water, to see if by any Means I could curdle the Milk, but nothing succeeded: Have a Care that you use new Milk, and do not mistake a few Creamy, or Oily Par∣ticks, that will stick to the Side of any Glass, and call that Curd. Interest and Prejudice can discover what they have a Mind to.</P>
<P N="2">2. He runs much upon a volatile Acid, as if it were one of the grand Principles of his own, and even all mar∣tial Waters. See Page 52. and in many other Places. Is it not strange, that the Promiser of such curious Experi∣ments in the Title Page, should not put it upon this most natural and easy Ex∣periment in the World, which a very ordinary Chymist may perform? Why did he not (since he lives near the Spring) put a Quart or two of this Water into a Glass Limbec, (called Head and Body) or any other Still, and by a very gentle Fire receive the Liquor that came over, and so tast and try it whether it held any Acidity or no? Does not this Omission put a Man justly upon the Question, whether
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>this Author has really a Mind to find out Truth or no? For my Part, I can tell him the Fate of this Experi∣ment, that he will certainly distil over an insipid Water, even from the first to the last Drop in the Still, because I have tried many such Waters as his this way, and none of them ever gave the least Drop of an Acid.</P>
<P N="3">3. He also asserts, and takes it for granted, that the fixt Salts that remain after Evaporation are Acid. It is strange that this must also be suppposed, and not tried. I found in his Waters, which is the Condition of most of our <HI>English</HI> Chalybeat Waters, that they contain very little Salt. Out of his <HI>Ipswich</HI> Wa∣ter I could only get Two Grains from a Pint; I tried it with Milk, but it would not curdle half a Spoonful of Milk after several Days standing in a Window: I gained Five Grains out of a Pint of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, (which Waters do hold more Salt than any o∣ther of the true Chalybeat Waters. I have seen or heard of) I put these Grains to one Spoonful of Milk, which did keep the Milk, from curdling full Seven Days in <HI>September.</HI></P>
<PB N="66" REF="80"/>
<P N="4">4. He says he has experimented this, that his Waters have not only 14 Days, but as many Weeks, kept their intire Vertue. I wish he had try'd them whether they would carry to <HI>London,</HI> as far as the College of Physicians, be∣cause those which I sent for did not carry Four Days, so as to hold their Vertue; and truly by the course <HI>Ocra</HI> I found at the Bottom, they seem to me to resemble <HI>Islington</HI> Waters, which will lose their Vertue in 24 Hours.</P>
<P>What I have said in the high Praise of the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, being a Foreign <HI>German</HI> Water, must certainly expose me to the Displeasure of this Author; especially since I have also in some low∣er Degree justified the Vertue of the <HI>Spa,</HI> when brought to us in a good Condition; and this I must acknow∣ledge, that this last Year they have been brought us better than formerly; tho' I am sure it is not in their Nature to preserve their Vertue as the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> will do.</P>
<P>Now I conclude with my hearty Wishes, that this Endeavour of mine to serve my Neighbour may have some good Effect. I can assure the Reader,
<PB N="67" REF="81"/>that a sincere Love of Truth, divested of all Manner of private Interest, has been the only Motive of this Under∣taking.</P>
<P>I pretend not to Infallibility, some Errors and Mistakes, and some unjust Censures will attend every Writer; he that candidly convinces me of the former, shall always have the Thanks of</P>
