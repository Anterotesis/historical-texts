<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH publishers of receipts have been always very numerous, yet it has so happened, that the least able have hitherto undertaken this task, as the most easy and likely to answer any merce∣nary views; which seems to have been the reason, that more able persons have neglected it as an under part of their profession. Ne∣vertheless, I have persuaded myself, that I should perform a work, neither entirely void, of use, nor foreign to the duties of my pro∣fession, if I made the public partakers of the principal helps against most diseases, which I had either learned by long experience, or selected from the writings of the most emi∣nent physicians. As these receipts are pub∣lished chiefly for the use of persons residing in the country, whose convenience or abilities, will not allow of the attendance of a physician or apothecary, I have studied plainness in my stile, and in my directions, with regard to the treatment of diseases, that I might render this treatise as useful as possible.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception this work has met with, as is sufficiently shewn by the remarkable quick sale of the first large impression, has induced the editor (to support the credit of what is really bene∣ficial to the public, and add weight to the receipts) to publish the authorities from whence those receipts were taken; and to make it still more useful, has added the signs of diseases, and some plain and concise direc∣tions for bleeding: he begs leave to remark, that although Dr. Theobald has given no more than one receipt for the cure of several disorders, yet he has been careful to select such, <HI>only,</HI> as upon a long experience were found to be the best; and that although re∣ceipts are given for diseases which are seldom cured, (as the apoplexy, consumption, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) yet if it is in the power of medicine to remove any of these complaints, there is the greatest reason to imagine, that the remedies directed in this pamphlet will effect a cure.</P>

<HEAD>AGUE, or INTERMITTING FEVER, <HI>Signs of.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A violent head-ach, a weariness of the limbs, a pain in the loins, a coldness of the external parts, a shivering and shaking, sometimes so much as to make the very bed shake under them; a great thirst and burning heat, and frequent inclination to vomit. Afterwards the symptoms begin to abate, the skin becomes moist, the urine is of a flame co∣lour, but without a sediment, and a sweat break∣ing out terminates the fit.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST vomit the sick person, by giving half a drachm of the powder of Ipecacoanha, and work it off with Chamomile tea; then let the sick person take the following powder:</P>
<P>Of the best Peruvian bark powdered, one ounce, of Virginia Snake root, and salt of Wormwood, each one drachm; mix these well together, and divide them into eight doses, one paper to be taken every two hours in a glass of red wine or any other liquid. This is a certain and infallible cure; but care must be taken to administer it only in the intervals of the fits; but it must be re∣peated for two or three days, about ten days after the first cure, or else the disorder will frequently return. In obstinate cases, removing into a drier air has been found of great service.</P>

<HEAD>SAINT ATHONY's FIRE. <HI>Signs of.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This disease affects every part of the body, but most frequently the face, and it happens at all times of the year. But whatever part is affected,
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>a chilliness and shivering generally attend the dis∣order, with great thirst, restlessness, and other signs of a fever; the face swells of a sudden, with great pain and redness, and abundance of small pimples appear, which often rise up into small blisters, and spread over the forehead and head, the eyes being quite closed by the largeness of the swelling. This, in the country, is usually called a Blast.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>LET the sick, person loose eight or ten ounces of blood, and repeat the bleeding more than once if the symptoms run high, and apply to the part a pultice of white bread and milk, with a little Hogs Lard in it; let the pultice be changed twice in a day, and every other morning take the following purge, till the disorder is cured, viz.</P>
<P>Glauber's salt one ounce, Manna half an ounce, mix and dissolve it in warm water for one dose.</P>
<P>The diet in this disease must be very low, chiefly Water Gruel, or at most weak broth; all strong liquors must be avoided as poison.</P>

<P>Tremblings, staggering, a giddiness in the head, dimness of sight, sleepiness, loss of memory, noise in the ears, and deep and laborious breathing. The disease itself is a total deprivation of sense and mo∣tion, except that of respiration, which is performed with difficulty, and snoring. It usually ends in a paralytic disorder, and is seldom curable, but al∣ways leaves behind it a great defect of memory, judgment and motion.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>CUPPING in the nape and sides of the neck is always useful, provided the scarifications are
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>deep enough to give a free passage to the blood; stimulating clysters and warm purges are also of service, as is also the following electuary: Take half an ounce of powdered Heath Valerian, and one ounce and an half of conserve of Orange peel, and mix them together; the dose is the quantity of a nutmeg every four hours, dissolved in a cup∣ful of Rosemary tea. Apply a strong blister to the back, the diet must be very sparing.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="12"/>times in a day. Bleeding is generally proper, as is a large blister applied to the back, and gentle vomits; the diet should be slender. Malt liquors must be avoided, being very pernicious.</P>

In short, it must at first be treated as a small fever, with gentle Diaphoretics, such as half a drachm of the compound powder of Con∣trayerva, taken night and morning, or half an ounce of Mindererus's spirit, may be given every night going to rest, drinking a plentiful draught
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>of weak Sack Whey after it. If any cough should remain, after using this method a few days, the medicines directed under the article of <HI>Coughs,</HI> must be taken,</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS concerning BLEEDING.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Bleeding has been directed in many disorders in the course of this work; yet as the improper use of it is attended frequently with the most fatal consequences, it has been judged necessary to bring into one point of view all those cases in which bleeding may be administ∣ered with advantage, as well as those in which it is highly prejudical. In all inflammatory diseases, it should by no means be omitted, as in the Pleu∣risy, and Peripneumony, during the first days; but so soon as the symptoms of suppuration ap∣pear expectorating medicines are the most proper means from which to expect relief, and the use of the lancet must be totally forbid. In the Apo∣plexy, Epilepsy, Bloody-flux and Inflammation of the bowels, bleeding must be repeated accord∣ing to the exigence of the symptoms: it is also useful, sometimes to promote suppuration in large abscesses, where nature is too much opprest by the violence of the inflammation. In Inflamma∣tions of the Eyes, Bladder, or Womb, Ischiatic pains, Rheumatisms, Coughs, Head-achs, Quin∣seys, Asthmas, Hemorrhages, and Nephritic complaints, Bleeding is of the utmost service: but in every disorder proceeding from a relaxed state of the vessels, and impoverished state of the Blood, attended with a cachectic habit of body, such as Dropsies, Jaundice, Gout, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> bleeding must be abstained from with the utmost caution, as it will, instead of relieving, greatly aggravate those distempers.</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. Stephens's famous cure for the STONE and GRAVEL, as amended by Dr. Hartley.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE two scruples of calcined Egg-shells, three times in a day, in a glass of any convenient liquor, drinking after each dose, a third part of the following decoction: Take two ounces of Castile soap, dissolve it in a quart of soft water, and sweeten it according to your taste, with Honey or Loaf sugar. If this decoction is made in a cop∣per vessel, care must be taken that it is well tinn'd. The taking of these medicines must be continued for some time after the complaint ceases, lest any part of the Stone should remain, which being rough and unequal might occasion exquisite pain. It is common after a few days use of these medicines, to have an increase of pain in making water, at which time, a soft diet, emollient drinks, and rest, are proper. For common drink, milk and water, or a decoction of Marshmallow roots, Parsley and Liquorice may be used; but if the person has been used to strong liquors, small punch made without acid may be drank sparingly. Artichoaks, asparagus, spinnage, lettuces, succory, parsley, turnips, carrots, potatoes, radishes, peas, &amp;c. may be safely used, but onions, leeks and cellery, are to be preferred to all other vegetables.</P>
<P>The patient ought to drink no more of any li∣quor than is sufficient to quench his thirst, and he should hold his water, as long as he can without great uneasiness, that it may have the longer time to act on the stone. If these medicines occasion costiveness, it will be necessary now and then, at discretion, to take a dose of Glauber's salt and Manna.</P>
