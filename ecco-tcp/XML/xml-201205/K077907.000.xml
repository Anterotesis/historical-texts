<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have heard, that the Watch-Word in the Time of War, is frequent∣ly the Name of One of the Generals; and that he who
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>makes use of it, (upon be∣ing Demanded, <HI>Who Goes there?</HI>) is allow'd, without further Questions, to pass on about his Business.</P>
<P>This engag'd me to ask the Liberty of Prefixing your Name to this Trifle; which however unworthy it may be of the Honour, will yet derive a double Advan∣tage from it; first to Itself, then to it's Author: It will Itself, by this Means, pass un∣question'd into the World; and it's Author will have an Opportunity of paying due Acknowledgments, for the
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>Benefits he has receiv'd from your Industry and Ingenu∣ity. The Success which has so frequently attended the Use of your Needle in this Delicate Operation, suffici∣ently shews the Niceness of your Hand; and the little Damage you have ever done, where Unavoidable Acci∣dents have conspir'd to ren∣der the Operation unsucces∣ful, is a great Evidence of the Accuracy of your Judg∣ment.</P>
<P>The Knowledge I have of this Branch of my Professi∣on, such as it is, I am wholy
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>indebted to You for; and the Success I have had on a Great Number of Subjects within these two Years, will I hope prove that I have fol∣low'd no ill Director.</P>
<P>If I have in any Degree made it probable, that the Opacity of the Crystalline Humor is the True CATA∣RACT, I must here own that I had the First Hint of it from You: And if I have done no Injustice to your Opinion by unworthily de∣fending it, I hope shortly to see some One of my Bre∣thren, more able than Myself,
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>take this Method of gi∣ving You publick Thanks for the Discovery.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Think it Necessary for my own Vindication to say Something by Way of Preface, and I expect to be pardon'd for it by all Honest Impartial Men; for 'tis to such only I appeal, having already suffer'd as much as I could suffer, from Men of a Character quite contrary.</P>
<P>I am sorry I have it to say, That the worst Usage I have met with, has
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>been from the Gentlemen of my own Profession; and that this Trifle of mine whilst an <HI>Embryo,</HI> has been suf∣ficiently ridicul'd by them: 'Tis, perhaps, still shapeless and unform'd; but if there are found in it the Fea∣tures of a Man, 'twill at least demand some Regard from all those who would deserve the Character of Men. I have been driven to such a <HI>Dilem∣ma</HI> by their Unnatural Treatment, that for some Time I have suspen∣ded the Publication, and was once resolv'd intirely to suppress it. This following has been their Way of Ar∣guing, <HI>If 'tis his Own, 'twill not bear the Light; if 'twill bear the Light, 'tis not his Own;</HI> either Side of this would be equally prejudicial to me: But I shall endeavour to prove, that if I have not made a very ill Use of
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>my Time and Advantages, it may bear the Light, and yet be my Own.</P>
<P>When I have done this in the best Manner I am capable, I shall desire this following Fair Challenge may be annex'd to my Account of Myself: That if any of my <HI>Ʋnkind Brethren</HI> have any Thing to say, which They think will prove me too ignorant for my Profession, that they may do it in the same publick Manner which I have made Use of to prove that I am not so.</P>
<P>The Worthy Gentleman to whom I have made an Offer of this Trifle in the <HI>Dedication,</HI> will be my Wit∣ness of rhe Truth of the following Particulars: That I attended the Pra∣ctice of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Hospital regu∣larly
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>and diligently the Time I was a PUPIL there, and that it was fur∣nish'd at that Time with a Sett of the Best and most Rational Practitioners which have been ever known there.</P>
<P>I think according to the Account of the Hospital, that there are very seldom less than 4 or 5000 Subjects cured of their several Diseases in a Year; and I believe it will very rea∣dily be granted by all unprejudic'd People, that where Accidents are so various and numerous, a young Sur∣geon may improve himself more in five or six Months, than he can with the best private Master in the King∣dom in as many Years: Here more∣over a Man has the Opportunity of learning every Branch of his Profes∣sion; and he who does not endea∣vour
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>to practise it afterwards, as it comes in his Way, ought (I think) to be suspected of great Negligence in his Observation, or Want of Abi∣lity to see into the Reason of the Pra∣ctice; either of which will certainly make him fearful of undertaking it, because the Success will always ap∣pear doubtful to him: But when a Man has by diligent Observation on the Chirurgical Part, and a compe∣tent Knowledge of the Rational, qua∣lify'd himself to discharge the Duty of his Profession with Ability and Honesty, I think his endeavouring to do so, should not only not ren∣der him obnoxious to the Gentle∣men of his Profession, but even make him claim some Share of their Re∣gard, and Protection too from the Insults of the rest of the World:
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>But to come nearer to the Point, and the Occasion of this <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P>When I came to practise in this City, full of Expectation of the U∣sage just now mention'd, I soon found myself miserably deceiv'd; for instead of That, I was immediately surrounded with <HI>Calumny</HI> and <HI>Detra∣ction:</HI> And from what Quarter? Why even from those Gentlemen by whom I thought to be <HI>Protected:</HI> There was immediately a <HI>Party</HI> rai∣sed against me, who not contented with aspersing my Abilities, fell foul upon my Manners; and would fain have insinuated, (if they could have got any Man of Sense to have be∣liev'd them) that if a Man wore to∣lerable good Cloaths, and lik'd the Company of a Friend, 'twas impos∣sible
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>he could be a good Surgeon: These are a Sett of worthy People, who are themselves</P>
<Q><L>— Dully grave, insipidly serene,</L>
<L>And carry all their Wisdom in their Mien.</L></Q>
<P>And in short, they like Nobody, but such as are like themselves: So that an Awkard <HI>Saint-like</HI> Behaviour, a <HI>Solemn</HI> Gait, an <HI>Hypocritial</HI> Eleva∣tion of the Eye, and an <HI>Affected Religious</HI> Grimace, is sufficient with them to set a Man at the Head of his Profession. If a Man is recom∣mended to any of them, the First Question is, <HI>Is he One of Ʋs?</HI> If they are answer'd in the Negative, they immediately fly; and tho' they know Nothing of the Man, swear he has no Faith, no Honour, no Ca∣pacity,
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>no Money, nor any Thing else which can render a Man quali∣fy'd to be employ'd in any Thing.</P>
<P>'Tis a great Hardship to fall into the Hands of these Gentlemen, and yet to be quite void of all those va∣luable Talents which must recom∣mend one to their Favour. For my Part, if I am call'd to a Patient, I expect my Business is with his <HI>Body,</HI> and not with his <HI>Soul:</HI> I can <HI>Set</HI> a Broken Leg, as well as my Neigh∣bours; but as to <HI>Cases of Conscience,</HI> I must leave them to be set right by Gentlemen whose Profession qualifies and authorizes them to do it.</P>
<P>But I am afraid, if we come to ex∣amin the Matter a little more close∣ly, we shall find that this is generally
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>all Stratagem; and that my <HI>Worthy</HI> Brethren who make use of it, have an odd Way of imposing upon the World, and giving of it one Term for another: Their pretended <HI>Gravity</HI> should be call'd <HI>Natural Dulness,</HI> for 'tis so in Fact; and where there is Fire, it will shew itself: Their Pre∣tence to <HI>Religion,</HI> in Opposition to <HI>Human Reason,</HI> is not because they have <HI>more</HI> of the First than their Neighbours, but <HI>less</HI> of the Latter: Their <HI>Canting</HI> Custom of Asking a peculiar Blessing on every Thing they undertake, is because they know their Skill will stand very much in Need of it: Their Disaffection to Human Learning is, because they know Nothing more of it than the Name; and so of every Thing else;
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>In short, I am tir'd of them; but I'll beg Leave to say, they are very pret∣ty People to trust Mens Lives and Limbs with.</P>
<P>I have often wonder'd, that when the ACT was made for Examining all Surgeons (before they were ad∣mitted to practise in and about <HI>Lon∣don</HI>) at <HI>Surgeons-Hall,</HI> the same Or∣der did not pass thro' every County, that the Country might have had the same Advantage of having a Sett of Able Men amongst them as the Town has: Many and great would have been the Benefits of it, to the Profession in General, to every Able Professor of it in Particular, and to all those whose Misfortunes oblige them to have Recourse to It or Them for Assi∣stance.
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>Every Apprentice would be oblig'd to be diligently attentive in his Business, in order to qualifie him∣self to pass his Examination; and this certainly in Time would be of infinite Advantage to the Profession: Every Able Professor of it would certainly be known, by that very Examination, to be so; and by this Means would be plac'd in his pro∣per Sphere, and fear no Danger from the <HI>Canting Blockheads</HI> beneath him. The Benefit of the Patient, is too ob∣vious to be insisted upon; his Limbs very frequently, and often his Life too would be preserv'd by it.</P>
<P>But as a <HI>Capacity</HI> is not Every Thing which is requir'd of a Surgeon, I wish there was any Method as certain as
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>this, to try their <HI>Honesty:</HI> Some I have known who have wanted Both, others who have had the First and wanted the Latter; but in order to make a Good Surgeon, 'tis absolutely necessary that a Man should want Neither of them. I'll beg the Liberty to relate a Story or Two of a Gen∣tleman who has been remarkably kind to me, and I am very glad I have this Opportunity of returning his Civility, and letting the World know that he is a Man of <HI>Real Me∣rit:</HI> This Friend of mine was sent for to a Child that had dislocated its Knee, he carried with him Plaisters, Bandage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in order to reduce it, which he endeavour'd to do in the best Manner his Capacity would ad∣mit of; after the Business was over,
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>he encourag'd the Friends by promi∣sing the greatest Success: Next Day he call'd to see his little Patient, and found the Family much pleas'd at his <HI>great</HI> Skill, declaring that the Child's Complaint in that Part was intirely remov'd: The Doctor finding in this Case that he had not spent his Skill in vain, began to exert himself upon it, and undertook a Case of much more Difficulty, (which prov'd a <HI>Dis∣location</HI> in Fact) in which he assured them of the like Success, and that he would cure that as expeditiously as he did the other; which, to prove his Assertions true, he actually did; by which <HI>wonderful</HI> Cure he has demon∣strated his <HI>Genius</HI> in a <HI>laudable</HI> Man∣ner. Another Brother of mine (some small Distance from this Place) had the Care of a Gentlewoman, whom
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>he kept in Torment several Years, and left her at last as Bad or Worse than he found her; she applied her∣self to a Surgeon of my Acquain∣tance, who made a perfect Cure of her in Fourteen Days: This <HI>Won∣derful</HI> Man was ask'd some Time af∣ter, How it came about that a Man of his <HI>pretended</HI> Abilities and long Practice, after a Trial of Years, should miss of Success in a Case where a Young Fellow just beginning to pra∣ctise, succeeded to the Surprize of the whole Town in a few Days? And whether he did not think it ought to diminish his Character, and add to the Character of the other? He had a Conflict with himself for some Time whether he should sa∣crifice his <HI>Capacity</HI> or <HI>Honesty;</HI> at last it went on the Side of <HI>Dear Ca∣pacity,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>and answer'd, <HI>She had Mo∣ney!</HI> But I shall leave him as I found him; and hasten to tell you the Rea∣son of my publishing the following Account of a CATARACT.</P>
<P>I am more sensible than any other Man can be, of my own Inability to perform accurately what I have propos'd in my <HI>Title-Page;</HI> my De∣sign not being at all to instruct those whose regular Education in Physick and Mathematicks have qualify'd them to understand these Things infinite∣ly better than I can pretend to do: And I declare before I enter upon the Work, that I have no other View in it than to satisfie the World that I am no <HI>Emprick</HI> (as I have been vilely and maliciously represented to
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>be) in my Profession of COUCH∣ING; but that I know as much of the Nature and Structure of the EYE, as is requir'd of any one who pre∣tends to the Operation.</P>
<P>The Reason why this nice and ne∣cessary Operation is so rarely perfor∣med by Gentlemen regularly bred to the Profession of Surgery, I take to be this; That it having been a long Time the distinguishing Excellency of seve∣ral of our famous Mountebanks, the regular Surgeons, by undertaking it, are under the dreadful Apprehensi∣ons of being rank'd with itinerant Operators, commonly known by the Name of <HI>Quacks:</HI> The Fault is abso∣lutely their own; for did they not join with these <HI>Empiricks</HI> (whom up∣on
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>every other Account they suffici∣ently despise) to oppress every young Fellow who dares attempt a Thing which is not the general Profession of the whole Fraternity, whatever Pains he has taken, or whatever Ad∣vantages he has had to make himself Master of the Performance; did they not join to do this, I say, how ineffe∣ctual would all the little Malice and Calumny of these contemptible <HI>Wret∣ches</HI> be towards ruining the Reputa∣tion of a regular Surgeon! And how easie would it be for us, (for 'tis We only who can do it) by making a Collection of the injudicious and barbarous Practices of those illite∣rate murdering <HI>Raseals,</HI> so to destroy their Reputations, (if 'tis not a Scan∣dal to the Word <HI>Reputation</HI> to use
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>it in suck Company) that in a few Years we might be able to take this and some other Branches of our Pro∣fession Home to ourselves, the Ori∣ginal Proprietors, without any Man∣ner of Danger of the foregoing Im∣putation.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Mechanism of the EYE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I have propos'd to give some Account of the Me∣chanism of the EYE, I know no properer Way of beginning it, than by an Anatomical Disse∣ction of the EYE Itself; and after I have shewn some few general Diseases that the particu∣lar Coats and Humors of the Eye are sub∣ject to, I shall proceed to shew how the said Coats and Humors are instrumental to
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>Vision, and then by what particular Diseases the Eye is render'd Totally Opake: And there I shall endeavour to ascertain the true Place of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> and the Consequence of a <HI>judicious</HI> or <HI>injudicious</HI> Removal of It.</P>
<P>The Globe of the Eye is moved by Six Muscles, Four Streight, and Two Oblique, <HI>viz. Elevator; Depressor, Adductor, Abductor, Obliquus Superior,</HI> and <HI>Inferior:</HI> The First of these arises out of the Bottom of the <HI>Or∣bit,</HI> and after it has ascended and grown ten∣dinous, is inserted into the Upper Part of the <HI>Tunica Sclerotis,</HI> near the <HI>Cornea.</HI> The <HI>De∣pressor</HI> arises and is inserted directly opposite to the <HI>Elevator.</HI> The <HI>Adductor</HI> arises from the Bottom of the <HI>Orbit,</HI> and is inserted on the Side next the Nose, into the <HI>Tunica Scle∣rotis.</HI> The <HI>Abductor</HI> arises and is inserted directly opposite to the <HI>Adductor.</HI> The <HI>Su∣perior</HI> Oblique Muscle arises between the <HI>Elevator</HI> and <HI>Adductor,</HI> at the Bottom of the <HI>Orbit,</HI> thence ascending by the <HI>Sutura Trans∣versalis</HI> becomes a Round Tendon, which passes thro' a little Annular Cartilage call'd <HI>Trochlea,</HI> (from its bearing the Form of a Pully) at the upper and inner Part of the
<PB N="29" REF="27"/><HI>Orbit</HI> near its Edge, is inserted near the Bot∣tom of the Eye. The <HI>Inferior</HI> Oblique Mus∣cle arises from the <HI>Os Maxillae Superioris,</HI> thence passing over the <HI>Depressor,</HI> is inserted at the Bottom of the Eye near the <HI>Abductor.</HI> The Four Streight Muscles are so fix'd to the <HI>Sclerotis,</HI> that they lift up the Eye, de∣press it, bring it towards the Nose or from it, hold it fast, turn it round, just as they act either separately or conjointly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Superior</HI> Oblique Muscle moves the Eye round towards the Nose about its <HI>Axis,</HI> and pulls it upward and inward, and there∣by directs the Pupil outward and downward; and thus the Eye is dispos'd to see Things placed near it. The <HI>Inferior</HI> Oblique Mus∣cle turns the Eye towards the outward Cor∣ner, and also upwards; if these Two act together, they fix the Eye fierce and protu∣berant out of the <HI>Orbit:</HI> Moreover, ano∣ther Use of these Muscles is, to suspend the Eye, and render it very fit to perform the Motions of the other Four. Between these Muscles Fat is interspers'd, which serves to lubricate and facilitate their Motion.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
<P>Next we come to the <HI>Coats</HI> and <HI>Humors</HI> of the Eye: The first is the <HI>Tunica Adnata,</HI> or <HI>Conjunctiva;</HI> it makes that which is call'd the White of the Eye, and is full of Blood-Vessels; which are very visible in an <HI>Ophthalmia:</HI> The Symptoms of this Disease are Heat, Pain, Pulsation, and an apparent Distention of these Blood-Vessels; it may be occasion'd externally, by any Thing forc'd against or coming into the Eye, irritating or compressing the Fibres of this Coat. If this Inflammation be only external, the Case symptomatical, and the Patient not worne out by other Diseases, 'tis easily Curable: On the Contrary, if it becomes so great as to tumefie the Face, and the Humors very pungent and corrosive, we judge it difficult to cure. Its Cure depends on Bleeding, le∣nient Purgation, Blistring, Cupping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> toge∣ther with the Assistance of a cooling Diet, topical Application, and proper <HI>Collyria.</HI></P>
<P>The next Coat is the <HI>Sclerotis:</HI> It expandes itself nearly into a Globe, membranous and hard almost like Leather, and encompasses the whole Eye, growing gradually thinner, clearer, and prominent in the Fore-part,
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>which Part of it is call'd <HI>Cornea,</HI> from its Transparency; they make together one firm Coat, for the Use of the other Coats and Humors. This Coat is sometimes diseas'd by a little White Speck of a Cartilaginous Substance, covering Part of, and sometimes the whole <HI>Pupilla:</HI> If this Excrescence is only superficial, it may be remov'd by an O∣peration in Surgery call'd <HI>Leucotomy;</HI> but if the <HI>Cornea</HI> is throly affected, I believe it incurable. This Operation is perform'd in the following Manner, <HI>viz.</HI> I place the Pa∣tient in a proper Position, and fixing the <HI>Spe∣culum Oculi</HI> invented for that Purpose in or∣der to keep the Globe without Motion, pare off the Excrescence with a small curv'd Knife, leaving as few Inequalities as possible; and having prevented an Inflammation by proper Repellents, I blow a Powder into the Eye; which, assisted by the Motion of the Eye∣lid, smooths off the Inequalities left by the Knife.</P>
<P>Next to this Coat lies the <HI>Tunica Choroi∣des:</HI> 'Tis a Membrane of little Firmness, be∣ing much thinner than the former; 'tis ting'd by a dark Liquor separated from the Blood-Vessels,
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>so that it appears of a rusty dark Co∣lour; this Coat has a Perforation in it, call'd <HI>Pupilla:</HI> The Part of this Coat which makes the Circumference of this Hole, and which lies upon the Side of the Crystalline Hu∣mor, is call'd <HI>Uvea,</HI> compos'd of circular and streight Fibres; 'tis qualified by this Means to contract and dilate, as Light and Objects make different Impressions upon it. The Outside of this last Membrane is call'd <HI>Iris,</HI> where appear different Colours: On the Inside of it from its Circumference arise the <HI>Processus Ciliares,</HI> made of short Fibres like Lines drawn from the Circumference to the Center.</P>
<P>The last Coat is the <HI>Retina,</HI> so call'd from its Resemblance to a Net; it covers the whole Fund of the Eye, and is nothing more than a fine Expansion of the Medullary Fi∣bres of the Optick Nerve, upon which the Rays of Light meeting in a Point, convey the Images of outward Objects to the Brain. The Disease of this Coat is call'd <HI>Gutta Serena;</HI> the Eye seems clear in Appearance, and there are no other Signs of Blindness ex∣cept a preternatural Dilatation of the <HI>Pu∣pilla.</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>I shall have Occasion to speak more largely of this Disease by and by.</P>
<P>Between these Coats are contain'd Three Humors, the <HI>Aqueous,</HI> the <HI>Crystalline,</HI> and the <HI>Vitreous:</HI> The First is call'd <HI>Aqueous</HI> because it resembles Water, being a thin transparent Fluid; it serves to extend the <HI>Cornea</HI> into an equal Convexity; besides, it serves moreover for the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor to move forward or backward in, as Occasion requires us to see Objects nearer or farther from us.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Crystalline:</HI> It's compounded of numberless spherical Segments, closely u∣nited and transparent; its Shape is a deprest Spheriod, it's inclos'd in a fine Membrane call'd <HI>Aranea,</HI> and is much thicker than ei∣ther the <HI>Aqueous</HI> or <HI>Vitreous:</HI> Its Diseases and Uses I shall speak of in another Place.</P>
<P>The next is the <HI>Vitreous:</HI> It's very clear and tenacious, it lies behind the <HI>Crystalline,</HI> and fills the greatest Part of the Eye; it's vascular on every Side, its Foreside concave for the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor to lodge in, and
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>Backside convex; it keeps the <HI>Retina</HI> and <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor at a proper Distance: This Humor is sometimes so vitiated as to hinder or utterly destroy Sight, which Dis∣ease is often mistook for a <HI>Gutta Serena.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now proceed to speak of the Parts of the Eye, as they are subservient to Vision.</P>
<P>The Use of the Muscles in general is to direct the Globe of the Eye, and fix it in such a Position, as that the Rays of Light reflected from any Object which we would have visible to us, may pass thro' the <HI>Pupilla</HI> and paint the Image of it on the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>To form the Image of any Object, 'tis ne∣cessary that the Rays of Light coming from it should converge and meet in a <HI>Foous:</HI> And we judge of the comparative Magni∣tude of all Bodies, by the Angle which is subtended by those Bodies before the Eye.</P>
<P>To qualifie the Eye to perform this, Na∣ture has given it a spherical Form, and com∣pos'd it of transparent Goats and Humors; the latter to transmit the Rays coming from
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>the luminous Points of Objects, and the for∣mer to refract them in such a Degree as to bring them all together in a Point on the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>All convex diaphanous Bodies refract the Rays of Light by Attraction, and the Ray bends towards that Part or the Body where there is the greatest Quantity of Matter; this in convex Bodies is the Middle.</P>
<P>Therefore all Rays on whatever Parts of such Bodies they fall, are refracted to∣wards a Line drawn thro' the Center of those Bodies, and made to converge behind them at a Distance proportionable to the greater or less Convexity of the Bodies them∣selves: Thus when the Eye is too flat, as in old People, (from a Decay of the Humors, or a Shrinking of the Coats, or both) the converging Rays do not coalesce at the <HI>Re∣tina;</HI> but would pass on if suffer'd, and not come to a Point but at some Distance beyond it: By this Means Vision becomes weak and indistinct.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
<P>On the contrary, those call'd <HI>Myopes,</HI> or Near-sighted People, have their Eyes too gibbous, and the Convexity of them is so great, that the Rays meet and cross one a∣nother before they arrive at the <HI>Retina.</HI> The former Eyes are help'd by Convex-Glasses, which put the Rays into a State of easie Re∣fraction before they fall upon the Eye: The latter are help'd by Concave-Glasses, thro' which the Rays passing do diverge, and fall upon the Eye in such a Manner, as to re∣quire a greater Degree of Refraction than they would in their natural Course: In the former Case the Eye is not help'd by the Object's appearing bigger, but more distinct; for very small Objects are render'd distinctly visible to such an Eye by the Help of a Con∣vex-Glass, whereas very large ones cannot be seen enough to be distinguish'd by the Na∣ked Eye.</P>
<P>I don't propose to give any new Theory of Vision, nor to be able to describe the Man∣ner of it better than 'tis already done by an eminent Author; for which Reason I shall make use of his own Words, so far as they are serviceable to my present Purpose, and
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>conducive to the main End of this Treatise, which is to ascertain the True PLACE of a <HI>Cataract.</HI></P>
<P>All the Rays which come from one Point of an Object, are by the <HI>Cornea</HI> and Humors of the Eye united in a Point of the <HI>Retina,</HI> which is in a streight Line, drawn from the same Point of the Object, thro' the Center of the Eye; and consequently all the Rays, which come from all the Points of an Object, are united on the <HI>Retina,</HI> in the same Order and Proportion as the Points of the Objects are from whence those Rays come.</P>
<P>Therefore the Interposition which these Rays make upon the <HI>Retina,</HI> must be the Image of the Object.</P>
<P>And thus Vision in general is perform'd: But to know what the several Parts of the Globe contribute hereunto, it's needful to observe that the <HI>Cornea</HI> is more convex than any other Part of it; by which Means all the Rays are gather'd to pass thro' the <HI>Pu∣pilla,</HI> and none of them are lost upon the <HI>Uvea.</HI></P>
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>
<P>The <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor being thinnest, and most liquid, easily changes its Figure, when either the <HI>Ligamentum Ciliare</HI> contracts, or both the Oblique Muscles squeeze the Mid∣dle of the Bulb of the Eye, to render it ob∣long, when Objects are too near us.</P>
<P>The streight Fibres of the <HI>Uvea</HI> dilate the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> when there are but few Rays of Light; and the circular Fibres contract it, when there are too many.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Pupilla</HI> is contracted, we see most distinctly; when it is dilated, we see most clearly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Glassy</HI> Humor keeps the <HI>Crystalline</HI> at such a Distance from the <HI>Retina,</HI> as is ne∣cessary for uniting the Rays, which come from one Point of the Object, exactly in one Point of the <HI>Retina.</HI> The Impression of the Object is made upon the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Choroides</HI> is tinctur'd black, that the Rays of Light which pass thro' the <HI>Retina</HI> may not be reflected back again to confuse the Image of the Object.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
<P>Being distinct, Vision consists in the Union of all the Rays which come from one Point of an Object exactly in one Point of the <HI>Re∣tina;</HI> and that the Rays which come from Objects at different Distances, are united at different Distances, behind the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Hu∣mor; they cannot both be exactly united up∣on the <HI>Retina,</HI> therefore the Eye cannot see equally distinct, at the same Time, Ob∣jects at different Distances.</P>
<P>The Optick Nerves pierce the Globe of the Eye, a little on the Inside of the Optick <HI>Axes.</HI> Their external Coat, which is a Production of the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> is continu'd to the <HI>Sclerotis,</HI> as their internal from the <HI>Pia Mater</HI> is to the <HI>Choroides;</HI> and their medullary Fibres passing thro' all, are expan∣ded into the <HI>Retina,</HI> upon which the Images of Objects are painted.</P>
<P>The Center of this Expansion is insensible, and all Rays which fall upon it are lost; and consequently that Point of the Object from which those Rays come, is invisible to the Eye: The Reason of which proceeds proba∣bly from the Blood-Vessels, which enter with
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>the Optick Nerve, and cover this Part of the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>But whatsoever its Cause is, there is a ma∣nifest Advantage in the Optick Nerves being inserted on the Inside of the Optick <HI>Axes:</HI> For if they had pierc'd the Eye in the <HI>Axis,</HI> then the middle Point of every Object had been invisible; and where all Things con∣duce to make us see best, there we had not seen at all.</P>
<P>We must likewise have lost some Part of an Object, if the Optick Nerves had been placed on the Outside of the Optick <HI>Axes:</HI> Because an Object may be so placed, as that all the Rays which come from one Point, may fall upon the Outside of both Eyes: But it is impossible they should fall upon the Inside of both Eyes; and therefore that Point which is lost in one Eye, is visible by the other.</P>
<P>This shall serve for the general The∣ory of VISION: I shall now come to speak of a few Diseases of the Eye, by which Vision is render'd incompleat, or to∣tally
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>destroy'd: And first of the CATA∣RACT.</P>
<P>Before I define a <HI>Cataract,</HI> 'twill be ne∣cessary to premise a few Things, in Order to clear the Way for my Definition: For since the <HI>Hypothesis</HI> I go upon is New, and not yet clearly demonstrated, it would be look'd upon as a strange Peice of Presumption to overlook in the Gross all the different Obje∣ctions which may be made against it, and sa∣tisfie myself with only a few Probabilities (collected out of my own little Experience and Observation) which may seem to make for it.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> I. 'Tis Demonstrated by the Mathematicians, that neither Corpuscles in the <HI>Aqueous</HI> or <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor can be per∣ceiv'd on the <HI>Retina;</HI> and 'tis said by Physi∣cians, that a Beginning of a <HI>Cataract</HI> is a Suffusion of the Eye, when little Clouds, Motes, and Flies, seem to float about in the Air: Now if these Assertions are both true, one would be apt to conclude, that neither the <HI>Aqueous</HI> nor <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor can be the Seat of a <HI>Cataract:</HI> The first is indis∣putable,
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>but the latter is not always True in Fact.</P>
<P>For I have known a good Number of Subject with real Confirm'd <HI>Cataracts,</HI> who never remember to have been thus af∣fected at the Beginning of them.</P>
<P>And altho' some at the Beginning of <HI>Ca∣taracts</HI> are thus affected, 'tis no Proof that the Disease may not be in one or the other of these Humors: For the same Cause which will produce a <HI>Cataract,</HI> may at the same Time the <HI>Cataract</HI> is forming affect also the Fund of the Eye; and by disordering the Blood-Vessels, here and there stop the Influx of the Animal Spirits into the little Filaments of the Optick Nerve which help to make the <HI>Retina.</HI> This will certainly produce them Clouds, Motes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And I have the more Reason to believe this, because I have Couch'd several who af∣ter the <HI>Cataract</HI> has been well supprest, have remain'd blind with a <HI>Gutta Serena;</HI> which is, I suppose, a total Stoppage of the Influx of the Animal Spirits into the nervous Filaments afore-mention'd.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> II. 'Tis suppos'd, that without the Assistance of the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor there could be no Vision; that is, except that Hu∣mor lay always ready to receive the Rays and refract them after they had pass'd the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> they would still proceed with so small a Degree of Refraction that their Place of Converging would be beyond the <HI>Retina;</HI> and by Consequence Vision would be render'd very indistinct, or perhaps the Eye would only perceive a confuss'd Glare of Light; if this Humor was taken away, and this could be demonstrated, 'twould not destroy my Supposition: For I freely acknowledge, that after the Removal of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> (or the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor, which as I proceed I shall use synonymously) Vi∣sion is never so perfectly perform'd as it was before the Eye was diseas'd.</P>
<P>And if the Subjects I have hitherto per∣form'd the Operation upon were of Consi∣deration enough to have given me Pains beyond my Needle, I make no Doubt but I could have fix'd them with Glasses which would have still assisted their Sight, and
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>made them some Amends for the Loss of the aforesaid Humor.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> III. If Vision can be perform'd without this Humor, and the Maxim is true <HI>Quod Natura Nihil agit frustra,</HI> Why was it placed in the Eye?</P>
<P>I answer, 'Tis placed there to enable the Eye to see equally well at different Distan∣ces: For since the Rays proceeding from the luminous Points of nigh Objects diverge more than those from more remote Objects, the Power of making them equally converge at the <HI>Retina</HI> is very probably lodg'd in the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor; which, according to the different Distances of Objects, approaches nigher to, or removes farther from the <HI>Re∣tina,</HI> and perhaps too assumes a different Convexity.</P>
<P>And this I look upon to be unquestiona∣ble: Because I have made it my constant Ob∣servation, That after a successful Depressure of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> the Patient sees best at a Distance something greater than the Eye re∣quires when all its Parts are in their natural
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>Situation; and that if the Object is placed considerably further from, or nearer to the Eye, Vision is render'd indistinct or confus'd.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> IV. But if the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor is depress'd, what becomes of it afterwards? And how is the Cavity fill'd up, which the said Humor possess'd in its natural Situation?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> When I pass my Needle into the Eye, I press directly forward to the <HI>Crystal∣line</HI> Humor, and endeavouring to disengage it from the <HI>Ligamentum Ciliare,</HI> I depress it to the Bottom of the <HI>Vitreous</HI> Humor; when the <HI>Pupilla</HI> immediately seems clear to me, and such a Torrent of confus'd Light rushes into the Eye, as sometimes affrights the Pa∣tient even more than the Puncture of the Needle.</P>
<P>Common Sense tells us, That if a solid Body which is immers'd in a Fluid should be remov'd from one Part of that Fluid in∣to another, it makes no Alteration in the Bulk of the Whole; for whatever Place the Solid is remov'd to, it fills up but so much Space precisely as it did in the Space which it
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>was remov'd from. Immediately upon the Removal of the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor, the <HI>A∣queous</HI> turns in and fills up the Cavity.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> From the different Specifick Gravity of the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor, which in all Pro∣bability is different in different Stages of the Distemper, we may account for what is call'd the Rising again of the <HI>Cataract:</HI> As to what becomes of the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor af∣ter 'tis depress'd, 'tis not unlikely that being broke from the Vessels which nourish'd it, it shrinks by Degrees, and as it were melts in∣to the <HI>Vitreoeus.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Turner</HI> says, A <HI>Cataract</HI> is a Disease of the Eye, in which a Film or Skin grow∣ing before the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> like a Curtain drawn against a Hole letting the Light into a Room, hinders the Passage of the same, till it is depress'd by the Needle, as in Couching.</P>
<P>There is no one of my Profession who pays a greater Veneration to the Authority of that worthy, learned, and ingenious Gentleman, than myself; I am beholden to him that I have a regular, methodical, and I may ven∣ture
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>to say a certain System of Surgery in my Head and Hand; but as he himself (who had always more Business in other Parts of Surgery than a Man of his studious Temper could well attend to) very rarely, if ever perform'd the Operation, I hope 'twill not be thought Pre∣sumption if when I come to speak of the Ope∣ration itself, I should venture to give some Reasons which may seem to thwart his Opi∣nion, and establish my own.</P>
<P>That there are such Films as the Doctor mentions on this Side the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> and in the <HI>Aqueous Humor,</HI> I can readily grant, having met with several of them in the little Course of my Practice: These the Practitioners are al∣low'd to call <HI>Suffusions, Films, &amp;c.</HI> but not <HI>Cataracts;</HI> for I am determin'd to call no Disease of the Eye by this latter Name, ex∣cept that particular One which is to be re∣medied by the Use of the Needle: But the, Case as mention'd by the Doctor can receive no Benefit that I know of by the Operation, nor did I ever attempt to Couch a Patient (tho' I have had several offer'd me) when the Circumstances were as before-mention'd: This I shall endeavour to demonstrate, in descri∣bing the Operation itself.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Authors, with <HI>Vaughion</HI> at the Head of them, imagine a <HI>Cataract</HI> to be a Film separated from the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor, and floating in tine <HI>Aqueous;</HI> that all its Parts are existent in its first Conformation, that it is a <HI>Cystis,</HI> and that <HI>Cystisses</HI> are never form'd <HI>de novo,</HI> but are only Membranes disengag'd from the neighbouring Parts, which increa∣sing in Thickness receive Nourishment from the Parts to which they adhere.</P>
<P>I shall beg Leave to examine this Opinion a little, and however specious and refin'd it may seem, I am afraid we shall find as little Reality in it, as there is in the ordinary Pro∣fession of Friendship amongst the Gentlemen of their Country.</P>
<P>First they say, 'tis a Membrane disengag'd from the <HI>Crystalline,</HI> and floating in the <HI>Aque∣ous;</HI> the first they don't offer to prove, and the latter is false in Fact: For if this pre∣tended disengag'd Membrane should float in the <HI>Aqueous,</HI> the Patient would have at least a Chance of seeing now and then a little, by its being remov'd wholy or in part from before the <HI>Pupilla;</HI> but such a Removal we
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>find never happens; and that after the For∣mation of the <HI>Cataract,</HI> the Eye continues in a constant equal Blindness, till the Cause is remov'd by the Needle: I must beg them then to fix their floating Island, before they pretend to make a rational <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of it; and if they do, I hope they'll be so kind as to let us know to what Membranes they'll join it, and in what Manner it receives Nou∣rishment from them, then we'll talk farther with them.</P>
<P>What have led the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> into the Talk of its being a <HI>Cystis,</HI> and that no <HI>Cy∣stisses</HI> are form'd <HI>de novo,</HI> is the late Disco∣veries made by the Improvements of Micro∣scopes. They are wonderfully pleas'd with and fond of the Opinion, that every Thing which is proceeds originally from an Egg or Seed; but however true this may be of per∣fect Beings, I don't expect that the same will be asserted of the <HI>Fungus</HI>'s of Trees, and other supernatural Excrescences: I can be very well content to believe, that Sloughs and <HI>Mucus</HI> may be detach'd from several Mem∣branes in the Body, and may afterwards in∣crease by an Addition of the same Matter,
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>and yet there may be no <HI>Cystis;</HI> but I shall prove presently, that 'tis impossible a <HI>Cata∣ract</HI> should be in this Part of the Eye; and that will at once put an End to the Contro∣versie.</P>
<P>What has given me frequent Occsion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reflecting lately, has been the odd Manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our Authors of General Theories; they undertake to describe and define every parti∣cular Disease, with as much Freedom an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Positiveness, as if they had been acquainte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves with a good Number of Patient labouring under such Disease, and had mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Causes, Symptoms, Cure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of it, thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> peculiar Study.</P>
<P>How just a Proceeding this is, will appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the following Definition of a <HI>Cataract</HI> in a late modern Writer of this Sort.</P>
<P><HI>A Suffusion,</HI> says he, <HI>is a thick Foulness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Excrescence, of the</HI> Tunica Cornea, Adnata <HI>or</HI> Aqueous <HI>Humor, which when confirm'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> makes the <HI>Cataract.</HI></HI></P>
<P>According to this Account, any thing which thickens the <HI>Cornea,</HI> or makes the <HI>Aqueous</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>Humor dark and cloudy, may be term'd a <HI>Cataract;</HI> for he seems to use the Word <HI>Ca∣taract</HI> not as any particular Disease, but only as something which shall darken and obscure the Sight, by hindring the Transmission of the Rays of Light. Thus the <HI>Albugo, Pterygium, Hyopyon,</HI> or the Viscidity of the <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor, frequently consequent upon an <HI>Oph∣thalmia,</HI> may be justly deem'd a <HI>Cataract.</HI> But how this squares with the real Notion of this Disease, and its Cure, I shall leave my Readers after a few Pages to determine.</P>
<P>But passing over all the different Definitions and Surmises of others, I shall take the Li∣berty (for Reasons which I shall give after∣wards) to define it in the following Manner.</P>
<P>A <HI>Cataract</HI> is a Disease of the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor, whereby the said Humor is totally or at least one Side of it render'd opake: The Humor in this diseas'd State reflect all or most of the Rays of Light, instead of trans∣mitting them to the <HI>Retina;</HI> in Consequence of which, the Humor appears whitish, bluish, yellowish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Eye is blind.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>
<HEAD>CAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>Any Blow or Shock, which may alter the particular Position of the Particles of which this Humor is compos'd: for to make a Body diaphanous, 'tis not only necessary that it should be made of such particular Particles, but that those Particles should be combin'd and united after a particular Manner. Thus Salts, wet Paper, or the <HI>Oculus Mundi</HI> Stone, grow opake by being dried; Horn, by being scrap'd; Glass, by being reduc'd to Powder, or otherwise flaw'd; Turpentine, by being stirr'd about with Water till they mix im∣perfectly.</P>
<P>The Matter which is separated for the na∣tural Nourishment of this Humor from the Blood, may from the too great Viscidity of the Blood itself, either be separated in too small a Quantity, (the Glands and Strainers of these Parts being exceeding fine) and by this Atro∣phy the Humors may grow dry and opake, as Paper, Salts, <HI>Oculus Mundi</HI> Stone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or otherwise upon a Fever or <HI>Ophthalmia,</HI> the Vessels leading to this Humor may be so enlarg'd, as to admit Particles of an improper
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>Figure or Magnitude: The Heterogeneous Particles, (if I may so call them) instead of properly nourishing the Humor, may be lodg'd irregularly in its Pores, (as Water and Turpentine as above) and by destroying that Equality which we are told is necessary to Transparency, render the Humor opake.</P>
<P>It may be caus'd by violent Grief, which occasions a more than natural Secretion of Tears from an adjacent Part; this may from a Continuance make so great a Revulsion, that the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor may probably grow dry, or suffer Diminution, for Want of its usual Supplies. I have Reasons to imagine this, because in Eyes thus diseas'd I have found this Humor much smaller than ordi∣nary.</P>
<P>It may and often does proceed from an un∣skillful Treating of the Eye in an <HI>Ophthal∣mia,</HI> whilst there is a more than ordinary Flux of Matter upon the Parts which seems to in∣treat a Passage thro' the Coats: Instead of al∣luring it forwards by kind Discutients, I have too frequently known it drove back by cold Repellents; and by lodging itself in the Coats
<PB N="54" REF="52"/>and Humors of the Eye, at once deprive it of its Use and Beauty.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Pitcarn,</HI> in speaking of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> says, <HI>Some ascribe it to the thickning or co∣agulating of the</HI> Aqueous <HI>Humor, and others to that of the</HI> Crystalline: <HI>But these know No∣thing of the Nature of the Eye; for Corpus∣cles floating in the</HI> Aqueous <HI>or</HI> Crystalline <HI>Humo, can't be prerceiv'd on the</HI> Retina.</P>
<P>For once I'll run the Risque of having my Understanding censur'd, and venture to say. That tho' the Corpuscles themselves are not seen being within the Eye, yet they can hin∣der the Eye from discerning every distinct Part of any Object which is without it: And these little Specks of Darkness, amidst a Glare of Light, are mistaken by the Patient for Some∣thing positive, when they are only Privations; and the Effect would be the same, if there were any Stoppages in the small nervous Fi∣laments which compose the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Doctor's Philosophy is true, when he says they can't be seen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But if he would pretend to inferr from thence, that they can
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>be no Causes why the Eye can't see other Things, his Consequence is false; and clearly demonstrated to be so, by Mr. <HI>Cheselden</HI> at the End of his ANATOMY.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>DIAGNOSTICK.</HEAD>
<P>'Tis known by a Diminution of Sight in the Patient, and by Something which appears like a Bluish Cloud behind the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> tho' the Colour of it often varies: I do not yet know whether there be any Reason given for the Variety of Colours, but I have observ'd that the Green and Yellow are generally in old Subjects.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>PROGNOSTICK.</HEAD>
<P>Not so rnuch the Age of the Person is to be consider'd, as the Age and Ripeness of the <HI>Cataract:</HI> I have seen both very young and very old Subjects couch'd with Success, tho' the best Prognostick is certain to be made in a middle Age and good Habit.</P>
<P>If a Surgeon understands the Operation, and is at all able to judge when the <HI>Cata∣ract</HI> is ripe for it, he has a great deal of Reason to promise Success.</P>
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>
<P>If an uncommon Inflammation supervenes, which he can't foresee, and sometimes 'tis impossible for him to prevent, he is not to be blam'd if he misses of Success, tho' he had seem'd pretty positive in promising it both to his Patient and himself.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Regimen</HI> before the Operation.</HEAD>
<P>In Order to prevent an <HI>Ophthalmia,</HI> use proper Evacuations, as Bleeding, Lenient Pur∣gatives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a few Days before the Opera∣tion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OPERATION.</HEAD>
<P>The most temperate Seasons are the best, for which Reason I make Choice of <HI>Spring</HI> or <HI>Autumn.</HI> 'Tis requisite the Day should be fine and clear, and the Light well chosen. I oblige the Patient to recline his Head back∣wards upon a Pillow, the Pillow is supported by the Back of a Chair of a proper Heighth; behind the Patient an Assistant is plac'd, to keep his Head without Motion; 'twill be necessary too for a Person on each Side, to secure the Hands of the Patient; for I have seen very ill Consequences attend the Neglect
<PB N="57" REF="55"/>of this: Having thus prepar'd the Patient, I place myself on a Stool, rais'd by Pillows ac∣cording to the Heighth of the Subject, till I have a full Command of the Patient's EYE; then bidding him turn his Eye towards his Nose, so that the <HI>Tunica Conjunctiva</HI> may be sufficiently apparent, I plunge my Needle directly into the <HI>Vitreous</HI> Humor, thro' the <HI>Tunica Conjunctiva,</HI> about the Distance of the Tenth Part of an Inch from the <HI>Cornea;</HI> then thrusting it boldly to the upper Part of the <HI>Crystalline,</HI> gently turn the flat Part of my Needle on the Top of the <HI>Cataract;</HI> by which Means I have a greater Surface upon it, and the <HI>Cataract</HI> consequently less liable to slip from under my Needle: I depress it ve∣ry slowly, and place it as I think at the Bot∣tom of the <HI>Vitreous</HI> Humor; I don't immedi∣ately remove my Needle off it, but continue it depress'd for about Half a Minute, for Rea∣sons which I shall give when I come to speak of the Causes of a <HI>Cataract</HI>'s rising again: After this, I draw my Needle back about the Sixth Part of an Inch; and gently raising the Point, take it quite out of the EYE.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>
<HEAD><HI>Regimen</HI> after the Operation.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after the Operation I apply a Repellant Compress, and order the Patient to be put to Bed, raising his Head something higher than usual; and after suffering of him to remain quiet a few Hours, I renew my dres∣sing, and begin to treat him with a cool <HI>Re∣gimen,</HI> proper Diet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as in a symptoma∣tical Fever: This I do to second the Inten∣tion of the former <HI>Regimen;</HI> notwithstanding which, an <HI>Ophthalmia</HI> in Spite of all I can do will sometimes supervene, and then it must be treated as such.</P>
<P>These <HI>Ophthalmia's</HI> are sometimes so vio∣lent as to become difficult of Cure, and of∣ten produce all the Effects, and perhaps too really bring that Distemper upon the Eye call'd <HI>Gutta Serena.</HI> This last mention'd Di∣sease is seated on the <HI>Retina,</HI> and may be brought on by any Thing which will enlarge the Capillary Arteries of that Membrane; for they lying contiguous to the Nerves, and their Diameters being increas'd, the interme∣diate Nerves are so press'd betwixt them, that the Influx of the Animal Spirits is intirely pro∣hibited,
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>and all Commumication is cut off be∣twixt them and the Original of the Optick Nerves in the Brain, which is the <HI>Commune Sensorium:</HI> Thus tho' the <HI>Cataract</HI> conti∣nues well depress'd, and the Eye in all Appea∣rance perfectly clear, yet the Patient will re∣main Blind, and 'tis too often beyond the Reach of Art to give him any Assistance.</P>
<P>However, I generally use all the Evacu∣ations proper in a stubborn <HI>Ophthalmia,</HI> with Calomel, Purgatives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and keep the Pa∣tient to an attenuating Diet; obliging him to abstain from all viscid Nutriments, and to use much Exercise: This Method I have known to meet with its desir'd Success.</P>
<P>There are many other Causes besides this Common One, which may render the Ope∣ration unsuccessful; first, the Rising again of the <HI>Cataract.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cataract</HI> will sometimes rise again, even before the Needle is out of the Eye: There are many specious Reasons to be as∣sign'd for it, tho' perhaps none of them true; however I shall mention what I have hitherto
<PB N="60" REF="58"/>imagin'd, not without a Promise to correct any Thing I shall here say if I find it con∣tradicted by future Practice.</P>
<P>The first Reason (which is perhaps more obvious to others than myself) is, That the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor being diseas'd, is become specifically lighter than the <HI>Vitreous;</HI> and that being disengag'd from the Membranes to which it in some Measure adhered, and de∣press'd to the Bottom of the <HI>Vitreous,</HI> upon Removal of the Needle it ascends by its own specifick Levity, and places itself at or near the Place from whence it was remov'd.</P>
<P>The next is, That consisting of very gluti∣nous Parts, and being join'd perhaps to the <HI>Uvea,</HI> the Needle only removes the main Body, which still remains attach'd to the <HI>Uvea</HI> by certain small elastick Filaments; which as soon as the Needle is remov'd con∣tract themselves, and again lift up the <HI>Cry∣stalline</HI> Humor into its natural Position.</P>
<P>If it remains depress'd for some Days and afterwards rises again, but being a second or third Time depress'd it continues where
<PB N="61" REF="59"/>you would place it, it may proceed from an increas'd Viscidity in the Humor itself, or from a Rarefaction of that Fluid into which it's immers'd; both of which will perhaps be consequent upon an Inflammation, perhaps from an Elasticity in the <HI>Cornea,</HI> whereby the <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor may be immediately thrust into its Place by Removal of the <HI>Crystalline;</HI> which Elasticity and Contraction of the <HI>Cor∣nea,</HI> may possibly be too great to be overcome by the diffrent specifick Gravity of the <HI>Cry∣stalline.</HI></P>
<P>But I must confess, if I was to give my Opinion of the general Cause of the Rising again of the <HI>Cataract</HI> immediately upon its being depress'd, I should imagine it to be the lifting up the Point of the Needle before I withdraw it very near back again to the Place from whence I remov'd the <HI>Cataract.</HI> For I imagine that the specifick Gravity of the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor, (being very little different if at all from that of the <HI>Vitreous</HI>) would ne∣ver be sufficient to overcome the Resistance of the said <HI>Vitreous</HI> Humor, which is a very viscid and tenacious Fluid, unless there was a Passage made for it to rise again by that
<PB N="62" REF="60"/>Motion of the Needle which I have just now ex∣press'd; and therefore hold it necessary that after the <HI>Cataract</HI> is depress'd, the Needle ought to be kept some Time upon it, that the Fluid above it may have Time perfectly to reunite; so as becoming all over equally tenacious, it may be impower'd to keep the <HI>Cataract</HI> in the Position we would have it.</P>
<P>Another Cause of ill Success is, the woun∣ding the <HI>Uvea</HI> or <HI>Iris;</HI> the Consequence of which will be an irregular Form of the <HI>Pu∣pilla,</HI> some of which I have seen intirely clos'd: However if they are not so, there is al∣ways such a Callosity upon the wounded Membrane, as stops up the <HI>Pupilla</HI> in one Part, and leaves such an Opening of it on the other, that by stopping up the Rays where they should pass, and suffering them to pass where they should not, the Eye is render'd intirely useless.</P>
<P>These Parts too, when wounded, some∣times ulcerate; by which Ulceration, the whole Coats and Humors of the Eye become one common Mass of <HI>Pus,</HI> and the Eye in∣tirely sinks.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="61"/>
<P>The Reason that a Person is oblig'd to wound the <HI>Uvea</HI> and <HI>Iris</HI> is, when he would endeavour to remove a Film which lies in the <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor, or on this Side the <HI>Pupilla.</HI> And this, till I know better, I shall call an <HI>Injudicious Practice.</HI></P>
<P>It often happens that the said Coats are wounded thro' the Fault of the Patient, even when the Operation is the most judiciously performed; for he not havingCourage to keep his Eye in the Position he was directed, and by endeavouring to fly from the Pain which is given by the first Puncture of the Needle, which he imagines is only to be done by Mo∣tion, and not being able to move his Eye any farther towards the great <HI>Canthus,</HI> turns it back against the Point or Edge of the Needle; and by this Means, in Spite of all the Art or Address of the Surgeon, will with that Mo∣tion wound the Coats above-mention'd: But this last Accident does not happen to a Man who knows what he is doing, perhaps above Once in Twenty Times.</P>
<P>Another Reason of ill Success is, the <HI>Cata∣ract</HI> proving Milky: To be able to deter∣mine
<PB N="64" REF="62"/>mine whether 'tis so or not before I touch it with my Needle I have not yet learn'd, and should be glad to be inform'd by any Body who has.</P>
<P>Another Cause of ill Success, which is also sometimes attributed to the Surgeon, may be a strange Fondness of Sight, which engages the Patient after having been couch'd Three or Four Days to pull off the Dressings in the Absence of the Surgeon; by which he expo∣sing the Eye to the Assaults of the open Air, brings on that <HI>Ophthalmia</HI> which we were endeavouring to prevent: In this Case he him∣self is blamable, and not the Surgeon, for all the ill Consequences that may attend it, one of which I have found often to be the intire Loss of Sight.</P>
<P>Another Misfortune, which too frequently attends the unhappy Patient, is, when the <HI>Ca∣taract</HI> is accompanied with a <HI>Gutta Serena,</HI> perhaps of as long standing as the <HI>Cataract</HI> itself; this we find when upon depressing the <HI>Cataract,</HI> (and there's no Possibility of judg∣ing of it before) and the <HI>Pupilla</HI> remaining clear, the Patient notwithstanding continues
<PB N="65" REF="63"/>in total Darkness: This Case is indeed de∣plorable. I should be unwilling to think that there was any Part of Mankind such Strangers to common Sense, as to imagine this to be a Fault of the Surgeon; but, I myself have more than once been calumnia∣ted on this very Account: I can't help say∣ing, I have been unfairly dealt with by some of the Gentlemen of my own Profession, who have misrepresented the Cases, and deluded the common People, as well as injured me; this was the Case of Three Subjects that I lately Couch'd in <HI>Yarmouth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I have met with the same Treat∣ment on Account of a Subject which I Cut for the Stone, where I will undertake to de∣monstrate to any Man in <HI>England,</HI> that it was as impossible to meet with Success in that Operation as it was circumstanc'd, as it is to succeed in the Operation of Couching where the <HI>Cataract</HI> is attended with a <HI>Gutta Serena;</HI> for unless a Man could directly look into the Body in the one Case, or down to the Bottom of the Eye in the other, he can be no more able to make a positive Progno∣stick, than he would be to alter the Circum∣stances.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="64"/>
<P>I shall make here another Observation, That where there is a <HI>Cataract</HI> in one Eye and the other Eye sound and good, the Pa∣tient don't ought to be encourag'd to suffer the diseas'd Eye to be Couch'd; because the Symptoms which may possibly attend it, may be the Occasion of the Loss of both.</P>
<P>I shall take the Liberty of mentioning a Case of my own, wherein I have met with some of the afore-mention'd Accidents. A∣bout Five Months since, a Patient came to me with a Confirm'd <HI>Cataract</HI> in one Eye, and a Suffusion in the other. I found the <HI>Ca∣taract</HI> good, and (after the common Prepa∣rations) depress'd it with no apparent ill Ac∣cident. The Eye continu'd clear, and the Patient saw for some Days: At which Time an Inflammation came on, which equally af∣fected both Eyes; and, notwithstanding all I could do to abate it, the Coats and Hu∣mors were so thicken'd by it, that the Eye which had the Suffusion in it became totally blind: And some Time after, that which I had couch'd was in like Manner intirely de∣priv'd of Sight; tho' the <HI>Cataract</HI> remain depress'd, and the <HI>Pupilla</HI> perfectly clear.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="65"/>
<P><HI>Observation.</HI> It seems pretty plain, That the Suffusion above-mention'd was Nothing more than the Beginning of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> cau∣sed by the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor growing thick and muddy: And that this Inflammation, by increasing the Viscidity of the Matter separa∣ted for the Nourishment of the said Humor, increas'd the Thickness so, as to render the Humor intirely opake; or in other Terms, ripen'd the <HI>Cataract.</HI> The Reason why I did not venture to Couch it afterwards was, an uncommon Dilatation of the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> which had been from the Beginning of the Suffusion: The Disease of the other was a direct <HI>Gutta Serena,</HI> caus'd by the Inflammation in the Manner before deserib'd.</P>
<P>The Subject I have been treating of being altogether new, I shall beg Leave to add the following Queries, to be consider'd by the Gentlemen of my Profession, not troubling myself whether they make for or against my <HI>Hypothesis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> I. Whether the Reason of the Dila∣ation of the <HI>Pupilla</HI> in one Eye and not the her may not be this: That the <HI>Crystalline</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="66"/>Humor being render'd somewhat less transpa¦rent than formerly, the Patient finds that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rays of Light do not strike so clearly and for cibly as they us'd to do; or in other Words the Eye is darker than in its natural State To amend which, he naturally and one may almost say involuntarily dilates the <HI>Pupilla</HI> in order to receive more Rays of Light, and recompense the Defect of the diseas'd Hu∣mor?</P>
<P>The same is done whenever we want to see Objects in the Dark; but in this case the Cause remaining constant, the Dilatation is constant too, till the <HI>Pupilla</HI> by the frequent Use of this Motion becomes actually wider than it ought naturally to be. In such a Dilatation as I here mention, we can't promise any great Success from the Use of the Needle: For was the Humor itself perfectly clear, such a dila∣ted <HI>Pupilla</HI> would admit such a Glare and Flow of Rays to the <HI>Retina,</HI> as would ren∣der Vision confus'd and indistinct; much less can we hope to have a good Eye, when that Humor so necessary to Vision is intirely re∣moved.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="67"/>
<P><HI>Query</HI> II. Whether the <HI>Cataract</HI> some∣times appearing at first in a white Point, and afterwards spreading itself like a Line drawn from a Center to a Circumference, is not a Proof that 'tis a transparent Body already form'd, growing thick and cloudy, rather than the Beginning of a new Membrane?</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Composition of the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor, in the Anatomy of the Eye.</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> III. Whether <HI>Cataracts</HI> very old and discolour'd, declining in the same Man∣ner, and becoming angulous and uneven, is not a Proof of the same Thing?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> IV. Whether it would not be worth while to observe after the Couching a young Subject, if the same Subject is ever troubled with a second <HI>Cataract,</HI> properly distingui∣shing whether it be the same <HI>Cataract</HI> risen again or not? And this I think is best to be done, by observing the Interval of Time which passes between his being Couch'd and the Ap∣pearance of this second <HI>Cataract.</HI> Whe∣ther if this Observation be just, and a second <HI>Cataract</HI> be form'd in the same Eye, and
<PB N="70" REF="68"/>in the same Subject, this would not destroy my <HI>Hypothesis?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> V. Whether our not being able to remove a <HI>Cataract</HI> at its first Appearance, is not a Proof that 'tis not the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Hu∣mor? Because for all what we know certain∣ly, the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor is equally remo∣vable at all Times.</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> VI. Whether or no in that Stage of the Disease which we call a <HI>Milky Cata∣ract,</HI> there may not be such a Solution of Continuity of the Parts of the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Hu∣mor, as may suffer the Needle to pass back∣wards and forwards in it, without being able to remove it out of its Place?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> VII. And whether in a farther Stage of this Disease, the Parts may not again close, and stick together in such a Manner, as that the whole Body of the Humor may be at once remov'd, by only pressing upon a parti∣cular Part of it?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> VIII. Whether there may not be a Gradation of Colouring settled from Sir <HI>Isaac
<PB N="71" REF="69"/>Newton's</HI> Theory, beginning at a light Blue and ending at a greenish Yellow; whereby we might be able to determine the exact Age of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> as soon as we see it? And whether such a particular Colour will or will not successfully bear the Needle?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> IX. Whether 'tis not possible to in∣vent a <HI>Speculum Oculi,</HI> which may keep the Globe of the Eye without Motion, and with∣out giving that Pain to the Patient which too frequently contributes to the bringing on of an Inflammation? I mention this, because I have seen so many Inconveniencies attend the Use of the Common <HI>Speculum Oculi;</HI> that, ra∣ther than use it myself, I have chose to have Nothing to assist me, except the Pressure of the Thumb and Finger?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> X. Whether a Trembling, which I have observ'd in the <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor some Time after Couching, does not proceed from a Loss of Part of that Humor in Couching? And whether this Trembling is one Reason why the Rays of Light pass confus'd into the Eye?</P>
<PB N="72" REF="70"/>
<P><HI>Query</HI> XI. Whether there is Room for the Needle to pass between the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Hu∣mor and the <HI>Uvea,</HI> without removing the former so as to spoil the Eye, or cutting or lacerating the latter?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> XII. Whether, if this last is practi∣cable, there's not a Possibility of removing a Film that may be in the Forepart of the <HI>Pu∣pilla,</HI> notwithstanding the Needle enters in at the Backpart of it?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> XIII. Whether there might not be a nice Experiment made, by placing an Eye like a <HI>Lens</HI> in the Hole of a dark Chamber? I think (if I remember rightly) I have met with the following Account in an Author of Experimental Philosophy. Stripping the Fund of the Eye of its Integuments, he plac'd it as above-mention'd; and holding a Peice of white Paper within the Room, at a small Distance from the Eye, he distinctly percei∣ved the Images of all Objects from without painted upon the Paper; as they would have been upon the <HI>Retina,</HI> if the Eye had been in its natural Position.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="71"/>
<P>Had a nice Hand been there who would have gon on the Outside and with a Needle as in Couching depress'd the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Hu∣mor, and if notwithstanding this Depression the Person within could still perceive the I∣mages as before, it would be a certain Proof that the Eye might see, notwithstanding the Loss of the <HI>Crystalline</HI> Humor.</P>
<P>The Eye should be taken down, and disse∣cted; and by observing in what Part the <HI>Cry∣stalline</HI> Humor after its Removal was lodg'd, we should receive a great Light into the Theory of Couching, and much Satisfaction, as to the Truth of this <HI>Hypothesis.</HI></P>
<P>I only mention this as it seems to me pos∣sible, without being able to determine whe∣ther 'tis practicable or not.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>Before I conclude, I thought it my Duty to mention, (and in the Words of a Great Man) That as a candid and sincere Beha∣viour ought to be preferr'd to all other Con∣siderations, I would not let my Heart re∣proach
<PB N="74" REF="72"/>me with a Consciousness of having gain'd even the Possibility of a Praise, which is not in every Particular my Right: I therefore thought proper to acknowledge, that I am oblig'd to a very ingenious Gentle∣man (whom I have the Honour to be ac∣quainted with) for Two or Three Hints that he has given me in the latter Part of this short Dissertation, which otherwise pro∣bably might have been omitted.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> I believe it will be necessary to ob∣serve to such Persons as are not Judges of the Subject I have been treating of, That I have therein demonstrated the Reason of my not meeting with Success in some Patients that I have Couch'd, particularly in <HI>Yarmouth.</HI></P>
