<HEAD>EDWIN AND ANGELINA.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A BALLAD.</HEAD>
<HEAD>BY MR. GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Printed for the Amusement of the COUNTESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEIGN, saint-like tenant of the dale,</L>
<L>To guide my nightly way</L>
<L>To yonder fire, that chears the vale</L>
<L>With hospitable ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For here, deserted, as I tread</L>
<L>With fainting steps and slow,</L>
<L>The wild, immeasurably spread,</L>
<L>Seems lengthening as I go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forbear, my son, the sage replies,</L>
<L>To tempt the lonely gloom,</L>
<L>For yonder faithless phantom flies</L>
<L>To lure thee to thy doom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<L>Here to the houseless child of want</L>
<L>My door is open still,</L>
<L>And tho' my portion is but scant,</L>
<L>I give it with good will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then turn to-night, and freely share</L>
<L>Whate'er my cell bestows,</L>
<L>My rushy couch and frugal fare,</L>
<L>My blessing and repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No flocks, that range the valley free,</L>
<L>To slaughter I condemn;</L>
<L>Taught by that Power that pities me,</L>
<L>I learn to pity them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But from the mountain's grassy side</L>
<L>A guiltless feast I bring,</L>
<L>A scrip with herbs and fruits supply'd,</L>
<L>And water from the spring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then turn to-night, thy cares forego,</L>
<L>All earth-born cares are wrong;</L>
<L>"Man wants but little here below,</L>
<L>"Nor wants that little long."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soft as the dew from heav'n descends,</L>
<L>His gentle accents fell,</L>
<L>The modest stranger lowly bends,</L>
<L>And follows to the cell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<L>Far in a wilderness obscure</L>
<L>The lonely mansion lay,</L>
<L>A refuge to th' unshelter'd poor</L>
<L>And strangers led astray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No stores beneath its humble thatch</L>
<L>Requir'd a master's care,</L>
<L>The wicket, op'ning with a latch,</L>
<L>Receiv'd the harmless pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, when busy crowds retire</L>
<L>To take their evening rest,</L>
<L>The hermit trim'd his little fire,</L>
<L>And chear'd his pensive guest;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And spread his vegetable store,</L>
<L>And gaily prest and smil'd,</L>
<L>And, skill'd in legendary lore,</L>
<L>The ling'ring hours beguil'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While round, in sympathetic mirth,</L>
<L>Its tricks the kitten tries,</L>
<L>The cricket chirrups in the hearth,</L>
<L>The crackling faggot flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But nothing mirthful could assuage</L>
<L>The pensive stranger's woe,</L>
<L>For grief had seiz'd his early age,</L>
<L>And tears would often flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<L>His rising cares the hermit spy'd,</L>
<L>With answering care opprest;</L>
<L>And whence, unhappy youth, he cry'd,</L>
<L>The sorrows of thy breast?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From better habitations spurn'd,</L>
<L>Reluctant dost thou rove,</L>
<L>Or grieve for friendship unreturn'd,</L>
<L>Or unregarded love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, what is friendship? but a name,</L>
<L>A charm that lulls to sleep,</L>
<L>A shade that follows wealth or fame,</L>
<L>But leaves the wretch to weep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And what is love? an empty sound,</L>
<L>The modern fair one's jest;</L>
<L>On earth unseen, or only found</L>
<L>To warm the turtle's nest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For shame, fond youth, thy sorrows hush,</L>
<L>And spurn the sex, he said,</L>
<L>But while he spoke, a rising blush</L>
<L>His love-lorn guest betray'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Surpriz'd he sees new beauties rise</L>
<L>Expanding to the view,</L>
<L>Like colours o'er the morning skies,</L>
<L>As bright, as transient too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<L>The bashful look, the rising breast</L>
<L>Alternate spread alarms,</L>
<L>The lovely stranger stands confest</L>
<L>A maid in all her charms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And ah! forgive a stranger rude,</L>
<L>A thing forlorn, she cried,</L>
<L>Whose feet unhallow'd thus intrude</L>
<L>Where heaven and you reside.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgive, and let thy pious care</L>
<L>An heart's distress allay,</L>
<L>That seeks repose, but finds despair</L>
<L>Companion of the way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My father liv'd, of high degree</L>
<L>Remote beside the Tyne,</L>
<L>And as he had but only me,</L>
<L>Whate'er he had was mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To win me from his tender arms</L>
<L>Unnumber'd suitors came,</L>
<L>Their chief pretence my flatter'd charms,</L>
<L>My wealth perhaps their aim.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each hour the mercenary crowd</L>
<L>With glitt'ring proffers strove;</L>
<L>Among the rest young Edwin bow'd,</L>
<L>Who offer'd only love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<L>In humble simplest habit clad,</L>
<L>No wealth nor power had he;</L>
<L>Wisdom and worth were all he had,</L>
<L>And these were all to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whene'er he spoke amidst the train,</L>
<L>How would my heart attend!</L>
<L>And still delighted even to pain,</L>
<L>How sigh for such a friend!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when a little rest I sought</L>
<L>In sleep's refreshing arms,</L>
<L>How have I mended what he taught,</L>
<L>And lent him fancied charms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still (and woe betide the hour)</L>
<L>I spurn'd him from my side,</L>
<L>And still with ill dissembled power,</L>
<L>Repaid his love with pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Till, quite dejected with my scorn,</L>
<L>He left me to deplore,</L>
<L>And sought a solitude forlorn,</L>
<L>And ne'er was heard of more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then since he perish'd by my fault,</L>
<L>This pilgrimage I pay,</L>
<L>I'll seek the solitude he sought,</L>
<L>And stretch me where he lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<L>And there in shelt'ring thickets hid,</L>
<L>I'll linger till I die;</L>
<L>'Twas thus for me my lover did,</L>
<L>And so for him will I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou shalt not thus, the hermit cried,</L>
<L>And clasp'd her to his breast.</L>
<L>Th' astonish'd fair-one turn'd to chide,</L>
<L>'Twas EDWIN's self that prest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For now no longer could he hide</L>
<L>What first to hide he strove,</L>
<L>His looks resume their youthful pride,</L>
<L>And flush with honest love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Turn, ANGELINA, ever dear,</L>
<L>My charmer, turn to see</L>
<L>Thy own, thy long-lost EDWIN here,</L>
<L>Restor'd to love and thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus let me hold thee to my heart,</L>
<L>And every care resign,</L>
<L>And shall we never, never part,</L>
<L>My life, my all that's mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No, never from this hour to part,</L>
<L>Our love shall still be new,</L>
<L>And the last sigh that rends thy heart</L>
<L>Shall break thy EDWIN's too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<L>Here amidst sylvan bow'rs we'll rove,</L>
<L>From lawn to woodland stray,</L>
<L>Blest as the songsters of the grove,</L>
<L>And innocent as they.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To all that want, and all that wail,</L>
<L>Our pity shall be given,</L>
<L>And when this life of love shall fail,</L>
<L>We'll love it again in heaven.</L>
