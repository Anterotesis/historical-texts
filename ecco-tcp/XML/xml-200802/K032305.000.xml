<HEAD>To the Magnificent COMPANY of UPHOLDERS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CƲstom has made some Things absolutely necessary, and two Sheets without a Dedication, or a Preface, by way of Excuse, would be an unpardonable In∣decency: To avoid which, I was considering at whose Feet to lay these following Scenes. First I thought of offering it to all those young Wives who had sold them∣selves for Money, and been inter'd with Misery from the first Day of their Marriage; but supposing their chief Pleasure to consist in Pride, and that they had rather gra∣tify their Ambition in the Arms of a Fool, or Fourscore, than wed a Man of Sense of narrower Fortunes, I con∣cluded 'em unworthy of my Notice.</P>
<P>Then the Race of Old Men presented themselves in my Mind, who, despising Women of their own Years, marry Girls of fifteen, by which they keep open House for all the young Fellows in Town, in order to encre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se their Families, and make their Tables flourish like the Vine: But my Aversion to Fools of all Kinds, made me decline them too.</P>
<P>At last, casting my Eyes upon the Title of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rce, I found it could justly belong to none but the Magnificent Company of <HI>Upholders,</HI> whom the judicious Censor of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has so often condescended to mention; to you then, worthy Sirs, whose solemn Train keeps up the pompous State of Beauty, beyond the Limits of a Gasp of Breath, and draws the gazing World to admire, even after Death; to you this Piece I Dedicate; 'tis but Reason that you should receive some Tribute from us Living, who so truly mourn us dead.

you? All Ranks and Conditions are obliged to you; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Aged and the Young, the Generous and the Miser, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well descended and the boser born.

What an immense Sum might be rais'd from your Art to carry on the War, would you, like true <HI>Briton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> exert your Power? The People being fond of Sights, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might not be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther'd at a Funeral, when the Rooms a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> clad in Sable, the Body dressd out with all your skilfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Care, the Tapers burning in their Silver Socke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weeping Virgins fixt like Statues round, and aromat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gums persume the Chambers, I think it preferable to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Puppet Show, and a Peny a Head for all the Curiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would, I dare be positive, amount to more than the Candl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tax; and so make Death subservient to the Living.</P>
<P>But this, Gentlemen, I leave to your superior Judgme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Politick Principles; and only beg leave to remind yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that in this crouded Town, there are a Prodigious Numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI>'s Dead Men, that swarm about Streets therefore, for the Sakes of the most ingenious Part of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kind, you ought to take Care to interr them out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Way, since he that does no Good in his Generation, shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not be reckon'd among the Living.</P>
<P>And now to conclude, Gentlemen, I hope you'll pard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this Liberty I have taken, and accept this as a Token <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Respect I bear your noble Society: I honour you tho' have no Desire of falling into your Hands, but I thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we Poets are in no Danger of that, since our real Esta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦lies in the Brain, and our personal consists in two or th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> loose Scenes, a few Couplets for the Tag of an Act, and slight Sketch for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong, and as I take it, you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over-fond of Paper-Credit, where there is no Probabili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of recovering the Debt: So wishing you better Custome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I expect no Return, but am proud of subscribing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> self,</P>
