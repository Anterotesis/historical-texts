<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO JOHN STRUTT, ESQ. MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR MALDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY admiration of your unfeigned pa∣triotism, was not excited, but con∣firmed by that singular, and manly in∣stance, which made you revered by all, who could feel for the tarnished glory of their country!—To that public virtue in the indi∣vidual I esteem, this Play is disinterestedly inscribed.—</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TO prepare MASSINGER'S Tragi-Comedy, THE PICTURE, for a modern entertainment, proved a more arduous task than was at first conceived. After giving a different turn to the drama, by making the changes of the Picture, the effects of <HI>Eugenius</HI>'s jealousy, instead of the magic art of <HI>Baptista,</HI> and expunging the gross indelicacies which overran the play, it was found that most of the cha∣racters required a little fresh modelling to complete the design of the present undertaking. Hence the necessity of new-writing no inconsiderable part of the dialogue, in imitation of the old Dramatist. Though enamoured with the beauties of the antique structure, the Alterer set about its reparation with the utmost dissidence, fearing, like an unskilful ar∣chitect, he might destroy those venerable features he could not improve! What has been his success, the public decision must determine.</P>
<P>The same kind of irregular and broken measure, through necessity still prevails, except where the language could be reduced to the heroic verse without impairing the spirit of the dialogue.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
As to the <HI>unities,</HI>—being so totally disregarded by MASSINGER himself, no use could possibly be made of them in the present alteration.</P>
<P>The performance of the MAGIC PICTURE was every thing that an Author could expect, or wish for. The friendship and liberality of Mr. HARRIS were zealously exerted on the occasion. Mr. SHIELD aided it with his harmonic powers; and every performer, by a well sustained character, united in it's support: but Miss YOUNGE'S SOPHIA was too striking a re∣presentation not to demand a particular acknow∣ledgment.—To this fortunate combination of talents, THE MAGIC PICTURE chiefly stands indebted for the very flattering reception with which it has been honored!</P>

<L>It was well fought on both sides, and almost</L>
<L>With equal fortune; it continuing doubtful</L>
<L>Upon whose tents plum'd victory would take</L>
<L>Her glorious stand. Impatient of delay,</L>
<L>With the flower of our prime gentlemen, I charg'd</L>
<L>Their main battalia, and with their assistance</L>

Broke in; but when I was almost assur'd</L>
<L>They were routed, by a stratagem</L>

<L>I do remember that they stopp'd their noses</L>

<L>My doubtful innocence.</L>
<L>When you went to the wars,</L>
<L>I set no spy upon you, to observe</L>
<L>Which way you wander'd, though our sex, by nature,</L>
<L>Is subject to suspicions; for I fix'd</L>
<L>My confidence on your try'd loyalty:</L>
<L>But to deal as you did, 'gainst your reason,</L>
<L>With magic nonsense to survey my actions,</L>
<L>Was more than woman's weakness: therefore know,</L>
<L>And 'tis my boon unto the King, I do</L>
<L>Desire a separation from your bed;</L>
<L>For I will spend the remnant of my life</L>
<L>In pray'r, and meditation!</L>

<L>O take pity</L>
<L>Upon my weak condition, or I am</L>
<L>More wretched in your innocence, than if</L>
<L>I had found you guilty. Have you shewn a jewel</L>
<L>Out of the cabinet of your rich mind</L>
<L>To lock it up again?—She turns away—</L>
<L>Will none speak for me? Shame hath robb'd me</L>
<L>Of the use of utterance!</L>
