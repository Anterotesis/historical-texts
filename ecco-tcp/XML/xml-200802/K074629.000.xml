<HEAD>TO Dr THOMAS BLACKLOCK.</HEAD>
<L>TO thee, to whom the equal hand of Heaven,</L>
<L>Though it depriv'd thee of external sight,</L>
<L>The better graces of the mind has given,</L>
<L>Genius, and Learning's thews, and Judgement's light,</L>
<L>And Fortitude, mid undeserved ills,</L>
<L>And wide-embracing Liberality,</L>
<L>Each thought humane which the sweet bosom fills,</L>
<L>And decks the form of saintly Charity,</L>
<L>These rhymes, all roughly woven, do I bear,</L>
<L>Which <HI>thee alone t' amuse</HI> first framed were.</L>
<L>Flattery pursues the <HI>great;</HI> when thee I praise,</L>
<L>Who nought but thy good spirit hast t'impart,</L>
<L>While Truth approves, deny not of my lays,</L>
<L>The guerdon, thy esteem, and friendly heart.</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF the author should say, he did not heartily approve of compositions of this kind, or admire the construc∣tion of the stanza, or think the more highly of any per∣son for clothing his thoughts in the phraseology of Spenser; it might be asked, what induced him to write the following poem? and how he came to lay it before the public? As to the first question, it owes its birth to accident alone. As to the second, he frankly owns, that he flattered himself some merit would be found in it, independent of the uncouth manner and antiquated dress in which it was to appear: and this only he is sensible can justify the publication of it to a reader of taste and discernment.</P>
<P>It may be proper perhaps just to mention the prior part of the fable, of which this is to be supposed a con∣sequence. In the 9th Canto of the 2d Book of the Fairy Queen, <HI>Guyon</HI> and <HI>Arthur</HI> journeying together, arrive at the castle of <HI>Alma,</HI> which they find besieged by <HI>Malaeger</HI> and his crew, whom they engage, and put to the rout. They are courteously received by <HI>Alma,</HI> who shews them her castle. In the chamber of <HI>Memory</HI> they find two books, one called, <HI>The Briton Moniments;</HI> the other, <HI>The Antiquity of Fairy Lond;</HI> an account of these
<PB REF="6"/>
takes up the 10th Canto. In the 11th, <HI>Guyon</HI> departs on his adventures against the <HI>Bower of Bliss,</HI> upon which the enemies of <HI>Alma,</HI> being emboldened, return to the siege. <HI>Arthur</HI> sallies out against them, and after a se∣vere engagement overcomes their chief, by squeezing him to death. His squire brings him back to the castle covered with wounds:</P>
<Q><L>Where many grooms and squires ready were,</L>
<L>To take him from his steed full tenderly;</L>
<L>And eke the fairest Alma met him there</L>
<L>With balm, and wine, and costly spicerie,</L>
<L>To comfort him in his infirmitie:</L>
<L>Eftsoons she caus'd him up to be convey'd,</L>
<L>And of his arms despoiled easily;</L>
<L>In sumptuous bed she made him to be laid,</L>
<L>And all the while his wounds were dressing, by him staid.</L></Q>

<L>At times of chevisaunce and warlike geer,</L>
<L>And warrior knights who underneath their feet</L>

<L>Tho sagely would she change her talk, and ply</L>

<L>Ye would have sworn one of the heav'nly throng,</L>

<L>And eke <HI>Shamesacedness</HI> with mellow lute,</L>

<L>New wanted in well-doing comely pride.</L>

<L>Felt his spright mov'd past utterance, and figh'd;</L>

<L>It chaunced out one evening as these four</L>
<L>Did walk by thilke same river's winding side,</L>
<L>From whence Sir <HI>Guyon</HI> launch'd, which there did pour</L>
<L>His bounteous stream watering the country wide,</L>
<L>The <HI>Prince</HI> the coast which them opposed spied,</L>
<L>Woods and fair hills in beautiful array,</L>
<L>And lawns which now the setting Phoebus eyed,</L>
<L>Beaming the last remains of golden day,</L>
<L>He saw, and ask'd what land that was which yonder lay.</L>

<L>That is the land, the gentlest <HI>Alma</HI> said,</L>
<L>In which <HI>Apollo</HI> and the <HI>Muses</HI> dwell,</L>
<L>On which their blessings with great bountihed</L>

<L>Of <HI>Hippocrene</HI> they fix their happy sell;</L>
<L>There wonne at distaunce from the profane world,</L>
<L>With whose assairs they never mind to mell,</L>

<L>For bird and beast by <HI>Somnus</HI> are yblest;</L>

<L>To cruel slaughter on the helpless crew,</L>

<L>The <HI>Knight</HI> and <HI>Lady</HI> he with joy on board</L>

<L>And launch'd the vessel far into the ford:</L>
<L>Tho he his painted canvas did display,</L>
<L>While kind gales in its swelling bosom play,</L>
<L>With speed they cut the stream as chrystal clear,</L>
<L>Or as the bright-eyed Titan's piercing ray,</L>

<L>Two beings of most pleasing amenaunce;</L>

<L>To walk a moving plague among mankind,</L>
<L>Shun'd, hated, and refus'd the alms I crave,</L>
<L>The only thing I wish for not to find,</L>
<L>A still retirement in the peaceful grave:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In that fond hope to be deceiv'd, to hear</L>
<L>With soul yet conscious, in the church-yard way</L>
<L>The fierce invective cast upon my bier,</L>
<L>And Scornful Laughter dancing o'er my clay:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>
<L>All this, and more, I shall deserve to prove,</L>
<L>When led by changesul Fancy's wanton eye,</L>
<L>I turn a faithless truant to thy love,</L>
<L>And on the wings of vagrant Falsehood fly.</L>

<L>AH! whence, my Thespia, can that anguish flow,</L>
<L>That silent anguish of expressive woe?</L>
<L>That sigh which from thy struggling bosom stole?</L>
<L>That look which pierces to my inmost soul?</L>
<L>Ah! say, my Thespia, I conjure thee say,</L>
<L>To <HI>me</HI> the hidden cause thou <HI>mayst</HI> display:</L>
<L>Half of thyself, I claim my lawful share;</L>
<L>Yet would to Heaven that I the whole might bear!</L>
<L>Pour out thy thoughts in confidence to me;</L>
<L>Thou <HI>must</HI> not hide from <HI>me</HI> thy misery:</L>
<L>From thee would I my labouring heart confine?</L>
<L>And are not all its deepest secrets thine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wretch that I am! am I (who thee from pain</L>
<L>To shield, would pour out life at every vein),</L>
<L>Am I the cause? and couldst thou ever spy</L>
<L>A look of coldness glancing from my eye?</L>
<L>To thee a cold blank look? O too refin'd,</L>
<L>And subtile errour of thy feeling mind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>
<L>A delicacy apt too deep to dive,</L>
<L>To each nice touch too tenderly alive!</L>
<L>Though I esteem it as a blessing sent,</L>
<L>As the more polish'd mind's chief ornament,</L>
<L>A sacred spark kindled by Heaven's own ray,</L>
<L>Yet let not Sensibility betray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou weep'st; where did my tongue profanely rove?</L>
<L>How could I blame thee? 'twas excess of Love.</L>
<L>O let me circle thee with strict embrace,</L>
<L>Warm breast to breast, and glowing face to face,</L>
<L>(My fixed lips while speechless rapture ties),</L>
<L>Imbibe the lucid moisture of thine eyes,</L>
<L>Thy melting spirit in each breath inhale,</L>
<L>Gaze on thee till my cracking eye-strings fail,</L>
<L>And quite o'erpower'd by Love's imperious sway,</L>
<L>Feel all my fainting soul dissolve away.</L>

<L>WHAT have I done, what crime in me is found,</L>
<L>What secret evil lurking in my breast,</L>
<L>That while all Nature else is smiling round,</L>
<L>Heaven has on me its heaviest stroke impress'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Have I e'er dropp'd a wish of other's harm?</L>
<L>Or done an ill though ne'er to be reveal'd?</L>
<L>Have I not always breath'd th' emotion warm</L>
<L>On the chaste lip of Social Virtue seal'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! is it not enough that far away</L>
<L>From my own native happy fields I rove,</L>
<L>Far from each friendly name condemn'd to stray,</L>
<L>And torn by cruel force from her I love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But must through her the barbed steel be sent,</L>
<L>Which piercing, with severest torture wounds?</L>
<L>Must she I love convey the punishment</L>
<L>Which Justice' self must own exceeds its bounds?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On me rain all your woes, ye righteous Powers!</L>
<L>Though hard, I'll strive the misery to bear;</L>
<L>View Sickness steal away my lingering hours</L>
<L>On tainted wing, nor drop a pining tear:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="84" REF="88"/>
<L>But, ah! the gentle Virgin's tender frame—</L>
<L>O Bright-hair'd Chastity! O Angel Truth!</L>
<L>If ye are aught beyond an empty name,</L>
<L>Save, save in pity Innocence and Youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shield, shield me from the racking thought! I spy</L>
<L>From her cold cheeks the bland suffusion fled,</L>
<L>Dead is the piercing magick of her eye,</L>
<L>The lustre-darting beam of sense is dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She calls on me.—Oh, snatch the last embrace!</L>
<L>Woods, rivers, mountains, countries intervene;</L>
<L>Oh curse of curses! ne'er that lovely face</L>
<L>Again shall I behold; e'en the last scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some dreary satisfaction might afford,</L>
<L>Some solace to the madness of Despair,</L>
<L>Gloating in secret on his gloomy hoard,</L>
<L>With eye intorted viewing what is there.</L>
