<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. HARLEY.</STAGE>
<L>LONG has been serv'd from this our motley Stage,</L>
<L>Repasts for various tastes—from youth to age—</L>
<L>To lively Miss, escap'd from Sshool and toil,</L>
<L>Our sports have oft bestow'd the infant smile,</L>
<L>While the rude boy, from Westminster or Eton,</L>
<L>Who <HI>"spies,"</HI> and <HI>"quizzes"</HI> one, where'er they meet one.</L>
<L>For them, our brilliant Ballets drawn from Greece,</L>
<L>Restore their Greek—without a rod a piece.</L>
<L>While tricks and tumbling honest John employ,</L>
<L>Who drinks his punch aloft, and screams with joy.</L>
<L>The wife is all for music, shakes and thrilling,</L>
<L>Old maids, from soft humanity, love killing:</L>
<L>Each has his taste: for married life may say,</L>
<L>Not oft' two persons think in the same way.</L>
<L>Our Bard, long known to you, this night makes up,</L>
<L>Of various beverage—a kind of <HI>cup;</HI></L>
<L>Of Music, Pantomime, and graver scenes,</L>
<L>Perhaps a dash of terror intervenes;</L>
<L>Should not all these sufficient change supply,</L>
<L>If you condemn—there will be—<HI>Tragedy.</HI></L>
<L>But, Britons, while a neighbouring nation's crimes,</L>
<L>Have spread war wide, and made these—"Iron Times."</L>
<L>Greet <HI>you,</HI> the moral virtues of <HI>the STAGE,</HI></L>
<L>Which haply may amend an erring age:</L>
<L>That Arts and Sciences may take their place,</L>
<L>That the domestic ties may have their grace,</L>
<L>The rights of sweet humanity be known,</L>
<L>And freedom fixed by law, reign like your own?</L>

<STAGE>As they go off calls after them.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Holloa! Damsels! Stop a little, and I'll ease you of your wares, I'll warrant you. Well, thank Heaven, we're arrived in a chearful country at last. <STAGE>looking about</STAGE> Bless me! What a charming air! And what a charming appetite it gives one! I have scarcely swallowed any thing but dust for these three weeks, but here ends our tedious journey—Yonder is the city of Messina, and hard by resides the man my master is in search of—Why my master has left Savoy, to seek this interview with poor dead Julia's jealous husband, I am yet to learn—Oh! Here he comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>CARLOS.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>—At length, Valoury, the hurry of travelling is over—you now will have time to re∣cover your fatigue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Signor Carlos, and to lose my appetite I hope; for the one is as irksome a com∣panion as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would my distrestes could be as easily removed as yours—The shade of my departed Julia haunts me at every turn, and her injured memory calls aloud for vengeance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Sir, if grief or resentment could restore her to life, I'd starve myself into a passion with pleasure; but as that is impossible, might I advise you, Signor, I should recommend a tem∣perate meal or two, before we proceed any fur∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Temperate! Valoury, can anguish in∣supportable be temperate! Listen to the story of my heart—That Julia, the hapless wife of the im∣perious Count Montoni, whom thou saw'st interr'd at Palermo—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a melancholy sight it was, Sig∣nor Carlos—I remember I was just sitting down to an excellent barbacue, smoking hot, when the procession passed the window; but so it is, when∣ever a man is upon the point of being happy, some cursed thing or other always interferes to chill his prospects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think, Valoury, of an attachment begun almost in childhood, and improved with growing years; when love's soft wishes were sanc∣tioned by reason, and dear expectation nourished by consenting friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then was the cause of your los∣ing her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her father's avarice and ambition. This proud, indignant Lord, the Count Montoni, with large possessions, and extended power, was
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
captivated with my Julia's blooming charms, and, do I live to repeat it, tore her from me in the mo∣ment when she was to have been mine for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came the Lady to consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>There thou hast touched the cord of anguish in my breast; <HI>that</HI> drove me from my native home, to seek in solitude a calm, which, alas, Valoury, thy master's heart can never more experience; <HI>that</HI> brings me back again on the wings of rage, and vengeance, to demand atone∣ment for wrongs too great to be endured.</P>
<STAGE>With great energy.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, Sir! Has any thing hap∣pened lately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; from the amiable Constantia, the only surviving sister of my hapless love, I learn by papers found since her decease, that the most infernal arts were put in practice by the Count and his adherents, to bend the timid fair one to their cruel purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on me! My hair stands on end. They hinted too at Palermo, that the Lady's death was sudden and extraordinary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>By basest forgery she was induced to believe I had already been wedded to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>To another indeed! As if Gentlemen of your prudent turn of mind, did not think one wife at a time quite sufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the hour of retribution is at hand; meanwhile bear this letter to Constantia—Her father, old Fractioso, is one of the Chief Magi∣strates in the city. I would on no account that he should hear of my return; therefore be careful to deliver it into her own hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trust it to me, Signor, and Dad shall know no more of the business, than an Ex-Mini∣ster does of the Cabinet, or a fashionable husband of his wife's bed-chamber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>From her you may learn tidings of my friend, Hilario, whose return from Germany I ex∣pect about this time; and I know, notwithstand∣ing her father's obstinate prohibition, Constantia is not insensible to his deserts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a charming Gentleman he is; would he were here—his chearfulness would drive away your honour's melancholy—sorrow with him, is like a bad Signet, it squeezes the surface; but leaves no impression.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Sound of horns.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark! Here come the Falconers with their Hawks—we must not be seen, retire—be expeditious, and meet me at the Hotel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the Hotel—ah! Sir, you need not doubt my expedition; for sure no love sick girl in Europe can be more sharp set than is your honor's very hungry, humble servant.</P>
</SP>

<L>Heighlo! Heighlo! The morning is up,</L>
<L>And the gallant Falconers abroad;</L>
<L>We've each of us had a stirrupping cup,</L>
<L>And of game we'll bring home a load—</L>
<L>Uncouple the Spaniels, and let the dogs try,</L>
<L>See the Partridge there on the wing;</L>
<L>Quick, quick! Jolly Falconer, let the hawks fly,</L>
<L>'Tis a pleasure fit for a king.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>Then mark the swift Hawk—see him now make his stoop,</L>

<L>Barons of old, and Princes so high,</L>
<L>Loved Hawking as their lives;</L>
<L>The health of the field, and the Falconer's cry,</L>

<L>Our Hawks, they are a Gallantie show,</L>

<L>The Falconer laughs at sports below,</L>

<STAGE>Enter <HI>COUNT MONTONI.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Montauban, draw near; thy activity and diligence are commendable—are the Hawks strong and eager?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Lord—no doubt we shall have sport.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks I shall not sport to-day—dis∣miss thy followers awhile—I would confer with thee in private.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>The train go off.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall your vassal repay this condescension?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou know'st Annette, I think, Con∣stantia's woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>And toy'st with her occasionally?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>The damsel has charms, and I admire them, nothing more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean to chide thee, gentle Montauban, nor thwart thy amorous pursuits— they may, perchance, enable thee to do me service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Let me fly to execute your commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, thus it is. I have reason to sus∣pect that Constantia holds secret correspondence with Carlos, my avowed, and mortal foe; the man who in life's childish, thoughtless hour, stole my wife's affections; for whose sake she shun'd my embraces, and notwithstanding her father forced her to be mine, with-held from me a husband's lawful rights, and died the sullen vestal she had lived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>You astonish me, my Lord—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exert thy influence with this forward waiting woman; caress, cajole, do any thing thou canst to discover, if possible, these dark proceed∣ings; for know, thy master's peace, his fame, his honor, nay, his life, may be at stake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forbid it Heaven!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hast thou seen Bernardo, my trusty Steward lately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not these two days as I think—he seemed wrapt up in thought, and deeply pensive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he so? I do not wonder at it; for indeed, I dread his presence. <STAGE>aside</STAGE> He has done me signal service, and I mean, as suits my charac∣ter and station, to give him due reward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship's ever bountiful and good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought to have met him here—he will not be tardy to attend—I tremble at the inter∣view—yet how avoid it—it shall be so <STAGE>aside</STAGE>, tho' Bernardo is deserving of my warmest gratitude,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
yet the load of obligation bears so hard upon my nature, I cannot, will not see him face to face, till opportunity afford him ample recompence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Montauban.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such ever is the case with noble minds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do thou go forward—meet him on the way—give him this ring, as earnest of my friend∣ship—tell him we shall meet anon—meanwhile he'll rest assured, my favour shall go hand in hand with his desert to latest life—haste thee, good Montauban.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit Montauban.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>alone</STAGE>
<P>Right glad I am this meeting is awhile delay'd; for tho' I have gone too far to recede, tho' injured pride, and wounded honor, demand from the offender due expiation; and though I am certain Bernardo has used every pre∣caution to secure us from discovery, yet such are the weak workings of my mind, there is a some∣thing which I cannot shake off, that makes me shudder at the thought of seeing him.</P>
<STAGE>Going.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>CARLOS.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Count Montoni, if I thus intrude upon your privacy, and dare to interrupt your progress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! My detested rival. <STAGE>aside</STAGE> I see you dare invade the privilege of decorum, and in∣trude upon me like a lawless robber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spare your opprobrious epithet—it re∣coils upon yourself—who wa'st that robb'd me of my heart's best joy? The lov'd companion of my early years—the allotted partner of my future life? Who was't that basely practised on a timid female, and in conjunction with a sordid parent, led her
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
to pronounce unwilling vows, and meanly triumphed o'er a forced consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>I scorn your imputation, and despise your vanity; thus idle coxcombs, when their schemes are baffled, and the light froth that flat∣ters giddy girls, are in more ripen'd years seen through and slighted, they know not how to bear their humbled pride, but fly to falsehood and abuse for shelter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Infamous evasion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go—learn to check this habit of con∣ceit; learn to endure the freaks of female minds; and condescend to think, the gallant Carlos, tho' in the zenith of his youth's career, may some∣times suffer from a jilting mistress, while men, with less desert, may prove more fortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your levity, Count Montoni, is con∣temptible, and your insinuation ungenerous as unjust—did I not, soon as I heard the gentle maid had yielded to your solicitation, and, as I then thought, from worldly motives, abandoned the heart she once had deigned to prize; did I not tear myself from my friends, my family, my home, quit the fond scenes where I had been so blest, and with a bosom bleeding at every pore, leave you to the uninterrupted enjoyment of your nuptial happiness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then return to brave me unpro∣voked, and interrupt domestic grief? My wife is now no more; you can no longer plume your∣self upon her favour, or attack the sacred honor of a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven grant me patience! Must I then repeat the wrongs thou hast done me, and sting thy hardened bosom with reproach?</P>
</SP>

<P>Not so soon, my Lord! I came hither by your own appointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>True; I sent a message to thee, by Montauban, but no matter—this rencontre has determined me—we have no time to lose—I had some compunction; but now rage and jealousy resume their sway.</P>

<P>O lud! O lud! Noa. No∣body lives there but the rooks and ravens. To be sure they ha'had some visitors lately, and by their cawing and croaking, I dont think they much like their company.</P>

<P>Shrieking and squeaking! Hadn't we better get more assistance, Carlos?</P>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE> An old room, hung with antique, tattered tape∣stry—two doors exactly alike in the back scene, covered with the same tapestry—A window over them, the stage to be a little darken'd.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter the <HI>COUNT,</HI> muffled in a cloak, and <HI>BER∣NARDO.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>At length, my friend, the hour of retri∣bution comes; and love insulted, claims its sacri∣fice—the time, the place, occasion—all conspire, while secrecy secures revenge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bernardo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I could say ought to stay your purpose!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! 'tis now too late—Is not this favour'd rival come to vaunt his valour? Shall we restore the idol of his panting heart, and be ourselves, the victims of his triumph?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bernardo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never my lord—her destiny is fix'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, spite of the rage which fires an injur'd husband's breast, resisted pity will at times intrude—fear too, appals, and dread remorse— the very figures fashion'd in these antient hang∣ings, with ghastly eye-ball seem to frown upon us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bernardo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Weak imagery of the brain, which quick decision must efface—trust me, my Lord, we have little leisure to deliberate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>What mean'st thou, Bernardo?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bernardo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not an hour ago, waiting, as is my duty, for your Lordship's presence; a deep ton'd
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
bell, fixed unknown to me, in the interior of the Castle, was on a sudden by our mourner sounded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bernardo.</SPEAKER>
<P>At first I thought 'twas fancy; but being repeated, I flew to trace the cause, and in∣stant cut the rope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Soon after, the outward gates were by rude hands attempted to be forced.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou alarm'st me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bernardo.</SPEAKER>
<P>With speed I mounted to the turret, and descried some strangers in close conference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Didst thou know them?</P>

<SPEAKER>Bernardo.</SPEAKER>
<P>The day declining, prevented more discovery—The sportsmen returning from the field forced them to retire.</P>

<STAGE>agitated</STAGE>
<P>So ready, Bernardo—Yet, wherefore delay—danger may follow—bring hither the crow, the fatal dagger too—I left it in the portal, my hand refuses—can I be the assassin? Stay awhile—yet no—begone—fly—give not hor∣rid thought a moment's pause.</P>

<P>The night advances fast— wherefore this inward pang, this struggle of na∣ture? Come, wounded pride, love slighted, scorn∣ed—come suffering honour, aid this weak heart,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>In truth, Hilario, it is somewhat sur∣prising, after the extraordinary occurrences with∣out the walls of this old castle, we should as yet be able to make no discoveries within; a solemn silence seems to reign around, and nothing, save the hollow murmur of the wind, strikes on the listening ear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>A murmur of another kind, struck upon my ear.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>What mean you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear—but come a little further from that cursed cavern; you know, after having trampt about these diabolical apartments for half an hour together, we agreed to separate at the end of a long gallery, and took different routs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>We did so—and the distant glimmer of light from this lanthorn, which I found standing on the pavement, led me to the dismal recess where we again met—but proceed—</P>

<P>Will you be serious one moment?</P>

<P>Torture me not with suspense—but tell me all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I will, if I can find breath to go thro' with it—first I descended several steps of a dark narrow passage—at the bottom I heard a door open, then the patting of a man's foot, whether cloven or not I can't say—soon after, I saw a light, so I made a pause, and said to myself now dont be frightened, Hilario—now dont trem∣ble, my dear fellow, but summon up all your courage, and boldly run away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I had been there instead of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you had, with all my heart! tho' I defy you to run faster—but in the attempt, I fell plump on my face, and in scrambling to get up, I clawed hold of this broken bit of a shield. There seems something like letters scratch'd upon it.</P>

<P>You know, Signor, that your daugh∣ter Julia went to Palermo, at your own request, for change of air; it was not then in my power to attend her—news was brought to us of her de∣cease, and funeral honours followed in due course this you are acquainted with—but you know not perhaps, that Carlos's servant, if not himself, was discovered prying about during the solemnity.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>

<P>Spare yourself the trouble, Ma'am— I have done my duty as becomes the future son-in-law to a grandee—life's an eternal see-saw—now I am a poor galley slave—in a month, perhaps, I may make a cockswain—in another, captain of a squadron, and in a third, Vice Legate, Proetor, Viguier, Nuncio, Rota, Scrota, and so forth.</P>

<P>Dear, dear, how my poor young lady will take on—she was so eager to see her sis∣ter again, and so anxious to find her lover again, that she prevailed on Valoury, Carlos' servant, late as it was, to endeavour to hire a boat—and I shou'dn't be at all surprized if she was to cross the bay to the castle this very night—hist! isn't that music on the water.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE I</HEAD>
<STAGE>—The ramparts of <HI>MESSINA,</HI> with a view of the quay and harbour, where a vessel is seen at anchor, with sails bent—on one side near the front, the gates of the city, with a centry box.</STAGE>
<STAGE>The <HI>CENTINEL</HI> discovered on duty—A porter passes towards the quay, with a large chest.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Centinel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad! its a raw morning—I wish they'd come and relieve guard—there goes ano∣ther heavy load—I have seen old Signor Fractio∣so's servants busied these two hours, in conveying things on board that vessel—I wonder what it can mean? But its no affair of mine—when the old begin to move off, there's more room for the young to move on, that's my comfort.</P>

<P>Stay, my sweet—my dear comrades; don't leave me here in the cold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serjeant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace, you ungrateful varlet—was'nt it at your own request, and thro' the interest of good Montauban, that your punishment of being a galley-slave for life, was remitted, on condition of your serving as a soldier? and now would you still grumble?</P>

<P>Now don't I cut a pretty figure, whiskered up to the eyes like a turk, and loaded with arms like a baggage waggon—If I stay, I shall be flogged for not knowing my duty. Suppose I run away—no, I'll be <HI>shot</HI> if I do—I know the worst on't—to submit like my betters in office, to be cut up a little—here's an habita∣tion for the future son-in-law to a Grandee! no furniture—no state apartments! <STAGE>examines centry box.</STAGE> However, here's a good lock and key to the premises, and they pay no taxes—but shall I never see my brave friend, Carlos again, nor embrace my divine Constantia?—no—no more salutes for me, but with a drawn sword, or a musquet—ah! poor, poor Hilario!</P>

<P>So, so, there's the ship I see—all ready to sail—ay, ay, I knew as how there was some in∣famous poaching going forward—but I'll expose the old curmudgeon—I'll fetch sister, and setten her on—she'll cackle—I know she will—for no man shall take bread out o'my mouth—no man in all Sicily shall poach but myself, if I can help it— <STAGE>going comes against Hilario.</STAGE> ah, Centinel! how do you do?</P>

<STAGE>Echoing</STAGE>
<P>Yes, you have no hand in it, and therefore tries to prevent it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rota, Scrota, and so forth. I know him—well, what is he going to do with that vessel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cloddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you—he has gotten a house in the remote part of the country, among the moun∣tains on the sea-coast—and he is going to take his daughter there, and all his plate, and his jewels, and every thing he can carry away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can be his motive for that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cloddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they says he don't like the Count Montoni, her husband, as well as he was used, and they have had words together, and I suppose he thinks, if he doesn't secure the property himself, the Count will do it for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>Likely enough—but hasn't he another daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cloddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but she has no husband to make any claims, and to take care that she never shall, he has sent her to a convent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a convent, has he?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that he is—I know him as well as I do myself—but see here's the old man coming.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cloddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>There he is, an old rogue—leading his daughter to be banished—od rabbit it—sister can know nothing of this flight;—I doubt she ha' been off her listening, or she'd raise the whole city with her clack—how a' name o'fortune has he made Madam Julia consent to go? But she's a sweet lady, that's the truth on't, and as tractable as a staunch pointer.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cant you contrive to assist the lady? I dare say you're full as clever as you're honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cloddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you what, centinel—I wou'd do any thing to serve her, because why, when I acci∣dentally tumbled down once, and killed a large co∣vey of partridges, she interfered with her father, and saved me from a dangerous sore-throat <STAGE>shews his meaning with his hand</STAGE> oh, you old hard heart∣ed bit of justice!</P>

<P>It don't signify talking—you must go and you shall go—and I will have you go—I tell you again, between the mad Count, and the cun∣ning Carlos, I don't think my life is worth a year's purchase.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had Carlos been so inconsiderate, as to entertain improper hopes, the letter you have just now obliged me to write to him, must have extin∣guished them all—Oh Sir! why did I write but to oblige my father—where do I wish to live and die, but under his protecting roof? Let me not how∣ever, be torn from my loved sister, the partner of

my infancy, the only companion of my happy days, I ever now can cherish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fractioso.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your sister is safe enough in a clois∣ter—she has no husband to frighten her poor fa∣ther—don't you remember how fierce the Count look'd, at our last interview! he knit his brows and said "Ough! I will have my wife"—then you cried—" no——no" then he replied, "blood and oons! I will have her dowry" then I too, cried "no no"—so, I'm determined to hide both you and the property, where they will be safe from a furious husband, and an artful lover.</P>

<P>E'en this I cou'd have borne, Hilario, had your friend's dying moments witnessed my un∣shaken constancy, and ever growing love—but to suppose me base, perfidious—with his last breath perhaps to curse—Oh! 'tis too much, I can't sup∣port it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fractioso.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you I know every thing; and I know what it is to be locked up in a cupboard. First, I say I have got proofs—proofs about the story of that infernal Castle—So, expect a reward for your conduct, you treacherous Quartetto <STAGE>To Hilario, Julia, Carlos and Valoury</STAGE> What do you deserve hah? you, Mr. Justice on your side, will you have any more partridges? answer me— no, don't—for I wont be interrupted.</P>

<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>to Constantia</STAGE>
<P>Alas! my heart right∣ly foreboded some new calamity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fractoiso.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be quiet—I say I have proofs— damn'd proofs—I have seen my sweet son-in-law, that was—heard Bernardo confront him—I have taxed him myself, and by my famous cross-exa∣mining talents I have drawn out the whole truth. The Count is no more married to my daughter than he is to me—the ceremony was a base de∣ception upon us all—he had got another wife be∣fore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>Huzza! and I suppose he has as many castles, as wives to conceal them in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fractioso.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will nobody stop that fellow's mouth? I tell you I have delivered him over to the hands of justice, and Julia is her own mistress again, and free to do every thing that shall command.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Annette.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very great indulgence indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fractioso.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and therefore I command her on pain of a nunnery to give her hand—to Car∣los;

<SPEAKER>Fractioso.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't inturrupt me—while I have breath to speak, let me go on—and that I may get rid of both my daughters, my two plagues at once—come here you imp of mischief—take Constantia with a very small dowry—just to keep you cool and comfortable—arn't you a pretty fellow with your Rota, Scrota, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hilario.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I believe I am—I always said I shou'd be son-in-law to a grandee at last—My dear Constantia's silence gives me room to speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fractioso.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and your dear Constantia's tongue will keep your's silent, if possible, when you're married—I never knew any of the sex that fail'd—Annette, doesn't that put you in mind of your old grandmother too? Zounds! here are the natives coming down upon us —we'll let them partake of our joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Words are inadequate to speak my feel∣ings. Raised from the depth of woe, to the highest pinnacle of human happiness, I scarce be∣lieve the wonderful transition.—A short time past, my heart was fettered, and every sentiment of nature shrunk from action—now all the energies of life spring forth anew, and duty, love, and friendship, rush upon me—Oh! may each varied character be well sustained, that in the partial bosoms of approving friends, my future conduct may invite affection, and secure esteem.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. MATTOCKS.</STAGE>
<L>LOVE'S influence drawn from scenes of former years,</L>
<L>Why not pourtray it as it now appears.</L>
<L>Annette no more—the Italian confidante,</L>
<L>Suppose me now an old French gouvernante,</L>
<L>With coaxing cringe my pupil's heart to charm,</L>
<L>Discoursing fond and freely—arm in arm.</L>
<L>She in the bloom of life, and height of taste,</L>
<L>A yard of feather, and an inch of waist;</L>
<L>Waist did I say? I meant to mend my phrase,</L>
<L>The spot which was the summit of the stays;</L>
<L>"Young Charles," she sighs—no—the old Peer, his brother,</L>
<L>"I love the one—then, marry with the other—</L>
<L>"His withered hands, so terrible to touch,</L>
<L>"But then the Coronet upon his crutch—</L>
<L>"Delightful thought! That puts an end to sorrow,</L>
<L>"I'll have him, if papa consent, to-morrowi</L>
<L>What glomwing love must spring from such a channel!</L>
<L>They can't be cold, who're always wrap'd in flannel.</L>
<L>Turn we to courtship in a different strain:</L>
<L>An ancient Venus, and a youthful swain.</L>
<L>The Fair, if won, a mine of wealth would prove,</L>
<L>The hero, poor in every thing but love,</L>
<L>A crumplin she, head shrunk between her shoulders,</L>
<L>Mount on her back, attracting all beholders;</L>
<L>With Koscius<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o cap, and zone to bind,</L>
<L>The neck before, the prominence behind,</L>
<L>Her tiny person, and her cumb'rous pack</L>
<L>Look like a drum girt round a drummer's back—</L>
<L>The six foot stripling, firm in every joint,</L>
<L>Whose button'd trowsers brush the elbows point,</L>
<L><PB REF="92"/>Whose muslin foldings all his chin enclose,</L>
<L>Meeting the pondrous hat that veils his nose;</L>
<L>With mouth scarce visible, you'd think our beau,</L>
<L>The man in armour at my Lord Mayor's show</L>
<L>"Marry me, ma'am, he cries, and take your swing,</L>
<L>"Dam'me, I love you dearly—that's the thing:</L>
<L>"Who can such charming accents disapprove?</L>
<L>"My heart's too tender—I was form'd for love—</L>
<L>The little Lady all on tiptoe stands—</L>
<L>He stoops—she springs—and so they join their hands.</L>
<L>If such of modern love the blissful state,</L>
<L>Who would not choose the love that's out of date?</L>
<L>Some bright exceptions, still we trust then are,</L>
<L>Th' auspicious nuptials of the Royal Pair,</L>
<L>May bring old fashion'd feelings into vogue,</L>
<L>And shame the satire of our Epilogue,</L>
<L>Long may they live, with fond delight to prove,</L>
<L>Life's sweetest joys, flow from connubial love.</L>
