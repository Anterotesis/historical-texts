<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sick as a dog of being a valet!—running after other people's business and neglecting my own—this low life is the devil!—I've had a taste of the gentleman, and shall never lose it. 'Tis thy own fault, my little Mar∣tin.—Thou wou'd'st always play small games; when, had you but had the face to put yourself for∣ward a little, some well jointur'd widow had taken you into her post-chariot, and made your fortune at once. A fellow of my wit and spirit, shou'd have broke twice, and set up again by this time.</P>

<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend, happily met.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, I embrace you!—Not seeing you among the beau-monde, I was afraid there had been some fresh misunderstanding between you and the law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, my dear, I have had a narrow escape since I saw you. I had like to have been preferr'd in some of our settlements abroad—but I found there was no doing the business by deputy—so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not accept of the place, ha!—why, what little mischief had'st thou been at?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I don't know—meeting one night with a certain Portuguese Jew-merchant, in one of the back streets here by the Exchange—(I was a little in liquor I believe—piping hot from a turtle-feast) it came into my giddy head to stop him, out of mere curiosity to ask what news from Germany—nothing more—and the fellow, not understanding good Eng∣lish, wou'd needs have it that I ask'd him for some∣thing else.—He bawl'd out, up came the watch, down was I laid in the kennel, and then carried be∣fore a magistrate.—He clapp'd me on a stone doublet, that I cou'd not get off my back for two months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two months, say you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there I might have rotted, if I had not had great friends; a certain lady of quality's woman's cousin that was kept by Mr. Quirk, of Thavies-Inn, you must know, was in love with me, and she—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brought you in, Not Guilty, I warrant. Oh! great friends is a great matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>This affair really gave me some serious re∣flections.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, it spoil'd you for a news-monger: no more intelligence from foreign countries, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but, Martin, what's thy history since I saw thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Um!—a novel only, Sir: why, I am asham'd to say it; I am but an honorary rascal, as well as yourself.—I did try my luck indeed at Ep∣som,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
and Newmarket—but the knowing ones were taken in, and I was oblig'd to return to service again.—But a master without money, implies a servant without wages; I am not in love with my condition, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am with mine, I assure you: I am retir'd from the great world,—that's my taste now—and live in the country, with one Mr Harlowe—piping hot from his travels—'Tis a charming young fellow! Drinking, hunting, and wenching, my boy!—a man of universal knowledge. Then I am his privy counsellor, and we always play the devil toge∣ther.—That amuses one, you know, and keeps one out of mischief.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, pretty lambs! But what makes you at London now? whither are you bound?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>To yonder great house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Mr. Stockwell's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same. You must know his daughter is engaged to my master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Stockwell, to your master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis not above six weeks ago, that my mas∣ter's father, Sir Harry Harlowe, was here upon a vi∣sit to his old friend, and then the matter was settled between 'em,—quite a-la-mode, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>The old folk struck the bargain, without the consent of the young ones, or even their seeing one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tip top, I assure you; and ev'ry thing's agreed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sign'd and seal'd by the two fathers; the lady, and her fortune both ready to be deliver'd.—Twenty thousand, you rogue!—ready rhino down! and only wait for young master to write a receipt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whew!—Then my young master may e'en make a leg to his fortune, and set up his staff somewhere else.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy master!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, he's dying for the—twenty thousand—that's all;—but since your master— <STAGE>[going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! there you're safe enough, my master will never marry Miss Stockwell: there happens to be a small rub in the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>What rub?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only married already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, his father wou'd marry him here in town, it seems, and he—chose to be married in the country—that's all. The truth is, our young gentleman manag'd matters with the young lady so ill—or so well—that upon his father's return there was hot consulting among the relations; and the lady being of a good family, and having a smart, fighting fellow of a brother in the army—why, my matter, who hates quarrelling, spoke to the old gentleman, and the affair's hush'd up by a mar∣riage, that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Um! an entire new face of affairs!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>My master's wedding-cloaths, and mine, are all order'd for the country, and I am to follow them, as soon as I have seen the family here, and redeem'd my old master's promise, that lies in pawn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Old master's promise!—let me think—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas what brought me to town, or I had not shook my honest friend by the fist.—Martin, good morrow!—what, in the dumps?—we shall meet again man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me alone—I have a thought—hark you, my dear; is thy master known to old Stockwell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never saw him in his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's brave, my boy! <STAGE>[hits him a slap on the back.</STAGE></P>
<P>Art thou still a cock of the game, Slip? and shall we?—No: I doubt—I doubt that damn'd Jew-merchant sticks in thy stomach, and you are turn'd dunghill, you dog!</P>

<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slip.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk of disappearing with the lady's for¦tune, and never mention Slip in the treaty.</P>
</SP>

<P>Oh! we shall disappear together, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sure.—I have more honour than to go withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you.</P>

<P>Well, on that condition, I am content to pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your back hand.—But hold, hold!—how wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> you pass yourself for my master, in a family wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you are so well known?</P>
</SP>

<P>Hold your fool's tongue—this is my fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> visit to 'em.

<P>She'll think so, I believe.</P>

<P>You know, Jenny, that Belford has got into my heart, and if I consent to marry this man, 'twill be the death of me.—Advise me then, and don't be so teizing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lud! what advice can I give you? I have but two in the world; one is, to forget your lover, and t'other to disobey your father.—You have too much love to take the one, and I too much consci∣ence to give t'other;—so we are just where we were, madam.</P>

<P>I never was more in earnest, madam.—She loves flattery dearly; and she loves her daughter dearly; I'll warrant, with a sigh, and a tear, and a handkerchief, she makes her husband break his word with young Harlowe in a quarter of an hour after his arrival.</P>

<P>Nay, that's too much—I have my failings, and my virtues too, Jenny—in one thing in∣deed I am very unlike other women; I always hearken to reason.</P>

<P>I force my child's inclinations!—No, I make the case my own. But tell me, (there's a good girl) has my daughter an aversion to young Harelowe?</P>

<P>I Am surpriz'd that Martin has not return'd to tell me his success with Jenny—He ad∣vis'd me not to stir from home, and said I might be assur'd every thing goes well, and I should hear from him—But still the impatience of my heart cannot bear this delay—I must be near the field of battle, let what will be the consequence—I hope I shall get a sight of Martin, and not unluckily light on the old gentleman; 'sdeath! he's here!—O, no, 'tis Jenny, my heart was in my mouth.</P>

<P>But what? You hesitate, Jenny, and seem concern'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Concern'd! why, we're undone, that's all. Your rival is come to town.</P>

<P>Not while I'm alive, I can tell him that.—But, prithee, who is this happy rival of mine?</P>

<P>'Tis one Mr. Harlowe.</P>

<P>A gentleman of Dorsetshire.</P>

<P>Oh, you are very clever now, an't you? What wou'd you be at now?</P>

<P>Why, that this Harlowe is the son of Sir Harry Harlowe of Dorsetshire, and my friend, my particular friend.</P>

<P>Yes, and so particular, that he will take your mistress from you.</P>

<P>That the aforesaid John Harlowe, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> your particular friend, and son to Sir Harry Harlowe of Dorsetshire, is now within, waiting for my young lady's hand, that's all.</P>

<P>'Tis the luxury of the times, Sir;—though we are poor we have good tastes, and can be out of the way now and then, as well as our betters.</P>
