<HEAD>TO MRS. FRUSHARD, CALCUTTA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SELDOM write Dedications. Whenever I have written one, it has been from an impulse of veneration, or of tender grati∣tude. THE BELLE's STRATAGEM I de∣dicated to <HI>her Majesty</HI>; THE TOWN BEFORE YOU is dedicated to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>The virtues which you practise in your elegant pavilions at GASSARY, have
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
reach'd the British shores. Their reputa∣tion now echoes back again to those of the Ganges; and I would persuade myself that I may be the cause of extending it still farther. Yes, I would hope that this humble pen may speak to those of after times, and tell them that you <HI>quietly</HI> per∣form such acts of graceful goodness, as open a thousand mouths in your praise, whilst you persuade yourself that all is secret, and that no one finds you out to be more amiable and respected, than the generality of human creatures.</P>
<P>This self deception is a little help'd on, by him, to whom of all earthly beings you are bound to look up. He <HI>aids</HI> your charming impositions—he <HI>assists</HI> you in fixing fetters of gratitude on all around you, and then persuades himself and you, that Heaven alone is privy to the deed. But you could not hope always to go on
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
in this sort of concealment—at length you are unveil'd!</P>
<P>I am unable to measure the extent of my private obligations to you; but may this public acknowledgement of them con∣vince you that they throb in my heart, and that I must be</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Ever, MADAM, Your faithfully devoted, H. COWLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following is rather the Comedy which the Public have chosen it to be, than the Comedy which I intended. Some things have been left out, and some have been added since the first representation: In short, the Comedy has been <HI>new class'd</HI>—it has been torn from its genus.</P>
<P>It is hoped, however, that there may be found cha∣racters, in THE TOWN BEFORE YOU, to interest, and situations to attach; and that those events which were vivacity in the Theatre, will not be dulness in the closet.</P>
<P>But it must be noticed, that the scene, in the second act, between TIPPY and his Landlady, and that in the fifth act, between TIPPY and the Bailiff, were no part of my original design. They were written during the illness of MRS. POPE, after the Piece had been played several nights. Alas! I am sorry to remark, that no scenes in the Comedy (to use the Stage idiom) <HI>go off</HI> better.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="7"/>An acute Critic lately said, in one of those assemblies where conversation, though sometimes light, is seldom without meaning, "A Comedy to please, in the present day, must be <HI>made,</HI> not written." It requires no great expanse of comprehension to perceive the meaning of this dogma; the truth of which I am equally ready to acknowledge, and to deplore: But should it <HI>want</HI> illus∣tration, it may be found every week in a popular Piece, where a great Actor, holding a sword in his left hand, and making aukward pushes with it, charms the audience infinitely more than he could do, by all the wit and observation which the ingenious Author might have given him; and brings down such applauses, as the bewitching dialogue of CIBBER, and of FAR∣QUHAR pants for in vain!</P>
<P>The patient developement of character, the repeated touches which colour it up to Nature, and swell it into identity and existence (and which gave celebrity to CONGREVE), we have now no relish for. The com∣binations of interest, the strokes which are meant to reach the heart, we are equally incapable of tasting. LAUGH! LAUGH! LAUGH! is the demand: Not a word must be uttered that looks like instruction, or a sentence which ought to be remembered.</P>
<P>From a Stage, in such a state, it is time to with∣draw; but I call on my younger cotemporaries, I in∣voke the rising generation, to <HI>correct</HI> a taste which, to be gratified, demands neither genius or intellect;— which asks only a happy knack at inventing TRICK. I adjure them to restore to the Drama SENSE, OBSER∣VATION,
<PB N="xi" REF="8"/>
WIT, LESSON! and to teach our Writers to respect their own talents.</P>
<P>What mother can now lead her daughters to the great National School, THE THEATRE, in the confi∣dence of their receiving either polish or improvement? Should the luckless Bard stumble on a reflection, or a sentiment, the audience yawn, and wait for the next tumble from a chair, or a tripping up of the heels, to put them into attention. Surely I shall be forgiven for satirising myself; I have <HI>made</HI> such things, and I blush to have made them.</P>
<P>O! GENIUS of a polish'd age, descend!—plant thy banners in our Theatres, and bid ELEGANCE and FEEL∣ING take place of the <HI>droll</HI> and the <HI>laugh,</HI> which formerly were found only in the Booths of <HI>Bartlemy</HI> Fair, and were divided between <HI>Flocton</HI> and <HI>Yates!</HI> With actors capable of giving force to all that is intellectual, is it not <HI>pity</HI> to condemn them to such drudgery? THEY are no longer necessary. Let Sadler's Wells and the Circus empty themselves of their performers to furnish our Stage; the expence to Managers will be less, and their business will be carried on better. The UNDERSTANDING, DISCERNMENT, and EDUCATION, which distinguish our modern actors, are useless to them;—strong muscles are in greater repute, and grimace has more powerful attraction.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. MATTOCKS.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>AH! ah! you're here, and comfortably tight?</L>
<L>Well squeez'd and press'd, I see—from left to right.</L>
<L>Waiting the moment when the curtain rises,</L>
<L>Gasping for plots, adventures, and surprises!</L>
<L>Were I a Poet—a Dramatic Wit,</L>
<L>And by the Stage Tarantula were bit,</L>
<L>My Prologue shou'd, as was the good old way,</L>
<L>A word or two upon <HI>the subject say</HI>;</L>
<L>Hint a loose outline of the scene within,</L>
<L>And let you guess the whole ere we begin.</L>
<L>In present times, the Prologue and its Play,</L>
<L>Are as near kin as Michaelmas and May—</L>
<L>Confin'd, then, not to say a word of <HI>that,</HI></L>
<L>I'll tell a story—and I have one pat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Boniface of late, placed near his door,</L>
<L>"Good larders here, of genuine wines, rich store."</L>
<L>In gold the gaudy invitation hung,</L>
<L>And to the shifting Zephyrs gently swung.</L>
<L>It chanc'd a traveller, with stomach keen,</L>
<L>Leapt from his Rozinante, tir'd and lean,</L>
<L>'Talk'd of his supper, with an eager air—</L>
<L>Resolved, for once, in no expence to spare;</L>
<L>I'll have stewed carp, he cried, and chicken roast.</L>
<L>And, bring me, of the Burgundy you boast.</L>
<L>Y—e—s, Sir, the staring, curtfying Damsel said,</L>
<L>And, in a trice, the table-cloth was laid.</L>
<L>I am my own man, he adds, in accents bold,</L>
<L><PB REF="10"/>Nor shall I fear, to-night, my household scold;</L>
<L>One hundred miles, betwixt me and my dear—</L>
<L>Odds bobs! her shrill alarum can't reach here!</L>
<L>At length came back the pretty, simpering Kate,</L>
<L>And plac'd—two eggs upon his lonely plate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Traveller amazed, the Landlord call'd,</L>
<L>Host! Host! in angry accents loudly bawl'd;</L>
<L>He came—Where are your ducks, your lobsters, turkey, hare?</L>
<L>"Why, there you have them—<HI>in the Bill of Fare</HI>;</L>
<L>"There you have game, and fowl, and fish, well drest,</L>
<L>"And neat old Port, to give the whole a zest;</L>
<L>"My house affords no other, Sir, believe me,</L>
<L>"I scorns, I'm sure, to go for to deceive ye."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The guest fatigued, enraged, the Inn forsook,</L>
<L>And the road, slowly, to another took:</L>
<L>There, <HI>without</HI> promise, all was neat and clean,</L>
<L>His food was wholesome, and his room not mean.</L>
<L>So—not to raise high hopes, we cannot meet,</L>
<L>We trust this night's <HI>plain</HI> fare is fresh and sweet;</L>
<L>And shou'd you like the dressing, we invite ye,</L>
<L>To come as often as the dish delights ye;</L>
<L>A hearty welcome you will always find,</L>
<L>And to your wills, our Host, and House, resign'd.</L>

<P>HOW well those fellows wrote, those an∣tients! How finely they satirize the rich, and what respect they have for virtue in rags! My dear, I will translate the passage—off hand now, d'ye hear, off hand!
<STAGE>(rises and reads)</STAGE></P>
<P><Q>Poliarchus, the rich Athenian, wantoning in gluttony, looks with contempt on the poor Cassander: Cassander reposing on his bed of straw, thanks the Gods that he has health and virtue; and prays to be preserved from the misfortune of being rich, like Poliarchus, whose floors are stained with the wine of drunkenness, and whose silver couch is con∣stantly crowded by physicians.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you sure that is a just translation, Mr. Fancourt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Madam, do you doubt my knowledge of Greek! Some people can hardly read English at sight; I can translate at sight, thanks to the milk I suck'd in at Oxford. Doctor Johnson and I, were both Oxford men. —I like to read that old Quiz, he was so fond of us Oxford fellows. But he had too much respect for riches—he liked rich people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say truth, I have a little of his way of thinking. I had never much respect towards those Philosophers who are always throwing sarcasms on the rich—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(interrupting)</STAGE>
I do maintain, Ma∣dam, that the rich are <HI>the</HI> vilest—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Mr. Fancourt, your extravagancies have rendered you poor, and therefore you are always raving thus, and pouring your philipics on people of fortune;—as though vice and folly could only be found in palaces, and virtue in garrets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day! Why Ma'am—why—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I believe there is as much goodness amongst persons of fortune, as amongst the poor—and I do not see why the power of dressing elegantly, and living in well educated society, should debase the heart, or weaken the understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You</HI> do not see! why you are the greatest—the most abominable—upon my soul, you are the most provoking fool that ever—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Sir, I do not doubt it—you have repeated these opinions too often for me not to be convinced of their justice. But really now, between ourselves
<STAGE>(rising and laying down her work)</STAGE>
as opinion is nothing
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
without example, I will take the liberty to quote yourself in support of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! quote me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even your great and mighty self! Mr. Fancourt, when I married you, you were not poor—not so poor as you are now; and I think at that time you had no particular vices; but as dissipation has brought poverty upon you, I have observed that by little and little your shallow virtues have disappeared, till—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(impatiently)</STAGE>
'Till what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Till you are capable of al∣most any action that will not endanger your neck. Nay, I no longer mind your threaten∣ing looks—I am so convinced of what I have said, that my heart feels horror.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll make it feel something else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot. All <HI>other</HI> power over my heart is over; you can afflict it no more! But observe my deduction. I state you to yourself as a proof that poverty is <HI>sometimes</HI> the source of wickedness; and that squalid wretchedness is as capable of debasing the heart, as affluence and splendor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, woman! very well! still the noise of that child there—
<STAGE>(going to the door)</STAGE>
what an odious squaling it keeps!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not easy, Mr. Fancourt, to still the noise of children who are hungry. Though they are the children of the <HI>first</HI> Mrs. Fancourt, it pierces my heart to hear them— why will you not do something to get bread for them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you have me do? I was not bred to stand behind a counter, nor
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
to cry "<HI>Chairs to mend</HI>" in the streets. You know all that—what did you marry me for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! because I loved you. The sweetness of your manners disguised the emptiness of your heart, and I romantically thought that poverty could never be an evil, when two hearts fondly <HI>shared</HI> its difficulties. But now—permit me to ask, why you married me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because you had a modicum of a fortune—a score of hundreds: and I had not so many shillings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That little modicum might have been a bank, if properly managed, and—</P>
</SP>

<P>Pshaw!—stuff! I hate such cant. What do <HI>you</HI> want?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such abominable cant!
<STAGE>(untying the up parcel)</STAGE>
I am as tired of it as I used to be of my Grandmother's spelling through Hannah Glass's Art of Cookery, and I believe in my conscience —the devil! here is gold!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gold!</P>

<P>Keep off—you are too good, too pure, to want such vile trash. Twenty guineas by Jupiter—ah, ah!
<STAGE>(shaking the purse.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is a note dropt

<Q>Accept this purse, Sir, from one who is sorry to see such merit in confined circumstances, and who was charmed with your delicate manner of revealing it.</Q></P>

<PB REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Robert Floyer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>Sir</HI> Robert Floyer, a fine old Welchman, who got himself made Sheriff, then a Knight—those two dignities generally follow, like the Old Bailey and a whipping. I made the old blockhead believe that I was deeply versed in Welch antiquities—that Snowden was once a burning mountain, and that the <HI>Ap Morgans</HI> and <HI>Ap Shoneses</HI> were lineally descended from King Priam. You see I know how to turn my wits to account—I can make money, though I can't make shoes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and you see there is generosity where there is no poverty; and that but for the beneficence of a man of fortune, a <HI>rich</HI> man, your children to-day wou'd have wanted a dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! what merit is there in the generosity of a rich man! a fellow who takes out a handful of guineas from his store as you would dip a bucket into a well? give me the virtue of the poor man who divides his last shilling—his last two-pence with his friend; who takes his pint of porter from his thirsty lips, and shares it with his poorer neighbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, here is your <HI>poor</HI> sister —I will go and receive her—you can now assist her distresses—what pleasure it will give you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>None of your documents—if she is in distress, let her pawn her superfluities, as other poor people do.
<STAGE>(going out.)</STAGE>
There is some difference between sharing one's last two-pence with a friend, and one's last twenty guineas.

Dang et, I have delivered seventeen—all the way from Manchester-square to Petty France; from there to Bishopsgate-street after sweet∣meats for Miss, and then to the Hay-market about the pianny forty. Hang me if I doant make dead men of these
<STAGE>(tearing the notes);</STAGE>
dead men tell no tales. The people they were for, will never know their loss. I can say I found nobody at hoam; ha, ha, ha! that was amoast the first word I larn'd, when I come to Lunnun—"Not at hoam, Sir." Dad! the gentry here have the cheapest way of entertain∣ing their friends; it doesn't cost above a dozen or two lies a day to keep acquaintance with great quality. Hey! did you speak to me, Sir?</P>

<P>Well, I am glad I sent him those few guineas. Fancourt seems to be a lad of merit; and when he opened his distresses to me,

he did it in such a delicate, modest way! He is an excellent companion, and he has a pretty taste for antiquities—I like antiquities.</P>

<P>So I guess'd, Sir, by the vast quan∣tity of old worm-eaten furniture you have at home, which you never make any use of, but to shew to strangers. All from the old castles be∣longing to your forefathers, Sir, I take it?</P>

<SPEAKER>Humphrey.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the gemmen were debating. Yes—O! my ears! I heard a city debate, and they called one another Mr. Deputy—and one of them, with a fine red double chin, got up and said,
<Q>I am sorry to differ from Mr. Deputy
<STAGE>(speaking gruffly);</STAGE>
but I contend that these innovations bode no good to our con∣stitutions. The hour for dining, since my time, was two; it has been three, four, and six; and I suspect shortly it may be eight— hum! I move, therefore, that a petition be presented to the Lord Mayor—hum— hum—</Q></P>
<P>On which a little squinting gentleman rose, and said
<STAGE>(in a shrill quick voice),</STAGE>
<Q>I support the worthy Deputy who spoke last. These late hours are ruinous to the body cor∣porate. On Lord Mayor's Day we dined so late, that when I went afterwards to Fish∣monger's-hall to <HI>supper,</HI> the turbots were gone, nay, the second course was demolished, the sweetmeats were pocketed, and nothing remained but cheese and pickles.</Q></P>

<P>Yes; and I have left her with a person of much greater consequence—she is in deep consultation with her milliner. To a girl of eighteen, Sir Robert, a milliner is of as much importance as an aid-du-camp to a general. I knew my distance when she en∣tered, and immediately took leave—Pray, Sir, order my chair

<P>Ha, ha, ha! Think of Mr. Conway? That he has all the advantages which belong to fashion, without its vices. He has certainly some vanity, but more good sense. His friends are well chosen; he admires beauty; he loves goodness; and there <HI>is</HI> a young lady—

—Bless me, Lady Horatia, how cou'd you be at home to-night? I gal∣lopp'd sixty miles to-day, have kill'd one coach-horse, and spoiled another, merely to hear the Banti—O! the Banti!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blew his nose! very affecting in∣deed! and countesses are charming creatures. But, dear Georgina, the warmth of thy ima∣gination would disturb my peace, did not thy extreme giddiness prevent its fastening on any one object for more than ten minutes together. Hah! take care of thyself, my dear Georgina, thou art treading upon men-traps and spring∣guns. Thy paths, though seemingly covered with flowers, are full of thorns, prickles, and adders.</P>

<SPEAKER>Asgill.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you mentioned Lady Horatia; and the moment her idea is presented to me, every other is swallowed up. O! Conway, she engrosses my whole soul—to see her is bliss, and the sound of her voice is rapture.</P>

<P>Faith, I perceive no room for jests. I think it must be charming to see a fine wo∣man sit with a chissel, and bring out of a block of marble, a form as graceful as her own; every feature glowing with animation beneath

<P><STAGE>(smiling and catching his hand).</STAGE>
I thank you; but your eulogy is not compleat, for the purity of my Horatia chastises the art she loves.

Yes—no—I can not tell. She treats me with rigour, yet I think her heart has passion. I sometimes fancy I see it shine like the sun in November—unwillingly, and by starts.</P>

<SPEAKER>Conway.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you not lead to an ex∣planation.</P>

<P>I cannot; for she is rich, and I am as you know, dependent on the will of an Uncle.</P>

<P>Well. Pray for me, my dear Asgill, that I may catch my little Welch fawn; I have no prayers to make for <HI>you</HI>; for I perceive your's is one of those sober passions, that, end as it may, your mind will keep its equilibrium. O! how delightful it must be to love with so much good sense.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right—never neglect bu∣siness. O! I wish all the peers were like this peerless peer. Ay, there he goes into the Pa∣lace, I see. Mr. Fancourt, I am prodigiously obliged to you for making me known to his lordship. Is he a man of large fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but a little out at present. It is amazing what vast sums he has expended for the public. He was just asking me if I knew any honest man who could lend him a thousand pounds. He could have ten times that of the Jews—But he hates the Jews—O! he has never any dealings with the Jews.</P>
</SP>

<P>Perfectly right.</P>
</SP>

<P>O! I always say, my lord, what∣ever you do, borrow money of the Christians —always borrow of the Christians. He only wants it for a month, just till quarter-day.

Sir Robert, its an opportunity now—he has amazing interest—a single sentence, whilst he is swallowing a glass of Burgundy, would do your business.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Robert</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(in a passion).</STAGE>
Why, Sir, what do you mean? They never had such a friend; I spent more money to favour the cause than I care to own. I was for ever on horseback; there was not a cottager who could influence the sixteenth cousin of a voter, whom I did not en∣tertain; and the fact is, it was solely owing to me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, do you take me to be such a ninny as to plead your <HI>services.</HI> You are a mere chicken! Listen. I say, SNAPPER, we must have him on our side
<STAGE>(sips).</STAGE>
The old scoundrel killed his set of coach greys, and fifteen nags in riding about the country to oppose us

He is a great fool, but he is related to all the <HI>ap Morgans,</HI> and the <HI>ap Shoneses</HI> in three coun∣ties.
<PB N="28" REF="39"/>
In short, we must have him—so here goes— "the girl we love!" Thus, <HI>I</HI> swallow the girl, <HI>he</HI> swallows the hint, and the business is done. Will you lend me the thousand pounds?</P>

Does the music of the concert fascinate her? No. Does polish'd conversation interest her?

<P>But if you should not love <HI>me,</HI> I should die.</P>

<SPEAKER>Georgina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love! I wou'd not love for all the world. Miss Gwatkin was in love once, and she grew as pale as horse-radish. Foolish creature, if she had kept her colour, perhaps the Gentleman would have liked her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Conway.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! let me teach you to love; I see you are yet as ignorant of it, as—</P>

<P>As that fine Mr. Tippy was of sculpture, ha, ha! teach me to love; what, teach me to be wretched, to weep, to be sleep∣less, to lose my bloom. O! if I ever thought it possible that I could love you, I should hate you beyond all bearing—I would fly from you, and never see you more.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Affected</HI> pleasantry, Mr. Fan∣court, is the poor refuge of an uneasy heart. The conversation which has passed in the next room with Mr. Tippy, I have heard; and I fear you have an action in contemplation which will hereafter give you remorse.</P>

<P>Remorse, ha, ha, ha!</P>

<P>Pray do not think that every thing is to be carried off with a laugh.</P>

<P>Oh, exceedingly. Yes, I feel re∣morse very much, when in any of my—little —odd—excentricities, which you, in your vulgar dialect, call <HI>wickednesses,</HI> I cannot get the laugh on my side.</P>

<P>What, then, do the world really laugh at wickednesses?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fancourt.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! yes, always, my dear, always— when they do not suffer by it. A man will be

horridly mad if I cheat him of a thousand pounds; but if I swindle his neighbour out of it, he laughs, and says,

<P>Eighteen years; my nephew is ten years older. A happy age, Madam; the union of youth and manhood! Were I a lady I would never take a boy to guide me through life. Eight and twenty is <HI>the</HI> age, and that is the age of my nephew.</P>

<P>O! yes, he repeated that, as though it was a recommendation. You cannot think what a passion he went away in; for I vowed nothing on earth shou'd make me marry a beggar; and he took me all the while for you, ha, ha, ha!

O! I had forgot; the best of all is, he swears his Nephew shall marry a City beauty, with a great, large, clumsy City fortune.</P>

O! he had his regimentals on—aye—he is a Colonel in the Guards. Rather odd not speaking, I confess; but a man, whose head is stuff'd with the business of all Europe, must be forgiven if a slight acquaintance slips out of it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can make allowances, Mr. Fancourt; I remember myself, when I was High Sheriff for the county, I once passed an acqaintance, but I made him an apology; and, Sir, I shall expect an apology from my Lord, for not returning my bow, before I ad∣vance the thousand pounds. A thousand pounds is money, Mr. Fancourt.</P>

<P>It is—it is, Sir, and the man who will not make a bow for a thousand pounds, ought never to possess a thousand pence

He dines to-day at the Dutchess's in his own square; but I'll engage to bring him away in spite of wit, and beauty, and cham∣paigne.

<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish my Lord wou'd invite me to dine at a Dutchess's. I never did dine with a Dutchess. It must be very delightful! I should go back to Glamorganshire, and be able to amuse my neighbours with all her Grace's bons mots, and repeat her Grace's toasts; I would hold my ass-skin slily under the table, and pencil down her good things. 'Tis all the fashion now. Many a man gets a dinner by being known to write down the wit of his host or hostess; tho', after long watching, he frequently brings away empty tablets.

<SPEAKER>Asgill.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! 'tis in vain! never, Conway, will I sue for compassion from a proud beauty, who

treated me with haughtiness, even when she believed me heir to prosperity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Conway.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pride and loveliness ought to go together. I dislike the vulgar railing against the haughtiness of conscious beauty. She, who <HI>over</HI> values herself, will never sink too low; and the lady of whom we speak, perhaps loves you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asgill.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that very reason, I will not again appear before her. <HI>I</HI> am too proud to raise a conflict in her bosom between her pride, and her tenderness, and to owe at length, perhaps, to her <HI>compassion,</HI> the acceptance to which her love would never have acceded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Conway.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very nice. If my heart were not pre-occupied, and so fine a woman had an inclination to make me master of herself and for∣tune, I would not quarrel with her about the motive; I wou'd thank the pretty creature, and give her all the love I could.</P>

that I wish for the re∣putation of a bad heart. But the term, "<HI>Good kind of young man,</HI>" in our days, is so

applied, that I desire not to be honoured with it. An idle fellow, who hangs loose on so∣ciety, without merit or avocation, or one who corrupts the sister of his friend, or runs away with his daughter, or does all those things which mankind ought to execrate, is said, in excuse, to be <HI>a good kind of young man.</HI> In short, good kind of young man, in the pre∣sent acceptance, may very fairly be translated <HI>scoundrel.</HI></P>

<P>Sir Robert, I have often heard of the politeness of the Welch gentlemen, and you really confirm all that has been said. The year in which you were sheriff, Sir Robert, was such a year of splendour and magnificence, as Gla∣morganshire will long remember. We heard a vast deal of it at Saint James's; it amused the Royal Circle for a month.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my lord, I did my best on that occasion. When I was high sheriff for the county, I neither spared myself or my purse. A hanging in the morning, and an as∣sembly at night; giving the judges a dinner to-day, and to-morrow consulting Jack Ketch about a new gallows. Such a variety of busi∣ness, my lord, demands a man's whole atten∣tion.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Tippy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, certainly. A little thing happened this morning, Sir Robert, which has given me pain. You addressed me in the Park, I really was, at that moment, throwing over in my mind the compact between Russia and Po∣land. In short, I had almost determined to go to Saint Petersburgh, ambassador myself; for I think one or two points might be revised. At that very moment, Sir Robert, just as I was

Sir, it is false. You injure me in every part of your opinion. When he was rich, he never knew that he had caused a tender thought in me; it was only his poverty that made my passion break out with∣out disguise. It was his distress that made me feel, and acknowledge I adore him.</P>

<P>Well, then, receive my full confession. You, his second father! Mr. As∣gill has twined himself into my soul; his po∣verty has endeared him to me a thousand times.

<P>It was all a sagacious trick of

<P><STAGE>(<HI>in rapture</HI>).</STAGE>
Enough, enough— more than I hoped. On these terms I am con∣tent to bind my fate to yours. Such artless candour renders you enchanting.</P>

<SPEAKER>Georgina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then—but do not speak to my papa about it for whole week. Bless me— here's old Simon.

<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> SIMON, <HI>with</HI> ASGILL, <HI>in a sailor's dress.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, Madam, I have brought ye your sailor; and if you do not receive him with kindness, and welcome him back with your whole soul, you are no woman for me!</P>

<SPEAKER>Asgill</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>rushing to her feet</HI>).</STAGE>
Adored mistress of my heart! am I welcome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Horatia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Welcome! O, Asgill, there are characters so high, so noble, that to be chained in by common decorums, would be to have no taste for excellence, and my heart
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>
bounds with disdain from such frozen rules! I, who have hitherto treated you with coldness, almost bordering on disdain, now declare, in the presence of my friends, that I am proud to make you master of my fate; that I feel exalted in having it in my power to confer happiness on you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asgill</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>rising</HI>).</STAGE>
O! woman unequall'd!— Blessed be the hour in which you believed me poor and undone! Sir Simon has been feeding my soul with exstacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Horatia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Asgill, you must, indeed, love Sir Simon; but I know not how I shall set about doing so; he hates the arts; he thinks there is nothing dignified in sculpture; he hears, without veneration, the names of Phidias, and Michael Angelo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Madam, throw away your chisel and your marble blocks, and set about making a good wife. That ART is the noblest pride of an Englishwoman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Charlotte.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Horatia, you are all smiles! I declare I should not so easily have forgiven a man
<STAGE>(<HI>looking on Asgill</HI>)</STAGE>
who could fly from me to the boisterous ocean, and prove such insensibility to beauty and love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asgill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Misjudge me not! I, insensible to beauty, and to love! O! my glowing soul confesses their force, and adores their power. Yet the enthusiasm which seized me, when I trod the deck of the Victory, can never be chill'd! In the glorious tars around me, va∣lour, intrepidity, heroism, shone forth with all their fires; they flashed through my heart! And, I swear, that should my country need my assistance, I will again resume the trowsers,
<PB N="103" REF="114"/>
and sail before the mast, wherever she bids her cannon roar, or her proud pendants fly.
<STAGE>(<HI>Advancing forward</HI>)</STAGE>
Ah! repose on <HI>us!</HI> And when you look on the gallant spirits, who do honour to this habit, let every fear subside; for, whilst the sea flows, and English sailors are <HI>themselves,</HI> ENG∣LAND MUST BE THE MISTRESS OF THE GLOBE!</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, MISS WALLIS.</HEAD>
<L>THROUGH five long Acts—a pretty decent swing—</L>
<L>I've been a giddy, tender, harmless thing;</L>
<L>Light as a feather, in the morn of May,</L>
<L>Borne by the perfum'd breath of blue-eyed day.</L>
<L>Nor have I yet thrown by my <HI>studied</HI> part,</L>
<L>GEORGINA, still I am, in garb, and heart—</L>
<L>GEORGINA humbly stands again before ye,</L>
<L>Of gratitude so full!—she half adores ye.</L>
<L>It puzzles me to guess, when Conway's wife,</L>
<L>On what sweet plan to form my married life:</L>
<L>My heart beats high to think how I shall flash,</L>
<L>Pre-eminent, and bold, like Lady Dash.</L>
<L>Reflection ne'er to me shall be a damper,</L>
<L>My curricle I'll drive—on horseback scamper—</L>
<L>Keep Pharo Banks—take the long odds at races,</L>
<L>And know the knowing ones, in all their paces;</L>
<L>Lounge at Newmarket in the betting-rooms,</L>
<L>And prate to Lady Harriet—and my grooms.</L>
<L>But whilst I thus blaze on, in Folly's road,</L>
<L>And profligate, forsake my blest abode—</L>
<L>Where is my husband's peace?—his honour—where?</L>
<L>Who shall his lonely hours console, and share?</L>
<L>O! the black prospect scares my trembling art,</L>
<L>And from the headlong precipice I start.</L>
<L>Dear <HI>wedded happiness!</HI> my soul is thine,</L>
<L>My pride shall be, in thy mild paths to shine—</L>
<L>My CONWAY's temperate joys I'll make my own,</L>
<L>And <HI>his</HI> felicity my life shall crown;</L>
<L>With <HI>him</HI> through Pleasure's paths I'll sometimes roam,</L>
<L>But still my <HI>first enjoyment,</HI> shall be HOME.</L>
<L>The Household Gods ten thousand graces wear.</L>
<L>Nor stoop to borrow tinsel'd, <HI>foreign</HI> glare—</L>
<L>Yet never shall your Household Deities frown,</L>
<L>Though you should steal an hour, to see—THE TOWN!</L>
