<HEAD>TO BAMBER GASCOYNE, ESQ. <HI>RECEIVER GENERAL OF HIS MAJESTY's CUSTOMS, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following OPERA is inscribed to you, from two motives—Gratitude, and Self∣interest. My best feelings are indulged by this acknowledgment of the many obligations I owe to you—and my vanity, I confess, will derive no inconsiderable gratification, from the world being informed, that you have long classed me in the respectable list of your pri∣vate friends.</P>
<P>The scenes of <HI>dramatic fiction,</HI> are not per∣haps the best calculated, to display the sincerity of personal regard;—but my attachment is not the novelty of a day, and depends not there∣fore on the form of a public offering.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
The WOODMAN indeed, has, on this oc∣casion, some sylvan pretensions of his own: doing, "Suit, and Service," in that antient <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HAINAULT FOREST, in ESSEX.</NOTE>FOREST, over which you exercise a joint jurisdiction, he may be allowed, at least, a feudal claim to your protection: I should pay but an ill compliment to your classical taste, which I admire, to suppose he will be the less wel∣come, because he approaches you in the un∣affected garb of <HI>Pastoral Simplicity.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Dear Sir, With great Regard, Very faithfully your's, H. B. DUDLEY.</SIGNED>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>The following Statement, proceded the Book of <HI>SONGS,</HI> in the first Night's Representation; explanatory of the Writer's Views.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the OPERA of THE WOODMAN has been hastily put together, its defects will but too plainly point out. To excite the admired talents of a MUSICAL FRIEND, superseded every other consideration in this undertaking. In an endeavour to sketch his scenes from Nature, if the Writer has failed, the demerit must be entirely his own. In this case, he can only lament, that the genius of a great LYRIC COMPOSER should have been misguided by his inabi∣lity—but the pride of having first introduced the modest merit of Mr. SHIELD to the Theatrical World, he must still retain!</P>
<P>He was advised, to shelter himself under an assumed name, from some friendly apprehensions on the score of party pre∣judice; but this he thought unnecessary.—The decision of an English Audience, is seldom regulated by unworthy mo∣tives; and personal resentment is so invariably disclaimed by candid Criticism, that to deprecate it on the present oc∣casion, would degrade, even the humility of a DRAMATIC AUTHOR!</P>
<P><HI>To the friendly and liberal attention of</HI> Mr. HARRIS, <HI>and the zealous exertions of all the</HI> PERFORMERS, <HI>the</HI> AUTHOR <HI>feels himself much indebted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From a combination of the most effective powers of the Theatre, the</HI> WOODMAN <HI>derived, that correct, and animated Performance, which secured to the Piece so flattering a reception.</HI></P>

<P>Honest husbands to you both, for your kindness.—But now, Miss Emily, for the rest of your story, which you promised us a month ago.—Your aunt I remember well—and a fine straight woman she was in my younger days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, father—you'll pity poor Emily indeed, when you hear it;—she told it me last night; and I did nothing but sob and cry till day-light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I told you, that my widow'd mother was a tenant to old Mr. Wilford, in a small farm near the park—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAIRLOP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, child, you did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>At her decease I was taken, when very young, to be a companion to their noice, Miss Wilford, and shared with her, while she lived, an education—far beyond what my rank in life could entitle me to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>FAIRLOP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—and so.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Being the constant observer of her brother's increasing worth, my esteem for him insensibly grew with it; till at length I listen'd, too fondly, to his professions of re∣gard—which, probably, I ought to have discouraged!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAIRLOP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know how that should have been: but that's all over, child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! father, does not love always beget love, as I've heard my poor dear mother tell you a hundred, and a hundred times to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAIRLOP.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so thou hast, Dolly—but go on my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>In short, a mutual vow of inviolable affection was the consequence of this attachment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and that was right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Uncle, one moonlight evening—surprised us walking together on the terrace!—The next morning—to the astonishment of every one, he hurried my Wilford off to the continent, without his being able to bid me a last adieu!—and, by the most cruel vow, de∣clared, he would disinherit him if ever he beheld me more!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Barbarous creature!</P>
</SP>

<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>FAIRLOP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue a little—pray, Dolly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He enclosed me, a bill of a hundred pounds, the legacy bequeathed me by his Lady's will—and inform'd me, that I had his permission to remain at Wilford Lodge till I could otherwise accommodate myself—which I did the same day at my aunt's, in the adjoining parish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAIRLOP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I honor your spirit!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>After three years absence on his travels—during which time he has written to me in terms of unalter∣ed affection, I learnt, that Wilford was on his return to England.—To prevent, therefore, the fatal effects to him of even a supposed renewal of our attachment—I resolved—unknown to any one, to retire in search of an asylum, which, from my aunt's description of you, I flattered myself I might find—and, Heaven knows, have sound under your generous protection!</P>

<L>Can it beat to Mirth's gay measure,</L>
<L>All its strings attun'd to woe?</L>
<L>No! the mind by Hope forsaken,</L>
<L>But of Sorrow seeks relief:</L>
<L>Joy no transport can awaken,</L>
<L>Sighs must number out its grief.</L>
