<HEAD>To His Grace <HI>PHILIP,</HI> DUKE and MARQUIS of <HI>WHARTON,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has ever been the Custom of Poets to shelter Pro∣ductions of this Nature un∣der the Patronage of the brightest Men of their Time; and 'tis observ'd, that the Muses al∣ways met the kindest Reception from Persons of the greatest Merit. The World will do me Justice as to the Choice of my Patron, but will, I fear,
<PB REF="4"/>
blame my rash Attempt, in daring to Address Your Grace, and offer at a Work too difficult for our ablest Pens, <HI>viz.</HI> an Encomium on Your Grace: I have no Plea against such just Re∣flections, but the Disadvantage of E∣ducation, and the Privilege of my Sex.</P>
<P>If Your Grace discovers a Genius so surprising in this Dawn of Life, what must your riper Years produce? Your Grace has already been distinguish'd in a most peculiar Manner, being the first Young Nobleman that ever was admit∣ted into a House of Peers before he reached the Age of One and Twenty: But Your Grace's Judgment and Elo∣quence soon convinced that August Assembly, that the excelling Gifts of Nature ought not to be confin'd to Time. We hope the Example which <HI>Ireland</HI> has set, will shortly be followed by an <HI>English</HI> House of Lords, and Your Grace made a Member of that Body, to which You will be so Con∣spicuous an Ornament.</P>
<P>Your good Sense, and real Love for your Country, taught Your Grace to persevere in the Principles of your Glo∣rious
<PB REF="5"/>
Ancestors, by adhering to the Defender of our Religion and Laws: and the penetrating Wisdom of Your Royal Master, saw you merited your Honours ere he conferr'd them. It is one of the greatest Glories of a Mo∣narch, to distinguish where to bestow his Favours; and the World must do ours Justice, by owning Your Grace's Titles most deservedly worn.</P>
<P>It is with the greatest Pleasure ima∣ginable the Friends of Liberty see You pursuing the Steps of Your Noble Fa∣ther: Your Courteous, Affable Tem∣per, free from Pride and Ostentation, makes Your Name ador'd in the Coun∣try, and enables Your Grace to carry what Point You please. The late Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> will be still remember'd by every Lover of his Country, which ne∣ver felt a greater Shock than what his Death occasion'd: Their Grief had been inconsolable, if Heaven, out of its won∣ted Beneficence to this Favourite Isle, had not transmitted all his shining Qualities to you, and Phenix like, raised up one Patriot out of the Ashes of a∣nother.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
That Your Grace has a high Esteem for Learning, particularly appears by the large Progress you have made therein: and your Love for the Muses shews a Sweetness of Temper, and Ge∣nerous Humanity, peculiar to the Great∣ness of Your Soul; for such Virtues reign not in the Breast of every Man of Quality.</P>
<P>Defer no longer then, my Lord, to charm the World with the Beauty of your Numbers, and shew the Poet, as you have done the Orator; convince our unthinking <HI>Britous,</HI> by what vile Arts <HI>France</HI> lost her Liberty; and teach 'em to avoid their own Misfortunes, as well as to weep over <HI>Henry</HI> IV. who (if it were possible for him to know) would forgive the bold Assassin's Hand, for the Honour of having his Fall celebrated by Your Grace's Pen.</P>
<P>To be distinguish'd by Persons of Your Grace's Character, is not only the highest Ambition, but the greatest Re∣putation to an Author; and it is not the least of my Vanities, to have it known to the Publick I had Your Grace's Leave to prefix Your Name to this Comedy.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
I wish I were capable to cloath the following Scenes in such a Dress, as might be worthy to appear before Your Grace, and draw Your Attention as much as Your Grace's admirable Qua∣lifications do that of all Mankind; but the Muses, like most Females, are least liberal to their own Sex.</P>
<P>All I dare say in Favour of this Piece is, that the Plot is entirely New, and the Incidents wholly owing to my own In∣vention; not borrow'd from our own, or translated from the Works of any Foreign Poet; so that they have at least the Charm of Novelty to recommend 'em: If they are so lucky in some lei∣sure Hour to give Your Grace the Least Diversion, they will answer the utmost Ambition of, my Lord,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your GRACE's most Obedient, Most Devoted, and Most Humble Servant, SUSANNA CENT-LIVRE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>RROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a GENTLEMAN.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. THURMOND.</STAGE>
<L>TO-Night we come upon a bold Design,</L>
<L>To try to please without one borrow'd Line:</L>
<L>Our Plot is new, and regularly clear,</L>
<L>And not one single Tittle from <HI>Moliere:</HI></L>
<L>O'er bury'd Poets we with Caution tread,</L>
<L>And Parish Sextons leave to rob the Dead.</L>
<L>For you, bright <HI>British</HI> Fair, in hopes to charm ye,</L>
<L>We bring To-night a Lover from the Army:</L>
<L>You know the Soldiers have the strangest Arts,</L>
<L>Such a Proportion of prevailing Parts,</L>
<L>You'd think that they rid Post to Womens Hearts.</L>
<L>I wonder whence they draw their bold Pretence;</L>
<L>We do not chuse them sure for our Defence:</L>
<L>That Plea is both impolitick and wrong,</L>
<L>And only suits such Dames as want a Tongue.</L>
<L>Is it their Eloquence and fine Address?</L>
<L>The Softness of their Language?—Nothing less.</L>
<L>Is it their Courage, that they bravely dare</L>
<L>To storm the Sex at once?—Egad, 'tis there:</L>
<L><PB REF="9"/>They act by us as in the rough Campaign,</L>
<L>Unmindful of Repulses, charge again;</L>
<L>They Mine and Countermine, resolv'd to win,</L>
<L>And, if a Breach is made—they will come in.</L>
<L>You'll think, by what we have of Soldiers said,</L>
<L>Our Female Wit was in the Service bred;</L>
<L>But she is to the hardy Toil a Stranger,</L>
<L>She loves the Cloth indeed, but hates the Danger;</L>
<L>Yet to this Circle of the Brave and Gay,</L>
<L>She bid me for her good Intentions say,</L>
<L>She hopes you'll not reduce her to Half-Pay.</L>
<L>As for our Play, 'tis <HI>English</HI> Humour all;</L>
<L>Then will you let our Manufacture fall?</L>
<L>Would you the Honour of our Nation raise,</L>
<L>Keep <HI>English</HI> Credit up, and <HI>English</HI> Plays.</L>

<P>Ay, at t'other End of the Town, where you Of∣ficers use, Women are good Forcers of Trade; a well∣custom'd House, a handsome Bar-keeper, with clean ob∣liging Drawers, soon get the Master an Estate; but our Citizens seldom do any thing but cheat within the Walls—But as to the Lady, <HI>Colonel;</HI> point you at Particu∣lars, or have you a good <HI>Champagne</HI> Stomack? Are you in full Pay, or reduc'd, <HI>Colonel?</HI></P>

<P>Know her! Ay, poor <HI>Nancy;</HI> I have carried her to School many a frosty Morning. Alas, if she's the Wo∣man, I pity you, <HI>Colonel:</HI> Her Father, my old Master, was the most whimsical, out-of-the-way temper'd Man, I ever heard of, as you will guess by his last Will and Testament—This was his only Child: I have heard him wish her dead a thousand times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sack.</SPEAKER>
<P>He hated Posterity, you must know, and wish'd the World were to expire with himself—He used to swear, if she had been a Boy, he would have qualify'd him for the <HI>Opera.</HI></P>

<SP>

<P>'Tis a very unnatural Resolution in a Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Sack.</SPEAKER>
<P>He dy'd worth Thirty thousand Pounds, which he left to this Daughter, provided she married with the Consent of her Guardians: But that she might be sure never to do so, he left her in the Care of four Men, as opposite to each other as Light and Darkness: Each has his quarterly Rule, and three Months in a Year she is oblig'd to be subject to each of their Humours, and they are pretty different, I assure you—She is just come from <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas there I saw her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, the last Quarter was her Beau Guar∣dian's—She appears in all publick Places during his Reign.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>She visited a Lady who boarded in the same House with me: I lik'd her Person, and found an Op∣portunity to tell her so: She reply'd, she had no Obje∣ction to mine; but if I could not reconcile Contra∣dictions, I must not think of her, for that she was con∣demned to the Caprice of four Persons, who never yet agreed in any one thing, and she was oblig'd to please them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sack.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis most true, Sir; I'll give you a short De∣scription of the Men, and leave you to judge of the poor Lady's Condition. One is a kind of a <HI>Virtuoso,</HI> a silly, half-witted Fellow, but positive and surly; fond of nothing but what is Antique and Foreign, and wears his Cloaths of the Fashion of the last Century; doats upon Travellers, and believes Sir <HI>John Mandiville</HI> more than the Bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must be a rare old Fellow!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another is a Change-Broker; a Fellow that will out-lie the Devil for the Advantage of Stock, and cheat his Father that got him in a Bargain: He is a great Stickler for Trade and hates every thing that wears a Sword.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a great Admirer of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Management, and swears they understand Trade better than any Nation under the Sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sack.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Third is an old Beau, that has <HI>May</HI> in his Fancy and Dress, but <HI>December</HI> in his Face and his Heels;
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
he admires nothing but new Fashions, and those must be <HI>French;</HI> loves Operas, Balls, Masquerades, and is always the most tawdry of the whole Company on a Birth-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are pretty opposite to one another, truly! And the fourth, what is he, Landlord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sack.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very rigid <HI>Quaker,</HI> whose Quarter begun this Day—I saw Mrs. <HI>Lovely</HI> go in not above two Hours ago—Sir <HI>Philip</HI> set her down. What think you now, <HI>Colonel,</HI> is not the poor Lady to be pity'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and rescued too, Landlord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my Opinion, that's impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing impossible to a Lover. What would not a Man attempt for a fine Woman and Thirty Thousand Pounds? Besides, my Honour is at Stake; I promis'd to deliver her—and she bad me win her, and take her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's fair, faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it depended upon Knight-Errantry, I should not doubt your setting free the Damsel; but to have A∣varice, Impertinence, Hypocrifie, and Pride, at once to deal with, requires more Cunning than generally attends a Man of Honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Fancy tells me I shall come off with Glory; I resolve to try, however.—Do you know all the Guardians, Mr. <HI>Sackbut?</HI></P>

<P>In every thing I can, <HI>Colonel.</HI></P>

<P>I'll answer for him; and whatever I can serve you in, you may depend on. I know Mr. <HI>Periwinkle</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tradelove;</HI> the latter has a very great Opinion of my Interest Abroad.—I happen'd to have a Letter from a Correspondent two Hours before the News arrived of the <HI>French</HI> King's Death; I communicated it to him; upon which he bought up all the Stock he could, and what with that, and some Wagers he laid, he told me, he had got to the Tune of Five Hundred Pounds; so that I am much in his good Graces.</P>

<P>O hang 'em—No, <HI>Colonel,</HI> they keep nothing ready-made that a Gentleman would be seen in: But I can fit you with a Suit of Cloaths, if you'd make a Figure—Velvet and Gold Brocade—they were pawn'd to me by a <HI>French</HI> Count, who had been stript at Play, and wanted Money to carry him home; he promis'd to send for them, but I have heard nothing from him.</P>

<P>Must I be condemned all my Life to the preposterous Humours of other People; and pointed at by every Boy in Town?—Oh! I could tear my Flesh, and curse the Hour I was born.—Is it not monstrously ridiculous, that they should desire to im∣pose their Quaking Dress upon me at these Years? When I was a Child, no matter what they made me wear; but now—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd resolve against it, <HI>Madam;</HI> I'd see 'em hang'd before I'd put on the pinch'd Cap again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must never expect one Moment's Ease; she has rung such a Peal in my Ears already, that I shan't have the right Use of them this Month—What can I do?</P>

<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can you not do, if you will but give your Mind to it? Marry, Madam.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! and have my Fortune go to build Churches and Hospitals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, let it go—If the <HI>Colonel</HI> loves you, as he pretends, he'll marry you without a Fortune, Ma∣dam; and I assure you, a <HI>Colonel</HI>'s Lady is no despicable thing; a <HI>Colonel</HI>'s Post will maintain you like a Gentlewo¦man, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you wou'd advise me to give up my own Fortune, and throw my self upon the <HI>Colonel</HI>'s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would advise you to make your self easie, Ma∣dam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's not the Way, I am sure. No, no, Girl, there are certain Ingredients to be mingled with Matrimony, without which, I may as well change for the worse as for the better. When the Woman has For∣tune enough to make the Man happy, if he has either Ho∣nour or Good Manners, he'll make her easie. Love makes but a slovenly Figure in that House, where Poverty keeps the Door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you resolve to die a Maid, do you Ma∣dam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or have it in my Power to make the Man I love, Master of my Fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you don't like the <HI>Colonel</HI> so well as I thought you did, Madam, or you would not take such a Resolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is because I do like him, <HI>Betty,</HI> that I take such a Resolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, do you expect, Madam, the <HI>Colonel</HI> can work Miracles? Is it possible for him to marry you with the Consent of all your Guardians?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Love.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or he must not marry me at all, and so I told him; and he did not seem displeas'd with the News.—He promis'd to set me free, and I, on the Condition, promis'd to make him Master of that Free∣dom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! I have read of inchanted Castles, Ladies delivered from the Chains of Magick, Giants kill'd, and Monsters overcome; so that I shall be the less surpriz'd, if the <HI>Colonel</HI> should conjure your
<PB N="9" REF="21"/>
out of the Power of your Guardians: If he does, I am sure he deserves your Fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>And shall have it, Girl, if it were ten times as much—For I'll ingenuously confess to thee, that I do like the <HI>Colonel</HI> above all Men I ever saw—There's some∣thing so <HI>Jantée</HI> in a Soldier, a kind of a <HI>Je ne scay quoi</HI> Air, that makes 'em more agreeable than the rest of Man∣kind—They command Regard, as who should say, We are your Defenders, We preserve your Beauties from the Insults of rude unpolish'd Foes, and ought to be preferr'd before those lazy indolent Mortals, who by dropping into their Fathers Estate set up their Coaches, and think to rat∣tle themselves into our Affections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Madam, I confess that the Army has en∣gross'd all the prettiest Fellows—A lac'd Coat and Feather have irresistable Charms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the <HI>Colonel</HI> has all the Beauties of the Mind, as well as Person.—O all ye Powers, that favour happy Lovers, grant he may be mine! Thou God of Love, if thou be'st ought but Name, assist my <HI>Fainwell.</HI></P>

<P>And I have the Honour to be very well with the Ladies, I can assure you, Sir; and I won't affront a Million of fine Women, to make one happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Marriage is really reducing a Man's Taste to a kind of half Pleasure, but then it carries the Blessing of Peace along with it, one goes to sleep without Fear, and wakes without Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's something of that in't; a Wife is a very good Dish for an <HI>English</HI> Stomach—but gross Feeding for nicer Palates, ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find I was very much mistaken,—I imagin'd, you had been married to that young Lady which I saw in the Chariot with you this Morning in <HI>Grace-church-street.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, <HI>Nancy Lovely?</HI> I am a Piece of a Guar∣dian to that Lady, you must know; her Father, I thank him, join'd me with three of the most preposterous old Fellows—that upon my Soul I'm in pain for the poor Girl,—she must certainly lead Apes, as the Say∣ing is; ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's pity, Sir <HI>Philip;</HI> if the Lady would give me leave, I would endeavour to avert that Curse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Lady, she'd gladly be rid of us at any Rate, I believe; but here's the Mischief, he who marries Miss <HI>Lovely,</HI> must have the Consent of us all four,—or not a Penny of her Portion.—For my Part, I shall never approve of any, but a Man of Fi∣gure,—and the rest are not only averse to Clean∣liness, but have each a peculiar Taste to gratify.—For my Part, I declare, I would prefer you to all Men I ever saw.—</P>

<P>And I her to all Women—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Mr. <HI>Fainwell,</HI> I am for marry∣ing her, for I hate the Trouble of a Guardian, especially among such Wretches; but resolve never to agree to the Choice of any one of them,—and I fancy they'll be even with me, for they never came into any Proposal of mine yet.</P>

<P>I am sorry for't, Sir, because I think it the great∣est Curiosity I ever heard of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>By the Advice of a learned Phisiognomist in <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> who consulted the Lines in my Face, I returned to <HI>England,</HI> where, he told me, I should find a Rarity in the Keeping of four Men, which I was born to possess for the Benefit of Mankind, and the first of the four that gave me his Consent, I should present him with this Girdle—Till I have found this Jewel, I shall not part with the Girdle.</P>

<P>What can that Rarity be? Did he not name it to you?</P>

<P>Yes, Sir; he call'd it a Chaste, Beautiful, Unaf∣fected Woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pish! Women are no Rarities.—I never had any great Taste that Way. I married, indeed, to please a Father, and I got a Girl to please my Wife; but she and the Child (thank Heaven) died together—Women are the very Gewgaws of the Creation; Play-things for Boys, which, when they write Man, they ought to throw aside.</P>

<P>Or, in all the artful Mixture of their various Dresses, have they half the Beauty of one Box of Butter∣flies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that must be allow'd—For my part, if it were not for the Benefit of Mankind, I'd have nothing to do with them, for they are as indifferent to me, as a Sparrow or a Flesh-Fly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, what Benefit is the World to reap from this Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, she is to bear me a Son, who shall re∣store the Art of Embalming, and the old <HI>Roman</HI> Man∣ner of Burying their Dead; and, for the Benefit of Poste∣rity, he is to discover the Longitude, so long sought for in vain.</P>

<P>Ay, ay, one thing or another over-reach'd you all—but I'll take care he shall never finger a Penny ofher Money, I warrant you,—Over-reach'd quoth'a?

<P>No, as you say, at that Time it did not, that was not my lucky Hour;—but hark ye, Sir, I must let you into one Secret—you may keep honest <HI>John Tradescant</HI>'s Coat on, for your Uncle Sir <HI>Toby Periwinkle</HI> is not dead,—so the Charge of Mourning will be saved, ha, ha,—don't you remember Mr. <HI>Pillage</HI> your Uncle's Steward, ha, ha, ha.</P>

<P>Well, and what signifies that Lease, if my Uncle is not dead? ha! I am sure it was a Lease I sign'd.—</P>

<P>Sir, the Gentleman is a fine Gentleman.—I am glad you have got a Person, Madam, who under∣stands Dress and good Breeding,—I was resolved she should have a Husband of my chusing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob. Pr.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, Gentlemen,—I am the Person who can give the best Account of my self, and I must beg Sir <HI>Philip</HI>'s Pardon, when I tell him that I have as much Aversion to what he calls Dress and Breeding, as I have to the Enemies of my Religion. I have had the Honour to serve his Majesty, and headed a Regiment of the bravest Fellows that ever push'd Bayonet in the Throat of a <HI>Frenchman;</HI> and, notwithstanding the Fortune

this Lady brings me, whenever my Country wants my Aid, this Sword and Arm are at her Service.</P>
<L><HI>And now, my Fair, if you'll but deign to smile,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I meet a Recompence for all my Toil:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Love and Religion ne'er admit Restraint,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Force makes many a Sinner, not one Saint;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Still free as Air the active Mind does rove,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And searches proper Objects for its Love;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But that once fix'd, 'tis past the Power of Art,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To chase the dear Ideas from the Heart:</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Tis Liberty of Choice that sweetens Life,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Makes the glad Husband, and the happy Wise.</HI></L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Mr. SEWELL.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. BƲLLOCK.</STAGE>
<L>WHAT new strange Ways our Modern</L>
<L>Beaus devise!</L>
<L>What Tryals of Love-Skill to gain the Prize!</L>
<L>The Heathen Gods, who never matter'd Rapes,</L>
<L>Scarce wore such strange Variety of Shapes:</L>
<L>The Devil take their odious barren Skulls,</L>
<L>To court in Form of Snakes and filthy Bulls.</L>
<L>Old Jove once nick'd it, I am told,</L>
<L>In a whole Lapful of true Standard Gold;</L>
<L>How must his Godship then Fair <HI>Danaë</HI> warm?</L>
<L>In trucking Ware for Ware there is no Harm.</L>
<L>Well, after all—that <HI>Money</HI> has a Charm:</L>
<L>But now indeed that stale Invention's past:</L>
<L>Besides, you know, that Guineas fall so fast,</L>
<L>Poor Nymph must come to Pocket-Piece at last.</L>
<L>Old <HI>Harry</HI>'s Face, or good Queen <HI>Bess</HI>'s Ruff,</L>
<L>Not that I'd take 'em—may do well enough;</L>
<L><PB REF="84"/>
No—my ambitious Spirit's far above</L>
<L>Those little Tricks of Mercenary Love.</L>
<L>That Man be mine, who, like the Colonel here,</L>
<L>Can top his Character in every Sphere;</L>
<L>Who can a thousand Ways employ his Wit,</L>
<L>Out-promise Statesmen, and out-cheat a Cit;</L>
<L>Beyond the Colours of a Trav'ler paint,</L>
<L>And cant, and ogle too—beyond a Saint.</L>
<L>The last Disguise most pleas'd me, I confess,</L>
<L>There's something tempting in the preaching Dress;</L>
<L>And pleas'd me more than once a Dame of Note,</L>
<L>Who lov'd her Husband in his Footman's Coat.</L>
<L>To see one Eye in wanton Motions play'd,</L>
<L>Th'other to the Heavenly Regions stray'd,</L>
<L>As if it for its Fellow's Frailties pray'd.</L>
<L>But yet I hope, for all that I have said,</L>
<L>To find my Spouse a Man of War in Bed.</L>
