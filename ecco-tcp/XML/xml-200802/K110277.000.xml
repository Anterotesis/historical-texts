<HEAD>THE LIFE OF EDWARD MOORE.</HEAD>
<P>OF the life of this ingenious writer few particulars are known, and none respecting his descent, birth, education, or death; at least none which we have been able to discover.</P>
<P>Mr. Moore was bred a linendraper, but whether from a stronger attachment to the study than the coun∣ter, from a more ardent zeal in the pursuit of fame than in the search after fortune, or whether from the cause assigned by our Author himself in the Preface to the quarto edition of his works in 1756, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his marriage with the Muses, like most other marriages into that noble family, was more from necessity than inclination,"</Q> he quitted business to join the retinue of these ladies; and he certainly had a very happy and pleasant talent in poetry. In his Trial of Selim the Per∣sian, which is a compliment to the first and worthy Lord Lyttelton, he has shewn himself a perfect master of the most elegant kind of panegyrick, that which is couched under the appearance of accusation; and his
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Fables for the Female Sex, not only in the freedom and ease of the verfification, but also in the forcibleness of the moral and poignancy of the satire, approach nearer to the manner of Mr. Gay than any of the numerous imitations of that author which have been attempted since the publication of his Fables.</P>
<P>As a dramatick writer Mr. Moore has by no means met with the success his pieces have merited, which are three in number, The Foundling and Gil Blas, comedies, and The Gamester, a tragedy. The first has been condemned for its supposed resemblance to the celebrated comedy of The Conscious Lovers; and The Gamester met with a cold reception for no other apparent reason but because it too nearly touched a favourite and fashionable vice<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Gamester was also objected to as too prosaick in the language, and too horrible in the catastrophe, as observed and apologized for by the Author in his Preface to The Gamester, quarto edition of 1756.</NOTE>. Yet on the whole his plots are interesting, his characters well drawn, his sentiments delicate, and his language poetical and pleasing; and what crowns all and more forcibly claims for his Writings publick notice, the greatest purity pervades the whole, the obvious tendency of every piece being the promotion of morality and vir∣tue; as is indeed observed by the Author himself in the Preface already referred to, when speaking of his
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
Writings in general; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Such as the Work now is I sub∣mit it to the publick. Defects in it there are many.—Its merit (if it has any, and I may be allowed to name it) is its being natural and unaffected, and <HI>tending to promote virtue.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Moore married a lady of the name of Hamil∣ton, daughter to the Tabledecker to the Princesses: she had a poetical turn, and has been said to have assist∣ed her husband in the writing of his plays. One spe∣cimen of her poetry was handed about before their marriage, and has since appeared in different collec∣tions of songs. It was addressed to a daughter of the famous Stephen Duck, and begins with the following stanza:<Q><LG>
<L>Would you think it my Duck! for the fault I must own,</L>
<L>Your Jenny at last is quite covetous grown;</L>
<L>Tho' millions if Fortune should lavishly pour</L>
<L>I still should be wretched if I had not <HI>More.</HI></L>
</LG></Q> After half-a-dozen other stanzas, in which with great ingenuity and delicacy, and yet in a manner that ex∣presses a sincere affection, she has quibbled on our Au∣thor's name, she concludes with the following lines:<Q><L>You will wonder my Girl! who this dear one can be</L>
<L>Whose merit can boast such a conquest as me;</L>
<L>But you sh' n't know his name, tho' I told you before;</L>
<L>It begins with an M, but I dare not say <HI>More.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>In the year 1753 Mr. Moore commenced a weekly
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
miscellaneous paper entitled The World, by Adam Fitz-Adam, in which undertaking he was assisted by Lord Chesterfield and other distinguished characters. This paper was collected and published in four vo∣lumes; and Mr. Moore died soon thereafter.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MOST of the following Poems have already made their appearance in detached pieces, but as many of them were printed without a name I was advised by some particular friends to collect them into a volume and publish them by subscription. The painful task of soliciting such a subscription was chiefly undertaken by those friends, and with such spirit and zeal that I should be greatly wanting in gratitude if I neglected any opportunity either publick or private of making them my most sincere acknowledgments. I am also obliged to a very valuable friend in Ireland for a con∣siderable number of subscribers in that kingdom, a list of whose names I have not been favoured with, and for which I was desired not to delay publication. I mention this seeming neglect that my friends on that side the water may not accuse me of any disrespect.</P>
<P>Such as the Work now is I submit it to the publick. Defects in it there are many, which I have wanted both time and abilities to amend as I could wish. Its merit (if it has any, and I may be allowed to name it) is its being natural and unaffected, and tending to promote virtue and good-humour. Those parts of it that have been published singly had the good fortune to please; those that are now added will I hope be no discredit to them. Upon the whole, I have sent this my offspring into the world in as decent a dress as I
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
was able: a legitimate one I am sure it is; and if it should be thought defective in strength, spirit, or vi∣gour, let it be considered that its father's marriage with the Muses, like most other marriages into that noble family, was more from necessity than inclina∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THOMAS HOLLES, DUKE OF NEWCASTLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD I the honour of being personally known to your Grace I had not thus presumptuously addressed you without previous solicitation for so great an indul∣gence; but that your Grace may neither be surprised nor offended at the liberty I am taking my plea is, that the great and good man whose name is prefixed to the first of these Poems was a friend and benefac∣tor to me. The favours I have received at his hands, and the kind assurances he was pleased to give me of their continuance, which his death only prevented, have left me to lament my own private loss amidst the general concern. It is from these favours and assurances that I flatter myself with having a kind of privilege to address your Grace upon this occasion, and to entreat your patronage of the following sheets. I pretended to no merit with Mr. Pelham except that of honouring his virtues, and wishing to have been serviceable to them: I pretend to no other with your Grace. My hopes are, that while you are fulfilling every generous intention of the brother whom you loved your Grace will not think me unworthy of some small share of that notice with which he was once pleased to honour me.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
I will not detain your Grace to echo back the voice of a whole people in favour of your just and prudent administration of publick affairs: that the salutary mea∣sures you are pursuing may be as productive of tran∣quillity and honour to your Grace as they are of hap∣piness to these kingdoms is the sincere wish of,</P>

<L>The birds in place, by factions press'd,</L>

<L>The Crow was vex'd: as yester-morn</L>

<L>A screaming boy was set for pay</L>

<HEAD>FABLE II. THE PANTHER, THE HORSE, AND OTHER BEASTS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE man who seeks to win the fair</L>
<L>(So custom says) must truth forbear,</L>
<L>Must fawn and flatter, cringe and lie,</L>
<L>And raise the goddess to the sky,</L>
<L N="5"><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
For truth is hateful to her ear,</L>
<L>A rudeness which she cannot bear.</L>
<L>A rudeness! yes: I speak my thoughts,</L>
<L>For Truth upbraids her with her faults.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How wretched Cloe! then am I</L>
<L N="10">Who love you and yet cannot lie,</L>
<L>And still to make you less my friend</L>
<L>I strive your errours to amend!</L>
<L>But shall the senseless fop impart</L>
<L>The softest passion to your heart,</L>
<L N="15">While he who tells you honest truth,</L>
<L>And points to happiness your youth,</L>
<L>Determines by his care his lot,</L>
<L>And lives neglected and forgot?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Trust me my Dear! with greater ease</L>
<L N="20">Your taste for flatt'ry I could please,</L>
<L>And similies in each dull line</L>
<L>Like glow-worms in the dark should shine.</L>
<L>What if I say your lips disclose</L>
<L>The freshness of the op'ning rose?</L>
<L N="25">Or that your cheeks are beds of flow'rs</L>
<L>Enripen'd by refreshing show'rs?</L>
<L>Yet certain as these flow'rs shall fade</L>
<L>Time ev'ry beauty will invade.</L>
<L>The butterfly of various hue</L>
<L N="30">More than the flow'r resembles you,</L>
<L>Fair, flutt'ring, fickle, busy, thing,</L>
<L>To pleasure ever on the wing,</L>

Gayly coquetting for an hour,</L>
<L>To die and n'er be thought of more!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="35">Would you the bloom of youth should last?</L>
<L>'Tis virtue that must bind it fast,</L>
<L>An easy carriage, wholly free</L>
<L>From sour reserve or levity,</L>
<L>Goodnatur'd mirth, an open heart,</L>
<L N="40">And looks unskill'd in any art,</L>
<L>Humility enough to own</L>
<L>The frailties which a friend makes known,</L>
<L>And decent pride enough to know</L>
<L>The worth that virtue can bestow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="45">These are the charms which ne'er decay</L>
<L>Tho' youth and beauty fade away;</L>
<L>And time which all things else removes</L>
<L>Still heightens virtue and improves.</L>

<L>You 'll frown and ask to what intent</L>
<L N="50">This blunt address to you is sent?</L>
<L>I 'll spare the question, and confess</L>
<L>I 'd praise you if I lov'd you less;</L>
<L>But rail, be angry, or complain,</L>
<L>I will be rude while you are vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="55">Beneath a lion's peaceful reign,</L>
<L>When beasts met friendly on the plain,</L>
<L>A Panther of majestick port,</L>
<L>(The vainest female of the court)</L>

With spotted skin and eyes of fire,</L>
<L N="60">Fill'd ev'ry bosom with desire:</L>
<L>Where'er she mov'd a servile crowd</L>
<L>Of fawning creatures cring'd and bow'd;</L>
<L>Assemblies ev'ry week she held,</L>
<L>(Like modern belles) with coxcombs fill'd,</L>
<L N="65">Where noise, and nonsense, and grimace,</L>
<L>And lies and scandal, fill'd the place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold the gay fantastick thing</L>
<L>Encircled by the spacious ring:</L>
<L>Low-bowing with important look</L>
<L N="70">As first in rank the Monkey spoke.</L>
<L>"Gad take me Madam! but I swear</L>
<L>"No angel ever look'd so fair!</L>
<L>"Forgive my rudeness, but I vow</L>
<L>"You were not quite divine till now!</L>

<L>"O! close them or the gazer dies!"</L>

<L>"Nay, gentle Pug! for goodness hush;</L>
<L>"I vow and swear you make me blush:</L>
<L>"I shall be angry at this rate;</L>
<L N="80">"'Tis so like flatt'ry, which I hate."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Fox, in deeper cunning vers'd,</L>
<L>The beauties of her mind rehears'd,</L>
<L>And talk'd of knowledge, taste, and sense,</L>
<L>To which the fair have vast pretence!</L>
<L N="85">Yet well he knew them always vain</L>
<L>Of what they strive not to attain,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
And play'd so cunningly his part</L>
<L>That Pug was rivall'd in his art.</L>

<L>The Goat avow'd his am'rous flame,</L>
<L N="90">And burnt—for what he durst not name,</L>
<L>Yet hop'd a meeting in the wood</L>
<L>Might make his meaning understood.</L>
<L>Half angry at the bold address</L>
<L>She frown'd; but yet she must confess</L>
<L N="95">Such beauties might inflame his blood;</L>
<L>But still his phrase was somewhat rude.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Hog her neatness much admir'd,</L>
<L>The formal Ass her swiftness fir'd,</L>
<L>While all to feed her folly strove,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Horse, whose gen'rous heart disdain'd</L>
<L>Applause by servile flatt'ry gain'd,</L>
<L>With graceful courage silence broke,</L>
<L>And thus with indignation spoke:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="105">"When flatt'ring Monkies fawn and prate</L>
<L>"They justly raise contempt or hate,</L>

<L>"The artful Fox your wit commends</L>
<L N="110">"To lure you to his selfish ends;</L>
<L>"From the vile flatt'rer turn away,</L>

<L>"Dismiss the train of fops and fools,</L>

"Such beauties might the Lion warm</L>
<L>"Did not your folly break the charm;</L>
<L>"For who would court that lovely shape</L>
<L>"To be the rival of an Ape?"</L>

<L>Proclaim'd the person with the vice,</L>

<L>Upon this plan a champion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of the Letters to the Whigs.</NOTE> rose</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>That what he wrote to Gilbert West</L>

<L>He either dream'd it or was told</L>

<HEAD>THE TRIAL OF SARAH ****, ALIAS SLIM SAL, FOR PRIVATELY STEALING.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE pris'ner was at large indicted,</L>
<L>For that by thirst of gain excited,</L>
<L>One day in July last at tea,</L>
<L>And in the house of Mrs. P.</L>
<L N="5">From the left breast of E. M. Gent.</L>
<L>With base felonious intent,</L>
<L>Did then and there a heart with strings,</L>

<L>Steal, rob, and plunder, and all them</L>
<L N="10">The chattels of the said E. M.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The prosecutor swore last May</L>
<L>(The month he knew but not the day)</L>
<L>He left his friends in Town, and went</L>
<L>Upon a visit down in Kent;</L>
<L N="15">That staying there a month or two</L>
<L>He spent his time, as others do,</L>
<L>In riding, walking, fishing, swimming,</L>
<L>But being much inclin'd to women,</L>
<L>And young and wild, and no great reas'ner,</L>
<L N="20">He got acquainted with the pris'ner.</L>
<L>He own'd 't was rumour'd in those parts</L>
<L>That she 'd a trick of stealing hearts,</L>
<L><PB N="127" REF="128"/>
And from fifteen to twenty-two</L>
<L>Had made the devil-and-all to do:</L>
<L N="25">But Mr. W. the Vicar</L>
<L>(And no man brews you better liquor)</L>
<L>Spoke of her thefts as tricks of youth,</L>
<L>The frolicks of a girl forsooth;</L>
<L>Things now were on another score</L>
<L N="30">He said, for she was twenty-four.</L>
<L>However, to make matters short,</L>
<L>And not to trespass on the court,</L>
<L>The lady was discover'd soon,</L>
<L>And thus it was. One afternoon,</L>
<L N="35">The ninth of July last, or near it,</L>
<L>(As to the day he could not swear it)</L>
<L>In company at Mrs. P's,</L>
<L>Where folks say any thing they please,</L>
<L>Dean L. and Lady Mary by,</L>
<L N="40">And Fanny waiting on Miss Y.</L>
<L>(He own'd he was inclin'd to think</L>
<L>Both were a little in their drink)</L>
<L>The pris'ner ask'd, and call'd him Cousin,</L>
<L>How many kisses made a dozen?</L>
<L N="45">That being as he own'd in liquor</L>
<L>The question made his blood run quicker,</L>
<L>And sense and reason in eclipse</L>
<L>He vow'd he 'd score them on her lips:</L>
<L>That rising up to keep his word</L>
<L N="50">He got as far as kiss the third,</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="129"/>
And would have counted th' other nine,</L>
<L>And so all present did opine,</L>
<L>But that he felt a sudden dizziness</L>
<L>That quite undid him for the business;</L>
<L N="55">His speech he said began to falter,</L>
<L>His eyes to stare, his mouth to water,</L>
<L>His breast to thump without cessation,</L>
<L>And all within one conflagration.</L>
<L>"Bless me!" says Fanny, "what 's the matter?"</L>
<L N="60">And Lady Mary look'd hard at her,</L>
<L>And stamp'd and wish'd the pris'ner further,</L>
<L>And cry'd out, "Part them, or there 's murther!"</L>
<L>That still he held the pris'ner fast,</L>
<L>And would have stood it to the last,</L>
<L N="65">But struggling to go thro' the rest</L>
<L>He felt a pain across his breast,</L>
<L>A sort of sudden twinge he said,</L>
<L>That seem'd almost to strike him dead,</L>
<L>And after that such cruel smarting</L>
<L N="70">He thought the soul and body parting:</L>
<L>That then he let the pris'ner go,</L>
<L>And stagger'd off a step or so,</L>
<L>And thinking that his heart was ill</L>
<L>He begg'd of Miss Y 's maid to feel:</L>
<L N="75">That Fanny stepp'd before the rest</L>
<L>And laid her hand upon his breast,</L>
<L>But mercy on us! what a stare</L>
<L>The creature gave! no heart was there:</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="130"/>
Souse went her fingers in the hole,</L>
<L N="80">Whence heart and strings and all were stole:</L>
<L>That Fanny turn'd and told the pris'ner</L>
<L>She was a thief, and so she 'd christen her,</L>
<L>And that it was a burning shame,</L>
<L>And brought the house an evil name,</L>
<L N="85">And if she did not put the heart in</L>
<L>The man would pine and die for certain.</L>
<L>The pris'ner then was in her airs,</L>
<L>And bid her mind her own affairs,</L>
<L>And told his Rev'rence and the rest of 'em</L>
<L N="90">She was as honest as the best of 'em:</L>
<L>That lady Mary and dean L.</L>
<L>Rose up and said 't was mighty well;</L>
<L>But that in gen'ral terms they said it,</L>
<L>A heart was gone and some one had it;</L>
<L N="95">Words would not do, for search they must,</L>
<L>And search they would, and her the first:</L>
<L>That then the pris'ner dropp'd her anger,</L>
<L>And said she hop'd they would not hang her;</L>
<L>That all she did was meant in jest,</L>
<L N="100">And there the heart was and the rest:</L>
<L>That then the dean cry'd out O fy!</L>
<L>And sent in haste for justice I.</L>
<L>Who tho' he knew her friends and pity'd her</L>
<L>Call'd her hard names, and so committed her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="105">The parties present swore the same,</L>
<L>And Fanny said the pris'ner's name</L>
<L><PB N="130" REF="131"/>
Had frighten'd all the country round,</L>
<L>And glad she was the bill was found:</L>
<L>She knew a man who knew another,</L>
<L N="110">Who knew the very party's brother</L>
<L>Who lost his heart by mere surprise</L>
<L>One morning looking at her eyes;</L>
<L>And others had been known to squeak</L>
<L>Who only chanc'd to hear her speak;</L>
<L N="115">For she had words of such a sort</L>
<L>That tho' she knew no reason for 't</L>
<L>Would make a man of sense run mad,</L>
<L>And rifle him of all he had;</L>
<L>And that she 'd rob the whole community</L>
<L N="120">If ever she had opportunity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The pris'ner now first silence broke,</L>
<L>And curtsy'd round her as she spoke.</L>
<L>She own'd she said it much incens'd her</L>
<L>To hear such matters sworn against her,</L>
<L N="125">But that she hop'd to keep her temper,</L>
<L>And prove herself <HI>eadem semper:</HI></L>
<L>That what the prosecutor swore</L>
<L>Was some part true and some part more:</L>
<L>She own'd she had been often seen with him,</L>
<L>And laugh'd and chatted on the green with him;</L>
<L N="131">The fellow seem'd to have humanity,</L>
<L>And told her tales that sooth'd her vanity,</L>
<L>Pretending that he lov'd her vastly,</L>
<L>And that all women else look'd ghastly:</L>
<L N="135"><PB N="131" REF="132"/>
But then she hop'd the court would think</L>
<L>She never was inclin'd to drink,</L>
<L>Or suffer hands like his to daub her,</L>
<L>Or encourage men to kiss and slobber her:</L>
<L>She 'd have folks know she did not love it,</L>
<L N="140">Or if she did she was above it:</L>
<L>But this she said was sworn of course</L>
<L>To prove her giddy and then worse,</L>
<L>As she whose conduct was thought <HI>levis</HI></L>
<L>Might very well be reckon'd thievish.</L>
<L N="145">She hop'd she said the court's discerning</L>
<L>Would pay some honour to her learning,</L>
<L>For ev'ry day from four to past six</L>
<L>She went up stairs and read the classicks.</L>
<L>Thus having clear'd herself of levity,</L>
<L N="150">The rest she said would come with brevity.</L>
<L>And first it injur'd not her honour</L>
<L>To own the heart was found upon her,</L>
<L>For she could prove, and did aver,</L>
<L>The paltry thing belong'd to her.</L>
<L N="155">The fact was thus. This prince of knaves</L>
<L>Was once the humblest of her slaves,</L>
<L>And often had confess'd the dart</L>
<L>Her eyes had lodg'd within his heart:</L>
<L>That she, as 't was her constant fashion,</L>
<L N="160">Made great diversion of his passion,</L>
<L>Which set his blood in such a ferment</L>
<L>As seem'd to threaten his interment:</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="133"/>
That then she was afraid of losing him,</L>
<L>And so desisted from abusing him,</L>
<L N="165">And often came and felt his pulse,</L>
<L>And bid him write to Doctor Hulse.</L>
<L>The prosecutor thank'd her kindly,</L>
<L>And sigh'd, and said she look'd divinely;</L>
<L>But told her that his heart was bursting,</L>
<L N="170">And doctors he had little trust in;</L>
<L>He therefore begg'd her to accept it,</L>
<L>And hop'd 't would mend if once she kept it:</L>
<L>That having no aversion to it,</L>
<L>She said with all her soul she 'd do it;</L>
<L N="175">But then she begg'd him to remember</L>
<L>If he should need it in December</L>
<L>(For winter months would make folks shiver</L>
<L>Who wanted either heart or liver)</L>
<L>It never could return; and added</L>
<L N="180">'Twas her's for life if once she had it.</L>
<L>The prosecutor said Amen,</L>
<L>And that he wish'd it not again,</L>
<L>And took it from his breast and gave her,</L>
<L>And how'd and thank'd her for the favour,</L>
<L N="185">But begg'd the thing might not be spoke of,</L>
<L>As heartless men were made a joke of:</L>
<L>That next day whisp'ring him about it,</L>
<L>And asking how he felt without it?</L>
<L>He sigh'd, and cry'd, "Alack! alack!"</L>
<L N="190">And begg'd and pray'd to have it back,</L>
<L><PB N="133" REF="134"/>
Or that she 'd give him her's instead on 't,</L>
<L>But she conceiv'd there was no need on 't,</L>
<L>And said and bid him make no pother,</L>
<L>He should have neither one nor th' other:</L>
<L N="195">That then he rav'd and storm'd like Fury,</L>
<L>And said that one was his <HI>de jure,</HI></L>
<L>And rather than he 'd leave pursuing her</L>
<L>He 'd swear a robbery and ruin her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That this was truth she did aver</L>
<L N="200">Whatever hap betided her;</L>
<L>Only that Mrs. P. she said,</L>
<L>Miss Y. and her deluded maid,</L>
<L>And Lady Mary, and his Reverence,</L>
<L>Were folks to whom she paid some deference,</L>
<L N="205">And that she verily believ'd</L>
<L>They were not perjur'd but deceiv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Doctor D. begg'd leave to speak,</L>
<L>And sigh'd as if his heart would break.</L>
<L>He said that he was Madam's surgeon,</L>
<L N="210">Or rather, as in Greek, chirurgeon,</L>
<L>From <HI>chier, manus, ergon, opus,</HI></L>
<L>(As scope is from the Latin <HI>scopus:)</HI></L>
<L>That he he said had known the prisoner</L>
<L>From the first sun that ever rise on her,</L>
<L N="215">And griev'd he was to see her there,</L>
<L>But took upon himself to swear</L>
<L>There was not to be found in nature</L>
<L>A sweeter or a better creature;</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="135"/>
And if the king (God bless him!) knew her</L>
<L N="220">He 'd leave St. James's to get to her;</L>
<L>But then as to the fact in question</L>
<L>He knew no more on 't than Hephaestion;</L>
<L>It might he false and might be true,</L>
<L>And this he said was all he knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="225">The judge proceeded to the charge,</L>
<L>And gave the evidence at large,</L>
<L>But often cast a sheep's eye at her,</L>
<L>And strove to mitigate the matter,</L>
<L>Pretending facts were not so clear,</L>
<L N="230">And mercy ought to interfere.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The jury then withdrew a moment</L>
<L>As if on weighty points to comment,</L>
<L>And right or wrong resolv'd to save her</L>
<L>They gave a verdict in her favour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="235">But why or wherefore things were so</L>
<L>It matters not for us to know.</L>
<L>The culprit by escape grown bold</L>
<L>Pilfers alike from young and old,</L>

<L N="11">"I own that sometimes in contempt of all rules</L>

"The man shall be marry'd, so pray now be easy,</L>
<L>"And Garrick for once shall do something to please ye."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So saying she rattled her wheel out of sight,</L>
<L>While Envy walk'd after and grinn'd with delight.</L>
<L N="25">It seems it was a trick that she long had been brewing</L>
<L>To marry poor David and so be his ruin;</L>
<L>For Slander had told her the creature lov'd pelf,</L>
<L>And car'd not a fig for a soul but himself;</L>
<L>From thence she was sure had the devil a daughter</L>
<L>He'd snap at the girl so it was Fortune that brought her;</L>
<L N="31">And then should her temper be sullen or haughty,</L>
<L>Her flesh too be frail, and incline to be naughty,</L>

<LG>
<L N="35">But Fortune, who saw what the Fury design'd,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to get David a wife to his mind,</L>
<L>Yet afraid of herself in a matter so nice</L>
<L>She visited Prudence and begg'd her advice.</L>
<L>The nymph shook her head when the bus'ness she knew,</L>
<L N="40">And said that her female acquaintance were few;</L>
<L>That excepting Miss R***—O yes! there was one,</L>
<L>A friend of that lady's, she visited none;</L>

<L>And as for the rest she might get whom she cou'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="45">Away hurry'd Fortune, perplex'd and half mad,</L>
<L>But her promise was pass'd, and a wife must be had:</L>
<L>She travers'd the Town from one corner to th' other,</L>
<L>Now knocking at one door and then at another.</L>

The girls curtsy'd low as she look'd in their faces,</L>
<L>And bridled and primm'd with abundance of graces;</L>
<L N="51">But this was conquettish and that was a prude,</L>
<L>One stupid and dull, th' other noisy and rude;</L>
<L>A third was affected, quite careless a fourth,</L>
<L>With prate without meaning and pride without worth;</L>
<L N="55">A fifth, and a sixth, and a seventh, were such</L>
<L>As either knew nothing or something too much.—</L>
<L>In short as they pass'd she to all had objections,</L>
<L>The gay wanted thought, the good-humour'd affections,</L>
<L>The prudent were ugly, the sensible dirty,</L>
<L N="60">And all of them flirts from fifteen up to thirty.</L>

<L>When Fortune saw this she began to look silly,</L>
<L>Yet still she went on till she reach'd Piccadilly,</L>
<L>But vex'd and fatigu'd, and the night growing late,</L>
<L>She rested her wheel within Burlington gate.</L>

<L>"To see me thus flurry'd"—then told her the case, lady,</L>
<L>And sigh'd till her ladyship laugh'd in her face.</L>
<L>"Mighty civil indeed!"—"Come, a truce," says my</L>

<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>THAT your Honour's petitioners (dealers in rhymes,</L>
<L>And writers of scandal for mending the times)</L>
<L>By losses in bus'ness and England's well doing</L>
<L>Are sunk in their credit and verging on ruin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="5">That these their misfortunes they humbly conceive</L>
<L>Arise not from dulness, as some folks believe,</L>
<L>But from rubs in their way which your Honour has laid,</L>
<L>And want of materials to carry on trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That they always had form'd high conceits of their use,</L>
<L>And meant their last breath should go out in abuse;</L>
<L N="11">But now (and they speak it with sorrow and tears)</L>
<L>Since your Honour has sat at the helm of affairs</L>
<L><PB N="140" REF="141"/>
No party will join them, no faction invite,</L>
<L>To heed what they say or to read what they write;</L>
<L N="15">Sedition, and Tumult, and Discord, are fled,</L>
<L>And Slander scarce ventures to lift up her head—</L>
<L>In short, publick bus'ness is so carry'd on</L>
<L>That their country is sav'd and the patriots undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To perplex them still more, and sure famine to bring,</L>
<L N="20">(Now satire has lost both its truth and its sting)</L>
<L>If in spite of their natures they bungle at praise</L>
<L>Your Honour regards not, and nobody pays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your petitioners therefore most humbly entreat</L>
<L>(As the times will allow and your Honour thinks meet)</L>
<L>That measures be chang'd, and some cause of complaint</L>
<L N="26">Be immediately furnish'd to end their restraint,</L>
<L>Their credit thereby and their trade to retrieve,</L>
<L>That again they may rail and the nation believe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or else (if your wisdom shall deem it all one)</L>
<L N="30">Now the Parliament 's rising and bus'ness is done,</L>
<L>That your Honour would please at this dangerous crisis</L>
<L>To take to your bosom a few private vices,</L>
<L>By which your petitioners haply might thrive,</L>
<L>And keep both themselves and contention alive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In compassion, good Sir! give them something to say,</L>
<L N="36">And your Honour's petitioners ever shall pray.</L>

The fellow stopp'd me in a hellish fright—</L>
<L>"Pray Sir," says he, "must I be damn'd to-night?"</L>
<L N="5">"Damn'd! surely friend. Do n't hope for our compli∣ance;</L>

<L>Tell him you 'ave left your charity behind ye.</L>
<L>A pretty plea, his wants to our regard!</L>
<L>As if we Bloods had bowels for a bard!</L>
<L>Besides, what men of spirit now-a-days</L>
<L N="20">Come to give sober judgments of new plays?</L>
<L>It argues some good nature to be quiet—</L>
<L>Good nature!—ay—but then we lose a riot.</L>
<L>The scribbling fool may beg and make a fuss;</L>
<L>'Tis death to him—what then?—'tis sport to us.</L>
<L N="25">Do n't mind me tho'—for all my fun and jokes</L>

<L>AMIDST these venerable drear remains</L>
<L>Of ancient grandeur musing sad I stray,</L>
<L>Around a melancholy silence reigns</L>
<L N="4">That prompts me to indulge the plaintive lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here liv'd Eugenio, born of noble race:</L>
<L>Aloft his mansion rose, around were seen</L>
<L N="7">Extensive gardens deck'd with ev'ry grace,</L>
<L>Ponds, walks, and groves, thro' all the seasons green.</L>

<L>Ah! where is now its boasted beauty fled?</L>
<L>Proud turrets that once glitter'd in the sky</L>

<L>Of splendid rooms no traces here are found:</L>
<L>How are these tott'ring walls by time defac'd,</L>
<L>Shagg'd with vile thorn, with twining ivy bound,</L>
<L N="16">Once hung with tapestry, with paintings grac'd!</L>
</LG>

<L>In ancient times perhaps where now I tread</L>
<L>Licentious Riot crown'd the midnight bowl,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or here attended by a chosen train</L>
<L>Of innocent delight true Grandeur dwelt,</L>
<L>Diffusing blessings o'er the distant plain,</L>
<L N="24">Health, joy, and happiness, by thousands felt.</L>

<L>Around now Solitude unjoyous reigns,</L>
<L>No gay gilt chariot hither marks the way,</L>
<L>No more with cheerful hopes the needy swains</L>
<L N="28">At the once bounteous gate their visits pay.</L>

<L>Which ev'ry clime was ransack'd to supply?</L>
<L>O'er the drear spot see desolation spread,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dead are the trees that once with nicest care</L>
<L>Arrang'd from op'ning blossoms shed perfume,</L>
<L>And thick with fruitage stood the pendent pear,</L>
<L N="36">The ruddy colour'd peach and glossy plum.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Extinct is all the family of flow'rs;</L>
<L>In vain I seek the arbour's cool retreat,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The groves where Pleasure walk'd her rounds decay,</L>
<L>The mead untill'd a barren aspect wears,</L>
<L>And where the sprightly fawn was wont to play</L>
<L N="48">O'ergrown with heath a dreary waste appears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In yonder wide-extended vale below</L>
<L>Where osiers spread a pond capacious stood,</L>
<L>From far by art the stream was taught to flow</L>
<L N="52">Whose liquid stores supply'd th' unfailing flood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft' here the silent angler took his place,</L>
<L>Intent to captivate the scaly fry—</L>
<L>But perish'd now are all the num'rous race,</L>
<L N="56">Dumb is the fountain and the channel dry.</L>
</LG>

<L>Here then, ye Great! behold th' uncertain state</L>
<L>Of earthly grandeur—Beauty, strength, and pow'r,</L>
<L>Alike are subject to the stroke of Fate,</L>
<L N="60">And flourish but the glory of an hour.</L>

<L>THAT Jenny's my friend, my delight, and my pride,</L>
<L>I always have boasted, and seek not to hide;</L>
<L>I dwell on her praises wherever I go:</L>
<L N="4">They say I 'm in love, but I answer No, no.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>At ev'ning oft'times with what pleasure I see</L>
<L>A note from her hand, "I 'll be with you at tea!"</L>
<L>My heart how it bounds when I hear her below!</L>
<L N="8">But say not 't is love, for I answer No, no.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>She sings me a song and I echo each strain,</L>
<L>Again I cry Jenny, sweet Jenny! again</L>
<L><PB N="170" REF="171"/>
I kiss her soft lips as if there I could grow,</L>
<L N="12">And fear I 'm in love tho' I answer No, no.</L>

<L>She tells me her faults as she sits on my knee;</L>
<L>I chide her, and swear she 's an angel to me:</L>

<L N="16">Who knows but she loves tho' she tells me No, no?</L>

<L>Yet such is my temper, so dull am I grown,</L>
<L>I ask not her heart but would conquer my own:</L>
<L>Her bosom's soft peace shall I seek to o'erthrow,</L>
<L N="20">And wish to persuade while I answer No, no?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>From beauty, and wit, and good humour, ah! why</L>
<L>Should Prudence advise and compel me to fly?</L>
<L>Thy bounties O Fortune! make haste to bestow,</L>
<L N="24">And let me deserve her or still I say No.</L>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>YOU tell me I 'm handsome, I know not how true,</L>
<L>And easy, and chatty, and good humour'd, too,</L>
<L>That my lips are as red as the rosebud in June,</L>
<L>And my voice like the nightingale's sweetly in tune:</L>
<L>All this has been told me by twenty before,</L>
<L N="6">But he that would win me must flatter me more.</L>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>If beauty from virtue receive no supply,</L>
<L>Or prattle from prudence, how wanting am I!</L>
<L>My ease and good humour short raptures will bring,</L>
<L>And my voice like the nightingale's know but a spring:</L>
<L>For charms such as these then your praises give o'er;</L>
<L N="12">To love me for life you must love me for more.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Then talk to me not of a shape or an air,</L>
<L>For Cloe the wanton can rival me there:</L>
<L>'Tis virtue alone that makes beauty look gay,</L>
<L>And brightens good humour as sunshine the day;</L>
<L>For that if you love me your flame shall be true,</L>
<L N="18">And I in my turn may be taught to love too.</L>

<HEAD>SONG X.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>HOW blest has my time been, whatdays have I known,</L>
<L>Since wedlock's soft bondage made Jesse my own!</L>
<L>So joyful my heart is, so easy my chain,</L>
<L N="4">That freedom is tasteless and roving a pain.</L>

<L>Thro' walks grown with woodbines as often we stray</L>

<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>To try her sweet temper sometimes am I seen</L>
<L>In revels all day with the nymphs on the green;</L>

Tho' painful my absence my doubts she beguiles,</L>
<L N="12">And meets me at night with compliance and smiles.</L>

<L>What tho' on her cheek the rose loses its hue,</L>

<L>HARK, hark! 't is a voice from the tomb;</L>

<L>All mournful the midnight bell rung</L>
<L>When Lucy, sad Lucy, arose,</L>

<L N="12">Where Colin's pale ashes repose:</L>
<L><PB N="173" REF="174"/>
All wet with the night's chilling dew</L>
<L>Her bosom embrac'd the cold ground,</L>

<L>While thus she lay sunk in despair,</L>

"I hear the kind call and obey;</L>

<HEAD>SONG XII.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>FOR a shape, and a bloom, and an air, and a mien,</L>
<L>Myrtilla was brightest of all the gay green,</L>
<L>But artfully wild and affectedly coy,</L>
<L N="4">Those her beauties invited her pride would destroy.</L>

<L>The conquest gain'd he left his prize,</L>

<L>But Heav'n will take the mourner's part</L>
