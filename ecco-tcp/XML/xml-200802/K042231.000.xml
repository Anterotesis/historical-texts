<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BOLD is the man, and compos mentis, scarce—</L>
<L>Who, in these nicer times, dares write a Farce;</L>
<L>A vulgar long—forgotten taste renew;</L>
<L>All now are Comedies, five acts, or two.</L>
<L>Authors have ever in a canting strain,</L>
<L>Begg'd mercy for the bantling of their brain:</L>
<L>That you, kind nurse, wou'd fondle 't on your lap,</L>
<L>And rear it with applause, that best of pap—</L>
<L>Thus babes have in their cradles scap'd a blow,</L>
<L>Tho' lame and ricketty from top to toe:</L>
<L>Our bard, with prologue-outworks has not fenc'd him,</L>
<L>For all that I shall say, will make against him.</L>
<L>Imprimis, this his piece—a Farce we call it—</L>
<L>Ergo, 'tis low—and ten to one you maul it!</L>
<L>Wou'd you, because 'tis low, no quarter give?</L>
<L>Black-guards, as well as Gentlemen, shou'd live.</L>
<L>'Tis downright English too—Nothing from France;</L>
<L>Except some beasts, which treat you with a dance.</L>
<L>With a Burletta too we shall present you—</L>
<L>And, not Italian—that will discontent you.</L>
<L>Nay, what is worse—you'll see it, and must know it—</L>
<L>I <HI>Thomas King,</HI> of <HI>King-street,</HI> am the poet:</L>
<L>The murder's out—the murderer detected;</L>
<L>May in one night, be try'd, condemn'd, dissected.</L>
<L>'Tis said, for Scandal's tongue will never cease;</L>
<L>That mischief's meant against our little piece:</L>
<L>Let me look round, I'll tell you how the case is—</L>
<L>There's not one frown a single brow disgraces;</L>
<L>I never saw a sweeter set of faces!</L>
<L>Suppose <HI>Old Nick,</HI> before you righteous folk,</L>
<L>Produce a farce, brimfull of mirth and joke;</L>
<L>Tho' he, at other times, wou'd fire your blood;</L>
<L>You'd clap his piece, and swear, 'twas <HI>devilish</HI> good!</L>
<L>Malice prepense! 'tis false!—it cannot be—</L>
<L>Light is my heart, from apprehensions free—</L>
<L>If you wou'd save <HI>Old Nick,</HI> you'll never damn poor me.</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> WILSON <HI>and</HI> MERVIN <HI>Booted.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY dear Jack—ten thousand thanks for your punctuality—ready equip'd, I see, to serve your friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can I serve you, my young Don Quix∣ote? Am I to be your Sancho while your Knight Errantship is running away with this Dulcinea del Toboso?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have given orders that my post-chaise shall wait in the broad way by Exeter-Change, and the moment the lady steps from her chair to the chaise,
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
the postilions will crack their whips, and drive away like lightning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a romantic fellow!—How can you pos∣sibly imagine, that your hot-headed scheme to run away with this young lady can ever be executed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the justice of my cause, Jack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Justice!—Make that out, and my conscience will be easy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not her father's uncle, who was a good lawyer and cheated my father of three-fourths of his fortune, leave her near thirty thousand pounds?—Now, this is my reasoning—Sir Toby's uncle ran away with some thousands from my father, I shall run away with Sir Toby's daughter, this will bring the said thousands back to me again, with which I'll pay off old scores, strike a balance in my favour, and get a good wife into the bargain—There's justice for you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Justice with a vengeance! But why must Sir Toby be punished for the sins of his uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll ease your conscience there too—My mother, at my father's death, took me a boy to Sir Toby and my Lady, to solicit their kindness for me—He gave me half a crown to buy ginger-bread, and her Ladyship, who was combing a fat lap-dog, mutter'd—<HI>There was no end of maintaining poor relations.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not a qualm left—But did you really pass for a strolling player last summer, to have a pretence of being near her father's house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did, and as Polonius says, <HI>was account∣ed a good Actor.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could put that unaccountable frolic in your head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>To gain the favour of Sir Toby's family, as a strolling player, which I could not as a poor re∣lation—they are fond of acting to madness, and my plan succeeded; I was so alter'd they did not know me—they lik'd me much, came to a Bene∣fit, which I pretended to have, invited me to their house, and Miss met me privately, after I had played <HI>Ranger</HI> and <HI>Lothario.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, when a young lady's head is cram'd with combustible scraps of plays—she is always ready prim'd, and will <HI>go off</HI> (if you will allow me a pun) the very first opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I discovered myself to the young lady, and her generosity was so great, that she resolv'd to marry me to make me amends—there are refin'd feelings for you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, double refin'd!—she is more romantic than you, WILL—But did not you run a great risque of losing her, when she knew you was only a gentleman, and not a player?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read that letter, and tell me if my castles are built in the air? <STAGE>[Gives a Letter.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN <HI>(Reads.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I shall be with my Papa and Mama to see a Re∣hearsal at Drury-lane Playhouse on Tuesday morning; if my present inclinations hold, and my heart does not fail me, I may convince honest Ranger, what confidence I have in his honour.</HI>—Postscript.—<HI>If I don't see you then, I don't know when I shall see you, for we return into the country next week.—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O she'll run away with you most certainly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must not lose time then <STAGE>(looking at his watch.)</STAGE> I must go and take my stand, that the Deer may not escape me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I'll go and take mine, to help you to carry off the ven'son—This is very like poaching, WILL—But how will you get admittance into Drury∣lane Theatre?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very near being disappointed there, for unluckily the acting Manager, who scarce reach'd to my third button, cock'd up his head in my face, and said I was much too tall for a Hero—however I got the liberty of the scenes by desiring to rehearse Hamlet next week—But I hope to cross the Tweed with the fair Ophelia before that time,
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
and finish my stage adventures by appearing the first time in the character of a good husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Success attend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<L>—This is the day,</L>
<L>Makes me, or marrs, for ever and for aye!—</L>
<P>If I succeed, I shall be restor'd to my father's estate, drink claret, and live like a gentleman with the wife of my heart—and, egad, for aught I know, stand for the County.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If not—you must be confin'd to your little one hundred and twenty pounds a year farm, make your own cheese, marry the Curate's daughter, have a dozen children, and brew the best October in the Parish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which ever way fortune will dispose of me, I shall be always happy to see my friends, and never shall forget my obligations to thee, my dear Jack. <STAGE>[Shakes him by the hand.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERVIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well—let us away—we have too much business to mind compliments. <STAGE>[Exeunt severally.]</STAGE></P>

<HEAD>SCENE II. <STAGE>The PLAY-HOUSE.</STAGE></HEAD>
<STAGE>TWO WOMEN SWEEPING THE STAGE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRST WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come Betty, dust away, dust away girl, the Managers will be here presently; there's no lying in bed for them now, we are up early and late; all hurry and bustle from morning to night; I won∣der what the deuce they have got in their heads?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SECOND WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to get money, Mrs. Besom, to be sure; the folks say about us, that the other house will make them stir their stumps, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d they'll make us stir ours: If they are in motion, we must not stand still, Mrs. Besom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRST WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, girl, they have met with their match, and we shall all suffer for it—for my part I can't go thro' the work, if they are always in this plaguy hurry; I have not drank a comfortable dish of tea since the house open'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SECOND WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>One had better die, than be scolded and hur∣ried about as we are by the house-keeper; he takes us all for a parcel of Negers I believe: pray give us a pinch of your snuff, Mrs. Besom. <STAGE>[They lean upon their brooms and take snuff.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRST WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Between you and I, Betty, and our two brooms, the house-keeper is grown a little purse-proud; he thinks himself a great Actor forsooth, since he play'd the Scotch fellow, and the fat cook in Queen Mab.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>SECOND WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Quality spoils him too: why woman, he talks to them for all the world as if he was a Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRST WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall certainly <HI>resign,</HI> as the great folks call it in the News Paper, if they won't promise to give me the first Dresser's place that falls, and make our little Tommy a Page; what, woman, tho' we are well paid for our work, we ought to make sure of something when our brooms are taken from us,—'tis the fashion Betty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SECOND WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, right, Mrs. Besom, service is no inherit∣ance, and to be always doing dirty work, and to have no prospect to rest, and clean ourselves, is the curse only of us poor folks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRST WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You and I will drink a dish of tea together in comfort this afternoon, and talk over these and other matters—but mum—here's the Promp∣ter. <STAGE>[They sing and sweep again.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> HOPKINS, <HI>the Prompter.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, away with your brooms, and clear the Stage; the Managers will be here directly. <STAGE>[The sweepers hurry of.]</STAGE> Where are the Carpenters?—Carpenters!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A Carpenter above.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you want, Mr. Hopkins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do I want? Come down and set the Scenes for the new Burletta of Orpheus.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARPENTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>We an't ready for it, the Beasts are now in hand—they an't finish'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not finish'd the Beasts! here's fine work! the Managers and Author will be here directly, and nothing ready;—fie, fie, fie.—Saunders!—Saunders!— <STAGE>[Calls out.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SAUNDERS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAUNDERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here! here!—Zooks what a bawling you make, do keep your breath for your prompting, Master Hopkins, and not send it after me at this rate—I'm not deaf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But your men are, and asleep too I believe; I can't get a soul of 'em near me, 'tis ten o'clock, <STAGE>[looking at his Watch]</STAGE> and not a Scene prepared for the Rehearsal; 'tis I shall be blam'd, and not you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAUNDERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blam'd for what? 'Tis but a rehearsal, and of one Act only—wou'd you have us to finish our work, before the Poet has done his? Don't you know that Carpenters are always the last in a house; and yet you want us to get out of it, before the Author has cover'd in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may be as witty as you please; but the Managers will do as they please, and they have promis'd the Author to rehearse the first Act of his Burletta of Orpheus this Morning, as he pleases, with all the proper Scenes, Dresses, Ma∣chinery,
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
and Musick; so what signifies all our prating?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAUNDERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very little as you say—but damn all these new vagaries, that put us all upon our heads topsy versy—my men have sat up all night, and I have finish'd every thing but the Dancing Cows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless my heart, man, the Author depends most upon his Cows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAUNDERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Cows!—How came they to be his; they are <HI>my</HI> Cows;—these Poets are pretty fellows faith; they say I'll have a flying Devil, or a dancing Bear, or any such conundrum; why 'tis easily said, but who is to make 'em fly, and dance? ha, Mr. Prompter? Why poor Pill Garlick;—The Au∣dience applauds, the Author is conceited; but the Carpenter is never thought of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are bold truths, Mr. Saunders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAUNDERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then out with 'em, I say—great men spin the brains of the little ones, and take the cre∣dit of 'em.—Do you know how I was serv'd in our dramatic romance of Cymon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did your business well there, particularly in the last Scene.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAUNDERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what was the consequence? One fine gen∣tleman in the boxes said,—my master brought it from Italy;—<HI>No, damn it</HI> (says another, taking snuff) <HI>I saw the very same thing at Paris;</HI> when
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
you all know here behind the Scenes, that the whole design came from this head; and the execution from these hands,—but nothing can be done by an Englishman now a days, and so your servant, Mr. Hopkins— <STAGE>[Going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harkee Saunders,—the Managers have order'd me to discharge the man at the lightning; he was so drunk the last time he flash'd, that he has sing'd all the clouds on that side the Stage. <STAGE>[Pointing to the clouds.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAUNDERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I see it, and harkee—he has burnt a hole in the new cascade, and set fire to the shower of rain—but mum—</P>

<P>Make haste with your scenes, Saunders; so, clear the Stage, Mr. Hopkins, and let us go to bu∣siness. Is the extraordinary Author of this very extraordinary performance come yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet, Sir, but we shall be soon ready for him—'Tis a very extraordinary thing, indeed, to rehearse only one act of a performance, and with
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
dresses and decorations, as if it were really before an Audience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a novelty, indeed, and a little expensive too, but we cou'd not withstand the solicitations tha t were made to us; we shan't often repeat the same experiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, Sir,—'tis a very troublesome one, and the Performers murmur greatly at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>When do the performers not murmur, Mr. Hop∣kins?—Has any morning pass'd in your time with∣out some grievance or another?</P>
</SP>

<P>I have half a dozen now in my pocket for you. <STAGE>[Feeling in his pockets for papers.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O pray let's have 'em, my old breakfast— <STAGE>[Prompter gives 'em.</STAGE></P>
<P>And the old story—Actresses quarrelling about parts; there's not one of 'em but thinks herself young enough for any part; and not a young one but thinks herself capable of any part—but their betters quarrel about what they are not fit for, So our Ladies have at least great precedents for their folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The young fellow from Edinburgh won't accept of the second Lord; he desires to have the first.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where are the Ladies, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>They'll be here in the drinking of a cup of tea—I left 'em all at breakfast—Lady Fuz can't stir from home without some refreshment—Sir Ma∣caroni Virtu was not come when I left them; he
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
generally sits up all night, and if he gets up before two o'clock he only walks in his sleep all the rest of the day—He is perhaps the most accomplish∣ed connoisseur in the three kingdoms; yet he is never properly awake 'till other people go to bed;—however, if he shou'd come, our little perform∣ance, I believe, will rouse him—ha, ha, ha!—you understand me?—A pinch of cephalic only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have the honour of knowing him a little—Will Sir Macaroni be here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he promis'd, but he's too polite to be punc∣tual—You understand me?—ha, ha, ha!—how∣ever, I am pretty sure we shall see him;—I have a secret for you—not a soul must know it—he has compos'd two of the songs in my Burletta—An admirable musician—but particular—He has no great opinion of me, nor indeed of any body else, a very tolerable one of himself—and so I be∣lieve he'll come—You understand me? ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, Sir—But pray, Mr. Glib, why did not you compleat your Burletta—'tis very new with us to rehearse but one act only?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a sample, Mr. Patent, you may know the piece: if you approve you shall never want no∣velty—I am a very spider at spinning my own brains, ha, ha, ha! always at it—spin, spin, spin—you understand me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes—I make him play the devil there—I send him for some better purpose than to fetch his wife, ha, ha, ha!—Don't mistake me—while he is upon earth, I make him a very good sort of a man—He keeps a Mistress, indeed, but his wife's dead, you know—and were she alive not much harm in that—for I make him a man of fashion—Fa∣shion, you know, is all in all—You understand me?—Upon a qualm of conscience, he quits his mistress, and sets out for hell with a resolution to fetch his wife—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that too like a man of fashion, Mr. Glib?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir MACARONI.</SPEAKER>

<P>A very common one with you, my dear: We din'd late, Sir Toby cou'd not take his nap, and we came early to the House;—in ten minutes he fell fast asleep against the box door, his wig half off, his mouth wide open, and snoring like a Rhi∣noceros.</P>

<P>Dine, dine! Did you ever hear the like? you have no more feeling, Sir Toby, than your Peri∣wig.—I shall go distracted—the greatest curse of a poor woman, is to have a flighty daughter, and a sleepy husband.— <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Lady Fuz.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Sir TOBY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the greatest curse of a poor man, to have every body flighty in his family but himself. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> PATENT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, Mr. Glib,—the young Lady is gone off, but with nobody that belongs to us—'tis a dreadful affair!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is faith, to spoil my Rehearsal—I think it was very ungenteel of her to chuse this morning for her pranks; tho' she might make free with her father and mother, she shou'd have more man∣ners than to treat me so;—I'll tell her as much when I see her.—The second Act shall be ready for you next week.—I depend upon <HI>you</HI> for a prologue—your genius.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too polite, Mr. Glib—have you an Epilogue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a kind of Address here, by way of Epi∣logue, to the town—I suppose it to be spoken by myself, as the Author—who have you can repre∣sent me?—no easy task, let me tell you,—he must be a little smart, degageè, and not want assurance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Smart, degageè, and not want assurance—<HI>King</HI> is the very man.</P>

<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank, thank you, dear Mr. Patent,—the very man—is he in the house! I wou'd read it to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no!—since the audience receiv'd him in Lin∣co, he is practising musick, whenever he is not wanted here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard as much; and that he continually sets his family's teeth on edge, with scraping upon the fiddle.—Conceit, conceit, Mr. Patent, is the ruin of 'em all.—I could wish, when he speaks this Address, that he wou'd be more easy in his carriage, and not have that damn'd jerk in his bow, that he generally treats us with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll hint as much to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is my conception of the matter;—Bow your body gently, turn your head semicircularly, on one side and the other; and smiling, thus agreeably begin;</P>
<L>All Fable is figure—I your bard will maintain it,</L>
<L>And least you don't know it, 'tis fit I explain it:</L>
<L>The <HI>Lyre</HI> of our <HI>Orpheus,</HI> means your approbation;</L>
<L>Which frees the poor Poet from care and vexation:</L>
<L>Shou'd want make his mistress too keen to dispute,</L>
<L>Your smiles fill his pockets—and Madam is mute:</L>
<L>Shou'd his wife, that's himself, for they two, are but one;</L>
<L>Be in hell, that's in debt, and the money all gone;</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="49"/>
Your favour brings comfort, at once cures the evil,</L>
<L>For 'scaping Bum Builiffs, is 'scaping the devil.</L>
<L>Nay, <HI>Cerberus▪ Criticks</HI> their fury will drop,</L>
<L>For such barking monsters, your smiles are a sop:</L>
<L>But how to explain what you most will require,</L>
<L>That <HI>Cows, Sheep,</HI> and <HI>Calves,</HI> shou'd dance after the lyre,</L>
<L>Without your kind favour, how scanty each meal!</L>
<L>But with it comes dancing <HI>Beef, Mutton,</HI> and <HI>Veal.</HI></L>
<L>For sing it, or say it, this truth we all see,</L>
<L>Your applause will be ever <HI>the true Beaume de Vie.</HI></L>
