<L>Where custom's brought on some peculiar mode</L>

<L>If but deficient in a leg or eye,</L>
<L>Or, from misfortune, chance to look awry,</L>
<L>This <HI>maimed</HI> mimic, favour'd so by fate,</L>

<L>An arrant stroller, from the lord knows where,</L>

<L>A mimic's vile and despicable name;</L>
<L>There's no degree of acting, all allow,</L>
<L>So very puerile, infamous or low;—</L>
<L>For who e'er knew a mimic yet inherit</L>
<L>The smallest grain of genius or of spirit?</L>
<L>And has it not for ever been a rule</L>
<L>To join a mimic's name with that of fool?</L>
<L>The laughing-stock of candour and of fame,</L>
<L>A very monkey with a human name;</L>
<L>But joins not he then in a blockhead's cause,</L>
<L>That yields them favour, or that gives applause?</L>
<L>Each man of reason, and of judgment, must</L>
<L>Confess it neither laudable or just.—</L>

<L>But can't so truly imitate as he.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>To ape the manner of some better play'r,</L>
<L>An act ungen'rous, at the best, unfair;</L>
<L>Why should one actor villainously try</L>
<L>To damn another in the public eye?</L>
<L>Either by malice or by envy led,</L>
<L>To hurt his brother in his fame or bread?</L>
<L>When to the world 'tis evidently known,</L>
<L>He ne'er could boast a method of his own.</L>
<L>Such are a pest and scandal to the stage,</L>
<L>And who but <HI>F—te</HI> would any such engage?</L>
<L>Why don't the candid and insulted town,</L>
<L>In justice, cry these imitators down?</L>
<L>For all must own the stage was ne'er design'd</L>
<L>To point at this, or that, but all mankind.</L>
<L>E'en devotees must own the stage of use,</L>
<L>Where it don't leave <HI>instruction</HI> for <HI>abuse.</HI></L>
</LG>

<L>Lead by conceit, and fond of stage applause,</L>

<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>With face, nor voice, nor action, to commend,</L>
<L>Or win one single auditor his friend;</L>

<L>Long in <HI>Hibernia</HI> has he trod the field,</L>
<L>Where judgment oft to prejudice must yield,</L>
<L>And with no small indulgence and regard,</L>
<L>Tho' ev'ry night some noble part he marr'd.</L>
<L>See him return, declining, and in age,</L>
<L>Riding, his only Hobby-Horse, the stage,</L>
<L>And with a boyish zeal the toy embrace,</L>
<L>Tho' time with years has wrinkled o'er his face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of vulgar accent, and of bully's <HI>pink,</HI></L>
<L>A rolling sidle, with a <HI>knowing wink,</HI></L>
<L>Coarse and robust, who might perhaps engage,</L>
<L>Had he been cast on the <HI>Broughtonian</HI> stage:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="9"/><HI>P—l—r,</HI> self-confident, attempts to please,</L>
<L>In high-wrote parts of elegance and ease;</L>
<L>But like to him, who roll'd the stone in vain,</L>

<L>Yet must we own him some small share of praise,</L>
<L>When <HI>Bruin, Loader,</HI> and such parts he plays;</L>
<L>He's sure to please while in this line he steers,</L>
<L>For in such parts he still <HI>himself</HI> appears.</L>
<L>Then let him ever in that track remain,</L>
<L>Where he is sure, some small applause to gain,</L>
<L>And never more in gentlemen and beaux,</L>
<L>Disgrace the stage, the author, and the cloaths.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Barry,</HI> each season, might delight the town,</L>
<L>But that we've better actors of our own:</L>
<L>Yet think not <HI>Barry</HI> that I will disgrace,</L>
<L>Or mean to herd thee with the common race;</L>
<L>Thou art an <HI>Actor</HI> ev'ry judge must own,</L>
<L>And many years a fav'rite of the town,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="10"/>Till <HI>Powell</HI> chanc'd within thy walk to tread,</L>
<L>And pluck'd the blooming laurel from thy head:</L>
<L>Yet in <HI>Othello</HI> must each actor yield,</L>
<L>There even <HI>Garrick</HI> must give up the field,</L>
<L>And own thee for the part, by nature fram'd,</L>
<L>We think of <HI>Barry</HI> when <HI>Othello</HI>'s nam'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so thy son, when in each part he tries,</L>
<L>To copy thee, too oft from nature flies;</L>
<L>Yet will it faintly bear the name of fault,</L>
<L>To follow close the manners we are taught:</L>
<L>From thee, his ev'ry method he conceiv'd,</L>
<L>From thee, each beauty and each fault receiv'd,</L>
<L>Nor should we deem him destitute of art,</L>
<L>Did he with decency perform <HI>one</HI> part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O could my ardent, yet unwilling Muse,</L>
<L>Obtain one kind and plausible excuse,</L>
<L>And, without censure, be indulged to spare,</L>
<L>And overlook the errors of the fair—</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="11"/>But chaste <HI>Astrea</HI> guides my feeble hand,</L>
<L>And will not listen to my warm demand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest with a form of elegance and ease,</L>
<L>Two requisites that must for ever please,</L>
<L>Who for a season might perhaps engage,</L>
<L>When <HI>Yates,</HI> awhile, retires from the stage:</L>
<L>See <HI>Dancer</HI> now each high-rate part possess,</L>
<L>And try to picture virtue and distress,</L>
<L>But judgment seems to leave her in the dark,</L>
<L>Whene'er she aims to hit the doubtful mark.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With bold presumption, in despite of shame,</L>
<L><HI>J—ff—s</HI> attempts to join the rank of fame,</L>
<L>And void of judgment, attitude and speech,</L>
<L>She aims at characters above her reach;</L>
<L>When poor <HI>Alicia</HI> with distraction raves,</L>
<L>And calls for racks, for thunderbolts, and graves;</L>
<L>Did <HI>Cinderilla</HI> ever scold so well,</L>
<L>When in her airs she bid you <HI>go to h—ll?</HI></L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="12"/>When drove by love and passion to despair,</L>
<L>And having lost all hopes, begins to swear;</L>
<L>So sad <HI>Alicia,</HI> when by <HI>J—ff—s</HI> play'd,</L>
<L>A mere impetuous termagant betray'd.—</L>
<L>Forgive me <HI>J—ff—s</HI> that I speak my mind,</L>
<L>True satire never leaves one fault behind;</L>
<L>But since she's brought thy errors forth to view,</L>
<L>So shall she speak of thy perfections too.</L>
<L>In third-rate parts, where nature don't require</L>
<L>Such skill in action, or such force of fire,</L>
<L>When nor by pride nor by ambition led,</L>
<L>Content the paths of moderation tread,</L>
<L>There spite of censure shalt thou justly raise,</L>
<L>The smile of pleasure and the voice of praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See one in parts of wit and humour, strive</L>
<L>To catch the manner of a <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Clive</HI>;</L>
<L>For <HI>G—d—r</HI> the copyist betrays,</L>
<L>In ev'ry part of humour that she plays,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="13"/>And from her acting it is plainly shewn,</L>
<L>She likes their manner better than her own;</L>
<L>But such, a barren genius declares,</L>
<L>Who, having no invention, borrows theirs.</L>
</LG>

<L><HI>Oglevie</HI>'s pretty and genteel, I own,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behind appear a despicable race,</L>
<L>Without one single requisite or grace,</L>
<L>Beneath the notice of my honest Muse,</L>
<L>And, but to mention, would herself abuse.</L>
<L>Names both to genius and to fame unknown,</L>
<L>The needy stragglers of each country town;</L>
<L>Fit but to form some necessary group,</L>
<L>Or to compleat <HI>F—te</HI>'s miserable troop,</L>

<L>Break thro' the rules of genius and taste,</L>
<L>And lay, with ridicule, their kingdoms waste;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with his own, behold the mocker strive,</L>
<L>With some success, his <HI>Grub-street</HI> to revive,</L>
<L>And ev'ry season palls us with the same,</L>
<L>Till jaded patience sickens at his name.</L>
<L>Each man of candour, must in this agree,</L>
<L>His merit lies in inconsistency;</L>
<L>In art theatric, destitute of skill,</L>
<L>Yet makes a figure in a puffing bill;</L>
<L>In this judicious, 'tis a crafty snare,</L>
<L>To catch the vulgar, and to make 'em stare;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the promise of the joyous fun,</L>
<L>Away to <HI>F—te</HI>'s the herd unthinking run;</L>
<L>He gains his riches at the fool's expence,</L>
<L>Despis'd and shunn'd by ev'ry man of sense.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
<L>High on <HI>Parnassus</HI> wou'd he wish to ride,</L>
<L>And, unrestrain'd, the winged courser stride;</L>
<L>But is it not most evident to all,</L>
<L>The limping Bard has had a fatal fall.</L>
<L>A famous play-write wou'd he seem to be,</L>
<L>A very Phoenix to posterity.—</L>
<L>Grief! that his name must with his body die,</L>
<L>And all his bantlings with their father lie,</L>
<L>When, lacking his distortion and grimace,</L>
<L>Their sole protection and their only grace,</L>
<L>Spurn'd and detested in some wiser age,</L>
<L>Will never more get footing on the stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of these, the <HI>Minor,</HI> at the head we see,</L>
<L>Born at the time of his necessity;</L>
<L>When threaten'd by the horrors of a j—,</L>
<L>Was forc'd to hoist up ev'ry tatter'd sail;</L>
<L>And must have sunk had not the tortur'd <HI>Cole,</HI></L>
<L>(Who, like a Pirate, he unjustly stole)</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="16"/>Buoy'd him, when sinking, to the welcome shore,</L>
<L>And sav'd at once his vessel and his store.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Mayor of Garret</HI> next we bring to view,</L>
<L>Which we must own both laughable and new,</L>
<L>But candour will admit of no excuse,</L>
<L>Where she beholds such personal abuse.</L>

<LG>
<L>His <HI>Patron, Commissary,</HI> even all</L>
<L>His drolls, beneath this censure fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His <HI>Orators,</HI> a very hodge-podge see,</L>
<L>Made up of rubbish and absurdity,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="17"/>Cramm'd full of puns, of nonsense and parade,</L>
<L>With neither plot, or meaning to its aid:</L>
<L>And while to wit he makes a false pretence,</L>
<L>Or tries to introduce one line of sense;</L>
<L>With vain attempt he stammers at the task,</L>
<L>A very <HI>Midas</HI> in <HI>Apollo</HI>'s mask.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These grown quite thread-bare, and worn out with age,</L>
<L>Like <HI>F—te</HI> himself, a nuisance to the stage,</L>
<L>He's brought his <HI>Taylors,</HI> like a thrifty friend,</L>
<L>To botch their elbows and their linings mend;</L>
<L>With royal sanction force 'em on the town,</L>
<L>When they are sick of better treatment grown.</L>
<L>Did <HI>Smithfield</HI> e'er produce a bill so rare,</L>
<L>When <HI>Punchinello</HI> was the hero there?</L>
<L>Did ever <HI>Flockton</HI>'s tragedy excell?</L>
<L>Was ever shew-bill drawn up half so well?</L>
<L>Did ever Quack with such parade engage?</L>
<L>Not even <HI>R—k</HI> when he adorn'd the stage:</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="18"/>Did Taylor e'er with patchwork form a coat,</L>
<L>And without <HI>measure</HI> too, as <HI>F—te</HI> has wrote?</L>
<L>Did ever play-write exercise his quill</L>

<L>And stock'd, like him, with <HI>true poetic lore,</HI></L>
<L>Write such a <HI>Taylor</HI>'s <HI>tragedy</HI> before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Try'd, and condemn'd by th' indulgent town,</L>
<L>The father won't his new-born idiot own:</L>
<L>But fain wou'd bribe the bawdy muse its mother,</L>
<L>To lay the frightful monster on another,</L>
<L>To drop it at some door, or else to smother.</L>
<L>Yet if with close inspection you shou'd trace</L>
<L>The striking outlines of the infant's face,</L>
<L>The father's strong resemblance you'll behold,</L>
<L>As die to die, cast in the self-same mould.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As Epicurians with luxuriant waste,</L>
<L>Who lose at once their appetite and taste,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="19"/>And try to teaze the stomach ev'ry hour</L>
<L>With something sweet, or else with something sour;</L>
<L>Or when the rake is quite indiff'rent grown,</L>
<L>Sated with all the pleasures of the town;</L>
<L>See him from place to place with transport fly,</L>
<L>In search of pleasure and variety.</L>
<L>When sick of <HI>high life</HI> he begins to grow,</L>
<L>He tries to find a relish in the <HI>low</HI>;</L>
<L><HI>F—te</HI> next arises to his vacant mind,</L>
<L>For there he's sure the coarsest fare to find;</L>
<L>Tho' coarse, yet light, and easy to digest,</L>
<L>Nor hurt the head before it meets the breast.</L>
<L>No heavy sentence to perplex the brain,</L>
<L>No searching morals on the mind remain,</L>
<L>But like the froth, dissolving in the taste,</L>
<L>And, ere it meets the lip, begins to waste:</L>
<L>While in our ears he dins the mighty pother,</L>
<L>It enters one, and hurries out at t'other.</L>
