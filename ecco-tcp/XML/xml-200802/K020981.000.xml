as his own to make its appearance! But the character of Writer, which the late ex∣treme abuse of that talent has not at all con∣tributed to illustrate, does not invite power∣fully enough to the producing one's self pro∣fessedly in that light to the Public.</P>
<P>The sole view of the author in the liberty he is now risking, is only by way of appeal to YOU, MADAM, whether the character of complete domestic virtue, attempted in that of <HI>Philodamus,</HI> has been faithfully copied from nature. Of this, MADAM, it is impos∣sible, any one can be so good a judge as YOURSELF, who have constantly before YOUR eyes the most perfect example of it, that, perhaps, ever actually existed: an example,
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
whose lustre still to increase, YOU are con∣tented, MADAM, to suffer YOUR own great and amiable qualities, which in any other part of the world would have burst out un∣rivalled, to rank, in this, but in the second place. The loss is compensated in the great share it is allowed, MADAM, YOU have in the very virtues to which YOU yield the pre∣eminence. They are such, that had they been exercised only within the walls of a pri∣vate family, they could not have failed of winning their way abroad into the general esteem of mankind. What universal adora∣tion must they then command, when it is no∣thing less than the most extended dominion upon the globe, which, in reality, proves to be this vast family, under the most vigilant
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
and indulgent of parents; and receives to its utmost boundary the effects of that fa∣therly tenderness and benevolence, which seem to have been first put in practice in their more immediate connections, in order to learn from experience how they might afterwards be best applied, and diffused, to the most di∣stant!</P>
<P>If, in return, MADAM, our prayers to Heaven are but short, it proceeds from no deficiency in our gratitude; we think we have fulfilled every dictate of duty and love, when we have ardently petitioned, that YOU, MADAM, may long continue to share, adorn, and reward, all the virtues that can render human nature amiable and respectable.</P>

<L>Whate'er the cause, the change is rather sudden.</L>
<L>'Tis not so long since you foreran the sun.</L>
<L>Clamour and bustle ever waken'd with thee.</L>
<L>When I inquir'd, sometimes it was Philippus</L>

<L>Your other studies too, I find, lie fallow.</L>

<L>In banishment at Corinth, for the love</L>
<L>I knew your sister bare her, I took hither.</L>

<L>That love gives reputation to her judgment.</L>
<L>Had but our crabbed rough philosophers</L>

<L>I see no point in which they yield to us.</L>
<L>Their apprehension's quicker, and their reason</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11"/>By forms less fetter'd, their expression clearer;</L>
<L>They seek no shelter from authorities,</L>
<L>Nor do they strive to veil their ignorance</L>
<L>In terms of art, as we do: then their gentleness</L>
<L>Smooths off the rugged points of argument,</L>
<L>Melting contention into pleasantry.</L>
<L>Discourse, such as Euphemia's and my sister's,</L>
<L>Conceiv'd by sense, and harmoniz'd by beauty,</L>
<L>Reaches the heart, while it informs the mind,</L>
<L>Softens and civilizes all our ways.</L>

<L>Not to examine whither, but too often,</L>
<L>These over-<HI>civilizing</HI> freedoms tend,</L>

<L>Trifling neglects may chill its tender growth,</L>

<L>Thank you, Apronius: You arriv'd before us?</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RUBRIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Reposing after the fatigue of journey.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>APRONIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Fatigue! why, his sedan steps with that smoothness,</L>
<L>So stuff'd with cushions, that he rather seems</L>
<L>To float upon the air, than move on earth.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SESTIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You know his delicacy, to what height</L>
<L>He has improv'd that science, whose perfection</L>
<L>Consists in picking cause of discontent,</L>
<L>Fatigue, and disappointment, where we gross ones,</L>
<L>Thanks to our want of taste, meet satisfaction.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RUBRIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, he was sour'd but at the last relay,</L>
<L>Because the country round about could furnish</L>
<L>Only some two poor bushels of fresh roses,</L>
<L>Hardly enough to arm his queasy sense</L>
<L>Against eight sturdy Cappadocian slaves,</L>
<L>Who melted as they bore along his litter.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>APRONIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, are your purses cramm'd? You have not serv'd</L>

<L>Ask Rubrius there, he is an able workman;</L>
<L>I'm but a 'prentice, and can only pilfer.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RUBRIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nothing to boast of, yet not much amiss.</L>
<L>The legate kept t' himself king Nicomedes,</L>
<L>As a right royal dish, and only serv'd</L>
<L>To his own mess, where we were not to feed:</L>
<L>And he has pick'd him to the bone, nay suck'd</L>
<L>His very marrow. Irus might be richer</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>APRONIUS.</SPEAKER>

<L>I like your prudence; while you fleec'd the court,</L>

<L>Ensur'd their love! say you? ensur'd their love!</L>
<L>If plague, war, famine, shipwreck may be lov'd,</L>

<SPEAKER>APRONIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>In little, as at Rome,</L>
<L>The great are vicious openly, 'bove fear</L>
<L>Of the law's rod, which humbly bows before them;</L>
<L>As your mine-searchers say their hazle twig</L>
<L>Stoops to the latent gold beneath. Again,</L>
<L>The middle rank is vicious out of pride,</L>
<L>Copying the larger manners of their betters,</L>
<L>Ev'n till they swell their narrowness to bursting.</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="34"/>The trading sort are honest, their indentures</L>

<L>I am not half the villain of this Verres,</L>

<L>Conscience, put in her caveat to a deed,</L>

<STAGE>Enter EUPHEMIA.</STAGE>
<L>Why art thou here, Euphemia? to unman me?</L>
<L>Now, that I've born the parting of a father,</L>
<L>With all I have of steadiness, art thou come</L>
<L>To rob me of that last of vanities,</L>
<L>Which cowards sometimes reach, the dying resolute?</L>
<L>I'm young, am born to dignity, and affluence;</L>
<L>Have health untainted, and th' esteem of friends.</L>
<L>These I could have resign'd, yet be myself,</L>
<L>And mock the phantom death. What is a world</L>
<L>That one must ask the leave of Rome to live in?</L>
<L>But when I view thy beauties, which I quit</L>
<L>Purchas'd, but unpossess'd; there lies the agony,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUPHEMIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I came to steel thy breast, and not to melt it</L>

<L>And why regret to die? since we have lov'd,</L>
<L>And have enjoy'd already, never doubt it,</L>
<L>All that is keen and exquisite in love.</L>
<L>The rest deserves small notice. Be like me.</L>

<SPEAKER>PHILIPPUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>What dost thou mean, Euphemia? thou alarm'st me.</L>
<L>There's a determination in thine eye,</L>

<L>More than the axe that waits me. Oh! dismiss</L>
<L>Thy desp'rate thought whatever. Live, Euphemia,</L>

<L>In this dread hour it was my consolation,</L>
<L>Epicrates had lent thee noble shelter</L>
<L>From all the storms that yet might buffet life.</L>
<L>Oh! harbour there, and drop the social tear,</L>

<L>Till slow-pac'd time, nay, habitude of sorrow</L>
<L>Induce satiety of itself. Who knows?</L>

<L>Yes, and be comforted; dry up my tears;</L>
