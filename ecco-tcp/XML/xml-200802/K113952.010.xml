<HEAD>OCTOBER. AN ODE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE naked grove now shivers at the blast,</L>
<L>While his green mantle on the ground is cast.</L>
<L>Bleak are the prospects of the widow'd trees,</L>
<L>Mourning their faded glories in the breeze;</L>
<L>Hark! where the barns conceal their yellow stores,</L>
<L>Echo repeats the labour of the floors!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like a young thresher, on the neighbouring hill,</L>
<L>Her mimic strokes the distant woodlands fill;</L>
<L>Now in the Scorpion, Phoebus rules the day,</L>
<L>And Summer's painted foliage fades away,</L>
<L>Shorn is the verdure of the hazel-shade,</L>
<L>While the gale brushes o'er the auburn glade;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, ye autumnal beauties, mourn the time</L>
<L>Mispent in prudery, while you pass'd your prime!</L>
<L>And, ere the the plum is of its blue bereft,</L>
<L>Be frugal of the golden hour that's left;</L>
<L>Yon stately pine late triumph'd in its shade,</L>
<L>But mark, in Autumn, how its honours fade!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>The skies, prophetic of stern Winter, wear</L>
<L>A sadder robe—and nipping is the air;</L>
<L>Now to the thirsty root the sap descends,</L>
<L>Tho' still the bough, with golden fruitage, bends.</L>
<L>Still the hale jasmine boasts its white and green,</L>
<L>And annuals triumph o'er the withering scene;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now teem the cyder-vats with apple-wine,</L>
<L>And emulate the nectar of the vine;</L>
<L>While ripe Pomona labours to produce</L>
<L>A cooling beverage for the Summer's use,</L>
<L>The fervor of the heated swain to cool,</L>
<L>While the proud dog-star holds his tyrant-rule;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Will Myra from her plighted promise range?</L>
<L>Shall Love's affections with the weather change?</L>
<L>No; tho' around dismantled forests pine,</L>
<L>And the gay fields their velvet gloss resign,</L>
<L>Reverse of Autumn, she shall never fade,</L>
<L>But ardent Truth embower us with its shade.</L>

<LG>
<L>THE bosom of earth is all matted with leaves,</L>
<L>The honours of Autumn decay;</L>
<L>Brown Ceres no longer exhibits her sheaves,</L>
<L>To the golden-eyed monarch of day.</L>
<L>With dissonant guns hills and vallies resound,</L>
<L>The swains thro' the coppices rove;</L>
<L>The partridges bleed on the arable ground,</L>
<L>The pheasants lie dead in the grove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The coats of the hedges look languidly green,</L>
<L>The swallows relinquish the meads;</L>
<L>Rude winter approaches with horrible mien,</L>
<L>The flowrets give place to the weeds.</L>
<L>The sun too is lazy, and slumbers abed,</L>
<L>As loathing so early to rise:</L>
<L>When risen, how dim looks his vapoury head!</L>
<L>How faint he illumines the skies!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more on the poles hang the clustering hops,</L>
<L>Or form a magnificent shade;</L>
<L>No more on their skirts shine the showery drops,</L>
<L>For Autumn, their nurse, is decay'd.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>The gale that was wont to approach me so kind,</L>
<L>Grows sharp, and flies hastily by,</L>
<L>To give me sweet kisses no longer inclin'd,</L>
<L>It bids the tear start from my eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! see, while I speak, from the gun's levell'd aim</L>
<L>Death pierces the birds of the air!</L>
<L>Ye rovers, will nothing your conduct reclaim,</L>
<L>And move your hard bosoms to spare?</L>
<L>No, nothing—ye cry with unanimous voice,</L>
<L>While ridicule falls from your tongue:</L>
<L>Ye think not, ye cruel ones, as ye rejoice,</L>
<L>How once the poor innocents sung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To others such barbarous sports I resign,</L>
<L>And fly to my Florimel's arms;</L>
<L>Her sanctified love shall be totally mine,</L>

<L>The tuneful black-bird whistling to his mate,</L>

<L>The life that they suppos'd the Gods to lead,</L>
<L>You would not chuse to undergo.</L>
<L>Jupiter's business, day and night,</L>

<L>The women had so great a share,</L>
<L>That their absurdities and cravings</L>

<L>A Phoenix, daughter of the Sun,</L>

<L>Some stately, others light and gay,</L>

<L>To think abstractedly, to reason deep,</L>
<L>And to declaim, 'till all the world's asleep.</L>
<L>These students from the tower saw our young folks,</L>
<L>Our bold adventurers under sail,</L>

<L>So much as wings.</L>
<L>Whatever is essential to our make</L>
<L>We soonest learn, and seldomest mistake.</L>

<HEAD>THE ADVICE OF AN OLD SPANIEL.</HEAD>
<L>A Certain dog of middling birth,</L>
<L>Frolicksome and full of play:</L>
<L>Even in the height of all his mirth,</L>
<L>Delicate, as well as gay:</L>
<L>With far more feeling for his friend,</L>
<L>Than they could either taste or comprehend.—</L>
<L>Being thrown into the world betimes,</L>
<L>Betimes discover'd it was all a cheat,</L>
<L>Yet not so dangerous for odious crimes,</L>
<L>As odious for malice and deceit,</L>
<L>Oft, when he meant to have amus'd</L>
<L>His friends with a conceit, or harmless jest,</L>
<L>By many he was snarl'd at and abus'd,</L>
<L>And slighted even by the best.</L>
<L>Oft, when half-starv'd, he found a bone,</L>
<L>Or something hid,</L>
<L>Instead of eating it alone,</L>
<L>As others did,</L>
<L>He ran to share his daily bread,</L>
<L>Unsought;</L>
<L>With those that were much better fed</L>
<L>Than taught,</L>
<L>His daily bread they seiz'd;</L>
<L>And drove him from their mess,</L>
<L>More disappointed and displeas'd</L>
<L>With their ingratitude than his distress.</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="44"/>It is a maxim amongst dogs,</L>
<L>When they have the address and skill,</L>
<L>To slip their collars and their clogs,</L>
<L>And leave their friends that use them ill.</L>
<L>To avoid anxiety and strife</L>
<L>Tray was resolv'd to try a country life.</L>
<L>A country dog, I think,</L>
<L>Is exactly like a country squire,</L>
<L>They both are only fit to sleep and stink</L>
<L>By their own fire,</L>
<L>And when awake are only good</L>
<L>To yelp and halloo in a wood.</L>
<L>Their joys,</L>
<L>And conversation are the same,</L>
<L>'Tis all a clamour and a noise,</L>
<L>And all the noise and clamour about game.</L>
<L>Three words compose their whole vocabulary,</L>
<L>A fox, a hare, and a fine scenting day,</L>
<L>Whether they are serious or merry,</L>
<L>'Tis all they have to say:</L>
<L>In short they never are so entertaining,</L>
<L>As when they're fast asleep, or feigning.</L>
<L>To quit such friends as these,</L>
<L>One would not grieve,</L>
<L>Tray parted from them with great ease,</L>
<L>Without so much as taking leave,</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="45"/>Consults his grandsire, by profession,</L>
<L>A spaniel;</L>
<L>For judgment and discretion,</L>
<L>A perfect Daniel.</L>
<L>Benign and mild;</L>
<L>He heard his grandson's grievances, and smil'd.</L>
<L>Grandson, said he, I do conceive,</L>
<L>If you had known the world, and how things go,</L>
<L>But half as much as you believe;</L>
<L>Which is twice as much as I believe you know;</L>
<L>You would not have complain'd,</L>
<L>That dogs behave to one another,</L>
<L>When they are unchain'd,</L>
<L>Like every creature to his brother.</L>
<L>Say, dupe of a rash confidence and trust,</L>
<L>If you lie open and unguarded,</L>
<L>Is it not just,</L>
<L>That vigilance should be rewarded?</L>
<L>'Twas neither Nature's call,</L>
<L>Nor my instruction,</L>
<L>To trust your friends at all;</L>
<L>Much less, to trust them to your own destruction:</L>
<L>A painful and severe attention,</L>
<L>Is but a necessary fence,</L>
<L>To every dog of sense,</L>
<L>Against deceit and circumvention,</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="46"/>A task from which you hop'd to be reliev'd</L>
<L>By trusting to your friends:</L>
<L>You are deceiv'd,</L>
<L>Acting as much as they for your own ends,</L>
<L>All the world knows,</L>
<L>That friendship's a meer sound;</L>
<L>A sound that hardly can impose</L>
<L>Upon a puppy hound.</L>
<L>Nature is not to blame,</L>
<L>Flatter'd by cunning, indolence invented</L>
<L>That foolish name,</L>
<L>By which so many fools are circumvented.</L>
<L>Happiness you'll seldom find,</L>
<L>Unless you learn</L>
<L>To have no weighty interest, or concern,</L>
<L>With those of your own kind.</L>
<L>Unless you learn, (if it is not too late)</L>
<L>That they are neither worth your love nor hate,</L>

<HEAD>THE COPPER FARTHING.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MRS. PENNINGTON.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See her character in Poet. Cal. vol. 7. p. 30.</NOTE></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>HAppy the boy, who dwells remote from school,</L>
<L>Whose pocket or whose rattling box contains</L>
<L>A copper farthing! he nor grieving hears</L>
<L>Hot cheese-cakes cried, nor savoury mutton-pies;</L>
<L>But with his play-mates, in the dusk of eve,</L>

<L>Where, mindful of the sport that joys his heart,</L>
<L>Marbles or chuck, he instantly begins,</L>
<L>With undissembled pleasure in his face,</L>
<L>To draw the circle, or to pitch the dump:</L>
<L>While I, confin'd within the hated walls</L>
<L>Of school, resounding with a clamorous din,</L>
<L>By still more hated books environ'd, I,</L>
<L>With tedious lessons and long task to get,</L>
<L>My dismal thoughts employ; or wield my pen</L>
<L>To mark dire characters on paper white:</L>

<L>Uses the sage, a chiromancer hight,</L>
<L>Sprung from Egyptian king, and swarthy race,</L>
<L>Amenophis or Ptolemy, when he,</L>

<L>Thus while my lingering hours I joyless spend,</L>

<L>Th' expected punishment for task ungot?</L>
<L>Aghast I stand, nor fly to covert bench,</L>
<L>Or corner dark, to hide my hapless head;</L>
<L>So great my terror, that it quite bereaves</L>
<L>My limbs the power to fly; slow he ascends</L>
<L>Th' appointed seat, and on his right-hand lies</L>
<L>The bushy rod, compos'd of numerous twigs,</L>
<L>Torn from the birchen tree, or bending willow,</L>
<L>Which to the flesh of idle boys portends.</L>
<L>For the neglected task, a poignant smart;</L>

<L>With haughty step, and watchful eye askance,</L>

<L>To which his maw insatiate forebodes</L>
<L>Certain destruction, while behind or bush</L>

<L>Here from the sea the melting breezes rise,</L>

<L>Can the New-River's artificial streams,</L>

<L>Where stately colonnades are flank'd with trees:</L>
<L>On a whole country looks the master down</L>
<L>With pride, where scarce five acres are his own.</L>
<L>Yet Nature, tho' repell'd, maintains her part,</L>
<L>And, in her turn, she triumphs over art;</L>
<L>The hand-maid now may prejudice our taste,</L>
<L>But the fair mistress will prevail at last.</L>
<L>That man must smart, at length, whose puzzled sight</L>
<L>Mistakes in life false colours for the right;</L>
<L>As the poor dupe is sure his loss to rue,</L>
<L>Who takes a Pinchbeck guinea for a true.</L>
<L>The wretch, whose frantic pride kind fortune crowns,</L>
<L>Grows twice as abject when the goddess frowns;</L>
<L>As he, who rises when his head turns round,</L>

<L><PB N="97" REF="99"/>Then love not grandeur, 'tis a splendid curse;</L>
<L>The more the love, the harder the divorce.</L>
<L>We live far happier by these gurgling springs,</L>

<L>The stag expell'd the courser from the plain;—</L>
<L>What can he do?—he begs the aid of man;</L>
<L>He takes the bit, and proudly bears away</L>
<L>His new ally,—he fights, and wins the day:</L>
<L>But, ruin'd by success, he strives in vain</L>
<L>To quit his master, and the curb again.</L>
<L>So from the fear of want most wretches fly,</L>
<L>But lose their noblest wealth, their liberty;</L>
<L>To their imperious passions they submit,</L>
<L>Who mount, ride, spur, but never draw the bit.</L>
<L>'Tis with your fortune, Spence, as with your shoe,</L>
<L>A large may wrench, a small one wring your toe:</L>
<L>Then bear your fortune in the golden mean—</L>
<L>Not every man is born to be a Dean;</L>
<L>I'll bear your jeers if ever I am known</L>
<L>To seek two cures, when scarce I merit one.</L>
<L>Riches, 'tis true, some service may afford,</L>

<L>We never talk of this man's house or vill,</L>
<L>Or whether Lepos dances well or ill:</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="116"/>But of those duties which ourselves we owe,</L>
<L>And which 'tis quite a scandal not to know:</L>
<L>As whether wealth or virtue can impart</L>
<L>The truest pleasure to the human heart:</L>
<L>What should direct us in our choice of friends,</L>
<L>Their own pure merit, or our private ends:</L>
<L>What we may deem, if rightly understood,</L>
<L>Man's sovereign bliss, his chief, his only good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean-time my friend, old Cervius, never fails</L>
<L>To cheer our converse with his pithy tales:</L>
<L>Praise but Arellius, or his ill-got store,</L>
<L>His fable thus begins: "In days of yore</L>
<L>A country mouse within his homely cave</L>
<L>A treat to one of note, a courtier, gave;</L>
<L>A good plain mouse our host, who lov'd to spare</L>
<L>Those heaps of forage he had glean'd with care;</L>
<L>Yet on occasion would his soul unbend,</L>
<L>And feast with hospitality his friend:</L>
<L>He brought wild oats and vetches from his hoard;</L>
<L>Dried grapes and scraps of bacon grac'd the board:</L>
<L>In hopes, no doubt, by such a various treat,</L>
<L>To tempt the dainty traveller to eat.</L>
<L>Squat on fresh chaff, the master of the feast</L>
<L>Left all the choicest viands for his guest,</L>
<L>Nor one nice morsel for himself would spare,</L>
<L>But gnaw'd coarse grain, or nibbled at a tare.</L>
<L>At length their slender dinner finish'd quite,</L>
<L>Thus to the rustic spoke the mouse polite:</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="117"/>' How can my friend a wretched being drag</L>
<L>' On the bleak summit of this airy crag?</L>
<L>' Say, do you still prefer this barbarous den</L>
<L>' To polish'd cities, savages to men?</L>
<L>' Come, come with me, nor longer here abide,</L>
<L>' I'll be your friend, your comrade, and your guide.</L>
<L>' Since all must die that draw this vital breath,</L>
<L>' Nor great nor small can shun the shafts of death;</L>
<L>' 'Tis ours to sport in pleasures while we may;</L>
<L>' For ever mindful of life's little day.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These weighty reasons sway'd the country mouse,</L>
<L>And light of heart he sallied from his house,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to travel with this courtly spark,</L>
<L>And gain the city when securely dark.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now midnight hover'd o'er this earthly ball,</L>
<L>When our small gentry reach'd a stately hall,</L>
<L>Where brightly glowing, stain'd with Tyrian dye,</L>
<L>On ivory couches richest carpets lie;</L>
<L>And in large baskets, rang'd along the floor,</L>
<L>The rich collation of the night before.</L>
<L>On purple bed the courtier plac'd his guest,</L>
<L>And with choice cates prolong'd the grateful feast;</L>
<L>He carv'd, he serv'd, as much as mouse could do,</L>
<L>And was his waiter, and his taster too.</L>
<L>Joy seiz'd the rustic as at ease he lay;</L>
<L>This happy change had made him wondrous gay—</L>
<L>When lo! the doors burst open in a trice,</L>
<L>And at their banquet terrified the mice:</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="118"/>They start, they tremble, in a deadly fright,</L>
<L>And round the room precipitate their flight;</L>
<L>The high-roof'd room with hideous cries resounds</L>
<L>Of baying mastiffs, and loud-bellowing hounds:</L>
<L>Then thus the rustic in the courtier's ear;</L>
<L>' Adieu! kind sir! I thank you for your cheer:</L>
<L>' Safe in my cell your state I envy not;</L>
<L>' Tares be my food, and liberty my lot!"</L>

<HEAD>A PARODY ON THE CITY AND COUN∣TRY MOUSE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Country vicar in his homely house,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with his lot, and happy in his spouse,</L>
<L>With simple diet, at his humble board,</L>
<L>Once entertain'd the chaplain of a lord;—</L>
<L>He gave him (all he could) a little fish,</L>
<L>With sauce of oysters, in no silver dish;</L>
<L>And, for the craving stomach's sure relief,</L>
<L>The glory of Old England, rare Roast-beef,</L>
<L>Horse-radish and potatoes, Ireland's pride;</L>
<L>A pudding too the prudent dame supplied:</L>
<L>Their cheering beverage was a pint of port</L>
<L>(Tho' small the quantum) of the better sort;</L>
<L>But plenty of good beer, both small and stout,</L>
<L>With wine of elder to prevent the gout.</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="119"/>The vicar hop'd, by such a various treat,</L>
<L>To tempt his scarf-embellish'd friend to eat;</L>
<L>With nicest bits provok'd his guest to dine,</L>
<L>He carv'd the haddock, and he serv'd the wine:</L>
<L>Content his own sharp stomach to regale</L>
<L>With plain, substantial roast-meat, and mild ale.</L>
<L>Our courtly chaplain, as we may suppose,</L>
<L>At such old-fashion'd commons curl'd his nose;</L>
<L>He tried in vain to piddle, and, in brief,</L>
<L>Pish'd at the pudding, and declin'd the beef;—</L>
<L>At length, their homely dinner finish'd quite,</L>
<L>Thus to the vicar spoke the priest polite:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' How can my brother in this paltry town</L>
<L>' Live undistinguish'd, to the world unknown?</L>
<L>' And not exalt your towering genius higher,</L>
<L>' Than here to herd with country clown—or squire;</L>
<L>' Stunn'd with the discord of hoarse cawing rooks,</L>
<L>' The roar of winds, the dissonance of brooks,</L>
<L>' Which discontented thro' the valley stray,</L>
<L>' Plaintive and murmuring at their long delay.</L>
<L>' Come, come with me, nor longer here abide;</L>
<L>' You've friends in town, and I will be your guide:</L>
<L>' Soon great preferment to your share will fall,</L>
<L>' A good fat living, or perhaps—a stall.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These weighty reasons sway'd the vicar's mind—</L>
<L>To town he hied, but left his wife behind:—</L>
<L>Next levee-day he waited on his Grace,</L>
<L>With hundreds more, who bow'd to get a place;</L>
<L><PB N="118" REF="120"/>Shov'd in the croud, he stood amaz'd to see</L>
<L>Lords who to Baal bent the supple knee,</L>
<L>And doctors sage he could not but admire,</L>
<L>Who stoop'd profoundly low—to rise the higher.</L>
<L>So much of ermine, lace, beaus, bishops, young and old,</L>
<L>'Twas like a cloud of sable edg'd with gold:</L>
<L>By turns his Grace the servile train addrest,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with a smile, or in a whisper blest.</L>
<L>Sick of the scene, the vicar sought the door,</L>
<L>Determin'd never to see London more;</L>
<L>But, as his friend had pleas'd the hour to fix,</L>
<L>First went to dinner to my Lord's at six;—</L>
<L>He knock'd—was usher'd to the room of state,</L>
<L>(My Lord abroad) and dinner serv'd in plate;</L>
<L>Which, tho' it seem'd but common soup and hash,</L>
<L>Was really callipee and callipash,</L>
<L>(The relicks of the gaudy day before)</L>
<L>What Indians eat, and Englishmen adore;</L>
<L>With bright champaign the courtier crown'd the feast,</L>
<L>Sooth'd his own pride, and gratified his guest:</L>
<L>All this conspir'd our Stoic to controul,</L>
<L>And warpt the steady purpose of his soul—</L>
<L>When lo! the cry of fire creates amaze—</L>
<L>" The next house, Lady Riot's, in a blaze"—</L>
<L>Aghast the vicar stood, in wild affright,</L>
<L>Then briefly thus address'd the priest polite:</L>
<L>" Adieu, my friend—your state I envy not—</L>
<L>" Beef, liberty, and safety be my lot."</L>

<L>IF you, dear sir, will deign to pass a day</L>
<L>In the fair vale of Orpington and Cray,</L>
<L>And live for once as humble vicars do;</L>
<L>On Thursday let me see you here by two.</L>
<L>Expect no niceties my plates to foul,</L>
<L>But Bansted mutton, and a barn-door fowl.</L>
<L>My friends with generous liquors I regale,</L>
<L>Good port, old hock, or, if they like it, ale;</L>
<L>But if of richer wine you chuse a quart,</L>
<L>Why bring, and drink it here—with all my heart.</L>
<L>Plain is my furniture, as is my treat,</L>
<L>For 'tis my best ambition, To be neat.</L>
<L>Leave then all sordid views, and hopes of gain,</L>
<L>To mortals miserable, mad, or vain;</L>
<L>Put the last polish to th' historic page,</L>
<L>And cease awhile to moralize the age.</L>

<L>Bemus'd in wine the Bard his duns forgets,</L>

<HEAD>SALT WATER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY A GENTLEMAN OF THE NAVY.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>O! sure the greedy wretch is pent</L>
<L>In endless chains of deep damnation,</L>
<L>Who first to plague us did invent</L>
<L>The cursed art of navigation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When to the wind we spread our sails,</L>
<L>Upon the pathless ocean strolling,</L>
<L>Cramm'd in a tub, stuck full of nails,</L>
<L>Like Regulus we die with rolling.</L>
</LG>

<L>A plague upon the nauseous brine,</L>
<L>What benefit receive we from it?</L>
<L>Unless with rank disease we pine,</L>
<L>And use it for a purge or vomit.</L>

<LG>
<L>While Eve in innocence did dwell,</L>
<L>Her water in fresh rills descended,</L>
<L>But soon as she to folly fell,</L>
<L>The violet stream with brine was blended.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The race of men in antient times</L>
<L>Were bent on rapine, and on slaughter,</L>
<L>When heaven, incensed at their crimes,</L>
<L>Decreed their deaths, and sent salt water.</L>

<L>And when those heavy judgments past</L>
<L>On Aegypt, for her plagues renowned,</L>
<L>Salt water was reserv'd the last,</L>
<L>And Pharoah and his host were drowned.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When we who now are turn'd to fish,</L>
<L>And with the scurvy grown all scaly,</L>
<L>And made for shark a curious dish,</L>
<L>While over-board we're tumbled daily:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May you who on the land abide</L>
<L>Our element to mourn us borrow,</L>
<L>Let fall of tears a briny tide,</L>
<L>Salt water is the mark of sorrow.</L>
