<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here comes her father. I don't suppose he had much hand in it; for so he had his afternoon's nap in quiet, he was always for letting things go as they would. So, Master Easy, you have consented, I find, to marry your daughter to another, after pro∣mising me over and over, that nobody should have her but me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife desired me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your mind is strangely altered, farmer Easy. But do me one piece of justice however—tell me, who is it you intend for your son-in-law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a rich one I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you have broke your word, and all for the lucre of gain. And, pray now, don't you expect to be hooted out of the village?</P>

<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they're a vile pack of wretches, and I'll get away from them as soon as I can. Go on, go on—let me know all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in a passion, child, so I don't regard what you say: but I think I should have been out of my wits to have refused Mr. Steady, the rich Quaker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is it he then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, he that you are steward to; he that does so much good all about; and he that gives a portion every May-day to a damsel, as a reward for her sweet∣heart's ingenuity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same. You have seen the nature of it—that villager who can boast of having done the most in∣genuous thing, claims a right to demand a farm, containing sixty acres, rent free for seven years, and a hundred pounds to stock it, together with whatever maiden he chooses, provided he gains her consent: and it is a good custom; for the young men, who formerly us'd to vie with one another in the feats of strength, now, as I may say, vie with one another in feats of understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so he is to marry your daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things are as I tell you. And for that purpose he has taken Gillian into his own house, had her taught music, and to say the truth, she is a different thing to what she was when you saw her last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is indeed! for when I saw her last, she told me, that all the riches in the world should never make her forget me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But since she has changed her mind; and it so falls out, that to-morrow is May-day, you would do well to study some ingenuous thing, and get this portion for a more deserving damsel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, farmer Easy; her using me ill is no reason why I should do any thing to make me angry with myself; I swore to love her for ever, and I'll keep my word, tho' I see she has broke hers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do what you please, I must be gone.</P>

<P>How can you talk so, Floretta? I won't tho', and none of them shall make me; they all frigh∣tened me, by saying it was a bad thing not to obey my parents, and so I consented to marry this Qua∣ker-man; but there's a wide difference between mar∣rying him and forgetting Lubin.</P>

<P>Oh, lord! I am sick at the thoughts of being a fine lady! But what's the reason, Floretta, that my friends want to make me so unhappy? I am sure I'd do any thing rather than vex them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you'll excuse my rudeness?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't perceive thee guilty of any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not; but I made bold to ask, if I might not trouble your worship about a little affair, con∣cerning my being sadly ill used.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak freely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there's a covetous old hunks, and like your worship, that because he is rich, would fain take away a young woman that I was to be married to, without her consent or mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has the old hunks, thou speakest of, the consent of her friends?</P>

<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have no consent to give, and please you.</P>

<P>And why, I pray thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because as I take it, if any body gives a thing, 'tis not theirs any longer; and they gave me their con∣sent long ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou speakest the truth. But what wouldst thou have me do in this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, please you, Sir, I have often heard it said of your worship, that there were three things you'd never suffer in our village, if you could help it—The maidens to go without sweethearts—the industrious without reward—and the injured without redress—and to be sure it made me think, that if you were once acquainted with the rights of this affair, you would not suffer it go on; for, says I, set in case it was his worship's own concern, how would he like to have the young woman taken away from him, that he is going to marry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There thou saidst it</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>

<P>Do thou direct it; thou knowest to whom it is to be given.</P>

<P>Friends and neighbours, it hath been my study, since I first came among you, to do whatever might procure me your love and esteem. I have instituted a custom, the salutary effects of which I view with great gladness; and each is well entitled to the re∣ward he has received.

<P>'Tis my belief, 'tis time.

'Tis an old saying, That 'tis as precious as gold; and yet we are always throwing it away. And, your worship, as a proof that nothing can be done without it, if the old gentleman we were a talking about to-day, had not had the opportunity of my absence, he could not have run away with a certain young damsel.</P>
