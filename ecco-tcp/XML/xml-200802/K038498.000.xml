<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE discontinuing the acting of a Play, that has been well re∣ceived by the Town in general, at a Time when it might have gone on, makes it necessary to give some Account of what has past since the first Night of its Re∣presentation, and of the Motives that made the Author put a Stop to its Run.</P>
<P>A Report having been maliciously raised, and industriously spread all over the Town, that the Play was a Party Play, and supported by the Court, and therefore to be opposed, Numbers of Persons came into the House with an Intent, (as the Term is) to damn it at all Events.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
Thus determin'd, they took hold of every little Slip that,
<Q><L>—Aut Incuria fudit</L>
<L>Aut humana parum cavit Natura—</L></Q>
and were very clamorous: However, the Play having had a fair Hearing, went off with infinitely more <HI>Applause</HI> than <HI>Blame.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Night the particular Things objected to, being taken out, the Play was acted from Beginning to End, without one single Mark of Displea∣sure in the Audience.</P>
<P>The Third Night it went off in the same Manner, to the most numerous and splendid Audience that could be seen.</P>
<P>The Fourth Night a Set of about eight or ten young Fellows went to the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-House in the Piazza, and declared publickly that they came purposely to damn the Play, and would not leave the Play-house till they had compassed their Ends. The same De∣claration they repeated when in the House to some Gentlemen that wero there,
<PB REF="7"/>
Friends (but unknown to them) to the Author.</P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. <HI>Ryan</HI> coming on to speak the <HI>Prologue,</HI> they began their Up∣roar, but were soon silenced, and the <HI>Prologue</HI> was heard with Applause: The Play beginning, they began again, and were so loud that Mr. <HI>Ryan</HI> ac∣quainted them, that as he could not ima∣gine there was any thing in the Play they could except against, he was appre∣hensive he had the Misfortune to dis∣please them. Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> then came on, and told them he found the House was divided, and as the Majority was for hearing the Play, he hop'd those who were not, would go out. The House on that were unanimous, and cry'd, <HI>Turn them out, Turn them out,</HI> but they saved the Audience the Trouble of doing it, and retired under the general Hiss of every Person then present: After which the Play went on without the least Disturbance.</P>
<P>The Author having reflected that Malice, tho' it could do the Play no Hurt, might affect Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> by keeping Per∣sons
<PB REF="8"/>
from the House, who have no great Relish for Noise, chose rather to dis∣continue the further acting of the Play, and to refer himself to the Judgment of every impartial Reader, to whom he freely commits it, being determin'd as frankly to acknowledge any real Fault found with it, as to justify it, if censur'd without Reason.</P>
<P>The Author cannot conclude, without declaring how much he thinks himself obliged to every Actor for the Care taken in the acting it, and more particularly to those who having the principal Parts to perform, had an Opportunity to exert themselves, as they did, in the most sa∣tisfactory Manner.</P>

<LG>
<L>WHEN Love's taught Dangers animate the Stage,</L>
<L>Your Ears, ye Fair! let the soft Scenes engage:</L>
<L>Let each bright List'ner mark the Wiles we show,</L>
<L>And catch dumb Caution, from the pictur'd Woe.</L>
<L>—Guiltless of Farce, to Night, the meaning Player</L>
<L>Courts not your Laughter—but, alarms your Care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Man, the Deceiver! veils his cruel Art:</L>
<L>And skreens himself, within th' attempted Heart.</L>
<L>There, to ungenerous Empire, climbs, ere long:</L>
<L>Help'd by the Confidence, he means to wrong!</L>
<L>—This, to detect, we act his Falshood o'er:</L>
<L>And, the Deluder, known, betrays no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such, the best Business of the Comick Muse!</L>
<L>Love has a thousand Lessons, to infuse:</L>
<L>—Not always Lightness shou'd ungrace the Scene.—</L>
<L>To laugh at Folly, but indulges Spleen.</L>
<L>Coxcombs, and Fops, in harmless Error stray:</L>
<L>And trip, undangerous out of Passion's Way.</L>
<L>Misers, and Sots, less, Mirth, than Pity, move:</L>
<L>And, Dullness brings an Antidote, for Love.</L>
<L>—But, there's a Traitor, arm'd, in am'rous Mail!</L>
<L>Born, to attempt, and, fashion'd to prevail!</L>
<L>Disguis'd in Softness—by deep Arts endear'd:</L>
<L>And, always dang'rous—because, never fear'd.</L>
<L><PB REF="10"/>
Him, in our Glass of Life, to Night, we show:</L>
<L>Nor stoop the condescending Scene, too low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence, if too grave, for Comedy, we seem,</L>
<L>Think us but suited to our serious Theme.—</L>
<L>—'Tis no light Loss, when charming Woman falls!</L>
<L>On our Defence, the Sex's Merit calls.—</L>
<L>We, who the Pictures of a World impart,</L>
<L>Neglect not what concerns its fairest Part.</L>
<L>All Danger, to that Sex, thus frankly shown,</L>
<L>At the same Time, does Honour to our own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor let Neglect of Laughter move the Pit,</L>
<L>To dread, in Consequence, a Dearth of Wit.</L>
<L>Unmeaning <HI>Mirth</HI> may live, in empty Noise:</L>
<L>But, solid <HI>Converse</HI> swells our softer Joys.</L>
<L>—Once, in an Age of Tumbling, Dance, and Song,</L>
<L>Suppose not two short Hours of Sense, too long!</L>
<L>—Not even the Fashion <HI>Change</HI> of <HI>Taste</HI> denies!</L>
<L>Oft MERRY here,—let us be, sometimes—WISE!</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AARON HILL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>BAulk'd, as I am,—my Heart's best Hope, mis∣carried,</L>
<L>Try'd, cast, and sentenc'd to be hang'd;—that's married!</L>
<L>Ere I'm turn'd off, I think it but my Duty,</L>
<L>To warn, in my last Speech, fast-falling Beauty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First, <HI>Maidens!</HI> let my sad Example teach ye,</L>
<L>To put no Trust in Man—'till he can reach ye.</L>
<L>For, shou'd you strive, too near, his Strength so mighty,</L>
<L>That, down you come, at once—and, then—Good Night t'ye!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, O ye <HI>Wives!</HI> trust not in Beauty's Merit:</L>
<L>But, to your Body's Influence, add your Spirit.</L>
<L>With your Eye's Lightning, mix a Tongue, that thunders:</L>
<L>Believe me—Love, so double-arm'd, works Wonders!</L>
<L>—Yet, if nor Charms, nor Eloquence, can save ye;—</L>
<L>But, your good Man will break the Faith he gave ye:</L>
<L>Be you before-hand with him.—That Reproving</L>
<L>Will make him own there's Guilt, in too light loving.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And for you, <HI>Widows,—</HI>you're too wise, sor teaching,</L>
<L>But, suff'ring Malefactors must be preaching.</L>
<L><PB REF="12"/>
So, take one Word of Council, in your Calling:</L>
<L>Tho' you're too brave, I know, to fear a Falling.</L>
<L>—From your old Yoke, set free, admit no new one,</L>
<L>Unless with some, poor, brisk, young, kind, and true one.—</L>
<L>The conscious Youth, long, mindful of your Favour,</L>
<L>Will make up all Defects, with good Behaviour.—</L>
<L>Loth, that his Wants his Gratitude shou'd smother;</L>
<L>What he can't bring you, one Way—comes another.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, now, good People! what I've, more, to say t'ye,</L>
<L>Shou'd be, a doleful <HI>Tune,</HI> and <HI>sigh,</HI> and <HI>pray</HI> t'ye.</L>
<L>—But, doleful Tunes, of late, are grown so common,</L>
<L>They move more Sorrow, than a dying Woman!</L>
<L>And, Sighs, and Prayers, are best, when made in private,</L>
<L>As you all know, who have good Ends to drive at.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What shall I do, then?—shall I hang, and tarry?</L>
<L>Or, bold, in saving Faith, go on, and marry?</L>
<L>'Tis, both Ways, bad!—But, I've, at once, bethought me,</L>
<L>Of a sweet Lesson, dear Revenge has taught me!</L>
<L>—I'll stay, and see Sir <HI>Harry</HI> in his Fetters:</L>
<L>Nor be so rude, to swing, before my Betters.</L>
<L>Pass but his Honey-moon of Sunshine Weather,</L>
<L>And He, and I, may, then, go, hang, together!</L>

—Nay, nothing but Curiosity. You seem, of late, con∣trary to your usual Custom, to be very particular to her, among other Ladies; and I own I love her so, that I cou'd wish our Friendship were cement∣ed yet closer. That's all.</P>

<P>Well, Sister, to deal frankly with you, as much as I can love, I love <HI>Angelina.</HI> She has Youth, Beauty, good Sense, and Fortune; but so have a thousand other Women.

<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do assure you, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> I thought the Time long on many Accounts. But will you forgive me an abrupt Question? Was not that your Sister that left you, as I came up? I got a Glimpse as she shot along, and thought it was that dear Figure, whose Resemblance, still fresh in my Memory, during my Retirement, ever kept me Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was indeed. But she was not well dress'd enough; she wanted a Pin, or a Patch, I suppose, or some such important Matter. A foolish Maxim in the Sex, <HI>Ned,</HI> always to ap∣pear to the best Advantage before Marriage. It makes the Difference but too sensible after, when we see and feel the Neglect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reason of her going was however kind. But tell me, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> are you a little more reconcil'd to old <HI>England</HI> than you was, when we last parted? Have our pretty Country∣women made any Impression on your Heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Heart, <HI>Ned,</HI> was ever soft, and will, like Wax, as easily take as lose an Impres∣sion. But I'm such a Convert to my Country∣women's Charms, that I think they want nothing but a little more Gaiety and Life to make them as much more agreeable, as they are already more beautiful than those of other Nations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is something. I am pleas'd to see you can do Justice to your own Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythee, dear <HI>Ned,</HI> for once lay aside thy Partiality to thy own Country. Look upon thyself as a Foreigner. That done, observe our charming Countrywomen, at a Visit or a Play; see how they sit with their Hands rivetted to their
<PB N="5" REF="20"/>
Fans, and plac'd just in the Centre of their pretty Persons; motionless, unless it be to display the Furbelows of that little Engine, and as silent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are the first that ever complain'd of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd have 'em speak in every Gesture. Give me a Woman, whose very Air and Manner speak, and are a tacit Confession that they have—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have—what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? Why as much Inclination as Power to charm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you found none such? How did Sir <HI>Peregrine</HI>'s Lady prove? I think I left you hot in that charitable Pursuit. I don't expect to find you so now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, <HI>Ned,</HI> it wou'd be odd if you did. A beautiful Woman is like a well-wrote Book, every Leaf you turn over, at first affords new Pleasure; but when you're forc'd to read it daily, from one End to the other, you'll find but little Inclination to begin again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're witty, Sir. But is this Argument only to hold good for the Men? Have not Women the same Plea for Inconstancy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Friend! That it was but so! How happy should we be! But there's a Fatality in the Way of loving, of the two Sexes, that renders both miserable. Enjoyment lessens our Passion, and increases theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you was successful? And now, like a restless Tyrant, despise your Conquest, and seek for new Acquisitions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

Our Neighbourhood gave me many Opportunities of seeing her, which I improv'd, till at last I found myself tenderly beloved. I caught the Infection too, and doated on her; promised Marriage; which I intended to execute. The Saints in Hea∣ven, and her Maid, were Witnesses to my Vows. <HI>Lucia</HI> thought the Security good, and delivered into my Arms the loveliest Person they had ever held. With Joy we often met, and with Reluc∣tance parted, cursing the Day that came so soon, and oblig'd me to disappear, before any of the Family was up, but the trusty Maid. Much about this Time Sir <HI>Peregrine</HI> came down to <HI>Lucia</HI>'s Fa∣ther, fell in Love with the Daughter, ask'd her of him, and obtain'd her. She wou'd have declar'd our Affair, to avoid a Match she hated, and to have been mine, as I had promis'd; but having no great Stomach to the Match, and finding she wou'd not suffer in her Reputation by the Affair, I advis'd her to accept the Gentleman's Offer, in such a Manner, that she saw she must, or be un∣done. I own 'twas unkind.—She did not see me for a long Time after she was married, and, I believe, never wou'd, had not her Husband's Affairs call'd him abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, not content with forcing this fond Creature to give her Vows to a Man she hated, you forc'd her too, to violate those very Vows, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Ned,</HI> not so fast. I did all I cou'd, indeed, but she was obstinate, and never wou'd. It was in vain to alledge former Intima∣cies; she wept, and answer'd me with her Husband, her Husband, at ever Word. Is it not odd, <HI>Ned,</HI> a Woman shou'd be constant to a Man she hates, and refuse one she loves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may seem so to you. But People that think there is something beside Passion, that ought to be listen'd to, may, perhaps, be of a different Opinion. But now you mention her Husband, pray what's become of him?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir.—And the generous, good∣natur'd Creature, left his Widow all he had: If he had not, it would have been a heavy Tax on me.</P>

<P>'Twas generous indeed. I heard he was a worthy Man.</P>

<P>Pr'ythee, be serious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, in few Words,—her Husband, Sir <HI>Peregrine</HI>'s private Affairs, oblig'd him to go to <HI>Leghorn.</HI> These very private Affairs oblig'd him to leave that Place soon after, and make a short Voyage. Short, indeed, it was; for the Ship and Crew were all cast away on the Coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI> near <HI>Sallee.</HI> Like a prudent Man, he had made his Will before he went, and thus my Lady <HI>Traffick</HI> became a young and rich Widow. Now, <HI>Ned,</HI> you know a Woman can't hold out for ever against a Man she loves. Her Husband's Death left her without any Excuse, and her own Heart pleaded strongly for me. Then she hop'd too to make me more than ever fond, and like a fond Fool marry her. She took the wrong Method.—However our Commerce, which now I am very sorry for, was renewed again; again she trusted me, and was again deceiv'd.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, faith. And when I grow other∣wise, it must be for a very bad Reason. Why, Sir, to shew you what a Man of Business I am, I have at present an honourable Affair upon my Hands, which does not hinder me from amusing myself with my Mistress's Woman.</P>

<P>Ay, Sir, she wants for nothing. Then, Sir, I have, which with all my Soul I wish I had not, this Lady <HI>Traffick,</HI> as troublesome as a Dun. when a Man has nothing to pay.—But this does not hinder me from laying close Siege to another, who is on the Point of dropping into my Arms, Young and pretty as an Angel.</P>

<P>But can this Angel vary her Form?</P>

<P>Time enough for that yet. She's a Virgin. O <HI>Ned,</HI> there's something so charming in the first Struggles of a young and yielding Heart!—We quarrelled last Night, which I am confident will advance my Affair more than the most favourable Opportunity wou'd.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, you are an Adept in the Mys∣tery of Love. For my Part, I have but one Heart, and find one Mistress fills it quite up. Your Sister, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> holds me at full Play. I came to Town once more, in order to try my Fate.</P>

<P>And pray, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> how d'you intend to dispose of this Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, <HI>Ned,</HI> I am a little puzzled as to that, I have not Ill-nature enough to for∣sake her, nor Complaisance enough to forsake my Pleasures for her. She knows my Love is at its lowest Ebb; and that there is little left but Grati∣tude to keep it alive. And since that Time, what have I not suffer'd? To give you a Sketch of my Life with her, Each Day I see her, and each Day am regularly entertain'd with the same Reproaches.—I hear myself accus'd as Author of her Ruin; my own Words, Words, which at certain Mo∣ments in my first Passion's Heat, or when com∣pell'd by the fond Question, <HI>Do you love, and will you ever love me?—</HI>Words, which, indeed, I may have said, quoted back and retorted as so many Proofs of my Inconstancy. In short, my Temper's quite broke, quite wearied out with struggling. Neither Company nor Friends divert me. Were I to consult her Humour, I should never be from her. When I but miss a Day, there's no End of her upbraiding. A Recapitulation of all that has pass'd, from the first Moment of our Acquaintance, as surely follows, as such Recapitulation is follow'd by Tears, Threats, Passion, Hope, Despair, each in their Turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>There 'tis again. If a Man once fool's away an idle Hour in soft Caresses and fond Blan∣dishments, in the Beginning of an Amour, or when the Blood boils high, he must be ever after toying, ever sooling, or there is no Quiet for him, and he must expect to be baited and reproach'd as I am.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Traf.</SPEAKER>
<P>False and scandalous Accusation! made only to colour your violated Faith, and Breach of Truth. You accuse us only, when you know yourselves are false.

As if those little Marks of Fondness and Affection that Lovers give and take, were a Disgrace to your superior Natures, and a Weakness scarce tolerable in ours. Curse on your false, dissembling Arts! You can employ those little Marks of Fondness and Affec∣tion; you can fool and toy away not Hours, but Days and Months, when you'd inspire us with a Passion for you. How well you act, when you'd seduce us! You are more fond and foolish even than we; or seem so, the better to deceive us. You fawn like Spaniels, and lick the Foot

<P>Your Empire settled o'er us, you shew yourselves. First you begin to languish, and grow tir'd in our Company; you want Diversion to relieve your Minds. As we love you with un∣feign'd Affection, and prefer your Pleasures to our own, we bear your Absence, in that View, with Satisfaction. That Point gain'd, you go on far∣ther. A Coolness succeeds. Our Beauties fade in your Eyes, want Edge for your pall'd Appetites: Faintly you deny it; and, to excuse yourselves, you tell us, Love's a Passion that ought not to make the Business but the Amusement of Life, and shou'd be never suffer'd to grow serious.</P>

<P>Our Minds affected by such new and unknown Doctrine, we reproach you. Our Reproaches, arm'd with Truth, perplex and gaul you, and at last beget Aversion in you; which once born, never dies. Your Aversion draws new Reproaches from us, and our Reproaches strengthen your Aversion; 'till at last, Love long since fled, Pity forsakes you too.

<P>Betters! What does the Baggage mean? Because my Master does her the Honour to take a little Notice of her, she thinks herself exalted a De∣gree above one of her own Rank.—Betters, Mrs. <HI>Betty!</HI> Why, I don't know, but methinks there's no such great Difference between us. I'm Valet to a very fine Gentleman, and Inheritor of all his Vices, you Waiting-Woman to a very fine Lady, and Possessor in full of all her Follies and Affectations. So that as our Rank in Life is equal, and our Qualifications pretty much the same, I own I want Eyes to see the wide Difference you wou'd put between us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Fellow says true. A good genteel
<PB N="34" REF="49"/>
Person. But then he's a Footman. Foh, how rank that smells! A Girl that has once tasted of Genti∣lity, can never sink down to the mottly Tribe; at least it ought to be the last Stake she plays.—Well, Sir, will you be pleas'd to tell your Master I have something to communicate to him.</P>
</SP>

<P>Come, come, Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> for once hear Truth, however disagreeable it may sound. What can you propose by being acquainted with a Gen∣tleman? If you mean no Harm, 'tis playing with edg'd Tools. You may hurt yourself, tho' but in Play. And if you shou'd, as insensibly you may go too far, the utmost you can pretend to rise to, is to be his—And for how long Time? A Month, two, three, a Year, suppose. At the End of which he leaves you, perhaps, with Child. Return to Service! No. You're above it. You change Masters till you've serv'd all the Town, and your Wages are Infamy and Diseases.—Nay, Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> 'tis wholesome Physick, and, if you take it, may make you well again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I cou'd cry for Madness. But I don't care; I'll never mend, when I'm told of my Faults in so gross a Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whereas, if you give Way to a Passion with one of equal Rank with you, his Designs, at least, are honourable. He will not presume above what he may reasonably expect. He'll court you for a Wife; and if he has deserved well of his Master, and you of your Mistress, they'll make you a Present that may enable you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>To set up a Chandler's Shop, and live up∣on selling of Half Pennyworth's of Small-Beer,
<PB N="35" REF="50"/>
and Quarters of Ounces of Tea. Foh, What a Life! But before we arrive to this charming State, this envied Period of Servitude; what Dangers do we not run thro'? If our Masters or Mistresses discover we are married, Warning is immediately given, and we must provide for ourselves. If they know nothing of it, we find so many Excuses to get out to see each other, and stay so long when we are sent on Errands, that we are sure to be turn'd away. And then farewel all Hopes of this noble Settlement. We live in a Garret, breed like tame Rabbits, wear out the Cloaths we got in Service, and having no Money to buy more, stink in coarse Rags, and mutually curse each other, to the melo∣dious Concert of half a Dozen squaling Brats about our Ears.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> you may be as witty as you please, but give me leave to tell you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not done yet. I heard you out, now hear me. I'll grant you, a Chambermaid loses her Character the other Way; but if she has any Beauty, and Wit to make the most of it, it will go hard if she do not make it worth her while. And Money, Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> you know, hides a great many Faults. Then the Elegancies of Life wipe away a Spot in one's Character; or at least make one bear with it. Good Cloaths, Meat, Drink, Diversions! To rise from a low State to an Affluence of Fortune and Pleasure, at least to her. Oh! the Joy's not to be describ'd, one must feel it. After all, one can at last match with one's Equal. He'll be glad to have us, if we bring our Welcome with us. He won't be so nice as to refuse a handsome Suit of Cloaths, because it has been a little soil'd; and we may, perhaps, be enabled to carry on a genteeler Profession than a Chandler's Shop.</P>

Some, indeed, even then you might deceive. But you are more cunning than to trust to that. You make your Conquest sure, then shew yourself.

Ill Usage must be return'd with Cheerfulness; nay, we must not sigh nor weep, tho' our Hearts break. Should we or sigh or weep, he flies, he will not see us; or, if he condescends to see us, 'tis not to look with Pity on our Weakness or our Suffer∣ings, 'tis to behold 'em with a stony Heart, and barbarously urge us with unrelenting Obstinacy, that our Passions growing too violent for our weak Frames, we sink beneath the killing Weight.</P>

<PB N="41" REF="56"/>
we can't confine our Thoughts to what we suffer with you; that indeed might cure us. But we let 'em loose, and they bring back to our charm'd Senses former Scenes of Joy. There, there we fall. Our Passions catch the Alarm; we wake from present Misery, by reflecting on past Happiness. Our Passions prompt us to believe, that Happi∣ness may still return.

<SPEAKER>Lady Traf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. But what does all this signify to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have Patience, Mem, and you shall know. The Intimacy Sir <HI>Harry</HI>'s Sister has with my Lady, brought him first to our House. As he is a very agreeable Gentleman, it was not long before I perceiv'd my Lady grew uneasy and restless, averse to Company, which she us'd to like, and, in short, never pleas'd but when she was talking of him, or else in his Company. Not to detain you longer, he makes honourable Love to her, and I believe 'twill be a Match. Now, Mem, if Sir <HI>Harry</HI> is engag'd to you, 'tis base in him to pretend Love to my Lady, and deceive you. As I hate false Men, and could not bear to be deceiv'd myself, I came to acquaint you how wicked a Man he is, and give you a Caution against his flattering Tongue.</P>

<P>IF I forgive him, I wish I may be deceiv'd by every Man I trust to; and that's the greatest Curse that could happen to me. So far 'tis well. I'm secure of Lady <HI>Traffick;</HI> if I can but work upon my own Lady as well, I may make 'em all quarrel, and then I may, perhaps, get him to my∣self. I'm sure he likes my Person, and that is the best Hold. People may talk of Sense and Virtue, and all that. They may be good in a formal Wife, but in a Mistress, let her but have an agreeable Temper, and a pretty Person.—Heyho! I'm melancholy all of a sudden. Wou'd Sir <HI>Harry</HI> was here. Yet I ought not to wish that neither, for one kind Word from him, wou'd make this Letter drop out of my Hands, and at once destroy my Plot. Bless me, he is here!

<P>Rather, as if I were flying from one. Sure nothing's so detestable as a Man of Sense, that pretends to be a Lover. Love is a quite different Thing in him, than in other Men.</P>

<P>Nay, then we must change the Discourse. How d'you think the tedious Creature entertain'd me at the Auction this Morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>So, this is changing the Discourse.—Nay, the Lord knows. I'm sure, in the Humour you are, 'twas fifty to one any thing he said cou'd please you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why by expressing his Pleasure at the beautiful Appearance the Company made, by re∣marking the Variety of Tastes, that reign'd in the Choice of Cloaths, and by drawing Conclusions from the Singularity of some Dresses, of the Sense and Understanding of their Wearers. The Wretch did not say a Word of me all the while, and scarce look'd at me. But I was even with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I don't question that. But how pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in the Midst of these wise Remarks, which he thought I took as much Pleasure to hear, as he did to make, Sir <HI>Lively Brainless</HI> came run∣ning from the other Side of the Room, and desir'd me to look at a young Lady that stood close by me. Madam, said he, wou'd you believe it? This young Lady I met at the other End of the Room, and thought her one of the most beautiful Creatures I ever saw; but when she came and stood by you, she appear'd to me so eclips'd and dim'd, that I came to see if it was the same Person. I did not know her again, I vow to gad. Lord, Sir <HI>Lively,</HI> said I, you've so pretty a Way of laughing at one, that one can't be angry. This drew a
<PB N="49" REF="64"/>
Repartee from him, and that another from me; so that <HI>Heartly,</HI> I suppose, finding our Dialogue too long, very civilly took his Leave, and I very civilly let him go. Ha, ha—</P>

<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Barbarous Creature! How cou'd you use him so?</P>

<P>I don't know what to make of this, tho'.—Nay, Madam, if you won't take what I say for granted, I have done. I never prove any thing; I only assert.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>You differ very much, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> from the fine Gentlemen of the Age, who seem not to

think Sense in a Woman so essential to the mar∣ried State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Experience, Madam, is the Mother of true Judgment. Those fine Gentlemen you mention, are either too young to judge right, or too much hurried by their Passions, which For∣tune enables 'em to indulge to Excess, to follow what is right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must, however, give a thinking Wo∣man some Pain, to find even Men of Sense can't value them as they ought, till they are sated with Pleasures, and have lost their Relish for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Education of our Sex, so diffe∣rent from that of yours, gives us such early and unbounded Liberties, that a thinking Woman must look with Indulgence on our early Failings; especially, since we are the principal Sufferers, in neglecting real Happiness to follow the Phan∣tom.</P>
</SP>

<P>Come, come, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> this Apology ought not to pass for the sensible Part of your Sex, who stray in full Daylight.</P>

<P>Forgive me, Madam, if I detain you

against your Will. Let me be still more plain; talk to your Sense, and not your Sex. There never was any Person, how wild soever he may have been, but in his more serious Moments has form'd some Scheme of Happiness for Life. How often, tho' perhaps you'll not believe it, have I pleas'd myself that the Time would come when I should arrive at that happy Calm that fits one for such a Life. Hitherto my Joys, however great, have been imperfect. Reflection will be heard, and lead, soon or late, to a right Way of Acting. What I have been, I would have every body forget; as much as I myself shall avoid henceforth to be. What I shall be, depends not on myself. The Scheme of Happiness I now propose—</P>

<P>The meanest of your Sex! Profane Crea∣ture! Can Love harbour in mean Breasts?</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what Love you talk of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Love I talk of, Madam, is that Passion that fills us with generous Sentiments in Behalf of the Person we like; and if the meanest Artisan, in Proportion to his Sense and Under∣standing, feels such Sentiments, he feels Love in its greatest Delicacy.</P>

<P>Sir, you seem too interested in your Wish, to be capable of those generous Sentiments you re∣quire in a Lover.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>If to wish to possess a Woman, who, to an agreeable Person, joins a superior Understanding and Temper, fram'd to please and to be pleas'd, be to be interested, I own I am so, and glory in it.

<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Heartly,</HI> you remember the Story I told you this Morning. You'll explain it to my Sister. I have no Time to lose now. That Lady is now with <HI>Angelina;</HI> Revenge has push'd her to destroy my Hopes in her, whom I had just before brought to confess a Regard for me. I found a growing Passion in every Word and Look—but fear shall never see it more. She, by this, knows all my former foolish Engagement; and I know her Virtue is too delicate ever to consent, were there but the Shadow of a Promise extant against me.</P>
</SP>

<P>O Friend, I cannot stir. My Con∣science weighs me down; I can never face that in∣jur'd, guiltless Woman, not dare behold the awe∣ful Severity of <HI>Angelina</HI>'s Looks.

If he denies a Word of what I say, let me be still more wretched, if possible, than I am.—Sir—I cannot look at him, and speak,—yet I must.—Sir, 'tis to you I speak; answer me. Did you not rob me of my Innocence, under the solemn Promise of Marriage? Were not our Vows exchang'd, and mutually plighted to each other? Did you not break these Vows, al∣most
<PB N="64" REF="79"/>
assoon as made, and force me (tho' my Tears and faithful Love to you spoke my Reluctance) to give myself to another? Did you not even tempt me to violate the very Vows which you compell'd me to make? I was not quite so lost to Virtue: Can you deny all this?—No. Your Silence justifies the Charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see too plain it does, I want no other Proof.—Madam, believe I feel your Wrongs, as if they were my own. Compassion is the Glory of our Sex, and well becomes its Softness.—'Tis now too late, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> to deny I had har∣bour'd some favourable Sentiments of you.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't indeed. Your Sentence, Ma∣dam, is just. The Wrongs I've done this Lady, whose only Fault was loving me too tenderly, merit the severest Punishment. You have it in your Power, and do inflict it. I've made one miserable, (wou'd there were but one) 'tis just I shou'd be so myself. <HI>Lucia,</HI> you seem to be surpriz'd to see me with so calm a Look. Know, that I'm asham'd of my inhuman Usage of you, and will make any Amends within my Power. You sought Revenge, you have it, and I blame you not.

<P>These Words, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> at another Time, had made me the happiest of my Sex; but now they serve to make me the most miserable.

<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call it not so. 'Twas I deceiv'd you. You believ'd me lawfully yours, and indulg'd a Fondness that well became your Youth and Passion. Add not to your unhappy Fate, a Crime you were not guilty of.</P>

<P>Hold, Sir. True Happiness must be with∣out Alloy. I shall never think of this Lady, but I shall look upon myself as a Bar to her Peace of Mind. And tho' thro' Excess of Goodness, which very Goodness shou'd confound you, she can give up her Happiness to procure that of the Man by whom she's ruin'd, I never can consent, and never will. Your Reason, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> points the Path you have to follow, mine, which I am to avoid.</P>

<P>The Sentiment, Madam, is kind and generous. But my Misery or Happiness must henceforward depend upon myself alone; and I, Madam, will never be his.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Liv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no great Matter.—You must not think of having me, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir <HI>Lively,</HI> why you are not mar∣ried!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Liv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not positively. But it looks very like it. Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> do you know my Uncle's rich Ward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Ward!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Liv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, his Ward. What dost start at?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mark your Brother's Surprize? I'll be hang'd if this Spouse of Sir <HI>Lively</HI> is not the other mention'd just now. <STAGE>[Aside to Laet.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>So—And you have been there already?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Liv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that I have. Egad, I flew thither, Hark'ee, she's a fine Woman, faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and you saw her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>How he questions him! <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Liv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay. But such a Sight! I found her all in Tears, just recover'd from a fainting Fit. I sup∣pose her Father's Letter, with the News of her sudden Happiness, disorder'd her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> I fancy I cou'd give a better Reason for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Liv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, egad, I never minded that. I made my Speech; and 'twas a pretty one, upon my Honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you, Sir.</P>
<STAGE>[Turns away.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Liv.</SPEAKER>
<P>So cold! Perhaps, Sir, you are some secret Rival?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith, Sir: And to prove that I have no Pretension to her, if this Lady, since you have told her she must not think of you, were in∣clin'd to believe she has Charms enough to re∣claim me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether I ought to venture. 'Tis a great Risque, when Happiness lies at Stake. But come, Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> 'tis too late now to go back. Here's my Hand. If I have Reason to repent, I can blame none but myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare venture to assure you, you will have none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must we be idle, Madam? <STAGE>[To Laet.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there so much haste?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I'll wait your Leisure.</P>
<STAGE>[Affecting Gravity</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laet.</SPEAKER>
<P>D'you hear the Creature! Well, I'l punish you, I'm resolv'd, and consent at once Here, Sir, my Hand. Nay, take it, while I an in the Humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>And not your Heart!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="84"/>
<SPEAKER>Laet.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Hand is easily recall'd, but a Heart once gone, is gone for ever.—But come, Sir, you seem to look as if you thought they both go together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Liv.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they don't, <HI>Ned,</HI> 'tis no great Mat∣ter. If one comes first, t'other will soon follow. Poor Rogues, they can't keep their Hearts long from us, when they've once made us Masters of the Key to them. Ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Betty.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm impatient till I know what's done. I'll venture in.—Madam, did your Ladiship call?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has your Ladiship any more Commands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Child, but I have. With your Leave, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must command now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a Man that has serv'd me long and faithfully. The Way of Life I am now going into, renders his Service useless to me. I long in∣tended him a Farm of forty Pounds a Year. But as he will want a neat and clean Housekeeper, to share the Management of it, I have fix'd my Eyes on Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> your Woman, who seems to be cut out for an excellent Housewife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are all my Hopes come to this!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, <HI>Tom.</HI></P>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Tom.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Sirrah, what say you to a Farm of 40<HI>l.</HI> a Year, and a pretty Wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a Child already got, I suppose.—Sir, for the Farm I return you my most grateful Acknowledgements, for that cannot but turn out a real Good and Advantage to me. How this other Freehold may prove, I can't tell.—But 'tis no
<PB N="70" REF="85"/>
Matter.—I'll venture to take a Lease for Life. But hark'ee, my Dear, no Husbandman but my∣self, d'you hear, no Labourer to help me to do my Work. I'll warrant thee, Girl, I'll keep thee in good Order myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Tom,</HI> if thou art but as good as thy Word, I promise thee thou shalt reap the Fruits of No-body's Labour but thy own. But take heed. If like a lazy Lubbard you grow idle, and lee good Land run into Common, for want of enrich∣ing the Soil as it ought, it will fall to the Lord of the Manor again, and then, you know, he has a Right to turn his own Cattle a grazing there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Madam, we are now engag'd in a Voyage for Life. 'Tis for both our Interests to make it agreeable and happy. I shall do my Endeavour to give you no Uneasiness. Let's for∣get the past, and look forward.</P>
<L>When Passion governs with despotick Sway,</L>
<L>And its enchanting Dictates we obey,</L>
<L>Our Spirits, lifted up, a while we sail,</L>
<L>And plough Love's Ocean with a prosperous Gale:</L>
<L>Till, like a Tempest, Vice, at last, appears,</L>
<L>And full on Rocks and dangerous Quicksands bears.</L>
<L>If then some Pilot, with unerring Hand,</L>
<L>Oe'r the lost Barque deigns but to take Command,</L>
<L>The Rocks we dreaded most, with Ease, be shuns;</L>
<L>And safe to Port the sinking Vessel runs.</L>
<STAGE>[Exeunt Omnes.</STAGE>
