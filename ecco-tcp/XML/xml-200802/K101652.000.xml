ODE TO Mr. WRIGHT of DERBY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">1783.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AWAY! ye sweet, but trivial Forms,</L>
<L>That from the placid pencil rise,</L>
<L>When playful art the landscape warms</L>
<L>With Italy's unclouded skies!</L>
<L>Stay, Vanity! nor yet demand</L>
<L>Thy portrait from the painter's hand!</L>
<L>Nor ask thou, Indolence, to aid thy dream,</L>
<L>The soft illusion of the mimic stream,</L>
<L>That twinkles to thy sight with Cynthia's trem∣bling beam!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<L>Be thine, my friend, a nobler task!</L>
<L>Beside thy vacant easel see</L>
<L>Guests, who, with claims superior, ask</L>
<L>New miracles of art from thee:</L>
<L>Valour, who mocks unequal strife,</L>
<L>And Clemency, whose smile is life!</L>
<L>"WRIGHT! let thy skill (this radiant pair ex∣claim)</L>
<L>"Give to our view our favorite scene of Fame,</L>
<L>"Where Britain's Genius blaz'd in Glory's brightest flame."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Celestial ministers! ye speak</L>
<L>To no dull agent sloth-opprest,</L>
<L>Who coldly hears, in spirit weak,</L>
<L>Heroic Virtue's high behest:</L>
<L>Behold! tho' Envy strives to foil</L>
<L>The Artist bent on public toil,</L>
<L>Behold! his flames terrific lustre shed;</L>
<L>His naval blaze mounts from its billowy bed;</L>
<L>And Calpe proudly rears her war-illumin'd head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In gorgeous pomp for ever shine,</L>
<L>Bright monument of Britain's force!</L>
<L>Tho' doom'd to feel her fame decline</L>
<L>In ill-starr'd war's o'erwhelming course,</L>
<L>Tho' Europe's envious realms unite</L>
<L>To crush her, in unequal fight,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8"/>
Her Genius, deeply stung with generous shame,</L>
<L>On this exulting rock, array'd in flame,</L>
<L>Equals her ancient feats, and vindicates her name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How fiercely British valour pours</L>
<L>The deluge of destroying fire,</L>
<L>Which o'er that watery Babel roars,</L>
<L>Bidding the baffled host retire,</L>
<L>And leave their fall'n, to yield their breath</L>
<L>In different pangs of double death!</L>
<L>Ye shall not perish: no! ye hapless brave,</L>
<L>Reckless of peril, thro' the fiery wave</L>
<L>See! British mercy steers, each prostrate foe to save.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye gallant Chiefs, whose deeds proclaim</L>
<L>The genuine hero's feeling soul,</L>
<L>Elliot, and Curtis, with whose name</L>
<L>Honor enrich'd his radiant roll,</L>
<L>Blest is your fate; nor blest alone,</L>
<L>That rescued foes your virtues own,</L>
<L>That Britain triumphs in your filial worth:</L>
<L>Blest in the period of your glory's birth,</L>
<L>When art can bid it live to decorate the earth!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! what deeds, where virtue reign'd,</L>
<L>Have in oblivious darkness died,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
When Painting, by the Goths enchain'd,</L>
<L>No life-securing tints supplied!—</L>
<L>Of all thy powers, enchanting art!</L>
<L>Thou deemest this the dearest part,</L>
<L>To guard the rights of valour, and afford</L>
<L>Surviving lustre to the hero's sword:</L>
<L>For this, heroic Greece thy martial charms ador'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rival of Greece, in arms, in arts,</L>
<L>Tho' deem'd in her declining days,</L>
<L>Britain yet boasts unnumber'd hearts,</L>
<L>Who keenly pant for public praise:</L>
<L>Her battles yet are firmly fought</L>
<L>By Chiefs with Spartan courage fraught:</L>
<L>Her Painters with Athenian zeal unite</L>
<L>To trace the glories of the prosp'rous fight,</L>
<L>And gild th' embattled scene with art's immor∣tal light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' many a hand may well portray</L>
<L>The rushing war's infuriate shock,</L>
<L>Proud Calpe bids thee, WRIGHT! display</L>
<L>The terrors of her blazing rock:</L>
<L>The burning hulks of baffled Spain,</L>
<L>From thee she claims, nor claims in vain,</L>
<L>Thou mighty master of the mimic flame,</L>
<L>Whose matchless pencil, with peculiar aim,</L>
<L>Has form'd of lasting fire the basis of thy fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<L>Just in thy praise, thy country's voice</L>
<L>Loudly asserts thy signal power.</L>
<L>In this reward may'st thou rejoice,</L>
<L>In modest labour's silent hour,</L>
<L>Far from those seats, where envious leagues</L>
<L>And dark cabals, and base intrigues</L>
<L>Exclude meek Merit from his proper home;</L>
<L>Where Art, whom Royalty forbade to roam,</L>
<L>Against thy talents clos'd her self-dishonor'd dome.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When partial pride, and mean neglect,</L>
<L>The nerves of injur'd Genius gall,</L>
<L>What kindly spells of keen effect</L>
<L>His energy of heart recall?</L>
<L>Perchance there is no spell so strong</L>
<L>As Friendship's sympathetic song:</L>
<L>By fancy link'd in a fraternal band,</L>
<L>Artist and Bard in sweet alliance stand;</L>
<L>They suffer equal wounds, and mutual aid de∣mand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Go, then, to slighted worth devote</L>
<L>Thy willing verse, my fearless Muse!</L>
<L>Haply thy free and friendly note</L>
<L>Some joyous ardor may infuse</L>
<L>In fibres, that severely smart</L>
<L>From potent Envy's poison'd dart:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
Thro' WRIGHT'S warm breast bid tides of vi∣gor roll,</L>
<L>Guard him from meek Depression's chill con∣troul,</L>
<L>And rouse him to exert each sinew of his soul!</L>

<L>NO more let English pride arraign</L>
<L>The Gallic Muse, as light and vain,</L>
<L>Whose trifling fingers can but weave</L>
<L>The flimsy novel, to deceive</L>
<L>Inaction's languid hour;</L>
<L>Where sentiment, from nothing spun,</L>
<L>Shines like a garden-cobweb in the sun,</L>

<L>Too often, in the giddy fit</L>
<L>Of wanton or satiric wit,</L>
<L>The rash and frolic sons of France</L>
<L>Have sketch'd the frivolous romance;</L>
<L>While Reason stood aloof:</L>

<L>When I heard this fine speech, my fond passion was rais'd,</L>
<L>And I set forth in quest of the Being so prais'd;</L>
<L>At the mansion of Grandeur my search I begin,</L>
<L>And ask if the Goddess Content is within:</L>
<L>But Pride, who as centinel guarded the door,</L>
<L>Said bluntly he ne'er heard her title before;</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="54"/>
He told me I wanted a poor rustic slut,</L>
<L>And bade me go look in some little thatch'd hut.</L>
<L>I march'd to the Villager's lowly abode,</L>
<L>'Twas a snug pretty cottage, and stood near the road:</L>
<L>And here a good woman, possessing, tho' humble,</L>
<L>A face that could frown, and a tongue that would grumble,</L>
<L>Said—the person I ask'd for had lodg'd in her cot,</L>
<L>But, alas! such good luck was no longer her lot;</L>
<L>For she quitted her roof, where she oft had repos'd,</L>
<L>When you great house was built, and the common inclos'd.</L>

<L>Were squabbling about an electric conductor.</L>
<L>Some cry'd up the point; some commended the ball;</L>
<L>The soft breath of Science was turn'd to a squall:</L>
<L>The Sages no mental conductor could find</L>
<L>To draw off the flame that now flash'd on their mind.</L>

<L>In haste I exclaim'd, to the Learned adieu!</L>
<L>For even Science offends, when she talks like a shrew.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="55" REF="55"/>
<L>Having wander'd so wide of the object I sought,</L>
<L>I was now led to think, and rejoic'd at the thought,</L>
<L>This Goddess (herself for her charms so renown'd)</L>
<L>With the daughters of Beauty must surely be found</L>
<L>With this hope I approach'd (unperceiv'd by them all)</L>
<L>Three lovely young girls just array'd for the ball;</L>
<L>In each, whose bright eyes on a mirror were bent,</L>
<L>I thought I discover'd a spark of Content;</L>

<L>In her exquisite figure such graces were shewn,</L>
<L>That viewing her charms they distrusted their own.</L>
<L>Thou gentlest of nymphs! while thy triumphs increase,</L>
<L>Unconscious of beauty, so fatal to peace!</L>
<L>Tho' the sparks of Content in one sex thou may'st smother,</L>
<L>Bright Ecstasy's flame thou wilt raise in the other.</L>
<L>If in bosom parental Content could reside,</L>
<L>The heart of thy parent this treasure must hide;</L>
<L>But, alas! 'tis a truth which all parents lament,</L>
<L>Their tender anxiety stifles Content.</L>

<L>O tell me, while vainly to find thee I pant,</L>
<L>Dear latent Divinity! where is thy haunt?</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="56"/>
"Away to Batheaston," Good-nature replies,</L>
<L>"Behold she there weaves the poetical prize."</L>
<L>With thy Myrtle, kind MILLER! O let me be crown'd,</L>
<L>Then my search is repaid, and the Goddess is found:</L>
<L>Nay, if to another your wreath you assign,</L>
<L>And give it to verse far superior to mine,</L>
<L>My search's dear object I still must attain,</L>
<L>And the proof of this wonder's exceedingly plain,</L>
<L>It rests on this maxim, by Horace invented,</L>
<L>The Bard who writes worst is the Bard most con∣tented.</L>
<L>My claim to this blessing thus made very clear,</L>
<L>If I've nothing to hope, I have nothing to fear;</L>
<L>For MILLER can please while the mind she amuses,</L>
<L>Both when she bestows, and e'en when she refuses;</L>
<L>In truth I suspect, from her singular aim,</L>
<L>The Goddess I seek is conceal'd by her name;</L>
<L>She herself is Content, and her house is the fane,</L>
<L>Where Spleen and Ill-nature no favours obtain:</L>
<L>Some mortals in vain for admission must pray,</L>
<L>But all who once enter go smiling away.</L>
