<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Piece was finish'd above Two Years ago, and put into my Hands, to make what Use of it I thought fit. And tho' it cost our Author but the Labour of a single Month, or less, yet, upon this Occasion, I can't but think the pub∣lishing it will oblige the World, since it is a Sequel to Mr. <HI>Philips </HI>'s Play of Duke <HI>Humfrey,</HI> and an Introduction to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Alteration of <HI>Richard</HI> the Third. Never Child had a more regardless Fa∣ther, than the Parent of this; and therefore rather than have it smother'd, I thought it a more Human Act to let it come upon the Parish. And, in my poor Opinion, I have seen a less promising Appearance than this Brat carries about him, rise in the State.</P>
<Q><L>But if, like <HI>Phaeton,</HI> in <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Carr,</L>
<L>Th' unequal Muse unhappily should Err,</L>
<L>At least you'll own from glorious Heights he fell,</L>
<L>And there's some Merit in attempting well.</L><BIBL>Prol. to XIMENA.</BIBL></Q>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>EVER had King less Joy in Rule than I,</L>
<L>Nor more Misfortune; Heaven was pleas'd to set</L>
<L>My Cradle on the Top of humane Glory,</L>
<L>Where I lay helpless, to all Storms ex∣pos'd;</L>
<L>My childish Hand, not able to support</L>
<L>My Father's Sword, dropt the victorious Point,</L>
<L>And let fall all the Laurels that adorn'd it;</L>
<L>And <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> ravag'd for the Spoil.</L>
<L>So lost I <HI>France;</HI> now am I threatned too</L>
<L>By wicked Rebels, with the Loss of <HI>England:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cade</HI> and <HI>Plantagenet</HI> joyn to undo me.</L>
<L>Never did Subject long to be a King,</L>
<L>As I do long, and wish to be a Subject.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter the Queen, attended.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Queen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Health and good Tidings to your Majesty;</L>
<L>The Villain <HI>Cade,</HI> is kill'd by brave young <HI>Clifford.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Kill'd!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Queen.</SPEAKER>
<L>He is kill'd, my Lord; and all his Powers do yield,</L>
<L>And wait your Highness Doom, of Life, or Death.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Their Fault was great, 'tis true; but their Submission</L>
<L>Now cancels that, and they shall meet my Mercy.</L>
<L>Therefore with pleasing Pardon to them all,</L>
<L>I do dismiss 'em to their several Homes.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Queen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Kings should have Mercy, but with it Justice too.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Just Heaven accept my Vows of Thanks and Praise,</L>
<L>For having sav'd the Lives of my poor People.</L>
<L>I swear I am more pleas'd to see this End,</L>
<L>Without the Shedding my poor Subjects Blood,</L>
<L>Than I should be to conquer the whole World</L>
<L>By Slaughter—but—Ha! old <HI>Clifford</HI> weeping.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Old <HI>Clifford.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, Sir, I weep; but I weep Tears of Joy;</L>
<L>For I am crush'd between Two mighty Joys,</L>
<L>Your Royal Safety, and my Son's Success.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Young <HI>Clifford,</HI> and kneels.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>O gallant <HI>Clifford!</HI> how shall I reward thee?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>I fought not for Rewards; or if I did,</L>
<L>I ought to end my Work e'er I be paid.</L>
<L>I have only now pull'd down a paltry Scaffold,</L>
<L>On which <HI>Plantagenet</HI> design'd to climb,</L>
<L>To build his trayt'rous Projects—Have you not heard</L>
<L>The Duke of <HI>York</HI> is newly come from <HI>Ireland;</HI></L>
<L>And with a puissant and mighty Power,</L>
<L>Is marching hitherwards in proud Array.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>True, he approaches with a mighty Host,</L>
<L>But he gives out, he only does intend</L>
<L>To drive away from me some wicked Ministers.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>The constant Vizard of Rebellion.</L>
<L>Rebellion is so foul and grim a Monster,</L>
<L>That those who mount the horrid Beast are forc'd</L>
<L>To cover it all o'er with gawdy Trappings.</L>
<L>They mark it in the Forehead with white Stars,</L>
<L>Pretences heavenly.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Queen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Believe me, Sir—he tells you nought but Truth.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thus stands my State, 'twixt <HI>Cade</HI> and <HI>York</HI> distrest,</L>
<L>Like to a Ship, that having scap'd a Tempest</L>
<L>Is straitway calm'd, and boarded with a Pirate.</L>
<L>I pray thee, old <HI>Clifford,</HI> go and meet him,</L>
<L>And ask him what's the Reason of these Arms.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>O. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will, my Lord, and doubt not so to deal,</L>
<L>As all Things shall redound unto your Good.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Come Wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;</L>
<L>For yet may <HI>England</HI> curse my wretched Reign.</L>
<STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>York, Edward, George, Richard,</HI> and Soldiers.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>York.</SPEAKER>
<L>From <HI>Ireland</HI> thus comes <HI>York</HI> to claim his Right,</L>
<L>And pluck the Crown from feeble <HI>Henry</HI>'s Head.</L>
<L>Oh holy Majesty! who would not buy thee dear,</L>
<L>Let them obey that know not how to rule.</L>
<L>This Hand was made to handle nought but Gold.</L>
<L>I cannot give due Action to my Words,</L>
<L>Except a Sword or Sceptre ballance it.</L>
<L>A Scepter shall it have. Have I a Soul!</L>
<L>On which I'll toss the Flower de Luce of <HI>France.</HI></L>
<STAGE>Enter Old <HI>Clifford.</HI></STAGE>
<L>Whom have we here? old <HI>Clifford</HI> to disturb me?</L>
<L>The King hath sent him sure—I must dissemble.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>York,</HI> if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>York.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Clifford</HI> of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> I accept thy Greeting.</L>
<L>Art thou a Messenger, or come of Pleasure?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>A Messenger from <HI>Henry</HI> our dread Liege,</L>
<L>To know the Reason of these Arms in Peace?</L>
<L>Or why, thou being a Subject, as I am,</L>
<L>Against thy Oath, and true Allegiance sworn,</L>
<L>Should raise so great a Pow'r without his Leave;</L>
<L>Or dare to bring thy Force so near the Court?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>York.</SPEAKER>
<L>Scarce can I speak, my Choler is so great.</L>
<L>Oh! I could hew up Rocks, and fight with Flint,</L>
<L>I am so angry at these abject Terms:</L>
<L>And now, like frantick <HI>Ajax,</HI></L>
<L>On Sheep, or Oxen, could I spend my Fury.</L>
<L>I am far better born than is the King;</L>
<L>More like a King, more kingly in my Thoughts.</L>
<L>But I must make fair Weather yet a while,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Henry</HI> be more weak, and I more strong. <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE></L>
<L>O <HI>Cumberland,</HI> I prithee pardon me,</L>
<L>That I have giv'n no Answer all this while.</L>
<L>My Mind was troubled with deep Melancholy,</L>
<L>The Cause why I have brought this Army hither,</L>
<L>Is to remove proud <HI>Somerset</HI> from the King,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Seditious to his Grace, and to the State.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>That is too much Presumption on thy Part.</L>
<L>But if thy Arms be to no other End,</L>
<L>The King hath yielded unto thy Demand:</L>
<L>The Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI> is in the Tower.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>York.</SPEAKER>
<L>Upon thy Honour, Is he Prisoner?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>Upon my Honour, he is Prisoner.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>York.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then, noble <HI>Clifford,</HI> I'll dismiss my Pow'rs,</L>
<L>And let my Sovereign, virtuous <HI>Henry,</HI></L>
<L>Command my eldest Son; nay, all my Sons,</L>
<L>As Pledges of my Fealty and Love;</L>
<L>I'll send 'em all, as willing as I live.</L>
<L>Lands, Goods, House, Armour, every Thing I have,</L>
<L>Is to his Use, so <HI>Somerset</HI> may die.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>York,</HI> I commend this kind Submission;</L>

<L><HI>Clifford,</HI> doth <HI>York</HI> intend no Harm to us,</L>
<L>That thus he marches with thee Arm in Arm.</L>

<SPEAKER>York.</SPEAKER>
<L>In all Submission and Humility,</L>
<L><HI>York</HI> doth present himself unto your Highness.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then what intend these Forces thou dost bring.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>York.</SPEAKER>
<L>To have the Traytor <HI>Somerset</HI> from hence,</L>
<L>And fight against that monstrous Rebel <HI>Cade;</HI></L>
<L>Who since, I hear, is overcome and slain.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter the Queen, and <HI>Somerset.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>See, old <HI>Clifford; Somerset</HI> comes with the Queen;</L>
<L>Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Queen.</SPEAKER>
<L>For thousand <HI>Yorks</HI> he shall not hide his Head,</L>
<L>But boldly stand, and front him to his Face.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>York.</SPEAKER>
<L>How now? Is <HI>Somerset</HI> at Liberty?</L>
<L>Then <HI>York</HI> unloose thy long imprison'd Thoughts,</L>
<L>And let thy Tongue be equal with thy Heart.</L>
<L>Shall I endure the Sight of <HI>Somerset?</HI></L>
<L>False King, why hast thou broken Faith with me,</L>
<L>Knowing how hardly I can brook Abuse?</L>
<L>King, did I call thee? no, thou art no King,</L>
<L>Nor fit to govern and rule Multitudes,</L>
<L>Who has not Power to rule a single Traytor:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8"/>
That Head of thine doth not become a Crown;</L>
<L>Thy Hand is made to grasp a Palmer's Staff,</L>
<L>And not to grace an awful princely Scepter:</L>
<L>That Gold must round engirt these Brows of mine,</L>
<L>Whose Smile and Frown, like to <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Spear,</L>
<L>Is able, with the Change, to kill and cure;</L>
<L>Here is a Hand to hold the Scepter up,</L>
<L>And, with the same, to act controuling Laws:</L>
<L>Give Place; by Heav'n thou shalt rule no more</L>
<L>O'er him, whom Heav'n created for thy Ruler.</L>

<L>It is great Sin to swear unto a Sin,</L>

<L>Who can be bound by any solemn Vow,</L>
<L>To do a murderous Deed, to rob a Man,</L>

<L><HI>Henry,</HI> your Grandfather, murder'd his King,</L>

<L>Your Father, warlike <HI>Henry,</HI> I confess,</L>

<SPEAKER>War.</SPEAKER>
<L>Some Time ago I drown'd this News in Tears,</L>
<L>After the bloody Fray at <HI>Wakefield</HI> fought,</L>
<L>Where your brave Father breath'd his latest Gasp;</L>
<L>Tidings, as swiftly as the Post could run,</L>
<L>Were brought me of your Loss, and his Depart.</L>
<L>I then in <HI>London,</HI> Keeper of the King,</L>
<L>Muster'd my Soldiers, gather'd Flocks of Friends,</L>
<L>March'd towards St. <HI>Albans</HI> to intercept the Queen.</L>
<L>Bearing the King, in my Behalf, along;</L>
<L>For by my Scouts I was advertis'd,</L>
<L>That she was coming with a full Intent</L>
<L>To dash our late Decrees in Parliament,</L>
<L>Touching King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Oaths, and your Succession.</L>
<L>Short Tale to make, we at St. <HI>Albans</HI> met,</L>
<L>Our Battles join'd, and for long Time we fought;</L>
<L>But whether 'twas the Coldness of the King,</L>
<L>Who look'd full gently on his warlike Queen,</L>
<L>That robb'd my Soldiers of their heated Spleen;</L>
<L>Or, whether 'twas Report of her Success,</L>
<L>Or more than common Fear of <HI>Clifford</HI>'s Vigor,</L>
<L>Who thunders to his Captives Blood and Death,</L>
<L>I cannot judge, but to conclude with Truth,</L>
<L>Their Weapons like to Light'ning came and went;</L>
<L>Our Soldiers, like the Night-Owls lazy Flight,</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="30"/>
Or like a lazy Thrasher with his Flail,</L>
<L>Fell gently down, as if they struck their Friends;</L>
<L>I cheer'd 'em up with Justice of our Cause,</L>
<L>With Promise of high Pay, and great Reward,</L>
<L>But all in vain, they had no Heart to fight;</L>
<L>And we in them no Hope to win the Day,</L>
<L>So that we fled; the King unto the Queen,</L>
<L>Lord <HI>George,</HI> your Brother; <HI>Norfolk</HI> and my self,</L>

<L>Once more we fit on <HI>England's</HI> Royal Throne,</L>

<L>Three Dukes of <HI>Somerset,</HI> threefold renown'd</L>
<L>For hardy and undoubted Champions.</L>
<L>Two <HI>Cliffords,</HI> as the Father and the Son.</L>
<L>And two <HI>Northumberlands;</HI> two braver Men,</L>
<L>Ne'er spur'd their Coursers at the Trumpet's Sound.</L>
<L>With them the two brave Bears, <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Mountague,</HI></L>
<L>That in their Chains fetter'd the kingly Lion,</L>
<L>And made the Forest tremble when they roar'd.</L>

<SPEAKER>Edw.</SPEAKER>
<L>Away with her, and waft her hence to <HI>France.</HI></L>
<L>And then what rests, but that we spend the Time</L>
<L>With stately Triumphs, mirthful Comick Shews,</L>
<L>Such as befit the Pleasure of the Court,</L>
<L>So to divert our Subjects busy Minds,</L>
<L>From doing farther Mischief 'gainst the State.</L>
<LG>
<L><HI>Sound Drums and Trumpets, farewel all Annoy,</HI></L>
