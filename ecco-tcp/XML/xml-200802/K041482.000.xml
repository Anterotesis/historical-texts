<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SIGISMOND, the son of the Emperor Charles IV. was elected King of Hungary 1386, and Emperor of Germany 1410. His first wife, Mary, being dead, he espoused, about the year 1414, Barbara, the daughter of Hernan, Count of Cilley. Sigismond made the Counts of Cilley independent Princes of the Empire; and called them to the Diets, without the consent of the House of Austria, their supreme Lords, who, unwilling to emancipate the County from its dependâˆ£ance upon them, declared war against the Count in possession. By Barbara, Sigismond had only one child, a daughter, named Elizabeth. Sigismond died 1437.</P>
<P>Albert V. Duke of Austria, who had married Elizabeth, Sigismond's daughter, succeeded him in the Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary. Albert died 1440, leaving two daughters; his Queen Elizabeth was big with child at the time of his death; the child proved a son, and was named Ladislaus.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Albert II. as Emperor, and V. as Duke of Austria, his cousin, Frederick, great grandson of Albert II. Duke of Austria, was immeâˆ£diately elected Emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="17"/>The Hungarians, almost constantly engaged in war against the Turks, either for the defence of their own country, or of the neighbouring states, deemed an infant Prince and a Queen Regent unequal to the safe government of a kingdom which, by frequent wars, was kept in continual alarm. The crown of Hungary, by the constitution of the kingdom, being elective, (though sometimes possessed in hereditary succession) Uladislaus, the young King of Poland, was chosen King, by the advice of John Corvin Huniades, Earl of Bistrie, whom Uladislaus made Vaywode of Transylvania. Huniades was as celeâˆ£brated for his virtues as for his valour. He was pious towards God, faithful to his country and his prince, and kind and benevolent to his friends; as a warrior he was politic, of invincible courage, and mostly forâˆ£tunate: he was the first Christian commander who showed that the Turks might be overcome; and he obtained more victories against them than any one of the Christian Princes before him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir William Temple says that, "Huniades was one of the three Worthies who deserved a Crown without wearing one." The reward, merited by the virtues and great talents of the father, was paid to the son; for in 1458, the Hungarians, from their love to Huniades, and grateâˆ£ful remembrance of his long services, chose his son, Matthias Corvinus, for their King.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Elizabeth, unable to prevent this choice, put her son, Uladislaus, under the protection of the Emperor Frederick III. Thus, of Albert's possessions, only Austria, and the kingdom of Bohemia, remained unâˆ£alienated from his posthumous son, Ladislaus.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="18"/>In the battle of Varna, 1444, fought between the Turks, commanded by their King, Amurath II. and the Hungarians, led by Huniades, Uladislaus the King of Hungary was slain; Huniades, by whose side he fought, having left him to go and rally the left wing of the Christian army.</P>
<P>The Hungarians now elected Albert's son Ladiâˆ£slaus King; and they chose Huniades, their General, Governor of Hungary during his minority. The Emâˆ£peror Frederick detaining the infant King in Gerâˆ£many, Huniades, as Governor of Hungary, declared war against him. After a long contest, which the Hungarians were obliged to intermit, on account of their wars against the Turks, the Emperor, not strong enough to defend his dominions from being ravaged by the incursions of the Hungarians, at last in 1452 delivered up their king; then eleven years of age. An assembly was appointed at Vienna, to which the nobles of Hungary and Bohemia were invited. At this assembly it was decreed that, during the minority of Ladislaus, Huniades should govern Hungary; that George Podiebrad should govern Bohemia; and that Ulrick, Count of Cilley, great uncle to the King, should govern Austria, and be guardian of his person.</P>
<P>Count Cilley, envious of the glory of Huniades, excited some parties of Bohemians and Moravians to attack Upper Austria: but they proved unsuccessful when opposed by Huniades. Ambitious of the govâˆ£ernment of Hungary, Count Cilley accused Huâˆ£niades, the Governor, to the King; but he justified
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
himself from the accusation. Count Cilley's ambition increasing with the power which he derived from being the King's guardian; he attempted to make himself absolute master of Austria. To effect which, he secured the principal fortresses, by giving them to the command of unprincipled people whom he had attached to his interest; gradually removing Elsinger, and the Austrian nobility, from all offices of importâˆ£ance. This conduct gave great umbrage to the people. Elsinger took advantage of their discontent; and, aided by Huniades, obliged Ulrick to retire to his own territory of Cilley. Thus, by the bravery and conduct of these two warriors, Austria was wrested from Count Cilley's usurpation.</P>
<P>Mahomet II. the seventh King, and the first Emâˆ£peror of the Turks, who took Constantinople May 29, 1453, which his great grandfather, Bajazet I. and his father Amurath II. had unsuccessfully besieged, marched 1456<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Universal History, vol. XXVI. p. 296, there is a mistake in the date of this Siege of Belgrade, which is there put down A.D. 1459; and in vol. XXXII. p. 149, the date is 1456, which last agrees with other Historians.</NOTE> with an army of 150,000 men to besiege Belgrade, then thought the key to Hungary.</P>
<P>As soon as the report of Mahomet's intention to besiege Belgrade, reached the young King Ladislaus, then fifteen years of age, he fled to the court of the Emperor Frederick; which much displeased his Hunâˆ£garian subjects, as it had before cost them a long and tedious contest to get him out of the Emperor's power.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="20"/>Besides his numerous army, of 150,000 men, Mahomet provided a fleet, of 200 ships and gallies, which he sent up the Danube from Viden to Belâˆ£grade; to the intent that no relief, or aid, should be brought into the city out of Hungary by the great rivers of the Danube and the Save; upon the conâˆ£fluence of which, the city of Belgrade stands. Not contented with thus closely blockading the city on all sides, Mahomet sent part of his fleet further up the Danube, and landing troops spoiled the country in many places on the banks of the river. On his first coming before Belgrade, he made a fierce asâˆ£sault, but was repulsed: he found the Hungarians ready to receive him, and prepared to skirmish with his troops, without the walls, as well as to defend the city. Mahomet, finding his arms so resolutely opposed, began to proceed more warily; and inâˆ£trenched his army. He provided for its safety, against the sudden sallies of the besieged, by casting up deep trenches and strong rampires. After plantâˆ£ing his battery, he began to shake the wall of the city most furiously with his great artillery: insomuch that he battered down a part of it level with the ground. But the defendants with great labour and industry speedily repaired it, by casting up new forâˆ£tifications and rampires, so that it was stronger than before.</P>
<P>Campestran, a Franciscan monk, having at this time preached, in Germany, a crusade against the Turks, had collected an army of 40,000 men. With
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
these, his followers, he entered Belgrade to assist in its defence against Mahomet, who was become the terror of all Christendom by his conquests, his enterâˆ£prising genius, his capacious mind improved by all the learning of the age, his indefatigable industry in the pursuit of whatever he undertook, his irresistible courage, his insatiable cruelty, his avowed impiety, his blood-thirstiness, his immeasurable ambition, his impious treachery, and his unrelenting flinty-hearted severity; so that against his ambition there was no mound, on his faith or friendship no dependance, and in his least displeasure death.</P>
<P>Huniades, who was gone to Upper Hungary, to raise supplies, was expected to sail from Buda, with a fleet of ships and gallies stored with warlike proâˆ£visions; when Mahomet, having been a month beâˆ£fore Belgrade, prepared to give a general assault, although his superstitious troops were much dispirited from the appearance of two comets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ohsson's Hist. Gen. of the Othoman Empire, vol. 1. p. 539.</NOTE>; and the death of Carazius the Lieutenant-General, who was killed by a canon-shot from the city; which circumstances they considered as prognosticks of ill success. At this time, A. D. 1456, August 5, the fleet of Huniades came in sight, and was met by Mahomet's fleet four miles up the Danube beyond Belgrade.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE FIRSTâ€”THE TENT OF MAHOMET.</HEAD>
<STAGE>A magnificent Tent, occupying the greatest part of the stage, in width; its form circular. The outer tent forming a hall of audience. Two doors, at the back of the tent, conducting to the interior part of it. In the middle, between the two doors, a splendid Throne, with a canopy over it; the drapery of the canopy hanging from a large crescent, representing gems. At each side of the tent, near the front, a rich sofa. The side scenes about the tent trees. The scene behind the tent the Turkish Camp; a crescent on the top of each tent.</STAGE>
<STAGE>The scene drawing discovers Mustapha, seated on one of the sofas. An Aga enters the tent, holding his right hand motionless on his breast, according to the Turkish manner of salutation.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MUSTAPHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>You will not gain it yet; for disappointment,</L>
<L>Rage, and revenge, possess the Sultan's soul</L>
<L>By turns. His pride is wounded at the thought</L>
<L>Of that disgrace, his fame will now sustain,</L>
<L>Unless Belgrade should fall, by storm, or stratagem.</L>

<SPEAKER>CHUSANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>My orders from his Highness are imperfect:</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MUSTAPHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>If she be gain'd, these Christian Dogs will rest</L>
<L>Secure of peace: and, when they find our Fleet</L>
<L>Was burnt, but to molest Huniades,</L>
<L>They will impute this marriage to our fears.</L>
<L>They will exult: but when in midnight wine,</L>
<L>Supine they're drown'd, and unprepar'd to meet us,</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="90"/>Then shall we thunder, at their half-arm'd walls,</L>
<L>With all our mighty war: at once assault,</L>
<L>And level, their high towers, ere they have time</L>
<L>To weep their falling.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHUSANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Should they this intent</L>
<L>Suspect, and much I fear they will, we're caught</L>
<L>In our own toils. This policy may fail,</L>
<L>They may refuse the Princess to our Sultan.</L>
<L>Then great advantage does this parley give them.</L>
<L>Ere we can storm, Huniades may land;</L>

<L>Another destiny, now frowning, threats us.</L>

<L>What shall we gain? The Christian Dervis aids them:</L>
<L>Corvinus too, that Son of fierce Huniades,</L>

<L>HAIL to my darling Child! This smiling morn</L>
<L>Rises auspicious to behold my joy;</L>
<L>This is the birth-day of thy regal power:</L>
<L>And my child mounts this Day her Father's Throne.</L>
<L>Revolted Arragon now courts thy sway,</L>

<L>Oh! may that Crown, which Heaven, this Day, restores me,</L>

<L>Though Queen, I still her subject shall remain.</L>
<L>Her prudent counsels, and her wise resolves,</L>
<L>Will sway and safely guide my youthful mind.</L>
<L>This is indeed a Day of high import;</L>
<L>Alike distinguish'd by eventful fate,</L>
<L>To fix for Arragon, and rich Castile,</L>
<L>A future Monarch on their envy'd Thrones.</L>
<L>This Day the beauteous Isabella names</L>

<L>O my Elvira! wouldst thou fix thy choice,</L>

<L>From anxious care my mind would be reliev'd.</L>
<L>Troubles, from long misrule, will rise in Arragon;</L>
<L>And I am all thy counsel, or defence:</L>
<L>And can I on that Throne protect my Child,</L>
<L>Which all her Father's valour fail'd to guard?</L>
<L>A valiant Husband's arm would prop thy state;</L>
<L>Disperse the mutinous, and quell rebellion.</L>
<L>Let prudence plead the cause of love, Elvira!</L>
<L>Reward the godlike passion of Alvarez,</L>
<L>Who sought thy hand, whilst hopeless of a Crown.</L>
<L>Now emulate the worth thy soul esteems;</L>

<SPEAKER>D. ELVIRA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Heaven well rewards his virtuous deeds to me.</L>
<L>A Throne, more splendid far than mine, now courts him,</L>
<L>With Isabella, in Castile to reign.</L>
<L>The brave Castilians name him of the <HI>Three</HI></L>
<L>From whom they wish their Queen to chuse a Conâˆ£sort.</L>
<L>First, my dear Mother! let me mount my throne,</L>
<L>Before I fix with whom, that Throne to share.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. LEONORA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! my foreboding fears! Your choice is made.</L>
<L>Reflect, my Child! whilst yet the power remains,</L>
<L>What grief, what dangers may await your love.</L>
<L>Resist this fatal impulse of your heart,</L>
<L>Which will embitter all your future life.</L>
<L>Could my maternal bosom yield consent,</L>
<L>Yet would the Nobles of your Realm submit</L>
<L>To bow the knee to one, plebeian born?</L>
<L>Too much, alas! the valiant Carlos charms you.</L>
<L>But what avails his matchless worth? His blood</L>
<L>Springs from some base, contaminated source,</L>
<L>Which he, through pride, with conscious shame, conâˆ£ceals.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. ELVIRA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet, though conceal'd, its source may be most pure.</L>
<L>For have not princes, men of high renown,</L>
<L>Disguis'd themselves, their names, and birth deny'd,</L>
<L>Whose swords alone have signaliz'd their fame;</L>
<L>Subduing kingdoms, and bestowing crowns:</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="163"/>Singly the fate of empires, and of kings.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. LEONORA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is this the flattering hope your heart has cherish'd?</L>
<L>And the distinction which you pay to Carlos,</L>
<L>Is it then love, grafted on hope fallacious?</L>
<L>Ah! my dear Child! give not such room for censure,</L>
<L>Nor cherish sentiments, you must subdue.</L>
<L>Avoid the converse which destroys your peace,</L>
<L>And lends the venom'd tongue of slander, speech.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. ELVIRA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Such rare endowments, and such gallant worth,</L>
<L>As Carlos owns, in noble minds, excite</L>
<L>Esteem, complacent friendship, and urbanity.</L>
<L>I but that tribute of regard bestow,</L>
<L>Which his transcendent virtues justly claim;</L>
<L>Chaste as a sister's innocent affection.</L>
<L>Can this reflect upon my virgin fame,</L>
<L>Or draw the breath of calumny against me?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. LEONORA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Beauty and youth, with princely rank combin'd,</L>
<L>Winning admirers, draw observers too.</L>
<L>The storm, unheeded, deluges the weed,</L>
<L>Whilst, on the garden's pride, the peerless lily,</L>
<L>And the sweet, opening rose, not unobserv'd</L>
<L>Hang, e'en the freshning dew-drops of the morn.</L>
<L>Carlos commands respect from ev'ry heart;</L>
<L>And, did his merits less conspicuous shine,</L>
<L>Your gentle soul uncensur'd might esteem him.</L>
<L>But to each virtue, that adorns the man,</L>
<L>A warrior's valour, and a hero's fame,</L>
<L><PB N="151" REF="164"/>He adds each striking, each attractive grace;</L>
<L>Commanding, awful, yet inspiring love;</L>
<L>In port a monarch, and in mind a god.</L>
<L>When he appears, each eye with pride surveys him;</L>
<L>All seem to take a fashion from his mien,</L>
<L>And with complacent hope, admire their model.</L>
<L>Though ev'ry lady courts him by her smiles,</L>
<L>Whom has he yet distinguish'd but yourself?</L>
<L>Save when he pays his duty to his Queen.</L>
<L>In his attention you such pleasure take,</L>
<L>That you betrayâ€”more than esteem for Carlos.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. ELVIRA.</SPEAKER>
<L>That homage which queens claims, does Carlos offer;</L>
<L>He pays his court like others, who approach me;</L>
<L>Worth, such as his, knows no temerity.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. LEONORA.</SPEAKER>
<L>With you to Arragon does Carlos go,</L>
<L>Only to pay his court, as here he pays it?</L>
<L>The worth he owns may make his thoughts aspire;</L>
<L>And he, who guards your Throne, may hope your love.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. ELVIRA.</SPEAKER>
<L>War is the element of souls like his;</L>
<L>From victory to victory they fly;</L>
<L>Glory their idol, and their wish distinction.</L>
<L>Seville dismantled, and the Moors defeated,</L>
<L>Castile, triumphant, wants his arm no more.</L>
<L>His great ambition, thus without an object</L>
<L>Offers his sword against our Rebel, Garcia.</L>
<L>His valour will achieve, what, with success.</L>
<L><PB N="152" REF="165"/>Our subjects have begun; chase this Usurper,</L>
<L>And bid fair peace, and safety, grace my Throne.</L>

<L>But, when his conqu'ring sword has fix'd your reign,</L>
<L>Your subjugated Vassals at your feet,</L>
<L>Will Carlos quit your Realm, to seek fresh toils;</L>
<L>Nor hope that Crown, his valour may have sav'd?â€”</L>

<P>Merciful stars! I did not think that he had been in such a wicked passion as that came to neither.â€”And all for my telling him an unwelâˆ£come truth. I fear and esteem my father; but he has never taught me to love him. He is justice herself, he holds the scales with a steady hand, and wields the sword with unrelenting rigour;â€”except when he is himself the culprit. But thanks to you, Madam! for interposing, so that he has broken the Oath; 't was rashly made; and not fit to be kept: but in his next passion, he will again swear, and as easily break the vow.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, for your own sake, that you will not make the experiment; for, however willing I may be to sue for your peace, I may lose my influâˆ£ence: for your Mother, Adelinda! could not, last night, obtain your pardon till she knelt for it at your father's feet.</P>

<P>O, my dear Mother! what do I not owe to your patience and your goodness?â€”But 't is all, all, in vain; for I was born to disgrace and grieve you. Yet do not hate,â€”do not curse me!â€”</P>

you, that you will change your conduct. That you will behave with more duty and attention to your Father; and that you will treat your Cousin more properly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adelinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that Cousin of mine is as plagueâˆ£ful as a Ghost in a haunted house; I am never at quiet for him: I am always engaged, either in a quarrel with himself; or with my father about him. I wish that the Chaplain would exorcise him for an evil spirit; and confine him to the bottom of the Red Sea for nine hundred and ninety-nine years. I am sure that I would never light the end of candle that should release him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am astonished that neither his birth, his rank, nor his accomplishments, procure him respect, or even common civility, from you, and yet you are much indebted to his generous disinâˆ£terestedness.â€”Your Father has offered, if you will not change your conduct, to settle his whole fortune upon him: but he most nobly rejected it, declaring that he would never enjoy what he considered as your birthright, unless you shared it with him. He laments, yet always lessens, your imperfections.â€”And he avers, that notwithstanding your foibles, that both in heart and mind you are capable of great things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adelinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>He sticks to his text I find; for he always begins his sermons by telling me what fine things I could do, if I would but give my soul elbow room. Yet I suspect he treats me with the oil of fool, alias flattery, only for the ostentation of displaying
<PB N="259" REF="269"/>
his own sagacity, whilst I question his seeing further into a millstone than other people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>Adelinda! be serious, and give me your attention.â€”If your father's intentions be not altered, by his last night's anger, you will you know be very shortly your Cousin's Wife; even within a few days. Therefore, my dear Child! this is the crisis of your fate; and I am trembling for your future happiness, with all the anxiety of a Mother, who sees the rock, upon which your heedless youth will drive, to its assured destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adelinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Madam, I cannot new make myself, either to shew my gratitude to you, or my obedience to my Lordly Father. He might as well quarrel with his pack of hounds, because they have not flowing manes like his coach-horses, as with me for not being a fine lady.â€”And when all is said and done, for my share, I do not perceive what there is so outrageously amiss in me, to make all this constant havock about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you have good qualities every body allowsâ€”But your bluntness, your rudeness of speech, your intractable temper, your churlish manâˆ£ners, your inflexible obstinate humour, disgrace the nobleness of your birth, and disgust every one who lives, or converses, with you. And, indeed, unless you correct your untoward disposition, you cannot expect to live on comfortable and pleasant terms with the Count, when the lover will be lost in the husband. And would you not wish to be considered as your
<PB N="260" REF="270"/>
husband's first friend, and favourite companion. Could you like to live neglected, despised, forgotten?</P>

<SPEAKER>Adelinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith! I do not say that neither.</P>

<P>There is so much wanting to be done, Madam! to make me what you with, that I shall never have the heart even to begin. I might toil up a high hill, but, alas! I am quite hopeless of walking up the outside of a church steeple;â€”indeed, Madam! my reformation is a moral impossibility; and you alâˆ£ways paint me so much of a Black-a-moor, that I am sure 't is labour in vain to attempt to wash me white.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear Child! it is not; if you would but once resolve to constrain your temâˆ£per:â€”make the effort at least.â€”Reflect seriously upon the consequence of your first steps in life; they will stamp your character with the world: and have you no wish to be admired?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adelinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no! there is more cost than worâˆ£ship in it;â€”to gain your sort of admiration, I must be constantly in the pilloryâ€”and for what?â€”why only the <HI>hopes</HI> of a mouthful of moon-shine.</P>

<P>But, Adelinda! even esteem is very reluctantly paid, if not refused, to those whose strange humour, and rude, offensive familiarity, disgust and affront every body. And, if you will persist in reâˆ£taining your churlishness, and inattention, how will you appear in polished society?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adelinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord! Madam! like a carp out of water. The society which delights you, is not my element: and I shall never be any thing in it, but a queer fish gaping and floundering about. For the fine folks, and fine manners, of your polished societies, are my hatred and utter aversion; their maxims would suffocate every natural feeling of my heart, and annihilate every useful property of my underâˆ£standing; for I must love and hate by a factitious rule and measure; and judge and give my voice, by weights which I know to be false; the fastidious drams and scruples, illegally stamped as standard, by the usurped authority of folly, falshood, affectation, and nonsense.</P>

But all these flattering dreams vanish. You

Charming fellow! how handsome he is! What a fine figure!

<P>Poor Flora!â€”Well, Strasbourg! what is the business?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Strasbourg.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord! the Widow of your late tenant, Orland, sends me word that she is coming this morning with her rent; and to beg that your Lordship
<PB N="278" REF="288"/>
will be pleased to renew the lease of the Olstain Farm to her. I suppose that you have no objection to reâˆ£newing the lease; but at what rent, my Lord? all your other tenants have had their rents raised; but Dorcas tells me, that she hopes as she nursed my Young Lady that you will favour her.â€”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marquis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: on that consideration; and as she is a Widow, I will renew the lease, for the term of her life, at the same rent.â€”I suppose the report of Adelinda's marriage brought her hither just at this time, that she might be present at the wedding. Has she brought her pretty Daughter with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I do not know, my Lord!â€”'tis not certainâ€”perhaps soâ€”I believe she hasâ€”I, I, rather think she mayâ€”but I cannot be positiveâ€”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marquis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to think, Strasbourg! that you are in love with that girl: you are always so emâˆ£barrassed, so shy, and look so very silly, whenever I question you about your visits to that part of the Country. Your confused, mysterious answers, have made me suspect that some love affair was your business at Olstain, and not the barn-building, or seeing after the workmen.â€”I want to see this girl, this Zella, I have heard so much of her beauty.â€”But are you seriously in love with her, Strasbourg?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Strasbourg.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord! Zella, to be sure, is a sweet pretty creature, a sweet pretty creature, indeed, my Lord! to be sure. So genteel, so delicate, so blooming, one must be a statue not to be struck with her. Every body is in love with her. But she rejects
<PB N="279" REF="289"/>
every body, and wants her mother to let her be a Nun; but it is pity that she should, as Dorcas can give her a good deal of money whenever she marries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Are your high notions then so far humâˆ£bled as to marry a farmer's daughter? What is beâˆ£come of your taste and your pride? But do you really intend to make her your Wife?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Strasbourg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, my Lord! I blush at demeanâˆ£ing myself so muchâ€”But, my Lord! let love plead my excuse; irresistible love, which, I have been unable to conquer, in spite of every the most powerâˆ£ful reasons for overcoming it.â€”I love so fervently, that I would rather die, than not win the Woman whom I adore.â€”

<P>You speak as one deeply smitten inâˆ£deed, Strasbourg! But one thing it behoves me to tell you: Zella, being the daughter of my tenant,
<PB N="280" REF="290"/>
and very young, as she has lost her Father, whom I very much respected, I think her intitled to my proâˆ£tection; therefore, know certainly your own mind about this girl, before you lay siege to her heart. Your pride may step in now, but I tell you, that it shall not afterwards. You have had several attachâˆ£ments, so I suspect your constancy in this; and I will allow of no foolery in this affair: you have my consent to court her for your wife; but not to dangle after her for your amusement, and then leave her to wear the willow.</P>

<P>Adelinda! if you saw my heart, though it beats with fear, yet it is not for myself, but for you. A moment of distraction, in spite of all my duty to my Master, and all my respect for you, made me discover my hopeless passion; you parâˆ£doned this act of presumption and despairâ€”you, like an angel, heard and pitied my sufferings,â€”fatally heard, and pitied them, till you shared them. O Adeâˆ£linda! do you not hate me, do you not despise the selfishness, that had not the courage to be wretched by itself? I see with deep repentance, for your sake, the dreadful abyss into which you are going to be plunged. Into what peril have I betrayed you!</P>

<STAGE>THE MARCHIONESS, FLORA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM astonished that Strasbourg, who thinks himself so adorable and a match for a Princess, should condescend to think of the Daughter of Dorcas for a Wife. My Lord's interfering and breaking off the match is to be sure a very extraordiâˆ£nary step; yet I cannot think it a sufficient reason for your suspicions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flora.</SPEAKER>
<P>My suspicions, as you well know, Madam! have been but too often right. And my Lord Marquis has had too many intrigues, for me, not to suspect him very much, of entering into a new one, when he prevents a pretty girl's marriage, and takes away her Mother's authority, by declaring himself her Guarâˆ£dian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has he done that too, as well as prevent the marriage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam! and Strasbourg is quite jealâˆ£ous about it.â€”I heard but little, for it was Lucy whom he charged with the embassy to you, but she begged me to tell it to you. I believe that she thinks as I do, for she seemed half frighted out of her wits: she says that Strasbourg has puzzled and confounded
<PB N="306" REF="316"/>
her, by telling her of his jealousy. I questioned her; but she said she dared not speak what she thought: and ran away from me. I knew not what to think of her flutterings; perhaps she is in love with him herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! do not tell me of such shaâˆ£dows of suspicions; I have enough for serious unâˆ£easiness, without anticipating vexations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flora.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam! Strasbourg says, that he will lay his life, that the Marquis has designs upon the Girl; and that he will find her a very easy conquest, unless you interpose. Yet he charged Lucy not to tell you, that my Lord was in love with her, for fear of making you uneasy; but he is sure that he is; and that the girl perceives it, and that as she is quite a village coquette, an artful little monkey, she will know how to secure her conquest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope that my Lord is more honâˆ£ourable than to seduce her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flora.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may hope it, Madam! but you will be disappointed. If I were you, I would order the little baggage into my presence, box her ears, and command her to be turned out of doors. She should not stay a minute under my roof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such conduct would ill become any woman. And though my Lord appears to be relapsâˆ£ing into his former errours, yet who knows, but what he may have some praiseworthy motive for his conâˆ£duct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus you always excuse him, Madam
<PB N="307" REF="317"/>
and I could bite my fingers for madness, to see how you appear to study to deceive yourself. When I am sure, Madam! that, in your heart, you must be as unhappy, as jealousy, that worst of demons, can make you. If I were you, I would make a fine bustle, and havoc, about it: all the world should know how vilely I was treated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be the sure way to make my Husband regard me as an enemy; and he would soon hate me, however unjustly, for having the temerity to proclaim his failings.</P>

captivates the heart, and, on conversing with her, astonishes the mind. The more you look at her, and listen to her, the more the strikes you; and you are attached to her by an irresistible impulse.

<P>Believe me, Madam! I do not exagâˆ£gerate; what I tell you is the simple truth: I have been conversing with her this hour in my study. Dorcas, through foolish vanity, has given her an exâˆ£cellent education, and, for her years, I am astonished at her knowledge. I most sincerely pity the suffering which the elegant mind of this gentle Girl must

<P>The poor Girl applied to me, to set aside her Mother's project, of marrying her to Strasâˆ£bourg.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems to me, my Lord! that Strasbourg's proposal does her much honour; even with all the beauty which you describe her to have, she could scarcely expect so advantageous an offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marquis.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she testified so strong an aversion for him, that, through pity for her, I absolutely forbad the marriage.</P>

In order to reserve Zella for himself. Keep a sharp look out, Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strasbourg has sent to me, through Lucy and Flora, to beg that I will speak to you in his behalf; therefore permit me to become his advoâˆ£cate. I shall esteem it as the highest favour done to me, if you will put him again upon good terms with Dorcas and her Daughter; and persuade the Girl to accept of so good an offer of marriage.</P>
</SP>

<P>That is impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchioness.</SPEAKER>
<P>How impossible, my Lordâ–ª Dorcasâ–ª
<PB N="310" REF="320"/>
it seems, had consented, very wisely, to the marriage. And why, my Lord! should you protect a rebellious, vain Girl in her opposition to her Mother's authority and judgment? You should rather enforce her obeâˆ£dience, than encourage her in her undutiful obstinacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marquis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zella, Madam! did not want to have her obedience to her Mother enforced upon her. The sweet Girl was ready to obey her unfeeling mandate, with all the respectful submission of a Daughter, and all the resignation of a martyr. I declare to you, Madam! that, but for her tears, I should have thought an angel stood before me, when, after pleading for pity in vain, she spoke the strong sense which she had of her duty to her Mother, and of her resolution to obey her, though at the price of all her future happiness. Then, and not till then, I interposed my authority in her favour. The thoughts of her being devoted to misery pierced my heart with grief; whilst the fortitude of her resignation almost awed me. I cannot consent that she shall be driven to despair; it would be a deep suffering to myself.</P>

<P>I have been upon the watch; and, as I saw nobody about; so I safely pursue my own busiâˆ£ness. Love, by my hands, presents you with these jewels.

<P>True, Strasbourg! and so it would, if I did not quit my inheritance, through regard for you.

<P>Forgive you, my sweet Adelinda! Oh, No! He is too much of a Lord for that; unless you

<P>For Heaven's sake, Strasbourg! do not take the bills. I have pride, and your honour is dear to me.

Therefore, be strictly honest, and reâˆ£store the bills.</P>

<P>See Lucy, my Lord! and judge from her account, which, though certain as to their corresponâˆ£dence, and their intended flight, is not such as I could make out fromâ€”whether they be actually married. When you be certified as to that, command your anger sufficiently to see Strasbourg.â€”Insist upon his quitting the Kingdom for ever, as the sole means of exemption he can hope, from forfeiting his life, in an ignominious manner, to the offended laws of his country.

Whence this fullen silence, this soul-piercing Scorn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zella.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the most poignant sensations; from Grief; from Shame; from Indignation; from hatred at your selfishness; from contempt at your meanness. How insidious are you, my Lord! thus pretending to admire my beauty, whilst you are seeking to destroy it; for by invading the innocent serenity of my bosom, you would cover my face with the pale hue of discontent, and drown my eyes with tears. How selfâˆ£ish and artful it is to plead your passion for me, which seeks only my destruction. How mean and contemptible to ask my love or implore my pity. Why should I love you? What pity, or what tenderâˆ£ness can my mind feel for you? You yourself, my Lord! now teach me what regard I ought to have for
<PB N="350" REF="360"/>
the repose of your heart, when you seek to plant endless torments in mine.</P>

<P>Oh, no! it makes you an object of detestaâˆ£tion, not of affection. Pardon, my Lord! the disâˆ£respectful language which you force from me. Let me beg of you to retain that respect, which I wish to pay to you, by neither prolonging now, nor ever renewing this conversation.â€”Permit me to depart.â€”Lowly as I am, I have a right to be much offended at this insoâˆ£lent detension.

<P>Zella! I knew not that I should see you here;â€”therefore I could have formed no fixed plan of villainy; and when I declared my love, I had no settled intentions: I doted on you to distraction; I would have given the empire of the world to gain your heart. And if you would have listened to my

I never will be your Wife.â€”I must, as bound in honour and duty, communicate this conâˆ£versation to my Lord Marquis; and he will fix my future residence, where you, the Heir of all his titles, and the Representative of his illustrious House, shall never see me more.â€”Let your heart make a worthier choice. I will consecrate mine to my Maker, and dediâˆ£cate my future days to his service.

<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY De Sâ€”, Baron of Dâ€”, was betrothed to Eulalia De Lâ€”e, a Daughter of the Marquis De Lâ€”e. An offer more suitable to the ambiâˆ£tious views of the Marquis, being made to him, for his Daughter; he compelled her to write a refusal to her first Lover, which was accompanied by a perâˆ£emptory one from himself. The young Lord, unable to bear the thoughts of seeing the amiable woman he doated on given in marriage to another, secretly quitâˆ£ted his house; leaving a letter behind him, written in a style which indicated a mind bordering on despair and madness, declaring that all search after him would be in vain; desiring, in a formal manner, that his Kinsâˆ£man might, as his Heir, take possession of his Titles and Estate, giving to Eulalia De Lâ€”e, all the forâˆ£tune of which he had a right to dispose. Let her be told, adds the unhappy De Sâ€”, "that this must be looked on as a Brother's, not a Lover's gift: that Duty and Virtue forbid the Wife of the Duke of â€” to shed one tear of Love, to the Memory of the Baron De Sâ€”; let one wretched Victim to affection sufâˆ£fice
<PB N="382" REF="391"/>
â€”let him be forgotten.â€”May Heaven bless her. â€”Give her, great God! the happiness which might have fallen to my share!â€”add my date of days to hers!!â€”!"</P>
<P>When this young Nobleman disappeared, it was imagined from the whole tenor of his incoherent Letter, addressed to several friends, in different parts, but directed to no one; from his taking nothing of value with him, and leaving even his purse in his inkstand, that he left his house with an intention of putting an end to his Life. And, though after the most careful search, his body was not found, yet it was still believed that he had completed his shocking purpose.</P>
<P>Disguised in the Habit of a Pilgrim, Henry De Sâ€” went to the Abbey of La Trappe, in the Proâˆ£vince of Perche, in the diocese of SÃ©ez. He gained admission. And the Father Abbot immediately reâˆ£ceived him into the fraternity. The Rules of this order are more austere than those of any other of the Romish Church. Perpetual silence is enjoined to the Monks. They are allowed neither to receive nor write letters. None of their friends may see them, so that they are totally ignorant of what passes in the World. Their only food is Bread and Pulse; their drink Water. Meat, Fish, Eggs, Milk, Butter, Wine and Oil, are forbidden to them.â€”They are not alâˆ£lowed to study. The Bible, and a very few books of severe morality and self-denial, compose the whole Library of a Monk of La Trappe. They live a very
<PB N="383" REF="392"/>
laborious Life, cultivating the earth, or following some manual employment, such as they are found most fitted for. The Father Abbot only is allowed to speak. When they are in the last agonies of Life, they are placed on a Bier covered with Straw and Ashes; and carried into the Church. They lie on this Bier till they expire: and if they retain the power of speech, in this last strife of Nature, their Vow of Siâˆ£lence is dispensed with; in order that they may exâˆ£hort their Brethren: this permission has sometimes given rise to very affecting scenes and discoveries.</P>
<P>The uncommon severities which the young Baron De Sâ€” was obliged, by the Rules, to practise in the Monastery of La Trappe, injured his health. He had sound retirement, but not peace. The continual agitaâˆ£tions of his mind, which converse with the friendly part of the World might have relieved, disturbed his reason, after he had been in this gloomy solitude two years. The Monks of La Trappe dig a part of their Grave at certain stated hours: Whilst employed in this occupation, Henry's now weakened mind picâˆ£tured the form of his once-loved mistress sinking into it: This impression once made upon his imaginaâˆ£tion, constantly returned, at the same place, and time. His reason was not enough extinguished to make him suppose Eulalia really present; but the picture once formed by his disordered imagination was so strong, that he thought it a Vision: Impressed from this Idea, the coinage of his weakened reason, he determined, difficult and dangerous as the execution of such a
<PB N="384" REF="393"/>
design was, to escape from La Trappe: as he thought that Eulalia's appearance to him indicated a want of some assistance, which it might be in his power to give to her. Forbidden by the Rules of his order to speak but in prayer; and all the Brethren avoiding one another, except at Church, as much as possible; the state of Henry's mind, balancing between reason and madness, of which he himself at times was sensiâˆ£ble, escaped observation. He got away amongst a number of Pilgrims who came to La Trappe to perâˆ£form some acts of devotion; disguised in the very dress which he had on two years before, when he entered the Monastery.â€”How or where he parted from the other Pilgrims is not known.</P>
<P>After the second day's travelling, in the depth of a severe Winter, he was benighted, on a heath: he wandered there for some hours, till his strength and vital heat, spite of the hardships to which he was accustomed, were nearly exhausted, when his undirected steps brought him to the Convent of Meuâˆ£don. Father Hubert found him kneeling in the Portico of the Church, as he came out, from celeâˆ£brating Midnight Mass. The Benevolent Priest seeing a way-worn Pilgrim, at that time of the night, in such an unprotected situation, invited him to his Cell. After he had been refreshed there; confidence in the fame-known character of Father Hubert, despair, and the workings of a disordered imagination, joined to make him discover his wildly conceived design. Father Hubert attempted to win him from his purpose of
<PB N="385" REF="394"/>
pursuing his journey; he could not find which way he was bending his course, and he feared to ask him too many questions. Finding common persuafion, and what force he could oppose to him ineffectual, to deter him from continuing his journey; he feigned to suspect the real motive of it: but as the test of the purity of his intentions, Father Hubert offered himâˆ£self to be his conductor, if he would stay till the Noon of the coming day; as in the Morning he was obliged by his office, being Almorer, and Priest to the Conâˆ£vent, to attend and officiate in an extraordinary solemâˆ£nity, which was to be performed. Henry accepted of his offer, and, somewhat calmed, spent the remaining part of the night in prayer.</P>

<HEAD>THE MONK OF LA TRAPPE: A TALE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>How much is Man to pride a slave!</L>
<L>To compass an ambitious end,</L>
<L>Though he have godlike power to bless,</L>
<L>He acts the persecuting Fiend;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For sounding titles, pompous names,</L>
<L>That never gave one real joy,</L>
<L>His life is past in constant cares,</L>
<L>Which all his happiness annoy:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not only to himself severe,</L>
<L>When fierce ambition cruel reigns,</L>
<L>He heeds no touch from Nature's ties,</L>
<L>Nor dove-like pity's melting strains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He harms the Friend whom he esteems;</L>
<L>He seeks the Wretch his soul disproves;</L>
<L>He does the deed his heart arraigns,</L>
<L>E'en immolates the Child he loves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And shall no warning Voice prevail?</L>
<L>Will Man but by experience learn?</L>
<L>Experience, dear-bought by himself,</L>
<L>His real interest to discern?</L>
</LG>

<L>No!â€”from himself alone he learnsâ€”</L>
<L>The Ills which from ambition flow,</L>
<L>That all, but Virtue's heavenly charms,</L>
<L>Is Folly, Vanity, and Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Till he has tried the tortuous path,</L>
<L>Which blindfold he is doom'd to tread,</L>
<L>He thinks unhurt th' Ordeal to pass,</L>
<L>And tempts the danger he should dread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Passion blows the treacherous gale,</L>
<L>Reason and Prudence quit their post;</L>
<L>The Mind obeys the boisterous storm,</L>
<L>Unshipp'd its helm, its compass lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain the Muse,â€”e'en Heaven in vain,â€”</L>
<L>Point out the course it ought to steer;</L>
<L>Their warnings are unheeded all,</L>
<L>Till Fate allows no time to veer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet once again the Muse essays,</L>
<L>(Oh! may her warning voice prevail!)</L>
<L>To show Ambition's fatal Ills,</L>
<L>Her moral pointing, from a tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Sun appear'd to set in blood;</L>
<L>Dark gathering clouds deform'd the East;</L>
<L>O'er the lone wild a Pilgrim rov'd,</L>
<L>Nor saw, nor hop'd a place of rest.</L>

<L>'Twas bleak December's dreary night,</L>
<L>Frore snow and beating hail descend;</L>

<LG>
<L>Long had be trod the stiffen'd plain,</L>
<L>Fatigued, benumb'd with piercing cold;</L>

<L>A not far distant bell was toll'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Calm'd for a moment e'en his woes;</L>

<L>The Bell now ceas'dâ€”A striking Clock,</L>

<LG>
<L>Scarcely his weak'ned eye-balls bear</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Its lofty portico he gain'd,</L>

<L>And pious, kneel'd beneath its roof,</L>
<L>Whilst midnight Mass within was said.</L>

<L>The deep, full Organ's swelling sound,</L>

<L>Say, cries the kind benignant Sire,</L>

<L>Can I assistance lend to check,</L>

<LG>
<L>Thy Pilgrim's weeds, thy sandal'd feet,</L>

<L>Thy uncouth garb, thy Pilgrim's staff,</L>
<L>Might cheat an undiscerning eye;â€”</L>

<L>Aught of thy secrets to disclose:</L>
<L>Yet would I ease thy troubled heart.</L>

<L>Th' ingenuous blush of modest worth,</L>
<L>Glows nobly on thy downcast face;</L>
<L>Each tender Virtue's there express'd,</L>

<L>The awful front of Misery,</L>

<L>MARY! our Prayer being still the same,</L>
<L>A little Litany I frame.</L>
<L>The Wish, that dwells within each breast,</L>
<L>So early form'd, so oft express'd,</L>
<L>Is, by the Muse's favouring care,</L>
<L>At length reduc'd to Form of Prayer.</L>
<L>Sisters, who're Friends, like you and me,</L>
<L>Perhaps will join our Litany;</L>
<L>Whilst those, whose hearts know no such love,</L>
<L>Will from our Mode, Dissenters prove.</L>

<HEAD>PRAYER. TO THE PARCAE.</HEAD>

<L>Inexorable Triad! tell us! where,</L>
<L>In what vast Antre, or what Cypress grove,</L>
<L>Your gloomy Altars trembling Mortals rear;</L>
<L>And what the hallow'd Sacrifice ye love?</L>

<L>If ever your stern breasts relent at tears,</L>
<L>If ye have hearts that sighs can comprehend,</L>
<L>If ye can sympathize in human cares,</L>

<L>Two Sisters are we, who in life's rough way,</L>
<L>Full early enter'd 'neath a baneful Star,</L>
<L>Together, though unbless'd with one bright ray,</L>
<L>We bear the hardships of its constant war.</L>

<L>Companions still, the same our hopes and woes,</L>
<L>Sweet counsel seek we in each other's mind;</L>
<L>And the soft green, where harrass'd souls repose,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>No dearer Friendship, and no separate Joy,</L>
<L>Has e'er estrang'd us from each other's heart,</L>
<L>No Strife has ever mingled its alloy,</L>
<L>In Good, or Ill, each had a Sister's part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Together we retrace our sorrows past,</L>
<L>With that sweet interest only Sisters feel,</L>
<L>Hope's bright'ning beam upon the future cast,</L>
<L>Or present Ills participating heal.</L>

<L>Such, ye stern Parcae! are your Suppliants now;</L>

<L>We ask not Wealth, nor Honours for our brow;</L>
<L>Unmurmuring have we liv'd without them still.</L>

<L>Nor do we ask exemption from all Grief;</L>
<L>Patient we bow to an o'erwhelming share;</L>
<L>There is but One,â€”for which there's no relief,</L>
