is an Instance of Both, so much to my Advantage, that I find it im∣possible, to suppress either my Pride, or Gratitude, on this Occa∣sion; especially when I consider that it is an Honour, that many before have Solicited in vain.</P>
<P>That the Conversation and Friend∣ship of a Lady of your Accomplish∣ments, should be highly Esteemed by Persons of the first Rank both for Dignity and Virtue (not to mention the Noble Lord to whom you are so happily Ally'd) is no more a Wonder, than that there should be among the Nobility, those who are as eminent for their good Sense and fine Taste, as their high Stations.</P>

<P>When Love's sincere and constant, how does it bless and how improve Mankind? yet, ambitious Statesmen, and foolish medling Priests, wou'd bind in Fetters the noble free-born Pas∣sion.

<P>This idle Talk, this common-place Raillery on Mar∣riage, I think, at any Time is best omitted; but sure, Sir <HI>John,</HI> 'tis most improper now.

<P>Wou'd I had never heard you. Oh that 'twere possible to fly where I might never hear the Voice of Mankind more!—What, set a Price on my Immortal Soul and spotless Fame? Know, thou ungenerous Man, I ne'er was influenced by thy Wealth to hearken to thy Vows; for notwithstanding my humble Birth, and Fortune, I ever scorn'd Riches, when com∣par'd to Love, as now I do Love and Thee, compar'd to Virtue. She, who capitulates on Terms like these, confesses an Equivalent may be had for Innocence and Fame, and there by forfeits both.</P>

<P>I have made a bold, but unsuccessful Attempt, and by it, perhaps, have lost her for ever—perhaps not.—I wou'd fain see her once more, methinks.—And yet there is but little likelyhood of our coming to an Agreement. I am resolv'd ne∣ver to marry; and she seems as much resolv'd never to comply without it. Whatever is the Meaning of it, I find my self more asham'd than angry at the Disappointment. Tho' 'tis certain that I never did, nor ever can, love any other Woman half so well. I feel a strange Palpitation here!
<STAGE>[Sighing.]</STAGE>
I am not sure that I don't like her the better for refusing me.—I am sure of nothing—but that I won't marry—I must e'en have recourse to the general Remedy in these Cases, a less scrupulous Female. For tho' that won't remove the Cause, yet it is an admirable Opiate, and relieves the Symp∣toms to a Miracle.</P>

<P>A very pretty Fancy this of being buried in her Cloaths. If it were once a Fashion, a <HI>Sexton</HI> might get as much as an Overseer of the Poor. Every Man is for making the most of his Place. But then there is no Comparison between starv∣ing the Living and robbing the Dead, for what shou'd dead Folks do with Cloaths?—But the Truth of it is, in these healthy Countries the Poor live so shamefully long, that Parish-Officers get little now, beside good Eating and Drinking.—But I have heard that formerly such as were past their Labour, used to be provided for at the Expence of the Sheriff,—for then, if Persons were likely to become chargeable to the Parish, the

<P>Sir <HI>John,</HI> I have a Daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have, a fair one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, she is fair; but her Beauty is her least Perfe∣ction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the Bloom of Youth she hath Wisdom, Prudence, and Modesty, beyond what I have observ'd in the most venera∣ble Old Age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to crown all, an inflexible Virtue, that sets her as much above Temptation from Flattery, Wealth, or Power, as they are beneath her true Value.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is, indeed, the <HI>Phoenix</HI> of her Sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis no Boasting, but modest Truth in a Father to say she is. Then where is your Judgment, or Gratitude? Have I not preferr'd you to many Gentlemen of superior Merit and Fortune, in your Addresses to my <HI>Silvia</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own the Obligation, and—but that I am re∣solv'd never to marry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not marry, Sir! Why 'tis a Debt due to your An∣cestors—you are the Medium 'twixt them and Posterity, which in you must fail unless prevented by a prudent and timely Choice; and an ample Estate, obtain'd by their Industry, be possess'd by Strangers to their Blood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to my Ancestors, they have had their time, as I now have mine; they liv'd to please themselves, and so will I. As to Posterity, I shall not trouble my self about what I know nothing of, and which may or may not be, notwithstand∣ing all the Care we can take about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since I find, what I hop'd had been only the Warmth of Youth, to be Principles with you, you are justly accounta∣ble for their Consequences.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding your present Circumstances, I look upon you as a Gentleman. In your Youth, as a Soldier of Fortune, you had Opportunities of knowing the World be∣yond most Men; which, join'd to your good Sense and just Observation, qualifies you to give Advice the best of any Man I know. And I appeal to your own Experience, whether Mar∣riage be not a state of Life, attended with innumerable Cares, Disappointments, and Inquietudes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true I have found it so; and you, by your living so many Years in my House in your Youth, was frequently an Eye∣witness
<PB N="44" REF="54"/>
witness of this sad Truth: And I farther confess that my se∣cret Troubles (which were the greater for being so) far ex∣ceeded all that ever were visible; but those are not essential to a married State, but might have been prevented by a more pru∣dent Choice. But as it was, one darling Child, not only made them easy, but far o'er-paid them all. [Tho' Heaven knows that Child is now my greatest Trouble.]
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>

Our greatest Care and Trouble is over then, for the Men, who seldom take any before, are bound to do it then.</P>

<P>Suppose I did, Goody <HI>Costive,</HI> where is the Harm of that? I am sure, Times are so bad, that what with one thing, and what with another, an honest Woman, in my way of Business, can hardly get Bread; and I never expect to see it otherwise, while Matrimony is so much despised as it is; why, the Men are grown so horrible cunning, that few of them will marry at all; and the Women are grown so forward, that they won't stay till they are married.—But you are melancholy, Mrs. <HI>Silvia.</HI></P>

<P>It is not that which I complain of; for, to say the Truth, I don't find but that single People have as many Chil∣dren as those that are married; but then they are such Infidels, as to let their Children dye without Christening, and what signi∣fies, to the Midwife, a Lying-in, without a Christening?—I had once some Thoughts of going to <HI>London,</HI> but I am in∣formed that it is worse there than here; for there are, it seems,

<P>My Master is a single Man, and won't keep any Body that is married in his Family.</P>

<P>Ay, Shame take these Gentlefolks; they would have every Body as bad as themselves. That must be a sad House, that has never an honest Woman in it.</P>

<P>We live as they do in most Batchelors Families, very lovingly. While my Master is entertaining the House-keeper in his Chamber, I am as civil to the Cook-maid in the Garret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Busy.</SPEAKER>
<P>O sad, O sad! what pity it is that young Men should spend their Time unfruitfully with naughty Women; when, were they honestly married, they might in a lawful way do much good in their Generation. If you have any Thoughts of Marriage, I have a Widow in my Eye, that would do very well for you. She has something to bring you to, and is un∣der Thirty I assure you. While her Husband was in Health, she brought him a Child every Year; but I don't know how it fell out, he grew weary of her, and, as it is suppos'd, thought to have kill'd her with Kindness: but as it always happens in those Cases, he did his own Business instead of hers, he fell in∣to a Consumption—and dy'd about a Month ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jon.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Goody <HI>Busy,</HI> that will never do for me; a wanton young Widow for a Wife, and a skittish Horse for a long Journey, are two the most troublesome things a Man can meet withal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Busy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you would rather have a Maid. Truly they are ticklish things, and I don't much care to meddle or make with 'em. But I do know of a Farmer's Daughter, that will fit you to a Hair. Her Father is a sufficient Man, and will stock a Farm for you. 'Tis true, indeed, she has had one Child; for I am a Woman of Integrity, and would not deceive any Body in these matters for the World. They did not marry her soon enough. But she'll make an excellent stirring Wife, I'll warrant her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jon.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Maid that has had a Child, is worse than a Widow that's past it. I don't like any Body that you have propos'd half so well as yourself.</P>

<P>If this Gentleman be your Son, how could his Birth have been conceal'd so long?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That—with my own Shame, I am now to discover.—My Wife, while unmarry'd, attended on the Mother of this Lady, then a Virgin, and so far was she honour'd with her Confidence, that she liv'd with her rather as a Sister or Com∣panion than a Servant; after her Marriage to Sir <HI>John,</HI> and my Wife's to me, the Honour of their Friendship was continu'd; for I was happy in Sir <HI>John</HI>'s, as my Wife was in his Lady's.—That we had the same number of Children, and of the same Age and Sex, and that my Wife was entrusted with the Care of theirs, you have heard already.—Soon after the Birth of this Lady, a War breaking out, Sir <HI>John,</HI> who had an honou∣rable Post in the Army, went for <HI>Flanders</HI>: I attended him thither, and (as I had formerly done) serv'd under him as a Vo∣luntier.—In this our Absence, a Fever made dreadful Ravage in this part of the Country.—Of it dy'd Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Lady, and quickly after his Son, (who was then at my House) and my Daughter.—My Wife taking the Advantage of the Lady's Death, and our Absence, reported, that the Son who dy'd was ours; and the surviving one (truly ours) was Sir <HI>John</HI>'s.—Our Daughter who dy'd was bury'd as his; and his, this Lady, was reputed and educated as our own—The Fraud was never so much as suspected by Sir <HI>John,</HI> nor any other Person, my self excepted—I indeed, by Observa∣tions, which none else had opportunity to make, soon found it out, and charg'd my Wife with it; she confess'd it, and to my Shame prevail'd upon me to conceal what I could never approve.—She dy'd before Sir <HI>John,</HI> and never liv'd to see her Son possess'd of the Honour and Wealth, which she by such wicked Means had endeavour'd to procure for him.—Thro' Heav'n's Mercy I hope she rests in Peace. But what have been my Tortures e'er since I consented to conceal the
<PB N="73" REF="83"/>
guilty Secret!—Stung hourly with Remorse, I attempted to do her Justice and conceal my Shame, by effecting a Marriage between her and my Son; but Heaven, that refus'd the imper∣fect Satisfaction, and condemn'd the Fraud, has, you see, made vain the fond Attempt, nor would suffer her to receive that as another's Gift, which is her own proper Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And long may she enjoy it.—I have not so ill profited by her bright Example, as to repine at a Change of Fortune, so just, and so much to the Advantage of this won∣drous Pattern of all that's excellent in Womankind.</P>
</SP>
