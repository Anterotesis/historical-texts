<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving been employed on a Voyage into the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> under the Command of Capt. <HI>Dampier,</HI> in the Year 1703, and having
<PB REF="3"/>
both in that Expedition, and in my Return by the Eastern∣part of the South-Sea, and through the <HI>Indian</HI>-Ocean, re∣marked not only faithfully, but with all the Accuracy I could, whatever I conceived might be serviceable, or instructive to such as should hereafter sail into those Parts, I hope you will pardon my Presuption in laying my said Observations before you.</P>
<P>I humbly take the Liberty to represent to you, that I have launched forth into no Descrip∣tions, or particular Accounts of Things, which the Course of my Voyage gave me not sufficient Opportunity to be
<PB REF="4"/>
fully and perfectedly instructed in, and I spared no Pains in the setting them down, toge∣ther with Draughts of such Places as I had time or conve∣nience of taking; and in all this I have not through any de∣sign of contradicting others, or in hopes thereby to recommend my own Performance, either opposed or slighted any good and true Observations which have already been made by those who have heretofore visited any of the same Places. This I presume to mention, with a particular regard to the most material of Captain <HI>Dampier</HI>'s own Observations, formerly published, which I found by
<PB REF="5"/>
Experience to be true: But I hope I may, without breach of Modesty, declare that I have remarked several things both new and useful, which the un∣common Course we steared, and the unusual Accidents we met with, gave me particular Opportunities to enquire into.</P>
<P>Sir, I am not pretending to a meritorious Claim of your Protection, but am encourag'd to hope for it from your known Candour and Goodness: And it is very natural to flatter our selves, that Persons of your Judgment and Experience in Maritime Affairs, will look with a more favourable Eye,
<PB REF="6"/>
even on our meanest Endea∣vours, than those can be ex∣pected to do, who know but little of those Matters, and are apt to prefer superficial Ac∣counts, which are frequently very erroneous, before the most useful, though less diverting. However it be, if I can be so happy as to receive any coun∣tenance from your distinguish∣ing Judgment, or at least your Pardon for this my Boldness, I shall not fear that any Opini∣on or Prejudice of less discern∣ing Persons, can discredit the Truth, or Usefulness of my Observations.</P>
<P>I am sensible, Sir, how lit∣tle I ought to encroach upon
<PB REF="7"/>
your Time, which is so usefully and so diligently employed: And therefore I humbly beg leave to conclude with subscri∣bing my self,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your HONOURS most Dutiful, most Obedient, and most Humble Servant, <HI>William Funnell.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE Voyages and Descrip∣tions formerly published by Captain <HI>William Dampier,</HI> have met with so good Reception and universal Approbation in the World; and there has been so general an Ex∣pectation of the Success of the present Expedition, under the Command of a Person so perfectly acquainted with those Parts of the World to which we were
<PB REF="9"/>
bound, and so well skilled in the Trade, Shipping, Customs and Designs of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> against whom we were employed; that I presume there needs no Apology, for publishing the following Ac∣count.</P>
<P>The Success indeed of our Ex∣pedition, was not such as might at first have been expected from the Skill of our Commander and the Resolution of our Men. Disa∣greements and Mismanagements having broken our Measures, and defeated our most promising Hopes; as they have often been Occasions of the miscarriage of the greatest and noblest Attempts.</P>
<P><PB REF="10"/>
But though we failed in our chief Designs; yet the great Va∣riety of Accidents we met with, and the many Discoveries we made, and particular Accounts of the manner how our Attempts miscarried, I hope cannot but be very acceptable to the inquisitive Reader.</P>
<P>I have chosen not to be large in the Descriptions of Towns and Places, of which others have already given us sufficient Accounts. But the whole Western Coast of <HI>America,</HI> from the South∣end of <HI>California</HI> to the Port of <HI>Valdivia,</HI> which is above sixty Degrees, I have given one con∣tinued and much more particular
<PB REF="11"/>
Description of, than has ever yet been made publick; and also I have given an exact Account of the Variation of the Compass upon the whole Coast. And though it may perhaps by some be thought not so pleasant and entertaining, as Descriptions of the Country within Land; yet it cannot but be much more useful, especially to such as shall hereafter sail into those Parts.</P>
<P>And here I cannot in justice but take notice, that upon all this Coast, and during our whole stay in the South Seas, we found Captain <HI>Dampier</HI>'s Descriptions of Places very exact; and his
<PB REF="12"/>
Account of Winds, Currents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> very extraordinary.</P>
<P>After our parting from Capt. <HI>Dampier</HI> in the Gulf of <HI>Ama∣palla,</HI> and running over to <HI>In∣dia;</HI> we met, as with many Hardships, so also with some Variety of new Discoveries, in our wandering among un∣known Spice-Islands: And par∣ticularly the Misfortunes, which necessitated us to put in at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> where we were de∣tained Prisoners by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> gave me an opportunity of ma∣king such Enquiries into the State, Government, Product, Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of that Island,
<PB REF="13"/>
as I perswade my self will be very acceptable to the ingenious Reader.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE were at first Two Ships, of Twenty-six Guns and One hun∣dred and twenty Men each; design∣ed
<PB N="2" REF="26"/>
for the South-Seas: The one was named the St <HI>George,</HI> Captain <HI>Willi∣am Dampier</HI> Commander, on Board of which I was; and the other was na∣med the <HI>Fame, John Pulling</HI> Captain. We were each of us supplied with all War-like Stores, and very well victualled for nine Months; and had Commissions from his Royal Highness the Lord High-Admiral, to proceed in a War-like man∣ner against the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards:</HI> And we Both were upon the same Terms, of no Purchase no Pay. But whilst we were in the <HI>Downs,</HI> there arising some Difference between the two Captains, Captain <HI>Pulling</HI> in his Ship the <HI>Fame</HI> went away and left us; intending, as he said, to go and cruize among the <HI>Canary-Islands;</HI> and we never saw him after. But before our going away from <HI>Ireland,</HI> we were joyned by another Ship sent after us on purpose. She was a small Ship, named the <HI>Cinque-ports</HI> Gally, burthen about ninety Tuns, sixteen Guns, and sixty three Men, <HI>Charles Pickering</HI> Captain: Which Ship was also very well victualled and provided for the said Voyage. Our Proposals were to go into the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> to <HI>Buonas Aires,</HI> to take two or three <HI>Spanish</HI> Galleons which Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> gives an account are usually there: And if by that Expediti∣on we got to the value of 600000 Pounds,
<PB N="3" REF="27"/>
then to return again without proceeding further: But if we missed of Success there, then to cruize upon the Coast of <HI>Peru,</HI> for the <HI>Valdivia</HI> Ships, which commonly are said to bring down store of Gold to <HI>Lima:</HI> But if that Design should also fail, then to attempt some rich Towns, accord∣ing as Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> should think fit: And after that, we were at the usual time of the Year to go down upon the Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to seek for a great Galleon, which Trades from <HI>Manila,</HI> one of the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, to <HI>Acapulco</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Mexi∣co;</HI> and which is commonly reported to be worth thirteen or fourteen Millions of Pieces of Eight. The Reason we did not go to <HI>Buonas Aires,</HI> was because upon our arrival at <HI>Madera,</HI> we had advice that the Galleons before-mentioned were arrived at <HI>Teneriff.</HI> The Success of our other De∣signs, are set down particularly in the fol∣lowing Relation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> On the 30<HI>th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 1703, we sailed out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> and on the 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> anchored at <HI>Kingsale</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Here we refitted and victualled our Ship; and were joined by another Ship named the <HI>Cinque-ports,</HI> burthen about ninety Tuns, sixteen Guns, and sixty three Men, <HI>Charles Pickering</HI> Captain: And on the 11th of

<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> <HI>September,</HI> we in company of our Consort Captain <HI>Pckering,</HI> left <HI>Kingsale,</HI> and on the 25th we reached the Island of <HI>Madera,</HI> where we did not anchor, but lay off and on for our Boats, which were sent ashore for some Necessaries. By a good observa∣tion I make this Island to lye in the Lati∣tude of 32 d. 20 m. <HI>N.</HI> And Longitude by my account from <HI>London, W.</HI> 18 d. 5 m. It is a very pleasant Island, inhabi∣ted by <HI>Portugueze;</HI> it abounds in Corn, Wine, Honey, Sugar, Madder, Oranges, Lemons, Pomegranets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Having done our Business here, we de∣parted <HI>Sept.</HI> 28, and on the 30th saw <HI>Pal∣ma</HI> and <HI>Fero,</HI> the two Westermost of the <HI>Canary</HI>-Islands, they being in all seven, so called from <HI>Canaria</HI> the Chief; They are also called <HI>Fortunate,</HI> from their Fruitful∣ness, being plentiful in several sorts of Commodities, but especially in the Wine called <HI>Canary,</HI> brought from hence in a∣bundance. We did not stop here, but made the best of our way for the <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> Islands; and <HI>October</HI> the 6th saw the Island of <HI>Mayo,</HI> lying in the Latitude of 15 d. 10 m. <HI>N.</HI> and Longitude from <HI>London, W.</HI> 24 d. 29 m. The chief o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what this Island produces, is Salt; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which here is plenty for fetching.

<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> get off any, because here ran so great a Surf that we durst not venture our Boats ashore. So <HI>October</HI> the seventh, in the Morning, we bore away for the Island St <HI>Jago,</HI> and at Noon anchored at <HI>Prior Bay.</HI> This Bay lies in the Latitude of 14 d. 50 m. <HI>N.</HI> and West from <HI>London</HI> 24 d. 47 m.</P>
<P>This is one of the Southermost and most fruitful of the <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> Islands; it a∣bounding in Hogs, Fowls, <HI>Guinea</HI>-Hens, Monkies, Maiz, Oranges, Lemons, Dates, Water-melons, Plantains, Bonanoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is good Water to be had, but trouble∣some fetching of it; and Wood is very dear, by reason of its scarcity. The Na∣tives of this place were formerly <HI>Portu∣gueze,</HI> who were banished to this place for Murthers, Thefts, and other Villanies; but now they are mostly black, by reason of their Converse amongst their Women∣slaves (which are <HI>Guinea Negroes;</HI>) And although they have changed their Colour, yet they still retain their Vices; thieving being commoner here than in any place I have been in; insomuch that they will take your Hat off your Head at Noon-day, although you be in the midst of Company. You must also be very wary how you Trade with them; for if you let them have <HI>your</HI> Goods, before you have <HI>theirs,</HI> you will
<PB N="6" REF="30"/>
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> be sure to lose them. At this place we was ter'd our Ship and refresh'd our selves; and here being some Disagreement between our Captain and first Lieutenant, our Cap∣tain turned him ashore with his Chest and and Cloaths and Servant, much against both their Wills, about twelve at Night. At four the next Morning, it being the 13th of <HI>October,</HI> we parted from the said Island, not fully resolved what place to touch at next. On <HI>October</HI> the 22d (being in the Latitude of 6 d. 36 m. <HI>N.</HI> and Longitude from <HI>London W.</HI> about 19 d. 57 m.) we caught four Fish; a Shark, a Dolphin, a Jelly-fish and an Old-wife.</P>
<P>The <HI>Shark</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See FIG.

It is so fierce a Fish, that when it wants its Prey, it will seize upon any thing, and make nothing of taking off a Man's Leg at a bite or two. He hath two Stones between his Eyes, which are accounted very good if taken inwardly by any one that has the Stone or Gravel. These Stones we com∣monly take out and give to our Doctor, who makes use of them as he finds occasi∣on: When they are taken out of the Head,

<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> they are a perfect Jelly; but being laid in the Sun and dryed, they look like damp Chalk. The Shark is usually attended with one, two, three, or more small Fish (about the bigness of an ordinary Whi∣ting) which go before him and show him his Prey; They are called Pylot-fish, and look very pretty in the Water; they will play about him, be he never so hun∣gry; and he never offers to prey upon them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolphin</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See FIG. II.</NOTE> is between four and five feet in length, some more, some less. It is a very pretty coloured Fish, and very good to eat, but something dry; They feed mostly upon Flying-fish, a sort of Fish about the bigness of an ordinary Herring, and much like one; the <HI>Dolphins</HI> are so nimble, as to catch them when they light in the Water to wet their Wings, or rather Fins. For they can fly no longer than their Wings are wet, but then fall into the Water and mount again. It is very pretty to see what shifts and turns they will make, to get clear of their great Ene∣my the Dolphin; and rather than be taken by them, they will often fly into a ship; but when they are in, unless they happen to fall into a puddle of Water they cannot fly out again, for want of moisture in their Wings.</P>

He had one small Fin under his Jaw, of the same slimy Sub∣stance. That part of him which is with∣out small spots, is a perfect green <HI>Jelly,</HI> whence he was called by us a <HI>Jelly-fish:</HI> The rest of him was firm, of a Silver colour, with small spots, and streaks or partings, as is exprest in the <HI>Figure.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Old-wife</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. IV.</NOTE> was a Fish about two foot long, and 9 Inches high; He hath a small Mouth, a large Eye; a great Fin on his back, beginning at the hinder part of his Head, and stretching to his Tail; he hath a large broad Fin on each side near the Gills, with one pretty large one under his Belly; his Body is of a deep Blue, and his Fins of a very light Blue, the ends of which are Yellow.

<P><PB N="10" REF="37"/>
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> There are three of the Islands, called by the name of St <HI>Anns,</HI> not above a Stones cast from each other; they are very full of Wood, as is all the <HI>Brasilian</HI> Coast.

I have made many a Meal of this sort of Birds, but it was for want of other Victuals; They taste very Fishy; and if you do not salt them very well before you eat them, they will make you sick; They are so silly, that when they are weary of flying, they will, if you hold out your Hand, come and sit upon it: From thence I conjecture that they are called <HI>Boobies.</HI></P>

About three Miles from this place is the main Land, all very moun∣tainous and woody, where is a small Town of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> (called by the name of <HI>Le Grand</HI> Town), who come out of the Country for forty or fifty Miles round on Saint <HI>Andrews</HI> day, to pay their Devotions to that Saint, here being a small Church consecrated to his use. They abide here about fourteen Days, and then return to their own Dwellings. Here is Rum, Su∣gar, and several sorts of Indian Fruits to be had, but very dear by reason of their supplying the Town of St <HI>Pauls</HI> with these Necessaries; near which Town is said to be a Gold-mine, accounted one of the richest yet known. It is distant from the Town of <HI>Le Grand</HI> about three hundred Miles; and is reckoned, by reason of the difficulty of the way and the vast high Mountains that intercept the passage, to be sixty days journey.

<P>AT this Island of <HI>Juan Fernando</HI>'s we wooded, water'd, heel'd and refitted our Ships. Here Captain <HI>Stradling</HI> and his Crew having some difference, they to the number of forty two went on shoar;

<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> so that for two Days, the Ship lay as it were without Men; But by the endea∣vours of Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> they were again reconciled, and returned aboard their own Ship again.</P>
<P>This Island is so called from the first Discoverer of it, who was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> na∣med <HI>Juan</HI> or <HI>John Fernando.</HI> It is about fourteen Leagues round; full of high Hills, and small pleasant Valleys. The Woods afford several sorts of Trees, but none fit for Masts.

<P>The Cabbage-tree<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XI.</NOTE> is of Body small and streight, with several Knots or Joynts about four Inches from each other, like a Bamboe-Cane, void of any Leaves, except at the top; in the midst of which, the Cabbage is contained; which when boiled, is as good as any Garden-Cabbage I ever tasted. The Branches are commonly a∣bout twelve or thirteen Feet in length, and about a foot and an half from the Trunk of the Tree they shoot forth Leaves, about four foot long, and an Inch and a half broad. These Leaves grow so regu∣larly that the whole Branch seems but one entire Leaf. The Cabbage when it is cut out from amongst the bottoms of the

<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> Branches, is commonly about six Inches about, and a foot long; some more, some less; and is as white as Milk. At the bot∣tom of the Cabbage grow great Bunches of Berries, of about six pound weight, in the shape of a bunch of Grapes. Their Colour is red like a Cherry; and the Ber∣ries are about the bigness of a black Cher∣ry, with a large Stone in the middle; and they taste much like <HI>English</HI> Haws. We never climb up to get the Fruit or Cabbage, be∣cause the Tree is so high, and there is not any thing to hold by; so that a Man would find it a hard matter to get up. For I have seen some of these Trees, after we we have cut them down (which we always do to get the Cabbage) to be ninety or a hundred Feet in length.</P>
<P>There are in this Island a great many <HI>Wild-Cats,</HI> of the finest Colour I ever saw, which were put ashoar here (as I suppose) by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to destroy the Goats: But their Project has not taken effect; for here are vast numbers of <HI>Goals.</HI> The old ones, both Male and Female, take turns to guard their Young; so that the Cats durst not venture upon the Young, the old ones being always their Guard. I wonder the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should think that by setting Cats ashoar here, they should destroy the Goats; when at the same time there are such vast numbers of <HI>Seales</HI> both young
<PB N="20" REF="50"/>
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> and old, on whom the Cats may more easily prey, because they cannot so well defend their young as the Goats do: I have heard of mad Dogs being put ashoar here by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for the same intent, but never saw any. Yet if they were, I am apt to believe they would rather prey upon the Seals than the Goats.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Goats,</HI> as I said before, here is great plenty, and especially towards the West part of the Island; they resort thither, by reason there is better Pasture for them. Of these Goats we used to get store; and a Joint of one of them roasted, with about half a foot of our Cabbage boiled makes a very good Meal. I have heard Captain <HI>Martin</HI> tell of some <HI>French</HI> Pirates who were in these Seas, that having been sometime cruizing up and down, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meeting with a sufficient Booty, and being every where discovered by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and out of hopes of getting any more they concluded to come to this Island o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Juan Fernando's,</HI> they being twenty in number, and there to lie nine or ten Months; which accordingly they did, and landed on the West side of the Island▪ then drew there little Armadilla ashoar and in a small time brought the Goats t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be so tame, as that they would many o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them come of themselves to be milked▪ of which Milk they made good Butter an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="21" REF="51"/>
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> Cheese, not only just to supply their Wants whilst they were upon the Island, but also to serve them long after; and that after they had continued here ten Months, they launched their little Man of War, went upon the Coast of <HI>Peru,</HI> and off the Bay of <HI>Arica</HI> met with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship and took her, in which was said to be two hundred thousand Pieces of Eight, with about the value of half as much more in gold double Doubloons.</P>
<P>Birds here are few or none of Note, ex∣cept the <HI>Humming-Bird,</HI> which is about the bigness of a Bee. It hath a Bill no bigger than an ordinary Pin; his Legs are small, but in proportion to his Bulk; his Feathers are very small, and mostly black. We seldom used to catch or see these Birds, unless toward Evening; and then they would come humming about us: But if it was dark, and we had a Fire, before Mor∣ning we should have a hundred of them fly into the Fire.</P>
<P>Of the Sea Inhabitants here are <HI>Seals</HI> in such abundance, that without driving them away, there is no going ashoar. Here are also a great many <HI>Sea-Lyons;</HI> and for Cavallies, Silver-fish, Groopers, Breams and Craw-fish, here is such great plenty, that it is almost incredible.</P>
<P>The Sea-Lyon is so called (as I conje∣cture) because his roaring is not unlike
<PB N="22" REF="52"/>
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> that of the Lyon; the Head likewise much resembles the Lyon. He hath four large Teeth before; the rest thick, short and stubbed. In this he is like the Lyon; in all other parts quite different; He hath four Fins; the two foremost serve him, when he goes ashoar, to raise the fore-part of his Body, and then he draws the hinder-part after him; the two hinder Fins are of no use to him on Land, but only in the Wa∣ter. These Creatures are very fat; for which reason we kill'd several of them, and soon made us a Tun of Oil for our Lamps; although most of us, whilst we were here, made use of it in frying of Fish; and indeed it had no unpleasant taste. We killed one which was twenty three Feet in length, fourteen foot and a half round, and cut seventeen Inches deep in fat. They have short Hair, of a light Colour, but lighter when young, than old; For when old, they look more san∣dy. Their Food is Fish; for their prey is all in the Water, though they generally come on Land to sleep; and then five, six or seven of them will huddle together like Swine, and lie so three or four Days if not molested. They are very much afraid of a Man; and so soon as they see him any thing near, they will make to the Wa∣ter; for they never go far from it. If they are hard pursued, they will turn about and
<PB N="23" REF="53"/>
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> raise their Body up with their Fore-fins, and face you, standing with their Mouth wide open upon their Guard: So that when we wanted to kill one, to make Oil, we used commonly to clap a Pistol just to his Mouth, as it stood open, and fire it down his Throat; But if we had a mind to have some Sport with him, which we called Lyon-baiting; usually six, seven or eight, or more of us, would go with each a half Pike in his Hand, and so prick him to Death; which commonly would be a Sport for two or three Hours before we could conquer him. And often times he would find us work enough. But he being an unweildy Creature; and we assaulting him both behind, before, and all round; we must needs conquer. Yet he often put us to the run; and sometimes he would run himself, but knew not which way, for we commonly got beeween the Water and him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seals</HI> are much of the same kind; only their Heads are like a Hounds. They howl like Dogs, when old; and bark like them, when young. They have a very fine Furr; the finest, next the Sable, I ever saw. Some of them are of a bright Silver∣colour, some of a Chest-nut. They feed as the Sea-lion, being Both amphibious Creatures; and sleep like them; only when they go, their hinder as well as fore-fins
<PB N="24" REF="54"/>
<MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="year"/> are of use to them. They are about the bigness of a large Mastiff. They are very fat, but not the best Victuals. When they come out of the Sea, they bleat like Sheep for their Young; which, though they are to pass through Thousands both young and old, yet will find out their own Damm to suck; For none of them will suffer any Young to suck them, but only their own. Both young and old love much to lie ashoar; but when beaten by us, they make to the Sea; and a small blow on the Nose soon kills them. I have eaten of these Seals often, but it was to save better Victuals; however they eat to∣lerably well, to those that are very hun∣gry and have no other Meat. The Lean of the Flesh is black, and of a course Grain.</P>
<P>The <HI>Silver-fish</HI> here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XII.</NOTE> is quite different from those at <HI>Brasil,</HI> both in shape and substance; This having but six Fins, <HI>viz.</HI> four large ones, two upon his Back, and two opposite under his Belly; and one small one on each side near his Gills. It hath a small Eye, and a great Bottle-nose. It is a very fleshy Fish, and the Flesh is ex∣traordinary white and good; they are commonly about twelve or thirteen Inches long, and about seven Inches deep; with a half-mooned Tail, as is expressed in the Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="55"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> <HI>February</HI> the 29th 1704, at Noon we saw a Sail: So we got on board all our People, got up our Yards and Topmasts; and he being pretty near, we clapt our Long-Boat on our Moorings, let slip, and got under sail. He seeing us get under sail, tackt and stood from us; and we made the best of our way after him; and our Consort made what haste he could after us; and about eleven at Night we came close up with him, but did not think con∣venient to engage till Day. In this chace our Pinnace towed under Water; so we cut her loose. Captain <HI>Stradling</HI>'s Boat also broke loose, and in her was a Man and a Dog. At Sun-rise the next Mor∣ning, being <HI>March</HI> the 1st, we began to engage the said Ship; which was a <HI>French</HI> Ship of about four hundred Tuns, and thirty Guns, well-mann'd. We fought her very close, broad-side and broad-side, for seven Hours; and then a small Gale spring∣ing up, she shear'd off. As for our Consort, he fir'd about ten or twelve Guns, and then fell a Stern, and never came up again during the Fight. We had nine of our Men killed in the Fight, and several wounded. We were desirous to have the other Tryal with him, knowing it would be of dangerous Consequence to let him go; for if we did, we were sure he would discover us to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which would
<PB N="26" REF="56"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> be of ill Consequence to our whole Proceed∣ings: But our Captain was against it, saying, that at the worst, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should know of our being in those Seas, and so should hinder their Merchant-ships from coming out, yet that he knew where to go and could not fail of taking to the value of 500000 <HI>l.</HI> any Day in the Year. Upon this we lay by for our Con∣sort, who soon came up; And it was quickly agreed between the two Captains to let her go. So the Enemy stood from us, I suppose very well satisfied that he had disappointed us both: And we were very much dissatisfied that we should suffer our selves to be so baffled in our first Attempt: But however, since it was so, we conclu∣ded to return to <HI>Juan Fernando</HI>'s, to get our Anchors, Cables, Long-boats, and se∣veral Tun of Water casked, with a Tun of Sea-Lions Oyl, which we had left there: And Captain <HI>Stradling</HI> had left five of his Men, who were gone to the West part of the Island, and knew nothing of our going out after the Enemy. He had also left behind him all his Sails, except those at the Yards, with a great many other Stores. Accordingly we stood away towards the said Island; and on the 3d saw the Island bearing South, distant about nine or ten Leagues. We had then the Wind at South, right off the Land; so that we found it
<PB N="27" REF="57"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> very difficult to get up with it. But it falling calm, the <HI>Cinque-ports</HI> put out her Oars, and rowed towards the Island. Pre∣sently after which, we saw two Sail. The <HI>Cinque-ports</HI> was pretty near them, and they fired at her several shots; but she rowed away to us, and gave us an account that they were two <HI>French</HI> Ships, each of about thirty six Guns: So the two Captains thought it convenient not to go in, but to go away for the Coast of <HI>Peru;</HI> leaving be∣hind Capt. <HI>Stradling</HI>'s five Men, with other Necessaries that we could ill spare: For now we had neither of us any Boats. How∣ever, according to their Agreement, on <HI>March</HI> the 6th, we stood away for the Coast of <HI>Peru;</HI> and on the 11th fell in with the Land; it being very high, three rows of Hills one within another; that to∣wards the Water lowest, and that towards the Land highest. We were then in the Latitude of 24 d. 53 m. S. From thence we coasted along shore to the Northward; and on the 14th past by the Port of <HI>Copiapo,</HI> whose Latitude is 21 d. 00 m. S. We observed here, and found the Variati∣on by AZ<HI>th</HI> Compass to be 2 d. 50 m. Easterly.</P>
<P>This is said to be a very good Port, and to be fenced from almost all Winds. Near to the Port are four or five Rocks; and with∣in Land it is inhahited by <HI>Indians,</HI> who
<PB N="28" REF="58"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> make good Wine. Here is said also to be good Meat, Corn, and other Necessaries. In this Port they load Wine, Money, and o∣ther Goods for <HI>Coquimbo.</HI> We would very willingly have gone ashoar here to have got some Refreshment, but could not for want of Boats. The Land continues to be very high and mountainous, so that I think it is the highest Land I ever saw. We kept still cruizing down along shore.</P>
<P>The 19th Instant, our Men being all at Dinner, and our Ship about ten Leagues off Shore, going with a fine fresh Gale of Wind at East, we were suddenly surprized with the change of the Colour of the Water, which looked as red as Blood to as great a distance as we could see, which might be about seven or eight Leagues. At first we were mightily surprized; but recollecting our selves, we sounded, but had no Ground at one hundred and seven∣ty Fathom. We then drew some Water up in Buckets, and poured some into a Glass. It still continued to look very red, till about a quarter of an Hour after it had been in the Glass; when all the red Sub∣stance floated at top, and the Water un∣derneath was as clear as usual. The red which floated at top, was of a slimy Sub∣stance, with little Knobs; and we all con∣cluded it could be nothing but the Spawn
<PB N="29" REF="59"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> of Fish. VVe were now in the Latitude of 16 d. 11 m. South, and had Variation 00 d. 48 m. Easterly; having past by three noted Ports, <HI>viz. Arica, Ylo,</HI> and <HI>Atti∣quipa.</HI></P>
<P>The Port of <HI>Arica</HI> is in the Latitude of 18 d. 20 m. S. Longitude from <HI>London</HI> by my Account <HI>W.</HI> 72 d. 20 m. and just off it we found 1 d. 27 m. Easterly Variation: This Port of <HI>Arica</HI> is a very good Port, and it is the Embarcado to most of the Mine-Towns of <HI>Peru:</HI> It is a place of vast Trade and extraordinarily well-peopled. It is said to be seldom without Shipping, altho' we saw none there at our passing by. On the South side of the Harbour is a pretty Town, situated on each side of a River, called after the name of the Town of <HI>Arica;</HI> and near the Town is a great Mountain, called the Mountain of <HI>Arica,</HI> under which the Shipping commonly lie in eight fathom Water; And at the other end of the Bay is another Mountain, cal∣led the Mountain of <HI>Sama,</HI> under which Mountain are four whitish Cliffs; And be∣tween the two Mounts of <HI>Sama</HI> and <HI>A∣rica,</HI> are three Rivers: The Northermost is called the River of <HI>Sama,</HI> the middle∣most the River of <HI>John Deus;</HI> And, as I said before, the other, the River of <HI>Arica;</HI> on the Banks of which the said Town is situated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XIII</NOTE> As we past by, I took a Draught
<PB N="30" REF="60"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> of the Harbour. As for <HI>Ylo</HI> and <HI>Attiquipa</HI> I shall say little of them, till I come to speak of them in my Description of the Coast of <HI>Chili, Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>From the Latitude of 16 d. 11 m. S. where we met the red Water, we kept still standing away to the Northward: And on the 22d of <HI>March,</HI> found our selves just off <HI>Lima,</HI> the Capital City of the two great Empires of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili.</HI> Here we furled all our Sails to our Main-Sail, because we would not be seen by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and laid our Ship by, intend∣ing to watch all Ships going in or out. At five in the Morning we made Sail again, and before we were aware, had like to have been upon the Rocks of <HI>Ormigas.</HI> These Rocks are distant from the Island <HI>Calan</HI> (which is the Port for <HI>Lima</HI>) about eight Leagues; and they bear from each other S. S. E. and N. N. W. They are large Rocks, and in the middle of them are some Bays; about which is said to be abun∣dance of good Fish, so that the Fishermen come to these Rocks a fishing. Here They likewise make abundance of Sea-fish-Oil. Having narrowly escaped these Rocks, we stood away to the Northward, and soon descryed two Sail. We presently made a clear Ship, and gave chase, and soon came up with the stern-most; she proved to be the Ship we fought with off the Island <HI>Juan</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="61"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> <HI>Fernando's,</HI> and was now just off the Port of <HI>Lima,</HI> into which she was bound to trade: We were very eager to stop her going in; for if we could, it would hin∣der the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from having Intelligence of us. Besides, we did not question the ta∣king of her, because now our Men were all in Health, whereas when we fought her before, we had between twenty and thirty Men very sick and weak; but being wil∣ling to show themselves, they had done what good they could. We knew also, if we took her, that she must needs prove a good Prize: And her Guns, Ammunition, and Provisions, would have been very welcome to us. So we concluded to en∣gage her our selves, and to send Captain <HI>Stradling</HI> after the other, which seemed not so big. But our Captain thought it not advisable to venture upon her: And whilst the Matter was disputing, the two Ships got into <HI>Lima;</HI> from whence I question whether twenty such Ships as ours could have forced them out.</P>
<P>Being therefore very much discontented, we again stood along shore to the North∣ward; and the next Day in the Morning, being <HI>March</HI> the 24th, we saw a Sail which we gave chase to, and came up with her, and took her without any resistance; She
<PB N="32" REF="62"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> proved to be a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship of about 150 Tuns, laden, as far as we could perceive, with Snuff, <HI>Flanders</HI>-Lace, VVoollen-Cloth wrought and unwrought, Silk, Pitch, Tar, Tobacco, Turtle-shell, Bees-wax, Soap, Cinamon, <HI>Jamaica</HI> Pepper, Jars of Balsom of <HI>Peru,</HI> a few Planks, and a pretty good Sum of Money. We kept her with us till <HI>March</HI> the 30th, and then having taken out a little of every thing, our Captain discharged her, alledging that, if we kept her, it would be a hindrance to his great∣er Designs. We were forced to be as well content as we could. So they stood for <HI>Lima</HI> whereunto they were bound; and we stood along shore to the Northward; and the next Morning by break of Day we found our selves just aboard of a strange Ship, which we soon took, not firing above 3 Guns: She was a new Ship of about two hundred Tuns, and sailed very well, con∣sidering her built; She was laden with several very good Commodities, as Indico, Cochineel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We were now just off the Port of <HI>Paita,</HI> whose Latitude is 5 d: 15 m. South; its Longitude from <HI>London</HI> I reckon to be VVest 85 d. 37 m. and we found Variation by a good Amplitude just off the Harbour, 2 d. 47 m. VVesterly. A further Description of the Coasts. I took a Draught, as we lay off the Harbour;
<PB N="33" REF="63"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> but not seeing any Ships, we did not go in, but still coasted away to the Northward. On the 4th of <HI>April</HI> this second Prize, af∣ter we had taken out a few odd Things, was, contrary to most of our Minds, dismist; the Captain alledging, that he would not cumber up his Ship, for that he intended to make a Voyage at one stroke upon some rich Town, on which he had a speedy Design.</P>
<P>On the fifth of <HI>April</HI> we began to pre∣pare for our intended Action, our Carpen∣ters fixing our two Launches or <HI>Spanish</HI> Long-Boats with two Patereroes to each Launch. On the 11th, being just in sight of the I∣sland <HI>Gallo</HI> (which at a distance looks like three Islands,) we saw a Sail, came up with her, and soon took her: She was a Bark of about fifty Tuns, laden with Plank; and had a considerable quantity of Turtle-shell on board. At first sight of us, their Men had all took to their Boat, and got ashore. This Bark our Captain intended to keep for the design in Hand; and the next Day, being <HI>April</HI> the 12th, we anchored at the Island <HI>Gal∣lo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig XIV</NOTE> whose Latitude is 2 d. 45 m. North∣ward: Longitude from <HI>London</HI> W. 76 d. 38 m. and we found Variation 4 d. West∣erly.</P>
<P>It is distant from the Main about five Leagues. It is in length about two
<PB N="34" REF="64"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Leagues, in breadth one. This is a very noted Island: When you are to the South∣ward of it, it appears in three Hummocks, which at a distance look like three Islands; and the Land between each Hummock, is very low. But when you are to the N. W. of it, at the South end you will see a small Island, or rather Rock, which looks very much like a Ship under sail; And when you are at the North end, you will so open the Land, as that you will see part of it does not join to the Island, as it seems to do when you are to the VVestward of it. At the N. E. end of this Island are three small Islands, or rather Rocks; the one of which is pretty high, and at a distance looks like a Barn; and the other two look like two Sail of Ships. At this Island you may see the main Land, which is very low near the VVater-side, but prodigious high up into the Country. Here we an∣chored in thirty five Fathom Water two Cables length from the shore, hard Sand. We anchored in the N. W. part of the I∣sland; the Northermost Point bearing N. half W. Southermost Point S. W. The Watering∣place goes in with a small Gap; over which upon the Hill is a plain Spot of red Earth, bearing N. W. half N. Though there are also several other good VVatering-places upon this Island. And in the N. E. part at <HI>Segnetta</HI> is the best anchoring. Here
<PB N="35" REF="65"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> you may wood and water very secure from any Enemy; and if occasion be, you may hale your Ship ashore and clean her. For it is very good Sandy. Ground, and the Water at Spring-tides rises and falls fourteen or fifteen foot. The Island is ve∣ry woody, affording large Timber, which is often sent in shipping up to the Coast of <HI>Peru.</HI> Here are some few wild Monkies, with abundance of Lizards; and a large sort of Lizard called a Lion-Lizard.</P>
<P>They are about the bigness of a Man's Arm. I measured one, which from the Head to the end of the Tail, was three foot eleven Inches. He has a large sort of a Comb upon his Head, which stands up like a Helmet or Head-piece to defend his Head. When he is assaulted or frightned, he sets his Comb up an end; but otherwise it lies down flat in a deep Dent in his Head, just fitted to it; so that when it is down, it can hardly be perceived. He has two very large Eyes; a large Mouth, with a great many fine small sharp Teeth. His Skin is very tough, of a sad Colour; full of black, yellow and blueish Spots: In all other things he resembles the com∣mon Lizard. When they are pursued, they will run very swift; yet our Dog used often to catch them. About six Leagues to the S. S. W. of this Island, is a small Island, or rather Rock, called <HI>Gorgo∣nilla;</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="66"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> and not far of, is the Island <HI>Tumaco.</HI> Hereabouts upon the Main are a great many Rivers, which make the Currents very uncertain about this Island.</P>
<P>On <HI>April</HI> the 17th, having lain here five Days, just as we were going to get up our Anchors, we saw a Sail stand∣in for the Island. So we lay still till she was pretty near in, and then we all three got under Sail, <HI>viz.</HI> our selves, the <HI>Cinque∣ports,</HI> and a small <HI>Spanish</HI> Bark whom we took six Days before. She stood boldly to us; and we soon, contrary to their ex∣pectation, made a Prize of them. They were going for the River <HI>Tumaco,</HI> to get some Provisions there; but as they past by, seeing us, and not hearing of an Enemy's being in the Seas, but thinking us to be <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they made towards us, being in hopes to get some Provisions of us for their Money; but on the contrary, they lost both themselves, their Vessel and Money. She was a small Vessel of about fifty Tuns, in her Balast; commanded by an half <HI>Indian.</HI> They had on Board a <HI>Guernsey</HI> Man, whose Name I have forgot. He was taken in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> ha∣ving strayed from his Companions, cut∣ting of Logwood. He was sent Prisoner to <HI>Mexico,</HI> where after he had been im∣prisoned for two Years, upon his turning Roman Catholick, he was at liberty ei∣ther
<PB N="37" REF="67"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> to stay in <HI>Mexico,</HI> or to go aboard any Ship belonging to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the South Seas: But they would not let him come any nearer the North Sea, for fear he should make his escape. So he being a Sea-faring Man, thought it most convenient to go on board some Ship, where we found him. He was very glad he was released from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> for had we not met with him, he must proba∣bly have continued there all Days of his Life.</P>

<P>FRom <HI>Gallo,</HI> we stood along to the North∣ward; our Captain letting us know, that his design was upon the Town of <HI>Santa</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="69"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> <HI>Maria;</HI> where we did not question but to get Gold enough, because it is the first place that they send all the Gold to, which they dig out of Mines not far from <HI>Santa Maria:</HI> The last Vessel we took, sailing very heavy; and knowing it would be a hinderance to our design; we sunk her. The Captain of her, after some fair Pro∣mises that we would give him a better, and that if we succeeded in our attempt on the Town of <HI>Santa Maria</HI> we would satis∣fie him otherwise to his Hearts Content, promised he would be our Pilot up to <HI>Santa Maria.</HI> So preparing for our in∣tended Enterprize, we sailed along shore to the Northward; and in our way, passed by Cape <HI>Corrientes,</HI> and several o∣ther noted places.</P>
<P>This Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> lies in the Latitude of 5 d. N. It is a very high Land; and when you are at Sea, it looks like an Island, by reason the Land near it at the Sea side is not so high. On the top of the Cape-land are three Hillocks. It is a very good Coast, and clear from Rocks and Shoals, and almost steep. From hence we proceeded on for Point <HI>Garachina.</HI> Since we left the Island of <HI>Gallo,</HI> we had fine fresh Gales of Wind, commonly at S. W. and S. S. W. On the 25th of <HI>April,</HI> (having past by several good Ports, as Port <HI>Santa Clara,</HI> Port <HI>Quemado,</HI> Port

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> <HI>Pinas,</HI> and several others; (of which I shall speak in my Description of the Coasts;) we anchored at Point <HI>Garachi∣na,</HI> in eighteen Fathom Water, claiey Ground, distant from the Point two Miles</P>
<P>I make this Point of <HI>Garachina</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XV.</NOTE> to lie in the Latitude of 7 d. 20 m. N. and distant from Port <HI>Pinas</HI> seven Leagues; and from the Island <HI>Gallera,</HI> six Leagues N. W. You may sail very well between the Island <HI>Gal∣lera</HI> and the Main; but have a great care of a shoal of Sand which lies midd-way, and on which many good Ships have been lost: But it is something dangerous to sail between the Island <HI>Gallera</HI> and the <HI>Kings Islands;</HI> for there are many Rocks, and if the Water should abate, you must of neces∣sity return to Point <HI>Garachina.</HI> Point <HI>Ga∣rachina</HI> makes the South Point of the Gulf of St <HI>Michael,</HI> as Cape St <HI>Laurenzo</HI> makes the North.</P>
<P>Into this Gulf we were bound. So ha∣ving laid here two Days, on the 27th one hundred and two of our Men with Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> and Captain <HI>Stradling</HI> in our Bark with three <HI>Spanish</HI> Launches went from our Ships, which we left at Point <HI>Garachina</HI> with sixty Men to guard them, with posi∣tive Orders not to remove from the place where we left them till our return; and we proceeded on our intended Expedition for <HI>Santa Maria.</HI> At eight at Night we an∣chored

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> amongst the Islands at the Rivers Mouth, by reason the Tide of Ebb made strongly out, so that we could not go against it. Here we lay all Night, having dark rainy Weather, with much Thunder and Lightning; so that we were all very wet, and had a most uncomfortable Night; for we were forced to lie in all the Rain, ha∣ving no shelter either in our little Bark or Boats. By Day-light the next Morning, as we lay at anchor, the Tide of Ebb not being done, a Canoa with five <HI>Indians</HI> came within call of us. They hal'd us and ask'd from whence we came: Our <HI>Indian</HI> Pilot, by the Captain's Directions, made answer, that we came from <HI>Panama.</HI> He bid them come on board, but they answer'd they would not: So our Captain ordered them to be fired at, which accord∣ingly was done. Whereupon they made what haste they could from us. One of our Lanches was sent after her, but in vain; for they soon got from us. This was of ill conse∣quence; for we were sure they would dis∣cover us to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Santa Maria;</HI> who, we knew, if they heard of an Ene∣my so near them, would not only lay Am∣buscades to annoy us going up the River, but (which was worst of all) would carry all that was valuable out of the Town. So two of our Lanches were immediately sent away with twenty two Hands each (Captain <HI>Strad∣ling</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="73"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> commanding them) with the <HI>Indian</HI> Pilot, to take the Town of <HI>Schuchadero:</HI> And Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> and we in the Bark were to follow as soon as the Tide served. Just as our two Lanches entered the River of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> they saw a Canoa with three <HI>Indians</HI> come out of the River <HI>Congo.</HI> Whereupon our Men put in behind a Point of Land in the River, just by the entrance; so that the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Ca∣noa not having seen them, were upon them before they suspected any thing; and our Men immediately step'd out and seiz'd them. It growing now towards Even, they took one of the Prisoners into the Lanch, and sent the other two in the Canoa, with five of our Men, to seek the Town of <HI>Schucha∣dero,</HI> which our Captain told them was on the North-side of the River, and about three Leagues within the Mouth. But it being dark, they could not find it. How∣ever they heard the barking of a great many Dogs on the other side the River; whence concluding there must be some Town, they immediately put over for the other side. As soon as they approached near the Town, the two <HI>Indians</HI> which were in the Canoa with our five Men for the Out-scout, jumped over-board, and we lost them. Immediately one of our Men in the Canoa, snatched up his Gun and fir'd at one of the <HI>Indians:</HI> Whether
<PB N="43" REF="74"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> he shot him or no, we cannot tell; but as soon as he had fired, there was another Gun fired from the Shoar. Upon which our Men fired a Volley, and landed, and went to the Town, which stood near the water-side, and took it without any resist∣ance; all the people being fled at our first Gun firing, knowing they were not strong enough to resist us: For no doubt they had Intelligence by the Canoa which escap'd us at the Rivers Mouth. In the Town our Men found abundance of Fowls, Maiz, Beans, Yams, Potatoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but little else. The next Morning, being <HI>April</HI> the 27th, Captain <HI>Stradling</HI> sent the Canoa to see for <HI>Ʋs</HI> in the Bark: For after they were gone to take the Town, as soon as the Tide of Flood began, we got under sail, intending to be soon after them. But mistaking the Rivers-mouth, we ran past it; and not finding any other way to go in, we came to an anchor, and so were forced to lie all Night, and the next Day till Noon, the time of the Sea-breeze; at which time we met a Canoa coming out, which at first we suspected to be Enemies, but found they were our own Men; who gave us an ac∣count of the taking of the <HI>Indian</HI> Town aforesaid, and that in the Canoa they took a Pacquet of Letters: The Letters were immediately opened; and in them was found as follows: <HI>From the President of</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="75"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Panama <HI>to the Governour of the Town of</HI> Santa Maria: That <HI>this was to let him know he had advice that two hundred and fif∣ty</HI> English <HI>from</HI> Jamaica <HI>had landed on the North-side of the</HI> Isthmus, <HI>and had a design upon the said Town of</HI> Santa Maria, <HI>and that it was seven Days since he had sent four hun∣dred Soldiers to reinforce them at</HI> Santa Ma∣ria, <HI>and that he did not question but by the time he received the Letters they would be with him:</HI> That <HI>he would have him always keep himself upon his Guard, till this Advice was either disproved or confirmed.</HI> By that time we had read this Pacquet, we were up as high as the Town that we took, which we called <HI>Schuchadero,</HI> there being another of the same Name on the North-side against it; and came to an anchor just in four fathom Water. The next Day in the Afternoon, which was <HI>April</HI> the 30th, Captain <HI>Dam∣pier</HI> and Captain <HI>Stradling,</HI> with three Launches and the Canoa with eighty seven of our Men, proceeded for <HI>Santa Maria:</HI> And our chief Mate and my self, with thirteen Hands, were left to guard the Bark, with Orders not to stir from the place where we lay, till our Mens return; which was soon afterwards: For about twelve this Night they returned on board, frustrated of their Design. Our Men gave us an account, that they were up within a quarter of a Mile of the Town; that they
<PB N="45" REF="76"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> were assaulted by three Ambuscades, in which one of our Men was killed, and se∣veral wounded; that our Men beat them from their Ambuscades, and would wil∣lingly have put ashoar; but Captain <HI>Dam∣pier</HI> advis'd, that since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> knew of our coming, and had had so much time as to provide Ambuscades for us, it could not be doubted but they had made the best use of their time, and had taken care to con∣vey their Wives and Children and all that was valuable, out of the Town; which is always the first thing they do when they hear of an Enemy: So it was resolved to return to us at <HI>Schuchadero.</HI> And on <HI>May</HI> the 1<HI>st,</HI> betimes in the Morning, we left <HI>Schuchadero,</HI> and went down the River in order to return on board our Ships, which we left at Anchor at Point <HI>Garachina.</HI></P>
<P>At our return on board, <HI>May</HI> the 6<HI>th,</HI> we were so scant of Provisions, that there were five green Plantains order'd to be boiled for every six Men: But to our great comfort, when we were almost at our Wits-end, we descried a Sail at 12 this Night, who came to an Anchor close by us. We soon got up our Anchor, and took her without any resistance. This was a great Ship, of about 550 Tuns. She was deep∣ly laden with Flower, Sugar, Brandy, Wine, about 30 Tuns of Marmalet of Quinces, a considerable quantity of Salt,
<PB N="46" REF="77"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> with some Tuns of Linnen and Woollen-Cloth; so that now we might supply our selves with Provisions for four or five Years. I was put on board this Prize in behalf of Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> and our Ship's Company; and the Master of the <HI>Cinque∣ports</HI> was put on board, as Chief for Cap∣tain <HI>Stradling</HI> and their Ship's Company. Then we sunk our Bark which had carried us up to <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> and with our two Ships and great Prize stood a-cross the Bay of <HI>Panama</HI> to the Westward, amongst the <HI>Kings</HI> or <HI>Pearl Islands. May</HI> the 12th, we saw the <HI>Kings Island,</HI> bearing N. dist. 4 Leagues. The 13th we anchor'd in the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> the Island <HI>Tabago</HI> bearing N. dist. 4 Leagues; the <HI>Kings Island</HI> E. S. E. dist. 8 Leagues. The 14th we weighed and ran nearer to the Island <HI>Tabago;</HI> and brought it to bear N. by E. dist. three Leagues. Here we anchor'd on purpose to romage our Prize. The 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th, vve continued taking Provisions out of her, as Wine, Brandy, Sugar, Flower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And on the 18th a small Bark of about 30 Tuns coming in sight, vve sent our Long-boat and Canoa and took her. She had little in her, only a small quantity of Money. This Bark Cap∣tain <HI>Stradling</HI> kept for his ovvn use.</P>
<P>Here our Captain and Captain <HI>Strad∣ling</HI> having some disagreement, conclu∣ded
<PB N="47" REF="78"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> to part Company; which accord∣ingly they did; and the Men of each Ship had their liberty to go in vvhich Ship they thought convenient. So five of our Men vvent to Captain <HI>Stradling,</HI> and five of his came to us. We vvere told by the Priso∣ners, that there vvere 80000 Dollars on board our Prize; that they vvere taken in by stealth at <HI>Lima,</HI> and lay at the bottom in the Run of the Ship. Our Captain did not believe this; and vvas unvvilling to tarry longer, that vve might have romaged her to the bottom; because he thought loss of time vvould spoil his greater De∣signs. Having therefore taken out a quantity of Provisions, she vvas dismiss'd; And vve, on the 19th of <HI>May,</HI> parted from the <HI>Cinque-ports,</HI> intending to beat up up∣on the Coast of <HI>Peru</HI> again; and this day passed by the Island <HI>Iguanos.</HI></P>
<P>This Island is not very high. It is very vvoody, and has a very good anchoring∣place over-against the main Land in 18 Fathom Water. Here is also very good fresh Water; and if occasion be, you may haul your Ship ashoar and clean: For the Water rises and falls ten or eleven Foot; And on the Land-side is good sandy Ground: This will defend you from the S. E.; for these Winds often blow very hard. The Marks of this Island are, that to the S. W. is <HI>Punta-mala</HI> or bad Point. You must not
<PB N="48" REF="79"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> come near it; for it hath a great many Rocks and Shoals which come near a League into the Sea. From this <HI>Punta∣mala</HI> we stood away to the Southward for the Coast of <HI>Peru:</HI> And on the twenty ninth of <HI>May</HI> we saw Land, which proved to be the Island of <HI>Gallo.</HI> From <HI>Punta-mala,</HI> and during our stay in the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> we had for the most part dirty squally weather, with much Thunder and Lightning, and very uncer∣tain Gales, but mostly between the South and the West. We stood off and on for five Days, endeavouring to weather the I∣sland <HI>Gallo;</HI> but here being a strong Cur∣rent setting to the Northward, we found it difficult to do: Yet after much turning, on the 4th of <HI>June</HI> we weather'd it, and proceeded along the Shore for the Coast of <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>June</HI> the 7th we saw a Sail, gave chase, came up with her and took her: she was about 100 Tuns, came from <HI>Truxillo,</HI> and was bound for <HI>Panama;</HI> laden with Flower, Sugar, Brandy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with some Bales of wrought Silk in her. We took a Packet, which we open'd; The first Let∣ter vve happen'd to read, vvas from the Captain of the <HI>French</HI> Ship vve fought off the Island <HI>Juan Fernando's,</HI> and met with a∣gain off the Port of <HI>Lima;</HI> It vvas directed to the President of <HI>Panama,</HI> and gave an
<PB N="49" REF="80"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> account, That <HI>he fought two English Priva∣teers off the Island</HI> J. Fernandoes; That <HI>the smallest of the two fired but eight or ten Guns at him, and then fell a-stern, and did not come up again during the Fight; as he be∣lieved, for want of Wind;</HI> That <HI>the great Ship</HI> (meaning us) <HI>fought him Broad-side ond Broad-side for more than six Hours;</HI> That <HI>we kill'd them a great many Men; and that at his coming to</HI> Lima, <HI>he sent ashore thirty two of his Men, each of which had either lost a Leg or an Arm or an Eye:</HI> and <HI>That it was a great chance we had not taken him; for that at our parting they had given themselves over as lost, not having Men to defend them∣selves.</HI> We also had account by other Letters, That the two <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> which we saw off the Island <HI>Juan Fernando's,</HI> had met with a Boat at Sea, in which there was an <HI>Englishman</HI> and a Dog: This was the Boat which belonged to Captain <HI>Stradling,</HI> and which broke loose from him as we chas'd the <HI>French</HI> Ship off <HI>Juan Fernando's:</HI> That the said two <HI>French</HI> Ships had been in at <HI>Juan Fernando's,</HI> and had taken up our Anchors, Cables, Long-boat, with all Captain <HI>Stradling</HI>'s Stores, and his five Men, and our Negro which was left there. We also had advice that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had fitted out two Men of War against us; the one of 32 brass Guns, 24 Pounders each; the other of 36 Guns, of the some big∣ness;
<PB N="50" REF="81"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> That each of them had 350 Sea∣men, and 150 Soldiers, choice Men; and they lay cruising for us in the Bay of <HI>Guia∣quil,</HI> between Point <HI>St Hellena</HI> and <HI>Cape Blanco.</HI> From the 7th to the 12th, we were forced to go away with an easie Sail, because of our Prize, who sail'd very hea∣vy. And seeing it was likely to be a great hindrance to us in beating to Windward, we concluded to go into some place to ro∣mage her. Accordingly on the 12th we went into <HI>Sardinas</HI> Bay, and anchor'd with our Prize in ten fathom Water, about four Miles off Shore. We durst not venture a∣ny further in, by reason of so many Shoals and Banks of Sand which lie off it. The Sea-Coast here, is inhabited by <HI>Indians,</HI> but they are not very numerous. Here are several small Rivers, which run with fresh Water down to the Sea-side. And from this place, by the Sea-side, all along to the Southward, till you come to the Bay of <HI>Tacames,</HI> are white Cliffs, and many Shoals, as far as to Point <HI>Gallera.</HI></P>
<P>From this Bay of <HI>Sardinas,</HI> six Leagues to the Southward, is the great River of <HI>St Jago;</HI> the Mouth of which is said to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a Mile over; but in it is no good an∣choring, until you are got well within the Mouth; and if you must needs go into the River, keep near the Land on the South side. This River is seldom made use of by Shipping; it lying out of the way;
<PB N="51" REF="82"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> only in case of necessity, or by chance, they put in for refreshment; for here is plenty of all sorts of Provisions. It hath on the Sea-side 14 or 15 pieces of broken Ground, of a whitish colour; and at the North-end of them is the Bay of <HI>Sardinas,</HI> wherein we careen'd our Ship, and roma∣ged our Prize, and water'd at one of the fresh-water Rivers; the Water of which was white like Milk, and both smelt and tasted very strong of Musk, occasioned by the many Alligators swimming in the River.</P>
<P>We shot several of them, one of which measured thirty Feet in length, and was bigger about than a large Bullock. He is very full of great Scales, from the Neck to the end of his Tail. He has a very large sharp set of Teeth, with very long Claws on his Feet. It is an amphibious Creature, living on Land as well as in the Water. When they are lying on shore, they look like a great fallen down Tree; and for such, One would take them at a distance. They will run very fast on the Land; and are of such strength, that they will take a Horse or Cow and carry it down to the Water, and there devour it. They will seize on any thing as well on Land as in the Water; and commonly make great havock amongst Cattle, if there be any near the place where they Harbour, which is commonly in fresh Water Rivers.
<PB N="52" REF="83" MS="y"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> The <HI>Indians</HI> are not greatly afraid of them, neither in the Water nor on Land. If they are pursued by them on Land, they run in a Circle; and this great Creature is not able to turn his unweildy Body so quick, but that they easily get from him. The <HI>Indians</HI> likewise go into the Water to seek them, with a piece of Iron like a Har∣poon at both ends, and two pieces of Iron a-cross: This they hold by the middle in their Hand; and the Alligators, when they bite, raise their Head out of the Wa∣ter:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Then the <HI>Indians</HI> hold out this piece of Iron to them, at which they bite, and it fastens in their Mouth and keeps it open like a Gag. These Creatures lay Eggs about a hundred at a time; Their Eggs are about the bigness of a Goose's, but the Shell is almost as thick as an Ostridge's. I have seen many of them. They are quite round; although Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> in Vol. II. Part. II. <HI>page</HI> 75, says, that these Eggs are longer than a Goose's; which I suppose he took only upon Hear-fay. The Flesh of the Alligators is not fit to be eaten, it being very strong and musky; nay the very Water of the Rivers which they were in, tasted so strong of them, that is, of Musk, that a Draught of it would almost suffocate us. By the Rivers side here were about fourteen or fifteen <HI>Indian</HI> Fishermen's Houses, who, as I sup∣pose,
<PB N="53" REF="84"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> were fled for fear of us: For we could not see any of them, all the time of our stay here.</P>
<P>On the 19th, having done all our busi∣ness here, and dismist our Prize, after ha∣ving taken a few odd things out; we de∣parted from this place, and stood to the Southward for the Coast of <HI>Peru;</HI> and the Prize stood to the Northward for <HI>Panama,</HI> being the place whereto she was bound. The 21st we saw a Sail, being then off Cape St <HI>Francisco;</HI> but in the Night, lost her again. This Cape St <HI>Francisco,</HI> is a high Cape; but far higher within Land, than it is near the Water-side. When you are North or South from it, it seems like three Capes. It is a woody moun∣tainous Land, and has white Cliffs. It lies in the Latitude of 1 d. N. Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West 81 d. 50 m. and we found the Variation to be 3 deg. 57 min. Westerly. On the 25th, we saw the Sail, we had seen the other Day; we soon came up with her, and took her. She was a small Bark, of about forty five Tuns, came from <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> and was bound for <HI>Guiaquill,</HI> laden with Pitch, Tar and Cordage; And after we had taken out a small quantity of each, she was dismissed. On the 8th of <HI>July,</HI> we saw the Island of <HI>Plata,</HI> bearing E. S. F. distance five Leagues. This Island lies in the Latitude of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.
<PB N="54" REF="85"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> 14 m. S. and from Cape St <HI>Laurenzo</HI> S. E. It is a pretty high Island, but highest at the North end. At some time of the Year here is said to be plenty of very good Turtle; and on it are some small Trees or rather Bushes, not fit for any use. It is all round steep Rocks, unless near the an∣choring place, which is on the East-side; And at both the North and South Points there are small steep Rocks and Shoals, which stretch out into the Sea for a Mile or two. Upon this Island is said to be no fresh Water.</P>
<P>From hence we stood to the Southward, and on the 11th fell in with Point <HI>Saint Hellena.</HI> This Point is distant from the Island of <HI>Plata</HI> eighteen Leagues. It is high Land, and at a distance looks like an Island, because the Land to the Northward is lower than it. This Point is the North Point of the Bay of <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> as Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> is the South Point. In this Bay is the great Town or City of <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> which is said to consist of nine hundred and fifty <HI>Spanish</HI> Houses, besides <HI>Indians;</HI> and to have five Parish Churches, besides private Chapels. It has a Governour, who is next to the President of <HI>Panama,</HI> although under none but the Vice-roy of <HI>Peru.</HI> It is said to be pretty well fortifi∣ed, to hinder the approach of an Enemy; having two Forts, the one standing at
<PB N="55" REF="86"/>
<MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="year"/> the South end of the Town, and the other upon a Hill.</P>
<P>On the 21st we saw a Sail, and stood towards her; and next day, being <HI>July</HI> the 22d, came up with her. She proved to be one of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Men of War which was fitted out on purpose to take us. This was the Ship of thirty two Guns. We being pretty near each other, they gave us a broad-side, but we did not mind them; all our care was to get the Wea∣ther-gage. In order to which, while we carried too much Sail, and the Wind blew very fresh, our fore-top Mast unfortunate∣ly came by the board. Immediately we got our Hatchets and cut all clear way, and our Captain ordered the Helm to be clapt a Weather and bore away. The Enemy seeing this, immediately bore away after us with all the Sail they could, ho∣ping to come up and take us; for now they doubted not but they should take us. We observing that our running had increa∣sed their Courage, resolved thereupon to lie by, and fight it out. Captain <HI>Dampier</HI>'s Opinion was, that we could sail better upon one Mast than the Enemy; and therefore that it was best to put before the Wind. But however we being em∣bayed, chose rather to fight, than to be chased ashoar. So hoisting the bloody Flag at our Main-top-mast Head, with a
<PB N="56" REF="87"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> resolution neither to give nor take Quarter, we began the fight, and went to it as fast as we could load and fire. The Enemy kept to windward at a good distance from us, so that we could not come to make use of our small Arms; But we divided the two Watches, and one was to manage the great Guns, whilst the other looked on; and when those at the great Guns were weary, the other were to take their places, till they had refresh'd themselves. Thus we fired, I believe, five Guns to his one. We fired about 560, and he about 110 or 115; and we fought him from twelve at Noon to half an hour past six at Night, although at a good distance; for he kept so far to windward of us, that our shot sometimes would hardly reach him, tho' his would at the same time fly over us. At half an hour past six, it growing duskish, they left off firing, and we did the same. We had by good Providence none of our Men either kill'd or wounded by the Ene∣my; only two thro' carelesness had their Hands and Faces blasted; but in a small time they both recovered. After our fight was over, we got a spare Main-top-mast which we had between Decks; and our Carpenters went to work to fix it; it be∣ing of it self too big for a Fore top-Mast. VVe lay by all the Night, and in the Morning betimes looked out for our Ene∣my

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> expecting to have the other Battle with him; but contrary to our expectati∣ons, he had made Sail from us in the Night. Our Captain upon this, resolved to quit the Coast of <HI>Peru,</HI> and told us he design'd to go into the Bay of <HI>Tacames,</HI> where he did not doubt but we should get Provision enough; for now we had little besides Flower. We were pretty well contented, and stood away for the said Bay; and on the 28th of <HI>July</HI> we passed by the Point of <HI>Gallera.</HI></P>
<P>This Point is low towards the Sea-side, and plain even Ground on the top. You must steer N. E. keeping off from it about a Mile to Leeward, by reason of a Shoal which lies off it, which Shoal is full of Rocks and Stones, and lies all hid under Water. And in the Point is a Bay of Sand, which you may see when you come in with your Ship within the Point; and coming over the said Bay, you will see a little Lake of fresh Water running into the Sea; and when the Tide is at the highest, the Salt Water runs into it. Wherefore if you would take in fresh Water here, you must take care to go to the right of the said Spring, and you will come to the Head of it, where you will find excellent good Water in a Pond, near unto a pleasant Grove of Trees, about a Musket-shot with∣in Land. But you must be sure to go well
<PB N="58" REF="89"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> armed, when you fetch it. For there commonly come down <HI>Indians,</HI> who are always at War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and will rob and kill any white Men, thinking all white Men to be <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Here is said to be abundance of Ostridges and wild Asses.</P>
<P>We passed by this Point of <HI>Gallera,</HI> and the same Day anchored in the Bay of <HI>Ta∣cames;</HI> which was the place whereto we were bound, and is distant from the Point of <HI>Gallera</HI> between two and three Leagues. We anchored at this <HI>Tacames</HI> in six fathom Water, Point <HI>Gallera</HI> bearing VV. S. VV. distant between two and three Leagues. At our coming in, we sent our Boat ashore with twenty Men armed, hoping to get some Provisions; but the Inhabitants ha∣ving notice of an Enemy's being in those Seas, as soon as they saw us, drove the Cattle from the VVater-side up into the Country, and they themselves retired to the Mountains with their VVives and Chil∣dren and all they had. So our Men went into the Village, which consisted of about fifty <HI>Indian</HI> Houses, deserted by the Inha∣bitants. Here in the River we found a Bark upon the Stocks a building, of about fifty Tuns; with new Plank enough by her, to build another. And we took a∣nother small Bark of about ten Tuns, la∣den with Plantains. This Bark we intend∣ed
<PB N="59" REF="90"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> to keep instead of a Long-boat; she had two Masts and two square Sails, and we named her the <HI>Dragon.</HI></P>
<P>The Road on the Coast of <HI>Tacames,</HI> is lower Land than the Bay of St <HI>Matthew;</HI> it is indifferent clear Ground, but not very deep, where you may anchor near the Mount. And if you do not like to anchor near the Mount, you may anchor where you will by the Main Land on the VVea∣ther-side; and there is VVater enough, and no danger. And if you send your Boat ashoar, you may supply your self with both VVood and VVater. In the River are pleasant Groves of Trees; and it has in the entry of it a little Rock. The Land-marks of the River are, that the Land on the Lee-side is high, and you may see a white spot on it, like a white Sheet.</P>
<P>To the Northward eight Leagues, is the Bay of St <HI>Matthew.</HI> In this Bay is a large River, the breadth of which is three quar∣ters of a Mile; but till you get within the Mouth, you will find no good Anchor-Ground. If you would go into it, keep near the Land on the VVeather or South side: This River is seldom used by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but only for Refreshment; for there is plenty of all sorts of Provisions; and if their Ships be out of Repair, they can here have them repaired. Two Leagues
<PB N="60" REF="91"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> up the River are <HI>Indian</HI> People, who sell to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when they come here, all sorts of Fruits, as Coco-nuts, Plantains, Bonanoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Coco-nut-Trees are from 50 to 60, 70, 80 and 100 Foot in height, mostly slender and streight. They have Leaves, some four fathom, and four fathom and a half long, and produce a Nut call'd a Co∣co-nut; which, with the outer Rind on, is bigger than any Man's Head. The outer Rind being taken off, there appears a Shell, some of which will hold near a Quart. Within the Shell is the Nut; and within the Nut is about a Pint and a half of pure clear VVater, which is very cool, brisk, pleasant and sweet. The Kernel of the Nut is also very good; which if it be pret∣ty old, we scrape all to pieces; the scra∣pings we set to soak in about a quart of fresh VVater for three or four hours, and then strain the VVater; which when strain'd hath both the colour and taste of Milk: And if it stand a while, it will have a thick scum on it, not unlike Cream. This Milk being boiled with Rice, is ac∣counted by our Doctors to be very nou∣rishing; for which reason we often give o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it to our sick Men. The Leaves of the Tree, serve to thatch Houses; the outer Rind of the Nut, to make Linnen-Cloth: of it they also make Ropes for Ships, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="61" REF="92"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Rigging, Cables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are a good Commodity in most places of the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> The Shell of the Nut will make very pretty Drinking-cups: It will also burn very well, and make a very fierce and hot Fire The Kernel serves instead of Meat, and the Water therein contained instead of Drink: And if the Nut be very old, the Kernel will of it self turn to Oyl, which is often made use of to fry with, but most commonly to burn in Lamps. So that from this Tree, as I may say, they have Meat, Drink, Clo∣thing, Houses, Firing and Rigging for their Ships. These Trees may be known by any Ships passing by; for they are void of Leaves, except just at the top. At the bottom of the Leaves the Coco-nuts grow, 10, 15 or 20 in a cluster; and they hang by a small string, which is full of joynts.</P>
<P>The Plantain-tree, is about 13 or 14 foot in heighth, and about four foot round: The Leaves of the Tree are about eight or nine foot long, and two foot broad, and end in a round Point. The Fruit grows at the bottom of the Leaf, upon a great Stalk, in a Cod of about eight Inches long, and the bigness of a Black-pudding. The Cod is of a fine yellow colour, often speckled with red. The Cod being taken off, the inside of it is white; but the Plantain it
<PB N="62" REF="93"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> self is yellow like Butter, and as soft as a ripe Pear. There will grow 50 or 60 some∣times, upon a Stalk; and five or six Stalks upon a Tree. They are an extraordinary good Fruit; and in most parts of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies</HI> there is great plenty of them.</P>
<P>The Bonanoe-Tree<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XVII.</NOTE> is much the same; only the Fruit is not so long as the Plan∣tain, being, as I said before, about eight Inches long, and the Bonanoe not above six. It grows in the same manner as the Plantain; 50 or 60 in a cluster, upon one Stalk. The Fruit is very mellow, and ex∣traordinary sweet and good.</P>
<P>The Land-marks of this River in the Bay of <HI>St Matthew</HI> are, that the Bay is higher Land than that which is behind it towards the inward parts, to the Cape of <HI>St Fran∣cisco,</HI> or thereabouts. It hath on the Sea-Coast 14 or 15 pieces of broken Ground, which are white; and in the middle of them is the said Bay of <HI>St Matthew.</HI></P>
<P>On the 31<HI>st</HI> of <HI>July</HI> we left the Bay of <HI>Tacames,</HI> and carried our little Prize, na∣med the <HI>Dragon,</HI> with us; not designing to touch at any place, till we come to the Gulf of <HI>Nicoya.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM the Bay of <HI>Tacames</HI> in the La∣titude of about 1 d. 20 m. North, we stood away to the N. W. a-cross the Bay of <HI>Panama;</HI> and on the 30th of <HI>Au∣gust</HI> we fell in with an Island, which pro∣ved to be the Island <HI>Caneo.</HI> It is an indif∣ferent high Island, and lies in the Latitude of 10d. N. It is not above a League round. and the anchoring-place is on the N. E, side, in 14 fadom Water, not above a quar∣ter of a Mile from the Shore. Here is said by our <HI>Indian</HI> Pilots to be extraordinary good Wood, VVater, Turtle, and store of wild Hogs. Near this Island are two I∣slands more; and between them are seve∣ral Shoals; and not far off, upon the main Land, is <HI>Punta-mala</HI> or bad Point; and within <HI>Punta-mala</HI> is a fine deep Bay, in which Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendish</HI> formerly clean'd his Ship.</P>
<P>From hence we coasted away to the VVestward, and past by the <HI>Sierras de los Coronadas,</HI> or the Crowned Mountains. These Mountains are very remarkable, there being none like them on this Coast. From
<PB N="65" REF="96"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> the Crowned Mountains we still coasted a∣way to the VVestward, and passed by the four Rocks, called by the <HI>Spaniards, Fa∣rallones de Queipo.</HI> These Rocks lie just at the VVest-end of the Crowned Moun∣tains; and the Coast runs N. N. VV. and S. S. E. Near these Rocks is the River <HI>E∣strella,</HI> or the Star River. This River is in the bottom of a large Bay, and here is commonly a great Sea. From this Bay to <HI>Herradura</HI> is 11 Leagues. <HI>Herradura</HI> is the South Point that makes the Gulf of <HI>Ni∣coya,</HI> as <HI>Cape Blanco</HI> is the North. VVe arrived at <HI>Herradura</HI> on the 16 of <HI>August;</HI> but past by it, and went further into the Gulf, till we came to many small Islands, called by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> the <HI>Middle Islands</HI> because they lie in the middle of the Gulf. VVe anchor'd between <HI>Them</HI> and the Bay of <HI>Caldera;</HI> bringing the Bay of <HI>Caldera</HI> to bear East, and the said <HI>Middle Islands</HI> to bear VVest. Here we lay all this day; but sent our little Prize the <HI>Dragon</HI> to view the Gulf, and to find out a convenient place to lay our Ship ashore in. And the next Mor∣ning being <HI>August</HI> the 17th, our Captain and Carpenter went in the Canoa amongst the <HI>Middle Islands,</HI> to see if there was any convenience amongst <HI>Them</HI> for laying our Ship a-ground. In the Evening our Cap∣tain and Carpenter returned in the Canoa, and brought on board two Turtles, which

<PB N="66" REF="99"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> they caught as they were going ashore. We presently went to work in cutting up the Turtle, boiling, roasting, frying, ba∣king, and stewing, according as each one thought fit. Our Captain and Car∣penter had, as they said, found out a con∣venient place to lay our Ship ashore, amongst these middle Islands. So we intended to lie here this Night, and, if it was fair, to go in on the morrow.</P>
<P>The same Evening our little Prize re∣turned to us again. They had been up the River <HI>Changel,</HI> and found two or three <HI>Indian</HI> Houses, and some Plantain-Walks: The <HI>Indians</HI> climbed the Trees, and cut down for them as many Plantains as they would have. They found also two Ca∣noas haul'd up upon the Sand, and brought them both off. In their way they caught eight Turtles, and eat nothing of their own Provisions, but fed upon Turtle du∣ring the Time they were from us; They gave us an account that they had found out a very good and secure place at the Island St <HI>Lucas,</HI> for us to lay our Ship a¦shore in; That it was in a fine deep Bay▪ which at the entrance was not above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pistol-shot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over: That with five or six Guns upon each Point at the Entrance, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might so fortifie our selves, as that no Enemy durst approach us; for that ten o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us might desend our selves against fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="67" REF="100"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> hundred. However we found the <HI>Middle Islands</HI> to be as convenient as any place could be: And our Captain seeming to like this place as well, and knowing we could fortifie our selves as strongly here and with as little trouble; we chose this place: Accordingly on the 18th, it being fair Weather and calm, we towed our Ship in amongst the Islands, and lay with∣in Stones cast of the Shore all round, with one Anchor a Head, and a Cable out at our Stern, which was made fast to a great Tree on the Shore. As soon as we had fastened our Ship, all Hands went ashore and began to build Tents for our Cooper and Sail-maker to work in, and to put our Goods and Provisions in. In the mean time our chief Mate was sent in the little <HI>Dragon</HI> with twenty Men armed, and two Pattereroes, to cruize in the Gulf; where after he had cruized five or six Days, he returned with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Bark of about forty Tuns: She had in her some few Jars of Brandy, Wine, and some Sugar. They were going to repair her, she being very old; and for that purpose had five or six Carpenters and Caukers on board, who came very opportunely to help us to re∣pair our Ship, for we had great need of Workmen. We took out our Powder, Shot and all our Ammunition; with all our Bread, some of our Flower, and our
<PB N="68" REF="101"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> two Quarter-deck Guns; and put them on board this last Bark. Then we got all the rest of our things ashore, and made every thing ready for cleaning our Ship. Our Men went ashore often with the Sain, and caught store of Fish, especially if they took the right time, which was at the Flood, and better in the Night than in the Day. The 22d of <HI>August,</HI> we sent our Canoas to an Island just by us, upon which there were several old fallen-down Houses; the Thatch of which we brought away to make use of in burning the bottom of our Ship. The bottom of our Ship was in many places eaten like a Honey-Comb; insomuch that the firm Plank was no thick∣er than an old Six-pence: Nay, in some places in the Hold, we could thrust our Thumbs quite through with ease. Our Ship being in this condition, and we in want of Planks to new bottom her; our Carpenter was forced to make a hard shift, and stop the Leaks as well as he could with Nails and Oakam.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the 2d. Our Captain and Mr <HI>Clippinton</HI> the chief Mate falling out; Mr <HI>Clippinton,</HI> with twenty one of our Men, seized upon the Bark, in which was all our Ammunition, and a great part of our Provisions; and got up her anchor, and went without the Islands. From thence he sent us word, that if any of us had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 
<PB N="69" REF="102"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> mind to go with him, we should be wel∣come; but however, that we might not be quite destitute, he would restore us all our Powder, Shot and Ammunition; re∣serving only two or three Barrels for his own use. And according to his promise he put on shore our Powder, Shot, and o∣ther Ammunition in an <HI>Indian</HI> House, to shelter it from the Rain, and sent us word of his so doing. And we went with our Canoas and fetcht it aboard.</P>
<P>And now our Captain's design being to take the <HI>Manila</HI>-Ship, we went to work in getting our things aboard, and watering and rigging our Ship. And on the 22d, we hal'd out from the <HI>Middle Islands,</HI> and anchored in the Gulf. Which before I proceed, I shall here give you some De∣scription of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXVII.</NOTE>In this Gulf are several Islands, as the Island of St <HI>Lucas,</HI> and the Island of <HI>Chira.</HI> To this latter Island the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships come to take in their lading, which is brought from <HI>Nicoya.</HI> This Island is inhabited, and lies in the Latitude of 10 d. 50 m. North; and on the N. E. part is another Island called the Island <HI>Guaiabas,</HI> near which is a Bar or Shoal. Observe, when you enter into this Gulf, that you leave all the Islands to the Westward, except the Island <HI>Guaiabas,</HI> which has the Bar near it; and steer close by the Island of <HI>Chira.</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="103"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> This Island is distant from from St <HI>Lucas</HI> eight Leagues; and they lie from each o∣ther North and South. To the S. S. W. of the Island St <HI>Lucas,</HI> distant about four Leagues, are the <HI>Middle Islands.</HI> They are a parcel of small Islands, and amongst them is a good Harbour, in which we wooded and watered and hal'd our Ship ashore.</P>
<P>We found here several sorts of very good Fish, as <HI>Mullets, Breams, Silver-fish,</HI> &amp;c. Of Shell-fish here is <HI>Conchs, Clams, Pearl-Oysters;</HI> and another sort of Oyster, called the <HI>Great-Oyster.</HI> Of Birds here is great store, <HI>viz. Maccaws</HI> and <HI>Pelicans</HI> and <HI>Carrion-Crows.</HI> And of amphibious Crea∣tures, the <HI>Guano</HI> and the <HI>Sea-Turtle.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Maccaw,</HI> is a very fine Bird, his Feathers being of most sorts of Colours. He is about the bigness of a Hawk; and in shape like a Parrot, only his Bill is perfectly white, and his Feet and Legs quite black.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carrion-Crow,</HI> is as big as a small Turkey, and in all respects very like one; for I never saw any difference neither in Colour nor Shape. The Flesh of them, both smells and tastes so strong of Musk, that there is no eating of it. These Crea∣tures commonly resort to any place where any dead Creature is, and feed upon it; for which reason they are called <HI>Carrion:</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="104"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> But the reason why they are called <HI>Crows,</HI> I know not; for they are nothing like them, but altogether like a wild Tur∣key.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pelican,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XVIII.</NOTE> is almost as big as a Swan. Its Colour is inclining to white, only the tips of his Wings are brown. It hath a long Bill of about twenty Inches, with a very large Crop joyning to the lower part of his Bill, and so descending by the Throat, like a Bag or Satchel, very obser∣vable, and of a largeness almost beyond credit, into which it receiveth Oysters, Cockles, Conchs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or any other Shell∣fish; which being not able to break, it retains them until they open, and then vo∣miting them up, picks out the Meat. As for their making a Hole in their Breast to give their Blood to their Young, I do not believe, nor ever saw any such thing, al∣though I have seen thousands both young and old together, and have eaten many of them. They are good Food; only they taste somewhat fishy. They have broad Feet like a Duck, being Water∣fowls; but they roost commonly on Rocks and in Trees, and always set with their Heads to the Wind; so that if the Wind changes whilst they are at roost, they turn about their Heads to the Wind. They are heavy Birds, and fly very slow; and al∣ways, when they sit either on Rocks,
<PB N="72" REF="105"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Trees, or in the Water, they rest their Bills upon their Crop.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guano</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XIX.</NOTE> is a sort of Creature, some of which are found on Land, some in the Water. He is about three foot long, more or less; and is a very ugly Creature to look at; having great, sharp, black and green Scales, from the fore-part of his Head to the end of his Tail; and a set of great and sharp Teeth, with four long Claws upon each Foot. They breed commonly in the Roots of old Trees, near the Water side; and frequent the Water as well as Land. When they are stewed with a little Spice, they make good Broth; and the Flesh looks very white, and eats very well; but if they are not extraordi∣narily well boiled, they are very dange∣rous to eat; making Men very sick, and often putting them into a Feaver, as we were informed by our Prisoners.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Sea-Turtles</HI> there are several sorts, but we always account the green Turtle to be the best Meat. They have several I∣slands and sandy Bays, where they go to lay their Eggs: Which they do in different places at different times. For in some places, as at the Island of <HI>Ascension</HI> in the Atlantick Ocean, their common time of laying is in <HI>April, May, June</HI> and <HI>July.</HI> In other places, as in the Bay of <HI>Motines</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> we took them a∣shore
<PB N="73" REF="106" MS="y"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> laying their Eggs in the Months of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January.</HI> Here in the Gulf of <HI>Nicoya</HI> upon the same Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> in the Latitude of between 10 and 11 d. North, we caught a great many of them, and commonly found them full of Eggs, in the Months of <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September.</HI> Though therefore at one or at several con∣stant places their season of laying is always the same, yet in different places their Seasons are different. I have been at the catching of them in most times of the Year, and commonly found them full of Eggs. When they want to lay, they go ashore in some sandy Bay, and with their Fins make a Hole in the Sand about two foot and a half deep, wherein they lay their Eggs, commonly about eighty or ninety at a time: Then they cover them up with the Sand they had scraped out of the Hole, and so leave them for the heat of the Sun to hatch. Thus they lay two or three times in a Season; and after they have laid, they go off to Sea, and leave the Young, when hatcht, to shift for them∣selves; who, as soon as they get out of the Shell and Sand, retire to the Water. The Eggs are round, about the bigness of a Duck's, with a white, thin, tough Skin over them, but no Shell:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Both the Eggs and the Turtle are extraordinary good Food, as I have experienced many
<PB N="74" REF="107"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> times. I have seen of this sort of Turtle several times from 200 to 350 and 400 weight. The lean of them, before 'tis drest, looks like Beef; but the fat is as green as Grass; and it is very wholesome Food.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pearl-Oyster</HI> is much about the big∣ness of our common Oyster, but more flat and broad. It hangs to the Rocks by a long stringy Beard, like a Muscle. The Pearl lies in the thickest part of it; some have five, six or seven Pearls in them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> make several Voyages to this Gulf of <HI>Nicoya</HI> and to the Island <HI>California</HI> for them. The <HI>Indians</HI> go down in five, six, seven or eight fathom water, and bring up eight, ten, or twelve Oysters at a time, while the Men on board open them. The Meat of this Oyster is very green, and the Oyster fat. I have eaten of this Oyster several times, both boiled and stewed; and found them to be tolerable good Vi∣ctuals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Oyster</HI> grows to the Rocks, as other Oysters; not hanging to them by a Beard, as the Pearl-Oyster. When they are opened, one part looks of a fine Red like a Cherry, the other part is of a fine White. I have eat of this sort of Oyster many times; but it was for want of better Victuals. They are so large, that one of them cut in pieces and stewed, is sufficient for a Meal for five or six Men.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="108"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> The <HI>Muscles</HI> here are so large, that one of them when drest, will suffice two Men; and they are tolerable good Victuals, when stewed with Pepper and Vinegar.</P>
<P>From the middle Islands before-mentio∣ned to the Island of <HI>Chira,</HI> is clear Ground, and six or seven fathom Water. When you sail up the Gulf, you must keep nearer the Islands than the main Land; because near the Main are several Sholes, which stretch a considerable way. From the Island <HI>St Lucas</HI> to Cape <HI>Blanco,</HI> is nine Leagues. Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> lies in the Latitude of 10 d. 20 m. North. It has a small Island at the Point of it, full of high Trees; The Cape is high towards the inner Parts, and appears plain and even. The chief of what they bring from this Gulf, is Salt, Honey, Maiz, some Wheat and Fowls, which they send yearly to <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>On the 23 d of <HI>September,</HI> having done our Business here, we with our little <HI>Dragon</HI> Prize left this place, intending to cruize to the Westward. On the 7th of <HI>October,</HI> we had Latitude by observation 13 d. 07 m. North. Variation 4 d. 30 m. west∣erly; And at the same time we saw the Land, which proved to be two high Mounts, called the Vulcans of <HI>Guatimala;</HI> the one being of Water, the other of Fire. These two famous Mountains stand al∣most the one over-against the other, on
<PB N="76" REF="109"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> each side of the Valley; that of Water be∣ing on the South side, and that of Fire on the North, nearer to the old City. That of Water, is a little higher than the other, and yields a goodly Prospect, be∣ing green all the Year round. In the Year 1534, this Mountain was said to burst open, and threw Water in such large quantities, that it drowned the City of <HI>Guatimala;</HI> which caused the Inhabitants to remove the City three Leagues further off, where it now stands. The Vulcan of Fire, which stands opposite to that of Water, is at some certain times (especially in the rainy Season, which is from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>November,</HI>) very terrible to the Inhabi∣tants. It sometimes throws out Stones as big as a House; and breaks out with such a Flame, that if it be in a dark Night, al∣though you be five or six Miles of, yet by the Light thereof you may see to read a Letter written in a small Hand. This was affirmed to us by several of our Prisoners, Natives of the place.</P>
<P>The 8th, we had dirty squally Weather, with very hard Gusts of Wind from the two Vulcans aforesaid; with such prodigious Claps of Thunder and Flashes of Lightning, as none of us ever saw or heard the like. On the 9th, we took a Bark of about eigh∣ty Tuns, in ballast. She came from <HI>Su∣vartanejo,</HI> and was bound for <HI>Ria Lexa.</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="110"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> She had a small quantity of Provisions, which was very welcome to us. The Captain's name was <HI>Christian Martin,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard</HI> born at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> but brought up in <HI>London.</HI> He was Servant formerly to Captain <HI>Eaton,</HI> and came with him in∣to the South Seas, at which time he was Captain <HI>Eaton</HI>'s Gunner; but falling out with the Men, ran away from them at the Island <HI>Gorgonia,</HI> where he lay concealed six Days till the Ship was gone; after which he cut him down two small Trees, which he drew to the Water-side, and bound them together with Twigs; fixed a Mast; and of two Shirts, which he had with him, made a Sail; and having filled a large Bag with Oysters, which he made fast to the said two Trees, he in the Morn∣ing betimes put off from the Island <HI>Gor∣gonia,</HI> and the next Day in the Afternoon got into the River of <HI>Bonaventure,</HI> where he went ashore, and had but ill usage from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who sent him to <HI>Lima,</HI> where he was examined, cleared himself, and was set at liberty. He could speak very good <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The 15th, we had Latitude by observa∣tion 13 d. 25 m. North. Variation 3 d. 00 m. Westerly, being then off the great Vulcano of <HI>Attitlan.</HI> This Vulcan com∣monly casts out smoak; and under it are 5 small Hills, which are said to be always
<PB N="78" REF="111"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> green. On the 16th, we passed by the Vulcan of <HI>Sapotitlan;</HI> which throws out vast quantities of Fire. This, and the Vulcan of <HI>Sacatapeque,</HI> are reckoned two wonders of the World. We observed off the Vulcan of <HI>Sapotitlan,</HI> and found varia∣tion 2 d. 51 m. Westerly, and had Lati∣tude by observation 13 d. 51 m. North. The 19th, we saw the Hill of <HI>Bernal,</HI> which makes the East point of the Gulf of <HI>Tecoantepeque.</HI> We observed off it, and found the variation, by a good Ampli∣tude, to be 2 d. 45 m. Westerly; and had Latitude 15 d. 00 m. N.</P>
<P>The 20th, we found our selves a-breast of the Bay of <HI>Tecoantepeque,</HI> which is very low Land, and full of little Hills, which look like small Islands. This place is very subject to hard Gales of Wind at N. E. called <HI>Tecoantepequers,</HI> from the place whence they come; and they happen com∣monly about the New and Full Moons. The best way therefore is to keep near the Shore, after you are past the Bay or Gulf. In the Gulf it self, you may keep three or four Leagues off; for it is shoal to that di∣stance: But when you are to the Westward of the Bay, keep within two Leagues of the Shore, that you may come to an anchor if occasion be. For if you should chance to be driven off from Shore, which fre∣quently happens; you will hardly be able to
<PB N="79" REF="112"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> get in four days, so much as you will drive out in one. For when you are driven out of sight of the Land, you will have a strong Current, which will drive you far to the S. W.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> the 11th, in the Even, we saw four small White Islands, lying close together: On the East-end of which, a∣bout two Miles distance, is a large Hum∣mock, which looks like an Island, but is not; the Land going from it to the Main, being very low, causes it, till you are very near it, to look like an Island. This place is called <HI>Suvartaneo,</HI> inhabited by <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> It lies in the Latitude of 17 d. 40 m. N; and has a small Village, of about forty Houses, standing by the Sea-side. Here we anchored in 14 fathom Water, not above Pistol-shot from the Village. At our coming in, we saw about 500 <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> both Horse and Foot. We fired eight or ten of our great Guns at them, and they retired into the Woods. Then we landed about 30 of us, and went to the Village and romaged it. In it we found a great many small things, with 16 Packs of very good Flower. We filled here two Boats load of Water; but the Sea running high, over-set our Boats. Our Men would have set the Village on fire, but the Captain being ashore would not suffer them. So on the 18th we went out with the Land-wind, and stood away to the Westward.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="113"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> The 22d, we anchored in the Bay of <HI>Martaba,</HI> under the Mountains of <HI>Motines.</HI> Here we watered our Ship, and found in a small River a great many large green Turtles, the best I ever tasted. On the 26th, at Sun-setting, we spied a Sail, and immediately got every thing in a readiness for an Engagement, not knowing but it might be the <HI>Manila</HI>-Ship, which we now began to expect shortly to see. VVe were at this time sixty four of us, Men and Boys; all well in Health; and did daily wish to have a sight of the <HI>Manila</HI>-Ship. We soon came up with the Ship we saw, and took her. She was a small Bark, of about sixty Tuns, from <HI>California,</HI> laden with Plank; and she had on board some parcels of Pearl, which they had fish'd in the Gulf of <HI>California.</HI></P>
<P>In this Bay of <HI>Martaba</HI> is a very good anchoring place, defended from the East and North-West Winds. And there is ten and twelve fathom Water, clear Ground. When you are ashore, you will see a little River of fresh Water. It was at this Rivulet that we water'd our Ship, and in it found store of extraordinary large and very good green Turtle. Near the Rivulet is a Road, which strikes up into the Woods. This Road leads to an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, cal∣led <HI>Mavota.</HI> It is said to be four Miles and a half from the Sea-side.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="114"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> To the N. W. of this Bay of <HI>Martaba,</HI> five or six Leagues, towards the Sea-side, you will see broken Ground, which looks like an Island. It is called <HI>Chasipi.</HI> On the S. E. of which, is a little pleasant Valley of pure white Sand, called the Valley of <HI>Maguille;</HI> under the Jurisdiction of the City of <HI>Colima.</HI> Observe that at the Point of <HI>Chasipi,</HI> the <HI>Motines</HI> end. The <HI>Motines</HI> are a long Ridge of Mountains, reaching in length 25 Leagues. They abound in many rich Towns of <HI>Spaniards, Mullat∣toes, Mostese,</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> To the N. W. of the Point of <HI>Chasipi,</HI> you will find a plain even Land towards the Sea-side, which is full of Coco-nut Trees planted here for the use of those Ships which come from the Gulf of <HI>California.</HI> Two or three Leagues distant from this row of Trees, to the N. W. is some broken Ground; and at the end of the broken Ground stands a Vulcan, which is said always to smoak. It is called the Vulcan of <HI>Colima;</HI> and the broken Ground is called the Valley of <HI>Corelan.</HI> It is all planted with Cocoa's, such as we make Chocolate of. This Valley is distant from the Town of <HI>Colima</HI> N. W. 18 Leagues; And not far from the Valley is a Mount very round, called the Mount of St <HI>Jago.</HI> The Mount of St <HI>Jago</HI> is in the Port of <HI>Quelagna.</HI> To know it, you must observe that there is a Rock close by the said

<PB N="82" REF="117"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Mount, which looks very white, and may be seen a great distance. There is a Bay at the end of it, where is a plain of green Trees. If you would go to this Port of <HI>Quelagna,</HI> you must steer streight to the Bay. For there are two very good Har∣bours, which have good Anchor-ground, and will hold a great many Ships: They are called the <HI>Caletas.</HI> On the N. W. side of the said Bay is another very good Port, and close by it is the Port of <HI>Quelagna;</HI> and between the Port of <HI>Quelagna</HI> and the white Rock, is a very good Port, in which you are Land-lock'd from all Winds; and this is called the Port of St <HI>Jago,</HI> but is not inhabited. Five or six Leagues to the N. VV. of the white Rock, is a little Mount; coming near to which, you will see an indifferent high Mount, full of broken Ground, and a Rock joining to it, which is in form of a Sugar-Loaf; and on the N. W. side of that Rock, there is a Bay a League wide.</P>
<P>It was on the 4th of <HI>December,</HI> that we came into this Bay; in which we saw a Sail, stood in after her, and soon took her. All the way we chased her, they heaved their things over-board; after which they all took to their Boat, and got ashore. VVe took possession of the Ves∣sel, which was a new Vessel of about sixty Tuns: And in her we found a great deal
<PB N="83" REF="118"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> of Powder and Shot scattered up and down in all Parts of the Vessel. We sup∣pose therefore that this Ship lay here with Ammunition to supply the <HI>Manila</HI>-Ship; But upon our chacing of her, they threw most of it over-board. This Bay is called the Bay of <HI>Navidad.</HI></P>
<P>From this Bay of <HI>Navidad</HI> or the <HI>Nati∣vity,</HI> we still coasted along to the West∣ward. At the N. W. end of this Port, is another Port which is called <HI>Chametla.</HI> It is a Port defended from the N. W. and S. E. Winds. Two Leagues to the N. W. of it, is an Island; and about it lie four or five Rocks, which come from the main Land; They lie to the N. N. E. and may plainly be seen; and at the East end of them, you may see the Vulcan of <HI>Co∣lima.</HI></P>
<P>On the 6th in the Morning, being off the Vulcan of <HI>Colima,</HI> we saw a Sail, and soon came up with her. She proved to be the <HI>Manila</HI>-Ship. So we, being all provi∣ded, gave her several broad-sides, before she could get any of her Guns clear. For they did not suspect us to be an Enemy, and were not at all prepared for us. Capt. <HI>Martin,</HI> whom I formerly mentioned, was then a Prisoner on board us: He advised to lay her aboard immediately, while they were all in a hurry, and that this would be the only way to take her; but
<PB N="84" REF="119"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> if we gave them so much time as to get out their great Guns, they would certain∣ly beat us in pieces, and we should lose an opportunity of making our selves ma∣sters of the value of sixteen Millions of Pieces of Eight. And accordingly it hap∣pened: For time being delayed in quar∣relling, between those of us that would lay her aboard, and those that would not, the Enemy got out a tire of Guns, and then were too hard for us; so that we could not lie along her side, to do her any considerable damage. For our five Pound shot, which was the biggest we had, signified little against such a Ship as she was; but any of her shot, which were 18 and 24 Pounders, if any of them happen∣ed to strike <HI>Ʋs,</HI> our Ship being very much decayed, it would drive in a piece of Plank of three or four Foot. So being much damaged, and receiving particular∣ly a shot from the Enemy between Wind and Water in our Powder Room; by which we had two foot of Plank driven in on each side the Stem; the Signal was made to stand off from the Enemy.</P>
<P>Thus our Design being disappointed, all our Men grew discontented, and were for going Home; knowing we could do no good in these Parts, either for our selves or Owners; having Provision but for three Months, and that very short; and our
<PB N="85" REF="120"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Ship being ready of her self to fall in Pieces. Our Captain desired our consent to cruize here six Weeks longer, and then he would permit us to go for <HI>India,</HI> to some Friend's Factory, where we might all dispose of our selves, as we should think most for our advantage. To this we all agreed: And accordingly cruized along shore to the Eastward in sight of the Land, and passed by several noted Ports, as <HI>Aca∣pulco,</HI> Port <HI>Angels,</HI> Port <HI>Guatulco,</HI> and se∣veral others: Of which I shall speak in my Description of the Coasts.</P>
<P>Our Design now was to go into the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla,</HI> to new Water our Ship and Bark, for our intended Voyage to <HI>In∣dia.</HI> On the 5th of <HI>January,</HI> 1704/5, we met with vast quantities of Fish; so that in half an hours time, we caught of <HI>Albi∣cores,</HI> from sixty to ninety Pound weight, no fewer than fifty eight. And small Fish of about five Inches, were so numerous, that with a Bucket we haul'd up fourteen, sixteen, eighteen and sometimes twenty at a time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Albicore</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXI.</NOTE> is about four or five Foot in length, some more some less; weighing from 50 to 100 and 150 pound weight. He hath eleven Fins on his back, one pret∣ty large, one middling one, and nine small yellow ones near the Tail. He hath one large Fin on each side near the Gills; and
<PB N="86" REF="121" MS="y"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> 12 Fins under his Belly; one on each side underneath near the Gills, one near the middle of the Belly, and nine small yellow Fins extending to his Tail. It is a very fleshy Fish, having little or no Bones, ex∣cept the Back-bone; and is extraordinary good Victuals. It is a prodigious strong Fish, when in the Water. They prey most∣ly upon the Flying-fish, as do the Dolphins, Bonetoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>On the 6th, it was concluded between Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> and 30 of our Men, to continue in the South-Seas; but upon what Terms this Agreement was made, was kept secret. We who were resolved to go for <HI>India,</HI> used our endeavour to get into the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla</HI> (which was the place we design'd to water at) with all the haste we could. Where we anchor'd on the 26th of <HI>January</HI> 1704/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And the same day; the Provisions being equally parted according to the directions of the Owners Agent; and four great Guns, with some small Arms, Powder and Shot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being ta∣ken out for us; we, (that is, 33 of us who resolved to go in the Bark for <HI>India.</HI>) went on shore in order to water our Vessel for the said Voyage.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT before we go any further, I shall here give a particular Description of the Coast of <HI>Mexico, Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> from the en∣trance of the Gulf of <HI>California</HI> in the La∣titude of 23 d. 30 m. N. to the Port of <HI>Val∣divia</HI> in the Latitude of 40 d. S. so far as I knew them my self, or could get an ac∣count of them from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="126"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> And first, on the main Land you will see the Hill called <HI>Zalisco:</HI> It is a very high Hill, with a bending on the top; and close to this Hill, is a white Rock called <HI>Maxentelbo,</HI> which at three or four Leagues distance looks like a Ship under Sail. And behind the Hill of <HI>Zalisco,</HI> is a great Town of the same Name, inhabi∣ted by <HI>Spaniards, Mullattoes, Mostese</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> And the Main here all along, is full of Cocoa-walks, with Estantions or Farms of Beeves.</P>
<P>The Cocoa-Tree is small, and the Nut or Kernel bigger than an Almond; and ripens in a great Husk, wherein are some∣times 30, nay 40 Cocoas. These Cocoas are made use of to make Chocolate: And as in <HI>England</HI> we go to the Tavern to drink a Glass of Wine, so they do here (upon this Coast of <HI>Mexico</HI>) as frequently go to their Markets to drink a Dish of Choco∣late; And the <HI>Indians</HI> count it a very wholesom Drink. We were glad, whilst we were upon this Coast, to make three Meals a Day of it for near a Month. We would much rather, if we could, have fed upon Flesh: But however, living near a Month upon Chocolate, it made us very fat, and we found that it kept us ve∣ry well in Health. Whether, if we had lived upon it much longer, it would have done us hurt, I know not; but I am apt
<PB N="90" REF="127"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> to believe it would have increased our Fat too fast, and so have made us unheal∣thy.</P>
<P>From the white Rock called <HI>Maxentelbo,</HI> twenty Leagues to the South, are three great Islands called <HI>Maria</HI>'s, and a little one called the <HI>Low Island;</HI> and amongst them are several small Rocks. These Islands are of an indifferent height, and are very full of Wood. The Westermost is the biggest; and between the Islands and the Main, is said to be good ancho∣ring in eight, ten, twelve and fourteen fathom Water, good fast Ground. The Islands are not inhabited; and about them is said to be commonly store of Seals and Turtle, and several sorts of very good Fish. Whether these Islands have any fresh Water upon them, I know not, but I am apt to think they may.</P>
<P>Fourteen Leagues to the S. S. W. of the Islands <HI>Maria</HI>'s, are the Rocks or Islands of <HI>Pontique;</HI> They lie from the Main about a League; You may sail between them and the Main-land, without any danger. They take up two Leagues in length, and the Westermost of them looks like a Ship without a Mast. You may sail between them; for there is no danger, but what is visible. The Land here by the Sea-side is low; but within the Country it is very high and ragged: And about a League to
<PB N="91" REF="128"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> the Eastward of these Islands, is the Point of <HI>Pontique.</HI> This Point at a distance looks like an Island. It is a high round Hill, and very barren; being only a rag∣ged Rock. From this Point to the East∣ward, for fourteen Leagues, runs a deep Bay; and on the North end it is low Land. This Bay is very well inhabited by <HI>Spaniards, Mullattoes, Mostese</HI> and <HI>In∣dians.</HI> Here are a great many Gardens of Cocoa; and all this Bay and the Valleys, are under the Jurisdiction of the Governor of the City of <HI>Compostella.</HI></P>
<P>At the East end of this Bay, is the Cape <HI>Corrientes,</HI> which Cape lies in the La∣titude of about 20 d. 30 m. North. It is high Land, and full of sharp ragged Hills. Observe, when you sail near this Cape, if it blow hard from the N. W. as it com∣monly doth, that four or five Leagues to the S. E. of the Cape, is broken Ground towards the Sea-side. Steer exactly to it, and on the S. E. side of the said broken Ground you will find a good convenient place where you may anchor, and in it you are defended from most Winds. This place is called by the Pilots <HI>Salina's,</HI> because near it they make Salt. The Cape <HI>Cor∣rientes</HI> is very high Land. It hath on it a few Trees; and within the Land, near the said Cape, is a high Mountain, which has three sharp Pikes on the top, somewhat
<PB N="92" REF="129"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> like a Crown: It is called <HI>Coronada</HI> or the Crowned-Mountain. The Sea-winds here∣abouts are commonly at N. W. and the Land-wind at North.</P>
<P>From Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> S. E. by E. run∣neth a great Bay, in which are three or four Islands called the Islands of <HI>Chametly:</HI> they are little low Islands, and between them and the Main there is a very good place to anchor in; and near this ancho∣ring place, the Main is inhabited by <HI>In∣dians,</HI> who are Fishermen, and fish for the City of the <HI>Purification;</HI> Which is a large City, and said to be about fourteen Leagues within Land.</P>
<P>From the Bay of <HI>Chametly</HI> to the S. E. twenty Leagues, is the Port of St <HI>Jago;</HI> a very good Port, in which you are de∣fended from all Winds; but near it are no Inhabitants. Not far from this Port, is the Vulcan of <HI>Alima,</HI> five Leagues with∣in the Land.</P>
<P>From the Port of St <HI>Jago</HI> to the S. E. sixteen Leagues, is the Port of <HI>Navidad</HI> or the <HI>Nativity;</HI> between which two Ports are several small Ports, and many Rocks and Shoals, so that it is bad going into them; and besides, for want of Trade, they are seldom or never made use of by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The Port of <HI>Navidad</HI> is a very good Port, in which is Water and Wood. Here the <HI>Spaniards</HI> build Ships,
<PB N="93" REF="130"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> the biggest they have in these Parts of the World; And here they built the first, that ever was known to sail from <HI>America</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> At this place on the 4th of <HI>December,</HI> we took a new Bark of about fifty Tuns; in which we found some Bacon, Fowls, Bread and Rice, with some Powder and Shot. At our chasing of her, the Men, after they had heaved most of their things over-board, took to their Boat and got ashore. This Port lies in the Latitude of 19 d. 20 m. N.</P>
<P>From hence to the Bay of <HI>Salagua</HI> or Salt-water Bay, is eight Leagues. It was at this place, that Captain <HI>Dampier,</HI> Vol. I. <HI>page</HI> 245, gives an account that the <HI>Manila</HI>-Ship sets ashore her Passengers that are bound for the City of <HI>Mexico:</HI> But now the Vice-roy finding an inconve∣nience in their so doing, has given a po∣sitive Command that they should not put any of their Men or Goods ashore till their arrival at <HI>Acapulco;</HI> Because it was usual with them, when they set ashore their Passengers, to convey away a great deal of the Goods, and so defrauded the King of his Customs.</P>
<P>From this place to the Port <HI>Desapan,</HI> is sixteen Leagues; and half a League with∣in the Land, is a Town called <HI>Jesu-Christo,</HI> said to be a large handsome Town. At this place begin the high Hills called <HI>Mo∣tines,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="131"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> which stretch twenty five Leagues to the S. E. These Hills abound in many rich Towns of <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> And here are abundance of Cocoa-walks, and Farms of Cattle. The Land by the Sea-side, is mountainous and rocky; and by the Water, it is all along planted with Cocoa-nut Trees, for the use of those Ships which come hereabouts and have occasion for Chocolate. Hereabouts you will see the Vulcan of <HI>Colima,</HI> which is said al∣ways to smoak, and sometimes, though seldom, to burst out with Fire. Under these Hills, on the 27th of <HI>November,</HI> we took a Bark of about sixty Tuns, laden with Plank. She came from the Gulf of <HI>California,</HI> where they had been fishing for Pearls; of which we found a few Parcels. Under the same Mountains, in the Bay of <HI>Stabata,</HI> we water'd our Ship, and found a great many very good green Turtle.</P>
<P>At the East end of these Mountains of <HI>Motines,</HI> is the River <HI>Sacaticli;</HI> a League up which River, is a Town of the same Name. Near this River are some pieces of broken Ground, the least of which is Sandy, and has no Trees on the top of it. From hence S. E. to <HI>Estapa</HI> is sixteen Leagues; in all which distance there is neither Hill nor high Land; but in most places 'tis full of Trees, and continues so till you come to a thick green spot of
<PB N="95" REF="132"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Trees. A little to the Eastward of <HI>Estapa,</HI> are some great high Mountains, called the Mountains of <HI>Chequetan.</HI> They lie within Land, and are ten or twelve Leagues in length. To the Eastward of this place, twenty Leagues, is the Mount of <HI>Petap∣lan.</HI> By this Mount are a great many Cocoa-walks, and near ro the Cocoa-walks is the Town of <HI>Petaplan,</HI> which stands behind the Mountain. This Town is said to be a large Town and very well inhabited. The Land near it is full of small Hills and Valleys: The Hills are barren, but the Valleys are said to be green almost all the Year. The Hill of <HI>Petaplan,</HI> is a high Hill: At a distance it looks like an Island; and about it are a great many Rocks, but all visible; so that if you please, you may go between them; where, if occasion be, you may anchor, and will not find less than nine, ten, or eleven fathom Water: This Hill I make to lie in the Latitude of 17 d. 25 m. North. From hence to the Port of <HI>Acapulco,</HI> is eight Leagues, all along a sandy Bay, and low even Land.</P>
<P><HI>Acapulco</HI> is a Port of great Trade. It is the place where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> embark from <HI>Mexico</HI> for <HI>China</HI> and the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands: Which is a particular Priviledge it has: For no other Port durst trade to any part of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> but from hence. It is
<PB N="96" REF="133"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> distant from the City of <HI>Mexico</HI> eighty Leagues, and all Goods are carried from hence thither on Mules, though it is a very bad way. This is the chief Port for <HI>Mexico</HI> on the whole West-side of <HI>America.</HI> It is a very good and large Port, and in it may lie a hundred Sail of Ships, all Land∣lock'd and secure from all Winds and Weather. It lies in the Latitude of 17 d. 06 m. North. The Town consists of a∣bout 120 Families, most <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and has for its defence a Castle of between forty and fifty Brass Guns, each said to carry a thirty-six pound Ball. The Castle stands in a Valley between two noted Hills; one of which is almost like a Sugar-loaf, and the other is cut in two at the top; this is called the Hill <HI>Cauca:</HI> These Hills are the highest Land herea∣bouts, and both to the East and West of them it is all low Land for several Leagues. The Town stands at the N. W. end of the Harbour, in a deep Bay; It is said to be a pretty compacted Town. If you would enter into this Port, bring the Hill <HI>Cauca</HI> to bear N. ½ E. from you; then go to the S. E. of the Island, which is at the Mouth of the Harbour, called the <HI>least Island;</HI> and after that, have a care of coming near a dangerous Shole, called the <HI>Grifo.</HI> But if the Wind should be Northerly, then you may go to the westward of the great Island.
<PB N="97" REF="134"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> This is the <HI>China</HI>-Ships entrance; It is the narrowest Channel, and the Water is very deep; but Ships coming from the East∣ward come in at the East Channel, between the Main and a great Shole of Sand; but in their Entrance, keep as near the Main as they can. You may know this Port by the high Land; for it is all low to the East and West of it; and all along for several Leagues, sandy Bays.</P>
<P>A League from this Port of <HI>Acapulco,</HI> is Port <HI>Marquis.</HI> It is a very good Port, and in it is good Wood and Water. And here are three or four <HI>Indian</HI> Houses, belonging to Fishermen, who fish for the Town of <HI>Acapulco.</HI> A little to the Eastward of these Houses, are 3 small Islands, with some <HI>In∣dian</HI> Fishermens Houses on them: And here they dry a great deal of Fish, with which they supply their Town and Ships at <HI>A∣capulco.</HI></P>
<P>From these three small Islands, to the River of <HI>Naguala,</HI> is six Leagues. It is a small River, with only five or six poor Fishermens Houses; from whence by Land is a good Path leading to <HI>Acapulco;</HI> and by Sea it is a bold Coast, and deep Wa∣ter.</P>
<P>From the River of <HI>Naguala,</HI> to the Fish∣ing-place of <HI>Don Garcia</HI> S. E. is five Leagues; all even Land, and a sandy Bay. Here live 15 or 20 <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves, who dry

<P>From the Fishing-place of <HI>Don Garcia,</HI> to the Hill of <HI>Cecorillo,</HI> S. E. is six Leagues; and near the Water-side, all even Land, and sandy. This Hill of <HI>Cecorillo,</HI> is a small round Hill, close to the Water-side; and right against it, about a League from the Shore, are five or six Rocks; and all round them it is shole water.</P>
<P>From the Hill of <HI>Cecorillo,</HI> to the River of <HI>Taclamanca,</HI> is two Leagues. Here live eight or ten Families of <HI>Indian</HI> Peo∣ple, who employ their Time in fish∣ing.</P>
<P>From the River <HI>Taclamanca,</HI> to Point <HI>Gallera,</HI> is eight or nine Leagues. The first four Leagues the Land is all along Wood; and the other half way, it is broken Ground by the Sea-side; there being seven Cliffs of a whitish Colour; And off of these Cliffs, about a league distance from the shore, are several Shoals; and for two Leagues off, you have scarce two fathom Water.</P>
<P>From Point <HI>Gallera</HI> to the Morro or Mount of <HI>Hermoso,</HI> is seven Leagues; the Land mountainous within, and full of little Rocks by the Sea-side. This Mount of <HI>Hermoso,</HI> is a plain Mount, and at the top very even; and about a Mile from the shore, right off the said Mount, is a great Sand, on which several good Ships have

E. of this Sand, is a hilly Island, a league from the Main, called <HI>Alcatrazes;</HI> and over-against it is a fresh Water River, where you may water your Ship if you have occasion: Here live several <HI>Indian</HI> People, with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Friar; And round about the Island are several small Islands, or rather Rocks: And from the Main, on the East-side of the Island, cometh out a Shoal of Rocks and Sand, which stretch off to Sea as far as the Island: Therefore it is dangerous going in at the East-end; but at the West∣end you may safely go in; and on the in∣side of the Island is a good anchoring place.</P>
<P>Upon this Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> for the most part the Land-winds are at N. W. and N. N. W. and the Sea-winds, from the W. to the S. W. according as the Land trends away. So that all the way, if you keep within eighty or ninety Leagues of the Land, you must make use of the Land and Sea-breezes, which commonly blow here∣abouts pretty fresh. The Land here, is not very high: It is woody; but with∣in the Country mountainous. Here are seven or eight whitish Cliffs by the Sea∣side, which are very remarkable, because there are none so white and thick toge∣ther on all the Coast.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From the Island <HI>Alcatrazes</HI> to the Port of <HI>Escondedo,</HI> is eight Leagues; Its East Point butting into the Sea more by half a League than the West. It is a smooth and good Port, and here is good wooding and watering. Near this Port is a little Island, which makes the Port; within which Island you may ride with great Se∣curity from the West and South-west Winds, and may venture to go ashore without any danger: And from this Port is a Road leading to several great Towns in the Country.</P>
<P>From <HI>Escondedo</HI> to the River <HI>Messias,</HI> is six Leagues; and between <HI>Escondedo</HI> and the River <HI>Messias,</HI> is the River of <HI>Aqua Dulce</HI> or Sweet-water-River; right against which are two Rocks, one on each side. At the Mouth of the River <HI>Messias,</HI> is fresh Water; and in the times of the Rains, it overflows its Banks, and hin∣ders the Inhabitants in their Affairs, and very often drowns many of their Cattle, which feed near the Banks of it. The Banks of this River are very well peopled with <HI>Indians.</HI> But hereabouts, the Coast is much troubled with Calms. Off from this River <HI>Messias,</HI> at a league distance, is a large Island, which has several small Islands, or rather Rocks about it.</P>

Right off this River of <HI>Gal∣lera,</HI> about three quarters of a Mile from the Main, and six Leagues to the West∣ward of Port <HI>Angels,</HI> is a small rocky Island; between which and the Main, is very good anchoring in fifteen, sixteen and seventeen fathom Water. The Sea-winds hereabouts, are commonly at W. S. W. and S. W. and the Land-winds at North. Whether there be any Water upon this Island I do not know; but never heard of any, neither could any of our Prisoners tell us the name of it. It has some small Trees, or rather Bushes growing on it; but they are fit for no use.</P>
<P>From this Island, as I said before, to the Port <HI>Angels,</HI> is six Leagues. It is a good Port, and seldom without shipping. Here is a small Town of about thirty Houses, inhabited mostly by <HI>Spaniards;</HI> The Town is situated on the West-side of the Port, and in the Town are said to be two pretty little Churches. This Town has great trading to it, for Hides and Tallow; and sends a great quantity of Goods by Land to <HI>Mexico,</HI> and several other In-land Towns and Villages. VVhen you enter this Port, you must keep to the Eastward of a Rock and Shoal. The Port lies in the

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Latitude of 15 d. 45 m. North. Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> in Vol. I. <HI>page</HI> 232, makes the Port of <HI>Guatulco</HI> to lie in the Latitude of 15 d. 30 m.

VV. and E. S. E. The Tide rises and falls five foot; the Flood setting to the N. E. and the Ebb to the S. W.</P>
<P>From Port <HI>Angels</HI> to the <HI>Caletta,</HI> is two Leagues. It is a very good Port, but hath neither VVood nor fresh VVater. Have a great care of four or five Rocks, which lie out from its S. E. Point, stretching a Mile and half into the Sea. Between the <HI>Caletta</HI> and Port <HI>Angels,</HI> is said to be a ve∣ry dangerous Shoal, and that it bears from the Point of Port <HI>Angels</HI> S. S. E. distance one League.</P>
<P>The Port <HI>Angels</HI> is in form like to <HI>Gua∣tulco,</HI> but not so broad nor so good; though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> reckon it to be an extraordinary Port, yet there is a great deal of difference between it and <HI>Guatulco.</HI> In Port <HI>Angels</HI> are several anchoring places;
<PB N="103" REF="140"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> On the S. E. side you will ride most se∣cure, because it keeps you from the Winds. There is high Land on each side, and on the West-side is a Rock, and with∣out the Rock is a Shoal of Sand: With∣in the Rock are two little <HI>Caletta's</HI> or Bays, in which is good anchoring for a small Vessel; and in each of these two Bays is a little Brook of fresh Water, which have their beginning from a plain of Sand; and if you go to the end of the Plain, you will see their Head. In this Port are very good Trees, that upon occa∣sion will serve to make Masts for Ships. Here are also a great many Farms of Beeves, with good store of Maiz, Hogs, Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And here they make Salt not only to serve their own occasions, but also to supply several Towns and Villages here∣abouts.</P>
<P>From this Port of <HI>Angels</HI> to the Port of <HI>Guatulco,</HI> is 16 Leagues. In the way are several Rocks, Islands and Rivers. At the Island <HI>Sacrificio,</HI> on the inside, is secure riding from all Winds, in five, six, and se∣ven fathom water. And here you may wood and water your Ship, if you have oc∣casion. Hereabouts are excellent Pearls, found in seven fathom water. This Port of <HI>Guatulco</HI> is famous for its being taken by our <HI>English</HI> Hero Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in the Year 1579; who in one House took a

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Bushel of Money. It was afterwards taken and burnt by Sir <HI>Tho. Cavendish</HI> in the year 1587.

It is all along high and mountainous Land. The Port lieth hid, and you cannot see it till you come within a League of it. About a League from the Port, is a small round Island, called <HI>Tangola;</HI> which is full of Hills and Trees. And close by the West Point of the Port, is a Rock; and three quarters of a mile to the Eastward of the Rock, and in the middle of the entrance of the Port, lieth the <HI>Buffadore;</HI> which is a small Rock; and when the Winds blow at S.

Every Night we saw abundance of Fires up and down in the Valleys: These Fires were made to burn down the Timber, the Ashes of which they reckon does mightily fatten the Land: For after the Trees and Bushes are burnt down, the Ashes of them makes the Land look very black; but in a Fortnights time, if they chance to have two or three showers of Rain, the Land will look very green and pleasant. This is the best and only way they have of fattening their Land. Near to this Vulcan of <HI>Soco∣nusco,</HI> to the S.

Behind this Vulcan is said to be the great City of <HI>Gua∣timala,</HI> which consists of 8500 Families, besides the Suburbs called <HI>St Domingo;</HI> in which may be about 350 Families more, besides innumerable of <HI>Mullattoes, Mostese</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> It is accounted, next to <HI>Li∣ma</HI> and <HI>Mexico,</HI> to be the biggest and best traded City in all <HI>America.</HI> It is govern'd by a President; who in his own Territo∣ries, is as great as the Vice-Roys, (of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico,</HI>) and is not subordinate to either of Them, but only to the Council of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Natives of this place are very expert in Feather-work. They will make either Fish, Fowl, or Beast; Flow∣ers, Trees, Herbs and Roots to admirati∣on; nay, they will for a whole Day eat no∣thing, only to place one Feather in its due Perfection; turning and tossing the Feather to the light of the Sun, and then in the Shade, to see in which it looks best, and so accordingly place it. At this place groweth abundance of Cocoa.

Along the Coast is very high Land. When you are right off the Port of <HI>Sonsonate,</HI> you will have the Valley of <HI>Salvadore</HI> open, where stands a Church and a small Town called <HI>Guagamoco.</HI> The chief Commodity along this Coast, is Cocoa: There is some trading from <HI>Mexico</HI> to this place, and from Port <HI>Cavalles</HI> in the North Sea; but the most and greatest Trade they have, is from the two great Empires of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili.</HI></P>
<P>From Point <HI>Remidias</HI> to the Vulcan of <HI>Isalco,</HI> is three leagues. This Vulcan at certain times smoaks very much, and about it are great heaps of Ashes. You may know it by its being situated amongst a great many high Mountains, that are higher than it; and you may see them from the end of the Deserts of <HI>Balsamo.</HI> From this Vulcan begin the Mountains of <HI>Morcois.</HI> Although it has abundance of smoak issuing out of it, yet I never heard that it cast out any thing else.</P>
<P>From this Vulcan of <HI>Isalco</HI> to the Vul∣can of St <HI>Salvadore,</HI> is five Leagues. The appearance of it is like unto a Turks Turbant. Between the two said Vulcans, close by the Sea-side, is the <HI>Barnadillo,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="157"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> which is a high steep Rock, on one side appearing like a Pyramid. And mid-way between the <HI>Barnadillo</HI> and the Vulcan of St <HI>Salvadore,</HI> is a fresh Water River, whose Banks are very well peopled with <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>From the Vulcan of <HI>St Salvadore</HI> to the great Vulcan of <HI>Sacatelepa,</HI> is six leagues. This Vulcan stands near the Sea-side. In the Year 1643, it was said to burst out, throwing out Sulphur and Ashes, which stopt the ways, and spoiled several Fields of Corn.</P>
<P>From hence to the great River of <HI>Lem∣pa,</HI> is one league. That River has a great many Sands at the Mouth; but they are visible; so that you may steer in amongst them, without any danger. It is one of the biggest (if not the biggest) on the West-side of the Empire of <HI>Mexico.</HI> It is also said by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be a privi∣ledged River; so that a Man who hath committed Murther, or any other Crime worthy of Death or Imprisonment, if he can make his escape to the other side, he is free so long as he liveth there; and no Justice or any Other on that side, can que∣stion or any way trouble him for the said Crime. At this River <HI>Lempa</HI> begins the pleasant Country of <HI>St Michaels.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>St Michaels</HI> is a large Town, said to consist of eight hundred <HI>Spanish</HI> Families, and hath seven fair and
<PB N="118" REF="158"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> very rich Churches in it, with several small Chapels: And behind a great Vulcan, called the Vulcan of <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> is a great <HI>Lagune,</HI> whose Borders are very well peo∣pled, with a mixture of <HI>Spaniards, Mullat∣toes, Mostese</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> In a place here called the <HI>Red Creek,</HI> are said to be built Ships of 800 Tuns. This Country is ve∣ry plentiful of all Necessaries. The Earth brings forth Corn, Wine and Oil, almost without Man's help. At the Mouth of the River of <HI>St Michael</HI> (on the Banks of which the Town is situated) you will at low water have two fathom. In going in, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> always keep the Vulcan due North: And then there is no danger. It was from this Vulcan that we took our de∣parture, when we quitted these parts to proceed on our Voyage for <HI>India.</HI> Over the River of <HI>St Michaels,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have built a wooden Bridge. The Coast still continues to run North East and South West.</P>
<P>Near to the Vulcan of St <HI>Michaels,</HI> is the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla.</HI> This Gulf is eight or nine leagues deep, and four wide. At its Mouth are two large Islands; the one cal∣led <HI>Amapalla,</HI> and the other <HI>Mangera;</HI> and within is the Island <HI>Conchagua;</HI> at which we wooded and watered our Bark at our going to <HI>India.</HI> There are a great many other Islands in the Gulf; but none of
<PB N="119" REF="159"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> them inhabited, except <HI>Mangera</HI> and <HI>Ama∣palla. Amapalla</HI> is the biggest, and on it is a small <HI>Indian</HI> Town or two of the same Name. There are two entrances in∣to this Gulf; the one between Point <HI>Casi∣vina</HI> and the Island <HI>Mangera;</HI> and the o∣ther between the Island <HI>Mangera,</HI> and the Island of <HI>Amapalla:</HI> But that between Point <HI>Casivina</HI> and the Island <HI>Mangera,</HI> has the deepest Water; yet it is better going in at the other, because with the Sea-wind you can run in at once. The nearer you come to any of these Islands, you will find the Water the deeper; For the Gulf is mostly shallow Water; And we were forced to keep the Lead going. At our coming out in our Bark, between <HI>Amapalla</HI> and <HI>Mangera</HI> we had often not above two fathom Water. The chief Town of <HI>Amapalla</HI> is mightily increased of late. For in it there is now said to be above a hundred <HI>Spanish</HI> Houses. It hath a great Traffick for its Cochineel, Cocoa, Hides, Indico, and all sorts of Provisions. It is govern'd by a <HI>Teniente</HI> under the Pre∣sident of <HI>Guatimala.</HI> There is another Village at the bottom of the Gulf, called <HI>Chuluteca.</HI> In it are about thirty or forty <HI>Indian</HI> Houses, with not above two or three <HI>Spaniards</HI> amongst them. They live by selling Provisions, which they truck for other Commodities; But these

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> two or three <HI>Spaniards</HI> will not suffer the poor <HI>Indians</HI> to trade for themselves, say∣ing, that Strangers will cheat them; and fail not to do it themselves, of three fourths of what they are entrusted with. Were it not for these unlawful shifts, the lazy <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not grow so rich as they do. Here are a great many Sands, Rivers and Shoals in this Gulf; and the chief place of anchoring for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships, is on the N. E. side of the Island of <HI>Amapalla</HI> in nine, ten and eleven fathom:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXV</NOTE> Although we anchored at the Island <HI>Con∣chagua.</HI> The Island of <HI>Amapalla</HI> makes the West, as Point <HI>Casivina</HI> does the East point of the Gulf. The Point <HI>Casivina</HI> is a high rocky Point, which at a distance looks like an Island. It lies in the Lati∣tude of 12 d, 45 N. and I reckon Longi∣tude from <HI>London</HI> West, 97 d. 30 m. We found here 3 d. 26 m. westerly variation. The water we found to rise and fall nine Foot; and it is very full of Worms. At this place we caught several sorts of Fish; but the most remarkable was the <HI>Shovel∣nos'd-Shark,</HI> and a Fish by the <HI>Indians</HI> called a <HI>Ceawau.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Shovel-nos'd-Shark</HI> is in all respects the same as the common one; Only his Head is like a Colliers Shovel, and the two extreme parts (at the edge of which on each side are his Eyes) go a great deal

<P>The <HI>Ceawau</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXVI.</NOTE> was a Fish of about four Foot long. He had three Fins on his Back; <HI>viz.</HI> one small one at the hinder∣part of his Head, a great one near the middle of his Back, and another small one towards his Tail. He had also two small ones underneath, near the Gills; and two small ones underneath, near the Tail; with two pretty large ones on each side, near the Gills. He had a large Mouth, and Teeth. He was an extraordinary good Fish; and his Head, when boiled, was nothing but a pure good Jelly. He was full of small Spots and Partings, as is express'd in the Figure. And the tip of his Fins and Tail was Yellow.</P>
<P>From the Point of <HI>Casivina</HI> to the <HI>Messa de Roldon,</HI> or the Hill of <HI>Roldon,</HI> is 5 leagues. It is a plain Hill; and at the top is a Table; near which is the Port of <HI>Martin Lopez;</HI> a fine Port, but very seldom made use of, for want of Trade. It is a very noted place, having on the top of it a great many white Clifts.</P>
<P>From this Port to the South East, di∣stance four leagues, is the Port of <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> by some called <HI>Rio Leon.</HI> It is a good and safe Port from all Winds. If
<PB N="122" REF="163"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> you would enter this Port, keep the largest of the two Islands on the Larboard side: This Island, which you must leave on the Larboard side, is all Savannah: And when you are within it, bear off from the Land on the Starboard side, (for from the Main come many dangerous Sholes;) Then sail directly to the Anchoring-place, which is right against a small River on the said Island, and is three leagues before you come to the River. At the Anchoring-place, the Harbour is pretty broad; but from thence it turns away to the West, and grows narrower till you come to the Town, which is situated upon the River <HI>Lexa</HI> or <HI>Leon.</HI> It is said to consist of about eight hundred and fifty Families, being a mix∣ture of <HI>Spaniards, Mullattoes, Mostcse,</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> The Houses are said to be very well built, of Brick and Stone; and that it hath five or six large Churches in it. As you come from Sea, the Mouth of this Port is hard to be seen; but look to the Vulcan of <HI>Vejo,</HI> and steer towards it; and you will see a Point, and near it a Rock, which is as high as a Ship: Make towards that Rock, and you will see a rising, until you open the Mouth, whose entry is at the North West part, and the Vulcan in the Harbour lies East. When you are in, you will find it all low Land, except the Vulcan of <HI>Vejo,</HI> which is a very great and high Vul∣can,

The Islands are very low; so that every Tide they are over∣flown: And upon this low and swampy Land are abundance of Mangrove-Trees.

<P>From the Vulcan of <HI>Telica</HI> to the Vulcan of <HI>Leon Mamotombo,</HI> is six leagues. This Vulcan formerly burst out at the top with Fire, and was said to do much hurt to all the Country for nine or ten Miles round; but it has ceased since, and suffers the In∣habitants to live in peace; altho' some∣times it will smoak; all the sulphurous Matter being not quite exhausted. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> tell a Story of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Friar, who thought to have discovered some Treasure within this Vulcan, which might enrich himself and all the Country; he being possest in his own Mind that the stuff which burned within this Mount, was Gold; whereupon he caused a great Iron-Kettle to be made, and hung it to an Iron-Chain, and let it down, thinking to draw up Gold enough to buy him a Bishoprick; but such was the power and great heat of the Fire within, that he had no sooner let it down, but both Kettle and Chain melted away, and so frustrated the poor Friar of his hoped for Bishoprick.

<P>From the Mountain of <HI>Martiare</HI> to the Port of St <HI>John,</HI> is five leagues. In this Port they commonly build small Vessels; but here often runs so great a Sea, that no Boat can go ashore, unless by chance. This is a pretty good Port, and in it you are defended from the N. W. and other Northerly Winds. At the East point of this Port lie four small Islands, or rather Rocks, which make a good defence for the Port against S. E. Winds; and at the bot∣tom of the Port, in the middle, is a River of fresh Water.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="168"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From hence to the Point of St <HI>Catharine,</HI> is fifteen leagues.

From this Gulf you will see within Land the great Vulcan of <HI>Granada;</HI> and near the Sea∣side stands the Vulcan of <HI>Bombacho;</HI> both casting out much smoak. They are two noted Vulcans; That of <HI>Granada,</HI> up in the Country, is in form of a Bee-Hive; the other of <HI>Bombacho,</HI> which stands near the Sea-side, hath three high Peeks on the top of it. In the middle of the Gulf, is a River of fresh Water; but the Sea falls with so great force upon the Shore, that there is no landing near it: And in the middle of the Gulf, by the Sea-side, the Land is low; till you come to the great Mountain of <HI>Popogajo;</HI> which is a vast high Mountain, and is in form of a Sugar∣loaf. It is called <HI>Popogajo,</HI> from the abun∣dance of Parrots that continually resort about it. This Mountain stands upon the Point of St <HI>Catharine,</HI> which is low Land; and off it lie two Rocks or small Islands.</P>
<P>From these Rocks or small Islands to the Port of <HI>Velas,</HI> is nine leagues. The Coast runs N. N. W. and S. S. E. About
<PB N="127" REF="169"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> three leagues to the S. E. of the Point of St <HI>Catharine,</HI> are two Rocks more, which are of a whitish Colour: And from thence to the S. E. distance two leagues, is a Ri∣ver of fresh Water, called the River of <HI>Velas;</HI> but at the Mouth of it, are several Sands and Shoals. At this River to the South Eastward the Land begins to be mountainous. In the Port of <HI>Velas</HI> is the Vulcan of <HI>Zapanzas;</HI> and in the East part of the Port, near the Port, are many Sands stretching from the shore for a mile. At the bottom of the Port, which is at the S. E. end, is a good fresh Water Ri∣ver; at which you may water your Ship if occasion be: And right off the said Ri∣ver, is the anchoring place. To the West of the anchoring place, is a bluff Point stretching out into the Sea; and about this Point are a great many Shoals and Rocks, with foul Ground, which stretch near three leagues into the Sea. Come not near them, for they are very dange∣rous. These Rocks are called <HI>Velas,</HI> be∣cause at a distance they look like a Ship under Sail.</P>
<P>From these Rocks to the Mount of <HI>Her∣mozo,</HI> is seven leagues, S. S. E. This <HI>Her∣mozo</HI> is a high Hill, but higher at the West than East end. It runs out butting into the Sea, and from thence grows high∣er and higher within Land. At this
<PB N="128" REF="170"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Mount of <HI>Hermozo,</HI> you may see the Port of <HI>Velas:</HI> And between these two places is a little high Island, which is two leagues from the shoar. Whether there be any sailing for a Ship between it and the Main, I know not.</P>
<P>From the Mount of <HI>Hermozo</HI> to the Cape of <HI>Gajones,</HI> is eight Leagues. The Coast runs S. E. by E. and N. W. by W. all a∣long mountainous and very bad and rocky, and no port for any Ship to anchor in. The Cape of <HI>Gajones,</HI> is a very noted Cape: It is not altogether so high as the Mount of <HI>Hermozo;</HI> but on the top it is very even and plain. It goes down on the West with a bending like a Saddle, which joins it to the Mount of <HI>Hermoso;</HI> and also on the East it bends down in like manner, and is join∣ed to another Mountain, which Mountain is plain and even on the top, and in all re∣spects looks like the Cape of <HI>Gajones;</HI> only the Cape of <HI>Gajones</HI> is something fuller of Trees; and to know them from each other, you must note that the Westermost of the said two even Mountains, is the Cape.</P>
<P>From the Cape of <HI>Gajones,</HI> to Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> is twelve leagues. In the way are two dangerous Shoals; they lie distant from the Main about one league, and at low Water may be seen almost dry. Be∣tween the two aforesaid Capes is a small

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Bay, called the Bay of <HI>Caldera.</HI> Your best anchoring is at the North-part of it, at which place you may see the River of <HI>Sparca,</HI> distant about half a league; at which is said to be excellent good wood∣ing and watering; and upon the Banks of the River are situated several small <HI>Indian</HI> Towns and Villages. Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> or <HI>White Cape,</HI> is the Westermost Point of the Gulf of <HI>Nicoya;</HI> as the <HI>Herradura</HI> is the East. The Cape lies in the Latitude of 10 d. 20 m. North. To the N. W. of it, lie three small low Islands, distant from it about a league. The Cape is high Land, but higher within Land than near the Wa∣ter-side. It is very full of tall Trees of several sorts; and at the pitch of the Cape is a small Island very full of Trees. The Land is of a whitish Colour, perhaps occasioned by the Dung of Fowls; of which there are a great many that resort thither, as they do to all the Islands in the Gulf. This Island at a distance looks as if it joined to the Cape; and it being of a whitish Colour, as I said before, gives name to the Cape. From this Cape <HI>Blan∣co</HI> Northward along the Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> until you come to the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla,</HI> many times for two or three days together, you will meet with hard Gales of Wind from the Land, which are called <HI>Popaga∣jos:</HI> These Winds are very frequent in the

In this same Gulf, in the Year 1704, near the Island <HI>Saint Lucas,</HI> we took a Bark of about forty Tuns. She had on board some Wine, Brandy and Sugar, with five or six <HI>Indian</HI> Carpenters and Caulkers, who came in a good time to help us to clean our Ship, and to refit her, if we had plank to do it with. At a heap of small Islands lying in the middle of the Gulf, called the <HI>Middle Islands,</HI> we hauled our Ship ashore, (as has been before related,) and cleaned her as well as we could. We found the Water here at Nepe-tides to rise and fall eight foot; at Spring-tides, more. We lay here about two Months; and refitted, wooded and watered our Ship. Near the Cape is a small Village of <HI>Indians;</HI> and before the Village are a great many Sands,

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Rocks and Shoals; so that it is very diffi∣cult landing near it; but not far of, are two good anchoring places. On the o∣ther side of the Gulf, almost right against this Village, is the little Bay, called the Bay of <HI>Caldera;</HI> and right over the Bay, is a plain even Land, called the Table of <HI>Macotela;</HI> near to which are two or three poor <HI>Indian</HI> Fishermens Houses. All Ships bound for <HI>Nicoya</HI> anchor at the Island of <HI>Chira;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXVII.</NOTE> from whence the Town of <HI>Nicoya</HI> is distant about ten Leagues; consisting of about seventy or eighty Houses, being a mixture of <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> This is said to be a pretty well compacted Town, and Head of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Govern∣ment. It is governed by an Alcade or Mayor. From it come Fowls, Salt, Ho∣ney, and other Provisions, which they yearly send to <HI>Panama</HI> in small Vessels. The <HI>Nicoyans</HI> are a People of a middle Stature, and tawny Complexion. Before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he coming of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they had very good Laws among themselves; only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey had no Law against a Man's killing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Father, Mother, or King: They, as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uppose, thinking no Man would or could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e so very wicked, as to murder either his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn Parents, or the common Father of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em all, whom they used to adore as a God.

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> robs, till by his Service he has made Sa∣tisfaction. This Gulf is very much infest∣ed with Worms. To some of these Islands the <HI>Spaniards</HI> frequently come to fish for Pearl, of which they often make very profitable Voyages. Here are also vast numbers of extraordinary good Sea-turtle: And up most of the Rivers (of which here are a great many) are several good Plan∣tain-walks, at which we got store of Plantains. In the Island of <HI>Chira,</HI> which lyes at the bottom of this Gulf of <HI>Nicoya,</HI> (and which, as I said before, is the com∣mon anchoring place for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships which trade to <HI>Nicoya,</HI>) is a small Vil∣lage of <HI>Indians,</HI> of about thirteen or four∣teen Houses, built of Palmeto Leaves. Here Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> formerly filled his Water in a Pond near the Sea-side: And here the poor <HI>Indians</HI> related to them the sad usage they met with from their cruel Masters the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who make them work for them, because they have nothing to pay them tribute with. They have a small Chapel here; and here they used formerly to make a great many Earthen Jars; but now the <HI>Indians</HI> are most of them run away, to get free from their cruel Masters the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> In this Gulf are Sea-turtle, and Fish of several sorts. Of Birds, here are the Pelican, the Car∣rion-crow, and the Maccaw Birds; of
<PB N="133" REF="176"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> which I have already given a Descripti∣on.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Herradura</HI> which makes the East-point of this Gulf of <HI>Nicoya,</HI> to the River <HI>Estrella</HI> or Star-River, is eleven Leagues. The Coast runs N. W. by W. and S. E. by E; the Land something mountainous and steep. Near this River are the <HI>Sierras de los Coronados,</HI> or the Crowned Mountains. These are very noted Mountains, so that there is none like them on all the Coast. They are five or six Ridges of Mountains, each gradu∣ally surmounting the other; and those within the Land are highest. At the West end of these Mountains are four Rocks, called by the <HI>Spaniards Farallones de Queipo.</HI> You may sail between them and the Main, and there is deep Water enough. These Rocks are bare, having no Trees or Bushes on them.</P>
<P>From hence to the Island <HI>Caneo,</HI> is four Leagues. This Island is a League round, and indifferent high Land, well clothed with streight and tall Trees. It lies in the Latitude of 10 d. N. The anchoring place is on the N. E. side, in fourteen fathom Water, a quarter of a Mile off the shore; where you may wood and water. Upon this Island are said to be some few wild Hogs; but for what purpose they were first set ashore here, I know not:
<PB N="134" REF="177"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> For the Island is uninhabited. There ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> several small Islands and shoals, which ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about it towards the North and West and to the N. E. by E. is <HI>Punta mala</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bad Point; and within this <HI>Punta mala</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a deep and fine Bay, wherein Sir <HI>Thoma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cavendish</HI> formerly cleaned his Ship. The shore is full of Shoals; therefore keep a good League off it. <HI>Punta mala</HI> is low, and from it there stretch out several Sands and Shoals; and in the middle of the Sands is a small Island, which at a distance shows like a Ship under sail. It is an even Country, but very woody; and in the Woods are said to be store of Deer. The Coast runs N. W. by W. and S. E. by E.</P>
<P>From <HI>Punta mala</HI> to the <HI>Golfo Dulce</HI> or sweet Gulf, is nine Leagues; the Land pretty even and woody. Within this Gulf is a very good Harbour, and the Water is very smooth. This is accounted as good a Gulf to ride in, as the Gulf of <HI>Nicoya;</HI> and in it you are secure from all Winds; nay even from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves; for the Sea-Coast is clear of them; but here are <HI>Indians,</HI> who are very friendly to the <HI>English.</HI> They are but few, and live here to shun the <HI>Spani∣ards.</HI> Yet they are obliged to pay half the Fish they catch, to the Fryar of a Town which is four Leagues up in the
<PB N="135" REF="178"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Country. They have here store of Honey, Plantains, and Cassavy-root. Here are two Rivers at the bottom of this Gulf, where there is good wooding and water∣ing; and here is good laying a Ship a ground to clean; for the Water rises and and falls nine or ten Foot at Spring-tides. The Country is mountainous and very woody; and here are a great many Walks of Plantains and Coco-nuts; and in the Woods are store of wild Deer. At the West-entrance of this Gulf are two Rocks, from which to the Point of <HI>Burica</HI> is five Leagues. This is a low Point, running into the Sea. From the Southward it shows like two Islands. It is shoal a good way off; therefore with a great Ship keep a good League and half off shore. This Point is full of Coco-nut-trees. Right off it, distance about a League and half, is a Rock; and there is no going between it and the said Point. To the Eastward of the Point of <HI>Burica,</HI> (which lyes in the Latitude of 09 d. 00 m. N.) the Land makes a long and deep Bay, in which are a great many Islands Rivers, Rocks, Shoals and Sands; but the most noted is the River of <HI>Chirique,</HI> which lyes in the middle and bottom of the Bay, and on the Banks of which is situated a <HI>Spanish</HI> Town of the same Name with the River. In it are about fifty Houses, built of Brick,
<PB N="136" REF="179"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> and covered with Palmeto-leaves. You may see hence within the Land a Hill cal∣led <HI>Barn,</HI> at whose Foot is another small Town of about forty or fifty Houses. The Trade here is mostly for <HI>Muntego,</HI> (But∣ter,) Indigo, Pitch, Tarr, and Provisions of all sorts; which is the common Trade of all this Coast. The River of <HI>Chirique</HI> is seldom without Shipping, which bring Trade to it from the City of <HI>Panama</HI> and other places in the Country. It is said to be very well people with <HI>Spaniards, Mul∣lattoes, Mostese</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> And in the Woods is said to be plenty of Beeves, Deer, and wild Hogs. The most noted Island in this Bay, is the Island of <HI>Montu∣osa.</HI> This Island is round and high, and near it are two Rocks, called the <HI>Ladrones.</HI> They are distant from each other three quarters of a Mile. And at the South end of the Island is a Shoal of Sand, which runs a Mile into the Sea. Further in the Bay are several other Towns, Villages, Rivers and Islands: Particularly the Town of <HI>Puebla Nova</HI> or the New-town; (al∣though now it is of an old standing;) which is three Leagues from the Sea-side up a River of the same Name; in which Ships are said to ride in four fathom VVa∣ter, not above half a Mile from the Town. VVithin the Mouth of this River, on the Lar-board side going in, is a Rock cal∣led
<PB N="137" REF="180"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> <HI>Silva,</HI> from the continual Noise it makes in the Night like Musick. But here Captain <HI>Sawkins,</HI> formerly paid the Piper. For going ashore to take the Town of <HI>Puebla Nova,</HI> he was killed by an Ambus∣cade of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> at which they are very dextrous, and had rather fight so lurking amongst Trees and Bushes, than face their Enemy in open Field; unless they happen to be fifteen or twenty to one; and then they will face you bravely in the open Field. This Coast is famous for Pearl-fishing. For at most of these Islands are built Huts, on purpose for the Fishers, who are <HI>Indians,</HI> and are Servants to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that live upon the Main. Not far from them the Main is woody and full of wild Deer, who are not easily scared. Also here are a great many Tur∣tle, who are very large, fat and sweet. Here are also abundance of Fish, which are extraordinary good.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is the Island of <HI>Quibo.</HI> This Island lies in the Latitude of 7 d. 10 m. North. At it are a great many Turtle: The Island is pretty low, but stored with several sorts of Medicinal Herbs, called by the <HI>Spaniards, Herba Maria.</HI> The Island is all round full of large and tall Trees; and upon it in several places is to be found very good Water. There is good ancho∣ring at this Island in ten and twelve fa∣thom
<PB N="138" REF="181"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Water, not above half a mile from the Shore. At this Island they fell a great deal of Timber, with which they build small Vessels, accounted the best in these Parts.</P>
<P>Off the South-point of this Island, lyeth another Island called <HI>Quicara.</HI> It bears S. S. W. from <HI>Quibo,</HI> distance one league. Between these two Islands is a very good Channel, through which you may pass securely without any danger, and come to an anchor in <HI>Quicara</HI> Road, which ly∣eth in a Bay. On the N. E. part of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bay is pretty deep Water; and in the middle of it cometh a River over-against a Rock, near to which Rock is twenty fa¦thom Water. If you please to go ashore with your Boat to get Wood, Water and Coco-nuts, you must go between the Rock and the Point, which will defend you from the S. S. W. Winds.</P>
<P>On the North-part of the Island o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Quibo,</HI> is the Island <HI>Rancheria,</HI> which is a small but very woody Island; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Trees which grow on it, are said to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very good for Masts, which use the <HI>Spani¦ards</HI> often put them to. There are a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many Islands more hereabouts, with seve¦ral good Ports and Rivers, that you ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enter with a Ship of six hundred Tun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> The Bay is full of Islands, and no dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in any of them but what is visible.

<PB N="139" REF="182"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Coast is all secure; only you will find great and uncertain Currents, occasioned by the many Bays, Islands and Rivers in it. And most of these Islands are very well clo∣thed with tall Trees, and afford very good Water.</P>
<P>From Point <HI>Canales</HI> to Point <HI>Mariato,</HI> the Land makes another Bay; in which are also a great many Islands and Rivers, which have several of them large Sholes stretching from them into the Sea. Be∣tween these two Points is an Island, called the <HI>Govanadore.</HI> On it is said to be good Wood and Water; and here are some <HI>Ne∣groes,</HI> who are Slaves to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that come hither to cut Timber, of which here is good store. This is a small round Island, and hath at its West Point a Shole of Sand, which runneth into the Sea about a Mile.</P>
<P>A little to the Northward of this Island of <HI>Govanadore,</HI> and further into the Bay is another Island, called the <HI>Leones;</HI> in which is good Wood and Water. It is a much larger Island than the Island of <HI>Govana∣dore,</HI> and has a Shole of Sand quite round the East-side of it. There is a Channel between these two Islands; but when you go through, take care that you keep the Lead going, and have a care of the East Point of <HI>Leones</HI> and the West Point of <HI>Go∣vanadore.</HI> Here are a great many other I∣slands,
<PB N="140" REF="183"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Rivers and Rocks; but none of any note, till you come to the Point of <HI>Mariato;</HI> neither is there any, or but very little, Trade here by shipping.</P>
<P>The Point of <HI>Mariato</HI> is high Land; and near it are the Mountains of <HI>Guarco,</HI> which are very high Mountains, and very woody; and amongst these Mountains is the <HI>Moro de Porcos,</HI> or the Mountain of Hogs. It is a high round Hill, as high as any of the Mountains of <HI>Guarco.</HI> There are great store of Hogs which run wild up and down these Mountains; from whence, I suppose, this Mount of <HI>Porcos</HI> took its Name.</P>
<P>From the Point of <HI>Mariato</HI> to the Point of <HI>Higuera,</HI> is eighteen leagues; the Coast running East and West; In all which di∣stance it is clear and good Anchor-ground. Two leagues to the Westward of Point <HI>Hi∣guera,</HI> is the Mount of <HI>Porcos;</HI> and right against it is a fine Bay; at the entrance of which, on the East-side, is a shole of Sand, and in the midst of the shole is a little Rock: Take heed how you come near it. On the other side, at the West Point of the said Bay, is a small Island; near which is the best Anchor-ground; And at the bottom of the Bay, is a River of fresh Water.</P>
<P>From the Point of <HI>Higuera</HI> to <HI>Punta∣mala,</HI> is fourteen leagues. The Coast runs
<PB N="141" REF="184"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> W. S. W. and E. N. E. Between these Points are two Rocks called, the <HI>Two Friars:</HI> You may sail safely between them and the Main Land, or in the Channel between them both, or without them both, accord∣ing as you think fit. Here are several small Rivers of no great note or use; as the Ri∣ver <HI>Cascajales,</HI> the River <HI>Oria,</HI> and several others. Upon <HI>Punta-mala</HI> is a small Vil∣lage of <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> called the <HI>Village of Captain Luis del Gado.</HI> This <HI>Punta-mala</HI> is certainly very justly so na∣med. Do not by any means come near it with your Ship; for it hath an innumera∣ble company of Rocks and Sholes, that stretch out above a league into the Sea. Near this Point are kept a great many Farms of Beeves.</P>
<P>A little to the Northward of this bad Point, is the Island <HI>Guanoes;</HI> which has a very good anchoring-place on the North-East side, next the Main Land, in eighteen fathom water, in a sandy Bay, where you are defended from most VVinds. The I∣sland is not very high, and it is well clo∣thed with many tall Trees; and on it is very good water. Right over against it, on the Main, are several sorts of Provisi∣ons to be had; as Beef, Pork, Bread, Flower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if you are strong enough to take it. And if you have a mind to lay your Ship ashore to clean, the Island <HI>Gua∣noes</HI> is a good place.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="185"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From this Island to the Town of <HI>Nata,</HI> is fourteen Leagues; the Land pretty low by the Sea-side, with several Rivers; but the chief, next to that of <HI>Nata,</HI> is the Ri∣ver of <HI>Saints;</HI> on the Banks of which is situated a Village of the same name, cal∣led by the <HI>Spaniards, Villa de los Santos.</HI> It is a small Village of not above eighteen or twenty Houses, mostly <HI>Indians.</HI> Why it is called the <HI>Village of Saints,</HI> I know not. About seven leagues from this <HI>Vil∣lage of Saints,</HI> is the Town of <HI>Nata;</HI> be∣tween which two places are four or five small Rivers, and abundance of Sholes near the main Land. The Town of <HI>Nata</HI> is a large and well-compacted Town, situ∣ated upon the Banks of a River of the same Name. It has great trade with <HI>Pa∣nama,</HI> selling them Provisions, as Cows, Hogs, Fowls, Maiz, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here are seve∣ral other Towns of note: But though they are as great and populous as <HI>Nata,</HI> yet they have not any of them so many white Men; for the mixt Blood is so spread, that for one White, here are a hundred Blacks and Mullattoes, who are of a yellow co∣lour, between black and white.</P>
<P>From <HI>Nata</HI> the Coast stretches in Moun∣tains and Hills; and the water is so shole, that there is scarce any coming in for a Ship; but if there were, here is never a Port. Although it is high and mountain∣ous
<PB N="143" REF="186"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> in the Country, yet by the water-side the Land is not very high. Between the Town of <HI>Nata</HI> and the Point <HI>de Chaine,</HI> are several Rivers; and behind the Hills is a Valley, called <HI>Sapo;</HI> from whence they fetch Hogs and Fowls for the City of <HI>Pa∣nama,</HI> as they do from most places herea∣bouts. Along this Coast Ships ought to keep two or three Leagues off Shore, or else they will meet with broken Ground and sunk Rocks: But the Coast has ma∣ny fresh-water Rivers full of several sorts of very good Fish, which the <HI>In∣dians</HI> catch and send several Leagues round; Fishing being an Employ pecu∣liar to these <HI>Indians,</HI> though it rewards them but very slenderly, because they pay such great Customs out of it to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT the Point <HI>de Chaine</HI> begins the great Bay of <HI>Panama;</HI> which is the great∣est Sea-port, next <HI>Lima,</HI> of any on the West-side of this great Continent of <HI>Ame∣rica.</HI> It is said to have eight Parish Chur∣ches, thirty small Chappels, and to con∣tain six Thousand and five Hundred Houses, most of them well built of Brick and Stone. It is very well fortified, and walled all round with Stone: The City is governed by a President under the Vice∣roy of <HI>Peru;</HI> it being part of his Territo∣ries. On the back-side of the City, is a very pleasant and fruitful Country. The Land is not very high, but full of small Hills, and fine pleasant Valleys, in which there are several fine Gardens of several sorts of Fruit. This is a place of the greatest Trade of any in the South
<PB N="147" REF="190"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Seas, not excepting even <HI>Lima</HI> the Metro∣polis. For this City has the conveniency of Trade both from the North and South Sea: From the North Sea, it receives all or most of the <HI>European</HI> Goods which are brought by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to <HI>Portobel</HI> or <HI>Carthagena,</HI> or by any other Nation trading on the North-side: And these <HI>European</HI> Goods are from hence by ship∣ping in the South Sea sent to <HI>Guiaquill, Truxillo, Lima, Arica, Coquimbo, Gova∣nadore, Valpirizo</HI> and <HI>Valdivia,</HI> with seve∣ral other noted places; from whence they return back richly laden with the Commo∣dities of these Parts. But now the <HI>French</HI> having a trade amongst them, and supply∣ing them with all <HI>European</HI> Necessaries, it hinders this City mightily; and the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> as far as we could hear, whilst we were in these Parts, had rather have their room than their Company. However the <HI>French</HI> at present make very great and pro∣fitable Voyages; and now that they find the sweet of it, they will be sure, if they can, to settle a firm and lasting Trade here. For, as we have been assured by several <HI>Spanish</HI> Captains whom we took, they have made better than 5000 <HI>per Cent.</HI> of their Goods, one with another. This City stood formerly four Miles to the East∣ward of the place where it now stands; But it being taken and kept a Month by
<PB N="148" REF="191"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Sir <HI>Henry Morgan,</HI> and by misfortune burnt three times since; they thought the place unlucky, and so built it by the Sea∣side where it now stands. It is now much larger, stronger and better built, than it was before. The Port of <HI>Perica</HI> is the Harbour for <HI>Panama;</HI> but distant from it three Miles. For the great ebbing and shoalness of the Water, will not suffer any great Ship to come any nearer than the said Island of <HI>Perica,</HI> which is far out of Command of their Guns at <HI>Pa∣nama:</HI> Therefore shipping may easily be taken out. But although great Ships are forced to lie here, yet small Vessels run through a little Creek close up to the City.</P>
<P>From <HI>Panama</HI> to the Island <HI>Tabago,</HI> is between five and six Leagues, and they bear nearly North and South from each other. This Island of <HI>Tabago,</HI> is in length one league, in breadth about half a league. The Island is high and mountainous, but highest at the South end. It is very well clothed with Trees of several sorts; and on it are several Walks of <HI>Plantains, Bo∣nanoes, Coco-nuts,</HI> &amp;c. which they send to sell at <HI>Panama.</HI> Upon this Island, on the North-side, is a small Village of thatcht Houses, inhabited by <HI>Negroes,</HI> who are Slaves to the Gentlemen at <HI>Panama,</HI> and are kept here on purpose to look after their
<PB N="149" REF="192"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Walks of Fruit. Right against the said small Village is the common anchoring place, in which there is tolerable good anchoring in seventeen or eighteen fa∣thom Water. There are two other small Islands just by it; They are both very well clothed wth Woods; aad on them are some few <HI>Negroes,</HI> as there is upon most or all of these Islands in the Bay of <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>To the South East of these <HI>Islands</HI> is a great range of Islands, called the <HI>Kings Islands;</HI> they are most of them pretty low and pleasant Islands, and very well clo∣thed with tall streight Trees of several sorts. About them are a great many very good anchoring places; and upon most of them is good Wood, Water and Fruit. They are in all about forty in number. On the great Island called the <HI>Kings Island</HI> (which gives name to all the rest) the <HI>Spaniards</HI> build good Vessels, which are commonly counted pretty good Sailers. You must observe, that amongst these Islands you will hardly find much more or less than sixty fathom Water, unless you are very near them. Amongst these I∣slands the Water rises and falls ten foot perpendicular.</P>
<P>From <HI>Panama</HI> to the Island <HI>Chepelio,</HI> is eight Leagues. Upon this Island are some <HI>Mullattoes</HI> and <HI>Negroes,</HI> belonging to the
<PB N="150" REF="193"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Gentlemen of <HI>Panama.</HI> The Island is mostly planted with Rice, as are a great many of the <HI>Kings Islands,</HI> which are about ten Leagues distance from hence. Right against this Island, on the Main, is a large River called <HI>Cheapo;</HI> and seven Leagues up the said River, is a Town of the same Name, which is very plentiful of Provisions.</P>
<P>From <HI>Chepelio</HI> to the Island of <HI>Planta,</HI> is seven leagues. It lies a league from the Main, and the water about it is indiffe∣rently deep; but near the Main it is all a∣long shole water, not above four Foot, though you be a league from the shore.</P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Cape Saint Lorenzo,</HI> is ten leagues. This Cape is low Land, full of Creeks; and near it, is shole water. At this Cape begins the Gulf of St <HI>Micha∣el,</HI> in which are a great many Islands, Ri∣vers and Sholes; although in some places the Water is deep and smooth, and good anchoring. It was up one of these Rivers that we went, designing to take the Town of <HI>Santa Maria;</HI> but were frustrated of our intent: Yet we took an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, which we called <HI>Scuchadero.</HI> It was about three leagues within the Mouth of the Ri∣ver, and situated on the South-side of it. In it we found store of Dunghil-Fowls, Parrots, white and black Beans, Yams, Potatoes, Maiz, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It consisted of about
<PB N="151" REF="194"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> two hundred and fifty Houses; and round about the Town were great Walks of Fruit, as Plantains, Bonanoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is an∣other Town on the North-side of the Ri∣ver, called <HI>Scuchadero,</HI> which Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> mentions in his First Vol. <HI>p.</HI> 195; But this we could not find, and so gave the other Town its name; and from thence returned on board our Ships again, which we left lying at Point <HI>Garachina,</HI> which Point I make to lie in the Latitude of 7 d. 20 m. North. The Tide runs here five Knots and a half <HI>per</HI> hour. It rises and falls three Fathom; and ebbs and flows N. E. and S. W.</P>
<P>From Point <HI>Garachina</HI> to Port <HI>Pinas,</HI> is seven leagues, North and South. The Port of <HI>Pinas</HI> has two small Islands at the Mouth of it; But, if you please, you may sail close by them; for there is no danger; neither is there less than twelve or fourteen Fathom water. At this place is good wooding and watering. The Land is high and very woody, and goes up hol∣low in the middle. It is very full of Pine-Trees, and thence called Port <HI>Pinas.</HI> In some part of this Port, is good anchoring; and in the Port are three Rivers of fresh water; and the Banks of the Rivers are full of tall streight Trees. The Port lies in the Latitude of 7 d. North. Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West, 82 d. 00 m. And a
<PB N="152" REF="195"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> little to the Southward of this Port are five or six small Rocks.</P>
<P>From Port <HI>Pinas</HI> to Port <HI>Quemado,</HI> is twenty-five Leagues. At its Mouth are se∣veral Rocks and Islands; and along this Coast, are several good Harbours. The Land here, is not so high as at Port <HI>Pinas;</HI> but in many places here are very pleasant Walks of Coco-nuts. The Coast is very deep and dangerous in Winter-time. At the bottom of Port <HI>Quemado,</HI> are two Ri∣vers of fresh water; and at the entrance of the Port, both on the North and South side, are several small Islands, or rather Rocks: Keep mid-way between both Points, and you may go in very securely. But this is no very secure Port, and sel∣dom or ever made use of.</P>
<P>A little to the Southward of this Port of <HI>Quemado,</HI> is the Port of <HI>Santa Clara.</HI> Off this Port lie four Rocks; and in the mid∣dle of it is a small River. It is but a bad Port, lying open to the South West and o∣ther Southerly Winds, which in the Win∣ter time blow very hard here. This Port lies in the Latitude of six Degrees North.</P>
<P>From Port St <HI>Clara</HI> to the Bay of Saint <HI>Antonio,</HI> is five leagues, all very low Land, which in the rainy time is covered with water; only the tops of the Trees to be seen. Along the shore are a great many small Islands, Rocks and Sholes; There∣fore,
<PB N="153" REF="196"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> be sure, keep without them; for they are very dangerous. In the little Bay of St <HI>Antonio,</HI> is a small Village, now possest by <HI>Indians,</HI> but formerly built by some <HI>Franciscan</HI> Fryars who were put ashore here by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to convert the <HI>Indi∣ans;</HI> but it being a bad place, often o∣verflown with water, and the <HI>Indians</HI> being very poor, the Friars quitted the Village; of which the <HI>Indians</HI> have now possession. It is but bad going into this Bay, by rea∣son of a great shole of Sand, which runs a great way into the Sea from its North-Point; And when you are in, you lie o∣pen to the South, the South West, and o∣ther westerly Winds.</P>
<P>From this Bay to the River <HI>Sande,</HI> is six leagues; Between which the Land rises in six Mounts, not very high, but at a di∣stance they look like six Islands. They are called the <HI>Anegadas,</HI> and stretch from the Bay of St <HI>Antonio</HI> to the River of <HI>Sande.</HI> This River of <HI>Sande</HI> is a great River; and upon the Banks it is well in∣habited by <HI>Indians,</HI> who are not under the <HI>Spanish</HI> Government. They are very poor; and their Poverty protects them from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> who, if there was any thing to be got, would be sure to croud in a∣mongst them. The Coast all along here is deep, and you may sail close to the shore in 10 and 12 fathom water, clean owsie Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="197"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From the River <HI>Sande</HI> to Cape <HI>Corrien∣tes,</HI> is twelve leagues. Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> is very high Land; and when you are at Sea, it looks like an Island. On the top it hath three Hillocks. It is in the Lati∣tude of 5 d. North. And at the Point of it, lies a small Rock. It is a clear and good Coast, but often subject to Rains.</P>
<P>From hence the Land runs into a great Bay, called the Bay of <HI>Bonaventura;</HI> in which are a great many Rivers, Islands and Sholes. From Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> to the great River of <HI>Bonaventura,</HI> is twenty∣three leagues. In the mid-way is the Island <HI>Palmas,</HI> which is a small woody Island, and hath a Sand on the South East side, stretching from one end of the Island to the other. Whether there be any Springs of fresh water on it, I know not; but ve∣ry probably, if any one stood in great need of water, he might find some here; For the Rains fall very plentifully here; So that in the Valleys and Holes there can hardly be any want of Water. This Island lies in the Latitude of 4 d. 15 m. N. and we reckoned Longitude from <HI>London</HI> W. to be 77 d. 10 m.</P>
<P>From the River of <HI>Bonaventura</HI> to the Island <HI>Gorgonia,</HI> is twenty-five leagues, S. W. Between which are a great many small Rivers, at whose Heads the <HI>Spaniards</HI> wait for Gold, which washes down from
<PB N="155" REF="198"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> the great high Mountains near them. The Island <HI>Gorgonia,</HI> is in the Latitude of 3 d. North. The Island is pretty high, and very remarkable for its two Saddles, or risings and fallings on its top. It is a very woody Island, producing tall and large Trees; and on it are several Springs of very good water. The anchoring-place is at the West-end of the Island in a sandy Bay, but the water is pretty deep. It is a∣bout 6 Miles in length, and 4 in breadth: And at both the East and West ends, is a small Island, which looks white, occasio∣ned by the Dung of several sorts of Sea-Fowls, which resort about them. That at the East end, is called <HI>Flaminio;</HI> and the other at the West end, near the anchoring-place, is called the <HI>Isletta.</HI> The Coast near the Water-side, on the Main, is low Land, (although very high within the Country:) and here are some Rivers, that are shole for two leagues into the Sea. Therefore keep off Shore; For if it be flowing water, the Currents will heave you ashore.</P>
<P>From the Island <HI>Gorgonia</HI> to the Island <HI>Gallo,</HI> is twenty-five Leagues. This Island lies in a deep <HI>Ensenada,</HI> or Bay. Off the Island you will find not above four or five Fathom water; but at <HI>Segnetta,</HI> which is on the N. E. side, you may ride safe in deep Water, and free from any danger.
<PB N="156" REF="199"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> This Island is pretty high, and well pro∣vided with good Wood, and several Springs of very good fresh water. Here are also se∣veral brave sandy Bays, at which one may clean a Ship; as we did ours. The water is pretty shole almost all round the Island; and at both the North and South Point are several Rocks, some of which look like a Barn, others like Ships under sail. It lies in the Latitude of 2 d. 45 m. N. and Longitude West from <HI>London</HI> 76 d. 38 m. and we found variation 4 d. VVesterly.</P>
<P>To the North East, on the main Land, distant three leagues, is a large River, cal∣led the River of <HI>Tomaco;</HI> and about a league and a half within the River, is a Town of the same Name. This is a small <HI>Indian</HI> Town, the Inhabitants of which commonly supply small Vessels with Pro∣visions, when they happen to come in here, as they often do, for refresh∣ment. At this River begins a great Wood of Trees, which extends ten or twelve Leagues to the Southward. If you stand in need, this VVood may be very useful to you in making Masts or other∣ways. All along this Coast are many Ri∣vers, at whose Heads both the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> wait for Gold, which washes down from the Mountains. This is a very rainy place, but especially from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>October,</HI> which is the VVinter-time here:
<PB N="157" REF="200"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> At which time, from hence all Northward along the Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> you have con∣tinual Thunder, Lightning and Rain, with many hard Tornadoes. Your Land-marks here are, that the Land is higher than the Coast of <HI>Gorgonia,</HI> and is very full of Hills and Trees; And particularly it has One very high Mount.</P>
<P>From the Island <HI>Gallo</HI> to Point <HI>Man∣glares,</HI> is twelve Leagues. The Coast runs N. N. E. and S. S. W. And between them is a little Island, or rather Rock, called <HI>Gorgonilla.</HI> From the Point of <HI>Manglares</HI> are several Rocks and Shoals, which stretch out two Leagues into the Sea: Otherwise all the Coast is clear and deep, and good Anchor-ground. Whilst we were here, we found a strong Current set∣ting to the North, but whether it be al∣ways so, I know not. From this Point begins a deep Bay called the <HI>Ancon</HI> of <HI>Sardinas.</HI> It is about ten Leagues over; and in the Bay are a great many Sands; and it is shoal a great way off; so that it is ill venturing in with your Ship. Close by the Sea-side it is all low Land, full of small Rivers, whose Banks are very well∣peopled with <HI>Indians.</HI> The Water of these Rivers is very white, and both smells and tastes very strong of Musk, oc∣casioned by the many <HI>Alligators</HI> which are in them. At the South end of this Bay be∣gins
<PB N="158" REF="201"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> the high Land; and the Coast stret∣ches away to the W. S. W. till you come to the Cape of St. <HI>Francisco.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Ancon</HI> of <HI>Sardinas</HI> to the Ri∣ver of St <HI>Jago,</HI> is six Leagues. All along the shore is full of white Clifts; and near the Land the Water is shole. This River of St <HI>Jago,</HI> is a very great River; yet Ships enter but very seldom, though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a small Village 3 Leagues up, and the Banks of it are all along well inhabited by <HI>Indians,</HI> who have several Plantations of Maiz, with Walks of Fruits, and Pens for Cattle, to wit, Beeves and Hogs; of which here is good store. At the Mouth of the River they say is four fathom Water: If you would enter, keep nearest to the South East side; and when you are over the Bar, there is very deep Water; It is a Mile broad, and the high∣est Land on all the Coast, except St <HI>Matheo,</HI> which is seven Leages from it. This River lies in the Latit. of 1 d. 15 m. North; Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West 76 d. 20 m.</P>
<P>From this River to the Bay of St <HI>Ma∣theo,</HI> is seven Leagues. This Bay is very high Land, and has a great many shoals running from it two Leagues into the Sea; and for three or four Leagues the Water is shole, not above four, five, or six fa∣thom. Both to the Northward and South∣ward
<PB N="159" REF="202"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> by the Sea-side, the Land is all white Cliffs. The Bay lies just in the middle of them. In the bottom of the Bay are two Rivers of fresh, but Alliga∣tor-water, that is to say, white musky Water. On each side of the Mouth of these Rivers, are shoals of Sand; and near the Rivers Mouths are very pleasant Rows of fine green Trees; which is the mark to know the Rivers by: For the Mouths of them are so narrow, that at a distance you cannot perceive them.</P>
<P>From this Bay of St <HI>Matheo</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Tacames,</HI> is seven Leagues. This <HI>Ta∣cames</HI> is lower Land than the Bay of St <HI>Matheo;</HI> and at its entrance, between two Sholes, is a small Island. You may anchor in any part of the Port, to wind∣ward; and the nearer shore, the better anchorage and the deeper Water. Here you may wood and water. In this Port were taken by <HI>Don Beltram</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> a few stragling <HI>English</HI> Men: He came hi∣ther unawares, and took them as they were wooding and watering a small Ves∣sel. Off the two Points of this Bay, run two dangerous sholes right off from the shore, for near a League and half; but between them both is pretty deep Water; and the Southermost of the said two sholes stretches away along shore for 3 Leagues, to the Point of <HI>Gallera.</HI> The Coast here
<PB N="160" REF="203"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> runs E. N. E. and W. S. W. to Cape St <HI>Francisco.</HI></P>
<P>The Point of <HI>Gallera</HI> is a low Point; and off it lie many Rocks and Sholes. You may know the Point by this, that there are two white Cliffs upon it, near the Water-side.</P>
<P>From Point <HI>Gallera</HI> to Cape St <HI>Francis∣co,</HI> is two Leagues. It is a high Cape, but far higher within Land than near the Water-side. VVhen you are North or South from it, it looks like three Capes. It is a woody mountainous Land, and has several white Cliffs. This Cape is famous for the rich Prize, named the <HI>Cacafogo,</HI> taken just off it by Sir <HI>Francis Drake:</HI> in which was said to be eighty Pound-weight of refined Gold, twenty-six Tuns of Silver, with a considerable quantity of Jewels. VVe took off this Cape two <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships; one of 120 Tuns, laden with VVine, Brandy, Sugar, Marmalett, Flower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the other about sixty Tuns, laden with Pitch, Tar and Cordage. This Cape St <HI>Francisco,</HI> lies in the Latitude of 1 d. North, and Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West, 81 d. 50 m. and we found here 3 d. 57 m. westerly variation.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That from this Cape of <HI>St Fran∣cisco,</HI> to the South-part of the Great Island of <HI>California</HI> in the Latitude of 23 d. 30 m. from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>November,</HI> is the dirty
<PB N="161" REF="204"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> fainy Season, with hard storms of Wind, and prodigious Flashes of Lightning, and terrible Claps of Thunder; which are at the worst in <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>August.</HI> Also between the aforesaid places, all the Coast is full of Worms; and therefore very in∣convenient for a single Ship, as we were. But to the Southward of this Cape, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> constantly affirm there are no Worms: For those Ships which trade on∣ly on the Coast of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> and never go to Northward of this Cape, are never Worm-eaten. This Cape is, as I may say, the bounds of the rainy and bad Weather; it seldom reaching to the Southward of it, unless by chance, per∣haps not one Year in twenty. I have once heard that the Rains came up as high as <HI>Paita,</HI> which lies in the Latitude of 5 d. 15 m. S. and is 6 d. 15 m. to the South∣ward of this Cape of St <HI>Francisco:</HI> But this was but by chance; and I never heard from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that ever it went so high up, excepting that one time, in any of their Memories.</P>
<P>This Cape of St <HI>Francisco</HI> hath, at the pitch of it, a small Rock. The Coast here, runs away more to the South East∣ward. About three Leagues distance from the Cape is a small Port, called <HI>Apottete;</HI> near which, is a round Hill, behind which is good Wood and Water; and near it, is
<PB N="162" REF="205"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> very smooth landing. It hath two white Clifts; and at the Head of it, is good An∣chor-ground. Sometimes, though seldom, here springs a fresh Gale of Wind from the shore, which may drive you from your Anchors if you be not careful.</P>
<P>From <HI>Appottete</HI> to the first River of <HI>Cogimes,</HI> is three Leagues. There are three Rivers of this Name, and they lie close one by the other. They are all full of sholes in most places, stretching a League and more from the shore into the Sea: Wherefore if you be two Leagues from the shore, you will do well to keep sound∣ing. But to windward of the said three Rivers, you may come nearer the Land: Yet it is all along not very deep to <HI>Coaque.</HI></P>
<P>A little to the Southward of the Sou∣thermost of these three Rivers, is a small and barren Island, right against which are the Mountains of <HI>Coaque:</HI> These are very high Mountains, covered with large and tall Trees; at the foot of which is a small Village of <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> called by the Name of St <HI>John's</HI> Village; and near the Village is the River of <HI>Coaque,</HI> which runs a great way up into the Country.</P>
<P>From the River of <HI>Coaque</HI> to Cape <HI>Pas∣sao,</HI> is twelve Leagues. Between which two places is the River of <HI>Sama,</HI> and the
<PB N="163" REF="206"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Bay of <HI>Baciabo.</HI> The River of <HI>Sama</HI> has a Rock and Shoal of Sand just at its en∣trance; and when you are about a Mile further, it divides into two Branches; the one running to the N. E. and the o∣ther to the S. E. but how far either of them runs up, I know not. The Bay of <HI>Baciabo</HI> (which is about a Mile to the Southward of the River of <HI>Sama,</HI>) is a pretty deep Bay: At the bottom of it are a great many white Clifts, which are sup∣posed to lie directly under the Equator. The Bay is rocky all round; and at each of its Points are some very dangerous Sands, which stretch four or five Miles off to the Sea. From hence to the Cape <HI>Pas∣sao,</HI> is about five Leagues: In all which way are many small Points and Bays; most of which are very well clothed with several sorts of Trees, tall and streight, and of various Shapes and Colours. And the Land is of an indifferent height. This Cape <HI>Passao</HI> is a high round Cape, with but few Trees on it. It lies in the Latit. of 00d. 08 m. South, Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West 82 d. 40 m. and we found variation here 3 d. 33 m. Westerly. At the Pitch of the Cape are two Rocks, both of them visible above Water; and within the Cape the Land is pretty high and mountainous, and very woody. If you want to anchor near the Cape, you must
<PB N="164" REF="207"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> go to the S. W. over against a small Town, where you may ride securely from the South Winds, in eight fathom Water. Observe that you come not too near the Cape; for it has some rocky Ground that lies near it. The Cape, as I said before, is full of round Hills; and in the North∣part of it, is a sort of Water, which we call half-wholesome, because it is brackish and tastes as if fresh Water and Salt were mix∣ed together. This Water issues from a Rock, which lies a Stones-cast from the VVater-side, to the left Hand of the land∣ing place.</P>
<P>A little to the Southward of the said Cape, is a small River; from which to the Bay of <HI>Caracas,</HI> is three Leagues. This is a pretty deep Bay, and at the bottom of the Bay is a River, called the River of <HI>Charapoto,</HI> which is said to run a great way up in the Country. In the middle of the Bay, is the common anchoring place; and on the South-side, right-against the said anchoring place, is a small Village called the Village of <HI>Charapoto.</HI> In it are not above eight or nine Houses, mostly built of Palmeto-leaves, and inhabited by <HI>Indian</HI> Fishermen, who have little or no other Food but Fish. These People are very poor, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have lit∣tle or no converse with them for that reason. In the middle, at the entrance
<PB N="165" REF="208"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> of the Bay, is a small Island of an indiffe∣rent height, very well clothed with Trees; and from the North-point of this Island to the North point of the Bay, runneth a shole clear over, so that there is no go∣ing over with a Ship: But on the South∣side of the Island, between it and the Main, you may safely venture; for there is no danger. The Coast here runs N. E. and S. VV.</P>
<P>From the Bay of <HI>Caracas</HI> to the Port of <HI>Manta,</HI> is seven Leagues; and they bear from each other N. E. and S. VV. Be∣tween them are several Points, stretching out into the Sea; and between these Points are several sandy Bays. The Land is of an indifferent height, and very full of Trees. Right off the Port of <HI>Manta,</HI> almost in the middle, just at the entrance, is a Rock or small Island, which but just appears above VVater. This Port of <HI>Manta</HI> is a small Port; but in it you are defended from the South VVest and other Southerly VVinds, which are the com∣mon VVinds upon this Coast. For from Cape <HI>Passao</HI> in the Latitude of 00d. 08 m. South, to and beyond Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> in the Latitude of 3 d. 45 m. South, there is seldom or never any Land-wind. VVhich is very observable; because it is so contrary to all the rest of the Coast. For upon all the rest of the Coast, you have common
<PB N="166" REF="209"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Land and Sea-winds, each as duly succeed∣ing the other, as the Night the Day; the Land-winds being commonly right off the shore, and the Sea-winds from the South, blowing within a Point or two along the shore. In the Port of <HI>Manta</HI> is a small <HI>Indian</HI> Village, said to be formerly a Habitation of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> in which they built a Church, that is still standing. The best anchoring is over-against it; where you may anchor in seven or eight fathom Wa∣ter, good fast Ground. The Land here∣abouts is very barren, producing only a few shrubby Trees, and some small Bush∣es. The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had formerly possession of this place, live now seven Leagues within Land; where they have built them a large Town, called by the same Name. The other Land-marks of this place are, that on the North-part the Land is of an indifferent height, and <HI>Monte Christo</HI> looks like a Sugar-loaf; from whence you will see the Land run plain to the top of the Cape of St <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and is of an indifferent height: Also a little to the Westward of the said Port, is a shole of Quick-sand, which lies under Water, and the Sea never breaks upon it. Many a good Ship has been cast away up∣on it.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the Southward of this Port, is a little Rock, pretty high above
<PB N="167" REF="210"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> the Water; from which Rock to the Cape of St <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> is three leagues. Half a league before you come to the Cape, is a good anchoring place; where, if you want fresh water, you may supply your self. All the Coast is deep and clear; and you may ride in any part of the Cape of <HI>Saint Lo∣renzo.</HI> The Cape is highest near the wa∣ter side. On it are only a few Trees and Bushes. Right against it are two Rocks, which look like two Friars, and are so cal∣led. The one is high and slender, and the other looks very bluff. When you are off at Sea, the Cape, bearing North, and distant about four or five leagues, shows plain above; and you may see the top of a Steeple of a Church or Chapel. This Cape I make to lie in the Latitude of 01 d. South. Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West 82 d. 15 m. and we found variation 3 d. 09 m. Westerly. A little Southward of the Cape, lies a shole of Sand, which stretches out to Sea from the Main about a league, and is in breadth about half a league.</P>
<P>From Cape St <HI>Lorenzo</HI> to the Island <HI>Pla∣ta,</HI> is five leagues; and they bear from each other E. N. E. and W. S. VV. This Island is so called from the great quantity of Plate which was shared here by Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> and his Company. It lies in the Latitude of 01 d. 10 m. South. It is in length about a league, and in breadth
<PB N="168" REF="211"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> about half a league. It is of an indifferent height, but highest at the East end. There are upon it some few small Trees, but not fit for any use. There are several Rocks and Sholes at both Points of the Island, which stretch out into the Sea near a mile; and the Sea often breaks upon them: And at the South East end are three small and steep Rocks. It is deep water all round, except at the two aforesaid Points; and the anchoring place is on the East side, in a sandy Bay, where is good anchor ground and smooth water; For in it you are de∣fended from the Southerly VVinds, which are common VVinds off this Coast. VVhe∣ther there be any water upon the Island, I know not; but at some certain times of the Year, here are said to be plenty of Sea-Turtle.</P>
<P>From the Island <HI>Plata</HI> to the Island <HI>Sa∣longo,</HI> is six leagues. This Island is higher Land than the Island <HI>Plata.</HI> It hath two small Rocks, which are pretty high; the one at the South, the other at the North end of it. At this Island is a pretry good place to ride in, on the East side, next to the Main Land; and there is a parcel of white broken Ground a little to the South∣ward of the anchoring place.</P>
<P>Right against this Island, on the main Land, is the Bay of <HI>Picoya;</HI> at the North side of which is a small anchoring-place;
<PB N="169" REF="212"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> and on both sides of the Bay are sholes of Sand; but in the middle the water is deep enough: Therefore it is best keeping an equal distance between both Shores; and with that precaution, One may venture in with safety. In going in, you will pass by three small Rocks. Come not too near them, for they are shole half a mile round. At the bottom of the Bay is the River <HI>Picoya,</HI> about three leagues up which, live <HI>Indian</HI> People, who supply the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with many Necessaries.</P>
<P>To the South-Eastward of this River and Bay of <HI>Picoya,</HI> distant about two leagues, are two small Rocks, called <HI>Aho∣reados</HI> or the Hang'd-men. Because <HI>Ma∣chiaco</HI> the Tyrant, an <HI>Indian</HI> King, in a Battle he had with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> took two of them Prisoners, which he caused to be hanged, one upon each of these Rocks.</P>
<P>From these 2 Rocks, a little to the South∣ward, is the River of <HI>Colanche.</HI> It is a fresh-water River; and in it is said to be four or five fathom water, good Anchor∣ground. The Inhabitants, who are <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> carry water to the Town of <HI>St Helle∣na,</HI> wherewith they supply that Town. Right against the River, but a good di∣stance from it, is the Island <HI>Colanche.</HI> This Island is said to be extraordinarily healthy; and on it are some few <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitants,
<PB N="170" REF="213"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> who spend most of their time in fishing; here being pretty good store of Fish, with which they partly supply the Town of <HI>St Hellena</HI> just by. All round the Island is ten fathom water, close to the shore; so that you may go from one part to another, very securely.</P>
<P>From the River <HI>Colanche</HI> to the Town of <HI>St Hellena,</HI> is four leagues. This is a small Town, consisting of <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians:</HI> They have commonly in it some store of Provisions, as Biscuit, Pease, Flow∣er, Corn, dryed Fish, salted Beef, Pork, and other Necessaries, with which they supply such Ships as arrive here. The best anchoring is in about seven or eight fathom water, a little to the South West of the Town. The Land is here very low and barren, having no Trees; and so stretches away to the Point of St <HI>Hellena.</HI> This Point is high Land, and very even at the top. It lies in the Latitude of about 2 d. 20 m. South. At a distance it appears like an Island, because the Land about it is low; and it bulges out into the Sea, directly to the West. Over-against the Point, on the North-side, there is a Bay, and if you fall in there in the Night, keep your Lead going, and mind your Depth, till you can either get out, or with conve∣niency come to an anchor.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="214"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> The Point St <HI>Hellena</HI> makes the North point of the Bay of <HI>Guiaquill,</HI> as Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> does the South. It is a great Bay, in which are some Islands, many Rivers, and abundance of Sholes.</P>
<P>From Point <HI>St Hellena</HI> to the Point of <HI>Chandy,</HI> is about five leagues. Off this Point lye several dangerous Sholes; there∣fore great care must be taken of coming near it.</P>
<P>From the Point of <HI>Chandy</HI> to the Island St <HI>Clara,</HI> is seven Leagues, North and South. Between which two places are a great many dangerous Sholes; and there is no going between the Island St <HI>Clara</HI> and the Island of <HI>Puna.</HI> For all along on the East-side of the Island St <HI>Clara,</HI> and on the West side of the Island <HI>Puna,</HI> are a great many Sholes, which stretch from one Island to the other. The Island St <HI>Clara,</HI> which is the first Island at going into this Bay, is an indifferent high Island, pretty well clothed with small Trees. It resem∣bles a Corps in a Shroud; the East end representing the Head, and the West the Feet.</P>
<P>Between this Island and Cape <HI>Blanco,</HI> which is about twenty four or twenty five Leagues distant, is the Channel for Ships; who keep to the Southward of the Island, and a good distance from the Point of <HI>Pu∣na,</HI> and steer away East, till they have
<PB N="170" REF="215"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> past the Island <HI>Puna.</HI> They have in the Channel, going in, from thirty to twenty fathom Water; and when they are come up with the S. E. Point of the Island <HI>Puna,</HI> then the River turns away to the North, and grows narrower and narrower, to the Town of <HI>Guiaquill;</HI> and the Land all along by the sides of it, is low swampy Land, over grown with small Mangrove-Trees.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Guiaquil</HI> is a large Town, said to contain near five thousand Inhabi∣tants. In it are several fine Churches and other good Buildings. It is situated on the lower part of a declining Hill, so that the Houses near the Water side are often overflown. It is pretty well fortified, having two Forts, one standing upon the Hill, and the other in a Vally near the South end of the Town. It is the third greatest place of Trade on the Coast of <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>From the Town of <HI>Guiaquil</HI> to the Island <HI>Puna,</HI> is seven Leagues. This is a low I∣sland, in many places overflown. It is about thirteen Leagues long, and five broad. At the Point of <HI>Arena</HI> is the com∣mon anchoring place for Ships, till they get a Pilot to carry them close up to the Town of <HI>Guiaquil.</HI> This Point <HI>Arena</HI> is a very low Point, from whence to Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> is twenty eight Leagues. All along
<PB N="171" REF="216"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> upon the main Land, it is very full of Sholes, which stretch from the Main into the Sea above two Leagues; and the great Rivers that run out from the Land, aug∣ment them. Here is all along a great row or Wood of Trees, and amongst the Trees is the River of <HI>Tumbes;</HI> upon the Banks of which are fed store of Cattle. It is a passage for Travellers, there being a great Road from it, to several In-land Towns and Villages.</P>
<P>From the River <HI>Tumbes</HI> to <HI>Mancora,</HI> is fourteen leagues, a clear Coast; and from thence to Cape <HI>Blanco,</HI> four leagues. This Cape is high Land; and from it blow such boisterous Winds, that it is a common Pro∣verb with the <HI>Spaniards, that the Stoutest Man of War must strike to Cape Blanco.</HI> Yet here is never any great Sea. This Cape I make to lye in the Latitude of 3 d. 45 m. <HI>S.</HI> Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West, 81 d. 50 m; and we found Variation 2 d. 52 m. Westerly.</P>
<P>From Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> to Point <HI>Parina,</HI> is seven Leagues. In the Mid-way is a small Bay and Port, called <HI>Malaca.</HI> It is very seldom made use of; and at its South Point is a great Shole, which runs out to the N. W. into the Sea above a Mile: Therefore in going in, it is best to keep nearest the North shore, to avoid this Shole. Be∣tween this Shole and the Point of <HI>Parina,</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="217"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> are several little Bays, but of no use. And excepting the Shole near the Point of <HI>Malaca,</HI> all is deep and clear; so that you may ride where you please; only you must mind that your Ground-tackling be good, because of the hard Gusts of Wind which often blow here. The Point of <HI>Parina</HI> is low Land towards the Sea side, and at a distance it appears like two Islands, one of which looks round, and the other cragged, as if it was cut in Pieces; and to Leeward of the Point, is a fine little Bay.</P>
<P>Upon the Coast of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> from the Island <HI>La Moucha</HI> in the Latitude of 38 d. 30 m. <HI>S.</HI> to the Point of <HI>Garachina</HI> in the Latitude of 7 d. 20. N. the Wind is always Southerly, two Points upon the shore. Thus when the Coast runs North and South, the Wind will be at S. S. W. When the Coast runs S. S. E. the Wind will be at South, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Except it be in the Night; and then the Sea-wind commonly ceases, and there comes a fine and mode∣rate Gale from the Land.</P>
<P>From the Point of <HI>Parina</HI> to the Port of <HI>Paita,</HI> is seven leagues: Between which two places is the River of <HI>Colan.</HI> At the Mouth of this River are two Sands, one on each side, stretching about a Mile to∣wards the Sea; and in the middle of these two Sholes is the Channel, which is pretty
<PB N="175" REF="218"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> deep. Up this River are many <HI>Indian</HI> Towns and Villages. The Country here∣about is very mountainous and barren; but the Valleys are said to be very Fruit∣ful, as they are all along to the Southward upon this Coast. The highest Mountains here, are the Mountains of <HI>Motapa,</HI> which are also barren, and have many Pieces of broken ground on them; but at the top in two or three places the Land is pretty even, and looks like Tables. In this Bay you have the Land and Sea-winds con∣stant. The Sea-wind is commonly at South and S. by W. which begins about nine in the morning, and holds commonly till nine or ten at Night; then this Wind dyes away, and about half an hour, or an hour after, the Land-wind springs up, which is commonly at East right off the Land, and continues a fine fresh Gale till about eight in the morning; Then it falls calm, and soon after springs up the Sea-wind, as before. Up the River of <HI>Colan,</HI> is a Town of the same Name. The <HI>Indians</HI> of this Town come down commonly with the Land∣wind to <HI>Paita</HI> in Boats, and bring fresh water to supply the Town of <HI>Paita</HI> and the Shipping that be there: For they have no fresh water at <HI>Paita.</HI> They also bring them Wood and other Necessaries; And when the Sea-wind blows, the <HI>Indians</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="219"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> with their Boats return again to <HI>Colan.</HI> In <HI>Paita</HI> Bay is very good Anchor-Ground from twenty-five to six fathom Wa∣ter. As you draw nearer the Town, the water grows shole gradually. It is a fine large Bay, capable to contain near a hun∣dred Sail of Ships. It is all over sandy Ground; and in it you are defended from the South West, and other Southerly winds, by a Point of Land which runs out between the Bay and the Sea; so that Ships riding within this Point, lie always in as smooth water, and as safe as if they were in a Pond. It is in the Latitude of 5 d. 15 m. South: And we found variation here 2 d. 37 m. Westerly. Within this Point is the Town of <HI>Paita;</HI> which is a pretty little Town, consisting of about eighty Houses, most of them <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Although it is a place of no great Trade, yet it is seldom without shipping, because it lies so very convenient for all Ships going up or down; And it is very seldom that any Ship passes by, without putting in here for Refresh∣ments, of which this Town is well suppli∣ed by those of <HI>Colan.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Paita</HI> upwards, the Coast runs W. S. W. two leagues, to <HI>Pena Oradada,</HI> or Golden Rock; from whence to the Nor∣thermost Island of <HI>Lobos,</HI> called <HI>Lobos de Terra,</HI> is two leagues more; and they bear from each other North East and South
<PB N="177" REF="220"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> West. This Island <HI>Lobos,</HI> has a Shole and a great hollow Rock at the North end of it, which stretches out near half a Mile into the Sea. The Anchoring-place is at the North East end in four and five fa∣thom water. The Island is of an indiffe∣rent height, and is so like to <HI>Lobos de la Mar,</HI> that though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are very well acquainted here, yet they often mi∣stake the one for the other. It is a very rocky Island, not producing any thing; and on it is no fresh water. Of Sea-Fowl, here are Boobies, Noddies, Penguins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And of Fishes, here are Sea-Lions and Seals in abundance.</P>
<P>From this Island to the Point of <HI>Paita,</HI> is fifteen leagues North and South. And between this Island and the foresaid Point, is the Bay of <HI>Sechura,</HI> a league from <HI>Lobos de Terra.</HI> Upon the main Land is the <HI>Chair of Paita:</HI> It is high Land towards the Sea-side; so that there is none like it between it and Cape <HI>Blanco.</HI> The Coast here runs East North East, and South South West.</P>
<P>A little to the South East, is the Port of <HI>Monura,</HI> which is said to be almost as good a Port as that of <HI>Paita.</HI> There is very good fresh water to be had, with a∣bundance of several sorts of very good fish. It is said to lie in the Latitude of
<PB N="178" REF="221"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> 6 d. South. The land hereabouts is all mountainous and barren.</P>
<P>From the Windward Point of this Port of <HI>Monura</HI> to the Island of <HI>Lobos de la Mar,</HI> is seven leagues. This Island lyes in the Latitude of 6 d. 20 m. South. Here is commonly a great Sea the whole Year through, and the currents set along shore to Leeward. Here <HI>Paulo Andrea</HI> and <HI>James Querba,</HI> two <HI>Spanish</HI> Captains, were cast away. It is dangerous coming near this Island, by reason of the many Currents which always run here. The Island is not above two leagues round. The Harbour is towards the N. E. part; whose passage is very narrow; but it is indifferent safe going in, to those that are any thing ac∣quainted with it; and within the entrance is a good Port, to lye and refit or clean a Ship in: But here is no fresh Water; and it is so barren, that it does not produce any Trees or Bushes. Here are abundance of Seals and Sea-Lions, and several sort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of very good Fish.</P>
<P>From the Island <HI>Lobos de la Mar,</HI> to the Mount of <HI>Etem,</HI> is five leagues. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a high Hill, and appears round. From which place the Coast falleth away lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the Sea-side, to the Port of <HI>Chiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> Yet up in the Country the Land is ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> high and mountainous.

<P><PB N="179" REF="222"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> A little to the Southward is the Port of <HI>Pacasmayo.</HI> In this Port is a Rock, which is hollow, and which commonly has a∣bundance of white Birds about it. Here is fresh Water, but the Spring is said to be three quarters of a Mile from the Sea; whence they carry Water to <HI>Chiripi.</HI> This Port of <HI>Pacasmayo</HI> is a brave Port. It lies in the Latitude of 7 d. 20 m. South; and the anchoring place is on the Weather-side of the Port, near the Mount of <HI>Malabrigo.</HI> Here are said to be abundance of Water-Rats, which often do great damage to Ships Cables.</P>
<P>Not far off, is the Port of <HI>Malabrigo;</HI> and near the Port is a Mountain cal∣led by the same Name. It is a high Mountain, and at the top of it is some broken Ground. Near it you may per∣ceive the Breasts of <HI>Chicama,</HI> which stand above the Town of <HI>Pisan:</HI> These are the Marks for the Port of <HI>Malabrgo.</HI> There is also, to know the Port by, not above two leagues from the Main, a small Rock, called the Rock of <HI>Malabrigio.</HI> This Rock at a distance looks as if it was cut in two in the middle, and it lies in the Latitude of 8 d. South. The best place to anchor in, is to Leeward of the Mountain of <HI>Ma∣labrigo,</HI> bringing it to bear due South; and there is no less than fifty fathom Wa∣ter good fast Anchor-ground.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="223"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> The Rock of <HI>Malabrigo</HI> bears with the Port of <HI>Guanchaco,</HI> alias <HI>Truxillo,</HI> South East. And between these two places is the Bay of <HI>Chicama:</HI> At the bottom of which Bay is the River of <HI>Chicama;</HI> the Banks of which are well inhabited by <HI>In∣dians.</HI> Hereabouts is commonly a strong Current, setting into the Bay of <HI>Chicama,</HI> and to the Northward withall. On the North-side of the River of <HI>Chicama,</HI> is a small Village of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> called the Vil∣lage <HI>de Chao.</HI></P>
<P>Hence a little to the Southward is the Port of <HI>Guanchaco,</HI> which is the Harbour for <HI>Truxillo.</HI> In this Port are two sholes of Sand pretty near the shore, but the anchoring place is without them. It is but a bad Port, and without defence, being exposed to all Winds. In it there runs so great a Sea upon the shore, that very often for three or four Days neither can any Boats go ashore nor come from the shore; yet this is a place of great Trade. Near the Water-side is the Town of <HI>Guanchaquo,</HI> which is a small fishing Town; and about six Miles with∣in Land, is the City of <HI>Truxillo,</HI> which is a large City, and mostly inhabited by <HI>Spaniards.</HI> It hath a great Trade for Flower, Brandy, Sugar, Wine and Mar∣malett; of which they export three or four Ship-loads every Year, with which
<PB N="181" REF="224"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> they supply the City of <HI>Panama. Guan∣chaquo</HI> is the Port by which they export all these Goods. And it lies in the Latitude of 8 d. 15 m. South.</P>
<P>From hence not far to the S. E. is the Mountain of <HI>Guanapi,</HI> a high Moun∣tain, and which the Sea falls very heavy upon. To Leeward of this Mountain a∣bout a Mile, is a little Island which runs out about a league; and near to that Island is a Rock, which is high and round, and when you are at a distance from it, it looks whitish. This Rock of <HI>Guanapi</HI> and the Island of <HI>Saints,</HI> are distant from each o∣ther nine leagues, bearing N. W. and S. E. Between them are two more Islands, one of which is called the Island of <HI>Clao.</HI> Four leagues before you come to this Island, it is somewhat dangerous; and by that time you begin to draw pretty near the sholes, you will see two little Rocks, one bigger than the other; which Rocks are right-against a small Bay, in which is a good Port, defended from the South-winds; but here is no fresh Water, but what is fetched from a Town three Miles off. From this Bay towards the S. E. is another Rock, near unto the Main-land: Off which Rock is a shole, about three Cables length from it; And more to the South∣ward is the Rock of <HI>Santa,</HI> distant about a league and a half. Near this Rock is a
<PB N="182" REF="225"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Port called <HI>Santa;</HI> and in entering into this Port, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> commonly look out for a spot of Land, which is very plain; and looks like a Path-way; When they see that Spot or Path-way, they run in boldly; and in the Road they have not above 4 or 5 fathom Water. At this place at a small Village a little within Land, called the Village of <HI>Orsa,</HI> and inhabited by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is commonly store of Biscuit, Wood, VVater and other Necessaries to be had. In the Channel between the Island and the Main, any Ship may go, keeping nearer to the Island than the Main: And it is good to keep a pretty distance from the little Island, which lies near the Land; for there is foul rocky Ground. The I∣sland of <HI>Saints,</HI> is a league in length: It is white Ground, and has three broken Places, one of which looks as if it were cut in two in the middle. On the South-part of it, is a little Island, at which there is good anchoring; and it lies in the Lati∣tude of 9 d. South.</P>
<P>From this Island to the Port of <HI>Cosma,</HI> is ten leagues. The Coast runs N. N. VV. and S. S. E. At the South point of this Port is a little Rock, and a small shole of Sand all round it; and within on the same side, is a River of fresh Water; at the Mouth of which, is the common an∣choring place; and at the North point
<PB N="183" REF="226"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> coming in, is a small low Island, but higher at both ends than in the middle. This <HI>Cosma</HI> is a very good Port, and in it you are defended from most Winds. It lies in the Latitude of 9 d. 50 m. South, and Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West 78 d. 35 m. In the Mouth or Entry of this Port there is no danger; for all is clear and good Ground. On the South-part of the Port, is a great Mountain, called the Mountain of <HI>Mongon.</HI> A little to the Southward of the South Point of the Port, and about a league from the Mountain of <HI>Mongon,</HI> is a small low and even Island, called the <HI>Isletta;</HI> within which, close in under the Main, are two small Rocks.</P>
<P>From the Port of <HI>Cosma</HI> to <HI>Mongon,</HI> is three leagues; and from <HI>Mongon</HI> to <HI>Mon∣gonilla,</HI> four leagues. This is a small Port, and seldom made use of; yet in it you are defended from the Southerly Winds. From <HI>Mongonilla</HI> to the <HI>Caleta's,</HI> is two leagues. These are two small deep Bays; in both of which is good anchoring. A∣bout a league to the Southward of the Southermost of these, is the Port of <HI>Ver∣mejo:</HI> Right before the Mouth of which, is a small and indifferent high Island, cal∣led the <HI>Isletta.</HI> This Island has a Bay on the East side, called the Bay of <HI>Callibria;</HI> and between the Island and the Port, are some bad sholes. This Port of <HI>Vermejo,</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="227"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> is a very good Port, but not inhabited. There is no fresh Water nearer the Sea side than a Mile.</P>
<P>The Mountain of <HI>Mongon,</HI> which lyes about seven Leagues to the Northward of this Port, is the highest Mountain that is known on all this Coast. It may be seen at a great distance off at Sea; and many times Ships stay a Month or more by it, by reason of the Currents that set to the Northward along the Coast. The best way is to keep off at Sea as much as you can, until you come into the Latitude of <HI>Callau.</HI></P>
<P>From the Port of <HI>Vermejo</HI> to <HI>Guarmey,</HI> is three leagues. <HI>Guarmey</HI> hath a plain spot of Sand; and the Land within is dou∣ble, and hath some spots of Sand on the top of it; and within the Port is a round white Rock, where there is good riding on the Weather side in eight fathom Wa∣ter, good clear fast Ground. In this Port is a River of fresh Water, which runs into the Sea near a parcel of Rocks, where the Ships commonly unlade. It is furnished with Wood, Water and other Necessaries. It lyes in the Latitude of 10 d. 30 m. South: And here the Coast runs away S. S. W. to the Island of <HI>Don Martin.</HI></P>
<P>From the Port of <HI>Guarmey</HI> to <HI>Jaquey of Sarra,</HI> is four leagues. This Peice of the Coast, runs away South: Between these
<PB N="185" REF="228"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> two places is a high Mountain, and over againg it a small Port. From <HI>Jaquey of Sarra</HI> to <HI>Monjala,</HI> is six leagues. This is a little Mountain, which is nothing but a barren Rock; and at a distance to those off at Sea, it appears white, and looks like a Ship under Sail. From <HI>Jaquey of Sarra</HI> to the River <HI>Barancis,</HI> is nine leagues. This is a fresh Water River, and runs a great way up in the Country; the banks of it are very well inhabited with <HI>Indians;</HI> and hereabouts are a great many fields planted with Wheat. From the River <HI>Barancis</HI> to the Port of <HI>Supe,</HI> is two leagues. This is a small Port, and seldom made use of for want of Trade, although in it you are defended from the Southerly Winds. The Land hereabouts is high and mountainous, and the Mountains most of them very barren; but the Valleys are said to be very fruitful. From this small Port of <HI>Supe</HI> to the Island of <HI>Don Martin,</HI> is three Leagues. This is a whitish Island, plain and even, and lyes about three quar∣ters of a Mile off the shore.</P>
<P>From hence to the Port of <HI>Guara,</HI> is one league. This Port lies in the Latitude of 11 d. 02 m. South: And we reckon Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West, 77 d. 10 m. On the windward part of this Port, is a Mountain; on the top of which are some Pyramids. A little to the Northward of
<PB N="186" REF="229"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> this Port, is a small Port, called the Port of <HI>Salinas.</HI> It is the best Port of the two; but they are both something dangerous. At this place is abundance of Beef ready∣salted; of which they send great store both to <HI>Lima</HI> and <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>From the Port of <HI>Guara</HI> to <HI>Tambo,</HI> is four leagues. The Coasts runs N. N. W. and S. S. E. and in the mid-way is a small anchoring-place, called the Port of <HI>Chan∣cay.</HI> It is all clear and good Ground; and this Port of <HI>Chancay</HI> is a very good Port, from whence is transported to <HI>Lima</HI> Wheat and store of other Provisions. In it you ride secure from the South winds. From this Port to the Rocks <HI>Piscadores,</HI> is two leagues. There are several of these Rocks, but the middlemost is the biggest. About these Rocks are abundance of seve∣ral sorts of very good Fish; and upon these small Islands, or rather Rocks, are several <HI>Indian</HI> Huts, inhabited by <HI>Indians,</HI> who are Fishermen; for which reason these Rocks are called the <HI>Piscadores.</HI> Within these Rocks is a fine Port, called the Port of <HI>Anton. de Rodas;</HI> in which is secure riding from most Winds. The Land is pretty high, and the Hills mostly barren.</P>
<P>The Rocks <HI>Piscadores,</HI> lie due North and South with <HI>Callau,</HI> and East North East from the Islands of <HI>Ormigas,</HI> which lie
<PB N="187" REF="230"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> eight leagues from <HI>Callau</HI> right off the shore. The Islands of <HI>Ormigas</HI> are small: On them are several pieces of broken Ground, with several small Bays. About them are abun∣dance of several sorts of very good Fish. The Fishermen come from <HI>Lima</HI> to this place a fishing; and here the <HI>Indians</HI> make abundance of Sea-fish Oyl.</P>
<P>The Island <HI>Callau</HI> is very high and bar∣ren, having neither wood nor fresh water, nor so much as any green thing upon it. It is two leagues long. Upon this Island is the great City of <HI>Lima;</HI> which is the City-Royal for the Empire of <HI>Peru.</HI> It is the Seat of a Vice-Roy and an Archbishop. It is a large City, said to contain 17000 <HI>Spaniards,</HI> besides a far greater number of <HI>Mullattoes, Mostese,</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> In it are said to be twenty-five Parish Churches, all well built, and very rich in Gold and Sil∣ver and precious Stones; The Images of many of their Saints being of massy Gold. It is well fortified, having a Castle of se∣venty Brass Guns, forty-eight Pounders; close under which is the common place of anchoring; and they commonly ride in six fathom water, good fast Ground. The I∣sland is joined to the main Land by a Bridge of Stone; and almost one half of the City is on the other side upon the main Land. It is a place of the greatest Trade of any on the West side of <HI>America;</HI> and
<PB N="188" REF="231"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> the Harbour is never without Shipping. In all this Coast towards the South-seas, it is observable that it seldom rains; yet with the Evening and Morning Dews, the Valleys are said to be as fruitful as any in the whole World: But the Hills are as barren; for few of them produce any thing; nay many not so much as Grass. At this place groweth a famous Occiden∣tal Bezoar, which is found in the Maw of the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep; which Sheep they make use of to carry Burthens. For it is said one of these Sheep will carry 500 pound weight with ease; and that, like a Camel, they will go two or three days without eating or drinking. A little to the Southward of the anchoring-place, and off the Point of <HI>Callau,</HI> is a shole of Sand, which runs a great way into the Sea; and right off the shole is a rocky Island, cal∣led the Island of <HI>Lima.</HI> This Island has several small Rocks about it; but the big∣gest of them lies at the South end: This Rock is called <HI>Pena Oradada,</HI> or the Gol∣den Rock; because a Galeon was lost near it, in which was said to be a very great quantity of Gold. This <HI>Pena Ora∣dada</HI> is very high, and no Ship can pass between these Rocks, or between the Rocks and the Island of <HI>Lima:</HI> But Ships that come from the Southward, steer in between <HI>Pena Oradada</HI> and the Point of
<PB N="189" REF="232"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> <HI>Callau,</HI> till they come to the Island of <HI>Li∣ma;</HI> to avoid the great shole which runs off the Point of <HI>Callau.</HI> And when they have past the Point of <HI>Callau,</HI> they steer directly to the Anchoring-place, and in their way there is no danger. In all this Bay or Port of <HI>Callau,</HI> is secure riding; it being clear and good fast Ground, grow∣ing shallow gradually from twelve to four fathom water; and in it you are defended from the Southerly wind, which is the com∣mon Trade-wind off this Coast. About this Island and among the Rocks, are store of very good Fish; and upon most of them are some Huts, in which are <HI>Indians</HI> who make it their constant employ to fish; which Fish they carry to <HI>Lima</HI> to sell, and then return to catch more. This Port lies in the Latitude of 12 d. 20 m. South.</P>
<P>Four leagues to the Southward of these Rocks, is <HI>Pachacama;</HI> near to which are two round Rocks, one bigger than the o∣ther; and near Them is another parcel of little Rocks, about eight or ten in num∣ber. Here the Land is very high and moun∣tainous, having two or three rows of Hills one within another.</P>
<P>From these Rocks to the Port of <HI>Chilca,</HI> is three leagues. It is a very good Port, and good anchoring. The entry is on the North East side. In this Port is a Rock, called the <HI>Tortois;</HI> and when you are once with∣in
<PB N="190" REF="233"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> that, all is clear, and there is six or se∣ven fathom Water. In this Port they load great Ships with Salt for <HI>Guiaquil.</HI> The Town stands two leagues from the Port, and is inhabited partly by <HI>Spaniards</HI> and partly by <HI>Indians.</HI> It is but a small Town, consisting not of above twenty or twenty∣five Houses, mostly ill built.</P>
<P>From this Port to the Island <HI>Asia,</HI> is two leagues. It is an indifferent high Island, about half a league long, and hath a de∣fense for little Ships: Near it lie two Rocks.</P>
<P>From this Island to the Port of <HI>Canete</HI> of <HI>Guarco,</HI> is three leagues. Here the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> lade Wheat for <HI>Lima</HI> and several o∣ther places. The marks of the Port are, that there is a high Mountain, called the Mountain of <HI>Guarco,</HI> which appears as if it was split in two, and the Sea falls with a great force upon it. It hath a Fort on the top of it, which appears white when you are off at Sea.</P>
<P>From <HI>Canete</HI> or <HI>Guarco</HI> to <HI>Chinca,</HI> is nine leagues. The Coast runs N. N. W. and S S. E. It is a bad Port, and in it is com¦monly a great Sea. Here is laden Whea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, to be transported to <HI>Li¦ma;</HI> and near it lie three Islands, which are distant from the Custom-house of <HI>Chin¦ca</HI> three leagues, and bear with it N.

<P><PB N="191" REF="234"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From <HI>Chinca</HI> to <HI>Pisco,</HI> is three leagues. <HI>Pisco</HI> is a Bay, in which is a Port; and at the bottom of the Port, is a River of fresh water. All the Coast is clear and good; and there is good riding in six fathom wa∣ter. At this place they lade Wine in great quantity, with which they supply most places hereabouts. The Land is very high and mountainous. The Hills are barren; but the Valleys are full of pleasant Vine∣yards; with the Grapes of which they make extraordinary good Wine; this be∣ing one of the chief places for Wine on all the Coast.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pisco</HI> to <HI>Paraca,</HI> is three leagues. It is a good Port, and lyes in the Latitude of 13 d. 30 m. <HI>S.</HI> Hereabouts the Valleys are planted with abundance of Wheat; and they also make store of Wine.</P>
<P>From <HI>Paraca</HI> to the Mount of St <HI>Gallan,</HI> is two leagues. It is a high Mount, and barren, having not any green thing upon it. Over-against the Mount is a high Island called the Island of <HI>Lobos,</HI> which is a league distant from the Main. A∣bout this Island are many Rocks; and near the Mount, is a shole. The Mount lyes in the Latitude of 14 d. South.</P>
<P>The Land here, is of a prodigious height; lying in Ridges parallel to the shore, three or four Ridges one within the other, and each surpassing the other
<PB N="192" REF="235"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> in height. Those that are furthest within Land are the highest, and they always ap∣pear Blue to those that pass by them at Sea.</P>
<P>The Weather upon this Coast of <HI>Pe∣ru,</HI> from the Latitude of 30 d. South to Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> in the Latitude of 3 d. 45 m. South, is always fair; here never being any storms of Wind or Rain; although many times it is so hazey, that there is no taking an observation with the Qua∣drant. Also upon all this Coast are but very few Rivers; they being in some places a hundred and sixty or a hundred and seven∣ty leagues asunder; whereas on the Coast of <HI>Mexico</HI> are abundance of Rivers, many within half a league or a league of each other. Also the Rivers of the Coast of <HI>Mexico</HI> are always full, and many times overflow their Banks; but these on this Coast of <HI>Peru,</HI> are little and shallow, and at some certain times of the Year quite dry.</P>
<P>In the Island <HI>Lobos,</HI> is a good Harbour, which has two Mouths; but they com∣monly enter by that which lies to the S. E. and come out at that which lyes to the N. W.</P>
<P>From this Island to the Mountain of <HI>Asia,</HI> is twelve leagues. The Coast runs N. N. W. and S. S. E. and it is pretty Windy hereabouts. Near this Mount of <HI>Asia</HI> on the East side, is an anchoring place,
<PB N="193" REF="236"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> in a small Port, called the Port of <HI>Cavales.</HI> This Port is somewhat dangerous, by rea∣son of several sholes near it. It lies in the Latitude of 15 d. 00 m. South. One League to the S. E. of this Port, is a very good Port, called the Port of St <HI>Nicolas.</HI> From whence to the Port of St <HI>John,</HI> is three Leagues. Its Entry is at a Bay, and you may go through any part of it. This Port is very windy, and is said to have no fresh Water. At it they make a small quantity of Wines, which they send by shipping to <HI>Lima</HI> and <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>From the Port of St <HI>John</HI> to <HI>Acary,</HI> is nine Leagues. The Coast runs S. S. E. and N. N. W. It is a low Coast by the Water-side, (although the Land is very high and mountainous in the Country,) and here is good Anchor-ground; but Ships seldom anchor in it, because of the high Winds and great Sea which is commonly here.</P>
<P>From <HI>Acary</HI> to <HI>Attiquipa,</HI> is 8 leagues. It is high Land towards the Sea-side; and here begin the high mountainous Hills and Deserts of <HI>Atico.</HI> At this Port Ships of the largest size lade with Corn, and other Necessaries. It lies in the Latitude of 16 d. South. It blows not so much here, as near the Mount of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>From this Port to the Mount of <HI>Atico,</HI> is fourteen Leagues. The Coast runs S. E. and N. W. It is a bold shore, and high Land
<PB N="194" REF="237"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> by the Sea-side; but within it is much higher.</P>
<P>From <HI>Atico</HI> to <HI>Ocana</HI> is 8 leagues. At <HI>O¦cana</HI> is a River of fresh Water, but at some certain times it is dry. Near the River, on the Main land, is some broken Ground; and on the Sea-Coast are some Rocks, which are called the <HI>Piscadores.</HI> About them are a great many sorts of very good Fish, and the Inha∣bitants of <HI>Ocana</HI> come hither often to fish.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ocana</HI> to <HI>Camana,</HI> is six Leagues. The Coast runs S. S. E. It is a good Coast; and here the <HI>Spaniards</HI> make abundance of very good Wine.</P>
<P>From <HI>Camana</HI> to the Port of <HI>Chule,</HI> is five Leagues. This is a good Harbour for Ships; but there lies a Rock a little to the S. E. of it, which you must not come in less than a League of; for there is a shole about half a League round it; But keep∣ing a League from the said Rock, there is a good Entry.</P>
<P>From hence to the Port of <HI>Quilca,</HI> is eight Leagues. In the way is the Island <HI>Guara;</HI> which is a pretty high but barren Island. A little to the Southward of this Island, is a good Port, called the Port of <HI>Ariquipa.</HI> It is a good Port. In it are five great and small Rocks, of a whitish Co∣lour. They lie in the Latitude of 17 d 20 m. South; and in going in, the Entry is very narrow; but within there is eighteen
<PB N="195" REF="238"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> fathom Water; and the Port, when you are in, resembles the Coil of a Cable. Within is a great Vulcan, called the Vulcan of <HI>Ariquipa,</HI> which Vulcan is said to be sixteen Leagues within Land, and is the highest of all the Hills hereabouts. VVhether it burns now or no, I know not; but I suppose, by its Name, it has for∣merly. From this Port of <HI>Ariquipa,</HI> to the Port of <HI>Ylo,</HI> is twelve Leagues. The Coast runneth S. S. W. and N. N. E. And two Leagues from <HI>Ariquipa,</HI> is the River of <HI>Tambo;</HI> In which space is a League of low Land near the Sea-side; and there is good clear Ground, from six to twelve fathom Water.</P>
<P>From the River <HI>Tambo</HI> to <HI>Yerba Buena,</HI> is two Leagues; and from thence to the Port of <HI>Ylo,</HI> eight Leagues. This is a good Port to lade and unlade a Cargo in; and near to it, is a River of fresh Water, called the River of <HI>Ylo.</HI> This, as most of the other Rivers of <HI>Peru,</HI> runs with a quick Current from the beginning of <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI> till the latter end of <HI>June;</HI> and then it decreases, running slower and slower, till the latter end of <HI>September;</HI> After which it wholly fails, and becomes dry; the VVaters not beginning to run again, till <HI>January.</HI> This most of the Rivers on the Coast of <HI>Peru</HI> are said to do as constantly, as the Year goes about. Near to this Ri∣ver
<PB N="196" REF="239"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> is a Valley very well inhabited by <HI>In∣dians,</HI> in which they have store of Corn, and other Provisions, and several sorts of very good Fruits. The Point of <HI>Ylo</HI> is low Land, and runneth out into the Sea. It is dangerous coming near it; for off it lies an Island, and several Rocks. It is in the Latitude of 18 d. South. To those that are off at Sea, the Point looks like two or three Islands; and it bears with the Mount of <HI>Sama,</HI> S. W. and N. E. di∣stance eight Leagues.</P>
<P>This Mount of <HI>Sama,</HI> is a high Mount; and under it are four pieces of broken Ground, of a whitish Colour. Near to it, is a small River called the River of <HI>Sama.</HI></P>
<P>From hence to the River of <HI>John Dens,</HI> is four Leagues. This River lies in the very bottom of the Bay of <HI>Arica,</HI> and the Banks of it are very well peopled with <HI>In∣dians.</HI></P>
<P>From the River of <HI>John Deus</HI> to the Ri∣ver of <HI>Arica,</HI> is two Leagues. On the Banks of this River is situated the Town of <HI>Arica.</HI> It is a large Town, inhabited by <HI>Spaniards, Mullattoes, Mostese</HI> and <HI>In¦dians.</HI> This Port of <HI>Arica</HI> lies in the La¦titude of 18 d. 20 m.

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> to most of the Mine-Tows of <HI>Peru.</HI> It is a place of very great Trade, and seldom or never without shipping. It is a good place to anchor in; and the best and com∣mon anchoring place, is close under the Mount of <HI>Arica,</HI> which is a great high Mountain, and defends Ships that ride there from the South-winds. The depth of the Water, is about eight fathom. VVithout the anchoring place, is a small Island, called the <HI>Isletta.</HI> The Land here is very high and mountainous; and from hence for near a hundred Leagues to the South∣ward, it is very much subject to Calms within thirty-five or forty Leagues of the shore. These Calms are not usual on any other part of this Coast, that I know of. VVhen the Sun is in the Northern Signs, that is, from <HI>March</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> the VVeather is commonly fair and clear; But when the Sun returns back into Sou∣thern Signs, then the VVeather for the most part is hazy, and the Horizon so thick, as often to hinder an Observati∣on.</P>
<P>From the Mount of <HI>Arica</HI> to <HI>Chacola,</HI> is a League and half. Here is a very good ancho∣ring place. And from hence to the broken Land of <HI>Victor,</HI> is a League and half more.

<P>From <HI>Tucames</HI> to the Island <HI>Yaneque,</HI> is twelve Leagues; from which place they carry Clay to lay in the Valleys of <HI>Arica</HI> and <HI>Sama;</HI> and here live some few <HI>Indian</HI> People, who are continually digging this clayey Ground for the use aforesaid; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> reckon that it fattens the Land very much.</P>
<P>From hence to the Bay of <HI>Majalones,</HI> is twenty Leagues, all high mountainous Land, and a great Sea falling upon the Shore, so that there is scarce any landing. From <HI>Majalones</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Salado,</HI> is eight leagues. In neither of these Bays is there any fresh water.</P>
<P>From the Bay of <HI>Salado</HI> to the Mount of <HI>Moreno,</HI> is fourteen leagues. The Coast runs North and South. In this Port of the Mount of <HI>Moreno,</HI> is store of Salt; and here is very good fresh water to be had. It is a good Port, and in it you are defend∣ed from all Winds. Within the Port, the best riding is on the North-side. It is a very high Mount, and like to the Mount of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> which on the top has a great Rock.</P>
<P>From the Mount of <HI>Moreno</HI> to the Mount of St <HI>George,</HI> is twelve leagues. Except at this Mount of St <HI>George,</HI> there is no ancho¦ring hereabouts.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FRom hence the Land is all very high and barren to <HI>Copiapo,</HI> which lies in the Latitude of 21 d. South; and we found
<PB N="200" REF="243"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> variation 2 d. 50 m. Easterly. It is a good Port, and defended from all Winds. Near into the Port are four or five Rocks. The water on shore is brackish. It is inhabited within Land by <HI>Indians,</HI> who make good Wine; and here is good Meat, Corn and other Necessaries. The marks of the Mount of <HI>Copiapo,</HI> are, that it looks like the Point of <HI>Saint Hellena,</HI> and that about a league to the Southward is an Island. In this Port they load Wine, Money and other Goods, for <HI>Coquimbo.</HI></P>
<P>From the Island which lies by the Mount of <HI>Copiapo,</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Salado,</HI> is five leagues; in which Bay is an anchoring∣place, and a River of fresh water. From the Bay of <HI>Salado</HI> to <HI>Totoral,</HI> is ten leagues. The best riding here, is on the North side of the Point; which will be a defense from the South-winds. At this place is good wood and water to be had.</P>
<P>From <HI>Totoral</HI> to the Port of <HI>Guasco,</HI> is ten leagues; all the way high mountainous Land, but a clear Coast from Rocks or Sholes. Within the Port is a small round Island; and at the bottom of the Bay, near this Island, is a River of fresh water; right against the Mouth of which, is the common anchoring-place. The Country hereabouts is said to be pretty well inhabi∣ted by <HI>Spaniards.</HI> In this Port you are de∣fended from the South and South West
<PB N="201" REF="244"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Winds. The Land is pretty plain and e∣ven; and at the top of the Port is a Plain of Sand. Off the South West Point of the Port, are seven or eight Rocks; about which are many Sholes, and there is no sailing between them and the Main.</P>
<P>From hence to the Port of <HI>Coquimbo,</HI> is ten leagues. <HI>Coquimbo</HI> is a good Port; and the common anchoring-place is right against a small round Island, on the South side of the Port, called the Island of <HI>Tor∣tuga:</HI> Without this Island, near to the South West Point of the Port, are two Rocks; but any Ship may go between them and the Main; for there is very deep water. To the Northward of these Rocks, are the Islands of <HI>Paxores,</HI> which are eight or nine in number. There is deep water between them; and amongst them are caught several sorts of very good Fish, with which they supply the City of <HI>Coquimbo.</HI> Some of these Islands are very high and rocky; but the Land upon the Main, is not altogether so high as it was from <HI>Copiapo</HI> to this place. A little on the North East side of this Port, is a noted great Hill, in fashion of a Sugar-loaf; at the bottom of which, is situated the City of <HI>Coquimbo;</HI> which is said to be a large and very rich City; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> driving a great Trade with <HI>Lima, Panama,</HI> and most of the South-sea Coast.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="245"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From the Port of <HI>Coquimbo</HI> to the <HI>Her∣radura,</HI> is three leagues; and they bear from each other South South East, and North North West. This <HI>Herradura</HI> is a small deep sandy Bay, but seldom made use of by shipping; although in it is good fast anchor-ground. But the reason is, it lies too much open to South West and o∣ther Southerly winds.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Herradura</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Ton∣goi,</HI> is four leagues. At the bottom of the Bay is a River of fresh water; and right against the Rivers Mouth, is the common anchoring place, where is good defense from all the Southerly winds.</P>
<P>From this Bay of <HI>Tongoi</HI> to the Port of <HI>Lymary,</HI> is eight leagues. The Coast runs North North East and South South West The marks of this Port are, that ir hath a great Mount near it, called the Mount of <HI>Lymary;</HI> the sides of which, either to the Northward or Southward, appear full of high Trees; and in the middle of the Mount is broken Ground; and to the South VVest of it, are two Breasts or Bo∣soms.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lymary</HI> to <HI>Choape</HI> is ten leagues. This <HI>Choape</HI> is a high Hill; it has neither Port nor anchoring-place, but the Coast is full of Rocks.</P>
<P>From <HI>Choape</HI> to the Port of <HI>Govanadore,</HI> is thirteen leagues. This Port lyes in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> Latitude of 31 d. 20 m. South, and Lon∣gitude from <HI>London</HI> West 75 d. 30 m. The Land is of a great height, three rows of Hills one within the other. The Port of <HI>Govanadore</HI> is a good and safe Port. It is defended from the South-winds, which are the common Trade-winds of this Coast. The anchoring place is right against the lowest part of the Land, in twelve fathom water. At the end of the small piece of low Land, is a Hill which has broken ground on the top of it, and looketh like the Chair of <HI>Paita.</HI> On the N. W. side of this Hill, is a Grove of great high Trees; and near the Port is an Island; on the North side of which is a good anchoring place and secure riding; for the Island it self keeps off the Southerly Winds.</P>
<P>From this Port off <HI>Govanadore</HI> to the Port of <HI>Laligna,</HI> is five leagues. Near the Point of this Port, are two sholes, on which, at high water, there is not above ten foot water. In this Port Ships lye at anchor in five fathom water, and here Ships load with Wheat and other Eatables for <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Laligna</HI> to <HI>Papuda,</HI> is three leagues. It is deep, but very good anchor ground. It hath a high Hill, with broken ground on the top of it; and near it, is a spot of Trees. So that it is very like the Port of <HI>Govanadore.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="247"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From <HI>Papuda</HI> to the Rocks of <HI>Clintera,</HI> is five leagues. These Rocks lye visible above water; and near the Land, the Currents set strong to the Northward. Ships often sail pretty near these Rocks; for it is all clear and deep, seldom less than twelve fathom Water.</P>
<P>From these Rocks of <HI>Clintera,</HI> to the Port of <HI>Clintera,</HI> is two leagues. In it is deep water; and the Port has only a de∣fense from the South winds, but to all Westerly winds it lyes open. This Port bears with <HI>Valpariso</HI> N. N. E. and S. S. W. distance sive leagues: And between, it is all very high and mountainous Land: Yet between the Hills, are many pleasant Valleys, which afford good Corn and Wine.</P>
<P>Near the Point of <HI>Concon,</HI> is a little Bay, in which are four small Rocks; each of these Rocks has a small shole quite round them, and the anchoring place is close o∣ver to the South shore; and in between the said Rocks, at the bottom of the Bay, is a small River, called the River of <HI>Con∣con;</HI> upon the Banks of which are situated several small <HI>Indian</HI> Towns and Villages. Here are several tall and large Trees, which upon occasion will make very good Masts for Ships.</P>
<P>A little to the Southward of this Point of <HI>Concon,</HI> is a large River, called the Ri∣ver
<PB N="205" REF="248"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> of <HI>Chily;</HI> upon the Banks of which, are several Towns and Villages belonging to both <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> This Ri∣ver is said to run some hundreds of Miles within Land. About half a League to the Southward of the Mouth of this River, are two small high Rocks; they lie about a Mile and a half from the shore. They have each of them a small shole of Sand round them; and there is no sailing be∣tween them and the Main, because it is shole-water.</P>
<P>From these Rocks to the Port of <HI>Valpa∣rizo</HI> or St <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Chili,</HI> is three Leagues. Here are four or five small Rivers running into this Bay, which make the Port of <HI>Valparizo.</HI> I do not know any where so many Rivers so near each other, upon all the Coasts of <HI>Peru</HI> or <HI>Chili:</HI> But upon the Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> it is very common. This Port lies in the Latitude of 32 d. 30 m. South. It is a place of great Trade, and from hence they send yearly several Ships laded with Corn, Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and store of Gold. For although <HI>Peru</HI> is reckoned to abound in Silver, yet <HI>Chili</HI> is most abun∣dant in Gold. Here is a pretty Town of three hundred Houses, belonging to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> all pretty well built with Brick; But in none of these Parts of <HI>Peru</HI> or <HI>Chili</HI> are they so well built, as they are in and about <HI>Mexico.</HI> The Reason, as I

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> suppose, is, that at <HI>Mexico</HI> they have a great many of their Materials from <HI>Old Spain,</HI> which here they cannot so well have. This place is govern'd by a <HI>Spanish</HI> Governour, as are all the Sea-ports: But in the Country within Land, there are se∣veral Cities, Towns and Villages, gover∣ned by <HI>Indian</HI> Governours; yet with Sub∣ordination to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> This Port is famous for the great Trade it drives with <HI>Lima</HI> and the other Parts of <HI>Peru;</HI> as also for the rich Prize taken in it by our <HI>English</HI> Hero Sir <HI>Francis Drake;</HI> in which Ship he took a vast quantity of Gold, besides se∣veral other valuable Commodities. He also took the Town; in which he found store of Provisions. The Anchoring-place is at the bottom of the Bay, close under the South-shore, in seven, eight and nine Fathom Water, good fast Ground, right∣against the Mouth of the River <HI>Buajes;</HI> where is a very good defense from all the South or Westerly Winds, by reason of a Point of Land, called the Point of St <HI>James of Chili,</HI> which shoots out to the North∣ward, and lies between the Anchoring∣place and the Sea. At this Point is a shole of Sand; which, as the Point does, stret∣ches away to the Northward; so that it is dangerous coming near the said Point; for the Shole runs out beyond it, near half a league: and at high water there is not a∣bove
<PB N="207" REF="250"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> nine foot water on it. The Coast here runs South South East, and North North West.</P>
<P>From the Point of <HI>Valparizo</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Zenaque,</HI> is one league: And from thence to the Bay of <HI>Rio,</HI> another. In this Bay is a little Rock, which is called <HI>Bishops Rock.</HI> From this Rock to the Bay of <HI>Sa∣linas,</HI> is four leagues. In this Bay is a good anchoring place, and it has a good de∣fense from the Southerly winds. It is low Land by the Sea-side, although in the Country it is very high and mountainous. Here are several small Bays, in most of which is good riding in ten fathom Wa∣ter.</P>
<P>From these Bays to <HI>Topa de Calma,</HI> is four leagues. Between them are the Sholes of <HI>Raphael,</HI> and a River of the same name right against them. These Sholes come out a league into the Sea, and there is no going between them and the main Land; for the Water is very shole. At <HI>Topa de Calma</HI> is an anchoring-place, but it lies o∣pen to the Southerly Winds; and near it, is an Island, on the North-side of which is a small Bay, in which Ships upon occasi∣on sometimes come to an anchor: and in the said Bay is not less than twenty-five fathom Water. This place is much fre∣quented with high winds.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="251"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From <HI>Topa de Calma</HI> to <HI>Lora,</HI> is four∣teen leagues. This <HI>Lora</HI> has broken Ground like to <HI>Lymary;</HI> and part of the Coast in the way, is low Land by the Sea∣side, till you come to the River of <HI>Maule;</HI> which is distant from <HI>Topa de Calma</HI> seven leaves. In this River is two fathom at low water. In it are said to be many <HI>In∣dian</HI> Towns and Villages, in which they have plenty of Provisions. It is a very windy place, and at the entry of the Ri∣ver are two Rocks; half a league to Lee∣ward of which, is a small anchoring∣place. From this River of <HI>Maule,</HI> to <HI>Lo∣ra,</HI> as I said before, is seven leagues. Near to the broken Ground is an anchoring place, which has a defense from the South∣erly Winds.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lora</HI> to the Point of <HI>Ʋnmos,</HI> is three leagues. It is a bad Point, having abundance of foul Ground lying off it. On this Point were cast away two great <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Ships, and all their Men drowned. It is good to keep at a distance from it.</P>
<P>From the Point of <HI>Ʋnmos</HI> to the River <HI>Itata,</HI> is seven leagues. The River is ex∣traordinarily well inhabited by <HI>Spaniads</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> and on the South-side, near the River's Mouth, is an anchoring-place The Coast is deep from <HI>Topa de Calma</HI> to this place, without any Port or an-choring place, excepting those I have named.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="252"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From the River <HI>Itata</HI> to the Point of <HI>Sinfonda,</HI> is four leagues. This Point runs out a good way; and to the Southward of it, is a fine Bay, called the <HI>Herradura;</HI> at the bottom of which is a River; and on each side the River, is broken Ground. This <HI>Herradura</HI> is in form like the Letter C. It hath three Rocks at the entry, and within is defended from the North and South Winds.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Herradura</HI> to the Island <HI>Qui∣quina,</HI> is two leagues, North East and South West. This Island is four-square; and on the East-side is a small Bay, in which is very good anchoring in five fa∣thom water. Ships that come from the Northward, go between this Island and the Main, on the North East side, when they are bound to the Port of <HI>the Conception;</HI> and it is a clear and good Passage, free from any Rocks, Sands or Sholes; and it is deep water. But Ships that come from the Southward, go in between the South Shore and the South West side of the I∣sland; but they always keep nearest to the Island, by reason of a Rock and Shole which lie about a mile and a half off the Main. This Rock and Shole is called the <HI>Grifo,</HI> and is very dangerous: For several good Ships have been lost upon it. And a little within this <HI>Grifo,</HI> is another dange∣rous Shole, called the <HI>Mormao.</HI> A little

But the chief anchoring place is right against the City of <HI>the Conception.</HI> Here are seve∣ral small Rivers, but none of note. This City is near to the Sea-side. It is a very pleasant place, having a fine River running through it; And three quarters of a mile from the City, is another fine Ri∣ver, called <HI>Anderlen.</HI> Ships that ride in the Port of <HI>Conception,</HI> must come to an anchor right-against the Fort of <HI>Don Gar∣cia;</HI> that they may be ready to sail with a North-wind.

<P>From this Port to the River <HI>Biobio,</HI> is two Leagues. This River runneth very strong with a great Current, and hath two Rocks at the Entry of it. At this River beginneth the high Land of <HI>Guera;</HI> This Land is accounted by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be the highest Land of any yet known in the World; far exceeding the <HI>Pico</HI> of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> or <HI>Santa Martha,</HI> or any Land yet disco∣vered. Near this River are the Breasts of <HI>Biobio;</HI> which are two high Hills, natu∣rally in the form of Breasts.</P>
<P>From this River to <HI>Labipi,</HI> is seven Leagues. In the Harbour of <HI>Labipi</HI> is se∣cure riding, and it has a defence from the North and South Winds. Near this Har∣bour is the Island of <HI>Santa Maria;</HI> in the Latitude of 37 d. 30 m. South. This is a low Island, about two Leagues in length; It is very well inhabited by <HI>Indians.</HI> On the N. E. side, is a fine deep and secure Bay, in which is from twelve to four fa∣thom good fast sandy Ground; the Wa∣ter growing shallow gradually, as one goes nearer to the bottom of the Bay.</P>
<P>From the Island of <HI>Santa Maria</HI> to the Island <HI>Canero,</HI> is ten Leagues; and they bear from each other N. W. and S. E.
<PB N="212" REF="255"/>
<MILESTONE N="170" UNIT="year"/> The Land here upon the Main, is of a pro∣digious height, but here is no Port or Place of anchoring, unless it be in the Port of <HI>Canero.</HI> In this Port is the Island <HI>Canero.</HI> It is a small Island, lying on the North-side of the Port, just within its en∣trance. And at the bottom of the Bay is a small River of fresh Water. In this Port are no Rocks nor Sholes, nor any danger, but all gradual Soundings; and it has a a good defense from the S. and S. W. and other Westerly Winds, which are the worst Winds upon the Coast.</P>
<P>The Winds here are variable all round the Compass, as it is upon all the Coast of <HI>Chili.</HI> Upon the Coast of <HI>Peru,</HI> from the Line to 30 degrees of Southern Lati∣tude, the common Trade-wind is Souther∣ly, with fine Weather and no Rain; But here upon this Coast, it is common to have hard Gales of Wind, and very often great showers of Rain.</P>
<P>From the Port of <HI>Canero</HI> to the Hill of <HI>Tu∣capel,</HI> is two leagues. This is a high Hill, with a Plain or Table Land on the top. And a little to the Southward of it, is a River of the same Name. The Land hereabouts is very well inhabited by <HI>Indians.</HI> At the Mouth of this River, on the South-side, is a small Point, called the Point of <HI>Tixba.</HI></P>

<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> From this Point to the River <HI>Imperial,</HI> is eight Leagues. This is a large River running a great way up into the Country; and the Banks of it are very well inhabi∣ted by <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Right against the Mouth of the River, is the Island <HI>La Moucha.</HI> This Island is about four or five Leagues in length. It is pretty high Land, and very well clothed with tall and flourishing Trees of several sorts; and on it are several small Rivulets of fresh Water. It is very well inhabited by <HI>Indians,</HI> who are always at War with the <HI>Europeans:</HI> For they think all white Men to be <HI>Spaniards.</HI> This was the Southermost and the first Land we saw upon our coming into the South Seas. About this Island are several sholes, and especially on the West-side, which stretch out a great way into the Sea. On the East-side is a fine Bay, in which is very good safe anchoring. It lies in the Lati∣tude of 38 d. 30 m. South; and I made Longitude from <HI>London</HI> to this place West 78 d. 00 m. and we found variation 8 d. 42 m. Easterly. It was at this place that Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> and his Boats-Crew go∣ing ashore for Water, and asking the <HI>In∣dians</HI> for <HI>Agua,</HI> (which is the <HI>Spanish</HI> name for Water,) the <HI>Indians</HI> by their Language thinking them to be <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with whom they are always at mortal Variance, fell

<P>A little to the South of this Island, on the main Land, is the River of <HI>Tolton;</HI> which is a large River. And here the Rivers are commonly full, as on the Coast of <HI>Mexico;</HI> not drying away at certain times, as they do on the Coast of <HI>Peru.</HI> This River is distant from the Port of <HI>Valdivia</HI> 25 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Valdivia</HI> or <HI>Baldivia,</HI> is a noted place. It lies in the Latitude of 40 d. South. It is very well fortified and hinders the ap∣proach of an Enemy.

Now by good hap we have thought upon a way. Here is Gold; drink thy fill; for here is enough to satisfie the most Covetous.</HI> And immediately they bound him, and poured it down his Throat; with which he presently died, and with his death gave name to this Town and Port of <HI>Valdivia.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> have ever since been at War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and hold them hard to it: And the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are desirous by all means possible to conquer these peo∣ple; that they might be Masters of so rich a Country. For though <HI>Peru</HI> does abound in Silver, yet this Empire of <HI>Chily</HI> is the most aboundant in Gold. And <HI>Mexico</HI> a∣bounds both in Gold and Silver, Cochi∣neel, Indico and Cocoa.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AND now having given a particular Description of the Coast of <HI>Mexico, Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili</HI> (from the Tropic of <HI>Cancer</HI> to 40 d. South) as far as we observed our selves or could learn from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> I shall return to the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla,</HI> where we were fitting our Vessel in order to our intended Voyage for <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>Here therefore we went ashore at the I∣sland <HI>Conchagua,</HI> to seek for water; and after some search, we found behind the Hills a large bottom, in which was a large Plantain-walk, and a great deal of Rain∣water, that fell from the Mountains. This was very inconvenient for us, because ly∣ing so behind the Hills, we knew we must be forced to carry all our water over a high Hill, which we could hardly climb by our selves: But seeing there was no remedy, we first cut down the Bushes which were in our way, to make us a clear Path; Af∣ter which, the Hill being pretty steep on the Land-side, towards the bottom, where∣in was the fresh water; we with our Axes and Shovels cut out steps in the Hill: And our Sail-maker having in the mean time made us a Canvas-Pipe of about ninety fa∣thom
<PB N="220" REF="263"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> long, to carry our water from the top of the Hill down to our Cask which lay at the foot of it; we went to work to fill our water; each Man having with him a six Gallon Cask. The water which we took up was very muddy; and on the top of it grew Duck-weed, as it does usually in our Ditches. At first we raked the Duck-weed away: But our Doctor per∣swading us, that if we took up the weeds, they would mightily preserve our water; we, according to his advice, took up both weeds and water together. When each Man had filled his six Gallon Cask, he car∣ried it up to the top of the Hill, and then poured it into the Canvas-Pipe, which conveyed it down the Hill into our Cask. Thus we employed our selves for four days. And having filled about twenty-five Tuns, which we concluded would last lon∣ger than our Victuals; and got it on board our Vessel; the next day, being the 31st of <HI>January</HI> 1704/5, we all went ashore to the Plantain-walk: And having cut down a sufficient quantity of them, we returned at night on board our Vessel, intending to sail next day. This Evening two of our Men who had resolved to stay with Cap∣tain <HI>Dampier,</HI> left him and came over to us; so that now we were 35 in number, <HI>viz.</HI> thirty-four <HI>English,</HI> and one little <HI>Ne∣gro</HI> Boy, whom we had taken from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="264"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> During the time of our watering our Bark, the Men on board the Ship belong∣ing to Captain <HI>Dampier,</HI> were busie in re∣fitting their Ship as well as they could: The Carpenter stopt the Shot-holes, which they had in their Powder-room, with Tal∣low and Charcoal; not daring, as he said, to drive in a Nail, for fear of making it worse: And the four great Guns, which usually stood between Decks, were put down into the Hold; there being six∣teen besides, which was more than they had Men to manage; for there remained with them no more than twenty-eight Men and Boys, and most of them Land∣men.</P>
<P>On the 1st of <HI>February,</HI> 1704/5, we left the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla,</HI> and Captain <HI>Dam∣pier</HI> in his Ship the St <HI>George</HI> at anchor in it. We steered out between the Island of <HI>Amapalla</HI> and the Island <HI>Mangera;</HI> and many times had not above two fathom Water. We had a fine Gale of Wind at N. E. which soon carryed us out of the Mouth of the Gulf. So long as we had been in any of the Harbours on this Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> we had seldom been allowed any thing but Flower; Excepting that we used to go ashore, and found upon the Rocks store of Conchs, Oysters, Muscles, Snails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which we made many a good Meal: But now being in hopes of
<PB N="222" REF="265"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> getting into a Land of Plenty, we bore Hunger with more patience. And indeed we had great need of Patience. For now our Commons was lessened to half a pound of course Flower a Man <HI>per</HI> Day, with two Ounces of Salt-Meat every other Day. Our Vessel was a small Bark with two Masts, of about seventy Tuns, which we had taken from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> But whilst we lay here, she was so eaten by the Worms, that she begun to grow very leaky; and to add to our Afflictions, we had no Carpenter; neither if any of us should fall sick, had we any Doctor, or any Me∣dicines to make use of; And, which was worst of all, we had no Boat to assist our selves, if our Vessel should fail us; for the Doctor, Carpenter and Boat were left with Captain <HI>Dampier.</HI> But trusting to Gods Providence, who had already deli∣vered us out of so many dangers, we pro∣ceeded on our intended Voyage for <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>On the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Febuary</HI> we had a calm most part of the day and night; and this day we caught several Fish called <HI>Yellow∣tails,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXVIII.</NOTE> which came swimming about our Vessel. These Fish were about four Foot in length. He had twenty Fins on his Back; one middling one near the hinder∣part of his Head, one large one near the middle of his Back, and eighteen small ones stretching from the said large one to
<PB N="223" REF="266"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> his Tail. He had two large Fins near his Gills, one of each side; and thirteen un∣der his Belly; <HI>viz.</HI> one middling one un∣derneath near the Gills; one large one near the middle of his Belly, which goes in with a Dent, and eleven small ones stretching from the said large one to his Tail, which is Half-moon'd. He has a very large Head, a great Eye, and is ex∣traordinary good Food. It is very Fleshy, having no Bone but the Back-bone. These Fish, when taken by us, looked very white; but the tips of their Fins and Tail, were yellow; for which reason we called them <HI>Yellow-tails.</HI> They were very welcome to us; for whilst they lasted, which was three days, we saved our own Provisions, feeding upon nothing else but this Fish.</P>
<P>On the 3<HI>d</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> the first part of the day it continued calm, in which time five or six Turtles coming near the Vessel, we caught two of them; which still ser∣ved to help us out. About six in the E∣vening we had the Land-wind at N. E. a fine fresh Gale: So we took our departure from the Mount of St <HI>Michaels,</HI> a noted Mount, of which I have already given a Description. It lies in the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla,</HI> in the Latitude of 13 d. North. We rec∣koned Longitude from <HI>London</HI> West. 97 d. 30 m. and, as I said before, we found Va∣riation
<PB N="224" REF="267"/>
<MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"/> 3 d. 26 m. westerly. We steered away S. W. the sooner to get off the Land into the true N. E. or E. N. E. Trade. For we knew the present Wind to be only the Land-wind, which we could not think would last long. For we did not expect to get into the true Trade, till we had run about ninety or a hundred leagues from the Land. For which reason we steered away, as I said, S. W. and S. W. by W. Which course we held till we came into the Latitude of 10 d. When finding our selves in the true Trade, we hauled away VV. N. VV. intending to get into the Latitude of 13 d. North; and so as near as we could, to maintain our Latitude till our arrival at the <HI>Ladrone</HI> Islands; know∣ing, if we kept in that Latitude, it was impossible to miss them; We had fine fresh Gales of VVind, first at N. E; but as we run off the Land, we found it edge to the N. E. by E, and thence to the E. N. E; where it continued with us till our passing the <HI>Ladrone</HI> Islands. VVe now made us studding Sails out of our Main∣sail and Main-top-sail. VVe got our stud∣ding Sails up by day break every morning, and at Sun-set haul'd them down again: For it commonly blew so fresh in the Night, that we were forced to settle our Top-sail; and with the rising of the Sun, the VVind would something abate again:
<PB N="225" REF="268"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> Yet we always had as much as we could well carry with our Studding-sails. The Trade-wind we found here to blow much brisker than it does in the <HI>Atlantick</HI> or <HI>East-Indian</HI> Oceans.</P>
<P>For the first twenty Days after our Fish and Turtle was gone, we fed upon no∣thing but our Plantains, of which we al∣lowed our selves two for a Meal, and two such Meals a day: But after our Plantains were gone, we went to our half pound of Flower a Man <HI>per</HI> day, and our two ounces of Salt Beef or Pork every other day. The Meat had been so long in Salt, that when we boiled it, it commonly shrunk one half. So we finding a loss in boiling our Meat, concluded to eat it raw; which we did all the Voyage after, so long as it lasted. We now and then caught a Dolphin, and sometimes saw a great many Sea-birds, as Boobies, Noddies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which would come and settle upon our Vessel; and happy was he, that could catch one of them.</P>
<P>In this Run I think none of us took the pains to observe by the AZ<HI>th</HI> Compass. For the variation was so little, that we never minded it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> On the 10th of <HI>April</HI> 1705, towards Evening, we saw the Clouds gather about the Horizon much more than usual. This was a great sign or token of Land. For
<PB N="226" REF="269"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> it is common between the Tropicks to be foggy or cloudy over the Land; although it be never so clear at Sea. Therefore all this Night we took a special care to look out; and on the 11th in the Morning be∣times we saw the Island of <HI>Magon</HI> bearing West, distant about ten Leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXIX.</NOTE> It was a high woody Island, and very plain and green on the top. So we stood towards it; and when we had brought it to bear North, distant about a Mile, I took the Draught of it, which appeared as in the Figure. Being in so near, we laid our Ship by; and several fishing Boats came to us, and brought us some Fish, with some Eggs, Yams, Potatoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These vvere very acceptable to us; for now our Salt Beef and Pork was just at an end; and we had nothing to trust to, but our half pound of Flower a Day for each Man, and that very full of Vermine, Maggots and Spiders. The Men in those Fishing-Boats were a very tall and large-limb'd People, of a tawny Complexion, having long black Hair reaching down to their middle: They all go stark-naked, not so much as covering their Privy-parts. In exchange of what we had of them, we would have given them Money; but they looked on it and gave it us again, ma∣king Signs to us to give them Tobacco in the room of it; which we did, and
<PB N="227" REF="270"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> they seemed very much pleased. We also gave them some old Shirts, which they immediately tore in pieces, and rowled them round about their Heads. We would have given each of them a Dram of Bran∣dy, but they were afraid to drink it. Only one of them, seeing us drink to each o∣ther, and that it did us no hurt, at last made Signs that he would drink with us. So we gave him a good Glass full, which he immediately drank off; but we thought the Fellow would never shut his Mouth again; for he was so amazed at the Heat it had left in his Mouth and in his Belly, that I believe he thought he had set himself on Fire. He laid himself down and roared like a Bull; which scared most of the rest of them away. After he had roared near half an Hour, he fell fast a sleep: And we being in haste, put the poor Fellow in∣to his Boat; and made signs to his Con∣sorts to take care of him, that he might not fall over-board. They seemed to be a very civil People; but however we did not care to let too many of them come in∣to our Vessel at a time. Their Language we could not understand at all. When they first approached us, they tied two Sticks together in fashion of a Cross, and held them up for us to see: Which was, as we suppose, to signifie to us that they had some Knowledge of the Christian Re∣ligion.
<PB N="228" REF="271"/>
<MILESTONE N="1745" UNIT="year"/> We in return showed them a Cru∣cifix, which we had taken from the <HI>Spa∣niards;</HI> at the sight of which they all bowed their Bodies, and came on board. This Island of <HI>Magon</HI> I make to lie in the Latitude of 13 d. 00 m. North; and we made Longitude from the Mount of St <HI>Michael's</HI> W. 120 d. 09 m. or 7029 Miles; allowing between 58 and 59 Miles to a degree of Longitude in this Parallel. The Boats which these Fishermen came on board in, were about forty foot in length, and a∣bout seventeen or eighteen Inches broad a∣loft, but not above three Inches broad be∣low. Their Head and Stern were alike. The bottom to the Waters edge, was one entire piece, but hollow; upon which, for the side of the Boat, was a piece of thin Plank, about three foot broad, and of the same length as the Boat it self. It had its lower Edge sowed with Rattans to the bottom of the Boat. They had two long Poles put out of one side; One was with∣in ten foot of one end of the Boat, and the other within ten foot of the other end: So that they lay distant from each other about twenty foot. The Poles were about thirty foot in length; at the end of which was a long piece of Plank of about twenty-one foot, of the same shape, and about one fourth part of the bigness of the bottom of the Boat. This piece is laid a∣cross
<PB N="229" REF="272"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> at the outer end of the Poles, from one Pole to the other; where it is very se∣curely made fast: And this altogether, is called the Out-leaker. This is always the Weather-side; and the use of it, is to keep the Boat from over-setting. For without the Out-leaker the Boat is so narrow, that it would not bear it self. They have but one Sail, which is made of Matt, and like our <HI>Bermudo's</HI> Sail. It is not above two Inches broad at top, and hauls out by a Boom. When they have a mind to go about; it is only letting go the Sheet of the Sail, and hauling it aft on the same side at the other end of the Boat; and then that which was the Stern before, is now become the Head; any end going foremost, and no distinction in the built of either end: But the same Side still and always remains the Weather-side. Most of these Boats were painted red. <HI>See the Figure of the Boat with its Out-leaker.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXX.</NOTE></P>
<P>We were now in Consultation amongst our selves, whether we should steer away for the North West, amongst the <HI>Philip∣pine</HI> Islands; or to the South West, for the Coast of <HI>New-Guinea;</HI> But after a debate of about two Hours, we concluded to haul away South West, for the Cape of <HI>New Guinea.</HI> Which accordingly we did; and the same day passed by the Island of <HI>Guam,</HI> which lies South from the Island
<PB N="230" REF="273"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> of <HI>Magon,</HI> about seven leagues: So that I make this Island to lie in the Lati∣tude of 12 d. 39 m. North. We only pas∣sed by it at a distance. Wherefore I can give no particular Description of it. Yet as we passed by, I took a Draught of it, as it ap∣peared to us South, distance 5 leagues. The Land to us seemed of an indifferent height; but it was quite plain and flat on the top. This Island belongs to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have a small Fortification on it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXXI.</NOTE> It is kept for the conveniency of the <HI>Manila</HI>-Ship, which always touches here to refresh, in her way to <HI>Manila.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we kept our Course South West, and passed by the Island of <HI>Matan,</HI> which lies about six leagues due North from the Islan <HI>Guam.</HI> And at six this same Evening, being <HI>April</HI> the 11th, we took our departure from the Island of <HI>Magon,</HI> it then bearing North East, distant nine leagues. We still had a fresh Gale, as u∣sual, at East by North and East North East. And on the 17th we saw the Island of <HI>Arra∣cife,</HI> bearing East by North, distant 10 leagues. It seemed to be a very high Island. Whe∣ther it is inhabited or no, I know not.</P>
<P>From hence we steered away South South West, till we came into the Latitude of 5 d. North. Hitherto we had fine fresh Gales of wind at North East; but now drawing near the Line, we sound the Winds veer

North, and then we had a Calm for seven days. This was a great disheartning to us; for now we had so little Victuals, that it would hardly keep us alive. For we could not allow our selves any more than six Ounces of course Flower a Man <HI>per</HI> day. This we used to scald with hot water, and so eat it. For want of suffici∣ent Food, we now found our selves to grow very weak. But it was our good For∣tune to have store of Water, of which, when we could not sleep for hunger, we would drink a large draught: This would satisfie us a little at the present so that we could sleep; but as soon as we waked, we al∣ways found our selves as hungry as before.</P>
<P>On the 3d of <HI>May,</HI> sprung up a small Gale of Wind at West; and we steered a∣way South, till being almost out of hopes, because the Wind began to die away again, on the 5th, about ten in the Evening, we smelt a very fine and fragrant smell, which gave us new hopes that we were near some Land. We looked over our Draughts; but they gave no Description of any; yet we were sure we could not be far off some Land, from whence that fragrant smell must proceed. So we continued in our hopes till the next Morning; when ac∣cordingly
<PB N="232" REF="276"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> we saw Land right a-head of us, as far as we could see. And a small Gale springing up at South East, we steered a∣way South West by West directly to it. By Noon we made it to be three small Islands, very low Land, but all very green and pleasant. At the same time we had an Ob∣servation, and found our selves in the La∣titude of 00 d. 50 m. North. The East∣ermost of the said three Islands bearing South East, distant about four leagues, which makes its Latitude to be 00 d. 42 m. North.</P>
<P>At the same time we caught two <HI>Bone∣toes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXXII.</NOTE> which were very welcome to us; for they made a good Meal for all our Com∣pany; And this was the first we had had for a long time. This Fish is commonly of about three foot in length, and two foot about. It hath two middling Fins on his Back, with eleven small ones stretching to his Tail. He hath the like number op∣posite under his Belly: with two large ones, one on each side, near his Gills. He hath a very sharp Head, with a small Mouth, a full Eye, and a half-moon'd Tail. It is a very fleshy Fish, having no Bone but his Back-bone: And they make very good Broth.</P>
<P>All this Night we stood off and on; de∣signing not to venture too near these un∣known Islands in the Night; not knowing
<PB N="233" REF="277"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> what danger there might be near them. The next Morning, at Day-break, being <HI>May</HI> the 7th, we found our selves within a Ships length of a great ledge of Rocks, which ran from 1 Island to the other; which we not seeing before, and thinking to go between the two Islands, had like to have been upon them; But through God's great Mercy, a small breeze of Wind coming from the Shore, we got off, and stood to the westermost Island; because we saw many Sholes lying off the rest of them. The Rocks we had like to have been upon, were near the Northermost Island; which, upon account of our miraculous escape, we call'd the Island of <HI>Deceit;</HI> it having, to the Eye, discover'd no such danger. When we came near the Westermost Island, which was the biggest of the three, we stood in for the Island; and as we drew nearer, about forty or fifty of their flying Proes came off; in which might be about four hun∣dred and fifty Men, allowing ten to each Proe: And we could see multitudes of people upon the Shore: For as we past by any of these Islands to go to the next, the people also followed us. Their flying Proes lay at a distance from us, and view∣ed us; till we beckoned and made Signs for them to come to us. Then one of them, which was in the midst, advanced towards us; and being pretty near, lay
<PB N="234" REF="278"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> and looked on us for a while. VVe still made Signs for him to draw nearer: Then he came within a Ships length of us, and lay still again. In her were ten Men all naked; and in the midst of them, a grave chearful old Man, of a pleasant Counte∣nance; who had on his Head a four-cor∣nered Cap, without a Crown; but other∣wise he was quite naked, as were all the rest of them. This Man, by the Respect which all the rest in the Boat showed to him, we guessed to be a King or Prince. At their approach to us they sung a Song, which continued about a quarter of an hour: VVe could not understand it, but it was tuned very prettily. VVhen this Song was done, they came almost close to our Vessel's side, and then sung another Song. This was begun by the grave old Man, and followed by all the rest in the Boat. VVhich done, they put themselves in the posture of praying, and made several Bows and Cringes towards us, after the manner of their Country. Then one of the Men in the Boat, having a very sore Leg, held it up to us, and pointed to the VVound: By the Signs he made to us, we understood that he would have us to cure it; for we being white, and they (I believe) having never seen a∣ny white Man before, they seem'd as if they did not think us to be mortal Men.
<PB N="235" REF="279"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> After this, we poured some Water out of a Bucket into a Glass; and pointing to our Mouths, made signs that we wanted Victuals and Drink. Then they shook their Heads, in way of Denial, as I suppose. But seeing us still make towards the Island, one of the Men in the Boat blew a Horn; at the sound of which, all the rest of the Boats made boldly to us. Upon this, we all believing they would be aboard of us, fired a Musket over them; not designing to harm, but only to frighten them: At the noise of which they seemed wonderful∣ly amazed, and drew back; menacing us at a distance with their Paddles, and still following us. So, seeing, as I said before, many hundreds of them upon the shore; and finding we could have nothing from them, but by force; and having no An∣chors or Cables by which we dare trust our Bark; and besides having no Boat to go ashore in; so that should we swim a∣shore, as some of our Men proposed, yet we could not carry our Arms with us; and the <HI>Indians</HI> might knock us on the Head with Stones, whilst we were in the Wa∣ter; we concluded there was no good to be done here. VVherefore examining our VVater, and finding sufficient for eighteen Days at a quart of VVater to each Man <HI>per</HI> Day; we resolved to leave these I∣slands, and to trust to God's Providence
<PB N="236" REF="280"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> to guide us to a more friendly place, where we might supply our wants; not doubting but we should furnish our selves with Water at some Island or other, in a place where there were so many. So we left the said Islands, and called the West∣ermost of them <HI>The Island of Disappoint∣ment,</HI> because we made certain account of getting some Water here, but could not. They were all three, low, flat, even I∣slands; full of several sorts of Trees, all very green and flourishing; And no doubt, if we had had a Boat, we might have met with something which would have been beneficial to our selves, and of advan∣tage to our Country: As we might also at several other small Islands, which we afterwards pass'd by. The Inhabitants of most of these Islands, were a very large strong-bon'd People. They had long black streight Hair, which reached down to their middle; and they all go stark naked, not so much as covering their Privy-parts. I think I never saw such a parcel of large stout-limb'd Fellows together in my Life. We here found a Current setting pretty strongly to the Northward; as it did ever since we left the <HI>Ladrone</HI> Islands.</P>
<P>From these Islands we steered away South West; having a fine fresh Gale of Wind at East. The water here was very foul, being full of Grass and other Trash,
<PB N="237" REF="281"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> which lay driving up and down. VVe sounded several times, but had no Ground at a hundred Fathom; so we still kept on our Course, and kept good look∣ing out all night. The next Morning betimes, being <HI>May</HI> the 8th, we saw the main Land of <HI>New-Guinea,</HI> bearing South by West, distant eighteen or nineteen leagues. And now with a few old broken Boards, which we had in our Vessel, we went to work to build us a small Boat; which afterwards proved very useful to us. The Land was very high and mountain∣ous. At a distance it looked very black; but drawing nearer, it looked more grey. The 9th, we had dirty squally uncertain weather, and the VVinds variable all round the Compass. VVe kept the Coast of <HI>New-Guinea</HI> aboard; and the Land still continued to be of a good height, very full of great high Hills, and small Valleys; which all seemed very barren.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXXIII.</NOTE> It is all a rocky Coast; neither could we perceive a∣ny Harbour, Bay, or place to anchor in. VVhether there be any Inhabitants herea∣bouts, I know not; but vve never savv a∣ny, nor any sign of any, either by Sea in Boats, or upon the Land by Fires or Smokes, as is usual in all inhabited Countries.</P>
<P>The same day vve came abreast of two small Islands; neither of vvhich vvas a∣bove a league in length. They vvere lovv,
<PB N="238" REF="282"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> and very vvell clothed vvith small and green Trees. At the same time we saw also a part of the great Island <HI>Gillolo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXXIII.</NOTE> bearing VVest, distant eight leagues. This vvas also high Land, but not so high as the Coast of <HI>New-Guinea.</HI> We kept on our Course, steering West South West, intend∣ing to go between the Main of <HI>New-Gui∣nea</HI> and the Island <HI>Gillolo;</HI> this being our passage for the <HI>East-Indian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>From the 8th to the 11th, we had dir∣ty Rainy-weather for the most part, with uncertain Gales of Wind; and in the Night, it being dark, and we not keeping the Coast of <HI>New Guinea</HI> so close aboard as we should, we missed the common Pas∣sage, and ran past it; and in the Morning betimes, found our selves amongst a vast number of small Islands: When percei∣ving we had over-shot the Passage, and the Wind being at East, we concluded to look out for a passage to the Southward a∣mongst these Islands. Accordingly we stood to the Southward; but found a great many Rocks and Sholes which stretched from one Island to another: Wherefore at Night, there being little Wind, and not daring to venture further amongst these unfrequented Islands and Sholes; we resolved to lye by all Night: Intend∣ing in the morning, if the Wind should prove Westerly, to return back again and
<PB N="239" REF="283"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> go through the common Passage; but if it still continued Easterly, then to indea∣vour to find out a new Passage to the Westward. This Night we saw two or three Fires, which were made on shore by the Inhabitants. The Islands here were most of them of a good height, and pret∣ty well clothed with several sorts of Trees, which all appeared very green and flou∣rishing. This day we put our selves to a Pint and half of Water a Man <HI>per</HI> day. On the 12th we had fair weather; with a fine fresh Gale at N. E. So we proceeded to the Westward, and at the same time had a strong Tide setting to the Westward. About eight this morning we shot in be∣tween two high Head-lands, which were distant from each other near two Miles. Upon this, some of us went to the Top∣mast-head, to look if we had a clear Pas∣sage through; and we saw not any let or hindrance: So we got through this place by two in the Afternoon. It was in length about seven leagues, and about two Miles broad. In it we could find no Anchor-ground, till within a Ships length of the shore; and then we had thirty fa∣thom Water. The Land here was of an indifferent height, and very woody. At noon the Tide setting back to the East∣ward, and it being calm, we drove by five in the Evening half way back again;
<PB N="240" REF="284"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> and drove with our Vessel so near the shore, that we kept her off with our Poles, and might have stepped from our Bark to the shore; and yet our Vessel never touched the ground, the Water being very deep close to the shore. Not long after, a strong Gale springing up again, by seven in the Evening we got clear out of this streight the second time; and then it fell calm again: And we drove with the Tide, which then set to the Westward. In this streight we saw a flying Proe under Sail, but it did not come near us. We also in some of the small Bays saw several old Houses, some standing, and some half down; but could not see any Inhabitants. On the 13th, we had little wind at E. S. E. and sometimes calm; but when we had any wind, we steered away S. by W. Here we saw a great many Islands to the Southward of us, but none of them so near together but that there vvas room enough to pass between them, and scarce any ground to be found vvith one hundred Fathom of Line. We still found vve got but very little; the Tides setting some∣times to the Southvvard, and then back again to the Northvvard, so that vve vvere not yet got above a league to the South∣vvard of the said streight, vvhich vve, af∣ter the Name of our Bark, called St <HI>Johns</HI> Streighs. And I believe vve vvere the first <HI>Europeans</HI> that ever past it.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="285"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> On the 14th, vve had hazy vveather, vvith small drisling Rain, and little VVind; so that vve vvere not above two leagues further to the Southvvard, than vve vvere the day before. VVe here met vvith a great many small Islands. They vvere most of them of a good height, and very vvoody; but vve could perceive no sign of any Inhabitants. The 16th vve had hazy vveather, vvith fresh Gales of vvind at S. E. by S. and thence to the S. W. by S; so that vve vvere forced to reef our Top-sails: And in the Evening vve savv the Island <HI>Ceram,</HI> bearing South, distant nine leagues: We then steering E. by N. having the wind at S. E. by S. The Island <HI>Ceram</HI> at a distance seemed to be high Land, and looked very black. This day vve finished our Boat vvhich vve vvere building; it vvas tvvelve foot long, and four broad. On the 17th vve had fair vveather, vvith fresh Gales off shore; so that vve vvere forced to stand off and on, as the vvind vvould permit. This day vve savv a Sloop to the Eastward of us, which we vvould very vvillingly have spoken to; But they kept from us, stand∣ing to the Eastvvard along the Coast of <HI>Ceram.</HI> So vve still plyed in for the shore; and at noon savv the Island <HI>Bonoa.</HI> The Island <HI>Bonoa</HI> lyes in the Latitude of about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d. 45 m. South. And it is almost in the
<PB N="242" REF="286"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> shape of a Horse-shooe. We still made towards the Island of <HI>Bonoa;</HI> and on the 18th of <HI>May,</HI> the wind veering about to the E. S. E. and East, we got in. We anchored near the N. W. end of the I∣sland in thirty fathom Water, about a League from the shore. We durst not ven∣ture any nearer in, because of the many Sands and sholes which lye off here. But we sent our little Boat ashore, with two Men, and an empty Hogs-head to be fil∣led with water. When they came ashore, they went up and down seeking for wa∣ter; and after some search, found a small Pond. Here they filled the Hogs-head, and at Night returned on Board. They could not see any Inhabitants; although the Island is very well inhabited. But this North and N. W. side of the Island, is very barren, being nothing but great Rocky Hills, not affording any thing but some small Bushes. This probably might be the reason, that we saw no In∣habitants hereabouts. So that same Night a Laud-wind coming off, and we finding it very inconvenient watering here, because we were forced to lye so far off shore with our Vessel; and our Boat not being able to bring off more than one Hogs-head at a time; we weighed from this place, in∣tending to water upon the Island <HI>Ceram</HI> On the 20th, we got into the Bay of <HI>Ce∣ram;</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="287"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> where we Anchored in twenty five Fathom hard Sand, not above two Ships length from the shore; and sent our little Boat with three Men to look for water. At twelve this Night they returned again, having found out a fine small Spring of fresh water. The next day, it being calm, we got up our Anchor, and rowed our Vessel further in, till we brought the said River to bear S. E, distant about half a Mile, and then anchored in thirty Fathom water, good fast hard Sand; the bearings of the Land being as is represented in the Draught.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXXIV.</NOTE> The Bay here was very woody all round, the Land pretty low, the water pretty deep close to the shore, which was sandy quite round the Bay. From W. S. W. to the S. E. and thence to the N. by VV. the Bay it self is a Defense from those winds; and from the VV. by S. to the W. N. W. the Island of <HI>Bonoa</HI> is a Defense. The Island <HI>Bonoa</HI> is much higher Land than this part of the Island <HI>Ceram.</HI> On the South side it is very well clothed with several sorts of large Trees, and the Valleys are very fruitful in Rice. Also on this South side, it is said to be very well inhabited. We staid in this Bay of <HI>Ceram</HI> till the 22d at Noon; and then having filled eight Tuns of water, and having a fine fresh Gale at S. E, we weighed from <HI>Ceram,</HI> and steered out between <HI>Ceram</HI> and
<PB N="244" REF="288"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> the Island <HI>Bonoa;</HI> but kept nearest the <HI>Ce∣ram</HI> shore. Between these Islands we saw several Proes, and a Sloop. We lay by, and sent our Boat to the Sloop; intend∣ing, if they had any Victuals that they could spare, to buy some of them; But the Sloop made the best of her way, and would not stay for our Boat: So our Boat returned on board again.</P>
<P>At the same time a large <HI>Indian</HI> Proe came on board us; in which was a Free∣man of <HI>Amboyna.</HI> To him we declared our great want of Victuals, having had nothing for a long time to eat, but Flower and Water; and so little of that, as would hardly keep us alive. He told us, if we would go to the Island of <HI>Manipa,</HI> which was then in sight, he would be our Pilot, and carry us in; where he did not doubt but we might have Rice enough for our Money, to carry us to <HI>Batavia.</HI> Accord∣ingly we steered directly for the faid I∣sland of <HI>Manipa;</HI> and in our way passed by the Island <HI>Keylan;</HI> which is a small, but high Island, very well inhabited, and clothed with several sorts of Trees: Its chief product is Rice, and some few Cloves. And here liveth a Dutch Corpo∣ral with six Soldiers, whose only business is to see all the Clove-trees cut down and destroyed. From hence we proceeded to <HI>Manipa,</HI> where we arrived at about twelve
<PB N="245" REF="289"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> at Night, and came to an anchor in a small Bay at the N. W. end of the Island. Then our Dutch Pilot sent two of his Men ashore, with a Letter to the Gover∣nour, to acquaint him with our wants. On the 23d, betimes in the morning, a Dutch Corporal with two Soldiers came on Board, and read to us an Order which he had from the Dutch <HI>East-India</HI> Compa∣ny; that it was not usual for any Ships, except those belonging to the Dutch <HI>East-India</HI> Company, to anchor there; and that if any did, they were not to supply them with any thing. We told him it was through want of Victuals, that we were forced to put in here; and that if we could have subsisted, we should not have touched at any place till our arrival at <HI>Batavia.</HI> Wherefore we desired him to go ashore again, and declare to the Go∣vernour our wants. He seeing us in a very weak condition, promised he would; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that he would bring us word again. Accordingly he went ashore, and at four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Evening returned again, and brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> word that we should have no Provisi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s there; but if we would go to <HI>Amboy∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> there we might be supplyed. So to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great discouragement we were forced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> leave this unfriendly place; intending, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the wind would permit, to go for <HI>Am∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="290"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> The Island <HI>Manipa,</HI> is in length, S. E, and N. W, about fifteen Miles; in breadth, about eight; and lyes in the Latitude of about 3 d. 25 m. South; and Westward of the Island <HI>Bonoa</HI> about 20 Miles. It is a pretty high Island, and very well inhabited by <HI>Malayans;</HI> as are all the <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands. It is shole almost all round; which sholes some of them stretch a league and a half off the shore. Wherefore, unless a Man be acquainted or has good Draughts of the place, it is dangerous coming near it. The Island is of a good height, but not so high as the Island <HI>Keylan</HI> before mentioned. On it are several very good springs of fresh wa∣ter; and on the S. W, side of the Island, the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a small Fort of six Guns. The Island is governed by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ser∣geant, three Corporals, and a Master∣gunner; and they have under them twen∣ty <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers. On it grow abundance of Cloves and Rice, of which they send great quantities to <HI>Amboyna.</HI> The Inhabi∣tants are most of them Fisher-men. They catch abundance of Fish here; not only enough for their own use, but also to sup∣ply <HI>Amboyna</HI> with.</P>
<P>From this place we stood to the South Westward, having the wind at S. S. E And it blowing fresh, we reefed our Top sails. But when we got clear of the I∣sland,
<PB N="247" REF="291"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> it blew so very hard, that we were forced to hand our Top sails, and go a∣way under our courses. We were now quite out of heart: For we did not expect to fetch <HI>Amboyna;</HI> the S. E. Monsoon being set in, which wind was right against us; and besides it blew so hard, that we could scarcely carry any Sail. And we could not think of getting to <HI>Batavia,</HI> be∣cause we had not Victuals to carry us thi∣ther; and besides, as the wind was, we could not weather the sholes, which lye to the E. S. E, of the Island of <HI>Bouton.</HI> So being almost in despair, and the wind continuing, we kept our course to the Southward, till we came over against the Island <HI>Bouro;</HI> and then the wind veering to the S. S. W, we stood away S. E: But finding a strong Current setting to Leeward, so that we rather lost than got ground; and seeing no likelihood of getting to <HI>Amboyna;</HI> we by a general con∣sent shared all that was Eatable on Board our Vessel; and the whole of what each Mans share amounted to, was six Pound and three quarters of Flower, with five Pound of Bran; which how long it was to last, we could not tell; however every one designed to be as sparing of his part, as possibly he could.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="292"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> On the 25th, the wind veering about to the S. S. E, we tackt and stood to the S. W; and soon weathered the Island of <HI>Amblow;</HI> which is a small Island, not above three Leagues in length. It is of an indifferent height, and lyes in the La∣titude of 4 d. 05 m. South. It is pretty well furnished with Trees of several sorts, but not inhabited; neither do I know whether there be any fresh Water upon it. From hence we continued our Course till twelve at night; when a hard Gale of Wind coming down upon us, before we could hand our Sails (by reason of our weakness) it almost overset our Vessel: It split our Man-sail and Main-top-sail all to pieces, broke our Main-stay and two of our Fore-shrowds. We were then stand∣ing away South West, and had the Wind at South South East; intending, if we could weather the Sholes, to put for <HI>Ba∣tavia.</HI> But as soon as the Squall was o∣ver, it fell calm; and then we had so great a Sea, occasioned, as I believe, by the meeting of several Currents, that we thought our Bark could not hold it out. She laboured so much; and the Sea took us so a-head, a-stern, and on both sides, that we were always almost covered with water.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="293"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> On the 26th, sprung up a fine fresh gale at S. E. Whereupon, knowing we could not weather the Sholes, we tack'd and stood away N.

<P>AT our going into the Harbour of <HI>Am∣boyna,</HI> we met with two Ships coming out. These two Ships were laden with Cloves, and bound for <HI>Batavia.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain of one of them came on board of us, and demanded from whence we came, whither bound, and desired we would give him a Journal of our Voyage; promising to return it again, upon our ar∣rival at <HI>Battavia.</HI> We satisfied him to all his demands; and our Agent for the Own∣ers, gave him a small account of our Voy∣age.
<PB N="252" REF="296"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> After which we stood farther in, and the two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships left us. At night the Land-wind coming off, we run in for the Shore, to anchor; but could find no Ground with a hundred fathom of Line, till we came within a Ships length of the Shore; and then we had twenty fathom, hard Sand. Here we lay all night; and the next Morning, (being in our account <HI>Tuesday May</HI> the 28th; but according to the <HI>Dutch</HI> account, <HI>Wednesday;</HI> we having lost about eighteen Hours by our going to the Westward, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> having got six Hours by coming to the Eastward; which makes the difference of time to be 24 hours,) two <HI>Dutch</HI> Orambyes, with 40 Paddles each, came on board of us. They brought the Fiscal Secretary and several <HI>Dutch</HI> Gentle∣men, and about thirty Soldiers, who took possession of our Bark. They also went down and sealed up all our Chests; and the two Orambyes went a-head to tow us in; and by noon we got up as high as the Town, where they moored our Vessel in the common anchoring-place. Here we continued till the 31st, not knowing how they designed to dispose of us. In which time they would not afford us any Victu∣als, although we proffer'd them a Crown for a pound of Beef, Pork, or Bread. In the Evening we were all sent on shore; where they had provided us two Rooms
<PB N="253" REF="297"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> for our Reception, near the State-House; and our Bark, Money and Goods, except what we had about us, were all taken from us; and soon after, our Bark and Goods were sold at a publick Out-cry. We were fed with very bad Meat, which We who had been at spare Diet so long, and our Sto∣machs were very weak, could ill digest. And if we vvould have better, vve must buy it vvith our ovvn Money. Several of us had the good luck to have some Money about us; and as long as that lasted, vve bought our ovvn Victuals of our Keeper. Our <HI>Spanish</HI> Dollar, vvhich was five Shil∣lings and a Penny value, he vvould give us no more than five <HI>Dutch</HI> Skillings for; which was to the value of about Half a Crown; And for this Half-Crown we could have no more Victuals than we might have bought for five Pence, if we had had our liberty to go into the Tovvn. So that instead of ha∣ving five Shillings for our <HI>Spanish</HI> Dollar, we had indeed no more than five Pence.</P>
<P>And now being at a stop for a while at this Island of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> a place often men∣tioned for the Cruelties used towards the <HI>English</HI> here formerly, and having had time and opportunity to enquire into the Manners, Ways, Customs of the People, Strength of the Island, and Product of it; I shall give a small description of it, as far as I observed my self, or could learn of any of the Inha∣bitants, tho' secretly.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> And first, This Island of <HI>Amboyna</HI> is in length North East and South West twelve leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXXV.</NOTE> It is a high mountainous Land; the Hills are somewhat barren, but the Valleys are very fruitful. The Soil is black: and the Surface of it Salt-Petreish. The middle of the Island lies in about 3 d. 40 m. South. It is inhabited by <HI>Ma∣layans,</HI> who are the original Natives. They are of a middle Stature, and tawny; but the Women are of a brighter tawny than the Men, and have long black Hair, which reaches down to the Calfs of their Legs: They have round Faces, small Mouths, Noses and Lips: They wear a Linnen Waste-coat, which reaches no lower than the lower part of their Breasts; and about their middle they were a piece of Cloth, about four Yards wide, and a yard deep; This they roul round them, and it serves them instead of a Petty-coat; For none are allowed to wear Petty-coats but the <HI>Dutch</HI> Women only; Neither are any of the <HI>Malayan</HI> Men allowed to wear a Hat, excepting only their King.</P>
<P>Although the <HI>Malayans</HI> are the most nu∣merous, yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> are possest of all the Sea-Coast; and have here a strong Castle built of Stone, and mounted with sixty Guns; besides several other small Fortifications in other parts of the Island. Near this Castle, is a small Town, of

<PB N="255" REF="300"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> about a hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> Houses, all well and strongly built of Stone, Brick and Timber; but all very low, none exceed∣ing one Story, because of the many Earth∣quakes to which this place is very subject; so that should they be built higher, it would endanger the falling of them; as they often do, notwithstanding they are so low. Whilst we were here, we had a great Earthquake, which continued two Days; in which time it did a great deal of Mischief: For the Ground burst open in many places, and swallowed up several Houses and whole Families. Several of the People were dug out again, but most of them dead; and many had their Legs or Arms broke by the fall of Houses. The Castle-walls were rent asunder in several Places; and we thought that It and all the Houses would have fallen down. The Ground where we were, swell'd like a Wave in the Sea; but near us we had no hurt done.</P>
<P>The Island is govern'd by a Council, which consists of five Persons, <HI>viz.</HI> the Governour, the Chief Merchant (or upper Koop-man,) the <HI>Malayan</HI> King, the Cap∣tain of the Fort, and the Fiscal, who is in the Nature of a Judge. Upon the Island are said to be about 350 <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers, with about 120 or 130 <HI>Dutch</HI> Free-men and Petty-Officers, and near as many
<PB N="256" REF="301"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> <HI>Chinese,</HI> who live here for the advantage of Trade; although they are not allowed to trade in Spice, that being a peculiar Trade which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company reserve to themselves. So that I reckon they can make in all about five hundred and fifty fighting Men, <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Chinese:</HI> As for the <HI>Malayans,</HI> they would be of little Service to them, but rather be glad to be assistant to any Body against them. The <HI>Malayan</HI> Women here, are said to be great Whores; of which they are no∣thing ashamed. They are soon ripe, and often marry by nine Years of Age; and many of them are said to have Children by ten or eleven. All near the Water-side are forced to be under the <HI>Dutch</HI> Govern∣ment, which is very Absolute and Tyran∣nick over them. For any small Fault they are severely handled; and many think themselves well, if they are not made Slaves, and to wear an Iron upon their Leg during Life. Those, I say, which dwell near the Sea-side, are all subject to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Government, and are Chri∣stians: But those within the Country, which are called the Hill-<HI>Malayans,</HI> are Mahometans. They are always at War with the <HI>Dutch:</HI> And if they take one of them Prisoner at any time; they never give him any quarter; but after they have kept him in Prison five Days without either
<PB N="257" REF="302"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> Victuals or Drink, they bring him out, and first of all rip up his Breast with a sharp Knife and take out his Heart; at which there is great rejoycing of all the <HI>Malayans</HI> that are present. Then they cut off his Head, and embalm it with Spice to keep; And they who can show most of such Heads, are accounted the most honourable, and value themselves much upon it. The dead Body is left ex∣posed to the ravenous Birds of Prey to feed on. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> to retaliate this u∣sage, when they take any of these <HI>Ma∣layans,</HI> lade them with many Irons, and lay them in Prison, where they continue some time; After which they cut off their Noses and Ears; and then they are sent to Prison again, where they continue some further time: After which they are brought out the second and last time, and they rack them till they die.</P>
<P>As for those under their own Govern∣ment; if they are found guilty of thieving, they often cut off their Noses and Ears, and put a great Iron Chain upon their Legs, and so make them Slaves during Life. There were near five hundred of these poor Wretches, who were in conti∣nual Slavery whilst we were here; and they always took care to keep them em∣ployed; some in sawing of Timber, others in cutting of Stone; some in carrying of

<PB N="258" REF="305"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> Burthens, and other labour. At Sun-rising every Morning they are let out of the Prison, in which they are kept, the Men in one, and the Women in another; and are immediately sent to work; where they continue till twelve at Noon; at which time they return back, and have an Hours time to dine: Their Dinner is always the same, being nothing but a Pint of course Rice boiled for each Man. At One they are sent to work again; where they con∣tinue till six in the Evening; at which time they return again, and go to Supper, which is always the same both in quanti∣ty and quality, as at dinner. Soon after they have supp'd, they are put into their Lodgings, and lock'd in; where they lie upon the bare Boards; and have seldom any thing but a large piece of Wood, which commonly serves five or six of them for a Pillow. Sometimes these poor Wretches make shift to escape; but if they are caught again, they are sure to be se∣verely handled. There was One of these poor Slaves, a Woman, who had been se∣verely used by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and having once made her escape, and being taken again; she, knowing how severely she should be used, cut her own Throat, the Day before her appointed Punishment: After which she was by the Hair dragged out of the Prison all round the Town
<PB N="259" REF="306"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> and then hung upon a Gibbet by her Feet, with her Head down-wards; which is the common Punishment for any that are guilty of Self-murther.</P>
<P>Such as are in Debt, and cannot satisfie their Creditors, the Creditors turn over to the Company; who send them to work amongst their Slaves. They have nothing allowed them, but Rice and Water, as the other Slaves; only they have two-pence a Day given them towards the Payment of their Debts; which avails but little: So that it is very seldom, if ever, that a∣ny one gets out, till he is carried out dead.</P>
<P>But though the poor Natives are thus severely handled; yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> them∣selves will wink at one anothers Faults; so that it is a great Rarity for any one of them to be punished, unless it be for Mur∣ther. Otherwise a small matter of Mo∣ney will buy off a great Fault.</P>
<P>The Women that are Slaves to the Free-men, have all the liberty that may be, from their Masters and Mistresses; only they are obliged every Night to bring them a certain Acknowledgement, which is commonly about six-pence a Day; and to find their own Victuals, Cloths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In default of which, they are severely used. They may whore and Deal, and all is well; if the dayly Ac∣knowledgment
<PB N="260" REF="307"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> be but brought, and no Complaint be made against them.</P>
<P>The chief of what this Island produces, is Cloves, Ginger, Pepper, Rattans, Cams, and some few Nut-megs.</P>
<P>The Clove-Tree is not very great of Body, but rather slender. It is in length from twelve to thirty or forty foot. The Branches are small; the Leaves about five Inches long, and two broad; and end tapering. One of these Leaves rubb'd be∣tween the Fingers, will smell very strong of Cloves; but without rubbing they have no smell at all. The Cloves grow just at the tip of the Branches; ten, twelve or fourteen in a Cluster. They are first white, then green, then of a dark Copper-colour; which is the time of their being ripe. The manner of gathering them, is to spread Cloths or Sheets round the bottom of the Tree, for a good distance. Then they shake the Tree; and all the Cloves that are throughly ripe and fit to be ga∣thered, fall down. The rest which are left upon the Tree, they let hang for about six or seven Days. Then they shake as many more of them off, as are ripe and will fall. This they do three, four, or five times; till they are all down. The usual time of gathering of them, is in <HI>Octo∣ber</HI> and <HI>February.</HI> Those which are ripe in <HI>October,</HI> are called the Winter Clove;
<PB N="261" REF="308"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> this being the end of their Winter; and they are not accounted so good or strong as the other. These they commonly preserve and put up in small Jarrs, of about a quart; of which they transport great quan∣tities to several parts of the World. Those which are ripe in <HI>February,</HI> are called the Summer-Clove: These are accounted much better and stronger than the former; be∣cause these have the best part of the Sum∣mer to ripen in; whereas the former have not above a Months fair Weather, and all the rest is rainy and cloudy, so that the Rays of the Sun cannot come to them. It is the common receiv'd Opinion, that Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace and Cinamon, grow all upon one Tree; but it is a great mistake. These Trees commonly bear sixty, seventy, or eighty pound weight at a time; and every six Years they are sure to have a double Crop. There is a vast number of these Trees upon this Island; which are very carefully looked after, and a Register kept of them in the Company's Book. They are numbred once every Year; and beyond a certain number they will not let them encrease, but cut them down and destroy them for fear of lessen∣ning the Price. All these Trees belong to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company, or to their Freemen: But those that belong to the Free-men, the Company sets them an allowance as to
<PB N="262" REF="309"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> their number: And if any one rears up more than what the Company allows of, he is severely fined, and his Trees forfeited. And whatsoever Cloves, the Trees belonging to Free-men produce, the Freemen are obli∣ged to sell to the Company, after the rate of 6 <HI>d.</HI> a pound. So that properly all the Cloves upon the Island are ingrossed into the Companies Hands; And if any Free∣man or other sells or conveys away to the value of ten pounds; all that he has in the World is forfeited to the Company, and he to be made a Slave during Life. The Inhabitants used formerly to put Cheats upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the Sale of their Cloves; for it was common with them to put their Cloves in a large Sheet, which they hung up by its four Corners under the Cieling of their House; and upon the Floor, right under the Cloves, they would set a large Tub of fresh Water; which the Cloves, being very dry and of a hot Nature, would by degrees draw up, and make a large addition to their weight, without being easily perceived: But now the <HI>Dutch</HI> are grown too cunning for them; For they always try them by giving them a small fillip with their Fore-finger on the Head; and then, if the Clove be throughly ripe, and no Deceit has been used, the Head will break all in pieces like a piece of thin brittle Glass: But if it has been wetted,
<PB N="263" REF="310"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> then the Clove will be very tough; and the whole Clove will sooner bend, than the Head fly off.</P>
<P>There are some few Nut-megs upon this Island; the Trees of which are much like the Peach. But they grow mostly at the Island <HI>Banda:</HI> From whence two or three Ship-loads are exported every Year. The Fruit of this Tree consists of four Parts; the first and outward Rind, is like that of a green Wal-nut; the second is dry and thin, which we call Mace; the third is a tough thin Shell, like that of a Chesnut; and the fourth is the Kernel included in the said Shell, which we call Nut-meg.</P>
<P>There are said to be upon this Island some Mines of Gold. One of the <HI>Malayans</HI> showed me some of the Ore, which he said was taken out of them: But this he said was a great Crime; and if the <HI>Dutch</HI> should know it, he should be severe∣ly punished: For this is an extraordinary Secret, which, as much as they can, they keep from all <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>Although, as I said before, they can raise about five hundred and fifty fighting Men upon this Island; yet once every Year they are forced to spare a great many of their People, which are sent away up∣on other Businesses. For commonly on the 20th of <HI>October</HI> each Year, eight or ten Days sooner or later, the Governour
<PB N="264" REF="311"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> of this place goes his Progress, attended with about seventy five Orambies, some with a hundred, some eighty, some fifty, and some forty Paddles a-piece: In each of which go two <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers. I reckon there may be in this whole Fleet, of <HI>Dutch</HI> about 150 or 160, and about 5250 <HI>Ma∣layans,</HI> reckoning seventy <HI>Malayans</HI> to each Oramby, one with another. These seventy-five Orambies are divided into three Squadrons: The first consisting of twenty Orambies; which Squadron is always commanded by one of the Council, who carries a yellow Flag: The Rear consists of twenty more, and is commanded by the Fiscall, who commonly carries a red Flag: The rest are in the middle Squadron, and attend the Governour, who hath twelve <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers, a Corporal and a Serjeant for his Body-guard, and carries a blew Flag. The Governour carries with him the <HI>Indian</HI> King, and all their Princes, for fear they should rebel in his Absence. In this Order they go and visit all these Ea∣stern Islands, but especially those that do or would produce Cloves or Nut-megs. And at every Island they go to, they have an additional strength. The time of their cruizing in this manner, is commonly six Weeks; in which time they cut down, burn and destroy all the Clove and Nut∣meg Trees they can find, excepting such as
<PB N="265" REF="312"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> are reserved for the Companies use. For all or most of these Islands do or would produce Cloves; But they will not suffer them, because they have enough to supply all <HI>Europe</HI> at <HI>Amboyna</HI> alone; and even there also, as I said before, they will per∣mit but a certain number, least a Plenty of them should lower the price. Upon all these Islands the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company keeps Soldiers, three, six, nine or twelve, ac∣cording as they are in bigness; Whose on∣ly business it is to see the Trees cut down, or at least to take care they do not en∣crease: For they are very jealous least the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>French</HI> should serve them such a Trick, as they themselves formerly served the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Amboyna.</HI> During the time of their thus cruizing, they gather Tribute from all the petty Kings and Princes of these Islands; and commonly at the end of about six Weeks, return again.</P>
<P>Of Beasts here are several sorts, as Beeves, Hogs, wild Deer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of Fowls here are also several sorts, as the <HI>Crocka∣dore,</HI> the <HI>Cassawaris,</HI> the <HI>Bird of Para∣dice, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Crockadore</HI> is a Bird of various si∣zes; some being as big as a Hen, and others no bigger than a Pidgeon. They are in all parts exactly of the shape of a Parrot. Their Feathers are all over white, excepting only a Bunch upon their Head,
<PB N="266" REF="313"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> which is always either yellow or red. This Bunch of Feathers lies so close fitted into a dent in the Head, that they can∣not be perceived, unless when the Bird is frighted; and then he sets it up an end, and it spreads open like a Fan. The Flesh and Legs of this Bird are quite black; and they smell very sweet. When thy fly wild up and down the Woods, they will call <HI>Crockadore, Crockadore;</HI> for which reason they go by that name.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cassawaris</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXXVI.</NOTE> is about the bigness of a large <HI>Virginia</HI> Turkey. His Head is the same as a Turkeys; and he has a long stiff hairy Beard upon his Breast before, like a Turkey. He hath two great Legs, almost as thick as a Man's Wrist; with five great Claws upon each Foot: He has a high round Back; and instead of Feathers only long Hairs; and the same upon the Pini∣ons of his Wings. It lays an Egg so big that it will hold a Pint. The Shell is pret∣ty thick, spotted with green and white, and looks exactly like China-ware. I ne∣ver tasted the Eggs, but the Bird it self is extraordinary good Victuals, as I have tried several times. It tastes very like a Turkey, but much stronger.</P>
<P>The <HI>Birds of Paradice</HI> are about the bigness of a Pidgeon. They are of vari∣ous Colours, and are never found or seen alive; neither is it known from whence

<PB N="267" REF="315"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> they come. I have seen several of them here embalm'd with Spice, which preserves them from decay; And so embalm'd they are sent as Rarities to several parts of the World. It is related of these Birds, that when the Nutmegs are ripe, which is in the Months of <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> they resort to the Places where they grow, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>Banda</HI> and this place, and eat off the outer-rind of the Nut: After which they fall down dead drunk, and an innumerable Company of Ants gather about them and feed upon them, and kill them.</P>
<P>Of Fish here are also several sorts; but the most noted is the <HI>Sea-Porcupine:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. XXXVII.</NOTE> It is in length about three foot, and two foot and a half round. It has a very large Eye; with two Fins on his Back, and one large one on each side near his Gills. It is very full of sharp-pointed Quills, (which are hard stiff Bones,) and from thence is called the <HI>Sea-Porcupine.</HI></P>
<P>Of Fruits here are Plantains, Bonanoes, Pine-Apples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Pine-Apple grows upon a low shrub, with prickly Leaves. They are so big, that they will commonly weigh two pound, and two pound and a half. When it is ripe, it is yellow and red without, and full of little Bunches; within it is yellow, and so juicy, that when you bite it, the Juice will run down your Chin and Clothes; and the Li∣quor
<PB N="268" REF="316"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> is very cool and pleasant. Before they eat it, they commonly rub it well with Salt, and so let it lye for about an Hour, which takes away the rawness of it; then they wash it in fresh Water, and eat it. But One is sufficient for two or three People: For they are very apt to cause Feavers.</P>
<P>Here is also another sort of Fruit, called a <HI>Mangoe.</HI> It is about the bigness of our common Cucumber. The out-side, altho' ripe, looks green; and within, it is very yellow. It is a very delicious Fruit, when ripe; and has a fine fragrant smell. When they are green, they cut them in two pieces, which they pickle and send to most parts of the World. They grow upon a Tree about the bigness of our common Apple-tree.</P>
<P>This Island of <HI>Amboyna</HI> is sandy all round; but the Water is so deep, that there is no anchoring near it, but at the <HI>Ley,</HI> (which is at the West-end of the Island,) in forty fathom Water close to the shore; and in the common Harbour. This Harbour runs up a great way into the Island, and almost divides it into two Parts, so that they are almost two Islands, being only joined by a small Neck of Land, so narrow, that the <HI>Malayans</HI> often haul their Canoas over. At the entrance into the Harbour, on the East-side, there
<PB N="269" REF="317"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> is a small Fortification, of about six Guns, and close to it is twenty fathom Water; And about a league further up, is the Har∣bour for Ships, where they lie under the Command of their great Castle, which ever since the Massacre of the <HI>English</HI> has been called the Castle <HI>Victoria.</HI></P>
<P>About two Miles further to the North East, within the Harbour, is the place where formerly our <HI>English</HI> Factory was settled; and near it is said to be the Hole, into which all the <HI>English</HI> were thrown, after they had been massacred by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> There were few of us now here, but expected the same Fate; and some of the Inhabitants were no way shy to tell us, that the Journal which was sent in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships that we met going out hence for <HI>Batavia,</HI> was our Protection. For they were sensible that upon those Ships arrival at <HI>Batavia,</HI> it would be presently known that a part of Captain <HI>Dampier</HI>'s Company was arrived at <HI>Amboyna;</HI> and from thence it would spread all over <HI>India;</HI> and so they knew, if we fared otherwise than well, we should be enquired after.</P>
<P>A little to the Eastward of this Island, are several other small Islands; the most noted and biggest of which, are <HI>Boangbessey</HI> and <HI>Hinomoa.</HI> They lie East from <HI>Am∣boyna</HI> at a small distance. They are of an indifferent height, and not above a third
<PB N="270" REF="318"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> part so big as the Island of <HI>Amboyna.</HI> They are both pretty well fortified, and produce store of Cloves: But the chief place for Nut-megs, is the Island of <HI>Banda,</HI> which also belongs to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> It lies in the Latitude of 4d. 20m. South, and bears from <HI>Amboyna</HI> E. S. E. distance 28 Leagues. The Island is said to be in form of a Man's Foot and Leg; and to be pret∣ty well fortified: And as it has the pre∣heminence for Nut-megs, so <HI>Amboyna</HI> has for Cloves.</P>
<P>The Governour of <HI>Amboyna</HI> is reckoned the Chief and Head-Governour of all these Spice-Islands, even to <HI>Ternate</HI> and <HI>Tidore,</HI> which are also Spice-Islands in possession of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and lie about forty Miles to the Northward of the Equator.</P>
<P>Whilst we were at this Island of <HI>Amboy∣na,</HI> we were so much troubled with Mos∣kitoes, (which are a sort of Gnats,) that every Night we were forced to put our selves in a Bag, before we could go to sleep; for otherwise these Creatures would so bite us, that there was no sleep∣ing: And whereever they bite, they com∣monly raised a red Blister, almost as broad as a Silver-penny: This would itch very much, and many could not forbear scrat∣ching themselves so, as to cause Inflamma∣tions, which sometimes are the cause of the loss of a Limb.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="319"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> During our stay here, we had the liberty of a broad paved Yard, about sixty Yards square; but by no means would they let us go out into the Town; being very jea∣lous of us, and desirous to prevent (as much as they could) our knowing their Strength, or making any other Discoveries which they thought might be prejudicial to them.</P>
<P>Here we remained from the 31st of <HI>May</HI> to the 14th of <HI>September</HI> 1705. At which time there being three of the Companies Sloops ready to sail hence, laden with Cloves; twenty five of our Men were sent away with them for <HI>Batavia;</HI> and we were ten of us left behind, who were (as they said) to go in another Vessel, which was almost ready to sail.</P>
<P>It was very observable, that all the time of our being here, none of us fell sick or died. For this was the S. E. or bad Monsoon, which begins in the latter end of <HI>April,</HI> and lasts till the latter end of <HI>September;</HI> Most of which time, we had hard Storms of Wind; with much Thun∣der, Lightning and Rain; and the Wea∣ther so very cloudy, that for six or seven Days together we saw not the Sun. The greatest violence of this Weather, is in <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>August;</HI> and then it abates, and at the latter end of <HI>September</HI> quite breaks up; And then begins the westerly
<PB N="272" REF="320"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> Monsoon, which is fine fair clear Wea∣ther, with gentle Gales, variable, but mostly inclining to be Westerly. This is counted the healthy Monsoon; and the other the sickly one: For in the Easterly Monsoon the Inhabitants are very much troubled with Feavers and Fluxes, of which a great many die; as vast numbers did whilst we were here; especially of the <HI>Malayan</HI> Inhabitants, who are more apt to die of them than the <HI>Dutch;</HI> but I suppose the reason is, because they are not so well provided with Doctors and Medicines as the <HI>Dutch;</HI> neither are they so well looked after. They admired at us, seeing we were fed with such bad Diet, and but newly come from Sea very weak, that we could bear up under so many Hardships and Inconveniences; and it used to be their common Saying, <HI>That nothing of Hardships or sickly Places would kill the</HI> English, <HI>so long as they had any Victuals to eat.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason why I have given so little account of the Winds and Seasons of the Year in this whole Voyage, is because these things are so well described in Capt. <HI>Dampier</HI>'s 2d Volume; But he not having spoken much of these <HI>Moluccoes</HI> or Spice-Islands, I have therefore endeavoured to give the more particular Account of them.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="321"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> On the 27th of <HI>September</HI> a <HI>Malayan</HI> Man was brought in here at <HI>Amboyna</HI> to the State-house to be tryed for his Life. He was accused by his own Wife, for murthering his Slave. The Slave had been dead about six Months, and she had concealed it; but happening to fall out with her Husband, she went before the Fiscal in the Heat of her Anger, and declared it. So her Husband was put in Prison, and the Corps of the dead Slave dug up: But it being consumed and rotten, no Marks of any Violence could be perceived upon it; and it was generally believed that the Man's Wife accused him wrongfully. He was upon his Tryal when the Earthquake happened. At which time I observed, that it is a common Error to suppose that during an Earthquake it is always calm. For we had a fine fresh Gale at S. S. W. both Days on which the Earthquake hap∣pened. This Earthquake made all the Court break up, being in fear the House would fall on their Heads. So the Man was com∣mitted to Prison again; and the next Day, being <HI>September</HI> the 28th, about 11 at Noon, the Court being set again, the Man was again brought to his Tryal; when in about a quarter of an Hour, when his Wife was in her greatest violence against him, the Earth shook very much again, and caused them all to break up
<PB N="274" REF="322"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> the second time. The same Day my self with four more of our Men, were sent on board a <HI>China</HI>-Sloop for <HI>Batavia.</HI> How they proceeded further with the Man, I know not; But many thought it a great token of his Innocency, that the two several Earthquakes happened the two several Days just at the time of his Trial. The other five of our Men, which were left behind, they promised should be sent af∣ter us in a short time; but we never heard of them after.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM <HI>Amboyna</HI> we steered away S. W. by W. till we came to the Island <HI>Lancas;</HI> and in our way passed by the Island <HI>Amblow,</HI> of which I have already spoken. The Island <HI>Lancas</HI> is a short low Island, on which is store of Wood. It is not inhabited; and all round it, for a good distance, is said to be shole Water. It lies in the Latitude of 5 d. 27 m. South; and I made Meridian distance ftom <HI>Amboy∣na</HI> 155 Miles, or 2 d. 35. m. West.</P>
<P>From hence we steered W. by N. for a small time, till we came up with the two Islands <HI>Cabeses.</HI> Where it falling calm, we sent our Boat ashore to the Eastermost of them, and cut down some Hundreds of Coco-nuts, which we carried on board. This was also a low Island, not inhabited, but all round full of Coco-nut-trees, which are planted here on purpose for the use
<PB N="277" REF="325"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> of such <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships and Vessels as pass by here for <HI>Batavia.</HI> For it is a great Rarity to see any <HI>European</HI> shipping here, besides the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Off this Island we met our Bark, which had brought us from <HI>America</HI> to <HI>Amboyna.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> after they had taken her from us, fitted her up, put a Mizen-Mast in, and made a very good Ves∣sel of her. This Island lies in the Latitude of 5 d. 23 m. South; and nearly W. by N. from the Island <HI>Lancas,</HI> distance about 45 Miles: It is shole two Miles from the Shore. To the S. W. of this, is the other Island of <HI>Cabeses,</HI> which is a pretty high Island, and upon it the <HI>Dutch</HI> always keep six Sol∣diers and a Corporal, who two or three times a Year go round the Island to see that no Cloves be planted; and if there be, they cut them down and burn them, for fear least any other Nation should take it from them; which if they should, I am apt to believe <HI>Amboyna</HI> would be of little use to them; Cloves being the only Pro∣duct valuable upon it.</P>
<P>From hence we passed by the South-part of the Island <HI>Bouton,</HI> which lies in the La∣titude of 5 d. 45 m. South. It is a pretty large Island, taking up above a degree and half in Latitude.</P>
<P>From hence we steered to the West∣ward, and passed between the Island <HI>Ce∣lebes</HI> and the Island <HI>Zalayer.</HI> The South-part
<PB N="278" REF="326"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> of the Island <HI>Celebes,</HI> is very high Land. It is very well inhabited, and is a very large Island, taking up seven de∣grees in Latitude. At the South-end of this Island, on the West-side, the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Factory, called <HI>Macasser,</HI> where they have a Fort of about seventy Guns, mann'd with six or seven hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers. The chief Product of the Place, is Rice; with which they supply all or most of their Eastern Islands. Here are also said to be several Gold-mines, of which the <HI>Dutch</HI> are not yet masters. For the Inha∣bitants are often at War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and pretty well defend those Places.</P>
<P>Between the South-end of the Island <HI>Celebes,</HI> and the Island <HI>Zalayer,</HI> are three small low Islands; and the best Passage, is between that which lies next to the Island <HI>Zalayer,</HI> and a little small one which lies to the Northward of That. This is called the second Passage from <HI>Zalayer,</HI> and is accounted the best; For in the first Passage from <HI>Zalayer,</HI> are many sholes, but in this second it is deep Water: The third and fourth are also deep; but if you go through with the Sea-wind, you will be so nigh the shore of <HI>Celebes,</HI> that you must be forced to anchor till the Land-wind comes: Wherefore the second is al∣ways accounted the best Passage; and most Ships, rather than go through the first,
<PB N="279" REF="327"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> third or fourth, will lie a whole Day to go through the second; which they do as commonly in the Night, as in the Day, there being no danger.</P>
<P>The Island <HI>Zalayer</HI> is of a moderate height. It is inhabited by <HI>Malayans,</HI> and planted all round with Coco-nut-trees. The Inhabitants are forced yearly to send store of Oil and Match to the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Macasser,</HI> as a Tribute.</P>
<P>From hence we steered W. by N. (ha∣ving had the Wind in the Eastern Quar∣ter ever since we left <HI>Amboyna,</HI>) till we had passed a dangerous shole called the <HI>Brill;</HI> and then we haul'd up S. W. and in the Night saw a small Island just by us; which finding we could not weather, we tack'd and stood the other way till Day-light; and then finding our selves to the Southward of the said Island, we tackt and stood to the South-westward; and soon after saw two other small low Islands, bearing from the North to the North-west. We could see the Ground very plain for about two Miles; and never had above six, or under five fathom Water, though it looked as if there was not above two fathom. We came over this shole about a league to the Southward of the said two small Islands; and this is accounted the narrowest part of the Shole; for further to the Southward it is five or six Leagues
<PB N="280" REF="328"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> over: But There also there is no danger, because you have very even Soundings, as five or six fathom, seldom over or un∣der. But to the Northward of these two Islands, it is very dangerous; it being all very foul rocky Ground, and in some places not above four or five foot Water. Therefore be sure to go to the Southward of these Islands, and you will be safe: Al∣though the <HI>Dutch</HI> in most of their Maps, (unless in such as they give to their own People,) have laid down the Dangers to the Southward, which should have been laid down to the Northward of the two Islands: And the safe sholes, which we and they always go over, they have laid down to the Northward of the two Islands; whereas we and they also went over to the Southward of them. We had a Draught on board belonging to the Cap∣tain of the Vessel, which showed all this very exactly as we found it. I compared it with several others which were on board, and found a great deal of Diffe∣rence. I asked the Captain the reason of their Difference; and he told me that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> knew all the sholes and dangerous places hereabouts very well; but did not desire that any Body else should know them. So that if any Fo∣reigner should come into these Parts a∣mongst these sholes, and sail by their
<PB N="281" REF="329"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> Draughts; they, thinking all safe, might unexpectedly be amongst Rocks and Sholes, where they would certainly lose their Ship; as we had done, if we had sailed by the common Draughts. It being the <HI>Dutch</HI> Policy, to keep all Ships belonging to the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> as far off these Eastern Islands, as they can; or at least if any do chance to come amongst them, and happen into their Hands, as we did; to take care to send them away from a∣mong them, and to let them know as lit∣tle of them as may be.</P>
<P>On the 16th of <HI>October</HI> we passed by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory, called <HI>Rambang;</HI> and on the 21st, arrived in the Harbour of <HI>Bata∣via.</HI> Here we were sent ashore to the Bomb-Key, to the rest of our Men, who had been sent hither before, and were not yet cleared. And soon after, the Major of the Castle was sent to us, and desired we would send to the General by him an Account of our Losses and Damages, which we received by our being taken at <HI>Amboyna;</HI> and that we should be satisfied upon all Accounts, both as to our lost Things, loss of Time, and Imprisonment. Accordingly we each of us drew up an account of our Losses, and sent it by the Major to the General, who return'd us answer, that very speedily we should have Satisfaction and our Freedom. On the
<PB N="282" REF="330"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> 27th of <HI>October</HI> we were all sent for to the Fort, and most of our ready Money was return'd to us again; but for our Goods, loss of Time, and Imprisonment, we could have no Satisfaction. Only the General told us he had given us all that the Gover∣nour of <HI>Amboyna</HI> had sent to him; and that if there was any thing more, he knew nothing of it; and that we were now at our liberty to go where we pleased. We desired, that since our Vessel was taken from us by the Company, (of which He was the Head,) he would be pleased to take care to find us some Ship in which we might return home; which he promi∣sed he would. We were forced to be con∣tent; and went and took Lodgings in the Town, till we could meet with an oppor∣tunity of returning home.</P>
<P>And now being at a stop here for a while, I shall give some Description of this North Coast of <HI>Java.</HI> The Island is in length East and West about ten De∣grees. And from the East end of <HI>Madu∣ra</HI> to this Port of <HI>Batavia,</HI> you have the common Land and Sea Winds. In the Easterly Monsoon the Land-winds are at South East, sometimes more Southerly; and the Sea-winds at North East, fine pleasant Gales. This Easterly Monsoon is account∣ed the good Monsoon; it being fine fair clear Weather, beginning in <HI>April,</HI> and
<PB N="283" REF="331"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> ending in <HI>October:</HI> But the Westerly Mon∣soon is called the bad Monsoon, being rai∣ny and blustering weather, with much Thunder and Lighting, especially in <HI>De∣cember, January</HI> and <HI>February.</HI> This bad Monsoon begins in <HI>November,</HI> and ends in <HI>March,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>April.</HI> In it the Land-winds are at West South West and South West, and the Sea-winds at North West and West North West. The Anchor-ground all along the North side of <HI>Java,</HI> from the Island <HI>Madura</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> is brave oazey Ground, and clear of Rocks. The principal places on this side of the I∣sland, are <HI>Batavia, Bantam, Japara, Sa∣marang, Surabon, Taggall,</HI> the <HI>Quale</HI> and <HI>Rambang.</HI> All these places are settled by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> They afford Rice, with which they supply all their Out-factories herea∣bouts; as also very good Plank, to build Shipping with. The chief place of build∣ing is <HI>Rambang;</HI> where the Freemen go to build their small Vessels, as Sloops and Brigantines. Also several Ships of five, six, or seven hundred Tuns, lade with Timber at <HI>Rambang,</HI> the <HI>Quale, Japa∣ra,</HI> &amp;c. And each Ship, when full, ta∣keth a great Raft of the largest of the Timber in a tow to <HI>Batavia.</HI> Some of these Rafts are said to be thirty foot square, and to draw twenty-two foot wa∣ter. There are commonly fix of these
<PB N="284" REF="332"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> Ships, which thus lade with Timber; and they commonly make four Voyages in the good Monsoon: For in the bad, they can∣not do any thing. All this Timber is com∣monly landed upon a small Island between four and five leagues from <HI>Batavia;</HI> where the Ship-Carpenters are usually kept at work; nay, they are said to be never out of Employ. They are about two hundred in number; and the Island is called <HI>Ʋn∣rest;</HI> a very fit name for it; for here is said to be no rest for an idle person. The <HI>Dutch</HI> careen all their Ships here; and it is very well fortified, being all round a Bed of Guns.</P>
<P><HI>Batavia</HI> is the chief place the <HI>Dutch</HI> have in <HI>India;</HI> receiving by Shipping, the Product of <HI>India, Japan,</HI> and <HI>China.</HI> It is inhabited by several sorts of people; as <HI>Dutch, Portuguese, Chinese, Persians</HI> and <HI>Negroes;</HI> but the <HI>Malayans</HI> are the Na∣tives. The <HI>Dutch</HI> are Masters of the place, and have a very fine large Town, in which are seven Churches, <HI>Dutch, Por∣tuguese, Malays</HI> and <HI>Chinese;</HI> with several very fine spacious Houses, built after the European manner. The Town is all wal∣led, and moted round; and upon the Walls are planted store of Cannon. In the middle of the Town, in a great square place, is a very sine and handsome State∣house, where all Affairs are transacted.
<PB N="285" REF="333"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> The Town, with all the Fortifications, is commonly governed by one of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> who has the Title of Gene∣ral of <HI>India;</HI> and all other Governours are subordinate to him. The Inhabitants here, do not care how often they change their General; For at the coming of a new one, all Prisoners are released, ex∣cepting such as have committed murther. He has twelve to assist him, who have al∣ways the Title of <HI>Raids</HI> or Lords of <HI>In∣dia.</HI> These are such as have been former∣ly chief Governours in several places in <HI>India;</HI> as of <HI>Ceylon, Amboyna, Malacca,</HI> &amp;c. The Town is divided by Rivers; o∣ver which, almost in every Street, there are Bridges laid, and Bombs to haul a∣cross; which let no Boats go in or out af∣ter Sun-set.</P>
<P>At this place grows the <HI>Tamarind-Tree,</HI> whose Leaves shut and open according to the rising and setting of the Sun. And much like this is another Tree, that buds in the night; and as the Sun rises, blooms a Flower almost like a Lilly; So that the Tree will be full of these Flowers by noon; and when the Sun is down, with∣in half an hour, the Flowers will be all fallen off, and not one left upon the Tree. This I have seen daily.</P>
<P>The chief Product of the place is Pep∣per; of which the <HI>Dutch</HI> yearly export
<PB N="286" REF="334"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> great Quantities. Here are also some few Diamonds, and other rich Gems.</P>
<P>Of Fruits, here are Plantains, Bona∣noes, Oranges, Lemons, Pomegranates, Mangastans and Rumbostans.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mangastan,</HI> is about the bigness of a Golden-Runnet. It is quite round, and looks like a small Pomegranate. The out∣side Rind is like that of a Pomegranate, on∣ly of a darker colour; But the inside of the Rind is of a fine red. Within this Rind is the Fruit, which is of a fine white, and lies in Cloves almost like Garlick. There are commonly four or five of these Cloves in each; and they are very soft and juicy. Within the Cloves is a small black Stone. We commonly suck the Fruit from the Stone: And the Fruit is very delicious; the Stone we throw away, being very bit∣ter if chewed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rumbostan</HI> is about the bigness of a Walnut, when the green Peel is off. It is also much of the shape of the Walnut; And hath a prety thick tough outer-rind, which is of a deep red, and is full of little knobs of the same colour. Within the Rind is the Fruit, which is quite white, and looks almost like a Jelly: And with∣in the Fruit is a large Stone. It is very delicate Fruit; and though a Man eat ne∣ver so much, yet it never does him any harm; provided he swallows the Stones
<PB N="287" REF="335"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> as well as the Fruit: But otherways they are said to cause Fevers.</P>
<P>But this place is so well known to most Europeans, that it needs no further Description.</P>
<P>On the second of <HI>December,</HI> all of us which had a desire to return to <HI>England,</HI> were ordered on board the <HI>Dutch East-In∣dia</HI> Fleet; And the next Day the whole Fleet, consisting of about twelve Sail, weigh'd anchor and left <HI>Batavia.</HI> On the 8th we arrived at <HI>Bantam;</HI> where we wooded, water'd, and refresh'd our selves; and took in store of Provisions, as Beeves, Hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for our supply during our Pas∣sage to the Cape. This is also a <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory; and the chief Trading is for Pepper. On the 11th we weigh'd from <HI>Bantam.</HI> The Westerly Monsoon was set in pretty hard against us; But however, having a strong Current setting to the Wind-ward, we made shift to turn against the Monsoon: Yet it commonly blowing very hard at Night, whilst we were in the Streights of <HI>Sunda,</HI> we used to run in un∣der the <HI>Java</HI> shore, and there anchor till the next Morning. All through these Streights the Coast is good and bold; and though there be many Sholes, yet the Soundings are good even in the most dan∣gerous place, which is between <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Batavia:</HI> But no Man will venture to
<PB N="288" REF="336"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> sail by Night, although it sholeth gradually near any Bank, and the Anchor-ground is very good, that Ships can stop when they please if they are plying to Windward.</P>
<P>On the 13th we came up with a small high Island, called <HI>Princes Island.</HI> It lies at the West-end of this Streight of <HI>Sunda;</HI> And from hence we took our departure for the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI> We had no∣thing material happen'd to us, in this our Passage: And we arrived at the Cape on the 3d of <HI>February</HI> 1705/6; having been just two Months in our passage: And here we found four Ships belonging to our <HI>East-India</HI> Company.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> is the Southermost part of <HI>Africa,</HI> situated four Degrees and a half within the Southern Temperate Zone. Near it, is the Table Bay; a ve∣ry healthy place, and producing all Ne∣cessaries for the Life of Man. The <HI>Dutch</HI> are Masters of this place, and have here a Fort of about fifty Guns, which they were now about moting round. Half a mile to the Westward of the said Fort, they have belonging to them a pretty Town, con∣sisting of about a hundred and fifty <HI>Dutch</HI> Houses, and a small Church, situated un∣der a very high Mountain, called the <HI>Ta∣ble-Land.</HI> The Town and Fort are under a Governour and a Fiscal, (who, as I have said before, is in the nature of a Judge.)</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="337"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> The Natives of this Place, are a tawny swarthy sort of People, who call them∣selves <HI>Hodmandods;</HI> and are certainly the next to Beasts, of any People on the face of the Earth. Both Men and Women are of a middle Stature, with small Noses, little Mouths and Eyes, and an oval Face. They have a woolly Head of Hair, like the <HI>Guinea</HI> or <HI>Angola-Negroes.</HI> Both Men and Women cover themselves with only two raw Sheeps Hides, just as they come from the Sheeps Back. In the Day they wear them like a Mantle, over their Shoul∣ders; and in the Night when they sleep, one of them serves to lie under them in∣stead of a Bed, the other to cover them. And thus like Beasts they lie, Men, Wo∣men, and Children, the whole Family to∣gether. They smear or grease themselves very much; which makes them stink a∣bominably; And the thicker they are with Grease, the more they are admired by one another. The Women to distinguish themselves from the Men, wear dried Thongs of the Sheeps Skins, rouled round their Legs from the Ankle to the Knee; which makes their Legs seem as big as Posts; and they look'd like a Rowl of Tobacco. They also wear a long Cap (made of the same) which goes up tape∣ring like a Piramid. But their clothing is the same as the Mens, <HI>viz.</HI> two raw Sheeps
<PB N="290" REF="338"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> Skins. They are a very shameless igno∣rant People, and as far as I could perceive, without any Laws or Government of their own; only each Family is subject to the eldest of their Family. Both Men and Women are great Lovers of Tobacco; and for two or three ounces of it, a Man will not stick to prostitute his Wife to any <HI>European</HI> whatsoever. The Men are not at all jealous, and care not how many <HI>Europeans</HI> lye with their Wives; yet they will beat their Wives severely, if they know them to lye with any of their own Nation besides themselves. They are a People that will eat any soul or nasty thing. For if the <HI>Dutch</HI> kill a Beeve or a Sheep, they will beg the Guts, out of which they squeeze the Dung; and with∣out washing or any cleaning at all, cut them into small peices, and lay them upon the fire; and assoon as they are hot through, take them off and eat them.</P>
<P>Their Children, when they are young, are something inclining to be White; and were it not for their nasty way of greazing them, they would make likely Men and Women: For they are most of them very well featured. The <HI>Dutch</HI> did formerly what they could, to bring them to the knowledge of the true God, and to leave their nasty way of living:
<PB N="291" REF="339"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> but never could prevail with them; they still desiring rather to live like Beasts; Worship they seem to have none; ex∣cept at the full Moons; and then they Dance and Sing all or most of the Night; and the brighter the Moon is, the more is their Mirth; For then they think the Moon, which seems to be their God, is well-pleased with them: But if the Moon chance to be obscured with Clouds, then they seem much dejected, and fancy their God is angry with them.</P>
<P>I was told a story by the Person with whom I lodged here, that some years since, the <HI>Dutch</HI> sent two of these <HI>Hod∣mandod</HI> Men to <HI>Holland;</HI> where they were very well cloathed, had a good maintenance allowed them, and for the space of four years were sent up and down to see the several parts of <HI>Hol∣land</HI> and other Countries adjacent: The <HI>Dutch</HI> thinking this would be a means of bringing them to a more civilized way of living. But it proved ineffe∣ctual: For the two <HI>Hodmandods</HI> at their return, as soon as they got ashore, tore off all their Cloaths, and returned to their old beastly way of living.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="340"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> These people have low Matt Houses, in form of a Bee-hive; The Door not above three foot high; and the highest part of the House about six foot high: In the middle of which, in cold weather, they make a Fire; and the whole Family, Men, Women and Children, and their Dogs, all lie round it; where they sleep as sound, as other people do in their Beds of Down. Yet these people are as healthy, and as free from Pains and Aches, as any on the whole Continent of <HI>Africa.</HI> Their Houshold-goods are seldom any thing more than two earthen Pots; one broken, the other whole; The broken Pot serves them instead of a Frying-pan, and the o∣ther to boil their Victuals in.</P>
<P>They are no way ingenious, neither do they follow any Trades. The most of their delight is in looking after Flocks of Sheep; and in this the <HI>Dutch</HI> often em∣ploy them. If one of them does half an hours work for a <HI>Dutchman</HI> or any <HI>Euro∣pean,</HI> he will demand a Doublekey; which is a piece of Money that goes for Two-pence; And if there be occasion to work him from morning till night, he will demand no more.</P>
<P>The Land hereabouts is very mountain∣ous, and the Mountains are most of them very barren, producing only a few small shrubby Bushes. And within the Coun∣try
<PB N="293" REF="341"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> are abundance of Lions, Tygers, wild Elephants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These wild Beasts the <HI>Dutch</HI> kill after this manner: They make a pret∣ty large Circle, upon the edge of which they fix five, six, seven, or eight Posts, about eighteen or twenty foot from each other: Upon each of these Posts is a Mus∣ket made fast, the Muzles of which are all placed so as to point to the Center of the Circle: The Muskets are well loaded; and from the Trigger of each Musket is a small Line, reaching to the Center of the said Circle, and there fastned to a piece of raw Flesh; which when a wild Beast seizes upon, most or all of the Muskets go off, and seldom fail to kill him. Any one that kills a Lion, is paid by the Publick fifty-two Guilders, which amounts to four Pound six Shillings and eight Pence; And for killing a Tyger he has a Reward of twenty-four Guilders or forty Shillings. There was a <HI>Scotchman</HI> whilst we were here, who killed four Lions, three Ty∣gers, and three wild Elephants; for which he had his Reward, according to the aforesaid Proportion.</P>
<P>This place produces several sorts of Fruits, both common and not common to us in <HI>Europe;</HI> as Pomgranates, Water-me∣lons, Chesnuts, with some few Plantains and Bonanoes, and store of very good Grapes, of which the <HI>Dutch</HI> make a very
<PB N="294" REF="342"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> pretty and pleasant Wine in great quanti∣ties, which by Retale is commonly sold at eight Pence a Quart. It also produces abundance of Garden-Fruit, which is ve∣ry refreshing to those that arrive here sick of the Scurvy.</P>
<P>Of Beasts here are great store; <HI>to wit,</HI> Lions, Tygers, Elephants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which all run wild up and down the Country; but near the Towns they are seldom seen: Here are also abundance of Sheep, ve∣ry large, and I think as good Meat as ever I eat.</P>
<P>Of Fowls here are also several sorts; But the most noted, as I think, is the Ostridge; which is a very large Fowl. The Bird it self is little valuable, but for its Feathers, which are sent as Rarities to seve∣ral parts of the World. Their Eggs are very good Meat, as I have experienc'd many times. That these Birds do feed upon Iron, Stones, or any thing that chances to be near them, is fabulous; but, like a great ma∣ny other Fowls, they peck up small Stones, which only serve to digest their proper Food. They are of several colours, as black, white, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Sea Inhabitants, the most noted is the Seal, or, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> call it, the <HI>Sea-Hound.</HI> They are the same as those be∣fore spoken of at the Island <HI>Juan Fernan∣does,</HI> only the Furr of these is not so fine.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="343"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> In this Harbour, on the South side, are two great high noted Mountains; the one called the Table-Land, which is pretty plain and even at the top; and the other called the Sugar-loaf, from its shape. At the top of this Sugar-loaf the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a small House, and four Guns mounted: Here they always keep a Look-out, and at the approach of any Ship or Ships, hoist a Flag, and fire as many Guns as they see Ships, to give notice to those at the Town.</P>
<P>During our stay here, there arrived some more <HI>East-India</HI> homeward bound Ships, both <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English;</HI> also here we met with some of our Men that had left us in the Gulf of <HI>Nicoya,</HI> and went away with our Chief-mate. They gave us an account, that in a Week after they left us, they went into the Port of <HI>Ria Leon</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> where they took two <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships at Anchor; one of which, being very old and worm∣eaten, they immediately sunk. Which being done, they sent two of their Pri∣soners ashore with a Letter to the Gover∣nour, in which they demanded 10000 Dollars for the ransome of the other Prize. The Governour sent them word, that the Owners of the said Ship were poor, and that the Town was also poor, so that they could not give so much;
<PB N="296" REF="344"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> but if 4000 Dollars would satisfie them, he would send them aboard the next day, upon our Mens word, that upon the receipt of the Money they would de∣liver up the said Prize. They answered, that they wanted Provisions and Water; and therefore whatever was found in the said Prize either Eatable or Drinkable, should not be comprehended in the Bar∣gain. To this the Governour readily agreed, and sent the Money. And assoon as the Provisions could be got out of her, she was according to agreement delivered up. From thence our Men went to the Gulf of <HI>Salinas,</HI> and haul'd their Vessel ashore, and clean'd and refitted her. And from thence, with all the haste they could, they proceeded on their Voyage for <HI>India;</HI> and in fifty four Days reached the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, having kept all the way in the Latitude of 18 d. North. Amongst the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands a Canoa came off to them with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Priest in her: Him they detained and sent the Canoa ashore for some fresh Provisions, as a ransom for the said Priest; which accordingly was sent to them, and they released the priest. From thence they went to the Island <HI>Pulo Condore;</HI> but sinding the <HI>English</HI> all cut off, they went for <HI>Mocoa</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> where after they had given an account from whence they came,
<PB N="297" REF="345"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="year"/> they every one dispersed, some for <HI>Goa</HI> to serve the <HI>Portugueze,</HI> some to <HI>Benjar</HI> to the <HI>English,</HI> and others to serve the <HI>Mogull.</HI></P>
<P>On the 24th of <HI>March,</HI> we having re∣fitted our Ships, and refreshed our Men, and taken in store of fresh Provisions; and there being a fresh Gale of Wind at S. E; we all weigh'd from the Cape, and went out between <HI>Penguin</HI> Island and the Main Land; having the Main on the Star-board-side, and the Island <HI>Penguin</HI> on the Lar-board. This is a pretty low sandy I∣sland. In the middle of which, upon the highest part of it, they have a few Guns mounted, and near them a Flag-staff, on which at the approach of any Ship they hoist a Flag, and fire a Gun, to give no∣tice to the Town. This Island takes its name from a vast number of Birds, called <HI>Penguins,</HI> which commonly resort near it. These Birds are about the bigness of a Wild Duck: They do not fly, but flutter, having no Wings, but only stumps like young Ducks; and these stumps are in∣stead of Fins to them when they are in the Water. They have a sharp Bill, but Feet like a Duck; and their Flesh is but mean Victuals.</P>
<P>We were now twenty-four Sail of us, <HI>viz.</HI> nine <HI>English</HI> and fifteen <HI>Dutch;</HI> and the Gale continuing, soon carried us into
<PB N="298" REF="346"/>
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"/> the true Trade. We met with nothing material till the 10th of <HI>April;</HI> <MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"/> when two of the <HI>English</HI> Ships sailing very heavy, fell a stern, and lost our Compa∣ny. They put into St. <HI>Hellena;</HI> and, as we hear since, were taken out of the Road by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>On the 11th we had twenty five Hogs killed, for the Ships Company; and the Commodore ordered a Hog to a Mess, that is, to every seven Men, to dispose of as we pleased, besides our daily Al∣lowance; so that we had more Victuals than we could tell what to do with.</P>
<P>On the 15th, a Man being barbarously murthered on Board the <HI>Dutch</HI> Vice-Ad∣miral, the Murtherer was brought on Board our Ship and tryed for his Life, and the same day condemned to dye. He owned he did the Murther, and de∣sired the favour of the Court that he might chuse his Death; which was gran∣ted; and he chose to be Shot, which the next day was accordingly done; all the Fleet lying by till his Death, and then we all made sail again.</P>
<P>On the 17th we saw the Island of <HI>Ascension;</HI> but did not touch here for Turtle, although it was their laying time; the reason was, because we were so well provided with Provisions at the Cape, that we had no occasion for more; and
<PB N="299" REF="347"/>
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"/> the <HI>English</HI> Ships being willing to keep us Company, they also did not touch here.</P>
<P>On the 19th we had fine fair Weather, with a fresh Gale at South East. About eleven this morning happened a great Earth-quake. At first it seemed as if the Ship run along upon the Ground: So we heaved out a Lead on each side with two hundred fathom of Line, but found no ground. The whole Fleet felt the Shock at the same time; so that for half a quarter of an hour there was nothing but making of Signals and firing of Guns. We then reckoned the Island of <HI>Ascen∣sion</HI> to bear South East, distant about forty Leagues.</P>
<P>Hence we steered away to the North Westward, and on the 14th of <HI>June</HI> saw four Sail of <HI>French</HI> Privateers. They lay a while and viewed us, but did not think fit to come amongst us.</P>
<P>On the 30th we found our selves in the Latitude of 62 d. 40 m. North, which was the furthest to the Northward that I ever was. And here I could not but take notice of the difference of cold in this place and in 60 d. of Southern Lati∣tude. For there we had continual Show∣ers of Snow or Hail, and the weather very cold; whereas here on the contrary we found the Weather very fair and mo∣derate.
<PB N="300" REF="348"/>
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"/> The reason of which, I suppose, was this. When we were to the South∣ward, we were always pretty near to the Main of <HI>America,</HI> having it to the West of us. Likewise when we were to the Northward, we were always pretty near the main Land of <HI>Europe,</HI> having it to the East of us. Now being near the Land, we always account the Land-winds to be the coldest, and the Sea-winds the warmest. Thus the North Easterly Wind is accounted the coldest Wind we have in <HI>England, Holland,</HI> &amp;c. But in the same Latitude North, near the Coast of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> the North West Wind is commonly accounted the coldest. And in the same height of South Latitude on the Coast of <HI>America,</HI> the South West Wind is the coldest: As near the Cape of good Hopo the South East Wind is the coldest. Now the Westerly Winds at such a height both in North and South Latitude, having ge∣nerally the Predominancy over the Ea∣sterly, very much alter the degrees of the heat or cold of the Weather. For which reason, in the South part of <HI>America</HI> the Westerly Wind caused cold Weather; but to the Northward the Westerly wind caused warm Weather. And as the East∣erly-wind, being near the <HI>European</HI> shore, is the coldest; so, being near the <HI>Ameri∣can</HI> shore in the same height of Southern
<PB N="301" REF="349"/>
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"/> Latitude, the Westerly-wind is the cold∣est.</P>
<P>On the 3d of <HI>July,</HI> in the Evening, we saw the Islands of <HI>Faro,</HI> bearing East by North, distant about eleven or twelve Leagues. We also sounded, but had no ground at two hundred and ten fathom. At twelve at Night we had ground at eighty-five fathom; and at three the next morning, at seventy fathom. On the 4th of <HI>July</HI> at noon the opening of the two Islands of <HI>Faro</HI> bore South East, distant about eight Leagues. We then steering North East and ground at eighty fathom, small pieces of broken Shells. All last Night we kept firing a Gun once every half hour, to give notice to the Cruizers, whom we expected to meet here.</P>
<P>On the 5th, according to our Expecta∣tions, we met with our Convoy, which had been cruizing for us. They consisted of eight <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, four Victual∣ers, and three of the Companies Privateers. After Mutual Salutations we proceeded to the South Eastward, being all bound for <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> And on the 15th of <HI>July,</HI> we all arrived safely in the <HI>Texel;</HI> and on the 17th got to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where we continued a while. After which, my self and the rest of our Company went to see the several parts of <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> as <HI>Delf, Rotterdam,</HI> the <HI>Hague,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="300" REF="350"/>
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="year"/> And on the 26th of <HI>August,</HI> 1706. af∣ter many Dangers both by Sea and Land, we happily arrived in <HI>England;</HI> being but eighteen out of one hundred and eighty-three which went out with us.</P>
