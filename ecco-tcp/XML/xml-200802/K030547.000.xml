<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by MR. HENDERSON.</STAGE>
<L>TO holy land in superstition's day,</L>
<L>When bare foot pilgrims trode their weary way,</L>
<L>By mother church's unremitting law</L>
<L>Scourg'd into grace, with shoulders red and raw;</L>
<L>Kneeling demure before the sacred shrine,</L>
<L>On the hard flint th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y begg'd the boon divine;</L>
<L>Pardon for what offending flesh had done,</L>
<L>And pity for the long long course they'd run,</L>
<L>Fines, pains and penalties, securely past,</L>
<L>Slow pac'd forgiveness met their prayer at last,</L>
<L>Full absolution from conceeding Rome,</L>
<L>Cancell'd all sin, past, present and to come.</L>
<L>Your Poet thus prophanely led aside</L>
<L>To range o'er Tragic land without a guide,</L>
<L>To pick perhaps, with no invidious aim,</L>
<L>A few cast fallings from the tree of fame.</L>
<L>Damn'd, tho' untried, by the despotic rule</L>
<L>Of the stern Doctors in detraction's school;</L>
<L>Lash'd down each column of a public page,</L>
<L>And driv'n o'er burning ploughshares to the stage,</L>
<L>Be rhim'd, be ridicul'd with doggrel wit,</L>
<L>Sues out a pardon from his Pope—<HI>the Pit.</HI></L>
<L>Pensive he stands in penitential weeds,</L>
<L>With a huge rosary of untold beads;</L>
<L>Sentenc'd for past offences to rehearse,</L>
<L><HI>Ave Apollo's</HI> to the God of verse;</L>
<L>And sure there's no one but an Author knows</L>
<L>The Penance, which an Author undergoes.</L>
<L>If then your worships a few stripes award</L>
<L>Let not your beadles lay them on too hard;</L>
<L>For in the world there's not a thing so thin,</L>
<L>So full of feeling, as your Poet's skin:</L>
<L>What if, perchance, he snatch'd a playful kiss</L>
<L>From that free hearted romp the Comic Miss;</L>
<L>That frolick's past, he's turn'd to years of grace,</L>
<L>And a young sinner now supplies his place.</L>
<L>Sure you'll not grudge a little sober chat</L>
<L>With this demure old tabby Tragic cat;</L>
<L>No charge lies here of conversation crim</L>
<L>He hopes you'll think her fame, no worse for him.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by MISS YOUNGE.</STAGE>
<L>FROM ancient Thespis to the present age</L>
<L>The world hath oft been term'd a public stage,</L>
<L>A thread-bare metaphor, which in its time</L>
<L>Hath patch'd much prose and heel-piec'd many a rhime;</L>
<L>Ev'n the grave pulpit sometimes <HI>deigns</HI> to use</L>
<L>The emphatic terms of the proscribed Muse,</L>
<L>Calls birth our entry, death our exit calls,</L>
<L>And at life's close exclaims—the curtain falls;</L>
<L>And so concludes upon the drama's plan</L>
<L>That fretting, strutting, short-hour actor, man.</L>
<L><HI>Are we all actors then?</HI>—yes, all from Adam,</L>
<L><HI>And actresses?</HI>—I apprehend so Madam.</L>
<L>Some fill their cast with grace, others with none,</L>
<L>Some are shov'd off the stage, and some shov'd on;</L>
<L>Some good, some bad, still we all act a part,</L>
<L>Whilst we disguise the language of the heart;</L>
<L>Nature's plain taste provides a simple treat,</L>
<L>But art, the <HI>Cook,</HI> steps in and mars the meat;</L>
<L>The comic blade makes ridicule his test,</L>
<L>And on his tomb proclaims that life's a jest,</L>
<L>The swaggering braggart, in true tragic cast,</L>
<L>Bellows blank verse and daggers to the last;</L>
<L>Whilst clubs of neutral petit-maitres boast</L>
<L>A kind of opera company at most,</L>
<L>Whose dress, air, action, all is imitation,</L>
<L>A poor, insipid, servile, French translation;</L>
<L>Whose tame dull scene glides uniform along,</L>
<L>In comi—farei—pastoral—sing—song—</L>
<L>'Till all awaken'd by the rattling die</L>
<L>Club wits, and make—a modern tragedy;</L>
<L>A tragedy alas! good friends, look round,</L>
<L>What have we left to tread but tragic ground?</L>
<L>Four authors leagu'd to shake the human soul,</L>
<L>Unsheath the dagger, and infuse the bowl,</L>
<L>At length descending to the least, and last,</L>
<L>We hope the terror of the time is past,</L>
<L>Full sated now with battle, blood, and murder,</L>
<L>England is conquer'd—fate can reach no further,</L>
<L>Bid then the weeping <HI>Pleiads</HI> dry their eyes,</L>
<L>And turn to happier scenes and brighter skies.</L>
