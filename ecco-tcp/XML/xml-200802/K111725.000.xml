<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Happiness of Mankind depends visibly on their living in Society, and of Course under Subjection to Laws; of which, the shortest and the clearest Proof is this, that Men are alike miserable, under the two extremes of Tyranny and Anarchy; both of which are Privations of Law, and consequently of Government. The Operation of Laws, with respect to the Wel∣fare of Society, depends upon their Execution, and this infers the Ne∣cessity of Magistrates, who, in all Monarchies, derive their Autho∣rity from the supreme Magistrate; whence the King is, with equal Truth and Propriety, said to be the Fountain of Justice as well as of Honour. The Nature of Offices has been always declared to the People by exterior Signs, and hence the Custom of investing Superior, and more especially the Supreme Magistrate, with extra∣ordinary Solemnity, at his Entrance upon Government, which, tho' with very different Forms, has yet, in some Form or other, been practised in every civilized Nation.</P>
<P>There can be no Doubt, that the Ceremony of Anointing was borrowed from the Scriptures; and the <HI>Jews</HI> tell us, that all their Kings were anointed, from <HI>Saul</HI> to <HI>Hircanus.</HI> It passed from the <HI>Jews</HI> to other Nations, and seems to have been practised here soon after the Introduction of Christianity. The Monks indeed, would willingly persuade us, that <HI>Alfred the Great,</HI> was the first anointed King, and that he received his Unction from the Pope at <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
which may be true, in respect to the Unction; but then, as <HI>Alfred</HI> was a Child of five Years old, it is much more likely, that it was the Chrism or Unction used in the Ceremony of Confirmation, than the Regal Unction. It appears from <HI>Gildas,</HI> the most ancient Writer of our own Nation, that is yet extant, that the British Kings were anointed; and this Practice was so constant, that the common Phrase in the old Chronicles, to express the Accession of a Prince to the Government, is this, that at such a Time, he was anointed King. We have therefore used this Ceremony as early, if not ear∣lier, than any other Nation in Europe, as, if it was necessary, might be very easily shewn.</P>
<P>The Use of Crowns also is very ancient; and, in Process of Time, grew to be of very different Forms. The Diadem was ori∣ginally of Cloth, and bound about the Head like a Fillet. After∣wards a Circle of Gold was in Use, some times plain, as was the ancient Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> sometimes adorned with Spires or Rays. The <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings used both. The former being called King's-Band, and the latter King's-Helm, as being worn upon a Helmet. In latter Times, it was also worn without the Helm, as well as with it, as appears in the Coins of our <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings. Other Ornaments were gradually added, such as the Flower-de-Lis. At length the Emperor wore a Crown with Bars, rising from the Sides, and join∣ing at the Top, thence stiled a Crown Imperial. Authors are not agreed, when this was first introduced into <HI>England,</HI> some say by <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> III. on his being made Vicar General of the Empire, by <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> others by <HI>Henry</HI> V. Be that as it will, if an Imperial Crown is the Mark of Independent Sovereignty, then, no Doubt, our Kings have a Right to wear it, as well as those of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and so they have long worn it.</P>
<P>There was not any thing, in which our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ancestors were more curious and exact, than in their Religious Ceremonies; and therefore we may reasonably suppose, they were particularly so in the Inauguration; or, as their own emphatic Term was, in the hallow∣ing their Kings. This we find frequently mentioned, in that au∣thentic History, stiled the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle. This Solemnity, how∣ever, was not confined anciently to any particular Place; for, amongst
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
other Princes, <HI>Alfred,</HI> justly surnamed <HI>the Great,</HI> was crowned at <HI>Winchester, Ethelstan,</HI> at <HI>Bath,</HI> where, as that History tells us, there were mighty Rejoicings, and a great Resort of the Clergy and Nobili∣ty upon the Occasion. But both in earlier and later Times than these, several of our Kings were crowned at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> which from thence received its Name, and is therefore stiled in <HI>Latin, Re∣giodunum</HI> by <HI>Leland,</HI> who thinks that at such Times a Theatre was erected, that the whole Ceremony might be more conspicuous to the People. But <HI>Edward the Confessor</HI> was crowned at <HI>Winchester;</HI> and it is particularly mentioned in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle, that he re∣ceived many grave Exhortations from the Archbishop, in relation to the Duties of his high Office. <HI>Harold</HI> was crowned at <HI>Westminster,</HI> founded and scarce finished by King <HI>Edward,</HI> and as that Chronicle says, by the Appointment of his Predecessor, and by the Election of the People. In Respect to the Confessor's Memory, the Abbey of <HI>Westminster</HI> became in succeeding Times, the usual Place of our Monarch's Coronation, more especially as the <HI>Regalia</HI> of that King were kept there.</P>
<P>In our old Historians there are no Traces of the Ceremony, which is not to be wondered at, considering the Brevity of those Annals; but in the Leidger books, and other Abbey Records, many Fragments are to be met with, of most of the Ecclesiastical Ceremonies, and amongst others of the Coronations of some of these Kings, from which it plainly appears, that the Forms in use after the Conquest, and even the modern Forms, were borrowed from these; and this very pro∣bably would be still more evident, if we had any <HI>Saxon</HI> Ceremonial compleat. As it is, we see plainly that the different Prayers at the Unction, Crowning, putting the Sword, the Sceptre, and the Ball into the King's Hands, were taken from them; and, if we consider the Reverence ever paid to Antiquity, more especially in Matters of this Kind, it will not certainly appear strange.</P>
<P>After what has been related, it may seem a little surprising that some of our ablest Antiquaries have complained, that they could meet with no settled or authentic Form of the Coronation of our Monarchs. But a little Consideration will shew us, that we may easily account for this, in a manner very consistent with what has been
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
already said. While our Ancestors continued Papists the Ceremo∣nial still remained in <HI>Latin,</HI> tho' it may be not without Additions and Alterations. But after the Reformation farther Changes became necessary, as we find by the very imperfect Accounts yet remaining of the Coronation of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. in which his Oath, and no doubt, some other Parts were in <HI>English,</HI> that they might be under∣stood by the People. In Process of Time, several of the Prayers and Collets grew obsolete and uncouth in their Language, which therefore rendered it requisite to review and retouch them, in order to accommodate the Service to the Language of the Times in which it was performed. When therefore Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> was accused of altering the Coronation Service, at the Inauguration of <HI>Charles</HI> I. he pleaded the absolute Necessity of this; he said, that the Muta∣tions and Emendations, which were made in some Parts of the Ser∣vice, were partly to render the Sense clear, and partly to make it proper in grammatical <HI>English,</HI> which, he said, was done by Royal Authority, in a Committee for that Purpose; but that no material or essential Alterations were made, and that the King's Coronation Oath particularly remained untouched, and was the same with his Father's, which was settled by that pious and worthy Prelate, Arch∣bishop <HI>Whitgift.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, it may be truly affirmed, that the Bulk and Substance of the Coronation Ceremony is the very same at this day, as it was above a thousand Years ago; and if any thing has been retrenched, it has been owing to superstitious Circumstances, super∣induced on the ancient and venerable Form, which the <HI>Saxons</HI> had in use, and to which, even after the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest, the Nation in general were so much attached, that it was thought expedient to preserve it; though afterwards, when the Knowledge of this Form came to be lost with the People, the Clergy might possibly intro∣duce Expressions more favourable to their own Power, and more suitable to those Notions they were desirous should prevail. But these again, as we have before observed, were at the Reformation curtailed or taken away.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
As to the Pieces that are here presented to our Readers View, they are such as may contribute to give them a tolerable Idea of the Co∣ronation of a King and Queen. It was in this View, that the Or∣der for the Coronation of <HI>Charles</HI> II. was selected, as being in most Respects preferable to that of his Brother, which has been so pomp∣ously displayed by Mr. <HI>Sandford,</HI> whose Knowledge and Diligence we by no means would depreciate; and the Assistance that he re∣ceived hath enabled him to render it a truly valuable Work, so that it has been, and will be justly regarded as the fittest Model for fu∣ture Ceremonies of that Kind. King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was not married at the Time of his Coronation, and therefore we have annexed the Ceremony of the Coronation of King <HI>James</HI>'s Queen, <HI>Mary,</HI> which will be found exactly agreeable to that of <HI>Sandford,</HI> with the Addi∣tion of the Prayers, which, as well known at that Time, are, to shorten his Account, introduced with only a Line or two, and the Remainder dropt by an &amp;c.</P>
<P>As to the Notes, they relate to Persons and Things; with respect to the former, the Reader will find what in the Perusal of such Pieces it is very natural to desire, the Names of those Prelates who assisted at those Ceremonies, which, as needless at that Juncture, were left out when they were originally published. In regard to the latter, they are calculated to explain the several Parts of the <HI>Regalia,</HI> and other Passages that seem to require Elucidation, that the whole might be as plain and perspicuous as possible. There is a Pleasure in reviewing the Pomp of past Triumphs, in recalling to our Re∣membrance those great Personages, who are long ago removed from our View, but whom the Fame of their Actions still renders worthy of our Notice. The whole stands now in such a Point of Light, as that the Ceremonies of these Coronations may be as clearly and as fully conceived, as if we had been present at them; and as far as could be judged, Care has been taken to answer every Ques∣tion, that a judicious and inquisitive Peruser would naturally ask in go∣ing through them, the Omission of which so frequently and so greatly perplexes Relations of this Kind, and renders them more apt to raise than to satisfy our Curiosity.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
As to the Appendix, it is composed of Pieces not commonly known, or easy to be found, as being either involved in large Works, where few would take the Pains to seek them, or hid in the Closets of Antiquaries, where it would have been no easy Matter to find them. The Account particularly of the Manner in which our an∣cient <HI>Regalia</HI> was lost, and in what it consisted, has so near a Rela∣tion to the Subject, and contributes so much to set it in a clearer Light, that it must be allowed to deserve a Place in such a Col∣lection; as does also the Order of the solemn Cavalcade from the <HI>Tower</HI> to <HI>Westminster,</HI> which our Ancestors esteemed no inconsiderable Part of the Ceremony. These are likewise illustrated with such Notes as appeared necessary to explain them, and it is hoped, that the whole taken together will be found no unpleasing, unentertain∣ing, or uninstructive Miscellany on the Subject of Coronations, which being the general Topic of Conversation at present occasioned their Publication, and as this has been attended with no small Degree of Haste, they are submitted to the Candour of the Public.</P>

<HEAD>THE CEREMONY OF THE CORONATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The PROCEEDINGS on the Day of his MAJESTY'S Coronation were as follows:</HEAD>
<P>UPON <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 23d of <HI>April,</HI> being <HI>St. George's</HI> Day, about half an hour after seven in the Morning, the KING entered in∣to his Rich <HI>Barge,</HI> took Water from the Privy Stairs at <HI>White∣hall,</HI> and landed at the Parliament Stairs, from whence he proceeded up to the Room behind the <HI>Lord's House</HI> called the <HI>Princes Lodgings;</HI> where, after he had reposed himself for a while, he was arrayed in his <HI>Royal Robes</HI> of <HI>Crimson Velvet,</HI> furred with <HI>Ermine,</HI> by which time the Nobility being assembled, robed themselves in the <HI>Lord's House</HI> and <HI>Painted Chamber.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Judges</HI> also, with those of the <HI>Long Robe,</HI> the <HI>Knights</HI> of the <HI>Bath</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">These were anciently made, only on three Occasions. The Coronation of a King or Queen, the Creation of a Prince of Wales, or of a Duke of York. The Order was styled of the Holy Trinity, tho' from the Ceremony of Bathing before they received the Honour of Knighthood, they were commonly styled Knights of the Bath. The Motto of the Order was anciently, <HI>Tria Numina juncta in uno,</HI> alluding to the Mystery of the Holy Trinity. But at the Coronation of King James the First, the Word <HI>Numina</HI> was omitted, and the Motto has ever since been <HI>Tria juncta in uno,</HI> alluding to the Union of the three Crowns. On this Occasion, Sixty-eight Gen∣tlemen of the first Families in the Kingdom, were created Knights of the Bath.</NOTE>, and <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the <HI>Privy Chamber,</HI> met in the Court of <HI>Requests.</HI></P>
<P>After some Space, the King's <HI>Heralds</HI> and <HI>Pursuivants</HI> began to set the Proceeding in Order, each of them taking his Share, assigned in <HI>Chapter,</HI> held at the <HI>Heralds Office,</HI> the Evening before, and thence directed all the beforementioned Degrees, except the Nobility, down into <HI>Westminster Hall,</HI> where the rest of the Proceeding attended, and from whence the March began.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
About half an hour after Nine, the Nobility having been first called over in the Painted Chamber, proceeded each according to his Rank and Dignity, in their Robes and Coronets before the KING, through the Court of Requests, into Westminster Hall, ascended up to the <HI>State,</HI> which was raised at the <HI>West End,</HI> and placed themselves upon each Side thereof.</P>
<P>HIS MAJESTY being set in his <HI>Chair</HI> under a <HI>rich Cloth</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> First Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> the <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>Jewel House,</HI> presented the <HI>Sword</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> as also the <HI>Sword</HI> called <HI>Curtana</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Curtana is a Sword without a Point, and is stiled the Sword of Mercy, or St. Edward the Confessor's Sword; the first in Point of Honour of all that are born before the King: The Length of the Blade is thirty-two Inches; its Breadth near two Inches: The Handle is about four Inches in Length, covered with Gold Wire; the Pomel an Inch and three Quarters, which, with the Cross, is Steel, gilt; the Cross is in Length near eight Inches.

The other is sharp pointed, its Blade forty Inches long, and an Inch and three Quarters in Breadth; its Handle, Pomel, Cross, and Scabbard differing little, if any thing, from the former.</NOTE>, who took and delivered them to the Lord High Chamberlain<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Montague Bertie, Earl of Lindsey, eldest Son of Robert, Earl of Lindsey, General of the Forces of Charles the First, at the Battle of Edge Hill.

<P>Then the said <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>Jewel House,</HI> delivered likewise the <HI>Spurs,</HI> to the Lord High Constable, and he again the same, to the Lord High Chamberlain, who also placed them upon the Table.</P>
<P>Immediately after, the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Prebends</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> by whom the <HI>Ragalia</HI> had been brought in Procession, from the <HI>Abby Church</HI> in∣to <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall, being vested in rich Copes, proceeded from the lower End thereof in manner following:

<P>All standing towards the lower End of the <HI>Hall,</HI> ready to proceed; they made their first Reverence together, then coming to the middle of the said Hall, they there made a second, and thence going a little further, both the <HI>Choirs</HI> fell off and stood on either Side, through which Lane, the <HI>Pursuivants, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Kings</HI> passing, fell like∣wise off on every side, the Seniors still placing themselves uppermost, towards the <HI>Throne,</HI> after whom, the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Prebends</HI> proceeded, and arrived at the <HI>Foot</HI> of the Stone Steps, ascending to the Throne, where they made another Reverence.</P>
<P>This being done, the Dean and Prebends, with <HI>Garter</HI> principal <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Arms</HI> before them, (he waited their coming) together ascend∣ed

<P>When the <HI>Proceeding</HI> had entered the <HI>Abby Church,</HI> all passed through the <HI>Choir,</HI> and thence went up the <HI>Stairs</HI> towards the great <HI>Stage,</HI> and as they arrived at the top thereof, were disposed by the <HI>He∣ralds</HI> into two <HI>Galleries,</HI> built on either Side, the upper End of the <HI>Choir.</HI></P>
<P>That on the <HI>North</HI> Side, received the Aldermen of London, the Judges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gentlemen of the Long Robe, the Choir of Westminster, the Gentlemen and Children of the King's Chapel; (excepting twelve Gentlemen, four Children, and one Organist, who went into a Gal∣lery, raised on the <HI>South</HI> Side of the <HI>upper Choir,</HI> peculiarly appointed for them) And in the Gallery on the <HI>South</HI> Side were seated, the Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> and Gentlemen of the <HI>Privy Chamber.</HI> The KING being entered the <HI>West Door</HI> of the <HI>Abby Church,</HI> was received with an <HI>Anthem,</HI> begun by the <HI>Choir</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> who with the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Prebends,</HI> had before fallen off from the <HI>Proceeding,</HI> a little on the left Hand of the Middle Isle, and stayed there, to attend his coming, where also a <HI>Faldstool</HI> and <HI>Cushions</HI> were laid ready for his MAJESTY to kneel at.</P>
<P>The <HI>Anthem</HI> sung was the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 6th Verses of Psalm cxxii. I was glad <HI>when they said</HI> unto me, <Q><HI>We will go into the</HI> HOUSE <HI>of the</HI> LORD.</Q><Q><PB N="8" REF="16"/>
<HI>Whither the</HI> Tribes go up, <HI>the</HI> Tribes of the LORD, <HI>unto the</HI> Testi∣mony <HI>of</HI> ISRAEL, <HI>to give</HI> Thanks <HI>unto the</HI> Name <HI>of the</HI> LORD.</Q>
<Q>For <HI>there are set</HI> Thrones <HI>of</HI> Judgment, <HI>the</HI> Throne <HI>of the</HI> HOUSE <HI>of</HI> DAVID.</Q>
<Q>Pray <HI>for the</HI> Peace <HI>of</HI> JERUSALEM, <HI>they shall</HI> prosper <HI>that</HI> love THEE.</Q></P>
<P>The KING being arrived at the <HI>Faldstool,</HI> kneeled down, and used some <HI>private Ejaculations,</HI> which being finished, he thence proceeded into, and through, the <HI>Choir,</HI> up to the great <HI>Theatre,</HI> (erected close to the four high Pillars standing between the <HI>Choir</HI> and the <HI>Altar</HI>) upon which the <HI>Throne</HI> of <HI>State</HI> was placed, being a Square raised on five Degrees, at the Entrance whereof, were set a <HI>Chair, Footstool,</HI> and <HI>Cushion,</HI> covered with Cloth of <HI>Gold,</HI> whereon he reposed himself.</P>
<P>Immediately after the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who was appointed to offi∣ciate in Part that Day, for the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> whose Age and Weakness rendered him incapable of performing his whole Duty at the <HI>Coronation,</HI> having the Lord High Constable, the Earl Marshal, the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Lord High Chancellor, and the Lord Chamberlain of the Household before him, went first to the <HI>South,</HI> next to the <HI>West,</HI> and lastly to the <HI>North</HI> Side of the <HI>Theatre,</HI> and at every of the said <HI>Sides,</HI> acquainted the <HI>People,</HI> that he presented to Them, KING CHARLES, the rightful <HI>Inheritor</HI> of the <HI>Crown</HI> of this <HI>Realm,</HI> and asked them if they were willing to do their <HI>Homage, Service,</HI> and bounden <HI>Duty</HI> to <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>As this was doing the KING rose up, and stood by the aforesaid <HI>Chair,</HI> turning his <HI>Face</HI> still to that <HI>Side</HI> of the <HI>Stage,</HI> where the said Bishop stood, when he spake to the <HI>People,</HI> who signified their <HI>Wil∣lingness,</HI> by loud <HI>Shouts</HI> and <HI>Acclamations.</HI></P>
<P>The same <HI>Question</HI> was likewise put by the said Bishop, to all the <HI>Nobility</HI> present.</P>
<P>Immediately after this, the following <HI>Anthem</HI> was sung, by the Gentlemen of the King's Chapel. <Q>Let thy <HI>Hand</HI> be <HI>strengthened</HI> and thy <HI>Right Hand</HI> be <HI>exalted.</HI> Let <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> be the <HI>Preparation</HI> of thy <HI>Seat</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> go before thy <HI>Face.</HI></Q></P>

Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> went down from the <HI>Stage</HI> towards the <HI>Altar,</HI> and having made his Reverence placed himself at the <HI>North</HI> Side thereof.</P>
<P>Then the KING descended from his <HI>Throne,</HI> and proceeded towards the <HI>Altar,</HI> being supported by the Bishops of <HI>Durham,</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> with the four <HI>Swords,</HI> the Grand Officers, the Noblemen and Bishops, that carried the <HI>Regalia</HI> before him, the Dean of <HI>Westmin∣ster</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Dr. John Warner</NOTE> also attending. Being arrived at the Steps of the <HI>Altar,</HI> he kneeled down upon the <HI>Cushion</HI> there laid ready for him, having first offered the <HI>Pall,</HI> which was of Cloth of <HI>Gold,</HI> and born by the Earl of <HI>Sandwich;</HI> as also a <HI>Wedge</HI> of <HI>Gold</HI> of a Pound weight, presented unto his <HI>Hands,</HI> by the Lord <HI>Cornwallis</HI> Treasurer of his Houshold; both which were received from the KING, by the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who laid them reverently upon the <HI>Altar.</HI> Immediately after, his MAJESTY retired to a <HI>Chair</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> set on the <HI>South</HI> Side of the <HI>Altar,</HI> a little below the Traverse, of Crimson Taffety.</P>
<P>After this the Bishops and Noblemen that carried the <HI>Regalia</HI> drew near to the <HI>Altar,</HI> and presented every particular to the said Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who placed them also upon the <HI>Altar,</HI> and having so done, they retired to their Seats. Whereupon the KING kneeled at a <HI>Fald∣stool,</HI> set on the Right Side of the <HI>Chair</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> whilst the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> said this <HI>Prayer,</HI> <Q>O GOD, which doth visit those that are humble, and dost comfort us by thy Holy SPIRIT, send down thy Grace upon this thy Servant CHARLES, that by him we may feel thy Presence among us, through JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.</Q></P>
<P>This <HI>Prayer</HI> ended, the Bishop of <HI>Worcester</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Dr. George Morley.</NOTE> went up into the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> placed on the <HI>North</HI> Side of the <HI>Altar,</HI> opposite to the KING, and began his <HI>Sermon,</HI> the <HI>Text</HI> being taken out of the 28th Chapter of <HI>Proverbs,</HI> and the second Verse.</P>
<P>From the beginning of the aforesaid Offering, to this Time, the KING was bare; but now he put on his <HI>Cap,</HI> made of <HI>Crimson Velvet</HI> turned up with <HI>Ermine,</HI> with which he sat covered all the Sermon Time.</P>
<P>On the KING'S <HI>right Hand,</HI> stood the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> and be∣yond him, the Noblemen who carried the <HI>Swords,</HI> and held them na∣ked and erect.</P>

<P><HI>St. Edward's</HI> ancient <HI>Chair</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">This ancient Chair is of very solid hard Wood, painted and wrought after a very antique Manner. It is in Height fix Foot seven Inches, in Breadth at the Bottom thirty-eight Inches, in Depth twenty-four Inches. From the Seat to the Bottom is twenty-five Inches, the Breadth of the Seat within the Side twenty-eight Inches, and the Depth eighteen Inches. The bottom Board nine Inches from the Ground is supported at the four Corners by as many Lions, and between the Seat and this bottom Board is inclosed that Stone, which Hector Boethius calls <HI>Fatale Marmor.</HI> The Legend concerning it is this, that it is the very Stone on which the Patriarch Jacob reposed his Head in the Plain of Luz. It is of a bluish Colour, mixed with some Veins of red, of an oblong Form, twenty two Inches long, thirteen broad, and eleven deep. It was brought to Bri∣gantia in the Province of Galicia in Spain, by Gathel King of Scots, who used it as his Throne. Transported from thence into Ireland by Simon Brech the first King of Scotland, who ruled there about Seven Hundred Years before Chrift. Three Hundred and Twenty Years after this, King Fergus removed it into Scotland, where, Anno Domini 859, it was placed in the Abby of Scoon by King Kenneth, who caused it to be inclosed in this Wooden Chair with this Distich:
<Q><L>Ni fallat fatum, (some Copies read vatum) Scoti hunc quocunque locatum</L>
<L>Invenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</L></Q>
<Q><L>If Truth our Sages speak, nor Fables feign;</L>
<L>Where'er this Stone is found; the Scots shall reign.</L></Q>
Edward the First, in the twenty-fourth Year of his Reign Anno Domini 1296, having vanquished John Baliol, brought it from Scotland, placed it in the Abby of Westminster, and dedicated it to St. Edward the Confessor, since which Time our Kings have been always seated in it at their Co∣ronation. The Prophecy is supposed to have been fulfilled in the Person of James the Sixth of Scotland, and First of England, from whom his present Majesty King George the Third is de∣scended in a direct line. <HI>See the</HI> Frontispiece, A.</NOTE>, covered all over with Cloth of <HI>Gold,</HI> was placed upon the <HI>North</HI> Side of the <HI>Altar,</HI> a little lower, than that belonging to the Archbishop; but something nearer the Middle of the Isle, and between the <HI>King's Chair</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> and the <HI>Pulpit.</HI></P>
<P>Near the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> stood the <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>Jewel House,</HI> and the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Nobility not formerly named, who were seated upon Forms round about the inside of the <HI>Stage,</HI> when Sermon began, drew near to that Side thereof, which faced the High <HI>Altar</HI> and stood there.</P>
<P>On the Corners of the <HI>Stage,</HI> near the High <HI>Altar,</HI> adjoining to the two uppermost Pillars, were Places railed in, for the Provincial Kings, Heralds, and Pursuivants.</P>
<P>The Serjeants at Arms, being sixteen in Number, stood with their Maces on their Shoulders, within the Rails, on either Side the Entrance of the <HI>Stage</HI> from the <HI>Choir.</HI></P>
<P>Over the Door, at the <HI>West</HI> End of the <HI>Choir,</HI> stood the Drums and Trumpets.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="20"/>
<HI>Sermon</HI> being ended, the KING uncovered his <HI>Head,</HI> and immedi∣ately the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> arose from his Seat, drew near unto the KING'S <HI>Chair</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> and asked him his <HI>Willingness</HI> to take the <HI>Oath,</HI> usually taken by his <HI>Predecessors.</HI></P>
<P>The KING assenting thereunto,</P>
<P>The Bishop then administred the following <HI>Questions,</HI> which the KING answered severally.<Q><P><HI>Bishop.</HI> SIR, Will you grant and keep, and by your Oath confirm, to the People of <HI>England,</HI> the Laws and Customs to them granted, by the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> your lawful and Religious Predecessors; and namely the Laws, Customs, and Franchises, granted to the Clergy, by the glorious King <HI>St. Edward</HI> your Predecessor, according to the Laws of GOD, the true Profession of the Gospel established in this Kingdom, agreeable to the Prerogative of the Kings thereof, and the ancient Customs of this Realm?</P>
<P><HI>King.</HI> I grant and promise to keep them.</P>
<P><HI>Bishop</HI> Will you keep Peace, and Godly Agreement, according to your Power, both to GOD, the Holy Church, the Clergy, and the People?</P>
<P><HI>King.</HI> I will keep it.</P>
<P><HI>Bishop.</HI> Will you (to your Power) cause Law, Justice, and Discre∣tion in Mercy and Truth; to be executed to your Judgment?</P>
<P><HI>King.</HI> I will.</P>
<P><HI>Bishop.</HI> SIR, Will you grant to hold and keep, the Laws and rightful Cus∣toms, which the Commonalty of this your Kingdom have? And will you defend and uphold them, to the Honour of GOD, so much as in you lieth?</P>
<P><HI>King.</HI> I grant and promise so to do.</P></Q></P>
<P>Then the Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI> read the Bishops <HI>Petition</HI> to the KING as follows. <Q>Our LORD and KING, We beseech you to pardon us, and to grant and to preserve unto us, and to the Churches committed to our Charge, all Ca∣nonical Privileges, and due Law and Justice, and that you would protect and defend us, as every good King, in his Kingdom, ought to be Protector and Defender of the Bishops and the Churches, under their Government.</Q></P>
<P>To which the <HI>King</HI> answered in the following Words: <Q>With a willing and devout Heart, I promise and grant my Pardon, and that I will preserve and maintain to you, and the Churches committed to your Charge, all Canonical Privileges, and due Law and Justice, and that I will be your Protector and Defender to my Power, by the Assistance of God, as every good King in his Kingdom in Right ought to protect and defend the Bishops and Churches under their Government.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21"/>
Then the KING, assisted by the Bishops of <HI>Durham,</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> was led from his <HI>Chair</HI> to the <HI>Altar;</HI> the <HI>Sword</HI> of <HI>State</HI> being born before <HI>him,</HI> and the Lord Great Chamberlain attending, where he took the following <HI>Oath,</HI> in Sight of all present, laying his <HI>Hand</HI> upon the BIBLE. <Q>The things which I have here promised, I shall perform and keep, so help me GOD, and the Contents of this Book.</Q></P>
<P>The KING was then led back, in like Manner, to his <HI>Chair</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> and immediately the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and the <HI>Choir</HI> begun the <HI>Hymn</HI> VENI, CREATOR SPIRITUS.</P>
<P>And a little before the ending thereof, the <HI>Faldstool</HI> was set again at the <HI>King's Right Hand,</HI> whereat as soon as the <HI>Hymn</HI> was finished, he kneeled; the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> standing before him, and saying the following <HI>Prayer:</HI><Q>We beseech Thee, O LORD, Holy Father, Almighty and Everlasting GOD, for this thy Servant CHARLES, that, as at first thou didst bring him into the World by thy Divine Providence, and through the Flower of his Age has preserved him unto this present Day; so thou wouldst evermore enrich him with thy Bounty, and fill him with Grace and Truth, and daily increase in him all Goodness, in the Sight of GOD and Man; that being placed in the Throne of Supreme Government, assisted by thy heavenly Grace, and by thy Mercy defended from all his Enemies; He may govern the People committed to his Charge, in Wealth, Peace, and Godliness, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD. AMEN.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Prayer</HI> ended, the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> went to the <HI>North</HI> Side of the <HI>Altar,</HI> the KING still kneeling, and forthwith the Bishops of <HI>Pe∣terborough</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Dr. Benjamin Laney.</NOTE> and <HI>Gloucester</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Dr. William Nicholson.</NOTE>, went and kneeled on the upper <HI>Haut Pace</HI> of the <HI>Altar,</HI> where they began the <HI>Litany,</HI> the <HI>Choirs</HI> singing the <HI>Responses,</HI> the <HI>Dean</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> kneeling all the while at the <HI>King's left Hand.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Litany,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> said the three following <HI>Prayers,</HI> at the <HI>North</HI> Side of the <HI>Altar:</HI> <Q>Almighty and Everlasting GOD, Creator of all Things, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Give Ear, we beseech Thee, unto our humble Prayers, and multiply thy Blessings upon this thy Servant CHARLES, whom, in thy Name, with lowly Devotion, we consecrate our KING. Grant, that by thy Inspiration he may govern with the Mildness of SOLOMON, and enjoy a peaceable Kingdom. Grant that he may serve Thee with Fear, and fight

for Thee with Constancy. Defend him by thy mighty Arm, compass him with thy Protection, and enable him to overcome all his Enemies. Honour him before all the Kings of the Earth. Let him rule over Countries, and let Nations how down before him. Establish his Throne with Judgment and Equity. Let Justice flourish in his Days; and grant, that he, supported by the due Obedience and hearty Love of his People, may sit on the Throne of his Fathers many Years, and, after this transitory Life, may reign with <HI>Thee</HI> in thine everlasting Kingdom, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour. Amen.</HI></Q><Q>GOD, the unspeakable Author of the World, Creator of Men, Governor of Empires, and Establisher of all Kingdoms; who, out of the Loins of our Father <HI>Abraham,</HI> didst chuse a <HI>King,</HI> that became the <HI>Saviour</HI> of all Kings and Nations of the Earth; Bless, we beseech Thee, thy faithful Servant and our dread Sovereign Lord <HI>King Charles,</HI> with the richest Blessings of thy Grace, Establish him in the Throne of his Kingdom by thy mighty Aid and Protection, Visit him, as thou didst <HI>Moses</HI> in the Bush, <HI>Joshua</HI> in the Bat∣tle, <HI>Gideon</HI> in the Field, and <HI>Samuel</HI> in the Temple. Let the Dew of thine abundant Mercies fall upon his Head, and give him the Blessing of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI> Be unto him an Helmet of Salvation against the Face of his Enemies, and a strong Tower of Defence in the Time of Adver∣sity. Let his Reign be prosperous, and his Days many. Let Peace, and Love, and Holiness, let Justice and Truth and all Christian Virtues flourish in his Time. Let his People serve him with Honour and Obedience; And let him so duly serve thee here on Earth, that he may hereafter ever∣lastingly reign with <HI>Thee</HI> in Heaven, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our <HI>Lord. Amen.</HI></Q><Q>GOD, which providest for thy People by thy Power, and rulest over them in Love, grant unto this thy Servant <HI>Charles,</HI> the Spirit of Wisdom and Government, that, being devoted unto <HI>Thee,</HI> he may so wisely govern his Kingdom, that, in his Time, the Church may be in Safety, and Christian Devotion continue in Peace, that so persevering to the End in good Works, he may, by thy Mercy, come unto thine Everlasting Kingdom, through thy Son <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our <HI>Lord,</HI> who liveth and reigneth with Thee, World without End. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A little before the last <HI>Prayer</HI> was ended, the Archbishop of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> came out at the <HI>North</HI> Door of <HI>St. Edward's</HI> Chapel, vested in a rich <HI>Cope,</HI> and at the Conclusion thereof he began the <HI>Versicle.</HI><Q><P>Lift up your Hearts!</P>


<P><HI>Resp.</HI> We lift them up to the <HI>Lord.</HI></P>




<P><PB N="15" REF="23"/><HI>Archbishop.</HI> Let us give Thanks, unto the <HI>Lord</HI> our <HI>God.</HI></P>



<P><HI>Resp.</HI> It is meet and right so to do.</P>


<P><HI>Archbishop.</HI> It is very meet and right, and our bounden Duty, that we should at all Times, and in all Places, give Thanks unto thee, O <HI>Lord,</HI> Holy Father, Almighty and everlasting GOD, the Strength of thy Chosen, and the Exalter of the Humble, which in the beginning, by the pouring out of the Flood, didst chasten the Sins of the World, and, by a Dove conveying an Olive Branch, didst give a Token of Reconcilement unto the Earth, and again didst consecrate thy Servant <HI>Aaron</HI> a Priest, by the anointing of Oil, and afterwards, by the Effusion of this Oil, didst make Priests, and Kings, and Prophets, to govern thy People <HI>Israel,</HI> and, by the Voice of the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> didst foretel, that the Countenance of thy Church should be made chearful with Oil. We beseech Thee, Almighty Father, that thou wilt vouchsafe to bless and sanctify this thy Servant <HI>Charles,</HI> that he may minis∣ter Peace unto his People, <HI>imitate</HI> Aaron in thy Service and That he may attain the Perfection of Government in Counsel and Judgment, through <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> our <HI>Lord.</HI> Amen.</P></Q></P>
<P>This finished, the KING arose from the <HI>Faldstool,</HI> and went to the <HI>Altar,</HI> supported by the aforesaid Bishops of <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> where he was disrobed by the Lord Great Chamberlain of his <HI>Royal Robes,</HI> which were immediately carried thence, into the <HI>Traverse</HI> erected in <HI>St. Edward</HI>'s Chapel.</P>
<P>While this was doing, the <HI>Chair,</HI> that was before placed at the En∣trance of the Stage, was removed and set on the <HI>North</HI> Side of the <HI>Al∣tar,</HI> between it and <HI>St. Edward's Chair;</HI> whereunto the KING came, sat down, and was anointed by the said Archbishop, while the <HI>Dean</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> held the AMPULLA<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">The Ampulla is in the Form of an Eagle, with Wings expanded standing on a Pedestal, all of pure Gold, weighing about ten Ounces. The Eagle being hollow, unscrews in the Middle of the Neck, for the more easy putting in the Oil, which, when the King is anointed, is poured through the Beak. The French have an Ampulla, which is said to have been brought from Hea∣ven by a white Dove, and which is kept in the Abby of S Remi, from whence it is brought in great Ceremony when the most Christian King is crowned at Rheims In regard to this, our Po∣pish Ancestors were not behind; for the Reader may find, in Thomas Walsingham, that the Blessed Virgin gave to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, being then in Exile, a Holy Eagle full of Oil in a Stone Vessel, which he deposited in a Monastery at Poitiers. There, in the Reign of Edward III Henry I. Duke of Lancaster received it from a holy Man, who found it by a second Revelation. The Duke gave it to the Black Prince, who placed it in a strong Chest in the Tower, where his Son Richard the Second, searching for his Father's Jewels, met with it, and pressed the Archbishop of Canterbury to anoint him therewith; but the Archbishop told him, he had been once anointed, and that this Royal Unction could not be repeated. The King carried it over to Ireland, and at his Return from thence gave it to the Archbishop, who therewith anointed Henry the Fourth. In <HI>Sandford's History of the Coronation of James the Second,</HI> we are told, the Oil for that Monarch's Coronation was prepared by his Order, by James St. Amand, Esq. Apo∣thecary to that Prince, and which was solemnly consecrated the Morning of the Coronation by the Dean of Westminster, assisted by the Prebendaries. It was so exceeding rich and fragrant, and so highly approved of by the King and Queen, that he had two hundred Pounds paid him for it by the Treasurer of the Household, in Consequence of a Warrant from the Lord Chamberlain.</NOTE> and poured the <HI>Oil</HI> into the
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
<HI>Spoon,</HI> first in the <HI>Palm</HI> of <HI>both</HI> his <HI>Hands,</HI> in manner of a <HI>Cross,</HI> the Archbishop as he anointed <HI>him</HI> pronouncing these Words:<Q>Let these Hands be anointed with Holy Oil, as Kings and Prophets have been anointed, and as <HI>Samuel</HI> did anoint <HI>David</HI> to be King; that thou mayest be blessed and established a King in this Kingdom, over the People whom the <HI>Lord</HI> thy <HI>God</HI> hath given Thee, to rule and govern. Which He vouchsafe to grant, who with the Father and the Holy Ghost, three in Per∣son, and one in Unity, reigns in Glory everlasting. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After which, the <HI>Choir</HI> sung this <HI>Anthem:</HI><Q><HI>Sadoc</HI> the Priest, and <HI>Nathan</HI> the Prophet, anointed <HI>Solomon</HI> King: and all the People rejoiced, and said, GOD SAVE THE KING.</Q></P>
<P>At the End of which <HI>Anthem,</HI> the Archbishop said this <HI>Prayer</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is very remarkable that these Prayers, and even the Anthem, made a Part of the Cere∣mony used in the Coronation of our <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings near a thousand Years ago, as appears by a Frag∣ment of their Pontifical still remaining.</NOTE>: <Q>Look down, Almighty GOD, with thy favourable Countenance upon this thy Servant and dread Sovereign, <HI>King Charles,</HI> and as thou didst bless <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> so vouchsafe, we beseech Thee, to water Him plentifully with the Blessings of thy Grace. Give unto Him of the Dew of Heaven, and of the Fatness of the Earth, abundance of Corn, Wine, and Oil, with Plenty of Fruits and other good Things. Grant him long to reign, and that in his Time there may be Health and Peace in this King∣dom. Grant, O <HI>Lord,</HI> that he may be a mighty Protector of this Nation, a bountiful Comforter of Churches, the most valiant of Monarchs, terrible to Rebels, amiable to his Nobles, and all his faithful Subjects. Make his Royal Court to shine in Princely Dignity, as a most clear Lightning, far and wide in the Eyes of all Men. Finally, let him be blessed with Children, that may reign as Kings after Him, and rule this Kingdom by Succession of all Ages; and after the glorious and happy Days of this present Life, give him, of thy Mercy, an everlasting Kingdom with thee in Heaven, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our <HI>Lord. Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And then proceeded with his anointing the KING'S <HI>Breast,</HI> between his <HI>Shoulders,</HI> on <HI>both</HI> his <HI>Shoulders,</HI> the <HI>Bowings</HI> of his <HI>Arms,</HI> and on the <HI>Crown</HI> of his <HI>Head,</HI> in manner aforesaid.</P>
<P>Which being done, the <HI>Anointing</HI> was dried up with fine <HI>Linen,</HI> and the <HI>Loops</HI> of his <HI>Shirt</HI> closed up by the Dean of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and then the Archbishop said these two <HI>Prayers:</HI> <Q><PB N="17" REF="25"/>
GOD, the <HI>Son</HI> of GOD, <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> our <HI>Lord!</HI> who is anointed of his Fa∣ther with the Oil of Gladness above his Fellows, pour down upon thy Head the Blessing of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and make it enter into thy Heart, so that thou may∣est receive invisible Grace; and, having justly governed thy temporal Kingdom, thou mayest reign with him eternally, who being without Sin, doth live in Glo∣ry, with GOD the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> for ever and ever.</Q>
<Q>GOD, which art the Glory of the Righteous, and the Saviour of Sinners, who hath sent thy Son to redeem Mankind with his Precious Blood, who bringest Wars to an End, and defendest those that trust in Thee; upon whose good Will and Pleasure doth depend the Strength of all Kingdoms; we humbly pray, in this Royal Seat, to bless this thy Servant, who putteth his Confidence in thy Mer∣cy. Vouchsafe in thy Favour to be present with him, that he, which desireth to be defended by thy Protection, may be stronger than his Enemies. Crown him with the Crown of Justice and Piety, that with all his Heart and all his Mind he may trust in thee, serve thee, defend and advance thy Holy Church, and govern the People committed to his Charge, in Justice and Equity. Kindle, O <HI>Lord,</HI> his Heart with the Love of thy Grace, by the inward Anointing wherewith thou hast anointed Priests, Kings, and Prophets; that be, loving Justice, and leading his People by the Ways of Righteousness, after the glorious Course of this Life, which thou hast appointed, may come to Eternal Joy, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our <HI>Lord. Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>During the time of <HI>Unction,</HI> a rich <HI>Pall</HI> os <HI>Cloth</HI> of <HI>Gold,</HI> brought from the great Wardrobe by Mr. <HI>Rumball</HI> was held over the <HI>King's Head,</HI> by the Dukes of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Albemarle,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Berks</HI> and <HI>Sandwich,</HI> as <HI>Knights</HI> of the most noble <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Garter.</HI></P>
<P>After these <HI>Prayers,</HI> the Lord Great Chamberlain delivered the <HI>Coif</HI> to the Archbishop, who put it on the <HI>King's Head,</HI> and immediately after the Dean of Westminster, put the <HI>Colobium Sindonis</HI> or <HI>Surplice</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This is a Garment of white Cambrick without Sleeves, laced about the Neck, Arm-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, down the Breast, upon the Slits, on the Sides, and round the Bottom, with very fine Lace.</NOTE>, upon the <HI>King.</HI> Whereupon the Archbishop (the <HI>King</HI> thus clothed) said this short <HI>Prayer:</HI> <Q>O GOD, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, in thy favour, to bless this Kingly Ornament, and grant that thy Servant <HI>Charles</HI> our <HI>King,</HI> who shall wear it, may shine in thy Sight, with the Ornament of a good Life and Holy Actions, and after this Life ended, he may for ever enjoy that Life and Glory, which hath no End, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our <HI>Lord.</HI> Amen.</Q></P>
<P>This said, the Dean of Westminster, having likewise fetched the Tissue <HI>Hose</HI> and <HI>Sandals</HI> from the <HI>Altar,</HI> he arrayed the KING therewith, as also
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
with the <HI>Super Tunica</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>coat is close, with plain Sleeves of a very thick and rich Cloth of Gold Tissue. The Length behind is a Yard, Quarter and half, and before a Yard and Quarter, below which the Colobium reaches about a Nail. To this Surcoat belongs a Belt of the same Cloth of Gold Tissue, with a Gold Buckle, to which the King's Sword is fastened with which he is girded.</NOTE> or Close <HI>Pall</HI> of Cloth Cloth of <HI>Gold,</HI> and girded the same about <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Taffety</HI> and <HI>Shirt</HI> was not used.</P>
<P>After all, the Dean took the <HI>Spurs</HI> from off the <HI>Altar,</HI> and delivered them to the Lord Great Chamberlain, who touched the KING'S <HI>Heels</HI> therewith, and forthwith sent them back to the <HI>Altar.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Archbishop received the <HI>Sword</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> in the <HI>Scabbard</HI> from the Lord Chamberlain of the Houshold, and laid it upon the <HI>Altar,</HI> say∣ing this <HI>Prayer:</HI> <Q>Hear our Prayers we beseech Thee O <HI>Lord!</HI> and vouchsafe by thy Right Hand of Majesty, to bless and sanctify this Sword, wherewith this thy Servant <HI>Charles</HI> defireth to be girt, that it may be a Defence and Protection, of Church∣es, Widows, and Orphans, and all thy Servants; and a Terror to all those, that lie in wait to do mischief, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our <HI>Lord. Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This <HI>Prayer</HI> finished, the Archbishop and Bishops assisting, delivered the <HI>Sword</HI> back to the KING, saying, <HI>Accipe Gladium, per Manus Episco∣porum</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">This seems, from the Fragment beforementioned, to have been a Part of the old Saxon Ceremonial.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Lord Great Chamberlain <HI>girt</HI> it about the KING, and the Archbishop said, <Q>Receive this <HI>Kingly Sword,</HI> which is hallowed for the Defence of the <HI>Holy Church,</HI> and delivered unto Thee, by the Hands of the Bishops, though un∣worthy, yet consecrated by the Authority of the <HI>Holy Apostles,</HI> and remember of whom the <HI>Psalmist</HI> did Prophesy, saying, <HI>Gird thyself with thy Sword, upon thy Thigh, O thou most mighty,</HI> and with this Sword exercise thou the force of Equity, and mightily destroy the growth of Iniquity. Protect the Holy Church of GOD, and his faithful People. Defend and help Widows and Orphans. Restore things gone to Decay, and maintain those that are restored; that doing thus, thou mayest be <HI>glorious</HI> in the triumph of <HI>Virtue,</HI> and excellent in the Ornament of <HI>Justice;</HI> and <HI>Reign</HI> for ever, with the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> whose <HI>Image</HI> you bear, who with the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> liveth and reigneth World without End.</Q></P>
<P>After this, the Dean of <HI>Westminster</HI> took the <HI>Armill</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">This is made of the same Cloth of Tissue as the Surcoat, lined with Crimson Sarsenet; in Length it is about an Ell, and in Breadth three Inches, with two double Ribbands at each End for the more convenient tying it above and below the Elbows.</NOTE>, made of Cloth of <HI>Tissue,</HI> and put it about the KING'S <HI>Neck,</HI> and <HI>tied</HI> it to the <HI>Bowings</HI> of his <HI>Arms,</HI> the Archbishop standing before the KING, with the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> on his Right Hand, and saying. <Q><PB N="19" REF="27"/>
Receive the Armill of Sincerity and Wisdom, as a Token of GOD'S embra∣cing, whereby all thy Works may be defended against thine Enemies, both bodi∣ly and ghostly, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our <HI>Lord.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Next the <HI>Mantle</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">This is likewise stiled Dalmatica, and answers to the Imperial Cloak, being of Gold and Pur∣ple brocaded Tissue, adorned with large Flowers of Gold frosted.</NOTE> or open <HI>Pall,</HI> being made of Cloth of <HI>Gold</HI> and lined with <HI>red Taffety,</HI> was put upon <HI>him</HI> by the said Dean, the Archbishop likewise using the Words of Signification, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Receive this Pall, which is formed with four Corners, to let thee understand that the four Corners of the World are subject to the Power of GOD, and that no Man can happily reign upon Earth, who hath not received his Authority from Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>In the next Place, the Archbishop took <HI>St. Edward's Crown,</HI> and <HI>blessed it,</HI> saying<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">This also appears to have been taken from the old Saxon Pontifical.</NOTE>, <Q>GOD the Crown of the Faithful, who on the Heads of thy Saints placeth Crowns of Glory; bless and sanctify this <HI>Crown,</HI> that as the same is adorned with divers precious Stones, so this thy Servant, wearing it, may be replenished of thy Grace with the manifold Gifts of all precious Virtues, through the King eternal, thy Son our <HI>Lord. Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the mean Time <HI>St. Edward's Chair</HI> was removed into the Middle of the Isle, and set right over against the <HI>Altar,</HI> whither the KING went and <HI>sat</HI> down in it; and then the Archbishop brought <HI>St. Edward's Crown</HI> from the <HI>Altar,</HI> and put it upon his <HI>Head.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon all the <HI>People,</HI> with <HI>loud</HI> and <HI>repeated Shouts,</HI> cried, GOD SAVE THE KING. And by a <HI>Signal</HI> then <HI>given,</HI> the great <HI>Ordinance</HI> from the <HI>Tower</HI> were also discharged.</P>
<P>At the <HI>ceasing</HI> of these <HI>Acclamations,</HI> the Archbishop went on, saying, <Q>GOD crown thee with a Crown of Glory and Righteousness, with the Honour and Virtue of Fortitude; that, by a right Faith and manifold Fruits of good Works, thou mayest obtain the Crown of an everlasting Kingdom, by the Gift of him whose Kingdom endureth for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Adding thereunto this <HI>Prayer:</HI> <Q>O GOD of Eternity, the Commander of all Powers, the Vanquisher of all Enemies; Bless this thy Servant, who <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">At which Words the King bowed his Head.</NOTE> boweth his Head unto thy Majesty; preserve him in Health and prosperous Felicity; be present with him whensoever he calleth upon thee; give him, we beseeth Thee, the Riches of thy Grace, fill his Soul with Goodness, and crown him with thy Mercy, and let him always in godly Devotion wait upon Thee, through thy Son our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After the <HI>Prayer,</HI> the Archbishop read the <HI>Conforture:</HI> <Q><PB N="20" REF="28"/>
Be strong and of a good Courage, and observe the Commandments of the Lord, to walk in his Ways, and keep his Ceremonies, Precepts, Testimonies, and Judgments; and Almighty GOD prosper and strengthen thee, whither soever thou goest. The Lord is my Ruler, therefore I shall want nothing.</Q></P>
<P>In the mean Time, the <HI>Choir</HI> sung this <HI>Anthem:</HI><Q>The KING shall <HI>rejoice</HI> in thy <HI>Strength,</HI> O LORD; <HI>exceeding glad</HI> shall <HI>he be</HI> of thy <HI>Salvation:</HI> for <HI>Thou</HI> hast <HI>granted him</HI> his <HI>Heart's Desire,</HI> and hast not <HI>denied him</HI> the <HI>Request</HI> of his <HI>Lips;</HI> for <HI>Thou</HI> hast <HI>prevented him</HI> with <HI>Blessings</HI> of <HI>Goodness,</HI> and hast <HI>set a Crown</HI> of pure <HI>Gold</HI> upon his <HI>Head.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon this, the <HI>Dukes, Marquisses, Earls,</HI> and <HI>Viscounts,</HI> put on their <HI>Coronets;</HI> the <HI>Barons</HI> their <HI>Caps</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">In the Month of August following, the King was graciously pleased to grant, that in all future Coronations, and on other public Occasions, the Barons of this Realm should use a Crimson Silken Cap, with a Circle of Gold, having fix Pearls disposed at equal Distances thereon; and King James the Second, in the First Year of his Reign, granted them further to wear Robes of Velvet, instead of those of Cloth, which they had worn hitherto.</NOTE>, and divers of them came and stood about the KING, who still <HI>sat</HI> in <HI>St. Edward's Chair.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Garter</HI> and the other <HI>Kings</HI> at <HI>Arms,</HI> put on their <HI>Crowns</HI> likewise.</P>
<P>Then the Master of the Jewel House, delivered to the Archbishop the <HI>Ring</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">This Coronation Ring is of Gold, with a large Table Ruby Violet, wherein a Cross of St. George is curiously enchased.</NOTE>, who consecrated it after this manner, saying,<Q>Bless, O <HI>Lord,</HI> and sanctify this Ring, that thy Servant, wearing it, may be sealed with the Ring of Faith, and by the Power of the Highest, be preserved from Sin; and let all the Blessings, which are found in Holy Scripture, plenti∣fully descend upon him, that whatsoever he shall sanctify, may be holy; and whatsoever he blesseth, may be blessed. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After which he <HI>put</HI> it upon the <HI>fourth Finger</HI> of the <HI>King's Right Hand,</HI> and said, <Q>Receive this Ring of kingly Dignity, and by it the Seal of Catholic Faith; that as this Day thou art consecrated, the Head and Prince of this Kingdom and People, so thou mayest preserve, as the Author and Establisher of Christianity, the Christian Faith; that being rich in Faith, and happy in good Works, thou mayest reign with him, that is King of Kings, to whom be Honour and Glory for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And then began this <HI>Prayer:</HI> <Q>O GOD, to whom belongeth all Power and Dignity, give unto thy Servant <HI>Charles</HI> the Fruit of his Dignity, wherein grant he may long continue, and fear Thee always, and always labour to please Thee, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our <HI>Lord.

When this <HI>Prayer</HI> was finished, the <HI>Linen Gloves</HI> were delivered to the KING, by the Lord Great Chamberlain, who going to the <HI>Altar, ungirt</HI> his <HI>Sword,</HI> and <HI>offered</HI> it at the <HI>Altar</HI> in the <HI>Scabbard,</HI> which being <HI>re∣deemed</HI> by the Lord Chamberlain of the Household, was <HI>drawn out</HI> of the <HI>Scabbard,</HI> and <HI>carried naked</HI> by <HI>him,</HI> all the following <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>So∣lemnity.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Archbishop took the <HI>Scepter</HI> with the <HI>Cross</HI> from <HI>off</HI> the <HI>Altar,</HI> and delivered it into the KING'S <HI>Right Hand</HI> saying, <Q>Receive this Scepter, the Sign of Kingly Power, the Rod of Kingdoms, the Rod of Virtue, that thou govern thyself aright, and defend the Holy Church and Christian People committed by GOD unto thy Charge; punish the Wicked, and protect the Just, and lead them in the Ways of Righteousness, that from this temporal Kingdom, thou mayest be advanced to an eternal King∣dom, by his Goodness whose Kingdom is everlasting. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Whilst this was <HI>pronounced</HI> by the Archbishop, Mr. <HI>Henry Howard delivered</HI> to the KING, a rich <HI>Glove</HI> which he <HI>put</HI> on his <HI>right Hand,</HI> and then <HI>received</HI> the <HI>Scepter.</HI> And after that, the Archbishop said this <HI>Prayer.</HI><Q>O LORD the Fountain of all good Things, and the Author of all good Pro∣ceedings, grant, we beseech Thee, to this thy Servant CHARLES, that he may order aright, the Dignity which he hath obtained.

<HI>GOD even thy GOD hath anointed thee with the Oil of Gladness above thy Fellows;</HI> even JESUS CHRIST our LORD. AMEN.</Q></P>

<P>Then the KING arose, and set himself again in <HI>St. Edward's Chair,</HI> whilst the Archbishop and Bishops present, one after another <HI>kneeled be∣fore him,</HI> and were <HI>kissed by him.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, the <HI>King's Chair</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> wherein he was anointed, was set above the <HI>upper Steps</HI> at the <HI>Entrance</HI> upon the <HI>Theatre,</HI> whither the KING went as soon as he had performed the Ceremony of kissing the Bi∣shops; having now four Swords born naked before him, the Archbishop, Bishops, and great Officers attending. At his Arrival there, the Arch∣bishop said this <HI>Prayer,</HI> the KING <HI>kneeling.</HI><Q>Grant, O LORD, that the Clergy and People, gathered together by thy Ordi∣nance, for this Service of the King, may, by the most gracious Assistance of thy Goodness, and the vigilant Care of thy Servant our King, be continually govern∣ed and preserved in all Happiness, and that they, obeying thy holy Will, may be freed from all Adversities, and enjoying the Riches of thy Grace, may with fer∣vent Love, walk in the Ways of thy Commandments, that, in this Life being made Partakers of thy Peace, they may be Citizens of thy Kingdom, in the Life to come, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD. AMEN.</Q></P>
<P>Then the KING arose, and reposed himself in his <HI>Chair,</HI> whilst both the <HI>Choirs</HI> sung TE DEUM.</P>
<P>When <HI>Te Deum</HI> was ended, the KING <HI>ascended</HI> his <HI>Throne,</HI> placed in the Middle of the <HI>Theatre,</HI> the Swords and great Officers standing on either Side, as also the Bishops, some in Copes, others in Rochets, the Arch∣bishop then saying,<Q>Stand and hold fast from henceforth that Place of Royal Dignity, whereof thou art the lawful and undoubted Heir by Succession, from thy Forefathers, being now delivered unto thee, by the Authority of Almighty GOD, by the Hands of us and all the Bishops and Servants of GOD; and as thou seest the Clergy approach nearer unto the Altar, so remember that in Places suitable, thou give them greater Honour, that the Mediator of God and Man, may establish thee in this Kingly Throne, to be the Mediator between the Clergy and Laity; that thou mayest reign for ever, with JESUS CHRIST, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who with the Father and the Holy Ghost, liveth and reign∣eth World without End.

<P>After this, the Bishops and Nobility did their <HI>Homage</HI> to the KING, in manner following,</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31"/>
And first the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury kneeled down</HI> before the <HI>King's Knees,</HI> and said,<Q>I, <HI>William</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Dr. William Juxon who deceased October 27, 1663.</NOTE> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> shall be faithful and true, and Faith and Truth bear unto you, our Sovereign Lord, and your Heirs Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and shall do and truly acknowledge the Service of the Land, which I claim to hold of You, in the Right of the Church. So help me GOD.</Q></P>
<P>Which said, he <HI>kissed</HI> the <HI>King's left Cheek.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>like</HI> did all the <HI>other Bishops</HI> that were present.</P>
<P>Then came up the <HI>Duke</HI> of YORK, with <HI>Garter</HI> Principal <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Arms</HI> before him, and his <HI>Train</HI> born by two Gentlemen, who being arrived at the <HI>Throne kneeled</HI> down before the KING, put off his <HI>Coronet,</HI> and did his <HI>Homage.</HI> At which the <HI>Drums</HI> beat, <HI>Trumpets</HI> sounded, and all the <HI>People</HI> shouted.</P>
<P>The <HI>like</HI> did the Dukes of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Albemarle,</HI> for <HI>themselves</HI> and the <HI>rest</HI> of the <HI>Dukes.</HI></P>
<P>So also did the Marquisses of <HI>Worcester</HI> and <HI>Dorchester.</HI></P>
<P>Next the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> did <HI>Homage</HI> after the same manner, for himself and all the <HI>rest</HI> of the <HI>Earls,</HI> who attended upon him, to <HI>signify</HI> their <HI>Consent.</HI></P>
<P>After him, Viscount <HI>Hereford,</HI> did the like for himself and the <HI>rest</HI> of the <HI>Viscounts;</HI> and then the <HI>Drums</HI> beat, and <HI>Trumpets</HI> sounded.</P>
<P>Lastly Baron <HI>Audley,</HI> in like manner, did <HI>Homage</HI> for himself and all the <HI>Barons;</HI> who also accompanied him, to the <HI>Throne,</HI> to <HI>signify</HI> their <HI>Consent;</HI> which being finished, <HI>Drums, Trumpets,</HI> and <HI>Shouts</HI> followed.</P>
<P>The Words of Homage, uttered by such of the Nobility as kneeled down, were,<Q>I, <HI>M. M.</HI> do become your Liege Man, of Life and Limb, and of earthly Worship; and of Faith and Truth I shall bear unto you, to live and die against all manner of Folks. So help me GOD.</Q></P>
<P>Afterwards, the <HI>Duke</HI> of YORK, and all the Nobility, <HI>singly ascended</HI> the <HI>Throne,</HI> and <HI>touched</HI> the <HI>King's Crown,</HI> promising by that <HI>Ceremony,</HI> to be ever ready to <HI>support it,</HI> with all their <HI>Power.</HI></P>
<P>During the Performance of this <HI>solemn Ceremony,</HI> the Lord High Chan∣cellor went to the <HI>South, West,</HI> and <HI>North</HI> Sides of the <HI>Stage,</HI> and <HI>proclaim∣ed</HI> to the <HI>People,</HI> the <HI>King's</HI> GENERAL PARDON, being attended by <HI>Gar∣ter</HI> to the <HI>South Side,</HI> and by a <HI>Gentleman Usher,</HI> and two <HI>Heralds,</HI> to the <HI>other</HI> two Sides.</P>
<P>And at these <HI>three Sides</HI> at the same Time, did the Lord <HI>Cornwallis,</HI> Treasurer of his Majesty's Household, fling abroad the <HI>Medals</HI> both of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver,</HI> prepared for the <HI>Coronation,</HI> as a Princely <HI>Donation</HI> or <HI>Largess</HI> among the <HI>People.</HI></P>

The KING being thus enthronized, the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of his <HI>Chapel</HI> began this <HI>Anthem:</HI><Q><P>Behold; O LORD our <HI>Defender,</HI> and <HI>look upon</HI> the <HI>Face</HI> of <HI>thine anointed.</HI></P><P>The LORD GOD is a <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Defence.</HI> The LORD will give <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> and <HI>no good Thing</HI> will be <HI>withold from them,</HI> that live a <HI>Godly Life.</HI></P>
<P>O LORD GOD of <HI>Hosts!</HI> Blessed is the <HI>Man,</HI> who putteth his <HI>Trust</HI> in <HI>thee.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>In the mean Time, the KING took off his <HI>Crown,</HI> and delivered it to the Lord High Chamberlain, to hold; the <HI>Scepter</HI> with the <HI>Cross</HI> to Mr. <HI>Henry Howard,</HI> and <HI>that</HI> with the <HI>Dove,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Albemarle.</HI></P>

<P>All which Time, the KING stood by his <HI>Throne.</HI></P>
<P>But, towards the End of the Creed, he again took his Crown from the Lord Great Chamberlain, and put it on his Head, as also the Scepter with the Cross from Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> and that with the Dove, from the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and prepared for his Descent from his Throne, to∣wards the <HI>Altar,</HI> to <HI>receive</HI> the <HI>Communion.</HI></P>
<P>And as soon as the singing of the <HI>Creed</HI> was fully ended, the KING descended with the <HI>Crown</HI> on his <HI>Head,</HI> and <HI>Scepters</HI> in both <HI>Hands,</HI> the Bishops of <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI> supporting him, with the four Swords naked before, and all the great Officers of State attending.</P>
<P>During the Time of this <HI>Proceeding,</HI> the <HI>Choir</HI> sung,<Q>Let my <HI>Prayer</HI> come up unto thy <HI>Presence,</HI> as the <HI>Incense;</HI> and the lifting up of my <HI>Hands,</HI> be as an <HI>Evening Sacrifice.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> retired from the Ceremonies into <HI>St. Edward's</HI> Chapel, and thence went home, leaving the Remainder of his Duty to be performed by the Bishop of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>At the KING'S Approach to the <HI>Altar,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Ely</HI> delivered unto him <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> which he there <HI>offered,</HI> and then returned to the <HI>Faldstool</HI> on the <HI>South</HI> Side of the <HI>Altar,</HI> near his <HI>Chair</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> before which he <HI>kneeled</HI> down, and laid his <HI>Crown</HI> upon the <HI>Cushion</HI> before him, towards his <HI>right Hand;</HI> and the <HI>Scepter</HI> with the <HI>Dove</HI> on his <HI>left,</HI> and

<P>Then the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> said this <HI>Prayer:</HI><Q>Bless, O LORD, we beseech Thee, these thy Gifts, and sanctify them unto this holy Use; that by them, we may be made Partakers of the Body and Blood of thy only begotten Son, JESUS CHRIST.

<P>At the End of which, the Lord <HI>Cornwallis,</HI> Treasurer of the Houshold, presented the KING with another <HI>Wedge</HI> of <HI>Gold,</HI> which goeth under the <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>Mark</HI> of <HI>Gold.</HI> This the KING <HI>offered</HI> into the <HI>Bason, kneel∣ing</HI> still at his <HI>Faldstool,</HI> whilst the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> said the following <HI>Prayer:</HI><Q>Almighty GOD, give thee of the Dew of Heaven, and of the Fat of the Earth, and abundance of Corn and Wine.

<P>And next <HI>pronounced</HI> this <HI>Blessing:</HI><Q>Bless, O LORD, the virtuous Carriage of this KING, and accept the Work of his Hands; replenish his Realm with the Blessings of Heaven, of the Dew of the Water, and of the Deeps.

<P>In the mean while, the KING returned to his <HI>Throne,</HI> upon the <HI>Theatre,</HI> with the <HI>Crown</HI> on his Head, and the <HI>Scepters</HI> in his Hands.</P>
<P>When he came thither, he put off his <HI>Crown,</HI> and delivered it to the Lord Great Chamberlain; the <HI>Scepter</HI> with the <HI>Cross,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Howard;</HI> and that with the <HI>Dove,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Albemarle.</HI></P>

<P>The rest of the <HI>Regalia,</HI> which lay all this while on the Altar, being delivered to the Noblemen, that brought them in the <HI>Proceeding</HI> to the Church, were carried before him; and thence the KING proceeded into <HI>St. Edward's</HI> Chapel, the Organs playing all the while.</P>
<P>Where being arrived, he took off <HI>St. Edward's Crown,</HI> and delivered it to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who immediately laid it upon <HI>St. Edward's Altar;</HI> all the rest of the <HI>Regalia</HI> were given into the Hands of the Dean of <HI>West∣minster,</HI> and laid there also.</P>
<P>Afterwards, the KING entered into the <HI>Traverse,</HI> erected in the middle of the Wall, on the back side of the <HI>High Altar,</HI> and there retired whilst he was disrobed of <HI>St. Edward's Robes,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Seymour</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ashburn∣ham,</HI> Grooms of the Bedchamber, on the behalf of the Lord Great Cham∣berlain, which were laid on <HI>St. Edward's Altar,</HI> by the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> and afterwards delivered to the Dean of <HI>Westminster,</HI> to lay up with the <HI>Regalia.</HI></P>
<P>After this the KING was arrayed in his <HI>Purple Robes,</HI> and then came near to <HI>St. Edward's Altar,</HI> where the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> stood ready with the <HI>Imperial Crown</HI> in his Hands, and set it upon the <HI>King's Head,</HI> upon which the KING took the <HI>Scepter</HI> with the <HI>Cross</HI> in his <HI>right Hand,</HI> and the <HI>Globe</HI> in his <HI>left,</HI> and immediately the <HI>Proceeding</HI> began thence into <HI>West∣minster</HI>

The Kings of Arms marched likewise with their Crowns on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Proceeding</HI> being entered into <HI>Westminster Hall,</HI> the Nobility, and others who had Tables assigned them, went and placed themselves there∣at; but the KING, attended by the Great Officers, withdrew into the inner Court of Wards for half an Hour. In the mean Time, all the Tables in the Hall were served, before the <HI>King's</HI> Service came up, and were placed in this Manner:</P>
<P>On the right Hand of the King's Throne, below in the Hall, were set two Tables, one beneath the other. At the upper End of the first, next the State, which had two Side Tables to serve it, sat the Bishops, and be∣low them the Judges with the rest of the Long Robe.</P>
<P>At the second Table, which had two Side Board Tables likewise, to serve it, sat the Masters in Chancery, and the Six Clerks.</P>
<P>And here at this Table were the Barons of the Cinque Ports obliged to sit, through a Disturbance that happened, with which it is not necessary to trouble the Reader, although the upper End of the first Table was ap∣pointed for them.</P>
<P>Upon the left Hand of the King's Throne, below on the other Side of the Hall, was placed a long Table, whereat the Nobility dined, and this Table had four Side Tables to serve it.</P>
<P>And behind this, close to the Wall, at a shorter Table, sat the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder, and twelve Chief Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> who had also two Side Tables to serve them.</P>
<P>Lastly, was a Table, with one Side Table to serve it, set for the Offi∣cers of Arms, whereat they also dined. Each Table was furnished with three Courses, answerable to that of the King's, besides the Desert.</P>
<P>A little before the KING returned to Dinner, two Esquires of the Body<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">This was a very honourable Office in the King's Household, and of these there were anciently four, who, in their Turns, attended in the Day Time near the Person of the King, and in the Night near his Bed-chamber.</NOTE>, <HI>viz.

<HEAD>THE CEREMONY OF THE CORONATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Anointing, Crowning, and Inthroning of QUEEN MARY<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This Princess was Mary-Beatrice-Eleonora d'Este, Daughter of Alphonso Duke of Mo∣dena, and born in that City, September 25, 1658, married to James the Second, then Duke of York, in November 1673, by Dr. Nathaniel Crew, Bishop of Oxford, afterwards of Durham. She was crowned with that Monarch, April 23, 1685, and deceased at the Palace of St. Germain en Laye, in France, April 26, 1718.</NOTE>, Consort of KING JAMES the <HI>Second,</HI> with the Prayers at length, which are not to be found in <HI>Sandford</HI>'s large History.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Anthem</HI> being ended, the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> went to the Altar; and being there, the QUEEN arose from her <HI>Chair,</HI> on the <HI>South</HI> Side of the <HI>Area,</HI> where she had re∣posed herself, during the Time that the KING was Anointed, Crowned, and Inthronized; and being supported by the two Bi∣shops<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dr. Peter Mew, Bishop of Winchester, and Dr. Henry Compton, Bishop of London.</NOTE>, went towards the Altar, attended by the Duchess of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and the four Ladies Assistants, who constantly bore her <HI>Ma∣jesty's Train,</HI> together with the Ladies of the Bedchamber, and <HI>Kneeled</HI> down at the <HI>Steps</HI> of the <HI>Altar,</HI> the <HI>Carpets</HI> and <HI>Cushions</HI> being spread and laid there for <HI>Her,</HI> in like manner as they had been before for the KING.</P>
<P>Then the Archbishop, being at the <HI>North</HI> Side of the <HI>Altar,</HI> said this Prayer:<Q>Almighty and everlasting GOD, the Fountain of all Goodness, give Ear we beseech Thee, to our Prayers, and multiply thy Blessings upon this thy Servant, whom in thy Name, with all humble Devotion, we consecrate OUR QUEEN. Defend her always with thy mighty Hand, protect her on every Side, that she may be able to overcome all her Enemies; and that

with SARAH, and REBECCA, LEAH, <HI>and</HI> RACHEL, <HI>and other Blessed and Honourable Women,</HI> she may multiply and rejoice, in the Fruit of her Womb, to the Honour of the Kingdom, and the good Government of thy Church, through CHRIST our LORD, <HI>who vouchsafed to be born of a Virgin, that he might redeem the World,</HI> who liveth and reigneth with thee, in UNITY of the HOLY GHOST; World without End.</Q></P>
<P>This done the QUEEN arose, and went to the <HI>Faldstool,</HI> at which she was to be Anointed and Crowned, placed between King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Chair, and the Steps of the <HI>Altar;</HI> where the Countess of <HI>Peterbo∣rough,</HI> Groom of the Stole to her <HI>Majesty,</HI> with the two Ladies of the Bedchamber, assisted by the Queen's Women, took off her Rich <HI>Circle</HI> or <HI>Coronet.</HI></P>
<P>Then the QUEEN kneeled down, and the Archbishop poured the <HI>Holy Oil,</HI> on the Crown of her Head, in form of a <HI>Cross,</HI> using these Words.<Q>In the Name of the FATHER, the SON, and the HOLY GHOST, let the anointing of this Oil, increase thine Honour, and establish thee for ever and ever.</Q></P>
<P>After which, the same Lady assisted as before, opened her Appa∣rel, for the anointing her <HI>Majesty</HI> on the <HI>Breast;</HI> which the Arch∣bishop also performed, pouring on the Holy Oil, in form of a <HI>Cross,</HI> and using the same Words, <HI>viz.</HI><Q>In the Name of the FATHER, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>After this the Archbishop said this <HI>Prayer.</HI><Q>Almighty and everlasting GOD, we beseech Thee of thy abundant Good∣ness, pour out the Spirit of thy Grace and Blessing upon this thy Servant QUEEN MARY; that as by the Imposition of our Hands, she is this Day crowned QUEEN, so she may, by thy Sanctification, continue always thy chosen Servant, through CHRIST our LORD.</Q></P>
<P>Then the said great Lady, with her Assistants, having first dried the Place anointed, with fine Cotton Wool, closed the QUEEN'S Robes at the Breast, and after put a Linen Coif, upon her Head, because of the Anointing.</P>
<P>Which done, the Archbishop put the RING<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Her Majesty's Ring for this Occasion was of Gold, with a large Table Ruby set therein, and sixteen small Rubies set round the Hoop, those next the Collet were the largest, the rest di∣minishing proportionably.</NOTE>, which he re∣ceived from the Master of the <HI>Jewel House,</HI> on the fourth Finger of the <HI>Queen's</HI> Right Hand, saying,<Q>Receive this Ring, the <HI>Seal</HI> of a <HI>sincere Faith,</HI> that you may avoid all

infection of Heresy, and by the Power of GOD, compel barbarous Nations, and bring them to the Knowledge of the Truth.</Q></P>
<P>Then the Archbishop took the CROWN<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The Crown made use of at this Solemnity was of Gold, set with Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, and Pearls of great Value. It was composed of Crosses and Fleurs de Lis, with Arches, and a Mound and Cross on the Top, after the Manner of the Imperial Crown wore by the King. The Cap was of Purple Velvet, lined with white Taffetee, and turned up with Er∣mine.</NOTE> in his Hands, from off the Altar, and reverently set it upon the <HI>Queen's</HI> Head, saying,<Q>Receive the Crown of Glory, Honour, and Joy; and GOD the <HI>Crown</HI> of the <HI>Faithful,</HI> who by our <HI>Episcopal</HI> Hands, though most unworthy, hath this Day set a <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>pure Gold</HI> upon thy Head; Enrich you with Wisdom and Virtue, that after this Life, you may meet the everlasting <HI>Bridegroom</HI> our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who with the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST, liveth and reigneth for ever and ever. AMEN.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI> being <HI>crowned,</HI> all the <HI>Peeresses,</HI> immediately put on their <HI>Coronets.</HI></P>
<P>This done, the Archbishop put the SCEPTRE<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The Sceptre is of Gold, adorned with Diamonds and other precious Stones, in length two Feet ten Inches, with a Mound and Cross at the Top, issuing out of a Fleur de Lis.</NOTE> with the <HI>Cross,</HI> into her Majesty's Right Hand; and the IVORY ROD<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">This Ivory Rod or Sceptre, is in length three Feet one Inch and half; the Pomel is Gold, as is also the Mound and Cross, the Dove at the Top of the Cross is enamelled white; the Circumference at Bottom is about two Inches, and the other End about an Inch and half.</NOTE> with the <HI>Dove,</HI> into her Left Hand; and said the following Prayer.<Q>O LORD the Fountain of all good Things, and the Giver of all Perfec∣tion, grant unto this thy Servant, MARY our QUEEN, that she may or∣der aright, the high Dignity she hath obtained, and with good Works, establish the Glory thou hast given her, through CHRIST our LORD. AMEN.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Queen,</HI> being thus <HI>Anointed</HI> and <HI>Crowned,</HI> and having received all the <HI>Royal Ornaments,</HI> the <HI>Choirs</HI> sang the following ANTHEM, per∣formed by the whole Concert of Voices and Instruments.<Q><P><HI>Psalm xlv. ver. 1.</HI> My Heart is inditing of a good Matter, I speak of the Things, which I have made unto the KING. <HI>Ver. 10.</HI> At his Right Hand, shall stand the QUEEN. <HI>Ver. 14.</HI> All glorious within, Her Clothing is of wrought Gold. <HI>Ver. 15.</HI> She shall be brought unto the KING, in <HI>Raiment</HI> of <HI>Needlework.</HI> The <HI>Virgins,</HI> that follow Her, shall bear her Company. <HI>Ver. 16.</HI> With Joy and Gladness, shall they be brought, and shall enter into the <HI>King's Palace.</HI></P><P><HI>Ver. 11.</HI> Hearken, O <HI>Daughter!</HI> and consider, incline thine Ear, for∣get also thine <HI>own People,</HI> and thy <HI>Father's House.

<P>As soon as this <HI>Anthem</HI> began, the <HI>Queen</HI> arose from her <HI>Faldstool,</HI> and being supported by the two Bishops, and her Train borne and at∣tended as before, went up to the <HI>Theatre,</HI> and as she approached to∣wards the <HI>King,</HI> bowed herself reverently to his Majesty, sitting upon his <HI>Throne,</HI> on the Left Hand of the <HI>King,</HI> where she reposed herself 'till the <HI>Anthem</HI> was ended.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Anthem,</HI> there being no Communion, the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> descended, and kneeled at their <HI>Faldstools,</HI> upon the <HI>Theatre,</HI> at the Foot of their <HI>Thrones,</HI> whilst the Archbishop said the final Prayers.<Q><P>Assist us mercifully, O LORD, in these our Supplications and Prayers, and dispose the Way of thy Servants, towards the Attainment of everlasting Salvation, that among all the Changes and Chances of this mortal Life, they may ever be defended by thy most gracious and ready Help, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD. AMEN.</P>
<P>O LORD our GOD! who upholdest and governest all Things in Heaven and in Earth, receive our humble Prayers, with our Thanksgivings, for our Sovereign Lord JAMES, set over us by thy Grace and Providence to be our KING, and so together with Him, bless his Royal Consort, our gra∣cious Queen MARY, KATHERINE the Queen <HI>Dowager;</HI> their Royal Highnesses, MARY, the Princess of ORANGE, and the Princess ANNE of DENMARK, and the whole Royal Family.

<P>And grant, O LORD, we beseech Thee, That the Course of this World, may be so ordered, by thy gracious Providence, that thy Servants putting their Trust in Thee, may in all their Actions, evermore glorify thy Holy Name, and by thy Mercy obtain everlasting Life, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD. AMEN.</P></Q></P>
<P>After which, the Archbishop pronounced the BENEDICTION, <HI>viz.</HI><Q>The Peace of GOD, which passeth all Understanding, keep your Hearts and Minds, in the Knowledge and Love of GOD, and of his Son JESUS CHRIST our LORD; and the Blessing of GOD ALMIGHTY, the FA∣THER, the SON, and the HOLY GHOST, be amongst you, and remain with you always.

None of these however could be found, ex∣cept the Coronation of King James the First, which, with much Difficulty, he got to be compared by the Lords, when both Oaths appeared to be exactly the same.

Then one of the Bishops read this Passage to the King.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> we beseech you to <HI>pardon,</HI> and to grant and to preserve unto us, and to the <HI>Churches</HI> committed to your Charge, all Cano∣nical Privileges, and due Law and Justice, and that you would <HI>protect</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> us, as every good King, in his Kingdom, ought to be Protector and Defender of the Bishops and the <HI>Churches</HI> under their Government.</P>
<P>The KING answered,<Q>With a willing and devout Heart, I promise and grant my Pardon, and that I will preserve and maintain to you, and the <HI>Churches</HI> committed to your Charge, all Canonical Privileges and due <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> and that I will be your <HI>Protector</HI> and <HI>Defender</HI> to my Power, by the <HI>Assistance</HI> of GOD, as every good King in his Kingdom, in right ought to protect and defend, the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> under their Government.</Q></P>
<P>Then the KING arose, and was led to the Communion Table, where he took a SOLEMN OATH, in sight of all the People, to ob∣serve all the <HI>Premisses,</HI> and laying his Hand upon the BIBLE said,<Q>The things which I have here <HI>promised,</HI> I shall <HI>perform</HI> and <HI>keep.</HI> So help me GOD, and the Contents of this Book.</Q></P>
<P>After the OATH, the KING was placed in the Chair of Corona∣tion, and was <HI>anointed</HI> by the <HI>Archbishop,</HI> and the ancient Robes of King <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor,</HI> was put upon him, and the <HI>Crown</HI> of that Prince put upon his Head, and his <HI>Sword</HI> girt about him, and he <HI>offered</HI> the same, and <HI>two</HI> Swords more, together with <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Sil∣ver,</HI> at the <HI>Communion</HI> Table. He was afterwards conducted by the <HI>Nobility</HI> to the <HI>Throne,</HI> where this Passage was read to his <HI>Majesty.</HI><Q>Stand and hold fast from henceforth, the <HI>Place</HI> to which you have been <HI>Heir,</HI> by the Succession of your Forefathers, being now delivered to you, by the Authority of ALMIGHTY GOD, and by the Hands of us and all the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> of GOD, and as you see the <HI>Clergy</HI> to come nearer the <HI>Altar,</HI> than others, so remember that in all Places convenient, you give them greater Honour, that the MEDIATOR of GOD and Man, may estab∣lish you in the Kingly <HI>Throne,</HI> to be a <HI>Mediator</HI> betwixt the <HI>Clergy</HI> and the <HI>Laity,</HI> and that you may Reign for ever, with JESUS CHRIST, the KING of KINGS, and LORD of LORDS.</Q></P>

<HEAD>No. V. The LAWS relative to the CORONATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Scots,</HI> so early as the <HI>first</HI> Seffion of the <HI>first</HI> Parliament, of King <HI>James</HI> the <HI>Sixth,</HI> framed an <HI>Act</HI> for establishing an <HI>Oath</HI> to be taken by their <HI>Kings</HI> at their <HI>Coronation,</HI> for the Maintenance and Preservation of the <HI>Protestant Religion.</HI> After the Revolution, by an <HI>Act</HI> in the <HI>first</HI> Year of the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Ma∣ry,</HI> the <HI>Coronation Oath</HI> was fixed and settled as it was to be taken by their then <HI>Majesties,</HI> and their Successors. By another <HI>Act,</HI> in the <HI>Second</HI> Seffion of the same Parliament, for declaring the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI> of the <HI>Subject,</HI> and settling the <HI>Succession</HI> of the <HI>Crown,</HI> a farther Provi∣sion is made, by appointing the <HI>Declaration</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Statute</HI> of the <HI>thirtieth</HI> Year of <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> to be made and taken by the <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Queen.</HI></P>
<P>By an <HI>Act</HI> passed in the <HI>fifth</HI> Year of her late Majesty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> Provision is made for the Support and Maintenance of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and by an <HI>Act</HI> in the same Reign, passed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> previous and preparatory to the UNION, the like Care is taken for the Preserva∣tion of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion, and <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church Government in that Kingdom. By these several <HI>Laws,</HI> the Directions of which have been ever since punctually complied with, the civil and religious <HI>Rights</HI> of the <HI>Subject</HI> have been effectually settled and secured; and all Causes of Jealousy, in respect to the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Crown,</HI> have been entirely and happily <HI>removed</HI></P>
