<HEAD>THE Double Welcome. A POEM To the Duke of <HI>MARLBOROUGH.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>THE Muse that by Your Victory's Inspir'd,</L>
<L><HI>First sung those Conquests,</HI> all the World admir'd,</L>
<L>Now sings the Triumphs of your Native Land,</L>
<L>Where you <HI>our Hearts</HI> as well <HI>as Troops</HI> Command,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Her Debt of Praise is Yours, but 'tis her Due,</L>
<L><HI>That welcom'd Vict'ry,</HI> now to welcome You.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And tho' her Verse <HI>too mean</HI> to sing your Fame,</L>
<L>Injures the Hero by the Poet's Name;</L>
<L>Abject and low, and <HI>scorch'd by Party-Fire,</HI></L>
<L>Whom neither <HI>Name</HI> Invites nor <HI>Hopes</HI> Inspire:</L>
<L>Yet this she claims, she can Your Fame rehearse,</L>
<L><HI>Ʋnbiass'd</HI> in Your Praise, <HI>Impartial</HI> in her Verse.</L>
<L>This Character sh' has kept, and this she brings,</L>
<L>She always scorn'd to flatter, <HI>tho' she sung to Kings.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Satyr has been her Talent,</HI> Truth her Song,</L>
<L>Truth <HI>who can bear it!</HI> sung too loud, too long.</L>
<L><HI>Bright Truth!</HI> that Stranger to the Jingling Train,</L>
<L>Makes all their Praises Satyrs, all their Satyrs vain,</L>
<L>While Truth can neither this nor that explain.</L>
<L>Th' <HI>Ʋnspotted Standard</HI> has been all her Aim,</L>
<L>For this <HI>she has felt her Fate,</HI> and sunk her Fame:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
For this <HI>they've</HI> damn'd the Poet and his Rimes,</L>
<L>And slain th' unhappy Muse <HI>for want of Crimes</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Adapted thus to Sacred <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Fame,</HI></L>
<L>She never sung but they were both her Theam</L>
<L>Stranger to Panegyrick and to Praise,</L>
<L>It must be <HI>some sublime</HI> must her just Fancy raise.</L>
<L>To <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Merit</HI> she was always true,</L>
<L>She never could the flattering Flight pursue,</L>
<L>And never prais'd but <HI>William,</HI> Sir, and <HI>You.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And should she, spight of Nature, strain her Thought,</L>
<L>Should she his Lawrels sing that never fought,</L>
<L>Should she make <HI>Gallo</HI> Chast and <HI>Talus</HI> Wise,</L>
<L>And praise Immortal Blockheads in Disguise,</L>
<L>Or feign a Hero,</L>
<L>'Twould be so forc'd, so aukward, and so dull,</L>
<L><HI>Gallo</HI> would seem <HI>more Lewd, Talus</HI> seem <HI>more a Fool:</HI></L>
<L>Truth thro' the Lawn of Flattery would shine,</L>
<L>And in Mock-Praise the Satyr must be seen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<L>Should we Eternal Trophies seem to raise,</L>
<L>And Flying <HI>Chamo</HI>'s Doubtful Vict'ry praise.</L>
<L>Disputed Honours partially decide,</L>
<L>And grant that Fame <HI>Bellona</HI> had deny'd;</L>
<L>To Vict'ry's Statue new Mock Honours pay,</L>
<L>And say they Conqu'red there that run away;</L>
<L>'Twould with such Incoherent Nonsence shine,</L>
<L>The blushing Hero must the aukward Praise decline:</L>
<L>The <HI>strong Collateral Banter</HI> would appear,</L>
<L>Courage so sung would read <HI>like Hymns to Fear.</HI></L>
<L>The Painters thus by Contraries present</L>
<L>The allegorick <HI>Devil</HI> like the <HI>Saint,</HI></L>
<L>But by some faint Reflection show their Care</L>
<L><HI>The Cloven Meaning</HI> should not fail t'appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>The Poet,</HI> Sir, to Plainness thus ennur'd,</L>
<L>Thus from the Charge of Flatt'ry first secur'd,</L>
<L>An Honest and Unbyass'd Freedom brings,</L>
<L>And <HI>all the Nation listens</HI> while he sings;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
In his Inviting Consort freely Joyn,</L>
<L>Just so they did when first he sung <HI>the Boyne;</HI></L>
<L>Just as when <HI>Namur</HI>'s Conquer'd Walls he sung,</L>
<L><HI>Britannia</HI> own'd his Harp Divinely strung.</L>
<L><HI>'Tis Subject makes a</HI> Poet, and the Verse</L>
<L>Must be Inspir'd when <HI>William</HI> we rehearse;</L>
<L>His mighty Name Poetick Force procures,</L>
<L>And next to him the Inspiration's <HI>Yours.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From Foreign Fields and <HI>wild Danubian</HI> Shore,</L>
<L>Where <HI>English</HI> Armies never trod before,</L>
<L><HI>Fruitful of Dangers,</HI> long ennur'd to War</L>
<L>For <HI>Great Gustavus</HI> us'd to Conquer There;</L>
<L><HI>Herculean Labours past,</HI> and Hazards run,</L>
<L>Unheard of <HI>Marches</HI> made, unlook'd for <HI>Vict'rys</HI> won:</L>
<L>From Battels <HI>fought in Earnest,</HI> and the Field</L>
<L>Which none but <HI>these</HI> could win, where <HI>those</HI> must yield:)</L>
<L>From unexampl'd Conduct and Success,</L>
<L><HI>That</HI> ne'er had been so great had <HI>This</HI> been less</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
From Deeds too mighty to be spoke by Words,</L>
<L>Printed in Death, engrav'd <HI>with English Swords,</HI></L>
<L>Confest by <HI>Humbl'd France,</HI> and loudly told</L>
<L>By Valour <HI>dearly bought,</HI> by Valour <HI>dearly sold:</HI></L>
<L>From scatter'd Enemies and rescued Crowns,</L>
<L>Which Envy nor <HI>Disputes</HI> nor Pride <HI>disowns;</HI></L>
<L><HI>You're welcome, Sir,</HI> to this unthankful Shore,</L>
<L>Where Men of Worth were <HI>never own'd</HI> before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If in the future Glories you pursue,</L>
<L>You find the hateful Scandal happen true;</L>
<L>The Names of <HI>Schellenberg</HI> and <HI>Hockstet</HI> lie</L>
<L>Buried with <HI>Namure</HI> and the <HI>Boyn</HI> in wild Obscurity.</L>
<L>Let not your Virtue in Suspence appear,</L>
<L>'T has always been the Fate of Merit here:</L>
<L>A steady Glory ever has entail'd</L>
<L>The Grin of Envy; Envy never fail'd</L>
<L>To act the high refin'd Extreme of Hell</L>
<L>How <HI>William</HI> found it, <HI>Blush my Muse to tell.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<L>Shall any Foreign Bard desire to know</L>
<L>Why <HI>Britain</HI> can so few like <HI>William</HI> show?</L>
<L>Say angry Poet, tell 'em 'tis because</L>
<L>Ingrateful Devils grudge them due Applause.</L>
<L>The Nation's Genius acted from below</L>
<L>Rewards no Service, will no Merit know.</L>
<L>Fame's empty Record none but <HI>Marlbro'</HI> shows,</L>
<L>Would <HI>England</HI>'s Work on <HI>England</HI>'s Terms espouse:</L>
<L>But he like <HI>Wiliam, Heavens their Fame regard,</HI></L>
<L>Pursues true Virtue for its own Reward.</L>
<L><HI>Welcome Immortal Hero's</HI> to that Shore,</L>
<L>Where Men of <HI>Equal Worth</HI> were never seen before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From <HI>Fam'd Breda</HI> set out the mighty Train,</L>
<L><HI>William</HI> too oft <HI>set out from thence</HI> in vain.</L>
<L>Advance my Muse, and view th' embattel'd Line,</L>
<L>They pass the <HI>Maese,</HI> the <HI>Moselle,</HI> and the <HI>Rhine.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<HI>France</HI> in Suspence the mighy Storm foresaw,</L>
<L>The Conq'ring Squrdrons for the Battel draw,</L>
<L>And <HI>Mars</HI> stood blindly hov'ring o'er <HI>Landau.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Laugh at the guilty baffled God of War,</L>
<L>Ye Sons of Arms, the Scene's prepar'd afar;</L>
<L>Not <HI>Lewis</HI> now, not <HI>Mars</HI> himself could know</L>
<L>Where <HI>English Jove</HI> his Thunderbolt would throw:</L>
<L>No Traytors brib'd by <HI>France</HI> could lead the way,</L>
<L>Not Hell it self the Project could betray,</L>
<L>Nor sell the Nation, as in <HI>William</HI>'s time, for Pay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Troops amus'd with Halts and Feints of War</L>
<L>The just Surprize instructs them what to fear;</L>
<L>When you to <HI>Danube</HI>'s Banks in hast advance,</L>
<L>A Length unlook'd for, unforeseen by <HI>France.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Swift, as the <HI>German</HI> Eagles lead, you fly</L>
<L>On Gusts of Hope, and Wings of Victory;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Your Passes o'er the <HI>Swabian</HI> Rocks appear</L>
<L>Like <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s, with Flame and Vinegar:</L>
<L>And when the distant Vales their Prospect show,</L>
<L>You threaten Conquest to the Plains below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Before your powerful Troops <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s fly,</L>
<L>And <HI>Schellenberg</HI> give way to Victory.</L>
<L>The fam'd Ascent had thirteen times and more</L>
<L>Been storm'd, and ne'er was won but once before.</L>
<L>Once did the great <HI>Gustave Bavaria</HI> here pursue,</L>
<L>He Conquer'd here because he fought like You.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From thence thro' ravag'd Towns and conquer'd Plains</L>
<L>The Monument of Victory remains,</L>
<L><HI>Augsburg</HI> and <HI>Munick</HI> trembl'd at your Name,</L>
<L>Tho' not inform'd of your approaching Fame:</L>
<L>To <HI>Blenheim, happy Name!</HI> the Scenes advance,</L>
<L>There gathers all the Thunderbolts of <HI>France.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
A Leash of Armies on thy Plains appear</L>
<L>Each fancied able to support a War,</L>
<L>And free a Nation from the Vanity of Fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We that at Distance saw th' approaching Day,</L>
<L>Knew the Design, and saw the Bloody Way.</L>
<L>Blame not, great Prince, the doubts we own were true;</L>
<L>Our anxious Thoughts for <HI>England</HI> and for You.</L>
<L>We knew your brave resolv'd and steady Mind,</L>
<L>But who durst hope for what remain'd behind;</L>
<L>Who durst foretell the Glories of the Day,</L>
<L>That saw the dreadful Dangers of the Way:</L>
<L>Not Heaven it self, had we the News receiv'd</L>
<L>From Heaven it self, would here ha' been believ'd.</L>
<L>When first the Tidings thro' the Nation flew,</L>
<L>We pauz'd to ask if 'twas a Dream or true;</L>
<L>Amaz'd almost as much as they that fled,</L>
<L>While those with Fear, and these with Joy, dismay'd.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Speak all ye Sons of <HI>Rhime,</HI> the Day rehearse,</L>
<L>The Theme's too high for my too humble Verse:</L>
<L><HI>Apollo</HI> must your Heads at once inspire,</L>
<L>For needful Praise with Emblematick Fire.</L>
<L>He that in suited Verse to <HI>Marlbro'</HI> writes,</L>
<L>Should feel that very Spirit by which he fights.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still the meanest Poet of the Train</L>
<L>Keeps on, nor shall his Tribute come in vain:</L>
<L>Not all are <HI>Virgils</HI> to <HI>Mecaenas</HI> come,</L>
<L>Yet all huzza'd <HI>Augustus</HI> back to <HI>Rome;</HI></L>
<L>When from the lesser Honour of the Day</L>
<L>He brought the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Lover's Crown away</L>
<L>And thus while <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Glory you pursue,</L>
<L>The Nation's Praises are your Native Due:</L>
<L>The universal Suffrage spreads your Name,</L>
<L>And all Men bless the Poet in your Fame.</L>

<L>Poet, a large Parenthesis allow,</L>
<L>Say here he <HI>Conquer'd</HI>—leave the mighty How:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
The vast Particulars let those explain,</L>
<L>That sing in Numbers suited to the Man:</L>
<L>Let <HI>Addison</HI> our Modern <HI>Virgil</HI> sing,</L>
<L>For he's a Poet fitted for a King;</L>
<L>No Hero will his mighty Flight disdain,</L>
<L><HI>The First,</HI> as thou <HI>the Last</HI> of the Inspir'd Train;</L>
<L><HI>Maecenas</HI> has his Modern Fancy strung,</L>
<L>And fix'd his Pension first, or he had never sung;</L>
<L>Thou unregarded pay'st thy Debt to Fame,</L>
<L>Oppress'd by Fate, and too obscure to Name.</L>
<L>Envy and Party-Spleen h' has never known,</L>
<L>No humbling Jayls has pull'd his Fancy down:</L>
<L>The Towring Youth with high Success aspires,</L>
<L>And fings as one whose Song the World admires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet say he Conquer'd, tho' the mighty How</L>
<L>For <HI>Addison</HI> thou may'st in large Parenthesis allow;</L>
<L>Trace him from <HI>Bleinheim</HI> and <HI>Danubian</HI> Plains,</L>
<L>The <HI>Gallick</HI> Captiv'd Heoes in his Chains:</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Trace him to <HI>Philipsburgh</HI> and to <HI>Landau,</HI></L>
<L>And tell the <HI>French</HI> 'tis true as they foresaw;</L>
<L>He would the mighty Bastions there pull down,</L>
<L><HI>Tho' not before</HI> their Army's overthrown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Attend the Hero to the ancient <HI>Saar,</HI></L>
<L>And see him threaten <HI>Native France</HI> with War;</L>
<L>Surrender <HI>Treves</HI> that fatal Town to <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>Their Troops abandon it as his Advance;</L>
<L>Remind them of old <HI>Holstein</HI> and <HI>Crequi,</HI></L>
<L>There <HI>France, as now at Bleinheim,</HI> learn'd to fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell us no more of Conquest, <HI>Fame</HI>'s <HI>oppress'd,</HI></L>
<L>The Breathless Muses claim some time to rest;</L>
<L><HI>Saarbruck</HI> and <HI>Traarback</HI> will but spoil our Verse,</L>
<L>So harsh no Numbers can their Sounds rehearse:</L>
<L>So <HI>Nimeghen</HI> distracted soft <HI>Boileau,</HI></L>
<L>The Subject lofty, and the Poet low,</L>
<L>Made his just Numbers halt, his Verses lame,</L>
<L>For want of Rhimes to the Exotic Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
<L>Thus from a vast Variety of Scene,</L>
<L>And six huge Conquests fix'd in one Campaign,</L>
<L><HI>Bavaria Conquer'd,</HI> Settl'd, and Subdu'd,</L>
<L>The flying Prince four Hundred Mile pursu'd:</L>
<L>From <HI>Nineteen Towns surrendred,</HI> and the Field</L>
<L>With slaughter'd Heaps and vanquish'd Legions fill'd</L>
<L>From Captive Princes in your Train brought Home,</L>
<L>So <HI>Casar</HI> led the Kings of <HI>Gaul</HI> to <HI>Rome;</HI></L>
<L>From Trophies nobly bought, and fetch'd from far,</L>
<L>From boldly finishing the Jest of War,</L>
<L><HI>Your're welcome, Sir,</HI> behold th' approaching Throng</L>
<L>Of Three great Nations list'ning to my Song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How has this wise pretending Age till now</L>
<L>Talkt big of Fighting, never yet knew how;</L>
<L>Our Soldiers tyr'd with strange Fateaguing Die,</L>
<L>And in the <HI>Ditch,</HI> not <HI>Bed</HI> of Honour Lie;</L>
<L>Starv'd with the Cold and Terror of the Night,</L>
<L>But never show'd the <HI>how</HI> or <HI>where</HI> to fight.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
The weary Land the <HI>Trade of War</HI> resents,</L>
<L>For what the End designs the Means prevents.</L>
<L>The Miseries we to this Day endure</L>
<L>They caus'd that always <HI>have been paid to cure;</HI></L>
<L>Plunder's their Battles, and the Pay's their End,</L>
<L>They shun their Enemy and rob their Friend:</L>
<L>Peace would such Soldiers Livelihood destroy,</L>
<L>And so indeed they'd for their Country die.</L>
<L>For <HI>Fighting</HI>'s just the way to be undone,</L>
<L><HI>And Conquest</HI> would conclude a War too soon.</L>
<L>Good Husbandry, as <HI>Wo—ly told us how,</HI></L>
<L>Had made the <HI>Irish</HI> War ha' held till now;</L>
<L>But <HI>Fighting Ginkle</HI> struck the Stroke too soon,</L>
<L>And so the Nation's sav'd, and all the R—s undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But you instructed for your Country's Good,</L>
<L>The Cheats of War have all at once snbdued:</L>
<L>And they that thought the Field was but a Play,</L>
<L>Where all might cheat the Nation for their Pay;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
With Lace and Feathers blustering a Campaign</L>
<L>To all the Nation but themselves in vain;</L>
<L>Grow rich upon the Plunder of our Lands,</L>
<L>And raise great Fortunes out of low Commands;</L>
<L>These found the Banter on themselves made good,</L>
<L>While you the proper End of War pursu'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Campaign <HI>Beaus</HI> no more shall mock the Field</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The very Words a different Accent bear,</L>
<L><HI>Fighting</HI> must now be understood <HI>by War;</HI></L>
<L>Battel and Death's synonimous in Name,</L>
<L>And Wounds and Blood will only purchase Fame;</L>
<L>Cowards must lay their bought Commissions down,</L>
<L>Their Camps the Pit, and their Campaign the Town;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
There they may bully, swagger, and repeat</L>
<L>The mighty no Engagements they were at,</L>
<L>And fight the <HI>French</HI> in Tea and Chocolate.</L>

<LG>
<L>But he that follows <HI>Marlbro'</HI> to the Field,</L>
<L>Must all his Fame on dangerous Merit build,</L>
<L>Must look for Blows, and fairly state his Case</L>
<L>Shame at his Back, and Death before his Face;</L>
<L>A General that can show him how to die,</L>
<L>And push him on to Conquer Victory.</L>
<L>Shame, <HI>Fear's Twin-Sister,</HI> makes a Coward brave,</L>
<L>He fights to lose the Life he dares not save;</L>
<L>Fear makes him bold because he dares not fly,</L>
<L>It wants more Heart to run away than die,</L>
