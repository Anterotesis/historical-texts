<HEAD>TO JAMES CRAGGS, Jun. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Cofferer to His Royal Highness the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and Member of the Honourable House of Commons.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Do me the Honour to afford your Protection to these two <HI>Petites</HI> Pieces; I am sure none ever stood in more need of so gene∣rous a Friend and a Defender
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
as you are; tho' I dare not say they deserve this Benefit by any real Merit of their own, yet they have one Title to the Protecti∣on of all well natur'd People, which is, that they have Ene∣mies undeserv'd, and were per∣secuted by those that did not know 'em.</P>
<P>If they had gone thro' a le∣gal Course of Theatrical Justice, tho' it might have been partial, yet I should have submitted to it, as others had done before me; but to be prejudg'd and condemn'd unheard, was har∣der Measure than any body else meets with at this time a Day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Election,</HI> which had the
<PB REF="4"/>
Honour to pass your Approba∣tion, was objected against as a Party - Matter: I fancy both Sides will agree that there are unreasonable Heats and Extra∣vagancies belonging to each of 'em, which deserve to be ex∣pos'd, laugh'd at, and exploded by all true Lovers of their Country, since by such Arts, our Enemies find the way to poison our Constitution.</P>
<P>For the other, it was said there would be Offence taken at the exposing a <HI>Popish Priest.</HI> Good God! To what sort of People are we chang'd! Are those worthy Gentlemen (the Emissaries of our most avow'd and irreconcileable Enemy) to
<PB REF="5" MS="y"/>
be treated with so much Ten∣derncss.? Is not their very Pro∣fession Treason in any Subject of <HI>Great Britain?</HI> Have our Neighbours in <HI>France</HI> treated the Clergy of the Reform'd Re∣ligion with the same Regard? But let that pass, since they have their Friends and Adve∣cates even here, I hope I have some too; it is not an unpar∣donable Sin with every Body to wish well to the Liberties and Religion of one's Coun∣try: No, Sir, I assure my self, you have Goodness enough to overlook a great many o∣ther Faults, where you find an honest and disinterested Zeal for our present happy Consti∣tution.
<PB REF="6"/>
YOU, whose good Judgment ever engaged you on the right Side, the Protestant Succession, and the Interest of <HI>Britain;</HI> YOU who scorn'd to herd with the Betrayers of your Country, or raise your Fortunes on the Ruins of your Fellow Subjects; YOU who so generously espous'd my Interest, when you knew my Intention of dedicating to His Royal Highness, then Duke of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> will have the Goodness to protect a Woman who has no other Merit but her good Inclinations, and per∣petual Wishes for the Prospe∣rity of the present Govern∣ment. These were Principles,
<PB REF="7" MS="y"/>
which, you know, she was not asham'd of owning, even when it was almost Criminal to pay any Marks of Respect to that Royal Family, under which our Laws and our Liberties are now so happily secur'd.</P>
<P>I wish, Sir, that you may find any thing in either of these little Comedies, that may en∣tertain you at some leisure Hour. I know very well, that your Time is at present, too precious to be thrown away upon Trifles; that House of Commons of which you are so worthy, and so ornamental a Member, have the noblest and greatest Task now lying before them, the Vindication of our
<PB REF="8"/>
Publick Honour to all <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Extricating us out of such Difficulties, as only one Sett of Men in the World could plunge us into; but they will meet their Reward; and You, with those worthy Patri∣ots engag'd with You, will find yours in the Thanks of the present Age, and the Blessings of that of Posterity.</P>
<P>I might here expatiate on the many excellent Qualifica∣tions You are Master of, did I not know it would be harder to obtain your Pardon for touch∣ing upon that Subject, than for presuming to shrowd these lit∣tle Pieces under the Protection of your Name; besides, I think
<PB REF="9"/>
it needless at high Noon, to tell the World that it is light, since all that have Eyes, must see the Day; and all that have the Ho∣nour to know Mr. <HI>Craggs,</HI> knows his Character is above my Reach, consequently, would suffer from the Attempt of any Pen so weak as mine: There∣fore shall only beg Leave to subscribe with the profoundest Respect, <HI>Sir,</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I writ this little <HI>Farce,</HI> I was not without Hopes of having it repre∣sented on the Stage; what I propos'd to my self, was, the Honour to show their Royal Highnesses the Manner of our Elections, and enter∣tain the Town with a Subject entirely new: It has had the good Fortune to please several Persons of Distinction, and Taste, in the Reading, and some of our best Judges assur'd me, it cou'd not fail to entertain from the Stage; but the Subject being upon Elections, the Master of the Revels did not care to meddle with it, and the Players act nothing without his Licence, so that I
<PB REF="11" MS="y"/>
had given over all Thoughts of its ap∣pearing in Publick. But the Word <HI>Election,</HI> it seems, immediately fur∣nish'd out a Thousand scandalous Sto∣ries, and I was become the Subject of every Coffee-House in Town; and not∣withstanding my Friends endeavour'd to do me Justice as often as they heard me aspers'd, yet for my clearer Justi∣fication, they were of Opinion I ought to print it, since several Persons had been so industriously malicious as to re∣port that this <HI>Farce</HI> was a most impu∣dent notorious Libel upon her Late Majesty; than which there is nothing more false, and the World will see how little Ground there is for such a Re∣port; its so far from being a Satyr upon her, that there is not one personal Re∣flection design'd thro' the whole Piece; I was oblig'd indeed to make an Oppo∣sition of Parties, to heighten the Hu∣mour; it had been impossible to have writ any Thing upon the Subject with∣out it; but I dare be positive, that the
<PB REF="12"/>
Persons among whom the Scenes lie wou'd have given more Diversion than Offence to the Spectators of either Party. I endeavour'd to make every Thing appear as natural as I cou'd, and for that Reason only, I stuck Wool in the Hats of my <HI>Whigs,</HI> and Law∣rel in those of the <HI>Tories;</HI> tho' I wou'd be glad to know why the latter made use of the Lawrel to dislinguish them∣selves, when they were labouring to give up all the Conquests we had won: I should have thought a Sprig of Rose∣mary had been the properer Emblem of the then approaching Funeral of our Church and State, since the <HI>Cheva∣lier's</HI> Friends were endeavouring to bury our Religion, and Liberty, under Tyranny and Popish Superstition. Had Parliaments been Part of the Legisla∣ture among the Ancients, and our Manner of Elections known to, and practis'd by them, <HI>Apollo</HI> wou'd cer∣tainly have shown Vengance on the un∣worthy Wearers of his favourite Tree:
<PB REF="13" MS="y"/>
The Lawrel was ever held the Em∣blem of Joy, and Reward of Vertue: Hence it was worn by Victors in the <HI>Olympick Games;</HI> but have <HI>English∣men</HI> Reason to rejoyce in those Mea∣sures, that pav'd the Way for a <HI>French</HI> Government, and a <HI>Popish</HI> King?</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers, who follow∣ed their Triumphs, were crown'd with Lawrel, to denote an Expiation of the Blood which they had shed in the Wars; but our Lawrel-wearers can draw no Parellel from thence, except deserting our Allies, selling our Trade, disgracing our Generals, giving up those glorious Conquests they had won, deserv'd to be crown'd with Lawrel, or that they wou'd be thought to wear it as an Expiation of the Blood of the <HI>Catalans,</HI> and of the Twelve Thousand cut to Pieces at <HI>Denain,</HI> by the fatal Cessation of Arms.</P>
<P>Whatever Reason they had for wear∣ing
<PB REF="14"/>
it, I am glad they had not an Op∣portunity of making use of it, in the Triumph they design'd over the Laws and Liberties of their Country.</P>
<P>Here I can't omit taking notice how much the Popish Faction encreased un∣der the traiterous Management of the late Ministry, and we see by their dai∣ly Insults, that 'tis at the hazard of Life or Interest, at least, that we dare vindicate our Religion, and Liberty. Had the Author of Lady <HI>Jane Grey</HI> made her a Papist, and <HI>Gardiner</HI> a Bi∣shop of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Play been represented on the <HI>French</HI> Stage, what Protestant would have dar'd to call it a <HI>Popish Play,</HI> without run∣ning the Danger of the Gallies? If the Title of a certain Monarch, who was al∣so set up by the People, in Opposition to the Right Line, were to be represented on the Theatre of <HI>France,</HI> not even the first Peer of that Nation durst to have vented one Murmur, much less his, with∣out he were furnish'd with Philosophy
<PB REF="15" MS="y"/>
enough to endure the <HI>Bastile,</HI> and yet the Papists and their Abettors dare to do it here. It is with the utmost Indignation, that I see those wholsome Laws neglected, which ought to be put in Execution against such profess'd Enemies of our Church and State; for to the Indolence of our Peo∣ple in Power, are all our present Divisions and Distractions owing; tho' for the Author of that excellently writ Poem a∣bove-mention'd, I dare answer for him, is under no Concern for any Thing that Faction can either say or write, since 'tis very evident their Malice is not levell'd against him but against our Religion and Liberties, which he has in that Piece vindicated so well, and set the Cru∣elties of <HI>Rome</HI> in so true a Light, that a great Part of our Clergy may blush to see the Stage become a better Advocate for <HI>Protestantism</HI> than the Pulpit; and as oft as that Tragedy shall be represented the Author's Memory shall be honoured to Posterity, whilst those Pretenders to the Church, the <HI>High-Flying</HI> and <HI>Nonju∣ring-Party</HI>
<PB REF="16"/>
shall be remembred. with the utmost Detestation.</P>

<P>No, Sir, I have four Sons and three Daughters in all, fine young Men and Women as any in the Parish, no dispraise to the best. My eldest Son is a Lawyer, just out of his time, a smart young Fellow, I promise you, Sir. My second I brought up to my own Trade, and he is a very great Master of his Business, tho' I say't, as any is in all <HI>Gotham.</HI> My third Son is a Bookseller, a notable Fellow, he lives in <HI>London;</HI> he is a kind of a Wit; too, they say, and makes Verses; then he has an admirable Knack at quacking Titles. Per∣haps you may know what that is, Sir, but for my part, I do not, I confess, understand it; but they tell me, when he gets an old good for nothing Book, he claps a new Title to it, and sells off the whole Impression in a Week.</P>

<P>Why you must know, Sir, he is a main weakly Boy, he had the Rickets till he was seven Years old, which took away his Strength, and hugely dull'd his Memory; so that he's dull, very dull, Sir; I can't think what to breed him to, that don't require much Strength of Body, nor Application of

<P>Ay, ay, Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> we Fathers know what's good for our Children, better than they do themselves; they have nought to do but to submit to our Pleasures; Passive Obe∣dience is as absolutely necessary in our Wives and Children, as in Subjects to the Monarch; is not your Opinion the same, Sir <HI>Roger</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, whilst Husbands, Fathers and Monarchs exact nothing from us, contrary to our Religion and Laws: But pray, Mr. <HI>Al∣derman,</HI> How came you so passive? I remem∣ber you wore other Principles in Eighty Eight;—this is not natural, <HI>Alderman.</HI></P>

<P>Eighty Eight! that's a long time ago; I know some Men that have worn out twenty Setts of Principles since Eighty Eight, both Men of the Robe, and Men of the Gown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Rog.</SPEAKER>
<P>More the pity, <HI>Alderman,</HI> I am sor∣ry Nature did not distinguish Men of such Principles from the rest of her Handywork,
<PB N="57" REF="50"/>
that we might enjoy her Gifts more amply, and be more thankful for the Blessings. When I reflect that I am of the same Species with the Betrayers of my Country (for sure that Crime is the greatest of all others) I could almost wish to wear any other Form of the Creation. Life is a Blessing, or a Curse, according to the Fame we purchase, and he that redeems twenty of his Fellow Creatures from the slavish Yoke of Tyranny, does an Action worthy of a Man that bears the Image of his Creator, whilst he who seeks by Treachery to inslave his Kind, to feed Ambi∣tion, Avarice, or Revenge, is only the Pest of human Society, and ought to have a Mark set upon him, that we might shun him as we would the Plague.</P>

<P>Nay, look ye as that, his Means and his Religion is nothing to me, let his Credi∣tors take care of one, and our Parson o' th' t'other; for my part, I'm for the Church, as I said before, and would rather be a Papist than a Presbyterian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, where's the Necessity of your being either? Come, come, there's a more convincing Argument than what you have nam'd;—Mr. <HI>Tickup</HI> is recommended by some great Man on whom you have Depen∣dance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great Man! Why yes, truly, he is a pretty large Man; and I have, I trust Hea∣ven, very great Dependance on what he says: The Parson of the Parish, you know, ought to be regarded, Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> and he told me that Mr. <HI>Tickup</HI> was a good Churchman, and pray'd me to vote for him, and to get all my Friends to do the same, if I would promote the Interest of the Church.</P>
