<HEAD>AN ELEGY WRITTEN ON Saint MARK'S Eve.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FRAUGHT with malicious storm a louring cloud</L>
<L>Disrobes the firmament, that glow'd with light,</L>
<L>While from yon rain-beat porch the raven loud</L>
<L>Ushers with hideous shriek the startled night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The spider ticking from the fretted wall,</L>
<L>And humming beetle sing their drowsy knell,</L>
<L>The sightless batts a shrill assembly call,</L>
<L>And dire events in dismal sounds foretell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>To this lone waste, this dark and dreary vale,</L>
<L>Where mould'ring sleeps the once-inspired clay,</L>
<L>(If so I read aright the gossip tale,)</L>
<L>Each destin'd shade directs its gloomy way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How some the churlish and rough whirlwind ride</L>
<L>Mingling l've learnt amid the village throng,</L>
<L>Others, like sailing meteors, nimbly glide,</L>
<L>Or stalk slow-pac'd the thick-strew'd tombs among.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each, as her mind presents the varied shape,</L>
<L>With greedy horror tells her heedful friend,</L>
<L>She, o'er the blue and glim'ring lamp agape,</L>
<L>Feels every magic hair to start an end.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Warn'd by that dying flame at length to part</L>
<L>Each trembling guest slips to her several bed,</L>
<L>Whilst I, fond swain, bewail a slighted heart,</L>
<L>And breathe my sorrows to the senseless dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But thou, that haunt'st the cloister-circled tower,</L>
<L>Echo, I ween, dost hear my wailing moan,</L>
<L>For sure as comes this sad and secret hour,</L>
<L>Thy ill-tim'd sympathy returns each groan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>Thou too, pale cypress, whose forewarning leaf</L>
<L>Strews the dull mansions of th' intombed dead,</L>
<L>Say, is it then in friendship to my grief</L>
<L>Thou point'st where soon shall rest this witless head?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet for thou'rt wont my humble brow to crown,</L>
<L>And eke my pipe thy wreathed bows sustain,</L>
<L>If chance my fate should reach some shepherd clown</L>
<L>Tell, for you know, the story of my pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor may thy bark its many a wound abide,</L>
<L>The name which marreth us shall ruin thee,</L>
<L>Nor shall the wise this simple talk deride,</L>
<L>Can I find ought more stony-deaf than she?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' the proud trunk heaven's full despight doth brave,</L>
<L>Nathless it yieldeth to the subtle wind,</L>
<L>Tho' the rock frown, the patient prostrate wave</L>
<L>By long assault doth sure admittance find:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet she unmov'd my mournful sigh can hear,</L>
<L>And sterner than the knotted oak remain,</L>
<L>Yet she remorseless sees my falling tear,</L>
<L>And less than lifeless flint regards my pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>But strait the sluggish hemlock springing round</L>
<L>Wafts to my slumb'ring sense the loaded gale,</L>
<L>While night, who now bad hush each ruder sound,</L>
<L>Soft o'er my temples spreads her sable veil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The balmy influence of long-lacked sleep</L>
<L>To sweet oblivion lulls my soothed breast,</L>
<L>The winds that erst did lash that vexed deep,</L>
<L>The storm of raging troubles sinks to rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Sleep! how near to death art thou allied!</L>
<L>O Death! what art thou but a longer dream?</L>
<L>Nor wot I of the ill that can betide,</L>
<L>When thou so still and so serene dost seem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Strange sights oppress my fancy's wakeful eye,</L>
<L>A gastly troop of meager ghosts appear,</L>
<L>There one in pensive plight I do espy</L>
<L>To close with uncouth gait the creeping rear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh then! thou spirit forlorn, instruct me soon</L>
<L>Why shrinks my soul at thy partic'lar sight,</L>
<L>Say why thou visit'st thus the paly moon</L>
<L>Doubling the native horrors of the night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>Still in the most dejected front I see</L>
<L>Some struggling spark, some faint upholding ray,</L>
<L>Alas! why comes not the same hope to thee?</L>
<L>Thy mein is sadness, and thy look dismay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At this he waves his head, and strikes his breast,</L>
<L>And thrice in piteous sort he doth assay,</L>
<L>The eloquence of woe bespeaks the rest,</L>
<L>And stops the fault'ring accent on its way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length—"I warn thee, mark you cheerless train,</L>
<L>"Know, ere this eve returns, to each is given,</L>
<L>"Or to endure the fierce assault of pain,</L>
<L>"Or freely tread the star-pav'd courts of heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"See many a faded cheek and furrow'd brow,</L>
<L>"That witness dire dismay, and lost estate,</L>
<L>"What soul so confident but fears to know</L>
<L>"That righteous sentence which must seal its fate?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The mimic tyrant whose contemptuous mind</L>
<L>"Ne'er smil'd in pity on the wretch beneath,</L>
<L>"At the last hour in serious truth shall find</L>
<L>"No flattery in the chill embrace of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<L>"Awhile he stood in lawless pow'r unharm'd;</L>
<L>"What pow'r shall screen him at that vengeful time,</L>
<L>"When every eye shall wake, each hand be arm'd</L>
<L>"To shame his folly, and correct his crime?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"What tho' the pageantry of labor'd woe</L>
<L>"Should bid the marble rise to solemn pride;</L>
<L>"Such the false grandeur of its bootless shew,</L>
<L>"It gilds the glittering slave it meant to hide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The ruddy swain who leaves his quiet sleep,</L>
<L>"Chiding with early song the ling'ring dawn,</L>
<L>"Whose sober care directs the trooping sheep</L>
<L>"Or to the willowy brook, or pastur'd lawn,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"To whom, as mindful of his lowly birth,</L>
<L>"Nature an universal blank hath given,</L>
<L>"Soon when he quits this dull unfriendly earth,</L>
<L>"Shall rest approved by the voice of heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"For his poor steps would ne'er presume to tread</L>
<L>"Those much-worn paths where nobler feet had been,</L>
<L>"Dar'd not to follow where they boldly led,</L>
<L>"But left to greater souls the privilege to sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>"The charms of wit, the joys of youth shall fade,</L>
<L>"And beauty's early bloom shall wither'd be,</L>
<L>"A killing blast shall strike th' unwary maid,</L>
<L>"That heart will bleed, tho' now it tortures thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The noise of sports, the luxury of dress,</L>
<L>"All giddy gay desires shall wear away,</L>
<L>"Each splendid vanity forget to bless,</L>
<L>"And she all wan with wasting grief decay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"For neither titled fame, nor hoarded wealth,</L>
<L>"Nor beauty's early bloom hath power to save,</L>
<L>"Nor sober industry, nor ruddy health</L>
<L>"Can hold one victim from th' untimely grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"But idly sure the needful time we spend,</L>
<L>"While as more weighty words I should impart,</L>
<L>"O let thy reason's dearest thought attend,</L>
<L>"And read th' awak'ning lesson to thine heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Far be thy custom'd place where yonder steep</L>
<L>"High over-arch'd surveys the distant stream,</L>
<L>"Think what a giddy height it is to leap,</L>
<L>"Think, and beware, nor slight your warning dream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<L>"To cleave the yielding unsubstantial air,—</L>
<L>"To light transfixt upon the pointed rock,—</L>
<L>"O think!—Yet, if thy steady sense can dare</L>
<L>"To meet with welcome hail this mortal shock,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Too soon thou wilt regret thine evil plight,</L>
<L>"That spirit howe'er resolv'd must needs be griev'd,</L>
<L>"When hell's dread regions open to the sight,</L>
<L>"Regions, which eye ne'er saw, nor heart conceiv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"And well I ween the wretch, whoe'er he be,</L>
<L>"That swims that gulph shall never pass it more,</L>
<L>"It is a merciless and thwarting sea,</L>
<L>"That ne'er will waft him to the once-left shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Then rue the hapless while, thou foolish swain,</L>
<L>"When thou wast trapped by those witching eyes,</L>
<L>"It is the galled conscience gives the pain,</L>
<L>"That fell insatiate worm, that never dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"To the gross mould, from whence it did begin,</L>
<L>"After short time the kindred clay returns,</L>
<L>"While the more active light which shines within,</L>
<L>"The unexhausted lamp for ever burns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<L>"That quick'ning portion of the Spirit divine</L>
<L>"Shall surely last thro' endless time to come,</L>
<L>"Nor seek her airy motions to confine</L>
<L>"Within the shallow limits of the tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Perchance some fury, like this scornful fair,</L>
<L>"May haunt thy walks, and every step attend,</L>
<L>"Cloath'd in each frown the same she may appear,</L>
<L>"Save this a mortal, that a deathless fiend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Yet, worthless as I am, I do not mean</L>
<L>"With curious and affrontive zeal to pry,</L>
<L>"Where heaven hath drawn its curtain o'er the scene,</L>
<L>"And shut the clouded prospect from mine eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"This only and important truth I learn,</L>
<L>"When the last trump shall wake the lazy dead,</L>
<L>"No vain pretence, no trifling fond concern</L>
<L>"Shall rouse the shrouded sinner from his bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Hence then, and mingle in the mirthful train,</L>
<L>"With them resume thy long-neglected crook,</L>
<L>"Awake to sprightly stop the pipe again,</L>
<L>"Cheer thy sad heart, and smooth thy love-worn look.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<L>"If so thine hallow'd soul thou e'er didst love,</L>
<L>"As heaven in gentle mercy leans to thee,</L>
<L>"If there be damn'd below, or saints above,</L>
<L>"If thou art mock'd of her, or mourn'd of me,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"If ought can move thee—fly the wily snare</L>
<L>"That may seduce thee to this fearful end,"</L>
<L>(When strait dissolving in the viewless air)</L>
<L>"Awake!" he cries, "bestir thee, and amend!"</L>
