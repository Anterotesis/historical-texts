<HEAD>THE PLEASURES OF MELANCHOLY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MOther of Musings, <HI>Contemplation</HI> sage,</L>
<L>Whose mansion is upon the topmost cliff</L>
<L>Of cloud-capt Teneriff, in secret bow'r;</L>
<L>Where ever wrapt in meditation high,</L>
<L>Thou hear'st unmov'd, in dark tempestuous night,</L>
<L>The loud winds howl around, the beating rain</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3" MS="y"/>And the big hail in mingling storm descend</L>
<L>Upon his horrid brow. But when the skies</L>
<L>Unclouded shine, and thro' the blue serene</L>
<L>Pale Cynthia rolls her silver-axled car,</L>
<L>Then ever looking on the spangled vault</L>
<L>Raptur'd thou sit'st, while murmurs indistinct</L>
<L>Of distant billows sooth thy pensive ear</L>
<L>With hoarse and hollow sounds; secure, self-blest,</L>
<L>Oft too thou listen'st to the wild uproar</L>
<L>Of fleets encount'ring, that in whispers low</L>
<L>Ascends the rocky summit, where thou dwell'st</L>
<L>Remote from man, conversing with the spheres.</L>
<L>O lead me, black-brow'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to solemn glooms</L>
<L>Cogenial with my soul, to chearless shades,</L>
<L>To ruin'd seats, to twilight cells and bow'rs,</L>
<L>Where thoughtful <HI>Melancholy</HI> loves to muse,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>Her fav'rite midnight haunts. The laughing scenes</L>
<L>Of purple Spring, where all the wanton train</L>
<L>Of Smiles and Graces seem to lead the dance</L>
<L>In sportive round, while from their hands they show'r</L>
<L>Ambrosial blooms and flow'rs, no longer charm;</L>
<L>Tempe, no more I court thy balmy breeze,</L>
<L>Adieu green vales! embroider'd meads adieu!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath yon' ruin'd Abbey's moss-grown piles</L>
<L>Oft let me sit, at twilight hour of Eve,</L>
<L>Where thro' some western window the pale moon</L>
<L>Pours her long-levell'd rule of streaming light;</L>
<L>While sullen sacred silence reigns around,</L>
<L>Save the lone Screech-owl's note, whose bow'r is built</L>
<L>Amid the mould'ring caverns dark and damp,</L>
<L>And the calm breeze, that rustles in the leaves</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>Of flaunting Ivy, that with mantle green</L>
<L>Invests some sacred tow'r. Or let me tread</L>
<L>It's neighb'ring walk of pines, where stray'd of old</L>
<L>The cloyster'd brothers: thro' the gloomy void</L>
<L>That far extends beneath their ample arch</L>
<L>As on I tread, religious horror wraps</L>
<L>My soul in dread repose. But when the world</L>
<L>Is clad in Midnight's raven-colour'd robe,</L>
<L>In hollow charnel let me watch the flame</L>
<L>Of taper dim, while airy voices talk</L>
<L>Along the glimm'ring walls, or ghostly shape</L>
<L>At distance seen, invites with beck'ning hand</L>
<L>My lonesome steps, thro' the far-winding vaults.</L>
<L>Nor undelightful is the solemn noon</L>
<L>Of night, when haply wakeful from my couch</L>
<L>I start: lo, all is motionless around!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>Roars not the rushing wind, the sons of men</L>
<L>And every beast in mute oblivion lie;</L>
<L>All Nature's hush'd in silence and in sleep.</L>
<L>O then how fearful is it to reflect,</L>
<L>That thro' the solitude of the still globe</L>
<L>No Being wakes but me! 'till stealing sleep</L>
<L>My drooping temples baths in opiate dews.</L>
<L>Nor then let dreams, of wanton Folly born,</L>
<L>My senses lead thro' flowery paths of joy;</L>
<L>But let the sacred Genius of the night</L>
<L>Such mystic visions send, as SPENSER saw,</L>
<L>When thro' bewild'ring Fancy's magic maze,</L>
<L>To the bright regions of the fairy world</L>
<L>Soar'd his creative mind: or MILTON knew,</L>
<L>When in abstracted thought he first conceiv'd</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>All heav'n in tumult, and the Seraphim</L>
<L>Come tow'ring, arm'd in adamant and gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let others love the Summer-ev'ning's smiles,</L>
<L>As list'ning to some distant water-fall</L>
<L>They mark the blushes of the streaky west:</L>
<L>I choose the pale December's foggy glooms;</L>
<L>Then, when the sullen shades of Ev'ning close,</L>
<L>Where thro' the room a blindly-glimm'ring gleam</L>
<L>The dying embers scatter, far remote</L>
<L>From Mirth's mad shouts, that thro' the lighted roof</L>
<L>Resound with festive echo, let me sit,</L>
<L>Blest with the lowly cricket's drowsy dirge.</L>
<L>Then let my contemplative thought explore</L>
<L>This fleeting state of things, the vain delights,</L>
<L>The fruitless toils, that still elude our search,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>As thro' the wilderness of life we rove.</L>
<L>This sober hour of silence will unmask</L>
<L>False Folly's smiles, that like the dazling spells</L>
<L>Of wily Comus, cheat th' unweeting eye</L>
<L>With blear illusion, and persuade to drink</L>
<L>The charmed cup, that Reason's mintage fair</L>
<L>Unmoulds, and stamps the monster on the man.</L>
<L>Eager we taste, but in the luscious draught</L>
<L>Forget the pois'nous dregs that lurk beneath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Few know that Elegance of soul refin'd,</L>
<L>Whose soft sensation feels a quicker joy</L>
<L>From Melancholy's scenes, than the dull pride</L>
<L>Of tasteless splendor and magnificence</L>
<L>Can e'er afford. Thus Eloise, whose mind</L>
<L>Had languish'd to the pangs of melting love,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>More secret transport found, as on some tomb</L>
<L>Reclin'd she watch'd the tapers of the dead,</L>
<L>Or thro' the pillar'd isles, amid the shrines</L>
<L>Of imag'd saints, and intermingled graves,</L>
<L>Which scarce the story'd windows dim disclos'd,</L>
<L>Musing she wander'd; than Cosmelia finds,</L>
<L>As thro' the Mall in silken pomp array'd,</L>
<L>She floats amid the gilded sons of dress,</L>
<L>And shines the fairest of th' assembled Belles.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When azure noon-tide chears the daedal globe,</L>
<L>And the glad regent of the golden day</L>
<L>Rejoices in his bright meridian bow'r,</L>
<L>How oft my wishes ask the night's return,</L>
<L>That best befriends the melancholy mind!</L>
<L>Hail, sacred Night! to thee my song I raise!</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>Sister of ebon-scepter'd Hecat, hail!</L>
<L>Whether in congregated clouds thou wrap'st</L>
<L>Thy viewless chariot, or with silver crown</L>
<L>Thy beaming head encirclest, ever hail!</L>
<L>What tho' beneath thy gloom the Lapland witch</L>
<L>Oft celebrates her moon-eclipsing rites;</L>
<L>Tho' Murther wan, beneath thy shrouding shade</L>
<L>Oft calls her silent vot'ries to devise</L>
<L>Of blood and slaughter, while by one blue lamp</L>
<L>In secret conf'rence sits the list'ning band,</L>
<L>And start at each low wind, or wakeful sound:</L>
<L>What tho' thy stay the Pilgrim curses oft,</L>
<L>As all benighted in Arabian wastes</L>
<L>He hears the howling wilderness resound</L>
<L>With roaming monsters, while on his hoar head</L>
<L>The black-descending tempest ceaseless beats;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>Yet more delightful to my pensive mind</L>
<L>Is thy return, than bloomy Morn's approach,</L>
<L>When from the portals of the saffron East</L>
<L>She sheds fresh roses and ambrosial dews.</L>
<L>Yet not ungrateful is the Morn's approach,</L>
<L>When dropping wet she comes, and clad in clouds,</L>
<L>While thro' the damp air scowls the peevish South,</L>
<L>And the dusk landschape rises dim to view.</L>
<L>Th' afflicted songsters of the sadden'd groves</L>
<L>Hail not the sullen gloom, but silent droop;</L>
<L>The waving elms, that rang'd in thick array,</L>
<L>Enclose with stately row some rural hall,</L>
<L>Are mute, nor echo with the clamors hoarse</L>
<L>Of rooks rejoicing on their hoary boughs:</L>
<L>While to the shed the dripping poultry croud,</L>
<L>A mournful train: secure the village-hind</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>Hangs o'er the crackling blaze, nor tempts the storm;</L>
<L>Rings not the high wood with enliv'ning shouts</L>
<L>Of early hunter: all is silence drear;</L>
<L>And deepest sadness wraps the face of things.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' POPE's soft song tho' all the Graces breath,</L>
<L>And happiest art adorn his Attic page;</L>
<L>Yet does my mind with sweeter transport glow,</L>
<L>As at the foot of some hoar oak reclin'd,</L>
<L>In magic SPENSER's wildly-warbled song</L>
<L>I see deserted Una wander wide</L>
<L>Thro' wasteful solitudes, and lurid heaths,</L>
<L>Weary, forlorn, than when the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Belinda. Vid. <HI>Rape of the Lock.</HI></NOTE> fated Fair,</L>
<L>Upon the bosom bright of silver Thames,</L>
<L>Launches in all the lustre of Brocade,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>Amid the splendors of the laughing Sun.</L>
<L>The gay description palls upon the sense,</L>
<L>And coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O wrap me then in shades of darksom pine,</L>
<L>Bear me to caves by desolation brown,</L>
<L>To dusky vales, and hermit-haunted rocks!</L>
<L>And hark, methinks resounding from the gloom</L>
<L>The voice of Melancholy strikes mine ear;</L>
<L>"Come, leave the busy trifles of vain life,</L>
<L>"And let these twilight mansions teach thy mind</L>
<L>"The Joys of Musing, and of solemn Thought."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye youths of Albion's beauty-blooming isle,</L>
<L>Whose brows have worn the wreath of luckless love,</L>
<L>Is there a pleasure like the pensive mood,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>Whose magic wont to sooth your soften'd souls?</L>
<L>O tell how rapt'rous is the deep-felt bliss</L>
<L>To melt to Melody's assuasive voice,</L>
<L>Careless to stray the midnight mead along,</L>
<L>And pour your sorrows to the pitying moon,</L>
<L>Oft interrupted by the Bird of Woe!</L>
<L>To muse by margin of romantic stream,</L>
<L>To fly to solitudes, and there forget</L>
<L>The solemn dulness of the tedious world,</L>
<L>'Till in abstracted dreams of fancy lost,</L>
<L>Eager you snatch the visionary fair,</L>
<L>And on the phantom feast your cheated gaze!</L>
<L>Sudden you start—th' imagin'd joys recede,</L>
<L>The same sad prospect opens on your sense;</L>
<L>And nought is seen but deep-extended trees</L>
<L>In hollow rows, and your awaken'd ear</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>Again attends the neighb'ring fountain's sound.</L>
<L>These are delights that absence drear has made</L>
<L>Familiar to my soul, er'e since the form</L>
<L>Of young Sapphira, beauteous as the Spring,</L>
<L>When from her vi'let-woven couch awak'd</L>
<L>By frolic Zephyr's hand, her tender cheek</L>
<L>Graceful she lifts, and blushing from her bow'r,</L>
<L>Issues to cloath in gladsome-glist'ring green</L>
<L>The genial globe, first met my dazled sight.</L>
<L>These are delights unknown to minds profane,</L>
<L>And which alone the pensive soul can taste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The taper'd choir, at midnight hour of Pray'r,</L>
<L>Oft let me tread, while to th' according voice</L>
<L>The many-sounding organ peals on high,</L>
<L>In full-voic'd chorus thro' th' embowed roof;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="16"/>'Till all my soul is bath'd in ecstasies,</L>
<L>And lap'd in Paradise. Or let me sit</L>
<L>Far in some distant isle of the deep dome,</L>
<L>There lonesome listen to the solemn sounds,</L>
<L>Which, as they lengthen thro' the Gothic vaults,</L>
<L>In hollow murmurs reach my ravish'd ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor let me fail to cultivate my mind</L>
<L>With the soft thrillings of the tragic Muse,</L>
<L>Divine Melpomene, sweet Pity's nurse,</L>
<L>Queen of the stately step, and flowing pall.</L>
<L>Now let Monimia mourn with streaming eyes</L>
<L>Her joys incestuous, and polluted love:</L>
<L>Now let Calista dye the desperate steel</L>
<L>Within her bosom, for lost innocence,</L>
<L>Unable to behold a father weep.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="17"/>Or Jaffeir kneel for one forgiving look;</L>
<L>Nor seldom let the Moor on Desdemone</L>
<L>Pour the misguided threats of jealous rage.</L>
<L>By soft degrees the manly torrent steals</L>
<L>From my swoln eyes, and at a brother's woe</L>
<L>My big heart melts in sympathizing tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What are the splendors of the gaudy court,</L>
<L>It's tinsel trappings, and it's pageant pomps?</L>
<L>To me far happier seems the banish'd Lord</L>
<L>Amid Siberia's unrejoycing wilds</L>
<L>Who pines all lonesome, in the chambers hoar</L>
<L>Of some high castle shut, whose windows dim</L>
<L>In distant ken discover trackless plains,</L>
<L>Where Winter ever drives his icy car;</L>
<L>While still repeated objects of his view,</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="18"/>The gloomy battlements, and ivied tow'rs</L>
<L>That crown the solitary dome, arise;</L>
<L>While from the topmost turret the slow clock</L>
<L>Far heard along th' inhospitable wastes</L>
<L>With sad-returning chime, awakes new grief;</L>
<L>Than is the Satrap whom he left behind</L>
<L>In Moscow's regal palaces, to drown</L>
<L>In ease and luxury the laughing hours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Illustrious objects strike the gazer's mind</L>
<L>With feeble bliss, and but allure the sight,</L>
<L>Nor rouze with impulse quick the feeling heart.</L>
<L>Thus seen by shepherd from Hymettus' brow,</L>
<L>What painted landschapes spread their charms beneath?</L>
<L>Here palmy groves, amid whose umbrage green</L>
<L>Th' unfading olive lifts her silver head,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="19"/>Resounding once with Plato's voice, arise:</L>
<L>Here vine-clad hills unfold their purple stores,</L>
<L>Here fertile vales their level lap expand,</L>
<L>Amid whose beauties glistering Athens tow'rs.</L>
<L>Tho' thro' the graceful seats Ilissus roll</L>
<L>His sage-inspiring flood, whose fabled banks</L>
<L>The spreading laurel shades, tho' roseate Morn</L>
<L>Pour all her splendors on th' empurpled scene,</L>
<L>Yet feels the musing Hermit truer joys,</L>
<L>As from the cliff that o'er his cavern hangs,</L>
<L>He views the piles of fall'n Persepolis</L>
<L>In deep arrangement hide the darksome plain.</L>
<L>Unbounded waste! the mould'ring Obelisc</L>
<L>Here, like a blasted oak, ascends the clouds;</L>
<L>Here Parian domes their vaulted halls disclose</L>
<L>Horrid with thorn, where lurks the secret thief,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="20"/>Whence flits the twilight-loving bat at eve,</L>
<L>And the deaf adder wreaths her spotted train,</L>
<L>The dwellings once of Elegance and Art.</L>
<L>Here temples rise, amid whose hallow'd bounds</L>
<L>Spires the black pine, while thro' the naked street,</L>
<L>Haunt of the tradeful merchant, springs the grass:</L>
<L>Here columns heap'd on prostrate columns, torn</L>
<L>From their firm base, encrease the mould'ring mass.</L>
<L>Far as the sight can pierce, appear the spoils</L>
<L>Of sunk magnificence: a blended scene</L>
<L>Of moles, fanes, arches, domes, and palaces,</L>
<L>Where, with his brother horror, ruin sits.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O come then, <HI>Melancholy,</HI> queen of thought,</L>
<L>O come with saintly look and stedfast step,</L>
<L>From forth thy cave embower'd with mournful yew,</L>
<L><PB REF="21"/>Where ever to the cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sound</L>
<L>List'ning thou sitt'st, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ress bind</L>
<L>Thy votary's hair, and seal him s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y son.</L>
<L>But never let Euphrosyne beguile</L>
<L>With toys of wanton mirth my fixed mind,</L>
<L>Nor with her primrose garlands strew my paths.</L>
<L>What tho' with her the dimpled Hebe dwells,</L>
<L>With young-ey'd Pleasure, and the loose-rob'd Joy;</L>
<L>Tho' Venus, mother of the Smiles and Loves,</L>
<L>And Bacchus, ivy-crown'd, in myrtle bow'r</L>
<L>With her in dance fantastic beat the ground:</L>
<L>What tho' 'tis her's to calm the blue serene,</L>
<L>And at her presence mild the low'ring clouds</L>
<L>Disperse in air, and o'er the face of heav'n</L>
<L>New day diffusive glows at her approach;</L>
<L>Yet are these joys that Melancholy gives,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="22"/>By Contemplation taught, her sister sage,</L>
<L>Than all her witless revels happier far.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then ever, beauteous Contemplation, hail!</L>
<L>From thee began, auspicious maid, my song,</L>
<L>With thee shall end: for thou art fairer far</L>
<L>Than are the nymphs of Cirrha's mossy grot;</L>
<L>To loftier rapture thou canst wake the thought,</L>
<L>Than all the fabling Poet's boasted pow'rs.</L>
<L>Hail, queen divine! whom, as tradition tells,</L>
<L>Once in his ev'ning-walk a Druid found</L>
<L>Far in a hollow glade of Mona's woods,</L>
<L>And piteous bore with hospitable hand</L>
<L>To the close shelter of his oaken bow'r.</L>
<L>There soon the Sage admiring mark'd the dawn</L>
<L>Of solemn Musing in thy pensive thought;</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="23"/>For when a smiling babe, you lov'd to lie</L>
<L>Oft deeply list'ning to the rapid roar</L>
<L>Of wood-hung Meinai, stream of Druids old,</L>
<L>That lav'd his hallow'd haunt with dashing wave.</L>
