<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO illustrate the following poem, to vin∣dicate the subject from the censure of improbability, and to shew by the concurring evidence of the best historians, that such disinterested public virtue did once exist, I have thought, it would not be improper to prefix the subsequent narration.</P>
<P>WHILE Darius, the father of Xerxes, was yet on the throne of Persia, Cleomenes and Demaratus were kings in Lacedaemon, both descended from Hercules. Demaratus was un∣fortunately expos'd by an uncertain rumour, which render'd his legitimacy suspected, to the
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
malice and treachery of his colleague, who had conceiv'd a personal resentment against him; for Cleomenes taking advantage of this report, persuaded the Spartans to examine into the birth of Demaratus, and refer the difficulty to the oracle of Delphi; and was assisted in his perfidious designs by a near relation of Dema∣ratus, nam'd Leotychides, who aspir'd to suc∣ceed him in his dignity. Cleomenes found means to corrupt the priestess of Delphi, who declar'd Demaratus not legitimate. Thus by the base practices of his colleague Cleomenes, and his kinsman Leotychides, Demaratus was expell'd from his office of king in the commonwealth, after having frequently signaliz'd his valour in its service. He went into voluntary banish∣ment, and retiring to Asia was there protected by Darius; while Leotychides succeeded to the regal authority in Sparta. Upon the death of Cleomenes Leonidas was made king, who rul'd in conjunction with this Leotychides, when Xerxes, the son of Darius, invaded Greece. The
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
number of land and naval forces, which accom∣panied that monarch, together with the servants, women, and other usual attendants on the army of an eastern prince, amounted to upwards of five millions, as reported by Herodotus, who wrote within a few years after the event, and pub∣licly recited his history at the Olympic games. In this general assembly not only from Greece itself, but from every part of the world, where∣ever a colony of Grecians was planted, had he greatly exceeded the truth, he must certainly have been detected, and censur'd by some a∣mong so great a multitude, and such a vo∣luntary falshood must have entirely destroy'd that merit and authority, which have procur'd to Herodotus the veneration of all posterity, with the appellation of the father of history. On the first news of this attempt upon their li∣berty a convention was immediately held at the Isthmus of Corinth, compos'd of deputies from the several states of Greece, to consult on proper measures for the public safety. The Spartans
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
also sent messengers to enquire of the oracle at Delphi into the event of the war, who return'd with an answer from the priestess of Apollo, that either a king descended from Hercules must die, or Lacedaemon would be entirely de∣stroy'd. Leonidas immediately offer'd to sa∣crifice his life for the safety of Lacedaemon, and marching to Thermopylae possess'd himself of that important pass with three hundred of his countrymen; who with the forces of some o∣ther cities in the Peloponnesus, together with the Thebans, Thespians, and the troops of those states, which adjoin'd to Thermopylae, compos'd an army of near eight thousand men.</P>
<P>XERXES was now advanc'd as far, as Thessalia; when hearing, that a small body of Grecians was assembled at Thermopylae, with some Lacedaemonians at their head, and among the rest Leonidas, a descendant of Hercules, he dispatch'd a single horseman before to ob∣serve
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
their numbers, and discover their designs. When this horseman approach'd, he could not take a view of the whole camp, which lay con∣ceal'd behind a rampart formerly rais'd by the Phocians at the entrance of Thermopylae; so that his whole attention was employ'd on those, who were on guard before the wall, and who at that instant chanc'd to be the Lacedaemo∣nians. Their manner and gestures greatly as∣tonish'd the Persian; some were amusing them∣selves in gymnastic exercises; others were comb∣ing their hair; and all discover'd a total disregard of him, whom they suffer'd to depart without molestation, and report to Xerxes, what he had seen: which appearing to that prince quite ri∣diculous, he sent for Demaratus, who was with him in the camp, and requir'd him to ex∣plain this strange behaviour of his countrymen. Demaratus inform'd him, that it was a custom among the Spartans to comb down and ad∣just their hair, when they were determin'd to fight till the last extremity. Xerxes notwith∣standing
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
in the confidence of his power sent am∣bassadors to the Grecians to demand their arms, to bid them disperse, and become his friends and allies; which proposals being receiv'd with dis∣dain, he commanded the Medes and Saces to seize on the Grecians, and bring them alive into his presence. These nations immediately at∣tack'd the Grecians, and were soon repuls'd with great slaughter; fresh troops still succeed∣ed, but with no better fortune than the first, being oppos'd to an enemy not only superiour in valour and resolution, but who had the ad∣vantage of discipline, and were furnish'd with better arms both offensive and defensive.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH in his Laconic apothegms re∣ports, that the Persian king offer'd to invest Leonidas with the sovereignty of all Greece, provided he would join his arms to those of Per∣sia. This offer was too considerable a conde∣scension to have been made before a tryal of their force, and must therefore have been propos'd by
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
Xerxes, after such a series of ill success, as might probably have depress'd the insolence of his temper; and it may be easily suppos'd, that the virtue of Leonidas was proof against any temptations of that nature. Whether this be a fact, or not, thus much is certain, that Xerxes was reduc'd to extreme difficulties by this reso∣lute defence of Thermopylae; till he was extri∣cated from his distress by a Malian nam'd Epi∣altes, who conducted twenty thousand of the Persian army into Greece through a pass, which lay higher up the country among the mountains of Oeta: whereas the passage at Thermopylae was situated on the sea-shore between the end of those mountains and the Malian bay. The de∣fence of the upper pass had been committed to a thousand Phocians, who upon the first sight of the enemy inconsiderately abandon'd their station, and put themselves in array upon a neighbouring eminence; but the Persians wisely avoided an engagement, and with the utmost expedition march'd to Thermopylae. Leonidas
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
no sooner receiv'd information, that the Barba∣rians had pass'd the mountains, but he command∣ed the allies to retreat, reserving the three hundred Spartans, and four hundred Thebans, whom, as they follow'd him with reluctance at first, he now compell'd to stay. But the Thespians, whose number amounted to seven hundred, would not be persuaded by Leonidas to forsake him. Their commander was Demophilus, and the most eminent amongst them for his va∣lour was Dithyrambus. Among the Spartans the most conspicuous next to Leonidas was Di∣eneces, who being told, that the multitude of Persian arrows would obscure the sun, replied, the battle would then be in the shade. Two bro∣thers named Alpheus and Maron are also record∣ed for their valour, and were Lacedaemonians. Megistias a priest, by birth an Acarnanian, re∣fus'd to desert Leonidas, though intreated by him to consult his safety, and retire; but sent away his only son, and remain'd himself be∣hind to die with the Lacedaemonians. Among
<PB N="ix" REF="11"/>
the three hundred Spartans were two call'd Eurytus and Aristodemus, who being almost blind were dismiss'd by Leonidas. Of these Aristodemus return'd home; but Eurytus wait∣ed, till the Persians descended from the hills, and then commanding his slave to lead him a∣mong the combatants was slain with the rest of his countrymen.</P>
<P>HERODOTUS relates, that Leonidas drew up his men in the broadest part of Thermopy∣lae; where, being surrounded by the Persians, they fell with great numbers of their ene∣mies: but Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, and o∣thers affirm, that the Grecians attack'd the ve∣ry camp of Xerxes in the night. The action is thus describ'd by Diodorus. <Q REND="margQuotes">"The Grecians having now rejected all thoughts of safety, preferring glory to life, unanimously call'd on their general to lead them against the Per∣sians, before they could be appris'd, that their friends had pass'd round the mountains.
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
Leonidas embrac'd the occasion, which the ready zeal of his soldiers afforded, and com∣manded them forthwith to dine, as men, who were to sup in Elysium. Himself in conse∣quence of this command took a repast, as the means to furnish strength for a long continuance, and to give perseverance in danger. After a short refreshment the Gre∣cians were now prepar'd, and receiv'd orders to assail the enemies camp, to put all, they met, to the sword, and force a passage to the royal pavilion; when, form'd into one compact body with Leonidas himself at their head, they march'd against the Persians, and enter'd their camp at the dead of night. The Barbarians wholly unprepar'd, and blindly conjecturing, that their friends were defeat∣ed, and themselves attack'd by the united power of Greece, hurry together from their tents with the utmost disorder and consterna∣tion. Many were slain by Leonidas and his party, but much greater multitudes by their
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
own troops, to whom in the midst of this blind confusion they were not distinguishable from enemies: for as night took away the power of discerning truely, and the tumult was spread universally over the camp, a pro∣digious slaughter must naturally ensue. The want of command, of a watch-word, and of confidence in themselves reduc'd the Persians to such a state of confusion, that they de∣stroy'd each other without distinction. Had Xerxes continu'd in the royal pavilion, the Grecians without difficulty might have brought the war to a speedy conclusion by his death; but he at the beginning of the tumult betook himself to flight with the ut∣most precipitation; when the Grecians rush∣ing into the tent, put to the sword most of those, who were left behind: then, while night lasted, they rang'd through the whole camp in diligent search of the tyrant. When morning appear'd, the Persians perceiving the true state of things, held the inconsiderable
<PB N="xii" REF="14"/>
number of their enemies in contempt; yet were so terrified at their valour, that they avoided a near engagement; but inclosing the Grecians on every side shower'd their darts and arrows upon them at a distance, and in the end destroy'd their whole body. Such was the pe∣riod of their lives, who under the conduct of Leonidas defended the pass of Thermopy∣lae. Who can refrain from admiring the virtue of these men, who with one consent maintaining the post allotted by their country chearfully renounc'd their lives for the com∣mon safety of Greece, and esteem'd a glori∣ous death more eligible than to live with dis∣honour? Nor is the consternation of the Persians incredible. Who among those Bar∣barians could have conjectur'd such an event? who could have expected, that five hundred men would have dar'd to attack a million? Wherefore shall not all posterity from that day reflect on the virtue of these men as the object of imitation, who, though the loss of
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
their lives was the necessary consequence of their undertaking, were yet unconquer'd in their spirit; and among all the great names deliver'd down to remembrance are the only heroes, who obtain'd more glory in their fall than others from the brightest victories? With justice may they be deem'd the pre∣servers of the Grecian liberty, even prefer∣ably to those, who were conquerors in the battles fought afterwards with Xerxes; for the memory of their valour, who fell at Thermopylae, for ever dejected the Barbarians, while the Greeks were fir'd with emulation to equal such a pitch of magnanimity. Upon the whole there never were any before these, who attain'd to immortality through the meer excess of virtue; whence the praise of their fortitude has not been recorded by hi∣storians only, but has been celebrated by numbers of poets, among others by Simoni∣des the lyric."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="16"/>
PAUSANIAS in his Laconics considers the defence of Thermopylae, as an action superior to any atchiev'd by their cotemporaries, and to all the exploits of preceding ages. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Never (says he) had Xerxes beheld Greece, or laid in ashes the city of Athens, had not his forces under Hydarnes been conducted through a path over Oeta, and by that means incom∣passing the Greeks overcome and slain Leo∣nidas."</Q> Nor is it improbable, that Leonidas should have maintain'd his post in so narrow a pass, till the whole army of Xerxes had pe∣rish'd by famine. At the same time the Per∣sian navy had been miserably shatter'd by a storm, and worsted in an engagement with the Athenians at Artemisium.</P>
<P>To conclude, the fall of Leonidas and his brave companions, so meritorious to their coun∣try, and so glorious to themselves, has obtain'd such an high degree of veneration and applause
<PB N="xv" REF="17"/>
from past ages, that few among the antient compilers of history have been silent on this amazing instance of magnanimity and zeal for liberty; and many are the epigrams and in∣scriptions now extant, some on the whole body, others on particulars, who died at Thermopy∣lae, still preserving their memory in every na∣tion conversant with learning, and at this dis∣tance of time still rendring their virtue the ob∣ject of admiration and praise.</P>
<P>I SHALL now detain the reader no longer, than to take this public occasion of expressing my sincere regard for the LORD VISCOUNT COBHAM, and the sense of my obligations for the early honour of his friendship. To him I inscribe the following poem; and herein might I be justified, independent of all personal motives, from his Lordship's public conduct so highly distinguish'd by his disinterested zeal, and unsha∣ken fidelity to his country, not less in civil life
<PB N="xvi" REF="18"/>
than in the field: and to whom a poem found∣ed on a character eminent for military glory, and love of liberty is due from the nature of the subject.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Xerxes king of Persia having drawn together the whole force of his empire, and pass'd over the Hellespont into Thrace with a design to conquer Greece; the deputies from the several states of that country, who had some time before assembled themselves at the Isthmus of Corinth to deliberate on proper measures for resisting the invader, were no sooner appris'd of his march into Thrace, than they determin'd without further delay to dispute his passage at the straits of Thermopylae, the most accessible part of Greece on the side of Thrace and Thessaly. Alpheus, one of the deputies from Sparta, repairs to that city, and communicates this resolution to his countrymen; who chanced that day to be assembled in expectation of receiving an answer from Apollo, to whom they had sent a messenger to consult about the event of the war. Leotychides, one of their two kings, counsels the people to advance no further, than the Isthmus of Corinth, which separates the Peloponnesus, where Lacedaemon was situated, from the rest of Greece; but Leonidas, the other king, dissuades them from it. Agis, the messenger, who had
<PB N="2" REF="20"/>
been deputed to Delphi, and brother to the queen of Leonidas, returns with the oracle; which denounces ruin to the Lacedaemonians, unless one of their kings lays down his life for the publick. Leonidas offers himself for the victim. Three hundred Spartans are chosen to accompany him to Thermopylae, and Alpheus returns to the Isthmus. Leonidas, after an interview with his queen, departs from Lacedaemon. At the end of six days, he encamps near the Isthmus, when he is join'd by Alpheus; who describes the auxiliaries, that wait at the Isthmus, those, who are already possess'd of Thermopylae, as also the pass itself; and concludes with a relation of the captivity of his brother Polydorus in Persia.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>REHEARSE, O Muse, the deeds and glorious death</L>
<L>Of that fam'd Spartan, who withstood the pow'r</L>
<L>Of Xerxes near Thermopylae, and fell</L>
<L>To save his country. When from Asia's coast</L>
<L N="5">With half the nations of the peopled globe</L>
<L>The Persian king the Hellespont had pass'd,</L>
<L>And now in Thrace his boundless camp was spread;</L>
<L>Soon to the Isthmus, where th'assembled chiefs</L>
<L>Of Greece in anxious council long had sat,</L>
<L N="10">How best their menac'd liberties to guard,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="21"/>
The dreadful tidings reach'd. The near approach</L>
<L>Of Asia's lord determines their resolves.</L>
<L>These they convey to all the Grecian states.</L>
<L>Back to Eurotas' shores, where Sparta rose,</L>
<L N="15">Laconian Alpheus speeds: in council there</L>
<L>He finds the Spartan people with their kings;</L>
<L>Their kings, who boast an origin divine,</L>
<L>From Hercules descended. They the sons</L>
<L>Of Lacedaemon had conven'd to learn</L>
<L N="20">The sacred mandates of th' immortal Gods,</L>
<L>That morn expected from the Delphian dome;</L>
<L>But in their presence Alpheus first appear'd,</L>
<L>And thus address'd them. For immediate war</L>
<L>Prepare, O Spartans. Xerxes' num'rous pow'rs</L>
<L N="25">Already fill the trembling bounds of Thrace.</L>
<L>The Isthmian council hath decreed to guard</L>
<L>The strait and rocky entrance into Greece,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="22"/>
Thermopylae; where ev'n a slender force</L>
<L>May stem the torrent of unnumber'd foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="30">HE said, when Leotychides, who shar'd</L>
<L>The rule with great Leonidas, bespake</L>
<L>The Spartans thus. My countrymen give ear.</L>
<L>Why from her bosom should Laconia send</L>
<L>Her valiant sons to wage a distant war</L>
<L N="35">For others' safety; why exhaust her strength</L>
<L>And thin her numbers in defence of those,</L>
<L>Who far remote from Lacedaemon dwell</L>
<L>Beyond the Isthmus? there the Gods have plac'd</L>
<L>Our native ramparts, there our empire's bound;</L>
<L N="40">And there alone our country claims our swords.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE ceas'd. The people with assenting shouts</L>
<L>Replied, when thus Leonidas began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="23"/>
<L>O MOST ungen'rous counsel! most unjust,</L>
<L>And base desertion of the Grecian weal!</L>
<L N="45">What! shall th'Athenians, whose assiduous fleets</L>
<L>Undaunted watch th' innumerable foes,</L>
<L>Where'er they menace our affrighted shores,</L>
<L>And trust th' impending dangers of the field</L>
<L>To Sparta's well-known valour; shall they hear,</L>
<L N="50">That we, disowning thus the gen'ral cause,</L>
<L>Maintain the Isthmus only, and expose</L>
<L>The rest of Greece, ev'n Athens, while she guards</L>
<L>Our naked coasts, to all the waste of war,</L>
<L>Her walls to ruin, and her fields to flames,</L>
<L N="55">Her sons, her matrons, and her hoary sires</L>
<L>To violation, servitude, and shame?</L>
<L>O should they hear such counsels guide our state,</L>
<L>Would they not court the first propitious gale</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="24"/>
To waft them far from such perfidious friends,</L>
<L N="60">And raise new seats in other climes remote,</L>
<L>Safe from insulting foes, and false allies?</L>
<L>Then should we soon behold the proud array</L>
<L>Of Xerxes' navy with their hostile beaks</L>
<L>Affront our shores, and deluge all our fields</L>
<L N="65">With inexhausted numbers. Half the Greeks,</L>
<L>By us betray'd to bondage, would support</L>
<L>The Persian king, and lift th' avenging spear</L>
<L>For our destruction. But my friends reject</L>
<L>Such mean and dang'rous counsels, which will blast</L>
<L N="70">Your long establish'd glories, and assist</L>
<L>The proud invader. O eternal king</L>
<L>Of Gods and mortals elevate our minds!</L>
<L>Each low and partial passion thence dispel!</L>
<L>Till this great truth in ev'ry heart be known,</L>
<L N="75">That none, but those, who aid the publick cause,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="25"/>
Can shield their countries, or themselves from chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE said, by shame suppress'd each clam'rous voice</L>
<L>Was lost in silence; till a gen'ral shout</L>
<L>Proclaim'd th' approach of Agis from the fane,</L>
<L N="80">Where, taught by Phoebus on the Delphic hill,</L>
<L>The Pythian maid his oracles reveal'd.</L>
<L>He came; but discontent and grief o'ercast</L>
<L>His anxious brow. Reluctant he advanc'd,</L>
<L>And now prepar'd to speak. Th' impatient throng</L>
<L N="85">Was gather'd round him; motionless they stood</L>
<L>With expectation; not a whisper told</L>
<L>The silent fear, but all on Agis gaze;</L>
<L>And still as death attend the solemn tale.</L>
<L>As o'er the western waves, when ev'ry storm</L>
<L N="90">Is hush'd within its cavern, and a breeze</L>
<L>Soft-breathing lightly with its wings along</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="26"/>
The slacken'd cordage glides, the sailor's ear</L>
<L>Perceives no sound throughout the vast expanse;</L>
<L>None, but the murmurs of the sliding prowe,</L>
<L N="95">Which slowly parts the smooth and yielding main:</L>
<L>So through the wide and listning croud no sound,</L>
<L>No voice, but thine, O Agis, broke the air,</L>
<L>Declaring thus the oracle divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I WENT to Delphi; I enquir'd what fate</L>
<L N="100">Was doom'd to Sparta from th'impending war;</L>
<L>When thus th' all-seeing deity replied.</L>
<L>"Inhabitants of Sparta, Persia's arms</L>
<L>"Shall lay your proud and ancient seat in dust;</L>
<L>"Unless a king from Hercules deriv'd</L>
<L N="105">"Cause Lacedaemon for his death to mourn."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AS, when the hand of Perseus had disclos'd</L>
<L>The snakes of dirc Medusa; all, who view'd</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="27"/>
The Gorgon features, were congeal'd to stone,</L>
<L>With ghastly eye-balls on the hero bent,</L>
<L N="110">And horrour living in their marble form:</L>
<L>Thus with amazement rooted, where they stood,</L>
<L>And froze with speechless terrour, on their kings</L>
<L>The Spartans gaz'd: but soon their anxious looks</L>
<L>All on the great Leonidas unite,</L>
<L N="115">Long known his country's refuge. He alone</L>
<L>Remains unshaken. Rising, he displays</L>
<L>His godlike presence. Dignity and grace</L>
<L>Adorn his frame, and manly beauty join'd</L>
<L>With strength Herculean. On his aspect shines</L>
<L N="120">Sublimest virtue, and desire of fame,</L>
<L>Where justice gives the laurel; in his eye</L>
<L>The inextinguishable spark, which fires</L>
<L>The souls of patriots: while his brow supports</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="28"/>
Undaunted valour, and contempt of death.</L>
<L N="125">Serene he rose, and thus address'd the throng.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHY this astonishment on ev'ry face,</L>
<L>Ye men of Sparta? Does the name of death</L>
<L>Create this fear and wonder? O my friends!</L>
<L>Why do we labour through the arduous paths,</L>
<L N="130">Which lead to virtue? Fruitless were the toil,</L>
<L>Above the reach of human feet were plac'd</L>
<L>The distant summit, if the fear of death</L>
<L>Could intercept our passage. But in vain</L>
<L>His blackest frowns and terrours he assumes</L>
<L N="135">To shake the firmness of the mind, which knows,</L>
<L>That wanting virtue life is pain and woe,</L>
<L>That wanting liberty ev'n virtue mourns,</L>
<L>And looks around for happiness in vain.</L>
<L>Then speak, O Sparta, and demand my life;</L>
<L N="140"><PB N="11" REF="29"/>
My heart exulting answers to thy call,</L>
<L>And smiles on glorious fate. To live with fame</L>
<L>The Gods allow to many; but to die</L>
<L>With equal lustre, is a blessing, Heav'n</L>
<L>Selects from all the choicest boons of fate,</L>
<L N="145">And with a sparing hand on few bestows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE said. New wonder fix'd the gazing throng.</L>
<L>In silence Joy and Admiration sat,</L>
<L>Suspending praise. At length with high acclaim</L>
<L>The arch of heav'n resounded, when amid</L>
<L N="150">Th' assembly stood Dieneces, and spake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO from Thermopylae may Sparta's shouts</L>
<L>Affright the ear of Asia! Haste, my friends,</L>
<L>To guard the gates of Greece, which open stand</L>
<L>To Tyranny and Rapine. They with dread</L>
<L N="155"><PB N="12" REF="30"/>
Will shrink before your standards, and again</L>
<L>In servile Persia seek their native seats.</L>
<L>Your wives, your sons, your parents, general Greece</L>
<L>Forbid delay; and equal to the cause</L>
<L>A chief behold: can Spartans ask for more?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="160">HE ceas'd; when Alpheus thus. It well becomes</L>
<L>The Spartans held the chiefs of Greece, and fam'd</L>
<L>For dauntless courage, and unyielding hearts,</L>
<L>Which neither want, nor pain, nor death, can bend,</L>
<L>To lead the rest to battle. Then with speed</L>
<L N="165">From all your number form a chosen band,</L>
<L>While I returning, will my seat resume</L>
<L>Among the Isthmian council, and declare</L>
<L>Your instant march. Our brave allies, I deem,</L>
<L>Now on the Isthmus wait the Spartan king;</L>
<L N="170">All but the Locrian and Boeotian force,</L>

With Phocis' youth, appointed to secure</L>

To Alpheus dear, his brother, and his friend.</L>
<L>Then rose Megistias with his blooming heir,</L>
<L>Joy of his age, and Menalippus call'd;</L>
<L>Megistias, wise and venerable seer,</L>
<L N="190">Whose penetrating mind, as fame records,</L>
<L>Could from the entrails of the victim slain</L>
<L>Before the altar, and the mystic flight</L>
<L>Of birds foresee the dark events of time.</L>
<L>Though sprung a stranger on the distant shore</L>
<L N="195">Of Acarnania, for his worth receiv'd,</L>
<L>And hospitably cherish'd; he the wreath</L>

<L>Serene in danger, nor his sacred arm</L>
<L>From warlike toils secluding, nor unskill'd</L>
<L N="200">To wield the sword, or poize the weighty spear.</L>
<L>Him Agis follow'd, brother to the queen</L>
<L>Of great Leonidas; his friend, in war</L>

His tried companion. Graceful were his steps,</L>
<L>And gentle his demeanour. Still his soul</L>
<L N="205">Preserv'd its rigid virtue, though refin'd</L>
<L>With arts unknown to Lacedaemon's race.</L>
<L>High was his office. He, when Sparta's weal</L>
<L>Their aid and counsel from the Gods requir'd,</L>
<L>Was sent the sacred messenger to learn</L>
<L N="210">Their mystic will in oracles declar'd</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L N="215">BUT to his home Leonidas retir'd.</L>
<L>There calm in secret thought he thus explor'd</L>
<L>His mighty soul, while nature to his breast</L>
<L>A short-liv'd terrour call'd. What sudden grief,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="34"/>
What cold reluctance thus unmans my heart,</L>
<L N="220">And whispers, that I fear?—Can death dismay</L>
<L>Leonidas, so often seen and scorn'd,</L>
<L>When clad most dreadful in the battle's front?—</L>
<L>Or to relinquish life in all its pride,</L>
<L>With all my honours blooming round my head,</L>
<L N="225">Repines my soul? or rather to forsake,</L>
<L>Eternally forsake my weeping wife,</L>
<L>My infant offspring, and my faithful friends?—</L>
<L>Leonidas awake! Shall these withstand</L>
<L>The public safety? Lo! thy country calls.</L>
<L N="230">O sacred voice, I hear thee! At that sound</L>
<L>Returning virtue brightens in my heart;</L>
<L>Fear vanishes before her; Death receive</L>
<L>My unreluctant hand, and lead me on.</L>
<L>Thou too, O Fame, attendant on my fall,</L>
<L N="235"><PB N="17" REF="35"/>
With wings unwearied shalt protect my tomb,</L>
<L>Nor Time himself shall violate my praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE hero thus confirm'd his virtuous soul,</L>
<L>When Agis enter'd. If till now my tongue</L>
<L>(He thus began) O brother, has delay'd</L>
<L N="240">To pay its grateful off'ring of the praise,</L>
<L>Thy merit claims, and only fill'd the cries</L>
<L>Of general applause, forgive thy friend;</L>
<L>Since her distresses, hers, whom most you love,</L>
<L>Detain'd me from thee. O unequall'd man!</L>
<L N="245">Though Lacedaemon call thy first regard,</L>
<L>Forget not her, who now for thee laments</L>
<L>In sorrows, which fraternal love in vain</L>
<L>Hath strove to sooth. Leonidas embrac'd</L>
<L>His gen'rous friend, and thus replied. Most dear</L>
<L N="250">And best of men! conceive not, but my heart</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="36"/>
Must still remember her, from whom my life</L>
<L>Its largest share of happiness derives.</L>
<L>Can I, who yield my breath, lest others mourn,</L>
<L>Lest thousands should be wretched; when she pines,</L>
<L N="255">More lov'd than any, though less dear than all,</L>
<L>Can I neglect her griefs! In future days</L>
<L>If thou with grateful memory record</L>
<L>My name and fate, O Sparta, pass not this</L>
<L>Unheeded by. The life, I gave for thee,</L>
<L N="260">Knew not a painful hour to tire my soul,</L>
<L>Nor were they common joys, I left behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO spake the patriot, and his heart o'erflow'd</L>
<L>With fondest passion; then in eager haste</L>
<L>The faithful partner of his bed he sought.</L>
<L N="265">Amid her weeping children sat the queen,</L>
<L>Immoveable and mute; her swimming eyes</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="37"/>
Fix'd on the earth. Her arms were folded o'er</L>
<L>Her lab'ring bosom blotted with her tears.</L>
<L>As, when a dusky mist involves the sky,</L>
<L N="270">The moon through all the dreary vapours spreads</L>
<L>The radiant vesture of its silver light</L>
<L>O'er the dull face of nature; so her charms</L>

<L N="275">Soon as in gentlest phrase his well-known voice</L>

<L>Its cares were hush'd: she lifts her languid head,</L>
<L>And thus gives utt'rance to her tender thoughts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O THOU, whose presence is my only joy,</L>
<L N="280">If thus, Leonidas, thy looks and voice</L>
<L>Can dissipate at once the sharpest pangs,</L>
<L>How greatly am I wretched; who no more</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="38"/>
Must hear that voice, which lulls my anguish thus,</L>
<L>Nor see that face, which makes affliction smile!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="285">THIS said, returning grief her breast invades.</L>
<L>Her orphan children, her devoted lord</L>
<L>Pale, bleeding, breathless on the field of death,</L>
<L>Her ever-during solitude of woe,</L>
<L>All rise in mingled horrour to her sight,</L>
<L N="290">When thus in bitt'rest agony she spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O WHITHER art thou going from my arms!</L>
<L>Shall I no more behold thee! Oh! no more</L>
<L>In conquest clad, and wrapt in glorious dust</L>
<L>Wilt thou return to greet thy native soil,</L>
<L N="295">And make thy dwelling joyfull Yet, too brave,</L>
<L>Why wouldst thou hasten to the dreary gates</L>
<L>Of death, uncall'd? Another might have fall'n,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="39"/>
Like thee a victim of Alcides' race,</L>
<L>Less dear to all, and Sparta been secure.</L>
<L N="300">Now ev'ry eye with mine is drown'd in tears,</L>
<L>All with these babes lament their father lost.</L>
<L>But oh! how heavy is our lot of pain!</L>
<L>Our sighs must last, when ev'ry other breast</L>
<L>Exults with transport, and the public joy</L>
<L N="305">Will but increase our anguish. Yet unmov'd,</L>
<L>Thou didst not heed our sorrows, didst not seek</L>
<L>A moment's pause, to teach us how to bear</L>
<L>Thy endless absence, or like thee to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>UNUTTERABLE sorrow here confin'd</L>
<L N="310">Her voice. These words Leonidas return'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I SEE, I feel thy anguish, nor my soul</L>
<L>Has ever known the prevalence of love,</L>
<L>E'er prov'd a father's fondness, as this hour;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="40"/>
Nor, when most ardent to assert my fame,</L>
<L N="315">Was once my heart insensible to thee.</L>
<L>How had it stain'd the honours of my name</L>
<L>To hesitate a moment, and suspend</L>
<L>My country's fate, till shameful life prefer'd</L>
<L>By my inglorious colleague left no choice,</L>
<L N="320">But what in me were infamy to shun,</L>
<L>Not virtue to accept? Then deem no more,</L>
<L>That of thy love regardless, or thy tears,</L>
<L>I haste uncall'd to death. The voice of Fate,</L>
<L>The Gods, my fame, my country bid me bleed.</L>
<L N="325">—Oh! thou dear mourner! wherefore streams afresh</L>
<L>That flood of woe? Why heaves with sighs renew'd</L>
<L>That tender breast? Leonidas must fall.</L>
<L>Alas! far heavier misery impends</L>
<L>O'er thee and these, if soften'd by thy tears</L>
<L N="330">I shamefully refuse to yield that breath,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="41"/>
Which justice, glory, liberty, and heav'n</L>
<L>Claim for my country, for my sons, and thee.</L>
<L>Think on my long unalter'd love. Reflect</L>
<L>On my paternal fondness. Has my heart</L>
<L N="335">E'er known a pause of love, or pious care?</L>
<L>Now shall that care, that tenderness be prov'd</L>
<L>Most warm and faithful. When thy husband dies.</L>
<L>For Lacedaemon's safety, thou wilt share,</L>
<L>Thou and thy children, the diffusive good.</L>
<L N="340">Should I, thus singled from the rest of men,</L>
<L>Alone intrusted by th 'immortal Gods</L>
<L>With pow'r to save a people, should my soul</L>
<L>Desert that sacred cause, thee too I yield</L>
<L>To sorrow, and to shame; for thou must weep</L>
<L N="345">With Lacedaemon, must with her sustain</L>
<L>Thy painful portion of oppression's weight.</L>
<L>Thy sons behold now worthy of their names,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="42"/>
And Spartan birth. Their growing bloom must pine</L>
<L>In shame and bondage, and their youthful hearts</L>
<L N="350">Beat at the sound of liberty no more.</L>
<L>On their own virtue, and their father's fame,</L>
<L>When he the Spartan freedom hath confirm'd,</L>
<L>Before the world illustrious shall they rise,</L>
<L>Their country's bulwark, and their mother's joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="355">HERE paus'd the patriot. With religious awe</L>
<L>Grief heard the voice of Virtue. No complaint</L>
<L>The solemn silence broke. Tears ceas'd to flow:</L>
<L>Ceas'd for a moment; soon again to stream.</L>
<L>For now in arms before the palace rang'd</L>
<L N="360">His brave companions of the war demand</L>
<L>Their leader's presence; then her griefs renew'd,</L>
<L>Too great for utt'rance, intercept her sighs,</L>
<L>And freeze each accent on her falt'ring tongue.</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="43"/>
In speechless anguish on the hero's breast</L>
<L N="365">She sinks. On ev'ry side his children press,</L>
<L>Hang on his knees, and kiss his honour'd hand.</L>
<L>His soul no longer struggles to confine</L>
<L>Its strong compunction. Down the hero's cheek,</L>
<L>Down flows the manly sorrow. Great in woe</L>
<L N="370">Amid his children, who inclose him round,</L>
<L>He stands indulging tenderness and love</L>
<L>In graceful tears; when thus with lifted eyes</L>
<L>Address'd to heav'n: Thou ever-living pow'r</L>
<L>Look down propitious, sire of Gods and men!</L>
<L N="375">And to this faithful woman, whose desert</L>
<L>May claim thy favour, grant the hours of peace.</L>
<L>And thou, my great forefather, son of Jove,</L>
<L>O Hercules, neglect not these thy race!</L>
<L>But since that spirit, I from thee derive,</L>
<L N="380">Now bears me from them to resistless fate,</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="44"/>
Do thou support their virtue! be they taught,</L>
<L>Like thee, with glorious labour life to grace,</L>
<L>And from their father let them learn to die!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO saying, forth he issues, and assumes</L>
<L N="385">Before the band his station of command.</L>
<L>They now proceed. So mov'd the host of heav'n</L>
<L>Down from Olympus in majestic march,</L>
<L>On Jove attendant to the flaming plains</L>
<L>Of Phlegra, there to face the giant sons</L>
<L N="390">Of Earth and Titan: he before them tow'r'd.</L>
<L>Thus through the streets of Lacedaemon pass'd</L>
<L>Leonidas. Before his footsteps bow</L>
<L>The multitude exulting. On he treads</L>
<L>Rever'd and honour'd. Their inraptur'd sight</L>
<L N="395">Pursues his graceful stature, and their tongues</L>
<L>Extol and hail him as their guardian God.</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="45"/>
Firm in his nervous hand he grasps his spear.</L>
<L>Down from his shoulders to his ankles hangs</L>
<L>The massy shield, and o'er his burnish'd helm</L>
<L N="400">The purple plumage nods. Harmonious youths,</L>
<L>Around whose brows entwining laurels play'd,</L>
<L>In lofty-sounding strains his praise record;</L>
<L>While snowy-finger'd virgins all the ways</L>
<L>With od'rous garlands strew'd. His bosom now</L>
<L N="405">Was all possess'd with glory, which dispell'd</L>
<L>Whate'er of grief remain'd, or fond regret</L>
<L>For those, he left behind. The rev'rend train</L>
<L>Of Lacedaemon's senate now approach'd</L>
<L>To give their solemn, last farewel, and grace</L>
<L N="410">Their hero's parting steps. Around him flow'd</L>
<L>In civil pomp their venerable robes</L>
<L>Mix'd with the blaze of arms. The radiant troop</L>
<L>Of warriours press'd behind him. Maron here,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="46"/>
With Menalippus warm in flow'ry prime,</L>
<L N="415">And Agis there with manly grace advanc'd,</L>
<L>Dieneces, and Acarnania's seer,</L>
<L>Megistias sage. The Spartan dames ascend</L>
<L>The loftiest domes, and thronging o'er the roofs</L>
<L>Gaze on their sons and husbands, as they march.</L>
<L N="420">So parted Argo from th' Iolchian strand,</L>
<L>And plough'd the foaming surge. Thessalia's nymphs</L>
<L>Their hills forsaking, and their hallow'd groves,</L>
<L>Rang'd on the cliffs, which overshade the deep,</L>
<L>Still on the distant vessel fix'd their sight;</L>
<L N="425">Where Greece her chosen heroes had embark'd</L>
<L>To seek the dangers of the Cholchian shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SWIFT on his course Leonidas proceeds.</L>
<L>Soon is Eurotas pass'd, and Lerna's banks,</L>
<L>Where his unconquer'd ancestor subdu'd</L>
<L N="430"><PB N="29" REF="47"/>
The many-headed Hydra, and with fame</L>
<L>Immortaliz'd the lake. Th'unwearied bands</L>
<L>Next through the pines of Maenalus he led,</L>
<L>And down Parthenius urg'd the rapid toil.</L>
<L>Six days incessant thus the Spartans march,</L>
<L N="435">When now they hear the hoarse-resounding tide</L>
<L>Beat on the Isthmus. Here their tents they spread.</L>
<L>Below the wide horizon then the sun</L>
<L>Had sunk his beamy head. The queen of night</L>
<L>Gleam'd from the center of th'ethereal vault,</L>
<L N="440">And o'er the dusky robe of darkness shed</L>
<L>Her silver light. Leonidas detains</L>
<L>Dieneces and Agis. Open stands</L>
<L>The tall pavilion, and admits the moon.</L>
<L>As here they sat conversing, from the hill,</L>
<L N="445">Which rose before them, one of noble port</L>
<L>Appears with speed descending. Lightly down</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="48"/>
The slope he treads, and calls aloud. They heard,</L>
<L>And knew the voice of Alpheus. From their seats</L>
<L>They rose, and thus Leonidas began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O THOU, whom heav'n with swiftness hath endu'd</L>
<L N="451">To match the ardour of thy daring soul,</L>
<L>What calls thee from the Isthmus? Do the Greeks</L>
<L>Neglect to arm, nor face the public foe?</L>

<L>I COME to meet thee (Alpheus thus return'd)</L>
<L N="455">A messenger, who gladsome tidings bears.</L>
<L>Through Greece the voice of liberty is heard,</L>
<L>And all unfold their banners in her cause;</L>
<L>The Thebans only with reluctant hands.</L>
<L>Arcadia's sons with morning shalt thou join,</L>
<L N="460">Who on the Isthmus wait thy great command.</L>
<L>With Diophantus Mantinéa sends</L>
<L>Five hundred spears; nor less from Tegea's walls</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="49"/>
With Hegesander move. A thousand more,</L>
<L>Who in Orchomenus reside, who range</L>
<L N="465">Along Parrhasius, and Cyllene's brow,</L>
<L>Or near the foot of Erymanthus dwell,</L>
<L>Or on Alphéus' banks, with various chiefs,</L>
<L>Attend thy call; but most is Clonius fam'd</L>
<L>Of stature huge: unshaken as a rock,</L>
<L N="470">His giant bulk the line of war sustains.</L>
<L>Four hundred warriours brave Alcmaeon draws</L>
<L>From stately Corinth's tow'rs. Two hundred march</L>
<L>From Phlius, whom Eupalamus commands.</L>
<L>An equal number of Mycenae's race</L>
<L N="475">Aristobulus heads. Through fear alone</L>
<L>Of thee, and threatning Greece the Thebans arm.</L>
<L>To these inglorious Greeks my self repair'd</L>
<L>Their dying sense of honour to recal.</L>
<L>A few corrupted by the Persian gold,</L>
<L N="480"><PB N="32" REF="50"/>
Unjust dominion have usurp'd in Thebes.</L>
<L>These in each bosom quell the gen'rous flame</L>
<L>Of liberty. The eloquent they bribe;</L>
<L>With specious tales the multitude they cheat;</L>
<L>And prostitute the name of public good</L>
<L N="485">To veil oppression. Others are immers'd</L>

<L N="490">For consultation, I address'd them thus.</L>
<L>The shortest moment may suffice to know,</L>
<L>If to die free be better than to serve;</L>
<L>But if, deluding Greece by vain delays,</L>
<L>You mean to shew your friendship to the foe,</L>

Approaching with Leonidas. This heard,</L>

<L>Thermopylae is stretch'd. Where broadest spread,</L>
<L>It measures threescore paces, bounded here</L>
<L>By the deep ooze, which underneath presents</L>

An ancient bulwark of the Phocians stands,</L>

<HEAD>LEONIDAS. BOOK II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Leonidas, on his approach to the Isthmus, is met by the leaders of the troops sent from other Grecian states, and by the deputies, who com∣pos'd the Isthmian council. He harangues them, then proceeds in conjunction with the other forces towards Thermopylae; is join'd by Dithyrambus, and arrives at the straits about noon on the fourth day after his departure from the Isthmus. He is receiv'd at Thermopylae by the Thespian commander Demophilus, and by Anax∣ander the Theban treacherously recommending Epialtes a Malian, who seeks by a pompous description of the Persian power to intimidate the Grecian leaders, as they are viewing the enemies camp from the top of mount Oeta. He is answer'd by Dieneces and Diomedon. Xerxes sends Tigranes and Phraortes to the Grecian camp, who are dismiss'd by Leonidas, and conducted back by Dithyrambus and Diomedon; which last, incens'd with the insolence of Tigranes, treats him with contempt and menaces. This occasions a challenge to single combat between Diomedon and Tigranes, Dithyrambus and Phraortes. Epialtes, after a conference with Anaxander, declares his intention of returning to Xerxes.</P>

<L>AURORA spread her purple beams around,</L>
<L>When mov'd the Spartans. Their approach is known.</L>
<L>The Isthmian council, and the various chiefs,</L>
<L>Who led th' auxiliar bands, proceed to meet</L>
<L N="5">Leonidas; Eupalamus the strong,</L>
<L>Alcmaeon, Clonius, Diophantus brave,</L>
<L>And Hegesander. At their head advanc'd</L>
<L>Aristobulus, whom Mycenae's youth</L>
<L>Attend to war; Mycenae once elate</L>
<L N="10">With pow'r and dazzling wealth, and vaunting still</L>
<L>The name of Agamemnon, who along</L>

<L>Unnumber'd sails, and darken'd half the shore</L>
<L>Of trembling Phrygia with the hostile shade.</L>
<L N="15">Aristobulus join'd the Spartan king,</L>
<L>And thus began. Leonidas survey</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="60"/>
Mycenae's race. Should ev'ry other Greek</L>
<L>Be aw'd by Xerxes, and his Asian host,</L>
<L>Believe not, we can fear, deriv'd from those,</L>
<L N="20">Who once conducted o'er the foaming surge</L>
<L>The strength of Greece, who desert left the fields</L>
<L>Of ravag'd Asia, and her proudest walls</L>
<L>From their foundations humbled to the dust.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LEONIDAS replied not, but address'd</L>
<L N="25">The chiefs around. Illustrious warriours hail,</L>
<L>Who thus undaunted signalize your faith,</L>
<L>And gen'rous ardour in the common cause.</L>
<L>But you, whose counsels prop the Grecian state,</L>
<L>O venerable synod, whose decrees</L>
<L N="30">Have call'd us forth, to vanquish, or to die,</L>
<L>Thrice hail. Whate'er by valour we obtain</L>
<L>Your wisdom must preserve. With piercing eyes</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="61"/>
Each Grecian state contemplate, and discern</L>
<L>Their various tempers. Some with partial care</L>
<L N="35">To guard their own neglect the publick weal.</L>
<L>Cold and unmov'd are others. Terrour here,</L>

<L>And join their valour in the gen'ral cause;</L>
<L N="40">Confirm the wav'ring; animate the cold,</L>

<L>Themselves and Greece; their perfidy prevent,</L>
<L>Or call them back to honour. Let us all</L>
<L>Be link'd in sacred union, and the Greeks</L>
<L N="45">Shall stand the world's whole multitude in arms.</L>
<L>If for the spoil, which Paris bore to Troy,</L>
<L>A thousand barks the Hellespont o'erspread;</L>
<L>Shall not again confederated Greece</L>
<L>Be rous'd to battle, and to freedom give,</L>

What once she gave to fame. Behold we haste</L>
<L>To stop th' invading tyrant. Till we bleed,</L>
<L>He shall not pour his millions on your plains.</L>
<L>But as the Gods conceal, how long our strength</L>
<L>May stand unconquer'd, or how soon must fall,</L>
<L N="55">Waste not a moment, till consenting Greece</L>
<L>Range all her free-born numbers in the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LEONIDAS concludes, when awful step'd</L>
<L>Before the sage assembly one, whose head</L>
<L>Was hoar with aged snow, and thus replied.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="60">THY great example ev'ry heart unites.</L>
<L>From thee her happiest omens Greece derives</L>
<L>Of concord, freedom, victory, and fame.</L>
<L>Go then, O first of mortals, and impress</L>
<L>Amaze and terrour in the Persians breast;</L>
<L N="65"><PB N="45" REF="63"/>
The free-born Greeks instructing life to deem</L>
<L>Less dear than virtue, and their country's cause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS heard, Leonidas, thy secret soul</L>
<L>Exulting tasted of the sweet reward</L>
<L N="69">Due to thy name from endless time. His eyes</L>
<L>Once more he turn'd, and view'd in rapt'rous thought</L>
<L>His native land, which he alone can save;</L>
<L>Then summon'd all his majesty, and o'er</L>
<L>The Isthmus trod. Behind the Grecians move</L>
<L>In deep arrangement. So th' imperial bark</L>
<L N="80">With stately bulk along the beating tide</L>
<L>In military pomp conducts the pow'r</L>
<L>Of some proud navy bounding from the port</L>
<L>To bear the vengeance of a mighty state</L>
<L>Against a tyrant's walls. The Grecians march</L>
<L N="85">Till noon, when halting, as they take repast,</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="64"/>
Upon the plain before them they descry</L>
<L>A troop of Thespians. One above the rest</L>
<L>In eminence precedes. His glitt'ring shield,</L>
<L>Whose spacious orb collects th' effulgent beams,</L>
<L N="90">Which from his throne meridian Phoebus cast,</L>
<L>Flames like another sun. A snowy plume</L>
<L>Falls o'er his dazzling cask. In wanton curls,</L>
<L>Which floated in the breathing air, around</L>
<L>The lofty crest it wav'd. Approaching near</L>
<L N="95">Beneath the honours of his radiant helm</L>
<L>The warriour now a countenance display'd,</L>
<L>Where youth in rosy prime with sweetness mix'd</L>
<L>Its manly beauty. With such modest grace</L>
<L>Respectful near Leonidas he came,</L>
<L N="100">As all ideas of his own desert</L>
<L>Were lost in veneration. Phoebus thus</L>
<L>Appears before his everlasting sire,</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="65"/>
When from his altar in th' imbow'ring grove</L>
<L>Of palmy Delos, or the hallow'd bound</L>
<L N="105">Of Tenedos, or Claros, where he hears</L>
<L>His hymns and praises from the sons of men,</L>
<L>He reascends the high Olympian seats;</L>
<L>Such reverential awe his brow invests,</L>
<L>Diffusing o'er the glowing flow'r of youth</L>
<L N="110">New loveliness and grace. The king receives</L>
<L>Th' illustrious Thespian, and began. My tongue</L>
<L>Would call thee Dithyrambus, for thou bear'st</L>

<L>For valour known and virtue. O reveal</L>
<L N="115">Thy birth and charge; whoe'er thou art, my soul</L>
<L>Desires to know thee, and would call thee friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TO whom the youth return'd. O first of Greeks,</L>
<L>My name is Dithyrambus, which the lips</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="66"/>
Of some benevolent and gen'rous friend</L>
<L N="120">To thee have sounded with a partial voice,</L>
<L>And thou hast heard with favourable ears.</L>
<L>I come deputed by the Thespian chief,</L>
<L>The Theban, and the Locrian, and the brave</L>
<L>Diomedon, to hasten thy approach.</L>
<L N="125">Three days will bring the Persian pow'rs in view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE ceas'd. At once the standards are uprear'd.</L>
<L>The host till ev'ning with impetuous pace</L>
<L>Their march continue. Through the earliest dews</L>
<L>Of morning they proceed, and reach the pass,</L>
<L N="130">E'er the fourth sun attain'd the sult'ry noon.</L>
<L>To their impatient sight no sooner rose</L>
<L>The rocks of Oeta, but with rapid feet,</L>
<L>And martial sounds of joy they rush'd along;</L>
<L>As if the present deity of Fame,</L>
<L N="135"><PB N="49" REF="67"/>
Her temples with unfading laurels bound,</L>
<L>And in her hand her adamantine trump,</L>
<L>Had from the hills her radiant form disclos'd,</L>

<L>That she their acts beholding might resound</L>
<L N="140">Their name and glory o'er the earth and seas.</L>
<L>Before the van Leonidas advanc'd,</L>

<L>ALL hail! Thermopylae, and you, the pow'rs,</L>

<L>Ye fountain nymphs, who pour your lucid rills</L>

Untrod by human feet, and trac'd alone</L>
<L>By your immortal footsteps. O defend</L>

<L>Profane the solemn silence of your groves.</L>
<L N="155">Thus on your hills your praises shall you hear</L>
<L>From those, whose deeds shall tell th' approving world,</L>
<L>That not to undeservers did you grant</L>
<L>Your high protection. You my valiant friends</L>
<L>Now rouse the gen'rous spirit, which inflames</L>
<L N="160">Your breasts; now prove the vigour of your arms:</L>
<L>That your recorded actions may survive</L>
<L>Within the breasts of all the brave and free,</L>

<L>As in some torrid region, where the head</L>

<L>In rapid torrents of involving flames</L>
<L>Sweeps o'er the crackling plain, and mounting high</L>
<L>In ruddy spires illumines half the skies:</L>
<L N="175">Not with less swiftness through the glowing ranks</L>
<L>The words of great Leonidas diffus'd</L>

<L>The patriot's virtue, and the soldier's fire,</L>
<L N="180">When danger in its most tremendous form</L>

</LG>
<LG>

<L>Were station'd near Thermopylae, accost</L>
<L>The Spartan king. The Thespian chief allied</L>

That Anaxander from his native gates</L>
<L>Here hath not borne a solitary spear,</L>
<L>Nor these inglorious in their walls remain'd.</L>
<L>But longer do we loiter? Haste my friends</L>
<L>To yonder cliff, which points its shade afar,</L>
<L N="220">And view the Persian camp. The morning sun</L>

<L>Lo! here a Malian, Epialtes nam'd,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE said. His seeming virtue all deceiv'd.</L>
<L N="225">The camp not long had Epialtes join'd,</L>
<L>By race a Malian. Eloquent his tongue,</L>
<L>But false his heart, and abject. He was skill'd</L>
<L>To grace perfidious counsels, and to cloath</L>

Himself a Greek, a faithless spy he came.</L>
<L>Soon to the friends of Xerxes he repair'd,</L>
<L>The Theban chiefs, and nightly consult held,</L>
<L>How best with consternation to deject</L>
<L N="235">The Spartan valour, or how best betray.</L>
<L>With him the leaders climb the arduous hill,</L>
<L>From whence the dreadful prospect they command,</L>
<L>Where endless plains by white pavilions hid</L>
<L>Spread, like the vast Atlantic, when no shore,</L>

<L>Unbounded, as it wanders; but the moon</L>
<L>Resplendent eye of night in fullest orb</L>
<L>Throughout th' interminated surface throws</L>
<L>Its rays abroad, and decks in snowy light</L>
<L N="245">The dancing billows; such was Xerxes' camp:</L>
<L>A pow'r unrivall'd by the greatest king,</L>

Dissolving all the sacred ties, which bind</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Tigranes and Phraortes repair to Xerxes, whom they find seated on a throne surrounded by his satraps in a magnificent pavilion; while the Magi stand before him, and sing an hymn containing the religion of Zoroastres. Xerxes, notwithstanding the arguments of his brothers Hyperanthes and Abrocomes, gives no credit to the ambassadors, who report, that the Grecians are determin'd to maintain the pass against him; but commands Demaratus an exil'd king of Sparta to attend him, and ascends his chariot to take a view of the Grecians himself. He passes through the midst of his army, consisting of many nations differing in arms, customs, and manners. He advances to the entrance of the straits, and surpris'd at the behaviour of the Spar∣tans demands the reason of it from Demaratus; which occasions a conversation between them on the mercenary forces of Persia, and the militia of Greece. Demaratus weeping at the fight of his country∣men, is comforted by Hyperanthes. Xerxes still incredulous commands Tigranes and Phraortes to bring the Grecians bound before him the next day, and retires to his pavilion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<PB N="72" REF="90"/>
<L>NOW had Tigranes, and Phraortes gain'd</L>
<L>The splendid tent of Xerxes. Him they found</L>
<L>Begirt with princes, and illustrious chiefs,</L>
<L>The potentates of Asia. Near his side</L>
<L N="5">His valiant brothers stood, Abrocomes,</L>
<L>And Hyperanthes, then Pharnuchus brave,</L>
<L>Pandates, Intaphernes, mighty lords,</L>
<L>And numbers more in purple splendour clad,</L>
<L>With homage all attending round the throne,</L>
<L N="10">Whose gorgeous seat erected high upbore</L>
<L>Their regal master. He above their heads</L>
<L>Look'd down imperious. So the stately tow'r</L>
<L>Of Belus, mingling its majestick front</L>
<L>With heav'n's bright azure, from on high survey'd</L>
<L N="15">The huge extent of Babylon, with all</L>
<L>Its sumptuous domes and palaces beneath.</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="91"/>
That day the monarch deem'd to enter Greece,</L>
<L>And hide her fields with war; but first ordains,</L>
<L>That grateful hymns should celebrate the name</L>
<L N="20">Of Oromasdes: so the Persians call'd</L>
<L>The world's great author. By the king's decree</L>
<L>The Magi stood before th' unfolded tent.</L>
<L>Fire blaz'd beside them. Tow'rds the sacred flame</L>
<L>They turn'd, and sent their tuneful praise to heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="25">FROM Zoroastres was the song deriv'd,</L>
<L>Who on the hills of Persia from his cave</L>
<L>With flow'rs incircled, and with murm'ring founts,</L>
<L>That chear'd the solemn mansion, had reveal'd,</L>
<L>How Oromasdes, radiant source of good,</L>
<L N="30">Original, immortal fram'd the globe</L>
<L>With all its varied beauty: how with stars</L>
<L>By him the heav'ns were spangled: how the sun,</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="92"/>
Refulgent Mithra, purest spring of light,</L>
<L>And genial warmth, whence fruitful Nature smiles,</L>
<L N="35">Burst from the east at his creating voice;</L>
<L>When streight beyond the golden verge of day</L>
<L>Night shew'd the horrours of her distant reign,</L>
<L>Whence black, and hateful Arimanius sprung,</L>
<L>The author foul of evil: he with shades</L>
<L N="40">From his dire mansion veil'd the earth and skies,</L>
<L>Or to destruction chang'd the solar beam,</L>
<L>When parching fields deny the foodful grain,</L>
<L>And from their channels fly th' exhaling streams,</L>
<L>Whence pestilence, and famine: how the pow'r</L>
<L N="45">Of Oromasdes in the human breast</L>
<L>Benevolence, and equity infus'd,</L>
<L>Truth, temperance, and wisdom sprung from heav'n;</L>
<L>When Arimanius blacken'd all the soul</L>
<L>With falshood, and injustice, with desires</L>
<L N="50"><PB N="75" REF="93"/>
Insatiable, with violence, and rage,</L>
<L>Malignity, and folly. If the hand</L>
<L>Of Oromasdes on precarious life</L>
<L>Shed wealth, and pleasure, soon th' infernal God</L>
<L>With wild excess, or av'rice blasts the joy.</L>
<L N="55">Thou, Oromasdes, victory dost give.</L>
<L>By thee with fame the regal head is crown'd.</L>
<L>Great Xerxes owns thy succour. When with storms</L>
<L>The hate of direful Arimanius swell'd</L>
<L>The Hellespont, thou o'er the angry surge</L>
<L N="60">The destin'd master of the world didst lead,</L>
<L>This day his promis'd glories to enjoy,</L>
<L>When Greece affrighted to his arm shall bend;</L>
<L>Ev'n as at last shall Arimanius fall</L>
<L>Before thy might, and evil be no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="65">THE Magi ceas'd their harmony; when now</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="94"/>
Before the king with adoration bow'd</L>
<L>Tigranes and Phraortes. Prone they lay,</L>
<L>And o'er their foreheads spread their abject hands,</L>
<L>As from a present deity too bright</L>
<L N="70">For mortal vision to conceal their eyes.</L>
<L>At length in humble phrase Tigranes thus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O XERXES, live for ever! Gracious lord!</L>
<L>Who dost permit thy servants to approach</L>
<L>Thy awful sight, and prostrate thus to own</L>
<L N="75">Thy majesty and greatness. May the pow'r</L>
<L>Of Oromasdes stretch thy scepter'd arm</L>
<L>O'er all the nations from the Indian shores,</L>
<L>Ev'n to the waters of the western main,</L>
<L>From northern Tanais to the source of Nile!</L>
<L N="80">And still from thee may Arimanius turn</L>
<L>Against thy foes his malice to mankind!</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="95"/>
By him, ev'n now with frenzy smote, the Greeks</L>
<L>Reject thy proffer'd clemency. The morn</L>
<L>Shall see them bleed the victims of thy wrath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="85">HERE, to his brothers turning, Xerxes spake.</L>
<L>Say, Hyperanthes? Does thy soul believe</L>
<L>These tydings? Sure these slaves have never dar'd</L>
<L>To face the Grecians, but delude our ear</L>
<L>With base impostures, which their fears suggest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="90">To him this answer Hyperanthes form'd.</L>
<L>O from his servants may the king avert</L>
<L>His indignation! Greece was fam'd of old</L>
<L>For martial virtue, and intrepid sons:</L>
<L>I have essay'd their valour, and with me</L>
<L N="95">Abrocomes can witness. When our sire</L>
<L>The great Darius to th' Athenian shore</L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="96"/>
With Artaphernes, and with Datis sent</L>
<L>Our tender youth; at Marathon we found,</L>
<L>How vain the hopes, that numbers should dismay</L>
<L N="100">A foe resolv'd on victory, or death.</L>
<L>Yet not as one contemptible, or base</L>
<L>Let me appear before thee: though the Greeks</L>
<L>With such unconquer'd spirits be indu'd,</L>
<L>Soon as the king shall summon me to war,</L>
<L N="105">He shall behold me in the dang'rous van</L>
<L>Exalt my spear, and pierce the hostile ranks,</L>
<L>Or sink before them. Xerxes then return'd;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHY over Asia, and the Libyan soil,</L>
<L>With all their nations does my potent arm</L>
<L N="110">Extend its scepter? Wherefore do I sweep</L>
<L>Across the globe with millions in my train?</L>
<L>Why shade the Ocean with unnumber'd sails?</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="97"/>
Whence all this pow'r, unless th' eternal will</L>
<L>Had doom'd to give one master to the world,</L>
<L N="115">And that the earth's extremity alone</L>
<L>Should bound my empire? He for this reduc'd</L>
<L>Revolted Aegypt, and inlarg'd my sway</L>
<L>With sandy Libya, and the sultry clime</L>
<L>Of Aethiopia. He for this subdu'd</L>
<L N="120">The Hellespontic rage, and taught the sea</L>
<L>Obedience to my pow'r. Then cease to think,</L>
<L>That heav'n deserting now the cause of kings</L>
<L>Those despicable Grecians will inspire</L>
<L>With courage more than human, and expunge</L>
<L N="125">The common fears of nature from their breasts.</L>
<L>He ceas'd, when thus Abrocomes began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE king commands us to reveal our hearts:</L>
<L>Then may the sun to lightning change his beams</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="98"/>
And blast my head with ruin; may the king</L>
<L N="130">Look on his servant with a loathing eye,</L>
<L>If what I here affirm be false, or vain,</L>
<L>That yonder Grecians will oppose our course.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE king arose. No more: prepare my Car;</L>
<L>The Spartan exile Demaratus call:</L>
<L N="135">We will our selves advance and view the foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE monarch will'd; and suddenly he hears</L>
<L>His trampling horses. High on silver wheels</L>
<L>The iv'ry car with azure sapphirs shone,</L>
<L>Caerulean beryls, and the jasper green,</L>
<L N="140">The emerald, the ruby's glowing blush,</L>
<L>The flaming topaz with its golden beam,</L>
<L>The pearl, th' impurpled amathyst, and all</L>
<L>The various gems, which India's mines afford</L>
<L>To deck the pomp of kings. In burnish'd gold</L>
<L N="145"><PB N="81" REF="99"/>
A sculptur'd eagle from behind displays</L>
<L>Its stately neck, and o'er the monarch's head</L>
<L>Extends its dazzling wings. Eight gen'rous steeds,</L>
<L>Which on the fam'd Nysaean plain were nurs'd</L>
<L>In wintry Media, drew the radiant car.</L>
<L N="150">Not those of old to Hercules refus'd</L>
<L>By false Laomedon, nor they, which bore</L>
<L>The son of Thetis through the scatter'd rear</L>
<L>Of Troy's devoted race, might these surpass</L>
<L>In strength, or beauty. With obedient pride</L>
<L N="155">They heard their lord: exulting in the air</L>
<L>They toss'd their foreheads, while the silver manes</L>
<L>Smote on their glitt'ring necks. The king ascends:</L>
<L>Beside his footstool Demaratus sat.</L>
<L>The charioteer now shakes the golden reins,</L>
<L N="160">Bold Patiramphes. At the signal bound</L>
<L>Th' attentive steeds; the chariot flew; behind</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="100"/>
Ten thousand horse in thunder swept the field.</L>
<L>The eastern bands (so Xerxes had ordain'd)</L>
<L>Between the sea-beat margin, and the camp</L>
<L N="165">All wait imbattled, all prepar'd to pass</L>
<L>Thermopylae. To these with rapid wheels</L>
<L>Th' imperial car proceeds. Th' approaching king</L>
<L>Soon through the wide battalions is proclaim'd.</L>
<L>He now draws nigh. Th' innumerable host</L>
<L N="170">Roll back by nations, and admit their lord</L>
<L>With all his satraps. From his crystal dome</L>
<L>Rais'd on the bottom of the watry world</L>
<L>Thus when the potent ruler of the floods</L>
<L>With each caerulean deity ascends,</L>
<L N="175">Thron'd on his pearly chariot; all the deep</L>
<L>Divides its bosom to th' emerging God.</L>
<L>So Xerxes rode between the Asian world</L>
<L>On either side receding; when, as down</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="101"/>
Th' immeasurable ranks his sight was lost,</L>
<L N="180">A momentary gloom o'ercast his mind,</L>
<L>While this reflection fill'd his eyes with tears:</L>
<L>That soon, as Time an hundred years had told,</L>
<L>Not one of all those thousands should survive.</L>
<L>Whence to obscure thy pride arose that cloud?</L>
<L N="185">Was it, that once humanity could touch</L>
<L>A tyrant's breast? or rather did thy soul</L>
<L>Repine, O Xerxes, at the bitter thought,</L>
<L>That all thy pow'r was mortal? But the veil</L>
<L>Of sadness soon forsook his brightning eyes,</L>
<L N="190">As with adoring homage millions bow'd,</L>
<L>And to his heart relentless pride recall'd.</L>
<L>Elate the mingled prospect he surveys</L>
<L>Of glitt'ring files unnumber'd, chariots scyth'd</L>
<L>On thund'ring axles roll'd with haughty steeds</L>
<L N="195">In sumptuous trappings clad (Barbaric pomp)</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="102"/>
Which tore with spurning hoofs the sandy beach;</L>
<L>While ev'ry banner to the sun expands</L>
<L>Its gorgeous folds, that beam'd with gold, with shields,</L>
<L>Tiaras, helms environ'd, and with spears</L>
<L N="200">In number equal to the bladed grass,</L>
<L>Whose living green in vernal beauty cloaths</L>
<L>Thessalia's vale. What pow'rs of sounding verse</L>
<L>Can to the mind present th' amazing scene?</L>
<L>Not thee, whom Rumour's fabling voice delights,</L>
<L N="205">Poetic Fancy, to my aid I call;</L>
<L>But thou, historic Truth, support my song,</L>
<L>Which shall the various multitude display,</L>
<L>Their arms, their manners, and their native seats.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Persians first in scaly corselets shone</L>
<L N="210">With colours varying on the gorgeous sleeves,</L>
<L>A gen'rous nation. From their infant age</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="103"/>
Their tongues were practic'd in the love of truth,</L>
<L>Their limbs inur'd to ev'ry manly toil,</L>
<L>To brace the bow, to rule th' impetuous steed,</L>
<L N="215">And dart the javelin; worthy to enjoy</L>
<L>The liberty, their injur'd fathers lost,</L>
<L>Whose arms for Cyrus overturn'd the strength</L>
<L>Of Babylon and Sardis, and advanc'd</L>
<L>The victors head above his country's laws.</L>
<L N="220">Such were the Persians; but untaught to form</L>
<L>The ranks of battle, with unequal force</L>
<L>Against the phalanx of the Greeks they stood,</L>
<L>And to the massy shield, and weighty spear</L>
<L>A target light, and slender lance oppos'd.</L>
<L N="225">On ev'ry head tiaras rose, like tow'rs,</L>
<L>Impenetrable. All with burnish'd gold</L>
<L>Blaz'd their gay sandals, and the floating reins</L>
<L>Of each proud courser. Daggers from their thighs,</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="104"/>
A well-stor'd quiver from their shoulders hung,</L>
<L N="230">And strongest bows of mighty size they bore.</L>
<L>Next, with resembling arms the Medes are seen,</L>
<L>The Cissians, and Hyrcanians. Media once</L>
<L>From her bleak mountains aw'd the subject East.</L>
<L>Her kings in cold Ecbatana were thron'd.</L>
<L N="235">The Cissians march'd from Susa's regal walls,</L>
<L>From sultry fields o'erspread with branching palms,</L>
<L>And white with lillies, water'd by the tides</L>
<L>Of fam'd Choaspes, whose transparent waves</L>
<L>The golden goblet wafts to Persia's kings.</L>
<L N="240">No other stream the royal lip bedews.</L>
<L>Hyrcania's race forsook their fruitful clime</L>
<L>Dark with the verdure of expanding oaks,</L>
<L>To Ceres dear and Bacchus. There the corn</L>
<L>Bent by its golden burthen sheds unreap'd</L>
<L N="245">Its plenteous seed impregnating the soil</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="105"/>
With future harvests; while the bees reside</L>
<L>Among th' intwining branches of the groves,</L>
<L>Where with their labours they enrich the leaves,</L>
<L>Which flow with sweetness. Next, Assyria's sons</L>
<L N="250">Their brazen helms display, th'unskilful work</L>
<L>Of rude Barbarians. Thick-wove flax defends</L>
<L>Their chest and loins. A buckler guards their arm.</L>
<L>Girt with a falchion each a mace sustains</L>
<L>O'erlaid with iron. On Euphrates' banks</L>
<L N="255">In Babylon's stupendous walls they dwell,</L>
<L>And o'er the plains, where once with mightier tow'rs</L>
<L>Old Ninus rear'd its head, th' imperial seat</L>
<L>Of eldest tyrants. These Chaldaea joins,</L>
<L>The land of shepherds. On the pastures wide</L>
<L N="260">There Belus first discern'd the various course</L>
<L>Of heav'n's bright planets, and the clust'ring stars</L>
<L>With names distinguish'd, whence himself was deem'd</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="106"/>
The chief of Gods. His heav'n-ascending fane</L>
<L>In Babylon the proud Assyrians rais'd.</L>
<L N="265">Drawn from the fertile soil, which Ochus laves,</L>
<L>The Bactrians stood, like Persia's bands attir'd,</L>
<L>Though less their javelins, and their bows of cane;</L>
<L>The Paricanians next all rough with hides</L>
<L>Of shaggy goats, with bows and daggers arm'd.</L>
<L N="270">Alike in horrid garb the Caspian train</L>
<L>From barren mountains, and the dreary coast,</L>
<L>Which bounds the stormy lake, that bears their name,</L>
<L>With cany bows, and scymetars were led.</L>
<L>The Indians then a threefold band appear'd.</L>
<L N="275">Part guide the horse, and part the rapid car;</L>
<L>The rest on foot within the bending cane</L>
<L>For slaughter held their iron-pointed reeds.</L>
<L>These o'er the Indus from the distant floods</L>
<L>Of Ganges pass'd, and left a region lov'd</L>
<L N="280"><PB N="89" REF="107"/>
By lavish Nature. There the plenteous year</L>
<L>Twice crown'd with harvests smiles. The honey'd shrub,</L>
<L>The cinnamon, and spikenard bless their fields.</L>
<L>Array'd in native wealth the warriours shone.</L>
<L>Their ears were grac'd with pendants, and their hands</L>
<L N="285">Incircled wore a bracelet starr'd with gems.</L>
<L>These were the nations, who to Xerxes sent</L>
<L>Their mingled aids of infantry and horse.</L>

<L>A bow, a falchion, and a pond'rous ax</L>
<L>The savage legions arm'd. A pointed cask</L>

Or with the spoil from tawny lions torn,</L>

<L>These friends of hospitality and peace,</L>

With ev'ry art of eloquence divine</L>

<P>Leonidas rising by break of day commands a body of Arcadians, with the Thespians, and Plataeans to be drawn out for battle in that part of Thermopylae, which lay under the Phocian wall, from whence he harangues them. The enemy approaches. Diomedon kills Tigranes in single combat. Both armies join battle. Dithyrambus kills Phraortes. The Persians, entirely defeated, are pursued with great slaughter by Diomedon and Dithyrambus to the extremity of the pass. The Grecian commanders, after the pursuit retire for refreshment to a cave in the side of mount Oeta. Leonidas recals them to the camp, and sends down fresh forces. Diomedon, and Dithyrambus, with the Plataeans are permitted to continue in the field. By the advice of Diomedon the Grecians advance to the broadest part of Thermo∣pylae, where they form a line of thirty in depth, consisting of the Plataeans, Mantinéans, Tegaeans, Thebans, Corinthians, Phliasians, and Mycenaeans. The attack is renew'd with great violence by Hy∣peranthes, Abrocomes, and the principal Persian leaders at the head of some chosen troops.</P>

<HEAD>LEONIDAS. BOOK V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Hyperanthes discontinuing the fight, while he waits for reinforce∣ments, Teribazus, a Persian remarkable for his merit and learning, and highly belov'd by Hyperanthes, but unhappy in his passion for Ariana, a daughter of Darius, advances from the rest of the army to the rescue of a friend in distress, who lay wounded on the field of battle. Teribazus, is attack'd by Diophantus, the Mantinéan, whom he overcomes, then engaging with Dithyrambus, is himself slain. Hype∣ranthes hastens to his succour. A general battle ensues. Hyperanthes and Abrocomes, partly by their own valour, and partly by the perfidy of the Thebans, who desert the line, being on the point of forcing the Grecians, are repuls'd by the Lacedaemonians. Hyperanthes composes a select body out of the Persian standing forces, and making an im∣provement in their discipline renews the attack; upon which Leonidas changes the disposition of his army: Hyperanthes and the ablest Persian generals are driven out of the field, and several thousands of the Barbarians, circumvented in the pass, are entirely destroy'd.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<PB N="154" REF="172"/>
<L>AMID the van of Persia was a youth</L>
<L>Nam'd Teribazus, not for golden stores,</L>
<L>Not for wide pastures travers'd o'er with herds,</L>
<L>With bleating thousands, or with bounding steeds,</L>
<L N="5">Nor yet for pow'r, nor splendid honours fam'd.</L>
<L>Rich was his mind in ev'ry art divine,</L>
<L>And through the paths of science had he walk'd</L>
<L>The votary of wisdom. In the years,</L>
<L>When tender down invests the ruddy cheek,</L>
<L N="10">He with the Magi turn'd the hallow'd page</L>
<L>Of Zoroastres; then his tow'ring soul</L>
<L>High on the plumes of contemplation soar'd,</L>
<L>And from the lofty Babylonian fane</L>
<L>With learn'd Chaldaeans trac'd the mystic sphere;</L>
<L N="15">There number'd o'er the vivid fires, that gleam</L>
<L>Upon the dusky bosom of the night.</L>
<L><PB N="155" REF="173"/>
Nor on the sands of Ganges were unheard</L>
<L>The Indian sages, from sequester'd bow'rs</L>
<L>While, as attention wonder'd, they disclos'd</L>
<L N="20">The pow'rs of nature; whether in the woods,</L>
<L>The fruitful glebe, or flow'r, or healing plant,</L>
<L>The limpid waters, or the ambient air,</L>
<L>Or in the purer element of fire.</L>
<L>The fertile plains, where great Sesostris reign'd,</L>
<L N="25">Mysterious Aegypt next the youth survey'd,</L>
<L>From Elephantis, where impetuous Nile</L>
<L>Precipitates his waters, to the sea,</L>
<L>Which far below receives the sev'nfold stream.</L>
<L>Thence o'er th' Ionic coast he stray'd, nor pass'd</L>
<L N="30">Milétus by, which once inraptur'd heard</L>
<L>The tongue of Thales, nor Priene's walls,</L>
<L>Where Wisdom dwelt with Bias, nor the seat</L>
<L>Of Pittacus along the Lesbian shore.</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="174"/>
Here too melodious numbers charm'd his ear,</L>
<L N="35">Which flow'd from Orpheus, and Musaeus old,</L>
<L>And thee, O father of immortal verse,</L>
<L>Maeonides, whose strains through ev'ry age</L>
<L>Time with his own eternal lip shall sing.</L>
<L>Back to his native Susa then he turn'd</L>
<L N="40">His wandring steps. His merit soon was dear</L>
<L>To Hyperanthes generous and good.</L>
<L>And Ariana from Darius sprung</L>
<L>With Hyperanthes, of th' imperial race,</L>
<L>Which rul'd th' extent of Asia, in disdain</L>
<L N="45">Of all her greatness oft an humble ear</L>
<L>To him would bend, and listen to his voice.</L>
<L>Her charms, her mind, her virtue he explor'd</L>
<L>Admiring. Soon was admiration chang'd</L>
<L>To love, nor lov'd he sooner, than despair'd.</L>
<L N="50">But unreveal'd and silent was his pain;</L>
<L><PB N="157" REF="175"/>
Nor yet in solitary shades he roam'd,</L>
<L>Nor shun'd resort: but o'er his sorrows cast</L>
<L>A sickly dawn of gladness, and in smiles</L>
<L>Conceal'd his anguish; while the secret flame</L>
<L N="55">Rag'd in his bosom, and its peace consum'd:</L>
<L>His heart still brooding o'er these mournful thoughts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>CAN I, O wisdom, seek relief from thee,</L>
<L>Who dost approve my passion? From the pow'r</L>
<L>Of beauty only thou wouldst guard my heart.</L>
<L N="60">But here thyself art charm'd, where softness, grace,</L>
<L>And ev'ry virtue dignify desire;</L>
<L>Yet thus to love despairing is to prove</L>
<L>The sharpest sorrow, which relentless Fate</L>
<L>Can from her store of woes inflict on life:</L>
<L N="65">But dost not thou this moment warn my soul</L>
<L>To fly the fatal charmer? Do I pause?</L>
<L><PB N="158" REF="176"/>
Back to the wise Chaldaeans will I go,</L>
<L>Or wander on the Ganges; where to heav'n</L>
<L>With thee my elevated soul shall tow'r,</L>
<L N="70">With thee the secrets of the earth unveil.</L>
<L>There no tumultuous passion shall molest</L>
<L>My tranquil hours, and ev'ry thought be calm.</L>
<L>O wretched Teribazus! all conspires</L>
<L>Against thy peace. Our mighty lord prepares</L>
<L N="75">To overwhelm the Grecians. Ev'ry youth</L>
<L>Attends the war, and I, who late have poiz'd</L>
<L>With no inglorious arm the soldier's lance,</L>
<L>And near the side of Hyperanthes fought,</L>
<L>Must join the throng. How therefore can I fly</L>
<L N="80">From Ariana! who with Asia's queens</L>
<L>The splendid camp of Xerxes will adorn.</L>
<L>Then be it so. Again I will adore</L>
<L>Her gentle virtue. Her delightful tongue,</L>
<L><PB N="159" REF="177"/>
Her graceful sweetness shall again diffuse</L>
<L N="85">Resistless magic through my ravish'd heart;</L>
<L>And thus when love with double rage inflam'd</L>
<L>Swells to distraction in my tortur'd breast,</L>
<L>Then—But in vain through darkness do I search</L>
<L>My fate: despair and fortune be my guides.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="90">THE hour arriv'd, when Xerxes first advanc'd</L>
<L>His arms from Susa's gates. The Persian dames</L>
<L>(So were accustom'd all the eastern fair)</L>
<L>In sumptuous cars accompanied his march;</L>
<L>And Ariana grac'd the beauteous train.</L>
<L N="95">From morn till ev'ning Teribazus guards</L>
<L>Her passing wheels; his arm her weight sustains</L>
<L>With trembling pleasure often, as she mounts</L>
<L>Th' imperial chariot; his assiduous hand</L>
<L>From each pure fountain wafts the living flood:</L>
<L N="100"><PB N="160" REF="178"/>
Nor seldom by the fair-one's soft command</L>
<L>Would he repose him at her feet reclin'd,</L>
<L>While o'er his lips her lovely forehead bow'd</L>
<L>Won with his grateful eloquence, that sooth'd</L>
<L>With sweet variety the tedious march,</L>
<L N="105">Beguiling time. He too would then forget</L>
<L>His cares awhile, in raptures vain intranc'd,</L>
<L>Delusion all, and fleeting rays of joy</L>
<L>Soon overcast with more intense despair;</L>
<L>Like wintry clouds, which op'ning for a time</L>
<L N="110">Tinge their black skirts with scatter'd beams of day;</L>
<L>Then swiftly closing, on the brows of Morn</L>
<L>Condense their horrours, and in thickest gloom</L>
<L>The ruddy beauty veil. Such woes oppress'd</L>
<L>The Persian's heart, not soften'd; for this day</L>
<L N="115">His daring valour from the bleeding van</L>
<L>Oppos'd the frown of adamantine Mars.</L>
<L><PB N="161" REF="179"/>
With no tiara were his temples bound,</L>
<L>The slender lance of Asia he disdain'd,</L>

<L>Down to the knees his ample shield was spread.</L>
<L N="125">A pond'rous ash with skillful hands he grasp'd.</L>
<L>Thus arm'd, tremendous in the front he stood.</L>

<L>Recall'd his fainting legions. Now each band</L>

<L><PB N="162" REF="180"/>
Meantime with Teribazus thus confer'd</L>

<L>STILL do I languish mourning o'er the fame,</L>

<L>My undeserving hand, who knows, but she</L>

I stand this moment on the verge of life,</L>
<L>By fame invited, by despair impell'd</L>
<L N="200">To pass th' irremeable bound. No more</L>

Thou deign'st to meet, receive my thanks; and know,</L>
<L>The thought of conquest less employs my mind,</L>
<L N="215">Than that by thee I cannot fall with shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE ceas'd. These words the Thespian chief return'd.</L>
<L>Of all the praises from thy gen'rous mouth</L>
<L>The only share, which justice bids me claim,</L>
<L>Is, that I here adventure to confront</L>
<L N="220">Thy matchless strength. Believe not, that unmark'd</L>
<L>Were thy great deeds. From you unbounded camp</L>

<L>But whence thy armour of the Grecian form?</L>
<L>Whence thy tall spear? thy helmet? whence the weight</L>

<L>O if thou be'st some fugitive, who, lost</L>
<L>To liberty and virtue, art become</L>
<L>A tyrant's vile stipendiary; with grief</L>
<L><PB N="168" REF="186"/>
That valour, thus triumphant, I behold,</L>

<LG>
<L>HERE Teribazus with a sigh return'd.</L>
<L>I am to Greece a stranger, and a wretch</L>
<L>To thee unknown, who seek, this hour, to die;</L>
<L N="235">Though not ignobly, but in death to raise</L>
<L>My name from darkness, while I end my woes.</L>

<LG>
<L>THE Grecian then. I view thee, and I mourn.</L>
<L>A dignity, which virtue only bears,</L>
<L>And resolution on thy brow enthron'd</L>
<L>(Though grief hath dim'd thy drooping eye) demand</L>
<L N="241">My veneration; and whatever be</L>
<L>The malice of thy fortune, what the cares,</L>
<L>Which thus infest thy quiet, they create</L>
<L><PB N="169" REF="187"/>
Within my breast the pity of a friend:</L>
<L N="245">Why hast thou then compell'd me to oppose</L>
<L>My arm against thee, while thy might supports</L>
<L>Th' unjust ambition of malignant kings,</L>
<L>The foes to virtue, liberty, and peace?</L>
<L>Yet free from rage, or enmity I lift</L>
<L N="250">My adverse javelin. Victory I ask,</L>
<L>Thy life may fate for happier hours reserve.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS said, their beaming lances they protend,</L>
<L>Of hostile hate, or fury both devoid;</L>
<L>As on the Isthmian, or Olympic sand</L>
<L N="255">For fame alone contending. Either host</L>

Against the Persian target, shiv'ring breaks,</L>
<L>Its master's hand disarming. Then began▪</L>
<L>The sense of honour, and the dread of shame</L>
<L>To swell in Dithyrambus. Undismay'd</L>
<L>He grapples with the foe, and instant seiz'd</L>
<L N="265">The threatning javelin, e'er th'uplifted arm</L>

<L>On ev'ry side they traverse, now direct,</L>

<L>Still is the conflict dubious, when the Greek</L>

<L N="275">His arm depress'd, as overcome with toil;</L>
<L>While with his buckler cautious he repels</L>
<L><PB N="171" REF="189"/>
The blows repeated from th' exulting foe.</L>
<L>Greece trembles for her hero. Joy pervades</L>
<L>The Asian ranks, and Hyperanthes strides</L>
<L N="280">Before the line, preparing to receive</L>
<L>His friend triumphant. Teribazus now</L>
<L>Press'd with redoubled efforts. Still the Greek</L>
<L>Sustains th' assault defensive, and at last,</L>

<L>Affection, grief, and terrour wing the speed</L>
<L N="290">Of Hyperanthes. From his bleeding foe</L>
<L>The Greek retires, not distant, and awaits</L>
<L>The eastern prince. But he with wat'ry cheeks,</L>
<L>And dumb with sorrow clasps his dying friend,</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="190"/>
From whose cold lip with interrupted phrase</L>
<L N="295">These accents broke. O dearest, best of men!</L>
<L>My heart is fruitful with ten thousand thoughts</L>

<L>Denies my voice the utt'rance. O my friend!</L>

<L>What thou shouldst ne'er have known before this hour;</L>
<L N="301">When, as I open all my secret soul,</L>
<L>I may at once retire, and veil my eyes</L>
<L>In endless night: nor thou presumption deem</L>
<L>What with my dying breath I here divulge.</L>
<L N="305">I love thy sister. With despair I lov'd,</L>
<L>And thence perhaps untimely is my date;</L>
<L>Though, witness heav'n, without regret I bleed</L>
<L>With honour thus in Persia's sight and thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="173" REF="191"/>
<L>HE ceas'd: th' inexorable hand of Fate</L>
<L N="310">Weigh'd down his eyelids, and the gloom of death</L>
<L>His fleeting sight eternally o'ershades.</L>
<L>Him on Choaspes o'er the blooming verge</L>

<L>OH! Teribazus. Oh! my friend, whose loss</L>

Thy friendly aspect shall delight my eyes,</L>

<LG>
<L>HE said, and ardent rushes on the Greek,</L>
<L N="335">Who, while his noble enemy expir'd,</L>
<L>And Hyperanthes snatch'd with tender arms</L>
<L>The last embraces from his gasping friend,</L>
<L>Stood near reclin'd in sadness o'er his shield,</L>

Nor mark'd his threatning foe: when swift approach'd</L>

<L>Of Hyperanthes pour'd with all their bands</L>
<L N="350">Betwixt th' encountring chiefs. With mutual wrath</L>
<L>They strove in vain the combat to renew.</L>
<L>So rage two bulls upon th' opposing banks</L>
<L>Of some deep flood, which parts the fruitful mead;</L>
<L><PB N="176" REF="194"/>
Defiance thunders from their angry mouths</L>
<L N="355">In vain; in vain the furrow'd earth they rend:</L>
<L>Wide rolls the stream, and intercepts the war.</L>
<L>The fierce Plataean satiates his revenge</L>
<L>On vulgar lives. Before his dreaded arm</L>
<L>Whole ranks are scatter'd. But the Persian prince</L>
<L N="360">Borne down the stress of battle gains the shore,</L>
<L>Where then the brave Abrocomes advanc'd;</L>
<L>With him Orontes and Pharnuchus stood,</L>
<L>Mazaeus, Abradates fam'd in arms,</L>
<L>And all the boldest of the eastern chiefs</L>
<L N="365">Begirt with fresh battalions: here with speed</L>

</LG>

<L>TO Intaphernes is Pandates sent</L>

And these unite thy valour. Here the flow'r</L>

<L>The dang'rous van. He heads the splendid throng</L>

<L>Themselves the lords of nations, who before</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L N="380">WHO first distain'd with Persian blood his sword?</L>
<L>Eupalamus. Artembares he slew</L>

<L>None could Mycenae boast of prouder birth</L>
<L N="390">Than young Melissus; blooming, as the son</L>

<L>A storm of fury darkens all his brow.</L>
<L N="400">Around he rolls his gloomy eye, and marks</L>
<L>Achaemenes for death, of regal blood</L>
<L>Deriv'd from Croesus, once th' imperial lord</L>

Of nations; him the nymphs of Halys wept,</L>

<L>The Mycenaeans with uplifted shields,</L>

<L>Here Abradates, there Mazaeus press'd,</L>

Propt on his spear; his wound forbids retreat.</L>
<L>None, but his brother Eumenes, abide</L>

<L>Full on his arm its dreadful weight discharg'd.</L>
<L>Down with the buckler drops the sever'd hand,</L>
<L>Nor quits its grasp. Now sink the wretched pair</L>
<L>Beneath the Persian's unresisted steel:</L>
<L N="445">From both their breasts the vital currents flow,</L>
<L>And mix their streams. Elate the Persians roll</L>
<L>Their deepning legions on the foes dismay'd.</L>
<L>The Greeks their station painfully maintain.</L>
<L>This soon the faithless Anaxander saw,</L>

<L>THIS is the time to aid our Persian friends.</L>

<L>His gen'rous troop, who riveting their shields</L>
<L>In dense array indissolubly firm</L>
<L>Confront the Persians, and with death repulse</L>
<L N="480">Their scatter'd numbers; when with efforts vain</L>
<L>They oft renew'd the contest, and recoil'd</L>
<L>As oft confounded with diminish'd ranks,</L>
<L>Thus Hyperanthes counsell'd. Learn, O chiefs,</L>
<L>From whence alone success can grace our arms.</L>
<L N="485">These are a band selected from the Greeks,</L>
<L>Unlike the others, whom we lately chas'd;</L>

Perhaps the Spartans, whom we oft have heard</L>
<L>By Demaratus prais'd. To break their line</L>
<L>False is the hope, while unarray'd, and lax,</L>
<L N="490">And wanting union singly we assail</L>
<L>Their strength collected. Do not we preside</L>

From those, whom Asia boasts her bravest sons,</L>
<L>Who from their king perpetual stipends share;</L>
<L N="505">And station'd round his provinces by arms</L>
<L>His tyranny sustain. In ev'ry part</L>
<L>Is Hyperanthes seen with active care</L>
<L>To form the huge battalion. Soon they stand</L>
<L>In just array, when cautious, lest their march</L>
<L N="510">Might still relax their order, Persia's prince</L>

<HEAD>LEONIDAS. BOOK VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Night coming on, the Grecians retire to their tents. A guard is plac'd on the Phocian wall under the command of Agis. He admits into the camp a lady accompanied by a single slave, and conducts them to Leonidas; when she discovers herself to be Ariana, sister of Xerxes and Hyperanthes, and sues for the body of Teribazus; which being found among the slain, she kills herself upon it. The slave, who at∣tended her, proves to be Polydorus, brother of Alpheus and Maron, and who had been formerly carried into captivity by a Phoenician pirate. He relates before an assembly of the chiefs a message from Demaratus to the Spartans, which discloses the treachery of the The∣bans, and of Epialtes, the Malian, who had undertaken to lead part of the Persian army through a pass among the mountains of Oeta. This information throws the council into a great tumult, which is pacified by Leonidas, who sends Alpheus to observe the motions of these Persians, and Dieneces with a party of Lacedaemonians to support the Phocians, with whom the defence of these passages in the hills had been intrusted. In the mean time Agis sends the bodies of Teribazus and Ariana to the camp of Xerxes.</P>

<L>IN sable pomp with all her starry train</L>

<L N="5">Who watch'd th' uncertain perils of the dark,</L>
<L>An hundred warriours: Agis was their chief.</L>
<L>High on the wall intent the hero sat,</L>
<L>As o'er the surface of the tranquil main</L>
<L>Along its undulating breast the wind</L>
<L N="10">The various din of Asia's host convey'd</L>
<L>In one deep murmur swelling in his ear:</L>
<L>When by the sound of footsteps down the pass</L>
<L>Alarm'd he calls aloud. What feet are those,</L>

<L>Whate'er the lilly blending with the rose</L>
<L>Paints on the cheek of beauty soon to fade;</L>
<L N="40">Such as express'd a mind, which wisdom rul'd,</L>

<L>Malignant Fortune to revere the good,</L>

Which oft with anguish rends the spotless heart,</L>

<L>Before the great Leonidas to place</L>
<L>This your apparent dignity and worth.</L>

<L>HE spake, and gently to the lofty tent</L>
<L N="55">Of Sparta's king the lovely stranger guides.</L>
<L>At Agis' summons with a mantle broad</L>
<L>His mighty limbs Leonidas infolds,</L>

Her eye submissive to the ground inclin'd</L>
<L>With veneration of the godlike man.</L>

<L N="70">ON her wan cheek a sudden blush arose,</L>

<L>O ALPHEUS! Maron! hither turn your sight,</L>

<L>From either burst, with tears of transport mix'd,</L>
<L>The name of Polydorus. On his breast</L>

<L>While down his cheek a stream of anguish pours</L>

<L>THEN Polydorus to the list'ning chiefs.</L>
<L>I was a Spartan. When my tender prime</L>
<L N="240">On manhood border'd, from my native shore</L>
<L>Snatch'd by Phoenician pirates, I was sold,</L>
<L>To Ariana, sister to the king</L>
<L>And Hyperanthes. Fortune there was kind</L>
<L>My bonds committing to that gentle hand.</L>
<L N="245">Yet was I still a captive, and estrang'd</L>
<L>From Lacedaemon. Demaratus oft</L>
<L>With friendly sorrows would my lot deplore,</L>
<L><PB N="220" REF="238"/>
Nor less his own ill-fated virtue mourn'd</L>
<L>Lost to his country in a servile court,</L>
<L N="250">The center of corruption; where in smiles</L>
<L>Is envy painted, treachery, and hate,</L>
<L>And rankling malice; where alone sincere</L>
<L>The dissolute seeks no disguise: where he</L>
<L>Who all possesses, that a king can give,</L>
<L N="255">Is far less happy than the meanest son</L>
<L>Of liberty, and groveling, as the slave,</L>
<L>Who serves his cruel pride. Yet here the sun</L>
<L>Ten times his annual period hath renew'd,</L>
<L>Since Polydorus hath in bondage groan'd.</L>
<L N="260">My bloom now past, or else by pining care</L>
<L>Untimely wither'd, I at last return,</L>
<L>And to my native land the tydings bear</L>

<L N="270">Such was the solemn silence, which o'erspread</L>
<L>The shrine of Ammon, or Dodona's shades,</L>
<L>When anxious mortals from the mouth of Jove</L>
<L>Their doom explor'd. Nor Polydorus long</L>
<L>Suspends the Grecians, but resumes his tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="275">AS I this night accompanied the steps</L>
<L>Of Ariana, e'er we reach'd the straits</L>
<L>Before our view then op'ning, one appear'd</L>

His restless pace. As nearer we approach'd,</L>

<L>Upon your paths may heav'n's protection smile.</L>
<L>Soon as you mix with yon triumphant tents,</L>

The parent and the husband, from his wife,</L>

<L>Return'd a Malian, Epialtes nam'd,</L>
<L>Who as a spy had sought the Grecian tents.</L>
<L>He to the tyrant magnified his art,</L>

<L>The Greeks to such despair, that Asia's king</L>

Restor'd their valour: therefore would the king</L>

<L>Where no Leonidas should bar their way.</L>
<L N="320">Meantime by him the treach'rous Thebans sent</L>
<L>Assurance of their aid. Th' assenting king</L>

<HEAD>LEONIDAS. BOOK VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>The bodies of Teribazus and Ariana are brought into the presence of Xerxes, soon after a report had reach'd the camp, that half his navy was shipwreck'd. The Persian monarch, quite dispirited, is persuaded by Argestes, one of the satraps, to send an ambassador to the Spartan king. Argestes himself is deputed, who, after revealing his ambassy to Leonidas in secret, is by him led before the whole army, and there receives his answer. In the mean time Alpheus returns and declares, that the enemies were possess'd of the passages in the hills, and were hastening to Thermopylae, upon which Leonidas offers to send away all the army except his three hundred Spartans; but Diomedon, Demo∣philus, Dithyrambus, and Megistias refuse to depart: he then dis∣misses Argestes, informs the Grecians of his design to attack the Persian camp in the night, and making all the necessary dispositions retires to his pavilion.</P>

<PB N="236" REF="254"/>
<L>BEFORE the tent of Xerxes now arriv'd</L>
<L>The Persian captives. On with solemn pace</L>
<L>And slow they move. The monarch from afar</L>
<L>Descries their sad demeanour. They approach,</L>
<L N="5">Nor he forbids. That morn had Rumour told</L>
<L>The loss of half his navy dash'd on rocks</L>
<L>By angry blasts, or buried in the surge.</L>
<L>Thus, when his bleeding sister met his eyes,</L>
<L>Already sunk in sadness, he had lost</L>
<L N="10">His kingly pride, the parent of disdain,</L>
<L>And cold indifference for others woes;</L>
<L>Nor ev'n beside his sister's nobler corse</L>
<L>Her humble lover now his scorn awak'd.</L>
<L>In tears the captive's mournful tale he heard,</L>
<L N="15">And then first knew compassion; but e'er long</L>
<L>Those traces vanish'd from the tyrant's breast:</L>
<L><PB N="237" REF="255"/>
His former gloom redoubles, for himself</L>
<L>His anxious bosom heaves, and now he fears,</L>
<L>Lest he with all his numbers should be cast</L>
<L N="20">A prey to Fortune. Near the monarch stood</L>
<L>The Spartan exile, whom he thus bespake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O DEMARATUS, what will fate ordain!</L>
<L>Lo! Fortune turns against me! Who shall know</L>
<L>How far her daring malice may extend,</L>
<L N="25">Which rages now so near me, and hath made</L>
<L>My house the seat of ruin? I have sent</L>
<L>From my unshelter'd side my bravest chiefs,</L>
<L>And choicest troops to pass the desart hill,</L>
<L>Led by this Malian; may not there the Greeks</L>
<L N="30">With opposition more tremendous still</L>
<L>And ruinous, than yester sun beheld,</L>
<L>Resistless hold their craggy post; renew</L>
<L><PB N="238" REF="256"/>
Their stony thunder with augmented rage,</L>
<L>And send whole quarries down the rocky steep</L>
<L N="35">Again to crush my legions? Oh! unfold</L>
<L>Thy secret soul, nor hide the harshest truth;</L>
<L>Say what remains to hope? The exile here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF truth unblam'd may issue from my lips,</L>
<L>Too well, imperial Xerxes, you presage</L>
<L N="40">What may befal your legions. If the Greeks</L>
<L>Arrang'd within Thermopylae, a pass</L>
<L>Accessible and spacious, could repel</L>
<L>With such destruction their unnumber'd foes;</L>
<L>What scenes of havoc must th' untrodden paths,</L>
<L N="45">Confin'd among the craggy hills, afford?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IMMERS'D in care the monarch silent sat.</L>
<L>Amid th' incircling peers Argestes stood.</L>
<L><PB N="239" REF="257"/>
A potent prince. On Sipylus he reign'd.</L>
<L>Whose lofty summits overlook'd the waves</L>
<L N="50">Of Hermus and Pactolus; either stream</L>
<L>Enrich'd with golden sands its tribute bore</L>
<L>To this great satrap: through the servile court</L>
<L>Yet was there none more practic'd in the arts</L>
<L>Of mean submission; none more skill'd to gain</L>
<L N="55">The royal favour; none, who better knew</L>
<L>The phrase, the looks, and gesture of a slave.</L>
<L>In soothing words he thus the king bespake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF Xerxes will to spare his faithful bands,</L>
<L>And not exert the terrours of his pow'r;</L>
<L N="60">More gentle means of conquest than by arms,</L>

<L>Renown'd Darius, thy imperial sire</L>

The fields of proud Euphrates with his host</L>
<L N="65">O'erspread; at length confiding in the wiles</L>
<L>Of Zopyrus the mighty king subdu'd</L>
<L>The Babylonian tow'rs: but who shall count,</L>
<L>What num'rous states by policy have fall'n;</L>
<L>And let corruption once her aid impart,</L>

<L>Such probity and wisdom, whom the veil</L>

<L N="75">Through all thy empire, which from India's shore</L>
<L>Shall reach Eurotas soon, no dazzling gift</L>
<L>To gain the Grecian leader? O dispel</L>
<L>The cloud of sadness from those sacred eyes,</L>
<L>And proffer streight to Lacedaemon's chief,</L>
<L N="80">What may thy own munificence declare,</L>
<L><PB N="241" REF="259"/>
And win his sword to aid thee. Xerxes here,</L>

<L>Alone the hero meditating sat</L>
<L>On future woes to Persia. At his feet</L>

<L>Before thy awful presence Xerxes wills,</L>

And thus accost thee. Great and matchless chief,</L>

Yet how much greater thou, whom gen'ral Greece,</L>
<L>That teems with mightiest states, shall call her lord,</L>
<L N="115">Thee only worthy. How will Greece rejoice</L>
<L>Around thy throne, and hail th' auspicious hour,</L>
<L>When thou, selected by the Persian king</L>
<L>To bless consenting nations with thy sway,</L>
<L>Didst calm the fury of unsparing war,</L>
<L N="120">Which else had delug'd all with blood and flames!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE said. The chief replies not, but commands</L>
<L>The Thespian youth, who near the tent had watch'd,</L>
<L>To summon all the Grecians. He obeys.</L>
<L>While from his seat the hero mov'd, and bade</L>
<L N="125">The Persian follow. He amaz'd attends,</L>
<L>Surrounded soon by all the Grecian bands;</L>
<L>When him the godlike Spartan thus bespake.</L>

<L>HERE, Persian, tell thy ambassy, repeat,</L>
<L>That to obtain my friendship Asia's lord</L>

<L>The indignation painted on their looks,</L>

<L>THE hero ceas'd, when suddenly return'd</L>
<L>The speed of Alpheus; all suspended streight</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>E'ER I could join the Phocians, from the hill,</L>
<L N="140">Which overhung the close defile, I view'd</L>
<L>The pow'rs of Persia. Down the narrow strait</L>
<L><PB N="245" REF="263"/>
No sooner gleam'd th' innumerable spears,</L>

<LG>

<L>Did I not face the Marathonian war?</L>

<L>He ended, when Demophilus subjoin'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O KING of Sparta, pride of human race,</L>
<L N="195">Whom none e'er equall'd, but the seed of Jove,</L>
<L>Thy own forefather number'd with the Gods,</L>
<L>Lo! I am old. With faltring steps I tread</L>

<L><PB N="249" REF="267"/>
The eve of life. So spake the hoary chief,</L>
<L>When Dithyrambus next. O first of Greeks,</L>

<L>With this most dear and venerable man</L>
<L N="210">For ever honour'd from my tend'rest age,</L>
<L>Ev'n till on life's extremity we part.</L>
<L>Nor too aspiring let my hopes be deem'd;</L>
<L>Should the Barbarian in his triumphs mark</L>
<L>My youthful limbs among the gory heaps,</L>
<L N="215">Thence may his fears be doubled, when again</L>
<L>He meets in fields hereafter to be known</L>
<L>The Grecian standards, trembling at a foe,</L>
<L>To whom the flow'r, and blooming joys of life</L>
<L>Are less alluring than a noble fate.</L>
</LG>

<L N="220">TO him Demophilus. Wilt thou too bleed,</L>
<L>My Dithyrambus?—But I here withhold</L>
<L><PB N="250" REF="268"/>
All counsel from thee, who art wise, as brave.</L>
<L>If then thy magnanimity retain</L>
<L>Thee too with great Leonidas to fall,</L>
<L N="225">At either's side our limbs shall press the ground,</L>
<L>And drop together in the arms of Death;</L>
<L>So if th' attentive traveller we draw</L>
<L>To our cold reliques, wondring shall he trace</L>
<L>The diff'rent scene, and pregnant with applause,</L>
<L N="230">O wise old man, exclaim, thou well hast chose</L>
<L>The hour of fate: and O unequall'd youth,</L>
<L>Who to thy country didst thy bloom devote,</L>

<L>May Time rejoice to name thee! and may Peace</L>
<L N="230">With gentlest pinions hover o'er thy urn!</L>

<LG>
<L>THIS said, the hero with his lifted shield</L>
<L>His face o'ershades, and drops a secret tear;</L>
<L><PB N="251" REF="269"/>
Not this the tear of anguish, but deriv'd</L>
<L>From fond affection grown mature with time;</L>
<L N="240">Which in a feebler mind to pain had turn'd,</L>
<L>But in the Thespian's firm and virtuous breast,</L>
<L>Alone a manly tenderness awak'd</L>
<L>Unmix'd with pity, or with vain regret.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MEGISTIAS last address'd the Spartan chief.</L>
<L N="245">Thou, whom the Gods have chosen to exalt</L>
<L>Above mankind in virtue and renown,</L>

<L>To Lacedaemon I a stranger came.</L>

<L>Nor let my fear neglect this happy hour</L>
<L N="260">To shew the Spartans, I deserv'd their care.</L>
<L>Thou, Menalippus, hear the king's command,</L>
<L>And my paternal tenderness revere.</L>
<L>Do thou withdraw thee from me, to my hand</L>
<L>Thy arms resigning. Fortune will supply</L>
<L N="262">Fresh toil for valour. Vanquish then, or find</L>
<L>A glorious grave; but spare thy father's eye</L>
<L>The bitter anguish to behold thy youth</L>
<L><PB N="253" REF="271"/>
Untimely bleed before him. Grief suspends</L>
<L>His speech, and interchangeably their arms</L>
<L N="270">Impart their last embraces. Either wept,</L>
<L>The hoary parent, and the blooming son.</L>
<L>But from his temples the pontific wreath</L>
<L>Megistias now unloosens, and resigns</L>
<L>His hallow'd vestments; while the youth with tears</L>
<L N="275">The helmet buckles o'er his snowy locks,</L>
<L>And on his breast adjusts the radiant mail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILE such contempt of life, such fervid zeal</L>
<L>To die with glory animate the Greeks,</L>
<L>Far other thoughts possess Argestes' soul.</L>
<L N="280">Amaze with mingled terrour smote his heart;</L>
<L>Cold drops, distill'd from ev'ry pore, bedew</L>
<L>His shiv'ring limbs; his bosom pants; his knees</L>

Pale are his lips and trembling: such the minds</L>
<L N="285">Of slaves corrupt, to them the beauteous face</L>

<L>The Grecians faithful to their post await</L>

Accus'd by one alone, a banish'd wretch,</L>

<HEAD>LEONIDAS. BOOK VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Leonidas rising about three hours before midnight relates to an assembly of the leaders a dream, which is interpreted by Megistias; he then arms himself, and marches in procession with his whole troop to an altar newly rais'd on a neighbouring meadow, and there offers a sacrifice to the Muses: he invokes the assistance of those Goddesses, he animates his companions, and then placing himself at their head leads them against the enemy in the dead of the night.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>SCARCE was begun the second watch of night,</L>
<L>When his pavilion Agis left, and sought</L>
<L>The chief of Lacedaemon. Him he found</L>
<L>Spread on his tranquil couch, while, o'er his face</L>
<L N="5"><PB N="266" REF="284"/>
Diffus'd, a glad serenity with smiles</L>
<L>His slumber painted; like an ev'ning sky</L>
<L>Yet streak'd with ruddy light, when summer suns</L>
<L>Have veil'd their beaming foreheads. Transport fill'd</L>
<L>The eye of Agis. Friendship swell'd his heart,</L>
<L N="10">And veneration. On his knee inclin'd</L>
<L>The hero's hand he kiss'd, and thus began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O THOU with more than human virtues great,</L>
<L>Accept this homage! and may gentle sleep</L>
<L>Yet longer close thy eyelids, that unblam'd</L>
<L N="15">I thus may bow before thee. Thus he spake,</L>
<L>And, prostrate bent, his godlike friend rever'd,</L>
<L>Whose eye the shades of slumber now forsake.</L>
<L>So, when new rising heav'n's resplendent orb</L>
<L>Illumines first the sable skirts of night,</L>
<L N="20">The white-rob'd Magi, or the Indian seers</L>
<L><PB N="267" REF="285"/>
Are seen from Ganges, or Euphrates' side,</L>
<L>Before th' emerging glory bow'd to hail</L>
<L>The radiant emblem of th' immortal mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BOTH heroes rose, and mix'd their friendly arms,</L>
<L N="25">And now to Agis had the Spartan king</L>
<L>Disclos'd his soul; when lo! the Grecian chiefs,</L>
<L>All rous'd, advancing with the sudden gleam</L>
<L>Of armour pierc'd the twilight shade. With joy</L>
<L>Leonidas accosts them. O thrice hail!</L>
<L N="30">My virtuous friends. Approach, and all attend,</L>
<L>While I relate, and you with wonder hear.</L>
<L>This night no sooner sleep oppress'd my brows,</L>
<L>But o'er my head the empyreal form</L>
<L>Of my great sire Alcides seem'd display'd.</L>
<L N="35">I saw his magnitude divine; his voice</L>
<L>I heard, his solemn mandate to arise.</L>
<L><PB N="268" REF="286"/>
I rose. He bade me follow: I obey'd.</L>
<L>Up to a mountain, whose ethereal brow</L>
<L>Th' involving clouds divided, we ascend.</L>
<L N="40">E'er long we rested, suddenly the howl</L>
<L>Of wolves, and dogs, the vulture's piercing shriek,</L>
<L>The yell of ev'ry beast and fowl of prey,</L>
<L>Within my ears discordant broke. I turn'd.</L>
<L>When lo! a surface all with gore deform'd</L>
<L N="45">Beyond my view illimitable stretch'd,</L>
<L>One vast expanse of horrour. There a corse,</L>
<L>Which with its huge dimensions seem'd to hide</L>
<L>Th' unbounded plain, lay welt'ring, red with wounds</L>
<L>Delv'd in th' enormous limbs, which bleeding gorg'd</L>
<L N="50">The vulture's famine. Wond'ring I beheld,</L>
<L>When from behind I heard a second sound,</L>
<L>Like surges trembling o'er a craggy shore.</L>
<L>Again I turn'd. An ocean there appear'd</L>
<L><PB N="269" REF="287"/>
With riven keels, and shrouds, and shiver'd oars,</L>
<L N="55">With arms, and mangled carcases bestrewn</L>
<L>Innumerous. The billows foam'd with blood,</L>
<L>And whelm'd a crimson deluge o'er the strand.</L>
<L>But where the waters unobserv'd before</L>
<L>Between two adverse shores contracting roll'd</L>
<L N="60">A stormy tide, upon the beach, forlorn,</L>
<L>One of majestic stature I descried</L>
<L>In ornaments imperial. Oft on me</L>
<L>He bent his clouded eye-balls. On my name</L>
<L>With imprecations oft he call'd aloud,</L>
<L N="65">Then rent his splendid garments, and his head</L>
<L>In rage divested of its graceful hairs.</L>
<L>Impatient now he ey'd a slender skiff,</L>
<L>Which mounted on the curling foam approach'd.</L>
<L>With indignation, and reluctant grief</L>
<L N="70">Once more his sight reverting, he embark'd</L>
<L><PB N="270" REF="288"/>
Amid the perils of the frowning waves.</L>
<L>O thou, whose virtue rank'd thee with the Gods</L>
<L>(I here exclaim'd) instruct me what produc'd</L>
<L>This desolation; when the God return'd.</L>
<L N="75">Let thy astonish'd eye again review</L>
<L>What thou didst late abhor. I look'd and saw</L>
<L>A land, where Plenty with disporting hand</L>
<L>Pour'd all the fruits of Amalthea's horn;</L>
<L>Where bloom'd the olive, and the clustring vine</L>
<L N="80">With its broad foliage mantled ev'ry hill;</L>
<L>Where Ceres with exuberance inrob'd</L>
<L>The pregnant bosom of the fields in gold;</L>
<L>Where spacious towns, whose circuits proud contain'd</L>
<L>The dazling works of wealth, unnumber'd shone,</L>
<L N="85">The strength and splendour of the peopled land.</L>
<L>Then in a moment clouds obscur'd my sight,</L>
<L>And all was vanish'd from my waking eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="271" REF="289"/>
<L>THRICE we salute the omen (thus began</L>
<L>The sage Megistias) in thy mystic dream</L>
<L N="90">I see the Grecian victories. The earth,</L>
<L>The deep shall own their triumphs; and the tears</L>
<L>Of Asia, and of Lybia shall bewail</L>
<L>Their offspring cast before the vulture's beak,</L>
<L>And all the monstrous natives of the main.</L>
<L N="95">Those joyous fields of plenty shall be Greece</L>
<L>Enrich'd with conquest, and Barbarian spoils.</L>
<L>And whom thou saw'st in regal vesture clad</L>
<L>Print on the sands his solitary steps,</L>
<L>Is Xerxes foil'd and fugitive from Greece.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="100">MEGISTIAS thus, while ev'ry bosom felt</L>
<L>Enthusiastic rapture, joy beyond</L>
<L>All sense, and all conception but of those,</L>
<L><PB N="272" REF="290"/>
Who die to save their country. Here again</L>
<L>Leonidas th' exulting chiefs address'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="105">SINCE happiness from virtue is deriv'd,</L>
<L>Who for his country dies, that moment proves</L>
<L>Most happy, as most virtuous. Such our lot.</L>
<L>To this the gods shall add eternal fame.</L>
<L>But now go forth, Megistias, and with speed</L>
<L N="110">Prepare the victim, and the sacred flames;</L>
<L>That to the Muses, as the Spartan law</L>
<L>Commands, our pray'rs and off'rings may be paid,</L>
<L>E'er to yon camp our hostile feet we bend.</L>
<L>But, O remember, from the solemn rites</L>
<L N="115">Let ev'ry sound be absent, not the pipe,</L>
<L>Nor ev'n the music-breathing flute be heard.</L>
<L>Meantime, ye leaders, ev'ry band instruct</L>
<L>To move in silence, nor with shouts alarm</L>
<L><PB N="273" REF="291"/>
The midnight stillness. Mindful of their charge</L>
<L N="120">The chiefs depart. Leonidas provides</L>
<L>His various armour. First the breastplate arms</L>
<L>His ample chest. O'er this the hero spreads</L>
<L>The mailed cuirass from his shoulders hung.</L>
<L>The shining belt infolds his mighty loins.</L>
<L N="125">Next on his stately temples he erects</L>
<L>The plumed helm, then grasps his pond'rous shield;</L>
<L>Where nigh the center on the swelling brass</L>
<L>Th' inimitable artist had imboss'd</L>
<L>The shape of great Alcides, whom to gain</L>
<L N="130">Two Goddesses contended. Pleasure here</L>
<L>Won with soft wiles th' attracted eye, and there</L>
<L>The form of Virtue dignified the scene.</L>
<L>In her majestic sweetness was disclos'd</L>
<L>The mind sublime and happy. From her lips</L>
<L N="135">Seem'd eloquence to flow. With looks serene,</L>
<L><PB N="274" REF="292"/>
But fix'd intent upon the son of Jove,</L>
<L>She wav'd her hand, where winding to the skies</L>
<L>Her paths ascended. On the summit stood</L>
<L>Fame, and protended her eternal trump,</L>
<L N="140">Incumbent on a trophy near to heav'n.</L>
<L>The youth attentive to her wisdom own'd</L>
<L>The prevalence of Virtue; while his eye</L>
<L>With all the spirit, which redeem'd the world</L>
<L>From tyranny and monsters, ardent flam'd;</L>
<L N="145">Not undescried by Pleasure, where she lay</L>
<L>Stretch'd on a gorgeous carpet, which bespread</L>
<L>The meadow with magnificence. Around</L>
<L>Were flourets strewn, and wantonly in rills</L>
<L>Soft streams maeander'd. All relax'd her limbs:</L>
<L N="150">Nor wanting yet solicitude to gain,</L>
<L>What lost she fear'd, as struggling with despair</L>
<L>She seem'd collecting all her power of charms,</L>
<L><PB N="275" REF="293"/>
And with excess of sweet allurement smil'd:</L>
<L>In vain; for Virtue sway'd Alcides' mind.</L>
<L N="155">Hence all his labours. Trac'd with various art</L>
<L>They fill'd the surface of the spacious targe.</L>
<L>This portraiture of glory on his arm</L>
<L>Leonidas supports. Then forth he tow'rs</L>
<L>From his pavilion. With their troops array'd</L>
<L N="160">The chiefs attended. Flaming torches blaz'd</L>
<L>In ev'ry hand. And now with silent pace</L>
<L>All to the solemn sacrifice proceed.</L>
<L>First Polydorus with the hallow'd knife,</L>
<L>And barley strew'd with sacred salt advanc'd.</L>
<L N="165">Diomedon beside him, in his grasp</L>
<L>A weighty mace sustaining. Like the rest</L>
<L>All bright in armour with his shield and spear</L>
<L>Megistias follow'd, an unspotted priest,</L>
<L>And dauntless warriour. From on high his helm</L>
<L N="170"><PB N="276" REF="294"/>
With wreaths around the shining crest reveal'd</L>
<L>His sacerdotal honours. By the horns,</L>
<L>Where laurels twin'd, with Alpheus Maron leads</L>
<L>The consecrated ox. And lo! behind</L>
<L>Leonidas approaches. Ne'er before</L>
<L N="175">With such transcending majesty he trod,</L>
<L>Nor his own virtue, as that hour, enjoy'd.</L>
<L>Then venerable moves the Thespian chief,</L>
<L>And great Dieneces. To them the bloom</L>
<L>Of Dithyrambus glowing with the sense</L>
<L N="180">Of future praise succeeds, with graceful steps</L>
<L>The gen'rous Agis next; the Thebans last</L>
<L>Repining and inglorious. Then slow march</L>
<L>The host all mute, nor shake their brazen arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOT from Thermopylae remote the hills</L>
<L N="185">Of Oeta yielding to a fruitful dale</L>
<L><PB N="277" REF="295"/>
Within their side half-circling had inclos'd</L>
<L>A fair expanse with verdure smooth. The bounds</L>
<L>Were edg'd with wood o'erlook'd by snowy cliffs,</L>
<L>Which from the clouds bent frowning. From a rock</L>
<L N="190">Above the loftiest summit of the groves</L>
<L>A tumbling torrent wore the shagged stone,</L>
<L>Then gleaming through the interwoven shade</L>
<L>The valley water'd. O'er the level shone</L>
<L>Its glassy bosom, and with placid waves</L>
<L N="195">The smiling lawn divided. Near the banks,</L>
<L>Which flow'rs made various, new-erected stood</L>
<L>A rustic altar, which a chosen train,</L>
<L>Appointed by Megistias, rais'd with turf</L>
<L>Cut by their falchions from the verdant mead:</L>
<L N="200">Broad was the surface, high with piles of wood,</L>
<L>The plenteous tribute of th' adjacent groves,</L>
<L>All interspers'd with laurel. Here a vase</L>
<L><PB N="278" REF="296"/>
Fill'd with the briny waters of the sea,</L>
<L>(More pure than ev'ry stream, or fountain, deem'd)</L>
<L N="205">Was plac'd beside the altar. There with wine</L>
<L>Unmix'd capacious goblets stood arrang'd.</L>
<L>Here is the victim brought. Megistias streight</L>
<L>His helm unloosens. With his hoary head</L>
<L>Uncover'd round the solemn pile he treads,</L>
<L N="210">And with a branch of laurel scatters wide</L>
<L>The sacred moisture of the main. His hand</L>
<L>With mingled salt and barley next bestrews</L>
<L>The altar, and the victim. O'er the horns</L>
<L>Th' inverted goblet foaming with the grape</L>
<L N="215">Diffus'd the rich libation. Now advanc'd</L>
<L>Diomedon. Megistias gave command.</L>
<L>Down sunk the victim with a deathful stroke,</L>
<L>Nor groan'd. Megistias buries in the throat</L>
<L>The hallow'd steel. A crimson deluge flows.</L>
<L N="220"><PB N="279" REF="297"/>
Swift from the limbs the fuming hide is torn,</L>
<L>The flesh dissever'd on the altar heap'd.</L>
<L>Now smoaks the pile, then sudden flames abroad.</L>
<L>A burst of splendour dissipates the dark.</L>
<L>Greece throngs around. Each lifts a sparkling brand</L>
<L N="225">With beaming javelins intermix'd, and shields,</L>
<L>And polish'd helms, which multiply the blaze.</L>
<L>Meantime the great Leonidas drew nigh,</L>
<L>And stood before the altar. There his helm</L>
<L>Unclasp'd to Agis he commits, his shield</L>
<L N="230">And spear to Dithyrambus, then his arms</L>
<L>Extending thus in supplication spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HARMONIOUS daughters of Olympian Jove,</L>
<L>Who on the top of Helicon ador'd,</L>

And Aganippe's murmurs, if from thence</L>

Or on the joyous festival inspire</L>
<L>With loftier strains the virgins choral song.</L>
<L N="255">Then, O celestial maids, on yonder camp</L>
<L>Let night sit heavy, and a sleep, like death,</L>

By nations fall'n.—You, countrymen and friends,</L>

<L>Too well by this expiring blaze I view</L>
<L N="275">Impatient valour flash from ev'ry eye.</L>

And future flight, when Greece confounds that pow'r,</L>
<L>Which we will shake. But now the second watch</L>
<L>Is verging to its period, and the moon</L>
<L N="290">Prepares to glimmer on our darksome steps.</L>
<L>Let each his head distinguish with a wreath</L>

<L>WHILE thus the hero, through the thronging files</L>
<L>Presenting round a hideous depth of war</L>

By ev'ry hand, and round each helmet wove</L>
<L N="305">It blends its verdure with the floating plumes.</L>
<L>Then is the victim portion'd, while the bowl</L>
<L>Flows with the vine's impurpled stream. Aloof</L>
<L>The Theban train in wan dejection mute</L>
<L>Brood o'er their shame, or cast a frighted eye</L>
<L N="310">On that determin'd virtue, which unmov'd</L>
<L>At fate's approach with chearful lips could taste</L>
<L>The sparkling goblet, and with joy partake</L>
<L>That last and glorious banquet. Ev'n the heart</L>

None heed your motions. Separate, and fly</L>
<L>With silent steps. At once the Theban troop</L>

<L>Descends soft-trickling, while the hoary heap</L>

<HEAD>LEONIDAS. BOOK IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Leonidas and the Grecians penetrate through the Persian camp to the very pavilion of Xerxes, who avoids destruction by flight. The Bar∣barians are slaughter'd in great multitudes, and their camp is set on fire. Leonidas conducts his men back to Thermopylae, engages the Persians, who were descended from the hills, and after numberless proofs of superiour strength and valour sinks down cover'd with wounds, and expires the last of all the Grecian commanders.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THE waining moon display'd her gleaming horns,</L>
<L>When o'er th' unguarded bound of Asia's camp</L>
<L>Now pass'd the Grecians. Through th' unnumber'd tents,</L>
<L>Where all was mute and tranquil, they pursue</L>
<L N="5"><PB N="293" REF="311"/>
Their silent march. The eastern world around</L>
<L>Lay stretch'd in slumber, motionless, and deaf,</L>
<L>Wrapt in the dead security of night,</L>
<L>Nor mark'd the steps of Fate. The wary Greeks</L>
<L>By Polydorus guided still proceed.</L>
<L N="10">Ev'n to the center of th' extensive host</L>
<L>Unseen they pierc'd, when now th' imperial tent</L>
<L>Yet distant rose before them. Wide around</L>
<L>The proud pavilion stretch'd an ample space,</L>
<L>Where myriads might imbattle. Here a band</L>
<L N="15">Of chosen Persians watchful round their king</L>
<L>Held their nocturnal station. As the hearts</L>
<L>Of anxious nations menac'd with the waste</L>
<L>Of meager famine, and the ruthless sword</L>
<L>Sink in their frozen bosoms, while despair</L>
<L N="20">Sees fear-ingender'd fantoms in the sky,</L>
<L>Aërial hosts amid the clouds array'd,</L>
<L><PB N="294" REF="312"/>
Which seem to shake the firmament with war,</L>
<L>Portending woe and death; the Persians thus</L>
<L>Are smote with consternation, as the moon</L>
<L N="25">By her faint beam discover'd from afar</L>
<L>The glimpse of Grecian arms. With sudden cries</L>
<L>They waken Horrour, which to Xerxes' couch,</L>
<L>And o'er th' astonish'd host, swift-winged flew</L>
<L>Dispelling sleep and silence. All the camp</L>
<L N="30">Pours forth its numbers naked, pale, unarm'd,</L>

<L N="210">Again thy voice, Leonidas, is heard;</L>
<L>The Grecians turn; against the op'ning pass</L>

<L N="440"><PB N="319" REF="337"/>
Record one loveliest of the youthful train,</L>
<L>The good, the gentle, generous, and brave;</L>
<L>Now fall'n his country's grace, and parent's pride:</L>
<L>So sinks the cedar, which in verdant bloom</L>
<L>High on the top of Libanus had stood</L>
<L N="445">The mountain's boast, and glory of the grove;</L>
<L>Then to adorn the mansions of the great,</L>
<L>Or dignify some God's high-vaulted fane</L>
<L>Uprooted low'rs its heav'n-aspiring head.</L>
<L>Diomedon bursts forward. Round his friend</L>
<L N="450">He heaps destruction. What a troop of ghosts</L>
<L>Attend thy shade, fall'n hero! Long unmatch'd</L>
<L>Prevail'd his vengeful arm, and Persia bled;</L>
<L>Till four Assyrians on his shelving lance,</L>
<L>E'er yet extracted from a prostrate corse,</L>
<L N="455">Their pond'rous maces all discharge. It broke.</L>
<L>Yet with the truncheon of his shatter'd spear</L>
<L><PB N="320" REF="338"/>
The Greek sustains the contest. Through his eye</L>
<L>The shiver'd fragment penetrates the brain</L>
<L>Of one bold warriour; there the splintry wood</L>
<L N="460">Infix'd remains: the hero then unsheaths</L>
<L>His falchion broad; a second views aghast</L>
<L>His entrails falling, while Plataea's chief</L>
<L>From the gash'd belly draws his reeking sword:</L>
<L>Prone sinks a third beneath the falchion's weight;</L>
<L N="465">Though with the furious stroke the yielding blade</L>
<L>Flew from the hilt, and left the Greek disarm'd:</L>
<L>The fourth that instant lifts his knotted mace;</L>
<L>It falls resistless on the batter'd helm,</L>
<L>And low the great Diomedon extends</L>
<L N="470">His mighty limbs. So weaken'd by the force</L>
<L>Of some tremendous engine, which the hand</L>
<L>Of Mars impells, a stately turret spreads</L>
<L>Its disuniting ramparts on the plain;</L>
<L><PB N="321" REF="339"/>
Joy fills th' assailants, while the battle's tide</L>
<L>Whelms o'er the widening breach. The Persians thus</L>
<L N="476">O'er the late-fear'd Diomedon had rush'd,</L>
<L>And swept the Greeks before them; when behold</L>
<L>Leonidas! At once their ardour froze.</L>
<L>He had a while within the orb retir'd,</L>
<L N="480">Oppress'd by labour. Now with strength restor'd</L>
<L>He pours fresh ruin from the Spartan front.</L>
<L>As, long retarded by th' unmoving calm,</L>
<L>Soon, as a rising gale fresh-breathing curls</L>
<L>The surging main, again the vessel bounds</L>
<L N="485">With all her op'ning sails; the hero thus</L>
<L>His buckler huge, and formidable spear</L>
<L>Advancing, through the Asian files renews</L>
<L>His course of slaughter. Destiny compells</L>
<L>The bold Hydarnes to th' unequal fight,</L>
<L N="490">Who proudly vaunting left his weeping bride</L>
<L><PB N="322" REF="340"/>
To mourn his absence on the distant verge</L>
<L>Of Bactrian Ochus. Victory in vain</L>
<L>He parting promis'd. Wanton hope no more</L>
<L>Round his cold heart delusive sports, nor paints</L>
<L N="495">Th' imagin'd pomp of triumphs, gorgeous spoils,</L>
<L>And trains of shackled Greeks. The Spartan pierc'd</L>
<L>His shield, and bursting corselet. From the slain</L>
<L>The victor draws his iron-pointed spear</L>
<L>Bent, and infeebled with the forceful blow.</L>
<L N="500">Meantime within his buckler's verge, unseen</L>
<L>Amphistreus stealing in th' unguarded flank</L>
<L>His poniard struck. With swift effusion gush'd</L>
<L>A crimson torrent, but the scaly mail</L>
<L>Immediate death repell'd. Th' indignant king</L>
<L N="505">Gripes with resistless might the Persian's throat,</L>
<L>And drags him prostrate. None in Xerxes' court</L>
<L>Was more corrupt, with insolence more base,</L>
<L><PB N="323" REF="341"/>
With rancour more fallacious. Phrygia pin'd</L>
<L>Beneath th' oppression of his ruthless sway.</L>
<L N="510">Was there a field once fruitful, or a town</L>
<L>Once populous and rich? The horrid change</L>
<L>To want and desolation there declar'd,</L>
<L>The curs'd Amphistreus govern'd. As the spear</L>
<L>Of Tyrian Cadmus riveted to earth</L>
<L N="515">The pois'nous dragon, whose infectious breath</L>
<L>Had blasted half Boeotia; so the chief</L>
<L>Of Lacedaemon trampling on the neck</L>
<L>Of fall'n Amphistreus fixes to the rock</L>
<L>The gasping tyrant, and his broken lance</L>
<L N="520">Leaves in the panting corse. Meanwhile thy wound</L>
<L>Incessant flows, great hero, and augments</L>
<L>The hopes of Persia. Thou unyielding still</L>
<L>Sustain'st the contest, while unnumber'd darts</L>
<L>Are shiver'd on thy buckler, and thy feet</L>
<L N="525"><PB N="324" REF="342"/>
With glitt'ring points bestrew; the Cholchian sword,</L>
<L>And Persian dagger leave their shatter'd hilts;</L>
<L>Bent is the Caspian scymetar; in vain</L>
<L>The Sacian wheels his falchion, and their mace</L>
<L>The strong Chaldaeans and Assyrians raise:</L>
<L N="530">Thou stand'st unshaken, like a Thracian hill,</L>
<L>Like Rhodopé, or Haemus; where in vain</L>
<L>The thund'rer plants his livid bolt, in vain</L>
<L>The glancing lightning cleaves th' incrusted snow,</L>
<L>And Winter beating with eternal war</L>
<L N="535">Shakes from his dreery wings discordant storms,</L>
<L>Chill sleet, and clatt'ring hail. But now advanc'd</L>
<L>Abrocomes, and aim'd his deadly spear</L>
<L>Against the forehead of Laconia's chief,</L>
<L>Not unperceiv'd; the Spartan's active hand</L>
<L>His sword opposing upward rears the blade</L>
<L>Against the threatning javelin; o'er his crest</L>
<L><PB N="325" REF="343"/>
Its fury wastes in air, while swift descends</L>
<L>The pond'rous falchion on the Persian's knee:</L>
<L>At once the bone is sever'd; prone he falls;</L>
<L N="545">Crush'd on the ground beneath ten thousand feet</L>
<L>The gallant warriour breaths the last remains</L>
<L>Of tortur'd life. The Spartan thus maintain'd</L>
<L>Th' unequal combat with his single sword.</L>
<L>But Agis calls Diéneces, alarms</L>
<L N="550">Demophilus, Megistias; they from heaps</L>
<L>Of Allarodian and Sasperian slain</L>
<L>Haste to their leader, and before him raise</L>
<L>The brazen bulwark of their massy shields.</L>
<L>The foremost line of Asia stands and bleeds;</L>
<L N="555">The rest recoil: but Hyperanthes strides</L>
<L>From rank to rank throughout his various host,</L>
<L>Their dying hopes rekindles, in the brave</L>
<L>Excites new valour, and the freezing heart</L>
<L><PB N="326" REF="344"/>
Of Fear revives. Astaspes first obey'd</L>
<L N="560">The hero's voice, a fierce Chaldaean lord</L>
<L>Vain of his birth from antient Belus drawn,</L>
<L>Proud of his wealthy stores, and stately domes;</L>
<L>But now more proud by conquest, since his might</L>
<L>Had foil'd the strong Diomedon. He seeks</L>
<L N="565">The front of battle. His victorious mace</L>
<L>Against the brave Diéneces he bends;</L>
<L>The weighty blow bore down th' opposing shield,</L>
<L>And crush'd the Spartan's shoulder: idle hangs</L>
<L>The buckler now, and loads th' inactive arm</L>
<L N="570">Depriv'd of all its functions. Agis bares</L>
<L>His vengeful blade, and severs from the foe</L>
<L>His hand exalted for a second stroke.</L>
<L>The dying fingers with convulsive grasp</L>
<L>The falling mace infold. A Sacian chief</L>
<L N="575">Springs on the victor. Iäxartes' banks</L>
<L><PB N="327" REF="345"/>
To this brave savage gave his name and birth.</L>
<L>His looks erect, and fierce deportment spoke</L>
<L>A bold and gallant spirit, but untam'd,</L>
<L>With dreery wilds familiar, and a race</L>
<L N="580">Of rude Barbarians horrid as their clime.</L>
<L>The hostile spear, against his forehead aim'd,</L>
<L>Glanc'd upward, and o'erturn'd his iron cone:</L>
<L>The blow renew'd his bursting chest divides.</L>
<L>Th' undaunted Sacian writhes along the lance,</L>
<L N="585">Which griding passes through his breast and back,</L>
<L>A barbed arrow from his quiver draws,</L>
<L>Deep in the streaming pap of Agis hides</L>
<L>The deadly steel, then grimly smiles and dies.</L>
<L>From him Fate hastens to a nobler prey;</L>
<L N="590">For lo! the brave Diéneces presents</L>
<L>His breast obnoxious to a thousand darts.</L>
<L>The shield deserts his unsustaining arm,</L>
<L><PB N="328" REF="346"/>
And slides to earth. A grove of javelins rose</L>
<L>On his broad bosom. Still for ev'ry wound</L>
<L N="595">He hurl'd a Persian to th'infernal gloom;</L>
<L>But life at length forfook his riven heart,</L>
<L>And o'er the rock the gasping hero stretch'd</L>
<L>His dying limbs in gore. Who now can stand</L>
<L>The torrent of Barbarians? Agis bleeds,</L>
<L N="600">His spear is irrecoverably plung'd</L>
<L>In Iäxartes' body. Low reclines</L>
<L>Diéneces in gore. The Spartan chief</L>
<L>Himself o'erlabour'd, of his lance disarm'd</L>
<L>The rage of Death can exercise no more.</L>
<L N="605">One last and glorious effort age performs.</L>
<L>Demophilus, Megistias join their might,</L>
<L>And stem the floods of conquest; while the spear</L>
<L>Of slain Diéneces to Sparta's king</L>
<L>The fainting Agis bore. The blazing steel</L>
<L N="610"><PB N="329" REF="347"/>
In that dire hand again for battle rear'd</L>
<L>Blasts all the Persian valour. Back in heaps</L>
<L>They roll confounded, by their leader's voice</L>
<L>In vain exhorted longer to endure</L>
<L>The ceaseless waste of that unconquer'd arm.</L>
<L N="625">So, when the giants from Olympus chas'd</L>
<L>Th' inferiour Gods, themselves in terrour shun'd</L>
<L>Th' incessant streams of lightning, when the hand</L>
<L>Of heav'n's great father with eternal might</L>
<L>Sustain'd the direful conflict. O'er the field</L>
<L N="620">Awhile Bellona stills the rage of war;</L>
<L>When Thespia's leader, and Megistias drop</L>
<L>At either side of Lacedaemon's king.</L>
<L>Beneath the weight of years and labour bend</L>
<L>The hoary warriours. Not a groan molests</L>
<L N="625">Their parting spirits, but in death's calm night,</L>
<L>All-silent, bows each venerable head:</L>
<L><PB N="330" REF="348"/>
Like aged oaks, whose deep-descending roots</L>
<L>Had pierc'd resistless through the mountain's side,</L>
<L>And there for three long centuries had brav'd</L>
<L N="630">Each angry gust of Eurus, and the North;</L>
<L>Till, sapless now by Time's despoiling hand,</L>
<L>Without a blast their mossy trunks recline</L>
<L>Before their parent hill. By Sparta's chief</L>
<L>None now remains but Agis, who implores</L>
<L N="635">The last kind office from his godlike friend,</L>
<L>The Sacian's arrow from his pap to draw.</L>
<L>This done, life issues with the sanguine tide.</L>
<L>Thy comely features, Agis, now are pale;</L>
<L>Cold are thy graceful limbs, and dim thy eyes,</L>
<L N="640">Which now no more with placid beams reveal</L>
<L>The native virtues of thy gentle breast.</L>
<L>The noble corse Leonidas surveys.</L>
<L>Fate yields him one short interval of peace</L>
<L><PB N="331" REF="349"/>
To know how lovely are the patriot's wounds,</L>
<L N="645">And see those honours grace the man, he lov'd.</L>
<L>But Hyperanthes with his single spear</L>
<L>Forth from the trembling ranks of Asia tow'rs</L>
<L>His country's glory to redeem, or fall.</L>
<L>The Spartan worn by toil his languid arm</L>
<L N="650">Once more uplifting waits the dauntless prince.</L>
<L>The heroes now stood adverse. Each a while</L>
<L>Restrain'd his valour, and his godlike foe</L>
<L>Admiring view'd. Such majesty and strength</L>
<L>To fierce Pelides all incircled round</L>
<L N="655">With Trojan dead; and such to Priam's son</L>
<L>By struggling virtue, and by manly shame</L>
<L>From flight recall'd, great Homer's fancy gave.</L>
<L>O thou exalted o'er the laurel'd train</L>
<L>High, as the sweet Calliope is thron'd</L>
<L N="660">Above each vigin of the tuneful hill;</L>
<L><PB N="332" REF="350"/>
Now let one beam of thy celestial light</L>
<L>Dart through my lab'ring mind; lest Freedom mourn</L>
<L>Her chosen son dishonour'd in these strains!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW Hyperanthes, and Laconia's king</L>
<L N="665">With brandish'd points, and targets high uprear'd</L>
<L>Commence the fatal combat, which must close</L>
<L>The long-continu'd horrours of the day.</L>
<L>Fix'd with amaze and fear, the Asian files</L>
<L>Unmov'd and silent on their bucklers pause.</L>
<L N="670">Thus o'er th' expanse of India's wilds contend</L>
<L>The elephant, and horn'd rhinoceros;</L>
<L>Earth groans beneath them, as with wrath untam'd</L>
<L>Each hideous bulk in dire encounter meets:</L>
<L>With distant terrour gaze the savage throng.</L>
<L N="675">Prolong'd by varied art, the dubious fight</L>
<L>The great event suspended. On the foe</L>
<L><PB N="333" REF="351"/>
His well-aim'd spear at last the Spartan drove,</L>
<L>And pierc'd the shield. Inexorable fate</L>
<L>That moment hover'd o'er the eastern prince,</L>
<L N="680">When with unmatch'd celerity aside</L>
<L>He swung his buckler; underneath his arm,</L>
<L>Unstain'd with blood the hostile javelin pass'd:</L>
<L>Meantime, with joy, and ardent hopes elate</L>
<L>Of fame and conquest, sudden he impell'd</L>
<L N="685">His rapid lance against the Spartan's throat;</L>
<L>But he with wary skill his target rais'd,</L>
<L>And o'er his shoulder turn'd the glancing steel;</L>
<L>For one last effort then his scatter'd strength</L>
<L>Recall'd, and wheeling with resistless force</L>
<L N="690">His massy buckler dash'd the brazen verge</L>
<L>Against the Persian's forehead: down he sunk</L>
<L>Without a groan expiring, as o'erwhelm'd</L>
<L><PB N="334" REF="352"/>
Beneath a marble fragment from its seat</L>
<L>Heav'd by a whirlwind sweeping o'er the ridge</L>
<L N="695">Of some aspiring mansion. Gen'rous prince!</L>
<L>What could his valour more? His single might</L>
<L>He match'd with great Leonidas, and fell</L>
<L>Before his native bands. The Spartan chief</L>
<L>Now stands alone. In heaps his slaughter'd friends</L>
<L N="700">All stretch'd around him lie. The distant foes</L>
<L>Show'r on his head innumerable darts.</L>
<L>From various sluices gush the vital floods,</L>
<L>And stain his fainting limbs. Nor yet with pain</L>
<L>His brow is clouded, but those beauteous wounds,</L>
<L N="705">The sacred pledges of his own renown,</L>
<L>And Sparta's safety, with serenest joy</L>
<L>His closing eye contemplates. Fame can twine</L>
<L>No brighter laurels round his glorious head,</L>
<L><PB N="335" REF="353"/>
His virtue more to labour Fate forbids,</L>
<L N="710">And lays him now in honourable rest</L>
<L>To seal his country's liberty in death.</L>
