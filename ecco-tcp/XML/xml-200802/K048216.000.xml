<P>A DAY IN TURKEY; OR, THE RUSSIAN SLAVES.</P>
<P>A COMEDY, AS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, IN COVENT GARDEN.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>HINTS have been thrown out, and the idea in∣dustriously circulated, that the following comedy is tainted with POLITICS. I protest I know nothing about politics;—will Miss Wolstonecraft forgive me—whose book contains such a body of mind as I hardly ever met with—if I say that politics are <HI>unfe∣minine?</HI> I never in my life could attend to their discussion.</P>
<P>TRUE COMEDY has always been defined to be a picture of life—a record of passing manners—a mirror to reflect to succeeding times the characters and follies of the present. How then could I, pretending to be a comic poet, bring an emigrant Frenchman before
<PB REF="3"/>
the public at this day, and not make him hint at the events which had just passed, or were then passing in his native country? A character so written would have been anomalous—the critics ought to have had no mercy on me. It is A LA GREQUE who speaks, not <HI>I</HI>; nor can I be accountable for <HI>his</HI> sentiments. <HI>Such</HI> is my idea of tracing CHARACTER; and were I to continue to write for the stage, I should always govern myself by it.</P>
<P>THE illiberal and <HI>false</HI> suggestions concerning the politics of the comedy I could frankly forgive, had they not deprived it of the honour of a COMMAND. The passages on which those misrepresentations were built, were on the second night omitted, but imme∣diately afterwards restored; and the DAY IN TURKEY leaves the press exactly as it has continued to be performed amidst the most vivid and uninter∣rupted plaudits—or interrupted only by the glitter of soft tears; a species of applause not less flattering than the spontaneous laugh, or the voluntary collision of hands.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>SOME of the performers in this comedy have play'd so transcendently well, that their names deserve to be recorded; but to particularise any, when <HI>all</HI> have aim'd at perfection, would be invidious.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SPOKEN BY MR. HARLEY.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>NOT from the present moment springs our play,</L>
<L>Th' events which gave it birth are past away—</L>
<L>Five glowing moons have chas'd night's shades from earth,</L>
<L>Since the war fled which gave our Drama birth.</L>
<L>"<HI>Not smiling peace o'er</HI> RUSSIA's <HI>wide-spread land</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Wav'd gently</HI> then, <HI>her sceptre of command.</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>No! thousands rush'd at red ambition's call,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>With mad'ning rage to triumph—or to fall.</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>'Twas then our female bard from</HI> BRITAIN'S <HI>shore</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Was led by fancy to the distant roar</HI>"—</L>
<L>'Twas then she saw sweet virgins captives made,</L>
<L>'Twas then she saw the cheek of beauty fade,</L>
<L>Whilst the proud soldier in ignoble chains,</L>
<L>Was from his country dragg'd to hostile plains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus was her bold imagination fired</L>
<L>When battle with its horrid train retired;</L>
<L>Yet, sure the story which she then combin'd,</L>
<L>Should not to drear oblivion be resign'd—</L>
<L>No—let it still your various passions raise,</L>
<L>And to have touch'd them, oft', has been her praise:</L>
<L>Trusting to candour, she solicits here,</L>
<L>Your smile of pleasure, or your pity's tear;</L>
<L>For tho' the <HI>time</HI> is past, the FEELING true,</L>
<L>She dedicates to NATURE, and to YOU!</L>

Brother—father—come! We are driven from our cottage; we have no longer a home—let us run some where to seek another.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come father lean on me, and let us walk faster, or we shall be pick'd up by some of the turban'd gentry.
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
They are out a foraging; and they always consider christians as useful cattle. Let us fly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FATHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fly! alas, with the load of seventy years upon my shoulders, how hard a task! We shall never escape them, child—Thou'lt see thy father murdered, and worse luck than that will be thy fate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worse luck than to be murdered! I should be glad to see the day—What worse <HI>can</HI> happen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD MAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou'lt be made a slave,—slave to a Turk
<STAGE>[CRIES]</STAGE>
—I shall see thee in a vile Turk's se∣raglio, no better, as it were, than the handmaid of a Jew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I may out-live such a misfortune as that; but I never heard of out-living a throat cut—So, dear father, cheer up, and let us hurry on to the next village. Peter, take care of that bag—for it contains all we have in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; and if it hadn't been for some of our own soldiers, I had been a lost man—They were so kind as to strip our cottage yesterday, and left us no more than I can very <HI>conveniently</HI> move under.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and more than all that, they took away my very best gown, and my new fur cap!
<STAGE>[cry∣ing]</STAGE>
yes; and he who took them said it was in friend∣ship, for that otherwise my very best gown and cap would certainly fall into the hands of the enemy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; it was truly a very friendly action, and they perform'd it like gentlemen—No words, but their very looks were oaths, and the black eyebrows of one of them spoke louder curses than I ever heard between fifty Siberian boar-hunters
<STAGE>[clashing of swords without.]</STAGE>
There—there! d'ye hear? Our friends are coming
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
down upon us; and our enemies are at hand! Come, let us run

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>There it goes—There it goes! Nothing can save thee, my gallant master—This comes of your reconnoitering—Had you not better have been in your tent, quietly breaking your <HI>fast,</HI> than here, breaking the heads of the Turks—So, now he's disarm'd—Well, nobody bid ye—'tis all your own fault—Now, how comely he looks with his arms folded, and his sword in the hands of that beetle-brow'd Turk! Pardie! I feel now as great a man as my master.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MULEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Courageous Russian, thou art ours! Could valour have saved thee, captivity and you had never met —Your empress, we trust, has not many such soldiers in the neighbouring camp.—Come, droop not, Sir, this is the fortune of war.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORLOFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had I been made your prisoner, whilst on a post of duty, I could have borne my lot—A soldier can support not only death, but even slavery, when a sense of duty gives <HI>dignity</HI> to his chains; but <HI>my</HI> chains are base ones, for I reconnoiter'd without command, and have lost my liberty without glory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then <HI>I</HI> have lost my liberty too without glory, for I <HI>attended</HI> you without command, and now— Oh, <HI>le diable!</HI> I am valet de chambre to a slave!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TURK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let not that affect thee! The fortune of war, which has wounded your master's pride, ought to

elate yours, for you are now his equal—both slaves alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Eagerly.]</STAGE>
Are we so? And has he no farther right to command me, nor threaten me? Kind Sir, tell me but that—tell me but that —!</P>

<P>Scoundrel!
<STAGE>[Throws up the box with his arm.]</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no hard names—let us be civil to each other, as brother slaves ought to be—And now I think of it—Hark ye! I suppose your slaves take rank according to their usefulness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TURK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, my master—I mean that man there, who was my master, can do no earthly thing but fight, whilst I, on the contrary, am expert at several.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MULEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your qualifications?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are innumerable—I can sing you pretty little French airs, and Italian canzonettas—No man in Paris, Sir—for I have the honor to be a French∣man—No man in Paris understands the science of the powder-puff better than myself—I can frize you in a taste beyond—Oh, what you are all CROPS, I see—fore fronts, and back fronts—Oh, those vile turbans, my genius will be lost amongst you, and a frizeur will be of no more use than an oyster-woman.—Why, you look as though you had all been scalp'd, and cover'd your crowns with your pillows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>TURK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Christian, our turbans are too elevated a subject for your sport.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir,
<STAGE>[pointing to his turban, and then to the ground]</STAGE>
drop the subject, it will be a proof of national taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MULEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy speech is licentious and empty; but in a Frenchman we can pardon it—'tis <HI>national Taste</HI>— However, if your boasted qualifications end here, it is probable, you will be a slave as little distinguish'd as your master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardonnez moi! I can do things he never thought of—You have heard the story of the basket-maker amongst savages? I do not despair of seeing my master my servant yet—Courage, Monsieur Ie Compte! I'll treat you with great condescension, de∣pend on't, and endeavour to make you forget in all things the distance between us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MULEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He seems too deeply absorb'd in melan∣choly, to be roused by thy impertinence!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor young man! Times are alter'd, to be sure; and at present he's a little down in the mouth; but he's fond of music, cheer him with a Turkish air— Helas! all the <HI>air</HI> we have will be Turkish now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORLOFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah no! forbear your music, and bring me your chains! Drag me to your dungeons! The in∣tellectual bitterness of this moment cannot be increased by <HI>outward</HI> circumstance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chains and dungeons! Why sure the ghost of our dead bastille has not found its way hither— Hey, Messieurs! Have you lantern posts too, and hanging Marquisses in this country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORLOFF.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[angrily.]</STAGE>
Peace!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace! That's a bold demand.—Your Empress can't find it at the head of a hundred thousand men, and the most sublime Grand Signior is obliged to put on his night-cap without it, though he has a million of these pretty Gentlemen to assist him—Besides, Eng∣land has engross'd the commodity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORLOFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Sir, let us not loiter here—I would have my fate determined, and my misery compleat. Alas! is it not already so? Yes, my heart has been long the property of sorrow, and it will never relinquish its claims.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MULEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall lead you to the palace of the Bassa Ibrahim—it is in the neighbourhood of yonder camp which he commands, what your fate may then be, his humour determines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I hope we shall catch him in a <HI>good</HI> humour, and what care I whether a Turk or a Ruffian has the honor to be my master? Now you see the misfortune of being born a Count! Had he lost no more than I have, he'd be as careless as I am—Come, brother slave—no ceremony, no ceremony, I beg.</P>

<P>A pretty girl faith, and daughter to one of our great Russian boyards—a boyard ranks as a mar∣quis did in France, and as a laird still does in Scotland —I love to elucidate.</P>

<P>Well!</P>

<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the very thing he would get at. —Ma'am and he were walking like two doves in the boyard's garden, which garden was border'd by trees, which trees were border'd by the sea—Out springs from the wood forty Turks with forty sabres, and forty pair of great monstrous whiskers, which so frighten'd the bride, that, instead of running away, she fainted away, and staid there.</P>

<P>Hah, hah! then my countrymen had a prize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they had, worth two Jew's eyes. Six of them hurried off with her to a Felucca, which lay at the edge of the wood; and all the rest employ'd my master. I suppose they would have had him too, but the boyard, with a large party of friends, appearing at the top of a walk, they thought fit to make off with what they had.—Well, my master's bridal bed was, that night, the beach, where he staid raving and beat∣ing himself, as tho' he took himself for one of the Turk∣ish ravishers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AZIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! thy story is well—so, all that night, he walk'd in the garden—Oh, and the night∣ingales, I warrant, sung responses to his complaints, and the melancholy wood dove cooed in sympathetic sorrow.—It must have been very pleasant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, a pleasant night as could be; but it cost him a fortnight's lying in bed; for a hissing hot fever laid hold of him; and the doctors, with all their rank and file of phials and bolusses, could hardly drive him out of his veins.</P>

<P>How should I know?

My vows! ah, my Orloff, a beam of radiance once more breaks in on my afflicted soul. I have never <HI>seen</HI> the Bassa—Nay, look not thus incredulous—this dungeon proves it— I am a prisoner here as well as you, and was this day brought hither.</P>

Oh fate, spare me a moment! Scarcely dare I give way to the overpower∣ing thought! yet it must be so! It was not thee, <HI>my heaven!</HI> whom I beheld in Ibrahim's arms—No, it was another, and Alexina's pure!</P>
