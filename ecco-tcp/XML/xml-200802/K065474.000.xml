<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GAther up the Fragments that remain, that nothing be Lost,</HI> John 6. 12. Was the direction of our <HI>Saviour</HI> to his <HI>Disciples,</HI> after he had fed the Mul∣titude. Which may well and usefully be applied, to the Collecting and Pre∣serving the Accounts of the <HI>Lives</HI> of <HI>Good Men: Men</HI> who in their Day, have been eminently useful in those Stations of Life, wherein <HI>God,</HI> by his good <HI>Providence,</HI> hath placed them. And this preserving, by <HI>Publication,</HI> is the rather to be done, when themselves do leave behind them, in Writing, an <HI>Ac∣count</HI> of their <HI>Lives,</HI> and of the <HI>signal Mercies of God</HI> to them therein: For
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
from such <HI>Accounts,</HI> may best be gather∣ed, by the <HI>Reader,</HI> the Man's <HI>particular State, Exercise</HI> and <HI>Growth</HI> in the <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Restoration,</HI> out of the <HI>Fall</HI> and <HI>Dege∣neracy:</HI> And, in the Reading thereof, be not only excited to <HI>Bless the Name of the Lord,</HI> on his behalf; but also gain some direction from the <HI>Path,</HI> so fairly tract out, and ground of <HI>Hope;</HI> that by be∣ing <HI>Faithful,</HI> they may likewise attain to the same good <HI>Experience.</HI></P>
<P>There is not with me any doubt, but something of this kind may be the Lot of many, into whose Hands this <HI>Treatise</HI> may happen to come; for that they will herein meet with variety of <HI>Exercises,</HI> and the <HI>Providences</HI> of God therein, all related with great strength and plainness of Speech: Our <HI>Deceased</HI> Friend <HI>Thomas Ellwood,</HI> having been a Man whom God had endued with <HI>singular Abilities,</HI> both as a <HI>Man,</HI> and as a <HI>Christian;</HI> which is e∣vident, not only from this short Account of his <HI>Life,</HI> which was written by him∣self, and by the <HI>Supplement</HI> added here∣unto;
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
but more largely from his many useful Labours and Services in the ma∣ny Books which he writ in the Defence of <HI>Truth,</HI> and the <HI>Friends</HI> thereof: For which <HI>Service</HI> he was in a particular manner qualified, by <HI>Spiritual Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Christian Obedience;</HI> to which, in him, was added great strength and depth of <HI>Judgment,</HI> wherein he could discern the Spirits of others, and was very much the Master of his own, as did appear to such who knew him, not only by the soundness of his <HI>Reasoning,</HI> and the Sea∣sonableness of his <HI>Words;</HI> but also by his great and exemplary <HI>Modesty,</HI> in that he was not hasty to <HI>propose,</HI> nor rudely tenacious to insist on what he had proposed; if any thing, though not well exprest, yet well intended, was offered by any one much Weaker; nay, though but by a <HI>Babe</HI> in <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Countenance</HI> was Manly and Chear∣ful; His <HI>Deportment</HI> Grave, yet Affable and Courteous, even to the meanest Per∣son; His Conversation Innocent, Pleasant
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
and Instructive, yet severe against any thing that was beyond the Liberty of <HI>Truth.</HI> These, with his other Qualifica∣tions of <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Mind,</HI> did render him both very Acceptable and very Useful, as a <HI>Friend,</HI> as a <HI>Neighbour,</HI> and as a <HI>Member</HI> and <HI>Elder</HI> in the <HI>Church of Christ;</HI> and the more, for that his Time was chiefly Imployed in being Service∣able in one or other of these <HI>Capacities.</HI></P>
<P>I might here particularly mention the several <HI>Labours</HI> of our <HI>Deceased Friend,</HI> according to their respective Times, and the Nature of their several Subjects; but much of this being already done in the ensuing Pages, I chuse to remit the <HI>Reader</HI> thither; by which possibly he may be excited to the Perusal of them, and shall only say concerning them, <HI>that the Judicious Reader will easily Observe, that his Method and Stile do denote him to have been a Scholar: And yet not farther so, than the Simplicity and Purity of the</HI> Truth, <HI>whereof he made Profession, would permit him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
I was with our Friend <HI>Thomas Ell∣wood,</HI> the greater part of his <HI>Sickness:</HI> In which he was also very frequently visit∣ed by our Friend <HI>George Bowles,</HI> who was his Neighbour; to whom therefore I refer, for the Account which he may give of his <HI>Sickness</HI> and <HI>Dying Words.</HI></P>
<P>As it was my good Lot to be well acquainted with him (though only in the latter Years of his Life) and know that he did neither use nor encourage the bestowing Elaborate <HI>Encomiums</HI> up∣on Persons Deceased: So neither shall I add further concerning him, than to say with the <HI>Apostle</HI> concern∣ing the Faithful, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 4.</NOTE><HI>That he was Righteous, God Testifying of his Gifts; and by it being Dead, yet Speaketh.</HI></P>

<HEAD>George Bowles <HI>his</HI> TESTIMONY <HI>Concerning</HI> Thomas Ellwood.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is in my Heart briefly, on this Occasion, to com∣memorate the <HI>tender Dealings</HI> of the Lord with his People in this latter Age of the World, when it hath pleased him, in Love to poor lost Man, graci∣ously to appear, by the breaking forth of his <HI>Glorious Gospel Day.</HI> And by the secret divine Reaches of the Hand of God, which hath been felt and seen in the Light of it, many have been drawn in their Spi∣rits to seek after the Lord, and to enquire after the Knowledge of the Way of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Salvation;</HI> and blessed be his Holy Name, who was graciously pleased, by the Inshinings of this <HI>Divine Light</HI> in the Hearts of many, to expel the <HI>Darkness</HI> and rend the <HI>Vail.</HI> And then was the Arm of his mighty Power made bare, for the gathering many Thousands to the sav∣ing <HI>Knowledge of Himself.</HI> And in that Day was the Lord pleased according to his Promise, to <HI>pour forth of his Spirit upon Sons and upon Daugh∣ters;</HI> yea, upon Servants and upon Handmaids, and many were made to Prophesie; and being qua∣lified by the Holy Spirit, which they received, and were baptized by it into his Name, became willing, and were freely given up in Obedience to the Lord, and in Bowels of tender Love to the Souls of Man∣kind, in his Power, to preach the Gospel of Life and Salvation to those to whom they were sent, and ma∣ny
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
were turned from <HI>Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</HI> by their Ministry: Amongst whom our dear deceased Friend and Bro∣ther, <HI>THOMAS ELLWOOD,</HI> was one, whose Con∣science was reached and awakened by the Powerful Ministry of dear <HI>Edward Burrough,</HI> as I have heard him relate (and as by the following Sheets will more plainly appear.) And of that Day and Time, and the worthy Instrument by whose Ministry he was Con∣vinced, and turned unto God, and made sensible of the <HI>Divine Principle</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> in his own Heart, have I heard him speak with great Regard; and also of the Sufferings which did attend him after he received the Truth in his Father's Family, for the Truth's sake: and how the Lord preserved him in that time, under the various Exercises, which he passed through for Truth's Testimony; which for Christ's sake he was Conscientiously Concerned to stand in, according to that Plainness and Simplici∣ty which Truth then led, and still continues to lead the sincere Disciples of Christ into, by which they were distinguished from the World; and, for the sake thereof, they were despised of Men, and hated of the World. Such was the Plain Langu∣age of <HI>Thou</HI> to one, and refusing the <HI>Hat-Ho∣nour;</HI> For which, Dear <HI>T. E.</HI> suffered not a lit∣tle in that Day, as, by the following Account of his Life more fully appears. And it were well if all, who come up in a Profession of the Blessed Truth in this Time, were Faithful in these, and in the other Branches of its Testimony. And let all con∣sider, that the neglecting thereof, is, in a Degree,
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
a making void the Sufferings of the Faithful (and strengthening the Hands of Evil Doers) who for the sake of their <HI>Testimony, loved not their Lives to the Death;</HI> but underwent cruel <HI>Mock∣ings, Buffetings, Stonings, Whippings, Stock∣ings, Revilings, Imprisonments,</HI> and <HI>Spoiling of Goods;</HI> Rejoycing in the Lord, that they were counted worthy to Suffer, either less or more, for his Name sake. In respect of which, this my dear <HI>Friend</HI> was a good Example, he being a Man of a steady <HI>Mind,</HI> and very patient in <HI>Suffering,</HI> as well as Faithful in his Testimony for <HI>Truth,</HI> and took joyfully the Spoiling of his <HI>Goods,</HI> wherein he was tryed but a few Years before his Death. He was often Concerned in Defence of Truth's Testimony, both against our Professed <HI>Adversaries,</HI> and also against the <HI>Libertine Spirit</HI> which appeared in some, Professing the same Truth with us, who Op∣posed themselves against that good Order and Disci∣pline which the <HI>Truth</HI> led <HI>Friends</HI> into. All which will abundantly appear from the Books themselves, which are in Print, which he writ upon <HI>Various Occasions,</HI> and upon <HI>Divers Subjects;</HI> and let not his great Labour and Industry be Forgotten, in his writing those Two Historical Volumes, relating to the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Testament:</HI> A Work truly Great, and is, and may be of great Use and Ser∣vice. By all which his many Labours, it may be perceived by the wary and inlightned <HI>Reader,</HI> that the Lord had Endowed him with an excellent Gift, and Qualified him for the Service of Truth, his Church and People; in which he imployed the Ta∣lent
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
which the bountiful Lord had given him, to the Honour of the great Giver, and to the Com∣fort and Edification of the Church of Christ: But more especially were his Services known to the <HI>Bre∣thren</HI> in this County of <HI>Bucks;</HI> Most of which are fallen asleep, and but few remaining here, who knew him in his beginning, or his first Services for the Lord, his Church and People; amongst whom he was a Zealous Asserter of that excellent Disci∣pline the Lord had opened in, and led his People to, for the preserving his Church as a Garden en∣closed: for which cause how did many of those <HI>Liber∣tines</HI> set themselves fiercely against him, and shot their Arrows at him; but the Lord Defended him, and covered his Head in the <HI>Day of Battle, and his Bow abode in Strength, and his Bough spread over the Wall, and continued fresh and green:</HI> But a Blast from the Lord came upon their Evil Work; And how have they melted away? And how is their Strength failed, and their Work brought to Naught? But the Blessing of the Lord is with his People, even with the Faithful, to this Day, whom he hath preserved as a peculiar Trea∣sure to himself: Blessed be his Holy Name for ever∣more. And furthermore, it may be truly said of this our dear Friend, that as the Lord fitted him for his Service, so was he eminently serviceable in his Hand, in the Church of Christ; particularly in these Parts, of which there are many Living Witnesses, in this and the adjacent Counties, of his great Labour of Love, having served the Church Freely, with great Diligence and Faithfulness: The true sense of which,

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucheth me and others, with the deeper sense of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat Loss, the Church hath by his Removal; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing also sensible through the Lord's Goodness, that ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Loss</HI> is his <HI>Eternal Gain,</HI> I feel in my Heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n humble Submission to the Will of him, who doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hatsoever pleaseth him, both in Heaven and in Earth; and who shall say unto him, <HI>What doest thou?</HI> And it is the tender breathing of my Spi∣rit to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he would be graciously pleased, in Pity and Compassion to his poor People, to raise up, fit and furnish more faithful Servants for his Work and Service, and make them Zealous for his Name and Truth upon the Earth, that the place of this my Dear <HI>Friend,</HI> and other Faithful Servants of the Lord and his People, of late removed from amongst us in these Parts, may be supplied; and that the Spouse of Christ may, amidst all her Tribulations, Afflictions and sore Exercises, be made to Praise the Lord, and Bless his Holy Name, who taketh away one, and raiseth up another, and Blesseth his Children with his Goodness; according to his Pro∣mise made of Old, by the Holy Prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> 44. <HI>ver.</HI> 3. saying, <HI>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Blessing upon thine Off-spring.</HI> And thus hath the Lord preserved <HI>Zion</HI> from Age to Age: And I doubt not, but am fully perswaded, that he will still Bless his People, and Preserve <HI>Zion,</HI> and Deliver her from all her Enemies.</P>
<P>And my Dear <HI>Friends, Brethren,</HI> and <HI>Sisters,</HI> although it be matter of Sorrow to us, to part with our Dear <HI>Friends;</HI> especially such as have been
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
made Serviceable in their Day, and have faith∣fully served the Lord and his People in their Ge∣neration, as it may (I hope without just occasion of Offence to any) be said of dear <HI>T. E.</HI> that he was a Man who served the Lord in <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> and his People with <HI>Chearfulness,</HI> and his Neighbours with <HI>Uprightness</HI> and <HI>Integrity:</HI> And therefore both they and we have the greater Loss; Yet may we not sorrow unseasonably, as those which sorrow without Hope, but, believing that the Lord hath taken him to himself in Mercy (though it may be in Judgment, to some who were unworthy) let us all learn Resignation to his blessed Will, and say with Holy <HI>Job, The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away: Blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI> And dear Friends, I may farther signifie unto you, that it being my Lot to be with this our dear Friend (of whom I am speaking) almost every day of his last Ilness, I did observe in him, to my great Comfort and Satisfaction, a quiet composed Frame of Mind and Spirit, and Resignation to the Will of God. When I came first to him, which was soon after I heard of his being taken ill, which was the 24th day of the 2d Month, I found him very much dis∣abled by the <HI>Distemper,</HI> which was thought to be a <HI>Palsie,</HI> that had seized him, especially on his right Side, so that he could not stand alone, nor help himself, but a little with his left Hand; and his Speech was also very much interrupted, insomuch that it was with great difficulty, for the most part, that he expressed himself so as to be Understood: Some time after I came to him, there being also other
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iends</HI> with him, we sate down together under a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighty Exercise of Spirit, waiting upon the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deep Silence, with our Eye to him, it pleased the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord eminently to appear amongst us, and to fill our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earts with the refreshing Streams of his Divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove, and to open the Mouth of one of us in Prayer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Supplication; and the Lord was graciously Pleas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d abundantly to replenish our Spirits, to our mutu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Comfort, in a Living Sense of Divine Goodness; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd this our <HI>Dear Friend,</HI> expressed himself in great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enderness and Brokenness of Spirit, on this wise, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> am sensibly Comforted and Refreshed in this Visit.</HI> And that Afternoon, he, fixing his Eyes upon me, with great Earnestness of Spirit, expressed, as well as he could at that time, a great Concern that was upon his Mind for <HI>Truth,</HI> and the <HI>Friends</HI> of it, in divers Particulars; especially, in Re∣lation to our own <HI>Monthly</HI> and <HI>Quarterly-Meet∣ings,</HI> the <HI>Writings</HI> of both which, had been un∣der his Care for more than Fourty Years: After which, he was much eased in his Spirit, and so continued to the last, so far as I perceived; often saying, when asked how he did, <HI>I am easie, I am quiet.</HI> And he was often very tender in his Spirit, expressing his Resignation to the Will of God, whether in Life or Death, saying, <HI>If the Lord hath no more Work for me to do, I am con∣tent and resigned to his Will; and my hearty Farewel to all my Brethren.</HI> And at another time, nearer his End, he said to us present, in much Brokenness of Heart, <HI>I am full of Joy and Peace, my Spirit is filled with Joy;</HI> or to this Effect:
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
for by reason that his Speech was so weakned, sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things could not be so well collected, which he at time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spake, in a tender sense of the Lord's Goodness: th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sense of which deeply affected some of as who were with him. And my Heart is sorrowfully affected at this time, in a sense of the great Loss which the Church of Christ (in these Parts especially) hath by his Removal: But in this I am comforted, in a living sense of the Lord's Mercy and Goodness to∣wards him, in carrying him through his Affliction in great Patience and Quietness; under which he was sweetly refreshed, by the Streams of Divine Love, and his Cup was often made to overflow: And we, who were present, being touched with a Sense there∣of, were comforted therein, being in a Travail of Spirit for him, and did in our Measures truly sym∣pathize with him under his Affliction. And I am fully satisfied, he laid down his Head in Peace with the Lord, and is gathered to his everlasting Rest. He departed this Life the 1<HI>st</HI> of the 3<HI>d Month,</HI> 1713. about the 2d Hour in the Morning, in the 74th Year of his Age. He received the Truth in the Year 1659, and lived in Fellowship with the <HI>Friends</HI> of it about 53 Years. And I think it may be truly said of him, That as he <HI>Lived</HI> so he <HI>Died,</HI> the <HI>Servant of the LORD</HI> and <HI>His People,</HI> and hath left a sweet Savour behind him, and his <HI>Memory</HI> is blessed with the <HI>Righte∣ous</HI> for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>THAT the Dead which <HI>Die in the Lord,</HI> are Blessed of him, we have great Assurance of, from <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Divine</HI> his writing to the Seven <HI>Churches,</HI> Rev. 14. ver. 13. Where he tells them, that he <HI>Heard a Voice from Heaven, saying, Write, Bles∣sed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from hence∣forth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may Rest from their Labours; and their Works do follow them.</HI> Of which Number, we have no Cause to doubt, but this our dear friend is one; who was eminently Service∣able in the Church of Christ. A Man to whom the Lord had given a large Capacity beyond many, and furnished him with an excellent Gift; whereby he was qualified for those Services in the Church, in the performance of which, he did shine as a <HI>Star,</HI> which received its Luster and Brightness from the Glorious <HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Righ∣teousness.</HI> He was Wise, but Humble; Condescending to the Weak, and ready to Help, where he saw and felt Sincerity; but Sharp to that which he apprehended to be Insincere and Deceitful; for which Cause, he was not acceptable to Hypocrites and Disorderly Wal∣kers: Yet he was a Man of a very acceptable and a∣greeable Conversation, as well as Sober and Religious, both in the Church and in the World, being of a free

Our Loss is great by his Removal: But in this we are satisfied, that it is his Everlasting Gain; being gathered, as we have good Cause to Believe, to his Eternal Rest. The knowledge we had of him, and the good Account which we have received of him, in the time of his last Il∣ness, by those who were most constantly with him, and of his quiet and peaceable Departure, doth sensi∣bly Engage our Hearts to acquiesce in the Will of the Lord; and therein we have Peace and Comfort.

The <HI>Monthly-Meeting</HI> was held at his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse about Forty Years, and he always look'd very kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Courteous on <HI>Friends,</HI> when they came there, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok Care and Notice of the <HI>Meanest,</HI> who came in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncerity.</HI> He was Zealous for <HI>Good Order,</HI> and a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst such, who, being in an <HI>Apostatized Spirit, Op∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed it;</HI> and may well be numbred amongst the <HI>Wor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies,</HI> whose Names are upon Record for their <HI>Valour;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is this our <HI>Friend</HI> worthy to be; who never turned his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck on such who <HI>Opposed</HI> the <HI>Truth;</HI> but stood his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>round,</HI> as his <HI>Printed Sheets</HI> on such occasions do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w.

Engaged to set forth how Kind and Condescending he was to the <HI>Weakest Capacity,</HI> and would help out when they wanted a <HI>Word</HI>) that Generations to come may learn how good it is to <HI>forsake All,</HI> and <HI>follow Christ Jesus,</HI> as this our <HI>Friend</HI> did, and the <HI>Account</HI> of his <HI>Life,</HI> following, shews; who not only <HI>Gives Wisdom,</HI> but <HI>Teacheth Humility</HI> also.</P>
<P>He was greatly respected by his Neighbours, for his Services amongst them; his Heart and Doors were open to the <HI>Poor,</HI> both <HI>Sick</HI> and <HI>Lame,</HI> who wanted <HI>Help,</HI> and had it freely, taking Care to provide things useful for such <HI>Occasions,</HI> (blest also with good <HI>Suc∣cess</HI>) often saying, <HI>He mattered not what Cost he was at, to do Good.</HI> Such Lament their <HI>Loss;</HI> what then may we do, who miss him in an <HI>Higher Station,</HI> in his great Service in the <HI>Church of Christ,</HI> but even desire to be resigned to the <HI>Will of the Lord?</HI> who Preserved him through all his <HI>Hardships,</HI> to a <HI>Domi∣nion</HI> over <HI>False Brethren,</HI> and is now out of their Reach, and of <HI>Temptation</HI> too; on whose Head, the <HI>Bles∣sing,</HI> ask'd for <HI>Joseph,</HI> rests; who as a Fruitful <HI>Bough</HI> his <HI>Branch</HI> spreads over the <HI>Wall</HI> of <HI>Opposi∣tion,</HI> and <HI>his Bow abode in Strength; the Hands of whose Arms were made Strong, by the help of the Mighty God of</HI> Jacob, to whom be the <HI>Glory</HI> for what he hath wrought in our Day, whose own Works <HI>Praise him</HI> for Evermore. And the Tears of <HI>Sor∣row</HI> that we shed, for the Loss of this our Deceased <HI>Friend,</HI> let them be remembred to bow our Spirits each of us, into a <HI>Godly Care,</HI> that we may com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up according to our several <HI>Capacities,</HI> to follow th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord <HI>Faithfully,</HI> in a <HI>Godly Zeal</HI> for his <HI>Honour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and so come to lay down our Heads in <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Peac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as this our <HI>Friend</HI> expressed he did.</P>
<P>This Eminent Servant of Christ, was Early Convin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ed of the Way of <HI>Truth,</HI> wherein he continued to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> finishing of his Days; for the sake of which, he soo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

became a <HI>Sufferer;</HI> not only by <HI>Imprisonment,</HI> for <HI>Worshipping God</HI> in the Assemblies of his People, but also, from his <HI>Father,</HI> by whom he was made as an <HI>Outcast,</HI> for no other Cause, but for his Faithful <HI>Testimony</HI> in taking up the <HI>Cross</HI> to the <HI>Worlds Be∣haviour</HI> and <HI>Language:</HI> Whereupon he was Invited by his much valued Friend <HI>Isaac Penington,</HI> to his House; where he abode several Years, until he <HI>Mar∣ried.</HI> He was a Blessing in, as well as a great Com∣fort and Help to that <HI>Family;</HI> and by his wise Conduct therein, gained much <HI>Esteem,</HI> not only from the <HI>El∣ders,</HI> but the <HI>Youth,</HI> whom he Instructed in <HI>Learn∣ing;</HI> and though most of them are by <HI>Death</HI> Removed, yet One still Remains, who from Certain and Experi∣mental Knowledge, can Commemorate his <HI>Worth;</HI> being engaged thereto, from a Sense of the <HI>Benefit</HI> of his Good and Wholsom <HI>Advice,</HI> given at <HI>Sundry Times,</HI> and on <HI>Divers Occasions.</HI> Which Friendship continued firm to the Last.</P>
<P>His <HI>Natural Capacity</HI> was large, and his <HI>Under∣standing,</HI> in the <HI>things of God,</HI> very deep; which excellent Qualifications meeting in one, rendred him useful beyond many, to his <HI>Country,</HI> as well as very ser∣viceable in the <HI>Church;</HI> by both which he is, and will be greatly missed. But he is gone to his Grave in a full Age, and <HI>gathered as a shock of Corn in its Sea∣son, having done his Days Work Faithfully:</HI> So that saying may be verified in him, <HI>The END Crowns all.</HI></P>
<P>His Sickness was sudden, which soon deprived him of the use of his <HI>Limbs,</HI> yet he retained the Faculties of his Inward and Outward <HI>Senses</HI> clear all along; and notwithstanding, at times, his Pains were Great; his Exemplary <HI>Patience,</HI> and Composed Resignation, was remarkably apparent to those that Visited and Attended him; so that their Sorrow in parting with so dear a Friend, was intermixed with Comfort in be∣holding
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
the Heavenly Frame of Mind wherewith he was Adorned.</P>
<P>Thus after all his Labours, he entred into <HI>Everlast∣ing Rest,</HI> and left many behind <HI>Weeping,</HI> though not without Hope, that they shall again meet at the <HI>General Assembly of Saints,</HI> where the redeemed shall sing <HI>Praises</HI> to their blessed <HI>Redeemer,</HI> whose Right it is to Reign for ever.</P>
<P>We have this farther to add, namely, That our Esteem of him was great, because of that real worth that was in him, through the Operation of the mighty Power of the Lord that separated him from the <HI>Love</HI> of the <HI>World:</HI> So that he chose (with <HI>Moses</HI>) rather to <HI>suffer Affliction with the People of God, than to en∣joy the Pleasures of Sin for a Season,</HI> and it pleased the Lord to fit him with Wisdom and Counsel, so that he was made able to give Judgment in difficult Cases, where∣in many of us have particularly received Benefit, and therefore have cause to lament the loss we have by his Removal. And Oh! say our Souls, That the Lord would raise up many more in his Room, to the Praise and Hon∣our of the good <HI>Husbandman.</HI> And it is our Desire that we, who are yet behind, may be made able so to Steer our Course, through this troublesome World, that when our End comes, we may lay down our Heads in Peace with the Lord, and leave a good Savour behind us, as this our Friend hath done.</P>
<P>This is written in true Love and Respect, to the Me∣mory of our Deceased <HI>Friend,</HI> as it pleased the Lord, to move upon our Hearts. And being read and approv∣ed in our <HI>Womens-Meeting</HI> at <HI>Hungerhill,</HI> the 4<HI>th</HI> of the 11th Month, 1713. was subscribed in behalf of the said Meeting by us,</P>

And altho' he was endowed with Parts and Accomplishment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above many, he was Humble and Grave; not Self-seek¦ing, but esteeming the Power of Truth, tho' it did appear through mean Instruments.

<HEAD>Richard Vivers <HI>his Testimony Concerning</HI> Thomas Ellwood.</HEAD>
<P>HE was a Man of great Wisdom and Understand∣ing; and the Lord, the Giver of it, being pleased to visit him in his early Days, made choice of him▪ and by the Sanctification of his Holy Spirit, fitted, and pre∣pared him for his <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Service,</HI> whereunto he was called. And although he did not often appear as a <HI>Mi∣nister;</HI> Yet, in those Meetings set a-part for the Affairs of <HI>Truth;</HI> he often appeared in great <HI>Wisdom,</HI> hav∣ing an extraordinary Talent given of the Lord for that <HI>Work,</HI> more than many other Brethren: And faithful he was in waiting for Instruction from God, to improve the same to <HI>his Glory,</HI> and the <HI>Churches Advantage;</HI> for nothing was more desirable to him, than to be imployed in the <HI>Lord's Service:</HI> So it pleas∣ed the <HI>Almighty</HI> to furnish him with <HI>Understanding</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> faithfully to do his Days work. And now he hath taken him to himself, where his Soul is at Rest; and although our Loss be his Gain, therein I with many more are greatly comforted, for I can truly say, I loved him, in the Truth, from the First of my ac∣quaintance with him, and so it remained to the End of his Course, being near Fourty Years, since we knew each other: And when ever we conversed together, our Discourse was chiefly, concerning <HI>Heavenly Things,</HI> and the Affairs of the <HI>Church,</HI> and I always thought my Time well spent with him; although opportunity would not serve for so much of it as I desired, had it been the Will of God.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="24"/>
And this I can say, according to my Observation, He was a Man <HI>True</HI> to his <HI>Friend,</HI> and deliberate in the Choice of his <HI>Acquaintance,</HI> to whom he shewed real Love, and sincerity of Heart. And he was one of a steady and sound <HI>Judgment,</HI> as to the things of God; often desiring, that those who came amongst us, especially Children of Believing Parents, might not set∣tle down only in a <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Godliness,</HI> without the <HI>Power</HI> (at which Door, the <HI>Apostacy</HI> entred) but that they might be raised up to walk in that, wherein the <HI>Saints</HI> Fellowship doth stand, which is the <HI>Light of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> enlightening <HI>every Man that cometh into the World:</HI> And then the Ancient <HI>Te∣stimony of Truth</HI> will be more and more raised up in their Hearts, and they being Preserved of the Lord in it, it will more be maintained in its several Branches, as in former Days. Blessed be the Name of the <HI>Lord,</HI> who hath a People in these latter Ages of the World, to whom he hath given <HI>Power</HI> to stand for his <HI>Truth, whilst on Earth,</HI> and to be <HI>Tender</HI> of the <HI>Honour of his Name;</HI> of the Number of whom, this our <HI>Deceas∣ed Friend</HI> and <HI>Brother</HI> was; who, although <HI>Dead,</HI> yet his Memory <HI>Liveth,</HI> and will be preserved amongst the <HI>Righteous,</HI> in <HI>Generations yet to come.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF <HI REND="blackletterType">Thomas Ellwood.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH my Station, not be∣ing so Eminent either in the Church of Christ, or in the World, as others who have moved in higher Orbs, may not afford such considerable Remarks as theirs; yet, inasmuch as in the Course of my Travels through this Vale of Tears, I have passed through various, and some uncommon Exercises, which the Lord hath been graciously pleased to support me under, and conduct me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrough; I hold it a matter excusable, at least, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f not commendable, to give the World some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle Account of my Life, that in, Recounting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he many Deliverances and Preservations, which the Lord hath vouchsafed to work for

<P><MILESTONE N="1639" UNIT="date"/> To begin therefore with mine own Begin¦ning. I was Born in the Year of our Lord 1639, about the Beginning of the <HI>Eighth Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (so far as I have been able to inform my self<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the Parish <HI>Register,</HI> which relates to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time (not of Birth, but) of <HI>Baptism,</HI> (as the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> call it) is not to be relied on.</P>
<P>The Place of my Birth was a little Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Town, called <HI>Crowell,</HI> situate in the upper sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> Three Miles East-ward fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Thame</HI> the nearest Market-Town.</P>
<P>My Father's Name was <HI>Walter Ellwood;</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Mothers Maiden-Name was <HI>Elizabeth P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦man:</HI> both well descended; but of declinin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Families. So that what my Father Possesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (which was a pretty Estate in Lands, and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as I have heard in Monies) he received (as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had done his Name <HI>Walter</HI>) from his Grandf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ther <HI>Walter Gray;</HI> whose Daughter, and onl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Child, was his Mother.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1641" UNIT="date"/> In my very Infancy, when I was but abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Years Old, I was carried to <HI>London.</HI> F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Civil War,</HI> between <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Parliamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> breaking then forth; my Father (who favou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ed

the Parliament-Side, though he took not Arms) not holding himself safe at his Country Habitation (which lay too near some Garisons of the King's) betook himself to <HI>London,</HI> that City then holding for the Parliament.</P>
<P>There was I bred up (though not without much Difficulty, the City Air not agreeing with my tender Constitution) and there con∣tinued, until <HI>Oxford</HI> was surrendred, and the War, in Appearance, ended.</P>
<P>In this time, my Parents contracted an Ac∣quaintance, and intimate Friendship with the Lady <HI>Springett;</HI> who being then the Widow of Sir <HI>William Springett</HI> (who died in the Par∣liament Service) was afterwards the Wife of <HI>Isaac Penington,</HI> Eldest Son of Alderman <HI>Pe∣nington</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> And this Friendship de∣volving from the Parents to the Children, I be∣came an early and Particular Play-fellow to her Daughter <HI>Gulielma;</HI> being admitted, as such, to ride with her in her little Coach, drawn by her Footman about <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</HI></P>
<P>I mention this in this Place, because the Con∣tinuation of that Acquaintance and Friendship having been an Occasional Means of my being afterwards brought to the Knowledge of the Blessed TRUTH, I shall have frequent Cause, in the Course of the following Discourse, to make honourable Mention of that Family, to which I am under so many and great Obli∣gations.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1646" UNIT="date"/> Soon after the Surrender of <HI>Oxford,</HI> my Fa∣ther returned to his Estate at <HI>Crowell;</HI> which
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
by that time he might have need enough to look after, having spent (I suppose) the great¦est Part of the Monies which had been left him by his Grandfather, in maintaining himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and his Family at an high Rate in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>My elder Brother (for I had one Brothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and two Sisters, all elder than my self) was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> while we lived in <HI>London,</HI> Boarded at a privat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> School, in the House of one <HI>Francis Atkinson,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Place called <HI>Hadley,</HI> near <HI>Barnet</HI> in <HI>Hertford¦shire;</HI> where he had made some good Profici¦ency in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Tongues. But af¦ter we had left the City, and were resettled i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Country; he was taken from that privat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> School, and sent to the Free School at <HI>Tham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire.</HI></P>
<P>Thither also was I sent, as soon as my ten¦der Age would permit: for I was indeed bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> young when I went, and yet seemed younge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than I was, by reason of my low and little Sta¦ture. For it was held, for some Years, a doubt¦ful Point, whether I should not have proved a Dwarf. But after I was arrived to the Fif¦teenth Year of my Age (or thereabouts) I be¦gan to shoot up, and gave not over growing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> till I had attained the middle Size and Statu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Men.</P>
<P>At this School (which at that time was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good Reputation) I profited apace; havin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then a natural Propensity to Learning: so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the first reading over of my Lesson, I com¦monly made my self Master of it: And y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (which is strange to think of) few Boys in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chool wore out more Birch than I. For tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was never (that I remember) whip't upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Score of not having my Lesson ready, or of not saying it well: yet being a little busie Boy, full os Spirit, of a working Head, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctive Hand, I could not easily conform my self to the grave and sober Rules, and (as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen thought) severe Orders of the School; but was often playing one waggish Prank or other among my Fellow-Scholars, which subjected me to Correction, so that I have come under the Discipline of the Rod twice in a Forenoon. Which yet brake no Bones.</P>
<P>Had I been continued at this School, and in due time preferred to an higher; I might in likelihood have been a Scholar: for I was ob∣served to have a Genius apt to learn. But my Father having, so soon as the <HI>Republican-Go∣vernment</HI> began to settle, accepted the Office of a Justice of the Peace (which was no way Be∣neficial, but meerly Honorary, and every way Expensive) and put himself into a Port, and Course of Living agreeable thereunto; and having also removed my Brother from <HI>Thame</HI>-School to <HI>Merton</HI>-Colledge in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and entred him there in the highest and most chargeable Condition, of a <HI>Fellow-Commoner:</HI> he found it needful to retrench his Expences elsewhere; the Hurt of which fell upon me. For he thereup∣on took me from School, to save the Charge of Maintaining me there: which was somewhat like plucking green Fruit from the Tree, and laying it by, before it was come to its due Ripe∣ness;
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>
which will thenceforth shrink and wi¦ther, and lose that little Juice and Relish which it began to have.</P>
<P>Even so it fared with me. For being taken home when I was but young, and before I was well settled in my Studies, (though I had made a good Progress in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, and was entred in the <HI>Greek</HI>) being left too much to my self, to ply, or play with my Books, or without them, as I pleased: I soon shook Hands with my Books by shaking my Books out of my Hands, and laying them, by degrees, quite a∣side; and addicted my self to such youthfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sports and Pleasures as the Place afforded, and my Condition could reach unto.</P>
<P>By this Means, in a little time, I began to lose that little Learning I had acquired at School; and by a continued disuse of my Books, became at length so utterly a Stranger to Learn∣ing, that I could not have read, far less have understood a Sentence in <HI>Latin.</HI> Which I was so sensible of, that I warily avoided reading to others, even in an <HI>English</HI> Book, lest, if I should meet with a <HI>Latin</HI> Word, I should shame my self, by mispronouncing it.</P>
<P>Thus I went on, taking my Swing in such vain Courses, as were accounted harmless Recre∣ations; entertaining my Companions, and fami∣liar Acquaintance, with pleasant Discourses in our Conversations, by the meer Force of Mo∣ther-Wit and Natural Parts, without the Help of School-Cultivation: and was accounted good Company too.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="37"/>
But I always sorted my self with Persons of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngenuity, Temperance and Sobriety: for I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athed Scurrilities in Conversation, and had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atural Aversion to Immoderate Drinking. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at in the Time of my greatest Vanity, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reserved from Prophanness, and the grosser E∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ils of the World: which render'd me accept∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to Persons of the best Note in that Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry then. I often waited on the Lord <HI>Wenman,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his House <HI>Thame</HI>-Park (about two Miles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom <HI>Crowell,</HI> where I lived;) to whose Favour held my self intituled in a two-fold Respect: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth as my Mother was nearly related to his Lady; and as he had been pleased to bestow his Name upon me, when he made large Promises <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or me at the Font. He was a Person of great Honour and Virtue, and always gave me a kind Reception at his Table, how often soever I came. And I have cause to think, I should have received from this Lord some advantage∣ous Preferment in this World, as soon as he had found me capable of it (though betwixt him and my Father there was not then so good an Understanding as might have been wish'd) had I not been, in a little time after, called into the Service of the best and highest Lord: and there∣by lost the Favour of all my Friends, Relations and Acquaintance of this World. To the Ac∣count of which most happy Exchange I hasten, and therefore willingly pass over many Parti∣cularities of my youthful Life. Yet one Pas∣sage I am willing to mention, for the Effect it had upon me afterwards: which was thus:</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="38"/>
<MILESTONE N="1657" UNIT="date"/> My Father being then in the Commission <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Peace, and going to a <HI>Petty-Sessions</HI> at <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦lington,</HI> I waited on him thither. And whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we came near the Town, the Coachman see¦ing a nearer and easier Way, than the commo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Road, through a Corn Field, and that it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wide enough for the Wheels to run, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> endammaging the Corn, turned down there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Which being observed by an Husband-ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who was at Plow not far off, he ran to us; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stopping the Coach, poured forth a Mouthfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Complaints, in none of the best Language<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for driving over the Corn. My Father mild¦ly answered him, That if there was an Offenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> committed, he must rather impute it to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Servant, than himself; since he neither direct¦ed him to drive that Way, nor knew whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way he drove. Yet added, that he was going to such an Inn at the Town; whither if h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came, he would make him full Satisfaction, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whatsoever Dammage he had sustained there∣by. And so on we went, the Man venting his Discontent, as he went back, in angry Ac∣cents. At the Town, upon enquiry, we un∣derstood that it was a way often used, and without Dammage, being broad enough; but that it was not the common Road, which yet lay not far from it, and was also good enough: Wherefore my Father bid his Man drive Home that way.</P>
<P>It was late in the Evening when we return∣ed, and very dark; and this quarrelsome Man, who had troubled himself and us in the Morn∣ing,
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>
<MILESTONE N="1657" UNIT="date"/> having gotten another lusty Fellow, like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mself, to assist him, way-lay'd us in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, expecting we would return the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay we came. But when they found we did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, but took the common Way, they, angry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at they were disappointed, and loth to lose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir Purpose, (which was to put an Abuse up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us) coasted over to us in the dark, and lay∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g hold on the Horses Bridles, stopt them from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oing on. My Father asking his Man, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Reason was that he went not on, was an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wered, <HI>That there were two Men at the Horses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eads, who held them back, and would not suffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em to go forward.</HI> Whereupon my Father, o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ening the Boot, step't out, and I followed close <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Heels. Going up to the place where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Men stood, he demanded of them the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason of this Assault. They said, <HI>We were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the Corn.</HI> We knew, by the Routs, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere not on the Corn, but in the common way, nd told them so. But they told us, <HI>They were esolved they would not let us go on any farther, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould make us go back again.</HI> My Father endea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oured, by gentle Reasoning, to perswade them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forbear, and not run themselves farther into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Danger of the Law, which they were run <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo far into already: but they rather derided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im for it. Seeing therefore fair Means would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot work upon them, he spake more roughly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o them, charging them to deliver their Clubs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>for each of them had a great Club in his Hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omewhat like those which are called <HI>Quarter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taves.</HI>) They thereupon, laughing, told him,

<P>As my Father was not able to maintain th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Argument on his Side: so neither did the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seem willing to drive it on to an Extremity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their side.

<P>The next Morning we prepared to retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Home (that is, my Father, my younger Siste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and my self: for my elder Sister was gone be¦fore, by the Stage Coach, to <HI>London.</HI>) An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when, having taken our Leaves of our Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we went forth; they, with <HI>Edward Burroug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> accompanying us to the Gate: he there direct¦ed his Speech, in a few Words to each of u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> severally; according to the Sense he had o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our several Conditions. And when we were gone off, and they gone in again; they asking him what he thought of us: he answered them, (as they afterwards told me) to this Effect, <HI>As for the Old Man, he is settled on his Lees; and the Young Woman is light and airy: but the Young Man is Reach't, and may do well, if he don't lose it.</HI> And surely that which he said to me, or
<PB N="51" REF="51"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> rather that Spirit in which he spake it, took such fast hold on me; that I felt Sadness and Trouble come over me, though I did not di∣stinctly understand what I was troubled for. I knew not what I ayled, but I knew I ayled something more than ordinary: and my Heart was very heavy.</P>
<P>I found it was not so with my Father and Sister: for as I rode after the Coach, I could hear them talk pleasantly one to the other, but they could not discern how it was with me, because I, riding on Horsback, kept much out of Sight.</P>
<P>By that time we got home it was Night. And the next Day, being the first Day of the Week, I went in the Afternoon to hear the Mi∣nister of <HI>Chinner;</HI> and this was the last time I ever went to hear any of that Function. After the Sermon, I went with him to his House, and in a Freedom of Discourse (which, from a cer∣tain Intimacy that was between us, I common∣ly used with him) told him where I had been, what Company I had met with there, and what Observations I had made to my self thereupon. He seemed to understand as little of them, as I had done before: and civilly ab∣stained from casting any unhandsome Reflec∣tions on them.</P>
<P>I had a Desire to go to another Meeting of the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and bid my Father's Man enquire, if there was any in the Country thereabouts. He thereupon told me, he had heard at <HI>Isaac</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="52"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> <HI>Penington</HI>'s, that there was to be a Meeting at <HI>High-Wiccomb</HI> on <HI>Thursday</HI> next.</P>
<P>Thither therefore I went, though it was Seven Miles from me. And that I might be rather thought to go out a Coursing, than to a Meeting; I let my Gray-Hound run by my Horse-side.</P>
<P>When I came there, and had set up my Horse at an Inn; I was at a Loss how to find the House where the Meeting was to be. I knew it not: and was ashamed to ask after it. Wherefore having order'd the Horstler to take Care of my Dog, I went into the Street, and stood at the Inn-Gate; musing with my self what Course to take. But I had not stood long, e're I saw an Horse-man riding along the Street; whom I remember'd I had seen before at <HI>Isaac Penington</HI>'s: and he put up his Horse at the same Inn. Him therefore I resolved to follow, supposing he was going to the Meet∣ing, as indeed he was.</P>
<P>Being come to the House (which proved to be <HI>John Raunce</HI>'s) I saw the People sitting to∣gether, in an outer Room: wherefore I stept in, and sate down on the first void Seat, the End of a Bench just within the Door; having my Sword by my Side, and Black Cloaths on, which drew some Eyes upon me. It was not long e're one stood up and spake, whom I was afterwards well acquainted with (his Name was <HI>Samuel Thornton;</HI>) and what he spake was very suitable, and of good Service to me: for
<PB N="53" REF="53"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> it reached Home, as if it had been directed to me.</P>
<P>As soon as ever the Meeting was ended, and the People began to rise, I, being next the Door, step't out quickly; and hastning to my Inn, took Horse immediately homewards: and (so far as I remember) my having been gone was not taken Notice of by my Father.</P>
<P>This latter Meeting was like the Clinching of a Nail; confirming, and fastening in my Mind, those good Principles, which had sunk into me at the former. My Understanding be∣gan to open, and I felt some Stirrings in my Breast, tending to the Work of a New Crea∣tion in me. The general Trouble, and Confu∣sion of Mind, which had for some Days lain heavy upon me, and pressed me down, with∣out a distinct Discovery of the particular Cause for which it came, began now to wear off; and some Glimmerings of Light began to break forth in me; which let me see my Inward State, and Condition towards God. The Light (which before had shone in my Darkness, and the Darkness could not comprehend it) began now to shine out of Darkness, and in some Measure discovered to me what it was, that had before clouded me, and brought that Sad∣ness and Trouble upon me. And now I saw, that although I had been, in a great degree, preserved from the common Immoralities, and gross Pollutions of the World; yet the Spirit of the World had hitherto ruled in me, and led me into Pride, Flattery, Vanity and Super∣fluity;
<PB N="54" REF="54"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> all which was Naught. I found there were many Plants growing in me, which were not of the <HI>Heavenly Father's Planting:</HI> and that all these (of whatever sort or kind they were, or how specious soever they might appear) must be plucked up.</P>
<P>Now was all my former Life ripped up, and my Sins, by Degrees, were set in order before me. And though they looked not with so black a Hue, and so deep a Dye, as those of the lewdest Sort of People did: Yet I found that all Sin (even that which had the fairest or finest shew, as well as that which was more course and foul) brought Guilt, and <HI>with</HI> and <HI>for Guilt,</HI> Condemnation on the Soul that sin∣ned. This I felt: and was greatly bowed down under the Sense thereof.</P>
<P>Now also did I receive a New Law, (an <HI>In∣ward Law</HI> superadded to the <HI>Outward</HI>) <HI>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus,</HI> which wrought in me against all Evil, not only <HI>in Deed,</HI> and <HI>in Word,</HI> but even <HI>in Thought</HI> also: so that every thing was brought to Judgment, and Judgment passed upon all. So that I could not any longer go on, in my former Ways, and Course of Life: for when I did, Judgment took hold upon me for it.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord was graciously pleased to deal with me, in somewhat like manner as he had dealt with his People <HI>Israel</HI> of Old (when they had transgressed his Righteous LAW) whom, by his Prophet, he called back, re∣quired <HI>to put away the Evil of their Doings:</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="55"/>

<P>I was now required, by this <HI>Inward</HI> and <HI>Spiritual LAW (The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus)</HI> to <HI>put away the Evil of my Do∣ings;</HI> and <HI>to Cease to do Evil.</HI> And what, in Particulars, the <HI>Evil</HI> was, which I was requi∣red to <HI>to put away,</HI> and <HI>to cease from:</HI> that Mea∣sure of the <HI>Divine</HI> LIGHT, which was now manifested in me, discovered to me: and what the Light made manifest to be <HI>Evil,</HI> Judgment passed upon.</P>
<P>So that here began to be a Way cast up, be∣fore me, for me to walk in: A direct and plain Way; so plain, <HI>that a way-faring-Man,</HI> how weak and simple soever (<HI>though a Fool,</HI> to the Wisdom, and in the Judgment of the World) <HI>could not Err,</HI> while he continued to walk in it: the Error <HI>coming in</HI> by his <HI>going out of it.</HI> And this Way, with respect to me, I saw was that Measure of <HI>Divine Light,</HI> which was manifest∣ed in me; by which the <HI>Evil of my Doings,</HI> which I was to put away, and to cease from, was dis∣covered to me.</P>
<P>By this <HI>Divine Light</HI> then I saw, that though I had not the Evil of the <HI>common Uncleanness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bauchery, Prophanness,</HI> and <HI>Pollutions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rld</HI> to <HI>put away,</HI> because I had, through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at <HI>Goodness of GOD,</HI> and a <HI>Civil Educa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> been preserved out of those <HI>grosser Evils:</HI>

<P>When I had set up my Horse, I went directly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Hall, where the Sessions were held; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here I had been but a very little while, before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Knot of my old Acquaintances espying me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to me. One of these was a Scholar in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own; another a Surgeon of that City (both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y School-Fellows, and Fellow-Boarders at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame-School:</HI>) and the Third a Country Gentle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an, with whom I had long been very Familiar.</P>
<P>When they were come up to me, they all sa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted me, after the usual manner, putting off
<PB N="64" REF="64"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> their Hats and Bowing; and saying, <HI>Your Hum∣ble Servant, Sir:</HI> expecting, no doubt, the like from me. But when they saw me stand still, not moving my Cap, nor bowing my Knee in way of <HI>Congee</HI> to them; they were amazed, and looked first one upon another, then upon me, and then one upon another again, for a while, without a Word speaking.</P>
<P>At length the Surgeon, (a brisk young Man) who stood nearest to me, clapping his Hand, in a familiar way, upon my Shoulder, and smiling on me, said, <HI>What!</HI> TOM, <HI>a Quaker!</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which I readily, and cheerfully Answered, <HI>Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> A Quaker.</HI> And as the Words passed out of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mouth, I felt Joy spring in my Heart: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rejoyced, that I had not been drawn out b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, into a Compliance with them; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I had Strength and Boldness given me, to Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦fess my self to be one of that despised People.</P>
<P>They staid not long with me, nor said an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more (that I remember) to me: but lookin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> somewhat confusedly one upon another, after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> while took their Leave of me; going off in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same ceremonious Manner, as they came on.</P>
<P>After they were gone, I walked a while a¦bout the Hall, and went up nearer to the Court to observe both what Justices were on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bench, and what Business they had before them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And I went in Fear (not of what they coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or would have done to me, if they should ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken notice of me, but) lest I should be su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦prized, and drawn unwarily into that, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I was to keep out of.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="65"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> It was not long before the Court adjourned, to go to Dinner: And that time I took to go to the <HI>Clerk of the Peace,</HI> at his House, whom I was well acquainted with. So soon as I came into the Room where he was, he came and met me; and saluted me after his manner: for he had a great Respect for my Father, and a kind Regard for me. And tho' he was at first some∣what startled at my Carriage and Language: yet he treated me very civilly, without any Reflection, or shew of Lightness. I delivered him the <HI>Recognizances,</HI> which my Father had sent; and having done the Business I came up∣on, withdrew: and went to my Inn, to refresh my self, and then to return home.</P>
<P>But when I was ready to take Horse, looking out into the Street, I saw two or three Justices, standing just in the Way where I was to ride. This brought a fresh Concern upon me. I knew, if they saw me, they would know me: And I concluded, if they knew me, they would stop me to enquire after my Father; and I doubted how I should come off with them.</P>
<P>This Doubting brought Weakness on me; and that Weakness led to Contrivance, how I might avoid this Trial. I knew the City pret∣y well; and remembred there was a back Way, which, though somewhat about, would bring me out of Town, without passing by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose Justices: Yet loth I was to go that Way. Wherefore I staid a pretty time, in hopes they would have parted Company, or removed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome other Place, out of my Way. But when
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> I had waited till I was uneasie, for losing so much time; having entred into Reasonings with Flesh and Blood, the Weakness prevailed over me, and away I went the back Way: which brought Trouble and Grief upon my Spi∣rit, for having shunned the Cross.</P>
<P>But the Lord looked on me with a tender Eye; and seeing my Heart was right to him, and that what I had done was meerly through Weakness, and Fear of Falling, and that I was sensible of my Failing therein, and sorry for it: he was graciously pleased to pass it by, and speak Peace to me again. So that, before I got home, as when I went in the Morning, my Heart was full of Breathing Prayer to the Lord, that he would vouchsafe to be with me, and up∣hold and carry me through that Days Exercise: So now at my Return in the Evening, my Heart was full of thankful Acknowledgments, and Praises unto Him, for his great Goodness and Favour to me, in having thus far preserved, and kept me from falling into any thing that might have brought Dishonour to his Holy Name, which I had now taken on me.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding that it was thus with me, and that I found Peace and Acceptance with the Lord in some good degree, according to my Obedience to the Convictions I had re∣ceived, by his <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> in me: yet was not the Vail so done away, or fully rent, but that there still remained a Cloud upon my Under∣standing, with respect to my Carriage towards my Father. And that Notion, which the Ene∣my
<PB N="67" REF="67"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> had brought into my Mind, That <HI>I ought to put such a Difference between him all others, as that, on the Account of Paternal Relation, I should still deport my self towards him, both in Gesture and Language, as I had always heretofore done;</HI> did yet prevail with me. So that when I came home, I went to my Father bare headed, as I used to do; and gave him a particular Account of the Business he had given me in Command, in such manner, that he, observing no altera∣tion in my Carriage towards him, found no Cause to take Offence at me.</P>
<P>I had felt for sometime before, an earnest Desire of Mind to go again to <HI>Isaac Penington</HI>'s. And I began to question whether, when my Father should come (as I concluded e're long he would) to understand I enclined to settle a∣mong the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> he would per∣mit me the Command of his Horses, as before. Wherefore, in the Morning when I went to <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> I gave Direction to a Servant of his, to go that Day to a Gentleman of my Acquaintance (who I knew had a Riding Nag to put off, either by Sale, or to be kept for his Work;) and desire him, in my Name, to send him to me; which he did, and I found him in the Stable, when I came home.</P>
<P>On this Nag I designed to ride next Day to <HI>Isaac Penington</HI>'s: and in order thereunto, arose betimes and got my self ready for the Journey. But because I would pay all due Respects to my Father, and not go without his Consent, or Knowledge at the least, I sent one up to him
<PB N="68" REF="68"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> (for he was not yet stirring) to acquaint him, that I had a Purpose to go to <HI>Isaac Peuington</HI>'s; and desired to know if he pleased to Command me any Service to them. He sent me Word, He <HI>would speak with me before I went; and would have me come up to him:</HI> which I did; and stood by his Bed-Side.</P>
<P>Then in a mild and gentle Tone, he said, <HI>I understand you have a Mind to go to Mr.</HI> Pening∣ton<HI>'s.</HI> I answered, I have so. <HI>Why,</HI> said he, <HI>I wonder why you should. You were there, you know, but a few Days ago; and unless you had Business with them, don't you think it will look odly?</HI> I said, I I thought not. <HI>I doubt,</HI> said he, <HI>You'll tire them with your Company, and make them think they shall be troubled with you.</HI> If, replyed I, I find any thing of that, I'll make the shorter Stay. <HI>But,</HI> said he, <HI>can you propose any sort of Business with them, more than a meer Visit?</HI> Yes, said I, I pro∣pose to my self not only to see them; but to have some Discourse with them. <HI>Why,</HI> said he (in a Tone a little Harsher) <HI>I hope you don't en∣cline to be of their Way.</HI> Truly, answered I, I like them, and their Way, very well; so far as I yet understand it: and I am willing to Go to them, that I may understand it better.</P>
<P>Thereupon he began to reckon up a Bead-Roll of Faults against the <HI>Quakers;</HI> Telling me <HI>They were a rude unmannerly People, that would not give Civil Respect or Honour to their Superiors; no not to Magistrates: That they held many dan∣gerous Principles: That they were an immodest, shameless People; and that one of them strip't him∣self</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> <HI>stark-naked, and went in that unseemly manner about the Streets, at Fairs, and on Market-days in great Towns.</HI></P>
<P>To all the other Charges, I answered only, That perhaps they might be either misreport∣ed, or misunderstood, as the best of People had sometimes been. But to the last Charge, of <HI>Going Naked,</HI> a particular Answer, by way of Instance, was just then brought into my Mind, and put into my Mouth, which I had not thought of before: and that was the Example of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> who went <HI>Naked,</HI> among the People, for a long time, (<HI>Isai.</HI> 20. 4.) <HI>Aye,</HI> said my Fa∣ther, <HI>but you must consider, that He was a Prophet of the Lord, and had an express Command from God to Go so.</HI> Yes, Sir, replied I, I do consi∣der that: but I consider also, that the <HI>Jews</HI> a∣mong whom he lived, did not own him for a Prophet, nor believe that he had such a Com∣mand from God. And, added I, how know we but that this <HI>Quaker</HI> may be a Prophet too, and might be commanded to do as he did, for some Reason which we understand not.</P>
<P>This put my Father to a stand; so that let∣ting fall his Charges against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> he only said, <HI>I would wish you not to go so soon; but take a little time to consider of it: you may Visit Mr.</HI> Penington <HI>hereafter.</HI> Nay, Sir, replied I, Pray don't hinder my going now: for I have so strong a Desire to go, that I do not well know how to forbear. And as I spake those Words, I withdrew gently to the Chamber-Door; and then hastning down Stairs, went immediately
<PB N="70" REF="70"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> to the Stable: where finding my Horse ready Bridled, I forthwith mounted, and went off; lest I should receive a Countermand.</P>
<P>This Discourse with my Father had cast me somewhat back in my Journey, and it being Fifteen long Miles thither, the Ways bad, and my Nag but small: it was in the Afternoon that I got thither. And understanding by the Servant that took my Horse, that there was then a Meeting in the House (as there was Weekly on that Day, which was the <HI>Fourth Day</HI> of the Week, though I, till then, under∣stood it not) I hastened in; and knowing the Rooms, went directly to the <HI>Little Parlour,</HI> where I found a few Friends sitting together in Silence: and I sate down among them, well satisfied, though without Words.</P>
<P>When the Meeting was ended, and those of the Company, who were Strangers, withdrawn, I addressed my self to <HI>Isaac Penington</HI> and his Wife, who received me courteously: but not knowing what Exercise I had been in, and yet was under, nor having heard any thing of me, since I had been there before, in another Garb, were not forward at first to lay suddain Hands on me; which I observed, and did not dislike. But as they came to see a Change in me, not in Habit only, but in Gesture, Speech and Carri∣age, and which was more, in Countenance al∣so: (for the Exercise I had passed through, and yet was under, had imprinted a visible Cha∣racter of Gravity upon my Face;) they were exceeding kind, and tender towards me.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="71"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> There was then in the Family a Friend, whose Name was <HI>Anne Curtis</HI> (the Wife of <HI>Thomas Curtis</HI> of <HI>Reading</HI>) who was come upon a Visit to them, and particularly to see <HI>Mary Penington</HI>'s Daughter <HI>Guli:</HI> who had been ill of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> since I had been there before.

<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> We spent much of the Evening in Retired∣ness of Mind, our Spirits being weightily ga∣thered inward: so that not much Discourse pas¦sed among us; neither they to me, nor I to them, offered any Occasion. Yet I had good Satisfaction in that Stilness; feeling my Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drawn near to the Lord, and to them therein.</P>
<P>Before I went to Bed, they let me know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that there was to be a Meeting at <HI>Wiccomb</HI> nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Day; and that some of the Family would g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to it. I was very glad of it: for I greatly d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sired to go to Meetings; and this fell very ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ly, it being in my way home. Next Mornin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Isaac Penington</HI> himself went, having <HI>Anne Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tis</HI> with him: and I accompanied them.</P>
<P>At <HI>Wiccomb</HI> we met with <HI>Edward Burroug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> who came from <HI>Oxford</HI> thither, that Day that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> going thither, met him on the Way: and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ving both our <HI>Mountier-Caps</HI> on, we recollecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that we had met, and passed by each other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Road unknown.</P>
<P>This was a Monthly Meeting, consisting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Friends</HI> chiefly, who gathered to it from sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parts of the Country thereabouts: so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was pretty large, and was held in a fair Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>Jeremiah Steevens</HI>'s House; the Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where I had been at a Meeting before, in <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Raunce</HI>'s House, being too little to receive us.</P>
<P>A very good Meeting was this, in its se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and to me. <HI>Edward Burrough</HI>'s Ministry ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forth among us in Life and Power; and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Assembly was covered therewith. I also, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦cording to my small Capacity, had a Sha

<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> therein. For I felt some of that Divine Power, working my Spirit into a great Tenderness; and not only Confirming me in the Course I had already entred, and strengthning me to go on therein: but rending also the Vail somewhat further, and Clearing my Understanding in some other things, which I had not seen before. For the Lord was pleased to make his Disco∣veries to me by degrees; that the Sight of too great a Work, and too many Enemies to en∣counter with at once, might not discourage me, and make me faint.</P>
<P>When the Meeting was ended, the <HI>Friends</HI> of the Town, taking notice, that I was the Man that had been at their Meeting the Week before, whom they then did not know; some of them came, and spake lovingly to me, and would have had me staid with them: but <HI>Ed∣ward Burrough</HI> going home with <HI>Isaac Penington.</HI> he invited me to go back with him; which I willingly consented to. For the Love I had more particularly to <HI>Edward Burrough,</HI> through whose Ministry I had received the first awak∣ning Stroke, drew me to desire his Company; and so away we rode together.</P>
<P>But I was somewhat disappointed of my Ex∣pectation: for I hoped he would have given me both Opportunity and Encouragement, to have opened my self to him, and to have poured forth my Complaints, Fears, Doubts and Ques∣tionings into his Bosom. But he, being sensible that I was truly reach'd; and that the <HI>Witness</HI> of GOD was raised, and the <HI>Work</HI> of GOD
<PB N="74" REF="74"/>
<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> rightly begun in me: chose to leave me to the <HI>Guidance of the good Spirit in my self</HI> (the <HI>Coun∣sellor</HI> that could resolve all Doubts) that I might not have any Dependence on Man. Where∣fore, although he was naturally of an open, and free Temper and Carriage; and was after∣wards always very familiar, and affectionately kind to me: yet at this time he kept himself somewhat reserved, and shewed only common Kindness to me.</P>
<P>Next Day we parted. He, for <HI>London:</HI> I home; under a very great Weight and Exer∣cise upon my Spirit. For I now saw, <HI>in</HI> and <HI>by</HI> the farther <HI>Openings</HI> of the DIVINE LIGHT in me, that the Enemy, by his <HI>false Reasonings,</HI> had <HI>beguiled</HI> and <HI>misled</HI> me, with respect to my <HI>Carriage towards my Father.</HI> For I now clearly saw, That the <HI>Honour</HI> due to <HI>Parents,</HI> did not consist in <HI>Uncovering the Head,</HI> and <HI>Bow∣ing the Body</HI> to them; but in a <HI>ready Obedience to their Lawful Commands,</HI> and in <HI>Performing all needful Services unto them.</HI> Wherefore, as I was greatly troubled for what I already had done, in that Case, though it was through Ig∣norance: So I plainly felt I could no longer continue therein, without drawing on my self the Guilt of <HI>wilful Disobedience;</HI> which I well knew would draw after it <HI>Divine Displeasure</HI> and <HI>Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon the Enemy assaulted me afresh; setting before me the <HI>Danger</HI> I should run my self into, of provoking my Father to use Seve∣rity towards me: and perhaps to the casting

<P>Thus labouring under various Exercises on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Way, I at length got home; expecting I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould have but a rough Reception from my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather. But when I came home, I understood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Father was from home. Wherefore I sate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own, by the Fire, in the Kitchin; keeping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Mind retired to the Lord, with Breathings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spirit to Him, that I might be preserved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om falling.</P>
<P>After some time I heard the Coach drive in, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich put me into a little Fear, and a sort of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivering came over me.

<P>His Man, seeing this, and not able to con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain himself, step't in between us; and laying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old on the Cane, by Strength of Hand held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t so fast, that though he attempted not to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t away, yet he with-held my Father from striking with it: which did but enrage him the more.

<P>But now my Sister, fearing lest my Fathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should fall upon me again; besought him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forbear: adding, <HI>Indeed, Sir, if you strike hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any more, I will throw open the Casement, and C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Murther; for I am afraid you will kill my Brothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> This stop't his Hand; and after some Threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ning Speeches, he commanded me to <HI>Get to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chamber:</HI> which I did; as I always did whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever he bid me.</P>
<P>Thither, soon after, my Sister followed m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to see my Arm, and dress it: for it was, indee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very much bruised and swelled, between th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wrist and the Elbow; and in some places th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Skin was broken, and beaten off.

<P>This was (so far as I remember) the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time, that ever my Father called his Family t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Prayer.</HI> And this was also the last time, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he ever fell, so severely at least, upon me.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"/> People; her affectionate Regard to me, made her rather Pity, than Despise me: and the more, when she understood what hard Usage I had met with.</P>
<P>The rest of this Winter I spent in a lonesome solitary Life; having none to Converse with, none to unbosom my self unto, none to ask Counsel of, none to seek Relief from, but the LORD alone; who yet was more than All. And yet the Company and Society of Faithful and Judicious <HI>Friends,</HI> would (I thought) have been very welcome, as well as helpful to me in my Spiritual Travel: in which I thought I made but a slow Progress; my Soul breathing after further Attainments; The Sence of which drew from me the following Lines:</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> At length it pleased the Lord to move <HI>Isaac Penington</HI> and his Wife to make a Visit to my Father, and see how it fared with me: And very welcome they were to me; whatever they were to him: to whom I doubt not but they would have been more welcome, had it not been for me.</P>
<P>They tarried with us all Night; and much Discourse they had with my Father, both about
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
<MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> the Principle of TRUTH in general, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in particular: which I was not privy to. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one thing, I remember, I afterwards heard of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which was this.</P>
<P>When my Father and we were at thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House, some Months before, <HI>Mary Penington<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in some Discourse between them, had told hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how hardly her Husband's Father (Alderma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Penington</HI>) had dealt with him about his Hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which my Father (little then thinking that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would, and so soon too, be his own Case) di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very much Censure the Alderman for: won¦dring that so wise a Man as he was, shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> take Notice of such a trivial Thing, as the <HI>Put¦ting off,</HI> or <HI>keeping on a Hat;</HI> and he spare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not to blame him liberally for it.</P>
<P>This gave her a Handle, to take hold of him by. And having had an ancient Acquaintance with him; and he having always had an high Opinion of, and Respect for her: she, who was a Woman of great Wisdom, of ready Speech, and of a well-resolved Spirit, did pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so close upon him, with this Home-Argument<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he was utterly to seek, and at a loss how to defend himself.</P>
<P>After Dinner next Day, when they were ready to take Coach to return home; she de¦sired my Father that, since my Company was so little acceptable to him, he would give me leave to Go, and spend some time with them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where I should be sure to be welcome.</P>
<P>He was very unwilling I should go; and made many Objections against it: all which
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
<MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> she Answered, and removed so clearly, that not finding what Excuse further to alledge; he, at length left it to me; and I soon turned the Scale for Going.</P>
<P>We were come to the Coach-side before this was concluded on, and I was ready to step in; when one of my Sisters privately put my Fa∣ther in Mind, that I had never a Hat on. That somewhat startled him: for he did not think it fit I should go from home (and that so far, and to stay abroad) without a Hat. Wherefore he whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to her, to fetch me a Hat, and he entertained them with some Dis∣course in the mean time. But as soon as he saw the Hat coming, he would not stay till it came, lest I should put it on before him; but breaking off his Discourse abruptly, took his leave of them, and hastened in, before the Hat was brought to me.</P>
<P>I had not one Penny of Money about me; nor any, indeed, elsewhere. For my Father, so soon as he saw that I would be a <HI>Quaker,</HI> took from me both what Money I had, and every thing else of Value, or that would have made Money, as some Plate Buttons, Rings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pretending that he would keep them for me, till I came to my self again, lest I, in the mean time should destroy them.</P>
<P>But as I had no Money; so, being among my Friends, I had no need of any, nor ever honed after it: though once upon a particular Occa∣sion I had like to have wanted it. The Case was thus.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94"/>
<MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> I had been at <HI>Reading,</HI> and set out from thence on the First Day of the Week, in the Morning: intending to reach (as, in point of Time, I well might) to <HI>Isaac Penington</HI>'s; where the Meeting was to be that Day: but when I came to <HI>Maidenhead</HI> (a thorough-fair Town on the Way) I was stop't by the Watch for Riding on that Day.</P>
<P>The Watchman, laying hold on the Bridle, told me, <HI>I must go with him to the Constable<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and accordingly I, making no Resistance, suf∣fered him to lead my Horse to the Constable's Door. When we were come there, the Con∣stable told me, <HI>I must go before the Warden</HI> (who was the Chief Officer of that Town) and bid the Watchman bring me on, himself walk∣ing before.</P>
<P>Being come to the Warden's Door, the Con∣stable knock't, and desired to speak with Mr. <HI>Warden.</HI> He thereupon quickly coming to the Door, the Constable said, <HI>Sir, I have brought a Man here to you, whom the Watch took riding through the Town.</HI> The Warden was a budge old Man; and I looked somewhat big too: having a good Gelding under me, and a good Riding Coat on my Back; both which my Friend <HI>Isaac Penington</HI> had kindly accommo∣dated me with for that Journey.</P>
<P>The Warden therefore taking me to be (as the Saying is) <HI>Somebody;</HI> put off his Hat, and made a low <HI>Congee</HI> to me: but when he saw that I sate still, and neither bowed to him, nor moved my Hat; he gave a start, and said
<PB N="93" REF="95"/><MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Constable, <HI>You said you had brought a Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut he don't behave himself like a Man.</HI></P>
<P>I sate still upon my Horse, and said not a Word; but kept my Mind retired to the Lord: waiting to see what this would come to.</P>
<P>The Warden then began to Examine me, Asking me <HI>Whence I came?</HI> and <HI>Whither I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oing?</HI> I told him I came from <HI>Reading,</HI> and was going to <HI>Chalfont.</HI> He asked me <HI>Why I did Travel on that Day?</HI> I told him, I did not know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat it would give any Offence barely to Ride, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Walk on that Day; so long as I did not Car∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y or Drive any Carriage, or Horses laden with Burthens. <HI>Why,</HI> said he, <HI>if your Business was ur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, did you not take a Pass from the Mayor of</HI> Reading? Because, replied I, I did not know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or think I should have needed one. <HI>Well,</HI> said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, <HI>I will not talk with you now, because it is time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Go to Church; but I will Examine you further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>non:</HI> And turning to the Constable, <HI>Have him,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid he, <HI>to an Inn, and bring him before me after Dinner.</HI></P>
<P>The Naming of an Inn put me in Mind, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch publick Houses were places of Expence; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd I knew I had no Money to defray it. Wherefore I said to the Warden, Before thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endest me to an Inn, which may occasion some Expence; I think it needful to acquaint thee, that I have no Money.</P>
<P>At that the Warden startled again; and turning quick upon me, said, <HI>How! No Money! How can that be? You don't look like a Man that has no Money.</HI> However I look, said I, I tell
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
<MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> thee the Truth, that I have no Money: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tell it to forewarn thee, that thou mayst no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bring any Charge upon the Town. <HI>I wonder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> said he, <HI>what Art you have got, that you can Tra¦vel without Money: you can do more, I assure you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than I can.</HI></P>
<P>I making no Answer, he went on, and said<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Well, well! but if you have no Money, you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good Horse under you; and we can Distrain hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the Charge.</HI> But, said I, the Horse is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mine. <HI>No!</HI> said he, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut you have a good Coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on your Back: and that, I hope, is your own:</HI> No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said I, but it is not: for I borrowed both th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Horse and the Coat.</P>
<P>With that the Warden, holding up hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hands, and smiling, said, <HI>Bless me! I neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> met with such a Man as you are before! What<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were you set out by the Parish?</HI> Then turning to the Constable, he said, <HI>Have him to the Gray¦hound, and bid the People be civil to him.</HI> Ac¦cordingly to the Grayhound I was led; my Horse set up, and I put into a large Room<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and some Account, I suppose, given of me to the People of the House.</P>
<P>This was new Work to me; and what the Issue of it would be, I could not foresee: but being left there alone, I sate down, and retired in Spirit to the Lord (in whom alone my Strength and Safety was) and beg'd support of Him; even that he would be pleased to give me Wisdom, and Words to Answer the War∣den, when I should come to be Examined a∣gain before him.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97"/>
<MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> After some time, having Pen, Ink and Paper about me, I set my self to write what I thought might be proper, if Occasion served, to give the Warden. And while I was writing, the Ma∣ster of the House being come home from his Worship, sent the Tapster to me, to invite me to dine with him. I bid him tell his Master, that I had not any Money to pay for my Dinner. He sent the Man again to tell me, <HI>I should be welcome to dine with him, though I had no Money.</HI> I desired him to tell his Master, that I was very sensible of his Civility and Kindness, in so cour∣teously inviting me to his Table; but I had not freedom to eat of his Meat, unless I could have paid for it. So he went on with his Din∣ner, and I with my Writing.</P>
<P>But before I had finished what was on my Mind to write, the Constable came again; bringing with him his Fellow-Constable. This was a brisk, genteel young Man, a Shopkeeper in the Town, whose Name was <HI>Cherry.</HI> They saluted me Civilly, and told me they were come to have me before the Warden. This put an End to my Writing; which I put into my Pocket, and went along with them.</P>
<P>Being come to the Warden's, He asked me again the same Questions he had asked me be∣fore: To which I gave him the like Answers. Then he told me the Penalty I had incurred: which, he said, was either to pay so much Mo∣ney; or lye so many Hours in the Stocks: and asked me which I would chuse. I reply'd, I shall not chuse either. And said I, I have told
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
<MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> thee already that I have no Money: though i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I had, I could not so far Acknowledge my sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an Offender, as to pay any. But as to lying i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Stocks, I am in thy Power, to do unto me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what it shall please the Lord to suffer thee.</P>
<P>When he heard that, he paused awhile; and then told me, <HI>He considered that I was but a Young Man, and might not, perhaps, understand the danger I had brought my self into: and therefore he would not use the Severity of the Law upon me; but in hopes that I would be wiser hereafter, he would pass by this Offence, and discharge me.</HI></P>
<P>Then putting on a Countenance of the great∣est Gravity, he said to me; <HI>But, young Man, I would have you know, That you have not only bro∣ken the Law of the Land! but the Law of God al∣so: and therefore you ought to ask Him Forgiveness; for you have highly offended Him.</HI> That, said I, I would most willingly do; if I were sensible that, in this Case, I had offended Him, by breaking any Law of His. <HI>Why,</HI> said he, <HI>do you question that?</HI> Yes, truly, said I: for I do not know that any Law of God doth forbid me to Ride on this Day.</P>
<P><HI>No!</HI> said he, <HI>that's strange! Where, I wonder, were you Bred? You can read: Can't you?</HI> Yes, said I, that I can. <HI>Don't you read then,</HI> said he, <HI>the Commandment;</HI> Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy. Six Days shalt thou La∣bour, and do all thy Work: but the Seventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any Work. Yes, replyed I, I have both read it often, and remember it very

<P>Here the younger Constable (whose Name was <HI>Cherry</HI>) interposing, said, <HI>Mr.</HI> Warden, <HI>the Gentleman is in the right as to that: for this is the first Day of the Week; and not the Seventh.</HI></P>
<P>This the old Warden took in <HI>dudgeon;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oking severely on the Constable, said, <HI>What! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you take upon you to teach me! I'll have you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>now, I will not be taught by you. As you please <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r that, Sir,</HI> said the Constable; <HI>but I am sure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u are mistaken in this Point: for</HI> Saturday, <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, is the</HI> Seventh Day; <HI>and you know Yesterday <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as</HI> Saturday.</P>
<P>This made the Warden hot and testy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut him almost out of all Patience: so that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar'd it would have come to a downright Quar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el betwixt them: for both were confident, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>either would yield.

<P>Away thereupon went I, with that Consta¦ble; leaving the Old Warden, and the Young Constable to compose their Difference, as they could. Being come to the Inn, the Constable called for my Horse to be brought out. Which done, I immediately Mounted, and began to set forward.

<P>A secret Joy arose in me, as I rode on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Way; for that I had been preserved from D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing, or Saying any thing, which might gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Adversaries of TRUTH Advantage again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, or the <HI>Friends</HI> of it: and Praises sprang i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my thankful Heart to the Lord, my Preserve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>

<P>For as I rode between <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Mainden∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead,</HI> I saw lying in my way the Scabbard of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anger; which, having lost its Hook, had slipt off, I suppose, and drop't from the Side of the Wearer: and it had in it a pair of Knives, whose Hafts being inlaid with Silver, seemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be of some Value. I alighted, and took it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p; and clapping it between my Thigh and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Saddle, rode on a little way: but I quickly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound it too heavy for me; and the Reprover <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me soon began to Check.

And when afterwards I was stop't, and seized on at <HI>Maidenhead;</HI> I saw there was a Providence in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot bringing it with me: which, if it should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been found (as it needs must) under my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oat, when I came to be Unhorsed, might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave raised some evil Suspicion, or sinister <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>houghts concerning me.</P>
<P>The Stop I met with at <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent me so much time, that when I came to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aac Penington</HI>'s, the Meeting there was half <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er: Which gave them Occasion, after Meet∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, to enquire of me, If any thing had befal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n me on the Way, which had caused me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come so late.

<P>While I was then in <HI>London,</HI> I went to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle Meeting of Friends, which was then held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the House of one <HI>Humphry Bache</HI> a Gold∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mith, at the Sign of the Snail in <HI>Tower-street.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was then a very troublesome Time, not from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Government, but from the Rabble of Boys <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d rude People, who upon the Turn of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes (at the Return of the KING) took Li∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erty to be very abusive.</P>
<P>When the Meeting ended, a pretty Number <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these unruly Folk were got together at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor, ready to receive the Friends as they came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, not only with evil Words, but with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows; which I saw they bestowed freely on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of them that were gone out before me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d expected I should have my Share of, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came amongst them.

<P>This struck me, and was worse to me, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they had laid their Fists on me, as they did

<MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> on others. I was troubled to think what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Matter was, or what these Rude People saw i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me, that made them not take me for a <HI>Quake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> And upon a close Examination of my self, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> respect to my Habit and Deportment, I coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not find any thing to place it on; but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had then on my Head a large <HI>Mountier-Cap</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Black Velvet, the Skirt of which being turne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up in Folds, looked (it seems) somewhat abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the then Common Garb of a <HI>Quaker:</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> put me out of Conceit with my Cap.</P>
<P>I came, at this time, to <HI>London</HI> from <HI>Isa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Penington</HI>'s, and thither I went again, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> way Home: and while I staid there, among other Friends who came thither, <HI>Thomas Loe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Oxford</HI> was one.

<P>When therefore I was come home, and had treated with a Neighbour for a Place to have a Meeting in, I wrote to my Friend <HI>Thomas Loe,</HI> to acquaint him, that I had procured a Place for a Meeting, and would invite Com∣pany to it; if he would fix the Time, and give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e some Ground to hope, that he would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it.</P>
<P>This Letter I sent by a Neighbour to <HI>Thame,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be given to a Dyer of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who constant∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y kept <HI>Thame</HI>-Market; with whom I was pretty well acquainted, having sometimes for∣merly used him, not only in his way of Trade, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut to carry Letters between my Brother and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, when he was a <HI>Student</HI> in that <HI>University:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r which he was always paid; and had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o careful in the Delivery, that our Letters had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lways gone safe, until now.

<P>The Occasion of this Stopping of Letters at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat time, was that mad Prank, of those in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atuated <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-Men,</HI> who from their Meeting-House in <HI>Coleman-Street, London,</HI> break∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng forth in Arms, (under the Command of

<P>The KING, a little before his Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> had, by his <HI>Declaration</HI> from <HI>Breda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> given Assurance of Liberty to <HI>Tender Conscience<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and that no Man should be disquieted, or called in Question for <HI>Differences of Opinion</HI> in Mat¦ters of <HI>Religion,</HI> who do not disturb the <HI>Peace o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Kingdom:</HI> Upon this Assurance <HI>Dissenters</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all sorts relied, and held themselves secur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But now, by this Frantick Action of a few ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brain'd Men, the King was, by some, holde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Discharged from this his ROYAL WORD an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> PROMISE, in his foregoing <HI>Declaration</HI> pub¦lickly given.

<MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> in <HI>Thame,</HI> having Confidence in me, that I would not give him the slip, jogged on, with∣out heeding how I followed him.</P>
<P>When I was gone about a Mile on the Way, I overtook my Father's Man; who (without my Knowledge) had followed me, at a distance, to <HI>Weston;</HI> and waited there, abroad in the Stables, till he understood, by some of the Servants, that I was to go to <HI>Oxford;</HI> and then ran before, resolving not to leave me, till he saw what they would do with me.</P>
<P>I would have had him return home; but he desired me not to send him back: but let him run on, till I came to <HI>Oxford.</HI> I considered that it was a Token of the Fellows affectionate Kindness to me; and that possibly I might send my Horse home by him: and thereupon, stopping my Horse, I bid him, if he would go on, Get up behind me. He modestly refused, telling me, <HI>He could run, as fast as I rid.</HI> But when I had told him, If he would not ride, he should not go forward; he, rather than leave me, leap'd up behind me, and on we went.</P>
<P>But he was not willing I should have gone at all. He had a great Cudgel in his Hand, and a strong Arm to use it; and being a stout Fellow, he had a great Mind to Fight the Trooper, and Rescue me. Wherefore he de∣sired me to turn my Horse, and and ride off. And if the Trooper offered to pursue, leave him to deal with him.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="121"/>
<MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"/> I check'd him sharply for that, and charged him to be quiet, and not think hardly of the poor Trooper; who could do no other, nor less than he did: and who, though he had an ill Journey, in going with me, carried himself civilly to me. I told him also, that I had no need to fly; for I had done nothing that would bring Guilt, or Fear upon me: neither did I go with an ill Will: and this quieted the Man. So on we went; but were so far cast behind the Trooper, that we had lost both Sight and Hearing of him; and I was fain to mend my Pace, to get up to him again.</P>
<P>We came pretty late into <HI>Oxford,</HI> on the Seventh Day of the Week, which was the Mar∣ket Day; and contrary to my Expectation (which was to have been carried to the Castle) my Trooper stop't in the <HI>High-Street;</HI> and cal∣ling at a Shop, asked for the Master of the House: who coming to the Door, he delivered to him the <HI>Mittimus,</HI> and with it a Letter from the Deputy-Lieutenants (or one of them;) which when he had read, he asked where the Prisoner was. Whereupon the Soldier, point∣ing to me, he desired me to alight and come in: which when I did, he received me civilly.</P>
<P>The Trooper, being discharged of his Pri∣soner, marched back: and my Father's Man, seeing me settled in better Quarters than he expected, mounted my Horse, and went off with him.</P>
<P>I did not presently understand the Quality of my Keeper: but I found him a genteel,

<P>Whether I was committed to him, out of Regard to my Father; that I might not be thrust into a Common Goal: or out of a Poli∣tick Design, to keep me from the Conversation of my Friends, in hopes that I might be draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to abandon this Profession, which I had but lately taken up; I do not know.

<P>It was quickly known in the City, that a <HI>Quaker</HI> was brought in Prisoner, and commit∣ted to the Marshall.

<MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="date"/> Wherefore he Examined all of us (whom he did not personally know) asking our Names, and the places of our Respective Habitations. But when he had them, and considered from what distant Parts of the Nation we came; he was amazed. For <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> was of <HI>Westmorland</HI> in the North of <HI>England;</HI> The <HI>Grocer</HI> was of <HI>Essex;</HI> I was of <HI>Oxfordshire;</HI> and <HI>W. Penington</HI> was of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon he told us, <HI>That our Case look't Ill, and he was sorry for it: for how</HI> (said he) <HI>can it be imagined that so many could jump altogether at one Time and Place, from such remote Quarters and Parts of the Kingdom; if it was not by Com∣bination and Appointment.</HI></P>
<P>He was Answered, That we were so far from coming thither by Agreement, or Appoint∣ment; that none of us knew of the others Coming, and for the most of us, we had never seen one another before: and that therefore he might impute it to <HI>Chance,</HI> or, if he pleased, to <HI>Providence.</HI></P>
<P>He urged upon us, <HI>That an Insurrection had been lately made by Armed Men, who pretended to be more Religious than others; that that Insurrect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣on had been Plotted and Contrived in their Meet∣ing-House, where they Assembled under Colour of Worshipping GOD; that in their Meeting-House they hid their Arms, and Armed themselves; and out of their Meeting-House issued forth in Arms, and killed many: so that the Government could not be safe, unless such Meetings were supprest.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="146"/>
<MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="date"/> We reply'd, We hoped he would distinguish, and make a Difference between the <HI>Guilty</HI> and the <HI>Innocent;</HI> and between those who were Principled for <HI>Fighting,</HI> and those who were Principled <HI>against it:</HI> which we were, and had been always known to be so. That our Meet∣ings were publick, our Doors standing open to all Comers, of all Ages, Sexes and Perswa∣sions; Men, Women and Children, and those that were not of our Religion, as well as those that were: and that it was next to Madness, for People to Plot in such Meetings.</P>
<P>He told us, <HI>We must find Sureties for our good Behaviour, and to Answer our Contempt of the King's Proclamation, at the next General Quarter-Sessions: or else he must Commit us.</HI></P>
<P>We told him, that knowing our Innocency, and that we had not mis-behaved our selves, nor did meet in Contempt of the King's Autho∣rity; but purely in obedience to the LORD's Requirings, to Worship Him, which we held our selves in Duty bound to do; we could not consent to be bound, for that would imply Guilt, which we were free from.</P>
<P><HI>Then,</HI> said he, <HI>I must commit you:</HI> And or∣dered his Clerk to make a <HI>Mittimus.</HI> And di∣vers <HI>Mittimusses</HI> were made, but none of them would hold: for still, when they came to be read, we found such Flaws in them, as made him through them aside, and write more.</P>
<P>He had his Eye often upon me: for I was a young Man, and had at that time a Black Suit on. At length he bid me follow him, and
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
<MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="date"/> went into a private Room, and shut the Door upon me.</P>
<P>I knew not what he meant by this: but I cryed in Spirit to the Lord, that He would be pleased to be a Mouth and Wisdom to me, and keep me from being Entangled in any Snare.</P>
<P>He asked me many Questions, concerning my Birth, my Education, my Acquaintance in <HI>Oxfordshire;</HI> particularly what Men of Note I knew there. To all which I gave him brief, but plain and true Answers; naming several Families, of the best Rank, in that Part of the Country where I dwelt.</P>
<P>He asked me, How long I had been of this Way, and how I came to be of it: Which when I had given him some Account of; he began to perswade me to leave it, and return to the right Way (the <HI>Church,</HI> as he called it.) I desired him to spare his Pains in that respect, and forbear any Discourse of that kind: for that I was fully satisfied, the Way I was in was the right Way; and hoped the Lord would so preserve me in it, that nothing should be able to draw, or drive me out of it. He seemed not pleased with that; and thereupon went out to the rest of the Company; and I follow∣ed him; glad in my Heart, that I had escaped so well, and Praising God for my Deliverance.</P>
<P>When he had taken his Seat again, at the upper End of a fair Hall, he told us, he was not willing to take the utmost Rigour of the Law against us; but would be as favourable
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
<MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="date"/> to us as he could. And therefore he would dis¦charge, he said, Mr. <HI>Penington</HI> himself, becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was but at Home in his own House. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he would discharge Mr. <HI>Penington</HI> of <HI>London<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> because he come but as a Relation, to visit hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brother. And he would discharge the <HI>Groce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>Colchester,</HI> because he came to bear Mr. <HI>Pen¦ington</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Company; and to be acquaint¦ed with Mr. <HI>Isaac Penington,</HI> whom he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never seen before. And as for those others o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us, who were of this Country, he would dis¦charge them, for the present at least, because they being his Neighbours, he could send for them when he would. <HI>But as for you,</HI> said he to <HI>George Whitehead</HI> and me, <HI>I can see no Busi∣ness you had there; and therefore I intend to hold you to it: either to Give Bayl, or Go to Jayl.</HI></P>
<P>We told him we could not give Bayl, <HI>Then,</HI> said he, <HI>You must go to Jayl;</HI> and there∣upon he began to write our <HI>Mittimus:</HI> which puzzled him again. For he had discharged so many, that he was at a Loss what to lay, as the Ground of our Commitment; whose Case differed nothing in Reality, from theirs whom he had discharged.</P>
<P>At length, having made divers Draughts (which still <HI>G. W.</HI> shewed him the Defects of) he seemed to be weary of us; and rising up said unto us, <HI>I consider that it is grown late in the Day, so that the Officer cannot carry you to</HI> Alesbury <HI>to Night; and I suppose you will be wil∣ling to go back with Mr.</HI> Penington: <HI>therefore if you will promise to be forth-coming at his House</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
<MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="date"/> <HI>to Morrow Morning, I will dismiss you for the pre∣sent; and you shall hear from me again to morrow.</HI></P>
<P>We told him, we did intend, if he did not otherwise dispose of us, to spend that Night with our Friend <HI>Isaac Penington;</HI> and would (if the LORD gave us leave) be there in the Morning, ready to Answer his Requirings. Whereupon he dismist us all, willing (as we thought) to be rid of us: for he seemed not to be of an ill Temper, nor desirous to put us to Trouble, if he could help it.</P>
<P>Back then we went to <HI>Isaac Penington</HI>'s. But when we were come thither, O the Work we had with poor <HI>John Ovy!</HI> He was so deject∣ed in Mind, so Covered with Shame and Con∣fusion of Face; for his Cowardliness, that we had enough to do to pacifie him towards him∣self.</P>
<P>The Place he had found out to Shelter him∣self in, was so commodiously contrived, that undiscovered he could discern when the Soldiers went off with us, and understand when the Bussle was over, and the Coast clear. Where∣upon he adventured to peep out of his Hole; and in a while drew near, by degrees, to the House again: and finding all things quiet and still, he adventured to step within the Doors, and found the Friends, who were left behind, peaceably fettled in the Meeting again.</P>
<P>The Sight of this smote him; and made him sit down among them. And after the Meeting was ended, and the <HI>Friends</HI> departed to their several Homes; addressing himself to
<PB N="144" REF="150"/>
<MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="date"/> <HI>Mary Penington</HI> (as the Mistress of the House) he could not enough magnifie the Bravery and Courage of the Friends: nor sufficiently debase himself. He told her how long he had been a Professor, what Pains he had taken, what Ha∣zards he had run, in his Youthful Days, to get to Meetings; how, when the Ways were forelaid, and Passages stop't, he Swam through Rivers to reach a Meeting: <HI>And now,</HI> sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> he, <HI>that I am grown Old in the Profession of Re∣ligion, and have long been an Instructor and En∣courager of others; that I should thus shamefully fall short my self; is matter of Shame and Sorrow to me.</HI></P>
<P>Thus he bewailed himself to her. And when we came back, he renewed his Com∣plaints of himself to us; with high Aggrava∣tions of his own Cowardice. Which gave Oc∣casion to some of the Friends, tenderly to re∣present to him the Difference between <HI>Profes∣sion</HI> and <HI>Possession, Form</HI> and <HI>Power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He was glad,</HI> he said, <HI>on our Behalfs, that we came off so well, and escaped Imprisonment.</HI></P>
<P>But when he understood that <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> and I were liable to an After-Reckoning next Morning; he was troubled: and wish't the Morning was come, and gone; that we might be gone with it.</P>
<P>We spent the Evening in grave Conversa∣tion, and in Religious Discourses; attributing the Deliverance me hitherto had to the LORD. And the next Morning when we were up, and had Eaten, we tarried some time to see what

<P>He, in Discourse, amongst other things, ask∣ed me, <HI>How it was with me as to Money?</HI> and <HI>how well I was furnished?</HI> I told him, I could not boast of much: and yet I could not say I had none (Though what I then had was indeed next to none.)

<P>On the <HI>Seventh Day</HI> he went down again (as he usually did) to his Brother's House at <HI>Chal∣font:</HI> and in Discourse gave them an Account of my Imprisonment.

<P>Not many Days after this, I received <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> from my Father; who being then at his House in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and, by Letter from my Sister, understanding that I was a Prisoner in <HI>Bridewell,</HI> sent this Money to me, for my Support there; and withal a Letter to my Si∣ster, for her to deliver to one called Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> (who lived near <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and was a Servant to Sir <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> in some Wharf of his, requesting him to interceed with his Master (who was one of the Governors of <HI>Bridewell</HI> for my Deliverance.

And indeed, that was, in a manner, the only Advantage I had by it: for my Master (though a very wealthy Man, and
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> one who professed not only Friendship, but par∣ticular Kindness to me) dealt, I thought, but hardly with me.

<P>About this time (while we were Prisoners in our fair Chamber) a Friend was brought and put in among us; who had been sent thither by <HI>Richard Brown</HI> to beat Hemp: whose Case was thus.</P>
<P>He was a very poor Man, who lived by Mending <HI>Shoos;</HI> and on a <HI>Seventh Day</HI> Night late, a Car-Man (or some other such labouring Man) brought him a pair of Shoos to mend, de∣siring him to mend them that Night, that he might have them in the Morning, for he had no other to wear.

<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bed; intending to do the rest in the Morning.</P>
<P>Accordingly he got up betimes; and though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e wrought as privately as he could in his Chamber, that he might avoid giving Offence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o any: yet could he not do it so privately, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat an ill-natur'd Neighbour perceived it, who went and informed against him for working on the <HI>Sunday.</HI> Whereupon he was had before <HI>Richard Brown;</HI> who Committed him to <HI>Bride∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ell</HI> for a certain time, to be kept to hard Labour, in Beating Hemp: which is Labour hard enough.</P>
<P>It so fell out, that at the same time were Committed thither (for what Cause I do not now remember) two lusty Young Men who were called <HI>Baptists,</HI> to be kept also at the same Labour.</P>
<P>The Friend was a poor little Man, of a low Condition, and mean Appearance: Whereas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese two Baptists were topping Blades, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooked high, and spake big.

<P>The Friend, on the other hand, acting upon a Principle, as knowing he had done no Evil, for which he should undergo that Punishment, refused to work; and for refusing was cruelly Whipt; which he bore with wonderful Con∣stancy, and Resolution of Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="182"/>

<P>With these Rods they tormented the Friend most barbarously; and the more, for that, hav¦ing mastered the Two braving, <HI>Baptists,</HI> they disdained to be mastered by this poor <HI>Quaker.</HI> Yet were they fain at last to yeild, when they saw their utmost Severity could not make him yield.

<PB N="182" REF="188"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> I believe did so. For there were many Sick; and some very weak: though we were not long there, yet in that time one of our Fellow Pri∣soners, who lay in one of those Pallet-Beds, died.</P>
<P>This caused some Bustle in the House. For the Body of the Deceased, being laid out, and put into a Coffin, was carried down, and set in the Room called the <HI>Lodge;</HI> that the <HI>Coroner</HI> might enquire into the Cause and Manner of his Death. And the manner of their doing it, is thus. As soon as the <HI>Coroner</HI> is come, the <HI>Turnkeys</HI> run out into the Street under the Gate; and seize upon every Man that passes by, till they have got enough to make up the <HI>Coroner's Inquest.</HI> And so resolute these rude Fellows are, that if any Man resist, or dispute it with them; they drag him in by main Force, not regarding what Condition he is of. Nay, I have been told, the will not stick to stop a Coach, and pluck the Men out of it.</P>
<P>It so happened, that at this time they lighted on an Ancient Man, a grave Citizen, who was trudging through the Gate in great Haste; and him they laid hold on, telling him <HI>He must come in, and serve upon the Coroner's Inquest.</HI> He pleaded hard, beg'd and besought them to let him go; assuring them <HI>He was going on very urgent Business, and that the stopping him would be greatly to his Prejudice.</HI> But they were deaf to all Intreaties; and hurried him in, the poor Man Chaffing without Remedy.</P>
<P>When they had got their Complement, and were shut in together, the rest of them said to
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> this Ancient Man, <HI>Come Father, you are the oldest Man among us: You shall be our Foreman.</HI> And when the <HI>Coroner</HI> had Sworn them on the Jury, the Coffin was uncovered, that they might ;ook upon the Body. But the Old Man, disturb∣ed in his Mind at the Interruption they had given him; was grown somewhat fretful upon it: said to them, <HI>To what purpose do you shew us a dead Body here! You would not have us think, sure, that this Man died in this Room? How then shall we be able to judge how this Man came by his Death, unless we see the Place wherein he died, and wherein he hath been kept Prisoner before he di∣ed? How know we, but that the Incommodiousness of the Place wherein he was kept, may have occasion∣ed his Death? Therefore shew us</HI> (said he) <HI>the place wherein this Man died.</HI></P>
<P>This much displeased the Keepers; and they began to banter the Old Man, thinking to have beaten him off it. But he stood up titely to them: <HI>Come, come,</HI> said he, <HI>Though you have made a Fool of me, in bringing me in hither; ye shall not find a Child of me, now I am here. Mis∣take not your selves: I understand my Place, and your Duty; and I require you to Conduct me, and my Brethren, to the Place where this Man died: Refuse it at your Peril.</HI></P>
<P>They now wished they had let the Old Man go about his Business, rather than by troubling him, have brought this Trouble on themselves. But when they saw he persisted in his Resolu∣tion, and was peremptory, the <HI>Coroner</HI> told them, <HI>They must go shew him the Place.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="190"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> It was in the Evening when they began this Work; and by this time it was grown Bed-time with us: so that we had taken down our Ham∣macks (which in the Day were hung up by the Walls) and had made them ready to go into; and were undressing our selves in Readiness to go into them. When on a suddain we heard a great Noise of Tongues, and of Tramplings of Feet, coming up towards us. And by and by One of the <HI>Turnkeys,</HI> opening our Door, said, <HI>Hold, hold, Don't undress your selves, here's the Coroner's Inquest coming to see you.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as they were come to the Door (for within the Door there was scarce room for them to come) the Foreman, who led them, lifting up his Hand, said, <HI>Lord bless me, what a Sight is here! I did not think there had been so much Cruel∣ty in the Hearts of</HI> Englishmen, <HI>to use</HI> English∣men <HI>in this manner! We need not now question</HI> (said he to the rest of the Jury) <HI>how this Man came by his Death: We may rather wonder that they are not all dead: for this Place is enough to breed an Infection among them. Well,</HI> added he, <HI>If it please God to lengthen my Life till to Morrow, I will find means to let the</HI> KING <HI>know how his Subjects are dealt with.</HI></P>
<P>Whether he did so, or no; I cannot tell; but I am apt to think that he applied himself to the Mayor, or the Sheriffs of <HI>London.</HI> For the next Day, one of the Sheriffs (called Sir <HI>William Turner,</HI> a <HI>Wollen-Draper</HI> in <HI>Paul's-Yard</HI>) came to the Press-Yard; and having ordered the Porter of <HI>Bridewell</HI> to attend him there; sent up a
<PB N="185" REF="191"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> <HI>Turnkey</HI> amongst us, to bid all the <HI>Bridewell</HI> Prisoners come down to him: for they knew us not; but we knew our own Company.</P>
<P>Being come before him, in the Press-Yard, he looked kindly on us, and spake courteously to us. <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> said he, <HI>I understand the Pri∣son is very full; and I am sorry for it. I wish it were in my Power to release you, and the rest of your Friends that are in it. But since I cannot do that, I am willing to do what I can for you. And there∣fore I am come hither to enquire how it is; and I would have all you, who came from</HI> Bridewell, <HI>re∣turn thither again; which will be a better Accom∣modation to you: and your Removal will give the more room to those that are left behind; and here is the Porter of</HI> Bridewell, <HI>your Old Keeper, to at∣tend you thither.</HI></P>
<P>We duly acknowledged the Favour of the Sheriff, to us and our Friends above, in this Re∣moval of us; which would give them more Room, and us a better Air. But before we parted from him, I spake particularly to him, on another Occasion: which was this.</P>
<P>When we came into <HI>Newgate,</HI> we found a shabby Fellow there, among the <HI>Friends;</HI> who (upon Inquiry) we understood had thrust him∣self among our Friends, when they were taken at a Meeting, on purpose to be sent to Prison with them; in hopes to be maintained by them. They knew nothing of him, till they found him shut in with them in the Prison: and then took no Notice of him, as not knowing how or why he came thither. But he soon gave
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> them cause to take Notice of him: for where¦ever he saw any Victuals brought forth fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them to Eat; he would be sure to thrust in with Knife in hand, and make himself his own Carver, And so impudent was he, that if he saw the Provision was short; whoever wanted<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he would be sure to take enough.</P>
<P>Thus lived this lazy Drone upon the Labours of the Industrious Bees; to his high Content, and their no small Trouble: to whom his Com∣pany was as Offensive, as his Ravening was Oppressive: nor could they get any Relief, by their complaining of him to the Keepers.</P>
<P>This Fellow, hearing the Notice which was given, for the <HI>Bridewell</HI>-Men to go down, in order to be removed to <HI>Bridewell</HI> again; and hoping (no Doubt) that fresh Quarters would produce fresh Commons, and that he should fare better with us, than where he was: thrust himself amongst us; and went down into the Press Yard with us. Which I knew not of, till I saw him standing there, with his Hat on; and looking as demurely as he could, that the Sheriff might take him for a <HI>Quaker:</HI> at Sight of which, my Spirit was much stirred.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as soon as the Sheriff had done speaking to us, and we had made our Acknow∣ledgment of his Kindness; I stept a little nearer to him, and pointing to that Fellow, said, That Man is not only none of our Company, for he is no <HI>Quaker:</HI> but is an idle dissolute Fellow, who hath thrust himself in among our Friends, to be sent to Prison with them, that he might
<PB N="187" REF="193"/>

<P>At this the Sheriff smiled; and calling the Fellow forth, said to him, <HI>How came you to be in Prison?</HI> I was taken at a Meeting, said he, <HI>But what Business had you there?</HI> said the Sheriff. I went to hear, said he. <HI>Aye, you went upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rse Design, it seems,</HI> replied the Sheriff; <HI>but I'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> disappoint you,</HI> said he: <HI>for I'll change your Company; and send you to them that are like your self.</HI> Then calling for the <HI>Turnkey,</HI> he said, <HI>Take this Fellow, and put him among the Felons; and be sure let him not trouble the Quakers any more.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto this Fellow had stood with his Hat on, as willing to have passed (if he could) for a <HI>Quaker;</HI> but as soon as he heard this Doom passed on him, off went his Hat: and to bow∣ing and scraping he fell, with <HI>Good your Worship have pity upon me, and set me at Liberty. No, no,</HI> said the Sheriff, <HI>I will not so far disappoint you: since you had a Mind to be in Prison, in Prison you shall be for me.</HI> Then bidding, the Turnkey take him away; he had him up, and put him among the Felons: and so Friends had a good Deliver∣ance from him.</P>
<P>The Sheriff then bidding us Farewel, the Porter of <HI>Bridewell</HI> came to us, and told us, <HI>We know our Way to</HI> Bridewell <HI>without him; and he could trust us: therefore he would not stay nor go with us; but left us to take our own time; so we were in before Bed-time.</HI></P>
<P>Then went we up again to our Friends in <HI>Newgate;</HI> and gave them an Account of what
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> had passed: and having taken a solemn Leav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them; we made up our Packs to be gone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But before I pass from <HI>Newgate,</HI> I think it no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> amiss, to give the Reader some little Accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of what I Observed while I was there.</P>
<P>The common Side of <HI>Newgate</HI> is generally accounted, as it really is, the Worst part of that Prison; not so much from the Place, as the People: it being usually stocked with the veri∣est Rogues, and meanest sort of Felons, and Pick-Pockets; who not being able to pay Cham∣ber-Rent on the Master's Side, are thrust in there. And if they come in Bad, to be sure they do not go out better: for here they have an Opportunity to instruct one another in their Art; and impart each to other what Improve∣ments they have made therein.</P>
<P>The Common Hall (which is the first Room over the Gate) is a good Place to walk in, when the Prisoners are out of it (saving the danger of catching some Cattle, which they may have left in it:) and there I used to walk in a Morning, before they were let up; and sometimes in the Day time, when they have been there.</P>
<P>They all carried themselves respectfully to∣wards me; which I imputed chiefly to this, That when any of our Women-Friends came there to Visit the Prisoners, if they had not Re∣lations of their own there, to take care of them: I, (as being a young Man, and more at leisure than most others, for I could not play the <HI>Taylor</HI> there) was forward to go down with them to
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> the Grate, and see them safe out. And some∣times they have left Money in my Hands for the Felons (who at such times were very im∣portunate Beggars:) which I forthwith distri∣buted among them in Bread; which was to be had in the Place. But so troublesome an Office it was, that I thought one had as good have had a Pack of hungry Hounds about one, as these when they knew there was a Dole to be given. Yet this, I think, made them a little the more observant to me; for they would dis∣pose themselves to one side of the Room, that they might make way for me to walk on the o∣ther. And when I walked there, I had usually a Book in my Hand; on which I had mine Eye: which made them think I did not heed what they said. By this Means, mine Ear be∣ing attentive to them, I heard them relate one to another many of their Roguish Pranks.</P>
<P>One Day, as I was thus walking to and fro beside them, I heard them recounting one to another what feats they had done at <HI>Pocket-picking</HI> and <HI>Shop-lifting.</HI> Whereupon, turning short upon them, I asked them, Which of you all will undertake to pick my Pocket? They were not very forward to Answer; but viewed me round. I wore a long Gown, which was lap't over before, and tied about the Middle; and had no Pocket-Holes in it. When they had a while considered it, and I (having taken another Turn) was come up again to them, One of them said, <HI>Why, Master, If you will Pro∣mise not to Prosecute us, we will show you a Piece</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> <HI>of our Skill.</HI> Nay, hold there, said I, I won<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> so far encourage you in Evil, as to promise no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to prosecute: and away I turned again; hav¦ing mine Eye on my Book; but mine Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to them. And in a while I heard them contriv¦ing how they would have done it. <HI>I,</HI> said one of them, <HI>would give him the Budge; and before he can recover himself, you</HI> (said he to another of them) <HI>having your Penknife ready, should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Gown; and then</HI> (said he) <HI>let</HI> Honeypot <HI>alone for the diving Part.</HI> This <HI>Honeypot</HI> was a little Boy (then in Prison with them for Picking a Pocket) who, by his Stature, did not seem to be above Ten, or a Dozen Years old: but for his Dexterity at <HI>Pocket-picking,</HI> was held to be one of the top of the Trade. As for the <HI>Budg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> I had had it given me often in the Street; but understood not the Meaning of it till now; and now I found it was a Jostle, enough to throw one almost upon his Nose.</P>
<P>I have sometimes occasionally been in the Hall in an Evening; and have seen the Whores let in unto them (which I take to be a common Practice:) Nasty Sluts indeed they were; and in that respect the more suitable. And as I have passed by them, I have heard the Rogues and they making their Bargains, which and which of them should Company together that Night. Which abominable Wickedness must be imputed to the Dishonesty of the <HI>Turnkeys;</HI> who, for vile Gain to themselves, not only suf∣fer, but further this Leudness.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="197"/>
<MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="date"/> These are some of the common Evils, which make the Common Side of <HI>Newgate,</HI> in mea∣sure a Type of <HI>HELL</HI> upon <HI>EARTH.</HI> But there was, at that time, something of ano∣ther Nature, more Particular and Accidental, which was very Offensive to me.</P>
<P>When we came first into <HI>Newgate,</HI> there lay in a little By-place like a Closet, near the Room where we were Lodged) the Quartered Bodies of three Men; who had been Executed some Days before, for a real or pretended Plot: which was the Ground, or at least Pretext, for that Storm in the City, which had caused this Imprisonment. The Names of these three Men were <HI>Philips, Tongue</HI> and <HI>Gibs:</HI> and the Reason why their Quarters lay so long there was, The Relations were all that while Petitioning to have leave to bury them: which at length with much ado was obtained for the Quarters; but not for the Heads, which were Ordered to be set up in some Parts of the City.</P>
<P>I saw the Heads, when they were brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p to be Boyled. The Hangman fetch'd them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a dirty Dust Basket, out of some By-Place; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd setting them down amongst the Felons, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd they made Sport with them. They took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem by the Hair, Flouting, Jeering and Laugh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng at them: and then giving them some ill Names, box'd them on the Ears and Cheeks. Which done, the Hangman put them into his Kettle, and parboyl'd them with <HI>Bay-Salt</HI> and <HI>Cummin-Seed:</HI> that to keep them from Putre∣faction, and this to keep off the Fowls from

The whole Sight (as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> that of the Bloody Quarters first, as this of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heads afterwards) was both frightful an loathsom; and begat an Abhorrence in my Na¦ture. Which as it had rendered my Confine¦ment there by much the more uneasie: so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made our Removal from thence to <HI>Bridewell</HI> even in that respect, the more welcome. Whi¦ther we now go.</P>
<P>For having (as I hinted before) made up our Packs, and taken our Leave of our <HI>Friends,</HI> whom we were to leave behind; we took our Bundles on our Shoulders, and walked, Two and Two a Breast, through the <HI>Old Baily</HI> into <HI>Fleet-Street,</HI> and so to <HI>Old Bridewell.</HI> And it being about the middle of the Afternoon, and the Streets pretty full of People; both the Shop¦keepers at their Doors, and Passengers in the Way, would stop us, and ask us what we were, and whither we were going. And when we had told them we were Prisoners, going from one Prison to another (from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Bride¦well</HI>) <HI>What,</HI> said they, <HI>without a Keeper!</HI> No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said we, for our Word, which we have given<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is our Keeper. Some thereupon would advis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us not to go to Prison, but to go home. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we told them, we could not do so: we coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suffer for our Testimony; but could not fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from it.

<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> And this Priviledge we enjoyed, by the Indul∣gence of our Keeper, whose Heart God disposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Favour us. So that both the Master and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orter were very civil, and kind to us; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad been so indeed all along.

<P>This he observed, and asked me when I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eant to ask to go out. I told him, I had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch Occasion, nor Desire; yet at sometime or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther, perhaps, I might have: but when I had, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would ask him but once; and if he then de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed me, I would ask him no more.</P>
<P>After we were come back from <HI>Newgate,</HI> I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad a Desire to go thither again, to visit my <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riends</HI> who were Prisoners there; more espe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ially my dear Friend (and Father in <HI>Christ</HI>) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dward Burrough,</HI> who was then a Prisoner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith many <HI>Friends</HI> more, in that Part of <HI>New∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate,</HI> which was then called <HI>Justice-Hall.</HI> Whereupon the Porter coming in my way, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sked him to let me go out for an Hour or two, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o see some <HI>Friends</HI> of mine that Evening.</P>

<P><PB N="216" REF="222"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> He was no sooner gone out of my Sight, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I espied his Master crossing the Court. Where¦fore stepping to him, I asked him, If he was willing to let me go out for a little while, to see some Friends of mine that Evening. <HI>Yes,</HI> said he, <HI>very willing;</HI> and thereupon away walk∣ed I to <HI>Newgate;</HI> where having spent the Even∣ing among <HI>Friends,</HI> I returned in good time.</P>
<P>Under this easie Restraint we lay, till the Court sate at the <HI>Old-Baily</HI> again: And then, whether it was that the Heat of the Storm was somewhat abated, or by what other means Pro∣vidence wrought it, I know not; we were called to the Bar, and without further Question, discharged.</P>
<P>Whereupon we returned to <HI>Bridewell</HI> again, and having raised some Monies among us, and therewith gratified both the Master and his Por∣ter, for their Kindness to us; we spent some∣time in a solemn Meeting, to return our thank∣ful Acknowledgement to the LORD, both for His Preservation of us in Prison, and Deliver∣ance of us out of it: and then taking a solemn Farewel of each other, we departed with Bag and Baggage. And I took care to return my Hammack to the Owner; with due Acknow∣ledgement of his great Kindness, in lending it me.</P>
<P>Being now at Liberty, I visited more gene∣rally my Friends that were still in Prison; and more particularly my Friend and Benefactor, <HI>William Penington,</HI> at his House: and then went to wait upon my Master <HI>Milton.</HI> With whom
<PB N="217" REF="223"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> yet I could not propose to enter upon my inter∣mitted Studies, until I had been in <HI>Buckingham∣shire,</HI> to visit my worthy Friends <HI>Isaac Penington,</HI> and his Virtuous Wife; with other Friends in that Country.</P>
<P>Thither therefore I betook my self, and the Weather being Frosty, and the Ways, by that means, clean and good; I walked it thorow in a Day: and was received by my Friends there, with such Demonstration of hearty Kindness, as made my Journey very easie to me.</P>
<P>I had spent in my Imprisonment that Twen∣ty Shillings, which I had received of <HI>William Penington;</HI> and Twenty of the Fourty, which had been sent me from <HI>Mary Penington,</HI> and had the Remainder then about me. That therefore I now returned to her, with due Acknowledge∣ment of her Husband's and her great Care of me, and Liberality to me, in the time of my Need. She would have had me kept it. But I beg'd her to accept it from me again; since it was the Redundancy of their Kindness, and the other Part had answered the Occasion, for which it was sent: and my Importunity pre∣vailed.</P>
<P>I intended only a Visit hither, not a Conti∣nuance: and therefore purposed, after I had staid a few Days, to return to my Lodging, and former Course in <HI>London:</HI> but Providence ordered it otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>Isaac Penington</HI> had at that time two Sons and one Daughter (all then very young) of whom the Eldest Son <HI>(John Penington)</HI> and the
<PB N="218" REF="224"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> Daughter <HI>(Mary,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Daniel Wharley)</HI> are yet living at the writing of this. And being himself both Skilful and Curious in <HI>Pronouncia∣tion;</HI> he was very desirous to have them well grounded in the <HI>Rudiments of the English Tongue:</HI> to which End he had sent for a Man out of <HI>Lan∣cashire</HI> (whom, upon enquiry, he had heard of) who was undoubtedly the most accurate <HI>Eng∣lish Teacher,</HI> that ever I met with, or have heard of. His Name was <HI>Richard Bradley.</HI> But as he pretended no higher than the <HI>English Tongue;</HI> and had led them, by <HI>Grammar Rules,</HI> to the highest Improvement they were capable of in that: he had then taken his Leave of them, and was gone up to <HI>London,</HI> to Teach an <HI>English School</HI> of <HI>Friends</HI> Children there.</P>
<P>This put my Friend to a fresh Straight. He had sought for a New Teacher, to instruct his Children in the <HI>Latin Tongue,</HI> as the Old had done in the <HI>English:</HI> but had not yet found one. Wherefore one Evening as we sate together by the Fire in his Bed-Chamber (which, for want of Health, he kept) He asked me (his Wife being by) <HI>If I would be so kind to him, as to stay a while with him, till he could hear of such a Man as he aimed at; and in the mean time enter his Chil∣dren in the Rudiments of the</HI> Latin Tongue.</P>
<P>This Question was not more unexpected, than surprizing to me; and the more, because it seemed directly to thwart my former Pur∣pose, and Undertaking, of endeavouring to improve my self by following my Studies with my Master <HI>Milton:</HI> which this would give at
<PB N="219" REF="225"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> least a present Divertion from; and for how long I could not foresee.</P>
<P>But the Sense I had of the manifold Obliga∣tions I lay under to these worthy Friends of mine, shut out all Reasonings; and disposed my Mind to an absolute Resignation to their Desire; that I might testifie my Gratitude, by a Willingness to do them any friendly Service, that I could be capable of.</P>
<P>And though I questioned my Ability to carry on that Work, to its due Height and Propor∣tion; yet as that was not proposed, but an Initiation only, by <HI>Accidence</HI> into <HI>Grammar:</HI> I consented to the Proposal, as a present Ex∣pedient (till a more qualified Person should be found;) without further Treaty, or mention of Terms between us, than that of mutual Friendship. And to render this Digression from my own Studies the less uneasie to my Mind, I recollected (and often thought of) that Rule in <HI>Lilly,</HI><Q><L><HI>Qui docet indoctos, licet indoctissimus esset,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ipse brevi reliquis doctior esse queat.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>He that th' Unlearn'd doth teach, may quickly be</L>
<L>More Learn'd than they, though most Unlearned He.</L></Q></P>
<P>With this Consideration I undertook this Province; and left it not until I Married: which was not till the Year 1669, near Seven
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
<MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"/> Years from the time I came thither. In which time, having the Use of my Friends Books, as well as of mine own, I spent my leasure Hours much in Reading; not without some improve∣ment to my self in my private Studies: which (with the good Success of my Labours bestow∣ed on the Children, and the Agreeableness of Conversation, which I found in the Family;) rendered my Undertaking more Satisfactory, and my Stay there more easie to me.</P>
<P>But, alas! not many Days (not to say Weeks) had I been there; e're we were almost over∣whelmed with Sorrow, for the unexpected Loss of <HI>Edward Burrough,</HI> who was justly very dear to us all.</P>
<P>This not only Good, but Great-good Man, by a long and close Confinement in <HI>Newgate,</HI> through the Cruel Malice, and Malicious Cru∣elty of <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> was taken away by hasty Death, to the unutterable Grief of very many, and unspeakable Loss to the CHURCH of CHRIST in general.</P>
<P>The particular Obligation I had to him as the immediate Instrument of my Convince∣ment; and high Affection for him, resulting therefrom, did so deeply affect my Mind; that it was some pretty time, before my Passion could prevail, to express it self in Words: so true I found that of the <HI>Tragoedian,</HI>

<P>We had been there but a very little time, be∣fore I was sent to Prison again, upon this Occa∣sion.

<P>When he had taken what Number of Names he thought fit, he singled out half a Dozen; whereof <HI>Morgan</HI> was one, I another, One Man more, and three Women: of which the Wo∣man of the House was one, although her Hus∣band then was (and for divers Years before had been) a Prisoner in the <HI>Fleet</HI> for Tythes, and had no body to take care of his Family and Bu∣siness, but her his Wife.</P>
<P>Us six he committed to <HI>Alesbury</HI> Goal.

<P><MILESTONE N="1666" UNIT="date"/> We were committed on the Thirteenth Day of the Month called <HI>March,</HI> 1665. and were kept close Prisoners there till the Seventh Day of the Month called <HI>June,</HI> 1666; which was some Days above Twelve Weeks: and much above what the Act required.</P>
<P>Then were we sent for to the Justices House, and the rest being Released, <HI>Morgan Watkins</HI> and I were required to find Sureties, for our Ap∣pearance at the next <HI>Assize;</HI> which we refusing to do, were committed a-new to our old Prison (the <HI>House of Correction</HI> at <HI>Wiccomb</HI>) there to lie until the next <HI>Assizes: Morgan</HI> being, in this se∣cond <HI>Mittimus,</HI> represented as a <HI>Notorious Offen∣der in Preaching;</HI> and I, as being upon the <HI>second Conviction, in order to Banishment.</HI> There we ay, till the Five and Twentieth Day of the same Month; and then, by the Favour of the Earl of <HI>Ancram,</HI> being brought before him at his House, we were discharged from the Prison, upon our Promise to appear (if at Liberty and in Health) at the <HI>Assizes.</HI> Which we did, and were there discharged by Proclamation.</P>
<P>During my Imprisonment in this Prison, I betook my self, for an Imployment, to making of Nets for Kitchin-Service, to boil Herbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in; which Trade I learned of <HI>Morgan Watkins,</HI>

<P>Though in that Confinement I was not very well suited with Company for Conversation; <HI>Morgan</HI>'s natural Temper not being very agree∣able to mine: yet we kept a fair and Brother∣ly Correspondence, as became Friends, Pri∣son-fellows and Bed-fellows; which we were. And indeed, it was a good Time, I think to us all; for I found it so to me; the Lord being graciously pleased to visit my Soul with the re∣freshing Dews of his divine Life, whereby my Spirit was more and more quickned to him, and Truth gained ground in me over the Temptations and Snares of the Enemy. Which frequently raised in my Heart Thanksgivings and Praises unto the LORD.

<P>After we had been discharged at the <HI>Assizes,</HI> I returned to <HI>Isaac Penington</HI>'s Family at <HI>Bottrel</HI>'s in <HI>Chalfont;</HI> and (as I remember) <HI>Morgan Wat∣kins</HI> with me: leaving <HI>Isaac Penington</HI> a Priso∣ner in <HI>Alesbury</HI> Goal.</P>
<P>The Lodgings we had in this Farm-House (<HI>Bottrel</HI>'s) proving too strait and inconvenient for the Family, I took larger and better Lodg∣ings for them in <HI>Berrie-House</HI> at <HI>Amersham;</HI> whi∣ther we went at the time called <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> having spent the Summer at the other Place.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1667" UNIT="date"/> Some time after, was that memorable Meet∣ing appointed to be holden at <HI>London,</HI> through a divine Opening, in the Motion of Life, in that eminent Servant and Prophet of God,
<PB N="254" REF="262"/>
<MILESTONE N="1667" UNIT="date"/> <HI>George Fox;</HI> for the Restoring, and bringing in again those, who had gone out from Truth, and the Holy Unity of Friends therein, by the Means and Ministry of <HI>John Perrot.</HI></P>
<P>This Man came pretty early amongst <HI>Friends,</HI> and too early took upon him the Ministerial Office: and being, though little in Person, yet great in Opinion of himself, nothing less would serve him than to go and Convert the POPE: In order whereunto, he (having a better Man than himself, <HI>John Luff,</HI> to accompany him) travelled to <HI>Rome,</HI> where they had not been long, e're they were taken up, and clap't into Prison; <HI>Luff</HI> (as I remember) was put in the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> and <HI>Perrot</HI> in their <HI>Bedlam,</HI> or Hos∣pital for Madmen.</P>
<P><HI>Luff</HI> died in Prison (not without well-ground∣ed Suspicion of being Murthered there) but <HI>Perrot</HI> lay there some time, and now and then sent over an Epistle to be Printed here, written in such an affected and phantastick Stile, as might have induced an indifferent Reader to believe, they had suited the place of his Con∣finement to his Condition.</P>
<P>After some time, through the Mediation of Friends (who hoped better of him, than he proved) with some Person of Note and Interest there, he was released, and came back for <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> And the Report of his great Sufferings there (far greater in Report, than in Reality) joined with a singular Shew of Sanctity, so far opened the Hearts of many tender and com∣passionate Friends towards him, that it gave
<PB N="255" REF="263"/>
<MILESTONE N="1667" UNIT="date"/> im the Advantage of insinuating himself in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o their Affections and Esteem, and made way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the more ready Propagation of that peculiar Error of his, of <HI>Keeping on the Hat in time of Prayer, as well publick as private, unless they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> immediate Motion at that time to put if off.</HI></P>
<P>Now although I had not the least Acquaint∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce with this Man, not having ever exchanged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Word with him (though I knew him by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight;) nor had I any Esteem of him for either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Natural Parts, or Ministerial Gift, but ra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her a Dislike of his Aspect, Preaching and way of Writing; yet this Error of his being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roached in the Time of my Infancy, and Weakness of Judgment as to Truth (while I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived privately in <HI>London,</HI> and had little Con∣verse with Friends.) I, amongst the many who were catch't in that Snare, was taken with the Notion, as what then seemed, to my weak Understanding, suitable to the Doctrine of a Spiritual Dispensation. And the Matter com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng to warm Debates, both in Words and Wri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, I, in a misguided Zeal, was ready to have entred the Lists of Contention about it: not then seeing what Spirit it proceeded from, and was managed by; nor forseeing the Dis∣order and Confusion in Worship, which must naturally attend it.</P>
<P>But as I had no evil Intention, or sinister End in engaging in it; but was simply betrayed by the specious Pretence and Shew of greater Spi∣rituality: the Lord, in tender Compassion to my Soul, was graciously pleased to open my
<PB N="256" REF="264"/>
<MILESTONE N="1667" UNIT="date"/> Understanding, and give me a clear Sight of the Enemies Design in this Work, and drew me off from the Practice of it, and to bear Testimony against it, as Occasion offered.</P>
<P>But when that solemn Meeting was appoint∣ed at <HI>London,</HI> for a Travel in Spirit on behalf of those who had thus gone out, that they might rightly return, and be sensibly received into the Unity of the Body again. My Spirit re∣joyced, and with Gladness of Heart I went to it: as did many more of both City and Coun∣try; and with great Simplicity, and Humility of Mind, did honestly and openly Acknow∣ledge our Outgoing, and take Condemnation and Shame to our selves. And some that lived at too remote a Distance, in this Nation as well as beyond the Seas, upon Notice given of that Meeting, and the intended Service of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did the like by Writing, in Letters directed to and openly read in the Meeting, which for that Purpose was continued many Days.</P>
<P>Thus, in the Motion of Life, were the heal∣ing Waters stirred; and many through the Virtuous Power thereof, restored to Soundness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and indeed not many lost. And though most of these, who thus returned, were such as with my self, had before renounced the Error<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and forsaken the Practice: yet did we sensibly find, that Forsaking without Confessing (in Case of publick Scandal) was not sufficient<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but that an open Acknowledgment (of ope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Offences) as well as Forsaking them, was ne¦cessary to the obtaining compleat Remission.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="265"/>
<MILESTONE N="1667" UNIT="date"/> Not long after this, <HI>G.

<P><MILESTONE N="6618" UNIT="date"/> When he came into this County, I was one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the many Friends that were with him, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Meeting for that Purpose. And afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> travelled with <HI>Guli</HI> and her Maid, into the West of <HI>England</HI> to meet him there, and to visit Friends in those Parts: and we went as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar as <HI>Topsham</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> before we found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im.

<MILESTONE N="1668" UNIT="date"/> Practice of keeping on his Hat in time of Prayer, to the great Trouble and Offence of Friends) began to Cavil, and raise Disputes, which occasioned some Interruption and Dis∣turbance.</P>
<P>Not only <HI>George,</HI> and <HI>Alexander Parker</HI> (who was with him) but divers of the Ancient Friends of that Country, endeavoured to quiet that troublesom Man, and make him sensible of his Error: but his unruly Spirit would still be Opposing what was said unto him, and ju∣stifying himself in that Practice. This brought a great Weight and Exercise upon me (who sate at a Distance in the outward Part of the Meeting:) and after I had for some time bore the Burthen thereof, I stood up in the constrain∣ing Power of the LORD, and in great Ten∣derness of Spirit, declared unto the Meeting, and to that Person more particularly, how it had been with me in that respect; how I had been betrayed into that wrong Practice, how strong I had been therein, and how the Lord had been graciously pleased to shew me the Evil thereof, and recover me out of it.</P>
<P>This coming unexpectedly from me, a young Man, a Stranger, and one who had not inter∣medled with the Business of the Meeting, had that Effect upon the Caviller, that if it did not satisfie him, it did at least silence him, and made him for the Present sink down and be still, without giving any further Disturbance to the Meeting. And the Friends were well pleased with this unlooked for Testimony from me;
<PB N="259" REF="267"/>
<MILESTONE N="1668" UNIT="date"/> and I was glad that I had that Opportunity to Confess to the Truth, and to Acknowledge once more, in so publick a manner, the Mercy and Goodness of the Lord to me therein.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"/> By the time we came back from this Journey, the Summer was pretty far gone, and the fol∣lowing Winter I spent with the Children of the Family as before, without any remarkable Alteration in my Circumstances, until the next Spring: when I found in my self a Dispo∣sition of Mind, to change my Single Life for a Married State.</P>
<P>I had always entertained so high a Regard for Marriage, as it was a Divine Institution, that I held it not lawful to make it a sort of political Trade to rise in the World by. And therefore as I could not but, in my Judgment, blame such, as I found made it their Business to Hunt after, and endeavour to gain those who were accounted great <HI>Fortunes;</HI> not so much re∣garding <HI>What she is,</HI> as <HI>what she has,</HI> but mak∣ing Wealth the chief, if not the only thing they Aimed at: so I resolved to avoid, in my own Practice, that Course; and how much so∣ever my Condition might have prompted me (as well as others) to seek Advantage that way, never to engage on the Account of <HI>Riches,</HI> nor at all to Marry, till judicious Affection drew me to it, which I now began to feel at Work in my Breast.</P>
<P>The Object of this Affection was a Friend (whose Name was <HI>Mary Ellis</HI>) whom for divers Years I had had an Acquaintance with, in the
<PB N="260" REF="268"/>
<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"/> way of common Friendship only; and in whom I thought I then saw those fair Prints of Truth and solid Virtue, which I afterwards found in a sublime Degree, in her: but what her Con∣dition in the World was, as to Estate, I was wholly a Stranger to, nor desired to know.</P>
<P>I had once, a Year or two before, had an Opportunity to do her a small Piece of Service, which she wanted some Assistance in: wherein I acted with all Sincerity, and Freedom of Mind, not expecting, or desiring any Advan∣tage by her, or Reward from her; being very well satisfied in the Act it self, that I had served a Friend, and helped the Helpless.</P>
<P>That little Intercourse of common Kindness between us Ended, without the least Though (I am verily perswaded, on her Part; well-as¦sured on my own) of any other or further Re¦lation, than that of free and fair Friendship Nor did it, at that time, lead us into any close Conversation, or more intimate Acquaintan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one with the other, than had been before.</P>
<P>But some time (and that a good while) a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ter, I found my Heart secretly drawn, and in¦clining towards her: Yet was I not hasty i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proposing; but waited to feel a satisfactory Set¦tlement of Mind therein, before I made an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> step thereto.</P>
<P>After some time, I took an Opportunity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> open my Mind therein unto my much honou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ed Friends, <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Mary Penington,</HI> who th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> stood <HI>Parentum loco,</HI> in the Place or Stead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parents to me.

<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"/> the Matter, exprest their Unity therewith: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd indeed their Approbation thereof was no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall Confirmation to me therein. Yet took I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urther Deliberation, often retiring in Spirit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Lord, and Crying to him for Direction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore I addrest my self to her. At length, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s I was sitting all alone, waiting upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord for Counsel and Guidance in this (in it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>lf, and) to me so important Affair. I felt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Word sweetly rise in me, as if I had heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Voice, which said, <HI>Go, and Prevail.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ith springing in my Heart with the Word, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immediately arose and went; nothing doubt∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>g.</P>
<P>When I was come to her Lodgings (which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere about a Mile from me) her Maid told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e she was in her Chamber (for having been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>der some Indisposition of Body, which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>liged her to keep her Chamber, she had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t left it.)

And after some little time spent in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>mmon Conversation, feeling my Spirit weigh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y concerned, I solemnly opened my Mind un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> her, with respect to the particular Business <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ame about; which I soon perceived was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eat Surprisal to her for she had taken in an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pprehension (as others also had done) that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine Eye had been fixed elsewhere, and nearer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome.</P>
<P>I used not many Words to her: but I felt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Divine Power went along with the Words,
<PB N="262" REF="270"/>
<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"/> and fixed the Matter expressed by them so fast in her Breast, that (as she afterwards acknow∣ledged to me) she could not shut it out.</P>
<P>I made, at that time, but a short Visit. For having told her, I did not expect an Answer from her now; but desired she would, in the most solemn Manner, weigh the Proposal made, and in due time give me such an Answer there∣unto, as the Lord should give her: I took my leave of her, and departed; leaving the Issue to the Lord.</P>
<P>I had a Journey then at hand, which I fore∣saw would take me up about two Weeks time. Wherefore, the Day before I was to set out, I went to visit her again; to acquaint her with my Journey, and excuse my Absence: not yet pressing her for an Answer; but assuring her, that I felt in my self an Increase of Affection to her, and hoped to receive a suitable Re∣turn from her in the Lord's time; to whom, in the mean time, I committed both her, my self and the Concern between us. And indeed, I found at my Return, that I could not have left it in a better Hand: for the Lord had been my Advocate in my Absence, and had so far answered all her Objections, that, when I came to her again, she rather acquainted me with them, than urged them.</P>
<P>From that time forwards we Entertained each other with Affectionate Kindness in order to Marriage; which yet we did not hasten to, but went on deliberately. Neither did I use those vulgar ways of Courtship, by making
<PB N="263" REF="271"/>
<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>requent and rich Presents: Not only for that my Outward Condition would not comport with the Expence: But because I liked not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>btain by such Means; but preferred an un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribed Affection.</P>
<P>While this Affair stood thus with me, I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccasion to take another Journey into <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ussex:</HI> Which yet I would not mention here, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut for a particular Accident, which befel me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Way.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"/> would afford us: and with much ado, by Praying hard, and Paying dear, I got a smal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Joint of Meat from the Spit; which served ra¦ther to stay, than satisfie our Stomachs; for w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were all pretty sharp set.</P>
<P>After this short Repast, being weary of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Quarters, we quickly Mounted, and took th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Road again; willing to hasten from a Place, where we found nothing but Rudeness: fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Roysters,</HI> who at that time swarmed there, besides the Damning Oaths they belched out a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one another, looked very sowerly on us, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they grudged us both the Horses we rode, and the Cloaths we wore.</P>
<P>A Knot of these soon followed us, designing (as we afterwards found) to put an Abuse up∣on us, and make themselves Sport with us. We had a spot of fine, smooth, sandy Way, whereon the Horses trod so softly that we heard them not, till one of them was upon us. I was then riding a Breast with <HI>Guli,</HI> and dis∣coursing with her; when on a suddain hearing a little Noise, and turning mine Eye that way, I saw an Horseman coming up on the further Side of her Horse, having his left Arm stretch∣ed out, just ready to take her about the Waste, and pluck her off backwards from her own Horse, to lay her before him upon his. I had but just time to thrust forth my Stick, between him and her, and bid him stand off: and at the same time reigning my Horse, to let hers go before me, thrust in between her and him and being better Mounted than he, my Horse
<PB N="265" REF="273"/>
<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"/> run him off. But his Horse being (tho' weak∣er than mine, yet) Nimble, he slipt by me, and got up to her on the near Side; endeavour∣ing to offer Abuse to her: To prevent which, I thrust in upon him again, and in our Jostling, we drove her Horse quite out of the Way, and almost into the next Hedge.</P>
<P>While we were thus Contending, I heard a Noise of loud Laughter behind us; and turn∣ing my Head that way, I saw three or four Horse-men more, who could scarce sit their Horses for Laughing, to see the Sport their Companion made with us. From thence I saw it was a Plot laid; and that this rude Fel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow was not to be dallied with: Wherefore I bestirr'd my self the more to keep him off; Admonishing him to take Warning in time, and give over his Abusiveness, lest he Re∣pented too late. He had in his Hand a short thick Truncheon, which he held up at me; on which laying hold with a strong Gripe, I suddainly wrenched it out of his Hand, and threw it at as far a Distance behind me, as I could.</P>
<P>While he rode back to fetch his Truncheon, I called up honest <HI>John Gigger;</HI> who was indeed a right honest Man, and of a Temper so throughly Peaceable, that he had not hitherto put in at all. But now I rouzed him, and bid him ride so close up to his Mistress's Horse, on the further Side, that no Horse might thrust in between; and I would endeavour to Guard the near Side. But he, good Man, not thinking it,
<PB N="266" REF="274"/>
<MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"/> perhaps, decent enough for him to Ride so nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Mistress, left room enough for another t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ride between. And indeed, so soon as ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brute had recovered his Truncheon, he cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up directly thither; and had thrust in again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had not I, by a nimble turn, chopt in upon him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and kept him at a Bay.</P>
<P>I then told him, I had hitherto spared him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but wish'd him not to Provoke me further. This I spake with such a Tone, as bespake an high Resentment of the Abuse put upon us and withal pressed so close upon him with my Horse, that I suffered him not to come up any more to <HI>Guli.</HI></P>
<P>This his Companions (who kept an equal distance behind us) both heard and saw; and thereupon Two of them advancing, came up to us. I then thought I might likely have my Hands full; but Providence turn'd it otherwise. For they, seeing the Contest rise so high, and probably fearing it would rise higher, not knowing where it might stop, came in to part us: Which they did, by taking him away; one of them leading his Horse by the Bridle, and the other driving him on with his Whip, and so carried him off.</P>
<P>One of their Campany staid yet behind. And it so happening, that a great Shower just then fell, we betook our selves, for shelter, to a thick and well-spread <HI>Oak,</HI> which stood hard by. Thither also came that other Person (who wore the <HI>Duke</HI>'s Livery) and while we put on our de∣fensive Garments against the Weather, which

<P>He then begg'd hard that we would pass by the Offence, and make no Complaint to their Lord: for he knew, he said, <HI>the</HI> Duke <HI>would be very severe; and it would be the utter Ruin of the Young Man.</HI> When he had said what he could, he went off before us, without any ground given him to expect Favour: And when we had fit∣ted our selves for the Weather, we followed af∣ter, our own Pace.</P>
<P>When we came to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> I set <HI>John Gig∣ger</HI> foremost, bidding him lead on briskly, through the Town; and placing <HI>Guli</HI> in the middle, I came close up after her, that I might both Observe, and Interpose, if any fresh abuse should have been offered her. We were expect∣ed, I perceived: for, though it Rained very hard, the Street was thronged with Men; who

We took each other in a Select Meeting, of the Ancient and Grave <HI>Friends</HI> of that Country, holden in a <HI>Friend</HI>'s House, where, in those times, not only the Monthly Meeting for Business, but the Publick Meeting for Worship was sometimes kept.

Which (though perhaps not wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree from some Tincture of Self-Interest in the Proposer) was not, in it self, the worst of Counsel.

<P>My Travels into those Parts were the more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ksome to me, from the Solitariness I under∣went, and want of suitable Society.

<P>A Copy of the foregoing Lines, inclosed in a Letter of <HI>Condoleance,</HI> I sent by the first Post in∣to <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> to my dear Friends the af∣flicted Parents: And upon my Return home, going to visit them, we sate down and solemnly mixed our Sorrows and Tears together.</P>
<P>About this time (as I remember) it was, that some Bickerings happening between some <HI>Bap∣tists,</HI> and some of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> in or about <HI>High-Wiccomb</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire;</HI> oc∣casioned by some reflecting Words a <HI>Baptist</HI>-Preacher had publickly uttered in one of their Meetings there, against the <HI>Quakers</HI> in general, and <HI>W. Penn</HI> in particular: it came, at length, to this Issue, that a Meeting for a publick Dis∣pute was appointed, to be holden at <HI>West-Wic∣comb,</HI> between <HI>Jeremy Ives</HI> (who espoused his Brother's Cause) and <HI>W. Penn.</HI></P>
<P>To this Meeting, it being so near me, I went; rather to Countenance the Cause, than for any Delight I took in such Work: for indeed, I have rarely found the Advantage, equivolent to the
<PB N="282" REF="290"/>
<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"/> Trouble and Danger, arising from those Contests. For which Cause I would not chuse them, as, be∣ing justly engaged, I would not refuse them.</P>
<P>The Issue of this proved better than I ex∣pected. For <HI>Ives</HI> having undertaken an Ill Cause, to argue against the <HI>Divine Light,</HI> and <HI>Universal Grace, conferr'd by God on all Men;</HI> when he had spent his Stock of Arguments, which he brought with him on that Subject: finding his Work go on heavily, and the Audi∣tory not well satisfied; stept down from his Seat, and departed, with purpose to have bro∣ken up the Assembly. But, except some few of his Party, who followed him, the People ge∣nerally stay'd, and were the more attentive to what was afterwards delivered amongst them. Which <HI>Ives</HI> understanding came in again, and in an angry railing Manner, expressing his Dis∣like that we went not all away when he did, gave more Disgust to the People.</P>
<P>After the Meeting was ended, I sent to my Friend <HI>I. P.</HI> (by his Son and Servant, who re∣turned Home, though it was late, that Even∣ing) a short Account of the Business in the fol∣lowing <HI>Distich.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="283" REF="291"/>
<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"/> But both they and we had quickly other Work found us: It soon became a stormy time. The Clouds had been long gathering, and threat∣ned a Tempest. The Parliament had sate some time before, and hatched that unaccountable Law, which was called <HI>The Conventicle Act:</HI> (If that may be allowed to be called a Law, by whomsoever made) which was so directly con∣trary to the Fundamental Laws of <HI>England,</HI> to common Justice, Equity and right Reason; as this manifestly was. For</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> It brake down and overrun the Bounds and Banks, anciently set for the Defence and Security of <HI>Englishmens</HI> Lives, Liberties and Properties, <HI>viz. Tryal by Juries.</HI> Instead thereof directing and authorizing Justices of the Peace (and that too privately, out of <HI>Sessions</HI>) to Convict, Fine, and by their Warrants Distrein upon Of∣fendors against it; directly contrary to the <HI>Great Charter.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By that Act, the Informers (who Swear for their own Advantage, as being thereby en∣tituled to a Third Part of the Fines) were many times concealed, driving on an underhand pri∣vate Trade: so that Men might be, and often were Convicted and Fined, without having any Notice or Knowledge of it, till the Officers came and took away their Goods, nor even then could they tell by whose Evidence they were convicted. Than which, what could be more opposite to common Justice? which requires that every Man should be openly charged, and have his Accuser Face to Face, that he might
<PB N="284" REF="292"/>
<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"/> both Answer for himself before he be convicted, and object to the Validity of the Evidence gi∣ven against him.</P>
<P N="3">3. By that Act, the Innocent were punished for the Offences of the Guilty. If the Wife or Child was convicted of having been at one of those Assemblies, which by that Act was adjudg∣ed Unlawful; the Fine was levied on the Goods of the Husband or Father of such Wife or Child: though he was neither present at such Assembly, nor was of the same Religious Perswasion that they were of; but perhaps an Enemy to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was left in the arbitrary Pleasure of the Justices to lay half the Fine for the House or Ground where such Assembly was holden, and half the Fine for a pretended unknown Preacher; and the whole Fines of such and so many of the Meeters as they should account Poor, upon any other or others of the People, who were present at the same Meeting (not exceeding a certain limitted Sum;) without any regard to Equity or Reason. And yet (such Blindness doth the <HI>Spirit of Persecution</HI> bring on Men, otherwise sharp sighted enough) that this Unlawful, Un∣just, Unequal, Unreasonable and Unrighteous Law took place in (almost) all Places, and was vigorously prosecuted against the Meetings of <HI>Dissenters</HI> in general; though the Brunt of the Storm fell most sharply on the People called <HI>Quakers:</HI> not that it seemed to be more particu∣larly levelled at them: but that they stood more fair, steady and open, as a But to receive all the
<PB N="285" REF="293"/>
<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"/> Shot that came, while some others found means, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd freedom to retire to Coverts for Shelter.</P>
<P>No sooner had the Bishops obtained this Law, for suppressing all other Meetings but their own, but some of the Clergy of most Ranks, and some others too, who were over-much bigotted to that Party, bestirr'd themselves with might and main, to find out and Encourage the most profligate Wretches to turn Informers; and to get such Persons into Parochial Offices, as would be most obsequious to their Commands, and ready at their Beck, to put it into the most ri∣gorous Execution. Yet it took not alike in all Places; but some were forwarder in the Work than others, according as the Agents intended to be chiefly imployed therein, had been pre∣disposed thereunto.</P>
<P>For in some Parts of the Nation care had been timely taken, by some not of the lowest Rank, to chuse out some particular Persons (Men of sharp Wit, close Countenances, pliant Tempers and deep Dissimulation) and send them forth a∣mong the <HI>Sectaries,</HI> so called; with Instructions to thrust themselves into all Societies, Conform to all, or any sort of Religious Profession, <HI>Pro∣teous</HI>-like change their Shapes, and transform themselves from one Religious Appearance to another, as occasion should require. In a word, To be all things to all: not that they might win some; but that they might (if possible) ruin all, at least many.</P>
<P>The Drift of this Design was, That they who imployed them might, by this means, get a full
<PB N="286" REF="294"/>
<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"/> Account what Number of <HI>Dissenters Meetings</HI> of every sort, there were in each County; and where kept: what Number of Persons frequent¦ed them, and of what Ranks; who amongst them were Persons of Estate, and where they li∣ved: that when they should afterwards have troubled the Waters, they might the better know where, with most Advantage, to cast their Nets</P>
<P>He, of these Emisaries, whose Post was as∣signed him in this County of <HI>Bucks,</HI> adventured to thrust himself upon a <HI>Friend,</HI> under the coun∣terfeit Appearance of a <HI>Quaker:</HI> but being by the Friend suspected, and thereupon dismist un∣entertain'd, he was forced to betake himself to an Inn or Alehouse for Accommodation. Long he had not been there, e're his unruly Nature (not to be long kept under by the Curb of a feigned Sobriety) broke forth into open Pro∣phanness: so true is that of the POET,
<Q><L><HI>Naturam expellas furcâ licèt, us{que} recurret.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>To Fudling now falls he with those whom he found Tippling there before; and who but he amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gst them! In him was then made good the Proverb, <HI>In Vino Veritas:</HI> for in his Cups he out with that, which was, no doubt, to have been kept a Secret. 'Twas to his Pot-Compa∣nions, that (after his Head was somewhat heat∣ed with strong Liquors) he discovered that he was sent forth by Dr. <HI>Mew,</HI> the then Vice-Chan∣cellor of <HI>Oxford,</HI> on the Design before related, and under the Protection of Justice <HI>Morton,</HI> a
<PB N="287" REF="295"/>
<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"/> Warrant under whose Hand and Seal he there produced.</P>
<P>Sensible of his Error too late (when Sleep had restored him to some degree of Sense) and dis∣couraged with this ill Success of his Attempt upon the <HI>Quakers,</HI> he quickly left that Place; and crossing through the Country, cast himself among the <HI>Baptists,</HI> at a Meeting which they held in a private Place: of which the over-easie Credulity of some that went among them (whom he had craftily insinuated himself into) had given him Notice. The Entertainment he found amongst them, deserved a better Return than he made them. For, having smoothly wrought himself into their good Opinion, and cunningly drawn some of them into an unwary Openness, and Freedom of Conversation with him, upon the unpleasing Subject of the Severi∣ty of those Times; he most villanously impeach∣ed one of them (whose Name was <HI>— Head∣ach,</HI> a Man well reputed amongst his Neigh∣bours) of having spoken <HI>Treasonable Words:</HI> and thereby brought the Man in danger of losing both his Estate and Life; had not a seasonable Discovery of his abominable Practices elsewhere (imprinting Terror, the Effect of Guilt upon him) caused him to fly both out of the Court and Country; at that very instant of Time, when the honest Man stood at the Bar, ready to be arraigned upon his false Accusation.</P>
<P>This his false Charge against that <HI>Baptist,</HI> left him no further room to play the Hypocrite in those Parts. Off therefore go his Cloak and
<PB N="288" REF="296"/>
<MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"/> Vizor. And now he openly appears, in his pro¦per Colours, to disturb the Assemblies of God's People: which was indeed the very End, for which the Design at first was laid.</P>
<P>But because the Law provided, <HI>That a Con¦viction must be grounded upon the Oaths of two Witnesses;</HI> it was needful for him, in order to the carrying on his intended Mischief, to find out an Associate, who might be both sordid e∣nough for such an Imployment, and vicious enough to be his Companion.</P>

For he lookin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it over, after <HI>Ayrs</HI> was gone; and taking it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the wrong Handle, entertained an evil Opinio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it, and of me for it, though he knew me no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>

<PB N="329" REF="337"/>
<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"/> Book: For a Libel they could not call it, my Name being to it at length.</P>
<P>Wherefore sending for <HI>Ayrs,</HI> who had brought the Book, Justice <HI>Titchborn</HI> examined him if <HI>he knew me, and where I dwelt.</HI> Who telling him, He <HI>knew me well, and had been often at my House:</HI> He gave him in charge to give me Notice, that <HI>I should appear before him and the other Justice, at</HI> Rickmansworth <HI>on such a Day:</HI> Threatning that <HI>if I did not appear, he himself should be Prosecuted for spreading the Book.</HI></P>
<P>This put <HI>William Ayrs</HI> in a Fright. Over he came in haste with this Message to me; troubled that he should be a means to bring me into Trouble. But I endeavoured to give him Ease, by assuring him I would not fail (with God's Leave) to appear at the time and place appoint∣ed; and thereby free him from <HI>Trouble</HI> or <HI>Danger.</HI></P>
<P>In the Interim I received Advice, by an Ex∣press out of <HI>Sussex,</HI> that <HI>Guli Penn</HI> (with whom I had had an Intimate Acquaintance, and firm Friendship from our very Youths) was very dangerously Ill (her Husband being then absent in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI>) and that she had a great De∣sire to see and speak with me.</P>
<P>This put me to a great Straight, and brought a sore Exercise on my Mind. I was divided betwixt Honour and Friendship. I had engag∣ed my Word to appear before the Justices; which to omit, would bring Dishonour on me and my Profession. To stay till that time was come and past, might probably prove (if I
<PB N="330" REF="338"/>
<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"/> should then be left at Liberty) too late to An∣swer her desire, and satisfie Friendship.</P>
<P>After some little Deliberation, I resolv'd (as the best Expedient to answer both Ends) to go over next Morning to the Justices, and lay my Straight before them; and try if I cou'd procure from them a Respit of my Appearance before them, until I had been in <HI>Sussex,</HI> and paid the Duty of Friendship to my Sick Friend. Which I had the more Hopes to obtain, because I knew those Justices had a great respect for <HI>Guli.</HI> For when <HI>William Penn</HI> and she were first Married, they lived for some Years at <HI>Rickmansworth;</HI> in which time they contracted a <HI>Neighbourly Friend∣ship</HI> with both these Justices and theirs; who ever after retained a kind regard for them both.</P>
<P>Early therefore in the Morning I rode over. But being wholly a Stranger to the Justices, I went first to <HI>Watford,</HI> that I might take <HI>Ayrs</HI> a∣long with me, who supposed himself to have some Interest in <HI>Justice Titchborn:</HI> And when I came there, understanding that another Friend of that Town, whose Name was <HI>John Wells,</HI> was well acquainted with the other Justice, <HI>Fotherly;</HI> having imparted to them the Occasion of my coming, I took them both with me, and hasted back to <HI>Rickmansworth.</HI> Where having put our Horses up at an Inn, and leaving <HI>W. Ayrs</HI> (who was a Stranger to <HI>Fotherly</HI>) there; I went with <HI>John Wells</HI> to <HI>Fotherly</HI>'s House: and being brought into a fair Hall, I tarried there, while <HI>Wells</HI> went into the Parlour to him, and having acquainted him that I was there, and desired
<PB N="331" REF="339"/>
<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"/> to speak w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th him, brought him to me with Severity in his Countenance.</P>
<P>After he had asked me (in a Tone which spake Displeasure) <HI>what I had to say to him?</HI> I told him, I came to wait on him, upon an Intima∣tion given me, that he had something to say to me: He thereupon, plucking my Book out of his Pocket, asked me, <HI>If I owned my self to be the Author of that Book?</HI> I told him If he pleased to let me look into it; if it were mine, I would not deny it. He thereupon giving it into my Hand, when I had turned over the Leaves, and look'd it through, finding it to be as it came from the Press; I told him, I wrote the Book, and would own it, all but the Errors of the Press. Whereupon he, looking sternly on me, answered, <HI>Your own Errors you should have said.</HI></P>
<P>Having Innocency on my side, I was not at all daunted at either his Speech, or Looks: but feeling the Lord present with me, I replied, I know there are Errors of the Press in it, and therefore I excepted them: but I do not know there is any Error of mine in it, and therefore cannot except them. But (added I) if thou pleasest to shew me any Error of mine in it, I shall readily both acknowledge and retract it. And thereupon I desired him to give me an In∣stance, in any one Passage in that Book, wherein he thought I had Erred. He said, <HI>he needed not go to particulars: but charge me with the general Contents of the whole Book.</HI> I replied, that such a Charge would be too General, for me to give a Particular Answer to: but if he would assign
<PB N="332" REF="340"/>
<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"/> me any particular Passage, or Sentence in the Book, wherein he apprehended the ground of Offence to lie; when I should have opened the Terms, and explained my meaning therein, he might perhaps find Cause to change his Mind, and entertain a better Opinion, both of the Book and me. And therefore I again intreated him, to let me know what particular Passage, or Pas∣sages had given him an Offence. He told me, <HI>I needed not to be in so much haste for that; I might have it timely enough, if not too soon: But this,</HI> said he, <HI>is not the Day appointed for your Hearing; and therefore</HI> (added he) <HI>what, I pray, made you in such haste to come now?</HI> I told him, I hoped he wou'd not take it for an Argument of Guilt, that I came before I was sent for: and offered my self to my Purgation, before the time ap∣pointed. And this I spake with somewhat a brisker Air: which had so much Influence on him, as to bring a somewhat softer Air over his Countenance.</P>
<P>Then, going on, I told him, I had a parti∣cular Occasion, which induced me to come now; which was, That I received Advice last Night, by an Express out of <HI>Sussex,</HI> That <HI>William Penn</HI>'s Wife (with whom I had had an intimate Acquaintance, and strict Friend∣ship, <HI>ab ipsis ferè Incunabilis,</HI> at least, <HI>à teneris Unguiculis</HI>) lay now there very ill; not with∣out great Danger (in the Apprehension of those about her) of her Life: and that she had ex∣prest her desire that I would come to her, as soon as I could; the rather, for that her Hus∣band
<PB N="333" REF="341"/>
<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"/> was absent in <HI>America.</HI> That this had brought a great Straight upon me, being divid∣ed between <HI>Friendship</HI> and <HI>Duty;</HI> willing to visit my Friend in her Ilness, which the Nature and Law of Friendship required: yet unwilling to omit my <HI>Duty,</HI> by failing of my Appearance (before him and the other Justice) according to their Command and my Promise; lest I should thereby subject, not my own Reputation only, but the Reputation of my Religious Profession to the Suspicion of Guilt, and Censure of wil∣lingly shunning a Tryal. To prevent which I had chosen to anticipate the Time, and come now; to see if I could give them Satisfaction, in what they had to object against me; and thereupon being dismist, pursue my Journey in∣to <HI>Sussex;</HI> or if by them detained, to submit to Providence; and by an Express to acquaint my Friend therewith, both to free her from an Ex∣pectation of my Coming, and my self from any Imputation of Neglect.</P>
<P>While I thus delivered my self, I observed a sensible Alteration in the Justice; and when I had done speaking, he first said he was <HI>very sorry for Madam</HI> Penn<HI>'s Ilness;</HI> of whose Virtue and Worth he spake very highly (yet not more than was her due:) Then he told me, <HI>That, for her sake, he would do what he could to further my Visit to her, But,</HI> said he, <HI>I am but one; and of my self can do nothing in it: therefore you must go to Sir</HI> Benjamin Titchborn, <HI>and, if he be at home, see if you can prevail with him to meet me, that we may consider of it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="342"/>
<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"/> <HI>But I can assure you,</HI> added he, <HI>the matter which will be laid to your Charge, concerning your Book, is of greater Importance, than you seem to think it. For your Book has been laid before the</HI> KING <HI>and</HI> Council; <HI>and the Earl of</HI> Bridgwater (<HI>who is one of the</HI> Council) <HI>hath thereupon given us Command to Examine you about it, and secure you.</HI></P>
<P>I wish, said I, I could speak with the Earl my self: for I make no Doubt but to acquit my self unto him: And, added I, if thou pleasest to give me thy Letter to him; I will wait upon him, with it, forthwith. For although I know, continued I, that he hath no Favour for any of my Perswasion; yet knowing my self to be whol∣ly innocent in this matter, I can with Confidence appear before him, or even before the KING in Council.</P>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> said he, <HI>I see you are Confident; but for all that, let me tell you, how good soever your Intention was, you timed the publishing of your Book very un∣luckily: for you cannot be ignorant, that there is a very dangerous Plot lately discovered, contrived by the</HI> Dissenters, <HI>against the</HI> Government, <HI>and</HI> His Majesty's <HI>Life.</HI> (This was the <HI>Rie-Plot,</HI> then newly broke forth, and laid upon the <HI>Presbyte∣rians:) And for you,</HI> added he, <HI>to publish a Book, just at that Juncture of time, to discourage the Ma∣gistrates, and other Officers, from putting in Execu∣tion those Laws, which were made to suppress their Meetings; looks, I must tell you, but with a scurvy Countenance upon you.</HI></P>
<P>If (replied I, with somewhat a pleasanter Air) there was any Mis-timing in the Case, it must
<PB N="335" REF="343"/>
<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"/> lie on the Part of those Plotters, for timing the breaking forth of their Plot while my Book was a Printing: for I can bring very good Proof, that my Book was in the Press, and well-nigh wrought off, before any Man talked, or knew of a Plot; but those who were in it.</P>
<P>Here our Discourse ended, and I, taking, for the present, my leave of him, went to my Horse. and, changing my Companion, rode to Justice <HI>Titchborn</HI>'s, having with me <HI>William Ayrs,</HI> who was best acquainted with him, and who had casually brought this Trouble on me.</P>
<P>When he had introduced me to <HI>Titchborn,</HI> I gave him alike Account of the Occasion of my coming at that time, as I had before given to the other Justice. And both he, and his Lady (who was present) exprest much Concern for <HI>Guli Penn</HI>'s Ilness.</P>
<P>I found this Man to be of quite another Tem∣per than Justice <HI>Fotherly:</HI> for this Man was smooth, soft and oily; whereas the other was rather rough, severe and sharp. Yet at the wind∣ing up, I found <HI>Fotherly</HI> my truest Friend.</P>
<P>When I had told Sir <HI>B. Titchborn,</HI> that I came from Justice <HI>Fotherly,</HI> and requested him to give him a Meeting, to consider of my Business; he readily, without any Hesitation, told me he would go with me to <HI>Rickmansworth</HI> (from which his House was distant about a Mile;) and calling for his Horses, mounted immediate∣ly; and to <HI>Rickmansworth</HI> we rode.</P>
<P>After they had been a little while together, I was called in before them; and in the first place
<PB N="336" REF="344"/>
<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"/> they Examined me <HI>what was my Intention an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Design in writing that Book.</HI> I told them the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦troductory Part of it, gave a plain Account o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it <HI>(viz.)</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it was to get Ease from the Pe¦nalties of a <HI>Severe Law;</HI> often Executed wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too great a Severity, by unskilful Officers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who were driven on beyond the Bounds o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Duty, by the impetuous Threats of a sort of Insolent Fellows (as needy as greedy) who, for their own Advantage, sought out Ruin.</Q> To prevent which was the Design, and Drift of that Book; by acquainting such Officers how they might safely demean themselves, in the Execution of their Offices, towards their honest and peaceable Neighbours, without ruining ei∣ther their Neighbours, or themselves, to enrich some of the worst of Men. And that I hum∣bly conceived It was neither Unlawful, nor Un∣reasonable for a Sufferer to do this: so long as it was done in a fair, sober and peaceable Way.</P>
<P>They then put me in Mind of the Plot; told me <HI>It was a troublesome and dangerous Time, and my Book might be Construed to import Sedition, in discouraging the Officers from putting the Laws in Execution, as by Law and by their Oath they were bound.</HI> And in fine brought it to this Issue, That <HI>they were directed to secure me, by a Commitment to Prison, until the Assize, at which I should re∣ceive a further Charge, than they were provided now to give me: but because they were desirous to for∣ward my Visit to Madam</HI> Penn, <HI>they told me they would admit me to Bayl; and therefore if I would enter a Recognizance, with sufficient Sureties, for</HI>

<P>I told them, I could not do it.

<P>I let them know my Straight lay not in the Difficulty of procuring Sureties; for I did sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose my self to have sufficient Acquaintance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Credit in that place, if, on such an Occasion I could be free to use it: but, as I knew my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf to be an innocent Man, I had not Satis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>action in my self, to desire others to be bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or me, nor to enter my self into a Recogni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance; that carrying in it (to my Apprehension) Reflection on my Innocency, and the Repu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation of my Christian Profession.</P>

of the most material Passages of the remaining Part of his Life: and such Memorials of him, and his Works, as came to my Hands: which I shall set down with as much Brevity and Plain∣ness as I can, in Sincerity to him, and the Truth he professed and adorned.

<P>To this Book of <HI>T. E</HI>'s. there was a pretended Answer put forth Two Years after, supposed by

For thus it was, That some of the Priests party, vaunting that this Second Book of the Priests was not answered, I took occasion once at <HI>London,</HI> in the Year 1692, to speak to him a∣bout it; and he told me, <HI>That the Substance of the Priests Arguments, in this Second Book, were answered in his former</HI> (The Foundation of Tythes shaken) <HI>only some New Quotations, which he had brought; and that was what he chiefly designed</HI>
<PB N="347" REF="355"/>
<HI>to deal with the Priest about, to Examine and Clear, by adding some New Ones also: but that he never expected to have the last Word with the Priests a∣bout</HI> Tythes; <HI>which their Interest lay so much in, that they would never be satisfied; but always be Cavilling about, some way or other, how little soever it was to the Purpose: and some other Services tak∣ing him off</HI> (as aforesaid) <HI>he laid it by.</HI> Which I mention to satisfie any who may Question in their Minds, why it was never answered (or at least gone through) and this is the Reason why I resumed this Matter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In handling the Argument of <HI>Tythes</HI> (says he, in a Paper found among his Manuscripts, as an <HI>Introdnction</HI> to his said intended Answer) I write with this Disadvantage, That I en∣counter a numerous Party and Order of Men, with whom <HI>Interest</HI> is far more prevalent than <HI>Truth;</HI> whose <HI>Profit</HI> will not permit them to yield to <HI>Reason;</HI> whose <HI>Advantage</HI> will not suf∣fer them to acknowledge the plainest <HI>Demon∣stration:</HI> their <HI>Gain</HI> as apparently lying in that which I oppose, as <HI>Demetrius</HI>'s, and his Fel∣low-Craftsmen, the <HI>Silversmiths</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> did in that which the Apostle preached against, <HI>Acts</HI> 19. 25, 26. Hence is it that they bend all their Strength, and imploy their utmost Force to maintain this Point, by which they are maintained; and like those <HI>Shrine-makers</HI> of old, they endeavour to carry it by Noise and Clamour, instead of Truth and Reason. Nor do they regard what they say, how false soever; or whom they bespatter, how unde∣servedly

Whereas the great Inducement to him for stirring, was the danger lest his Craft should be set at nought, and he should thereby lose the Gains he made by <HI>Diana's Temple,</HI> ver. 25, 27.

<HEAD>An EPISTLE to FRIENDS.</HEAD>
<P>DEAR Friends, unto whom the gather∣ing Arm of the Lord hath reached, and who have known, in your several Measures, a being gathered thereby into the heavenly Life, and are Witnesses of the preserving Power, by which ye have been kept faithful to the Lord, and regardful of his Honour: Unto you, in an especial manner, is the Salutation of my true and tender Love in the Lord; and for you, as for my self, are the Breathings and fervent De∣sires
<PB N="368" REF="378"/>
<MILESTONE N="1686" UNIT="date"/> of my Soul offered up, in the One Spirit, unto Him, who is your God and mine; that both you and I may be for ever kept in the fresh Sense of his tender Mercies, and great Loving-kindness unto us, that therein our Souls may cleave firmly unto Him, and never de∣part from Him. For Friends, it is a trying Day, a Day of great Difficulty and Danger, wherein the Enemy is at work, and very busie, setting his Snares on every side; and spreading his Temptations on every hand: And some, alas! have entred thereinto, and are caught and held therein, for whom my Soul in secret mourns.</P>
<P>And truly Friends, a great weight hath been upon my Spirit for many Days, and my Mind hath been deeply exercised, in the sence I have of the Enemy's prevailing, by one Bait or o∣ther, to unsettle the Minds of some, whom the Arm of the Lord had reached unto, and in some measure gathered to a resting Place: But not abiding in that pure Light, by which they were at first visited, and to which they were at first turned, the <HI>Understanding</HI> hath been vailed a∣gain; the <HI>Eye,</HI> which was once in some measure opened, hath the God of the World insensibly Blinded again, and Darkness is again come o∣ver, to that degree, that they can now content∣edly take up again, what in the Day of their Convincement, and in the time of their true Tenderness, they cast off as a Burthen too heavy to be born. O my Friends, this hath been the Enemy's Work: therefore it greatly behoves all to watch against him; for it hath been for want
<PB N="369" REF="379"/>
<MILESTONE N="1686" UNIT="date"/> of Watchfulness, that he hath got entrance in∣to any. For when the Mind hath been from off the true Watch, in a secure and careless State, then hath he secretly wrought, and pre∣sented his fair Baits, his Allurements or Entice∣ments by Pleasure or Profit, to catch the unwa∣ry Mind. And hence it hath come to pass that some, who have come out fairly, and begun well, and have seemed in good Earnest to have set their Hands to God's Plow, have looked back, and been weary of the Yoke of Christ, and have either <HI>lusted after the Flesh-pots of Egypt</HI> again, or turned aside into some By-path or crooked way in the Wilderness, and thereby have fallen short of the promised good Land.</P>
<P>But you, my dear Friends, in whom the Word of Life abides, and who abide in the Ver∣tue and Savour thereof, ye know the Wiles of the Enemy, and the Power which subdues him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Rock in which the Preservation and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>afety is.

Therefore to this heavenly Grace let every Mind be turned, and therein stay'd, that thereby all who profess the Truth may be kept in the holy Limits of it; that in their whole Conversation and Course of Life, in Eating, in Drinking, in putting on Ap∣parel, and in whatsoever else we do, or take in hand, that all may be done to the Glory of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 31. that our Moderation in all things may appear unto all Men.</P>

For that Li∣berty which the worldly Spirit leads into, is not indeed the true Liberty, but is a false and feign∣ed Liberty, which leads into true and real Bon∣dage.

<P>For Friends, in the holy Fear of the living God, and in the Openings of the Spring of his pure Life in my Soul, at this time, and from the certain Knowledge, and clear Demonstra∣tion which I have received from him therein; I testifie and declare unto you, That this Spirit, which in this Day hath run out, and hath drawn out some, into Opposition against the Way and Work of the Lord, into Division and Separation from the People of the Lord, and from the holy Assemblies which the Lord hath gathered, and by his powerful Presence hath owned, and daily doth own: This Spirit, I say, is the same with that which hath formerly wrought, in other Appearances, against the Truth in our time; and is the same with that Spirit, that wrought against the Work of the Lord in the Days of the Holy Apostles. This Mystery of Iniquity then wrought, and caused many to turn aside, and to leave the right way of the Lord, and to <HI>forsake the Assemblies of God's People,</HI> Heb. 10. 25. Yea, and to run in∣to <HI>Separation</HI> too, <HI>Jude</HI> 19. Upon whom the ho∣ly Ghost hath set his Brand; that they were <HI>Sensual, having not the Spirit.</HI> And many close and sharp Testimonies did the Lord give forth through his Servants in that Day against this Spirit, and against those that were joined to it,
<PB N="378" REF="388"/>
<MILESTONE N="1686" UNIT="date"/> and acted by it, as may be seen in the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>Yea, Friends, this Spirit that hath led some now to set up their Separate Meetings, is the same that led <HI>Jeroboam</HI> the Son of <HI>Nebat</HI> to set up his separate Altar at <HI>Bethel,</HI> of which you may read 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 12, and 13 Chapters. He was afraid, that if the People should continue to go up to the House of the Lord, to do Sacrifice there, as they had been accustomed to do, and as the Lord had required, they would then for∣sake him, and return to the Lord again. And this Spirit now is afraid, that if they whom he hath seduced, and drawn aside, should still fre∣quent the Assemblies of God's People, and con∣tinue to meet with Friends as before; that hea∣venly Power which is eminently manifest in the Meetings of God's People, might at one time or other reach unto them, touch their Hearts, open the right Eye in them, and give them to see the Mischief and misery he is leading them into. And therefore to prevent this, and to keep his Captives close unto him, he hath con∣trived to set up Separate Meetings, in Opposition to the Meetings of God's Appointment, as <HI>Je∣roboam</HI> set up his Separate Altar, in Opposition to the Altar which God hath commanded to be set up; and to keep the People from going thereto. And so subtilly did this Spirit work then, as well as now, that <HI>Jeroboam</HI> contrived to have his false Worship bear some Resem∣blance to the true; that he might the more easily beguile the People: For he ordained a
<PB N="379" REF="389"/>
<MILESTONE N="1686" UNIT="date"/> <HI>Feast like unto the Feast that was in Judah,</HI> 1 Kings 12. 32. But it was <HI>in the Month which he had devised of his own Heart,</HI> ver. 33. Mark that, there is a Blot upon it: How fair or spe∣cious soever the Worship he set up appeared, or seemed to be, yet it was but the <HI>Devise of his</HI> own <HI>Heart;</HI> it was neither appointed by God, nor accepted of God. For you may read in the 13th Chapter, that the Lord sent a Prophet, a Man of God, out of <HI>Judah</HI> to <HI>Bethel;</HI> and he cryed against the Altar in the Word of the Lord, and prophesied the Destruction thereof by <HI>Josiah;</HI> which was afterwards outwardly ful∣filled, as you may read, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 23. 15, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now <HI>Josiah</HI> signifies, <HI>The Fire,</HI> or <HI>Burning of the Lord.</HI> And, in the holy Dread of the living Eternal God, I declare, The Fire of the Lord is kindled, and kindling against this accursed se∣parating Spirit, and against its Work, and a∣gainst all those that join with it therein. There∣fore all Fear before the Mighty God, and stand still and consider your Ways; and let none re∣sist or reject the Warning of the Lord, lest such be hardned to Destruction. For <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> you may read, stood by his separate Altar, vers. 1. <HI>And when he heard the saying of the Man of God, which he cryed against the Altar in</HI> Bethel, <HI>he put forth his Hand, saying, Lay hold on him.</HI> But <HI>his Hand which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him,</HI> vers. 4. O Friends, consider, How hath Driness and Wi∣thering come upon many a great and stout One in this Day, who have lifted up themselves a∣gainst
<PB N="380" REF="390"/>
<MILESTONE N="1686" UNIT="date"/> the Lord; and have sought, by the <HI>De¦vices of their own Hearts,</HI> to establish themselves in their own Way, against the Way of the Lord; so that the Hand they have put forth in that Work, they could not pull in again. Now mind, I pray you, Friends, and observe the way of the working of this Spirit in that Day. Here was the Enmity, the rough Nature of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> the Spirit of <HI>Persecution,</HI> got up first in <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> to dismay the Man of God: <HI>Lay hold of him,</HI> says he. But when he saw that would not do; then the subtle Serpent, the craf∣ty Fox, the fair Speeches, the smooth Words, the seeming Friendship and shew of Kindness to betray him. <HI>Come home with me,</HI> says he to the Man of God, <HI>and refresh thy self, and I will give thee a Reward,</HI> vers. 7. O Friends, stand in the Fear and Counsel of the Lord, and in the Dominion of his Power, over this wicked Spirit in all its Twistings and Twinings. Let neither the Frowns nor the Fawnings, the Threats nor the Flatteries, the hard Speeches nor the Oyly Words, the Pharisaical Friendship, the dissembling Love, the seeming Kindness, the familiar Carriage, the free Entertainment, the fine Bit, the Offer of Advantages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have any Influence upon you, to draw you, in the least measure, to join or touch with God's Ene∣my; with him that sets up a separate Altar, a separate Meeting, in Opposition to, and to draw or keep from the right Way of the Lord: Mind well the Answer, which the Man of God gave to <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s tempting Invitation. <HI>If</HI>

<P>But Friends, because of the Straightness of this Gate, and the Narrowness of this Way, some that have attempted to walk in it, are grown weary of it, and have sought out ano∣ther way, a way which (<HI>Jeroboam</HI> like) they have devised of their own Hearts; wherein they may have more Room, more Scope, more Company, Ease in the Flesh, Liberty to the Flesh, and all without controul. And this I am satisfied, hath not been the least Motive to the Separation in this Day (as it was the greatest in Days past) tho' some that have been drawn into it, may not perhaps see the Ground upon which it was undertaken. But the Lord hath opened an Eye in many, which sees the Rise and Ground, Entrance and End of this liber∣tine Spirit, and its Work.

Therefore all Friends every where, who have not yet a clear Sight, and a thorow Understand∣ing of the Nature and Work, Design and Drift of this dividing Spirit; wait, I beseech you, in Simplicity of Heart, and Lowliness of Mind, upon the Lord, and keep to the Measure of the Grace you have received from him; and suffer not your Minds to be swayed or byassed by any personal Kindness, natural Affection, Relation, Kindred or Acquaintance; but stand single and

<MILESTONE N="1686" UNIT="date"/> open to the Lord, not joining to, nor any way countenancing that which the Testimony of Truth, in the Arisings of the heavenly Life, and Breakings forth of the divine Power thro' any, goes forth against. So will your present Standing be safe, and you be preserved out of the Snares of this insinuating and treacherous Spirit: And the Lord in his appointed time, as ye abide with him, will open your Understand∣ings further, and give you a clearer Sight of that, which at present you do not fully see; and thereby bring you to that Certainty and Assu∣rance, which (blessed be his Name) he hath brought many unto.</P>
<P>And you, my dear Friends, whose Spirits the Lord hath stirred up, and whose Hearts he hath engaged, in an Holy Zeal, to stand up for his Blessed Name and Truth, and to bear a faith∣ful Testimony against this wicked rending Spirit; go on in the Strength and Power of the Lord, in the Might of the God of <HI>Jacob;</HI> for you are assuredly on the Lord's Side, and the Lord <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the Strength of <HI>Israel,</HI> is on your Side. Therefore, Friends, be encouraged in the Lord, to stand stedfast in your Testimony, not giving way to the Enemy, no not for a Mo∣ment. And take heed, I beseech you in the Love of God, how ye enter into any Treaty of Peace, or Terms of Agreement with this Ungodly Treacherous Spirit, which is out of the Truth, and draws out of the Truth, and Fights against the Truth: For there is no Peace unto it, saith my God. And they who have

So the God of Life fill your Hearts daily more and more with a <HI>Phineas Zeal</HI> for the Honour of his Name; and furnish you abundantly with Wisdom and Counsel, with Boldness and Courage, with Strength and Power, to encounter and over∣come the Enemy: And make every one more watchful against the Spirit of the World, to

<P><PB N="391" REF="401"/>
<MILESTONE N="1693" UNIT="date"/> The Second was (in 1693.) <HI>viz. Deceit discovered, and Malice manifested, in</HI> L.

H.</HI> (that proposing Expedients for Peace, this re∣newing the Difference;) and yet but one Day different in the Dates (this being dated the 3d, the other the 4th of the 4th Month, 1693.) that he could not but admire at it; which therefore he compares, and shews the Difference of, and discovers their Deceit in; and not only in that, but also in Relation to the Difference at <HI>Wiccomb,</HI> which they were not yet easie under, and yet would not confess the Truth; but instead there∣of <HI>J.

R.</HI> going himself to the place where he was Buried at <HI>Holton,</HI> to pick up a Stone at the Father's Grave, to throw at the Son, above seven Years after his Death; enquiring, examining, yea, provoking some to pretend as if <HI>T.

<PB N="392" REF="402"/>
<MILESTONE N="1693" UNIT="date"/> him Kindness, to bring <HI>Thomas</HI> under Obligation of Requital, or upbraid him for Ingratitude if he did not. In all which <HI>J. R</HI>'s Malice was manifest more than any thing else; for as to the Ground he was buried in, <HI>T. E.</HI> confesses, he was not so well acquainted with the Grave-Yard, as to know the Difference of Places in it or whether some Parts of it be more Holy than others; which he thinks, considering their for∣mer Principles, they should not have quarrel'd with him about. However the Place was not of his appointing; for he was prevented of be∣ing at the Burial, by a Message his Father re∣ceived in his Sickness, that his Sister (but which of them he doth not say) lay then Sick in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> near unto Death. After he had waited on his Father until he had finished his Life, and given Direction for his Interrment, he hastened up to his Sister at <HI>London,</HI> thinking he might be more serviceable to the Living than to the Dead, and knew not in what Part of the Ground his Father was buried, till after his Return from <HI>London,</HI> he went thither to defray the Charges of his Sickness and Funeral, as some of them knew: and therefore the more shame to raise such a Story. And as to the other of Unkind∣ness, they could prove nothing, but shew their Envy against him; which we shall have Occasi∣on to take further notice of, e're we have done.</P>
<P>The next and last Book he writ in Relation to this Controversie with the Separates, was, <HI>A fair Examination of a foul Paper, called,</HI> Observa∣tions and Reflections, <HI>&amp;c. lately published by</HI> John

<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Great and manifold have been the Mercies of our God, unto his People, in this his Day, and his Loving Kindnesses are beyond expres∣sing: when we were young and little his fa∣therly Care was over us, he preserved us, and nourished us, and caused us to grow up before him. How did he carry his Lambs in his Bo∣som, when the Beasts of Prey roar'd on every side, seeking to devour! Who can rehearse the many Deliverances he hath wrought for his People, in their Passage from Spiritual <HI>Egypt!</HI> How hath he girded their Loins with Strength, and covered their Heads in the Day of Battle! How hath he subdued their Enemies before them, and put to flight the Armies of Aliens! How hath he fed them with Bread from Hea∣ven, and made them to suck Honey out of the Rock! Yea, he hath caused the Rock to give forth Water abundantly, and hath been to his People as a Brook in the way [and <HI>the Shadow of a mighty Rock in a weary Land.</HI>] So that from a sencible Experience we can say, to his Praise, Our Bread hath been sure, and our Water hath not failed, as we have singly relied on him. Oh! his Goodness is unutterable, and his Faithfulness hath never failed them that have trusted in him: when have we ever been in Prison for his sake, and he hath not visited and comforted us there?

<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'For Friends, ye know we have a restless Adversary to watch against, and to war with; one that sometimes walks about, as a <HI>Roaring Lion,</HI> seeking whom he may devour; and sometimes creeps about, as a <HI>subtil Serpent,</HI> seeking whom he may betray; whom, in each Appearance, it is our Duty and Interest to re∣sist, stedfast in the Faith which overcomes.

<P>This, with much more to the same purpose, which might be cited, I thought meet to men∣tion, of the Mercies of the Lord to his People, and Preservation of them from the Beginning, well worth the Reading. Then recounting the

<MILESTONE N="1694" UNIT="date"/> Wiles and Workings of the Enemy, in drawing some aside from the Simplicity of the Truth, and stirring them up to make Divisions (on one Pretence or other) to disturb the Peace of the Church, and hinder the Work of the Lord in the Earth; as lately in the Separates: so now being disappointed in that, he hath formed a new Design in <HI>G.

(for our Adversaries seldom agree in their Charges.) And so he goes on to examine and compare his Books (published beyond Sea, with those he writ here) as to the Ground of the Dif∣ference and Separation, which he lays at his Door, manifesting his deceitful Pretences, Fala∣cies and Self-Contradictions. Answering his Cavils, and confuting his Calumnies, that none might be deceived by him. Concluding by way of Application and Warning to Friends, to be∣ware of the Enemies Wiles: which I doubt not had a good Effect as to many, in preserving them out of the Enemies Snare, who were in danger of being stagger'd by him.</P>
<P>When our Friend <HI>T. Ellwood</HI> had written this Epistle he went up to <HI>London</HI> with it, and pre∣sented it to the <HI>Second-Days Morning-Meeting,</HI> where such Books and Writings of Friends, as are intended for the Press, use to be read and
<PB N="404" REF="414"/>
<MILESTONE N="1694" UNIT="date"/> consider'd, and read it through in that Meeting, and not one Friend (though the Meeting was pretty full) shewed any Dis-unity therewith; but approved it, and left it to him to publish it. And yet <HI>G. Keith</HI> pretended that it was Printed in great Dis-unity, and against the mind of ma∣ny Friends, as though it was only approved and promoted by a Party, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which I mention, to shew that he stuck at nothing to make good his Part.</P>
<P>Against this Book of <HI>T. E</HI>'s, <HI>G. K.</HI> made a heavy Complaint to Friends to have it called in, as very injurious to him (to his Cause to be sure) Poor Man! who had writ so many Books a∣gainst Friends, after he had writ so many for them, and would not take Friends Advice him∣self; and how then could he expect they should answer him? So that his Complaint and Cla∣mour not prevailing to stifle it, he takes another way, first putting out a Sheet against it, called a <HI>Loving Epistle,</HI> but envious enough: In which he charged <HI>T. E.</HI> with <HI>Fifty Pervertions,</HI> &amp;c. which he said he had noted in his Book; but left his Proofs behind to come after <HI>(The first by Post,</HI> as the Proverb is, <HI>the second by Tom Long the Carrier</HI>) in another Book which he threat∣ned to Publish, if <HI>T. E</HI>'s was not called in and disowned: which not prevailing neither, some Weeks after he sent forth his threatned Book, miscalled <HI>A Seasonable Information,</HI> &amp;c. but ve∣ry unseasonable for himself, as to his Reconcili∣ation with Friends; which he pretended he had rather lay down his natural Life (or have his
<PB N="405" REF="415"/>
<MILESTONE N="1694" UNIT="date"/> Right Hand cut off) than be dis-united (or dis∣jointed) from them. This Book he pretended to be an Answer to <HI>T. E</HI>'s Epistle, and to contain his Proofs (such as they were) of the Charge he had published before. To both these our Friend <HI>T. Ellwood</HI> replied this Year (1694.) In a Book intituled <HI>A further Discovery of that Spi∣rit of Contention and Division, which hath appear∣ed of late in</HI> George Keith, <HI>&amp;c. wherein his Ca∣vils are Answered, his Falshood is laid open, and the Guilt and Blame of the Breach and Separation in</HI> America, <HI>&amp;c. are fixed faster on him: written by way of Epistle</HI> (as the former was) <HI>and recom∣mended as a farther Warning to Friends.</HI> Which begins thus:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Dear Friends, who have received the Truth in the Love of it, and have kept your Habi∣tation therein, unto whom the Truth is ex∣ceeding precious, and who desire the Prospe∣rity thereof above all things; unto you is the Salutation of my endeared Love, in this bles∣sed Truth, in which the Fellowship of the Faithful stands. In this it is I desire to know you, to be known by you, and to have Fellow∣ship with you; earnestly breathing to the God of Truth, the Father of Spirits, that he would be pleased to pour forth more abundant∣ly of his Good Spirit into all our Hearts, and fill us with the blessed Fruits thereof, that there may be no room for the Enemy to enter, to break this Holy Fellowship: But that all, who profess to believe in the Light, may so walk therein, that a clear Sight they may
<PB N="406" REF="416"/>
<MILESTONE N="1694" UNIT="date"/> have thereby, and a true Discerning between things that differ, and may be able to make a right Judgment what is of God, and what is not; that so the design of that Spirit (by whatsoever Instrument it works) which would break or disturb the Churches Peace, and cast Reproach upon the Heritage of God, may be so discovered and laid open, that all may see and shun it. As this is the Exercise and Travel of my Spirit; so it is the Service I have been of late, and am at present engaged in. For Friends, 'tis not many Months since I saluted you with an Epistle, wherein my Spirit was drawn forth <HI>briefly to Commemorate the gracious Dealings of the Lord with his People;</HI> and, as in a general way, to remind you of the many Attempts the Enemy hath made, by Force and Fraud, to hinder the Work of God from going on: so more particularly to warn you <HI>to beware of that Spirit of Contention and Division, which hath appeared of late in</HI> George Keith, <HI>and some few others that join with him, who have made a Separation from Friends in some parts of</HI> Ame∣rica. In writing that Epistle I did not consult Flesh and Blood, neither had I an Eye to my own Ease and Quit, as outwardly (for I had no Reason to expect Rest from so restless a Man, nor fair Treatment from One, who in his late Writings and Personal Debates hath so notoriously let loose his Pen and Tongue, to an <HI>unbridled Liberty</HI> of Railing and Reviling) But I clear'd my Conscience, in discharging my Duty to God, and to his Church, and
<PB N="407" REF="417"/>
<MILESTONE N="1694" UNIT="date"/> therein have that Peace, which all his Abuses cannot disturb.</Q></P>
<P>And so he proceeds to clear himself of the Perversions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which <HI>G. K.</HI> charged him with, and answers all his Cavils against his Book; manifesting his Deceit, Evasions and So∣phistry so effectually, that I do not find that <HI>G. Keith</HI> ever replied to it, being answered home, and having his Belly full, I suppose of the Con∣troversie with <HI>T. Ellwood;</HI> for though our Friend <HI>Thomas</HI> answered several other of <HI>G. Keith</HI>'s Books afterwards (of which hereafter) he ne∣ver replied to any of them: which shews he had enough of it.</P>
<P>At the end of this Book of <HI>G. Keith</HI>'s, <HI>J. Raunce</HI> came forth again, with a new Slander against <HI>T. E.</HI> (all his old ones being bafled) as if his Fa∣ther had not been buried decently; which how∣ever False. <HI>G. K</HI>'s <HI>mean Mind, it seems, could not resist</HI> J. R<HI>'s slight Offer, to take off an Hundred of his Books; but rather glad of any Help to run down his Opponent, if he could with Slander, which he found he could not do with Arguments: but had</HI> G. K. <HI>been a Man of any Worthiness</HI> (says T. E.) <HI>or his Cause defensible, he would not (though an Ad∣versary) have suffer'd</HI> J. R. <HI>to have clapt on his A∣busive Piece at the end of his Book, to throw Dirt at his Opponent. And had</HI> J. R. <HI>been a manly Adver∣sary, he would have scorn'd to have crept in at the Tail of another's Book, to renew his Slander, no way relating to the Subject of the Book,</HI> when <HI>T. E's Fair Examination</HI> had lain a Twelve-Month at his Door unanswered. But to creep behind such
<PB N="408" REF="418"/>
<MILESTONE N="1694" UNIT="date"/> a mickle Man as <HI>G. K.</HI> was taken to be, <HI>J. R.</HI> perhaps might count it no Disgrace, to repeat his Slander; which <HI>T. E.</HI> had answered in his Postscript to the <HI>fair Examination:</HI> and for a final Stroke to it, he produces Certificates from those who were concerned about his Father at the time of his Death and Interrment, that he was decently Buried as usual; which may be seen at the End of this Book, in Reply to <HI>G. K.</HI> And there's an End of all those Lying Stories raised concerning the Dead, to asperse the Li∣ving, to the Shame and Confusion of all the In∣ventors and Fomentors of them, the Man was dead, and in his Grave, and there should have rested without Envy or Detraction; and I am only sorry he seemed to retain his Aversion to his Son for the Truth's sake, which he received in his early Days. To the Honour of which I attribute it, that he was preserved, and carried through and over all Opposition, and lived in Reputation and Renown to his Dying Day.</P>
<P>His next Book is in 1695, intituled <HI>Truth de∣fended, and the Friends thereof cleared from the false Charges, foul Reproaches, and envious Cavils cast upon it and them, by</HI> George Keith <HI>(an A∣postate from them) in two Books by him lately pub∣lished; one called</HI> A true Copy of a Paper deliver∣ed into the Yearly-Meeting, <HI>&amp;c. The other,</HI> The Pretended Yearly-Meeting's nameless Bull of Excommunication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In which last <HI>G.

<PB N="409" REF="419"/>
<MILESTONE N="1695" UNIT="date"/> before, <HI>viz. That he was allowed to sit at the Great Square Table among the Ministers and Com∣missioners</HI> (as he calls them) <HI>that could hold a∣bout it, either fully, or near double, to the Number of Twenty four: whether by Allusion to the Twenty four Seats and Elders, mentioned</HI> Rev. 4? <HI>but doubling the Number he doth not determin;</HI> adding, <HI>I think it suits not their Crying out so much as they were wont against chief Seats in the Synagogues, to erect such a stately Fabrick in their Meeting-House, at that time, little differing from the manner of a Throne, but that it is low upon the Floor, covered with Green Cloth.</HI> All which only serves to shew his own <HI>Pageantry,</HI> and which our Friend <HI>T. Ell∣wood</HI> corrects him for according to his deserts. For the Table will hold few more than Twenty four, or Twenty eight at most, and only necessa∣ry to lay Books and Papers on to Write.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of this Book, our Friend <HI>T. E.</HI> resumes the Controversie from the Begin∣ning, shews the Rise of the Difference, and Proceedings thereupon, in relation to <HI>George Keith,</HI> particularly after his coming into <HI>England</HI> in the beginning of 1694; and how he came to be disowned by the Yearly Meeting in 1695, for his rejecting the Advice of the former, and opposite Carriage thereunto; which being so excellent to the matter in hand, and setting the Controversie in a clear light, I shall here insert it; which begins thus:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It is an old Observation, That none prove more angry and implacable Enemies to any Society of People, than those that, for their
<PB N="410" REF="420"/>
<MILESTONE N="1695" UNIT="date"/> Disorders and unruly Behaviour, have been disowned by the Society they once were of; a certain vindictive Enmity usually getting up in such, and stirring them up to load that So∣ciety, by which they were denied, with all the Reproach and Infamy they can, thereby both gratifying a revengeful Spirit in them∣selves, and thinking also, by recriminating o∣thers, to extenuate at least their own Crimes. That thus it was in the early Times of Chri∣stianity, may be gathered from the Writings of the Apostles, particularly 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 14. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 1 <HI>John</HI> 2. 18, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 3 <HI>John</HI> 9, <HI>&amp;c. Jude</HI> vers. 4. Among those in this Age, whom Satan hath drawn to this degree of Malice and Madness, <HI>George Keith</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> is the latest, but not the least; whether with respect to his Anger, or his Envy. He, having been bred a Scholar, before he came amongst the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and having acquired more of School-Learning than most (it may be, in his own Opinion, than any) of that Peo∣ple have, hath given, in himself, a demonstra∣tive Proof of the Apostle's Proposition (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 1.) <HI>Knowledge puffeth up, where Edifying Cha∣is not joined with it.</HI> For <HI>Humane Knowledge</HI> is apt of it self to lift up Mens Minds, that have, or think they have it, in any degree of Eminency; and makes them think better of themselves, than of others, or than themselves deserve: whereas true Charity useth Know∣ledge to instruct, and thereby builds up; not to puzzle and confound, and thereby destroy
<PB N="411" REF="421"/>
<MILESTONE N="1695" UNIT="date"/> others: but that Charity this Man not having but being vainly puffed up in his Fleshly Mind, from a proud Conceit of his own A∣bilities; and being gotten into <HI>America</HI> (a∣mong a plain People, who better understood the plain and simple Truth, than the nice Distinctions and Subtilties of the Schools) and there advanced to the Office of a School-Master, with a standing Sallary (as I have been informed) of an Hundred and Twenty Pounds by the Year, he soon began, like <HI>Dio∣trephes</HI> of old (3 <HI>John</HI> 9. 10.) to affect <HI>Praeemi∣nence</HI> in the Church; and nothing less would serve his turn, than to rule and over-rule all. And that he might not want Matter to work upon, and some Pretence to begin on, he not only found fault with Friends Ministry and Discipline there; but having, in private Dis∣courses, put some captious and ensnaring Que∣stions to some particular Persons there, whose Simplicity he thought he might most easily betray, he (by wresting their Answers to a wrong Sense) took Advantage to complain a∣gainst them, <HI>for holding,</HI> as he said, <HI>gross and vile Errors;</HI> and with impetuous Heat prose∣cuted his Charge: and not being so fully nor speedily answered, as he expected, by those Friends to whom he complained, who seeing the Innocency of the Accused, and his evil Design in Accusing, could not Countenance him therein, he involved them also in the like Charge of <HI>Cloaking, or Covering gross and vile Errors, Damnable Heresies and Doctrines of De∣vils,</HI>
<PB N="412" REF="422"/>
<MILESTONE N="1695" UNIT="date"/> &amp;c. Nor gave he over, till by continua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Clamours and frequent Disturbances, he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> filled Friends Meetings with Strife and Con¦tention; and at length having leavened a Par¦ty to himself, made an open Division and Se¦paration from Friends, setting up separate Meetings for himself and his Party, in Oppo¦sition to the Meetings of Friends before settled there. And having got the Printer to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Party (and thereby the only Press there at hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Command) he maliciously put the Difference into Print, and thereby spread it not only in those Parts of <HI>America,</HI> but in these of <HI>Europ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> also. These things drew Friends there, afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much Patience and long Forbearance, to dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with him in a Church-way, and to give forth at length a Testimony against him; which proving uneasie to him, he came over from thence to <HI>England,</HI> about the beginning of the the Year 1694, of which some Friends o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> having Notice, came over also; and at the Yearly Meeting of the People cal∣led <HI>Quakers,</HI> holden at <HI>London</HI> in the 4th Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Year, the Matters relating to that Differ∣ence being fully heard and considered, the Sence of that Meeting was, <HI>That the Separa∣tion lay at</HI> G.

<MILESTONE N="1695" UNIT="date"/> <HI>some few in</HI> America; <HI>and retract the bitter Language in them, so far as he was concerned: and sincerely to use his utmost Endeavours with his Friends concerned to remove the Separation,</HI> &amp;c. Which Sence and Advice, being drawn up at large in Writing, was then in that Meeting delivered to him, and soon after Printed by one of his Party, with very envious Reflec∣tions upon it, as may be seen in a small Pam∣phlet, called <HI>A True Account,</HI> &amp;c. to which I refer. But so far was <HI>G. K.</HI> from regarding the Sence, or following the Advice of that Yearly Meeting, that in several printed Books by him soon after published, he rejected it, denying it to be the Sence or Advice of the Yearly Meeting, or that to be the Yearly Meeting that gave it. Which Abuse this last Yearly Meeting (in the 3d Month past) tak∣ing notice of, and upon further dealing with him, finding him, instead of being humbled and sorry for the Evil he had done, more hard∣ned therein, justifying himself both by Word and Writing, and rejecting the Meetings Ad∣vice. That Meeting (after it had heard him patiently, till he of his own accord withdrew) gave forth a Testimony against him: which he hath since Printed, with his Answer there∣unto. As he hath also (in another Pamphlet) a Copy of his Paper which he read in the Meeting; together with a Narrative (of his own making) of the Proceedings of the Meet∣ing with him, and a List of Errors charged by him on some particular Persons. To each
<PB N="414" REF="424"/>
<MILESTONE N="1695" UNIT="date"/> of these I intend to speak, now that I have premised this short Introduction; which I thought needful for the Information of any such Reader as had not before heard the Ris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Difference, nor the Course of Proceed¦ings thereupon.</Q></P>
<P>This I thought fit to insert, being so materia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as to the Ground of the Controversie with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Keith:</HI> after which <HI>T.

<P><MILESTONE N="1696" UNIT="date"/> But now another Occasion offer'd, and that was, one <HI>Gerard Croese</HI> a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> publishing <HI>A general History</HI> (so called) <HI>of the</HI> Quakers; <HI>containing the Lives, Tenets, Sufferings, Tryals, Speeches</HI> and <HI>Letters</HI> (as pretended) <HI>of the most eminent of them;</HI> First in <HI>Latin:</HI> which was Translated, and Printed in <HI>English</HI> in the Year 1696. Wherein, though he had represented some things pretty fairly; yet in others, through Inadvertancy or Ignorance (I hope not wilfully) he had misrepresented us, and our Principles and Practices: whereupon our Friend <HI>T. Ell∣wood,</HI> according to an Advertisement at the End of the said <HI>History</HI> in <HI>English,</HI> that <HI>some Remarks on it would be published,</HI> he writ some Remarks
<PB N="415" REF="425"/>
<MILESTONE N="1696" UNIT="date"/> on it in <HI>Latin</HI> (perhaps before the <HI>English</HI> came out, which would no doubt have been turn'd in∣to <HI>English</HI>) intending, doubtless, to publish 'em; but in the mean time before they were finished, a Book of the same Nature, and to the same purpose, in <HI>Latin,</HI> was published in <HI>Holland</HI> (by way of Remarks or Observations on the said <HI>History</HI>) which seemed again to circumvent him in his intended Remarks on it, so that he laid 'em by, and never finished them; and so the World was deprived of this Piece also.</P>

Sometimes the Civil Powers, under which she hath lived, have been stirred up to proclaim, as it were, open War against her, and to inflict severe and heavy Penalties upon her, for her faithful Ad∣herence

<MILESTONE N="1696" UNIT="date"/> to her Lord and Master, Christ Jesus. When through Faith and Patience, she hath overcome, and the Wrath and Fury of Men hath been asswaged, so that she hath had some respit from those outward Snfferings; Then hath her old Adversary (the common Enemy of Mankind) bestirr'd himself in another way, to raise up <HI>Persecution</HI> against her of a∣nother kind, by instigating some or other (ei∣ther such as were always avowed Enemies to her, or such as for sometime appeared to be of her, but by the sweep of his Tail had been struck off from her) to speak or write against her, falsly to accuse her, and load her with the foulest Reproaches, and most infamous Slan∣ders and Scandals, that by so misrepresenting her, they might hinder others from joining to, or favouring her, and stir up the Civil Magi∣strate again, to persecute her afresh. This hath been the Lot, this the Condition of the Little Flock of Christ in former Ages, as <HI>Ec∣clesiastical Histories</HI> declare. As for the present Age, and with respect to the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> (whom God, by an invisible Arm of Power, hath raised up, and held up, and made a peculiar People to himself) Experi∣ence gives sufficient Proof, the Matter being yet fresh in Memory.

By that time the Dust, which those Books had raised, was laid by our Answers thereun∣to, a fresh Persecution from the Government arose, upon the <HI>Informing Act,</HI> the main weight of which, it is well known, fell upon us; they who before, and afterwards, assaulted us in Print, finding ways then to hide, and save themselves from Suffering. But when that Storm was a little over, out they came again, and in divers Books, written by <HI>Faldo, Hicks,</HI> and others, heaped up many wrong Charges, Defamations, Slanders and false Accusations against us; all which were refuted, and wiped off in our Books, Printed in Answer thereun∣to: Nor have those of other Professions been so forward to attack us since. But now that Liberty of Conscience, in the free Exercise of Religious Worship, is by Authority granted, and thereby outward Sufferings, in a great

So that when he found his Do∣ctrines Compared with what he Accused Friends of, and saw they were the same, or parallel; 'twas to no purpose for him to go to Vindicate or Clear himself of what was so Notorious▪ And therefore procured another, or at least he under∣took it for him, under disguise of the <HI>Snake in the Grass:</HI> And so to slide by the Quotatious out of his Books, that lay in his Way; which would have been a shame for <HI>G.

<PB N="424" REF="434"/>
<MILESTONE N="1696" UNIT="date"/> would have been impossible for him to have Clear'd himself of them. Therefore this Con∣trivance was found out, that another (or per∣haps he in a Mask, under the disguise of another, for Satan, though disrob'd from his Disguise of Light, has many black Robes and dark Disguises to put on) should undertake the Task of Re∣plying (for a Task it seems it was) upon such a Foot, and under such Circumstances, as might give him some colourable Pretence to wave the Contradictions, and wholly to omit them, and with them whatsoever else he found too hard to meddle with.</P>
<P>So that any one might plainly see this was a Contrivance (as our Friend <HI>T. E.</HI> observes) to help <HI>G. K.</HI> out at a dead Lift. To which Book of the <HI>Snake's, T.

<MILESTONE N="1699" UNIT="date"/> Eminency, assume the whole work unto it self, that he ever did before, or might do after∣wards. P. 102. His Righteous Life, with respect to its appearance in that Body, was grieved by Sin, and the weight of the Iniqui∣ty of the whole World, with the concernment of its Eternal Well-being, lay hard upon him; nor was his <HI>Manhood</HI> insencible of it, under the load of this, did he Travel: <HI>He alone trod the Wine-press,</HI> &amp;c.— <HI>Not that we would irreverently Rob the Holy Body of whatsoever acknowledge∣ment is justly due; nor yet separate what God join∣ed,</HI> P. 104.— Chap. 21.

<PB N="439" REF="449"/>
<MILESTONE N="1699" UNIT="date"/> to the Blood of that very Body of Christ; to wit, that it did Propitiate: For however it might draw stupendious Judgments upon the Heads of those who were Authors of that dis∣mal <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and died Impenitent; yet doubt∣less, it thus far turned to very great Account, in that it was a most precious Offering in the sight of the Lord, and drew God's Love the more eminently to Mankind; at least, such as should Believe in his Name. P. 108. Doubt∣less it did greatly Influence, to some singular Tenderness and peculiar Regard unto all such, as should Believe in his Name, among other his weighty Performances: For the sake of that last, and greatest of all his External Acts, the resisting unto Blood, for the Spiritual good of the World, thereby offering up his Life up∣on the Cross, through the Power of the Eter∣nal Spirit that Remission of Sin, God's Bounty to the World, might be Preached in his Name, and in his very Blood too, as that which was the most Ratifying of all his Bodily Sufferings. And indeed, therefore might it seem meet to the Holy Ghost, that Redemption, Propitia∣tion and Remission should be Declared, and held forth in the Blood of Christ, unto all that have a right Faith therein; as saith the Apo∣stle to the <HI>Romans;</HI>— because it implies a firm Belief, that <HI>Christ was come in the Flesh,</HI> and that none could then have him as their <HI>Propiti∣ation</HI> and <HI>Redemption,</HI> who withstood the ac∣knowledgment of, and belief in his <HI>Visible Ap∣pearance.</HI>— P. 110.

<P><MILESTONE N="1703" UNIT="date"/> But now we come to his great Work, of the <HI>History of the Old Testament:</HI> which, at his Lei∣sure, he had in Hand for some Years; and both he and we had this Advantage of his being put by his Work in answering Adversaries; parti∣cularly that of the Snake, and <HI>G.

Gathered out from the other Parts thereof, and digested (as near as well could be) into due Me∣thod, with respect to Order of Time and Place: with some Observations here and there, tending to illustrate some Passages therein.</HI> In his Preface to
<PB N="446" REF="456"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="date"/> which, having mentioned the Praise of History out of <HI>Cicero,</HI> viz. That it is <HI>The Witness of Times, the Light of Truth, the Life of Memory,</HI> &amp;c. which he thinks cannot be so well verefied of any particular History, as of that which, being written by divinely-inspired Penmen, is con∣tained in the Books of the Old and New Te∣stament. Then speaking of the Motive or In∣ducement to the Undertaking, Two things (he says) more especially led him to it: One, That the Divine Providence, the Wisdom, Power, Goodness and Favour of God, in ordering, dis∣posing, providing for, preserving, defending, and wonderfully delivering his Servants and People out of the greatest Straits, Difficulties, Hardships, Dangers and Sufferings, being more directly, and in a continued Series and Course of Actions set before the Readers Eye, he might be thereby the more stirred up, and engaged to admire and magnifie, to love, reverence and fear the Lord, and be the more careful not to offend Him. The other Motive was, That all, the Youth especially, of either Sex, under what soever Religious Denomination they go, might be furnished with such an Entertainment, to spend (at least) their Leisure Hours upon, as might yield them at once both Profit and De∣light. After which he proceeds to speak of the Manner of Performance under Eight Heads: The Substance of which are,</P>
<P N="1">1. That in digesting the following History, he hath not strictly tied himself to the Letter and very Syllables of the Text; but with all

Where he hath left the last <HI>English Translation</HI> of the BIBLE, he hath fol∣lowed for the most part some other <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Latin;</HI> or the Judgment of some eminently Learned <HI>Expositors.</HI> 3. As to the Chronology (especially with respect to the Times of the Judges and Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI>) he found so much Incertainty, and so little Certainty or Agreement amongst Interpreters about it, that he had a Mind to have left it out; but at the Desire of some he added it in the Margin; wherein for the most part he followed <HI>R. Blome's History of the Old and New Testament.</HI> 4. The few Helps (he says) he had, were chiefly from Dr. <HI>Gell's Essay towards an Amendment of the last</HI> English <HI>Translation of the Bible.

The second Part beginning with the Book of <HI>Joshua,</HI> goes through that, and the Book of <HI>Judges,</HI> with the first Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and carries on the History from the Death of <HI>Moses</HI> to the Death of <HI>Saul,</HI> and the Account that was brought to <HI>David</HI> of it. In which are recount∣ed the Transactions of chief Note under all the <HI>Judges</HI> and <HI>Saul,</HI> the first Anointed King of <HI>Israel.</HI> 8. The third Part (by much the largest) goes on with the second Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> thro' the rest of the Canonical Scripture, sets forth the Reigns of the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> throughout the <HI>Jewish Monarchy,</HI> with the most remarkable Acts and Occurrences therein, from <HI>David</HI> to the Return of the last <HI>Babylonish Cap∣tivity,</HI> and Re-building of the Temple, taking in the Prophets, as near as may be, in their se∣veral Times.</P>
<P>Then he gives Account who hath writ on this Subject; particularly a Treatise called <HI>The General View of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> supposed to be the Learned <HI>Broughton</HI>'s; which <HI>T. E.</HI> com∣mends as a useful Discourse in its kind. And of late Years <HI>Chr. Ness</HI> his <HI>History and Mystery of the Old and New Testament,</HI> (in four Volumes) A Book (says he) well fraught with Variety of useful Matter; but (wittily observes) the My∣stery is not only interwoven with the History, but hath also so much overgrowu it, that the Reader who desires to peruse the History by it
<PB N="449" REF="459"/>
<MILESTONE N="1705" UNIT="date"/> self, will be at some Loss in that respect. And that which promises most to answer his End, he says, is, <HI>R. Blome's History of the Old and New Testament.</HI> A Work indeed (says he) not only instructive and delightful, but pompous and magnificent. A Character that may justly be apply'd to his own (except the Word <HI>pompous.</HI>) A Work indeed it is both pleasant and profit∣able; such judicious Observations, and witty (though grave) Turns on Passages and Things, as make it (as well as his other Writings) not only pleasant to read, but profitable to the Rea∣der. A Work that will remain a Monument of his Worth and Ingenuity to Generations to come.</P>
<P>I would only add, That there is a Book of <HI>Sulpitius Severus,</HI> intituled <HI>Sacred History:</HI> but as that is in <HI>Latin,</HI> and far short of this of <HI>T. E</HI>'s; so this cannot interfere with that, or be justly thought to be in Imitation of it.</P>
<P>About this time we entred into a more par∣ticular Correspondence by Letters on several Occasions; which we continued, at times, almost 'till his Death. So that I usually imparted to him the most remarkable Occurrences that pas∣sed here; and often advised with him in the most important Affairs, as I had Occasion: and he, in Requital, was always ready to Answer me, in a very obliging manner, in any thing I desired. And I must acknowledge, he was very helpful to me, by his Advice, in some Contro∣versies I had with some late Adversaries; which I shall not now name, some of them being gone

<P><MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="date"/> The next Year, <HI>viz.</HI> 1706, there followed an Intercourse of some Letters between him and <HI>William Sewell</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> upon some particular Points; which led into a Friendly Correspon∣dence between them, in some other Matters not unpleasant to read. Several of which Letters of <HI>T. E</HI>'s are in his <HI>Decades;</HI> with many others to divers Persons, Friends and others, on vari∣ous Subjects: Which, if ever it should be thought meet to publish them, or any of them, they would, I doubt not, be very instructive, as well as diverting.</P>
<P>His next publick Work was on this Occasion. About this time a Book was published by a Nameless Author, called <HI>A Divine Treatise, written by way of Essay,</HI> (pretending) <HI>to demon∣strate, according to the</HI> Mosaical Philosophy, <HI>Wa∣ter-Baptism, Imposition of Hands, and the Com∣memoration of the Death and Passion of our ever blessed Lord and Saviour under the Species of Bread and Wine,</HI> &amp;c. This Treatise coming ac∣cidentally or providentially to our Friend <HI>Tho∣mas Ellwood</HI>'s Hands (as he says in his Preface) he observed that the Design of the Author therein was, To re-introduce and set up again those <HI>Typical Representations</HI> therein treated of, among those who have been led by the Lord out of the use thereof, into a more spiritual
<PB N="451" REF="463"/>
<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="date"/> Dispensation. And finding his Understanding in some measure Opened, to see the Danger and Mischief of that Undertaking, and his Spi∣rit withal stirred in him against it, he felt a Concern upon his Mind to publish his <HI>Observa∣tions</HI> which he had made thereon, that others might the more clearly see and readily escape the Snare therein laid to entangle them, and draw them into Bondage to outward Ceremo∣nies, and elementary Shadows again. This he did in a Book Printed <MILESTONE N="1707" UNIT="date"/> 1707, intituled, <HI>The glorious Brightness of the Gospel-Day, dispelling the Shadows of the Legal Dispensation, and whatsoever else of Humane Invention hath been super-added thereunto.</HI> And hoped to make it evident, that they are not of the Nature of the Gospel Dis∣pensation; nor have by any Divine Institution a continued Place or Service in the Church of Christ, without taking Notice who or what he was that writ it, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Since the Author of the Treatise, (says <HI>T. E.</HI>) under my Observation, hath thought fit to conceal his Name, I shall not pry behind the Curtain which himself hath thereby drawn before him, or concern my self to enquire either who or what, he is, or has been: but without any regard to that, shall directly apply my self to give a plain Answer to the most material Parts of his Trea∣tise:</Q> which he did to the purpose, in a close and nervous Answer; it being indeed an excel∣lent Treatise, well worth the Perusal of every impartial Reader: To whom therefore I re∣commend it.</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="464"/>
<MILESTONE N="1707" UNIT="date"/> And now I must say something of him under another Consideration as well as Writing. He had writ several Books against Tythes (as be∣fore hinted) to shew the Unsuitableness of them to the Gospel Dispensation (being <HI>Jewish</HI> in their Original, and <HI>Popish</HI> in their Revival) and that the Obligation of paying them was ceased under the Gospel, as to any <HI>Divine Right</HI> from Scrip∣ture. And now it fell to his Lot to suffer also in his turn for his Testimony against the Pay∣ment of them <HI>(For to him it was given, in the be∣half of Christ, not only to believe in him</HI> (and bear witness to his Coming in the Flesh, and offering up himself, to put an End to the Law and Priesthood, Tythes and Offerings) <HI>but also to suffer for his sake</HI>) being prosecuted (with three Friends more, <HI>viz. John Penington, Abraham Butterfield</HI> and <HI>William Catch</HI>) in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> for Tythes, at the Suit of <HI>Joshua Leaper,</HI> Tythe-Farmer of <HI>Amersham</HI> in the County of <HI>Bucks</HI> un∣der <HI>Humphry Drake,</HI> Clerk, Rector and Parson (so called) of the Rectory and Parish-Church of <HI>Agmondesham,</HI> alias, <HI>Amersham,</HI> aforesaid. <HI>Tho∣mas Ellwood</HI> (with the rest) were <HI>Subpoena'd</HI> to appear at <HI>Westminster</HI> in <HI>Trinity-Term,</HI> 1707. which they did by an Attourney to prevent be∣ing in Contempt of the Court, and took a Copy of the Complainants Bill. But for not Answer∣ing, Attachments were issued out in <HI>Michaelmas Term,</HI> to take them up: on which they were taken into Custody in the Eleventh Month, and afterwards an <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> sent down to the Sheriff of <HI>Bucks,</HI> to bring them up to the <HI>Exche∣quer</HI>-Bar
<PB N="453" REF="465"/>
<MILESTONE N="1708" UNIT="date"/> Bar in <HI>Trinity Term,</HI> 1708, on which they came up. And to to prevent the Plantiffs go∣ing on to a Sequestration by default, they put in their Answers; setting forth the Value of the Tythes, according to the best of their Know∣ledge. Yet so vexatious was the Adversary, that he would not be satisfied with their Answer, but got a Commission of Enquiry to Examine Witnesses in the Country, as to the Value of the Tythes; which they did at <HI>Amersham,</HI> in the Tenth Month. The first Witness they ex∣amined, was one <HI>E—. G—.</HI> of the Pa∣rish of <HI>Chesham,</HI> Aged (as they say) Fourty four Years, or thereabouts, who deposed, <HI>That he knew the Complainant and Defendants; and had known the Complainant about Sixty Years</HI> (which was about Sixteen Years before he was born.) Whereby we may Judge of the rest of his Evi∣dence: The Charge of which Commission, and executing it, came to between Thirty and Fourty Pounds, though some of it was abated on taxing the Cost; and yet they proved little, if any thing more than the Defendants had set down in their Answers; yet went on to a hear∣ing on it, and obtain'd a Decree for the Tythes and Cost. For not performing which, Attach∣ments were issued out a-fresh against them, in <HI>Trinity-Term</HI> <MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="date"/> 1709, to the Sheriff of <HI>Hartford∣shire</HI> (<HI>T.E. A.B.</HI> and <HI>W.C.</HI> living in that County) but <HI>J.P.</HI> living in <HI>Bucks,</HI> was drop't, because the Attachments to the Sheriff of <HI>Hart∣fordshire</HI> would not reach him) and then a Pro∣clamation; but the Sheriff living remote, did
<PB N="454" REF="466"/>
<MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="date"/> not endeavour to take them; and the Prosecutor seemed rather to aim at a <HI>Sequestration</HI> on their Goods and Estates, than their Bodies: so that seeing them resolved to go on, the Defendants, to prevent it, offer'd to surrender themselves to the Sheriff; but he return'd them each, <HI>Non est Inventus,</HI> and they got a Commission of <HI>Rebellion</HI> antedated, and moved for a Serjeant at Arms, the same Day, to run them to a Sequestration in all haste, (<HI>Leaper</HI> being Sick and bad, like to die) least he should not live till it was accomplish'd: but being so <HI>illegal,</HI> at least in point of time, for that there ought to be Eight Days, between the <HI>Test</HI> and <HI>Return of the Writ,</HI> in 30 Miles off <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and 14 beyond, on our appearing against it, they could not obtain it till <HI>Hillary Term.</HI> In which time <HI>Leaper</HI> recovered; and one might have hoped that he might have repented: but instead thereof then got a <HI>Sequestration</HI> against them and their Estates, both Real and Per∣sonal, for Tythes of <HI>Thomas Ellwood;</HI> <TABLE>

<P>Now we come to the second Volume of his Great Work, the <HI>History of the New Testament,</HI> which he had had in Hand at times, for the most Part since he finished his former; and when he had finished this, he brought it up to <HI>London</HI> for <HI>Friends</HI> Perusal and Approbation: where it was Read, and afterwards published this Year 1709, in Folio, under the same Title with the former, only as that was of the Old Testament, this was of the New, <HI>viz. Sacred History, or the Historical Part of the Holy Scrip∣tures of the New Testament,</HI> &amp;c. (as in the Title of the former) which as I gave some Account of, so it behoves I should of this. The former Treatise (says he in his Preface) having found a favourable Reception, he was thence encou∣raged to resume his Pen (which at the close of that Volume he had let fall) and proceed to the Methodizing of the Historical Part of the New Testament, in Two Parts. In the first Part whereof the Reader will find an Account of the Conception, Birth, Life, Travels, Doctrines, Discourses, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, Burial, Resurrection and Ascention of our Blessed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST (the Author of the true Christian Religion) plainly, fairly and succinctly given; ushered in with a brief Ac∣count of the Conception, Birth, Manner of Life, Ministry and Death of his Forerunner, <HI>John,</HI> Sirnamed the <HI>Baptist:</HI> And attended (in the Se∣cond
<PB N="457" REF="469"/>
<MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="date"/> Part) with a like Historical Account of the Acts and Travels of the Apostles of our Lord, in the Propagation of his Blessed Gospel, after the Ascention of our blessed Saviour; so far, at least, as the Evangelist <HI>Luke</HI> in the Acts of the Apostles hath recorded, or the Clue or Thread of the Holy Text leads him: beyond which (he says) he was not willing to adven∣ture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In this Undertaking, he says, he aimed at the same End as in the former, <HI>viz.</HI> That all the Youth especially, of either Sex, under whatsoe∣ver religious Denomination they go, might be further furnished, with such an Entertainment, to spend, at least, their Leisure Hours upon, as might yield them at once both Profit and De∣light; and might be thereby drawn off from mis-spending their precious Time upon other, either hurtful, or (at best) unprofitable Sub∣jects. Then he gives Account why he hath, with the Matter of Fact, delivered the Discour∣ses, Speeches, Sermons and Doctrines delivered by our blessed Lord to his Disciples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> viz. That the Nature of the History required it, and that without it the Discourse would have been less profitable and pleasant to the Reader; and by that means less conducive to the End he proposed, which is to allure him to read the Holy Scriptures with Delight, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to the Poet,
<Q><L><HI>He certainly doth hit the white,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who mingleth Profit with Delight.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="458" REF="470"/>
<MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="date"/> After which he gives an Account of his going from Place to Place in the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> to reduce the several Parts and Passages of the History (in the first Part) to their due and Proper Times and Places, which he endeavoured to do, (tho' difficult) as near as he could. But the Second Part (the Acts) being all written by one Hand, the Method (he says) is more regular, and the Course of the History more clear. Yet the Apo∣stolical Epistles, being without Date, are hard∣ly, he conceives, to be reduced with indubitable Certainty to exact Order; which yet he hath endeavour'd to place them right, according to the best of his Understanding. Then owning the Helps he had in Compiling this History, had been chiefly from the <HI>Criticks,</HI> and <HI>Cradock</HI>'s <HI>Harmony of the four Evangelists,</HI> and his <HI>Apostoli∣cal History,</HI> with a few Words of the Perfor∣mance; which if not done as it should (nor as he would) yet as well as he could; And there∣fore, in all Humility, recommending and com∣mitting it to the Divine Disposal, he concludes his Preface.</P>
<P>Next to the Preface is an Introduction, con∣cerning the Pen-men of the New Testament, and in what Language Originally written, and in what Order of Time; particularly of the four Evangelists, <HI>Matthew, Mark, Luke</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> what they were, the time of their Writing, and some particular Circumstances concerning them and their Ends; well worth the Readers Perusal, for the better understanding the History, both of the Evangelists and Apostles. So proceeds to
<PB N="459" REF="471"/>
<MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="date"/> the History; which he deduces from the <HI>Promi∣sed Seed</HI> after the Fall, for Man's Restoration, which the Prophets foretold the Coming of, and which he pleasantly draws out at large in Order of Time, and explains with the like judicious Observations, as in the former, taking in the Epistles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> &amp;c. (in the second Part) in their proper Places (as near as could be) and gives an Account of them, the Occasion why, the manner how, and time when they were written: ending with the Revelations, which he renders as a Revelation unrevealed; with some Brief Notes on it. The whole, as I said of the former, being both pleasant and profita∣ble. Both which will remain a lasting Monu∣ment of him in time to come.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1710" UNIT="date"/> This Year (1710.) our Friend <HI>Oliver Sansom,</HI> formerly of <HI>Faringdon,</HI> since of <HI>Abington</HI> in <HI>Berk∣shire</HI> (who had long War with the Priests about Tythes) dying in the 2d Month, and leaving behind him <HI>An Account of some Remarkable Passa∣ges of his Life,</HI> which he Communicated (in his Life time) to our Friend <HI>T. Ellwood</HI> to peruse, who being always ready to be helpful and ser∣viceable to all, especially his Friends, he Tran∣scribed the same, and fitted it for the Press: which was Printed this Year; to which <HI>T. E.</HI> prefixed a Testimony concerning him, perti∣nent to the Occasion.</P>
<P>There is one Book more of his, which he pub∣lished in his Life-time; which, it seems, he had had by him, for the most part, a long time, and after he had finished his <HI>Sacred History of the New</HI>
<PB N="460" REF="472"/>
<MILESTONE N="1710" UNIT="date"/> <HI>Testament,</HI> he took in hand to finish, and com∣pleated. And that is <HI>The Life of</HI> DAVID <HI>in Verse;</HI> first begun (for his own Diversion, not then thinking of the Press) and carried on, by degrees, to the End of the Third Book, in the Year 1688. (as hinted before in that Year) when the <HI>Prince of Orange</HI> Landing, and the Nation being in Arms; the Noise of <HI>Guns,</HI> and Sounds of <HI>Drums</HI> and <HI>Trumpets</HI> so affrighted, and di∣sturbed his peaceful Muse (as he says in his Pre∣face) that both she, for a while, forsook him, and he thereupon the Work (for above Twenty Years:) save that on a Review, observing how abruptly <HI>David</HI> was brought in, he added the first Chapter (of the first Book) to introduce his Hero from the Beginning of his Story. Where it rested again, without any Prospect of its ever going further, until the last Winter; <MILESTONE N="1711" UNIT="date"/>(1711.) When having (as he says) less Health and more Leisure, than at sometimes before, he took it up for an Entertainment, to make some uneasie Hours pass somewhat less uneasily over. And after he had read it through, considering that if, after his Death, it should be found among his Papers and committed to the Press, it would be but an imperfect Piece; he found an Inclination to carry on the Story to the End of <HI>David</HI>'s Life, (I wish he had done so by his own) And giving a kind Invitation to his gentle Muse to return (which by some short Visits on particular Occa∣sions, in the Interval, had given him some Ground to hope, she had not quite forsook him) he entred again upon the Subject, where he had
<PB N="461" REF="473"/>
<MILESTONE N="1711" UNIT="date"/> left off; and by degrees went through it, till he had brought his <HI>warlike Hero</HI> to his <HI>peaceful Grave.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1712" UNIT="date"/> After it was finished, deliberating, whether to publish it himself, or leave it, as a <HI>Posthume,</HI> to be published by some kind Hand after his Death, for some Reasons; particularly, That if any should <HI>Carp</HI> at it, he might be capable to answer for himself, he thought best to publish it in his Life time; and accordingly brought it up with him, when he came to the <HI>Yearly-Meeting</HI> (1712.) but not having then an Opportunity to have it Read, he came up again with it some time after (which I think was the last time he was at <HI>London</HI>) and after Reading, committed it to the Press this Year, under the Title of <HI>DA∣VIDEIS. The Life of</HI> David <HI>King of</HI> Israel. <HI>A Sacred Poem: in five Books,</HI> in Octavo. Tho', as he observes, <HI>Abraham Cowley</HI> writ a Poem called <HI>Davideis,</HI> he had not read it till after he had finished his; and besides, their different way of Writing, <HI>A. C</HI>'s was but of the Troubles of <HI>David</HI> in his Youth, and that not half finished. And that he had the same Aim in this, as in that of his <HI>Sacred History</HI> aforesaid.

<P>He lived many Years (if not most of his Time, especially after he was Married) at <HI>Hun∣ger-Hill,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Agmondesham,</HI> alias, <HI>Amersham,</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> (though his House stood in <HI>Hartfordshtre,</HI> as aforesaid) where the Monthly Meetings of Men and Women were constantly kept, for that part of the County of <HI>Bucks:</HI> Wherein he was very Serviceable, in Writing, Advising, and Exhorting to keep all things Well, and in good Order, according to Truth, and the Testimony thereof; and had a Peculiar Gift for Government in the Church, and ordering things in Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, and used to come up constantly to the Yearly-Meeting at <HI>London,</HI> and was very Serviceable therein; not only by his Grave Counsel and Advice; but also, in Reading and Writing on occasion, especially in difficult Mat∣ters. He had a singular Talent in Indicting and Composing of things, Epistles and Papers be∣yond many; so that I must needs say, he was an Ornament to the Meeting, and will be much missed therein, and many other ways.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the Writing of the foregoing <HI>Sup∣plement,</HI> I have Understood, that our Friend <HI>Thomas Ellwood,</HI> after he had finished and Published his <HI>Davideis,</HI> signified, <HI>That he had but one thing more that lay upon his Mind, and that was, to add something to his</HI> Journal, <HI>or Ac∣count of his</HI> Life; <HI>which was chiefly to give an Ac∣count of his</HI> Books <HI>and</HI> Writings: Which, as it shews he had not done it, or finished it before, and 'tis to be doubted he did not after (not Li∣ving long after that) and so no more to be ex∣pected (more's the Pity) from his own Hand. So it shews what his design was, as to what he
<PB N="466" REF="478"/>
intended to have added to it; had he Lived to perform it, or had not Death prevented him. So that the foresaid <HI>Supplement</HI> seems (in some sort at least) to Answer his own Intention (though far short, as was said, of what his own Hand could have done) yet so far as it does any way answer his Mind, I am therein Glad that I have done any service to his Memory, or the Truth in that respect; having endeavoured to repre∣sent things according to his own Mind, and to speak of him and things as probably he would have done it he had been Living, and hope the Reader will accept it the better. To whom there∣fore I recommend it; as giving at least, a fair Character of the Books he Writ, and Contro∣versies he Managed, both Published and Un∣published; which I hope will be no Disservice (but Service) to the <HI>Truth,</HI> as it is intended in the Fear of God: To whose Honour, and the Service of his <HI>Truth,</HI> I desire, with great Since∣rity, to Dedicate the remainder of my Days, and Rest,</P>

<HEAD>AN ANSWER To Some OBJECTIONS OF A <HI>Moderate ENQUIRER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Robert Snow,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE received a Paper subscribed by thee, and directed to the Church or People of God called <HI>Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. Which Paper contains some <HI>Objections,</HI> which (thou sayst) thou hast heard spoken against us, and wherein thou desirest to be sa∣tisfied. To which we say, It is no strange Thing to us to be spoken against by the World's Teachers, that being no more than befel the People of God, in the First breaking forth of Christianity in the World, Of whom it was said, <HI>Acts</HI> 28. 22. <HI>As concerning this Sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</HI> But we are willing to endeavour thy Satisfaction, by Answering the <HI>Objections.</HI></P>
<P>The First is, <HI>You own no Day, either the First or Last, as a Sabbath to the Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The Sabbath (which was the seventh or last Day of the Week) was given to the <HI>Jews, Ex.</HI> 16. 29. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4. Not to the <HI>Gentiles, Psal.</HI> 147. 19. 20. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 19. and was to last (as other typical Or∣dinances
<PB N="2" REF="482"/>
were) <HI>untill the time of Reformation, Heb.</HI> 9. 10 <HI>till the Seed should come, Gal.</HI> 3. 19. <HI>which was Christ. ver.</HI> 16. <HI>the Lord of the Sabbath, Mat.</HI> 12. 8. <HI>who, in the Fulness of time, did blot out the Hand writing of Ordi∣nances,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Cross, Col.</HI> 2. 14. From whence the Apostle thus in∣fers, <HI>Let no man therefore judge you</HI> (the Saints and faithful Brethren, <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 2.) <HI>in Meat or in Drink, or in respect of an Holy Day, or of the New Moon or of the Sabbath Days, Col.</HI> 2. 16. which, says he, <HI>are a Shadow of things to come, but the Body is of Christ. ver.</HI> 17. Thus was that <HI>Sabbath,</HI> which was given by God, to his People the <HI>Jews,</HI> ended and taken away by Christ, before the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were called to be his People. And as for the <HI>First Day</HI> of the Week, we do not read in the Holy Scriptures, that it is called the <HI>Sabbath-Day,</HI> or commanded to be kept and observed for a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> as the <HI>Seventh Day</HI> had been. But, on the contrary, we find the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> writing to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who were <HI>Gentiles</HI> (though not without some mixture of believing <HI>Jews</HI> amongst them, as appears, <HI>Acts</HI> 18. 2.) says, <HI>One Man esteems one Day above an∣other</HI> (there was the believing <HI>Jew</HI>) <HI>Another esteem∣eth every Day alike</HI> (there was the believing <HI>Gentile.</HI>) Well, what then? Doth he commend the Former of these, and condemn the latter? No; but he says, <HI>Let every Man be fully perswaded in his own Mind,</HI> Rom. 14. 5. And in the 4<HI>th,</HI> 10<HI>th,</HI> and 13<HI>th</HI> verses disswades them from judging one another about the Observing, or not observing a Day, as well as about the Eating, or not eating of Meats; and seems to lay no more Stress upon the one, than the other. And if the Drift of the Apostle's discourse there be heedfully minded, it will appear that, as he sets him who believed he might eat all Things, with him that esteemed every Day a like; and him that esteemed one Day above another, with him that eat Herbs: So he imputes the Weakness to the Latter, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. and sets himself on
<PB N="3" REF="483"/>
the other side, saying, <HI>We then that are strong ought to bear the Infirmities of the weak,</HI> Chap. 15. 1. And he tells the <HI>Galatians</HI> (which though a <HI>Gentile Church,</HI> had also <HI>Jewish</HI> Believers in it) <HI>I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you Labour in vain,</HI> Gal. 4. 11. Why so? <HI>Ye observe Days, and Months, and Times, and Years,</HI> says he, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. So Jealous was the Apostle, lest any that had been gathered from outward Obser∣vations, and from a shadowy State, should imbon∣dage themselves again in Shadows, and fall short of injoying the Substance, which is the true Gospel <HI>Rest that remains to the People of God,</HI> Heb. 4. 9. Which in the next Verse is described to be, Their <HI>Ceasing from their own Works, as God did from His. Into which Rest we</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>that have believed, do en∣ter,</HI> ver. 3. And in the 11. Verse he presses others to labour to enter into that Rest, Now when the Apostle says, <HI>There remains a Rest,</HI> it plainly implies that the former Rest, the outward Sabbatical Rest did not <HI>remain,</HI> but was passed away and gone. Nor is it reasonable to suppose, that the Rest here men∣tioned, which is said to <HI>Remain to the People of God,</HI> was an outward bodily Resting, from outward bodily Labour, on whatsoever Day; both, as that would be but to change one Type or Figure for an∣other; And, as the entring into this Rest is set forth in the Text, as a Matter of Labour and Difficulty, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. as it is indeed, yet blessed be the Lord, he hath enabled some, that have believed in his Name, and subjected to his Power, to enter into this Rest, in this his Day; and many are pressing after it, as the true abiding Gospel-Rest, which the Legal Sab∣bath was but a Type or Shadow of.</P>
<P>The 2d Objection is, <HI>You deny the Scriptures to be any Rule for Man or Woman to walk by, so as to di∣rect them to the saving of their Souls.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> In this we are misrepresented. We sin∣cerely own, love and regard the Holy Scriptures, be∣lieving
<PB N="4" REF="484"/>
with the Apostle, that <HI>they were given by In∣spiration of God, and are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteous∣ness, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good Works,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16, 17. and that <HI>they are able to make wise unto Salvation, through Faith that is in Christ Jesus, ver.</HI> 15. And great be∣nefit and delight we find in them, reading them in the openings of that Divine Spirit, by which they were given forth. We are so far from denying them to be <HI REND="blackletterType">any</HI> Rule, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that we acknowledge them to contain <HI REND="blackletterType">many</HI> excellent Rules, Precepts, Doctrines and Instructions, directing Man and Woman how to walk, that they may obtain the Salvation of their Souls. Yet we do not say (as some have done) that the Scriptures are the <HI>only</HI> Rule, or the <HI>chief</HI> and <HI>principal</HI> Rule: because we dare not give the Hon∣our and Office of the Holy Spirit unto the Scriptures; For the Scriptures themselves declare, That <HI>it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to guide Believers into all Truth, John.</HI> 16. 13. And indeed, the true Meaning and Benefit of the Scriptures themselves is not at∣tained to in the Reading of them, unless the Spirit that gave them forth do open them, and unseal the Mysteries contained in them. So that the Holy Spi∣rit is greater than the Scriptures, and therefore we cannot but give the chief Place unto him. For he is able to manifest himself unto Man, and to lead Man into the Way of Salvation, either with and by the Scriptures, or without them, as he pleases: But the Scriptures cannot do that without the Operation of the Holy Spirit. Justly therefore do we affirm the Spirit of God, to be the <HI>Chief</HI> Rule, and yet acknow∣ledge the Holy Scriptures to be a true Rule, and pro∣per Instrument in the Hand of the Spirit, to direct Men and Women how they ought to walk, to obtain Salvation to their Souls, as the Spirit of the Lord makes use of the Scriptures to that End.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="485"/>The 3d OBJECTION is, <HI>You deny the Resurrection of this mortal Body, that this Mortal shall not put on Immortality.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> In this also we are misrepresented: We do not deny, but own the Resurrection of the Dead; Believing, with the Apostle, that <HI>This Corruptible shall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal shall put on Immortality,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 54. And indeed, if we did not believe this, we might well say (as he did) <HI>If in this Life only we have Hope in Christ, we were of all Men most miserable,</HI> ver. 19. <HI>And, Why stand we in jeopar∣dy every Hour,</HI> ver. 30. But the Lord knows, and we have openly and sincerely declared, that we believe and own the Resurrection of the Dead, according as the Holy Scriptures testify concerning it; Which say, <HI>Thou sowest not that Body that shall be, but bare Grain</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But God giveth it a Body as it hath pleased him, and to every Seed his own Body,</HI> ver. 37, 38. <HI>It is sown a natural Body; it is raised a Spiritual Body,</HI> ver. 44. the reason of which follows <HI>ver.</HI> 50. namely, <HI>That Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption.</HI> And as we firmly believe this; So we take this to be sufficient, without being so curiously inquisitive as he, who would needs ask, <HI>How are the Dead raised up? and with what Body do they come?</HI> ver. 35. and was called <HI>Fool</HI> for his Pains, <HI>ver.</HI> 36.</P>
<P>The 4th OBJECTION is, <HI>You suffer Women to be your Teachers, that were forbid by the Apostle, for he says, that they should keep silence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> of old had a strong Persuasion (grounded upon some misunderstood Places of Scrip∣ture) that the Salvation of God was confined to them, and belonged not at all to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And this Opinion had prevailed so far upon them, that even those of them that received the Gospel could not easily shake it off. In so much that, after <HI>Peter</HI> had been with <HI>Cornelius</HI> the <HI>Centurion,</HI> and was come
<PB N="6" REF="486"/>
back again to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he was called before the Church for it, <HI>they that were of the Circumcision con∣tending with him,</HI> and <HI>saying, Thou went'st in to Men uncircumcised, and did'st eat with them,</HI> Act. 11. 2, 3. To whom, having related the Occasion and Particulars of that Matter, he concludes his Defence thus, <HI>For as much then as God gave them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Je∣sus Christ, what was I, that I could withstand God?</HI> ver. 17. And in the next verse it follows, <HI>when they heard these Things they held their Peace, and glo∣rified God,</HI> &amp;c. This Answer, which the Apostle gave in that Case, may be suitable (we think) for us to give in this Case, to such as (from some misunder∣stood Places of Scripture) are offended at us for Suf∣fering Women to speak in our Assemblies, <HI>viz.</HI> For as much as God hath given them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what are we that we should withstand God? God, by his Servant <HI>Joel,</HI> in the Time of the Law, had made this Promise, with Relation to the Times of the Gospel, <HI>viz. And it shall come to pass afterwards</HI> (<HI>or in the last Days, as</HI> Peter <HI>repeats it,</HI> Act. 2. 17.) <HI>that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh, and your Sons and your Daughters shall prophecy, your old Men shall dream Dreams, your young Men shall see Visions: And also upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in those Days will I pour out my Spirit,</HI> Joel 2. 28, 29. (And they shall prophecy, adds <HI>Peter,</HI> Act. 2. 18.) Here was no Distinction of Sex made; But this Promise of <HI>pouring out the Spirit,</HI> and of <HI>prophesying</HI> thereby, is extended as expresly and fully to the Daughters as to the Sons, to the Handmaids as to the Servants. And this the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> doth expresly apply to that great <HI>pouring forth of the Spirit upon the Church,</HI> at the Pentecost immediately after Christ's Ascen∣sion, saying, <HI>This is that which was spoken by the Pro∣phet Joel,</HI> Acts 2. 16. Now at that great and emi∣nent
<PB N="7" REF="487"/>
pouring forth of the Spirit it appears the Wo∣men were not excluded: For when, after the Ascen∣tion, the Apostles and Disciples were returned from Mount <HI>Oliver</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> it is said, <HI>These all con∣tinued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication with the Women, and Mary the Mother of Jesus,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 14. <HI>The Number of the Names together being a∣bout an Hundred and Twenty,</HI> ver. 15. <HI>And when the Day of Pentecost was fully come, they were <HI REND="blackletterType">all</HI> with one accord in one Place,</HI> Chap. 2. 1. And in Ver. 3. it is said, <HI>The cloven Tongues sate upon <HI REND="blackletterType">each</HI> of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them ut∣terance,</HI> ver. 4. Here was no Distinction made, no shutting out the Women; but all were together, all received the Gift of the Spirit, and began to <HI>speake with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them ut∣terance.</HI> Nor was it thus only at that time, and up∣on that extraordinary Occasion, but continued in the Church afterwards. For we read <HI>that Philip the Evangelist had four Daughters that did prophesie,</HI> Acts 21. 8, 9. <HI>Phebe,</HI> a Woman, is recommended by the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to the Church at <HI>Rome,</HI> not only as a <HI>Sister,</HI> but as a <HI>Servant of the Church,</HI> Rom. 16. 1. <HI>Priscilla,</HI> a Woman, is called by the same Apostle, <HI>My Helper</HI> (or Fellow Labourer) <HI>in Christ Jesus,</HI> ver. 3. <HI>Tryphena</HI> and <HI>Tryphosa,</HI> two Godly Women, are saluted by him as <HI>Labourers in the Lord.</HI> And of the beloved <HI>Persis,</HI> another holy Woman, he testi∣fies, that <HI>she laboured much in the Lord,</HI> ver. 12. The same Apostle, in his Epistle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> says, <HI>I entreat thee also, true Yoke Fellow, help those Women which laboured with me in the Gospel,</HI> Phil. 4. 3. Which is the Phrase by which the Apostle doth frequently express his own Ministry; and which he particu∣larly applies to <HI>Timotheus,</HI> whom he calls <HI>Our Bro∣ther and Minister of God, and our Fellow Labourer in the Gospel of Christ,</HI> 1 Thes. 3. 2. Which is a clear Evi∣dence

that those Women, that had received the Gift of Prophesy, did minister therein to the Edification of the Church, as well as the Men. Nay the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> in that very Epistle, wherein he is thought by some to discountenance <HI>Womens Preaching,</HI> doth give Directions for the Manner of their <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Pro∣phesying,</HI> viz. <HI>That they should do it with their Heads covered.</HI> For having first said, <HI>Every Man praying or prophesying, having his Head covered, dishonoureth his Head,</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 4. He adds, <HI>But every Woman that Prayeth or Prophesyeth with her Head uncovered dis∣honoureth her Head,</HI> ver. 5. This puts it out of doubt, that Womens <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Prophesying</HI> in the Church, was at that Time both lawful and usual, as well as Mens.</P>
<P>Now, that by <HI>Prophesying</HI> here is meant <HI>Preaching</HI> (not barely foretelling Things to come) may not only be inferred from the use of the same Word in the verse foregoing, where, being spoken of Men, it is granted on all Hands to intend <HI>Preaching</HI> (and from thence the general practice of <HI>Mens Preaching uncovered</HI> is defended) but may also fairly be con∣cluded, from the explanation the Apostle gives of it, in Chap. 14. ver. 31. where he tells that Church in general, <HI>We may all Prophesy one by one that <HI REND="blackletterType">all</HI> may <HI REND="blackletterType">learn</HI></HI>; Which manifests that by <HI>Prophesying</HI> he in∣tended <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Teaching,</HI> that being the proper way or means of <HI>Learning.</HI> And in the Beginning of that Chapter, where he prefers <HI>Prophesying</HI> before <HI>Speaking whith Tongues,</HI> ver. 1. and 5. he says, <HI>He that Prophesyeth, Speaketh unto Men, to Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort,</HI> ver. 3. And, <HI>He that Pro∣phesyeth, Edifieth the Church,</HI> ver. 4. which plainly shew that by <HI>Prophesying</HI> he meant <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Teaching,</HI> that being the proper means or way of E∣difying. And therefore, seeing he not only allowed Women to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> but directed and advised them how they should perform it, <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. 5. and that in
<PB N="9" REF="489"/>
this Place <HI>Prophesying</HI> and <HI>Preaching</HI> appear to be one and the same Thing, it is unreasonable to suppose he denied them the Liberty of <HI>Preaching,</HI> being gifted and called thereunto. As for those Words of his, 1 Cor. 14. 34. <HI>Let your Women keep silence in the Churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but to be under Obedience, as also saith the Law.</HI> Ob∣serve first, that those Words, [<HI>as also saith the Law</HI>] relate only to the Womens being under <HI>Obedience,</HI> not to their keeping <HI>silence</HI> in the Church: For that was never enjoyned them in the Law, but they were permitted to speak in the Congregation; And both <HI>Miriam,</HI> who was a Prophetess, did sing the Tri∣umphs of the Lord, in the publick Congregation, <HI>Ex.</HI> 15. 20. 21. And <HI>Deborah,</HI> who was a Prophetess, did recount the noble Acts of the Lord, and cele∣brate his Praises in a Triumphant Song, <HI>Judges</HI> 5. Read also what <HI>Hanna</HI> spake in the House of the Lord in <HI>Shiloh,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. And <HI>Anna,</HI> who was a Pro∣phetess, did not only give thanks unto the Lord, but spake of Christ to all them that looked for Redem∣ption in <HI>Jerusalem, Luke</HI> 2. 38. This was direct <HI>Preaching,</HI> and that <HI>in the Temple.</HI> So that the Wo∣men were not enjoyned <HI>silence</HI> under the Law, but were permitted to <HI>Speak.</HI> In the next Place, con∣sider what Speaking it was that was forbidden by the Apostle in that Place, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 34. which from his following Words will appear to be, not a Speak∣ing of the Words of Life and Salvation, not a Speak∣ing as the Spirit of God gives utterance; but speak∣ing disorderly, asking Questions unseasonably, and out of place; not speaking for the Edification of Others, but speaking for their own Information on∣ly: for he immediatly adds, <HI>If they will learn any Thing, let them ask their Husbands at home,</HI> ver. 35. These Words [<HI REND="blackletterType">learn</HI> and <HI REND="blackletterType">ask</HI>] plainly shew, that the Speaking here condemned was not a Speaking the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the Gospel for the Edification of the
<PB N="10" REF="490"/>
Church, but <HI>asking Questions</HI> for their own Satis∣faction, which they might have done at home, but not there: therefore he adds, <HI>For it is a Shame for Women to speak in the Church.</HI> And so indeed it was in such a disorderly manner as they spake, to inter∣rogate or Catechise either the Minister, or their Husbands, openly in the Church, to ask the Meaning of this, or call for an Explanation of that, which might look like a throwing off their Obedience to their Husbands, and must needs occasion Disorders and Confusion in the Assembly; which we may per∣ceive was the thing that troubled the Apostle, and which he laboured to reform: for he said before, <HI>God is not the Author of Confusion, but of Peace,</HI> ver. 33. and he concludes the Chapter with this Admonition <HI>Let all things be done decently and in order:</HI> So that it was the disorderly Practice of some Women in that Church which he reproves, who, it seems, when any Thing was spoken which they did not understand, would interpose, and <HI>ask Questions</HI> for Information sake, which was uncomely in them, offensive and troublesome to the Congregation. This sort of <HI>Speak∣ing</HI> was not permitted them, but was a Shame to them, and from which they ought to have kept silence <HI>in the Church,</HI> and <HI>if they will learn any thing,</HI> says he, <HI>let them ask their Husbands at home.</HI> Of like import are those other Words of the same Apostle to <HI>Timo∣thy,</HI> and probably on the same Occasion. <HI>Let the Wo∣man,</HI> says he, <HI>learn in silence with all Subjection. But I suffer not a Woman to teach, nor to usurp Authority over the Man, but to be in silence,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 11, 12. For hence it appears still, that the Occasion they took of speaking, was under pretence of <HI REND="blackletterType">learning,</HI> wherein they took an undue Liberty to <HI>ask Questions,</HI> as if they would catechize or teach their Husbands. But though the Apostle would not suffer such sort of Speaking in the Church, as might give Occasion to any to think that the Women did cast off the Obe∣dience
<PB N="11" REF="491"/>
they owed, and did usurp Authority over their Husbands; nor after such a Manner, as might breed Confusion in the Congregation, for he was so watchful against that, that he enjoins the Man to be silent in that Case, as well as the Woman. <HI>If any Man,</HI> says he, <HI>speaks in an unknown Tongue,— let one interpret: But if there be no Interpreter, let him keep silence in the Church,</HI> 1 Cor. 14. 27, 28. Yet we have before shewed, that he allowed of <HI>Women Prophesy∣ing,</HI> and that by <HI>Prophesying</HI> he meant <HI>Preaching.</HI> We have also given many Instances of Women that laboured in the Work of the Gospel in that Day; and could, from a living and sure Experience, multi∣ply instances of many Women in this Day, whom the Lord hath committed the Word of Life and Re∣conciliation unto, and who, in the quickning Power and Virtue thereof, have sounded forth the same, to the awakening of many that were asleep in Sin, and turning of many <HI>from darkness to Light,</HI> and from the <HI>Power of Satan to God,</HI> who are now become living Seals of their Ministry. Neither would this seem so strange as it doth to some, did they duly consider. That <HI>God is no Respecter of Persons.</HI> But that, as, in the <HI>old Creation,</HI> Male and Female were Created in the Image of God: So, in the <HI>new Creation,</HI> Male and Female are all one in Christ Jesus, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 28. But, as they that contended with <HI>Peter,</HI> for conversing with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> when they had heard his Defence, held their Peace, and glorified God, saying, <HI>Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto Life, Acts</HI> 11. 18. So, we hope, they that have taken Offence at us, for suffering Women to speak in the Church, when they shall have duly and impartially weighed what is herein offered for their Satisfaction, will hold their Peace (as to any Opposition thereunto) and Glorifie God, saying, <HI>Then hath God committed unto Women also the Word of Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="492"/>The fifth Objection is, <HI>You are a People that have gained Health to your Immortal Souls, and are sure of Heaven, when the Scriptures say, that</HI> the Righteous Man falls seven times a Day; <HI>and the Apostle</HI> Paul <HI>said that</HI> Sin was still actually in him.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> We do not desire to boast of any Attain∣ments. Yet we cannot but confess, to the Glory of God, and the Praise of his Holy Name, that His saving Health hath appeared in this his Day, and we (through his Mercy) have tasted of it. Christ the Saviour, is manifested in Spirit, and we (through Grace) have felt the healing Virtue of his Divine Life and Power. Through the tender Mercy of our God, the Day-spring from on high hath visited us, and hath given Light to us that sate in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death, and hath guided our Feet into the way of Peace, and hath helped us to make our Calling and Election sure. As for the Scripture thou mentionest, we do not find that the Scripture saith, <HI>The Righteous Man falls seven times a Day;</HI> but in <HI>Prov.</HI> 24. 16. we find it thus written, <HI>For a Just Man falleth seven times, and riseth up a∣gain; but the Wicked shall fall into Mischief.</HI> And as the Verse before shews the Occasion of these Words, where it is said, <HI>Lay not wait, O wicked Man, against the Dwelling of the Righteous: spoil not his resting place.</HI> So the latter Part of this 16th Verse [<HI>but the wicked shall fall into Mischief</HI>] implies, that the just Man doth not fall, as the wicked Man does, <HI>into Mischief.</HI> And seeing all Sin is Mischief, it seems as if the Fall here spoken of the just Man, were not a <HI>falling into Sin,</HI> but into some outward Calamity or Exercise. However the Place speaks nothing of <HI>daily</HI> or <HI>continual falling.</HI> Nor do we remember that <HI>Paul</HI> doth use that very Expression concerning him∣self, <HI>viz. That Sin was still actually in him;</HI> though we know that he doth, in divers places, run through, as it were, and open the various States and Travels
<PB N="13" REF="493"/>
of the Soul; in some of which he cried out, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver,</HI> &amp;c! But he rested not there, but quickly breaks forth into a Rejoycing, and cries out, <HI>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord,</HI> Rom. 7. 24, 25. And then in the next Chapter, having said, <HI>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit,</HI> he says expresly con∣cerning himself. <HI>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death,</HI> ver. 2. And again, <HI>Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 57. This <HI>Victory</HI> we press after; this <HI>Freedom from the Law of Sin and Death,</HI> we la∣bour and travel to attain unto, by a Subjection (through Divine Assistance) to the <HI>Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>The 6th Objection is, <HI>Why your Teachers perswade you, that all other People are in a barren and desolate Condition, and are out of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> Our Teachers do not perswade us so; nor do we Judge so of all other People: For we our selves were gathered out of various Professions, States and Conditions; and some of us, who had been seeking after the Lord in other Professions, can remember, that before we were thus gathered to this divine Principle of <HI>Light,</HI> which the Lord hath set up, in this his Day, as an Ensign for the Na∣tions to be gathered unto, and to walk in: we were not wholly barren and desolate; but had, at Seasons, some touches and tastes of the Vertue of that hidden Life, which we were then Strangers to; the Lord having regard to the Sincerity of our Hearts, and answering, in some measure, the Breathings of our Souls to him; so far, at least, as to cherish and keep alive those good Desires which were begotten in us, and to beget in us a greater Hunger and Thirst after him. And it is not hard to us to believe, that
<PB N="14" REF="494"/>
so it may be with others at this Day, who have an Integrity to the Lord, though not acquainted with his Outgoings, and Manifestations of himself in this Dispensation of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Life:</HI> And both our Prayers to God the Father, in and through his Son Jesus Christ, and our Labour and Endeavours, in the Openings of his Love and Life in our Hearts, are, That all these, in whatsoever Profession, may be drawn off from all the dry Hills and barren Mountains, and gathered into the true Sheepfold. For we remember our Saviour said, <HI>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my Voice; and there shall be one Fold, and one Shepherd,</HI> Joh. 10. 16. The Lord grant, that none of these may mistake his Voice, or disobey it.</P>
<P>The last Objection is, <HI>You deny all outward Ordi∣nances, as</HI> Baptism, <HI>and the</HI> Six Principles, <HI>that were taught to the first primitive Christians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The Dispensation of the Law was <HI>out∣ward,</HI> and the Ordinances appertaining to that Dis∣pensation were <HI>outward</HI> also: But the Dispensation of the Gospel is spiritual and <HI>inward,</HI> and the Or∣dinances appertaining to this Dispensation are of a spiritual Nature. The <HI>Baptism with Water</HI> was <HI>John</HI>'s, and came up under the Dispensation of the Law, nor did properly belong to the Gospel Dis∣pensation, though for a time, by Condescention, continued; as Circumcision, and some other Legal Rites, were. And this was that Baptism which <HI>Paul</HI> says Christ sent him not to baptize with, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 17. But the <HI>Baptism of Christ,</HI> the true Gospel-Baptism, that by which the true Believer is bap∣tized into Jesus Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 3. and buried with him into Death, ver. 4. <HI>The one Baptism,</HI> Eph. 4. 5. is the <HI>Baptism with the Holy Ghost and with Fire,</HI> and is plainly distinguished from the Baptism with Wa∣ter, both by <HI>John,</HI> to whom the Water-Baptism
<PB N="15" REF="495"/>
belonged, and by Christ, to whom the Spirit-Bap∣tism belonged. For <HI>John</HI> said, <HI>I indeed baptize you with water unto Repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose Shoos I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with Fire,</HI> Mat. 3. 11. And Christ, as <HI>Luke</HI> records a little before his Ascension, said, <HI>John truly bap∣tized with Water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many Days hence,</HI> Acts 1. 5. which was the Promise of the Father, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. delivered by Christ to his Apostles and Disciples, just before his parting from them, <HI>Luke</HI> 24. 49. Let it therefore be fairly considered, 1. That the Dispensation of the Gospel is <HI>Spiritual,</HI> and therefore the Ordinances belonging to it should be so too. 2. That in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. (From which place the Commission for Water-Baptism is usually fetched) there is no Mention ef Water. 3. That Baptism with Water is no where in Scripture called Christ's Baptism. 4. That Bap∣tism with Water is frequently called <HI>John's Baptism.</HI> 5. That the Baptism with the Holy Ghost is called <HI>Christ's Baptism.</HI> 6. That the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> acknow∣ledges but <HI>One Baptism,</HI> Eph. 4. 5. which cannot be supposed to be that with <HI>Water,</HI> since then he must exclude the Baptism of the <HI>Spirit.</HI> 7. That the A∣postle <HI>Peter,</HI> speaking of the Baptism that saves, says expresly, <HI>It is not the putting away the Filth of the Flesh,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 21. (which it is the Property of Water to do) as if he had said, <HI>The Baptism which now saves us is not Water-Baptism.</HI> 8. That Bap∣tism with Water is no where expresly commanded in Scripture, as it would doubtless have been, had it been intended by Christ for a Gospel Ordinance. 9. That tho' it was sometimes used after Christ's Ascension, yet that cannot authorize the use of it now, any more than of Circumcision, and other Legal Ordinances, which, in Condescention to the Weakness of Believers in that Day, were also used
<PB N="16" REF="496"/>
after Christ's Ascension, yet are confest by all not to be in force now. For <HI>John,</HI> as himself said, was to <HI>decrease,</HI> Joh. 3. 30. which related to his Ministry or Dispensation, not to his Person. Now a <HI REND="blackletterType">De∣creasing</HI> implies a growing less, or wearing away by degrees, not all on a suddain; or at once; and therefore no wonder, if his Water-Baptism was continued for a time, even after Christ's Baptism of the Holy Spirit took place. But as Christ's Baptism was to <HI>increase,</HI> so <HI>John</HI>'s was to <HI>decrease,</HI> till Christ's came to be <HI>all in all,</HI> and <HI>John</HI>'s Water Bap∣tism wholly to give place. Let these things, we say, be duly weighed, and we hope we shall not be blamed, for leaving the Baptism of <HI>John,</HI> and cleaving to the Baptism of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Six Principles</HI> thou mentionest, seeing thou hast not declared what they are, it cannot be expected we should speak to them at this time. But we recommend to thee that holy divine Principle of <HI REND="blackletterType">Light</HI> wherewith Christ <HI>lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</HI> Joh. 1. 9. <HI>In which Light the Nations of them that are saved shall walk,</HI> Rev. 21. 24. And we heartily desire thou mayst walk therein.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF TYTHES In GENERAL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>THE only Command from God, that we read of in Holy Scripture, for the Payment of Tythes, was given by <HI>Moses,</HI> to the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> in the time of the <HI>Levitical Law.</HI> Then God first reserved to himself the Tythe of the Land of Ca∣naan, <HI>Lev.</HI> 27. 30. Which he did for this reason, that, intending to take the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> more peculiarly into his Service (as he did, <HI>Numb.</HI> 3. 6. in stead of, or in exchange for all the First born of <HI>Israel,</HI> ver. 12. 13. and 45. and Chap. 8. ver. 18. Having before re∣served and appropriated the First born to himself, <HI>Ex.</HI> 13. 2.) he might bestow those Tythes on the <HI>Levites,</HI> for and towards the Maintenance of that whole Tribe, as a Reward for their Service in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, <HI>Numb.</HI> 18. 21, 31. and in lieu of, and Compensation for, their Part or Share of and in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which thereupon they were expresly cut off from, ver. 20, 23, 24.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now although it was grounded on a Principle of Moral Justice and Equity, that the <HI>Levites,</HI> thus engaged in a continual Attendance on a publick Ser∣vice, and shut out from their Share in the Inheritance of the promised Land, should receive a sufficient
<PB N="18" REF="498"/>
Maintenance from them for whom they performed that Service, and who enjoyed their Part of the Land: Yet the ascertaining of the <HI>Quot a</HI> of that Maintenance to the exact Proportion of a <HI>Tenth Part</HI> of the Increase of the Land, was not grounded on moral Justice, but had its Dependence on the Ceremonial Law, adapted and limited to the Polity of that Dispensation and People only. And that it might not be extended be∣yond its appointed Time and Bounds, it pleased the Divine Wisdom, to subject it to such Ceremonial Cir∣cumstances, as plainly rank it amongst those carnal Ordinances (Rites or Ceremonies) which were impos∣ed but <HI>till the Time of Reformation,</HI> spoken of <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 10. For as God appointed the <HI>Levites</HI> to be offered for a <HI>Wave-Offering,</HI> by <HI>Moses,</HI> in the Name and on the Behalf of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> when he said to <HI>Moses, Thou shalt bring the Levites to the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou shalt gather the whole Assembly of the Children of Israel together; And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the Children of Israel shall put their Hands upon the Levites: And Aaron shall offer</HI> (in the Margin <HI>Wave</HI>) <HI>the Levites before the Lord, for an Offering</HI> (in the Margin <HI>Wave-Offering</HI>) <HI>of the Children of Israel; that they may execute the Service of the Lord,</HI> Numb. 8, 9, 10, 11. So the Tythes, which were assigned for the Maintenance of the <HI>Le∣vites,</HI> were to be first offered, by the People, as an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> unto the Lord. (<HI>The Tythes of the Chil∣dren of Israel, which they offer as an Heave-Offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Numb.</HI> 18. 24.) And even the Tythe of those Tythes, which the <HI>Levites</HI> were to yield unto the <HI>Priests,</HI> were to be offered, by the <HI>Levites,</HI> as an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> to the Lord, before the <HI>Priests</HI> might have them. <HI>Thus speak unto the Levites</HI> (said God to <HI>Moses</HI>) <HI>and say unto them, When ye take of the Children of Israel the Tythe which I have given you from them for your Inheritance; Then ye shall offer up an Heave Offering of it for the Lord, even</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="499"/>
<HI>a Tenth Part of the Tythe. And this your Heave-Offer∣ing shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the Corn of the threshing Floor,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Thus ye also shall offer an Heave-Offering unto the Lord, of all your Tythes, which ye receive of the Children of Israel: And ye shall give there of the Lord's Heave-Offering to Aaron the Priest,</HI> ver. 26, 27, 28. This makes it evident, beyond doubt∣ing, that the Tythes, which were given by the People to the <HI>Levites,</HI> and by the <HI>Levites</HI> to the <HI>Priests,</HI> un∣der the Law, had their Dependence on the Ceremo∣nial Law, as that Priesthood had; And were to stand no longer than that Law and that Priesthood stood: Which was but till <HI>Shiloh</HI> came, and by the Offering of himself once for all, had put an end to all the sha∣dowy Offerings under that Law.</P>
<P N="3">3. This the Author of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> did so well understand, that he positively declared that <HI>the Levitical Priesthood being changed, there was made of Necessity a Change also of the Law,</HI> (of that Law, by which that Priesthood and the Maintenance of it had stood) See <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 12. And 'tis also evident from Scripture and Primitive Antiquity, that neither the Apostles themselves, nor (for some ages after them) any of the Christians, did meddle with, or at all con∣cern themselves about Tythes; But let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated Part, <HI>viz.</HI> Offer∣ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But after that the Mystery of Iniquity, which in the Apostles time began to work (2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2. 7.) had wrought to that Degree amongst some Christians, and had drawn them so far from the Purity and Sim∣plicity of the Gospel, as to form and model the Church in many things, by and according to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Pat∣tern amongst other Ceremonial Parts of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion, which had been abolished by the Coming and Death of Christ, Tythes were preached up again (about the latter end of the fourth Century, and be∣ginning of the fifth) by some, at first, under the No∣tion
<PB N="20" REF="500"/>
of Alms and Charity (because part of the Tythes under the Levitical Law, were appointed for the Maintenance of the Fatherless, the Widow and the Stranger, <HI>Deut.</HI> 14. 28, 29.) And by others, as then still due by the Mosaic Law, which had required them to be paid to the Levitical Priesthood. Which Plea afterwards (Corruptions increasing in the Church, and in those especially who were called the <HI>Church-Men,</HI> or <HI>Clergy</HI>) more and more prevailing, the Payment of Tythes was re-introduced, as due by those Levitical Laws, which had been given to the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old. And upon that Bottom, Tythes have stood, been claimed and the Claim defended unto this Day.</P>
<P N="5">5. Now, not only he that thus claims, and receives Tythes; but he that consents to, and complies with such Claim, by paying Tythes thus brought in, and thus claimed, doth thereby implicitly, and vertu∣ally (at least) deny that Christ has put an End to the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and consequently that he is come, and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind. And that this may appear as plain as is possible, I shall draw the Matter into an Argument, thus:<LIST>
<ITEM>To uphold any Thing, as still in force, which was to be taken away, and cease at and by the Death of Christ, is to deny that Christ is come and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>But to receive, or pay Tythes now, is to uphold a Thing, as still in force, which was to be taken away, and cease at and by the Death of Christ▪</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore to receive, or pay Tythes now, is to deny that Christ is come, and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind.</ITEM>
</LIST> The <HI>Major</HI> must be granted, and the <HI>Minor</HI> I thus prove.<LIST>
<ITEM>Whatsoever was <HI>a part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> was to be taken away and cease at and by the Death of Christ;</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="21" REF="501"/>
But Tythes were a part of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore Tythes were to be taken away, and cease at and by the Death of Christ:</ITEM>
</LIST> The <HI>Major</HI> here again is unexceptionable; And the <HI>Minor</HI> is thus proved.<LIST>
<ITEM>Every <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> among the <HI>Jews</HI> was <HI>a Part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>But Tythes were an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> Num. 18. 24.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore Tythes were <HI>a Part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="6">6. By this it appears, that without regard had of the Person to whom, or the Use for which Tythes are paid, the paying of Tythes (as well as the re∣ceiving them) being <HI>a Part</HI> of the abrogated Ceremo∣nial Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> imports a denyal of the Coming, and Death of <HI>Christ.</HI> Hence it is, that Tythes have been, and are commonly called <HI>Antichristian,</HI> or <HI>a∣gainst Christ.</HI> And hence hath risen that saying (often used not only by our antient Friends, but by some of the Martyrs long before) <HI>viz. He that pays Tythes, doth thereby deny that Christ is come in the Flesh.</HI> That Conclusion could not have been drawn, from the pay∣ing of Tythes to a wrong Ministry, or for a wrong use only, though such Payment be evil: Nor could any thing justify that Inference, but the Considera∣tion that Tythes, depending on the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> which must of Necessity and in course fall, and cease when Christ suffered; the paying of Tythes carries in it a supposal, that that Law is not yet cea∣sed, but is still in force: and consequently that Christ, whose Death must needs have ended it, is not yet come, nor has yet suffered in his Flesh for Mankind.</P>
<P N="7">7. That other Objection, not less weighty than common against paying Tythes to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> so call∣ed, <HI>viz.</HI> The unlawfulness of upholding a false Mi∣nistry, to perform a false Worship (being it self so

clear and plain, that it needs no illustration) I shall, in this Discourse, no further meddle with, than to observe in my way, how far it may affect those Ty∣thes also, which the <HI>Impropriators</HI> claim. Wherefore having premised what is said before concerning Tythes in general, to what Hand, or for what Use so∣ever paid, let us now inquire into those Tythes, which are called <HI>Impropriate.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Of Impropriate</HI> TYTHES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THAT these Tythes, which are claimed by the <HI>Impropriators,</HI> are of the same Nature, and stand originally on the same Root and Ground, on which the other Tythes stand, which are claimed and exacted by the <HI>Priests,</HI> is evident from hence, that they were all heretofore, these as well as those, claim∣ed by, and paid to some or other of the <HI>Romish Clergy,</HI> or their Appendices, the Religious Orders (so called) and upon the same Foot. That is, These <HI>Impropriate Tythes</HI> were paid to those Religious Orders or Houses, as being due to God, by vertue of the <HI>Levitic Law;</HI> as well as the other Tythes were paid to the <HI>Parish-Priests,</HI> on the same supposed Right, from the same Law. But how these Tythes came to those Religious Houses first, and how afterwards from them to the <HI>Impropriators,</HI> is next to be inquired.</P>
<P N="2">2. Until the <HI>Lateran Council</HI> (so named, because it was holden in the <HI>Pope's</HI> Palace at <HI>Rome,</HI> called the <HI>Lateran</HI>) in the Year 1215. It was in the choice of eve∣ry Man to give his Tythes to what Church he pleased, so he gave them to some Church. And even after that Council, the <HI>Popes,</HI> as Heads of that Church, by their dispencing Power, did give leave to such as would sue, and pay for it, to give their Tythes from the <HI>Parish-Priest,</HI> to such Order of Religious People (whe∣ther <HI>Monks, Friers,</HI> or <HI>Nuns</HI>) as they were best affected to. By which means, the <HI>Parish-Priests</HI> (called <HI>Seculars,</HI>)
<PB N="23" REF="503"/>
and those of the several Religious Orders (called by a general Title, <HI>Regulars</HI>) being left to scramble, as they could, for maintenance, the <HI>Regulars</HI> (<HI>mendicant Fryers,</HI> and others) swarming in all Places, and pre∣tending, at least, to greater Sanctity, and Austerity of Life, than the <HI>Parish-Priests,</HI> prevailed with the People, either living or dying, to give not only very considerable Estates in Lands, but also the Tythes of other Lands, and of whole Parishes, from the <HI>Pa∣rish-Priests,</HI> to their Religious Houses or Convents.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Tythes, or Parsonages, so given, were then called <HI>Appropriations,</HI> because they were appropriated to this, that, or the other Religious House or Con∣vent. And I have read, that there were in <HI>England</HI> about 3845 Parsonages thus appropriated. And as Tythes were then held to be <HI>due to God and holy Church;</HI> and those Religious Orders were reputed a part of that Church: So the Tythes, as well as the Lands thus given them, were continued to them, and possessed by them, till that general Storm arose, in K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. his time, which overturned those Religious Houses and Orders together. And here, by the way, it may be noted, That while those Religious Houses stood, a great part of the Lands which had been given to them, were, by Papal Authority, exempted from paying Tythes: Whence it is, that many of those Estates, which had belonged to those Religious Houses, remain discharged from the Burden of Tythes still.</P>
<P N="4">4. As Tythes were set up here on the Authority of the <HI>Levitic Law,</HI> and in imitation of the <HI>Jewish Pra∣ctice,</HI> consonant to that Law: So while those Reli∣gious Houses stood, and the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Power prevailed here, not only the <HI>Seculars</HI> or <HI>Parish-Priests,</HI> but all those <HI>Regulars</HI> who received Tythes, were bound to pay the <HI>Tenths</HI> out of the Tythes they received to the Head of their Church, the <HI>Pope</HI> as the <HI>Levites,</HI> under the Ceremonial Law, were required to do to the Priests.</P>
<P N="5">5. But after that K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. (upon a Quarrel be∣tween
<PB N="24" REF="504"/>
the <HI>Pope</HI> and him, about his Divorce from his first Queen <HI>Catharine,</HI> which he earnestly desired, and the <HI>Pope</HI> would not grant) fell off from the <HI>Pope</HI> (though not from <HI>Popery:</HI> For after that, he retained the most pernicious Doctrines of the <HI>Romish Church,</HI> contained in the six Articles, and burnt some for de∣nying them) he threw off the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Supremacy here, and assumed it to himself; declaring himself, and being declared, first by the <HI>Clergy</HI> in their <HI>Convoca∣tion,</HI> and soon after by <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> in <HI>Parlia∣ment, The only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of England.</HI> This was done by the Statute of 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. c. 1. And therein it is enacted. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the King, his Heirs and Successors, Kings of this Realm, shall be taken, accepted and reputed the only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> And shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, as well the Title and Stile thereof, as all Honours, Dignities, Praeeminences, Ju∣risdictions, Privileges, Authorities, Immunities, Pro∣fits and Commodities to the said Dignity of Su∣pream Head of the same Church belonging and ap∣pertaining. And shall have full Power and Autho∣rity, from time to time, to Visit, Repress, Redress, Reform, Order, Correct, Restrain and Amend all such Errors, Heresies, Abuses, Offences, Contempts and Enormities whatsoever they be, which by any manner of Spiritual Authority and Jurisdiction ought, or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, or∣dered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By which it is evident, the Intention of the <HI>Parliament</HI> then was to transfer, confer and settle un∣to and upon King <HI>Henry</HI> all the Powers, Profits and Privileges, which had been before supposed to be in, or belong to, or had been enjoyed or exercised by the <HI>Pope,</HI> while he was received as <HI>Supream Head of the Church.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. And therefore, as the <HI>Pope,</HI> while he retained the
<PB N="25" REF="505"/>
<HI>Supremacy</HI> here, had the first Fruits (which are the Profits of every Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Living for one Year, upon the advancing of any Ecclesiastical Person, to such a Living; and also the <HI>Tenths,</HI> that is the <HI>tenth Part</HI> of all the Tythes: So these two Reve∣nues, as appendant to that <HI>Supremacy,</HI> followed it; being settled on the King, in the same Session of Par∣liament, wherein the Supremacy was vested in him. The Words of the Statute, 26 <HI>H.</HI> 8. c. 3. relating to the <HI>first Fruits,</HI> are these. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That for the more sure∣ty of Continuance and Augmentation of his High¦ness Royal Estate, being not only now recognized (as he always indeed hath heretofore been) the only Supream Head in Earth, next and immediatly un∣der God, of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but also their most assured and undoubted natural Soveraign Liege Lord and King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may therefore be enacted and ordained by, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That the King's Highness, his Heirs and Successors, Kings of this Realm, shall have and enjoy from time to time to endure for e∣ver, of every such Person and Persons, which at any time after the first Day of <HI>January</HI> next shall be nominated, elected, perfected, presented, collated or by any other means appointed to have any Arch-Bi∣shoprick, Abbacy, Monastery, Priory, Colledge, Hospital, Archdeaconry, Deanry, Provostship, Prebend, Parsonage, Vicarage, Chauntry, Free-Chap∣pel, or other Dignity, Benefice, Office, or Pro∣motion Spiritual, within this Realm, or elswhere within any of the King's Dominions, of what Name, Nature, or Quality soever they be, or to whose Foundation, Patronage, or Gift soever they belong, the First-Fruits, Revenues and Profits for one Year of every such Arch-Bishoprick, Bishop∣rick, Abby, Monastery, Priory,— Parsonage, Vicar∣age,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then (after Provisions made for finding out the value of those Spiritual Livings, and for paying, receiving and recovering those <HI>First-Fruits</HI>)
<PB N="26" REF="506"/>
the Settlement of the <HI>Tenths</HI> (that other part of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Revenue) upon the King, follows, in the same Statute, in these Words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'And over this, be it enacted by Authority a∣foresaid, that the Kings Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, Kings of this Realm, for more Augmenta∣tion and Maintenance of the Royal Estate of his Imperial Crown and Dignity of Supream Head of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> shall yearly have, take, enjoy and receive, united and knit to his Impe∣rial Crown for ever, one yearly Rent, or Pension, amounting to the value of the Tenth Part of all the Revenues, Rents, Farms, Tythes, Offerings, Emoluments, and of all other Profits as well called Spiritual as Temporal, now appertaining or be∣longing, or that hereafter shall belong to any Archbishoprick, Bishoprick, Abbacy, Monastery, Priory, Archdeaconry, Deanry, Hospital, Col∣ledge, House-Collegiate, Prebend, Cathedral Church, Collegiate-Church, Conventual-Church, Parsonage, Vicarage, Chauntry, Free-Chappel, or other Be∣nefice or Promotion Spiritual, of what Name, Nature, or Quality soever they be, within any Diocess of this Realm, or in Wales,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And so goes on to direct the time, place and manner of Payment of these Tenths, with the Penalty for non-payment.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thus were these two great Pillars of <HI>Papal Su∣premacy (First Fruits</HI> and <HI>Tenths</HI>) transferr'd from the <HI>Pope,</HI> (the old Head,) to the King, (the new Head of the Church,) to support and maintain that Headship in him, as they had done before in the <HI>Pope.</HI> Which Ecclesiastical Headship the King was no sooner possessed of, than he began to exercise it a∣mongst those Religious Orders, Suppressing (as <HI>Her∣bert,</HI> in his Life, p. 379. relates) the <HI>Observant Fryers</HI> at <HI>Greenwich, Canterbury, Richmond</HI> and o∣ther Places, and substituting the <HI>Augustines</HI> in their
<PB N="27" REF="507"/>
Places. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Which he did (says <HI>Herbert</HI> there) for the finding out how his People would take his Design of putting down Religious Houses:</Q> To which he pro∣ceeded the next Year, beginning with the lesser Sort, and suppressing all those Monasteries, Priories and other Religious Houses of <HI>Monks, Canons,</HI> and <HI>Nuns,</HI> which had not in Lands, Tenements, Rents, Tythes, Portions, and other Hereditaments, above the clear yearly Value of two hundred Pounds. By which means 376 of those Religious Houses being dissolv∣ed, a Revenue of above thirty thousand Pounds a Year, beside an hundred thousand Pounds in Money raised by sale, at low Rates, of the Goods and Chat∣tels, of those Houses (a Sum not small in that Age) came to the King, for support of his Ecclesiastical Supremacy.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Statute, which countenanced this Proceed∣ing, is the 27. of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 28. And a new Court, called <HI>the Court of Augmentations,</HI> was then erected and settled by Parliament, for receiving and order∣ing these new accessional Revenues: the Act for which, in our printed Statute Books, is set before that for the Suppression of those lesser Monasteries. But though that, for Suppressing those Monasteries, be, by an <HI>Hysterosis,</HI> set after that for establishing the <HI>Court of Augmentations;</HI> Yet it must have been made before it: For it is recited in it.</P>
<P N="9">9. In that Statute, 27 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. 28. for suppressing those smaller Monasteries, mention is made of Mo∣nasteries, Abbies, and Priores, which, within one Year before the making of that Statute, had been given and granted to the King by any Abbot, Prior, Abbess or Prioress, under their Convent-Seal, or that otherwise had been suppressed, or dissolved. All which were, by that Statute confirmed to the King, and to all those, unto whom the King either then before had conveyed, or then after should convey any Part or Parts thereof; 'To hold to them in like Manner,
<PB N="28" REF="508"/>
Form, and Conditions, as the Abbots, Priors, Abbesses, Prioresses, and other chief Governors of any religious Houses, which had the same, might or ought to have had if they had not been suppressed. For upon the King's falling (as was noted before) upon the Observant <HI>Fryers</HI> at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and other places, some of the more considerate of the <HI>Abbots, Priors,</HI> &amp;c. Seeing the Storm arising, which then threatned, and soon after brought Destruction on those Orders, thought it better Policy to comply with the times, and surrender upon Terms, in hopes to save something, than hold out to the last (as many did) and lose all.</P>
<P N="10">10. And indeed, the suppressing of those 376 lesser Mo∣nasteries, struck so great a Fear into the greater, that the Statute made four Years after (31 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 13.) whereby the Rest of the Religious Houses were given to the King, recites, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That divers and sundry Ab∣bots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of their own free and voluntary Mind, since the fourth of <HI>Feb.</HI> in the 27 of his Reign, had by due Order of Law, and by their sufficient Writ∣ings of Record, under their Convent and common Seals, severally given, granted and confirmed to the King his Heirs and Successors for ever, All their said Monasteries, Abbeys, Priories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all the Mannors, Lord-ships, Lands, Tenements, <HI>Tythes,</HI> &amp;c. to them belonging; and had voluntarily renounc∣ed, left and forsaken the same.</Q> And therefore, in the said Statute it is enacted, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the King shall have, hold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All such late Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all the Sites, Circuits, Manners, Lands, Tenements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thereunto belonging.</Q> In the ennumeration of the Particulars whereof, (which are many) <HI>Tythes,</HI> Parsonages, appropriate, and Vicarages are expresly mentioned. All which (as likewise all other Religi∣ous Houses, with the Revenues thereof, which should there after be dissolved, suppressed, relinquished, for∣feited, or given to the King, and which by that Sta∣tute are settled on him) he was to hold and enjoy,
<PB N="29" REF="509"/>
in as large and ample Manner, and Form, as the late Abbots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had held or of right ought to have held, the same, in Right of their said late Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. From hence this Observation arises. That since those Religious Orders did hold the <HI>Tythes</HI> which they possessed, upon the supposed Right of their being due <HI>to God and Holy Church,</HI> which they held themselves, and were by others holden to be a part of; and the King received those <HI>Tythes</HI> and <HI>Parsonages</HI> (amongst the rest of the Revenues of the Religious Houses) as well those that were resigned to him by the Govern∣ours of those Houses themselves, as the rest which by Act of Parliament he took, upon the same Right on which those Religious Orders had holden them: He also must hold them upon that supposed Right of their being due <HI>to God and Holy Church;</HI> which he then held himself, and was holden by all, both <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity,</HI> to be the only <HI>Supream Head</HI> of here in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> And as upon that supposed Right (of their be∣ing <HI>due to God and Holy Church</HI>) on which the Reli∣gious Houses held them, they passed them from those Houses to the King, as <HI>supream Head of the Church:</HI> So on the same supposed Right (of their being <HI>due to God and Holy Church</HI>) they passed from the King, as <HI>supream Head of the Church,</HI> to those (whether <HI>Spiri∣tual</HI> or <HI>Lay</HI> Persons) unto whom the King granted them. For they stuck not long in the King's Hand: But he, of his own meer Motion, Liberality and Be∣nignity (as the Statute in the 33d Year of his Reign, cap. 39. relates) had by that time freely given and granted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unto divers and sundry of the Lords and Nobles, as well <HI>Spiritual</HI> as <HI>Temporal,</HI> and unto divers and many other Persons and Bodies politick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> divers and many sundry Honours, Castles, Ma∣nors, Lands, Tenements, and among the rest, <HI>Re∣ctories,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="12">12. But great care was taken to retain, and keep up the Character of <HI>Spirituality,</HI> which had formerly been
<PB N="30" REF="510"/>
stamped upon those <HI>Rectories, Parsonages,</HI> and other Revenues by <HI>Tythes,</HI> into what Hands soever they were passed. And therefore, by the Statute of 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 7. in case of with-holding, or denying to pay the Tythes, all Persons claiming them <HI>(Impropria∣tors,</HI> as well as <HI>Priests)</HI> are restrained from suing in the <HI>Temporal Courts,</HI> and limitted to the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Courts</HI> only, for the Recovery of them.</P>
<P N="13">13. And that they might still have Dependence upon the <HI>Supremacy,</HI> care was taken, from the first, by the Statute of 27 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 27. That none of these Estates, which then had come, or should come, from any of those Religious Houses to the King, should pass from him by Grant to any Person whatsoever, without an express Reservation of a <HI>Tenth.</HI> And in a subsequent Statute (33 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 39.) complaint being made that, altho' out of those Grants, which the King had made to sundry Persons, of Honours, Castles, Mannors, Lands, Tenements, Rectories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which were under the Survey of the <HI>Court of Aug∣mentations</HI>) the <HI>Tenths</HI> had been reserved; yet the Persons unto whom such Grants had been made, though they had quietly enjoyed and taken the Issues and Profits of those Lands, Rectories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had not paid the reserved <HI>Tenths</HI> to the King: Provision was made in that Statute, by several <HI>Forfeitures</HI> and <HI>No∣mine-Poenae</HI>'s to enforce the Payment thereof.</P>
<P>Nor was Care taken of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Head</HI> (the <HI>King</HI>) only, but of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Members</HI> (the <HI>Clergy</HI>) also: Many, if not most, of which had Pen∣sions, or Portions issuing out of those Parsonages, Re∣ctories, or other spiritual Benefices (as they were counted) which the Religious Orders held: for, be∣sides that upon the increasing of those <HI>Appropriations,</HI> whereby the <HI>Parish Priests</HI> were pinch'd, there had been Provision made early, in the time of K. <HI>Richard</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> for the <HI>Vicars,</HI> as well as for the <HI>Poor;</HI> the Statute of 15 <HI>Ric.</HI> 2. 6. directing, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That, upon the
<PB N="31" REF="511"/>
<HI>Appropriation</HI> of such Churches, the <HI>Diocaesian</HI> of the Place (or Bishop of the Diocess) shall ordain, according to the Value of such Churches, a conve∣nient Sum of Money to be paid and distributed Yearly, of the Fruits and Profits of the same Churches, to the poor Parishioners: and also, that the Vicar be well and sufficiently endowed.</Q> Which Statute (so far, at least, as concerned the Vicars) was afterwards confirmed by another Statute of 4 <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. cap. 12. which expresly ordains, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the Statute of Appropriation of Churches, and of the Endow∣ment of Vicars in the same, made the 15th Year of K. <HI>Ric.</HI> the 2<HI>d</HI> be firmly holden, and put in due Exe∣cution:</Q> I say, besides these, the Stat. of 34 and 35 of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 19. takes notice, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the Arch-Bi∣shops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons and other Ecclesia∣stical Persons, of both Provinces of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> having formerly, in right of their Churches received out of the late Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> divers Pensions, and other Profits, had after the Dissoluti∣on of those Houses, been disturbed, and denyed of the having, receiving and gathering of the said Pen∣sions,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereupon it is, in the said Statute, enacted, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That if any Person or Persons, being Far∣mer or Occupier of any Manners, Lands, Tene∣ments, Parsonages, Benefices or other Hereditaments of any of the said late Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the King's Gift, Grant, Sale, Exchange, or otherwise, out of which any such Pensions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have been here∣tofore lawfully going, answered or Paid to any of the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons, and o∣ther Ecclesiastical Persons abovesaid, do, at any time after the first Day of <HI>April</HI> next coming, wil∣fully deny the Payment thereof, Then it shall be lawful for the said Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons, or other Ecclesiastical Persons aforesaid, being so denied, to be satisfied and paid thereof, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to proceed in the Ecclesiastical Courts, for the re∣covery thereof.</Q></P>
<P N="14"><PB N="32" REF="512"/>
14. By which Statute, all Pensions payable to Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons, or other Ecclesiasti∣cal Person, that had been possessed thereof, at or within Ten Years next before the time of the Disso∣lution of the Monasteries, out of the Parsonages, Re∣ctories, or Tythes holden by the said Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are confirmed and assured to such Arch-Bishops, Bi∣shops, Arch-Deacons, and other Ecclesiastical Per∣sons still.</P>
<P N="15">15. So that, upon the whole, besides what hath been said of Tythes in general, with respect to the <HI>Judaizing,</HI> and denying of Christ, by the paying thereof (which extends a like to all <HI>Tythes,</HI> those claimed by the <HI>Impro∣priator,</HI> as well as those claimed by the <HI>Priest</HI>) the <HI>Im∣propriate Tythes</HI> being generally charged, either with some Payment to the <HI>Vicars,</HI> for enlarging of their <HI>Stipends,</HI> or with <HI>Pensions</HI> to the Arch-Bishops, Bi∣shops, Arch-Deacons, and other Ecclesiasticks: all such of them as are so charged, come under the same Objection, that is made against paying to the Priest, <HI>viz.</HI> The upholding of a false Ministry, to perform a false Worship. And if any <HI>Impropriation</HI> may be supposed to be free from all those Charges: yet all <HI>Impropriators,</HI> as well as <HI>Priests,</HI> being bound to pay the reserved <HI>Tenths</HI> to the King, as <HI>Supream Head of the Church</HI> (which were wont before to be paid to the <HI>Pope,</HI> while he was owned for <HI>Head of the Church</HI>) the paying of Tythes to an <HI>Impropria∣tor,</HI> is a <HI>Recognizing,</HI> and <HI>acknowledging</HI> of a Man (Bad or Good, <HI>Popish</HI> or <HI>Protestant,</HI> as it happens) to be the only <HI>Supream Head on Earth of the Church.</HI> Which is to set an <HI>Human Head</HI> to a <HI>Spiritual Body:</HI> and to divest and deprive our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> of his undoubted Right, who the Apostle says expres∣ly, is <HI>the Head of the Body, the Church,</HI> Col. 1. 18. <HI>And that not of Man's making or appointing; but God</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>hath given him to be the Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body,</HI> Ephes. 1. 22, 23.</P>
