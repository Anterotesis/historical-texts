<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Age of <HI>Theatric change,</HI> when TRAGEDIES have found themselves to be COMEDIES, and CO∣MEDIES have bordered upon PANTOMIME; nothing has changed so little as <HI>Pantomime</HI> itself. <HI>Harle∣quin</HI> skips away his Passion;—<HI>Colombine</HI> foots it to the same Tune;—the chosen <HI>Lover</HI> slides across the Stage, melancholy and gentlemanlike;—the <HI>Clown</HI> breaks his Head pleasantly against the Scene, and the <HI>Father</HI> tumbles over him, in the same Way, and fortunately with the same Merriment, he has done any Time these Hundred Years.</P>
<P>These Witticisms are certainly good ones, for they are undoubtedly the oldest, and of the longest standing of any in Christendom.</P>
<P>But one Jest cannot unfortunately live for ever. In the East Indies, the same Joke lasts only a Twelvemonth, and is terminated by the Arrival of the next Ships.</P>
<P>For this Reason, the Author of the Pantomime, in which the following Songs bear a Part, has attempted to stray from the beaten Road; but it is requested the Audience will not be alarmed. The
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
Hero of to Night is not about to be a Man of Sentiment; tho' <HI>Othello</HI> might be such with a black Face, he had not the good, or the ill Fortune, to have a Party-colour'd Jacket, which cuts short all Sen∣timent at once.</P>
<P>The Novelty attempted to be dramatised To-night, takes its Rise from the Writings of MISS AIKIN, and the HON. HORACE WALPOLE. The <HI>Castle of Otranto,</HI> and <HI>the Fragment of Sir Bertrand,</HI> form the Basis of an Endeavour to bring upon the Stage somewhat of the Effects which may be pro∣duced by Midnight Horror, and Agency super∣natural. What may be the Result of this Experi∣ment, To-night must determine, for hitherto the Experiment has not been made.</P>
<P>The Ghost of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and the Witches of <HI>Mac∣beth</HI> do not militate against this Assertion. Their Appearance, tho' out of Nature, was simple and not combined. The Clank of Chains, the Whistling of hollow Winds, the Clapping of Doors, Gigantic Forms, and visionary Gleams of Light, attended not their Effects upon the Stage. The firm Mind certainly may laugh at all this; but if ever, on a late Winter Evening, at a well-told Story of an Appari∣tion, the Company have found themselves unusu∣ally attentive, and sometimes unwittingly look'd back;—if they have felt no Wish to part;—if imper∣ceptibly they have sat more closely together, and heard the Summons to Rest and Separation,—the retiring to a lone Chamber with Reluctance, not
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
to say Disquietude;—if all this has happen'd, then are we right in thinking there is somewhat of En∣thusiasm, or Superstition in these Matters, which Reason smiles at, but cannot prevail over.—</P>
<P>If this is a Weakness, the greatest and the best of all Times have felt its Force;—<HI>Henry the Fourth,</HI> the great <HI>Duke of Marlborough,</HI>—and a Family of Rank in this Country, with whom the Author has had the Honor of being intimate, were remar∣kable Instances of this Truth.</P>
<P>Mix'd up with lighter Things to counteract the Gloom, some Grains of this Species of Composition will form the Potion of the Pantomime in Question; in other Matters the Author humbly hopes he shall not be more dull than his Neighbours have been before him: perhaps quite as nonsensical, and sometimes more absurd.—He trusts, however, the Audience will not be displeased with him, for having substituted a <HI>talkative Attendant</HI> upon <HI>Har∣lequin</HI> in the room of the usual <HI>Dumb Grimace</HI> of the <HI>Clown,</HI> or having given them the youthful Accom∣plishments of Miss WILKINSON as a <HI>Colombine</HI> in the Place of a <HI>Figurante.</HI></P>
