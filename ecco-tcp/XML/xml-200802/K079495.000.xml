<HEAD>EPISTLE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN vain, dear Monitor, thy kind desire</L>
<L>To wake the embers of poetic fire!</L>
<L>To clear the mind, where Grief's dark shadows lower,</L>
<L>And Fancy dies by Sorrow's freezing power!</L>
<L N="5">In vain would Friendship's chearing voice suggest</L>
<L>Her flattering visions to the Poet's breast;</L>
<L>That public favor calls, with just demand,</L>
<L>Th' expected volume from his lingering hand:</L>
<L>Lost are those anxious hopes, that eager pride,</L>
<L N="10">With thee, my THORNTON, they declin'd, they died.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Friend of my opening soul! whose love began</L>
<L>To hail thy Poet, ere he rank'd as man!</L>
<L>Whose praise, like dew-drops, which the early morn</L>
<L>Sheds with mild virtue on the vernal thorn,</L>
<L N="15">Taught his young mind each swell of thought to shew,</L>
<L>And gave the germs of fancy strength to blow!</L>
<L>Dear, firm associate of his studious hour,</L>
<L>Who led his idler step to Learning's bower!</L>
<L>Tho' young, imparting to his giddier youth</L>
<L N="20">Thy thirst of science, and thy zeal for truth!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye towers of Granta, where our friendship grew,</L>
<L>And that pure mind expanded to my view,</L>
<L>Our love fraternal let thy walls attest,</L>
<L>Where Attic joys our letter'd evening blest;</L>
<L N="25">Where midnight, from the chains of sleep reliev'd,</L>
<L>Stole on our social studies unperceiv'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<L>But not, my THORNTON! in that calm alone</L>
<L>Was thy mild genius, thy warm virtue known:</L>
<L>When manhood mark'd the hour for busy strife,</L>
<L N="30">And led us to the crowded maze of life,</L>
<L>From whence to sweet retirement's soothing shade,</L>
<L>Love and the Muse thy willing friend convey'd;</L>
<L>Thy soul, more firm to join the struggling crowd,</L>
<L>To nobler Themis toilsome homage vow'd,</L>
<L N="35">With zeal, devoting to her sacred throne</L>
<L>A heart as uncorrupted as her own.</L>
<L>Still as thy mind, with manly powers endued,</L>
<L>The opening path of active life pursued,</L>
<L>And round the ripening field of business rang'd,</L>
<L N="40">Thy heart, unwarp'd, unharden'd, unestrang'd,</L>
<L>To early friendship still retain'd its truth,</L>
<L>With all the warm integrity of youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<L>Whene'er affliction's force thy friend opprest,</L>
<L>Thou wer't the rock on which his cares might rest;</L>
<L N="45">From thy kind words his rising hopes would own</L>
<L>The charm of reason in affection's tone.</L>
<L>Where is the soothing voice of equal power,</L>
<L>To take it's anguish from the present hour?</L>
<L>Beneath the pressure of a grief so just,</L>
<L N="50">The lenient aid of books in vain I trust:</L>
<L>They, that could once the war of thought controul,</L>
<L>And banish discord from the jarring soul,</L>
<L>Now irritate the mind, they used to heal,</L>
<L>They speak too loudly of the loss I feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="55">Thou faithful censor of the Poet's strain,</L>
<L>No more shalt thou his sinking hope sustain,</L>
<L>No more, with ardent zeal's enlivening fire,</L>
<L>Call from inglorious shades his silent lyre:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
No more, as in our days of pleasure past,</L>
<L N="60">The eye of judgment o'er his labors cast;</L>
<L>Keen to discern the blemishes, that lurk</L>
<L>In the loose texture of his growing work;</L>
<L>Eager to praise, yet resolute to blame,</L>
<L>Kind to his verse, but kinder to his fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="65">How may the Muse, who prosper'd by thy care,</L>
<L>Now meet the public eye without despair?</L>
<L>Now, if harsh censures on her failings pour,</L>
<L>Her warmest advocate can speak no more:</L>
<L>Cold are those lips, which breath'd the kind defence,</L>
<L N="70">If spleen's proud cavil strain'd her tortur'd sense;</L>
<L>Which bade her song to public praise aspire,</L>
<L>And call'd attention to her trembling lyre.</L>
<L>Ah! could she now, thus petrified with grief,</L>
<L>Find in some lighter lay a vain relief,</L>
<L N="75"><PB N="10" REF="8"/>
Still must she deem such verse, if such could be,</L>
<L>A wound to friendship, and a crime to thee;</L>
<L>Profanely utter'd at this sacred time,</L>
<L>When thy pale corse demands her plaintive rhime,</L>
<L>And Virtue, weeping whom she could not save,</L>
<L N="80">Calls the just mourner to thy recent grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail hallow'd vault! whose darksome caverns hold</L>
<L>A frame, though mortal, of no common mould;</L>
<L>A heart scarce sullied with a human flaw,</L>
<L>Which shun'd no duty, and transgress'd no law;</L>
<L N="85">In joy still guarded, in distress serene,</L>
<L>Thro' life a model of the golden mean,</L>
<L>Which friendship only led him to transgress,</L>
<L>Whose purer spirit sanctifies excess.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pure mind! whose meekness, in thy mortal days,</L>
<L N="90">Pursuing virtue, still retir'd from praise;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
Nor wish'd that friendship should on marble give</L>
<L>That perfect image of thy worth to live,</L>
<L>Which 'twas thy aim alone to leave imprest</L>
<L>On the close tablet of her faithful breast.</L>
<L N="95">If now her verse against thy wish rebel,</L>
<L>And strive to blazon, what she lov'd so well,</L>
<L>Forgive the tender thought, the moral song,</L>
<L>Which would thy virtues to the world prolong;</L>
<L>That, rescued from the grave's oblivious shade,</L>
<L N="100">Their useful lustre may be still survey'd,</L>
<L>Dear to the pensive eye of fond regret,</L>
<L>As light still beaming from a sun that's set.</L>
<L>Oft to our giddy Muse thy voice has taught</L>
<L>The just ambition of poetic thought;</L>
<L N="105">Bid her bold view to latest time extend,</L>
<L>And strive to make futurity her friend.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>
If any verse, her little art can frame,</L>
<L>May win the partial voice of distant fame,</L>
<L>Be it the verse, whose fond ambition tries</L>
<L N="110">To paint thy mind in truth's unfading dyes,</L>
<L>Tho' firm, yet tender, ardent, yet refin'd;</L>
<L>With Roman strength and Attic grace combin'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tho' undeck'd with titles, power, and wealth,</L>
<L>Great were thy generous deeds, and done by stealth;</L>
<L N="115">For thy pure bounty from observance stole,</L>
<L>Nor wish'd applause, but from thy conscious soul.</L>
<L>Tho' thy plain tomb no sculptur'd form may shew,</L>
<L>No boastful witness of suspected woe;</L>
<L>Yet heavenly shapes, that shun the glare of day,</L>
<L N="120">To that dear spot shall nightly visits pay:</L>
<L>Pale Science there shall o'er her votary strew</L>
<L>Her flow'rs, yet moist with sorrow's recent dew.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="11"/>
There Charity, Compassion's lovely child,</L>
<L>In rustic notes pathetically wild,</L>
<L N="125">With grateful blessings bid thy name endure,</L>
<L>And mourn the patron of her village-poor.</L>
<L>E'en from the midnight shew with music gay,</L>
<L>The soul of Beauty to thy tomb shall stray,</L>
<L>In sweet distraction steal from present mirth,</L>
<L N="130">To sigh unnotic'd o'er the hallow'd earth,</L>
<L>Which hides those lips, that glow'd with tender fire,</L>
<L>And sung her praises to no common lyre:</L>
<L>But Friendship, wrapt in sorrow's deepest gloom,</L>
<L>Shall keep the longest vigils at thy tomb;</L>
<L N="135">Her wounded breast, disdainful of relief,</L>
<L>There claims a fond praeeminence in grief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Short was thy life, but ah! its thread how fine!</L>
<L>How pure the texture of the finish'd line!</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="12"/>
What tho' thy opening manhood could not gain</L>
<L N="140">Those late rewards, maturer toils attain;</L>
<L>Hope's firmest promises 'twas thine to raise,</L>
<L>That merit's brightest meed would grace thy lengthen'd days;</L>
<L>For thine were Judgment's patient powers, to draw</L>
<L>Entangled justice from the nets of law;</L>
<L N="145">Thine firm Integrity, whose language clear</L>
<L>Ne'er swell'd with arrogance, or shook with fear.</L>
<L>Reason's mild power, unvex'd by mental strife,</L>
<L>Sway'd the calm current of thy useful life;</L>
<L>Whose even course was in no season lost,</L>
<L N="150">Nor rough with storms, nor stagnated by frost.</L>
<L>In scenes of public toil, or social ease,</L>
<L>'Twas thine by firm sincerity to please;</L>
<L>Sweet as the breath of spring thy converse flow'd,</L>
<L>As summer's noon-tide warmth thy friendship glow'd.</L>
<L N="155"><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
O'er thy mild manners, by no art constrain'd,</L>
<L>A pensive, pleasing melancholy reign'd,</L>
<L>Which won regard, and charm'd th' attentive eye,</L>
<L>Like the soft lustre of an evening sky:</L>
<L>Yet if perchance excited to defend</L>
<L N="160">The injur'd merit of an absent friend,</L>
<L>That gentle spirit, rous'd to virtuous ire,</L>
<L>Indignant flash'd resentment's noble fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' just observance in thy life may trace</L>
<L>A lovely model of each moral grace,</L>
<L N="165">Thy last of days the noblest lesson taught:</L>
<L>Severe instruction! and too dearly bought!</L>
<L>Whose force from memory never can depart,</L>
<L>But while it mends, must agonize the heart.</L>
<L>Tho' thy shrunk nerves were destin'd to sustain</L>
<L N="170">Th' increasing horrors of slow-wasting pain;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="14"/>
Those spirit-quenching pangs, whose base controul</L>
<L>Cloud the clear temper, and exhaust the soul;</L>
<L>Yet in that hour, when Death asserts his claim,</L>
<L>And his strong summons shakes the conscious frame;</L>
<L N="175">When weaker minds, by frantic fear o'erthrown,</L>
<L>Shrink in wild horror from the dread Unknown,</L>
<L>Thy firmer soul, with Christian strength renew'd,</L>
<L>Nor lost in languor, nor by pain subdued,</L>
<L>(While thy cold grasp the hand of Friendship prest,</L>
<L N="180">And her vain aid in fault'ring accents blest)</L>
<L>With awe, but not as Superstition's slave,</L>
<L>Survey'd the gathering shadows of the grave;</L>
<L>And to thy God, in death, devoutly paid</L>
<L>That calm obedience which thy life display'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="185">Thou friend! yet left me of the choicer few,</L>
<L>Whom grief's fond eyes with growing love review;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="15"/>
O thou! whom mutual sorrow will incline</L>
<L>To mix thy sympathetic sighs with mine;</L>
<L>Still be it ours to pay, with just regret,</L>
<L N="190">At Friendship's sacred shrine our common debt!</L>
<L>Tho' doom'd (so Heaven ordains) to see no more</L>
<L>The gentle Being, whom we both deplore;</L>
<L>Painting shall still, sweet soothing art! supply</L>
<L>A form so precious in affection's eye.</L>
<L N="195">Ah! little thought we, in that happier hour,</L>
<L>When our gay Muse rehears'd the Pencil's power;</L>
<L>To mourn that form in cold obstruction laid,</L>
<L>And see him only by the pencil's aid!</L>
<L>Blest be that pencil, every art be blest,</L>
<L N="200">That stamps his image deeper on our breast!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft let us loiter on his favourite hill,</L>
<L>Whose shades the sadly-pleasing thought instill;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="16"/>
Recount his kindness, as we fondly rove,</L>
<L>And meet his spirit in the lonely grove.</L>
<L N="205">At evening's pensive hour, or opening day,</L>
<L>He yet shall seem the partner of our way.</L>
<L>Blest Spirit! still thro' fancy's ear impart</L>
<L>The calm of virtue to the troubled heart!</L>
<L>Correct each sordid view, each vain desire,</L>
<L N="210">And touch the mortal, with celestial fire!</L>
<L>So may we still, in this dark scene of earth,</L>
<L>Hold sweet communion with thy living worth;</L>
<L>And, while our purer thoughts thy merit scan,</L>
<L>Revere the Angel, as we lov'd the Man.</L>
