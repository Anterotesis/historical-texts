<P>MR. FOOTE's Situation rendering it impossible for him to perform the smaller Pieces of his own Writing as often as the PUBLIC would desire them, thought that a SINGING FARCE, though pretend∣ing to no other Merit than that of good MUSIC, would be more acceptable to his AUDITORS than others destitute of that ORNAMENT, which had been often per∣formed at the Winter THEATRES.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="3"/>The DIALOGUE of this Trifle is taken, with some Alterations, from a PLAY of DRYDEN's: In that Part it is inoffensive; and the SONGS, which have been selected with great Care, will, it is hoped, afford Entertainment.</P>

<P>I have spoken to a fast friend of mine, a rene∣gado, who has taken care to prepare a vessel for our de∣parture. To-morrow night the galley will come to the point, west of your garden here, with a dozen Spaniards, all of them able-bodied rowers, and of approved fidelity.</P>

<P>If this be captivity, who would not be a cap∣tive? What a lucky day was it for me when I was set to work upon my master's terras in Algiers, where I was seen from the windows of her father's house by this charming infidel, who singled me from the rest of my companions!</P>

<P>You are confounded.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Somewhat nonplust, I confess, to hear you deny your name so positively. Why, are you not Zo∣rayda, the Cadi's daughter? Did not I see you with him but just now? Nay, were you not so charitable as to give me money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am neither Zorayda, nor the Cadi's daughter.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not that; but I am sure he is old enough to be your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>But once again—How came you to name Zorayda?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another mistake of mine; for asking one of your slaves, when I came into the garden, who were the chief ladies about the house, he answered me Zorayda and Fatima; but she, it seems, is his daughter, (with a plague to her) and you are his beloved wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say your beloved mistress, if you please, for that's the title I desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but I have a qualm of conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your conscience was very quiet when you took me for Zorayda.</P>
</SP>

<P>No, sirrah; but I'll teach you, to your cost, what vengeance is in store for refusing a lady who has offered you her love.</P>

<P>Oh, horrid! abominable! the villain—the monster—take him away, flay and impale him, rid the world of such a viper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>First hear me, worthy sir. What have you seen to provoke you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cadi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard the outcries of my wife, the bleat∣ings of the poor innocent lamb. What have I seen, quotha! If I see the lamb lie expiring, and the wolf by her, is not that evidence sufficient of the murder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray think in reason, Sir. Is a man to be put to death for a similitude? No violence has been com∣mitted; none intended. The lamb's alive; and, if I durst tell you so, no more a lamb than I am a wolf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's that, villain!</P>

<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well.—Hear him speak, husband; perhaps he may say something for himself I know not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cadi.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did he mean no mischief? Was he en∣deavouring nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my conscience I begin to doubt he did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cadi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what meant all those outcries?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard music in the garden, and I stole softly down, imagining it might be he.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cadi.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's that! Imagining it might be he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to be sure, my lord. Am not I the mi∣stress of the family; and is it not my place to see good order kept in it? I thought he might have allured some of the she slaves to him, and was resolved to prevent what might have been betwixt them; when on a sudden he rush'd out upon me, and caught me in his arms with such a fury—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cadi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard enough,—away with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mistaking me, no doubt, for one of the slaves that work in the garden. With that, affrighted as I was, I discovered myself, and cry'd aloud; but as soon as ever he knew me, the villain let me go; and, I must needs say, he started back as if I were a serpent, and was more afraid of me than I of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cadi.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, thou ungrateful villain! Did'st thou come to get footing in my family in order to corrupt it? That's cause enough of death. Once more, again, away with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, love—</P>

<SPEAKER>Cadi.</SPEAKER>

<P>I must speak, and you hear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cadi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away with him, I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fat.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! for an intended trespass? No harm has been done, whatever may be. Then consider he does not belong to you, and is recommended by a friend you would not chuse to disoblige.</P>

<P>Let me consider a little.—Am not I a mad wicked girl, going to forsake my father, and leave my country, to run into a strange one with a slave whose freedom I purchase, and I first saw, by accident, thro' a window in my father's house that look'd into the place where he work'd?—Why, on maturely weighing the matter, not so mad and wicked as I at first appear. I have long hated both our Mahometan laws and religion in my heart, and I have no means to get rid of them both but by putting myself in the hands of a Christian.—This is a handsome man I am sure, and I will believe him an honest one.</P>
<LG>
<L>The wretch condemn'd with life to part,</L>
<L>Yet, yet on hope relies;</L>
<L>And the last sigh that rends his heart,</L>
<L>Bids expectation rise.</L>

<P>As how! What has been the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some cause which my father has lately decided, and, to tell you the truth, I believe not with the strictest attention to justice; however, the party has carryed his complaint to the Dey, and he has been obliged to go to court about it; but he's come back again, and I fancy the storm is pretty well blown over.</P>

<P>This it is to have a sound head-piece.—I have mewed up my suspected spouse in her chamber.—No more embassies to that lusty young Christian. Next, by this habit of a slave, I have made myself as like him as I can. Now walking under the windows of my Seraglio, if Fatima should look out, she will certainly take me for Ferdinand, and call to me, and by that I shall know what concupiscence is working in her. She cannot come down to commit iniquity, there's my safety; but if she peep, if she put her note abroad, there's demon∣stration of her pious will, and let me alone to work her for it.</P>
