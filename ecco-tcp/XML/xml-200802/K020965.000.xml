<L>What need of letters? Wherefore should we spell?</L>

<L>Much are the precious hours of youth mispent,</L>
<L>In climbing Learning's rugged steep ascent;</L>
<L>When to the top the bold advent'rer's got,</L>
<L>He reigns, vain monarch, o'er a barren spot,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Whilst in the <HI>vale</HI> of <HI>Ignorance</HI> below,</L>
<L>FOLLY and VICE to rank luxuriance grow;</L>
<L>Honours and wealth pour in on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>And proud Preferment rolls her golden tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er crabbed authors life's gay prime to waste,</L>
<L>To cramp wild genius in the chains of taste,</L>
<L>To bear the slavish drudgery of schools,</L>
<L>And tamely stoop to ev'ry pedant's rules,</L>
<L>For seven long years debarr'd of lib'ral ease,</L>
<L>To plod in college trammels to <HI>degrees,</HI></L>
<L>Beneath the weight of solemn toys to groan,</L>
<L>Sleep over books, and leave mankind unknown,</L>
<L>To praise each senior blockhead's thread-bare tale,</L>
<L>And laugh till reason blush, and spirits fail,</L>
<L>Manhood with vile submission to disgrace,</L>
<L>And <HI>cap</HI> the fool, whose merit is his Place;</L>
<L>VICE CHANCELLORS, whose knowledge is but small,</L>
<L>And CHANCELLORS, who nothing know at all,</L>
<L>Ill-brook'd the gen'rous Spirit, in those days</L>
<L>When Learning was the certain road to praise,</L>
<L>When Nobles, with a love of Science bless'd,</L>
<L>Approv'd in others what themselves possess'd.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
<L>But <HI>Now,</HI> when DULLNESS rears aloft her throne,</L>
<L>When LORDLY Vassals her wide Empire own,</L>
<L>When Wit, seduc'd by Envy, starts aside,</L>
<L>And basely leagues with Ignorance and Pride,</L>
<L>What <HI>Now</HI> should tempt us, by false hopes misled,</L>
<L>Learning's unfashionable paths to tread;</L>
<L>To bear those labours, which our Fathers bore</L>
<L>That Crown with-held, which They in triumph wore?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When with much pains this boasted Learning's got,</L>
<L>'Tis an affront to those who have it not.</L>
<L>In some it causes hate, in others fear,</L>
<L>Instructs our Foes to rail, our Friends to sneer.</L>
<L>With prudent haste the worldly-minded fool,</L>
<L>Forgets the little which he learn'd at School;</L>
<L>The Elder Brother, to vast fortunes born,</L>
<L>Looks on all Science with an Eye of Scorn;</L>
<L>Dependent Breth'ren the same features wear,</L>
<L>And younger Sons are stupid as the Heir.</L>
<L>In Senates, at the Bar, in Church and State,</L>
<L>Genius is vile, and Learning out of date.</L>
<L>Is this—O Death to think! is this the Land</L>
<L>Where Merit and Reward went hand in hand,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Where Heroes, Parent-like, the Poet view'd?—</L>
<L>By whom they saw their glorious deeds renew'd;</L>
<L>Where Poets, true to Honour, tun'd their lays,</L>
<L>And by their Patrons sanctify'd their praise?</L>
<L>Is this the Land, where, on our SPENCER'S tongue,</L>
<L>Enamour'd of his voice, Description hung;</L>
<L>Where JOHNSON rigid gravity beguil'd,</L>
<L>Whilst Reason thro' her Critic fences smil'd;</L>
<L>Where NATURE list'ning stood, whilst SHAKESPEAR play'd,</L>
<L>And wonder'd at the Work herself had made?</L>
<L>Is this the Land, where, mindful of her charge</L>
<L>And Office high, fair Freedom walk'd at large;</L>
<L>Where, finding in our Laws a sure defence,</L>
<L>She mock'd at all restraints, but those of Sense;</L>
<L>Where, health and honour trooping by her side,</L>
<L>She spread her sacred empire far and wide;</L>
<L>Pointed the Way, Affliction to beguile,</L>
<L>And bade the Face of Sorrow wear a smile,</L>
<L>Bade those, who dare obey the gen'rous call,</L>
<L>Enjoy her blessings, which GOD meant for all?</L>
<L>Is this the Land, where, in some Tyrant's reign,</L>
<L>When a <HI>weak, wicked Ministerial</HI> train,</L>
<L>The tools of pow'r, the slaves of int'rest, plann'd</L>
<L>Their Country's ruin, and with bribes unman'd</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Those wretches, who, ordain'd in Freedom's cause,</L>
<L>Gave up our liberties, and sold our laws;</L>
<L>When Pow'r was taught by Meanness where to go,</L>
<L>Nor dar'd to love the Virtue of a foe;</L>
<L>When, like a lep'rous plague, from the foul head</L>
<L>To the foul heart her sores Corruption spread,</L>
<L>Her iron arm when stern Oppression rear'd,</L>
<L>And Virtue, from her broad base shaken, fear'd</L>
<L>The scourge of Vice; when, impotent and vain,</L>
<L>Poor Freedom bow'd the neck to Slav'ry's chain;</L>
<L>Is this the Land, where, in those worst of times,</L>
<L>The hardy Poet rais'd his honest rimes</L>
<L>To dread rebuke, and bade controulment speak</L>
<L>In guilty blushes on the villain's cheek,</L>
<L>Bade Pow'r turn pale, kept mighty rogues in awe,</L>
<L>And made them fear the Muse, who fear'd not Law?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How do I laugh, when men of narrow souls,</L>
<L>Whom folly guides, and prejudice controuls;</L>
<L>Who, one dull drowsy track of business trod,</L>
<L>Worship their Mammon, and neglect their God;</L>
<L>Who, breathing by one musty set of rules,</L>
<L>Dote from the birth, and are by system fools;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Who, form'd to dullness from their very youth,</L>
<L>Lies of the day prefer to Gospel truth,</L>
<L>Pick up their little knowledge from Reviews,</L>
<L>And lay out all their stock of faith in news:</L>
<L>How do I laugh, when Creatures, form'd like these,</L>
<L>Whom Reason scorns, and I should blush to please,</L>
<L>Rail at all lib'ral arts, deem verse a crime,</L>
<L>And hold not Truth, as Truth, if told in rime?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How do I laugh, when PUBLIUS, hoary grown</L>
<L>In zeal for SCOTLAND'S wellfare, and his own,</L>
<L>By slow degrees, and course of office, drawn</L>
<L>In mood and figure at the helm to yawn,</L>
<L>Too mean (the worst of curses Heav'n can send)</L>
<L>To have a foe, too proud to have a friend,</L>
<L>Erring by form, which Blockheads sacred hold,</L>
<L>Ne'er making new faults, and ne'er mending old,</L>
<L>Rebukes my Spirit, bids the daring Muse</L>
<L>Subjects more equal to her weakness chuse;</L>
<L>Bids her frequent the haunts of humble swains,</L>
<L>Nor dare to traffick in ambitious strains;</L>
<L>Bids her, indulging the poetic whim</L>
<L>In quaint-wrought Ode, or Sonnet pertly trim,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Along the Church-way path complain with GRAY,</L>
<L>Or dance with MASON on the first of May?</L>
<L>"All sacred is the name and pow'r of Kings,</L>
<L>"All States and Statesmen are those mighty Things</L>
<L>"Which, howsoe'er they out of course may roll,</L>
<L>"Were never made for Poets to controul."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Peace, Peace thou Dotard, nor thus vilely deem</L>
<L>Of Sacred Numbers, and their pow'r blaspheme;</L>
<L>I tell thee, Wretch, search all Creation round,</L>
<L>In Earth, in Heav'n, no Subject can be found</L>
<L>(Our God alone except) above whose weight</L>
<L>The Poet cannot rise, and hold his State.</L>
<L>The blessed Saints above in numbers speak</L>
<L>The praise of God, tho' there all praise is weak;</L>
<L>In Numbers here below the Bard shall teach</L>
<L>Virtue to soar beyond the Villain's reach;</L>
<L>Shall tear his lab'ring lungs, strain his hoarse throat,</L>
<L>And raise his voice beyond the trumpet's note,</L>
<L>Should an afflicted Country, aw'd by men</L>
<L>Of slavish principles, demand his pen.</L>
<L>This is a great, a glorious point of view,</L>
<L>Fit for an English Poet to pursue,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Undaunted to pursue, tho', in return,</L>
<L>His writings by the common Hangman burn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How do I laugh, when men, by fortune plac'd</L>
<L>Above their Betters, and by rank disgrac'd,</L>
<L>Who found their pride on titles which they stain,</L>
<L>And, mean themselves, are of their Fathers vain,</L>
<L>Who would a bill of privilege prefer,</L>
<L>And treat a Poet, like a Creditor,</L>
<L>The gen'rous ardour of the Muse condemn,</L>
<L>And curse the storm they know must break on them?</L>
<L>"What, shall a reptile Bard, a wretch unknown,</L>
<L>"Without one badge of merit, but his own,</L>
<L>"Great Nobles lash, and <HI>Lords,</HI> like common men,</L>
<L>"Smart from the vengeance of a Scribbler's pen?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What's in this name of <HI>Lord,</HI> that we should fear</L>
<L>To bring their vices to the public ear?</L>
<L>Flows not the honest blood of humble swains</L>
<L>Quick as the tide which swells a Monarch's veins?</L>
<L>Monarchs, who wealth and titles can bestow,</L>
<L>Cannot make Virtues in succession flow.</L>
<L>Would'st Thou, Proud Man, be safely plac'd above</L>
<L>The censure of the Muse, deserve her Love,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Act as thy Birth demands, as Nobles ought;</L>
<L>Look back, and by thy worthy Father taught,</L>
<L>Who <HI>earn'd</HI> those Honours, Thou wert <HI>born</HI> to wear,</L>
<L>Follow his steps, and be his Virtue's heir.</L>
<L>But if, regardless of the road to Fame,</L>
<L>You start aside, and tread the paths of shame.</L>
<L>If such thy life, that should thy Sire arise,</L>
<L>The sight of such a Son would blast his eyes,</L>
<L>Would make him curse the hour which gave Thee birth,</L>
<L>Would drive him, shudd'ring, from the face of earth</L>
<L>Once more, with shame and sorrow, 'mongst the dead</L>
<L>In endless night to hide his rev'rend head;</L>
<L>If such thy life, tho' Kings had made thee more</L>
<L>Than ever King a scoundrel made before,</L>
<L>Nay, to allow thy pride a deeper spring,</L>
<L>Tho' God in vengeance had made Thee a King,</L>
<L>Taking on Virtue's wing her daring flight,</L>
<L>The Muse should drag thee trembling to the light,</L>
<L>Probe thy foul wounds, and lay thy bosom bare</L>
<L>To the keen question of the searching air.</L>

<L>Gods! with what pride I see the titled slave,</L>

Aiming at ease, and with dishonest art</L>
<L>Striving to hide the feelings of his heart!</L>
<L>How do I laugh, when, with affected air,</L>
<L>(Scarce able thro' despite to keep his chair,</L>
<L>Whilst on his trembling lip pale anger speaks,</L>
<L>And the chaf'd blood flies mounting to his cheeks)</L>
<L>He talks of Conscience, which good men secures</L>
<L>From all those evil moments guilt endures,</L>
<L>And seems to laugh at those, who pay regard</L>
<L>To the wild ravings of a frantic bard.</L>
<L>"SATIRE, whilst envy and ill-humour sway</L>
<L>"The mind of man, must always make her way,</L>
<L>"Nor to a bosom, with discretion fraught,</L>

<L>"The Wise have not the will, nor Fools the pow'r</L>
<L>"To stop her headstrong course; within the hour,</L>
<L>"Left to herself, she dies; opposing Strife,</L>
<L>"Gives her fresh vigour, and prolongs her life.</L>
<L>"All things her prey, and ev'ry man her aim,</L>

<L>"Nor would I wish to stop that harmless dart</L>

<L>Lives there a Man, who calmly can stand by,</L>

Men the most infamous are fond of fame,</L>

<L>But whither runs my zeal, whose rapid force,</L>
<L>Turning the brain, bears Reason from her course,</L>
<L>Carries me back to times, when Poets, bless'd</L>
<L>With courage, grac'd the Science they profess'd;</L>
<L>When They, in Honour rooted, firmly stood</L>
<L>The bad to punish, and reward the good;</L>
<L>When, to a flame by Public Virtue wrought,</L>
<L>The foes of Feedom They to justice brought,</L>
<L>And dar'd expose those slaves, who dar'd support</L>
<L>A Tyrant plan, and call'd themselves a Court.</L>

<L>Who deal in Verse, as those who deal in Prose.</L>
<L>Is there an Author, search the Kingdom round,</L>

<L>Forbid it, Heav'n; or, should it turn out so,</L>
<L>Let Me, and Mine, continue mean and low.</L>

<L>We scorn Preferment which is gain'd by Sin,</L>
<L>And will, tho' poor without, have peace within.</L>
