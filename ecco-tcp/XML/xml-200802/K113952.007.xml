<LG>
<L>IN the full prospect yonder hill commands</L>
<L>O'er forests, fields, and vernal-coated plains;</L>
<L>The vestige of an antient abbey stands,</L>
<L>Close by a ruin'd castle's rude remains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Half buried, there, lie many a broken bust,</L>
<L>And obelisk, and urn, o'erthrown by Time;</L>
<L>And many a cherub, here, descends in dust</L>
<L>From the rent roof, and portico sublime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The rivulets, oft frighted at the sound</L>
<L>Of fragments tumbling from the towers on high,</L>
<L>Plunge to their source in secret caves profound,</L>
<L>Leaving their banks and pebbly bottoms dry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where reverend shrines in Gothic grandeur stood,</L>
<L>The nettle, or the noxious night-shade, spreads;</L>
<L>And ashlings, wafted from the neighbouring wood,</L>
<L>Thro' the worn turrets wave their trembling heads.</L>

<L>There Contemplation, to the crowd unknown,</L>
<L>Her attitude compos'd, and aspect sweet!</L>
<L>Sits musing on a monumental stone,</L>
<L>And points to the Memento at her feet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as sage evening check'd day's sunny pride,</L>
<L>I left the mantling shade, in moral mood;</L>

<L>Thus sigh'd, the mouldering ruins as I view'd.</L>

<L>Inexorably calm, with silent pace,</L>
<L>Here Time has pass'd—What ruin marks his way!</L>
<L>This pile, now crumbling o'er its hallow'd base,</L>
<L>Turn'd not his step, nor could his course delay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Religion rais'd her supplicating eyes</L>
<L>In vain; and Melody, her song sublime:</L>
<L>In vain, Philosophy, with maxims wise,</L>
<L>Would touch the cold unfeeling heart of Time.</L>
</LG>

<L>Yet the hoar tyrant, tho' not mov'd to spare,</L>
<L>Relented when he struck its finish'd pride;</L>
<L>And, partly the rude ravage to repair,</L>
<L>The tottering towers with twisted ivy tied.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How solemn is the cell o'ergrown with moss,</L>
<L>That terminates the view yon cloister'd way!</L>
<L>In the crush'd wall a time-corroded cross,</L>

<L>Near the brown arch, redoubling yonder gloom,</L>

<L>Tho' deem'd invincible, the conqueror, Time,</L>

<L>Can the deep statesman, skill'd in great design,</L>

<L>Shall mourn his error, and, repenting, own,</L>

<L>By Love inspir'd, the birds their amorous tales</L>

<HEAD>ANNINGAIT AND AJUTT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LOve, powerful Love, each being can controul,</L>
<L>Brighten the mind, and animate the soul:</L>
<L>Love can, with truth, the mighty magic boast,</L>
<L>Of sacred warmth amidst eternal frost;</L>
<L>Witness fair Ajutt, pride of icy plains,</L>
<L>Where darkness half the year triumphant reigns,</L>
<L>And faithful, generous Anningait, the youth,</L>
<L>By Love taught softness, by that softness truth:</L>
<L>Both flourish'd sweet on Greenland's rigid coast,</L>
<L>Pure as their snow, and constant as their frost;</L>
<L>No polish'd arts of specious vice they knew,</L>
<L>The youth was noble, and the maid was true;</L>
<L>From earliest dawn their charms no rival saw,</L>
<L>By nature blest beyond her usual law;</L>
<L>No Greenland swain like Anningait could dare,</L>
<L>To fix th' harpoon, or rouse the whale to war;</L>
<L>From his firm hand the unerring javelin flew,</L>
<L>His bark sure loaded by the seal he slew;</L>
<L>Blest in his friends, illustrious was his race,</L>
<L>Grac'd by his birth, his birth his actions grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas at a solemn feast in Greenland held,</L>
<L>Where beauteous Ajutt every nymph excell'd,</L>
<L>That Anningait first saw the blooming fair,</L>
<L>With modest sense, and unaffected air;</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="85"/>He gaz'd with rapture! Ajutt did the same!</L>
<L>Their souls, congenial, caught the rising flame;</L>
<L>On her alone he fix'd his firm regard,</L>
<L>The choicest whale was to her board preferr'd;</L>
<L>A spotless ermine (emblem of her mind)</L>
<L>To deck her shoulders he from his resign'd;</L>
<L>With these a gift of greater prize bestow'd,</L>
<L>A heart all her's, a heart supremely good:</L>
<L>To sing her charms his artless voice was fir'd,</L>
<L>Hence flow'd the lay which love and she inspir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' Ajutt, more beauteous than the willow's shade,</L>
<L>' Fragrant as mountain-thyme, inchanting maid,</L>
<L>' Whose taper fingers white and polish'd are,</L>
<L>' As morse's teeth, and nimble as the hare;</L>
<L>' Thy smiles as grateful as dissolving snow,</L>
<L>' When welcome sunshine bids our lakes to flow;</L>
<L>' Far as e'er thought can trace I'd thee pursue,</L>
<L>' And be thy guardian and thy lover too;</L>
<L>' No power shall Ajutt from her love divide,</L>
<L>' Nor midland cliffs, nor eastern caverns hide;</L>
<L>' Not the malignant genius of the rock,</L>
<L>' Our foe avow'd, rapacious Amarock,</L>
<L>' Should from my faithful arm my Ajutt tear,</L>
<L>' That arm unwearied should protect my fair;</L>
<L>' Even Haffgufa, the fear of every maid,</L>
<L>' I'd dauntless meet, nor once his prowess dread;</L>
<L>' Be kind then, Ajutt, and my passion try,</L>
<L>' Who lives but in thy smile, without thy smile must die;</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="86"/>' And may that wretch, if such a wretch there be,</L>
<L>' Who blasts our union, or dare envy me,</L>
<L>' Be in his icy bed for ever laid,</L>
<L>' Without his bow, nor wept by faithful maid;</L>
<L>' And in the laud of souls, when he arrives,</L>
<L>' And new to life in that dread clime revives,</L>
<L>' May then his scull the burning drops receive</L>
<L>' From starry lamps, nor other gift relieve;</L>
<L>' For sure, by fate, fair Ajutt must be mine,</L>
<L>' Pure is my passion, and my flame divine.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' attentive fishers, Greenland's choicest swains,</L>
<L>Enraptur'd, listen and approve his strains;</L>
<L>The nymphs on Ajutt cast an envious eye,</L>
<L>And wish their fate with such a swain to try;</L>
<L>While she, tho' pleas'd, conceals the soft regard,</L>
<L>And beauty's power exerts to be the more rever'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now, long absent Sol, the god of day,</L>
<L>Began his beams on sparkling frost to play;</L>
<L>The snow dissolves, long stagnant waters rise,</L>
<L>A new creation seems to greet their eyes;</L>
<L>The Greenland youths the happy omen hail,</L>
<L>Prepare for combat with the mighty whale;</L>
<L>With active ardor all renew their toil,</L>
<L>And count in thought the treasures of their oil;</L>
<L>Foremost in all see Anningait appear,</L>
<L>For lovely Ajutt deigns the toil to share;</L>
<L>Her presence animates the hero's mind,</L>
<L>He rush'd on danger fleeter than the wind;</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="87"/>With agile arm th' astonish'd sea-horse struck,</L>
<L>And drew him, panting, on his well-fix'd hook;</L>
<L>In utmost depths the diving seal pursued,</L>
<L>And pierc'd th' emerging whale, with sinewy strength endued;</L>
<L>And when, with loaded bark, to land they steer,</L>
<L>With active skill he caught the dappled deer;</L>
<L>Their glossy skins he drest to deck his bride,</L>
<L>But hope and anxious fear his breast divide;</L>
<L>For still fair Ajutt further proof demands,</L>
<L>Ere-nuptial rites should join their plighted hands;</L>
<L>To distant shores commands the youth to rove,</L>
<L>To find if absence could abate his love;</L>
<L>Bad him in search of wandering whales to roam,</L>
<L>To crown their board when winter call'd him home;</L>
<L>He must comply—implicit he obeys,</L>
<L>Her will his law—what more a lover sways?—</L>
<L>Yet, ere he went, her tent with flowers he strews,</L>
<L>Refresh'd with sweetest of the Iceland dews;</L>
<L>Balmy as Ajutt's breath, the new-born flowers</L>
<L>Might boast of fragrance with Arcadian bowers;</L>
<L>These as he strew'd, to Ajutt thus he said,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' Attend—and mark—inexorable maid:</L>
<L>' See in these blossoms beauty's short-liv'd power,</L>
<L>' Beauty as fading as the morning flower;</L>
<L>' This hour presents them lovely to thy view,</L>
<L>' Impearl'd with fragrance, deck'd in orient dew;</L>
<L>' Another comes, no more they cheer thine eye,</L>
<L>' And ere a third revolves, they droop and die;</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="88"/>' Such, my lov'd Ajutt, is the life we boast,</L>
<L>' A transient dream which ere enjoy'd is lost:</L>
<L>' Why wilt thou then enforce thy harsh command,</L>
<L>' And drive me wretched to the distant strand?</L>
<L>' Why wilt thou not my plighted vow receive,</L>
<L>' And be my partner on the boisterous wave?</L>
<L>' Then could I fearless every danger try,</L>
<L>' What danger can I dread when Ajutt's by?</L>
<L>' O! virgin, beauteous as the sunny beam,</L>
<L>' Which glittering dances on the limpid stream,</L>
<L>' Once more reflect—recall the sad decree,</L>
<L>' Be just to Ajutt, and be kind to me;</L>
<L>' Think, ere I go, what frosts, what fogs may rise,</L>
<L>' And, join'd, preclude thy presence from my eyes;</L>
<L>' Thou know'st, my fair, our clime, condemn'd to frost,</L>
<L>' Of days and nights alternate cannot boast,</L>
<L>' Like those gay climes by lying strangers told,</L>
<L>' Where houses screen them from inclement cold;</L>
<L>' Ere my return dread winter's bird may sing,</L>
<L>' And night o'ertake me with an eagle's wing;</L>
<L>' What then in those lone months can cheer my soul?</L>
<L>' Not seal, delicious, nor the flowing bowl;</L>
<L>' The flaming lamps without thy eyes would fade,</L>
<L>' Nor healing oil could cure the wound they made.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain the youth his utmost art essay'd,</L>
<L>Persuasion mov'd not, nor soft pity sway'd,</L>
<L>Perversly fix'd, he found the cruel maid:</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="89"/>But ere he went, his last respect to show,</L>
<L>Seven ermine skins, that rival'd Greenland's snow,</L>
<L>With five fair swans, he as a tribute gave,</L>
<L>And seals fresh bleeding from the briny wave,</L>
<L>With marble lamps, and oil of curious taste,</L>
<L>To deck her board, and crown the rich repast:</L>
<L>With joy refin'd, this gift the nymph receiv'd,</L>
<L>As proof of love, from him in whom she liv'd;</L>
<L>Then trembling wish'd the parting pang was o'er,</L>
<L>While pitying sighs her love-lorn basom tore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The ready boat the tardy youth upbraids,</L>
<L>And frequent summons from the rowing maids—</L>
<L>' I come, he cries—my Ajutt lov'd adieu—</L>
<L>' Forget me not, my fair,—be just—be true.'</L>
<L>The words, by grief, half frozen on his tongue,</L>
<L>He sigh'd—she wept—and on his bosom hung;</L>
<L>Then vow'd unchanging love, and fervent pray'd</L>
<L>The powers to guard him for his faithful maid;</L>
<L>And that no mermaid, syren of the deep,</L>
<L>Might snatch her love, or give her cause to weep;</L>
<L>With sorrow, tender as the constant dove,</L>
<L>Who mourns the tedious absence of her love,</L>
<L>Did Anningait his lovely Ajutt leave,</L>
<L>And from her wish his only joy receive:</L>
<L>With her's, his own he joins, and prays each power,</L>
<L>To guard his maid, and hasle their nuptial hour;</L>
<L>Then onward moves—now looks a last adieu,</L>
<L>While tender eloquence his cheeks bedew;</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="90"/>Thrice he attempts his floating bark to leave,</L>
<L>And swim to Ajutt o'er the dashing wave;</L>
<L>Like some fair image Ajutt lifeless stands,</L>
<L>Surveys his boat, and marks the printed sands;</L>
<L>Till waves and rocks her prospect intercept,</L>
<L>Her hut then sought, and there in private wept;</L>
<L>But, rous'd by hope of Anningait's return,</L>
<L>Each female art she tries in various turn;</L>
<L>One hour the greenest moss she culls with care,</L>
<L>And dries the grass for Anningait to wear;</L>
<L>Of softest skins a fishing coat she wrought,</L>
<L>Of curious form, like him of whom she thought;</L>
<L>A boat of toughest skins together sew'd,</L>
<L>And as she work'd each tender vow renew'd;</L>
<L>Then in soft numbers each good genius prays,</L>
<L>To guide her swain thro' Terror's pathless ways;</L>
<L>And that his nervous arms might stronger prove,</L>
<L>Than the fierce bear, nor aught annoy her love;</L>
<L>That his swift darts unerring he might guide,</L>
<L>That his tough boat might bravely stem the tide;</L>
<L>That the crack'd ice might ne'er his feet betray,</L>
<L>Nor his harpoon might ever fail the prey.</L>
<L>Thus in lone sadness Ajutt still remains,</L>
<L>Nor joins the maidens on the jocund plains;</L>
<L>Her locks unbraided o'er her shoulders flow,</L>
<L>In beauteous negligence, and pomp of woe;</L>
<L>Their rural sports she now no more adorns,</L>
<L>Nor thinks of joy till Anningait returns;</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="91"/>While he, by calms detain'd, or tempest tost,</L>
<L>Vainly attemps to reach the destin'd coast,</L>
<L>Banish'd from Ajutt all his joys are lost,</L>
<L>Sighing he stands, and views the ruffled main,</L>
<L>And thus to life compares the varied scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' O! frail, uncertain state, where shall we find</L>
<L>' A truer emblem of the human mind,</L>
<L>' Than in the floating ice, by billows tost,</L>
<L>' It towers on high, there sparkles and is lost;</L>
<L>' The sun-beams, bright, dissolve the glittering toy,</L>
<L>' And rocks, below, their hidden power employ;</L>
<L>' Each cause concurs this certain truth to prove,</L>
<L>' No joys are permanent but those above:</L>
<L>' What art thou, Pleasure! fleeting as a dream!</L>
<L>' Which sudden blazes like a northern gleam,</L>
<L>' That plays a moment on our dazled eyes,</L>
<L>' Then palls, and fades, and in an instant dies:</L>
<L>' What art thou Love! the whirlpool of our rest!</L>
<L>' The fatal eddy of the human breast;</L>
<L>' The soft sensation, that unseen obtains</L>
<L>' Such sovereign sway, soon absolute it reigns:</L>
<L>' Had not my eyes thy charms, O Ajutt! trac'd,</L>
<L>' The sweet expressions that thy person grac'd;</L>
<L>' The winning softness, and th' attracting mien,</L>
<L>' Which conscious spoke the Graces dwelt within,</L>
<L>' Then had I still with downy ease been blest,</L>
<L>' Slept like the careless morse in vacant rest,</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="92"/>' Joyous as minstrels in the starry sphere,</L>
<L>' Had felt no grief, a stranger still to care:</L>
<L>' But, if my lovely fair will true remain,</L>
<L>' How light each toil, and overpaid each pain;</L>
<L>' That sweet reflection shall my peace restore,</L>
<L>' She's just as fair, and we shall part no more:</L>
<L>' That thought, my Ajutt, shall my nerves new-brace,</L>
<L>' I'll hunt the raindeer to the utmost chace;</L>
<L>' A few weeks past, then loaded I'll return,</L>
<L>' And Love's pure flame for us shall grateful burn;</L>
<L>' Roefish and porpoise shall thy kindred feast,</L>
<L>' And thou shalt smile on every friendly guest;</L>
<L>' The fox and hare shall Ajutt's couch enfold,</L>
<L>' And seals tough skins shall screen thee from the cold;</L>
<L>' The marble lamps with sweetest oil I'll fill,</L>
<L>' To light thy tent, and fragrant fumes distill;</L>
<L>' Haste then, O time! add swiftness to thy flight,</L>
<L>' For, without Ajutt, horrid were the night.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus was the youth alternate captive led,</L>
<L>By smiling Hope, Dismay, and anxious Dread;</L>
<L>Till rous'd by spouting whales his ardour glows,</L>
<L>He with new courage to the combat goes;</L>
<L>Ajutt, a sweet recluse from all she lov'd,</L>

<L><PB N="91" REF="93"/>Nornsuck, a mighty chief among their swains,</L>

<L>And falls a victim to her conquering eyes;</L>
<L>Fair without gaudy pomp, or studied art,</L>
<L>Her native beauty struck the hero's heart;</L>
<L>By Love o'er-awed, whose power he now first knew,</L>
<L>Speechless he gaz'd, and wist not what to do;</L>
<L>But ready Hope her healing succour sends,</L>
<L>And bids him gain the fair-one by her friends;</L>
<L>For much he fear'd his suit to Ajutt vain,</L>
<L>Yet bless'd the absence of her favour'd swain;</L>
<L>Revolves with joy his birth and mighty store,</L>
<L>For great his wealth, no Greenland swain had more;</L>
<L>With these resolves her parents faith to try,</L>

<L>Yet first presumes his passion to disclose,</L>

<L>Her father's distant hutt he instant sought,</L>
<L>His worth explain'd, and every tender thought,</L>
<L>Which soon their sordid minds to his opinion wrought.</L>
<L>Home when the maid returns, with artful tale,</L>
<L>They praise young Nornsuck, hero of the vale;</L>
<L>His power, his wealth, they set in dazzling light,</L>
<L>His vast possessions for th' approaching night;</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="94"/>How bright his form (for true the youth was fair)</L>
<L>In graceful ringlets flow'd his jetty hair,</L>
<L>His person pleasing, and quick piercing eye,</L>
<L>That might for brightness with the eagle's vie;</L>
<L>His ardent passion crown'd the irksome tale,</L>
<L>But vain each art that dar'd her truth assail;</L>
<L>With silent scorn th' amazing change she hears,</L>
<L>That they forget her vow and daily tears;</L>
<L>At last, long urg'd, she painful silence broke,</L>
<L>And thus her sentiments in anguish spoke:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' Sooner shall whales their liquid world forsake,</L>
<L>' And seek for pastime in the half froze lake;</L>
<L>' Sooner shall endless night o'er Greenland reign,</L>
<L>' And cheering sun-shine never gild the plain,</L>
<L>' Than I in thought or word my love forego,</L>
<L>' Fix'd as my native frost, unblemish'd as my snow.'</L>
<L>Then swift as bounding hart away she fled,</L>
<L>And travers'd hill or dale as fancy led;</L>
<L>Firmly resolv'd the hutt to see no more,</L>
<L>Till Anningait arriv'd on Greenland's shore;</L>
<L>A willing exile from her father's board,</L>
<L>Her wants supplied from Nature's varied hoard;</L>
<L>She oft high cliffs ascends, and eager eyes</L>
<L>The distant main in curling billows rise;</L>
<L>Each time new hope her anxious bosom cheers,</L>
<L>Nay more than hope, for now the boat appears;</L>
<L><PB N="93" REF="95"/>The wish'd for bark in loaded pomp returns,</L>
<L>Wild with the joy no longer now she mourns,</L>
<L>But darts with rapid ease o'er hill and dale,</L>
<L>Now scours the plain, or skims along the vale;</L>
<L>Till faint with joy she gains the pebbled shore,</L>
<L>And hails the bark, and hears the dashing oar;</L>
<L>Then with loud rapture calls her destin'd mate,</L>
<L>Her life, her lord, her much-lov'd Anningait;</L>
<L>But the glad sounds no Anningait repays,</L>
<L>Trembling she wonders at th' unkind delays;</L>
<L>Eager the cruel reason she demands,</L>

<L>Aghast they gaze, as Anningait she calls,</L>

<HEAD>A THOUGHT IN A GARDEN.</HEAD>
<L>REclin'd I lay, where thro' my garden glides</L>
<L>The smooth canal, and laves its verdant sides,</L>
<L>While, vex'd with secret melancholy pain,</L>
<L>Thus to the glittering mirror I complain:</L>
<L>" Why, envied stream, when you so clearly shine,</L>
<L>" Smiles not my bosom as serene as thine?</L>
<L>" O whisper, gliding to my anxious breast,</L>
<L>" Why sighs it thus, and wishes to be blest?"</L>
<L>Still pensive I complain'd; th' unanswering stream</L>
<L>Still tinkled on, and lull'd me to a dream:</L>
<L>There I beheld a beauteous nymph arise,</L>
<L>Smiling her looks, and languishing her eyes;</L>
<L>Startled I know my Parthenissa's air,</L>
<L>And fly enraptur'd to the promis'd fair.</L>
<L>So in the new-created Eden plac'd,</L>
<L>With all th' Almighty's lavish bounty grac'd,</L>
<L>God saw the solitary Adam grieve,</L>

<LG>
<L>When thus I buz'd: when tyme no sap would give,</L>
<L>Why then is blessed tyme to me soe drye?</L>
<L>Sith in this tyme the lazie droane doth live,</L>
<L>The waspe, the worme, the gnat, and butterflie;</L>
<L>Mated with greeffe, I kneeled on my knees,</L>

<L>My leege, God grant thy tyme may never end,</L>
<L>And yet vowesafe to heare my plainte of tyme,</L>
<L>Which every fruitles flie hath found a friend,</L>
<L>And I cast downe wheare attomies doe clime,</L>
<L>The king replyed but thus;—"peace, peaving bee,</L>
<L>" Thou'rt borne to serve the tyme, the tyme not thee."</L>

<L>The tyme not thee? this word clipt shorte my winges,</L>

<L>I woorke on meedes, the moone was in the waine,</L>
<L>Whilst all the swarme in sunshine taste the rose,</L>

<L>Are bees waxt waspes, or spiders to infect?</L>

<L>There's one that fretteth in the highest degree</L>
<L>To see some caterbillers, bred of late,</L>
<L>Cropping the fruites that should sustaine the bee;</L>

<HEAD>ODE FOR HIS MAJESTY'S BIRTH-DAY, JUNE IV, MDCCLXIII.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>COmmon births, like common things,</L>
<L>Pass unheeded, or unknown;</L>
<L>Time but spreads, or waves his wings,</L>
<L>The phantom swells, the phantom's gone!</L>
<L>Born for millions monarchs rise,</L>
<L>Heirs of infamy or fame:</L>
<L>When the virtuous, brave, or wise,</L>
<L>Demand our praise, with loud acclaim,</L>
<L>We twine the festive wreath, the shrines adorn,</L>
<L>'Tis not our king's alone, 'tis Britain's natal morn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bright examples, plac'd on high,</L>
<L>Shine with more distinguish'd blaze;</L>
<L>Thither nations turn their eye,</L>
<L>And grow virtuous as they gaze.</L>
<L>Thoughtless ease and sportive leisure</L>
<L>Dwell in life's contracted sphere,</L>
<L>Public is the monarch's pleasure,</L>
<L>Public is the monarch's care:</L>
<L>If Titus smiles the observant world is gay,</L>
<L>If Titus frowns or sighs, we sigh and lose a day!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
<L>Around their couch, around their board</L>
<L>A thousand ears attentive wait,</L>
<L>A thousand busy tongues record</L>
<L>The smallest whispers of the great.</L>
<L>Happy those whom Truth sincere</L>
<L>And conscious Virtue join to guide!</L>
<L>Can they have a foe to fear?</L>
<L>Can they have a thought to hide?</L>
<L>Nobly they soar above th' admiring throng,</L>
<L>Superior to the power, the will of acting wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such may Britain find her kings!—</L>
<L>Such the Muse of rapid wings</L>
<L>Wafts to some sublimer sphere:</L>
<L>Gods and heroes mingle there.</L>
<L>Fame's eternal accents breath,</L>
<L>Black Cocytus howls beneath:</L>
<L>Ev'n Malice learns to blush, and hide her stings:</L>
<L>—O such may Britain ever find her kings!</L>

<HEAD>A SONG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHen a nymph at her toilet has spent the whole day,</L>
<L>To shine in brocade at a ball or the play,</L>
<L>Her rival the butterfly, vain to excess,</L>
<L>May be justly more proud, if there's merit in dress.</L>
<L>The purple and gold, in his plumage display'd,</L>
<L>Than velvet's more soft, and more gay than brocade.</L>
<L>But, with all this advantage of dress, you may see</L>
<L>That the butterfly still is less lov'd than the bee:</L>
<L>For the bee, tho' he shines with no purple and gold,</L>
<L>We provide a good lodging to fence from the cold;</L>
<L>For his honey we love him, altho' he will sting,</L>
<L>And despise the gay insects that flutter and sing:</L>
<L>And hence the coquet this plain lesson may find,</L>
<L>" That the useful alone are the lov'd of mankind."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let the foolish and vain at the toilet still vie</L>
<L>In a fruitless endeavour to rival a fly,</L>
<L>Which if they could do, like the fly, for a day,</L>
<L>By fools they'd be play'd with, and then thrown away.</L>
<L>Let me like the bee every moment improve,</L>
<L>And merit a love which no time shall remove.</L>
