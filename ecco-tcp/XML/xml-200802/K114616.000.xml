<HEAD><PB N="11" REF="8"/>PART I. A DELINEATION OF The RULING MANNERS and PRINCIPLES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. THE DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>SUPERFICIAL, though zealous, Observers, think they see the Source of all our public Miscarriages in the parti∣cular and accidental Misconduct of Indivi∣duals. This is not much to be wondered at, because it is so easy a Solution.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="9"/>
THIS pretence, too, is plausibly urged upon the People by profligate Scribblers, who find their Account in it. It is a sort of Compliment paid the Public, to persuade them, that they have no Share in the Pro∣duction of these national Misfortunes.</P>
<P>BUT a candid and mature Consideration will convince us, that the Malady lies deeper than what is commonly suspected: and, on impartial Enquiry, it will pro∣bably be found springing, not from vary∣ing and incidental, but from permanent and established Causes.</P>
<P>IT is the observation of the greatest of political Writers, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is by no means Fortune that rules the World: for this we may appeal to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who had a long Series of Prosperities, when they acted upon a certain Plan; and an
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
uninterrupted Course of Misfortunes, when they conducted themselves upon another. There are general Causes, na∣tural or moral, which operate in every State; which raise, support, or overturn it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="margQuotes">"Ce n'est pas la Fortune qui domine le Monde: on peut le demander aux Romains, qui eurent une suite continuelle des Prosperités quand ils se gou∣vernerent sur un certain Plan, &amp; une suite non in∣terrompue de revers lors qu'ils se conduisirent sur un autre. Il y a des Causes generales, soit morales, soit physiques, qui agissent dans chaque Monarchie, l'elevent, la maintiennent, ou la precipitent."</Q> <BIBL><HI>Grandeur,</HI> &amp;c, <HI>des Romains,</HI> c. 18.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>AMONG all these various Causes, none perhaps so much contributes to raise or sink a Nation, as the Manners and Principles of its People. But as there never was any declining Nation, which had not Causes of Declension peculiar to itself, so it will re∣quire a minute Investigation into the lead∣ing
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
Manners and Principles of the present Times, to throw a just Light on the pecu∣liar Causes of our calamitous Situation.</P>
<P>To delineate these Manners and Princi∣ples without Aggravation or Weakness, to unravel their Effects on the public State and Welfare, and to trace them to their real though distant Sources, is indeed a Task of equal Difficulty and Importance.</P>
<P>IT may be necessary therefore to apolo∣gise even for the Attempt: as being sup∣posed to lie beyond the Sphere of him who makes it. To this it can only be replied, that a common Eye may <HI>possibly</HI> discover a lurking Rock or Sand, while the able and experienced Mariners overlook the Danger, through their Attention to the Helm, the Sails, or Rigging.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="12"/>
HE will be much mistaken, who expects to find here a Vein of undistinguishing and licentious Satire. To rail at the Times at large, can serve no good Purpose; and ge∣nerally ariseth from a Want of Knowledge or a Want of Honesty. There never was an Age or Nation that had not Virtues and Vices peculiar to itself: And in some Re∣spects, perhaps, there is no Time nor Country delivered down to us in Story, in which a wise Man would so much wish to have lived, as in our own.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this, our Situation seems most dangerous: We are rolling to the Brink of a Precipice that must destroy us.</P>
<P>AT such a Juncture, to hold up a true Mirroir to the Public, and let the Nation see <HI>themselves</HI> as the Authors of their own
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
Misfortunes, cannot be a very popular De∣sign. But as the Writer is not sollicitous about private Consequences, he can with the greater Security adopt the Words of an honest and sensible Man.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">"MOST commonly, such as palliate Evils, and represent the State of Things in a sounder Condition than truly they are, do thereby consult best for them∣selves, and better recommend their own Business and Pretensions in the World: But he who, to the utmost of his Skill and Power, speaks the Truth, where the Good of his King and Country are concerned, will be most esteemed by Persons of Virtue and Wisdom: And to the Favour and Protection of such, these Papers are committed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Davenant,</HI> on Trade.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>SECT. II. Of the Spirit of Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enumerate the concurrent Causes of our present Misfortunes and De∣cline; let us, by way of Contrast, muster the few remaining Virtues we have left; to which, in part, it is owing, that our Misfortunes are not heavier, and our De∣cline more rapid.</P>
<P>AMONG these, the first and most im∣portant, is the Spirit of Liberty. This, happily, still subsists among us: Not in∣deed in its genuine Vigour; for then, it would work its genuine effects. Yet, that the Love of Liberty is not extinguished, appears from the <HI>united Voice</HI> of a <HI>divided People.</HI> It still animates their Conversa∣tion, and invigorates their Addresses: tho'
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
in their Conduct it appears no more. But it is remarkable, that in Proportion as this Spirit hath grown weak in <HI>Deeds,</HI> it hath gained Strength in <HI>Words;</HI> and of late run out, into unbounded License.</P>
<P>THIS, however, appears beyond a Doubt: that we all wish to continue free; tho' we have not the Virtue to secure our Freedom. The Spirit of Liberty is now struggling with the <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Principles,</HI> as formerly it struggled with the <HI>Tyrants</HI> of the Time. But the Danger is now greater, because the Enemy is <HI>within;</HI> working secretly and securely, and destroy∣ing all those <HI>internal Powers,</HI> from which alone an effectual Opposition can arise.</P>
<P>WHEREVER this Spirit of Liberty sub∣sists in its full Vigour, the Vigilance and Power of impotent Governors are vain: A Nation can neither be surprised nor com∣pelled
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>
into Slavery: When this is extin∣guished, neither the Virtue nor Vigilance of Patriots can save it. In the Reign of JAMES the Second, <HI>Great Britain</HI> was free, tho' a despotic Prince was on the Throne: At the Time when CESAR fell, <HI>Rome</HI> was still inslaved, tho' the Tyrant was no more.</P>
<P>THIS great Spirit hath produced more full and complete Effects in our own Country, than in any known Nation that ever was upon Earth. It appears indeed, from a Concurrence of Facts too large to be produced here, that whereas it hath been ingrafted by the Arts of Policy in other Countries, it shoots up here as from its natu∣ral Climate, Stock, and Soil. From this Distinction, if laid in Nature, two or three Consequences will fairly arise. Its Ef∣fects must, of course, be more vigorous
<PB N="20" REF="17"/>
and full. It's Destruction, by external Violence, will probably be no more than temporary. It's chief Danger must arise from such Causes, as may poison the Root; or attack, and destroy the natural Spirit itself: These must be such Causes, as can steal upon, and subdue the <HI>Mind:</HI> that is, they must be <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"some Degene∣racy or Corruption of the Manners and Principles of the People."</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the Spirit of Humanity.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now trace the Spirit of Liberty through such of its Effects, as are not yet de∣stroyed by opposite Principles and Manners.</P>
<P>THE first that occurs, is <HI>Humanity.</HI> By this, is not meant that Smoothness and re∣fined Polish of external Manners, by which the present Age affects to be distinguished:
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
for this, it is apprehended, will belong to another Class. By <HI>Humanity,</HI> therefore, is meant, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Pity for Distress, that Mo∣deration in limiting Punishments by their proper Ends and Measures, by which this Nation hath always been distin∣guished."</Q></P>
<P>THE Lenity of our Laws in capital Ca∣ses; our Compassion for convicted Crimi∣nals; even the general Humanity of our Highwaymen and Robbers, compared with those of other Countries; these are concur∣rent Proofs, that the Spirit of Humanity is natural to our Nation.</P>
<P>THE many noble Foundations for the Relief of the Miserable and the Friendless; the large annual Supplies from voluntary Charities to these Foundations; the frequent and generous Assistance given to the Unfor∣tunate, who cannot be admitted into these
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
Foundations; all these are such indisputa∣ble Proofs of a national Humanity, as it were the highest Injustice not to acknow∣ledge and applaud.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the civil Administration of Justice.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER Virtue, and of the highest Consequence, as it regards the immediate and private Happiness of Individuals, yet left among us, is the pure Administration of Justice, as it regards private Property.</P>
<P>MANY Causes may be assigned, for the Continuance of this public Blessing. The Spirit of Liberty and Humanity beget a Spirit of Equity, where no contrary Passion interferes: The Spirit of Commerce, now predominant, begets a kind of regulated Selfishness, which tends at once to the In∣crease and Preservation of Property. The Difficulty of corrupting Juries under the
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>
Checks of their present Establishment, in most Cases prevents the very Attempt. And the long-continued Example of a great Person on the Seat of Equity, hath diffused an uncorrupt Spirit through the inferior Courts, and will shine to the latest Posterity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V. Of the Ruling Manners of the Times.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING made this prefatory Estimate of those remaining Manners which may demand Esteem and Applause, let us now proceed to the ruling Manners of the Times; from which this Age and Nation derives its present and particular Complex∣ion.</P>
<P>IT may be necessary to remark, that this designed Estimate extends not to the com∣parative Excellence of Manners and Prin∣ciples,
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>
considered in every View, and in all their Variety of near and remote Effects. It relates not to the immediate Happiness or Misery, which Individuals, Families, or Nations, may derive from the Force of prevailing Principles and Manners. These Effects branch out into an Infinity of in∣tricate Combinations, which cannot be comprehended in the present, but will make a material Part of some future En∣quiry. This Estimate, therefore, confines itself to such Consequences only, as affect the <HI>Duration</HI> of the <HI>public State:</HI> So that the leading Question will be, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How far the present ruling Manners and Principles of this Nation may tend to its Continu∣ance or Destruction."</Q></P>
<P>IN Consequence of this Restriction, the Manners and Principles of the common People will scarce find a Place in the Ac∣count. For though the Sum total of a Na∣tions
<PB N="25" REF="22"/>
immediate Happiness must arise, and be estimated, from the Manners and Prin∣ciples of the Whole; yet the Manners and Principles of those who <HI>lead,</HI> not of those who <HI>are led;</HI> of those who <HI>govern,</HI> not of those who <HI>are governed;</HI> of those, in short, who <HI>make</HI> Laws or <HI>execute</HI> them, will ever determine the Strength or Weakness, and therefore the Continuance or Dissolution, of a State.</P>
<P>FOR the blind Force or Weight of an ungoverned Multitude can have no steady nor rational Effect, unless some <HI>leading Mind</HI> rouse it into Action, and <HI>point</HI> it to it's proper <HI>End:</HI> without this, it is either a <HI>brute</HI> and random <HI>Bolt,</HI> or a <HI>lifeless Ball</HI> sleeping in the <HI>Cannon:</HI> It depends on some superior <HI>Intelligence,</HI> to give it both <HI>Impulse</HI> and <HI>Direction.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, were the <HI>People</HI> remarkably corrupt, they might properly make a Part
<PB N="26" REF="23"/>
of this Enquiry: But in most of those im∣portant Circumstances to which this Esti∣mate refers, they are in general much more irreproachable than their Superiors in Sta∣tion; especially, if we except the lower Ranks of those who live in great Towns. It will therefore be unnecessary to mark the Character of their Principles or Man∣ners, unless where they appear evidently poisoned by the Example or other Influence of the higher Ranks in Life.</P>
<P>Now the slighest Observation, if at∣tended with Impartiality, may convince us, that the Character of the Manners of this Age and Nation, is by no means that of <HI>abandoned Wickedness</HI> and <HI>Profligacy.</HI> This Degree of Degeneracy, indeed, is often imputed to the Times: But, to what Times hath it <HI>not</HI> been imputed? Present Objects are naturally magnified to the hu∣man
<PB N="27" REF="24"/>
Eye, while remote ones, though lar∣ger in Dimensions, vanish into nothing. Hence the Speculative and Virtuous, in every Age, confining their Views to their own Period, have been apt to aggravate its Manners into the highest Degree of Guilt; to <HI>satyrize,</HI> rather than <HI>describe;</HI> to throw their respective Times into one dark Shade of <HI>Horror,</HI> rather than mark their peculiar <HI>Colour</HI> and <HI>Complexion.</HI></P>
<P>HERE, a large Field of Comparison and Debate would open, were it necessary or even expedient to enter upon it. We might cast our Eye upon the Manners of ROME, CARTHAGE, and many other States, in their last declining Period; where we should behold such tragic Scenes of Cruelty, Impiety, and Oppression, as would confound the most sanguine Advocate for the Manners of Antiquity. But, in Truth,
<PB N="28" REF="25"/>
there can be no Occasion for this Display of <HI>Profligacy:</HI> For if the previous Estimate, already given, be just; if the Spirit of <HI>Li∣berty, Humanity,</HI> and <HI>Equity,</HI> be in a <HI>cer∣tain Degree</HI> yet left among us, some of the most essential Foundations of abandoned Wickedness and Profligacy can have no Place: For these are <HI>Servility, Cruelty,</HI> and <HI>Oppression.</HI> How far we may be from this last Period of Degeneracy, it were Presumption to affirm: At present, it is certain, we are not arrived at it. When∣ever this fatal Time approaches, it will come distinguished by its proper and pecu∣liar Characters; and whoever shall estimate such Times, will find himself under the same Circumstance with the great Histo∣rian, who, in the profligate Period of de∣clining ROME, tells us he had nothing to relate, but <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"false Accusations, bloody Proscriptions, treacherous Friendships,
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
and the Destruction of the Inno∣cent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="margQuotes">"Saeva jussa, continuas accusationes, fallaces amicitias, perniciem innocentium."</Q> <HI>Tacit. An∣nal.</HI> l. iv.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THIS, we may truly affirm, is far from the Character of the Manners of our Times: which, on a fair Examination, will pro∣bably appear to be that of a <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>"vain, luxu∣rious,</HI> and <HI>selfish</HI> EFFEMINACY."</Q></P>
<P>THIS will be evident from a simple Enu∣meration of acknowledged Facts: many of them indeed, in Appearance, too trite to merit Notice, and too trifling for Rebuke; were they not, in their Tendency, as fa∣tal to the Stability of a Nation, as Maxims and Manners more apparently flagitious.</P>
<P>As the first Habits of Infancy and Youth commonly determine the Character of the
<PB N="30" REF="27"/>
Man, we might trace the Effeminacy of modern Manners, even to the unwhole∣some Warmth of a Nursery. As soon as the puny Infant is suffered to peep from this Fountain of <HI>Weakness</HI> and Disease, he is confirmed in the Habits already contract∣ed, by a mistaken Tenderness and Care. The <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"School Boy's Satchel, and shining Morning-Face,"</Q> once the Characteristic of the Age itself, are now only to be seen among the Sons of Villagers and Peasants; while the Youth of Quality and Fortune is wrapt up from the wholesome Keenness of the Air: And thus becomes incapable of enduring the natural Rigours of his own Climate.</P>
<P>'TIS odds, indeed, but the Prevalence of Fashion places him in some public School, where the learned Languages are taught: And, to do Justice to the Times, the most considerable among these Semi∣naries
<PB N="31" REF="28"/>
were never more ably supplied than at present. But whatever be the Master's Ability, the Scholar's can in general reach no farther than to <HI>Words;</HI> this first Stage of Education, therefore, can only be prepa∣ratory to a higher; without which, the other is defeated of its Purpose.</P>
<P>HERE, then, lies an essential Defect in modern Education. The Pupil is not carried on from <HI>Words</HI> to <HI>Things.</HI> The <HI>Universities,</HI> where the Principles of <HI>Know∣ledge</HI> should be imbibed, are growing daily thinner of young Men of Quality and Fortune. Instead of being initiated in <HI>Books,</HI> where the Wisdom of Ages lies re∣posed, our untutored Youth are carried into the <HI>World;</HI> where the ruling Objects that catch the Imagination, are the Sallies of Folly or of Vice.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="29"/>
THUS like <HI>Plants</HI> hastily removed from their first Bed, and exposed to the Inclemencies of an unwholesome Air, without the Intervention of a higher and more enlarged <HI>Nursery,</HI> where stronger Shoots might be obtained, our rising Youth are checked in their <HI>first Growths,</HI> and either <HI>die away</HI> into Ignorance, or, at most, become <HI>Dwarfs</HI> in Knowledge.</P>
<P>BUT here, it must not be disguised; that an Abuse, through Time, hath insensibly crept upon the <HI>Universities</HI> themselves, and greatly impaired their Use and Credit. The public Fountains of Instruction are at length dried up; and the <HI>Professorships,</HI> founded as the Means of general Instruction, dege∣nerated into gainful <HI>Sine-cures.</HI> Instead of these, where, by a proper Choice, every Department would naturally be filled with Ability in its respective Science; the <HI>pri∣vate</HI> Lectures of <HI>College-Tutors</HI> have usurped
<PB N="33" REF="30"/>
and occupied their Place. Thus the great Lines of Knowledge are broken, and the Fragments retailed at all Adventures, by <HI>every Member</HI> of a College, who chuseth to erect himself into a <HI>Professor of every Sci∣ence.</HI> What can be the Consequence of this Practice, but a <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>superficial Instruction?</HI> 'Tis true, there are in this Sphere, who would do Honour to the high∣est Academical Station: But what an Ac∣cession of Lustre, Fame, and Knowledge, would our Universities receive, were these <HI>few,</HI> now confined to the narrow Sphere of <HI>particular</HI> Colleges, ordained and <HI>appointed</HI> to <HI>illuminate</HI> the <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER would it reflect any Dishonour on our Universities, if the few young Men of Fashion yet found there, were laid under the same Restraints of moral and literary Discipline, with those of inferior Quality.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="31"/>
THE next Error that presents itself to Observation, is that of sending our ignorant Youth abroad. A Mind stored with Taste and Knowledge, will indeed naturally re∣fine that Taste, and increase that Know∣ledge, by seeing and <HI>judging</HI> of foreign Countries. For thus he acquires a large Addition of new Experiences and Exam∣ples, which may confirm or rectify his prior Observations. On the contrary, we may affirm, with Truth, that no Circumstance in Education can more surely tend to strengthen Effeminacy and Ignorance, than the present premature, and indigested <HI>Tra∣vel.</HI> For as the uninstructed Youth must needs meet with a Variety of Example, good and bad, vile and praise-worthy, as his Man∣ners are childish, and his Judgment crude, he will naturally imbibe what is most con∣sentaneous with his puerile Habits. Thus, while Wisdom and Virtue can find no Place
<PB N="35" REF="32"/>
in him, every Foreign Folly, Effeminacy, or Vice, meeting with a correspondent Soil, at once take Root and flourish.</P>
<P>BUT suppose him <HI>not</HI> of that Rank or Fortune, which may demand or admit of the grand Tour; he is then brought up to <HI>London,</HI> and initiated in the Pleasures of the Metropolis. Here then let us view him, inspired with every fashionable Ambition; while we take an impartial Estimate of those Amusements, or rather Employments, which attract the Attention of the Town, and form the Genius and Character of the present and rising Generation.</P>
<P>THE first and capital Article of Town-Effeminacy is that of <HI>Dress:</HI> which, in all its Variety of modern Excess and Ridicule, is too low for serious Animadversion. Yet in this, must every Man of every Rank and Age employ his Mornings, who pretends to keep <HI>good Company.</HI> The wisest, the most
<PB N="36" REF="33"/>
virtuous, the most polite, if defective in these exterior and unmanly Delicacies, are avoided as <HI>low People,</HI> whom <HI>Nobody knows,</HI> and with whom one is <HI>ashamed to be seen.</HI></P>
<P>How would he have been derided in the Days of ELIZABETH, when a great Queen rode on Horseback to <HI>St. Paul's,</HI> who should have foretold, that in less than two Centuries no Man of Fashion would cross the Street to Dinner, without the ef∣feminate Covering and Conveyance of an <HI>easy Chair?</HI></P>
<P>YET thus accoutred, the modern Man of Fashion is <HI>conveyed</HI> to Company. Where∣ever he goes, he meets the same false De∣licacy in all: Every Circumstance of mo∣dern Use conspires to sooth him into the Excess of Effeminacy: Warm Carpets are spread under his Feet; warm Hangings
<PB N="37" REF="34"/>
surround him; Doors and Windows nicely jointed prevent the least rude Encroach∣ment of the external Air.</P>
<P>VANITY lends her Aid to this unmanly Delicacy: Splendid Furniture, a sumptu∣ous Side-board, a long Train of Attendants, an elegant and costly Entertainment, for which Earth, Air, and Seas, are ransacked, the most expensive Wines of the Continent, the childish Vagaries of a whimsical Desert, these are the supreme Pride of the Master, the Admiration or Envy of his Guests.</P>
<P>LUXURY is not idle in her Province, but shares with her Sister Vanity, in the La∣bours of the Day. High Soups and Sauces, every Mode of foreign Cookery that can quicken Taste, and spur the lagging Ap∣petite, is assiduously employed. The End of Eating is not the allaying of natural Hun∣ger,
<PB N="38" REF="35"/>
but the Gratification of fordid and de∣basing Appetite. Hence the most inflaming Foods, not those which <HI>nourish,</HI> but those which <HI>irritate,</HI> are adopted; while the cool and temperate Diets that purify the Blood, are banished to inferior Tables. To this every Man of Taste now aspires, as to the true <HI>sçavoir vivre.</HI></P>
<P>Do you expect in these fashionable Meetings, to hear some Point of Morals, Taste in Arts or Literature, discoursed or canvassed? Alas! these are long since ex∣pelled from every modish Assembly. To speak any thing that carries Weight and Importance, is an Offence against Good∣breeding. The supreme Elegance is, to trifle agreeably.</P>
<P>BUT as Insipidity of Conversation is soon worn out, and as Intemperance in Wine is
<PB N="39" REF="36"/>
not of the Character of refined Luxury; so, to prevent the Stagnation of Folly, some awakening Amusement is naturally sought for.</P>
<P>WE read in ancient Story, that in the most polished Court of the most refined Period, a Reward was proclaimed to him, who should invent a new Pleasure. This may justly be styled, the last wretched Ef∣sort of bungling and despairing Luxury.—The great Desideratum is at length found: A Pleasure which absorbs the whole Man; a Pleasure in which there is no Satiety; which cloys not by Use, but gains new Vigour from Enjoyment. The Vulgar only can need to be informed, that the Pleasure here alluded to, is that of GAM∣ING.</P>

BUT as the present increasing Splendor of Dress, Equipage, Furniture, Enter∣—tainments, is enormously expensive; what can so naturally create a Lust of Gold, as the vain Ambition of Equality or Superio∣rity in this System of effeminate Shew? Hence, <HI>Rapacity</HI> attends <HI>Profusion;</HI> till the Spirit of Avarice glides secretly into the Soul; and impels the Man of Fashion to that <HI>Gaming,</HI> as a <HI>Trade,</HI> which he had be∣fore adopted as a <HI>Pleasure.</HI> But as we read that CAESAR's Lust was only the <HI>Servant</HI> of his <HI>Ambition,</HI> so this Lust of Gold is no more than the <HI>Handmaid</HI> to vain <HI>Effemi∣nacy.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we see <HI>Gaming</HI> established on the two great Pillars of <HI>Self Interest</HI> and <HI>Pleasure:</HI> and on these Foundations seems to rest the midnight Riot and Dissipation of modern Assemblies.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="38"/>
BUT tho' Gaming be now the capital Pleasure, as well as Trade, of most Men of Fashion; yet other incidental Amuse∣ments intervene at vacant Times. Neither can it be affirmed with Truth, that all are immersed in this fashionable Folly. Nor let any one imagine, that he stands clear of the ruling Manners of the Times, be∣cause not infected with the Rage of <HI>Gaming.</HI> Let us then proceed to examine the other reigning Amusements of the Age; and see how far they are, or are not, subject to the Charge of <HI>unmanly</HI> Delicacy.</P>
<P>A KNOWLEDGE of Books, a Taste in Arts, a Proficiency in Science, was for∣merly regarded as a proper Qualification, in a Man of Fashion. The Annals of our Country have transmitted to us the Name and Memory of Men, as eminent in Learning and Taste, as in Rank and For∣tune.
<PB N="42" REF="39"/>
It will not, I presume, be regarded as any kind of Satire on the present Age, to say, that among the higher Ranks, this literary Spirit is generally vanished. <HI>Reading</HI> is now sunk at best into a Morning's <HI>Amuse∣ment;</HI> till the important Hour of Dress comes on. Books are no longer regarded as the Repositories of Taste and Know∣ledge; but are rather laid hold of, as a gentle Relaxation from the tedious Round of Pleasure.</P>
<P>BUT what kind of Reading must <HI>that</HI> be, which can attract or entertain the lan∣guid Morning-Spirit of modern Effemi∣nacy? Any, indeed, that can but pre∣vent the unsupportable Toil of <HI>Thinking;</HI> that may serve as a preparatory <HI>Whet</HI> of <HI>In∣dolence,</HI> to the approaching Pleasures of the Day. Thus it comes to pass, that weekly Essays, amatory Plays and Novels, politi∣cal
<PB N="43" REF="40"/>
Pamphlets, and Books that revile Re∣ligion; together with a general <HI>Hash</HI> of these, served up in some <HI>monthly Mess</HI> of <HI>Dulness,</HI> are the meagre <HI>literary Diet</HI> of Town and Country.</P>
<P>TRUE it is, that amidst this general De∣fect of Taste and Learning, there is <HI>a Writer,</HI> whose Force of Genius, and Ex∣tent of Knowledge, might almost redeem the Character of the Times. But that Su∣periority, which attracts the Reverence of the <HI>Few,</HI> excites the Envy and Hatred of the <HI>Many:</HI> And while his Works are tran∣slated and admired <HI>Abroad,</HI> and patronized at <HI>Home,</HI> by those who are most distin∣guished in Genius, Taste, and Learning, himself is abused, and his Friends insulted for his Sake, by those who never read his Writings, or, if they did, could neither <HI>taste</HI> nor <HI>comprehend</HI> them: while every
<PB N="44" REF="41"/>
little aspiring or despairing Scribler eyes him as CASSIUS did CESAR, and whispers to his Fellow,
<Q><L>Why Man, he doth bestride the narrow World</L>
<L>Like a <HI>Colossus;</HI> and we petty Men</L>
<L>Walk under his huge Legs; and peep about,</L>
<L>To find ourselves dishonourable Graves.</L></Q>
No wonder then, if the Malice of the <HI>Lil∣liputian</HI> Tribe be bent against this dreaded GULLIVER; if they attack him with <HI>poi∣soned Arrows,</HI> whom they cannot subdue by <HI>Strength.</HI></P>
<P>BUT in Justice to the present Age, ano∣ther Observation must be added. As Ex∣cess of Delicacy hath destroyed our <HI>Force of Taste;</HI> it hath at least had one laudable Effect: for along with this, it hath carried off our <HI>Grossness</HI> of <HI>Obscenity.</HI> A strong Characteristic, this, of the Man∣ners of the Times: The untractable
<PB N="45" REF="42"/>
Spirit of Lewdness is sunk into gentle Gal∣lantry, and <HI>Obscenity</HI> itself is grown <HI>effemi∣nate.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what <HI>Vice</HI> hath lost in <HI>Coarseness</HI> of Expression, she hath gained in a more easy and general <HI>Admittance:</HI> In ancient Days, <HI>bare</HI> and <HI>impudent Obscenity,</HI> like a common Woman of the Town, was confined to <HI>Brothels:</HI> Whereas the <HI>Double-Entendre,</HI> like a modern fine Lady, is now admitted into the <HI>best Company;</HI> while her <HI>transparent Covering</HI> of Words, like a <HI>thin</HI> fashionable <HI>Gawze</HI> delicately thrown across, <HI>discloses,</HI> while it seems to <HI>veil,</HI> her <HI>Nakedness</HI> of Thought.</P>
<P>No wonder, if these leading Characters of false Delicacy influence our other En∣tertainments, and be attended with a low and unmanly Taste in <HI>Music.</HI> That divine
<PB N="46" REF="43"/>
Art, capable of inspiring every thing that is great or excellent, of rouzing every no∣bler Passion of the Soul, is at length dwindled into a Woman's or an Eunuch's effeminate Trill. The chaste and solemn Airs of CORELLI, of GEMINIANI, and their best Disciples; the divine and lofty Flights of CALDARA and MARCELLO; the elegant Simplicity of BONONCINI; the manly, the pathetic, the astonishing Strains of HANDEL, are neglected and despised: While instead of these, our Con∣certs and Operas are disgraced with the lowest Insipidity of Composition, and un∣meaning <HI>Sing-Song.</HI> The Question now concerns not the Expression, the Grace, the Energy, or Dignity of the Musick: We go not to admire the <HI>Composition,</HI> but the <HI>Tricks</HI> of the <HI>Performer;</HI> who is then surest of our ignorant Applause, when he runs through the Compass of the <HI>Throat,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="44"/>
or traverses the <HI>Finger-board</HI> with the <HI>swiftest Dexterity.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE <HI>Music</HI> is thus debased into Effe∣minacy, her Sister-Art of <HI>Painting</HI> cannot hope a better Fate: For the same Dignity of Manners must <HI>support;</HI> the same Indig∣nity <HI>depress</HI> them. Connoisseurs there are, indeed, who have either <HI>Taste</HI> or <HI>Va∣nity:</HI> Yet even by these, the Art is consi∣dered as a Matter of <HI>Curiosity,</HI> not of <HI>In∣fluence;</HI> a Circumstance which proves their Taste to be spurious, undirected, or super∣ficial. But with regard to the public Eye; this is generally depraved. Neither the comic Pencil, nor the serious Pen of our ingenious Countryman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hogarth's</HI> Treatise on the Principles of Beauty.</NOTE>, have been able to keep alive the Taste of Nature, or of Beauty. The fantastic and grotesque have banished <HI>both.</HI> Every House of Fashion is
<PB N="48" REF="45"/>
now crowded with Porcelain Trees and Birds, Porcelain Men and Beasts, cross∣legged Mandarins and Bramins, perpen∣dicular Lines and stiff right Angles: Every gaudy <HI>Chinese</HI> Crudity, either in Colour, Form, Attitude, or Grouping, is adopted into fashionable Use, and become the Standard of Taste and Elegance.</P>
<P>LET us then search the Theatre for the Remains of manly Taste: And <HI>here,</HI> ap∣parently at least, it must be acknowledged we shall find it. A great Genius hath arisen to dignify the Stage; who, when it was sinking into the lowest Insipidity, re∣stored it to the Fulness of its ancient Splen∣dor, and, with a Variety of Powers beyond Example, established <HI>Nature, Shakespear,</HI> and <HI>Himself.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as the Attractions of the Theatre arise from a Complication of Causes, be∣yond
<PB N="49" REF="46"/>
those of any other Entertainment; so while the judicious Critic admires his ori∣ginal Excellencies, it may well be questi∣oned whether the Crowd be not drawn by certain secondary Circumstances, rather than by a Discernment of his real Powers. Need we any other Proof of this, than the Conduct of his fashionable Hearers? who sit with the same Face of Admiration at LEAR, an OPERA, or a PANTOMIME.</P>
<P>THESE seem to be the main and leading Articles of our unmanly Winter-Delicacies. And as to our Summer-Amusements, they are much of the same <HI>Make,</HI> only <HI>lighter,</HI> and if possible more <HI>trifling.</HI> As soon as the Season is grown so mild, as that the Man of Fashion can stir abroad, he is seen lolling in his <HI>Post-Chariot,</HI> about the Purlieus of the Town. The manly Exercise of <HI>Riding</HI> is generally disused, as
<PB N="50" REF="47"/>
too coarse and indelicate for the fine Gen∣tleman. The Metropolis growing thin as the Spring advances, the same Rage of Pleasure, Dress, Equipage, and Dissipa∣tion, which in Winter had chained him to the Town, now drives him to the Coun∣try. For as a vain and empty Mind can never give Entertainment to itself; so, to avoid the Taedium of Solitude and Self-Converse, <HI>Parties</HI> of Pleasure are again formed; the same Effeminacies, under new Appearances, are acted over again, and become the <HI>Business</HI> of the Season. There is hardly a Corner of the Kingdom, where a <HI>Summer Scene</HI> of public <HI>Dissipation</HI> is not now established: Here the Parties meet till the Winter sets in, and the separate So∣cieties are once more met in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we have attempted a simple Deli∣neation of the ruling Manners of the Times:
<PB N="51" REF="48"/>
If any thing like Ridicule appears to mix itself with this Review, it ariseth not from the <HI>Aggravation,</HI> but the natural <HI>Display</HI> of <HI>Folly.</HI></P>
<P>IT may probably be asked, Why the rul∣ing Manners of our Women have not been particularly delineated? The Reason is, be∣cause they are essentially the same with those of the Men, and are therefore included in this Estimate. The Sexes have now lit∣tle other apparent Distinction, beyond that of Person and Dress: Their peculiar and characteristic Manners are confounded and lost: The one Sex having advanced into <HI>Boldness,</HI> as the other have sunk into <HI>Effe∣minacy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Of Principles.</HEAD>
<P>MOST Writers, who have attempted to prove the Efficacy of Principle, have sup∣posed it to be the great and universal Foun∣tain of Manners: They who have espoused the opposite System, observing this Theory to be at variance with Fact, have rashly concluded that Principle is void of all real Influence.</P>
<P>THE Truth seems to lie between these two Opinions. Principles cannot be the Fountain of Manners, because Manners precede Principles: That is, in our Pro∣gress from Infancy, Habits of <HI>Acting</HI> are <HI>prior</HI> to Habits of <HI>Thinking.</HI> Yet on the other Hand, Principles, early and deeply ingrafted in the Mind, may grow up with
<PB N="53" REF="50"/>
Manners; may be at variance with Man∣ners; may yield to Manners; or, gathering Strength by Cultivation, may check, con∣troll, or destroy them.</P>
<P>THIS Distinction is proper for many Reasons. One is evident: It shews the Propriety of treating of the Manners <HI>first,</HI> and <HI>then</HI> the Principles of the Times.</P>
<P>THE Principles here to be estimated, are such only as tend to counterwork the <HI>selfish Passions.</HI> These are, the Principle of <HI>Religion,</HI> the Principle of <HI>Honour,</HI> and the Principle of <HI>public Spirit.</HI> The first of these has the <HI>Deity</HI> for it's Object; the second, the <HI>Applause</HI> of Men; the third, the <HI>Ap∣probation</HI> of <HI>our own Heart.</HI> Let us exa∣mine the present Influence of these several Principles on the Manners already de∣lineated.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="51"/>
DID the Writer court the Applause of his polite Readers (if any such peradven∣ture may honour him with their Regard) he would preface this Part of his Subject with an Apology, for the Rudeness of hint∣ing at <HI>religious Principle.</HI> To suppose a Man of Fashion swayed in his Conduct by a Regard to <HI>Futurity,</HI> is an Affront to the Delicacy and Refinement of his <HI>Taste.</HI> Hence the Day set apart by the Laws of his Country for religious Service, he derides and affronts as a <HI>vulgar</HI> and <HI>obsolete</HI> Institu∣tution: Should you propose to him the Re∣newal of that <HI>Family Devotion,</HI> which con∣cluded the guiltless Evening Entertainments of his Ancestry? You would become an Object of his Pity, rather than Contempt. The sublime Truths, the pure and simple Morals of the Gospel, are despised and trod under foot. Can we wonder, if that Pro∣fession
<PB N="55" REF="52"/>
which asserts these Truths, and preaches these Morals, be treated with a similar Contempt? But Irreligion knows no Bounds, when once let loose: and Christianity herself hath been obliquely in∣sulted within those <HI>consecrated</HI> Walls, where <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Policy,</HI> in the Absence of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> would for ever have held her in <HI>legal Reverence.</HI></P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding the general Con∣tempt of Religion among the fashionable World, the uninformed Reader is not to imagine, that the present Age is deep in the <HI>Speculations</HI> of <HI>Infidelity.</HI> No such Matter: for that would imply a certain <HI>At∣tention</HI> to these Subjects; a certain Degree of Self-Converse and Thought; and this would clash with the ruling Manners of the Times. Indeed there have not been want∣ing laborious Husbandmen, who have pain∣fully
<PB N="56" REF="53"/>
sown their Tares; not in the Night Season, but in broad Day-light. These have at length shot up into a large and fruit∣ful Crop of <HI>irreligious implicit</HI> FAITH: For implicit Faith is <HI>Belief</HI> or <HI>Disbelief,</HI> without Evidence; and <HI>why</HI> they disbelieve, I trow, few of the present Age can tell. They have other Attentions, than the meagre Sophisms of Irreligion; and are therefore well content with the <HI>Conclusions,</HI> without the <HI>Premises.</HI> This Distinction will lead us to the plain Reason, why in an Age of Irreligion, so capital a Book as the Writings of Lord BOLINGBROKE, met with so cold a Reception in the World. Had they ap∣peared under the inviting Shape of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ES∣SAYS <HI>philosophical and moral,"</HI></Q> they might have come within the Compass of a Break∣fast-reading, or amused the Man of Fashion while under the Discipline of the <HI>curling Tongs:</HI> But five <HI>huge Quarto</HI> Volumes (like
<PB N="57" REF="54"/>
five <HI>coarse</HI> Dishes of Beef and Mutton) tho' fraught with the very <HI>Marrow</HI> of Infide∣lity, what <HI>puny</HI> modern <HI>Appetite</HI> could possibly <HI>sit down to?</HI></P>
<P>IN Confirmation of these Truths, we may conclude this Part of our Subject with a not incurious Anecdote. A certain His∣torian of our own Times, bent upon <HI>Popu∣larity</HI> and <HI>Gain,</HI> published a large Volume, and omitted no Opportunity that offered, to disgrace Religion: A large Impression was published, and a small Part sold. The Author being asked, why he had so larded his Work with Irreligion, his Answer modestly implied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He had done it, that his Book might sell."</Q>—It was whispered him, that he had totally mistaken the Spirit of the Times: that no Allurements could engage the <HI>fashionable</HI> Infidel World to travel through a large Quarto: And that as the
<PB N="58" REF="55"/>
few Readers of Quarto's that yet remain, lie mostly among the serious Part of Man∣kind, he had offended his best Customers, and ruined the Sale of his Book. This In∣formation had a notable Effect: for a se∣cond Volume, as large and instructive as the first, hath appeared; not a Smack of Irreligion is to be found in it; and an Apo∣logy for the <HI>first</HI> concludes the whole.</P>
<P>THIS being the State of religious Prin∣ciple, let us next examine how it fares with the <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Honour.</HI> By this is meant, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Desire of Fame, or the Ap∣plause of Men, directed to the End of public Happiness."</Q> Now this great Am∣bition, which in other Times or Nations hath wrought such wonderful Effects, is no longer to be found among us. It is the Pride of <HI>Equipage,</HI> the Pride of <HI>Title,</HI> the Pride of <HI>Fortune,</HI> or the Pride of <HI>Dress,</HI> that
<PB N="59" REF="56"/>
have assumed the Empire over our Souls, and levelled <HI>Ambition</HI> with the <HI>Dirt.</HI> The honest Pride of <HI>Virtue</HI> is <HI>no more;</HI> or, where it happens to exist, is overwhelmed by in∣ferior Vanities. A Man who should go out of the common Road of Life, in Pur∣suit of Glory, and serve the Public at the Expence of his Ease, his Fortune, or his Pleasure, would be stared or laughed at in every fashionable Circle, as a silly Fellow, who meddled with Things that did not be∣long to him: As an Ideot, who preferred Shadows to Realities, and needless Toil to pleasurable Enjoyment. The laurel Wreath, once aspired after as the highest Object of Ambition, would now be rated at the Market-price of its Materials, and derided as a <HI>three-penny Crown.</HI> And if its modern Substitutes, the <HI>Ribbon</HI> or the <HI>Coronet,</HI> be eagerly sought for, it is not that they are regarded as the <HI>Distinctions</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="57"/>
of <HI>public Virtue,</HI> but as the <HI>Ensigns</HI> of <HI>Va∣nity</HI> and <HI>Place.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what implies or proves the gene∣ral Extinction of the Principle of Honour, is a peculiar Circumstance, which at first View seems to challenge Praise. It hath been weakly attributed to the moderate and forgiving Spirit of these Times, that no Age ever so patiently suffered its ruling Follies to be laughed at. But this, in truth, is a superficial and inadequate Representa∣tion, as well as Solution, of the Fact. We not only suffer our ruling Vices and Follies to be ridiculed, but we cordially join in the Laugh. Was there ever a juster Picture drawn, than of modern <HI>Effeminacy</HI> and <HI>Nonchalance</HI> in the Characters of FRIBBLE and Lord CHALKSTONE? Did ever dra∣matic Characters raise louder Peals of Laughter and Applause, even among those
<PB N="61" REF="58"/>
who sat for the Likeness? They hear with Pleasure, they acknowledge the Truth of the Representation, they laugh at the Picture of their own Follies; they go home, and <HI>without a Blush repeat them.</HI> The Truth is, therefore, that we can see and own our Vices and Follies, <HI>without being touched with Shame:</HI> a Circumstance which ancient Times justly regarded as the strongest Indication of de∣generate and incorrigible Manners.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that the Principle of Honour is either lost, or totally corrupted: That no generous Thirst of Praise is left among us: That our Ambitions are trifling and unmanly as our Pleasures: That Wealth, Titles, Dress, Equipage, Sagacity in Gaming or Wagers, splendid Furniture and a Table, are the sole Fountains, from which we desire to draw Respect to our∣selves, or Applause from others: We as∣pire
<PB N="62" REF="59"/>
to Folly, and are proud of Meanness: Thus, the Principle of <HI>Honour</HI> is perverted, and dwindled into <HI>unmanly Vanity.</HI></P>
<P>CAN it be imagined, that, amidst this ge∣neral Defect of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> the great and comprehensive Principle of <HI>pub∣lic Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Love of our Country,</HI> can gain a Place in our Breasts? That mighty Prin∣ciple, so often feigned, so seldom possessed; which requires the united Force of upright <HI>Manners,</HI> generous <HI>Religion,</HI> and unfeigned <HI>Honour,</HI> to support it. What Strength of Thought or conscious Merit can there be in effeminate Minds, sufficient to ele∣vate them to this Principle, whose Ob∣ject is, <Q REND="inline">"the Happiness of a Kingdom?"</Q> To speak therefore without Flattery, this Principle is perhaps less felt among us, than even those of Religion and true Honour. So infatuated are we in our Contempt of this powerful Principle, that we deride
<PB N="63" REF="60"/>
the Inhabitants of a <HI>Sister-Kingdom,</HI> for their <HI>national Attachments</HI> and <HI>Regards.</HI> So little are we accustomed to go, or even <HI>think,</HI> beyond the beaten Track of private Interest, in all Things that regard our <HI>Country;</HI> that he who merely does his <HI>Duty</HI> in any conspicuous Station, is looked on as a Prodigy of public Virtue. But in other Times and Nations, when this Principle was in Force, Enterprises were formed, and Deeds done, which it would now be thought Phrenzy to attempt. Think what a Friend will do for a Friend; a Sister for a Brother, a Lover for his Mistress, a Pa∣rent for his Child; even <HI>that,</HI> in all its Fulness of Affection, in other Times and Nations, hath been the Aim and the Work of public Virtue, <HI>doing</HI> or <HI>suffering</HI> for its <HI>Country's Welfare.</HI></P>
<P>DOMESTIC Affections are not yet gene∣rally extinguished: There are kind Fa∣thers,
<PB N="64" REF="61"/>
kind Mothers, affectionate Children, Sisters, Brothers: Humanity to Distress, we have already marked as another Cha∣racter of the Times: But whether our very Effeminacy be not one of its Sources, might probably be a Question more <HI>curious</HI> in its Progress, than <HI>agreeable</HI> in its Solution.</P>
<P>HOWEVER that be, let us be modest in our Claims, and confess, that our Affecti∣ons seldom reach farther than our Rela∣tions, our Friends, or Individuals in Di∣stress. Happy (in the present) it is for us, that they reach so far. Happy were it for us, or our Posterity, that they were of more inlarged Extent. In the mean Time, let us with due Abasement of Heart acknow∣ledge, that the <HI>Love</HI> of our <HI>Country</HI> is no longer felt; and that, except in a few Minds of uncommon Greatness, the Prin∣ciple of <HI>public Spirit</HI> EXISTS NOT.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="62"/>
IT is not affirmed or implied, in this general Review, that <HI>every Individual</HI> hath assumed the Garb and Character of false Delicacy, and uncontrouled Self-Love: As in <HI>manly</HI> Ages, some will be <HI>effeminate;</HI> so, in <HI>effeminate</HI> Times, the <HI>manly</HI> Cha∣racter will be found: As in Times of Prin∣ciple, some will be void of Principle; so, in Times when Principle is derided, in some superior Minds Principle will be found. But from the general Combination of Man∣ners and Principles, in every Period of Time, will always result one ruling and predominant Character; as from a con∣fused Multitude of different Voices, results one general Murmur, and strikes the di∣stant Ear; or from a Field covered with Flocks, Herds, or Armies, though vari∣ous in themselves, results one general and permanent Colour, and strikes the distant Eye:</P>

<P>IT is enough, then, if from a proper <HI>Point of View,</HI> we have fixed the <HI>ruling Colour</HI> of the Manners and Principles, for on this will depend the <HI>ruling Character</HI> of the <HI>Times.</HI></P>
<P>AS it appears, therefore, from this De∣lineation, that SHOW and PLEASURE are the main Objects of Pursuit: As the gene∣ral Habit of <HI>refined Indulgence</HI> is <HI>strong,</HI> and the Habit of <HI>induring</HI> is <HI>lost:</HI> As the ge∣neral Spirit of <HI>Religion, Honour,</HI> and <HI>pub∣lick Love,</HI> are weakened or vanished; as
<PB N="67" REF="64"/>
these Manners are therefore left to their own Workings, uncontrouled by <HI>Principle;</HI> we may with Truth and Candour con∣clude, that the ruling Character of the present Times is that of <Q REND="inline">"a <HI>vain, luxu∣rious,</HI> and <HI>selfish</HI> EFFEMINACY."</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. What constitutes the Strength of a Nation.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have done little more than <HI>delineate</HI> the ruling Man∣ners and Principles of the Times: we must now assume a severer Tone, and <HI>reason</HI> upon the <HI>Facts</HI> thus established.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="67"/>
THERE are three leading Circumstances on which the <HI>internal Strength</HI> of every Nation most essentially depends: These are, the <HI>Capacity, Valour,</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> of those who <HI>lead</HI> the People. The first may be called, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the <HI>national Capacity;</HI> the second the <HI>national Spirit of Defence;</HI> the third, the national <HI>Spirit of Union."</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE next Step, therefore, will be, to consider all that Variety of Respects, in which the ruling Manners and Defect of Principle, already delineated, must natu∣rally weaken or destroy these Sources of <HI>internal</HI> Power.</P>
<P>As this Enquiry will of course lead to a particular View of those several Ranks, Departments, Employments, or Professi∣ons, into which such a Nation is divided;
<PB N="73" REF="68"/>
it is presumed, that no Instances alledged, or Facts alluded to, will be weakly con∣strued into the Wantonness of licentious Satire. Every Profession is honourable, when directed to its proper End, the Pub∣lick Welfare: And the Intention of this Estimate is not to <HI>defame;</HI> but to <HI>enquire</HI> how far the several <HI>Departments</HI> or <HI>Profes∣sions,</HI> on which the internal Strength of this Nation depends, are <HI>properly</HI> or <HI>improperly</HI> directed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II. Of the national Capacity.</HEAD>
<P>LET us then first enquire, how far the false Delicacy and Effeminacy of present Manners may have weakened or destroyed the <HI>national Capacity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="69"/>IT was a shrewd Observation of a good old Writer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How can he get Wisdom, whose Talk is of Bullocks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book of Wisdom.</NOTE>?"</Q> But <HI>Rus∣ticity</HI> is not more an Enemy of Knowledge, than <HI>Effeminacy:</HI> With the same Pro∣priety therefore it may now be asked, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How can he get Wisdom, whose Talk is of <HI>Dress</HI> and <HI>Wagers, Cards</HI> and <HI>Borough-jobbing, Horses, Women,</HI> and <HI>Dice?"</HI></Q> The Man of Fashion is indeed cut off from the very Means of solid In∣struction. His late Hours occasion a late rising; and thus the Morning, which should be devoted to the Acquisition of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> is devoted to <HI>Sleep,</HI> to <HI>Dress,</HI> and <HI>Ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>HOW weak then must be the national Capacity of that People, whose leading

Members in <HI>public Employ</HI> should, in general, be formed on such a Model? If instead of a general Application to Books, instead of investigating the great Principles of <HI>Legislation,</HI> the Genius of their national Constitution, or its Relations and Depen∣dencies on that of others, the great Ex∣amples and Truths of <HI>History,</HI> the Maxims of generous and upright <HI>Policy,</HI> and the severer Truths of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> on which all these are founded;—if instead of these, they should seldom rise in <HI>political</HI> Study higher than the securing of a <HI>Borough;</HI> instead of <HI>History,</HI> be only read in <HI>Novels;</HI> instead of <HI>Legislation,</HI> in <HI>Party Pamphlets;</HI> instead of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> in <HI>Irreligion;</HI> instead of manly and upright <HI>Manners,</HI> in trifling <HI>Entertainments, Dress,</HI> and <HI>Gaming:—</HI>If this should ever be their ruling Character, what must be expected from such esta∣blished
<PB N="76" REF="71"/>
<HI>Ignorance,</HI> but <HI>Errors</HI> in the first Concoction?</P>
<P>IN a Nation thus circumstanced, it is odds but you would see even some of its most public and solemn Assemblies turned into Scenes of unmanly Riot; instead of the <HI>Dignity</HI> of <HI>Freedom,</HI> the <HI>Tumults</HI> of <HI>Licentiousness</HI> would prevail. Forward∣ness of young Men without Experience, intemperate Ridicule, dissolute Mirth, and loud Peals of Laughter, would be the ruling Character of such an Assembly.</P>
<P>THIS Reflexion, some how or other, calls up the Memory of a Circumstance or two, peculiar to the public Meetings of the <HI>Athenians.</HI> In the Court of <HI>Areopagus,</HI> so little was <HI>Ridicule</HI> regarded as a <HI>Test of Truth,</HI> that it was held an unpardonable Offence, for any Member to <HI>laugh</HI> while
<PB N="77" REF="72"/>
the Assembly was sitting.—Another wise and prudent Regulation was the Practice of the <HI>Cryer</HI> in the <HI>Senate;</HI> who, before Business began, called out aloud, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who will speak that is turned of Fifty?"</Q></P>
<P>IT is true, that in every Assembly of this Kind, the public Measures will gene∣rally be determined by the <HI>Few,</HI> whose Su∣periority is approved and acknowledged: By the <HI>Few,</HI> who have been so unfashio∣nable as to despise the ruling System of Effeminacy: and before they had ap∣peared on a <HI>higher Stage,</HI> had <HI>laboured</HI> and <HI>shone</HI> in a <HI>College.</HI> But what an Increase of <HI>national Capacity</HI> must arise, if those <HI>Master-Spirits</HI> were aided, and their Plans of Government examined and improved, by Men of the like <HI>Application</HI> and <HI>Ability?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="73"/>
BUT if, in any Nation, the Number of these superior Minds be daily decreasing, from the growing Manners of the Times; what can a Nation, so circumstanced, have more to fear, than that in another Age, a general Cloud of Ignorance may over∣shadow it?</P>
<P>How much, or how little, in this Par∣ticular, <HI>we</HI> resemble the declining State of the <HI>Roman</HI> Republic, let any one determine from the following Passage: Where the great Author, after celebrating the general <HI>Ability</HI> of those who were <HI>formerly</HI> in pub∣lic Station, concludes thus: <Q LANG="lat" REND="inline margQuotes">"Nunc con∣tra, plerique ad honores adipiscendos, et ad rempublicam gerendam, <HI>nudi</HI> veniunt atque <HI>inermes,</HI> nulla cognitione rerum, nulla scientia ornati <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cic. de Oratore, l. iii.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="74"/>
LET us next consider the natural Effects of these effeminate Manners, on <HI>Fleets</HI> and <HI>Armies.</HI> And here, 'tis supposed, it will be readily acknowledged, that the Con∣duct and Fate of Fleets and Armies depend much on the Capacity of those that lead them, through every Rank of Office. Chiefly, indeed, of those who are <HI>highest</HI> in Command; but in Part too, of those who fill the <HI>lower</HI> Stations: the more, be∣cause they in inferior Rank <HI>aspire,</HI> and by Degrees <HI>ascend,</HI> to the highest.</P>
<P>Now, I apprehend, it would be ill taken, to <HI>suppose,</HI> that the fashionable and <HI>prevailing Manners</HI> abound not in the <HI>Army</HI> and <HI>Navy.</HI> The Gentlemen of these Professions are even <HI>distinguished</HI> by their Taste in <HI>Dress,</HI> their Skill at <HI>Play,</HI> their Attendance on every <HI>Amusement,</HI> pro∣vided
<PB N="80" REF="75"/>
it be but <HI>fashionable.</HI> And sure, it must be by Miracle, if this trifling and effeminate Life conduct them to <HI>Know∣ledge,</HI> or produce <HI>Capacity.</HI> It were unjust to deny, that Men of Ability in this Order, are <HI>yet</HI> among us. But it would be Matter of great Pleasure and Expectation to the Public, to find <HI>Ignorance,</HI> in this <HI>Profes∣sion,</HI> either <HI>uncommon</HI> or <HI>disgraceful.</HI></P>
<P>WOULD these Gentlemen please to look into History, they would find, that in <HI>polished Times,</HI> few have ever distinguished themselves in <HI>War,</HI> who were not eminent or considerable in <HI>Letters.</HI> They would find PISISTRATUS, PERICLES, ALCIBIA∣DES, DION, AGESILAUS, EPAMINONDAS, among the <HI>Greeks:</HI> in the <HI>Roman</HI> List, both the SCIPIO'S, CATO the elder and the younger, LUCULLUS, POMPEY, BRUTUS, CESAR, distinguished in <HI>Letters</HI> as in <HI>War.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="76"/>
'TIS true, indeed, that in barbarous Ages, there want not Instances of unlearn∣ed Leaders, who have done mighty Acti∣ons in Battle. But we must observe, that these were, at least, practised in their own Profession. It is farther to be observed, that in such Times, the Fate of War depends little on <HI>Stratagem</HI> or <HI>Disci∣pline.</HI> But it is chiefly to be observed, that no general Rule can be drawn from a few Instances. A Man of great natural Talents takes mighty Strides in any Science or Profession: He is self-taught: While the common Run of Men, whom Nature hath destined to travel on to Improvement by the beaten Track of Industry, through a blind and ill-understood Imitation of his superior Conduct, must for ever fall the Victims of their <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>HERE then we find another ruling De∣fect in the national Capacity of an effemi∣nate
<PB N="82" REF="77"/>
People. How few can arise, amidst this general <HI>Dissipation</HI> of Manners, capa∣ble of conducting its Fleets and Armies? Or even suppose a Man of Application and Ability possessed of the chief Command; yet, in Case he falls in Battle, how small must be the Chance that the next in Suc∣cession, upon whom his Command natu∣rally devolves, can be <HI>equal</HI> to the Impor∣tance of his <HI>new Station?</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another <HI>Profession,</HI> which, un∣der this Article of the <HI>national Capacity,</HI> the vulgar Reader will naturally expect to find considered. I mean, that of the <HI>Clergy.</HI> But the general Defect of religious Principle among the higher Ranks, hath rendered this order of Men altogether useless, except among those in <HI>middle Life,</HI> where they still maintain a certain Degree of Estimation. The Contempt with which not <HI>they,</HI> but their
<PB N="83" REF="78"/>
<HI>Profession</HI> is treated by the <HI>Ignorant</HI> and <HI>Profligate,</HI> is equally common indeed to <HI>high</HI> and <HI>low</HI> Life: A Circumstance, which may be an Occasion of <HI>Pride</HI> in the <HI>one,</HI> but ought rather to be Matter of <HI>Humilia∣tion</HI> to the other. 'Tis true, a modern Writer felicitates the present Times, and makes it their Boast, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Clergy have lost their Influence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Hume's</HI> Essays.</NOTE>."</Q> By which he evidently means, that Religion hath lost its Influence. Yet of this, at least, one of the Order may decently remind his Coun∣trymen; that when the <HI>English Protestant Clergy,</HI> and that Christianity which they teach, were most <HI>honoured</HI> and respected at <HI>Home, England</HI> was then most honoured and respected <HI>Abroad.</HI></P>
<P>AND although the present fashionable Contempt that is thrown upon their
<PB N="84" REF="79"/>
<HI>Profession,</HI> preclude the Clergy from the <HI>Opportunity,</HI> had they the <HI>Will,</HI> to practice that Christian Duty of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"over∣coming Evil with Good;</Q> yet they need not blush to find, that they have <HI>fallen</HI> with the <HI>Fame,</HI> the <HI>Manners,</HI> and <HI>Princi∣ples</HI> of their Country: nor can the worthy Part of them, sure, aspire to <HI>truer Glory,</HI> than to have become the <HI>Contempt</HI> of <HI>those,</HI> who are become the <HI>Contempt of</HI> EUROPE.</P>
<P>BUT while I defend and <HI>honour</HI> the <HI>Pro∣fession,</HI> I mean not to flatter the <HI>Professors.</HI> As far, therefore, as the Influence of <HI>their</HI> Conduct and Knowledge can be supposed to affect the <HI>national Capacity;</HI> so far, they seem falling into the same unmanly and effeminate Peculiarities, by which their Contemporaries are distinguished: Such of them, I mean, as have Opportunity of conversing with what is called <HI>the World,</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="80"/>
and are supposed to make a Part of it. In their Conduct, they <HI>curb not,</HI> but <HI>promote</HI> and encourage the trifling Manners of the Times: It is grown a fashionable thing, among these Gentlemen, to despise the Duties of their Parish; to wander about, as the various Seasons invite, to every Scene of false Gaiety; to <HI>frequent</HI> and <HI>shine</HI> in all <HI>public</HI> Places, their own <HI>Pulpits</HI> ex∣cepted.</P>
<P>OR if their Age and Situation sets them above these puerile Amusements, are we not to lament, that, instead of a manly and rational Regard to the Welfare of Man∣kind, the chief Employment of many a clerical Life is, to slumber in a <HI>Stall,</HI> haunt <HI>Levees,</HI> or follow the gainful Trade of <HI>Election-jobbing?</HI></P>
<P>IF false Pleasure and Self-Interest thus take Possession of the Heart, how can we ex∣pect
<PB N="86" REF="81"/>
that a Regard for Religion and Chri∣stianity should find a <HI>Place</HI> there?</P>
<P>IN Consequence of these ruling Habits, must we not farther lament, that a gene∣ral Neglect of <HI>Letters</HI> is now creeping even upon this Profession, which ought to main∣tain and support them? Instead of launch∣ing into the <HI>Deeps</HI> of Learning, the fashi∣onable <HI>Divine</HI> hardly ventures on the <HI>Shal∣lows.</HI> The great Works of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> the Monuments of ancient Honour and Wis∣dom, are seldom <HI>opened</HI> or <HI>explored:</HI> and even mere <HI>modern</HI> Books are now gene∣rally read at <HI>second Hand,</HI> through the false Mediums of bald <HI>Translations</HI> or sorry <HI>Ab∣stracts.</HI></P>
<P>THIS seems to be the real State of the <HI>clerical</HI> Profession, so far as it hath Influence on the <HI>national Capacity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="82"/>
THE Writer pretends not in any Case to impose his Opinions; but submits them to the Consideration of the Public. There is a wide Difference between the <HI>Remon∣strances</HI> of <HI>Reason,</HI> and the <HI>Insults</HI> of <HI>Malice</HI> or <HI>Contempt.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the national Spirit of Defence.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING seen how the Manners of the Times have levelled the national <HI>Capacity;</HI> let us next enquire how it fares with the national Spirit of <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
<P>As this Part of our Subject naturally in∣volves a larger Number of the Community than the last, it will be necessary, here, to take a larger Compass.</P>
<P>THE national Spirit of <HI>Defence</HI> then, to speak with Precision, will always be com∣pounded
<PB N="88" REF="83"/>
of the national bodily <HI>Strength, Hardiness, Courage,</HI> and <HI>Principle.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>common People</HI> of this Nation seem possessed of the <HI>three</HI> first of these four Qualities, in a Degree sufficient to form an effectual and national Spirit of Defence. And though they who are selected for pub∣lic <HI>Service</HI> be commonly most <HI>profligate</HI> in Manners, yet as their <HI>Sphere</HI> of Action is <HI>confined,</HI> they commonly have a proporti∣oned <HI>kind of Principle,</HI> which works its Effect in Battle. In the Land Service, they are zealous for the <HI>Honour</HI> of their <HI>Platoon,</HI> their <HI>Company,</HI> their <HI>Regiment.</HI> At Sea, there is the same Emulation, whose <HI>Gun,</HI> whose <HI>Ship,</HI> whose <HI>Squadron,</HI> shall be best <HI>served</HI> and <HI>fought.</HI> It is well known there are no better fighting Men upon Earth. They seldom turn their Backs upon their Enemy, unless when their
<PB N="89" REF="84"/>
Officers shew the Way; and even then, are easily rallied; and return to the Charge with the same Courage.</P>
<P>THUS our <HI>Villages</HI> and <HI>Ports</HI> are an effectual Fund of Supplies for the national Spirit of Defence, in its inferior Depart∣ments.</P>
<P>BUT if we rise, or rather <HI>descend,</HI> to an impartial View of those who are called the <HI>better Sort,</HI> we shall find such a general Defect in the Spirit of <HI>Defence,</HI> as would alarm any People who were not lost to all Sense of <HI>Danger.</HI></P>
<P>OUR effeminate and unmanly Life, working along with our Island-Climate, hath notoriously produced an Increase of <HI>low Spirits</HI> and <HI>nervous Disorders,</HI> whose
<PB N="90" REF="85"/>
natural and unalterable Character is that of <HI>Fear.</HI></P>
<P>AND even where this Distemper <HI>is not,</HI> the present false Delicacy of the fashio∣nable World effectually disqualifies them from <HI>enduring Toil,</HI> or <HI>facing Danger.</HI></P>
<P>ENTHUSIASTIC Religion leads to <HI>Con∣quests;</HI> rational Religion leads to rational <HI>Defence;</HI> but the modern Spirit of <HI>Irreligion</HI> leads to <HI>rascally</HI> and abandoned <HI>Cowardice.</HI> It quenceth every generous Hope that can enlarge the Soul; and levels Mankind with the Beasts that perish.</P>
<P>CAN the Debility of modern Honour produce the manly Spirit of Defence? Alas, if ever it is put in Action by any thing beyond the <HI>Vanity</HI> of <HI>Shew;</HI> it is rouzed by an <HI>Affront,</HI> and dies in a <HI>Duel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="86"/>
How far this dastard Spirit of Effemi∣nacy hath crept upon us, and destroyed the national Spirit of Defence, may appear from the general <HI>Panic</HI> the Nation was thrown into, at the late <HI>Rebellion.</HI> When those of every Rank above a Constable, instead of arming themselves and encourag∣ing the <HI>People,</HI> generally fled before the <HI>Rebels;</HI> while a Mob of ragged Highland∣ers marched unmolested to the Heart of a populous Kingdom.</P>
<P>NAY, so general was this cowardly and effeminate Spirit, that it was not confined to the <HI>Friends</HI> of Liberty and <HI>Britain:</HI> In <HI>England,</HI> it infected even their <HI>Enemies:</HI> who, while the hardy <HI>Scots</HI> risqued their Lives in a strange Country, amidst the In∣clemencies of a severe Season, sat like Cowards by the Chimney Corner, tamely
<PB N="92" REF="87"/>
wishing the Success of that Mischief, which their effeminate Manners durst not propagate.</P>
<P>IT hath been urged indeed, as a Proof that the national Spirit of Defence is not yet extinguished, that we raised such large Sums during that Rebellion, and still con∣tinue such plentiful Supplies for the Support of our Fleets and Armies. This is weak Reasoning: For will not <HI>Cowardice,</HI> at least as soon as <HI>Courage,</HI> part with a Shil∣ling or a Pound, to avoid <HI>Danger?</HI> The capital Question therefore still remains, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not who shall <HI>Pay,</HI> but who shall <HI>Fight?"</HI></Q></P>
<P>MONEY, it is true, hath of late more than ever, been among <HI>us</HI> regarded as the main <HI>Engine of War:</HI> How truly, let our <HI>Successes</HI> tell the World.—This Point will
<PB N="93" REF="88"/>
hereafter be treated more at large <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Part the Third.</NOTE>. In the mean Time, it cannot be amiss to observe, that a <HI>little</HI> of the active <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Courage</HI> would do well, in order to <HI>give Play</HI> to this boasted <HI>Engine,</HI> which other∣wise may sink into a <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>unactive Mass.</HI></P>
<P>FOR a natural Display, therefore, of the Genius of the Times, commend me to the frank Declaration of an <HI>honest</HI> Gentleman, during the impending Terror of a <HI>French</HI> Invasion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For my Part, I am no <HI>Sol∣dier;</HI> and therefore think it no Disgrace, to own myself <HI>a Coward. Here</HI> is my Purse, at the Service of my Country: If the <HI>French</HI> come, <HI>I'll pay:</HI> but—take me, <HI>if I fight."</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="89"/>
HOW many modern fine Gentlemen, notwithstanding the warlike Weapon at their Side, would make the same <HI>Decla∣ration,</HI> had they the same <HI>Sincerity?</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another Circumstance in modern Manners, the Consideration of which must not be omitted because at first View it bids fair for the Spirit of De∣fence among the <HI>Great:</HI> I mean, the Spirit of <HI>deliberate Self-murder:</HI> For this ran high in ancient GREECE and ROME, when the Spirit of <HI>Defence</HI> was <HI>strong.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the clearing of this Point, it must be premised and confessed, that something <HI>like</HI> the Principle of <HI>Honour,</HI> that is, the <HI>Dread</HI> of <HI>Infamy</HI> and <HI>Shame,</HI> appears the leading Motive in both Instances.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="90"/>
BUT a farther Dictinction is to be made, with Regard to the different Objects of this <HI>Fear:</HI> And for this, we must refer to a former Section *. There we have seen, that the ruling <HI>Pride</HI> of a <HI>modern</HI> man of Fashion, lies in the Parade of <HI>Dress, Gaming, Entertainments,</HI> and <HI>Equipage:</HI> whereas, on the contrary, the <HI>Ambition</HI> of an old <HI>Roman,</HI> was, to excel in <HI>military Virtue.</HI> Now this Dictinction at once clears up the Question we are upon, and confirms much of what hath been advanced on modern Principles and Manners. The <HI>Roman</HI> killed himself, because he had been unfortunate in <HI>War;</HI> the <HI>Englishman,</HI> be∣cause he hath been unfortunate at <HI>Whist:</HI> The <HI>old</HI> Hero, because he had <HI>disgraced</HI> his <HI>Country;</HI> the <HI>modern,</HI> because he dares not shew his Head at <HI>Arthur's:</HI> That, <NOTE PLACE="foot">Part i. Sect 6.</NOTE>
<PB N="96" REF="91"/>
because he was deprived of his <HI>Glory;</HI> this, of his <HI>Ortolans</HI> and <HI>Champaigne:</HI> The first was encouraged by a <HI>mistaken</HI> Principle of Religion; the latter, by his being <HI>void</HI> of all Religion: The one, because he had lost a <HI>Battle</HI> or a <HI>Province;</HI> the other, because the Bailiff hath seized his <HI>Equipage:</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> was impelled to <HI>Self-Destruction</HI> by the Strength of <HI>warlike Honour;</HI> the <HI>Bri∣ton,</HI> by <HI>despicable</HI> and <HI>effeminate Vanity.</HI></P>
<P>WHERE then shall we seek for the ge∣nuine Spirit of Defence? Where, in Truth, should we most seek for it, but among those who are our <HI>Defenders</HI> by <HI>Profession?</HI></P>
<P>BUT, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what Probability is there, that the Spirit of Defence should be strong in any Profession, when the Members of that Profession are all chosen, without
<PB N="97" REF="92"/>
prior Culture or Preparation, from a People among whom the Spirit of De∣fence is lost?"</Q> The Truth implied in this Question is so evident in itself, that it is hard to go about to prove it. Can a mere Change of <HI>Dress</HI> or <HI>Title,</HI> or the buckling on a military <HI>Weapon,</HI> infuse Strength, Hardiness, Courage, or Honour? These are Qualities that must either be natural, which seldom happens; or they must be in∣fused by an early and continued Discipline; or else, they come not at all. Schools and Seminaries of this Kind we have none; or none that are in any Degree attended to. The young Men designed for the military Profession are bred up to the same effemi∣nate Maxims and Manners, which their Fathers are proud of: Can we wonder, if these shoot into Action, and form parallel Characters? Well might we wonder if they <HI>did not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="93"/>
SO then, if it appear by our present Success in War, that our naval and military Spirit of Defence is strong, it must be evident at the same Time, that this great Spirit is infused by some Means altogether supernatural.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, what becomes of the four great natural Hinges, on which the true Spirit of Defence must hang, <HI>Strength, Hardiness, Courage,</HI> and <HI>Prin∣ciple?</HI></P>
<P>CAN the modern System of false Deli∣cacy nerve the Warrior with Hardiness and Strength? These Qualities, I believe, are hardly <HI>boasted,</HI> as making any Part of the modern warlike Character. It is a prudent as well as a modest Part, indeed, not to throw these rough and antiquated Weights
<PB N="99" REF="94"/>
into the present military Scale: For every common Eye would detect the false Pre∣tension.</P>
<P>BUT tho' brutal Strength and unpolished Hardiness be gone, are not our <HI>Army</HI> and <HI>Navy</HI> the great <HI>Schools</HI> of <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Honour;</HI> where these shining Qualities are of Course obtained?—Truly, it hath long been so affirmed: So long, that the <HI>Affir∣mation</HI> hath, till of late, passed for <HI>Proof.</HI> But the Nation is now beginning to grow <HI>sceptical</HI> in this Point; and require some∣thing more than <HI>Affirmation,</HI> for the Sup∣port of an Article of such <HI>Importance.</HI></P>
<P>LET us first weigh the Probability of this, from the Nature of Things and Men. True <HI>Courage</HI> and a Principle of <HI>Honour,</HI> if they be not the rare and generous Growths of <HI>Nature,</HI> are the Effect of
<PB N="100" REF="95"/>
<HI>early</HI> and <HI>continued Habits.</HI> Tho' <HI>grown</HI> Gentlemen may learn to <HI>Dance;</HI> yet, their Movements will be none of the most <HI>graceful:</HI> And tho' grown Gentlemen repair to the School of Courage and Ho∣nour: yet, with all their pre-conceived Maxims of false Delicacy, their trifling Ambitions, and effeminate Manners about them, I ween, they are like to make a <HI>sorry Progress.</HI> Long before this, the Mind hath taken its <HI>decisive Cast</HI> of <HI>Thought,</HI> and can but rarely be brought back from its first <HI>Obliquities.</HI></P>
<P>BUT suppose the Possibility of this sud∣den Infusion: It is to be feared, the Con∣sequence would fail us. It is true, that when <HI>Armies</HI> take the <HI>Field,</HI> and <HI>Fleets</HI> put to <HI>Sea;</HI> when Sieges are undertaken, and Battles fought, and Glory is the Prize of Toil and Danger;—then indeed,
<PB N="101" REF="96"/>
Armies and Navies become the Schools of Courage and warlike Honour: Here is a strong and continued Bias put upon the Mind of every Individual, of Force to conquer it's earliest Obliquities. But where nothing of this happens; where <HI>Land Officers</HI> in the Capital are occupied in <HI>Dress, Cards,</HI> and <HI>Tea;</HI> and in Country Towns divide their Time between Mil∣leners <HI>Shops</HI> and <HI>Taverns;</HI> and <HI>Sea Officers,</HI> even in Time of War, instead of annoying the Enemies Fleets, are chiefly busied in the gainful Trade of catching <HI>Prizes;—</HI>in such a Case, the Army must of necessity be the <HI>School,</HI> not of <HI>Honour,</HI> but <HI>Effemi∣nacy;</HI> the <HI>Navy</HI> the School of <HI>Avarice,</HI> to the <HI>Ends of Effeminacy.</HI></P>
<P>HOW far these general Reasonings are confirmed by a Series of <HI>recent Events,</HI> the World is left to judge. It is not the
<PB N="102" REF="97"/>
Writer's Intention to make personal Ap∣plications, but to trace acknowledged <HI>Facts</HI> to their <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Consequences.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the national Spirit of Union.</HEAD>
<P>THESE accumulated Proofs may con∣vince us, that the national Spirit of <HI>De∣fence</HI> is not less weakened than the national <HI>Capacity,</HI> by the Manners and Principles of the Times. Let us next weight their various Effects on the national Spirit of <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>IT may be proper to preface this Part of the Estimate, by observing, that whereas a national <HI>Capacity</HI> and Spirit of <HI>Defence</HI> are not necessarily affected by a national Form of <HI>Government;</HI> the national Spirit of
<PB N="103" REF="98"/>
<HI>Union,</HI> on the contrary, is naturally <HI>strong</HI> under <HI>some</HI> Forms, and naturally <HI>weak</HI> under <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>IT is naturally <HI>strong</HI> in <HI>absolute Monar∣chies;</HI> because, in the Absence both of Manners and Principles, the <HI>compelling</HI> Power of the <HI>Prince</HI> directs and draws every thing to one Point; and therefore, in all common Situations, effectually sup∣plies their Place.</P>
<P>BUT in <HI>free Countries</HI> it is naturally <HI>weak,</HI> unless supported by the generous Principles of Religion, Honour, or public Spirit: For as in most Cases, a full national Union will require, that the separate and partial Views of private Interest be in some Degree sacrificed to the general Welfare; so where Principle prevails not, the national
<PB N="104" REF="99"/>
Union must ever be thwarted or destroyed by selfish Views and separate Interests.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Circumstance must be re∣marked, by which, in free Countries, the national Union will accidentally be often checked, but not destroyed: I mean, by the Freedom of <HI>Opinion</HI> itself, urged into Act by the very Strength of generous and prevailing <HI>Principle.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Distinction leads us to observe what may perhaps be deemed an Over-fight or Inaccuracy of the celebrated MONTESQUIEU. He hath often given it as his Opinion, that <HI>Factions</HI> are not only natural, but necessary to <HI>free</HI> Govern∣ments: And this general Rule he gives without Restriction. Thus he speaks of <HI>Rome.</HI> <Q LANG="fre" REND="inline margQuotes">"On n'entend parler dans les auteurs, que des divisions qui perdirent
<PB N="105" REF="100"/>
Rome: mais on ne voit pas que ces Divisions y étoient <HI>necessaires,</HI> qu'elles y avoient toujours été, &amp; qu'elles y <HI>devoi∣ent toujours etre</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grandeur des Rom. l. ix.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>How far this Proposition is <HI>true</HI> or <HI>false,</HI> the Distinction made above will lead us to discover. When the Spirit of Union is checked, and Divisions arise, from the Variety and <HI>Freedom</HI> of <HI>Opinion</HI> only; or from the contested Rights and Privileges of the different Ranks or Orders of a State, not from the detached and selfish Views of Individuals; a Republic is then in its <HI>Strength,</HI> and gathers Warmth and Fire from these Collisions. Such was the State of ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> in the simpler and more disinterested Periods of that Republic.</P>
<P>BUT when Principle is weakened and Manners lost, and Factions run high from

selfish Ambition, Revenge, or Avarice, a Repubiic is then on the very Eve of its Destruction: And such was the State of Rome, in the Times of MARIUS and SYLLA, POMPEY and CESAR, ANTHONY and AUGUSTUS.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, before we can determine whether the <HI>Factions</HI> that divide a <HI>free</HI> Country be <HI>salutary</HI> or <HI>dangerous,</HI> it is ne∣cessary to know what is their <HI>Foundation</HI> and their <HI>Object.</HI> If they arise from <HI>Free∣dom</HI> of Opinion, and aim at the public Welfare, they are <HI>salutary:</HI> If their Source be <HI>selfish</HI> Interest, of what kind soever; they are then <HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>destructive.</HI></P>
<P>IT was necessary to make these Distinc∣tions, before we could say with Precision, how far, in our own Country, a <HI>national Spirit of Union,</HI> is in reality a <HI>national</HI> GOOD.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="102"/>THE Point therefore to be examined, is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how far our national Spirit of Union is weakened or destroyed by selfish Views of Good, by separate Interests, and De∣fect of Principle?"</Q></P>
<P>Now, if the Delineation already given of our ruling Manners and Principles be true, the Consequence must needs follow, that our national Spirit of Union must be shaken by them.</P>
<P>NEITHER shall we need to cast about, for evident Facts that will confirm this Theory. Glaring Proofs will meet us at every Turn; and not only make good this Conclusion, but throw new Light on the Delineation already made.</P>
<P>THE Restraints laid on the royal Prero∣gative at the Revolution, and the Acces∣sion
<PB N="108" REF="103"/>
of Liberty thus gained by the People, produced two Effects with Respect to Par∣liaments. One was that, instead of being <HI>occasionally,</HI> they were thence-forward <HI>an∣nually</HI> assembled: The other was, that whereas on any trifling Offence given, they had been usually <HI>intimidated</HI> or <HI>dissolved,</HI> they now found themselves possessed of new <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Power;</HI> their Consent being necessary for raising the <HI>annual Sup∣plies.</HI></P>
<P>NO Body of Men, except in the simplest and most virtuous Times, ever found themselves possessed of Power, but many of them would attempt to turn it to their own private Advantage. Thus the Parlia∣ments finding themselves <HI>of Weight,</HI> and finding at the same Time that the Disposal of all <HI>lucrative Employments</HI> was vested in the <HI>Crown,</HI> soon bethought themselves,
<PB N="109" REF="104"/>
that in Exchange for <HI>their</HI> Concurrence in granting Supplies, and forwarding the <HI>Measures</HI> of <HI>Government,</HI> it was but equita∣ble that the Crown should <HI>concur</HI> in vest∣ing <HI>Them,</HI> or their <HI>Dependants,</HI> with the <HI>lu∣crative Employs</HI> of State.</P>
<P>IF this was done, the Wheels of Go∣vernment ran smooth and quiet: But if any large Body of Claimants was dissa∣tisfied, the political Uproar began; and public Measures were obstructed or over∣turned.</P>
<P>WILLIAM the <HI>third</HI> found this to be the national Turn; and set himself, like a Politician, to oppose it: He therefore si∣lenced all he could, by Places or Pensions: And hence the Origin of MAKING of PAR∣LIAMENTS.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="105"/>
BUT the Art, as yet, was but in its <HI>infant</HI> State. The ruling Principles, which had brought about the REVOLUTION, had not as yet lost their Force: And the first Es∣says of Art are always rude: Time only, and Variety of Trial and Experiment, can form them into perfect Systems.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, this new Principle of Self-Interest began to work deeper every Day in its Effects. As a Seat in Parlia∣ment was now found to be of considerable selfish Importance, the Contention for <HI>Gain,</HI> which had begun in <HI>Town,</HI> spread itself by Degrees into the <HI>Country. Shires</HI> and <HI>Burroughs,</HI> which in former Times had <HI>paid</HI> their Representatives for their At∣tendance in Parliament, were now the great Objects of <HI>Request,</HI> and <HI>political Strug∣gle.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="106"/>
AND as the <HI>Representatives</HI> had already found their Influence, and made their De∣mands on the <HI>Crown;</HI> so now, the <HI>Con∣stituents</HI> found <HI>their</HI> Influence, and made <HI>their</HI> Demands on the <HI>Representatives.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the great Chain of political Self-Interest was at length formed; and ex∣tended from the <HI>lowest Cobler</HI> in a <HI>Burrough,</HI> to the <HI>King's first Minister.</HI></P>
<P>BUT a <HI>Chain</HI> of <HI>Self-Interest</HI> is indeed no better than a <HI>Rope</HI> of <HI>Sand:</HI> There is no <HI>Ce∣ment</HI> nor <HI>Cohesion</HI> between the Parts: There is rather a mutual <HI>Antipathy</HI> and <HI>Repulsion;</HI> the Character of <HI>Self-Interest</HI> being in a pe∣culiar Sense, that of <Q REND="inline">"teres atque rotundus;"</Q> wrapt up wholly in <HI>itself;</HI> and unconnected with others, unless for its own Sake. Here then, we see even this Chain itself ready to
<PB N="112" REF="107"/>
fall in Pieces, and on any sudden Thwart or Concussion, break into an Infinity of Factions.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, the lucrative Employs of our Country not being near so numerous as the Claimants are, in every Degree of political Power and Expectation; the Spirit of selfish Faction arose of course in its Strength, from unsatisfied Demands, and disappointed Avarice.</P>
<P>IT hath much been debated, whether the Ministers or the People have contributed more to the Establishment of this System of Self-Interest and Faction. On En∣quiry it would probably appear, that at different Periods the Pendulum hath swung at large on both sides. It came down, in former Times, from the Minister to the Representative, from the Representative to
<PB N="113" REF="108"/>
the managing Alderman, from the Alder∣man to the Cobler. In later Times, the Impulse seems to have been chiefly in the contrary Direction: From the Cobler to the managing Alderman; from him, to the Member; from the Member, to the <HI>great Man</HI> who ruled the Burrough; and thence to the Minister. Thus, what was formerly, in the Minister, an Act of <HI>sup∣posed Prudence,</HI> has of late grown into an Act of <HI>supposed Necessity.</HI> The <HI>Cobler</HI> by this Time had found his <HI>Strength,</HI> so the Pressure went <HI>upwards,</HI> till it came upon the <HI>Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>To suppose that the Servants of the Crown never attempted Measures that were known to be bad, nor ever <HI>made</HI> Parliaments, in order to carry their At∣tempts into Action, would be ridiculous: But on the other hand it is equally true,
<PB N="114" REF="109"/>
what MACHIAVEL somewhere delivers as a Maxim, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That an ill-disposed Citizen can do no great Harm, but in an ill-disposed City."</Q> Bribery in the Minister supposes a corrupt People.</P>
<P>AND, to venture a plain, tho' perhaps an unpopular Truth on this Occasion; it must be owned that a Minister is not there∣fore <HI>certainly</HI> corrupt in his <HI>Intention,</HI> be∣cause he <HI>makes</HI> a Parliament by indirect and corrupt <HI>Means.</HI> This Conduct, how∣ever indefensible, may arise from two op∣posite Causes. He may be <HI>afraid</HI> of the <HI>Virtue</HI> of a Nation, in its <HI>opposing bad</HI> Measures: Or he may not dare to <HI>rely</HI> on the <HI>Virtue</HI> of a Nation, in <HI>supporting</HI> him in <HI>good ones.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was a noted Minister in this Kingdom, who, during his long Reign,
<PB N="115" REF="110"/>
seems to have put these two Maxims in Practice, as Occasion offered. For if it was his Maxim, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that every Man had his Price."</Q>It was his Maxim too, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he was obliged to bribe the Members, not to vote <HI>against,</HI> but <HI>according</HI> to their <HI>Conscience."</HI></Q></P>
<P>HOWEVER, this is not meant as a Vin∣dication of his Measures. On the con∣trary, they seem generally to have aimed no higher than to secure present Expedients, to oblige his Friends and Dependants, and provide for his own Safety. His Capacity, even when he meant well, seems to have been too narrow to comprehend any <HI>great Plan</HI> of Legislation; and perhaps his Cha∣racter might be drawn in these few Words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That while he seemed to <HI>strengthen</HI> the <HI>Superstructure,</HI> he <HI>weakened</HI> the <HI>Founda∣tions</HI> of our <HI>Constitution."</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="111"/>
BUT however defective Ministers may have been in making the public Welfare the <HI>main Object</HI> of their Views, we may be satisfied by this Estimate of Things from the <HI>Revolution</HI> to the present Times, that the Nation have at least marched <Q REND="inline">"Passibus aequis."</Q> And tho' this Work is not intended either as a Defence or an Accusa∣tion of Ministers; yet for the sake of Truth it must be said, that the eternal Clamours, of a selfish, and a factious People, against every Ministry that rises, puts one in Mind of those <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Armies, which being at once cowardly and insolent, ran away at Sight of an Enemy, and then <HI>crucified</HI> their <HI>General,</HI> because he did not gain the <HI>Victory.</HI></P>
<P>To return therefore to our Subject, (if, indeed, we have departed from it) evident
<PB N="117" REF="112"/>
it is, that the want of Principle hath at length firmly established a System of poli∣tical Self-Interest among us, which must at all times break out into Factions; and prevent the great Effects which a national Spirit of Union would produce. Former Times, we plainly see, have been fatally infected with this selfish Spirit. Present Times, <HI>in this respect,</HI> are <HI>sacred;</HI> and therefore we speak not of them. But if the ruling Manners and present want of Principle in this Kingdom be not checked in their Carriere; we must expect that fu∣ture Times will be more selfish, and there∣fore more factious, than those former ones, we have already described.</P>
<P>FOR Vanity, Luxury, and Effeminacy, (increased beyond all Belief within these twenty Years) as they are of a <HI>selfish,</HI> so are they of a craving and unsatisfied Na∣ture:
<PB N="118" REF="113"/>
The present Rage of Pleasure and unmanly Dissipation hath created a Train of new Necessities, which in their Demands outstrip every possible Supply.</P>
<P>AND if the great Principles of Religion, Honour, and public Spirit are weak or lost among us, what effectual Check can there be upon the Great, to controul their un∣bounded and unwarranted Pursuit of lucra∣tive Employments, for the Gratification of these unmanly Passions?</P>
<P>And whenever this happens, what can we expect as the Consequence, but a general Anarchy and Confusion? what, but that disappointed <HI>Avarice</HI> will kindle <HI>Faction?</HI> That national Union must be thwarted by selfish Regards? That no public Measure, however salutary, can be carried into Act,
<PB N="119" REF="114"/>
if it clash with any foreseen private In∣terest?</P>
<P>NAY, is it not the Duty of every Well-wisher to his Country, to consider, not only how soon this <HI>may be,</HI> but how far <HI>it is</HI> our present Situation?</P>
<P>WHAT other Effect can naturally arise from the Vanity, Dissipation, and Rapa∣city of a dissolute People? For in a Nation so circumstanced, 'tis natural to imagine, that next to Gaming and Riot, the chief Attention of the great World must be turned on the Business of <HI>Election-jobbing,</HI> of securing <HI>Counties,</HI> controuling, bribing, or buying of <HI>Burroughs,</HI> in a word, on the Possession of a great Parliamentary In∣terest?</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="115"/>
But what an Aggravation of this Evil would arise, should ever those of the highest Rank, tho' prohibited by Act of Parlia∣ment, insult the Laws by interfering in Elections, by solliciting Votes, or procur∣ing others to sollicit them; by influencing Elections in an avowed Defiance of their Country, and even <HI>selling</HI> vacant <HI>Seats</HI> in Parliament to the <HI>best Bidder?</HI></P>
<P>WOULD not this be a faithful Copy of degenerate and declining <HI>Rome?</HI> <Q LANG="lat" REND="inline margQuotes">"Ea de∣mum Romae libertas est, non Senatum, non Magistratus, non Leges, non Mo∣res Majorum, non Instituta Patrum ve∣reri."</Q></P>
<P>AND what, can we suppose would be the real Drift of this illegitimate Waste of Time, Honour, Wealth, and Labour? might not<PB N="121" REF="116"/>
the very Reason publickly assigned for it, be this, 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they may strengthen them∣selves and Families, and thus gain a <HI>lasting Interest</HI> (as they call it) for their Dependants, Sons and Posterity?"</Q> Now what would this imply but a supposed Right or Privilege of demanding lucrative Employs, as the chief Object of their View? And whence can this supposed Pri∣vilege of Demand derive its Force, but from a foreseen Power, and determined Purpose, of kindling Faction, and obstruct∣ing all public Measures, in case of Disap∣pointment and Disgust?</P>
<P>WE see then, how the political System of Self-Interest is at length compleated; and a Foundation laid in our Principles and Manners for <HI>endless Dissentions</HI> in the State.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="117"/>
THUS <HI>Faction</HI> is established, not on <HI>Ambition,</HI> but on <HI>Avarice:</HI> on <HI>Ava∣rice</HI> and <HI>Rapacity,</HI> for the Ends of <HI>Dissipa∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>NEED we point out particular Facts, in Confirmation of these Truths? Is not the Nation even now labouring under this fatal Malady? Is not the deadly <HI>Bow-string</HI> already stretched, and the <HI>Public</HI> gasping and expiring under the Tugs of opposed and contending Parties?</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. Of the Consequences of National Disunion.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not enough to have shewn in what Manner our Defect of Principle and ruling Manners have compleated the Ruin of the national Spirit of Union: If we would ob∣tain a full View of our Subject, it is a necessary tho' disagreeable Task, to trace this <HI>Disunion</HI> thro' its <HI>particular Effects.</HI></P>
<P>NOW these will always vary along with the Character of the People thus divided. If the Nation be <HI>warlike,</HI> and the Spirit of Defence be <HI>strong,</HI> the Danger will gene∣rally arise from <HI>within.</HI> If the Nation be <HI>effeminate,</HI> and the Spirit of Defence be <HI>weak,</HI> the Danger will generally arise from <HI>without.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="119"/>
The first of these was the Situation and Fate of the ancient Military Republics. That of <HI>Corinth</HI> was destroyed by the Fac∣tion of the <HI>Praetor</HI> DIAEUS and his Party. The <HI>Athenian</HI> Commonwealth was again and again shaken and overturned by the Weight of opposing Parties: insomuch that the History of this <HI>Republic</HI> may justly be styled the History of <HI>Faction.</HI> When de∣generate Manners had destroyed the Purity of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Constitution and Laws of LYCURGUS, AGIS attempted to restore them, but was murdered in the generous Attempt by a Faction headed by the <HI>Ephori.</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> Commonwealth, in its later Periods, was thrown into perpetual Con∣vulsions by ambitious and warlike Faction, and died at last of the Malady. And, to pass by many other Proofs that might be
<PB N="125" REF="120"/>
alledged, what Rivers of Blood have been spilt in <HI>our own Country,</HI> among contend∣ing Factions, while the Spirit of Arms and Honour remained among us?</P>
<P>BUT to give every Period of Manners it's due Character, it is confessed that in the present <HI>effeminate</HI> tho' <HI>factious</HI> Times, we have no Danger of this kind to fear. For as our Manners are degenerated into those of Women, so are our Weapons of Offence.</P>
<P>BUT as this <HI>Home-Security</HI> arises only from the common <HI>Impotence;</HI> it is probable, that other Nations may soon know of what Materials we are made; and therefore our Danger is likely to arise from <HI>without.</HI></P>
<P>LET us then examine what Effects this national Spirit of <HI>Disunion</HI> must have upon
<PB N="126" REF="121"/>
us, as we stand affected by any <HI>foreign Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>It weakens the <HI>Consistency</HI> of all public Measures: So that no great national Scheme of Thought can be carried into Action, if it's Accomplishment demands any long. Continuity of Time.</P>
<P>IT weakens not only the <HI>Consistency,</HI> but the <HI>Vigour</HI> and Expedition of all publick Measures: So that while a divided People are contending about the Means of Security or Defence, a united Enemy may sur∣prize and invade them.</P>
<P>These are the apparent Consequences of national Disunion: There is another not so obvious, and therefore more likely to be fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="122"/>
WE have seen that in a Nation circum∣stanced like <HI>ours,</HI> the great Contention among those of Quality and Fortune will probably lie in the Affair of <HI>Election In∣terests:</HI> That next to effeminate Plea∣sure and Gaming, this (for the same End as Gaming) will of Course be the capital Pursuit: that this Interest will naturally be regarded as a kind of <HI>Family-Fund,</HI> for the Provision of the younger Branches: and that it's Force must arise from this Principle, that in Case the Head of the Family is not <HI>gratified</HI> in his lucrative De∣mands, he and his Dependants will raise a <HI>Combustion</HI> in the State.</P>
<P>VIEWING the Affair, then, in this Light; we shall see that, besides the general ill In∣fluence of Faction, this Principle of Dis∣union must farther tend to weaken or de∣stroy
<PB N="128" REF="123"/>
both the National <HI>Capacity</HI> and the national Spirit of <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
<P>FOR, in a Nation so circumstanced, thro' the Strength of this Principle, many high and important Posts, in every public and important Profession, must of Course be filled by Men, who instead of <HI>Ability</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> plead this <HI>Interest</HI> for their <HI>best Title.</HI></P>
<P>THUS in a Time when Science, Capa∣city, Courage, Honour, Religion, Public Spirit, are rare; the remaining <HI>Few</HI> who possess these Virtues, will often be shut out from these Stations which they would fill with Honour; while every public and important Employ will abound with Men, whose <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> are of the <HI>newest Fashion.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis acknowledged there are Exceptions to the Truth of this Remark. Nay, were
<PB N="129" REF="124"/>
it necessary, the Writer could gratify his Vanity, by ranking some of these Names in the Number of his Friends. But not∣withstanding these Exceptions, the general Observation will maintain it's Truth.</P>
<P>How indeed can it be otherwise, while the Consciousness of this Principle has any Place in the Mind? Is not the Parliament-Interest of every powerful Family continu∣ally rung in the Ears of it's Branches and Dependants? And does not this inevitably tend to relax and weaken the Application of the young Men of Quality and Fortune, and render every Man who has Reliance on this Principle, less qualified for those Stations <HI>which</HI> BY THIS VERY PRINCIPLE he <HI>obtains?</HI> For why should a Youth of Family or Fashion (thus he argues with himself) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why should <HI>He</HI> submit to the Drudgery of Schools, Colleges, Aca∣demies,
<PB N="130" REF="125"/>
Voyages, Campaigns, Fatigues, and Dangers, when he can rise to the highest Stations by the smooth and easy Path of Parliamentary Interest?"</Q></P>
<P>'Tis granted, indeed, that the Sons and Relations of Men of Quality and Fortune, have not only an equal, but even a prior Claim to all high Employments in the State, provided only, they are <HI>qualified to fill them honourably.</HI></P>
<P>WE may truly add to this, that in that Period of a State, when Capacity, Courage, and Honour, form its ruling Character; those of high Quality and Degree, are ge∣nerally of all others the most capable, most couragious, most honourable.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, where Effeminacy and selfish Vanity form the ruling Character of
<PB N="131" REF="126"/>
a People; there we may be no less certain, that those of high Rank and Quality will in general be of all others most vain, most selfish, most incapable, most effeminate.</P>
<P>THE Reason is permanent, and the same in both Cases: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Because in every Period of every State, "the Influence of the <HI>lead∣ing People,</HI> soon or late, will form it's <HI>leading Character."</HI></Q></P>
<P>HOW far these Truths are verified by present Facts, it were <HI>needless,</HI> perhaps <HI>dangerous,</HI> particularly to say. Let it there∣fore be left to the candid Consideration of every honest and impartial Man, how far several recent Events, by which both the Honour and outward Strength of this Nation have been impaired, have arisen from the prevailing Principle here deli∣neated.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="127"/>
WE may conclude this Subject with a general Remark, which, together with the Result of these Observations, may form a general Maxim: That "when Factions arise from the Excess of military Spirit and the ambition of Dominion, they increase the national Capacity and Spirit of Defence: On the contrary, where Factions arise from selfish Effeminacy, the national Capacity and Spirit of Defence will certainly be weakened or destroyed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WE must not omit to observe, that there are two Professions which, even in the most selfish and effeminate Times, will generally maintain their pro∣per Vigour: These are the Professions of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Physic.</HI> For as their Object is the Security of the <HI>Property</HI> and <HI>Health</HI> of Individuals, the most selfish and effeminate of Mankind will always be more atten∣tive to the Preservation of <HI>these,</HI> in proportion as they are <HI>less attentive</HI> to the public Welfare, and lost to all generous Affections and Regards. Thus even in the most selfish and effeminate Times, the ablest <HI>Lawyers</HI> and <HI>Physicians</HI> will generally be at the Head of their Profession.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="128"/>
SUCH are the Effects of this prevailing Principle of Self-Interest and Disunion, in <HI>high Life.</HI> But if we take into the Account all that despicable Train of political Ma∣nagers, Agents, and Burrough-Jobbers, which hang like Leeches upon the Great, nor ever quit their Hold till they are full gorged; we shall then see this reigning Evil in it's last Perfection. For here, to Incapacity and Demerit, is generally added <HI>Insolence.</HI> Every low Fellow of this Kind looks upon the Man of Genius, Capa∣city, and Virtue, as his natural Enemy. He regards him with an evil Eye; and hence undermines or defames him; as one who thwarts his Views, questions his Title,
<PB N="134" REF="129"/>
and indangers his Expectations. He must have had little Experience in the World, who has not, among <HI>every Order,</HI> met with flagrant Characters of this Kind, and In∣stances of this Truth.</P>
<P>THUS the public Body is <HI>again</HI> weakened, or rather <HI>mutilated</HI> in all its Limbs. And that national Spirit of <HI>Disunion</HI> which our Principles and Manners have produced, comes not only attended with it's proper and <HI>immediate Effects,</HI> but hath completed the Ruin of the national <HI>Capacity,</HI> and the national Spirit of <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VI. <HI>An Objection, drawn from the Manners of the</HI> French <HI>Nation, considered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE might here close our Estimate of the public Effects of the ruling Manners
<PB N="135" REF="130"/>
and Principles of the Times; were not the Theory here established on a Number of concurrent Facts, apparently liable to an Objection.</P>
<P>THIS ariseth from the ruling Man∣ners of the <HI>French</HI> Nation: Which be∣ing as <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>effeminate</HI> as our own, and the very Archetype from which our own are drawn, should of Course involve that Nation in the same Consequences, the same Defect of national <HI>Capacity, Defence</HI> and <HI>Union:</HI> But as these Principles of na∣tional and internal Strength are, on all hands, acknowledged to maintain their proper Vigour in <HI>France,</HI> where the ruling Manners are effeminate; therefore, say the Patronizers of our modern Manners, <HI>these</HI> cannot be the Cause of our national Mis∣carriages and Defects.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="131"/>
'TIS granted, then, that their Manners are of the same Kind: But on Examina∣tion it will appear, that whereas <HI>ours</HI> (as we have seen) are suffered to go on to all their proper and natural Effects; <HI>theirs,</HI> on the contrary, are checked and counter∣acted in their Effects, by a variety of Causes and Principles wholly dissimilar.</P>
<P>THEIR effeminate <HI>Manners</HI> affect not their national <HI>Capacity,</HI> because their Youth are assiduously trained up for all public Offices, civil, naval, military, in Schools provided at the national Expence: Here the Candi∣dates for public Employ go thro' a severe and laborious Course of Discipline, and only expect to <HI>rise</HI> in <HI>Station,</HI> as they <HI>rise</HI> in <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Ability.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="132"/>
THEIR effeminate Manners affect not their national Spirit of <HI>Defence,</HI> because they are controuled by the Principle of military <HI>Honour.</HI> This, for some Ages, hath been early instilled into every rising Generation; and is at length become so strong and uni∣versal, as to form the <HI>national Character.</HI> It spreads through every Rank; inspires even the meanest in the Kingdom; and pervades and actuates the whole Machine of Government, with a Force little inferior to that of public <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>IT were no incurious Subject, to inve∣stigate this peculiar Principle to it's first Causes: But <HI>that</HI> lies beyond the Intention of the present Design. It may be called a <HI>peculiar</HI> Principle, in <HI>France,</HI> because it is <HI>unconnected,</HI> nay even at <HI>Variance</HI> with it's Manners; and in no other Country did this
<PB N="138" REF="133"/>
Principle ever subsist in it's Strength, when <HI>other</HI> Principles were <HI>weakened,</HI> and <HI>Man∣ners lost.</HI></P>
<P>IT may seem, perhaps, at first View, to have arisen from the civil Wars that rent the Kingdom in the Time of HENRY <HI>the Great,</HI> to have been transfused from thence into the gallant Reign of LOUIS, and thence heightened and delivered down to pre∣sent Times.</P>
<P>BUT tho' it received great Heighten∣ings in these two Reigns, yet it pro∣duced signal and peculiar Effects, before the first of these Periods, In Proof of this, we need only alledge the famous Route called the <HI>Battle of Spurs,</HI> when HENRY <HI>the Eighth</HI> of <HI>England</HI> invaded <HI>France.</HI> On this Occasion, the Body of the <HI>French</HI> Army giving Way thro' some sudden Panic, the Officers kept their Ground, and rather
<PB N="139" REF="134"/>
chose to be slain or taken Prisoners, than give Countenance to such an ignominious Flight.</P>
<P>THIS Principle, so remarkable at this Day among the FRENCH, <HI>we</HI> stigmatize with the Name of <HI>false Honour.</HI> Such as it is, it were to be wished we had more of it. It aims not, indeed at <HI>generous</HI> Ends, beyond a <HI>certain Sphere:</HI> But it is plausible, polite and splendid, in the Pursuit even of it's ungenerous Ends. In short, the Honour, like the Religion of <HI>France,</HI> is not <HI>void</HI> of Benevolence, but <HI>confines</HI> its Benevolence, within a <HI>certain Pale.</HI> 'Tis <HI>false</HI> Honour, as it regards <HI>other</HI> Nations; as it regards <HI>their own Country,</HI> it is <HI>true.</HI></P>
<P>As this Principle in <HI>France,</HI> secures the national Spirit of Defence, so the <HI>Power</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="135"/>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this apparent Ob∣jection, therefore, the Principles here ad∣vanced maintain their Force.

<P>THESE are the steddy Effects of <HI>their</HI> Principles and Union; of <HI>our</HI> Deficiency in <HI>both.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Causes reach to, and operate, even in the <HI>new</HI> World. <HI>Their Governors</HI> of Colonies are actuated by <HI>Honour</HI> and their <HI>Monarch's Power: Ours,</HI> too com∣monly, by <HI>Self-Love</HI> and uncontrouled <HI>Rapine.

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Of a general Mistake on this Subject.</HEAD>
<P>THE publick Effects of our Man∣ners and Principles here enume∣rated, begin now to appear too manifest in our public Miscarriages, to be any longer derided. The Nation stands aghast
<PB N="150" REF="143"/>
at it's own Misfortunes: But, like a Man starting suddenly from Sleep, by the Noise of some approaching Ruin, knows neither whence it comes, nor how to avoid it.</P>
<P>IN Proof of this, we need only look into the late Instructions from Constituents to Representatives. These, we see, seldom look farther than the immediate and incidental Occasion of each particular Misconduct: While the grand general Principles in which these Misconducts have been chiefly founded, are neither seen, nor suspected: Nay, an impartial Enquiry will probably convince us, that while they strike at the Shoots and Branches, they feed the Root from whence these Misconducts have been originally derived.</P>
<P>FOR it seems to be the ruling Maxim of this Age and Nation, that if our Trade and
<PB N="151" REF="144"/>
Wealth are but increased, we are power∣ful, happy, and secure: And in estimat∣ing the real Strength of the Kingdom, the sole Question for many Years hath been, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What Commerce and Riches the Nation is possessed of?"</Q> A Question, which an ancient Lawgiver would have laughed at.</P>
<P>THERE never was a more fatal Error more greedily embraced by any People.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>Of the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on</HI> Manners.</HEAD>
<P>BY Wealth is understood, every kind of useful Possession; or Money, which is it's Sign, and may be converted into it.</P>
<P>BY Commerce is understood the Ex∣change of Wealth, for mutual Benefit.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="145"/>
THE Effects of Commerce on Manners have by most Writers, I think, been con∣sidered as <HI>uniform.</HI> Even the sage and amiable MONTESQUIEU says only, in ge∣neral Terms, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Commerce polishes Manners, but corrupts Manners <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Esprit des Loix, l. xx. c. 1.</NOTE>."</Q> Whereas, from a candid View of it's Na∣ture and Effects, we shall probably find, that in it's first and middle Stages it is bene∣ficent; in it's last, dangerous and fatal.</P>
<P>IF we view Commerce in its first Stages, we shall see, that it supplies mutual Ne∣cessities, prevents mutual Wants, extends mutual Knowledge, eradicates mutual Pre∣judice, and spreads mutual Humanity.</P>
<P>IF we view it in its middle and more advanced Period, we shall see, it provides
<PB N="153" REF="146"/>
Conveniencies, increaseth Numbers, coins Money, gives Birth to Arts and Science, creates equal Laws, diffuses general Plenty and general Happiness.</P>
<P>IF we view it in it's third and highest Stage, we shall see it change it's Nature and Effects. It brings in Superfluity and vast Wealth; begets Avarice, gross Luxury, or effeminate Refinement among the higher Ranks, together with general Loss of Principle.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the two first Stages of Commerce, I shall have no Dispute with the present Times: It's Benefits are gene∣rally acknowledged. The dangerous Ef∣fects of it's Exorbitance or Excess have not yet been sufficiently developed.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="147"/>
THAT Commerce in it's Excess brings a general Superfluity of Goods, that this general Superfluity settles in particular Hands into vast Wealth, will be readily acknowledged.</P>
<P>THE next Step is, to consider how vast Wealth naturally produces Avarice, Lux∣ury, or Effeminacy, according to the Ge∣nius or Circumstances of the People among whom it comes.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY, in it's first Stages, is <HI>fru∣gal,</HI> not <HI>ungenerous:</HI> It's End being that of Self-Preservation and moderate Enjoy∣ment, it's little Superfluities are often em∣ployed in Acts of Generosity and Bene∣ficence. But the daily Increase of Wealth by Industry, naturally increases the <HI>Love</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="148"/>
of Wealth. The Passion for Money, be∣ing founded, not in Sense, but Imagination, admits of no Satiety, like those which are called the natural Passions. Thus the Habit of saving Money, beyond every other Habit, gathers Strength by continued Gratification. The Attention of the whole Man is immediately turned upon it; and every other Pursuit held light when com∣pared with the Increase of Wealth. Hence, the natural Character of the Trader, when his final Prospect is the Acquisition of Wealth, is that of <HI>Industry</HI> and <HI>Avarice.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is true, in this Respect, of <HI>trad∣ing Men,</HI> is true of <HI>trading Nations.</HI> If their Commerce be that of Oeconomy in the Extreme, if the last Object of their Pursuit be Wealth for it's own Sake, if the Leaders of such a People be <HI>commercial,</HI> the Cha∣racter
<PB N="156" REF="149"/>
of that People, and it's Leaders, will be found in <HI>Industry</HI> and <HI>Avarice.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if a trading Nation hath a large <HI>Territory,</HI> sufficient to create a <HI>Landed In∣terest,</HI> Commerce will produce very diffe∣rent Effects.</P>
<P>FOR as it multiplies Inhabitants, and brings in Wealth, it naturally increases the Value of landed Estates. Barren Grounds are cultivated, and cultivated Spots are made more fertile. Hence a vast Accession of Income to the Nobility and Gentry.</P>
<P>THESE Ranks of Men being not bred up to Habits of Industry; on the con∣trary, their increased Rents coming in unsought for, and their Time being often a Load upon them, thro' want of Capacity and Employment, the Habit of <HI>Indulgence</HI> comes on, and grows of Course. Addi∣tional
<PB N="157" REF="150"/>
Wealth gives the Power to gratify every Desire that rises, Leisure improves these Desires into Habits; thus Money is at length considered as no more than the Means of Gratification; and hence the genuine Character of a rich Nobility or Gentry, is that of Expence and Luxury.</P>
<P>BUT the first Essays of Luxury, like those of every other Art, are coarse and rude: The natural Character of Luxury, therefore, is to refine by Degrees: Espe∣cially, when assisted by Commerce, it ad∣vances apace into Refinement. For Com∣merce searches every Shore and Climate for it's Supplies; and Art is studious, be∣cause rewarded, in arranging and applying these Materials to the most exquisite and delicate Use. Thus every coarser Mode of Pleasure is by Degrees despised; new Habits of higher Indulgence come on:
<PB N="158" REF="151"/>
gross Luxury is banished, and Effeminacy takes it's Place.</P>
<P>BUT Luxury, in this <HI>last</HI> Period, being exhausted in it's Course; and turned, for want of new Objects of Indulgence, into Debility and Languor, would expire or sleep, were it not awakened by another Passion, which again calls it into Action. Nothing is so natural to effeminate Minds, as <HI>Vanity.</HI> This rouzes the lux∣urious and debilitated Soul; and the Arts of pleasurable Enjoyment are now pushed to their highest Degree, by the Spirit of delicate Emulation.</P>
<P>THUS the whole Attention of the Mind is centred on <HI>Brillancy</HI> and <HI>Indulgence:</HI> Money, tho' despised as an <HI>End,</HI> is greedily sought as a <HI>Means:</HI> And <HI>Self,</HI> under a dif∣ferent
<PB N="159" REF="152"/>
Appearance from the trading Spirit, takes equal Possession of the Soul.</P>
<P>THUS as the Character of a State altoge∣ther commercial in the highest Degree, is that of Industry and Avarice; so, in a Nation of extended Territory, where Com∣merce is in it's highest Period, while it's trading Members retain their Habits of Industry and Avarice, the natural Charac∣ter of it's landed Ranks, it's Nobility and Gentry, is that of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a vain, luxurious, and selfish Effeminacy."</Q></P>
<P>WE speak here of the simple and proper Effects of Trade and Wealth, uncontrouled by opposite Manners or Principles; which, it is to be observed, never existed probably, at least in the mixed State, in their full Ex∣tent: Individuals there are, and will be, in almost every State and Period, who are
<PB N="160" REF="153"/>
influenced by dissimilar Manners or Prin∣ciples: There are Traders who are gene∣rous; Nobles and Gentry whose ultimate Passion is for Gold: But such Exceptions affect not the general Principle: And tho' these incidental Mixtures <HI>Weaken</HI> the diffe∣rent Colours of different Ranks or States, yet still the different Colours remain in their Nature distinct and invariable.</P>
<P>'TIS probable, the Reader will have dis∣covered, that this Reasoning is strengthened by, or rather built upon, the Examples of two neighbour Nation; one wholly com∣mercial, that of <HI>Holland:</HI> The other a mixed State, compounded of a commer∣cial and landed Interest; I mean <HI>our own.</HI> And to say the Truth; no two Nations perhaps ever existed, which approached so near to the full and proper Effects of the Causes here alledged.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="154"/>
IT will appear immediately why the Genius of the Republic of <HI>Holland</HI> is here analysed into its first Principles; which are simply, those of Industry and the Love of Gain.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, we may justly conclude from this Argument, that the exorbitant Trade and Wealth of <HI>England</HI> sufficiently account for it's present <HI>Effemi∣nacy.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth, on the religious Principle.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH therefore are the ruling Manners which may naturally be expected in a Na∣tion thus circumstanced, unless they be
<PB N="162" REF="155"/>
counteracted by opposite Principles: 'Tis now Time to consider the natural Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth, on all those salutary Principles by which these effeminate Manners can most effectually be controuled.</P>
<P>LET us still carry the two characteristic States of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> in our Eye.</P>
<P>WHETHER, then, we view the com∣mercial State, where the Love of Money rules; or the mixed State, where vain Effeminacy predominates; we shall find both these national Characters have but a bad Aspect and Influence on every Kind of Principle. Let us first consider that of Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="156"/>
AVARICE seems not, in it's own Nature, prone to destroy <HI>speculative</HI> religious Be∣lief; but effectually to extinguish <HI>active</HI> religious Principle.</P>
<P>IT tends not to destroy speculative Be∣lief, because this Effect must be a Work of Application, Time, and Labour: Now the Labour of Avarice is naturally bent on it's main Object, <HI>Money;</HI> therefore, to waste this Labour on the Propagation of the unprofitable and fruitless Doctrines of Irreligion, must ever be contrary to it's ruling Character.</P>
<P>BUT Avarice naturally tends to the De∣struction of active religious Principles; be∣cause this is chiefly a Matter of <HI>habitual Impression;</HI> and therefore, in order to ac∣complish it's Destruction, nothing more is
<PB N="164" REF="157"/>
necessary than to <HI>forget.</HI> Now this re∣quires no positive Act or Labour of the Mind, but is the natural Result from an attentive Pursuit of the favourite Object, <HI>Money.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE, in a mere commercial State, actuated by the Love of Gain, Religion is not railed at or disputed against, but only <HI>neglected</HI> and <HI>forgot.</HI> And thus, the <HI>genuine Trader,</HI> who never questioned the Articles of his national Faith at home, scruples not to forswear <HI>Christianity,</HI> and tread upon the Cross in <HI>Japan,</HI> and returns the same good <HI>Christian</HI> as he went.</P>
<P>BUT in the mixed State, where national Effeminacy forms the <HI>primary,</HI> and Avarice only the <HI>secondary</HI> Character, the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on religious Principle, will be widely different.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="158"/>
LORD <HI>VERULAM</HI> hath somewhere observed, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Times of Atheism are civil Times."</Q>He had been much nearer the Truth, had he affirmed, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Civil Times are Times of Atheism."</Q> He mistook the Cause for the Effect.</P>
<P>THIS Effect of national Luxury and Re∣finement, in producing national Irreligion, is not difficult to account for. In some Periods of a State, Opinions controul Man∣ners; but in most Periods, Manners con∣troul'Opinions. Where the ruling Man∣ners coincide with the common Good, as in the middle Periods of a State, there we commonly find that a rational and bene∣ficent System of Religion prevails: This comes to pass, because the Principles of the received Religion contradict not the ruling Manners.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="159"/>
BUT in the State and Period of Luxury or Refinement, active religious Principle is lost thro' the attentive Pursuit of <HI>Pleasure;</HI> as in the commercial State, it is lost thro' the attentive Pursuit of <HI>Gain.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>speculative</HI> Belief, in this Period, must naturally be lost along with <HI>practical;</HI> because <HI>Leisure</HI> and <HI>Literature</HI> having opened the Field of <HI>Disputation,</HI> Vice as well as Virtue will of course arm herself with every Weapon of Preservation and Offence. Luxury therefore will generally list under the Banner of Irreligion; because Religion condemns her Manners; Irreli∣gion suffers, or approves them.</P>
<P>To confirm the Truth of this Reasoning, we need only observe, that in the Period of refined Luxury, <HI>few</HI> but they who are in∣volved
<PB N="167" REF="160"/>
in the <HI>Vices,</HI> are involved in the <HI>Irreligion</HI> of the Times.</P>
<P>ONE Exception, however, must be made, with Regard to the <HI>Writers</HI> against Religion. For <HI>these,</HI> though they <HI>promote,</HI> yet are not often <HI>involved</HI> in the common Degeneracy. This Fact hath been re∣garded as unaccountable: that <HI>sober</HI> Men of Morals apparently <HI>unblameable,</HI> should madly unhinge the great Principle of Reli∣gion and Society, without any visible Mo∣tive or Advantage. But by looking a little far∣ther into human Nature, we shall easily resolve this seeming Paradox. These Writers are generally Men of Speculation and Indus∣try; and therefore though they give them∣selves up to the Dictates of their ruling Passi∣on, yet that ruling Passion commonly leads to the Tract of <HI>abstemious</HI> Manners. That Desire of <HI>Distinction</HI> and <HI>Superiority,</HI> so na∣tural
<PB N="168" REF="161"/>
to Man, breaks out in a thousand va∣rious and fantastic Shapes, and in each of these, according as it is directed, becomes a Virtue or a Vice. In Times of Luxury and Dissipation therefore, when every Tenet of Irreligion is greedily embraced, what Road to <HI>present Applause</HI> can lie so open and secure, as that of disgracing religious Belief? Espe∣cially if the Writer help forward the Vices of the Times, by <HI>relaxing Morals,</HI> as well as <HI>destroying Principle.</HI> Such a Writer can have little else to do, but to new model the Para∣doxes of ancient <HI>Scepticism,</HI> in order to <HI>figure it</HI> in the World, and be regarded by the Smat∣terers in Literature and Adepts in Folly, as a Prodigy of Parts and Learning. Thus his <HI>Vanity</HI> becomes deeply criminal, and is ex∣ecrated by the Wise and Good, because it is gratified at the Expence of his Country's Wel∣fare. But the <HI>Consolation</HI> which degenerate Manners receive from his fatal Tenets, is
<PB N="169" REF="162"/>
repaid by eager <HI>Praise:</HI> And <HI>Vice</HI> impati∣ently drinks in and <HI>applauds</HI> his hoarse and boding Voice, while like a <HI>Raven,</HI> he sits croaking universal Death, Despair, and Annihilation to the human Kind.</P>
<P>THUS, where Manners and Religion are opposed, nothing is so natural, as that the <HI>one</HI> should bear down the <HI>other.</HI> If Reli∣gion destroy not the ruling Manners, <HI>these</HI> will gather Strength, and destroy Reli∣gion.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY, in a Country where Free∣dom is established, and Manners lost through the Exorbitance of Wealth, the Duration of religious Principles can be but short. Despotism arms itself with Terror; and by checking the open and avowed <HI>Profession,</HI> checks in a certain Degree the <HI>Progress</HI> of <HI>Impiety.</HI> Whereas it must be
<PB N="170" REF="163"/>
acknowledged and lamented, as one of the unalterable Defects of a free Government, that <HI>Opinion</HI> must have its Course. The Disease is bad; but the Cure would be fa∣tal. Thus Freedom is compelled to admit an <HI>Enemy,</HI> who under the Pretence and Form of an <HI>Ally,</HI> often proves her <HI>De∣stroyer.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on the Principle of Honour.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mixed State, where Luxury and Effeminacy form the ruling Character of a People, the Excess of Trade and Wealth naturally tends to weaken or destroy the Principle of <HI>Honour,</HI> by fixing the Desire of Applause, and the Fear of Shame, on im∣proper and ridiculous Objects. Instead of the Good of others, or the Happiness of
<PB N="171" REF="164"/>
the Public, the Object of Pursuit naturally sinks into some unmanly and trifling Cir∣cumstance: The Vanity of Dress, Enter∣tainments, Equipage, Furniture, of course takes Possession of the Heart.</P>
<P>BUT in the pure commercial State, where the Love of Gain predominates among the higher Ranks, the Desire of Applause and Fear of Shame are not <HI>perverted,</HI> but <HI>ex∣tinguished.</HI> The Lust of Gold swallows up every other Passion: and a Nation of this Character can without Emotion stand the Laughter and Contempt of <HI>Europe,</HI> and say with the Miser,</P>
<Q LANG="lat"><L>Populus me sibilat; at mihi plaudo</L>
<L>Ipse Domi, simulac Nummos contemplor in Area.</L></Q>
<P>IN whatever Shape, therefore, the Passi∣on for Applause appear, whether it assume
<PB N="172" REF="165"/>
the fantastic Form of Vanity, the more so∣lemn one of Pride, or the steady and elevated Desire of rational Esteem; we shall find this Excess of national Avarice tends to its Extinction. A great Writer indeed hath told us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vanity creates Industry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Esprit des Loix, l. xix. l. 9.</NOTE>;"</Q> which is true: Notwith∣standing this, we have seen above, that Industry in the Excess naturally begets Avarice; and Avarice in the Excess works a total Change in the Soul, and expels that Vanity which gave it birth.</P>
<P>THE same great Writer hath told us, <Q REND="inline">"that Pride destroys Industry <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>;"</Q> the Re∣verse of which holds equally true: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Industry destroys Pride:"</Q> We speak here of Pride in the blameable Sense, as when it riseth into blind and overbearing <HI>Insolence.</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="166"/>
Industry in the moderate Degree tends to destroy this contemptuous Spirit, by intro∣ducing Knowledge and Equality: and in this Respect, as in most others, is attended with excellent Effects.</P>
<P>BUT the Spirit of Trade in its Excess, by introducing Avarice, destroys the De∣sire of <HI>rational Esteem.</HI> In Confirmation of this, we need only cast our Eyes on the HOLLANDERS and CHINESE, among whom the trading Spirit is almost in its unmixed Perfection: The one is the most <HI>mercenary,</HI> the other the most <HI>thieving</HI> of all Nations.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. Of their Effects on public Spirit.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Part of our Subject needs little In∣vestigation. For both in the commercial
<PB N="174" REF="167"/>
and mixed State, it appears, that exorbi∣tant Trade and Wealth tend naturally to turn all the Attention of Individuals on <HI>selfish</HI> Gratification.</P>
<P>THEREFORE they must of course gene∣rally tend to destroy the Principle of pub∣lic Spirit: because <HI>this</HI> implies, that our Attention and Regard is turned on <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>IN the commercial State, Avarice repre∣sents <HI>Wealth,</HI> in the mixed State Effemi∣nacy represents <HI>Pleasure,</HI> as the <HI>chief Good.</HI> Both these Delusions tend to the Extincti∣on of public Spirit.</P>
<P>THESE Delusions create a new Train of Wants, Fears, Hopes, and Wishes: All these terminating in selfish Regard, natu∣rally destroy every Effort of generous and public Principle.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<PB N="175" REF="168"/>
<HEAD>SECT. VI. Farther Remarks on this Subject.</HEAD>
<P>IN Consequence of these Remarks, some farther Distinctions will arise.</P>
<P>THUS, the religious Principle will <HI>seem</HI> to exist in the commercial State, where Avarice forms the national Character; while in the mixed State where Luxury and Effe∣minacy predominate, it is evidently destroy∣ed. The Reason is, that in the first, al∣though active Principle is lost, speculative Belief is not controverted: Whereas, in the latter, not only active Principle is lost, but Religion itself (if such a State be free) is publickly insulted and derided. Thus in <HI>Holland,</HI> Religion <HI>seems</HI> yet to exist; while in <HI>England</HI> it is evidently destroyed.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="169"/>
ON the contrary, the Principle of Ho∣nour will seem to exist in the mixed State, where luxurious Effeminacy forms the pri∣mary Character of the Nation; while in the commercial State, where Avarice pre∣dominates, the Principle is evidently no more. The Reason is, that in the for∣mer, the Love of Applause and Fear of Shame are not wholly destroyed, but per∣verted, and turned upon unworthy Objects; while in the latter, the Passion itself is to∣tally extinguished. Thus the faint Appear∣ance of Honour yet remains in <HI>England,</HI> while in <HI>Holland</HI> it is manifestly destroyed.</P>
<P>BUT as modern <HI>Dutch</HI> Religion, and modern <HI>English</HI> Honour, seem no more than the Ghosts of departed Principles, so they have precisely those Effects, which
<PB N="177" REF="170"/>
may reasonably be expected from such shadowy Non-Entities.</P>
<P>AGAIN: The Colours or Characters of Industry and Avarice will naturally be <HI>strong</HI> in the commercial State: because, being almost wholly unmixed with Man∣ners of a dissimilar Nature, the ruling Ge∣nius of the State is left uncontrouled, to its proper Operations and Effects.</P>
<P>BUT in the mixed State, where Indu∣stry and Love of Gain form the Character of the <HI>secondary</HI> Ranks; Dissipation and Effeminacy, of the <HI>higher;</HI> there the two separate Characters, by the Force of inci∣dental Coalition and Example, will always influence each other in a certain Degree. Some ambitious Traders will aspire to lux∣urious Effeminacy: Some, of the higher Orders, will descend to Industry and Mer∣chandise.
<PB N="178" REF="171"/>
Thus each Rank must be tinc∣tured with a Colour different from its own; and hence, the general Colour or Cha∣racter of each of these Ranks, will, in some measure be controuled and <HI>weak∣ened.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Circumstance is favourable to the mixed State, beyond that which is purely commercial; as it checks in a certain De∣gree the Virulence of the Excess; and pro∣duceth a national Character in some Mea∣sure approaching that of more moderate Trade and Wealth.</P>
<P>HENCE too it follows, that a State purely commerical, when once arrived at the Pe∣riod of exorbitant Wealth, will naturally degenerate <HI>faster</HI> than that which is com∣pounded of Commerce and Luxury. For whatever Causes check the ruling Man∣ners
<PB N="179" REF="172"/>
in their <HI>Degree,</HI> will check them in their <HI>Consequences.</HI></P>
<P>BUT beyond this, there is another Rea∣son, why the State purely commercial will degenerate faster than the mixed State. In the commercial State, the ruling Manners go Hand in Hand with the Exorbitance of Wealth; because the Love of Gain, which forms the leading Character, being like∣wise the leading Motive, must be even prior to this Exorbitance in the Order of our Ideas; and therefore, in its Effects, must be at least contemporary.</P>
<P>BUT in the mixed State, there will al∣ways be a short Period between the nati∣onal Exorbitance of Wealth, and the nati∣onal Increase of luxurious Effeminacy: be∣cause Manners, once got into a certain Track, are not at once thrown out of it.
<PB N="180" REF="173"/>
There must be a short Period, before the leading Parts of the Nation can <HI>feel</HI> their Increase of Wealth; and after this, ano∣ther Period, before new and more refined Modes of Pleasure can be invented.</P>
<P>HENCE a neighbouring Republic seems to have well nigh filled up the Measure of its Iniquities; while <HI>ours,</HI> as yet, are only rising towards the <HI>Brim.</HI></P>
<P>LASTLY; though the ruling Manners of such a mixed State are luxurious and effeminate, yet its public Measures will be <HI>commercial.</HI> First, because Commerce is the Hand-Maid of <HI>Wealth,</HI> and therefore of <HI>Pleasure.</HI> Secondly, because the Idea of national Strength as well Happiness be∣ing degenerated into that of Wealth and external Good, Commerce will above all Things be naturally encouraged, because it is the Means of procuring them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. A Review of the Argument.</HEAD>
<P>THUS our present exorbitant Degree of Trade and Wealth, in a mixed State like that of <HI>England,</HI> naturally tends to produce luxurious and effeminate Manners in the higher Ranks, together with a general De∣fect of <HI>Principle.</HI> And as the internal Strength of a Nation will always depend chiefly on the Manners and Principles of it's leading Members, so these effeminate Manners and this Defect of Principle ope∣rate powerfully, and fatally, on the na∣tional Conduct and Affairs. They have pro∣duced a general Incapacity, have weaken∣ed the national Spirit of Defence, have heightened the national Disunion: And this national Disunion, besides it's proper and immediate Effects, being founded in
<PB N="182" REF="175"/>
Avarice for the Ends of Dissipation, hath again weakened the small Remainder of publick Capacity and Defence; and thus seems to have fitted us for a Prey to the Insults and Invasions of our most powerful Enemy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VIII. An Objection considered.</HEAD>
<P>THO' this Estimate may appear <HI>just</HI> to those who take an enlarged View of Things in their Principles and Consequences; yet I am not ignorant of certain Maxims, ge∣nerally approved, and hardly even disputed among modern Politicians, which if true, would weaken or overturn these accumu∣lated Proofs.</P>
<P>THE capital Maxim, which seems to in∣clude the rest, is this; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That vast Trade
<PB N="183" REF="176"/>
and Wealth, above all things make a Nation powerful and invincible, as they increase it's Numbers, enable it to pay it's Fleets and Armies, provide conti∣nual Supplies for War; and thus, in the End, tire out and defeat every Enemy, whose Wealth and Commerce are in∣ferior."</Q></P>
<P>THE Examination of this Maxim will throw many strong collateral Lights upon our main Subject.</P>
<P>First it affirms, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Trade and Wealth make a Nation strong, because they make it populous."</Q> This indeed is true of the first and second Periods of Trade and Wealth: That it is true of the <HI>third</HI> or <HI>highest</HI> Period, of which <HI>England</HI> is now possessed, may very reasonably be questi∣oned. In the first Period, Industry is chiefly
<PB N="184" REF="177"/>
employed in cultivating the Lands, in en∣creasing, manufacturing, and exchanging the Produce of the Mother Country. These Branches of Trade call for vast additional Numbers of Hands; and hence an Increase of Numbers naturally ariseth.</P>
<P>THE same Effect takes Place in the second Period of Trade; so far as home Productions are <HI>exchanged</HI> for foreign ones. This Stage of Commerce brings on a fresh Demand of Artificers of new and various Kinds, produces and In∣crease of Labour, and therefore of Inha∣bitants.</P>
<P>BUT in the third or highest Period of Trade, of which <HI>England</HI> is now possessed, there are very extensive Branches of Com∣merce, which bring no new Accession of Numbers to the Commonwealth. I mean,
<PB N="185" REF="178"/>
all those Branches of Commerce, where <HI>Money</HI> is sent and exchanged for <HI>foreign</HI> Goods. This Species of Trade occasions little Increase of <HI>Labour,</HI> and therefore less of <HI>Numbers;</HI> except only of those few who navigate the Vessels thus employed, to their respective Ports. And as this kind of Trade will always grow and predominate, in proportion as a Nation becomes more luxurious and effeminate, so for this Rea∣son the highest Stage of Trade is not natu∣rally attended with the highest Increase of Labour, nor consequently of <HI>Numbers,</HI> as is commonly imagined. Besides this, in the refined Period, additional Art and Ex∣perience in Labour prevent, in some Mea∣sure, the Increase of Numbers. By the Invention of Machines, an equal Degree both of Tillage and Trade is carried on by fewer Hands, than in the simpler Periods; and therefore the Increase of Numbers is
<PB N="184" REF="179"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="185" REF="180"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="186" REF="181"/>
by no means proportional to the Increase of Commerce and Wealth.</P>
<P>BUT these are far from being the only Considerations worth our Notice on this Subject. For when we speak of any Stage of Trade, we must in Reason take in <HI>every</HI> Circumstance which naturally attends it. There are other Causes, therefore, why Numbers increase not, but rather naturally <HI>diminish,</HI> in the highest Period of Trade and Wealth.</P>
<P>FOR <HI>first,</HI> the Vanity and Effeminacy which this exorbitant Pitch of Wealth brings on, lessens the Desire of Mar∣riage.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> the Intemperance and Disease which this Period of Trade naturally pro∣duceth among the <HI>lower Ranks</HI> in great
<PB N="187" REF="182"/>
Cities, bring on in some Degree an Im∣potence of Propagation.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This Debility is always attended with a Shortness of Life, both in the Pa∣rents and the Offspring; and therefore a still farther Diminution of Numbers fol∣lows on the whole.</P>
<P>MATTER of Fact confirms these Rea∣sonings; and lies open to every Man's Ob∣servation. Since the first Increase of Til∣lage and Home-manufactures, the Increase of Inhabitants hath been great in <HI>England:</HI> Since the vast Increase of foreign Com∣merce, the Increase of Numbers is hardly perceivable. Nay, there is great Reason to believe, that upon the whole, the Nation is less populous than it was fifty Years ago, tho' it's Trade perhaps is doubled. Some trading Towns indeed are better
<PB N="188" REF="183"/>
peopled, but others are thinned by the Flux of Commerce. The Metropolis seems to augment in its Dimensions: But it appears, by the best Calculations, that it's Numbers are diminished; And as to the Villages thro' <HI>England,</HI> there is great Reason to believe, they are in general at a Stand, and many of them thinner of Inhabitants than in the Beginning of this Century. 'Tis hard to obtain Cer∣tainty in this Particular, without a ge∣neral Examination and Comparison. But it appears by the Registers of some <HI>Coun∣try</HI> Parishes, which I have looked into, that from the Year 1550 to 1710, the Number of Inhabitants increased gra∣dually; the two Extremes being to each other, as 57 to 72; and that from 1710 to the present Time, the Number has been at a Stand, if not rather dimi∣nished.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="184"/>
BUT suppose, what there is no Reason to believe, that our present Excess of Trade and Overflow of Wealth have in some Degree increased our <HI>Numbers,</HI> yet it will probably appear, that they have as much, at least, impaired our <HI>bodily Strength.</HI> For as <HI>Temperance</HI> is the rul∣ing Character of the middle Stage of Commerce, so is <HI>Intemperance</HI> of the highest. Hence, Health and Strength prevail in the first; Disease and Debility in the latter. This is universally confirmed by Fact: Villages abounding with Health; commercial Cities with Disease. So that an Army taken from the Villages, with equal Commanders, Arms, and Discipline, would drive the same Number of debili∣tated Gin-drinkers, like a Flock of Geese before them.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="185"/>
THE Author of the <HI>Fable of the Bees</HI> made his Boast, that the Wisdom of the Legislature had, upon his Plan, adopted the Encouragement of this pernicious Li∣quid: But the same Wisdom hath upon Trial been obliged to <HI>discourage</HI> the Use of this malignant Spirit; as they found that it ruined the Health, and shortened the Lives, of half the lower Ranks in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>AND all good Men hope, that the Time will come, when this infernal Potion will be laid under such Discouragements, as may amount to a general Prohibition. The Necessity of such a Reformation grows greater every Day, not only in <HI>London,</HI> but throughout the Kingdom. For in some Villages in <HI>England</HI> there is now a greater Quantity of Gin consumed than of Ale.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="186"/>
BUT to quit these inferior Considera∣tions, tho' they all unite in confirming the Theory here advanced; the Weight of the Reply lies indeed in another Circumstance: For altho' we should admit (what is not true) that our present Exorbitance of Trade and Wealth increased our Numbers and bodily Force, yet as the real and essen∣tial Strength of a Nation consists in the Manners and Principles of it's <HI>leading Part;</HI> and as our present Excess of Trade and Wealth hath produced such fatal Effects on these Manners and Principles; no In∣crease of Numbers in the inferior Ranks can possibly make amends for this internal and capital Defect. Such a Nation can, at best, only resemble a large <HI>Body,</HI> actuated (yet hardly actuated) by an incapable, a vain, a dastardly, and effeminate <HI>Soul.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="187"/>
BUT the Maxim we are engaged to ob∣viate, alledges farther, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This exor∣bitant Increase of Trade and Wealth enables a Nation to pay it's Fleets and Armies, and afford continual Sup∣plies for War."</Q> Yet, even this Part of the Maxim, in it's modern Acceptation, is far beyond the Truth.</P>
<P>FOR under the present Stage of Trade, the Increase of Wealth is by no means equally or proportionally diffused: The Trader reaps the main Profit: after him, the Landlord, in a lower Degree: But the common Artificer, and still more the common Labourer, gain little by the exorbitant Advance of Trade: It is true, their Wages are increased; but so are the Prices of Provisions too: and therefore they are no richer than before.
<PB N="193" REF="188"/>
Now Taxes and public Supplies are raised upon the Consumer: and as it appears from hence, that only a few of the Con∣sumers are made richer by the Exorbitance of Trade, it follows, that not the Nation in general, but a select Number of Indi∣viduals only, are made more capable of contributing to those Supplies, which are levied without Distinction on the <HI>whole.</HI> Would they who reap the plenteous Harvest of foreign Trade, generously allot their proportional and extraordinary Gains to the Service of the Public, we should then indeed be furnished with a <HI>new</HI> Argument in Fa∣vour of Commerce in it's highest Pitch.</P>
<P>FARTHER: As the labouring Ranks are little or nothing enriched by the exorbitant Degree of Trade, so it often happens that even the higher Ranks, and the Nation in general, are not <HI>more,</HI> nay perhaps <HI>less</HI> en∣abled
<PB N="194" REF="189"/>
to contribute to the public Supplies, than when possessed of Wealth in a more moderate Degree. For we have seen, in the Progress of this Estimate, that the na∣tural Effect of an Increase of Wealth, is an Increase of Luxury, Vanity, and Ex∣pence; which, if it outrun the Increase of Wealth, as in it's Nature it tends to do, instead of Riches will bring on public Po∣verty. For the Ability or Wealth of a People, considered in their Capacity for raising Supplies, consists not in the Large∣ness of their Income, but in the Proportion of their Expences to their Income: It consists not in <Q REND="inline">"what they <HI>have,"</HI></Q> but <Q REND="inline">"what they can <HI>Spare?"</HI></Q> Hence it ap∣pears, that a Nation may be at once very <HI>rich,</HI> and very <HI>poor;</HI> rich in Income, but poor thro' Extravagance. And as national Extravagance is the natural Effect of an Overflow of Wealth, so national Indigence
<PB N="195" REF="190"/>
is it's most natural and final Consequence. How far this is our present Situation, can hardly be necessary to affirm.</P>
<P>To this Argument it may possibly be objected, that if great Wealth is but among us, new Imposts will naturally <HI>force</HI> it into Circulation: That the more the Artificers and Labourers are taxed, the more their Wages will increase, and consequently their Ability to bear the in∣creasing Taxes: And that as to the higher Ranks, exorbitant Wealth <HI>enables</HI> them still better to endure additional Imposts, because these deprive the Great of nothing but the Superfluities of Vanity and Luxury.</P>
<P>To this it is replied, that in Case of additional Taxes, tho' the Poor <HI>must</HI> indeed increase their Wages in order to subsist, yet this Increase never takes Place, till
<PB N="196" REF="191"/>
they are compelled by the last <HI>Necessity</HI> and <HI>Want:</HI> The natural Consequence of which must be Murmurs, Sedition, and Tumults. With Regard to the higher Ranks, a parallel Reply may suffice: For in the refined Period, when Manners and Principles are lost, the Luxuries of Life become <HI>Necessaries</HI> among the Great; and therefore will be as obstinately adhered to, and quitted with the same Reluctance, as Food and Cloathing by the <HI>Poor.</HI> The Consequence therefore must be the same; a general Discontent and Disaffection to the Government, among the higher Ranks of Life.</P>
<P>IS not all this confirmed by evident Facts; There is at present in this Nation a Mass of Wealth at least twelve Times more than the publick Debt: Yet we are reduced to the sad Necessity of plunging
<PB N="197" REF="192"/>
deeper every Day. What is the Reason? No Ministry dares to provoke and exasperate a luxurious and selfish Nation, by demand∣ing such Sums, as every one has the <HI>Power</HI> had he but the <HI>Will,</HI> to bestow.</P>
<P>BUT beyond all this, will any Man of Sense assert, that the Circumstance of <HI>pay∣ing</HI> an Army or a Fleet, is the one thing that will decide a War? 'Tis true, indeed, Pro∣visions, Arms, Ammunition are necessary; and therefore <HI>Wealth,</HI> because it procures them. But will a General or Admiral therefore gain the Victory, only because his Men are furnished with Provisions, Arms, and Ammunition? If not, what can Trade or Wealth do, towards making a Nation victorious? Again, therefore, let me re∣mind my Countrymen, that the capital Question still remains, not <Q REND="inline">"who shall <HI>pay,"</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">"but who shall <HI>fight?"</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="193"/>
THERE is a trite Observation on Foot, indeed, drawn from the best political Wri∣ters ill understood, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Principles of War are wholly changed; and that not the Nation who has the best <HI>Troops,</HI> but the longest <HI>Purse,</HI> will in the End ob∣tain the Victory."</Q> This, in the mo∣dern Application of it, is a most dan∣gerous Maxim. It naturally tends to extinguish military Skill, as well as Hon∣our: and will inevitably sink the People that maintains it, into a Nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of defense∣less and Money-getting Cowards.</P>
<P>IT must be confessed that Doctor DA∣VENANT, the most able Writer on these Subjects, hath affirmed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That now, the whole Art of War is in a Manner re∣duced to Money; and now-a-days, that Prince who can best find Money to
<PB N="199" REF="194"/>
feed, cloath, and pay his Army, not he that hath the most valiant Troops, is surest of Success and Conquest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ways and Means, p. 27. v. ii. p. 13.</NOTE>."</Q> This Declaration, which is now stolen and retailed for new, by every modern Dab∣ler in Politics, has had the usual Fortune of these kind of Thefts, to be misunderstood: as may appear from the general Tenor of the Doctor's Writings. To shew this, two Instances, out of many may suffice. Even when speaking on the Benefits of foreign Trade, he warns us, as if he had foreseen all that has befallen, or is likely to befall us. For he says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If a trading and rich People are grown soft and luxurious, their Wealth will invite over to them Invaders from Abroad, and their being <HI>effeminate</HI> will make the Conquest easy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dav. on Trade,</NOTE>."</Q> And
<PB N="200" REF="195"/>
again, in Terms yet stronger: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In suc∣ceeding Times our Manners may come to be depraved; and when this happens, all Sorts of Miseries will invade us: The whole Wealth of the Kingdom will not be sufficient for it's Defence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 317.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THUS, what he and other sensible Writers have affirmed under proper Re∣strictions, and upon Supposition that a Nation maintained it's Manners and Prin∣ciples, is now advanced absolutely, and without Restriction, as if Manners and Principles, military and naval Skill and Courage, had no Part, or at least no essen∣tial Part, in the Success of War.</P>
<P>THESE shallow Politicians, therefore, might well be put in Mind of the Maxim of a warlike Prince, when his Ministers
<PB N="201" REF="196"/>
dissuaded him from attacking a wealthy Enemy, because he wanted Money to pay his Troops: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My Enemies, said he, are rich, luxurious, and effeminate; my Troops are valiant and hardy; my Offi∣cers brave and honourable; they shall plant <HI>my</HI> Standard in my Enemy's Country, and then <HI>my Enemy shall pay them."</HI></Q></P>
<P>WE have lately seen this military Con∣duct followed by a brave King, in the Elec∣torate of <HI>Saxony:</HI> We ourselves have for∣merly pursued it on the Plains of <HI>Agin∣court</HI> and <HI>Cressi:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> are now pur∣suing it on the Plains of <HI>America:</HI> And if we hold to our dastardly Maxim, they will pursue it on the Plains of <HI>Salisbury.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the boasted modern Maxim which we proposed to obviate, seems void of
<PB N="202" REF="197"/>
Truth in every Branch of it: As it appears from this View, that without the internal Strength which Manners and Principles produce, the most exorbitant Trade and Wealth can never be the Foundation of a successful War; or give us any rational Prospect, either of <HI>Victory</HI> or <HI>Self-De∣fence.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IX. Another Objection considered.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH then are the natural Effects of ex∣orbitant Trade and Wealth, unless coun∣teracted by opposite Manners or Principles. The History of our own Nation would confirm these Truths in a most striking and particular Manner, were it within the proposed Limits of this Estimate, to enter so large a Field of Enquiry. We should there see, that Manners and Principles
<PB N="203" REF="198"/>
have always prevailed, and baffled the most sanguine Attempts of Wealth, when set in Competition with them. This System would be found supported by a vast Va∣riety of Events, from the Reign of <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> to the present Times. But this might perhaps be regarded as a Research rather curious than necessary; since a single Re∣flection on the present State of the King∣dom may seem to stand in the Place of a thousand Proofs.</P>
<P>AT present, therefore, we shall not touch on this Enquiry; but rather proceed to remove another Objection, which may seem to overturn the Theory here proposed.</P>
<P>FOR it is urged, that <HI>France</HI> is an Ex∣ception to the Truth of these Remarks: inasmuch as, in the midst of a large and extensive Commerce, which brings in a
<PB N="204" REF="199"/>
vast Accession of Wealth, she stills retains her Principles and Power.</P>
<P>THE Fact objected is true: but the Consequence follows not; because the Trade of <HI>France</HI> is limited and controuled by such Accidents, as prevent it's most dangerous and ruinous Effects on Govern∣ment</P>
<P>THE <HI>Poverty</HI> of its <HI>Noblesse</HI> or leading Ranks, who are often possessed of sound∣ing Titles without any Realities annexed, as it prevents them from reaping that In∣crease of Wealth which naturally ariseth to a rich Landed Gentry from an Increase of Commerce, so it naturally drives them to the Profession of <HI>Arms,</HI> as the necessary Means of Support: This strengthens and supports their Monarchy; which, finding it's Advantage from this Disposition to
<PB N="205" REF="200"/>
Arms, naturally gratifies this military Spi∣rit in it's <HI>Noblesse,</HI> and gives it Exercise and Encouragement by frequent Wars.</P>
<P>HENCE the national Spirit of the <HI>French Noblesse</HI> hath long been military, in the highest Degree.</P>
<P>WITH Regard to Commerce, it's Growth in <HI>France</HI> hath been but late: Meeting therefore with this established Spirit of Arms in the leading Ranks, it hath not as yet been able to controul it. Commerce indeed is encouraged; but so encouraged, as not to destroy the leading Principle of their Monarchy. To this End, the Ranks of the Kingdom are kept essentially distin∣guished; and while the People are allured to Trade by every Kind of Motive, the <HI>Noblesse</HI> or Gentry are, in Honour, prohi∣bited from Commerce. It was indeed
<PB N="206" REF="201"/>
formerly proposed in <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>Noblesse</HI> should be drawn down to Trade: But, whether thro' deep and consummate Policy, or thro' the Principle of Honour itself, working blindly for it's own Preser∣vation, the dangerous Proposal was <HI>weakly</HI> or <HI>wisely</HI> rejected. Whenever this Over∣ture meets with Acceptance and Success, tho' it may seem for a while to give Vigour to their State, yet from that Period we may date the Downfall of <HI>France.</HI> Their effeminate Manners, now controuled by <HI>Oeconomy</HI> and the Love of <HI>Glory,</HI> will, like ours, degenerate into <HI>Profusion</HI> and the Love of <HI>Gold.</HI></P>
<P>ON the contrary; Trade, tho' encouraged, is by the ruling Principle of this great Mo∣narchy, kept within it's proper Limits; and while the Merchant traverseth Seas in Pursuit of <HI>Gain,</HI> the Gentleman does the
<PB N="207" REF="202"/>
same in Pursuit of <HI>Glory.</HI> Thus the two incompatible Provinces are kept distinct; and hence, while the <HI>French</HI> vie with us in <HI>Trade,</HI> they tower above us in <HI>Principle.</HI></P>
<P>NAY their very trading Settlements among foreign Nations are actuated by this ruling Principle in such a Manner, as to give a Splendor to their Monarchy and Commerce in the most barbarous Cli∣mates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numerous Proofs might be given of this: At present it may suffice to take one from a very fine Book lately published. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is usual among the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> to shew an extreme Respect for their Consul. In order to make him more considerable in the Eyes of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and of the other Nations, they endeavour to give an high Idea of his Person, and to illustrate his Birth in such a Manner, that it is not their Fault, if he is not considered as issued from the Blood Royal. If by Chance he take a Tour to <HI>Rosetto,</HI> he carries a white Flag at the Mast of his Pinnace; and when he goes out of the Port, as likewise when he re∣turns into it, he is saluted by a general Discharge of the Cannon of the <HI>French</HI> Vessels."</Q> <BIBL>NORDEN'S Travels in <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Nubia,</HI> Vol. i. p. 29.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus, while <HI>we</HI> are poorly in∣fluenced by a sorry and mercantile Maxim,
<PB N="208" REF="203"/>
first broached by a trading Minister,<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the <HI>Interest</HI> of a Nation is it's <HI>truest</HI> Honour;"</Q>the <HI>French</HI> conduct themselves on an oppo∣site and higher Principle, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the <HI>Ho∣nour</HI> of a Nation is its truest Interest."</Q></P>
<P>IN Confirmation of what is here ad∣vanced, we need only cast our Eyes on the Fortune and Fate of <HI>France,</HI> during the present Century. In the last War, she was exhausted, tho' victorious: in the former, she was both beaten and exhausted: In both these Instances, it was weakly thought by every superficial Politician in <HI>England,</HI> that because we had exhausted the Men
<PB N="209" REF="204"/>
and Money, we had destroyed the Power of <HI>France.</HI> Experience hath told us the Reverse: The Spirit of Honour and Union working at the Root, soon restored those Branches that War had swept away, and have at length shot them into their former Vigour and Luxuriancy.</P>
<P>HENCE then, we may learn an impor∣tant Truth: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no incidental Events can make a Nation <HI>little,</HI> while the Principles remain that made it <HI>great."</HI></Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. X. The Conclusion</HEAD>
<P>FROM these accumulated Proofs, then it seems evident, that our present effeminate Manners and Defect of Principle have arisen from our exorbitant Trade and Wealth, left without Check, to their na∣tural
<PB N="210" REF="205"/>
Operations and uncontrouled Influ∣ence. And that these Manners, and this Defect of Principle, by weakening or de∣stroying the national Capacity, Spirit of Defence, and Union, have produced such a general Debility as naturally leads to De∣struction.</P>
<P>WE might now proceed to confirm these Reasonings, by Examples drawn from History. For there is hardly an ancient or modern State of any Note recorded in Story, which would not in one Respect or other, confirm the leading Principles on which this Argument is built.</P>
<P>IN these, throughout their several Periods, we should see <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Wealth,</HI> or (what is in this respect equivalent) <HI>Conquest</HI> and <HI>Opulence,</HI> taking their Progress: At one Period, polishing
<PB N="211" REF="206"/>
and strengthening; at another, refin∣ing, corrupting, weakening, destroying, the State that gave them Entrance: Working indeed in different Ways, and under a Variety of Appearances; by Ava∣rice, by Faction, by Effeminacy, by Pro∣fligacy; by a Mixture and Combination of all these Evils: sometimes dividing a Na∣tion against itself; at others, quelling it's Spirit, and leaving it an easy Prey to the first Invader: Sometimes checked by a rising Patriot, or counterworked by national Misfortunes: In one Country corrupting Manners; in another, Principles; in a third, both Manners and Principles: ren∣dering one People blind, another cowardly, another treacherous to itself: Stealing se∣cretly and insensibly on one Nation; over∣whelming another in sudden Destruc∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="207"/>
BUT to enlarge on these Subjects in that vague and undistinguishing Manner, which most Writers have pursued in treating them, tho' it might carry the <HI>Appearance</HI> of Rea∣soning, would in Truth be no more than <HI>Declamation</HI> in Disguise. And to develope and unravel the Particularity of Causes and Effects, thro' all their Variety of Combina∣tion and mutual Influence, as it would ex∣tend this Estimate beyond it's designed Limits, must be left to make a Part of some future Enquiry.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Character, Effects,</HI> and <HI>Sources</HI> of our Manners and Principles, being thus laid open, the Writer had it in his Thoughts to have proceeded to the Consideration of <Q REND="inline">"their most practicable Remedies."</Q> But as the Closet-<HI>Projects</HI> of retired and specu∣lative Men, often <HI>are,</HI> and always are <HI>re∣guarded,</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="208"/>
as <HI>chimerical;</HI> he was therefore un∣willing, at present, to hazard the Discredit of such an Attempt.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, lest his Attempt should be deemed more visionary than perhaps it is, he judged it not improper to hint at some of the leading Principles on which it is built. And with this View, the following Reflections are submitted to the Conside∣ration of the Public.</P>
<P>THE World has been long amused with a trite and hacknied Comparison between the Life of Man, and that of States; in which it is pretended that they both pro∣ceed in the same irrevocable Manner; from Infancy to Maturity, from Maturity to Death: A Comparison, perhaps as groundless as it is common. The human Body contains, in its very Texture, the
<PB N="214" REF="209"/>
Seeds of certain Dissolution. That is, tho' you set aside all the possible Accidents arising from Intemperance, from the In∣fluence of the Elements, the Climate, and every other external and contingent Cause the human Frame itself, after a certain Period, would grow into Rigidity; the Fluids would decrease, the Solids accumu∣late, the Arteries <HI>ossify,</HI> the Blood stagnate, and the Wheels of Life stand still.</P>
<P>BUT in Societies, of whatever Kind, there seems no such necessary or essential Tendency to Dissolution. The human Body is <HI>naturally</HI> mortal; the political, only so by <HI>Accident:</HI> Internal Disorders or Diseases may arise; External Violence may attack or overpower: but these Causes, tho' always to be expected, are wholly in∣cidental: the first is precisely of the same Nature as Intemperance, the second as
<PB N="215" REF="210"/>
the Influence of the external Elements, on the human Body. But there appears no∣thing in the internal Construction of any State, that tends inevitably to Dissolution, analogous to those Causes in the human Frame, which lead to certain Death.</P>
<P>THIS Observation seems confirmed by History: Where you see States, which, after being sunk in Corruption and Debility, have been brought back to the Vigour of their first Principles: But you must have recourse to Fables, for medicated Old Age, restored to Infancy or Youth.</P>
<P>IF this be true, it seems not altogether chimerical, tho' confessedly difficult, to bring about the Reformation of a State. To lay down general Rules, in such a Case, would be like giving a <HI>Panacea;</HI> the very
<PB N="216" REF="211"/>
<HI>Empiricism</HI> of Politics. The Remedies must be suited to the Disease.</P>
<P>WE have seen, that the ruling Evils of our Age and Nation have arisen from the unheeded Consequences of our Trade and Wealth. That these have produced effeminate Manners, and occasioned Loss of Principle: That these have brought on a national Debility. But would the les∣sening this exorbitant Trade and Wealth bring back Manners and Principles, and restore the Nation's Strength?—I very much Question the Event.</P>
<P>BUT whatever the Consequences might be at <HI>Home,</HI> those <HI>Abroad</HI> would certainly be fatal. The <HI>French</HI> are every Day gain∣ing upon us in Commerce; and if ours should lessen, theirs would increase to our Destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="212"/>
THUS are we fallen into a kind of Di∣lemma: If our Commerce be maintained or increased, its Effects bid fair to destroy us: If Commerce be discouraged and les∣sened, the growing Power of our Enemy threatens the same Consequence.</P>
<P>THERE seems, then, no other Expe∣dient than this, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Commerce and Wealth be not discouraged in their <HI>Growth;</HI> but checked and <HI>controuled in their Effects."</HI></Q></P>
<P>AND even in attempting this, Care must be had, lest in controuling the Effects of Commerce, we should destroy Commerce itself.</P>
<P>WE see how strongly the natural Effects of Trade and Wealth, are controuled in
<PB N="218" REF="213"/>
<HI>France,</HI> by proper Checks and counteract∣ing Principles: Yet mere Imitation is always a narrow, and often an ineffectual Scheme. Besides, as our Constitution is of a superior Nature, so our Manners and Principles must be adapted to it, ere it can obtain it's proper Strength.</P>
<P>THE Virtues yet left among us, and enumerated above <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Part I. Sect. 2, 3, 4.</NOTE>, may be a possible Foundation for such a Change.</P>
<P>THERE are two different Kinds of Re∣medies, which might in due Time be ap∣plied. The first are radical, general, and lasting: The latter, palliative, particular, and temporary.</P>
<P>THE first seem totally impracticable at <HI>present:</HI> For as they suppose a Change of
<PB N="219" REF="214"/>
Manners and Principles, this may justly be regarded as an impossible Event, during the present Age; and rather to be wished than hoped for, in the next.</P>
<P>THE palliative, particular, and tempo∣rary Remedies, may seem more practicable at this Juncture. I mean, those which are of the coercive Kind; which work by opposed Passions, or by destroying the Opportunities or Occasions of Evil. Where the ruling Mischiefs lie among the People, these Remedies, with proper Care, may easily be administered. Thus we have lately seen the salutary Effects of a new Kind of Police, established by a use∣ful Magistrate in the City of <HI>London;</HI> by which, the reigning Evil of <HI>Street-Robberies</HI> hath been almost wholly suppressed; altho' we may reasonably suppose, the Disposition towards them remains as strong as ever.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="215"/>
BUT where the ruling Mischief desolates the Great, there, even the palliative Re∣medies cannot easily be applied: The Rea∣son is manifest: A coercive Power is wanting: They who should cure the Evil are the very Delinquents: And moral or political Physic is what no distempered Mind will ever administer to itself.</P>
<P>NECESSITY therefore, and <HI>Necessity alone,</HI> must in such a Case be the Parent of Reformation. So long as degenerate and unprincipled Manners can support them∣selves, they will be deaf to Reason, blind to Consequences, and obstinate in the <HI>long</HI> established Pursuit of <HI>Gain</HI> and <HI>Plea∣sure.</HI> In such Minds, the Idea of a Public has no Place; and therefore can never be a Curb to private Gratification: Nor can such Minds be ever awakened from their
<PB N="221" REF="216"/>
fatal Dream, till either the Voice of an abused People rouse them into Fear; or the State itself totter, thro' the general Incapacity, Cowardice, and Disunion of those who should support it.</P>
<P>WHENEVER this compelling Power, <HI>Necessity,</HI> shall appear; then, and not till then, may we hope that our Deliverance is at hand. Effeminacy, Rapacity, and Faction, will then be ready to resign the Reins they would now usurp: One com∣mon Danger will create one common In∣terest: Virtue may rise on the Ruins of Corruption; and a despairing Nation yet be saved, by the Wisdom, the Integrity, and unshaken Courage, of SOME GREAT MINISTER.</P>
