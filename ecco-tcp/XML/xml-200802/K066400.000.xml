<HEAD>ELEGY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AGAIN that funeral knell?—'tis Death's deep toll,</L>
<L>And Rutland is no more!—the general groan,</L>
<L>The gush of grief from sorrow's inmost soul,</L>
<L>Sound the last summons—He's for ever gone!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="4"/>
<L>Nor youth, nor titles ranged in proud array,</L>
<L>Nor loftiest lineage, high as kings may go;</L>
<L>Nor a whole people's prayer, have power to stay</L>
<L>The mortal malady's malignant blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such, in this pilgrimage of earthly cares,</L>
<L>For many a short sojourner the sad sigh.</L>
<L>Fate's formidable ordinance declares</L>
<L>The best are born to suffer and to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But while thro' all her sons Hibernia mourns</L>
<L>The statesman dead, the friend, companion lost,</L>
<L>In Britain, in his native Britain, burns</L>
<L>No generous breast to hail his honour'd ghost?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<L>For never from its mournful mansion forth,</L>
<L>Went one more honour'd to the realms above;</L>
<L>And yet not nobler in exalted worth,</L>
<L>Than gracious gifts of courtesy and love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah, melancholy thought!—the general groan</L>
<L>Of heart-felt horror thro' a people spread,</L>
<L>In one sad mourner center'd, all in one,</L>
<L>Soon shall burst over a lov'd husband dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dead, ere his hour, by too severe a fate,</L>
<L>In the full prime of life's meridian bloom;</L>
<L>His ardent spirits high with hope elate</L>
<L>Of many a joy, in many a year to come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
<L>Ill-destin'd youth! nor year, alas, hast thou,</L>
<L>Nor joy to come, from this devoted day.</L>
<L>Transient thy morn of glory, as the bow</L>
<L>That blazons heav'n's blue arch, and fades away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so the sorrows a fond consort pours!</L>
<L>Sorrows!—but who may paint what passeth shew?</L>
<L>With what diviner inspiration's powers</L>
<L>An angel's agonies unfold to view?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such, (and the funeral harbinger draws near)</L>
<L>Such, as when fate's irrevocable doom</L>
<L>On her lov'd Lord assails her fear-full ear,</L>
<L>Pale now and cold in night's eternal gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
<L>What heart, with Shakspear's fire, would firmness have</L>
<L>To ponder on those moments, when Despair</L>
<L>Its ghastly semblance on that face shall grave,</L>
<L>Fairer than Fancy's pencil could make fair?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To hear that voice, that 'witch'd the list'ning soul</L>
<L>With more than musick, all discordant broke;</L>
<L>In thrilling plaints, disdainful of controll,</L>
<L>Calling on cruel Death, whose ruthless stroke</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Kill'd all her hopes?—"You sunk him to the tomb,</L>
<L>"Remorseless Death! you sped the dart, (she cries;)</L>
<L>"Ere I to catch the parting breath could come,</L>
<L>"Press his pale lips, and close his dying eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
<L>"He's gone! the bright star that illum'd my sky!</L>
<L>"Discolour'd now with dim'd and loathsome light.</L>
<L>"Where e'er I turn, no gleam of comfort nigh;</L>
<L>"'Tis silence all, and solitude, and night!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Now never more, the lonely hour to cheer,</L>
<L>"Shall he be seen; to read the wistful eye;</L>
<L>"Hear inward anguish sigh'd to Passion's ear,</L>
<L>"Sooth'd only by re-murm'ring Passion's sigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"No, he's for ever gone! friend, husband, all,</L>
<L>"For which in this waste world I long'd to live.</L>
<L>"Vainly to me its vain enchantments call;</L>
<L>"Nought have I now to ask, or that to give;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
<L>"Then let what may take all!"—Ah, Lady, still,</L>
<L>Something remains, sad Lady; still too dear!</L>
<L>When Passion's ruffled gale hath blown its fill,</L>
<L>Oh, there's a tender call still claims thy care!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A husband's last fond pledges of his love;</L>
<L>His and your love, for ever left behind.</L>
<L>And shall such pledges ineffectual prove?</L>
<L>Such melting motives on a mother's mind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too hapless Lady! no.—Each lenient art</L>
<L>To lighten their distress, that love will try;</L>
<L>Silence the throbbings of a bleeding heart,</L>
<L>And be to them their parent in the sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
<L>So, like some flower, (if with prophetic view</L>
<L>The poet's eye may glance on days to come)</L>
<L>Like some spring-flower, reviv'd from noxious dew,</L>
<L>Shall that bright form, emerging from the gloom</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of blank Misfortune's frown, with vivid glow</L>
<L>Again bloom forth; with roseat smiles again</L>
<L>Feel Health's gay spirits animated flow,</L>
<L>And once more lead the loves' and graces' train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such the warm hope of all, whose souls e'er dwelt</L>
<L>On the fair wonder of that heav'nly face;</L>
<L>Felt for such grief as only can be felt,</L>
<L>Which ev'n the muse herself wants pow'r to trace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
<L>Oh, then forgive the meanest of her train;</L>
<L>To Rutland or to Fame how lightly known;</L>
<L>Who touch'd by sympathy, in artless strain,</L>
<L>Presumes with her laments to mix his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But born alike into a world of woe,</L>
<L>Insensibly we form the feeling breast;</L>
<L>Humanity heav'n sends to high and low,</L>
<L>The beggar and the king, a common guest.</L>
