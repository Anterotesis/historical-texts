<HEAD TYPE="sub">SELIM; OR, THE SHEPHERD'S MORAL.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SCENE, A VALLEY NEAR BAGDAT. TIME, THE MORNING.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>YE Persian maids, attend your Poet's lays,</L>
<L>And hear how shepherds pass their golden days,</L>
<L>Not all are blest, whom Fortune's hand sustains</L>
<L>With wealth in courts, nor all that haunt the plains;</L>
<L>Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell;</L>
<L>'Tis virtue makes the bliss where'er we dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>Thus Selim sung, by sacred Truth inspir'd;</L>
<L>Nor praise, but such as Truth bestow'd, desir'd:</L>
<L>Wise in himself, his meaning songs convey'd</L>
<L>Informing morals to the shepherd maid;</L>
<L>Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find,</L>
<L>What groves nor streams bestow, a virtuous mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When sweet and blushing, like a virgin bride,</L>
<L>The radiant morn resum'd her orient pride,</L>
<L>When wanton gales along the vallies play,</L>
<L>Breathe on each flower, and bear their sweets away:</L>
<L>By Tygris' wandering waves he sat, and sung</L>
<L>This useful lesson for the fair and young.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Persian dames, he said, to you belong,</L>
<L>Well may they please, the morals of my song:</L>
<L>No fairer maids, I trust, than you are found,</L>
<L>Grac'd with soft arts, the peopled world around!</L>
<L>The morn that lights you, to your loves supplies</L>
<L>Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes:</L>
<L>For you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow,</L>
<L>And yours the love that kings delight to know.</L>
<L>Yet think not these, all beauteous as they are,</L>
<L>The best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair!</L>
<L>Who trust alone in Beauty's feeble ray,</L>
<L>Boast but the worth <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The gulph of that name, famous for the pearl fishery.</NOTE> Balsora's pearls display;</L>
<L>Drawn from the deep we own their surface bright,</L>
<L>But, dark within, they drink no lustrous light:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Such are the maids, and such the charms they boast,</L>
<L>By sense unaided, or to virtue lost.</L>
<L>Self-flattering sex! your hearts believe in vain</L>
<L>That Love shall blind, when once he fires the swain;</L>
<L>Or hope a lover by your faults to win,</L>
<L>As spots on ermin beautify the skin;</L>
<L>Who seeks secure to rule, be first her care</L>
<L>Each softer virtue that adorns the fair;</L>
<L>Each tender passion man delights to find</L>
<L>The lov'd perfection of a female mind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest were the days, when Wisdom held her reign,</L>
<L>And shepherds sought her on the silent plain;</L>
<L>With Truth she wedded in the secret grove,</L>
<L>Immortal Truth, and daughters bless'd their love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O haste, fair maids! ye Virtues come away,</L>
<L>Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way!</L>
<L>The balmy shrub for you shall love our shore,</L>
<L>By Ind excell'd or Araby no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lost to our fields, for so the Fates ordain,</L>
<L>The dear deserters shall return again.</L>
<L>Come thou, whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear,</L>
<L>To lead the train, sweet Modesty, appear:</L>
<L>Here make thy court amidst our rural scene,</L>
<L>And shepherd-girls shall own thee for their queen.</L>
<L>With thee be Chastity, of all afraid,</L>
<L>Distrusting all, a wise suspicious maid;</L>
<L>But man the most—not more the mountain doe</L>
<L>Holds the swift salcon for her deadly foe.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Cold is her breast, like flowers that drink the dew;</L>
<L>A silken veil conceals her from the view.</L>
<L>No wild desires amidst thy train be known,</L>
<L>But Faith, whose heart is fix'd on one alone:</L>
<L>Desponding Meekness, with her down-cast eyes,</L>
<L>And friendly Pity, full of tender sighs;</L>
<L>And Love the last: by these your hearts approve,</L>
<L>These are the virtues that must lead to love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus sung the swain; and ancient legends say,</L>
<L>The maids of Bagdat verified the lay:</L>
<L>Dear to the plains, the Virtues came along,</L>
<L>The shepherds lov'd, and Selim bless'd his song.</L>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">HASSAN; OR, THE CAMEL-DRIVER.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SCENE, THE DESERT. TIME, MID-DAY.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>IN silent horror o'er the boundless waste</L>
<L>The driver Hassan with his camels past:</L>
<L>One cruise of water on his back he bore,</L>
<L>And his light scrip contain'd a scanty store;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
A fan of painted feathers in his hand,</L>
<L>To guard his shaded face from scorching sand.</L>
<L>The sultry sun had gain'd the middle sky,</L>
<L>And not a tree, and not an herb was nigh;</L>
<L>The beasts, with pain, their dusty way pursue,</L>
<L>Shrill roar'd the winds, and dreary was the view!</L>
<L>With desperate sorrow wild, th' affrighted man</L>
<L>Thrice sigh'd, thrice struck his breast, and thus began:</L>
<L>" Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>" When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! little thought I of the blasting wind,</L>
<L>The thirst or pinching hunger that I find!</L>
<L>Bethink thee, Hassan, where shall thirst asswage,</L>
<L>When fails this cruise, his unrelenting rage?</L>
<L>Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign;</L>
<L>Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear</L>
<L>In all my griefs a more than equal share!</L>
<L>Here, where no springs in murmurs break away,</L>
<L>Or moss-crown'd fountains mitigate the day,</L>
<L>In vain ye hope the green delights to know,</L>
<L>Which plains more blest, or verdant vales bestow:</L>
<L>Here rocks alone, and tasteless sands are sound,</L>
<L>And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around.</L>
<L>" Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>" When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Curst be the gold and silver which persuade</L>
<L>Weak men to follow far-fatiguing trade!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
The lilly peace outshines the silver store,</L>
<L>And life is dearer than the golden ore:</L>
<L>Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown,</L>
<L>To every distant mart and wealthy town.</L>
<L>Full oft we tempt the land, and oft the sea;</L>
<L>And are we only yet repay'd by thee?</L>
<L>Ah! why this ruin so attractive made,</L>
<L>Or why fond man so easily betray'd?</L>
<L>Why heed we not, while mad we haste along,</L>
<L>The gentle voice of Peace, or Pleasure's song?</L>
<L>Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side,</L>
<L>The fountain's murmurs, and the valley's pride,</L>
<L>Why think we these less pleasing to behold</L>
<L>Than dreary deserts, if they lead to gold?</L>
<L>" Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>" When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O cease, my fears!—all frantic as I go,</L>
<L>When thought creates unnumber'd scenes of woe.</L>
<L>What if the lion in his rage I meet!—</L>
<L>Oft in the dust I view his printed feet:</L>
<L>And fearful! oft, when Day's declining light</L>
<L>Yields her pale empire to the mourner Night,</L>
<L>By hunger rous'd, he scours the groaning plain,</L>
<L>Gaunt wolves and sullen tygers in his train;</L>
<L>Before them Death with shrieks directs their way,</L>
<L>Fills the wild yell, and leads them to their prey.</L>
<L>" Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>" When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<L>At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep,</L>
<L>If aught of rest I find, upon my sleep:</L>
<L>Or some swoln serpent twist his scales around,</L>
<L>And wake to anguish with a burning wound.</L>
<L>Thrice happy they, the wise contented poor,</L>
<L>From lust of wealth, and dread of death secure!</L>
<L>They tempt no deserts, and no griefs they find;</L>
<L>Peace rules the day, where reason rules the mind.</L>
<L>" Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>" When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O hapless youth! for she thy love hath won,</L>
<L>The tender Zara will be most undone;</L>
<L>Big swell'd my heart, and own'd the powerful maid,</L>
<L>When fast she dropt her tears, as thus she said:</L>
<L>" Farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain,</L>
<L>" Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain!</L>
<L>" Yet as thou go'st, may every blast arise,</L>
<L>" Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs!</L>
<L>" Safe o'er the wild, no perils may'st thou see,</L>
<L>" No griefs endure, nor weep, false youth, like me."</L>
<L>O let me safely to the fair return,</L>
<L>Say with a kiss, she must not, shall not, mourn;</L>
<L>O! let me teach my heart to lose its fears,</L>
<L>Recall'd by Wisdom's voice, and Zara's tears.</L>
</LG>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ABRA; OR, THE GEORGIAN SULTANA.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SCENE, A FOREST. TIME, THE EVENING.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>IN Georgia's land, where Tefflis' towers are seen,</L>
<L>In distant view along the level green,</L>
<L>While evening dews enrich the glittering glade,</L>
<L>And the tall forests cast a longer shade,</L>
<L>What time 'tis sweet o'er fields of rice to stray,</L>
<L>Or scent the breathing maize at setting day;</L>
<L>Amidst the maids of Zagen's peaceful grove,</L>
<L>Emyra sung the pleasing cares of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of Abra first began the tender strain,</L>
<L>Who led her youth with flocks upon the plain:</L>
<L>At morn she came, those willing flocks to lead</L>
<L>Where lillies rear them in the watery mead:</L>
<L>From early dawn the live-long hours she told,</L>
<L>'Till late at silent eve she penn'd the fold.</L>
<L>Deep in the grove, beneath the secret shade,</L>
<L>A various wreathe of odorous flowers she made:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">That these flowers are found in very great abundance in some of the provinces of Persia; see the Modern History of the ingenious Mr. Salmon.</NOTE> Gay motley'd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose,</L>
<L>The violet blue that on the moss-bank grows;</L>
<L>All-sweet to sense, the flaunting rose was there:</L>
<L>The finish'd chaplet well adorn'd her hair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great Abbas chanc'd that fated morn to stray,</L>
<L>By love conducted from the chace away:</L>
<L>Among the vocal vales he heard her song,</L>
<L>And sought the vales and echoing groves among:</L>
<L>At length he found, and wooed the rural maid;</L>
<L>She knew the monarch, and with fear obey'd.</L>
<L>" Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd,</L>
<L>" And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The royal lover bore her from the plain;</L>
<L>Yet still her crook and bleating flock remain:</L>
<L>Oft as she went, she backward turn'd her view,</L>
<L>And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu.</L>
<L>Fair happy maid! to other scenes remove,</L>
<L>To richer scenes of golden power and love!</L>
<L>Go leave the simple pipe, and shepherd's strain;</L>
<L>With love delight thee, and with Abbas reign.</L>
<L>" Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd,</L>
<L>" And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet midst the blaze of courts she fix'd her love</L>
<L>On the cool fountain, or the shady grove;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Still with the shepherd's innocence her mind</L>
<L>To the sweet vale, and flowery mead inclin'd;</L>
<L>And oft as Spring renew'd the plains with flowers,</L>
<L>Breath'd his soft gales, and led the fragrant Hours,</L>
<L>With sure return she sought the sylvan scene,</L>
<L>The breezy mountains, and the forests green.</L>
<L>Her maids around her mov'd, a duteous band!</L>
<L>Each bore a crook all-rural in her hand:</L>
<L>Some simple lay, of flocks and herds, they sung;</L>
<L>With joy the mountain and the forest rung.</L>
<L>" Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd,</L>
<L>" And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And oft the royal lover left the care</L>
<L>And thorns of state, attendant on the fair;</L>
<L>Oft to the shades and low roof'd cots retir'd,</L>
<L>Or sought the vale where first his heart was fir'd:</L>
<L>A russet mantle, like a swain, he wore,</L>
<L>And thought of crowns and busy courts no more.</L>
<L>" Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd,</L>
<L>" And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest was the life that royal Abbas led:</L>
<L>Sweet was his love, and innocent his bed.</L>
<L>What if in wealth the noble maid excel;</L>
<L>The simple shepherd girl can love as well.</L>
<L>Let those who rule on Persia's jewell'd throne,</L>
<L>Be fam'd for love, and gentlest love alone;</L>
<L>Or wreathe, like Abbas, full of fair renown,</L>
<L>The lover's myrtle with the warrior's crown.</L>

<L>Each swain was blest, for every maid was kind;</L>
<L>At that still hour, when awful midnight reigns,</L>

<L>By turns they felt the glowing mind</L>
<L>Disturb'd, delighted, rais'd, refin'd.</L>
<L>Till once, 'tis said, when all were fir'd,</L>
<L>Fill'd with fury, rapt, inspir'd,</L>
<L>From the supporting myrtles round</L>
<L>They snatch'd her instruments of sound,</L>
<L>And as they oft had heard apart</L>
<L>Sweet lessons of her sorceful art,</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="44"/>
Each, for madness rul'd the hour,</L>
<L>Would prove his own expressive power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First Fear his hand, its skill to try,</L>
<L>Amid the chords bewilder'd laid,</L>
<L>And back recoil'd he knew not why,</L>
<L>Even at the sound himself had made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next Anger rush'd, his eyes on fire,</L>
<L>In lightnings own'd his secret stings,</L>
<L>In one rude clash he struck the lyre,</L>
<L>And swept with hurried hand the strings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With woeful measures wan Despair</L>
<L>Low sullen sounds his grief beguil'd,</L>
<L>A solemn, strange, and mingled air,</L>
<L>'Twas sad by fits, by starts 'twas wild.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But thou, O Hope, with eyes so fair,</L>
<L>What was thy delighted measure?</L>
<L>Still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure,</L>
<L>And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!</L>
<L>Still would her touch the strain prolong,</L>
<L>And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,</L>
<L>She call'd on Echo still thro' all the song;</L>
<L>And where her sweetest theme she chose,</L>
<L>A soft responsive voice was heard at every close,</L>
<L>And Hope enchanted smil'd, and wav'd her golden hair.</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="45"/>
And longer had she sung,—but, with a frown,</L>
<L>Revenge impatient rose,</L>
<L>He threw his blood-stain'd sword in thunder down,</L>
<L>And, with a withering look,</L>
<L>The war- denouncing trumpet took,</L>
<L>And blew a blast so loud and dread,</L>
<L>Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe.</L>
<L>And ever and anon he beat</L>
<L>The doubling drum with furious heat:</L>
<L>And tho' sometimes, each dreary pause between,</L>
<L>Dejected Pity at his side,</L>
<L>Her soul-subduing voice applied,</L>
<L>Yet still he kept his wild unalter'd mien,</L>
<L>While each strain'd ball of sight seem'd bursting from his head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fix'd,</L>
<L>Sad proof of thy distressful state,</L>
<L>Of differing themes the veering song was mix'd,</L>
<L>And now it courted Love, now raving call'd on Hate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With eyes up-rais'd, as one inspir'd,</L>
<L>Pale Melancholy sat retir'd,</L>
<L>And from her wild sequester'd seat,</L>
<L>In notes by distance made more sweet,</L>
<L>Pour'd thro' the mellow horn her pensive soul:</L>
<L>And dashing soft from rocks around,</L>
<L>Bubbling runnels join'd the sound;</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="46"/>
Thro' glades and glooms the mingled measure stole,</L>
<L>Or o'er some haunted streams with fond delay,</L>
<L>Round an holy calm diffusing,</L>
<L>Love of peace, and lonely musing,</L>
<L>In hollow murmurs died away.</L>
<L>But O, how alter'd was its sprightlier tone!</L>
<L>When Chearfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue,</L>
<L>Her bow across her shoulder flung,</L>

<L>He with viny crown advancing,</L>

<L>They would have thought, who heard the strain,</L>
<L>They saw in Tempe's vale her native maids,</L>
<L>Amidst the festal sounding shades,</L>
<L>To some unwearied minstrel dancing,</L>
<L>While, as his flying fingers kiss'd the strings,</L>
<L>Love fram'd with Mirth, a gay fantastic round,</L>
<L>Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound,</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="47"/>
And he, amidst his frolic play,</L>
<L>As if he would the charming air repay,</L>

<L>Friend of pleasure, wisdom's aid,</L>
<L>Why, Goddess, why to us denied?</L>
<L>Lay'st thou thy antient lyre aside?</L>

<L>Can well recall what then it heard.</L>
<L>Where is thy native simple heart,</L>
<L>Devote to virtue, fancy, art?</L>
<L>Arise, as in that elder time,</L>

<L>Thy wonders, in that god-like age,</L>
<L>Fill thy recording Sister's page—</L>
<L>'Tis said, and I believe the tale,</L>
<L>Thy humblest reed could more prevail,</L>
<L>Had more of strength, divinder rage,</L>

<L>O bid our vain endeavours cease,</L>

<L>WHEN approach'd by the fair dewy fingers of Spring,</L>
<L>Swelling buds open first, and look gay,</L>
<L>When the birds on the boughs by their mates sit and sing,</L>
<L>And are danc'd by the breeze on each spray:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When gently descending, the rain in soft showers,</L>
<L>With its moisture refreshes the ground,</L>
<L>And the drops, as they hang on the plants and the flowers,</L>
<L>Like rich gems beam a lustre around:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the wood-pigeons sit on the branches and cooe,</L>
<L>And the cuckow proclaims with his voice,</L>
<L>That Nature marks this for the season to wooe,</L>
<L>And for all that can love to rejoice:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In a cottage at night may I spend all my time,</L>
<L>In the fields and the meadows all day,</L>
<L>With a maiden whose charms are as yet in their prime,</L>
<L>Young as April, and blooming as May:</L>

<L>When the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn,</L>
<L>May my fairest and I sweetly wake,</L>

<L>When the sun shines so warm, that my charmer and I</L>

<L>Bubble out and transparently flow,</L>
<L>Creep gently along in meanders, and glide</L>
<L>Thro' the vale strow'd with daisies below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While the bee flies from blossom to blossom and sips,</L>
<L>And the violets their sweetness impart,</L>
<L>Let me hang on her neck, and so taste from her lips</L>
<L>The rich cordial that thrills to the heart.</L>
</LG>

<L>While the dove sits lamenting the loss of its mate,</L>
<L>Which the fowler has caught in his snares,</L>
<L>May we think ourselves blest that it is not our fate,</L>
<L>To endure such an absence as theirs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May I listen to all her soft, tender, sweet notes</L>
<L>When she sings, and no sounds interfere,</L>
<L>But the warbling of birds, which in stretching their throats</L>
<L>Are at strife to be louder than her.</L>

<L>When the daisies, and cowslips, and primroses blow,</L>

<L>When the lapwings just fledg'd o'er the turf take their run,</L>
<L>And the sirstlings are all at their play,</L>

<LG>
<L>The solemn grove, the venerable dome,</L>

<L>Ev'n chaste as they who Dian's mountain roam,</L>
<L>But not subjected to her gentle reign:</L>

<L>Far other Goddess did this train obey,</L>
<L>Far other temples, other altars rais'd,</L>
<L>Far other meaning breath'd their choral lay,</L>
<L>Far other incense on their altars blaz'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Veil'd Superstition wak'd her magic sound,</L>
<L>Bad Albion's sons sorsake the splendid court,</L>
<L>Forsake Amusement's variegated round,</L>

<HEAD>THE TRANSFORMATION OF LYCON AND EUPHORMIUS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM MELMOTH, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>DEEM not, ye plaintive crew, that suffer wrong,</L>
<L>Ne thou, O man! who deal'st the tort, misween</L>
<L>The equal gods, who heaven's sky-mansions throng,</L>
<L>(Though viewless to the eyne they distant sheen)</L>
<L>Spectators reckless of our actions been.</L>
<L>Turning the volumes of grave sages old,</L>
<L>Where auncient saws in fable may be seen,</L>
<L>This truth I fond in paynim tale enroll'd;</L>
<L>Which for ensample drad my muse shall here unfold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What time Arcadia's flowret vallies fam'd,</L>
<L>Pelasgus, first of monarchs old, obey'd,</L>
<L>There wonn'd a wight, and Lycon was he nam'd,</L>
<L>Unaw'd by conscience, of no gods afraid,</L>
<L>Ne justice rul'd his heart, ne mercy sway'd.</L>
<L>Some held him kin to that abhorred race,</L>
<L>Which heaven's high towers with mad emprize assay'd;</L>
<L>And some his cruel lynage did ytrace</L>
<L>From fell Erynnis join'd in Pluto's dire embrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
<L>But he, perdy, far other tale did feign,</L>
<L>And claim'd alliaunce with the Sisters nine;</L>
<L>And deem'd himself (what deems not pride so vain?)</L>
<L>The peerless paragon of wit divine.</L>
<L>Vaunting that every foe should rue its tine.</L>
<L>Right doughty wight! yet, sooth, withouten smart,</L>
<L>All powerless fell the losel's shafts malign:</L>
<L>'Tis Vertue's arm to wield Wit's heavenly dart,</L>
<L>Point its keen barb with force, and send it to the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One only impe he had, Pastora hight,</L>
<L>Whose sweet amenaunce pleas'd each shepherd's eye▪</L>
<L>Yet pleas'd she not base Lycon's evil spright,</L>
<L>Tho blame in her not Malice moten spy,</L>
<L>Clear, without spot, as summer's cloudless sky.</L>
<L>Hence poets feign'd, Lycean Pan array'd</L>
<L>In Lycon's form, enflam'd with passion high,</L>
<L>Deceiv'd her mother in the covert glade,</L>
<L>And from the stoln embrace ysprong the heavenly maid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus fabling they: mean while the damsel fair</L>
<L>A shepherd youth remark'd, as o'er the plain</L>
<L>She deffly pac'd elong so debonair:</L>
<L>Seem'd she as one of Dian's chosen train.</L>
<L>Full many a fond excuse he knew to feign,</L>
<L>In sweet converse to while with her the day,</L>
<L>'Till love unwares his heedless heart did gain.</L>
<L>Nor dempt he, simple wight, no mortal may</L>
<L>The blinded god once harbour'd, when he list, foresay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
<L>Now much he meditates if yet to speak,</L>
<L>And now resolves his passion to conceal:</L>
<L>But sure, quoth he, my seely heart will break,</L>
<L>If aye I smother what I aye must feel.</L>
<L>At length by hope embolden'd to reveal,</L>
<L>The labouring secret dropped from his tong.</L>
<L>Whiles frequent singults check'd his faltring tale,</L>
<L>In modest wise her head Pastora hong:</L>
<L>For never maid more chaste inspired shepherd's song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What needs me to recount in long detail</L>
<L>The tender parley which these lemans held:</L>
<L>How oft he vowed his love her ne'er should fail;</L>
<L>How oft the stream from forth her eyne outwell'd,</L>
<L>Doubting if constancy yet ever dwell'd</L>
<L>In heart of youthful wight: suffice to know,</L>
<L>Each rising doubt he in her bosome quell'd.</L>
<L>So parted they, more blithsome both, I trow:</L>
<L>For rankling love conceal'd, me seems, is deadly woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Eftsoons to Lycon swift the youth did fare,</L>
<L>(Lagg'd ever youth when Cupid urg'd his way?)</L>
<L>And straight his gentle purpose did declare,</L>
<L>And sooth the mount'naunce of his herds display.</L>
<L>Ne Lycon meant his suiten to foresay:</L>
<L>" Be thine, Pastora (quoth the masker sly)</L>
<L>" And twice two thousand sheep her dower shall pay."</L>
<L>Beat then the lover's heart with joyaunce high;</L>
<L>Ne dempt that aught his bliss could now betray,</L>
<L>Ne guess'd that foul deceit in Lycon's bosome lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
<L>So forth he yode to seek his reverend sire;</L>
<L>(The good Euphormius shepherds him did call)</L>
<L>How sweet Pastora did his bosome fire,</L>
<L>Her worth, her promis'd flocks, he tolden all.</L>
<L>Ah! nere, my son, let Lycon thee enthrall,</L>
<L>(Reply'd the sage, in wise experience old)</L>
<L>" Smooth is his tongue, but full of guile withal,</L>
<L>" In promise faithless, and in vaunting bold:</L>
<L>" Ne ever lamb of his will bleat within thy fold."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With words prophetick thus Euphormius spake:</L>
<L>And fact confirm'd what wisdom thus foretold:</L>
<L>Full many a mean devise did Lycon make,</L>
<L>The hoped day of spousal to with-hold,</L>
<L>Framing new trains when nought mote serve his old.</L>
<L>Nath'less he vow'd, Cyllene, cloud-topt hill,</L>
<L>Should sooner down the lowly delve be roll'd,</L>
<L>Than he his plighted promise nould fulfill:</L>
<L>But when, perdy, or where, the caitive sayen nill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whiles thus the tedious suns had journey'd round,</L>
<L>Ne ought mote now the lovers hearts divide,</L>
<L>Ne trust was there, ne truth in Lycon found;</L>
<L>The maid with matron Juno for her guide,</L>
<L>The youth by Concord led, in secret hy'd</L>
<L>To Hymen's sacred fane: the honest deed</L>
<L>Each god approv'd, and close the bands were ty'd.</L>
<L>Certes, till happier moments should succeed,</L>
<L>No prying eyne they ween'd their emprize mote areed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
<L>But prying eyne of Lycon 'twas in vain</L>
<L>(Right practick in disguise) to hope beware.</L>
<L>He trac'd their covert steps to Hymen's fane,</L>
<L>And joy'd to find them in his long-laid snare.</L>
<L>Algates, in semblaunt ire, he 'gan to swear,</L>
<L>And roaren loud as in displeasaunce high;</L>
<L>Then out he hurlen forth his daughter fair,</L>
<L>Forelore, the houseless child of Misery,</L>
<L>Expos'd to killing cold, and pinching penury.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! whither now shall sad Pastora wend,</L>
<L>To want abandon'd and by wrongs opprest?</L>
<L>Who shall the wretched out-cast's teen befriend?</L>
<L>Live's mercy then, if not in parent's breast?</L>
<L>At Jove's right hand, to Jove for ever dear,</L>
<L>Yes, MERCY lives, the gentle goddess blest,</L>
<L>Aye at his feet she pleads the cause distrest,</L>
<L>To Sorrow's plaints she turns his equal ear,</L>
<L>And wafts to heaven's star-throne fair Vertue's silent tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas SHE that bade Euphormius quell each thought</L>
<L>That well mote rise to check his generous aid.</L>
<L>Tho high the torts which Lycon him had wrought,</L>
<L>Tho few the flocks his humble pastures fed,</L>
<L>When as he learn'd Pastora's hapless sted,</L>
<L>His breast humane with wonted pity flows.</L>
<L>He op'd his gates, the naked exile led</L>
<L>Beneath his roof: a decent drapet throws</L>
<L>O'er her cold limbs, and sooths her undeserved woes.</L>

<L>To earth his flaming charret baden drive,</L>
<L>And down descends, enwrapt in peerless blaze,</L>
<L>To deal forth guerdon meet to good and evil ways.</L>

<LG>
<L>Where Eurymmanthus, crown'd with many a wood,</L>
<L>His silver stream through dasy'd vales does lead,</L>
<L>Stretch'd on the flowery marge, in reckless mood,</L>
<L>Proud Lycon sought by charm of jocund reed</L>
<L>To lull the dire remose of tortious deed.</L>
<L>Him Jove accosts, in reverend semblaunce dight</L>
<L>Of good Euphormius, and 'gan mild areed</L>

<L>LET others travel, with incessant pain,</L>
<L>The wealth of earth and ocean to secure;</L>
<L>Then with fond hopes caress the precious bane;</L>
<L>In grandeur abject, and in affluence poor.</L>

<LG>
<L>But soon, too soon, in Fancy's timid eyes,</L>
<L>Wild waves shall roll, and conflagrations spread;</L>
<L>While bright in arms, and of gigantic size,</L>

<L>Let me, in dreadless poverty retir'd,</L>
<L>The real joys of life, unenvied, share:</L>

<L>I'll yield to Wealth its jealousy and care.</L>

<L>On rising ground, the prospect to command,</L>
<L>Unting'd with smoke, where vernal breezes blow,</L>
<L>In rural neatness let my cottage stand;</L>
<L>Here wave a wood, and there a river flow.</L>
</LG>

<L>Oft from the neighbouring hills and pastures round,</L>
<L>Let sheep with tender bleat salute my ear;</L>
<L>Nor fox insidious haunt the guiltless ground,</L>
<L>Nor man pursue the trade of murder near:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far hence, kind heaven! expel the savage train,</L>
<L>Inur'd to blood, and eager to destroy;</L>
<L>Who pointed steel, with recent slaughter stain,</L>
<L>And place in groans and death their cruel joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Powers of social life and tender song!</L>
<L>To you devoted shall my fields remain;</L>
<L>Here undisturb'd the peaceful day prolong,</L>
<L>Nor own a smart but Love's delightful pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For you, my trees shall wave their leafy shade;</L>
<L>For you, my gardens tinge the lenient air;</L>

<L>But, O! if plaints which love and grief inspire,</L>
<L>In heavenly breasts could e'er compassion find,</L>
<L>Grant me, ah! grant my heart's supreme desire,</L>
<L>And teach my dear Urania to be kind.</L>

<L>Beneath her scorn each youthful ardor dies,</L>
<L>Its joys, its wishes, and its hopes, expire!</L>
<L>In vain the fields of Science tempt my eyes;</L>
<L>In vain for me the Muses string the lyre.</L>

<L>With her, the shades of night their horrors lose,</L>

<L>Its lambent radiance sparkles in her eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How sweet, with her, in Wisdom's calm recess,</L>
<L>To brighten soft desire with wit refin'd!</L>
<L>Kind Nature's laws with sacred Ashley trace,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or borne on Milton's flight, as heaven sublime,</L>
<L>View its full blaze in open prospect glow;</L>
<L>Bless the first pair in Eden's happy clime,</L>
<L>Or drop the human tear for endless woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when, in virtue, and in peace grown old,</L>
<L>No arts the languid lamp of life restore;</L>
<L>Her let me grasp with hands convuls'd and cold,</L>
<L>Till every nerve relax'd can hold no more.</L>

<HEAD>THE POOR MAN's PRAYER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN 1766. ADDRESSED TO THE EARL OF CHATHAM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AMIDST the more important toils of state,</L>
<L>The counsels labouring in thy patriot soul,</L>
<L>Tho' Europe from thy voice expect her fate,</L>
<L>And thy keen glance extend from pole to pole;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Chatham, nurs'd in ancient Virtue's lore,</L>
<L>To these sad strains incline a favouring ear;</L>
<L>Think on the God, whom thou, and I adore,</L>
<L>Nor turn unpitying from the poor man's prayer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah me! how blest was once a peasant's life!</L>
<L>No lawless passion swell'd my even breast;</L>
<L>Far from the stormy waves of civil strife,</L>
<L>Sound were my slumbers, and my heart at rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
<L>I ne'er for guilty, painful pleasures rov'd,</L>
<L>But taught by Nature, and by choice to wed,</L>
<L>From all the hamlet cull'd whom best I lov'd,</L>
<L>With her I staid my heart, with her my bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To gild her worth I ask'd no wealthy power,</L>
<L>My toil could feed her, and my arm defend;</L>
<L>In youth, or age, in pain, or pleasure's hour,</L>
<L>The same fond husband, father, brother, friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And she, the faithful partner of my care,</L>
<L>When ruddy evening streak'd the western sky,</L>
<L>Look'd towards the uplands, if her mate was there,</L>
<L>Or thro' the beech-wood cast an anxious eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, careful matron, heap'd the maple board</L>
<L>With savoury herbs, and pick'd the nicer part</L>
<L>From such plain food as Nature could afford,</L>
<L>Ere simple Nature was debauch'd by Art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While I, contented with my homely cheer,</L>
<L>Saw round my knees my prattling children play;</L>
<L>And oft with pleas'd attention sat to hear</L>
<L>The little history of their idle day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ah! how chang'd the scene! On the cold stones,</L>
<L>Where wont at night to blaze the chearful fire,</L>
<L>Pale Famine sits and counts her naked bones,</L>
<L>Still sighs for food, still pines with vain desire.</L>

<L>Dear tender pledges of my honest love,</L>

<L>With ripening corn, of all their charms despoil'd,</L>

<L>From the sun's heat, where all the passing hours</L>
<L>The good old man improv'd with converse high,</L>
<L>And in my breast enkindled Virtue's love;</L>
<L>Nor seldom would his hospitable hand</L>
<L>Afford a short repast of berries cool,</L>
<L>Which o'er the wilds (his scanty food) he pluck'd:</L>

<L>(The sacred object of his pious prayers)</L>
<L>Form'd of a tall fir's thunder-blasted trunk:</L>

Where all beneath th' expansive plains I saw</L>
<L>With white pavilions hid, in deep array.</L>
<L>There too my little fold, which late I left</L>

<L>With tearful eyes affrighted, I beheld.</L>
<L>Alas, how chang'd the scene! when there I pitch'd</L>

<HEAD>LAURA: OR, THE COMPLAINT. AN ELEGY.</HEAD>

<LG>
<L>YE groves, with venerable moss array'd,</L>
<L>That o'er yon caverns stretch your pendent shade,</L>
<L>Where sacred Silence lulls the rural vale,</L>
<L>And Love in whispers tells his tender tale,</L>
<L>Ye lonely rocks, ye streams that ever flow,</L>
<L>Still as my tears, and constant as my woe,</L>
<L>To you behold the wretched Laura flies,</L>
<L>And haunts those seats from whence her sorrows rise;</L>
<L>Where, lost to love, how often has she stray'd?</L>
<L>When the fond lover led his blushing maid,</L>
<L>When his soft lips, too eloquent his art,</L>
<L>Pour'd the warm wish, and breath'd out all his heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah once lov'd seats, your pleasing scenes are o'er,</L>
<L>Nor you can charm, since he can love no more;</L>
<L>Tho' smile your lawns with vernal glories crown'd,</L>
<L>In vain gay Nature paints th' enamel'd ground;</L>
<L><PB N="299" REF="301"/>
While through your solitary paths I rove,</L>
<L>A prey to grief, to sickness, and to love.</L>
<L>Tho' gentle Zephyrs fan the bending bowers,</L>
<L>Tho' breathes the incense of your opening flowers,</L>
<L>Nor opening flowers, nor gentle Zephyrs charm,</L>
<L>Nor beauteous scenes a grief like mine disarm;</L>
<L>Fade every flower, and languish every sense,</L>
<L>Ye have no sweets for fallen innocence.</L>
</LG>

<L>Torn by remorse, sad victim of Despair,</L>
<L>Where shall I turn? or where address my prayer?</L>
<L>Far as the morn its early beam displays,</L>
<L>Or where the star of evening darts its rays;</L>
<L>Far as wide earth is stretch'd, or oceans roll,</L>
<L>Where blow the winds, or heaven invests the pole,</L>
<L>In vain my fluttering soul would wing its way;</L>
<L>Stern Care pursues, where'er the wretched stray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sost God of Sleep, whose ever-peaceful reign</L>
<L>Lulls earth, and heaven, and all the extended main,</L>
<L>Powerful to give the labouring heart to rest,</L>
<L>To wipe the tear, and heal the wounded breast,</L>
<L>Say, by what crime offended, slies from me,</L>
<L>Invok'd, thy unpropitious Deity?</L>
<L>Or dooms, on racks of wildest Fancy torn,</L>
<L>In dreams my agonizing soul to mourn?</L>
<L>Why am I oft on angry billows tost,</L>
<L>Now in some wide and dreary desart lost?</L>
<L>Why yet in life infernal tortures feel,</L>
<L>Bound by fierce demons to some rapid wheel?</L>
<L><PB N="300" REF="302"/>
Now seem to climb, while hills on hills arife,</L>
<L>In vain: or fall in tempests from the skies,</L>
<L>Tread burning plains, or swim in seas of fire,</L>
<L>Just reach the shore, then see the shore retire?</L>
<L>As oft, dear youth! thy pleasing form appears;</L>
<L>I stretch my arms, and wake dissolv'd in tears;</L>
<L>Yet waking Fancy all that loss supplies,</L>
<L>And still I view thee with a lover's eyes;</L>
<L>Entranc'd, in thought, o'er all thy charms I gaze,</L>
<L>See thy bright eyes diffuse their softest rays,</L>
<L>Hang on thy hand, and on thy breast reclin'd,</L>
<L>Play with thy locks that waver with the wind,</L>
<L>Joy in thy joy, or in thy sorrows join,</L>
<L>And on thy lips my spirit mix with thine.</L>
<L>Now o'er dark wilds, or rugged rocks we stray,</L>
<L>Love lights the gloom, and smooths the dreary way;</L>
<L>Now on soft banks our weary limbs repose,</L>
<L>Where every flower of vernal beauty glows;</L>
<L>But light as air each pleasing vision flew,</L>
<L>Swift as the fun dispels the morning dew;</L>
<L>While with the day returns the sense of woe,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Imagination! mistress of the soul,</L>
<L>What powers unseen the active mind controul?</L>
<L>And fill the waking thought, or busy sleep?</L>

<L>O boast of Laura's long-forgotten praise!</L>
<L>Past are the triumphs of my happier days,</L>

<L>Where'er I turn'd, a thousand nymphs admir'd;</L>
<L>Whene'er I smil'd, a thousand swains expir'd:</L>
<L>I spoke, 'twas music dwelt upon my tongue;</L>
<L>I mov'd a goddess, and an angel sung.</L>
<L>My careless steps in joys were taught to rove;</L>
<L>Each voice was flattery, and each look was love;</L>

<L>Thus big with hope, from dark suspicion free,</L>
<L>I sail'd with transport on Life's summer sea;</L>
<L>The gay attendants of my happy state,</L>
<L>The Smiles, the Graces round were seen to wait,</L>

And all the moments, as they swiftly flew,</L>
<L>Shower'd down soft joys, and pleasures ever new.</L>
<L>How chang'd this fleeting image of a day?</L>
<L>How sets in awful gloom the evening ray?</L>

<L>Why earth's and ocean's mighty bounds explore</L>
<L>At once to win thee, and increase thy power?</L>
<L>Let sad example Reason's dictates aid;</L>
<L>Here see what ruin Grief and Love have made;</L>
<L>Even Love, who lives by Beauty's smiles carest,</L>
<L>Basks in her eyes, and wantons on her breast,</L>
<L>With cruel force the fatal shaft employs,</L>

<L>Thus did thy kiss dispel my empty fears,</L>
<L>Or winning voice delight my raptur'd ears;</L>
<L>Thus swore thy lips, by ocean, earth, and sky;</L>
<L>By hell's dread powers, and heaven's all-piercing eye?</L>

<L>To blast thy limbs, and rend thy perjur'd form?</L>

<L>Nurst in dark caverns on some mountain wild</L>

Curs'd be that fatal hour thy charms were seen,</L>

<L>Far flies thy lover: to some distant plain</L>

<L>Avenging heaven, that heard the vows he swore,</L>

'Till waves on waves in tumbling mountains roll,</L>

<L>Nature's Restorer, to preserve is thine;</L>
<L>Whose awful voice divine</L>
<L>Created all: when Discord heard, and ceas'd;</L>
<L>For it is thine to bind</L>
<L>The moral chain of Order's perfect law,</L>
<L>And to their course the swerving motions draw</L>
<L>Of changeful things, and erring human kind.</L>
<L>Death with insatiate jaw</L>
<L>Gnash'd oft his iron phang, and by his side</L>
<L>Stalking with ample stride</L>
<L>Vice rear'd his giant size</L>
<L>Up-towering to the skies.</L>
<L>The mourning earth was waste;</L>
<L>Confusion roll'd her tide;</L>
<L>When down the Virtues glide;</L>
<L>Soft Mercies urg'd their haste,</L>
<L>And o'er the bleeding world the sacred mantle cast.</L>

<L>Beyond created sense</L>
<L>Mysterious goodness, hid in deepest night!</L>
<L>In vain our feeble sight</L>
<L>Would pierce the gloom, O mighty Providence.</L>
<L>Where the deep mazes meet</L>
<L>Beneath thy awful throne no eye hath seen,</L>
<L>Where wrapt in darkness sits thy power serene,</L>
<L>And the loud thunders roll beneath thy feet.</L>
<L>O, when shall close the scene?</L>
<L>And Hope be lost in Truth's wide bursting ray?</L>
<L>O haste, auspicious day.</L>

<L>Sweet-smiling Peace and calm Content</L>
<L>Far from the busy crowd sequester'd dwell.</L>
<L>Mortal, approaching near,</L>
<L>The hallow'd seat revere,</L>

<HEAD>THE LOVER AND THE FRIEND.</HEAD>

<L>Like Noah's dove, my busy breast</L>

<L>Then, do I dream? or have I found</L>
<L>The fair and hospitable ground?</L>
<L>Ah! quit your sex's rules, and lend</L>
<L>A Lover's wishes to the Friend.</L>

<L>Absence I try'd,—but try'd in vain!</L>
<L>It heals not, but upbraids my pain;</L>

<HEAD>THE ENTHUSIAST: AN ODE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WM. WHITEHEAD, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>ONCE, I remember well the day,</L>
<L>'Twas ere the blooming sweets of May</L>
<L>Had lost their freshest hues,</L>
<L>When every flower on every hill,</L>
<L>In every vale, had drank its fill</L>
<L>Of sunshine, and of dews.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In short, 'twas that sweet season's prime</L>
<L>When Spring gives up the reins of Time</L>
<L>To Summer's glowing hand,</L>
<L>And doubting mortals hardly know,</L>
<L>By whose command the breezes blow</L>
<L>Which fan the smiling land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas then, beside a green-wood shade,</L>
<L>Which cloath'd a lawn's aspiring head</L>
<L>I urg'd my devious way,</L>
<L>With loitering steps regardless where,</L>
<L>So soft, so genial was the air,</L>
<L>So wonderous bright the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="317" REF="319"/>
<L>And now my eyes with transport rove</L>
<L>O'er all the blue expanse above,</L>
<L>Unbroken by a cloud!</L>
<L>And now beneath delighted pass,</L>
<L>Where winding thro' the deep-green grass</L>
<L>A full-brim'd river flow'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I stop, I gaze; in accents rude,</L>
<L>To thee, serenest Solitude,</L>
<L>Burst forth th' unbidden lay;</L>
<L>" Begone, vile world, the learn'd, the wise,</L>
<L>The great, the busy I despise,</L>
<L>And pity e'en the gay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These, these are joys alone, I cry;</L>
<L>'Tis here, divine Philosophy,</L>
<L>Thou deign'st to fix thy throne!</L>
<L>Here Contemplation points the road</L>
<L>Thro' Nature's charms to Nature's God!</L>
<L>These, these are joys alone!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Adieu, ye vain low-thoughted cares,</L>
<L>Ye human hopes, and human fears,</L>
<L>Ye pleasures and ye pains!"</L>
<L>While thus I spake, o'er all my soul</L>
<L>A philosophic calmness stole,</L>
<L>A stoic stillness reigns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="318" REF="320"/>
<L>The tyrant passions all subside,</L>
<L>Fear, anger, pity, shame and pride</L>
<L>No more my bosom move;</L>
<L>Yet still I felt, or seem'd to feel</L>
<L>A kind of visionary zeal</L>
<L>Of universal love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When lo! a voice, a voice I hear!</L>
<L>'Twas Reason whisper'd in my ear</L>
<L>These monitory strains:</L>
<L>What mean'st thou, man? would'st thou unbind</L>
<L>The ties which constitute thy kind,</L>
<L>The pleasures and the pains?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The same Almighty Power unseen,</L>
<L>Who spreads the gay or solemn scene</L>
<L>To Contemplation's eye,</L>
<L>Fix'd every movement of the soul,</L>
<L>Taught every wish its destin'd goal,</L>
<L>And quicken'd every joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He bids the tyrant passions rage,</L>
<L>He bids them war eternal wage,</L>
<L>And combat each his foe:</L>
<L>Till from dissensions concords rise;</L>
<L>And beauties from deformities,</L>
<L>And happiness from woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="319" REF="321"/>
<L>Art thou not man, and dar'st thou find</L>
<L>A bliss which leans not to mankind?</L>
<L>Presumptuous thought and vain!</L>
<L>Each bliss unshar'd is unenjoy'd,</L>
<L>Each power is weak unless employ'd</L>
<L>Some social good to gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall light and shade, and warmth and air,</L>
<L>With those exalted joys compare,</L>
<L>Which active Virtue feels!</L>
<L>When on she drags, as lawful prize,</L>
<L>Contempt, and Indolence, and Vice,</L>
<L>At her triumphant wheels.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As rest to labour still succeeds</L>
<L>To man, whilst Virtue's glorious deeds</L>
<L>Employ his toilsome day;</L>
<L>This fair variety of things,</L>
<L>Are merely Life's refreshing springs,</L>
<L>To sooth him on his way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enthusiast go, unstring thy lyre,</L>
<L>In vain thou sing'st, if none admire,</L>
<L>How sweet soe'er the strain.</L>
<L>And is not thy o'erflowing mind,</L>
<L>Unless thou mixest with thy kind,</L>
<L>Benevolent in vain?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="320" REF="322"/>
<L>Enthusiast go, try every sense,</L>
<L>If not thy bliss, thy excellence,</L>

<L>And see them all uniting show,</L>
