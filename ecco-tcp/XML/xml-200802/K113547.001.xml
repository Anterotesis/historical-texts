<P>THE BEAUTIES OF ENGLISH POESY. SELECTED BY OLIVER GOLDSMITH. IN TWO VOLUMES.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MY Bookseller having informed me that there was no collection of English Poetry among us, of any estima∣tion, I thought a few Hours spent in making a proper selection would not be ill bestowed. Compilations of this kind are chiefly designed for such as either want leisure, skill, or fortune, to choose for themselves; for persons whose professions turn them to different pursuits, or who, not yet arrived at sufficient maturity, re∣quire a guide to direct their application. To our youth, particularly, a publication
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
of this sort may be useful; since, if com∣piled with any share of judgement, it may at once unite precept and example, shew them what is beautiful, and inform them why it is so: I therefore offer this, to the best of my judgement, as the best collec∣tion that has yet appeared: though, as tastes are various, numbers will be of a very different opinion. Many perhaps may wish to see in it the poems of their favourite Authors, others may wish that I had selected from works less generally read, and others still may wish, that I had se∣lected from their own. But my design was to give a useful, unaffected compila∣tion; one that might tend to advance the reader's taste, and not impress him with exalted ideas of mine. Nothing so com∣mon, and yet so absurd, as affectation in criticism. The desire of being thought to
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
have a more discerning taste than others, has often led writers to labour after error, and to be foremost in promoting deformity. In this compilation I run but few risques of that kind; every poem here is well known, and possessed, or the public has been long mistaken, of peculiar merit: every poem has, as Aristotle expresses it, a beginning, a middle, and an end, in which, however trifling the rule may seem, most of the poetry in our language is deficient: I claim no merit in the choice, as it was obvious, for in all languages the best productions are most easily found. As to the short introductory criticisms to each poem, they are rather designed for boys than men; for it will be seen that I declined all refinement, satisfied with being obvious and sincere. In short, if this work be useful in schools, or amusing in
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
the closet, the merit all belongs to others; I have nothing to boast, and, at best, can expect, not applause, but pardon.</P>

<HEAD>The Rape of the Lock.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>This seems to be Mr. Pope's most finished produc∣tion, and is, perhaps, the most perfect in our language. It exhibits stronger powers of imagina∣tion, more harmony of numbers, and a greater knowledge of the world, than any other of this poet's works: and it is probable, if our country were called upon to shew a specimen of their ge∣nius to foreigners, this would be the work here fixed upon.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>WHAT dire offence from am'rous causes springs,</L>
<L>What mighty contests rise from trivial things,</L>
<L>I sing—This verse to CARYL, Muse! is due:</L>
<L>This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view:</L>
<L>Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,</L>
<L>If She inspire, and He approve my lays.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="9"/>Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel</L>
<L>A well-bred Lord t'assault a gentle Belle?</L>
<L>O say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd,</L>
<L>Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?</L>
<L>In tasks so bold, can little men engage,</L>
<L>And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage?</L>
<L>Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray,</L>
<L>And ope'd those eyes that must eclipse the day:</L>
<L>Now lap-dogs gave themselves the rouzing shake,</L>
<L>And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:</L>
<L>Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,</L>
<L>And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.</L>
<L>Belinda still her downy pillow prest;</L>
<L>Her guardian SYLPH prolong'd the balmy rest:</L>
<L>'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed</L>
<L>The morning dream that hover'd o'er her head.</L>
<L>A youth more glitt'ring than a birth-night beau,</L>
<L>(That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow)</L>
<L>Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay,</L>
<L>And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say.</L>
<L>Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care</L>
<L>Of thousand bright inhabitants of air!</L>
<L>If e'er one Vision touch thy infant thought,</L>
<L>Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught;</L>
<L>Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen,</L>
<L>The silver token, and the circled green,</L>
<L>Or virgins visited by Angel-pow'rs,</L>
<L>With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs;</L>
<L>Hear and believe! thy own importance know,</L>
<L>Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="10"/>Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,</L>
<L>To Maids alone and children are reveal'd:</L>
<L>What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give,</L>
<L>The Fair and Innocent shall still believe.</L>
<L>Know, then, unnumbered Spirits round thee fly,</L>
<L>The light Militia of the lower sky:</L>
<L>These, tho' unseen, are ever on the wing,</L>
<L>Hang o'er the Box, and hover round the Ring.</L>
<L>Think what an equipage thou hast in air,</L>
<L>And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair.</L>
<L>As now your own, our beings were of old,</L>
<L>And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mould;</L>
<L>Thence, by a soft transition, we repair</L>
<L>From earthly vehicles to these of air.</L>
<L>Think not, when Woman's transient breath is fled,</L>
<L>That all her vanities at once are dead;</L>
<L>Succeeding vanities she still regards,</L>
<L>And, tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.</L>
<L>Her joy in gilded Chariots, when alive,</L>
<L>And love of Ombre, after death survive.</L>
<L>For when the Fair in all their pride expire,</L>
<L>To their first Elements their Souls retire:</L>
<L>The sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame</L>
<L>Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.</L>
<L>Soft yielding minds to Water glide away,</L>
<L>And sip, with nymphs, their elemental tea.</L>
<L>The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome,</L>
<L>In search of mischief still on Earth to roam.</L>
<L>The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,</L>
<L>And sport and flutter in the fields of air.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11"/>Know farther yet; whoever, fair and chaste,</L>
<L>Rejects mankind, is by some Sylph embrac'd:</L>
<L>For Spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease</L>
<L>Assume what sexes and what shapes they please.</L>
<L>What guards the purity of melting maids,</L>
<L>In courtly balls, and midnight masquerades,</L>
<L>Safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark,</L>
<L>The glance by day, the whisper in the dark,</L>
<L>When kind occasion prompts their warm desires,</L>
<L>Whe music softens, and when dancing fires?</L>
<L>'Tis but their Sylph, the wise Celestials know,</L>
<L>Tho' Honour is the word with Men below.</L>
<L>Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face,</L>
<L>For life predestin'd to the Gnomes embrace.</L>
<L>These swell their prospects and exalt their pride,</L>
<L>When offers are disdain'd, and love deny'd:</L>
<L>Then gay ideas croud the vacant brain,</L>
<L>While Peers, and Dukes, and all their sweeping train,</L>
<L>And Garters, Stars, and Coronets appear,</L>
<L>And, in soft sounds, Your Grace salutes their ear.</L>
<L>'Tis these that early taint the female soul,</L>
<L>Instruct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll,</L>
<L>Teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know,</L>
<L>And little hearts to flutter at a Beau.</L>
<L>Oft, when the world imagine women stray,</L>
<L>The Sylphs thro' mystic mazes guide their way,</L>
<L>Thro' all the giddy circle they pursue,</L>
<L>And old impertinence expel by new.</L>
<L>What tender maid but must a victim fall</L>
<L>To one man's treat, but for another's ball?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="12"/>When Florio speaks, what virgin could withstand,</L>
<L>If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand;</L>
<L>With varying vanities, from ev'ry part</L>
<L>They shift the moving Toy-shop of their heart;</L>
<L>Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,</L>
<L>Beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive.</L>
<L>This erring mortals Levity may call,</L>
<L>Oh blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.</L>
<L>Of these am I, who thy protection claim;</L>
<L>A watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name.</L>
<L>Late, as I rang'd the crystal wilds of air,</L>
<L>In the clear Mirror of thy ruling star</L>
<L>I saw, alas, some dread event impend,</L>
<L>Ere to the main this morning sun descend;</L>
<L>But heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where:</L>
<L>Warn'd by the Sylph, oh pious maid, beware!</L>
<L>This to disclose is all thy guardian can:</L>
<L>Beware of all; but, most, beware of Man!</L>
<L>He said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long,</L>
<L>Leap'd up, and wak'd his mistress with his tongue.</L>
<L>'Twas then, Belinda, if report say true,</L>
<L>Thy eyes first open'd on a Billet-doux;</L>
<L>Wounds, Charms, and Ardors, were no sooner read,</L>
<L>But all the Vision vanish'd from thy head.</L>
<L>And now, unveil'd, the Toilet stands display'd,</L>
<L>Each silver vase in mystic order laid.</L>
<L>First, rob'd in white, the Nymph intent adores,</L>
<L>With head uncover'd, the Cosmetic pow'rs.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="13"/>A heav'nly image in the glass appears,</L>
<L>To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;</L>
<L>Th' inferior Priestess, at her altar's side,</L>
<L>Trembling, begins the sacred rites of Pride.</L>
<L>Unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here</L>
<L>The various off'rings of the world appear;</L>
<L>From each she nicely culls, with curious toil,</L>
<L>And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring spoil.</L>
<L>This casket, India's glowing gems unlocks,</L>
<L>And all Arabia breathes from yonder box.</L>
<L>The Tortoise here and Elephant unite,</L>
<L>Transform'd to combs, the speckled and the white.</L>
<L>Here files of pins extend their shining rows,</L>
<L>Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux.</L>
<L>Now awful beauty puts on all its arms;</L>
<L>The fair each moment rises in her charms,</L>
<L>Repairs her smiles, awakens every grace,</L>
<L>And calls forth all the wonders of her face:</L>
<L>Sees by degrees a purer blush arise,</L>
<L>And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.</L>
<L>The busy Sylphs surround their darling care,</L>
<L>These set the head, and those divide the hair;</L>
<L>Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown;</L>
<L>And Betty's prais'd for labours not her own.</L>
<L>Not with more glories, in th' etherial plain,</L>
<L>The sun first rises o'er the purpled main,</L>
<L>Than, issuing forth, the rival of his beams</L>
<L>Launch'd on the bosom of the silver'd Thames.</L>
<L>Fair Nymphs, and well-dress'd Youths, around her shone,</L>
<L>But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="14"/>On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore,</L>
<L>Which Jews might kiss, and Infidels adore.</L>
<L>Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,</L>
<L>Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those;</L>
<L>Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;</L>
<L>Oft she rejects, but never once offends.</L>
<L>Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,</L>
<L>And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.</L>
<L>Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,</L>
<L>Might hide her faults, if Belles had faults to hide:</L>
<L>If to her share some female errors fall,</L>
<L>Look on her face and you'll forget 'em all.</L>
<L>This nymph, to the destruction of mankind,</L>
<L>Nourish'd two Locks which graceful hung behind</L>
<L>In equal curls, and well conspir'd to deck,</L>
<L>With shining ringlets, the smooth iv'ry neck.</L>
<L>Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,</L>
<L>And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.</L>
<L>With hairy springes we the birds betray,</L>
<L>Slight lines of hair surprize the finny prey,</L>
<L>Fair tresses men's imperial race insnare,</L>
<L>And beauty draws us with a single hair.</L>
<L>Th' advent'rous Baron the bright locks admir'd;</L>
<L>He saw, he wish'd, and to the prize aspir'd.</L>
<L>Resolv'd to win, he meditates the way,</L>
<L>By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;</L>
<L>For when success a lover's toil attends,</L>
<L>Few ask, if fraud or force attain'd his ends.</L>
<L>For this, 'ere Phoebus rose, he had implor'd</L>
<L>Propitious heav'n, and ev'ry pow'r ador'd;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="15"/>But chiefly Love—to Love an Altar built,</L>
<L>Of twelve vast French Romances, neatly gilt.</L>
<L>There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves,</L>
<L>And all the trophies of his former loves.</L>
<L>With tender billet-doux he lights the pyre,</L>
<L>And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire.</L>
<L>Then prostrate falls, and begs, with ardent eyes,</L>
<L>Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:</L>
<L>The pow'rs gave ear, and granted half his pray'r,</L>
<L>The rest, the winds dispers'd in empty air.</L>
<L>But now secure the painted vessel glides,</L>
<L>The sun-beams trembling on the floating tides:</L>
<L>While melting music steals upon the sky,</L>
<L>And soften'd sounds along the waters die;</L>
<L>Smooth flow the waves, the Zephyrs gently play,</L>
<L>Belinda smil'd, and all the world was gay.</L>
<L>All but the Sylph—with careful thoughts opprest,</L>
<L>Th' impending woe sat heavy on his breast.</L>
<L>He summons strait his Denizens of air;</L>
<L>The lucid squadrons round the sails repair:</L>
<L>Soft o'er the shrouds aërial whispers breathe,</L>
<L>That seem'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath.</L>
<L>Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold,</L>
<L>Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;</L>
<L>Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,</L>
<L>Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light.</L>
<L>Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,</L>
<L>Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew,</L>
<L>Dip'd in the richest tincture of the skies,</L>
<L>Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="16"/>While ev'ry beam new transient colours slings,</L>
<L>Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings,</L>
<L>Amid the circle on the gilded mast,</L>
<L>Superior by the head, was Ariel plac'd;</L>
<L>His purple pinions op'ning to the sun,</L>
<L>He rais'd his azure wand, and thus begun.</L>
<L>Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear,</L>
<L>Fay, Fairies, Genii, Elves, and Daemons hear!</L>
<L>Ye know the spheres, and various tasks assign'd</L>
<L>By laws eternal to the aërial kind.</L>
<L>Some in the fields of purest aether play,</L>
<L>And bask and whiten in the blaze of day;</L>
<L>Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high,</L>
<L>Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky.</L>
<L>Some, less refin'd, beneath the moon's pale light</L>
<L>Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,</L>
<L>Or suck the mists in grosser air below,</L>
<L>Or dip their pinions in the painted bow,</L>
<L>Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,</L>
<L>Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain.</L>
<L>Others on earth o'er human race preside,</L>
<L>Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:</L>
<L>Of these the chief the care of Nations own,</L>
<L>And guard with arms divine the British throne.</L>
<L>Our humbler province is to tend the Fair,</L>
<L>Not a less pleasing, tho' less glorious care;</L>
<L>To save the powder from too rude a gale,</L>
<L>Nor let th' imprison'd essences exhale;</L>
<L>To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs;</L>
<L>To steal from rainbows ere they drop in show'rs,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="17"/>A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,</L>
<L>Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;</L>
<L>Nay oft, in dreams, invention we bestow,</L>
<L>To change a Flounce, or add a Furbelow.</L>
<L>This day, black Omens threat the brightest Fair</L>
<L>That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit's care;</L>
<L>Some dire disaster, or by force, or slight;</L>
<L>But what, or where, the fates have wrap'd in night.</L>
<L>Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law,</L>
<L>Or some frail China-jar receive a flaw;</L>
<L>Or stain her honour, or her new brocade;</L>
<L>Forget her pray'rs, or miss a masquerade;</L>
<L>Or lose her heart or necklace at a ball;</L>
<L>Or whether heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall.</L>
<L>Haste then, ye spirits! to your charge repair:</L>
<L>The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta's care;</L>
<L>The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;</L>
<L>And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;</L>
<L>Do thou, Crispissa, tend her fav'rite Lock;</L>
<L>Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.</L>
<L>To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note,</L>
<L>We trust th' important charge, the Petticoat:</L>
<L>Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail,</L>
<L>Tho' stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale;</L>
<L>Form a strong line about the silver bound,</L>
<L>And guard the wide circumference around.</L>
<L>Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,</L>
<L>His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,</L>
<L>Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,</L>
<L>Be stop'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="18"/>Or plang'd in lakes of bitter washes lie,</L>
<L>Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye:</L>
<L>Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain,</L>
<L>While, clog'd, he beats his silken wings in vain;</L>
<L>Or Alum styptics, with contracting pow'r,</L>
<L>Shrink his thin essence like a shrivel'd flow'r:</L>
<L>Or, as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel</L>
<L>The giddy motion of the whirling mill,</L>
<L>In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow,</L>
<L>And tremble at the sea that froths below!</L>
<L>He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;</L>
<L>Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;</L>
<L>Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair;</L>
<L>Some hang upon the pendants of her ear;</L>
<L>With beating hearts the dire event they wait,</L>
<L>Anxious, and trembling for the birth of Fate.</L>
<L>Close by those meads, forever crown'd with flow'rs,</L>
<L>Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs,</L>
<L>There stands a structure of majestic frame,</L>
<L>Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.</L>
<L>Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom</L>
<L>Of foreign Tyrants, and of Nymphs at home;</L>
<L>Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,</L>
<L>Dost sometimes counsel take—and sometimes tea.</L>
<L>Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,</L>
<L>To taste awhile the pleasures of a Court;</L>
<L>In various talk th' instructive hours they past,</L>
<L>Who gave the ball or paid the visit last:</L>
<L>One speaks the glory of the British Queen,</L>
<L>And one describes a charming Indian screen;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="19"/>A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;</L>
<L>At ev'ry word a reputation dies.</L>
<L>Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,</L>
<L>With singing, laughing, ogling, <HI>and all that.</HI></L>
<L>Meanwhile, declining from the noon of day,</L>
<L>The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;</L>
<L>The hungry judges soon the sentence sign,</L>
<L>And wretches hang that Jurymen may dine;</L>
<L>The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace,</L>
<L>And the long labours of the toilet cease.</L>
<L>Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,</L>
<L>Burns to encounter two advent'rous Knights,</L>
<L>At Ombre singly to decide their doom,</L>
<L>And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.</L>
<L>Strait the three bands prepare in arms to join,</L>
<L>Each band the number of the sacred nine.</L>
<L>Soon as she spreads her hand, th' aërial guard</L>
<L>Descend, and sit on each important card:</L>
<L>First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore,</L>
<L>Then each according to the rank he bore;</L>
<L>For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,</L>
<L>Are, as when women, wond'rous fond of place.</L>
<L>Behold, four Kings in majesty rever'd,</L>
<L>With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;</L>
<L>And four fair Queens, whose hands sustain a flow'r,</L>
<L>Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r;</L>
<L>Four knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band;</L>
<L>Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;</L>
<L>And party-colour'd troops, a shining train,</L>
<L>Drawn forth to combat on the velvet plain.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="20"/>The skilful nymph reviews her force with care:</L>
<L>Let Spades be trumps! she said, and trumps they were.</L>
<L>Now move to war her sable Matadores,</L>
<L>In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.</L>
<L>Spadillio first, unconquerable Lord!</L>
<L>Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board.</L>
<L>As many more Manillio forc'd to yield,</L>
<L>And march'd a victor from the verdant field.</L>
<L>Him Basto follow'd; but his fate, more hard,</L>
<L>Gain'd but one trump, and one Plebeian card.</L>

<L>Why round our coaches crowd the white-glov'd Beaux,</L>

<HEAD>THE HERMIT.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>This poem is held in just esteem, the versification being chaste, and tolerably harmonious, and the story told with perspicuity and conciseness. It seems to have cost great labour, both to Mr. Pope, and Parnell himself, to bring it to this perfection. It may not be amiss to observe, that the fable is taken from one of Dr. Henry Moore's Dialogues.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>FAR in a wild, unknown to public view,</L>
<L>From youth to age a rev'rend Hermit grew;</L>
<L>The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,</L>
<L>His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well:</L>
<L>Remote from man, with God he pass'd the days,</L>
<L>Pray'r all his bus'ness, all his pleasure, praise.</L>
<L>A life so sacred, such serene repose,</L>
<L>Seem'd heav'n itself, till one suggestion rose;</L>
<L>That vice should triumph, virtue vice obey;</L>
<L>This sprung some doubt of providence's sway:</L>
<L>His hopes no more a certain prospect boast,</L>
<L>And all the tenour of his soul is lost:</L>
<L>So when a smooth expanse receives, imprest,</L>
<L>Calm nature's image on its watry breast,</L>
<L>Down bend the banks, the trees depending grow,</L>
<L>And skies beneath with answ'ring colours glow:</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="37"/>But if a stone the gentle sea divide,</L>
<L>Swift ruffling circles curl on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>And glimmering fragments of a broken sun,</L>
<L>Banks, seas, and skies, in thick disorder run.</L>
<L>To clear this doubt, to know the world by sight,</L>
<L>To find if books, or swains, report it right;</L>
<L>(For yet by swains alone the world he knew,</L>
<L>Whose feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly dew)</L>
<L>He quits his cell; the Pilgrim-staff he bore,</L>
<L>And fix'd the Scallop in his hat before;</L>
<L>Then with the sun a rising journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each event.</L>
<L>The morn was wasted in the pathless grass,</L>
<L>And long and lonesome was the wild to pass;</L>
<L>But when the southern sun had warm'd the day,</L>
<L>A youth came posting o'er a crossing way;</L>
<L>His rayment decent, his complexion fair,</L>
<L>And soft in graceful ringlets wav'd his hair.</L>
<L>Then, near approaching, Father, hail! he cry'd,</L>
<L>And hail, my Son, the rev'rend fire reply'd;</L>
<L>Words follow'd words, from question answer flow'd,</L>
<L>And talk of various kind deceiv'd the road;</L>
<L>'Till each with other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their rage they differ, join in heart:</L>
<L>Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound;</L>
<L>Thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around.</L>
<L>Now sunk the sun; the closing hour of day</L>
<L>Came onward, mantled o'er with sober grey;</L>
<L>Nature in silence bid the world repose;</L>
<L>When, near the road, a stately palace rose:</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="38"/>There, by the moon, thro' ranks of trees they pass,</L>
<L>Whose verdure crown'd their sloping sides of grass.</L>
<L>It chanc'd the noble master of the dome,</L>
<L>Still made his house the wand'ring stranger's home:</L>
<L>Yet still the kindness, from a thirst of praise,</L>
<L>Prov'd the vain flourish of expensive ease.</L>
<L>The pair arrive: the livery'd servants wait;</L>
<L>Their lord receives them at the pompous gate,</L>
<L>The table groans with costly piles of food,</L>
<L>And all is more than hospitably good.</L>
<L>Then led to rest, the day's long toil they drown,</L>
<L>Deep sunk in sleep, and silk, and heaps of down.</L>
<L>At length 'tis morn, and, at the dawn of day,</L>
<L>Along the wide canals the Zephyrs play;</L>
<L>Fresh o'er the gay parterre the breezes creep,</L>
<L>And shake the neighb'ring wood to banish sleep.</L>
<L>Up rise the guests, obedient to the call:</L>
<L>An early banquet deck'd the splendid hall;</L>
<L>Rich, luscious wine a golden goblet grac'd,</L>
<L>Which the kind master forc'd the guests to taste.</L>
<L>Then, pleas'd and thankful, from the porch they go;</L>
<L>And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe;</L>
<L>His cup was vanish'd; for, in secret guise,</L>
<L>The younger guest purloin'd the glitt'ring prize.</L>
<L>As one who spies a serpent in his way,</L>
<L>Glist'ning and basking in the summer ray,</L>
<L>Disorder'd stops to shun the danger near,</L>
<L>Then walks with faintness on, and looks with fear:</L>
<L>So seem'd the sire, when, far upon the road,</L>
<L>The shining spoil his wily partner show'd.</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="39"/>He stopp'd with silence; walk'd with trembling heart,</L>
<L>And much he wish'd, but durst not ask to part:</L>
<L>Murm'ring he lifts his eyes, and thinks it hard,</L>
<L>That gen'rous actions meet a base reward.</L>
<L>While thus they pass, the sun his glory shrouds,</L>
<L>The changing skies hang out their sable clouds;</L>
<L>A sound in air presag'd approaching rain,</L>
<L>And beasts to covert scud across the plain.</L>
<L>Warn'd by the signs the wand'ring pair retreat,</L>
<L>To seek for shelter at a neighb'ring seat.</L>
<L>'Twas built with turrets, on a rising ground,</L>
<L>And strong, and large, and unimprov'd around;</L>
<L>Its owner's temper tim'rous and severe,</L>
<L>Unkind and griping, caus'd a desart there.</L>
<L>As near the miser's heavy doors they drew,</L>
<L>Fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew;</L>
<L>The nimble lightning, mix'd with show'rs, began,</L>
<L>And o'er their heads loud rolling thunder ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the wind, and batter'd by the rain.</L>
<L>At length some pity warm'd the master's breast,</L>
<L>('Twas then his threshold first receiv'd a guest)</L>
<L>Slow, creaking, turns the door, with jealous care,</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the shiv'ring pair;</L>
<L>One frugal faggot lights the naked walls,</L>
<L>And nature's fervour thro' their limbs recalls:</L>
<L>Bread of the coarsest sort, with eager wine,</L>
<L>(Each hardly granted) serv'd them both to dine;</L>
<L>And, when the tempest first appear'd to cease,</L>
<L>A ready warning bid them part in peace.</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="40"/>With still remark the pond'ring Hermit view'd,</L>
<L>In one so rich, a life so poor and rude;</L>
<L>And why should such, within himself he cry'd,</L>
<L>Lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside?</L>
<L>But what new marks of wonder soon took place</L>
<L>In ev'ry settling feature of his face;</L>
<L>When from his vest the young companion bore</L>
<L>That cup, the gen'rous landlord own'd before,</L>
<L>And paid, profusely, with the precious bowl,</L>
<L>The stinted kindness of his churlish soul.</L>
<L>But now the clouds in airy tumult fly,</L>
<L>The sun emerging opes an azure sky;</L>
<L>A fresher green the smelling leaves display,</L>
<L>And, glitt'ring as they tremble, chear the day:</L>
<L>The weather courts them from the poor retreat,</L>
<L>And the glad master bolts the wary gate.</L>
<L>While hence they walk, the pilgrim's bosom wrought</L>
<L>With all the travail of uncertain thought;</L>
<L>His partner's acts without their cause appear;</L>
<L>'Twas there a vice, and seem'd a madness here:</L>
<L>Detesting that, and pitying this, he goes,</L>
<L>Lost and confounded with the various shows.</L>
<L>Now night's dim shades again involve the sky,</L>
<L>Again the wand'rers want a place to lie,</L>
<L>Again they search, and find a lodging nigh.</L>
<L>The soil improv'd around, the mansion neat,</L>
<L>And neither poorly low, nor idly great:</L>
<L>It seem'd to speak its master's turn of mind,</L>
<L>Content, and, not for praise, but virtue, kind.</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="41"/>Hither the walkers turn, with weary feet,</L>
<L>Then bless the mansion, and the master greet:</L>
<L>Their greeting fair, bestow'd with modest guise,</L>
<L>The courteous master hears, and thus replies:</L>
<L>Without a vain, without a grudging heart,</L>
<L>To him who gives us all, I yield a part;</L>
<L>From him you come, for him accept it here,</L>
<L>A frank and sober, more than costly cheer.</L>
<L>He spoke, and bid the welcome table spread,</L>
<L>Then talk'd of virtue till the time of bed,</L>
<L>When the grave houshold round his hall repair,</L>
<L>Warn'd by a bell, and close the hours with pray'r.</L>
<L>At length the world, renew'd by calm repose,</L>
<L>Was strong for toil, the dappled morn arose;</L>
<L>Before the pilgrims part, the younger crept</L>
<L>Near the clos'd cradle, where an infant slept,</L>
<L>And writh'd his neck; the landlord's little pride,</L>
<L>O strange return! grew black, and gasp'd, and dy'd.</L>
<L>Horror of horrors! what! his only son!</L>
<L>How look'd our hermit when the fact was done;</L>
<L>Not hell, tho' hell's black jaws in sunder part,</L>
<L>And breathe blue fire, could more assault his heart.</L>
<L>Confus'd, and struck with silence at the deed,</L>
<L>He flies, but, trembling, fails to fly with speed.</L>
<L>His steps the youth pursues: the country lay</L>
<L>Perplex'd with roads, a servant show'd the way;</L>
<L>A river cross'd the path; the passage o'er</L>
<L>Was nice to find; the servant rode before;</L>
<L>Long arms of oaks an open bridge supply'd,</L>
<L>And deep the waves beneath the bending glide.</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="42"/>The youth, who seem'd to watch a time to sin,</L>
<L>Approach'd the careless guide, and thrust him in;</L>
<L>Plunging, he falls, and, rising, lifts his head,</L>
<L>Then, flashing, turns, and sinks among the dead.</L>
<L>Wild, sparkling rage, inflames the father's eyes,</L>
<L>He bursts the bands of fear, and madly cries,</L>
<L>Detested wretch—But scarce his speech began,</L>
<L>When the strange partner seem'd no longer man:</L>
<L>His youthful face grew more serenely sweet;</L>
<L>His robe turn'd white, and flow'd upon his feet;</L>
<L>Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair;</L>
<L>Celestial odours breathe thro' purpled air;</L>
<L>And wings, whose colours glitter'd on the day,</L>
<L>Wide at his back the gradual plumes display.</L>
<L>The form etherial bursts upon his sight,</L>
<L>And moves in all the majesty of light.</L>
<L>Tho' loud, at first, the pilgrim's passion grew,</L>
<L>Sudden he gaz'd, and wist not what to do;</L>
<L>Surprize in secret chains his words suspends,</L>
<L>And in a calm his settling temper ends.</L>
<L>But silence here the beauteous angel broke,</L>
<L>(The voice of music ravish'd as he spoke.)</L>
<L>Thy pray'r, thy praise, thy life, to vice unknown,</L>
<L>In sweet memorial rise before the throne:</L>
<L>These charms success in our bright region find,</L>
<L>And force an Angel down, to calm thy mind!</L>
<L>For this commission'd, I forsook the sky;</L>
<L>Nay, cease to kneel—thy fellow-servant I.</L>
<L>Then know the truth of government divine,</L>
<L>And let these scruples be no longer thine.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="43"/>The maker justly claims that world he made;</L>
<L>In this the right of providence is laid;</L>
<L>Its sacred majesty thro' all depends</L>
<L>On using second means to work his ends:</L>
<L>'Tis thus, withdrawn in state from human eye,</L>
<L>The Pow'r exerts his Attributes on high,</L>
<L>Your actions uses, nor controuls your will,</L>
<L>And bids the doubting sons of men be still.</L>
<L>What strange events can strike with more surprize,</L>
<L>Than those which lately struck thy wond'ring eyes?</L>
<L>Yet, taught by these, confess th' Almighty just,</L>
<L>And, where you can't unriddle, learn to trust!</L>
<L>The great, vain man, who far'd on costly food,</L>
<L>Whose life was too luxurious to be good;</L>
<L>Who made his ivory stands with goblets shine,</L>
<L>And forc'd his guests to morning draughts of wine,</L>
<L>Has, with the cup, the graceless custom lost;</L>
<L>And still he welcomes, but with less of cost.</L>
<L>The mean, suspicious wretch, whose bolted door</L>
<L>Ne'er mov'd in duty to the wand'ring poor;</L>
<L>With him I left the cup, to teach his mind,</L>
<L>That heav'n can bless, if mortals will be kind.</L>
<L>Conscious of wanting worth, he views the bowl,</L>
<L>And feels compassion touch his grateful soul.</L>
<L>Thus artists melt the sullen oar of lead,</L>
<L>With heaping coals of fire upon its head;</L>
<L>In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow,</L>
<L>And, loose from dross, the silver runs below.</L>
<L>Long had our pious friend in virtue trod,</L>
<L>But now the child half-wean'd his heart from God;</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="44"/>(Child of his age) for him he liv'd in pain,</L>
<L>And measur'd back his steps to earth again.</L>
<L>To what excesses had his dotage run?</L>
<L>But God, to save the father, took the son.</L>
<L>To all but thee, in fits he seem'd to go,</L>
<L>(And 'twas my ministry to deal the blow)</L>
<L>The poor fond parent, humbled in the dust,</L>
<L>Now owns, in tears, the punishment was just.</L>
<L>But now had all his fortune felt a wreck,</L>
<L>Had that false servant sped in safety back?</L>
<L>This night his treasur'd heaps he meant to steal;</L>
<L>And what a fund of charity would fail!</L>
<L>Thus heav'n instructs thy mind: this trial o'er,</L>
<L>Depart in peace, resign, and sin no more.</L>
<L>On sounding pinions here the youth withdrew,</L>
<L>The sage stood wond'ring as the seraph flew.</L>
<L>Thus look'd Elisha, when, to mount on high,</L>
<L>His master took the chariot of the sky;</L>
<L>The fiery pomp ascending, left the view;</L>
<L>The prophet gaz'd, and wish'd to follow too.</L>
<L>The bending hermit here a pray'r begun,</L>

<HEAD>LONDON. In Imitation of the Third Satire of JUVENAL.</HEAD>

<P>This poem of Mr. Johnson's is the best imitation of the original that has appeared in our language, being possessed of all the force and satyrical re∣sentment of Juvenal. Imitation gives us a much truer idea of the ancients than even translation could do.</P>

<L>THO' grief and fondness in my breast rebel,</L>
<L>When injur'd Thales bids the town farewel,</L>
<L>Yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend,</L>
<L>I praise the hermit, but regret the friend;</L>
<L>Who now resolves, from vice and London far,</L>
<L>To breathe in distant fields a purer air,</L>
<L>And, fix'd on Cambria's solitary shore,</L>
<L>Give to St. David one true Briton more.</L>
<L>For who wou'd leave, unbrib'd, Hibernia's land,</L>
<L>Or change the rocks of Scotland for the Strand?</L>
<L>There none are swept by sudden fate away,</L>
<L>But all, whom hunger spares, with age decay:</L>
<L>Here malice, rapine, accident, conspire;</L>
<L>And now a rabble rages, now a fire:</L>
<L>Their ambush here relentless ruffians lay,</L>
<L>And here the fell attorney prowls for prey:</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="64"/>Here falling houses thunder on your head,</L>
<L>And here a female atheist talks you dead.</L>
<L>While Thales waits the wherry that contains</L>
<L>Of dissipated wealth the small remains,</L>
<L>On Thames's bank in silent thought we stood,</L>
<L>Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver flood.</L>
<L>Struck with the seat that gave Eliza birth,</L>
<L>We kneel, and kiss the consecrated earth;</L>
<L>In pleasing dreams the blissful age renew,</L>
<L>And call Britannia's glories back to view;</L>
<L>Behold her cross triumphant on the main,</L>

<HEAD>THE SCHOOL-MISTRESS. In Imitation of SPENCER.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>This poem is one of those happinesses in which a poet excels himself, as there is nothing in all Shenstone which any way approaches it in merit; and, though I dislike the imitations of our old English poets in general, yet, on this minute subject, the antiquity of the style produces a very ludicrous solemnity.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<LG>
<L>AH me! full sorely is my heart forlorn,</L>
<L>To think how modest worth neglected lies;</L>
<L>While partial Fame doth with her blasts adorn</L>
<L>Such deeds alone as pride and pomp disguise;</L>
<L>Deeds of ill sort, and mischievous emprize:</L>
<L>Lend me thy clarion, goddess! let me try</L>
<L>To sound the praise of merit, ere it dies!</L>
<L>Such as I oft have chaunced to espy,</L>
<L>Lost in the dreary shades of dull obscurity.</L>

<L>In ev'ry village mark'd with little spire,</L>
<L>Embower'd in trees, and hardly known to fame,</L>
<L>There dwells, in lowly shed, and mean attire,</L>
<L>A matron old, whom we school-mistress name;</L>
<L>Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame;</L>
<L>They grieven sore, in piteous durance pent,</L>
<L>Aw'd by the pow'r of this relentless dame;</L>
<L>And oft-times on vagaries idly bent,</L>
<L>For unkempt hair, or task unconn'd, are sorely shent.</L>

<L>And work the simple vassals mickle woe;</L>
<L>For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew,</L>
<L>But their limbs shudder'd, and their pulse beat low;</L>

<HEAD>COOPER's HILL.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>This poem, by Denham, though it may have been exceeded by later attempts in description, yet deserves the highest applause, as it far surpasses all that went before it: the concluding part, though a little too much crowded, is very mas∣terly.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>SURE there are poets which did never dream</L>
<L>Upon Parnassus, nor did taste the stream</L>
<L>Of Helicon; we, therefore, may suppose</L>
<L>Those made not poets, but the poets those.</L>
<L>And, as courts make not kings, but kings the court,</L>
<L>So, where the muses and their train resort,</L>
<L>Parnassus stands; if I can be to thee</L>
<L>A poet, thou Parnassus art to me.</L>
<L>Nor wonder, if (advantag'd in my flight,</L>
<L>By taking wing from thy auspicious height)</L>
<L>Through untrac'd ways and airy paths I fly,</L>
<L>More boundless in my fancy than my eye;</L>
<L>My eye, which, swift as thought, contracts the space</L>
<L>That lies between, and first salutes the place</L>
<L>Crown'd with that sacred pile, so vast, so high,</L>
<L>That, whether 'tis a part of earth, or sky,</L>
<L>Uncertain seems, and may be thought a proud</L>
<L>Aspiring mountain, or descending cloud;</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="86"/>Paul's, the late theme of such a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Waller.</NOTE> muse, whose flight</L>
<L>Has bravely reach'd and soar'd above thy height:</L>
<L>Now shalt thou stand, tho' sword, or time, or fire,</L>
<L>Or zeal, more fierce than they, thy fall conspire;</L>
<L>Secure, whilst thee the best of poets sings,</L>
<L>Preserv'd from ruin by the best of kings.</L>
<L>Under his proud survey the city lies,</L>
<L>And, like a mist, beneath a hill doth rise;</L>
<L>Whose state and wealth, the business and the crowd,</L>
<L>Seems, at this distance, but a darker cloud:</L>
<L>And is, to him who rightly things esteems,</L>
<L>No other in effect than what it seems;</L>
<L>Where, with like haste, tho' sev'ral ways they run,</L>
<L>Some to undo, and some to be undone;</L>
<L>While luxury and wealth, like war and peace,</L>
<L>Are each the other's ruin, and increase;</L>
<L>As rivers lost in seas, some secret vein</L>
<L>Thence reconveys, there to be lost again.</L>
<L>Oh happiness of sweet retir'd content!</L>
<L>To be at once secure, and innocent.</L>
<L>Windsor the next (where Mars with Venus dwells,</L>
<L>Beauty with strength) above the valley swells</L>
<L>Into my eye, and doth itself present</L>
<L>With such an easy and unforc'd ascent,</L>
<L>That no stupendious precipice denies</L>
<L>Access, no horror turns away our eyes;</L>
<L>But such a rise, as doth at once invite</L>
<L>A pleasure, and a rev'rence from the sight.</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="87"/>Thy mighty master's emblem, in whose face</L>
<L>Sate meekness, heighten'd with majestic grace;</L>
<L>Such seems thy gentle height, made only proud</L>
<L>To be the basis of that pompous load,</L>
<L>Than which, a nobler weight no mountain bears,</L>
<L>But Atlas only, which supports the spheres.</L>
<L>When nature's hand this ground did thus advance,</L>
<L>'Twas guided by a wiser power than Chance;</L>
<L>Mark'd out for such an use, as if 'twere meant</L>
<L>T' invite the builder, and his choice prevent.</L>
<L>Nor can we call it choice, when, what we chuse,</L>
<L>Folly or blindness only cou'd refuse.</L>
<L>A crown of such majestic tow'rs does grace</L>
<L>The gods great mother, when her heav'nly race</L>
<L>Do homage to her; yet she cannot boast,</L>
<L>Among that num'rous and celestial host,</L>
<L>More heroes than can Windsor; nor doth Fame's</L>
<L>Immortal book record more noble names.</L>
<L>Not to look back so far, to whom this isle</L>
<L>Owes the first glory of so brave a pile,</L>
<L>Whether to Caesar, Albanact, or Brute,</L>
<L>The British Arthur, or the Danish Knute,</L>

<L>(Like him in birth, thou should'st be like in fame,</L>
<L>As thine his fate, if mine had been his flame)</L>
<L>But whosoe'er it was, nature design'd</L>
<L>First a brave place, and then as brave a mind.</L>
<L>Not to recount those sev'ral kings, to whom</L>
<L>It gave a cradle, or to whom a tomb,</L>

<L>And brought that son, which did the second bring.</L>
<L>Then didst thou found that order (whether love</L>
<L>Or victory thy royal thoughts did move)</L>
<L>Each was a noble cause, and nothing less</L>
<L>Than the design, has been the great success:</L>
<L>Which foreign kings, and emperors esteem</L>
<L>The second honour to their diadem.</L>
<L>Had thy great destiny but giv'n thee skill</L>
<L>To know, as well as pow'r to act, her will,</L>
<L>That, from those kings who then thy captives were,</L>
<L>In after-times should spring a royal pair,</L>
<L>Who should possess all that thy mighty pow'r,</L>
<L>Or thy desires, more mighty, did devour;</L>
<L>To whom their better fate reserves whate'er</L>
<L>The victor hopes for, or the vanquish'd fear;</L>
<L>That blood, which thou and thy great grandsire shed,</L>
<L>And all that since these sister nations bled,</L>
<L>Had been unspilt, had happy Edward known</L>
<L>That all the blood he spilt had been his own.</L>
<L>When he that patron chose, in whom are join'd</L>
<L>Soldier and martyr, and his arms confin'd</L>
<L>Within the azure circle, he did seem</L>
<L>But to foretel, and prophesy of him,</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="89"/>Who to his realms that azure round hath join'd,</L>
<L>Which nature for their bound at first design'd:</L>
<L>That bound, which, to the world's extremest ends,</L>
<L>Endless itself, its liquid arms extends:</L>
<L>Nor doth he need those emblems which we paint,</L>
<L>But is himself the soldier and the saint.</L>
<L>Here should my wonder dwell, and here my praise,</L>
<L>But my fix'd thoughts my wond'ring eye betrays</L>
<L>Viewing a neighb'ring hill, whose top of late</L>
<L>A chapel crown'd, 'till, in the common fate,</L>
<L>Th' adjoining abbey fell: (may no such storm</L>
<L>Fall on our times, where ruin must reform.)</L>
<L>Tell me, my muse, what monstrous dire offence,</L>
<L>What crime, could any Christian king incense</L>
<L>To such a rage? Was't luxury, or lust?</L>
<L>Was he so temperate, so chaste, to just?</L>
<L>Were these their crimes? They were his own much more:</L>
<L>But wealth is crime enough to him that's poor;</L>
<L>Who, having spent the treasures of his crown,</L>
<L>Condemns their luxury to feed his own.</L>
<L>And yet this act, to varnish o'er the shame</L>
<L>Of sacrilege, must bear Devotion's name.</L>
<L>No crime so bold, but would be understood</L>
<L>A real, or, at least, a seeming good.</L>
<L>Who fears not to do ill, yet fears the name,</L>
<L>And free from conscience, is a slave to fame.</L>
<L>Thus, he the church at once protects, and spoils:</L>
<L>But princes' swords are sharper than their stiles.</L>
<L>And thus to th' ages past he makes amends,</L>
<L>Their charity destroys, their faith defends.</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="90"/>Then did religion, in a lazy cell,</L>
<L>In empty, airy contemplations dwell;</L>
<L>And, like the block, unmoved lay: but ours,</L>
<L>As much too active, like the stork devours.</L>
<L>Is there no temp'rate region can be known,</L>
<L>Betwixt their frigid, and our torrid, zone?</L>
<L>Cou'd we not wake from that lethargic dream,</L>
<L>But to be restless in a worse extreme?</L>
<L>And, for that lethargy, was there no cure,</L>
<L>But to be cast into a calenture?</L>
<L>Can knowledge have no bound, but must advance</L>
<L>So far, to make us wish for ignorance;</L>
<L>And rather in the dark to grope our way,</L>
<L>Than, led by a false guide, to err by day?</L>
<L>Who sees these dismal heaps, but would demand</L>
<L>What barbarous invader sack'd the land?</L>
<L>But when he hears, no Goth, no Turk, did bring</L>
<L>This desolation, but a Christian king;</L>
<L>When nothing but the name of Zeal appears,</L>
<L>'Twixt our best actions, and the worst of theirs,</L>
<L>What does he think our sacrilege wou'd spare,</L>
<L>When such the effects of our devotions are?</L>
<L>Parting from thence, 'twixt anger, shame, and fear,</L>

<L>My eye, descending from the hill, surveys</L>
<L>Where Thames among the wanton vallies strays.</L>
<L>Thames, the most lov'd of all the ocean's sons</L>
<L>By his old sire, to his embraces runs,</L>
<L>Hasting to pay his tribute to the sea,</L>
<L>Like mortal life to meet eternity.</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="91"/>Tho' with those streams he no resemblance hold,</L>
<L>Whose foam is amber, and their gravel gold;</L>
<L>His genuine and less guilty wealth t'explore,</L>
<L>Search not his bottom, but survey his shore;</L>
<L>O'er which he kindly spreads his spacious wing,</L>
<L>And hatches plenty for th'ensuing spring:</L>
<L>Nor then destroys it with too fond a stay,</L>
<L>Like mothers which their infants overlay;</L>
<L>Nor, with a sudden and impetuous wave,</L>
<L>Like profuse kings, resumes the wealth he gave.</L>
<L>No unexpected inundations spoil</L>
<L>The mower's hopes, or mock the ploughman's toil:</L>
<L>But, godlike, his unwearied bounty flows;</L>
<L>First loves to do, then loves the good he does.</L>
<L>Nor are his blessings to his banks confin'd,</L>
<L>But free and common as the sea, or wind;</L>
<L>When he to boast, or to disperse his stores,</L>
<L>Full of the tributes of his grateful shores,</L>
<L>Visits the world, and, in his flying towers,</L>

<L>Finds wealth where 'tis, bestows it where it wants,</L>

<L>Form, order, beauty, through the universe;</L>
<L>While dryness, moisture, coldness heat resists,</L>
<L>All that we have, and that we are, subsists.</L>
<L>While the steep horrid roughness of the wood,</L>
<L>Strives with the gentle calmness of the flood,</L>
<L>Such huge extremes when nature doth unite,</L>
<L>Wonder from thence results, from thence delight.</L>
<L>The stream is to transparent, pure, and clear,</L>
<L>That, had the self-enamour'd youth gaz'd here,</L>
<L>So fatally deceiv'd he had not been,</L>
<L>While he the bottom, not his face, had seen.</L>
<L>But his proud head the airy mountain hides</L>
<L>Among the clouds; his shoulders, and his sides,</L>
<L>A shady mantle cloathes; his curled brows</L>
<L>Frown on the gentle stream, which calmly flows,</L>
<L>While winds and storms his lofty forehead beat:</L>
<L>The common fate of all that's high or great.</L>
<L>Low at his foot a spacious plain is plac'd,</L>
<L>Between the mountain and the stream embrac'd:</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="93"/>Which shade and shelter from the hill derives,</L>
<L>While the kind river wealth and beauty gives;</L>
<L>And in the mixture of all these appears</L>
<L>Variety, which all the rest indears.</L>
<L>This scene had some bold Greek, or British bard,</L>
<L>Beheld of old, what stories had we heard,</L>
<L>Of fairies, satyrs, and the nymphs their dames,</L>
<L>Their feasts, their revels, and their am'rous flames?</L>
<L>'Tis still the same, altho' their airy shape</L>
<L>All but a quick poetic sight escape.</L>
<L>There Faunus and Sylvanus keep their courts,</L>
<L>And thither all the horned host resorts,</L>
<L>To graze the ranker mead; that noble herd,</L>
<L>On whose sublime and shady fronts is rear'd</L>
<L>Nature's great master-piece, to shew how soon</L>
<L>Great things are made, but sooner are undone.</L>
<L>Here have I seen the king, when great affairs</L>
<L>Gave leave to slacken and unbend his cares,</L>
<L>Attended to the chase by all the flow'r</L>
<L>Of youth, whose hopes a noble prey devour:</L>
<L>Pleasure with praise, and danger they would buy,</L>
<L>And wish a foe that would not only fly.</L>
<L>The stag, now conscious of his fatal growth,</L>
<L>At once indulgent to his fear and sloth,</L>
<L>To some dark covert his retreat had made,</L>
<L>Where nor man's eye, nor Heaven's should invade</L>
<L>His soft repose; when th' unexpected sound</L>
<L>Of dogs, and men, his wakeful ear does wound:</L>
<L>Rouz'd with the noise, he scarce believes his ear,</L>
<L>Willing to think th'illusions of his fear</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="94"/>Had giv'n this false alarm, but straight his view</L>
<L>Confirms, that more than all he fears is true.</L>
<L>Betray'd in all his strengths, the wood beset,</L>
<L>All instruments, all arts of ruin met;</L>
<L>He calls to mind his strength, and then his speed,</L>
<L>His winged heels, and then his armed head;</L>
<L>With these t'avoid, with that his fate to meet:</L>
<L>But fear prevails, and bids him trust his feet.</L>
<L>So fast he flies, that his reviewing eye</L>
<L>Has lost the chasers, and his ear the cry;</L>
<L>Exulting, 'till he finds, their nobler sense</L>
<L>Their disproportion'd speed does recompense;</L>
<L>Then curses his conspiring feet, whose scent</L>
<L>Betrays that safety which their swiftness lent.</L>
<L>Then tries his friends among the baser herd,</L>
<L>Where he so lately was obey'd and fear'd,</L>
<L>His safety seeks: the herd, unkindly wise,</L>
<L>Or chases him from thence, or from him flies;</L>
<L>Like a declining statesman, left forlorn,</L>
<L>To his friends pity, and pursuers scorn,</L>
<L>With shame remembers, while himself was one</L>
<L>Of the same herd, himself the same had done.</L>
<L>Thence to the coverts, and the conscious groves,</L>
<L>The scenes of his past triumphs, and his loves;</L>
<L>Sadly surveying where he rang'd alone</L>
<L>Prince of the soil, and all the herd his own;</L>
<L>And, like a bold knight-errant, did proclaim</L>
<L>Combat to all, and bore away the dame;</L>
<L>And taught the woods to echo to the stream</L>
<L>His dreadful challenge, and his clashing beam.</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="95"/>Yet faintly now declines the fatal strife;</L>
<L>So much his love was dearer than his life.</L>
<L>Now ev'ry leaf, and every moving breath,</L>
<L>Presents a foe, and ev'ry foe a death.</L>
<L>Weary'd, forsaken, and pursu'd, at last,</L>
<L>All safety in despair of safety plac'd;</L>
<L>Courage he thence resumes, resolv'd to bear</L>
<L>All their assaults, since 'tis in vain to fear.</L>
<L>And now, too late, he wishes, for the fight,</L>
<L>That strength he wasted in ignoble flight:</L>
<L>But, when he sees the eager chace renew'd,</L>
<L>Himself by dogs, the dogs by men pursu'd,</L>
<L>He strait revokes his bold resolve, and more</L>
<L>Repents his courage, than his fear before;</L>
<L>Finds that uncertain ways unsafest are,</L>
<L>And doubt a greater mischief than despair.</L>
<L>Then to the stream, when neither friends, nor force,</L>
<L>Nor speed, nor art avail, he shapes his course;</L>
<L>Thinks not their rage so desp'rate, to assay</L>
<L>An element more merciless than they.</L>
<L>But, fearless, they pursue, nor can the flood</L>
<L>Quench their dire thirst; alas, they thirst for blood.</L>
<L>So tow'rds a ship the oar-finn'd gallies ply,</L>
<L>Which wanting sea to ride, or wind to fly,</L>
<L>Stands but to fall reveng'd on those that dare</L>
<L>Tempt the last fury of extreme despair.</L>
<L>So fares the stag among th' enraged hounds,</L>
<L>Repels their force, and wounds returns for wounds.</L>
<L>And as a hero, whom his baser foes</L>
<L>In troops surround, now these assail, now those,</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="96"/>Though prodigal of life, disdains to die</L>
<L>By common hands; but, if he can descry</L>
<L>Some nobler foe approach, to him he calls,</L>
<L>And begs his fate, and then contented falls.</L>
<L>So when the king a mortal shaft lets fly</L>
<L>From his unerring hand, then, glad to die,</L>
<L>Proud of the wound, to it resigns his blood,</L>
<L>And stains the crystal with a purple flood.</L>
<L>This a more innocent, and happy chase</L>
<L>Than when of old, but in the self-same place,</L>
<L>Fair Liberty, pursu'd, and meant a prey</L>
<L>To lawless power, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Runnimede; where that great charter was first sealed.</NOTE> here turn'd, and stood at bay.</L>
<L>When in that remedy all hope was plac'd,</L>

<L>Here was that charter seal'd, wherein the crown</L>
<L>All marks of arbitrary pow'r lays down:</L>
<L>Tyrant and slave, those names of hate and fear,</L>
<L>The happier stile of king and subject bear:</L>
<L>Happy, when both to the same center move,</L>
<L>When kings give liberty, and subjects love.</L>
<L>Therefore not long in force this charter stood;</L>

<HEAD>ELOISA TO ABELARD.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>The harmony of numbers in this poem is very fine. It is rather drawn out to too tedious a length, altho' the passions vary with great judgement. It may be considered as superior to any thing in the epistolary way; and the many translations which have been made of it into the modern languages, are, in some measure, a proof of this.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>IN these deep solitudes and awful cells,</L>
<L>Where heav'nly-pensive contemplation dwells,</L>
<L>And ever-musing melancholy reigns;</L>
<L>What means this tumult in a vestal's veins?</L>
<L>Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?</L>
<L>Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?</L>
<L>Yet, yet I love!—From Abelard it came,</L>
<L>And Eloïsa yet must kiss the name.</L>
<L>Dear, fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,</L>
<L>Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd:</L>
<L>Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise,</L>
<L>Where, mix'd with God's, his lov'd idea lies:</L>
<L>O write it not, my hand—the name appears</L>
<L>Already written—wash it out, my tears!</L>
<L>In vain lost Eloïsa weeps and prays,</L>
<L>Her heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.</L>
<L>Relentless walls! whose darksome round contains</L>
<L>Repentant sighs, and voluntary pains:</L>
<L><PB N="96" REF="99"/>Ye rugged rocks! which holy knees have worn;</L>
<L>Ye grots and caverns, shagg'd with horrid thorn!</L>
<L>Shrines! where their vigils pale-ey'd virgins keep,</L>
<L>And pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep!</L>
<L>Tho' cold like you, unmov'd and silent grown,</L>
<L>I have not yet forgot myself to stone.</L>
<L>All is not Heav'n's, while Abelard has part,</L>
<L>Still rebel Nature holds out half my heart;</L>
<L>Nor pray'rs, nor fasts, its stubborn pulse restrain,</L>
<L>Nor tears, for ages taught to flow in vain.</L>
<L>Soon as thy letters, trembling, I unclose,</L>
<L>That well-known name awakens all my woes.</L>
<L>Oh name for ever sad! for ever dear!</L>
<L>Still breath'd in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.</L>
<L>I tremble, too, where-e'er my own I find,</L>
<L>Some dire misfortune follows close behind.</L>
<L>Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow,</L>
<L>Led thro' a sad variety of woe;</L>
<L>Now warm in love, now with'ring in my bloom,</L>
<L>Lost in a convent's solitary gloom!</L>
<L>There stern Religion quench'd th' unwilling flame,</L>
<L>There dy'd the best of passions, Love and Fame.</L>
<L>Yet write, oh write me all, that I may join</L>
<L>Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine.</L>
<L>Nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away;</L>
<L>And is my Abelard less kind than they?</L>
<L>Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare,</L>
<L>Love but demands what else were shed in pray'r;</L>
<L>No happier task these faded eyes pursue;</L>
<L>To read and weep is all they now can do.</L>
<L><PB N="97" REF="100"/>Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief;</L>
<L>Ah, more than share it, give me all thy grief.</L>
<L>Heav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid,</L>
<L>Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid;</L>
<L>They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,</L>
<L>Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires,</L>
<L>The virgin's wish without her fears impart,</L>
<L>Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,</L>
<L>Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,</L>
<L>And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.</L>
<L>Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame,</L>
<L>When Love approach'd me under Friendship's name;</L>
<L>My fancy form'd thee of angelic kind,</L>
<L>Some emanation of th' All-beauteous Mind.</L>
<L>Those smiling eyes, attemp'ring ev'ry ray,</L>
<L>Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day.</L>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>Few poems have done more honour to English ge∣nius than this. There is in it a strain of po∣litical thinking that was, at that time, new in our poetry. Had the harmony of this been equal to that of Pope's versification, it would be in∣contestibly the finest poem in our language; but there is a dryness in the numbers which greatly lessens the pleasure excited both by the poet's judgement and imagination.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>These are Mr. Gay's principal performance. They were originally intended, I suppose, as a bur∣lesque on those of Philips; but, perhaps without designing it, he has hit the true spirit of pastoral poetry. In fact, he more resembles Theocritus than any other English pastoral writer whatso∣ever. There runs through the whole a strain of rustic pleasantry which should ever distinguish this species of composition; but how far the an∣tiquated expressions used here may contribute to the humour, I will not determine; for my own part, I could wish the simplicity were preserved, without recurring to such obsolete antiquity for the manner of expressing it.</P>

<L>My sheep were silly, but more silly I;</L>

<L>White as the curd my ruddy cheek is grown,</L>

<L>Our neighbours tell me oft, in joking talk,</L>

<L>Strait on the fire the sooty pot I plac'd;</L>
<L>To warm thy broth I burnt my hands for haste.</L>
<L>When, hungry, thou stood'st staring, like an oaf,</L>

<L>Next morn I miss'd three hens and our old cock,</L>

<L>When dying embers were our only light,</L>
<L>When ev'ry creature did in slumbers lie,</L>
<L>Besides our cat, my Collin Clout, and I?</L>
<L>No troublous thoughts the cat or Collin move,</L>
<L>While I alone am kept awake by love.</L>
<L>Remember, Collin, when at last year's wake,</L>
<L>I bought the costly present for thy sake;</L>
<L>Couldst thou spell o'er the posie on thy knife,</L>

<HEAD>MAC FLECKNOE.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>The severity of this satire, and the excellence of its versification, give it a distinguished rank in this species of composition. At present, an ordinary reader would scarce suppose that Shadwell, who is here meant by Mac Flecknoe, was worth being chastised, and that Dryden's descending to such game was like an eagle's stooping to catch flies. The truth, however, is, Shadwell, at one time, held divided reputation with this great poet. Every age produces its fashionable dunces, who, by following the transient topic, or humour, of the day, supply talkative ignorance with materials for conversation.</P>

<L>Worn out with business, did, at length debate</L>

<L>The rest, to some faint meaning make pretence;</L>
<L>But Sh— never deviates into sense.</L>
<L>Some beams of wit on other souls may fall,</L>

<L>Besides, his goodly fabric fills the eye,</L>

<L>To teach the nations in thy greater name.</L>
<L>My warbling lute, the lute I whilom strung,</L>
<L>When to king John of Portugal I sung,</L>
<L>Was but the prelude to that glorious day,</L>
<L>When thou on silver Thames didst cut thy way,</L>
<L>With well-tim'd oars, before the royal barge,</L>
<L>Swell'd with the pride of thy celestial charge;</L>
<L>And, big with hymn, commander of an host,</L>

<L>The lute still trembling underneath thy nail.</L>
<L>At thy well-sharpen'd thumb, from shore to shore</L>
<L>The trebles squeak for fear, the bases roar:</L>
<L>Echoes from Pissing-Alley Sh— call,</L>

<L>About thy boat the little fishes throng,</L>
<L>As at the morning toast that floats along.</L>
<L>Sometimes, as prince of thy harmonious band,</L>
<L>Thou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand.</L>
<L>St. Andre's feet ne'er kept more equal time,</L>

<L>So just, so like Tautology they fell,</L>
<L>That, pale with envy, Singleton forswore</L>
<L>The lute and sword, which he in triumph bore,</L>
<L>And vow'd he ne'er wou'd act Villerius more.</L>
<L>Here stopt the good old sire, and wept for joy,</L>
<L>In silent raptures of the hopeful boy.</L>
<L>All arguments, but most his plays, persuade,</L>
<L>That for anointed dulness he was made.</L>
<L>Close to the walls which fair Augusta bind,</L>
<L>(The fair Augusta, much to fears inclin'd)</L>
<L>An antient fabric, rais'd t' inform the sight,</L>
<L>There stood of yore, and Barbican it hight;</L>
<L>A watch-tow'r once; but now, so fate ordains,</L>
<L>Of all the pile an empty name remains:</L>
<L>From its old ruins brothel-houses rise,</L>
<L>Scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys,</L>
<L><PB N="170" REF="171"/>Where their vast courts the mother-strumpets keep,</L>
<L>And, undisturb'd by watch, in silence sleep.</L>
<L>Near these a nursery erects its head,</L>
<L>Where queens are form'd, and future heroes bred;</L>
<L>Where unfledg'd actors learn to laugh and cry,</L>
<L>Where infant punks their tender voices try,</L>
<L>And little Maximins the Gods defy.</L>
<L>Great Fletcher never treads in buskins here,</L>
<L>Nor greater Johnson dares in socks appear;</L>
<L>But gentle Simkin just reception finds</L>
<L>Amidst this monument of vanish'd minds:</L>
<L>Pure clinches the suburbian muse affords,</L>
<L>And Panton waging harmless war with words.</L>
<L>Here Flecknoe, as a place to fame well known,</L>
<L>Ambitiously design'd his Sh—'s throne:</L>
<L>For ancient Decker prophesy'd, long since,</L>
<L>That in this pile should reign a mighty prince,</L>
<L>Born for a scourge of Wit, and flail of sense:</L>
<L>To whom true dulness should some Psyche's owe,</L>
<L>But worlds of Misers from his pen should flow;</L>
<L>Humourists and Hypocrites it should produce,</L>
<L>Whole Raymond families, and tribes of Bruce.</L>
<L>Now empress Fame had publish'd the renown</L>
<L>Of Sh—'s coronation through the town.</L>
<L>Rouz'd by report of Fame, the nations meet,</L>
<L>From near Bun-hill, and distant Watling-street.</L>
<L>No Persian carpets spread th' imperial way,</L>
<L>But scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay:</L>
<L>From dusty shops neglected authors come,</L>
<L>Martyrs of pies, and reliques of the bum.</L>
<L><PB N="171" REF="172"/>Much Heywood, Shirley, Ogleby, there lay;</L>
<L>But loads of Sh— almost choak'd the way.</L>
<L>Bilk'd Stationers for yeomen stood prepar'd,</L>
<L>And H—n was captain of the guard.</L>
<L>The hoary prince in majesty appear'd,</L>
<L>High on a throne of his own labours rear'd.</L>
<L>At his right hand our young Ascanius sate,</L>
<L>Rome's other hope, and pillar of the state.</L>
<L>His brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace,</L>
<L>And lambent Dulness play'd around his face.</L>
<L>As Hannibal did to the altars come,</L>
<L>Swore by his sire a mortal foe to Rome;</L>
<L>So Sh— swore, nor should his vow be vain,</L>
<L>That he, till death, true dulness would maintain;</L>
<L>And, in his father's right, and realm's defence,</L>
<L>Ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense.</L>
<L>The king himself the sacred unction made,</L>
<L>As king by office, and as priest by trade.</L>
<L>In his sinister hand, instead of ball,</L>
<L>He plac'd a mighty mug of potent ale;</L>
<L>Love's kingdom to his right he did convey,</L>
<L>At once his sceptre, and his rule of sway;</L>
<L>Whose righteous lore the prince had practis'd young,</L>
<L>And from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung.</L>
<L>His temples, last, with poppies were o'erspread,</L>
<L>That, nodding, seem'd to consecrate his head.</L>
<L>Just at the point of time, if fame not lye,</L>
<L>On his left hand twelve rev'rend owls did fly.</L>
<L>So Romulus, 'tis sung, by Tyber's brook,</L>
<L>Presage of sway from twice six vultures took.</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="173"/>Th' admiring throng loud acclamations make,</L>
<L>And omens of his future empire take.</L>
<L>The sire then shook the honours of his head,</L>
<L>And from his brows damps of oblivion shed</L>
<L>Full on the filial dullness: long he stood,</L>
<L>Repelling from his breast the raging god;</L>
<L>At length burst out in this prophetic mood:</L>
<L>"Heav'ns bless my son, from Ireland let him reign</L>
<L>To far Barbadoes on the western main;</L>
<L>Of his dominion may no end be known,</L>
<L>And greater than his father's be his throne;</L>
<L>Beyond Love's kingdom let him stretch his pen!"—</L>
<L>He paus'd, and all the people cry'd, Amen.</L>
<L>Then thus continu'd he: "My son, advance</L>

<L>Where sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my arse,</L>

<L>Sinking, he left his drugget robe behind,</L>

<HEAD>ON POETRY. A RHAPSODY.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Here follows one of the best versified poems in our language, and the most masterly produc∣tion of its author. The severity with which Walpole is here treated, was in consequence of that minister's having refused to provide for Swift in England, when applied to for that purpose in the year 1725 (if I remember right). The se∣verity of a poet, however, gave Walpole very little uneasiness. A man whose schemes, like this minister's, seldom extended beyond the exi∣gency of the year, but little regarded the con∣tempt of posterity.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>ALL human race would fain be wits,</L>
<L>And millions miss for one that hits.</L>
<L>Young's universal passion, pride,</L>
<L>Was never known to spread so wide.</L>
<L>Say, Britain, could you ever boast</L>
<L>Three poets in an age, at most?</L>
<L>Our chilling climate hardly bears</L>
<L>A sprig of bays in fifty years:</L>
<L><PB N="176" REF="177"/>While ev'ry fool his claim alledges,</L>
<L>As if it grew in common hedges.</L>
<L>What reason can there be assign'd</L>

<L>Brutes find out where their talents lie:</L>
<L>A bear will not attempt to fly;</L>
<L>A founder'd horse will oft debate</L>
<L>Before he tries a five-barr'd gate:</L>
<L>A dog, by instinct, turns aside,</L>
<L>Who sees the ditch too deep and wide.</L>
<L>But man we find the only creature,</L>
<L>Who, led by folly, combats nature;</L>
<L>Who, when she loudly cries forbear,</L>
<L>With obstinacy fixes there;</L>
<L>And, where his genius least inclines,</L>
<L>Absurdly bends his whole designs.</L>
<L>Not empire to the rising sun,</L>
<L>By valour, conduct, fortune won;</L>
<L>Not highest wisdom in debates</L>
<L>For framing laws to govern states;</L>
<L>Not skill in sciences profound,</L>

<L>As how to strike the Muse's lyre.</L>
<L>Not beggar's brat, on bulk begot;</L>
<L>Not bastard of a pedlar Scot;</L>
<L>Not boy brought up to cleaning shoes,</L>
<L>The spawn of Bridewell, or the stews;</L>
<L>Not infants dropt, the spurious pledges</L>
<L>Of gipsies litt'ring under hedges,</L>

<L>To rise in church, or law, or state,</L>

<L>Where you have nothing to produce</L>
<L>For private life, or public use?</L>

<L>So, after toiling twenty days</L>

<L>How shall a new attempter learn</L>

<L>What subject you can manage best;</L>
<L>Whether your genius most inclines</L>
<L>To satyre, praise, or hum'rous lines;</L>
<L>To elegies in mournful tone,</L>
<L>Or prologue, sent from hand unknown.</L>
<L>Then, rising with Aurora's light,</L>
<L>The muse invok'd, sit down to write;</L>
<L>Blot out, correct, insert, refine,</L>
<L>Enlarge, diminish, interline;</L>
<L>Be mindful, when invention fails,</L>
<L>To scratch your head, and bite your nails.</L>
<L>Your poem finish'd, next, your care</L>
<L>Is needful to transcribe it fair.</L>
<L>In modern wit all printed trash is</L>
<L>Set off with num'rous breaks—and dashes—</L>

He was suspected of joining in a conveyance with Sir John Blunt, to se∣crete 50,000l. of that director's estate, forfeited to the South-Sea company by act of parliament. The company recovered the 50,000 l. against Ward; but he set up prior conveyances of his real estate to his brother and son, and concealed all his personal, which was computed to be 150,000 l. These con∣veyances being also set aside by a bill in Chancery, Ward was imprisoned, and hazarded the forfeiture of his life by not giving in his effects till the last day, which was that of his examination. During his confinement, his amusement was to give poison to dogs and cats, and see them expire by flower or quicker torments. To sum up the worth of this gentleman at the several aera's of his life; at his standing in the pillory he was worth above 200,000 l. at his commitment to prison he was worth 150,000 l. but has since been so far diminished in his reputa∣tion, as to be thought a worse man by 50 or 60,000 l.</P><P>Fr. Chartres, a man infamous for all manner of vice. When he was an ensign in the army, he was drummed out of the regiment for a cheat: he was next banished Brussels, and drummed out of Ghent on the same account. After a hundred tricks at the gaming tables, he took to lending of money at exorbitant interest, and on great penalties, accu∣mulating praemium, interest, and capital, into a new capital, and seizing, to a minute, when the payments became due. In a word, by a constant attention to the vices, wants, and follies of man∣kind, he acquired an immense fortune. His house was a perpetual bawdy-house. He was twice con∣demned for rapes, and pardoned; but, the last time, not without imprisonment in Newgate, and large confiscations. He died in Scotland in 1731, aged 62. The populace, at his funeral, raised a great riot, almost tore the body out of the coffin, and cast dead dogs, &amp;c. into the grave along with it. The following epitaph contains his character, very justly drawn, by Dr. Arbuthnot.</P><LG>

<HEAD>FROM THE DISPENSARY. CANTO VI.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>This sixth canto of the Dispensary, by Dr. Garth, has more merit than the whole preceding part of the poem, and, as I am told, in the first edition of this work it is more correct than as here ex∣hibited; but that edition I have not been able to find. The praises bestowed, on this poem are more than have been given to any other; but our approbation, at present, is cooler, for it owed part of its fame to party.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>AND now the Delegate prepares to go</L>
<L>And view the wonders of the realms below.</L>
<L>Thrice did the goddess, with her sacred wand,</L>
<L>The pavement strike; and strait, at her command,</L>
<L>The willing surface opens, and descries</L>
<L>A deep descent, that leads to nether skies.</L>
<L>Hygeia to the silent region tends;</L>
<L>And, with his heav'nly guide; the Charge descends.</L>
<L>Thus Numa, when to hallow'd caves retir'd,</L>
<L>Was by Aegeria guarded and inspir'd.</L>
<L>Within the chambers of the globe they spy</L>
<L>The beds where sleeping vegetables lie,</L>
<L>Till the glad summons of a genial ray</L>
<L>Unbinds the glebe, and calls them out to day.</L>
<L><PB N="226" REF="226"/>Hence Pancies trick themselves in various hue,</L>
<L>And hence Junquils derive their fragrant dew;</L>
<L>Hence the Carnation, and the bashful Rose,</L>
<L>Their virgin blushes to the morn disclose.</L>
<L>Hence the chaste Lilly rises to the light,</L>
<L>Unveils her snowy breasts and charms the sight.</L>
<L>Hence arbours are with twining greens array'd,</L>
<L>T'oblige complaining lovers with their shade:</L>
<L>And hence on Daphne's laurel'd forehead grow</L>
<L>Immortal wreaths for Phoebus and Nassau.</L>
<L>The insects here their ling'ring trance survive:</L>
<L>Benumb'd they seem, and doubtful if alive.</L>
<L>From Winter's fury hither they repair,</L>
<L>And stay for milder skies and softer air.</L>
<L>Down to these cells obscener reptiles creep;</L>
<L>Where hateful Nutes and painted Lizzards sleep.</L>
<L>Where shiv'ring Snakes the summer Solstice wait,</L>
<L>Unfurl their painted folds, and slide in state.</L>
<L>Here their new form the numb'd Erucae hide,</L>
<L>Their num'rous feet in slender bandage ty'd;</L>
<L>Soon as the kindling year begins to rise,</L>
<L>This upstart race their native clod despise,</L>
<L>And, proud of painted wings, attempt the skies.</L>
<L>Now those profounder regions they explore,</L>
<L>Where metals ripen in vast cakes of oar.</L>
<L>Here, sullen to the sight, at large is spread,</L>
<L>The dull unwieldy mass of lumpish Lead.</L>
<L>There, glimm'ring in their dawning beds, are seen</L>
<L>The aspiring seeds of sprightly Tin.</L>
<L>The Copper sparkles next in ruddy streaks;</L>
<L>And in the gloom betrays its glowing cheeks,</L>
<L><PB N="227" REF="227"/>The Silver, then, with bright and burnish'd grace,</L>
<L>Youth, and a blooming lustre in its face,</L>
<L>To th' arms of those more yielding metals flies,</L>
<L>And in the folds of their embraces lies:</L>
<L>So close they cling, so stubbornly retire,</L>
<L>Their love's more vi'lent than the chymist's fire.</L>
<L>Near these the Delegate, with wonder, spies</L>
<L>Where floods of living silver serpentize:</L>
<L>Where richest metals their bright looks put on,</L>
<L>And golden streams through amber channels run.</L>
<L>Where Light's gay God descends to ripen gems,</L>
<L>And lend a lustre brighter than his beams.</L>
<L>Here he observes the subterranean cells,</L>
<L>Where wanton nature sports in idle shells.</L>
<L>Some helicoeids, some conical appear;</L>
<L>These mitres emulate, those turbans are.</L>
<L>Here marcasites in various figure wait,</L>
<L>To ripen to a true metallic state:</L>
<L>Till drops, that from impending rocks descend,</L>
<L>Their substance petrify, and progress end.</L>
<L>Nigh, livid seas of kindled sulphur flow,</L>
<L>And whilst, enraged, their fiery surges glow,</L>
<L>Convulsions in the lab'ring mountains rise,</L>
<L>And hurl their melted vitals to the skies.</L>
<L>He views, with horror, next, the noisy cave,</L>
<L>Where, with hoarse dinns, imprison'd tempests rave;</L>
<L>Where clam'rous hurricanes attempt their, flight,</L>
<L>Or, whirling in tumultuous eddies, fight.</L>
<L>The warring winds, unmov'd, Hygeia heard,</L>
<L>Brav'd their loud jars, but much for Celsus fear'd.</L>
<L><PB N="228" REF="228"/>Andromeda, so, whilst her hero fought,</L>
<L>Shook for his danger, but her own forgot.</L>
<L>And now the goddess, with her charge, descends</L>
<L>Where scarce one chearful glimpse their steps be-friends.</L>
<L>Here his forsaken seat old Chaos keeps,</L>
<L>And, undisturb'd by Form, in silence sleeps.</L>
<L>A grisly wight, and hideous to the eye;</L>
<L>An aukward lump of shapeless anarchy.</L>
<L>With sordid age his features are defac'd;</L>
<L>His lands unpeopled, and his countries waste.</L>
<L>To these dark realms much learned lumber creeps;</L>
<L>There copious M— safe in silence sleeps.</L>
<L>Where mushroom libels in oblivion lie,</L>
<L>And, soon as born, like other monsters, die.</L>
<L>Upon a couch of jett, in these abodes,</L>
<L>Dull Night, his melancholy consort, nods.</L>
<L>No ways and means their cabinet employ;</L>
<L>But their dark hours they waste in barren joy.</L>
<L>Nigh this recess, with terror, they survey</L>
<L>Where Death maintains his dread tyrannic sway:</L>
<L>In the close covert of a cypress grove,</L>
<L>Where goblins frisk and airy spectres rove,</L>
<L>Yawns a dark cave, with awful horror, wide;</L>
<L>And there the monarch's triumphs are descry'd.</L>
<L>Confus'd, and wildly huddled, to the eye,</L>
<L>The beggar's pouch and prince's purple lie.</L>
<L>Dim lamps with sickly rays scarce seem to glow;</L>
<L>Sighs heave in mournful moans, and tears o'erflow.</L>
<L>Restless Anxiety, forlorn Despair,</L>
<L>And all the faded family of Care;</L>
<L><PB N="229" REF="229"/>Old mould'ring urns, racks, daggers, and distress,</L>
<L>Make up the frightful horror o' the place.</L>
<L>Within its dreadful jaws those furies wait,</L>
<L>Which execute the harsh decrees of Fate.</L>
<L>Febris is first: the hag relentless hears</L>
<L>The virgin's sighs, and sees the infant's tears;</L>
<L>In her parch'd eye-balls fiery meteors reign;</L>
<L>And restless ferments revel in each vein.</L>
<L>Then hydrops next appears amongst the throng;</L>
<L>Bloated, and big, she slowly sails along.</L>
<L>But, like a miser, in excess she's poor,</L>
<L>And pines for thirst amidst her watry store.</L>
<L>Now loathsome Lepra, that offensive spright,</L>
<L>With foul eruptions stain'd, offends the sight;</L>
<L>Still deaf to beauty's soft persuading pow'r:</L>
<L>Nor can bright Hebe's charms her bloom secure.</L>
<L>Whilst meager Pthisis gives a silent blow;</L>
<L>Her strokes are sure, but her advances slow.</L>
<L>No loud alarms, or fierce assaults, are shown:</L>
<L>She starves the fortress first, then takes the town.</L>
<L>Behind stood crowds of much inferior name;</L>
<L>Too numerous to repeat, too foul to name;</L>
<L>The vassals of their monarch's tyranny,</L>
<L>Who, at his nod, on fatal errands fly.</L>
<L>Now Celsus, with his glorious guide, invades</L>
<L>The silent region of the fleeting shades:</L>
<L>Where rocks and ruful desarts are descry'd;</L>
<L>And sullen Styx rolls down his lazy tide.</L>
<L>Then shews the ferry-man the plant he bore,</L>
<L>And claims his passage to the further shore.</L>
<L><PB N="230" REF="230"/>To whom the Stygian pilot, smiling, said,</L>
<L>You need no passport to demand our aid.</L>
<L>Physicians never linger on this strand:</L>

<L>To them the peopling of their realms below.</L>
<L>Then in his swarthy hand he grasp'd the oar,</L>
<L>Receiv'd his guests aboard, and shov'd from shore,</L>
<L>Now, as the goddess and her charge prepare</L>
<L>To breathe the sweets of soft Elysian air,</L>
<L>Upon the left they spy a pensive shade,</L>
<L>Who on his bended arm had rais'd his head;</L>
<L>Pale Grief sate heavy on his mournful look:</L>
<L>To whom, not unconcern'd, thus Celsus spoke:</L>
<L>Tell me, thou much afflicted shade, why sighs</L>
<L>Burst from your breast, and torrents from your eyes;</L>
<L>And who those mangled manes are, which show</L>
<L>A sullen satisfaction at your woe?</L>
<L>Since, said the ghost, with pity you'll attend,</L>
<L>Know, I'm Guâicum, once your firmest friend.</L>
<L>And on this barren beach, in discontent,</L>
<L>Am doom'd to stay, 'till th' angry powers relent.</L>
<L>Those spectres, seam'd with scars, that threaten there,</L>
<L>The victims of my late ill conduct are.</L>
<L>They vex, with endless clamours, my repose:</L>
<L>This wants his palate, that demands his nose:</L>
<L>And here they execute stern Pluto's will,</L>
<L>And ply me ev'ry moment with a pill.</L>
<L>Then Celsus thus, O much-lamented state!</L>
<L>How rigid is the sentence you relate?</L>
<L><PB N="231" REF="231"/>Methinks I recollect your former air;</L>
<L>But ah, how much you're chang'd from what you were!</L>
<L>Insipid as your late ptisans you lie,</L>
<L>That, once, were sprightlier far than Mercury.</L>
<L>At the sad tale you tell the poppies weep,</L>
<L>And mourn their vegetable souls asleep.</L>
<L>The unctuous Larix, and the healing Pine,</L>
<L>Lament your fate in tears of Turpentine;</L>
<L>But still the offspring of your brain shall prove</L>
<L>The grocer's care, and brave the rage of Jove.</L>
<L>When bonfires blaze your vagrant works shall rise</L>
<L>In rockets, till they reach the wond'ring skies.</L>
<L>If mortals e'er the Stygian pow'rs could bend,</L>
<L>Entreaties to their awful seats I'd send:</L>
<L>But, since no human arts the Fates dissuade,</L>
<L>Direct me how to find bless'd Hervey's shade.</L>
<L>In vain th' unhappy ghost still urg'd his stay:</L>
<L>Then, rising from the ground, he shew'd the way.</L>
<L>Nigh the dull shore a shapeless mountain stood,</L>
<L>That, with a dreadful frown, survey'd the flood</L>
<L>Its fearful brow no lively greens put on;</L>
<L>No frisking goats bound o'er the ridgy stone.</L>
<L>To gain the summit the bright goddess try'd,</L>
<L>And Celsus, follow'd, by degrees, his guide.</L>
<L>Th' ascent thus conquer'd, now they towre on high,</L>
<L>And taste th' indulgence of a milder sky.</L>
<L>Loose breezes on their airy pinions play,</L>
<L>Soft infant blossoms their chaste odours pay,</L>
<L>And roses blush their fragrant lives away.</L>
<L>Cool streams thro' flow'ry meadows gently glide;</L>
<L>And, as they pass, their painted banks they chide.</L>
<L><PB N="232" REF="232"/>These blissful plains no blights, nor mildews fear,</L>
<L>The flow'rs ne'er fade, and shrubs are myrtles here.</L>
<L>The morn awakes the tulip from her bed;</L>
<L>E'er noon, in painted pride she decks her head:</L>
<L>Rob'd in rich dye, she triumphs on the green,</L>
<L>And ev'ry flow'r does homage to their queen.</L>
<L>So, when bright Venus rises from the flood,</L>
<L>Around, in throngs, the wond'ring Nereids crowd;</L>
<L>The Tritons gaze, and tune each vocal shell,</L>
<L>And ev'ry grace unsung the waves conceal.</L>
<L>The Delegate observes, with wond'ring eyes,</L>
<L>Ambrosial dews descend, and incense rise.</L>
<L>Then hastens onward to the pensive grove,</L>
<L>The silent mansion of disastrous love.</L>
<L>Here Jealousy with jaundice looks appears,</L>
<L>And broken slumbers, and fantastic fears.</L>
<L>The widow'd Turtle hangs her moulting wings,</L>
<L>And to the woods, in mournful murmurs, sings.</L>
<L>No winds but sighs there are, no floods but tears.</L>
<L>Each conscious tree a tragic signal bears.</L>
<L>Their wounded bark records some broken vow,</L>
<L>And willow garlands hang on ev'ry bough.</L>
<L>Olivia, here, in solitude he found,</L>
<L>Her downcast eyes fix'd on the silent ground:</L>
<L>Her dress neglected, and unbound her hair,</L>
<L>She seem'd the dying image of despair.</L>
<L>How lately did this celebrated thing</L>
<L>Blaze in the box, and sparkle in the ring!</L>
<L>Till the Green-sickness, and Love's force, betray'd</L>
<L>To Death's remorseless arms th' unhappy maid.</L>
<L><PB N="233" REF="233"/>All o'er confus'd the guilty lover stood,</L>
<L>The light forsook his eyes, his cheeks the blood;</L>
<L>An icy horror shiver'd in his look,</L>
<L>As to the cold-complexion'd nymph he spoke:</L>
<L>"Tell me, dear shade, from whence such anxious care;</L>
<L>Your looks disorder'd, and your bosom bare?</L>
<L>Why thus you languish, like a drooping flow'r,</L>
<L>Crush'd by the weight of some relentless show'r?</L>
<L>Your languid looks your late ill-conduct tell;</L>
<L>O that, instead of trash, you'd taken steel!"</L>
<L>Stabb'd with th' unkind reproach, the conscious maid</L>
<L>Thus, to her late insulting lover said:</L>
<L>"When ladies listen not to loose desire,</L>
<L>You stile our modesty our want of fire.</L>
<L>Smile or forbid, encourage or reprove,</L>
<L>You still find reasons to believe we love:</L>

<L>Where heav'nly truth and tenderness conspire,</L>

<HEAD>ECLOGUE I. SELIM: OR THE SHEPHERD'S MORAL. SCENE, A VALLEY NEAR BAGDAT. TIME, THE MORNING.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>The following eclogues, written by Mr. Collins, are very pretty: the images, it must be owned, are not very local; for the pastoral subject could not well admit of it. The description of Asiatic mag∣nificence, and manners, is a subject as yet unat∣tempted amongst us, and, I believe, capable of furnishing a great variety of poetical imagery.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>YE Persian maids, attend your poet's lays,</L>
<L>And hear how shepherds pass their golden days.</L>
<L>Not all are blest, whom Fortune's hand sustains</L>
<L>With wealth, in courts, nor all that haunt the plains:</L>
<L>Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell;</L>
<L>'Tis virtue makes the bliss, where'er we dwell.</L>
<L>Thus Selim sung, by sacred Truth inspir'd;</L>
<L>Nor praise, but such as Truth bestow'd, desir'd:</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="239"/>Wise in himself, his meaning songs convey'd</L>
<L>Informing morals to the shepherd maid;</L>
<L>Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find,</L>
<L>What groves nor streams bestow, a virtuous mind.</L>
<L>When, sweet, and blushing like a virgin bride,</L>
<L>The radiant morn resum'd her orient pride;</L>
<L>When wanton gales along the valleys play,</L>
<L>Breathe on each flower, and bear their sweets away;</L>
<L>By Tigris' wandering waves he sat, and sung</L>
<L>This useful lesson for the fair and young.</L>
<L>Ye Persian dames, he said, to you belong,</L>
<L>Well may they please, the morals of my song:</L>
<L>No fairer maids, I trust, than you are found,</L>
<L>Grac'd with soft arts, the peopled world around!</L>
<L>The morn that lights you, to your loves supplies</L>
<L>Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes:</L>
<L>For you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow,</L>
<L>And yours the love that kings delight to know.</L>
<L>Yet think not these, all-beauteous as they are,</L>
<L>The best kind blessings Heaven can grant the fair!</L>
<L>Who trust alone in beauty's feeble ray,</L>
<L>Boast but the worth Bassora's pearls display;</L>
<L>Drawn from the deep we own their surface bright,</L>
<L>But, dark within, they drink no lustrous light:</L>
<L>Such are the maids, and such the charms they boast,</L>
<L>By sense unaided, or to virtue lost.</L>
<L>Self-flattering sex! your hearts believe in vain</L>
<L>That love shall blind, whence once he fires the swain;</L>
<L>Or hope a lover by your faults to win,</L>
<L>As spots on ermin beautify the skin:</L>
<L><PB N="241" REF="240"/>Who seeks secure to rule, be first her care</L>
<L>Each softer virtue that adorns the fair;</L>
<L>Each tender passion man delights to find,</L>
<L>The lov'd perfections of a female mind!</L>
<L>Blest were the days, when Wisdom held her reign,</L>
<L>And shepherds sought her on the silent plain;</L>
<L>With Truth she wedded in the secret grove,</L>
<L>Immortal Truth; and daughters bless'd their love.</L>
<L>O haste, fair maids! ye Virtues come away;</L>
<L>Sweet Seace and Plenty lead you on your way!</L>
<L>The balmy shrub for you shall love our shore,</L>
<L>By Ind excell'd, or Araby, no more.</L>
<L>Lost to our fields, for so the fates ordain,</L>
<L>The dear deserters shall return again.</L>
<L>Come thou, whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear,</L>
<L>To lead the train, sweet Modesty, appear:</L>
<L>Here make thy court, amidst our rural scene,</L>
<L>And shepherd-girls shall own thee for their queen.</L>
<L>With thee be Chastity, of all afraid,</L>
<L>Distrusting all; a wise, suspicious maid:</L>
<L>But man the most—not more the mountain doe</L>
<L>Holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe.</L>
<L>Cold is her breast, like flowers that drink the dew;</L>
<L>A silken veil conceals her from the view.</L>
<L>No wild desires amidst thy train be known,</L>
<L>But Faith, whose heart is fix'd on one alone;</L>
<L>Desponding Meekness, with her downcast eyes,</L>
<L>And friendly Pity, full of tender sighs;</L>
<L><PB N="242" REF="241"/>And Love the last: by these your hearts approve;</L>
<L>These are the virtues that must lead to love.</L>
