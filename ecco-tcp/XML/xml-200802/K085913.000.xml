<SPEAKER>Curt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear, you must bring in another Draught as fast as you can; <STAGE>[Calling to the Fisher∣men.]</STAGE> and do you leave the Nets a little, and see that the Fish is sorted as I directed you. <STAGE>[To the Girls.]</STAGE> Dear me, I've a great deal of Business to mind; but no Matter for that. And now, my Child, I want to talk to thee—Bless the Heart on thee, don't be dismayed; my Goodman has pro∣mised to let thee know, the Moment he hears any Tidings of thy Father; he likes thee well—and for that Matter, so do I too; but no Matter for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am pleased to hear you say so, and Las∣sure you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cur.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you was going to say: but there's no Occasion for your telling me, that you'll do every Thing you can to deserve it. I say it again, I love thee; but 'tis no Matter for that.—And 'tis not every young Girl would come so far after her Father: no, not if he was twenty Times over sold for a Slave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, me! If I could but find where he is, I should then be easy: but if I never find him, I shall always—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Curt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you was going to say; that you'd always remember our Civility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Curt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye there now, I said so; we under∣stand one another very well. And now tell me, what was that I cunningly drew from you, as we were walking last Night by the River's Side?—See how she blushes—Don't be asham'd, Child—the
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
more ready you was to part with your Lover, the more Duty you shewed for your Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why surely, I did not tell you any Thing that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Curt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you was going to say; that you did not, as one may say, tell me directly, who he is. Why, Child, I confess that; but I was once fifteen myself, and I remember very well, I was just such a sweet, little, tender, delicate Morsel, as you are now—I warrant, thou hast made a pru∣dent Choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Father thought so; for he consented that we should be married, upon my Lover's re∣turn from Sea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Curt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he a Sailor? I said you had made a pru∣dent Choice, my Husband has been a Sailor, and Heaven knows, we should now have been comfort∣ably settled in <HI>England,</HI> with the little we had got by the Sea, if upon our Voyage, we had not been taken by those wicked <HI>Algerines.</HI> We were made Slaves to the Great Bashaw, <HI>Abdallah,</HI> and my Husband worked in the Gardens, while I attended the Ladies of the Seraglio. But we were so kind∣ly used, that at last we plucked up Heart of Grace, and told the Bashaw all our Misfortunes. What do you think he did? He gave us our Li∣berty, set us up in this Business, and ever since we have served the whole Seraglio with Fish.—But if I stand idling here, I shall he scolded by my old Man—Ah! you smile at that—And well you may—He scold me!—Poor Soul—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, you seem very happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Curt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as he often says, People are never unhappy, but it is in some Measure their own Faults—Let me see—'Tis forty Summers since we first came together, and in all that Time, we
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
have seen nothing but smiling Days. 'Tis true, when we first fettled, the Indians came down upon us, and plundered us of all we had, and from the Fright, and one Thing or other, I had like to have died of a Fever; and once when he was at Sea, he was very near being swallowed up by a Shark; we were afterwards ship-wrecked, then sold for Slaves, after that we were confined in a close Dungeon, and every Body said, we should certainly be strangled. But no Matter for that; we had no bad Actions to tax ourselves with, and we were determined not to be frightened at any Thing.</P>

<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! My little Charge, I have charming News for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear; have you heard any Thing of my Father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have seen him myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I had seen him too—Pray where is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he's a very fortunate Man; what would many a one give for such a Situation—I would rather be as he is, than Overseer to a Cadi.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not he a Slave then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, he's a Slave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to such a Master—Why, do you know that he has the Honour to work in the Garden of the Seraglio of <HI>Abdallah,</HI> the Great Bashaw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dame <HI>Curtis</HI> has been telling me what a good Man the Bashaw is. But yet I wish my Fa∣ther was not a Slave to any body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that Bashaw will never give over doing good Things. What do you think I heard just now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Hali Hassan</HI> told me, that an <HI>En∣glish</HI> Lady was made a Slave yesterday, and the first Thing he did, upon her coming to the Sera∣glio, was to let her choose her own Apartments; nay, 'tis actually said, if she behaves well, she'll be suffered to have her own Servants to wait upon her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what of my Father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could not stay with him long, for I was ordered into the Bashaw's Presence: but I did not forget to tell him, that I had great Interest, and bid him hope for better Days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless you for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but when I told him so, he smiled, and said, he believed his good Days were over. However, I am going again by and by with some Fish, and then we shall see what's to be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are going again, will you take a Letter for me?—Oh dear, I am so happy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you seem pleas'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, indeed, pleas'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the Thoughts of writing to your Father, I suppose. Thou art a good Girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; 'tis to the Bashaw I shall write.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the Bashaw! Why, Child, do you know how to address such a great Man as him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know but little; yet I think, if I was to write, I should prevail on him to give my Father Liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'm sure I'll not be your Hindrance. But take Care what you are about. His Title be∣gins, Most high and most illustrious; and in the

<P>Now, my Lads, I'll undertake to bring the Prize into Port, in a few Glasses: mayhap we may meet with a smart Resistance; what then, must take Things as they are—Life's a Voyage, where we must expect all Weathers, sometimes rough, some∣times calm; and as for Despair, why it signifies nothing, Resolution and Skill are better than a stout Vessel; for why? Because they require no Carpenters, and get stronger, the more Labour they undergo.</P>
