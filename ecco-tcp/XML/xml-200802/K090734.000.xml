<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HOW highly the Writings of wise and good Men concerning Government have bin esteem'd in all Ages, the testimony of History, and the preservation of so many Books com∣pos'd by the Antients on that Subject, do sufficiently ma∣nifest. And it may be truly said, that unless men have utterly abandon'd themselves to all that is detestable, they have seldom attempted to detract from the worth of the Assertors of Liberty, tho Ambition and other passions have influenc'd them to act in opposition to it. When <HI>Augustus</HI> had surpriz'd a young <HI>Roman</HI> who was related to him, reading a political Discourse of <HI>Cicero,</HI> he commended his judgment in that choice. The History of <HI>France,</HI> written by the President <HI>de Thou,</HI> with a spirit of Freedom that might have bin worthy of those who liv'd before the violation of their Liberty, has bin so generally valu'd by men of all ranks in that Nation, that 'tis hard to find a Book on any important Subject which has had so many Editions. And the just esteem that the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth made of the Memoirs of <HI>Philip de Com∣mines</HI> (tho that Author has given so many instances of his detestation of Tyranny) may be enough to put this matter out of dispute. But if all other proof were wanting, the implacable hatred, and unweary'd industry of the worst of men to suppress such Writings, would abundantly testify their excellency.</P>
<P>That Nations should be well inform'd of their Rights, is of the most absolute necessity: because the happiness or infelicity of any People intirely depends upon the enjoyment or deprivation of Liberty; which is so invincibly prov'd in the following Discourses, that to endeavour to make i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more clear, would be an unpardonable presumption.</P>
<P>If any man think the publication of this Work to be unseasonable a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this time, he is desir'd to consider, that as men expect good Laws only from a good Government, so the Reign of a Prince, whose Title is founded upon the principle of Liberty which is here defended, cannot but be the most proper, if not the only time to inform the People of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that from a due sense of their inestimable value, they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> encourag'd to assert them against the attempts of ill men in time to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome.</P>
<P><PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
'Tis not necessary here to say anything concerning the Person of the Author. He was so well known in the world, so universally esteem'd by those who knew how to set a just value upon true Merit, and will appear so admirable in the following Discourses, as not to stand in need of a flattering Panegyrick. But it may not be amiss to say something of the Discourses now publish'd.</P>
<P>The Paper deliver'd to the Sheriffs immediately before his death in∣forms us, that he had left a Large and a Lesser Treatise written against the Principles contain'd in <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Book; and that a small part of the lesser Treatise had bin produc'd for evidence against him at his Trial. 'Tis there also said, that the lesser Treatise neither was, nor pro∣bably ever should have bin finish'd. This therefore is the Large Work mention'd in that Paper, and not the Lesser, upon part of which the wicked Sentence pronounc'd, and executed against him, was grounded.</P>
<P>It remains only to add a few words for satisfaction of the Publick, that these Discourses are genuine. And here I shall not need to say, that they were put into the hands of a Person of eminent Quality and Integrity by the Author himself; and that the Original is, in the judg∣ment of those who knew him best, all written by his own hand: His inimitable manner of treating this noble Subject, is instead of a thousand demonstrations, that the Work can belong to no other than the Great Man whose Name it bears.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING lately seen a Book intitul'd <HI>Patriarcha,</HI> written by Sir <HI>Robert Filmer,</HI> concerning the Universal and undistin∣guish'd Right of all Kings, I thought a time of leisure might be well employ'd in examining his Doctrin, and the Que∣stions arising from it; which seem so far to concern all Mankind, that, besides the Influence upon our future Life, they may be said to comprehend all that in this World deserves to be car'd for. If he say true, there is but one Government in the World that can have any thing of Justice in it: and those who have hitherto bin esteem'd the best and wisest of Men, for having constituted Commonwealths or Kingdoms; and taken much pains so to proportion the Powers of several Magistracys, that they might all concur in procuring the Publick Good; or so to divide the Powers between the Magistrats and People, that a well-regulated Harmony might be preserv'd in the whole, were the most unjust and foo∣lish of all Men. They were not builders, but overthrowers of Govern∣ments: their business was to set up Aristocratical, Democratical or mix'd Governments, in opposition to that Monarchy which by the immutable Laws of God and Nature is impos'd upon Mankind; or presumptuously to put Shackles upon the Monarch, who by the same Laws is to be abso∣lute and uncontrol'd: They were rebellious and disobedient Sons, who rose up against their Father; and not only refus'd to hearken to his Voice, but made him bend to their Will. In their Opinion, such only deserv'd to be call'd Good Men, who endeavour'd to be good to Mankind; or to that Country to which they were more particularly related: and in as much as that Good consists in a Felicity of Estate, and Perfection of Person, they highly valued such as had endeavour'd to make Men better, wiser and happier. This they understood to be the end for which Men enter'd into Societys: And tho <HI>Cicero</HI> says, that Commonwealths were instituted for the obtaining of Justice, he contradicts them not, but comprehends all in that
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
 word; because 'tis just that whosoever receives a Power, should employ it wholly for the accomplishment of the Ends for which it was given. This Work could be perform'd only by such as excell'd in Virtue; but lest they should deflect from it, no Government was thought to be well consti∣tuted, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Potentiora Legum quam hominum Im∣peria. <HI>Tacit.</HI></NOTE>unless the Laws prevail'd above the Commands of Men; and they were accounted as the worst of Beasts, who did not prefer such a Condi∣tion before a Subjection to the fluctuating and irregular Will of a Man.</P>
<P>If we believe Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> all this is mistaken. Nothing of this kind was ever left to the Choice of Men. They are not to inquire what conduces to their own good: God and Nature have put us into a way from which we are not to swerve: We are not to live to him, nor to our selves, but to the Master that he hath set over us. One Government is establish'd over all, and no Limits can be set to the Power of the Person that manages it. This is the Prerogative, or, as another Author of the same Stamp calls it, the <HI>Royal Charter</HI> granted to Kings by God. They all have an equal right to it; Women and Children are Patriarchs; and the next in Blood, with∣out any regard to Age, Sex, or other Qualitys of the Mind or Body, are Fathers of as many Nations as fall under their Power. We are not to examin, whether he or she be young or old, virtuous or vicious, sober minded or stark mad; the Right and Power is the same in all. Whether Virtue be exalted or supprest; whether he that bears the Sword be a Praise to those that do well, and a Terror to those that do evil; or a Praise to those that do evil, and a Terror to such as do well, it concerns us not; for the King must not lose his Right, nor have his Power diminish'd on any account. I have bin sometimes apt to wonder, how things of this nature could enter into the head of any Man: Or, if no Wickedness or Folly be so great, but some may fall into it, I could not well conceive why they should publish it to the World. But these thoughts ceas'd, when I consider'd that a People from all Ages in love with Liberty, and desirous to maintain their own Privileges, could never be brought to resign 'em, unless they were made to believe that in Conscience they ought to do it; which could not be, unless they were also persuaded to believe, that there was a Law set to all Mankind which none might trans∣gress, and which put the Examination of all those Matters out of their power. This is our Author's Work. By this it will appear whose Throne he seeks to advance, and whose Servant he is, whilst he pretends to serve the King. And that it may be evident he has made use of Means sutable to the Ends propos'd for the Service of his great Master, I hope to shew that he has not us'd one Argument that is not false, nor cited one Author whom he has not perverted and abus'd. Whilst my work is so to lay open these Snares that the most simple may not be taken in them, I shall not examin how Sir <HI>Robert</HI> came to think himself a Man fit to un∣dertake so great a Work, as to destroy the Principles, which from the be∣ginning seem to have bin common to all Mankind; but only weighing the Positions and Arguments that he alledges, will, if there be either truth or strength in them, confess the Discovery comes from him that gave us least reason to expect it; and that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Antients, there is not in the World a Piece of Wood out of which a <HI>Mercury</HI> may not be made.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. The common Notions of Liberty are not from School-Divines, but from Nature.</HEAD>
<P>IN the first Lines of his Book he seems to denounce War against Man∣kind, endeavouring to overthrow the Principle of Liberty in which God created us, and which includes the chief Advantages of the Life we enjoy, as well as the greatest helps towards the Felicity, that is the end of our hopes in the other. To this end he absurdly imputes to the School-Di∣vines that which was taken up by 'em as a common Notion, written in the Hearts of all Men, denied by none but such as are degenerated into Beasts, from whence they might prove such Points as of themselves were less evi∣dent. Thus did <HI>Euclid</HI> lay down certain Axioms, which none could deny that did not renounce common Sense, from whence he drew the Proofs of such Propositions as were less obvious to the Understanding; and they may with as much reason be accus'd of Paganism, who say that the Whole is greater than a Part, that two Halfs make the Whole, or that a streight Line is the shortest way from Point to Point, as to say, that they who in Politicks lay such Foundations as have bin taken up by Schoolmen and others as undeniable Truths, do therefore follow them, or have any regard to their Authority. Tho the Schoolmen were corrupt, they were neither stupid nor unlearned: They could not but see that which all Men saw, nor lay more approv'd Foundations, than, That Man is naturally free; That he cannot justly be depriv'd of that Liberty without cause, and that he dos not resign it, or any part of it, unless it be in consideration of a greater good, which he proposes to himself. But if he unjustly imputes the In∣vention of this to School-Divines, he in some measure repairs his Fault in saying, <HI>This has bin foster'd by all succeeding Papists for good Divinity: The Divines of the reformed Churches have entertain'd it, and the Common Peo∣ple every where tenderly embrace it.</HI> That is to say, all Christian Divines, whether reform'd or unreform'd, do approve it, and the People every where magnify it, as the height of human Felicity. But <HI>Filmer</HI> and such as are like to him, being neither reform'd nor unreform'd Christians, nor of the People, can have no Title to Christianity; and, in as much as they set themselves against that which is the height of human Felicity, they declare themselves Enemys to all that are concern'd in it, that is, to all Mankind.</P>
<P>But, says he, <HI>They do not remember that the desire of Liberty was the first cause of the Fall of Man:</HI> and I desire it may not be forgotten, that the Liberty asserted is not a Licentiousness of doing what is pleasing to every one against the Command of God; but an Exemption from all human Laws, to which they have not given their assent. If he would make us believe there was any thing of this in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, he ought to have prov'd, that the Law which he transgrest was impos'd upon him by Man, and consequently that there was a Man to impose it; for it will easily appear that neither the reform'd or unreform'd Divines, nor the People following them, do place the Felicity of Man in an exemption from the Laws of God, but in a most perfect conformity to them. Our Saviour taught us <HI>not to fear such as could kill the Body, but him that could kill and cast into</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
 <HI>Hell:</HI> And the Apostle tells us that <HI>we should obey God rather than Man.</HI> It has bin ever hereupon observ'd, that they who most precisely adhere to the Laws of God, are least sollicitous concerning the Commands of Men, unless they are well grounded; and those who most delight in the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, do not only subject themselves to him, but are most regular Observers of the just Ordinances of Man, made by the consent of such as are concern'd according to the Will of God.</P>
<P>The Error of not observing this may perhaps deserve to be pardon'd in a Man that had read no Books, as proceeding from Ignorance; if such as are grosly ignorant can be excus'd, when they take upon them to write of such Matters as require the highest knowledg: But in Sir <HI>Robert</HI> 'tis pre∣varication and fraud to impute to Schoolmen and Puritans that which in his first Page he acknowledg'd to be the Doctrin of all Reform'd and Un∣reform'd Christian Churches, and that he knows to have bin the Princi∣ple in which the <HI>Grecians, Italians, Spaniards, Gauls, Germans,</HI> and <HI>Bri∣tans,</HI> and all other generous Nations ever liv'd, before the Name of Christ was known in the World; insomuch that the base effeminate <HI>Asiaticks</HI> and <HI>Africans,</HI> for being careless of their Liberty, or unable to govern them∣selves, were by <HI>Aristotle</HI> and other wise Men call'd <HI>Slaves by Nature,</HI> and look'd upon as little different from Beasts.</P>
<P>This which hath its Root in common Sense, not being to be overthrown by Reason, he spares his pains of seeking any; but thinks it enough to render his Doctrin plausible to his own Party, by joining the Jesuits to <HI>Geneva,</HI> and coupling <HI>Buchanan</HI> to <HI>Doleman,</HI> as both maintaining the same Doctrin: tho he might as well have join'd the <HI>Puritans</HI> with the <HI>Turks,</HI> because they all think that one and one makes two. But whoever marks the Proceedings of <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Masters, as well as his Disciples, will ra∣ther believe that they have learn'd from <HI>Rome</HI> and the Jesuits to hate <HI>Gene∣va,</HI> than that <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> can agree in any thing farther than as they are oblig'd to submit to the Evidence of Truth; or that <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> can concur in any Design or Interest that is not common to Mankind.</P>
<P><HI>These Men allow'd to the People a liberty of deposing their Princes. This is a desperate Opinion.</HI> Bellarmin <HI>and</HI> Calvin <HI>look asquint at it.</HI> But why is this a desperate Opinion? If Disagreements happen between King and People, why is it a more desperate Opinion to think the King should be subject to the Censures of the People, than the People subject to the Will of the King? Did the People make the King, or the King make the Peo∣ple? Is the King for the People, or the People for the King? Did God create the <HI>Hebrews</HI> that <HI>Saul</HI> might reign over them? or did they, from an opinion of procuring their own Good, ask a King, that might judg them, and fight their Battels? If God's interposition, which shall be hereafter explain'd, dos alter the Case; did the <HI>Romans</HI> make <HI>Romulus, Numa, Tullus Hostilius,</HI> and <HI>Tarquinius Priscus</HI> Kings? or did they make or beget the <HI>Romans?</HI> If they were made Kings by the <HI>Romans,</HI> 'tis certain they that made them sought their own good in so doing; and if they were made by and for the City and People, I desire to know if it was not better, that when their Successors departed from the End of their Institution, by en∣deavouring to destroy it, or all that was good in it, they should be cen∣sur'd and ejected, than be permitted to ruin that People for whose good they were created? Was it more just that <HI>Caligula</HI> or <HI>Nero</HI> should be suf∣fer'd to destroy the poor Remains of the <HI>Roman</HI> Nobility and People, with the Nations subject to that Empire, than that the Race of such Monsters
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
should be extinguish'd, and a great part of Mankind, especially the best, against whom they were most fierce, preserv'd by their Death?</P>
<P>I presume our Author thought these Questions might be easily decided; and that no more was requir'd to shew the foremention'd Assertions were not at all desperate, than to examin the Grounds of them; but he seeks to divert us from this enquiry, by proposing the dreadful Consequences of subjecting Kings to the Censures of their People: whereas no Consequence can destroy any Truth; and the worst of this is, That if it were receiv'd, some Princes might be restrain'd from doing Evil, or punish'd if they will not be restrain'd. We are therefore only to consider whether the People, Senat, or any Magistracy made by and for the People, have, or can have such a Right; for if they have, whatsoever the Consequences may be, it must stand: And as the one tends to the Good of Mankind in restraining the Lusts of wicked Kings; the other exposes'em without Remedy to the Fury of the most savage of all Beasts. I am not asham'd in this to concur with <HI>Buchanan, Calvin,</HI> or <HI>Bellarmin;</HI> and without Envy leave to <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Associats the Glory of maintaining the contrary.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding our Author's aversion to Truth, he confesses, <HI>That</HI> Hayward, Blackwood, Barclay, <HI>and others who have bravely vindicated the Right of Kings in this Point, do with one consent admit, as an unquestiona∣ble Truth, and assent unto the natural Liberty and Equality of Mankind, not so much as once questioning or opposing it.</HI> And indeed I believe, that tho since the Sin of our first Parents the Earth has brought forth Briars and Brambles, and the Nature of Man has bin fruitful only in Vice and Wick∣edness; neither the Authors he mentions, nor any others, have had impu∣dence enough to deny such evident Truth as seems to be planted in the Hearts of all Men; or to publish Doctrins so contrary to common Sense, Virtue, and Humanity, till these Times. The production of <HI>Laud, Man∣waring, Sibthorp, Hobbs, Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin,</HI> seems to have bin reserv'd as an additional Curse to compleat the Shame and Misery of our Age and Country. Those who had Wit and Learning, with something of Inge∣nuity and Modesty, tho they believ'd that Nations might possibly make an ill use of their Power, and were very desirous to maintain the Cause of Kings, as far as they could put any good colour upon it; yet never denied that some had suffer'd justly (which could not be, is there were no Pow∣er of judging them) nor ever asserted any thing that might arm them with an irresistible Power of doing mischief, animate them to persist in the most flagitious Courses, with assurance of perpetual Impunity, or en∣gage Nations in an inevitable necessity of suffering all manner of Outra∣ges. They knew that the Actions of those Princes who were not altoge∣ther detestable, might be defended by particular Reasons drawn from them, or the Laws of their Country; and would neither undertake the defence of such as were abominable, nor bring Princes, to whom they wish'd well, into the odious extremity of justifying themselves by Argu∣ments that favour'd <HI>Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero,</HI> as well as themselves, and that must be taken for a Confession, that they were as bad as could be ima∣gin'd; since nothing could be said for them that might not as well be ap∣plied to the worst that had bin, or could be. But <HI>Filmer, Heylin,</HI> and their Associats, scorning to be restrain'd by such considerations, boldly lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree, and rightly enough affirm, <HI>That the whole Fabrick of that which they call Popular Sedition would fall to the ground, if the Principle of natural Liberty were remov'd.</HI> And on the other hand it must be acknowledg'd that the whole Fabrick of Tyranny will
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
 be much weaken'd, if we prove, That Nations have a right to make their own Laws, constitute their own Magistrats; and that such as are so constituted, owe an account of their Actions to those by whom, and for whom they are appointed.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Implicit Faith belongs to Fools, and Truth is comprehended by examin∣ing Principles.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST <HI>Filmer</HI>'s business is to overthrow Liberty and Truth, he, in his Passage, modestly professes <HI>not to meddle with Mysterys of State,</HI> or <HI>Arcana Imperii.</HI> He renounces those Inquirys thro an <HI>implicit Faith,</HI> which never enter'd into the head of any but Fools, and such as, thro a carelesness of the Point in question, acted as if they were so. This is the Foundation of the Papal Power, and it can stand no longer than those that compose the <HI>Roman</HI> Church can be persuaded to submit their Consciences to the Word of the Priests, and esteem themselves discharg'd from the necessity of searching the Scriptures, in order to know whether the things that are told them are true of false. This may shew whether our Author or those of <HI>Geneva</HI> do best agree with the <HI>Roman</HI> Doctrin. But his Instance is yet more sottish than his Profession: <HI>An Implicit Faith,</HI> says he, <HI>is given to the meanest Artificer.</HI> I wonder by whom! Who will wear a Shoo that hurts him, because the Shoo-maker tells him 'tis well made? or who will live in a House that yields no defence against the ex∣tremitys of Weather, because the Mason or Carpenter assures him 'tis a very good House? Such as have Reason, Understanding, or common Sense, will, and ought to make use of it in those things that concern themselves and their Posterity, and suspect the Words of such as are in∣terested in deceiving or persuading them not to see with their own Eyes, that they may be more easily deceiv'd. This Rule obliges us so far to search into Matters of State, as to examin the Original Principles of Government in general, and of our own in particular. We cannot distin∣guish Truth from Falshood, Right from Wrong, or know what Obedi∣ence we owe to the Magistrat, or what we may justly expect from him, unless we know what he is, why he is, and by whom he is made to be what he is. These perhaps may be call'd <HI>Mysterys of State,</HI> and some would persuade us they are to be esteem'd <HI>Arcana;</HI> but whosoever confesses him∣self to be ignorant of 'em, must acknowledg he is uncapable of giving any judgment upon things relating to the Superstructure, and in so doing evidently shews to others, that they ought not at all to hearken to what he says.</P>
<P>His Argument to prove this is more admirable. <HI>If an Implicit Faith,</HI> says he, <HI>is given to the meanest Artificer in his Craft, much more to a Prince in the profound Secrets of Government.</HI> But where is the Consequence? If I trust to the judgment of an Artificer, or one of a more ingenuous Pro∣fession, 'tis not because he is of it, but because I am persuaded he dos well understand it, and that he will be saithful to me in things relating to his Art. I do not send for <HI>Lower</HI> or <HI>Micklethwait</HI> when I am sick, nor ask the Advice of <HI>Maynard</HI> or <HI>Jones</HI> in a Suit of Law, because the first are Physicians, and the other Lawyers; but because I think them wise, learned,
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
diligent, and faithful, there being a multitude of others who go under the same name, whose Opinion I would never ask. Therefore if any Conclusion can be drawn from thence in favour of Princes, it must be of such as have all the Qualitys of Ability and Integrity, that should create this confidence in me; or it must be prov'd that all Princes, in as much as they are Princes, have such Qualitys. No general Conclusion can be drawn from the first Case, because it must depend upon the Circum∣stances, which ought to be particularly prov'd: And if the other be as∣serted, I desire to know whether <HI>Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Vitellius, Do∣mitian, Commodus, Heliogabalus,</HI> and others not unlike to them, had those admirable Endowments, upon which an Implicit Faith ought to have bin grounded; how they came by them; and whether we have any Promise from God, that all Princes should for ever excel in those Vertues, or whe∣ther by experience we find that they do so. If they are or have bin want∣ing in any, the whole falls to the ground; for no Man enjoys as a Prince that which is not common to all Princes: And if every Prince has not Wisdom to understand these profound Secrets, Integrity to direct him, ac∣cording to what he knows to be good, and a sufficient measure of Indu∣stry and Valour to protect me, he is not the Artificer to whom the Impli∣cit Faith is due. His Eyes are as subject to dazle as my own. But 'tis a shame to insist on such a Point as this. We see Princes of all sorts; they are born as other Men: The vilest Flatterer dares not deny that they are wise or foolish, good or bad, valiant or cowardly, like other Men: and the Crown dos neither bestow extraordinary Qualitys, ripen such as are found in Princes sooner than in the meanest, nor preserve them from the decays of Age, Sickness, or other Accidents, to which all Men are subject. And if the greatest King in the World falls into them, he is as uncapable of that mysterious Knowledg, and his Judgment is as little to be relied on, as that of the poorest Peasant.</P>
<P>This Matter is not mended by sending us to seek those Vertues in the Ministers, which are wanting in the Prince. The ill effects of <HI>Rehobo∣am</HI>'s Folly could not be corrected by the Wisdom of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Counsel∣lors: He rejected them; and such as are like to him will always do the same thing. <HI>Nero</HI> advis'd with none but Musicians, Players, Chariot∣drivers, or the abominable Ministers of his Pleasures and Crueltys. <HI>Ar∣cadius</HI> his Senat was chiefly compos'd of Buffoons and Cooks, influenc'd by an old rascally Eunuch. And 'tis an eternal Truth, that a weak or wicked Prince can never chuse a wise Council, nor receive any benefit by one that is impos'd upon him, unless they have a Power of acting with∣out him, which would render the Government in effect Aristocratical, and would probably displease our Author as much as if it were so in name also. Good and wise Counsellors do not grow up like Mushrooms; great Judgment is requir'd in chusing and preparing them. If a weak or vi∣cious Prince should be so happy to find them chosen to his hand, they would avail him nothing. There will ever be variety of Opinions a∣mongst 'em; and he that is of a perverted Judgment will always chuse the worse of those that are propos'd, and favour the worst Men, as most like to himself. Therefore if this Implicit Faith be grounded upon a sup∣position of profound Wisdom in the Prince, the Foundation is over∣thrown, and cannot stand; for to repose confidence in the Judgment and Integrity of one that has none, is the most brutish of all Follys. So that if a Prince may have or want the Qualitys, upon which my Faith in him can be rationally grounded, I cannot yield the Obedience he requires, un∣less
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
 I search into the Secrets relating to his Person and Commands, which he forbids. I cannot know how to obey, unless I know in what, and to whom: Nor in what, unless I know what ought to be commanded: Nor what ought to be commanded, unless I understand the Original Right of the Commander, which is the great <HI>Arcanum.</HI> Our Author finding himself involv'd in many Difficultys, proposes an Expedient as ridiculous as any thing that had gone before, being nothing more than an absurd begging the main question, and determining it without any shadow of proof. He enjoins an active or passive Obedience, before he shews what should ob∣lige or persuade us to it. This indeed were a compendious way of obvia∣ting that which he calls <HI>Popular Sedition,</HI> and of exposing all Nations, that fall under the Power of Tyrants, to be destroy'd utterly by them. <HI>Nero</HI> or <HI>Domitian</HI> would have desir'd no more, than that those who would not execute their wicked Commands, should patiently have suffer'd their Throats to be cut by such as were less scrupulous: And the World that had suffer'd those Monsters for some years, must have continu'd under their Fury, till all that was good and virtuous had bin abolish'd. But in those Ages and Parts of the World, where there has bin any thing of Vertue and Goodness, we may observe a third sort of Men, who would neither do Villanys, nor suffer more than the Laws did permit, or the consideration of the publick Peace did require. Whilst Tyrants with their Slaves, and the Instruments of their Crueltys, were accounted the Dregs of Mankind, and made the objects of detestation and scorn, these Men who deliver'd their Countrys from such Plagues were thought to have something of Divine in them, and have bin famous above all the rest of Mankind to this day. Of this sort were <HI>Pelopidas, Epaminondas, Thra∣sibulus, Harmodius, Aristogiton, Philopemen, Lucius Brutus, Publius Va∣lerius, Marcus Brutus, C. Cassius, M. Cato,</HI> with a multitude of others a∣mongst the antient Heathens. Such as were Instruments of the like De∣liverances amongst the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> as <HI>Moses, Othniel, Ehud, Barac, Gideon, Sampson, Jephtha, Samuel, David, Jehu,</HI> the <HI>Maccabees</HI> and others, have from the Scriptures a certain Testimony of the Righteousness of their Proceedings, when they neither would act what was evil, nor suffer more than was reasonable. But lest we should learn by their Examples, and the Praises given to them, our Author confines the Subject's choice to acting or suffering, that is, doing what is commanded, or lying down to have his Throat cut, or to see his Family and Country made desolate. This he calls giving to <HI>Cesar</HI> that which is <HI>Cesar</HI>'s; whereas he ought to have con∣sider'd that the Question is not, whether that which is <HI>Cesar</HI>'s should be render'd to him, for that is to be done to all Men; but who is <HI>Cesar,</HI> and what doth of right belong to him, which he no way indicates to us: so that the Question remains intire, as if he had never mention'd it, unless we do in a compendious way take his word for the whole.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. To depend upon the Will of a Man is Slavery.</HEAD>
<P>THis, as he thinks, is farther sweeten'd, by asserting, that he dos not inquire what the Rights of a People are, but from whence; not considering, that whilst he denies they can proceed from the Laws of natural Liberty, or any other Root than the Grace and Bounty of the Prince, he declares they can have none at all. For as Liberty solely con∣sists in an independency upon the Will of another, and by the name of Slave we understand a Man, who can neither dispose of his Person nor Goods, but enjoys all at the will of his Master; there is no such thing in nature as a Slave, if those Men or Nations are not Slaves, who have no other title to what they enjoy, than the grace of the Prince, which he may revoke whensoever he pleases. But there is more than ordinary Ex∣travagance in his Assertion, That <HI>the greatest Liberty in the World is for a People to live under a Monarch,</HI> when his whole Book is to prove, That this Monarch has his Right from God and Nature, is endow'd with an unlimited Power of doing what he pleases, and can be restrain'd by no Law. If it be Liberty to live under such a Government, I desire to know what is Slavery. It has bin hitherto believ'd in the World, that the <HI>Assy∣rians, Medes, Arabs, Egyptians, Turks,</HI> and others like them, liv'd in Slavery, because their Princes were Masters of their Lives and Goods: Whereas the <HI>Grecians, Italians, Gauls, Germans, Spaniards,</HI> and <HI>Cartha∣ginians,</HI> as long as they had any Strength, Vertue or Courage amongst 'em, were esteem'd free Nations, because they abhor'd such a Subjection. They were, and would be govern'd only by Laws of their own making: <HI>Potentiora erant Legum quam hominum Imperia.</HI> Even their <HI>Princes had the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit▪ Ibid.</NOTE><HI>Authority or Credit of Persuading, rather than the Power of Commanding.</HI> But all this was mistaken: These Men were Slaves, and the <HI>Asiaticks</HI> were Freemen. By the same rule the <HI>Venetians, Switzers, Grisons,</HI> and <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> are not free Nations: but Liberty in its perfection is enjoy'd in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Turky.</HI> The Intention of our Ancestors was, without doubt, to establish this amongst us by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and other preceding or sub∣sequent Laws; but they ought to have added one clause, That the Con∣tents of 'em should be in sorce only so long as it pleas'd the King. King <HI>Alfred,</HI> upon whose Laws <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was grounded, when he said the <HI>English</HI> Nation was as free as the internal thoughts of a Man, did only mean, that it should be so as long as it pleas'd their Master. This it seems
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
 was the end of our Law, and we who are born under it, and are descend∣ed from such as have so valiantly defended their Rights against the En∣croachments of Kings, have follow'd after vain shadows, and without the expence of Sweat, Treasure, or Blood, might have secur'd our beloved Liberty, by casting all into the King's hands.</P>
<P>We owe the discovery of these Secrets to our Author, who after having gravely declar'd 'em, thinks no offence ought to be taken at the freedom he assumes of examining things relating to the Liberty of Mankind, be∣cause he has the Right which is common to all. But he ought to have consider'd, that in asserting that Right to himself, he allows it to all Mankind. And as the temporal good of all Men consists in the preserva∣tion of it, he declares himself to be their mortal Enemy, who endeavours to destroy it. If he were alive, this would deserve to be answer'd with Stones rather than Words. He that oppugns the publick Liberty, over∣throws his own, and is guilty of the most brutish of all Follys, whilst he arrogates to himself that which he denies to all Men.</P>
<P>I cannot but commend his Modesty and Care <HI>not to detract from the Worth of Learned Men;</HI> but it seems they were all subject to error, except himself, who is render'd infallible thro Pride, Ignorance, and Impudence. But if <HI>Hooker</HI> and <HI>Aristotle</HI> were wrong in their Fundamentals concerning natural Liberty, how could they be in the right when they built upon it? Or if they did mistake, how can they deserve to be cited? or rather, why is such care taken to pervert their Sense? It seems our Author is by their Errors brought to the knowledg of the Truth. <HI>Men have heard of a Dwarf standing on the Shoulders of a Giant, who saw farther than the Giant; but now that the Dwarf standing on the Ground sees that which the Giant did overlook,</HI> we must learn from him. If there be Sense in this, the Giant must be blind, or have such eyes only as are of no use to him. He minded only the things that were far from him: These Great and Learned Men mistook the very Principle and Foundation of all their Doctrin. If we believe our Author, this misfortune befel them, because they too much trusted to the Schoolmen. He names <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and I presume intends to comprehend <HI>Plato, Plutarch, Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius,</HI> and all the antient <HI>Grecians, Italians,</HI> and others, who asserted the natural Free∣dom of Mankind, only in imitation of the Schoolmen, to advance the Power of the Pope; and would have compast their design, if <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Associats had not oppos'd 'em. These Men had taught us to make the <HI>unnatural Distinction between Royalist and Patriot;</HI> and kept us from seeing, <HI>That the relation between King and People is so great that their well-being is reciprocal.</HI> If this be true, how came <HI>Tarquin</HI> to think it good for him to continue King at <HI>Rome,</HI> when the People would turn him out? or the People to think it good for them to turn him out, when he desir'd to continue in? Why did the <HI>Syracusians</HI> destroy the Tyranny of <HI>Dionysius,</HI> which he was not willing to leave, till he was pull'd out by the heels? How could <HI>Nero</HI> think of burning <HI>Rome?</HI> Or why did <HI>Caligula</HI> wish the People had but one Neck, that he might strike it off at one blow, if their Welsare was thus reciprocal? 'Tis not enough to say, These were wicked or mad Men; for other Princes may be so also, and there may be the same reason of differing from them. For if the Proposition be not universally true, 'tis not to be receiv'd as true in relation to any, till it be particularly prov'd; and then 'tis not to be imputed to the Quality of Prince, but to the personal Vertue of the Man.</P>

I do not find any great matters in the passages taken out of <HI>Bellarmin,</HI> which, our Author says, comprehend the strength of all that ever he had heard, read, or seen produc'd for the natural Liberty of the Subject: but he not mentioning where they are to be found, I do not think my self oblig'd to examin all his Works, to see whether they are rightly cited or not; however there is certainly nothing new in them: We see the same, as to the substance, in those who wrote many Ages before him, as well as in many that have liv'd since his time, who neither minded him, nor what he had written. I dare not take upon me to give an account of his Works, having read few of them; but as he seems to have laid the Foundation of his Discourses in such common Notions as were assented to by all Mankind, those who follow the same method have no more regard to Jesuitism and Popery, tho he was a Jesuit and a Cardinal, than they who agree with <HI>Faber</HI> and other Jesuits in the Principles of Geome∣try, which no sober Man did ever deny.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. God leaves to Man the choice of Forms in Government; and those who constitute one Form, may abrogate it.</HEAD>
<P>BUT Sir <HI>Robert desires to make Observations on</HI> Bellarmin<HI>'s words, before he examins or refutes them;</HI> and indeed it were not possible to make such stuff of his Doctrin as he dos, if he had examin'd or did understand it. First, he very wittily concludes, <HI>That if by the Law of God, the Power be immediatly in the People, God is the Author of a Democracy:</HI> And why not as well as of a Tyranny? Is there any thing in it repugnant to the Being of God? Is there more reason to impute to God <HI>Caligula</HI>'s Monarchy, than the Democracy of <HI>Athens?</HI> Or is it more for the Glory of God, to assert his Presence with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Monarchs, than with the popular Governments of the <HI>Switsers</HI> and <HI>Grisons?</HI> Is Pride, Malice, Luxury and Violence so sutable to his Being, that they who exercise them are to be reputed his Ministers? And is Modesty, Humility, Equality, and Justice so contrary to his Nature, that they who live in them should be thought his Enemys? Is there any absurdity in saying, that since God in Goodness and Mercy to Mankind, has with an equal hand given to all the Benefit of Liberty, with some measure of understanding how to employ it, 'tis lawful for any Nation, as occasion shall require, to give the Exercise of that Power to one or more Men, under certain Limitations or Conditions; or to retain it in themselves, if they think it good for them? If this may be done, we are at the end of all Controversys concerning one Form of Government establish'd by God, to which all Mankind must submit; and we may safely conclude, that having given to all Men in some degree a Capacity of judging what is good for themselves, he has granted to all likewise a Liberty of inventing such Forms as please them best, without favouring one more than another.</P>
<P>His second Observation is grounded upon a Falsity in matter of Fact. <HI>Bellarmin</HI> dos not say, that Democracy is an Ordinance of God more than any other Government; nor that the People have no Power to make use of their Right; but that they do, that is to say ordinarily, transmit the Exercise of it to one or more. And 'tis certain they do sometimes,
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
 especially in small Citys, retain it in themselves: But whether that were observ'd or not by <HI>Bellarmin,</HI> makes nothing to our Cause, which we defend, and not him.</P>
<P>The next Point is subtile, and he thinks thereby to have brought <HI>Bel∣arrmin,</HI> and such as agree with his Principle, to a Nonplus. He doubts who shall judg of the lawful cause of changing the Govern∣ment, and says, It is <HI>a pestilent Conclusion to place that Power in the Multitude.</HI> But why should this be esteem'd pestilent? or to whom? If the allowance of such a Power to the Senat was pestilent to <HI>Ne∣ro,</HI> it was beneficial to Mankind; and the denial of it, which would have given to <HI>Nero</HI> an opportunity of continuing in his Villanys, would have bin pestilent to the best of Men, whom he endea∣vour'd to destroy, and to all others that receiv'd benefit from them. But this Question depends upon another; for if Governments are con∣stituted for the Pleasure, Greatness or Profit of one Man, he must not be interrupted; for the opposing of his Will, is to overthrow the Insti∣tution. On the other side, if the Good of the Governed be sought, care must be taken that the End be accomplish'd, tho it be with the prejudice of the Governor: If the Power be originally in the Multitude, and one or more Men, to whom the exercise of it, or a part of it was committed, had no more than their Brethren, till it was confer'd on him or them, it cannot be believ'd that rational Creatures would advance one or a few of their Equals above themselves, unless in consideration of their own Good; and then I find no inconvenience in leaving to them a right of judging, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cujus est in∣stituere, ejus est abrogate.</NOTE>whether this be duly perform'd or not. We say in general, <HI>He that insti∣tutes, may also abrogate,</HI> most especially when the Institution is not only by, but for himself. If the Multitude therefore do institute, the Multitude may abrogate; and they themselves, or those who succeed in the same Right, can only be fit Judges of the performance of the Ends of the Institu∣tion. Our Author may perhaps say, The publick Peace may be hereby disturb'd: but he ought to know, There can be no Peace, where there is no Justice; nor any Justice, if the Government instituted for the good of a Nation be turn'd to its ruin. But in plain English, the Inconveni∣ence with which such as he endeavour to afright us, is no more than that He or They, to whom the Power is given, may be restrain'd or chastis'd, if they betray their Trust; which I presume will displease none, but such as would rather subject <HI>Rome</HI> with the best part of the World depending on it, to the Will of <HI>Caligula</HI> or <HI>Nero,</HI> than <HI>Caligula</HI> or <HI>Nero</HI> to the Judg∣ment of the Senat and People; that is, rather to expose many great and brave Nations to be destroy'd by the rage of a savage Beast, than subject that Beast to the Judgment of all, or the choicest Men of them, who can have no interest to pervert them, or other reason to be severe to him, than to prevent the Mischiefs he would commit, and to save the People from ruin.</P>
<P>In the next place he recites an Argument of <HI>Bellarmin,</HI> That <HI>'tis evident in Scripture God has ordain'd Powers; but God has given them to no particu∣lar Person, because by Nature all Men are equal; therefore he has given Power to the People or Multitude.</HI> I leave him to untie that Knot if he can; but, as 'tis usual with Impostors, he goes about by Surmises to elude the Force of this Argument, pretending that in some other place he had contradict∣ed himself, and acknowledg'd that every Man was Prince of his Posteri∣ty; <HI>because that if many Men had bin created together, they ought all to have bin Princes of their Posterity.</HI> But 'tis not necessary to argue upon Passages
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
cited from Authors, when he that cites 'em may be justly suspected of Fraud, and neither indicates the Place nor Treatise, lest it should be de∣tected; most especially when we are no way concern'd in the Author's Credit. I take <HI>Bellarmin</HI>'s Argument to be strong; and if he in some place did contradict it, the hurt is only to himself: but in this particular I should not think he did it, tho I were sure our Author had faithfully repeated his words; for in allowing every Man to be Prince of his Posterity, he only says, every Man should be chief in his own Family, and have a Power over his Children, which no man denies: But he dos not understand La∣tin, who thinks the word <HI>Princeps</HI> doth in any degree signify an absolute Power, or a right of transmitting it to his Heirs and Successors, upon which the Doctrin of our Author wholly depends. On the contrary, The same Law that gave to my Father a Power over me, gives me the like over my Children; and if I had a thousand Brothers, each of them would have the same over their Children. <HI>Bellarmin</HI>'s Argument there∣fore being no way enervated by the alledg'd Passage, I may justly insist upon it, and add, That God has not only declar'd in Scripture, but written on the Heart of every Man, that as it is better to be cloth'd, than to go naked; to live in a House, than to lie in the Fields; to be defended by the united Force of a Multitude, than to place the hopes of his Security solely in his own strength; and to prefer the Benefits of Society, before a sa∣vage and barbarous Solitude: he has also taught them to frame such So∣cietys, and to establish such Laws as were necessary to preserve them. And we may as reasonably affirm, that Mankind is for ever oblig'd to use no other Clothes than leather Breeches, like <HI>Adam;</HI> to live in hollow Trees, and eat Acorns, or to seek after the Model of his House for a Ha∣bitation, and to use no Arms except such as were known to the Patriarchs; as to think all Nations for ever oblig'd to be govern'd as they govern'd their Familys. This I take to be the genuin sense of the Scripture, and the most respectful way of interpreting the Places relating to our purpose. 'Tis hard to imagin, that God who has left all things to our choice, that are not evil in themselves, should tie us up in this; and utterly incredible that he should impose upon us a necessity of following his Will, without declaring it to us. Instead of constituting a Government over his People, consisting of many Parts, which we take to be a Model fit to be imitated by others, he might have declar'd in a word, That the eldest Man of the eldest Line should be King; and that his Will ought to be their Law. This had bin more sutable to the Goodness and Mercy of God, than to leave us in a dark Labyrinth, full of Precipices; or rather, to make the Government given to his own People, a false Light to lead us to destructi∣on. This could not be avoided, if there were such a thing as our Author calls a <HI>Lord Paramount over his Childrens Children to all Generations.</HI> We see nothing in Scripture, of Precept or Example, that is not utterly ab∣horrent to this Chimera. The only sort of Kings mention'd there with approbation, is such a one <HI>as may not raise his Heart above his Brethren.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE> If God had constituted a Lord Paramount with an absolute Power, and mul∣titudes of Nations were to labour and fight for his Greatness and Pleasure, this were to raise his Heart to a height, that would make him forget he was a Man. Such as are vers'd in Scripture, not only know that it neither agrees with the Letter or Spirit of that Book; but that it is unrea∣sonable in it self, unless he were of a Species different from the rest of Mankind. His exaltation would not agree with God's Indulgence to his Creatures, tho he were the better for it; much less when probably he
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
 would be made more unhappy, and worse, by the Pride, Luxury and other Vices, that always attend the highest Fortunes. 'Tis no less incre∣dible that God, who disposes all things in Wisdom and Goodness, and ap∣points a due Place for all, should, without distinction, ordain such a Power, to every one succeeding in such a Line, as cannot be executed; the Wise would refuse, and Fools cannot take upon 'em the burden of it, without ruin to themselves, and such as are under them: or expose Man∣kind to a multitude of other Absurditys and Mischiefs; subjecting the Aged to be govern'd by Children; the Wise to depend on the Will of Fools; the Strong and Valiant, to expect defence from the Weak or Cowardly; and all in general to receive Justice from him, who neither knows nor cares for it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. <HI>Abraham</HI> and the Patriarchs were not Kings.</HEAD>
<P>IF any Man say, that we are not to seek into the depth of God's Coun∣sels; I answer, That if he had, for Reasons known only to himself, affix'd such a Right to any one Line, he would have set a Mark upon those who come of it, that Nations might know to whom they owe Sub∣jection; or given some testimony of his Presence with <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin,</HI> if he had sent them to reveal so great a Mystery. Till that be done, we may safely look upon them as the worst of Men, and teachers only of Lies and Follys. This persuades me little, to examin what would have bin, if God had it once created many Men, or the Conclusions that can be drawn from <HI>Adam</HI>'s having bin alone. For nothing can be more evident than that if many had bin created, they had bin all equal, unless God had given a Preference to one. All their Sons had inherited the same Right after their death; and no Dream was ever more empty, than his Whimsy of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Kingdom, or that of the ensuing Patriarchs. To say the truth, 'tis hard to speak seriously of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Kingdom, or to think any Man to be in earnest who mentions it. He was a Stranger, and a Pilgrim in the Land where he liv'd, and pretended to no Authority beyond his own Family, which consisted only of a Wife and Slaves. He liv'd with <HI>Lot</HI> as with his Equal, and would have no Contest with him, because they were Brethren. His Wife and Servants could neither make up, nor be any part of a Kingdom, in as much as the despotical Government, both in Practice and Principle, differs from the Regal. If his Kingdom was to be grounded on the Paternal Right, it vanish'd away of it self; he had no Child: <HI>Eliezer</HI> of <HI>Damascus,</HI> for want of a better, was to be his Heir: <HI>Lot,</HI> tho his Nephew, was excluded: He durst not own his own Wife: He had not one foot of Land, till he bought a Field for a burying-place: His three hundred and eighteen Men were Servants, (bought according to the custom of those days) or their Children; and the War he made with them, was like to <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Enterprize; which shews only that God can save by a few as well as by many, but makes nothing to our Author's purpose. For if they had bin as many in number as the Army of <HI>Semira∣mis,</HI> they could have no relation to the Regal, much less to the Paternal Power; for a Father dos not buy, but beget Children.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23"/>
Notwithstanding this, our Author bestows the proud Title of Lord Pa∣ramount upon him, and transmits it to <HI>Isaac,</HI> who was indeed a King like his Father, great, admirable, and glorious in Wisdom and Holiness, but utterly void of all worldly splendor or power. This spiritual Kingdom was inherited by <HI>Jacob,</HI> whose Title to it was not founded on Prerogative of Birth, but Election and peculiar Grace; but he never enjoy'd any other worldly Inheritance, than the Field and Cave which <HI>Abraham</HI> had bought for a burying-place, and the Goods he had gain'd in <HI>Laban</HI>'s Service.</P>
<P>The Example of <HI>Judah</HI> his Sentence upon <HI>Thamar</HI> is yet farther from the purpose, if it be possible; for he was then a Member of a privat Fa∣mily, the fourth Son of a Father then living; neither in possession, nor under the promise of the Privileges of Primogeniture, tho <HI>Ruben, Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> fell from it by their Sins. Whatsoever therefore the Right was, which belong'd to the Head of the Family, it must have bin in <HI>Jacob;</HI> but as he profest himself a keeper of Sheep, as his Fathers had bin, the exercise of that Employment was so far from Regal, that it deserves no explication. If that Act of <HI>Judah</HI> is to be imputed to a Royal Power, I have as much as I ask: He, tho living with his Father, and elder Bro∣thers, when he came to be of Age to have Children, had the same Power over such, as were of, or came into his Family, as his Father had over him; for none can go beyond the Power of Life and Death: The same in the utmost extent, cannot at the same time equally belong to many. If it be divided equally, it is no more than that Universal Liberty which God has given to Mankind; and every Man is a King till he devests him∣self of his Right, in consideration of something that he thinks better for him.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. <HI>Nimrod</HI> was the first King, during the Life of <HI>Chush, Cham, Shem,</HI> and <HI>Noah.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Creation is exactly describ'd in the Scripture; but we know so little of what past between the finishing of it and the Flood, that our Author may say what he pleases, and I may leave him to seek his Proofs where he can find them. In the mean time I utterly deny, that any Power did remain in the Heads of Familys after the Flood, that dos in the least degree resemble the Regal in Principle or Practice. If in this I am mistaken, such Power must have bin in <HI>Noah,</HI> and transmitted to one of his Sons. The Scripture says only, that he built an Altar, sacri∣fic'd to the Lord, was a Husbandman, planted a Vineyard, and per∣form'd such Offices as bear nothing of the Image of a King, for the space of three hundred and fifty Years. We have reason to believe, that his Sons after his Death continu'd in the same manner of Life, and the Equality properly belonging to Brethren. 'Tis not easy to determin, whether <HI>Shem</HI> or <HI>Japhet</HI> were the Elder; but <HI>Ham</HI> is declar'd to be the younger: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 9.</NOTE>and <HI>Noah</HI>'s Blessing to <HI>Shem</HI> seems to be purely Prophetical and Spiritual, of what should be accomplish'd in his Posterity; with which <HI>Japhet</HI> should be persuaded to join. If it had bin worldly, the whole Earth must have bin brought under him, and have for ever continu'd in his Race, which never was accomplish'd, otherwise than in the Spiritual Kingdom of
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
 Christ, which relates not to our Author's Lord Paramount.</P>
<P>As to earthly Kings, the first of 'em was <HI>Nimrod,</HI> the sixth Son of <HI>Chush</HI> the Son of <HI>Ham, Noah</HI>'s younger and accursed Son. This Kingdom was set up about a hundred and thirty Years after the Flood, whilst <HI>Chush, Ham, Shem</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> were yet living: whereas if there were any thing of Truth in our Author's Proposition, all Mankind must have continu'd under the Government of <HI>Noah</HI> whilst he liv'd; and that Power must have bin transmitted to <HI>Shem,</HI> who liv'd about three hundred and seventy Years after the erection of <HI>Nimrod</HI>'s Kingdom; and must have come to <HI>Japhet</HI> if he was the Elder, but could never come to <HI>Cham,</HI> who is de∣clar'd to have bin certainly the Younger, and condemn'd to be a Ser∣vant to them both; much less to the younger Son of his Son, whilst he, and those to whom he and his Posterity were to be Subjects, were still living.</P>
<P>This Rule therefore, which the Partizans of Absolute Monarchy fancy to be universal and perpetual, falling out in its first beginning, directly con∣trary to what they assert; and being never known to have bin recover'd, were enough to silence them, if they had any thing of modesty or regard to Truth. But the matter may be carried farther: For the Scripture not only testifys, that this Kingdom of <HI>Nimrod</HI> was an Usurpation, void of all Right, proceeding from the most violent and mischievous Vices, but exercis'd with the utmost fury, that the most wicked Man of the accursed Race, who set himself up against God, and all that is good, could be capable of. The progress of this Kingdom was sutable to its Institution: that which was begun in wickedness, was carried on with madness, and pro∣duc'd Confusion. The mighty Hunter, whom the best Interpreters call a <HI>cruel Tyrant,</HI> receding from the simplicity and innocence of the Patriarchs, who were Husbandmen or Shepherds, arrogating to himself a Domi∣nion over <HI>Shem,</HI> to whom he and his Fathers were to be Servants, did thereby so peculiarly become the Heir of God's Curse, that whatsoever has bin said to this day, of the Power that did most directly set it self against God and his People, has related literally to the <HI>Babel</HI> that he built, or figuratively to that which resembles it in Pride, Cruelty, Injustice and Madness.</P>
<P>But the shameless rage of some of these Writers is such, that they ra∣ther chuse to ascribe the beginning of their Idol to this odious Violence, than to own it from the consent of a willing People; as if they thought, that as all Action must be sutable to its Principle, so that which is unjust in its practice, ought to scorn to be deriv'd from that which is not detesta∣ble in its principle. 'Tis hardly worth our pains to examin whether the Nations, that went from <HI>Babel</HI> after the confusion of Languages, were more or less than seventy two, for they seem not to have gone according to Familys, but every one to have associated himself to those that un∣derstood his Speech; and the chief of the Fathers, as <HI>Noah</HI> and his Sons, were not there, or were subject to <HI>Nimrod;</HI> each of which Points doth destroy, even in the Root, all pretence to Paternal Government. Be∣sides, 'tis evident in Scripture, that <HI>Noah</HI> liv'd three hundred and fifty Years after the Flood; <HI>Shem</HI> five hundred; <HI>Abraham</HI> was born about two hundred and ninety Years after the Flood, and liv'd one hundred seventy five Years: He was therefore born under the Government of <HI>Noah,</HI> and died under that of <HI>Shem:</HI> He could not therefore exercise a regal Power whilst he liv'd, for that was in <HI>Shem:</HI> So that in leaving his Country, and setting up a Family for himself, that never acknowledg'd any Supe∣rior, and never pretending to reign over any other, he fully shew'd he
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
thought himself free, and to owe subjection to none: And being as far from arrogating to himself any Power upon the Title of Paternity, as from acknowledging it in any other, left every one to the same liberty.</P>
<P>The punctual enumeration of the Years that the Fathers of the holy Seed lived, gives us ground of making a more than probable conjecture, that they of the collateral Lines were, in number of days, not unequal to them; and if that be true, <HI>Ham</HI> and <HI>Chush</HI> were alive when <HI>Nimrod</HI> set himself up to be King. He must therefore have usurp'd this Power over his Father, Grandfather, and great Grandfather; or, which is more probable, he turn'd into Violence and Oppression the Power given him by a Multi∣tude; which, like a Flock without a Shepherd, not knowing whom to obey, set him up to be their Chief. I leave to our Author the liberty of chusing which of these two dos best sute with his Paternal Monarchy; but as far as I can understand, the first is directly against it, as well as against the Laws of God and Man; the other being from the consent of the Mul∣titude, cannot be extended farther than they would have it, nor turn'd to their prejudice, without the most abominable ingratitude and treache∣ry, from whence no Right can be deriv'd, nor any justifiable Example taken.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, if our Author resolve that <HI>Abraham</HI> was also a King, he must presume that <HI>Shem</HI> did emancipate him, before he went to seek his Fortune. This was not a Kingly posture; but I will not contradict him, if I may know over whom he reign'd. Paternal Monarchy is exercis'd by the Father of the Family over his Descendents, or such as had bin under the Dominion of him whose Heir he is. But <HI>Abraham</HI> had neither of these: Those of his nearest Kindred continu'd in <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> as ap∣pears by what is said of <HI>Bethuel</HI> and <HI>Laban.</HI> He had only <HI>Lot</HI> with him, over whom he pretended no right: He had no Children till he was a hundred Years old, (that is to say, he was a King without a Subject) and then he had but one. I have heard that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>Omnisque potestas im∣patiens con∣sortis erit.</P>
<P>Lucan.</P></NOTE> <HI>Sovereigns do impatiently bear Competitors;</HI> but now I find Subjection also doth admit of none. <HI>A∣braham</HI>'s Kingdom was too great when he had two Children; and to dis∣burden it, <HI>Ishmael</HI> must be expel'd soon aster the birth of <HI>Isaac.</HI> He ob∣serv'd the same method after the death of <HI>Sarah:</HI> He had Children by <HI>Keturah;</HI> but he gave them Gifts and sent 'em away, leaving <HI>Isaac</HI> like a Stoical King reigning in and over himself, without any other Subject till the birth of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Esau.</HI> But his Kingdom was not to be of a larger extent than that of his Father: The two Twins could not agree: <HI>Jacob</HI> was sent away by his Mother; he reign'd over <HI>Esau</HI> only, and 'tis not easy to determin who was the Heir of his worldly Kingdom; for tho <HI>Jacob</HI> had the birth-right, we do not find he had any other Goods than what he had gotten in <HI>Laban</HI>'s service. If our Author say true, the right of Primogeniture, with the Dominion perpetually annex'd by the Laws of God and Nature, must go to the eldest: <HI>Isaac</HI> therefore, tho he had not bin deceiv'd, could not have conser'd it upon the younger; for Man cannot overthrow what God and Nature have instituted. <HI>Jacob,</HI> in the Court-Language, had bin a double Rebel, in beguiling his Father, and supplanting his Brother: The blessing of being Lord over his Brethren, could not have taken place. Or if <HI>Isaac</HI> had Power, and his Act was good, the Prerogative of the Elder is not rooted in the Law of God or Nature, but is a matter of conveniency only, which may be chang'd at the Will of the Father, whether he know what he dos or not. But if this Paternal Right to Dominion were of any value, or Dominion over Men
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
 were a thing to be desir'd; why did <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> content themselves with such a narrow Territory, when after the death of their Ancestors, they ought, according to that rule, to have bin Lords of the World? All Authors conclude that <HI>Shem</HI> was the eldest by birth, or pre∣fer'd by the appointment of God, so as the Right must have bin in him, and from him transmitted to <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac:</HI> but if they were so pos∣sest with the contemplation of a Heavenly Kingdom, as not to care for the greatest on Earth; 'tis strange that <HI>Esau,</HI> whose modesty is not much commended, should so far forget his Interest, as neither to lay claim to the Empire of the World, nor dispute with his Brother the possession of the Field and Cave bought by <HI>Abraham,</HI> but rather to fight for a dwel∣ling on Mount <HI>Seir,</HI> that was neither possest by, nor promis'd to his Fa∣thers. If he was fallen from his Right, <HI>Jacob</HI> might have claim'd it; but God was his Inheritance, and being assur'd of his Blessing, he contented himself with what he could gain by his Industry, in a way that was not at all sutable to the Pomp and Majesty of a King. Which way soever therefore the business be turn'd, whether, according to <HI>Isaac</HI>'s Blessing, <HI>Esau</HI> should serve <HI>Jacob,</HI> or to our Author's opinion, <HI>Jacob</HI> must serve <HI>Esau,</HI> neither of the two was effected in their Persons: And the King∣dom of two being divided into two, each of them remain'd Lord of him∣self.</P>

If <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> were equally free; if <HI>Noah,</HI> as our Author affirms, divided <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> amongst his three Sons, tho he can't prove it; and if se∣venty two Nations under so many Heads or Kings went from <HI>Babylon</HI> to people the Earth, about a hundred and thirty years after the Flood, I know not why, according to the same rule and proportion, it may not be safely concluded, that in four thousand years Kings are so multiplied, as to be in number equal to the Men that are in the World; that is to say, they are, according to the Laws of God and Nature, all free, and inde∣pendent upon each other, as <HI>Shem, Ham,</HI> and <HI>Japhet</HI> were. And there∣fore, tho <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> had reign'd alone when there were no Men in the World except such as issu'd from them, that is no reason why any o∣ther should reign over those that he has not begotten. As the Right of <HI>Noah</HI> was divided amongst the Children he lest, and when he was dead, no one of them depended on the other, because no one of them was Fa∣ther of the other; and the Right of a Father can only belong to him that is so, the like must for ever attend every other Father in the World. This paternal Power must necessarily accrue to every Father: He is a King by the same Right as the Sons of <HI>Noah;</HI> and how numerous soever Familys may be upon the increase of Mankind, they are all free, till they agree
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
to recede from their own Right, and join together in, or under one Go∣vernment, according to such Laws as best please themselves.</P>

<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. X. Such as enter into Society, must in some degree diminish their Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>REASON leads them to this: No one Man or Family is able to provide that which is requisite for their convenience or security, whilst every one has an equal Right to every thing, and none acknow∣ledges a Superior to determin the Controversys, that upon such occasions must continually arise, and will probably be so many and great, that Man∣kind cannot bear them. Therefore tho I do not believe that <HI>Bellarmin</HI> said, a Commonwealth could not exercise its Power; for he could not be ignorant, that <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> did exercise theirs, and that all the Regular Kingdoms in the World are Commonwealths: yet there is no∣thing of absurdity in saying, That Man cannot continue in the perpetual and intire fruition of the Liberty that God has given him. The Liberty of one is thwarted by that of another; and whilst they are all equal, none will yield to any, otherwise than by a general consent. This is the ground of all just Governments; for Violence or Fraud can create no Right; and the same consent gives the Form to them all, how much soever they differ from each other. Some small numbers of Men, living within the Pre∣cincts of one City, have, as it were, cast into a common Stock, the Right which they had of governing themselves and Children; and by common Consent joining in one body, exercis'd such Power over every single Person as seem'd beneficial to the whole: and this Men call perfect <HI>Democracy.</HI> Others chose rather to be govern'd by a select number of such as most excell'd in Wisdom and Vertue; and this, according to the sig∣nification of the word, was call'd <HI>Aristocracy:</HI> Or when one Man excell'd all others, the Government was put into his hands under the name of <HI>Mo∣narchy.</HI> But the wisest, best, and far the greatest part of Mankind, re∣jecting these simple Species, did form Governments mix'd or compos'd of the three, as shall be prov'd hereafter, which commonly receiv'd their respective Denomination from the Part that prevail'd, and did deserve praise or blame, as they were well or ill proportion'd.</P>
<P>It were a solly hereupon to say, that the Liberty for which we contend, is of no use to us, since we cannot endure the Solitude, Barbarity, Weak∣ness, Want, Misery and Dangers that accompany it whilst we live alone, nor can enter into a Society without resigning it; for the choice of that So∣ciety, and the liberty of framing it according to our own Wills, for our own good, is all we seek. This remains to us whilst we sorm Govern∣ments, that we our selves are Judges how far 'tis good for us to recede srom our natural Liberty; which is of so great importance, that from thence only we can know whether we are Freemen or Slaves: and the difference between the best Government and the worst, dos wholly de∣pend upon a right or wrong exercise of that Power. If Men are naturally free, such as have Wisdom and Understanding will always frame good Governments: But if they are born under the necessity of a perpetual Slavery, no Wisdom can be of use to them; but all must for ever depend on the Will of their Lords, how cruel, mad, proud or wicked soever they be.</P>

<HEAD> SECT. XI. No Man comes to command many, unless by Consent or by Force.</HEAD>
<P>BUT because I cannot believe God has created Man in such a state of Misery and Slavery as I just now mention'd; by discovering the vanity of our Author's whimsical Patriarchical Kingdom, I am led to a certain conclusion, That every Father of a Family is free and exempt from the domination of any other, as the seventy two that went from <HI>Babel</HI> were. 'Tis hard to comprehend how one Man can come to be master of many, equal to himself in Right, unless it be by Consent or by Force. If by Consent, we are at an end of our Controversys: Governments, and the Magistrats that execute them, are created by Man. They who give a being to them, cannot but have a right of regulating, limiting and di∣recting them as best pleases themselves; and all our Author's Assertions concerning the absolute Power of one Man, fall to the ground: If by Force, we are to examin how it can be possible or justifiable. This sub∣duing by Force we call Conquest; but as he that forces must be stronger than those that are forc'd, to talk of one Man who in strength exceeds many millions of Men, is to go beyond the extravagance of Fables and Romances. This Wound is not cur'd by saying, that he first conquers one, and then more, and with their help others: for as to matter of fact, the first news we hear of <HI>Nimrod</HI> is, that he reign'd over a great multi∣tude, and built vast Citys; and we know of no Kingdom in the World, that did not begin with a greater number than any one Man could possibly subdue. If they who chuse one to be their Head, did under his conduct subdue others, they were Fellow-conquerors with him; and nothing can be more brutish, than to think, that by their Vertue and Valour they had purchas'd perpetual Slavery to themselves and their Posterity. But if it were possible, it could not be justifiable; and whilst our Dispute is con∣cerning Right, that which ought not to be is no more to be receiv'd, than if it could not be. No Right can come by conquest, unless there were a Right of making that Conquest, which, by reason of the Equality that our Author confesses to have bin amongst the Heads of Familys, and as I have prov'd goes into Infinity, can never be on the Aggressor's side. No Man can justly impose any thing upon those who owe him nothing. Our Author therefore, who <HI>ascribes the enlargement of</HI> Nimrod<HI>'s Kingdom to Ʋsurpation and Tyranny,</HI> might as well have acknowledg'd the same in the beginning, as he says all other Authors have done. However, he ought not to have imputed to Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> an Approbation of his Right, as Lord or King over his Family; sor he could never think him to be a Lord by the right of a Father, who by that rule must have liv'd and died a Slave to his Fathers that overliv'd him. Whosoever therefore like <HI>Nim∣rod</HI> grounds his pretensions of Right upon Usurpation and Tyranny, de∣clares himself to be, like <HI>Nimrod,</HI> a Usurper and a Tyrant, that is, an Enemy to God and Man, and to have no Right at all. That which was unjust in its beginning, can of it self never change its nature. <HI>Tempus in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> saith <HI>Grotius, nullam habet vim effectricem.</HI> He that persists in doing Injustice, aggravates it, and takes upon himself all the guilt of his Prede∣cessors. But if there be a King in the World, that claims a Right by Con∣quest,
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
and would justify it, he might do well to tell whom he conquer'd, when, with what assistance, and upon what reason he undertook the War: for he can ground no title upon the obscurity of an unsearchable antiquity; and if he dos it not, he ought to be look'd upon as a usurping <HI>Nimrod.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. XII. The pretended Paternal Right is divisible or indivisible: if divisible, 'tis extinguish'd; if indivisible, universal.</HEAD>
<P>THis paternal right to Regality, if there be any thing in it, is divisi∣ble or indivisible; if indivisible, as <HI>Adam</HI> has but one Heir, one Man is rightly Lord of the whole World, and neither <HI>Nimrod</HI> nor any of his Successors could ever have bin Kings, nor the seventy two that went from <HI>Babylon: Noah</HI> surviv'd him near two hundred years: <HI>Shem</HI> continu'd one hundred and fifty years longer. The Dominion must have bin in him, and by him transmitted to his Posterity for ever. Those that call themselves Kings in all other Nations, set themselves up against the Law of God and Nature: This is the Man we are to seek out, that we may yield obedience to him. I know not where to find him; but he must be of the race of <HI>Abraham. Shem</HI> was prefer'd before his Brethren: The Inheritance that could not be divided must come to him, and from him to <HI>Isaac,</HI> who was the first of his Descendents that outliv'd him. 'Tis pity that <HI>Jacob</HI> did not know this, and that the Lord of all the Earth, thro ignorance of his Title, should be forc'd to keep one of his Subjects Sheep for wages; and strange, that he who had wit enough to supplant his Bro∣ther, did so little understand his own bargain, as not to know that he had bought the perpetual Empire of the World. If in conscience he could not take such a price for a dish of Pottage, it must remain in <HI>Esau:</HI> How∣ever our Lord Paramount must come from <HI>Isaac.</HI> If the Deed of Sale made by <HI>Esau</HI> be good, we must seek him amongst the <HI>Jews;</HI> if he could not so easily devest himself of his Right, it must remain amongst his Descendents, who are <HI>Turks.</HI> We need not scruple the reception of either, since the late <HI>Scots</HI> Act tells us, <HI>That Kings derive their Royal Power from God alone; and no difference of Religion, &amp;c. can divert the right of Succession.</HI> But I know not what we shall do, if we cannot find this Man; for <HI>de non appa∣rentibus &amp; non existentibus eadem est ratio.</HI> The Right must fall if there be none to inherit: If we do not know who he is that has the Right, we do not know who is near to him: All Mankind must inherit the Right, to which every one has an equal title; and that which is Dominion, if in one, when 'tis equally divided among all Men, is that universal Liberty which I assert. Wherefore I leave it to the choice of such as have inhe∣rited our Author's opinions, to produce this <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Turk</HI> that ought to be Lord of the whole Earth, or to prove a better title in some other Person, and to persuade all the Princes and Nations of the World to submit: If this be not done, it must be confest this Paternal Right is a mere whim∣sical Fiction, and that no Man by birth has a Right above another, or can have any, unless by the concession of those who are concern'd.</P>
<P>If this Right to an universal Empire be divisible, and <HI>Noah</HI> did actually divide it among his three Sons: if seventy and two absolute Monarchs
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
 did at once arise out of the Multitude that had assembl'd at <HI>Babel; Noah,</HI> nor his Sons, nor any of the holy Seed, nor probably any elder than <HI>Nim∣rod</HI> having bin there; many other Monarchs must necessarily have arisen from them also. <HI>Abraham,</HI> as our Author says, was a King: <HI>Lot</HI> must have bin so also; for they were equals: his Sons <HI>Ammon</HI> and <HI>Moab</HI> had no dependence upon the Descendents of <HI>Abraham: Ismael</HI> and <HI>Esau</HI> set up for themselves, and great Nations came of them: <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Sons by <HI>Ke∣turah</HI> did so also; that is to say, every one as soon as he came to be of age to provide for himself, did so, without retaining any dependence upon the Stock from whence he came: Those of that Stock, or the Head of it, pretended to no Right over those who went from them. Nay, nearness in Blood was so little regarded, that tho <HI>Lot</HI> was <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Brother's Son, <HI>Eliezer</HI> his Servant had bin his Heir, if he had died childless. The like continu'd among <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Sons; no Jurisdiction was given to one above the rest: an equal division of Land was made amongst 'em: Their Judges and Magistrats were of several Tribes and Familys, without any other preference of one before another, than what did arise from the advantages God had given to any particular Person. This I take to be a proof of the utmost extent and certainty, that the Equality amongst Mankind was then perfect: He therefore that will deny it to be so now, ought to prove that neither the Prophets, Patriarchs, or any other Men did ever under∣stand or regard the Law deliver'd by God and Nature to Mankind; or that having bin common and free at the first, and so continu'd for many hundreds of years after the Flood, it was afterwards abolish'd, and a new one introduc'd. He that asserts this must prove it; but till it dos appear to us, when, where, how, and by whom this was done, we may safely believe there is no such thing; and that no Man is or can be a Lord amongst us, till we make him so; and that by nature we are all Brethren.</P>
<P>Our Author, by endeavouring farther to illustrate the Patriarchical Power, destroys it, and cannot deny to any Man the Right which he ac∣knowledges to have bin in <HI>Ismael</HI> and <HI>Esau.</HI> But if every Man has a Right of setting up for himself with his Family, or before he has any, he cannot but have a right of joining with others if he pleases; as his joining or not joining with others, and the choice of those others depends upon his own will, he cannot but have a right of judging upon what conditions 'tis good for him to enter into such a Society, as must necessarily hinder him from exercising the Right which he has originally in himself. But as it cannot be imagin'd that Men should generally put such Fetters upon themselves, unless it were in expectation of a greater good thereby to accrue to them, no more can be requir'd to prove that they do voluntarily enter into these Societys, institute them for their own good, and prescribe such Rules and Forms to them as best please themselves, without giving account to any. But if every Man be free, till he enter into such a Society as he chuses for his own good, and those Societys may regulate themselves as they think sit; no more can be requir'd to prove the natural Equality in which all Men are born, and continue, till they resign it as into a common stock, in such measure as they think fit for the constituting of Societys for their own good, which I assert, and our Author denies.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. There was no shadow of a Paternal Kingdom amongst the Hebrews, nor precept for it.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author is so modest to confess, that <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Kingdom, consist∣ing of seventy two Persons, was swallow'd up by the power of the greater Monarch <HI>Pharaoh:</HI> But if this was an Act of Tyranny, 'tis strange that the sacred and eternal Right, grounded upon the immutable Laws of God and Nature, should not be restor'd to God's chosen People, when he deliver'd them from that Tyranny. Why was not <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Mo∣narchy confer'd upon his right Heir? How came the People to neglect a Point of such importance? Or if they did forget it, why did not <HI>Moses</HI> put 'em in mind of it? Why did not <HI>Jacob</HI> declare to whom it did belong? Or if he is understood to have declar'd it, in saying the Scepter should not depart srom <HI>Judah,</HI> why was it not deliver'd into his hands, or into his Heirs? If he was hard to be found in a People of one kindred, but four degrees remov'd from <HI>Jacob</HI> their Head, who were exact in observing Ge∣nealogys; how can we hope to find him after so many thousand years, when we do not so much as know from whom we are deriv'd? Or rather how comes that Right, which is eternal and universal, to have bin nip'd in the bud, and so abolish'd before it could take any effect in the World, as never to have bin heard of amongst the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> nor the People of God, either before or after the Captivity, from the death of <HI>Jacob</HI> to this day? This I assert, and I give up the Cause if I do not prove it. To this end I begin with <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> the first Rulers of the People, who were nei∣ther of the eldest Tribe according to birth, nor the disposition of <HI>Jacob,</HI> if he did, or could give it to any; nor were they of the eldest Line of their own Tribe: and even between them the Superiority was given to <HI>Moses,</HI> who was the younger; as 'tis said, <HI>I have made thee a God to</HI> Pharaoh, <HI>and</HI> Aaron <HI>thy Brother shall be thy Prophet.</HI> If <HI>Moses</HI> was a King, as our Au∣thor says, but I deny, and shall hereafter prove, the matter is worse: He must have bin an Usurper of a most unjust Dominion over his Bre∣thren; and this Patriarchical power, which by the Law of God was to be perpetually fix'd in his Descendents, perish'd with him, and his Sons con∣tinu'd in an obscure rank amongst the Levites. <HI>Joshua</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Ephraim</HI> succeeded him; <HI>Othniel</HI> was of <HI>Judah, Ehud</HI> of <HI>Benjamin, Barak</HI> of <HI>Napthalim,</HI> and <HI>Gideon</HI> of <HI>Manasseh.</HI> The other Judges were of seve∣ral Tribes; and they being dead, their Children lay hid among the com∣mon People, and we hear no more of 'em. The first King was taken out of the least Family of the least and youngest Tribe. The second, whilst the Children of the first King were yet alive, was the youngest of eight Sons of an obscure Man in the Tribe of <HI>Judah: Solomon</HI> one of his youngest Sons succeeded him: Ten Tribes deserted <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> and by the command of God set up <HI>Joroboam</HI> to be their King. The Kingdom of <HI>Israel</HI> by the destruction of one Family pass'd into another: That of <HI>Ju∣dah</HI> by God's peculiar promise continu'd in <HI>David</HI>'s race till the Captivity; but we know not that the eldest Son was always prefer'd, and have no reason to presume it. <HI>David</HI> their most reverenced King left no precept sor it, and gave an example to the contrary: he did not set up the Eldest,
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
 but the Wisest. After the Captivity, they who had most wisdom or va∣lour to defend the People, were thought most fit to command; and the Kingdom at the last came to the <HI>Asmonean</HI> Race, whilst the Posterity of <HI>David</HI> was buried in the mass of the common People, and utterly depriv'd of all worldly Rule or Glory. If the Judges had not a Regal Power, or the Regal were only just, as instituted by God, and eternally annex'd to Paternity, all that they did was evil: There could be nothing of Justice in the Powers exercis'd by <HI>Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Samuel,</HI> and the rest of the Judges. If the Power was regal and just, it must have continu'd in the Descendents of the first: <HI>Saul, David,</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> could never have bin Kings: The Right failing in them, their Descendents could in∣herit none from them; and the others after the Captivity were guilty of the like injustice.</P>
<P>Now as the Rule is not general, to which there is any one just excep∣tion, there is not one of these Examples that would not overthrow our Author's Doctrin: If one deviation from it were lawful, another might be, and so to infinity. But the utmost degree of impudent madness to which perhaps any Man in the world has ever arriv'd, is to assert that to be universal and perpetual, which cannot be verify'd by any one Example to have bin in any place of the World, nor justify'd by any Precept.</P>
<P>If it be objected, That all these things were done by God's immediat disposition: I answer, that it were an impious madness to believe that God did perpetually send his Prophets to overthrow what he had ordain'd from the beginning, and as it were in spite to bring the minds of Men into inextricable confusion and darkness; and by particular Commands to over∣throw his universal and eternal Law. But to render this point more clear, I desire it may be consider'd, That we have but three ways of di∣stinguishing between good and evil.</P>
<P>1. When God by his Word reveals it to us.</P>
<P>2. When by his Deeds he declares it; because that which he dos is good, as that which he says is true.</P>
<P>3. By the Light of Reason, which is good, in as much as it is from God.</P>
<P>And first; It cannot be said we have an explicit word for that conti∣nuance of the Power in the eldest; for it appears not, and having none, we might conclude it to be lest to our liberty: For it agrees not with the goodness of God to leave us in a perpetual ignorance of his Will in a mat∣ter of so great importance, nor to have suffer'd his own People, or any other, to persist, without the least reproof or admonition, in a perpetual opposition to it, if it had displeas'd him.</P>
<P>To the 2<HI>d.</HI> The Dispensations of his Providence, which are the ema∣nations of his Will, have gone contrary to this pretended Law: There can therefore be no such thing; for God is constant to himself: his Works do not contradict his Word, and both of them do equally declare to us that which is good.</P>
<P>Thirdly; If there be any Precept that by the light of Nature we can in matters of this kind look upon as certain, 'tis that the Government of a People should be given to him that can best perform the Dutys of it: No Man has it sor himself, or from himsels; but for and from those who be∣fore he had it were his Equals, that he may do good to them. If there were a Man, who in Wisdom, Valour, Justice and Purity, surpass'd all others, he might be call'd a King by Nature, because he is best able to bear the weight of so great a charge; and like a good Shepherd to lead the People to good. <HI>Detur digniori</HI> is the voice of Reason and that we may
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
be sure <HI>Detur seniori</HI> is not so, <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>That a wise Child is better than an old and foolish King.</HI> But if this pretended Right do not belong to him that is truly the eldest, nothing can be more absurd than a fantastical pretence to a Right deduc'd from him that is not so. Now lest I should be thought to follow my own Inventions, and call them Reason, or the Light of God in us, I desire it may be observ'd that God himself has ever taken this method. When he rais'd up <HI>Moses</HI> to be the leader of his Peo∣ple, he endow'd him with the most admirable gifts of his Spirit that ever he bestow'd upon a Man: When he chose seventy Men to assist him, he endow'd them with the same spirit. <HI>Joshua</HI> had no other title to succeed him than the like evidence of God's Presence with him. When the Peo∣ple thro sin fell into misery, he did not seek out their Descendents, nor such as boasted in a prerogative of Birth; but shew'd whom he design'd for their Deliverer, by bestowing such gifts upon him as were requir'd for the performance of his work; and never fail'd of doing this, till that miserable sinful People rejecting God and his Government, desir'd that which was in use among their accursed Neighbours, that they might be as like to them in the most shameful Slavery to Man, as in the Worship of Idols set up against God.</P>
<P>But if this pretended Right be grounded upon no word or work of God, not the reason of Man, 'tis to be accounted a mere figment, that has no∣thing of truth in it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XIV. If the paternal Right had included Dominion, and was to be transfer'd to a single Heir, it must perish if he were not known; and could be applied to no other Person.</HEAD>
<P>HAving shew'd that the first Kings were not Fathers, nor the first Fathers Kings; that all the Kings of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> men∣tion'd in Scripture came in upon Titles different from, and inconsistent with that of Paternity; and that we are not led by the Word nor the Works of God, nor the Reason of Man, or Light of Nature, to believe there is any such thing; we may safely conclude there never was any such thing, or that it never had any effect, which to us is the same. 'Tis as ridiculous to think of retrieving that, which from the beginning of the World was lost, as to create that which never was. But I may go far∣ther, and affirm, that tho there had bin such a Right in the first Fathers of Mankind exercis'd by them, and for some ages individually transmitted to their eldest Sons, it must necessarily perish, since the Generations of Men are so confus'd, that no Man knows his own original, and conse∣quently this Heir is no where to be found; for 'tis a folly for a Man to pretend to an Inheritance, who cannot prove himself to be the right Heir. If this be not true, I desire to know from which of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Sons the Kings of <HI>England, France,</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI> do deduce their original; or what reason they can give why the title to Dominion, which is fancied to be in <HI>Noah,</HI> did rather belong to the first of their respective Races, that attain'd to the Crowns they now enjoy, than to the meanest Peasant of their Kingdoms; or how that can be transmitted to them, which was not in the first. We know that no Man can give what he has not; that if there be no giver,
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
 there is no gift; if there be no root, there can be no branch; and that the first point failing, all that should be deriv'd from it must necessarily fail.</P>
<P><HI>Our Author, who is good at resolving difficultys, shews us an easy way out of this strait.</HI> 'Tis true, <HI>says he,</HI> all Kings are not natural Parents of their Subjects; yet they either are, or are to be reputed the next Heirs to those first Progenitors, who were at first the natural Parents of the whole People, and in their right succeed to the exercise of the supreme Jurisdiction: and such Heirs are not only Lords of their own Children, but also of their Brethren, and all those that were subject to their Father, &amp;c. By this means it comes to pass, that many a Child succeeding a King, hath the right of a Father over many a grey-headed multitude, and hath the title of <HI>Pater Patriae.</HI></P>
<P>An Assertion comprehending so many Points, upon which the most important Rights of all Mankind do depend, might deserve some proof: But he being of opinion we ought to take it upon his credit, dos not vouch∣safe to give us so much as the shadow of any. Nevertheless being un∣willing either crudely to receive, or rashly to reject it, I shall take the li∣berty of examining the Proposition, and hope I may be pardon'd, if I dwell a little more than ordinarily upon that which is the foundation of his Work.</P>
<P>We are beholden to him for confessing modestly that all Kings are not the natural Fathers of their People, and sparing us the pains of proving, that the Kings of <HI>Persia,</HI> who reign'd from the <HI>Indies</HI> to the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> did not beget all the Men that liv'd in those Countrys; or that the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> who began to reign before they were five years old, were not the natural Fathers of the Nations under them. But if all Kings are not Fathers, none are, as they are Kings: If any one is, or ever was, the Rights of Paternity belong to him, and to no other who is not so also. This must be made evident; for matters of such importance require proof, and ought not to be taken upon supposition. If <HI>Filmer</HI> therefore will pre∣tend that the right of Father belongs to any one King, he must prove that he is the Father of his People; for otherwise it dos not appertain to him: he is not the Man we seek.</P>
<P>'Tis no less absurd to say he is to be reputed Heir to the first Progenitor: for it must be first prov'd, that the Nation did descend from one single Progenitor without mixture of other races: That this Progenitor was the Man, to whom <HI>Noah</HI> (according to <HI>Filmer</HI>'s whimsical division of <HI>Asia, Europe,</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> among his Sons) did give the Land now inhabited by that People: That this Division so made was not capable of Subdivisions; and that this Man is by a true and uninterrupted Succession descended from the first and eldest Line of that Progenitor: and all fails, if every one of these points be not made good. If there never was any such Man who had that Right, it cannot be inherited from him. If by the same rule that a parcel of the World was allotted to him, that parcel might be subdivided amongst his Children as they increas'd, the subdivisions may be infinite, and the right of Dominion thereby destroy'd. If several Na∣tions inhabit the same Land, they owe obedience to several Fathers: that which is due to their true Father, cannot be render'd to him that is not so; for he would by that means be depriv'd of the Right which is in∣separably annex'd to his Person: And lastly, whatsoever the Right of an Heir may be, it can belong only to him that is Heir.</P>
<P>Lest any should be seduc'd from these plain Truths by frivolous sug∣gestions, 'tis good to consider that the title of <HI>Pater Patriae,</HI> with which our Author would cheat us, has no relation to the matters of Right, upon
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
which we dispute. 'Tis a figurative speech, that may have bin rightly enough applied to some excellent Princes on account of their care and love to their People, resembling that of a Father to his Children; and can relate to none but those who had it. No man that had common sense, or valu'd truth, did ever call <HI>Phalaris, Dionysius, Nabis, Nero,</HI> or <HI>Caligula,</HI> Fathers of their Countrys; but Monsters, that to the utmost of their power endeavour'd their destruction: which is enough to prove, that sacred Name cannot be given to all, and in consequence to none but such, as by their Virtue, Piety, and good Government do deserve it.</P>
<P>These matters will yet appear more evident, if it be consider'd, that tho <HI>Noah</HI> had reign'd as a King; that <HI>Zoroaster,</HI> as some suppose, was <HI>Ham,</HI> who reign'd over his Children, and that thereby some Right might perhaps be deriv'd to such as succeeded them; yet this can have no influ∣ence upon such as have not the like Original: and no man is to be pre∣sum'd to have it, till it be prov'd, since we have prov'd that many had it not. If <HI>Nimrod</HI> set himself up against his Grandfather; and if <HI>Ninus,</HI> who was descended from him in the fifth Generation, slew him, they ill deserv'd the name and rights of Fathers; and none, but those who have renounc'd all Humanity, Virtue, and common Sense, can give it to them, or their Successors. If therefore <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>Shem</HI> had not so much as the shadow of Regal Power, and the actions of <HI>Nimrod, Ninus,</HI> and others who were Kings in their times, shew they did not reign in the right of Fathers, but were set up in a direct opposition to it, the titles of the first Kings were not from Paternity, nor consistent with it.</P>
<P>Our Author therefore, who should have prov'd every point, dos nei∣ther prove any one, nor assert that which is agreeable to divine or human Story, as to matter of fact; and as little conformable to common sense. It dos not only appear contrary to his general Proposition, That all Go∣vernments have not begun with the Paternal Power; but we do not find that any ever did. They who according to his rules should have bin Lords of the whole Earth, liv'd and died private men, whilst the most wicked and boisterous of their Children commanded the greatest part of the then inhabited World, not excepting even those Countrys where they spent and ended their days; and instead of entring upon the Government by the right of Fathers, or managing it as Fathers, they did by the most outrageous injustice usurp a violent Domination over their Brethren and Fathers.</P>
<P>It may easily be imagin'd what the Right is that could be thus acquir'd, and transmitted to their Successors. Nevertheless our Author says, <HI>All Kings either are, or ought to be reputed next Heirs,</HI> &amp;c. But why reputed, if they are not? How could any of the accursed race of <HI>Ham</HI> be reputed Father of <HI>Noah</HI> or <HI>Shem,</HI> to whom he was to be a Servant? How could <HI>Nimrod</HI> and <HI>Ninus</HI> be reputed Fathers of <HI>Ham,</HI> and of those whom they ought to have obey'd? Can Reason oblige me to believe that which I know to be false? Can a Lie, that is hateful to God and good Men, not only be excus'd, but enjoin'd, when (as he will perhaps say) it is for the King's Service? Can I serve two Masters, or, without the most unpar∣donable injustice, repute him to be my Father, who is not my Father; and pay the obedience due to him who did beget and educate me, to one from whom I never receiv'd any good? If this be so absurd, that no man dares affirm it in the person of any, 'tis as preposterous in relation to his Heirs: For <HI>Nimrod</HI> the first King could be Heir to no man as King, and could transmit to no man a Right which he had not. If it was ridiculous
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
 and abominable to say that he was Father of <HI>Chush, Ham, Shem</HI> and <HI>Noah;</HI> 'tis as ridiculous to say, he had the Right of Father, if he was not their Father; or that his Successors inherited it from him, if he never had it. If there be any way thro this, it must have accru'd to him by the extirpa∣tion of all his Elders, and their Races; so as he who will assert this pre∣tended Right to have bin in the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Kings, must assert, that <HI>Noah, Shem, Japhet, Ham, Chush,</HI> and all <HI>Nimrod</HI>'s elder Brothers, with all their Descendents, were utterly extirpated before he began to reign, and all Mankind to be descended from him.</P>
<P>This must be, if <HI>Nimrod,</HI> as the Scripture says, was the first that be∣came mighty in the Earth; unless men might be Kings, without having more Power than others: for <HI>Chush, Ham</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> were his Elders and Progenitors in the direct Line, and all the Sons of <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> and their Descendents in the Collaterals, were to be prefer'd before him; and he could have no Right at all that was not directly contrary to those Prin∣ciples which, our Author says, are grounded upon the eternal and indis∣pensable Laws of God and Nature. The like may be said of the seventy two Heads of Colonys, which (following, as I suppose, Sir <HI>Walter Ra∣leigh)</HI> he says went out to people the Earth, and whom he calls Kings: for according to the same Rule, <HI>Noah, Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> with their Descen∣dents, could not be of the number; so that neither <HI>Nimrod,</HI> nor the o∣thers that establish'd the Kingdoms of the World, and from whence he thinks all the rest to be deriv'd, could have any thing of Justice in them, unless it were from a Root altogether inconsistent with his Principles. They are therefore false, or the Establishments beforemention'd could have no Right. If they had none, they cannot be reputed to have any; for no man can think that to be true, which he knows to be false: having none, they could transmit none to their Heirs and Successors. And if we are to believe, that all the Kingdoms of the Earth are establish'd upon this Paternal Right; it must be prov'd that all those, who in birth ought to have bin prefer'd before <HI>Nimrod,</HI> and the seventy two, were extirpat∣ed; or that the first and true Heir of <HI>Noah</HI> did afterwards abolish all these unjust Usurpations; and making himself Master of the whole, left it to his Heirs, in whom it continues to this day. When this is done, I will acknowledg the Foundation to be well laid, and admit of all that can be rightly built upon it; but if this fails, all fails: The poison of the Root continues in the Branches. If the right Heir be not in possession, he is not the right who is in possession: If the true Heir be known, he ought to be restor'd to his Right: If he be not known, the Right must perish: For nothing can be said to belong to any man, if no man knows to whom it belongs, and can have no more effect than if it were not. This conclu∣sion will continue unmovable, tho the division into seventy two Kingdoms were allow'd; which cannot be without destroying the Paternal Power, or subjecting it to be subdivided into as many parcels as there are men, which destroys Regality; for the same thing may be requir'd in every one of the distinct Kingdoms, and others deriv'd from them. Or we must know who was that true Heir of <HI>Noah,</HI> that recover'd all: How, when, and to whom he gave the several Portions; and that every one of them do continue in the possession of those, who by this prerogative of Birth are rais'd above the rest of mankind: and if they are not, 'tis an impious folly to repute them so, to the prejudice of those that are; and if they do not appear, to the prejudice of all mankind; who being equal, are thereby made subject to them. For as Truth is the Rule of Justice;
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
there can be none, when he is reputed superior to all who is certainly in∣ferior to</P>
<P>[In this place two Pages are wanting in the Original Manuscript.]</P>
<P>—degenerated from that Reason which distinguishes men from beasts. Tho it may be fit to use some Ceremonys before a man be admitted to practise Physick, or set up a Trade, 'tis his own Skill that makes him a Doctor or an Artificer, and others do but declare it. An Ass will not leave his stupidity, tho he be cover'd with Scarlet; and he that is by na∣ture a Slave, will be so still, tho a Crown be put upon his Head: and 'tis hard to imagin a more violent inversion of the Laws of God and Nature, than to raise him to the Throne, whom Nature intended for the Chain; or to make them Slaves to Slaves, whom God has endow'd with the Virtues requir'd in Kings. Nothing can be more preposterous, than to impute to God the frantick Domination, which is often exercis'd by wicked, foolish and vile Persons, over the wise, valiant, just and good; or to subject the best to the rage of the worst. If there be any Family therefore in the world, that can by the Law of God and Nature, distinct from the Ordinance of Man, pretend to an hereditary Right of Domi∣nion over any People, it must be one that never did, and never can pro∣duce any Person that is not free from all the Infirmitys and Vices that ren∣der him unable to exercise the Sovereign Power; and is endow'd with all the Virtues requir'd to that end; or at least a Promise from God, verify'd by Experience, that the next in Blood shall ever be able and fit for that work. But since we do not know that any such has yet appear'd in the World, we have no reason to believe that there is, or ever was any such; and consequently none upon whom God has confer'd the Rights that can∣not be exercis'd without them.</P>
<P>If there was no shadow of a Paternal Right in the Institution of the Kingdoms of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> there could be none in those that succeeded. <HI>Rehoboam</HI> could have no other than from <HI>Solomon:</HI> When he reign'd over two Tribes, and <HI>Jeroboam</HI> over ten, 'tis not possible that both of 'em could be the next Heir of their last common Father <HI>Jacob;</HI> and 'tis absurd to say, that ought to be reputed which is impossible: for our thoughts are ever to be guided by Truth, or such an appearance of it, as dos per∣suade or convince us.</P>
<P>The same Title of Father is yet more ridiculously or odiously apply'd to the succeeding Kings. <HI>Baasha</HI> had no other Title to the Crown, than by killing <HI>Nadab</HI> the Son of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> and destroying his Family. <HI>Zimri</HI> purchas'd the same honour by the slaughter of <HI>Elah</HI> when he was drunk, and dealing with the House of <HI>Baasha,</HI> as he had done with that of <HI>Jero∣boam. Zimri</HI> burning himself, transfer'd the same to <HI>Omri,</HI> as a reward for bringing him to that extremity. As <HI>Jehu</HI> was more fierce than these, he seems to have gain'd a more excellent recompence than any since <HI>Jero∣boam,</HI> even a conditional Promise of a perpetual Kingdom; but falling from these glorious Privileges, purchas'd by his Zeal in killing two wick∣ed Kings, and above one hundred of their Brethren, <HI>Shallum</HI> must have inherited them, by destroying <HI>Zachary</HI> and all that remain'd of his Race. This in plain English is no less than to say, that whosoever kills a King, and invades a Crown, tho the act and means of accomplishing it be never so detestable, dos thereby become Father of his Country, and Heir of all the Divine Privileges annex'd to that glorious Inheritance. And tho
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
 I cannot tell whether such a Doctrin be more sottish, monstrous or im∣pious, I dare affirm, that if it were receiv'd, no King in the World could think himself safe in his Throne for one day: They are already encom∣past with many dangers; but lest Pride, Avarice, Ambition, Lust, Rage, and all the Vices that usually reign in the hearts of worldly men, should not be sufficient to invite 'em perpetually to disturb Mankind, thro the desire of gaining the Power, Riches and Splendor that accompa∣ny a Crown, our Author proposes to 'em the most sacred Privileges, as a reward of the most execrable Crimes. He that was stir'd up only by the violence of his own Nature, thought that a Kingdom could never be bought at too dear a rate;

But if the sacred Character of God's Anointed or Vicegerent, and Father of a Country, were added to the other Advantages that follow the high∣est Fortunes; the most modest and just men would be fill'd with fury, that they might attain to them. Nay, it may be, even the best would be the most forward in conspiring against such as reign: they who could not be tempted with external Pleasures, would be most in love with divine Privileges; and since they should become the sacred Ministers of God, if they succeeded, and Traitors or Rogues only if they miscarried, their only care would be so to lay their Designs, that they might be surely executed. This is a Doctrin worthy of <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Invention, and <HI>Heylin</HI>'s Approbation; which being well weigh'd, will shew to all good and just Kings how far they are oblig'd to those, who under pretence of advancing their Authority, fill the minds of men with such Notions as are so desperatly pernicious to them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVI. The Antients chose those to be Kings, who excell'd in the Virtues that are most beneficial to Civil Societys.</HEAD>
<P>IF the <HI>Israelites,</HI> whose Lawgiver was God, had no King in the first Institution of their Government, 'tis no wonder that other Nations should not think themselves oblig'd to set up any: if they who came all of one stock, and knew their Genealogys, when they did institute Kings, had no regard to our Author's Chimerical right of Inheritance, nor were taught by God or his Prophets to have any; 'tis not strange that Nations, who did not know their own Original, and who probably, if not cer∣tainly, came of several Stocks, never put themselves to the trouble of seek∣ing one, who by his birth deserv'd to be prefer'd before others: and va∣rious Changes happening in all Kingdoms (whereby in process of time the Crowns were transported into divers Familys, to which the Right of Inheritance could not without the utmost impiety and madness be im∣puted) such a fancy certainly could only enter into the heads of Fools; and we know of none so foolish to have harbour'd it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grecians,</HI> amongst others who follow'd the Light of Reason, knew no other original Title to the Government of a Nation, than that Wis∣dom,
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
Valour and Justice, which was beneficial to the People. These Qualitys gave beginning to those Governments, which we call <HI>Heroum Regna;</HI> and the Veneration paid to such as enjoy'd them, proceeded from a grateful sense of the Good receiv'd from them: They were thought to be descended from the Gods, who in Vertue and Beneficence surpass'd other men: The same attended their Descendents, till they came to abuse their Power, and by their Vices shew'd themselves like to, or worse than others. Those Nations did not seek the most antient, but the most worthy; and thought such only worthy to be prefer'd before others, who could best perform their Duty. The <HI>Spartans</HI> knew that <HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> were not their Fathers, for they were a Nation before either of them were born; but thinking their Children might be like to them in Valour, they brought them from <HI>Thebes</HI> and <HI>Epirus</HI> to be their Kings. If our Author is of another opinion, I desire to know, whether the <HI>Hera∣clidae,</HI> or the <HI>Aeacidae</HI> were, or ought to be reputed Fathers of the <HI>Lacede∣monians;</HI> for if the one was, the other was not.</P>
<P>The same method was follow'd in <HI>Italy;</HI> and they who esteem'd them∣selves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Qui rupto robore nati</L>

Sat. 6.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE> <HI>Aborigines,</HI> could not set up one to govern them under the Title of <HI>Parent.</HI> They could pay no veneration to any Man under the name of a common Father, who thought they had none; and they who esteem'd themselves equal, could have no reason to prefer any one, unless he were distinguish'd from others by the Vertues that were beneficial to all. This may be illustrated by matters of fact. <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus,</HI> the Sons of a Nun, constuprated, as is probable, by a lusty Soldier, who was said to be <HI>Mars,</HI> for their Vigour and Valour were made heads of a gather'd People. We know not that ever they had any Children; but we are sure they could not be Fathers of the People that flock'd to them from several places, nor in any manner be reputed Heirs of him or them that were so: for they never knew who was their own Father; and when their Mother came to be discover'd, they ought to have bin Subjects to <HI>Amulius</HI> or <HI>Numitor.</HI> They could not be his Heirs whilst he liv'd, and were not when he died: The Government of the <HI>Latins</HI> continu'd at <HI>Alba,</HI> and <HI>Romulus</HI> reign'd over those who join'd with him in building <HI>Rome.</HI> The Power not coming to him by Inheritance, must have bin gain'd by Force, or confer'd upon him by Consent: It could not be acquir'd by Force; for one Man could not force a multitude of fierce and valiant men, as they appear to have bin. It must therefore have bin by Consent: And when he aim'd at more Authority than they were willing to allow, they slew him. He being dead, they fetch'd <HI>Numa</HI> from among the <HI>Sabines:</HI> He was not their Father, nor Heir to their Father, but a Stranger; not a Conqueror, but an unarm'd Philosopher. <HI>Tullus Hostilius</HI> had no other Title: <HI>Ancus Martius</HI> was no way related to such as had reign'd. The first <HI>Tarquin</HI> was the Son of a banish'd <HI>Corinthian. Servius Tullus</HI> came to <HI>Rome</HI> in the belly of his captive Mother, and could inherit nothing but Chains from his vanquish'd Father. <HI>Tarquin</HI> the Proud murder'd him, and first took upon himself the Title of King, <HI>sine jussu Populi.</HI> If this <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv.</NOTE>Murder and Usurpation be call'd a Conquest, and thought to create a Right, the effect will be but small: The Conqueror was soon conquer'd, banish'd, and his Sons slain, after which we hear no more of him or his Descendents. Whatsoever he gain'd from <HI>Servius,</HI> or the People, was
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
 soon lost, and did accrue to those that conquer'd and ejected him; and they might retain what was their own, or confer it upon one or more, in such manner and measure as best pleas'd themselves. If the Regal Power, which our Author says was in the Consuls, could be divided into two parts, limited to a Year, and suffer such restrictions as the People pleas'd to lay upon it, they might have divided it into as many parcels, and put it in∣to such form, as best suted with their Inclinations; and the several Ma∣gistracys which they did create for the exercise of the Kingly, and all other Powers, shews they were to give account to none but themselves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Israelites, Spartans, Romans</HI> and others, who thus fram'd their Governments according to their own Will, did it not by any peculiar Pri∣viledg, but by a universal Right confer'd upon them by God and Nature: They were made of no better Clay than others: They had no Right, that dos not as well belong to other Nations; that is to say, The Consti∣tion of every Government is refer'd to those who are concern'd in it, and no other has any thing to do with it.</P>
<P>Yet if it be asserted, that the Goverment of <HI>Rome</HI> was Paternal, or they had none at all; I desire to know, how they came to have six Fathers of several Familys, whilst they liv'd under Kings; and two or more new ones every Year afterwards: Or how they came to be so excellent in Vertue and Fortune, as to conquer the best part of the World, if they had no Government. <HI>Hobbs</HI> indeed dos scurrilously deride <HI>Cicero, Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari∣stotle, Caeteros{que} Romanae &amp; Graecae Anarchiae fautores.</HI> But 'tis strange that this Anarchy, which he resembles to a Chaos, full of darkness and confusion, that can have no Strength or regular Action, should overthrow all the Monarchys that came within their reach, <HI>If</HI> (as our Authors says) <HI>the best order, greatest strength, and most stability be in them.</HI> It must therefore be confest, that these Governments are, in their various Forms, rightly instituted by several Nations, without any regard to Inhe∣ritance; or that these Nations have had no Governments, and were more strong, vertuous and happy without Government, than under it, which is most absurd.</P>
<P>But if Governments arise from the Consent of Men, and are instituted by Men according to their own Inclinations, they do therein seek their own Good; for the Will is ever drawn by some real Good, or the appearance of it. This is that which man seeks by all the regular or irregular mo∣tions of his mind: Reason and Passion, Vertue and Vice do herein con∣cur, tho they differ vastly in the Objects, in which each of 'em thinks this Good to consist. A People therefore that sets up Kings, Dictators, Consuls, Pretors or Emperors, dos it not, that they may be great, glo∣rious, rich or happy, but that it may be well with themselves and their Posterity. This is not accomplish'd simply by setting one, a few, or more men in the administration of Powers, but by placing the Authority in those who may rightly perform their Office. This is not every man's Work: Valour, Integrity, Wisdom, Industry, Experience and Skill, are requir'd for the management of those Military and Civil Affairs that necessarily fall under the care of the chief Magistrats. He or they there∣fore may reasonably be advanc'd above their Equals, who are most fit to perform the Dutys belonging to their Stations, in order to the publick Good, for which they were instituted.</P>
<P><HI>Marius, Sylla, Catiline, Julius</HI> or <HI>Octavius Caesar,</HI> and all those who by force or fraud usurp'd a Dominion over their Brethren, could have no Title to this Right; much less could they become Fathers of the People,
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
by using all the most wicked means that could well be imagin'd to destroy them; and not being regularly chosen for their Vertues, or the opinion of them, nor prefer'd on account of any Prerogative that had bin from the beginning annex'd to their Familys, they could have no other Right than Occupation could confer upon them. If this can confer a Right, there is an end of all Disputes concerning the Laws of God or Man. If <HI>Julius</HI> and <HI>Octavius Caesar</HI> did successively become Lords and Fathers of their Country, by slaughtering almost all the Senat, and such Persons as were eminent for Nobility or Vertue, together with the greater part of the People, it cannot be denied, that a Thief, who breaks into his Neighbour's House, and kills him, is justly Master of his Estate; and may exact the same obedience from his Children, that they render'd to their Father. If this Right could be transfer'd to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> either thro the malice of <HI>Octavius,</HI> or the fraud of his Wife; a wet Blanket laid over his face, and a few corrupted Soldiers could invest <HI>Caligula</HI> with the same. A vile Rascal pulling <HI>Claudius</HI> out by the heels from behind the Hangings where he had hid himself, could give it to him. A dish of Mushrooms well season'd by the infamous Strumpet his Wife, and a Potion prepar'd for <HI>Britannicus</HI> by <HI>Locusta,</HI> could transfer it to her Son, who was a stran∣ger to his Blood. <HI>Galba</HI> became Heir to it, by driving <HI>Nero</HI> to despair and death. Two common Soldiers by exciting his Guards to kill him, could give a just Tittle to the Empire of the World to <HI>Otho,</HI> who was thought to be the worst man in it. If a Company of Villains in the <HI>German</HI> Ar∣my, thinking it as fit for them as others to create a Father of Mankind, could conser the Dignity upon <HI>Vitellius;</HI> and if <HI>Vespasian,</HI> causing him to be kill'd, and thrown into a Jakes less impure than his Life, did inherit all the glorious and sacred Privileges belonging to that Title, 'tis in vain to inquire after any man's right to any thing.</P>
<P>But if there be such a thing as Right or Wrong to be examin'd by men, and any Rules set, whereby the one may be distinguish'd from the other; these Extravagancys can have no effect of Right. Such as commit 'em, are not to be look'd upon as Fathers, but as the most mortal Enemys of their respective Countrys. No Right is to be acknowledg'd in any, but such as is confer'd upon them by those who have the right of conferring, and are concern'd in the exercise of the Power, upon such conditions as best please themselves. No Obedience can be due to him or them, who have not a right of commanding; which cannot reasonably be confer'd upon any, that are not esteem'd willing and able rightly to execute it. This ability to perform the highest Works that come within the reach of Men; and integrity of Will not to be diverted from it by any temptati∣on, or consideration of privat Advantages, comprehending all that is most commendable in Man; we may easily see, that whensoever men act according to the Law of their own Nature, which is Reason, they can have no other rule to direct them in advancing one above another, than the opinion of a man's Vertue and Ability, best to perform the Duty in∣cumbent upon him; that is, by all means to procure the good of the Peo∣ple committed to his charge. He is only fit to conduct a Ship, who un∣derstands the Art of a Pilot: When we are sick, we seek the assistance of such as are best skill'd in Physick: The Command of an Army is prudently confer'd upon him that has most Industry, Skill, Experi∣ence and Valour: In like manner, He only can, according to the rules of Nature, be advanc'd to the Dignitys of the World, who excels in the Vertues requir'd for the performance of the Dutys annex'd to them;
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
 for he only can answer the end of his Institution, The Law of every i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stituted Power, is to accomplish the end of its Institution, as Creature are to do the Will of their Creator, and in deflecting from it, overthro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their own being.

<HEAD>SECT. XVII. God having given the Government of the World to no one Man, nor de∣clar'd how it should be divided, left it to the VVill of Man.</HEAD>
<P><HI>OUR Author's next Inquiry is,</HI> What becomes of the Right of Father∣hood, in case the Crown should escheat for want of an Heir? Whether it doth not escheat to the People? <HI>His answer is,</HI> 'Tis but the negligence or ignorance of the People, to lose the knowledg of the true Heir, &amp;c. <HI>And a little below,</HI> The Power is not devolv'd to the Multitude: No; the Kingly Power escheats on independent Heads of Familys: All such prime Heads have Power to consent in the uniting, or conferring their Fatherly Right of Sove∣reign Authority on whom they please; and he that is so elected, claims not his Power as a Donative from the People, but as being substituted by God, from whom he receives his Royal Charter of Universal Father, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In my opinion, before he had ask'd, What should be done in case the Crown should escheat for want of an Heir? he ought to have prov'd, there had bin a Man in the world, who had the Right in himself, and telling who he was, have shew'd how it had bin transmitted for some Generations, that we might know where to seek his Heir: and before he accus'd the Multitude of ignorance or negligence, in not knowing this Heir, he ought to have inform'd us, how it may be possible to know him, or what it would avail us if we did know him; for 'tis in vain to know to whom a Right belongs, that never was, and never can be executed. But we may go farther, and affirm, that as the Universal Right must have bin in <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>Shem</HI> (if in any) who never exercis'd it; we have reason to believe there never was any such thing: And having prov'd from Scripture and Human History, That the first Kingdoms were set up in a direct opposition to this Right, by <HI>Nimrod</HI> and others, he that should seek and find their Heirs, would only find those, who by a most accursed Wickedness, had usurp'd and continu'd a Dominion over their Fathers,
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
 contrary to the Laws of God and Nature; and we should neither be more wise, nor more happy than we are, tho our Author should furnish us with certain and authentick Genealogys, by which we might know the true Heirs of <HI>Nimrod,</HI> and the seventy two Kings that went from <HI>Babylon,</HI> who, as he supposes, gave beginning to all the Kingdoms of the Earth.</P>
<P>Moreover, if the Right be Universal, it must be in one; for the World being butone, the whole Right of commanding it cannot at the same time be in many, and proceed from the Ordinance of God, or of Man. It cannot proceed from the Ordinance of God; for he dos nothing in vain: He never gave a Right that could not be executed. No man can govern that which he dos not so much as know: No man did ever know all the World; no man therefore did or could govern it: and none could be ap∣pointed by God to do that which is absolutely impossible to be done; for it could not consist with his Wisdom. We find this in our selves. It were a shame for one of us poor, weak, short-sighted Creatures, in the dispo∣sal of our Affairs, to appoint such a method, as were utterly ineffectual for the Preservation of our Familys, or destructive to them; and the blasphemy of imputing to God such an Ordinance as would be a reproach to one of us, can sute only with the wicked and impudent Fury of such as our Author, who delights in Monsters. This also shews us that it can∣not be from Men: One, or a few, may commit Follys, but Mankind dos not universally commit, and perpetually persist in any: They cannot therefore, by a general and permanent Authority, enact that which is ut∣terly absurd and impossible; or if they do, they destroy their own Nature, and can no longer deserve the Name of reasonable Creatures. There can be therefore no such man; and the Folly of seeking him, or his Heir that never was, may be left to the Disciples of <HI>Filmer.</HI></P>
<P>The Difficultys are as great, if it be said, The World might be divi∣ded into parcels, and we are to seek the Heirs of the first Possessors; for besides that no man can be oblig'd to seek that which cannot be found, (all men knowing that <HI>Caliginosa nocte haec premit Deus)</HI> and that the Genealogys of Mankind are so confus'd, that, unless possibly among the <HI>Jews,</HI> we have reason to believe there is not a man in the world who knows his own Original, it could be of no advantage to us tho we knew that of every one; for the Division would be of no value, unless it were at the first rightly made by him who had all the Authority in himself, (which dos no where appear) and rightly deduc'd to him, who, accor∣ding to that division, claims a right to the Parcel he enjoys. And I fear our Author would terribly shake the Crowns, in which the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> are concern'd, if they should be persuaded to search into the Ge∣nealogys of their Princes, and to judg of their Rights according to the proofs they should give of Titles rightly deduc'd by succession of Blood from the seventy two first Kings, from whom our Author fancys all the Kingdoms of the World to be deriv'd.</P>
<P>Besides, tho this were done, it would be to no purpose; for the seventy two were not sent out by <HI>Noah,</HI> nor was he or his Sons of that number; but they went, or were sent, from <HI>Babylon</HI> where <HI>Nimrod</HI> reign'd, who, as has bin already prov'd, neither had, nor could have any right at all, but was a mighty Hunter, even a proud and cruel Tyrant, usurping a Power to which he had no right, and which was perpetually exercis'd by him and his Successors against God and his People. From whence I may safely conclude, That no right can ever be deriv'd; and may justly presume
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
it will be denied by none who are of better Morals, and of more sound Principles in matters of Law and Religion than <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin;</HI> since 'tis no less absurd to deduce a right from him that had none, than to ex∣pect pure and wholesom Waters from a filthy, polluted, and poisonous Fountain.</P>
<P>If it be pretended that some other man since <HI>Noah</HI> had this universal Right, it must either remain in one single person as his right Heir, or be divided. If in one, I desire to know who he is, and where we may find him, that the Empire of the World may be deliver'd to him. But if he cannot be found, the business is at an end: for every man in the World may pretend himself to be the person; and the infinite controversys ari∣sing thereupon can never be decided, unless either the Genealogys of eve∣ry one from <HI>Noah</HI> were extant and prov'd, or we had a Word from Heaven, with a sufficient testimony of his mission who announces it. When this is done, 'twill be time to consider what kind of obedience is due to this wonderfully happy and glorious Person. But whilst the first appears to be absolutely impossible, and we have no promise or reason to expect the other, the Proposition is to be esteem'd one of our Author's empty whimsys, which cannot be receiv'd by mankind, unless they come all to be possest with an Epidemical madness, which would cast them into that which <HI>Hobbs</HI> calls <HI>Bellum omnium contra omnes;</HI> when eve∣ry man's Sword would be drawn against every man, if God should so abandon the World to suffer them to fall into such misery.</P>
<P>If this pretended Right be divided, it concerns us to know by whom, when, how, and to whom: for the division cannot be of any value, unless the Right was originally in one; that he did exercise this Right in making the division; that the parcels into which the World is divided are ac∣cording to the allotment made; and that the Persons claiming them by virtue of it are the true Heirs of those to whom they were first granted. Many other difficultys may be alledg'd no less inextricable than these; but this seeming sufficient for the present, I shall not trouble my self with more, promising that when they shall be remov'd, I will propose others, or confessing my errors, yield up the cause.</P>
<P>But if the Dominion of the whole World cannot belong to any one man, and every one has an equal title to that which should give it; or if it did belong to one, none did ever exercise it in governing the whole, or dividing it; or if he did divide it, no man knows how, when, and to whom; so that they who lay claim to any parcels can give no testi∣mony of that division, nor shew any better title than other men deriv'd from his first Progenitor, to whom 'tis said to have bin granted; and that we have neither a Word, nor the promise of a Word from God to decide the controversys arising thereupon, nor any Prophet giving testimony of his mission that takes upon him to do it, the whole Fabrick of our Au∣thor's Patriarchical Dominion falls to the ground; and they who propose these Doctrins, which (if they were receiv'd) would be a root of perpetu∣al and reconcilable hatred in every man against every man, can be accoun∣ted no less than Ministers of the Devil, tho they want the abilitys he has sometimes infus'd into those who have bin imploy'd upon the like occasi∣ons. And we may justly conclude, that God having never given the whole World to be govern'd by one man, nor prescrib'd any rule for the division of it; nor declar'd where the right of dividing or subdividing that which every man has should terminate; we may safely affirm that the whole is for ever left to the will and discretion of Man: We may enter into, form,
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
 and continue in greater or lesser Societys, as best pleases our selves: The right of Paternity as to Dominion is at an end, and no more remains, but the love, veneration, and obedience, which proceeding from a due sense of the benefits of Birth and Education, have their root in Gratitude, and are esteem'd sacred and inviolable by all that are sober and vertuous. And as 'tis impossible to transfer these Benefits by inheritance, so 'tis impossible to transfer the Rights arising from them. No man can be my Father but he that did beget me; and 'tis as absurd to say I owe that Duty to one who is not my Father, which I owe to my Father, as to say, he did beget me, who did not beget me; for the obligation that arises from benefits can only be to him that confer'd them. 'Tis in vain to say the same is due to his Heir; for that can take place only when he has but one, which in this case signifies nothing: For if I being the only Son of my Father, inherit his Right, and have the same power over my Children as he had over me; if I had one hundred Brothers, they must all inherit the same; and the Law of <HI>England,</HI> which acknowledges one only Heir, is not ge∣neral, but municipal, and is so far from being general, as the precept of God and Nature, that I doubt whether it was ever known or us'd in any Nation of the World beyond our Island. The words of the Apostle, <HI>If we are Children, we are therefore Heirs and Co-heirs with Christ,</HI> are the voice of God and Nature; and as the universal Law of God and Nature is al∣ways the same, every one of us who have Children, have the same Right over them, as <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> had over theirs; and that Right which was not devolv'd to any one of them, but inherited by them all (I mean the right of Father as Father) not the peculiar promises, which were not according to the Law of Nature, but the election of Grace, is also inherited by every one of us, and ours, that is, by all Mankind. But if that which could be inherited was inherited by all, and it be impossible that a right of Dominion over all can be due to every one, then all that is or can be inherited by every one is that exemption from the Dominion of another, which we call Liberty, and is the gift of God and Nature.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVIII. If a right of Dominion were esteem'd Hereditary according to the Law of Nature, a multitude of destructive and inextricable Controversys would thereupon arise.</HEAD>
<P>THere being no such thing therefore, according to the Law of Na∣ture, as an Hereditary Right to the Dominion of the World, or any part of it; nor any one man that can derive to himself a title from the first Fathers of Mankind, by which he can rightly pretend to be pre∣fer'd before others to that command, or a part of it; and none can be de∣riv'd from <HI>Nimrod,</HI> or other Usurpers, who had none in themselves, we may justly spare our pains of seeking farther into this matter. But as things of the highest importance can never be too fully explain'd; it may not be amiss to observe, That if Mankind could be brought to believe that such a right of Dominion were by the Law of God and Nature here∣ditary, a great number of the most destructive and inextricable Contro∣versys must thereupon arise, which the wisdom and goodness of God can
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
never enjoin, and Nature, which is Reason, can never intend; but at present I shall only mention two, from whence others must perpetually spring. First if there be such a Law, no Human Constitution can alter it; no length of time can be a defence against it: All Governments that are not conformable to it are vicious and void even in their root, and must be so for ever: That which is originally unjust may be justly overthrown. We do not know of any (at least in that part of the World in which we are most concern'd) that is establish'd, or exercis'd with an absolute Pow∣er, as by the Authors of those opinions is esteem'd inseparable from it: Many, as the Empire, and other States, are directly contrary; and on that account can have no Justice in them. It being certain therefore that he or they who exercise those Governments have no right: that there is a Man to whom it dos belong, and no man knowing who he is, there is no one man who has not as good a title to it as any other: There is not there∣fore one who has not a right, as well as any, to overthrow that which has none at all. He that has no part in the Government may destroy it, as well as he that has the greatest; for he neither has that which God or∣dain'd he should have, nor can shew a title to that which he enjoys from that original Prerogative of Birth, from whence it can only be deriv'd.</P>
<P>If it be said, that some Governments are arbitrary, as they ought to be; and <HI>France, Turkey,</HI> and the like be alledg'd as instances, the matter is not mended: for we do not only know when those, who deserve to be re∣garded by us, were not absolute, and how they came to be so; but also, that those very Familys which are now in possession are not of very long continuance, had no more title to the original right we speak of than any other men, and consequently can have none to this day. And tho we cannot perhaps say that the Governments of the barbarous Eastern Na∣tions were ever other than they are, yet the known Original of them deprives them of all pretence to the Patriarchical Inheritance; and they may be as justly as any other depriv'd of the Power to which they have no title.</P>
<P>In the second place, tho all mens Genealogys were extant, and ful∣ly verifi'd, and it were allow'd that the Dominion of the World, or eve∣ry part of it, did belong to the right Heir of the first Progenitor, or any other to whom the first did rightly assign the Parcel, which is under question; yet it were impossible for us to know who should be esteem'd the true Heir, or according to what rule he should be judg'd so to be: for God has not by a precise word determin'd it, and Men cannot agree a∣bout it, as appears by the various Laws and Customs of several Nations, disposing severally of Hereditary Dominions.</P>
<P>'Tis a folly to say, they ought to go to the next in blood; for 'tis not known who is that next. Some give the preference to him who amongst many Competitors is the fewest degrees remov'd from their common Pro∣genitor who first obtain'd the Crown: Others look only upon the last that possest it. Some admit of Representation, by which means the Grand∣child of a King by his eldest Son, is prefer'd before his second Son, he being said to represent his dead Father, who was the eldest: Others ex∣clude these, and advance the younger Son, who is nearer by one degree to the common Progenitor that last enjoy'd the Crown than the Grand∣child. According to the first rule, <HI>Richard</HI> II. was advanc'd to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> as Son of the eldest Son of <HI>Edward</HI> III. before his Uncles, who by one degree were nearer to the last Possessor: And in pursuance of the second, <HI>Sancho</HI> sirnam'd the Brave, second Son of <HI>Alphonso</HI> the Wise,
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
 King of <HI>Castile,</HI> was prefer'd before <HI>Alphonso</HI> Son of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> his eldest Brother, according to the Law of <HI>Thanestry,</HI> which was in force in <HI>Spain</HI> ever since we have had any knowledg of that Country, as appears by the contest between <HI>Corbis</HI> and <HI>Orsua,</HI> decided by Combat before <HI>Scipio Africanus;</HI> continu'd in full force as long as the Kingdom of the <HI>Goths</HI> last∣ed, and was ever highly valu'd, till the House of <HI>Austria</HI> got possession of that Country, and introduc'd Laws and Customs formerly unknown to the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The Historys of all Nations furnish us with innumerable Examples of both sorts; and whosoever takes upon him to determin which side is in the right, ought to shew by what authority he undertakes to be the Judg of Mankind, and how the infinite breaches thereby made upon the rights of the governing Familys shall be cur'd, without the overthrow of those that he shall condemn, and of the Nations where such Laws have bin in force as he dislikes: and till that be done, in my opinion, no place will afford a better lodging for him that shall impudently assume such a Pow∣er, than the new buildings in <HI>Moor-Fields.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis no less hard to decide whether this next Heir is to be sought in the Male Line only, or whether Females also may be admitted. If we fol∣low the first as the Law of God and Nature, the title of our <HI>English</HI> Kings is wholly abolish'd; for not one of them since <HI>Henry</HI> the 1<HI>st</HI> has had the least pretence to an inheritance by the Masculine Line; and if it were necessary, we have enough to say of those that were before him.</P>
<P>If it be said, that the same Right belongs to Females, it ought to be prov'd that Women are as fit as Men to perform the Office of a King, that is, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> said to <HI>Samuel,</HI> to go in and out before us, to judg us, and to fight our Battels; for it were an impious folly to say that God had ordain'd those for the Offices on which the good of Mankind so much de∣pends, who by nature are unable to perform the dutys of them. If on the other side, the sweetness, gentleness, delicacy, and tenderness of the Sex render them so unfit for manly exercises, that they are accounted ut∣terly repugnant to, and inconsistent with that modesty which dos so emi∣nently shine in all those that are good amongst them; that Law of Na∣ture which should advance them to the Government of Men, would over∣throw its own Work, and make those to be the Heads of Nations, which cannot be the Heads of privat Familys; for, as the Apostle says, <HI>The Wo∣man is not the head of the Man, but the Man is the head of the Women.</HI> This were no less than to oblige Mankind to lay aside the name of reasonable Creature: for if Reason be his Nature, it cannot enjoin that which is con∣trary to it self; if it be not, the definition <HI>Homo est animal rationale,</HI> is false, and ought no longer to be assum'd.</P>
<P>If any man think these Arguments to be mistaken or misappli'd, I de∣sire him to enquire of the <HI>French</HI> Nation on what account they have al∣ways excluded Females, and such as descended from them? How comes the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> to be advanc'd to the Throne before a great Num∣ber of Familys that come from the Daughters of the House of <HI>Valois?</HI> Or what title those could have before the Daughters of the other Lines, descended from <HI>Hugh Capet, Pepin, Meroveus,</HI> or <HI>Pharamond?</HI> I know not how such questions would be receiv'd; but I am inclin'd to think that the wickedness and folly of those who should thereby endeavour to over∣throw the most antient and most venerated Constitutions of the greatest Nations, and by that means to involve them in the most inextricable diffi∣cultys, would be requited only with Stones.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49"/>
It cannot be denied, that the most valiant, wise, learned, and best po¦lish'd Nations have always follow'd the same Rule, tho the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Reginarum{que} sub armis</L>

But if this be not enough, the Law of God, that wholly omits Females, is sufficient to shew that Nature, which is his Handmaid, cannot advance them. When God describes who should be the King of his People (if they would have one) and how he should govern; no mention is made <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE>of Daughters. The <HI>Israelites</HI> offer'd the Kingdom to <HI>Gideon,</HI> and to his Sons: God promis'd, and gave it to <HI>Saul, David, Jeroboam, Jehu,</HI> and their Sons. When all of them, save <HI>David,</HI> by their Crimes fell from the Kingdom, the Males only were extirpated; and the Females who had no part in the Promises, did not fall under the Penaltys, or the Ven∣geance that was executed upon those Familys: and we do not in the Word of God, or in the History of the <HI>Jews,</HI> hear of any Feminin Reign, except that which was usurp'd by <HI>Athaliah;</HI> nor that any consideration was had of their Descendents in relation to the Kingdom: which is e∣nough to shew that it is not according to the Law of God, nor to the Law of Nature, which cannot differ from it. So that Females, or such as derive their right by inheritance from Females, must have it from some other Law, or they can have none at all.</P>
<P>But tho this question were authentically decided, and concluded that Females might or might not succeed, we should not be at the end of our contests: for if they were excluded, it would not from thence follow, as in <HI>France,</HI> that their Descendents should be so also; for the Privilege which is denied to them, because they cannot, without receding from the modesty and gentleness of the Sex, take upon them to execute all the Dutys requir'd, may be transfer'd to their Children, as <HI>Henry</HI> the second and <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh were admitted, tho their Mothers were re∣jected.</P>
<P>If it be said that every Nation ought in this to follow their own Con∣stitutions, we are at an end of our Controversys; for they ought not to be follow'd, unless they are rightly made: They cannot be rightly made, if they are contrary to the universal Law of God and Nature. If there be a general Rule, 'tis impossible but some of them, being directly contrary to each other, must be contrary to it. If therefore all of them are to be follow'd, there can be no general Law given to all; but every People is by God and Nature left to the liberty of regulating these matters relat∣ing to themselves according to their own prudence or convenience: and this seems to be so certainly true, that whosoever dos, as our Author, propose Doctrins to the contrary, must either be thought rashly to utter that which he dos not understand, or maliciously to cast balls of Division among all Nations, whereby every man's Sword would be drawn against every man, to the total subversion of all Order and Government.</P>

<HEAD> SECT. XIX. Kings cannot confer the right of Father upon Princes, nor Princes upon Kings.</HEAD>
<P>LEST what has bin said before by our Author should not be suffici∣ent to accomplish his design of bringing confusion upon Mankind, and some may yet lie still for want of knowing at whose command he should cut his Brother's throat, if he has not power or courage to set up a title for himself, he has a new project that would certainly do his work, if it were receiv'd. Not content with the absurditys and untruths alrea∣dy utter'd in giving the incommunicable right of Fathers, not only to those who, as is manifestly testify'd by sacred and profane Historys, did usurp a power over their Fathers, or such as ow'd no manner of obedi∣ence to them: and justifying those Usurpations, which are most odious to God and all good men, he now fancys a Kingdom so gotten may es∣cheat for want of an Heir; whereas there is no need of seeking any, if Usurpation can confer a Right, and that he who gets the Power into his hands, ought to be reputed the right Heir of the first Progenitor; for such a one will seldom be wanting, if violence and fraud be justified by the command of God, and Nations stand oblig'd to render obedience, till a stronger or more successful Villain throws him from the Throne he had invaded. But if it should come to pass that no man would step into the vacant place, he has a new way of depriving the People of their Right to provide for the Government of themselves. <HI>Because,</HI> says he, <HI>the de∣pendency of antient Familys is oft obscure, and worn out of knowledg; there∣fore the Wisdom of all or most Princes has thought fit many times to adopt those for Heads of Familys, and Princes of Provinces, whose merits, abili∣tys, or fortunes have ennobled them, and made them fit and capable of such Royal Favours: All such prime Heads and Fathers have power to consent to the uniting and conferring of their fatherly Right and Sovereignty on whom they please,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I may justly ask how any one or more Familys come to be esteem'd more antient than others, if all are descended from one common Father, as the Scriptures testify; or to what purpose it were to inquire what Fa∣milys were the most antient, if there were any such, when the youngest and most mean by usurpation gets an absolute right of Dominion over the eldest, tho his own Progenitors, as <HI>Nimrod</HI> did: but I may certainly conclude, That whatever the Right be that belongs to those antient Fa∣milys, it is inherent in them, and cannot be confer'd on any other by any human Power; for it proceeds from Nature only. The Duty I owe to my Father dos not arise from an usurp'd or delegated Power, but from my birth deriv'd from him; and 'tis as impossible for any man to usurp or receive, by the grant of another, the right of a Father over me, as for him to become, or pretend to be made my Father by another who did not beget me. But if he say true, this right of Father dos not arise from Nature; nor the obedience that I owe to him that begot me, from the benefits which I receiv'd, but is merely an artificial thing depending upon the Will of another: and that we may be sure there can be no error in this, our Author attributes it to the wisdom of Princes. But before this

comes to be authentick, we must at the least be sure that all Princes have this great and profound Wisdom, which our Author acknowledges to be in them, and which is certainly necessary for the doing of such great things, if they were refer'd to them. They seem to us to be born like other men, and to be generally no wiser than other men. We are not oblig'd to believe that <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was wise, till God had given him the heart of a man; or that his Grandson <HI>Belshazzar,</HI> who being laid in the balance was found too light, had any such profound Wisdom. <HI>Aha∣suerus</HI> shew'd it not in appointing all the People of God to be slain, upon a Lie told to him by a Rascal; and the matter was not very much mend∣ed, when being inform'd of the truth, he gave 'em leave to kill as many of their Enemys as they pleas'd. The hardness of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s heart, and the overthrow thereby brought upon himself and People, dos not argue so profound a Judgment as our Author presumes every Prince must have: And 'tis not probable that <HI>Samuel</HI> would have told <HI>Saul, He had done foo∣lishly,</HI> if Kings had always bin so exceeding wise: Nay, if Wisdom had bin annex'd to the Character, <HI>Solomon</HI> might have spar'd the pains of asking it from God, and <HI>Rehoboam</HI> must have had it. Not to multiply ex∣amples out of Scripture, 'tis believ'd that <HI>Xerxes</HI> had not inflicted Stripes upon the Sea for breaking his Navy in pieces, if he had bin so very wise. <HI>Caligula</HI> for the same reason might have sav'd the labour of making love to the Moon, or have chosen a fitter Subject to advance to the Consulat than his Horse <HI>Incitatus: Nero</HI> had not endeavour'd to make a Woman of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sueton.</NOTE>a Man, nor married a Man as a Woman. Many other Examples might be alledg'd to shew that Kings are not always wise: and not only the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Satyrist, who says <HI>Quicquid delirant Reges,</HI> &amp;c. shews that he did <NOTE PLACE="marg">Horat.</NOTE>not believe them to be generally wiser than other men; but <HI>Solomon</HI> him∣self judges them to be as liable to infirmitys, when he prefers a wise Child before an old and foolish King. If therefore the strength of our Author's Argument lies in the certainty of the Wisdom of Kings, it can be of no value, till he proves it to be more universal in them than History or Experience will permit us to believe. Nay, if there be Truth or Wisdom in the Scripture, which frequently represents the wicked Man as a Fool, we cannot think that all Kings are wise, unless it be prov'd that none of them have bin wicked; and when this is perform'd by <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Disci∣ples, I shall confess my error.</P>
<P>Men give testimony of their Wisdom, when they undertake that which they ought to do, and rightly perform that which they undertake; both which points do utterly fail in the subject of our Discourse. We have of∣ten heard of such as have adopted those to be their Sons who were not so, and some Civil Laws approve it. This signifies no more, than that such a Man, either thro affection to one who is not his Son, or to his Parents▪ or for some other reason, takes him into his Family, and shews kindness to him, as to his Son: but the adoption of Fathers is a whimsical piece of nonsense. If this be capable of an aggravation, I think none can be greater, than not to leave it to my own discretion, who having no Fa∣ther, may resolve to pay the Duty I ow'd to my Father to one who may have shew'd Kindness to me; but for another to impose a Father upon a Man, or a People compos'd of Fathers, or such as have Fathers, where∣by they should be depriv'd of that natural Honour and Right which he makes the foundation of his Discourse, is the utmost of all absurditys. If any Prince therefore has ever undertaken to appoint Fathers of his Peo∣ple, he cannot be accounted a man of profound Wisdom, but a Fool or a
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
 Madman; and his Acts can be of no value. But if the thing were con∣sonant to Nature, and refer'd to the Will of Princes (which I abso∣lutely deny) the frequent Extravagancys committed by them in the ele∣vation of their Favorites, shews that they intend not to make them Fa∣thers of the People, or know not what they do when they do it.</P>
<P>To chuse or institute a Father is nonsense in the very term; but if any were to be chosen to perform the Office of Fathers to such as have none, and are not of age to provide for themselves (as men do Tutors or Guar∣dians for Orphans) none could be capable of being elected, but such as in kindness to the person they were to take under their care, did most re∣semble his true Father, and had the virtues and abilitys requir'd rightly to provide for his good. If this fails, all Right ceases; and such a corruption is introduc'd as we saw in our Court of Wards, which the Nation could not bear, when the Institution was perverted, and the King, who ought to have taken a tender care of the Wards and their Estates, deliver'd 'em as a prey to those whom he favour'd.</P>
<P>Our Author ridiculously attributes the Title and Authority of Father to the word <HI>Prince;</HI> for it has none in it, and signifies no more than a Man, who in some kind is more eminent than the Vulgar. In this sense <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trecenti Ro∣manae juventu∣tis Principes. <HI>T. Liv.</HI></NOTE><HI>Mutius Scaevola</HI> told <HI>Porsenna,</HI> that <HI>Three hundred Princes of the</HI> Roman <HI>Youth had conspir'd against him:</HI> By which he could not mean that three hundred Fathers of the <HI>Roman</HI> Youth, but three hundred <HI>Roman</HI> young men had conspir'd; and they could not be Fathers of the City, unless they had bin Fathers of their own Fathers. <HI>Princeps Senatus</HI> was under∣stood in the same sense; and <HI>T. Sempronius</HI> the Censor, chusing <HI>Q. Fa∣bius</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Liv.</HI> l. 7.</NOTE><HI>Maximus</HI> to that Honour, gave for a reason, <HI>Se lecturum Q. Fabi∣um Maximum, quem tum Principem Romanae Civitatis esse, vel Anni∣bale judice, dicturus esset;</HI> which could not be understood that <HI>Hannibal</HI> thought him to be the Father or Lord of the City (for he knew he was not) but the Man who for Wisdom and Valour was the most eminent in it.</P>
<P>The like are and ought to be the Princes of every Nation; and tho something of Honour may justly be attributed to the Descendents of such as have done great Services to their Country, yet they who degenerate from them cannot be esteem'd Princes; much less can such Honours or Rights be confer'd upon Court-creatures or Favorites. <HI>Tiberius, Cali∣gula, Claudius, Nero, Galba,</HI> and others, could advance <HI>Macro, Pallas, Narcissus, Tigellinus, Vinnius, Laco,</HI> and the like, to the highest de∣grees of Riches and Power; but they still continu'd to be Villains, and so they died.</P>
<P>No wise or good Man ever thought otherwise of those, who thro the folly of Princes have bin advanc'd to the highest places in several Coun∣trys. The madness of attributing to them a paternal power, seems to have bin peculiarly reserv'd to compleat the insamy of our Author; for he only could acknowledg a cooptitious Father, or give to another man the power of chusing him. I confess that a man in his infancy may have bin expos'd, like <HI>Moses, Cyrus, Oedipus, Romulus:</HI> He may have bin taken in War; or by the charity of some good person sav'd from the teeth of wild Beasts, or from the Sword by which his Parents fell, and may have bin educated with that care which Fathers usually have of their Children: 'tis reasonable that such a one in the whole course of his life should pay that veneration and obedience to him, who gave him as it were a second birth, which was due to his natural Father; and this, tho improperly,
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
may be call'd an Adoption. But to think that any man can assume it to himself, or confer it upon another, and thereby arrogate to himself the service and obedience, which, by the most tender and sacred Laws of Nature, we owe to those from whom we receive Birth and Education, is the most preposterous folly that hitherto has ever enter'd into the heart of man.</P>
<P>Our Author nevertheless is not asham'd of it, and gives Reasons no way unsutable to the Proposition. <HI>Men are,</HI> says he, <HI>adopted Fathers of Provinces for their Abilitys, Merits, or Fortunes.</HI> But these Abilitys can simply deserve nothing; for it they are ill employ'd, they are the worst of Vices, and the most powerful Instruments of Mischief. Merits, in regard of another, are nothing unless they be to him; and he alone can merit from me the respect due to a Father, who has confer'd Benefits upon me, in some measure proportionable to those which we usually re∣ceive from our Fathers: and the world may judg, whether all the Court-Ministers and Favorites that we have known, do upon this account de∣serve to be esteem'd Fathers of Nations. But to allow this on account of their Fortunes, is, if possible, more extravagant than any thing that has bin yet utter'd. By this account <HI>Mazarin</HI> must have bin Father of the <HI>French</HI> Nation: The same Right was inherited by his chast Niece, and remain'd in her, till she and her silly Husband dissipated the Treasures which her Uncle had torn from the Bowels of that People. The Parti∣zans may generally claim the same Right over the Provinces they have pillag'd: <HI>Old Audley, Dog Smith,</HI> Bp <HI>Duppa, Brownloe, Child, Dashwood, Fox,</HI> &amp;c. are to be esteem'd Fathers of the People of <HI>England.</HI> This Doctrin is perfectly Canonical, if <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin</HI> were good Divines; and Legal, if they judg'd more rightly touching matters of Law. But if it be absurd and detestable, they are to be reputed Men, who, by attri∣buting the highest Honours to the vilest Wretches of the world, for what they had gain'd by the most abominable means, endeavour to encrease those Vices, which are already come to such a height, that they can by no other way be brought to a greater. Daily experience too plainly shews, with what rage Avarice usually fills the hearts of men. There are not many destructive Villanys committed in the World, that do not proceed from it. In this respect 'tis call'd <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and <HI>the root of all evil. Solomon</HI> warns us to beware of such as make hast to grow rich, and says, they shall not be innocent. But 'tis no matter what the Pro∣phets, the Apostles, or the wisest of men say of Riches, and the ways of gaining them; for our Author tells us, that men of the greatest Fortunes, without examining how they came to them, or what use they make of them, deserve to be made Fathers of Provinces.</P>
<P>But this is not his only quarrel with all that is just and good: His whole Book goes directly against the letter and spirit of the Scripture. The work of all those, whom God in several Ages has rais'd up to announce his Word, was to abate the Lusts and Passions that arise in the hearts of men; to shew the vanity of worldly Enjoyments, with the dangers that accom∣pany Riches and Honors, and to raise our hearts to the love of those Trea∣sures that perish not. Honest and wise men, following the Light of Na∣ture, have in some measure imitated this. Such as liv'd private lives, as <HI>Plato, Socrates, Epictetus,</HI> and others, made it their business to abate mens Lusts, by shewing the folly of seeking vain Honors, useless Riches, or unsatissying Pleasures; and those who were like to them, if they were rais'd to supreme Magistracys, have endeavour'd by the severest Punish∣ments
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
 to restrain men from commiting the Crimes by which Riches are most commonly gain'd: but <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin</HI> lead us into a new way. If they deserve credit, whosoever would become supreme Lord and Father of his Country, absolute, sacred and inviolable, is only to kill him that is in the head of the Government: Usurpation confers an equal Right with Election or Inheritance: We are to look upon the Pow∣er, not the Ways by which it is obtain'd: Possession only is to be re∣garded; and men must venerate the present Power, as set up by God, tho gain'd by Violence, Treachery or Poison: Children must not impose Laws upon, nor examin the Actions of their Father. Those who are a little more modest, and would content themselves with the Honour of being Fathers and Lords only of Provinces, if they get Riches by the sa∣vour of the King, or the favour of the King by Riches, may receive that honour from him: The Lord Paramount may make them peculiar Lords of each Province as sacred as himself; and by that means every man shall have an immediat and a subaltern Father. This would be a Spur to excite even the most sleeping Lusts; and a Poison that would fill the gentlest Spirits with the most violent Furys. If men should believe this, there would hardly be found one of whom it might not be said, <HI>Hac spe, minanti fulmen occurret Jovi.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. Theb.</NOTE> No more is requir'd to fill the World with Fire and Blood, than the reception of these Precepts: No man can look upon that as a Wickedness, which shall render him Sacred; nor fear to attempt that which shall make him God's Vicegerent. And I doubt, whether the wickedness of filling mens heads with such Notions was ever equal'd, unless by him who said, <HI>Ye shall not die, but be as Gods.</HI></P>
<P>But since our Author is pleas'd to teach us these strange things, I wish he would also have told us, how many men in every Nation ought to be look'd upon as adopted Fathers: What proportion of Riches, Ability or Merit, is naturally or divinely requir'd to make them capable of this sublime Character: Whether the Right of this Chimerical Father dos not destroy that of the Natural; or whether both continue in force, and men thereby stand oblig'd, in despite of what Christ said, to serve two Masters. For if the Right of my Artificial Father arise from any Act of the King, in favour of his Riches, Abilitys or Merit, I ought to know whether he is to excel in all, or any one of these Points; How far, and which of 'em gives the preference; since 'tis impossible for me to deter∣min whether my Father, who may be wise, tho not rich, is thereby devested of his Right, and it comes to be transfer'd to another, who may be rich tho not wise, nor of any personal merit at all, till that Point be decided; or, so much as to guess when I am emancipated from the Duty I owe to him, by whom I was begotten and educated, unless I know whether he be fallen from his Right, thro want of Merit, Wisdom or Estate; and that can never be, till it be determin'd, that he has forfeited his Right, by being defective in all, or any of the three; and what pro∣portion of Merit, Wisdom or Estate is requir'd in him, sor the enjoy∣ment of his Right, or in another that would acquire it: for no man can succeed to the Right of another, unless the first Possessor be rightly de∣priv'd of it; and it cannot belong to them both, because common sense universally teaches, that two distinct Persons cannot, at the same time, and in the same degree, have an equal Right to the same individual thing.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="55"/>
The Right of Father cannot therefore be confer'd upon Princes by Kings, but must for ever follow the Rule of Nature. The Character of a Father is indelible, and incommunicable: The Duty of Children arising from Benefits receiv'd is perpetual, because they can never not have receiv'd them, and can be due only to him from whom they are receiv'd. For these Reasons we see, that such as our Author calls Prin∣ces, cannot confer it upon a King; for they cannot give what they have not in themselves: They who have nothing, can give nothing: They who are only supposititious, cannot make another to be real; and the Whimsy of Kings making Princes to be Fathers, and Princes conferring that Right on Kings, comes to nothing.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XX. All just Magistratical Power is from the People.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING prov'd that the Right of a Father proceeds from the Generation and Education of his Children: That no man can have that Right over those, whom he has not begotten and educated: That every man has it over those who owe their Birth and Education to him: That all the Sons of <HI>Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</HI> and others, did equally inherit it: That by the same Reasons, it dos for ever belong to every man that begets Children; it plainly appears, that no Father can have a Right over others, unless it be by them granted to him, and that he receive his Right from those who granted it. But our Au∣thor, with an admirable sagacity peculiar to himself, discovers, and with equal confidence tells us, that that which is from the People, or the chief Heads of them, is not from the People: <HI>He that is so elected,</HI> says he, <HI>claims not his Right from the People as a Donative, but from God.</HI> That is, if I mistake not, <HI>Romulus</HI> was not made King of the <HI>Romans</HI> by that People, but by God: Those men being newly gather'd together, had two Fathers, tho neither of them had any Children; and no man knew who was their Father, nor which of 'em was the elder: But <HI>Romulus</HI> by the slaughter of his Brother decided all Questions, and purchas'd to himself a Royal Charter from God; and the Act of the People which confer'd the Power on him, was the Act of God. We had formerly learnt, that whatsoever was done by Monarchs, was to be imputed to God; and that whosoever murder'd the Father of a People, acquir'd the same Right to himself: but now it seems, that Nations also have the same privilege, and that God dos what they do. Now I understand why it was said of old, <HI>Vox Populi est Vox Dei:</HI> But if it was so in regard of <HI>Romulus,</HI> the same must be confest of <HI>Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Martius, Tarquinius Priscus,</HI> and <HI>Servius Tullus;</HI> who being all strangers to each other, and most of them Aliens also, were successively advanc'd by the same People, without any respect to the Children, Relations or Heirs of their Predecessors. And I cannot comprehend, why the Act of the same People should not have the same Virtue, and be equally attributed to God, when they gave the same or more power to Consuls, Military Tribunes, <HI>Decemviri,</HI> or Dictators; or why the same Divine Character should not be in the same manner confer'd upon any Magistracys, that by any Peo∣ple have bin, are, or shall be at any time erected for the same ends.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="56"/>
 Upon the same grounds we may conclude, that no Privilege is pecu∣liarly annex'd to any Form of Government; but that all Magistrats are equally the Ministers of God, who perform the Work for which they were instituted; and that the People which institutes them, may propor∣tion, regulate and terminate their Power, as to time, measure, and num∣ber of Persons, as seems most convenient to themselves, which can be no other than their own good. For it cannot be imagin'd that a multitude of People should send for <HI>Numa,</HI> or any other Person to whom they ow'd nothing, to reign over 'em, that he might live in Glory and Pleasure; or for any other reason, than that it might be good for them and their Posterity. This shews the Work of all Magistrats to be always and every where the same, even the doing of Justice, and procuring the Wel∣fare of those that create them. This we learn from common sense: <HI>Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,</HI> and the best human Authors lay it as an un∣movable Foundation, upon which they build their Arguments relating to matters of that nature: And the Apostle from better Authority declares, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.</NOTE><HI>That Rulers are not a terror to good Works, but to Evil: Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same; for he is the Minister of God unto thee for good: But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the Sword in vain; for he is the Minister of God, a revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tim. 2.</NOTE>And the reason he gives <HI>for praying for Kings, and all that are in Autho∣rity,</HI> is, <HI>that we may live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and hone∣sty.</HI> But if this be the Work of the Magistrate, and the glorious Name of God's Minister be given to him for the performance of it, we may ea∣sily see to whom that Title belongs. <HI>His Children and Servants ye are; whose Works ye do.</HI> He therefore, and he only, is the Servant of God, who dos the Work of God; who is a terror to those that do evil, and a praise to those that do well; who bears the Sword for the punishment of Wickedness and Vice, and so governs, that the People may live quietly in all godliness and honesty. The order of his Institution is inverted, and the Institution vacated, if the Power be turn'd to the praise of those that do evil, and becomes a terror to such as do well; and that none who live honestly and justly can be quiet under it. If God be the Fountain of Justice, Mercy and Truth, and those his Servants who walk in them, no exercise of Violence, Fraud, Cruelty, Pride, or Avarice, is patroniz'd by him: and they who are the Authors of those Villanys, cannot but be the Ministers of him, who sets himself up against God; because 'tis im∣possible that Truth and Falshood, Mercy and Cruelty, Justice and the most violent Oppression can proceed from the same Root. It was a folly and a lie in those <HI>Jews,</HI> to call themselves the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who did not the Works of <HI>Abraham;</HI> and Christ declar'd them to be the Chil∣dren <NOTE PLACE="marg">John 8. 39.</NOTE>of the Devil, whose Works they did; which words proceeding from the Eternal Truth, do as well indicate to us whose Child and Ser∣vant every man is to be accounted, as to those who first heard them.</P>
<P>If our Author's former Assertions were void of Judgment and Truth, his next Clause shews a great defect in his Memory, and contradicts the former: <HI>The Judgments of God,</HI> says he, <HI>who has Power to give and take away Kingdoms, are most just; yet the ministry of Men, who execute God's Judgments without Commission, is sinful and damnable.</HI> If it be true, as he says, that we are to look at the Power, not the Ways by which it is gain'd; and that he who has it, whether it be by Usurpation, Conquest, or any other means, is to be accounted as Father, or right Heir to the
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
Father of the People, to which Title the most sublime and divine Pri∣vileges are annex'd; a man who by the most wicked and unjust Actions advances himself to the Power, becomes immediatly the Father of the Peo∣ple, and the Minister of God; which I take to be a piece of Divinity worthy our Author and his Disciples.</P>
<P>It may be doubted what he means by a Commission from God; for we know of none but what is outwardly by his Word, or inwardly by his Spirit; and I am apt to think, that neither he nor his Abettors allowing of either as to the Point in question, he dos foully prevaricate, in alledg∣ing that which he thinks cannot be of any effect. If any man should say, that the Word of God to <HI>Moses, Joshua, Ehud, Gideon, Samuel, Jerobo∣am</HI> and <HI>Jehu,</HI> or any others, are, in the like cases, Rules to be observ'd by all; because that which was from God was good, that which was good, is good; and he that dos good, is justified by it: He would proba∣bly tell us, that what was good in them, is not good in others; and that the Word of God dos justify those only to whom it is spoken: That is to say, No man can execute the just Judgments of God, to the benefit of mankind, according to the Example of those Servants of God, without damnable sin, unless he have a precise Word particularly directed to him for it, as <HI>Moses</HI> had. But if any man should pretend that such a Word was come to him, he would be accounted an Enthusiast, and obtain no credit. So that, which way soever the Clause be taken, it appears to be full of Fraud, confessing only in the Theory, that which he thinks can never be brought into practice; that his beloved Villanys may be thereby secur'd, and that the glorious Examples of the most heroick Actions, per∣form'd by the best and wisest men that ever were in the World for the benefit of mankind, may never be imitated.</P>
<P>The next Clause shews, that I did our Author no wrong in saying, that he gave a right to Usurpation; for he plainly says, <HI>That whether the Prince be the supreme Father of his People, or the true Heir of such a Father; or whether he come to the Crown by Ʋsurpation, or Election of the Nobles or People, or by any other way whatsoever, &amp;c. it is the only Right and Authority of the natural Father.</HI> In the 3<HI>d Chap.</HI> Sect. 8. <HI>It skills not which way the King comes by his Power, whether by Election, Donation, Succession, or by any other means.</HI> And in another place, <HI>That we are to regard the Power, not the Means by which it is gain'd.</HI> To which I need say no more, than that I cannot sufficiently admire the ingeniously invented Title of Father by Usurpation; and confess, that since there is such a thing in the World, to which not only privat men, but whole Nations owe obedience, whatso∣ever has bin said antiently, (as was thought to express the highest excess of Fury and Injustice) as, <HI>Jus datum sceleri; Jus omne in ferro est situm;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucan. &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>Jus licet in jugulos nostros sibi fecerit ense; Sylla potens Marius{que} ferox &amp; Cinna cruentus, Caesareaeque domus series;</HI> were solid Truths, good Law and Divinity; which did not only signify the actual exercise of the Pow∣er, but induc'd a conscientious Obligation of obeying it. The Powers so gain'd, did carry in themselves the most sacred and inviolable Rights; and the actors of the most detestable Villanys thereby became the Mini∣sters of God, and the Fathers of their subdu'd People. Or if this be not true, it cannot be denied, that <HI>Filmer</HI> and his followers, in the most impudent and outragious Blasphemy, have surpast all that have gone be∣fore 'em.</P>
<P>To confirm his Assertion, he gives us a wonderful explanation of the fisth Commandment; which, he says, enjoins Obedience to Princes, un∣der
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
 the terms of, <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother;</HI> drawing this Infe∣rence, <HI>That as all Power is in the Father, the Prince who hath it, cannot be restrain'd by any Law; which being grounded upon the perfect likeness between Kings and Fathers, no man can deny it to be true.</HI> But if <HI>Claudius</HI> was the Father of the <HI>Roman</HI> People, I suppose the chast <HI>Messalina</HI> was the Mo∣ther, and to be honour'd by virtue of the same Commandment: But then I fear that such as met her in the most obscene places, were not only guilty of Adultery, but of Incest. The same Honour must needs belong to <HI>Nero</HI> and his vertuous <HI>Poppaea,</HI> unless it were transfer'd to his new∣made Woman <HI>Sporus;</HI> or perhaps he himself was the Mother, and the glorious Title of <HI>Pater Patriae</HI> belong'd to the Rascal, who married him as a Woman. The like may be said of <HI>Agathocles, Dionysius, Phalaris, Busiris, Machanidas, Peter</HI> the Cruel of <HI>Castile, Christiern</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the last Princes of the House of <HI>Valois</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain.</HI> Those Actions of theirs which men have ever esteem'd most detestable, and the whole course of their abominable Government, did not proceed from Pride, Avarice, Cruelty, Madness and Lust, but from the tender care of most pious Fathers. <HI>Tacitus</HI> sadly describes the state of his Country: <HI>Ʋrbs incendiis vastata, consumptis antiquissimis delubris, ipso Capitolio Civium manibus incenso; pollutae Ceremoniae; magna Adulteria; plenum Exiliis mare; infecti caedibus scopuli; atrocius in Ʋrbe saevitum; Nobilitas, opes, omissi vel gesti honores pro crimine, &amp; ob virtutes certissi∣mum exitium:</HI> But he was to blame; all this proceeded from the ardency of a paternal Affection. When <HI>Nero,</HI> by the death of <HI>Helvidius Priscus</HI> and <HI>Thraseas,</HI> endeavour'd to cut up Vertue by the roots, <HI>ipsam exscindere virtutem,</HI> he did it, because he knew it was good for the World that there should be no vertuous man in it. When he fir'd the City, and when <HI>Caligula</HI> wish'd the People had but one Neck that he might strike it off at one blow, they did it thro a prudent care of their Childrens good, knowing it would be for their advantage to be destroy'd; and that the empty desolated World would be no more troubled with popular Sediti∣ons. By the same rule <HI>Pharaoh, Eglon, Nebuchodonosor, Antiochus, He∣rod,</HI> and the like, were Fathers of the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> And without looking far backward, or depending upon the Faith of History, we may enume∣rate many Princes, who in a perpetual care of their People, have not yielded to <HI>Nero</HI> or <HI>Caligula.</HI> If our Author say true, all those Actions of theirs, which we have ever attributed to the utmost excess of Pride, Cru∣elty, Avarice and Perfidiousness, proceeded from their princely Wisdom and fatherly Kindness to the Nations under 'em: and we are beholden to him for the discovery of so great a Mystery, which has bin hid from man∣kind from the beginning of the World to this day: if not, we may still look upon them as Children of the Devil; and continue to believe, that Princes as well as other Magistrats were set up by the People for the pub∣lick Good; that the Praises given to such as are Wise, Just and Good, are purely personal, and can belong only to those, who by a due exercise of their Power do deserve it, and to no others.</P>

That which I maintain, is the Cause of Mankind; which ought not to suffer, tho Champions of corrupt Princi∣ples have weakly defended, or maliciously betray'd it: and therefore not at all relying on their Authority, I intend to reject whatsoever they say that agrees not with Reason, Scripture, or the approv'd Examples of the best polish'd Nations. He also attacks <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> upon whose Opinions I set a far greater value, in as much as they seem to have pene∣trated more deeply into the secrets of human Nature; and not only to have judg'd more rightly of the Interests of Mankind, but also to have comprehended in their Writings the Wisdom of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> with all that they had learn'd from the <HI>Phaenicians, Egyptians,</HI> and <HI>Hebrews;</HI> which may lead us to the discovery of the Truth we seek. If this be our work, the question is not, whether it be a <HI>Paradox,</HI> or <HI>a receiv'd Opinion, That People naturally govern, or chuse Governors;</HI> but whether it be true or not: for many Paradoxes are true, and the most gross Errors have often bin most common. Tho I hope to prove, that what he calls a Paradox, is not only true; but a Truth planted in the hearts of men, and acknowledg'd so to be by all that have hearkned to the voice of Nature, and disapprov'd by none, but such as thro wickedness, stupidity, or baseness of Spirit, seem to have degenerated into the worst of beasts, and to have retain'd nothing of men, but the outward shape, or the ability of doing those mis∣chiefs which they have learn'd from their Master the Devil.</P>
<P>We have already seen, that the Patriarchical Power resembles not the Regal in principle or practice: that the beginning and continuance of Regal Power was contrary to, and inconsistent with the Patriarchical: that the first Fathers of mankind left all their Children independent on each other, and in an equal liberty of providing for themselves: that every man con∣tinu'd in this liberty, till the number so increas'd, that they became trou∣blesom
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
 and dangerous to each other; and finding no other remedy to the disorders growing, or like to grow among them, join'd many Familys into one civil Body, that they might the better provide for the convenien∣cy, safety, and defence of themselves and their Children. This was a collation of every man's privat Right into a publick Stock; and no one having any other right than what was common to all, except it were that of Fathers over their Children, they were all equally free when their Fa∣thers were dead; and nothing could induce 'em to join, and lessen that natural liberty by joining in Societys, but the hopes of a publick Advan∣tage. Such as were wise and valiant procur'd it, by setting up regular Governments, and placing the best Men in the Administration; whilst the weakest and basest fell under the power of the most boisterous and violent of their Neighbours. Those of the first sort had their root in Wisdom and Justice, and are call'd lawful Kingdoms or Commonwealths; and the Rules by which they are govern'd, are known by the name of Laws. These Governments have ever bin the Nurses of Vertue: The Nations living under them have flourish'd in Peace and Happiness, or made Wars with Glory and Advantage: whereas the other sort spring∣ing from Violence and Wrong, have ever gone under the odious title of Tyrannys; and by fomenting Vices, like to those from whence they grew, have brought shame and misery upon those who were subject to them. This appears so plainly in Scripture, that the assertors of Liberty want no other Patron than God himself; and his Word so fully justifies what we contend for, that it were not necessary to make use of human Au∣thority, if our Adversarys did not oblige us to examin such as are cited by them. This, in our present case, would be an easy work, if our Au∣thor had rightly mark'd the passages he would make use of, or had bin faithful in his Interpretation or Explication of such as he truly cites; but failing grosly in both, 'tis hard to trace him.</P>
<P>He cites the 16<HI>th</HI> Chapter of the third Book of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Politicks, and I do not find there is more than twelve; or tho that Wound might be cur'd, by saying the Words are in the twelfth, his Fraud in pervert∣ing the Sense were unpardonable, tho the other mistake be past over. 'Tis true that <HI>Aristotle</HI> dos there seem to doubt whether there be any such thing as one man naturally a Lord over many Citizens, since a City con∣sists of Equals: but in the whole scope of that Chapter, Book, and his other Writings, he fully shews his doubt did not arise from an imaginati∣on that one man could naturally inherit a Right of Dominion over many not descended from him; or that they were born under a necessity of be∣ing Slaves to him (for such fancys can proceed only from distemper'd Brains) but that Civil Societys aiming at the publick good, those who by nature were endow'd with such Vertues or Talents as were most benefi∣cial to them, ought to be prefer'd. And nothing can be more contrary to the frantick whimsy of our Author, who fancys an hereditary Preroga∣tive of Dominion inherent to a person as Father of a People, or Heir, or to be reputed Heir of the first Father, when 'tis certain he is not, but that either he or his Predecessor came in by Election or Usurpation, than to shew that 'tis only Wisdom, Justice, Valour, and other commendable Vertues, which are not hereditary, that can give the preserence; and that the only reason why it should be given, is, that Men so qualify'd can better than others accomplish the end for which Societys are constituted: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st. Pol.</NOTE>For <HI>tho,</HI> says he, <HI>all are equally free, all are not equally endow'd with those Vertues that render Liberty safe, prosperous, and happy.</HI> That equality
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
which is just among Equals, is just only among Equals; but such as are base, ignorant, vicious, slothful, or cowardly, are not equal in natural or acquir'd Vertues, to the generous, wise, valiant, and industrious; nor equally useful to the Societys in which they live: they cannot there∣fore have an equal part in the Government of 'em, they cannot equally provide for the common good; and 'tis not a personal, but a publick Be∣nefit that is sought in their constitution and continuance. There may be a hundred thousand men in an Army, who are all equally free; but they only are naturally most fit to be Commanders or Leaders, who most ex∣cel in the Vertues requir'd for the right performance of those Offices; and that, not because 'tis good for them to be rais'd above their Brethren, but because 'tis good for their Brethren to be guided by them, as 'tis ever good to be govern'd by the wisest and the best. If the nature of man be Reason, <HI>Detur digniori,</HI> in matters of this kind, is the voice of Nature; and it were not only a deviation from Reason, but a most desperate and mischievous madness, for a Company going to the <HI>Indies,</HI> to give the gui∣dance of their Ship to the Son of the best Pilot in the world, if he want the skill requir'd to that employment, or to one who was maliciously set to destroy them: and he only can have a Right grounded upon the dictates of Nature, to be advanc'd to the Helm, who best knows how to govern it, and has given the best testimonys of his Integrity and Intentions to imploy his skill for the good of those that are imbark'd. But as the work of a Magistrat, especially if he be the supreme, is the highest, noblest, and most difficult that can be committed to the charge of a man, a more excellent Vertue is requir'd in the Person to be advanc'd to it, than for any other; and he that is most excellent in that Vertue, is reasonably and naturally to be prefer'd before any other. <HI>Aristotle</HI> having this in his view, seems to think, that those who believ'd it not to be natural for one man to be Lord of all the Citizens, since a City consists of Equals, had not observ'd that inequality of Endowments, Vertues and Abilitys in men, which render some more fit than others for the performance of their Du∣tys, and the Work intended; but it will not be found, as I suppose, that he did ever dream of a natural Superiority, that any man could ever have in a civil Society, unless it be such a superiority in Vertue as most conduces to the publick good.</P>
<P>He confirms this in proceeding to examin the different sorts of Govern∣ments, according to the different dispositions of Nations; and is so bold to say, That a <HI>popular Government is the best for a People, who are natural∣ly generous and warlike: that the Government of a few sutes best with those, among whom a few men are found to excel others in those Vertues that are profitable to Societys; and that the Government of one is good, when that one dos so far surpass all others in those Vertues, that he has more of them than all the rest of the people together.</HI> And for the same reason that induc'd him to believe that equality is just amongst Equals, he concludes inequali∣ty of Power to be most unjust, unless there be inequality of Merit; and equality of Power to be so also, when there is inequality of Vertue, that being the only rule by which every man's part ought to be regulated.</P>
<P>But if it be neither reasonable nor just that those who are not equal in Vertue should be made equal in Power, or that such as are equal in Ver∣tue should be unequal in Power; the most brutal and abominable of all extravagancys is to make one or a few, who in Vertue and Abilitys to perform Civil Functions are inferior to others, superior to all in power: and the Miserys suffer'd by those Nations, who, inverting the Laws of Na∣ture
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
 and Reason, have plac'd Children or Men of no Vertue in the Go∣vernment, when men that excel'd in all Vertues were not wanting, do so far manifest this Truth, that the pains of proving it may be spar'd.</P>
<P>'Tis not necessary for me to inquire, whether it be possible to find such a Man as <HI>Aristotle</HI> calls <HI>Naturâ Regem;</HI> or whether he intended to recom∣mend <HI>Alexander</HI> to the world for the Man design'd by God and Nature to be King over all, because no man was equal to him in the Vertues that were beneficial to all. For pursuing my Position, that Vertue only can give a just and natural preference, I ingenuously confess, that when such a Man, or race of Men as he describes, shall appear in the world, they carry the true marks of Sovereignty upon them: We ought to believe, that God has rais'd 'em above all, whom he has made to excel all: It were an impious folly to think of reducing him to the ordinary level of Man∣kind, whom God has placed above it. 'Twere better for us to be guid∣ed by him, than to follow our own judgment; nay, I could almost say, 'twere better to serve such a Master, than to be free. But this will be nothing to the purpose, till such a Man, or succession of men do appear; and if our Author would persuade us, that all Mankind, or every parti∣cular, is oblig'd to a perpetual subjection to one Man or Family, upon any other condition, he must do it by the credit of those who favour his De∣sign more than <HI>Aristotle.</HI></P>
<P>I know not who that will be, but am confident he will find no help from <HI>Plato:</HI> for if his Principles be examin'd, by which a grave Author's sense is best comprehended, it will appear, that all his Books of Laws, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato de Leg. c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de Republ.</NOTE>and of a Commonwealth, are chiefly grounded upon this, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Magi∣strats are chosen by Societys, seeking their own good; and that the best men ought to be chosen for the attaining of it:"</Q> whereas his whole design of seeking which is the best form of Government, or what Laws do most conduce to its perfection and permanency, (if one Rule were by nature appointed for all, and none could justly transgress it; if God had design'd an universal Lord over the whole World, or a particular one over every Nation, who could be bound by no Law) were utterly ab∣surd; and they who write Books concerning Political matters, and take upon 'em to instruct Nations how to govern themselves, would be found either foolishly to mispend their time, or impiously to incite People to re∣bel against the Ordinance of God. If this can justly be imputed to <HI>Plato;</HI> he is not the wise Man he is suppos'd to have bin; and can less deserve the title of Divine, which our Author gives him: but if he remain just∣ly free from such Censures, it must be confest, that whilst he seeks what is good for a people, and to convince 'em by reason that it is so, he takes it for granted, that they have a liberty of chusing that which appears to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato de Leg.</NOTE>be the best to them. He first says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That this Good consists in the ob∣taining of Justice; but farther explaining himself, he shews that un∣der the name of Justice, he comprehends all that tends to their perfecti∣on and felicity: in as much as every People, by joining in a civil Socie∣ty, and creating Magistrats, doth seek its own good; and 'tis just, that he or they who are created, should, to the utmost of their power, accomplish the end of their Creation, and lead the People to Justice, without which there is neither perfection nor happiness: That the pro∣per act of Justice is to give to every one his due; to Man that which belongs to Man, and to God that which is God's. But as no man can be just, or desire to be so, unless he know that Justice is good; nor know that it is good, unless he know that original Justice and Good∣ness,
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
thro which all that is just is just, and all that is good is good, 'tis impossible for any man to perform the part of a good Magistrat, unless he have the knowledg of God; or to bring a People to Justice, unless he bring them to the knowledg of God, who is the Root of all Justice and Goodness."</Q> If <HI>Plato</HI> therefore deserve credit, he only can duly perform the part of a good Magistrate, whose moral Vertues are ri∣pen'd and heightned by a superinduction of Divine Knowledg. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The misery of Man proceeds from his being separated from God: This Se∣paration is wrought by corruption; his restitution therefore to Felici∣ty and Integrity, can only be brought about by his reunion to the Good from which he is fallen."</Q> <HI>Plato</HI> looks upon this as the only worthy Ob∣ject of Man's desire: and in his Laws and Politicks he intends not to teach us how to erect Manufactures, and to increase Trade or Riches; but how Magistrats may be helpful to Nations in the manner before menti∣on'd, and consequently what men are fit to be Magistrats. If our Au∣thor therefore would make use of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Doctrin to his end, he ought to have prov'd that there is a Family in every Nation, to the chief of which, and successively to the next in Blood, God dos ever reveal and infuse such a knowledg of himself, as may render him a Light to others; and failing in this, all that he says is to no purpose.</P>
<P>The weakness in which we are born, renders us unable to attain this Good of our selves: we want help in all things, especially in the greatest. The fierce Barbarity of a loose Multitude, bound by no Law, and regu∣lated by no Disciplin, is wholly repugnant to it: Whilst every man fears his Neighbour, and has no other defence than his own strength, he must live in that perpetual anxiety which is equally contrary to that happiness, and that sedate temper of mind which is requir'd for the search of it. The first step towards the cure of this pestilent Evil, is for many to join in one body, that every one may be protected by the united force of all, and the various Talents that men possess, may by good disciplin be ren∣der'd useful to the whole; as the meanest piece of wood or stone being plac'd by a wise Architect, conduces to the beauty of the most glorious Building. But every man bearing in his own breast Affections, Passions, and Vices repugnant to this end, and no man owing any submission to his Neighbour; none will subject the correction or restriction of them∣selves to another, unless he also submit to the same Rule. They are rough pieces of timber or stone, which 'tis necessary to cleave, saw, or cut: This is the work of a skilful Builder, and he only is capable of e∣recting a great Fabrick, who is so: Magistrats are Political Architects; and they only can perform the Work incumbent on them, who excel in Political Vertues. Nature, in variously framing the minds of men, ac∣cording to the variety of Uses in which they may be employ'd, in order to the institution and preservation of Civil Societys, must be our Guide, in allotting to every one his proper work. And <HI>Plato</HI> observing this Va∣riety, affirms, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Laws of Nature cannot be more absurdly vio∣lated, than by giving the Government of a People to such, as do not excel others in those Arts and Vertues that tend to the ultimate Ends for which Governments are instituted."</Q> By this means those who are Slaves by Nature, or render'd so by their Vices, are often set above those that God and Nature had fitted for the highest Commands; and Societys which subsist only by order, fall into corruption, when all Order is so preposterously inverted, and the most extreme Confusion introduc'd. This is an Evil that <HI>Solomon</HI> detested: <HI>Folly is set in great dignity, and the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 10. 7▪</NOTE>
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
 <HI>Rich sit in low places: I have seen Servants upon Horses, and Princes walking as Servants upon the Earth.</HI> They who understand <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Language, will easily see, that the Rich, and the Princes he means, are such only who are rich in Vertue and Wisdom, and who ought to be pre∣fer'd for those Qualitys: And when he says, a Servant that reigneth is one of the <HI>three things the Earth cannot bear,</HI> he can only mean such as de∣serve to be Servants; for when they reign, they do not serve, but are serv'd by others: Which perfectly agrees with what we learn from <HI>Pla∣to,</HI> and plainly shews, that true Philosophy is perfectly conformable with what is taught us by those who were divinely inspir'd. Therefore tho I should allow to our Author, that <HI>Aristotle,</HI> in those words, <HI>It seems to some, not to be natural for one Man to be Lord of all the Citizens, since the Ci∣ty consists of Equals,</HI> did speak the opinion of others rather than his own; and should confess that he and his Master <HI>Plato</HI> did acknowledg a natu∣ral inequality among men, it would be nothing to his purpose: for the Inequality, and the rational Superiority due to some, or to one, by rea∣son of that Inequality, did not proceed from Blood or Extraction, and had nothing Patriarchical in it; but consisted solely in the Vertues of the Persons, by which they were render'd more able than others to perform their Duty, for the good of the Society. Therefore if these Authors are to be trusted, whatsoever place a Man is advanc'd to in a City, 'tis not for his own sake, but for that of the City; and we are not to ask who was his Father, but what are his Vertues in relation to it. This induces a necessity of distinguishing between a simple and a relative Inequality; for if it were possible for a man to have great Vertues, and yet no way bene∣ficial to the Society of which he is, or to have some one Vice that renders 'em useless, he could have no pretence to a Magistratical Power more than any other. They who are equally free, may equally enjoy their freedom; but the Powers that can only be executed by such as are endow'd with great Wisdom, Justice and Valor, can belong to none, nor be rightly confer'd upon any, except such as excel in those Vertues. And if no such can be found, all are equally by turns to participate of the Ho∣nors annex'd to Magistracy; and Law, which is said to be written Rea∣son, cannot justly exalt those, whom Nature, which is Reason, has de∣prest, nor depress those whom Nature has exalted. It cannot make Kings Slaves, nor Slaves Kings, without introducing that Evil, which, if we believe <HI>Solomon,</HI> and the Spirit by which he spoke, <HI>the Earth cannot bear.</HI> This may discover what Lawgivers deserve to be reputed wise or just; and what Decrees or Sanctions ought to be reputed Laws. <HI>Aristotle</HI> proceeding by this Rule, rather tells us who is naturally a King, than where we should find him; and after having given the highest Praises to this true natural King and his Government, he sticks not to declare that of one Man, in Vertue equal or inferior to others, to be a mere Tyran∣ny, even the worst of all, as it is the corruption of the best, (or, as our Author calls it, the most Divine) and such as can be fit only for those barbarous and stupid Nations, which, tho bearing the shape of Men, are little different from Beasts. Whoever therefore will from <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s words inser, that Nature has design'd one Man, or succession of Men, to be Lords of every Country, must shew that Man to be endow'd with all the Vertues that render him fit for so great an Office, which he dos not bear for his own Pleasure, Glory or Profit, but for the good of those that are under him; and if that be not done, he must look after other Pa∣trons than <HI>Aristotle</HI> for his opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="65"/>
<HI>Plato</HI> dos more explicitly say, that the Civil or Politick Man, the Shep∣herd, Father, or King of the People, is the same, design'd for the same Work, enabled to perform it by the excellency of the same Vertues, and made perfect by the infusion of the divine Wisdom. This is <HI>Plato</HI>'s Monarch, and I confess, that wheresoever he dos appear in the World, he ought to be accounted as sent from God for the good of that People. His Government is the best that can be set up among Men; and if assu∣rance can be given, that his Children, Heirs or Successors, shall for ever be equal to him in the abovemention'd Vertues, it were a folly and a sin to bring him under the government of any other, or to an equality with them, since God had made him to excel them all; and 'tis better for them to be rul'd by him, than to follow their own judgment. This is that which gives him the preference: <HI>He is wise thro the knowledg of the Truth,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ib. l. 1, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE><HI>and thereby becomes good, happy, pure, beautiful and perfect. The divine Light shining forth in him, is a guide to others; and he is a fit Leader of a People to the good that he enjoys.</HI> If this can be exprest by words in fashi∣on, this is his <HI>Prerogative;</HI> this is the <HI>Royal Charter</HI> given to him by God, and to him only, who is so adapted for the performance of his Office. He that should pretend to the same Privileges, without the same Abilitys to perform the Works for which they are granted, would exceed the fol∣ly of a Child, that takes upon him a burden which can only be born by a Giant; or the madness of one who presumes to give Physick, and un∣derstands not the Art of a Physician, thereby drawing guilt upon him∣self, and death upon his Patient. It were as vain to expect that a Child should carry the Giant's burden, and that an ignorant man should give wholsom Physick, as that one who lives void of all knowledg of Good, should conduct men to it. Whensoever therefore such a Man, as is a∣bove-describ'd, dos not appear, Nature and Reason instruct us to seek him or them who are most like to him; and to lay such burdens upon 'em as are proportionable to their strength; which is as much as to say, to prefer every man according to his merit, and assign to every one such Works as he seems able to accomplish.</P>
<P>But that <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Aristotle</HI> may neither be thought unreasonably ad∣dicted to Monarchy; nor, wholly rejecting it, to have talk'd in vain of a Monarch, that is not to be found; 'tis good to consider that this is not a siction. <HI>Moses, Joshua, Samuel,</HI> and others, were such as they define; and were made to be such, by that communion with God which <HI>Plato</HI> requires: And he in all his Writings, intending the institution of such a Disciplin as should render men happy, wise and good, could take no bet∣ter way to bring his Countrymen to it, than by shewing 'em that Wisdom, Vertue, and Purity only could make a natural difference a∣mong men.</P>
<P>'Tis not my work to justify these Opinions of <HI>Plato</HI> and his Scholar <HI>A∣ristotle:</HI> They were men, and, tho wise and learned, subject to error. If they err'd in these Points, it hurts not me, nor the Cause I maintain; since I make no other use of their Books, than to shew the impudence and prevarication of those, who gather small scraps out of good Books, to ju∣stify their Assertions concerning such Kings as are known amongst us; which being examin'd, are found to be wholly against 'em; and if they were follow'd, would destroy their Persons and Power.</P>
<P>But our Author's intention being only to cavil, or to cheat such as are not vers'd in the Writings of the Antients, or at least to cause those who do not make Truth their Guide, to waver and fluctuate in their Discourses,
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
 he dos in one page say, <HI>That without doubt</HI> Moses <HI>his History of the Crea∣tion guided these Philosophers in finding out this lineal Subjection.</HI> And in the next affirms, <HI>That the Ignorance of the Creation occasion'd several a∣mong the Heathen Philosophers to think that men met together as herds of Cat∣tel.</HI> Whereas they could not have bin ignorant of the Creation, if they had read the Books that <HI>Moses</HI> writ; and having that knowledg, they could not think that men met together as herds of Cattel. However, I deny that any of 'em did ever dream of that lineal Subjection, deriv'd from the first Parents of mankind, or that any such thing was to be learn'd from <HI>Moses.</HI> Tho they did not perhaps justly know the beginning of Mankind, they did know the beginnings and progress of the Govern∣ments under which they liv'd: and being assur'd that the first Kingdoms had bin those, which they call'd <HI>Heroum Regna,</HI> that is, of those who had bin most beneficial to Mankind; that their Descendents in many pla∣ces degenerating from their Vertues, had given Nations occasion to set up <HI>Aristocracys;</HI> and they also falling into corruption, to institute <HI>Democracys,</HI> or mix'd Governments; did rightly conclude, That every Nation might justly order their own Affairs according to their own pleasure, and could have neither obligation nor reason to set up one man or a few above others, unless it did appear to them that they had more of those Vertues which conduce to the good of Civil Societys, than the rest of their Brethren.</P>
<P>Our Author's cavil upon <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Opinion, <HI>That those who are wise in mind are by nature fitted to be Lords, and those who are strong of body ordain'd to obey,</HI> deserves no answer; for he plainly falsifies the Text. <HI>Aristotle</HI> speaks only of those Qualitys which are requir'd for every purpose; and means no more, than that such as are eminent in the Virtues of the mind deserve to govern, tho they do not excel in bodily strength; and that they who are strong of body, tho of little understanding, and uncapa∣ble of commanding, may be useful in executing the commands of others: But is so far from denying that one man may excel in all the perfections of mind and body, that he acknowledges him only to be a King by nature who dos so, both being requir'd for the full performance of his Duty. And if this be not true, I suppose that one who is like <HI>Agrippa Posthumus, Corporis viribus stolide ferox,</HI> may be fit to govern many Nations; and <HI>Moses</HI> or <HI>Samuel,</HI> if they naturally wanted bodily strength, or that it de∣cay'd by age, might justly be made Slaves, which it a discovery worthy our Author's invention.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Every Man that has Children, has the right of a Father, and is capa∣ble of preferment in a Society compos'd of many.</HEAD>
<P>I Am not concern'd in making good what <HI>Suarez</HI> says: A Jesuit may speak that which is true; but it ought to be receiv'd, as from the Devil, cautiously, lest mischief be hid under it: and Sir <HI>Robert</HI>'s fre∣quent prevarications upon the Scripture, and many good Authors, give reason to suspect he may have falsify'd one, that few Protestants read, if it serv'd to his purpose; and not mentioning the place, his fraud cannot easily be discover'd, unless it be by one who has leisure to examin all his vastly voluminous Writings. But as to the point in question, that pains
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
may be sav'd; there is nothing that can be imputed to the invention of <HI>Suarez;</HI> for, <HI>that</HI> Adam <HI>had only an Oeconomical, not a Political Power,</HI> is not the voice of a Jesuit, but of Nature and common Sense: for Po∣litick signifying no more in Greek, than Civil in Latin; 'tis evident there could be no Civil Power, where there was no Civil Society; and there could be none between him and his Children, because a Civil Society is compos'd of Equals, and fortify'd by mutual compacts, which could not be between him and his Children, at least if there be any thing of truth in our Author's Doctrin, <HI>That all Children do perpetually and absolutely de∣pend upon the Will of their Father. Suarez</HI> seems to have bin of another opinion; and observing the benefits we receive from Parents, and the Ve∣neration we owe to 'em to be reciprocal, he could not think any Duty could extend farther than the knowledg of the Relation upon which it was grounded; and makes a difference between the Power of a Father, before and after his Children are made free; that is in truth, before and after they are able to provide for themselves, and to deliver their Parents from the burden of taking care of them. Which will appear rational to any who are able to distinguish between what a Man of 50 years old, subsisting by himself, and having a Family of his own, or a Child of eight, dos owe to his Father: The same reason that obliges a Child to submit intirely to the Will of his Parents, when he is utterly ignorant of all things, dos per∣mit, and often enjoin men of ripe age to examin the Commands they receive before they obey them; and 'tis not more plain that I owe all manner of duty, affection, and respect to him that did beget and educate me, than that I can owe nothing on any such account to one that did neither.</P>
<P>This may have bin the opinion of <HI>Suarez:</HI> but I can hardly believe such a notion, as, <HI>that</HI> Adam <HI>in process of time might have Servants,</HI> could proceed from any other brain than our Author's: for if he had liv'd to this day, he could have had none under him but his own Children; and if a Family be not compleat without Servants, his must always have bin defective; and his Kingdom must have bin so too, if that has such a re∣semblance to a Family as our Author fancies. This is evident, that a hard Father may use his Children as Servants, or a rebellious, stubborn Son may deserve to be so us'd; and a gentle and good Master may shew that kindness to faithful and well-deserving Servants, which resembles the sweetness of a fatherly rule: but neither of 'em can change their nature; a Son can never grow to be a Servant, nor a Servant to be a Son. If a Family therefore be not compleat, unless it consist of Chil∣dren and Servants, it cannot be like to a Kingdom or City, which is compos'd of Freemen and Equals: Servants may be in it, but are not Members of it. As Truth can never be repugnant to Justice, 'tis impos∣sible this should be a prejudice to the paternal Rule, which is most just; especially when a grateful remembrance of the benefits receiv'd, dos still remain, with a necessary and perpetual obligation of repaying them in all affection and duty: whereas the care of ever providing for their Familys, as they did probably increase in the time of our first long-living Fathers, would have bin an insupportable burden to Parents, if it had bin incum∣bent on 'em. We do not find that <HI>Adam</HI> exercis'd any such power over <HI>Cain,</HI> when he had slain <HI>Abel,</HI> as our Author fancies to be Regal: The Murderer went out, and built a City for himself, and call'd it by the name of his first-born. And we have not the least reson to believe, that after <HI>Adam</HI>'s death <HI>Cain</HI> had any Dominion over his Brethren, or their Posterity; or any one of them over him and his. He fear'd that whoso∣ever
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
 saw him would kill him, which language dos not agree with the Rights belonging to the haughty Title of Heir apparent to the Dominion of the whole Earth. The like was practis'd by <HI>Noah</HI> and his Sons, who set up Colonys for themselves; but liv'd as privat men in obscure places, whilst their Children of the fourth or fifth Generation, especially of the youngest and accursed Son, were great and powerful Kings, as is fully prov'd in the first Chapter.</P>
<P>Tho this had bin otherwise, it would have no effect upon us; for no argument drawn from the examples of <HI>Shem, Ham,</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> if they and their Children had continu'd under the Dominion of <HI>Noah</HI> as long as he liv'd, can oblige me to resign my self and all my concernments abso∣lutely into the hands of one who is not my Father. But when the con∣trary is evidently true in them, and their next ensuing Generations, 'tis an admirable boldness in our Author to think of imposing upon us for an eternal and universal Law (when the knowledg of our first Progenitors is utterly extinguish'd) that which was not at all regarded by those, who could not be ignorant of their own Original, or the Duty thereby incumbent upon them, or their immediate Fathers then living, to whom the Rights must have belong'd, if there had bin any such thing in nature, or that they had bin of any advantage to them: whereas in truth, if there had bin such a Law in the beginning, it must have vanish'd of it self, for want of being exercis'd in the beginning, and could not possibly be reviv'd after four thousand years, when no man in the world can possibly know to whom the universal right of Dominion over the whole World or particular Nations dos belong; for 'tis in vain to speak of a Right, when no one man can have a better Title to it than any other. But there being no precept in the Scripture for it, and the examples directed or ap∣prov'd by God himself and his most faithful Servants, being inconsistent with, and contrary to it, we may be sure there never was any such thing; and that men being left to the free use of their own understanding, may order and dispose of their own Affairs as they think fit: No man can have a better title than another, unless for his personal Vertues; every man that in the judgment of those concern'd excels in them, may be ad∣vanc'd: and those Nations that thro mistake set up such as are unworthy, or do not take right measures in providing for a succession of men worthy, and other things necessary to their welfare, may be guilty of great folly, to their own shame and misery; but can do no injustice to any in rela∣tion to an hereditary Right, which can be naturally in none.</P>

<HEAD> SECT. IV. The Paternal Right devolves to, and is inherited by all the Children.</HEAD>
<P>THO the perversity of our Author's Judgment and Nature may have driven him into the most gross Errors, 'tis not amiss to ob∣serve, that many of those deliver'd by him, proceed from his ignorance of the most important Differences between Father and Lord, King and Tyrant; which are so evident and irreconcilable, that one would have thought no man could be so stupid, as not to see it impossible for one and the same man, at the same time, to be Father and Master, King and Ty∣rant, over the same Persons. But lest he should think me too scrupu∣lous, or too strict in inquiring after Truth, I intend for the present to wave that inquiry, and to seek what was good for <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Noah:</HI> What we have reason to believe they desir'd to transmit to their Posterity, and to take it for a perpetual Law in its utmost extent; which I think will be of no advantage to our Author: for this Authority, which was univer∣sal during their lives, must necessarily after their decease be divided, as an Inheritance, into as many parcels as they had Children. The Apostle <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 19.</NOTE>says, <HI>If Children, then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Christ;</HI> which alluding to the Laws and Customs of Nations, could have bin of no force, unless it had bin true and known to be so. But if Children are Heirs, or joint Heirs, whatsoever Authority <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Noah</HI> had, is inherited by every man in the world; and that title of Heir which our Author so much magnifys, as if annex'd to one single person, vanishes into nothing; or else the words of the Apostle could have neither strength nor truth in them, but would be built upon a false Foundation, which may perhaps agree with our Author's Divinity.</P>
<P>Yet if the Apostle had not declar'd himself so fully in this Point, we might easily have seen that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> did leave their Children in that equality; for Fathers are ever understood to embrace all their Chil∣dren with equal Affection, till the discovery of personal Vertues or Vi∣ces makes a difference. But the personal Vertues, that give a reasonable preference of one before another, or make him more fit to govern than the others, cannot appear before he is, nor can be annex'd to any one Line: Therefore the Father cannot be thought to have given to one Man, or his Descendents, the Government of his Brethren and their Descen∣dents.</P>
<P>Besides, tho the Law of <HI>England</HI> may make one man to be sole Heir of his Father, yet the Laws of God and Nature do not so. All the Children of <HI>Noah</HI> were his Heirs: The Land promis'd to <HI>Abraham, I∣saac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> was equally divided among their Children. If the Chil∣dren of <HI>Joseph</HI> made two Tribes, it was not as the first-born, but by the Will of <HI>Jacob,</HI> who adopted <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Manasseh;</HI> and they thereby became his Sons, and obtain'd an Inheritance equal to that of the other Tribes. The Law allow'd a double Portion to the first begotten; but this made a difference between Brothers only in <HI>proportion,</HI> whereas that between Lord and Servant is in <HI>specie,</HI> not in degree. And if our Au∣thor's Opinion might take place, instead of such a division of the common
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
Inheritance between Brothers, as was made between the Children of <HI>Ja∣cob,</HI> all must continue for ever Slaves to one Lord; which would establish a difference in <HI>specie</HI> between Brethren, which Nature abhors.</P>
<P>If Nature dos not make one man Lord over his Brethren, he can never come to be their Lord, unless they make him so, or he subdue them. If he subdue them, it is an act of Violence, contrary to Right, which may consequently be recover'd: If they make him Lord, 'tis for their own sakes, not for his; and he must seek their good, not his own, lest, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> says, he degenerat from a King into a Tyrant. He therefore who would persuade us, that the Dominion over every Nation dos natu∣rally belong to one Man, Woman or Child, at a venture; or to the Heir, whatsoever he or she be, as to Age, Sex, or other Qualifications, must prove it good for all Nations to be under them. But as Reason is our Nature, that can never be natural to us that is not rational. Reason gives <HI>Paria paribus,</HI> equal Power to those who have equal Abilitys and Merit: It allots to every one the part he is most fit to perform; and this fitness must be equally lasting with the Law that allots it. But as it can never be good for great Nations, having men amongst 'em of Vertue, Expe∣rience, Wisdom and Goodness, to be govern'd by Children, Fools, or vicious and wicked Persons; and we neither find that the Ver∣tues requir'd in such as deserve to govern them, did ever continue in any race of men, nor have reason to believe they ever will, it can never be reasonable to annex the Dominion of a Nation to any one Line. We may take this upon <HI>Solomon</HI>'s word, <HI>Wo to thee, O Land, when thy King</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 10. 16.</NOTE><HI>is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the morning!</HI> And I wish the experience of all Ages did not make this Truth too evident to us. This therefore can never be the Work, much less the Law of Nature; and if there be any such thing in the world, as the Dominion over a Nation inseparably united to a Man and his Family, it can have no other Root than a civil or muni∣cipal Law, which is not the subject of our Discourse.</P>
<P>Moreover, every Father's Right must cease, when he ceases to be; or be transmitted to those, who, being also Fathers, have the same Title to it. And tho the contrary method of annexing the whole Inheritance to one Person, or exposing all his Brethren to be destroy'd by his rage if they will not submit, may conduce to the enlargement of a proud and violent Empire, as in <HI>Turky;</HI> where he that gains the Power, usually begins his Reign with the slaughter of his Brothers and Nephews: yet it can never agree with the piety, gentleness and wisdom of the Patriarchs, or the Laws of God and Nature.</P>
<P>These thing being agreed, we need not trouble our selves with the Li∣mits or Definition of a Family, and as little with the Titles given to the Head of it: 'Tis all one to us, whether it be confin'd to one Roof and Fire, or extended farther; and none but such as are strangers to the pra∣ctice of mankind, can think that titles of Civility have a power to create a right of Dominion. Every man in Latin is call'd <HI>Dominus,</HI> unless such as are of the vilest condition, or in a great subjection to those who speak to them; and yet the word strictly taken, relates only to <HI>Servus,</HI> for a Man is Lord only of his Servant or Slave. The <HI>Italians</HI> are not less li∣beral of the Titles of <HI>Signore</HI> and <HI>Padrone,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Sennor;</HI> but he would be ridiculous in those Countrys, who thereupon should ar∣rogate to himself a right of Dominion over those who are so civil. The vanity of our Age seems to carry this Point a little higher, especially a∣mong the <HI>French,</HI> who put a great weight upon the word <HI>Prince;</HI> but
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
 they cannot change the true signification of it; and even in their sense, <HI>Prince du Sang</HI> signifys no more than a chief Man of the Royal Blood, to whom they pay much respect, because he may come to the Crown; as they at <HI>Rome</HI> do to Cardinals, who have the Power of chu∣sing Popes, and out of whose number, for some Ages, they have bin cho∣sen. In this sense did <HI>Scevola,</HI> when he was apprehended by <HI>Porsenna,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv. l. 2.</NOTE>say, <HI>Trecenti conjuravimus Romanae juventutis Principes;</HI> which was ne∣ver otherwise understood, than of such young Citizens as were remarka∣ble amongst their Companions. And nothing can be more absurd than to think, if the name of Prince had carried an absolute and despotical Power with it, that it could belong to three hundred in a City, that possest no more than a ten miles territory; or that it could have bin given to them, whilst they were young, and the most part of their Fathers, as is most probable, still living.</P>
<P>I should, like our Author, run round in a Circle, if I should refute what he says of a Regal Power in our first Parents; or shew, that the Regal, where it is, is not absolute as often as he dos assert it. But having already prov'd, that <HI>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</HI> &amp;c. enjoy'd no such Power; transmitted to every one of their Sons that which they had, and they became Fathers of many great Nations, who always con∣tinu'd independent on each other; I leave to our Author to prove, when and by what Law the Right of subdividing the Paternal Power was stop'd, and how any one or more of their Descendents came to have that Power over their Brethren, which none of their immediate Children had over theirs.</P>
<P>His question to <HI>Suarez,</HI> how and when Sons become free, favours more of Jesuitical Sophistry, than any thing said by the Jesuit; but the Solu∣tion is easy: for if he mean the respect, veneration and kindness proceed∣ing from gratitude, it ceases only with the Life of the Father to whom it is due, and the memory of it must last as long as that of the Son; and if they had bin possest of such an absolute Power as he fancys, it must have ceas'd with the reasons upon which it was grounded.</P>
<P>First, Because the Power, of which a Father would probably have made a wise and gentle use, could not be rightly trusted in the hands of one who is not a Father; and that which tended only to the preservation of all the Children, could not be turn'd to the increase of the Pride, Luxury and Violence of one, to the oppression of others who are equally Heirs.</P>
<P>In the second place, Societys cannot be instituted, unless the Heads of the Familys that are to compose them, resign so much of their Right as seems convenient into the publick Stock, to which every one becomes sub∣ject: But that the same Power should, at the same time, continue in the true Father, and the figurative Father, the Magistrate; and that the Children should owe intire Obedience to the Commands of both, which may often cross each other, is absurd.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It ceases when it cannot be executed; as when men live to see four or five Generations, as many do at this day; because the Son cannot tell whether he should obey his Father, Grandfather, or Great-Grandfather, and cannot be equally subject to them all; most especially, when they live in divers places, and set up Familys of their own, as the Sons of the Patriarchs did: which being observ'd, I know no place where this Paternal Power could have any effect, unless in the fabulous Island of <HI>Pines;</HI> and even there it must have ceas'd, when he died, who,
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
by the Inventor of the story, is said to have seen above ten thousand Per∣sons issued of his body.</P>
<P>And if it be said, that <HI>Noah, Shem, Abraham,</HI> &amp;c. consented that their Children should go where they thought fit, and provide for themselves; I answer, that the like has bin done in all Ages, and must be done for ever. 'Tis the Voice of Nature, obey'd not only by Mankind, but by all living Creatures; and there is none so stupid as not to understand it. A Hen leaves her Chickens, when they can seek their own nourishment: A Cow looks after her Calf no longer, than till it is able to feed: A Lion gives over hunting for his Whelps, when they are able to seek their own Prey, and have strength enough to provide what is sufficient for them∣selves. And the contrary would be an insupportable burden to all living Creatures, but especially to Men; for the good order that the rational Nature delights in, would be overthrown, and Civil Societys, by which it is best preserv'd, would never be establish'd.</P>
<P>We are not concern'd to examin, Whether the Political and Oecono∣mical Powers be intirely the same, or in what they differ: for that abso∣lute Power which he contends for, is purely despotical, different from both, or rather inconsistent with either as to the same Subject; and that which the Patriarchs exercis'd, having bin equally inherited by their Chil∣dren, and consequently by every one of their Posterity, 'tis as much as is requir'd for my purpose of proving the natural, universal Liberty of Man∣kind; and I am no way concern'd in the Question, Whether the first Pa∣rents of Mankind had a Power of Life and Death over their Children, or not.</P>

<P>THis being establish'd, I shall leave <HI>Filmer</HI> to fight against <HI>Suarez</HI> and <HI>Bellarmin;</HI> or to turn one of them against the other, without any concernment in the Combat, or the success of it. But since he there∣upon raises a Question, <HI>Whether the supreme Power be so in the People, that there is but one and the same Power in all the People of the World; so that no Power can be granted, unless all Men upon the Earth meet, and agree to chuse a Governor:</HI> I think it deserves to be answer'd, and might do it by pro∣posing a Question to him; Whether in his opinion, the Empire of the whole World dos, by the Laws of God and Nature, belong to one Man, and who that Man is? Or, how it came so to be divided, as we have ever known it to have bin, without such an injury to the Universal Mo∣narch, as can never be repair'd? But intending to proceed more candidly, and not to trouble my self with <HI>Bellarmin</HI> or <HI>Suarez,</HI> I say, that they who place the Power in a Multitude, understand a Multitude compos'd of Free∣men, who think it for their convenience to join together, and to establish such Laws and Rules as they oblige themselves to observe: which Mul∣titude, whether it be great or small, has the same Right, because ten Men are as free as ten Millions of Men; and tho it may be more prudent in some cases to join with the greater than the smaller number, because there is more strength, it is not so always: But however, every Man must there∣in
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
 be his own judg, since if he mistake, the hurt is only to himself; and the ten may as justly resolve to live together, frame a Civil Society, and oblige themselves to Laws, as the greatest number of Men that ever met together in the World.</P>
<P>Thus we find that a few Men assembling together upon the Banks of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> resolv'd to build a City, and set up a Government among them∣selves: And the Multitude that met at <HI>Babylon,</HI> when their design of building a Tower that should reach up to Heaven fail'd, and their Lan∣guage was confounded, divided themselves, as our Author says, into se∣venty two parcels, and by the same Right might have divided into more, as their Descendents did into almost an infinite number before the death of their common Father <HI>Noah.</HI> But we cannot find a more perfect Picture of Freemen, living according to their own Will, than in <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot;</HI> they went together into <HI>Canaan,</HI> continu'd together as long as was convenient for them, and parted when their Substance did so increase, that they became troublesom to each other. In the like manner <HI>Ismael, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI>'s six Sons by <HI>Keturah,</HI> might have continu'd together and made one Nation; <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Esau, Moab</HI> and <HI>Ammon,</HI> might have done so too; or all of them that came of the same Stock might have united toge∣ther; but they did not: And their Descendents by the same rule might have subdivided perpetually, if they had thought it expedient for them∣selves: and if the Sons of <HI>Jacob</HI> did not do the like, 'tis probable they were kept together by the hope of an Inheritance promis'd to 'em by God, in which we find no shadow of a despotical Dominion, affected by one as Father or Heir to the first Father, or reputed to be the Heir; but all con∣tinu'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 13.</NOTE>in that fraternal equality, which according to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s words to <HI>Lot</HI> they ought to do. There was no Lord, Slave or Vassal; no strife was to be among them: They were Brethren; they might live together, or separate, as they found it convenient for themselves. By the same Law that <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot, Moab</HI> and <HI>Ammon, Ismael, Isaac,</HI> and the Sons of <HI>Keturah, Jacob, Esau,</HI> and their Descendents, did divide and set up seve∣ral Governments, every one of their Children might have done the like: and the same Right remain'd to their Issue, till they had by agreement engag'd themselves to each other. But if they had no dependence upon each other, and might live together in that fraternal equality which was between <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot;</HI> or separate, and continue in that separation, or reunite; they could not but have a right of framing such conditions of their union as best pleas'd themselves. By this means every number of Men, agreeing together and framing a Society, became a compleat Body, having all Power in themselves over themselves, subject to no other hu∣man Law than their own. All those that compose the Society, being equally free to enter into it or not, no Man could have any Prerogative above others, unless it were granted by the consent of the whole: and nothing obliging them to enter into this Society, but the consideration of their own Good; that Good, or the opinion of it, must have bin the Rule, Motive and End of all that they did ordain. 'Tis lawful therefore for any such Bodys to set up one, or a few Men to govern them, or to re∣tain the Power in themselves; and he or they who are set up, having no other Power but what is so confer'd upon them by that Multitude, whe∣ther great or small, are truly by them made what they are; and by the Law of their own Creation, are to exercise those Powers according to the proportion, and to the ends for which they were given.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="75"/>
These Rights, in several Nations and Ages, have bin variously execu∣ted, in the establishment of <HI>Monarchys, Aristocracys, Democracys,</HI> or <HI>mix'd Governments,</HI> according to the variety of Circumstances; and the Go∣vernments have bin good or evil, according to the rectitude or pravity of their Institution, and the vertue and wisdom, or the folly and vices of those to whom the Power was committed: but the end which was ever propos'd, being the good of the Publick, they only perform'd their duty, who procur'd it according to the Laws of the Society, which were equally valid as to their own Magistrats, whether they were few or many.</P>
<P>This might suffice to answer our Author's Question; but he endeavours further to perplex it, by a fiction of his own brain, <HI>That God gave this Power to the whole Multitude met, and not to every particular Assembly of Men:</HI> And expects a proof, <HI>That the whole Multitude met, and divided this Power which God gave them in gross, by breaking it into parcels, and by ap∣pointing a distinct Power to each Commonwealth.</HI> He also fathers it upon the Assertors of Liberty; <HI>and dos not see,</HI> as he says, <HI>how there can be an Election of a Magistrate by any Commonwealth, that is not an Ʋsurpation upon the Privilege of the whole World, unless all Mankind had met together, and divided the Power into parcels which God had given them in gross.</HI> But be∣fore I put my self to the trouble of answering that which is but an Ap∣pendix to a whimsy of his own, I may justly ask, What hurt he finds in Usurpation, who asserts, that the same Obedience is due to all Monarchs, whether they come in by Inheritance, Election or Usurpation? If Usur∣pation can give a Right to a Monarch, why dos it not confer the same up∣on a People? Or rather, if God did in gross confer such a Right upon all Mankind, and they neither did, nor can meet together by consent to dis∣pose of it for the good of the whole; why should not those who can, and do consent to meet together, agree upon that which seems most expedient to them for the Government of themselves? Did God create Man under the necessity of wanting Government, and all the good that proceeds from it; because at the first all did not, and afterwards all could not meet to agree upon Rules? Or did he ever declare, that unless they should use the first opportunity of dividing themselves into such parcels as were to re∣main unalterable, the right of reigning over every one shall fall to the first Villain that should dare to attempt it? Is it not more consonant to the Wisdom and Goodness of God, to leave to every Nation a liberty of re∣pairing the Mischiefs fallen upon them thro the omission of their first Pa∣rents, by setting up Governments among themselves, than to lay 'em un∣der a necessity of submitting to any that should insolently aspire to a Do∣mination over them? Is it not more just and reasonable to believe, that the universal Right not being executed, devolves upon particular Nations, as Members of the great Body, than that it should become the reward of Violence or Fraud? Or is it possible that any one Man can make himself Lord of a People, or parcel of that Body, to whom God had given the liberty of governing themselves, by any other means than Violence or Fraud, unless they did willingly submit to him? If this Right be not de∣volv'd upon any one Man, is not the invasion of it the most outrageous Injury that can be done to all Mankind, and most particularly to the Na∣tion that is enslav'd by it? Or if the Justice of every Government depends necessarily upon an original Grant, and a Succession certainly deduc'd from our first Fathers, dos not he by his own Principles condemn all the Mo∣narchys of the World, as the most detestable Usurpations, since not one of 'em that we know do any way pretend to it?

 any Power to be just that is not founded upon Consent, may boldly blame Usurpation; is it not an absurd and unpardonable impudence in <HI>Filmer,</HI> to condemn Usurpation in a People, when he has declar'd that the Right and Power of a Father may be gain'd by Usurpation; and that Nations in their Obedience are to regard the Power, not the Means by which it was gain'd? But not to lose more time upon a most frivolous fiction, I affirm, that the Liberty which we contend for is granted by God to every Man in his own Person, in such a manner as may be useful to him and his Poste∣rity, and as it was exercis'd by <HI>Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</HI> &amp;c. and their Children, as has bin prov'd, and not to the vast Body of all Mankind, which never did meet together since the first Age after the Flood, and never could meet to receive any benefit by it.</P>
<P>His next Question deserves scorn and hatred, with all the effects of ei∣ther, if it proceed from malice; tho perhaps he may deserve compassion, if his Crime proceed from ignorance: <HI>Was a general Meeting of a whole Kingdom,</HI> says he, <HI>ever known for the Election of a Prince?</HI> But if there never were any general Meetings of whole Nations, or of such as they did delegate and entrust with the Power of the whole, how did any Man that was elected come to have a Power over the whole? Why may not a People meet to chuse a Prince, as well as any other Magistrate? Why might not the <HI>Athenians, Romans,</HI> or <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> have chosen Princes as well as Archons, Consuls, Dictators or Suffetes, if it had pleas'd them? Who chose all the <HI>Roman</HI> Kings, except <HI>Tarquin</HI> the proud, if the People did not; since their Historys testify, that he was the first who took upon <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv. l. 1.</NOTE>him to reign <HI>sine jussu populi?</HI> Who ever heard of a King of the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> that was not chosen by the Nobility and People? Or, how could they chuse him, if they did not meet in their Persons, or by their De∣putys, which is the same thing, when a People has agreed it should be so? How did the Kings of <HI>Sweden</HI> come by their Power, unless by the like Election, till the Crown was made hereditary, in the time of <HI>Gustavus</HI> the First, as a Reward of his Vertue and Service, in delivering that Country from the Tyranny of the <HI>Danes?</HI> How did <HI>Charles Gustavus</HI> come to be King, unless it was by the Election of the Nobility? He acknowledg'd by the Act of his Election, and upon all occasions, that he had no other right to the Crown than what they had confer'd on him. Did not the like Custom prevail in <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Bohemia,</HI> till those Countrys fell un∣der the Power of the House of <HI>Austria?</HI> and in <HI>Denmark</HI> till the Year 1660? Do not the Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> derive their Authority from this popular Election, which he derides?

<P>Our Author may say, the whole Body of these Nations did not meet at their Elections; tho that is not always true, for in the Infancy of <HI>Rome,</HI> when the whole People dwelt within the Walls of a small City, they did meet for the choice of their Kings, as afterwards for the choice of other

Magistrats. Whilst the <HI>Goths, Franks, Vandals</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> liv'd with∣in the Precincts of a Camp, they frequently met for the Election of a King, and rais'd upon a Target the Person they had chosen: but finding that to be inconvenient, or rather impossible, when they were vastly increas'd in number, and dispers'd over all the Countrys they had conquer'd, no better way was found, than to institute <HI>Gemotes, Parlia∣ments, Diets, Cortez, Assemblys of Estates,</HI> or the like, to do that which formerly had bin perform'd by themselves; and when a People is, by mutual compact, join'd together in a civil Society, there is no difference as to Right, between that which is done by them all in their own Persons, or by some deputed by all, and acting according to the Powers receiv'd from all.</P>
<P>If our Author was ignorant of these things, which are the most com∣mon in all Historys, he might have spar'd the pains of writing upon more abstruse Points; but 'tis a stupendous folly in him, to presume to raise Doctrins depending upon the universal Law of God and Nature, with∣out examining the only Law that ever God did in a publick manner give to Man. If he had look'd into it, he might have learnt, That all <HI>Israel</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 10.</NOTE>was, by the command of God, assembl'd at <HI>Mispeth</HI> to chuse a King, and did chuse <HI>Saul:</HI> He being slain, all <HI>Judah</HI> came to <HI>Hebron,</HI> and made <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 2.</NOTE><HI>David</HI> their King: After the death of <HI>Ishbosheth,</HI> all the Tribes went to <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 5.</NOTE><HI>Hebron,</HI> and anointed him King over them, and he made a Covenant with them before the Lord. When <HI>Solomon</HI> was dead, all <HI>Israel</HI> met to∣gether in <HI>Shechem,</HI> and ten Tribes disliking the proceedings of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 12.</NOTE>rejected him, and made <HI>Jeroboam</HI> their King. The same People in the time of the Judges, had general Assemblys, as often as occasion did re∣quire, to set up a Judg, make War, or the like: And the several Tribes had their Assemblys to treat of Businesses relating to themselves. The Hi∣storys of all Nations, especially of those that have peopled the best parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> are so full of Examples in this kind, that no man can question them, unless he be brutally ignorant, or maliciously contentious. The great matters among the <HI>Germans</HI> were transacted <HI>omnium consensu. De</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit. de mor. Germ.</NOTE><HI>minoribus consultant Principes; de majoribus omnes.</HI> The <HI>Michelgemote</HI> a∣mong the <HI>Saxons</HI> was an Assembly of the whole People: The <HI>Baronagi∣um</HI> is truly said to be the same, in as much as it comprehended all the Freemen, that is, all the People; for the difference between <HI>Civis</HI> and <HI>Servus</HI> is irreconcilable; and no man, whilst he is a Servant, can be a Member of a Commonwealth; for he that is not in his own power, can∣not have a part in the Government of others. All the foremention'd Nor∣thern Nations had the like customs among 'em: The Governments they had were so instituted. The utmost that any now remaining pretends to, is, to derive their right from them: If, according to <HI>Filmer,</HI> these first Assemblys could not confer it upon the first, they had none: Such as claim under 'em, can inherit none from those that had none; and there can be no right in all the Governments we so much venerate; and nothing can tend more to their overthrow than the reception of our Author's Doctrin.</P>
<P>Tho any one Instance would be sufficient to overthrow his general ne∣gative Proposition (for a Rule is not generally true, if there be any just Exception against it) I have alledg'd many, and find it so easy to in∣crease the number, that there is no Nation, whose Original we know, out of whose Historys I will not undertake to produce the like: But I have not bin solicitous precisely to distinguish, which Nations have acted
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
 in their own Persons, and which have made use of Delegats; nor in what times they have chang'd from one way to the other: for if any have act∣ed by themselves, the thing is possible; and whatsoever is done by dele∣gated Powers, must be refer'd to their Principals; for none can give to any a Power which they have not in themselves.</P>
<P>He is graciously pleas'd to confess, That <HI>when Men are assembled by a human Power, that Power that dos assemble them, may also limit the manner of the execution of that Power, &amp;c. But in Assemblys that take their Au∣thority from the Law of Nature, it is not so; for what liberty or freedom is due to any man by the Law of Nature, no inferior Power can alter, limit or diminish: No one man, or multitude of men, can give away the natural Right of another,</HI> &amp;c. These are strong Lines, and such as, if there be any sense in them, utterly overthrow all our Author's Doctrin; for if any Assembly of men did ever take their Authority from the Law of Nature, it must be of such as, remaining in the intire fruition of their natural Liberty, and restrain'd by no Contract, meet together to deliberate of such matters as concern themselves; and if they can be restrnin'd by no one man, or number of men, they may dispose of their own Affairs as they think fit. But because no one of them is oblig'd to enter into the So∣ciety that the rest may constitute, he cannot enjoy the benefit of that So∣ciety unless he enter into it: He may be gone and set up for himself, or set up another with such as will agree with him. But if he enter into the Society, he is oblig'd by the Laws of it; and if one of those Laws be, that all things should be determin'd by the plurality of Voices, his Assent is afterwards comprehended in all the Resolutions of that Plurali∣ty. <HI>Reuben</HI> or <HI>Simeon</HI> might, according to the Laws of Nature, have divided themselves from their Brethren, as well as <HI>Lot</HI> from <HI>Abraham,</HI> or <HI>Ismael</HI> and the Sons of <HI>Keturah</HI> from <HI>Isaac;</HI> but when they, in hopes of having a part in the Inheritance promis'd to their Fathers, had join'd with their Brethren, a few of their Descendents could not have a right, by their dissent, to hinder the Resolutions of the whole Body, or such a part of it as by the first Agreement was to pass for an Act of the whole. And the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 10.</NOTE>Scripture teaches us, that when the Lot was fallen upon <HI>Saul,</HI> they who despis'd him were stil'd <HI>Men of Belial;</HI> and the rest, after his Victory over the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> would have slain 'em if he had permitted. In the like manner, when a number of Men met together to build <HI>Rome,</HI> any man who had dislik'd the design, might justly have refus'd to join in it; but when he had enter'd into the Society, he could not by his Vote invalidate the Acts of the whole, nor destroy the Rights of <HI>Romulus, Numa,</HI> and the others, who by the Senat and People were made Kings; nor those of the other Magistrats, who after their expulsion were legally created.</P>
<P>This is as much as is requir'd to establish the natural Liberty of Man∣kind in its utmost extent, and cannot be shaken by our Author's surmise, <HI>That a Gap is thereby open'd for every seditious multitude to raise a new Com∣monwealth:</HI> For till the Commonwealth be establish'd, no multitude can be seditious, because they are not subject to any human Law; and Sedi∣tion implies an unjust and disorderly opposition of that Power which is legally establish'd; which cannot be when there is none, nor by him who is not a Member of the Society that makes it; and when it is made, such as enter'd into it, are oblig'd to the Laws of it.</P>
<P>This shewing the root and foundation of Civil Powers, we may judg of the use and extent of them, according to the letter of the Law, or the true intentional meaning of it; both which declare them to be purely
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
Human Ordinances, proceeding from the will of those who seek their own good; and may certainly infer, that since all Multitudes are compos'd of such as are under some Contract, or free from all, no Man is oblig'd to enter into those contracts against his own will, nor oblig'd by any to which he dos not assent: Those multitudes that enter into such Contracts, and thereupon form Civil Societys, act according to their own will: Those that are engag'd in none, take their Authority from the Law of Nature; their Rights cannot be limited or diminish'd by any one Man, or number of Men; and consequently whoever dos it, or attempts the doing of it, violates the most sacred Laws of God and Nature.</P>
<P>His cavils concerning Proxys, and the way of using them, deserve no answer, as relating only to one sort of Men amongst us, and can have no influence upon the Laws of Nature, or the proceedings of Assemblys, acting according to such Rules as they set to themselves. In some places they have voted all together in their own persons, as in <HI>Athens:</HI> In others by Tribes, as in <HI>Rome:</HI> Sometimes by Delegats, when the number of the whole People is so great, that no one place can contain them, as in the Parliaments, Diets, General Assemblys of Estates, long us'd in the great Kingdoms of <HI>Europe.</HI> In other Parts many Citys are join'd together in Leagues, as antiently the <HI>Achaians, Etolians, Samnites, Tuscans;</HI> and in these times the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and Cantons of <HI>Switzerland:</HI> but our Author not regarding such matters, in pursuance of his folly, with an ignorance as admirable as his stupidity, repeats his Challenge; <HI>I ask,</HI> says he, <HI>but one Example out of the History of the whole World; let the Common∣wealth be nam'd, wherever the Multitude, or so much as the major part of it, consented either by Voice or Procuration to the Election of a Prince:</HI> not observing, that if an Answer could not be given, he did overthrow the Rights of all the Princes that are, or ever have bin in the World: for if the Liberty of one Man cannot be limited or diminish'd by one, or any number of Men, and none can give away the Right of another; 'tis plain that the Ambition of one Man, or of many, a faction of Citizens, or the mutiny of an Army, cannot give a Right to any over the Libertys of a whole Nation. Those who are so set up, have their root in Violence or Fraud, and are rather to be accounted Robbers and Pirats, than Magi∣strats. <HI>Leo Africanus</HI> observing in his History, that since the extinction <NOTE PLACE="marg">Leonis Afr. Hist. Africae.</NOTE>of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Race (to whom his Countrymen thought God had given the Empire of the World) their Princes did not come in by the consent of those Nations which they govern'd, says, that they are esteem'd Thieves; and that on this account, the most honourable Men among the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> scorn to eat, drink, or make Alliances with them: and if the case were as general as that Author makes it, no better Rule could be any where follow'd by honourable and worthy Men. But a good Cause must not be lost by the fault of an ill Advocate; the Rights of Kings must not perish, because <HI>Filmer</HI> knows not how to defend, or dos maliciously betray them. I have already prov'd that <HI>David,</HI> and di∣vers of the Judges, were chosen by all <HI>Israel; Jeroboam</HI> by ten Tribes; all the Kings of <HI>Rome,</HI> except <HI>Tarquin</HI> the Proud, by the whole City.

If the Power be limited, whatsoever is done according to that limitation, has the same Authority. If it dos there∣fore appear (as is testify'd by the Laws and Historys of all our Northern Nations) that the power of every People is either wholly, or to such a degree as is necessary for creating Kings, granted to their several Gemotes, Diets, Cortez, Assemblys of Estates, Parliaments, and the like; all the Kings that they have any where, or at any time chosen, do reign by the same authority, and have the same right, as if every individual Man of those Nations had assented to their Election. But that these Gemotes, Diets, and other Assemblys of State, have every where had such Powers, and executed them by rejecting or setting up Kings; and that the Kings now in being among us have receiv'd their beginning from such Acts, has bin fully prov'd, and is so plain in it self, that none but those who are grosly stupid or impudent can deny it: which is enough to shew that all Kings are not set up by violence, deceit, faction of a few powerful Men, or the mutinys of Armys; but from the consent of such multitudes, as joining together, frame Civil Societys; and either in their own Persons at general Assemblys, or by their Delegats, confer a just and legal Power upon them; which our Author rejecting, he dos, as far as in him lies, prove them all to be Usurpers and Tyrants.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. They who have a right of chusing a King, have the right of making a King.</HEAD>
<P>THO the Right of Magistrats dos essentially depend upon the con∣sent of those they govern, it is hardly worth our pains to examin, <HI>Whether the silent acceptation of a Governor by part of the People be an argu∣ment of their concurring in the election of him; or by the same reason the tacit consent of the whole Commonwealth may be maintain'd:</HI> for when the question is concerning Right, fraudulent surmises are of no value; much less will it from thence follow, <HI>that a Prince commanding by Succession, Conquest, or Ʋsurpation, may be said to be elected by the People;</HI> for evident marks of dissent are often given: Some declare their hatred; others murmur more privatly; many oppose the Governour or Government, and succeed ac∣cording to the measure of their Strength, Virtue, or Fortune. Many would resist, but cannot; and it were ridiculous to say, that the Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Greece,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> or Dutchy of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> do tacitly assent to the Government of the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or Duke of <HI>Florence;</HI> when nothing is more certain than that those miserable Nations abhor the Tyrannys they are under; and if they were not master'd by a Power much too great for them, they would soon free themselves. And they who are under such Governments do no more assent to them, tho they may be silent, than a Man approves of being robb'd, when, with∣out saying a word, he delivers his Purse to a Thief that he knows to be too strong for him.</P>
<P>'Tis not therefore the bare sufferance of a Government when a disgust is declar'd, nor a silent submission when the power of opposing is wan∣ting, that can imply an Assent, or Election, and create a Right; but an explicit act of Approbation, when Men have ability and courage to resist or deny. Which being agreed, 'tis evident that our Author's distinction between <HI>eligere</HI> and <HI>instituere</HI> signifys nothing: tho, if the power of insti∣tuting were only left to Nations, it would be sufficient; for he is in vain elected who is not instituted; and he that is instituted is certainly elected, for his Institution is an Election. As the <HI>Romans</HI> who chose <HI>Romulus, Numa,</HI> and <HI>Hostilius</HI> to be Kings; and <HI>Brutus, Valerius,</HI> or <HI>Lucretius</HI> to be Consuls; did make them so, and their Right was solely grounded up∣on their Election. The Text brought by our Author against this dos fully prove it, <HI>Him shalt thou set King over thee whom the Lord shall chuse;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE>for God did not only make the institution of a King to be purely an act of the People, but left it to them to institute one or not, as should best please themselves: and the words, <HI>whom the Lord shall chuse,</HI> can have no other signification, than that the People resolving to have a King, and follow∣ing the Rules prescrib'd by his Servant <HI>Moses,</HI> he would direct 'em in their choice; which relates only to that particular People in covenant with God, and immediately under his Government, which no other was. But this pains might have bin sav'd, if God by a universal Law had given a rule to all. The <HI>Israelites</HI> could not have bin three hundred years with∣out a King, and then left to the liberty of making one, or not, if he by a perpetual Law had ordain'd that every Nation should have one; and it
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
 had bin as well impertinent as unjust to deliberate who should be King, if the Dominion had by right of Inheritance belong'd to one: They must have submitted to him whether they would or not: No care was to be taken in the election or institution of him, who by his birth had a Right annex'd to his Person that could not be alter'd: He could not have bin forbidden <HI>to multiply Silver or Gold,</HI> who by the Law of his Creation might do what he pleas'd: It had bin ridiculous to say, <HI>he should not raise his Heart above his Brethren,</HI> who had no Brethren, that is, no Equals; but was rais'd above all by God, who had impos'd upon all others a ne∣cessity of obeying him. But God, who dos nothing in vain, did neither constitute or elect any till they desir'd it, nor command 'em to do it them∣selves, unless it so pleas'd themselves; nor appoint 'em to take him out of any one Line: Every <HI>Israelite</HI> might be chosen: None but Strangers were excluded; and the People were left to the liberty of chusing and in∣stituting any one of their Brethren.</P>
<P>Our Author endeavouring by <HI>Hooker</HI>'s authority to establish his distin∣ction between <HI>eligere</HI> and <HI>instituere,</HI> destroys it, and the paternal Right, which he makes the foundation of his Doctrine. <HI>Heaps of Scripture are alledg'd,</HI> says he, <HI>concerning the solemn Coronation and Inauguration of</HI> Saul, David, Solomon <HI>and others, by Nobles, Antients, and People of the Com∣monwealth of</HI> Israel: which is enough to prove that the whole work was theirs; that no other had any title more than what they bestow'd upon him; that the Kings were set up by the Nobles, Antients and People: Even God did no otherwise intervene than by such a secret disposition of the Lots by his Providence, as is exercis'd in the Government of all the things in the World; and we cannot have a more certain evidence, that a paternal right to Dominion is a mere Whimsy, than that God did not cause the Lot to fall upon the eldest, of the eldest Line, of the eldest Tribe; but upon <HI>Saul,</HI> a young Man, of the youngest Tribe: and after∣wards, tho he had design'd <HI>David, Solomon, Jerobvam,</HI> and others, who had no pretence to the paternal Right, to be Kings, he left both the election and institution of them to the Elders and People.</P>
<P><HI>But</HI> Hooker <HI>being well examin'd, it will appear that his opinions are as contrary to the Doctrin of our Author, as those we have mention'd out</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hooker</HI> Eccl. Pol. l. 1. c. 10.</NOTE><HI>of</HI> Plato <HI>and</HI> Aristotle. <HI>He plainly says,</HI> It is impossible that any should have a compleat lawful power over a multitude consisting of so many Familys, as eve∣ry politick Society dos, but by consent of Men, or immediate appointment from God: Because not having the natural Superiority of Fathers, their Power must needs be usurp'd, and then unlawful; or if lawful, then either granted or con∣sented to by them over whom they exercise the same, or else given extraordina∣rily by God. <HI>And tho he thinks Kings to have bin the first Governors so constituted, he adds,</HI> That this is not the only Regiment that has bin receiv'd in the World. The inconveniences of one kind have caus'd sundry others to be devis'd. So that in a word, all publick Regiment, of what kind soever, seems evidently to have risen from deliberate advice, consultation and composi∣tion between Men, judging it convenient and behoofeful. <HI>And a little below,</HI> Man's Nature standing therefore as it doth, some kind of regiment the Law of Nature dos require; yet the kinds thereof being many, Nature ties not to any one, but leaves the choice as a thing arbitrary. <HI>And again,</HI> To live by one Man's will, became all Mens misery: This constrain'd them to come unto Laws, &amp;c. But as those Laws do not only teach that which is good, but enjoin it, they have in them a constraining force. To constrain Men to any thing inconve∣nient seems unreasonable: Most requisite therefore it is that to devise Laws,
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
which all Men should be forc'd to obey, none but wise Men should be admitted. Moreover that which we say concerning the power of Government, must here be apply'd to the power of making Laws, whereby to govern; which Power God has over all; and by the natural Law, whereunto he has made all subject, the lawful power of making Laws to command whole politick Societys of men, belongs so properly to the same intire Societys, that for any Prince or Poten∣tate, of what kind soever upon Earth, to exercise the same of himself, and not either by express commission immediately from God, or else by authority de∣riv'd at the first from their consent, upon whose persons they impose Laws, it is no better than mere Tyranny. Laws therefore they are not, which publick consent has not made so. <HI>The humour of our Age consider'd, I should not have ventur'd to say so much: But if</HI> Hooker <HI>be a Man of such great Au∣thority, I cannot offend in transcribing his words, and shewing how vilely he is abus'd by</HI> Filmer; <HI>concluding, that if he be in the right, the choice and constitution of Government, the making of Laws, Coro∣nation, Inauguration, and all that belongs to the chusing and making of Kings, or other Magistrats, is merely from the People; and that all Power exercis'd over them, which is not so, is Usurpation and Tyranny, unless it be by an immediate Commission from God; which if any man has, let him give testimony of it, and I will confess he comes not within the reach of our reasonings, but ought to be obey'd by those to whom he is sent, or over whom he is plac'd.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless our Author is of another opinion; but scorning to give us a reason, he adds to <HI>Hooker</HI>'s words, <HI>As if these Solemnitys were a kind of deed, whereby the right of Dominion is given; which strange, untrue, and unnatural Conceits are set abroad by Seedsmen of Rebellion:</HI> And a little farther, <HI>Ʋnless we will openly proclaim defiance to all Law, Equity, and Reason, we must say (for there is no remedy) that in Kingdoms hereditary, Birthright giveth a Right to Sovereign Dominion, &amp;c. Those Solemnitys do either serve for an open testification of the Inheritor's Right, or belong to the form of inducing him into the possession.</HI> These are bold Censures, and do not only reach Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> whose modesty and peaceableness of spirit is no less esteem'd than his Learning; but the Scriptures also, and the best of human Authors, upon which he founded his Opinions. But why should it be thought a strange, untrue, or unnatural Conceit, to believe that when the Scriptures say <HI>Nimrod</HI> was the first that grew powerful in the Earth, long before the death of his Fathers, and could consequently nei∣ther have a right of Dominion over the Multitude met together at <HI>Baby∣lon,</HI> nor subdue them by his own strength, he was set up by their Con∣sent; or that they who made him their Governor, might prescribe Rules by which he should govern? Nothing seems to me less strange, than that a multitude of reasonable Creatures, in the performance of Acts of the greatest importance, should consider why they do them. And the infinite variety which is observ'd in the constitution, mixture, and regu∣lation of Governments, dos not only shew that the several Nations of the World have consider'd them; but clearly prove that all Nations have perpetually continu'd in the exercise of that Right. Nothing is more natural than to follow the voice of Mankind: The wisest and best have ever employ'd their studys in forming Kingdoms and Commonwealths, or in adding to the perfections of such as were already constituted; which had bin contrary to the Laws of God and Nature, if a general Rule had bin set, that had oblig'd all to be for ever subject to the Will of one; and they had not bin the best, but the worst of men who had departed
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
 from it. Nay, I may say, that the Law given by God to his peculiar People, and the Commands deliver'd by his Servants in order to it, or the prosecution of it, had bin contrary to his own eternal and universal Law; which is impossible. A Law therefore having bin given by God, which had no relation to, or consistency with the absolute paternal pow∣er; Judges and Kings created, who had no pretence to any preference before their Brethren, till they were created, and commanded not to raise their Hearts above them when they should be created; the Wisdom and Vertue of the best men in all ages shewn in the constitution or reforma∣tion of Governments; and Nations in variously framing them, preserv∣ing the possession of their natural Right, to be govern'd by none, and in no other way than they should appoint: The opinions of <HI>Hooker, That all publick Regiment, of what kind soever, arises from the deliberate advice of men seeking their own good, and that all other is mere Tyranny;</HI> are not <HI>untrue and unnatural conceits set abroad</HI> by the <HI>Seedsmen of Rebellion,</HI> but real Truths grounded upon the Laws of God and Nature, acknowledg'd and practis'd by Mankind. And no Nation being justly subject to any but such as they set up, nor in any other manner than according to such Laws as they ordain, the right of chusing and making those that are to govern them, must wholly depend upon their Will.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. The Laws of every Nation are the measure of Magistratical Power.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author lays much weight upon the word <HI>Hereditary:</HI> but the question is, What is inherited in an Hereditary Kingdom, and how it comes to be hereditary? 'Tis in vain to say <HI>the Kingdom;</HI> for we do not know what he means by the Kingdom: 'tis one thing in one place, and very different in others; and I think it not easy to find two in the World that in power are exactly the same. If he understands all that is comprehended within the precincts over which it reaches, I deny that any such is to be found in the World: If he refers to what preceding Kings enjoy'd, no determination can be made, till the first original of that Kingdom be examin'd, that it may be known what that first King had, and from whence he had it.</P>
<P>If this variety be denied, I desire to know whether the Kings of <HI>Spar∣ta</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI> had the same power over their Subjects; if the same, whe∣ther both were absolute, or both limited; if limited, how came the De∣crees of the <HI>Persian</HI> Kings to pass for Laws? If absolute, how could the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings be subject to Fines, Imprisonment, or the sentence of Death; and not to have power to send for their own Supper out of the Common Hall? Why did <HI>Xenophon</HI> call <HI>Agesilaus</HI> a good and faithful King, obedient to the Laws of his Country, when, upon the command of the <HI>Ephori,</HI> he left the War that he had with so much glory begun in <HI>Asia,</HI> if he was subject to none? How came the <HI>Ephori</HI> to be establish'd to restrain the Power of Kings, if it could no way be restrain'd, if all ow'd obedience to them, and they to none? Why did <HI>Theopompus</HI> his Wife reprove him for suffering his power to be diminish'd by their crea∣tion, if it could not be diminish'd? Or why did he say he had made the
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
Power more permanent in making it lefs odious, if it was perpetual and unalterable? We may go farther, and taking <HI>Xenophon</HI> and <HI>Plutarch</HI> for our guides, assert that the Kings of <HI>Sparta</HI> never had the powers of War or Peace, Life and Death, which our Author esteems inseparable from Regality, and conclude either that no King has them, or that all Kings are not alike in power. If they are not in all places the same, Kings do not reign by an universal Law, but by the particular Laws of each Coun∣try; which give to every one so much power, as in the opinion of the givers conduces to the end of their Institution, which is the publick good.</P>
<P>It may be also worth our inquiry how this inherited Power came to be hereditary. We know that the Sons of <HI>Vespasian</HI> and <HI>Constantine</HI> inheri∣ted the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, tho their Fathers had no such title: But having gain'd the Empire by violence, which <HI>Hooker</HI> says is mere Tyranny that can create no right, they could devolve none to their Children. The Kings of <HI>France</HI> of the three Races have inherited the Crown; but <HI>Me∣roveus, Pepin,</HI> and <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> could neither pretend title nor conquest, or any other Right than what was confer'd upon them by the Clergy, Nobili∣ty, and People; and consequently whatsoever is inherited from them can have no other Original; for that is the gift of the People which is be∣stow'd upon the first, under whom the Successors claim, as if it had bin by a peculiar Act given to every one of them. It will be more hard to shew how the Crown of <HI>England</HI> is become hereditary, unless it be by the Will of the People; for tho it were granted that some of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings came in by inheritance (which I do not, having, as I think, prov'd them to have bin absolutely elective) yet <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI> did not, for he was a Bastard, and could inherit nothing. <HI>William Rufus</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> did not; for their Elder Brother <HI>Robert</HI> by right of Inheritance ought to have bin prefer'd before 'em: <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the second did not; for <HI>Maud</HI> the only Heiress of <HI>Henry</HI> the first was living when both were crown'd: <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>John</HI> did not, for they were Bastards born in a∣dultery. They must therefore have receiv'd their Right from the Peo∣ple, or they could have none at all; and their Successors fall under the same condition.</P>
<P>Moreover, I find great variety in the deduction of this hereditary Right. In <HI>Sparta</HI> there were two Kings of different Familys, endow'd with an equal power. If the <HI>Heraclidae</HI> did reign as Fathers of the Peo∣ple, the <HI>Aeacidae</HI> did not: if the right was in the <HI>Aeacidae,</HI> the <HI>Heraclidae</HI> could have none; for 'tis equally impossible to have two Fathers as two thousand. 'Tis in vain to say that two Familys join'd, and agreed to reign jointly: for 'tis evident the <HI>Spartans</HI> had Kings before the time of <HI>Hercules</HI> or <HI>Achilles,</HI> who were the Fathers of the two Races. If it be said that the Regal power with which they were invested did entitle 'em to the right of Fathers, it must in like manner have belong'd to the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Consuls, Military Tribunes, Dictators and Pretors; for they had more Power than the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings; and that glorious Nation might change their Fathers every year, and multiply or diminish the number of 'em as they pleas'd. If this be most ridiculous and absurd, 'tis certain that the Name and Office of King, Consul, Dictator, or the like, dos not confer any determin'd Right upon the Person that has it: Every one has a right to that which is allotted to him by the Laws of the Country by which be is created.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="86"/>
 As the <HI>Persians, Spartans, Romans</HI> or <HI>Germans,</HI> might make such Ma∣gistrats, and under such names as best pleas'd themselves, and accord∣ingly enlarge or diminish their Power; the same Right belongs to all Na∣tions, and the Rights due unto, as well as the Dutys incumbent upon eve∣ry one, are to be known only by the Laws of that place. This may seem strange to those who know neither Books nor Things, Historys nor Laws; but is well explain'd by <HI>Grotius,</HI> who denying the Sovereign Power to be annex'd to any Name, speaks of divers Magistrats under several names that had, and others that under the same names had it not; and distin∣guishes <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grot. de Jur. bel. &amp; pac. l. 1. c. 1.</NOTE>those who have the <HI>Summum Imperium summo modo,</HI> from those who have it <HI>modo non summo:</HI> and tho probably he look'd on the first sort as a thing merely speculative, if by that <HI>summo modo,</HI> a right of do∣ing what one pleases be understood; yet he gives many Examples of the other. Among those who had <HI>liberrimum imperium,</HI> if any had it, he names the Kings of the <HI>Sabeans;</HI> who nevertheless were under such a condition, that tho they were, as <HI>Agatharchidas</HI> reports, obey'd in all things, whilst they continu'd within the Walls of their Palace, might be ston'd by any that met 'em without it. He finds also another Obstacle to the Absolute power, <HI>Cum Rex partem habeat summi Imperii, partem Senatus, sive Populus;</HI> which parts are proportion'd according to the Laws of each Kingdom, whether Hereditary or Elective, both being equally regulated by them.</P>
<P>The Law that gives and measures the Power, prescribes Rules how it should be transmitted. In some places the supreme Magistrats are annu∣ally elected, in others their Power is for life; in some they are merely elective, in others hereditary under certain Rules or Limitations. The antient Kingdoms and Lordships of <HI>Spain</HI> were hereditary; but the Suc∣cession went ordinarily to the eldest of the reigning Family, not to the nearest in Blood. This was the ground of the Quarrel between <HI>Corbis</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv. l. 28.</NOTE>the Brother, and <HI>Orsua</HI> the Son of the last Prince, decided by combat be∣fore <HI>Scipio.</HI> I know not whether the <HI>Goths</HI> brought that custom with 'em when they conquer'd <HI>Spain,</HI> or whether they learnt it from the In∣habitants; but certain it is, that keeping themselves to the Familys of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saavedra coro∣na Gothica.</NOTE>the <HI>Balthei,</HI> and <HI>Amalthei,</HI> they had more regard to Age than Proximity; and almost ever prefer'd the Brother, or eldest Kinsman of the last King <NOTE PLACE="marg">Marian. Hist. Hispan.</NOTE>before his Son. The like custom was in use among the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> who according to the several Changes that happen'd among the Familys of <HI>Almohades, Almoranides,</HI> and <HI>Benemerini,</HI> did always take one of the reigning Blood; but in the choice of him had most respect to Age and Capacity. This is usually call'd the Law of <HI>Thanestry;</HI> and, as in many other places, prevail'd also in <HI>Ireland,</HI> till that Country fell under the <HI>English</HI> Government.</P>
<P>In <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> the Male that is nearest in Blood, succeeds; and I do not know of any deviation from that Rule in <HI>France,</HI> since <HI>Henry</HI> the First was prefer'd before <HI>Robert</HI> his elder Brother, Grandchild to <HI>Hugh Capet:</HI> But notwithstanding the great veneration they have for the Royal Blood, they utterly exclude Females, lest the Crown should fall to a Stranger; or a Woman that is seldom able to govern her self, should come to govern so great a People. Some Nations admit Females, either simply, as well as Males; or under a condition of not marrying out of their Country, or without the consent of the Estates, with an absolute exclusion of them and their Children if they do; according to which Law, now in force among the <HI>Swedes, Charles Gustavus</HI> was chosen King
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
upon the resignation of Queen <HI>Christina,</HI> as having no Title; and the Crown setled upon the Heirs of his Body, to the utter exclusion of his Brother <HI>Adolphus,</HI> their Mother having married a <HI>German.</HI> Tho divers Nations have differently dispos'd their Affairs; all those that are not na∣turally Slaves, and like to Beasts, have prefer'd their own Good before the personal Interests of him that expects the Crown, so as upon no pre∣tence whatever to admit of one who is evidently guilty of such Vices as are prejudicial to the State. For this reason the <HI>French,</HI> tho much ad∣dicted to their Kings, rejected the vile remainders of <HI>Meroveus</HI> his Race, and made <HI>Pepin</HI> the Son of <HI>Charles Martel</HI> King: And when his Descen∣dents fell into the like Vices, they were often depos'd, till at last they were wholly rejected, and the Crown given to <HI>Capet</HI> and to his Heirs Male as formerly. Yet for all this <HI>Henry</HI> his Grandchild, being esteem'd more fit to govern than his elder Brother <HI>Robert,</HI> was, as is said before, made King, and that Crown still remains in his Descendents; no consi∣deration being had of the Children of <HI>Robert,</HI> who continu'd Dukes of <HI>Burgundy</HI> during the reigns of ten Kings. And in the memory of our Fa∣thers, <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Navarr</HI> was rejected by two Assemblys of the Estates, because he differ'd in Religion from the Body of the Nation, and could never be receiv'd as King, till he had renounc'd his own, tho he was cer∣tainly the next in Blood; and that in all other respects he excel'd in those Vertues which they most esteem.</P>
<P>We have already prov'd, that our own History is full of the like Ex∣amples, and might enumerate a multitude of others, if it were not too tedious: and as the various Rules, according to which all the hereditary Crowns of the World are inherited, shew, that none is set by Nature, but that every People proceeds according to their own Will; the fre∣quent deviations from those Rules do evidently testify, that <HI>Salus Populi est Lex suprema;</HI> and that no Crown is granted otherwise, than in sub∣mission to it.</P>
<P>But tho there were a Rule, which in no case ought to be transgrest, there must be a Power of judging to whom it ought to be applied. 'Tis perhaps hard to conceive one more precise than that of <HI>France,</HI> where the eldest Legitimate Male in the direct Line is prefer'd; and yet that alone is not sufficient. There may be Bastardy in the case: Bastards may be thought legitimate, and legitimate Sons Bastards. The Children born of <HI>Isabel</HI> of <HI>Portugal</HI> during her Marriage with <HI>John</HI> the Third of <HI>Castile</HI> were declar'd Bastards; and the Title of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> to that Crown, depends upon that Declaration. We often see that Marriages which have bin contracted, and for a long time taken to be good, have bin declar'd null; and the legitimation of the present King of <HI>France</HI> is founded solely upon the abolition of the Marriage of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth with <HI>Marguerite</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> which for the space of twenty seven Years was thought to have bin good. Whilst <HI>Spain</HI> was divided into five or six Kingdoms, and the several Kings link'd to each other by mutual Allian∣ces, incestuous Marriages were often contracted, and upon better consi∣deration annul'd; many have bin utterly void, thro the preingagement of one of the Partys. These are not feign'd Cases, but such as happen frequently; and the diversity of Accidents, as well as the humours of Men, may produce many others, which would involve Nations in the most fatal Disorders, if every one should think himself oblig'd to follow such a one who pretended a Title, that to him might seem plausible, when another should set up one as pleasing to others, and there were no Power
<PB N="80" REF="88"/>
 to terminate those Disputes to which both must submit, but the decision must be left to the Sword.</P>
<P>This is that which I call the Application of the Rule, when it is as plain and certain as human Wisdom can make it; but if it be left more at large, as where Females inherit, the difficultys are inextricable: and he that says, the next Heir is really King when one is dead, before he be so declar'd by a Power that may judg of his Title, dos, as far as in him lies, expose Nations to be split into the most desperate Factions, and every man to fight for the Title which he fancies to be good, till he destroy those of the contrary Party, or be destroy'd by them. This is the blessed way propos'd by our Author to prevent Sedition: But, God be thank'd, our Ancestors found a better. They did not look upon <HI>Robert</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI> as King of <HI>England</HI> after the death of his Father; and when he did proudly endeavour, on pretence of Inheritance, to impose himself upon the Nation, that thought fit to prefer his younger Brothers before him, he paid the penalty of his folly, by the loss of his Eyes and Liberty. The <HI>French</HI> did not think the Grandchild of <HI>Pharamond</HI> to be King after the death of his Father, nor seek who was the next Heir of the <HI>Merovin∣gian</HI> Line, when <HI>Chilperic</HI> the Third was dead; nor regard the Title of <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> after the death of his Brother <HI>Lothair,</HI> or of <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Burgundy</HI> eldest Son of King <HI>Robert;</HI> but advanc'd <HI>Meroveus, Pepin, Ca∣pet</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the First, who had no other Right than what the Nobility and People bestow'd upon them. And if such Acts do not destroy the Pretences of all who lay claim to Crowns by Inheritance, and do not create a Right, I think it will be hard to find a lawful King in the world, or that there ever has bin any; since the first did plainly come in like <HI>Nimrod,</HI> and those who have bin every where since Historys are known to us, ow'd their exaltation to the Consent of Nations, arm'd or unarm'd, by the deposition or exclusion of the Heirs of such as had reign'd before them.</P>
<P>Our Author not troubling himself with these things, or any other re∣lating to the matter in question, is pleas'd to slight <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Opinions concerning Coronation and Inauguration, with <HI>the heaps of Scripture</HI> up∣on which he grounds them; whereas those Solemnitys would not only have bin foolish and impertinent, but profane and impious, if they were not Deeds by which the Right of Dominion is really confer'd. What could be more wickedly superstitious, than to call all <HI>Israel</HI> together be∣fore the Lord, and to cast Lots upon every Tribe, Family and Person, for the election of a King, if it had bin known to whom the Crown did belong by a natural and unalterable Right? Or if there had bin such a thing in Nature, how could God have caus'd that Lot to fall upon one of the youngest Tribe, for ever to discountenance his own Law, and divert Nations from taking any notice of it? It had bin absurd for the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> to chuse and anoint <HI>David,</HI> and for the other Tribes to follow their example after the death of <HI>Ishbosheth,</HI> if he had bin King by a Right not depending on their Will. <HI>David</HI> did worse in slaying the Sons of <HI>Rim∣mon,</HI> saying, they had kill'd a righteous Man lying upon his bed, if <HI>Ish∣bosheth,</HI> whose Head they presented, had most unrighteously detain'd from him, as long as he liv'd, the Dominion of the ten Tribes: The King, Elders and People, had most scornfully abus'd the most sacred things, by using such Ceremonys in making him King, and com∣pleating their Work in a Covenant made between him and them before the Lord, if he had bin already King, and if those Acts
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
had bin empty Ceremonys conferring no Right at all. </P>
<P>I dare not say that a League dos imply an absolute equality between both Partys; for there is a <HI>Foedus inequale,</HI> wherein the weaker, as <HI>Groti∣us</HI> says, dos usually obtain protection, and the stronger honour; but there can be none at all, unless both Partys are equally free to make it, or not to make it. <HI>David</HI> therefore was not King, till he was elected, and those Covenants made; and he was made King by that Election and Covenants.</P>
<P>This is not shaken by our Author's Supposition, <HI>That the People would not have taken</HI> Joas, Manasseh <HI>or</HI> Josiah, <HI>if they had had a right of chusing a King; since</HI> Solomon <HI>says, Wo unto the Kingdom whose King is a Child!</HI> For, first, they who at the first had a right of chusing whom they pleas'd to be King, by the Covenant made with him whom they did chuse, may have depriv'd themselves of the farther execution of it, and render'd the Crown hereditary even to Children, unless the Conditions come to be violated upon which it was granted. In the second place, if the Infancy of a King brings Wo upon a People, the Government of such a one can∣not be according to the Laws of God and Nature; for Governments are not instituted by either for the pleasure of a Man, but for the good of Nations; and their Weal, not their Wo, is sought by both: And if Children are any where admitted to rule, 'tis by the particular Law of the place, grounded perhaps upon an opinion, that it is the best way to prevent dangerous Contests; or that other ways may be found to prevent the Inconveniences that may proceed from their weakness. Thirdly, It cannot be concluded that they might not reject Children, because they did not: Such matters require positive Proofs, Suppositions are of no value in relation to them, and the whole matter may be alter'd by par∣ticular Circumstances. The <HI>Jews</HI> might reasonably have a great venera∣tion for the House of <HI>David:</HI> they knew what was promis'd to that Family; and whatever respect was paid, or privilege granted on that ac∣count, can be of no advantage to any other in the world. They might be farther induc'd to set up <HI>Joas,</HI> in hope the defects of his Age might be supplied by the Vertue, Experience and Wisdom of <HI>Jehoiada.</HI> We do not know what good opinion may have bin conceiv'd of <HI>Manasseh</HI> when he was twelve years old; but much might be hop'd from one that had bin virtuously educated, and was probably under the care of such as had bin chosen by <HI>Hezekiah:</HI> and tho the contrary did fall out, the mischiefs brought upon the People by his wicked Reign, proceeded not from the weakness of his Childhood, but from the malice of his riper Years. And both the Examples of <HI>Joas</HI> and <HI>Josiah</HI> prove, that neither of 'em came in by their own right, but by the choice of the People. Jehoiada <HI>gather'd the</HI> Levites <HI>out of all the Citys of</HI> Judah, <HI>and the chief of the Fa∣thers</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 23.</NOTE><HI>of</HI> Israel, <HI>and they came to</HI> Jerusalem: <HI>And all the Congregation made a Covenant with the King in the House of God, and brought out the King's Son, and put upon him the Crown, and gave him the Testimony, and made him King;</HI> whereupon they slew <HI>Athaliah. And when</HI> Ammon <HI>was slain,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 33.</NOTE><HI>the people of the Land slew them that had conspir'd against King</HI> Ammon; <HI>and the people of the Land made</HI> Josiah <HI>his Son King in his stead:</HI> which had bin most impertinent, if he was of himself King before they made him so. Besides, tho Infancy may be a just cause of excepting against, and rejecting the next Heir to a Crown, 'tis not the greatest or strongest. 'Tis far more easy to find a Remedy against the folly of a Child (if the State be well regulated) than the more rooted Vices of grown men.

 The <HI>English,</HI> who willingly receiv'd <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, <HI>Edward</HI> the Fifth and Sixth, tho Children, resolutely oppos'd <HI>Robert</HI> the <HI>Norman:</HI> And the <HI>French,</HI> who willingly submitted to <HI>Charles</HI> the Ninth, <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thir∣teenth and Fourteenth in their Infancy, rejected the rude remainders of <HI>Meroveus</HI> his Race, <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> with his Kindred descended from <HI>Pepin, Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> with his Descendents, and <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Navarr,</HI> till he had satisfy'd the Nobility and People in the point of Reli∣gion.

<P>Lastly, Tho the practice of one or more Nations may indicate what Laws, Covenants or Customs were in force among them, yet they can∣not bind others: The diversity of them proceeds from the variety of mens Judgments, and declares, that the direction of all such Affairs depends up∣on their own Will; according to which every People for themselves do form and measure the Magistracy, and magistratical Power; which, as it is directed solely for the good, has its exercises and extent proportiona∣ble to the Command of those that institute it; and such Ordinances being good for men, God makes them his own.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. There is no natural propensity in Man or Beast to Monarchy.</HEAD>
<P>I SEE no reason to believe that God did approve the Government of one over many, because he created but one: but to the contrary, in as much he did endow him, and those that came from him, as well the youngest as the eldest Line, with understanding to provide for themselves, and by the invention of Arts and Sciences to be beneficial to each other; he shew'd, that they ought to make use of that understanding in forming Governments according to their own convenience, and such occasions as should arise, as well as in other matters. And it might as well be infer'd, that it is unlawful for us to build, clothe, arm, defend, or nourish our selves, otherwise than our first Parents did, before or soon after the Flood, as to take from us the liberty of instituting Governments that were not known to them. If they did not find out all that conduces to the use of man, but a Faculty as well as a Liberty was left to every one, and will be to the end of the World, to make use of his Wit, Industry, and Ex∣perience, according to present Exigences, to invent and practise such things as seem convenient to himself and others in matters of the least impor∣tance; it were absurd to imagin, that the political Science, which of all
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
others is the most abstruse and variable according to Accidents and Cir∣cumstances, should have bin perfectly known to them who had no use of it; and that their Descendents are oblig'd to add nothing to what they practis'd. But the reason given by our Author to prove this extravagant fancy, is yet more ridiculous than the thing it self; <HI>God,</HI> says he, <HI>shew'd his opinion,</HI> viz. that all should be govern'd by one, <HI>when he endow'd not only Men, but Beasts with a natural propensity to Monarchy: Neither can it be doubted, but a natural propensity is refer'd to God who is the Author of Nature:</HI> Which I suppose may appear if it be consider'd.</P>
<P>Nevertheless I cannot but commend him in the first place for intro∣ducing God speaking so modestly, not declaring his Will, but his Opi∣nion. He puts haughty and majestick Language into the mouth of Kings. They command and decide, as if they were subject to no Error, and their Will ought to be taken for perpetual Laws; but to God he ascribes an humble delivery of his Opinion only, as if he fear'd to be mistaken. In the second place, I deny that there is any such general propensity in Man or Beast, or that Monarchy would thereby be justify'd tho it were found in them. It cannot be in Beasts, for they know not what Govern∣ment is; and being uncapable of it, cannot distinguish the several sorts, nor consequently incline to one more than another. <HI>Salmasius</HI> his story of Bees is only fit for old Women to prate of in Chimny-corners; and they who represent Lions and Eagles as Kings of Birds and Beasts, do it only to show, that their Power is nothing but brutish Violence, exercis'd in the destruction of all that are not able to oppose it, and that has nothing of goodness or justice in it: which Similitude (tho it should prove to be in all respects adequate to the matter in question) could only shew, that those who have no sense of Right, Reason or Religion, have a natural propen∣sity to make use of their strength to the destruction of such as are weake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than they; and not that any are willing to submit, or not to resist it if they can; which I think will be of no great advantage to Monarchy. But whatever propensity may be in Beasts, it cannot be attributed gene∣rally to Men; for if it were, they never could have deviated from it, un∣less they were violently put out of their natural course; which in this case cannot be, for there is no Power to force them. But that they have most frequently deviated, appears by the various Forms of Government establish'd by them. There is therefore no natural propensity to any one, but they chuse that which in their judgment seems best for them. Or, if he would have that inconsiderate impulse, by which brutish and ignorant men may be sway'd when they know no better, to pass for a Propensity; others are no more oblig'd to follow it, than to live upon Acorns, or inhabit hollow Trees, because their Fathers did it when they had no better dwel∣lings, and found no better nourishment in the uncultivated World. And he that exhibits such Examples, as far as in him lies, endeavours to take from us the use of Reason, and, extinguishing the light of it, to make us live like the worst of Beasts, that we may be fit Subjects to absolute Monarchy. This may perhaps be our Author's intention, having learn'd from <HI>Aristotle,</HI> that such a Government is only sutable to the nature of the most bestial men, who being uncapable of governing themselves, fall un∣der the Power of such as will take the conduct of 'em: But he ought with∣al to have remember'd, that, according to <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s opinion, this Con∣ductor must be in nature different from those he takes the charge of; and if he be not, there can be no Government, nor Order, by which it sub∣sists: Beasts follow Beasts, and the blind lead the blind to destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="92"/>
 But tho I should grant this Propensity to be general, it could not be imputed to God, since man by Sin is fallen from the Law of his Creation. <HI>The wickedness of man</HI> (even in the first Ages) <HI>was great in the World: All the imaginations of his heart are evil, and that continually. All men are liars: There is none that doth good, no not one. Out of the heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulterys, Fornications, Thefts, false Testimonys,</HI> &amp;c. These are the Fruits of our corrupted nature, which the Apostle observing, dos not only make a difference between the natural and the spiritual Man, whose proceeding only can be refer'd to God, and that on∣ly so far as he is guided by his Spirit; but shews, that the natural man is in a perpetual enmity against God, without any possibility of being re∣concil'd to him, unless by the destruction of the old Man, and the rege∣nerating or renewing him thro the Spirit of Grace. There being no foot∣steps of this in our Author's Book, he and his Master <HI>Heylin</HI> may have differ'd from the Apostle, referring that Propensity of Nature to God, which he declares to be utter enmity against him; and we may conclude, that this Propensity, however general it may be, cannot be attributed to God as the Author of Nature, since it cannot be more general than the Corruptions into which we are fallen.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX. The Government instituted by God over the <HI>Israelites</HI> was Aristocratical.</HEAD>
<P>NOtwithstanding all this, our Author is resolv'd that Monarchy must be from God: <HI>What form of Government,</HI> says he, <HI>God ordain'd by his Authority, may be gather'd by that Commonwealth which he instituted a∣mongst the</HI> Hebrews; <HI>which was not Aristocratical, as</HI> Calvin <HI>says, but plainly Monarchical.</HI> I may in as few words deny the Government set up by God to have bin Monarchical, as he asserts it; but finding such Lan∣guage ordinarily to proceed from a mixture of folly, impudence and pride, I chuse rather to shew upon what I ground my Opinions, than nakedly to deliver them; most especially, when by insisting upon the Government instituted by God over his People, he refers us to the Scripture. And I do this the more boldly, since I follow <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Exposition, and believe that he having bin highly esteem'd for his Wit, Judgment, and Learning, by such as were endow'd with the like, and reverenc'd as a glorious Ser∣vant of God, might, if he were now alive, comfort himself, tho he had the misfortune to fall under the censures of <HI>Filmer</HI> and his followers. 'Tis probable he gave some Reasons for his Opinions; but our Author having maliciously conceal'd 'em, and I not having leasure at present to examin all his Writings to find 'em, must content my self with such as my small understanding may suggest, and such as I have found in ap∣proved Authors.</P>
<P>In the first place I may safely say, he was not alone of that opinion: <HI>Josephus, Philo,</HI> and <HI>Moses Maimonides,</HI> with all the best of the Jewish and Christian Authors, had long before deliver'd the same. <HI>Josephus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ant. Jud.</NOTE>says, that <HI>Saul</HI>'s first Sin by which he fell, was, <HI>that he took away the A∣ristocracy;</HI> which he could not do if it had never bin establish'd. <HI>Philo</HI> imputes the institution of Kingly Government, as it was in <HI>Israel,</HI> neither
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>
to God nor his Word, but to the fury of the sinful People. <HI>Abarbe∣nel</HI> says, it proceeded from their delight in the Idolatry to which their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abar. in 1 Sam. 8.</NOTE>Neighbours were addicted, and which could be upheld only by a Go∣vernment, in practice and principle contrary to that which God had in∣stituted. <HI>Maimonides</HI> frequently says the same thing, grounded upon the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maim. More-Nevochim.</NOTE>words of <HI>Hosea, I gave them Kings in my Wrath;</HI> and whosoever will call that a divine Institution, may give the same name to Plagues or Fa∣mines, and induce a necessity incumbent upon all men to go and search the one where they may find it, and to leave their Lands for ever unculti∣vated that they may be sure of the other: which being too bestial to be asserted by a man, I may safely say the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Kings were not instituted by God, but given as a punishment of their Sin, who despis'd the Go∣vernment he had instituted: and the above-mention'd Authors agree in the same thing, calling the Peoples desire to have a King, furious, mad, wicked, and proceeding from their love to the Idolatry of their Neigh∣bours, which was suted to their Government; both which were inconsi∣stent with what God had establish'd over his own People.</P>
<P>But waving the opinions of men, 'tis good to see what we can learn from the Scripture, and inquire if there be any Precept there expresly commanding them to make a King; or any Example that they did so whilst they continu'd obedient to the Word of God; or any thing from whence we may reasonably infer they ought to have done it: all which, if I mistake not, will be found directly contrary.</P>
<P>The only Precept that we find in the Law concerning Kings, is that of <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. already mention'd; and that is not a Command to the People to make, but Instructions what manner of King they should make if they desir'd to have one: There was therefore none at all.</P>
<P>Examples do as little favour our Author's Assertions. <HI>Moses, Joshua,</HI> and the other Judges, had not the name or power of Kings: They were not of the Tribe to which the Scepter was promis'd: They did not trans∣mit the Power they had to their Children, which in our Adversary's opi∣nion is a Right inseparable from Kings; and their Power was not conti∣nu'd by any kind of Succession, but created occasionally, as need requir'd, according to the Vertues discover'd in those who were rais'd by God to deliver the Nation in the time of their distress; which being done, their Children lay hid among the rest of the People. Thus were <HI>Ehud, Gide∣on, Jephtha,</HI> and others set up: <HI>Whosoever will give battel</HI> (say the Prin∣ces <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>and People of <HI>Gilead) to the Children of</HI> Ammon, <HI>shall be head over the Inheritance of</HI> Gilead: and finding <HI>Jephtha</HI> to be such a man as they sought, they made him their Chief, and all <HI>Israel</HI> follow'd them. When <HI>Othniel</HI> had shew'd his Valour in taking <HI>Kiriath Sepher,</HI> and delivering his Bre∣thren from <HI>Cushan-Rishathaim,</HI> he was made Judg: When <HI>Ehud</HI> had kill'd <HI>Eglon;</HI> when <HI>Shamgar</HI> and <HI>Samson</HI> had destroy'd great numbers of the <HI>Philistins;</HI> and when <HI>Gideon</HI> had defeated the <HI>Midianites,</HI> they were sit to be advanc'd above their Brethren. These Dignitys were not inhe∣rent in their Persons or Familys, but confer'd upon them; nor confer'd, that they might be exalted in Riches and Glory, but that they might be Ministers of Good to the People. This may justify <HI>Plato</HI>'s opini∣on, that if one man be found incomparably to excel all others in the Vertues that are beneficial to Civil Societys, he ought to be advanc'd a∣bove all: but I think it will be hard from thence to deduce an Argument in favour of such a Monarchy as is necessarily to descend to the next in Blood, whether Man, Woman, or Child, without any consideration of
<PB N="86" REF="94"/>
 Vertue, Age, Sex, or Ability; and that failing, it can be of no use to our Author. But whatever the dignity of a <HI>Hebrew</HI> Judg was, and how∣soever he was rais'd to that Office, it certainly differ'd from that of a King. <HI>Gideon</HI> could not have refus'd to be a King when the People would have made him so, if he had bin a King already; or that God from the beginning had appointed they should have one: The Elders and People <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8.</NOTE>could not have ask'd a King of <HI>Samuel,</HI> if he had bin King; and he could not without impiety have bin displeas'd with them for asking such a one as God had appointed; neither would God have said to him, <HI>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them,</HI> if he had ordain'd what they desir'd.</P>
<P>They did not indeed reject God with their Mouths: They pretended to use the liberty he had given them to make a King; but would have such a one as he had forbidden: They drew near to him with their Lips, but their Hearts were far from him; and he seeing their Hypocrisy, se∣verely chastis'd 'em in granting their ill conceiv'd request; and foretold the Miserys that should thereupon befal 'em, from which he would not deliver 'em, tho they should cry to him by reason of what they suf∣fer'd from their King▪ He was their Creature, and the mischiefs thereby brought upon them were the fruits of their own labour.</P>
<P>This is that which our Author calls God's institution of Kings; but the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 13.</NOTE>Prophet explains the matter much better, <HI>I gave them Kings in my anger, and took them away in my wrath:</HI> in destroying them God brought desolati∣on upon the people that had sinn'd in asking for them, and following their example in all kind of Wickedness. This is all that our Author has to boast of: but God who acknowledges those works only to be his own, which proceed from his goodness and mercy to his People, disowns this; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 8.</NOTE><HI>Israel hath cast off the thing that is good</HI> (even the Government that he had establish'd) <HI>the Enemy shall pursue him: They have set up Kings, but not by me; and Princes, but I know them not.</HI> As if he sought to justify the severity of his Judgments brought upon them by the wickedness of their Kings, that they, not he, had ordain'd.</P>
<P>Having seen what Government God did not ordain, it may be seasona∣ble to examin the Nature of the Government which he did ordain; and we shall easily find that it consisted of three parts, besides the Magistrats of the several Tribes and Citys. They had a chief Magistrat, who was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 11.</NOTE>call'd Judg or Captain, as <HI>Joshua, Gideon,</HI> and others; a Council of se∣venty chosen men; and the General Assemblys of the People.</P>
<P>The first was merely occasional, like to the Dictators of <HI>Rome:</HI> and as the <HI>Romans</HI> in times of danger frequently chose such a Man as was much esteem'd for Valour and Wisdom, God's peculiar People had a peculiar re∣gard to that Wisdom and Valour which was accompanied with his Pre∣sence, hoping for deliverance only from him.</P>
<P>The second is known by the name of the Great <HI>Sanhedrin,</HI> which be∣ing instituted by <HI>Moses</HI> according to the command of God, continu'd, till they were all save one slain by <HI>Herod.</HI> And the third part, which is the Assembly of the People, was so common, that none can be ignorant of it, but such as never look'd into the Scripture. When the Tribes of <HI>Reu∣ben, Gad,</HI> and half that of <HI>Manasseh</HI> had built an Altar on the side of <HI>Jor∣dan,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Josh. 22.</NOTE><HI>The whole Congregation of the Children of</HI> Israel <HI>gather'd together at</HI> Shiloh <HI>to go up to war against them, and sent</HI> Phineas <HI>the Son of</HI> Eleazer, <HI>and with him ten Princes,</HI> &amp;c. This was the highest and most important action that could concern a People, even War or Peace, and that not
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
with Strangers, but their own Brethren. <HI>Joshua</HI> was then alive: The Elders never fail'd: yet this was not transacted by him or them, but by the collected body of the People; <HI>for They sent Phineas.</HI> This Demo∣cratical Embassy was Democratically receiv'd: It was not directed to one Man, but to all the Children of <HI>Reuben, Gad,</HI> and <HI>Manasseh,</HI> and the Answer was sent by them all; which being pleasing to <HI>Phineas,</HI> and the ten that were with him, they made their report to the Congregation, and all was quiet.</P>
<P>The last eminent Act perform'd by <HI>Joshua</HI> was the calling of a like As∣sembly to <HI>Shechem,</HI> compos'd of Elders, Heads of Familys, Judges, Of∣ficers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jos. 24.</NOTE>and all the People, to whom he propos'd, and they agreeing made a Covenant before the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Joshua</HI> being dead, the Proceedings of every Tribe were grounded up∣on Counsels taken at such Assemblys among themselves for their own concerns, as appears by the Actions of <HI>Judah, Simeon,</HI> &amp;c. against the <HI>Canaanites;</HI> and when the <HI>Levite</HI> complain'd that his Wife had bin forc'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 1.</NOTE>by those of <HI>Gibeah,</HI> the whole Congregation of <HI>Israel</HI> met together at <HI>Mispeth</HI> from all parts, <HI>even from</HI> Dan <HI>to</HI> Beersheba, as one man, and there resolv'd upon that terrible War which they made against the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin.</HI> The like Assembly was gather'd together for the election of <HI>Saul,</HI> every man was there: and tho the Elders only are said to have ask'd a King of <HI>Samuel,</HI> they seem to have bin deputed from the whole Congregation; for God said, <HI>Hearken to the Voice of the People.</HI> In the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8. 7.</NOTE>same manner the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and after that the rest, chose and a∣nointed <HI>David</HI> to be their King. After the death of <HI>Solomon</HI> all <HI>Israel</HI> met together to treat with <HI>Rehoboam;</HI> and not receiving satisfaction from him, ten of the Tribes abrogated his Kingdom.</P>
<P>If these Actions were consider'd singly by themselves, <HI>Calvin</HI> might have given the name of a Democracy to the Hebrew Government, as well as to that of <HI>Athens;</HI> for without doubt they evidently manifest the su∣preme Power to have bin in the supreme manner in these General Assem∣blys: but the Government (as to its outward order) consisting of those three parts, which comprehend the three simple <HI>species;</HI> and no times having bin appointed, nor occasions specify'd, upon which Judges should be chosen, or these Assemblys call'd, whereas the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> which was the Aristocratical part, was permanent; the whole might rightly be call'd an Aristocracy, that part prevailing above the others: and tho <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI> calls it a Theocracy, by reason of God's presence with his People; yet in relation to man he calls it an Aristocracy, and says that <HI>Saul</HI>'s first Sin by which he fell from the Kingdom was, that <HI>Gubernationem optimatum sustulit;</HI> which could not be, if they were govern'd by a Monarch before he was chosen.</P>
<P>Our Author taking no notice of these matters, first endeavours to prove the excellency of Monarchy from natural instinct; and then begging the question, says, that God did always govern his People by Monarchy: whereas he ought in the first place to have observ'd that this instinct (if there be any such thing) is only an irrational appetite, attributed to Beasts, that know not why they do any thing; and is to be follow'd only by those men who being equally irrational, live in the same igno∣rance: and the second being prov'd to be absolutely false by the ex∣press words of the Scripture, <HI>There was then no King in</HI> Israel, seve∣ral <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 18.</NOTE>times repeated, and the whole series of the History, he has no other evasion than to say, <HI>That even then the</HI> Israelites <HI>were under the</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>
 <HI>Kingly Government of the Fathers of particular Familys.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by the foremention'd Text cited also by our Author, that in the Assembly of the People, gather'd together to take counsel concerning the War against <HI>Benjamin,</HI> were four hundred thousand Footmen that drew Sword: They all arose together, saying, Not a man of us shall go to his Tent. <HI>So all the men of</HI> Israel <HI>were gather'd together against the City.</HI> This is repeated several times in the relation. The <HI>Benjamites</HI> proceeded in the like manner in preparing for their defence; and if all these who did so meet to consult and determin were Monarchs, there were then in <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> four hundred twenty six thousand seven hundred Monarchs or Kings, tho the Scripture says there was not one.</P>
<P>If yet our Author insists upon his notion of Kingly Government, I de∣sire to know who were the Subjects, if all these were Kings; for the Text says, that the <HI>whole Congregation was gather'd together as one man from</HI> Dan <HI>to</HI> Beersheba. If there can be so many Kings without one Subject, what becomes of the Right of <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> that was to have bin devolv'd upon one Man as Heir to them, and thereby Lord of all? If e∣very man had an equal part in that inheritance, and by virtue of it be∣came a King, why is not the same eternally subdivided to as many men as are in the World, who are also Kings? If this be their natural condi∣tion, how comes it to be alter'd, till they dethrone themselves by consent, to set up one or more to have a power over them all? Why should they devest themselves of their natural Right to set up one above them∣selves, unless in consideration of their own good? If the 426700 Kings might retain the power in themselves, or give it to one, why might they not give it to any such number of men as should best please themselves, or retain it in their own hands, as they did till the days of <HI>Saul;</HI> or frame, limit, and direct it according to their own pleasure? If this be true, God is the Author of Democracy; and no assertor of human Li∣berty did ever claim more than the People of God did enjoy and exercise at the time when our Author says they were under the Kingly Govern∣ment; which Liberty being not granted by any peculiar concession or in∣stitution, the same must belong to all Mankind.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to say the 426700 men were heads of Familys; for the Scripture only says, <HI>They were Footmen that drew the Sword,</HI> or rather all the men of <HI>Israel</HI> from <HI>Dan</HI> to <HI>Beersheba,</HI> who were able to make War. When six hundred <HI>Benjamites</HI> did only remain of the 26700, 'tis plain that no more were left of that Tribe, their Women and Children having bin destroy'd in the Citys after their defeat. The next Chapter makes the matter yet more plain; for when all that were at the Congregation in <HI>Mispeth</HI> were found to have sworn, they would not give their Daughters to any of the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> no <HI>Israelite</HI> was free from the Oath, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dg. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE>the men of <HI>Jabesh Gilead,</HI> who had not bin at the Assembly: All the rest of <HI>Israel</HI> was therefore comprehended; and they continuing to govern in a popular way with absolute power, sent twelve thousand of their most valiant men to destroy all the Males of <HI>Jabesh Gilead,</HI> and the Women that had lain by Man, reserving the Virgins for the <HI>Benjamites.</HI> This is enough for my purpose: for the question is not concerning the power that every Housholder in <HI>London</HI> has over his Wife, Children and Servants; but whether they are all perpetually subject to one man and Family; and I intend not to set up their Wives, Prentices, and Children against them, or to diminish their Rights, but to assert them, as the gift of God and Nature, no otherwise to be restrain'd than by Laws made with their own consent.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="97"/>
Reason failing, our Author pleases himself with terms of his own In∣vention: <HI>When the People beg'd a King of</HI> Samuel, <HI>they were govern'd by a Kingly power: God out of a special love and care to the House of</HI> Israel, <HI>did chuse to be their King himself, and did govern them at that time by his Vice∣roy</HI> Samuel <HI>and his Sons.</HI> The behaviour of the <HI>Israelites</HI> towards <HI>Samuel</HI> has bin thought proud, perverse, and obstinate; but the fine Court-word <HI>begging</HI> was never before apply'd to them; and their insolent fury was not only seen against <HI>Samuel,</HI> but again&amp;;st God; <HI>They have not rejected thee,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8.</NOTE><HI>but they have rejected me.</HI> And I think <HI>Filmer</HI> is the first who ever found that Beggars in begging did reject him of whom they beg'd: Or if they were Beggars, they were such as would not be denied; for after all that <HI>Samuel</HI> had said to dissuade them from their wicked design, they said, <HI>Nay, but we will have a King.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>But lest I should be thought too much inclin'd to contradict our Au∣thor, I confess that once he has happen'd to be in the right. <HI>God out of a special love to the House of</HI> Israel <HI>chose to be their King: He gave them Laws, prescrib'd a Form of Government, rais'd up Men in a wonderful man∣ner to execute it, fill'd them with his Spirit, was ever present when they call'd up∣on him: He gave them counsel in their doubts, and assistance in all their ex∣tremitys: He made a Covenant with them, and would be exalted by them.</HI> But what is this to an earthly Monarch? Who can from hence derive a Right to any one man to play the Lord over his Brethren, or a reason why any Nation should set him up? God is our Lord by right of creation, and our only Lord, because he only has created us. If any other were equal to him in Wisdom, Power, Goodness, and Beneficence to us, he might challenge the same duty from us. If growing out of our selves, re∣ceiving being from none, depending on no providence, we were offer'd the protection of a Wisdom subject to no error, a Goodness that could never fail, and a Power that nothing could resist; it were reasonable for us to enter into a Covenant, submit our selves to him, and with all the facultys of our minds to addict our selves to his Service. But what Right can from hence accrue to a mortal Creature like to one of us, from whom we have receiv'd nothing, and who stands in need of help as much as we? Who can from hence deduce an argument to persuade us to depend upon his Wisdom, who has as little as other men? To submit to his Will who is subject to the same Frailtys, Passions, and Vices with the rest of Mankind? Or to expect protection and defence from him whose life depends upon as slender threds as our own; and who can have no power but that which we confer upon him? If this cannot be done, but is of all things the most contrary to common sense, no man can in himself have any right over us; we are all as free as the four hundred twenty six thousand seven hundred Hebrew Kings: We can naturally owe allegiance to none; and I doubt whether all the lusts that have reign'd amongst Men since the beginning of the World, have brought more guilt and misery upon them than that preposterous and impudent pretence of imitating what God had instituted. When <HI>Saul</HI> set himself most violently to oppose the command of God, he pretended to fulfil it: When the <HI>Jews</HI> grew weary of God's Government, and resolv'd to re∣ject him, that he should not reign over them, they us'd some of <HI>Moses</HI> his words, and ask'd that King of God, whom they intended to set up against him: But this King had not bin set up against God, the People had not rejected God, and sin'd in asking for him, if every Nation by a general Law ought to have one, or by a particular Law one had bin
<PB N="90" REF="98"/>
 appointed by him over them. There was therefore no King amongst them, nor any Law of God or Nature, particular or general, according to which they ought to have one.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. X. <HI>Aristotle</HI> was not simply for Monarchy or against Popular Govern∣ment; but approv'd or disapprov'd of either according to circum∣stances.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author well observes that <HI>Aristotle</HI> is hardly brought to give a general opinion in favour of Monarchy, as if it were the best form of Government, or to say true, never dos it. He uses much caution, proposes conditions and limitations, and makes no decision but accord∣ing to circumstances. Men of Wisdom and Learning are subject to such doubts; but none ought to wonder if stupidity and ignorance defend <HI>Fil∣mer</HI> and his Followers from them; or that their hatred to the antient Vertue should give 'em an aversion to the Learning that was the Nurse of it. Those who neither understand the several Species of Government, nor the various Tempers of Nations, may without fear or shame give their opinions in favour of that which best pleases them; but wise men will always proportion their praises to the merit of the Subject, and never commend that simply which is good only according to circumstances. <HI>Aristotle</HI> highly applauds Monarchy, when the Monarch has more of those Vertues that tend to the good of a Commonwealth, than all they who compose it. This is the King mention'd in his <HI>Ethicks,</HI> and extol'd in his <HI>Politicks:</HI> He is above all by Nature, and ought not by a muni∣cipal Law to be made equal to others in Power: He ought to go∣vern, because 'tis better for a People to be govern'd by him, than to enjoy their Liberty; or rather, they do enjoy their Liberty, which is never more safe, than when defended by one who is a liv∣ing Law to himself and others. Wheresoever such a man appears, he ought to reign: He bears in his Person the Divine Character of a Sove∣reign: God has rais'd him above all; and such as will not submit to him, ought to be accounted Sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> brought forth and slain. But he dos withal confess, that if no such man be found, there is no natural King: All the Prerogatives belonging to him vanish, for want of one who is capable of enjoying them. He lays severe Censures upon those who not being thus qualified take upon them to govern men, equal to or better than themselves; and judges the assumption of such Powers by persons not naturally adapted to the administration of them, as barbarous Usurpations, which no Law or Reason can justify; and is not so much transported with the excellency of this true King, as not to <NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>confess he ought to be limited by Law: <HI>Qui legem praeesse jubet, videtur jubere praeesse Deum &amp; Leges: qui autem hominem praeesse jubet, adjungit &amp; bestiam; libido quippe talis est, atque obliquos agit, etiam viros optimos qui sunt in pot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>state, ex quo mens atque appetitus Lex est.</HI> This agrees with the words of the best King that is known to have bin in the world, pro∣ceeding, as is most probable, from a sense of the Passions that reign'd in his own breast; <HI>Man being in honour, has no understanding, but is like to the beast that perishes.</HI> This shews that such as deny that Kings do reign
<PB N="91" REF="99"/>
by Law, or that Laws may be put upon Kings, do equally set themselves against the opinions of wise Men, and the Word of God: and our Au∣thor having found that Learning made the <HI>Grecians</HI> seditious, may reaso∣nably doubt that Religion may make others worse; so as none will be fit Subjects of his applauded Government, but those who have neither Religion nor Learning; and that it cannot be introduc'd till both be ex∣tinguish'd.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> having declar'd his mind concerning Government, in the Books expresly written on that Subject, whatsoever is said by the by in his Moral Discourses, must be refer'd to and interpreted by the other: And if he said (which I do not find) that Monarchy is the best Form of Government, and a Popular State the worst, he cannot be thought to have meant otherwise, than that those Nations were the most happy, who had such a Man as he thinks fit to be made a Monarch; and those the most unhappy, who neither had such a one, nor a few, that any way excel'd the rest; but all being equally brutish, must take upon 'em the Government they were unable to manage: for he dos no where admit any other end of Just and Civil Government, than the good of the Governed; nor any advantage due to one or a few persons, unless for such Vertues as conduce to the common good of the Society. And as our Author thinks Learning makes men seditious, <HI>Aristotle</HI> also acknow∣ledges, that those who have Understanding and Courage, which may be taken for Learning, or the effect of it, will never endure the Govern∣ment of one or a few that do not excel them in Vertue: but no where dispraises a Popular Government, unless the Multitude be compos'd of such as are barbarous, stupid, leud, vicious, and uncapable of the Hap∣piness for which Governments are instituted; who cannot live to them∣selves, but like a herd of Beasts must be brought under the dominion of another; or who, having among themselves such an excellent Person as is above describ'd, will not submit to him, but either kill, banish, or bring him to be equal with others, whom God had made to excel all. I do not trouble my self, or the Reader, with citing here and there a Line out of his Books, but refer my self to those who have perus'd his Moral and Political Writings, submitting to the severest Censures, if this be not the true Sense of 'em; and that Vertue alone, in his opinion, ought to give the preheminence. And as <HI>Aristotle</HI> following the wise Men of those times, shews us how far Reason, improv'd by Meditation, can advance in the knowledge and love of that which is truly good; so we may in <HI>Filmer</HI> guided by <HI>Heylin,</HI> see an Example of corrupted Christians, who extingui∣shing the Light of Religion by their Vices, and degenerating into Beasts (whilst they endeavour to support the personal Interest of some men, who are rais'd to Dignitys by the consent of Nations, or by unwarran∣table ways and means) would cast all the Power into the hands of such as happen to be born in certain Familys; as if Governments had not bin instituted for the common good of Nations, but only to increase their Pride, and foment their Vices; or that the care and direction of a great People were so easy a work, that every Man, Woman, or Child, how young, weak, foolish or wicked soever, may be worthy of it, and able to manage it.</P>

<HEAD> SECT. XI. Liberty produces Vertue, Order and Stability: Slavery is accompanied with Vice, Weakness and Misery.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's judgment, as well as inclinations to Vertue, are ma∣nifested in the preference he gives to the manners of the <HI>Assyrians</HI> and other Eastern Nations, before the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans:</HI> Whereas the first were never remarkable for any thing, but Pride, Leudness, Treachery, Cruelty, Cowardice, Madness, and hatred to all that is good; whilst the others excel'd in Wisdom, Valour, and all the Vertues that deserve imitation. This was so well observ'd by St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> that <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Civ. Dei.</NOTE>he brings no stronger Argument to prove, that God leaves nothing that is good in man unrewarded, than that he gave the dominion of the best part of the World to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who in moral Vertues excel'd all other Na∣tions. And I think no Example can be alledg'd of a Free People that has ever bin conquer'd by an Absolute Monarch, unless he did incomparably surpass them in Riches and Strength; whereas many great Kings have bin overthrown by small Republicks: and the success being constantly the same, it cannot be attributed to Fortune, but must necessarily be the pro∣duction of Vertue and good Order. <HI>Machiavel</HI> discoursing of these mat∣ters, finds Vertue to be so essentially necessary to the establishment and preservation of Liberty, that he thinks it impossible for a corrupted Peo∣ple to set up a good Government, or for a Tyranny to be introduc'd if they be vertuous; and makes this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si puo far questa conclusione, che dove la materia non e corrotta, i tumulti ed altri scandali non nuocono: là dove la e corrotta le buone Leggi non giovano. <BIBL><HI>Machiav.</HI> Disc. sopra <HI>T. Livio,</HI> lib. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>Conclusion, <HI>That where the Matter</HI> (that is, the body of the People) <HI>is not corrupted, Tumults and Disorders do no hurt; and where it is corrupted, good Laws do no good:</HI> Which being confirm'd by Reason and Experience, I think no wise man has ever con∣tradicted him.</P>
<P>But I do not more wonder that <HI>Filmer</HI> should look upon Absolute Mo∣narchy to be the Nurse of Vertue, tho we see they did never subsist toge∣ther, than that he should attribute Order and Stability to it; whereas Order principally consists in appointing to every one his right Place, Of∣fice or Work; and he lays the whole weight of the Government upon one Person, who very often dos neither deserve, nor is able to bear the least part of it. <HI>Plato, Aristotle, Hooker,</HI> and (I may say in short) all wise men have held, that Order requir'd that the wisest, best, and most valiant should be plac'd in the Offices where Wisdom, Vertue and Va∣lour are requisit. If common sense did not teach us this, we might learn it from the Scripture. When God gave the conduct of his People to <HI>Moses, Joshua, Samuel,</HI> and others, he endow'd them with all the Ver∣tues and Graces requir'd for the right performance of their Duty. When the <HI>Israelites</HI> were opprest by the <HI>Midianites, Philistins</HI> and <HI>Ammonites,</HI> they expected help from the most vise and valiant. When <HI>Hannibal</HI> was at the Gates of <HI>Rome,</HI> and had fill'd <HI>Italy</HI> with Fire and Blood; or when the <HI>Gauls</HI> overwhelm'd that Country with their multitudes and fury, the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> put themselves under the conduct of <HI>Ca∣millus,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="101"/>
<HI>Manlius, Fabius, Scipio,</HI> and the like; and when they fail'd to chuse such as were fit for the work to be done, they receiv'd such defeats as convinc'd 'em of their Error. But if our Author say true, Order re∣quir'd that the Power of defending the Country should have bin annex'd as an Inheritance to one Family, or left to him that could get it, and the exercise of all Authority committed to the next in Blood, tho the weakest of Women, or the basest of Men.</P>
<P>The like may be said of judging, or doing of Justice; and 'tis absurd to pretend that either is expected from the Power, not the Person of the Monarch; for experience dos too well shew how much all things halt in relation to Justice or Defence, when there is a defect in him that ought to judg us, and to fight our Battels. But of all things this ought least to be alledg'd by the Advocats for absolute Monarchy, who deny that the Authority can be separated from the Person, and lay it as a fundamental Principle, that whosoever has it may do what he pleases, and be accoun∣table to no man.</P>
<P>Our Author's next work is to shew, that Stability is the effect of this good Order; but he ought to have known, that Stability is then only worthy of praise, when it is in that which is good. No man delights in sickness or pain, because it is long, or incurable; nor in slavery and misery, because it is perpetual: much less will any man in his senses com∣mend a permanency in vice and wickedness. He must therefore prove, that the Stability he boasts of is in things that are good, or all that he says of it signifies nothing.</P>
<P>I might leave him here with as little fear, that any man who shall e∣spouse his Quarrel, will ever be able to remove this Obstacle, as that he himself should rise out of his Grave and do it. But I hope to prove, that of all things under the Sun, there is none more mutable or unstable than absolute Monarchy; which is all that I dispute against, professing much veneration for that which is mix'd, regulated by Law, and directed to the Publick Good.</P>
<P>This might be prov'd by many Arguments, but I shall confine my self to two; the one drawn from Reason, the other from matters of Fact.</P>
<P>Nothing can be call'd stable, that is not so in Principle and Practice, in which respect human Nature is not well capable of Stability; but the ut∣most deviation from it that can be imagin'd, is, when such an Error is laid for a Foundation as can never be corrected. All will confess, that if there be any stability in man, it must be in Wisdom and Vertue, and in those Actions that are thereby directed; for in weakness, folly and mad∣ness, there can be none. The Stability therefore that we seek, in rela∣tion to the exercise of Civil and Military Powers, can never be found, unless care be taken that such as exercise those Powers, be endow'd with the Qualitys that should make them stable. This is utterly repugnant to our Author's Doctrin: He lays for a Foundation, That the Succession goes to the next in Blood, without distinction of Age, Sex, or personal Qualitys; whereas even he himself could not have the impudence to say, that Children, and Women (where they are admitted) or Fools, Mad∣men, and such as are full of all wickedness, do not come to be the Heirs of reigning Familys, as well as of the meanest. The Stability therefore that can be expected from such a Government, either depends upon those who have none in themselves, or is refer'd wholly to Chance, which is directly opposite to Stability.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="102"/>
 This would be the case, tho it were (as we say) an even Wager, whether the Person would be fit or unfit, and that there were as many men in the world able, as unable to perform the Duty of a King; but Experience shewing that among many millions of men, there is hardly one that possesses the Qualitys requir'd in a King, 'tis so many to one, that he upon whom the Lot shall fall, will not be the man we seek, in whose Person and Government there can be such a stability as is asserted. And that failing, all must necessarily fail; for there can be no stability in his Will, Laws or Actions, who has none in his Person.</P>
<P>That we may see whether this be verify'd by Experience, we need not search into the dark relations of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> and <HI>Assyrian</HI> Monarchys: Those rude Ages afford us little instruction; and tho the fragments of History remaining do sufficiently show, that all things there were in per∣petual fluctuation, by reason of the madness of their Kings, and the vio∣lence of those who transported the Empire from one Place or Family to another, I will not much rely upon them, but slightly touching some of their Storys, pass to those that are better known to us.</P>
<P>The Kings of those Ages seem to have liv'd rather like Beasts in a Fo∣rest, than Men join'd in Civil Society: they follow'd the Example of <HI>Nimrod</HI> the mighty Hunter; Force was the only Law that prevail'd, the stronger devour'd the weaker, and continu'd in Power till ejected by one of more strength or better fortune. By this means the race of <HI>Ninus</HI> was destroy'd by <HI>Belochus: Arbaces</HI> rent the Kingdom asunder, and took <HI>Media</HI> to himself: <HI>Morodach</HI> extinguish'd the Race of <HI>Belochus,</HI> and was made King: <HI>Nabuchodonosor</HI> like a Flood overwhelm'd all for a time, destroy'd the Kingdoms of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> with many others, and found no obstacle, till his rage and pride turn'd to a most bestial madness: And the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Empire was wholly abolish'd at the death of his Grand∣child <HI>Belshazzar;</HI> and no Stability can be found in the reigns of those great Kings, unless that name be given to the Pride, Idolatry, Cruelty, and Wickedness in which they remain'd constant. If we examin matters more distinctly, we shall find that all things vari'd according to the hu∣mour of the Prince. Whilst <HI>Pharaoh</HI> liv'd, who had receiv'd many sig∣nal Services from <HI>Joseph,</HI> the <HI>Israelites</HI> were well us'd: but when another rose up who knew him not, they were persecuted with all the extremitys of Injustice and Cruelty, till the furious King persisting in his design of exterminating them, brought destruction upon himself and the Nation. Where the like Power has prevail'd, it has ever produc'd the like effects. When some great men of <HI>Persia</HI> had persuaded <HI>Darius,</HI> that it was a fine thing to command that no man for the space of thirty days should make any Petition to God or Man, but to the King only, <HI>Daniel</HI> the most wise and holy Man then in the world must be thrown to the Lions. When God <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>had miraculously sav'd him, the same Sentence was pass'd against the Princes of the Nation. When <HI>Haman</HI> had fill'd <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> his ears with Lies, all the <HI>Jews</HI> were appointed to be slain; and when the fraud of that Villain was detected, leave was given them, with the like precipitancy, to kill whom they pleas'd. When the <HI>Israelites</HI> came to have Kings, they were subject to the same Storms, and always with their Blood suffer'd the Penalty of their Princes madness. When one kind of Fury possest <HI>Saul,</HI> he slew the Priests, persecuted <HI>David,</HI> and would have kill'd his brave Son <HI>Jonathan:</HI> When he fell under another, he took upon him to do the Priest's Office, pretended to understand the Word of God better than <HI>Samuel,</HI> and spar'd those that God had commanded him to destroy:
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
Upon another whimsy he kill'd the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> and never rested from finding new Inventions to vex the People, till he had brought many thou∣sands of them to perish with himself and his Sons on Mount <HI>Gilboa.</HI> We do not find any King, in Wisdom, Valour and Holiness, equal to <HI>Da∣vid;</HI> and yet he falling under the temptations that attend the greatest Fortunes, brought Civil Wars and a Plague upon the Nation. When <HI>Solomon</HI>'s heart was drawn away by strange Women, he fill'd the Land with Idols, and opprest the People with intolerable Tributes. <HI>Rehobo∣am</HI>'s Folly made that Rent in the Kingdom which could never be made up. Under his Successors the people serv'd God, <HI>Baal</HI> or <HI>Ashtaroth,</HI> as best pleas'd him who had the Power; and no other marks of Stability can be alledg'd to have bin in that Kingdom, than the constancy of their Kings in the practice of Idolatry, their cruelty to the Prophets, hatred to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and civil Wars producing such Slaughters as are reported in few other Storys: The Kingdom was in the space of about two hundred years possest by nine several Familys, not one of 'em getting possession otherwise than by the slaughter of his Predecessor, and the extinction of his Race; and ended in the Bondage of the ten Tribes, which continues to this day.</P>
<P>He that desires farther proofs of this Point, may seek 'em in the Histo∣rys of <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> and his Successors: He seems to have bin endow'd with all the Vertues that Nature improv'd by Disciplin did ever attain, so that he is believ'd to be the man meant by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who on account of the excellency of his Vertues was by Nature fram'd for a King; and <HI>Plutarch</HI> ascribes his Conquests rather to those, than to his Fortune. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in Vic. Alex.</NOTE>But even that Vertue was overthrown by the Successes that accompanied it: He burnt the most magnificent Palace of the world in a frolick, to please a mad drunken Whore: Upon the most frivolous suggestions of Eunuchs and Rascals, he kill'd the best and bravest of his Friends; and his Valour, which had no equal, not subsisting without his other Ver∣tues, perish'd when he became leud, proud, cruel and superstitious; so as it may be truly said, he died a Coward. His Successors did not differ from him: When they had kill'd his Mother, Wife and Children, they exercis'd their fury against one another; and tearing the Kingdom to pieces, the Survivors left the Sword as an Inheritance to their Familys, who perish'd by it, or under the weight of the <HI>Roman</HI> Chains.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Romans</HI> had lost that Liberty which had bin the Nurse of their Vertue, and gain'd the Empire in lieu of it, they attain'd to our Author's applauded Stability. <HI>Julius</HI> being slain in the Senat, the first Question was, whether it could be restor'd, or not? And that being de∣cided by the Battel of <HI>Philippi,</HI> the Conquerors set themselves to destroy all the eminent men in the City, as the best means to establish the Mo∣narchy. <HI>Augustus</HI> gain'd it by the death of <HI>Antonius,</HI> and the corruption of the Soldiers; and he dying naturally, or by the fraud of his Wife, the Empire was transfer'd to her Son <HI>Tiberius;</HI> under whom the mi∣serable People suffer'd the worst effects of the most impure Lust and inhuman Cruelty: He being stifled the Government went on with much uniformity and stability; <HI>Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius</HI> regularly and constantly did all the mischief they could, and were not more like to each other in the Villanys they committed, than in the Deaths they suffer'd. <HI>Vespasian</HI>'s more gentle Reign did no way com∣pensate the Blood he spilt to attain the Empire: And the Benefits receiv'd from <HI>Titus</HI> his short liv'd Vertue, were infinitly overbalanc'd by the de∣testable
<PB N="96" REF="104"/>
 Vices of his Brother <HI>Domitian,</HI> who turn'd all things into the old Channel of Cruelty, Lust, Rapine and Perfidiousness. His slaugh∣ter gave a little breath to the gasping perishing World; and men might be vertuous under the Government of <HI>Nerva, Trajan, Antoninus, Aure∣lius,</HI> and a few more; tho even in their time Religion was always dange∣rous. But when the Power fell into the hands of <HI>Commodus, Heliogaba∣lus, Caracalla,</HI> and others of that sort, nothing was safe but obscurity, or the utmost excesses of leudness and baseness. However, whilst the Will of the Governor pass'd for a Law, and the Power did usually fall into the hands of such as were most bold and violent, the utmost security that any man could have for his Person or Estate, depended upon his temper; and Princes themselves, whether good or bad, had no longer Leases of their lives, than the furious and corrupted Soldiers would give them; and the Empire of the World was changeable, according to the Success of a Battel.</P>
<P>Matters were not much mended when the Emperors became Christi∣ans: Some favour'd those who were call'd <HI>Orthodox,</HI> and gave great Re∣venues to corrupt the Clergy. Others supported <HI>Arianism,</HI> and persecu∣ted the Orthodox with as much asperity as the Pagans had done. Some revolted, and shew'd themselves more fierce against the professors of Christianity, than they that had never had any knowledg of it. The World was torn in pieces amongst them, and often suffer'd as great mise∣rys by their sloth, ignorance and co wardice, as by their fury and mad∣ness, till the Empire was totally dissolv'd and lost. That which under the weakness and irregularity of a popular Government, had conquer'd all from the <HI>Euphrates</HI> to <HI>Britain,</HI> and destroy'd the Kingdoms of <HI>Asia, E∣gypt, Macedon, Numidia,</HI> and a multitude of others, was made a Prey to unknown barbarous Nations, and rent into as many pieces as it had bin compos'd of, when it enjoy'd the Stability that accompanys Divine and Absolute Monarchy.</P>
<P>The like may be said of all the Kingdoms in the World: they may have their ebbings and flowings according to the Vertues or Vices of Prin∣ces or their Favorites; but can never have any Stability, because there is, and can be none in them. Or if any Exception may be brought against this Rule, it must be of those Monarchys only which are mix'd and regu∣lated by Laws, where Diets, Parliaments, Assemblys of Estates, or Se∣nats, may supply the defects of a Prince, restrain him if he prove extra∣vagant, and reject such as are found to be unworthy of their Office, which are as odious to our Author and his Followers, as the most popular Go∣vernments, and can be of no advantage to his Cause.</P>
<P>There is another ground of perpetual Fluctuation in Absolute Monar∣chys; or such as are grown so strong, that they cannot be restrain'd by Law, tho according to their Institution they ought to be, distinct from, but in some measure relating to the Inclinations of the Monarch, that is, the impulse of Ministers, Favorites, Wives or Whores, who frequently govern all things according to their own Passions or Interests. And tho we cannot say who were the Favorites of every one of the <HI>Assyrian</HI> or <HI>Egyptian</HI> Kings, yet the Examples before-mention'd of the different me∣thod follow'd in <HI>Egypt</HI> before and after the death of <HI>Joseph,</HI> and in <HI>Persis</HI> whilst the idolatrous Princes, and <HI>Haman,</HI> or <HI>Daniel, Esther</HI> and <HI>Mor∣decai</HI> were in credit; the violent Changes happening thereupon, give us reason to believe the like were in the times of other Kings: and if we ex∣amin the Historys of latter Ages, and the Lives of Princes that are more
<PB N="97" REF="105"/>
exactly known, we shall find that Kingdoms are more frequently sway'd by those who have Power with the Prince, than by his own Judgment: So that whosoever has to deal with Princes concerning Foreign or Dome∣stick Affairs, is oblig'd more to regard the humour of those Persons, than the most important Interests of a Prince or People.</P>
<P>I might draw too much envy upon my self, if I should take upon me to cite all the Examples of this kind that are found in modern Historys, or the Memoirs that do more precisely shew the Temper of Princes, and the secret Springs by which they were mov'd. But as those who have well observ'd the management of Affairs in <HI>France</HI> during the Reigns of <HI>Francis</HI> the First, <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, <HI>Francis</HI> the Second, <HI>Charles</HI> the Ninth, <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, and <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth, will confess, that the Interests of the Dukes of <HI>Montmorency</HI> and <HI>Guise,</HI> Queen <HI>Katherine de Medicis,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Epernon, La <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osseuse, Madame de Guiche, de Gabriele, d' Entragues,</HI> the <HI>Marechal d' Ancre,</HI> the Constable <HI>de Luines,</HI> and the Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> were more to be consider'd by those who had any publick or private Business to treat at Court, than the Opinions of those Princes, or the most weighty Concernments of the State; so it cannot be denied, that other Kingdoms where Princes legally have, or wrongfully usurp the like Power, are govern'd in the like manner; or if it be, there is hardly any Prince's Reign that will not furnish abun∣dant proof of what I have asserted.</P>
<P>I agree with our Author, that <HI>good Order and Stability produce Strength.</HI> If Monarchy therefore excel in them, Absolute Monarchys should be of more strength than those that are limited, according to the proportion of their Riches, extent of Territory, and number of People that they go∣vern; and those limited Monarchys in the like proportion more strong than popular Governments or Commonwealths. If this be so, I wonder how a few of <HI>those giddy Greeks who,</HI> according to our Author, <HI>had learn∣ing enough only to make them seditious,</HI> came to overthrow the vast Armys of the <HI>Persians</HI> as often as they met with 'em; and seldom found any other difficulty than what arose from their own Countrymen, who sometimes sided with the Barbarians. Seditions are often rais'd by a little prating; but when one Man was to fight against fifty, or a hundred, as at the Bat∣tels of <HI>Salamis, Platea, Marathon,</HI> and others, then Industry, Wisdom, Skill and Valour were requir'd; and if their Learning had not made 'em to excel in those Vertues, they must have bin overwhelm'd by the prodi∣gious multitudes of their Enemys. This was so well known to the <HI>Persi∣ans,</HI> that when <HI>Cyrus</HI> the younger prepar'd to invade his Brother <HI>Artax∣erxes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. vit. Artax.</NOTE>he brought together indeed a vast Army of <HI>Asiaticks;</HI> but chiefly re∣lied upon the Counsel and Valour of ten thousand <HI>Grecians,</HI> whom he had engag'd to serve him. These giddy heads, accompanied with good hands, in the great Battel near <HI>Babylon,</HI> found no resistance from <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> his Army; and when <HI>Cyrus</HI> was kill'd by accident in the pursuit of the Vic∣tory they had gain'd, and their own Officers treacherously murder'd, they made good their retreat into <HI>Greece</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> in de∣spite of above four hundred thousand Horse and Foot, who endeavour'd to oppose them. They were destitute of Horse, Mony, Provisions, Friends and all other help, except what their Wisdom and Valour fur∣nish'd them; and thereupon relying, they pass'd over the Bellys of all the Enemys that ventur'd to appear against them in a march of a thousand miles. These things were perform'd in the weakness of popular confusion; but <HI>Agesilaus</HI> not being sensible of so great defects, accompanied only
<PB N="98" REF="106"/>
 with six and thirty <HI>Spartans,</HI> and such other Forces as he could raise upon his personal credit, adventur'd without Authority or Mony to undertake a War against that great King <HI>Artaxerxes;</HI> and having often beaten <HI>Phar∣nabazus</HI> and <HI>Tissaphernes</HI> his Lieutenants, was preparing to assault him in the heart of his Kingdom, when he was commanded by the <HI>Ephori</HI> to re∣turn for the defence of his own Country.</P>
<P>It may in like manner appear strange, that <HI>Alexander</HI> with the Forces of <HI>Greece,</HI> much diminish'd by the <HI>Phocean, Peloponnesian, Theban,</HI> and other intestin Wars, could overthrow all the Powers of the East, and conquer more Provinces than any other Army ever saw; if so much order and stability were to be found in absolute Monarchys, and if the Liberty in which the <HI>Grecians</HI> were educated did only fit them for Sedi∣tions: And it would seem no less astonishing, that <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> whilst they were free, should furnish such numbers of men excelling in all moral Vertues, to the admiration of all succeeding Ages; and thereby become so powerful that no Monarchs were able to resist them; and that the same Countrys since the loss of their Liberty, have always bin weak, base, cowardly and vicious, if the same Liberty had not bin the Mother and Nurse of their Vertue, as well as the root of their Power.</P>
<P>It cannot be said that <HI>Alexander</HI> was a Monarch in our Author's sense; for the power of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Kings was small. <HI>Philip</HI> confest the People were Freemen, and his Son found them to be so, when his For∣tune had overthrown his Vertue, and he fell to hate and fear that genero∣sity of Spirit which it creates. He made his Conquests by it, and lov'd it as long as he deserv'd to be lov'd. His Successors had the same fortune: When their Hearts came to be fill'd with Barbarick Pride, and to delight only in rendring men Slaves, they became weak and base, and were easily overthrown by the <HI>Romans,</HI> whose Vertue and Fortune did also perish with their Liberty. All the Nations they had to deal with, had the same fate. They never conquer'd a Free People without extreme difficulty: They receiv'd many great defeats, and were often necessitated to fight for their Lives against the <HI>Latins, Sabins, Tuscans, Samnites, Carthaginians, Spaniards;</HI> and in the height of their Power found it a hard work to subdue a few poor <HI>Etolians:</HI> But the greatest Kings were easily overcome. When <HI>Antiochus</HI> had insolently boasted that he would <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vit. Q.

The greatest danger of the War with <HI>Mithridates</HI> was to avoid his Poi∣sons and Treacherys; and to follow him thro the Deserts where he fled. When <HI>Lucullus</HI> with less than twenty thousand men had put <HI>Tigranes</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vit.

If this be not enough to prove the Falshood of our Au∣thor's Proposition, I desire it may be consider'd whether good Order or Stability be wanting in <HI>Venice:</HI> Whether <HI>Tuscany,</HI> be in a better condition to defend it self since it fell under the power of the <HI>Medices,</HI> or when it was full of free Citys: Whether it were an easy work to conquer <HI>Swit∣zerland:</HI> Whether the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are of greater strength since the recovery

of their Liberty, or when they groan'd under the Yoke of <HI>Spain:</HI> And lastly, whether the intire conquest of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Victorys obtain'd against the <HI>Hollanders</HI> when in the height of their Power, and the reputation to which <HI>England</HI> did rise in less than five years after 1648. be good marks of the instability, disorder, and weakness of free Nati∣ons: And if the contrary be true, nothing can be more absurdly false than our Author's assertion.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XII. The Glory, Vertue, and Power of the <HI>Romans</HI> began and ended with their Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>AMong many fine things propos'd by our Author, I see none more to be admir'd, or that better declares the soundness of his Judgment, than that he is only pleas'd with the beginning and end of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; and says, <HI>that their time of Liberty</HI> (between those two ex∣tremes) <HI>had nothing of good in it, but that it was of short continuance.</HI> Whereas I dare affirm that all that was ever desirable, or worthy of praise and imitation in <HI>Rome,</HI> proceeded from its Liberty, and grew up and pe∣rish'd with it: which I think will not be contradicted by any, but those who prefer the most sordid Vices before the most eminent Vertues; who believe the People to have bin more worthily employ'd by the <HI>Tarquins</HI> in cleansing Jakes and common Shores, than in acquiring the Dominion of the best part of Mankind; and account it better for a People to be op∣prest with hard labour under a proud Master, in a steril, unhealthy ten∣mile Territory, than to command all the Countrys that lie between the <HI>Fuphrates</HI> and <HI>Britain.</HI> Such Opinions will hardly find any better Patrons than <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Disciples, nor the matters of fact, as they are repre∣sented, be denied by any that know the Historys of those times. Many <HI>Romans</HI> may have had seeds of vertue in them, whilst in the insancy of that City they liv'd under Kings; but they brought forth little fruit. <HI>Tarquin,</HI> sirnam'd the Proud, being a <HI>Grecian</HI> by extraction, had perhaps observ'd that the Vertue of that Nation had render'd them averse to the Divine Government he desir'd to set up; and having by his well∣natur'd <HI>Tullia</HI> poison'd his own Brother her Husband, and his own Wife her Sister, married her, kill'd her Father, and spar'd none that he thought able to oppose his designs, to finish the work, he butcher'd the Senat, with such as seem'd most eminent among the People, and like a most pious Father endeavour'd to render the City desolate: during that time they who would not be made instruments of those Villanys, were oblig'd for their own safety to conceal their Vertues; but he being re∣mov'd, they shin'd in their Glory. Whilst he reign'd, <HI>Brutus, Vale∣rius, Horatius, Herminius, Larcius,</HI> and <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> lay hid and unre∣garded; but when they came to fight for themselves, and to imploy their Valour for the good of their Country, they gave such testimonys of Bra∣very as have bin admir'd by all succeeding ages, and settled such a Disci∣plin, as produc'd others like to them, or more excellent than they, as long as their Liberty lasted. In two hundred and sixty years that they re∣main'd under the Government of Kings, tho all of 'em, the last only ex∣cepted, were chosen by the Senat and People, and did as much to advance
<PB N="100" REF="108"/>
 the publick Service as could reasonably be expected from them, their Do∣minion hardly extended so far as from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Hownslow:</HI> But in little more than three hundred years after they recover'd their Liberty, they had subdu'd all the warlike Nations of <HI>Italy,</HI> destroy'd vast Armys of the <HI>Gauls, Cimbri,</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> overthrown the formidable power of <HI>Car∣thage,</HI> conquer'd the Cisalpine and Transalpine <HI>Gauls,</HI> with all the Nati∣ons of <HI>Spain,</HI> notwithstanding the ferocity of the one, and the more con∣stant valour of the other, with the prodigious multitudes of both: They had brought all <HI>Greece</HI> into subjection, and by the conquest of <HI>Macedon</HI> the Spoils of the World to adorn their City; and found so little difficulty in all the Wars that happen'd between them and the greatest Kings after the Death of <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Epirus</HI> and <HI>Pirrhus,</HI> that the defeats of <HI>Siphax, Perses, Antiochus, Prusias, Tigranes, Ptolomy,</HI> and many others, did hardly deserve to be number'd amongst their Victorys.</P>
<P>It were ridiculous to impute this to chance, or to think that Fortune, which of all things is the most variable, could for so many Ages continue the same course, unless supported by Vertue; or to suppose that all these Monarchys which are so much extol'd, could have bin destroy'd by that Commonwealth, if it had wanted Strength, Stability, Vertue, or good Order. The secret Counsels of God are impenetrable; but the ways by which he accomplishes his designs are often evident: When he intends to exalt a People, he fills both them and their Leaders with the Vertues suta∣ble to the accomplishment of his end; and takes away all Wisdom and Vertue from those he resolves to destroy. The Pride of the <HI>Babylonians</HI> and <HI>Assyrians</HI> fell thro the baseness of <HI>Sardanapalus;</HI> and the great City was taken while <HI>Belshazzar</HI> lay drunk amongst his Whores: The Em∣pire was transported to the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Grecians</HI> by the valour of <HI>Cyrus, Alexander,</HI> and the brave Armys that follow'd them. Historys furnish us with innumerable examples of this kind: But I think none can be found of a cowardly, weak, effeminate, foolish, ill-disciplin'd People, that have ever subdu'd such as were eminent in Strength, Wisdom, Valor, and good Disciplin; or that these qualitys have bin found or subsisted any where, unless cultivated and nourish'd by a well-order'd Govern∣ment. If this therefore was found among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and not in the Kingdoms they overthrew, they had the order and stability which the Monarchys had not; and the Strength and Vertue by which they ob∣tain'd such success, was the product of them. But if this Vertue and the glorious effects of it did begin with Liberty, it also expir'd with the same. The best men that had not fallen in Battel were glean'd up by the Proscriptions, or circumvented for the most part by false and frivo∣lous Accusations. Mankind is inclin'd to Vice, and the way to Vertue is so hard, that it wants encouragement; but when all Honours, Advanta∣ges and Preferments are given to Vice, and despis'd Vertue finds no other reward than Hatred, Persecution, and Death, there are few who will follow it. <HI>Tacitus</HI> well describes the State of the Empire, when the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tacit. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></NOTE>Power was absolutely fallen into the hands of one: <HI>Italia novis cladibus, vel post longam seculorum seriem repetitis, afflicta; Vrbs incendiis vastata, consumptis antiquissimis delubris, ipso Capitolio Civium manibus incenso; pol∣lutae ceremoniae; magna adulteria; plenum exiliis mare; infecti caedibus sco∣puli; atrocius in urbe saevitum; Nobilitas, opes, omissi vel gesti honores pro crimine, &amp; ob virtutes certissimum exitium.</HI> His following words shew, that the rewards of these abominations were not less odious than the things themselves: The highest Dignitys were bestow'd upon the <HI>Dela∣tores,</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="109"/>
who were a kind of Rogues like to our <HI>Irish</HI> Witnesses, or those that by a new coin'd word we call <HI>Trepanners.</HI> This is not a Picture drawn by a vulgar hand, but by one of the best Painters in the world; and being a Model that so much pleases our Author, 'tis good to see what it produc'd. The first fruit was such an intire degeneracy from all good, that <HI>Rome</HI> may be justly said never to have produc'd a brave Man since the first age of her Slavery. <HI>Germanicus</HI> and <HI>Corbulo</HI> were born <HI>expirante Libertate;</HI> and the recompence they receiv'd did so little encourage others to follow their example, that none have bin found in any degree like to them; and those of the most noble Familys applied themselves to sleep, laziness, and luxury, that they might not be suspected to be better than their Masters. <HI>Thraseas, Soranus,</HI> and <HI>Helvidius</HI> were worthy men, who resolv'd to persist in their Integrity, tho they should die for it; but that was the only thing that made them eminent; for they were of unknown Familys, not <HI>Romans</HI> by birth, nor ever employ'd in War: And those Emperors who did arrive to any degree of Vertue, were <HI>Spaniards, Gauls, Africans, Thracians,</HI> and of all Nations, except <HI>Romans.</HI> The Patrician and Plebeian Familys, which for many ages had fill'd the World with great Commanders, and such as excel'd in all Vertues, being thus extin∣guish'd or corrupted, the common People fell into the lowest degree of baseness: <HI>Plebs sordida Circo &amp; Theatris sueta.</HI> That People which in <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit</NOTE>magnanimity surpast all that have bin known in the World; who ne∣ver found any Enterprize above their Spirit to undertake, and Power to accomplish, with their Liberty lost all their Vigor and Vertue. They who by their Votes had dispos'd of Kingdoms and Provinces, fell to de∣sire nothing but to live and see <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Duas tantum res anxius opta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>

Whether their Emperors were good or bad, they usually rejoic'd at their Death, in hopes of getting a little Mony or Victuals from the Successor. Tho the Empire was by this means grown weak and bloodless, yet it could not fall on a sudden: So vast a Body could not die in a moment: All the neighbouring Nations had bin so much broken by their Power, that none was able to take ad∣vantage of their Weakness; and life was preserv'd by the strength of hungry Barbarians, allur'd by the greatness of the Pay they receiv'd to defend those, who had no power left to defend themselves. This preca∣rious and accidental help could not be durable. They who for a while had bin contented with their Wages, soon began to think it fit for them rather to fight for themselves, than for their weak Masters; and there∣upon fell to set up Emperors depending on themselves, or to seize upon the naked Provinces, where they found no other difficulty than to con∣tend with other Strangers, who might have the like design upon the same. Thus did the Armys of the East and West set up Emperors at their pleasure; and tho the <HI>Goths, Vandals, Huns, Sueves, Alans,</HI> and others, had cruel Wars among themselves, yet they fear'd and suffer'd little or nothing from the <HI>Romans.</HI> This state of things was so soon ob∣serv'd, that in the beginning of <HI>Tiberius</HI> his reign, they who endeavour'd to excite the <HI>Gauls</HI> to take Arms, us'd no other arguments than such as were drawn from the extreme weakness of the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quam inop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Italia, Plebs urbana imbellis, nihil in exercitibus validum praeter externum▪ <BIBL>C.

 Armys consisted of Strangers; and even the Victorys that went un∣der their name were gain'd by those Nations which in the time of their Liberty they had subdu'd. They had nothing left but Riches gather'd out of their vast Dominions; and they learn'd by their ruin, that an Em∣pire acquir'd by Vertue could not long be supported by Mony. They who by their Valour had arriv'd at such a height of Glory, Power, Greatness, and Happiness, that was never equal'd, and who in all ap∣pearance had nothing to fear from any foreign Power, could never have fallen, unless their Vertue and Disciplin had decay'd, and the corruption of their Manners excited 'em to turn their victorious Swords into their own bowels. Whilst they were in that flourishing condition, they thought they had nothing more to desire than continuance; but if our Author's judgment is to be follow'd, there was <HI>nothing of good in it, ex∣cept the shortness of its continuance;</HI> they were beholden to those who wrought the Change; they were the better for the Battels of <HI>Pharsalia, Philippi, Munda,</HI> and <HI>Actium;</HI> the destruction of two thirds of the Peo∣ple, with the slaughter of all the most eminent men among them, was for their advantage: The Proscriptions were wholsom Remedys: <HI>Tacitus</HI> did not understand the state of his own Country, when he seems to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. l. 4.</NOTE>asham'd to write the History of it, <HI>Nobis in arcto &amp; inglorius labor;</HI> when instead of such glorious things as had bin atchiev'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> whilst either the Senat, or the Common Poople prevail'd, he had nothing left to relate, but <HI>saeva jussa, continuas accusationes, fallaces amicitias, perni∣ciem innocentium:</HI> They enjoy'd nothing that was good from the expul∣sion of the <HI>Tarquins</HI> to the reestablishment of Divine absolute Monarchy in the Persons of those pious Fathers of the People, <HI>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius,</HI> &amp;c. There was no Vertue in the <HI>Junii, Horatii, Cornelii, Quintii, Decii, Manlii;</HI> but the generous and tender-hearted Princes before-mention'd were perfect examples of it: Whilst annual Magistrats govern'd, there was no stability; <HI>Sejanus, Ma∣cro</HI> and <HI>Tigellinus</HI> introduc'd good order: Vertue was not esteem'd by the antient Senat and People; <HI>Messalina, Agrippina, Poppaea, Narcissus, Pallas, Vinnius,</HI> and <HI>Laco</HI> knew how to put a just value upon it: The irregularitys of popular Assemblys, and want of Prudence in the Senat, was repair'd by the temperate proceedings of the <HI>German, Pannonian</HI> and Eastern Armys▪ or the modest discretion of the Pretorian Bands: The City was deliver'd by them from the burden of governing the World, and for its own good frequently plunder'd, fir'd; and at last, with the rest of desolated <HI>Italy,</HI> and the noblest Provinces of <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> brought under the yoke of the most barbarous and cruel Na∣tions. By the same light we may see that those who endeavour'd to per∣petuate the misery of Liberty to <HI>Rome,</HI> or lost their lives in the defence of it, were the worst or the most foolish of men, and that they were the best who did overthrow it. This rectifys all our Errors; and if the highest Praises are due to him that did the work, the next are well deserv'd by those who perish'd in attempting it: and if the Sons of <HI>Brutus,</HI> with their Companions the <HI>Vitellii</HI> and <HI>Aquillii; Claudius Appius</HI> the <HI>Decemvir;</HI> those that would have betray'd the City to <HI>Porsenna; Spurius Melius, Spur.

Power, and Happiness of <HI>Rome</HI> proceeding from Liberty, did rise, grow, and perish with it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XIII. There is disorder or prejudice in changing the name or number of Magistrats, whilst the root and principle of their Power continues intire.</HEAD>
<P>IN the next place our Author would persuade us that the <HI>Romans</HI> were inconstant, because of their changes from annual Consuls to Military Tribunes, <HI>Decemviri,</HI> and Dictators; and gives the name of Sedition to the complaints made against Usury, or the contests concerning Marriages or Magistracy: But I affirm,</P>
<P>1. That no change of Magistracy, as to the name, number, or form, dos testify irregularity, or bring any manner of prejudice, as long as it is done by those who have a right of doing it, and he or they who are created continue within the power of the Law to accomplish the end of their institution; many forms being in themselves equally good, and may be us'd as well one as another, according to times and other circum∣stances.</P>
<P>2. In the second place, 'tis a rare thing for a City at the first to be rightly constituted: Men can hardly at once foresee all that may happen in many Ages, and the changes that accompany them ought to be pro∣vided for. <HI>Rome</HI> in its foundation was subject to these defects, and the inconveniences arising from them were by degrees discover'd and reme∣di'd. They did not think of regulating Usury, till they saw the mis∣chiefs proceeding from the cruelty of Usurers; or of setting limits to the proportion of Land that one man might enjoy, till the avarice of a few had so far succeeded, that their Riches were grown formidable, and ma∣ny by the poverty to which they were reduc'd became useless to the City. It was not time to make a Law that the Plebeians might marry with the Patricians, till the distinction had rais'd the Patricians to such Pride, as to look upon themselves to have something of divine, and the others to be <HI>Inauspicati,</HI> or profane, and brought the City into danger by that divi∣sion; nor to make the Plebeians capable of being elected to the chief Magistracys, till they had men able to perform the dutys of them. But these things being observ'd, remedys were seasonably apply'd without any bloodshed or mischief, tho not without noise and wrangling.</P>
<P>3. All human Constitutions are subject to corruption, and must perish, unless timely renew'd and reduc'd to their first principles: This was chief∣ly done by means of those Tumults which our Author ignorantly blames: The whole People by whom the Magistracy had bin at first created, exe∣cuted their power in those things which comprehend Sovereignty in the highest degree, and brought every one to acknowledg it: There was no∣thing that they could not do, who first confer'd the supreme Honours up∣on the Patricians, and then made the Plebeians equal to them. Yet their Modesty was not less than their Power or Courage: and therefore when by the Law they might have made a Plebeian Consul, they did not chuse one in forty years; and when they did make use of their Right in ad∣vancing men of their own Order, they were so prudent, that they can∣not
<PB N="104" REF="112"/>
 be said to have bin mistaken in their Elections three times, whilst their Votes were free: whereas, of all the Emperors that came in by Usurpation, pretence of Blood from those who had usurp'd, or that were set up by the Soldiers, or a few Electors, hardly three can be nam'd who deserv'd that Honour, and most of them were such as seem'd to be born for Plagues to Mankind.</P>
<P>4. He manifests his fraud or ignorance in attributing the Legislative power sometimes to the Senat, and sometimes to the People; for the Se∣nat never had it. The stile of <HI>Senatus censuit, Populus jussit,</HI> was never alter'd; but the right of Advising continuing in the Senat, that of En∣acting ever continu'd in the People.</P>
<P>5. An occasion of commending absolute Power, in order to the esta∣blishment of Hereditary Monarchy, is absurdly drawn from their Cu∣stom of creating a Dictator in time of danger; for no man was ever crea∣ted, but such as seem'd able to bear so great a burden, which in hereditary Governments is wholly left to chance. Tho his Power was great, it did arise from the Law; and being confin'd to six months, 'twas almost im∣possible for any man to abuse it, or to corrupt so many of those who had enjoy'd the same honour, or might aspire to it, as to bring them for his pleasure to betray their Country: and as no man was ever chosen who had not given great testimonys of his Vertues, so no one did ever forseit the good opinion conceiv'd of him. Vertue was then honour'd, and thought so necessarily to comprehend a sincere love and fidelity to the Commonwealth, that without it the most eminent qualitys were reputed vile and odious; and the memory of former Services could no way ex∣piate the guilt of conspiring against it. This seeming Severity was in truth the greatest Clemency: for tho our Author has the impudence to say, that during the <HI>Roman Liberty the best men thriv'd worst, and the worst best,</HI> he cannot alledg one example of any eminent <HI>Roman</HI> put to death (except <HI>Manlius Capitolinus)</HI> from the expulsion of the <HI>Tarquins</HI> to the time of the <HI>Gracchi,</HI> and the Civil Wars not long after ensuing; and of very few who were banish'd. By these means Crimes were prevented; and the temptations to evil being remov'd, Treachery was destroy'd in the root; and such as might be naturally ambitious, were made to see there was no other way to Honour and Power, than by acting ver∣tuously.</P>
<P>But lest this should not be sufficient to restrain aspiring men, what Power soever was granted to any Magistrate, the Sovereignty still re∣main'd in the People, and all without exception were subject to them. This may seem strange to those who think the Dictators were absolute, because they are said to have bin <HI>sine provocatione;</HI> but that is to be only understood in relation to other Magistrats, and not to the People, as is clearly prov'd in the case of <HI>Q. Fabius,</HI> whom <HI>Papirius</HI> the Dictator <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>av. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 8.</NOTE>would have put to death: <HI>Tribunos Plebis appello,</HI> says <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> his Father, &amp; <HI>provoco ad Populum, eum{que} tibi fugienti exercitus tui, fu∣gienti Senatus Judicium, judicem sero; qui certe unus plusquam tua dicta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ura potest polletque: videro, cessurusne sis provocationi, cui Tullus Hosti∣lius cessit.</HI> And tho the People did rather intercede for <HI>Fabius</HI> than com∣mand his deliverance, that modesty did evidently proceed from an opi∣nion that <HI>Papirius</HI> was in the right; and tho they desir'd to save <HI>Fabius,</HI> who seems to have bin one of the greatest and best men that ever the Ci∣ty produc'd, they would not enervate that military Disciplin, to which they ow'd, not only their greatness, but their subsistence; most espe∣cially
<PB N="105" REF="113"/>
when their Sovereign Authority was acknowledg'd by all, and the Dictator himself had submitted. This right of Appeals to the People was the foundation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Commonwealth, laid in the days of <HI>Ro∣mulus,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv. l. 1.</NOTE>submitted to by <HI>Hostilius</HI> in the case of <HI>Horatius,</HI> and never vio∣lated, till the Laws and the Liberty which they supported were over∣thrown by the power of the Sword. This is confirm'd by the speech of <HI>Metellus</HI> the Tribune, who in the time of the second <HI>Carthaginian</HI> War, causelesly disliking the Proceedings of <HI>Q. Fabius Maximus</HI> then Dictator, in a publick Assembly of the People said, <HI>Quod si antiquus animus Plebi</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv. l. 22.</NOTE><HI>Romanae esset, se audacter laturum de abrogando Q. Fabii Imperio; nunc mo∣dicam rogationem promulgaturum, de aequando Magistri Equitum &amp; Dicta∣toris jure:</HI> which was done, and that Action, which had no precedent, shews that the People needed none, and that their Power being eminent∣ly above that of all Magistrats, was oblig'd to no other rule than that of their own Will. Tho I do therefore grant that a Power like to the Dic∣tatorian, limited in time, circumscrib'd by Law, and kept perpetually under the supreme Authority of the People, may, by vertuous and well∣disciplin'd Nations, upon some occasions, be prudently granted to a ver∣tuous man, it can have no relation to our Author's Monarch, whose Power is in himself, subject to no Law, perpetually exercis'd by himself, and for his own sake, whether he has any of the abilitys requir'd for the due performance of so great a work, or be intirely destitute of them; no∣thing being more unreasonable than to deduce consequences from cases, which in substance and circumstances are altogether unlike: but to the contrary, these examples shewing that the <HI>Romans,</HI> even in the time of such Magistrats as seem'd to be most absolute, did retain and exercise the Sovereign Power, do most evidently prove that the Government was ever the same remaining in the People, who without prejudice might give the Administration to one or more men as best pleas'd themselves, and the success shews that they did it prudently.</P>

<P>LIttle pains is requir'd to confute our Author, who imputes much bloodshed to the popular Government of <HI>Rome;</HI> for he cannot prove that one man was unjustly put to death, or slain in any Sedition before <HI>Publius Gracchus:</HI> The Foundations of the Commonwealth were then so shaken, that the Laws could not be executed; and whatsoever did then fall out, ought to be attributed to the Monarchy for which the great Men began to contend. Whilst they had no other Wars than with neighboring Nations, they had a strict eye upon their Commanders, and could preserve Disciplin among the Soldiers: but when by the excellence of their Valour and Conduct the greatest Powers of the World were subdu'd, and for the better carrying on of foreign Wars, Armys were suffer'd to continue in the same hands longer than the Law did direct, Soldiery came to be ac∣counted a Trade, and those who had the worst designs against the Com∣monwealth, began to savour all manner of Licentiousness and Rapine, that they might gain the savour of the Legions, who by that means be∣came

 unruly and seditious; 'twas hard, if not impossible, to preserve a Civil equality, when the Spoils of the greatest Kingdoms were brought to adorn the Houses of private men; and they who had the greatest Ci∣tys and Nations to be their Dependents and Clients, were apt to scorn the power of the Law. This was a most dangerous Disease, like those to which human Bodys are subject, when arriv'd to that which Physicians call the Athletick habit, proceeding from the highest perfection of Health, Activity and Strength, that the best Constitution by Diet and Exercise can attain. Whosoever falls into them shews that he had attain'd that perfection; and he who blames that which brings a State into the like condition, condemns that which is most perfect among men. Whilst the <HI>Romans</HI> were in the way to this, no Sedition did them any hurt: they were compos'd without Blood; and those that seem'd to be the most dan∣gerous, produc'd the best Laws. But when they were arriv'd to that condition, no Order could do them good; the fatal period set to human things was come, they could go no higher,

All men were ever subject to error, and it may be said that the mistaken People in the space of about three hundred years did unjustly fine or banish five or six men; but those mistakes were so frankly acknowledg'd, and carefully repair'd by Honours bestow'd upon the injur'd Persons, as appears by the Examples of <HI>Camillus, Livius Sali∣nator, Paulus Emylius,</HI> and others, that they deserve more praise than if they had not fail'd.</P>
<P>If for the above-mention'd time Seditions were harmless or profitable, they were also absolutely exempted from Civil Wars. Those of <HI>Apulia</HI> and <HI>Greece</HI> were Revolts of conquer'd Nations, and can no way fall un∣der that name: But 'tis most absurdly apply'd to the servile and gladiato∣rian Wars; for the Gladiators were Slaves also, and Civil Wars can be made only by those who are Members of the Civil Society, which Slaves are not. Those that made the <HI>bellum Sociale,</HI> were Freemen, but not Ci∣tizens; and the War they made could not be call'd Civil. The <HI>Romans</HI> had three ways of dealing with conquer'd Nations.</P>
<P>1. Some were receiv'd into the body of the City, <HI>Civitate donati,</HI> as the <HI>Latins</HI> by <HI>Romulus;</HI> the <HI>Albans</HI> by <HI>Hostilius;</HI> the <HI>Privernates</HI> when their Ambassador declar'd, that no Peace could be durable unless it were just and easy; and the Senat said, <HI>Se viri &amp; liberi vocem audivisse, ta∣les{que} dignos esse ut Romani siant;</HI> and the like Favour was shown to many others.</P>
<P>2. By making Leagues with them, as <HI>Livy</HI> says, <HI>Populum Romanum devictos bello populos, malle societate &amp; amicitia habere conjunctos, quam tri∣sti subjectos servitio:</HI> Of which sort were the <HI>Samnites,</HI> who not liking their condition, join'd with <HI>Hannibal;</HI> and afterwards, under the conduct of the brave <HI>Telesinus,</HI> with other Nations that liv'd under the condition of <HI>Socii,</HI> made an unprosperous attempt to deliver themselves.</P>
<P>3. Those who after many Rebellions were <HI>in Provinciam redacti,</HI> as the <HI>Capuans,</HI> when their City was taken by <HI>Appius Claudius,</HI> and <HI>Q. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣vius Flaccus.</HI></P>
<P>We osten hear of Wars made by those of the two latter sorts; but of none that can be call'd Civil, till the times of <HI>Marius, Sylla,</HI> and <HI>Catiline:</HI> and as they are to be esteem'd the last Struglings of expiring Liberty,
<PB N="107" REF="115"/>
when the Laws, by which it had subsisted, were enervated; so those that happen'd between <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Pompey, Octavius</HI> and <HI>Antonius,</HI> with the Proscriptions, Triumvirate, and all the Mischiefs that accompany'd them, are to be imputed wholly to the Monarchy for which they con∣tended, as well as those between <HI>Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius,</HI> and <HI>Ves∣pasian,</HI> that hardly ever ceas'd till the Empire was abolish'd; for the name of a Commonwealth continu'd to the end; and I know not why <HI>Tiberius</HI> or <HI>Nero</HI> might not use it as well as <HI>Sylla</HI> or <HI>Marius.</HI></P>
<P>Yet if our Author be resolv'd to impute to Popular Government all that pass'd before <HI>Cesar</HI> made himself perpetual Dictator, he will find no more than is seen in all places. We have known few small States, and no great one free from Revolts of Subjects or Allies; and the greatest Empire of the East was overthrown by the rebellion of the <HI>Mammalukes</HI> their Slaves. If there is any difference to be observ'd between what happen'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> 'tis chiefly, that whilst there was any shadow of Liberty, the Slaves, Gladiators, Subjects or Allies, were always beaten and suppress'd; whereas in the time of the Emperors, the Revolt of a Province was sufficient to give a new Master to the best part of Mankind; and he having no more power than was requir'd for a present Mischief, was for the most part, in a short time, destroy'd by another. But to please our Author, I will acknowledg a second defect, even that Wantonness to which he ascribes all their Disorders; tho I must withal desire him to consider from whence Wantonness dos proceed. If the People of <HI>Turky</HI> or <HI>France</HI> did rebel, I should think they were driven to it by Misery, Beggery, or Despair; and could lay Wantonness only to the charge of those who enjoy much Prosperity. Nations that are opprest and made miserable, may fall into Rage, but can never grow wanton. In the time of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, the Pretorian Cohorts, or the Armys that had the liberty of ravaging the richest Provinces, might be proud of their Strength, or grow wanton thro the abundance of their Enjoyments: The Janizarys in later Ages may, for the same reasons, have fallen into the like excesses; but such as have lost their Liberty are in no danger of them. When all the Nobility of <HI>Rome</HI> was destroy'd, and those who excel'd in Reputation or Vertue, were fallen in the Wars, or by the Pro∣scriptions; when two thirds of the People were slain, the best Citys and Colonys burnt, the Provinces exhausted, and the small remains left in them opprest with a most miserable slavery, they may have revolted, and sometimes did, as the <HI>Britans, Batavians,</HI> and others mention'd in the <HI>Roman</HI> History: But they were driven to those Revolts by Fury and Necessity, arising from the Miserys and Indignitys they suffer'd under an insupportable Tyranny; and Wantonness had no part in them. The People of <HI>Rome,</HI> when they were a little freed from the Terror of the Soldiers, did sometimes for the same reasons conspire against the Empe∣rors; and when they could do no more, exprest their hatred by breaking their Statues: But after the Battels of <HI>Pharsalia, Philippi,</HI> and the Pro∣scriptions, they never committed any folly thro Wantonness. In the like manner <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> have revolted within these few years; and some who are well acquainted with the State of those Kingdoms, think them ready again to do the like: but if it should so happen, no man of un∣derstanding would impute it to Wantonness. The Pressures under which they groan, have cur'd 'em of all such Diseases; and the <HI>Romans</HI> after the loss of their Liberty could never fall into them. They may have grown wanton when their Authority was reverenc'd, their Vertue ad∣mir'd,
<PB N="108" REF="116"/>
 their Power irresistible, and the Riches of the World were flow∣ing in upon them, as it were, to corrupt their Manners, by inticing them to pleasure. But when all that was lost, and they found their Persons expos'd to all manner of Violence from the basest of men; their Riches exhausted by Tributes and Rapine, whilst the Treasures of the Empire were not sufficient to supply the Luxury of their Masters: the misery they suffer'd, and the shame of suffering it, with the contemptible weakness to which they were reduc'd, did too strongly admonish them that the Vices of Wantonness belong'd only to those who enjoy'd a Condition far different from theirs; and the memory of what they had lost, sharpned the sense of what they felt. This is the state of things which pleases our Author; and, by praising that Government, which depriv'd those who were under it of all that is most desirable in the world, and introduc'd all that ought to be detested, he sufficiently shews that he delights only in that which is most abominable, and would introduce his admir'd Abso∣lute Monarchy, only as an Instrument of bringing Vice, Misery, De∣vastation and Infamy upon Mankind.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XV. The Empire of <HI>Rome</HI> perpetually decay'd when it fell into the hands of one Man.</HEAD>
<P>IN pursuance of his Design our Author, with as much Judgment as Truth, denies that <HI>Rome</HI> became Mistress of the World under the Popular Government: <HI>It is not so,</HI> says he, <HI>for</HI> Rome <HI>began her Empire under Kings, and did perfect it under Emperors: It did only increase under that Popularity: Her greatest exaltation was under</HI> Trajan, <HI>and longest Peace under</HI> Augustus. For the illustration of which, I desire these few things may be consider'd.</P>
<P>1. That the first Monarchy of <HI>Rome</HI> was not absolute: The Kings were made by the People without regard to any Man's Title, or other rea∣son than the common Good, chusing him that seem'd most likely to procure it; setting up at the same time a Senat consisting of a hundred of the most eminent Men among them; and, after the reception of the <HI>Sabins</HI> into the City, adding as many more to them, and committing the principal part of the Government to their care, retaining the power of making those Laws to which the Kings who reign'd by their Command were sub∣ject, and reserving to themselves the Judgment of all great Matters upon Appeal. If any of their Kings deserv'd to be call'd a Monarch, according to <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Definition, it was the last <HI>Tarquin;</HI> for he alone of all their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. l. 2.</NOTE>Kings reign'd not <HI>jussu Populi,</HI> but came in by Treachery and Murder. If he had continu'd, he had cur'd the People of all Vices proceeding from Wantonness; but his farthest Conquest was of the small Town of <HI>Gabii</HI> ten miles distant from <HI>Rome,</HI> which he effected by the fraud of his detesta∣ble Son; and that being then the utmost limit of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, must deserve to be call'd the World, or the Empire of it was not gain'd by their Kings.</P>
<P>2. The Extent of Conquests is not the only, nor the chief thing that ought to be consider'd in them; regard is to be had to the Means whereby they are made, and the Valour or Force that was employ'd by the Ene∣my.
<PB N="109" REF="117"/>
In these respects not only the overthrow of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and the Con∣quests of <HI>Spain,</HI> but the Victorys gain'd against the <HI>Sabins, Latins, Tus∣cans, Samnites,</HI> and other valiant Nations of <HI>Italy,</HI> who most obstinately defended their Liberty, when the <HI>Romans</HI> had no Forces but their own, shew more Vertue, and deserve incomparably more Praise, than the De∣feats of any Nations whatsoever, when they were increas'd in Number, Riches, Reputation and Power, and had many other warlike People iustruc∣ted in their Disciplin, and fighting under their Ensigns. But I deny that the <HI>Romans</HI> did ever make any considerable acquisition after the loss of their Liberty. They had already subdu'd all <HI>Italy, Greece, Macedon,</HI> the Islands of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, <HI>Thracia, Illyrium, Asia</HI> the Less, <HI>Pontus, Armenia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, Gaul</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> The Forces of <HI>Germany</HI> were broken; a Bridg laid over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and all the Countrys on this side subdu'd. This was all that was ever gain'd by the Valour of their own Forces, and that could bring either Honour or Profit. But I know of no Conquest made after that time, unless the name of Conquest be gi∣ven to <HI>Caligula</HI>'s Expedition, when he said he had subdu'd the Sea, in making an useless Bridg from <HI>Puteoli</HI> to <HI>Baiae;</HI> or that of the other Fool, who enter'd <HI>Rome</HI> in triumph, for having gather'd shells on the Sea∣shore. <HI>Trajan</HI>'s Expedition into the East, was rather a Journy than a War: He rambled over the Provinces that <HI>Augustus</HI> had abandon'd as not worth keeping, and others that had nothing to defend them, but ill∣arm'd and unwarlike Barbarians: Upon the whole matter, he seems to have bin led only by Curiosity; and the vanity of looking upon them as Conquests, appears in their being relinquish'd as soon as gain'd. <HI>Britain</HI> was easily taken from a naked and unskilful, tho a brave People; hardly kept, and shamefully lost. But tho the Emperors had made greater Wars than the Commonwealth, vanquish'd Nations of more valour and skill than their <HI>Italian</HI> Neighbours, the <HI>Grecians</HI> or <HI>Carthaginians;</HI> sub∣du'd and slaughter'd those that in Numbers and Ferocity had exceeded the <HI>Cimbri, Gauls</HI> and <HI>Teutons,</HI> encounter'd Captains more formidable than <HI>Pirrhus</HI> and <HI>Hannibal,</HI> it might indeed increase the Glory of him that should have done it, but could add nothing of Honour or Advantage to the <HI>Roman</HI> Name: The Nobility was extirpated long before, the People corrupted and enslav'd, <HI>Italy</HI> lay desolate, so as a <HI>Roman</HI> was hardly to be found in a <HI>Roman</HI> Army, which was generally compos'd of such, as fight∣ing for themselves or their Commander, never thought of any thing less than the Interest of <HI>Rome.</HI> And as it is impossible that what is so neglected and betray'd, should be durable, that Empire which was acquir'd by the Valour and Conduct of the bravest and best disciplin'd People of the World, decay'd and perish'd in the hands of those Absolute Monarchs who ought to have preserv'd it.</P>
<P>3. Peace is desirable by a State that is constituted for it, who contenting themselves with their own Territorys, have no desires of enlarging them: Or perhaps it might simply deserve praise, if Mankind were so fram'd, that a People intending hurt to none, could preserve themselves; but the World being so far of another temper, that no Nation can be safe without Valour and Strength, those Governments only deserve to be commended, which by Disciplin and Exercise increase both, and the <HI>Roman</HI> above all, that excel'd in both. Peace therefore may be good in its season, and was so in <HI>Numa</HI>'s Reign; yet two or three such Kings would have encou∣rag'd some active Neighbours to put an end to that aspiring City, be∣fore its Territory had extended beyond <HI>Fidenae.</HI> But the Disciplin that
<PB N="110" REF="118"/>
 best agreed with the Temper and Designs of a Warlike People, being renew'd by his brave Successors, the Dangers were put on their Enemys; and all of them, the last only excepted, persisting in the same way, did reasonably well perform their Duty. When they were remov'd, and the Affairs of the City depended no longer upon the Temper or Capacity of one Man, the ends for which the City was constituted were vigorously pursu'd, and such Magistrats annually chosen, as would not long continue in a universal Peace, till they had gotten the Empire to which they aspir'd, or were by ill Fortune brought to such weakness, as to be no longer able to make War. Both of these happen'd in the so much magnify'd Reign of <HI>Augustus.</HI> He found the Empire so great, that all Additions might rationally be rejected as useless or prejudicial; and <HI>Italy</HI> so exhausted, that Wars could only be carry'd on by the strength of Strangers: It was time to lie still when they had no power to act; and they might do it safely, whilst the Reputation gain'd by former Victorys preserv'd them from Foreign Invasions. When <HI>Crassus, Pompey,</HI> and <HI>Cesar,</HI> who had torn the Commonwealth into three Monarchys, were kill'd, and the Flower of the <HI>Roman</HI> Nobility and People destroy'd with them, or by them: When <HI>Cato</HI>'s Vertue had prov'd too weak to support a falling State, and <HI>Brutus</HI> with <HI>Cassius</HI> had perish'd in their noble Attempt to restore their Liberty: When the best part of the Senat had bin expos'd for a Prey to the Vulturs and Wolves of <HI>Thessaly,</HI> and one hundred and thirty of those who de∣serv'd the hatred of Tyrants, and had escap'd the fury of War, had bin destroy'd by the Proscriptions: When neither Captains nor Soldiers remain'd in the desolate City; when the Tyrant abhor'd and fear'd all those who had either Reputation or Vertue, and by the most subtil Arts endeavour'd so to corrupt or break the Spirits of the remaining People, that they might not think of their former Greatness, or the ways of re∣covering it, we ought not to wonder that they ceas'd from War. But such a Peace is no more to be commended, than that which Men have in the Grave; as in the Epitaph of the Marquess <HI>Trivultio</HI> seen at <HI>Milan, Qui nunquam quievit, quiescit, tace.</HI> This Peace is in every Wilderness: The Turks have establish'd it in the empty Provinces of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Greece.</HI> Where there are no men, or if those men have no Courage, there can be no War. Our Ancestors the <HI>Britans</HI> observ'd, that the Peace which in that Age the <HI>Romans</HI> establish'd in the Provinces, consisted in the most <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit.</NOTE>wretched slavery and solitude: <HI>Miserrimam servitutem pacem appellant.</HI> And in another place, <HI>Solitudinem faciunt, pacem vocant.</HI> This is the Peace the <HI>Spaniards</HI> settled in their Dominions of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> by the destruction of above <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Barth. de las Casas, de∣struy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. de las Indias.</NOTE>forty millions of Souls. The Countrys were ve∣ry quiet, when wild Beasts only were left to fight in them, or a few mi∣serable Wretches, who had neither strength nor courage to resist their violence. This was the Peace the <HI>Romans</HI> enjoy'd under <HI>Augustus:</HI> A few of those who made themselves subservient to his Pleasure, and Mini∣sters of the publick Calamitys, were put into a flourishing condition; but the rest pin'd, wither'd, and never recover'd. If yet our Author will have us to think the Liberty and People of <HI>Rome</HI> oblig'd to <HI>Augustus,</HI> who procur'd such a Peace for them, he ought to remember that besides what they suffer'd in settling it, they paid dear for it even in the future; for <HI>Italy</HI> was thereby so weaken'd, as never to recover any strength or ver∣tue to desend it self; but depending absolutely upon barbarous Nations, or Armys compos'd of them, was ravag'd and torn in pieces by every In∣vader.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="119"/>
4. That Peace is only to be valu'd which is accompany'd with Justice; and those Governments only deserve praise, who put the Power into the hands of the best Men. This was wholly wanting during the Reigns of <HI>Augustus</HI> and his Successors. The worst of men gain'd the Sovereignty by Alliance, Fraud, or Violence, and advanc'd such as most resembled themselves. <HI>Augustus</HI> was worse in the beginning than in the latter end of his Reign; but his bloody and impure Successor grew every day more wicked as long as he liv'd: Whilst he sat upon the Rocks at <HI>Capreae</HI> with his <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> he meditated nothing but Lust or Mischief, and had <HI>Sejanus</HI> and <HI>Macro</HI> always ready to execute his detestable Designs. <HI>Cali∣gula</HI> could find none equal to himself in all manner of Villanys; but sa∣vour'd those most who were likest to him. <HI>Claudius</HI> his stupidity, drun∣kenness, and subjection to the fury of two impudent Strumpets, and manumis'd Slaves, prov'd as hurtful to the Empire, as the savage fury of his Predecessor. Tho <HI>Nero</HI> was a Monster that the World could not bear, yet the raging Soldiers kill'd <HI>Galba,</HI> and gave the Empire to <HI>Otho</HI> for no other reason, than that he had bin the Companion of his De∣bauches, and of all men was thought most to resemble him. With them all Evils came in like a Flood; and their Successors finding none so bad as themselves, but the Favorites, Whores and Slaves that govern'd them, would suffer no Vertue to grow up; and fill'd the City with a base, leud, and miserable Rabble, that car'd for nothing beyond Stage-plays and Bread. Such a People could not be seditious; but <HI>Rome</HI> had bin deso∣late, if they had not thus fill'd it. And tho this temper and condition of a People may please our Author; yet it was an incurable Wound to the State, and in consequence to the best part of the World.</P>
<P>When the City had bin burnt by the <HI>Gauls,</HI> it was soon restor'd: The Defeats of <HI>Ticinum, Trebia, Thrasimene,</HI> and <HI>Cannae,</HI> were repair'd with equal or greater Victorys: The War of the Allies ended in their over∣throw: The Fury of the Gladiators was extinguish'd with their Blood: The Commonwealth lost Battels, but was never conquer'd in any War: and in the end triumph'd over all that had contended with them. Whilst Liberty continu'd, it was the Nurse of Vertue; and all the Losses suf∣fer'd in Foreign or Civil Wars, were easily recover'd: but when Liber∣ty was lost, Valour and Vertue was torn up by the roots, and the <HI>Roman</HI> Power proceeding from it, perish'd.</P>
<P>I have not dwelt so long upon this point to expose the folly of our Au∣thor, but to show that the abovemention'd Evils did proceed from a per∣manent cause, which will always produce the like effects; and Historys testify, that it has done the same in all places. <HI>Carthage</HI> was rebuilt, af∣ter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had bin destroy'd by <HI>Scipio,</HI> and continu'd to be a rich City for al∣most a thousand years, but produc'd no such Men as <HI>Amilcar, Asdrubal</HI> and <HI>Hannibal: Cleomenes</HI> and <HI>Euclidas</HI> were the last that deserv'd to be call'd <HI>Spartans: Athens</HI> never had an eminent Man, after it felt the weight of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Yoke, and <HI>Philopemen</HI> was the last of the <HI>Achaians.</HI> Tho the Commonwealths of <HI>Italy</HI> in later Ages, having too much apply'd themselves to the acquisition of Mony, wanted that greatness of Spirit which had reign'd in their Ancestors, yet they have not bin without Valour and Vertue. That of <HI>Pisa</HI> was famous for Power at Sea, till the <HI>Genoeses</HI> overthrew them. <HI>Florence</HI> had a brave Nobility, and a stout People. <HI>Arezzo, Pistoia, Cortona, Sienna,</HI> and other small Towns of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> were not without strength, tho for the most part unhappily ex∣ercis'd in the Factions of <HI>Ghibelins</HI> and <HI>Guelphs, Neri</HI> and <HI>Bianchi,</HI> that
<PB N="112" REF="120"/>
 divided all <HI>Italy;</HI> but since the introduction of <HI>Filmer</HI>'s divine Absolute Monarchy, all Power, Vertue, Reputation and Strength, are utterly perish'd from among them, and no man dares to oppose the publick Mis∣chiefs. They usually decide private Quarrels by Assassination or Poison; and in other respects they enjoy the happiness of that Peace which is al∣ways found within empty Walls and desolated Countrys: And if this be according to the Laws of God and Nature, it cannot be deny'd, that Weakness, Baseness, Cowardice, Destruction and Desolation are so likewise. These are the Blessings our well-natur'd Author would confer upon us; but if they were to be esteem'd so, I cannot tell why those that felt them, com∣plain'd so much of 'em. <HI>Tacitus</HI> reciting what past in his time, and somewhat before (for want of a Christian Spirit) in the bitterness of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Tacit. l. 1.</NOTE>his Soul says, <HI>Nec unquam atrocioribus Populi Romani cladibus, magisque justis indiciis probatum est, non esse curae Deis securitatem nostram esse ultio∣nem.</HI> Some thought that no Punishments could be justly deserv'd by a People that had so much favour'd Vertue; others, that even the Gods they ador'd, envied their Felicity and Glory; but all confess'd they were fallen from the highest pitch of human Happiness into the lowest degree of Infamy and Misery: And our Author being the first that ever found they had gain'd by the change, we are to attribute the discovery of so great a Spirit to the excellency of his Wisdom. If, suspending my Judgment in this point, till it be prov'd by better Authority than his word, I in the mean time follow the opinion of those who think Slavery dos naturally produce meanness of Spirit, with its worst effect, flattery, which <HI>Tacitus</HI> calls <HI>foedum servitutis crimen;</HI> I must believe, that the Im∣pudence of carrying it to such a height, as to commend nothing in the most glorious Liberty, that made the most vertuous People in the world, but the shortness of its continuance, and to prefer the Tyran∣ny of the basest of Men, or worst of Monsters, is peculiar to <HI>Filmer;</HI> and that their wickedness, which had never bin equal'd, is surpast by him, who recommends as the Ordinance of God, the Principles that cer∣tainly produce them.</P>
<P><HI>But,</HI> says our Author, <HI>tho</HI> Rome <HI>was for a while miraculously upheld in Glory by a greater Prudence than its own, yet in a short time, after manifold Alterations, she was ruin'd by her own hand.</HI> But 'tis absurd to say, that the overthrow of a Government, which had nothing of good in it, can be a ruin; or that the Glory in which it continu'd, had nothing of good in it; and most of all, that it could be ruin'd by no hands but its own, if that Glory had not bin gain'd, and immediately or instrumentally supported by such vertue and strength as is worthily to be prefer'd before all other temporal Happiness, and dos ever produce it. This shews that Liars ought to have good memorys. But passing over such foolish Contradicti∣ons, I desire to know, how that <HI>Prudence, greater than its own</HI> (which till I am better inform'd, I must think to be inseparably united to Justice and Goodness) came miraculously to support a Government, which was not only evil in it self, as contrary to the Laws of God and Nature; but so perpetually bent against that Monarchy, which he says is according to them, as to hate all Monarchs, despise all that would live under them, destroy as many of them as came within their reach; and make a Law by which any man was authoris'd to kill him, who should endeavour to set up this Divine Power among them. Moreover, no human Prudence pre∣serv'd the Roman Glory but their own: the others directly set themselves to oppose it, and the most eminent fell under it. We know of no Pru∣dence
<PB N="113" REF="121"/>
surpassing the human, unless it be the Divine: But the Divine Prudence did never miraculously exert it self, except to bear witness to the Truth, and to give authority to those that announc'd it. If therefore the Glory of this Popular Government was miraculously supported by a more than human Prudence, it was good in it self; the Miracles done in favour of it did testify it, and all that our Author says against it is false and abominable.</P>
<P>If I lay aside the word <HI>Miraculous,</HI> as put in by chance, 'twill be hard to know how God (who in the usual course of his Providence guides all things by such a gentle and undiscern'd Power, that they seem to go on of themselves) should give such vertue to this popular Government, and the Magistrats bred up under it, that the greatest Monarchs of the Earth were as dust before them, unless there had bin an excellency in their Disciplin, far surpassing that of their Enemys; or how that can be call'd ill in its Principle, and said to comprehend no good, which God did so gloriously support, and no man was ever able to resist. This can∣not be better answer'd than by our Author's Citation, <HI>Suis &amp; ipsa Roma viribus ruit;</HI> That City which had overthrown the greatest Powers of the World must, in all appearance, have lasted for ever, if their Vertue and Disciplin had not decay'd, or their Forces bin turn'd against them∣selves. If our Author therefore say true, the greatest good that ever be∣fel the <HI>Romans,</HI> was the decay of their Vertue and Disciplin; and the turning of their own Arms against themselves, was not their Ruin but their Preservation.</P>
<P>When they had brought the warlike Nations of <HI>Italy</HI> into subjection, or association; often represt the fury of the <HI>Gauls, Cimbri</HI> and <HI>Teutons;</HI> overthrown the Wealth, Power and Wit of <HI>Carthage,</HI> supported by the Skill, Industry and Valour of <HI>Hannibal</HI> and his brave Relations; almost extirpated the valiant <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who would no other way be subdu'd; defeated <HI>Philip, Perses, Antiochus, Gentius, Syphax</HI> and <HI>Jugurtha;</HI> struck an aw into <HI>Ptolomy;</HI> avoided the snares and poisons of <HI>Mithridates;</HI> fol∣low'd him in his Flights, reveng'd his Treacherys, and carry'd their vic∣torious Arms beyond his conquer'd Kingdoms to the Banks of <HI>Tygris:</HI> When neither the Revolt of their <HI>Italian</HI> Associats, nor the Rebellion of their Slaves led by <HI>Spartacus</HI> (who in skill seems to have bin equal to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> and above him in Courage) could put a stop to their Victorys: When <HI>Greece</HI> had bin reduc'd to yield to a Vertue rather than a Power greater than their own, we may well say that Government was suppor∣ted by a more than human prudence, which led them thro Vertue to a height of Glory, Power and Happiness, that till that day had bin un∣known to the World, and could never have bin ruin'd, if by the decay of that Vertue they had not turn'd their victorious Arms against them∣selves. That City was a Giant that could die by no other hand than his own; like <HI>Hercules</HI> poison'd and driven into madness, after he had de∣stroy'd Thieves, Monsters and Tyrants, and found nothing on the Earth able to resist him. The wisest of men in antient times, looking upon this as a point of more than human Perfection, thought or feign'd to think, that he was descended from the Gods, and at his death receiv'd into their number, tho perhaps <HI>Filmer</HI> would prefer a weak, base and effeminate Slave before him. The matter will not be much different, if we adhere to the foremention'd similitude of the <HI>Athletick Habit;</HI> for the danger proceeds only from the perfection of it, and he who dislikes it, must commend that Weakness and Vice which may perish, but can ne∣ver

 be chang'd into any thing worse than it self, as those that lie upon the ground can never fall. However this Fall of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which our Author, speaking truth against his will, calls their Ruin, was into that which he recommends as the Ordinance of God: Which is as much as to say, that they were ruin'd when they fell from their own unnatural In∣ventions to follow the Law of God and of Nature; that Luxury also thro which they fell, was the product of their Felicity; and that the Na∣tions that had bin subdu'd by them, had no other way of avenging their Defeats, than by alluring their Masters to their own Vices: This was the Root of their Civil Wars. When that proud City found no more resi∣stance, it grew <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Saevior armis</L>
<L>Luxuria incubuit, victum{que} ulciscitur orbem. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE> wanton. Honest Poverty became uneasy, when Ho∣nours were given to ill-gotten Riches. This was so Monarchical, that a People infected with such a Custom must needs fall by it. They who by Vice had exhausted their Fortunes, could repair them only by bringing their Country under a Government that would give impunity to Rapine; and such as had not Vertues to deserve Advancement from the Senat and Peo∣ple, would always endeavour to set up a Man that would bestow the Honours due to Vertue, upon those who would be most abjectly subser∣vient to his Will and Interests. When mens minds are fill'd with this Fury, they sacrifice the common Good to the advancement of their pri∣vate Concernments. This was the temper of <HI>Catiline</HI> exprest by <HI>Sallust,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sallust. Bell. Catilin.</NOTE><HI>Luxuria principi gravis, paupertas vix à privato toleranda;</HI> and this put him upon that desperate extremity to say, <HI>Incendium meum ruinâ extin∣guam.</HI> Others in the same manner being fill'd with the same rage, he could not want Companions in his most villanous Designs. 'Tis not long since a Person of the highest Quality, and no less famous for Learning and Wit, having observ'd the State of <HI>England,</HI> as it stood not many years ago, and that to which it has bin reduc'd since the year sixty, as is thought very much by the Advice and Example of <HI>France,</HI> said, That they were now taking a most cruel Vengeance upon us for all the Over∣throws receiv'd from our Ancestors, by introducing their most damna∣ble Maxims, and teaching us the worst of their Vices. 'Tis not for me to determin whether this Judgment was rightly made or not; for I intend not to speak of our Affairs: but all Historians agreeing, that the change of the <HI>Roman</HI> Government was wrought by such means as I have mention'd; and our Author acknowledging that change to have bin their ruin, as in truth it was, I may justly conclude, that the overthrow of that Government could not have bin a ruin to them, but good for them, unless it had bin good; and that the Power which did ruin it, and was set up in the room of it, cannot have bin according to the Laws of God or Nature, for they confer only that which is good, and destroy nothing that is so; but must have bin most contrary to that good which was over∣thrown by it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVI. The best Governments of the World have bin compos'd of Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's cavils concerning I know not what vulgar Opinions that Democracys were introduc'd to curb Tyranny, deserve no an∣swer; for our question is, Whether one form of Government be pre∣scrib'd to us by God and Nature, or we are left according to our own un∣derstanding, to constitute such as seem best to our selves. As for Demo∣cracy, he may say what pleases him of it; and I believe it can sute only with the convenience of a small Town, accompany'd with such Circum∣stances as are seldom sound. But this no way obliges men to run into the other extreme, in as much as the variety of Forms between mere Demo∣cracy and Absolute Monarchy is almost infinite: And if I should under∣take to say, there never was a good Government in the world, that did not consist of the three simple Species of Monarchy, Aristocracy and Democracy, I think I might make it good. This at the least is certain, that the Government of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> instituted by God, had a Judg, the great <HI>Sanhedrin,</HI> and General Assemblys of the People: <HI>Sparta</HI> had two Kings, a Senat of twenty eight chosen Men, and the like Assemblys: All the <HI>Dorian</HI> Citys had a chief Magistrat, a Senat, and occasional Assem∣blys: The <HI>Ionian, Athens,</HI> and others, had an <HI>Archon,</HI> the <HI>Areopagi;</HI> and all Judgments concerning matters of the greatest importance, as well as the Election of Magistrats, were refer'd to the People. <HI>Rome</HI> in the be∣ginning had a King and a Senat, whilst the Election of Kings, and Judg∣ments upon Appeals remain'd in the People; afterwards Consuls repre∣senting Kings, and vested with equal Power, a more numerous Senat, and more frequent meetings of the People. <HI>Venice</HI> has at this day a Duke, the Senat of the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and the Great Assembly of the Nobility, which is the whole City, the rest of the Inhabitants being only <HI>Incolae,</HI> not <HI>Cives;</HI> and those of the other Citys or Countrys are their Subjects, and do not participate of the Government. <HI>Genoa</HI> is govern'd in like man∣ner: <HI>Luca</HI> not unlike to them. <HI>Germany</HI> is at this day govern'd by an Emperor, the Princes or great Lords in their several Precincts, the Citys by their own Magistrats, and by general Diets, in which the whole Pow∣er of the Nation resides, and where the Emperor, Princes, Nobility, and Citys have their places in person, or by their Deputys. All the Nor∣thern Nations, which upon the dissolution of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire possest the best Provinces that had compos'd it, were under that form which is usually call'd the <HI>Gothick</HI> Polity: They had King, Lords, Commons, Diets, Assemblys of Estates, Cortez, and Parliaments, in which the So∣vereign Powers of those Nations did reside, and by which they were exer∣cis'd. The like was practis'd in <HI>Hungary, Bohemia, Sweden, Denmark, Poland;</HI> and if things are chang'd in some of these places within a few years, they must give better proofs of having gain'd by the change than are yet seen in the World, before I think my self oblig'd to change my opinion.</P>
<P>Some Nations not liking the name of King, have given such a power as Kings enjoy'd in other places to one or more Magistrats, either limited
<PB N="116" REF="124"/>
 to a certain time, or left to be perpetual, as best pleas'd themselves: Others approving the Name, made the Dignity purely elective. Some have in their Elections principally regarded one Family as long as it last∣ed: Others consider'd nothing but the fitness of the Person, and re∣serv'd to themselves a Liberty of taking where they pleas'd. Some have permitted the Crown to be hereditary as to its ordinary course; but restrain'd the Power, and instituted Officers to inspect the Proceedings of Kings, and to take care that the Laws were not violated: Of this sort were the <HI>Ephori</HI> of <HI>Sparta,</HI> the <HI>Maires du Palais,</HI> and afterwards the Con∣stable of <HI>France;</HI> the <HI>Justicia</HI> in <HI>Arragon;</HI> the <HI>Rijcshofmeister</HI> in <HI>Denmark;</HI> the High Steward in <HI>England;</HI> and in all places such Assemblys as are be∣fore mention'd under several names, who had the Power of the whole Na∣tion. Some have continu'd long, and it may be always in the same form; others have chang'd it: Some being incens'd against their Kings, as the <HI>Romans</HI> exasperated by the Villanys of <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and the <HI>Tuscans</HI> by the Crueltys of <HI>Mezentius,</HI> abolish'd the name of King: Others, as <HI>Athens, Sici∣on, Argos, Corinth, Thebes,</HI> and the <HI>Latins,</HI> did not stay for such extremitys; but set up other Governments when they thought it best for themselves, and by this conduct prevented the evils that usually fall upon Nations, when their Kings degenerate into Tyrants, and a Nation is brought to en∣ter into a War by which all may be lost, and nothing can be gain'd which was not their own before. The <HI>Romans</HI> took not this salutary Course; the mischief was grown up before they perceiv'd, or set themselves against it; and when the effects of Pride, Avarice, Cruelty and Lust were grown to such a height, that they could no longer be endur'd, they could not free themselves without a War: and whereas upon other occa∣sions their Victorys had brought them increase of Strength, Territory, and Glory; the only reward of their Vertue in this was, to be deliver'd from a Plague they had unadvisedly suffer'd to grow up among them. I confess this was most of all to be esteem'd; for if they had bin over∣thrown, their condition under <HI>Tarquin</HI> would have bin more intolerable than if they had fallen under the power of <HI>Pirrhus</HI> or <HI>Hannibal;</HI> and all their following Prosperity was the fruit of their recover'd Liberty: But it had bin much better to have reform'd the State after the death of one of their good Kings, than to be brought to fight for their Lives against that abo∣minable Tyrant. Our Author in pursuance of his aversion to all that is good, disapproves this; and wanting reasons to justify his dislike, accor∣ding to the custom of Impostors and Cheats, has recourse to the ugly terms of a <HI>Back-door, Sedition,</HI> and <HI>Faction:</HI> as if it were not as just for a People to lay aside their Kings when they receive nothing but evil, and can rationally hope for no benefit by them, as for others to set them up in expectation of good from them. But if the truth be examin'd, nothing will be found more orderly than the changes of Government, or of the Persons and Races of those that govern'd, which have bin made by many Nations. When <HI>Pharamond</HI>'s Grandson seem'd not to deserve the Crown he had worn, the <HI>French</HI> gave it to <HI>Meroveus,</HI> who more resembled him in Vertue: In process of time when this Race also degenerated, they were rejected, and <HI>Pepin</HI> advanc'd to the Throne; and the most remote in blood of his Descendents having often bin prefer'd before the nearest, and Bastards before the legitimate Issue, they were at last all laid aside; and the Crown remains to this day in the Family of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> upon whom it was bestow'd on the rejection of <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> In like manner the <HI>Castilians</HI> took <HI>Don Sancho</HI> sirnam'd the Brave, second Son to <HI>Alphonso</HI> the
<PB N="117" REF="125"/>
Wise, before <HI>Alphonso el Desheredado,</HI> Son of the elder Brother <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> The States of <HI>Arragon</HI> prefer'd <HI>Martin,</HI> Brother to <HI>John</HI> the first, before <HI>Mary</HI> his Daughter marry'd to the Count <HI>de Foix,</HI> tho Females were not excluded from the Succession; and the House of <HI>Austria</HI> now enjoys that Crown from <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter to <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> In that and many other King∣doms, Bastards have bin advanc'd before their legitimate Brothers. <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> Count of <HI>Trastamara,</HI> Bastard to <HI>Alphonso</HI> XI. King of <HI>Castile,</HI> receiv'd the Crown as a reward of the good Service he had done to his Country against his Brother <HI>Peter</HI> the Cruel, without any regard had to the House of <HI>La Cerda</HI> descended from <HI>Alphonso el Desheredado,</HI> which to this day never enjoy'd any greater honour than that of Duke <HI>de Medina Celi.</HI> Not long after the <HI>Portuguese</HI> conceiving a dislike of their King <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and his Daughter marry'd to <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI> rejected her and her Uncle by the Father's side, and gave the Crown to <HI>John</HI> a Knight of <HI>Cala∣trava,</HI> and Bastard to an Uncle of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> their King. About the begin∣ning of this age the <HI>Swedes</HI> depos'd their King <HI>Sigismund</HI> for being a Papist, and made <HI>Charles</HI> his Uncle King. Divers Examples of the like nature in <HI>England</HI> have bin already mention'd. All these transportations of Crowns were Acts perform'd by Assemblys of the three Estates in the several King∣doms, and these Crowns are to this day enjoy'd under Titles deriv'd from such as were thus brought in by the deposition or rejection of those, who according to descent of blood had better Titles than the present Pos∣sessors. The Acts therefore were lawful and good, or they can have no Title at all; and they who made 'em, had a just power so to do.</P>
<P>If our Author can draw any advantage from the resemblance of Re∣gality that he finds in the <HI>Roman</HI> Consuls and <HI>Athenian</HI> Archons, I shall without envy leave him the enjoyment of it; but I am much mistaken if that dos not prove my assertion, that those Governments <HI>were compos'd of the three simple species:</HI> for if the Monarchical part was in them, it cannot be deny'd that the Aristocratical was in the Senat or <HI>Areopagi,</HI> and the Democratical in the People. But he ought to have remember'd, that if there was something of Monarchical in those Governments when they are said to have bin Popular, there was something of Aristocratical and De∣mocratical in those that were call'd Regal; which justifys my proposition on both sides, and shews that the denomination was taken from the part that prevail'd: and if this were not so, the Governments of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> might be call'd Democracys, and those of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> Monarchys, because the People have a part in the one, and an image of Monarchy was preserv'd in the other.</P>
<P>If our Author will not allow the cases to be altogether equal, I think he will find no other difference, than that the Consuls and Archons were regularly made by the Votes of the consenting People, and orderly re∣sign'd their Power, when the time was expir'd for which it was given; whereas <HI>Tarquin, Dionysius, Agathocles, Nabis, Phalaris, Cesar,</HI> and al∣most all his Successors, whom he takes for compleat Monarchs, came in by violence, fraud, and corruption, by the help of the worst men, by the slaughter of the best, and most commonly (when the method was once establish'd) by that of his Predecessor, who, if our Author says true, was the Father of his Country, and his also. This was the root and foundation of the only Government that deserves praise: this is that which stampt the divine character upon <HI>Agathocles, Dionysius</HI> and <HI>Cesar,</HI> and that had bestow'd the same upon <HI>Manlius, Marius,</HI> or <HI>Catiline,</HI> if they had gain'd the Monarchys they affected. But I suppose that such as
<PB N="118" REF="126"/>
 God has blest with better judgment, and a due regard to Justice and Truth, will say, that all those who have attain'd to such greatness as de∣stroys all manner of good in the places where they have set up themselves by the most detestable Villanys, came in by a <HI>backdoor;</HI> and that such Magistrats as were orderly chosen by a willing People, were the true Shep∣herds who came in by the gate of the Sheepfold, and might justly be call'd the Ministers of God, so long as they perform'd their duty in pro∣viding for the good of the Nations committed to their charge.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVII. Good Governments admit of Changes in the Superstructures, whilst the Foundations remain unchangeable.</HEAD>
<P>IF I go a step farther, and confess the <HI>Romans</HI> made some changes in the outward Form of their Government, I may safely say they did well in it, and prosper'd by it. After the Expulsion of the Kings, the Power was chiefly in the Nobility, who had bin Leaders of the People; but it was necessary to humble them, when they began to presume too much upon the advantages of their Birth; and the City could never have bin great, unless the Plebeians who were the Body of it, and the main strength of their Armys, had bin admitted to a participation of Ho∣nours. This could not be done at the first: They who had bin so vilely opprest by <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and harass'd with making or cleansing Sinks, were not then fit for Magistracys, or the Command of Armys: but they could not justly be excluded from them, when they had men who in courage and conduct were equal to the best of the Patricians; and it had bin ab∣surd for any man to think it a disparagement to him to marry the Daugh∣ter of one whom he had obey'd as Dictator or Consul, and perhaps fol∣low'd in his Triumph. <HI>Rome</HI> that was constituted for War, and sought its Grandeur by that means, could never have arriv'd to any considerable height, if the People had not bin exercis'd in Arms, and their Spirits rais'd to delight in Conquests, and willing to expose themselves to the greatest fatigues and dangers to accomplish them. Such men as these were not to be us'd like Slaves, or opprest by the unmerciful hand of Usu∣rers. They who by their sweat and blood were to defend and enlarge the Territorys of the State, were to be convinc'd they fought for them∣selves; and they had reason to demand a Magistracy of their own, vested with a Power that none might offend, to maintain their Rights, and to protect their Familys whilst they were abroad in the Armys. These were the Tribuns of the People, made, as they call'd it, <HI>Sacrosancti</HI> or inviolable; and the creation of them was the most considerable Change that happen'd till the time of <HI>Marius,</HI> who brought all into disorder. The creation or abolition of Military Tribuns with Consular Power, ought to be accounted as nothing; for it imported little whether that Au∣thority were exercis'd by two, or by five: That of the <HI>Decemviri</HI> was as little to be regarded: they were intended only for a Year; and tho new ones were created for another, on pretence the Laws they were to frame could not be brought to perfection in so short a time, yet they were soon thrown down from the Power they usurp'd, and endeavour'd to retain contrary to Law: The creation of Dictators was no novelty, they
<PB N="119" REF="127"/>
were made occasionally from the beginning, and never otherwise than occasionally, till <HI>Julius Cesar</HI> subverted all order, and invading that su∣preme Magistracy by force <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jura omnium in se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>, usurp'd the Right which belong'd to all. This indeed was a mortal Change even in root and principle. All other Magistrats had bin created by the People for the publick good, and al∣ways were within the power of those that had created them. But <HI>Cesar</HI> coming in by force, sought only the satisfaction of his own raging Ambi∣tion, or that of the Soldiers, whom he had corrupted to destroy their Country; and his Successors governing for themselves by the help of the like Villains, perpetually expos'd the Empire to be ravag'd by them. But whatever opinion any man may have of the other Changes, I dare affirm, there are few or no Monarchys (whose Historys are so well known to us as that of <HI>Rome)</HI> which have not suffer'd Changes incompa∣rably greater and more mischievous than those of <HI>Rome</HI> whilst it was free. The <HI>Macedonian</HI> Monarchy fell into pieces immediately after the death of <HI>Alexander:</HI> 'Tis thought he perish'd by Poison: His Wives, Children and Mother, were destroy'd by his own Captains: The best of those who had escap'd his fury, fell by the Sword of each other. When the famous <HI>Argyraspides</HI> might have expected some Reward of their labours, and a little rest in old age, they were maliciously sent into the East by <HI>An∣tigonus,</HI> to perish by hunger and misery, after he had corrupted them to betray <HI>Eumenes.</HI> No better fate attended the rest; all was in confusion, every one follow'd whom he pleas'd, and all of them seem'd to be fill'd with such a rage, that they never ceas'd from mutual slaughters till they were consum'd; and their Kingdoms continu'd in perpetual Wars against each other, till they all fell under the <HI>Roman</HI> Power. The fortune of <HI>Rome</HI> was the same after it became a Monarchy: Treachery, Murder and Fury, reign'd in every part; there was no Law but Force; he that could corrupt an Army, thought he had a sufficient Title to the Empire: by this means there were frequently three or four, and at one time thirty se∣veral Pretenders, who call'd themselves Emperors; of which number he only reign'd that had the happiness to destroy all his Competitors; and he himself continu'd no longer than till another durst attempt the destruction of him and his Posterity. In this state they remain'd, till the wasted and bloodless Provinces were possest by a multitude of barbarous Nations. The Kingdoms establish'd by them enjoy'd as little Peace or Justice; that of <HI>France</HI> was frequently divided into as many parts as the Kings of <HI>Mero∣veus</HI> or <HI>Pepin</HI>'s Race had Children, under the names of the Kingdoms of <HI>Paris, Orleans, Soissons, Arles, Burgundy, Austrasia,</HI> and others: These were perpetually vex'd by the unnatural fury of Brothers or nearest Rela∣tions, whilst the miserable Nobility and People were oblig'd to fight up∣on their foolish Quarrels, till all fell under the power of the strongest. This mischief was in some measure cur'd by a Law made in the time of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> that the Kingdom should no more be divided: But the <HI>Ap∣panages,</HI> as they call them, granted to the King's Brothers, with the se∣veral Dukedoms and Earldoms erected to please them and other great Lords, produc'd frequently almost as bad effects. This is testify'd by the desperate and mortal Factions, that went under the names of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Orleans, Armagnac</HI> and <HI>Orleans, Montmorency</HI> and <HI>Guise:</HI> These were fol∣low'd by those of the League, and the Wars of the <HI>Hugonots:</HI> They
<PB N="120" REF="128"/>
 were no sooner finish'd by the taking of <HI>Rochel,</HI> but new ones began by the Intrigues of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> Brother to <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th,</HI> and his Mother; and pursu'd with that animosity by them, that they put them∣selves under the protection of <HI>Spain:</HI> To which may be added, that the Houses of <HI>Conde, Soissons, Montmorency, Guise, Vendosme, Angouleme, Bouillon, Rohan, Longueville, Rochefocault, Epernon,</HI> and I think I may say every one that is of great eminency in that Kingdom, with the Citys of <HI>Paris, Bourdeaux,</HI> and many others, in the space of these last fifty years, have sided with the perpetual Enemys of their own Country.</P>
<P>Again, other great Alterations have happen'd within the same King∣dom: The Races of Kings four times wholly chang'd: Five Kings de∣pos'd in less than 150 Years after the death of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great: The Offices of <HI>Maire du Palais,</HI> and Constable, erected and laid aside: The great Dukedoms and Earldoms, little inferior to Sovereign Principalitys, establish'd and supprest: The decision of all Causes, and the execution of the Laws, plac'd absolutely in the hands of the Nobility, their Deputys, Seneschals, or Vice-Seneschals, and taken from them again: Parliaments set up to receive Appeals from the other Courts, and to judg sovereignly in all cases, expresly to curb them: The Power of these Parliaments, af∣ter they had crush'd the Nobility, brought so low, that within the last twenty years they are made to register, and give the Power of Laws, to Edicts, of which the Titles only are read to them; and the General As∣semblys of Estates, that from the time of <HI>Pepin</HI> had the Power of the Nation in their hands, are now brought to nothing, and almost forgotten.</P>
<P>Tho I mention these things, 'tis not with a design of blaming them, for some of them deserve it not; and it ought to be consider'd, that the Wisdom of man is imperfect, and unable to foresee the Effects that may proceed from an infinite variety of Accidents, which according to Emer∣gences, necessarily require new Constitutions, to prevent or cure the mis∣chiefs arising from them, or to advance a good that at the first was not thought on: And as the noblest work in which the Wit of man can be exercis'd, were (if it could be done) to constitute a Government that should last for ever, the next to that is to sute Laws to present Exigences, and so much as is in the power of man to foresee: And he that should resolve to persist obstinately in the way he first enter'd upon, or to blame those who go out of that in which their Fathers had walk'd, when they find it necessary, dos as far as in him lies, render the worst of Errors perpetual. Changes therefore are unavoidable, and the Wit of man can go no farther than to institute such, as in relation to the Forces, Manners, Nature, Religion or Interests of a People and their Neighbours, are sutable and adequate to what is seen, or apprehended to be seen: And he who would oblige all Nations at all times to take the same course, would prove as foolish as a Physician who should apply the same Medicin to all Distempers, or an Architect that would build the same kind of House for all Persons, without considering their Estates, Dignitys, the number of their Children or Servants, the Time or Climate in which they live, and many other Circumstances; or, which is, if possible, more sottish, a General who should obstinately resolve always to make War in the same way, and to draw up his Army in the same form, without examining the nature, number and strength of his own and his Enemys Forces, or the advantages and disadvantages of the Ground. But as there may be some universal Rules in Physick, Architecture and Military Disciplin, from which men ought never to depart; so there are some in Politicks also,
<PB N="121" REF="129"/>
which ought always to be observ'd: and wise Legislators adhering to them only, will be ready to change all others as occasion may require, in order to the publick Good. This we may learn from <HI>Moses,</HI> who laying the Foundation of the Law given to the <HI>Israelites</HI> in that Justice, Charity and Truth, which having its root in God, is subject to no change, left them the liberty of having Judges or no Judges, Kings or no Kings, or to give the Sovereign Power to High Priests or Captains, as best pleas'd themselves; and the Mischiefs they afterwards suffer'd, proceeded not simply from chang∣ing, but changing for the worse. The like judgment may be made of the Alterations that have happen'd in other places. They who aim at the publick Good, and wisely institute means proportionable and adequate to the attainment of it, deserve praise; and those only are to be dislik'd, who either foolishly or maliciously set up a corrupt private Interest in one or a few men. Whosoever therefore would judg of the <HI>Roman</HI> Changes, may see, that expelling the <HI>Tarquins,</HI> creating Consuls, abating the vio∣lence of Usurers, admitting <HI>Plebeians</HI> to marry with the <HI>Patricians,</HI> ren∣dring them capable of Magistracys, deducing Colonys, dividing Lands gain'd from their Enemys, erecting Tribuns to defend the Rights of the Commons, appointing the <HI>Decemviri</HI> to regulate the Law, and abrogating their Power when they abus'd it, creating Dictators and Military Tri∣buns with a Consular Power, as occasions requir'd; they acted in the face of the Sun for the good of the Publick; and such Acts having always produc'd Effects sutable to the rectitude of their Intentions, they conse∣quently deserve praise. But when another Principle began to govern, all things were chang'd in a very different manner: Evil Designs, tending only to the advancement of private Interests, were carry'd on in the dark by means as wicked as the end. If <HI>Tarquin</HI> when he had a mind to be King, poison'd his first Wife and his Brother, contracted an incestuous Mar∣riage with his second by the death of her first Husband, murder'd her Fa∣ther and the best men in <HI>Rome,</HI> yet <HI>Cesar</HI> did worse: He favour'd <HI>Catiline</HI> and his villanous Associats, brib'd and corrupted Magistrats; conspir'd with <HI>Crassus</HI> and <HI>Pompey;</HI> continu'd in the Command of an Army beyond the time prescrib'd by Law, and turn'd the Arms with which he had bin intrusted for the service of the Commonwealth, to the destruction of it; which was rightly represented by his Dream, that he had constuprated his Mother: In the like manner when <HI>Octavius, Antonius</HI> and <HI>Lepidus,</HI> divided the Empire, and then quarrel'd among themselves; and when <HI>Galba, Otho, Vitellius</HI> and <HI>Vespasian</HI> set up Partys in several Provinces, all was manag'd with Treachery, Fraud and Cruelty; nothing was intended but the advancement of one Man, and the Recompence of the Villains that serv'd him: And when the Empire had suffer'd infinite Calamitys by pulling down or rejecting one, and setting up another, it was for the most part difficult to determin who was the worst of the two; or whe∣ther the prevailing side had gain'd or lost by their Victory. The question therefore upon which a Judgment may be made to the praise or dispraise of the <HI>Roman</HI> Government, before or after the loss of their Liberty, ought not to be, Whether either were subject to changes, for neither they nor any thing under the Sun was ever exempted from them; but whether the Changes that happen'd after the establishment of Absolute Power in the Emperors, did not solely proceed from Ambition, and tend to the publick Ruin: whereas those Alterations related by our Author concern∣ing Consuls, Dictators, <HI>Decemviri,</HI> Tribunes and Laws, were far more rare, less violent, tending to, and procuring the publick Good, and there∣fore
<PB N="122" REF="130"/>
 deserving praise. The like having bin prov'd by the Examples of other Kingdoms, and might be farther confirm'd by many more, which on account of brevity I omit, is in my opinion sufficient to manifest, that whilst the Foundation and Principle of a Government remains good, the Superstructures may be chang'd according to occasions, without any pre∣judice to it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVIII. <HI>Xenophon</HI> in blaming the Disorders of Democracys, favours Aristocracys, not Monarchys.</HEAD>
<P>IN the next place our Author introduces <HI>Xenophon disallowing Popular Governments:</HI> Cites <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> as Places <HI>where the best Men thriv'd worst, and the worst best;</HI> and condemns the <HI>Romans</HI> for making it capital to pass Sentence <HI>of Death, Banishment, loss of Liberty, or Stripes upon any Citizen of</HI> Rome. But lest his Fraud in this should be detected, he cites no precise Passage of any Author, alledges few Examples, and those mistaken; never tells us what that Law was, when made, or where to be found: whereas I hope to prove, that he has upon the whole mat∣ter abominably prevaricated, and advanc'd things that he knows to be either impertinent or false.</P>
<P>1. To this end we are in the first place to consider, whether <HI>Xenophon</HI> speaks of Popular Governments simply, or comparatively: if simply, 'tis confest that a pure Democracy can never be good, unless for a small Town; if comparatively, we must examin to what he compares it: We are sure it was not to Absolute Monarchy; there was no such thing a∣mongst the <HI>Greeks</HI> establish'd by Law: The little Tyrants who had en∣slav'd their own Countrys, as <HI>Jason, Phaereus, Phalaris,</HI> and the like, had no pretence to it, and were accounted as the worst of Beasts: None but such as in all bestiality were like to 'em, did ever speak or think well of them. <HI>Xenophon</HI>'s Opinion in this point, may be easily found out by what pass'd between his Master <HI>Plato</HI> and the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Tyrant; and the matter will not be mended by referring to his own experience: He had seen the vast Monarchy of <HI>Persia</HI> torn in pieces by the fury of two Bro∣thers, and more than a million of men brought to fight upon their private quarrel: Instead of that Order, Stability and Strength which our Author ascribes to Absolute Monarchy as the effect of Wisdom and Justice, he knew, that by filling one man with pride and cruelty, it brought unspeak∣able miserys upon all others, and infected 'em with all the Vices that ac∣company Slavery: Men liv'd like Fishes, the great ones devour'd the small; and as appear'd by <HI>Tissaphernes, Pharnabazus,</HI> and others with whom he had to deal, the worst and basest were made to be the greatest: The <HI>Satrapes</HI> insulted over those of meaner rank, with an insolence and cruelty that equal'd the depth of their servil submission to their proud Master. Luxury and Avarice reign'd in all: many great Nations were made to live for the service of one man, and to foment his Vices. This produc'd weakness and cowardice; no number of those Slaves were able to stand against a few free <HI>Grecians.</HI> No man knew this better than <HI>Xe∣nophon,</HI> who after the death of <HI>Cyrus</HI> the younger, and the treacherous murder of <HI>Clearchus,</HI> and other Officers that commanded the <HI>Greeks</HI> who
<PB N="123" REF="131"/>
had serv'd him, made his retreat from <HI>Babylon</HI> to the <HI>Hellespont</HI> with ten thousand foot, and passed over the bellys of all that dar'd to oppose him. He would never have spent his life in exciting his Countrymen to at∣tempt the Conquest of <HI>Asia,</HI> nor persuaded <HI>Agesilaus</HI> to put himself at the head of the Enterprize, if he had thought there was such admirable Order, Stability and Strength in that Monarchy, and in the <HI>Greeks</HI> no∣thing but <HI>giddiness of Spirit, and so much Learning as made them seditious:</HI> Nor could he, being a wise man and an excellent Captain, have conceiv'd such a design, if he had not by experience found that Liberty inspir'd his Countrymen with such solid Vertue, and produc'd such Stability, good Order and Strength, that with small numbers of them he might hope to overthrow the vain Pomp of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and to possess himself of their Riches, tho they could bring more than a hundred men to fight against one; which Design being interrupted in his time by domestick Wars, was soon after his death accomplish'd by <HI>Alexander.</HI></P>
<P>But that <HI>Xenophon</HI>'s meaning may be better understood, 'tis good to consider, that he spoke of such Governments as were then in use among the <HI>Greeks;</HI> which tho mix'd, yet took their denomination from the pre∣vailing part: so that the <HI>Dorians,</HI> who plac'd the Power chiefly in the hands of a few chosen men, were said to be govern'd Aristocratically; and the <HI>Ionians</HI> giving more Power to the common People, Democrati∣cally: And he, tho an <HI>Ionian,</HI> either thro friendship to <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> con∣versation with the <HI>Spartans,</HI> or for other reasons best known to himself, prefer'd the Government of <HI>Sparta,</HI> or some other which he thought he could frame, and desir'd to introduce, before that of <HI>Athens;</HI> as <HI>Cimon, Thucydides,</HI> and many other excellent men of that City are said to have done: And if I acknowledg they were in the right, and that <HI>Athens</HI> was more subject to disorder, and had less Stability than <HI>Sparta,</HI> I think it will be of little advantage to Absolute Monarchy.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Athenians</HI> did banish some worthy men, and put others to death; but our Author, like the Devil, never speaking truth, unless to turn it into a lie, prevaricates in his report of them. The temporary ba∣nishment, which they call'd <HI>Ostracism,</HI> was without hurt or dishonour, never accounted as a Punishment, nor intended for any other end, than to put a stop to the too eminent greatness of a man, that might prove dange∣rous to the City; and some excellent Persons who fell under it, were soon recall'd, and brought home with glory. But I am not solicitous whether that reason be sufficient to justify it or not: We are upon a general <HI>Thesis</HI> relating to the Laws of God and Nature; and if the <HI>Athenians,</HI> by a fancy of their own, did make an imprudent use of their Liberty, it can∣not prejudice the publick Cause. They who make the worst of it can only say, that by such means they, for a time, depriv'd themselves of the benefits they might have receiv'd from the Vertues of some excellent men, to the hurt of none but themselves; and the application of it as an in∣justice done to <HI>Themistocles,</HI> is absolutely false: He was a man of great Wit, Industry and Valour, but of uncertain Faith, too much addicted to his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vit. Themist.</NOTE>own Interest, and held a most dangerous Correspondence with the <HI>Per∣sians,</HI> who then threaten'd the destruction of <HI>Greece.</HI> Thro envy and spite to <HI>Aristides,</HI> and to increase his own Power, he rais'd dangerous Factions in the City, and being summon'd to render an account of his Pro∣ceedings, he declin'd the Judgment of his Country, fled to their Enemys, and justly deserv'd the Sentence pronounc'd against him. Some among them were unjustly put to death, and above all <HI>Socrates;</HI> but the People,
<PB N="124" REF="132"/>
 who, deceiv'd by false Witnesses, (against whom neither the Laws of God or Man have ever prescrib'd a sufficient defence) had condemn'd him, did so much lament their Crime, when the truth was discover'd to them, that I doubt whether a more righteous Judgment had given bet∣ter testimony of their righteous Intentions. But our Author's impudence appears in the highest excess, in imputing the death of <HI>Phocion</HI> to the po∣pular State of <HI>Athens:</HI> Their Forces had bin broken in the <HI>Sicilian</HI> War; the City taken, and the principal Men slain by <HI>Lysander;</HI> the remains of the most Worthy destroy'd by the thirty Tyrants set up by him; their ill-recover'd Liberty overthrown by the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> and the death of <HI>Phocion</HI> compast by <HI>Polyperchon,</HI> who with Foreign Soldiers, Slaves, Va∣gabonds, and Outlaws, overpower'd the People.</P>
<P>The proceedings of <HI>Rome</HI> may be more compleatly justify'd: <HI>Coriola∣nus</HI> was duly condemn'd, he set too great a price upon his own Valour, and arrogated to himself a Power in <HI>Rome,</HI> which would hardly have bin indur'd in <HI>Corioli:</HI> His violence and pride overbalanc'd his Services; and he that would submit to no Law, was justly driven out from the So∣ciety which could subsist only by Law. <HI>Quintius</HI> was not unlike him, and <HI>Manlius Capitolinus</HI> far worse than either. Their Vertues were not to be consider'd when they departed from them. Consideration ought to be had of human frailty, and some indulgence may be extended to those who commit Errors, after having done important Services; but a State cannot subsist, which compensating evil Actions with good, gives impu∣nity to the most dangerous Crimes, in remembrance of any Services whatever. He that dos well, performs his Duty, and ought always to do so: Justice and Prudence concur in this; and 'tis no less just than pro∣fitable, that every Action be consider'd by it self, and such a reward or punishment allotted to it, as in nature and proportion it best de∣serves.</P>
<P>This, as I suppose, is enough for their Cases; but relates not to those of <HI>Mamercus, Camillus, Livius Salinator,</HI> and <HI>Emylius Paulus;</HI> their Ver∣tue was compleat, they were wrongfully sentenc'd. But the best Princes, Senat or People that ever was in the world, by the deceit of evil men, may and have bin drawn out of the way of Justice: Yet of all the States that are known to us, none was ever so free from Crimes of malice and wilful injustice; none was ever guilty of so few Errors as that of <HI>Rome;</HI> and none did ever give better testimonys of Repentance, when they were discover'd, than the <HI>Romans</HI> did by the Veneration they shew'd to those worthy Persons, and the Honors they confer'd upon them afterwards. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Liv.</NOTE><HI>Mamercus</HI> was made Dictator, to repair the unjust mark of Infamy laid upon him by the Censors. <HI>Camillus</HI> being recall'd from his banishment, often enjoy'd the same honour, and died the most reverenc'd Man that had ever bin in that City. <HI>Livius Salinator</HI> was not only made Consul after he had bin fin'd, but the People (as it were to expiate the guilt of having condemn'd him) suffer'd that asperity of speech and manners, which might have persuaded such as had bin less confident of his Vertue and their own, that he desir'd to be reveng'd, tho it were with the ruin of the City. They dealt in the like manner with <HI>Paulus Emylius,</HI> repairing the injury of a Fine unduly impos'd. Their generosity in leaving the Tri∣buns in the <HI>Forum,</HI> with their Accusation against <HI>Scipio Africanus,</HI> and following him to celebrate an annual Sacrifice in the Capitol, in comme∣moration of his victory against <HI>Hannibal,</HI> was no less admirable than the greatness of his mind, who thought his Vertue should be so well known,
<PB N="125" REF="133"/>
that no account ought to be expected from him; which was an Error proceeding from a noble Root, but not to be born in a well-govern'd Commonwealth. The Laws that aim at the publick Good, make no di∣stinction of Persons; and none can be exempted from the Penaltys of them, otherwise than by approv'd Innocence, which cannot appear with∣out a Trial: He that will not bend his mind to them, shakes off the e∣quality of a Citizen, and usurps a Power above the Law, to which no man submits upon any other condition, than that none should be exemp∣ted from the power of it. And <HI>Scipio</HI> being the first <HI>Roman</HI> that thus disdain'd the Power of the Law, I do not know whether the prejudice brought upon the City by so dangerous an Example, did not outweigh all the Services he had done: Nevertheless the people contented with his re∣tirement to his own house, and afterwards convinc'd of his Innocence, would probably (if he had not dy'd in a few months) have brought him back with the Honours that Fate reserv'd for his ashes.</P>
<P>I do not at present remember any other eminent men, who can be said in any respect to have <HI>thriv'd ill,</HI> whilst the People and Senat of <HI>Rome</HI> acted freely; and if this be not sufficient to clear the point, I desire to know the names of those <HI>worst men that thriv'd best.</HI> If they may have bin judg'd to thrive, who were frequently advanc'd to the supreme Ma∣gistracys, and enjoy'd the chief Honors; I find no men so eminent as <HI>Brutus, Publicola, Quintius Cincinnatus,</HI> and <HI>Capitolinus,</HI> the two <HI>Fabii</HI> sirnam'd <HI>Maximi, Corvinus, Torquatus, Camillus,</HI> and the like: and if these were the worst Men that <HI>Rome</HI> produc'd in those Ages, Valor, Wisdom, Industry in the Service of their Country, and a most intire Love to it, must have bin the worst of qualitys; and I presume our Author may have thought them so, since they were invincible obstacles to the in∣troduction of that Divine Monarchy which <HI>Appius Claudius</HI> the Decem∣vir, <HI>Manlius Capitolinus, Spurius Cassius, Sp. Melius,</HI> and some others may be thought to have affected.</P>
<P>However, these instances are not to be understood as they are simply in themselves, but comparatively with what has happen'd in other places under absolute Monarchys: for our inquiry is not after that which is per∣fect, well knowing that no such thing is found among men; but we seek that human Constitution which is attended with the least, or the most pardonable inconveniences. And if we find that in the space of three hundred years, while the Senat, People, and legally created Magistrats govern'd <HI>Rome,</HI> not one worthy Man was put to death, not above five or six condemn'd to Fines by the beguil'd People, and those injurys re∣pair'd by the most honourable satisfaction that could be given; so that Vertue continu'd ever flourishing; the best men that could be found were put into the chief Commands, and the City was fill'd with more excel∣lent men than were ever known to be in any other place: And on the other side, if the Emperors so soon as the Government was chang'd, made it their business to destroy the best, and so far succeeded in their design, that they left none; and never fail'd to advance the worst, unless it fell out as to Queen <HI>Katherine de Medicis,</HI> who is said never to have done any good but by mistake, and some few may have prov'd better than was in∣tended; it will appear, that our Author's Assertions are in the utmost de∣gree false. Of this we need no better witness than <HI>Tacitus.</HI> The Civil Wars, and the Proscriptions upon which he touches, are justly to be at∣tributed to that Monarchy which was then setting up, the only question being who should be the Monarch, when the Liberty was already over∣thrown.
<PB N="126" REF="134"/>
 And if any eminent Men escap'd, it was much against the will of those who had usurp'd the Power: He acknowledges his Historys to be a continu'd relation of the slaughter of the most illustrious Persons, and that in the times of which he writes, Vertue was attended with certain destruction. After the death of <HI>Germanicus</HI> and his eldest Children, <HI>Vale∣rius Asiaticus, Seneca, Corbulo,</HI> and an infinite number more who were thought most to resemble them, found this to be true at the expence of their lives: <HI>Nero,</HI> in pursuance of the same tyrannical design, murder'd <HI>Helvidius</HI> and <HI>Thraseas,</HI> that he might <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ipsam exscindere virtutem. <BIBL>Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>tear up Vertue by the roots: Domi∣tian</HI> spar'd none willingly that had either Vertue or Reputation; and tho <HI>Trajan,</HI> with perhaps some other, might grow up under him in the re∣mote Provinces, yet no good Man could escape who came under his eye, and was so eminent as to be observ'd by him. Whilst these, who were thought to be the best Men that appear'd in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, did <HI>thrive</HI> in this manner, <HI>Sejanus, Macro, Narcissus, Pallas, Tigellinus, Icetus, Vin∣nius, Laco,</HI> and others like to 'em, had the power of the Empire in their hands. Therefore, unless Mankind has bin mistaken to this day, and that these, who have hitherto bin accounted the worst of Villains, were indeed the best Men in the world; and that those destroy'd by them, who are thought to have bin the best, were truly the worst, it cannot be deny'd that the best Men, during the Liberty of <HI>Rome, thriv'd</HI> best; that good Men suffer'd no indignity, unless by some fraud impos'd upon the well-meaning People; and that so soon as the Liberty was subverted, the worst men <HI>thriv'd</HI> best. The best Men were expos'd to so many Calami∣tys and Snares, that it was thought a matter of great wonder to see a vertuous man die in his bed: and if the account were well made, I think it might appear, that every one of the Emperors before <HI>Titus</HI> shed more noble and innocent Blood, than <HI>Rome</HI> and all the Commonwealths in the world have done, whilst they had the free enjoyment of their own Liber∣ty. But if any man in favour of our Author seeks to diminish the vast disproportion between the two differing sorts of Government, and imputes the disorders that happen'd in the time of the <HI>Gracchi,</HI> and others, whilst <HI>Rome</HI> was strugling for her Liberty, to the Government of a Common∣wealth, he will find them no more to be compar'd with those that fell out afterwards, than the railings of a turbulent Tribune against the Senat, to the Villanys and Crueltys that corrupted and dispeopl'd the Provinces from <HI>Babylon</HI> to <HI>Scotland.</HI> And whereas the State never fail'd to recover from any disorders, as long as the Root of Liberty remain'd untouch'd, and became more powerful and glorious than ever, even after the Wars of <HI>Marius</HI> and <HI>Sylla;</HI> when that was destroy'd, the City fell into a lan∣guishing condition, and grew weaker and weaker, till that and the whole Empire was ruin'd by the Barbarians.</P>
<P>3. Our Author, to shew that his memory is as good as his judgment, having represented <HI>Rome</HI> in the times of Liberty as a publick Slaughter∣house, soon after blames the clemency of their Laws: whereas 'tis impossible that the same City could at the same time be guilty of those contrary ex∣tremitys; and no less certain, that it was perfectly free from them both. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sallust. Bell. Catilin.</NOTE>His assertion seems to be grounded upon <HI>Cesar</HI>'s Speech (related by <HI>Sallust)</HI> in favour of <HI>Lentulus</HI> and <HI>Cethegus</HI> Companions of <HI>Catiline:</HI> but tho he there endeavour'd to put the best colour he could upon their cause, it sig∣nify'd only thus much, that a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen could not be put to death,
<PB N="127" REF="135"/>
without being heard in publick; which Law will displease none that in understanding and integrity may not be compar'd to <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Fol∣lowers. 'Tis a folly to extend it farther; for 'tis easily prov'd that there was always a power of putting Citizens to death, and that it was exer∣cis'd when occasion requir'd. The Laws were the same in the time of the Kings, when that Office was executed by Consuls, excepting such changes as are already mention'd. The <HI>Lex perduellionis</HI> cited by <HI>Livy</HI> in the case of <HI>Horatius</HI> who had kill'd his Sister, continu'd in force from the foundation to the end of that Government: the condemnation was to death, the words of the Sentence these, <HI>Caput obnubito, infelici arbore reste suspendito; verberato intra Pomaerium vel extra Pomaerium.</HI> He was try'd by this Law upon an appeal made to the People by his Father, and absolv'd <HI>admiratione magis virtutis quam jure causae;</HI> which could not have bin, if by the Law no Citizen might be put to death. The Sons of <HI>Brutus</HI> were condemn'd to death in publick, and executed with the <HI>Aquilii</HI> and <HI>Vitellii</HI> their Companions in the same Conspiracy: <HI>Manlius Capitolinus</HI> was put to death by the vote of the People: <HI>Titus Manlius</HI> by the command of his Father <HI>Torquatus,</HI> for fighting without order: Two Legions were decimated by <HI>Appius Claudius: Spurius Melius</HI> refu∣sing to appear before the Dictator, was kill'd by <HI>Servilius Ahala</HI> General of the Horse, and pronounc'd <HI>jure caesum: Quintus Fabius</HI> was by <HI>Papi∣rius</HI> the Dictator condemn'd to die, and could not have bin sav'd but by the intercession and authority of the People. If this be not so, I de∣sire to be inform'd what the Senat meant by condemning <HI>Nero</HI> to be put to death <HI>more majorum,</HI> if <HI>more majorum</HI> no Citizen might be put to death: Why the Consuls, Dictators, Military Tribuns, <HI>Decemviri,</HI> caus'd Rods and Axes to be carry'd before them, as well within as with∣out the City, if no use was to be made of 'em. Were they only vain Badges of a Power never to be executed; or upon whom was the Supreme Power signify'd by them, to be exercis'd within and without the City, if the Citizens were not subject to it? 'Tis strange that a man who had ever read a Book of matters relating to the Affairs of <HI>Rome,</HI> should fancy these things; or hope to impose them upon the World, if he knew them to be foolish, false, and absurd. But of all the marks of a most supine stupi∣dity that can be given by a man, I know none equal to this of our Au∣thor, who in the same Clause wherein he says no Citizen could be put to death or banish'd, adds, that the Magistrats were upon pain of death forbidden to do it; for if a Magistrate might be put to death for banishing a Citizen, or causing him to be executed, a Citizen might be put to death; for the Magistrats were not Strangers, but Citizens. If this was not so, he must think that no Crime was capital, but the punishment of capital Crimes; or that no man was subject to the Supreme Power, but he that was created for the execution of it. Yet even this will not stop the gap; for the Law that condemn'd the Magistrate to die, could be of no effect, if there were no man to execute it; and there could be none if the Law prohibited it, or that he who did it was to die for it: And this goes on to infinity. For if a Magistrate could not put a Citizen to death, I suppose a Citizen could not put to death a Magistrate; for he also is a Citizen. So that upon the whole matter we may conclude, that Malice is blind, and that Wickedness is Madness. 'Tis hard to say more in praise of Popular Governments than will result from what he says against them: his reproaches are Praises, and his Praises reproaches. As Government is instituted for the preservation of the Governed, the <HI>Romans</HI> were sparing
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>
 of Blood, and are wisely commended by <HI>Livy</HI> for it: <HI>Nulli unquam Popu∣lo mitiores placuere poenae;</HI> which gentleness will never be blam'd, unless by those who are pleas'd with nothing so much as the fury of those Mon∣sters, who with the ruin of the best part of Mankind, usurp'd the domi∣nion of that glorious City. But if the <HI>Romans</HI> were gentle in punishing Offences, they were also diligent in preventing them: the excellence of their Disciplin led the Youth to Vertue, and the Honors they receiv'd for recompence confirm'd them in it. By this means many of 'em became Laws to themselves; and they who were not the most excellent, were yet taught so much of good, that they had a veneration for those they could not equal, which not only ferv'd to incite them to do well accord∣ing to their Talents, but kept them in such a w as to fear incurring their ill opinion by any bad action, as much as by the penalty of the Law. This integrity of manners made the Laws as it were useless; and whilst they seem'd to sleep, ignorant persons thought there were none: But their Disciplin being corrupted by Prosperity, those Vices came in which made way for the Monarchy; and Wickedness being plac'd in the Throne, there was no safety for any but such as would be of the same spirit, and the Empire was ruin'd by it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIX. That Corruption and Venality which is natural to Courts, is seldom found in Popular Governments.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's next work is, with that modesty and truth which is natural to him, to impute Corruption and Venality to Common∣wealths. He knows that Monarchys are exempted from those evils, and has discover'd this truth from the integrity observ'd in the modern Courts of <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> or the more antient of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Persia:</HI> But after many falshoods in matter of fact, and misrepresentations of that which is true, he shews that the Corruption, Venality, and Violence he blames, were neither the effects of Liberty, nor consistent with it. <HI>Cneius Manlius,</HI> who with his <HI>Asiatic</HI> Army brought in the Luxury that gave birth to those mischiefs, did probably follow the looseness of his own disposition; yet the best and wisest men of that time knew from the be∣ginning that it would ruin the City, unless a stop might be put to the course of that evil: But they who had seen Kings under their feet, and could no longer content themselves with that equality which is necessary among Citizens, fomented it as the chief means to advance their am∣bitious designs. Tho <HI>Marius</HI> was rigid in his nature, and car'd nei∣ther for Mony nor sensual Pleasures, yet he favour'd those Vices in others, and is said to be the first that made use of 'em to his advantage. <HI>Catiline</HI> was one of the leudest men in the world, and had no other way of com∣passing his designs than by rendring others as bad as himself: and <HI>Cesar</HI> set up his Tyranny by spreading that corruption farther than the others had bin able to do; and tho he, <HI>Caligula,</HI> and some others were slain, yet the best men found it as impossible to restore Liberty to the City when it was corrupted, as the worst had done to set up a Tyranny whilst the inte∣grity of their manners did continue. Men have a strange propensity to run into all manner of excesses, when plenty of means invite, and there
<PB N="129" REF="137"/>
is no power to deter; of which the succeeding Emperors took advantage, and knowing that even their subsistence depended upon it, they thought themselves oblig'd by interest as well as inclination to make Honors and Preferments the rewards of Vice: and tho it be not always true in the utmost extent that all men follow the example of the King; yet it is of great effica∣cy: Tho some are so good that they will not be perverted, and others so bad that they will not be corrected; yet a great number dos always follow the course that is favour'd and rewarded by those that govern. There were Idolaters doubtless among the <HI>Jews</HI> in the days of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Heze∣kiah;</HI> but they prosper'd better under <HI>Jeroboam</HI> and <HI>Ahab: England</HI> was not without Papists in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> but they thriv'd much better during the Reign of her furious Sister. False Witnesses and Accu∣sers had a better trade under <HI>Tiberias,</HI> who call'd them <HI>Custodes Legum,</HI> than under <HI>Trajan</HI> who abhor'd them; and Whores, Players, and Fid∣lers, with other such Vermin, abounded certainly more when encourag'd by <HI>Nero,</HI> than when despis'd by <HI>Antoninus</HI> and <HI>Marcus Aurelius.</HI> But as every one of these manifested what he was by those he favor'd or pu∣nish'd, and that a man can only be judg'd by his principles or practices, he that would know whether absolute Monarchys or mix'd Govern∣ments do most foment or punish Venality and Corruption, ought to ex∣amin the principle and practice of both, and compare them one with the other.</P>
<P>As to the Principle, the above-mention'd Vices may be profitable to ptivate men, but they can never be so to the Government, if it be popu∣lar or mix'd: No People was ever the better for that which renders them weak or base; and a duly created Magistracy, governing a Nation with their consent, can have no interest distinct from that of the Publick, or desire to diminish the strength of the People, which is their own, and by which they subsist. On the other side, the absolute Monarch who go∣verns for himself, and chiefly seeks his own preservation, looks upon the strength and bravery of his Subjects as the root of his greatest danger, and frequently desires to render them weak, base, corrupt, and unfaithful to each other, that they may neither dare to attempt the breaking of the Yoke he lays upon them, nor trust one another in any generous design for the recovery of their Liberty. So that the same corruption which pre∣serves such a Prince, if it were introduc'd by a People, would weaken, if not utterly destroy them.</P>
<P>Again, all things have their continuance from a principle in Nature su∣table to their Original: all Tyrannys have had their beginnings from cor∣ruption. The Historys of <HI>Greece, Sicily,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> shew that all those who made themselves Tyrants in several places, did it by the help of the worst, and the slaughter of the best: Men could not be made subservient to their Lusts whilst they continu'd in their integrity; so as their business was to destroy those who would not be corrupted. They must therefore endeavour to maintain or increase the corruption by which they attain their greatness: If they fail in this point, they must fall as <HI>Tarquin, Pisistratus,</HI> and others have done; but if they succeed so far that the vi∣cious part do much prevail, the Government is secure, tho the Prince may be in danger. And the same thing dos in a great measure accidentally conduce to the safety of his Person: For they who for the most part are the Authors of great Revolutions, not being so much led by a particular hatred to the Man, as by a desire to do good to the Publick, seldom set themselves to conspire against the Tyrant, unless he be altogether detesta∣ble
<PB N="130" REF="138"/>
 and intolerable, if they do not hope to overthrow the Tyranny.</P>
<P>The contrary is seen in all popular and well-mix'd Governments: they are ever establish'd by wise and good men, and can never be upheld other∣wise than by Vertue: The worst men always conspiring against them, they must fall, if the best have not power to preserve them. Whereso∣ever therefore a People is so govern'd, the Magistrats will obviate afar off the introduction of Vices, which tend as much to the ruin of their Persons and Government, as to the preservation of the Prince and his. This is evidenc'd by experience. 'Tis not easy to name a Monarch that had so many good qualitys as <HI>Julius Cesar,</HI> till they were extinguish'd by his Ambition, which was inconsistent with them: He knew that his strength lay in the corruption of the People, and that he could not accom∣plish his designs without increasing it. He did not seek good men, but such as would be for him; and thought none sufficiently addicted to his Interests, but such as stuck at the performance of no wickedness that he commanded: he was a Soldier according to <HI>Cesar</HI>'s heart who said,
<Q><L>Pectore si fratris gladium jugulo{que} parentis</L>
<L>Condere me jubeas, gravidaeve in viscera partu</L>
<L>Conjugis, invita peragam tamen omnia dextra. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></L></Q>
And lest such as were devoted to him should grow faint in Villany, he industriously inflam'd their fury:
<Q><L>—Vult omnia Caesar</L>
<L>A se saeva peti, vult praemia Martis amari. <BIBL>Ib.</BIBL></L></Q>
Having spread this Poison amongst the Soldiers, his next work was by cor∣rupting the Tribuns to turn that Power to the destruction of the People, which had bin erected for their preservation; and pouring the Treasures he had gain'd by rapine in <HI>Gaul</HI> into the Bosom of <HI>Curio,</HI> made him an instrument of mischief, who had bin a most eminent Supporter of the Laws. Tho he was thought to have affected the glory of sparing <HI>Cato,</HI> and with trouble to have found that he despis'd life when it was to be ac∣counted his gift; yet in suspecting <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius,</HI> he shew'd he could not believe that vertuous men who lov'd their Country could be his Friends. Such as carry on the like designs with less Valor, Wit, and Generosity of Spirit, will always be more bitterly bent to destroy all that are good, knowing that the deformity of their own Vices is render'd most manifest, when they are compar'd with the good qualitys of those who are most unlike them; and that they can never defend themselves against the scorn and hatred they incur by their Vices, unless such a num∣ber can be infected with the same, and made to delight in the recompences of iniquity that foment them, as may be able to keep the rest of the Peo∣ple in subjection.</P>
<P>The same thing happens even when the Usurpation is not so violent as that of <HI>Agathocles, Dionysius,</HI> or the last King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who in one day by the strength of a mercenary Soldiery overthrew all the Laws of his Country: and a lawfully created Magistrate is forc'd to follow the same ways as soon as he begins to affect a Power which the Laws do not confer upon him. I wish I could say there were few of these; but experience shews that such a proportion of Wisdom, moderation of Spirit, and Justice is requir'd in a supreme Magistrate, to render him content with a
<PB N="131" REF="139"/>
limited Power, as is seldom found. Man is of an aspiring nature, and apt to put too high a value upon himself; they who are rais'd above their Brethren, tho but a little, desire to go farther; and if they gain the name of King, they think themselves wrong'd and degraded, when they are not suffer'd to do what they <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Sanctitas, pietas, sides</L>
<L>Privata bona sunt: Qua juvat reges eant. <BIBL>Senec. Thyest.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE> please. In these things they never want Masters; and the nearer they come to a Power that is not easily restrain'd by Law, the more passionately they desire to abolish all that opposes it: and when their Hearts are fill'd with this fury, they never fail to chuse such Ministers as will be subservient to their Will: and this is so well known, that those only approach them who resolve to be so. Their in∣terests as well as their inclinations incite them to diffuse their own manners as far as they can, which is no less than to bring those who are under their power to all that wickedness of which the nature of man is capable; and no greater testimony can be given of the efficacy of these means towards the utter corruption of Nations, than the accursed effects we see of 'em in our own and the neighboring Countrys.</P>
<P>It may be said that some Princes are so full of Vertue and Goodness, as not to desire more power than the Laws allow, and are not oblig'd to chuse ill men, because they desire nothing but what the best are willing to do. This may be, and sometimes is: the Nation is happy that has such a King; but he is hard to find, and more than a human Power is requir'd to keep him in so good a way. The strength of his own affections will ever be against him: Wives, Children, and Servants will always join with those Enemys that arise in his own breast to pervert him: if he has any weak side, any Lust unsubdu'd, they will gain the victory. He has not search'd into the nature of Man, who thinks that any one can resist when he is thus on all sides assaulted: Nothing but the wonderful and im∣mediate power of God's Spirit can preserve him; and to alledg it will be nothing to the purpose, unless it can be prov'd that all Princes are blest with such an assistance, or that God has promis'd it to them and their Successors for ever, by what means soever they came to the Crowns they enjoy.</P>
<P>Nothing is farther from my intention than to speak irreverently of Kings; and I presume no wise man will think I do so, if I profess, that having observ'd as well as I can what History and daily Experience teach us concerning the Vertues and Religions that are or have bin from the be∣ginning of the World encourag'd and supported by Monarchs, the me∣thods they have follow'd since they have gone under the name of Christians, their moral as well as theological Graces, together with what the Scriptures tell us of those who in the last days will principally support the Throne of Antichrist; I cannot be confident that they are generally in an extraordina∣ry manner preserv'd by the hand of God from the Vices and Frailtys to which the rest of mankind is subject. If no man can shew that I am in this mistaken, I may conclude, that as they are more than any other men in the world expos'd to temptations and snares, they are more than any in danger of being corrupted, and made Instruments of corrupting others, if they are no otherwise defended than the rest of men.</P>
<P>This being the state of the matter on both sides, we may easily collect, that all Governments are subject to corruption and decay; but with this difference, that Absolute Monarchy is by principle led unto, or rooted
<PB N="132" REF="140"/>
 in it; whereas mix'd or popular Governments are only in a possibility of falling into it: As the first cannot subsist, unless the prevailing part of the people be corrupted; the other must certainly perish, unless preserv'd in a great measure free from Vices. And I doubt whether any better reason can be given, why there have bin and are more Monarchys than popular Governments in the world, than that Nations are more easily drawn into corruption than defended from it; and I think that Monarchy can be said to be natural in no other sense, than that our deprav'd Nature is most in∣clin'd to that which is worst.</P>
<P>To avoid unnecessary Disputes, I give the name of Popular Govern∣ments to those of <HI>Rome, Athens, Sparta,</HI> and the like, tho improperly, unless the same may also be given to many that are usually called Monar∣chys, since there is nothing of violence in either; the Power is confer'd upon the chief Magistrats of both by the free consent of a willing People, and such a part as they think fit is still retain'd and executed in their own Assemblys; and in this sense it is that our Author seems to speak against them. As to Popular Government in the strictest sense, (that is pure De∣mocracy, where the People in themselves, and by themselves, perform all that belong to Government) I know of no such thing; and if it be in the World, have nothing to say for it. In asserting the Liberty, generally, as I suppose, granted by God to all mankind, I neither deny, that so ma∣ny as think fit to enter into a Society, may give so much of their Power as they please to one or more men, for a time or perpetually, to them and their Heirs, according to such Rules as they prescribe; nor approve the Disorders that must arise if they keep it intirely in their own hands. And looking upon the several Governments, which under different forms and names have bin regularly constituted by Nations, as so many undeniable Te∣stimonys, that they thought it good for themselves and their Posterity so to do, I infer, that as there is no man who would not rather chuse to be go∣vern'd by such as are just, industrious, valiant and wise, than by those that are wicked, slothful, cowardly and foolish; and to live in society with such as are qualify'd like those of the first sort, rather than with those who will be ever ready to commit all manner of Villanys, or want experience, strength or courage, to join in repelling the Injurys offer'd by others: So there are none who do not according to the measure of their understand∣ing, endeavour to set up those who seem to be best qualify'd, and to pre∣vent the introduction of those Vices which render the Faith of the Ma∣gistrate suspected, or make him unable to perform his duty, in providing for the execution of Justice, and the publick defence of the State against Foreign or Domestick Enemys. For as no man who is not absolutely mad, will commit the care of a Flock to a Villain, that has neither skill, diligence, nor courage to defend them, or perhaps is maliciously set to de∣stroy them, rather than to a stout, faithful, and wise Shepherd; 'tis less to be imagin'd that any would commit the same error in relation to that Soci∣ety which comprehends himself with his Children, Friends, and all that is dear to him.</P>
<P>The same Considerations are of equal force in relation to the Body of every Nation: For since the Magistrate, tho the most perfect in his kind, cannot perform his duty, if the people be so base, vicious, effeminate and cowardly, as not to second his good Intentions; those who expect good from him, cannot desire so to corrupt their Companions that are to help him, as to render it impossible for him to accomplish it. Tho I believe there have bin in all Ages bad men in every Nation, yet I doubt whether there was
<PB N="133" REF="141"/>
one in <HI>Rome,</HI> except a <HI>Catiline</HI> or a <HI>Cesar</HI> who design'd to make themselves Tyrants, that would not rather have wish'd the whole People as brave and vertuous as in the time of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Wars, than vile and base as in the days of <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Domitian.</HI> But 'tis madness to think, that the whole Body would not rather wish to be as it was when Vertue flou∣rish'd and nothing upon Earth was able to resist their power, than weak, miserable, base, slavish, and trampled under foot by any that would in∣vade them; and forc'd as a Chattel to become a prey to those that were strongest. Which is sufficient to shew, that a People acting according to the liberty of their own Will, never advance unworthy men, unless it be by mistake, nor willingly suffer the introduction of Vices: Whereas the Absolute Monarch always prefers the worst of those who are addicted to him, and cannot subsist unless the prevailing part of the People be base and vicious.</P>
<P>If it be said, that those Governments in which the Democratical part governs most, do more frequently err in the choice of men, or the means of preserving that purity of Manners which is requir'd for the well-being of a People, than those wherein Aristocracy prevails; I confess it, and that in <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> the best and wisest men did for the most part incline to Aristocracy. <HI>Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Cicero,</HI> and others, were of this sort: But if our Author there seek Pa∣trons for his Absolute Monarchy, he will find none but <HI>Phalaris, Agatho∣cles, Dionysius, Catiline, Cethegus, Lentulus,</HI> with the corrupted Crew of mercenary Rascals, who did, or endeavor'd to set 'em up. These are they <HI>quibus ex honesto nulla est spes;</HI> they abhor the Dominion of the Law, because it curbs their Vices, and make themselves subservient to the Lusts of a man who may nourish them. Similitude of Interests, Manners, and Designs, is a link of Union between them: Both are Enemys to po∣pular and mix'd Government; and those Governments are Enemys to them, and by preserving Vertue and Integrity, oppose both; know∣ing, that if they do not, they and their Governments must certainly pe∣rish.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XX. Man's natural love to Liberty is temper'd by Reason, which originally is his Nature.</HEAD>
<P>THAT our Author's Book may appear to be a heap of Incongrui∣tys and Contradictions, 'tis not amiss to add to what has already bin observ'd, that having asserted Absolute Monarchy to be <HI>the only natu∣ral Government,</HI> he now says, <HI>that the nature of all People is to desire Li∣berty without restraint.</HI> But if Monarchy be that Power which above all restrains Liberty, and subjects all to the Will of one; this is as much as to say, that all People naturally desire that which is against Nature; and by a wonderful excess of extravagance and folly to assert contrary Propo∣sitions, that on both sides are equally absurd and false. For as we have already prov'd that no Government is impos'd upon men by God or Na∣ture, 'tis no less evident, that Man being a rational Creature, nothing can be universally natural to him, that is not rational. But this Liberty without restraint being inconsistent with any Government, and the
<PB N="134" REF="142"/>
 Good which man naturally desires for himself, Children and Friends, we find no place in the world where the Inhabitants do not enter into some kind of Society or Government to restrain it: and to say that all men desire Liberty without restraint, and yet that all do restrain it, is ridi∣culous. The truth is, man is hereunto led by Reason which is his Na∣ture. Every one sees they cannot well live asunder, nor many together, without some Rule to which all must submit. This submission is a re∣straint of Liberty, but could be of no effect as to the Good intended, un∣less it were general; nor general, unless it were natural. When all are born to the same freedom, some will not resign that which is their own, unless others do the like: This general consent of all to resign such a part of their Liberty as seems to be for the good of all, is the voice of Na∣ture, and the act of Men (according to natural Reason) seeking their own Good: And if all go not in the same way, according to the same form, 'tis an evident testimony that no one is directed by Nature; but as a few or many may join together, and frame smaller or greater Societys, so those Societys may institute such an order or form of Government as best pleases themselves; and if the ends of Government are obtain'd, they all equally follow the voice of Nature in constituting them.</P>
<P>Again, if man were by nature so tenacious of his Liberty without re∣straint, he must be rationally so. The creation of Absolute Monarchys, which intirely extinguishes it, must necessarily be most contrary to it, tho the people were willing; for they thereby abjure their own Nature. The usurpation of them can be no less than the most abominable and out∣rageous violation of the Laws of Nature that can be imagin'd: The Laws of God must be in the like measure broken; and of all Govern∣ments, Democracy, in which every man's Liberty is least restrain'd, be∣cause every man has an equal part, would certainly prove to be the most just, rational and natural; whereas our Author represents it as a perpe∣tual spring of disorder, confusion and vice. This consequence would be unavoidable, if he said true; but it being my fate often to differ from him, I hope to be excus'd if I do so in this also, and affirm, that nothing but the plain and certain dictates of Reason can be generally applicable to all men as the Law of their Nature; and they who, according to the best of their understanding provide for the good of themselves and their Posterity, do all equally observe it. He that inquires more exactly into the matter may find, that Reason enjoins every man not to arrogate to himself more than he allows to others, nor to retain that Liberty which will prove hurtful to him; or to expect that others will suffer themselves to be restrain'd, whilst he, to their prejudice, remains in the exercise of that freedom which Nature allows. He who would be exempted from this common Rule, must shew for what reason he should be rais'd above his Brethren; and if he dos it not, he is an enemy to them. This is not Popularity, but Tyranny; and Tyrants are said <HI>exuisse hominem,</HI> to throw off the Nature of men, because they do unjustly and unreasonably as∣sume to themselves that which agrees not with the frailty of human Na∣ture, and set up an Interest in themselves contrary to that of their Equals, which they ought to defend as their own. Such as favour them are like to them; and we know of no Tyranny that was not set up by the worst, nor of any that have bin destroy'd, unless by the best of men. The se∣veral Tyrannys of <HI>Syracuse</HI> were introduc'd by <HI>Agathocles, Dionysius, Hieronymus, Hippocrates, Epicides,</HI> and others, by the help of lend, dis∣solute, mercenary Villains; and overthrown by <HI>Timoleon, Dion, Theo∣dorus,</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>
and others, whose Vertues will be remember'd in all ages. These, and others like to them, never sought liberty without restraint, but such as was restrain'd by Laws tending to the publick Good; that all might concur in promoting it, and the unruly desires of those who affected Power and Honours which they did not deserve might be represt.</P>
<P>The like was seen in <HI>Rome:</HI> When <HI>Brutus, Valerius,</HI> and other ver∣tuous Citizens had thrown out the leud <HI>Tarquins,</HI> they trusted to their own innocence and reputation; and thinking them safe under the pro∣tection of the Law, contented themselves with such Honors as their Countrymen thought they deserv'd. This would not satisfy the disso∣lute crew that us'd to be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sodales adolescentium Tarquiniorum assueti more Regio vivere, eam tum aequato jure omnium licentiam quaerentes, libertatem aliorum in suam vertisse servitutem conquerebantur.

Liv. l. <HI>2.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>companions to the <HI>Tarquins.</HI> I cannot say that either of these sought a Liberty without restraint; for the vertuous were willing to be restrain'd by the Law, and the vicious to submit to the Will of a man, to gain impunity in offending. But if our Author says true, the licentious fury of these leud young men, who endeavour'd to subvert the Constitution of their Country to procure the impunity of their own Crimes, would have bin more natural, that is more reasonable than the ordinary proceedings of the most vertuous, who desir'd that the Law might be the rule of their Actions, which is most absurd.</P>
<P>The like vicious Wretches have in all times endeavour'd to put the Power into the hands of one man, who might protect 'em in their Villanys, and advance 'em to exorbitant Riches or undeserv'd Honors; whilst the best men trusting in their Innocence, and desiring no other Riches or Pre∣ferments than what by their Equals they were thought to deserve, were contented with a due Liberty, under the protection of a just Law: and I must transcribe the Historys of the World, or at least so much of them as concerns the Tyrannys that have bin set up or cast down, if I should here insert all the proofs that might be given of it. But I shall come nearer to the point, which is not to compare Democracy with Monarchy, but a regular mix'd Government with such an Absolute Monarchy, as leaves all to the will of that Man, Woman, or Child, who happens to be born in the reigning Family, how ill soever they may be qualify'd. I desire those who are lovers of Truth to consider, whether the wisest, best, and bravest of Men, are not naturally led to be pleas'd with a Go∣verment that protects them from receiving wrong, when they have not the least inclination to do any? Whether they who desire no unjust ad∣vantage above their Brethren, will not always desire that a People or Se∣nat constituted as that of <HI>Rome,</HI> from the expulsion of <HI>Tarquin</HI> to the setting up of <HI>Cesar,</HI> should rather judg of their Merit, than <HI>Tarquin, Cesar,</HI> or his Successors? Or whether the leud or corrupted Pretorian, Bands, with <HI>Macro, Sejanus, Tigellinus,</HI> and the like, commanding them will not ever, like <HI>Brutus</HI> his Sons, abhor the inexorable Power of the Laws, with the necessity of living only by their innocence, and favour the Interest of Princes like to those that advanc'd them? If this be not sufficient, they may be pleas'd a little to reflect upon the Affairs of our own Country, and seriously consider whether <HI>H—de, Cl—f—d, F-lm th, Arl-ng-n</HI> and <HI>D—nby,</HI> could have pretended to the chief places, if the
<PB N="136" REF="144"/>
 disposal of them had bin in a free and well-regulated Parliament? Whe∣ther they did most resemble <HI>Brutus, Publicola,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Va∣lerii,</HI> the <HI>Fabii, Quintii, Cornelii,</HI> &amp;c. or <HI>Narcissus, Pallas, Icetus, Laco, Vinnius,</HI> and the like? Whether all men, good and bad, do not favour that state of things, which favours them and such as they are? Whether <HI>Cl-v-l-d, P-rtsm-th,</HI> and others of the same trade, have attain'd to the Riches and Honors they enjoy by Services done to the Commonwealth? And what places <HI>Chiffinch, F—x</HI> and <HI>Jenkins,</HI> could probably have at∣tain'd, if our Affairs had bin regulated as good men desire? Whether the old Arts of begging, stealing and bawding, or the new ones of informing and trepanning, thrive best under one man who may be weak or vicious, and is always subject to be circumvented by Flatterers, or under the se∣vere scrutinys of a Senat or People? In a word, whether they who live by such Arts, and know no other, do not always endeavour to advance the Government under which they enjoy, or may hope to obtain the high∣est Honors, and abhor that, in which they are expos'd to all manner of scorn and punishment? Which being determin'd, it will easily appear why the worst men have ever bin for Absolute Monarchy, and the best against it; and which of the two in so doing can be said to desire an un∣restrain'd Liberty of doing that which is evil.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXI. Mix'd and Popular Governments preserve Peace, and manage Wars, better than Absolute Monarchys.</HEAD>
<P>BEing no way concern'd in the defence of Democracy; and having prov'd that <HI>Xenophon, Thucydides,</HI> and others of the Antients, in speaking against the over-great Power of the common People, intended to add Reputation to the Aristocratical Party to which they were addicted, and not to set up Absolute Monarchy, which never fell under discourse among them, but as an object of scorn and hatred, evil in it self, and only to be endur'd by base and barbarous People; I may leave our Knight, like <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> fighting against the Phantasms of his own brain, and saying what he pleases against such Governments as never were, unless in such a place as <HI>San Marino</HI> near <HI>Sinigaglia</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> where a hundred Clowns go∣vern a barbarous Rock that no man invades, and relates nothing to our question. If his Doctrin be true, the Monarchy he extols is not only to be prefer'd before unruly Democracy, and mix'd Governments, but is the only one that, without a gross violation of the Laws of God and Na∣ture, can be establish'd over any Nation. But having, as I hope, suf∣ficiently prov'd, that God did neither institute, nor appoint any such to be instituted, nor approve those that were; that Nature dos not incline us to it, and that the best as well as the wisest men have always abhor'd it; that it has bin agreeable only to the most stupid and base Nations; and if others have submitted to it; they have done so only as to the great∣est of Evils brought upon them by Violence, Corruption or Fraud; I may now proceed to shew that the Progress of it has bin in all respects sutable to its beginning.</P>
<P>To this end 'twill not be amiss to examin our Author's words. <HI>Thus,</HI> says he, <HI>do they paint to the life this Beast with many heads: Let me give</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="145"/>
<HI>the Cypher of their Form of Government; as it is begot by Sedition, so it is nourish'd by Crimes: It can never stand without Wars, either with an Enemy abroad, or with Friends at home.</HI> And in order to this I will not criticize upon the terms, tho the Cypher of a Form, and War with Friends, may be justly call'd Nonsense; but coming to his Assertions, that popular or mix'd Governments have their birth in Sedition, and are ever after∣terwards vex'd with Civil or Foreign Wars, I take liberty to say, That whereas there is no Form appointed by God or Nature, those Govern∣ments only can be call'd Just, which are establish'd by the consent of Na∣tions. These Nations may at the first set up popular or mix'd Govern∣ments, and without the guilt of Sedition introduce them afterwards, if that which was first establish'd prove unprofitable or hurtful to them; and those that have done so, have enjoy'd more Justice in times of Peace, and managed Wars, when occasion requir'd, with more vertue and bet∣ter success, than any Absolute Monarchys have done. And whereas he says, that <HI>in popular Governments each man has a care of his particular, and thinks basely of the common Good; They look upon approaching Mischiefs as they do upon Thunder, only every man wishes it may not touch his own Person:</HI> I say, that men can no otherwise be engag'd to take care of the Publick, than by having such a part in it, as Absolute Monarchy dos not allow; for under it they can neither obtain the Good for themselves, Posterity and Friends, that they desire, nor prevent the Mischiefs they fear, which are the principal Arguments that persuade men to expose themselves to la∣bours or dangers. 'Tis a folly to say, that the vigilance and wisdom of the Monarch supplies the defect of care in others; for we know that no men under the Sun were ever more void of both, and all manner of ver∣tue requir'd to such a work, than very many Monarchs have bin: And, which is yet worse, the strength and happiness of the People being fre∣quently dangerous to them, they have not so much as the will to pro∣mote it: nay, sometimes set themselves to destroy it. Antient Monar∣chys afford us frequent examples of this kind; and if we consider those of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turky,</HI> which seem most to flourish in our Age, the People will appear to be so miserable under both, that they cannot fear any change of Governor or Government; and all, except a few Ministers, are kept so far from the knowledg of, or power in the management of Affairs, that if any of them should fancy a possibility of something that might befal them worse than what they suffer, or hope for that which might allevi∣ate their misery, they could do nothing towards the advancement of the one, or prevention of the other. <HI>Tacitus</HI> observes, that in his time no man was able to write what past, <HI>Inscitia Reipublicae ut alienae.</HI> They <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. An. l. 1.</NOTE>neglected the publick Affairs in which they had no part. In the same Age it was said, that the People, who whilst they fought for their own Interests had bin invincible, being enslav'd, were grown sordid, idle, base, running after Stage-plays and Shows; so as the whole strength of the <HI>Roman</HI> Armys consisted of Strangers. When their Spirits were de∣prest by servitude, they had neither courage to defend themselves, nor will to fight for their wicked Masters; and least of all to increase their Power, which was destructive to themselves. The same thing is found in all places. Tho the <HI>Turk</HI> commands many vast Provinces, that natu∣rally produce as good Soldiers as any, yet his greatest strength is in Chil∣dren that do not know their Fathers; who not being very many in num∣ber, may perish in one Battel, and the Empire by that means be lost, the miserable Nations that groan under that Tyranny having neither courage,
<PB N="138" REF="146"/>
 power, nor will to defend it. This was the fate of the <HI>Mamalukes.</HI> They had for the space of almost two hundred years domineer'd in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Asia;</HI> but the people under them being weak and disaf∣fected, they could never recover the Defeat they received from <HI>Selim</HI> near <HI>Tripoli,</HI> who pursuing his Victory, in a few months utterly abolish'd their Kingdom.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the present Pride of <HI>France,</HI> the numbers and war∣like Inclinations of that People, the bravery of the Nobility, extent of Dominion, convenience of Situation, and the vast Revenues of their King, his greatest Advantages have bin gain'd by the mistaken Counsels of <HI>England,</HI> the valor of our Soldiers unhappily sent to serve him, and the Strangers of whom the strength of his Armys consists; which is so unsteddy a support, that many who are well vers'd in Affairs of this na∣ture, incline to think he subsists rather by little Arts, and corrupting Mi∣nisters in Foreign Courts, than by the Power of his own Armys; and that some reformation in the Counsels of his Neighbours might prove sufficient to overthrow that Greatness which is grown formidable to <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI> the same misery to which he has reduc'd his People, rendring them as unable to defend him, upon any change of Fortune, as to defend their own Rights against him.</P>
<P>This proceeds not from any particular defect in the <HI>French</HI> Government, but that which is common to all Absolute Monarchys. And no State can be said to stand upon a steddy Foundation, except those whose strength is in their own Soldiery, and the body of their own People. Such as serve for Wages, often betray their Masters in distress, and always want the courage and industry which is found in those who fight for their own Interests, and are to have a part in the Victory. The business of Mer∣cenarys is so to perform their duty as to keep their Employments, and to draw profit from them; but that is not enough to support the Spirits of men in extreme dangers. The Shepherd who is a hireling, flies when the Thief comes; and this adventitious help failing, all that a Prince can reasonably expect from a disaffected and opprest People is, that they should bear the Yoke patiently in the time of his Prosperity; but upon the change of his Fortune they leave him to shift for himself, or join with his Enemys to avenge the Injurys they had receiv'd. Thus did <HI>Al∣phonso</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> Kings of <HI>Naples,</HI> and <HI>Lodovico Sforza</HI> Duke of <HI>Mi∣lan</HI> fall in the times of <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth and <HI>Louis</HI> the Twelfth, Kings of <HI>France.</HI> The two first had bin false, violent, and cruel; nothing within their Kingdom could oppose their fury: but when they were in∣vaded by a foreign Power, they lost all, as <HI>Guicciardin</HI> says, without breaking one Lance; and <HI>Sforza</HI> was by his own mercenary Soldiers de∣liver'd into the hands of his Enemys.</P>
<P>I think it may be hard to find Examples of such as proceeding in the same way have had better Success: But if it should so fall out, that a Peo∣ple living under an Absolute Monarchy, should thro custom, or fear of something worse (if that can be) not only suffer patiently, but desire to uphold the Government; neither the Nobility, nor Commonalty can do any thing towards it. They are strangers to all publick Concern∣ments: All things are govern'd by one, or a sew men, and others know nothing either of Action or Counsel. <HI>Filmer</HI> will tell us 'tis no matter; the profound Wisdom of the Prince provides for all. But what if this Prince be a Child, a Fool, a superannuated Dotard, or a Madman? Or if he dos not fall under any of these extremitys, and possesses such a
<PB N="139" REF="147"/>
proportion of Wit, Industry, and Courage as is ordinarily seen in men, how shall he supply the Office that indeed requires profound Wisdom, and an equal measure of Experience and Valor? 'Tis to no purpose to say a good Council may supply his defects; for it dos not appear how he should come by this Council, nor who should oblige him to follow their advice: If he be left to his own will to do what he pleases, tho good advice be given to him; yet his judgment being perverted, he will always incline to the worst: If a necessity be impos'd upon him of act∣ing according to the advice of his Council, he is not that absolute Mo∣narch of whom we speak, nor the Government Monarchical, but Ari∣stocratical. These are imperfect Figleave coverings of Nakedness. It was in vain to give good Counsel to <HI>Sardanapalus;</HI> and none could defend the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Empire, when he lay wallowing amongst his Whores, with∣out any other thought than of his Lusts. None could preserve <HI>Rome,</HI> when <HI>Domitian</HI>'s chief business was to kill Flies, and that of <HI>Honorius</HI> to take care of his Hens. The Monarchy of <HI>France</HI> must have perish'd under the base Kings they call <HI>Les Roys faineants,</HI> if the Scepter had not bin wrested out of their unworthy hands. The World is full of Exam∣ples in this kind: and when it pleases God to bestow a just, wise, and valiant King as a blessing upon a Nation, 'tis only a momentary help, his Vertues end with him; and there being neither any divine Promise nor human Reason, moving us to believe that they shall always be renew'd and continu'd in his Successors, men cannot rely upon it; and to alledg a possibility of such a thing is nothing to the purpose.</P>
<P>On the other side, in a popular or mix'd Government every man is concern'd: Every one has a part according to his quality or merit; all changes are prejudicial to all: Whatsoever any man conceives to be for the publick good, he may propose it in the Magistracy, or to the Ma∣gistrate: The body of the People is the publick defence, and every man is arm'd and disciplin'd: the advantages of good success are communi∣cated to all, and every one bears a part in the losses. This makes men generous and industrious, and fills their hearts with Love to their Coun∣try: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amor patriae, laudisque immensa cupido. <BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></NOTE>This, and the desire of that praise which is the Reward of Vertue, rais'd the <HI>Romans</HI> above the rest of Mankind; and wheresoever the same ways are taken, they will in a great measure have the same effects. By this means they had as many Soldiers to fight for their Country as there were Freemen in it. Whilst they had to deal with the free Nations of <HI>Italy, Greece, Africa</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> they never conquer'd a Country, till the Inhabitants were exhausted: But when they came to fight against Kings, the success of a Battel was enough to bring a Kingdom under their power. <HI>Antiochus</HI> upon a ruffle receiv'd from <HI>Acilius</HI> at <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> left all that he possest in <HI>Greece;</HI> and being defeated by <HI>Scipio Nasica,</HI> he quitted all the Kingdoms and Territorys of <HI>Asia</HI> on this side <HI>Taurus. Paulus Emilius</HI> became Master of <HI>Macedon</HI> by one prosperous fight against <HI>Perses. Sy∣phax, Gentius, Tigranes, Ptolomy,</HI> and others, were more easily subdu'd. The mercenary Armys on which they rely'd being broken, the Citys and Countrys not caring for their Masters, submitted to those who had more vertue, and better fortune. If the <HI>Roman</HI> Power had not bin built upon a more sure foundation, they could not have subsisted. Notwith∣standing their Valor, they were often beaten; but their losses were imme∣diately
<PB N="140" REF="148"/>
 repair'd by the excellence of their Disciplin. When <HI>Hannibal</HI> had gain'd the Battels of <HI>Trebia, Ticinum, Thrasimene,</HI> and <HI>Cannae;</HI> defeated the <HI>Romans</HI> in many other Encounters, and slain above two hundred thousand of their Men, with <HI>Paulus Emilius, C. Servilius, Sempronius Gracchus, Quintius, Marcellus,</HI> and many other excellent Commanders: When about the same time the two brave <HI>Scipio</HI>'s had bin cut off with their Armys in <HI>Spain,</HI> and many great Losses had bin sustain'd in <HI>Sicily</HI> and by Sea, one would have thought it impossible for the City to have resisted: But their Vertue, love to their Country, and good Government was a strength that increas'd under all their Calamitys, and in the end overcame all. The nearer <HI>Hannibal</HI> came to the Walls, the more obsti∣nate was their resistance. Tho he had kill'd more great Captains than any Kingdom ever had, others daily step'd up in their place, who excel'd them in all manner of Vertue. I know not, if at any time that con∣quering City could glory in a greater number of men fit for the highest En∣terprises, than at the end of that cruel War, which had consum'd so ma∣ny of them; but I think that the finishing Victorys by them obtain'd, are but ill proofs of our Author's assertion, that they <HI>thought basely of the common Good, and sought only to save themselves.</HI> We know of none ex∣cept <HI>Cecilius Metellus,</HI> who after the Battel of <HI>Cannae</HI> had so base a thought as to design the withdrawing himself from the publick ruin; but <HI>Scipio</HI> (afterwards sirnam'd <HI>Africanus)</HI> threatning death to those who would not swear never to abandon their Country, forc'd him to leave it. This may in general be imputed to good Government and Disciplin, with which all were so season'd from their infancy, that no affection was so rooted in them, as an ardent love to their Country, and a resolution to die for it, or with it; but the means by which they accomplish'd their great Ends, so as after their defeats to have such men as carry'd on their noblest Designs with more glory than ever, was their annual Elections of Magistrats, many being thereby advanc'd to the supreme Commands, and every one by the Honors he enjoy'd, fill'd with a desire of rendring him∣self worthy of them.</P>
<P>I should not much insist upon these things, if they had bin seen only in <HI>Rome:</HI> but tho their Disciplin seems to have bin more perfect, better observ'd, and to have produc'd a Vertue that surpast all others; the like has bin found, tho perhaps not in the same degree, in all Nations that have enjoy'd their Liberty, and were admitted to such a part of the Go∣vernment, as might give them a love to it. This was evident in all the Nations of <HI>Italy.</HI> The <HI>Sabins, Volsci, Aequi, Tuscans, Samnites</HI> and o∣thers, were never conquer'd, till they had no men left. The <HI>Samnites</HI> alone inhabiting a small and barren Province, suffer'd more defeats before they were subdu'd, than all the Kingdoms of <HI>Numidia, Aegypt, Mace∣don,</HI> and <HI>Asia;</HI> and, as 'tis exprest in their Embassy to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> never yielded, till they who had brought vast numbers of men into the Field, and by them defeated some of the <HI>Roman</HI> Armys, were reduc'd to such weakness, that they could not resist one Legion. We hear of sew <HI>Spar∣tans</HI> who did not willingly expose their Lives for the service of their Country; and the Women themselves were so far inflam'd with the same affection, that they refus'd to mourn for their Children and Husbands who dy'd in the defence of it. When the brave <HI>Brasidas</HI> was slain, some eminent men went to comfort his Mother upon the news of his death; and telling her he was the most valiant man in the City, she <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thucyd. de Bell. Pelopon.</NOTE>answer'd, that he was indeed a valiant man, and dy'd as he ought to do,
<PB N="141" REF="149"/>
but that thro the goodness of the Gods, many others were left as valiant as he.</P>
<P>When <HI>Xerxes</HI> invaded <HI>Greece,</HI> there was not a Citizen of <HI>Athens</HI> able to bear Arms, who did not leave his Wife and Children to shift for them∣selves in the neighbouring Citys, and their Houses to be burnt when they imbark'd with <HI>Themistocles;</HI> and never thought of either till they had de∣feated the <HI>Barbarians</HI> at <HI>Salamis</HI> by Sea, and at <HI>Platea</HI> by Land. When men are thus spirited, some will ever prove excellent: and as none did ever sur∣pass those who are bred under this disciplin in all moral, military and civil Vertues; those very Countrys where they flourish'd most, have not pro∣duc'd any eminent men since they lost that Liberty which was the Mo∣ther and Nurse of them.</P>
<P>Tho I should fill a Volume with examples of this kind (as I might ea∣sily do) such as our Author will say, that in Popular Governments men look upon Mischiefs as Thunder, and only wish it may not touch them∣selves: But leaving them to the scorn and hatred they deserve by their impudence and folly, I conclude this point with the answer, that <HI>Trajano</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ragion. 99.</NOTE><HI>Boccalini</HI> puts into the mouth of <HI>Apollo,</HI> to the Princes who complain'd that their Subjects had not that love to their Countrys, as had bin, and was daily seen in those who liv'd under Commonwealths; which amounted to no more than to tell them, that their ill Government was the cause of that defect, and that the prejudices incur'd by Rapine, Violence, and Fraud, were to be repair'd only by Liberality, Justice, and such a care of their Subjects, that they might live happily under them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXII. Commonwealths seek Peace or War according to the Variety of their Constitutions.</HEAD>
<P>IF I have hitherto spoken in general of popular or mix'd Govern∣ments, as if they were all founded on the same principle, it was only because our Author without distinction has generally blam'd them all, and generally imputed to every one those Faults, which perhaps never were many; but most certainly are directly opposite to the temper and constitu∣tion of many among them. Malice and Ignorance reign so equally in him, that 'tis not easy to determin from which of the two this false repre∣sentation proceeds. But lest any man should thereby be impos'd upon, 'tis time to observe, That the Constitutions of Commonwealths have bin so various, according to the different temper of Nations and Times, that if some of them seem to have bin principally constituted for War, others have as much delighted in Peace; and many having taken the middle, and (as some think) the best way, have so moderated their love to Peace, as not to suffer the Spirits of the People to fall, but kept them in a perpe∣tual readiness to make War when there was occasion: and every one of those having follow'd several ways and ends, deserve our particular consi∣deration.</P>
<P>The Citys of <HI>Rome, Sparta, Thebes,</HI> and all the Associations of the <HI>Eto∣lians, Achaians, Sabins, Latins, Samnites,</HI> and many others that antient∣ly flourish'd in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> seem to have intended nothing but the just preservation of Liberty at home, and making War abroad. All the Na∣tions
<PB N="142" REF="150"/>
 of <HI>Spain, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Gaul</HI> sought the same things. Their prin∣cipal work was to render their People valiant, obedient to their Com∣manders, lovers of their Country, and always ready to fight for it: And for this reason when the Senators of <HI>Rome</HI> had kill'd <HI>Romulus,</HI> they per∣suaded <HI>Julius Proculus</HI> to affirm, that he had seen him in a most glorious form ascending to Heaven, and promising great things to the City, <HI>Proinde rem militarem colant.</HI> The <HI>Athenians</HI> were not less inclin'd to War, but apply'd themselves to Trade, as subservient to that end, by increasing the number of the People, and furnishing them with the means of carrying it on with more vigor and power. The <HI>Phenician</HI> Citys, of which <HI>Car∣thage</HI> was the most eminent, follow'd the same method; but knowing that Riches do not defend themselves, or scorning slothfully to enjoy what was gain'd by Commerce, they so far apply'd themselves to War, that they grew to a Power, which <HI>Rome</HI> only was able to overthrow. <HI>Ve∣nice, Florence, Genoa, Lucca,</HI> and some other Citys of <HI>Italy</HI> seem chiefly to have aim'd at Trade; and placing the hopes of their safety in the pro∣tection of more powerful States, have unwillingly enter'd into Wars, especially by Land; and when they did, they made them by mercenary Soldiers.</P>
<P>Again, some of those that intended War desir'd to enlarge their Terri∣torys by conquest; others only to preserve their own, and to live with freedom and safety upon them. <HI>Rome</HI> was of the first sort; and know∣ing that such ends cannot be accomplish'd without great numbers of men, they freely admitted Strangers into the City, Senat, and Magistracy. <HI>Nu∣ma</HI> was a <HI>Sabin: Tarquinius Priscus</HI> was the Son of a <HI>Grecian:</HI> One hundred of those <HI>Sabins</HI> who came with <HI>Tatius</HI> were admitted into the Senat: <HI>Appi∣us Claudius</HI> of the same People came to <HI>Rome,</HI> was made a Member of the Senat, and created Consul. They demolish'd several Citys, and brought the Inhabitants to their own; gave the right of Citizens to many others (some∣times to whole Citys and Provinces) and car'd not how many they re∣ceiv'd, so they could engraft them upon the same interest with the old stock, and season them with the same Principles, Disciplin, and Man∣ners. On the other side, the <HI>Spartans</HI> desiring only to continue free, ver∣tuous, and safe in the enjoyment of their own Territory; and thinking themselves strong enough to defend it, fram'd a most severe Disciplin, to which few Strangers would submit. They banish'd all those curious Arts, that are useful to Trade; prohibited the importation of Gold and Silver; appointed the <HI>Helotes</HI> to cultivate their Lands, and to exercise such Trades as are necessary to life; admitted few Strangers to live amongst them; made none of them free of their City, and educated their Youth in such exer∣cises only as prepar'd them for War. I will not take upon me to judg whether this proceeded from such a moderation of Spirit, as plac'd Felicity rather in the fulness and stability of Liberty, Integrity, Vertue, and the enjoyment of their own, than in Riches, Power, and Dominion over others; nor which of these two different methods deserves most to be commended: But certain it is that both succeeded according to the inten∣tion of the Founders.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> conquer'd the best part of the World, and never wanted men to defend what was gain'd: <HI>Sparta</HI> liv'd in such happiness and reputation, that till it was invaded by <HI>Epimanondas,</HI> an Enemys Trumpet had not bin heard by those within the Town for the space of eight hundred years, and never suffer'd any great disaster, till receding from their own Institu∣tions, they were brought by prosperity to affect the principality of <HI>Greece,</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="151"/>
and to undertake such Wars as could not be carry'd on without Mony, and greater numbers of men than a small City was able to furnish; by which means they were oblig'd to beg assistance from the Barba∣rians, whom they scorn'd and hated, as appears by the Storys of <HI>Callicra∣tidas, Lysander,</HI> and <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> and fell into such straits as were never re∣cover'd.</P>
<P>The like variety has bin observ'd in the Constitutions of those Nor∣thern Nations that invaded the Roman Empire: for tho all of them in∣tended War, and look'd upon those only to be Members of their Com∣monwealths who us'd arms to defend them, yet some did immediately incorporate themselves with those of the conquer'd Countrys. Of this number were the <HI>Franks,</HI> who presently became one Nation with the <HI>Gauls;</HI> others kept themselves in a distinct Body, as the <HI>Saxons</HI> did from the <HI>Britains:</HI> And the <HI>Goths</HI> for more than three hundred years that they reign'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> never contracted Marriages, or otherwise mix'd with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> till their Kingdom was overthrown by the <HI>Moors.</HI></P>
<P>These things, and others of the like nature, being weigh'd, many have doubted whether it were better to constitute a Commonwealth for War or for Trade; and of such as intend War, whether those are most to be prais'd who prepare for defence only, or those who design by con∣quest to enlarge their Dominions. Or, if they admit of Trade, whe∣ther they should propose the acquisition of Riches for their ultimate end, and depend upon foreign or mercenary Forces to defend them; or to be as helps to enable their own People to carry on those Wars in which they may be frequently engag'd. These Questions might perhaps be easily decid∣ed, if Mankind were of a temper to suffer those to live in peace, who of∣fer no injury to any; or that men who have Mony to hire Soldiers when they stand in need of them, could find such as would valiantly and faith∣fully defend them, whilst they apply themselves to their Trades. But experience teaching us that those only can be safe who are strong; and that no People was ever well defended but those who fought for themselves; the best Judges of these matters have always given the preference to those Constitutions that principally intend War, and make use of Trade as assist∣ing to that end: and think it better to aim at conquest, rather than sim∣ply to stand upon their own defence; since he that loses all if he be over∣come, sights upon very unequal terms; and if he obtain the Victory, gains no other advantage, than for the present to repel the danger that threaten'd him.</P>
<P>These Opinions are confirm'd by the examples of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who prosper'd much more than the <HI>Spartans:</HI> And the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> who made use of Trade as a help to War, rais'd their City to be one of the most potent that ever was in the World: Whereas the <HI>Venetians</HI> having rely'd on Trade and mercenary Soldiers, are always forc'd too much to depend upon foreign Potentats; very often to buy Peace with ignomi∣nious and prejudicial conditions; and sometimes to fear the infidelity of their own Commanders, no less than the violence of their Enemys. But that which ought to be valu'd above all in point of Wisdom as well as Justice, is the Government given by God to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> which chiefly fitted them for War, and to make Conquests. <HI>Moses</HI> divided them un∣der several Captains, into thousands, hundreds, fiftys, and tens: This was a perpetual Ordinance amongst them: In numbring them, those only were counted, who were able to bear arms: Every man was oblig'd to go out to War, except such as had marry'd a Wife, or upon other
<PB N="144" REF="152"/>
 special occasions were for a time excus'd; and the whole series of the sa∣cred History shews that there were always as many Soldiers to fight for their Country as there were men able to fight. And if this be taken for a Picture of a many-headed Beast delighting in Blood, begotten by Sedi∣tion, and nourish'd by Crimes, God himself was the drawer of it.</P>
<P>In this variety of Constitutions, and Effects proceeding from them, I can see nothing more justly and generally to be attributed to them all, than that Love to their Country, which our Author impudently affirms to be wanting in all. In other matters their proceedings are not only diffe∣rent, but contrary to each other: yet it cannot be said that any Nations have injoy'd so much Peace as some Republicks. The <HI>Venetians</HI> too great inclination to Peace is accounted to be a mortal error in their Constitu∣tion; and they have not bin less free from domestick Seditions than fo∣reign Wars: the Conspiracys of the <HI>Falerii</HI> and <HI>Tiepoli</HI> were extinguish'd by their punishment, and that of <HI>La Cueva</HI> crush'd before it was ripe. <HI>Genoa</HI> has not bin altogether so happy: the factions of the <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Ghibelins</HI> that spread themselves over all <HI>Italy,</HI> infected that City; and the malice of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French</HI> rais'd others under the <HI>Fregosi</HI> and <HI>Adorni;</HI> but they being compos'd, they have for more than a hundred and fifty years rested in quiet.</P>
<P>There is another sort of Commonwealth compos'd of many Citys as∣sociated together, and living <HI>aequo jure;</HI> every one retaining and exerci∣sing a Sovereign Power within it self, except in some cases exprest in the Act of Union, or League made between them. These I confess are more hardly preserv'd in Peace. Disputes may arise among them concerning Limits, Jurisdiction, and the like. They cannot always be equally con∣cern'd in the same things. The injurys offer'd to one do not equally af∣fect all. Their Neighbors will sow Divisions among them; and not having a Mother-City to decide their Controversys by her authority, they may be apt to fall into quarrels, especially if they profess Christianity; which having bin split into variety of opinions ever since it was preach'd, and the Papists by their cruelty to such as dissent from them, shewing to all, that there is no other way of defending themselves against them, than by using the same, almost every man is come to think he ought (as far as in him lies) to impose his belief on others, and that he can give no better testimony of his Zeal, than the excess of his violence on that account. Nevertheless the Cantons of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> tho accompany'd with all the most dangerous circumstances that can be imagin'd, being thirteen in number, independent on each other, govern'd in a high degree popular∣ly, professing Christianity differing in most important points; eight of them much influenc'd by the Jesuits, and perpetually excited to War a∣gainst their Brethren by the powerful Crowns of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> have ever since they cast off the insupportable Yoke of the Earls of <HI>Haps∣burg,</HI> enjoy'd more peace than any other State of <HI>Europe,</HI> and from the most inconsiderable people, are grown to such a Power, that the greatest Monarchs do most sollicitously seek their Friendship; and none have dar'd to invade them, since <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> did it to his ruin: and he who for a long time had bin a terror to the great, dangerous, and sub∣til King of <HI>France,</HI> gave by the loss of three Armys and his own life, a lasting testimony of his temerity in assaulting a free and valiant, tho a poor people, fighting in their own quarrel. <HI>Commines</HI> well relates that War; but a vast heap of Bones remaining to this day at <HI>Muret</HI> with this inscription, <HI>Caroli fortissimi Burgundiorum Ducis exercitus Muretum ob∣sidens</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="153"/>
<HI>ab Helvetiis caesus, hoc sui Monumentum reliquit,</HI> best shews the suc∣cess of it. Since that time their greatest Wars have bin for the defence of <HI>Milan;</HI> or such as they have undertaken for pay under the Ensigns of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> that by the use of Arms they may keep up that Courage, Reputation, and Experience which is requir'd for the defence of their own Country. No Government was ever more free from popular Sedi∣tions; the revolts of their Subjects have bin few, weak, and easily sup∣prest; the dissension rais'd by the Jesuits between the Cantons of <HI>Zurich</HI> and <HI>Lucern</HI> was as soon compos'd as the rebellion of the County of <HI>Vaux</HI> against the Canton of <HI>Bern;</HI> and those few of the like nature that have happen'd among them have had the like success: So that <HI>Thuanus</HI> in the History of his time, comprehending about fifty years, and relating the horrid domestick and foreign Wars, that distracted <HI>Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Flanders, England, Scotland, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Transilvania, Muscovy, Turky, Africk,</HI> and other places, has no more to say of them than to shew what Arts had bin in vain us'd to disturb their so much envy'd quiet. But if the modest temper of the People, together with the Wisdom, Justice, and Strength of their Go∣vernment, could not be discompos'd by the measures of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> by the industry of their Embassadors, or the malicious craft of the Jesu∣its, we may safely conclude that their State is as well settled as any thing among men can be, and can hardly comprehend what is like to interrupt it. As much might be said of the Citys of the <HI>Hanseatick</HI> Society, if they had an intire Sovereignty in themselves: But the Citys of the United Provinces in the Low Countrys being every one of them Sovereign with∣in themselves, and many in number, still continuing in their Union in spite of all the endeavours that have bin us'd to divide them, give us an example of such steddiness in practice and principle, as is hardly to be pa∣rallel'd in the world, and that undeniably prove a temper in their Con∣stitutions directly opposite to that which our Author imputes to all popu∣lar Governments: and if the Death of <HI>Barnevelt</HI> and <HI>De Wit,</HI> or the pre∣serment of some most unlike to them, be taken for a testimony that the best men thrive worst, and the worst best, I hope it may be consider'd that those Violences proceeded from that which is most contrary to Popu∣larity, tho I am not very willing to explain it.</P>
<P>If these matters are not clear in themselves, I desire they may be com∣par'd with what has happen'd between any Princes that from the begin∣ning of the world have bin join'd in League to each other, whether they were of the same or of different Nations. Let an example be brought of six, thirteen, or more Princes or Kings who enter'd into a League; and for the space of one or more Ages, did neither break it, nor quarrel upon the explication of it. Let the States of the <HI>Switzers, Grisons,</HI> or <HI>Hollanders,</HI> be compar'd with that of <HI>France,</HI> when it was sometimes divided between two, three, or four Brothers of <HI>Meroveus</HI> or <HI>Pepin</HI>'s Races; with the Heptarchy of <HI>England;</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Leon, Arra∣gon, Navarr, Castile</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> under which the Christians in <HI>Spain</HI> were divided; or those of <HI>Cordoua, Sevil, Malaga, Granada,</HI> and others under the Power of the <HI>Moors:</HI> and if it be not evident, that the popu∣lar States have bin remarkable for Peace among themselves, constancy to their Union, and Fidelity to the Leagues made with their Associats; whereas all the abovemention'd Kingdoms, and such others as are known among men to have bin join'd in the like Leagues, were ever infested with domestick Rebellions and Quarrels arising from the Ambition of Princes,
<PB N="146" REF="154"/>
 so as no Confederacy could be so cautiously made, but they would find ways to elude it, or so solemn and sacred, but they would in far less time break thro it: I will confess, that Kingdoms have sometimes bin as free from civil disturbances; and that Leagues made between several Princes, have bin as constantly and religiously observ'd, as by Commonwealths. But if no such thing dos appear in the World, and no man who is not impudent or ignorant dare pretend it, I may justly conclude, that tho every Commonwealth has its Action sutable to its Constitution, and that many associated together are not so free from disturbances, as those that wholly depend upon the Authority of a Mother City; yet we know of none that have not bin, and are more regular and quiet than any Princi∣palitys; and as to Foreign Wars, they seek or avoid them according to their various Constitutions.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIII. That is the best Government, which best provides for War.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author having huddled up all popular and mix'd Governments into one, has in some measure forc'd me to explain the various Con∣stitutions and Principles upon which they are grounded: But as the wis∣dom of a Father is seen, not only in providing Bread for his Family, or increasing his Patrimonial Estate, but in making all possible provision for the security of it; so that Government is evidently the best, which, not relying upon what it dos at first enjoy, seeks to increase the number, strength, and riches of the People; and by the best Disciplin to bring the Power so improv'd into such order as may be of most use to the Pub∣lick. This comprehends all things conducing to the administration of Ju∣stice, the preservation of domestick Peace, and the increase of Com∣merce, that the People being pleas'd with their present condition, may be fill'd with love to their Country, encourag'd to fight boldly for the publick Cause, which is their own; and as men do willingly join with that which prospers, that Strangers may be invited to fix their Habita∣tions in such a City, and to espouse the principles that reign in it. This is necessary for several reasons; but I shall principally insist upon one, which is, that all things in their beginning are weak: The Whelp of a Lion newly born has neither strength nor fierceness. He that builds a Ci∣ty, and dos not intend it should increase, commits as great an absurdity, as if he should desire his Child might ever continue under the same weak∣ness in which he is born. If it dos not grow, it must pine and perish; for in this World nothing is permanent: that which dos not grow better will grow worse. This increase also is useless, or perhaps hurtful, if it be not in Strength, as well as in Riches or Number; for every one is apt to seize upon ill-guarded Treasures: and the terror that the City of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> was possest with, when a few Dutch Ships came to <HI>Chatham,</HI> shews that no numbers of men, tho naturally valiant, are able to defend them∣selves, unless they be well arm'd, disciplin'd and conducted. Their Mul∣titude brings confusion: their Wealth, when 'tis like to be made a prey, increases the fears of the owners; and they, who if they were brought into good order, might conquer a great part of the World, being desti∣tute of it, durst not think of defending themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="155"/>
If it be said that the wise Father mention'd by me endeavours to secure his Patrimony by Law, not by Force; I answer, that all defence termi∣nates in force; and if a private man dos not prepare to defend his Estate with his own Force, 'tis because he lives under the protection of the Law, and expects the force of the Magistrate should be a security to him: but Kingdoms and Commonwealths acknowledging no Superior, except God alone, can reasonably hope to be protected by him only; and by him, if with industry and courage they make use of the means he has given them for their own defence. God helps those who help themselves; and men are by several reasons (suppose to prevent the increase of a suspected Power) induc'd to succour an industrious and brave People: But such as neglect the means of their own preservation, are ever left to perish with shame. Men cannot rely upon any League: The State that is defended by one Potentat against another, becomes a Slave to their Pro∣tector: Mercenary Soldiers always want Fidelity or Courage, and most commonly both. If they are not corrupted or beaten by the Invader, they make a prey of their Masters. These are the followers of Camps who have neither Faith nor Piety <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">—Ibi fas ubi maxima merces. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></NOTE>but prefer Gain before Right. They who expose their Blood to sale, look where they can make the best bargain, and never fail of pretences for following their interests.</P>
<P>Moreover, private Familys may by several arts increase their Wealth, as they increase in number; but when a People multiplies (as they will always do in a good Climat under a good Government) such an enlarge∣ment of Territory as is necessary for their subsistence can be acquir'd only by War. This was known to the Northern Nations that invaded the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; but for want of such Constitutions as might best im∣prove their Strength and Valor, the numbers they sent out when they were overburden'd, provided well for themselves, but were of no use to the Countrys they left; and whilst those <HI>Goths, Vandals, Franks,</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> enjoy'd the most opulent and delicious Provinces of the World, their Fathers languish'd obscurely in their frozen Climats. For the like reasons, or thro the same defect, the <HI>Switzers</HI> are oblig'd to serve other Princes, and often to imploy that valor in advancing the power of their Neighbors, which might be us'd to increase their own. <HI>Genoua, Lucca, Geneva,</HI> and other small Commonwealths, having no Wars, are not able to nourish the men they breed; but sending many of their Children to seek their Fortunes abroad, scarce a third part of those that are born a∣mong them, die in those Citys; and if they did not take this course, they would have no better than the Nations inhabiting near the River <HI>Niger,</HI> who sell their Children as the increase of their Flocks.</P>
<P>This dos not less concern Monarchys than Commonwealths; nor the absolute less than the mix'd: All of them have bin prosperous or misera∣ble, glorious or contemptible, as they were better or worse arm'd, disci∣plin'd, or conducted. The <HI>Assyrian</HI> Valor was irresistible under <HI>Nabu∣chodonozor;</HI> but was brought to nothing under his base and luxurious Grandson <HI>Belshazzar:</HI> The <HI>Persians</HI> who under <HI>Cyrus</HI> conquer'd <HI>Asia,</HI> were like Swine expos'd to slaughter when their Disciplin fail'd, and they were commanded by his proud, cruel, and cowardly Successors. The <HI>Mace∣donian</HI> Army overthrown by <HI>Paulus Emilius</HI> was not less in number than that with which <HI>Alexander</HI> gain'd the Empire of the East; and perhaps had not bin inferior in Valor, if it had bin as well commanded. Many poor and almost unknown Nations have bin carry'd to such a height of
<PB N="148" REF="156"/>
 Glory by the Bravery of their Princes, that I might incline to think their Government as fit as any other for disciplining a People to War, if their Vertues continu'd in their Familys, or could be transmitted to their Suc∣cessors. The impossibility of this is a breach never to be repair'd; and no account is to be made of the good that is always uncertain, and seldom enjoy'd. This disease is not only in absolute Monarchys, but in those also where any regard is had to Succession of Blood, tho under the strictest limitations. The Fruit of all the Victorys gain'd by <HI>Edward</HI> the First and Third, or <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth of <HI>England,</HI> perish'd by the baseness of their Successors: the glory of our Arms was turn'd into shame; and we, by the loss of Treasure, Blood, and Territory, suffer'd the punish∣ment of their Vices. The effects of these changes are not always equally violent; but they are frequent, and must fall out as often as occasion is presented. It was not possible for <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth of <HI>France</HI> to pur∣sue the great designs of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth: <HI>Christina</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> could not supply the place of her brave Father; nor the present King in his In∣fancy accomplish what the great <HI>Charles Gustavus</HI> had nobly undertaken: and no remedy can be found for this mortal infirmity, unless the power be put into the hands of those who are able to execute it, and not left to the blindness of fortune. When the Regal Power is committed to an an∣nual or otherwise chosen Magistracy, the Vertues of excellent men are of use, but all dos not depend upon their persons: One man finishes what a∣nother had begun; and when many are by practice render'd able to per∣form the same things, the loss of one is easily supply'd by the election of another. When good Principles are planted, they do not die with the person that introduc'd 'em; and good Constitutions remain, tho the Au∣thors of 'em perish. <HI>Rome</HI> did not fall back into slavery when <HI>Brutus</HI> was kill'd, who had led them to recover their Liberty: Others like to him pursu'd the same ends; and notwithstanding the loss of so many great Commanders consum'd in their almost continual Wars, they never wanted such as were fit to execute whatever they could design. A well∣govern'd State is as fruitful to all good purposes, as the seven-headed Ser∣pent is said to have bin in evil; when one head is cut off, many rise up in the place of it. Good Order being once establish'd, makes good men; and as long as it lasts, such as are fit for the greatest imployments will never be wanting. By this means the <HI>Romans</HI> could not be surpris'd: No King or Captain ever invaded them, who did not find many excellent Com∣manders to oppose him; whereas they themselves found it easy to over∣throw Kingdoms, tho they had bin establish'd by the bravest Princes, thro the baseness of their Successors.</P>
<P>But if our Author says true, 'tis of no advantage to a popular State to have excellent men; and therefore he imposes <HI>a necessity upon every People to chuse the worst men for being the worst, and most like to themselves; lest that if vertuous and good men should come into power, they should be ex∣cluded for being vicious and wicked,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Wise men would seize upon the State, and take it from the People.</HI> For the understanding of these words, 'tis good to consider whether they are to be taken simply, as usually ap∣ply'd to the Devil and some of his instruments, or relatively, as to the thing in question: If simply, it must be concluded that <HI>Valerius, Brutus, Cincinnatus, Capitolinus, Mamercus, Paulus Emilius, Nasica,</HI> and others like to 'em, were not only the worst men of the City; but that they were so often advanc'd to the supreme Magistracy because they were so: if in the other sense relating to Magistracy, and the command of
<PB N="149" REF="157"/>
Armys, the worst are the most ignorant, unfaithful, slothful, or coward∣ly; and our Author, to make good his proposition, must prove, that when the People of <HI>Rome, Carthage, Athens,</HI> and other States had the power of chusing whom they pleas'd, they chose <HI>Camillus, Corvinus. Tor∣quatus, Fabius, Rullus, Scipio, Amilcar, Hannibal, Asdrubal, Pelopidas, Epaminondas, Pericles, Aristides, Themistocles, Phocion, Alcibiades,</HI> and others like to them, for their Ignorance, Infidelity, Sloth, and Cowar∣dice; and on account of those Vices, most like to those who chose them. But if these were the worst, I desire to know what wit or eloquence can describe or comprehend the excellency of the best; or of the Disciplin that brings whole Nations to such perfection, that worse than these could not be found among them? And if they were not so, but such as all suc∣ceeding Ages have justly admir'd for their Wisdom, Vertue, Industry, and Valor, the impudence of so wicked and false an Assertion ought to be rejected with scorn and hatred.</P>
<P>But if all Governments, whether Monarchial or Popular, absolute or limited, deserve praise or blame as they are well or ill constituted for ma∣king War; and that the attainment of this end dos intirely depend upon the qualifications of the Commanders, and the Strength, Courage, Number, Affection, and temper of the People out of which the Ar∣mys are drawn; those Governments must necessarily be the best which take the best care that those Armys may be well commanded; and so provide for the good of the People, that they may daily increase in Num∣ber, Courage, and Strength, and be so satisfy'd with the present state of things, as to fear a change, and fight for the preservation or advancement of the publick Interest as of their own. We have already found that in Hereditary Monarchys no care at all is taken of the Commander: He is not chosen, but comes by chance; and dos not only frequently prove defective, but for the most part utterly uncapable of performing any part of his duty; whereas in Popular Governments excellent men are general∣ly chosen; and there are so many of them, that if one or more perish, others are ready to supply their places. And this Discourse having (if I mistake not) in the whole series shewn, that the advantages of popu∣lar Governments, in relation to the increase of Courage, Number, and Strength in a People, out of which Armys are to be form'd, and bringing them to such a temper as prepares 'em bravely to perform their duty, are as much above those of Monarchys, as the prudence of Choice surpasses the accidents of Birth; it cannot be deny'd that in both respects the part which relates to War is much better perform'd in Popular Governments than in Monarchys.</P>
<P>That which we are by reason led to believe, is confirm'd to us by experi∣ence. We every where see the difference between the Courage of men fighting for themselves and their posterity, and those that serve a Master who by good success is often render'd insupportable. This is of such effi∣cacy, that no King could ever boast to have overthrown any considerable Commonwealth, unless it were divided within it self, or weaken'd by Wars made with such as were also free; which was the case of the <HI>Greci∣an</HI> Commonwealths when the <HI>Macedonians</HI> fell in upon them. Whereas the greatest Kingdoms have bin easily destroy'd by Commonwealths; and these also have lost all Strength, Valor and Spirit, after the change of their Government. The Power and Vertue of the <HI>Italians</HI> grew up, de∣cay'd and perish'd with their Liberty. When they were divided into many Commonwealths, every one of them was able to send out great
<PB N="150" REF="158"/>
 Armys, and to suffer many Defeats before they were subdu'd; so that their Citys were deliver'd up by the old Men, Women, and Children, when all those who were able to bear arms had bin slain: And when they were all brought under the <HI>Romans,</HI> either as Associats or Subjects, they made the greatest Strength that ever was in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Epirus</HI> was in Valor thought equal, and in Power little inferior to <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Macedon:</HI> but having the fortune to attack those who had bin brought up in Liberty, taught to hazard or suffer all things for it, and to think that God has given to men Hands and Swords only to defend it, he perish'd in his attempt; whilst the other encountring slavish Nations, under the conduct of proud, cruel and for the most part unwarlike Tyrants, became Master of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pyrrhus</HI> seems to have bin equal to either of them; but the Victo∣rys he obtain'd by an admirable Valor and Conduct, cost him so dear, that he desir'd Peace with those Enemys who might be defeated, not sub∣du'd.</P>
<P><HI>Hannibal</HI> wanting the prudence of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> lost the fruits of all his Victorys; and being torn out of <HI>Italy,</HI> where he had nested himself, fell under the Sword of those whose Fathers he had defeated or slain; and dy'd a banish'd man from his ruin'd Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gauls</HI> did once bring <HI>Rome,</HI> when it was small, to the brink of Destruction; but they left their Carcases to pay for the mischiefs they had done; and in succeeding times their Invasions were mention'd as Tumults rather than Wars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> did perhaps surpass them in numbers and strength, and were equal to them in fortune as long as <HI>Rome</HI> was free. They often enter'd <HI>Italy,</HI> but they continu'd not long there, unless under the weight of their Chains. Whereas the same Nations, and others like to them, assaulting that Country, or other Provinces under the Emperors, found no other difficulty than what arose upon contests among themselves who should be Master of them. No manly Vertue or Disciplin remain'd among the <HI>Italians:</HI> Those who govern'd them, rely'd upon tricks and shifts; they who could not defend themselves, hir'd some of those Nations to under∣take their Quarrels against others. These trinklings could not last. The <HI>Goths</HI> scorning to depend upon those who in Valor and Strength were much inferior to themselves, seiz'd upon the City that had commanded the World, whilst <HI>Honorius</HI> was so busy in providing for his Hens, that he could not think of defending it. <HI>Arcadius</HI> had the luck not to lose his prin∣cipal City; but passing his time among Fidlers, Players, Eunuchs, Cooks, Dancers, and Buffoons, the Provinces were securely plunder'd and ransack'd by Nations, that are known only from their Victorys a∣gainst him.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to say that this proceeded from the fatal corruption of that Age; for that corruption proceeded from the Government, and the en∣suing desolation was the effect of it. And as the like disorder in Govern∣ment has bin ever since in <HI>Greece</HI> and the greatest part of <HI>Italy,</HI> those Coun∣trys which for Extent, Riches, convenience of Situation, and numbers of men, are equal to the best in the world, and for the Wit, Courage, and Industry of the Natives, perhaps justly preferable to any, have since that time bin always expos'd as a prey to the first Invader. <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth of <HI>France</HI> is by <HI>Guicciardin,</HI> and other Writers, represented as a Prince equal∣ly weak in Body, Mind, Mony, and Forces; but as an ill Hare is said to make a good Dog, he conquer'd the best part of <HI>Italy</HI> without breaking
<PB N="151" REF="159"/>
a Lance. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Alphonso</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> Kings of <HI>Naples,</HI> had go∣vern'd by Trepanners, false Witnesses, corrupt Judges, mercenary Sol∣diers, and other Ministers of Iniquity: but these could afford no help a∣gainst an Invader; and neither the opprest Nobility, nor People, concern∣ing themselves in the quarrel, they who had bin proud, fierce, and cruel against their poor Subjects, never durst look an Enemy in the face; and the Father dying with anguish and fear, the Son shamefully fled from his ill-govern'd Kingdom.</P>
<P>The same things are no less evident in <HI>Spain.</HI> No People ever defended themselves with more Obstinacy and Valor than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did against the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> who surpast them in Wealth and Skill. <HI>Livy</HI> calls them <HI>Gentem ad bella gerenda &amp; reparanda natam,</HI> and who ge∣nerally kill'd themselves when they were master'd and disarm'd, <HI>Nullam sine armis vitam esse rati.</HI> But tho the mixture of <HI>Roman</HI> Blood could not impair their Race, and the conjunction of the <HI>Goths</HI> had improv'd their Force; yet no more was requir'd for the overthrow of them all, than the weakness and baseness of the two leud Tyrants, <HI>Witza</HI> and <HI>Rodrigo,</HI> who disdain'd all Laws, and resolv'd to govern according to their Lust. They who for more than two hundred years had resisted the <HI>Romans,</HI> were intirely subdu'd by the vile, half-naked <HI>Moors,</HI> in one slight Skirmish; and do not to this day know what became of the King who brought the De∣struction upon them. That Kingdom after many Revolutions, is with many others come to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and enjoys all the Wealth of the <HI>Indys;</HI> whereupon they are thought to have affected an universal Mo∣narchy. <HI>Sed ut sunt levia Aulicorum ingenia,</HI> this was grounded upon nothing except their own Vanity: They had Mony and Craft; but wanting that solid Vertue and Strength which makes and preserves Con∣quests, their Kings have nothing but <HI>Milan</HI> that did not come to them by Marriage: And tho they have not receiv'd any extraordinary disasters in War, yet they languish and consume thro the defects of their own Go∣vernment, and are forc'd to beg assistance from their mortal and formerly despis'd Enemys. These are the best hopes of defence that they have from abroad; and the only Enemy an Invader ought to fear in their de∣solate Territorys, is that Want and Famin which testifys the good Order, Strength and Stability of our Author's divine Monarchy; the profound Wisdom of their Kings in subtilly finding out so sure a way of defending the Country; their paternal care in providing for the good of their Sub∣jects; and that whatsoever is defective in the Prince, is assuredly supply'd by the Sedulity of a good Council.</P>
<P>We have already said enough to obviate the objections that may be drawn from the prosperity of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy. The beauty of it is false and painted. There is a rich and haughty King, who is blest with such Neighbours as are not likely to disturb him, and has nothing to fear from his miserable Subjects; but the whole body of that State is full of boils, and wounds, and putrid sores: There is no real strength in it. The People are so unwilling to serve him, that he is said to have put to death above four score thousand of his own Soldiers within the space of fifteen years, for flying from their Colours; and if he were vigorously attack'd, little help could be expected from a discontented Nobility, or a starving and despairing People. If to diminish the force of these arguments and examples, it be said, that in two or three thousand years all things are chang'd; the antient Vertue of Mankind is extinguish'd; and the love that every one had to his Country is turn'd into a care of his private In∣terests:
<PB N="152" REF="160"/>
 I answer, that Time changes nothing, and the Changes produc'd in this time proceed only from the change of Governments. The Na∣tions which have bin govern'd arbitrarily, have always suffer'd the same Plagues, and bin infected with the same Vices; which is as natural, as for Animals ever to generate according to their kinds, and Fruits to be of the same nature with the Roots and Seeds from which they come. The same Order that made men valiant and industrious in the service of their Country during the first Ages, would have the same effect, if it were now in being. Men would have the same love to the Publick as the <HI>Spar∣tans</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> had, if there was the same reason for it. We need no other proof of this than what we have seen in our own Country, where in a few years, good Disciplin and a just Encouragement given to those who did well, produc'd more examples of pure, compleat, incorruptible, and invincible Vertue than <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Greece</HI> could ever boast; or if more be wanting, they may easily be found among the <HI>Switzers, Hollanders,</HI> and others: but 'tis not necessary to light a Candle to the Sun.</P>

<DIV3 N="24" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXIV. Popular Governments are less subject to Civil Disorders than Monar∣chys; manage them more ably, and more easily recover out of them.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS in vain to seek a Government in all points free from a possibility of Civil Wars, Tumults, and Seditions: that is a Blessing de∣ny'd to this life, and reserv'd to compleat the Felicity of the next. But if these are to be accounted the greatest evils that can fall upon a People, the rectitude or defects of Governments will best appear if we examin which <HI>Species</HI> is more or less expos'd to, or exempted from them.</P>
<P>This may be done two ways.</P>
<P>1. By searching into the causes from whence they may, or usually do arise.</P>
<P>2. Which kind has actually bin most frequently and dangerously di∣sturb'd by them.</P>
<P>To the first: Seditions, Tumults, and Wars do arise from mistake, or from malice; from just occasions, or unjust. From mistake, when a Peo∣ple think an evil to be done or intended, which is not done nor intended; or take that to be evil which is done, tho in truth it be not so. Well re∣gulated Citys may fall into these errors. The <HI>Romans</HI> being jealous of their newly recover'd Liberty, thought that <HI>Valerius Publicola</HI> design'd to make himself King, when he built a House in a place that seem'd too strong and eminent for a private man. The <HI>Spartans</HI> were not less sus∣picious of <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> and a leud young Fellow in a Sedition put out one of his eyes: but no People ever continu'd in a more constant af∣fection to their best deserving Citizens, than both the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Spartans</HI> afterwards manifested to those vertuous and wrongfully suspect∣ed men.</P>
<P>Sometimes the fact is true, but otherwise understood than was intend∣ed. When the <HI>Tarquins</HI> were expel'd from <HI>Rome,</HI> the Patricians retain'd to themselves the principal Magistracys; but never thought of bringing back Kings, or of setting up a corrupt Oligarchy among themselves, as the Plebeians imagin'd: And this mistake being discover'd, the fury they
<PB N="153" REF="161"/>
had conceiv'd, vanish'd; and they who seem'd to intend nothing less than the extirpation of all the Patrician Familys, grew quiet. <HI>Menenius Agrippa</HI> appeas'd one of the most violent Seditions that ever happen'd a∣mongst them (till civil Interests were pursu'd by arm'd Troops) with a Fable of the several parts of the Body that murmur'd against the Belly: and the most dangerous of all was compos'd by creating Tribuns to protect them. Some of the Patrician young men had favour'd the <HI>De∣cemviri,</HI> and others being unwilling to appear against them, the People believ'd they had all conspir'd with those new Tyrants: but <HI>Valerius</HI> and <HI>Horatius</HI> putting themselves at the head of those who sought their de∣struction, they perceiv'd their Error, and look'd upon the <HI>Patricians</HI> as the best defenders of their Libertys: <HI>Et inde,</HI> says <HI>Livy, auram Libertatis captare, unde servitutem timuissent.</HI> Democratical Governments are most liable to these mistakes: In Aristocracys they are seldom seen, and we hear of none in <HI>Sparta</HI> after the establishment of the Laws by <HI>Lycurgus.</HI> But Absolute Monarchys seem to be totally exempted from them. The mischiefs design'd are often dissembled or deny'd, till they are past all pos∣sibility of being cur'd by any other way than force: and such as are by necessity driven to use that remedy, know they must perfect their work or perish. He that draws his Sword against the Prince, say the <HI>French,</HI> ought to throw away the Scabbard; for tho the design be never so just, yet the Authors are sure to be ruin'd if it miscarry. Peace is seldom made, and never kept, unless the Subject retain such a Power in his hands, as may oblige the Prince to stand to what is agreed; and in time some trick is found to deprive them of that benefit.</P>
<P>Seditions proceeding from malice, are seldom or never seen in popular Governments; for they are hurtful to the People, and none have ever willingly and knowingly hurt themselves. There may be, and often is malice in those who excite them; but the People are ever deceiv'd, and whatsoever is thereupon done, ought to be imputed to error, as I said be∣fore. If this be discover'd in time, it usually turns to the destruction of the Contriver; as in the cases of <HI>Manlius Capitolinus, Spurius Melius,</HI> and <HI>Sp. Cassius:</HI> if not, for the most part it produces a Tyranny, as in those of <HI>Agathocles, Dionysius, Pisistrates,</HI> and <HI>Cesar.</HI> But in Absolute Monarchys, almost all the Troubles that arise, proceed from malice; they cannot be reform'd, the extinction of them is exceeding difficult, if they have continu'd long enough to corrupt the People; and those who appear against 'em, seek only to set up themselves, or their Friends. Thus we see that in the Civil Wars of the East, the question was, Whe∣ther <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> or <HI>Cyrus, Phraartes</HI> or <HI>Bardanes,</HI> should reign over the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Parthians:</HI> The People suffer'd equally from both whilst the Contests lasted; and the decision left 'em under the power of a proud and cruel Master. The like is seen in all places. After the death of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius,</HI> no War was ever undertaken in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire upon a better account than one man's private concernments: The Provinces suffer'd un∣der all; and he, whom they had assisted to overthrow one wicked Tyrant, very often prov'd worse than his Predecessor. And the only ground of all the Dissensions with which <HI>France</HI> was vex'd under the Princes of <HI>Me∣roveus</HI> and <HI>Pepin</HI>'s Races, were, which of them should reign, the People remaining miserable under them all.</P>
<P>The case is not much different in mix'd Monarchys: Some Wars may be undertaken upon a just and publick account, but the pretences are com∣monly false: a lasting Reformation is hardly introduc'd, an intire Change
<PB N="154" REF="162"/>
 often dislik'd. And tho such Kingdoms are frequently and terribly di∣stracted, as appears by the beforemention'd Examples of <HI>England, Spain,</HI> &amp;c. the Quarrels are for the most part begun upon personal Titles, as be∣tween <HI>Henry</HI> the First and <HI>Robert; Stephen</HI> and <HI>Maud;</HI> or the Houses of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>York:</HI> and the People who get nothing by the Victory which way soever it fall, and might therefore prudently leave the Com∣petitors to decide their own Quarrels, like <HI>Theorestes</HI> and <HI>Polinices,</HI> with their own Swords, become cruelly engag'd in them.</P>
<P>It may seem strange to some that I mention Seditions, Tumults, and Wars, upon just occasions; but I can find no reason to retract the term. God intending that men should live justly with one another, dos certainly intend that he or they who do no wrong, should suffer none; and the Law that forbids Injurys, were of no use, if no Penalty might be in∣flicted on those who will not obey it. If Injustice therefore be evil, and Injurys forbidden, they are also to be punish'd; and the Law instituted for their prevention, must necessarily intend the avenging of such as can∣not be prevented. The work of the Magistracy is to execute this Law; the Sword of Justice is put into their hands to restrain the fury of those within the Society who will not be a Law to themselves; and the Sword of War to protect the people against the violence of Foreigners. This is without exception, and would be in vain if it were not. But the Magi∣strate who is to protect the People from Injury, may, and is often known not to have done it: he sometimes renders his Office useless by neglecting to do Justice; sometimes mischievous by overthrowing it. This strikes at the root of God's general Ordinance, That there should be Laws; and the particular Ordinances of all Societys, that appoint such as seem best to them. The Magistrate therefore is comprehended under both, and sub∣ject to both, as well as private men.</P>
<P>The ways of preventing or punishing Injurys, are Judicial or Extraju∣dicial. Judicial proceedings are of force against those who submit or may be brought to trial, but are of no effect against those who resist, and are of such power that they cannot be constrain'd. It were absurd to cite a man to appear before a Tribunal who can aw the Judges, or has Armys to de∣fend him; and impious to think that he who has added Treachery to his other Crimes, and usurp'd a Power above the Law, should be protected by the enormity of his wickedness. Legal proceedings therefore are to be us'd when the Delinquent submits to the Law; and all are just, when he will not be kept in order by the legal.</P>
<P>The word Sedition is generally apply'd to all numerous Assemblys, without or against the Authority of the Magistrate, or of those who as∣sume that Power. <HI>Athaliah</HI> and <HI>Jezabel</HI> were more ready to cry out Trea∣son than <HI>David;</HI> and examples of that sort are so frequent, that I need not alledg them.</P>
<P>Tumult is from the disorderly manner of those Assemblys, where things can seldom be done regularly; and War is that <HI>Decertatio per vim,</HI> or trial by force, to which men come when other ways are inef∣fectual.</P>
<P>If the Laws of God and Men are therefore of no effect, when the Magistracy is left at liberty to break them; and if the Lusts of those who are too strong for the Tribunals of Justice, cannot be otherwise restrain'd than by Sedition, Tumults and War, those Seditions, Tumults, and Wars, are justify'd by the Laws of God and Man.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="163"/>
I will not take upon me to enumerate all the cases in which this may be done, but content my self with three, which have most frequently given occasion for proceedings of this kind.</P>
<P>The first is, When one or more men take upon them the Power and Name of a Magistracy, to which they are not justly call'd.</P>
<P>The second, When one or more being justly call'd, continue in their Magistracy longer than the Laws by which they are call'd do prescribe.</P>
<P>And the third, When he or they who are rightly call'd, do assume a Power, tho within the time prescrib'd, that the Law dos not give; or turn that which the Law dos give, to an end different and contrary to that which is intended by it.</P>
<P>For the first; <HI>Filmer</HI> forbids us to examin Titles: he tells us, we must submit to the Power, whether acquir'd by Usurpation or otherwise, not observing the mischievous Absurdity of rewarding the most detestable Villanys with the highest Honors, and rendering the veneration due to the supreme Magistrate as Father of the People, to one who has no other ad∣vantage above his Brethren, than what he has gain'd by injuriously dis∣possessing or murdering him that was so. <HI>Hobbs</HI> fearing the advantages that may be taken from such desperate nonsense, or not thinking it neces∣sary to his end to carry the matter so far, has no regard at all to him who comes in without Title or Consent; and denying him to be either King or Tyrant, gives him no other name than <HI>Hostis &amp; Latro,</HI> and allows all things to be lawful against him, that may be done to a publick Enemy or Pyrat: which is as much as to say, any man may destroy him how he can. Whatever he may be guilty of in other respects, he dos in this fol∣low the voice of Mankind, and the dictates of common sense: for no man can make himself a Magistrate for himself, and no man can have the <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Civ. l. 2.</NOTE>right of a Magistrate, who is not a Magistrate. If he be justly account∣ed an Enemy to all, who injures all; he above all must be the publick Enemy of a Nation, who by usurping a power over them, dos the greatest and most publick injury that a People can suffer: For which rea∣son, by an establish'd Law among the most vertuous Nations, every man might kill a Tyrant; and no Names are recorded in History with more honor, than of those who did it.</P>
<P>These are by other Authors call'd <HI>Tyranni sine titulo,</HI> and that name is given to all those who obtain the supreme Power by illegal and unjust means. The Laws which they overthrow can give them no protection; and every man is a Soldier against him who is a publick E∣nemy.</P>
<P>The same rule holds, tho they are more in number; as the <HI>Magi,</HI> who usurp'd the Dominion of <HI>Persia</HI> after the death of <HI>Cambyses;</HI> the thirty Tyrants at <HI>Athens</HI> overthrown by <HI>Thrasibulus;</HI> those of <HI>Thebes</HI> slain by <HI>Pelopidas;</HI> the <HI>Decemviri</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and others: For tho the multitude of Offenders may sometimes procure impunity, yet that act which is wicked in one, must be so in ten or twenty; and whatsoever is lawful against one Usurper, is so against them all.</P>
<P>2. If those who were rightly created, continue beyond the time li∣mited by the Law, 'tis the same thing. That which is expir'd, is as if it had never bin. He that was created Consul for a year, or Dictator for six months, was after that a private man; and if he had continu'd in the exercise of his Magistracy, had bin subject to the same punishment as if he had usurp'd it at the first. This was known to <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> who finding that his Enterprize against <HI>Sparta</HI> could not be accomplish'd
<PB N="156" REF="164"/>
 within the time for which he was made <HI>Boeotarches,</HI> rather chose to trust his Countrymen with his life than to desist, and was sav'd merely thro an admiration of his Vertue, assurance of his good Intentions, and the glory of the Action.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Decemviri,</HI> tho duly elected, were proceeded against as private men usurping the Magistracy, when they continu'd beyond their time. Other Magistrats had ceas'd; there was none that could regularly call the Senat or People to an Assembly: but when their ambition was manifest, and the People exasperated by the death of <HI>Virginia,</HI> they laid aside all ceremonys. The Senat and People met, and exercising their Authority in the same manner as if they had bin regularly call'd by the Magistrate appointed to that end, they abrogated the Power of the <HI>De∣cemviri,</HI> proceeded against them as Enemys and Tyrants, and by that means preserv'd themselves from utter ruin.</P>
<P>3. The same course is justly us'd against a legal Magistrate, who takes upon him (tho within the time prescrib'd by the Law) to exercise a Power which the Law dos not give; for in that respect he is a private man, <HI>Quia,</HI> as <HI>Grotius</HI> says, <HI>eatenus non habet imperium;</HI> and may be re∣strain'd as well as any other, because he is not set up to do what he lists, but what the Law appoints for the good of the People: and as he has no other Power than what the Law allows, so the same Law limits and di∣rects the exercise of that which he has. This Right naturally belonging to Nations, is no way impair'd by the name of <HI>Supreme</HI> given to their Magistrats; for it signifys no more, than that they do act sovereignly in the matters committed to their charge. Thus are the Parliaments of <HI>France</HI> call'd <HI>Cours Souveraines;</HI> for they judg of Life and Death, deter∣min Controversys concerning Estates; and there is no appeal from their Decrees: but no man ever thought, that it was therefore lawful for them to do what they pleas'd; or that they might not be oppos'd, if they should attempt to do that which they ought not. And tho the <HI>Roman</HI> Dicta∣tors and Consuls were supreme Magistrats, they were subject to the Peo∣ple, and might be punish'd as well as others if they transgrest the Law. <HI>Thuanus</HI> carrys the word so far, that when <HI>Barlotta, Giustiniano,</HI> and others who were but Colonels, were sent as Commanders in chief of three or four thousand men upon an Enterprize, he always says, <HI>Sum∣mum Imperium ei delatum. Grotius</HI> explains this point, by distinguishing those who have the <HI>summum Imperium summo modo,</HI> from those who have it <HI>modo non summo.</HI> I know not where to find an Example of this Sove∣reign Power, enjoy'd without restriction, under a better title than <HI>Occu∣pation;</HI> which relates not to our purpose, who seek only that which is legal and just. Therefore laying aside that point for the present, we may <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jur. Bell. &amp; Pac. l. 2.</NOTE>follow <HI>Grotius</HI> in examining the right of those who are certainly limited: <HI>Ʋbi partem Imperii habet Rex, partem Senatus sive Populus;</HI> in which case he says, <HI>Regi in partem non suam involanti, vis justa opponi potest,</HI> in as much as they who have a part, cannot but have a right of defend∣ing that part. <HI>Quia data facultate, datur jus facultatem tuendi,</HI> without which it could be of no effect.</P>
<P>The particular limits of the Rights belonging to each, can only be judg'd by the precise Letter, or general Intention of the Law. The Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> have certainly a part in the Government, and could not be call'd Magistrats if they had not. They are said to be <HI>supreme;</HI> all Laws and publick Acts bear their Names. The Embassador of that State speaking <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an. l. 137.</NOTE>to Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the Fifth, deny'd that he acknowledg'd any other Superior
<PB N="157" REF="165"/>
than God. But they are so well known to be under the Power of the Law, that divers of 'em have bin put to death for transgressing it; and a marble Gallows is seen at the foot of the stairs in St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Palace, upon which some of them, and no others, have bin executed. But if they may be duly oppos'd, when they commit undue Acts, no man of judg∣ment will deny, that if one of them by an outrageous Violence should endeavour to overthrow the Law, he might by violence be supprest and chastis'd.</P>
<P>Again, some Magistrats are intrusted with a power of providing Ships, Arms, Ammunition, and Victuals for War; raising and disciplining Soldiers, appointing Officers to command in Forts and Garisons, and making Leagues with Foreign Princes and States. But if one of these should imbezel, sell, or give to an Enemy those Ships, Arms, Ammuni∣tion or Provisions; betray the Forts; employ only or principally, such men as will serve him in those wicked Actions; and, contrary to the trust repos'd in him, make such Leagues with Foreigners, as tend to the advancement of his personal Interests, and to the detriment of the Pub∣lick, he abrogates his own Magistracy; and the Right he had, perishes (as the Lawyers say) <HI>frustratione finis.</HI> He cannot be protected by the Law which he has overthrown, nor obtain impunity for his Crimes from the Authority that was confer'd upon him, only that he might do good with it. He was <HI>singulis major</HI> on account of the excellency of his Office; but <HI>universis minor,</HI> from the nature and end of his Institution. The surest way of extinguishing his Prerogative, was by turning it to the hurt of those who gave it. When matters are brought to this po∣sture, the Author of the mischief, or the Nation must perish. A Flock cannot subsist under a Shepherd that seeks its ruin, nor a People under an unfaithful Magistrate. Honor and Riches are justly heap'd upon the heads of those who rightly perform their duty, because the difficulty as well as the excellency of the work is great. It requires Courage, Expe∣rience, Industry, Fidelity and Wisdom. <HI>The good Shepherd,</HI> says our Saviour, <HI>lays down his life for his Sheep:</HI> The Hireling who flies in time of danger, is represented under an ill character; but he that sets himself to destroy his Flock, is a Wolf. His Authority is incompatible with their subsistence; and whoever disapproves Tumults, Seditions or War, by which he may be remov'd from it, if gentler means are ineffectual, sub∣verts the Foundation of all Law, exalts the fury of one man to the de∣struction of a Nation; and giving an irresistible Power to the most abo∣minable Iniquity, exposes all that are good to be destroy'd, and Vertue to be utterly extinguish'd.</P>
<P>Few will allow such a Preeminence to the Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> or <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Advoyers of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> or the Burgomasters of <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> Ma∣ny will say these are Rascals if they prove false, and ought rather to be hang'd, than suffer'd to accomplish the Villanys they design. But if this be confest in relation to the highest Magistrats that are among those Na∣tions, why should not the same be in all others, by what name soever they are call'd? When did God confer upon those Nations the extraor∣dinary privilege of providing better for their own safety than others? Or was the Gift universal, tho the Benefit accrue only to those who have banish'd great Titles from among them? If this be so, 'tis not their Feli∣city, but their Wisdom that we ought to admire and imitate. But why should any think their Ancestors had not the same care? Have not they, who retain'd in themselves a Power over a Magistrate of one name, the
<PB N="158" REF="166"/>
 like over another? Is there a charm in words, or any name of such effi∣cacy, that he who receives it should immediately become Master of those that created him, whereas all others do remain for ever subject to them? Would the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government change its nature, if they should give the name of King to their Prince? Are the <HI>Polanders</HI> less sree since the title of King is confer'd upon their Dukes; or are the <HI>Moscovites</HI> less Slaves, be∣cause their chief Magistrate has no other than that of Duke? If we exa∣min things but a little, 'twill appear that Magistrats have enjoy'd large Powers, who never had the name of Kings; and none were ever more restrain'd by Laws than those of <HI>Sparta, Arragon,</HI> the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain, Hungary, Bohemia, Sweden, Denmark, Poland,</HI> and others, who had that Title. There is therefore no such thing as a Right universally belonging to a Name; but every one enjoys that which the Laws, by which he is, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er upon him. The Law that gives the Power, regulates it; and they who give no more than what they please, cannot be oblig'd to suffer him to whom they give it, to take more than they thought fit to give, or to go unpunish'd if he do. The Agreements made are always con∣firm'd by Oath, and the treachery of violating them is consequently ag∣gravated by Perjury. They are good Philosophers and able Divines, who think this can create a Right to those who had none; or that the Laws can be a protection to such as overthrow them, and give op∣portunity of doing the mischiefs they design. If it do not, then he that was a Magistrate, by such actions returns into the condition of a private man; and whatever is lawful against a Thief who submits to no Law, is lawful against him.</P>
<P>Men who delight in cavils may ask, Who shall be the Judg of these oc∣casions? And whether I intend to give to the People the decision of their own Cause? To which I answer, that when the contest is between the Ma∣gistrate and the People, the party to which the determination is refer'd, must be the Judg of his own case; and the question is only, Whether the Magistrate should depend on the Judgment of the People, or the Peo∣ple on that of the Magistrate; and which is most to be suspected of inju∣stice: That is, whether the People of <HI>Rome</HI> should judg <HI>Tarquin,</HI> or <HI>Tarquin</HI> judg the People. He that knew all good men abhor'd him for the murder of his Wife, Brother, Father-in-law, and the best of the Senat, would cer∣tainly strike off the heads of the most eminent remaining Poppys; and having incur'd the general hatred of the people by the wickedness of his Government, he fear'd revenge; and endeavouring to destroy those he fear'd (that is the City) he might easily have accomplish'd his work, if the judgment had bin refer'd to him. If the People judg <HI>Tarquin,</HI> 'tis hard to imagin how they should be brought to give an unjust Sentence: They lov'd their former Kings, and hated him only for his Villanys: They did not fancy, but know his cruelty. When the best were slain, no man that any way resembled them could think himself secure. <HI>Brutus</HI> did not pretend to be a Fool, till by the murder of his Brother he found how dangerous a thing it was to be thought wise. If the people, as our Author says, be always leud, foolish, mad, wicked, and desirous to put the Power into the hands of such as are most like to themselves, he and his Sons were such men as they sought, and he was sure to find favoura∣ble Judges: If vertuous and good, no injustice was to be fear'd from them, and he could have no other reason to decline their judgment, than what was suggested by his own wickedness. <HI>Caligula, Nero, Domitian,</HI> and the like, had probably the same considerations: But no man of com∣mon
<PB N="159" REF="167"/>
sense ever thought that the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> did not better deserve to judg, whether such Monsters should reign over the best part of mankind to their destruction, than they to determin whether their Crimes should be punish'd or not.</P>
<P>If I mention some of these known Cases, every man's experience will suggest others of the like nature; and whosoever condemns all Seditions, Tumults and Wars rais'd against such Princes, must say, that none are wicked, or seek the ruin of their People, which is absurd: for <HI>Caligula</HI> wish'd the People had but one Neck, that he might cut it off at a blow; <HI>Nero</HI> set the City on fire; and we have known such as have bin worse than either of them: They must either be suffer'd to continue in the free exercise of their rage, that is, to do all the mischief they design; or must be restrain'd by a legal, judicial, or extrajudicial way; and they who disallow the extrajudicial, do as little like the judicial. They will not hear of bringing a supreme Magistrate before a Tribunal, when it may be done. <HI>They will,</HI> says our Author, <HI>depose their Kings.</HI> Why should they not be depos'd, if they become Enemys to their People, and set up an interest in their own persons inconsistent with the publick good, for the promoting of which they were erected? If they were created by the publick consent, for the publick good, shall they not be remov'd when they prove to be of publick damage? If they set up themselves, may they not be thrown down? Shall it be lawful for them to usurp a Power over the liberty of others, and shall it not be lawful for an injur'd People to re∣sume their own? If injustice exalt it self, must it be for ever establish'd? Shall great Persons be render'd sacred by rapine, perjury and murder? Shall the crimes for which private men do justly suffer the most grievous punishments, exempt them from all, who commit them in the highest ex∣cess, with most power, and most to the prejudice of mankind? Shall the Laws that solely aim at the prevention of Crimes, be made to patronize them, and become snares to the innocent whom they ought to protect? Has every man given up into the common store his right of avenging the Injurys he may receive, that the publick Power which ought to protect or avenge him, should be turn'd to the destruction of himself, his Poste∣rity, and the Society into which they enter, without any possibility of redress? Shall the Ordinance of God be render'd of no effect; or the Powers he has appointed to be set up for the distribution of Justice, be made subservient to the lusts of one or a sew men, and by impunity in∣courage them to commit all manner of crimes? Is the corruption of man's Nature so little known, that such as have common sense should expect Justice from those, who sear no punishment if they do Injustice; or that the modesty, integrity, and innocence, which is seldom found in one man, tho never so cautiously chosen, should be constantly found in all those who by any means attain to Greatness, and continue for ever in their Successors; or that there can be any security under their Government, if they have them not? Surely if this were the condition of men living under Government, Forests would be more safe than Citys; and 'twere better for every man to stand in his own defence, than to enter into Societys. He that lives alone might encounter such as should assault him upon equal terms, and stand or fall according to the measure of his courage and strength; but no Valor can defend him, if the malice of his Enemy be upheld by a publick Power. There must therefore be a right of pro∣ceeding judicially or extrajudicially against all persons who transgress the Laws, or else those Laws, and the Societys that should subsist by them,
<PB N="160" REF="168"/>
 cannot stand; and the ends for which Governments are constituted, to∣gether with the Governments themselves, must be overthrown. Extraju∣dicial proceedings by Sedition, Tumult, or War, must take place, when the persons concern'd are of such power, that they cannot be brought un∣der the Judicial. They who deny this, deny all help against an usurp∣ing Tyrant, or the perfidiousness of a lawfully created Magistrate, who adds the crimes of Ingratitude and Treachery to Usurpation. These of all men are the most dangerous Enemys to supreme Magistrats: for as no man desires indemnity for such Crimes as are never committed, he that would exempt all from punishment, supposes they will be guilty of the worst; and by concluding that the People will depose them if they have the power, acknowledg that they pursue an Interest annex'd to their Per∣sons, contrary to that of their People, which they would not bear if they could deliver themselves from it. This shewing all those Governments to be tyrannical, lays such a burden upon those who administer them, as must necessarily weigh them down to destruction.</P>
<P>If it be said that the word Sedition implys that which is evil; I answer, that it ought not then to be apply'd to those who seek nothing but that which is just; and tho the ways of delivering an opprest People from the violence of a wicked Magistrate, who having arm'd a Crew of leud Villains, and fatted them with the Blood and Confiscations of such as were most ready to oppose him, be extraordinary, the inward righteous∣ness of the Act dos fully justify the Authors. He that has vertue and power to save a People, can never want a right of doing it. <HI>Valerius Asiaticus</HI> had no hand in the death of <HI>Caligula;</HI> but when the furious Guards began tumultuously to inquire who had kill'd him, he appeased them with <HI>wishing he had bin the man.</HI> No wise man ever ask'd by what authority <HI>Thrasibulus, Harmodius, Aristogiton, Pelopidas, Epaminondas, Dion, Timoleon, Lucius Brutus, Publicola, Horatius, Valerius, Marcus Brutus, C. Cassius,</HI> and the like, deliver'd their Countrys from Tyrants. Their Actions carry'd in them their own justification, and their Vertues will never be forgotten whilst the names of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> are remem∣ber'd in the World.</P>
<P>If this be not enough to declare the Justice inherent in, and the Glory that ought to accompany these Works, the examples of <HI>Moses, Aaron, Othniel, Ehud, Barac, Gideon, Samuel, Jephtha, David, Jehu, Jehoiada,</HI> the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> and other holy men rais'd up by God for the deliverance of his People from their Oppressors, decide the Question. They are perpetually renown'd for having led the People by extraordinary ways (which such as our Author express under the names of Sedition, Tumult, and War) to recover their Libertys, and avenge the injurys receiv'd from foreign or domestick Tyrants. The work of the Apostles was not in their time to set up or pull down any civil State; but they so behav'd themselves in relation to all the Powers of the Earth, that they gain'd the name of pestilent seditious Fellows, Disturbers of the People; and left it as an inheritance to those, who in succeeding Ages by following their steps should deserve to be call'd their Successors; whereby they were expos'd to the hatred of corrupt Magistrats, and brought under the necessity of pe∣rishing by them, or desending themselves against them: and he that de∣nys them that right, dos at once condemn the most glorious Actions of the wisest, best, and holiest men that have bin in the world, together with the Laws of God and Man, upon which they were founded.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="169"/>
Nevertheless, there is a sort of Sedition, Tumult, and War proceeding from Malice, which is always detestable, aiming only at the satisfaction of private Lust, without regard to the publick Good. This cannot hap∣pen in a Popular Government, unless it be amongst the Rabble; or when the Body of the People is so corrupted, that it cannot stand; but is most frequent in, and natural to absolute Monarchys. When <HI>Abimelech</HI> desir'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 9.</NOTE>to make himself King, he rais'd a Tumult among the basest of the Peo∣ple: He hir'd light and vain Persons, some Translations call them leud Vagabonds, kill'd his Brethren, but perish'd in his design; the corrupt party that favor'd him not having Strength enough to subdue the other, who were more sincere. <HI>Sp. Melius, Sp. Cassius,</HI> and <HI>Manlius</HI> attempted the like in <HI>Rome:</HI> they acted maliciously, their pretences to procure the publick Good were false. 'Tis probable that some in the City were as bad as they, and knew that mischief was intended; but the Body of the People not being corrupted, they were supprest. It appear'd, says <HI>Livy, Nihil esse minus populare quam regnum:</HI> they who had favor'd <HI>Manlius,</HI> condemn'd him to death when it was prov'd, that <HI>egregias alioqui virtutes foeda regni cupidine maculasset.</HI> But when the People is generally corrup∣ted, such designs seldom miscarry, and the success is always the erection of a Tyranny. Nothing else can please vain and profligate persons, and no Tyranny was ever set up by such as were better qualify'd. The ways of attaining it have always bin by corrupting the manners of the People, bribing Soldiers, entertaining mercenary Strangers, opening Prisons, giving Liberty to Slaves, alluring indigent persons with hopes of abolishing Debts, coming to a new division of Lands, and the like. Seditions rais'd by such men always tend to the ruin of popular Govern∣ments; but when they happen under absolute Monarchys, the hurt intended is only to the Person, who being remov'd, the Promoters of 'em set up another; and he that is set up, subsisting only by the strength of those who made him, is oblig'd to foment the Vices that drew them to serve him; tho another may perhaps make use of the same against him.</P>
<P>The consequence of this is, That those who uphold popular Govern∣ments, look upon Vice and Indigence as mischiefs that naturally increase each other, and equally tend to the ruin of the State. When men are by Vice brought into want, they are ready for mischief: there is no Villany that men of profligate Lives, lost Reputation, and desperate Fortunes will not undertake. Popular Equality is an enemy to these; and they who would preserve it, must preserve integrity of Manners, Sobriety, and an honest contentedness with what the Law allows. On the other side, the absolute Monarch, who will have no other Law than his own Will, desires to increase the number of those who thro leudness and beg∣gery may incline to depend upon him; tho the same temper of Mind, and condition of Fortune prepare them also for such Seditions as may bring him into danger; and the same corruption which led them to set him up, may invite them to sell him to another that will give them better wages.</P>
<P>I do not by this conclude that all Monarchs are vicious men; but that whoever will set up an absolute Power, must do it by these means; and that if such a Power be already establish'd, and should fall into the hands of a person, who by his Vertue and the gentleness of his Nature should endeavor to render the Yoke so easy, that a better disciplin'd People might be contented to bear it; yet this method could last no longer than
<PB N="162" REF="170"/>
 his life, and probably would be a means to shorten it; that which was at first establish'd by evil Arts always returning to the same: That which was vicious in the principle, can never be long upheld by Vertue; and we see that the worst of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors were not in greater dan∣ger from such good men as remain'd undestroy'd, than the best from the corrupt Party that would not be corrected, and sought such a Master as would lay no restriction upon their Vices. Those few who escap'd the rage of these Villains, only gave a little breathing time to the afflicted World, which by their Children or Successors was again plung'd into that extremity of misery, from which they intended to deliver it. An ex∣traordinary Vertue was requir'd to keep a Prince in a way contrary to the principles of his own Government; which being rarely found, and ne∣ver continuing long in a Family or Succession of men, the endeavors of the best became ineffectual, and either they themselves perish'd in them, or after their death all things return'd into the old polluted Chan∣nel.</P>
<P>Tho the Power of the Hebrew Kings was not unlimited, yet it ex∣ceeded the Rules set by God, and was sufficient to increase the number of the worst of men, and to give them opportunitys of raising perpetual disturbances. On the King's side there were Flatterers and Instruments of mischief: On the other side there were indebted and discontented Persons. Notwithstanding the Justice of <HI>David</HI>'s cause, the Wisdom, Valor, and Piety of his Person, none would follow him, except a few of his own Kindred (who knew what God had promis'd to him) and such as were uneasy in their worldly circumstances. After the death of <HI>Saul</HI> there was a long and bloody War between <HI>Ishbosheth</HI> and <HI>David.</HI> The former being kill'd, the slightest matters were sufficient to put the whole Nation into blood. <HI>Absalom</HI> with a few fair words was able to raise all <HI>Israel</HI> against his Father: <HI>Sheba</HI> the Son of <HI>Bichri</HI> with as much ease rais'd a more dangerous Tumult: <HI>David,</HI> by Wisdom, Valor, and the Blessing of God, surmounted these Difficultys, and prepar'd a peace∣able Reign for <HI>Solomon:</HI> but after his death they broke out into a Flame that was never quench'd, till the Nation was so dispers'd that no man knew where to find his Enemys. <HI>Solomon</HI> by his Magnificence had reduc'd <HI>Israel</HI> to such poverty, as inclin'd them to revolt upon the first offer of an opportunity by <HI>Jeroboam.</HI> From that time forward <HI>Israel</HI> was perpetually vex'd with Civil Seditions and Conspiracys, or Wars with their Brethren of <HI>Judah.</HI> Nine Kings with their Familys were destroy'd by the first, and the latter brought such Slaughters upon the miserable People, as were never suffer'd by any who were not agitated by the like Fury; and the course of these mischiefs was never interrupted, till they had brought the Nation into Captivity, and the Country to Desolation. Tho God ac∣cording to his promise did preserve a light in the House of <HI>David,</HI> yet the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> was not the more happy. <HI>Joash</HI> was slain by a pri∣vate Conspiracy, and <HI>Amaziah</HI> (as is most probable) by publick Autho∣rity, for having foolishly brought a terrible Slaughter upon <HI>Judah. A∣thaliah</HI> destroy'd the King's Race, and was kill'd her self by <HI>Jehoiada,</HI> who not having learn'd from our Author to regard the Power only, and not the ways by which it was obtain'd, caus'd her to be drag'd out of the Temple, and put to a well-deserv'd Death. The whole Story is a Tragedy: and if it be pretended that this proceeded rather from the wrath of God against his People for their Idolatry, than from such causes as are applicable to other Nations; I answer, that this Idolatry was the
<PB N="163" REF="171"/>
production of the Government they had set up, and most sutable to it; and chusing rather to subject themselves to the Will of a man than to the Law of God, they deservedly suffer'd the evils that naturally follow the worst Counsels. We know of none who, taking the like course, have not suffer'd the like miserys. Notwithstanding the admirable Ver∣tue and Success of <HI>Alexander,</HI> his Reign was full of Conspiracys, and his knowledg of them prompted him to destroy <HI>Parmenio, Philotas, Clitus, Calisthenes, Hermolaus,</HI> and many more of his best Friends. If he e∣scap'd the Sword, he fell by Poison. The Murder of his Wives, Mo∣ther, and Children, by the rage of his own Soldiers; the Fury of his Captains imploy'd in mutual Slaughters, till they were consum'd; his pa∣ternal Kingdom after many Revolutions transfer'd to <HI>Cassander</HI> his most mortal Enemy; the utter extinction of his conquering Army, and parti∣cularly the famous <HI>Argyraspides,</HI> who being grown faithless and seditious, after the death of <HI>Eumenes</HI> were sent to perish in unknown parts of the East, abundantly testify the admirable stability, good order, peace, and quiet that is enjoy'd under absolute Monarchy. The next Government of the like nature that appear'd upon the Stage of the World was that of <HI>Rome,</HI> introduc'd by Wars that consum'd two thirds of the People; con∣firm'd by Proscriptions, in which all that were eminent for Nobility, Riches, or Vertue, perish'd. The peace they had under <HI>Augustus</HI> was like that which the Devil allow'd to the Child in the Gospel, whom he rent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 9. 26.</NOTE>sorely, and left as dead. The miserable City was only cast into a Swound: after long and violent vexations by Seditions, Tumults, and Wars, it lay as dead; and finding no helper like to him who cur'd the Child, it was deliver'd to new Devils to be tormented, till it was utterly destroy'd. <HI>Tiberius</HI> was appointed as a fit instrument for such a purpose. It was thought that those who should feel the effects of his Pride, Cruelty, and Lust, would look upon the Death of <HI>Augustus</HI> as a loss. He perform'd the work for which he was chosen; his Reign was an uninterrupted Se∣ries of Murders, Subornations, Perjurys, and Poisonings, intermix'd with the most detestable Impuritys, the revolts of Provinces, and Muti∣nys of Armys. The matter was not mended by his Successors: <HI>Caligula</HI> was kill'd by his own Guards; <HI>Claudius</HI> poison'd by his Wife: <HI>Spain, Gaul, Germany, Pannonia, Maesia, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> revolted at once from <HI>Nero;</HI> the People and Senat follow'd the example of the Provinces. This I think was, in our Author's sense, Sedition with a witness. <HI>Nero</HI> being dead by the hand of a Slave, or his own, to prevent that of the Hangman, <HI>Galba</HI> enter'd the City with Blood and Slaughter; but when his own Soldiers found he would not give the Mony for which they intended to sell the Empire, they kill'd him: and to shew the stability of Absolute Monarchy, it may be observ'd, that this was not done by the advice of the Senat, or by a conspiracy of great men; <HI>Suscepere duo ma∣nipulares</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit. Hist▪ l. 1.</NOTE><HI>Populi Romani Imperium transferendum, &amp; transtulerunt.</HI> Two Rascals gave the Empire to <HI>Otho,</HI> and the whole Senat was like to be butcher'd for not being so ready to follow their venerable Authority as they ought to have bin, and hardly escap'd the fury of their mad and drunken Companions. As a farther testimony that these Monarchys are not subject to Seditions and Tumults, he had at once only two Competi∣tors against whom he was to defend the well-acquir'd Empire: His Ar∣my was deseated at <HI>Brescia,</HI> he kill'd himself; and his Successor <HI>Vitellius</HI> was soon after thrown into the Common-shore. The same method still continu'd: <HI>Rome</HI> was fill'd with Blood and Ashes; and to recite all the
<PB N="164" REF="172"/>
 publick Mischiefs would be to transcribe the History: For as <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> be∣ing ask'd who should succeed him, answer'd, He who has the sharpest Sword; that was the only Law that govern'd in the following ages. Whoever could corrupt two or three Legions, thought he had a good ti∣tle to the Empire; and unless he happen'd to be kill'd by Treachery, or another Tumult of his own Soldiers, he seldom receded from it without a Battel, wherein he that was most successful, had no other security than what the present temper of the Soldiers afforded him: and the miserable Provinces having neither Vertue nor Force, were oblig'd slavishly to follow the fury or fortune of those Villains. In this state did <HI>Rome</HI> de∣dicate to <HI>Constantine</HI> the Triumphal Arch that had bin prepar'd for <HI>Maxentius;</HI> and those Provinces which had set up <HI>Albinus</HI> and <HI>Niger</HI> submitted to <HI>Septimius Severus.</HI> In the vast variety of Accidents that in those Ages disturb'd the World, no Emperor had a better title than what he purchas'd by Mony or Violence; and enjoy'd it no longer than those helps continu'd, which of all things were the most uncertain. By this means most of the Princes perish'd by the Sword, <HI>Italy</HI> was made deso∣late, and <HI>Rome</HI> was several times sack'd and burnt. The Mistress of the World being made a Slave, the Provinces which had bin acquir'd by the Blood of her antient vertuous Citizens, became part of an Usurper's Patrimony, who without any regard to the publick good, distributed 'em to his Children according to their number, or his passion. These ei∣ther destroy'd one another, or fell under the Sword of a third who had the fortune of their Father, the greatest part most commonly falling to the share of the worst. If at any time the contrary happen'd, the Go∣vernment of the best was but a lucid interval, and well-wishing men grew more extremely to abhor the darkness that follow'd when they were gone. The best of 'em could do no more than suspend mischief for a while, but could not correct the corrupt principle of their Government; and some of 'em were destroy'd as soon as they were thought to intend it: Others who finish'd their days in peace, left the Empire to such per∣sons of their relations as were most unlike to them. <HI>Domitian</HI> came in as Brother to <HI>Titus. Commodus</HI> and <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> were recommended by the memory of those Vertues that had bin found in <HI>Antoninus</HI> and <HI>Aure∣lius. Honorius</HI> and <HI>Arcadius,</HI> who by their baseness brought utter ruin upon the Western and Eastern Empires, were the Sons of the brave <HI>Theo∣dosius.</HI> They who could keep their hands free from Blood, and their Hearts from Malice, Covetousness, and Pride, could not transmit their Vertues to their Successors, nor correct the perverseness that lay at the root and foundation of their Government. The whole mass of Blood was vitia∣ted: the Body was but one vast Sore, which no hand but that of the Al∣mighty could heal; and he who from an abhorrence of iniquity had de∣clar'd he would not hear the crys of his own people, when they had cho∣sen the thing that was not good, would not shew mercy to Strangers who had done the same thing.</P>
<P>I have insisted upon the <HI>Hebrew, Macedonian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Historys, be∣cause they are the most eminent and best known to us: We are in the dark concerning the <HI>Babylonian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Bactrian,</HI> and <HI>Egyp∣tian</HI> Monarchys: We know little more of them than the Scripture occa∣sionally relates concerning their barbarous cruelty, bestial pride, and ex∣travagant folly. Others have bin like to them, and I know not where to find a peaceable Monarchy unless it be in <HI>Peru,</HI> where the <HI>Ynca Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilasso de la Vega</HI> says, that a Man and a Woman, Children of the Sun and the
<PB N="165" REF="173"/>
Moon, appearing amongst a barbarous people living without any Reli∣gion or Law, establish'd a Government amongst them, which continu'd in much Peace and Justice for twelve Generations: But this seeming to be as fabulous as their Birth, we may pass it over, and fix upon those that are better known; of which there is not one that has not suffer'd more dan∣gerous and mischievous Seditions, than all the popular Governments that have bin in the World: And the condition of those Kingdoms which are not absolute, and yet give a preference to Birth, without consideration of Merit or Vertue, is not much better.</P>
<P>This is prov'd by the Reasons of those Seditions and Tumults, as well as from the Fact it self.</P>
<P>The Reasons arise from the violence of the Passions that incite men to them, and the intricacy of the Questions concerning Succession.</P>
<P>Every man has Passions; few know how to moderate, and no one can wholly extinguish them. As they are various in their nature, so they are govern'd by various Objects; and men usually follow that which is pre∣dominant in them, whether it proceed from Anger or Desire, and whe∣ther it terminate in Ambition, Covetousness, Lust, or any other more or less blamable Appetite. Every manner of life furnishes something, that in some measure may foment these; but a Crown comprehends all that can be grateful to the most violent and vicious. He who is covetous, has vast Revenues, besides what he may get by fraud and rapine, to satisfy his Appetite. If he be given to Sensuality, the variety of pleasures, and the facility of accomplishing whatever he desires, tends farther to inflame that Passion. Such as are ambitious, are incited by the greatness of their Power to attempt great matters; and the most sottish or lazy may dis∣charge themselves of Cares, and hope that others will be easily hir'd to take the burden of Business upon them whilst they lie at ease. They who naturally incline to pride and cruelty, are more violently tempted to usurp Dominion; and the wicked Advices of Flatterers, always con∣curring with their Passions, incite them to exercise the Power they have gotten with the utmost rigor, to satiate their own rage, and to secure themselves against the effects of the publick hatred, which they know they have deserv'd. If there be, as our Author says, no other Rule than Force and Success, and that he must be taken for the Father of a People who is in possession of a Power over them; whoever has the one, may put the other to a trial. Nay, even those who have regard to Justice, will seldom want Reasons to persuade them that it is on their side. Something may be amiss in the State; Injurys may be done to themselves and their Friends. Such Honors may be deny'd as they think they de∣serve; or others of less Merit, as they suppose, may be prefer'd before them. Men do so rarely make a right estimate of their own Merits, that those who mean well may be often deceiv'd: and if nothing but Success be requir'd to make a Monarch, they may think it just to attempt whatever they can hope to accomplish. This was the case of <HI>Julius Cae∣sar;</HI> he thought all things <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Viribus utendum est quas fecimus: arma cenenti</L>
<L>Omnia dat qui justa negat. <BIBL>Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE> lawful, when the Consulat, which he sup∣pos'd he had deserv'd, was deny'd. These Enterprizes seem to belong to men of great Spirits; but there are none so base not to be capable of un∣dertaking, and (as things may stand) of bringing 'em to perfection. Hi∣story
<PB N="166" REF="174"/>
 represents no man under a more contemptible character of sottis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Laziness, Cowardice, and Drunkenness, than <HI>Vitellius;</HI> no one more impure and sordid than <HI>Galba: Otho</HI> was advanc'd for being in his man∣ners like to <HI>Nero: Vespasian</HI> was scorn'd for his Avarice, till the Power fell into such hands as made the world believe none could be unworthy of the Empire; and in the following Ages the worst men by the worst means most frequently obtain'd it.</P>
<P>These Wounds are not cur'd by saying, that the Law of God and Na∣ture prevents this mischief, by annexing the Succession of Crowns to proximity of Blood; for mankind had not bin continually afflicted with them if there had bin such a Law, or that they could have bin prevent∣ed by it: and tho there were such a Law, yet more Questions would a∣rise about that Proximity, than any wise man would dare to determin. The Law can be of no effect, unless there be a Power to decide the Con∣tests arising upon it: But the fundamental Maxim of the great Monar∣chys is, that there can be no <HI>Interregnum:</HI> The Heir of the Crown is in possession, as soon as he who did injoy it is dead. <HI>Le Mort,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> say, <HI>Saisit le vif:</HI> There can be therefore no such Law, or it serves for nothing. If there be Judges to interpret the Law, no man is a King till judgment be given in his favor; and he is not King by his own Title, but by the Sentence given by them. If there be none, the Law is merely imaginary, and every man may in his own case make it what he pleases. He who has a Crown in his view, and Arms in his hand, wants nothing but success to make him a King; and if he prospers, all men are oblig'd to obey him.</P>
<P>'Tis a folly to say the matter is clear, and needs no decision; for every man knows that no Law concerning privat Inheritances can be so exactly drawn, but many Controversys will arise upon it, that must be decided by a Power to which both Partys are subject: and the disputes concerning Kingdoms are so much the more difficult, because this Law is no where to be found; and the more dangerous, because the Competitors are for the most part more powerful.</P>
<P>Again, this Law must either be general to all Mankind, or particular to each Nation. If particular, a matter of such importance requires good proof, when, where, how, and by whom it was given to every one. But the Scriptures testifying to the contrary, that God gave Laws to the <HI>Jews</HI> only, and that no such thing as hereditary Monarchy, ac∣cording to proximity of Blood, was prescrib'd by them, we may safely say, that God never gave any such Law to every particular, nor to any Nation. If he did not give it to any one, he did not give it to all, for eve∣ry one is comprehended in all; and if no one has it, 'tis impossible that all can have it; or that it should be obligatory to all, when no man knows or can tell, when, where, and by what hand it was given, nor what is the sense of it: all which is evident by the various Laws and Customs of Nations in the disposal of hereditary Successions: And no one of them, that we know, has to this day bin able to shew that the method follow'd by them, is more according to nature than that of others.</P>
<P>If our Author pretends to be God's Interpreter, and to give the solu∣tion of these doubts, I may ask which of the five following ways are appointed by God, and then we may examin Cases resulting from them.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="175"/>
1. In <HI>France, Turky,</HI> and other places, the Succession comes to the next Male, in the streight eldest Line, according to which the Son is pre∣fer'd before the Brother of him who last enjoy'd the Crown, (as the present King of <HI>France</HI> before his Uncle the Duke of <HI>Orleans)</HI> and the Son of the eldest before the Brothers of the eldest; as in the case of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second of <HI>England,</HI> who was advanc'd preferably to all the Brothers of the black Prince his Father.</P>
<P>2. Others keep to the Males of the reigning Family, yet have more regard to the eldest Man than to the eldest Line: and Representation tak∣ing no place among them, the eldest Man is thought to be nearest to the first King; and a second Son of the Person that last reign'd, to be nearer to him than his Grandchild by the eldest Son: according to which Rule, any one of the Sons of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third remaining after his death, should have bin prefer'd before <HI>Richard</HI> the Second who was his Grand∣child.</P>
<P>3. In the two cases beforemention'd, no manner of regard is had to Fe∣males, who being thought naturally uncapable of commanding Men, or performing the Functions of a Magistrate, are, together with their De∣scendents, utterly excluded from the supreme as well as from the inferior Magistracys; and in <HI>Turky, France,</HI> and other great Kingdoms, have no pretence to any Title: But in some places, and particularly in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> the advantages of Proximity belong to them as well as to Males; by which means our Crown has bin transported to several Familys and Nations.</P>
<P>4. As in some places they are utterly rejected, and in others receiv'd simply without any condition; so those are not wanting, where that of not marrying out of the Country, or without the consent of the Estates, is impos'd, of which <HI>Sweden</HI> is an Example.</P>
<P>5. In some places Proximity of Blood is only regarded, whether the Issue be legitimate, or illegitimate; in others Bastards are wholly ex∣cluded.</P>
<P>By this variety of Judgments made by several Nations upon this Point, it may appear, that tho it were agreed by all that the next in Blood ought to succeed, yet such Contests would arise upon the interpretation and ap∣plication of the general Rule, as must necessarily be a perpetual Spring of irreconcilable and mortal Quarrels.</P>
<P>If any man say, The Rule observ'd in <HI>England</HI> is that which God gave to Mankind; I leave him first to dispute that point with the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> and many others, who can have no right to the Crowns they wear, if it be admitted; and in the next place to prove that our Ance∣stors had a more immediate communication with God, and a more certain knowledg of his Will than others, who for any thing we know, may be of Authority equal to them: But in the mean time we may rationally conclude, that if there be such a Rule, we have had no King in <HI>England</HI> for the space of almost a thousand years, having not had one who did not come to the Crown by a most manifest violation of it; as appears by the forecited Examples of <HI>William</HI> the First and Second; <HI>Henry</HI> the First; <HI>Henry</HI> the Second and his Children; <HI>John, Edward</HI> the Third, <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth and his Children; <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, and all that claim under any of them. And if Possession or Success can give a right, it will I think follow, that <HI>Jack Straw, Wat Tyler, Perkin War∣beck,</HI> or any other Rascal, might have had it if he had bin as happy as bold in his Enterprize. This is no less than to expose Crowns to the first
<PB N="168" REF="176"/>
 that can seize them, to destroy all Law and Rule, and to render Right a slave to Fortune. If this be so, a late Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> whose under∣standing was not thought great, judg'd rightly when he said his Grandfa∣ther was a wise man tho he could neither write nor read, in as much as he resolv'd to follow the Crown, tho it were upon a Coalstaff. But if this be sufficient to make a wise man, 'tis pity the secret was no sooner disco∣ver'd, since many, who for want of it liv'd and dy'd in all the infamy that justly accompanys Knavery, Cowardice and Folly, might have gain'd the reputation of the most excellent Men in their several ages. The bloody Factions with which all Nations subject to this sort of Mo∣narchy have bin perpetually vex'd, might have bin prevented by throw∣ing up cross or pile, or by battel between the Competitors body to body, as was done by <HI>Corbis</HI> and <HI>Orsua, Cleorestes</HI> and <HI>Polinices, Ironside</HI> and <HI>Canutus;</HI> it being most unreasonable, or rather impiously absurd, for any to venture their Lives and Fortunes, when their Consciences are not concern'd in the Contest, and that they are to gain nothing by the Victory.</P>
<P>If Reason teaches, that till this expeditious way of ending Controver∣sys be receiv'd, the Ambition of men will be apt to imbroil Nations in their Quarrels; and others judging variously of those matters, which can be reduc'd to no certain Rule, will think themselves in Conscience oblig'd to follow the party that seems to them to be most just: Experience mani∣fests the same, and that Ambition has produc'd more violent mischiefs than all the other desires and passions that have ever possest the hearts of men. That this may appear, it will not be amiss to divide these mischiefs, into such as proceed from him who is in possession of the Power, thro jea∣lousy of State, as they call it, to prevent the enterprizes of those who would dispossess him, and such as arise between Competitors contending for it.</P>
<P><HI>Tarquin</HI>'s Counsel concerning the Poppys, and <HI>Periander</HI>'s heads of Corn, are of the first sort. The most eminent are always most fear'd, as the readiest to undertake, and most able to accomplish great Designs. This eminence proceeds from Birth, Riches, Vertue, or Reputation, and is sometimes wrought up to the greatest height by a conjunction of all these. But I know not where to find an example of such a man, who could long subsist under Absolute Monarchy. If he be of high Birth, he must, like <HI>Brutus,</HI> conceal his Vertue, and gain no reputation, or re∣solve to perish, if he do not prevent his own death by that of the Ty∣rant: All other ways are ineffectual; the suspicions, fears and hatred thereupon arising, are not to be remov'd: Personal respects are forgotten, and such services as cannot be sufficiently valu'd, must be blotted out by the death of those who did them. Various ways may be taken, and pre∣tences us'd according to the temper of Times and Nations; but the thing must be done; and whether it be colour'd by a trick of Law, or per∣form'd by a Mute with a Bowstring, imports little. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth was made King by the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and his brave Son <HI>Hot∣spur; Edward</HI> the fourth by the valiant Earl of <HI>Warwick; Henry</HI> the se∣venth by <HI>Stanley:</HI> but neither of 'em could think himself safe, till his Benefactor was dead. No continu'd fidelity, no testimonys of modesty and humility can prevent this. The modesty of <HI>Germanicus</HI> in rejecting the Honors that were offer'd to him, and his industry in quieting the mu∣tiny'd Legions, accelerated his ruin: When 'twas evident he might be Emperor if he pleas'd, he must be so, or die: There was no middle stati∣on
<PB N="169" REF="177"/>
between the Throne and the Grave. 'Tis probable that <HI>Caligula, Nero,</HI> and other Beasts like to them, might hate Vertue for the good which is in it; but I cannot think that either they, their Predecessors or Successors, would have put themselves upon the desperate design of extir∣pating it, if they had not found it to be inconsistent with their Govern∣ment; and that being once concluded, they spar'd none of their nearest Relations. <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> kill'd his Son <HI>Darius: Herod</HI> murder'd the best of his Wives, and all his Sons except the worst. <HI>Tiberius</HI> destroy'd <HI>Agrippa Postuhmus,</HI> and <HI>Germanicus</HI> with his Wife and two Sons. How highly so∣ever <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great be commended, he was polluted with the Blood of his Father-in-law, Wife, and Son. <HI>Philip</HI> the second of <HI>Spain</HI> did in like manner deliver himself from his fears of <HI>Don Carlos;</HI> and 'tis not doubted that <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth, for the same reasons, dispatch'd his Bro∣ther <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> and his Son <HI>Balthasar.</HI> The like cases were so common in <HI>England,</HI> that all the <HI>Plantagenets,</HI> and the noble Familys ally'd to them, being extinguish'd, our Ancestors were sent to seek a King in one of the meanest in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>This method being known, those who are unwilling to die so tamely, endeavour to find out ways of defending themselves; and there being no other than the death of the Person who is in the Throne, they usually seek to compass it by secret Conspiracy, or open Violence; and the number of Princes that have bin destroy'd, and Countrys disturb'd by those who thro fear have bin driven to extremitys, is not much less than of those who have suffer'd the like from men following the impulse of their own Ambition.</P>
<P>The disorders arising from Contests between several Competitors, be∣fore any one could be settled in the possession of Kingdoms, have bin no less frequent and bloody than those above-mention'd; and the miserys suffer'd by them, together with the ruin brought upon the Empires of <HI>Macedon</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> may be sufficient to prove it: however to make the matter more clear, I shall alledg others. But because it may be presump∣tion in me to think I know all the Historys of the World, or tedious to relate all those I know, I shall content my self with some of the most eminent and remarkable: And if it appears they have all suffer'd the same mischiefs, we may believe they proceed not from Accidents, but from the power of a permanent Cause, that always produces the same or the like Effects.</P>
<P>To begin with <HI>France.</HI> The Succession not being well settled in the time of <HI>Meroveus,</HI> who had dispossest the Grandchildren of <HI>Pharamond,</HI> he was no sooner dead than <HI>Gillon</HI> set up himself, and with much slaughter drove his Son <HI>Chilperic</HI> out of the Kingdom; who after a little time re∣turning with like fury, is said to have seen a Vision, first of Lions and Leo∣pards, then of Bears and Wolves, and lastly of Dogs and Cats, all tear∣ing one another to pieces. This has bin always accounted by the <HI>French</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. de France en la Vie de Chil∣peric 1.</NOTE>to be a representation of the nature and fortune of the three Races that were to command them, and has bin too much verify'd by experi∣ence. <HI>Clovis</HI> their first Christian and most renowned King, having by good means or evil exceedingly enlarg'd his Territorys, but chiefly by the murders of <HI>Alaric,</HI> and <HI>Ragnacaire</HI> with his Children, and suborning <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezeray &amp; de Serres.</NOTE><HI>Sigismond</HI> of <HI>Metz</HI> to kill his Father <HI>Sigebert,</HI> left his Kingdom to be torn in pieces by the rage of his four Sons, each of 'em endeavouring to make himself Master of the whole; and when, according to the usual fate of such Contests, success had crown'd <HI>Clothair,</HI> who was the worst of 'em
<PB N="170" REF="178"/>
 all, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laughter of his Brothers and Nephews, with all the flower of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Gaulish</HI> Nobility, the advantages of his Fortune only re∣sulted to his own person. For after his death the miserable Nations suf∣fer'd as much srom the madness of his Sons, as they had done by himself and his Brothers. They had learn'd from their Predecessors not to be slow in doing mischief, but were farther incited by the rage of two infa∣mous Strumpets, <HI>Fredegonde</HI> and <HI>Brunehaud,</HI> which is a sort of Vermin that, I am inclin'd to think, has not usually govern'd Senats or Popular Assemblys. <HI>Chilperic</HI> the second, who by the slaughter of many Persons of the Royal Blood, with infinite numbers of the Nobility and People, came to be Master of so much of the Country as procur'd him the name of King of <HI>France,</HI> kill'd his eldest Son on suspicion he was excited a∣gainst him by <HI>Brunehaud,</HI> and his second, lest he should revenge the death of his Brother: he marry'd <HI>Fredegonde,</HI> and was soon after kill'd by her Adulterer <HI>Landry.</HI> The Kingdom continu'd in the same misery thro the rage of the surviving Princes, and found no relief, tho most of 'em fell by the Sword; and that <HI>Brunehaud</HI> who had bin a principal Cause of those Tragedys, was ty'd to the tails of four wild Horses, and suffer'd a death as foul as her life. These were Lions and Leopards. They in∣volv'd the Kingdom in desperate troubles; but being Men of valor and industry, they kept up in some measure the Reputation and Power of the Nation, and he who attain'd to the Crown defended it. But they being fallen by the hands of each other, the poisonous Root put forth another Plague more mortal than their Fury. The vigor was spent, and the Suc∣cession becoming more settled, ten base and slothful Kings, by the <HI>French</HI> called <HI>Les Roys faineans,</HI> succeeded. Some may say, They who do no∣thing, do no hurt; but the Rule is false in relation to Kings. He that takes upon him the Government of a People, can do no greater evil than by doing nothing, nor be guilty of a more unpardonable Crime, than by Negligence, Cowardice, Voluptuousness, and Sloth, to desert his charge. Vertue and Manhood perish under him; good Disciplin is for∣gotten; Justice slighted; the Laws perverted or render'd useless; the People corrupted; the publick Treasures exhausted; and the Power of the Government always falling into the hands of Flatterers, Whores, Favorites, Bauds, and such base Wretches as render it contemptible, a way is laid open for all manner of disorders. The greatest cruelty that has bin known in the world, if accompany'd with wit and courage, never did so much hurt as this slothful bestiality; or rather these slothful Beasts have ever bin most cruel. The Reigns of <HI>Septimius Severus, Ma∣homet</HI> the second, or <HI>Selim</HI> the second, were cruel and bloody; but their fury was turn'd against Foreigners, and some of their near Rela∣tions, or against such as fell under the suspicion of making attempts against them: The condition of the People was tolerable; those who would be quiet might be safe; the Laws kept their right course; the Re∣putation of the Empire was maintain'd, the Limits defended, and the publick Peace preserv'd. But when the Sword past into the hands of leud, slothful, foolish, and cowardly Princes, it was of no power against foreign Enemys, or the disturbers of domestic Peace, tho always sharp against the best of their own Subjects. No man knew how to secure himself against them, unless by raising civil Wars; which will always be srequent, when a Crown defended by a weak hand is propos'd as a Prize to any that dare invade it. This is a perpetual Spring of disorders; and no Nation was ever quiet, when the most eminent men found less danger in the most violent Attempts, than in submitting patiently to the
<PB N="171" REF="179"/>
Will of a Prince, that suffers his Power to be manag'd by vile Persons, who get credit by flattering him in his Vices. But this is not all; such Princes naturally hate and fear those who excel them in Vertue and Re∣putation, as much as they are inferior to them in Fortune; and think their Persons cannot be secur'd, nor their Authority enlarg'd, except by their destruction. 'Tis ordinary for them, <HI>inter scorta &amp; ganeas prin∣cipibus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit.</NOTE><HI>viris perniciem machinare,</HI> and to make Cruelty a cover to Igno∣rance and Cowardice. Besides the Mischiefs brought upon the Publick by the loss of eminent Men, who are the Pillars of every State, such Reigns are always accompany'd with Tumults and Civil Wars, the great Men striving with no less violence who shall get the weak Prince into his power, when such regard is had to succession that they think it not fit to devest him of the Title, than when with less respect they contend for the Sovereignty it self. And whilst this sort of Princes reign'd, <HI>France</HI> was not less afflicted with the Contests between <HI>Grimbauld, Ebroin, Grimoald,</HI> and others, for the Mayoralty of the Palace, than they had bin before by the rage of those Princes who had contested for the Crown. The Issue also was the same: After many Re∣volutions, <HI>Charles Martel</HI> gain'd the Power of the Kingdom, which he had so bravely defended against the <HI>Saracens;</HI> and having transmitted it to his Son <HI>Pepin,</HI> the General Assembly of Estates, with the approbation of Mankind, confer'd the Title also upon him. This gave the Nation ease for the present; but the deep-rooted Evil could not be so cur'd; and the Kingdom, that by the Wisdom, Valor, and Reputation of <HI>Pepin,</HI> had bin preserv'd from civil Troubles during his life, fell as deeply as ever into them so soon as he was dead. His Sons, <HI>Carloman</HI> and <HI>Charles,</HI> di∣vided the Dominions, but in a little time each of them would have all. <HI>Carloman</HI> fill'd the Kingdom with Tumult; rais'd the <HI>Lombards,</HI> and march'd with a great Army against his Brother, till his course was inter∣rupted by death, caus'd, as is suppos'd, by such helps as Princes liberally afford to their aspiring Relations. <HI>Charles</HI> depriv'd his two Sons of their Inheritance, put them in Prison, and we hear no more of them. His third Brother <HI>Griffon</HI> was not more quiet, nor more successful; and there could be no Peace in <HI>Gascony, Italy,</HI> or <HI>Germany,</HI> till he was kill'd. But all the Advantages which <HI>Charles,</HI> by an extraordinary Vertue and Fortune, had purchas'd for his Country, ended with his Life. He left his Son <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Gentle</HI> in possession of the Empire, and Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> and his Grandson <HI>Bernard</HI> King of <HI>Italy:</HI> But these two could not agree, and <HI>Bernard</HI> falling into the hands of <HI>Lewis,</HI> was depriv'd of his Eyes, and some time after kill'd. This was not enough to preserve the Peace: <HI>Lothair, Lewis</HI> and <HI>Pepin,</HI> all three Sons to <HI>Lewis,</HI> rebel'd against him; call'd a Council at <HI>Lions,</HI> depos'd him, and divided the Empire amongst themselves. After five years he escap'd from the Monastery where he had bin kept, renew'd the War, and was again taken Prisoner by <HI>Lo∣thair.</HI> When he was dead, the War broke out more fiercely than ever between his Children: <HI>Lothair</HI> the Fmperor assaulted <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Ba∣varia</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> King of <HI>Rhetia;</HI> was defeated by them, and confin'd to a Monastery, where he dy'd. New Quarrels arose between the two Brothers, upon the division of the Countrys taken from him, and <HI>Lor∣rain</HI> only was lest to his Son. <HI>Lewis</HI> dy'd soon after, and <HI>Charles</HI> getting possession of the Empire and Kingdom, ended an inglorious Reign in an unprosperous attempt to deprive <HI>Hermingrade,</HI> Daughter to his Brother <HI>Lewis,</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Arles,</HI> and other places left to her by her Fa∣ther.
<PB N="172" REF="180"/>
 <HI>Lewis</HI> his Son, call'd the <HI>Stutterer,</HI> reign'd two years in much trouble; and his only legitimate Son, <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Simple,</HI> came not to the Crown till after the death of his two Bastard Brothers, <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Carlo∣man, Charles le Gros,</HI> and <HI>Eudes</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou. Charles le Gros</HI> was depos'd from the Empire and Kingdom, strip'd of his Goods, and left to perish thro poverty in an obscure Village. <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Simple,</HI> and the Nations under him, thriv'd no better: <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> rais'd War against him, and was crown'd at <HI>Rheims;</HI> but was himself slain soon af∣ter in a bloody battel near <HI>Soissons.</HI> His Son-in-law, <HI>Hebert</HI> Earl of <HI>Ver∣mandois,</HI> gather'd up the remains of his scatter'd Party, got <HI>Charles</HI> into his power, and call'd a General Assembly of Estates, who depos'd him, and gave the Crown to <HI>Raoul</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy;</HI> tho he was no other∣wise related to the Royal Blood than by his Mother, which in <HI>France</HI> is nothing at all. He being dead, <HI>Lewis</HI> Son to the depos'd <HI>Charles</HI> was made King; but his Reign was as inglorious to him, as miserable to his Subjects. This is the Peace which the <HI>French</HI> enjoy'd for the space of five or six Ages under their Monarchy; and 'tis hard to determin whether they suffer'd most by the Violence of those who possest, or the Ambition of others who aspir'd to the Crown; and whether the fury of active, or the baseness of slothful Princes was most pernicious to them: But upon the whole matter, thro the defects of those of the latter sort, they lost all they had gain'd by sweat and blood under the conduct of the former. <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Otho</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> by a Vertue like that of <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> depriv'd them of the Empire, and settled it in <HI>Germany,</HI> leaving <HI>France</HI> only to <HI>Lewis</HI> sirnam'd <HI>Outremer,</HI> and his Son <HI>Lothair.</HI> These seem'd to be e∣qually compos'd of Treachery, Cruelty, Ambition, and Baseness: They were always mutinous, and always beaten: Their frantick Passions put 'em always upon unjust designs, and were such plagues to their Subjects and Neighbours, that they became equally detested and despis'd. These things extinguish'd the veneration due to the memory of <HI>Pepin</HI> and <HI>Charles;</HI> and oblig'd the whole Nation rather to seek relief from a Stranger, than to be ruin'd by their worthless Descendents. They had try'd all ways that were in their power, depos'd four crowned Kings within the space of a hundred and fifty years; crown'd five who had no other Title than the People confer'd upon them, and restor'd the Descen∣dents of those they had rejected, but all was in vain: Their Vices were incorrigible, the Mischiefs produc'd by them intolerable; they never ceas'd from murdering one another in battel, or by treachery, and bring∣ing the Nation into Civil Wars upon their wicked or foolish Quarrels, till the whole Race was rejected, and the Crown plac'd upon the head of <HI>Hugh Capet.</HI> These Mischiess rag'd not in the same extremity under him and his Descendents, but the abatement proceeded from a cause no way advantageous to Absolute Monarchy. The <HI>French</HI> were by their Cala∣mitys taught more strictly to limit the Regal Power; and by turning the Dukedoms and Earldoms into Patrimonys, which had bin Offices, gave an Authority to the chief of the Nobility, by which that of Kings was curb'd; and tho by this means the Commonalty were expos'd to some Pressures, yet they were small in comparison of what they had suffer'd in sormer times. When many great Men had Estates of their own that did not depend upon the Will of Kings, they grew to love their Coun∣try; and tho they chearfully serv'd the Crown in all cases of publick Concernment, they were not easily engag'd in the personal quarrels of those who possest it, or had a mind to gain it. To preserve themselves
<PB N="173" REF="181"/>
in this condition, they were oblig'd to use their Vassals gently; and this continuing in some measure till within the last fifty years, the Monarchy was less tumultuous, than when the King's Will had bin less restrain'd. Nevertheless they had not much reason to boast; there was a Root still remaining, that from time to time produc'd poisonous Fruit: Civil Wars were frequent among them, tho not carry'd on with such desperate mad∣ness as formerly; and many of them upon the account of disputes be∣tween Competitors for the Crown. All the Wars with <HI>England,</HI> since <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the Second marry'd <HI>Isabella</HI> Daughter, and, as he pretended, Heir of <HI>Philip Le Bel,</HI> were of this nature. The defeats of <HI>Crecy, Poitiers,</HI> and <HI>Agincourt,</HI> with the slaughters and devastations suffer'd from <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, the black Prince, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth, were merely upon Con∣tests for the Crown. The Factions of <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>Burgundy, Orleans</HI> and <HI>Armagnac,</HI> proceeded from the same Spring; and the Murders that seem to have bin the immediate causes of those Quarrels, were only the effects of the hatred growing from their competition. The more odious, tho less bloody Contests between <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th,</HI> and his Father <HI>Charles</HI> the 7<HI>th,</HI> with the jealousy of the former against his Son <HI>Charles</HI> the 8<HI>th,</HI> arose from the same Principle. <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Bourbon</HI> prepar'd to fill <HI>France</HI> with Fire and Blood upon the like quarrel, when his Designs were over∣thrown by his death in the assault of <HI>Rome.</HI> If the Dukes of <HI>Guise</HI> had bin more fortunate, they had soon turn'd the cause of Religion into a claim to the Crown, and repair'd the Injury done, as they pretended, to <HI>Pepin</HI>'s Race, by destroying that of <HI>Capet:</HI> And <HI>Henry</HI> the Third think∣ing to prevent this by the slaughter of <HI>Henry le Balafré,</HI> and his Brother the Cardinal <HI>de Guise,</HI> brought ruin upon himself, and cast the Kingdom into a most horrid confusion. Our own Age furnishes us with more than one attempt of the same kind, attended with the like success. The Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was several times in arms against <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th</HI> his Brother; the Queen-mother drew the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to favour him; <HI>Montmorency</HI> pe∣rish'd in his Quarrel; <HI>Fontrailles</HI> reviv'd it by a Treaty with <HI>Spain,</HI> which struck at the King's head as well as the Cardinal's, and was supprest by the death of <HI>Cinq Mars</HI> and <HI>de Thou.</HI> Those who understand the Affairs of that Kingdom, make no doubt that the Count <HI>de Soissons</HI> would have set up for himself, and bin follow'd by the best part of <HI>France,</HI> if he had not bin kill'd in the pursuit of his Victory at the Battel of <HI>Sedan.</HI> Since that time the Kingdom has suffer'd such Disturbances as show, that more was intended than the removal of <HI>Mazarin:</HI> And the <HI>Marechal de Turenne</HI> was often told, that the check he gave to the Prince of <HI>Condé</HI> at <HI>Gien,</HI> af∣ter he had defeated <HI>Hocquincourt,</HI> had preserv'd the Crown upon the King's Head. And to testify the Stability, good Order, and domestick Peace that accompanys Absolute Monarchy, we have in our own days seen the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> often divided within it self; the Duke of <HI>Or∣leans,</HI> the Count <HI>de Soissons,</HI> and the Princes of <HI>Condé</HI> and <HI>Conti</HI> in war against the King; the Dukes of <HI>Angoulesme, Vendome, Longueville,</HI> the Count <HI>de Moret,</HI> and other Bastards of the Royal Family, following their example; the Houses of <HI>Guise, D' Elbeuf, Bouillon, Nemours, Rochefo∣cault,</HI> and almost all the most eminent in <HI>France,</HI> with the Parliaments of <HI>Paris, Bourdeaux,</HI> and some others, joining with them. I might alledg ma∣ny more Examples, to shew that this Monarchy, as well as all others, has from the first establishment bin full of blood and slaughter, thro the vio∣lence of those who possest the Crown, and the Ambition of such as a∣spir'd to it; and that the end of one Civil War has bin the beginning
<PB N="174" REF="182"/>
 of another: But I presume upon the whole, these will be thought sufficient to prove, that it never enjoy'd any permanent Domestick Quiet.</P>
<P>The Kingdoms of <HI>Spain</HI> have bin no less disturb'd by the same means; but especially that of <HI>Castile,</HI> where the Kings had more power than in other places. To cite all the Examples, were to transcribe their Histo∣rys; but whoever has leisure to examin them will find, that after many troubles, <HI>Alphonso</HI> the Second, notwithstanding his glorious sirname of <HI>Wise,</HI> was depos'd by means of his ambitious Son: <HI>Don Alonso,</HI> sirnam'd <HI>El Desheredado,</HI> supplanted by his Uncle <HI>Don Sancho el bravo: Peter</HI> the Cruel cast from the Throne, and kill'd by his bastard Brother the <HI>Conde de Trastamara.</HI> From the time of the above-nam'd <HI>Alphonso</HI> to that of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabella,</HI> containing about two hundred years, so few of them past without Civil Wars, that I hardly remember two together that were free from them: And whosoever pretends that of late years that Monarchy has bin more quiet, must, if he be ingenuous, confess their Peace is rather to be imputed to the dexterity of removing such Persons as have bin most likely to raise Disturbances (of which num∣ber were <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria, Don Carlos</HI> Son to <HI>Philip</HI> the Se∣cond, another of the same name Son to <HI>Philip</HI> the Third, and <HI>Don Belthazar</HI> Son to <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth) than to the rectitude of their Con∣stitutions.</P>
<P>He that is not convinc'd of these Truths by what has bin said, may come nearer home, and see what Mischiefs were brought upon <HI>Scotland</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchan. de reb. Scot.</NOTE>by the Contests between <HI>Baliol</HI> and <HI>Bruce,</HI> with their Consequences, till the Crown came to the <HI>Stuart</HI> Family; the quiet Reigns and happy <NOTE PLACE="marg">Drummond. Melvil.</NOTE>Deaths of the five <HI>James</HI>'s, together with the admirable Stability and Peace of the Government under Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and the perfect Union in which she liv'd with her Husband, Son and People, as well as the Happiness of the Nation whilst it lasted.</P>
<P>But the Miserys of <HI>England,</HI> upon the like occasions, surpass all. <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI> was no sooner dead, but the Nation was rent in pieces by his eldest Son <HI>Robert,</HI> contesting with his younger Sons <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> for the Crown. They being all dead and their Sons, the like hap∣pen'd between <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Maud: Henry</HI> the Second was made King to terminate all Disputes, but it prov'd a fruitless Expedient: Such as were more scandalous, and not less dangerous, did soon arise between him and his Sons; who besides the Evils brought upon the Nation, vex'd him to death by their Rebellion. The Reigns of <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Third were yet more tempestuous. <HI>Edward</HI> the Second's leud, foolish, infa∣mous and detestable Government, ended in his deposition and death, to which he was brought by his Wife and Son. <HI>Edward</HI> the Third em∣ploy'd his own and his Subjects Valor against the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots;</HI> but whilst the Foundations were out of order, the Nation could never re∣ceive any advantage by their Victorys: All was calculated for the Glory, and turn'd to the Advantage of one Man. He being dead, all that the <HI>English</HI> held in <HI>Scotland</HI> and in <HI>France,</HI> was lost thro the baseness of his Successor, with more Blood than it had bin gain'd; and the Civil Wars rais'd by his wickedness and madness, ended as those of <HI>Edward</HI> the Se∣cond had done. The Peace of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth's Reign was interrup∣ted by dangerous Civil Wars; and the Victory obtain'd at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> had not perhaps secur'd him in the Throne, if his Death had not pre∣vented new Troubles. <HI>Henry</HI> the Fisth acquir'd such reputation by his
<PB N="175" REF="183"/>
Vertue and Victorys, that none dar'd to invade the Crown during his life; but immediately after his death the Storms prepar'd against his Fa∣mily, broke out with the utmost violence. His Son's weakness encou∣rag'd <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> to set up a new Title, which produc'd such Mischiefs as hardly any People have suffer'd, unlefs upon the like occasi∣on: For besides the slaughter of many thousands of the People, and espe∣cially of those who had bin accustom'd to Arms, the devastation of the best parts of the Kingdom, and the loss of all that our Kings had inhe∣rited in <HI>France,</HI> or gain'd by the blood of their Subjects, fourscore Prin∣ces of the Blood, as <HI>Philip de Commines</HI> calls them, dy'd in Battel, or under the hand of the Hangman. Many of the most noble Familys were extinguish'd; others lost their most eminent Men. Three Kings and two presumptive Heirs of the Crown were murder'd, and the Na∣tion brought to that shameful exigence, to set up a young Man to reign over them, who had no better cover for his sordid extraction than a Welch Pedegree, that might shew how a Tailor was descended from Prince <HI>Arthur, Cadwallader</HI> and <HI>Brutus.</HI> But the Wounds of the Nation were not to be heal'd with such a Plaister. He could not rely upon a Title made up of such stuff, and patch'd with a Marriage to a Princess of a very questionable Birth. His own meanness inclin'd him to hate the Nobility; and thinking it to be as easy for them to take the Crown from him, as to give it to him, he industriously apply'd himself to glean up the Remainders of the House of <HI>York,</HI> from whence a Competitor might arise, and by all means to crush those who were most able to oppose him. This exceedingly weaken'd the Nobility, who held the Balance between him and the Commons, and was a great step towards the disso∣lution of our antient Government: but he was so far from settling the Kingdom in peace, that such Rascals as <HI>Perkin Warbeck</HI> and <HI>Simnel</HI> were able to disturb it. The Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth was turbulent and bloody; that of <HI>Mary</HI> furious, and such as had brought us into subjection to the most powerful, proud and cruel Nation at that time in the World, if God had not wonderfully protected us. Nay, <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> notwithstanding the natural excellency of their Dispo∣sitions, and their knowledg of the Truth in matters of Religion, were forc'd, by that which men call <HI>Jealousy of State,</HI> to foul their hands so of∣ten with illustrious Blood, that if their Reigns deserve to be accounted a∣mongst the most gentle of Monarchys, they were more heavy than the Government of any Commonwealth; and yet their Lives were ne∣ver secure against such as conspir'd against them upon the account of Title.</P>
<P>Having in some measure shew'd what Miserys have bin usually, if not perpetually brought upon Nations subject to Monarchys by the violence of some Princes, and the baseness, folly, and cowardice of others, toge∣ther with what they have suffer'd in Contests for the several Crowns, whilst men divided into divers Factions, strive with as much vehemen∣cy to advance the Person they favour, as if they or their Country were interested in the quarrel; and fight as fiercely for a Master as they might reasonably do to have none; I am not able to determin which of the two Evils is the most mortal. 'Tis evident the Vices of Princes result to the Damage of the People; but whether Pride and Cruelty, or Stupidity and Sloth be the worst, I cannot tell. All Monarchys are subject to be afflicted with Civil Wars: but whether the most frequent and bloody do arise from the quarrels of divers Competitors for Crowns before any one
<PB N="176" REF="184"/>
 gain the possession of them, or afterwards thro the fears of him that would keep what he has gain'd, or the rage of those who would wrest it from him, is not so easily decided. But Commonwealths are less trou∣bled with those Distempers. Women, Children, or such as are notorious∣ly foolish or mad, are never advanc'd to the Supreme Power. Whilst the Laws, and that Disciplin which nourishes Vertue is in force, Men of Wisdom and Valor are never wanting; and every man desires to give testimony of his Vertue, when he knows 'twill be rewarded with Ho∣nor and Power. If unworthy Persons creep into Magistracys, or are by mistake any way prefer'd, their Vices for the most part turn to their own hurt; and the State cannot easily receive any great damage by the incapa∣city of one who is not to continue in Office above a year; and is usually encompast with those who having born, or are aspiring to the same, are by their Vertue able to supply his defects; cannot hope for a Reward from one unable to corrupt 'em, and are sure of the favor of the Senat and Peo∣ple to support 'em in the defence of the publick Interest. As long as this good Order continues, private Quarrels are supprest by the Authority of the Magistrate, or prove to be of little effect. Such as arise between the Nobles and Commons frequently produce good Laws for the maintenance of Liberty, as they did in <HI>Rome</HI> for above three hundred years after the expulsion of <HI>Tarquin;</HI> and almost ever terminate with little or no blood. Sometimes the Errors of one or both Partys are discover'd by the discourse of a wise and good Man; and those who have most violently oppos'd one another become the best Friends, every one joining to remove the evil that causes the division. When the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> seem'd to be most furiously incens'd against each other, the creation of Tribuns, communication of Honors and Marriages between the Patrician and Ple∣beian Familys, or the mitigation of Usury, compos'd all; and these were not only harmless things, but such as gave opportunitys of correcting the defects that had bin in the first Constitution of the Government, without which they could never have attain'd to the Greatness, Glory and Happi∣ness they afterwards enjoy'd. Such as had seen that People meeting in tumult, running thro the City, crying out against the Kings, Consuls, Senat, or <HI>Decemviri,</HI> might have thought they would have fill'd all with blood and slaughter; but no such thing happen'd. They desir'd no more than to take away the Kingdom which <HI>Tarquin</HI> had wickedly u∣surp'd; and never went about so much as to punish one Minister of the mischiefs he had done, or to take away his Goods, till upon pretence of treating, his Embassadors by a new Treachery had cast the City into greater danger than ever. Tho the <HI>Decemviri</HI> had by the like Villanys e∣qually provok'd the People, they were us'd with the like gentleness: <HI>Appius</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv. l. 3.</NOTE><HI>Claudius</HI> and <HI>Oppius</HI> having by voluntary death substracted themselves from publick punishment, their Collegues were only banish'd, and the Magistracys of the City reduc'd to the former order, without the effusion of more blood. They who contended for their just Rights, were satis∣fy'd with the recovery of them; whereas such as follow the impulse of an unruly Ambition, never think themselves safe till they have destroy'd all that seem able to disturb them, and satiated their rage with the blood of their Adversarys. This makes, as well as shews the difference be∣tween the Tumults of <HI>Rome,</HI> or the secession of the common People to Mount <HI>Aventine,</HI> and the Battels of <HI>Towton, Teuxbury, Eveshal, Lewes, Hexham, Barnet, St. Albans,</HI> and <HI>Bosworth.</HI> 'Tis in vain to say these ought rather to be compar'd to those of <HI>Pharsalia, Actium,</HI> or <HI>Philippi;</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="185"/>
sor when the Laws of a Commonwealth are abolish'd, the Name also ceases. Whatever is done by force or fraud to set up the Interests and Lusts of one man in opposition to the Laws of his Country, is purely and absolutely Monarchical. Whatsoever past between <HI>Marius, Sylla, Cinna, Catiline, Caesar, Pompey, Crassus, Augustus, Antonius,</HI> and <HI>Lepi∣dus,</HI> is to be imputed to the Contests that arise between Competitors for Monarchy, as well as those that in the next age happen'd between <HI>Galba, Otho, Vitellius,</HI> and <HI>Vespasian:</HI> Or, which is worse, whereas all men in Commonwealths fight for themselves when there is occasion, and if they succeed, enjoy the fruits of their Victory▪ so as even those who remain of the vanquish'd party, partake of the Liberty thereby establish'd, or the good Laws thereupon made; such as follow'd the Ensigns of those men who sought to set up themselves, did, rather like beasts than men, hazard and suffer many unspeakable evils to purchase misery to them∣selves and their Posterity, and to make one their Master, who increasing in Pride, Avarice, and Cruelty, was to be thrown down again with as much Blood as he had bin set up.</P>
<P>These things, if I mistake not, being in the last degree evident, I may leave to our Author all the advantages he can gain by his rhetorical Description of the Tumults of <HI>Rome, when Blood was in the Market-place suckt up with Sponges, and the Jakes stuff'd with Carcases;</HI> to which he may add the crimes of <HI>Sylla</HI>'s Life, and the miserys of his Death: But withal I desire to know what number of Sponges were sufficient to suck up the Blood of five hundred thousand men slain in one day, when the Houses of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jeroboam</HI> contended for the Crown of <HI>Israel,</HI> or of four hundred thousand who fell in one battel between <HI>Joash</HI> and <HI>Amaziah</HI> on the same occasion; what Jakes were capacious enough to contain the Carcases of those that perish'd in the quarrels between the Successors of <HI>Alexander,</HI> the several Competiors for the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; or those which happen'd in <HI>France, Spain, England,</HI> and other places upon the like occasions. If <HI>Sylla</HI> for some time acted as an absolute Monarch, 'tis no wonder that he dy'd like one, or that God punish'd him as <HI>Herod, Philip</HI> the second of <HI>Spain,</HI> and some others, because the hand of his fellow▪Ci∣tizens had unjustly spar'd him. If when he was become detestable to God and Man, he became also miserable, his example ought to deter others srom the Crimes that are aveng'd by a Power which none can es∣cape, and to encourage those who defend, or endeavour to recover their violated Libertys, to act vigorously in a Cause that God dos evidently patronize.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXV. Courts are more subject to Venality and Corruption than Popular Governments.</HEAD>
<P>THO Court-flatterers impute many evils to Popular Governments they no way deserve, I could not think any so impudent as to lay Corruption and Venality to their charge, till I found it in our Author. They might in my opinion have taken those faults upon themselves, since they certainly abound most where Bawds, Whores, Buffoons, Players, Slaves, and other base people who are naturally mercenary, are most

 prevalent. And whosoever would know whether this dos more frequent∣ly befal Commonwealths than Monarchys, especially if they are absolute, need only to inquire whether the <HI>Cornelii, Junii, Fabii, Valerii, Quintii, Curii, Fabritii,</HI> and others who most prevail'd in <HI>Rome</HI> after the expulsion of the Kings, or <HI>Sejanus, Macro, Narcissus, Pallas, Icetus, Tigellinus, Vinnius, Laco, Agrippina, Messalina, Lollia, Poppaea,</HI> and the like, were most subject to those base Vices: Whether it were more easy to corrupt one or two of those Villains and Strumpets, or the Senats and People of <HI>Rome, Carthage, Athens,</HI> and <HI>Sparta;</HI> and whether that sort of Rabble had more power over the Princes they serv'd, than such as most resembled them had whilst the Popular Government continu'd. 'Tis in vain to say those Princes were wicked and vile, for many others are so likewise; and when the Power is in the hands of one man, there can be no assurance he will not be like them. Nay, when the Power is so plac'd, ill men will always find opportunitys of compassing their desires: <HI>Bonus, cautus, opti∣mus Imperator venditur,</HI> said <HI>Dioclesian;</HI> and tho he was no unwise man, yet that which principally induc'd him to renounce the Empire, was the impossibility he found of defending himself against those that were in cre∣dit with him, who daily betray'd and sold him. They see with the eyes of other men, and cannot resist the frauds that are perpetually put upon them. <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> and <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> seem to have bin the best and wisest of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors; but the two <HI>Faustina</HI>'s had such an ascendent over them, as was most shameful to their persons, and mis∣chievous to the Empire and the best men in it. Such as these may gain too much upon the affections of one man in the best regulated Govern∣ment; but that could be of no great danger to the Publick, when many others equal, or not much inferior to him in authority, are ready to oppose whatever he should endeavour to promote by their impulse: but there is no remedy when all depends upon the Will of a single person who is go∣vern'd by them. There was more of acuteness and jest, than of truth in that saying of <HI>Themistocles, That his little boy had more power than any man in</HI> Greece; <HI>for he govern'd his Mother, she him, he</HI> Athens, <HI>and</HI> Athens Greece. For he himself was found to have little power, when for private passions and concernments he departed from the interest of the Publick; and the like has bin found in all places that have bin govern'd in the like manner.</P>
<P>Again; Corruption will always reign most, where those who have the power do most favour it, where the rewards of such Crimes are great∣est, easiest and most valu'd, and where the punishment of them is least sear'd.</P>
<P>1. For the first, we have already prov'd that Liberty cannot be pre∣serv'd, if the manners of the People are corrupted, nor absolute Monar∣chy introduc'd where they are sincere; which is sufficient to shew that those who manage free Governments ought always to the utmost of their power to oppose Corruption, because otherwise both they and their Go∣vernment must inevitably perish; and that on the other hand, the abso∣lute Monarch must endeavour to introduce it, because he cannot subsist without it. 'Tis also so natural for all such Monarchs to place men in power who pretend to love their Persons, and will depend upon their plea∣sure, that possibly 'twould be hard to find one in the world who has not made it the rule of his Government: And this is not only the way to cor∣ruption, but the most dangerous of all. For tho a good man may love a good Monarch, he will obey him only when he commands that which
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
is just; and no one can engage himself blindly to do whatever he is com∣manded, without renouncing all Vertue and Religion; because he knows not whether that which shall be commanded is consistent with either, or directly contrary to the Laws of God and Man. But if such a Monarch be evil, and his Actions such as they are too osten found to be, whoever bears an affection to him, and seconds his designs, declares himself an Enemy to all that is good; and the advancement of such men to power dos not only introduce, foment, and increase Corruption, but fortifys it in such a manner, that without an intire renovation of that State, it can∣not be remov'd. Ill men may possibly creep into any Government; but when the worst are plac'd nearest to the Throne, and rais'd to Honors for being so, they will with that force endeavour to draw all men to a conformity of Spirit with themselves, that it can no otherwise be pre∣vented, than by destroying them and the Principle in which they live.</P>
<P>2. To the second; Man naturally follows that which is good, or seems to him to be so. Hence it is that in well-govern'd States, where a value is put upon Vertue, and no one honor'd unless for such Qualitys as are be∣neficial to the Publick, men are from the tenderest years brought up in a belief, that nothing in this world deserves to be sought after, but such Honors as are acquir'd by vertuous Actions: By this means Vertue it self becomes popular, as in <HI>Sparta, Rome,</HI> and other places, where Riches (which with the Vanity that follows them, and the Honors men give to them, are the root of all evil) were either totally banish'd, or little re∣garded. When no other advantage attended the greatest Riches than the opportunity of living more sumptuously or deliciously, men of great Spirits slighted them. When <HI>Aristippus</HI> told <HI>Cleanthes,</HI> that if he would go to Court and flatter the Tyrant, he need not seek his Supper under a hedg; the Philosopher answer'd, that he who could content himself with such a Supper, neednot go to Court, or flatter the Tyrant. <HI>Epaminondas, Aristides, Phocion,</HI> and even the <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> Kings, found no inconve∣nience in Poverty, whilst their Vertue was honor'd, and the richest Prin∣ces in the world fear'd their Valor and Power. It was not difficult for <HI>Curius, Fabricius, Cincinnatus,</HI> or <HI>Emilius Paulus,</HI> to content themselves with the narrowest Fortune, when it was no obstacle to them in the pur∣suit of those Honors which their Vertues deserv'd. 'Twas in vain to think of bribing a man who sup'd upon the Coleworts of his own Gar∣den. He could not be gain'd by Gold, who did not think it necessary. He that could rise from the Plow to the triumphal Chariot, and conten∣tedly return thither again, could not be corrupted; and he that left the sense of his Poverty to his Executors, who found not wherewith to bury him, might leave <HI>Macedon</HI> and <HI>Greece</HI> to the pillage of his Soldiers, with∣out taking to himself any part of the Booty. But when Luxury was brought into fashion, and they came to be honor'd who liv'd magnificent∣ly, tho they had in themselves no qualitys to distinguish them from the basest of Slaves, the most vertuous men were expos'd to scorn if they were poor: and that poverty which had bin the mother and nurse of their Vertue, grew insupportable. The Poet well understood what effect this change had upon the World, who said,
<Q><L>Nullum crimen abest facinusque libidinis, ex quo</L>
<L>Paupertas Romana perit. <BIBL>Juven.</BIBL></L></Q>
<PB N="182" REF="188"/>
 When Riches grew to be necessary, the desire of them, which is the spring of all mischief, follow'd. They who could not obtain Honors by the noblest Actions, were oblig'd to get Wealth, or purchase them from Whores and Villains, who expos'd them to sale: and when they were once enter'd into this track, they soon learn'd the Vices of those from whom they had receiv'd their Preferment, and to delight in the ways that had brought them to it. When they were come to this, nothing could stop them: All thought and remembrance of good was extinguish'd. They who had bought the Commands of Armys or Provinces, from <HI>Icetus</HI> or <HI>Narcissus,</HI> sought only how to draw Mony from them, to enable them to purchase higher Dignitys, or gain a more assur'd protection from those Patrons. This brought the Government of the World under a most infamous Traf∣fick; and the Treasures arising from it were, for the most part, dissipa∣ted by worse vices, than the Rapine, Violence and Fraud with which they had bin gotten. The Authors of those Crimes had nothing left but their Crimes, and the necessity of committing more, thro the indigence into which they were plung'd by the extravagance of their Expences. These things are inseparable from the life of a Courtier: for as servile Natures are guid∣ed rather by sense than reason, such as addict themselves to the service of Courts, find no other consolation in their misery, than what they receive from sensual pleasures, or such vanitys as they put a value upon; and have no other care, than to get Mony for their supply by begging, stealing, brib∣ing, and other infamous practices. Their Offices are more or less esteem'd according to the opportunitys they afford for the exercise of these Vertues; and no man seeks them for any other end than for gain, nor takes any other way than that which conduces to it. The usual means of attaining them are, by observing the Prince's Humor, flattering his Vices, serving him in his Pleasures, fomenting his Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions, and by advancing his worst Designs, to create an opinion in him that they love his person, and are intirely ad∣dicted to his Will. When Valor, Industry and Wisdom advanc'd men to Offices, it was no easy matter for a man to persuade the Senat he had such Qualitys as were requir'd, if he had them not: But when Princes seek only such as love them, and will do what they command, 'tis easy to impose upon them; and because none that are good will obey them when they command that which is not so, they are always encom∣past by the worst. Those who follow them only for Reward, are most liberal in professing affection to them, and by that means rise to places of Authority and Power. The Fountain being thus corrupted, nothing that is pure can come from it. These mercenary Wretches having the ma∣nagement of Affairs, Justice and Honors are set at a price, and the most lucrative Traffick in the world is thereby establish'd. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Nunc uberiore rapina</L>

Their Riches consisted not os Spoils taken from Enemys, but were the base product of their own corruption. They valu'd nothing but Mony, and
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
those who could bribe them, were sure to be advanc'd to the highest Offices; and whatever they did, fear'd no punishment. Like Effects will ever proceed from the like Causes. When Vanity, Luxury and Prodiga∣lity are in fashion, the desire of Riches must necessarily increase in pro∣portion to them: And when the Power is in the hands of base mercenary persons, they will always (to use the Courtiers phrase) make as much profit of their places as they can. Not only matters of Favor, but of Justice too, will be expos'd to sale; and no way will be open to Honors or Magistracys, but by paying largely for them. He that gets an Office by these means, will not execute it <HI>gratis:</HI> he thinks he may sell what he has bought; and would not have enter'd by corrupt ways, if he had not in∣tended to deal corruptly. Nay, if a well-meaning man should suffer himself to be so far carry'd away by the stream of a prevailing Custom, as to purchase Honors of such Villains, he would be oblig'd to continue in the same course, that he might gain Riches to procure the continuance of his Benefactors protection, or to obtain the favor of such as happen to succeed them: And the corruption thus beginning in the Head, must ne∣cessarily diffuse it self into all the Members of the Commonwealth. Or, if any one (which is not to be expected) after having bin guilty of one Villany, should resolve to commit no more, it could have no other effect than to bring him to ruin; and he being taken away, all things would re∣turn to their former channel.</P>
<P>Besides this, whosoever desires to advance himself, must use such means as are sutable to the time in which he lives, and the humor of the persons with whom he is to deal. It had bin as absurd for any man void of merit to set himself up against <HI>Junius Brutus, Cincinnatus, Papirius Cursor, Camillus, Fabius Maximus,</HI> or <HI>Scipio;</HI> and by bribing the Senat and People of <HI>Rome,</HI> think to be chosen Captain against the <HI>Tarquins, Tuscans, Latins, Samnites, Gauls</HI> or <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> as for the most vertu∣ous men by the most certain proofs of their Wisdom, Experience, Inte∣grity and Valor, to expect advancement from <HI>Caligula, Claudius,</HI> and <HI>Nero,</HI> or the leud Wretches that govern'd them. They hated and fear'd all those that excel'd in Vertue, and setting themselves to destroy the best for being the best, they plac'd the strength of the Government in the hands of the worst, which produc'd the effects beforemention'd. This seems to have bin so well known, that no man pretended to be great at Court, but those who had cast off all thoughts of honor and common honesty: <HI>Revertar cum Leno, Meretrix, Scurra, Cinaedus ero,</HI> said one who saw what manners prevail'd there; and wheresoever they do prevail, such as will rise, must render themselves conformable in all corruption and venality. And it may be observ'd, that a noble Person now living amongst us, who is a great enemy to Bribery, was turn'd out from a con∣siderable Office, as a scandal to the Court; for, said the principal Minister, he will make no profit of his place, and by that means casts a scandal up∣on those that do.</P>
<P>If any man say, this is not generally the fate of all Courts, I confess it; and that if the Prince be just, vertuous, wise, of great Spirit, and not pretending to be absolute, he may chuse such men as are not merce∣nary, or take such a course as may render it hard for them to deserve Bribes, or to preserve themselves from punishment, if they should deflect from his intention. And a Prince of this Age, speaking familiarly with some great Men about him, said, he had heard much of vast Gains made by those who were near to Princes, and ask'd if they made the like? one
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
 of them answer'd, that they were as willing as others to get something, but that no man would give them a farthing; for every one finding a free admittance to his Majesty, no man needed a Sollicitor: And it was no less known that he did of himself grant those things that were just, than that none of them had so much credit as to promote such as were not so. I will not say such a King is a Phenix; perhaps more than one may be found in an Age; but they are certainly rare, and all that is good in their Government proceeding from the excellency of their personal Vertues, it must fail when that Vertue fails which was the root of it. Experience shews how little we can rely upon such a help; for where Crowns are hereditary, Children seldom prove like to their Fathers; and such as are elective have also their defects. Many seem to be modest and innocent in private Fortunes, who prove corrupt and vicious when they are rais'd to Power. The violence, pride and malice of <HI>Saul,</HI> was never discover'd till the People had plac'd him in the Throne. But where the Govern∣ment is Absolute, or the Prince endeavours to make it so, this integrity can never be found: He will always seek such as are content to de∣pend upon his Will, which being always unruly, good men will never comply; ill men will be paid for it, and that opens a gap to all manner of corruption. Something like to this may befal regular Monarchys, or po∣pular Governments. They who are plac'd in the principal Offices of trust, may be treacherous; and when they are so, they will always by these means seek to gain Partizans and Dependents upon themselves. Their designs being corrupt, they must be carry'd on by corruption: But such as would support Monarchy in its regularity, or popular Govern∣ments, must oppose it, or be destroy'd by it. And nothing can better manifest how far Absolute Monarchys are more subject to this venality and corruption than the regular and popular Governments, than that they are rooted in the principle of the one, which cannot subsist without them; and are so contrary to the others, that they must certainly perish unless they defend themselves from them.</P>
<P>If any man be so far of another opinion, as to believe that <HI>Brutus, Camillus, Scipio, Fabius, Hannibal, Pericles, Aristides, Agesilaus, Epami∣nondas</HI> or <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> were as easily corrupted as <HI>Sejanus, Tigellinus, Vinni∣us</HI> or <HI>Laco:</HI> That the Senat and People of <HI>Rome, Carthage, Athens, Sparta</HI> or <HI>Thebes,</HI> were to be bought at as easy rates as one profligate Villain, a Slave, an Eunuch or a Whore; or tho it was not in former Ages, yet it is so now: he may be pleas'd to consider by what means men now rise to places of Judicature, Church-preferment, or any Offices of trust, honor or profit under those Monarchys which we know, that either are or would be absolute. Let him examin how all the Offices of Justice are now dispos'd in <HI>France;</HI> how <HI>Mazarin</HI> came to be advanc'd; what traf∣fick he made of Abbys and Bishopricks, and what treasures he gain'd by that means: Whether the like has not continu'd since his death, and as a laudable Example bin transmitted to us since his Majesty's happy restaura∣tion: Whether Bauds, Whores, Thieves, Buffoons, Parasites, and such vile wretches as are naturally mercenary, have not more Power at <HI>Whitehall, Versailles,</HI> the Vatican, and the Escurial, than in <HI>Venice, Amsterdam,</HI> and <HI>Switzerland:</HI> Whether <HI>H-de, Arl-ngt-n, D-nby,</HI> their Graces of <HI>Cleveland</HI> and <HI>Portsmouth, S-nd-rl-nd, Jenkins</HI> or <HI>Chiffinch,</HI> could probably have attain'd such Power as they have had amongst us, if it had bin dispos'd by the Suffrages of the Parliament and People: Or lastly, Whether such as know only how to work upon the personal Vices of a man, have more
<PB N="185" REF="191"/>
influence upon one who happens to be born in a reigning Family, or upon a Senat consisting of men chosen for their Vertues and Quality, or the whole Body of a Nation.</P>
<P>But if he who possesses or affects an absolute Power be by his interest led to introduce that corruption which the People, Senat, and Magistrats who uphold Popular Governments, abhor, as that which threatens them with destruction: if the example, arts, and means us'd by him and his dependents be of wonderful efficacy towards the introduction of it: if nothing but an admirable Vertue, which can hardly be in one that enjoys or desires such a Power, can divert him from that design; and if such Vertue never did, nor probably ever will continue long in any one Fami∣ly, we cannot rationally believe there ever was a race of men invested with, or possessing such a Power, or that there will ever be any, who have not and will not endeavour to introduce that corruption, which is so necessary for the defence of their Persons, and most important Concern∣ments, and certainly accomplish their great Design, unless they are op∣pos'd or remov'd.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVI. Civil Tumults and Wars are not the greatest Evils that befal Nations.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BƲT skin for skin,</HI> says our Author, <HI>and all that a man has will he give for his life.</HI> And since it was necessary to grace his Book with some Scripture-phrases, none could be fitter for that purpose than those that were spoken by the Devil; but they will be of little use to him: For tho I should so far recede from truth, as to avow those words to be true, I might safely deny the Conclusions he draws from them, <HI>That those are the worst Governments under which most men are slain; or, that more are slain in Popular Governments than in Absolute Monarchys.</HI> For having prov'd that all the Wars and Tumults that have happen'd in Commonwealths, have never produc'd such slaughters as were brought upon the Empires of <HI>Macedon</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> or the Kingdoms of <HI>Israel, Judah, France, Spain, Scotland</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> by Contests between several Competitors for those Crowns; if Tumult, War, and Slaughter, be the point in question, those are the worst of all Governments where they have bin most fre∣quent and cruel. But tho these are terrible Scourges, I deny that Govern∣ment to be simply the worst that has most of them. 'Tis ill that men should kill one another in Seditions, Tumults and Wars; but 'tis worse to bring Nations to such misery, weakness and baseness, as to have nei∣ther strength nor courage to contend for any thing; to have nothing left worth defending, and to give the name of Peace to desolation. I take <HI>Greece</HI> to have bin happy and glorious, when it was full of populous Ci∣tys, flourishing in all the Arts that deserve praise among men: When they were courted and fear'd by the greatest Kings, and never assaulted by any but to his own loss and confusion: When <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Susa</HI> trem∣bled at the motion of their Arms; and their valor exercis'd in these Wars and Tumults, which our Author looks upon as the greatest Evils, was rais'd to such a power that nothing upon Earth was found able to resist them: and I think it now miserable, when Peace reigns within their
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
 empty walls, and the poor remains of those exhausted Nations shel∣tering themselves under the ruins of the desolated Citys, have neither any thing that deserves to be disputed amongst them, nor spirit or force to repel the Injurys they daily suffer from a proud and insupportable Ma∣ster.</P>
<P>The like may be said of <HI>Italy:</HI> Whilst it was inhabited by Nations go∣verning themselves by their own Will, they fell sometimes into domestick Seditions, and had frequent Wars with their Neighbors. When they were free, they lov'd their Country, and were always ready to fight in its defence. Such as succeeded well, increas'd in vigor and power; and even those that were the most unfortunate in one Age, found means to repair their greatest losses if their Government continu'd. Whilst they had a propriety in their goods, they would not suffer the Country to be invaded, since they knew they could have none if it were lost. This gave occasion to Wars and Tumults; but it sharpen'd their Courage, kept up a good Disciplin, and the Nations that were most exercis'd by them, always increas'd in power and number; so that no Country seems ever to have bin of greater strength than <HI>Italy</HI> was when <HI>Hannibal</HI> inva∣ded it: and after his defeat, the rest of the World was not able to refist their Valor and Power. They sometimes kill'd one another; but their Enemys never got any thing but burying-places within their Territorys. All things are now brought into a very different method by the blessed Governments they are under. The fatherly care of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Pope, and other Princes, has establish'd Peace amongst them. We have not in many Ages heard of any Sedition among the <HI>Latins, Sabins, Volsci, Equi, Samnites,</HI> or others. The thin, half-starv'd Inhabitants of Walls supported by Ivy, sear neither popular Tumults, or foreign Alarms; and their sleep is only interrupted by Hunger, the crys of their Children, or the howling of Wolves. Instead of many turbulent, con∣tentious Citys, they have a few scatter'd silent Cottages; and the fierce∣ness of those Nations is so temper'd, that every rascally Collector of Taxes extorts without fear from every man, that which should be the nourishment of his Family. And if any of those Countrys are free from that pernicious Vermin, 'tis thro the extremity of their Poverty. Even in <HI>Rome</HI> a man may be circumvented by the fraud of a Priest, or poison'd by one who would have his Estate, Wife, Whore, or Child; but no∣thing is done that looks like Tumult or Violence. The Governors do as little fear <HI>Gracchus</HI> as <HI>Hannibal;</HI> and instead of wearying their Sub∣jects in Wars, they only seek, by perverted Laws, corrupt Judges, false Witnesses, and vexatious Suits, to cheat them of their Mony and Inheri∣tance. This is the best part of their condition. Where these Arts are us'd, there are men, and they have something to lose; but for the most part the Lands ly wast, and they who were sormerly troubled with the disorders incident to populous Citys, now enjoy the quiet and peaceable estate of a Wilderness.</P>
<P>Again; there is a way of killing worse than that of the Sword: for as <HI>Tertullian</HI> says upon a different occasion, <HI>prohibere nasci est occidere;</HI> those Governments are in the highest degree guilty of Blood, which by taking from men the means of living, bring some to perish thro want, drive others out of the Country, and generally dissuade men from marriage, by taking from them all ways of subsisting their Familys. Notwithstan∣ding all the Seditions of <HI>Florence,</HI> and other Citys of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> the horrid Factions of <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Gibelins, Neri</HI> and <HI>Bianchi,</HI> Nobles and Commons,
<PB N="187" REF="193"/>
they continu'd populous, strong, and exceeding rich; but in the space of less than a hundred and fifty years, the peaceable Reign of the <HI>Medices</HI> is thought to have destroy'd nine parts in ten of the people of that Pro∣vince. Amongst other things 'tis remarkable, that when <HI>Philip</HI> the se∣cond of <HI>Spain</HI> gave <HI>Sienna</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> his Embassador then at <HI>Rome</HI> sent him word, that he had given away more than six hundred and fifty thousand Subjects; and 'tis not believ'd there are now twenty thou∣sand Souls inhabiting that City and Territory. <HI>Pisa, Pistoia, Arezzo, Cor∣tona,</HI> and other Towns that were then good and populous, are in the like proportion diminish'd, and <HI>Florence</HI> more than any. When that City had bin long troubled with Seditions, Tumults, and Wars, for the most part unprosperous, they still retain'd such strength, that when <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth of <HI>France</HI> being admitted as a Friend with his whole Army, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciard.</NOTE>soon after conquer'd the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> thought to master them, the people taking up Arms struck such a terror into him, that he was glad to depart upon such conditions as they thought fit to impose. <HI>Machiavel</HI> reports, that in that time <HI>Florence</HI> alone, with the <HI>Vald' Arno,</HI> a small Ter∣ritory belonging to that City, could, in a few hours, by the sound of a Bell, bring together a hundred and thirty five thousand well arm'd men; where∣as now that City, with all the others in that Province, are brought to such despicable weakness, emptiness, poverty and baseness, that they can nei∣ther resist the oppressions of their own Prince, nor defend him or them∣selves if they were assaulted by a foreign Enemy. The People are dis∣pers'd or destroy'd, and the best Familys sent to seek Habitations in <HI>Ve∣nice, Genoa, Rome,</HI> and <HI>Lucca.</HI> This is not the effect of War or Pestilence; they enjoy a perfect peace, and suffer no other plague than the Govern∣ment they are under. But he who has thus cur'd 'em of Disorders and Tumults, dos, in my opinion, deserve no greater praise than a Physician, who should boast there was not a sick person in a house committed to his care, when he had poison'd all that were in it. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have esta∣blish'd the like peace in the Kingdoms of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> the <HI>West-Indys,</HI> and other places. The <HI>Turks</HI> by the same means prevent Tu∣mults in their Dominions. And they are of such efficacy in all places, that <HI>Mario Chigi,</HI> Brother to Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the seventh, by one sordid cheat upon the sale of Corn, is said within eight years to have destroy'd above a third part of the people in the Ecclesiastical State; and that Coun∣try, which was the strength of the <HI>Romans</HI> in the time of the <HI>Carthagini∣an</HI> Wars, suffer'd more by the covetousness and fraud of that Villain, than by all the defeats receiv'd from <HI>Hannibal.</HI></P>
<P>'Twere an endless work to mention all the places where this peace∣able solitude has bin introduc'd by absolute Monarchy; but Popular and regular Governments have always apply'd themselves to increase the Number, Strength, Power, Riches, and Courage of their People, by providing comfortable ways of subsistence for their own Citizens, invit∣ing Strangers, and filling them all with such a love to their Country, that every man might look upon the publick Cause as his own, and be always ready to defend it. This may sometimes give occasion to Tu∣mults and Wars, as the most vigorous Bodys may fall into Distempers: When every one is solicitous for the Publick, there may be difference of opinion, and some by mistaking the way may bring prejudice when they intend profit: But unless a Tyrant dos arise, and destroy the Government which is the root of their felicity; or they be overwhelm'd by the irresi∣stible power of a Vertue or Fortune greater than their own, they soon re∣cover,
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
 and for the most part rise up in greater Glory and Prosperity than be∣fore. This was seen in the Commonwealths of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> which for this reason were justly called Nurserys of Vertue, and their Magistrats Preservers of men; whereas our Author's peace-making Monarchs can deserve no better title than that of Enemys and Destroyers of Mankind.</P>
<P>I cannot think him in earnest when he exaggerates <HI>Sylla</HI>'s Crueltys, as a proof that the mischiefs suffer'd under free States are more universal than under Kings and Tyrants: For there never was a Tyrant in the World if he was not one; tho thro weariness, infirmity of body, fear, or perhaps the horror of his own wickedness, he at length resign'd his Power; but the evil had taken root so deep, that it could not be remov'd: There was nothing of Liberty remaining in <HI>Rome:</HI> The Laws were overthrown by the violence of the Sword; the remaining Contest was who should be Lord: and there is no reason to believe that if <HI>Pompey</HI> had gain'd the Bat∣tel of <HI>Pharsalia,</HI> he would have made a more modest use of his Victory than <HI>Caesar</HI> did; or that <HI>Rome</HI> would have bin more happy under him than under the other. His Cause was more plausible because the Senat fol∣low'd him, and <HI>Caesar</HI> was the Invader; but he was no better in his per∣son, and his designs seem to have bin the same. He had bin long before <HI>suarum legum auctor &amp; eversor.</HI> He gave the beginning to the first Tri∣umvirat; and 'twere folly to think that he who had bin insolent when he was not come to the highest pitch of Fortune, would have prov'd mode∣rate if success had put all into his hands. The proceedings of <HI>Marius, Cinna, Catiline, Octavius,</HI> and <HI>Antonius</HI> were all of the same nature. No Laws were observ'd: no publick Good intended; the ambition of private persons reign'd; and whatsoever was done by them, or for their interests, can no more be apply'd to Popular, Aristocratical or mix'd Governments, than the furys of <HI>Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXVII. The Mischiefs and Crueltys proceeding from Tyranny, are greater than any that can come from Popular or mix'd Governments.</HEAD>
<P>'TIs now time to examin the reasons of our Author's general Maxims. <HI>The Crueltys,</HI> says he, <HI>of a Tyrant extend ordinarily no farther than some particular men that offend him, and not to the whole Kingdom. It is truly said of his late Majesty King</HI> James, <HI>A King can never be so notoriously vicious, but he will generally favour Justice, and maintain some order. Even cruel</HI> Domitian, Dionysius <HI>the Tyrant, and many others are commended in Historys as great observers of Justice, except in particular cases, wherein his inordinate lusts may carry him away.</HI> It may be said of Popular Govern∣ments, that tho a People thro error do sometimes hurt a private person, and that injury may possibly result to the publick damage, because the man that is offended or destroy'd, might have bin useful to the Society, yet they never do it otherwise than by error: For having the Government in themselves, whatever is prejudicial to it, is so to them; and if they ruin it, they ruin themselves, which no man ever did willingly and knowingly. But in absolute Monarchys the matter is quite otherwise. A Prince that sets up an interest in himself, becomes an Enemy to the Publick: in fol∣lowing his own lusts he offends all, except a few of his corrupt Creatures,

by whose help he oppresses others with a Yoke they are unwilling to bear, and thereby incurs the universal hatred. This hatred is always proporti∣onable to the injurys receiv'd, which being extreme, that must be so too; and every People being powerful in comparison to the Prince that governs, he will always fear those that hate him, and always hate those he fears. When <HI>Luigi Farnese</HI> first Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> had by his Tyranny incens'd the People of that small City, their hatred was not less mortal to him than that of the whole Empire had bin to <HI>Nero;</HI> and as the one burnt <HI>Rome,</HI> the other would have destroy'd <HI>Parma,</HI> if he had not bin prevent∣ed. The like has bin, and will be every where, in as much as every man endeavours to destroy those whom he hates and fears; and the great∣ness of the danger often drives this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuncta serit dum cuncta timet. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></NOTE>fear to rage and madness. For this reason <HI>Caligula</HI> wish'd but one Neck to all the People; and <HI>Nero</HI> tri∣umph'd over the burning City, thinking by that ruin he had prevented his own danger. I know not who the good Authors are that commend <HI>Domitian</HI> for his Justice: but <HI>Tacitus</HI> calls him <HI>Principem virtutibus infe∣stum;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. in Vit.

<P>Many Princes not having in themselves power to destroy their People, have stir'd up foreign Nations against them, and plac'd the only hopes of their safety in the publick Calamity; and lawful Kings when they have fall n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the first degree of madness, so as to assume a power above that which was allow'd by the Law, have in fury prov'd equal to the worst Usurpers. <HI>Cleonymus</HI> of <HI>Sparta</HI> was of this sort: He became, says <HI>Plu∣tarch,</HI> an Enemy to the City, because they would not allow him the abso∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut.

King <HI>John</HI> for the like reasons offer'd the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> to the <HI>Moors,</HI> and to the Pope. <HI>Peter</HI> the Cruel, and other Kings of <HI>Castile</HI> brought vast Armys of <HI>Moors</HI> into <HI>Spain</HI> to the ruin of their own People, who detested their Vices, and would not part with their Privileges. Many other examples of the like nature might be alledg'd; and I wish our own experience did not too well prove that such designs are common. Let him that doubts this examin the Causes of the Wars with <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Years 1639, 1640; the slaughters of the Protestants in <HI>Ireland</HI> 1641; the whole course of Alliances and Treatys for the space of fourscore Years; the friendship contracted with the <HI>French;</HI> frequent Quarrels with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> together with other circumstances that are already made too pub∣lick.

 Commands, insist upon their own Rights, or defend a Religion inconsi∣stent with that which he has espous'd; and then the truth will be so evi∣dent as to require no proof.</P>
<P><HI>Grotius</HI> was never accus'd of dealing hardly with Kings, or laying too much weight upon imaginary cases; nevertheless amongst other reasons that in his opinion justify Subjects in taking arms against their Princes, he <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jur. Bel.</NOTE>alledges this, <HI>propter immanem saevitiam,</HI> and <HI>quando Rex in Populi exitium fertur;</HI> in as much as it is <HI>contrary to, and inconsistent with the ends for which Governments are instituted:</HI> which were most impertinent, if no such thing could be; for that which is not, can have no effect. There are therefore Princes who seek the destruction of their People, or none could be justly oppos'd on that account.</P>
<P>If King <HI>James</HI> was of another opinion, I could wish the course of his Government had bin suted to it. When he said that whilst he had the power of making Judges and Bishops, he would make that to be Law and Gospel which best pleas'd him, and accordingly fill'd those places with such as turn'd both according to his Will and Interests; I must think that by overthrowing Justice, which is the rule of civil and moral Acti∣ons, and perverting the Gospel which is the light of the spiritual man, he left nothing unattempted that he durst attempt, by which he might bring the most extensive and universal evils upon our Nation that any can suffer. This would stand good, tho Princes never err'd, unless they were <HI>transported with some inordinate Lusts;</HI> for 'tis hard to find one that dos not live in the perpetual power of them. They are naturally subject to the impulse of such appetites as well as others; and whatever evil reigns in their Nature is fomented by Education. 'Tis the handle by which their Flatterers lead them; and he that discovers to what Vice a Prince is most inclin'd, is sure to govern him by rendring himself subservient. In this consists the chief art of a Courtier, and by this means it comes to pass that such Lusts as in private men are curb'd by fear, do not only rage as in a wild Beast, but are perpetually inflam'd by the malice of their own Servants: their hatred to the Laws of God or Men that might re∣strain them, increases in proportion with their Vices, or their fears of be∣ing punish'd for them. When they are come to this, they can set no li∣mits to their sury, and there is no extravagance into which they do not fre∣quently fall. But many of 'em do not expect these violent motives: the perversity of their own nature carrys them to the extremitys of evil. They hate Vertue for its own sake, and vertuous men for being most un∣like to themselves. Vertue is the dictate of Reason, or the remains of Divine Light, by which men are made beneficent and beneficial to each other. Religion proceeds from the same spring, and tends to the same end; and the good of Mankind so intirely depends upon these two, that no People ever enjoy'd any thing worth desiring that was not the product of them; and whatsoever any have suffer'd that deserves to be abhor'd and fear'd, has proceeded either from the defect of these, or the wrath of God against them. If any Prince therefore has bin an enemy to Vertue and Religion, he must also have bin an enemy to Mankind, and most especially to the People under him. Whatsoever he dos against those that excel in Vertue and Religion, tends to the destruction of the People who subsist by them. I will not take upon me to define who they are, or to tell the number of those that do this: but 'tis certain there have bin such; and I wish I could say they were few in number, or that they had liv'd only in past ages. <HI>Tacitus</HI> dos not fix this upon one Prince, but
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
upon all that he writes of; and to give his Readers a tast of what he was to write, he says, <HI>that Nobility and Honors were dangerous, but that Vertue</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st. l. 1.</NOTE><HI>brought most certain destruction;</HI> and in another place, that <HI>after the slaugh∣ter of many excellent men,</HI> Nero <HI>resolv'd to cut down Vertue it self, and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Annal. l. 4.</NOTE><HI>therefore kill'd</HI> Thraseas Paetus <HI>and</HI> Bareas Soranus. And whosoever exa∣mins the Christian or Ecclesiastical Historys, will find those Princes to have bin no less enemys to Vertue and Religion than their Predecessors, and consequently enemys to the Nations under them, unless Religion and Vertue be things prejudicial or indifferent to Mankind.</P>
<P>But our Author may say, these were particular cases; and so was the slaughter of the Prophets and Apostles, the crucifixion of Christ, and all the Villanys that have ever bin committed; yet they proceeded from a universal principle of hatred to all that is good, exerting it self as far as it could, to the ruin of mankind: And nothing but the overruling Power of God, who resolv'd to preserve to himself a People, could set bounds to their Rage, which in other respects had as full success as our Author or the Devil could have wish'd.</P>
<P><HI>Dionysius</HI> (his other example of Justice) deserves observation: More falshood, leudness, treachery, ingratitude, cruelty, baseness, avarice, impudence and hatred to all manner of Good, was hardly ever known in in a mortal Creature. For this reason <HI>Diogenes</HI> seeing him at <HI>Corinth,</HI> tho in a poor and contemptible condition, said, he rather deserv'd to have continu'd in the misery, fears and villanys of his Tyranny, than to be suf∣fer'd peaceably to converse with honest men. And if such as these are to be call'd observers of Justice, it must be concluded that the Laws of God and of Men, are either of no value, or contrary to it; and that the destruction of Nations is a better work than their preservation. No Faith is to be observ'd: Temples may be justly sack'd; the best men slain for daring to be better than their Masters; and the whole World, if it were in the power of one Man, rightly torn in pieces and destroy'd.</P>
<P>His Reasons for this are as good as his Doctrin: <HI>It is,</HI> says he, <HI>the mul∣titude of people and abundance of riches, that are the glory and strength of eve∣ry Prince: the bodys of his Subjects do him service in War, and their goods supply his wants. Therefore if not out of affection to his people, yet out of na∣tural love unto himself, every Tyrant desires to preserve the lives and goods of his Subjects.</HI> I should have thought that Princes, tho Tyrants, being God's Vicegerents, and Fathers of their People, would have sought their good, tho no advantage had thereby redounded to themselves, but it seems no such thing is to be expected from them. They consider Nati∣ons, as Grasiers do their Herds and Flocks, according to the profit that can be made of them: and if this be so, a People has no more security under a Prince, than a Herd or Flock under their Master. Tho he de∣sire to be a good Husband, yet they must be deliver'd up to the slaughter when he finds a good Market, or a better way of improving his Land; but they are often foolish, riotous, prodigal, and wantonly destroy their Stock, tho to their own prejudice. We thought that all Princes and Ma∣gistrats had bin set up, that under them we might live quietly and peace∣ably, in all godliness and honesty: but our Author teaches us, that they only seek what they can make of our Bodys and Goods, and that they do not live and reign for us, but for themselves. If this be true, they look upon us not as Children, but as Beasts; nor do us any good for our own sakes, or because it is their duty, but only that we may be useful to them, as Oxen are put into plentiful Pastures that they may be strong for labour,
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
 or fit for slaughter. This is the divine Model of Government that he of∣fers to the World. The just Magistrate is the Minister of God for our good: but this Absolute Monarch has no other care of us, than as our Riches and Multitude may increase his own Glory and Strength. We might easily judg what would be the issue of such a Principle, when the Being of Nations depending upon his will, must also depend upon his opi∣nion whether the Strength, Multitude and Riches of a People do con∣duce to the increase of Glory and Power or not, tho Historys were silent in the case; for these things speak of themselves. The judgment of a single man is not to be rely'd upon; the best and wisest do osten err, the foolish and perverse always; and our discourse is not of what <HI>Moses</HI> or <HI>Samuel</HI> would do, but what may come into the fancy of a furious or wicked man who may usurp the supreme Power, or a child, a woman, or a fool, that may inherit it. Besides, the Proposition upon which he builds his Conclusion, proves often false: for as the Riches, Power, Num∣ber and Courage of our Friends is for our advantage, and that of our Enemys threatens us with ruin; those Princes only can reasonably believe the strength of their Subjects beneficial to them, who govern so as to be assur'd of their Affection, and that their Strength will be imploy'd for them: But those who know they are, or justly deserve to be hated, can∣not but think it will be employ'd against them, and always seek to dimi∣nish that which creates their danger. This must certainly befal as many as are leud, foolish, negligent, imprudent, cowardly, wicked, vicious, or any way unworthy the places they obtain; for their Reign is a perpetu∣al exercise of the most extreme and ruinous Injustice: Every man that follows an honest Interest, is prejudic'd: Every one who finds the Power that was ordain'd for his good, to be turn'd to his hurt, will be angry and hate him that dos it: If the People be of uncorrupted manners, this hatred will be universal, because every one of them desires that which is just; if compos'd of good and evil, the first will always be averse to the evil Government, and the others endeavouring to uphold it, the safe∣ty of the Prince must depend upon the prevalence of either Party. If the best prove to be the strongest, he must perish: and knowing himself to be supported only by the worst, he will always destroy as many of his Enemys as he can; weaken those that remain; enrich his Creatures with their Spoils and Confiscations; by fraud and rapine accumulate Treasures to increase the number of his Party, and advance them into all places of power and trust, that by their assistance he may crush his Adversarys; and every man is accounted his Adversary, who has either Estate, Honor, Vertue or Reputation. This naturally casts all the Power into the hands of those who have no such dangerous qualitys, nor any thing to recom∣mend them, but an absolute resignation of themselves to do whatever they are commanded. These men having neither will nor knowledg to do good, as soon as they come to be in power, Justice is perverted, military Disci∣plin neglected, the publick Treasures exhausted, new Projects invented to raise more; and the Prince's wants daily increasing, thro their igno∣rance, negligence, or deceit, there is no end of their devices and tricks to gain supplys. To this end swarms of Spys, Informers, and false Witnes∣ses are sent out to circumvent the richest and most eminent men: The Tri∣bunals are fill'd with Court-Parasites of profligate Consciences, Fortunes and Reputation, that no man may escape who is brought before them. If Crimes are wanting, the diligence of well▪chosen Officers and Prose∣cutors, with the favor of the Judges, supply all defects; the Law is made a
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
Snare; Vertue suppress'd, Vice fomented, and in a short time Honesty and Knavery, Sobriety and Leudness, Vertue and Vice, become Badges of the several Factions; and every man's conversation and manners shew∣ing to what Party he is addicted, the Prince who makes himself head of the worst, must favour them to the overthrow of the best, which is so streight a way to an universal ruin, that no State can prevent it, unless that course be interrupted.</P>
<P>These things consider'd, no general Judgment can be made of a Magi∣strate's Counsels, from his Name or Duty. He that is just, and become grateful to the People by doing good, will find his own Honor and Secu∣rity in increasing their Number, Riches, Vertue, and Power: If on the other side, by doing evil, he has drawn upon himself the publick hatred, he will always endeavour to take from them the power of doing him any hurt, by bringing them into the utmost weakness, poverty, and baseness. And whoever would know whether any particular Prince desires to in∣crease or destroy the bodys and goods of his Subjects, must examin whe∣ther his Government be such as renders him grateful or odious to them; and whether he dos pursue the publick Interest, or for the advancement of his own Authority set up one in himself contrary to that of his People; which can never befal a Popular Government, and consequently no mischief equal to it can be produc'd by any such, unless something can be imagin'd worse than corruption and destruction.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVIII. Men living under Popular or Mix'd Governments, are more careful of the publick Good, than in Absolute Monarchys.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author delighting in strange things, dos in the next place, with an admirable sagacity, discover two faults in Popular Governments, that were never found by any man before him; and these are no less than Ignorance and Negligence. Speaking of the Care of Princes to preserve their Subjects, he adds; <HI>On the contrary in a Popular State, every man knows the publick Good doth not wholly depend upon his Care, but the Common∣wealth may be well enough govern'd by others, tho he only tend his private busi∣ness.</HI> And a little below, <HI>Nor are they much to be blam'd for their Negli∣gence, since it is an even wager their Ignorance may be as great. The Magi∣strats amongst the people being for the most part annual, do always lay down their Office before they understand it; so as a Prince of a duller understanding must needs excel them.</HI> This is bravely determin'd, and the world is be∣holden to <HI>Filmer</HI> for the discovery of the Errors that have hitherto bin Epidemical. Most men had believ'd, that such as live in Free States, are usually pleas'd with their condition, desire to maintain it; and every man finding his own good comprehended in the Publick, as those that sail in the same Ship, employs the Talent he has in endeavouring to preserve it, knowing that he must perish if that miscarry. This was an incou∣ragement to Industry; and the continual Labors and Dangers to which the <HI>Romans</HI> and other free Nations expos'd themselves, have bin taken for Testimonys that they thought themselves concern'd in the businesses that past among them, and that every one did not neglect them thro an opinion that they would be done well enough by others. It was also thought
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
 that free Citys, by frequent Elections of Magistrats, became Nurserys of great and able Men, every man endeavouring to excel others, that he might be advanc'd to the Honor he had no other title to than what might arise from his Merit or Reputation; in which they succeeded so well, that one of them may be justly said to have produc'd more eminent Men, than all the Absolute Monarchys that have bin in the World. But these were mistakes. Perhaps <HI>Brutus, Valerius,</HI> and other <HI>Roman</HI> Senators or Magistrats, for the space of three hundred years, might have taken some care of the Commonwealth, if they had thought it wholly depended upon one of them: But believing it would be well enough govern'd by others, they neglected it. <HI>Camillus, Cincinnatus, Papirius, Fabius, Rullus</HI> and <HI>Maximus, Scipio Africanus, Amilcar, Hannibal, Pericles, Themistocles, Alcibiades, Epaminondas, Philopemen,</HI> and others, might have prov'd able Men in affairs of War or Government; but they were remov'd from their Offices before they understood them, and must needs be excel'd in both by Princes, tho of duller understanding. This may be enough to excuse them for performing their Duty so slackly and meanly: But 'tis strange that <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and others, should so far overlook the Reason, and so grosly mistake the matter of Fact, as not only to say, that great and excellent Spirits fail'd when Liberty was lost, and all Preferments given to those who were most propense to Slavery; but that there wanted men <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. Annal. l. 1.</NOTE>even to write the History, <HI>Inscitia Reipublicae ut alienae.</HI> They never ap∣ply'd themselves to understand Affairs depending upon the will of one man, in whom they were no otherwise concern'd, than to avoid the ef∣fects of his Rage; and that was chiefly to be done, by not falling under the suspicion of being vertuous. This was the study then in request; and the most cunning in this Art were call'd <HI>Scientes temporum:</HI> No other wisdom was esteem'd in that and the ensuing Ages, and no more was re∣quir'd, since the Paternal Care, deep Wisdom, and profound Judgment of the Princes provided for all; and tho they were of duller understand∣ings, they must needs excel other Magistrats, who having bin created only for a year, left their Offices before they could understand the Dutys of them. This was evidenc'd by that tenderness and sincerity of heart, as well as the great purity of manners observ'd in <HI>Tiberius;</HI> the Clemen∣cy, Justice, solid Judgment and Frugality of <HI>Caligula;</HI> the Industry, Courage and Sobriety of <HI>Claudius;</HI> the good Nature and prudent Go∣vernment of <HI>Nero;</HI> the Temperance, Vivacity and Diligence of <HI>Vitellius;</HI> the Liberality of <HI>Galba</HI> and <HI>Vespasian;</HI> together with the Encouragement given by <HI>Domitian, Commodus, Heliogabalus,</HI> and many others, to all manner of Vertues, and Favors confer'd upon those that excel'd in them. Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Author giving such infallible proof of his Integrity and Understand∣ing, by teaching us these things that would never have come into our heads, ought surely to be credited, tho that which he proposes seems to be most absurd. But if we believe such as liv'd in those times, or those who in later ages have perus'd their Writings, we cannot but think the Princes beforemention'd, and the greatest part of those who possest the same places, not only to have bin void of all Vertue, and to have suffer'd none to grow up under them, but in baseness, sottishness and malice, to have bin equal to the worst of all Beasts. Whilst one Prince polluted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust and Blood, sat in his <HI>Grotto</HI> at <HI>Capreae,</HI> surrounded with an in∣famous Troop of Astrologers, and others were govern'd by Whores, Bardache's, manumis'd Slaves, and other Villains, the Empire was ru∣in'd thro their negligence, incapacity and wickedness; and the City that
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
had flourish'd in all manner of Vertue, as much or more than any that has bin yet known in the world, produc'd no more; the Disciplin was dissolv'd that nourish'd it; no man could hope to advance a publick Good, or obviate an Evil by his diligence and valor; and he who acquir'd repu∣tation by either, could expect no other reward than a cruel death. If <HI>Germanicus</HI> and <HI>Corbulo,</HI> who were born when Liberty was expiring, be brought for Examples against the first part of my Assertion, their ends will justify the latter; and no eminent <HI>Roman</HI> Family is known to have brought forth a man that deserv'd to be nam'd in History since their time. This is as probable in reason, as true in fact. Men are valiant and indu∣strious, when they fight for themselves and their Country; they prove excellent in all the Arts of War and Peace, when they are bred up in ver∣tuous Exercises, and taught by their Fathers and Masters to rejoice in the Honors gain'd by them: they love their Country, when the good of every particular man is comprehended in the publick Prosperity, and the success of their Atchievements is improv'd to the general advantage: They undertake hazards and labors for the Government, when 'tis just∣ly administer'd; when Innocence is safe, and Vertue honour'd; when no man is distinguish'd from the vulgar, but such as have distinguish'd themselves by the bravery of their actions; when no honor is thought too great for those who do it eminently, unless it be such as cannot be communicated to others of equal merit: They do not spare their Persons, Purses, or Friends, when the publick Powers are employ'd for the pub∣lick Benefit, and imprint the like affections in their Children from their Infancy. The disciplin of Obedience in which the <HI>Romans</HI> were bred, taught them to command: and few were admitted to the Magistracys of inferior rank, till they had given such proof of their Vertue as might de∣serve the Supreme. <HI>Cincinnatus, Camillus, Papirius, Mamercus, Fabius Maximus,</HI> were not made Dictators, that they might learn the Dutys of the Office; but because they were judg'd to be of such Wisdom, Valor, Integrity and Experience, that they might be safely trusted with the highest Powers; and whilst the Law reign'd, not one was advanc'd to that honor, who did not fully answer what was expected from him. By this means the City was so replenish'd with men fit for the greatest employ∣ments, that even in its infancy, when three hundred and six of the <HI>Fabii, Quorum neminem,</HI> says <HI>Livy, ducem sperneret quibuslibet temporibus Senatus,</HI> were kill'd in one day, the City did lament the loss, but was not so weak∣en'd to give any advantage to their Enemys: and when every one of those who had bin eminent before the second Punic War, <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> on∣ly excepted, had perish'd in it, others arose in their places, who sur∣past them in number, and were equal to them in Vertue. The City was a perpetual spring of such men as long as Liberty lasted; but that was no sooner overthrown, than Vertue was torn up by the roots; the People became base and sordid, the small remains of the Nobility slothsul and effeminate; and their <HI>Italian</HI> Associats becoming like to them, the Empire whilst it stood, was only sustain'd by the strength os Foreigners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grecian</HI> Vertue had the same fate, and expir'd with Liberty: in∣stead of such Soldiers as in their time had no equals, and such Generals of Armys and Fleets, Legislators and Governors, as all succeeding Ages have justly admir'd, they sent out swarms of Fidlers, Jesters, Chariot-drivers, Players, Bawds, Flatterers, Ministers of the most impure Lusts; or idle, babling, hypocritical Philosophers, not much better than they. The Emperors Courts were always crouded with this Vermin; and not∣withstanding
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>
 the necessity our Author imagins that Princes must needs understand matters of Government better than Magistrats annually cho∣sen, they did for the most part prove so brutish as to give themselves and the World to be govern'd by such as these, and that without any great prejudice, since none could be found more ignorant, leud, and base than themselves.</P>
<P>'Tis absurd to impute this to the change of times; for time changes no∣thing; and nothing was chang'd in those times but the Government, and that chang'd all things. This is not accidental, but according to the rules given to Nature by God, imposing upon all things a necessity of perpetu∣ally following their Causes. Fruits are always of the same nature with the Seeds and Roots from which they come, and Trees are known by the fruits they bear: As a Man begets a Man, and a Beast a Beast; that Society of Men which constitutes a Government upon the foundation of Justice, Vertue, and the common Good, will always have men to pro∣mote those ends; and that which intends the advancement of one man's desires and vanity, will abound in those that will foment them. Men follow that which seems advantageous to themselves. Such as are bred under a good disciplin, and see that all benefits procur'd to their Country by vertuous Actions, redound to the honor and advantage of themselves, their Children, Friends, and Relations, contract from their infancy a love to the Publick, and look upon the common Concernments as their own. When they have learnt to be vertuous, and see that Vertue is in esteem, they seek no other preferments than such as may be obtain'd that way; and no Country ever wanted great numbers of excellent men, where this method was establish'd. On the other side, when 'tis evident that the best are despis'd, hated, or mark'd out for destruction; all things calculated to the humor or advantage of one man, who is often the worst, or govern'd by the worst; Honors, Riches, Commands, and Dignitys dispos'd by his Will, and his favor gain'd only by a most obsequious re∣spect, or a pretended affection to his person, together with a servile obe∣dience to his commands, all Applications to vertuous Actions will cease; and no man caring to render himself or his Children worthy of great Im∣ployments, such as desire to have them will, by little intrigues, corrup∣tion, scurrility and flattery, endeavour to make way to them; by which means true Merit in a short time comes to be abolish'd, as fell out in <HI>Rome</HI> as soon as the <HI>Caesars</HI> began to reign.</P>
<P>He who dos not believe this, may see whether the like did not happen in all the other Commonwealths of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Greece;</HI> or if modern exam∣ples are thought to be of more value, let him examin whether the No∣blemen of <HI>Venice,</HI> who are born and bred in Familys that never knew a Master; who act for themselves, and have a part in all the good or evil that befals the Commonwealth, and know that if it be destroy'd, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must perish, or at least that all changes are to their prejudice, do neglect the publick Interests, as thinking that the whole not depending upon any one of them, things will be well enough govern'd, tho they attend only their private benefit. Let it be observ'd whether they do better under∣stand the common concernments, than the great men of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> who never come to the knowledg of any thing, unless they happen to be favor'd by the King or his Ministers, and know themselves never to be more miserable than when their Master is most prosperous. For my own part, I cannot think it necessary to alledg any other proo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this point, than that when <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperor, <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth of
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
<HI>France,</HI> the fierce Pope <HI>Julius</HI> the second, and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the subtil and powerful King of <HI>Spain,</HI> had by the League of <HI>Cambray</HI> combin'd against the <HI>Venetians,</HI> gain'd the Battel of <HI>La Ghirad'adda,</HI> taken <HI>Alviano</HI> their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Paol. Paruta Hist. Venet. Guicciard.</NOTE>General prisoner, depriv'd them of all their Dominion on the <HI>Terra firma,</HI> and prepar'd to assault the City, it was, under God, solely preserv'd by the vigor and wisdom of their Nobility, who tho no way educated to War, unless by Sea, sparing neither persons nor purses, did with admirable in∣dustry and courage first recover <HI>Padoüa,</HI> and then many other Citys, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o as at the end of that terrible War they came off without any diminution of their Territorys. Whereas <HI>Portugal</HI> having in our age revolted from the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> no one doubts that it had bin immediately reduc'd, if the great men of <HI>Spain</HI> had not bin pleas'd with such a lessening of their Master's power, and resolv'd not to repair it by the recovery of that Kingdom, or to deprive themselves of an easy retreat when they should be opprest by him or his Favorites. The like thought was more plainly exprest by the Mareschal <HI>de Bassompierre,</HI> who seeing how hardly <HI>Rochel</HI> was prest by <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th,</HI> said, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Je croy qu'enfin Nous serons assez fous pour prendre la Rochelle. Mem. de Bassom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ierre.</NOTE><HI>he thought they should be such fools to take it:</HI> but 'tis believ'd they would never have bin such fools; and the treachery only of our Countrymen did enable the Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> to do it (as for his own Glory, and the advancement of the Popish Cause he really intended) and nothing is to this day more common in the mouths of their wisest and best men, tho Papists, than the acknowledgment of their own folly in suffering that place to fall, the King having by that means gotten power to proceed against them at his pleasure. The brave Mon∣sieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> is said to have carry'd this to a greater height in his last Discourse to the present King of <HI>France:</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You think, said he, you have Armys, but you have none; the one half of the Officers are the Baw∣dy-house Companions of Monsieur <HI>de xxx,</HI> or the Creatures of his Whore Madam <HI>de xxx:</HI> the other half may be men of experience, and fit for their Imployments; but they are such as would be pleas'd with nothing more than to see you lose two or three Battels, that com∣ing to stand in need of them, you might cause them to be better us'd by your Ministers than of late they have bin."</Q> It may easily be ima∣gin'd how men in such sentiments do serve their Master; and nothing is more evident than that the <HI>French</HI> in this age have had so great advanta∣ges, that they might have brought <HI>Europe,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Asia,</HI> under their power, if the interest of the Nation had bin united to that of the Go∣vernment, and the Strength, Vigor, and Bravery of the Nobility em∣ploy'd that way. But since it has pleas'd God to suffer us to fall into a condition of being little able to help our selves, and that they are in so good terms with the <HI>Turk</HI> as not to attack him, 'tis our happiness that they do not know their own strength, or cannot without ruin to themselves turn it to our prejudice.</P>
<P>I could give yet more pregnant testimonys of the difference between men fighting for their own interests in the Offices to which they had bin advanc'd by the votes of numerous Assemblys, and such as serve for pay, and get preferments by corruption or favor, if I were not unwilling to stir the spleen of some men, by obliging them to reflect upon what has past in our own Age and Country; to compare the Justice of our Tribunals within the time of our memory, and the integrity of those who for a while manag'd the publick Treasure; the Disciplin, Valor and Strength
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
 of our Armys and Fleets; the increase of our Riches and Trade; the success of our Wars in <HI>Scotland, Ireland,</HI> and at Sea; the glory and reputation not long since gain'd, with that condition into which we are of late fallen. But I think, I shall offend no wise or good man, if I say, that as neither the <HI>Romans</HI> nor <HI>Grecians</HI> in the time of their Liberty ever perform'd any actions more glorious than freeing the Country from a Civil War that had rag'd in every part, the conquest of two such Kingdoms as <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and crushing the formidable power of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> by Sea; nor ever produc'd more examples of Valor, Industry, Integrity, and in all respects compleat, disinterested, unmoveable and incorruptible Ver∣tue than were at that time seen in our Nation: So neither of them upon the change of their Affairs did exceed us in weakness, cowardice, base∣ness, venality, leudness, and all manner of corruption. We have reason therefore not only to believe that all Princes do not necessarily understand the affairs of their People, or provide better for them than those who are otherwise chosen; but that as there is nothing of Greatness, Power, Riches, Strength, and Happiness, which we might not reasonably have hop'd for if we had rightly improv'd the advantages we had; so there is nothing of shame and misery which we may not justly fear, since we have neglected them.</P>
<P>If any man think that this evil of advancing Officers for personal re∣spects, favor or corruption, is not of great extent, I desire him to consi∣der, that the Officers of State, Courts of Justice, Church, Armys, Fleets and Corporations, are of such number and power as wholly to corrupt a Nation when they themselves are corrupted; and will ever be corrupt, when they attain to their Offices by corruption. The good management of all Affairs, Civil, Military, and Ecclesiastical, necessari∣ly depends upon good order and disciplin; and 'tis not in the power of common men to reform abuses patroniz'd by those in Authority, nor to prevent the mischiefs thereupon ensuing; and not having power to direct publick actions to the publick good, they must consequently want the industry and affection that is requir'd to bring them to a good issue. The <HI>Romans</HI> were easily beaten under the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> tho immediately before the erection, and after the extinction of that Power, none of their Neighbours were able to resist them. The <HI>Goths,</HI> who with much Glory had reign'd in <HI>Spain</HI> for about three hundred years, had neither strength nor courage under their leud and odious King <HI>Rodrigo,</HI> and were in one day subdu'd with little loss of blood by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and could not in less than eight hundred years free their Country from them. That brave Nation having of late fallen under as base a conduct, has now as little heart or power to defend it self: Court-Parasites have render'd Valor ridiculous; and they who have ever shew'd themselves as much inclin'd to Arms as any people of the world, do now abhor them, and are sent to the Wars by force, laid in Carts, bound like Calves brought to the Shambles, and left to starve in <HI>Flanders</HI> as soon as they arrive. It may easily be judg'd what service can be expected from such men, tho they should happen to be well commanded: but the great Officers, by the corruption of the Court, think only of enriching themselves; and encreasing the misery of the Soldiers by their frauds, both become equally useless to the State.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the seeming prosperity of <HI>France,</HI> matters there are not much better manag'd. The warlike temper of that people is so worn out by the frauds and crueltys of corrupt Officers, that few men list them∣selves willingly to be Soldiers; and when they are engag'd or forc'd, they
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
are so little able to endure the miserys to which they are expos'd, that they daily run away from their Colors, tho they know not whither to go, and expect no mercy if they are taken. The King has in vain at∣tempted to correct this humor by the severity of martial Law; but mens minds will not be forc'd; and tho his Troops are perfectly well arm'd, cloth'd, and exercis'd, they have given many testimonys of little worth. When the Prince of <HI>Condé</HI> had by his own Valor, and the Strength of the King's Guards, broken the first line of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army at the battel of <HI>Seneff,</HI> he could not make the second and third line of his own Army to advance and reinforce the first, by which means he lost all the fair hopes he had conceiv'd of an intire Victory. Not long after, the Mareschal <HI>de Crequi</HI> was abandon'd by his whole Army near <HI>Trier,</HI> who ran away, hardly striking a stroke, and left him with sixteen horse to shift for himself. When <HI>Monsieur de Turenne,</HI> by the excellency of his Conduct and Valor, had gain'd such a Reputation amongst the Soldiers, that they thought themselves secure under him, he did not suffer such disgraces; but he being kill'd, they return'd to the usual temper of forc'd and ill-us'd Soldiers: half the Army was lost in a retreat, little differing from a flight; and the rest, as they themselves confess, sav'd by the bra∣very of two <HI>English</HI> Regiments. The Prince of <HI>Condé</HI> was soon after sent to command; but he could not with all his courage, skill and repu∣tation, raise their fallen Spirits, nor preserve his Army any other way, than by lodging them in a Camp near <HI>Schlestadt,</HI> so fortify'd by Art and Nature that it could not be forc'd.</P>
<P>To these we may add some Examples of our own. In our late War the <HI>Scots</HI> Foot, whether Friends or Enemys, were much inferior to those of the Parliament, and their Horse esteem'd as nothing. Yet in the year 1639 and 1640, the King's Army, tho very numerous, excellently arm'd and mounted, and in appearance able to conquer many such King∣doms as <HI>Scotland,</HI> being under the conduct of Courtiers, and affected as men usually are towards those that use them ill, and seek to destroy them, they could never resist a wretched Army commanded by <HI>Leven;</HI> but were shamefully beaten at <HI>Newborn,</HI> and left the Northern Countys to be ravag'd by them.</P>
<P>When <HI>Van Tromp</HI> set upon <HI>Blake</HI> in <HI>Foleston-Bay,</HI> the Parliament had not above thirteen Ships against threescore, and not a man that had ever seen any other fight at Sea, than between a Merchant-ship and a Pirat, to op∣pose the best Captain in the world, attended with many others in valor and experience not much inserior to him. Many other difficultys were observ'd in the unsetled State: Few Ships, want of Mony, several Fa∣ctions, and some who to advance particular Interests betray'd the Publick. But such was the power of Wisdom and Integrity in those that sat at the Helm, and their diligence in chusing men only for their Merit, was blest with such success, that in two years our Fleets grew to be as famous as our Land Armys; the Reputation and Power of our Nation rose to a grea∣ter height, than when we possest the better half of <HI>France,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were our Prisoners. All the States, Kings and Potentates of <HI>Europe,</HI> most respectfully, not to say submissively, sought our Friendship; and <HI>Rome</HI> was more afraid of <HI>Blake</HI> and his Fleet, than they had bin of the great King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> when he was ready to invade <HI>Italy</HI> with a hundred thousand men. This was the work of those, who, if our Author says true, <HI>thought basely of the publick Concernments;</HI> and believing things might be well enough manag'd by others, minded only
<PB N="200" REF="206"/>
 their private Affairs. These were the effects of the negligence and igno∣rance of those, who being suddenly advanc'd to Offices, were remov'd before they understood the Dutys of them. These Diseases, which pro∣ceed from popular corruption and irregularity, were certainly cur'd by the restitution of that Integrity, good Order and Stability that accompany divine Monarchy. The Justice of the War made against <HI>Holland</HI> in the year 1665; the probity of the Gentleman, who without partiality or bribery, chose the most part of the Officers that carry'd it on; the Wis∣dom, Diligence and Valor manifested in the conduct, and the Glory with which it was ended, justifys all that our Author can say in its commenda∣tion. If any doubt remains, the subtilty of making the King of <HI>France</HI> desire that the <HI>Netherlands</HI> might be an accession to his Crown; the inge∣nious ways taken by us to facilitate the conquest of them; the Industry of our Embassadors in diverting the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from entring into the War till it was too late to recover the Losses sustain'd; the honourable Design upon the <HI>Smyrna</HI> Fleet, and our frankness in taking the quarrel upon our selves, together with the important Figure we now make in <HI>Europe,</HI> may wholly remove it; and in confirmation of our Author's Doctrin, shew, that Princes do better perform the Offices that require Wisdom, Industry and Valor, than annual Magistrats; and do more seldom err in the choice of Officers, than Senats and popular Assemblys.</P>

<DIV3 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXIX. There is no assurance that the Distempers of a State shall be cur'd by the Wisdom of a Prince.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BƲT,</HI> says our Author, <HI>the Vertue and Wisdom of a Prince supplys all. Tho he were of a duller understanding, by use and experience he must needs excel all:</HI> Nature, Age, or Sex, are, as it seems, nothing to the case. A Child as soon as he comes to be a King, has experience; the head of a Fool is fill'd with Wisdom, as soon as a Crown is set upon it, and the most vicious do in a moment become vertuous. This is more strange than that an Ass being train'd to a Course, should outrun the best <HI>Arabian</HI> Horse; or a Hare bred up in an Army, become more strong and fierce than a Lion: for Fortune dos not only supply all natural defects in Princes, and correct their vices, but gives them the benefit of use and experience when they have none. Some Reasons and Examples might have bin expected to prove this extraordinary Proposition: But according to his laudable custom, he is pleas'd to trouble himself with neither; and thinks that the impudence of an Assertion is sufficient to make that to pass, which is repugnant to experience and common sense, as may appear by the following discourse.</P>
<P>I will not insist upon terms; for tho <HI>duller understanding</HI> signisys no∣thing, in as much as no understanding is dull, and a man is said to be dull only because he wants it; but presuming he means little understanding, I shall so take it. This defect may possibly be repair'd in time; but to conclude it must be so, is absurd, for no one has this use and experience when he begins to reign. At that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime many Errors may be committed to the ruin of himself or people, and many have perish'd even in their be∣ginning. <HI>Edward</HI> the fifth and sixth of <HI>England, Francis</HI> the second of
<PB N="201" REF="207"/>
<HI>France,</HI> and divers other Kings have dy'd in the beginning of their youth: <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth liv'd only to add the furys of youth to the follys of his childhood; and our <HI>Henry</HI> the second, <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, seem to have bin little wiser in the last, than in the first year of their Reign or Life. The present Kings of <HI>Spain, France,</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> came to the Crowns they wear before the sixth year of their Age; and if they did then surpass all annual Magistrats in Wis∣dom and Valor, it was by a peculiar Gift of God, which, for any thing we know, is not given to every King, and it was not Use and Experi∣ence that made them to excel. If it be pretended that this Experience, with the Wisdom that it gives, comes in time and by degrees; I may modestly ask, what time is requir'd to render a Prince excellent in Wis∣dom who is a Child or a Fool? and who will give security that he shall live to that time, or that the Kingdom shall not be ruin'd in the time of his folly? I may also doubt how our Author, who concludes that every King in time must needs become excellent in Wisdom, can be reconcil'd to <HI>Solomon,</HI> who in preferring a wise Child before an old and foolish King that will not be advis'd, shews that an old King may be a Fool, and he that will not be advis'd is one. Some are so naturally brutish and stupid, that neither education nor time will mend them. 'Tis probable that <HI>Solomon</HI> took what care he could to instruct his only Son <HI>Rehoboam;</HI> but he was certainly a Fool at forty years of age, and we have no reason to believe that he deserv'd a better name. He seems to have bin the very Fool his Father intended, who tho bray'd in a mortar would never leave his folly: He would not be advis'd, tho the hand of God was against him; ten Tribes revolted from him, and the City and Temple was pil∣lag'd by the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> Neither experience nor afflictions could mend him, and he is call'd to this day by his own Countrymen <HI>Stultitia Gen∣tium.</HI> I might offend tender ears, if I should alledg all the Examples of Princes mention'd in History, or known in our own Age, who have liv'd and dy'd as foolish and incorrigible as he: but no man, I presume, will be scandaliz'd if I say, that the ten last Kings of <HI>Meroveus</HI> his Race, whom the <HI>French</HI> Historians call <HI>Les Roys faineants,</HI> were so far from ex∣celling other men in understanding, that they liv'd and dy'd more like beasts than men. Nay, the Wisdom and Valor of <HI>Charles Martel</HI> ex∣pir'd in his Grandchild <HI>Charles</HI> the Great; and his Posterity grew to be so sottish, that the <HI>French</HI> Nation must have perish'd under their conduct, if the Nobility and People had not rejected them, and plac'd the Crown upon a more deserving Head.</P>
<P>This is as much as is necessary to be said to the general Proposition; for it is false, if it be not always true; and no conclusion can be made upon it. But I need not be so strict with our Author, there being no one fou d part in his Assertion. Many Children come to be Kings when they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e no experience; and die, or are depos'd, before they can gain any. Many are by nature so sottish that they can learn nothing: Others fal∣ling under the power of Women, or corrupt Favorites and Ministers, are persuaded and seduc'd from the good ways to which their own natural un∣derstanding or experience might lead them; the Evils drawn upon them∣selves or their Subjects, by the Errors committed in the time of their ig∣norance, are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten grievous, and sometimes irreparable, tho they should be made wise by time and experience. A person of royal Birth and ex∣cellent Wit, was so sensible of this as to tell me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the condition of Kings was most miserable, in as much as they never heard Truth till
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
 they were ruin'd by Lies; and then every one was ready to tell it to them, not by way of advice, but reproach, and rather to vent their own spite, than to seek a remedy to the evils brought upon them and the people."</Q> Others attain to Crowns when they are of full Age, and have experience as Men, tho none as Kings; and therefore are apt to commit as great mistakes as Children: And upon the whole matter all the Historys of the world shew, that instead of this profound Judgment and incomparable Wisdom which our Author generally attributes to all Kings, there is no sort of men that do more frequently and intirely want it.</P>
<P>But tho Kings were always wise by nature, or made to be so by expe∣rience, it would be of little advantage to Nations under them, unless their Wisdom were pure, perfect, and acompany'd with Clemency, Magna∣nimity, Justice, Valor and Piety. Our Author himself durst hardly have said, that these Vertues or Graces are gain'd by Experience, or annex'd by God to any rank of Men or Familys. He gives them where he plea∣ses without distinction. We sometimes see those upon Thrones, who by God and Nature seem to have bin design'd for the most sordid Offices; and those have bin known to pass their lives in meanness and poverty, who had all the Qualitys that could be desir'd in Princes. There is like∣wise a kind of ability to dispatch some sort of Affairs, that Princes who continue long in a Throne may to a degree acquire or increase: Some men take this for Wisdom, but K <HI>James</HI> more rightly call'd it by the name of <HI>Kingcraft;</HI> and as it principally consists in Dissimulation, and the arts of working upon mens Passions, Vanitys, private Interests or Vices, to make them for the most part instruments of Mischief, it has the advance∣ment or security of their own Persons for its object, is frequently exercis'd with all the excesses of Pride, Avarice, Treachery and Cruelty; and no men have bin ever found more notoriously to deflect from all that deserves praise in a Prince, or a Gentleman, than those that have most excel'd in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. An. l. 11, 12.</NOTE>it. <HI>Pharasmenes</HI> King of <HI>Iberia,</HI> is recorded by <HI>Tacitus</HI> to have bin well vers'd in this Science. His Brother <HI>Mithradates</HI> King of <HI>Armenia</HI> had marry'd his Daughter, and given his own Daughter to <HI>Rhadamistus</HI> Son of <HI>Pharasmenes.</HI> He had some Contests with <HI>Mithradates,</HI> but by the help of these mutual Alliances, nearness of Blood, the diligence of <HI>Rhada∣mistus,</HI> and an Oath, strengthen'd with all the Ceremonys that amongst those Nations were esteem'd most sacred, not to use Arms or Poison against him, all was compos'd; and by this means getting him into his power, he stifled him with a great weight of clothes thrown upon him, kill'd his Children, and not long after his own Son <HI>Rhadamistus</HI> also. <HI>Louis</HI> the eleventh of <HI>France, James</HI> the third of <HI>Scotland, Henry</HI> the se∣venth of <HI>England,</HI> were great Masters of these Arts; and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose who are acquainted with History, will easily judg how happy Nations would be if all Kings did in time certainly learn them.</P>
<P>Our Author, as a farther testimony of his Judgment, having said that Kings must needs excel others in Understanding, and grounded his Do∣ctrin upon their profound Wisdom, imputes to them those <HI>base and panick sears</HI> which are inconsistent with it, or any royal Vertue: and to carry the point higher, tells us, <HI>There is no Tyrant so barbarously wicked, but his own reason and sense will tell him, that tho he be a God, yet he must die like a Man; and that there is not the meanest of his Subjects, but may find a means to revenge himself of the Injurys offer'd him:</HI> and from thence concludes, that <HI>there is no such Tyranny as that of a Multitude which is subject to no</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="209"/>
<HI>sach fears.</HI> But if there be such a thing in the World, as a barbarous and wicked Tyrant, he is something different from a King, or the same; and his Wisdom is consistent or inconsistent with Barbarity, Wickedness, and Tyranny. If there be no difference, the praises he gives, and the rights he ascribes to the one belong also to the other: and the excellency of Wisdom may consist with Barbarity, Wickedness, Tyranny, and the panick fears that accompany them; which hitherto have bin thought to comprehend the utmost excesses of Folly and Madness; and I know no better testimony of the truth of that Opinion, than that Wisdom always distinguishing good from evil, and being seen only in the rectitude of that distinction, in following and adhering to the good, rejecting that which is evil, preferring safety before danger, happiness before misery, and in knowing rightly how to use the means of attaining or preserving the one, and preventing or avoiding the other, there cannot be a more extravagant deviation from Reason, than for a man, who in a private condition might live safely and happily, to invade a Principality: or if he be a Prince, who by governing with Justice and Clemency might obtain the inward satisfaction of his own Mind, hope for the blessing of God upon his just and vertuous Actions, acquire the love and praises of men, and live in safety and happiness amongst his safe and happy Subjects, to fall into that Barbarity, Wickedness, and Tyranny, which brings upon him the dis∣pleasure of God, and detestation of men, and which is always attended with those base and panick fears, that comprehend all that is shameful and miserable. This being perceiv'd by <HI>Machiavel,</HI> he could not think <NOTE PLACE="marg">Discors. sopra T. Liv. l. 1. c. 10.</NOTE>that any man in his senses would not rather be a <HI>Scipio</HI> than a <HI>Cesar;</HI> or if he came to be a Prince, would not rather chuse to imitate <HI>Agesilaus, Ti∣moleon,</HI> or <HI>Dion,</HI> than <HI>Nabis, Phalaris,</HI> or <HI>Dionysius;</HI> and imputes the contrary choice to madness. Nevertheless 'tis too well known that ma∣ny of our Author's profound wise men in the depth of their Judgment, made perfect by use and experience, have fallen into it.</P>
<P>If there be a difference between this barbarous wicked Tyrant, and a King, we are to examin who is the Tyrant, and who the King; for the name confer'd or assum'd cannot make a King, unless he be one. He who is not a King, can have no Title to the rights belonging to him who is truly a King: so that a People who find themselves wickedly and barbarously opprest by a Tyrant, may destroy him and his Tyranny without giving offence to any King.</P>
<P>But 'tis strange that <HI>Filmer</HI> should speak of the Barbarity and Wicked∣ness of a Tyrant, who looks upon the World to be the Patrimony of one man; and for the foundation of his Doctrin, asserts such a power in eve∣ry one that makes himself master of any part, as cannot be limited by any Law. His Title is not to be question'd; Usurpation and Violence confer an incontestable Right: the exercise of his Power is no more to be disputed than the Acquisition: his will is a Law to his Subjects; and no Law can be impos'd by them upon his Conduct. For if these things be true, I know not how any man could ever be call'd a Tyrant, that name having never bin given to any unless for usurping a Power that did not be∣long to him, or an unjust exercise of that which had bin confer'd upon him, and violating the Laws which ought to be a rule to him. 'Tis also hard to imagin how any man can be call'd barbarous and wicked, if he be oblig'd by no Law but that of his own Pleasure; for we have no other notion of wrong, than that it is a breach of the Law which determins what is right. If the lives and goods of Subjects depend upon the Will
<PB N="206" REF="210"/>
 of the Prince, and he in his profound Wisdom preserve them only to be beneficial to himself, they can have no other right than what he gives, and without injustice may retain when he thinks fit: If there be no wrong, there can be no just revenge; and he that pretends to seek it, is not a free man vindicating his Right, but a perverse slave rising up against his Master. But if there be such a thing as a barbarous and wicked Ty∣rant, there must be a rule relating to the acquisition and exercise of the Power, by which he may be distinguish'd from a just King; and a Law superior to his Will, by the violation of which he becomes barbarous and wicked.</P>
<P>Tho our Author so sar forgets himself, to confess this to be true, he seeks to destroy the fruits of it by such flattery as comprehends all that is most detestable in Profaneness and Blasphemy, and gives the name of Gods to the most execrable of men. He may by such language deserve the name of <HI>Heylin</HI>'s Disciple; but will find few among the Heathens so base∣ly servile, or so boldly impious. Tho <HI>Claudius Cesar</HI> was a drunken sot, and transported with the extravagance of his Fortune, he detested the im∣pudence of his Predecessor <HI>Caligula,</HI> (who affected that Title) and in his Rescript to the Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> gives it no better name than <HI>turpem Caii insaniam.</HI> For this reason it was rejected by all his Pagan Successors, who were not as furiously wicked as he: yet <HI>Filmer</HI> has thought fit to renew it, for the benefit of Mankind, and the Glory of the Christian Religion.</P>
<P>I know not whether these extreme and barbarous Errors of our Au∣thor are to be imputed to wickedness or madness; or whether, to save the pains of a distinction, they may not rightly be said to be the same thing: but nothing less than the excess of both could induce him to attri∣bute any thing of good to the fears of a Tyrant, since they are the chief causes of all the mischiefs he dos. <HI>Tertullian</HI> says they are <HI>Metu quam fu∣rore saeviores;</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> speaking of a most wicked King, says, that he did <HI>Saevitiam ignaviae obtendere:</HI> and we do not more certainly find that Cowards are the cruellest of men, than that wickedness makes them Cowards; that every man's fears bear a proportion with his guilt, and with the number, vertue, and strength of those he has offended. He who usurps a power over all, or abuses a Trust repos'd in him by all, in the highest measure offends all; he fears and hates those he has offended, and to secure himself, aggravates the former Injurys: When these are publick, they beget a universal Hatred, and every man desires to extin∣guish a Mischief that threatens ruin to all. This will always be terrible to one that knows he has deserv'd it; and when those he dreads are the body of the People, nothing but a publick destruction can satisfy his rage, and appease his fears.</P>
<P>I wish I could agree with <HI>Filmer,</HI> in exempting multitudes from fears; for they having seldom committed any injustice, unless thro fear, would, as far as human fragility permits, be free from it. Tho the <HI>Attick Ostracism</HI> was not an extreme Punishment, I know nothing usually practis'd in any Commonwealth, that did so much savor of injustice: but it proceeded solely from a fear that one man, tho in appearance vertuous, when he came to be rais'd too much above his fellow-Citizens, might be tempted to invade the publick Liberty. We do not find that the <HI>Athenians,</HI> or any other free Citys, ever injur'd any man, unless thro such a jealousy, or the perjury of Witnesses, by which the best Tribunals that ever were, or can be establish'd in the world, may be misled; and no injustice could
<PB N="207" REF="211"/>
be apprehended from any, if they did not fall into such fears. </P>
<P>But tho Multitudes may have fears as well as Tyrants, the Causes and Effects of them are very different. A People, in relation to domestick Affairs, can desire nothing but Liberty, and neither hate or fear any but such as do, or would, as they suspect, deprive them of that Happiness: Their endeavors to secure that seldom hurt any except such as invade their Rights; and if they err, the mistake is for the most part discover'd be∣fore it produce any mischief; and the greatest that ever came that way, was the death of one, or a few men. Their Hatred and desire of Revenge can go no farther than the sense of the Injury receiv'd or fear'd, and is extinguish'd by the death or banishment of the Persons; as may be ga∣ther'd from the examples of the <HI>Tarquins, Decemviri, Cassius, Melius,</HI> and <HI>Manlius Capitolinus.</HI> He therefore that would know whether the hatred and fear of a Tyrant, or of a People, produces the greater mis∣chiefs, needs only to consider, whether it be better that the Tyrant de∣stroy the People, or that the People destroy the Tyrant: or at the worst, whether one that is suspected of affecting the Tyranny should perish, or a whole People, amongst whom very many are certainly innocent; and experience shows that such are always first sought out to be destroy'd for being so: Popular furys or fears, how irregular or unjust soever they may be, can extend no farther; general Calamitys can only be brought upon a People by those who are enemys to the whole Body, which can never be the Multitude, for they are that Body. In all other respects, the fears that render a Tyrant cruel, render a People gentle and cautious; for every single man knowing himself to be of little power, not only fears to do in∣justice because it may be reveng'd upon his Person, by him, or his Friends, Kindred and Relations, that suffers it; but because it tends to the over∣throw of the Government, which comprehends all publick and private Concernments, and which every man knows cannot subsist unless it be so easy and gentle, as to be pleasing to those who are the best, and have the greatest power: and as the publick Considerations divert them from do∣ing those Injurys that may bring immediate prejudice to the Publick, so there are strict Laws to restrain all such as would do private Injurys. If neither the People nor the Magistrats of <HI>Venice, Switzerland,</HI> and <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> commit such extravagances as are usual in other places, it dos not perhaps proceed from the temper of those Nations different from others, but from a knowledg, that whosoever offers an injury to a private person, or attempts a publick mischief, is expos'd to the impartial and inexorable Power of the Law; whereas the chief work of an absolute Monarch is to place himself above the Law, and thereby rendring himself the Au∣thor of all the evils that the People suffer, 'tis absurd to expect that he should remove them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXX. A Monarchy cannot be well regulated, unless the Powers of the Monarch are limited by Law.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's next step is not only to reject Popular Governments, but all such Monarchys as are not absolute: <HI>for if the King,</HI> says he, <HI>admits the People to be his Companions, he leaves to be a King.</HI> This
<PB N="208" REF="212"/>
 is the language of <HI>French</HI> Lackeys, Valet de Chambre's, Taylors, and others like them in Wisdom, Learning and Policy, who when they fly to <HI>England</HI> for fear of a well deserv'd Gally, Gibbet, or Wheel, are rea∣dy to say, <HI>Il faut que le Roy soit absolu, autrement il n'est point Roy.</HI> And finding no better men to agree with <HI>Filmer</HI> in this sublime Philosophy, I may be pardon'd if I do not follow them, till I am convinc'd in these en∣suing points.</P>
<P>1. It seems absurd to speak of Kings admitting the Nobility or People to part of the Government: for tho there may be, and are Nations with∣out Kings, yet no man can conceive a King without a People. These must necessarily have all the power originally in themselves; and tho Kings may and often have a power of granting Honors, Immunitys, and Privileges to private Men or Corporations, he dos it only out of the publick Stock, which he is entrusted to distribute; but can give nothing to the People, who give to him all that he can rightly have.</P>
<P>2. 'Tis strange that he who frequently cites <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Plato,</HI> should unluckily acknowledg such only to be Kings as they call Tyrants, and deny the name of King to those, who in their opinion are the only Kings.</P>
<P>3. I cannot understand why the Scripture should call those Kings whose Powers were limited, if they only are Kings who are absolute; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE>or why <HI>Moses</HI> did appoint that the power of Kings in <HI>Israel</HI> should be li∣mited (if they resolv'd to have them) if that limitation destroy'd the be∣ing of a King.</P>
<P>4. And lastly, how he knows that in the Kingdoms which have a shew of Popularity, the Power is wholly in the King.</P>
<P>The first point was prov'd when we examin'd the beginning of Monar∣chys, and found it impossible that there could be any thing of justice in them, unless they were establish'd by the common consent of those who were to live under them; or that they could make any such establishment, unless the right and power were in them.</P>
<P>Secondly, Neither <HI>Plato</HI> nor <HI>Aristotle</HI> acknowledg either reason or ju∣stice in the power of a Monarch, unless he has more of the Vertues con∣ducing to the good of the Civil Society than all those who compose it; and employ them for the publick advantage, and not to his own pleasure and profit, as being set up by those who seek their own good, for no other reason than that he should procure it. To this end a Law is set as a rule to him, and the best men, that is such as are most like to himself, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plat. de Leg. Arist. Polit.</NOTE>made to be his Assistants, because, say they, <HI>Lex est mens sine affectu, &amp; quasi Deus;</HI> whereas the best of men have their affections and passions, and are subject to be misled by them: Which shews, that as the Monarch is not for himself nor by himself, he dos not give, but receive power, nor ad∣mit others to the participation of it, but is by them admitted to what he has. Whereupon they conclude, that to prefer the absolute power of a man, as in those Governments which they call <HI>Barbarorum regna,</HI> be∣fore the regular Government of Kings justly exercising a power insti∣tuted by Law, and directed to the publick good, is to chuse rather to be subject to the lust of a Beast, than to be govern'd by a God. And because such a choice can only be made by a Beast, I leave our Author to find a de∣scription of himself in their Books, which he so often cites.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Aristotle</HI> deserves credit, the Princes who reign for themselves and not for the People, preferring their own pleasure or profit before the publick, become Tyrants; which in his language is Enemys to God and
<PB N="209" REF="213"/>
Man. On this account <HI>Boccalini</HI> introduces the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> raising a mutiny against him in <HI>Parnassus,</HI> for giving such definitions of Tyrants as they said comprehended them all; and forcing the poor Philosopher to declare by a new definition, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Che I Tiranni furono ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omini del tempo antico de i quali hoggidi si e perdu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> la razz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>occal.

<P>In the third place, The Scriptures declare the necessity of setting bounds to those who are plac'd in the highest dignitys. <HI>Moses</HI> seems to have had as great abilitys as any man that ever liv'd in the world; but he alone was not able to bear the weight of the Government, and therefore God ap∣pointed Seventy chosen men to be his assistants. This was a perpetual Law to <HI>Israel;</HI> and as no King was to have more power than <HI>Moses,</HI> or more abilitys to perform the Dutys of his Office, none could be exempted from the necessity of wanting the like helps. Our Author therefore must confess that they are Kings who have them, or that Kingly Government is contrary to the Scriptures. When God by <HI>Moses</HI> gave liberty to his People to make a King, he did it under these conditions. <HI>He must be one</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE><HI>of their Brethren: They must chuse him: he must not multiply Gold, Silver, Wives, or Horses: he must not lift up his Heart above his Brethren.</HI> And <HI>Josephus</HI> paraphrasing upon the place, says, <HI>He shall do nothing without the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiq. Jud.</NOTE><HI>advice of the</HI> Sanhedrin; <HI>or if he do, they shall oppose him.</HI> This agrees with the confession of <HI>Zedekiah</HI> to the Princes (which was the <HI>Sanhedrin) The King can do nothing without you;</HI> and seems to have bin in pursuance of the Law of the Kingdom, which was written in a Book, and laid up <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>before the Lord; and could not but agree with that of <HI>Moses,</HI> unless they spake by different Spirits, or that the Spirit by which they did speak was subject to error or change: and the whole series of God's Law shews, that the Pride, Magnificence, Pomp and Glory usurp'd by their Kings was utterly contrary to the will of God. They did lift up their hearts above their Brethren, which was forbidden by the Law. All the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> and most of the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> utterly rejected it; and every one of them did very much depart from the observation of it. I will not deny that the People in their institution of a King intended they should do so: they had done it themselves, and would have a King that might uphold them in their disobedience; they were addicted to the Idolatry of their accursed Neighbours, and desir'd that Government by which it was maintain'd amongst them. In doing this they did not reject <HI>Samuel;</HI> but they rejected God that he should not reign over them. They might perhaps believe that unless their King were such as the Law did not per∣mit, he would not perform what they intended; or that the name of King did not belong to him, unless he had a power that the Law deny'd. But since God and his Prophets give the name of King to the chief Magistrate, endow'd with a power that was restrain'd within very narrow limits, whom they might without offence set up, we also may safely give the same to those of the same nature, whether it please <HI>Filmer</HI> or not.</P>
<P>4. The practice of most Nations, and (I may truly say) of all that deserve imitation, has bin as directly contrary to the absolute power of one man as their Constitutions: or if the original of many Governments lie hid in
<PB N="210" REF="214"/>
 the impenetrable darkness of Antiquity, their progress may serve to shew the intention of the Founders. <HI>Aristotle</HI> seems to think that the first Monarchs having bin chosen for their Vertue, were little restrain'd in the exercise of their Power; but that they or their Children falling into Cor∣ruption and Pride, grew odious; and that Nations did on that account either abolish their Authority, or create Senats and other Magistrats, who having part of the Power, might keep them in order. The <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings were certainly of this nature; and the <HI>Persian,</HI> till they conquer'd <HI>Babylon.</HI> Nay, I may safely say, that neither the Kings which the fran∣tick people set up in opposition to the Law of God, nor those of the bor∣dering Nations, whose example they chose to follow, had that absolute power which our Author attributes to all Kings as inseparable from the name. <HI>Achish</HI> the <HI>Philistin</HI> lov'd and admir'd <HI>David;</HI> he look'd upon him as an Angel of God, and promis'd that he should be the keeper of <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 29.</NOTE>his Head for ever: but when the Princes suspected him, and said <HI>he shall not go down with us to Battel,</HI> he was oblig'd to dismiss him. This was not the language of Slaves, but of those who had a great part in the Govern∣ment; and the King's submission to their will, shows that he was more like to the Kings of <HI>Sparta,</HI> than to an absolute Monarch, who dos what∣ever pleases him. I know not whether the <HI>Spartans</HI> were descended from the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> as some think; but their Kings were under a regulati∣on much like that of the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deuter.</HI> tho they had two: Their Senate of twenty eight, and the <HI>Ephori,</HI> had a power like to that of the <HI>Sanhedrin;</HI> and by them Kings were condemn'd to fines, imprisonment, banishment, and death, as appears by the examples of <HI>Pausanias, Cleony∣mus, Leonidas, Agis,</HI> and others. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> Disciplin was the same; <NOTE PLACE="marg">More Nevo∣chim.</NOTE><HI>Reges Davidicae stirpis,</HI> says <HI>Maimonides, judicabant &amp; judicabantur.</HI> They gave testimony in judgment when they were call'd, and testimony was given against them. Whereas the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> as the same Au∣thor <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>says, were <HI>superbi, corde elati, &amp; spertores legis, nec judicabant, nec judicabantur;</HI> proud, insolent, and contemners of the Law, who would neither judg, nor submit to judgment as the Law commanded. But the Fruits they gather'd were sutable to the Seed they had sown, and their Crimes were not left unpunish'd: they who despis'd the Law were destroy'd without Law; and when no ordinary course could be taken against them for their excesses, they were overthrown by force, and the Crown within the space of few years was transported into nine several Familys▪ with the utter extirpation of those that had possest it. On the other hand, there never was any Sedition against the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings; and after the moderate Disciplin, according to which they liv'd, was esta∣blish'd, none of them dy'd by the hands of their Subjects, except only two, who were put to death in a way of Justice: the Kingdom continu'd in the same races, till <HI>Cleomenes</HI> was defeated by <HI>Antigonus,</HI> and the Go∣vernment overthrown by the <HI>Macedonians.</HI> This gave occasion to those bestial Tyrants <HI>Nabis</HI> and <HI>Machanidas</HI> to set up such a Government as our Author recommends to the World, which immediately brought destructi∣on upon themselves, and the whole City. The <HI>Germans,</HI> who pretend∣ed to be descended from the <HI>Spartans,</HI> had the like Government. Their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Germ.</NOTE>Princes according to their merit had the <HI>credit of persuading, not the power of commanding;</HI> and the question was not what part of the Government they would allow to the Nobility and People, but what the Nobility and People would give to their Princes: and 'tis not much material to our present dispute, whether they learnt this from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome obscure knowledg of
<PB N="211" REF="215"/>
the Law which God gave to his People, or whether led by the light of Reason, which is also from God, they discover'd what was altogether conformable to that Law. Whoever understands the affairs of <HI>Germany,</HI> knows that the present Emperors, notwithstandiug their haughty Title, have a power limited as in the days of <HI>Tacitus.</HI> If they are good and wise, they may persuade; but they can command no farther than the Law allows. They do not admit the Princes, Noblemen, and Citys to the power which they all exercise in their general Diets, and each of them within their own Precincts; but they exercise that which has bin by publick consent bestow'd upon them. All the Kingdoms peopled from the North observ'd the same rules. In all of them the powers were divided between the Kings, the Nobility, Clergy, and Commons; and by the Decrees of Councils, Diets, Parliaments, Cortez, and Assem∣blys of Estates, Authority and Liberty were so balanc'd, that such Prin∣ces as assum'd to themselves more than the Law did permit, were severely punish'd; and those who did by force or fraud invade Thrones, were by force thrown down from them.</P>
<P>This was equally beneficial to Kings and People. The Powers, as <HI>Theopompus</HI> King of <HI>Sparta</HI> said, were most safe when they were least envy'd and hated. <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th</HI> of <HI>France</HI> was one of the first that broke this Golden Chain; and by more subtil Arts than had bin formerly known, subverted the Laws, by which the fury of Kings had bin re∣strain'd, and taught others to do the like; tho all of them have not so well sav'd themselves from punishment. <HI>James</HI> the third of <HI>Scotland</HI> was one of his most apt Scholars; and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ab hominibus infimae sortis in omnia simul vitia est praeceps datus: tempora etiam corrupta &amp; vicinorum regum exempla non parum ad eum evertendum juverunt: Nam &amp; Edvardus in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glia, Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lus in Burgundia, Ludovicus undecimus in Gallia, Joannes secundus in Lusitania, tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idis fundamenta jec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>runt: Richardus tertius in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glia eam immanissime exercuit. <BIBL>Hist.

<P>This could not have bin, if all the Power had always bin in Kings, and neither the People nor the Nobility had ever had any: For no man can be said to gain that which he and his Predecessors always possest, or to take from others that which they never had; nor to set up any sort of Government, if it had bin always the same. But the aforesaid <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th</HI> did assume to himself a Power above that of his Predecessors; and <HI>Philip de Commines</HI> shews the ways by which he acquir'd it, with the miserable effects of his Acquisition both to himself and to his people: Modern Authors observe that the change was made by him, and for that reason he is said by <HI>Mezeray,</HI> and others, <HI>to have brought those Kings out of</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Davoir mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> les Roys hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de page.</NOTE><HI>Guardianship:</HI> they were not therefore so till he emancipated them. Nevertheless this Emancipation had no resemblance to the unlimited Power of which our Author dreams.

 held at <HI>Orleans</HI> in the time of <HI>Francis</HI> the second, asserts the whole <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thuan. Hist. l. 1.</NOTE>Power of the Nation to have bin in them. <HI>Monsieur de Thou</HI> says the same thing, and adds, that the King dying suddenly, the Assembly con∣tinu'd even at the desire of the Council, in the exercise of that Power, till they had settled the Regency, and other Affairs of the highest impor∣tance, according to their own judgment. <HI>Hottoman,</HI> a Lawyer of that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hottom. Fran∣co-Gallia.</NOTE>Time and Nation, famous for his Learning, Judgment, and Integrity, having diligently examin'd the antient Laws and Historys of that King∣dom, distinctly proves that the <HI>French</HI> Nation never had any Kings but of their own chusing; that their Kings had no Power except what was confer'd upon them; and that they had bin remov'd, when they exces∣sively abus'd or render'd themselves unworthy of that Trust. This is sufficiently clear by the forecited examples of <HI>Pharamond</HI>'s Grandchildren, and the degenerated Races of <HI>Meroveus</HI> and <HI>Pepin;</HI> of which many were depos'd, some of the nearest in Blood excluded; and when their Vices seem'd to be incorrigible, they were wholly rejected. All this was done by virtue of that rule which they call the <HI>Salique Law:</HI> And tho some of our Princes pretending to the Inheritance of that Crown by marrying the Heirs Ge∣neral, deny'd that there was any such thing, no man can say that for the space of above twelve hundred years, Females, or their Descendents, who are by that Law excluded, have ever bin thought to have any right to the Crown: And no Law, unless it be explicitely given by God, can be of greater Authority than one which has bin in force for so many Ages. What the beginning of it was is not known: But <HI>Charles</HI> the sixth reced∣ing from this Law, and thinking to dispose of the Succession otherwise than was ordain'd by it, was esteem'd mad, and all his Acts rescinded. And tho the Reputation, Strength and Valor of the <HI>English,</HI> commanded by <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, one of the bravest Princes that have ever bin in the world, was terrible to the <HI>French</HI> Nation; yet they oppos'd him to the utmost of their power, rather than suffer that Law to be broken. And tho our Success under his Conduct was great and admirable; yet soon af∣ter his death, with the expence of much Blood and Treasure, we lost all that we had on that side, and suffer'd the Penalty of having unadvisedly enter'd into that Quarrel. By virtue of the same Law, the Agreement made by King <HI>John</HI> when he was Prisoner at <HI>London,</HI> by which he had alie∣nated part of that Dominion, as well as that of <HI>Francis</HI> the first, conclud∣ed when he was under the same Circumstances at <HI>Madrid,</HI> were reputed null; and upon all occasions that Nation has given sufficient testimony, that the Laws by which they live are their own, made by themselves, and not impos'd upon them. And 'tis as impossible for them who made and depos'd Kings, exalted or deprest reigning Familys, and prescrib'd Rules to the Succession, to have receiv'd from their own Creatures the Power, or part of the Government they had, as for a man to be begotten by his own Son. Nay, tho their Constitution was much chang'd by <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th,</HI> yet they retain'd so much of their antient Liberty, that in the last Age, when the House of <HI>Valois</HI> was as much deprav'd as those of <HI>Meroveus</HI> and <HI>Pepin</HI> had bin, and <HI>Henry</HI> the third by his own Leud∣ness, Hypocrisy, Cruelty and Impurity, together with the baseness of his Minions and Favorites, had render'd himself odious and contemptible to the Nobility and People; the great Citys, Parliaments, the greater and (in political matters) the sounder part of the Nation declar'd him to be fallen from the Crown, and pursu'd him to the death, tho the blow was given by the hand of a base and half-distracted Monk.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="217"/>
<HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bourbon</HI> was without controversy the next Heir; but neither the Nobility nor the People, who thought themselves in the Government, would admit him to the Crown, till he had given them satisfaction that he would govern according to their Laws, by abjuring his Religion which they judg'd inconsistent with them.</P>
<P>The later Commotions in <HI>Paris, Bourdeaux,</HI> and other places, toge∣ther with the Wars for Religion, shew, that tho the <HI>French</HI> do not com∣plain of every Grievance, and cannot always agree in the defence and vindication of their violated Libertys, yet they very well understand their Rights: and that, as they do not live by, or for the King, but he reigns by, and for them; so their Privileges are not from him, but that his Crown is from them; and that, according to the true Rule of their Government, he can do nothing against their Laws, or if he do, they may oppose him.</P>
<P>The Institution of a Kingdom is the act of a free Nation; and whoe∣ver denies them to be free, denies that there can be any thing of right in what they set up. That which was true in the beginning is so, and must be so for ever. This is so far acknowledg'd by the highest Monarchs, that in a Treatise publish'd in the year 1667, by Authority of the present King of <HI>France,</HI> to justify his pretensions to some part of the <HI>Low Coun∣trys,</HI> notwithstanding all the Acts of himself, and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to extinguish them, it is said, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Que les Roys ont certe bienheureuse impuissance de ne pouvoir rien faire contre les loix de leut pays. <BIBL>Traité des dro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> de la Reyne.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>That Kings are under the happy inability to do any thing against the Laws of their Country.</HI> And tho perhaps he may do things contrary to Law, yet he grounds his Power upon the Law; and the most able and most trusted of his Ministers declare the same. About the year 1660, the Count <HI>D' Aubijoux,</HI> a man of eminent quality in <HI>Lan∣guedoc,</HI> but averse to the Court, and hated by Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> had bin try'd by the Parliament of <HI>Tholouse</HI> for a Duel, in which a Gentle∣man was kill'd; and it appearing to the Court (then in that City) that he had bin acquitted upon forg'd Letters of Grace, false Witnesses, power∣ful Friends, and other undue means, <HI>Mazarin</HI> desir'd to bring him to a new Trial: but the Chancellor <HI>Seguier</HI> told the Queen-Mother it could not be; for the Law did not permit a man once acquitted to be again que∣stion'd for the same Fact; and that if the course of the Law were inter∣rupted, neither the Salique Law, nor the succession of her Children, or any thing else could be secure in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This is farther prov'd by the Historys of that Nation. The Kings of <HI>Meroveus</HI> and <HI>Pepin</HI>'s Races, were suffer'd to divide the Kingdom a∣mongst their Sons; or, as <HI>Hottoman</HI> says, the Estates made the Division, and allotted to each such a part as they thought fit. But when this way was found to be prejudicial to the Publick, an Act of State was made in the time of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> by which it was ordain'd, that for the future the Kingdom should not be dismembred; which Constitution continuing in force to this day, the Sons or Brothers of their Kings receive such an <HI>A∣pannage</HI> (they call it) as is bestow'd on them, remaining subject to the Crown as well as other men. And there has bin no King of <HI>France</HI> since that time (except only <HI>Charles</HI> the sixth) who has not acknowledg∣ed that he cannot alienate any part of their Dominion.</P>
<P>Whoever imputes the acknowledgment of this to Kingcraft, and says, that they who avow this when 'tis for their advantage, will deny it on a

 different occasion, is of all men their most dangerous Enemy. In laying such fraud to their charge, he destroys the veneration by which they sub∣sist, and teaches Subjects not to keep Faith with those, who by the most malicious deceits show, that they are ty'd by none. Human Societys are maintain'd by mutual Contracts, which are of no value if they are not observ'd. Laws are made, and Magistrats created to cause them to be perform'd in publick and private matters, and to punish those who vio∣late them. But none will ever be observ'd, if he who receives the greatest benefit by them, and is set up to oversee others, give the example <NOTE PLACE="marg">Suarum legum lator &amp; ever∣sor. <HI>Tacit.</HI></NOTE>to those who of themselves are too much inclin'd to break them. The first step that <HI>Pompey</HI> made to his own ruin was, by violating the Laws he himself had propos'd. But it would be much worse for Kings to break those that are establish'd by the Authority of a whole People, and con∣firm'd by the succession of many Ages.</P>
<P>I am far from laying any such blemishes on them, or thinking that they deserve them. I must believe the <HI>French</HI> King speaks sincerely, when he says he can do nothing against the Laws of his Country: And that our King <HI>James</HI> did the like, when he acknowledg'd himself to be the Ser∣vant of the Commonwealth; and the rather, because 'tis true, and that he is plac'd in the Throne to that end. Nothing is more essential and fundamental in the Constitutions of Kingdoms, than that Diets, Parlia∣ments, and Assemblys of Estates should see this perform'd. 'Tis not the King that gives them a right to judg of matters of War or Peace, to grant Supplys of men and mony, or to deny them; and to make or abrogate Laws at their pleasure: All the Powers rightly belonging to Kings, or to them, proceed from the same root. The Northern Nations seeing what mischiefs were generally brought upon the Eastern, by refer∣ring too much to the irregular will of a man; and what those who were more generous had suffer'd, when one man by the force of a corrupt mercenary Soldiery had overthrown the Laws by which they liv'd, fear'd they might fall into the same misery; and therefore retain'd the greater part of the Power to be exercis'd by their General Assemblys, or by Delegates, when they grew so numerous that they could not meet. These are the Kingdoms of which <HI>Grotius</HI> speaks, <HI>where the King has his part, and the Senat or People their part of the supreme Authority;</HI> and where the Law prescribes such limits, <HI>that if the King attempts to seize that part which is not his, he may justly be oppos'd:</HI> Which is as much as to say, that the Law upholds the Power it gives, and turns against those who abuse it.</P>
<P>This Doctrin may be displeasing to Court-Parasites; but is no less pro∣fitable to such Kings as follow better Counsels, than to the Nations that live under them: the Wisdom and Vertue of the best is always fortify'd by the concurrence of those who are plac'd in part of the Power; they always do what they will, when they will nothing but that which is good; and 'tis a happy impotence in those, who thro ignorance or malice desire to do evil, not to be able to effect it. The weakness of such as by defects of Nature, Sex, Age, or Education, are not able of themselves to bear the weight of a Kingdom, is thereby supported, and they together with the People under them preserv'd from ruin; the furi∣ous rashness of the Insolent is restrain'd; the extravagance of those who are naturally leud, is aw'd; and the bestial madness of the most violent∣ly wicked and outrageous, supprest. When the Law provides for these matters, and prescribes ways by which they may be accomplish'd, every
<PB N="215" REF="219"/>
man who receives or fears any Injury, seeks a remedy in a legal way, and vents his Passions in such a manner as brings no prejudice to the Commonwealth: If his Complaints against a King may be heard, and redrest by Courts of Justice, Parliaments, and Diets, as well as against private men, he is satisfy'd, and looks no farther for a Remedy. But if Kings, like those of <HI>Israel,</HI> will neither judg nor be judg'd, and there be no Power orderly to redress private or publick Injurys, every man has re∣course to force, as if he liv'd in a Wood where there is no Law; and that force is generally mortal to those who provoke it: No Guards can preserve a hated Prince from the vengeance of one resolute hand; and they as often fall by the Swords of their own Guards as of others: Wrongs will be done, and when they that do them cannot or will not be judg'd publickly, the injur'd Persons become Judges in their own case, and Exe∣cutioners of their own sentence. If this be dangerous in matters of pri∣vate concernment, 'tis much more so in those relating to the publick. The leud extravagances of <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Seconds, whilst they acknowledg'd the power of the Law, were gently reprov'd and re∣strain'd with the removal of some profligate Favorites; but when they would admit of no other Law than their own Will, no relief could be had but by their Deposition. The lawful <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings, who were obe∣dient to the Laws of their Country, liv'd in safety, and dy'd with glory; whereas 'tis a strange thing to see a lawless Tyrant die without such in∣famy and misery, as held a just proportion with the wickedness of his Life. They did, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> says of <HI>Dionysius, many mischiefs, and suf∣fer'd</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit. Timoleon▪</NOTE><HI>more.</HI> This is confirm'd by the examples of the Kingdom of <HI>Israel,</HI> and of the Empires of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece;</HI> they who would submit to no Law, were destroy'd without any. I know not whether they thought themselves to be Gods, as our Author says they were; but I am sure the most part of them dy'd like Dogs, and had the burial of Asses rather than of Men.</P>
<P>This is the happiness to which our Author would promote them all. <HI>If a King admits a People to be his companions, he ceases to be a King, and the State becomes a Democracy.</HI> And a little farther: <HI>If in such Assemblys, the King, Nobility, and People, have equal shares in the Sovereignty, then the King has but one voice, the Nobility likewise one, and the People one; and then any two of these voices should have power to overrule the third: Thus the Nobility and Commons should have a power to make a Law to bridle the King, which was never seen in any Kingdom.</HI> We have heard of Nations that admitted a man to reign over them (that is, made him King) but of no man that made a People. The <HI>Hebrews</HI> made <HI>Saul, David, Jeroboam,</HI> and other Kings: when they return'd from Captivity, they confer'd the same Title upon the <HI>Asmonean</HI> race, as a reward of their Valor and Ver∣tue. The <HI>Romans</HI> chose <HI>Romulus, Numa, Hostilius,</HI> and others to be their Kings; the <HI>Spartans</HI> instituted two, one of the <HI>Heraclidae,</HI> the other of the <HI>Aeacid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI> Other Nations set up one, a few, or more Magistrats to govern them: and all the World agrees, that <HI>Qui dat esse, dat modum esse;</HI> He that makes him to be, makes him to be what is: and nothing can be more absurd than to say, that he who has nothing but what is given, can have more than is given to him. If <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Romulus</HI> had no other title to be Kings, than what the People confer'd upon them, they could be no otherwise Kings than as pleas'd the People: They therefore did not admit the People to be partakers of the Government; but the People who had all in themselves, and could not have made a King if
<PB N="216" REF="220"/>
 they had not had it, bestow'd upon him what they thought fit, and re∣tain'd the rest in themselves. If this were not so, then instead of saying to the multitude, <HI>Will ye have this man to reign?</HI> they ought to say to the man, <HI>Wilt thou have this multitude to be a People?</HI> And whereas the No∣bles of <HI>Arragon</HI> us'd to say to their new made King, <HI>We who are as good as you, make you our King, on condition you keep and maintain our Rights and Libertys, and if not, not;</HI> he should have said to them, I who am better than you, make you to be a People, and will govern you as I please. But I doubt whether he would have succeeded, till that Kingdom was join'd to others of far greater strength, from whence a power might be drawn to force them out of their usual method.</P>
<P>That which has bin said of the Governments of <HI>England, France,</HI> and o∣ther Countrys, shows them to be of the same nature; and if they deserve not the name of Kingdoms, and that their Princes will by our Author's Arguments be persuaded to leave them, those Nations perhaps will be so humble to content themselves without that magnificent Title, rather than resign their own Libertys to purchase it: and if this will not please him, he may seek his glorious sovereign Monarchy among the wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> or in the Island of <HI>Ceylon;</HI> for it will not be found among civiliz'd Nations.</P>
<P>However more ignorance cannot be exprest, than by giving the name of <HI>Democracy</HI> to those Governments that are compos'd of the three simple species, as we have prov'd that all the good ones have ever bin: for in a strict sense it can only sute with those, where the People retain to them∣selves the administration of the supreme Power; and more largely, when the popular part, as in <HI>Athens,</HI> greatly overbalances the other two, and that the denomination is taken from the prevailing part. But our Author, if I mistake not, is the first that ever took the antient Governments of <HI>Israel, Sparta</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> or those of <HI>England, France, Germany</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> to be <HI>Democracys,</HI> only because every one of them had Senats and Assem∣blys of the People, who in their Persons, or by their Deputys, did join with their chief Magistrats in the exercise of the supreme Power. That of <HI>Israel,</HI> to the time of <HI>Saul,</HI> is call'd by <HI>Josephus</HI> an <HI>Aristocracy.</HI> The same name is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven to that of <HI>Sparta</HI> by all the <HI>Greek</HI> Authors; and the great contest in the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War was between the two kinds of Go∣vernment; the Citys that were govern'd Aristocratically, or desir'd to be so, following the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> and such as delighted in <HI>Democracy,</HI> taking part with the <HI>Athenians.</HI> In like manner <HI>Rome, England,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> were said to be under Monarchys; not that their Kings might do what they pleas'd, but because one man had a preheminence above any other. Yet if the <HI>Romans</HI> could take <HI>Romulus,</HI> the Son of a man that was never known, <HI>Numa</HI> a <HI>Sabin, Hostilius</HI> and <HI>Ancus Martius</HI> pri∣vate men, and <HI>Tarquinius Priscus</HI> the Son of a banish'd <HI>Corinthian,</HI> who had no Title to a preference before others till it was bestow'd upon them; 'tis ridiculous to think, that they who gave them what they had, could not set what limits they pleas'd to their own gift.</P>
<P>But, says our Author, <HI>The Nobility will then have one Voice, and the Peo∣ple another, and they joining may overrule the third, which was never seen in any Kingdom.</HI> This may perhaps be one way of regulating the Monar∣chical Power, but it is not necessary, nor the only one: There may be a Senate, tho the People be excluded; that Senate may be compos'd of men chosen for their Vertue, as well as for the Nobility of their Birth: The Government may consist of King and People without a Senate; or the
<PB N="217" REF="221"/>
Senate may be compos'd only of the Peoples Delegates. But if I should grant his assertion to be true, the reasonableness of such a Constitution cannot be destroy'd by the consequences he endeavors to draw from it; for he who would instruct the world in matters of State, must show what is, or ought to be, not what he fancys may thereupon ensue. Besides, it dos not follow, that where there are three equal Votes, Laws should be always made by the plurality; for the consent of all the three is in many places requir'd: and 'tis certain that in <HI>England,</HI> and other parts, the King and one of the Estates cannot make a Law without the concur∣rence of the other. But to please <HI>Filmer,</HI> I will avow, that where the Nobles and Commons have an equal Vote, they may join and over-rule or limit the power of the King: and I leave any reasonable man to judg, whether it be more safe and fit, that those two Estates comprehending the whole body of the Nation in their Persons, or by representation, should have a right to over-rule or limit the power of that man, woman, or child, who sits in the Throne; or that he or she, young or old, wise or foolish, good or bad, should over rule them, and by their vices, weakness, folly, impertinence, incapacity, or malice, put a stop to their proceedings; and whether the chief concernments of a Nation may more safely and prudently be made to depend upon the votes of so many emi∣nent Persons, amongst whom many wise and good men will always be found if there be any in the Nation, and who in all respects have the same interest with them, or upon the will of one, who may be, and often is as vile, ignorant, and wretched as the meanest Slave; and either has, or is for the most part made to believe he has, an interest so contrary to them, that their suppression is his Advancement. Common sense so naturally leads us to the decision of this Question, that I should not think it possible for Mankind to have mistaken, tho we had no examples of it in History: and 'tis in vain to say, that all Princes are not such as I repre∣sent; for if a right were annex'd to the being of a Prince, and that his single judgment should over-balance that of a whole Nation, it must be∣long to him as a Prince, and be enjoy'd by the worst and basest, as well as by the wisest and best, which would inevitably draw on the absurditys above mention'd. But that many are, and have bin such, no man can deny, or reasonably hope that they will not often prove to be such, as long as any preference is granted to those who have nothing to recom∣mend them, but the Familys from whence they derive; a continual succession of those who excel in Vertue, Wisdom, and Experience, being promis'd to none, nor reasonably to be expected from any. Such a Right therefore cannot be claim'd by all; and if not by all, then not by any, unless it proceed from a particular grant in consideration of personal Vertue, Ability, and Integrity, which must be prov'd: and when any one goes about to do it, I will either acknowledg him to be in the right, or give the reasons of my denial.</P>
<P>However this is nothing to the general Proposition: nay, if a man were to be found, who had more of the qualitys requir'd for making a right judgment in matters of the greatest importance, than a whole Nation, or an Assembly of the best men chosen out of it (which I never heard to have bin, unless in the Persons of <HI>Moses, Joshua,</HI> or <HI>Samuel,</HI> who had the Spirit of God for their guide) it would be nothing to our purpose; for even he might be biass'd by his personal Interests, which Governments are not establish'd to promote.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="222"/>
 I may go a step farther, and truly say, that as such vast Powers cannot be generally granted to all who happen to succeed in any Familys without evident danger of utter Destruction, when they come to be executed by children, women, fools, vicious, incapable or wicked persons, they can be reasonably granted to none, because no man knows what any one will prove till he be try'd; and the importance of the Affair requires such a trial as can be made of no man till he be dead. He that resists one Temptation may fall under the Power of another; and nothing is more common in the world, than to see those men fail grosly in the last actions of their lives, who had pass'd their former days without reproach: Wise and good men will with <HI>Moses</HI> say of themselves, <HI>I cannot bear the burden;</HI> and every man who is concern'd for the publick Good, ought to let fools know they are not fit to undergo it, and by Law to restrain the fury of such as will not be guided by reason. This could not be deny'd, tho Governments were constituted for the good of the Governor. 'Tis good for him that the Law appoints helps for his Infirmitys, and restrains his Vices: but all Nations ought to do it tho it were not so, in as much as Kingdoms are not establish'd for the good of one man, but of the People; and that King who seeks his own good before that of the People, departs from the end of his Institution.</P>
<P>This is so plain, that all Nations who have acted freely, have some way or other endeavour'd to supply the defects, or restrain the vices of their supreme Magistrats; and those among them deserve most praise, who by appointing means adequate to so great a work, have taken care that it might be easily and safely accomplish'd: Such Nations have always flourish'd in Vertue, Power, Glory, and Happiness, whilst those who wanted their Wisdom, have suffer'd all manner of Calamitys by the weakness or injustice of their Princes, or have had their hands perpetual∣ly in Blood to preserve themselves from their fury. We need no better example of the first, than that of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who by appointing such Limits to the power of their Kings as could hardly be transgrest, conti∣nu'd many Ages in great union with them, and were never troubled with civil Tumults. The like may be said of the <HI>Romans</HI> from the expulsion of the <HI>Tarquins,</HI> till they overthrew their own Orders, by continuing <HI>Marius</HI> for five years in the Consulat, whereas the Laws did not permit a man to hold the same Office two years together; and when that rule was broken, their own Magistrats grew too strong for them, and subver∣ted the Commonwealth. When this was done, and the power came into the hands of one man, all manner of evils and calamitys broke in like a flood: 'Tis hard to judg, whether the mischiefs he did, or those he suffer'd were the greater. He who set up himself to be Lord of the World, was like to a Beast crown'd for the slaughter, and his greatness was the forerunner of his ruin. By this means some of those who seem not to have bin naturally prone to evil, were by their fears put upon such courses to preserve themselves, as being rightly estimated, were worse than the death they apprehended: and the so much celebrated <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great dy'd no less polluted with the Blood of his nearest Relations and Friends, than <HI>Nero</HI> himself. But no place can show a more lively <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>picture of this, than the Kingdoms of <HI>Granada,</HI> and others possest by the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> where there being neither Senate nor Assemblys of the Nobility and People, to restrain the violence and fury of their Kings, they had no other way than to kill them when their vices became insup∣portable; which happening for the most part, they were almost all mur∣der'd;
<PB N="219" REF="223"/>
and things were brought to such extremity, that no man would accept a Crown, except he who had neither Birth nor Vertue to de∣serve it.</P>
<P>If it be said that Kings have now found out more easy ways of doing what they please, and securing themselves; I answer, that they have not prov'd so to all, and it is not yet time for such as tread in the same steps to boast of their success: many have fallen when they thought their designs accomplish'd; and no man, as long as he lives, can reasonably assure himself the like shall not befal him. But if in this corrupted Age, the treachery and perjury of Princes be more common than formerly; and the number of those who are brought to delight in the rewards of injustice, be so increas'd, that their partys are stronger than formerly: this rather shows that the balance of Power is broken, or hard to be kept up, than that there ought to be none; and 'tis difficult for any man, without the Spirit of Prophecy, to tell what this will produce. Whilst the antient Constitutions of our Northern Kingdoms remain'd intire, such as contested with their Princes, sought only to reform the Governments, and by re∣dressing what was amiss, to reduce them to their first Principles; but they may not perhaps be so modest, when they see the very nature of their Government chang'd, and the foundations overthrown. I am not sure that they who were well pleas'd with a moderate Monarchy, will submit to one that is absolute; and 'tis not improbable, that when men see there is no medium between Tyranny and Popularity, they who would have bin contented with the reformation of their Government, may proceed farther, and have recourse to Force, when there is no help in the Law. This will be a hard work in those places where Vertue is wholly abolish'd; but the difficulty will lie on the other side, if any sparks of that remain: if Vice and Corruption prevail, Liberty cannot subsist; but if Vertue has the advantage, arbitrary Power cannot be establish'd. Those who boast of their <HI>Loyalty,</HI> and think they give testimonys of it, when they addict themselves to the will of one Man, tho contrary to the Law from whence that Quality is deriv'd, may consider, that by putting their Masters upon illegal courses, they certainly make them the worst of men, and bring them into danger of being also the most miserable. Few or no good Princes have fallen into disasters, unless thro an extremity of corrup∣tion introduc'd by the most wicked; and cannot properly be call'd unhap∣py, if they perish'd in their Innocence; since the bitterness of Death is assuag'd by the tears of a loving People, the assurance of a glorious me∣mory, and the quiet of a well-satisfy'd mind. But of those who have abandon'd themselves to all manner of Vice, follow'd the impulse of their own fury, and set themselves to destroy the best men for opposing their pernicious designs, very few have dy'd in peace. Their Lives have bin miserable, Death infamous, and Memory detestable.</P>
<P>They therefore who place Kings within the power of the Law, and the Law to be a guide to Kings, equally provide for the good of King and People: Whereas they who admit of no participants in power, and ac∣knowledg no rule but their own Will, set up an interest in themselves against that of their People, lose their affections, which is their most im∣portant Treasure, and incur their hatred, from whence results their greatest danger.</P>

<HEAD> SECT. XXXI. The Libertys of Nations are from God and Nature, not from Kings.</HEAD>
<P>WHatsoever is usually said in opposition to this, seems to proceed from a groundless conceit, that the Libertys enjoy'd by Nations arise from the Concessions of Princes. This point has bin already treated: but being the foundation of the Doctrin I oppose, it may not be amiss far∣ther to examin how it can be possible for one man, born under the same condition with the rest of Mankind, to have a Right in himself that is not common to all others, till it be by them or a certain number of them confer'd upon him; or how he can without the utmost absurdity be said to grant Libertys and Privileges to them who made him to be what he is.</P>
<P>If I had to do with a man that sought after Truth, I should think he had bin led into this extravagant opinion by the terms ordinarily us'd in Patents and Charters granted to particular men; and not distinguishing between the Proprietor and the Dispenser, might think Kings had given, as their own, that which they only distribute out of the publick Treasury, and could have had nothing to distribute by parcels, if it had not bin given to them in gross by the Publick. But I need not use our Author so gently. The perversity of his judgment, and obstinate hatred to Truth, is sufficient to draw him into the most absurd errors, without any other inducement; and it were not charity, but folly to think otherwise of one who attributes in general to all Princes, without any regard to the ways by which they attain to their Power, such an Authority as never justly belong'd to any.</P>
<P>This will be evident to all those who consider, that no man can confer upon others that which he has not in himself: If he be originally no more than they, he cannot grant to them or any of them more than they to him. In the 7<HI>th,</HI> 8<HI>th,</HI> 9<HI>th,</HI> and subsequent Sections of the first Chapter, it has bin prov'd that there is no resemblance between the paternal Right, and the absolute Power which he asserts in Kings: that the right of a Father, whatever it be, is only over his Children; that this right is equally inherited by them all when he dies: that every one cannot in∣herit Dominion; for the right of one would be inconsistent with that of all others: that the right which is common to all is that which we call Li∣berty, or exemption from Dominion: that the first Fathers of Mankind after the Flood had not the exercise of Regal Power; and whatsoever they had was equally devolv'd to every one of their Sons, as appears by the examples of <HI>Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</HI> and their Children: that the erection of <HI>Nimrod</HI>'s Kingdom was directly contrary to, and in∣consistent with the paternal right, if there was any regality in it: that the other Kingdoms of that time were of the same nature: that <HI>Nimrod</HI> not exceeding the age of threescore years when he built <HI>Babel,</HI> could not be the Father of those that assisted him in that attempt: that if the seventy two Kings, who, as our Author says, went from <HI>Babylon</HI> upon the con∣susion of Languages, were not the Sons of <HI>Nimrod,</HI> he could not govern them by the right of a Father; if they were, they must have bin very voung, and could not have Children of their own to people the Kingdoms they set up: that whose Children soever they were, who out of a part of
<PB N="221" REF="225"/>
Mankind did within a hundred and thirty two years after the Flood, di∣vide into so many Kingdoms, they shew'd that others in process of time might subdivide into as many as they pleas'd; and Kingdoms multiply∣ing in the space of four thousand years since the 72, in the same proporti∣on they did in one hundred and thirty two years into seventy two, there would now be as many Kings in the World as there are men; that is, no man could be subject to another: that this equality of Right and exemption from the domination of any other, is call'd Liberty: that he who enjoys it cannot be depriv'd of it, unless by his own consent, or by force: that no one man can force a Multitude, or if he did, it could con∣fer no right upon him: that a Multitude consenting to be govern'd by one man, dos confer upon him the power of governing them; the pow∣ers therefore that he has, are from them, and they who have all in themselves can receive nothing from him, who has no more than every one of them, till they do invest him with it. This is prov'd by sacred and profane Historys. The <HI>Hebrews</HI> in the creation of Judges, Kings, or other Magistrats, had no regard to Paternity, or to any who by ex∣traction could in the least pretend to the right of Fathers: God did never direct them to do it, nor reprove them for neglecting it: If they would chuse a King, he commanded them to take one of their Brethren, not one who call'd himself their Father: When they did resolve to have one, he commanded them to chuse him by lot, and caus'd the Lot to fall upon a young man of the youngest Tribe: <HI>David</HI> and the other Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> or <HI>Judah</HI> had no more to say for themselves in that point than <HI>Saul:</HI> All the Kings of that Nation before and after the Captivity, ordinarily or extra∣ordinarily set up, justly or unjustly, were rais'd without regard to any Pre∣rogative they could claim or arrogate to themselves on that account. All that they had therefore was from their elevation, and their elevation from those that elevated them: 'Twas impossible for them to confer any thing upon those from whom they receiv'd all they had; or for the People to give power to Kings, if they had not had it in themselves; which Power universally residing in every one, is that which we call Liberty. The method of other Nations was much like to this. They plac'd those in the Throne who seem'd best to deserve so great an Honour, and most able to bear so great a Burden: The Kingdoms of the Heroes were nothing else but the Government of those who were most beneficent to the Nations amongst whom they liv'd, and whose Vertues were thought fit to be rais'd above the ordinary level of the World. Tho perhaps there was not any one <HI>Athenian</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> equal to <HI>Theseus</HI> or <HI>Romulus</HI> in courage and strength, yet they were not able to subdue many: or if any man should be so vain to think that each of them did at first subdue one man, then two, and so proceeding by degrees conquer'd a whole People, he cannot without madness ascribe the same to <HI>Numa,</HI> who being sent for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom a soreign Country, was immediately made King of a fierce People, that had already conquer'd many of their Neighbours, and was grown too boisterous even for <HI>Romulus</HI> himself. The like may be said of the first <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and of <HI>Servius;</HI> they were Strangers: and tho <HI>Tullus Hostilius</HI> and <HI>Ancus Martius</HI> were <HI>Romans,</HI> they had as little title to a Dominion over their Fellow-Citizens, or means of attaining to it, as if they had come srom the farthest parts of the Earth. This must be in all places, unless one man could prove by a perfect and uninterrupted Genealogy, that he is the eldest Son of the eldest Line of <HI>Noah,</HI> and that Line to have

But if our Author can perform this for the service of any man, I willingly surrender my Arms, and yield up the Cause I defend. If he fail, 'tis ridiculous to pretend a Right that belongs to no man, or to go about to retrieve a Right which for the space of four thousand years has lain dormant; and much more to create that which never had a subsistence. This leads us necessarily to a conclusion, That all Kingdoms are at the first erected by the consent of Nations, and given to whom they please; or else all are set up by force, or some by force, and some by consent: If any are set up by the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of Nations, their Kings do not confer Libertys upon those Nations, but re∣ceive all from them, and the general Proposition is false. If our Author therefore, or his Followers, would confute me, they must prove that all the Kingdoms of the World have their beginning from force, and that Force dos always create a Right; or if they recede from the general Pro∣position, and attribute a peculiar right to one or more Princes, who are so absolute Lords of their People, that those under them have neither Li∣berty, Privilege, Property or Part in the Government, but by their Con∣cessions, they must prove that those Princes did by force gain the Power they have, and that their Right is deriv'd from it. This Force also must have bin perpetually continu'd; for if that force be the root of the Right that is pretended, another force by the same rule may overturn, extinguish or transfer it to another hand. If Contracts have interven'd, the force ceases; and the Right that afterwards dos accrue to the persons, must proceed from, and be regulated according to those Contracts.</P>
<P>This may be sufficient to my purpose: For having already prov'd, that the Kingdoms of <HI>Israel, Judah, Rome, Sparta, France, Spain, England,</HI> and all that we are concern'd in, or that deserve to be examples to us, did arise from the consent of the respective Nations, and were frequently re∣duc'd to their first Principles, when the Princes have endeavour'd to transgress the Laws of their Institution; it could be nothing to us, tho <HI>Attila</HI> or <HI>Tamerlan</HI> had by force gain'd the Dominions they possest. But I dare go a step further, and boldly assert, that there never was or can be a man in the world that did, or can subdue a Nation; and that the right of one grounded upon force, is a mere whimsy. It was not <HI>Agathocles, Dionysius, Nabis, Marius, Sylla</HI> or <HI>Cesar,</HI> but the mercenary Soldiers, and other Villains that join'd with them, who subdu'd the <HI>Syracusans, Spar∣tans,</HI> or <HI>Romans:</HI> And as the work was not perform'd by those Tyrants alone, if a right had bin gain'd by the violence they us'd, it must have bin common to all those that gain'd it; and he that commanded them could have had no more than they thought fit to conser upon him. When <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE><HI>Miltiades</HI> desir'd leave to wear an Olive Garland, in commemoration of the Victory obtain'd at <HI>Marathon,</HI> an <HI>Athenian</HI> did in my opinion rightly say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If you alone did fight against the <HI>Persians,</HI> it is just that you only should be crown'd; but if others did participate in the Victory, they ought also to have a part in the Honor."</Q> And the principal difference that I have observ'd between the most regular proceedings of the wisest Senats or Assemblys of the people in their Persons or Delegats, and the sury of the most dissolute Villains, has bin, that the first seeking the publick good, do usually set up such a Man, and invest him with such Powers as seem most conducing to that Good: whereas the others follow∣ing
<PB N="223" REF="227"/>
the impulse of a bestial rage, and aiming at nothing but the satisfacti∣on of their own lusts, always advance one from whom they expect the greatest advantages to themselves, and give him such Powers as most con∣duce to the accomplishment of their own ends: but as to the Person 'tis the same thing. <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Nero</HI> did no more make themselves what they were, than <HI>Numa;</HI> and could no more confer any Right, Liberty or Privilege upon the Army that gave them all they had, than the most regu∣lar Magistrate could upon the Senat or People that chose him.</P>
<P>This also is common to the worst as well as the best, that they who set up either, do, as into a publick Treasury, confer upon the Person they chuse, a Power of distributing to particular men, or numbers of men, such Honors, Privileges and Advantages, as they may seem, according to the Principles of the Government, to deserve. But there is this diffe∣rence, that the ends of the one being good, and those of the other evil, the first do for the most part limit the Powers, that something may remain to reward Services done to the Publick, in a manner proportion'd to the merit of every one; placing other Magistrats to see it really perform'd, so as they may not, by the weakness or vices of the Governor, be turn'd to the publick detriment: the others think they never give enough, that the Prince having all in his Power, may be able to gratify their most exor∣bitant desires, if by any ways they can get his favour; and his infirmi∣tys and vices being most beneficial to them, they seldom allow to any o∣ther Magistrate a power of opposing his Will, or suffer those who for the publick good would assume it. The World affords many examples of both sorts, and every one of them have had their progress sutable to their Constitution. The regular Kingdoms of <HI>England, France, Spain, Po∣land, Bohemia, Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and others, whether elective or here∣ditary, have had High Stewards, Constables, Mayors of the Palace, Rixhofmeisters, Parliaments, Diets, Assemblys of Estates, Cortez, and the like, by which those have bin admitted to succeed who seem'd most fit for the publick Service; the unworthy have bin rejected; the infir∣mitys of the weak supply'd; the malice of the unjust restrain'd; and when necessity requir'd, the Crown transfer'd from one Line or Family to another. But in the furious Tyrannys that have bin set up by the vio∣lence of a corrupted Soldiery, as in the antient <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the King∣doms of the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> the Tyrannys of <HI>Ezzelino</HI> of <HI>Padoa,</HI> those of the <HI>Visconti</HI> and <HI>Sforzeschi</HI> of <HI>Milan, Castruccio Castraccani</HI> of <HI>Lucca, Cesar Borgia,</HI> and others, there was nothing of all this. The Will of the Prince was a Law; all Power was in him, and he kept it, till ano∣ther stept up and took it from him, by the same means that he had gain'd it. This fell out so frequently, that tho all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors endea∣vour'd to make their Power hereditary, it hardly continu'd three Gene∣rations in one Line from <HI>Augustus</HI> to <HI>Augustulus,</HI> unless in that of <HI>Constan∣tine,</HI> and that with extreme confusion and disorder. They who had madly set up a Man to be their Head, and expos'd so much of the World as was under their power, to be destroy'd by him, did by the like fury throw him down, and never ceas'd till they had brought the Empire to utter ruin.</P>
<P>But if this paternal Sovereignty be a mere fiction that never had any effect; and no Nation was ever commanded by God to make it their rule, nor any reprov'd for the neglect of it; none ever learnt it from the light of nature, nor were by wise men taught to regard it: If the first Fathers claim'd no Privilege from it when every man's Genealogy was

 known; and tho there were such a thing in nature, it could be of no use at this day, when the several Races of men are so confus'd, that not one in the world can prove his own Original: If the first Kingdoms, whether well or ill constituted, according to the Command of God, or the Inventions of Men, were contrary to, and incompatible with it; and there can have bin no justice in any, if such a Rule was to have bin observ'd; the continuance of an unjust usurpation can never have created a Right, but aggravated the in∣justice of overthrowing it: If no man could ever by his own strength and courage subdue a multitude, nor gain any other right over them, if he did, than they might have to tear it from him; Whoever denies King∣doms or other Magistracys to have bin set up by men, according to their own will, and from an opinion of receiving benefit by them, accuses all the Governments that are, or ever have bin in the world, of that outra∣geous injustice in their Foundation which can never be repair'd. If there be therefore, or ever was any just Government amongst men, it was consti∣tuted by them; and whether their Proceedings were regular or violent, just or unjust, the Powers annex'd to it were their Donation: The Magistracys erected by them, whether in one or more men, temporary or perpetual, elective or hereditary, were their Creatures; and receiving all from them, could confer nothing upon them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXII. The Contracts made between Magistrats, and the Nations that created them, were real, solemn, and obligatory.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author having with big words and little sense inveigh'd a∣gainst Popular and Mix'd Governments, proceeds as if he had prov'd that they could not, or ought not to be. <HI>If it be,</HI> says he, <HI>unna∣tural for the Multitude to chuse their Governors, or to govern, or to par∣take in the Government; what can be thought of that damnable Conclusion which is made by too many, that the Multitude may correct or depose their Princes, if need be? Surely the unnaturalness and injustice of this Position cannot sufficiently be exprest. For admit that a King make a Contract or Paction with his People originally in his Ancestors, or personally at his Coro∣nation (for both these Pactions some dream of, but cannot offer any proof of either) yet by no Law of any Nation can a Contract be thought broken, except first a lawful trial be had by the ordinary Judg of the breakers thereof; or else every man may be both Party and Judg in his own case, which is absurd once to be thought: for then it will lie in the hands of the headless multitude, when they please, to cast off the Yoke of Government that God has laid upon them, and to judg and punish him, by whom they should be judg'd and punish'd them∣selves.</HI> To this I answer first briefly, That if it be natural for the Mul∣titude to chuse their Governors, or to govern, or to participate of the Government as best pleases themselves; or that there never was a Govern∣ment in the World that was not so set up by them, in pursuance of the Power naturally inherent in themselves; what can be thought of that damnable Conclusion, which has bin made by Fools or Knaves, That the Multitude may not, if need be, correct or depose their own Magistrats? Surely the unnaturalness and injustice of such a Position cannot be suffi∣ciently exprest. If that were admitted, all the most solemn Pacts and
<PB N="225" REF="229"/>
Contracts made between Nations and their Magistrats, originally or per∣sonally, and confirm'd by Laws and mutual Oaths, would be of no value. He that would break the most sacred Bonds that can be amongst men, should by perjury and wickedness become Judg of his own case, and by the worst of crimes procure impunity for all. It would be in his power, by folly, wickedness and madness, to destroy the Multitude which he was created and sworn to preserve, tho wise, vertuous and just, and headed by the wisest and justest of men; or to lay a Yoke upon those who by the Laws of God and Nature ought to be free: He might in his own case judg that Body by which he ought to be judg'd; and who in considera∣tion of themselves and their own good, made him to be whatsoever he is more than every one of them: The Governments instituted for the pre∣servation of Nations, would turn to their destruction: It would be im∣possible to check the fury of a corrupt and perfidious Magistrate: The worst of men would be rais'd to a height that was never deserv'd by the best; and the assurance of indemnity would, by increasing their inso∣lence, turn their other vices into madness, as has bin too often seen in those who have had more power than they deserv'd, and were more hardly brought to account for their actions than ought to have bin; tho I never heard of any who had so much as our Author asserts to be in all, nor that any was absolutely assur'd he should not be question'd for the abuse of what he had.</P>
<P>Besides, if every People may govern, or constitute and chuse one or more Governors, they may divide the Powers between several Men, or ranks of men, allotting to every one so much as they please, or retaining so much as they think fit. This has bin prac∣tis'd in all the Governments, which under several forms have flou∣rish'd in <HI>Palestine, Greece, Italy, Germany, France, England,</HI> and the rest of the World. The Laws of every place show what the Power of the respective Magistrate is, and by declaring how much is allow'd to him, declare what is deny'd; for he has not that which he has not, and is to be accounted a Magistrate whilst he exercises that which he has.</P>
<P>If any doubts do hereupon arise, I hope to remove them, proving in the first place, that several Nations have plainly and explicitly made Con∣tracts with their Magistrats.</P>
<P>2. That they are implicit, and to be understood, where they are not plainly exprest.</P>
<P>3. That they are not dreams, but real things, and perpetually obliging.</P>
<P>4. That Judges are in many places appointed to decide the Contests arising from the breach of these Contracts; and where they are not, or the party offending is of such force or pride that he will not submit, Na∣tions have bin oblig'd to take the extremest courses.</P>
<P>To the first: I suppose it will not be deny'd, that the annual Magi∣strats of divers Commonwealths are under some Compact, and that there is a power of constraining them to perform the contents, or to punish them for the violation. The modest behaviour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Consuls and Dictators (as long as their Laws were in force) might not probably proceed from their good nature. Tho the people had not bin, as our Au∣thor says, <HI>mad, foolish, and always desirous to chuse the worst men for being most like to themselves,</HI> but admirably wise and vertuous, 'tis not to be imagin'd that in the space of three or four hundred years they should never have fallen upon one who would have transgrest, if he could have done it safely, tho they had us'd the utmost caution in their choice.
<PB N="226" REF="230"/>
 But the power of the Consuls being only for a year, that of the Dictator for six months at most, and the Commission that he should take care <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ne quid detrimenti Respubl. accipiat.</NOTE>the Commonwealth might suffer no damage, show the end and con∣dition upon which they were chosen; and tho their Power is by some thought to have bin absolute, yet the Consuls were frequently oppos'd and brought into order by the Senat, Tribuns, or People, and some∣times <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. Vit. Camil.</NOTE>the Dictator himself. <HI>Camillus</HI> in his fourth Dictatorship was threa∣ten'd by the Tribuns with a great Fine, and by that means oblig'd to ab∣dicate his Magistracy. I have already mention'd <HI>Marcus Fabius Maximus,</HI> who in the behalf of his Son <HI>Quintus</HI> condemn'd to die by <HI>Papirius</HI> the Dictator, appeal'd to the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Qui solus plus quam rua Dictatura potest pollet{que} cui &amp; reges cessere, &amp;c. <BIBL>T. Liv. l. <HI>8.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>People: And when the Conduct of <HI>Fabius</HI> in the War against <HI>Hannibal</HI> was not approv'd, the Tribun thought he made a very modest Proposition, in that he did not desire his Magistracy should be abrogated; but that the Master of the Horse should be made equal to him in power, which was done accordingly. 'Tis agreed by all, that the Consuls were in the place of Kings, and that the Power of the Dictator was at least equal to what theirs had bin. If they there∣fore were under such a rule, which they could not transgress, or might be reduc'd to order if they did, and forc'd to submit to the People, as the Kings had done, the Kings were also made upon the same conditions, and equally oblig'd to perform them.</P>
<P>The Scripture is more clear in the case. The Judges are said to have bin in power equal to Kings; and I may perhaps ackowledg it, with re∣lation to the Deuteronomical King, or such as the People might have chosen without offending God. The <HI>Gileadites</HI> made a Covenant with <HI>Jephtha,</HI> that he should be their Head and Captain: He would not return to his Country till they had done it. This was perform'd solemnly be∣fore the Lord in <HI>Mispeth,</HI> and all <HI>Israel</HI> follow'd them. They might therefore make a Covenant with their Kings, for the difference of name dos not increase or diminish the Right. Nay, they were in duty oblig'd to do it: The words of the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deuter. He shall not multiply Wives, &amp;c. that his Heart be not lifted up above his Brethren,</HI> can have no other signi∣fication, than that they should take care he did it not, or, as <HI>Josephus</HI> says, hinder him if he attempt it; for the Law was not given to the King who was not, but those who might make him if they thought fit.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. </HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Kings not being Fathers of their People, nor excelling all others in Ver∣tue, can have no other just Power than what the Laws give; nor any title to the privileges of the Lord's Anointed.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING prov'd that the right of Fathers is from Nature, and incommunicable, it must follow, that every man dos per∣petually owe all love, respect, service, and obedience to him that did beget, nourish, and educate him, and to no other un∣der that name. No man therefore can claim the right of a Father over any, except one that is so; no man can serve two Masters; the extent and perpetuity of the Duty which every man owes to his Father, ren∣ders it impossible for him to owe the same to any other: This right of Father cannot be devolv'd to the Heir of the Father, otherwise than as every Son by the Law of Nature is Heir to his Father, and has the same right of commanding his Children, as his Father had of commanding him when he was a Child: no man can owe to his Brother that which he ow'd to his Father, because he cannot receive that from him which he had from his Father: but the utmost of all absurditys that can enter into the Heart of man is, for one to exact the rights due to a Father, who has no other title than force and usurpation, it being no less than to say, that I owe as much to one who has done me the greatest of all Injurys, as to him who has confer'd upon me the greatest Benefits: or, which is yet worse, if possible, that as these usurpations cannot be made but by rob∣bing, spoiling, imprisoning, or killing the Person in possession; that Duty, which by the eternal Law of Nature I owe to my Father, should oblige me to pay the same veneration, obedience, and service, to the man that has spoil'd, imprison'd, or kill'd my Father, as I ow'd to him; or that the same Law which oblig'd me to obey and defend my Father, be∣cause he was so, should oblige me to obey and defend his enemy, because he has imprison'd or kill'd him; and not only to pass over the Law of God, which makes me the avenger of my Father's Blood, but to re∣ward his Murderer with the rights that comprehend all that is most tender and sacred in Nature, and to look upon one that has done me the greatest of all injustices and injurys, as upon him to whom I owe my Birth and Education. This being evident to all those who have any measure of common sense, I suppose it may be safely concluded, that what right soever a Father may have over his Family, it cannot relate to that which a King has over his People; unless he, like the man in the Island of <HI>Pines,</HI> mention'd before, be also the Father of them all. That which is
<PB N="228" REF="232"/>
 absolutely unlike in manner and substance, institution and exercise, must be unlike in all respects; and the Conclusions, which have their strength from Similitude and Parity, can have none when there is not the least similitude of either. And tho it were true, that Fathers are held by no contracts, (which generally 'tis not; for when the Son is of age, and dos something for the Father to which he is not oblig'd, or gives him that which he is not bound to give, suppose an Inheritance receiv'd from a Friend, goods of his own acquisition, or that he be emancipated, all good Laws look upon those things as a valuable consideration, and give the same force to contracts thereupon made, as to those that pass between strangers) it could have no relation to our question concerning Kings. One prin∣cipal reason that renders it very little necessary by the Laws of Nations, to restrain the power of Parents over their Children is, because 'tis pre∣sum'd they cannot abuse it: they are thought to have a Law in their Bowels, obliging them more strictly to seek their good, than all those that can be laid upon them by another Power; and yet if they depart from it, so as inhumanly to abuse or kill their Children, they are punish'd with as much rigor, and accounted more unpardonable than other men. Igno∣rance or wilful malice persuading our Author to pass over all this, he bold∣ly affirms, <HI>That the Father of a Family governs it by no other Law than his own Will;</HI> and from thence infers, that the condition of Kings is the same. He would seem to soften the harshness of this Proposition by saying, <HI>That a King is always ty'd by the same Law of Nature to keep this general ground, that the safety of the Kingdom is his chief Law.</HI> But he spoils it in the next page, by asserting, <HI>That it is not right for Kings to do injury, but it is right that they go unpunish'd by the People, if they do; so that in this point it is all one, whether</HI> Samuel <HI>describe a King or a Tyrant, for patient obedience is due un∣to both; no remedy in the Text against Tyrants, but crying and praying unto God in that day.</HI> In this our Author, according to the custom of Thea∣ters, runs round in a Circle, pretends to grant that which is true, and then by a lie endeavours to destroy all again. Kings by the Law of Na∣ture are oblig'd to seek chiefly the good of the Kingdom; but there is no remedy if they do it not: which is no less than to put all upon the Con∣science of those who manifestly have none. But if God has appointed that all other transgressions of the Laws of Nature, by which a private man receives damage, should be punish'd in this world, notwithstanding the right reserv'd to himself of a future punishment; I desire to know, why this alone, by which whole Nations may be, and often are destroy'd, should escape the hands of Justice? If he presume no Law to be necessary in this case, because it cannot be thought that Kings will transgress, as there was no Law in <HI>Sparta</HI> against Adultery, because it was not thought possible for men educated under that disciplin, to be guilty of such a Crime; and as divers Nations left a liberty to Fathers to dispose of their Children as they thought fit, because it could not be imagin'd that any one would abuse that power; he ought to remember that the <HI>Spartans</HI> were mistaken, and for want of that Law which they esteem'd useless, Adul∣terys became as common there as in any part of the world: and the other error being almost every where discover'd, the Laws of all civiliz'd Na∣tions make it capital for a man to kill his Children; and give redress to Children, if they suffer any other extreme injurys from their Parents, as well as to other persons. But tho this were not so, it would be nothing to our question, unless it could be suppos'd, that whoever gets the power of a Nation into his hands, must be immediately fill'd with the same tender∣ness
<PB N="229" REF="233"/>
of affection to the People under him, as a Father naturally has to∣wards the Children he has begotten. He that is of this opinion, may examin the lives of <HI>Herod, Tiberius, Caligula,</HI> and some later Princes of like inclinations, and conclude it to be true, if he find that the whole course of their actions, in relation to the People under them, do well sute with the tender and sacred name of Father; and altogether false, if he find the contrary. But since every man that considers what has bin, or sees what is every day done in the world, must confess, that Princes, or those who govern them, do most frequently so utterly reject all thoughts of tenderness and piety towards the Nations under them, as rather to seek what can be drawn from them, than what should be done for them, and sometimes become their most bitter and publick enemys; 'tis ridiculous to make the safety of Nations to depend upon a supposition, which by daily experience we find to be false; and impious, to prefer the lusts of a man who violates the most sacred Laws of Nature, by destroying those he is oblig'd to preserve, before the welfare of that People for whose good he is made to be what he is, if there be any thing of justice in the Power he exercises.</P>
<P>Our Author foolishly thinks to cover the enormity of this nonsense, by turning <HI>Salutem Populi</HI> into <HI>Salutem Regni:</HI> for tho <HI>Regnum</HI> may be taken for the power of commanding, in which sense the preservation of it is the usual object of the care of Princes, yet it dos more rightly signify the Body of that Nation which is govern'd by a King. And therefore if the Maxim be true, as he acknowledges it to be, then <HI>Salus Populi est Lex suprema;</HI> and the first thing we are to inquire is, whether the Government of this or that man dos conduce to the accomplishment of that supreme Law, or not; for otherwise it ought to have bin said, <HI>Salus Regis est Lex suprema,</HI> which certainly never enter'd into the head of a wiser or better man than <HI>Filmer.</HI></P>
<P>His Reasons are as good as his Doctrin: <HI>No Law,</HI> says he, <HI>can be im∣pos'd on Kings, because there were Kings before any Laws were made.</HI> This would not follow, tho the Proposition were true; for they, who impos'd no Laws upon the Kings they at first made, from an opinion of their Vertue, as in those call'd by the Antients <HI>Heroum regna,</HI> might lay re∣strictions upon them, when they were found not to answer the expecta∣tion conceiv'd of them, or that their Successors degenerated from their Vertue. Other Nations also being instructed by the ill effects of an un∣limited Power given to some Kings (if there was any such) might wise∣ly avoid the Rock upon which their Neighbours had split, and justly mo∣derate that Power which had bin pernicious to others. However a Pro∣position of so great importance ought to be prov'd; but that being hard, and perhaps impossible, because the original of Nations is almost wholly unknown to us, and their practice seems to have bin so various, that what is true in one is not so in another; he is pleas'd only to affirm it, without giving the least shadow of a reason to persuade us to believe him. This might justify me, if I should reject his assertion as a thing said <HI>gratis:</HI> but I may safely go a step farther, and affirm, That men liv'd under Laws before there were any Kings; which cannot be deny'd, if such a Power necessarily belongs to Kings as he ascribes to them. For <HI>Nimrod,</HI> who establish'd his Kingdom in <HI>Babel,</HI> is the first who by the Scripture is said to have bin a mighty one in the Earth. He was therefore the first King, or Kings were not mighty; and he being the first King, Mankind must have liv'd till his time without Laws, or else Laws were made before
<PB N="230" REF="234"/>
 Kings. To say that there was then no Law, is in many respects most absurd; for the Nature of man cannot be without it, and the violences committed by ill men before the Flood, could not have bin blam'd if there had bin no Law; for that which is not, cannot be transgrest. <HI>Cain</HI> could not have fear'd that every man who met him would slay him, if there had not bin a Law to slay him that had slain another. But in this case the Scripture is clear, at least from the time that <HI>Noah</HI> went out of the Ark; for God then gave him a Law sufficient for the state of things at that time, if all violence was prohibited under the name of shedding Blood, tho not under the same penalty as Murder. But Penal Laws be∣ing in vain, if there be none to execute them, such as know God dos nothing in vain, may conclude that he who gave this Law, did appoint some way for its execution, tho unknown to us. There is therefore a Law not given by Kings, but laid upon such as should be Kings, as well as on any other Persons, by one who is above them; and perhaps I may say, that this Law presses most upon them, because they who have most power, do most frequently break out into acts of Violence, and most of all disdain to have their Will re∣strain'd: and he that will exempt Kings from this Law, must either find that they are excepted in the Text, or that God who gave it has not a Power over them.</P>
<P>Moreover, it has bin prov'd at the beginning of this Treatise, that the first Kings were of the accursed race, and reign'd over the accursed Nations, whilst the holy Seed had none. If therefore there was no Law where there was no King, the accursed Posterity of <HI>Cham</HI> had Laws, when the blessed Descendents of <HI>Shem</HI> had none, which is most absurd; the word <HI>Outlaw</HI> or <HI>Lawless,</HI> being often given to the wicked, but never to the just and righteous.</P>
<P>The impious folly of such Assertions goes farther than our Author per∣haps suspected: for if there be no Law where there is no King, the <HI>Israe∣lites</HI> had no Law till <HI>Saul</HI> was made King, and then the Law they had was from him. They had no King before, for they ask'd one. They could not have ask'd one of <HI>Samuel,</HI> if he had bin a King. He had not bin offend∣ed, and God had not imputed to them the sin of rejecting him, if they had ask'd that only which he had set over them. If <HI>Samuel</HI> were not King, <HI>Moses, Joshua,</HI> and the other Judges were not Kings; for they were no more than he. They had therefore no King, and consequently, if our Author says true, no Law. If they had no Law till <HI>Saul</HI> was King, they never had any; for he gave them none; and the Prophets were to blame for denouncing judgments against them for receding from, or breaking their Law, if they had none. He cannot say that <HI>Samuel</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 10.</NOTE>gave them a Law; for that which he wrote in a Book, and laid up be∣fore the Lord, was not a Law to the People, but to the King. If it had bin a Law to the People, it must have bin made publick; but as it was only to the King, he laid it up before God, to testify against him if he should adventure to break it. Or if it was a Law to the People, the matter is not mended; for it was given in the time of a King by one who was not King. But in truth it was the Law of the Kingdom by which he was King, and had bin wholly impertinent, if it was not to bind him; for it was given to no other person, and to no other end.</P>
<P>Our Author's Assertion on which all his Doctrin is grounded, <HI>That there is no Nation that allows Children any action or remedy for being unjustly go∣vern'd,</HI> is as impudently false as any other propos'd by him: for tho a Child
<PB N="231" REF="235"/>
will not be heard that complains of the Rod; yet our own Law gives relief to Children against their Fathers, as well as against other persons that do them injurys, upon which we see many ill effects, and I do rather relate than commend the practice. In other places the Law gives relief against the extravagances of which Fathers may be guilty in relation to their Children, tho not to that excess as to bring them so near to an equality as in <HI>England:</HI> They cannot imprison, sell, or kill their Chil∣dren, without exposing themselves to the same punishments with other men; and if they take their Estates from them, the Law is open, and gives relief against them: but on the other side, Children are punish'd with Death, if they strike or outrageously abuse their Parents; which is not so with us.</P>
<P>Now, if the Laws of Nations take such care to preserve private men from being too hardly us'd by their true and natural Fathers, who have such a love and tenderness for them in their own Blood, that the most wicked and barbarous do much more frequently commit crimes for them than against them; how much more necessary is it to restrain the fury that Kings, who at the best are but phantastical Fathers, may exercise to the destruction of the whole People? 'Tis a folly to say that <HI>David</HI> and some other Kings have had, or that all should have as tender an affection towards their People as towards their Children; for besides that even the first Proposition is not acknowledg'd, and will be hard∣ly verify'd in any one instance, there is a vast distance between what men ought to be, and what they are. Every man ought to be just, true and charitable; and if they were so, Laws would be of no use: but it were a madness to abolish them upon a supposition that they are so; or to leave them to a future punishment, which many do not believe, or not regard. I am not oblig'd to believe that <HI>David</HI> lov'd every <HI>Israelite</HI> as well as his Son <HI>Absalom;</HI> but tho he had, I could not from thence infer that all Kings do so, unless I were sure that all of them were as wise and vertuous as he.</P>
<P>But to come more close to the matter: Do we not know of many Kings who have come to their Power by the most wicked means that can enter into the heart of man, even by the most outrageous injurys done to the People, sometimes by a foreign aid? as Kings were by the power of the <HI>Romans</HI> impos'd upon the <HI>Britans,</HI> that they might wast the Forces, and break the Spirits of that fierce people. This <HI>Tacitus</HI> acknowledges, and says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inter instrumenta servitutis reges habuere. <BIBL>Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>That among other instruments of inslaving Nations, they im∣pos'd Kings upon them.</HI> The <HI>Medices</HI> were made Masters of <HI>Florence</HI> by the force of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth's Army. Sometimes by a corrupt party in their own Country they have destroy'd the best men, and subdu'd the rest; as <HI>Agathocles, Dionysius,</HI> and <HI>Cesar</HI> did at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Syracuse.</HI> Others taking upon them to defend a People, have turn'd the Arms with which they were entrusted against their own Masters; as <HI>Francesco Sforza,</HI> who being chosen by those of <HI>Milan</HI> to be their General against the <HI>Venetians,</HI> made peace with them, and by their assistance made himself Prince, or, in our Author's phrase, Father of that great City. If these be acts of ten∣derness, love, justice, and charity, those who commit them may well think they have gain'd the affections of their People, and grow to love those from whom they fear nothing, and by whom they think they are
<PB N="232" REF="236"/>
 lov'd. But if on the other hand they know they have attain'd to their greatness by the worst of all Villanys, and that they are on that account become the object of the publick hatred, they can do no less than hate and fear those by whom they know themselves to be hated. The <HI>Italians</HI> ordinarily say that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chi fa in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uria non perdona mai.</NOTE>he who dos an injury never pardons, because he thinks he is never pardon'd: But he that enslaves and oppresses a People dos an injury which can never be pardon'd, and therefore fears it will be re∣veng'd.</P>
<P>Other Princes who come to their Thrones by better ways, and are not contented with the power that the Law allows, draw the same hatred upon themselves when they endeavour by force or fraud to enlarge it; and must necessarily fear and hate their own People as much as he who by the ways beforemention'd has betray'd or subdu'd them. Our Author makes nothing of this; but taking it for granted that it was all one whether <HI>Samuel</HI> spoke of a King or a Tyrant, declares that the same patient obe∣dience is due to both; but not being pleas'd to give any reason why we should believe him, I intend to offer some why we should not.</P>
<P>First, there is nothing in the nature or institution of Monarchy that obliges Nations to bear the exorbitances of it when it degenerates into Tyranny.</P>
<P>In the second place, we have no precept for it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, we have many approv'd examples, and occasional particular commands to the contrary.</P>
<P>1. To the first: The point of Paternity being explain'd; the duty of Children to Parents prov'd to proceed from the benefits receiv'd from them, and that the power over them, which at the first seems to have bin left at large, because it was thought they would never abuse it, has long since bin much restrain'd in all civiliz'd Nations, and particularly in our own; We may conclude that men are all made of the same paste, and that one ows no more to another than another to him, unless for some benefit re∣ceiv'd, or by virtue of some promise made. The duty arising from a benefit receiv'd must be proportionable to it: that which grows from a promise is determin'd by the promise or contract made, according to the true sense and meaning of it. He therefore that would know what the <HI>Babylonians, Hebrews, Athenians,</HI> or <HI>Romans</HI> did owe to <HI>Nimrod, Saul, Theseus</HI> or <HI>Romulus,</HI> must inquire what benefits were receiv'd from them, or what was promis'd to them. It cannot be said that any thing was due to them for the sake of their Parents; they could have no prerogative by birth: <HI>Nimrod</HI> was the sixth Son of <HI>Chush</HI> the Son of <HI>Cham,</HI> who was the youngest Son of <HI>Noah;</HI> his Kingdom was erected whilst <HI>Noah</HI> and his elder Sons <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> as well as <HI>Cham, Chush</HI> and his elder Sons were still living. <HI>Saul</HI> was the Son of <HI>Chish,</HI> a man of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who was the youngest Son of <HI>Jacob;</HI> and he was chosen in the most Democra∣tical way by Lot amongst the whole People. <HI>Theseus</HI> according to the custom of the times pretended to be the Son of <HI>Neptune;</HI> and <HI>Rhea</HI> was so well pleas'd with the Soldier that had gotten her with child, that she resolv'd to think or say that <HI>Mars</HI> was the Father of the Children, that is to say they were Bastards; and therefore whatever was due to them was
<PB N="233" REF="237"/>
upon their own personal account, without any regard to their Progeni∣tors. This must be measur'd according to what they did for those Na∣tions before they were Kings, or by the manner of their advancement. No∣thing can be pretended before they were Kings: <HI>Nimrod</HI> rose up after the con∣fusion of Languages, and the People that understood the tongue he spoke, follow'd him; <HI>Saul</HI> was a young man unknown in <HI>Israel; Theseus</HI> and <HI>Ro∣mulus</HI> had nothing to recommend them before other <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> except the reputation of their Valor; and the Honors confer'd upon them for that reason, must proceed from expectation or hope, and not from gratitude or obligation. It must therefore proceed from the manner by which they came to be Kings. He that neither is nor has any title to be a King, can come to be so only by force or by consent. If by force, he dos not confer a Benefit upon the People, but injures them in the most out∣rageous manner. If it be possible therefore or reasonable to imagin that one man did ever subdue a multitude, he can no otherwise resemble a Father, than the worst of all Enemys who dos the greatest mischiefs, resembles the best of all Friends who confers the most inestimable bene∣fits; and consequently dos as justly deserve the utmost effects of hatred, as the other dos of love, respect, and service. If by consent, he who is rais'd from amongst the people, and plac'd above his Brethren, receives great honors and advantages, but confers none. The obligations of gra∣titude are on his side, and whatsoever he dos in acknowledgment to his Benefactors for their love to him, is no more than his duty; and he can demand no more from them than what they think fit to add to the favors already receiv'd. If more be pretended, it must be by virtue of that contract, and can no otherwise be prov'd than by producing it to be exa∣min'd, that the true sense, meaning, and intention of it may be known.</P>
<P>This Contract must be in form and substance according to a general Rule given to all mankind, or such as is left to the will of every Nation. If a general one be pretended, it ought to be shown, that by inquiring into the contents, we may understand the force and extent of it. If this cannot be done, it may justly pass for a fiction, no conclusion can be drawn from it; and we may be sure, that what Contracts soever have bin made between Nations and their Kings, have bin fram'd ac∣cording to the will of those Nations; and consequently how many soever they are, and whatsoever the sense of any or all of them may be, they can oblige no man, except those, or at the most the Descendents of those that made them. Whoever therefore would persuade us, that one or more Nations are, by virtue of those Contracts, bound to bear all the insolences of Tyrants, is oblig'd to show, that by those Contracts they did for ever indefinitely bind themselves so to do, how great soever they might be.</P>
<P>I may justly go a step farther, and affirm, That if any such should ap∣pear in the world, the folly and turpitude of the thing would be a suffi∣cient evidence of the madness of those that made it, and utterly destroy the contents of it: but no such having bin as yet produc'd, nor any reason given to persuade a wise man, that there has ever bin any such, at least among civiliz'd Nations, (for whom only we are concern'd) it may be concluded there never was any; or is there were, they do not at all relate to our subject; and consequently that Nations still continue in their na∣tive Liberty, and are no otherwise oblig'd to endure the insolence of Ty∣rants, than they, or each of them may esteem them tolerable.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="238"/>
 2. To the second: Tho the words of <HI>Samuel</HI> had imply'd a necessity incumbent upon the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to bear all the Injurys that their Kings should do to them, it could no way relate to us; for he dos not speak of all Kings, but of such as they had ask'd, even such as reign'd over the slavish <HI>Asia∣ticks</HI> their Neighbors, who are no less infamous in the world for their baseness and cowardice, than detestable for their idolatry and vices. It was not a plot or trick of <HI>Samuel</HI> to keep the Government in himself and Family; such scurrilous expressions or thoughts are fit only for <HI>Filmer, Heylin,</HI> and their Disciples: But the Prophet being troubled at the folly and wickedness of the people, who chose rather to subject themselves to the irregular Will of a Man, than to be govern'd by God and his Law, did, by the immediate command of God, declare to them what would be the event of their fury; that since they would be like to their Neigh∣bors in sin and folly, he told 'em they should be like to them in shame and misery; since they desir'd to cast off the thing that was good, they should suffer evil as the product of their own Counsels; and that when they should cry to the Lord from a sense of their miserys, he dos not tell them, as our Author falsly says, they should have no other remedy against Ty∣rants but crying and praying, but that their crys and prayers should not be heard. It was just that when they had rejected God, he should reject them, and leave them under the weight of the calamitys they had brought upon themselves. In all other cases God had ever said, that when his People return'd to him, he would hear and save them. When they cry'd by reason of the oppressions they suffer'd under the <HI>Egyptians, Cananites, Midianites, Philistins,</HI> and others, tho their crimes had deserv'd them all, yet God heard and reliev'd them. But when they meditated this final defection from his Law, and rejection of his Government, God seem'd to change his Nature, and forget to be gracious; <HI>When ye shall cry to me by reason of your King, I will not hear you.</HI> This was the strongest de∣hortation from their wicked Intention that can be imagin'd; but being not enough to reclaim them, they answer'd, <HI>Nay, but we will have a King.</HI> They were like to their Neighbors in folly and vice, and would be like to them in Government; which brought all the Calamitys upon them that the others suffer'd. But I know not what conclusion can be drawn from hence in favor of our Author's Doctrin, unless all Nations are oblig'd furiously to run into the same crimes with the <HI>Israelites,</HI> or to take upon themselves the same punishment, tho they do not commit the same crimes.</P>
<P>If this was not a Precept to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> instructing them what they should do, but a denunciation of what they should suffer for the evil which they had committed, the Old Testament will afford none; and I hope in due time to answer such as he alledges from the New. Nay, we may conclude there can be none there, because being dictated by the same Spirit, which is always uniform and constant to it self, it could not agree with the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deuteron.</HI> which so extremely restrains such a King as God allow'd, as not to suffer him in any manner to raise his heart above his Brethren; and was said in vain, if at the same time it gave him a Power which might not be resisted, or forbad others to resist him if he would not obey the Law.</P>
<P>3. To the third: Whatsoever was done by the Command of God a∣gainst <HI>Pharaoh</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and against the Kings of the <HI>Cananites, Midianites, Moabites, Edomites, Amorites</HI> or <HI>Philistins,</HI> by <HI>Moses, Joshua,</HI>
<PB N="235" REF="239"/>
<HI>Ehud, Barak, Gideon, Sampson, Jephtha, Samuel,</HI> and the rest of the Judges, comes expresly under the particular Precepts and Examples promis'd by me, to show, that God had occasionally commanded, and his Servants executed his Commands in resisting and destroying the Persons of Kings, who were their own Kings also, if Possession was only to be regarded. And tho this be sufficient to overthrow our Author's Doctrin; <HI>That we are not to examin the Titles of Kings, whether they be from usurpation, or any other means; but only to look upon the Power:</HI> Yet they who seek Truth, ought not to content themselves merely with Victory; or to esteem that a Victory, which is obtain'd by what the Schools call <HI>Argumentum ad hominem,</HI> grounded upon a false Proposition, and is of no force except against those who are so ill advis'd to advance it. Therefore laying aside the advantages that may be justly taken against <HI>Filmer,</HI> for the folly of asserting the same Right to be in a Usurper as in a lawful Prince; and confessing that tho such as have no Title, may and ought to be supprest as Enemys and Robbers, when respect and obedience is due to those who are rightly instituted; I say, that none can be claim'd by a Prince lawfully instituted, if he assumes to himself a Power which is not grant∣ed to him by the Law of his Institution, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quia eat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nus non hab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t imperium. <BIBL>De Jur. Bel.</BIBL></NOTE>because, as <HI>Grotius</HI> says, <HI>his legal Power does not extend so far;</HI> or turn the Power that is given him, to ends contrary to those for which it was given, because he thereby destroys it, and puts himself into the same condition as if it had never bin. This is prov'd by the Example of <HI>Saul;</HI> Tho the people sinn'd grievously in asking a King, yet God assenting to their demand, no Prince was ever more solemnly instituted than he. The People chose him by Lot from amongst all the Tribes, and he was plac'd in the Throne by the general consent of the whole Nation: But he turning his lawful Power into Ty∣ranny, disobeying the word of the Prophet, slaying the Priests, sparing the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> and oppressing the Innocent, overthrew his own Right; and God declar'd the Kingdom, which had bin given him under a con∣ditional promise of perpetuity, to be intirely abrogated. This did not only give a right to the whole People of opposing him, but to every par∣ticular man; and upon this account <HI>David</HI> did not only fly from his fury, but resisted it. He made himself head of all the discontented Persons that would follow him: he had at first four, and afterwards six hundred men; he kept these in Arms against <HI>Saul,</HI> liv'd upon the Country, and resolv'd to destroy <HI>Nabal</HI> with all his House, only for refusing to send Provisions for his men. Finding himself weak and unsafe, he went to <HI>Achish</HI> the <HI>Philistin,</HI> and offer'd his service even against <HI>Israel.</HI> This was never re∣puted a sin in <HI>David,</HI> or in those that follow'd him, by any except the wicked Court-flatterer <HI>Doeg</HI> the <HI>Edomite,</HI> and the drunken fool <HI>Nabal,</HI> who is said to have bin a man of <HI>Belial.</HI></P>
<P>If it be objected, That this was rather a Flight than a War, in as much as he neither kill'd <HI>Saul</HI> nor his men, or that he made war as a King anointed by <HI>Samuel;</HI> I answer, that he who had six hundred men, and entertain'd as many as came to him, sufficiently shew'd his intention rather to resist than to fly: And no other reason can be given why he did not farther pursue that intention, than that he had no greater power: and he who arms six hundred men against his Prince, when he can have no more, can no more be said to obey patiently, than if he had so many
<PB N="236" REF="240"/>
 hundreds of thousands. This holds, tho he kills no man, for that is not the War, but the manner of making it: and 'twere as absurd to say <HI>David</HI> made no War, because he kill'd no men, as that <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth made no War in <HI>Italy,</HI> because <HI>Guicciardin</HI> says, he conquer'd <HI>Naples</HI> without breaking a Lance. But as <HI>David</HI>'s strength increas'd, he grew to be less sparing of Blood. Those who say Kings never die, but that the right is immediately transfer'd to the next Heirs, cannot deny that <HI>Ishbosheth</HI> inherited the right of <HI>Saul,</HI> and that <HI>David</HI> had no other right of making war against him, than against <HI>Saul,</HI> unless it were confer'd upon him by the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> that made him King. If this be true, it must be confest that not only a whole People, but a part of them, may at their own pleasure abrogate a Kingdom, tho never so well establish'd by common consent; for none was ever more solemnly instituted than that of <HI>Saul;</HI> and few Subjects have more strongly oblig'd themselves to be obedient. If it be not true, the example of <HI>Nabal</HI> is to be follow'd; and <HI>David,</HI> tho guided by the Spirit of God, deserves to be condemn'd as a fellow that rose up against his Master.</P>
<P>If to elude this it be said, That God instituted and abrogated <HI>Saul</HI>'s Kingdom, and that <HI>David</HI> to whom the right was transmitted, might therefore proceed against him and his Heirs as privat men: I answer, that if the obedience due to <HI>Saul</HI> proceeded from God's Institution, it can ex∣tend to none but those who are so peculiarly instituted and anointed by his Command, and the hand of his Prophet, which will be of little advan∣tage to the Kings that can give no testimony of such an Institution or Unction; and an indisputable right will remain to every Nation of abro∣gating the Kingdoms which are instituted by and for themselves. But as <HI>David</HI> resisted the Authority of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Ishbosheth,</HI> without assuming the Power of a King, tho design'd by God, and anointed by the Prophet, till he was made King of <HI>Judah</HI> by that Tribe; or arrogating to himself a Power over the other Tribes till he was made King by them, and had enter'd into a Covenant with them; 'tis much more certain that the Per∣sons and Authority of ill Kings, who have no title to the Privileges due to <HI>Saul</HI> by virtue of his institution, may be justly resisted; which is as much as is necessary to my purpose.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 26.</NOTE>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But <HI>David</HI>'s Heart smote him when he had cut off the skirt of <HI>Saul</HI>'s Garment, and he would not suffer <HI>Abishai</HI> to kill him. This might be of some force, if it were pretended that every man was oblig'd to kill an ill King, whensoever he could do it, which I think no man ever did say; and no man having ever affirm'd it, no more can be concluded than is confest by all. But how is it possible that a man of a generous Spirit, like <HI>David,</HI> could see a great and valiant King, chosen from amongst all the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> anointed by the command of God and the hand of the Prophet, famous for victorys obtain'd against the enemys of <HI>Israel,</HI> and a wonderful deliverance thereby purchas'd to that People, cast at his feet to receive Life or Death from the hand of one whom he had so furi∣ously persecuted, and from whom he least deserv'd, and could least expect mercy, without extraordinary commotion of mind, most especially when <HI>Abishai,</HI> who saw all that he did, and thereby ought best to have known his thoughts, exprest so great a readiness to kill him? This could not but make him reflect upon the instability of all that seem'd to be most glorious in men, and shew him that if <HI>Saul,</HI> who had bin nam'd even among the Prophets, and assisted in an extraordinary manner to accomplish such great things, was so abandon'd and given over to fury, misery and shame;
<PB N="237" REF="241"/>
he that seem'd to be most firmly establish'd ought to take care lest he should fall.</P>
<P>Surely these things are neither to be thought strange in relation to <HI>Saul,</HI> who was God's Anointed, nor communicable to such as are not: Some may suppose he was King by virtue of God's unction (tho if that were true, he had never bin chosen and made King by the People) but it were madness to think he became God's Anointed by being King: for if that were so, the same Right and Title would belong to every King, even to those who by his command were accurs'd and destroy'd by his Servants <HI>Moses, Joshua</HI> and <HI>Samuel.</HI> The same men, at the same time, and in the same sense, would be both his anointed and accurs'd, lov'd and detested by him, and the most sacred Privileges made to extend to the worst of his enemys.</P>
<P>Again; the War made by <HI>David</HI> was not upon the account of being King, as anointed by <HI>Samuel,</HI> but upon the common natural right of de∣fending himself against the violence and fury of a wicked man; he trust∣ed to the promise, <HI>that he should be King,</HI> but knew that as yet he was not so: and when <HI>Saul</HI> found he had spar'd his Life, he said, <HI>I now know well that thou shalt surely be King, and that the Kingdom of</HI> Israel <HI>shall surely be establish'd in thy hand;</HI> not that it was already Nay <HI>David</HI> him∣self was so far from taking upon him to be King, till the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> had chosen him, that he often acknowledg'd <HI>Saul</HI> to be his Lord. When <HI>Baanah</HI> and <HI>Rechab</HI> brought the head of <HI>Ishbosheth</HI> to him, he commanded them to be slain; <HI>Because they had kill'd a righteous man upon his Bed, in</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 4.</NOTE><HI>his own House;</HI> which he could not have said, if <HI>Ishbosheth</HI> had unjustly detain'd from him the ten Tribes, and that he had a right to reign over them before they had chosen him. The Word of God did not make him King, but only foretold that he should be King; and by such ways as he pleas'd prepar'd the hearts of the People to set him up; and till the time design'd by God for that work was accomplish'd, he pretended to no other Authority, than what the six hundred men who first follow'd him, afterwards the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and at last all the rest of the Peo∣ple, confer'd upon him.</P>
<P>I no way defend <HI>Absalom</HI>'s revolt; he was wicked, and acted wicked∣ly: but after his death no man was ever blam'd or question'd for siding with him; and <HI>Amasa</HI> who commanded his Army, is represented in Scripture as a good man, even <HI>David</HI> saying, that <HI>Joab,</HI> by slaying <HI>Abner</HI> and <HI>Amasa,</HI> had kill'd <HI>two men who were better than himself:</HI> which could <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 20▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>not have bin, unless the People had a right of looking into matters of Go∣vernment, and of redressing abuses; tho being deceiv'd by <HI>Absalom,</HI> they so far err'd, as to prefer him, who was in all respects wicked, before the man, who, except in the matter of <HI>Ʋriah,</HI> is said to be after God's own heart. This right was acknowledg'd by <HI>David</HI> himself, when he com∣manded <HI>Hushai</HI> to say to <HI>Absalom, I will be thy Servant, O King;</HI> and by <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings.</NOTE><HI>Hushai</HI> in the following Chapter, <HI>Nay, but whom the Lord and his People, and all the men of</HI> Israel <HI>chuse, his will I be, and with him will I abide:</HI> which could have no sense in it, unless the People had a right of chusing, and that the choice in which they generally concur'd, was esteem'd to be from God.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Saul,</HI> who was made King by the whole People, and anointed by the command of God, might be lawfully resisted when he departed from the Law of his Institution; it cannot be doubted that any other for the like reason may be resisted. If <HI>David,</HI> tho design'd by God to be

 King, and anointed by the hand of the Prophet, was not King till the People had chosen him, and he had made a Covenant with them; it will, if I mistake not, be hard to find a man who can claim a right which is not originally from them. And if the People of <HI>Israel</HI> could erect and pull down, institute, abrogate, or transfer to other Persons or Familys, King∣doms more firmly establish'd than any we know, the same right cannot be deny'd to other Nations.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. The Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> were under a Law not safely to be transgrest.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author might be pardon'd if he only vented his own follys; but he aggravates his crime, by imputing them to men of more Credit; and tho I cannot look upon Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> as a very good In∣terpreter of Scripture, he had too much understanding to say, <HI>That if practice declare the greatness of Authority, even the best Kings of</HI> Israel <HI>and</HI> Judah <HI>were not ty'd to any Law, but they did whatsoever they pleas'd in the greatest matters;</HI> for there is no sense in those words. <HI>If Practice declares the greatness of Authority, even the best of Kings were ty'd to no Law,</HI> signi∣fies nothing, for Practice cannot declare the greatness of Authority. <HI>Peter</HI> the Cruel of <HI>Castille,</HI> and <HI>Christiern</HI> the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> kill'd whom they pleas'd; but no man ever thought they had therefore a right to do so: and if there was a Law, all were ty'd by it, and the best were less likely to break it than the worst. But if Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>'s opinion, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 L. Hist. c. 19.</NOTE>he calls a conjecture, be taken, there was so great a difference between the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> that as to their general proceedings in point of Power, hardly any thing can be said which may rightly be apply'd to both; and he there endeavours to show, that the reason why the ten Tribes did not return to the house of <HI>David,</HI> after the destruction of the houses of <HI>Jeroboam</HI> and <HI>Baasha,</HI> was, because they would not endure a Power so absolute as that which was exercis'd by the house of <HI>David.</HI> If he has therefore any where said that the Kings did what they pleas'd, it must be in the sense that <HI>Moses Maimonides</HI> says, The Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> committed many extravagances, because they were <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quia superbi erant corde, impii, &amp; spretores Legis. <BIBL>Mor. Nevoch.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>insolent, impious, and despisers of the Law.</HI> But whatsoever Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> may say (for I do not remember his words, and have not leisure to seek whether any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch are found in his Books) 'tis most evident they did not what they pleas'd. The Tribes that did not submit to <HI>David,</HI> nor crown him till they thought fit, and then made a Covenant with him, took care it might be observ'd whether he would or not. <HI>Absalom</HI>'s Rebellion follow'd by almost all <HI>Israel,</HI> was a terrible check to his Will. That of <HI>Sheba,</HI> the Son of <HI>Bichri,</HI> was like to have bin worse, if it had not bin supprest by <HI>Joab</HI>'s diligence; and <HI>David</HI> often confest the Sons of <HI>Zerviah</HI> were too hard for him. <HI>Solomon</HI> indeed, overthrowing the Law given by <HI>Moses,</HI> multiplying Gold and Silver, Wives and Horses, introducing Idolatry,
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
and lifting up his heart above his Brethren, did what he pleas'd; but <HI>Re∣hoboam</HI> paid for all: the ten Tribes revolted from him, by reason of the heavy burdens laid upon them; ston'd <HI>Adoram</HI> who was sent to levy the Tributes, and set up <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> who, as Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> says in the place before cited, had no other Title than the courtesy of the People, and utterly rejected the house of <HI>David.</HI> If practice therefore declares a right, the practice of the People to avenge the injurys they suffer'd from their Kings, as soon as they found a man fit to be their Leader, shews they had a right of doing it.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the best of the Kings, with <HI>Moses, Joshua,</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> may in one sense be said to have done what they pleas'd, because they desir'd to do that only which was good. But this will hardly be brought to con∣fer a right upon all Kings: And I deny that even the Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> did what they pleas'd, or that it were any thing to our question if they did. <HI>Zedekiah</HI> profest to the great men (that is, to the <HI>Sanhedrin) that without</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jerem. 38.</NOTE><HI>them he could do nothing.</HI> When <HI>Amaziah,</HI> by his folly, had brought a great slaughter upon the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> they conspir'd against him in Publick Council; whereupon he fled to <HI>Lachish,</HI> and they pursuing him <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings 14.</NOTE>thither, kill'd him, avow'd the Fact, and it was neither question'd, nor blam'd: which examples agree with the paraphrase of <HI>Josephus</HI> on <HI>Deut.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiq. Jud</NOTE>17. <HI>He shall do nothing without the consent of the</HI> Sanhedrin; <HI>and if he at∣tempt it, they shall hinder him.</HI> This was the Law of God, not to be ab∣rogated by Man; a Law of Liberty directly opposite to the necessity of submitting to the will of a man. This was a Gift bestow'd by God upon his Children and People; whereas slavery was a great part of the Curse denounc'd against <HI>Cham</HI> for his wickedness, and perpetually incumbent upon his Posterity. The great <HI>Sanhedrin</HI> were constituted Judges, as <HI>Grotius</HI> says, most particularly of such matters as concern'd their Kings; and <HI>Maimonides</HI> affirms, that the Kings were judg'd by them: The distri∣bution of the power to the inferior <HI>Sanhedrins,</HI> in every Tribe and City, with the right of calling the People together in general Assemblys as often as occasion requir'd, were the foundations of their Liberty; and being added to the Law of the Kingdom prescrib'd in the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> if they should think fit to have a King, establish'd the Freedom of that People upon a solid foundation. And tho in their fury they did in a great measure wave the benefits God had bestow'd upon 'em; yet there was enough left to restrain the Lusts of their Kings. <HI>Ahab</HI> did not treat with <HI>Naboth</HI> as with a Servant, whose Person and Estate depended upon his Will; and dos not seem to have bin so tender-hearted to grieve much for his refusal, if by virtue of his Royal Authority he could have taken away his Vineyard and his Life: But that failing, he had no other way of ac∣complishing his design, than by the fraud of his accursed Wife, and the perfidious Wretches she imploy'd. And no better proof that it did fail, can reasonably be requir'd, than that he was oblig'd to have recourse to such sordid, odious, and dangerous Remedys: But we are furnish'd with one that is more unquestionable; <HI>Hast thou kill'd, and also taken possession?</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings 21.</NOTE><HI>In the place where Dogs lick'd the blood of</HI> Naboth, <HI>shall they lick thy Blood, even thine.</HI> This shews that the Kings were not only under a Law, but under a Law of equality with the rest of the People, even that of Reta∣liation. He had rais'd his heart above his Brethren; but God brought him down, and made him to suffer what he had done; he was in all respects wicked, but the justice of this sentence consisted in the Law he had broken, which could not have bin, if he had bin subject to none. But
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
 as this Retaliation was the sum of all the Judicial Law given by God to his People, the Sentence pronounc'd against <HI>Ahab</HI> in conformity to it, and the execution committed to <HI>Jehu,</HI> shews, that the Kings were no less oblig'd to perform the Law than other men, tho they were not so easily punish'd for transgressing it as others were; and if many of them did escape, it perfectly agrees with what had bin foretold by <HI>Samuel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Samuel</HI> did not describe to the <HI>Israelites</HI> the glory of a free Monarchy; but the Evils the People should suffer, that he might divert them from desiring a King.</HEAD>
<P>THO no restraint had bin put upon the Hebrew Kings, it could be no prejudice to any other Nation. They deflected from the Law of God; and rejecting him that he should reign over them no longer, they fell into that misery which could affect none but those who enjoy the same Blessings, and with the same fury despise them. If their Kings had more Power than consisted with their welfare, they gave it, and God renounces the institution of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ye have chosen Kings, but not by me; and Princes, but I know them not. <BIBL>Hos.</BIBL></NOTE>such. He gave them a Law of Liberty; and if they fell into the shame and misery that accompanys slavery, it was their own work. They were not oblig'd to have any King; and could not without a crime have any but one, who must not raise his heart above the rest of them. This was taught by <HI>Moses:</HI> And <HI>Samuel,</HI> who spoke by the same Spirit, could not contradict him; and in telling the People what such a King as they desir'd would do when he should be establish'd, he did announce to them the misery they would bring upon themselves, by chusing such a one as he had forbidden. This free Mo∣narchy, which our Author thinks to be so majestically describ'd, was not only displeasing to the Prophet, but declar'd by God to be a rejection of him, and inconsistent with his reign over them. This might have bin sufficient to divert any other people from their furious resolution; but the Prophet farther enforcing his dissuasion, told them, that God (who had in all other cases bin their helper) would not hear them when they should cry to him by reason of their King. This is the majestick descrip∣tion of that free Monarchy with which our Author is so much pleas'd: It was displeasing to the Prophet, hateful to God, an aggravation of all the crimes they had committed since they came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that which would bring (as it did) most certain and irreparable destruction upon them.</P>
<P>But it seems the Regal Majesty in that Age was in its infancy, and little in comparison of that which we find describ'd by <HI>Tacitus, Suetonius,</HI> and others in later times. He shall take your Sons, says <HI>Samuel,</HI> and set them over his Chariots, and your Daughters to make them Confectioners and Cooks; but the Majesty of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors was carry'd to a higher pitch of Glory. <HI>Ahab</HI> could not, without employing treachery and fraud, get a small spot of ground for his mony to make a Garden of Herbs: But
<PB N="241" REF="247"/>
<HI>Tiberius, Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero</HI> kill'd whom they pleas'd, and took what they pleas'd of their Estates. When they had satiated their cruelty and ava∣rice by the murders and confiscations of the most eminent and best men, they commonly expos'd their Children to the Lust of their Slaves. If the power of doing evil be glorious, the utmost excess is its perfection; and 'tis pity that <HI>Samuel</HI> knew no more of the effects produc'd by unrestrain'd Lust, that he might have made the description yet more majestick: and as nothing can be suffer'd by man beyond constupration, torments and death, instead of such trifles as he mention'd, he might have shew'd them the effects of Fury in its greatest exaltation.</P>
<P>If it be good for a Nation to live under such a Power, why did not God of his own goodness institute it? Did his Wisdom and Love to his People fail? or if he himself had not set up the best Government over them, could he be displeas'd with them for asking it? Did he separate that Nation from the rest of Mankind, to make their condition worse than that of others? Or can they be said to have sin'd and rejected God, when they desir'd nothing but the Government, which by a perpetual Ordinance he had establish'd over all the Nations of the World? Is not the Law of Nature a Rule which he has given to things? and the Law of man's Na∣ture, which is Reason, an emanation of the divine Wisdom, or some footsteps of divine Light remaining in us? Is it possible that this which is from God, can be contrary to his Will; and can he be offended with those who desire to live in a conformity to that Law? Or could it justly be said, The People had chosen that which is not good, if nothing in Go∣vernment be good but what they chose?</P>
<P>But as the worst men delight in the worst things, and Fools are pleas'd with the most extreme absurditys, our Author not only gives the highest praises to that which bears so many marks of God's hatred; but after hav∣ing said that <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</HI> and <HI>Moses</HI> were Kings, he tells us, <HI>The</HI> Israelites <HI>beg'd a King of</HI> Samuel; which had bin impertinent, if the Magistrats instituted by the Law were Kings: and tho it might be a folly in them to ask what they had already, it could be no sin to desire that which they enjoy'd by the Ordinance of God. If they were not Kings, it follows that the only Government set up by God amongst men wanted the principal part, even the Head and Foundation, from whence all the other parts have their action and being; that is, God's Law is against God's Law, and destroys it self.</P>
<P>But if God did neither by a general and perpetual Ordinance establish over all Nations the Monarchy which <HI>Samuel</HI> describes, nor prescribe it to his own People by a particular Command, it was purely the Peoples Crea∣ture, the production of their own fancy, conceiv'd in wickedness, and brought forth in iniquity, an Idol set up by themselves to their own de∣struction, in imitation of their accursed Neighbours; and their Reward was no better than the concession of an impious Petition, which is one of God's heaviest Judgments. <HI>Samuel</HI>'s words are acknowledg'd by all Interpreters, who were not malicious or mad, to be a dissuasion from their wicked purpose; not a description of what a King might justly do by virtue of his Office, but what those who should be set up against God and his Law would do when they came to have the power in their hands: And I leave such as have the understandings of men, and are not aban∣don'd by God, to judg what influence this ought to have upon other Na∣tions, either as to obligation or imitation.</P>

<HEAD> SECT. IV. No People can be oblig'd to suffer from their Kings what they have not a right to do.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's next work is to tell us, That <HI>the scope of</HI> Samuel <HI>was to teach the People a dutiful obedience to their King, even in the things that they think mischievous or inconvenient: For by telling them what the King would do, he indeed instructs them what a Subject must suffer: Yet not so that it is right for Kings to do injury, but it is right for them to go unpunish'd by the People if they do it; so that in this point it is all one whether</HI> Samuel <HI>describe a King or a Tyrant.</HI> This is hard, but the Conclusion is grounded upon nothing. There is no relation between a Prediction that a thing shall be attempted or done to me, and a Precept that I shall not defend my self, or punish the person that attempts or dos it. If a Prophet should say that a Thief lay in the way to kill me, it might reasonably persuade me not to go, or to go in such a manner as to be able to defend my self; but can no way oblige me to submit to the violence that shall be offer'd, or my Friends and Children not to avenge my death if I fall: much less can other men be depriv'd of the natural right of defending themselves, by my imprudence or obstinacy in not taking the warning given, whereby I might have preserv'd my life. For every man has a right of resisting some way or other that which ought not to be done to him; and tho human Laws do not in all cases make men Judges and A∣vengers of the Injurys offer'd to them, I think there is none that dos not justify the man who kills another that offers violence to him, if it appears that the way prescrib'd by the Law for the preservation of the Innocent cannot be taken. This is not only true in the case of outrageous attempts to assassi∣nate or rob on the high way, but in divers others of less moment. I knew a man who being appointed to keep his Master's Park, kill'd three men in one night that came to destroy his Deer; and putting himself into the hands of the Magistrate, and confessing the Fact both in matter and manner, he was at the publick Assizes not only acquitted, but commended for having done his duty; and this in a time when 'tis well known Justice was severely administer'd, and little favor expected by him or his Ma∣ster. Nay, all Laws must fall, human Societys that subsist by them be dissolv'd, and all innocent persons be expos'd to the violence of the most wicked, if men might not justly defend themselves against injustice by their own natural right, when the ways prescrib'd by publick Autho∣rity cannot be taken.</P>
<P>Our Author may perhaps say, this is true in all except the King: And I desire to know why, if it be true in all except the King, it should not be true in relation to him? Is it possible that he who is instituted for the obtaining of Justice, should claim the liberty of doing Injustice as a Privi∣lege? Were it not better for a people to be without Law, than that a Power should be establish'd by Law to commit all manner of violen∣ces with impunity? Did not <HI>David</HI> resist those of <HI>Saul?</HI> Did he not make himself head of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> when they revolted against his Son, and afterwards of the ten Tribes that rejected his Poste∣rity?
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>
Did not the <HI>Israelites</HI> stone <HI>Adoram</HI> who collected the Taxes, revolt from the House of <HI>David,</HI> set up <HI>Jeroboam;</HI> and did not the Prophet say it was from the Lord? If it was from the Lord, was it not good? If it was good then, is it not so for ever? Did good proceed from one root then, and from another now? If God had aveng'd the Blood of <HI>Naboth</HI> by fire from Heaven, and destroy'd the House of <HI>Ahab,</HI> as he did the two Cap∣tains and their men who were sent to apprehend <HI>Elijah,</HI> it might be said, he reserv'd that vengeance to himself; but he did it by the Sword of <HI>Jehu</HI> and the Army (which was the People who had set him up) for an Ex∣ample to others.</P>
<P>But 'tis good to examin what this <HI>dutiful Obedience</HI> is that our Author mentions. Men usually owe no more than they receive. 'Tis hard to know what the <HI>Israelites</HI> ow'd to <HI>Saul, David, Jeroboam, Ahab,</HI> or any other King, whether good or bad, till they were made Kings: And the Actof the People by which so great a dignity was confer'd, seems to have laid a duty upon them, who did receive more than they had to give: so that something must be due from them, unless it were releas'd by vir∣tue of a Covenant or Promise made; and none could accrue to them from the people afterwards, unless from the merit of the person in rightly exe∣cuting his Office. If a Covenant or Promise be pretended, the nature and extent of the Obligation can only be known by the contents exprest, or the true intention of it. If there be a general form of Covenant set and agreed upon, to which all Nations must submit, it were good to know where it may be found, and by whose Authority it is establish'd, and then we may examin the sense of it. If no such do appear, we may ra∣tionally look upon those to be Impostors, who should go about from thence to derive a right: And as that which dos not appear, is as if it were not, we may justly conclude there is no other, or none that can have any effect, but such as have bin made by particular Nations with their Princes; which can be of no force or obligation to others, nor to themselves, any farther than according to the true intention of those that made them. There is no such thing therefore as a dutiful obedience, or duty of being obedient, incumbent upon all Nations by virtue of any Co∣venant; nor upon any particular Nation, unless it be exprest by a Cove∣nant: and whoever pretends to a right of taking our Sons and Daugh∣ters, Lands or Goods, or to go unpunish'd if he do, must show that these things are exprest or intended by the Covenant.</P>
<P>But tho Nations for the most part owe nothing to Kings till they are Kings, and that it can hardly be conceiv'd, that any people did ever owe so much to a man, as might not be fully repaid by the honor and advan∣tages of such an advancement; yet 'tis possible that when they are made Kings, they may by their good Government lay such Obligations upon their Subjects, as ought to be recompens'd by obedience and service. There is no mortal Creature that deserves so well from mankind, as a wise, valiant, diligent and just King, who as a Father cherishes his People; as a Shepherd feeds, defends, and is ready to lay down his life for his flock; who is a terror to evil doers, and a praise to those that do well. This is a glorious Prerogative, and he who has it is happy. But before this can be adjudg'd to belong to all, it must be prov'd that all have the Vertues that deserve it; and he that exacts the dutiful Obedi∣ence that arises from them, must prove that they are in him. He that dos this, need not plead for impunity when he dos injurys; for if he do them, he is not the man we speak of: Not being so, he can have no title
<PB N="244" REF="250"/>
 to the duty by human Institution or Covenant; nor by divine Law, since, as is already prov'd, God has neither establish'd Kings over all Nations by Precept, nor recommended them by Example, in setting them over his own People. He has not therefore done it at all; there is no such thing in nature; and Nations can owe nothing to Kings merely as Kings, but what they owe by the Contract made with them.</P>
<P>As these Contracts are made voluntarily, without any previous obli∣gation, 'tis evident that men make them in consideration of their own good, and they can be of force no longer, than he with whom they are made perform his part in procuring it; and that if he turn the power which was given to him for the publick good, to the publick inconveni∣ence and damage, he must necessarily lose the benefit he was to receive by it. The word <HI>think</HI> is foolishly and affectedly put in by our Author; for those matters are very often so evident, that even the weakest know them. No great sagacity is requir'd to understand that leud, slothful, ignorant, false, unjust, covetous and cruel Princes bring inconveniences and mischiefs upon Nations; and many of them are so evidently guilty of some or all these Vices, that no man can be mistaken in imputing them; and the utmost Calamitys may rationally be expected from them, unless a Remedy be apply'd.</P>
<P>But, says he, <HI>Samuel</HI> by telling them <HI>what the King would do, instructs them what the Subjects must suffer, and that 'tis right he should go unpunish'd.</HI> But, by his favor, <HI>Samuel</HI> says no such thing; neither is it to be conclud∣ed, that because a King will do wickedly, he must be suffer'd, any more than a private man, who should take the same Resolution. But he told them, that <HI>when they should cry to the Lord by reason of their King, he would not hear them.</HI> This was as much as to say, their ruin was una∣voidable; and that, having put the power into the hands of those, who instead of protecting would oppress them; and thereby having provok'd God against them, so as he would not hearken to their cries, they could have no relief. But this was no security to the Authors of their Calamity. The Houses of <HI>Jeroboam, Baasha</HI> and <HI>Omri,</HI> escap'd not unpunish'd, tho the People did not thereby recover their Liberty. The Kings had intro∣duc'd a Corruption that was inconsistent with it. But they who could not settle upon a right Foundation to prevent future mischiefs, could a∣venge such as they had suffer'd, upon the heads of those who had caus'd 'em, and frequently did it most severely. The like besel the <HI>Romans,</HI> when by the violence of Tyranny all good Order was overthrown, good Disci∣plin extinguish'd, and the People corrupted. Ill Princes could be cut in pieces, and mischiefs might be reveng'd, tho not prevented. But 'tis not so every where, nor at all times; and nothing is more irrational, than from one or a few Examples to conclude a general necessity of future E∣vents. They alter according to Circumstances: and as some Nations by destroying Tyrants could not destroy Tyranny; others in removing the Tyrant, have cut up Tyranny by the roots. This variety has bin seen in the same Nation at different times: The <HI>Romans</HI> recover'd their Liber∣ty by expelling <HI>Tarquin;</HI> but remain'd Slaves notwithstanding the slaugh∣ter of <HI>Cesar.</HI> Whilst the Body of the People was uncorrupted, they cur'd the Evil wrought by the Person, in taking him away. It was no hard matter to take the Regal Power that by one man had bin enjoy'd for life, and to place it in the hands of two annual Magistrats, whilst the Nobility and People were, according to the condition of that Age, strong and ready to maintain it. But when the mischief had taken deeper root;
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>
when the best part of the people had perish'd in the Civil Wars; when all their eminent men had fallen in battel, or by the Proscriptions; when their Disciplin was lost, and Vertue abolish'd, the poor remains of the distrest people were brought under the power of a mercenary Soldie∣ry, and found no relief. When they kill'd one Tyrant, they often made room for a worse: It avail'd them nothing to cut off a rotten Branch, whilst the accursed Root remain'd, and sent forth new Sprouts of the same nature to their destruction, Other generous Nations have bin sub∣du'd beyond a possibility of recovery; and those that are naturally base, slide into the like misery without the impulse of an exterior Power. They are Slaves by nature, and have neither the understanding nor courage that is requir'd for the constitution and management of a Government within themselves. They can no more subsist without a Master, than a flock without a Shepherd. They have no comprehension of Liberty, and can neither desire the good they do not know, nor enjoy it if it were bestow'd upon them. They bear all burdens; and whatever they suffer, they have no other remedy or refuge, than in the mercy of their Lord. But such Nations as are naturally strong, stout, and of good understanding, whose vigor remains unbroken, manners uncorrupted, reputation unble∣mish'd, and increasing in numbers; who neither want men to make up such Armys as may defend 'em against foreign or domestick Enemys, nor Leaders to head them, do ordinarily set limits to their patience. They know how to preserve their Liberty, or to vindicate the violation of it; and the more patient they have bin, the more inflexible they are when they resolve to be so no longer. Those who are so foolish to put them upon such courses, do to their cost find there is a difference between Lions and Asses; and he is a fool who knows not that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ignorat{que} datos ne quisquam serviat enses. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></NOTE>Swords were given to men, that none might be Slaves, but such as know not how to use them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. The Mischiefs suffer'd from wicked Kings are such as render it both reasonable and just for all Nations that have Vertue and Power, to exert both in repelling them.</HEAD>
<P>IF our Author deserve credit, we need not examin whether Nations have a right of resisting, or a reasonable hope of succeeding in their endeavours to prevent or avenge the Mischiefs that are fear'd or suffer'd, for 'tis not worth their pains. <HI>The Inconveniences,</HI> says he, <HI>and Miserys which are reckon'd up by</HI> Samuel, <HI>as belonging to Kingly Government, were not intolerable, but such as have bin and still are born by the Subjects free consent from their Princes. Nay at this day, and in this Land, many Tenants by their Tenures are ty'd unto the same subjection, even unto subordinate and inferior Lords.</HI> He is an excellent Advocate for Kingly Government, that accounts Inconveniences and Miserys to be some of the essentials of it; which others esteem to be only incidents. Tho many Princes are violent and wicked, yet some have bin gentle and just: tho many have brought misery upon Nations, some have bin beneficial to them: and they who are esteem'd most severe against Monarchy, think the evils often
<PB N="246" REF="252"/>
 suffer'd under that form of Government proceed from the Corruption of it, or deviation from the principle of its institution; and that they are rather to be imputed to the vices of the Person, than to the thing it self: but if our Author speak truth, it is universally and eternally naught, inconve∣nience and misery belong to it.</P>
<P>He thinks to mend this by saying, they are not intolerable: but what is intolerable, if Inconveniences and Miserys be not? For what end can he think Governments to have bin establish'd, unless to prevent or re∣move Inconveniences and Miserys? or how can that be call'd a Govern∣ment which dos not only permit, but cause them? What can incline Nations to set up Governments? Is it that they may suffer Inconveniences, and be brought to misery? or if it be to enjoy happiness, how can that subsist under a Government, which not by accident, deflection or cor∣ruption, but by a necessity inherent in it self, causes Inconveniences and Miserys? If it be pretended that no human Constitution can be altoge∣ther free from Inconveniences; I answer, that the best may to some degree fall into them, because they may be corrupted: but evil and misery can properly belong to none that is not evil in its own nature. If <HI>Samuel</HI> de∣serve credit, or may be thought to have spoken sense, he could not have enumerated the evils which he foresaw the People should suffer from their Kings, nor say that they should cry to the Lord by reason of them, unless they were in themselves grievous, and in comparison greater than what they had suffer'd or known; since that would not have diverted them from their intention, but rather have confirm'd 'em in it. And I leave it to our Author to show, why any People should for the pleasure of one or a few men, erect or suffer that Government which brings more of evil with it than any other.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is a great difference between that which Nations sometimes suffer under Kings, and that which they willingly suffer; most especially if our Author's Maxim be receiv'd, That all Laws are the Mandates of Kings, and the Subjects Libertys and Privileges no more than their gracious Concessions; for how patient soever they are under the Evils they suffer, it might reasonably be believ'd they are so because they know not how to help it: And this is certainly the case of too many places that are known to us. Whoever doubts of this, if he will not put himself to the trouble of going to <HI>Turky</HI> or <HI>Morocco,</HI> let him pass only into <HI>Normandy,</HI> and ask the naked, bare-footed and half-starv'd people whether they are willing to suffer the Miserys under which they groan; and whether the magnificence of <HI>Versailles,</HI> and the pomp of their haugh∣ty Master, do any way alleviate their Calamitys. If this also be a mat∣ter of too much pains, the Wretches that come hither every day will in∣form him, that it is not by their own consent they are depriv'd of all Honors and Offices in the Commonwealth, even of those, which by a corrupt Custom that had gain'd the force of a Law, they had dearly bought; prohibited to exercise any trade; expos'd to the utmost effects of fraud and violence, if they refuse to adore their Master's Idols. They will tell him, that 'tis not willingly they leave their Lands and Estates to seek a shelter in the most remote parts of the World; but because they are under a force which they are notable to resist; and because one part of the Nation, which is enrich'd with the Spoils of the other, have foolishly contributed to lay a Yoke upon them which they cannot break.</P>
<P>To what he says concerning Tenures, I answer; No man in <HI>England</HI> ows any service to his Lord, unless by virtue of a Contract made by him∣self

or his Predecessors, under which he holds the Land granted to him on that condition by the Proprietor. There may be something of hardship, but nothing of injustice. 'Tis a voluntary act in the beginning and con∣tinuance; and all men know that what is done to one who is willing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Volenti non fit injuria.</NOTE>is no injury. He who did not like the Conditions, was not oblig'd to take the Land; and he might leave it, if afterwards he came to dislike them. If any man say, the like may be done by any one in the King∣dom, I answer, That it is not always true; the Protestants now in <HI>France</HI> cannot without extreme hazard go out of that Country, tho they are contented to lose their Estates. 'Tis accounted a Crime, for which they are condemn'd perpetually to the Gallys, and such as are aiding to them to grievous Fines. But before this be acknowledg'd to have any similitude or relation to our discourse concerning Kings, it must be prov'd, that the present King, or those under whom he claims, is or were Pro∣prietors of all the Lands in <HI>England,</HI> and granted the several parcels under the condition of suffering patiently such Inconveniences and Miserys as are above-mention'd: or that they who did confer the Crown upon any of them, did also give a Propriety in the Land; which I do not find in any of the fifteen or sixteen Titles that have bin since the coming in of the <HI>Normans:</HI> and if it was not done to the first of every one, it cannot ac∣crue to the others, unless by some new act to the same purpose, which will not easily be produc'd.</P>
<P>It will be no less difficult to prove that any thing unworthy of Freemen is by any Tenures impos'd in <HI>England,</HI> unless it be the offering up of the Wives and Daughters of Tenants to the Lust of Abbots and Monks; and they are so far from being willingly suffer'd, that since the Dens and Nur∣serys of those Beasts were abolish'd, no man that succeeds them has had impudence sufficient to exact the performance: and tho the letter of the Law may favor them, the turpitude of the thing has extinguish'd the usage.</P>
<P>But even the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> who brought upon the Peo∣ple those evils that had bin foretold by <HI>Samuel,</HI> did not think they had a right to the Powers they exercis'd. If the Law had given a right to <HI>Ahab</HI> to take the best of their Vineyards, he might without ceremony have taken that of <HI>Naboth,</HI> and by the majestick power of an absolute Monarch, have chastis'd the churlish Clown, who refus'd to sell or change it for another: but for want of it, he was oblig'd to take a very different course. If the lives of Subjects had in the like manner depended on the will of Kings, <HI>David</HI> might without scruple have kill'd <HI>Ʋriah,</HI> rather than to place him in the front of the Army that he might fall by his own courage. The malice and treachery of such Proceedings argues a defect of power; and he that acts in such an oblique manner, shews that his actions are not warranted by the Law which is boldly executed in the face of the Sun. This shews the interpretation put upon the words, <HI>Against thee only have I sinn'd,</HI> by Court-flatterers, to be false. For if he had not sinn'd against <HI>Bathsheba</HI> whom he corrupted, <HI>Ʋriah</HI> whom he caus'd to be kill'd, the People that he scandaliz'd, and the Law which he vio∣lated, he had never endeavour'd to cover his guilt by so vile a fraud. And as he did not thereby fly the sight of God, but of men, 'tis evident that in that action he fear'd men more than God.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="254"/>
 If by the Examples of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> we may judg whether the Inconveniences and Miserys brought upon Nations by their Kings be to∣lerable or intolerable, it will be enough to consider the madness of <HI>Saul</HI>'s cruelty towards his Subjects, and the slaughter brought upon them by the hand of the <HI>Philistins</HI> on Mount <HI>Gilboa,</HI> where he fell with the flower of all <HI>Israel;</HI> the Civil Wars that happen'd in the time of <HI>David,</HI> and the Plague brought upon the People by his wickedness; the heavy burdens laid upon them by <HI>Solomon,</HI> and the Idolatry favor'd by him; the wret∣ched folly of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> and the defection of the ten Tribes caus'd by it; the Idolatry establish'd by <HI>Jeroboam</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> with that of many of those of <HI>Judah</HI> also; the frequent Wars and unheard of Slaughters ensuing thereupon between the Tribes; the daily devastations of the Country by all sorts of Strangers; the murders of the Prophets; the abolition of God's Worship; the desolation of Towns and Provinces; the dispersion of the ten Tribes carry'd away into unknown Countrys; and in the end the abolition of both Kingdoms, with the captivity of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and the utter destruction of the City. It cannot be said that these things were suffer'd under Kings, and not from or by them; for the desolation of the Citys, People and Country, is in many places of Scripture imputed to the Kings that taught <HI>Israel</HI> to sin, as appears by <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 14. 2 King. 21. 2 King. 20.</NOTE>what was denounc'd against <HI>Jeroboam, Jehu, Ahaz, Manasseh, Zedekiah,</HI> and others. Nay, the Captivity of <HI>Babylon</HI> with the evils ensuing, were first announc'd to <HI>Hezekiah</HI> for his vanity; and <HI>Josiah</HI> by the like, brought a great slaughter upon himself and people. But if mischiefs fell upon the People by the frailty of these, who after <HI>David</HI> were the best, nothing surely less than the utmost of all Miserys could be expected from such as were set to do evil, and to make the Nation like to themselves, in which they met with too great success.</P>
<P>If it be pretended that God's People living under an extraordinary Dis∣pensation can be no example to us, I desire other Historys may be examin'd; for I confess I know no Nation so great, happy and prospe∣rous, nor any Power so well establish'd, that two or three ill Kings im∣mediatly succeeding each other, have not bin able to destroy and bring to such a condition, that it appear'd the Nations must perish, unless the Senats, Diets, and other Assemblys of State had put a stop to the mischief, by restraining or deposing them. And tho this might be prov'd by innu∣merable Testimonys, I shall only say, that the Roman Empire perish'd by the vices, corruption, and baseness of their Princes: the noble King∣dom of the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> was overthrown by the Tyranny of <HI>Witza</HI> and <HI>Rodrigo:</HI> the present state of <HI>Spain</HI> now languishes and threatens ruin from the same causes: <HI>France</HI> was brought to the last degree of misery and weakness by the degenerate races of <HI>Pharamond</HI> and <HI>Charles;</HI> to which may be added those of our own Country, which are so well known that I need not mention them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. 'Tis not good for such Nations as will have Kings, to suffer them to be glorious, powerful, or abounding in Riches.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author having hitherto spoken of all Nations, as born under a necessity of being subject to Absolute Monarchy, which he pretends to have bin set up by the universal and indispensible Law of God and Nature, now seems to leave to their discretion, whether they will have a King or not; but says, that those <HI>who will have a King, are bound to allow him Royal Maintenance, by providing Revenues for the Crown; since it is for the Honor, Profit and Safety of the People, to have their King glorious, powerful, and abounding in Riches.</HI> If there be any thing of sense in this Clause, there is nothing of truth in the foundation or principle of his whole Book. For as the right and being of a Father is natural or inherent, and no ways depending upon the will of the Child; that of a King is so also, if he be, and ought to enjoy the Rights belonging to the Father of the People: And 'tis not less ridiculous to say, <HI>those who will have a King,</HI> than it would be to say, <HI>he that will have a Father;</HI> for every one must have one whether he will or not. But if the King be a Father, as our Author from thence infers, that all Laws are from him, none can be impos'd upon him; and whatsoever the Subject enjoys is by his con∣cessions; 'tis absurd to speak of an Obligation lying upon the people to allow him Royal maintenance, by providing Revenues, since he has all in himself, and they have nothing that is not from him, and depending upon his Will. For this reason a worthy Gentleman of the House of Commons in the year 1640. desir'd that the business of the Judges, who in the Star-Chamber had given for their Opinion concerning Shipmony, <HI>That in cases of Necessity the King might provide it by his own Authority, and that he was Judg of that Necessity,</HI> might be first examin'd, that they might know whether they had any thing to give, before they should speak of giving. And as 'tis certain, that if the Sentence of those perjur'd Wret∣ches had stood, the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> by consequence would have bin sound to have nothing to give; 'tis no less sure, that if our Author's prin∣ciple concerning the Paternal and Absolute Power of Kings be true, it will by a more compendious way appear, that it is not left to the choice of any Nation, whether they will have a King or not; for they must have him, and can have nothing to allow him, but must receive all from him.</P>
<P>But if those only who <HI>will have a King,</HI> are bound to have one, and to allow this <HI>Royal maintenance,</HI> such as will not have a King, are by one and the same act deliver'd from the necessity of having one, and from provid∣ing Maintenance for him: which utterly overthrows the magnificent Fa∣brick of Paternal Monarchy; and the Kings who were lately represented by our Author, plac'd on the Throne by God and Nature, and endow'd with an absolute Power over all, appear to be purely the Creatures of the People, and to have nothing but what is receiv'd from them.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="256"/>
 From hence it may be rationally infer'd, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qui dat esse, dat modum esse.</NOTE>he who makes a thing to be, makes it to be only what he pleases. This must hold in relation to Kings as well as other Magistrats; and as they who made Consuls, Dictators, and Military Tribuns, gave them only such Power, and for such a time as best pleas'd themselves, 'tis impossible they should not have the same right in relation to Kings, in making them what they please, as well as not to make them unless they please; except there be a Charm belonging to the Name, or the Letters that compose it; which cannot be∣long to all Nations, for they are different in every one according to the several Languages.</P>
<P>But, says our Author, 'tis <HI>for the Honor, Profit, and Safety of the Peo∣ple that the King should be glorious, powerful, and abounding in Riches.</HI> There is therefore no obligation upon them, and they are to judg whether it be so or not. The Scripture says plainly the contrary: <HI>He shall not mul∣tiply Silver and Gold, Wives and Horses; he shall not lift up his Heart above his Brethren.</HI> He shall not therefore be glorious, powerful, or abounding in Riches. Reason and Experience teach us the same thing: If those Nations that have bin proud, luxurious and vicious, have desir'd by Pomp and Riches to foment the Vices of their Princes, thereby to cherish their own; such as have excel'd in Vertue and good Disciplin have abhor'd it, and except the immediate exercise of their Office, have kept their supreme Magistrats to a manner of living little different from that of private men: and it had bin impossible to maintain that frugality, in which the integri∣ty of their manners did chiefly consist, if they had set up an Example directly contrary to it, in him who was to be an Example to others; or to provide for their own safety, if they had overthrown that integrity of manners by which it could only be obtain'd and preserv'd. There is a necessity incumbent upon every Nation that lives in the like Principle, to put a stop to the entrance of those Vices that arise from the superfluity of Riches, by keeping their Kings in that honest Poverty, which is the Mother and Nurse of Modesty, Sobriety, and all manner of Vertue: And no man can deny this to be well done, unless he will affirm that Pride, Luxury and Vice is more profitable to a Nation than the Vertues that are upheld by frugality.</P>
<P>There is another reason of no less importance to those Nations, who tho they think fit to have Kings, yet desire to preserve their Liberty, which obliges them to set limits to the Glory, Power and Riches of their Kings; and that is, That they can no otherwise be kept within the Rules of the Law. Men are naturally propense to corruption; and if he whose Will and Interest it is to corrupt them, be furnish'd with the means, he will never fail to do it. Power, Honors, Riches, and the Pleasures that attend them, are the baits by which men are drawn to prefer a personal Interest before the publick Good; and the number of those who covet them is so great, that he who abounds in them will be able to gain so many to his service as shall be sufficient to subdue the rest. 'Tis hard to find a Tyranny in the world that has not bin introduc'd this way: for no man by his own strength could ever subdue a multitude; none could ever bring many to be subservient to his ill designs, but by the rewards they receiv'd or hop'd. By this means <HI>Cesar</HI> accomplish'd his work, and over∣threw the Liberty of his Country, and with it all that was then good
<PB N="251" REF="257"/>
in the world. They who were corrupted in their minds, desir'd to put all the Power and Riches into his hands, that he might distribute them to such as serv'd him. And he who was nothing less than covetous in his own nature, desir'd Riches, that he might gain Followers; and by the plunder of <HI>Gaul</HI> he corrupted those that betray'd <HI>Rome</HI> to him. And tho I do not delight to speak of the Affairs of our own time, I desire those who know the present State of <HI>France</HI> to tell me, whether it were possible for the King to keep that Nation under servitude, if a vast Revenue did not enable him to gain so many to his particular service as are sufficient to keep the rest in subjection: and if this be not enough, let them consider whether all the dangers that now threaten us at home, do not proceed from the madness of those who gave such a Revenue, as is utterly un∣proportionable to the Riches of the Nation, unsutable to the modest be∣haviour expected from our Kings, and which in time will render Parlia∣ments unnecessary to them.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the poverty and simplicity of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings was no less safe and profitable to the People than truly glorious to them. <HI>Agesilaus</HI> deny'd that <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> was greater than he, unless he were more temperate or more valiant; and he made good his words so well, that without any other assistance than what his Wisdom and Valor af∣forded, he struck such a terror into that great, rich, powerful and abso∣lute Monarch, that he did not think himself safe in <HI>Babylon</HI> or <HI>Ecbatane,</HI> till the poor <HI>Spartan</HI> was, by a Captain of as great valor, and greater poverty, oblig'd to return from <HI>Asia</HI> to the defence of his own Country. This was not peculiar to the severe <HI>Laconic</HI> Disciplin. When the <HI>Roman</HI> Kings were expel'd, a few Carts were prepar'd to transport their goods: and their Lands, which were consecrated to <HI>Mars,</HI> and now go under the name of <HI>Campus Martius,</HI> hardly contain ten Acres of ground. Nay the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> who led such vast Armys into the field (that is, were follow'd by all the people who were able to bear Arms) seem to have pos∣sest little. <HI>Ahab,</HI> one of the most powerful, was so fond of <HI>Naboth</HI>'s Vineyard (which being the Inheritance of his Fathers, according to their equal division of Lands, could not be above two Acres) that he grew sick when it was refus'd.</P>
<P>But if an allowance is to be made to every King, it must be either ac∣cording to a universal Rule or Standard, or must depend upon the Judgment of Nations. If the first, they who have it, may do well to produce it; if the other, every Nation proceeding according to the measure of their own discretion, is free from blame.</P>
<P>It may also be worth observation, whether the Revenue given to a King be in such manner committed to his care, that he is oblig'd to em∣ploy it for the publick Service without the power of Alienation; or whe∣ther it be granted as a Propriety, to be spent as he thinks fit. When some of the antient Jews and Christians scrupled the paiment of Tribute to the Emperors, the reasons alledg'd to persuade them to a compliance, seem to be grounded upon a supposition of the first: for, said they, the defence of the State lies upon them, which cannot be perform'd without Armys and Garisons; these cannot be maintain'd without pay, nor mony rais'd to pay them without Tributes and Customs. This carrys a face of reason with it, especially in those Countrys which are perpetually or fre∣quently subject to Invasions; but this will not content our Author. He speaks of employing the revenue in keeping the Kings House, and looks upon it as a propriety to be spent as he thinks convenient: which is no less
<PB N="252" REF="258"/>
 than to cast it into a Pit, of which no man ever knew the bottom. That which is given one day, is squander'd away the next: The people are always opprest with Impositions, to foment the Vices of the Court: These daily increasing, they grow insatiable, and the miserable Nations are compel'd to hard Labor, in order to satiate those Lusts that tend to their own ruin.</P>
<P>It may be consider'd that the vertuous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Saevior armis</L>
<L>Luxuria incubuit, victum{que} ulciscitur orbem. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE> Pagans, by the light of Na∣ture, discover'd the truth of this. Poverty grew odious in <HI>Rome,</HI> when great men by desiring Riches put a value upon them, and introduc'd that pomp and luxury which could not be born by men of small Fortunes. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Nullum crimen abest, facinus{que} libidinis, ex quo</L>
<L>Paupertas Romana perit. <BIBL>Juvenal.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE> From thence all furys and mischiefs seem'd to break loose: The base, slavish, and so often subdu'd <HI>Asia,</HI> by the basest of men reveng'd the de∣feats they had receiv'd from the bravest; and by infusing into them a de∣light in pomp and luxury, in a short time render'd the strongest and brav∣est of Nations the weakest and basest. I wish our own experience did not too plainly manifest, that these Evils were never more prevalent than in our days, when the luxury, majestick pomp, and absolute power of a neighbouring King must be supported by an abundance of Riches torn out of the bowels of his Subjects, which renders them in the best Coun∣try of the World, and at a time when the Crown most flourishes, the poorest and most miserable of all the Nations under the Sun. We too well know who are most apt to learn from them, and by what means and steps they endeavour to lead us into the like misery. But the Bird is safe when the Snare is discover'd; and if we are not abandon'd by God to de∣struction, we shall never be brought to consent to the settling of that Pomp, which is against the practice of all vertuous people, and has brought all the Nations that have bin taken with it into the ruin that is intended for us.</P>

<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VII. When the <HI>Israelites</HI> ask'd for such a King as the Nations about them had, they ask'd for a Tyrant, tho they did not call him so.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NOW that</HI> Saul <HI>was no Tyrant,</HI> says our Author, <HI>note, that the people ask'd a King as all Nations had: God answers, and bids</HI> Samuel <HI>to hear the voice of the People in all things which they spake, and appoint them a King. They did not ask a Tyrant; and to give them a Tyrant when they ask'd a King, had not bin to hear their voice in all things, but rather when they ask'd an Egg to have given them a Scorpion; unless we will say that all Nations had Tyrants.</HI> But before he drew such a Conclusion, he should have observ'd, that God did not give them a Scorpion when they ask'd an Egg, but told them that was a Scorpion which they call'd an Egg: They would have a King to judg them, to go out before them, and to fight their Battels; but God in effect told them, he would overthrow all Justice,
<PB N="253" REF="259"/>
and turn the Power that was given him, to the ruin of them and their Po∣sterity. But since they would have it so, he commanded <HI>Samuel</HI> to hear∣ken to their Voice, and for the punishment of their sin and folly to give them such a King as they ask'd, that is, one who would turn to his own profit and their misery, the Power with which he should be entrusted; and this truly denominates a Tyrant. <HI>Aristotle</HI> makes no other distinction between a King and a Tyrant, than that <HI>the King governs for the good of the People, the Tyrant for his own pleasure or profit:</HI> and they who ask'd such a one, ask'd a Tyrant, tho they call'd him a King. This is all could be done in their Language: for as they who are skill'd in the Oriental Tongues assure me, there is no name for a Tyrant in any of them, or any other way of expressing the thing than by circumlocution, and adding proud, insolent, lustful, cruel, violent, or the like Epithets, to the word Lord, or King. They did in effect ask a Tyrant: They would not have such a King as God had ordain'd, but such a one as the Nations had. Not that all Nations had Tyrants; but those who were round about them, of whom they had knowledg, and which in their manner of speaking went under the name of all, were blest with such Masters. This way of expression was us'd by <HI>Lot</HI>'s Daughters, who said, There was not a man in all the earth to come in to them; because there was none in the neighborhood with whom it was thought fit they should accompany. Now that the Eastern Nations were then, and are still under the Govern∣ment of those which all free People call Tyrants, is evident to all men. God therefore in giving them a Tyrant, or rather a Government that would turn into Tyranny, gave them what they ask'd under another name; and without any blemish to the Mercy promis'd to their Fathers, suffer'd them to bear the penalty of their wickedness and folly in rejecting him that he should not reign over them.</P>
<P>But tho the name of Tyrant was unknown to them, yet in <HI>Greece,</HI> from whence the word comes, it signify'd no more than one who go∣vern'd according to his own will, distinguish'd from Kings that govern'd by Law; and was not taken in an ill sense, till those who had bin ad∣vanc'd for their Justice, Wisdom and Valor, or their Descendents, were found to depart from the ends of their Institution, and to turn that Power to the oppression of the people, which had bin given for their protection. But by these means it grew odious, and that kind of Government came to be thought only tolerable by the basest of men; and those who destroy'd it, were in all places esteem'd to be the best.</P>
<P>If Monarchy had bin universally evil, God had not in the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deu∣teronomy</HI> given leave to the <HI>Israelites</HI> to set up a King; and if that kind of King had bin ask'd, he had not bin displeas'd: and they could not have bin said to reject God, if they had not ask'd that which was evil; for nothing that is good is contrary, or inconsistent with a peoples obedi∣ence to him. The Monarchy they ask'd was displeasing to God, it was therefore evil. But a Tyrant is no more than an evil or corrupted Mo∣narch: The King therefore that they demanded was a Tyrant: God in granting one who would prove a Tyrant, gave them what they ask'd; and that they might know what they did, and what he would be, he told 'em they rejected him, and should cry by reason of the King they desir'd.</P>
<P>This denotes him to be a Tyrant: for as the Government of a King ought to be gentle and easy, tending to the good of the people, resembling the tender care of a Father to his Family; if he who is set up to be a
<PB N="254" REF="260"/>
 King, and to be like to that Father, dos lay a heavy Yoke upon the peo∣ple, and use them as Slaves and not as Children, he must renounce all resemblance of a Father, and be accounted an Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>But,</HI> says our Author, <HI>whereas the peoples crying argues some tyrannical oppression, we may remember that the peoples Crys are not always an Argument of their living under a Tyrant. No man will say</HI> Solomon <HI>was a Tyrant, yet all the Congregation complain'd that</HI> Solomon <HI>made their Yoke grievous.</HI> 'Tis strange, that when Children, nay when Whelps cry, it should be accounted a mark that they are troubled, and that the Cry of the whole People should be none: Or that the Government which is erected for their ease, should not be esteem'd tyrannical if it prove grievous to those it should relieve. But as I know no example of a People that did generally complain without cause, our Adversarys must alledg some other than that of <HI>Solomon,</HI> before I believe it of any. We are to speak reverently of him: He was excellent in Wisdom; he built the Temple, and God ap∣pear'd twice to him: But it must be confest, that during a great part of his life he acted directly contrary to the Law given by God to Kings, and that his ways were evil and oppressive to the people, if those of God were good. Kings were forbidden to multiply Horses, Wives, Silver and Gold: But he brought together more Silver and Gold, and provided more Horses, Wives and Concubines than any man is known to have had: And tho he did not actually return to <HI>Egypt,</HI> yet he introduc'd their abominable Idolatry, and so far rais'd his heart above his Brethren, that he made them subservient to his Pomp and Glory. The People might pro∣bably be pleas'd with a great part of this; but when the Yoke became grievous, and his foolish Son would not render it more easy, they threw it off; and the thing being from the Lord, it was good, unless he be evil.</P>
<P>But as just Governments are establish'd for the good of the governed, and the <HI>Israelites</HI> desir'd a King, that it might be well with them, not with him who was not yet known to them; that which exalts one to the preju∣dice of those that made him, must always be evil, and the People that suffers the prejudice must needs know it better than any other. He that denies this, may think the state of <HI>France</HI> might have bin best known from <HI>Bulion</HI> the late Treasurer, who finding <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth to be troubled at the peoples misery, told him they were too happy, since they were not reduc'd to eat grass. But if words are to be understood as they are ordinarily us'd, and we have no other than that of <HI>Tyranny</HI> to express a Monarchy that is either evil in the institution, or fallen into corruption, we may justly call that <HI>Tyranny</HI> which the Scripture calls a <HI>grievous Yoke,</HI> and which neither the old nor the new Counsellors of <HI>Rehoboam</HI> could deny to be so; for tho the first advis'd him to promise amendment, and the others to do worse, yet all agreed that what the people said was true.</P>
<P>This Yoke is always odious to such as are not by natural stupidity and baseness fitted for it; but those who are so, never complain. An Ass will bear a multitude of blows patiently, but the least of them drives a Lion into rage. He that said, the rod is made for the back of fools, con∣fest that oppression will make a wise man mad. And the most unnatu∣ral of all oppressions is to use Lions like Asses, and to lay that Yoke upon a generous Nation, which only the basest can deserve; and for want of a better word we call this Tyranny.</P>
<P>Our Author is not contented to vindicate <HI>Solomon</HI> only, but extends his Indulgence to <HI>Saul.</HI> His custom is to patronize all that is detestable, and no better testimony could be given of it. <HI>It is true,</HI> says he, <HI>Saul lost his</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
<HI>Kingdom, but not for being too cruel or tyrannical to his Subjects, but for being too merciful to his Enemys.</HI> But he alledges no other reason, than that the slaughter of the Priests is not blam'd; not observing that the Writers of the Scripture in relating those things that are known to be abominable by the Light of Nature, frequently say no more of them: And if this be not so, <HI>Lot</HI>'s drunkenness and incest, <HI>Reuben</HI>'s pollution of his Fa∣ther's bed, <HI>Abimelech</HI>'s slaughter of his seventy Brothers, and many of the most wicked Acts that ever were committed, may pass for laudable and innocent. But if <HI>Saul</HI> were not to be blam'd for killing the Priests, why was <HI>David</HI> blam'd for the death of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thou hast killed <HI>Uriah</HI> with the Sword of the Children of <HI>Ammon:</HI> Now therefore the Sword shall never depart from thy House, <BIBL>2 Sam. 12.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Ʋriah?</HI> Why were the Dogs to lick the blood of <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Jezebel,</HI> if they did nothing more than Kings might do without blame? Now if the slaughter of one man was so severely aveng'd upon the Authors and their Familys, none but such as <HI>Filmer</HI> can think that of so many innocent men, with their Wives and Children, could escape unreprov'd or unpunish'd. But the whole series of the Histo∣ry of <HI>Saul</HI> shewing evidently that his Life and Reign were full of the most violent cruelty and madness, we are to seek no other reason for the ruin threaten'd and brought upon him and his Family. And as those Princes who are most barbarously savage against their own people, are usually most gentle to the Enemys of their Country, he could not give a more certain testimony of his hatred to those he ought to have pro∣tected, than by preserving those Nations who were their most irrecon∣cilable Enemies. This is prov'd by reason as well as by experience; for every man knows he cannot bear the hatred of all mankind: Such as know they have Enemys abroad, endeavour to get Friends at home: Those who command powerful Nations, and are belov'd by them, fear not to offend Strangers. But if they have render'd their own people Enemys to them, they cannot hope for help in a time of distress, nor so much as a place of retreat or refuge, unless from strangers, nor from them unless they deserve it, by favoring them to the prejudice of their own Country. As no man can serve two Masters, no man can pursue two contrary Inte∣rests. <HI>Moses, Joshua, Gideon</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> were severe to the <HI>Amorites, Midianites</HI> and <HI>Cananites,</HI> but mild and gentle to the <HI>Hebrews. Saul,</HI> who was cruel to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> spar'd the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> whose preservation was their destruction: and whilst he destroy'd those he should have sav'd, and sav'd those that by a general and particular command of God he should have destroy'd, he lost his ill govern'd Kingdom, and left an example to posterity of the end that may be expected from pride, folly and tyranny.</P>
<P>The matter would not be much alter'd, if I should confess, that in the time of <HI>Saul</HI> all Nations were govern'd by Tyrants (tho it is not true, for <HI>Greece</HI> did then flourish in Liberty, and we have reason to be∣lieve that other Nations did so also) for tho they might not think of a good Government at the first, nothing can oblige men to continue under one that is bad, when they discover the evils of it, and know how to mend it. They who trusted men that appear'd to have great Vertues, with such a power as might easily be turn'd into Tyranny, might justly retract, limit or abolish it, when they found it to be abus'd. And tho no condition had bin reserv'd, the publick Good, which is the end of all <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Salus populi suprema Lex.</NOTE>Government,
<PB N="256" REF="262"/>
 had bin sufficient to abrogate all that should tend to the contrary. As the malice of Men and their Inventions to do mischief increase daily, all would soon be brought under the power of the worst, if care were not taken, and opportunitys embrac'd to find new ways of preventing it. He that should make War at this day as the best Commanders did two hundred years past, would be beaten by the meanest Soldier. The Pla∣ces then accounted impregnable are now slighted as indefensible; and if the Arts of defending were not improv'd as well as those of assaulting, none would be able to hold out a day. Men were sent into the World rude and ignorant; and if they might not have us'd their natural Facultys to find out that which is good for themselves, all must have bin condemn'd to continue in the ignorance of our first Fathers, and to make no use of their understanding to the ends for which it was given.</P>
<P>The bestial Barbarity in which many Nations, especially of <HI>Africa, America</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> do now live, shews what human Nature is, if it be not improv'd by Art and Disciplin: and if the first errors, committed thro ignorance, might not be corrected, all would be oblig'd to continue in them; and for any thing I know, we must return to the Religion, Manners and Policy that were found in our Country at <HI>Cesar</HI>'s landing. To affirm this is no less than to destroy all that is commendable in the world, and to render the understanding given to men utterly useless. But if it be lawful for us by the use of that understanding to build Hou∣ses, Ships and Forts better than our Ancestors, to make such Arms as are most fit for our defence, and to invent Printing, with an infinite number of other Arts beneficial to mankind, why have we not the same right in mat∣ters of Government, upon which all others do almost absolutely depend? If men are not oblig'd to live in Caves and hollow Trees, to eat Acorns, and to go naked, why should they be for ever oblig'd to continue under the same form of Government that their Ancestors happen'd to set up in the time of their ignorance? Or if they were so ignorant to set up one that was not good enough for the age in which they liv'd, why should it not be alter'd, when tricks are found out to turn that to the prejudice of Na∣tions, which was erected for their good? From whence should malice and wickedness gain a privilege of putting new Inventions to do mischief every day into practice? and who is it that so far protects them, as to for∣bid good and innocent men to find new ways also of defending them∣selves? If there be any that do this, they must be such as live in the same principle; who whilst they pretend to exercise Justice, provide only for the indemnity of their own Crimes, and the advancement of unjust de∣signs. They would have a right of attacking us with all the advantages of the Arms now in use, and the Arts which by the practice of so many ages have bin wonderfully refin'd, whilst we should be oblig'd to employ no others in our just defence, than such as were known to our naked An∣cestors when <HI>Cesar</HI> invaded them, or to the <HI>Indians</HI> when they fell under the dominion of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> This would be a compendious way of placing uncontrol'd Iniquity in all the Kingdoms of the World, and of overthrowing all that deserves the name of Good by the introduction of such accursed Maxims. But if no man dares to acknowledg any such, except those whose acknowledgment is a discredit, we ought not to suffer them to be obliquely obtruded upon us, nor to think that God has so far abandon'd us into the hands of our Enemys, as not to leave us the liber∣ty of using the same Arms in our defence as they do to offend and in∣jure us.</P>

We shall be told, that Prayers and Tears were the only Arms of the first Christians, and that Christ commanded his Disciples to pray for those that persecuted them. But besides that those Precepts of the most extreme lenity do ill sute with the violent practices of those who attempt to enslave Nations, and who by alledging them do plainly shew either that they do not extend to all Christians, or that they themselves are none whilst they act contrary to them; they are to know, that those Precepts were merely temporary, and directed to the Persons of the Apostles, who were arm'd only with the sword of the Spirit; that the Primitive Christi∣ans us'd Prayers and Tears only no longer than whilst they had no other arms. But knowing that by listing themselves under the ensigns of Chri∣stianity they had not lost the rights belonging to all Mankind, when Na∣tions came to be converted, they no way thought themselves oblig'd to give their Enemys a certain opportunity of destroying them, when God had put means into their hands of defending themselves; and proceeded so far in this way, that the Christian Valor soon became no less famous and remarkable than that of the Pagans. They did with the utmost vi∣gor defend both their civil and religious Rights against all the Powers of Earth and Hell, who by force and fraud endeavour'd to destroy them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Under the name of Tribute no more is understood than what the Law of each Nation gives to the supreme Magistrate for the defraying of publick Charges; to which the Customs of the <HI>Romans,</HI> or suffer∣ings of the <HI>Jews</HI> have no relation.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IF any desire the directions of the New Testament,</HI> says our Author, <HI>he may find our Saviour limiting and distinguishing Royal Power, by giving to</HI> Cesar <HI>those things that are</HI> Cesar<HI>'s, and to God the things that are God's.</HI> But that will be of no advantage to him in this contest. We do not deny to any man that which is his due; but do not so well know who is <HI>Cesar,</HI> nor what it is that can truly be said to be due to him. I grant that when those words were spoken, the power of the <HI>Romans</HI> exercis'd by <HI>Tiberius</HI> was then exprest by the name of <HI>Cesar,</HI> which he without any Title had assum'd. The <HI>Jews</HI> amongst many other Nations having bin subdu'd, submitted to it; and being no way competent Judges of the rights belong∣ing to the Senat or People of <HI>Rome,</HI> were oblig'd to acknowledg that Power which their Masters were under. They had no Commonwealth of their own, nor any other Government among themselves, that was not precarious. They thought Christ was to have restor'd their King∣dom, and by them to have reign'd over the Nations; but he shew'd them they were to be subject to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and that within few years their City and Temple should be destroy'd. Their Commonwealth must needs expire when all that was prefigur'd by it was accomplish'd. It was not for them at such a time to presume upon their abrogated Privileges, nor the Promises made to them, which were then fulfil'd. Nay, they had by their Sins profan'd themselves, and given to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> a right over them, which none could have had, if they had continu'd in their obedi∣ence to the Law of God.

 over them, but can have no influence upon us. The first of the <HI>Cesars</HI> had not bin set up by them: The series of them had not bin conti∣nu'd by their consent: They had not interrupted the succession by placing or displacing such as they pleas'd: They had not brought in Strangers or Bastards, nor prefer'd the remotest in blood before the nearest: They had no part in making the Laws by which they were govern'd, nor had the <HI>Cesars</HI> sworn to them: They had no <HI>Great Charter,</HI> acknowledging their Libertys to be innate or inherent in them, confirm'd by immemorial Cus∣tom, and strengthen'd by thirty acts of their own general Assemblys, with the assent of the <HI>Romans:</HI> The <HI>Cesar</HI> who then govern'd came not to the power by their consent: The question, <HI>Will ye have this man to reign?</HI> had never bin ask'd; but he being impos'd upon them, they were to submit to the Laws by which he govern'd their Masters. This can be nothing to us, whose case is in every respect most unlike to theirs. We have no Dictatorian Power over us; and neither we nor our Fathers have render'd or ow'd obedience to any human Laws but our own, nor to any other Magistracy than what we have establish'd. We have a King who reigns by Law. His power is from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lex facit ut sit Rex. <BIBL>Bracton.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Law that makes him King:</HI> and we can know only from thence what he is to command, and what we are oblig'd to obey. We know the power of the <HI>Cesars</HI> was usurp'd, maintain'd and exercis'd with the most detestable violence, injustice and cruelty. But tho it had bin establish'd by the consent of the <HI>Romans,</HI> from an opinion that it was good for them in that state of affairs, it were no∣thing to us: and we could be no more oblig'd to follow their example in that, than to be govern'd by Consuls, Tribuns, and <HI>Decemviri,</HI> or to constitute such a Government as they set up when they expel'd their Kings. Their Authority was as good at one time as at the other; or if a difference ought to be made, the preference is to be given to what they did when their Manners were most pure, the People most free, and when Vertue was most flourishing among them. But if we are not oblig'd to set up such a Magistracy as they had, 'tis ridiculous to think that such an obedience is due to one who is not in being as they paid to him that was. And if I should confess that <HI>Cesar</HI> holding the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> under the power of the Sword, impos'd what tribute he pleas'd upon the Provin∣ces; and that the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had no part in the Government, were oblig'd to submit to his will, our liberty of paying nothing, except what the Parliament appoints, and yielding obedience to no Laws but such as are made to be so by their Authority, or by our own immemorial Customs, could not be thereby infring'd. But we may justly affirm, that the Tri∣bute impos'd was not, as our Author infers, <HI>all their Coin,</HI> nor a conside∣rable part of it, nor more than what was understood to go for the defray∣ing of the publick Charges. Christ by asking whose Image and Super∣scription was stampt upon their Mony, and thereupon commanding them to give to <HI>Cesar</HI> that which was <HI>Cesar</HI>'s, did not imply that all was his; but that <HI>Cesar</HI>'s Mony being current amongst them, it was a continual and evident testimony, that they acknowledg'd themselves to be under his jurisdiction, and therefore could not refuse to pay the Tribute laid upon them by the same Authority, as other Nations did.</P>
<P>It may also be observ'd, that Christ did not so much say this to deter∣min the questions that might arise concerning <HI>Cesar</HI>'s Power; for he plain∣ly
<PB N="259" REF="267" MS="y"/>
says, that was not his work; but to put the <HI>Pharisees</HI> to silence who tempted him. According to the opinion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that the Messias would restore the Kingdom of <HI>Israel,</HI> they thought his first work would be to throw off the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke; and not believing him to be the man, they would have brought him to avow the thing, that they might destroy him. But as that was not his business, and that his time was not yet come, it was not necessary to give them any other answer, than such as might disappoint their purpose. This shews that, without detracting from the honor due to <HI>Austin, Ambrose,</HI> or <HI>Tertullian,</HI> I may justly say, that the decision of such questions as arise concerning our Government must be decided by our Laws, and not by their Writings. They were excellent Men; but living in another time, under a very different Go∣vernment, and applying themselves to other matters, they had no know∣ledg at all of those that concern us. They knew what Government they were under, and thereupon judg'd what a broken and dispers'd People ow'd to that which had given Law to the best part of the World before they were in being, under which they had bin educated, and which after a most cruel persecution was become propitious to them. They knew that the Word of the Emperor was a Law to the Senat and People, who were under the power of that man that could get the best Army; but perhaps had never heard of such mix'd Governments as ours, tho about that time they began to appear in the world. And it might be as rea∣sonably concluded, that there ought to be no rule in the Succession or Election of Princes, because the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors were set up by the vio∣lence of the Soldiers, and for the most part by the slaughter of him who was in possession of the Power, as that all other Princes must be absolute when they have it, and do what they please, till another more strong and more happy may by the like means wrest the same Power from them.</P>
<P>I am much mistaken if this be not true; but without prejudice to our Cause, we may take that which they say, according to their true mean∣ing, in the utmost extent. And to begin with <HI>Tertullian:</HI> 'Tis good to consider the subject of his Discourse, and to whom he wrote. The Trea∣tise cited by our Author is the <HI>Apologetick,</HI> and tends to persuade the Pa∣gans, that Civil Magistrats might not intermeddle with Religion; and that the Laws made by them touching those matters, were of no value, as relating to things of which they had no cognizance. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leges non annorum numerus, nec conditorum dignitas, sed sola aequitas commendat; at{que} ideo si iniquae cognoscuntur, merito damnantur. <BIBL>Tertul. Ap.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>'Tis not,</HI> says he, <HI>length of time, nor the dignity of the Legislators, but equity only that can commend Laws; and when any are found to be unjust, they are deservedly con∣demn'd.</HI> By which words he deny'd that the Magistratical Power which the <HI>Romans</HI> acknowledg'd in <HI>Cesar,</HI> had any thing to do in spiritual things. And little advantage can be taken by Christian Princes from what he says concerning the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors; for he expresly declares, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sed &amp; Caesares super Christo credidissent, si aut Caesares non essent saeculo necessarii, aut Chri∣stiani potuissent esse Caesares. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>That the</HI> Cesars <HI>would have believ'd in Christ, if they had either not bin necessary to the secular Government, or that Christians might have bin</HI> Cesars. This seems to have proceeded from an opinion receiv'd by Christians in the first Ages, that the use of the Civil as well as the Military Sword was
<PB N="260" REF="268"/>
 equally accurs'd: That <HI>Christians were to be</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Filii pacis, nullius hostes; &amp; Christus exarmando Petrum, omnem Christianum militem in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aeteranum discinxit. <BIBL>Tertul. ibid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Sons of peace, Enemys to no man; and that Christ by commanding</HI> Peter <HI>to put up his Sword, did for ever disarm all Christians.</HI> He proceeds to say, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nobis omnis gloriae &amp; dignitatis ardore frigentibus, &amp;c. Nec alia res est nobis magis aliena quam publica: Unam nobis Rempublicam Mundum agnoscimus. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>We cannot fight to de∣fend our Goods, having in our Baptism renounc'd the World, and all that is in it; nor to gain Honors, accounting nothing more foreign to us than pub∣lick Affairs, and acknowledging no other Commonwealth than that of the whole World; nor to save our lives, because we account it a happiness to be kill'd.</HI> He dissuades the <HI>Pagans</HI> from executing Christians, rather from charity to them in keeping them from the crime of slaughtering the Innocent, than that they were unwilling to suffer: and gives no other reasons of their Prayers for the Emperors, than that they were commanded to love their Enemys, and to pray for those who persecuted them, except such as he drew from a mistake, that the World was shortly to finish with the dissolution of the Empire. All his Works, as well those that were writ∣ten before he fell into Montanism, as those publish'd afterwards, are full of the like Opinions: and if <HI>Filmer</HI> acknowledges them to be true, he must confess, That Princes are not Fathers, but <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qui enim magis inimici Christianorum, quam de quorum Majestate conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimur in crimen. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>Enemys; and that not only they, but all those who render themselves Ministers of the Powers they execute, in taking upon them the Sword that Christ had curs'd, do re∣nounce him; and we may consider how to proceed with such as do so. If our Author will not acknowledg this, then no man was ever guilty of a more vile prevarication than he, who alledges those words in favor of his Cause, which have their only strength in Opinions that he thinks false, and in the Authority of a man whom in that very thing he condemns; and must do so, or overthrow all that he endeavours to support. But <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Opinions concerning these matters have no relation to our pre∣sent Question. The design of his Apology, and the Treatise to <HI>Scapula</HI> almost upon the same subject, was to show, that the Civil Magistracy which he comprehends under the name of <HI>Cesar,</HI> had nothing to do with matters of Religion; and that, as no man could be a Christian who would undertake the work of a Magistrate, they who were jealous the publick Offices might be taken out of their hands, had nothing to fear from Christians who resolv'd not to meddle with them. Whereas our question is only, Whether that Magistratical Power, which by Law or Usurpation was then in <HI>Cesar,</HI> must necessarily in all times, and in all places, be in one man, or may be divided and balanc'd according to the Laws of every Country, concerning which he says nothing: Or whe∣ther we, who do not renounce the use of the Civil or Military Sword, who have a part in the Government, and think it our duty to apply our selves to publick Cares, should lay them aside because the antient Christi∣ans every hour expecting death, did not trouble themselves with them.</P>
<P>If <HI>Ambrose</HI> after he was a Bishop, employ'd the ferocity of a Soldier, which he still retain'd, rather in advancing the power of the Clergy, than the good of Mankind by restraining the rage of Tyrants, it can be no prejudice to our Cause, of which he had no cognisance. He spoke of the violent and despotical Government, to which he had bin a Minister
<PB N="261" REF="269"/>
before his Baptism, and seems to have had no knowledg of the <HI>Gothick</HI> Polity, that within a few years grew famous by the overthrow of the <HI>Roman</HI> Tyranny, and delivering the world from the Yoke which it could no longer bear. And if <HI>Austin</HI> might say, That <HI>the Emperor is subject to no Laws, because he has a Power of making Laws;</HI> I may justly say, that our Kings are subject to Laws, because they can make no Law, and have no Power but what is given by the Laws. If this be not the case, I desire to know who made the Laws, to which they and their Predecessors have sworn; and whether they can according to their own will abrogate those antient Laws, by which they are made to be what they are, and by which we enjoy what we have; or whether they can make new Laws by their own Power? If no man but our Author have impudence enough to assert any such thing; and if all the Kings we ever had, except <HI>Richard</HI> the second, did renounce it, we may conclude that <HI>Austin</HI>'s words have no relation to our dispute; and that 'twere to no purpose to examin, whether the Fathers mention any reservation of Power to the Laws of the Land, or to the People; it being as lawful for all Nations, if they think fit, to frame Governments different from those that were then in being, as to build Bastions, Halfmoons, Hornworks, Ravelins or Counterscarps, or to make use of Muskets, Cannon, Mortars, Carabines or Pistols, which were unknown to them.</P>
<P>What <HI>Solomon</HI> says of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Kings, dos as little concern us. We have already prov'd their Power not to have bin absolute, tho greater than that which the Law allows to ours. It might upon occasion be a prudent advice to private persons living under such Governments as were usual in the Eastern Countrys, <HI>to keep the King's Commandments, and not to say, What dost thou? because where the Word of a King is, there is Power, and all that he pleaseth he will do.</HI> But all these words are not his; and those that are, must not be taken in a general sense; for tho his Son was a King, yet in his words there was no power: He could not do what he pleas'd, nor hinder others from doing what they pleas'd: He would have added weight to the Yoke that lay upon the necks of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> but he could not; and we do not find him to have bin master of much more than his own Tongue, to speak as many foolish things as he pleas'd. In other things, whether he had to deal with his own people, or with stran∣gers, he was weak and impotent; and the wretches who flatter'd him in his follys, could be of no help to him. The like has befallen many o∣thers: Those who are wise, vertuous, valiant, just, and lovers of their People, have and ought to have Power; but such as are leud, vicious, foolish, and haters of their People, ought to have none, and are often depriv'd of all. This was well known to <HI>Solomon,</HI> who says, That <HI>a wise Child is better than an old and foolish King that will not be advis'd.</HI> When <HI>Nabuchodonosor</HI> set himself in the place of God, his Kingdom was taken from him, and he was driven from the society of men to herd with beasts. There was Power for a time in the word of <HI>Nero:</HI> he murder'd many excellent men; but he was call'd to account, and the World aban∣don'd the Monster it had too long endur'd. He found none to defend him, nor any better help, when he desir'd to die, than the hand of a Slave. Besides, some Kings by their Institution have little Power; some have bin depriv'd of what they had, for abusing, or rendring themselves unworthy of it; and Historys afford us innumerable examples of both sorts.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="270"/>
 But tho I should confess that there is always Power in the word of a King, it would be nothing to us who dispute concerning Right, and have no regard to that Power which is void of it. A Thief or a Pyrat may have Power: but that avails him not, when, as often befel the <HI>Cesars,</HI> he meets with one who has more; and is always unsafe, since having no effect upon the Consciences of men, every one may destroy him that can. And I leave it to Kings to consider how much they stand oblig'd to those, who placing their Rights upon the same foot, expose their Persons to the same dangers.</P>
<P>But if Kings desire that in their Word there should be power, let them take care that it be always accompany'd with Truth and Justice. Let them seek the good of their People, and the hands of all good men will be with them. Let them not exalt themselves insolently, and every one will desire to exalt them. Let them acknowledg themselves to be the Servants of the Publick, and all men will be theirs. Let such as are most addicted to them, talk no more of <HI>Cesars,</HI> nor the Tributes due to them. We have nothing to do with the name of <HI>Cesar.</HI> They who at this day live under it, reject the Prerogatives antiently usurp'd by those who had it, and are govern'd by no other Laws than their own. We know no Law to which we owe obedience, but that of God, and our selves. <HI>Asia∣tick</HI> Slaves usually pay such Tributes as are impos'd upon them; and whilst braver Nations lay under the <HI>Roman</HI> Tyranny, they were forc'd to submit to the same burdens. But even those Tributes were paid for maintaining Armys, Fleets and Garisons, without which the poor and abject life they led could not have bin preserv'd. We owe none but what we freely give. None is or can be impos'd upon us, unless by our selves. We measure our Grants according to our own Will, or the present occa∣sions, for our own safety. Our Ancestors were born free, and, as the best provision they could make for us, they left us that Liberty intire, with the best Laws they could devise to defend it. 'Tis no way impair'd by the Opinions of the Fathers. The words of <HI>Solomon</HI> do rather confirm it. The happiness of those who enjoy the like, and the shameful misery under which they lie, who have suffer'd themselves to be forc'd or cheated out of it, may persuade, and the justice of the Cause encourage us to think no∣thing too dear to be hazarded in the defence of it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX. Our own Laws confirm to us the enjoyment of our native Rights.</HEAD>
<P>IF that which our Author calls Divinity did reach the things in dispute between us, or that the Opinions of the Fathers which he alledges, related to them, he might have spar'd the pains of examining our Laws: for a municipal Sanction were of little force to confirm a perpetual and universal Law given by God to mankind, and of no value against it, since man cannot abrogate what God has instituted, nor one Nation free it self from a Law that is given to all. But having abus'd the Scriptures, and the Writings of the Fathers, (whose Opinions are to be valu'd only so far as they rightly interpret them) he seems desirous to try whether he can as well put a false sense upon our Law. According to his custom he
<PB N="263" REF="271"/>
takes pieces of passages from good Books, and turns them directly against the plain meaning of the Authors, exprest in the whole scope and design of their Writings. To show that he intends to spare none, he is not a∣sham'd to cite <HI>Bracton,</HI> who of all our antient Law-writers is most oppo∣site to his Maxims. He liv'd, says he, in <HI>Henry</HI> the third's time, since Parliamenns were instituted: as if there had bin a time when <HI>England</HI> had wanted them; or that the establishment of our Liberty had bin made by the <HI>Normans,</HI> who, if we will believe our Author, came in by force of Arms, and opprest us. But we have already prov'd the Essence of Par∣liaments to be as antient as our Nation, and that there was no time in which there were not such Councils or Assemblys of the People as had the power of the whole, and made or unmade such Laws as best pleas'd themselves. We have indeed a <HI>French</HI> word from a People that came from <HI>France,</HI> but the Power was always in our selves: and the <HI>Norman</HI> Kings were oblig'd to swear they would govern according to the Laws that had bin made by those Assemblys. It imports little whether <HI>Bracton</HI> liv'd before or after they came amongst us. His words are, <HI>Omnes sub eo, &amp; ipse sub nullo, sed tantum sub Deo; All are under him, and he under none but God only. If he offend, since no Writ can go out against him, their Remedy is by petitioning him to amend his Faults; which if he will not do, it is punishment enough for him to expect God as an avenger. Let none presume to look into his Deeds, much less to oppose him.</HI> Here is a mixture of Sense and Nonsense, Truth and Falshood, the words of <HI>Bracton,</HI> with our Author's foolish Inferences from them. <HI>Bracton</HI> spoke of the politick ca∣pacity of the King, when no Law had forbidden him to divide it from his natural. He gave the name of King to the sovereign Power of the Nation, as <HI>Jacob</HI> call'd that of his Descendents The Scepter; which he said should not depart from <HI>Judah</HI> till <HI>Shiloh</HI> came, tho all men know that his Race did not reign the third part of that time over his own Tribe, nor full sourscore years over the whole Nation. The same man∣ner of speech is us'd in all parts of the world. <HI>Tertullian</HI> under the name of <HI>Cesar</HI> comprehended all magistratical Power, and imputed to him the Acts of which in his person he never had any knowledg. The <HI>French</HI> say, their King is always present, <HI>sur son lit de justice,</HI> in all the Sovereign Courts of the Kingdom, which are not easily number'd; and that Max∣im could have in it neither sense nor truth, if by it they meant a Man, who can be but in one place at one time, and is always comprehended within the Dimensions of his own Skin. These things could not be un∣known to <HI>Bracton,</HI> the like being in use amongst us; and he thought it no offence so far to follow the dictates of Reason prohibited by no Law, as to make a difference between the invisible and omnipresent King, who never dies, and the Person that wears the Crown, whom no man with∣out the guilt of Treason may endeavour to kill since there is an Act of Parliament in the case.

But the grossest of his follys is yet more pardonable than his detestable fraud in falsifying <HI>Bracton</HI>'s words, and leaving out such as are not for his purpose, which shew his meaning to be directly contrary to the sense put upon them. That this may appear, I shall set down the words as they are found in <HI>Bracton: Ipse autem Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo, &amp; sub Lege, quia Lex facit Regem. Attribuat ergo Rex Legi quod Lex attribuit ei, id est domina∣tionem &amp; potestatem: Non est enim Rex ubi dominatur voluntas &amp; non Lex; &amp; quod sub Lege esse debeat, cum sit Dei vicarius, evidenter apparet.</HI> If <HI>Bracton</HI> therefore be a competent Judg, the King is under the Law; and he is not a King, nor God's Vicegerent unless he be so; and we all know how to proceed with those who being under the Law, offend against it. For the Law is not made in vain. In this case something more is to be done than petitioning; and 'tis ridiculous to say, that if <HI>he will not amend, 'tis punishment enough for him to expect God an Avenger:</HI> for the same may be said of all Malefactors. God can sufficiently punish Thieves and Mur∣derers: but the future Judgment, of which perhaps they have no belief, is not sufficient to restrain them from committing more Crimes, nor to deter others from following their example. God was always able to pu∣nish Murderers, but yet by his Law he commands man to shed the blood of him who should shed man's blood; and declares that the Land cannot be purg'd of the Guilt by any other means. He had Judgments in store for <HI>Jeroboam, Ahab,</HI> and those that were like them; but yet he com∣manded, that, according to that Law, their Houses should be destroy'd from the earth. The dogs lick'd up the blood of <HI>Ahab,</HI> where they had lick'd that of <HI>Naboth,</HI> and eat <HI>Jezebel</HI> who had contriv'd his murder. <HI>But,</HI> says our Author, <HI>we must not look into his deeds, much less oppose them.</HI> Must not <HI>David</HI> look into <HI>Saul</HI>'s deeds, nor oppose them? Why did he then bring together as many men as he could to oppose, and make fo∣reign Alliances against him, even with the <HI>Moabites</HI> and the accursed <HI>Philistins?</HI> Why did <HI>Jehu</HI> not only destroy <HI>Ahab</HI>'s house, but kill the King of <HI>Judah</HI> and his forty Brothers, only for going to visit his Chil∣dren? Our Author may perhaps say, because God commanded them. But if God commanded them to do so, he did not command them and all mankind not to do so; and if he did not forbid, they have nothing to re∣strain them from doing the like, unless they have made municipal Laws of their own to the contrary, which our Author and his Followers may produce when they can find them.</P>

His next work is to go back again to the Tribute paid by Christ to <HI>Cesar,</HI> and judiciously to infer, that all Nations must pay the same Duty to their Magistrats, as the <HI>Jews</HI> did to the <HI>Romans</HI> who had sub∣du'd them. <HI>Christ did not,</HI> says he, <HI>ask what the Law of the Land was, nor inquire whether there was a Statute against it, nor whether the Tribute were given by the consent of the People, but upon sight of the superscription concluded,</HI> &amp;c. It had bin strange if Christ had inquir'd after their Laws, Statutes or Consent, when he knew that their Common∣wealth, with all the Laws by which it had subsisted, was abolish'd; and that <HI>Israel</HI> was become a Servant to those who exercis'd a most violent domination over them: which being a peculiar punishment for their peculiar sins, can have no influence upon Nations that are not under the same circumstances.</P>
<P>But of all that he says, nothing is more incomprehensible, than what he can mean by lawful Kings to whom all is due that was due to the <HI>Roman</HI> Usurpers. For lawful Kings are Kings by the Law: In being Kings by the Law they are such Kings as the Law makes them, and that Law only must tell us what is due to them; or by a univer∣sal Patriarchical Right, to which no man can have a title, as is said before, till he prove himself to be the right Heir of <HI>Noah.</HI> If neither of these are to be regarded, but that Right follows Possession, there is no such thing as a Usurper; he who has the Power has the Right, as in∣deed <HI>Filmer</HI> says, and his Wisdom as well as his Integrity is sufficiently declar'd by the Assertion.</P>
<P>This wicked extravagancy is follow'd by an attempt of as singular ignorance and stupidity, to shuffle together Usurpers and Conquerors, as if they were the same; whereas there have bin many Usurpers who were not Conquerors, and Conquerors that deserv'd not the name of Usurpers. No wise man ever said that <HI>Agathocles</HI> or <HI>Dionysius</HI> con∣quer'd <HI>Syracuse; Tarquin, Galba</HI> or <HI>Otho, Rome; Cromwel, England;</HI> or that the <HI>Magi,</HI> who seiz'd the Government of <HI>Persia</HI> after the death of <HI>Cambyses,</HI> conquer'd that Country.

There is such a thing amongst men as just War, or else ttue Valor could not be a Vertue but a Crime; and instead of glory, the utmost infamy would always be the companion of Victory. There are, says <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belli aque ac pacis jura. <BIBL>De jur. bel. &amp; pac.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Grotius,</HI> Laws of War as well as of Peace.

<HEAD> SECT. X. The words of St. <HI>Paul</HI> enjoining obedience to higher Powers, favor all sorts of Governments no less than Monarchy.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's next quarrel is with St. <HI>Paul, who did not,</HI> at he says, <HI>in enjoining subjection to the higher Powers, signify the Laws of the Land, or mean the highest Powers, as well Aristocratical and Democratical as Regal, but a Monarch that carries the Sword,</HI> &amp;c. But what if there be no Monarch in the place? or what if he do not carry the Sword? Had the Apostle spoken in vain, if the liberty of the <HI>Romans</HI> had not bin overthrown by the fraud and violence of <HI>Cesar?</HI> Was no obedience to be exacted whilst that people enjoy'd the benefit of their own Laws, and Vertue flourish'd under the moderate Government of a legal and just Magistracy, establish'd for the common good, by the common consent of all? Had God no Minister amongst them till Law and Justice was overthrown, the best part of the people destroy'd by the fury of a cor∣rupt mercenary Soldiery, and the world subdu'd under the Tyranny of the worst Monsters that it had ever produc'd? Are these the ways of establishing God's Vicegerents, and will he patronize no Governors or Governments but such as these? Dos God uphold evil, and that only? If the world has bin hitherto mistaken, in giving the name of evil to that which is good, and calling that good which is evil; I desire to know what can be call'd good amongst men, if the Government of the <HI>Romans,</HI> till they enter'd <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> and were corrupted by the Luxury of both, do not deserve that name? or what is to be esteem'd evil, if the establishment and exercise of the <HI>Cesars</HI> Power were not so? But says he, <HI>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power?</HI> And was there no Power in the Governments that had no Monarchs? Were the <HI>Carthaginians, Romans, Grecians, Gauls, Germans</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> without Power? Was there no Sword in that Nation and their Magistrats, who overthrew the King∣doms of <HI>Armenia, Egypt, Numidia, Macedon,</HI> with many others, and whom none of the Monarchs were able to resist? Are the <HI>Venetians, Switzers, Grisons</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> now le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in the same weakness, and no obedience at all due to their Magistrats? If this be so, how comes it to pass that Justice is so well administer'd amongst them? Who is it that defends the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in such a manner, that the greatest Monarchs with all their Swords have had no great reason to boast of any Advantages gain'd against them? at least till we (whom they could not resist when we had no Monarch, tho we have bin disgracefully beaten by them since we had one) by making Leagues against them, and sowing divisions amongst them, instigated and assisted the greatest Power now in the world to their destruction and our own. But our Author is so accustom'd to fraud, that he never cites a passage of Scripture which he dos not abuse or vitiate; and that he may do the same in this place, he leaves out the following words, <HI>For there is no power but of God,</HI> that he might intitle one sort only to his protection. If therefore the People and popu∣lar Magistrats of <HI>Athens;</HI> the two Kings, <HI>Ephori</HI> and Senat of <HI>Sparta;</HI> the <HI>Sanhedrins</HI> amongst the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> the Consuls, Tribuns, Pretors and
<PB N="267" REF="275"/>
Senat of <HI>Rome;</HI> the Magistrats of <HI>Holland, Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> have or had power, we may conclude that they also were ordain'd by God; and that according to the precept of the Apostle, the same obedience for the same reason is due to them as to any Monarch.</P>
<P>The Apostle farther explaining himself, and shewing who may be accounted a Magistrate, and what the duty of such a one is, informs us when we should fear, and on what account. <HI>Rulers,</HI> says he, <HI>are not a terror to good works, but to the evil: Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same; for he is the Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> He therefore is only the Minister of God, who is not a terror to good works, but to evil; who executes wrath upon those that do evil, and is a praise to those that do well. And he who dos well, ought not to be afraid of the power, for he shall receive praise. Now if our Au∣thor were alive, tho he was a man of a hard forehead, I would ask him, whether in his Conscience he believ'd, that <HI>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero,</HI> and the rabble of succeeding Monsters, were a praise to those who did well, and a terror to those who did ill; and not the contrary, a praise to the worst, and a terror to the best men of the world? or for what reason <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob virtutes certissimum exitium.</NOTE><HI>Tacitus</HI> could say, that Vertue brought men who liv'd under 'em to certain destruction, and recite so many Examples of the brave and good, who were murder'd by them for being so, unless they had endeavour'd to extinguish all that was good, and to <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ipsam exscindere virtutem.</NOTE>tear up Vertue by the roots? Why did he call <HI>Domitian</HI> an <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Virtutibus infestum.</NOTE>Enemy to Vertue, if he was a terror only to those that did evil? If the world has hitherto bin misled in these things, and given the name of Vertue to Vice, and of Vice to Vertue, then <HI>Germanicus, Valerius Asiaticus, Corbulo, Helvidius Priscus, Thraseas, Soranus</HI> and others that resembled them, who fell under the rage of those Beasts, nay <HI>Paul</HI> himself and his Disciples were evil doers; and <HI>Macro, Narcissus, Pallas, Vinnius, Laco</HI> and <HI>Tigellinus</HI> were vertuous and good men. If this be so, we are beholden to <HI>Filmer</HI> for admonishing mankind of the error in which they had so long continu'd. If not, those who persecuted and murder'd them for their Vertues, were not a terror to such as did evil, and a praise to those who did well. The worst men had no need to fear them; but the best had, because they were the best. All Princes therefore that have power are not to be esteem'd equally the Ministers of God. They that are so, must receive their dignity from a title that is not common to all, even from a just employment of their power to the incouragement of Vertue, and to the discouragement of Vice. He that pretends to the veneration and obedience due to the Ministers of God, must by his actions manifest that he is so. And tho I am unwilling to advance a proposition that may sound harshly to tender ears, I am inclin'd to believe, that the same rule, which obliges us to yield obedience to the good Magistrate who is the Minister of God, and assures us that in obeying him we obey God, dos equally oblige us not to obey those who make themselves the Ministers of the Devil, lest in obeying them, we obey the Devil, whose works they do.</P>
<P>That none but such as are wilfully ignorant may mistake <HI>Paul</HI>'s mean∣ing, <HI>Peter,</HI> who was directed by the same Spirit, says distinctly, <HI>Submit</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="276"/>
 <HI>your selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lord's sake.</HI> If therefore there be several Ordinances of men tending to the same end, that is, the obtaining of Justice, by being a terror to▪ the evil and a praise to the good, the like obedience is for conscience sake enjoin'd to all, and upon the same condition. But as no man dares to say, that <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Persia, Carthage</HI> and <HI>Egypt, Switzerland</HI> and <HI>France, Venice</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> were and are under the same Government; the same obedience is due to the Ma∣gistrate in every one of those places, and all others on the same account, whilst they continue to be the Ministers of God.</P>
<P>If our Author say, that <HI>Peter</HI> cannot comprehend Kings under the name of human Ordinances, since <HI>Paul</HI> says they are the Ordinance of God, I may as well say that <HI>Paul</HI> cannot call that the Ordinance of God, which <HI>Peter</HI> calls the ordinance of man. But as it was said of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> that they who spoke by the same Spirit could not contradict each other, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> being full of Wisdom and Sanctity, and inspir'd by the same Spirit, must needs say the same thing; and <HI>Grotius</HI> shews that they perfectly agree, tho the one calls Kings, Rulers and Governors, the Ordinance of Man, and the other the Ordinance of God; inasmuch as God having from the beginning ordain'd that men should not live like Wolves in woods, every man by himself, but together in Civil Societys, left to every one a liberty of joining with that Society which best pleas'd him, and to every Society to create such Magistrats, and frame such Laws as should seem most conducing to their own good, according to the measure of light and reason they might have. And every Magistracy so instituted might rightly be call'd the Ordinance of Man who was the Instituter, and the Ordinance of God according to which it was instituted; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quia salubrem hominum Constitutionem Deus probavit &amp; sauxie. <BIBL>De Jur. Bel. &amp; Pac.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>because,</HI> says he, <HI>God approv'd and ratify'd the salutary Constitutions of Government made by men.</HI></P>
<P>But, says our Author, <HI>Peter</HI> expounds his own words of the human Ordinance to be the King, who is the <HI>Lex loquens:</HI> but he says no such thing, and I do not find that any such thought ever enter'd into the Apostle's mind. The words are often found in the works of <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> but apply'd only to such a man as is a King by nature, who is endow'd with all the vertues that tend to the good of human Societys in a greater measure than any or all those that compose them; which Cha∣racter, I think, will be ill apply'd to all Kings. And that this may ap∣pear to be true, I desire to know whether it would well have agreed with <HI>Nero, Caligula, Domitian,</HI> or others like to them; and if not with them, then not with all, bot only with those who are endow'd with such Vertues. But if the King be made by man, he must be such as man makes him to be; and if the power of a Law had bin given by any hu∣man Sanction to the word of a foolish, mad or wicked man (which I hardly believe) it would be destroy'd by its own iniquity and turpitude, and the People left under the obligation of rendring obedience to those, who so use the Sword that the Nations under them may live soberly, peaceably and honestly.</P>
<P>This obliges me a little to examin what is meant by the Sword. The Pope says there are two Swords, the one temporal, the other spiritual; and that both of them were given to <HI>Peter</HI> and to his Successors. Others more rightly understand the two Swords to be that of War and that of
<PB N="269" REF="277"/>
Justice, which according to several Constitutions of Government have bin committed to several hands, under several conditions and limitations. The Sword of Justice comprehends the Legislative and the Executive Power: the one is exercis'd in making Laws, the other in judging Con∣troversys according to such as are made. The military Sword is us'd by those Magistrats who have it, in making War or Peace with whom they think fit; and sometimes by others who have it not, in pursuing such Wars as are resolv'd upon by another Power. The Jewish Doctors generally agree that the Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> could make no Law, because there was a curse denounc'd against those who should add to, or detract from that which God had given by the hand of <HI>Moses;</HI> that they might sit in Judgment with the High Priest and Sanhedrin, but could not judg by themselves, unless the Sanhedrin did plainly fail of performing their duty. Upon this account <HI>Maimonides</HI> excuses <HI>David</HI> for commanding <HI>Solomon</HI> not to suffer the grey hairs of <HI>Joab</HI> to go down to the grave in peace, and <HI>Solomon</HI> for appointing him to be kill'd at the foot of the Al∣tar: for he having kill'd <HI>Abner</HI> and <HI>Amasa,</HI> and by those actions shed the blood of war in time of peace, the Sanhedrin should have punish'd him; but being protected by favor or power, and even <HI>David</HI> himself fearing him, <HI>Solomon</HI> was put in mind of his duty, which he perform'd, tho <HI>Joab</HI> laid hold upon the horns of the Altar, which by the express words of the Law gave no protection to wilful Murderers.</P>
<P>The use of the military Sword amongst them was also moderated. Their Kings might make War upon the seven accursed Nations that they were commanded to destroy, and so might any other man; for no peace was to be made with them: but not against any other Nation, without the assent of the Sanhedrin. And when <HI>Amaziah</HI> contrary to that Law had foolishly made war upon <HI>Joash</HI> King of <HI>Israel,</HI> and there∣by brought a great slaughter upon <HI>Judah,</HI> the Princes, that is the Sanhedrin, combin'd against him, pursu'd him to <HI>Lachish,</HI> and kill'd him there.</P>
<P>The Legislative Power of <HI>Sparta</HI> was evidently in the People. The Laws that go under the name of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> were propos'd by him to the general Assembly of the People, and from them receiv'd their Authority: But the disciplin they contain'd was of such efficacy sor framing the minds of men to vertue, and by banishing Silver and Gold they so far banish'd all manner of Crimes, that from the institution of those Laws to the times of their Corruption, which was more than eight hundred years, we hardly find that three men were put to death, of whom two were Kings; so that it seems difficult to determin where the power of judging did reside, tho 'tis most probable, considering the nature of their Government, that it was in the Senat, and in Cases extraordinary in the <HI>Ephori,</HI> with a right of appealing to the People. Their Kings theresore conld have little to do with the Sword of Justice, neither the Legislative nor the Judicial Power being any ways in them.</P>
<P>The military Sword was not much more in their power, unless the excellency of their Vertues gave them the credit of persuading, when the Law deny'd the right of commanding. They were oblig'd to make war against those, and those only, who were declar'd Enemys by the Senat and <HI>Ephori,</HI> and in the manner, place and time they directed: so that <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> tho carrying on a glorious War in <HI>Persia,</HI> no sooner re∣ceiv'd the Parchment Roll, wherein he was commanded by the <HI>Ephori</HI> to come home for the desence of his own Country, than he immediately
<PB N="270" REF="278"/>
 return'd, and is on that account call'd by no less a man than <HI>Xenophon,</HI> a good and faithful King rendring obedience to the Laws of his Country.</P>
<P>By this it appears that there are Kings, who may be fear'd by those that do ill, and not by such as do well; for having no more power than what the Law gives, and being oblig'd to execute it as the Law directs, they cannot depart from the Precept of the Apostle. My own actions therefore, or the sense of my own guilt arising from them, is to be the measure of my fear of that Magistrate who is the Minister of God, and not his Power.</P>
<P>The like may be said of almost all the Nations of the world, that have had any thing of Civil Order amongst them. The supreme Magistrate, under what name soever he was known, whether King, Emperor, Asymnetes, Suffetes, Consul, Dictator, or Archon, has usually a part assign'd to him in the administration of Justice and making War; but that he may know it to be assign'd and not inherent, and so assign'd as to be employ'd for the publick good, not to his own profit or pleasure, it is circumscrib'd by such rules as he cannot safely transgress. This is above all seen in the German Nations, from whom we draw our Ori∣ginal and Government; and is so well describ'd by <HI>Tacitus</HI> in his treatise of their Customs and Manners, that I shall content my self to refer to it, and to what I have cited from him in the former part of this Work. The Saxons coming into our Country, retain'd to themselves the same rights. They had no Kings but such as were set up by themselves, and they abrogated their Power when they pleas'd. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ad Libertatis vestrae tuitionem non meis meritis, sed sola liberalitate vestra.</NOTE><HI>Offa</HI> acknowledg'd <HI>that he was chosen for the defence of their Liberty, not from his own merit, but by their favor;</HI> and in the <HI>Conventus Pananglicus,</HI> at which all the chief men as well Secular as Ecclesiastical were present, it was decreed by the King, Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Dukes and Senators, that the Kings should be chosen by the Priests, and by the Elders of the People.

If he possest no right except what was confer'd upon him, no more was confer'd than had bin enjoy'd by the antient Kings, according to the approv'd Laws which he swore to observe. Those Laws gave no power to any, till he was elected; and that which they did then give was so limited, that the Nobility and People reserv'd to themselves the disposition of the greatest Affairs, even to the deposition and expulsion of such as should not well perform the duty of their Oath and Office. And I leave it to our Author to prove, how they can be said to have had the Sword and the Power so as to be fear'd, otherwise than, as the Apostle says, by those that do evil; which we acknowledg to be not only in the King, but in the lowest Officer of Justice in the world.</P>
<P>If it be pretended that our later Kings are more to be fear'd than <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman,</HI> or his Predecessors, it must not be, as has bin prov'd, either from the general right of Kings, or from the Doctrin of the Apo∣stle, but from something else that is peculiar and subsequent, which I leave our Author's Disciples to prove, and an answer may be found in due time. But to show that our Ancestors did not mistake the words of the Apostle, 'tis good to consider when, to whom, and upon what occasion he spoke. The Christian Religion was then in its infancy: his discourses were addrest to the Professors of it, who tho they soon grew to be considerable in number, were for the most part of the meanest sort of People, Servants or Inhabitants of the Citys, rather than Citi∣zens and Freemen; join'd in no civil Body or Society, nor such as had or could have any part in the Government. The occasion was to suppress the dangerous mistake of many converted Jews and others, who know∣ing themselves to be freed from the power of Sin and the Devil, pre∣sum'd they were also freed from the obligation of human Laws. And if this Error had not bin crop'd in the bud, it would have given occa∣sion to their Enemys, (who desir'd nothing more) to destroy them all;
<PB N="272" REF="280"/>
 and who knowing that such Notions were stirring among them, would have bin glad, that they who were not easily to be discover'd, had by that means discover'd themselves.</P>
<P>This induc'd a necessity of diverting a poor, mean, scatter'd People from such thoughts concerning the State; to convince them of the Error into which they were fallen, that Christians did not owe the same obe∣dience to Civil Laws and Magistrats as other men; and to keep them from drawing destruction upon themselves by such ways, as not being war∣ranted by God, had no promise of his Protection. St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s work was to preserve the Professors of Christianity, as appears by his own words: <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2.</NOTE><HI>I exhort, that first of all, Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. Put</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 3.</NOTE><HI>them in mind to be subject to Principalitys and Powers, to obey Magistrats, to be ready for every good work.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> agrees with him fully in describing the Magistrate and his Duty; shewing the reasons why obedience should be paid to him, and teaching Christians to be humble and contented with their condition, as free, yet not using their Liberty for a cover to malice; and not only to fear God and honor the King (of which conjunction of words such as <HI>Filmer</HI> are very proud) but <HI>to honor all men,</HI> as is said in the same verse. This was in a peculiar manner the work of that time, in which those who were to preach and propagate the Gospel, were not to be diverted from that Duty, by entangling themselves in the care of State-affairs; but it dos in some sense agree with all times: for it can ne∣ver be the duty of a good man to oppose such a Magistrate as is the Mini∣ster of God, in the exercise of his Office, nor to deny to any man that which is his due.</P>
<P>But as the Christian Law exempts no man from the Duty he ows to his Father, Master, or the Magistrate, it dos not make him more a Slave than he was before, nor deprive him of any natural or civil Right; and if we are oblig'd to pay Tribute, Honor, or any other thing where it is not due, it must be by some Precept very different from that which com∣mands us to give to <HI>Cesar</HI> that which is <HI>Cesar</HI>'s. If he define the Magi∣strate to be the Minister of God doing Justice, and from thence draws the Reasons he gives for rendring Obedience to him, we are to inquire whose Minister he is who overthrows it, and look for some other reason for rendring obedience to him than the words of the Apostles. If <HI>David,</HI> who was willing to lay down his life for the people, who <HI>hated iniquity,</HI> and would not <HI>suffer a liar to come into his presence,</HI> was the Minister of God, I desire to know whose Minister <HI>Caligula</HI> was, who set up himself to be worship'd for a God, and would at once have destroy'd all the people that he ought to have protected? Whose Minister was <HI>Nero,</HI> who, be∣sides the abominable impuritys of his life, and hatred to all Vertue as con∣trary to his Person and Government, set fire to the great City? If it be true, that <HI>contrariorum contraria est ratio,</HI> these questions are easily decid∣ed; and if the reasons of things are eternal, the same distinction grounded upon truth will be good for ever. Every Magistrate and every man by his works will for ever declare whose Minister he is, in what spirit he lives, and consequently what obedience is due to him according to the Precept of the Apostle. If any man ask what I mean by Justice, I an∣swer, That the Law of the Land, as far as it is <HI>Sanctio rect a, jubens ho∣nesta, prohibens contraria,</HI> declares what it is. But there have bin and are Laws that are neither just nor commendable. There was a Law in <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="281"/>
that no God should be worship'd without the consent of the Senat: Up∣on which <HI>Tertullian</HI> says scoffingly, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nisi homini Deus placuerit, Deus non erit.</NOTE><HI>That God shall not be God, unless he please Man:</HI> and by virtue of this Law the first Christians were expos'd to all manner of crueltys; and some of the Emperors (in other respects excellent Men) most foully polluted themselves and their Government with innocent Blood. <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> was taken in this snare; and <HI>Ter∣tullian</HI> bitterly derides <HI>Trajan</HI> for glorying in his Clemency, when he had commanded <HI>Pliny,</HI> who was Proconsul in <HI>Asia,</HI> not to make any search for Christians, but only to punish them according to Law when they should be brought before him. No Municipal Law can be more firmly esta∣blish'd by human Authority, than that of the Inquisition in <HI>Spain,</HI> and other places: And those accursed Tribunals, which have shed more Chri∣stian blood than all the Pagans that ever were in the world, are commonly call'd <HI>The Holy Office.</HI> If a Gentleman in <HI>Poland</HI> kill a Peasant, he is by a Law now in use free from punishment, if he lay a Ducat upon the dead Body. <HI>Evenus</HI> the Third, King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> caus'd a Law to pass, by which the Wives and Daughters of Noblemen were expos'd to his Lust, and those of the Commons to the Lust of the Nobility. These, and an infinite number of others like to them, were not right Sanctions, but such as have produc'd unspeakable mischiefs and calamitys. They were not therefore Laws: the name of Justice is abusively attributed to them: Those that govern by them cannot be the Ministers of God: and the Apostle com∣manding our obedience to the Minister of God for our good, commands us not to be obedient to the Minister of the Devil to our hurt; for we cannot serve two Masters.</P>

<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XI. That which is not just, is not Law; and that which is not Law, ought not to be obey'd.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author having for a long time pretended Conscience, now pulls off his Mask, and plainly tells us, that 'tis not on account of Con∣science, but for fear of punishment or in hope of reward, that Laws are to be obey'd. <HI>That familiar distinction of the Schoolmen,</HI> says he, <HI>whereby they subject Kings to the directive, but not to the coactive Power of the Law, is a confession, that Kings are not bound by the positive Laws of any Nation, since the compulsory Power of Laws is that which properly makes Laws to be Laws.</HI> Not troubling my self with this distinction of the Schoolmen, nor acknow∣ledging any truth to be in it, or that they are competent Judges of such matters, I say, that if it be true, our Author's conclusion is altogether false; for the directive Power of the Law, which is certain, and grounded upon the inherent good and rectitude that is in it, is that alone which has a power over the Conscience, whereas the coercive is merely contingent; and the most just powers commanding the most just things, have so osten fallen under the violence of the most unjust men command∣ing the most execrable villanys, that if they were therefore to be obey'd, the Consciences of men must be regulated by the success of a Battel or Conspiracy, than which nothing can be affirm'd more impious and ab∣surd.
<PB N="274" REF="282"/>
 By this rule <HI>David</HI> was not to be obey'd, when by the wicked∣ness of his Son he was driven from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and depriv'd of all coer∣cive Power; and the conscientious obedience that had bin due to him was transfer'd to <HI>Absalom,</HI> who sought his life. And in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s time, it was not from him who was guided only by the Spirit of God, and had no manner of coercive Power, that Christians were to learn their duty, but from <HI>Caligula, Claudius,</HI> and <HI>Nero,</HI> who had that Power well esta∣blish'd by the mercenary Legions. If this were so, the Governments of the World might be justly call'd <HI>Magna Latrocinia;</HI> and men laying aside all considerations of Reason or Justice, ought only to follow those who can inflict the greatest Punishments, or give the greatest Rewards. But since the reception of such opinions would be the extirpation of all that can be call'd good, we must look for another rule of our obedience, and shall find that to be the Law, which being, as I said before, <HI>Sanctio recta,</HI> must be founded upon that eternal Principle of Reason and Truth, from whence the rule of Justice which is sacred and pure ought to be deduc'd, and not from the deprav'd will of man, which fluctuating according to the different Interests, Humors and Passions that at several times reign in several Nations, one day abrogates what had bin enacted the other. The Sanction therefore that deserves the name of a Law, <HI>which derives not its excellency from Antiquity, or from the dignity of the Legislators, but from an intrinsick equity and justice,</HI> ought to be made in pursuance of that uni∣versal Reason to which all Nations at all times owe an equal veneration and obedience. By this we may know whether he who has the Power dos justice or not: Whether he be the Minister of God to our good, a protector of good, and a terror to ill men; or the Minister of the Devil to our hurt, by encouraging all manner of evil, and endeavouring by vice and corruption to make the people worse that they may be miserable, and miserable that they may be worse. I dare not say I shall never fear such a man if he be arm'd with power: But I am sure I shall never esteem him to be the Minister of God, and shall think I do ill if I fear him. If he has therefore a coercive Power over me, 'tis thro my weakness; <HI>for</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qui cogi potest nescit mori.</NOTE><HI>he that will suffer himself to be compel'd, knows not how to die.</HI> If there∣fore he who dos not follow the directive Power of the Law, be not the Minister of God, he is not a King, at least not such a King as the Apostle commands us to obey: And if that Sanction which is not just be not a Law, and can have no obligation upon us, by what Power soever it be establish'd, it may well fall out, that the Magistrate who will not follow the directive Power of the Law, may fall under the coercive; and then the fear is turn'd upon him, with this aggravation, that it is not only actual, but just. This was the case of <HI>Nero;</HI> the coercive Power was no longer in him, but against him. He that was forc'd to fly and to hide himself, that was abandon'd by all men, and condemn'd to die <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">More Majorum. <BIBL>Sueton.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>accord∣ing to antient Custom,</HI> did, as I suppose, fear, and was no way to be fear'd. The like may be said of <HI>Amaziah</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> when he fled to <HI>Lachish;</HI> of <HI>Nabuchodonozor,</HI> when he was driven from the society of men; and of many Emperors and Kings of the greatest Nations in the world, who have bin so utterly depriv'd of all Power, that they have bin imprison'd, depos'd, confin'd to Monasterys, kill'd, drawn thro the Streets, cut in pieces, thrown into Rivers, and indeed suffer'd all that could be suffer'd by the vilest Slaves.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="283"/>
If any man say these things ought not to have bin done, an answer may be given in a proper place; tho 'twere enough to say, that the Justice of the world is not to be overthrown by a mere Assertion without proof: but that is nothing to the present Question. For if it was ill done to drive <HI>Nero</HI> to despair, or to throw <HI>Vitellius</HI> into the common Shore, it was not because they were the Ministers of God; for their Lives were no way conformable to the character which the Apostle gives of those who de∣serve that Sacred Name. If those only are to be fear'd who have the Power, there was a time when they were not to be fear'd, for they had none; and if such Princes are not oblig'd by the Law as are not under the coercive Power, it gave no exemption to those, for they fell under it: and as we know not what will befal others who walk in their steps till they are dead, we cannot till then know whether they are free from it or not.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XII. The Right and Power of a Magistrate depends upon his Insti∣tution, not upon his Name.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS usual with Impostors to obtrude their deceits upon men, by putting false names upon things, by which they may perplex mens minds, and from thence deduce false Conclusions. But the points above▪mention'd being settled, it imports little whether the Governors to whom <HI>Peter</HI> enjoins obedience, were only Kings, and such as are employ'd by them, or all such Magistrats as are the Ministers of God; for he informs us of their Works that we may know them, and accordingly yield obe∣dience to them. This is that therefore which distinguishes the Magi∣strate to whom obedience is due, from him to whom none is due, and not the name that he either assumes, or others put upon him. But if there be any virtue in the word King, and that the admirable Prerogatives, of which our Author dreams, were annex'd to that Name, they could not be apply'd to the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, nor their substituted Officers, for they had it not. 'Tis true, <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> in a drunken fit, at the celebra∣tion of the impure <HI>Lupercalia,</HI> did offer a Diadem to <HI>Julius Cesar,</HI> which some flatterers prest him to accept, (as our great Lawyers did <HI>Cromwel)</HI> but he durst not think of putting it upon his Head. <HI>Caligula</HI>'s affecta∣tion of that title, and the ensigns of Royalty he wore, were taken for the most evident marks of his madness: and tho the greatest and bravest of their men had fallen by the Wars or Proscriptions; tho the best part of the Senat had perish'd in <HI>Thessaly;</HI> tho the great City was exhausted, and <HI>Italy</HI> brought to desolation, yet they were not reduc'd so low as to endure a King. <HI>Piso</HI> was sufficiently addicted to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> yet he could not suf∣fer that <HI>Germanicus</HI> should be treated as the Son of a King; <HI>Prin∣cipis Romani non Parthorum regis silio has epulas dari.</HI> And whoever un∣derstands the Latin Tongue, and the History of those times, will easily perceive that the word <HI>Princeps</HI> signify'd no more than a principal or emi∣nent man, as has bin already prov'd: and the words of <HI>Piso</HI> could have no other meaning, than that the Son of a <HI>Roman</HI> ought not to be distin∣guish'd from others, as the Sons of the <HI>Parthian</HI> Kings were. This is verify'd by his Letter to <HI>Tiberius</HI> under the name of Friend, and the
<PB N="276" REF="284"/>
 answer of <HI>Tiberius</HI> promising to him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quod amicus amico praestare potest. <BIBL>Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>whatsoever one friend could do for another.</HI> Here was no mention of Majesty or Sovereign Lord, nor the base subscriptions of Servant, Subject, or Creature. And I fear, that as the last of those words was introduc'd amongst us by our Bishops, the rest of them had bin also invented by such Christians as were too much addicted to the Asiatick Slavery. However, the name of King was never solemnly assum'd by, nor confer'd upon those Emperors, and could have confer'd no right, if it had. They exercis'd as they pleas'd, or as they durst, the power that had bin gain'd by violence or fraud. The exorbitances they committed, could not have bin justify'd by a Title, any more than those of a Pyrat who should take the same. It was no other∣wise given to 'em than by way of assimilation, when they were guilty of the greatest Crimes: and <HI>Tacitus</HI> describing the detestable Lust of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Annal. l. 6.</NOTE><HI>Tiberius,</HI> says, <HI>Quibus adeo indomitis exarserat, ut more Regio pubem in∣genuam stupris pollueret; nec formam tantum &amp; decora corporis, sed in his modestam pueritiam, in aliis majorum imagines, incitamentum cupiditatis habebat.</HI> He also informs us that <HI>Nero</HI> took his time to put <HI>Bareas So∣ranus</HI> to death, who was one of the most vertuous men of that age, when <HI>Tiridates</HI> King of <HI>Armenia</HI> was at <HI>Rome;</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ut magnitudinem Imperatoriam caede insignium virorum quasi Regio facinore ostentaret. <BIBL>An. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>16.</HI></BIBL></NOTE><HI>That he might shew the Im∣perial Grandeur by the slaughter of the most illustrious men, which he ac∣counted a Royal Action.</HI> I leave it to the judgment of all wise men, whe∣ther it be probable that the Apostles should distinguish such as these from other Magistrats; and dignify those only with the Title of God's Mi∣nisters, who distinguish'd themselves by such ways; or that the suc∣ceeding Emperors should be ennobled with the same Prerogative, who had no other Title to the name than by resembling those that had it in such things as these. If this be too absurd and abominable to enter into the heart of a man, it must be concluded, that their intention was only to divert the poor People to whom they preach'd, from involving themselves in the care of Civil matters, to which they had no call. And the Counsel would have bin good (as things stood with them) if they had bin under the power of a Pyrat, or any other villain substi∣tuted by him.</P>
<P>But tho the Apostles had look'd upon the Officers set over the Pro∣vinces belonging to the Roman Empire, as sent by Kings, I desire to know whether it can be imagin'd, that they could think the subordinate Governors to be sent by Kings, in the Countrys that had no Kings; or that obedience became due to the Magistrats in <HI>Greece, Italy,</HI> or other Provinces under the jurisdiction of <HI>Rome,</HI> only after they had Emperors, and that none was due to them before? The <HI>Germans</HI> had then no King: The brave <HI>Arminius</HI> had bin lately kill'd for aiming at a Crown. When he had blemish'd all his Vertues by that attempt, they forgot his former Services. They never consider'd how many Roman Legions he had cut in pieces, nor how many thousands of their Allies he had destroy'd. His Valor was a crime deserving death, when he sought to make a Prey of his Country, which he had so bravely defended, and to enslave those who with him had fought for the publick Liberty. But if the Apostles were to be understood to give the name of God's Ministers only to Kings, and those who are employ'd by them, and that obedience is due
<PB N="277" REF="285"/>
to no other, a domestick Tyrant had bin their greatest Benefactor. He had set up the only Government that is authoriz'd by God, and to which a conscientious obedience is due. <HI>Agathocles, Dionysius, Phalaris, Phaereus, Pisistratus, Nabis, Machanidas,</HI> and an infinite number of the most detestable Villains that the world has ever produc'd, did confer the same benefits upon the Countrys they enslav'd. But if this be equally false, sottish, absurd, and execrable, all those Epithets belong to our Author and his Doctrin, for attempting to depress all modest and regular Magistracys, and endeavouring to corrupt the Scripture to patronize the greatest of Crimes. No man therefore who dos not delight in error, can think that the Apostle design'd precisely to determin such questions as might arise concerning any one man's right, or in the least degree to pre∣fer any one form of Government before another. In acknowledging the Magistrate to be Man's Ordinance, he declares that Man who makes him to be, may make him to be what he pleases; and tho there is found more prudence and vertue in one Nation than in another, that Magistra∣cy which is establish'd in any one ought to be obey'd, till they who made the establishment think fit to alter it. All therefore whilst they continue, are to be look'd upon with the same respect. Every Nation acting freely, has an equal right to frame their own Government, and to employ such Officers as they please. The Authority, Right and Power of these must be regulated by the judgment, right and power of those who appoint them, without any relation at all to the name that is given; for that is no way essential to the thing. The same name is frequently given to those, who differ exceedingly in right and power; and the same right and power is as often annex'd to Magistracys that differ in name. The same power which had bin in the Roman Kings, was given to the Con∣suls; and that which had bin legally in the Dictators for a time not ex∣ceeding six months, was afterwards usurp'd by the <HI>Cesars,</HI> and made perpetual. The supreme Power (which some pretend belongs to all Kings) has bin and is enjoy'd in the fullest extent by such as never had the name; and no Magistracy was ever more restrain'd than those that had the name of Kings in <HI>Sparta, Arragon, England, Poland,</HI> and other places. They therefore that did thus institute, regulate and restrain, create Magistracys, and give them names and powers as seem'd best to them, could not but have in themselves the coercive as well as the di∣rective over them: for the regulation and restriction is coercion; but most of all the institution, by which they could make them to be or not to be. As to the exterior sorce, 'tis sometimes on the side of the Ma∣gistrate, and sometimes on that of the People; and as Magistrats under several names have the same work incumbent upon 'em, and the same Power to persorm it, the same Duty is to be exacted from them, and render'd to them: which being distinctly proportion'd by the Laws of every Country, I may conclude, that all Magistratical Power being the Ordinance of Man in pursuance of the Ordinance of God, receives its being and measure from the Legislative Power of every Nation. And whether the power be plac'd simply in one, a few, or many men; or in one body compos'd of the three simple Species; whether the single Per∣son be call'd King, Duke, Marquess, Emperor, Sultan, Mogol, or Grand Signor; or the number go under the name of Senat, Council, Pregadi, Diet, Assembly of Estates and the like, 'tis the same thing. The same obedience is equally due to all, whilst according to the Precept of the Apostle, they do the work of God for our good: and if they
<PB N="278" REF="286"/>
 depart from it, no one of them has a better Title than the other to our obedience.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. Laws were made to direct and instruct Magistrats, and, if they will not be directed, to restrain them.</HEAD>
<P>I Know not who they are that our Author introduces to say, that <HI>the first invention of Laws was to bridle or moderate the overgreat Power of Kings;</HI> and unless they give some better proof of their judg∣ment in other things, shall little esteem them. They should have con∣sider'd, that there are Laws in many places where there are no Kings; that there were Laws in many before there were Kings, as in <HI>Israel</HI> the Law was given three hundred years before they had any; but most especially, that as no man can be a rightful King except by Law, nor have any just Power but from the Law, if that Power be found to be overgreat, the Law that gave it must have bin before that which was to moderate or restrain it; for that could not be moderated which was not in being. Leaving therefore our Author to fight with these Adversarys if he please when he finds them, I shall proceed to examin his own Po∣sitions. <HI>The truth is,</HI> says he, <HI>the Original of Laws was for the keeping of the Multitude in order. Popular Estates could not subsist at all without Laws, whereas Kingdoms were govern'd many Ages without them. The Peo∣ple of</HI> Athens, <HI>as soon as they gave over Kings, were forc'd to give power to</HI> Draco <HI>first, then to</HI> Solon, <HI>to make them Laws.</HI> If we will believe him therefore, wheresoever there is a King, or a man who by having power in his hands is in the place of a King, there is no need of Law. He takes them all to be so wise, just, and good, that they are Laws to them∣selves, <HI>Leges viventes.</HI> This was certainly verify'd by the whole suc∣cession of the <HI>Cesars,</HI> the ten last Kings of <HI>Pharamond</HI>'s Race, all the Successors of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, and others that I am not willing to name; but referring my self to History, I desire all reasonable men to consider, whether the piety and tender care that was natural to <HI>Caligula, Nero</HI> or <HI>Domitian,</HI> was such a security to the Nations that liv'd under them, as without Law to be sufficient for their preservation: for if the contrary appear to be true, and that their Government was a perpetual exercise of rage, malice and madness, by which the worst of men were arm'd with power to destroy the best, so that the Empire could only be sav'd by their destruction, 'tis most certain, that mankind can never fall into a condition which stands more in need of Laws to protect the innocent, than when such Monsters reign who endeavour their extirpation, and are too well furnish'd with means to accomplish their detestable designs. Without any prejudice therefore to the Cause that I defend, I might con∣fess that all Nations were at the first govern'd by Kings, and that no Laws were impos'd upon those Kings, till they or the Successors of those who had bin advanc'd for their vertues, by falling into vice and cor∣ruption, did manifestly discover the inconveniences of depending upon their will. Besides these, there are also children, women and fools, that often come to the succession of Kingdoms, whose weakness and igno∣rance stands in as great need of support and direction, as the desperate
<PB N="279" REF="287"/>
fury of the others can do of restriction. And if some Nations had bin so sottish, not to foresee the mischief of leaving them to their will, o∣thers, or the same in succeeding Ages discovering them, could no more be oblig'd to continue in so pernicious a folly, than we are to live in that wretched Barbarity in which the <HI>Romans</HI> found our Ancestors, when they first enter'd this Island.</P>
<P>If any man say, that <HI>Filmer</HI> dos not speak of Monsters, nor of Chil∣dren, Women or Fools, but of wise, just and good Princes: I answer, that if there be a right inherent in Kings, as Kings, of doing what they please; and in those who are next in blood, to succeed them and inherit the same, it must belong to all Kings, and such as upon title of blood would be Kings. And as there is no family that may not, and dos not often produce such as I mention'd, it must also be acknowledg'd in them: and that power which is left to the wise, just and good, upon a supposi∣tion that they will not make an ill use of it, must be devolv'd to those who will not or cannot make a good one; but will either maliciously turn it to the destruction of those they ought to protect, or thro weakness suf∣fer it to fall into the hands of those that govern them, who are found by experience to be for the most part the worst of all, most apt to use the basest arts, and to flatter the humors, and foment the vices that are most prevalent in weak and vicious Princes. <HI>Germanicus, Corbulo, Valerius Asiaticus, Thraseas, Soranus, Helvidius Priscus, Julius Agricola,</HI> and other excellent men liv'd in the times of <HI>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius</HI> and <HI>Nero;</HI> but the power was put into the hands of <HI>Sejanus, Macro, Tigellinus,</HI> and other Villains like to them: and I wish there were not too many modern examples to shew that weak and vicious Princes will never chuse such as shall preserve Nations from the mischiefs that would ensue upon their own incapacity or malice; but that they must be impos'd upon them by some other power, or Nations be ruin'd for want of them. This impo∣sition must be by Law or by Force. But as Laws are made to keep things in good order without the necessity of having recourse to force, it would be a dangerous extravagance to arm that Prince with force, which pro∣bably in a short time must be oppos'd by force; and those who have bin guilty of this error, as the Kingdoms of the East, and the antient <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, where no provision was made by Law against ill-governing Princes, have found no other remedy than to kill them, when by extreme sufferings they were driven beyond patience: and this fell out so often, that few of their Princes were observ'd to die by a common death. But since the Empire was transmitted to <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Emperors restrain'd by I aws, that Nation has never bin brought to the odious extremitys of suffering all manner of Indignitys, or revenging them upon the heads of Princes. And if the Pope had not disturb'd 'em upon the account of Re∣ligion, nor driven their Princes to disturb others, they might have pass'd many ages without any civil Dissension, and all their Emperors might have liv'd happily, and dy'd peaceably, as most of them have done.</P>
<P>This might be sufficient to my purpose: for if all Princes without distinc∣tion, whether good or bad, wise or foolish, young or old, sober or mad, cannot be intrusted with an unlimited power; and if the power they have, ought to be limited by Law, that Nations may not, with danger to them∣selves, as well as to the Prince, have recourse to the last remedy, this Law must be given to all, and the good can be no otherwise distinguish'd from the bad, and the wise from the foolish, than by the observation or viola∣tion of it. But I may justly go a step farther, and affirm, that this Law
<PB N="280" REF="288"/>
 which by restraining the Lusts of the vicious and foolish, frequently pre∣serves them from the destruction they would bring upon themselves or people, and sometimes upon both, is an assistance and direction to the wisest and best; so that they also as well as the Nations under them are gainers by it. This will appear strange only to those who know not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quam grave &amp; intolerandum sit cuncta regendi onus. <BIBL>Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>how difficult and insupportable the Government of great Nations is,</HI> and how un∣able the best man is to bear it. And if it surpass the strength of the best, it may easily be determin'd how ordinary men will behave themselves under it, or what use the worst will make of it. I know there have bin wise and good Kings; but they had not an absolute Power, nor would have accepted it, tho it had bin offer'd: much less can I believe that any of them would have transmitted such a power to their posterity, when none of them could know any more than <HI>Solomon,</HI> whether his Son would be a wise man or a fool. But if the best might have desir'd, and had bin able to bear it (tho <HI>Moses</HI> by his own confession was not) that could be no reason why it should be given to the worst and weakest, or those who probably will be so: Since the assurance that it will not be a∣bus'd during the life of one man, is nothing to the constitution of a State which aims at perpetuity: And no man knowing what men will be, espe∣cially if they come to the power by succession, which may properly e∣nough be call'd by chance, 'tis reasonably to be fear'd they will be bad, and consequently necessary so to limit their power, that if they prove to be so, the Commonwealth may not be destroy'd, which they were insti∣tuted to preserve. The Law provides for this in leaving to the King a full and ample power of doing as much good as his heart can wish, and in restraining his power so, that if he should depart from the duty of his Office, the Nation may not perish. This is a help to those who are wise and good, by directing them what they are to do, more certainly than any one man's personal judgment can do; and no prejudice at all, since no such man did ever complain he was not suffer'd to do the evil which he would abhor if it were in his power; and is a most necessary curb to the fury of bad Princes, preventing them from bringing destruction upon the people. Men are so subject to vices and passions, that they stand in need of some restraint in every condition; but most especially when they are in power. The rage of a private man may be pernicious to one or a few of his Neighbours; but the fury of an unlimited Prince would drive whole Nations into ruin: And those very men who have liv'd mo∣destly when they had little power, have often prov'd the most savage of all Monsters, when they thought nothing able to resist their rage. 'Tis said of <HI>Caligula,</HI> that no man ever knew <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nec meliorem servum, nec deteriorem dominum.</NOTE><HI>a better Servant, nor a worse Master.</HI> The want of restraint made him a Beast, who might have con∣tinu'd to be a Man. And tho I cannot say, that our Law necessarily ad∣mits the next in Blood to the Succession (for the contrary is prov'd) yet the facility of our Ancestors, in receiving children, women, or such men as were not more able than themselves to bear the weight of a Crown, convinces me fully, that they had so fram'd our Laws, that even chil∣dren, women, or ill men, might either perform as much as was necessari∣ly requir'd of 'em, or be brought to reason if they transgrest, and arro∣gated to themselves more than was allow'd. For 'tis not to be imagin'd,
<PB N="281" REF="289"/>
that a company of men should so far degenerate from their own Nature, which is Reason, to give up themselves and their Posterity, with all their concernments in the world, to depend upon the will of a child, a woman, an ill man, or a fool.</P>
<P>If therefore Laws are necessary to popular States, they are no less to Monarchys; or rather, that is not a State or Government which has them not: and 'tis no less impossible for any to subsist without 'em, than for the body of a man to be, and perform its functions without Nerves or Bones. And if any People had ever bin so foolish to establish that which they call'd a Government, without Laws to support and regulate it, the impossibility of subsisting would evidence the madness of the Constitution, and ought to deter all others from following their example.</P>
<P>'Tis no less incredible, that those Nations which rejected Kings, did put themselves into the Power of one man, to prescribe to 'em such Laws as he pleas'd. But the instances alledg'd by our Author are evidently false. The <HI>Athenians</HI> were not without Laws when they had Kings: <HI>Aegeus</HI> was subject to the Laws, and did nothing of importance without the consent of the People; and <HI>Theseus</HI> not being able to please them, dy'd a banish'd man: <HI>Draco</HI> and <HI>Solon</HI> did not make, but propose Laws, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. vit. Solon.</NOTE>they were of no force till establish'd by the Authority of the People. The <HI>Spartans</HI> dealt in the same manner with <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> he invented their Laws, but the People made them: and when the Assembly of all the Citizens had approv'd and sworn to observe them till his return from <HI>Crete,</HI> he resolv'd rather to die in a voluntary banishment, than by his re∣turn to absolve them from the Oath they had taken. The <HI>Romans</HI> also had Laws during the Government of their Kings; but not finding in 'em that Perfection they desir'd, the <HI>Decemviri</HI> were chosen to frame others, which yet were of no value till they were pass'd by the People in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ingenti hominum consensu propositis decem Tabulis Populum ad concionem convocarunt, &amp; quod bonum, faustum foelix{que} sit Reipublicae, ipsis, liberis{que} eorum esset, ire, &amp; legere propositas jussere. <BIBL>T.

But this Sanction, to which every man, whether Magistrate or private Citi∣zen, was subject, did no way bind the whole body of the People, who still retain'd in themselves the Power of changing both the matter and the form of their Government, as appears by their instituting and abrogat∣ing Kings, Consuls, Dictators, Tribuns with consular Power, and <HI>De∣cemviri,</HI> when they thought good for the Commonwealth.

<HEAD> SECT. XIV. Laws are not made by Kings, not because they are busy'd in greater matters than doing Justice, but because Nations will be govern'd by Rule, and not Arbitrarily.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author, pursuing the mistakes to which he seems perpetually condemn'd, says, that <HI>when Kings were either busy'd in War, or dis∣tracted with publick Cares, so that every private man could not have access unto their Persons, to learn their Wills and Pleasures, then of necessity were Laws invented, that so every particular Subject might find his Prince's Plea∣sure.</HI> I have often heard that Governments were establish'd for the ob∣taining of Justice; and if that be true, 'tis hard to imagin what business a supreme Magistrate can have to divert him from accomplishing the prin∣cipal end of his Institution. And 'tis as commonly said, that this distri∣bution of Justice to a People, is a work surpassing the strength of any one <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 18.</NOTE>man. <HI>Jethro</HI> seems to have bin a wise man, and 'tis probable he thought <HI>Moses</HI> to be so also; but he found the work of judging the People to be too heavy for him, and therefore advis'd him to leave the judgment of Causes to others who should be chosen for that purpose; which advice <HI>Moses</HI> accepted, and God approv'd. The governing power was as insup∣portable to him as the Judicial. He desir'd rather to dy than to bear so great a burden; and God neither accusing him of sloth or impatience, gave him seventy Assistants. But if we may believe our Author, the Powers Judicial and Legislative, that of judging as well as that of go∣verning, is not too much for any man, woman, or child whatsoever: and that he stands in no need, either of God's Statutes to direct him, or Man's Counsel to assist him, unless it be when he is otherwise employ'd; and his Will alone is sufficient for all. But what if he be not busy'd in greater matters, or distracted with publick cares; is every Prince capable of this work? Tho <HI>Moses</HI> had not found it too great for him; or it should be granted that a man of excellent natural Endowments, great Wisdom, Learning, Experience, Industry, and Integrity might perform it, is it certain that all those who happen to be born in reigning Familys are so? If <HI>Moses</HI> had the Law of God before his eyes, and could repair to God himself for the application or explanation of it; have all Princes the same Assistance? Do they all speak with God face to face, or can they do what he did, without the Assistance he had? If all Kings of mature years are of that perfection, are we assur'd that none shall dy before his Heir arrive to the same? Or shall he have the same ripeness of Judgment in his Infan∣cy? If a Child come to a Crown, dos that immediately infuse the most admirable Endowments and Graces? Have we any promise from Hea∣ven, that Women shall enjoy the same Prerogatives in those Countrys where they are made capable of the Succession? Or dos that Law which renders them capable, not only defend them against the frailty of their own Nature, but confer the most sublime vertues upon them? But who knows not, that no Familys do more frequently produce weak or ill men, than the greatest? and that which is worse, their greatness is a snare to
<PB N="283" REF="291"/>
them; so that they, who in a low condition might have pass'd unregard∣ed, being advanc'd to the highest, have often appear'd to be, or became the worst of all Beasts; and they who advance them are like to them: For if the Power be in the Multitude, as our Author is forc'd to confess (otherwise the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> could not have given all as he says, nor a part as I say, to <HI>Draco, Solon,</HI> or the <HI>Decemviri)</HI> they must be Beasts also, who should have given away their Right and Liberty, in hopes of receiving Justice from such as probably will neither understand nor regard it, or protection from those who will not be able to help themselves, and expect such Vertue, Wisdom, and Integrity should be, and for ever remain in the Family they set up, as was never known to continue in any. If the Power be not confer'd upon them, they have it not; and if they have it not, their want of leisure to do Justice, cannot have bin the cause for which Laws are made; and they cannot be the signification of their Will, but are that to which the Prince ows obedience, as well as the meanest Subject. This is that which <HI>Bracton</HI> calls <HI>esse sub lege,</HI> and says, that <HI>Rex in regno superiores habet Deum &amp; Legem. Fortescue</HI> says, The Kings of <HI>England</HI> cannot change the Laws: and indeed, they are so far from having any such Power, that the Judges swear to have no regard to the King's Letters or Commands, but if they receive any, to proceed according to Law, as if they had not bin. And the breach of this Oath dos not only bring a blemish upon their Reputation, but exposes them to capital Punishments, as many of them have found. 'Tis not therefore the King that makes the Law, but the Law that makes the King. It gives the rule for Succession, making Kingdoms sometimes Heredi∣tary, and sometimes Elective, and (more often than either simply) He∣reditary under condition. In some places Males only are capable of in∣heriting, in others Females are admitted. Where the Monarchy is regular, as in <HI>Germany, England,</HI> &amp;c. the Kings can neither make nor change Laws: They are under the Law, and the Law is not under them; their Letters or Commands are not to be regarded: In the ad∣ministration of Justice, the question is not what pleases them, but what the Law declares to be right, which must have its course, whether the King be busy or at leisure, whether he will or not. The King who ne∣ver dys, is always present in the supreme Courts, and neither knows nor regards the pleasure of the man that wears the Crown. But lest by his Riches and Power he might have some influence upon judicial Pro∣ceedings, the <HI>great Charter</HI> that recapitulates and acknowledges our an∣tient inherent Libertys, obliges him to swear, that he will neither sell, delay, nor deny Justice to any man, according to the Laws of the Land: which were ridiculous and absurd, if those Laws were only the signifi∣cation of his Pleasure, or any way depended upon his Will. This Char∣ter having bin confirm'd by more than thirty Parliaments, all succeeding Kings are under the obligation of the same Oath, or must renounce the benefit they receive from our Laws, which if they do, they will be sound to be equal to every one of us.</P>
<P>Our Author, according to his custom, having laid down a false pro∣position, gos about to justify it by misapplying the examples of <HI>Draco, Solon,</HI> the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> and <HI>Moses,</HI> of whom no one had the Power he attributes to them, and it were nothing to us if they had. The <HI>Atheni∣ans</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> as was said before, were so far from resigning the ab∣solute Power without appeal to themselves, that nothing done by their Magistrats was os any force, till it was enacted by the People. And the
<PB N="284" REF="292"/>
 power given to the <HI>Decemviri, sine provocatione,</HI> was only in private cases, there being no superior Magistrate then in being, to whom Ap∣peals could be made. They were vested with the same Power the Kings and Dictators enjoy'd, from whom there lay no Appeal, but to the People, and always to them; as appears by the case of <HI>Horatius</HI> in the time of <HI>Tullus Hostilius,</HI> that of <HI>Marcus Fabius</HI> when <HI>Papyrius Cursor</HI> was Dictator, and of <HI>Nenius</HI> the Tribun when <HI>Q. Fabius Maximus</HI> was in the same Office; all which I have cited already, and refer to them. There was therefore a reservation of the supreme Power in the People, notwithstanding the creation of Magistrats without Appeal; and as it was quietly exercis'd in making Strangers, or whom they pleas'd Kings, restraining the power of Dictators to six months, and that of the <HI>Decem∣viri</HI> to two years; when the last did, contrary to Law, endeavour by force to continue their Power, the People did by force destroy it and them.</P>
<P>The case of <HI>Moses</HI> is yet more clear: he was the most humble and gentle of all men: he never rais'd his heart above his brethren, and com∣manded Kings to live in the same modesty: he never desir'd the People should depend upon his will: In giving Laws to them he fulfill'd the will of God, not his own; and those Laws were not the signification of his will, but of the will of God. They were the production of God's Wisdom and Goodness, not the invention of Man; given to purify the People, not to advance the glory of their Leader. He was not proud and insolent, nor pleas'd with that ostentation of Pomp, to which Fools give the name of Majesty: and whoever so far exalts the power of a man, to make Nations depend upon his pleasure, dos not only lay a bur∣den upon him, which neither <HI>Moses</HI> nor any other could ever bear, and every wise man will always abhor; but with an impious fury, endea∣vours to set up a Government contrary to the Laws of God, presumes to accuse him of want of wisdom, or goodness to his own People, and to correct his Errors, which is a work fit to be undertaken by such as our Author.</P>
<P>From hence, as upon a solid foundation, he proceeds, and making use of King <HI>James</HI>'s words, infers, that Kings are above the Laws, because he so teaches us. But he might have remember'd, that having affirm'd the People could not judg of the disputes that might happen between them and Kings, because they must not be judges in their own case, 'tis absurd to make a King judg of a case so nearly concerning himself, in the decision of which his own Passions and Interests may probably lead him into errors. And if it be pretended that I do the same, in giving the judgment of those matters to the People, the case is utterly different, both in the nature and consequences. The King's judgment is merely for himself; and if that were to take place, all the Passions and Vices that have most power upon men, would concur to corrupt it. He that is set up for the publick good, can have no contest with the whole People whose good he is to procure, unless he deflect from the end of his Insti∣tution, and set up an Interest of his own in opposition to it. This is in its nature the highest os all delinquencys; and if such a one may be judg of his own crimes, he is not only sure to avoid punishment, but to obtain all that he sought by them; and the worse he is, the more violent will his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sires be, to get all the power into his hands, that he may grati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y his lusts, and execute his pernicious designs. On the other side, in a popular Assembly, no man judges for himself, otherwise than as his good
<PB N="285" REF="293"/>
is comprehended in that of the publick: Nothing hurts him, but what is prejudicial to the Commonwealth: Such amongst them as may have receiv'd private injurys, are so far only consider'd by others, as their sufferings may have influence upon the publick; if they be few, and the matters not great, others will not suffer their quiet to be disturb'd by them; if they are many and grievous, the Tyranny thereby appears to be so cruel, that the Nation cannot subsist, unless it be corrected or supprest. Corruption of Judgment proceeds from private Passions, which in these cases never govern: and tho a zeal for the publick good may possibly be misguided, yet till it be so, it can never be capable of excess. The last <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and his leud Son, exercis'd their Fury and Lust in the murders of the best men in <HI>Rome,</HI> and the rape of <HI>Lucretia. Appius Claudius</HI> was fill'd with the like madness. <HI>Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero</HI> were so well establish'd in the power of committing the worst of Vil∣lanys, that we do not hear of any man that offer'd to defend himself, or woman that presum'd to refuse them. If they had bin judges in these cases, the utmost of all Villanys and Mischiefs had bin establish'd by Law: but as long as the judgment of these matters was in the People, no private or corrupt Passion could take place. <HI>Lucius Brutus, Valerius, Horatius</HI> and <HI>Virginius,</HI> with the People that follow'd them, did not by the expulsion of the Kings, or the suppression of the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> assume to themselves a power of committing Rapes and Murders, nor any ad∣vantages beyond what their equals might think they deserv'd by their vertues, and services to the Commonwealth; nor had they more credit than others for any other reason, than that they shew'd themselves most forward in procuring the publick Good, and by their Valor and Conduct best able to promote it.</P>
<P>Whatsoever happen'd after the overthrow of their Liberty, belongs not to my Subject, for there was nothing of popularity in the judgments that were made. One Tyrant destroy'd another; the same Passions and Vices for the most part reign'd in both: The last was often as bad as his Predecessor whom he had overthrown; and one was sometimes approv'd by the People for no other reason, than that it was thought impossible for him to be worse than he who was in possession of the Power. But if one instance can be of force amongst an infinite number of various Accidents, the words of <HI>Valerius Asiaticus,</HI> who, by wishing he had bin the man that had kill'd <HI>Caligula,</HI> did in a moment pacify the fury of the Soldiers who were looking for those that had done it, shew, that as long as men retain any thing of that Reason which is truly their Nature, they never fail of judging rightly of Vertue and Vice; whereas violent and ill Princes have always done the contrary, and even the best do often deflect from the rules of Justice, as appears not only by the examples of <HI>Edward</HI> the first and third, who were brought to confess it, but even those of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, to shew that the decision of these Controversys cannot belong to any King, but to the People, we are only to consider, that as Kings and all other Magistrats, whether supreme or subordinate, are constituted only for the good of the People, the People only can be fit to judg whether the end be accomplish'd. A Physician dos not exercise his Art for himself, but for his Patients; and when I am, or think I shall be sick, I send for him of whom I have the best opinion, that he may help me to recover or preserve my health; but I lay him aside if I find him to be negligent, ignorant or unfaithful: and it would be ridiculous for
<PB N="286" REF="294"/>
 him to say, I make my self judg in my own case, for I only, or such as I shall consult, am fit to be the judg of it. He may be treacherous, and thro corruption or malice endeavour to poison me, or have other defects that render him unfit to be trusted: but I cannot by any corrupt passion be led wilfully to do him injustice, and if I mistake, 'tis only to my own hurt. The like may be said of Lawyers, Stewards, Pilots, and gene∣rally of all that do not act for themselves, but for those who employ them. And if a Company going to the <HI>Indys,</HI> should find that their Pilot was mad, drunk, or treacherous, they whose lives and goods are concern'd, can only be fit to judg, whether he ought to be trusted or not, since he cannot have a right to destroy those he was chosen to pre∣serve; and they cannot be thought to judg perversly, because they have nothing to lead them but an opinion of truth, and cannot err but to their own prejudice. In the like manner, not only <HI>Solon</HI> and <HI>Draco,</HI> but <HI>Romulus, Numa, Hostilius,</HI> the Consuls, Dictators and <HI>Decemviri,</HI> were not distinguish'd from others, that it might be well with them, <HI>Sed ut bonum, faelix, faustum{que} sit Populo Romano;</HI> but that the pros∣perity and happiness of the People might be procur'd: which being the thing always intended, it were absurd to refer the judgment of the per∣formance to him who is suspected of a design to overthrow it, and whose passions, interests, and vices, if he has any, lead him that way. If King <HI>James</HI> said any thing contrary to this, he might be answer'd with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Speech in Star-Chamber, <HI>1616.</HI></NOTE>some of his own words; <HI>I was,</HI> says he, <HI>sworn to maintain the Laws of the Land, and therefore had bin perjur'd if I had broken them.</HI> It may also be presum'd, he had not forgotten what his Master <HI>Buchanan</HI> had taught <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Scot.</NOTE>in the Books he wrote chiefly for his Instruction, that the violation of the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> could not have bin so fatal to most of his Predecessors, <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jure Reg. apud Scot.</NOTE>Kings of that Country (nor as he himself had made them to his Mother) if Kings as Kings were above them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XV. A general presumption that Kings will govern well, is not a sufficient security to the People.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BƲT,</HI> says our Author, <HI>yet will they rule their Subjects by the Law; and a King governing in a settled Kingdom, leaves to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, so soon as he ceases to rule according unto his Laws: Yet where he sees them rigorous or doubtful, he may mitigate or inter∣pret.</HI> This is therefore an effect of their goodness; they are above Laws, but will rule by Law, we have <HI>Filmer</HI>'s word for it. But I know not how Nations can be assur'd their Princes will always be so good: Good∣ness is always accompany'd with Wisdom, and I do not find those admi∣rable qualitys to be generally inherent or entail'd upon supreme Magi∣strats. They do not seem to be all alike, and we have not hitherto found them all to live in the same Spirit and Principle. I can see no resem∣blance between <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Caligula, Joshua</HI> and <HI>Claudius, Gideon</HI> and <HI>Nero, Samson</HI> and <HI>Vitellius, Samuel</HI> and <HI>Otho, David</HI> and <HI>Domitian;</HI> nor indeed between the best of these and their own Children. If the Sons of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Joshua</HI> had bin like to them in wisdom, valor and integrity, 'tis pro∣bable
<PB N="287" REF="295"/>
they had bin chosen to succeed them; if they were not, the like is less to be presum'd of others. No man has yet observ'd the Mode∣ration of <HI>Gideon</HI> to have bin in <HI>Abimelech;</HI> the Piety of <HI>Eli</HI> in <HI>Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phineas;</HI> the Purity and Integrity of <HI>Samuel</HI> in <HI>Joel</HI> and <HI>Abiah,</HI> nor the Wisdom of <HI>Solomon</HI> in <HI>Rehoboam.</HI> And if there was so vast a difference between them and their Children, who doubtless were instructed by those excellent men in the ways of Wisdom and Justice, as well by Pre∣cept as Example, were it not madness to be confident, that they who have neither precept nor good example to guide them, but on the con∣trary are educated in an utter ignorance or abhorrence of all vertue, will always be just and good; or to put the whole power into the hands of every man, woman, or child that shall be born in governing Familys, upon a supposition, that a thing will happen which never did; or that the weakest and worst will perform all that can be hop'd, and was sel∣dom accomplish'd by the wisest and best, exposing whole Nations to be destroy'd without remedy, if they do it not? And if this be madness in all extremity, 'tis to be presum'd that Nations never intended any such thing, unless our Author prove that all Nations have bin mad from the beginning, and must always continue to be so. To cure this, he says, <HI>They degenerate into Tyrants;</HI> and if he meant as he speaks, it would be enough. For a King cannot degenerate into a Tyrant by departing from that Law which is only the product of his own will. But if he do degenerate, it must be by departing from that which dos not depend upon his will, and is a rule prescrib'd by a power that is above him. This indeed is the Doctrin of <HI>Bracton,</HI> who having said that the Power of the King is the Power of the Law, because the Law makes him King, adds, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quia si faciat injuriam, definit esse Rex, &amp; degenerat in tyrannum, &amp; fit vicarius Diaboli. <BIBL>Bract.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>That if he do injustice, he ceases to be King, degenerates into a Tyrant, and becomes the Vicegerent of the Devil.</HI> But I hope this must be understood with temperament, and a due consideration of human frailty, so as to mean only those injurys that are extreme; for otherwise he would terribly shake all the Crowns of the World.</P>
<P>But lest our Author should be thought once in his life to have dealt sin∣cerely, and spoken truth, the next lines shew the fraud of his last Asser∣tion, by giving to the Prince a power of <HI>mitigating or interpreting the Laws that he sees to be rigorous or doubtful.</HI> But as he cannot degenerate into a Tyrant by departing from the Law which proceeds from his own will, so he cannot mitigate or interpret that which proceeds from a superior Power, unless the right of mitigating or interpreting be con∣fer'd upon him by the same. For as all wise men confess that <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cujus est instituere, ejus est abrogare.</NOTE><HI>none can abrogate but those who may institute,</HI> and that all mitigation and interpre∣tation varying from the true sense is an alteration, that alteration is an abrogation; for <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Quicquid mutatut dissolvitur, interit ergo.</NOTE>whatsoever is chang'd is dissolv'd, and therefore the power of mitigating is inseparable from that of instituting. This is sufficiently evidenc'd by <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's Answer to the Speech made to him by the Speaker of the House of Commons 1545. in which he, tho one of the most violent Princes we ever had, confesses the Parliament to be the Law-makers, and that an obligation lay upon him rightly to use the power with which he was entrusted. The right therefore of altering
<PB N="288" REF="296"/>
 being inseparable from that of making Laws, the one being in the Par∣liament, the other must be so also. <HI>Fortescue</HI> says plainly, the King cannot change any Law; <HI>Magna Charta</HI> casts all upon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leges terrae &amp; Consuetudines Angliae.</NOTE>the Laws of the Land and Customs of <HI>England:</HI> But to say that the King can by his will make that to be a Custom, or an antient Law, which is not, or that not to be so, which is, is most absurd. He must therefore take the Laws and Customs as he finds them, and can neither detract from, nor add any thing to them. The ways are prescrib'd as well as the end. Judgments are given by equals, <HI>per Pares.</HI> The Judges who may be assisting to those, are sworn to proceed according to Law, and not to regard the King's Letters or Commands. The doubtful Cases are re∣serv'd, and to be refer'd to the Parliament, as in the Statute of 35 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3<HI>d</HI> concerning Treasons, but never to the King. The Law intending that these Parliaments should be annual, and leaving to the King a power of calling them more often if occasion require, takes away all pretence of a necessity that there should be any other power to interpret or miti∣gate Laws. For 'tis not to be imagin'd that there should be such a pestilent evil in any antient Law, Custom, or later Act of Parliament, which being on the sudden discover'd, may not without any great pre∣judice continue for forty days, till a Parliament may be call'd; whereas the force and essence of all Laws would be subverted, if under color of mitigating and interpreting, the power of altering were allow'd to Kings, who often want the inclination, and for the most part the capa∣city of doing it rightly. 'Tis not therefore upon the uncertain will or understanding of a Prince, that the safety of a Nation ought to depend. He is sometimes a child, and sometimes overburden'd with years. Some are weak, negligent, slothful, foolish or vicious: others, who may have something of rectitude in their intentions, and naturally are not uncapable of doing well, are drawn out of the right way by the subtilty of ill men who gain credit with them. That rule must always be un∣certain, and subject to be distorted, which depends upon the fancy of a man. He always fluctuates, and every passion that arises in his mind, or is infus'd by others, disorders him. The good of a People ought to be establish'd upon a more solid foundation. For this reason the Law is establish'd, which no passion can disturb. 'Tis void of desire and fear, lust and anger. 'Tis <HI>Mens sine affectu,</HI> written Reason, retaining some measure of the Divine Perfection. It dos not enjoin that which pleases a weak, frail man, but without any regard to persons commands that which is good, and punishes evil in all, whether rich or poor, high or low. 'Tis deaf, inexorable, inflexible.</P>
<P>By this means every man knows when he is safe or in danger, because he knows whether he has done good or evil. But if all depended upon the will of a man, the worst would be often the most safe, and the best in the greatest hazard: Slaves would be often advanc'd, the good and the brave scorn'd and neglected. The most generous Nations have above all things sought to avoid this evil: and the vertue, wisdom and generosity of each may be discern'd by the right fixing of the rule that must be the guide of every man's life, and so constituting their Magi∣stracy that it may be duly observ'd. Such as have attain'd to this per∣fection, have always flourish'd in vertue and happiness: They are, as
<PB N="289" REF="297"/>
<HI>Aristotle</HI> says, govern'd by God, rather than by men, whilst those who subjected themselves to the will of a man were govern'd by a beast.</P>
<P>This being so, our Author's next clause, That <HI>tho a King do frame all his Actions to be according unto Law, yet he is not bound thereunto, but as his good will, and for good example, or so far forth as the general Law for the safety of the Commonwealth doth naturally bind him,</HI> is wholly im∣pertinent. For if the King who governs not according to Law, de∣generates into a Tyrant, he is oblig'd to frame his actions according to Law, or not to be a King; for a Tyrant is none, but as contrary to him, as the worst of men is to the best. But if these obligations were unty'd, we may easily guess what security our Author's words can be to us, that the King of his own good will, and for a good example, will frame his actions according to the Laws; when experience instructs us, that not∣withstanding the strictest Laws, and most exquisite Constitutions, that men of the best abilitys in the world could ever invent to restrain the irregular appetites of those in power, with the dreadful examples of vengeance taken against such as would not be restrain'd, they have fre∣quently broken out; and the most powerful have for the most part no otherwise distinguish'd themselves from the rest of men, than by the enormity of their vices, and being the most forward in leading others to all manner of crimes by their example.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVI. The observation of the Laws of Nature is absurdly expected from Tyrants, who set themselves up against all Laws: and he that subjects Kings to no other Law than what is common to Tyrants, destroys their being.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's last clause, acknowledging Kings to be bound by a general Law to provide for the safety of the People, would be sufficient for my purpose if it were sincere; for municipal Laws do only shew how that should be perform'd: and if the King by departing from that rule degenerates, as he says, into a Tyrant, 'tis easily deter∣min'd what ought then to be done by the People. But his whole Book being a heap of contradictions and frauds, we can rely upon nothing that he says: And his following words, which under the same Law comprehend both Kings and Tyrants, shew that he intends Kings should be no otherwise oblig'd than Tyrants, which is, not at all. <HI>By this means,</HI> says he, <HI>are all Kings, even Tyrants and Conquerors, bound to pre∣serve the Lands, Goods, Libertys and Lives of all their Subjects, not by any municipal Law of the Land, so much as by the natural Law of a Father, which obligeth them to ratify the Acts of their Forefathers and Predecessors in things necessary for the publick good of their Subjects.</HI> If he be therefore in the right, Tyrants and Conquerors are Kings and Fathers. The words that have bin always thought to comprehend the most irreconcila∣ble contrariety, the one expressing the most tender love and care, evi∣dently testify'd by the greatest obligations confer'd upon those who are under it; the other the utmost of all injurys that can be offer'd to men, signify the same thing: There is no difference between a Magistrate who
<PB N="290" REF="298"/>
 is what he is by Law, and a publick Enemy, who by force or fraud sets himself up against all Law: And what he said before, that Kings degene∣rated into Tyrants, signifys nothing, for Tyrants also are Kings.</P>
<P>His next words are no less incomprehensible; for neither King nor Ty∣rant can be oblig'd to preserve the Lands, Goods and Libertys of their Subjects if they have none. But as Liberty consists only in being subject to no man's will, and nothing denotes a Slave but a dependence upon the will of another; if there be no other Law in a Kingdom than the will of a Prince, there is no such thing as Liberty. Property also is an ap∣pendage to Liberty; and 'tis as impossible for a man to have a right to Lands or Goods, if he has no Liberty, and enjoys his Life only at the pleasure of another, as it is to enjoy either when he is depriv'd of 'em. He therefore who says Kings and Tyrants are bound to preserve their Subjects Lands, Libertys, Goods and Lives, and yet lays for a foundation, that Laws are no more than the significations of their Pleasure, seeks to delude the world with words which signify nothing.</P>
<P>The vanity of these Whimsys will farther appear, if it be consider'd, that as Kings are Kings by Law, and Tyrants are Tyrants by overthrowing the Law, they are most absurdly join'd together; and 'tis not more ridi∣culous to set him above the Law, who is what he is by the Law, than to expect the observation of the Laws that enjoin the preservation of the Lands, Libertys, Goods and Lives of the People, from one who by fraud or violence makes himself master of all, that he may be restrain'd by no Law, and is what he is by subverting all Law.</P>
<P>Besides, if the <HI>safety of the People</HI> be <HI>the supreme Law,</HI> and this safety extend to, and consist in the preservation of their Libertys, Goods, Lands and Lives, that Law must necessarily be the root and beginning, as well as the end and limit of all magistratical Power, and all Laws must be subservient and subordinate to it. The question will not then be what plea∣ses the King, but what is good for the People; not what conduces to his profit or glory, but what best secures the Libertys he is bound to preserve: he dos not therefore reign for himself, but for the People; he is not the Master, but the Servant of the Commonwealth; and the utmost extent of his Prerogative is to be able to do more good than any private Man. If this be his work and duty, 'tis easily seen whether he is to judg of his own performance, or they by whom and for whom he reigns; and whether in order to this he be to give Laws, or to receive them. 'Tis or∣dinarily said in <HI>France, Il faut que chacun soit servi à sa mode;</HI> Every man's business must be done according to his own mind: and if this be true in particular Persons, 'tis more plainly so in whole Nations. Many eyes see more than one: the collected wisdom of a People much surpasses that of a single Person; and tho he should truly seek that which is best, 'tis not probable he would so easily find it, as the body of a Nation, or the principal men chosen to represent the whole. This may be said with justice of the best and wisest Princes that ever were; but another Lan∣guage is to be us'd when we speak of those who may succeed, and who very often, thro the defects of Age, Person, or Sex, are neither fit to judg of other mens affairs, nor of their own; and are so far from being ca∣pable of the highest Concernments relating to the safety of whole Na∣tions, that the most trivial cannot reasonably be refer'd to them.</P>
<P>There are few men (except such as <HI>Filmer,</HI> who by bidding defiance to the Laws of God and Man, seems to declare war against both) whom I would not trust to determin whether a People, that can never fall into
<PB N="291" REF="299"/>
Nonage or Dotage, and can never fail of having men of Wisdom and Vertue amongst 'em, be not more fit to judg in their own Persons, or by Representatives, what conduces to their own good, than one who at a venture may be born in a certain Family, and who, besides his own Infir∣mitys, Passions, Vices, or Interests, is continually surrounded by such as endeavour to divert him from the ways of Truth and Justice. And if no reasonable man dare prefer the latter before the former, we must rely up∣on the Laws made by our Forefathers, and interpreted by the Nation, and not upon the will of a man.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to say that a wise and good Council may supply the defects, or correct the Vices of a young, foolish, or ill dispos'd King. For <HI>Filmer</HI> denys that a King, whatever he be without exception, (for he attributes profound wisdom to all) is oblig'd to follow the advice of his Council; and even he himself would hardly have had the impudence to say, That good Counsel given to a foolish or wicked Prince were of any value, unless he were oblig'd to follow it. This Council must be chosen by him, or impos'd upon him: if it be impos'd upon him, it must be by a Power that is above him, which he says cannot be. If chosen by one who is weak, foolish, or wicked, it can never be good; because such vertue and wisdom is requir'd to discern and chuse a few good and wise men, from a multitude of foolish and bad, as he has not. And it will generally fall out, that he will take for his Counsellors rather those he believes to be addicted to his Person or Interests, than such as are fitly qualify'd to perform the duty of their places. But if he should by chance, or contrary to his intentions, make choice of some good and wise men, the matter would not be much mended, for they will certainly differ in opinion from the worst. And tho the Prince should intend well, of which there is no assurance, nor any reason to put so great a power into his hands if there be none; 'tis almost impossible for him to avoid the snares that will be laid to seduce him. I know not how to put a better face upon this mat∣ter: for if I examin rather what is probable than possible, foolish or ill Princes will never chuse such as are wise and good; but favouring those who are most like to themselves, will prefer such as second their vices, humors, and personal Interests, and by so doing will rather fortify and rivet the evils that are brought upon the Nation thro their defects, than cure them. This was evident in <HI>Rehoboam:</HI> he had good Counsel, but he would not hearken to it. We know too many of the same sort; and tho it were not impossible (as <HI>Machiavelli</HI> says it is) for a weak Prince to receive any benefit from a good Council, we may certainly conclude, that a People can never expect any good from a Council chosen by one who is weak or vicious.</P>
<P>If a Council be impos'd upon him, and he be oblig'd to follow their ad∣vice, it must be impos'd by a Power that is above him; his Will there∣fore is not a Law, but must be regulated by the Law: the Monarchy is not above the Law; and if we will believe our Author, 'tis no Monarchy, because the Monarch has not his will, and perhaps he says true. For if that be an Aristocracy, where those that are, or are reputed to be the best do govern, then that is certainly a mix'd State, in which the will of one man dos not prevail. But if Princes are not oblig'd by the Law, all that is founded upon that supposition falls to the ground: They will always follow their own humors, or the suggestions of those who second them. <HI>Tiberius</HI> hearken'd to none but <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> or the ministers of his impu∣ritys and crueltys: <HI>Claudius</HI> was govern'd by Slaves, and the profligate
<PB N="292" REF="300"/>
 Strumpets his Wives. There were many wise and good men in the Se∣nat during the reigns of <HI>Caligula, Nero,</HI> and <HI>Domitian;</HI> but instead of following their Counsel, they endeavour'd to destroy them all, lest they should head the People against them; and such Princes as resemble them will always follow the like courses.</P>
<P>If I often repeat these hateful names, 'tis not for want of fresher exam∣ples of the same nature; but I chuse such as Mankind has universally condemn'd, against whom I can have no other cause of hatred than what is common to all those who have any love to vertue, and which can have no other relation to the Controversys of later Ages, than what may flow from the similitude of their causes, rather than such as are too well known to us, and which every man, according to the measure of his experience, may call to mind in reading these. I may also add, that as nothing is to be receiv'd as a general Maxim, which is not generally true, I need no more to overthrow such as <HI>Filmer</HI> proposes, than to prove how frequently they have bin found false, and what desperate mischiefs have bin brought upon the World as often as they have bin practis'd, and excessive Powers put into the hands of such as had neither inclination nor ability to make a good use of them: And therefore,</P>
<P>1. If the safety of Nations be the end for which Governments are in∣stituted, such as take upon them to govern, by what Title soever, are by the Law of Nature bound to procure it; and in order to this, to preserve the Lives, Lands, Libertys and Goods of every one of their Subjects: and he that upon any title whatsoever pretends, assumes, or exercises a power of disposing of them according to his own will, violates the Laws of Nature in the highest degree.</P>
<P>2. If all Princes are oblig'd by the Law of Nature to preserve the Lands, Goods, Lives and Libertys of their Subjects, those Subjects have by the Law of Nature a right to their Libertys, Lands, Goods, &amp;c. and cannot depend upon the will of any man, for that dependance destroys Liberty, &amp;c.</P>
<P>3. Ill men will not, and weak men cannot provide for the safety of the People; nay the work is of such extreme difficulty, that the greatest and wisest men that have bin in the world are not able by themselves to per∣form it; and the assistance of Counsel is of no use, unless Princes are oblig'd to follow it. There must be therefore a power in every State to restrain the ill, and to instruct weak Princes by obliging them to follow the Counsels given, else the ends of Government cannot be accomplish'd, nor the rights of Nations preserv'd.</P>
<P>All this being no more than what is said by our Author, or necessarily to be deduc'd from his Propositions, one would think he were become as good a Commonwealths-man as <HI>Cato;</HI> but the wash'd Swine will return to the Mire. He overthrows all by a preposterous conjunction of the rights of Kings which are just and by Law, with those of Tyrants which are utterly against Law; and gives the sacred and gentle name of Father to those Beasts, who by their actions declare themselves enemys not only to all Law and Justice, but to Mankind that cannot subsist without them. This requires no other proof, than to examin whether <HI>Attila</HI> or <HI>Tamerlan</HI> did well deserve to be call'd Fathers of the Countrys they destroy'd. The first of these was usually call'd the scourge of God, and he glory'd in the Name. The other being reprov'd for the detestable crueltys he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>.</NOTE>exercis'd, made answer, <HI>You speak to me as to a man; I am not a man, but the scourge of God and plague of Mankind.</HI> This is certainly sweet and
<PB N="293" REF="301"/>
gentle Language, savouring much of a fatherly tenderness: There is no doubt that those who use it will provide for the safety of the Nations un∣der them, and the preservation of the Laws of Nature is rightly refer'd to them; and 'tis also very probable, that they who come to burn the Countrys, and destroy the Nations that fall under their power, should make it their business to preserve them, and look upon the former Gover∣nors <HI>as their Fathers, whose Acts they are oblig'd to confirm,</HI> tho they seldom attain to the Dominion by any other means than the slaughter of them and their Familys.</P>
<P>But if the enmity be not against the Nation, and the cause of the war be only for Dominion against the ruling Person or Family, as that of <HI>Baasha</HI> against the house of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> of <HI>Zimri</HI> against that of <HI>Baasha,</HI> of <HI>Omri</HI> against <HI>Zimri,</HI> and of <HI>Jehu</HI> against <HI>Joram,</HI> the prosecution of it is a strange way of becoming the Son of the Person destroy'd. And <HI>Filmer</HI> alone is subtil enough to discover, that <HI>Jehu</HI> by extinguishing the house of <HI>Ahab,</HI> drew an obligation upon himself, of looking on him as his Father, and confirming his acts. If this be true, <HI>Moses</HI> was oblig'd to confirm the acts of the Kings of the <HI>Amalekites, Moabites</HI> and <HI>Amo∣rites</HI> that he destroy'd; the same duty lay upon <HI>Joshua,</HI> in relation to the <HI>Canaanites:</HI> but 'tis not so easily decided, to which of them he did owe that deference; for the same could not be due to all, and 'tis hard to be∣lieve, that by killing above thirty Kings, he should purchase to himself so many Fathers; and the like may be said of divers others.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is a sort of Tyrant who has no Father, as <HI>Agathocles, Dio∣nysius, Cesar,</HI> and generally all those who subvert the Libertys of their own Country. And if they stood oblig'd to look upon the former Magistrats as their Predecessors, and to confirm their Acts, the first should have bin to give impunity and reward to any that would kill them, it having bin a fundamental Maxim in those States, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ui{que} licere Tyrannum occidere.</NOTE><HI>That any man might kill a Tyrant.</HI></P>
<P>This being in all respects ridiculous and absurd, 'tis evident that our Author, who by proposing such a false security to Nations for their Liber∣tys, endeavours to betray them, is not less treacherous to Kings, when under a pretence of defending their Rights, he makes them to be the same with those of Tyrants, who are known to have none (and are Tyrants because they have none) and gives no other hopes to Nations of being preserv'd by the Kings they set up for that end, than what upon the same account may be expected from Tyrants, whom all wise men have ever abhor'd, and affirm'd to have bin <HI>produc'd</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In generis humani exitium natos.</NOTE><HI>to bring destruction upon the World,</HI> and whose Lives have verify'd the Sentence.</P>
<P>This is truly to depose and abolish Kings, by abolishing that by which and for which they are so. The greatness of their Power, Riches, State, and the pleasures that accompany them cannot but create enemys. Some will envy that which is accounted Happiness; others may dislike the use they make of their Power: some may be unjustly exasperated by the best of their Actions when they find themselves incommoded by them; others may be too severe judges of slight miscarriages. These things may rea∣sonably temper the joys of those who delight most in the advantages of Crowns. But the worst and most dangerous of all their enemys are these accursed Sycophants, who, by making those that ought to be the best of men, like to the worst, destroy their Being; and by persuading the world they aim at the same things, and are bound to no other rule than is com∣mon to all Tyrants, give a fair pretence to ill men to say, They are all of
<PB N="294" REF="302"/>
 one kind. And if this should be receiv'd for truth, even they who think the miscarriages of their Governors may be easily redrest, and desire no more, would be the most fierce in procuring the destruction of that which is naught in Principle, and cannot be corrected.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVII. Kings cannot be the Interpreters of the Oaths they take.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's Book is so full of absurditys and contradictions, that it would be a rope of Sand, if a continu'd series of frauds did not, like a string of Poisons running thro the whole, give it some consist∣ence with it self, and shew it to be the work of one and the same hand. After having endeavour'd to subvert the Laws of God, Nature and Na∣tions, most especially our own, by abusing the Scriptures, falsly alledging the Authority of many good Writers, and seeking to obtrude upon Man∣kind a universal Law, that would take from every Nation the right of constituting such Governments within themselves as seem most convenient for them, and giving rules for the administration of such as they had esta∣blish'd, he gives us a full view of his Religion and Morals, by destroying the force of the Oath taken by our Kings at their Coronation. <HI>Others,</HI> says he, <HI>affirm, that altho Laws of themselves do not bind Kings, yet the Oaths of Kings at their Coronation ty them to keep all the Laws of their King∣doms. How far this is true, let us but examin the Oath of the Kings of</HI> Eng∣land <HI>at their Coronation, the words whereof are these. Art thou pleas'd to cause to be administer'd in all thy judgments, indifferent and upright Justice, and to use discretion with Mercy and Verity? Art thou pleas'd that our up∣right Laws and Customs be observ'd, and dost thou promise that those shall be protected and maintain'd by thee?</HI> &amp;c. To which the King <HI>answers in the Affirmative, being first demanded by the Archbishop of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>Pleaseth it you to confirm and observe the Laws and Customs of the antient times, granted from God by just and devout Kings unto the English Nation, by Oath unto the said People, especially the Laws, Libertys and Customs granted unto the Clergy and Laity by the famous King</HI> Edward? From this he infers, That the King <HI>is not to observe all Laws, but such as are upright, because he finds evil Laws mention'd in the Oath of</HI> Richard <HI>the</HI> 2d, <HI>which he swears to abolish: Now what Laws are upright and what evil, who shall judg but the King? &amp;c. So that in effect the King doth swear to keep no Laws but such as in his judgment are upright, &amp;c. And if he did strictly swear to observe all Laws, he could not without Perjury give his consent to the repealing or abro∣gating of any Statute by Act of Parliament,</HI> &amp;c. And again, <HI>But let it be suppos'd for Truth, the Kings do swear to observe all Laws of their King∣doms; yet no man can think it reason, that the Kings should be more bound by their voluntary Oaths than common Persons: Now if a private Person make a Contract, either with Oath or without Oath, he is no farther bound than the equity and justice of the Contract tys him; for a man may have relief a∣gainst an unreasonable and unjust Promise, if either deceit or error, force or fear induc'd him thereunto; or if it be hurtful or grievous in the performance, since the Law in many cases gives the King a Prerogative above common persons.</HI> Lest I should be thought to insist upon small advantages, I will not oblige any man to shew where <HI>Filmer</HI> found this Oath, nor observe the faults committed in the Translation; but notwithstanding his false representa∣tion, I find enough for my purpose, and intend to take it in his own words.
<PB N="295" REF="303"/>
But first I shall take leave to remark, that those who for private interests addict themselves to the personal service of Princes, tho to the ruin of their Country, find it impossible to persuade Mankind that Kings may govern as they please, when all men know there are Laws to direct and restrain them, unless they can make men believe they have their power from a universal and superior Law; or that Princes can attempt to dissolve the obligations laid upon them by the Laws, which they so solemnly swear to observe, without rendring themselves detestable to God and Man, and subject to the revenging hands of both, unless they can invalidate those Oaths. Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> I think was the first, who very ingeniously contriv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. de Cive▪</NOTE>a compendious way of justifying the most abominable Perjurys, and all the mischiefs ensuing thereupon, by pretending, that as the King's Oath is made to the People, the People may absolve him from the obligation; and that the People having confer'd upon him all the Power they had, he can do all that they could: he can therefore absolve himself, and is actu∣ally free, since he is so when he pleases. This is only false in the minor: for the People not having confer'd upon him all, but only a part of their Power, that of absolving him remains in themselves, otherwise they would never have oblig'd him to take the Oath. He cannot therefore absolve himself. The Pope indeed finds a help for this, and as Christ's Vicar pretends the power of Absolution to be in him, and exercis'd it in ab∣solving K. <HI>John.</HI> But our Author despairing to impose either of these up∣on our Age and Nation, with more impudence and less wit, would ener∣vate all Coronation-Oaths by subjecting them to the discretion of the taker; whereas all men have hitherto thought their force to consist in the declar'd sense of those who give them. This doctrin is so new, that it surpasses the subtilty of the Schoolmen, who, as an ingenious Person said of 'em, had minc'd Oaths so fine, that a million of 'em, as well as Angels, may stand upon the point of a needle; and were never yet equal'd but by the Jesuits, who have overthrown them by mental reservations; which is so clearly demonstrated from their books, that it cannot be deny'd, but so horrible, that even those of their own Order who have the least spark of common honesty condemn the practice. And one of them, being a Gentleman of a good family, told me, he would go the next day and take all the Oaths that should be offer'd, if he could satisfy his conscience in using any manner of equivocation or mental reservation, that he might put any other sense upon them, than he knew to be intend∣ed by those who offer'd them. And if our Author's conscience were not more corrupted than that of the Jesuit, who had liv'd fisty years under the worst Disciplin that I think ever was in the world, I would ask him seriously, if he truly believe, that the Nobility, Clergy and Commonal∣ty os <HI>England,</HI> who have bin always so zealous for their antient Laws, and so resolute in defending 'em, did mean no more by the Oaths they so solemnly impos'd, and upon which they laid so much weight, than that the King should swear to keep 'em, so far only as he should think fit.</P>
<P>But <HI>he swears only to observe those that are upright,</HI> &amp;c. How can that be understood otherwise than that those who give the Oath, do declare their Laws and Customs to be upright and good, and he by taking the Oath affirms them to be so? Or how can they be more precisely specify'd than by the ensuing Clause, <HI>Granted from God by just and devout Kings by Oath, especially those os the samous King</HI> Edward? But, says he, by the same Oath <HI>Richard the</HI> 2d <HI>was bound to abolish those that were evil.</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any such had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ept in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hro error, or bin obtruded by malice, the evil being dis∣cover'd
<PB N="296" REF="304"/>
 and declar'd by the Nobility and Commons who were concern'd, he was not to take advantage of them, or by his refusal to evade the abolition, but to join with his people in annulling them, according to the general Clause of assenting to those <HI>Quas vulgus elegerit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Magna Charta</HI> being only an abridgment of our antient Laws and Customs, the King that swears to it, swears to them all; and not being admitted to be the interpreter of it, or to determin what is good or evil, fit to be observ'd or annul'd in it, can have no more power over the rest. This having bin confirm'd by more Parliaments than we have had Kings since that time, the same obligation must still lie upon them all, as upon <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> in whose time that claim of right was compil'd. The Act was no less solemn than important; and the most dreadful curses that could be conceiv'd in words, which were denounc'd against such as should any way infringe it, by the Clergy in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> in the presence and with the assent of K. <HI>Henry</HI> III. many of the principal Nobility, and all the Estates of the Kingdom, shew whether it was refer'd to the King's Judg∣ment or not; when 'tis evident they fear'd the violation from no other than himself, and such as he should employ. I confess the Church (as they then call'd the Clergy) was fallen into such corruption, that their Arms were not much to be fear'd by one who had his conscience clear; but that could not be in the case of perjury: and our Ancestors could do no better, than to imploy the spiritual sword, reserving to themselves the use of the other in case that should be despis'd. Tho the Pope's Excommunications prov'd sometimes to be but <HI>bruta fulmina,</HI> when a just cause was want∣ing, it may be easily judg'd what obedience a Prince could expect from his Subjects, when every man knew he had by perjury drawn the most heavy curses upon himself. K. <HI>John</HI> was certainly wicked, but he durst not break these bonds till he had procur'd the Pope's absolution for a cover; and when he had done so, he found himself unsafe under it, and could not make good what he had promis'd to the Pope to obtain it, the Parliament declaring that his grants to the Pope were unjust, illegal, contrary to his Coronation-Oath, and that they would not be held by them. This went so far in that King's time, that Writs were issued out to men of all con∣ditions to oblige themselves by oath to keep the great Charter; and if o∣ther means sail'd, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Er quod ipsum Regem per captionem distringerent &amp; gravarent ad prafata exequenda.</NOTE><HI>to compel the King to perform the conditions.</HI> 'Tis ex∣presly said in his Charter, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Et ip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Barones cum Communitate totius terra distringent &amp; gravabunt nos modis omnibus qui∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us poterunt, sci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cet per captionem castrorum, terrarum, pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sionum, &amp; aliis modis quibus potuerint, don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> emendatum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uerit secundum arbitrium cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</NOTE><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Barons and Commonalty of the land shall straiten and compel us by all means possible, as by seiz∣ing our Towns, Lands, and Possessions, or any other way, till satis∣faction be made according to their pleasure."</Q> And in the Charter of his Son <HI>Henry,</HI> 'tis, upon the same supposition of not performing the agree∣ment, said, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Licet omnibus de regno nostro contra no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsurg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, &amp; omni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gravamen nostrum re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>piciant▪ a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nobi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n nul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rentur.</NOTE><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It shall be lawful for all men in our Kingdom to rise up against us, and to do all things that may be grievous to us, as if they were absolutely free from any engagements to our person."</Q> These words seem to have bin contriv'd to be so full and strong <HI>propter duplicita∣tem Regis,</HI> which was with too much reason suspected.

no more than what they made him, and had nothing but what they gave him: nor the language of a Lord treating with such as enjoy'd their liber∣tys by his favor, but with those whom he acknowledg'd to be the Judges of his performing what had bin stipulated; and equals the agreements made between the Kings and People of <HI>Arragon,</HI> which I cited before from the Relations of <HI>Antonio Perez.</HI> This is as far as men can go; and the experience of all ages manifests, that Princes performing their office, and observing these Stipulations, have liv'd glorious, happy and belov'd: and I can hardly find an example of any who have notoriously broken these Oaths, and bin adjudg'd to have incur'd the Penaltys, who have not liv'd miserably, dy'd shamefully, and left an abominable memory to posterity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, says our Author, Kings cannot be more oblig'd by voluntary Oaths than other men, and may be reliev'd from unjust and unreasonable promises, if they be induc'd by deceit, error, force or fear, or the performance be grievous."</Q> Which is to say, that no Oath is of any obli∣gation: for there is none that is not voluntary or involuntary, and there never was any upon which some such thing may not be pretended, which would be the same if such as <HI>Filmer</HI> had the direction of their consciences who take the Oaths, and of those who are to exact the performance. This would soon destroy all confidence between King and People, and not only unhinge the best establish'd Governments, but by a detestable practice of annihilating the force of Oaths and most solemn Contracts that can be made by men, overthrow all Societys that subsist by them. I leave it to all reasonable men to judg how fit a work this would be for the supreme Magistrate, who is advanc'd to the highest degree of human glory and happiness, that he may preserve them; and how that Justice, for the obtaining of which Governments are constituted, can be admi∣nister'd, if he who is to exact it from others, dos in his own person ut∣terly subvert it; and what they deserve, who by such base prevarica∣tions would teach 'em to pervert and abolish the most sacred of all Con∣tracts. A worthy person of our Age was accustom'd to say that Con∣tracts in writing were invented only to bind Villains, who having no Law, Justice or Truth within themselves, would not keep their words, unless such testimonys were given as might compel them. But if our Author's Doctrin were receiv'd, no contract would be of more value than a Cobweb. Such as are not absolutely of a profligate conscience, so far reverence the religion of an Oath, to think that even those which are most unjustly and violently impos'd, ought to be observ'd; and <HI>Julius Cesar,</HI> who I think was not over-scrupulous, when he was taken by Py∣rats, and set at liberty upon his word, caus'd the Ransom he had promis'd to be paid to them. We see the like is practis'd every day by Prisoners taken in unjust as well as just Wars: And there is no honest man that would not abhor a Person, who being taken by the Pyrats of <HI>Algier</HI> should not pay what he had promis'd for his Liberty. 'Twere in vain to say they had no right of exacting, or that the performance was grievous; he must return to the chains, or pay. And tho the People of <HI>Artois, Al∣satia,</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI> do perhaps with reason think the King of <HI>France</HI> has no right to impose Oaths of Allegiance upon them, no man doubts, that if they chuse rather to take those Oaths, than to suffer what might ensue upon their refusal, they are as much bound to be faithful to him as his an∣tient Subjects.</P>
<P>The like may be said of promises extorted by fraud; and no other example is necessary to prove they are to be perform'd than that of <HI>Jo∣shua</HI>
<PB N="298" REF="306"/>
 made to the <HI>Gibeonites.</HI> They were an accursed Nation, which he was commanded to destroy: They came to him with lies, and by deceit induc'd him to make a League with them, which he ought not to have done; but being made, it was to be perform'd, and on that account he did not only spare but defend them, and the action was approv'd by God. When <HI>Saul</HI> by a preposterous zeal violated that League, the Anger of God for that breach of faith could no otherwise be appeas'd than by the death of seven of his Children. This case is so full, so precise, and of such undoubted authority, that I shall not trouble my self with any o∣ther. But if we believe our man of good morals, voluntary Oaths and Promises are of no more value than those gain'd by force or deceit, that is to say, none are of any. For voluntary signifying nothing but free, all human Acts are either free or not free, that is, from the will of the person, or some impulse from without. If therefore there be no force in those that are free, nor in those that are not free, there is none in any.</P>
<P>No better use can be made of any <HI>pretension of error,</HI> or that the <HI>per∣formance was grievous;</HI> for no man ought to be griev'd at the performance of his Contract. <HI>David</HI> assures us, that a good man performs his agree∣ment tho he lose by it; and the Lord Chancellor <HI>Egerton</HI> told a Gentle∣man, who desir'd relief against his own Deed, upon an Allegation that he knew not what he did when he sign'd it, that he did not sit to relieve fools.</P>
<P>But tho voluntary Promises or Oaths, when, to use the Lawyers lan∣guage, there is not a valuable consideration, were of no obligation; or that men brought by force, fear or error, into such Contracts as are grie∣vous in the performance, might be reliev'd; this would not at all reach the cases of Princes, in the Contracts made between them and their Sub∣jects, and confirm'd by their Oaths, there being no color of force or fraud, fear or error for them to alledg; nor any thing to be pretended that can be grievous to perform, otherwise than as it may be grievous to an ill man not to do the mischiefs he had conceiv'd.</P>
<P>Nations according to their own will frame the Laws by which they resolve to be govern'd; and if they do it not wisely, the damage i only to themselves. But 'tis hard to find an example of any People that did by force oblige a man to take upon him the Government of them. <HI>Gideon</HI> was indeed much press'd by the <HI>Israelites</HI> to be their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing; and the Army of <HI>Germanicus</HI> in a Mutiny more fiercely urg'd him to be Emperor; but both desisted when their Offers were refus'd. If our Kings have bin more modest, and our Ancestors more pertinacious in compelling them to ac∣cept the Crowns they offer'd, I shall upon proof of the matter change my opinion. But till that do appear, I may be pardon'd if I think there was no such thing. <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI> was not by force brought into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but came voluntarily, and desir'd to be King: The Nobility, Cler∣gy, and Commons propos'd the Conditions upon which they would re∣ceive him. These conditions were to govern according to their antient Laws, especially those that had bin granted, or rather collected in the time of the famous King <HI>Edward.</HI> Here was neither force nor fraud; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had dislik'd the terms, he might have retir'd as freely as he came.

Oath upon the same Evangelists, and the Reliques of S. <HI>Alban,</HI> which he needed not to have done, but might have departed to his Dutchy of <HI>Nor∣mandy</HI> if he had not lik'd the conditions, or thought fit to observe them. 'Tis probable he examin'd the contents of <HI>Edward</HI>'s Laws before he <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bonas &amp; approbatas antiqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Regni Leges, quas sancti &amp; pii Reges ejus antecessores, &amp; maxime Edvardus statuit, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iolabiliter observare.</NOTE>swore to them, and could not imagin, that a free Nation which never had any other Kings than such as had bin chosen by themselves for the preserva∣tion of their Liberty, and from whose liberality the best of their Kings acknowledg'd the Crowns they wore, did intend to give up their Per∣sons, Libertys and Estates to him, who was a stranger, most especially when they would not receive him till he had sworn to the same Laws by which the others had reign'd, of which one was (as appears by the act of the <HI>Conventus Pananglicus)</HI> that <HI>Reges a Sacerdotibus &amp; senioribus Populi eligantur, The Kings should be elected by the Clergy and Elders of the People.</HI> By these means he was advanc'd to the Crown, to which he could have no title, unless they had the right of conferring it upon him. Here was therefore no force, deceit or error; and whatsoever equity there might be to relieve one that had bin forc'd, frighted or circumvented, it was nothing to this case. We do not find that <HI>William</HI> the 2<HI>d,</HI> or <HI>Henry,</HI> were forc'd to be Kings; no Sword was put to their Throats; and for any thing we know, the <HI>English</HI> Nation was not then so contemptible but men might have bin found in the world, who would willingly have accepted the Crown, and even their elder Brother <HI>Robert</HI> would not have refus'd: but the Nobility and Commons trusting to their Oaths and Pro∣mises, thought fit to prefer them before him; and when he endeavour'd to impose himself upon the Nation by force, they so severely punish'd him, that no better proof can be requir'd to shew they were accus∣tom'd to have no other Kings than such as they approv'd. And this was one of the Customs that all their Kings swore to maintain, it being as antient, just, and well approv'd as any other.</P>
<P>Having already prov'd, that all the Kings we have had since that time, have come in upon the same title; that the <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws to which all have sworn, continue to be of force amongst us, and that the words pronounc'd four times on the four sides of the Scaffold by the Archbishop, <HI>Will ye have this Man to reign?</HI> do testify it; I may spare the pains of a repetition, and justly conclude, That if there was neither force nor fraud, fear nor error, to be pretended by the first, there could be none in those that fol∣low'd.</P>
<P>But the <HI>observation of this Oath may be grievous.</HI> If I receiv'd mony the last year upon Bond, Promise, or sale of a Mannor or Farm, can it be thought grievous to me to be compel'd to repay, or make over the Land according to my agreement? Or if I did not seal the Bond till I had the mony, must not I perform the condition, or at the least restore what I had receiv'd? If it be grievous to any King to preserve the Libertys, Lives, and Estates of his Subjects, and to govern according to their Laws, let him resign the Crown, and the People to whom the Oath was made, will probably release him. Others may possibly be found who will not think it grievous: or if none will accept a Crown unless they may do what they please, the People must bear the misfortune of being oblig'd to govern themselves, or to institute some other sort of Magistra∣cy that will be satisfy'd with a less exorbitant Power. Perhaps they may
<PB N="300" REF="308"/>
 succeed as well as some others have done, who without being brought to that necessity, have voluntarily cast themselves into the misery of living without the majestick splendor of a Monarch: or if that fail, they may as their last refuge, surrender up themselves to Slavery. When that is done, we will acknowledg that whatsoever we have is deriv'd from the favor of our Master. But no such thing yet appearing amongst us, we may be pardon'd if we think we are Free-men govern'd by our own Laws, and that no man has a Power over us, which is not given and re∣gulated by them; nor that any thing but a new Law made by our selves, can exempt our Kings from the obligation of performing their Oaths taken, to govern according to the old, in the true sense of the words, as they are understood in our Language by those who give them, and conducing to the ends for which they are given, which can be no other than to defend us from all manner of arbitrary Power, and to fix a rule to which we are to conform our Actions, and from which, according to our deserts, we may expect reward or punishment. And those who by prevarications, cavils or equivocations, endeavour to dissolve these Obligations, do either maliciously betray the cause of Kings, by representing them to the world as men who prefer the satisfaction of their irregular Appetites before the performance of their duty, and trample under foot the most sacred bonds of human Society; or from the grossest ignorance do not see, that by teaching Nations how little they can rely upon the Oaths of their Princes, they instruct them as little to observe their own; and that not only because men are generally inclin'd to follow the examples of those in power, but from a most certain conclusion, that he who breaks his part of a Contract cannot without the utmost impu∣dence and folly expect the performance of the other; nothing being more known amongst men, than that all Contracts are of such mutual obligation, that he who fails of his part discharges the other. If this be so between man and man, it must needs be so between one and many millions of men: If he were free, because he says he is, every man must be free also when he pleases; if a private man who receives no benefit, or perhaps prejudice from a Contract, be oblig'd to perform the conditions, much more are Kings who receive the greatest advantages the world can give. As they are not by themselves nor for themselves, so they are not different <HI>in specie</HI> from other men: they are born, live and die as we all do. The same Law of Truth and Justice is given to all by God and Na∣ture; and perhaps I may say the performance of it is most rigorously exacted from the greatest of men. The liberty of Perjury cannot be a privilege annex'd to Crowns; and 'tis absurd to think that the most vene∣rable Authority that can be confer'd upon a man, is increas'd by a liberty to commit, or impunity in committing such crimes as are the greatest aggravations of infamy to the basest villains in the world.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVIII. The next in blood to deceas'd Kings cannot generally be said to be Kings till they are crown'd.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS hereupon usually objected, that Kings do not come in by Con∣tract nor by Oath, but are Kings by, or according to proximity of Blood, before they are crown'd. Tho this be a bold Proposition, I will not say 'tis universally false. 'Tis possible that in some places the rule of Succession may be set down so precisely, that in some cases every man may be able to see and know the sense, as well as the Person design'd to be the Successor: but before I acknowledg it to be universally true, I must desire to know what this rule of Succession is, and from whence it draws its original.</P>
<P>I think I may be excus'd if I make these scruples, because I find the thing in dispute to be variously adjudg'd in several places, and have ob∣serv'd five different manners of disposing Crowns esteem'd Hereditary, besides an infinite number of collateral Controversys arising from them, of which we have divers examples; and if there be one universal rule ap∣pointed, one of these only can be right, and all the others must be vicious. The first gives the inheritance to the eldest Male of the eldest legitimate Line, as in <HI>France,</HI> according to that which they call the <HI>Salique Law.</HI> The second, to the eldest legitimate Male of the reigning Family, as an∣tiently in <HI>Spain,</HI> according to which the Brother of the deceas'd King has bin often, if not always prefer'd before the Son, if he were elder, as may appear by the dispute between <HI>Corbis</HI> and <HI>Orsua,</HI> cited before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom <HI>Titus Livius;</HI> and in the same Country during the reign of the <HI>Goths,</HI> the eldest Male succeeded, whether Legitimate or Illegitimate. The fourth receives Females or their Descendents, without any other condition distin∣guishing them from Males, except that the younger Brother is prefer'd before the elder Sister, but the daughter of the elder Brother is prefer'd before the Son of the younger. The fifth gives the Inheritance to Females under a condition, as in <HI>Sweden,</HI> where they inherit, unless they marry out of the Country without the consent of the Estates; according to which rule <HI>Charles Gustavus</HI> was chosen, as any Stranger might have bin, tho Son to a Sister of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> who by marrying a <HI>German</HI> Prince had forfeited her right. And by the same act of Estates, by which her el∣dest Son was chosen, and the Crown entail'd upon the Heirs of his Body, her second Son the Prince <HI>Adolphus</HI> was wholly excluded.</P>
<P>Till these questions are decided by a Judg of such undoubted Authority, that all men may safely submit, 'tis hard for any man who really seeks the satisfaction of his Conscience, to know whether the Law of God and Nature (tho he should believe there is one general Law) do justify the Customs of the antient <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

<PB N="302" REF="310"/>
 as unfit to reign over men, and utterly unable to perform the duty of a supreme Magistrate, as we see they are every where excluded from the exercise of all other Offices in the Commonwealth. If it be said that we ought to follow the Customs of our own Country, I answer, that those of our own Country deserve to be observ'd, because they are of our own Country: But they are no more to be call'd the Laws of God and Nature than those of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Germany;</HI> and tho I do not be∣lieve that any general Law is appointed, I wish I were sure that our Customs in this point were not more repugnant to the light of Nature, and prejudicial to our selves, than those of some other Nations. But if I should be so much an <HI>English</HI>-man, to think the will of God to have bin more particularly reveal'd to our Ancestors, than to any other Nation, and that all of them ought to learn from us; yet it would be difficult to de∣cide many questions that may arise. For tho the Parliament in the 36<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, made an Act in favour of <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> descended from a Daughter of <HI>Mortimer,</HI> who marry'd the Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> elder Brother to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> they rather as∣serted their own power of giving the Crown to whom they pleas'd, than determin'd the question. For if they had believ'd that the Crown had belong'd to him by a general and eternal Law, they must immediately have rejected <HI>Henry</HI> as a Usurper, and put <HI>Richard</HI> into the possession of his Right, which they did not. And tho they did something like to this in the cases of <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress in relation to King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and her Son <HI>Henry</HI> the 2<HI>d;</HI> and of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th</HI> in relation to the house of <HI>York,</HI> both before he had marry'd a Daughter of it, and after her death; they did the contrary in the cases of <HI>William</HI> the first and second, <HI>Henry</HI> the 1<HI>st, Stephen, John, Richard</HI> the 3<HI>d, Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th, Mary, Elizabeth,</HI> and others. So that, for any thing I can yet find, 'tis equally difficult to discover the true sense of the Law of Nature that should be a guide to my Conscience, whether I so far submit to the Laws of my Country, to think that <HI>England</HI> alone has produc'd men that rightly understand it, or examin the Laws and Practices of other Nations.</P>
<P>Whilst this remains undecided, 'tis impossible for me to know to whom I owe the obedience that is exacted from me. If I were a <HI>French</HI>-man, I could not tell whether I ow'd allegiance to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> or many others descended from Daughters of the House of <HI>Valois,</HI> one of whom ought to inherit, if the Inheritance belongs to Fe∣males; or to the house of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> whose only title is founded upon the ex∣clusion of them. The like Controversys will be in all places; and he that would put Mankind upon such inquirys, goes about to subvert all the Go∣vernments of the World, and arms every man to the destruction of his neighbor.</P>
<P>We ought to be inform'd when this right began: If we had the Ge∣nealogy of every man from <HI>Noah,</HI> and the Crowns of every Nation had since his time continu'd in one Line, we were only to inquire into how many Kingdoms he appointed the World to be divided, and how well the division we see at this day agrees with the allotment made by him. But Mankind having for many ages lain under such a vast confusion, that no man pretends to know his own original, except some <HI>Jews,</HI> and the Princes of the house of <HI>Austria,</HI> we cannot so easily arrive at the end of our work; and the Scriptures making no other mention of this part of the world, than what may induce us to think it was given to the Sons of <HI>Japhet,</HI> we have nothing that can lead us to guess how it was to be subdi∣vided,
<PB N="303" REF="311"/>
nor to whom the several parcels were given: So that the difficultys are absolutely inextricable; and tho it were true, that some one man had a right to every parcel that is known to us, it could be of no use; for that Right must necessarily perish which no man can prove, nor indeed claim. But as all natural Rights by Inheritance must be by Descent, this Descent not being prov'd, there can be no natural Right; and all Rights being either natural, created or acquir'd, this Right to Crowns not being natural, must be created or acquir'd, or none at all.</P>
<P>There being no general Law common to all Nations, creating a Right to Crowns (as has bin prov'd by the several methods us'd by several Nations in the disposal of them, according to which all those that we know are enjoy'd) we must seek the Right concerning which we dispute, from the particular Constitutions of every Nation, or we shall be able to find none.</P>
<P>Acquir'd Rights are obtain'd, as men say, either by fair means or by foul, that is, by force or by consent: such as are gain'd by force, may be recover'd by force; and the extent of those that are enjoy'd by consent, can only be known by the reasons for which, or the conditions upon which that consent was obtain'd, that is to say, by the Laws of every People. According to these Laws it cannot be said that there is a King in every Nation before he is crown'd. <HI>John Sobietski</HI> now reigning in <HI>Poland,</HI> had no relation in blood to the former Kings, nor any title till he was chosen. The last King of <HI>Sweden</HI> acknowledg'd he had none, but was freely elected; and the Crown being confer'd upon him and the Heirs of his Body, if the present King dies without Issue, the right of electing a Successor returns undoubtedly to the Estates of the Country. The Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> was Elective till it was made Hereditary by an Act of the General Diet held at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> in the year 1660; and 'tis im∣possible that a Right should otherwise accrue to a younger Brother of the house of <HI>Holstein,</HI> which is deriv'd from a younger Brother of the Counts of <HI>Oldenburgh.</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> Empire having pass'd thro the hands of ma∣ny Persons of different Nations, no way relating to each other in blood, was by <HI>Constantine</HI> transfer'd to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and after many Revolu∣tions coming to <HI>Theodosius,</HI> by birth a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> was divided between his two Sons <HI>Arcadius</HI> and <HI>Honorius.</HI> From thence passing to such as could gain most credit with the Soldiers, the Western Empire being brought almost to nothing, was restor'd by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great of <HI>France;</HI> and con∣tinuing for some time in his descendents, came to the <HI>Germans;</HI> who having created several Emperors of the Houses of <HI>Suevia, Saxony, Ba∣varia</HI> and others, as they pleas'd, about three hundred years past chose <HI>Rodolphus</HI> of <HI>Austria:</HI> and tho since that time they have not had any Em∣peror who was not of that Family; yet such as were chosen had no∣thing to recommend them, but the merits of their Ancestors, their own personal Vertues, or such political considerations as might arise from the power of their hereditary Countrys, which being join'd with those of the Empire, might enable 'em to make the better defence against the <HI>Turks.</HI> But in this Line also they have had little regard to inheritance according to blood; for the elder branch of the Family is that which reigns in <HI>Spain;</HI> and the Empire continues in the descendents of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> younger Bro∣ther to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, tho so unfix'd even to this time, that the present Emperor <HI>Leopold</HI> was in great danger of being rejected.</P>
<P>If it be said that these are elective Kingdoms, and our Author speaks of such as are hereditary; I answer, that if what he says be true, there
<PB N="304" REF="312"/>
 can be no Elective Kingdom, and every Nation has a natural Lord to whom obedience is due. But if some are Elective, all might have bin so if they had pleas'd, unless it can be prov'd, that God created some un∣der a necessity of subjection, and left to others the enjoyment of their li∣berty. If this be so, the Nations born under that necessity may be said to have a natural Lord, who has all the power in himself, before he is crown'd, or any part confer'd on him by the consent of the people; but it cannot extend to others. And he who pretends a right over any Na∣tion upon that account, stands oblig'd to shew when and how that Na∣tion came to be discriminated by God from others, and depriv'd of that liberty which he in goodness had granted to the rest of mankind. I con∣fess I think there is no such Right, and need no better proof than the va∣rious ways of disposing Inheritances in several Countrys, which not be∣ing naturally or universally better or worse one than another, cannot spring from any other root, than the consent of the several Nations where they are in force, and their opinions that such methods were best for them. But if God has made a discrimination of people, he that would there∣upon ground a Title to the dominion of any one, must prove that Nation to be under the curse of Slavery, which for any thing I know, was only denounc'd against <HI>Cham:</HI> and 'tis as hard to determin whether the sense of it be temporal, spiritual, or both, as to tell precisely what Nations by being descended from him, fall under the Penaltys threaten'd.</P>
<P>If these therefore be either intirely false, or impossible to be prov'd true, there is no discrimination, or not known to us; and every People has a right of disposing of their Government, as well as the <HI>Polanders, Danes, Swedes, Germans,</HI> and such as are or were under the <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣pire. And if any Nation has a natural Lord before he be admitted by their consent, it must be by a peculiar act of their own; as the Crown of <HI>France</HI> by an act of that Nation, which they call the Salique Law, is made hereditary to Males in a direct Line, or the nearest to the direct; and others in other places are otherwise dispos'd.</P>
<P>I might rest here with full assurance that no Disciple of <HI>Filmer</HI> can prove this of any people in the world, nor give so much as the shadow of a reason to persuade us there is any such thing in any Nation, or at least in those where we are concern'd; and presume little regard will be had to what he has said, since he cannot prove of any that which he so boldly affirms of all. But because good men ought to have no other ob∣ject than Truth, which in matters of this importance can never be made too evident, I will venture to go farther, and assert, That as the various ways by which several Nations dispose of the succession to their respective Crowns, shew they were subject to no other Law than their own, which they might have made different, by the same right they made it to be what it is, even those who have the greatest veneration for the reigning Familys, and the highest regard for proximity of blood, have always prefer'd the safety of the Commonwealth before the concernments of any Person or Family, and have laid aside the nearest in blood, not only when they were found to be notoriously vicious and wicked, but when they have thought it more convenient to take others: And to prove this I intend to make use of no other Examples than those I find in the Historys of <HI>Spain, France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst the <HI>Goths</HI> govern'd <HI>Spain,</HI> not above four persons in the space of three hundred years were the immediate successors of their Fathers, but the Brother, Cousin German, or some other man of the Familys of the
<PB N="305" REF="313"/>
<HI>Balthei</HI> or <HI>Amalthei</HI> was prefer'd before the Children of the deceas'd King: and if it be said, this was according to the Law of that Kingdom, I an∣swer, that it was therefore in the power of that Nation to make Laws for themselves, and consequently others have the same right. One of their Kings call'd <HI>Wamba</HI> was depos'd and made a Monk after he had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saavedra Co∣ron. Goth.</NOTE>reign'd well many years; but falling into a swound, and his friends think∣ing him past recovery, cut off his hair, and put a Monk's Frock upon him, that, according to the superstition of those times, he might die in it; and the cutting off the hair being a most disgraceful thing amongst <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. Hist. l. 6.</NOTE>the <HI>Goths,</HI> they would not restore him to his Authority. <HI>Suintila</HI> another of their Kings being depriv'd of the Crown for his ill Government, his Children and Brothers were excluded, and <HI>Sisinandus</HI> crown'd in his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saavedra Co∣ron. Goth.</NOTE>room.</P>
<P>This Kingdom being not long after overthrown by the <HI>Moors,</HI> a new one arose from its ashes in the person of <HI>Don Pelayo</HI> first King of the <HI>Astu∣ria</HI>'s, which increasing by degrees at last came to comprehend all <HI>Spain,</HI> and so continues to this day: But not troubling my self with all the de∣viations from the common rule in the collateral Lines of <HI>Navarr, Arragon</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> I find that by fifteen several Instances in that one series of Kings in the <HI>Asturia</HI>'s and <HI>Leon</HI> (who afterwards came to be Kings of <HI>Castille)</HI> it is fully prov'd, that what respect soever they shew'd to the next in blood, who by the Law were to succeed, they prefer'd some other per∣son, as often as the supreme Law of <HI>taking care that the Nation might re∣ceive no detriment,</HI> persuaded them to it.</P>
<P><HI>Don Pelayo</HI> enjoy'd for his life the Kingdom confer'd upon him by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who with him retir'd into the Mountains to defend themselves against the <HI>Moors,</HI> and was succeeded by his Son <HI>Favila.</HI> But tho <HI>Favila</HI> left many Sons when he dy'd, <HI>Alphonso</HI> sirnam'd the Chast was advanc'd to the Crown, and they all laid aside. <HI>Fruela</HI> Son to <HI>Alphonso</HI> the Catho∣lick, was for his cruelty depos'd, put to death, and his Sons excluded. <HI>Aurelio</HI> his Cousin German succeeded him; and at his death <HI>Silo,</HI> who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mariana l. 13.</NOTE>marry'd his Wife's Sister, was prefer'd before the Males of the Blood Royal. <HI>Alphonso,</HI> sirnam'd <HI>El Casto,</HI> was first violently dispossest of the Crown by a Bastard of the Royal Family; but he being dead, the No∣bility and People thinking <HI>Alphonso</HI> more fit to be a Monk than a King, gave the Crown to <HI>Bermudo</HI> call'd <HI>El Diacono;</HI> but <HI>Bermudo</HI> after several years resigning the Kingdom, they conceiv'd a better opinion of <HI>Alphonso,</HI> and made him King. <HI>Alphonso</HI> dying without issue, <HI>Don Ramiro</HI> Son to <HI>Bermudo</HI> was prefer'd before the Nephews of <HI>Alphonso.

 seems to have bin a very good Prince; but applying himself more to the study of Astrology than to affairs of Government (his eldest Son <HI>Ferdi∣nand de la Cerda</HI> dying, and leaving his Sons <HI>Alphonso</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> very young) the Nobility, Clergy and People depos'd him, excluded his Granchildren, and gave the Crown to <HI>Don Sancho</HI> his younger Son, sir∣nam'd <HI>El Bravo,</HI> thinking him more fit to command them against the <HI>Moors,</HI> than an old Astrologer, or a Child. <HI>Alphonso</HI> and <HI>Sancho</HI> being dead, <HI>Alphonso el Desheredado</HI> laid claim to the Crown, but it was given to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Fourth, and <HI>Alphonso</HI> with his descendents the Dukes <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> remain excluded to this day. <HI>Peter</HI> sirnam'd the Cruel was twice driven out of the Kingdom, and at last kill'd by <HI>Bertrand de Guesclin</HI> Constable of <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Henry</HI> Count of <HI>Trastamara</HI> his Bastard-Brother, who was made King without any regard to the Daughters of <HI>Peter,</HI> or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Marian. l. 24.</NOTE>to the House of <HI>La Cerda. Henry</HI> the Fourth left a Daughter call'd <HI>Joan,</HI> whom he declar'd his Heir; but the Estates gave the Kingdom to <HI>Isabel</HI> his Sister, and crown'd her with <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Arragon</HI> her Husband. <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter to this <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabel</HI> falling mad, the Estates com∣mitted the care of the Governnent to her Father <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and after his death to her Son.</P>
<P>But the <HI>French</HI> have taught us, that when a King dies, his next Heir is really King before he take his Oath, or be crown'd. From them we learn that <HI>Le mort saisit le vif.</HI> And yet I know no History that proves more plainly than theirs, that there neither is nor can be in any man, a right to the Government of a People, which dos not receive its being, manner and measure from the Law of the Country; which I hope to justify by four Reasons.</P>
<P>1. When a King of <HI>Pharamond</HI>'s Race dy'd, the Kingdom was divid∣ed into as many parcels as he had Sons; which could not have bin, if one certain Heir had bin assign'd by nature, for he ought to have had the whole: and if the Kingdom might be divided, they who inhabited the several parcels, could not know to whom they ow'd obedience, till the division was made, unless he who was to be King of <HI>Paris, Metz, Sois∣sons</HI> or <HI>Orleans,</HI> had worn the Name of his Kingdom upon his forehead. But in truth, if there might be a division, the Doctrin is false, and there was no Lord of the whole. This wound will not be heal'd, by saying, The Father appointed the division, and that by the Law of nature every man may dispose of his own as he thinks fit; for we shall soon prove that the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> neither was, nor is disposable as a Patrimo∣ny or Chattel. Besides, if that Act of Kings had bin then grounded upon the Law of nature, they might do the like at this day. But the Law, by which such Divisions were made, having bin abrogated by the Assem∣bly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. de Fr. en la Vie de Hu∣gues Capet.</NOTE>of Estates in the time of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> and never practis'd since, it follows that they were grounded upon a temporary Law, and not upon the Law of Nature which is eternal. If this were not so, the pretended certainty could not be; for no man could know to whom the last King had bequeath'd the whole Kingdom, or parcels of it, till the Will were open'd; and that must be done before such Witnesses as may deserve cre∣dit in a matter of this importance, and are able to judg whether the Be∣quest be rightly made; for otherwise no man could know, whether the Kingdom was to have one Lord or many, nor who he or they were to be; which intermission must necessarily subvert their Polity, and this Doctrin. But the truth is, the most Monarchical men among them are so far from acknowledging any such right to be in the King, of alienating, bequeath∣ing
<PB N="307" REF="315"/>
or dividing the Kingdom, that they do not allow him the right of making a Will; and that of the last King <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th</HI> touching the Regency during the minority of his Son was of no effect. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mem. du Duc. de la Rochefo∣cault.</NOTE></P>
<P>2. This matter was made more clear under the second race. If a Lord had bin assign'd to them by nature, he must have bin of the Royal Family: But <HI>Pepin</HI> had no other Title to the Crown, except the merits of his Father, and his own, approv'd by the Nobility and People who made him King. He had three sons, the eldest was made King of <HI>Italy,</HI> and dying before him left a Son call'd <HI>Bernard</HI> Heir of that Kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul. Aemil. Hist. Franc▪</NOTE>The Estates of <HI>France</HI> divided what remain'd between <HI>Charles</HI> the Great and <HI>Carloman,</HI> The last of these dying in a few years, left many Sons, but the Nobility made <HI>Charles</HI> King of all <HI>France,</HI> and he dispossest <HI>Ber∣nard</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Italy</HI> inherited from his Father: so that he also was not King of the whole, before the expulsion of <HI>Bernard</HI> the Son of his elder Brother; nor of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> which by inheritance should have belong'd to the Children of his younger Brother, any otherwise than by the will of the Estates. <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Debonair</HI> succeeded upon the same title, was depos'd and put into a Monastery by his three Sons <HI>Lothair, Pepin</HI> and <HI>Lewis,</HI> whom he had by his first Wife. But tho these left many Sons, the Kingdom came to <HI>Charles</HI> the Bald. The Nobility and People disliking the eldest Son of <HI>Charles,</HI> gave the Kingdom to <HI>Lewis le Begue,</HI> who had a legitimate Son called <HI>Charles le Simple;</HI> but his two Bastards, <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Carloman,</HI> were made Kings. <HI>Carloman</HI> had a Son call'd <HI>Lewis le faineant;</HI> he was made King, but afterwards depos'd for his vi∣cious Life. <HI>Charles le Gross</HI> succeeded him, but for his ill Govern∣ment was also depos'd; and <HI>Odo,</HI> who was a stranger to the Royal Blood, was made King. The same Nobility that had made five Kings since <HI>Lewis le Begue,</HI> now made <HI>Charles le Simple</HI> King, who according to his name was entrap'd at <HI>Peronne</HI> by <HI>Ralph</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and forc'd to resign his Crown, leaving only a Son call'd <HI>Lewis,</HI> who fled into <HI>England. Ralph</HI> being dead, they took <HI>Lewis</HI> sirnam'd <HI>Outremer,</HI> and plac'd him in the Throne: he had two Sons, <HI>Lothair</HI> and <HI>Charles. Lothair</HI> succeeded him, and dy'd without Issue. <HI>Charles</HI> had as fair a title as could be by Birth, and the Estates confest it; but their Embassadors told him, that he having by an unworthy Life render'd himself unworthy of the Crown, they, whose principal care was to have a good Prince at the head of them, had chosen <HI>Hugh Capet;</HI> and the Crown continues in his race to this day, tho not altogether without interruption. <HI>Robert</HI> Son to <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> succeeded him. He left two Sons <HI>Robert</HI> and <HI>Henry;</HI> but <HI>Henry</HI> the younger Son appearing to the Estates of the Kingdom to be more fit to reign than his elder Brother, they made him King, <HI>Robert</HI> and his descen∣dents continuing Dukes of <HI>Burgundy</HI> only for about ten Generations; at which time his Issue Male failing, that Dutchy return'd to the Crown during the Life of King <HI>John,</HI> who gave it to his second Son <HI>Philip</HI> for an <HI>Apannage</HI> still depending upon the Crown. The same Province of <HI>Burgundy</HI> was by the Treaty of <HI>Madrid</HI> granted to the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the sisth by <HI>Francis</HI> the first: but the People refus'd to be alienated, and the Estates of the Kingdom approv'd their refusal. By the same Authority <HI>Charles</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> was remov'd from the Government, when he appear'd to be mad; and other examples of a like nature may be alledg'd. From which we may safely conclude, that if the death of one King dos really invest the next Heir with the Right and Power, or that he who is so invested, be subject to no Law but his own Will, all matters relating
<PB N="308" REF="316"/>
 to that Kingdom must have bin horribly confus'd during the reigns of twen∣ty two Kings of <HI>Pharamond</HI>'s race; they can have had no rightful King from the death of <HI>Chilperic</HI> to King <HI>John:</HI> and the Succession since that time is very liable to be question'd, if not utterly overthrown by the house of <HI>Austria,</HI> who by the Counts of <HI>Hapsburg</HI> derive their Descent from <HI>Pharamond,</HI> and by the house of <HI>Lorrain</HI> claiming from <HI>Charles,</HI> who was excluded by <HI>Capet:</HI> All which is most absurd, and they who pretend it, bring as much confusion into their own Laws, and upon the Polity of their own Nation, as shame and guilt upon the memory of their Ancestors, who by the most extreme injustice have rejected their natural Lord, or dispossest those who had bin in the most solemn manner plac'd in the Government, and to whom they had generally sworn Allegiance.</P>
<P>3. If the next Heir be actually King, seiz'd of the power by the death of his Predecessor, so that there is no intermission; then all the Solem∣nitys and religious Ceremonys us'd at the Coronations of their Kings, with the Oaths given and taken, are the most profane abuses of sacred things in contempt of God and Man that can be imagin'd, most especially if the Act be (as our Author calls it) voluntary, and the King receiving nothing by it, be bound to keep it no longer than he pleases. The Prince who is to be sworn, might spare the pains of watching all night in the Church, fasting, praying, confessing, communicating, and swearing, <HI>that he will to the utmost of his power defend the Clergy, maintain the union of the Church, obviate all excess, rapine, extortion and iniquity; take care that in all judgments Justice may be observ'd, with Equity and Mercy, &amp;c. or of invoking the assistance of the Holy Ghost for the better performance of his Oath;</HI> and without ceremony tell the Nobility and People, that he would do what he thought fit. 'Twere to as little purpose for the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Rheims</HI> to take the trouble of saying Mass, delivering to him the Crown, Scepter, and other ensigns of Royalty, explaining what is signify'd by them, anointing him with the Oil which they say was de∣liver'd by an Angel to St. <HI>Remigius,</HI> blessing him, and praying to God to bless him if he rightly perform'd his Oath to God and the People, and de∣nouncing the contrary in case of failure on his part, if these things con∣fer'd nothing upon him but what he had before, and were of no obliga∣tion to him. Such ludifications of the most sacred things are too odious and impious to be imputed to Nations that have any vertue, or profess Christianity. This cannot fall upon the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had certainly a great zeal to Religion, whatever it was; and were so eminent sor moral Vertues as to be a reproach to us, who live in an Age of more Knowledg. But their meaning is so well declar'd by their most solemn Acts, that none but those who are wilfully ignorant can mistake. One of the Councils held at <HI>Toledo,</HI> declar'd by the Clergy, Nobility, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</NOTE>others assisting, <HI>That no man should be plac'd in the Royal Seat till he had sworn to preserve the Church,</HI> &amp;c. Another held in the same place, signi∣fy'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. 4.</NOTE>to <HI>Sisinandus,</HI> who was then newly crown'd, <HI>That if he, or any of his Successors should, contrary to their Oaths, and the Laws of their Country, proudly and cruelly presume to exercise Domination over them, he should be excommunicated, and separated from Christ and them to eternal judgment.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Laws, and their best Writers asserting the same things, are confirm'd by perpetual practice. <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Navarre,</HI> tho certainly ac∣cording to their Rules, and in their esteem a most accomplish'd Prince, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</NOTE>was by two General Assemblys of the Estates held at <HI>Blois,</HI> depriv'd of the Succession for being a Protestant; and notwithstanding the greatness
<PB N="309" REF="317"/>
of his Reputation, Valor, Victorys, and Affability, could never be admit∣ted, till he had made himself capable of the ceremonys of his Coronation, by conforming to the Religion which by the Oath he was to defend. Nay this present King, tho haughty enough by nature, and elevated by many successes, has acknowledg'd, as he says, with joy, that he can do nothing contrary to Law, and calls it a happy impotence; in pursuance of which he has annul'd many Acts of his Father and Grandfather, alie∣nating the demeasnes of the Crown, as things contrary to Law, and not within their power.</P>
<P>These things being confirm'd by all the good Authors of that Nation, <HI>Filmer</HI> finds only the worst to be fit for his turn; and neither minding Law nor History, takes his Maxims from a vile flattering discourse of <HI>Bellay,</HI> calculated for the personal Interest of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth then King of <HI>Navarr,</HI> in which he says, <HI>That the Heir apparent, tho furious, mad,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Apol. Cathol.</NOTE><HI>a fool, vicious, and in all respects abominably wicked, must be admitted to the Crown.</HI> But <HI>Bellay</HI> was so far from attaining the ends design'd by his Book, that by such Doctrins, which fill'd all men with horror, he brought great prejudice to his Master, and procur'd little favor from <HI>Henry,</HI> who desir'd rather to recommend himself to his People as the best man they could set up, than to impose a necessity upon 'em of taking him if he had bin the worst. But our Author, not contented with what this Sycophant says, in relation to such Princes as are plac'd in the Govern∣ment by a Law establishing the Succession by inheritance, with an impu∣dence peculiar to himself, asserts the same right to be in any man, who by any means gets into Power; and imposes the same necessity of obedi∣ence upon the Subject where there is no Law, as <HI>Bellay</HI> dos by virtue of one that is establish'd.</P>
<P>4. In the last place: As <HI>Bellay</HI> acknowledges that the right belongs to Princes only where 'tis establish'd by Law, I deny that there is, was, or ever can be any such. No People is known to have bin so mad or wicked, as by their own consent, for their own good, and for the obtaining of Jus∣tice, to give the power to Beasts, under whom it could never be ob∣tain'd: or if we could believe that any had bin guilty of an act so full of folly, turpitude and wickedness, it could not have the force of a Law, and could never be put in execution; for tho the rules, by which the proximity should be judg'd, be never so precise, it will still be doubted whose case sutes best with them. Tho the Law in some places gives pri∣vate Inheritances to the next Heir, and in others makes allotments accord∣ing to several proportions, no one knows to whom, or how far the benefit shall accrue to any man, till it be adjudg'd by a Power to which the par∣tys must submit. Contests will in the like manner arise concerning suc∣cessions to Crowns, how exactly soever they be dispos'd by Law: For tho every one will say that the next ought to succeed, yet no man knows who is the next; which is too much verify'd by the bloody decisions of such disputes in many parts of the world: and he that says the next in blood is actually King, makes all questions thereupon arising impossible to be otherwise determin'd than by the Sword; the pretender to the right being plac'd above the judgment of man, and the Subjects (for any thing I know) oblig'd to believe, serve and obey him, if he says he has it. For otherwise, if either every man in particular, or all together have a right of judging his title, it can be of no value till it be adjudg'd.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="318"/>
 I confess that the Law of <HI>France,</HI> by the utter exclusion of Females and their descendents, dos obviate many dangerous and inextricable difficul∣tys; but others remain which are sufficient to subvert all the Polity of that Kingdom, if there be not a power of judging them; and there can be none if it be true that <HI>Le mort saisit le vif.</HI> Not to trouble my self with feign'd cases, that of Legitimation alone will suffice. 'Tis not e∣nough to say that the Children born under marriage are to be reputed le∣gitimate; for not only several Children born of <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> Wife to <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth of <HI>Castille,</HI> during the time of their Marriage, were utterly rejected as begotten in Adultery, but also her Daughter <HI>Joan,</HI> whom the King during his life, and at the hour of his death acknowledg'd to have bin begotten by him; and the only Title that <HI>Isabel,</HI> who was marry'd to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> had to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> was deriv'd from their rejection. It would be tedious, and might give offence to many great Persons, if I should relate all the dubious cases, that have bin, or still remain in the World, touching mat∣ters of this nature: but the Lawyers of all Nations will testify, that hardly any one point comes before them, which affords a greater number of difficult Cases, than that of Marriages, and the Legitimation of Chil∣dren upon them; and Nations must be involv'd in the most inextricable difficultys, if there be not a power somewhere to decide them; which cannot be, if there be no intermission, and that the next in blood (that is, he who says he is the next) be immediately invested with the right and power. But surely no people has bin so careless of their most important Concernments, to leave them in such uncertainty, and simply to depend upon the humor of a man, or the faith of women, who besides their other Frailtys, have bin often accus'd of supposititious Births: and mens passions are known to be so violent in relation to Women they love or hate, that none can safely be trusted with those Judgments. The vertue of the best would be expos'd to a temptation, that flesh and blood can hardly resist; and such as are less perfect would follow no other rule than the blind impulse of the passion that for the present reigns in them. There must therefore be a judg of such disputes as may in these cases arise in every Kingdom; and tho 'tis not my business to determin who is that judg in all places, yet I may justly say, that in <HI>England</HI> it is the Parlia∣ment. If no inferior Authority could debar <HI>Ignotus</HI> Son to the Lady <HI>Rosse,</HI> born under the Protection, from the inheritance of a private Fami∣ly, none can certainly assume a power of disposing of the Crown upon any occasion. No Authority but that of the Parliament could legitimate the Children of <HI>Catherine Swinford,</HI> with a proviso, not to extend to the inheritance of the Crown. Others might say, if they were lawfully begotten, they ought to inherit every thing, and nothing if they were not: But the Parliament knew how to limit a particular favor, and pre∣vent it from extending to a publick mischief. <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth took an expeditious way of obviating part of the Controversys that might arise from the multitude of his Wives, by cutting off the heads of some, as soon as he was weary of them, or had a mind to take another; but hav∣ing bin hinder'd from dealing in the same manner with <HI>Catherine</HI> by the greatness of her birth and kindred, he left such as the Parliament only could resolve. And no less power would ever have thought of making <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> capable of the succession, when, according to ordi∣nary rules, one of 'em must have bin a Bastard; and it had bin absurd to say, that both of 'em were immediately upon the death of their Prede∣cessors

 himself any other Wise, Children or Goods, than he can procure by his own Sword.</P>
<P>Some may perhaps think that the endeavours of our Author to intro∣duce such accursed Principles as tend to the ruin of Mankind, proceed from his ignorance. But tho he appears to have had a great measure of that quality, I fear the evil proceeds from a deeper root; and that he at∣tempts to promote the interests of ill Magistrats, who make it their busi∣ness to destroy all good principles in the People, with as much industry as the good endeavour to preserve them where they are, and teach them where they are wanting. Reason and Experience instruct us, that every man acts according to the end he proposes to himself. The good Magi∣strate seeks the good of the People committed to his care, that he may perform the end of his Institution: and knowing that chiefly to consist in Justice and Vertue, he endeavours to plant and propagate them; and by doing this he procures his own good, as well as that of the Publick. He knows there is no Safety where there is no Strength, no Strength without Union, no Union without Justice; no Justice where Faith and Truth, in accomplishing publick and private Contracts, is wanting. This he perpetually inculcates, and thinks it a great part of his duty, by precept and example, to educate the Youth in a love of Vertue and Truth, that they may be season'd with them, and fill'd with an abhor∣rence of Vice and Falshood, before they attain that Age which is expos'd to the most violent temptations, and in which they may by their crimes bring the greatest mischiefs upon the publick. He would do all this, tho it were to his own prejudice. But as good Actions always carry a re∣ward with them, these contribute in a high measure to his advantage. By preferring the interest of the People before his own, he gains their affection, and all that is in their power comes with it; whilst he unites them to one another, he unites all to himself: In leading them to vertue, he increases their strength, and by that means provides for his own safety, glory and power.</P>
<P>On the other side, such as seek different ends must take different ways. When a Magistrate fancys he is not made for the People, but the Peo∣ple for him; that he dos not govern for them, but for himself; and that the People live only to increase his glory, or to furnish matter for his pleasures, he dos not inquire what he may do for them, but what he may draw from them. By this means he sets up an interest of profit, pleasure or pomp in himself, repugnant to the good of the publick for which he is made to be what he is. These contrary ends certainly divide the Nation into partys; and whilst every one endeavours to advance that to which he is addicted, occasions of hatred for injurys every day done, or thought to be done and receiv'd, must necessarily arise. This creates a most fierce and irreconcilable enmity, because the occasions are frequent, important and universal, and the causes thought to be most just. The People think it the greatest of all crimes, to convert that power to their hurt, which was instituted for their good; and that the injustice is ag∣gravated by perjury and ingratitude, which comprehend all manner of ill; and the Magistrate gives the name of Sedition or Rebellion to what∣soever they do for the preservation of themselves and their own Rights. When mens Spirits are thus prepar'd, a small matter sets them on fire; but if no accident happen to blow them into a flame, the course of Justice is certainly interrupted, the publick affairs are neglected; and when any occasion whether foreign or domestick arises, in which the Magistrate
<PB N="313" REF="321"/>
stands in need of the Peoples assistance, they, whose affections are alie∣nated, not only shew an unwillingness to serve him with their Persons and Estates, but fear that by delivering him from his distress they streng∣then their enemy, and enable him to oppress them: and he fancying his will to be unjustly oppos'd, or his due more unjustly deny'd, is fill'd with a dislike of what he sees, and a fear of worse for the future. Whilst he endeavours to ease himself of the one, and to provide against the other, he usually increases the evils of both, and jealousys are on both sides mul∣tiply'd. Every man knows that the Governed are in a great measure un∣der the power of the Governor; but as no man, or number of men, is willingly subject to those who seek their ruin, such as fall into so great a misfortune, continue no longer under it than force, fear, or necessity may be able to oblige them. But as such a necessity can hardly lie longer upon a great People, than till the evil be fully discover'd and comprehended, and their Vertue, Strength and Power be united to expel it; the ill Magi∣strate looks upon all things that may conduce to that end, as so many pre∣paratives to his ruin; and by the help of those who are of his party, will endeavour to prevent that Union, and diminish that Strength, Ver∣tue, Power and Courage, which he knows to be bent against him. And as truth, faithful dealing, due performance of Contracts, and integrity of Manners, are bonds of Union, and helps to good, he will always by tricks, artifices, cavils, and all means possible endeavour to establish falshood and dishonesty; whilst other Emissarys and instruments of Ini∣quity, by corrupting the Youth, and seducing such as can be brought to leudness and debauchery, bring the People to such a pass, that they may neither care nor dare to vindicate their Rights, and that those who would do it, may so far suspect each other, as not to confer upon, much less to join in any action tending to the publick Deliverance.</P>
<P>This distinguishes the good from the bad Magistrate, the faithful from the unfaithful; and those who adhere to either, living in the same prin∣ciple, must walk in the same ways. They who uphold the rightful power of a just Magistracy, encourage Vertue and Justice, and teach men what they ought to do, suffer, or expect from others; they fix them upon principles of Honesty, and generally advance every thing that tends to the increase of the valor, strength, greatness and happiness of the Nation, creating a good Union among them, and bringing every man to an exact understanding of his own and the publick Rights. On the other side, he that would introduce an ill Magistrate; make one evil who was good, or preserve him in the exercise of injustice when he is corrup∣ted, must always open the way for him by vitiating the People, corrupting their Manners, destroying the validity of Oaths and Contracts, teaching such evasions, equivocations and frauds, as are inconsistent with the thoughts that become men of vertue and courage; and overthrowing the confidence they ought to have in each other, make it impossible for them to unite among themselves. The like Arts must be us'd with the Magistrate: He cannot be for their turn, till he is persuaded to believe he has no dependence upon, and ows no duty to the People; that he is of himself, and not by their Institution; that no man ought to inquire into, nor be judg of his actions; that all obedience is due to him, whether he be good or bad, wise or foolish, a father or an enemy to his Country. This being calculated for his personal interest, he must pursue the same designs, or his Kingdom is divided within it self, and cannot subsist. By this means those who flatter his humor, come to be accounted his
<PB N="314" REF="322"/>
 Friends, and the only men that are thought worthy of great Trusts, whilst such as are of another mind are expos'd to all persecution. These are always such as excel in Vertue, Wisdom, and greatness of Spirit: they have Eyes, and they will always see the way they go; and leaving fools to be guided by implicit Faith, will distinguish between good and evil, and chuse that which is best; they will judg of men by their acti∣ons, and by them discovering whose Servant every man is, know whe∣ther he is to be obey'd or not. Those who are ignorant of all good, care∣less, or enemys to it, take a more compendious way: their slavish, vi∣tious and base natures inclining them to seek only private and present ad∣vantages, they easily slide into a blind dependence upon one who has Wealth and Power; and desiring only to know his will, care not what injustice they do, if they may be rewarded. They worship what they find in the Temple, tho it be the vilest of Idols, and always like that best which is worst, because it agrees with their inclinations and prin∣ciples. When a party comes to be erected on such a foundation, debau∣chery, leudness and dishonesty are the true badges of it. Such as wear them are cherish'd; but the principal marks of favor are reserv'd for those who are the most industrious in mischief, either by seducing the People with the allurements of sensual Pleasures, or corrupting their Understandings by false and slavish Doctrins. By this means a man who calls himself a Philosopher or a Divine, is often more useful than a great number of Tapsters, Cooks, Buffoons, Players, Fidlers, Whores or Bauds. These are the Devil's Ministers of a lower Order; they seduce single Persons, and such as fall into their snares are for the most part men of the simpler sort: but the principal supporters of his Kingdom, are they, who by false Doctrins poison the springs of Religion and Vertue, and by preaching or writing (if their falshood and wickedness were not detected) would extinguish all principles of common honesty, and bring whole Nations to be best satisfy'd with themselves, when their actions are most abominable. And as the means must always be sutable to the end propos'd, the Governments that are to be establish'd or supported by such ways must needs be the worst of all, and comprehend all manner of evil.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XX. Unjust Commands are not to be obey'd; and no man is oblig'd to suffer for not obeying such as are against Law.</HEAD>
<P>IN the next place our Author gravely proposes a question, <HI>Whether it be a sin to disobey the King, if he command any thing contrary to Law?</HI> and as gravely determins, <HI>that not only in human Laws, but even in Divine, a thing may be commanded contrary to Law, and yet obedience to such a Com∣mand is necessary. The sanctifying of the Sabbath is a divine Law, yet if a Master command his Servant not to go to Church upon a Sabbath-day, the best Divines teach us, the Servant must obey, &amp;c. It is not sit to ty the Master to acquaint the Servant with his secret Counsel.</HI> Tho he frequently contradicts in one line what he says in another, this whole Clause is uniform and sutable to the main design of his Book. He sets up the au∣thority
<PB N="315" REF="323"/>
of Man in opposition to the command of God, gives it the pre∣ference, and says, the best Divines instruct us so to do. St. <HI>Paul</HI> then must have bin one of the worst, for he knew that the Powers under which he liv'd, had under the severest penaltys forbidden the publication of the Gospel; and yet he says, <HI>Wo to me if I preach it not.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> was no better than he, for he tells us, <HI>That it is better to obey God than Man:</HI> and they could not speak otherwise, unless they had forgotten the words of their Master, who told them, <HI>They should not fear them that could on∣ly kill the Body, but him who could kill and cast into Hell.</HI> And if I must not fear him that can only kill the Body, not only the reason, but all ex∣cuse for obeying him is taken away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 14▪</NOTE> To prove what he says, he cites a pertinent Example from St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and very logically concludes, that because Christ approv'd the hypocrisy of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> (who generally adher'd to the external and circumstantial part of the Law, neglecting the essential, and taking upon themselves to be the interpreters of that which they did not understand) the Law of God is not to be obey'd: and as strongly proves, that because Christ shew'd them that the same Law, which by their own confession permit∣ted them to pull an Ass out of a pit on the Sabbath-day, could not but give a liberty of healing the sick, therefore the commands of Kings are to be obey'd, tho they should be contrary to human and divine Laws. But if perverseness had not blinded him, he might have seen, that this very Text is wholly against his purpose; for the Magistratical Power was on the side of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> otherwise they would not have sought an occasion to ensnare him; and that power having perverted the Law of God by false glosses, and a superinduction of human Traditions, pro∣hibited the most necessary acts of Charity to be done on the Sabbath∣day, which Christ reprov'd, and restor'd the sick man to his health in their sight.</P>
<P>But I could wish our Author had told us the names of those Divines, who, he says, are the best, and who pretend to teach us these fine things. I know some who are thought good, that are of a contrary opinion, and say, that God having requir'd that Day to be set apart for his Service and Worship, man cannot dispense with the Obligation, unless he can abro∣gate the Law of God. Perhaps, for want of other Arguments to prove the contrary, I may be told, that this savours too much of Puritanism and Calvinism. But I shall take the reproach, till some better Patrons than <HI>Laud</HI> and his creatures may be found for the other opinion. By the advice and instigation of these men, from about the year 1630, to 1640, sports and revelings, which ended for the most part in drunkenness and leudness, were not only permitted on that day, but enjoin'd. And tho this did advance human Authority in derogation to the Divine, to a de∣gree that may please such as are of our Author's mind, yet others resolv∣ing rather to obey the Laws of God than the Commands of Men, could not be brought to pass the Lord's day in that manner. Since that time no man except <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin</HI> have bin so wicked to conceive, or so impudent to assert such brutal absurditys. But leaving the farther con∣sideration of the original of this abuse, I desire to know, whether the Authority given to Masters to command things contrary to the Law of God, be peculiar in relation to the Sabbath, or to a few other points, or ought generally to extend to all God's Laws; and whether he who may command his Servant to act contrary to the Law of God, have not a right in himself of doing the same. If peculiar, some Authority or Pre∣cept
<PB N="316" REF="324"/>
 must be produc'd, by which it may appear that God has slighted his Ordinance concerning that Day, and suffer'd it to be contemn'd, whilst he exacts obedience to all others. If we have a liberty left to us of slight∣ing others also, more or less in number, we ought to know how many, what they are, and how it comes to pass, that some are of obligation and others not. If the Empire of the world is not only divided between God and <HI>Cesar,</HI> but every man also who can give five pounds a year to a Servant, has so great a part in it, that in some cases his commands are to be obey'd preferably to those of God, it were fit to know the limits of each Kingdom, lest we happen preposterously to obey man when we ought to obey God, or God when we are to follow the commands of men. If it be general, the Law of God is of no effect, and we may safely put an end to all thoughts and discourses of Religion: the word of God is nothing to us; we are not to inquire what he has commanded, but what pleases our Master, how insolent, foolish, vile or wicked so∣ever he may be. The Apostles and Prophets who dy'd for preferring the commands of God before those of men, fell like fools, and perish'd in their sins. But if every particular man that has a servant, can exempt him from the commands of God, he may also exempt himself, and the Laws of God are at once abrogated throout the world.</P>
<P>'Tis a folly to say there is a passive, as well as an active Obedience, and that he who will not do what his Master commands ought to suffer the punishment he inflicts: for if the Master has a right of commanding, there is a duty incumbent on the servant of obeying. He that suffers for not doing that which he ought to do, draws upon himself both the guilt and the punishment. But no one can be oblig'd to suffer for that which he ought not to do, because he who pretends to command, has not so far an Authority. However, our question is, whether the Servant should forbear to do that which God commands, rather than whether the Master should put away or beat him if he do not: for if the Servant ought to obey his Master rather than God, as our Author says the best Divines assert, he sins in disobeying, and that guilt cannot be expiated by his suf∣fering. If it be thought I carry this point to an undue extremity, the limits ought to be demonstrated, by which it may appear that I exceed them, tho the nature of the case cannot be alter'd: for if the Law of God may not be abrogated by the commands of men, a Servant cannot be exempted from keeping the Sabbath according to the Ordinance of God, at the will of his Master. But if a power be given to man at his pleasure to annul the Laws of God, the Apostles ought not to have preach'd, when they were forbidden by the Powers to which they were subject: The tortures and deaths they suffer'd for not obeying that com∣mand were in their own wrong, and their blood was upon their own heads.</P>
<P>His second instance concerning Wars, in which he says the Subject is not to examin whether they are just or unjust, but must obey, is weak and frivolous, and very often false; whereas consequences can rightly be drawn from such things only as are certainly and universally true. Tho God may be merciful to a Soldier, who by the wickedness of a Magi∣strate whom he honestly trusts, is made a Minister of injustice, 'tis nothing to this case. For if our Author say true, that the word of a King can justify him in going against the command of God, he must do what is commanded tho he think it evil: The Christian Soldiers under the Pagan Emperors were oblig'd to destroy their Brethren, and the best
<PB N="317" REF="325"/>
men in the world for being so: Such as now live under the <HI>Turk</HI> have the same obligation upon them of defending their Master, and slaughtering those he reputes his Enemys for adhering to Christianity: And the King of <HI>France</HI> may when he pleases, arm one part of his Protestant Subjects to the destruction of the other; which is a godly doctrin, and worthy our Author's invention.</P>
<P>But if this be so, I know not how the <HI>Israelites</HI> can be said to have sinn'd in following the examples of <HI>Jeroboam, Omri, Ahab,</HI> or other wicked Kings: they could not have sinn'd in obeying, if it had bin a sin to disobey their commands; and God would not have punish'd them so severely, if they had not sinn'd. 'Tis impertinent to say they were oblig'd to serve their Kings in unjust Wars, but not to serve Idols; for tho God be jealous of his glory, yet he forbids Rapine and Murder as well as Idolatry. If there be a Law that forbids the Subject to examin the com∣mands tending to the one, it cannot but enjoin obedience to the other. The same Authority which justifys Murder, takes away the guilt of Idolatry; and the Wretches, both Judges and Witnesses, who put <HI>Naboth</HI> to death, could as little alledg ignorance, as those that worship'd <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s Calves; the same light of Nature by which they should have known, that a ridi∣culous Image was not to be ador'd as God, instructing them also, that an innocent man ought not under pretence of Law to be murder'd by per∣jury.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXI. It cannot be for the good of the People that the Magistrate have a power above the Law: and he is not a Magistrate who has not his power by Law.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we may not be displeas'd, or think it dangerous and slavish to depend upon the will of a man, which perhaps may be irregu∣lar or extravagant in one who is subject to no Law, our Author very dex∣trously removes the scruples by telling us,</P>
<P><HI>1.</HI> That the Prerogative of the King to be above the Law, is only for the good of them that are under the Law, and to preserve their Libertys.</P>
<P>2. <HI>That there can be no Laws without a supreme Power to command or make them: In Aristocracys the Noblemen are above the Law; in Democra∣cys the People: By the like reason in a Monarchy, the King must of necessity be above the Law. There can be no Sovereign Majesty in him that is under the Law: that which gives the very being to a King, is the power to give Laws. Without this Power he is but an equivocal King. It skills not how he comes by this Power, whether by Election, Donation, Succession, or any other means.</HI> I am contented in some degree to follow our Author, and to acknowledg that the King neither has nor can have any Prerogative which is not for the good of the People, and the preservation of their Libertys. This therefore is the foundation of Magistratical Power, and the only way of discerning whether the Prerogative of making Laws, of being above Laws, or any other he may pretend, be justly due to him or not: and if it be doubted who is the fittest judg to determin that question, com∣mon sense will inform us, that if the Magistrate receive his Power by election or donation, they who elect, or give him that Power, best
<PB N="318" REF="326"/>
 know whether the good they sought be perform'd or not; if by succes∣sion, they who instituted the Succession: if otherwise, that is, by fraud or violence, the point is decided, for he has no right at all, and none can be created by those means. This might be said, tho all Princes were of ripe age, sober, wise, just and good; for even the best are subject to mistakes and passions, and therefore unfit to be judges of their own con∣cernments, in which they may by various means be misguided: but it would be extreme madness to attribute the same to Children, Fools, or Madmen, who are not able to judg of the least things concerning them∣selves or others; but most especially to those, who coming in by usurpa∣tion, declare their contempt of all human and divine Laws, and are ene∣mys to the People they oppress. None therefore can be judges of such cases but the People, for whom and by whom the Constitutions are made; or their Representatives and Delegats, to whom they give the power of doing it.</P>
<P>But nothing can be more absurd than to say, that one man has an abso∣lute power above Law to govern according to his will, <HI>for the Peoples good, and the preservation of their Liberty:</HI> For no Liberty can subsist where there is such a Power; and we have no other way of distinguish∣ing between free Nations and such as are not so, than that the free are govern'd by their own Laws and Magistrats according to their own mind, and that the others either have willingly subjected themselves, or are by force brought under the power of one or more men, to be rul'd accord∣ing to his or their pleasure. The same distinction holds in relation to particular persons. He is a free man who lives as best pleases himself, under Laws made by his own consent; and the name of slave can belong to no man, unless to him who is either born in the house of a Master, bought, taken, subdu'd, or willingly gives his ear to be nail'd to the post, and subjects himself to the will of another. Thus were the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI> said to be free in opposition to the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> as <HI>Artabanus</HI> acknowledg'd in his Discourse to <HI>Themistocles.</HI> In the same manner the <HI>Italians, Germans</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> were distinguish'd from the Eastern Na∣tions. who for the most part were under the power of Tyrants. <HI>Rome</HI> was said to have recover'd liberty by the expulsion of the <HI>Tarquins;</HI> or, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> expresses it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Libertatem &amp; Consulatum L. Brutus instituit. <BIBL>An. l. <HI>1.</HI></BIBL></NOTE><HI>Lucius Brutus establish'd Liberty and the Consulat together,</HI> as if before that time they had never enjoy'd any; and <HI>Julius Cesar</HI> is said to have overthrown the liberty of that People. But if <HI>Filmer</HI> deserve credit, the <HI>Romans</HI> were free under <HI>Tarquin,</HI> enslav'd when he was driven way, and his Prerogative extinguish'd, that was so necessarily requir'd for the defence of their Liberty; and were never restor'd to it, till <HI>Cesar</HI> assum'd all the Power to himself. By the same rule the <HI>Switzers, Grisons, Venetians, Hollanders,</HI> and some other Nations are now Slaves; and <HI>Tuscany,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Ecclesiastical State, with such as live under a more gentle Master on the other side of the Water, I mean the <HI>Turk,</HI> are free Nations. Nay the <HI>Florentins,</HI> who complain of Sla∣very under the House of <HI>Medices,</HI> were made free by the power of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Army who set up a Prerogative in that gentle Family, which for their good has destroy'd all that could justly be call'd so in that Coun∣try, and almost wholly dispeopl'd it. I, who esteem my self free, be∣cause I depend upon the will of no man, and hope to die in the liberty I inherit from my Ancestors, am a slave; and the <HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Turks,</HI> who
<PB N="319" REF="327"/>
may be beaten and kill'd whenever it pleases their insolent Masters, are Free-men. But surely the world is not so much mistaken in the signifi∣cation of words and things. The weight of Chains, number of Stripes, hardness of labor, and other effects of a Master's cruelty, may make one servitude more miserable than another: but he is a slave who serves the best and gentlest man in the world, as well as he who serves the worst; and he dos serve him if he must obey his commands, and depends upon his will. For this reason the Poet ingeniously flattering a good Emperor, said, that Liberty was not more desirable, than to serve a gentle Master; but still acknowledg'd that it was a service, distinct from, and contrary to Liberty: and it had not bin a handsom complement, unless the evil of servitude were so extreme, that nothing but the vertue and goodness of the Master could any way compensate or alleviate it. Now tho it should be granted that he had spoken more like to a Philosopher than a Poet; that we might take his words in the strictest sense, and think it possible to find such Conveniences in a subjection to the will of a good and wise Master, as may balance the loss of Liberty, it would be no∣thing to the question; because that Liberty is thereby acknowledg'd to be destroy'd by the Prerogative, which is only instituted to preserve it. If it were true, that no liberty were to be prefer'd before the service of a good Master, it could be of no use to the perishing world, which <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Disciples would by such arguments bring into a subjection to children, fools, mad or vicious men. These are not cases feign'd upon a distant imaginary possibility, but so frequently found amongst men, that there are few examples of the contrary. And as 'tis folly to suppose that Princes will always be wise, just and good, when we know that few have bin able alone to bear the weight of a Government, or to resist the temptations to ill, that accompany an unlimited power, it would be madness to presume they will for the future be free from infirmitys and vices. And if they be not, the Nations under them will not be in such a condition of servitude to a good Master as the Poet compares to Liberty, but in a miserable and shameful subjection to the will of those who know not how to govern themselves, or to do good to others. Tho <HI>Moses, Joshua</HI> and <HI>Samuel</HI> had bin able to bear the weight of an unrestrain'd Power: tho <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> had never abus'd that which they had; what effect could this have upon a general Proposition? Where are the Familys that always produce such as they were? When did God pro∣mise to assist all those who should attain to the Sovereign Power, as he did them whom he chose for the works he design'd? Or what testimony can <HI>Filmer</HI> give us, that he has bin present with all those who have hi∣therto reign'd in the world? But if we know that no such thing either is, or has bin; and can find no promise to assure us, nor reason to hope that it ever will be, 'tis as foolish to found the hopes of preserving a People upon that which never was, or is so likely to fail, nay rather which in a short time most certainly will fail, as to root up Vines and Figtrees in expectation of gathering grapes and figs from thistles and briars. This would be no less than to extinguish the light of common sense, to neglect the means that God has given us to provide for our secu∣rity, and to impute to him a disposition of things utterly inconsistent with his Wisdom and Goodness. If he has not therefore order'd that thorns and thistles should produce figs and grapes, nor that the most important works in the world, which are not without the utmost difficulty, if at all, to be perform'd by the best and wisest of men, should be put into

 the hands of the weakest, most foolish and worst, he cannot have or∣dain'd that such men, women or children as happen to be born in reign∣ing Familys, or get the power into their hands by fraud, treachery or murder (as very many have done) should have a right of disposing all things according to their will. And if men cannot be guilty of so great an absurdity to trust the weakest and worst with a Power which usually subverts the Wisdom and Vertue of the best; or to expect such effects of Vertue and Wisdom from those who come by chance, as can hardly, if at all, be hop'd from the most excellent; our Author's Proposition can neither be grounded upon the Ordinance of God, nor the Institution of men. Nay, if any such thing had bin establish'd by our first Parents in their simplicity, the utter impossibility of attaining what they expected from it, must wholly have abrogated the Establishment: Or rather, it had bin void from the beginning, because it was not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sanctio recta, jubens honesta, prohibens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia. <BIBL>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>a just Sanction, commanding things good, and forbidding the contrary,</HI> but a foolish and per∣verse Sanction, setting up the unruly appetites of one person to the sub∣version of all that is good in the world, by making the wisdom of the aged and experienc'd to depend upon the will of Women, Children and Fools; by sending the strong and the brave to seek protection from the most weak and cowardly, and subjecting the most vertuous and best of men to be destroy'd by the most wicked and vicious. These being the effects of that unlimited prerogative, which our Author says was only instituted for the good and defence of the people, it must necessarily fall to the ground, unless slavery, misery, infamy, destruction and desolation tend to the preservation of Liberty, and are to be prefer'd before strength, glory, plenty, security and happiness. The state of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire after the Usurpation of <HI>Cesar</HI> will set this matter in the clearest light; but having done it already in the former parts of this work, I content my self to refer to those places. And tho the Calamitys they suffer'd were a little allay'd and moderated by the Vertues of <HI>Antoninus</HI> and <HI>M. Aurelius,</HI> with one or two more, yet we have no example of the continu∣ance of them in a family; nor of any Nation great or small that has bin under an absolute Power, which dos not too plainly manifest that no man or succession of men is to be trusted with it.</P>
<P>But says our Author, <HI>there can be no Law where there is not a supreme Power;</HI> and from thence very strongly concludes it must be in the King; for <HI>otherwise there can be no Sovereign Majesty in him, and he is but an equi∣vocal King.</HI> This might have bin of some force, if Governments were establish'd, and Laws made only to advance that Sovereign Majesty; but nothing at all to the purpose, if (as he confesses) the power which he has be given for the good of the People, and for the defence of every private man's Life, Liberty, Lands and Goods: for that which is insti∣tuted, cannot be abrogated for want of that which was never intended in the institution. If the publick Safety be provided, Liberty and Pro∣priety secur'd, Justice administer'd, Vertue encourag'd, Vice supprest, and the true interest of the Nation advanc'd, the ends of Government are accomplish'd; and the highest must be contented with such a propor∣tion of Glory and Majesty as is consistent with the publick; since the Magistracy is not instituted, nor any person plac'd in it for the increase of his Majesty, but for the preservation of the whole People, and the de∣fence of the Liberty, Life and Estate of every private man, as our Author himself is forc'd to acknowledg.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="329"/>
But what is this Sovereign Majesty, so inseparable from Royalty, that one cannot subsist without the other? <HI>Caligula</HI> plac'd it in a power of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Omnia mihi in omnes licere. <BIBL>Sueton.</BIBL></NOTE>doing what he pleas'd to all men: <HI>Nimrod, Nabuchodonosor</HI> and others, with an impious and barbarous insolence, boasted of the greatness of their power. They thought it a glorious Privilege to kill or spare whom they pleas'd. But such Kings as by God's permission might have bin set up over his people, were to have nothing of this. They were not to multiply Gold, Silver, Wives or Horses; they were not to govern by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE>their own will, but according to the Law; from which they might not recede, nor raise their Hearts above their brethren. Here were Kings without that unlimited Power, which makes up the Sovereign Majesty, that <HI>Filmer</HI> affirms to be so essential to Kings, that without it they are only equivocal; which proving nothing but the incurable perversness of his judgment, the malice of his heart or malignity of his fate, always to oppose reason and truth, we are to esteem those to be Kings who are describ'd to be so by the Scriptures, and to give another name to those who endeavour to advance their own glory, contrary to the precept of God and the interest of mankind.</P>
<P>But unless the light of reason had bin extinguish'd in him, he might have seen, that tho no Law could be made without a supreme Power, that Supremacy may be in a Body consisting of many men, and several orders of men. If it be true, which perhaps may be doubted, that there have bin in the world simple Monarchys, Aristocracys or Democracys legally establish'd, 'tis certain that the most part of the Governments of the world (and I think all that are or have bin good) were mix'd. Part of the Power has bin confer'd upon the King, or the Magistrate that represented him, and part upon the Senat and People, as has bin prov'd in relation to the Governments of the <HI>Hebrews, Spar∣tans, Romans, Venetians, Germans,</HI> and all those who live under that which is usually call'd the Gothic Polity. If the single Person participa∣ting of this divided Power dislike either the Name he bears, or the Au∣thority he has, he may renounce it; but no reason can be from thence drawn to the prejudice of Nations, who give so much as they think con∣sistent with their own good, and reserve the rest to themselves, or to such other Officers as they please to establish.</P>
<P>No man will deny that several Nations have had a right of giving power to Consuls, Dictators, Archons, Suffetes, Dukes and other Ma∣gistrats, in such proportions as seem'd most conducing to their own good; and there must be a right in every Nation of allotting to Kings so much as they please, as well as to the others, unless there be a charm in the word King, or in the Letters that compose it. But this cannot be; for there is no similitude between <HI>King, Rex,</HI> and <HI>Basileus:</HI> they must there∣fore have a right of regulating the Power of Kings, as well as that of Consuls or Dictators; and it had not bin more ridiculous in <HI>Fabius, Sci∣pio, Camillus</HI> or <HI>Cincinnatus,</HI> to assert an absolute power in himself, under pretence of advancing his Sovereign Majesty against the Law, than for any King to do the like. But as all Nations give what form they please to their Government, they are also judges of the name to be impos'd upon each man who is to have a part in the power: and 'tis as lawful for us to call him King, who has a limited Authority amongst us, as for the <HI>Medes</HI> or <HI>Arabs</HI> to give the same name to one who is more absolute.
<PB N="322" REF="330"/>
 If this be not admitted, we are content to speak improperly, but utterly deny that when we give the name, we give any thing more than we please; and had rather his Majesty should change his name than to renounce our own Rights and Libertys which he is to preserve, and which we have re∣ceiv'd from God and Nature.</P>
<P>But that the folly and wickedness of our Author may not be capable of any farther aggravation, he says, <HI>That it skills not how he come by the power.</HI> Violence therefore or fraud, treachery or murder, are as good as Election, Donation, or legal Succession. 'Tis in vain to examin the Laws of God or Man, or the rights of nature; whether Children do inherit the Dignitys and Magistracys of their Fathers, as patrimonial Lands and Goods; whether regard ought to be had to the fitness of the Person; whether all should go to one, or be divided amongst them; or by what rule we may know who is the right Heir to the Succession, and consequently what we are in conscience oblig'd to do. Our Author tells us in short, it matters not how he that has the power comes by it.</P>
<P>It has bin hitherto thought, that to kill a King (especially a good King) was a most abominable action. They who did it, were thought to be incited by the worst of passions that can enter into the hearts of men; and the severest punishments have bin invented to deter them from such attempts, or to avenge their death upon those who should accomplish it. But if our Author may be credited, it must be the most commendable and glorious act that can be perform'd by man: for besides the outward ad∣vantages that men so earnestly desire, he that dos it, is presently invested with the Sovereign Majesty, and at the same time becomes God's Vice∣gerent, and the father of his Country, possest of that Government, which in exclusion to all other forms is only favour'd by the Laws of God and Nature. The only inconvenience is, that all depends upon success, and he that is to be the Minister of God, and father of his Country if he succeed, is the worst of all villains if he fail; and at the best may be depriv'd of all by the same means he employ'd to gain it. Tho a Prince should have the wisdom and vertues of <HI>Moses,</HI> the valor of <HI>Joshua, Da∣vid</HI> and the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> with the gentleness and integrity of <HI>Samuel,</HI> the most foolish, vitious, base and detestable man in the world that kills him, and seizes the power, becomes his Heir, and father of the People that he govern'd; it <HI>skills</HI> not how he did it, whether in open battel or secret treachery, in the field or in the bed, by poison or by the sword: The vilest slave in <HI>Israel</HI> had become the Lord's anointed, if he could have kill'd <HI>David</HI> or <HI>Solomon,</HI> and found villains to place him in the Throne. If this be right, the world has to this day liv'd in darkness, and the actions which have bin thought to be the most detestable, are the most commendable and glorious. But not troubling my self at pre∣sent to decide this question, I leave it to Kings to consider how much they are beholden to <HI>Filmer</HI> and his disciples, who set such a price upon their heads, as would render it hard to preserve their Lives one day, if the Doctrins were receiv'd, which they endeavour to infuse into the Minds of the People; and concluding this point, only say, that we in <HI>England</HI> know no other King than he who is so by Law, nor any power in that King except that which he has by Law: And tho the Roman Empire was held by the power of the Sword; and <HI>Ʋlpian</HI> a corrupt Lawyer undertakes to fay, that <HI>the Prince is not oblig'd by the Laws;</HI> yet <HI>Theodosius</HI> consest, that it was the glory of a good Emperor to acknowledg himself bound by them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXII. The rigor of the Law is to be temper'd by men of known inte∣grity and judgment, and not by the Prince who may be ignorant or vicious.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's next shift is to place the King above the Law, that he may mitigate the rigor of it, without which, he says, <HI>the case of the Subject would be desperately miserable.</HI> But this cure would prove worse than the disease. Such pious fathers of the People as <HI>Caligula, Nero</HI> or <HI>Domitian,</HI> were not like to mitigate the rigor; nor such as inherit Crowns in their infancy (as the present Kings of <HI>Spain, France</HI> and <HI>Swe∣den)</HI> so well to understand the meaning of it as to decide extraordinary cases. The wisdom of Nations has provided more assured helps; and none could have bin so brutish and negligent of the publick Concern∣ments, to suffer the Succession to fall to women, children, &amp;c. if they had not reserv'd a power in themselves to prefer others before the nearest in blood, if reason require; and prescrib'd such rules as might preserve the publick from ruin, notwithstanding their infirmitys and vices. These helps provided by our Laws, are principally by grand and petit Jurys, who are not only Judges of matters of fact, as whether a man be kill'd, but whether he be kill'd criminally. These Men are upon their Oaths, and may be indicted of Perjury if they prevaricate: The Judges are present not only to be a check upon them, but to explain such points of the Law as may seem difficult. And tho these Judges may be said in some sense to be chosen by the King, he is not understood to do it otherwise than by the advice of his Council, who cannot perform their duty, unless they propose such as in their consciences they think most worthy of the Office, and most capable of performing the duty rightly; nor he accomplish the Oath of his Coronation, unless he admit those, who upon deliberation seem to be the best. The Judges being thus cho∣sen, are so far from depending upon the will of the King, that they swear faithfully to serve the People as well as the King, and to do justice to <NOTE PLACE="marg">18 Edw. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. cap. 1.</NOTE>every man according to the Law of the Land, notwithstanding any Writs, Letters or Commands receiv'd from him; and in default thereof they are to forfeit their bodys, lands and goods, as in cases of Treason. These Laws have bin so often, and so severely executed, that it concerns all Judges well to consider them; and the Cases of <HI>Tresilian, Empson, Dudley,</HI> and others shew, that neither the King's preceding command nor subsequent pardon could preserve them from the punishment they deserv'd. All men knew that what they did was agreeable to the King's pleasure, for <HI>Tresilian</HI> advanc'd the Prerogative of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<HI>d,</HI> and <HI>Empson</HI> brought great Treasures into the Coffers of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th.</HI> Ne∣vertheless they were charg'd with Treason, for subverting the Laws of the Land, and executed as Traitors. Tho <HI>England</HI> ought never to forget the happy Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> yet it must be acknowledg'd that she as well as others had her failings. She was full of love to the People, just in her nature, sincere in her intentions; but could not so perfectly dis∣cover the snares that were laid for her, or resist the importunity of the Persons she most trusted, as not sometimes to be brought to attempt
<PB N="324" REF="332"/>
 things against Law. She and her Counsellors prest the Judges very hard to obey the Patent under her Great Seal, in the case of <HI>Cavendish:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Anderson's Rep. p. 155.</NOTE>but they answer'd, <HI>That both she and they had taken an Oath to keep the Law, and if they should obey her commands, the Law would not warrant them,</HI> &amp;c. And besides the offence against God, their Country, and the Commonwealth, they alledg'd the example of <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley, whereby,</HI> they said, <HI>they were deter'd from obeying her illegal Commands.</HI> They who had sworn to keep the Law notwithstanding the King's Writs, knew that the Law depended not upon his will: and the same Oath that oblig'd them not to regard any command they should receive from him, shew'd that they were not to expect indemnity by it; and not only that the King had neither the power of making, altering, miti∣gating or interpreting the Law, but that he was not at all to be heard, in general or particular matters, otherwise than as he speaks in the com∣mon course of Justice, by the Courts legally establish'd, which say the same thing, whether he be young or old, ignorant or wise, wicked or good. And nothing dos better evidence the wisdom and care of our Ancestors, in framing the Laws and Government we live under, than that the People did not suffer extremitys by the vices or infirmitys of Kings, till an Age more full of malice than those in which they liv'd, had found tricks to pervert the rule, and frustrate their honest intentions. It was not safe for the Kings to violate their Oaths by an undue inter∣position of their Authority; but the Ministers who serv'd them in those violations, have seldom escap'd punishment. This is to be understood when the deviations from Justice are extreme and mischievous, for some∣thing must always be allow'd to human frailty: The best have their defects, and none could stand if a too exact scrutiny were made of all their actions. <HI>Edward</HI> the third, about the twentieth year of his Reign, acknowledg'd his own in Parliament, and as well for the ease of his Conscience, as the satisfaction of his People, promoted an Act, <HI>Com∣manding all Judges to do Justice, notwithstanding any Writs, Letters or Com∣mands from himself; and forbidding those that belong'd to the King, Queen and Prince, to intermeddle in those matters.</HI> But if the best and wisest of our Princes, in the strength and maturity of their years, had their failings, and every act proceeding from them that tended to the interruption of Justice was a failing, how can it be said that the King in his personal ca∣pacity, directly or indirectly, may enter into the discussion of these mat∣ters, much less to determin them according to his will?</P>
<P><HI>But,</HI> says our Author, <HI>the Law is no better than a Tyrant; general Pardons at the Coronation and in Parliament, are but the bounty of the Pre∣rogative,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>There may be hard cases:</HI> and citing some perverted pieces from <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Ethicks and Politicks, adds, <HI>That when something falls out besides the general rule, then it is fit that what the Lawmaker has omitted, or where he has err'd by speaking generally, it should be corrected and supply'd, as if the Lawmaker were present that ordain'd it. The Go∣vernor, whether he be one man or more, ought to be Lord of these things, whereof it was impossible that the Law should speak exactly.</HI> These things are in part true; but our Author makes use of them as the Devil dos of Scripture, to subvert the truth. There may be something of rigor in the Law, that in some cases may be mitigated; and the Law it self (in relation to <HI>England)</HI> dos so far acknowledg it, as to refer much to the consciences of Jurys, and those who are appointed to assist them; and the most difficult Cases are refer'd to the Parliament as the only judges that are able to determin them.
<PB N="325" REF="333"/>
Thus the Statute of 35 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. enumerating the crimes then declar'd to be Treason, leaves to future Parliaments to judg what other facts equivalent to them may deserve the same punishment: and 'tis a general rule in the Law, which the Judges are sworn to observe, that difficult Cases should be reserv'd till the Parliament meet, who are only able to decide them: and if there be any inconvenience in this, 'tis because they do not meet so frequently as the Law requires, or by sinister means are interrupted in their sitting. But nothing can be more absurd than to say, that because the King dos not call Parliaments as the Law and his Oath requires, that power should accrue to him, which the Law and the consent of the Nation has plac'd in them.</P>
<P>There is also such a thing in the Law as a general or particular Par∣don, and the King may in some degree be entrusted with the power of giving it, especially for such crimes as merely relate to himself, as every man may remit the injurys done to himself; but the confession of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>That the Oath of the Crown had not bin kept by reason of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Edw. 3. 15.</NOTE><HI>the grant of Pardons contrary to Statutes,</HI> and a new Act made, <HI>that all such Charters of Pardon from henceforth granted against the Oath of the Crown and the said Statutes, should be held for none,</HI> demonstrates that this power was not in himself, but granted by the Nation, and to be executed according to such rules as the Law prescrib'd, and the Parlia∣ment approv'd.</P>
<P>Moreover, there have bin many, and sometimes bloody contests for the Crown, upon which the Nation was almost equally divided; and it being difficult for them to know, or even for us who have all the partys before us, to judg which was the better side, it was understood that he who came to be crown'd by the consent of the People, was acceptable to all: and the question being determin'd, it was no way fit that he should have a liberty to make use of the publick Authority then in his hands, to revenge such personal injurys as he had, or might suppose to have receiv'd, which might raise new, and perhaps more dan∣gerous troubles, if the Authors of them were still kept in fear of being prosecuted; and nothing could be more unreasonable than that he should employ his power to the destruction of those who had consented to make him King. This made it a matter of course for a King, as soon as he was crown'd, to issue out a general Pardon, which was no more than to declare, that being now what he was not before, he had no enemy upon any former account. For this reason <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth of <HI>France,</HI> when he was incited to revenge himself against those, who in the reign of his Predecessor <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth had caus'd him to be imprison'd with great danger of his life, made this answer, <HI>That the King of</HI> France <HI>did not care to revenge the injurys done to the Duke of</HI> Orleans: and the last King of <HI>Sweden</HI> seem'd no otherwise to remember who had oppos'd the Queen's Abdication and his Election, than by conferring honors upon them; because he knew they were the best men of the Nation, and such as would be his friends when they should see how he would govern, in which he was not deceiv'd. But lest all those who might come to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> should not have the same prudence and generosity, the Kings were oblig'd by a Custom of no less force than a Law, immediately to put an end to all disputes, and the inconveniences that might arise from them. This did not proceed from the bounty of the Prerogative (which I think is nonsense, for tho he that enjoys the Prerogative may have bounty,
<PB N="326" REF="334"/>
 the Prerogative can have none) but from common sense, from the King's obligation, and the care of his own safety; and could have no other effect in Law, than what related to his person, as appears by the fore∣mention'd Statute.</P>
<P>Pardons granted by Act of Parliament are of another nature: For as the King who has no other power than by Law, can no otherwise dis∣pense with the crimes committed against the Laws, than the Law dos enable him; the Parliament that has the power of making Laws, may intirely abolish the crimes, and unquestionably remit the punishment as they please.</P>
<P>Tho some words of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Ethicks are without any coherence shuffled together by our Author, with others taken out of his Politicks, I do not much except against them. No Law made by man can be per∣fect, and there must be in every Nation a power of correcting such de∣fects as in time may arise or be discover'd. This power can never be so rightly plac'd as <HI>in the same Hand that has the right of making Laws, whe∣ther in one person or in many.</HI> If <HI>Filmer</HI> therefore can tell us of a place, where one man, woman or child, however he or she be qualify'd, has the power of making Laws, I will acknowledg that not only the <HI>hard Cases,</HI> but as many others as he pleases, are refer'd to his or her judgment, and that they may give it, whether they have any understanding of what they do or not, whether they be drunk or sober, in their senses or stark mad. But as I know no such place, and should not be much concern'd for the sufferings of a People that might bring such misery upon themselves, as must accompany an absolute dependence upon the unruly will of such a creature, I may leave him to seek it, and rest in a perfect assurance that he dos not speak of <HI>England,</HI> which acknowledges no other Law than its own; and instead of receiving any from Kings, dos to this day obey none, but such as have bin made by our Ancestors, or our selves, and never admitted any King that did not swear to observe them. And if <HI>Aristotle</HI> deserve credit, the power of altering, mitigating, explaining or correcting the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> is only in the Parliament, <HI>because none but the</HI> Parliament <HI>can make them.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIII. <HI>Aristotle</HI> proves, that no man is to be intrusted with an absolute Power, by shewing that no one knows how to execute it, but such a man as is not to be found.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author having falsly cited and perverted the sense of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> now brings him in saying, <HI>That a perfect Kingdom is that wherein the King rules all according to his own Will.</HI> But tho I have read his books of Government with some attention, I can find no such thing in them, unless the word which signifies <HI>mere</HI> or <HI>absolute</HI> may be justly translated into <HI>perfect:</HI> which is so far from <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s meaning, that he distinguish∣es the absolute or despotical Kingdoms from the Legitimate; and com∣mending the latter, gives no better name than that of <HI>barbarous</HI> to the first, which he says can agree only with the nature of such Nations as are base and stupid, little differing from Beasts; and having no skill to
<PB N="327" REF="335"/>
govern, or courage to defend themselves, must resign all to the will of one that will take care of them. Yet even this cannot be done, unless he that should take that care be wholly exempted from the vices which oblige the others to stand in need of it: for otherwise 'tis no better than if a Sheep should undertake to govern Sheep, or a Hog to command Swine; <HI>Aristotle</HI> plainly saying, <HI>That as men are by nature equal, if it were</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Polit. l. 2. c. 1.</NOTE><HI>possible all should be Magistrats.</HI> But that being repugnant to the nature of Government, he finds no other way of solving the difficulty, than by <HI>obeying and commanding alternately;</HI> that they may do by turns that which they cannot do all together, and to which no one man has more right than another, because they are all by nature equal. This might be com∣pos'd by a more compendious way, if, according to our Author's doctrin, Possession could give a Right. But <HI>Aristotle</HI> speaking like a Philosopher, and not like a publick Enemy to Mankind, examins what is just, reason∣able and beneficial to men; that is, what ought to be done, and which being done, is to be accounted just, and therefore to be supported by good men. But as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quod ab initio injustum est, nullum potest habere juris effectum. <BIBL>Grot. de jur. bel. &amp; pac. l. <HI>3.</HI></BIBL></NOTE><HI>that which is unjust in the beginning, can never have the effect of Justice;</HI> and it being manifestly unjust for one or a few men to assume a power over those who by nature are equal to them, no such power can be just or beneficial to mankind; nor fit to be upheld by good men, if it be unjust and prejudicial. In the opinion of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> this natural equality continues till vertue makes the distinction; which must be either simply compleat and perfect in it self, so that he who is endu'd with it, is a God among men, or relatively, as far as concerns civil Socie∣ty, and the ends for which it is constituted, that is, defence, and the ob∣taining of Justice. This requires a mind unbiass'd by passion, full of goodness and wisdom, firm against all the temptations to ill, that may arise from desire or fear; tending to all manner of good, thro a perfect knowledg and affection to it; and this to such a degree, that he or they have more of these vertues and excellencys than all the rest of the Society, tho computed together. Where such a man is found, he is by nature a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. l. 3.</NOTE>King, and 'tis best for the Nation where he is that he govern. If a few men, tho equal and alike among themselves, have the same advantages above the rest of the People, Nature for the same reason seems to esta∣blish an Aristocracy in that place; and the power is more safely commit∣ted to them, than left in the hands of the multitude. But if this excel∣lency of vertue dos not appear in one, nor in a few men, the right and power is by nature equally lodg'd in all; and to assume or appropriate that power to one, or a few men, is unnatural and tyrannical, which in <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s language comprehends all that is detestable and abominable.</P>
<P>If any man should think <HI>Aristotle</HI> a trifler, for speaking of such a man as can never be found, I answer, that he went as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar as his way could be warranted by reason or nature, and was oblig'd to stop there by the de∣fect of his Subject. He could not say that the Government os one was simply good, when he knew so many qualifications were requir'd in the person to make it so; nor that it is good for a Nation to be under the power of a sool, a coward, or a villain, because 'tis good to be under a man of admirable wisdom, valor, industry and goodness; or that the Government of one should be continu'd in such as by chance succeed in a Family, because it was given to the first who had all the vertues requir'd,
<PB N="328" REF="336"/>
 tho all the reasons for which the power was given fail in the Successor; much less could he say that any Government was good, which was not good for those whose good only it was constituted to promote.</P>
<P>Moreover, by shewing who only is fit to be a Monarch, or may be made such, without violating the Laws of Nature and Justice, he shews who cannot be one: and he who says that no such man is to be found, as according to the opinion of <HI>Aristotle</HI> can be a Monarch, dos most ridiculously alledg his Authority in favor of Monarchs, or the power which some a∣mongst us would attribute to them. If any thing therefore may be con∣cluded from his words, 'tis this, That since no power ought to be admit∣ted which is not just; that none can be just which is not good, profitable to the People, and conducing to the ends for which it is constituted; that no man can know how to direct the power to those ends, can deserve, or administer it, unless he dos so far excel all those that are under him in wisdom, justice, valor and goodness, as to possess more of those vertues than all of them: I say, if no such man or succession of men be found, no such power is to be granted to any man, or succession of men. But if such power be granted, the Laws of nature and reason are overthrown, and the ends for which Societys are constituted, utterly perverted, which necessarily implys an annihilation of the Grant. And if a Grant so made by those who have a right of setting up a Government amongst them∣selves, do perish thro its own natural iniquity and perversity, I leave it to any man, whose understanding and manners are not so intirely cor∣rupted as those of our Author, to determin what name ought to be given to that person, who not excelling all others in Civil and Moral Vertues, in the proportion requir'd by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> dos usurp a power over a Nation, and what obedience the People owe to such a one.

<HEAD>SECT. XXIV. The Power of <HI>Augustus Cesar</HI> was not given, but usurp'd.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's next instance is ingeniously taken from the <HI>Romans, Who,</HI> he says, <HI>tho they were a People greedy of Liberty, freed</HI> Augustus <HI>from the necessity of Laws.</HI> If it be true, as he affirms, that such a Pre∣rogative is instituted only for the preservation of Liberty, they who are most greedy of it, ought to be most forward in establishing that which defends it best. But if the weight laid upon the words <HI>greedy of Liber∣ty,</HI> &amp;c. render his memory and judgment liable to censure, the unpar∣donable prevarication of citing any act done by the <HI>Romans</HI> in the time of <HI>Augustus,</HI> as done freely, shews him to be a man of no faith. <HI>Omnium jura in se traxerat,</HI> says <HI>Tacitus</HI> of <HI>Augustus;</HI> nothing was confer'd upon him, he took all to himself; there could be nothing of right in that which was wholly usurp'd, and neither the People or the Senat could do any

thing freely, whilst they were under the power of a mad corrupted Sol∣diery, who first betray'd, and then subdu'd them. The greatest part of the Senat had fall'n at the battel of <HI>Pharsalia,</HI> others had bin glean'd up in several places, the rest destroy'd by the Proscriptions; and that which then retain'd the name of a Senat, was made up chiefly of those who had bin his Ministers, in bringing the most miserable slavery upon their own Country. The <HI>Roman</HI> Liberty, and that bravery of spirit by which it had bin maintain'd, was not only abolish'd, but almost forgotten. All consideration of Law and Right was trampl'd under foot; and none could dispute with him, who by the power of the sword had seiz'd the Authority both of the Senat and People. Nothing was so extravagant, that might not be extorted by the insolent violence of a Conqueror, who had thirty mercenary Legions to execute his Commands. The uncor∣rupted part of the People that had escap'd the sword of <HI>Julius,</HI> had ei∣ther perish'd with <HI>Hirtius</HI> and <HI>Pansa, Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius,</HI> or bin destroy'd by the detestable <HI>Triumvirate.</HI> Those that remain'd could lose nothing by a verbal resignation of their Liberty, which they had neither strength nor courage to defend. The Magistracys were possest by the Creatures of the Tyrant; and the People were compos'd of such as were either born under slavery, and accustom'd to obey, or remain'd under the ter∣ror of those Arms that had consum'd the Assertors of their Liberty. Our Author standing in need of some <HI>Roman</HI> Example, was oblig'd to seek it in an age, when the Laws were subverted, Vertue extinguish'd, Injustice plac'd in the Throne, and such as would not be of the same spirit, expos'd to the utmost cruelty. This was the time when the <HI>So∣vereign Majesty</HI> shin'd in glory; and they who had rais'd it above the Law, made it also the object of their Religion, by adoring the Statues of their Oppressor. The corruption of this Court spread it self over the best part of the World; and reduc'd the Empire to that irrecover∣able weakness in which it languish'd and perish'd. This is the state of things that pleases <HI>Filmer,</HI> and those that are like him, who for the intro∣duction of the same among us, recommend such an elevation of the So∣vereign Majesty, as is most contrary to the Laws of God and Men, ab∣hor'd by all generous Nations, and most especially by our Ancestors, who thought nothing too dear to be hazarded in the defence of them∣selves and us from it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXV. The Regal Power was not the first in this Nation; nor necessarily to be continu'd, tho it had bin the first.</HEAD>
<P>TRUTH being uniform in it self, those who desire to propagate it for the good of Mankind, lay the foundations of their reason∣ings in such Principles, as are either evident to common sense, or easily prov'd: but Cheats and Impostors delighting in obscurity, suppose things that are dubious and false, and think to build one falshood upon another; and our Author can find no better way to persuade us, that all our Privileges and Laws are from the King, than by saying, <HI>That the first Power was the Kingly Power, which was both in this and all other Nations</HI>
<PB N="330" REF="338"/>
 <HI>in the world, long before any Laws or any other kind of Government was thought of; from whence we must necessarily infer, that the common Law, or common Customs of this Land were originally the Laws and Commands of the King.</HI> But denying both these points, I affirm,</P>
<P>1. That there was a power to make Kings before there was any King.</P>
<P>2. Tho Kings had bin the first created Magistrats in all places (as per∣haps they were in some it dos not follow) that they must continue for ever, or that Laws are from them.</P>
<P>To the first; I think no man will deny, that there was a People at <HI>Babylon,</HI> before <HI>Nimrod</HI> was King of that place. This People had a Power; for no number of men can be without it: Nay this People had a power of making <HI>Nimrod</HI> King, or he could never have bin King. He could not be King by succession, for the Scripture shews him to have bin the first. He was not King by the right of Father, for he was not their Father, <HI>Chush, Cham,</HI> with his elder Brothers and Father <HI>Noah</HI> be∣ing still living; and, which is worst of all, were not Kings: for if they who liv'd in <HI>Nimrod</HI>'s time, or before him, neither were Kings, nor had Kings, he that ought to have bin King over all by the right of nature (if there had bin any such thing in nature) was not King. Those who immediately succeeded him, and must have inherited his right, if he had any, did not inherit or pretend to it: and therefore he that shall now claim a right from nature as Father of a People, must ground it upon something more certain than <HI>Noah</HI>'s right of reigning over his Children, or it can have no strength in it.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Nations who in and before the time of <HI>Nimrod</HI> had no Kings, had Power, or else they could have perform'd no Act, nor con∣stituted any other Magistrate to this day, which is absurd. There was therefore a power in Nations before there were Kings, or there could never have bin any; and <HI>Nimrod</HI> could never have bin King, if the Peo∣ple of <HI>Babylon</HI> had not made him King, which they could not have done if they had not had a power of making him so. 'Tis ridiculous to say he made himself King, for tho he might be strong and valiant, he could not be stronger than a multitude of men. That which forces must be stron∣ger than that which is forc'd; and if it be true, according to the antient saying, that <HI>Hercules</HI> himself is not sufficient to encounter two, 'tis sure more impossible for one man to force a multitude, for that must be strong∣er than he. If he came in by persuasion, they who were persuaded, were persuaded to consent that he should be King. That Consent there∣fore made him King. But, <HI>Qui dat esse, dat modum esse:</HI> They who made him King, made him such a King as best pleas'd themselves. He had therefore nothing but what was given: his greatness and power must be from the multitude who gave it: and their Laws and Libertys could not be from him; but their Libertys were naturally inherent in themselves, and their Laws were the product of them.</P>
<P>There was a People that made <HI>Romulus</HI> King. He did not make or beget that People, nor, for any thing we know, one man of them. He could not come in by inheritance, for he was a Bastard, the Son of an un∣known man; and when he dy'd, the right that had bin confer'd upon him reverted to the People, who, according to that right, chose <HI>Numa, Hostilius, Martius, Tarquinius Priscas,</HI> and <HI>Servius,</HI> all Stranges to his blood, and without any other right than what was bestow'd upon them: and <HI>Tarquinius Superbus,</HI> who invaded the Throne <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sinc jussu populi. <BIBL>T. Liv. l. <HI>1.</HI></BIBL></NOTE><HI>without the command</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="339"/>
<HI>of the People,</HI> was ejected, and the Government of Kings abolish'd by the same power that had created it.</P>
<P>We know not certainly by what Law <HI>Moses,</HI> and the Judges created by the advice of <HI>Jethro,</HI> govern'd the <HI>Israelites;</HI> but may probably con∣jecture it to have bin by that Law which God had written in the hearts of mankind; and the People submitted to the judgment of good and wise men, tho they were under no coercive Power. But 'tis certain they had a Law and a regular Magistracy under which they liv'd, four hun∣dred years before they had a King, for <HI>Saul</HI> was the first. This Law was not therefore from the King, nor by the King; but the King was chosen and made by the People, according to the liberty they had by the Law, tho they did not rightly follow the rules therein prescrib'd, and by that means brought destruction upon themselves.</P>
<P>The Country in which we live lay long conceal'd under obscure bar∣barity, and we know nothing of the first Inhabitants, but what is in∣volv'd in fables that leave us still in the dark. <HI>Julius Cesar</HI> is the first who speaks distinctly of our affairs, and gives us no reason to believe there was any Monarchy then establish'd amongst us. <HI>Cassivellaunus</HI> was occasionally chosen by the Nations that were most expos'd to the violence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caes. Com∣ment. l. 5.</NOTE>of the <HI>Romans,</HI> for the management of those wars against them. By others we hear of <HI>Boadicia, Arviragus, Galgacus,</HI> and many more set up afterwards when need requir'd; but we find no footsteps of a regular Succession either by inheritance or election. And as they had then no Kings, or any other general Magistrate, that can be said to be equivalent to a King, they might have had none at all unless they had thought fit. <HI>Tacitus</HI> mentions a sort of Kings, us'd by the <HI>Romans</HI> to keep <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inter instrumenta servitutis reges habu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re. <BIBL>C. Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE>Nations in servitude to them: and tho it were true that there had bin such a man as <HI>Lucius,</HI> and he one of this sort, he is to be accounted only as a <HI>Roman</HI> Magistrate, and signifys no more to our dispute, than if he had bin call'd Proconsul, Pretor, or by any other name. However there was no series of them: that which was temporary and occasional, depended upon the will of those, who thinking there was occasion, created such a Magi∣strate, and omitted to do so, when the occasion ceas'd, or was thought to cease; and might have had none at all, if they had so pleas'd. The Magistracy therefore was from them, and depenedd upon their will.</P>
<P>We have already mention'd the Historys of the <HI>Saxons, Danes</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> from which Nations, together with the <HI>Britans,</HI> we are de∣scended: and finding that they were severe Assertors of their Libertys, acknowledg'd no human Laws but their own, receiv'd no Kings but such as swore to observe them, and depos'd those who did not well perform their Oaths and Duty, 'tis evident that their Kings were made by the People according to the Law; and that the Law, by which they became what they were, could not be from themselves. Our Ancestors were so fully convinc'd that in the creation of Kings they exercis'd their own right, and were only to consider what was good for themselves, that without regard to the memory of those who had gone before, they were accustom'd to take such as seem'd most like, wisely, justly and gently to perform their office; refus'd those that were suspected of pride, cruelty, or any other vice that might bring prejudice upon the Publick, what title soever they pretended; and remov'd such as had bin plac'd in the Throne, if they did not answer the opinion conceiv'd of
<PB N="332" REF="340"/>
 their vertue; which I take to be a manner of proceeding that agrees better with the quality of Masters, making Laws and Magistrats for them∣selves, than of Slaves receiving such as were impos'd upon them.</P>
<P>2. To the second. Tho it should be granted, that all Nations had at the first bin govern'd by Kings, it were nothing to the question; for no man or number of Men was ever oblig'd to continue in the errors of his Predecessors. The Authority of Custom as well as of Law (I mean in relation to the Power that made it to be) consists only in its rectitude: And the same reason which may have induc'd one or more Nations to create Kings, when they knew no other form of Government, may not only induce them to set up another, if that be found inconvenient to them, but proves that they may as justly do so, as remove a man who performs not what was expected from him. If there had bin a Rule given by God, and written in the minds of men by nature, it must have bin from the beginning, universal and perpetual; or at least must have bin observ'd by the wisest and best instructed Nations: which not being in any measure (as I have prov'd already) there can be no reason, why a polite People should not relinquish the errors committed by their An∣cestors in the time of their barbarism and ignorance, and why they should not do it in matters of Government, as well as in any other thing relating to life. Men are subject to errors, and 'tis the work of the best and wisest to discover and amend such as their Ancestors may have committed, or to add perfection to those things which by them have bin well invented. This is so certain, that whatsoever we enjoy beyond the misery in which our barbarous Ancestors liv'd, is due only to the liberty of correcting what was amiss in their practice, or inventing that which they did not know: and I doubt whether it be more brutish to say we are oblig'd to continue in the Idolatry of the <HI>Druids,</HI> with all the miserys and follys that accompany the most savage barbarity; or to confess, that tho we have a right to depart from these, yet we are for ever bound to continue the Government they had establish'd, whatever inconveniences might at∣tend it. <HI>Tertullian</HI> disputing with the <HI>Pagans,</HI> who objected the novelty of the Christian Religion, troubled not himself with refuting that error; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nullum tempu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulla praescriptio occurrit vericuti. <BIBL>Tertul.</BIBL> Id antiquius quod verius. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>but proving Christianity to be good and true, he thought he had suffi∣ciently prov'd it to be antient. A wise Architect may shew his skill, and deserve commendation for building a poor house of vile materials, when he can procure no better; but he no way ought to hinder others from erecting more glorious Fabricks if they are furnish'd with the means re∣quir'd. Besides, such is the imperfection of all human Constitutions, that they are subject to perpetual fluctuation, which never permits them to continue long in the same condition: Corruptions slide in insensibly; and the best Orders are sometimes subverted by malice and violence: so that he who only regards what was done in such an age, often takes the corruption of the State for the institution, follows the worst example, thinks that to be the first that is the most antient he knows; and if a brave People seeing the original defects of their Government, or the corruption into which it may be fallen, do either correct and reform what may be amended, or abolish that which was evil in the institution, or so perver∣ted, that it cannot be restor'd to integrity, these men impute it to sedi∣tion, and blame those actions, which of all that can be perform'd by men are the most glorious. We are not therefore so much to inquire after
<PB N="333" REF="341"/>
that which is most antient, as that which is best, and most conducing to the good ends to which it was directed. As Governments were instituted for the obtaining of Justice, and (as our Author says) the preservation of Liberty, we are not to seek what Government was the first, but what best provides for the obtaining of Justice, and the preservation of Liber∣ty. For whatsoever the Institution be, and how long soever it may have lasted, 'tis void, if it thwarts, or dos not provide for the end of its esta∣blishment. If such a Law or Custom therefore as is not good in it self, had in the beginning prevail'd in all parts of the world (which in rela∣tion to absolute or any kind of Monarchy is not true) it ought to be abo∣lish'd; and if any man should shew himself wiser than others by pro∣posing a Law or Government, more beneficial to mankind than any that had bin formerly known, providing better for Justice and Liberty than all others had done, he would merit the highest veneration. If any man ask, who shall be Judg of that rectitude or pravity which either autho∣rises or destroys a Law? I answer, that as this consists not in formalitys and nicetys, but in evident and substantial truths, there is no need of any other Tribunal than that of common sense, and the light of nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o determin the matter: and he that travels thro <HI>France, Italy, Turky, Germany</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> without consulting <HI>Bartolus</HI> or <HI>Baldus,</HI> will easily understand whether the Countrys that are under the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> the Pope and the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> or such as are under the care of a well-regulated Magistracy, do best enjoy the benefits of Justice and Liberty. 'Tis as easily determin'd whether the <HI>Grecians</HI> when <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Thebes</HI> flourish'd were more free than the <HI>Medes;</HI> whether Justice was better administer'd by <HI>Agathocles, Dionysius</HI> and <HI>Phalaris,</HI> than by the legal Kings and regular Magistrats of <HI>Sparta;</HI> or whether more care was taken that Justice and Liberty might be preserv'd by <HI>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero</HI> and <HI>Vitellius,</HI> than by the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> whilst the Laws were more powerful than the commands of men. The like may be said of particular Laws, as those of <HI>Nabuchodonosor</HI> and <HI>Caligula,</HI> for worshipping their Statues; our Acts of Parliament against Hereticks and Lollards, with the Statutes and Orders of the Inquisition which is call'd the Holy Office. And if that only be a Law which is <HI>Sanctio recta, jubens honesta, prohibens contraria,</HI> the meanest understand∣ing, if free from passion, may certainly know that such as these cannot be Laws, by what Authority soever they were enacted; and that the use of them, and others like to them, ought to be abolish'd for their turpi∣tude and iniquity. Infinite examples of the like nature might be alledg'd, as well concerning divine as human things. And if there be any Laws which are evil, there cannot be an incontestable rectitude in all; and if not in all, it concerns us to examin where it is to be found. Laws and Constitutions ought to be weigh'd; and whilst all due reverence is paid to such as are good, every Nation may not only retain in it self a power of changing or abolishing all such as are not so, but ought to exercise that Power according to the best of their understanding; and in the place of what was either at first mistaken, or afterwards corrupted, to constitute that which is most conducing to the establishment of Justice and Liberty.</P>
<P>But such is the condition of mankind, that nothing can be so perfectly fram'd as not to give some testimony of human imbecillity, and frequent∣ly to stand in need of reparations and amendments. Many things are unknown to the wisest, and the best men can never wholly devest them∣selves of passions and affections. By this means the best and wisest are
<PB N="334" REF="342"/>
 sometimes led into Error, and stand in need of Successors like to themselves, who may find remedys for the faults they have committed; and nothing can or ought to be permanent but that which is perfect. No natural body was ever so well temper'd and organiz'd, as not to be subject to diseases, wounds or other accidents, and to need medicins and other occa∣sional helps as well as nourishment and exercise: and he who under the name of Innovation would deprive Nations of the like, dos, as much as lies in him, condemn them all to perish by the defects of their own foun∣dations. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Discors. di Macchiav. l. 2.</NOTE>Some men observing this, have propos'd a necessity of reducing every State once in an age or two, to the integrity of its first principle: but they ought to have examin'd, whether that principle be good or evil, or so good that nothing can be added to it, which none ever was; and this being so, those who would admit of no change would render Errors perpetual, and depriving Mankind of the benefits of Wisdom, Industry, Experience, and the right use of Reason, oblige all to continue in the miserable barbarity of their Ancestors, which sutes better with the nature of a Wolf than that of a Man.</P>
<P>Those who are of better understanding, weigh all things, and often find reason to abrogate that which their fathers, according to the measure of the knowledg they had, or the state of things among them, had rightly instituted, or to restore that which they had abrogated; and there can be no greater mark of a most brutish stupidity, than for men to continue in an evil way, because their fathers had brought them into it. But if we ought not too strictly to adhere to our own Constitutions, those of other Nations are less to be regarded by us; for the Laws that may be good for one People are not for all, and that which agrees with the manners of one Age, is utterly abhorrent from those of another. It were absurd to think of restoring the Laws of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> to the present inhabitants of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> who are accustom'd to the most abject slavery. It may easily be imagin'd, how the <HI>Romans, Sabins</HI> and <HI>Latins,</HI> now under the tyran∣ny of the Pope, would relish such a disciplin as flourish'd among them after the expulsion of the <HI>Tarquins;</HI> and it had bin no less preposterous to give a liberty to the <HI>Parthians</HI> of governing themselves, or for them to assume it, than to impose an absolute Monarch upon the <HI>German</HI> Na∣tion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. l. 2.</NOTE><HI>Titus Livius</HI> having observ'd this, says, that if a popular Govern∣ment had bin set up in <HI>Rome</HI> immediately upon the building of the City; and if that fierce people, which was compos'd of unruly shepherds, herds∣men, fugitive slaves, and out law'd persons, who could not suffer the Government under which they wereborn, had come to be incited by tur∣bulent Orators, they would have brought all into confusion: whereas that boisterous humor being gradually temper'd by disciplin under <HI>Romu∣lus,</HI> or taught to vent its fury against foreign enemys, and soften'd by the peaceable reign of <HI>Numa,</HI> a new Race grew up, which being all of one blood, contracted a love to their Country, and became capable of Liber∣ty, which the madness of their last King, and the leudness of his Son, gave them occasion to resume. If this was commendable in them, it must be so in other Nations. If the <HI>Germans</HI> might preserve their Liber∣ty, as well as the <HI>Parthians</HI> submit themselves to absolute Monarchy; 'tis as lawful for the descendents of those <HI>Germans</HI> to continue in it, as for the Eastern Nations to be slaves. If one Nation may justly chuse the Government that seems best to them, and continue or alter it according to the changes of times and things, the same right must belong to others. The great variety of Laws that are or have bin in the world, proceeds
<PB N="335" REF="343"/>
from this; and nothing can better shew the wisdom and vertue, or the vices and folly of Nations, than the use they make of this right: they have bin glorious or infamous, powerful or despicable, happy or misera∣ble, as they have well or ill executed it.</P>
<P>If it be said that the Law given by God to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> proceed∣ing from his wisdom and goodness, must needs be perfect and obliga∣tory to all Nations: I answer, that there is a simple and a relative perfection; the first is only in God, the other in the things he has cre∣ated. <HI>He saw that they were good;</HI> which can signify no more than that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1.</NOTE>they were good in their kind, and suted to the end for which he design'd them. For if the perfection were absolute, there could be no difference between an Angel and a Worm; and nothing could be subject to change or death, for that is imperfection. This relative perfection is seen also by his Law given to mankind in the persons of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah.</HI> It was good in the kind, fit for those times, but could never have bin enlarg'd or alter'd, if the perfection had bin simple; and no better evidence can be given to shew that it was not so, than that God did afterwards give one much more full and expli∣cit to his People. This Law also was peculiarly applicable to that People and Season; for if it had bin otherwise, the Apostles would have oblig'd Christians to the intire observation of it, as well as to abstain from idolatry, fornication and blood. But if all this be not so, then their judicial Law, and the form of their Commonwealth must be receiv'd by all; no human Law can be of any value; we are all Brethren, no man has a prerogative above another; Lands must be equally divided amongst all; Inheritances cannot be alienated for above fifty years; no man can be rais'd above the rest unless he be call'd by God, and enabled by his Spirit to conduct the People: When this man dies, he that has the same Spirit must succeed, as <HI>Joshua</HI> did to <HI>Moses,</HI> and his Children can have no title to his Office: when such a man appears, a <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> of seventy men chosen out of the whole People, are to judg such causes as relate to themselves, whilst those of greater extent and importance are refer'd to the General Assem∣blys. Here is no mention of a King, and consequently, if we must take this Law for our pattern, we cannot have one: If the point be driven to the utmost, and the precept of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> where God permitted them to have a King, if they thought fit, when they came into the promis'd Land, be understood to extend to all Nations, every one of them must have the same liberty of taking their own time, chusing him in their own way, dividing the Kingdom, having no King, and setting up other Governors when they please, as before the E∣lection of <HI>Saul,</HI> and after the return from the Captivity: and even when they have a King, he must be such a one as is describ'd in the same Chapter, who no more resembles the Sovereign Majesty that our Author adores, and agrees as little with his Maxims, as a Tribun of the Roman People.</P>
<P>We may therefore conclude, that if we are to follow the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> we must take it with all the appendages; a King can be no more, and no otherwise than he makes him: for whatever we read of the Kings they had, were extreme deviations from it. No Nation can make any Law, and our Lawyers burning their Books may betake themselves to the study of the Pentateuch, in which tho some of them may be well vers'd, yet probably the profit arising from thence will not be very great.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="344"/>
 But if we are not oblig'd to live in a conformity to the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> every People may frame Laws for themselves, and we cannot be deny'd the right that is common to all. Our Laws were not sent from Heaven, but made by our Ancestors according to the light they had, and their present occasions. We inherit the same right from them; and, as we may without vanity say that we know a little more than they did, if we find our selves prejudic'd by any Law that they made, we may repeal it. The safety of the People was their supreme Law, and is so to us: neither can we be thought less fit to judg what conduces to that end, than they were. If they in any Age had bin persuaded to put them∣selves under the power, or, in our Author's phrase, under the sovereign Majesty of a child, a fool, a mad or desperately wicked person, and had annex'd the right confer'd upon him to such as should succeed, it had not bin a <HI>just and right Sanction;</HI> and having none of the qualitys essen∣tially belonging to a Law, could not have the effect of a Law. It can∣not be for the good of a People to be govern'd by one, who by nature ought to be govern'd, or by age or accident is render'd unable to govern himself. The publick interests, and the concernments of private men in their lands, goods, libertys and lives (for the preservation of which, our Author says, the regal Prerogative is only constituted) cannot be preserv'd by one who is transported by his own passions or follys, a slave to his lusts and vices; or, which is sometimes worse, govern'd by the vilest of men and women who flatter him in them, and push him on to do such things as even they would abhor, if they were in his place. The turpitude and impious madness of such an act must necessarily make it void, by overthrowing the ends for which it was made, since that justice which was sought cannot be obtain'd, nor the evils that were fear'd prevented; and they for whose good it was intended, must ne∣cessarily have a right of abolishing it. This might be sufficient for us, tho our Ancestors had enslav'd themselves. But, God be thank'd, we are not put to that trouble: We have no reason to believe we are de∣scended from such fools and beasts, as would willingly cast themselves and us into such an excess of misery and shame, or that they were so tame and cowardly to be subjected by force or fear. We know the value they set upon their Libertys, and the courage with which they de∣fended them: and we can have no better example to incourage us, never to suffer them to be violated or diminish'd.</P>

<P><HI>I Confess that no Law can be so perfect,</HI> to provide exactly for every case that may fall out, so as to leave nothing to the discretion of the Judges, <HI>who in some measure are to interpret them: But</HI> that Laws or Customs are ever few, or that the paucity is the reason that they cannot give special rules, or that Judges do resort to those Principles or Common Law Axioms, whereupon former Judgments in cases something alike have bin
<PB N="337" REF="345"/>
given by former Judges, who all receive their Authority from the King in his right to give Sentence, <HI>I utterly deny; and affirm,</HI></P>
<P>1. That in many places, and particularly in <HI>England,</HI> the Laws are so many, that the number of them has introduc'd an uncertainty and confusion, which is both dangerous and troublesom; and the infinite variety of adjudg'd cases thwarting and contradicting each other, has render'd these difficultys inextricable. <HI>Tacitus</HI> imputes a great part of the miserys suffer'd by the <HI>Romans</HI> in his time to this abuse, and tells us, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et in corruptissima Republica plurimae Leges.</NOTE><HI>the Laws grew to be innumerable in the worst and most corrupt state of things,</HI> and that Justice was overthrown by them. By the same means in <HI>France, Italy,</HI> and other places, where the Civil Law is render'd municipal, Judgments are in a manner arbitrary; and tho the intention of our Laws be just and good, they are so numerous, and the volumes of our Statutes with the Interpretations and adjudg'd Cases so vast, that hardly any thing is so clear and fix'd, but men of wit and learning may find what will serve for a pretence to justify almost any judgment they have a mind to give. Whereas the Laws of <HI>Moses,</HI> as to the Judicial part, being short and few, Judgments were easy and certain; and in <HI>Switzerland, Sweden,</HI> and some parts of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the whole Volume that contains them may be read in few hours, and by that means no injustice can be done which is not immediately made evident.</P>
<P>2. Axioms are not rightly grounded upon judg'd Cases, but Cases are to be judg'd according to Axioms: the certain is not prov'd by the uncertain, but the uncertain by the certain; and every thing is to be esteem'd uncertain till it be prov'd to be certain. Axioms in Law are, as in Mathematicks, evident to common sense; and nothing is to be taken for an Axiom, that is not so. <HI>Euclid</HI> dos not prove his Axioms by his Propositions, but his Propositions, which are abstruse, by such Ax∣ioms as are evident to all. The Axioms of our Law do not receive their Authority from <HI>Coke</HI> and <HI>Hales,</HI> but <HI>Coke</HI> and <HI>Hales</HI> deserve praise for giving judgment according to such as are undeniably true.</P>
<P>3. The Judges reeeive their Commissions from the King; and per∣haps it may be said, that the Custom of naming them is grounded upon a right with which he is entrusted; but their power is from the Law, as that of the King also is. For he who has none originally in himself, can give none unless it be first confer'd upon him. I know not how he can well perform his Oath to govern according to Law, unless he execute the power with which he is entrusted, in naming those men to be Judges, whom in his conscience, and by the advice of his Council, he thinks the best and ablest to perform that Office: But both he and they are to learn their duty from that Law, by which they are, and which allots to every one his proper work. As the Law intends that men should be made Judges for their integrity and knowledg in the Law, and that it ought not to be imagin'd that the King will break his trust by chusing such as are not so, till the violation be evident, nothing is more reasonable than to intend that the Judges so qualify'd should instruct the King in matters of Law. But that he who may be a child, over-ag'd, or otherwise ignorant and uncapable, should instruct the Judges, is equally absurd, as for a blind man to be a guide to those who have the best eyes; and so abhorrent from the meaning of the Law, that the Judges (as I said be∣fore)
<PB N="338" REF="346"/>
 are sworn to do justice according to the Laws, without any regard to the King's words, letters or commands. If they are therefore to act according to a set rule, from which they may not depart what command soever they receive, they do not act by a power from him, but by one that is above both. This is commonly confest; and tho some Judges have bin found in several ages, who in hopes of reward and preferment have made little account of their Oath, yet the success that many of them have had, may reasonably deter others from following their example: and if there are not more instances in this kind, no better reason can be given, than that <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jure igitur plectimur; nisi enim multorum impunita feeler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tulissemus, nunquam ad unum tanta pervenisset licentia. <BIBL>Cicero.</BIBL></NOTE>Nations do frequently fail, by being too remiss in asserting their own rights or punishing offenders, and hardly ever err on the severer side.</P>
<P>4. Judgments are variously given in several States and Kingdoms, but he who would find one where they lie in the breast of the King, must go at least as far as <HI>Morocco.</HI> Nay, the Embassador who was lately here from that place, deny'd that they were absolutely in him. However 'tis certain that in <HI>England,</HI> according to the Great Charter, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iunt per pares. <BIBL>Mag. Chart.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Judgments are pass'd by equals:</HI> no man can be imprison'd, disseiz'd of his Freehold, depriv'd of Life or Limb, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> per judicium parium suorum. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>unless by the sentence of his Peers.</HI> The Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> did <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Judicabant &amp; judicabantur. <BIBL>Maimonid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>judg and were judg'd;</HI> and the Judgments they gave were in and with the Sanhedrin. In <HI>England</HI> the Kings do not judg, but are judg'd: and <HI>Bracton</HI> says, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In justitia recipienda rex cuilibet ex plebe aqualis est.</NOTE><HI>That in receiving justice the King is equal to another man;</HI> which could not be, if judgments were given by him, and he were exempted from the judgment of all by that Law, which has put all judgments into the hands of the People. This power is executed by them in grand or petty Jurys, and the Judges are assistants to them in explaining the difficult points of the Law, in which 'tis pre∣sum'd they should be learned. The strength of every judgment consists in the verdict of these Jurys, which the Judges do not give, but pro∣nounce or declare: and the same Law that makes good a verdict given contrary to the advice or direction of the Judges, exposes them to the utmost penaltys, if upon their own heads, or a command from the King, they should presume to give a Sentence, without or contrary to a Ver∣dict; and no pretensions to a power of interpreting the Law can exempt them if they break it. The power also with which the Judges are en∣trusted, is but of a moderate extent, and to be executed <HI>bona side.</HI> Preva∣rications are capital, as they prov'd to <HI>Tresilian, Empson, Dudley,</HI> and many others. Nay even in special Verdicts, the Judges are only assist∣ants to the Jurys who find it specially, and the Verdict is from them; tho the Judges having heard the point argu'd, declare the sense of the Law thereupon. Wherefore if I should grant that the King might personally assist in judgments, his work could only be to prevent frauds, and by the advice of the Judges to see that the Laws be duly executed, or perhaps to inspect their behaviour. If he has more than this, it must be by vir∣tue of his politick capacity, in which he is understood to be always pre∣sent in the principal Courts, where Justice is always done whether he who wears the Crown be young or old, wise or ignorant, good or bad, or whether he like or dislike what is done.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="347"/>
Moreover, as Governments are instituted for the obtaining of Justice, and the King is in a great measure entrusted with the power of executing it, 'tis probable that the Law would have requir'd his presence in the distribution, if there had bin but one Court; that at the same time he could be present in more than one; that it were certain he would be guilty of no miscarriages; that all miscarriages were to be punish'd in him as well as in the Judges; or that it were certain he should always be a man of such wisdom, industry, experience and integrity, as to be an assist∣ance to, and a watch over those who are appointed for the administra∣tion of Justice. But there being many Courts sitting at the same time of equal Authority, in several places far distant from each other; it being impossible for the King to be present in all; there being no manner of assurance that the same or greater miscarriages may not be committed in his presence than in his absence, by himself than others; no opportunity of punishing every delict in him, without bringing the Nation into such disorder, as may be of more prejudice to the publick than an injury done to a private man; the Law which intends to obviate offences, or to pu∣nish such as cannot be obviated, has directed, that those men should be chosen who are most knowing in it, imposes an Oath upon them, not to be diverted from the due course of justice by fear or favor, hopes or re∣ward, particularly by any command from the King; and appoints the severest punishments for them if they prove false to God and their Country.</P>
<P>If any man think that the words cited from <HI>Bracton</HI> by our Author upon the question, <HI>Quis primo &amp; principaliter possit &amp; debeat judicare, &amp;c. Sciendum est quod Rex &amp; non alius, si solus ad haec sufficere possit; cum ad hoc per virtutem Sacramenti teneatur,</HI> are contrary to what I have said, I desire the context may be consider'd, that his opinion may be truly un∣derstood, tho the words taken simply and nakedly may be enough for my purpose. For 'tis ridiculous to infer that the King has a right of doing any thing, upon a supposition that 'tis impossible for him to do it. He therefore who says the King cannot do it, says it must be done by others, or not at all. But having already prov'd that the King, merely as King, has none of the qualitys requir'd for judging all or any cases, and that many Kings have all the defects of age and person that render men most unable and unfit to give any Sentence; we may conclude, without con∣tradicting <HI>Bracton,</HI> that no King as King has a power of judging, be∣cause some of them are utterly unable and unfit to do it; and if any one has such a power, it must be confer'd upon him by those who think him able and fit to perform that work. When <HI>Filmer</HI> finds such a man, we must inquire into the extent of that power which is given to him; but this would be nothing to his general proposition, for he himself would hardly have infer'd, that because a power of judging in some cases was confer'd upon one Prince on account of his fitness and ability, therefore all of 'em, however unfit and unable, have a power of deciding all cases. Besides, if he believe <HI>Bracton,</HI> this power of judging is not inherent in the King, but incumbent upon him by virtue of his Oath, which our Author endeavours to enervate and annul. But as that Oath is grounded upon the Law, and the Law cannot presume impossibilitys and absurditys, it cannot intend, and the Oath cannot require, that a man should do that which he is unable and unfit to do. Many Kings are unfit to judg causes, the Law cannot therefore intend they should do it. The Context also shews, that this imagination of the King's judging all causes, if he
<PB N="340" REF="348"/>
 could, is merely chimerical: for <HI>Bracton</HI> says in the same Chapter, that <HI>the power of the King is the Power of the Law;</HI> that is, that he has no power but by the Law. And the Law that aims at justice, cannot make it to depend upon the uncertain humor of a Child, a Woman, or a foolish Man; for by that means it would destroy it self. The Law can∣not therefore give any such power, and the King cannot have it.</P>
<P>If it be said that all Kings are not so; that some are of mature age, wise, just and good; or that the question is not what is good for the Subject, but what is glorious to the King, and that he must not lose his right tho the People perish; I answer, first, that whatsoever belongs to Kings as Kings, belongs to all Kings: this Power of judging cannot be∣long to all for the Reasons above-mention'd: it cannot therefore belong to any as King, nor without madness be granted to any, till he has given testimony of such Wisdom, Experience, Diligence and Goodness, as is requir'd for so great a work. It imports not what his Ancestors were; Vertues are not entail'd; and it were less improper for the Heirs of <HI>Hales</HI> and <HI>Harvey,</HI> to pretend that the Clients and Patients of their Ancestors should depend upon their advice in matters of Law and Physick, than for the Heirs of a great and wise Prince to pretend to Powers given on account of vertue, if they have not the same talents for the performance of the works requir'd.</P>
<P>Common sense declares, that Governments are instituted, and Judica∣tures erected for the obtaining of justice. The Kings Bench was not establish'd that the Chief Justice should have a great Office, but that the oppressed should be reliev'd, and right done. The Honor and Profit he receives, comes in as it were by accident, as the rewards of his service, if he rightly perform his duty: but he may as well pretend he is there for his own sake, as the King. God did not set up <HI>Moses</HI> or <HI>Joshua,</HI> that they might glory in having six hundred thousand men under their command, but that they might lead the People into the Land they were to possess: that is, they were not for themselves, but for the People; and the glory they acquir'd was by rightly performing the end of their institution. Even our Author is oblig'd to confess this, when he says, that the King's Prerogative is instituted for the good of those that are un∣der it. 'Tis therefore for them that he enjoys it, and it can no otherwise subsist than in concurrence with that end. He also yields that <HI>the safety of the People is the supreme Law.</HI> The right therefore that the King has must be conformable and subordinate to it. If any one therefore set up an interest in himself that is not so, he breaks this supreme Law; he dos not live and reign for his People but for himself, and by departing from the end of his institution destroys it: and if <HI>Aristotle</HI> (to whom our Au∣thor seems to have a great deference) deserves credit, such a one ceases to be a King, and becomes a Tyrant; he who ought to have bin the best of men is turn'd into the worst; and he who is recommended to us under the name of a Father, becomes a publick Enemy to the People. The question therefore is not, what is good for the King, but what is good for the People, and he can have no right repugnant to them.</P>
<P><HI>Bracton</HI> is not more gentle. <HI>The King,</HI> says he, <HI>is oblig'd by his Oath, to the utmost of his power, to preserve the Church, and the Christian World in peace; to hinder rapine, and all manner of iniquity; to cause justice and mercy to be observ'd: He has no power but from the Law: that only is to be taken for Law, quod recte fuerit definitum:</HI> he is therefore to cause justice to be done according to that rule, and not to pervert it for his own plea∣sure,
<PB N="341" REF="349"/>
profit or glory. He may chuse Judges also, not such as will be subservient to his will, but <HI>Viros sapientes, timentes Deum, in quibus est</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bract. l. 3. c. 10.</NOTE><HI>veritas eloquiorum, &amp; qui oderunt avaritiam.</HI> Which proves that Kings and their Officers do not possess their places for themselves, but for the People, and must be such as are fit and able to perform the dutys they undertake. The mischievous fury of those who assume a power above their abilitys, is well represented by the known fable of <HI>Phaeton:</HI> they think they desire fine things for themselves when they seek their own ruin. In conformity to this the same <HI>Bracton</HI> says, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si quis minus sapiens &amp; indoctus, sedem judicandi &amp; honestatem judicandi sibi praesumserit, exalto corruit, &amp;c. &amp; perinde <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit ac si gladium poneret in manu furentis. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>If any man who is un∣skilful assume the seat of justice, he falls as from a Precipice, &amp;c. and 'tis the same thing as if a sword be put into the hand of a mad man;</HI> which can∣not but affect the King as well as those who are chosen by him. If he neglect the functions of his Office, <HI>he dos unjustly, and becomes the Vice∣gerent of the Devil; for he is the Minister of him whose works he dos.</HI> This is <HI>Bracton</HI>'s opinion: but desiring to be a more gentle Interpreter of the Law, I only wish that Princes would consider the end of their institution; endeavour to perform it; measure their own abilitys; content themselves with that power which the Laws allow, and abhor those Wretches who by flattery and lies endeavour to work upon their frailest Passions, by which means they draw upon 'em that hatred of the People, which fre∣quently brings them to destruction.</P>
<P>Tho <HI>Ʋlpian</HI>'s words, <HI>Princeps legibus non tenetur,</HI> be granted to have bin true in fact, with relation to the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, in the time when he liv'd; yet they can conclude nothing against us. The Liberty of <HI>Rome</HI> had bin overthrown long before by the power of the Sword, and the Law render'd subservient to the will of the Usurpers. They were not <HI>English</HI>-men, but <HI>Romans,</HI> who lost the Battels of <HI>Pharsalia</HI> and <HI>Philippi:</HI> The Carcases of their Senators, not ours, were expos'd to the Wolves and Vulturs: <HI>Pompeius, Scipio, Lentulus, Afranius, Petreius, Cato, Cassius</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> were defenders of the <HI>Roman,</HI> not the <HI>English</HI> Liberty; and that of their Country, not ours, could only be lost by their defeat. Those who were destroy'd by the Proscriptions, left <HI>Rome,</HI> not <HI>England</HI> to be enslav'd. If the best had gain'd the victory, it could have bin no advantage to us, and their overthrow can be no prejudice. Every Na∣tion is to take care of their own Laws; and whether any one has had the Wisdom, Vertue, Fortune and Power to defend them or not, concerns only themselves. The Examples of great and good men acting freely deserve consideration, but they only perish by the ill success of their de∣signs; and whatsoever is afterwards done by their subdu'd Posterity ought to have no other effect upon the rest of the world, than to admonish them so to join in the defence of their Libertys, as never to be brought under the necessity of acting by the command of one, to the prejudice of themselves and their Country. If the <HI>Roman</HI> greatness persuade us to put an extraordinary value upon what pass'd among them, we ought rather to examin what they did, said, or thought when they enjoy'd that Liberty which was the Mother and Nurse of their Vertue, than what they suffer'd, or were forc'd to say, when fallen under that Slavery which produc'd all manner of corruption, and made them the most base and miserable People of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="350"/>
 For what concerns us, the Actions of our Ancestors resemble those of the antient rather than the later <HI>Romans:</HI> tho our Government be not the same with theirs in form, yet it is in principle; and if we are not de∣generated, we shall rather desire to imitate the <HI>Romans</HI> in the time of their vertue, glory, power and felicity, than what they were in that of their slavery, vice, shame and misery. In the best times, when <HI>the Laws were more powerful than the commands of men,</HI> fraud was accounted a crime so detestable as not to be imputed to any but Slaves; and he who had sought a power above the Law under color of interpreting it, would have bin expos'd to scorn, or greater punishments, if any can be greater than the just scorn of the best men. And as neither the <HI>Romans,</HI> nor any people of the world, have better defended their libertys than the <HI>English</HI> Nation when any attempt has bin made to oppress them by force, they ought to be no less careful to preserve them from the more dangerous efforts of fraud and falshood.</P>
<P>Our Ancestors were certainly in a low condition in the time of <HI>William</HI> the First: Many of their best men had perish'd in the Civil Wars or with <HI>Harold:</HI> their valor was great, but rough, and void of skill: The <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> by frequent Expeditions into <HI>France, Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> had added sub∣tilty to the boisterous violence of their native climate: <HI>William</HI> had en∣gag'd his Faith, but broke it, and turn'd the power with which he was entrusted to the ruin of those that had trusted him. He destroy'd many worthy men, carry'd others into <HI>Normandy,</HI> and thought himself Master of all. He was crafty, bold, and elated with Victory; but the resolu∣tion of a brave People was invincible. When their Laws and Libertys were in danger, they resolved to die or to defend them, and made him see he could no otherwise preserve his Crown and Life than by the per∣formance of his Oath, and accomplishing the ends of his Election. They neither took him to be the giver or interpreter of their Laws, and would not suffer him to violate those of their Ancestors. In this way they always continu'd; and tho perhaps they might want skill to fall upon the surest and easiest means of restraining the lusts of Princes, yet they main∣tain'd their rights so well, that the wisest Princes seldom invaded them; and the success of those who were so foolish to attempt it was such, as may justly deter others from following their unprosperous Examples. We have had no King since <HI>William</HI> the First more hardy than <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th,</HI> and yet he so intirely acknowledg'd the power of making, changing and repealing Laws to be in the Parliament, as never to attempt any extraor∣dinary thing otherwise than by their Authority. It was not he, but the Parliament, that dissolv'd the Abbys: He did not take their Lands to him∣self, but receiv'd what the Parliament thought fit to give him: He did not reject the Supremacy of the Pope, nor assume any other power in spi∣ritual matters, than the Parliament confer'd upon him. The intricacys of his Marriages, and the legitimation of his Children were settled by the same Power: At least one of his Daughters could not inherit the Crown upon any other Title; they who gave him a power to dispose of the Crown by will, might have given it to his Groom; and he was too haughty to ask it from them, if he had it in himself, which he must have had, if the Laws and Judicatures had bin in his hand.</P>
<P>This is farther evidenc'd by what pass'd in the Tower between Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Moor</HI> and <HI>Rich</HI> the King's Sollicitor, who asking, If it would not be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Herberts<HI>'s</HI> Hen. 8<HI>th.</HI></NOTE>treason to oppose <HI>Richard Rich,</HI> if the Parliament should make him King, <HI>Moor</HI> said that was <HI>Casus levis;</HI> for the Parliament could make and depose
<PB N="343" REF="351"/>
Kings as they thought fit; and then (as more conducing to his own case) ask'd <HI>Rich</HI> if the Parliament should enact <HI>that God should not be God,</HI> whe∣ther such as did not submit should be esteem'd Traytors? 'Tis evident that a man of the acuteness and learning of Sir <HI>Tho. Moor</HI> would not have made use of such an Argument to avoid the necessity of obeying what the Parliament had ordain'd, by shewing his Case to be of a nature far above the power of man, unless it had bin confest by all men that the Parliament could do whatsoever lay within the reach of human power. This may be enough to prove that the King cannot have a power over the Law; and if he has it not, the power of interpreting Law is absurdly attributed to him, since it is founded upon a supposition that he can make them, which is false.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXVII. <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was not the Original, but a Declaration of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Libertys. The King's Power is not restrain'd, but created by that and other Laws; and the Nation that made them can only cor∣rect the defects of them.</HEAD>
<P>I Agree with our Author that <HI>Magna Charta was not made to restrain the absolute Authority;</HI> for no such thing was in being or pretended (the folly of such visions seeming to have bin reserv'd to compleat the misfortune and ignominy of our age) but it was to assert the native and original Libertys of our Nation by the confession of the King then be∣ing, that neither he nor his Successors should any way encroach upon them: and it cannot be said that the power of Kings is diminish'd by that or any other Law; for as they are Kings only by Law, the Law may confer power upon one in particular, or upon him and his Successors, but can take nothing from them, because they have nothing except what is given to them. But as that which the Law gives, is given by those who make the Law, they only are capable of judging, whether he to whom they gave it, do well or ill imploy that power, and consequently are only fit to correct the defects that may be found in it. Therefore tho I should confess that faults may be found in many Statutes, and that the whole bo∣dy of them is greatly defective, it will not follow that the compendious way of referring all to the will of the King should be taken. But what defects soever may be in our Law, the disease is not so great to re∣quire extreme remedys, and we may hope for a cheaper cure. Our Law may possibly have given away too much from the People, and provided only insufficient defences of our Libertys against the incroachments of bad Princes; but none who are not in judgment and honesty like to our Au∣thor, can propose for a remedy to the evils that proceed from the error of giving too much, the resignation of all the rest to them. And whatever he says, 'tis evident that he knows this to be true, tho when he denys that the power of King can be restrain'd by Acts of Parliament, he endeavours to take advantage of such clauses as were either fraudulently inserted by the King's Officers, who till the days of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth for the most part had the penning of the publick Acts, or thro negligence did not fully ex∣plain the intentions of the Legislators; which would be to no purpose if all were put into the hands of the King by a general Law from God, that
<PB N="344" REF="352"/>
 no human power could diminish or enlarge; and as his last shift would obliquely put all into the power of the King, by giving him a right of inter∣preting the Law, and judging such cases as are not clearly decided; which would be equally impertinent, if he had openly and plainly a right of de∣termining all things according to his will.</P>
<P>But what defect soever may be in any Statutes, no great inconve∣niencys could probably ensue, if that for annual Parliaments was observ'd, as of right it ought to be. Nothing is more unlikely, than that a great Assembly of eminent and chosen men should make a Law evidently de∣structive to their own designs; and no mischief that might emerge upon the discovery of a mistake, could be so extreme that the cure might not be defer'd till the meeting of the Parliament, or at least forty days (in which time the King may call one) if that which the Law has fix'd seem to be too long. If he fails of this, he performs not his trust; and he that would reward such a breach of it with a vast and uncontrolable power, may be justly thought equal in madness to our Author, who by forbidding us to examin the titles of Kings, and enjoining an intire veneration of the power, by what means soever obtain'd, encourages the worst of men to murder the best of Princes, with an assurance that if they prosper they shall enjoy all the honors and advantages that this World can afford.</P>
<P>Princes are not much more beholden to him for the haughty language he puts into their mouths, it having bin observ'd that the worst are al∣ways most ready to use it; and their extravagances having bin often cha∣stis'd by Law, sufficiently proves, that their power is not deriv'd from a higher original than the Law of their own Countrys.</P>
<P>If it were true, that the answer sometimes given by Kings to Bills pre∣sented for their Assent, did, as our Author says, amount to a denial, it could only shew that they have a negative voice upon that which is agreed by the Parliament, and is far from a power of acting by themselves, be∣ing only a check upon the other parts of the Government. But indeed it is no more than an elusion; and he that dos by art obliquely elude, confesses he has not a right absolutely to refuse. 'Tis natural to Kings, especially to the worst, to scrue up their Authority to the height; and nothing can more evidently prove the defect of it, than the necessity of having recourse to such pitiful evasions, when they are unwilling to do that which is re∣quir'd. But if I should grant that the words import a denial, and that (notwithstanding those of the Coronation Oath, <HI>Quas vulgus elegerit)</HI> they might deny; no more could be infer'd from thence, than that they are en∣trusted with a power equal in that point, to that of either House, and can∣not be supreme in our Author's sense, unless there were in the same State at the same time three distinct supreme and absolute Powers, which is absurd.</P>
<P>His cases relating to the proceedings of the Star Chamber and Council-Table, do only prove that some Kings have incroach'd upon the rights of the Nation, and bin suffer'd till their excesses growing to be extreme, they turn'd to the ruin of the Ministers that advis'd them, and sometimes of the Kings themselves. But the Jurisdiction of the Council having bin re∣gulated by the Statute of 17 <HI>Car.</HI> 1. and the Star-Chamber more lately abolish'd, they are nothing to our dispute.</P>
<P>Such as our Author usually impute to Treason and Rebellion the changes that upon these occasions have ensu'd; but all impartial men do not only justify them, but acknowledg that all the Crowns of <HI>Europe</HI> are at this day enjoy'd by no other title than such Acts solemnly perform'd by the respe∣ctive
<PB N="345" REF="353"/>
Nations, who either disliking the Person that pretended to the Crown (tho next in blood) or the Government of the present Possessor, have thought fit to prefer another Person or Family. They also say, as that no Government can be so perfect but some defect may be originally in it, or af∣terwards introduc'd, none can subsist unless they be from time to time re∣duc'd to their first integrity, by such an exertion of the power of those for whose sake they were instituted, as may plainly shew them to be subject to no power under Heaven, but may do whatever appears to be for their own good. And as the safety of all Nations consists in rightly placing and measuring this Power, such have bin found always to prosper who have given it to those from whom Usurpations were least to be fear'd, who have bin least subject to be aw'd, cheated or corrupted; and who having the greatest interest in the Nation, were most concern'd to preserve its power, liberty and welfare. This is the greatest trust that can be repos'd in men. This power was by the <HI>Spartans</HI> given to the <HI>Ephori</HI> and the Senat of twenty eight; in <HI>Venine</HI> to that which they call <HI>Concilio de Pre∣gadi;</HI> in <HI>Germany, Spain, France, Swedeland, Denmark, Poland, Hungary, Bohemia, Scotland, England,</HI> and generally all the Nations that have liv'd under the <HI>Gothick</HI> Polity, it has bin in their General Assemblys, under the names of Diets, Cortez, Parliaments, Senats, and the like. But in what hands soever it is, the power of making, abrogating, changing, correct∣ing and intepreting Laws, has bin in the same; Kings have bin rejected or depos'd; the Succession of the Crown settled, regulated or chang'd: and I defy any man to shew me one King amongst all the Nations abovemen∣tion'd, that has any right to the Crown he wears, unless such acts are good.</P>
<P>If this power be not well plac'd, or rightly proportion'd to that which is given to other Magistrats, the State must necessarily fall into great dis∣orders, or the must violent and dangerous means must be frequently us'd to preserve their Liberty. <HI>Sparta</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> have rarely bin put to that trouble, because the Senats were so much above the Kings and Dukes in power, that they could without difficulty bring them to reason. The <HI>Gothick</HI> Kings in <HI>Spain</HI> never ventur'd to dispute with the Nobility; and <HI>Witza</HI> and <HI>Rodrigo</HI> expos'd the Kingdom as a prey to the <HI>Moors,</HI> rather by weakning it thro the neglect of Military disciplin, join'd to their own ignorance and cowardice, and by evil example bringing the youth to re∣semble them in leudness and baseness, than by establishing in themselves a power above the Law. But in <HI>England</HI> our Ancestors, who seem to have had some such thing in their eye, as balancing the powers, by a fatal mi∣stake plac'd usually so much in the hands of the King, that whensoever he happen'd to be bad, his extravagances could not be represt without great danger. And as this has in several ages cost the Nation a vast proportion of generous blood, so 'tis the cause of our present difficultys, and threatens us with more, but can never deprive usof the rights we inherit from our fathers.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVIII. The English Nation has always bin govern'd by it self, or its Representatives.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING prov'd that the People of <HI>England</HI> have never acknow∣ledg'd any other human Law than their own, and that our Parlia∣ments having the power of making and abrogating Laws, they only can
<PB N="346" REF="354"/>
 interpret them and decide hard cases, it plainly appears there can be no truth in our Author's assertion, That <HI>the King is the Author, Corrector and Moderator of both Statute and Common Law:</HI> and nothing can be more frivolous than what he adds, that <HI>neither of them can be a diminution of that natural power which Kings have over their People as fathers;</HI> in as much as the differences between paternal and monarchical Power (as he asserts it) are vast and irreconcilable in principle and practice, as I have prov'd at large in the former parts of this Work.</P>
<P><HI>But lest we should be too proud of the honor he is pleas'd to do to our Parliaments by making use of their Authority, he says,</HI> We are first to re∣member that till the Conquest <HI>(which name for the glory of our Nation he gives to the coming in of the</HI> Normans) there could be no Parliament as∣sembled of the General States, because we cannot learn that until those days it was intirely united in one. <HI>Secondly he doubts,</HI> Whether the Parlia∣ment in the time of the <HI>Saxons</HI> were compos'd of the Nobility and Clergy, or whether the Commons were also call'd; <HI>but concludes,</HI> there could be no Knights of any Shires, because there were no Shires. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That <HI>Henry</HI> the First caus'd the Commons first to assemble Knights and Burgesses of their own chusing; <HI>and would make this to be an Act of grace and favor from that King: but adds, that</HI> it had bin more for the honor of Parliaments, if a King whose title to the Crown had bin better, had bin the Author of the form of it.</P>
<P>In answer to the first, I do not think my self oblig'd to insist upon the name or form of the Parliament; for the Authority of a Magistracy pro∣ceeds not from the number of years that it has continu'd, but the recti∣tude of the Institution, and the Authority of those that instituted it. The power of <HI>Saul, David</HI> and <HI>Jeroboam</HI> was the same with that which be∣long'd to the last Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah.</HI> The Authority of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Consuls, Dictators, Pretors and Tribuns, was the same as soon as it was establish'd; was as legal and just as that of the Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which is said to have continu'd above three thousand years. For as time can make nothing lawful or just, that is not so of it self (tho men are unwilling to change that which has pleas'd their Ancestors, unless they discover great inconveniences in it) that which a People dos rightly esta∣blish for their own good, is of as much force the first day, as continuance can ever give to it: and therefore in matters of the greatest importance, wise and good men do not so much inquire what has bin, as what is good and ought to be; for that which of it self is evil, by continuance is made worse, and upon the first opportunity is justly to be abolish'd. But if that Liberty in which God created man, can receive any strength from continuance, and the rights of <HI>Englishmen</HI> can be render'd more unque∣stionable by prescription, I say that the Nations whose rights we inherit, have ever enjoy'd the Libertys we claim, and always exercis'd them in go∣verning themselves popularly, or by such Representatives as have bin insti∣tuted by themselves, from the time they were first known in the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Britans</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> lay so long hid in the obscurity that accom∣panys barbarism, that 'tis in vain to seek what was done by either in any Writers more antient than <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus.</HI> The first describes the <HI>Bri∣tans</HI> to have bin a fierce People zealous for Liberty, and so obstinately va∣liant in the defence of it, that tho they wanted skill, and were overpower'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> their Country could no otherwise be subdu'd, than by the slaughter of all the Inhabitants able to bear arms. He calls them a free People, in as much as they were not like the <HI>Gauls,</HI> govern'd by Laws
<PB N="347" REF="355"/>
made by the great Men, but by the People. In his time they chose <HI>Cas∣sivellaunus,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Caractatus, Arviragus, Galgacus,</HI> and others to command them in their wars, but they retain'd the Government in them∣selves. That no force might be put upon them, they met arm'd in their general Assemblys; and tho the smaller matters were left to the determi∣nation of the Chief men chosen by themselves for that purpose, they re∣serv'd the most important (amongst which the chusing of those men was one) to themselves. When the <HI>Romans</HI> had brought them low, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inter instrumenta servitutis reges habuere. <BIBL>C. Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE>they set up certain Kings to govern such as were within their Territorys: but those who defended themselves by the natural strength of their situation, or retir'd into the North, or the Islands, were still govern'd by their own Customs, and were never acquainted with domestick or foreign slavery▪ The <HI>Saxons,</HI> from whom we chiefly derive our Original and Manners, were no less lovers of Liberty, and better understood the ways of defend∣ing it. They were certainly the most powerful and valiant People of <HI>Germany;</HI> and what the <HI>Germans</HI> perform'd under <HI>Ariovistus, Arminius</HI> and <HI>Maroboduus,</HI> shews both their force and their temper. If ever fear enter'd into the heart of <HI>Cesar,</HI> it seems to have bin when he was to deal with <HI>Ariovistus.</HI> The advantages that the brave <HI>Germanicus</HI> obtain'd a∣gainst <HI>Arminius,</HI> were at least thought equal to the greatest Victorys that had bin gain'd by any <HI>Roman</HI> Captain; because these Nations fought not for riches, or any instruments of Luxury or Pleasure, which they despis'd, but for Liberty. This was the Principle in which they liv'd, as appears by their words and actions; so that <HI>Arminius,</HI> when his brother <HI>Flavius,</HI> who serv'd the <HI>Romans,</HI> boasted of the increase of his pay, and the marks of honor he had receiv'd, in scorn call'd them the <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Vilis servi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ii pramia. <BIBL>Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>rewards of the vilest servitude:</HI> but when he himself endeavour'd to usurp a power over the Liberty of his Country which he had so bravely defended, he was kill'd by those he would have opprest. <HI>Tacitus</HI> farther describing the nature of the <HI>Germans,</HI> shews that the <HI>Romans</HI> had run greater hazards from them than from the <HI>Samnites, Carthaginians</HI> and <HI>Parthians,</HI> and attributes their Bravery to the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quippe gravior est Arsacis regno Germanorum Libertas.</NOTE>Liberty they enjoy'd; for they are, says he, neither <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pti oneribus &amp; collationibus, &amp; tantum in usum pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liorum seposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i, velut tela &amp; arma bellis reservantur.</NOTE>ex∣hausted by Tributes, nor vex'd by Publicans: and lest this Liberty should be violated, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">De minoribus principes consultant, de majoribus omnes. <BIBL><HI>C.

Their Kings and Princes had no other power than what was confer'd upon them by these <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Ut turbae placuit considunt armati, silentium per <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acerdotes, quibus tum coercendi jus est, im∣peratur.

<P><PB N="348" REF="356"/>
 'Tis as easily prov'd that the <HI>Saxons</HI> or <HI>Angli,</HI> from whom we descend, were eminent among those, whose power, vertue, and love to Liberty the abovemention'd Historian so highly extols, in as much as besides what he says in general of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> he names the <HI>Angli;</HI> describes their ha∣bitation near the <HI>Elb,</HI> and their religious worship of the Goddess <HI>Erthum,</HI> or the Earth, celebrated in an Island lying in the mouth of that River, thought to be <HI>Heyligland;</HI> in resemblance of which a small one lying over against <HI>Berwick,</HI> is call'd Holy Island. If they were free in their own Country, they must have bin so when they came hither. The manner of their coming shews they were more likely to impose, than sub∣mit to slavery; and if they had not the name of Parliament, it was because they did not speak <HI>French;</HI> or, not being yet join'd with the <HI>Normans,</HI> they had not thought fit to put their Affairs into that method: but having the root of Power and Liberty in themselves, they could not but have a right of establishing the one in such a form as best pleas'd them, for the preservation of the other.</P>
<P>This being, as I suppose, undeniable, it imports not whether the As∣semblys in which the Supreme Power of each Nation did reside, were frequent or rare; compos'd of many or few Persons, sitting altogether in one place, or in more; what name they had; or whether every Free man did meet and vote in his own person, or a few were delegated by many. For they who have a Right inherent in themselves, may resign it to others; and they who can give a Power to others, may exercise it themselves, unless they recede from it by their own act; for it is only matter of convenience, of which they alone can be the Judges, because 'tis for themselves only that they judg. If this were not so, it would be very prejudicial to Kings: for 'tis certain that <HI>Cassivellaunus, Caractatus, Arvi∣ragus, Galgacus, Hengist, Horsa,</HI> and others amongst the <HI>Britans</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> what name soever may have bin abusively given to them, were only temporary Magistrats chosen upon occasion of present Wars; but we know of no time in which the <HI>Britans</HI> had not their Great Council to determin their most important Affairs: and the <HI>Saxons</HI> in their own Coun∣try had their Councils, where all were present, and in which <HI>Taci∣tus</HI> assures us they dispatch'd their greatest Business. These were the same with the <HI>Micklegemots</HI> which they afterwards held here, and might have bin call'd by the same name, if <HI>Tacitus</HI> had spoken <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>If a People therefore have not a power to create at any time a Magi∣stracy which they had not before, none could be created at all, for no Magistracy is eternal: And if for the validity of the Constitution it be necessary, that the beginning must be unknown, or that no other could have bin before it, the Monarchy amongst us cannot be establish'd up∣on any right; for tho our Ancestors had their Councils and Magistrats, as well here as in <HI>Germany,</HI> they had no Monarchs. This appears plain∣ly by the testimony of <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus;</HI> and our later Historys show, that as soon as the <HI>Saxons</HI> came into this Country, they had their <HI>Mickle∣gemots,</HI> which were general Assemblys of the Noble and Free men, who had in themselves the Power of the Nation: and tho when they in∣creas'd in numbers, they erected seven Kingdoms, yet every one re∣tain'd the same usage within it self. These Assemblys were evident∣ly the same in power with our Parliaments; and tho they differ'd in name or form, it matters not, for they who could act in the one, could not but have a power of instituting the other; that is, the same People that could meet together in their own Persons, and according to their
<PB N="349" REF="357"/>
own pleasure order all matters relating to themselves, whilst three or four Countys only were under one Government, and their numbers were not so great, or their habitation so far distant, that they might not meet al∣together without inconvenience, with the same Right might depute others to represent them, when being join'd in one, no place was capable of re∣ceiving so great a multitude, and that the Frontiers would have bin expos'd to the danger of foreign Invasions, if any such thing had bin practis'd.</P>
<P>But if the Authority of Parliaments, for many Ages representing the whole Nation, were less to be valu'd (as our Author insinuates) because they could not represent the whole, when it was not join'd in one Body, that of Kings must come to nothing; for there could be no one King over all, when the Nation was divided into seven distinct Governments: And 'tis most absurd to think that the Nation, which had seven Great Councils, or Micklegemots, at the same time they had seven Kingdoms, could not as well unite the seven Councils as the seven Kingdoms into one. 'Tis to as little purpose to say, that the Nation did not unite it self, but the several parcels came to be inherited by one; for that one could inherit no more from the others than what they had; and the seven being only Ma∣gistrats set up by the Micklegemots, &amp;c. the one must be also. And 'tis neither reasonable to imagin, nor possible to prove, that a fierce Nation, jealous of Liberty, and who had obstinately defended it in <HI>Germany</HI> a∣gainst all Invaders, should conquer this Country to enslave themselves, and purchase nothing by their Valor but that Servitude which they abhor'd; or be less free when they were united into one State, than they had bin when they were divided into seven; and least of all, that one man could first subdue his own People, and then all the rest, when by endeavouring to subdue his own, he had broken the Trust repos'd in him, and lost the Right confer'd upon him, and without them had not power to subdue any. But as it is my fate almost ever to dissent from our Author, I affirm, That the variety of Government, which is observ'd to have bin amongst the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who in some Ages were divided, in others united; sometimes under Captains, at other times under Kings; sometimes meeting personally in the Micklege∣mots, sometimes by their Delegats in the Wittenagemots, dos evi∣dently testify, that they order'd all things according to their own plea∣sure; which being the utmost Act of Liberty, it remain'd inviolable under all those changes, as we have already prov'd by the Examples of <HI>Offa, Ina, Alfred, Canutus, Edward,</HI> and other particular, as well as universal Kings: And we may be sure those of the <HI>Norman</HI> Race can have no more power, since they came in by the same way, and swore to govern by the same Laws.</P>
<P>2. I am no way concern'd in our Author's doubt, <HI>Whether Parlia∣ments did in those days consist of Nobility and Clergy; or, Whether the Commons were also call'd.</HI> For if it were true, as he asserts, that ac∣cording to the eternal Law of God and Nature, there can be no Go∣vernment in the World but that of an absolute Monarch, whose Sove∣reign Majesty can be diminish'd by no Law or Custom, there could be Parliaments, or other Magistracys, that did not derive their Power and Being from his Will. But having prov'd that the <HI>Saxons</HI> had their Gene∣ral Councils and Assemblys when they had no Kings; that by them Kings were made, and the greatest Affairs determin'd, whether they had Kings or not; it can be of no importance, whether in one or more Ages the Commons had a part in the Government, or not. For the same
<PB N="350" REF="358"/>
 Power that instituted a Parliament without them, might, when they thought fit, receive them into it: or rather, if they who had the Govern∣ment in their hands, did, for reasons known to themselves, recede from the exercise of it, they might resume it when they pleas'd.</P>
<P>Nevertheless it may be worth our pains to inquire what our Au∣thor means by Nobility. If such, as at this day by means of Patents ob∣tain'd for mony, or by favor, without any regard to Merit in the Persons or their Ancestors, are call'd Dukes, Marquesses, &amp;c. I give him leave to impute as late and base an Original to them as he pleases, without fear∣ing that the Rights of our Nation can thereby be impair'd; and am con∣tent, that if the King do not think fit to support the Dignity of his own Creatures, they may fall. But if by Noblemen we are to understand such as have bin ennobl'd by the vertues of their Ancestors, manifested in Services done to their Country, I say, that all Nations, amongst whom Vertue has bin esteem'd, have had a great regard to them and their Po∣sterity: and tho Kings, when they were made, have bin entrusted by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and other Nations, with a Power of ennobling those who by Services render'd to their Country might deserve that Honor, yet the Body of the Nobility was more antient than such; for it had bin equally impossible <HI>to take</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute sumere.</P>

Princes could not without breach of Trust con∣fer Honors upon those that did not deserve them; which is so true, that this practice was objected as the greatest crime against † <HI>Vortigern,</HI> the last and the worst of the <HI>British</HI> Kings: and tho he might pre∣tend (according to such cavils as are usually in our time) that the judg∣ment of those matters was refer'd to him; yet the World judg'd of his Crimes, and when he had render'd himself odious to God and Men by them, he perish'd in them, and brought destruction upon his Country that had suffer'd them too long.</P>
<P>As among the <HI>Turks,</HI> and most of the Eastern Tyrannys, there is no Nobility, and no man has any considerable advantage above the common People, unless by the immediate favor of the Prince; so in all the legal Kingdoms of the North, the strength of the Government has always bin plac'd in the Nobility; and no better defence has bin found against the en∣croachments of ill Kings, than by setting up an Order of Men, who by holding large Territorys, and having great numbers of Tenants and De∣pendents, might be able to restrain the exorbitances, that either the Kings or the Commons might run into. For this end <HI>Spain, Germany, France, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> were almost wholly di∣vided into Lordships under several names, by which every particular Pos∣sessor ow'd Allegiance (that is, such an Obedience as the Law requires) to the King, and he reciprocally swore to perform that which the same Law exacted from him.</P>
<P>When these Nations were converted to the Christian Religion, they had a great veneration for the Clergy; and not doubting that the Men
<PB N="351" REF="359"/>
whom they esteem'd holy, would be just, thought their Libertys could not be better secur'd, than by joining those who had the direction of their Consciences, to the Noblemen who had the command of their Forces. This succeeded so well (in relation to the defence of the publick Rights) that in all the foremention'd States, the Bishops, Abbots, &amp;c. were no less zealous or bold in defending the publick Liberty, than the best and greatest of the Lords: And if it were true, that things being thus establish'd, the Commons did neither personally, nor by their Representatives, enter into the General Assemblys, it could be of no advantage to Kings; for such a Power as is abovemention'd, is equally inconsistent with the absolute Sove∣reignty of Kings, if plac'd in the Nobility and Clergy, as if the Commons had a part. If the King has all, no other Man, nor number of Men can have any. If the Nobility and Clergy have the power, the Commons may have their share also. But I affirm, that those whom we now call Commons, have always had a part in the Government, and their place in the Councils that manag'd it; for if there was a distinction, it must have bin by Patent, Birth, or Tenure.</P>
<P>As for Patents, we know they began long after the coming of the <HI>Nor∣mans;</HI> and those that now have them cannot pretend to any advantage on ac∣count of Birth or Tenure, beyond many of those who have them not. Nay, besides the several Branches of the Familys that now enjoy the most an∣tient Honors, which consequently are as noble as they, and some of them of the elder Houses, we know many that are now call'd Commoners, who in antiquity and eminency are no way inferior to the chief of the titular Nobility: and nothing can be more absurd, than to give a Prerogative of Birth to <HI>Cr-v-n, T-ft-n, H-de, B-nn-t, Osb-rn,</HI> and others, before the <HI>Cliftons, Hampdens, Courtneys, Pelhams, St. Johns, Baintons, Wilbrahams, Hungerfords,</HI> and many others. And if the Tenures of their Estates be consider'd, they have the same, and as antient as any of those who go un∣der the names of Duke, or Marquess. I forbear to mention the sordid ways of attaining to Titles in our days; but whoever will take the pains to examin them, shall find that they rather defile than ennoble the posses∣sors. And whereas Men are truly ennobl'd only by Vertue, and respect is due to such as are descended from those who have bravely serv'd their Country, because it is presum'd (till they shew the contrary) that they will resemble their Ancestors, these modern Courtiers, by their Names and Titles, frequently oblige us to call to mind such things as are not to be men∣tion'd without blushing. Whatever the antient Noblemen of <HI>England</HI> were, we are sure they were not such as these. And tho it should be confest that no others than Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, and Barons, had their places in the Councils mention'd by <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> or in the great Assemblys of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> it could be of no advantage to such as are now call'd by those names. They were the titles of Offices confer'd upon those, who did and could best conduct the People in time of War; give Coun∣sel to the King; administer Justice, and perform other publick dutys; but were never made hereditary except by abuse; much less were they sold for mony, or given as recompences of the vilest services. If the an∣tient Order be totally inverted, and the ends of its Institution perverted, they who from thence pretend to be distinguish'd from other men, must build their Claim upon something very different from Antiquity.</P>
<P>This being sufficient (if I mistake not) to make it appear, That the antient Councils of our Nation did not consist of such as we now call Noblemen, it may be worth our pains to examin of what sort of men they
<PB N="352" REF="360"/>
 did consist: And tho I cannot much rely upon the credit of <HI>Camden,</HI> which he has forfeited by a great number of untruths, I will begin with him, because he is cited by our Author.

<P>If any man ask how the Nobility came to be so numerous; I answer, That the Northern Nations, who were perpetually in Arms, put a high esteem upon Military Valor; sought by conquest to acquire better Coun∣trys than their own; valu'd themselves according to the numbers of men they could bring into the field; and to distinguish them from Villains, call'd those Noblemen, who nobly defended and enlarg'd their Domini∣ons by War; and for a reward of their Services, in the division of Lands gain'd by conquest, they distributed to them Freeholds, under the obliga∣tion of continuing the same Service to their Country. This appears by the name of Knights Service, a Knight being no more than a Soldier, and a Knight's Fee no more than was sufficient to maintain one. 'Tis plain, that Knighthood was always esteem'd Nobility; so that no man, of what quality soever, thought a Knight inferior to him, and those of the highest birth could not act as Noblemen till they were knighted. Among the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> the cutting off the Hair (which being long was the mark of Knighthood) was accounted a degrading, and look'd upon to be so great a mark of Infamy, that he who had suffer'd it, could never bear any honor or office in the Commonwealth; and there was no dignity so high, but e∣very Knight was capable of it. There was no distinction of men above it, and even to this day <HI>Baron,</HI> or <HI>Varon,</HI> in their Language, signifys no more than <HI>Vir</HI> in Latin, which is not properly given to any man unless he be free. The like was in <HI>France</HI> till the coming in of the third race of Kings, in which time the 12 Peers (of whom 6 only were Laymen) were rais'd to a higher dignity, and the Commands annex'd made hereditary; but
<PB N="353" REF="361"/>
the honor of Knighthood was thereby no way diminish'd. Tho there were Dukes, Earls, Marquesses and Barons in the time of <HI>Froissart,</HI> yet he usually calls them Knights: And <HI>Philip de Commines,</HI> speaking of the most eminent men of his time, calls them good, wise or valiant Knights. Even to this day the name of Gentleman comprehends all that is rais'd above the common people: <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth usually call'd himself the first Gentleman in <HI>France;</HI> and 'tis an ordinary phrase among them, when they speak of a Gentleman of good Birth, to say, <HI>Il est noble comme le Roy, He is as noble as the King.</HI> In their General Assembly of Estates, <HI>The Chamber of the Noblesse,</HI> which is one of Three, is compos'd of the Deputys sent by the Gentry of every Province; and in the inquiry made about the Year 1668 concerning Nobility, no notice was taken of such as had assum'd the Titles of Earl, Marquess, Viscount, or Baron, but only of those who call'd themselves Gentlemen; and if they could prove that name to belong to them, they were left to use the other Titles as they pleas'd. When Duels were in fashion (as all know they were lately) no man except the Princes of the Blood, and Marechals of <HI>France,</HI> could with honor refuse a Challenge from any Gentleman: The first, because it was thought unfit, that he who might be King, should fight with a Subject to the danger of the Commonwealth, which might by that means be depriv'd of its Head: The others being by their Office Commanders of the Nobility, and Judges of all the Controversys relating to Honor that happen amongst them, cannot reasonably be brought into private Contests with any. In <HI>Denmark Nobleman</HI> and <HI>Gentleman</HI> is the same thing, and till the year 1660, they had the principal part of the Govern∣ment in their hands. When <HI>Charles Gustavus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> invaded <HI>Poland</HI> in the year 1655, 'tis said, that there were above three hundred thousand Gentlemen in Arms to resist him. This is the Nobility of that Country, Kings are chosen by them: Every one of them will say, as in <HI>France, He is noble as the King.</HI> The last King was a private man among them, not thought to have had more than four hundred pounds a year. He who now reigns was not at all above him in birth or estate, till he had rais'd himself by great services done for his Country in many wars; and there was not one Gentleman in the Nation who might not have bin chosen as well as he, if it had pleas'd the Assembly that did it.</P>
<P>This being the Nobility of the Northern Nations, and the true Baro∣nage of <HI>England,</HI> 'tis no wonder that they were call'd <HI>Nobiles,</HI> the most eminent among them <HI>Magnates, Principes, Proceres;</HI> and so numerous that they were esteem'd to be <HI>Multitudo infinita.</HI> One place was hardly able to contain them; and the inconveniences of calling them all together appear'd to be so great, that in time they chose rather to meet by Repre∣sentatives, than every one in his own person. The power therefore re∣maining in them, it matters not what method they observ'd in the execu∣tion. They who had the substance in their hands, might give it what form they pleas'd. Our Author sufficiently manifests his ignorance, in saying there could be no Knights of the Shires in the time of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> because there were no Shires; for the very word is <HI>Saxon,</HI> and we find the names of <HI>Barkshire, Wiltshire, Devonshire, Dorsetshire,</HI> and others most frequently in the writings of those times; and Dukes, Earls, Thanes or Aldermen, appointed to command the Forces, and look to the distribution of Justice in them. <HI>Selden</HI> cites <HI>Ingulphus</HI> for saying, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Selden<HI>'s Tit. of Honor,</HI> p. 2. c. 5.</NOTE><HI>Alfred was the first that chang'd the Provinces, &amp;c. into Countys:</HI> but re∣futes him, and proves that the distinction of the Land into Shires or
<PB N="354" REF="362"/>
 Countys (for Shire signify'd no more than the share or part committed to the care of the Earl or <HI>Comes)</HI> was far more antient. Whether the first divisions by the <HI>Saxons</HI> were greater or lesser than the Shires or Coun∣tys now are, is nothing to the question: they who made them to be as they were, could have made them greater or lesser as they pleas'd. And whether they did immediately, or some ages after that distinction, cease to come to their great Assemblys, and rather chuse to send their Deputys; or whether such Deputys were chosen by Countys, Citys and Boroughs, as in our days, or in any other manner, can be of no advantage or preju∣dice to the Cause that I maintain. If the power of the Nation, when it was divided into seven Kingdoms, or united under one, did reside in the Micklegemots or Wittenagemots; if these consisted of the Nobility and People, who were sometimes so numerous that no one place could well contain them; and if the preference given to the chief among them, was on account of the Offices they executed, either in relation to war or justice, which no man can deny, I have as much as serves for my pur∣pose. 'Tis indifferent to me, whether they were call'd Earls, Dukes, Aldermen, Herotoghs or Thanes; for 'tis certain that the titular Nobi∣lity now in mode amongst us has no resemblance to this antient Nobility of <HI>England.</HI> The novelty therefore is on the other side, and that of the worst sort; because by giving the name of Noblemen (which antiently belong'd to such as had the greatest interests in Nations, and were the supporters of their Liberty) to Court-creatures, who often have none, and either acquire their Honors by mony, or are prefer'd for servile and sometimes impure services render'd to the Person that reigns, or else for mischiefs done to their Country, the Constitution has bin wholly in∣verted, and the trust repos'd in the Kings (who in some measure had the disposal of Offices and Honors) misemploy'd. This is farther aggravated by appropriating the name of Noblemen solely to them; whereas the Nation having bin antiently divided only into Freemen or Noblemen (who were the same) and Villains; the first were, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> says of their An∣cestors the <HI>Germans,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exempti oneribus &amp; collationibus, &amp; tantum in usum praliorum repositi, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luti tela &amp; arma <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llis reservantur. <BIBL><HI>Corn.

Germ.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>exempted from burdens and contributions, and re∣serv'd like arms for the uses of war;</HI> whilst the others were little better than slaves, appointed to cultivate the Lands, or to other servile Offices. And I leave any reasonable man to judg, whether the latter condition be that of those we now call Commoners. Nevertheless, he that will be∣lieve the title of Noblemen still to belong to those only who are so by Patent, may guess how well our wars would be manag'd if they were left solely to such as are so by that title. If this be approv'd, his Majesty may do well with his hundred and fifty Noblemen, eminent in valor and military experience as they are known to be, to make such wars as may fall upon him, and leave the despis'd Commons under the name of Vil∣lains, to provide for themselves if the success do not answer his expecta∣tions. But if the Commons are as free as the Nobles, many of them in birth equal to the Patentees, in Estate superior to most of them; and that it is not only expected they should assist him in wars with their Persons and Purses, but acknowledg'd by all, that the strength and vertue of the Nation is in them it must be confest that they are true Noblemen of <HI>England,</HI> and that all the privileges antiently enjoy'd by such, must necessa∣rily belong to them, since they perform the Offices to which they were
<PB N="355" REF="363"/>
annex'd. This shews how the Nobility were justly said to be almost infinite in number, so that no one place was able to contain them. The <HI>Saxon</HI> Armys that came over into this Country to a wholesom and gene∣rative climat, might well increase in four or five ages to those vast num∣bers, as the <HI>Franks, Goths</HI> and others had done in <HI>Spain, France, Italy,</HI> and other parts: and when they were grown so numerous, they found themselves necessarily oblig'd to put the power into the hands of Repre∣sentatives chosen by themselves, which they had before exercis'd in their own persons. But these two ways differing rather in form than essentially, the one tending to Democracy, the other to Aristocracy, they are equally opposite to the absolute dominion of one man reigning for himself, and governing the Nation as his Patrimony; and equally assert the rights of the People to put the Government into such a form as best pleases them∣selves. This was sutable to what they had practis'd in their own Coun∣try; <HI>De minoribus consultant Principes, de majoribus omnes.</HI> Nay, even <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. de mor▪ Germ.</NOTE>these <HI>smaller matters</HI> cannot be said properly to relate to the King; for he is but one, and the word <HI>Principes</HI> is in the plural number, and can only signify such principal men, as the same Author says were chosen by the General Assemblys to do justice, &amp;c. and to each of them one hundred <HI>Comites</HI> join'd, not only to give advice, but authority to their actions.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Omnes</HI> spoken by a <HI>Roman,</HI> must likewise be understood as it was us'd by them, and imports all the Citizens, or such as made up the body of the Commonwealth. If he had spoken of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens</HI> whilst they remain'd free, he must have us'd the same word (because all those of whom the City consisted had votes) how great soever the num∣ber of slaves or strangers might have bin. The <HI>Spartans</HI> are rightly said to have gain'd, lost and recover'd the Lordship or Principality of <HI>Greece.</HI> They were all Lords in relation to their <HI>Helots;</HI> and so were the <HI>Dorians</HI> in relation to that sort of men, which under several names they kept, as the <HI>Saxons</HI> did their Villains, for the performance of the Offices which they thought too mean for those who were ennobl'd by Liberty, and the use of Arms, by which the Commonwealth was defended and enlarg'd. Tho the <HI>Romans</HI> scorn'd to give the title of Lord to those who had usurp'd a power over their Lives and Fortunes; yet every one of them was a Lord in relation to his own Servants, and altogether are often call'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romanos rerum Dominos. <BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Lords of the world:</HI> the like is seen almost every where. The Government of <HI>Venice</HI> having continu'd for many ages in the same Familys, has ennobl'd them all. No phrase is more common in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> than <HI>the Lords of Bern,</HI> or <HI>the Lords of Zurich</HI> and other places, tho perhaps there is not a man amongst them who pretends to be a Gentleman, according to the modern sense put upon that word. The States of the United Provinces are call'd High and Mighty Lords, and the same title is given to each of them in particular. Nay, the word <HI>Heer,</HI> which signifys Lord both in high and low <HI>Dutch,</HI> is as common as Monsieur in <HI>France,</HI> Signor in <HI>Italy,</HI> or Sennor in <HI>Spain;</HI> and is given to every one who is not of a sordid con∣dition, but especially to Soldiers: and tho a common Soldier be now a much meaner thing than it was antiently, no man speaking to a company of Soldiers in <HI>Italian,</HI> uses any other stile than <HI>Signori Soldati;</HI> and the like is done in other Languages. 'Tis not therefore to be thought strange, if the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who in their own Country had scorn'd any other employ∣ment than that of the Sword, should think themselves farther ennobl'd,
<PB N="356" REF="364"/>
 when by their Arms they had acquir'd a great and rich Country, and driven out or subdu'd the former inhabitants. They might well distin∣guish themselves from the Villains they brought with them, or the <HI>Britans</HI> they had enslav'd. They might well be call'd <HI>Magnates, Proceres regni, Nobiles, Angliae Nobilitas, Barones;</HI> and the Assemblys of them justly call'd <HI>Concilium Regni Generale, Ʋniversitas totius Angliae Nobilium, Ʋni∣versitas Baronagii,</HI> according to the variety of times and other occurrences. We have such footsteps remaining of the name of Baron, as plainly shew the signification of it. The Barons of <HI>London</HI> and the Cinq Ports are known to be only the Freemen of those places. In the petty Court▪Ba∣rons, every man who may be of a Jury is a Baron. These are Noble∣men; for there are noble Nations as well as noble men in Nations. The <HI>Mammalukes</HI> accounted themselves to be all noble, tho born slaves; and when they had ennobl'd themselves by the use of Arms, they look'd up∣on the noblest of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> as their slaves. <HI>Tertullian</HI> writing, not to some eminent men, but to the whole People of <HI>Carthage,</HI> calls them <HI>An∣tiquitate Nobiles, Nobilitate felices.</HI> Such were the <HI>Saxons,</HI> ennobl'd by a perpetual application to those exercises that belong to Noblemen, and an abhorrence to any thing that is vile and sordid.</P>
<P>Lest this should seem far fetch'd, to those who please themselves with cavilling, they are to know, that the same General Councils are exprest by other Authors in other words. They are call'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commune Concilium Episcoporum, Procerum, Comitum &amp; omnium Sapientum, Seniorum &amp; Populorum totius regni. <BIBL>Bed. Eccl. Hist.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>The General Council of the Bishops, Noblemen, Counts, all the wise men, Elders, and People of the whole Kingdom,</HI> in the time of <HI>Ina.</HI> In that <HI>Edward</HI> the elder, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Magnum Concilium Episcoporum, Abbatum, Fidelium, Procerum &amp; Populorum.</NOTE><HI>The Great Council of the Bishops, Abbots, Noblemen and People.

This Act has bin confirm'd by thirty Parliaments; and the pro∣ceedings with Kings, who have violated their Oaths, as well before as after the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, which have bin already mention'd, are sufficient to shew, that <HI>England</HI> has always bin govern'd by it self, and never acknowledg'd any other Lord than such as they thought fit to set up.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIX. The King was never Master of the Soil.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who without regard to truth, resolve to insist upon such points as they think may serve their designs, when they find it can∣not be deny'd that the powers before mention'd have bin exercis'd by the <HI>English</HI> and other Nations, say, that they were the concessions of Kings, who being masters of the Soil, might bestow parcels upon some Persons with such conditions as they pleas'd, retaining to themselves the supreme dominion of the whole: and having already, as they think, made them the Fountains of Honor, they proceed to make them also the Fountains of Property; and for proof of this alledg, that all Lands, tho held of mean Lords, do by their Tenures at last result upon the King, as the Head from whom they are enjoy'd. This might be of force if it were true: but matters of the highest importance requiring a most evident proof, we are to examin, First, if it be possible; and in the next place, if it be true.</P>
<P>1. For the first; No man can give what he has not. Whoever there∣fore will pretend that the King has bestow'd this propriety, must prove that he had it in himself. I confess, that the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portu∣gal</HI> obtain'd from the Pope grants of the Territorys they possest in the <HI>West-Indys;</HI> and this might be of some strength, if the Pope as Vicar of Christ had an absolute dominion over the whole earth; but if that fail, the whole falls to the ground, and he is ridiculously liberal of that which no way belongs to him. My business is not to dispute that point; but before it can have any influence upon our Affairs, our Kings are to prove, that they are Lords of <HI>England</HI> upon the same Title, or some other equi∣valent to it. When that is done, we shall know upon whom they have a dependence, and may at leisure consider, whether we ought to acknow∣ledg and submit to such a Power, or give reasons for our resusal. But there being no such thing in our present case, their property must be grounded upon something else, or we may justly conclude they have none.</P>
<P>In order to this 'tis hardly worth the pains to search into the obscure remains of the <HI>British</HI> Historys: For when the <HI>Romans</HI> deserted our Island, they did not confer the right they had (whether more or less) up∣on any man, but left the enjoyment of it to the poor remainders of the Nation, and their own establish'd Colonys, who were grown to be one People with the Natives. The <HI>Saxons</HI> came under the conduct of <HI>Hengist</HI> and <HI>Horsa,</HI> who seem to have bin sturdy Pirats; but did not (that I can learn) bear any Characters in their persons of the so much admir'd So∣vereign Majesty, that should give them an absolute dominion or pro∣priety, either in their own Country, or any other they should set their feet upon. They came with about a hundred men; and chusing rather <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. West. Flor. Hist.</NOTE>to serve <HI>Vortigern,</HI> than to depend upon what they could get by rapine at Sea, liv'd upon a small proportion of Land by him allotted to them. Tho this seems to be but a slender encouragement, yet it was enough to invite many others to follow their Example and Fortune; so that their
<PB N="358" REF="366"/>
 number increasing, the County of <HI>Kent</HI> was given to them, under the obligation of serving the <HI>Britans</HI> in their Wars. Not long after, Lands in <HI>Northumberland</HI> were bestow'd upon another company of them with the same condition. This was all the Title they had to what they enjoy'd, till they treacherously kill'd four hundred and sixty, or, as <HI>William</HI> of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE><HI>Malmsbury</HI> says, three hundred principal men of the Nobility, and made <HI>Vortigern</HI> Prisoner, who had bin so much their Benefactor, that he seems never to have deserv'd well but from them, and to have incens'd the <HI>Britans</HI> by the favor he shew'd them, as much as by the worst of his Vices. And certainly actions of this kind, compos'd of falshood and cruelty, can never create a right, in the opinion of any better men than <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Disciples, who think that the power only is to be regarded, and not the means by which it is obtain'd. But tho it should be granted that a right had bin thus acquir'd, it must accrue to the Nation, not to <HI>Hengist</HI> and <HI>Horsa.</HI> If such an acquisition be call'd a Conquest, the benefit must belong to those that conquer'd. This was not the work of two men; and those who had bin free at home, can never be thought to have left their own Country, to fight as slaves for the glory and profit of two men in another. It cannot be said that their wants compel'd them, for their Leaders suffer'd the same, and could not be reliev'd but by their assistance; and whether their enterprize was good or bad, just or unjust, it was the same to all: No one man could have any right peculiar to himself, unless they who gain'd it, did confer it upon him: and 'tis no way probable, that they who in their own Country had kept their Princes within very narrow limits, as has bin prov'd, should resign them∣selves, and all they had, as soon as they came hither. But we have al∣ready shewn that they always continu'd most obstinate defenders of their Liberty, and the Government to which they had bin accustom'd; that they manag'd it by themselves, and acknowledg'd no other Laws than their own. Nay, if they had made such a resignation of their Right, as was necessary to create one in their Leaders, it would be enough to over∣throw the proposition; for 'tis not then the Leader that gives to the Peo∣ple, but the People to the Leader. If the people had not a right to give what they did give, none was confer'd upon the receiver: if they had a right, he that should pretend to derive a benefit from thence, must prove the grant, that the nature and intention of it may appear.</P>
<P>2. To the second: If it be said that Records testify all Grants to have bin originally from the King; I answer, That tho it were con∣fest, (which I absolutely deny, and affirm that our Rights and Li∣bertys are innate, inherent, and enjoy'd time out of mind before we had Kings) it could be nothing to the question, which is concerning Reason and Justice; and if they are wanting, the defect can never be supply'd by any matter of fact, tho never so clearly prov'd. Or if a Right be pretended to be grounded upon a matter of fact, the thing to be prov'd is, that the people did really confer such a right upon the first, or some other Kings: And if no such thing do appear, the proceedings of one or more Kings as if they had it, can be of no value. But in the present case, no such grant is pretended to have bin made, either to the first, or to any of the following Kings; the Right they had not, their Successors could not inherit, and conse∣quently cannot have it, or at most no better title to it than that of Usurpation.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="367"/>
But as they who inquire for truth ought not to deny or conceal any thing, I may grant that Mannors, &amp;c. were enjoy'd by tenure from Kings; but that will no way prejudice the cause I defend, nor signify more than that the Countrys which the <HI>Saxons</HI> had acquir'd, were to be divided among them; and to avoid the quarrels that might arise, if every man took upon him to seize what he could, a certain method of making the distribution was necessarily to be fix'd; and it was fit, that every man should have something in his own hands to justify his Title to what he possest, according to which controversys should be determin'd. This must be testify'd by some body, and no man could be so fit, or of so much credit as he who was chief among them; and this is no more than is usual in all the Societys of the World. The Mayor of every Corpo∣ration, the Speaker or Clerk of the House of Peers or House of Com∣mons, the first President of every Parliament, or Presidial in <HI>France;</HI> the Consul, Burgermaster, Advoyer or Bailiff in every free Town of <HI>Holland, Germany</HI> or <HI>Switzerland,</HI> sign the publick Acts that pass in those places. The Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa</HI> do the like, tho they have no other power than what is confer'd upon them, and of themselves can do little or nothing. The Grants of our Kings are of the same nature, tho the words <HI>mero motu nostro</HI> seem to imply the contrary; for Kings speak always in the plural number, to shew that they do not act for themselves, but for the Societys over which they are plac'd; and all the veneration that is, or can be given to their Acts, dos not exalt them, but those from whom their Authority is deriv'd, and for whom they are to execute. The Tyrants of the East, and other Barbarians, whose power is most absolute, speak in the single number, as appears by the decrees of <HI>Nabu∣chodonosor, Cyrus, Darius</HI> and <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> recited in Scripture, with others that we hear of daily from those parts: but wheresoever there is any thing of civility or regularity in Government, the Prince uses the plural, to shew that he acts in a publick capacity. From hence, says <HI>Grotius,</HI> the rights of Kings to send Embassadors, make Leagues, &amp;c. do arise: the confederacys made by them do not terminate with their lives, because they are not for themselves; they speak not in their own Persons, but as representing their People; and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rex regno exutus, jus legandi amittit. <BIBL>Grot. de Jur. Bell.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>a King who is depriv'd of his Kingdom loses the right of sending Embassadors,</HI> because he can no longer speak for those, who by their own consent, or by a foreign force, are cut off from him. The question is not whether such a one be justly or unjustly de∣priv'd (for that concerns only those who do it or suffer it) but whether he can oblige the People; and 'tis ridiculous for any Nation to treat with a man that cannot perform what shall be agreed, or for him to stipulate that which can oblige, and will be made good only by himself.</P>
<P>But tho much may be left to the discretion of Kings in the distribution of Lands and the like, yet it no way diminishes the right of the People, nor confers any upon them otherwise to dispose of what belongs to the publick, than may tend to the common good, and the accomplishment of those ends for which they are intrusted. Nay, if it were true, that a conquer'd Country did belong to the Crown, the King could not dispose of it, because 'tis annex'd to the Office, add not alienable by the Person. This is not only found in regular mix'd Monarchys (as in <HI>Sweden,</HI> where the Grants made by the last Kings have bin lately rescinded by the General Assembly of Estates, as contrary to Law) but even in the most absolute,
<PB N="360" REF="368"/>
 as in <HI>France,</HI> where the present King, who has stretch'd his power to the utmost, has lately acknowledg'd that he cannot do it; and according to the known maxim of the State, that the demeasnes of the Crown, which are design'd for the defraying of publick Charges, cannot be alienated, all the Grants made within the last fifteen years have bin annul'd; even those who had bought Lands of the Crown have bin call'd to account, and the Sums given being compar'd with the profits receiv'd, and a mo∣derate interest allow'd to the purchasers, so much of the principal as re∣main'd due to them has bin repay'd, and the Lands resum'd.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXX. <HI>Henry</HI> the First was King of <HI>England</HI> by as good a Title as any of his Predecessors or Successors.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING made it appear, as I suppose, that the antient Nobility of <HI>England</HI> was compos'd of such men as had bin ennobl'd by bear∣ing Arms in the defence or enlargement of the Commonwealth; that the Dukes, Earls, &amp;c. were those who commanded them; that they and their dependents receiv'd Lands for such services, under an obligation of continuing to render the like, and according to their several degrees and proportions, to provide and maintain Horses, Arms and Men for the same uses; it cannot be deny'd that they were such Gentlemen and Lords of Mannors, as we now call Commoners, together with the Freehold∣ers, and such as in war were found most able to be their Leaders. Of these the Micklegemots, Wittenagemots, and other publick Assemblys did consist; and nothing can be more absurd than to assign the names and rights of Duke, Earl and Vicount, which were names of Offices, to those who have not the Offices, and are no way fit for them. If our Author therefore had said, that such as these, who had always com∣pos'd the great Councils of our Nation, had in favour of <HI>Henry</HI> the First, bestow'd the Crown upon him, as they had done upon his Father and Brother, I should agree with him: but 'tis the utmost extravagance to say, that he who had neither title nor possession, should give the power to those who had always bin in the possession of it, and exercis'd it in giving to him whatsoever he had. But I most wonder he should so far forget himself, to call this <HI>Henry</HI> a Usurper, and detract from the validity of his Acts, because he had no title; whereas there neither is, was, or can be a Usurper if there be any truth in his Doctrin: for he plainly tells us, we are only to look to the power, and not at all to the means and ways by which it is obtain'd; and making no difference between a King and a Tyrant, enjoins an equal submission to the commands of both. If this were only a slip of his Pen, and he did really take this <HI>Henry</HI> to be a Usurper, because he had not a good title, I should desire to know the marks by which a lawful King is distinguish'd from an Usurper, and in what a just Title dos consist. If he place it in an hereditary Succession, we ought to be inform'd, whether this right must be deduc'd from one universal Lord of Mankind, or from a particular Lord of every People: If from the universal Lord, the same descent that gives him a right to the dominion of any one Country, enslaves the whole world to him;
<PB N="361" REF="369"/>
if from the particular Lord of one place, proof must be given how he came to be so: for if there was a defect in the first, it can never be re∣pair'd, and the possession is no more than a continu'd Usurpation. But having already prov'd the absurdity of any pretence to either, I shall for∣bear the repetition, and only say, that if the course of Succession may never be justly interrupted, the Family of <HI>Meroveus</HI> could not have had any right to the Crown of <HI>France; Pepin</HI> was a Usurper, if it must for ever have continu'd in the descendents of <HI>Meroveus,</HI> and <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> could have no title, if the Race of <HI>Pepin</HI> might not be dispossest. I leave our Author to dispute this point with the King of <HI>France;</HI> and when he has so far convinc'd him thathe is a Usurper, as to persuade him to resign his Crown to the House of <HI>Austria</HI> claiming from <HI>Pharamond,</HI> or to that of <HI>Lorrain</HI> as descended from <HI>Pepin,</HI> I can give him half a dozen more knots which will not be with less difficulty unty'd, and which instead of establishing the Titles of such Kings as are known to us, will overthrow them all, unless a Right be given to Usurpation, or the consent of a People do confer it.</P>
<P>But if there be such a thing as a Usurper, and a Rule by which men may judg of Usurpation, 'tis not only lawful but necessary to examin the Titles of such as go under the name of Kings, that we may know whether they are truly so or not, lest thro ignorance we chance to give the Veneration and Obedience that is due to a King, to one who is not a King, and deny it to him, who by an uninterruptible Line of Descent is our natural Lord; and thereby prefer the worst of men and our most bitter enemy before the Person we ought to look upon as our Father: and if this prove dangerous to one or more Kings, 'tis our Author's fault, not mine.</P>
<P>If there be no Usurper, nor Rule of distinguishing him from a lawful Prince, <HI>Filmer</HI> is the worst of all triflers and impostors, who grounds his Arguments in the most serious matters upon what he esteems to be false; but the truth is, he seems to have set himself against humanity and com∣mon sense, as much as against Law and Vertue: and if he who so fre∣quently contradicts himself, can be said to mean any thing, he would au∣thorize rapine and murder, and persuade us to account those to be right∣ful Kings, who by treachery and other unjust means overthrow the right of Descent which he pretends to esteem sacred, as well as the Li∣bertys of Nations, which by better Judges are thought to be so; and gives the odious name of Usurpation to the Advancement of one who is made King by the consent of a willing People.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Henry</HI> the First were a Usurper, I desire to know whether the same name belongs to all our Kings, or which of them deserves a better; that we may understand whose acts ought to be reputed legal, and to whose Descent we owe veneration, or whether we are wholly exempted from all: for I cannot see a possibility of fixing the guilt of Usurpation upon <HI>Henry</HI> the First, without involving many, if not all our Kings in the same.</P>
<P>If his Title was not good because his Brother <HI>Robert</HI> was still living, that of <HI>Rufus</HI> is by the same reason overthrown; and <HI>William</HI> their Fa∣ther being a bastard could have none. This fundamental defect could never be repair'd: sor the Successors could inherit no more than the right of the first, which was nothing. <HI>Stephen</HI> could deduce no Title either from <HI>Norman</HI> or <HI>Saxon;</HI> whatsoever <HI>Henry</HI> the Second pretended, must be from his Mother <HI>Maud,</HI> and any other might have bin preser'd before her as well as he. If her Title was from the <HI>Normans,</HI> it must be void,
<PB N="362" REF="370"/>
 since they had none, and the story of <HI>Edgar Atheling</HI> is too impertinent to deserve mention. But however, it could be of no advantage to her; for <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Brother to her Mother from whom only her Title could be deriv'd, was then alive with his Son <HI>Henry,</HI> who dying not long after, left three Sons and three Daughters, whose posterity be∣ing distributed into many Familys of <HI>Scotland,</HI> remains to this day; and if proximity of blood is to be consider'd, ought always to have bin pre∣fer'd before her and her Descendents, unless there be a Law that gives the preference to Daughters before Sons. What right soever <HI>Henry</HI> the Second had, it must necessarily have perish'd with him, all his Children having bin begotten in manifest Adultery on <HI>Eleanor</HI> of <HI>Gascony,</HI> during the life of <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> her first Husband: and nothing could be alledg'd to color the business, but a Dispensation from the Pope directly against the Law of God, and the words of our Saviour, who says, <HI>That a Wife cannot be put away unless for Adultery, and he that marrys her that is put away commits Adultery.</HI> The pollution of this spring is not to be cur'd; but tho it should pass unregarded, no one part of the Succession since that time has remain'd intire. <HI>John</HI> was prefer'd before <HI>Arthur</HI> his elder Bro∣ther's Son: <HI>Edward</HI> the Third was made King by the deposition of his Father: <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth by that of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second. If the House of <HI>Mortimer</HI> or <HI>York</HI> had the right, <HI>Henry</HI> the 4<HI>th,</HI> 5<HI>th,</HI> and 6<HI>th</HI> were not Kings, and all who claim under them have no Title. However, <HI>Richard</HI> the Third could have none; for the Children of his elder Brother the Duke of <HI>Clarence</HI> were then living. The Children of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth may be suspected of Bastardy; and tho it may have bin otherwise, yet that matter is not so clear as things of such importance ought to be, and the consequence may reach very far. But tho that scruple were remov'd, 'tis certain that <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh was not King in the right of his Wife <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> for he reign'd before and after her; and for his other Titles, we <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mem. de Commin.</NOTE>may believe <HI>Philip de Commines,</HI> who says, <HI>He had neither cross nor pile.</HI> If <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth had a right in himself, or from his Mother, he should have reign'd immediately after her death, which he never pre∣tended, nor to succeed till his Father was dead, thereby acknowledging he had no right but from him, unless the Parliament and People can give it. The like may be said of his Children. <HI>Mary</HI> could have no Title if she was a Bastard, begotten in Incest; but if her Mother's Marriage was good and she legitimate, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> could have none.</P>
<P>Yet all these were lawful Kings and Queens; their Acts continue in force to this day to all intents and purposes: the Parliament and People made them to be so, when they had no other Title. The Parliament and People therefore have the power of making Kings: Those who are so made are not Usurpers: We have had none but such for more than seven hundred years. They were therefore lawful Kings, or this Na∣tion has had none in all that time; and if our Author like this conclusion, the account from whence it is drawn may without difficulty be carry'd as high as our <HI>English</HI> Historys do reach.</P>
<P>This being built upon the steddy Foundation of Law, History and Reason, is not to be remov'd by any Man's opinion; especially by one ac∣company'd with such circumstances as Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> was in during the last years of his life: And there is something of baseness, as well as prevarication, in turning the words of an eminent Person, reduc'd to great difficultys, to a sense no way agreeing with his former Actions or Writ∣ings, and no less tending to impair his Reputation than to deceive others.
<PB N="363" REF="371"/>
Our Author is highly guilty of both, in citing Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> to inva∣lidate the Great Charter of our Libertys, as <HI>begun by Ʋsurpation, and shew'd to the world by Rebellion;</HI> whereas no such thing, nor any thing like it in word or principle, can be found in the Works that deserve to go under his Name. The Dialogue in question, with some other small Pieces pub∣lish'd after his death, deserve to be esteem'd spurious: Or if, from a desire of Life, when he knew his Head lay under the Ax, he was brought to say things no way agreeing with what he had formerly profest, they ought rather to be bury'd in oblivion, than produc'd to blemish his Me∣mory. But that the publick Cause may not suffer by his fault, 'tis con∣venient the World should be inform'd, that tho he was a well-qualify'd Gentleman, yet his Morals were no way exact, as appears by his dealings with the brave Earl of <HI>Essex.</HI> And he was so well assisted in his <HI>History of the World,</HI> that an ordinary man with the same helps might have per∣form'd the same things. Neither ought it to be accounted strange, if that which he writ by himself had the tincture of another Spirit, when he was depriv'd of that assistance, tho his Life had not depended upon the will of the Prince; and he had never said, That <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>W.

<HEAD>SECT. XXXI. Free Nations have a right of meeting, when and where they please, unless they deprive themselves of it.</HEAD>
<P>A Perverted Judgment always leads men into a wrong way, and per∣suades them to believe that those things favor their cause, that ut∣terly overthrow it. For a proof of this, I desire our Author's words may be consider'd. <HI>In the former Parliaments,</HI> says he, <HI>instituted and continu'd since</HI> Henry <HI>the First his time, is not to be found the usage of any natural Li∣berty of the People: For all those Libertys that are claim'd in Parliament, are Libertys of Grace from the King, and not the Libertys of Nature to the People: For if the Liberty were natural, it would give power to the multitude to as∣semble themselves, when and where they pleas'd, to bestow the Sovereignty, and by pactions to limit and direct the exercise of it.</HI> And I say that Nations be∣ing naturally free, may meet, when and where they please; may dis∣pose of the Sovereignty, and may direct or limit the exercise of it, unless by their own Act they have depriv'd themselves of that Right: and there could never have bin a lawful Assembly of any People in the World, if they had not had that Power in themselves. It was prov'd in the prece∣ding Section, that all our Kings having no Title, were no more than what the Nobility and People made them to be; that they could have no Power but what was given to them, and could confer none except what they had receiv'd. If they can therefore call Parliaments, the power of calling them must have bin given to them, and could not be given by any who had it not in themselves. The <HI>Israelites</HI> met together, and chose <HI>Ehud, Gideon, Sampson, Jephtha,</HI> and others, to be their Leaders, whom they judg'd fit
<PB N="364" REF="372"/>
 to deliver them from their Enemys. By the same right they assembl'd at <HI>Mispeth</HI> to make War against the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> when Justice was deny'd to be done against those who had villanously abus'd the Levite's Concubine. In the like manner they would have made <HI>Gideon</HI> King, but he refus'd. In the same place they met, and chose <HI>Saul</HI> to be their King. He being dead, the men of <HI>Judah</HI> assembl'd themselves, and anointed <HI>Da∣vid:</HI> not long after, all the Tribes met at <HI>Hebron,</HI> made a Contract with him, and receiv'd him as their King. In the same manner, tho by worse Counsel, they made <HI>Absalom</HI> King. And the like was attempted in favor of <HI>Sheba</HI> the Son of <HI>Bichri,</HI> tho they then had a King chosen by themselves. When they found themselves opprest by the Tributes that had bin laid upon them by <HI>Solomon,</HI> they met at <HI>Shechem;</HI> and being displeas'd with <HI>Rehoboam</HI>'s answer to their complaints, ten of the Tribes made <HI>Jeroboam</HI> King. <HI>Jehu,</HI> and all the other Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> whether good or bad, had no other Title than was confer'd upon them by the prevailing part of the People; which could not have given them any, unless they had met to∣gether; nor meet together without the consent, and against the will of those that reign'd, unless the Power had bin in themselves.</P>
<P>Where Governments are more exactly regulated, the Power of judging when 'tis fit to call the Senat or People together, is refer'd to one or more Magistrats; as in <HI>Rome</HI> to the Consuls or Tribuns, in <HI>Athens</HI> to the Archons, and in <HI>Thebes</HI> to the Beotarches: but none of them could have these Pow∣ers, unless they had bin given by those who advanc'd them to the Ma∣gistracys to which they were annex'd; nor could they have bin so an∣nex'd, if those who created them had not had the right in themselves. If they Officers neglected their duty of calling such Assemblys when the publick Affairs requir'd, the People met by their own Authority, and pu∣nish'd the Person, or abrogated the Magistracy, as appears in the case of the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> and many others that might be alledg'd, if the thing were not so plain as to need no further proof. The reason of this is, that they who institute a Magistracy, best know whether the end of the Institution be rightly pursu'd or not: And all just Magistracys being the same in es∣sence, tho differing in form, the same right must perpetually belong to those who put the Sovereign Power into the hands of one, a few, or many men, which is what our Author calls the Disposal of the Sovereign∣ty. Thus the <HI>Romans</HI> did when they created Kings, Consuls, Military Tribuns, Dictators, or <HI>Decemviri:</HI> and it had bin most ridiculous to say, that those Officers gave authority to the People to meet and chuse them; for they who are chosen are the Creatures of those who chuse, and are nothing more than others till they are chosen. The last King of <HI>Sweden, Charles Gustavus,</HI> told a Gentleman who was Embassador there, That the <HI>Swedes</HI> having made him King, when he was poor and had nothing in the World, he had but one work to do, which was so to reign, that they might never repent the good opinion they had conceiv'd of him. They might therefore meet, and did meet to conser the Sovereignty upon him, or he could never have had it: For tho the Kingdom be hereditary to Males or Females, and his Mother was Sister to the Great <HI>Gustavus;</HI> yet having marry'd a stranger without the consent of the Estates, she per∣form'd not the Condition upon which Women are admitted to the Succes∣sion; and thereby falling from her Right, he pretended not to any. The Act of his Election declares he had none, and gives the Crown to him and the Heirs of his Body, with this farther Declaration, that the benefit of his Election should no way extend to his Brother Prince <HI>Adolphus;</HI> and
<PB N="365" REF="373"/>
'tis confest by all the <HI>Swedish</HI> Nation, that if the King now reigning should die without Children, the Estates would proceed to a new Election.</P>
<P>'Tis rightly observ'd by our Author, that if the People might meet and give the Sovereign Power, they might also direct and limit it; for they did meet in this and other Countrys, they did confer the Sovereign Pow∣er, they did limit and direct the exercise; and the Laws of each People shew in what manner and measure it is every where done. This is as cer∣tain in relation to Kings, as any other Magistrats. The Commission of the <HI>Roman</HI> Dictators was, to take care <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ne quid detrimenti Respublica accipiat. <BIBL>T. Liv.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>that the Commonwealth might re∣ceive no detriment.</HI> The same was sometimes given to the Consuls: King <HI>Offa</HI>'s Confession, that he was made King <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In vestrae Libertatis tuitionem. <BIBL>Mat. Par.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>to preserve the publick Liberty,</HI> expresses the same thing: And <HI>Charles Gustavus,</HI> who said he had no other work, than to govern in such a manner, that they who had made him King might not repent, shew'd there was a Rule which he stood oblig'd to follow, and an end which he was to procure, that he might merit and preserve their good opinion. This power of conferring the Sovereignty was exercis'd in <HI>France</HI> by those who made <HI>Meroveus</HI> King, in the prejudice of the two Grandchildren of <HI>Pharamond,</HI> Sons to <HI>Clodion;</HI> by those who excluded his Race, and gave the Crown to <HI>Pepin;</HI> by those who depos'd <HI>Lewis le Debonair,</HI> and <HI>Charles le Gross;</HI> by those who brought in five Kings, that were either Bastards or Strangers, between him and <HI>Charles le Simple;</HI> by those who rejected his Race, and advanc'd <HI>Hugh Capet;</HI> by those who made <HI>Henry</HI> the First King, to the prejudice of <HI>Robert</HI> his elder Brother, and continu'd the Crown in the Race of <HI>Henry</HI> for ten Generations, whilst the Descendents of <HI>Robert</HI> were only Dukes of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> The like was done in <HI>Castille</HI> and <HI>Arragon,</HI> by frequently preferring the younger before the elder Brother; the Descendents of Fe∣males before those of the Male-line in the same degree; the more remote in Blood before the nearest; and sometimes Bastards before the legitimate Issue. The same was done in <HI>England</HI> in relation to every King, since the coming in of the <HI>Normans,</HI> as I shew'd in the last Section, and other pla∣ces of this Work.</P>
<P>That they who gave the Sovereignty, might also circumscribe and di∣rect it, is manifest by the several ways of providing for the Succession in∣stituted by several Nations. Some are merely elective, as the Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> to this day; the Kingdom of <HI>Den∣mark</HI> till the year 1660; that of <HI>Sweden</HI> till the time of <HI>Gustavus Ericson,</HI> who deliver'd that Nation from the oppression of <HI>Christern</HI> II. the cruel King of the <HI>Danes.</HI> In others the Election was confin'd to one or more Fa∣milys, as the Kingdom of the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> to the <HI>Balthei</HI> and <HI>Amalthei.</HI> In some, the eldest Man of the reigning Family was prefer'd before the nearest, as in <HI>Scotland</HI> before the time of <HI>Kennethus.</HI> In other places the nearest in Blood is prefer'd before the elder if more remote. In some, no regard is had to Females, or their Descendents, as in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turky:</HI> in others, they or their Descendents are admitted, either simply as well as Males; or under a condition of marrying in the Country, or with the consent of the Estates, as in <HI>Sweden.</HI> And no other reason can be given for this almost infinite variety of Constitutions, than that they who made
<PB N="366" REF="374"/>
 them would have it so; which could not be, if God and Nature had ap∣pointed one General Rule for all Nations. For in that case, the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> must be elective, as well as that of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Empire; or the Empire and <HI>Poland</HI> hereditary, as that of <HI>France:</HI> Daughters must succeed in <HI>France,</HI> as well as in <HI>England,</HI> or be excluded in <HI>England</HI> as in <HI>France;</HI> and he that would establish one as the Ordinance of God and Na∣ture, must of necessity overthrow all the rest.</P>
<P>A farther exercise of the natural Liberty of Nations is discover'd in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">De jur. bel. &amp; pac.</NOTE>several Limitations put upon the Sovereign Power. Some Kings, says <HI>Grotius,</HI> have the <HI>Summum Imperium summo modo;</HI> others, <HI>modo non sum∣mo:</HI> and amongst those that are under Limitations, the degrees as to more or less, are almost infinite, as I have prov'd already by the example of <HI>Ar∣ragon,</HI> antient <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, the <HI>Normans,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Ca∣stille,</HI> the present Empire, with divers others. And I may safely say, that the antient Government of <HI>France</HI> was much of the same nature to the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the 7<HI>th,</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th:</HI> but the work of emancipating themselves, as they call it, begun by them, is now brought to perfection in a boundless elevation of the King's Greatness and Riches, to the un∣speakable misery of the People.</P>
<P>'Twere a folly to think this Variety proceeds from the Concessions of Kings, who naturally delight in Power, and hate that which crosses their Will. It might with more reason be imagin'd, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Consuls, who were brought up in liberty, who had contracted a love to their Country, and were contented to live upon an equal foot with their fellow Citizens, should confine the Power of their Magistracy to a year; or that the Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> should be graciously pleas'd to give power to the <HI>Coun∣cil of Ten</HI> to punish them capitally if they transgrest the Laws, than that Kings should put such Fetters upon their Power, which they so much ab∣hor; or that they would suffer them, if they could be easily broken. If any one of them should prove so moderate, like <HI>Trajan,</HI> to command the Pre∣fect of the Pretorian Guard to use the Sword for him if he govern'd well, and against him if he did not, it would soon be rescinded by his Successor; the Law which has no other strength than the act of one man, may be an∣nul'd by another. So that nothing dos more certainly prove, that the Laws made in several Countrys to restrain the Power of Kings, and va∣riously to dispose of the Succession, are not from them, than the frequent examples of their fury, who have expos'd themselves to the greatest dan∣gers, and brought infinite miserys upon the People, thro the desire of break∣ing them. It must therefore be concluded, that Nations have power of meeting together, and of conferring, limiting, and directing the Sovereignty; or all must be grounded upon most manifest Injustice and Usurpation.</P>
<P>No man can have a power over a Nation otherwise than <HI>de jure,</HI> or <HI>de facto.</HI> He who pretends to have a power <HI>de jure,</HI> must prove that it is originally inherent in him or his predecessor from whom he inherits; or that it was justly acquir'd by him. The vanity of any pretence to an ori∣ginal Right appears sufficiently, I hope, from the proofs already given, that the first Fathers of Mankind had it not; or if they had, no man could now inherit the same, there being no man able to make good the Genea∣logy that should give him a right to the Succession. Besides, the facility we have of proving the beginnings of all the Familys that reign among us, makes it as absurd for any of them to pretend a perpetual right to Domi∣nion, as for any Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> whose Parents and Birth we know, to say he is the very man <HI>Noah,</HI> who liv'd in the time of the Flood, and is now four or five thousand years old.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="375"/>
If the power were confer'd on him or his Predecessors, 'tis what we ask; for the Collation can be of no value, unless made by those who had a right to do it; and the original Right by Descent failing, no one can have any over a Free People but themselves, or those to whom they have given it.</P>
<P>If Acquisition be pretended, 'tis the same thing; for there can be no right to that which is acquir'd, unless the right of invading be prov'd; and that being done, nothing can be acquir'd except what belong'd to the Person that was invaded, and that only by him who had the right of in∣vading. No man ever did or could conquer a Nation by his own strength; no man therefore could ever acquire a personal right over any; and if it was confer'd upon him by those who made the Conquest with him, they were the People that did it. He can no more be said to have the Right ori∣ginally in and from himself, than a Magistrate of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens</HI> imme∣diately after his Creation; and having no other at the beginning, he can have none to eternity; for the Nature of it must refer to the Original, and cannot be chang'd by time.</P>
<P>Whatsoever therefore proceeds not from the consent of the People, must be <HI>de facto</HI> only, that is void of all right; and 'tis impossible there should not be a right of destroying that which is grounded upon none; and by the same rule that one man enjoys what he gain'd by violence, another may take it from him. <HI>Cyrus</HI> overthrew the <HI>Assyrians</HI> and <HI>Babylonians, Alexander</HI> the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians;</HI> and if they had no right of making war upon those Nations, the Nations could not but have a right of recovering all that had bin unjustly taken from them, and avenging the evils they had suffer'd. If the cause of the war was originally just, and not corrupted by an intemperate use of the victory, the conquer'd People was per∣haps oblig'd to be quiet; but the conquering Armys that confer'd upon their Generals what they had taken from their Enemys, might as justly expect an account of what they had given, and that it should be imploy'd according to the intention of the givers, as the People of any City might do from their regularly created Magistrats; because it was as impossible for <HI>Cyrus, Alexander</HI> or <HI>Cesar,</HI> to gain a power over the Armys they led, without their consent, as for <HI>Pericles, Valerius,</HI> or any other disarm'd Ci∣tizen to gain more power in their respective Citys, than was voluntarily confer'd upon them. And I know no other difference between Kingdoms so constituted by conquering Armys, and such as are establish'd in the most orderly manner, than that the first usually incline more to War, the latter to Justice and Peace. But there have not bin wanting many of the first sort (especially the Nations coming from the North) who were no less exact in ordaining that which tended to the preservation of Liberty, nor less severe in seeing it punctually perform'd, than the most regular Com∣monwealths that ever were in the World. And it can with no more rea∣son be pretended, that the <HI>Goths</HI> receiv'd their Privileges from <HI>Alan</HI> or <HI>Theodoric,</HI> the <HI>Francs</HI> from <HI>Pharamond</HI> or <HI>Meroveus,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> from <HI>Ina</HI> or <HI>Ethelred,</HI> than that the Liberty of <HI>Athens</HI> was the gift of <HI>Themisto∣cles</HI> or <HI>Pericles,</HI> that the Empire of <HI>Rome</HI> proceeded from the liberality of <HI>Brutus</HI> or <HI>Valerius,</HI> and that the Commonwealth of <HI>Venice</HI> at this day sub∣sists by the favor of the <HI>Contarini</HI> or <HI>Moresini:</HI> which must reduce us to matter of Right, since that of Fact void of Right can signify nothing.</P>

<HEAD> SECT. XXXII. The Powers of Kings are so various according to the Constitutions of several States, that no Consequence can be drawn to the prejudice or advantage of any one, merely from the Name.</HEAD>
<P>IN opposition to what is above said, some alledg the name of <HI>King,</HI> as if there were a charm in the word; and our Author seems to put more weight upon it, than in the Reasons he brings to support his Cause. But that we may see there is no efficacy in it, and that it conveys no other right than what particular Nations may annex to it, we are to consider,</P>
<P>1. That the most absolute Princes that are or have bin in the World, never had the name of King: whereas it has bin frequently given to those whose powers have bin very much restrain'd. The <HI>Cesars</HI> were never call'd Kings, till the sixth Age of Christianity: the Califs and Soldan of <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> the Cham of <HI>Tartary,</HI> or the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> never took that name, nor any other of the same signification. The <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Moscovy</HI> has it not, tho he is as absolute a Monarch, and his People as miserable slaves as any in the World. On the other side, the chief Ma∣gistrats of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> for some time, those of <HI>Sparta, Arragon, Sweden, Denmark</HI> and <HI>England, who could do nothing but by Law,</HI> have bin call'd Kings. This may be enough to shew, that a Name being no way essen∣tial, what Title soever is given to the Chief Magistrate, he can have no other power than the Laws and Customs of his Country do give, or the People confer upon him.</P>
<P>2. The names of Magistrats are often chang'd, tho the power continue to be the same; and the powers are sometimes alter'd tho the name re∣main. When <HI>Octavius Cesar</HI> by the force of a mad corrupted Soldiery had overthrown all Law and Right, he took no other Title in relation to Mi∣litary Affairs than that of <HI>Imperator,</HI> which in the time of Liberty was by the Armys often given to Pretors and Consuls: In Civil matters he was, as he pretended, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unitia potestate contentus. <BIBL>C. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>it.</BIBL></NOTE>content with the power of Tribun; and the like was observ'd in his Successor, who to new invented Usurpations, <HI>gave old and approv'd names.</HI> On the other side, those Titles which have bin render'd odious and execrable by the violent exercise of an absolute Power, are sometimes made popular by moderate limitations; as in <HI>Germany,</HI> where, tho the Monarchy seem to be as well temper'd as any, the Princes retain the same names of <HI>Imperator, Cesar</HI> and <HI>Augustus,</HI> as those had done, who by the excess of their rage and fury had desolated and corrupted the best part of the World.</P>
<P>Sometimes the name is chang'd, tho the power in all respects continue <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vedra. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>na. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>the same. The Lords of <HI>Castille</HI> had for many Ages no other Title than that of Count; and when the Nobility and People thought good, they chang'd it to that of King, without any addition to the power.</P>
<P>The Sovereign Magistrat in <HI>Poland</HI> was call'd Duke till within the last two hundred years, when they gave the title of King to one of the <HI>Jagellan</HI> Family; which title has continu'd to this day, tho without any change in the nature of the Magistracy. And I presume, no wise man will think, that if the <HI>Venetians</HI> should give the name of King to their Duke, it could
<PB N="369" REF="377"/>
confer any other power upon him than he has already, unless more should be confer'd by the Authority of the <HI>Great Council.</HI></P>
<P>3. The same names which in some places denote the Supreme Magi∣stracy, in others are subordinate or merely titular. In <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Dukes and Earls are Subjects: in <HI>Germany</HI> the Electors and some Princes who are call'd by those names, are little less than Sovereigns; and the Dukes of <HI>Savoy, Tuscany, Moscovy</HI> and others, acknowledg no Superior, as well as those of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Castille</HI> had none, when they went under those titles. The same may be said of Kings. Some are subject to a foreign power, as divers of them were subject to the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Babylonian</HI> Mo∣narchs, who for that reason were call'd the Kings of Kings. Some also are tributarys; and when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> first landed in <HI>America,</HI> the great Kings of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> had many others under them. Threescore and ten Kings gather'd up meat under the Table of <HI>Adonibezek.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> had many Kings depending upon them. <HI>Herod</HI> and those of his Race were of this number; and the dispute between him and his Sons <HI>Aristobulus</HI> and <HI>A∣lexander,</HI> was to be determin'd by them; neither durst he decide the matter till it was refer'd to him. But a right of Appeal did still remain, as appears by the case of St. <HI>Paul</HI> when <HI>Agrippa</HI> was King. The Kings of <HI>Mauritania</HI> from the time of <HI>Massinissa,</HI> were under the like dependence: <HI>Jugurtha</HI> went to <HI>Rome</HI> to justify himself for the death of <HI>Micipsa: Juba</HI> was command∣ed by the <HI>Roman</HI> Magistrats, <HI>Scipio, Petreius</HI> and <HI>Afranius;</HI> another <HI>Juba</HI> was made King of the same Country by <HI>Augustus,</HI> and <HI>Tiridates</HI> of <HI>Armenia</HI> by <HI>Nero;</HI> and infinite examples of this nature may be alledg'd. Moreover, their powers are variously regulated, according to the variety of tempers in Nations and Ages. Some have restrain'd the powers that by experience were found to be exorbitant; others have dissolv'd the bonds that were laid upon them: and Laws relating to the Institution, Abrogation, Enlarge∣ment or Restriction of the Regal Power, would be utterly insignificant if this could not be done. But such Laws are of no effect in any other Coun∣try than where they are made. The lives of the <HI>Spartans</HI> did not depend upon the will of <HI>Agesilaus</HI> or <HI>Leonidas,</HI> because <HI>Nabuchodonosor</HI> could kill or save whom he pleas'd: and tho the King of <HI>Marocco</HI> may stab his Sub∣jects, throw them to the Lions, or hang them upon tenterhooks; yet a King of <HI>Poland</HI> would probably be call'd to a severe account, if he should unjustly kill a single man.</P>

<DIV3 N="33" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXXIII. The Liberty of a People is the Gift of God and Nature.</HEAD>
<P>IF any man ask how Nations come to have the power of doing these things, I answer, That Liberty being only an exemption from the dominion of another, the question ought not to be, how a Nation can come to be free, but how a man comes to have a dominion over it; for till the right of Dominion be prov'd and justify'd, Liberty subsists as arising from the Nature and Being of a man. <HI>Tertullian</HI> speaking of the Emperors says, <HI>Ab eo Imperium à quo spiritus;</HI> and we taking man in his first condition may justly say, <HI>ab eo Libertas à quo spiritus;</HI> for no man can owe more than he has receiv'd. The Creature having nothing, and being nothing but what the Creator makes him, must owe all to him, and nothing to any one from whom he has receiv'd nothing. Man there∣fore
<PB N="370" REF="378"/>
 must be naturally free, unless he be created by another power than we have yet heard of. The obedience due to Parents arises from hence, in that they are the instruments of our Generation; and we are instructed by the light of Reason, that we ought to make great returns to those from whom under God we have receiv'd all. When they die we are their Heirs, we enjoy the same rights, and devolve the same to our Posterity. God only, who con∣fers this right upon us, can deprive us of it: and we can no way understand he dos so, unless he had so declar'd by express Revelation, or had set some distinguishing marks of Dominion and Subjection upon men; and, as an ingenious Person not long since said, caus'd some to be born with Crowns on their heads, and all others with Saddles upon their backs. This Liberty therefore must continue, till it be either forfeited or willingly resign'd. The forfeiture is hardly comprehensible in a multitude that is not enter'd into any Society; for as they are all equal, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Par in parem non habet imperium.</NOTE><HI>equals can have no right over each other,</HI> no man can forfeit any thing to one who can justly demand nothing, unless it may be by a personal injury, which is nothing to this case; be∣cause where there is no Society, one man is not bound by the actions of an∣other. All cannot join in the same Act, because they are join'd in none; or if they should, no man could recover, much less transmit the forfeiture; and not being transmitted, it perishes as if it had never bin, and no man can claim any thing from it.</P>
<P>'Twill be no less difficult to bring resignation to be subservient to our Author's purpose; for men could not resign their Liberty, unless they naturally had it in themselves. Resignation is a publick declaration of their assent to be govern'd by the Person to whom they resign; that is, they do by that Act constitute him to be their Governor. This necessa∣rily puts us upon the inquiry, Why they do resign, how they will be go∣vern'd, and proves the Governor to be their creature; and the right of dis∣posing the Government must be in them, or they who receive it can have none. This is so evident to common sense, that it were impertinent to ask who made <HI>Carthage, Athens, Rome</HI> or <HI>Venice</HI> to be free Citys. Their Charters were not from men, but from God and Nature. When a number of <HI>Phenicians</HI> had found a Port on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> they might perhaps agree with the Inhabitants for a parcel of Ground, but they brought their Liberty with them. When a company of <HI>Latins, Sabins</HI> and <HI>Tuscans</HI> met together upon the Banks of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> and chose rather to build a City for themselves, than to live in such as were adjacent, they carry'd their Liberty in their own Breasts, and had Hands and Swords to defend it. This was their Charter; and <HI>Romulus</HI> could confer no more upon them, than <HI>Dido</HI> upon the <HI>Carthaginians.</HI> When a multitude of barbarous Na∣tions infested <HI>Italy,</HI> and no protection could be expected from the corrup∣ted and perishing Empire, such as agreed to seek a place of refuge in the scatter'd Islands of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Gulf, had no need of any man's Au∣thority to ratify the Institution of their Government. They who were the formal part of the City, and had built the material, could not but have a right of governing as they pleas'd, since if they did amiss, the hurt was only to themselves. 'Tis probable enough that some of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, as Lords of the Soil, might have pretended to a Do∣minion over them, if there had bin any color for it: but nothing of that kind appearing in thirteen hundred years, we are not like to hear of any
<PB N="371" REF="379"/>
such cavils. 'Tis agreed by Mankind, that subjection and protection are relative; and that he who cannot protect those that are under him, in vain pretends to a Dominion over them. The only ends for which Go∣vernments are constituted, and obedience render'd to them, are the ob∣taining of Justice and Protection; and they who cannot provide for both, give the People a right of taking such ways as best please themselves, in or∣der to their own safety.</P>
<P>The matter is yet more clear in relation to those who never were in any Society, as at the beginning, or renovation of the World after the Flood; or who upon the dissolution of the Societys to which they did once belong, or by some other accident, have bin oblig'd to seek new habita∣tions. Such were those who went from <HI>Babylon</HI> upon the confusion of Tongues, those who escap'd from <HI>Troy</HI> when it was burnt by the <HI>Greci∣ans;</HI> almost all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> with many of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> up∣on the dissolution of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. To which may be added a mul∣titude of Northern Nations, who, when they had increas'd to such num∣bers that their Countrys could no longer nourish them, or because they wanted skill to improve their Lands, were sent out to provide for them∣selves, and having done so, did erect many Kingdoms and States, either by themselves, or in union and coalition with the antient Inhabitants.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to say, that wheresoever they came, the Land did belong to some body, and that they who came to dwell there must be subject to the Laws of those who were Lords of the Soil, for that is not always true in fact. Some come into desert Countrys that have no Lord, others into such as are thinly peopled, by men who knowing not how to improve their Land, do either grant part of it upon easy terms to the new comers, or grow into a union with them in the enjoyment of the whole; and Historys furnish us with infinite examples of this nature.</P>
<P>If we will look into our own original, without troubling our selves with the sensless storys of <HI>Samothes</HI> the Son of <HI>Japhet,</HI> and his Magicians, or the Giants begotten by Spirits upon the thirty Daughters of <HI>Danaus,</HI> sent from <HI>Phenicia</HI> in a Boat without Sails, Oars or Rudder, we shall find that when the <HI>Romans</HI> abandon'd this Island, the Inhabitants were left to a full li∣berty of providing for themselves: and whether we deduce our Original from them or the <HI>Saxons,</HI> or from both, our Ancestors were perfectly free; and the <HI>Normans</HI> having inherited the same Right when they came to be one Nation with the former, we cannot but continue so still, unless we have enslav'd our selves.</P>
<P>Nothing is more contrary to reason than to imagin this. When the fierce barbarity of the <HI>Saxons</HI> came to be softned by a more gentle Climat, the Arts and Religion they learnt, taught them to reform their Manners, and better enabled them to frame Laws for the preservation of their Li∣berty, but no way dimish'd their love to it: and tho the <HI>Normans</HI> might desire to get the Laads of those who had join'd with <HI>Harold,</HI> and of others into their hands; yet when they were settled in the Country, and by mar∣riages united to the antient Inhabitants, they became true Englishmen, and no less lovers of Liberty, and resolute defenders of it, than the <HI>Saxons</HI> had bin. There was then neither conquering <HI>Norman</HI> nor conquer'd <HI>Saxon,</HI> but a great and brave People compos'd of both, united in blood and in∣terest in the defence of their common Rights, which they so well main∣tain'd, that no Prince since that time has too violently encroach'd upon them, who, as the reward of his folly, has not liv'd miserably, and dy'd shamefully.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="380"/>
 Such actions of our Ancestors do not, as I suppose, savor much of the submission which patrimonial slaves do usually render to the will of their Lord. On the contrary, whatsoever they did was by a power inhe∣rent in themselves to defend that Liberty in which they were born. All their Kings were created upon the same condition, and for the same ends. <HI>Alfred</HI> acknowledg'd he found and left them perfectly free; and the confession of <HI>Offa,</HI> that they had not made him King for his own me∣rits, but for the defence of their Liberty, comprehends all that were before and after him. They well knew how great the honor was, to be made Head of a great People, and rigorously exacted the per∣formance of the ends for which such a one was elevated, severely pu∣nishing those who basely and wickedly betray'd the Trust repos'd in them, and violated all that is most sacred among men; which could not have bin unless they were naturally free, for the Liberty that has no be∣ing cannot be defended.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="34" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXXIV. No Veneration paid, or Honor confer'd upon a just and lawful Magi∣strate, can diminish the Liberty of a Nation.</HEAD>
<P>SOME have suppos'd, that tho the People be naturally free, and Ma∣gistrats created by them, they do by such Creations deprive them∣selves of that natural Liberty; and that the names of <HI>King, Sovereign Lord,</HI> and <HI>Dread Sovereign,</HI> being no way consistent with Liberty, they who give such Titles do renounce it. Our Author carrys this very far, and lays great weight upon the submissive Language us'd by the Peo∣ple, when they <HI>humbly crave that his Majesty would be pleas'd to grant their accustom'd freedom of speech, and access to his Person;</HI> and <HI>give the name of Supplications and Petitions to the Addresses made to him:</HI> Whereas he answers in the haughty Language of <HI>Le Roy le veut, Le Roy s'avisera,</HI> and the like. But they who talk at this rate, shew, that they neither un∣derstand the nature of Magistracy, nor the practice of Nations. Those who have liv'd in the highest exercise of their Liberty, and have bin most tenacious of it, have thought no Honor too great for such Magistrats as were eminent in the defence of their Rights, and set up for that end. The name of Dread Sovereign might justly have bin given to a <HI>Roman</HI> Dictator, or Consul, for they had the Sovereign Authority in their hands, and power sufficient for its execution. Whilst their Magistracy continu'd, they were a terror to the same men, whose Axes and Rods had bin a terror to them the year or month before, and might be so again the next. The <HI>Romans</HI> thought they could not be guilty of excess in carrying the power and veneration due to their Dictator to the highest: And <HI>Livy</HI> tells us, that his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edictum Dictatoris pro numine observatum. <BIBL><HI>Hist.</HI> l. 8.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Edicts were esteem'd sacred.</HI> I have already shewn that this haughty People, who might have commanded, condescended to join with their Tribuns in a Petition to the Dictator <HI>Papirius,</HI> for the Life of <HI>Quintus Fabius,</HI> who had fought a Battel in his absence, and with∣out his order, tho he had gain'd a great and memorable Victory. The same <HI>Fabius,</HI> when Consul, was commended by his Father <HI>Q. Fabius Maximus,</HI>
<PB N="373" REF="381"/>
for obliging him by his Lictors to dismount from his Horse, and to pay him the same respect that was due from others. The Tribuns of the Peo∣ple, who were instituted for the preservation of Liberty, were also e∣steem'd sacred and inviolable, as appears by that phrase, <HI>Sacrosancta Tri∣bunorum potestas,</HI> so common in their antient Writers. No man, I pre∣sume, thinks any Monarchy more limited, or more clearly deriv'd from a delegated Power, than that of the <HI>German</HI> Emperors; and yet <HI>Sacra Caesarea Majestas</HI> is the publick stile. Nay, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at this day call their Burgermasters, tho they see them selling Herring or Tar, <HI>High and Mighty Lords,</HI> as soon as they are advanc'd to be of the 36, 42 or 48 Magistrats of a small Town. 'Tis no wonder therefore, if a great Na∣tion should think it conducing to their own glory, to give magnificent Titles, and use submissive language to that one man, whom they set up to be their Head; most especially, if we consider that they came from a Country where such Titles and Languages were principally invented.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Grecians</HI> we hear nothing of Majesty, High∣ness, Serenity and Excellence appropriated to a single Person, but receive them from <HI>Germany</HI> and other Northern Countrys. We find <HI>Majestas Populi Romani,</HI> and <HI>Majestas Imperii,</HI> in their best Authors; but no man speaking to <HI>Julius</HI> or <HI>Augustus,</HI> or even to the vaniest of their Successors, ever us'd those empty Titles, nor took upon themselves the name of Ser∣vants, as we do to every fellow we meet in the Streets. When such ways of speaking are once introduc'd, they must needs swell to a more than ordinary height in all transactions with Princes. Most of them na∣turally delight in vanity, and Courtiers never speak more truth than when they most extol their Masters, and assume to themselves the names that best express the most abject slavery. These being brought into mode, like all ill Customs, increase by use; and then no man can omit them without bringing that danger and hatred upon himself, which few will un∣dergo, except for something that is evidently of great importance. Mat∣ters of ceremony and title at the first seem not to be so; and being for some time neglected, they acquire such strength as not to be easily re∣mov'd. From private Usage they pass into publick Acts; and those Flatterers who gave a beginning to them, proposing them in publick Councils, where too many of that sort have always insinuated themselves, gain credit enough to make them pass. This work was farther advanc'd by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> according to their custom of favouring that most, which is most vain and corrupt; and it has bin usual with the Popes and their adherents, liberally to gratify Princes for Services render'd to the Church, with Titles that tended only to the prejudice of the people. These poisonous Plants having taken root, grew up so fast, that the Titles, which, within the space of a hundred years, were thought suffi∣cient for the Kings and Queens of <HI>England,</HI> have of late bin given to <HI>Monk</HI> and his honourable Dutchess. New phrases have bin invented to please Princes, or the sense of the old perverted, as has happen'd to that of <HI>Le Roy s' avisera:</HI> And that which was no more than a liberty to con∣sult with the Lords upon a Bill presented by the Commons, is by some men now taken sor a Right inherent in the King of denying such Bills as may be offer'd to him by the Lords and Commons; tho the Coronation Oath obliges him to hold, keep and defend the just Laws and Customs, <HI>quas vulgus elegerit.</HI> And if a stop be not put to this exorbitant abuse, the words still remaining in Acts of Parliament, which shew that their Acts are our Laws, may perhaps be also abolish'd.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="382"/>
 But tho this should come to pass, by the slackness of the Lords and Commons, it could neither create a new Right in the King, nor diminish that of the People: But it might give a better color to those who are Ene∣mys to their Country, to render the Power of the Crown arbitrary, than any thing that is yet among us.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="35" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXXV. The Authority given by our Law to the Acts perform'd by a King <HI>de facto,</HI> detract nothing from the Peoples right of creating whom they please.</HEAD>
<P>THEY who have more regard to the prevailing Power than to Right, and lay great weight upon the Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the se∣venth, which authorizes the Acts of a <HI>King de facto,</HI> seem not to con∣sider, that thereby they destroy all the pretended right of Inheritance; that he only is King <HI>de facto,</HI> who is receiv'd by the People; and that this reception could neither be of any value in it felf, nor be made valid by a Statute, unless the People, and their Representatives who make the Statute, had in themselves the power of receiving, authorizing and cre∣ating whom they please. For he is not King <HI>de facto</HI> who calls himself so, as <HI>Perkin</HI> or <HI>Simnel,</HI> but he who by the consent of the Nation is pos∣sest of the Regal Power. If there were such a thing in nature, as a natu∣ral Lord over every Country, and that the right must go by descent, it would be impossible for any other man to acquire it, or for the people to confer it upon him, and to give the Authority to the Acts of one, who neither is nor can be a King, which belongs only to him who has the right inherent in himself, and inseparable from him. Neither can it be deny'd, that the same power which gives the validity to such Acts as are perform'd by one who is not a King, that belongs to those of a true King, may also make him King; for the essence of a King consists in the validity of his Acts. And 'tis equally absurd for one to pretend to be a King, whose Acts as King are not valid, as that his own can be valid, if those of another are; for then the same indivisible Right which our Author, and those of his principles assert to be inseparable from the Person, would be at the same time exercis'd and enjoy'd by two distinct and contrary Powers.</P>
<P>Moreover, it may be observ'd, that this Statute was made after frequent and bloody Wars concerning Titles to the Crown; and whether the cause were good or bad, those who were overcome, were not only sub∣ject to be kill'd in the field, but afterwards to be prosecuted as Traitors under the color of Law. He who gain'd the Victory, was always set up to be King by those of his party; and he never fail'd to proceed against his Enemys as Rebels. This introduc'd a horrid series of the most de∣structive mischiefs. The Fortune of War vary'd often; and I think it may be said, that there were few, if any, great Familys in <HI>England,</HI> that were not either destroy'd, or at least so far shaken, as to lose their Chiefs, and many considerable branches of them: And experience taught, that instead of gaining any advantage to the Publick in point of Govern∣ment,
<PB N="375" REF="383"/>
he for whom they fought seldom prov'd better than his Enemy. They saw that the like might again happen, tho the title of the reigning King should be as clear as descent of blood could make it. This brought things into an uneasy posture; and 'tis not strange, that both the Nobi∣lity and Commonalty should be weary of it. No Law could prevent the dangers of battel; for he that had followers, and would venture him∣self, might bring them to such a decision, as was only in the hand of God. But thinking no more could justly be requir'd to the full performance of their Duty to the King, than to expose themselves to the hazard of battel for him; and not being answerable for the success, they would not have that Law which they endeavour'd to support, turn'd to their destruction by their Enemys, who might come to be the interpreters of it. But as they could be exempted from this danger only by their own Laws, which could authorize the Acts of a King without a Title, and justify them for acting under him; 'tis evident that the power of the Law was in their hands, and that the acts of the person who enjoy'd the Crown, were of no value in themselves. The Law had bin impertinent, if it could have bin done without Law; and the Intervention of the Parliament useless, if the Kings <HI>de facto</HI> could have given authority to their own Acts. But if the Parliament could make that to have the effect of Law, which was not Law, and exempt those that acted according to it from the penaltys of the Law, and give the same force to the Acts of one who is not King as of one who is, they cannot but have a power of making him to be King, who is not so; that is to say, all depends intirely upon their Au∣thority.</P>
<P>Besides, he is not King who assumes the title to himself, or is set up by a corrupt party; but he who according to the usages requir'd in the case is made King. If these are wanting, he is neither <HI>de facto</HI> nor <HI>de jure,</HI> but <HI>Tyrannus sine Titulo.</HI> Nevertheless, this very man, if he comes to be receiv'd by the People, and plac'd in the Throne, he is thereby made King <HI>de facto.</HI> His Acts are valid in Law; the same service is due to him as to any other: they who render it are in the same manner protected by the Law; that is to say, he is truly King. If our Author therefore do allow such to be Kings, he must confess that power to be good which makes them so, when they have no right in themselves. If he deny it, he must not only deny that there is any such thing as a King <HI>de facto,</HI> which the Statute acknowledges, but that we ever had any King in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> for we never had any other than such, as I have prov'd before.</P>
<P>By the same means he will so unravel all the Law, that no man shall know what he has, or what he ought to do or avoid; and will find no remedy for this, unless he allow, that Laws made without Kings are as good as those made with them, which returns to my purpose: for they who have the power of making Laws, may by Law make a King as well as any other Magistrate. And indeed the intention of this Statute could be no other than to secure mens Persons and Possessions, and so far to de∣clare the power of giving and taking away the Crown to be in the Parlia∣ment, as to remove all disputes concerning Titles, and to make him to be a Legal King, whom they acknowledg to be King.</P>

<HEAD> SECT. XXXVI. The general revolt of a Nation cannot be call'd a Rebellion.</HEAD>
<P>AS Impostors seldom make lies to pass in the world, without putting false names upon things, such as our Author endeavour to persuade the People they ought not to defend their Libertys, by giving the name of Rebellion to the most just and honourable actions that have bin perform'd fer the preservation of them; and to aggravate the matter, tell us that Rebellion is like the sin of Witchcraft. But those who seek after truth, will easily find, that there can be no such thing in the world as the rebel∣lion of a Nation against its own Magistrats, and that Rebellion is not al∣ways evil. That this may appear, it will not be amiss to consider the word, as well as the thing commonly understood by it, as it is us'd in an evil sense.</P>
<P>The word is taken from the Latin <HI>rebellare,</HI> which signifys no more than to renew a war. When a Town or Province had bin subdu'd by the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> and brought under their dominion, if they violated their Faith after the settlement of Peace, and invaded their Masters who had spar'd them, they were said to rebel. But it had bin more absurd to apply that word to the People that rose against the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> Kings or other Magistrats, than to the <HI>Parthians</HI> or any of those Nations who had no dependence upon them; for all the circumstances that should make a Rebellion were wanting, the word implying a superiority in them against whom it is, as well as the breach of an establish'd Peace. But tho every private man singly taken be subject to the commands of the Magistrate, the whole body of the People is not so; for he is by and for the People, and the Peo∣ple is neither by nor for him. The obedience due to him from private men is grounded upon, and measur'd by the General Law; and that Law regarding the welfare of the People, cannot set up the interest of one or a few men against the publick. The whole body therefore of a Na∣tion cannot be ty'd to any other obedience than is consistent with the com∣mon good, according to their own judgment: and having never bin sub∣du'd or brought to terms of peace with their Magistrats, they cannot be said to revolt or rebel against them, to whom they owe no more than seems good to themselves, and who are nothing of or by themselves, more than other men.</P>
<P>Again, the thing signify'd by rebellion is not always evil; for tho eve∣ry subdu'd Nation must acknowledg a superiority in those who have sub∣du'd them, and rebellion dos imply a breach of the peace, yet that supe∣riority is not infinite; the peace may be broken upon just grounds, and it may be neither a crime nor infamy to do it. The <HI>Privernates</HI> had bin more than once subdu'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and had as often rebel'd. Their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. l. 8.</NOTE>City was at last taken by <HI>Plautius</HI> the Consul, after their Leader <HI>Virtu∣vius</HI> and great numbers of their Senat and People had bin kill'd: Being reduc'd to a low condition, they sent Embassadors to <HI>Rome</HI> to desire peace; where when a Senator ask'd them what punishment they deserv'd, one of them answer'd, <HI>The same which they deserve who think themselves worthy of Liberty.</HI> The Consul then demanded, <HI>what kind of Peace might</HI>
<PB N="377" REF="385"/>
<HI>be expected from them, if the punishment should be remitted:</HI> The Embassa∣dor answer'd, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si bonam dederitis, fidam &amp; perpetuam; si malam, haud diuturnam. <BIBL>Liv.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>If the terms you give be good, the Peace will be observ'd by us faithfully and perpetually; if bad, it will soon be broken.</HI> And tho some were offended with the ferocity of the answer, yet the best part of the Senat approv'd it as <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Viri &amp; liberi vocem auditam. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>worthy of a man and a freeman;</HI> and confessing that no Man or Nation would continue under an uneasy condition longer than they were compel'd by force, said, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Eos demum, qui nihil praeterquam de libertate cogitant, dignos esse, qui Romani fiant. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>They only were fit to be made</HI> Romans, <HI>who thought nothing valuable but Liberty.</HI> Upon which they were all made Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> and obtain'd whatsoever they had desir'd.</P>
<P>I know not how this matter can be carry'd to a greater height; for if it were possible, that a People resisting oppression, and vindicating their own Liberty, could commit a crime, and incur either guilt or infamy, the <HI>Privernates</HI> did, who had bin often subdu'd, and often pardon'd; but even in the judgment of their Conquerors whom they had offended, the resolution they profest of standing to no agreement impos'd upon them by necessity, was accounted the highest testimony of such a Vertue as render'd them worthy to be admitted into a Society and equality with themselves, who were the most brave and vertuous people of the world.</P>
<P>But if the patience of a conquer'd People may have limits, and they who will not bear oppression from those who had spar'd their Lives, may deserve praise and reward from their conquerors, it would be madness to think, that any Nation can be oblig'd to bear whatsoever their own Ma∣gistrats think fit to do against them. This may seem strange to those who talk so much of conquests made by Kings; Immunitys, Libertys and Privileges granted to Nations; Oaths of Allegiance taken, and wonder∣ful benefits confer'd upon them. But having already said as much as is needful concerning Conquests, and that the Magistrate who has nothing except what is given to him, can only dispense out of the publick Stock such Franchises and Privileges as he has receiv'd for the reward of Ser∣vices done to the Country, and encouragement of Vertue, I shall at pre∣sent keep my self to the two last points.</P>
<P>Allegiance signifys no more (as the words <HI>ad legem</HI> declare) than such an obedience as the Law requires. But as the Law can require nothing from the whole People, who are masters of it, Allegiance can only relate to particulars, and not to the whole Nation. No Oath can bind any other than those who take it, and that only in the true sense and meaning of it: but single men only take this Oath, and therefore single men are only oblig'd to keep it: the body of a People neither dos, nor can perform any such act: Agreements and Contracts have bin made; as the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and the rest of <HI>Israel</HI> afterward, made a Covenant with <HI>David,</HI> upon which they made him King; but no wise man can think, that the Nation did thereby make themselves the Creature of their own Creature.</P>
<P>The sense also of an Oath ought to be consider'd. No man can by an Oath be oblig'd to any thing beyond, or contrary to the true meaning of it; private men who swear obedience <HI>ad Legem,</HI> swear no obedience <HI>extra</HI> or <HI>contra Legem:</HI> whatsoever they promise or swear, can detract nothing from the publick Liberty, which the Law principally intends to preserve. Tho many of them may be oblig'd in their several Stations and Capacitys to render peculiar services to a Prince, the People continue as sree as the
<PB N="378" REF="386"/>
 internal thoughts of a man, and cannot but have a right to preserve their Liberty, or avenge the violation.</P>
<P>If matters are well examin'd, perhaps not many Magistrats can pretend to much upon the title of merit, most especially if they or their progeni∣tors have continu'd long in Office. The conveniences annex'd to the exercise of the Sovereign power, may be thought sufficient to pay such scores as they grow due, even to the best: and as things of that nature are handled, I think it will hardly be found, that all Princes can pretend to an irresistible power upon the account of beneficence to their People. When the family of <HI>Medices</HI> came to be masters of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> that Country was without dispute, in men, mony and arms, one of the most flourishing Provinces in the World, as appears by <HI>Macchiavel</HI>'s account, and the rela∣tion of what happen'd between <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth and the Magistrats of <HI>Florence,</HI> which I have mention'd already from <HI>Guicciardin.</HI> Now who∣ever shall consider the strength of that Country in those days, together with what it might have bin in the space of a hundred and forty years, in which they have had no war, nor any other plague, than the extortion, fraud, rapin and cruelty of their Princes, and compare it with their pre∣sent desolate, wretched and contemptible condition, may, if he please, think that much veneration is due to the Princes that govern them, but will never make any man believe that their Title can be grounded upon beneficenee. The like may be said of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who pretend∣ing (upon I know not what account) that every Peasant in the Dutchy ought to pay him two Crowns every half year, did in 1662 subtilly find out, that in every year there were thirteen halves; so that a poor man who had nothing but what he gain'd by hard labor, was thro his father∣ly Care and Beneficence, forc'd to pay six and twenty Crowns to his Royal Highness, to be employ'd in his discreet and vertuous pleasures at <HI>Turin.</HI></P>
<P>The condition of the seventeen Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> (and even of <HI>Spain</HI> it self) when they fell to the house of <HI>Austria,</HI> was of the same nature: and I will confess as much as can be requir'd, if any other marks of their Government do remain, than such as are manifest evidences of their Pride, Avarice, Luxury and Cruelty.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> in outward appearance makes a better show; but nothing in this world is more miserable, than that people under the fatherly care of their triumphant Monarch. The best of their condition is, like Asses and Mastiff dogs, to work and fight, to be opprest and kill'd for him; and those among them who have any understanding well know, that their industry, courage, and good success, is not only unprofitable, but de∣structive to them; and that by increasing the power of their Master, they add weight to their own Chains. And if any Prince, or succession of Princes, have made a more modest use of their Power, or more faith∣fully discharg'd the trust repos'd in them, it must be imputed peculiarly to them, as a testimony of their personal Vertue, and can have no effect upon others.</P>
<P>The Rights therefore of Kings are not grounded upon Conquest; the Libertys of Nations do not arise from the Grants of their Princes; the Oath of Allegiance binds no private man to more than the Law directs, and has no influence upon the whole Body of every Nation: Many Prin∣ces are known to their Subjects only by the injurys, losses and mischiefs brought upon them; such as are good and just, ought to be rewarded for their personal Vertue, but can confer no right upon those who no way
<PB N="379" REF="387"/>
resemble them; and whoever pretends to that merit, must prove it by his Actions: Rebellion being nothing but a renew'd War, can never be against a Government that was not establish'd by War, and of it self is neither good nor evil, more than any other War; but is just or unjust ac∣cording to the cause or manner of it. Besides, that Rebellion which by <HI>Samuel</HI> is compar'd to Witchcraft, is not of private men, or a People a∣gainst <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 15. 23.</NOTE>the Prince, but of the Prince against God: The <HI>Israelites</HI> are often said to have rebel'd against the Law, Word, or Command of God; but tho they frequently oppos'd their Kings, I do not find Rebellion imputed to them on that account, nor any ill character put upon such actions. We are told also of some Kings who had bin subdu'd, and afterwards rebel'd against <HI>Chedorlaomer</HI> and other Kings; but their cause is not blam'd, and we have some reason to believe it good, because <HI>Abraham</HI> took part with those who had rebel'd. However it can be of no prejudice to the cause I defend: for tho it were true, that those subdu'd Kings could not justly rise against the person who had subdu'd them; or that generally no King being once vanquish'd, could have a right of Rebellion against his Con∣queror, it could have no relation to the actions of a People vindicating their own Laws and Libertys against a Prince who violates them; for that War which never was, can never be renew'd. And if it be true in any case, that hands and swords are given to men, that they only may be slaves who have no courage, it must be when Liberty is overthrown by those, who of all men ought with the utmost industry and vigor to have defended it.</P>
<P>That this should be known, is not only necessary for the safety of Na∣tions, but advantageous to such Kings as are wise and good. They who know the frailty of human Nature, will always distrust their own; and desiring only to do what they ought, will be glad to be restrain'd from that which they ought not to do. Being taught by reason and experience, that Nations delight in the Peace and Justice of a good Government, they will never fear a general Insurrection, whilst they take care it be rightly administer'd; and finding themselves by this means to be safe, will never be unwilling, that their Children or Successors should be oblig'd to tread in the same steps.</P>
<P>If it be said that this may sometimes cause disorders, I acknowledg it; but no human condition being perfect, such a one is to be chosen, which carrys with it the most tolerable inconveniences: And it being much bet∣ter than the irregularitys and excesses of a Prince should be restrain'd or supprest, than that whole Nations should perish by them, those Consti∣tutions that make the best provision against the greatest evils, are most to be commended. If Governments were instituted to gratify the lusts of one man, those could not be good that set limits to them; but all reasonable men confessing that they are instituted for the good of Nations, they only can deserve praise, who above all things endeavour to procure it, and ap∣point means proportion'd to that end. The great variety of Governments which we see in the World, is nothing but the effect of this care; and all Nations have bin, and are more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or less happy, as they or their Ance∣cestors have had vigor of Spirit, integrity of Manners, and wisdom to invent and establish such Orders, as have better or worse provided for this common Good, which was sought by all. But as no Rule can be so exact, to make provision against all contestations; and all disputes about Right do naturally end in force when Justice is deny'd (ill men never wil∣lingly submitting to any decision that is contrary to their passions and in∣terests) the best Constitutions are of no value, if there be not a Power to
<PB N="380" REF="388"/>
 support them. This Power first exerts it self in the execution of Justice by the ordinary Officers; but no Nation having bin so happy, as not some∣times to produce such Princes as <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Seconds, and such Ministers as <HI>Gaveston, Spencer,</HI> and <HI>Tresilian,</HI> the ordinary Officers of Justice often want the will, and always the power to restrain them. So that the Rights and Libertys of a Nation must be utterly subverted and abolish'd, if the power of the whole may not be employ'd to assert them, or punish the violation of them. But as it is the fundamental Right of every Nation to be govern'd by such Laws, in such Manner, and by such Persons as they think most conducing to their own good, they cannot be accountable to any but themselves for what they do in that most impor∣tant affair.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXVII. The <HI>English</HI> Government was not ill constituted, the defects more lately observ'd proceeding from the change of manners, and corruption of the times.</HEAD>
<P>I Am not ignorant that many honest and good men acknowledging these Rights, and the care of our Ancestors to preserve them, think they wanted wisdom rightly to proportionate the means to the end. 'Tis not enough, say they, for the General of an Army to desire Victory; he only can deserve praise, who has skill, industry, and courage to take the best measures of obtaining it. Neither is it enough for wise Legislators to preserve Liberty, and to erect such a Government as may stand for a time; but to set such clear Rules to those who are to put it in execution, that every man may know when they transgress; and appoint such means for restraining or punishing them, as may be us'd speedily, surely, and ef∣fectually, without danger to the Publick. <HI>Sparta</HI> being thus constituted, we hardly find that, for more than eight hundred years, any King pre∣sum'd to pass the limits prescrib'd by the Law. If any <HI>Roman</HI> Consul grew insolent, he might be reduc'd to order without blood, or danger to the Publick; and no Dictator ever usurp'd a power over Liberty till the time of <HI>Sylla,</HI> when all things in the City were so chang'd, that the an∣tient foundations were become too narrow. In <HI>Venice</HI> the power of the Duke is so circumscrib'd, that in 1300 years, no one except <HI>Falerio</HI> and <HI>Tiepoli,</HI> has dar'd to attempt any thing against the Laws: and they were immediately supprest with little commotion in the City. On the other side, our Law is so ambiguous, perplext and intricate, that 'tis hard to know when 'tis broken. In all the publick contests we have had, men of good judgment and integrity have follow'd both partys. The means of transgressing and procuring Partizans to make good by force the most no∣torious violations of Liberty, have bin so easy, that no Prince who has endeavour'd it, ever fail'd to get great numbers of followers, and to do in∣finite mischiefs before he could be remov'd. The Nation has bin brought to sight against those they had made to be what they were, upon the un∣equal terms of hazarding all against nothing. If they had success, they gain'd no more than what was their own before, and which the Law ought to have secur'd: whereas 'tis evident, that if at any one time the contrary
<PB N="381" REF="389"/>
had happen'd, the Nation had bin utterly enslav'd; and no victory was ever gain'd without the loss of much noble and innocent blood.</P>
<P>To this I answer, that no right judgment can be given of human things, without a particular regard to the time in which they pass'd. We esteem <HI>Scipio, Hannibal, Pyrrhus, Alexander, Epimanondas</HI> and <HI>Cesar,</HI> to have bin admirable Commanders in War, because they had in a most eminent degree all the qualitys that could make them so, and knew best how to employ the Arms then in use according to the disciplin of their times; and yet no man doubts, that if the most skilful of them could be rais'd from the Grave, restor'd to the utmost vigor of mind and body, set at the head of the best Armys he ever commanded, and plac'd upon the Frontiers of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI> he would not know how to advance or retreat, nor by what means to take any of the places in those parts, as they are now fortify'd and defended; but would most certainly be beaten by any in∣significant fellow with a small number of men, furnish'd with such Arms as are now in use, and following the methods now practis'd. Nay, the manner of marching, encamping, besieging, attacking, defending and fighting, is so much alter'd within the last threescore years, that no man observing the disciplin that was then thought to be the best, could possibly defend himself against that which has bin since found out, tho the terms are still the same. And if it be consider'd that political matters are sub∣ject to the same mutations (as certainly they are) it will be sufficient to excuse our Ancestors, who suting their Government to the Ages in which they liv'd, could neither foresee the changes that might happen in fu∣ture Generations, nor appoint remedys for the mischiefs they did not foresee.</P>
<P>They knew that the Kings of several Nations had bin kept within the limits of the Law, by the vertue and power of a great and brave Nobi∣lity; and that no other way of supporting a mix'd Monarchy had ever bin known in the World, than by putting the balance into the hands of those who had the greatest interests in Nations, and who by Birth and Estate enjoy'd greater advantages than Kings could confer upon them for rewards of betraying their Country. They knew that when the No∣bility was so great as not easily to be number'd, the little that was left to the King's disposal, was not sufficient to corrupt many; and if some might fall under the temptation, those who continu'd in their integrity, would easily be able to chastise them for deserting the publick Cause, and by that means deter Kings from endeavouring to seduce them from their duty. Whilst things continu'd in this posture, Kings might safely be trusted (with the advice of their Council) to confer the commands of the Militia in Towns and Provinces upon the most eminent men in them: And whilst those Kings were exercis'd in almost perpetual Wars, and plac'd their glory in the greatness of the Actions they atchiev'd by the power and valor of their People, it was their interest always to chuse such as seem'd best to deserve that honor. It was not to be imagin'd that thro the weakness of some, and the malice of others, those Dignitys should by degrees be turn'd into empty Titles, and become the rewards of the great∣est crimes, and the vilest services; or that the noblest of their Descendents for want of them, should be brought under the name of Commoners, and depriv'd of all privileges except such as were common to them with their Grooms. Such a stupendous change being in process of time insensibly introduc'd, the foundations of that Government which they had establish'd, were remov'd, and the superstructure overthrown. The balance by which
<PB N="382" REF="390"/>
 it subsisted was broken; and 'tis as impossible to restore it, as for most of those who at this day go under the name of Noblemen, to perform the du∣tys requir'd from the antient Nobility of <HI>England.</HI> And tho there were a charm in the name, and those who have it should be immediately fill'd with a spirit like to that which animated our Ancestors, and endeavor to deserve the Honors they possess, by such Services to the Country as they ought to have perform'd before they had them, they would not be able to accomplish it. They have neither the Interest nor the Estates re∣quir'd for so great a work. Those who have Estates at a rack Rent, have no dependents. Their Tenants, when they have paid what is agreed, owe them nothing; and knowing they shall be turn'd out of their Tene∣ments, as soon as any other will give a little more, they look upon their Lords as men who receive more from them than they confer upon them. This dependence being lost, the Lords have only more mony to spend or lay up than others, but no command of men; and can therefore neither protect the weak, nor curb the insolent. By this means all things have bin brought into the hands of the King and the Commoners, and there is nothing left to cement them, and to maintain the union. The perpe∣tual jarrings we hear every day; the division of the Nation into such fa∣ctions as threaten us with ruin, and all the disorders that we see or fear, are the effects of this rupture. These things are not to be imputed to our original Constitutions, but to those who have subverted them: And if they who by corrupting, changing, enervating and annihilating the No∣bility, which was the principal support of the antient regular Monarchy, have driven those who are truly Noblemen into the same interest and name with the Commons, and by that means increas'd a party which never was, and I think never can be united to the Court, they are to answer for the Consequences; and if they perish, their destruction is from themselves.</P>
<P>The inconveniences therefore proceed not from the Institution, but from the Innovation. The Law was plain, but it has bin industriously render'd perplex: They who were to have upheld it are overthrown. That which might have bin easily perform'd when the People was arm'd, and had a great, strong, vertuous and powerful Nobility to lead them, is made dif∣ficult, now they are disarm'd, and that Nobility abolish'd. Our Ance∣stors may evidently appear, not only to have intended well, but to have taken a right course to accomplish what they intended. This had effect as long as the cause continu'd; and the only fault that can be ascrib'd to that which they establish'd is, that it has not prov'd to be perpetual; which is no more than may be justly said of the best human Constitutions that ever have bin in the world. If we will be just to our Ancestors, it will become us in our time rather to pur∣sue what we know they intended, and by new Constitutions to re∣pair the breaches made upon the old, than to accuse them of the defects that will for ever attend the Actions of men. Taking our Affairs at the worst, we shall soon find, that if we have the same spirit they had, we may easily restore our Nation to its antient Liberty, Dignity and Happi∣ness; and if we do not, the fault is owing to our selves, and not to any want of vertue and wisdom in them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXVIII. The power of calling and dissolving Parliaments is not simply in the King. The variety of Customs in chusing Parliament men, and the Errors a People may commit, neither prove that Kings are or ought to be Absolute.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE original of Magistratical Power, the intention of our Ancestors in its creation, and the ways prescrib'd for the direction and limi∣tation of it may, I presume, sufficiently appear by what has bin said. But because our Author, taking hold of every twig, pretends,</HI> That Kings may call and dissolve Parliaments at their pleasure, <HI>and from thence infers</HI> the Power to be wholly in them; <HI>alledges</HI> the various Customs in several parts of this Nation us'd in the Elections of Parliament men, to procced from the King's will; <HI>and</HI> because a People may commit Errors, <HI>thinks</HI> all Power ought to be put into the hands of the King:</P>
<P>I answer, 1. That the Power of calling and dissolving Parliaments is not simply in Kings. They may call Parliaments, if there be occasion, at times when the Law dos not exact it; they are plac'd as Sentinels, and ought diligently to observe the motions of the Enemy, and give notice of his approach: But if the Sentinel falls asleep, neglects his duty, or mali∣ciously endeavors to betray the City, those who are concern'd may make use of all other means to know their danger, and to preserve themselves. The ignorance, incapacity, negligence or luxury of a King, is a great calamity to a Nation, and his malice is worse, but not an irreparable ruin. Remedys may be, and often have bin found against the worst of their Vices. The last <HI>French</HI> Kings of the Races of <HI>Meroveus</HI> and <HI>Pe∣pin</HI> brought many mischiefs upon the Kingdom, but the destruction was prevented. <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Seconds of <HI>England</HI> were not un∣like them, and we know by what means the Nation was preserv'd. The question was not who had the Right, or who ought to call Parliaments, but how the Commonwealth might be sav'd from ruin. The Con∣suls, or other chief Magistrats in <HI>Rome,</HI> had certainly a right of assem∣bling and dismissing the Senat: But when <HI>Hannibal</HI> was at the Gates, or any other imminent danger threaten'd them with destruction; if that Magistrate had bin drunk, mad, or gain'd by the Enemy, no wise man can think that formalitys were to have bin observ'd. In such cases eve∣ry Man is a Magistrate; and he who best knows the danger, and the means of preventing it, has a right of calling the Senat or People to an Assembly. The People would, and certainly ought to follow him, as they did <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Valerius</HI> against <HI>Tarquin,</HI> or <HI>Horatius</HI> and <HI>Va∣lerius</HI> against the <HI>Decemviri;</HI> and whoever should do otherwise, might for sottishness be compar'd to the Courtiers of the two last Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> The first of these, by name <HI>Philip</HI> the Third, being indispos'd in cold weather, a <HI>Braziero</HI> of Coals was brought into his Chamber, and plac'd so near to him, that he was cruelly scorch'd. A Nobleman then present said to one who stood by him, <HI>The King burns;</HI> the other answer'd, it was true, but the Page whose Office it was to bring and re∣move
<PB N="384" REF="392"/>
 the <HI>Braziero,</HI> was not there; and before he could be found, his Majesty's Legs and Face were so burnt, that it caus'd an <HI>Erysipelas,</HI> of which he dy'd. <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth escap'd not much better, who being surpriz'd as he was hunting by a violent storm of Rain and Hail, and no man presuming to lend the King a Cloke, he was so wet before the Offi∣cer could be found who carry'd his own, that he took a cold, which cast him into a dangerous Fever. If Kings like the consequences of such a Re∣gularity, they may cause it to be observ'd in their own Familys; but Nations looking in the first place to their own safety, would be guilty of the most extreme stupidity, if they should suffer themselves to be ruin'd for adhering to such Ceremonys.</P>
<P>This is said upon a supposition, that the whole power of calling and dis∣solving Parliaments is by the Law plac'd in the King: but I utterly deny that it is so; and to prove it, shall give the following Reasons.</P>
<P>(1.) That the King can have no such Power, unless it be given to him, for every man is originally free; and the same power that makes him King, gives him all that belongs to his being King. 'Tis not therefore an inhe∣rent, but a delegated Power; and whoever receives it, is accountable to those that gave it; for, as our Author is forc'd to confess, <HI>they who give Authority by Commission, do always retain more than they grant.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) The Law for annual Parliaments expresly declares it not to be in the King's power, as to the point of their meeting, nor consequently their continuance. For they meet to no purpose if they may not continue to do the work for which they meet: and it were absurd to give them a power of meeting, if they might not continue till it be done: For, as <HI>Gro∣tius</HI> says, <HI>Qui dat finem, dat media ad finem necessaria.</HI> The only reason why Parliaments do meet, is to provide for the publick good; and they by Law ought to meet for that end. They ought not therefore to be dis∣solv'd, till it be accomplish'd. For this reason the opinion given by <HI>Tre∣silian,</HI> that Kings might dissolve Parliaments at their pleasure, was adjudg'd to be a principal part of his Treason.</P>
<P>(3.) We have already prov'd, that <HI>Saxons, Danes, Normans,</HI> &amp;c. who had no Title to the Crown, were made Kings by Micklegemots, Witte∣nagemots, and Parliaments; that is, either by the whole People, or their Representatives: Others have bin by the same Authority restrain'd, brought to order, or depos'd. But as it is impossible that such as were not Kings, and had no title to be Kings, could by virtue of a kingly Power call Parliaments, when they had none; and absurd to think that such as were in the Throne, who had not govern'd according to Law, would suffer themselves to be restrain'd, imprison'd, or depos'd by Parliaments, call'd and sitting by themselves, and still depending upon their will to be or not to be: 'Tis certain that Parliaments have in themselves a Power of sitting and acting for the publick Good.</P>
<P>2. To the second. The various customs us'd in Elections are nothing to this question. In the Countys, which make up the Body of the Na∣tion, all Freeholders have their Votes: these are properly <HI>Cives,</HI> Mem∣bers of the Commonwealth, in distinction from those who are only <HI>Incolae,</HI> or Inhabitants, Villains, and such as being under their Parents, are not yet <HI>sui juris.</HI> These in the beginning of the <HI>Saxons</HI> reign in <HI>England,</HI> compos'd the Micklegemots; and when they grew to be fo numerous that one place could not contain them, or so far dispers'd, that without trouble and danger they could not leave their habitations, they deputed such as should represent them. When the Nation came to
<PB N="385" REF="393"/>
be more polish'd, to inhabit Citys and Towns, and to set up several Arts and Trades; those who exercis'd them were thought to be as useful to the Commonwealth, as the Freeholders in the Country, and to deserve the same Privileges. But it not being reasonable that every one should in this case do what he pleas'd, it was thought fit that the King with his Council (which always consisted of the <HI>Proceres</HI> and <HI>Magnates Regni)</HI> should judg what numbers of men, and what places deserv'd to be made Corporations or Bodys Politick, and to enjoy those Privileges; by which he did not confer upon them any thing that was his, but according to the trust repos'd in him, did dispense out of the publick Stock parcels of what he had receiv'd from the whole Nation: And whether this was to be enjoy'd by all the Inhabitants, as in <HI>Westminster;</HI> by the Common Hall, as in <HI>London;</HI> or by the Mayor, Aldermen, Jurats and Corpora∣tion, as in other places, 'tis the same thing: for in all these cases the King dos only distribute, not give, and under the same condition that he might call Parliaments, that is, for the publick good. This indeed increases the Honor of the person intrusted, and adds weight to the obligation incumbent upon him; but can never change the nature of the thing, so as to make that an inherent, which is only a delegated Power. And as Parliaments, when occasion requir'd, have bin assembled, have refus▪d to be dissolv'd till their work was finish'd, have severely punish'd those who went about to persuade Kings, that such matters depended abso∣lutely upon their will, and made Laws to the contrary: 'tis not to be imagin'd, that they would not also have interpos'd their Authority in matters of Charters, if it had bin observ'd that any King had notoriously abus'd the trust repos'd in him, and turn'd the Power to his private ad∣vantage, with which he was intrusted for the publick good.</P>
<P>That which renders this most plain and safe, is, that men chosen in this manner to serve in Parliament, do not act by themselves, but in conjunction with others who are sent thither by prescription; nor by a Power deriv'd from Kings, but from those that chuse them. If it be true therefore that those who delegate Powers, do always retain to themselves more than they give, they who send these men, do not give them an absolute power of doing whatsoever they please, but retain to themselves more than they confer upon their Deputys: They must therefore be ac∣countable to their Principals, contrary to what our Author asserts. This continues in force, tho he knows not, that <HI>any Knights and Burgesses have ever bin question'd by those that sent them;</HI> for it cannot be concluded they ought not, or may not be question'd, because none have bin question'd. But in truth they are frequently question'd: The People do perpetually judg of the behaviour of their Deputys. Whensoever any of them has the mis∣fortune not to satisfy the major part of those that chose him, he is sure to be rejected with disgrace the next time he shall desire to be chosen. This is not only a sufficient punishment for such faults, as he who is but one of five hundred may probably commit, but as much as the greatest and freest People of the World did ever inflict upon their Commanders that brought the greatest losses upon them. <HI>Appius Claudius, Pomponius,</HI> and <HI>Terentius Varro,</HI> surviv'd the greatest defeats that ever the <HI>Romans</HI> suffer'd; and tho they had caus'd them by their folly and perversness, were never punish'd. Yet I think no man doubts that the <HI>Romans</HI> had as much right over their own Officers, as the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> who frequently put them to death. They thought the mind of a Com∣mander would be too much distracted, if at the same time he should
<PB N="386" REF="394"/>
 stand in fear both of the Enemy and his own Countrymen: And as they always endeavour'd to chuse the best men, they would lay no other ne∣cessity upon them of performing their duty, than what was suggested by their own vertue and love to their Country. 'Tis not therefore to be thought strange, if the people of <HI>England</HI> have follow'd the most ge∣nerous and most prosperous Examples. Besides, if any thing has bin de∣fective in their usual proceedings with their Delegats, the inconvenience has bin repair'd by the modesty of the best and wisest of them that were chosen. Many in all Ages, and sometimes the whole body of the Com∣mons have refus'd to give their opinion in some cases, till they had con∣sulted with those that sent them: The House have bin often adjourn'd to give them time to do it; and if this were done more frequently, or that the Towns, Citys and Countys, had on some occasions given instructions to their Deputys, matters would probably have gone better in Parliament than they have often done.</P>
<P>3. The question is not, whether the Parliament be impeccable or in∣fallible, but whether an Assembly of Nobility, with a House of Com∣mons compos'd of those who are best esteem'd by their Neighbors in all the Towns and Countys of <HI>England,</HI> are more or less subject to error or corruption, than such a man, woman or child as happens to be next in blood to the last King. Many men do usually see more than one; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 11. 14.</NOTE>if we may believe the wisest King, <HI>In the multitude of Counsellors there is safety.</HI> Such as are of mature Age, good Experience, and approv'd re∣putation for Vertue and Wisdom, will probably judg better than children or fools. Men are thought to be more fit for War than women; and those who are bred up in Disciplin, to understand it better than those who never knew any thing of it. If some Countys or Citys fail to chuse such men as are eminently capable, all will hardly be so mistaken as to chuse those who have no more of Wisdom or Vertue, than is usually intail'd upon Familys. But <HI>Filmer</HI> at a venture admires the profound Wisdom of the King; tho besides such as we have known, Historys give us too many proofs, that all those who have bin possest of Crowns, have not excel'd that way. He speaks of Kings in general, and makes no difference between <HI>Solomon</HI> and his foolish Son. He distinguishes not our <HI>Edward</HI> the first from <HI>Edward</HI> the second; <HI>Edward</HI> the third from <HI>Richard</HI> the second; or <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth from <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. And because all of them were Kings, all of them, if he deserves credit, must needs have bin endow'd with profound Wisdom. <HI>David</HI> was wise as an Angel of God; therefore the present Kings of <HI>France, Spain</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> must have bin so also, when they were but five years old: <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Castille</HI> could not be mad, nor the two <HI>Joans</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> infamous Strumpets, or all his Arguments fall to the ground. For tho <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Wisdom surpast that of all the people, yet men could not rely equally upon that of <HI>Reho∣boam,</HI> unless it had bin equal. And if they are all equal in Wisdom when they come to be equally Kings, <HI>Perses</HI> of <HI>Macedon</HI> was as great a Captain as <HI>Philip</HI> or <HI>Alexander; Commodus</HI> and <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> were as wise and ver∣tuous as <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> and <HI>Antoninus Pius:</HI> Nay, <HI>Christina</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> in her infancy was as fit to command an Army as her valiant Father. If this be most absurd and false, there can be neither reason nor sense in proposing, as our Author dos, that the Power should be in the King, be∣cause the Parliament is not infallible. <HI>It is,</HI> says he, <HI>for the Head to cor∣rect, and not to expect the consent of the Members or Partys peccant to be Judges in their own cases; nor is it needful to confine the King,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="387" REF="395"/>
Besides that this is directly contrary to his own fundamental Maxim, that no man must be the Judg of his own case, in as much as this would put the Power into the King's hands, to decide the Controversys between himself and the people, in which his own Passions, private Interest, and the corrupt Counsels of ill Ministers, will always lead him out of the way of Justice, the inconveniences that may arise from a possibility that the Parliament or People is not infallible, will be turn'd to the most cer∣tain and destructive mischiefs; as must have fallen out in <HI>Spain,</HI> if, upon a supposition that the Estates of <HI>Castille</HI> might err, the correction of such Errors had bin left to the profound Wisdom and exquisit Judgment of <HI>Joan</HI> their Queen and Head, who was stark mad. And the like may be said of many other Princes, who thro natural or accidental infirmitys, want of age, or dotage, have bin utterly unable to judg of any thing.</P>
<P>The matter will not be much mended, tho I pass from Ideots and Luna∣ticks, to such as know well enough how to clothe and feed themselves, and to perform the ordinary functions of life; and yet have bin as unca∣pable of giving a right judgment concerning the weighty matters of Go∣vernment, as the weakest of Children, or the most furious of Madmen. Good manners forbid me to enumerate the examples of this kind, which <HI>Europe</HI> has produc'd even in this Age: But I should commit a greater fault, if I did in silence pass over the extravagances of those, who being most weak in judgment, and irregular in their appetites, have bin most impatient of any restraint upon their will. The brave <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> and his Nephew <HI>Carolus Gustavus,</HI> who was not inferior to him in Valor, Wisdom, and love to his people, were content with the Power that the Laws of their Country gave to them: But <HI>Frederick</HI> the fourth of <HI>Den∣mark</HI> never rested till he had overthrown the Liberty of that Nation. <HI>Casimir</HI> by attempting the like in <HI>Poland,</HI> lost almost half that Kingdom; and flying from the other, left all to be ravag'd by <HI>Swedes, Tartars,</HI> and <HI>Cosacks.</HI> The present Emperor, who pass'd his time in setting Songs in Musick with a wretched Italian Eunuch, when he ought to have bin at the Head of a brave Army, rais'd to oppose the Turks in the year 1664, and which under good conduct might have overthrown the Ottoman Empire, as soon as he was deliver'd from the fear of that Enemy, fell upon his own Subjects with such cruelty, that they are now forc'd to fly to the Turks for protection; the Protestants especially, who find their condition more tolerable under those profest Enemys to Christianity, than to be expos'd to the pride, avarice, perfidiousness and violence of the Jesuits by whom he is govern'd. And the qualitys of the King of <HI>Portu∣gal</HI> are so well known, together with the condition to which he would have brought his Kingdom if he had not bin sent to the <HI>Tercera</HI>'s, that I need not speak particularly of him.</P>
<P>If Kings therefore, by virtue of their Office, are constituted Judges over the body of their People, because the People, or Parliaments repre∣senting them, are not infallible; those Kings who are children, fools, disabled by age, or madmen, are so also; women have the same right where they are admitted to the succession; those men who, tho of ripe age and not superannuated, nor directly fools or madmen, yet absolutely uncapable of judging important Affairs, or by their passions, interests, vices, or the malice and wickedness of their Ministers, Servants and Fa∣vorites, are set to oppress and ruin the people, enjoy the same privilege: than which nothing can be imagin'd more absurd and abominable, nor more directly tending to the corruption and destruction of the Nations

<HEAD>SECT. XXXIX. Those Kings only are heads of the People, who are good, wise, and seek to advance no Interest but that of the Publick.</HEAD>
<P>THE worst of men seldom arrive to such a degree of impudence, as plainly to propose the most mischievous follys and enormitys. They who are enemys to Vertue, and fear not God, are afraid of men, and dare not offer such things as the world will not bear, lest by that means they should overthrow their own designs. All poison must be disguis'd, and no man can be persuaded to eat Arsenic, unless it be co∣ver'd with something that appears to be harmless. <HI>Creusa</HI> would have abhor'd <HI>Medea</HI>'s present, if the pestilent venom had not bin hidden by the exterior lustre of Gold and Gems. The Garment that destroy'd <HI>Hercules</HI> appear'd beautiful; and <HI>Eve</HI> had neither eaten of the forbidden Tree, nor given the Fruit to her Husband, if it had not seem'd to be good and pleasant, and she had not bin induc'd to believe that by eating it they should both be as Gods. The Servants of the Devil have always follow'd the same method: their malice is carry'd on by fraud, and they have sel∣dom destroy'd any, but such as they had first deceiv'd. Truth can never conduce to mischief, and is best discover'd by plain words; but nothing is more usual with ill men than to cover their mischievous designs with figurative phrases. It would be too ridiculous to say in plain terms, that all Kings without distinction are better able to judg of all matters than any or all their people; they must therefore be call'd <HI>the Head,</HI> that thereby they may be invested with all the preeminences which in a natu∣ral body belong to that part; and men must be made to believe the ana∣logy between the natural and political body to be perfect. But the mat∣ter must be better examin'd before this mortal poison seems fit to be swallow'd.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Head</HI> is figuratively us'd both in Scripture and profane Au∣thors in several senses, in relation to places or persons, and always im∣plys something of real or seeming preeminence in point of honor or ju∣risdiction. Thus <HI>Damascus</HI> is said to be the head of <HI>Syria; Samaria</HI> of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and <HI>Ephraim</HI> of the ten Tribes: that is, <HI>Ephraim</HI> was the chief <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 5.</NOTE>Tribe; <HI>Samaria</HI> was the chief City of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and <HI>Damascus</HI> of <HI>Syria:</HI> tho it be certain that <HI>Ephraim</HI> had no jurisdiction over the other Tribes, nor <HI>Samaria</HI> over the other Citys of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> but every one according to the Law had an equal power within it self, or the Territorys belonging to it; and no privileges were granted to one above another, except to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in the matter of Religion, because the Temple was plac'd there.</P>
<P>The words Head, Prince, principal Man, or Captain, seem also to be equivocal; and in this sense the same men are call'd Heads of the Tribes, Princes in the houses of their Fathers: and 'tis said, that two hundred Heads of the Tribe of <HI>Reuben</HI> were carry'd away captive by <HI>Tiglath Pilezer,</HI> and proportionably in the other Tribes; which were a strange thing, if the word did imply that supreme, absolute and infinite Power that our Author attributes to it: and no man of less understanding
<PB N="389" REF="397"/>
than he, can comprehend how there should be two hundred or more sovereign unlimited Powers in one Tribe, most especially when 'tis certain that one series of Kings had for many Ages reign'd over that Tribe and nine more; and that every one of those Tribes, as well as the particular Citys, even from their first entrance into the promis'd Land, had a full jurisdiction within it self. When the <HI>Gileadites</HI> came to <HI>Jephtha,</HI> he suspected them, and ask'd whether indeed they intended to make him <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 12.</NOTE>their Head? they answer'd, if he would lead them against the <HI>Ammo∣nites,</HI> he should be their Head. In the like sense when <HI>Jul. Caesar</HI> in despair would have kill'd himself, one of his Soldiers dissuaded him from that design, by telling him, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>Cum tot ab hac anima populorum vita salus{que}</L>
<L>Pendeat, &amp; tantus caput hoc sibi fecerit orbis,</L>
<L>Savitia est voluisse mori. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></L>
</LG></NOTE> <HI>That the safety of so many Nations that had made him their Head, depending upon his life, it would be cruelty in him to take such a resolution.</HI> But for all that, when this Head was taken off, the Body did still subsist: upon which I observe many fundamental diffe∣rences between the relation of this figurative Head (even when the word is rightly apply'd) and that of the natural Head to their respective Bodys.</P>
<P>The figurative Heads may be many, the natural but one.</P>
<P>The People make or create the figurative Head; the natural is from it self, or connate with the Body.</P>
<P>The natural Body cannot change or subsist without the natural Head; but a People may change and subsist very well without the artificial. Nay, if it had bin true, that the World had chosen <HI>Cesar,</HI> as it was not, (for he was chosen only by a factious mercenory Army, and the soundest part so far oppos'd that Election, that they brought him to think of kil∣ling himself) there could have bin no truth in this flattering assertion, <HI>That the safety of the whole depended upon his Life:</HI> for the World could not only subsist without him, but without any such Head, as it had done before he by the help of his corrupted Soldiery had usurp'd the Power; which also shews that a civil Head may be a matter of convenience, but not of necessity. Many Nations have had none; and if the expression be so far stretch'd, as to make it extend to the annual or temporary Ma∣gistrats set up by the <HI>Athenians, Carthaginians, Romans,</HI> and other antient Commonwealths, or to those at this day in <HI>Venice, Holland, Switzerland,</HI> and other places, it must be confest that the People who made, depos'd, abrogated, or abolish'd both the Magistrats and Magistracys, had the power of framing, directing and removing their Heads, which our Author will say is most absurd. Yet they did it without any prejudice to themselves, and very often much to their advantage.</P>
<P>In mentioning these vast and essential differences between the natural and political Head, I no way intend to exclude others that may be of equal weight; but as all figurative expressions have their strength only from similitude, there can be little or none in this, which differs in so many im∣portant points, and can therefore be of no effect.</P>
<P>However, Right proceeds from identity, and not from similitude. The right of a man over me is by being my Father, and not by being like my Father. If I had a Brother so perfectly resembling me as to deceive our Parents, which has sometimes happen'd to Twins, it could give him no right to any thing that is mine. If the power therefore of correcting the partys peccant, which our Author attributes to Kings, be grounded
<PB N="390" REF="398"/>
 upon the name of Head, and a resemblance between the Heads of the Body politick and Body natural; if this resemblance be found to be ex∣ceedingly imperfect, uncertain, or perhaps no way relating to the matter in question; or tho it did, and were absolutely perfect, could confer no right; the allegation of it is impertinent and absurd.</P>
<P>This being clear'd, 'tis time to examin what the Office of the Head is in a natural Body, that we may learn from thence why that name is sometimes given to those who are eminent in political Bodys, and to whom it dos belong.</P>
<P>Some men account the Head to be so absolutely the seat of all the Senses, as to derive even that of feeling, which is exercis'd in every part, from the Brain: but I think 'tis not doubted that all the rest have both their seat and function in the Head; and whatsoever is useful or hurtful to a man, is by them represented to the understanding; as <HI>Aristotle</HI> says, <HI>Nihil est in intellectu, quod non sit prius in sensu.</HI> This is properly the part of every Magistrate: He is the Sentinel of the Publick, and is to represent what he discovers beneficial or hurtful to the Society; which Office belongs not only to the supreme, but proportionably to the subor∣dinate. In this sense were the chief men among the <HI>Israelites</HI> call'd <HI>Heads</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 7. 40.</NOTE><HI>of their Fathers house, choice and mighty men of valor, chief of the Princes.</HI> And in the following Chapter mention is made of <HI>nine hundred and fifty Benjamites, chief men in the House of their Fathers.</HI> These men exercis'd a charitable care over such as were inferior to them in power and valor, without any shadow of sovereignty, or possibility that there could be so many Sovereigns: and such as were under their care are said to be their Brethren; which is not a word of majesty and domination, but of dear∣ness and equality. The name therefore of Head may be given to a Sove∣reign, but it implys nothing of sovereignty; and must be exercis'd with charity, which always terminates in the good of others. The Head can∣not correct or chastise; the proper work of that part is only to indicate, and he who takes upon him to do more, is not the Head. A natural body is homogeneous, and cannot subsist if it be not so. We cannot take one part of a Horse, another of a Bear, and put upon them the head of a Lion; for it would be a Monster, that would have neither action nor life. The Head must be of the same nature with the other Members, or it cannot subsist. But the Lord or Master differs <HI>in specie</HI> from his Ser∣vants and Slaves, he is not therefore properly their Head.</P>
<P>Besides, the Head cannot have a subsistence without the Body, nor any interest contrary to that of the Body; and 'tis impossible for any thing to be good for the Head, that is hurtful to the Body. A Prince therefore, or Magistrate, who sets up an interest in himself distinct from, or repugnant to that of the people, renounces the title or quality of their Head. In∣deed <HI>Moses</HI> was the Head of the <HI>Israelites;</HI> for when God threaten'd to destroy that People, and promis'd to make him a great Nation, he wav'd the particular advantages offer'd to himself, interceded for them, and pro∣cur'd their pardon. Yet he was not able to bear the weight of the Govern∣ment alone, but desir'd that some might be appointed to assist him. <HI>Gideon</HI> was the Head of the same people, but he would not reign himself, nor suffer his Sons to reign over them. <HI>Samuel</HI> was also their Head; he took nothing from any man, defrauded none, took bribes from no man, op∣prest none: God and the People were his witnesses: He blam'd them for their Rebellion against God in asking a King, but was no way concern'd for himself or his Family. <HI>David</HI> likewise had a right to that Title; for
<PB N="391" REF="399"/>
he desir'd that God would spare the People, and turn the effect of his an∣ger against himself, and the house of his Father. But <HI>Rehoboam</HI> was not their Head; for tho he acknowledg'd that his Father had laid a heavy yoke upon them, yet he told them he would add to the weight; and that if his Father had chastis'd them with Whips, he would chastise them with Scorpions. The Head is no burden to the Body, and can lay none upon it; the Head cannot chastise any member; and he who dos so, be it more or less, cannot be the Head. <HI>Jeroboam</HI> was not the Head of the revolting Tribes; for the Head takes care of the Members, and provides for the safety of the whole: But he thro fear that the people, going to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to worship, should return to the house of <HI>David,</HI> by setting up Idols to secure his own interests, drew guilt and destruction upon them. Tho it should be granted that <HI>Augustus</HI> by a gentle use of his power, had in a manner expiated the detestable Villanys committed in the acquisition, and had truly deserv'd to be call'd the Head of the <HI>Romans;</HI> yet that title could no way belong to <HI>Caligula, Claudius, Nero</HI> or <HI>Vitellius,</HI> who neither had the qualitys requir'd in the Head, nor the understanding or will to perform the office. Nay, if I should carry the matter farther, and acknowledg that <HI>Brutus, Cincinnatus, Fabius, Camillus,</HI> and others, who, in the time of their annual or shorter Magistracys, had by their vigilance, vertue, and care to preserve the City in safety, and to provide for the publick good, perform'd the office of the Head, and might de∣serve the name; I might justly deny it to the greatest Princes that have bin in the world, who having their power for life, and leaving it to de∣scend to their children, have wanted the Vertues requir'd for the perfor∣mance of their duty: And I should less fear to be guilty of an absurdity in saying, that a Nation might every year change its Head, than that he can be the Head, who cares not for the Members, nor understands the things that conduce to their good, most especially if he sets up an Interest in himself against them. It cannot be said that these are imaginary cases, and that no Prince dos these things; for the proof is too easy, and the examples too numerous. <HI>Caligula</HI> could not have wish'd the <HI>Romans</HI> but one Head, that he might cut it off at once, if he had bin that Head, and had advanc'd no Interest contrary to that of the Members. <HI>Nero</HI> had not burnt the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> if his concernments had bin inseparably uni∣ted to those of the people. He who caus'd above three hundred thousand of his innocent unarm'd Subjects to be murder'd, and fill'd his whole Kingdom with fire and blood, did set up a personal Interest repugnant to that of the Nation; and no better testimony can be requir'd to shew that he did so, than a Letter written by his Son, to take off the penalty due to one of the chief Ministers of those crueltys, for this reason, that what he had done, was <HI>by the command and for the service of his Royal Father.</HI> King <HI>John</HI> did not pursue the advantage of his people, when he endea∣vour'd to subject them to the Pope or the <HI>Moors.</HI> And whatever Prince seeks assistance from foreign Powers, or makes Leagues with any stranger or enemy for his own advantage against his people, however secret the Treaty may be, declares himself not to be the Head, but an enemy to them. The Head cannot stand in need of an exterior help against the Bo∣dy, nor subsist when divided from it. He therefore that courts such an assistance, divides himself from the Body; and if he dos subsist, it must be by a lise he has in himself, distinct from that of the Body, which the Head cannot have.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="400"/>
 But besides these enormitys, that testify the most wicked rage and fury in the highest degree, there is another practice, which no man that knows the world can deny to be common with Princes, and incompatible with the nature of a Head. The Head cannot desire to draw all the nourish∣ment of the Body to it self, nor more than a due proportion. If the rest of the parts are sick, weak or cold, the Head suffers equally with them; and if they perish, must perish also. Let this be compar'd with the actions of many Princes we know, and we shall soon see which of them are Heads of their people. If the Gold brought from the <HI>Indys</HI> has bin equally distributed by the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> to the body of that Nation, I consent they may be call'd the Heads. If the Kings of <HI>France</HI> assume no more of the Riches of that great Kingdom than their due proportion, let them also wear that honourable name. But if the naked backs and empty bellys of their miserable Subjects evince the contrary, it can by no means belong to them. If those great Nations wast and languish; if nothing be so common in the best Provinces belonging to them, as misery, famin, and all the effects of the most outrageous oppression, whilst their Princes and Favorites possess such treasures as the most wanton prodiga∣lity cannot exhaust; if that which is gain'd by the sweat of so many millions of men, be torn out of the mouths of their starving Wives and Children, to foment the vices of those luxurious Courts, or reward the Ministers of their lusts, the nourishment is not distributed equally to all the parts of the Body; the oeconomy of the whole is overthrown, and they who do these things, cannot be the Heads, nor parts of the Body, but something distinct from and repugnant to it. 'Tis not therefore he who is found in, or advanc'd to the place of the Head, who is truly the Head: 'Tis not he who ought, but he who dos perform the office of the Head, that deserves the name and privileges belonging to the Head. If our Author therefore will persuade us that any King is Head of his People, he must do it by Arguments peculiarly relating to him, since those in general are found to be false. If he say that the King as King may direct or correct the people, and that the power of determining all controversys must be refer'd to him, because they may be mistaken, he must show that the King is infallible; for unless he dos so, the wound is not cur'd. This also must be by some other way, than by saying he is their Head; for such Powers belong not to the office of the Head, and we see that all Kings do not deserve that Name: Many of them want both understanding and will to perform the functions of the Head; and many act directly contrary in the whole course of their Government. If any therefore among them have merited the glorious name of Heads of Nations, it must have bin by their personal Vertues, by a vigilant care of the good of their People, by an inseparable conjunction of interests with them, by an ardent love to every member of the Society, by a mode∣ration of spirit affecting no undue Superiority, or assuming any singular advantage which they are not willing to communicate to every part of the political Body. He who finds this merit in himself, will scorn all the advantages that can be drawn from misapply'd names: He that knows such honor to be peculiarly due to him for being the best of Kings, will ne∣ver glory in that which may be common to him with the worst. Nay, whoever pretends by such general discourses as these of our Author, to ad∣vance the particular Interests of any one King, dos either know he is of no merit, and that nothing can be said for him which will not as well agree with the worst of men; or cares not what he says so he may do mischief;
<PB N="393" REF="401"/>
and is well enough contented, that he who is set up by such Maxims as a publick plague, may fall in the ruin he brings upon the people.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XL. Good Laws prescribe easy and safe Remedys against the Evils proceeding from the vices or infirmitys of the Magistrate; and when they fail, they must be supply'd.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who desire to advance the power of the Magistrate above the Law, would persuade us, that the difficultys and dangers of inquiring into his actions, or opposing his will when employ'd in violence and injustice, are so great, that the remedy is always worse than the dis∣ease; and that 'tis better to suffer all the evils that may proceed from his infirmitys and vices, than to hazard the consequences of displeasing him. But on the contrary, I think and hope to prove,</P>
<P>1. That in well▪constituted Governments, the remedys against ill Ma∣gistrats are easy and safe.</P>
<P>2. That 'tis good, as well for the Magistrate as the People, so to con∣stitute the Government, that the Remedys may be easy and safe.</P>
<P>3. That how dangerous and difficult soever they may be thro the de∣fects of the first Constitution, they must be try'd.</P>
<P>To the first: 'Tis most evident that in well-regulated Governments these Remedys have bin found to be easy and safe. The Kings of <HI>Sparta</HI> were not suffer'd in the least to deviate from the rule of the Law: And <HI>Theopompus</HI> one of those Kings, in whose time the <HI>Ephori</HI> were created, and the regal Power much restrain'd, doubted not to affirm, that it was by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch.</NOTE>that means become more lasting and more secure. <HI>Pausanias</HI> had not the name of King, but commanded in the War against <HI>Xerxes</HI> with more than regal Power; nevertheless being grown insolent, he was without any trouble to that State banish'd and afterwards put to death. <HI>Leonidas</HI> Fa∣ther of <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> was in the like manner banish'd. The second <HI>Agis</HI> was most unjustly put to death by the <HI>Ephori,</HI> for he was a brave and a good Prince; but there was neither danger nor difficulty in the action. Many of the <HI>Roman</HI> Magistrats, after the expulsion of the Kings, seem to have bin desirous to extend their Power beyond the bounds of the Law; and perhaps some others as well as the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> may have design'd an absolute Tyranny; but the first were restrain'd, and the others without much difficulty supprest. Nay, even the Kings were so well kept in order, that no man ever pretended to the Crown unless he were chosen, nor made any other use of his Power than the Law permitted, except the last <HI>Tarquin,</HI> who by his insolence, avarice and cruelty, brought ruin upon himself and his family. I have already mention'd one or two Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> who were not less ambitious, but their crimes return'd upon their own heads, and they perish'd without any o∣ther danger to the State than what had pass'd before their Trea∣sons were discover'd. Infinite examples of the like nature may be alledg'd; and if matters have not at all times, and in all places, suc∣ceeded in the same manner, it has bin because the same courses were
<PB N="394" REF="402"/>
 not every where taken; for all things do so far follow their cau∣ses, that being order'd in the same manner, they will always produce the same effects.</P>
<P>2. To the second: Such a regulation of the magistratical Power is not at all grievous to a good Magistrate. He who never desires to do any thing but what he ought, cannot desire a Power of doing what he ought not, nor be troubled to find he cannot do that which he would not do if he could. This inability is also advantageous to those who are evil or un∣wise; that since they cannot govern themselves, a Law may be impos'd upon them, lest by following their own irregular will, they bring de∣struction upon themselves, their familys and people, as many have done. If <HI>Apollo</HI> in the Fable had not bin too indulgent to <HI>Phaeton,</HI> in granting his ill conceiv'd request, the furious Youth had not brought a necessity upon <HI>Jupiter,</HI> either of destroying him, or suffering the world to be de∣stroy'd by him.</P>
<P>Besides, good and wise men know the weight of Sovereign Power, and misdoubt their own strength. Sacred and human Historys furnish us with many examples of those who have fear'd the lustre of a Crown. Men that find in themselves no delight in doing mischief, know not what thoughts may insinuate into their minds, when rais'd too much above their Sphere. They who were able to bear adversity, have bin precipitated into ruin by prosperity. When the Prophet told <HI>Hazael</HI> the Villanys he would commit, he answer'd, <HI>Is thy Servant a dog, that I should do these things?</HI> but yet he did them. I know not where to find an ex∣ample of a man more excellently qualify'd than <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Macedon;</HI> but he sell under the weight of his own fortune, and grew to exceed those in vice, whom he had conquer'd by his vertue. The nature of man can hardly suffer such violent changes without being disorder'd by them; and every one ought to enter into a just diffidence of himself, and fear the temp∣tations that have destroy'd so many. If any man be so happily born, so carefully educated, so establish'd in vertue, that no storm can shake him, nor any poison corrupt him, yet he will consider he is mortal; and know∣ing no more than <HI>Solomon,</HI> whether his Son shall be a wise man or a fool, he will always fear to take upon him a power, which must prove a most pestilent evil both to the person that has it, and to those that are under it, as soon as it shall fall into the hands of one, who either knows not how to use it, or may be easily drawn to abuse it. Supreme Magistrats always walk in obscure and slippery places: but when they are advanc'd so high, that no one is near enough to support, direct or restrain them, their fall is inevitable and mortal. And those Nations that have wanted the prudence rightly to balance the powers of their Magistrats, were frequently oblig'd to have recourse to the most violent remedys, and with much difficulty, danger and blood, to punish the crimes which they might have prevented. On the other side, such as have bin more wise in the constitution of their Governments, have always had regard to the frailty of human nature, and the corruption reigning in the hearts of men; and being less liberal of the power over their lives and libertys, have reserv'd to themselves so much as might keep their Magistrats within the limits of the Law, and oblige them to perform the ends of their Institution. And as the Law which denounces severe penaltys for crimes, is indeed merciful both to ill men, who are by that means deter▪d from committing them; and to the good, who otherwise vvould be destroy'd; so those Nations
<PB N="395" REF="403"/>
that have kept the reins in their hands, have by the same act provided as well for the safety of their Princes as for their own. They who know the Law is well defended, seldom attempt to subvert it: they are not easi∣ly tempted to run into excesses, when such bounds are set, as may not safely be transgrest; and whilst they are by these means render'd more moderate in the exercise of their Power, the People are exempted from the odious necessity of suffering all manner of indignitys and miserys from their Princes, or by their destruction to prevent or avenge them.</P>
<P>3. To the third: If these Rules have not bin well observ'd in the first constitution, or from the changes of times, corruption of manners, insen∣sible encroachments, or violent usurpations of Princes, have bin render'd ineffectual, and the People expos'd to all the calamitys that may be brought upon them by the weakness, vices and malice of the Prince, or those who govern him, I confess the remedys are more difficult and dangerous: but even in those cases they must be try'd. Nothing can be fear'd that is worse than what is suffer'd, or must in a short time fall upon those who are in this condition. They who are already fallen into all that is odious, shame∣ful and miserable, cannot justly fear. When things are brought to such a pass, the boldest counsels are the most safe; and if those must <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moriendum victis, moriendum deditis: id solum interest, an inter cruciatus &amp; ludibria, an per virtutem expiremus. <BIBL>C. Tacit.</BIBL> Quod si nocentes innocentes{que} idem exitus maneat, acrioris viri est merit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perire. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>perish who lie still, and they can but perish who are most active, the choice is easily made. Let the danger be never so great, there is a possibility of safety, whilst men have life, hands, arms, and courage to use them; but that People must certainly perish, who tamely suffer themselves to be op∣prest, either by the injustice, cruelty and malice of an ill Magistrate, or by those who prevail upon the vices and infirmitys of weak Princes. 'Tis in vain to say, that this may give occasion to men of raising tumults or ci∣vil war; for tho these are evils, yet they are not the greatest of evils. Ci∣vil War in <HI>Macchiavel</HI>'s account is a Disease, but Tyranny is the Death of a State. Gentle ways are first to be us'd, and 'tis best if the work can be done by them; but it must not be left undone if they fail. 'Tis good to use supplications, advices and remonstrances; but those who have no re∣gard to Justice, and will not hearken to Counsel, must be constrain'd. 'Tis folly to deal otherwise with a man who will not be guided by Reason, and a Magistrate who despises the Law: or rather to think him a man, who rejects the essential principle of a man; or to account him a Magi∣strate who overthrows the Law by which he is a Magistrate. This is the last result; but those Nations must come to it, which cannot otherwise be preserv'd. <HI>Nero</HI>'s madness was not to be cur'd, nor the mischievous ef∣fects of it any otherwise to be supprest than by his death. He who had spar'd such a Monster when it was in his power to remove him, had brought destruction upon the whole Empire; and by a foolish clemency made himself the Author of his future villanys. This would have bin yet more clear, if the World had then bin in such a temper as to be capable of an intire liberty. But the antient foundations had bin over∣thrown, and nothing better could be built upon the new, than some∣thing that might in part resist that torrent of iniquity, which had over∣flow'd the best part of the World, and give Mankind a little time to breath under a less barbarous Master. Yet all the best men did join in the work that was then to be done, tho they knew it would prove
<PB N="396" REF="404"/>
 but imperfect. The Sacred History is not without examples of this kind: When <HI>Ahab</HI> had subverted the Law, set up false Witnesses and corrupt Judges to destroy the innocent, kill'd the Prophets, and esta∣blish'd Idolatry, his house must then be cut off, and his blood be lick'd up by dogs. When matters are brought to this pass, the decision is easy. The question is only, Whether the punishment of crimes shall fall upon one or a few Persons who are guilty of them, or upon a whole Nation that is innocent. If the Father may not dy for the Son, nor the Son for the Father, but every one must bear the penalty of his own crimes, it would be most absurd to punish the People for the guilt of Princes. When the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> was sent Embassador to Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> by the E∣states of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to justify their proceedings against <HI>Mary</HI> their Queen, whom they had oblig'd to renounce the Government; he alledg'd a∣mongst other things the murder of her Husband plainly prov'd against her; asserted the antient Right and Custom of that Kingdom, of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Animadvertendi in reges.</NOTE>exa∣mining the actions of their Kings; by which means, he said, many had bin <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Morte, vinculis &amp; exilio puniti. <BIBL>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t. l. <HI>20.</HI></BIBL> Qui tot reges regno exuerunt, exilio damnarunt, carceribus coerc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erunt, supplicio deni{que} affe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erunt, nec unquam tamen de acerbitate le∣gis m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nuenda mentio est facta, &amp;c. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL> Faci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e apparet regnum miu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iud esse, quam mutuam in∣ter regem &amp; populum stipulationem.

This Discourse, which is set down at large by the Hi∣storian cited on the Margin, being of such strength in it self as never to have bin any otherwise answer'd than by railing, and no way disap∣prov'd by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> or her Council to whom it was made, ei∣ther upon a general account of the pretensions of Princes to be exemp∣ted from the penaltys of the Law, or any pretext that they had parti∣cularly misapply'd them in relation to their Queen; I may justly say, that when Nations fall under such Princes as are either utterly uncapable of making a right use of their Power, or do maliciously abuse that Autho∣rity with which they are entrusted, those Nations stand oblig'd, by the duty they owe to themselves and their posterity, to use the best of their endeavors to remove the evil, whatever danger or difficultys they may meet with in the performance. <HI>Pontius</HI> the <HI>Samnite</HI> said as truly as bravely to his Countrymen, That <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Justa pia{que} sunt arma, quibus necessaria, &amp; necessaria, quib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lla n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i in armis spes est salu∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. <BIBL><HI>T. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> lib. 8.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>those Arms were just and pious that were ne∣cessary, and necessary when there was no hope of safety by any other way.</HI> This is the voice of Mankind, and is dislik'd only by those Princes, who fear the deserv'd punishments that may fall upon them; or by their Servants and Flatterers, who being for the most part the authors of their crimes, think they shall be involv'd in their ruin.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLI. The People for whom and by whom the Magistrate is created, can only judg whether he rightly perform his Office or not.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS commonly said, that no man ought to be the Judg of his own case; and our Author lays much weight upon it as a fun∣damental Maxim, tho according to his ordinary inconstancy he over∣throws it in the case of Kings, where it ought to take place if in any; for it often falls out that no men are less capable of forming a right judgment than they. Their passions and interests are most powerful to disturb or pervert them. No men are so liable to be diverted from Justice by the flatterys of corrupt Servants. They never act as Kings, except for those by whom and for whom they are created; and acting for others, the account of their actions cannot depend upon their own will. Never∣theless I am not afraid to say, that naturally and properly a man is the judg of his own concernments. No one is or can be depriv'd of this pri∣vilege, unless by his own consent, and for the good of that Society into which he enters. This Right therefore must necessarily belong to every man in all cases, except only such as relate to the good of the Communi∣ty, for whose sake he has devested himself of it. If I find my self af∣flicted with hunger, thirst, weariness, cold, heat, or sickness, 'tis a folly to tell me, I ought not to seek meat, drink, rest, shelter, refreshment, or physick, because I must not be the judg of my own case. The like may be said in relation to my house, land, or estate; I may do what I please with them, if I bring no damage upon others. But I must not set fire to my house, by which my Neighbour's house may be burnt. I may not erect Forts upon my own Lands, or deliver them to a foreign Ene∣my, who may by that means infest my Country. I may not cut the Banks of the Sea, or those of a River, lest my Neighbour's Ground be overflown, because the Society into which I am incorporated, would by such means receive prejudice. My Land is not simply my own, but up∣on condition that I shall not thereby bring damage upon the Publick, by which I am protected in the peaceable enjoyment and innocent use of what I possess. But this Society leaves me a liberty to take Servants, and put them away at my pleasure. No man is to direct me, of what qua∣lity or number they shall be, or can tell me whether I am well or ill serv'd by them. Nay, the State takes no other cognizance of what pas∣ses between me and them, than to oblige me to perform the contracts I make, and not to do that to them which the Law forbids: that is to say, the Power to which I have submitted my self, exercises that jurisdiction over me, which was establish'd by my consent, and under which I enjoy all the benefits of Life, which are of more advantage to me than my Li∣berty could have bin, if I had retain'd it wholly in my self. The nature also and measure of this submission must be determin'd by the reasons that induc'd me to it. The Society in which I live cannot subsist unless by rule; the equality in which men are born is so perfect, that no man will suffer his natural Liberty to be abridg'd, except others do the like: I cannot rea∣sonably expect to be defended from wrong, unless I oblige my sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to do none; or to suffer the punishment prescrib'd by the Law, if I perform not
<PB N="398" REF="406"/>
 my engagement. But without prejudice to the Society into which I en∣ter, I may and do retain to my self the Liberty of doing what I pleasein all things relating peculiarly to my self, or in which I am to seek my own convenience.</P>
<P>Now if a private man is not subject to the judgment of any other, than those to whom he submits himself for his own safety and convenience; and notwithstanding that submission, still retains to himself the right of ordering according to his own will all things merely relating to him∣self, and of doing what he pleases in that which he dos for his own sake; the same right must more certainly belong to whole Nations. When a controversy happens between <HI>Caius</HI> and <HI>Seius</HI> in a matter of Right, neither of them may determin the cause, but it must be refer'd to a Judg superior to both; not because 'tis not fit that a man should be judg of his own case, but because they have both an equal Right, and neither of them ows any subjection to the other. But if there be a contest between Me and my Servant concerning my Service, I only am to decide it: He must serve me in my own way, or be gone if I think fit, tho he serves me never so well; and I do him no wrong in putting him away, if either I intend to keep no Servant, or find that another will please me better. I cannot therefore stand in need of a Judg, unless the contest be with one who lives upon an equal foot with me. No man can be my Judg, unless he be my Superior; and he cannot be my Su∣perior, who is not so by my consent, nor to any other purpose than I con∣sent to. This cannot be the case of a Nation, which can have no equal within it self. Controversys may arise with other Nations, the decision of which may be left to Judges chosen by mutual agreement; but this relates not to our Question. A Nation, and most especially one that is powerful, cannot recede from its own Right; as a private man from the knowledg of his own weakness and inability to defend himself, must come under the protection of a greater Power than his own. The strength of a Nation is not in the Magistrate, but the strength of a Magistrate is in the Nation. The wisdom, industry and valor of a Prince may add to the glory and greatness of a Nation, but the foundation and substance will al∣ways be in it self. If the Magistrate and People were upon equal terms, as <HI>Caius</HI> and <HI>Seius,</HI> receiving equal and mutual advantages from each other, no man could be judg of their differences, but such as they should set up for that end. This has bin done by many Nations. The antient <HI>Germans</HI> refer'd the decision of the most difficult matters to their Priests: the <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Britans</HI> to the <HI>Druides:</HI> the <HI>Mahometans</HI> for some Ages to the Califs of <HI>Babylon:</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> when they had embrac'd the Christian Religion, to their Clergy. Whilst all <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> lay under the Popish Superstition, the decision of such matters was fre∣quently assum'd by the Pope; men often submitted to his judgment, and the Princes that resisted were for the most part excommunicated, depos'd, and destroy'd. All this was done for the same reasons. These men were accounted holy and inspir'd, and the Sentence pronounc'd by them was u∣sually reverenc'd as the Judgment of God, who was thought to direct them; and all those who refus'd to submit, were esteem'd execrable. But no man, or number of men, as I think, at the institution of a Magistrate, did ever say, If any difference happen between you or your Successors and us, it be shall determin'd by your self or by them, whether they be men, women, children, mad, foolish, or vicious. Nay, if any such thing had bin,
<PB N="399" REF="407"/>
the folly, turpitude and madness of such a sanction or stipulation must necessarily have destroy'd it. But if no such thing was ever known, or could have no effect if it had bin in any place, 'tis most absurd to impose it upon all. The People therefore cannot be depriv'd of their natural rights upon a frivolous pretence to that which never was and never can be. They who create Magistracys, and give to them such name, form and power as they think fit, do only know, whether the end for which they were created, be perform'd or not. They who give a being to the power which had none, can only judg whether it be employ'd to their welfare, or turn'd to their ruin. They do not set up one or a few men, that they and their posterity may live in splendor and greatness, but that Justice may be administer'd, Vertue establish'd, and provision made for the publick safety. No wise man will think this can be done, if those who set themselves to overthrow the Law, are to be their own Judges. If <HI>Caligula, Nero, Vitellius, Domitian,</HI> or <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> had bin subject to no other judgment, they would have compleated the destruction of the Empire. If the disputes between <HI>Durstus, Evenus</HI> the third, <HI>Dar∣dannus,</HI> and other Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the Nobility and People, might have bin determin'd by themselves, they had escap'd the punish∣ments they suffer'd, and ruin'd the Nation as they design'd. Other methods were taken; they perish'd by their madness; better Princes were brought into their places, and their Successors were by their exam∣ple admonish'd to avoid the ways that had prov'd fatal to them. If <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the second of <HI>England</HI> with <HI>Gaveston</HI> and the <HI>Spencers, Richard</HI> the second with <HI>Tresilian</HI> and <HI>Vere,</HI> had bin permitted to be the Judges of their own cases, they who had murder'd the best of the Nobility would have pursu'd their designs to the destruction of such as remain'd, the enslaving of the Nation, the subversion of the Constitution, and the establishment of a mere Tyranny in the place of a mix'd Monarchy. But our Ancestors took better measures: They who had felt the smart of the vices and follys of their Princes, knew what remedys were most fit to be apply'd, as well as the best time of applying them. They found the effects of extreme corruption in Government to be so desperately pernicious, that Nations must necessarily perish, unless it be corrected, and the State reduc'd to its first principle, or alter'd. Which being the case, it was as easy for them to judg, whether the Governor who had introduc'd that corruption should be brought to order, or remov'd if he would not be reclaim'd; or whether he should be suffer'd to ruin them and their posterity; as it is for me to judg, whether I should put away my Servant, if I knew he intended to poison or murder me, and had a certain facility of accomplishing his design; or whether I should continue him in my service till he had perform'd it. Nay, the matter is so much the more plain on the side of the Nation, as the disproportion of merit between a whole people, and one or a few men entrusted with the power of governing them, is greater than between a private man and his servant. This is so fully confirm'd by the general consent of mankind, that we know no Government that has not frequently either bin alter'd in form, or reduc'd to its original purity, by changing the familys or persons who abus'd the power with which they had bin entrusted. Those who have wanted Wisdom and Vertue rightly and seasonably to perform this, have bin soon destroy'd; like the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> who by omitting to curb the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mariana.</NOTE>fury of <HI>Witza</HI> and <HI>Rodrigo</HI> in time, became a prey to the <HI>Moors.</HI> Their Kingdom, by this means destroy'd, was never restor'd; and the remain∣der
<PB N="400" REF="408"/>
 of that Nation, joining with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they had kept in subjection for three or four Ages, could not in less than eight hun∣dred years, expel those enemys they might have kept out, only by removing two base and vitious Kings. Such Nations as have bin so corrupted, that when they have apply'd themselves to seek reme∣dys to the evils they suffer'd by wicked Magistrats, could not fall upon such as were proportionable to the disease, have only vented their Passions in destroying the immediate instruments of their op∣pression, or for a while delay'd their utter ruin. But the root still remaining, it soon produc'd the same poisonous fruit, and either quite destroy'd, or made them languish in perpetual misery. The <HI>Roman</HI> Empire was the most eminent example of the first; many of the monsters that had tyranniz'd over them were kill'd, but the grea∣test advantage gain'd by their death, was a respite from ruin; and the Government, which ought to have bin establish'd by good Laws, depending only upon the Vertue of one man, his Life prov'd to be no more than a lucid interval, and at his death they relaps'd into the depth of Infamy and Misery: and in this condition they continu'd till that Empire was totally subverted.</P>
<P>All the Kingdoms of the <HI>Arabians, Medes, Persians, Moors,</HI> and others of the East, are of the other sort. Common sense instructs them, that barbarous pride, cruelty, and madness grown to extre∣mity, cannot be born: but they have no other way than to kill the Tyrant, and to do the like to his Successor if he falls into the same crimes. Wanting that Wisdom and Valor which is requir'd for the institution of a good Government, they languish in perpetual slavery, and propose to themselves nothing better than to live under a gentle Master, which is but a precarious life, and little to be valu'd by men of bravery and spirit. But those Nations that are more generous, who set a higher value upon Liberty, and better understand the ways of preserving it, think it a small matter to destroy a Tyrant, unless they can also destroy the Tyranny. They endeavour to do the work thorowly, either by changing the Government intirely, or reform∣ing it according to the first institution, and making such good Laws as may preserve its integrity when reform'd. This has bin so fre∣quent in all the Nations (both antient and modern) with whose actions we are best acquainted, as appears by the foregoing examples, and many others that might be alledg'd if the case were not clear, that there is not one of them which will not furnish us with many instances; and no one Magistracy now in being which dos not owe its original to some Judgment of this nature. So that they must either derive their right from such actions, or confess they have none at all, and leave the Nations to their original Liberty of setting up those Magi∣stracys which best please themselves, without any restriction or obligati∣on to regard one person or family more than another.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLII. The Person that wears the Crown cannot determin the Affairs which the Law refers to the King.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author, with the rest of the vulgar, seems to have bin led in∣to gross errors by the form of Writs summoning persons to appear before the King. The common stile us'd in the trial of Delinquents; the name of the King's Witnesses given to those who accuse them; the Ver∣dicts brought in by Jurys, <HI>coram domino Rege,</HI> and the prosecution made in the King's name, seem to have caus'd this. And they who understand not these Phrases, render the Law a heap of the most gross absurditys, and the King an Enemy to every one of his Subjects, when he ought to be a Father to them all; since without any particular consideration or examination of what any Witness deposes in a Court of Justice, tending to the death, confiscation, or other punishment of any man, he is call'd the King's Witness whether he speak the truth or a lie, and on that ac∣count favor'd. 'Tis not necessary to alledg many instances in a case that is so plain; but it may not be amiss to insert two or three of the most important reasons to prove my assertion.</P>
<P>1. If the Law did intend that he or she who wears the Crown, should in his or her person judg all causes, and determin the most difficult questi∣ons, it mnst like our Author presume that they will always be of pro∣found wisdom to comprehend all of them, and of perfect integrity al∣ways to act according to their understanding. Which is no less than to lay the foundation of the Government upon a thing merely contingent, that either never was, or very often fails, as is too much verify'd by ex∣perience, and the Historys of all Nations; or else to refer the decision of all to those who thro the infirmitys of age, sex or person, are often unca∣pable of judging the least, or subject to such passions and vices as would divert them from Justice tho they did understand it; both which seem to be almost equally preposterous.</P>
<P>2. The Law must also presume that the Prince is always present in all the places where his name is us'd. The King of <HI>France</HI> is (as I have said already) esteem'd to be present <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sur son lit de justice.</NOTE><HI>on the seat of Justice</HI> in all the Parliaments and sovereign Courts of the Kingdom: and if his corporeal Presence were by that phrase to be understood, he must be in all those distinct and far distant places at the same time; which absurdity can hardly be parallel'd, unless by the Popish opinion of <HI>Transubstantiation.</HI> But indeed they are so far from being guilty of such monstrous absurdity, that he cannot in person be present at any trial, and no man can be judg'd if he be. This was plainly asserted to <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th</HI> (when he would have bin at the Trial of the Duke of <HI>Candale)</HI> by the President <HI>de Bellievre,</HI> who told him that as he could judg no man himself, so they could not judg any if he were present: upon which he retir'd.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="410"/>
 3. The Laws of most Kingdoms giving to Kings the Confiscation of Delinquents estates, if they in their own persons might give judgment upon them, they would be constituted both Judges and Partys; which, besides the foremention'd incapacitys to which Princes are as much sub∣ject as other men, would tempt them by their own personal interest to subvert all manner of Justice.</P>
<P>This therefore not being the meaning of the Law, we are to inquire what it is; and the thing is so plain that we cannot mistake, unless we do it wilfully. Some name must be us'd in all manner of Transactions, and in matters of publick concernment none can be so fit as that of the prin∣cipal Magistrate. Thus are Leagues made, not only with Kings and Em∣perors, but with the Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Avoyer and Senat of a Canton in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and the Burgermaster of an Imperial Town in <HI>Germany,</HI> and the States General of the United Provinces. But no man thinking, I presume, these Leagues would be of any value, if they could only oblige the Persons whose names are us'd, 'tis plain that they do not stipulate only for themselves; and that their stipulations would be of no value if they were merely personal. And nothing can more certainly prove they are not so, than that we certainly know, those Dukes, Avoyers and Burgermasters can do nothing of themselves. The power of the States-General of the United Provinces is limited to the points mention'd in the Act of Union made at <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI> The Empire is not oblig'd by any stipulation made by the Emperor without their consent. Nothing is more common than for one King making a League with another, to ex∣act a confirmation of their Agreement, by the Parliaments, Diets or Ge∣neral <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jur. Bel. l. 3.</NOTE>Estates; because, says <HI>Grotius,</HI> a <HI>Prince dos not stipulate for himself, but for the People under his Government;</HI> and <HI>a King depriv'd of his King∣dom, loses the right of sending an Embassador.</HI> The Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> shew'd themselves to be of this opinion in the case of <HI>Portugal.</HI> When <HI>Philip</HI> the second had gain'd the possession, they treated with him concerning the affairs relating to that Kingdom: Few regarded <HI>Don Antonio;</HI> and no man consider'd the Dukes of <HI>Savoy, Parma</HI> or <HI>Braganza,</HI> who perhaps had the most plausible Titles: But when his Grandson <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth had lost that Kingdom, and the People had set up the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> they all treated with him as King. And the English Court, tho then in amity with <HI>Spain,</HI> and not a little influenc'd by a Spanish faction, gave example to others, by treating with him and not with <HI>Spain</HI> touching mat∣ters relating to that State. Nay, I have bin inform'd by those who well understood the Affairs of that time, that the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> advising the late King not to receive any persons sent from the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> Re∣bel to his Ally the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the quality of Embassadors; the King answer'd, that he must look upon that person to be King of <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> who was acknowledg'd by the Nation. And I am mistaken if his Majesty now reigning did not find all the Princes and States of the world to be of the same mind, when he was out of his Kingdom, and could oblige no man but himself and a few followers by any Treaty he could make.</P>
<P>For the same reason the names of Kings are us'd in Treatys, when they are either Children, or otherwise uncapable of knowing what Alliances are fit to be made or rejected; and yet such Treatys do equally oblige them, their Successors and People, as if they were of mature age and fit for government, No man therefore ought to think it strange, if the King's name be us'd in domestick affairs, of which he neither
<PB N="403" REF="411"/>
ought nor can take any cognizance. In these cases he is perpetually a Minor: he must suffer the Law to take its due course; and the Judges, thonominated by him, are oblig'd by Oath not to have any re∣gard to his Letters or personal Commands. If a Man be su'd, he must appear; and a Delinquent is to be try'd <HI>coram rege,</HI> but no otherwise than <HI>secundum legem terrae, according to the Law of the Land,</HI> not the King's personal will or opinion. And the judgments given must be executed, whether they please him or not, it being always understood that he can speak no otherwise than the Law speaks, and is always present as far as the Law requires. For this reason a noble Lord who was irregularly de∣tain'd in prison in 1681, being by <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> brought to the Bar of the King's Bench, where he su'd to be releas'd upon bail; and an igno∣rant Judg telling him he must apply himself to the King, he reply'd, that he came thither for that end; that the King might eat, drink, or sleep where he pleas'd, but when he render'd Justice he was always in that place. The King that renders Justice is indeed always there; he never sleeps; he is subject to no infirmity; he never dies unless the Nation be extin∣guish'd, or so dissipated as to have no Government. No Nation that has a sovereign Power within it self, dos ever want this King. He was in <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> as well as at <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Susa;</HI> and is as proper∣ly said to be now in <HI>Venice, Switzerland</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> as in <HI>France, Morocco</HI> or <HI>Turky.</HI> This is he to whom we all owe a simple and unconditional obe∣dience. This is he <HI>who never dos any wrong:</HI> 'Tis before him we appear, when we demand Juice, or render an account of our actions. All Jurys give their verdict in his sight: They are his Commands that the Judges are bound and sworn to obey, when they are not at all to consider such as they receive from the person that wears the Crown. 'Twas for Trea∣son against him that <HI>Tresilian,</HI> and others like to him in several ages were hang'd. They gratify'd the lusts of the visible Powers, but the invisible King would not be mock'd. He caus'd Justice to be executed upon <HI>Emp∣son</HI> and <HI>Dudley.</HI> He was injur'd when the perjur'd wretches, who gave that accurs'd Judgment in the case of Shipmony, were suffer'd to escape the like punishment by means of the ensuing troubles which they had chiefly rais'd. And I leave it to those who are concern'd, to consider how many in our days may expect vengeance for the like crimes.</P>
<P>I should here conclude this point, if the power of granting a <HI>Noli proseq: Cesset Processus,</HI> and Pardons which are said to be annex'd to the person of the King, were not taken for a proof that all proceedings at Law depend upon his will. But whoever would from hence draw a general conclusion must first prove his proposition to be universally true. If it be wholly false, no true deduction can be made; and if it be true only in some cases, 'tis absurd to draw from thence a general conclusion; and to erect a vast fabrick upon a narrow foundation is impossible. As to the ge∣neral proposition, I utterly deny it. The King cannot stop any Suit that I begin in my own name, or invalidate any Judgment I obtain up∣on it: He cannot release a Debt of ten shillings due to me, nor a Sen∣tence for the like sum given upon an action of Battery, Assault, Trespass, publick Nuisance, or the like. He cannot pardon a man condemn'd up∣on an Appeal, nor hinder the person injur'd from appealing. His power therefore is not universal: if it be not universal, it cannot be inherent, but confer'd upon him, or entrusted by a superior Power that limits it.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="412"/>
 These limits are fix'd by the Law, the Law therefore is above him. His proceedings must be regulated by the Law, and not the Law by his will. Besides, the extent of those limits can only be known by the inten∣tion of the Law that sets them; and are so visible, that none but such as are wilfully blind can mistake. It cannot be imagin'd that the Law, which dos not give a power to the King of pardoning a man that breaks my hedg, can intend he should have power to pardon one who kills my father, breaks my house, robs me of my goods, abuses my children and servants, wounds me, and brings me in danger of my life. Whatever power he has in such cases, is founded upon a presumption, that he who has sworn not to deny or delay justice to any man, will not break his Oath to inter∣rupt it. And farther, as he dos nothing but what he may rightly do, <HI>cum magnatum &amp; sapientum consilio;</HI> and that 'tis suppos'd, they will never advise him to do any thing, but what ought to be done, in order to at∣tain the great ends of the Law, Justice, and the publick safety: never∣theless lest this should not be sufficient to keep things in their due order, or that the King should forget his Oath, not to delay or deny justice to any man, his Counsellors are expos'd to the severest punishments, if they advise him to do any thing contrary to it, and the Law upon which it is grounded. So that the utmost advantage the King can pretend to in this case, is no more than that of the <HI>Norman,</HI> who said he had gain'd his cause, because it depended upon a point that was to be decided by his Oath; that is to say, if he will betray the trust repos'd in him, and perjure himself, he may sometimes exempt a Villain from the punishment he de∣serves, and take the guilt upon himself. I say sometimes; for Appeals may be brought in some cases, and the Waterman who had bin par∣don'd by his Majesty in the year 1680, for a murder he had committed, was condemn'd and hang'd at the Assizes upon an Appeal. Nay, in ca∣ses of Treason, which some men think relate most particularly to the person of the King, he cannot always do it. <HI>Gaveston,</HI> the two <HI>Spen∣cers, Tresilian, Empson, Dudley,</HI> and others, have bin executed as Trai∣tors for things done by the King's command; and 'tis not doubted they would have bin sav'd, if the King's power had extended so far. I might add the cases of the Earls of <HI>Strafford</HI> and <HI>Danby;</HI> for tho the King sign d a Warrant for the execution of the first, no man doubts he would have sav'd him, if it had bin in his power. The other continues in prison notwithstanding his pardon; and for any thing I know he may continue where he is, or come out in a way that will not be to his satisfaction un∣less he be found innocent, or something fall out more to his advantage than his Majesty's approbation of what he has done. If therefore the King cannot interpose his authority to hinder the course of the Law in contests between private men, nor remit the debts adjudg'd to be due, or the damages given to the persons agriev'd, he can in his own person have no other power in things of this nature, than in some degree to mitigate the vindictive power of the Law; and this also is to be ex∣ercis'd no other way than as he is entrusted. But if he acts even in this capacity by a delegated power, and in few cases, he must act according to the ends for which he is so entrusted, as the same Law says, <HI>Cum mag∣natum &amp; sapientum consilio,</HI> and is not therein to pursue his own will and interests: If his Oath farther oblige him not to do it; and his Mini∣sters are liable to punishment, if they advise him otherwise: If in matters of Appeal he has no Power: and if his pardons have bin of no value, when contrary to his Oath he has abus'd that with which he
<PB N="405" REF="413"/>
is entrusted, to the patronizing of crimes, and exempting such delin∣quents from punishment, as could not be pardon'd without prejudice to the Publick: I may justly conclude, that the King, before whom every man is bound to appear, who dos perpetually and impartially distribute Justice to the Nation, is not the Man or Woman that wears the Crown; and that He or She cannot determin those matters, which by the Law are refer'd to the King. Whether therefore such matters are ordinary or extraordinary, the decision is and ought to be plac'd where there is most wisdom and stability, and where passion and private interest dos least prevail to the obstruction of Justice. This is the only way to ob∣viate that confusion and mischief, which our Author thinks it would in∣troduce. In cases of the first sort, this is done in <HI>England</HI> by Judges and Jurys: In the other by the Parliament, which being the Representative Body of the People, and the collected Wisdom of the Nation, is least sub∣ject to error, most exempted from passion, and most free from corruption, their own good both publick and private depending upon the rectitude of their Sanctions. They cannot do any thing that is ill without damage to themselves and their posterity; which being all that can be done by human understanding, our Lives, Libertys and Propertys are by our Laws di∣rected to depend upon them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLIII. Proclamations are not Laws.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author, according to his usual method and integrity, lays great weight upon Proclamations, as the significations of the King's pleasure, which in his opinion is our only Law. But neither Law nor Reason openly directing, nor by consequences insinuating, that such a Power should be put into an uncertain or suspected hand, we may safely deny them to be Laws, or in any sense to have the ef∣fect of Laws. Nay, they cannot be so much as Significations of his Will; for as he is King, he can have no Will but as the Law directs. If he depart from the Law, he is no longer King, and his Will is no∣thing to us. Proclamations, at most, are but temporary, by the ad∣vice of Council, in pursuance of the Law. If they be not so, the Sub∣ject is no way oblig'd to obey them, and the Counsellors are to be pu∣nish'd for them. These Laws are either immemorial Customs, or Sta∣tutes. The first have their beginning and continuance from the universal consent of the Nation. The latter receive their Authority and Force of Laws from Parliaments, as is frequently exprest in the Preambles. These are under God the best defence of our Lives, Libertys, and Estates: they proceed not from the blind, corrupt, and fluctuating humor of a man, but from the mature deliberation of the choicest Persons of the Nation, and such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s have the greatest interest in it. Our Ancestors have always rely'd up∣on these Laws; and 'tis to be hop'd we shall not be so abandon'd by God, so depriv'd of courage and common sense, to suffer our selves to be cheat∣ed of the Inheritance which they have so frequently, so bravely, and so constantly defended. Tho Experience has too well taught us, that Par∣liaments may have their failings, and that the Vices, which are indu∣striously spread among them, may be too prevalent; yet they are the best
<PB N="406" REF="414"/>
 helps we have, and we may much more reasonably depend upon them, than upon those who propagate that corruption among them for which only they can deserve to be suspected. We hope they will take care of our concernments, since they are as other men so soon as a Session is ended, and can do nothing to our prejudice that will not equally af∣fect them and their posterity; besides the guilt of betraying their Coun∣try, which can never be wash'd off. If some should prove false to their trust, 'tis probable that others would continue in their integrity: Or if the base arts, which are usually practis'd by those who endeavor to de∣lude, corrupt, enslave and ruin Nations, should happen to prevail upon the youngest and weakest, it may be reasonably hop'd, that the wisest will see the snares, and instruct their Companions to avoid them. But if all things were so put into the hands of one man, that his Proclamations were to be esteem'd Laws, the Nation would be expos'd to ruin, as soon as it should chance to fall into an ill hand. 'Tis in vain to say we have a good King, who will not make an ill use of his Power; for even the best are subject to be deceiv'd by Flatterers, and Crown'd Heads are almost ever encompast by them. The principal Art of a Courtier is to observe his Master's Passions, and to attack him on that side where he seems to be most weak. It would be a strange thing to find a man im∣pregnable in every part; and if he be not, 'tis impossible he should resist all the attempts that are made upon him. If his Judgment comes to be pre∣possest, he and all that depend on him are lost. Contradictions, tho ne∣ver so just, are then unsafe, and no man will venture upon them, but he who dares sacrifice himself for the publick good. The nature of man is frail, and stands in need of assistance. Vertuous actions that are pro∣fitable to the Commonwealth, ought to be made, as far as 'tis possible, safe, easy, and advantageous: and 'tis the utmost imprudence to tempt men to be enemys to the Publick, by suffering the most pernicious actions to be the means of obtaining Honor and Favor, whilst no man can serve his Country, but with the ruin of himself and his family.</P>
<P>However in this case the Question is not concerning a Person: the same Counsels are to be follow'd when <HI>Moses</HI> or <HI>Samuel</HI> is in the Throne, as if <HI>Caligula</HI> had invaded it. Laws ought to aim at perpetuity, but the Ver∣tues of a man dy with him, and very often before him. Those who have deserv'd the highest praises for wisdom and integrity, have frequently left the honors they enjoy'd to foolish and vicious Children. If Vertue may in any respect be said to outlive the Person, it can only be when good men frame such Laws and Constitutions as by favoring it preserve themselves. This has never bin done otherwise, than by balancing the Powers in such a manner, that the corruption which one or a few men might fall into, should not be suffer'd to spread the contagion to the ruin of the whole. The long continuance of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> his Laws is to be attributed to this: They restrain'd the lusts of Kings, and reduc'd those to order who ad∣ventur'd to transgress them: Whereas the whole fabrick must have fallen to the ground in a short time, if the first that had a fancy to be absolute, had bin able to effect his design. This has bin the fate of all Govern∣ments that were made to depend upon the vertue of a man, which never continues long in any family, and when that fails all is lost. The Nations therefore that are so happy to have good Kings, ought to make a right use of them, by establishing the good that may outlast their Lives. Those of them that are good, will readily join in this work, and take care that their Successors may be oblig'd in doing the like, to be equally beneficial
<PB N="407" REF="415"/>
to their own Familys, and the People they govern. If the Rulers of Nations be restrain'd, not only the People are by that means secur'd from the mischiefs of their vices and follys, but they themselves are preserv'd from the greatest temptations to ill, and the terrible effects of the vengeance that frequently ensues upon it. An unlimited Prince might be justly compar'd to a weak ship expos'd to a violent storm, with a vast Sail and no Rudder. We have an eminent example of this in the Book of <HI>Esther.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 3.</NOTE> A wicked Villain having fill'd the ears of a foolish King with false storys of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he issues out a Proclamation for their utter extirpation; and not long after being inform'd of the truth, he gave them leave by another Proclamation to kill whom they pleas'd, which they executed upon seventy thousand men. The Books of <HI>Ezra, Nehemiah</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> manifestly discover the like fluctuation in all the Counsels of <HI>Nabuchodonosor, Cyrus, Darius,</HI> and <HI>Artaxerxes.</HI> When good men had credit with them, they favor'd the <HI>Israelites;</HI> sent them back to their own Country; restor'd the sacred Vessels that had bin taken away; gave them all things necessary for the rebuilding of the City, and advanc'd the chief of them to the highest employments. But if they fell into ill hands, three just men must be thrown into the burning Furnace for refusing to wor∣ship an Idol; <HI>Daniel</HI> must be cast to the Lions; the holy City esteem'd re∣bellious, and those who endeavor'd to rebuild it, enemys to Kings. Such was the state of things, when their Proclamations pass'd for Laws, and numbers of flattering Slaves were ready to execute their Commands, with∣out examining whether they were just or unjust, good or bad. The life and death of the best men, together with the very being of Nations, was expos'd to chance, and they were either preserv'd or destroy'd accord∣ing to the humor of that man who spoke last to the King, or happen'd to have credit with him. If a frantick fancy come into the head of a drunken whore, <HI>Persepolis</HI> must be burnt, and the hand of <HI>Alexander</HI> is ready to execute her will. If a dancing wench please <HI>Herod,</HI> the most venerable of all human Heads must be offer'd in a dish for a sacrifice to the rage of her impure mother. The nature of man is so frail, that whereso∣ever the word of a single Person has had the force of a Law, the innume∣rable extravagances and mischiefs it has produc'd have bin so notorious, that all Nations who are not stupid, slavish and brutish, have always abomi∣nated it, and made it their principal care to find out remedys against it, by so dividing and balancing the Powers of their Government, that one or a few men might not be able to oppress and destroy those they ought to preserve and protect. This has always bin as grateful to the best and wisest Princes, as necessary to the weakest and worst, as I have prov'd already by the examples of <HI>Theopompus, Moses,</HI> and others. These con∣siderations have given beginning, growth and continuance to all the mix'd Governments that have bin in the World; and I may justly say there ne∣ver was a good one that was not mix'd. If other proofs of their rectitude were wanting, our Author's hatred would be enough to justify them. He is so bitter an enemy to Mankind, as to be displeas'd with nothing but that which tends to their good; and so perverse in his judgment, that we have reason to believe that to be good which he most abhors. One would think he had taken the model of the Government he proposes, from the mon∣strous Tyranny of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> an Island in the <HI>East-Indys,</HI> where the King knows no other Law than his own will. He kills, tears in pieces, empales, or throws to his Elephants whomsoever he pleases: No man has any thing that he can call his own: He seldom fails to destroy those who have
<PB N="408" REF="416"/>
 bin employ'd in his domestick Service, or publick Offices; and few ob∣tain the favor of being put to death and thrown to the Dogs without tor∣ments. His Subjects approach him no otherwise, than on their knees, lick∣ing the dust, and dare assume to themselves no other name than that of Dogs, or limbs of Dogs. This is a true pattern of <HI>Filmer</HI>'s <HI>Patriarchical Monarch.</HI> His Majesty, I suppose, is sufficiently exalted; for he dos what∣ever he pleases. The exercise of his power is as gentle as can reasonably be expected from one who has all by the unquestionable right of usurpa∣tion; and knows the People will no longer suffer him, and the Villains he hires to be the instruments of his Cruelty, than they can be kept in such ignorance, weakness and baseness, as neither to know how to provide for themselves, or dare to resist him. We ought to esteem our selves happy, if the like could be establish'd among us; and are much oblig'd to our Author for so kindly proposing an expedient that might terminate all our disputes. Let Proclamations obtain the power of Laws, and the business is done. They may be so ingeniously contriev'd, that the antient Laws, which we and our Fathers have highly valu'd, shall be abolish'd, or made a snare to all those that dare remember they are <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and are guilty of the unpardonable crime of loving their Country, or have the courage, conduct, and reputation requir'd to defend it. This is the sum of <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Philosophy, and this is the Legacy he has left to testify his affection to the Nation; which having for a long time lain unregarded, has bin lately brought into the light again, as an introduction of a Popish Successor, who is to be establish'd, as we ought to believe, for the security of the Protestant Religion, and our <HI>English</HI> Libertys. Both will undoubtedly flourish under a Prince who is made to believe the Kingdom is his Pa∣trimony; that his Will is a Law, and that he has a Power which none may resist. If any man doubt whether he will make a good use of it, he may only examin the Historys of what others in the same circum∣stances have done in all places where they have had power. The prin∣ciples of that Religion are fo full of meekness and charity; the Popes have always shew'd themselves so gentle towards those who would not submit to their Authority; the Jesuits, who may be accounted the Soul that give Life to the whole Body of that Faction, are so well natur'd, faithful and exact in their Morals, so full of innocence, justice and truth, that no violence is to be fear'd from such as are govern'd by them. The fatherly care shew'd to the Protestants of <HI>France,</HI> by the five last Kings of the House of <HI>Valois;</HI> the mercy of <HI>Philip</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain</HI> to his Pagan Subjects in the <HI>West-Indys,</HI> and the more hated Protestants in the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> the moderation of the Dukes of <HI>Savoy</HI> towards the <HI>Vaudois</HI> in the Marquisat of <HI>Saluzzo</HI> and the Vallys of <HI>Piedmont;</HI> the gentleness and faith of the two <HI>Marys</HI> Queens of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> the kindness of the Papists to the Protestants of <HI>Ireland</HI> in 1641; with what we have reason to believe they did and do still intend, if they can accomplish the ends o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Conspiracy: In a word, the sweetness and Apostolical meekness of the Inquisition, may sufficiently convince us that nothing is to be sear'd where that Principle reigns. We may suffer the word of such a Prince to be a Law, and the People to be made to believe it ought to be so▪ when he is expected. Tho we should wave the Bill of Exclu∣sion, and not only admit him to reign as other Kings have done, but re∣sign the whole Power into his hands, it would neither bring inconvenience or danger on the present King. He can with patience expect that na∣ture should take her course, and would neither anticipate nor secure his
<PB N="409" REF="417"/>
entrance into the possession of the Power, by taking one day from the Life of his Brother. Tho the Papists know that like a true Son of their Church, he would prefer the advancement of their Religion before all other considerations; and that one stab with a Dagger, or a dose of Poison, would put all under his feet, not one man would be found among them to give it. The Assassins were Mahometans, not Pupils of the honest Je∣suits, nor ever employ'd by them. These things being certain, all our con∣cernments would be secure, if instead of the foolish Statutes and antiqua∣ted Customs on which our Ancestors and we have hitherto doted, we may be troubled with no Law but the King's will, and a Proclamation may be taken for a sufficient declaretion of it. We shall by this means be deli∣ver'd from that <HI>Liberty with a mischief,</HI> in which our mistaken Nation seems so much to delight. This phrase is so new, and so peculiar to our Autor, that it deserves to be written upon his Tomb. We have heard of <HI>Tyranny with a mischief, Slavery and Bondage with a mischief;</HI> and they have bin denounc'd by God against wicked and perverse Nations, as mischiefs comprehending all that is most to be abhor'd and dreaded in the world. But <HI>Filmer</HI> informs us that Liberty, which all wise and good men have in all Ages esteem'd to be the most valuable and glorious privilege of Mankind, is <HI>a mischief.</HI> If he deserves credit, <HI>Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Sampson,</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> with others like them, were enemys to their Country, in de∣priving the People of the advantages they enjoy'd under the paternal care of <HI>Pharaoh, Adonibezek, Eglon, Jabin,</HI> and other Kings of the neighbor∣ing Nations, and restoring them to that <HI>Liberty with a mischief</HI> which he had promis'd to them. The <HI>Israelites</HI> were happy under the power of Ty∣rants, whose Proclamations were Laws; and they ought to have bin thankful to God for that condition, and not for the deliverances he wrought by the hands of his Servants. Subjection to the will of a man is happiness, Liberty is a <HI>mischief.</HI> But this is so abominably wicked and de∣testable, that it can deserve no answer.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLIV. A People that is not free cannot substitute Delegats.</HEAD>
<P>HOW full soever the Power of any Person or People may be, he or they are oblig'd to give only so much to their Delegats, as seems convenient to themselves, or conducing to the ends they desire to attain; but the Delegate can have none except what is confer'd upon him by his Principal. If therefore the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses sent by the People of <HI>England</HI> to serve in Parliament have a Power, it must be more perfectly and fully in those that send them. But (as was prov'd in the last Section) Proclamations, and other significations of the King's plea∣sure, are not Laws to us. They are to be regulated by the Law, not the Law by them. They are to be consider'd only so far as they are con∣formable to the Law from which they receive all the strength that is in them, and can confer none upon it. We know no Laws but our own Statutes, and those immemorial Customs establish'd by the consent of the Nation; which may be, and often are chang'd by us. The Legislative Power therefore that is exercis'd by the Parliament, cannot be confer'd by the Writ of Summons, but must be essentially and radically in the
<PB N="410" REF="418"/>
 People, from whom their Delegates and Representatives have all that they have. But, says our Author, <HI>They must only chuse, and trust those whom they chuse, to do what they list; and that is as much Liberty as many of us deserve for our irregular Elections of Burgesses.</HI> This is ingeniously con∣cluded: I take what Servant I please, and when I have taken him I must suffer him to do what he pleases. But from whence should this necessity arise? Why may not I take one to be my Groom, another to be my Cook, and keep them both to the Offices for which I took them? What Law dos herein restrain my Right? And if I am free in my private ca∣pacity to regulate my particular affairs according to my own discretion, and to allot to each Servant his proper work, why have not I with my Associates the Freemen of <HI>England</HI> the like liberty of directing and li∣miting the Powers of the Servants we employ in our publick Affairs? Our Author gives us reasons proportionable to his judgment: <HI>This were liberty with a mischief; and that of chusing only is as much as many of us deserve.</HI> I have already prov'd, that as far as our Historys reach, we have had no Princes or Magistrats, but such as we have made, and they have had no other Power than what we have confer'd upon them: They cannot be the judges of our Merit, who have no Power but what we gave them, thro an opinion they did or might deserve it: They may distribute in parcels to particulars that with which they are entrusted in the gross. But 'tis impos∣sible the Publick should depend absolutely upon those who are nothing a∣bove other men, except what they are made to be, for, and by the Pub∣lick. The restrictions therefore of the Peoples Liberty must be from them∣selves, or there can be none.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, I believe, that the Powers of every County, City and Borough of <HI>England,</HI> are regulated by the general Law to which they have all consented, and by which they are all made Members of one Political Body. This obliges them to proceed with their Delegats in a manner different from that which is us'd in the United Netherlands, or in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> Amongst these every Province, City or Canton, mak∣ing a distinct Body independent from any other, and exercising the So∣vereign Power within it self, looks upon the rest only as Allies, to whom they are bound only by such Acts as they themselves have made; and when any new thing not comprehended in them happens to arise, they oblige their Delegats to give them an account of it, and retain the power of determining those matters in themselves. 'Tis not so amongst us: Every County dos not make a distinct Body, having in it self a Sovereign Power, but is a Member of that Great Body which compre∣hends the whole Nation. 'Tis not therefore for <HI>Kent</HI> or <HI>Sussex, Lewis</HI> or <HI>Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stone,</HI> but for the whole Nation, that the Members chosen in those places are sent to serve in Parliament: and tho it be fit for them as Friends and Neighbors (so far as may be) to hearken to the Opinions of the Electors for the Information of their Judgments, and to the end that what they shall say may be of more weight, when every one is known not to speak his own thoughts only, but those of a great number of men; yet they are not strictly and properly oblig'd to give account of their Actions to any, unless the whole Body of the Nation for which they serve, and who are equally concern'd in their Resolutions, could be assembled. This being impracticable, the only punishment to which they are subject if they betray their Trust, is scorn, infamy, hatred, and an assurance of being rejected, when they shall again seek the same Honor. And tho this may seem a small matter to those who fear to do ill
<PB N="411" REF="419"/>
only from a sense of the pains inflicted; yet it is very terrible to men of ingenuous spirits, as they are suppos'd to be who are accounted fit to be entrusted with so great Powers. But why it should be call'd <HI>Liberty with a mischief</HI> if it were otherwise; or how the liberty of particular Societys would be greater, if they might do what they pleas'd, than whilst they send others to act for them, such wise men only as <HI>Filmer</HI> can tell us. For as no man, or number of men, can give a Power which he or they have not, the <HI>Achaians, Etolians, Latins, Samnites</HI> and <HI>Tuscans,</HI> who transacted all things relating to their Associations by Delegates; and the <HI>Athenians, Carthaginians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> who kept the power of the State in themselves, were all equally free. And in our days the Uni∣ted Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the <HI>Switzers</HI> and <HI>Grisons,</HI> who are of the first sort, and the <HI>Venetians, Genoeses,</HI> and <HI>Luccheses,</HI> who are of the other, are so also. All men that have any degree of common sense, plainly see, that the Liberty of those who act in their own persons, and of those who send Delegates, is perfectly the same, and the exercise is, and can only be chang'd by their consent.</P>
<P>But whatever the Law or Custom of <HI>England</HI> be in this point, it can∣not concern our question. The general proposition concerning a Patriar∣chical Power cannot be prov'd by a single example. If there be a gene∣ral Power every where, forbidding Nations to give instructions to their Delegates, they can do it no where. If there be no such thing, every People may do it, unless they have depriv'd themselves of their right, all being born under the same condition. 'Tis to no purpose to say that the Nations before mention'd had not Kings, and therefore might act as they did. For if the general Thesis be true, they must have Kings; and if it be not, none are oblig'd to have them, unless they think fit, and the Kings they make are their Creatures. But many of these Nati∣ons had either Kings, or other Magistrats in power like to them. The Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> had Dukes, Earls, or Marquesses: <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> have Dukes. If any on account of the narrowness of their Territorys have abstain'd from the Name, it dos not alter the case; for our dispute is not concerning the Name, but the Right. If that one Man, who is in the principal Magistracy of every Nation, must be re∣puted the Father of that People, and has a Power which may not be li∣mited by any Law, it imports not what he is call'd. But if in small Territorys he may be limited by Laws, he may be so also in the greatest. The least of men is a man as well as a Giant: And those in the <HI>West-Indys</HI> who have not above twenty or thirty Subjects able to bear Arms, are Kings as well as <HI>Xerxes.</HI> Every Nation may divide it self into small parcels as some have done, by the same Law they have restrain'd or abo∣lish'd their Kings, join'd to one another, or taken their hazard of sub∣sisting by themselves; acted by delegation, or retaining the Power in their own persons; given finite or indefinite Powers; reserv'd to them∣selves a power of punishing those who should depart from their duty, or refer'd it to their General Assemblys. And that Liberty, for which we contend as the Gift of God and Nature, remains equally to all.</P>
<P>If men who delight in cavilling should say, that great Kingdoms are not to be regulated by the Examples of small States, I desire to know when it was, that God ordain'd great Nations should be Slaves, and de∣priv'd of all right to dispose matters relating to their Government; whilst he left to such as had, or should divide themselves into small parcels, a right of making such Constitutions as were most convenient for them.
<PB N="412" REF="420"/>
 When this is resolv'd, we ought to be inform'd, what extent of Terri∣tory is requir'd to deserve the name of a great Kingdom. <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> are esteem'd great, and yet the Deputys or <HI>Procuradores</HI> of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vida de Car∣los 5<SUP>0</SUP> de San∣doval.</NOTE>several parts of <HI>Castille</HI> did in the <HI>Cortez</HI> held at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth's reign, excuse themselves from giving the supplys he desir'd, because they had receiv'd no orders in that particular from the Towns that sent them; and afterwards receiving express orders not to do it, they gave his Majesty a flat denial. The like was frequently done du∣ring the reigns of that great Prince, and of his Son <HI>Philip</HI> the second. And generally those <HI>Procuradores</HI> never granted any thing of importance to either of them, without particular Orders from their Principals. The same way was taken in <HI>France,</HI> as long as there were any General Assem∣blys of Estates; and if it dos not still continue, 'tis because there are none. For no man who understood the Affairs of that Kingdom, did ever deny, that the Deputys were oblig'd to follow the Orders of those who sent them. And perhaps, if men would examin by what means they came to be abolish'd, they might find, that the Cardinals <HI>de Riche∣lieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarin,</HI> with other Ministers who have accomplish'd that work, were acted by some other principle than that of Justice, or the establishment of the Laws of God and Nature. In the General Assem∣bly of Estates held at <HI>Blois</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Bodin</HI> then <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Thuan.</NOTE>Deputy for the third Estate of <HI>Vermandois,</HI> by their particular Order, propos'd so many things as took up a great part of their time. Other Deputys alledg'd no other reason for many things said and done by them, highly contrary to the King's will, than that they were commanded so to do by their Superiors. These General Assemblys being laid aside, the same custom is still us'd in the lesser Assemblys of Estates in <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Britany.</HI> The Deputys cannot without the infamy of betraying their Trust, and fear of punishment, recede from the Orders given by their Principals; and yet we do not find that <HI>Liberty with a mischief</HI> is much more predominant in <HI>France</HI> than amongst us. The same method is every day practis'd in the Diets of <HI>Germany.</HI> The Princes and great Lords, who have their places in their own right, may do what they please; but the Deputys of the Citys must follow such Orders as they receive. The Historys of <HI>Denmark, Sweden, Poland</HI> and <HI>Bohemia,</HI> testify the same thing: and if this <HI>Liberty with a mischief</HI> dos not still continue intire in all those places, it has bin diminish'd by such means as sute better with the manners of Pirats, than the Laws of God and Nature. If <HI>England</HI> therefore dos not still enjoy the same, we must have bin depriv'd of it either by such unjustifiable means, or by our own consent. But thanks be to God, we know no People who have a better right to Liberty, or have better defended it than our own Nation. And if we do not dege∣nerate from the Vertue of our Ancestors, we may hope to transmit it intire to our Posterity. We always may, and often do give Instructions to our Delegates; but the less we fetter them, the more we manifest our own Rights: for those who have only a limited Power, must limit that which they give; but they that can give an unlimited Power must necessarily have it in themselves. The great Treasurer <HI>Burleigh</HI> said, the Parliament could do any thing but turn a Man into a Woman. Sir <HI>Thomas Moor,</HI> when <HI>Rich</HI> Solicitor to K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th</HI> ask'd him, if the Parliament might not make <HI>R. Rich</HI> King, said, that was <HI>casus levis,</HI> taking it for granted that they might make or unmake whom they pleas'd. The first part of this, which includes the other, is asserted by the Statute of the
<PB N="413" REF="421"/>
13<HI>th</HI> of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> denouncing the most grievous punishments against all such as should dare to contradict it. But if it be in the Parliament, it must be in those who give to Parliament-men the powers by which they act; for before they are chosen they have none, and can never have any if those that send them had it not in themselves. They cannot receive it from the Magistrate, for that power which he has is deriv'd from the same spring. The power of making and unmaking him cannot be from himself; for he that is not, can do nothing, and when he is made can have no other power than is confer'd upon him by those that make him. Besides, he who departs from his duty desires to avoid the punishment, the power therefore of punishing him is not from himself. It cannot be from the House of Peers as it is constituted, for they act for themselves, and are chosen by Kings: and 'tis absurd to think that Kings, who gene∣rally abhor all restriction of their Power, should give that to others by which they might be unmade. If one or more Princes relying upon their own Vertue and Resolutions to do good, had given such a power against themselves, as <HI>Trajan</HI> did, when he commanded the Prefect to use the Sword for him if he govern'd well, and against him if he govern'd ill, it would soon have bin rescinded by their Successors. If our <HI>Edward</HI> the first had made such a Law, his leud Son would have abolish'd it, before he would have suffer'd himself to be imprison'd and depos'd by it. He would never have acknowledg'd his unworthiness to reign, if he had bin ty'd to no other Law than his own will, for he could not transgress that; nor have own'd the mercy of the Parliament in sparing his Life, if they had acted only by a power which he had confer'd upon them. This Power must therefore be in those who act by a delegated Power, and none can give it to their Delegates but they who have it in themselves. The most certain testimony that can be given of their unlimited Power is, that they rely upon the Wisdom and Fidelity of their Deputys, so as to lay no restrictions upon them: they may do what they please, if they take care <HI>ne quid detrimenti Respublica accipiat, that the Commonwealth receives no detriment.</HI> This is a Commission fit to be granted by wise and good men, to those they chuse thro an opinion that they are so also, and that they cannot bring any prejudice upon the Nation, that will not fall upon themselves and their posterity. This is also fit to be receiv'd by those, who seeking nothing but that which is just in it self, and profitable to their Country, cannot foresee what will be propos'd when they are all met together; much less resolve how to vote till they hear the reasons on both sides. The Electors must necessarily be in the same ignorance; and that Law which should oblige them to give particular Orders to their Knights and Burgesses in relation to every Vote, would make the decision of the most important Affairs to depend upon the judgment of those who know nothing of the matters in question, and by that means cast the Nation into the utmost danger of the most inextricable confusion. This can never be the intention of that Law which is <HI>Sanctio recta,</HI> and seeks only the good of those that live under it. The foresight therefore of such a mis∣chief can never impair the Libertys of the Nation, but establish them.</P>

<HEAD> SECT. XLV. The Legislative Power is always Arbitrary, and not to be trusted in the hands of any who are not bound to obey the Laws they make.</HEAD>
<P>IF it be objected that I am a defender of Arbitrary Powers, I con∣fess I cannot comprehend how any Society can be establish'd or sub∣sist without them; for the establishment of Government is an arbitrary Act, wholly depending upon the will of man. The particular Forms and Constitutions, the whole Series of the Magistracy, together with the mea∣sure of Power given to every one, and the Rules by which they are to exercise their Charge, are so also. <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> which comprehends our antient Laws, and all the subsequent Statutes, were not sent from Heaven, but made according to the will of men. If no men could have a Power of making Laws, none could ever have bin made; for all that are or have bin in the World, except those given by God to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> were made by them; that is, they have exercis'd an Arbitrary Power in making that to be Law which was not, or annulling that which was. The various Laws and Governments, that are or have bin in several Ages and Places, are the product of various opinions in those who had the power of making them. This must necessarily be, unless a general Rule be set to all; for the Judgments of men will vary if they are left to their li∣berty, and the variety that is found among them, shews they are subject to no Rule but that of their own Reason, by which they see what is fit to be embrac'd or avoided, according to the several circumstances under which they live. The Authority that judges of these circumstances is ar∣bitrary, and the Legislators shew themselves to be more or less wise and good, as they do rightly or not rightly exercise this Power. The diffe∣rence therefore between good and ill Governments is not, that those of one sort have an Arbitrary Power which the others have not, for they all have it; but that those which are well constituted, place this Power so as it may be beneficial to the People, and set such Rules as are hardly to be transgrest; whilst those of the other sort fail in one or both these points. Some also thro want of courage, fortune, or strength, may have bin op∣prest by the violence of Strangers, or suffer'd a corrupt Party to rise up within themselves, and by force or fraud to usurp a Power of imposing what they pleas'd. Others being sottish, cowardly and base, have so far err'd in the Foundations, as to give up themselves to the will of one or few men, who turning all to their own profit or pleasure, have bin just in nothing but in using such a People like beasts. Some have plac'd weak defences against the lusts of those they have advanc'd to the highest places, and given them opportunitys of arrogating more power to themselves than the Law allows. Where any of these errors are committed, the Go∣vernment may be easy for a while, or at least tolerable, whilst it conti∣nues uncorrupted, but it cannot be lasting. When the Law may be easi∣ly or safely overthrown, it will be attempted. Whatever vertue may be in the first Magistrats, many years will not pass before they come to be corrupted; and their Successors deflecting from their integrity, will seize upon the ill-guarded prey. They will then not only govern by will, but by that irregular will, which turns the Law, that was made for the publick
<PB N="415" REF="423"/>
good, to the private advantage of one or few men. 'Tis not my inten∣tion to enumerate the several ways that have bin taken to effect this; or to shew what Governments have deflected from the right, and how far. But I think I may justly say, that an Arbitrary Power was never well plac'd in any men and their Successors, who were not oblig'd to obey the Laws they should make. This was well understood by our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ancestors: They made Laws in their Assemblys and Councils of the Na∣tion; but all those who propos'd or assented to those Laws, as soon as the Assembly was dissolv'd, were comprehended under the power of them as well as other men. They could do nothing to the prejudice of the Na∣tion, that would not be as hurtful to those who were present and their posterity, as to those who by many accidents might be absent. The <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> enter'd into, and continu'd in the same path. Our Parliaments at this day are in the same condition. They may make prejudicial Wars, ignominious Treatys, and unjust Laws: yet when the Session is ended, they must bear the burden as much as others; and when they dy, <HI>the teeth of their Children will be set an edg with the sour Grapes they have eaten.</HI> But 'tis hard to delude or corrupt so many: Men do not in matters of the highest importance yield to slight temptations. No man serves the Devil for nothing: Small wages will not content those who expose them∣selves to perpetual infamy, and the hatred of a Nation for betraying their Country. Our Kings had not wherewithal to corrupt many till these last twenty years, and the treachery of a few was not enough to pass a Law. The union of many was not easily wrought, and there was no∣thing to tempt them to endeavour it; for they could make little ad∣vantage during the Session, and were to be lost in the mass of the Peo∣ple, and prejudic'd by their own Laws, as soon as it was ended. They could not in a short time reconcile their various interests or passions, so as to combine together against the Publick; and the former Kings never went about it. We are beholden to <HI>H-de, Cl-ff-rd</HI> and <HI>D-nby,</HI> for all that has bin done of that kind. They found a Parliament full of leud young men chosen by a furious People in spite to the Puritans, whose severity had distasted them. The weakest of all Ministers had wit e∣nough to understand that such as these might be easily deluded, cor∣rupted, or brib'd. Some were fond of their Seats in Parliament, and delighted to domineer over their Neighbors by continuing in them: Others prefer'd the cajolerys of the Court before the honor of perform∣ing their duty to the Country that employ'd them. Some sought to re∣lieve their ruin'd Fortunes, and were most forward to give the King a vast Revenue, that from thence they might receive Pensions: others were glad of a temporary Protection against their Creditors. Many knew not what they did when they annul'd the Triennial Act, voted the Mili∣tia to be in the King, gave him the Excise, Customs and Chimny-mony, made the Act for Corporations, by which the greatest part of the Na∣tion was brought under the power of the worst men in it; drunk or so∣ber pass'd the Five-mile Act, and that for Uniformity in the Church. This embolden'd the Court to think of making Parliaments to be the instru∣ments of our Slavery, which had in all Ages past bin the firmest pillars of our Liberty. There might have bin perhaps a possibility of pre∣venting this pernicious mischief in the Constitution of our Government. But our brave Antestors could never think their Posterity would dege∣nerate into such baseness to sell themselves and their Country: yet how great soever the danger may be, 'tis less than to put all into the hands of
<PB N="416" REF="424"/>
 one Man and his Ministers: the hazard of being ruin'd by those who must perish with us, is not so much to be fear'd, as by one who may enrich and strengthen himself by our destruction. 'Tis better to depend upon those who are under a possibility of being again corrupted, than upon one who applys himself to corrupt them, because he cannot otherwise ac∣complish his designs. It were to be wish'd that our security were more certain; but this being, under God, the best Anchor we have, it deserves to be preserv'd with all care, till one of a more unquestionable strength be fram'd by the consent of the Nation.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLVI. The coercive power of the Law proceeds from the Authority of Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING prov'd that Proclamations are not Laws, and that the Legislative Power, which is arbitrary, is trusted only in the hands of those who are bound to obey the Laws that are made, 'tis not hard to discover what it is that gives the power of Law to the Sanctions under which we live. Our Author tells us, That <HI>all Statutes or Laws are made properly by the King alone, at the Rogation of the People, as his Majesty King</HI> James <HI>of happy Memory affirms in his true Law of Free Monarchy; and as</HI> Hooker <HI>teaches us, That Laws do not take their constraining power from the quality of such as devise them, but from the power that gives them the strength of Law.</HI> But if the Rogation of the People be necessary, that cannot be a Law which proceeds not from their Rogation: the power therefore is not alone in the King; for a most important part is confest to be in the People. And as none could be in them, if our Author's Propo∣sition, or the Principles upon which it is grounded, were true, the acknow∣ledgment of such a part to be in the People shews them to be false. For if the King had all in himself, none could participate with him: if any do participate, he has not all; and 'tis from that Law by which they do participate, that we are to know what part is left to him. The preambles of most Acts of Parliament manifest this by the words, <HI>Be it enacted by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament assembled, and by Authority of the same.</HI> But <HI>King</HI> James, says <HI>Filmer, in his Law of Free Monarchy affirms the contrary;</HI> and it may be so, yet that is nothing to us. No man doubts that he desir'd it might be so in <HI>England:</HI> but it dos not from thence appear that it is so. The Law of a Free Monarchy is nothing to us; for that Monarchy is not free which is regulated by a Law not to be broken without the guilt of Perjury, as he himself <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Speech in Star-Chamber, <HI>1616.</HI></NOTE>confest in relation to ours. As to the words cited from <HI>Hooker,</HI> I can find no hurt in them. To draw up the form of a good Law, is a matter of invention and jugdment, but it receives the force of a Law from the Power that enacts it. We have no other reason for the payment of Excise or Customs, than that the Parliament has granted those Revenues to the King to defray the publick Charges. Whatever therefore King <HI>James</HI> was pleas'd to say in his Books, or in those written for him, we do not so much as know that the killing of a King is Treason, or to be punish'd with death, otherwise than as it is enacted by Parliament; and it was not always so: for in the time

Aethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣stani, fol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE><HI>Ethelstan,</HI> the Estimates of Lives were agreed in Parliament, and that of a King valu'd at thirty thousand <HI>Thrymsae.</HI> And if that Law had not bin alter'd by the Parliament, it must have bin in force at this day. It had bin in vain for a King to say he would have it otherwise; for he is not created to make Laws, but to govern according to such as are made, and sworn to assent to <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quas vulgus elegerit.</NOTE><HI>such as shall be propos'd.</HI> He who thinks the Crown not worth accepting on these conditions, may refuse it. The words <HI>Le Roy le veut,</HI> are only a pattern of the <HI>French</HI> fashions, upon which some Kings have laid gress stress, and would no doubt have bin glad to intro∣duce <HI>Car tel est notre plaisir;</HI> but that may prove a difficult matter. Nay in <HI>France</HI> it self, where that Stile, and all the ranting expressions that please the vainest of men are in mode, no Edict has the power of a Law, till it be register'd in Parliament. This is not a mere ceremony, as some pre∣tend, but all that is essential to a Law. Nothing has bin more common than for those Parliaments to refuse Edicts sent to them by the King. When <HI>John Chastel</HI> had, at the instigation of the Jesuits, stab'd <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth in the Mouth, and that Order had design'd or executed many other execrable crimes, they were banish'd out of the Kingdom by an Arrest of the Parliament of <HI>Paris.</HI> Some other Parliaments register'd the same; but those of <HI>Tholouse</HI> and <HI>Bordeaux</HI> absolutely refus'd, and notwith∣standing all the King could do, the Jesuits continu'd at <HI>Tournon</HI> and many other places within their Precincts, till the Arrest was revok'd. These proceedings are so displeasing to the Court, that the most violent ways have bin often us'd to abolish them. About the year 1650, <HI>Seguier</HI> then Chan∣cellor <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mem. de L. R. F.</NOTE>of <HI>France</HI> was sent with a great number of Soldiers to oblige the Par∣liament of <HI>Paris</HI> to pass some Edicts upon which they had hesitated; but he was so far from accomplishing his design, that the People rose against him, and he thought himself happy that he escap'd with his Life. If the Parliaments do not in all parts of the Kingdom continue in the Liberty of approving or rejecting all Edicts, the Law is not alter'd, but opprest by the violence of the Sword: And the Prince of <HI>Condé,</HI> who was princi∣pally employ'd to do that work, may, I suppose, have had leisure to reflect on those Actions, and cannot but find reason to conclude, that his excel∣lent valor and conduct was us'd in a most noble Exploit, equally benefi∣cial to his Country and himself. However, those who are skill'd in the Laws of that Nation do still affirm, that all publick Acts which are not du∣ly examin'd and register'd, are void in themselves, and can be of no force longer than the miserable People lies under the violence of Oppression; which is all that could reasonably be said, if a Pirat had the same power over them. But whether the <HI>French</HI> have willingly offer'd their ears to be bor'd, or have bin subdu'd by force, it concerns us not. Our Libertys depend not upon their will, vertue, or fortune: how wretched and shame∣ful soever their Slavery may be, the evil is only to themselves. We are to consider no human Laws but our own; and if we have the spirit of our Ancestors we shall maintain them, and dy as free as they left us. <HI>Le Roy le veut,</HI> tho written in great Letters, or pronounc'd in the most tragical manner, can signify no more than that the King in performance of his Oath dos assent to such Laws as the Lords and Commons have agreed. Without prejudice to themselves and their Libertys, a People may suffer the King to advise with his Council upon what they propose.
<PB N="418" REF="426"/>
 Two eyes see more than one, and human judgment is subject to errors. Tho the Parliament consists of the most eminent men of the Nation, yet when they intend good, they may be mistaken. They may safely put a check upon themselves, that they may farther consider the most impor∣tant matters, and correct the errors that may have bin committed, if the King's Council do discover them: but he can speak only by the advice of his Council; and every man of them is with his head to answer for the ad∣vice he gives. If the Parliament has not bin satisfy'd with the reasons given against any Law that they offer'd, it has frequently pass'd; and if they have bin satisfy'd, 'twas not the King, but they that laid it aside. He that is of another opinion, may try whether <HI>Le Roy le veut</HI> can give the force of a Law to any thing conceiv'd by the King, his Council, or any other than the Parliament. But if no wise man will affirm that he can do it, or deny that by his Oath he is oblig'd to assent to those that come from them, he can neither have the Legislative power in himself, nor any other part in it than what is formal, and necessarily to be perform'd by him, as the Law prescribes.</P>
<P>I know not what our Author means by saying, <HI>Le Roy le veut is the in∣terpretative phrase pronounc'd at the passing of every Act of Parliament:</HI> For if there be difficulty in any of them, those words do no way remove it. But the following part of the paragraph better deserves to be observ'd. <HI>It was,</HI> says he, <HI>the antient custom for a long time until the days of</HI> Henry <HI>the Fifth, for the Kings when any Bill was brought to them that had pass'd both Houses, to take and pick out what they lik'd not; and so much as they chose was enacted as a Law: But the custom of the latter Kings has bin so gracious, as to allow al∣ways of the intire Bill as it pass'd both Houses.</HI> He judiciously observes when our Kings began to be gracious, and we to be free. That King (except∣ing the persecution for Religion in his time, which is rather to be imputed to the ignorance of that Age, than to any evil in his own nature) govern'd well; and as all Princes who have bin vertuous and brave have always de∣sir'd to preserve their Subjects Liberty, which they knew to be the mo∣ther and nurse of their Valor, fitting them for great and generous Enter∣prizes, his care was to please them, and to raise their Spirits. But about the same time, those detestable Arts by which the mix'd Monarchys in this part of the world have bin every where terribly shaken, and in many places totally overthrown, began to be practis'd. <HI>Charles</HI> the Seventh of <HI>France,</HI> under pretence of carrying on a War against him and his Son, took upon him to raise Mony by his own Authority, and we know how well that method has bin pursu'd. The mischievous sagacity of his Son <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th,</HI> which is now call'd <HI>King-Craft,</HI> was wholly exerted in the sub∣version of the Laws of <HI>France,</HI> and the Nobility that supported them. His Successors, except only <HI>Lewis</HI> the 12<HI>th,</HI> follow'd his example; and in other Nations, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Arragon, James</HI> the Third of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh of <HI>England,</HI> were thought to imitate him the most. Tho we have little reason to commend all the Princes that preceded <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth; yet I am inclin'd to date the general impairing of our Government from the death of that King, and his valiant Brothers. His weak Son became a prey to a furious <HI>French</HI> Woman, who brought the Maxims of her own Country into ours, and advano'd the worst of Villains to govern according to them. These measures were pursu'd by <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th,</HI> whose wants contracted by prodigality and debauchery, were to be supply'd by fraud and rapine. The ambition, cruelty and perfidiousness of <HI>Richard</HI> the 3<HI>d;</HI> the covetousness and malicious subtilty of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th;</HI> the violent lust, rage and pride of
<PB N="419" REF="427"/>
<HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th,</HI> and the bigotted fury of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> instigated by the craft and malice of <HI>Spain,</HI> persuaded me to believe that the <HI>English</HI> Liberty did not re∣ceive birth or growth from the favor and goodness of their gracious Prin∣ces. But it seems all this is mistaken; <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> was wise, valiant, and no way guided by his Wife; <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth continent, sober, and contented with what the Nation gave him; <HI>Richard</HI> the third mild, gen∣tle and faithful; <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th</HI> sincere, and satisfy'd with his own; <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th</HI> humble, temperate and just; and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> a friend to our Country and Religion. No less praises sure can be due to those who were so gracious to recede from their own right of picking what they pleas'd out of our Laws, and to leave them intirely to us as they pass'd both Hou∣ses. We are beholden to our Author for the discovery of these myste∣rys: but tho he seems to have taken an Oath like that of the Gypsys when they enter into that vertuous Society, never to speak one word of truth, he is not so subtle in concealing his Lies. All Kings were trusted with the publication of the Laws, but all Kings did not falsify them. Such as were not wicked and vicious, or so weak as to be made subservi∣ent to the malice of their Ministers and Flatterers, could never be drawn into the guilt of so infamous a cheat, directly contrary to the Oath of their Coronation. They swear to pass such <HI>Laws</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quas vulgus elegerit.</NOTE><HI>as the People chuse;</HI> but if we will believe our Author, they might have pick'd out whatever they pleas'd, and falsly impos'd upon the Nation, as a Law made by the Lords and Commons, that which they had model'd according to their own will, and made to be different from, or contrary to the intention of the Parliament. The King's part in this fraud (of which he boasts) was little more than might have bin done by the Speaker or his Clerks. They might have falsify'd an Act as well as the King, tho they could not so well preserve themselves from punishment. 'Tis no wonder if for a while no stop was put to such an abominable Custom. 'Twas hard to think a King would be guilty of a fraud, that were infamous in a Slave: But that prov'd to be a small security, when the worst of Slaves came to govern them. Nevertheless 'tis probable they proceeded cautiously: the first alterations were perhaps innocent, or, it may be, for the best. But when they had once found out the way, they stuck at nothing that seem'd for their purpose. This was like the plague of Leprosy, that could not be cur'd; the house infected was to be demolish'd; the poisonous plant must be torn up by the root; the trust that had bin broken was to be abolish'd; they who had perverted or frustrated the Law, were no longer to be suffer'd to make the least alteration; and that brave Prince readily join'd with his People to extinguish the mischievous abuse that had bin introduc'd by some of his worthless Predecessors. The worst and basest of them had continual disputes with their Parliaments, and thought that whatever they could detract from the Liberty of the Nation, would serve to advance their Prerogative. They delighted in frauds, and would have no other Ministers but such as would be the instruments of them. Since their Word could not be made to pass for a Law, they indeavor'd to impose their own or their Servants inventions as Acts of Parliament, upon the de∣luded people, and to make the best of them subservient to their corrupt Ends and pernicious Counsels. This, if it had continu'd, might have overthrown all our Rights, and depriv'd us of all that men can call good in the world. But the Providence of God furnish'd our Ancestors with an
<PB N="420" REF="428"/>
 opportunity of providing against so great, so universal a mischief. They had a wise and valiant Prince, who scorn'd to encroach upon the Libertys of his Subjects, and abhor'd the detestable Arts by which they had bin impair'd. He esteem'd their courage, strength, and love, to be his great∣est Advantage, Riches and Glory. He aim'd at the conquest of <HI>France,</HI> which was only to be effected by the bravery of a free and well satisfy'd People. Slaves will always be cowards, and enemys to their Master: By bringing his Subjects into that condition, he must infallibly have ruin'd his own designs, and made them unfit to fight either for him or themselves. He desir'd not only that his People should be free during his time, but that his Successors should not be able by oblique and fraudulent ways to enslave them. If it be a reproach to us that Women have reign'd over us, 'tis much more to the Princes that succeeded our <HI>Henry,</HI> that none of them did so much imitate him in his Government as Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> She did not go about to mangle Acts of Parliament, and to pick out what might serve her turn, but frequently pass'd forty of fifty in a Session, without reading one of them. She knew that she did not reign for her self, but for her People; that what was good for them, was either good for her, or that her good ought not to come into competition with that of the whole Nation; and that she was by Oath oblig'd to pass such Laws as were presented to her on their behalf. This not only shews that there is no such thing as a Legislative Power plac'd in Kings by the Laws of God and Nature, but that Nations have it in themselves. It was not by Law nor by Right, but by Usurpation, Fraud and Perjury, that some Kings took upon them to pick what they pleas'd out of the publick Acts. <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth did not grant us the right of making our own Laws; but with his approbation we abolish'd a detestable abuse that might have prov'd fatal to us. And if we examin our History we shall find, that every good and generous Prince has sought to establish our Libertys, as much as the most base and wicked to infringe them. *</P>

<HEAD>The COPY of a PAPER Deliver'd to the SHERIFFS, Upon the Scaffold on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> On Friday <HI>Decemb.</HI> 7. 1683. BY Algernon Sidney <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Immediately before his Death. Men, Brethren, and Fathers; Friends, Countrymen, and Strangers:</HEAD>
<P>IT May be expected that I should now say some great matters unto you; but the Rigor of the Season, and the Infirmitys of my Age, increas'd by a close Imprisonment of above five Months, do not permit me.</P>
<P>Moreover, we live in an Age that makes Truth pass for Treason: I dare not say any thing contrary unto it, and the Ears of those that are about me will probably be found too tender to hear it. My Trial and Condemnation doth sufficiently evidence this.</P>
<P><HI>West, Rumsey,</HI> and <HI>Keyling,</HI> who were brought to prove the Plot, said no more of me, than that they knew me not; and some others equally un∣known to me, had us'd my Name, and that of some others, to give a little Reputation to their Designs. The Lord <HI>Howard</HI> is too infamous by his Life, and the many Perjurys not to be deny'd, or rather sworn by him∣self,
<PB N="422" REF="430"/>
to deserve mention; and being a single Witness would be of no value, tho he had been of unblemish'd Credit, or had not seen and confess'd that the Crimes committed by him would be pardon'd only for committing more; and even the Pardon promis'd could not be obtain'd till the drudgery of Swearing was over.</P>
<P>This being laid aside, the whole matter is reduc'd to the Papers said to be found in my Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t by the King's Officers, without any other Proof of their being written by me, than what is taken from suppositions upon the similitude of an Hand that is easily counterfeited, and which hath been lately declar'd in the Lady <HI>Car</HI>'s Case to be no lawful Evidence in Criminal Causes.</P>
<P>But if I had been seen to write them, the matter would not be much alter'd. They plainly appear to relate to a large Treatise written long since in Answer to <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Book, which by all Intelligent Men is thought to be grounded upon wicked Principles, equally pernicious to Magi∣strates and People.</P>
<P>If he might publish to the World his Opinion, That all Men are born under a necessity deriv'd from the Laws of God and Nature, to submit to an Absolute Kingly Government, which could be restrain'd by no Law, or Oath; and that he that has the Power, whether he came to it by Creation, Election, Inheritance, Usurpation, or any other way, had the Right; and none must oppose his Will, but the Per∣sons and Estates of his Subjects must be indispensably subject unto it; I know not why I might not have publish'd my Opinion to the contrary, without the breach of any Law I have yet known.</P>
<P>I might as freely as he, publickly have declar'd my Thought, and the reasons upon which they were grounded, and I persuaded to believe, That God had left Nations to the Liberty of setting up such Govern∣ments as best pleas'd themselves.</P>
<P>That Magistrates were set up for the good of Nations, not Nations for the honour or glory of Magistrates.</P>
<P>That the Right and Power of Magistrates in every Country, was that which the Laws of that Country made it to be.</P>
<P>That those Laws were to be observ'd, and the Oaths taken by them, having the force of a Contract between Magistrate and People, could not be violated without danger of dissolving the whole Fabrick.</P>
<P>That Usurpation could give no Right, and the most dangerous of all Enemys to Kings were they, who raising their Power to an exorbitant height, allow'd to Usurpers all the Rights belonging unto it.</P>
<P>That such Usurpations being seldom compass'd without the Slaughter of the Reigning Person, or Family, the worst of all Villanys was there∣by rewarded with the most glorious Privileges.</P>
<P>That if such Doctrines were receiv'd, they would stir up Men to the Destruct on of Princes with more Violence than all the Passions that have hitherto rag'd in the Hearts of the most Unruly.</P>
<P>That none could be safe, if such a Reward were propos'd to any that could destro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them.</P>
<P>That few would be so gentle as to spare even the Best, if by their destruction a wild Usurper could become God's Anointed, and by the most execrable Wickedness invest himself with that Divine Cha∣racter.</P>
<P>This is the scope of the whole Treatise; the Writer gives such Rea∣sons as at present did occur unto him, to prove it. This seems to agree
<PB N="423" REF="431"/>
with the Doctrines of the most Reverenc'd Authors of all Times, Na∣tions and Religions. The best and wisest of Kings have ever acknow∣ledg'd it. The present King of <HI>France</HI> has declar'd that Kings have that happy want of Power, that they can do nothing contrary to the Laws of their Country, and grounds his Quarrel with the King of <HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 1667. upon that Principle▪ King <HI>James</HI> in his Speech to the Parliament <HI>Anno</HI> 1603. doth in the highest degree assert it: The Scripture seems to declare it. If nevertheless the Writer was mistaken, he might have been refuted by Law, Reason and Scripture; and no Man for such matters was ever otherwise punish'd, than by being made to see his Error; and it has not (as I think) been ever known that they had been refer'd to the Judgment of a Jury, compos'd of Men utterly unable to comprehend them.</P>
<P>But there was little of this in my Case; the extravagance of my Prosecutors goes higher: the above-mention'd Treatise was never finish'd, nor could be in many years, and most probably would never have been. So much as is of it was written long since, never review'd nor shewn to any Man; and the fiftieth part of it was not produc'd, and not the tenth of that offer'd to be read. That which was never known to those who are said to have conspir'd with me, was said to be intended to stir up the People in Prosecution of the Designs of those Conspi∣rators.</P>
<P>When nothing of particular Application to Time, Place, or Person, could be found in it, (as has ever been done by those who endeavour'd to raise Insurrections) all was supply'd by <HI>Innuendo's.</HI></P>
<P>Whatsoever is said of the Expulsion of <HI>Tarquin;</HI> the Insurrection against <HI>Nero;</HI> the Slaughter of <HI>Caligula,</HI> or <HI>Domitian;</HI> the Translation of the Crown of <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Meroveus</HI> his Race to <HI>Pepin,</HI> and from his Descendents to <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> and the like, was apply'd by <HI>Innuendo</HI> to the King.</P>
<P>They have not consider'd, that if such Acts of State be not good, there is not a King in the World that has any Title to the Crown he wears; nor can have any, unless he could deduce his Pedegree from the eldest Son of <HI>Noah,</HI> and shew that the Succession had still continu'd in the eldest of the eldest Line, and been so deduc'd to him.</P>
<P>Every one may see what advantage this would be to all the Kings of the World; and whether that failing, it were not better for them to ac∣knowledg they had receiv'd their Crowns by the Consent of willing Nations, or to have no better Title to them than Usurpation and Vio∣lence, which by the same ways may be taken from them.</P>
<P>But I was long since told that I must die, or the Plot must die.</P>
<P>Lest the means of destroying the best Protestants in <HI>England</HI> should fail, the Bench must be fill'd with such as had been Blemishes to the Bar.</P>
<P>None but such as these would have advis'd with the King's Council of the means of bringing a Man to death; suffer'd a Jury to be pack'd by the King's Solicitors, and the Under-Sheriff; admit of Jury men who are not Freeholders; receive such Evidence as is above mention d; refuse a Copy of an Indictment, or suffer the Statute of 46 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. to be read, that doth expresly Enact, It should in no case be deny'd to any Man upon any occasion whatsoever; over-rule the most important Points of Law without hearing. And whereas the Statute, 25 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.
<PB N="424" REF="432"/>
upon which they said I should be try'd, doth reserve to the Parliament all Constructions to be made in Points of Treason, they could assume to themselves not only a Power to make Constructions, but such Con∣structions as neither agree with Law, Reason, or common Sense.</P>
<P>By these means I am brought to this Place. The Lord forgive these Practices, and avert the Evils that threaten the Nation from them. The Lord sanctify these my Sufferings unto me; and tho I fall as a Sacrifice to Idols, suffer not Idolatry to be establish'd in this Land. Bless thy People, and save them. Defend thy own Cause, and defend those that defend it. Stir up such as are saint; direct those that are willing; con∣firm those that waver; give Wisdom and Integrity unto all. Order all things so as may most redound to thine own Glory. Grant that I may die glorifying Thee for all thy Mercys, and that at the last Thou hast permitted me to be singl'd out as a Witness of thy Truth, and even by the Confession of my Opposers, for that OLD CAUSE in which I was srom my Youth engag'd, and for which Thou hast often and wonderfully declar'd thy Self.</P>
