<P>THOMAS AND SALLY: OR, The Sailor's Return. A MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT. As it is performed at the Theatre Royal in Covent-Garden. The MUSIC composed by DOCTOR ARNE.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed for G. KEARSLY, at the Golden Lion, in Ludgate-street; and J. COOTE, at the King's Arms, in Pater-noster Row. MDCCLXI.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE public has made so little diffi∣culty hitherto, in swallowing nau∣seous, or at best, insipid verses, when they have been wrapped up in agreeable music; that to offer a word, either by way of defence, or apology, for the fol∣lowing trifle, seems altogether unne∣cessary.</P>
<P>IT will be easily believed, that the author did not write it with a view to acquire the reputation of a genius: he must be a simpleton indeed, who hopes to give people an idea of his wealth by shewing them a handful of farthings. He wrote it merely to comply with the request of a theatrical person, whom he had an inclination to oblige; it was de∣signed
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
and finished in somewhat less than a fortnight; and his excuse for now suf∣fering it to appear in print (and he really thinks such an excuse necessary) must be the nature of a musical entertainment, which requires, that the words should be put into the hands of the audience, who would otherwise find it impossible to ac∣company the performers in what they sing upon the stage.</P>
<P>HE is no stranger to the whimsical prejudice, which inclines most people to measure the worth of dramatic pieces by their length; and because a musical en∣tertainment is unavoidably the shortest of any, makes them, for that reason, deny its being capable of any degree of merit at all. But though what he here ven∣tures into the world, is neither a Tragedy, a Comedy, or even so much as a Comedy of two acts; he flatters himself, there are some few, who will not condemn it, merely because it is not, what it was not
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
designed for: he hopes they will consi∣der, that when he sat down to write it, he sat down to write a musical entertain∣ment; and that a certain poet and critic, who is allowed to have been a tolerable judge in such matters, has told us, no au∣thor can compass more than he intends.</P>
<P>IF after this, any persons have an in∣clination to find fault with it, they are heartily welcome: nay, he will so far subscribe to their opinion, as to confess, there are some as bad lines in it, as the worst dablers in sing-song ever were guilty of; but he thought it needless to correct them, as every thing of this kind must be castrated, in order to make it perfectly musical; and stretched and altered, to fit the shape of the stage. Howe∣ver, he would certainly point out the exceptionable lines, to shew he is not ig∣norant of them; but that he takes it for granted, there will be people enough ready to save him that trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6"/>THUS far by way of Preface; which the author has written, only because he is assured there is nothing so acceptable to the purchasers of any thing in the form of a book, now a-days, as a reasonable pennyworth in print and paper; and he had a mind to avail himself of the advan∣tages attending an additional half-sheet.</P>
<P>FOR the same reason too he might possibly have attempted a Dedication; but, unfortunately, the only personages likely to patronize his performance are united in a particular society; and he was at a loss in what manner to order their titles, so as to make a proper blazon at the head of a page. However, in this place he would be understood to inscribe the following rhimes to those vagrant choiresters, who, like the bards of old, sing verses about the public streets; and if, when they
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
have thought proper to advance the fol∣lowing ballads to a place in the <HI>Chimney∣sweeper's Garland,</HI> the <HI>Sweetheart's Delight,</HI> or any other of their ingenious collections; they should, (thro' their novelty, and the prevailing argument of playhouse tunes) be the means of rendering more reason∣able in their demands, those grinders of the muses, who have the conscience to expect six and thirty pretty songs in one book for a halfpenny; he shall think the time, and pains they cost him in compo∣sing, very well bestowed.</P>
<P>TO conclude. The author thinks there is no doubt, on account of the music, which is admirable; and the performance, which will be excellent; but this little piece must come off well upon the stage; but after having been acquitted there, he foresees, some busy people will be for bringing it before the judges in the court of criticism. Now he applies himself
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
to the said judges, requiring them to consider all such proceedings as arbitrary, at least, if not unprecedented: He desires, that they will suffer the insignificancy of this piece, to screen it from their cog∣nizance; and that they will not attempt to break a butterfly upon a wheel.</P>
