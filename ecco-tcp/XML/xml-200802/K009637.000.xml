<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Tea was drank and ta'en away,</L>
<L>No Soul had any thing to say;</L>
<L>The Weather, and the usual din</L>
<L>A fresh were going to begin;</L>
<L>Fashion and Scandal, drain'd before,</L>
<L>On Carpet had been brought once more,</L>
<L>But for <HI>Blundrella,</HI> common Pest,</L>
<L>Of the Polite, the standing Jest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>BLUNDRELLA</HI> Idol of the Vain,</L>
<L>And first in the Loquacious Train;</L>
<L>In all things ignorant and weak,</L>
<L>Yet on all Subjects would she speak;</L>
<L>And of her own Perfections vaunted,</L>
<L>Still daunting all, herself undaunted;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>Of a most contradicting Spirit,</L>
<L>And envious of another's Merit.</L>
<L>This Creature thus, with saucy Air,</L>
<L>Addrest <HI>Belinda,</HI> blooming Fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MADAM! I'm told you sing; I long</L>
<L>To have the honour of a Song:</L>
<L>Much better bred than to refuse,</L>
<L><HI>Belinda</HI> pleads the old Excuse;</L>
<L>She's caught a Cold, and feigns a Cough,</L>
<L>But that, alas! won't bring her off;</L>
<L><HI>Blundrella</HI> urges her Request,</L>
<L>Now seconded by all the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT length, unwilling to appear</L>
<L>Affected, peevish, or severe,</L>
<L>The lovely Virgin tun'd her Voice,</L>
<L>More out of Complaisance than Choice:</L>
<L>While all were with her Musick pleas'd,</L>
<L>But she who had the Charmer teaz'd;</L>
<L>Who, rude, unmanner'd, and abrupt!</L>
<L>Did thus <HI>Belinda</HI> interrupt:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MADAM, (said the affected Thing)</L>
<L>Did you ne'er hear <HI>Squallinda</HI> sing?</L>
<L>I've heard her sing that very Song,</L>
<L>Would charm the whole Seraphic Throng;</L>
<L>Of all the Singers her for me,</L>
<L>She sings so sweet, so clear, so free!</L>
<L>But, Madam! can't you sing another?</L>
<L>That Song, I hope, has got a Brother:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5"/>Let us have that which the <HI>Fustina</HI></L>
<L>Sings when she hangs on <HI>Senisino</HI>;</L>
<L>Its Name I have forgot, no matter,</L>
<L>'Tis that which makes the Boxes clatter:</L>
<L>Or, Madam! but I beg your Pardon,</L>
<L>There is a Song, that in the Garden</L>
<L><HI>Cuzzoni</HI> sings unto her Son;</L>
<L>That, or another, 'tis all one.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>BELINDA</HI> blush'd with Shame and Rage;</L>
<L>But yet, unwilling to engage</L>
<L>So bold a Foe in such a Fray,</L>
<L>She let the Creature have her Way:</L>
<L>And, tho' at sight she sung her Part,</L>
<L>And was a Mistress in the Art,</L>
<L>Pleaded her want of Voice and Skill;</L>
<L>Which made <HI>Blundrella</HI> prouder still.</L>
<L>Who grew insufferably vain,</L>
<L>And alter'd both her Voice and Strain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHE talk'd of Singers and Composers,</L>
<L>Of their Admirers and Opposers,</L>
<L>Of the <HI>Cuzzoni</HI> and <HI>Faustini,</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>Handel</HI> and of <HI>Bononcini</HI>;</L>
<L>One was to rough, t'other to smooth,</L>
<L><HI>Artillo</HI> only hit her Tooth;</L>
<L>And <HI>Tamo Tanto</HI> was a Song</L>
<L>Would give her Pleasure all day long.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FULL loftily she gave her Vote,</L>
<L>This had no Voice, and that no Throat;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>That <HI>Heideigger</HI> had receiv'd a Letter,</L>
<L>And we should shortly have a better;</L>
<L>A Messenger was sent to <HI>Dover</HI></L>
<L>To wait the Lady's coming over,</L>
<L>Who should no sooner hither come,</L>
<L>But she would strike all others dumb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHE likewise grew exceeding witty</L>
<L>Upon the Consorts in the City;</L>
<L>'Tis true, she lik'd the <HI>Castle</HI> best,</L>
<L>But yet she made 'em both a Jest:</L>
<L>Nor did she much admire the <HI>Crown,</HI></L>
<L>But as 'twas t'other End o' the Town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHE next of Masters 'gan to preach;</L>
<L>The <HI>English</HI> were not fit to teach,</L>
<L><HI>Italians</HI> were the only Men,</L>
<L>And ev'n of those not one in ten;</L>
<L>For she had heard a Lady say,</L>
<L>Scarce two in Town could sing or play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT with Composers, Players, Singers,</L>
<L>Performance, Gusto, Voices, Fingers,</L>
<L>She ran herself quite out of breath,</L>
<L>And talk'd the Company to Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN haply, with engaging Air,</L>
<L><HI>Eugenio,</HI> darling of the Fair,</L>
<L>Who touches charmingly the Flute,</L>
<L>Enter'd, and struck <HI>Blundrella</HI> mute;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7"/>And kept her Clack-eternal under</L>
<L>For near a Minute, There's a wonder!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>EUGENIO</HI> must expect his Share;</L>
<L>For scarce he had assum'd a Chair,</L>
<L>But she, impatient, Silence broke,</L>
<L>And thus th' Eternal Teazer spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW for a Tune, my pretty Man!</L>
<L>Nay, you shall play, say what you can:</L>
<L>Ladies! he's the delightful'st Creature</L>
<L>You never knew, no Soul play sweeter:</L>
<L>Nay, prithee now don't make a Rout,</L>
<L>Here 'tis Egad, come — pull it out.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT mortal Man could stand the Tryal!</L>
<L>He must consent, there's no denial,</L>
<L>So, for meer quiet Sake, he plays,</L>
<L>While she e'en stifles him with Praise,</L>
<L>And worries the poor Man to death,</L>
<L>Nor suffers him to take his breath;</L>
<L>But calls for Tune on Tune so fast,</L>
<L><HI>Eugenio</HI> is quite tir'd at last,</L>
<L>And begs a Truce upon Parole,</L>
<L>He'll play anon with all his soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW you must know <HI>Belinda</HI>'s Charms</L>
<L>Had giv'n his Heart no small Alarms;</L>
<L>He was her Servant most avow'd</L>
<L>And happiest of the sighing Crowd.</L>
<L><HI>Sophronia,</HI> being her near Relation,</L>
<L>Haply laid hold on this Cessation;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8"/>And, to <HI>Eugenio</HI> drawing near,</L>
<L>She whisper'd softly in his Ear,</L>
<L>Told him <HI>Blundrella</HI>'s vile Assurance,</L>
<L>And sweet <HI>Belinda</HI>'s mild Endurance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>EUGENIO</HI> instantly was fir'd,</L>
<L>Rage and Revenge his Mind inspir'd:</L>
<L>He re-assum'd his Spech and Flute,</L>
<L>And thus <HI>Blundrella</HI> did salute;</L>
<L>Madam, (said he) before I go,</L>
<L>Your dear Commands I'd gladly know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>BLUNDRELLA</HI> rear'd her Crest aloft,</L>
<L>And begg'd him to play something soft:</L>
<L>What think you, Madam, of <HI>AL OMBRA?</HI></L>
<L>That's poor dull Stuff, do ye like <HI>SGOMBRA?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Si Caro,</HI> if you please, said she:</L>
<L>He play'd the Tune of <HI>Children three.</HI></L>
<L>She was in Raptures, and intreated</L>
<L>The self same Tune might be repeated.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE chang'd his Airs, and, to her Shame,</L>
<L>She took ten others for the same.</L>
<L>In short, <HI>Eugenio</HI> play'd her off,</L>
<L>And made her all the Circle's Scoff:</L>
<L>While, stupid she! ascrib'd to Wit and Sense</L>
<L>The Laughter rais'd by her Impertinence.</L>
