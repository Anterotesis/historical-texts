<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>After a short introduction, which states the miraculous acts of Christ, and serves to mark the period at which the Poem commences, Satan goes forth by night into the wilderness, and finds himself in the very spot, where he had in vain practised his temptations upon Christ: Here he falls into meditation upon that unsuccessful interview, and vents himself in soliloquy: Indignant under disappointment and impatient to repair his defeat, he ascends to the summit of the mountain, from whence he had exhibited the kingdoms of the earth, and calls the Devils from all parts of the Heathen world: The whole host of Infernals as∣semble at his summons: The chief leaders are enumerated, their persons and attributes described: Satan addresses them, and proposes the subject matter for their consultation, namely, By what means to counteract the power of Christ upon earth: Baal delivers his sentiments by stating difficulties and objections without any decided opinion unless for seduc∣tion in the general: Moloch angrily resents what he considers as pointed at himself, and speaks disdainfully against the proposal of seduc∣tion, as not only desperate but disgraceful: Belial replies, and after much circumlocution suggests a temptation to be set on foot by Mam∣mon: He is interrupted by Satan, who reproves him for certain di∣gressions in his speech, but adopts his hint of employing Mammon, and calls upon that evil Spirit to attempt the fidelity of Judas Iscariot, whom he points out to him as the only one of the Disciples open to se∣duction: Mammon at first affects to excuse himself from the undertak∣ing, but in conclusion accepts it, and taking wing in presence of the whole applauding host sets out upon his embassy, directing his course to the city of Jerusalem.</P>

<L>HAIL, awful CALVARY! forsaking now</L>
<L>Aonian haunts and the unhallow'd Nine,</L>
<L>I visit thy sad mount, and thence invite</L>
<L>The mournful echoes to my deep-ton'd harp,</L>
<L>Hymning the whilst in solemn numbers praise <MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>To God for mercies purchas'd by the death</L>
<L>Of that mysterious Being, virgin-born,</L>
<L>Savior of lost mankind, who on the cross,</L>
<L>Lord though he be of life and one with God,</L>
<L>In mortal pangs expir'd; there to atone <MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>For a degenerate world, by his pure blood</L>
<L>To wash original corruption out,</L>
<L>And rising victor from the grave dispel</L>
<L>Sin and it's offspring Death, with all the train</L>
<L>Of idol gods, usurping earth and heav'n.<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>Now had the wond'rous acts by JESUS wrought</L>
<L>Spread wide his fame thro' all Judaea's realm;</L>
<L>The leper cleans'd, the blind to sight restor'd,</L>
<L>The sick to health and ev'n the dead to life,</L>
<L>Tho' warn'd to silence, for his modest ear <MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Sought not the praise of men, so much the more</L>
<L>Publish'd his mercies; Daemons at his call</L>
<L>With horrid shrieks, that testified his power,</L>
<L>Came forth from men possest and fled; his voice</L>
<L>Rebuk'd the seas and winds; vast was the throng <MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>That follow'd where he led, and thousands found</L>
<L>In the waste wilderness mirac'lous food:</L>
<L>They saw, they marvel'd, and of force confest</L>
<L>Messias in his power, not so in form;</L>
<L>For there no comeliness, no outward grace,<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>No princely state appear'd: Slow to renounce</L>
<L>Illusions long indulg'd, their wavering minds</L>
<L>'Twixt two opinions halted, while in place</L>
<L>Of these bright visions they beheld a man</L>
<L>Lowly and meek, a houseless wanderer,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>That had not where on earth to lay his head:—</L>
<L>Such can our Israel's great Restorer be,</L>
<L>Such our Messias?—Thus their troubled thoughts</L>
<L>Like meeting currents clash'd; when as he spake</L>
<L>Truth flow'd resistless from his lips, his eyes <MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>Beam'd mercy, and his Father's glory shone</L>
<L>Effulgent in his face; then every tongue</L>
<L>Was hush'd to silence, every doubt dispell'd,</L>
<L>And every heart confess'd him Lord and Christ.</L>
<L>'Twas night, when SATAN, prince of darkness call'd,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>And fitly call'd, for evil hates the day,</L>
<L>Walk'd forth on hellish meditation bent,</L>
<L>Prowling the wilderness: Where'er he trode,</L>
<L>Earth quak'd beneath his foot; before him roll'd</L>
<L>Thick cloud and vapour, making night's dark shade <MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>More black and terrible; the beasts of prey,</L>
<L>Every wild thing that roams the savage waste</L>
<L>And howling to the moon demands it's food,</L>
<L>Fled his approach; the lion and the pard</L>
<L>Scented the blast and slunk into their dens; <MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>For whilst his breast with raging passions boil'd,</L>
<L>Hatred, revenge and blasphemous despight,</L>
<L>The sighs he vented from the hell within</L>
<L>Breath'd death into the air; his haggard eyes,</L>
<L>Which still in speechless agonies he roll'd,<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>Out-glar'd the hyaena's; other fires than their's</L>
<L>To light his dismal path he needed none.</L>
<L>Now, having stretch'd athwart the sandy wild</L>
<L>Clear to its rocky verge, the Arch-fiend paus'd</L>
<L>And upward cast his eye, if haply there <MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>Darkling he might discern what saucy mound</L>
<L>Dar'd to arrest his course; for yet there dwelt</L>
<L>Such vigor in his wing, nor depth, nor heighth,</L>
<L>Mountains nor seas might check his bold career,</L>
<L>Were he so purpos'd; neither would he deign <MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>To ask one charitable star for light,</L>
<L>Thoughtful of former glory, when he soar'd</L>
<L>Son of the morning far above their spheres.</L>
<L>Whereat he 'gan put forth his plumed vans</L>
<L>From either shoulder stretcht for flight, when soon <MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>The fuel'd clouds to fierce encounter rush'd,</L>
<L>Loud thunders bellow'd, and the lightning's flash</L>
<L>Smote on the craggy cliff; at sight whereof</L>
<L>Conscious that now he press'd the fatal spot,</L>
<L>Where late he commun'd with the Son of God,<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>Who for the space of forty days and nights</L>
<L>Foil'd ev'ry vain device, with shame abash'd</L>
<L>And pondering in his mind his foul defeat,</L>
<L>Down, down at once his flagging pinions fell</L>
<L>Close cow'ring to his ribs: As some proud ship <MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>Between the tropics o'er th' Atlantic wave</L>
<L>Speeding amain to reach her destin'd port,</L>
<L>If chance th' experienc'd mariner espies</L>

<L>Yes, hateful wilderness, detested rocks,</L>
<L>Whom I would curse, had Nature left one blade <MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>On your bare ribs, which cursing I might blast,</L>
<L>Full well I know you; deep, too deep engrav'd</L>
<L>On memory's tablet your rude horrors live.</L>
<L>And you, officious lightnings, hide your fires!</L>
<L>Come, Night, again; let central darkness shrowd <MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>Scenes, whose tormenting recollection stabs</L>
<L>My unavenged soul. Can I forget</L>
<L>This Son of Joseph? Son of God henceforth</L>
<L>Of force I must confess him, for what less</L>
<L>Than god-like constancy could have withstood <MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>Temptations great and terrible as mine?</L>
<L>Something which man is not he needs must be,</L>
<L>Virtue, that angels boast not, he must have,</L>
<L>Else had my snares enclos'd him, else the world,</L>
<L>Which then was mine to give, had been a bribe <MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Too glorious not to dazzle every eye</L>
<L>But his, who made those glories what they are.</L>
<L>Still I must doubt the Father's love sincere,</L>
<L>Tho' loudly vouch'd by his own voice from heav'n:</L>
<L>Is this a father's love, is this his care,<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>Here to expose him to this desart wild</L>
<L>Forty long sleepless nights and fasting days,</L>

<L>More fierce than this loud storm; nay, fiercer still,<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>To me than all more terrible, to me,</L>
<L>Foe of his life inveterate and avow'd?</L>
<L>Rare sample of God's love! If here his CHRIST</L>
<L>Encounter'd aught of danger; and if none,</L>
<L>What else could prompt him to this vain display <MILESTONE N="130"/></L>
<L>Of voluntary penance, but the love</L>
<L>Of flattery and a despicable wish</L>
<L>To hear himself applauded? In this spot,</L>
<L>Beneath the jutting roof of this rude cliff,</L>
<L>I first surpriz'd this wand'ring Son of God,<MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>This Savior of the world: Fainting he seem'd</L>
<L>With thirst and hunger, pale as death his cheek,</L>
<L>His hollow eyes deep sunk, and from his brow</L>
<L>Big drops of sweat distill'd, as one o'erspent</L>
<L>And sinking to the earth there to expire:<MILESTONE N="140"/></L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>A ready tale he had for pity's ear,</L>
<L>A melancholy list of wants and woes;</L>
<L>He had not tasted food, and fairly own'd</L>
<L>That Nature's cravings were intense; when I,</L>
<L>Glad at the heart to find him thus besieg'd <MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
<L>With appetite so eager, stooping down,</L>
<L>From the dissever'd fragments, that here lie</L>
<L>About the base of this storm-beaten rock,</L>
<L>Chose out a few smooth stones, and tempting said,</L>
<L>If thou art hungry, eat; convert these stones,<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>If thou art God's own Son, to bread, and eat!</L>
<L>But he not so beguil'd spurn'd them away,</L>
<L>And silenc'd me with text of holy writ:</L>
<L>A nobler appetite I next assail'd,</L>
<L>Ambition; to the mountain's top we soar'd; <MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>I spread the kingdoms of the earth in sight,</L>
<L>Fit sight to whet the hunger of the mind;</L>
<L>But mind and body he alike would starve,</L>
<L>Nor thank nor homage render back for food</L>
<L>Of my providing: One last hope remain'd; <MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>Methought there was a godly pride about him,</L>
<L>Which with right holy flattery I might win:</L>
<L>Upon the temple's topmost pinnacle</L>
<L>I plac'd this scorner of an earthly crown,</L>
<L>And bade him be a God; Cast thyself down; <MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>Behold, quoth I, the Angels are on wing</L>
<L>To bear thee up unhurt: With stern rebuke,</L>

<L>Some power unseen control'd me, down I fell,</L>
<L>Down from the giddy eminence I plung'd,<MILESTONE N="170"/></L>
<L>And left him to his Angels, whilst their hymns</L>
<L>And halelujahs echo'd through the air</L>
<L>His triumphs and my second fall from heav'n.</L>
<L>And now if dark despair shall reach this heart,</L>
<L>Which of hell's tetrarchs can arraign their king,<MILESTONE N="175"/></L>
<L>Or fix on me his share of public loss</L>
<L>And overthrow sustain'd in this attack?</L>
<L>None, for none dare. If I, till now supreme,</L>
<L>Great idol of the Gentile world, for whom</L>
<L>So many groves, so many altars blaze; <MILESTONE N="180"/></L>
<L>If I, to whom by various names ador'd</L>
<L>Thousands of temples rife, whilst one alone,</L>
<L>One solitary pile on Sion's hill</L>
<L>Echoes the praise of God, neglected else</L>
<L>Of all; if I, if SATAN must submit <MILESTONE N="185"/></L>
<L>To CHRIST, revenge to patience, war to peace,</L>
<L>And men must learn new maxims of forgiveness,</L>
<L>Maxims I neither practise nor instil,</L>

<L>With indignation like the labouring earth,</L>
<L>Which subterranean vapors undermine,</L>

<L>The kingdoms of the earth, whilst at his side <MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>CHRIST's humble virtue stood, on other realms,</L>
<L>Realms of immortal happiness, intent:</L>

<L>Screams out his shrill alarm, at sound whereof <MILESTONE N="210"/></L>

<L>No more, for soon was heard the distant sound</L>
<L>Of wings that beat the air; from every point</L>

<L>From Grete, from Cyprus and the Ionian coast,</L>
<L>From Egypt, Afric and the Ausonian shores,<MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L>Gods of all names, dimensions and degrees.</L>
<L>Great was their sovereign's triumph to behold</L>
<L>This prompt obedience to his high command;</L>
<L>For now descending on the desart heath</L>
<L>To martial music, the infernal host <MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
<L>In bands and columns, by their chiefs arrang'd,</L>

<L>SATAN awhile survey'd, then sighing cried,</L>
<L>Oh! worthy of command, had all like thee</L>

<L>Thence as he glanc'd his eye, far other form</L>

<L>CHEMOS, the sin of Moab; power obscene,</L>

<L>Zidonian goddess, ASHTORETH her name;</L>

<L>Witness that Magdalen, whose frantic breast,</L>
<L>Till by CHRIST's mercy heal'd, sev'n daemons rent,</L>
<L>All sin-begotten, all her brood accurst.</L>
<L>BUT SATAN, whose stern heart, stranger to love,<MILESTONE N="300"/></L>
<L>All weakness tho' in shape of sin disdain'd,</L>
<L>And only priz'd spirits more like himself,</L>

<L>He lov'd not camps nor the rude toils of war;</L>
<L>BELIAL his name; around his temples twin'd</L>
<L>A wreath of roses, and, where'er he pass'd,</L>

<L>Yet from his lips sweet eloquence distill'd,</L>

<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>Mean truce and base capitulating terms;</L>
<L>Therefore by SATAN held in slight account,<MILESTONE N="340"/></L>
<L>For devils affect a dignity in sin.</L>
<L>Last in the field, and from the rest apart,</L>
<L>Was MAMMON; cautious was his step and slow,</L>

<L>For gain and usury engross'd his soul,</L>

<L>And gold in hell, MAMMON had spurn'd the bliss,<MILESTONE N="350"/></L>
<L>And hugg'd the treasure cheaply earn'd with pain.</L>
<L>His princes thus review'd, from the hill top</L>
<L>SATAN swift-glancing flew, and in the midst</L>
<L>Rose like a meteor; whereat all the host</L>
<L>Sent up a general shout: he with his hand <MILESTONE N="355"/></L>
<L>Gave sign, and wheel'd the Stygian phalanx round,</L>

<L>Virtues, which hell itself cannot corrupt.</L>
<L>I mean not to declame: The occasion told</L>

<L>All waste of words forbids. God's Son on earth,</L>
<L>CHRIST, the reveal'd Messias, how to oppose <MILESTONE N="375"/></L>
<L>Is now the question; by what force, or power—</L>
<L>Temptations have been tried, I name not them—</L>
<L>Or dark conspiracy, we may pull down</L>
<L>This sun of righteousness from his bright sphere</L>
<L>Declare, who can: I pause for a reply.<MILESTONE N="380"/></L>
<L>Silence ensu'd, whilst every eye was turn'd</L>
<L>Instinctively on BAAL; he of all</L>
<L>Hell's magi fill'd the seat of wisdom chief:</L>
<L>Experienc'd long in craft, and nothing apt</L>
<L>To give strait counsel, slow of speech he was; <MILESTONE N="385"/></L>
<L>To hint, propound, dilate, and so entice</L>
<L>Other opinions forth, them to refute,</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>And thereon build his own, was all his art.</L>
<L>After long pause and hesitation feign'd,</L>

<L>Why thus on me, as I were worthy, me,</L>
<L>Lost being like yourselves, as I alone</L>
<L>Cou'd compass this high argument, on me,</L>

<L>These scrutinizing looks, I muse; and aw'd <MILESTONE N="395"/></L>
<L>By this your expectation fain wou'd shrink</L>
<L>From the great task to silence, had you not</L>
<L>O'er these poor faculties such full controul,</L>
<L>As to put by all pleas, and call them forth</L>
<L>In heav'n or earth, or hell's profound abyss,<MILESTONE N="400"/></L>
<L>Your's in all uses, present at all hours.</L>
<L>Our kingly chief hath told us we are met</L>

<L>May try our fortune in another field;</L>
<L>Worse fortune than in heav'n befell our arms,<MILESTONE N="405"/></L>
<L>Worse downfall than to hell, we cannot prove.</L>
<L>But with the scene our action too must change:</L>
<L>How? to what warfare? Circumvention, fraud,</L>
<L>Seduction; these are earthly weapons, these</L>
<L>As man to man opposes, so must we <MILESTONE N="410"/></L>
<L>To CHRIST incarnate. There be some, who cry,</L>

<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>I honor such bold counsellors, and yield</L>

<L>Upon our priests and altars? For myself,</L>
<L>What powers I had I shall not soon forget;</L>
<L>What I have left I know, and for your use</L>

<L>Where they must surely fail. The Jews pretend <MILESTONE N="425"/></L>
<L>That CHRIST colludes with Belzebub; the Jews</L>
<L>As far mistake my nature as my name:</L>
<L>The fallacy, O peers, confutes itself,</L>
<L>Forg'd to disparage CHRIST, not honor me:</L>
<L>Oh! that I had his wonder-working powers; <MILESTONE N="430"/></L>
<L>I'm not that fool to turn them on myself:</L>
<L>No, my brave friends, I've yet too much to lose;</L>
<L>Though Babylon's proud shrines are laid in dust,</L>

<L>They bear my thunder and they spread my fame:</L>
<L>Therefore no more of Belzebub and CHRIST;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>No league, no compact can we hold together.</L>
<L>What then ensues? Despair? Perish the thought!</L>
<L>The brave renounce it, and the wise prevent; <MILESTONE N="440"/></L>
<L>You are both wise and brave. Our leader says</L>
<L>Temptations have been tried, and tried in vain,</L>
<L>Himself the tempter. Who will tread that ground,</L>
<L>Where he was foil'd? For Adam a mere toy,</L>
<L>An apple serv'd; CHRIST is not brib'd by worlds:<MILESTONE N="445"/></L>
<L>So much the second Man exceeds the first</L>
<L>In strength and glory. But tho' CHRIST himself</L>
<L>Will not be tempted, those who hear him may:</L>
<L>Jews may be urg'd to envy, to revenge,</L>
<L>To murder; a rebellious race of old,<MILESTONE N="450"/></L>
<L>To kill a prophet or betray his God</L>
<L>What Jew was ever found to need the spur?</L>
<L>Wist ye not what a train this preacher hath,</L>

<L>Here is our hope. I leave it to your thoughts.</L>
<L>He ceas'd, but neither murmur nor applause</L>
<L>Follow'd his speech, for MOLOCH, whose fell heart</L>
<L>Ill stomach'd this tame counsel, least of all</L>
<L>Taunts thinly cover'd under mask of praise,<MILESTONE N="460"/></L>
<L>Sprung forth impetuous, and with scowling brow</L>

<L>War, open war is all my note: I rise</L>

<L>Where honesty shou'd wear it, in my face;</L>
<L>That face from danger I did never hide,</L>
<L>How then from him? Nor am I by his praise</L>
<L>More honor'd than by his dissenting voice:</L>
<L>For whilst he counsels circumvention, fraud,<MILESTONE N="470"/></L>
<L>Seduction,—if my memory wrongs his words</L>
<L>I yield it to correction,—we stand off</L>
<L>Wide as the poles apart. Much I had hop'd</L>
<L>When the great Tempter fail'd and in your ears</L>
<L>Sung his own honor's dirge, we had heard the last <MILESTONE N="475"/></L>
<L>Of plots and mean temptations; mean I call them,</L>
<L>For great names cannot sanctify mean deeds:</L>

<L>And are we now caballing how to outwit</L>

<L>To that oblivious bourne, whence none return:</L>

<L>When God's own servants rise against his Son,</L>

<L>Greater revenge? What need have we to tempt</L>

<L>Breathless he paus'd, so rapid was the pulse</L>

<L>That this fair world should be so long possess'd</L>

<L>Great is the trouble of my thoughts, O peers,</L>

<L>Nature and office to ascribe to CHRIST;</L>
<L>In form the lowliest of the sons of men,</L>
<L>In miracles omnipotent as God;</L>
<L>Whose voice controuls the stoutest of our host,</L>
<L>Bids the graves open and their dead come forth; <MILESTONE N="600"/></L>
<L>Whose very touch is health; who with a glance</L>
<L>Pervades each heart, absolves it or condemns;</L>
<L>Whose virgin birth credulity scarce owns,</L>
<L>And Nature disavows. Prais'd to all time,</L>
<L>Immortal as himself be the renown <MILESTONE N="605"/></L>
<L>Of that wise spirit, who shall devise the means</L>
<L>By force or fraud to overthrow the power</L>
<L>Of this mysterious foe, what shall I say?—</L>
<L>Priest, Prophet, King, Messias, Son of God.</L>
<L>Yet how God's unity, which well we know <MILESTONE N="610"/></L>
<L>Endures no second, should adopt a Son</L>
<L>And essence indivisible divide,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="30"/>Baffles my weak conjecture: Let that pass!</L>
<L>To such hard doctrines I subscribe no faith:</L>
<L>I'll call him man inspir'd, and wait till death <MILESTONE N="615"/></L>

<L>With snares to catch him, urge the envious priests,</L>
<L>For envy still beneath the altar lurks,</L>

<L>Though MAMMON boasts not of his own success,</L>
<L>How few of human mould have yet withstood <MILESTONE N="625"/></L>
<L>His glittering, golden lures. The sword can kill</L>
<L>Man's body, gold destroys his very soul:</L>
<L>Yet mark me well, I counsel not to tempt</L>
<L>The Master; poverty can do no more</L>
<L>Than his own mortifying penance does,<MILESTONE N="630"/></L>
<L>Hunger and thirst and obstinately starve,</L>
<L>When his mere wish could make the rock a spring</L>
<L>And its hard fragments bread: Yet sure I am</L>
<L>All are not CHRIST's in heart, who with their lips</L>
<L>Confess him; these are men, and therefore frail,<MILESTONE N="635"/></L>
<L>Frail and corruptible: And let none say,</L>
<L>Fear prompts this counsel; I disclaim all fear</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="31"/>But for the general cause: In every heart</L>
<L>Nature hath built my altar; every sect,</L>
<L>Nation and language with one voice confess <MILESTONE N="640"/></L>
<L>Pleasure the sovereign good: The Stoic churl,</L>
<L>The dogged Cynic snarling in his tub,</L>
<L>And all the ragged moralizing crew</L>
<L>Are hypocrites; philosophy itself</L>
<L>Is but my votary beneath a cloak:<MILESTONE N="645"/></L>
<L>It harms not me, though every idol God</L>
<L>Were tumbled from his base; alike I scorn</L>
<L>Sampson's strong nerve and Daniel's flaming zeal:</L>
<L>And let CHRIST preach his mortifying rules,</L>
<L>Let him go forth through all the Gentile world,<MILESTONE N="650"/></L>
<L>And on the ruin of our fanes erect</L>
<L>His church triumphant o'er the gates of hell,</L>
<L>Still, still man's heart will draw the secret sigh</L>
<L>For pleasures unenjoy'd; the gloomy cell</L>
<L>And melancholy fast, the midnight prayer <MILESTONE N="655"/></L>
<L>And pale contrition weeping o'er her lamp</L>
<L>Are penances, from which the sense revolts,</L>
<L>Fines, that compounding superstition pays</L>
<L>For pleasures past, or bribes for more to come.</L>
<L>Enough of this vain boast, here SATAN cried; <MILESTONE N="660"/></L>
<L>More than enough of these voluptuous strains,</L>
<L>Which, tho' they lull the ear, disarm the soul</L>

<L>True wisdom, ever frugal of her speech,<MILESTONE N="665"/></L>

<L>The sum of all our reasoning ends in this,</L>
<L>That nothing but the death of CHRIST can solve</L>
<L>The mystery of his nature; till he falls</L>
<L>Scarce can I say we stand: All voices then,<MILESTONE N="670"/></L>
<L>Though varying in the means, conspire his death;</L>
<L>Some cautiously as BAAL; some with zeal</L>
<L>Precipitate as MOLOCH, whose swift thought</L>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>Mammon, alighting on the Holy Mount, assumes the form and character of a Levite, and under that appearance goes in search of Judas Iscariot. He meets that disciple most opportunely for his purpose in a solitary place, and entering into conversation with him, pretends a commission from the priests and elders for engaging him in their service with the promise of a reward, and urges many insidious arguments for detaching him from his Master: They separate with a promise on the part of Judas to report his final answer to the priests that evening. Christ is now brought to view sitting in the midst of his disciples at his Last Supper: He addresses them in those solemn and affecting terms recorded in the Gospel of Saint John, washes their feet, foretells his death, and points out to them his betrayer in the person of Judas then present: The traitor, perceiving himself discovered, hastily departs. Christ, pity∣ing the affliction of his disciples, tenderly consoles them with the promise of his support under their future tribulations, and concludes with an aweful invocation to the Father in their behalf: whereupon, warning them that his hour is come, he goes forth to the garden. A reflection, naturally springing from the subject, addressed to unbelievers, closes the book.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CALVARY.</HI> BOOK II. THE LAST SUPPER.</HEAD>
<L>NOW on the consecrated Mount of God</L>
<L>MAMMON, invisible to mortal eye,</L>
<L>Stooping the wing from his aerial heighth</L>
<L>With feet unhallow'd lands; a direful pest,</L>
<L>Farthest from heav'n of all that outcast crew,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>Who fell from bliss; fit messenger was he,</L>
<L>And fatal was their choice, who sent him forth</L>
<L>To work corruption's purpose in man's heart;</L>
<L>For in his pow'r excelling he can take</L>
<L>The semblance of each virtue, shift each form,<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>And turn and turn new faces on the world,</L>
<L>Till he hath snar'd a soul; then he appears</L>
<L>In nature as he is, loathsome, obscene,</L>
<L>Rapacious as those filthy monsters feign'd</L>
<L>By fabling poets of amphibious breed,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="40"/>Harpies, of earth and ocean the foul spawn,</L>
<L>Half brute, half human, with cadaverous face</L>
<L>Horribly pale, and hollow hungry eye,</L>
<L>Glaring aghast, with wings outstretch'd to chace</L>
<L>And talons crook'd to pounce their mangled prey.<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>And now by dev'lish spell transform'd he seems</L>
<L>A reverend Levite, bearded to the waist;</L>
<L>Hypocrisy ne'er wore a graver mask:</L>
<L>And still with wolf-like watch he prowls around,</L>
<L>If haply in those haunts he might surprize <MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Occasion to put forth his damning arts,</L>
<L>And from the flock of their good Shepherd cull</L>
<L>One tainted straggler, one, whose sordid soul</L>
<L>Avarice might tempt to take the price of blood,</L>
<L>And sacrifice the Son of God for gold:<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Of CHRIST no care had he, but to elude</L>
<L>His vigilance, which still was all his dread;</L>
<L>Nor of the Twelve, save JUDAS, was there one</L>
<L>Whom to assail; on him alone, on him,</L>
<L>Son of perdition, rested all the hopes <MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>Of SATAN and his legions. Now the fiend</L>

<L>A cripple new restor'd; the very bed,<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>Which from his birth the palsied wretch had press'd,</L>
<L>Now in it's turn was carried, and to all</L>
<L>Triumphantly expos'd: Behold, he cried,</L>
<L>The token of my cure; I am the man</L>
<L>Whom ye all knew, and this the doleful bed,<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>On which, fast bound in misery and pain,</L>

<L>I laid and begg'd for pity and relief:</L>
<L>Lo! I am free! Mark how these new-found limbs</L>

<L>CHRIST gave the word; he spake and I am whole.</L>
<L>This whilst he heard, conviction smote the fiend;</L>
<L>His conscious heart a sudden tremor seiz'd</L>

<L>Hail, son of Simon! peace be to thee, friend!</L>
<L>Fairly encounter'd art thou in good hour,</L>
<L>The priest-like Tempter cried; thy worth is known</L>
<L>To all our Levites, from whose tribe I come</L>

<L>Unknown I well may be, who night and day</L>

<L>Vile and mechanic; to the driv'ling crew</L>
<L>Of children and of women leave that task,</L>

<L>Fine reas'ning we shall have, and well be school'd,</L>
<L>When fishermen turn preachers and instill <MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>Doctrines and laws, which Moses never taught.</L>
<L>Woe to our scribes! Rare mockery of the world</L>
<L>And the world's wisdom, if these simple folk,</L>
<L>Lur'd from their daily drudgery, should set up</L>
<L>Fishers of men; the synagogue, to them <MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>A barren element, will never yield</L>
<L>Such gainful earnings as the sea affords.</L>
<L>And what is CHRIST, that JUDAS so should court</L>
<L>His starving service? What so tempting lure</L>
<L>Hath this deceiver to beguile thy hopes?<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="44"/>Not of this world my kingdom, he hath said;</L>

<L>And wherefore carriest thou that bag about?</L>
<L>A beggar needs no treasurer, and thy Lord</L>
<L>Feeds but by miracle: Alas for him,</L>
<L>Who serves a master, that keeps Sabbath fasts</L>
<L>Forty long days in the bare wilderness,<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>Makes poverty his passport into heav'n,</L>
<L>And bids us throw away life's present means</L>
<L>For doubtful chance of interest after life!</L>
<L>And art thou of all reason so bereft</L>
<L>As to account prosperity a crime,<MILESTONE N="130"/></L>
<L>Or think none blest but him, whose every step</L>
<L>Through misery's thorny path is mark'd with blood?</L>
<L>O son of Simon, take thy last resolve;</L>
<L>Either resign thy body to the worm,</L>

<L>Rich, honor'd, prosperous, and enjoy the world.</L>
<L>The Fiend now paus'd, well pleas'd that he had gain'd</L>
<L>Audience so large; when JUDAS, in whose soul</L>

<L><PB N="43" REF="45"/>That CHRIST, rejected and despis'd of men,</L>

<L>Of what shall never come, we are of all <MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
<L>Most miserable; if we, who bid farewel</L>
<L>To all that Nature holds most dear to share</L>
<L>Sorrows and pains and poverty with CHRIST,</L>

<L>Which he hath promis'd; if, when all is past <MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>And this sad scene concludes, no reck'ning comes,</L>
<L>No grateful compensation after death,</L>
<L>Hard is our fate, and much hath he abus'd</L>
<L>Our weak credulity; but still these hopes</L>
<L>Of an expected glory, though with doubt <MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>And darkness clouded, faint yet not extinct,</L>
<L>Yield not to words; words made them what they are,</L>

<L>Wherefore if these your doctors of the law</L>
<L>Invite me to their conclave but to hear <MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>A railing accusation, I hold off</L>
<L>From their assembly, and to CHRIST adhere,</L>
<L>As to the better reas'ner; and though poor</L>

<L>To them, who bask in sunshine thro' the day,<MILESTONE N="175"/></L>
<L>Night comes with double sadness, whilst to me,</L>
<L>Who toil from morn to noon, from noon to eve,</L>

<L>Low'ring in clouds, darkness is nothing strange,</L>
<L>Nor death a terror: Wealth presents no dower <MILESTONE N="180"/></L>

<L>At length the meek REDEEMER rais'd his eyes,</L>

<L>Muse not if I am sad, nor stand aghast <MILESTONE N="385"/></L>
<L>As doubtful of my constancy; these pangs</L>
<L>And more which I must suffer were foreseen;</L>
<L>The hour now coming comes not by surprize,</L>
<L>It is the consummation of my charge,</L>
<L>And fills the measure of atonement up.<MILESTONE N="390"/></L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="55"/>Shall I then say, Father, avert this hour,</L>

<L>This said, his seamless mantle he threw off,<MILESTONE N="400"/></L>

<L>Never shalt thou do that for one so vile,</L>

<L><PB N="54" REF="56"/>PETER, as yet thou know'st not what I do,<MILESTONE N="415"/></L>

<L>Oh! not my feet alone, my hands, my head,</L>

<L>There needs not this, the meek REDEEMER cried,</L>
<L>Enough is done; thus wash'd, though but in part,</L>
<L>Thou shalt be clean throughout: Yet I'll not say <MILESTONE N="425"/></L>
<L>Ye are all clean: Spite of the Shepherd's care</L>

<L>This lesson of humility and lore?</L>
<L>Ye call me Lord and Master; well ye say,</L>

<L>By these symbolic elements withdrawn,</L>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>Iscariot, having separated himself from Christ, wanders through the streets of the city in a disconsolate manner, and at length arrives at the brook Cedron without the gates. Here he breaks forth into soliloquy, in which, after reviewing his past situation, he affects to justify his pre∣sent motives for betraying his Master to the priests. Christ and his disciples, proceeding to the Mount of Olives, are discovered by him as they are passing the brook in their way thither, and Judas resolves upon availing himself of the opportunity for delivering Christ into the hands of his enemies. In the mean time the priests and elders assemble in the palace of Caiaphas, and there hold a council upon the measures to be pursued for the apprehension of Christ: The high priest harangues the assembly to this immediate purport: In the interim Judas is announced, and being admitted makes his proposal to the council; this produces some observations on the part of Caiaphas, and is objected to by Nicodemus, who after delivering his opinion quits the assembly. Caiaphas then takes up the matter afresh, controverts the sentiments of Nicodemus, and with the approbation of all present closes with the proposals of Judas, and sends out a company with that traiterous disciple to the Mount of Olives, there to apprehend the person of Christ. The assembly breaks up, and the hall is no sooner evacuated by the priests and elders, than their seats are filled by Satan and his infernal spirits. Satan addresses to them a congratulatory speech on the success of Mammon's tempta∣tion, on whom he bestows many high encomiums; an ovation takes place in honor of that daemon, when Chemos appears wounded by the spear of Gabriel, whom he had encountered on the Mount of Olives, where he had been posted as a spy upon the motions of Christ and his disciples. Satan, enraged at the account, sallies forth with a resolution to revenge the attack by punishing the temerity of Gabriel, arms himself for the occasion, and after much proud vaunting of his superior prowess disap∣pears, and the infernal spirits disperse.</P>

<L>DARK came the ev'ning on, and the pale moon,</L>

<L>Of virtue lost, yet in his coward breast</L>
<L>Such languor, dread and cold repugnance dwelt,</L>

<L><PB N="78" REF="81"/>Or e'er the acting of the dreadful deed</L>

<L>Me to betray, as their insulted law <MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>Provokes our elders to destroy their foe?</L>
<L>For Moses they, I for myself oppose;</L>

<L>The danger he foreknows; nay rather helps</L>

<L>Either his own free will makes death it's choice,</L>

<L>Sound out his knell; we fight not against Heav'n.</L>
<L>Let CHRIST, if glory waits him in the grave,</L>

<L>And bade him live again? Stupendous act!</L>

<L><PB N="104" REF="107"/>MAMMON exalted sate, and as the choir</L>

<L>Imperial Lord of this seraphic host,</L>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>A general review of Christ's agony in the garden: His disciples, who are ordered to watch, fall asleep; Christ prays apart; he wakens them, and warns them to watch left they enter into temptation. Satan arrives, and takes post near the spot where Christ is praying in his agony: He is discovered by Gabriel, the supporting angel; their interview describ∣ed: Christ approaches, and reproving Satan, by the word of power casts him to the ground disabled and in torments. Judas now advances with an armed company; betrays his Master with a kiss; Christ is seized and carried away to the palace of the high priest. Satan, unable to rise, laments over his disconsolate condition: He is discovered by Mammon, who consoles him and assists in raising him from the ground: Satan testifies to the power and divinity of Christ, feels a presentiment of his impending doom, and having delivered his last injunctions to Mammon, is lifted from the earth by a stormy gust and carried through the air out fight of that evil spirit, who terrified by the fate of his chief turns to flight and escapes.</P>

<L>O MOUNT of Agony! water'd with tears</L>
<L>From my Redeemer's eyes, and by his knees,</L>
<L>Pressing thy turf, made sacred as the ground,</L>
<L>Where ev'n the Chosen Shepherd might not stand</L>
<L>But with unsandal'd feet, Ah! where is now <MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>That purifying Angel me to cleanse</L>
<L>From this vile world, that so I may approach,</L>
<L>Though but in thought, with a right spi'rit renew'd,</L>
<L>Thy hallow'd solitude? Lo! where the Lord</L>
<L>Sorrowing retires apart: Where are the Three <MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>Station'd to guard his sacred privacy?</L>
<L>Stand they aloof, as their forefathers stood,</L>
<L>When from the midst of darkness, cloud and fire,</L>
<L>JEHOVAH thunder'd out of Sinai's mount?</L>
<L>Ah, no! within that olive grove they lie <MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="117"/>Stretch'd on the ground, a drowsy slumb'ring guard.</L>
<L>And could ye not, ye sleepers, watch one hour</L>
<L>For such a Master? Oh! what heart could taste</L>
<L>Of rest or peace, whilst his was rack'd with pain?</L>
<L>Was it the sighs his suffering virtue breath'd <MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Into the air of sad Gethsemane,</L>
<L>That so entranc'd your senses? Or was he,</L>
<L>The strength'ning Angel, sent from Heav'n to shield</L>
<L>The Savior's anguish from all human eyes,</L>
<L>And veil the mystery of that awful hour?<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Then was that angry cup, full mix'd and red</L>
<L>From God's right hand, presented to his lips:</L>
<L>The bitter essence of origi'nal sin,</L>
<L>With every life-destroying extract, drawn</L>
<L>From man's corruption since, were there infus'd,<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Compounded and resolved into that draught,</L>
<L>Mix'd by the hand of Death and drugg'd in hell.</L>
<L>The coward, shrinking under fortune's blows,</L>
<L>With desperate lip hath oft-times drank and died;</L>
<L>'Tis refuge, 'tis desertion from a post <MILESTONE N="35"/></L>

<L>The accumulated load of punishment,</L>
<L>The mass of vengeance, that amazing whole,</L>

<L>Pure, without spot or blemish? O my soul!<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>Beware, nor to that tabernacle press,</L>
<L>Where clouds and darkness canopy thy God.</L>
<L>Lo! where the Savior kneels; he looks around</L>
<L>For some to succour, to support, some friend,</L>
<L>Whose sympathising eye might beam upon him,<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>And with a moment's glance of pity chear</L>
<L>His desolated spirit. All around</L>
<L>Is vacant horror, solitary, dark;</L>
<L>The partners of his heart, the chosen few,</L>
<L>The friends, who should have watch'd, are wrapt in sleep,<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="119"/>Insensible, supine, oblivious sleep;</L>
<L>Woes multiplied by woe, and that the worst,</L>

<L>His soul revolting from the noisome draught,<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>With eyes to Heav'n uplifted, and a sigh,</L>

<L>Remove this cup!—Then bows his patient head <MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>And qualifies the pray'r—Yet not my will,</L>
<L>But Thine be done!—No voice from Heav'n replies:</L>
<L>All Nature sleeps in silence still as death,</L>
<L>As if the planets in their spheres had paus'd</L>
<L>To watch the trembling balance, on whose point <MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>The fortunes of this globe suspended hung,</L>

<L>'Twas then the strength'ning Angel dealt the blow,</L>
<L>That put the hovering spy of hell to flight,</L>
<L>Seen of our Lord in ambush where he lay.<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>And now the Mourner rises from the earth,</L>
<L>On which he knelt, and a few paces moves</L>
<L>Pensive and slow to find his station'd friends:</L>
<L>He finds them not as friends upon the watch,</L>
<L>Not as God's faithful soldiers should be found,<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="120"/>But at their length stretch'd out in lazy sleep</L>

<L>Could ye not watch one hour? the Sufferer cries:</L>
<L>Watch, for the foe of man is near at hand; <MILESTONE N="95"/></L>
<L>Pray, lest ye fall into the Tempter's snare:</L>
<L>The spi'rit is ready, but the flesh is weak.</L>
<L>So warn'd, he leaves them with this mild rebuke:</L>
<L>A second time he seeks the dismal dell,</L>
<L>Again he prays remission of his woe,<MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>And deprecates the agonizing cup:</L>
<L>Meanwhile his drowsy centinels perceive</L>
<L>A languor, which their senses must obey,</L>
<L>And down they sink, their leaden eye-balls clos'd</L>
<L>As in a death-like trance. Again he comes,<MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>Again he calls, a second warning gives,</L>
<L>And so departs.—Now SATAN on the wing</L>

<L>He of his former self felt no decay,<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>

<L>Still deem'd that heav'n, though lost, contain'd no peer</L>

<L>Over the Gentile nations, and the sight</L>

<L>Summon'd his strength, and conscious that the hour</L>

<L>Put forth his hand, and as he took the cup,</L>

<L>Bold, though unblest, and high innate disdain</L>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>This Book, proposing to treat of the trial and condemnation of Christ, opens with an invocation to the Evangelists, the sacred historians of that event.—Christ, brought before the priests and elders in council, ac∣cused by the witnesses, interrogated by Caiaphas, persists in keeping silence, till being solemnly called upon to declare himself, he answers by an affirmation of the truth. Instantly all voices are let loose upon him, accusing him of blasphemy and pronouncing him worthy of death: He is delivered over to mockery and insult. The Jews resolve to arraign him before Pilate on the following morning. He turns and looks upon Peter, who according to prediction had three several times denied him. The sorrow and contrition of that Disciple is described; he retires apart to bewail his crime and supplicate forgiveness. His prayer and con∣fession in the temple-porch. The council of the Jews resort to Pilate next morning and appeal against Christ. He informs them that by the Roman law no judgment can be given till the accused is confronted with his accusers, and heard in his defence. Now commences the trial of Christ before Pilate, who, finding nothing worthy of death in that just person, refers him to Herod as belonging to his jurisdiction. Herod, after mocking him, arrays him in a gorgeous robe, and in that apparel sends him back to Pilate. He again appears in the judgment hall be∣fore Pilate, who after many fruitless efforts to save him, the Jews still urging him by their clamorous importunity to crucify him, finding no other way to prevent a tumult of the people, after declaring himself in∣nocent of the blood of Jesus by the ceremony of washing his hands before the multitude, delivers him to be crucified.</P>

<L>The rabble throng rush in, and at the bar</L>

<L>More than the dignity of conscious truth,<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>Which knows itself prejudg'd and scorns a plea.</L>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>Judas Iscariot seized with remorse returns the thirty pieces of silver to the priests and departs: Mammon reassumes the habit of a Levite, and meeting Judas after he had returned the money to the priests, instigates him to destroy himself. That evil spirit now takes wing and repairs to the wilderness, convenes the daemons from all parts of Palestine, and informing them of Satan's expulsion from earth, warns them by his command to betake themselves to flight before the hour of Christ's cru∣cifixion: This is no sooner announced than the whole infernal host breaks up in disorder and disperses to various parts of the world therein de∣scribed.—The subject of the Crucifixion is now brought forward: The procession sets out for Mount Calvary; Christ bearing his cross is be∣wailed by the spectators as he passes: He is seen by Gabriel and the angels with him from the mount, on which they were stationed: He addresses himself to the daughters of Jerusalem: The executioners nail his hands and feet to the cross; the priests revile him and call upon him to come down; one of the malefactors crucified with him casts the same in his teeth; he is reproved by the other, whose penitence is rewarded by the promise of immediate salvation and glory: Christ from the cross recommends his mother to John the beloved disciple: Christ dies: The sun is darkened, the earth quakes, the rocks are rent, and the bodies of the saints and prophets are raised from the dead and appear upon earth: The priests and elders, alarmed by these prodigies, resort to Pilate and demand a guard of Romans to defend the sepulchre, lest the disciples should take away the body of Christ and pretend that he was risen: Pilate replies, that they have a watch; bids them see to it themselves and dismisses them.</P>

<L>Yet deem him not forsaken of his God:</L>

<L>Receiv'd his spi'rit, at length from mortal pangs</L>

<L>An angry Deity withdrawn from sight <MILESTONE N="695"/></L>
<L>And canopied in clouds: Him face to face</L>

<L>And fair and learn'd and wise: The Baptist here</L>
<L>Girt in his hairy mantle frowning stalk'd,</L>
<L>And, pointing to his ghastly wound, exclaim'd—</L>
<L>Ye vipers! whom my warning could not move</L>
<L>Timely to flee from the impending wrath,<MILESTONE N="760"/></L>

<L>So the last error shall outgo the first.</L>
<L>But PILATE, whose unrighteous judgment still</L>

<L>For what might them befall, and to their suit <MILESTONE N="805"/></L>

<PB REF="224"/>
<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>This Book opens with the scene of Mount Calvary at the coming on of evening; Christ still hanging dead upon the cross, the disciples standing apart and the holy women watching, amongst whom is the Blessed Virgin supported by St. John, Christ having bequeathed her to his care: His address to her on this subject, and her reply. The soldiers come and break the legs of the two malefactors, but finding Christ already dead, they pierce his heart with a spear and blood and water issues from the wound: They take him down from the cross and lay him in the sepulchre. His spirit in the meanwhile is conveyed by the angels into the region of Death; that region described, and the distant pro∣spect of the bottomless pit, where the souls of the wicked are in torment: Christ points out these scenes to Gabriel and instructs him as to the future objects of his descent into this gloomy region. Satan expelled from earth falls prostrate at the foot of the throne of Death: He makes suit to that power for protection: Death rejects his intercessions: The per∣son and palace of the King of Terrors described: The triumphant entry of Christ: Satan is hurled into the bottomless pit and there bound by the strong angel; the horrors of that dreadful abode are represented: Death humbles himself before the Redeemer of mankind, and conscious that his power is overthrown, tenders his crown to Christ as to his conqueror: He lays the key at his feet, which sets free the souls of the Saints, who are destined to be partakers of the first resurrection: This key is given to Gabriel with instructions for their release: Christ in his reply to Death forewarns him of his doom, but signifies to him that the dissolution of his power will not be immediate. The approach of the Saints concludes the Book.</P>

<L>NOW Hesperus renew'd his evening lamp</L>
<L>And hung it forth amid the turbid sky</L>
<L>To mark the close of this portentous day:</L>
<L>The lab'ring sun, in his mid-course eclips'd,</L>
<L>Darkling at length had reach'd his western goal; <MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>And now it seem'd as if all Nature slept</L>
<L>O'erspent and wearied with convulsive throes.</L>
<L>Upon his cross the martyr'd Savior hung;</L>
<L>Pale through the twilight gleam'd his breathless corpse</L>
<L>And silvery white, as when the moon-beam plays <MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>On the smooth surface of the glassy lake;</L>
<L>His thorn-crown'd head upon his breast reclin'd;</L>
<L>His arms were wide out-spread, as if in act</L>
<L>To' embrace and welcome the converted world:</L>
<L>So were they late expanded, when he cried— <MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L><PB N="224" REF="226"/>Come all ye heavy laden, come to me,</L>
<L>And I will give you rest! Death had not dar'd</L>

<L>Nor had the worm authority to taint</L>
<L>That incorruptible and hallow'd shrine,<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Wherein his purity had deign'd to dwell.</L>
<L>The living saints here mingling with the dead</L>

<L>Silent spectators of the awful scene:</L>
<L>There his disciples in a group apart,<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Like frighted sheep that cluster in a storm,</L>
<L>Throng'd each on other interchanging looks</L>
<L>Of sorrow and despair; no voice was heard,</L>
<L>No utterance but of sighs; though all had need</L>
<L>Of comfort, none had comfort to bestow.<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>But PETER, in whose self-accusing breast</L>
<L>Grief roll'd in tempests, had the whilst chos'n out</L>
<L>A solitary spot, where at his length</L>

<L>Or sacrilegiously divert the ear <MILESTONE N="60"/></L>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE EIGHTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>Christ, having closed his interview with Death, prepares to receive the Saints of the First Resurrection now approaching under the conduct of the angel Gabriel, and having ascended a mount in the midst of the congregation appears to them in glory: They pay homage to their Re∣deemer in a hymn of praise and thanksgiving: He addresses them in reply, and assures them of the blessings of immortal life bestowed upon them by the Father as the reward of righteousness: The patriarch Abraham enters into conference with Christ, in the conclusion of which the Savior of the world shews him the glorious vision of the heavenly Jerusalem, the holy city, as described in the Apocalypse: When this beatific vision is passed away, Christ reascends to earth in view of the whole assembly of Saints: The angel Gabriel, who is left behind, ad∣dresses them from the mount and expounds the purposes of the Savior's resurrection from the dead and return to earth: Moses recapitulates the events of his life, instances the frequent rebellions of the Lord's un∣faithful people, and laments their future impenitence and incredulity: Gabriel replies, and from the nature of man's free will explains the origin and necessity of evil, from which he deduces the benefits of Christ's death and redemption: And now the Spirit of God descending on the hearts of the righteous, inspires them with all understanding and know∣ledge, fitted to their happy condition: A Paradise arises within the regions of Death; Gabriel addresses them for the last time, and upon his departure the Poem concludes.</P>

<L>NOW had the Savior by the word of power</L>

<L>It's living source, upon whose border springs <MILESTONE N="460"/></L>
<L>The tree of life, bearing ambrosial fruits</L>
<L>Monthly renew'd and varied through the year,</L>
<L>Food for immortals, in whose balmy gum</L>
<L>And leaves medicinal a virtue dwells</L>
<L>So general and potential, that no pain <MILESTONE N="465"/></L>
<L><PB N="278" REF="280"/>Or ailment but here finds it's ready cure:</L>
<L>No tear shall wet this consecrated soil,</L>
<L>Nor feud nor clamor nor unholy curse</L>
<L>Disturb these peaceful echoes, here the saints</L>
<L>In sweet harmonious brotherhood shall dwell <MILESTONE N="470"/></L>
<L>Serene and perfect in the sight of God.</L>
<L>And hark! I hear seraphic voices chaunt</L>
<L>To their melodious harps the bridal hymn—</L>
<L>Now is our God espoused to his Church,</L>
<L>And from their heav'nly union are gone forth <MILESTONE N="475"/></L>
<L>Blessing and peace and joy to all mankind:</L>
<L>Now shall his saints eternal Sabbath keep</L>
<L>From death and pain and wailing and complaint:</L>
<L>All is made new, the old is pass'd away,</L>
<L>Time draws aside the faded scene of things <MILESTONE N="480"/></L>
<L>And Nature in immortal freshness blooms:</L>
<L>Now to the waters of the fount of life,</L>
<L>Perpetual waters, every soul may come,</L>
<L>And he that is athirst may freely drink:</L>
<L>But fire and brimstone in the burning lake <MILESTONE N="485"/></L>
<L>Shall be their portion, who revolt from God;</L>
<L>There with the Beast in torments they shall dwell,</L>
<L>Seal'd in their foreheads with his mark and drink</L>
<L>The cup of indignation to the dregs</L>
<L>Wrung out in anger, whilst their ceaseless cry <MILESTONE N="490"/></L>
<L><PB N="279" REF="281"/>Shall with the smoke of the infernal pit</L>
<L>Day after day for evermore ascend.</L>
<L>No more; for now the heav'nly vision clos'd;</L>
<L>Awaken'd from his trance the Patriarch turn'd</L>
<L>With grateful reverence to address the LORD <MILESTONE N="495"/></L>
<L>And giver of these new-discover'd joys,</L>
<L>When lo! ascending from the mount he saw</L>
<L>CHRIST in a cloud of glory on the wings</L>
<L>Of mighty Cherubim upborne in air</L>
<L>High-soaring, to this orb terraqueous bound,<MILESTONE N="500"/></L>
<L>Seen over-head diminish'd to a point</L>
<L>Dim and opake amid the blue serene:</L>
<L>His raiment, whiter than the new-born light</L>
<L>Struck out of chaos by the Maker's hand</L>
<L>In earnest of creation, sparkling blaz'd <MILESTONE N="505"/></L>
<L>In it's swift motion and with fiery track</L>
<L>Mark'd his ascent to earth; the host of Saints</L>
<L>With joyful loud hosannas fill'd the air:</L>
<L>Glory to God on high, was all their strain,</L>
<L>On the earth peace, good-will to all mankind!<MILESTONE N="510"/></L>
<L>Meanwhile th' Arch-angel GABRIEL, who yet kept</L>
<L>His tutelary station on the mount,</L>
<L>So bidd'n of CHRIST, with arm outstretch'd and voice</L>
<L>Commanding silence, thus the Saints bespake.</L>
<L><PB N="280" REF="282"/>Now is your resurrection sure, your joy,<MILESTONE N="515"/></L>
<L>Your glory and your triumph over Death</L>
<L>And hell made perfect; for behold where CHRIST</L>
<L>Your first-fruit is aris'n, and waves on high</L>
<L>The ensign of redemption; now he soars</L>
<L>Up to yon pendent world, that darkling speck,<MILESTONE N="520"/></L>
<L>Which in the boundless empyrean floats</L>
<L>Pois'd on it's whirling axle; there he liv'd</L>
<L>And took your mortal body, there he died</L>
<L>And for your sakes endur'd the painful cross,</L>
<L>Giving his blood a ransom for your sins; <MILESTONE N="525"/></L>
<L>Thither he goes to re-assume his flesh;</L>
<L>There, when his angel ministers have op'd</L>
<L>The sealed sepulchre, he shall come forth</L>
<L>And shew himself resurgent from the grave</L>
<L>To those whom he hath sanctified and call'd <MILESTONE N="530"/></L>
<L>To be his witnesses in all the world,</L>
<L>And of his resurrection after death</L>
<L>Their faithful evidence to seal with blood</L>
<L>Of martyrs and apostles, warning men</L>
<L>With their last breath to be baptiz'd and live; <MILESTONE N="535"/></L>
<L>So shall the seed be water'd and increase,</L>
<L>Till all the Gentile nations shall come in</L>
<L>And dwell beneath it's branches evermore.</L>
<L><PB N="281" REF="283"/>Now are the gates of everlasting life</L>
<L>Set open to mankind, and when the LORD,<MILESTONE N="540"/></L>
<L>Captain of their salvation, shall have liv'd</L>
<L>His promis'd term on earth, and thence to heav'n</L>
<L>Ascending seat himself at God's right hand,</L>
<L>Then shall the Holy Ghost the Comforter</L>
<L>Rush like a mighty wind upon the hearts <MILESTONE N="545"/></L>
<L>Of his inspir'd apostles; tongues of fire</L>
<L>And languages untaught they shall receive</L>
<L>To speak with boldness the revealed Word,</L>
<L>Enduring all things for the gospel's sake;</L>
<L>Troubled on ev'ry side yet not distress'd,<MILESTONE N="550"/></L>
<L>Perplex'd but not surrender'd to despair,</L>
<L>Afflicted not forsaken they shall be,</L>
<L>Cast down but not destroy'd, knowing that God,</L>
<L>Who raised the LORD JESUS from the dead,</L>
<L>Them also into life through him will raise,<MILESTONE N="555"/></L>
<L>And that the light affliction of this world,</L>
<L>Which is but for a moment, soon shall be</L>
<L>O'erpaid by a far more exceeding weight</L>
<L>Of glory' eternal in the life to come.</L>
<L>He ceas'd, and all were silent, wrapt in awe <MILESTONE N="560"/></L>
<L>Of the late glorious vision, yet in heart</L>
<L>Troubled for what the Angel had reveal'd</L>
<L>Of sorrows still to come and pains and deaths</L>
<L><PB N="282" REF="284"/>To be encounter'd by the Saints on earth;</L>
<L>When now that Shepherd, who on Sinai's mount <MILESTONE N="565"/></L>
<L>Commun'd with God and heard creation's plan</L>
<L>Expounded by it's Architect, thus spake.</L>
<L>Oh thou, whom through the fiery cloud I saw</L>
<L>On Horeb's hill, when tending Jethro's flock,</L>
<L>What time I heard my name twice call'd of God <MILESTONE N="570"/></L>
<L>In thunder from amidst the flaming bush,</L>
<L>Bidding me strait go forth to loose his sheep</L>
<L>From Egypt's captive fold, I do perceive</L>
<L>That I have penn'd the Word of God aright,</L>
<L>And now in CHRIST behold the woman's seed <MILESTONE N="575"/></L>
<L>Bruising that Serpent's head, who wrought the fall</L>
<L>Of our first parents. Forty days and nights</L>
<L>On Sinai's top 'midst thund'rings, clouds and fire</L>
<L>Fasting I stood, and whilst the hallow'd ground</L>
<L>Trembled beneath my bare unsandal'd feet,<MILESTONE N="580"/></L>
<L>I heard an awful voice, that bade me write</L>
<L>The glorious record of his six days work.</L>
<L>Aghast, confounded, dazzled with the blaze</L>
<L>Of glory, still my faithful pen obey'd</L>
<L>The sacred dictates of an unseen God:<MILESTONE N="585"/></L>
<L>I wrote, and to an unbelieving world</L>
<L>Publish'd the wond'rous Code; age after age</L>
<L>Libell'd the transcript: With the rod of pow'r</L>
<L><PB N="283" REF="285"/>I smote the seas asunder; Israel pass'd</L>
<L>Through wat'ry battlements; forty long years <MILESTONE N="590"/></L>
<L>In the waste howling wilderness I fed</L>
<L>Their murmuring tribes with food miraculous;</L>
<L>They fed but murmur'd still: I brought them laws</L>
<L>With God's own finger graven; I came down</L>
<L>Bearing Jehovah's statutes in my hand <MILESTONE N="595"/></L>
<L>On both sides written; impious noisy shouts,</L>
<L>Lewd triumphs and vile revels smote mine ear;</L>
<L>The people danc'd around a molten calf,</L>
<L>Monstrous idolatry! Raging with shame</L>
<L>I dash'd the stony tablets on the ground,<MILESTONE N="600"/></L>
<L>And shiver'd them to fragments; God was mock'd;</L>
<L>A stiff-neck'd and a stubborn race they were,</L>
<L>Who from the rock of their salvation turn'd</L>
<L>And sacrific'd to devils; and behold!</L>
<L>Their sons have crucified the LORD OF LIFE; <MILESTONE N="605"/></L>
<L>Therefore his resurrection, which shall be</L>
<L>Light and redemption to the Gentile world,</L>
<L>To them is darkness and the shadow' of death;</L>
<L>For they have slain the very Paschal Lamb;</L>
<L>That bloody symbol of their antient law,<MILESTONE N="610"/></L>
<L>Which I made sacred, they have now made void,</L>
<L>And cancell'd my legation: I perceive</L>
<L>A new commandment is gone forth; I see</L>
<L><PB N="284" REF="286"/>The temple's vail is rent; for the old law,</L>
<L>A carnal shadow of things spiritual,</L>
<L>Suffic'd not for perfection and the pow'r</L>
<L>Of an eternal life: CHRIST is become</L>
<L>That King of Salem, that immortal Priest</L>
<L>Of God most high, whose ministry supreme,</L>
<L>Before all time from heav'n itself deriv'd <MILESTONE N="620"/></L>
<L>And not from right Levitical, removes</L>
<L>All title from that consecrated tribe,</L>
<L>Where I had fix'd it. God, who sending me,</L>
<L>Sent but his servant, now hath giv'n his Son</L>
<L>More worthy of his glory; without sin <MILESTONE N="625"/></L>
<L>And spotless He, the great High Priest, hath pass'd</L>
<L>Into the heav'ns victorious over Death;</L>
<L>But I, whose trespasses at Meribah,</L>
<L>Frail sinful man, provok'd the Lord to wrath,</L>
<L>Saw but the skirts of Dan from Pisgah's top,<MILESTONE N="630"/></L>
<L>Unworthy deem'd to enter that fair land,</L>
<L>And died upon mount Nebo. But when CHRIST,</L>
<L>Who hath awaken'd us from sleep, shall rise</L>
<L>And in his mortal flesh a second time</L>
<L>Visit his Saints on earth, who then shall say <MILESTONE N="635"/></L>
<L>There is no resurrection of the dead?</L>
<L>Faintly I shadow'd forth a future life;</L>
<L>I spake not to men's senses, as CHRIST speaks;</L>
<L><PB N="285" REF="287"/>God gave me no commission to reveal</L>
<L>The secrets of the grave; corruption's worm <MILESTONE N="640"/></L>
<L>Spar'd not my flesh, nor came my spirit back</L>
<L>From Death's dark citadel to give mankind</L>
<L>Conviction ocular of his defeat;</L>
<L>I left him in his power till CHRIST should come</L>
<L>To break that sceptre, which had aw'd the world.<MILESTONE N="645"/></L>
<L>Much then it moves my wonder, much I grieve</L>
<L>That darkness shall not yet be drawn aside</L>
<L>From Israel, and that those, who would not hear</L>
<L>Me and the prophets, shall not yet believe</L>
<L>CHRIST their Messias rising from the dead.<MILESTONE N="650"/></L>
<L>To whom th' Arch-angel answer'd heav'nly mild:</L>
<L>Well may'st thou muse that reas'ning man should doubt,</L>
<L>And cause we have to grieve, when he neglects</L>
<L>So great salvation; but when CHRIST hath shewn</L>
<L>What is the good and true and perfect way,<MILESTONE N="655"/></L>
<L>Reason must do the rest: When all are free</L>
<L>Some must be faithless, wilful and perverse.</L>
<L>God could have made his creatures void of sin,</L>
<L>For he can put a master in their hearts,</L>
<L>And govern them by instinct; but to man <MILESTONE N="660"/></L>
<L>He gave a nobler faculty, a will,</L>
<L>A spark of immortality, a soul,</L>
<L>Reason to counsel that immortal soul,</L>
<L><PB N="286" REF="288"/>And conscience to restrain licentious will.</L>
<L>Grace shall assist the humble and devout; <MILESTONE N="665"/></L>
<L>A proud man hath no friend in heav'n or earth,</L>
<L>Renounc'd of angels and by men abhorr'd:</L>
<L>Truth must be sought, it will not be impos'd:</L>
<L>What were that revelation, which should leave</L>
<L>No exercise to faith? All men must work <MILESTONE N="670"/></L>
<L>With fear and trembling their salvation out.</L>
<L>God does not give free will to take away</L>
<L>What he hath giv'n; if man will sin, he must:</L>
<L>Nor do we call them good, who cannot err,</L>
<L>Else brutes would claim a virtue. None is good <MILESTONE N="675"/></L>
<L>Save God alone; impute we not to God</L>
<L>The evil which man does, nor him arraign</L>
<L>For not preventing ills which he foreknows:</L>
<L>Angels have sinn'd and some are fall'n from bliss;</L>
<L>All had their days of error, their degrees <MILESTONE N="680"/></L>
<L>Of good and ill, else why have we degrees</L>
<L>Ranks and precedencies of bliss in heav'n?</L>
<L>Call your own lives to mind; ye have been men,</L>
<L>Your failings many, yet your virtues more;</L>
<L>Why are ye now rewarded by your God?<MILESTONE N="685"/></L>
<L>Why but because those virtues were your own?</L>
<L>Ye made them what they were, ye rear'd their growth,</L>
<L>Reason reform'd the wild luxuriant soil,</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="289"/>Pluck'd up the weeds and nurs'd the glorious fruit.</L>
<L>Is there amongst you one that hath to boast <MILESTONE N="690"/></L>
<L>Human perfection? There is none that will.</L>
<L>A free yet faultless creature would be more</L>
<L>Than man, than angel; nor can God create</L>
<L>An equal to himself, a rival God.</L>
<L>In Eden's happy groves when man was plac'd,<MILESTONE N="695"/></L>
<L>One interdicted baneful plant there was,</L>
<L>Tempting and rich in fruit; all else was good,</L>
<L>Fair to the eye and wholesome to the taste;</L>
<L>Yet of that fruit man pluck'd and eat and died;</L>
<L>Tempted he was, but not compell'd to take; <MILESTONE N="700"/></L>
<L>Warn'd to abstain, no angel stopp'd his hand,</L>
<L>No thundering voice deterr'd him from the deed,</L>
<L>For man was free; so could he not have been,</L>
<L>Had God's foreknowledge over-rul'd his will.</L>
<L>Thus Sin had origin and Death began <MILESTONE N="705"/></L>
<L>His occupation with the human race,</L>
<L>More terrible for that he came with pangs,</L>
<L>Horrors and doubts on sin-oppressed man,</L>
<L>When conscience wrung him in the parting hour:</L>
<L>But still the inextinguishable soul <MILESTONE N="710"/></L>
<L>Mock'd at Death's dart, the body was his own</L>
<L>From the beginning; of the earth 'twas made,</L>
<L>The earth it till'd and from the earth it fed;</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="290"/>A tenement of dust was never form'd</L>
<L>Fox immortality; and now, behold,<MILESTONE N="715"/></L>
<L>Adam the earthy man, in whom all die,</L>
<L>Is buried to the world; redemption brings</L>
<L>The day-spring of Salvation from on high,</L>
<L>CHRIST in his glory comes, the LORD from heav'n,</L>
<L>And who in him have faith, in him have life.<MILESTONE N="720"/></L>
<L>He ceas'd, when now th' assembly of the Saints,</L>
<L>Who whilst he spake stood in their orbs unmov'd</L>
<L>Circling the mount, 'gan feel the Spi'rit of God</L>
<L>Descending on their hearts, and, like a sea</L>
<L>By secret currents from it's bottom stirr'd,<MILESTONE N="725"/></L>
<L>Wav'd to and fro their undulating files</L>
<L>Wide and more wide, as with a mighty wind</L>
<L>The heav'nly inspiration on them rush'd:</L>
<L>This GABRIEL heard and from the mount came down,</L>
<L>Which quak'd beneath his feet, whilst over-head <MILESTONE N="730"/></L>
<L>Loud thunderings announc'd the coming God:</L>
<L>And now a fire, that cover'd all the mount,</L>
<L>Bespoke him present; all the air respir'd</L>
<L>Ambrosial odours, amaranth and rose,</L>
<L>For Nature felt her God, and every flower <MILESTONE N="735"/></L>
<L>And every fragrant shrub, whose honied breath</L>
<L>Perfumes the courts of heav'n, had burst to life</L>
<L>Blooming, and, in a thousand colors dy'd,</L>
<L><PB N="289" REF="291"/>Threw their gay mantle o'er the naked heath:</L>
<L>Now glow'd the living landscape; hill and dale <MILESTONE N="740"/></L>
<L>Rose on the flat, or sunk as Nature shap'd</L>
<L>Her loveliest forms and swell'd her wavey line,</L>
<L>Leaving unrein'd variety to run</L>
<L>Her wild career amid the sportive scene:</L>
<L>Nor were there wanting trees of ev'ry growth,<MILESTONE N="745"/></L>
<L>Umbrageous some, making a verdant tent</L>
<L>Under their spreading branches, some of shaft</L>
<L>Majestic, tow'ring o'er the subject groves:</L>
<L>Blossoms and fruits and aromatic gums</L>
<L>Scented the breeze, that fann'd their rustling leaves; <MILESTONE N="750"/></L>
<L>And them betwixt a crystal river flow'd</L>
<L>O'er golden sands, meand'ring in it's course</L>
<L>Through amaranthine banks with lulling sound</L>
<L>Of dulcet murmurs breathing soft repose.</L>
<L>Thus at the sight of God spontaneous rose <MILESTONE N="755"/></L>
<L>A Paradise within the realm of Death,</L>
<L>Where that blest congregation might abide</L>
<L>Their LORD's return now visitant on earth:</L>
<L>And now th' Eternal having breath'd his joy</L>
<L>Into their hearts and giv'n them to discern <MILESTONE N="760"/></L>
<L>All knowledge, that befitted souls so blest,</L>
<L>Withdrew his presence from the flaming mount;</L>
<L><PB N="290" REF="292"/>Whereat the min'istring Angel, who beheld</L>
<L>Salvation's work complete, thus parting spake.</L>
<L>God, in whose presence pleasure ever dwells,<MILESTONE N="765"/></L>
<L>Hath for your dear Redeemer's sake bestow'd</L>
<L>These joys, and now his presence is withdrawn;</L>
<L>Yet hath he left his spirit in your hearts</L>
<L>To teach you all that is and is to be:</L>
<L>Behold, the cloud that veil'd your mortal eyes</L>
<L>Is drawn aside, and what as in a glass</L>
<L>Darkling ye saw now face to face is seen:</L>
<L>Ye now discern the ways of God how just,</L>
<L>How true, how wise, how perfect in design,</L>
<L>And well ye know that man, presumptuous man,<MILESTONE N="775"/></L>
<L>In a vain shadow walketh; ye perceive</L>
<L>His boasted mind sufficient for the things,</L>
<L>That to his own salvation appertain;</L>
<L>Yet when it scans the mysteries of heaven,</L>
<L>How false, how weak, how daringly absurd!<MILESTONE N="780"/></L>
<L>Firm faith, warm charity and humble hope,</L>
<L>These are the Christian graces, these the guides,</L>
<L>That lead to life eternal; thoughts perverse,</L>
<L>Pert quibbling follies, publish'd in the pride</L>
<L>Of false philosophy, are dev'lish arts,<MILESTONE N="785"/></L>
<L>That damn the instrument, who thus attempts</L>
<L>To hide the light of revelation's beam</L>
<L><PB N="291" REF="293"/>From weaker eyes, and turn the world from God;</L>
<L>These verily shall have their just reward:</L>
<L>And now no more; this Paradise ye see <MILESTONE N="790"/></L>
<L>Is but your passage to a brighter scene,</L>
<L>A resting-place till CHRIST shall re-ascend</L>
<L>To the right hand of God and call you hence</L>
<L>To share his glory in the heav'n of heavens.</L>
<L>He said, and swifter than the meteor's glance,<MILESTONE N="795"/></L>
<L>Sprung on the wing to seek his native sphere:</L>
<L>The Saints look'd up, then sung with joint acclaim—</L>
<L>Glory to God and praises to his CHRIST,</L>
<L>Judge and Redeemer of the quick and dead!<MILESTONE N="799"/></L>
