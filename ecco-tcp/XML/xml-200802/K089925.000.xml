<BYLINE>Written by DAVID GARRICK, Esq.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. KING.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>WHAT various transformations we remark,</L>
<L>From East Whitechapel to the West Hyde-park!</L>
<L>Men, women, children, houses, signs, and fashions,</L>
<L>State, stage, trade, taste, the humours and the passions;</L>
<L>Th' Exchange, 'Change alley, wheresoe'er your ranging,</L>
<L>Court, city, country, all are chang'd, or changing;</L>
<L>The streets sometime ago, were pav'd with stones,</L>
<L>Which, aided by a hackney coach, half broke your bones.</L>
<L>The purest lovers then indulg'd no bliss;</L>
<L>They run great hazard if they stole a kiss—</L>
<L><HI>One chaste salute—the Damsel cry'd, O fye!</HI></L>
<L>As they approach'd, slap went the coach awry,</L>
<L>—Poor Sylvia got a bump, and Damon a black eye.</L>
<L>But now weak nerves in hackney coaches roam,</L>
<L>And the cramm'd glutton snores unjolted home:</L>
<L>Of former times that polish'd thing a <HI>Beau,</HI></L>
<L>Is metamorphos'd now, from top to toe;</L>
<L>Then the full flaxen wig, spread o'er the shoulders,</L>
<L>Conceal'd the shallow head from the beholders!</L>
<L>But now the whole's revers'd—each fop appears,</L>
<L>Cropp'd, and trimm'd up—exposing head and ears;</L>
<L>The buckle then it's modest limits knew—</L>
<L>Now, like the ocean, dreadful to the view,</L>
<L>Hath broke it's bounds, and swallows up the shoe;</L>
<L>The wearer's foot, like his once fine estate,</L>
<L>Is almost lost, th' <HI>incumbrance</HI> is so great.</L>
<L>Ladies may smile—are they not in the plot?</L>
<L>The bounds of nature have not they forgot?</L>
<L>Were they design'd to be, when put together,</L>
<L>Made up, like shuttlecocks, of cork and feather?</L>
<L>Their pale fac'd grand-mama's appear'd with grace,</L>
<L>When dawning blushes rose upon the face;</L>
<L>No blushes now their once lov'd station seek,</L>
<L>The foe is in possession of the cheek!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
No head of old, too high in feather'd state,</L>
<L>Hinder'd the fair to pass the lowest gate;</L>
<L>A church to enter now, they must be bent,</L>
<L>If ev'n they should try th' experiment.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As change thus circulates throughout the nation,</L>
<L>Some plays may justly call for alteration;</L>
<L>At least to draw some slender cov'ring o'er</L>
<L>That graceless wit,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And <HI>Van</HI> wants Grace, who never wanted Wit. POPE.</NOTE> which was too bare before:</L>
<L>Those writers well and wisely use their pens,</L>
<L>Who turn our Wantons into Magdalens;</L>
<L>And howsoever wicked wits revile 'em,</L>
<L>We hope to find in you, their Stage Asylum.</L>

<P>Sir, if you could prevail with some-body else to do that for you, I fancy we might both fare the better for't—But now, sir, for my Lord Fopping∣ton, your elder brother.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn my eldest brother!</P>

<P>My dear Colonel, I am rejoiced to meet you here.</P>

<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Tom, this is an unexpected pleasure—what, are you come to Scarbro' to be present at your brother's wedding?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, sir, if it had been his funeral, we should have come with pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, honest Lory, are you with your master still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir, I have been starving with him ever since I saw your honour last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Lory is an attach'd rogue; there's no get∣ting rid of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, sir, as my master says, there's no sedu∣cing me from his service, 'till he's able to pay me my wages. <STAGE>(<HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, go, sir—and take care of the baggage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir—the baggage!—O Lord!—I sup∣pose, sir, I must charge the landlord to be very particular where he stows this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get along, you rascal. <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Lory, <HI>with the Portmanteau.</HI></STAGE></P>
<P>But, Colonel, are you acquainted with my propo∣sed sister-in-law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only by character—her father, Sir Tunbelly Clumsey, lives within a quarter of a mile of this place, in a lonely old house, which nobody comes
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
near. She never goes abroad, nor sees company at home; to prevent all misfortunes, she has her breeding within doors; the parson of the parish teaches her to play upon the dulcimer; the clerk to sing, her nurse to dress, and her father to dance:—in short, nobody has free admission there but our old acquaintance, Mother Coupler, who has procured your brother this match, and is, I believe, a distant relation of Sir Tunbelly's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is her fortune so considerable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Three thousand a year, and a good sum of mo∣ney independent of her father beside.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath! that my old acquaintance, dame Coupler, could not have thought of me as well as my brother for such a prize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad I wouldn't swear that you are too late—his Lordship, I know, hasn't yet seen the la∣dy, and, I believe, has quarrelled with his pa∣troness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Colonel, what an idea have you started?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pursue it if you can, and I promise you you shall have my assistance; for besides my natural contempt for his Lordship, I have at present the enmity of a rival towards him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, has he been addressing your old flame, the sprightly widow Berinthia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Tom, I am at present most whimsically circumstanced—I came here near a month ago to meet the lady you mention; but she failing in her promise, I, partly from pique, and partly from idleness, have been diverting my chagrin by of∣fering up chaste incense to the beauties of Amanda, our friend Loveless's wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have never seen her, but have heard her spo∣ken of as a youthful wonder of beauty and pru∣dence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is so indeed; and Loveless being too care∣less and insensible of the treasure he possesses—my lodging in the same house has given me a thou∣sand opportunities of making my assiduities ac∣ceptable; so that in less than a fortnight, I began to bear my disappointment from the widow, with the most Christian resignation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Berinthia has never appear'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O there's the perplexity; for just as I began not to care whether I ever saw her again or not, last night she arrived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>And instantly reassumed her empire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith—we met—but the lady not conde∣scending to giev me any serious reasons for having fool'd me for a month, I left her in a huff.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I'll answer for't, she'll soon resume her power, especially as friendship will prevent
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
your pursuing the other too far—but my coxcomb of a brother is an admirer of Amanda's too, is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and I believe is most heartily despised by her—but come with me, and you shall see her and your old friend Loveless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must pay my respects to his Lordship—per∣haps you can direct me to his lodgings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come with me, I shall pass by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you could pay the visit for me; or could tell me what I should say to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say nothing to him—apply yourself to his bag, his sword, his feather, his snuff-box; and when you are well with them, desire him to lend you a thousand pounds, and I'll engage you pros∣per.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>

<P>My Lord, methinks they look mighty well.</P>

<P>Aye, but you are not so good a judge of those things as I am—I have study'd them all my life—therefore pray let the next be the thickness of a crown piece less.</P>

<P>Indeed, my Lord, they are the same kind I had the honour to furnish your Lordship with in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LD. FOPPINGTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very possibly, Mr. Mendlegs; but that was in the beginning of the winter; and you should al∣ways remember, Mr. Hosier, that if you make a Nobleman's spring legs as robust as his autumnal calves, you commit a manstrous impropriety, and make no allowance for the fatigues of the winter.</P>

<P>My good Sir, you forget that these matters are not as they used to be: formerly, indeed, the buckle was a sort of machine, intended to keep on the shoe; but the case is now quite reversed, and the shoe is of no earthly use, but to keep on the buckle.—Now give me my watches, and the busi∣ness of the morning will be pretty well over.</P>

<P>He has given me a bond of a thousand pounds for helping him to his fortune, and has promised me as much more in ready money upon the day of the marriage; which, I understand by a friend, he never designs to pay me; and his just now refusing to pay me a part, is a proof of it. If, therefore, you will be a generous young rogue and secure me five thousand pounds, I'll help you to the lady.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUPLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without the devil's aid, I warrant thee. Thy brother's face not one of the family ever saw; the whole business has been managed by me, and all the letters go thro' my hands. Sir Tunbelly Clumsey, my relation, (for that's the old gentle∣man's name) is apprized of his lordship's being down here, and expects him to-morrow to receive his daughter's hand; but the Peer, I find, means to bait here a few days longer, to recover the fa∣tigue of his journey, I suppose. Now you shall go to Muddymoat-hall in this place. I'll give you a letter of introduction; and if you don't marry the girl before sun-set, you deserve to be hang'd before morning.</P>

<P>No, my conscience shan't starve me neither, but thus far I'll listen to it. Before I execute this project, I'll try my brother to the bottom.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>HOW do you like these lodgings, my dear? For my part, I am so well pleas'd with them, I shall hardly remove whilst we stay here, if you are satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied with every thing that pleases you, else I had not come to Scarbro' at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! a little of the noise and folly of this place will sweeten the pleasures of our retreat; we shall find the charms of our retirement doubled when we return to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That pleasing prospect will be my chiefest en∣tertainment, whilst, much against my will, I engage in those empty pleasures which 'tis so much the fashion to be fond of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own most of them are, indeed, but empty; yet there are delights, of which a private life is destitute, which may divert an honest man, and be a harmless entertainment to a virtuous woman: good musick is one; and truly, (with some small allowance) the plays, I think, may be esteem∣ed another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plays, I must confess, have some small charms, and would have more, would they restrain that loose encouragement to vice, which shocks, if not the virtue of some women, at least the modesty of all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, 'till that reformation can be wholly made, 'twould surely be a pity to exclude the productions of some of our best writers for want of a little wholesome pruning; which might be effected by any one who possessed modesty enough to believe that we should preserve all we can of our deceased authors, at least 'till they are outdone by the li∣ving ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you think of that you saw last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say truth, I did not mind it much; my at∣tention was for some time taken off to admire the workmanship of Nature, in the face of a young lady who sat some distance from me, she was so exquisitely handsome!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>So exquisitely handsome!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you repeat my words, my dear?</P>

<P>Because you seem'd to speak them with such pleasure, I thought I might oblige you with their echo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are alarm'd, Amanda?</P>

<P>It is my duty to be so when you are in danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too quick in apprehending for me. I view'd her with a world of admiration, but not one glance of love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take heed of trusting to such nice distinctions. But were your eyes the only things that were in∣quisitive? Had I been in your place, my tongue, I fancy, had been curious too. I should have ask'd her, where she liv'd (yet still without design) who was she pray?</P>

<P>I thought I had cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you thought wrong, Amanda; for turn the case, and let it be your story; should you come home and tell me you had seen a handsome man, should I grow jealous because you had eyes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But should I tell you he was <HI>exquisitely</HI> so, and that I had gazed on him with admiration, should you not think 'twere possible I might go one step further, and enquire his name?</P>

<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>Aside.</HI>)</STAGE> She has reason on her side, I have talk'd too much; but I must turn off another way. <STAGE>(<HI>To her.</HI>)</STAGE> Will you then make no difference, Amanda, be∣tween the language of our sex and yours? There is a modesty restrains your tongues, which makes you speak by halves when you commend, but ro∣ving flattery gives a loose to ours, which makes us still speak double what we think. You should not, therefore, in so strict a sense, take what I said to her advantage.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those flights of flattery, sir, are to our faces only; when women are once out of hear∣ing, you are as modest in your commendations as we are; but I shan't put you to the trouble of farther excuses;—if you please, this busi∣ness shall rest here, only give me leave to wish, both for your peace and mine, that you may never meet this miracle of beauty more.</P>

<P>I am so much of your ladyship's mind, Ma∣dam, that I have a private gallery in town, where I walk sometimes, which is furnished with nothing but books and looking glasses. Madam, I have gilded them, and ranged them so prettily, before Gad, it is the most entertain∣ing thing in the world, to walk and look at them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I love a neat library too, but 'tis, I think, the inside of a book should recommend it most to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LD. FOPPINGTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, I must confess, I am not altogether so fand of, far to my mind, the inside of a book is to entertain one's self with the forced product of another man's brain. Now I think a man of quality and breeding may be much more diverted with the natural sprauts of his own; but to say the truth, Madam, let a
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
man love reading never so well, when once he comes to know the tawn, he finds so many bet∣ter ways of passing away the four-and-twenty hours, that it were ten thousand pities he should consume his time in that. Far example, Ma∣dam, now my life, my life, Madam, is a per∣petual stream of pleasure, that glides through with such a variety of entertainments, I believe the wisest of our ancestors never had the least concep∣tion of any of 'em. I rise, Madam, when in town, about twelve o'clock. I don't rise sooner, because it is the worst thing in the world for the complex∣ion; nat that I pretend to be a beau, but a man must endeavour to look decent, lest he makes so odious a figure in the side-bax, the ladies should be compelled to turn their eyes upon the play; so, at twelve o'clock I say I rise. Naw, if I find it a good day, I resalve to take the exercise of riding, so drink my chocolate, and draw on my boots by two. On my return, I dress; and after dinner, lounge, perhaps to the Opera.</P>

<P>The greatness of your necessities, Tam, is the worst argument in the warld for your being pati∣ently heard. I do believe you are going to make a very good speech, but strike me dumb, it has the worst beginning of any speech I have heard this twelvemonth.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, my case in a word is this.—The necessary expences of my travels have so much exceeded the wretched income of my annuity, that I have been forced to mortgage it for five hundred pounds, which is spent. So unless you are so kind as to assist me in redeeming it, I know no remedy but to take a purse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LD. FOPPINGTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, Tam, to give you my sense of the thing, I do think taking a purse the best re∣medy in the warld—for if you succeed you are relieved that way, if you are taken—you are re∣lieved t'other.</P>

<P>Then thou art willing to receive it any how, strike me speechless.—But these are d—n'd times to give money in; taxes are so great, repairs so exorbitant, tenants such rogues, and bouquets so dear, that the Devil take me, I am reduced to to that extremity in my cash, I have been forced to retrench in that one article of sweet pawder,

till I have brought it dawn to five guineas a maunth—now judge, Tam, whether I can spare you five hundred pawnds?</P>

<P>Don't be in a passion, Tam, for passion is the most unbecoming thing in the warld—to the face.

<P>O Lord, Nurse, I'm so overjoy'd, I can scarce contain myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NURSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O but you must have a care of being too fond, for men now-a-days, hate a woman that loves 'em.</P>

<P>Love him! Why do you think I love him, Nurse? I'cod, I would not ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e if he was hang'd, so I were but once married to him.—No, that which pleases me, is to think what work I'll make when I get to London; for when I am a wife and a Lady both, I'cod I'll flaunt it with the best of 'em. Aye, and I shall have money enough to do so too, Nurse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NURSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! there's no knowing that Miss, for though these Lords have a power of wealth, indeed, yet, as I have heard say, they give it all to their sluts and their trulls, who joggle it about in their

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, but for that, don't deceive yourself, Nurse, for this I must say of my Lord, he's as free as an open house at Christmas. For this very morning he told me, I should have six hundred a year to buy pins. Now, Nurse, if he gives me six hun∣dred a year to buy pins, what do you think he'll give me to buy fine petticoats?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NURSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dearest, he deceives thee fouly, and he's no better than a rogue for his pains. These Londoners have got a gibberage with 'em, would confound a gipsey. That which they call pin∣money, is to buy their wives every thing in the versal world, down to their very shoe-knots.—Nay, I have heard folks say, that some ladies, if they will have gallants, as they call 'em, are forced to find them out of their pin-money too. But, look, look, if his Honor be not coming to you.—Now, if I were sure you would behave yourself handsomely, and not disgrace me that have brought you up, I'd leave you alone toge∣ther.</P>

<P>You give me so obliging a one, it encourages me to tell you in a few words, what I think both for your interest and mine. Your father, I sup∣pose you know, has resolved to make me happy in being your husband, and I hope I may depend on your consent to perform what he desires.</P>

<P>I will not believe it.</P>

<P>By the faith of a true lover, I speak from con∣viction.—This very day I saw them together, and overheard—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace, Sir, I will not even listen to such slan∣der—this is a poor device to work on my resent∣ment, to listen to your insidious addresses. No, Sir; though Mr. Loveless may be capable of er∣ror, I am convinced I cannot be deceived so gross∣ly in him, as to believe what you now report; and for Berinthia, you should have fixed on some more probable person for my rival, than she who is my relation, and my friend: for while I am myself free from guilt, I will never believe that love can beget injury, or confidence create ingra∣titude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I do not prove this to you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMANDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You never shall have an opportunity—from the artful manner in which you first shew'd your∣self to me, I might have been led, as far as virtue permitted, to have thought you less criminal than unhappy—but this last unmanly artifice merits at once my resentment and contempt. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Sure there's divinity about her; and she has dispensed some portion of honor's light to me:

yet can I bear to lose Berinthia without revenge or compensation?—Perhaps she is not so culpable as I thought her.

<P>Why then, sincerely, and honestly, Berinthia, there is something in my wife's conduct which strikes me so forcibly, that if it were not for shame,
<PB N="86" REF="91"/>
and the fear of hurting you in her opinion, I swear I would follow her, confess my error, and trust to her generosity for forgiveness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERINTHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, prithee don't let your respect for me pre∣vent you; for as my object in trifling with you was nothing more than to pique Townly; and as I perceive he has been actuated by a similar mo∣tive, you may depend on't I shall make no myste∣ry of the matter to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means inform him—for tho' I may chuse to pass by his conduct without resentment, how will he presume to look me in the face again!</P>

<P>You—who have dared to attempt the honour of his mistress!—Come, come, be ruled by me who affect more levity than I have, and don't think of anger in this cause. A Readiness to resent injuries, is a virtue only in those who are slow to injure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will be ruled by you—and when you shall think proper to undeceive Townly, may your good qualities make as sincere a convert of him, as Amanda's have of me. When truth's extended from us, then we own the robe of vir∣tue is a secret habit.</P>
