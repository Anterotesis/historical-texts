<P>Go, and do thou likewise.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN we seriously consider the frail, corrupt, and distressful State of Human Nature; when we reflect on the general Lot and Portion of Mortality; when we call to Mind to what Variety of Evils we are subject, to how many Diseases our Bodies are exposed, and by how many Anxieties our Minds may be depressed and tormented, we are naturally led to imagine that it must be the Business, Concern and Interest of every Individual to lighten as much as possible the general Burthen; that every Office of Tenderness and Humanity to our Fellow-creatures would of Course be duly and punctually performed by every one of us, as well knowing that all the poor Aid and Assistance which each particular could lend, would still be much too little and insig∣nificant Preservatives against the universal Calamity; that the most we can do is to soften the Distress which we cannot prevent, to sooth those Sorrows which we cannot remove, and to pour Balm into those Wounds which we cannot heal.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6"/>To diffuse this Spirit of Love and Tenderness, to increase this Philanthropy, to make Man sociable to Man, God, the Father, hath implanted in every Breast a Principle of Benevolence, and God, the Son, hath in his holy Religion strengthened, dignifyed and improved it. This Principle shineth forth with distinguished Lustre in every Page of the Gospel of Christ; it is taught by his Precepts and enforced by his Example: and there is not perhaps any part of Holy Writ, wherein it is more visibly or more warmly inculcated, than in the short and beautiful Parable before us, wherein the Virtue of Humanity towards the distressed is painted in the liveliest Colours, and proposed to us as an Object of our Ap∣plause and of our Imitation also.</P>
<P>As the following Discourse therefore is intended to enforce this Principle, I cannot I think more surely engage your Attention to it, than by</P>
<P>FIRST, Running over, as briefly as possible, the principal Cir∣cumstances of this affecting Narration.</P>
<P>AND Secondly, applying them to the present similar Occasion.</P>
<P><HI>A certain Man,</HI> says the Parable, <HI>went down from Jerusalem to Jericho</HI>; unfortunately for him, his Journey lay thro' a lonesome and melancholy Desart; a Place, as we are inform'd by those who were well acquainted with its Situation, so remarkable for the fre∣quent Murthers and Robberies committed there as to be called, <HI>the bloody Way</HI>; perpetually infested by the Sons of Rapine and Violence. By some of these our unhappy Traveller was beset;
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
and being unable and probably unwilling to resist, was quickly overpowered by them. They attacked and plundered Him, and not content with their Spoil, to their Injustice added Inhumanity also, <HI>they stripped and wounded him, and left him half dead.</HI> In this miserable and distressed Condition he remained, we may suppose, a long Time, expecting with Impatience the Arrival of some charitable Traveller to assist him; when at last, as the sacred Historian relates it, <HI>there came down a certain Priest that way</HI>; a Sight no doubt inexpressibly agreeable to a Man in so dreadful a Condition; a Person of his own Religion, and a Teacher of it also; One who; besides the common Ties of Humanity, was in a more especial Manner bound by his Order and Profession to Acts of Charity and Beneficence; such a one, he had Reason to expect, would have gladly embraced the Opportunity of doing good, and flown with Pleasure to his Assistance; how great then must have been his Grief and Disappointment when <HI>the Priest passed by on the other Side!</HI> The unfeeling Man must doubtless have heard his Groans and seen his Distress; but he purposely avoided crossing over that he might not be obliged to stop and relieve him; he re∣doubled his Speed therefore, and, without the least Regard to the Distress of an unhappy Brother, proceeded on his Journey. To add to the Calamity of the poor Traveller, we are told that <HI>a Levite</HI> likewise, <HI>when he was at the Place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other Side!</HI> It is impossible perhaps to read this Account without making the following reflection. How does every one, who hears the Circumstances of this melancholy Re∣lation, detest such Behaviour, and abhor such Inhumanity! and yet at the same Time how many amongst us are guilty of it! Do we not, almost every Day and every Hour, meet with Objects worthy of our Compassion and Relief, and yet are we not too apt, with the Priest and the Levite, to <HI>pass by on the other Side?</HI> But to pro∣ceed.
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
What the disappointed Traveller did not find, where he had Reason to hope, he met with, where he had no Expectation of it. <HI>A certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was, and when he saw him, he had Compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his Wounds, pouring in Oil and Wine, and set him on his own Beast, and brought him to an Inn, and took care of him.</HI> The <HI>Samaritans,</HI> it must here be remembered, were detested by the Jews as Corruptors of the true Religion, and Deserters from the true Worship: The Traveller therefore, who had already been neglected by the Priest and the Levite, Men who embraced the same religious Principles as himself, could not ra∣tionally expect that his avowed Enemy, the <HI>Samaritan,</HI> would take the least notice of him; he was notwithstanding most agree∣ably deceived; for the <HI>Samaritan,</HI> as we have seen, performed every Office of Friendship, every Act of Charity, necessary on the Occasion; not content with softening his past Evils and Misfor∣tunes, he endeavoured to provide against his future Wants; when he departed, says the Parable, <HI>he took out Two pence, and gave them to the Host, and said unto him, take care of him, and what∣soever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</HI></P>
<P>THUS generously and beneficently did the <HI>good Samaritan</HI> behave towards the truly worthy Object of his Compassion; no Wonder therefore that our Blessed Saviour should propose this Ex∣ample to the young Lawyer, and dismiss him in the Words of my Text with <HI>Go, and do thou likewise</HI>; that is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the present <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London</HI>'s excellent Sermon, on this Parable. Vol. 4. Ser. 14.</NOTE> Since you commend the <HI>Samaritan</HI> for acting like a Neighbour to the Jew, do you learn to act like a Neighbour to the <HI>Samaritan.</HI>"</Q> and to every other Fellow-creature in Distress.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9"/>THE Maxim inculcated in the Parable (and which indeed seems to have been the chief Scope and Design of it) has been often, but cannot be too often, repeated and enforced to us: Namely, that no national or religious Prejudices, no Difference of Party, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect, or Opinion, no private Jealousy, Pique, or Animosity should ever be suffered to diminish, weaken, or counteract the noble, universal Principles of Benevolence and Humanity towards each other. The <HI>good Samaritan,</HI> we see, extended his Bounty and Compassion to the distressed Traveller, without any Regard to his opposite Opinions; he considered him not as a <HI>Jew,</HI> whom he as a <HI>Samaritan</HI> was at Enmity with, but as a Man and a Fellow-crea∣ture, whom he therefore, as Man and Fellow-creature, was bound to relieve.</P>
<P>THE Words of the Text therefore may very properly be con∣sidered as spoken with a View not only to instruct the inquisitive Lawyer, to whom they were immediately addressed, but as <HI>written for our Learning</HI> also, as conveying an useful Admonition to all Mankind, and exhorting them to the Imitation of this illustrious Example; happy are those who have the Virtue and the Resolu∣tion to follow it!</P>
<P>PERMIT me then to apply the Circumstances of the Parable to the present solemn Occasion.</P>
<P>THANKS be to God, our own Times, heedless and unwary as they are, cannot be condemned as insensible to the Feelings of Compassion, or Strangers to the Virtues of Humanity; we be∣hold with Pleasure and Satisfaction the Spirit of Mercy and Ten∣derness diffusing itself on every Side. That Poverty, which our
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
Extravagance produces, our Pity relieves, and we at least endea∣vour to heal the Wounds which we have made, Hospitals, Schools, and Foundations rise up, flourish, and increase amongst us; and publick Vice and Folly is, in same Measure, covered and extenuated by public Generosity and Beneficence.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr, <HI>Brown's</HI> Estimate of the Manners, and Principles of the Times. Vol. 2. p 40.</NOTE>A certain superficial and declamatory but fashionable Writer of the present Age has indeed lately endeavoured (tho' we hope in vain endeavoured) to make Virtue ashamed, and put Charity out of countenance, to degrade our Pity into Weakness, and melt away our Humanity and Compassion into Fear, Cowardice, and Effeminacy: But surely Waters thus sweet and salutary can never flow from so sordid and corrupt a Fountain. Our Charity, I am satisfyed, ariseth from a nobler Motive. I would fain persuade myself (and, if it be an Error, it is at least an amiable one) that it proceeds from that generous benevolent Principle, which distin∣guishes and naturally springs from the Religion which we profess, the Religion of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the good, the charitable, <HI>the righteous</HI>; from that Beneficence which his example taught, and which only his divine Precepts could inspire. This is the lead∣ing, strong, and actuating Principle that directs the Heart even in this otherwise degenerate Age; it is this, which has already raised in so many the Ambition to become <HI>good Samaritans,</HI> the Am∣bition of using, like him, their Liberty to release the Captive, their Health to support the Sick, their Abundance to relieve the Indigent.</P>
<P>AND amongst all the fair Copies of this noble Picture, industri∣ously drawn by various Hands, there is not perhaps one which
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
comes so near to the Original, as that Charity which we are here met to countenance and recommend; a Charity so extensive in its Nature, so useful in its Effects, and so highly conducive to the Good of the Community, as to deserve all the Approbation we can give, and all the Assistance we can bestow.</P>
<P>THE Almighty Creator of all things hath of his infinite Mercy ordained that Man shall not in this Vale of Sorrow be afflicted be∣yond what he is able to bear. The Misfortunes incident to Mor∣tality seldom press too hard and too closely upon each other, and where they are permitted to accumulate, Power and Opportunity are given to Men to divide, and by dividing to lessen the Weight of them. Evils indeed, which when separate may be over∣powered, when united become intolerable.</P>
<P>POVERTY, whilst she is strengthened by Health, can struggle with Misfortune; but if she is oppressed by Sickness, she sinks down, and is unequal to the Conflict; Sickness, on the other hand, whilst she is relieved and supported by the lenient Hand of Affluence, lifts up her Head, and smiles on the Bed of Anguish; but if Penury entereth into the Chamber, her Wounds bleed afresh, her Pains increase, and she drops into Despair, and Death. What Praise then, what Admiration is due to that Hand which brings a Remedy for this complicated Disorder! Behold a Hand is stretched out; a Building is raised to receive the Sick, the Poor and the Miserable. This noble Charity has provided every Mitigation of these dreadful Evils which Humanity could suggest.</P>
<P>BUT this Hospital opens its charitable Arms to receive not only the Sick, but the Lame also.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="12"/>THE greater Part of the Poor in this Metropolis, it is well known, live by the Work of their Hands; they are obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o earn their daily Bread by the Sweat of their Brows; their Support and Maintenance therefore must depend on the Health of their Bodies, the unimpaired Vigour and Activity of their Limbs; and when, by any unfortunate Accident, these are hurt or weakened they are left intirely destitute. In so large and populous a City in∣numerable Accidents must inevitably happen, which no human Foresight could prevent, no human Prudence could guard against. Here, if Assistance is not immediately given, it can be of no Ser∣vice; if the Remedy is not at hand to be administered, it may as well not be administered at all. Before the Erection of this and other Edifices of the same kind, the Poor in such distressful Situa∣tions were left to perish in the Streets: <HI>The Levite</HI> perhaps only <HI>looked at them; the Priest,</HI> without regarding them, <HI>passed by on the other Side.</HI> Their Pains were either finished by Death, or cruel∣ly protracted by the Ignorance of Empirics, who lay hold of every Occasion to try wanton Experiments on the Poor, and play with the Lives of their Fellow-creatures. How noble then, how ne∣cessary, and how beneficial is the Institution which can prevent such Evils, relieve such Distress, and soften such Calamities!</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>good Samaritan</HI> saw the poor Traveller, lame, wounded, and stripped, he did not, before he relieved him, ask what Sect, Nation, or Profession he was of, <HI>Pharisee,</HI> or <HI>Sadducee, Jew</HI> or <HI>Samaritan,</HI> but flew immediately to his Assistance. To the Honour of the <HI>Middlesex Hospital</HI> be it remembered, that the Example before us hath in this Particular been closely copyed by it. The Generality of Patients are not admitted into this Place without Letters of Recommendation, that so the Merit and Condition of the
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
Object to be relieved may be more fully and thoroughly known; a Precaution highly proper and commendable; but at the same Time all <HI>Accidents</HI> are admitted without Recommendation: In these Circumstances no Recommendation indeed is necessary but what the Afflicted carry with them; at such a Time, but to look up for Re∣leif is to demand it of us, and but to want Assistance is to deserve it.</P>
<P>BUT the chief Pride and Glory of this extensive Charity is still behind; and that is, the Relief which this Hospital be∣stows on the weaker and more helpless Sex, when they are most weak, and unable to help themselves; <HI>when the Snares of Death compass them round about, and the Pains of Hell get hold upon them.</HI> Need I represent to you, that in this dangerous and distressful Hour all the Assistances, all the Conveniencies, all the Superflui∣ties of Affluence united are frequently found insufficient; the Powers of Medicine are too often ineffectual; the Resources of human Art, the Improvements of human Knowledge are all too weak to relieve the Pangs, and stop the Agonies of Nature; at this perilous Time, all the Tenderness of officious Friendship, and all the Endearments of Love and Affection are required to soften the Distress and mitigate the Pains of the afflicted Sufferer. What then must their Condition be, who at such an Hour have no Home to receive, no Friends to cherish, no Remedies near to assist or support them! In Behalf of such Objects I need not, I am sure, address myself to the softer Sex; there is an Advocate, I know, within your own Breasts that will make all I can say superfluous; Nature, that best of Orators, will plead the Cause of your afflicted Sisters with irresistable Eloquence; she will point out to you your Duty, and direct you in the Practice of it: If you are Women, if you are Mothers, if you are Christians, I need not ask your Aid, Protection and Support.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="14"/>HAVING thus enumerated the many Benefits and Advantages of this extensive Charity, and dwelt with Pleasure on the several Branches of it, permit me to draw these Rays into a Point, and shew you this benignant Sun in all its Heat and Lustre: Permit me to lead your Imaginations to a Scene which your own Eyes may at any Time see in reality.</P>
<P>BEHOLD a Groupe of sordid and miserable Beings, their Faces pale with Sickness, their Bodies emaciated by Distemper, their Hearts depressed by Sorrow and Despair; observe some of them so weak and disabled as to want the Power of reaching to the Hand that is stretched out to relieve them: Behold others with Limbs broken and distorted, deprived of Life and Motion, and with the Eye of Anguish looking up for immediate Assistance; behind them advances a drooping Train of mournful Females, oppressed at once by the Throes of Travail and the Weight of Penury, and labouring with all their Sex's Imbecility under a dou∣ble Burthen: Alas! Nature shrinks, Humanity shudders at the Prospect. But see, the Clouds divide, a Dawn of Comfort appears to dispel the Gloom, and beautify the Horizon; observe the fair Companion of Faith and Hope, sweet Charity, approaching to∣wards them; she lifts them up with benignant Hand, and con∣ducts them to her beloved Asylum. Pass but a little Time, and mark what succeeds to the first melancholy Scene. Behold the same Objects that entered into the Palace of Charity now re∣turning from it; observe the sudden, the astonishing Change; the Face of the Sick is lighted up with Smiles; the Roses of Health bloom upon his Cheek; the Warmth of Gratitude glows upon his Countenance; the Lustre of Joy sparkles in his Eye. Behold the lame Man once more rejoycing in the Activity of his Limbs,
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
and returning with fresh Vigour and Spirit to labour for your Ser∣vice: And lastly, contemplate the happy Woman, bearing now with Pleasure what she had so long borne with Anguish and Dis∣quietude; she carries in her Arms a smiling Infant, blesses her God, praises her Benefactors, and forgets all her Pangs <HI>for joy that a Man is born into the World.</HI></P>
<P>A SCENE so dreadful and so pleasing; a Contrast so striking, must surely warm the coldest Heart to Sensibility, and open the narrowest Mind to Sentiments of Love and Compassion, of Ten∣derness and Humanity. To reflect that by our little Contributions, by setting aside our Superfluities only, we have it in our Power to produce so astonishing a Change in the Circumstances and Condi∣tion of our Fellow-creatures, must doubtless afford that heart-felt Pleasure which is infinitely superior to every wordly Enjoy∣ment: A Pleasure which the Contributors to this noble Charity have felt, and long, I trust, will continue to feel.</P>
<P>LET us not then, my Brethren, be weary of well-doing; when the Edifice is large and spacious it must stand in need of continual Repairs to maintain and support it: This Charity, as I have be∣fore observed to you, is in its Nature very extensive; the Fund, therefore, raised to preserve it must be extensive also; the Number of Patients who are perpetually applying for Admittance, shew the Necessity of punctually continuing the old, and earnestly solicit∣ing new Subscriptions to it. Add to which, that the Hardness of the Times, together with the Scarcity and Dearness of Provisions of every kind, oblige many to take Shelter in this Place, who little thought they should ever have stood in need of it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16"/>LEAVE not therefore, my Brethren, this Labour of Love un∣finished: Let each Person, already concerned in the Support of this Hospital, consider the Whole as one miserable and helpless Individual whom he has taken under his Protection. The <HI>good Samaritan,</HI> we may remember, not only <HI>bound up</HI> the Traveller's Wounds and <HI>poured Oil into them,</HI> but <HI>set him upon his Horse,</HI> lodged and paid for him, and when at last he left him, provided in some Measure for his future Wants. If it would be cruel to neglect an Individual whom we had taken under our Care, so would it like∣wise be, but in a much higher Degree, with regard to the whole Charity. To withdraw the Aid we had once given, would can∣cel at once all the Merit of the Obligation; nor would it excuse those, who acted in this Manner, that what they subtracted from one Charity was bestowed on another, that it was the same Stream of Beneficence directed to a different Channel. This is the Child whom we have adopted, we are not to transfer our parental Af∣fection to any other, but to consider ourselves as bound in Honour and Conscience to feed and maintain it. I mention this, because Charities, God be thanked, are daily increasing amongst us; and the Fickleness of Men's Dispositions may dispose some to change the Objects of their Bounty: In this Case, as the Seeds of Bene∣volence sprouted up and blossomed in one Place they would wi∣ther and decay in another; Charity would by degrees defeat its own End and Purpose, and, like the Suicides of our Age, finally destroy itself.</P>
<P>To conclude, let us all devoutly intreat the Lord and Father of Mercies, that he would pour into our Hearts the Spirit of Mercy; that he would imprint strongly on our Minds the Image of the <HI>good Samaritan,</HI> and teach us to <HI>go, and do likewise.</HI> Let us intreat
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
him that our Charity may increase, our Humanity and Compas∣sion be daily strengthened and improved; that he will permit them to cover from his Eyes the multitude of our Sins, and that in kind Regard to the Poor and Afflicted whom he loveth, he will not be <HI>extreme to mark what we have done amiss</HI>; but, in the last and great Day, will suffer those whom we have relieved to plead in our Be∣half; that so, howsoever we may have offended him, he may yet look upon us with Eyes of Compassion; and say unto us, because we have considered the Poor and Miserable, <HI>well have ye done, my good and faithful Servants, enter ye into the Joy of your Lord.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An Account of the <HI>MIDDLESEX-HOSPITAL,</HI> for the Recep∣tion of <HI>Sick</HI> and <HI>Lame</HI>; and for <HI>Lying-in Married-Women,</HI> in <HI>Marybone-Fields, Oxford-Road.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE happy Effects arising from the several Hospitals, erect∣ed about these two great Cities, for the Reception of dis∣eased Poor will sufficiently justify the Institution of this.</P>
<P>Nature and Religion patronize every Instance of Distress; but they most powerfully befriend that deepest of all Distresses, Sick∣ness in Poverty. Sickness itself will excite Compassion, though alleviated by every Comfort and Advantage of Wealth. How much stronger a Sympathy then must arise at the Sight or Idea of Sick∣ness embittered by Poverty! Or, considered in another View, how affecting is the Condition of Poverty disabled by Sickness! This Affliction, extreme as it is, is known to be very frequent. Most Men are inclined, but few, very few in Comparison, have the Power to relieve it. Public Contributions, therefore, seemed the most likely Means to effect what the private Bounty of Individuals could not: This gave Rise, in the present charitable Age, to In∣firmaries; and the Continuance and Increase of the voluntary Sub∣scriptions, by which they are supported, are the strongest Argu∣ment that they have answered their End. But as there are some populous Parts of the Town, which on Account of their Distance, and the Number of their Poor, receive little Benefit from these
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
noble Designs, it is hoped, that the Situation of this Hospital, and its extensive Use in providing for the Distresses of poor married Women with Child, will recommend it to the Assistance and Con∣tribution of those whom Humanity or Religion inspire with Be∣nevolence.</P>
<P>†{inverted †}† The Qualification of a Governor of this Charity is an annual Subscription of three Guineas; which <HI>also</HI> entitles the Sub∣scriber to recommend, and have in the House at one Time, either one Sick or Lame Patient, or one Lying-in Woman, and to recom∣mend Out-Patients. A Subscription of five Guineas <HI>per Annum</HI> entitles the Subscriber to recommend one Sick or Lame In-Patient, Out-Patients, and one Lying-in Woman. A Subscription of thirty Guineas at one Payment, constitutes the Subscriber a Governor for Life, with the last mentioned Privileges. Contributions of lesser Sums than three Guineas <HI>per Annum</HI> are thankfully received, and intitle the Contributors to recommend one Sick or Lame In-Patient, and one Out-Patient at the same Time.</P>
<P>A Committee of the Governors (appointed quarterly) meet at the Hospital every <HI>Tuesday,</HI> at Ten of the Clock, to receive and dis∣charge Patients, and to transact the other necessary Business of the House; where every Governor, though not of the Committee, has a Right to be present, and his Attendance is received as a Fa∣vour. A Report of their Proceedings is made to the General Court held every Quarter, when the Resolutions of this Committee are approved or rejected.</P>
<P>The Physicians visit the Patients every <HI>Tuesday, Thursday,</HI> and <HI>Saturday,</HI> and on intermediate Days, when particular Cases require it. The Surgeons attend every Day.</P>
<P>Patients are admitted on a Letter of Recommendation from a Go∣vernor or Contributor, who may recommend In-Patients, and have Out-Patients on the Books, according to the Regulation above∣mentioned:
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
And when In-Patients are recommended, and there is not Room in the House to receive them, they are put on the List to be admitted on the first Vacancy, and in the mean Time are pre∣scribed for as Out-Patients. No Security is required for Burials. All Accidents are admitted without Recommendation. <HI>Tuesday</HI> being the Day appointed for the Admission of Patients, they are ex∣pected to be at the Hospital, with their Recommendations at TEN of the Clock. The Physicians and Surgeons meet every <HI>Saturday</HI> at Twelve of the Clock, at the Hospital, where they give Advice <HI>gratis</HI> to all such diseased Poor who shall come, though unrecom∣mended, and require it.</P>
<P>The charitable Designs of this Hospital were carried on for several Years in two convenient Houses adjoining to each other in <HI>Windmill-Street, Tottenham-Court-Road,</HI> where the first Institution in <HI>August</HI> 1745, was intended only for the Relief of the indigent Sick and Lame: But in <HI>July</HI> 1747, the Governors willing to render it more worthy of the Notice of the Public, by making it still more useful, resolved to extend their Plan to the Relief of the pregnant Wives of the industrious Poor: The <HI>first Example of this sort of Charity within this Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>The great Increase of Patients, occasioned by the Reputation of this <HI>two-fold Charity,</HI> obliged the Governors to think of enlarging their Edifice, as well as their Plan, and the kind Benevolence of the Public by Donations, Legacies, &amp;c. enabled them in 1755, to erect a much larger and more convenient Building, in a high and airy Part of <HI>Marybone-Fields,</HI> near <HI>Oxford-Road,</HI> wherein the Apartments for the Reception of the Lying-in, are in a separate Part of the Building, remote from the Sick and Lame; and that Ladies may conveniently visit the Lying-in Patients, without being incommoded by the Sick and Lame, distinct Stair-Cases lead to each, the Lying-in Wards having no Communication with the Sick
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
and Lame.—Married Women only are admitted (in the last Month of their Pregnancy) after they have been examined by the weekly Board, and on their producing an Affidavit made before a Justice of the Peace, of the Time and Place of their Marriage, and of the Settlement of the Husband, with the Manner the said Settlement was obtained, whether by Birth, Servitude or otherwise. And that this useful Branch of the Charity, the Midwifry Ward, may be made every Way beneficial, and not liable to any Objection, no Pupils will be admitted; the Whole being under the Direction of Dr. <HI>Brudenell Exton,</HI> Physician and Man-Midwife: And no Woman whatsoever, who has been able to prove her Marriage, and her Husband's Settlement, so as to avoid burthening the Parish wherein the Hospital stands, has been refused Admittance.</P>
<P>The Number of Beds at present are Sixty-Four.</P>

<P>Such Persons who are inclined to favour this charitable Design, are desired to send their Subscriptions, with their Names and Places of Abode to the Treasurers, at the Weekly Committee, held every <HI>Tuesday</HI> in the Forenoon at the Hospital; and in order to supply the current Expence of this Charity the Subscribers are requested to CONTINUE to pay their Yearly Subscriptions in ADVANCE.</P>
<P><HI>Subscriptions</HI> and <HI>Benefactions</HI> are likewise taken in at Messrs. <HI>Honywood, Fuller,</HI> and Co. Bankers in <HI>Birchin-Lane</HI>; and at Mr. <HI>Gislingham Cooper</HI>'s, Banker in the <HI>Strand.</HI></P>
<P>As every Governor has a Right to act at all Boards, and to en∣quire into the Affairs of the Society, they are hereby earnestly en∣treated to make frequent Use of this Power, <HI>especially by attending at the Weekly Board; and they may be assured that their doing so will be deemed a confiderable Addition to their Charity, and a very great Service to the Hospital.</HI></P>
<P>Those who are disposed to be Benefactors, by their last <HI>Will,</HI> have the following Form of a Legacy recommended to them,</P>
<P>Item, I <HI>Give and bequeath unto</HI> A. B. <HI>and</HI> C. D. <HI>the Sum of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> upon Trust, and to the Intent that they or one of them do pay to the Treasurer or Treasurers, for the Time being, of a Society, who now call themselves the Governors of the</HI> Mid∣dlesex-Hospital <HI>for the Reception of</HI> Sick <HI>and</HI> Lame; <HI>and for</HI> Lying-in Married-Women; <HI>which said Sum of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> I desire may be paid out of my personal Estate, and be applied towards carrying on the charitable Designs of the said Society.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Charges of erecting this new Building, together with Furniture and convenient Sewers, amount to near 3000l. which by the charitable Assistance of the Nobility, Gentry and others, the Governors have been enabled to pay: But there are yet wanting proper Paving and a Wall to enclose their Ground and Building, and render it as convenient as possible for the Uses of the Charity; towards which useful and necessary Purpose the Governors, ever rely∣ing on the Director of all Charities, entertain lively Hopes that this laudable Design will still continue to merit the Favour and Protection of the Public.</HI></P>
