<HEAD>THE Famous Prophesie OF THE <HI>White King</HI> and the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be necessary to inform the Reader that this <HI>Prophesie</HI> was writ <HI>seven hundred</HI> Years ago in <HI>Latin,</HI> and found about <HI>a hundred</HI> Years since at the pulling down of an old <HI>Monastry:</HI> All <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e parts of this <HI>Prophesie</HI> are already come to pass <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t this last, which you will find by the sequel is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>w at hand: The first thing that was foretold by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> was the <HI>Union</HI> of the two <HI>Crowns</HI> under one <HI>Mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rch,</HI> after the Death of the <HI>Maiden Queen;</HI> the ext thing was the Troubles of <HI>England,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eath of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Martyr;</HI> the third thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>as the <HI>Exile;</HI> and the fourth the <HI>Restauration</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ing <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; after that, this <HI>Prophesie</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>mes to the late <HI>Revolution</HI> and describes it; by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Eagle <HI>coming out of the</HI> East, <HI>landing in the</HI> South, <HI>nd coming to the</HI> West, <HI>where, at an old Castle that ands by the River side that washes the Walls of</HI> Bri∣ain<HI>'s Metropolis, the Great and Mighty Men of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ingdom shall come to receive him, and offer him their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ervice to catch the Old</HI> Lyon<HI>'s Whelp; the last Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hesie that shall come to pass is just succeeding the time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>at</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Scotland <HI>shall lose their former</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<HI>Names, and be swallow'd up in that of</HI> Great Britai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <HI>and then shall be explain'd this of the</HI> White King <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the</HI> Dead Man.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> White King, <HI>and his Character.</HI> He is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> great Red Dragon who is gorg'd and ready to burst wit the Blood of all Nations: He is known by the mighti∣ness of his Power, and the absoluteness of his Dominion The best of his Subjects are the greatest of his Slaves and his most applauded Acts of Devotion consist in th Multitude of Victims be has Sacrificed to the false God that he Worshippeth. His Honour is lodged in the num∣berless Number of his Troops: His Religion in th Breast of his Confessor; and his Riches in the Purs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of his Subjects; <HI>which, like the Unjust Steward, h useth at his own</HI> Will and Pleasure.</P>
<P>This <HI>White King</HI> you may plainly see by th Description is meant for the <HI>French</HI> King, who ha been so long foretold to be a <HI>Tyrant</HI> over his People and a <HI>Scourge</HI> to the Neighbouring Nations, as th <HI>Prophets</HI> of old deliver'd in dark Misteries thei <HI>Prophesies</HI> concerning the coming of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the down-fall of the <HI>Persian Monarchy</HI> under <HI>Darius;</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> rise of the <HI>Western</HI> under <HI>Alexander,</HI> and afterwards that of the <HI>Caesars.</HI> Can any thing point plainer at him than to say <HI>He is gorg'd with the Blood of all Nations,</HI> when there is scarce one in <HI>Europe</HI> whom the <HI>French</HI> King has not imbrued his Hands in their Blood? The next is as plain, which points at Power, and the Arbitrariness of his Government▪ and wherein he has made the best of his Subjects▪ which are the <HI>Protestants,</HI> without whose assistance he had scarce been able to have kept his Crown, now <HI>Slaves</HI> by sending several to the <HI>Gallies,</HI> and forcing
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
others to quit his Dominions. The rest of the <HI>Pro∣phesie</HI> is as true in every particular, and therefore needless to repeat.</P>
<P>The Time when the <HI>White King</HI> shall raise the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> and the Signs of his <HI>Coming.</HI> The Time when this shall come to pass shall be the time after <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> shall lose the Distinction of their former Names, and be swallow'd up in their Original Name of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And the Sign that shall be given shall be that when <HI>False Prophets</HI> arise, and shall pretend to raise the <HI>Dead Man;</HI> but this shall not be the <HI>Dead Man</HI> which the <HI>White King</HI> shall raise; for he is not a <HI>Dead Man,</HI> but to the Hopes and Expectations of the People he is Dead only, but shall rise again.</P>
<P>This is directly hit at the <HI>Union</HI> of the Two Kingdoms, and cannot be interpreted to mean any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ther thing, but what the <HI>Dead Man</HI> is wou'd look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> little doubtful, but the next <HI>Paragraph</HI> explains it, which if it did not the present times wou'd show that it has brought him to Life which every Bo∣dy thought was <HI>Dead,</HI> to us at least; but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hich is very particular, and wonderfully remark∣able in deed, is the Sign given us of those times that is when <HI>False Prophets</HI> shall arise and pretend to aise the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> before ever the other <HI>Dead Man</HI> hat was meant, was ever thought to make such a <HI>Resurrection.</HI> This is worth a serious Reflection to hink that just at a time when these <HI>False Prophets</HI> pretend to raise <HI>Emes,</HI> one of their pretended <HI>Pro∣bets,</HI> which is their <HI>Dead Man,</HI> the <HI>White King,</HI> in he <HI>Prophesie,</HI> is pretending to raise to us, the People of the <HI>Union,</HI> another <HI>Dead Man,</HI> contrary to all our Thoughts, our Apprehensions, or Expectations,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
and who this <HI>Dead Man</HI> is, the next Paragraph of the <HI>Prophesie</HI> shows.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Dead Man</HI> is the <HI>Lyon</HI>'s <HI>Whelp,</HI> which the <HI>Eagle</HI> had drove away from the <HI>Old Lyon</HI> before.</P>
<P>This part of the <HI>Prophesie</HI> is explain'd by that which foretold the <HI>Revolution</HI> by the coming of an <HI>Eagle</HI> out of the <HI>East,</HI> which was the then Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> afterwards our Glorious <HI>Restorer</HI> King <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI> who came to catch the <HI>Old Lyon</HI>'s <HI>Whelp,</HI> which may be plainly understood of the then <HI>Pretended Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales,</HI> who is afterwards all along call'd the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> which very emphatically shows us, He is a Person <HI>Dead</HI> and lost to all Reasonable Ex∣pectation. But this is the <HI>Dead Man</HI> which the <HI>Eagle</HI> had drove away from the <HI>Old Lyon,</HI> as this <HI>Pretender</HI> was driven from K. <HI>James,</HI> before he <HI>Ab∣dicated</HI> the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and therefore he is a <HI>Dead Man</HI> indeed that is excluded all hopes of Reigning, by the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s being Settled on the House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and in a <HI>Prote∣stant Succession</HI> for ever, so that he is actually <HI>Dead</HI> to the Law. Therefore we shall proceed to exa∣mine in the next place.</P>
<P><HI>The Business that the</HI> Dead Man <HI>is sent about by the</HI> White King. And the <HI>White King</HI> having War with all the Nations round about him, setting up one King, and pulling down another, at last raises up the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> which was the <HI>Old Lyon</HI>'s <HI>Whelp,</HI> and furnishes him with Wooden Horses to carry him to his Native Country, there to assault it, and destroy the Peo∣ple for the hardness of their Hearts, and their Infide∣lity in not beliening that the <HI>Dead Man</HI> shou'd come again, whom they spued out from amongst them long be∣fore.
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
This is the design the <HI>Dead Man</HI> is sent about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y the <HI>White King;</HI> but his Governour has disappoin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d all his Projects.</P>
<P>This Paragraph needs but little explaining at his time of Day, when we find the <HI>White King▪</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>etting up the <HI>Dead Man</HI> against us, and sending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>im to execute his own Designs. The <HI>Wooden Hor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s</HI> he is preparing for him to Visit the Land of his Nativity are the <HI>White King</HI>'s <HI>Shipping,</HI> wherewith he threatens to Invade us, and Force the Subjects of a Free State, and who Live under the happiest Go∣vernment in the World, to bow their Necks down to a Foreign Yoke of Slavery, under Pretence of a Person and Title that is absolutely <HI>Dead</HI> to us, and all the World beside this <HI>White King,</HI> this Scourge of the Nations, which, as the <HI>Prophesie</HI> says, <HI>Is for setting up one King, and pulling down another.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n the last place this <HI>Dead Man</HI> shall bring a Go∣vernour along with him; now who this Governour is will be worth while to enquire, because this Go∣vernour shall break the Neck of all his Designs in a manner that shall be acceptable to all the World, as the Prophesie further illustrates when it comes to the Destruction of the <HI>White King</HI> and the <HI>Dead Man.</HI> And this Governour seems to be directly le∣vel'd at the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> who shall discover all the Underhand Projects of the <HI>White King,</HI> to make a <HI>Property</HI> of the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> and so shall deliver up the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> that he may be no more a Disturber of the People, or a Handle for the <HI>White King</HI> to work all his dark Designs withal.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Dead Man</HI>'s Governour shall bring over his Charge, and then the <HI>White King</HI> shall leave the
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<HI>Dead Man</HI> to the Charge of his Governour, and there sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Consternation, and Confusion, and Amazement; but the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of the People shall not be spilt, nor shall Desolation or Des▪ction come near their Houses; for the Governour of the <HI>D Man</HI> shall deliver up his Charge to the Hands of them that quire it of him, and he shall be Crown'd with Honour for Wonderfulness of that Work; and the signs of it coming to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> shall be when the false Prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s that pretended to raise up th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <HI>Dead Man</HI> shall be confounded and dispersed Abroad, so t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> their Names shall be no more heard of in our Str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ets: And th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the <HI>White King</HI> shall be destroy'd from off the face of the Eart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the <HI>Dead Man</HI> shall never Rise again, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <HI>Peace</HI> shall be Est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>▪blish'd for evermore.</P>
<P>The Reader may observe that this Paragraph brings the <HI>Pro∣phesie</HI> down to a general Peace, if not to the last Day, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> none knows how near its approach may be: However we fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> by this plain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y that the <HI>Dead Man</HI> and his Project shall com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> to nothing, but he be made a <HI>Prey</HI> and <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to the Ambi∣tion and Tyranny of the <HI>White King,</HI> who shall be disappointe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> in the Trust of this Great Governour whoever he shall be; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> he seems resolved by the <HI>Prophesie</HI> to prevent the Effusion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Blood, by readily delivering up his Charge, which must imme∣diately put an End to all the <HI>White King</HI>'s Designs, nay the <HI>Prophesie</HI> seems to Point plainly at his own Destruction at Home, while he is so busied in forming Foreign Projects, and that the Time is very shortly at hand, for it says the sign of its coming to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ss shall be soon after this A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tempt in <HI>May</HI> next of pretending to rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e <HI>Emes,</HI> the false Prophets <HI>Dead Man;</HI> and when we find them disappointed in their Designs, as we have no reason to doubt but they will, then may we expect the fulfil∣ling of these things; That all Foreign Attempts against us will be en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>irely baffled; the <HI>White King,</HI> our Great Enemy, utterly destroy'd; the <HI>Dead Man</HI> in the <HI>Prophesie</HI> shall never rise again, that is, we shall be freed from all Fears or Distur∣bances from him, and then there shall be Peace to the End of the World.</P>
