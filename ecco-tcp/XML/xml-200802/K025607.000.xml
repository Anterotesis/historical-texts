<LG>
<L>SINCE Man is surely Born to Die,</L>
<L>And Rise to long Eternity;</L>
<L>Let Virtue guide his steps below,</L>
<L>That fearless, he may meet the Blow,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AS I am one of Human Race,</L>
<L>With Patience waiting heavenly Grace;</L>
<L>And Age has worn me fifty Years,</L>
<L>With tardy Hopes, and Swift-wing'd Fears,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>I'd Wish the Lees of Life to wear</L>
<L>Without the weight of Wordly care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HAD I my <HI>Wish,</HI> or <HI>choice</HI> to Dwell,</L>
<L>It should 'be some clean rural Cell,</L>
<L>Beneath the Shade of spreading Trees,</L>
<L>Whose murm'rings with a gentle Breeze,</L>
<L>Might Lull my Senses into Rest,</L>
<L>And sooth the Troubles of my Breast.</L>

<L>Where <HI>Pan,</HI> and <HI>Echo,</HI> sweetly Kiss! <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pan,</HI> the God of Groves, Woods, Mountains, and Shepherds, was beloved by <HI>Echo.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>Whose lofty Woods, and Sylvan Scenes</L>

<L>Seem to surpass old <HI>Tempe</HI>'s Grove, <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tempe,</HI> the most delightful Situation in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> a Vale surrounded with Woods, Groves, Rivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>That seat of joy, and springing Love!</L>
<L>Within thy Shade i'd fix my Cell,</L>
<L>There's none on Earth wou'd please so well.</L>
<L>Through the vast Globe I've wander'd o'er</L>
<L>And touch'd at many a distant Shore;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>Seen various Nations, <HI>Rude,</HI> and <HI>Mild,</HI></L>
<L>Nature improv'd, and nature <HI>Wild:</HI></L>
<L>Yet none have such Contentment given,</L>
<L>As thou, <HI>Dunmore,</HI> an earthly Heav'n!</L>
<L>Yet when I view thy mould'ring Walls,</L>
<L>Whose trembling Ruin daily Falls,</L>
<L>I must Lament thy Ancient Date</L>
<L>With him, that urg'd his luckless Fate!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A LITTLE Garden, form'd for Food,</L>
<L>Self-cultur'd, to enlive my Blood:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF Lab'ring in my Garden's bound,</L>

<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>HIBERNIA, may with Pride declare,</L>

<L>MY Garden Borders, set with Flowers,</L>
<L>Bedew'd with artificial Showers,</L>
<L>Shou'd Nature, heated, cease to deign</L>
<L>Her Friendly Clouds and dropping Rain:</L>
<L>There wou'd I scent the Damask Rose,</L>
<L>That in my vernal border grows;</L>
<L>And as it's sweetness meets Decay</L>
<L>I shou'd Reflect, and sighing say,</L>
<L><HI>Thus Life blooms up, and Fades away!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BENEATH my little Garden Wall,</L>
<L>A purling Stream shou'd gently fall</L>
<L>Whose limpid murmurings might glide,</L>
<L>Unmix'd, with any lustful Tide,</L>
<L>To violate her virtuous Bed,</L>
<L>And swell her Womb, with riseing dread;</L>
<L>Then leave her Stain'd to Weep and Mourn,</L>
<L>With various Mischiefs not her own,</L>
<L>As many a Wretch, has Woman done!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! lovely Sex! your Virtue keep,</L>
<L>Let no ill Thoughts disturb your Sleep;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>Take sage Advice, from him that knows</L>
<L>The strength, and Number of your Foes:</L>
<L>All sullied Arts, and Sighs despise,</L>
<L>Repell the Darts of guilty Eyes.</L>
<L>The glitt'ring Gem the Orient yields,</L>
<L>(The Flow'rs that deck the Fragrant Fields)</L>
<L>The Silks inrich'd with burnish'd Gold</L>
<L>(For these poor Beauty oft is sold)</L>
<L>All these true Virtue will outshine,</L>

<L>RAIS'D o'er the Brook, an ever-green,</L>
<L>The Vine, and Woodbine mixt between,</L>

<L>And view the glorious Hemisphere.</L>
<L>With Contemplation fill my Soul!</L>
<L>Admire the Beauty of the whole,</L>
<L>Then Praise the great Almighty Hand,</L>

<L>And live in Hope to merit Heav'n.</L>

<L>O! awful <HI>Phillips!</HI> cou'd I be</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>MY Habit, plain, devoid of Lace,</L>
<L>That Suits not an <HI>Autumnal</HI> Face:</L>
<L>A coarse dark <HI>Frize</HI> may fit my Age</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Winters Snow, and petrid Hail,</L>
<L>Deform the riseing Hill, and Dale,</L>
<L>And hoary Frosts disguise the Woods,</L>
<L>And bind in Chains the rapid Floods,</L>
<L>Within my Cell, I wou'd Retire,</L>
<L>And warm me with <HI>Kilkenny</HI> Fire.</L>
<L>A few well chosen Books I'd have,</L>
<L>Some to prepare me for the Grave:</L>
<L>The rest to pass my time away;</L>

<L>SOME Friends select, like <HI>Books,</HI> I'd chuse</L>

<L>To read a <HI>Play,</HI> I think no crime,</L>
<L>Or any other <HI>decent</HI> Rhyme,</L>
<L>Yet, shun all those whom <HI>Vice</HI> approve,</L>

<L>Revives the Sense, but drowns abus'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF I shou'd hear the early Horn,</L>
<L>With sprightly Notes awake the Morn,</L>
<L>Expelling Slumber from the Eyes,</L>
<L>Bidding the lazy Sluggard Rise,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>(To mount the fiery mettled Steed,</L>
<L>Who champs, and foaming to be Freed,</L>

<L>My Blood wou'd rouze me from my Cell</L>
<L>To view the Sport I lov'd so well:</L>

<L>And <HI>Walk</HI> such Hills I us'd to Ride:</L>
<L>Then, when the pleasing Toil was o're,</L>

<L>I'd to my quiet Cell repair</L>
<L>And Healthfull feed on homely Fare:</L>
<L>High Sauces but corrupt the Blood,</L>
<L>Diffusing Poison with our Food.</L>
<L>A little, Nature will suffice,</L>
<L>An <HI>Epicure</HI> was never Wise.</L>

<LG>
<L>WHEN Spring revives the flowry Field</L>
<L>And calls the Feather'd Race to build;</L>
<L>When they begin to strain their Throats,</L>
<L>With various, and delightful Notes;</L>
<L>I shou'd not judge it any Crime</L>
<L>To call back years of fletting time,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>And, tho those Days are long since past,</L>

<L>That social Balm to ev'ry Smart,</L>
<L>That Cordial to an aching Heart!</L>
<L>He that can feel by Simphathy,</L>
<L>Must lose his Wife, and love like me.</L>
<L>For Love in Age to Friendship turns,</L>
<L>And with a lasting ardour Burns.</L>
<L>Hale Youth, perhaps, may smilling seem</L>
<L>To taunt, and Ridicule this Theme,</L>
<L>But youngsters, I would have you know,</L>
<L>I once was young as well as you!</L>
<L>True Love was never thought a Crime</L>
<L>A pleasing Joy, a Bliss Sublime!</L>
<L>A beauteous Infant ever mild,</L>

<L>When his chast Bow, and thrilling Dart:</L>
