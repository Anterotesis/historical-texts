<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the following Play comes into the World under some Disadvantage, I am happy in your Permission to shelter it under your Name.</P>
<P>BUT though it did not stand in need of your Favour and Patronage upon many Accounts; yet it should be re∣membred, that, in point of Propriety, you have an undoubted Right to these Sheets, whether you are considered as a Person sincerely attached to the Uni∣versity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> or particularly in∣teresting
<PB REF="3"/>
yourself in the Welfare of <HI>Pembroke-College;</HI> to the Regard and Affection of which Society you have a double Claim, both as an Ornament, and a Benefactor.</P>
<P>THE common Topics of Panegyric are obvious; and I have here a fair and agreeable Opportunity of taking Notice of those many amiable Qualities, which adorn you in public and private Life, and for which you are so justly beloved and esteemed: But my In∣clination is corrected by a seasonable Thought, that most Writers of the pre∣sent Age have, in this respect, a parti∣cular Advantage over me, as it is infi∣nitely more easy to make a Character, than to describe one.</P>
<P>BESIDES, it would be needless to en∣ter into a Detail of those Praises, which are already in the Mouth of every Well∣wisher to his Country: But I cannot resist the Impulse of Gratitude, which points to that Part of your Character, which more immediately affects me;
<PB REF="4"/>
your Good-nature and Condescension, to which I am indebted for the Ho∣nour of your Acquaintance and Friend∣ship, and for your favourable Accept∣ance of the following Poem.</P>
<P>GIVE me Leave to assure you, Sir, that if I am anxious for the Fate of this Tragedy, one principal Motive for it, is, the amusing Hope of transmitting to Posterity a Monument of the Regard and Veneration I have for the Person and Character of Sir JOHN PHILIPPS. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your much obliged, And most humble Servant,
WILLIAM HAWKINS.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS TRAGEDY having been offered to the Managers of <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI> Theatre, who de∣clined accepting it, for Reasons which ap∣peared to the Author to be rather evasive, than satis∣factory, he thinks proper to submit it to the Judg∣ment of the Public: And as he is not conscious of having had the least Intention to give Offence, and no particular Passage has been excepted against, he begs no other Prepossessions in its Favour, on this Account, than the reasonable Allowances of a can∣did and impartial Disposition. The Play has indeed received some considerable Alterations since it came from Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s Hands: But, as these Altera∣tions have no manner of Connexion with what the Author presumes was the principal Objection to the Whole (for, having had no clear Intimation, he can only speak by Conjecture), he does not think him∣self obliged to explain himself further on that Head.</P>

<L>Ev'n HENRY'S Love has cost me many a Pang.</L>
<L>Peace is the glorious Privilege of Virtue.</L>

<LG>
<L>Call'st thou it Merit, to confess a Crime,</L>
<L>Thou dar'st no more deny, than vindicate?</L>
<L>Strive not in vain to deprecate my Wrath:</L>
<L>Think on the Anguish of an injur'd Wife;</L>
<L>Think on the Torture of a slighted Lover;</L>

<L>Much have I sinn'd indeed. If Love's a Sin,</L>

<L>Who knows not female Passions lordly Rule,</L>
<L>Impatient ever of cool Judgment's Sway?</L>
<L>Disgrace, Confusion, Ruin, Rage, and Death,</L>

<L>What, let thee live to triumph o'er my Folly,</L>

<L>Each scornful Tongue, that hail'd my happier Days,</L>

<L>Upon the Refuse of gorg'd Appetite.</L>
<L>And when the Wrath of Heav'n is satisfy'd,</L>
